Too Many Visiting Assistants Diminish
Teaching Quality and Hurt Davidson

By David Smyth

Those of you perusing the
Opinions section of The
Davidsonian last week had the
opportunity to read some of the
most unenlightened sentiments
ever tendered in these pages.

We asked five students--Nel-
son Neale, Sarah Beth Grant, Billy
Smith, Robert Coggins, and Laura
Cunningham--their thoughts on the
prodigious number of visiting as-
sistant professors Davidson now
finds itself employing.

Of the five, only Cunningham
exhibited clear thought in their
responses. Let us all cringe but
take another look at some of what
these students had to say:

Coggins opinéd: ““Davidson’s
ability to bring in quality visiting
professors leads to a positive im-
pacton oureducation. Weare lucky
to have various experts--with vary-
ing perspectives--willing to share
their knowledge with us.”
Well, Mr. Coggins, if we’re pay-
ing them, I certainly hope they
would condescend to sharing their
knowledge with us cretins, but that
is beside the point. To correct your
misled statement, it is Davidson’s
ability to attract outstanding ten-
ured professors that improves our
education, not fly-by-night visi-
tors.

Grant noted that Davidson is
slowly overcoming aregional repu-

tation, and that visiting professors
are going to be the ones that lead us
to the promised land.

If we are as provincial as Miss _

Grant insists (and I am not for one
minute saying that we are), then
how in the hell are our temporary
instructors going to revive the

image? By wowing the academic

world with their particular insights
that only a visiting twenty-five
year-old teacher can give? Ithasn’t
happened yet, at least not here.
Smith and Neale pointed out
that “new ideas are great for an
academic community” and that “it
has a positive effect on education.”
That’s wonderful, but there again,
these are not ideas that our stu-
dents will not glean from them-
selves or from our well-qualified
tenure-track professors!
Cunningham was the only one
to proffer a well-considered re-
sponse to the question. Since she is
the single oasis in this desert of
naivety, I would like to reprint her
comments in total here: “Visiting
professors have a hard time fitting
in at Davidson. They are usually
unfamiliar with the academic stipu-
lations of the honor code, includ-
ing self-scheduled exams and take-
home tests. Because they are only
temporary members in their de-
partments, the visiting professors
cannotestablish the lasting rapport
characteristic of student faculty

Depth! Relevance!
On Davidson:
A Prospectus, With Uplifting Notes for the Reader

Being lately inundated, and
taking no small pleasure in the
perusal, with the fictional works of
18th century British writers, the
present author, in humble tribute
to such late esteeméd scribes, will
be grateful in the contribution of a
brief chapter, (the heading of which
will inform the careful reader
should any occurrences be forth-
coming in said chapter), for the
purpose of the education, moral
uplift, and virtuous pleasure, mind:
ful of the not unprofligate use of
commas in deference to style, of
the Youthful folk in this our De-
generate Age.

On the selfdeterminative quest
of the Dork. Further hints to the
itinerant concerning the sights and
sounds of Davidson College,anda
note in conclusion onvisual propa-
ganda with moral rejoinder,

The following questions |
should help certify the reader's.
- existenceasa Dork, or, to avoid all
pretense of personal invective, help
determine said reader’s tendency
toward dorkiness (for readers fas-
cinated by euphemisms, this usu-
ally isn’thard): Answer: Yes/No.

Did you, reader, not notice the

tongues of the perpetrators during -
last week’s protestations against _

that precious trinketof Americana,
Fantasia, lodged firmly in the

aforementioned
cheeks? -- Dork.

Do you bear the weight of
loudly thonking headphones in a
basementcarrel of the library while
flipping through a large hard-back
tome? -- Perhaps college is not for
you.

Are you a freshman? -- Rhe-
torical question (look it up).

_ Did you feel letdown when the
Coup failed? -- For shame.

Do you now prevent one of the
seats from taking flight in the halls
of the Student Government Asso-
ciation? -- Atone time, positive re-
assurances concerning this ques-
tion entailed instant Dork status.
An acquaintance of mine, how-
ever, recently gained the upper
hand on one of these seats. He
insists that without such martyrsas
himself, none of us would have a
Governmental Association for
"Students, and gloats in a victory
that the present author considers
but pyrthic. The dorkiate efficacy
of this question, therefore, remains,
in the words of some ancients, a
toss up.

Do you feel enticing when
drunk? -- Please leave your phone
# in the Opinions box.

Do you like museums? -- Dork
with a capital “O.” That spells,
dOrk.

relationships.”
Hear, hear.
According to this year’s course

catalogue, fifteen of the eighteen

faculty appointments are visiting
professors. I propose that this is
dangerous for Davidson College
for several reasons.

The first, and the most obvious,
is that many of these teachers are
very young and inexperienced in
the ways of handling the pressures
of teaching at a college the caliber
of Davidson. Idonotthink lam
being presumptuous when I say
that there should be a certain
amount of dues-paying for some-
one to be allowed to teach here.
Davidson students certainly had to
work very hard in high school to
gain admission; the same logic
should apply to professors.

Second, and this is closely re-
lated to the first, often visiting
professors are working on their
own dissertations while teaching
introductory classes. Or worse, they
do not have doctoral theses to fin-
ish at all. I did not come here to be
taught by graduate students, and I
doubt that anyone else did, either.
What is going to happen when a
visiting professor refuses help for
astudent’s project because of work
that needs to be done on his own
doctoral work?

Davidson is not a research in-
stitution! We are a liberal arts col-

Are youan Upper Class patron
of the Commons? -- You worm.

Do you not feel requisitioned
by the gods when the Braves lose?

David Scott

-- Away Paragon of Dorkhood,

Did the reader finally address
the necessity of a mountain bike
when the reader tired of going
around steps? -- D---, take it from
here.

Finally, do you, reader, utilize
only one of the equally functional
straps of your Jansport? -- All bow
to the Monarch of Dorkdom.

tas!

Visiting professors are inher-
ently temporary, and this brings up
my third point. At best, this merely
affects the student-faculty relation-
ships that we are so proud of here.
Your favorite teacher and budding
mentor from History 120 is gone
by your junior year. Oh, forget it;
you didn’t need that graduate
school recommendation, anyway.

At worst, their course descrip-
tions can scriously disrupt plan-
ning in particular majors when
regular professors return. What
happens when the visitor’s Abnor-
mal Psychology class hardly re-
sembles the regular teacher's? The
students do not know what they’re
getting and suffer as a result.

My point in writing this piece is
not to belittle or otherwise hurt the
feelings of any of our visiting
professors. I am sure they are fine
people. I am also sure that most of
them could make superb Davidson
professors some day.

The problem is that they are
stopgaps for an errant policy that
forces many of our distinguished
teachers to make names for them-
selves in the name of scholarship.
While these regulars are off keep-
ing their jobs, life here goes on.
Courses must be taught, and the
second string has to be put in. That
is bad for you, bad for me, and bad
for Davidson.

Ahh, let‘s see. Who hasn‘t
been offended yet? Here‘s a good
one; I saw a bumper sticker yester-
day that neatly sums up my feel-
ings on animal rights. Let‘s share
it, shall we?

“I Love Animals! They‘re
Delicious! [Eat Them Three Times
aDay. Mmm mmm good. Call 1-
800-Carnivore.”

Isn‘t that special?

What? You‘re aghast? Itisn‘t
PC? I would be willing to bet that
a good deal more of you agree with
that bumper sticker than with those
wonderful folks that take it upon
themselves to scream obscenities
and throw blood on little old ladies
foolish enough to wear fur coats on
the streets of Manhattan. Butthat‘s

ours?

here because I wanted a small lib-

would care about teaching and,
specifically, me. NowI’maboutto

Yes, we note, both the “R” and

which may imply some connec- -

“PRIDE,” however, being the most
vehemently underscored, mustplay
some central role.
