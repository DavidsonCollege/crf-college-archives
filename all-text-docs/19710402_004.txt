sa Hear No Evil...

Whatever students might have thought that the
Rennie Davis issue settled with respect to freedom
of expression on the Davidson College campus pass-
ed by the boards on Monday with the cancellation of
“Groove Tube.”

_ The issue which needs to be raised in cases such

ag the

Davis speech and the decision Monday goes

beyond particulars. It is of secondary importance that
; may or may not have been obscene or
boring, creative or humorous. The key issue is the

movie

range of college - sponsored experiences to which Da-
vidson students will be exposed in their four years
here,

"It is a judgment on the part of the members
of {fie executive committee of the college union that
the film did not represent the type of thing which
they cared to promote. This implies a position among
the ‘hiembers of the committee that they have been
elected to use their own judgments and values in
deciding what kind of entertainment will be avail-

able to the

students here.

With the movie here it certainly seems that more
than the twenty students and social committee mem-
bers might have been permitted to see the “gross
movie” and form their own judgments in the matter.

“The union board should be required to make
a ‘statement of its precise interpretation of its role
on the campus. If it intends to serve as Sunday school

= for the other six days of the week, it should make that"

intention known.
Lester Strong as president of the union board
has indicated that he initiated the cancellation de-

cision on: the grounds that ‘Groove Tube’ was not the
kind of entertainment: that the union

ard could

support and endorse, therefore it should not be shown.
_ As the charter does not specify what kind of
_ entertainment the union is to “endorse,” such inter-
pretation lies with the board to make, an interpreta-

tion which “th

e board has not made.

It. should be made clear to the union that others
have interests in entertainment which may not be
the same as C. Shaw Smith’s and that these could be
shown to let others make up their’ minds as well.

Making Ends Meet?

. There are two important problems which face

most small, private colleges

these days,

financial

straits and the problem of student-faculty-admini-
stration dialogue.

..._In its role as archetypal small, private (not to

mefition Presbyterian, liberal arts and male) college,
Davidson has come full face against these difficul-

ties. So far we have mastered neither.

__ The latest increases in the costs of attending Da-
vidson are understandable from an economic stand-

point, if you have been fortunate enough to. hear

the word on the economy and the college from an

administrator in the financial section. ;
They are much harder to justify in terms of

dialogue which would seem to be a characteristic of
a college community. }
_,. The administration has let the financial situa-
tion detoriorate before it has responded as it has
in the past year with the appointment of _per-
sonnel with the responsibility for finding funds for

the college.

In the meantime it is the faculty and particularly
the students which have borne the brunt of the in-
flationary forces at work in the country.

No. more faculty. members seem destined to raise
to the rank of full professor because of the additional
funds which the position demands in terms of salary.
Just. this year President Spencer has gone before the
faculty to. explain that salary increases would be. at
best minimal since the college is caught by the same
inflationary forces which the faculty members meet
in the grocery store. : .
ni It_ is ae: edents na ie been hardest hit,
owever. Since the college has stopped guaranteein,
the costs. to the. individual for all four ears that his
class is at Davidson, costs have risen steadily each

year.

In a decision which has as much direct impact
dents’ as the recently announced price
creases, ;the administration has not seen fit to con-

in-

sult’ with ‘the. students .at all, explaining only after

the fact.

Burney, Rowland Attack
Union Censorship Decision

The Union has done it
again.

The Union has proclaimed
that we are babies. The Un-
ion has decided that we

«should live in a womb, pro-

tected from all evil. The Un-
ion wants us to live in the
land of ‘‘in loco parentis’’. C.
Shaw Smith and his cronies
have protected us from
“‘Groove Tube.”’

Lester Strong, Duff Bruce,
and C. Shaw Smith banned
“Groove Tube’ on grounds
that it was not up to the
standards of other Union pro-
grams. e

Let’s review a few of the
quality programs which did
measure up to the standards
of the Union regime:

1. Ma Ho Pin, who in scan-
ty attire, pranced up one
skinny rope to the top of
Watts and slithered down an
other to the awe of those be-
low.

27SPhe late “Boros the
Great,’’ a pole sitter, -who
after several sits at David-
son fell for a shopping cen-
ter crowd.

3. A card shark billed as
‘Dick Snavely—Short-Sleev-
ed ‘Magician” (an old friend
of Shaw Smith) who we dis-
covered, after a few tricks,
was playing with less than a
full deck.

4. A baby elephant brought
four years ago for an appear-
ance in the Morrison Room
where his main trick was to
take a dump in a shovel.

5. ‘Several of Uncle Sam’s
big ugly paratroopers ex-
creted themselves from the
sky to drop in on this year's
homecoming. :

6. Highlights from the cin-

ema have included a contin-

uing series of Annette Fini-

Cello and Frankie Avalon’

movies. Also, it seems. that

the Union holds a lifetime:

subscription to all the John
Wayne classics...

7. A potpourri: of circus’
sideshows ranging: from. kid-.

cial talent was to play a saw.
$. Just this last week, we
have seen members of the
Union Board in a. magnifi-
cent puppet act, with Shaw
Smith pulling the strings.
‘Lester, Duff, and Shaw said

“Groove Tube’ was not in ,

good taste, but we say that,

given our druthers, we would |

rather see “‘Groove Tube”’
than such things as an ele-
phant going pooh-pooh.

The point is, of course, that
we are no longer babies. We
should no longer be subject-
ed to people who try to shove
pacifiers into our mouths and

_ put blinders onto our eyes.

Behind all of. the recent dif-
ficulty with ‘‘Groove Tube”
lies what. might be called
the’ “Spencer Ethic.’’ The
Spencer Ethic endorses a
policy of prudery and snob-
bery. It is a rather elusive
phenomenon, and one certain-
ly has to be on one’s toes to

watch for it. itn, Z

, gq

The Spencer Ethic emerg-
ed most clearly last spring
when Spencer, Shaw Smith,
and Rupert Barber ganged
up on a play written by a tal-
ented Davidson student. They
claimed the play was ‘‘blas-
phemous,”’ and they barred
it from a performance in the
(Morrison Room.

Our administrative friends
claimed that the College had
a responsibility to the ‘'C.C.
C.”’ (Continuing College Com-
munity—Sarah Penland, Del
Logan, and Lucy Johnston,
co-chairmen) to purge the
campus of blasphemy and all
that is wrong, bad, and evil.
In supporting=the C.C.C., the
administration decided that
that the. concept of academic
freedom as far as Davidson
was concerned was unneces-
sary.

The fate of this student
play last year is so similar
to the fate of ‘‘Groove Tube”’
that, it seems the administra-
tidn is about to make censor-
ship an annual event. Per-
haps we shall see this done in
the form of a program held
each spring, planned by the

. Union Board. Unfortunately,
_Smith and Company | show
imagination -in-
most. things and particularly:
-jn-planning programs, so we

Shall have. only one program:
Place: Morrison. Room.
Time: Certainly before mid-

night, for most of the evil in

the «world occurs after mid-

Cast of Characters: Smith:
and Company.

.. Theme: Spencership.

So far this year, Spencer
has been slick enough to stay
out of the act. But we sus-
pect he is behind the scenes
acting as stage manager.and
prompter. ‘

It has become increasingly *
clear that censorship hap
pens all. the time as Smith
and the Union Board ‘“‘pick
and choose’’ what we are al-
lowed to see or not seé.

Furthermore, it has become
painfully clear from’ the wast-
ing of $500 on the cancella-
tion of “Groove Tube” that
C. Shaw and his Union Board
take lightly their responsiblil-
ities to administer our funds
wisely.

One example of Mr. Smith's
wasting. of money was -seen
last year when. he used mon-
ey. brought in as profit from
a jukebox in the Union to.
buy a refrigerator for his of-
fice. (After some protest,
Smith finally agreed to let
some of the other employees
of the Union: use the refrig-
erator.)

Another example is that
several_hundred-dollars were
squandered on an elaborate
stereo system for Smith's of-
fice, which he claims is nec- .
essary for the pre-viewing of
tapes sent by groups which
might perform at Davidson. .

‘We certainly must ask why
there was no preview of

“Groove Tube’ before $500
was spent.

And we must ask why it is
necessary for Shaw to have
such an expensive stereo
system for his office. Could
not he do his .previewing on
cheaper equipment?
