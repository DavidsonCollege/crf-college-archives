three starting members (Gordon, Edwin, & T.C.), the College Bowl
Team is in dire need of some superstar replacements. If you are a
freshman, sophomore or junior with the ambition of defeating North
Carolina and Duke (just like Louisville did last year) along with the dedi-
cation (practice at least twice a week) needed to accomplish these goals,
sign up in the Union lobby this week for tryouts. Tryouts will be held the
week beginning Monday, Feb. 9 with the final team selection before the
end of the term. This is a sincere plea for qualified applicants, so if you
really want to be part of an exciting team and go on lots of fun trips with
free food and lodging, make the gutty call and sign up now. Signup dead-
line is this Friday so don’t wait to sign up on the San Antonio Spur-of the
moment, sign up now!!
