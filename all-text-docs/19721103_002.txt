Davidson Bids Hattie Farewell

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

Close to 50 people. many of
them Davidson _ students.
packed Hattie’s Grill last
Friday night. Smoke and beer
fumes tilled the air. They had
come to say goodbye to Hattie
Borgorman. known to all
simply as Hattie. who sold her
grill late last week in order to
retire.

When it opened in 1944.
Hattie’s was the only business
between Davidson and Mt.
Mourne. Then as now Hattie
sold groceries. gas and beer.

**Davidson was even more out
in the country then than it is
now.’ she recalled. *‘When I
built this place there was
nothing out here but cotton
farms.”

In those days Davidson
students were not allowed to
drink beer on campus. and the
administration frowned on
drinking in general.

“IT can remember.” said
Hattie. “when bovs would be

drinking down here and a
professor would come in. the
boys would jump out the
windows or hide behind the bar
so that they wouldn't be seen.’

There was even an old law, on
the books since 1921. which
prohibited the sale of alcoholic
beverages within three miles of
Davidson.

The law had been unenforced
for years. and Hattie had never
heard of it. In 1961 a policeman
decided to enforce it. The legal
battle, financed on her behalf by
Budweiser Brewing Company,
resulted in the law being
declared unconstitutional by
the North Carolina Supreme
Court.

“Beer has always been my
biggest business.”’ said Hattie.
Presently she sells 100 cases a
week which amounts to about 90
percent of her total business.

Hattie doesn't sell very many
groceries anymore. but under
North Carolina law she must
maintain a stock of $300 in order
to sell wine.

Though nobody uses the title.

the official name of Hattie’s is
Trucker’s Inn. ‘‘When I went
down to apply for my license the
man said ‘You gotta have a
trade name.’ and since | hadn't
thought of one, I just told him to
put down Truckers Inn,”’ she
said.

“There's never been but a

dozen fights down here,"’ said

Hattie who insists that her grill
is ‘pretty quiet, except maybe
Saturday nights."

“IT can't think of any Davidson
students ever being in a fight,’
she added.

“When we have a fight I hop
in between_and try to get them
apart,” she said. “And I've
never been hit, although I can
remember one time when a
man threw a stool at me and
broke out the front window.”’

Until five or six years ago
student patronage accounted
for close to 100 percent of
Hattie’s business. In recent
years. however, that figure has
dropped to around 60 percent.

Hattie grudgingly attributes
the decrease to the availability

of beer elsewhere and the
legality of drinking it on
campus

The drop in student business
has been offset. by oa
proportional increase — in

patronage by locals. she said.

Though Hattie admittedly
does not believe in advertising.
she once sponsored a_ beer
drinking contest for Davidson
students. The winner was a
South Carolinian named *‘Hog”’
Anderson.

“The other contestents didn't
stand a chance,” said Hattie.
She recalled that ‘he drunk a
quart in two seconds.’ Hattie
said, “‘That’s got to be a
record.”

Registrar Richard Cc
Burts Jr. administered the

period for a year and a halt
This duty terminated atter the

“Ht Twas a student. the new
system would be real nice, but
there are certain problems that
must be considered.” Burts
said

“First there ts the problem
of logistics. How do you handle
that many exams”? Second,
there is the problem ot
security, he said

Bevan is presently looking for
someone to handle this new
system. Plans now are to hire
someone outside of the college
to supervise and direct the
process. It will still be the
responsibility of the SGA to find
students to provide’ the
manpower for the system.

“There is no philosophical
debate. and .no_ educational
principle involved. It is a
process of assorting. filing,
distributing, collecting and
delivering.’ Bevan said.

“It just means having all the
tests available at one place, at
each time period, for whatever
student walks in,’ said Bevan.

Bo Phillips initiated this
proposal at the student Senate
meeting on Oct. 17. After it was
passed, Phillips went to see
Bevan and Burts about the
proposed change.

Gegan Assumes Management,

Foresees No Major Changes

Larry Gegan, new owner of
Hattie’s assumed management
this week and said he plans to
make no major changes in the
immediate future.

“T feel like Hattie’s is a local
landmark", Gegan said. “I
would not want to make any
drastic changes which would
oppose the tradition — of
Hattie’s.”’

Gegan said his first’ major
actions as owner will be to “fix
the place-up. It could use a paint
job and maybe some new floor
tile.” he said. Gegan has
already reinstituted Bud-on-tap

which Hattie had discontinued
in recent years as unprofitable.

“One of my major
objectives,” said Gegan, ‘‘will
be to attract more student
business."’ Hattie’s will now
remain open to 1 a.m. on
weekends.

He also plans to sponsor
happy hours” and drinking
contests in the not too distant
future

Gegan is a native New Yorker
who has been living in Charlotte
for the past two vears. In New
York he worked as manager of
several bars and delicatessens.

SGA Hears Admissions Data

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

Admissions policies and
procedures were discussed at
length with Admissions Office
representatives as members of
the SGA Senate participated in
a question and answer period
Tuesday night.

Bill Miller. Mariam Noland
and Larry Barr responded to
issues primarily affecting
Davidson's coeducational
status and its aspects. stressing
Davidson's new diversification
of student body policy.

“The Freshman Class of men
is going to be smaller next year

so we can accommodate more

women.” Miller added.

So far this vear there have
been 34 women applications, 17
of them early decision, Miller
indicated. He hopes to have a
minimum number of 70 to 75
enrolled by next fall.

As to the question of girls on

the Exchange Program this
year who wish to transfer as
undergraduates to Davidson.
Miller made ‘it clear that they
“must have written approval
and release from their home
institution before any such
consideration can be made."

In regard to a supposed letter
sent out by the Admissions
Office discouraging would-be
women applicants due to the
limited number of coed spaces
available. Miller denied the
existence of any such thing.

Davidson's admissions policy
toward Black students was
clarified by Barr who said that
Black recruiting was a “special
interest” of his.

“Davidson isn't well
known in the Black
neighborhood, and we want to
remedy this situation,” Barr
explained.

nein aid was also raised.
as Miller responded to a charge
that the Financial Aid Office
had been denied $27,000 this

that

vear.

‘Not all of the aid budget has
been spent this year,’ replied
Miller. “‘Each year the
amount of scholarship aid is
budgeted and then goes to the
Trustees who decide the full
financial needs of deserving
students.”

Yet when asked the number
of partial or full scholarship
football players at Davidson,
Miller estimated the number to
be ‘around 80°’, and the total
football-basketball scholarship
expenditure for last year at
roughly 236,300.

The most significant action
by the SGA for that night was:a
mandate from the Senate to the
ad hoc SGA _ Investigating
Committee to research the
olfice of the Registrar, due to
the “number of students (who)
have met with undue difficulty
and discouragement” with that
department.
