DEATH OF PROMINENT
WILMINGTON PASTOR

Comes as Shock to Many Friends.
Dr. A. D. McClure Unexpectedly
Stricken—Student Body Extends
Sympathy to His Family.

It was with a very keen regret
that the people of North Carolina
learned of the death of Rev. A. D.
McClure, D.D. This was especially
true of the student body here, for
Dr. McClure was the father of R.
E. McClure, '20.

Dr. McClure was pastor of the St.
Andrews Presbyterian Church, of

Wilmington, having served it de-,

votedly since 1891. His work as
chairman of the Associated Chari-
ties of Wilmington for the past 20
years is but one example of the
many charitable activities of a life
devoted to serving God by the uplift
of his fellow man.

Dr. McClure was well known and
much loved throughout the - state.
At the time of his death he was re-
turning from holding a meeting at
Mt. Olive, N.C. He had seemed in
perfect health a short time before
his death. ;

Resolutions of sympathy were
drawn up by his fellow pastors in
Wilmington expressive of the regret
that the city feels in the loss of one
who so ably and so faithfully gave
himself to the service of every cause
for the spiritual betterment of his
fellow citizens.

Among the alumni that attended
the State College-Davidson baseball
game last Saturday were: Dr. J. P.
Monroe, Charlotte; R. 8. Cunning-
ham, °19, Winnsboro, S. C.; Jno. L.
Payne, '16, Washington, N. C,; Em-
ery Flinn, 19, Atlanta, Ga.; Ted
Cashion, °16, Gastonia: Dave Hall,
19, Belmont; “Pete” Perry. Char-
lotte.

Dr. John Whitehead, ‘75, has been
ill for a week or more at his home
in Salisbury, and his condition is
such as to cause grave concern. Dr.
Whitehead is the head of the White-
head-Stokes Sanatorium, and has
been one of the leading physicians of.
the state for a number of years. He
has been prominent in all councils
pertaining to his profession, and no
one has been more influential in
preserving the hest methods in the
profession.

Mr. George E. Wilson, ’67, and for
many years attorney for the Board
of Trustees of the College, has been
sick at his home in Charlotte for
several weeks.

Mr. Edward Spratt, the father of
F. R. Spratt, ex-’20 (now living in
Akron, O.), was killed in au auto-
mobile collision in Charlotte last
week. The father of John Wilson
McNair, ex-’22, was killed in a like
accident early in January.

Rev. J. A. McQueen, '05, has mov-
ed from Dillon to Hamer, S. C.

J. W. O'Connell, ex-’15, has been
since his discharge from the service
in March, 1919, recuperating at
Asheville, N. C. He was disabled in
service, and after his discharge con-
ditions resulted which have made
six months’ hospital treatment nec-
essary, but he is now recovering.

Frank H. Baker, ’17, is with the
Robert Packer Hospital, Sayre, Pa.

J. F. Nash, ’11, is practicing medi-
cine at St. Pauls, S. C.

Joel M. Cloud, ex-'16, is with Fur-
ness, Withy and Company, Limited,
Baltimore, large steamship owners
and operators.

MRS. GEORGE McRAE ROBSON

Has Rendered Noble Service to Col-
lege—Popular Matron of the In-
Has Served Davidson for

Twelve Years.

Mrs. A. B. Robson was born, Alice

She received her college!

lege, Abingdon, Va., and there was
awarded the A.B. degree. Her

|ietreat fo for nursing was made at

Retreat for the Sick, Norfolk. Va.
Here she met Dr. George M. Rob-
son, to whom she was married in
1897. In 1901 Dr. Robson died,
leaving to the care of their
mother the two young boys, George
and Charles Robson. During the
years 1902-1906 Mrs. Robson was in
charge of the infirmary at Pantops
Academy, Charlottesville, Va. After
spending some time at home with
her mother and in doing private
nursing, Mrs. Robson came in 1908
to Davidson to give her sons their
college education. Since this date
she has been in charge of the college
infirmary, where she has done valu-
able and faithful service to the insti-
tution.

During these years Mrs. Robson
has been one of the truest of those
who have served Davidson. The
few, days that she has missed from
this term are the only ones that
have found her absent from her post
of duty. Those for whom she has
cared, alone, can tell with how great
an interest and concern she looks
upon every man of the student body.
The college as well as cach one of
the students owes to her a debt of-
gratitude which cannot easily be
discharged.

erpool. The battery was then taken |

to Langress, France, via Le Harve,'™

for training in the French Mortar
School. After two months at
Langress they spent three months.
at Vitrey, taking practice fire as re-
serves. The men went into action’
in the St. Mihiel ‘sector in the latter
part of September, remaining there i
until the armistice was signed. The
battery was attached at times to the
Fifth and at times to the Seventh!
divisions. The homeward trip was!
begun in March, 1919, and the outfit :
landed at Hoboken about the middle
of the month. The men were then
sent to Camp Lee via Camp Upton,
the majority being discharged about !
the Ist of April. Having made a,
success of army life, Justus decided |
to try that of the student, and ac-
cordingly entered Davidson College
