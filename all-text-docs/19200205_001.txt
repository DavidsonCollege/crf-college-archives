Seniors Practicing Diligently.

Under the coaching of Douglas.
that brilliant and scintillating star of
last season, the Senior team is going
to wend its way to victury.

The material is fine. At one end
we find Doc McConnell, the baseball
wonder, and at the other end we find
Vanderville Cathey. The two tackles
are Basketball Richards and Presi-
dent Sutton. The latter is suffering
the effects of a slight operation, but
will be more than ready when the
first game comes. Commissary
Matthews and Trombone Harrell
are the hefty guards. They have
both played before and are the
strength of the line. The centrol
position is held by Hunter, the noted
mathematics scholar, His playing
reminds one of Day. of Georgia.

The quartet in the backfield is
heavy and fast. Friend Wilson is:
generaling the team. One has but to
shut his eyes and can easily imagine
that it is Henry Spann handling the!
hall. Pee Wee Ratchford and Strup-:
per Tavlor are running halves. Their
end runs and line plunges are won-
derful. Last but not least we come ,
to the far-famed fullback, Railroad
Craig.

A fine bunch of scrubs are out. ,
Among them we find Sanders, the}
second Jim Thorpe: Stogner, who
has the build of Willard and the
punch of Dempsey: Thomas, whose
writings in Physics are standard.

With such a coach and the fine
material he has to work with, the

Seniors expect to take the class
championship.

That the Polity Club is a most ex-

tion, All the members are especially
enthused over it now because of the
bright prospects for the future. Not-
withstanding the pouring rain, nine
faithful members were present at
the last meeting Tuesday night, and
they were by no means poorly re-
warded, Dr. Lingle was the chief
speaker, giving a most interesting
account of his attendance upon the
convention of Polity Club faculty

‘members from different institutions

of the country. held in Cleveland, 0.,
December 30. At this convention

one is interested was the probable
establishment of a series of prizes
for work done in’ the clubs. But

A BIG FACTOR IN ROLSING “PER”

portant Organization
Campus

Fills a Long-Desired Need — Much
Credit Due Freeman and Dunn

For years it was thought an im-
possibility to organize permanently
a regular brass band at Davidson.
All of us knew that Davidson had
her full share of musical talent: yet
no one cared to shoulder the respon-
sibility of attempting to organize
this talent into the much-needed
band.

However, when Col. A. H. Mueller
came to Davidson as head of the R.
O. T. C.. he immediately saw the
need of a good band, and he took the
initiative in making it a reality. He
was thoroughly supported by ‘the
student body, and the result is that
Davidson today has one of the best
college bands in the South. In con-
sideration of the large R. O. T. C.
enrollment, together with Colonel
Mueller’s unceasing efforts, the Gov-
ernment was induced to furnish the
instruments, thus releasing for other
equipment the money which the stu-
dents had previously raised.

Although the band is primarily a
part of the R. O. T. C., yet its ac-
tivities have by no means been ex-
clusively military. Jt has been a
potent factor of every “pep” meet-
ing on the hill, and the weekly con-
certs at the picture show have heen
greatly appreciated by the whole
student body. And beside local ac-
tivities, the Davidson Band has be-
come famous for the hig parades in
Charlotte and Winston, and the con-
cert it gave in the city of Rock Hill
on last Thanksgiving day.

Much credit is due to Lieut. D. R.
Freeman for his expert services as

in each individual member, and he
has succeeded well. From the stand-

Half of These to Be on the Hill—Two
Trips Through the South

Manager Foscue. has just. com-
pleted the best baseball schedule
this college has seen for several
years, After glancing over this
program the largest crowd of can-
didates ever known to Sprunt field
will be hunting up the spiked shoes
and high school uniform for a try at
the select nine. A little less than a
month now and Coach Hengeveld
will be issuing the first call. for prac-
tice.

The schedule includes 17 colleg-
iate games, about half of which can
he seen by the local fans. “The trips
are very fittingly arranged so that
only five games are played on one
trip instead of a long 10-day ordeal
which was passed through — last
year. One very attractive feature
is the final three-game trip to Green-
ville and Atlanta. The University
of North Carolina will be played on
Sprunt fiield, the biggest game of
the year on the local diamond. The
State College will be played in
Charlotte, which will give all a good

excuse for taking a trip, and also,

give the band a chance to display
their progress.

and see what you think of it:

March 24 and 25—Oak Ridge, at
Davidson.

April 2—Wofford, at Davidson.

April 5—Univ. of N.C. at David-

Team Plays in Hard Luck
on Six Day Trip

Good Form Displayed in Most Games—
Dropped Game to Carolina
by One Point

N. C. State Game.

The Wildcats dropped the second
game of the Carolina trip to the
heavy N.C. State quint by the score
of 30 to 10. The Tech lads were
just toa tall and heavy for the light-
ct Davidson outfit, and as the sec-
vnd half drew near a close, this
handicap began to have its effect’
and the game became one-sided.

The first half was a toss up. with -
the Wildcats fighting hard, but
missing casy shots at the basket.
The sudden change from the small-
er Guilford court of the previous
night to the auditorium floor in Ral-
cigh, caused many of Roberts’ and
Halls shots ao fall short of the has-
ket. No one scored during the first
few minutes, until Roberts scored a
foul yoal From then on it was nip
and tuck and the half ended 10 to 9,
in N.C. State’s favor.

After the first few minutes of. the
second half, Ripple, of A. & EL, got
loose and scored an easy shot. The
Red and Black aggregation could
not stop the onslaught and substi-
tutes were sent in at this point of
the play. Romefelt replaced Stric-
beck at center; Crawford took, Rob-
erts’ forward position, and Shepherd
plased Brice's puaid position. N. c.
State continued its fight unheaded.
and the game ended 30 to 10, Da-
vidson being unable to locate the
basket for a single field score.

Ripple led the scoring with seven
field goals to his credit. Deal. pis
partner, scored three goals, Rob-
erts led in the Red and Black scor-
ing. making eight of the 10 points
scored. ;

Wake Forest Game.

Putting up the poorest exhibition
of basketball on the whole trip, Da-
vidson lost to Wake Forest by a 24
to 12 score. The play was slow
throughout, due partially to the
poor refereeing, and neither team
showed a burst of speed until the’
last five minutes, when Davidson
staged a weak rally.

The first half opened up with the
home team passing rings around the
visitors but not locating the basket
frequently. After the first few min-
utes the Presbyterians settled down
and played a good defensive game.
but were unable to make any prog-
ress against the Kaptist’s guarding.
Romefelt made the only field goal
scored by the Wildcats the first half,
while Roberts tossed in three free
shots. Meanwhile by continual
plugging. Wake Forest scored four
field goals and three fouls. The
half ended 11 to 5 in the home team's
favor.

The second half opened up with a
