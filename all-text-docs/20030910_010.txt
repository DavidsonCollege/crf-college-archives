Men’s hoops opponents include nation’s elite programs
Duke, UNC, Georgetown, Seton Hall highlight this year’s slate

By Marr GARFIELD

Practice doesn’t start for another five weeks,
and the season’s first game is still more than two
months away.

But take a quick look at the men’s basketball
schedule, and it’s already clear the Wildcats’
2003-04 campaign has a chance to be special.

Davidson will face several of the most storied
programs in college basketball in what Matt
Matheny says might be the toughest non-confer-
ence schedule for any mid-major team in the
country.

“I think it’s by far one of the toughest,” said
Matheny, who was given the title of associate
head coach during the off-season. “We just want
to give ourselves an opportunity to make a splash
on the national scene.”

A quick rundown of the highlights:

-The team travels to Texas Tech to take on
Bobby Knight and the Red Raiders in the Pre-
season NIT on Nov. 18. The game will be tele-
vised nationally on ESPN. Knight’s notorious
temper got him fired from Indiana two seasons
ago, but the man known as “The General” has
won three national titles in 30 years as a coach.

-The Wildcats return home for their second
game to face North Carolina on Nov. 24 at the
Charlotte Coliseum in a contest that could, break
the Davidson “home” attendance record of 11,666
set two years ago against Duke.

It'll be Roy Williams’ second game as coach of
the Tar Heels, and his first in Charlotte, acity with
thousands of UNC alumni.

Matheny says it’s not clear whether the North
Carolina series will extend beyond this season.

But Williams has already hinted that he’s
reluctant to play in-state opponents, similar
to his mentor, former Tar Heels coach
Dean Smith.

-Four games later, Davidson will travel
to the MCI Center in Washington, DC to
play Georgetown,
a once-proud Big
East program that
suffered numerous
defections over the
off-season. This
might be the Wild-
cats’ best chance
for an attention-
grabbing non-con-
ference win.

-Another trip
north just before’ Christmas will take
Davidson to the 24,000-seat Meadowlands,
officially known as Continental Airlines
Arena, where the team will face Seton Hall.

Both Georgetown and Seton Hall will
visit Belk Arena next year to complete the
two “home-and-home” series.

-One week later, the Wildcats travel to
Cameron Indoor Stadium to play Duke ina
rematch of last year’s closer-than-expected
95-80 Blue Devils victory.

Oddly enough, the game is at 4 p.m. ona
Monday afternoon to accommodate the
ESPN broadcast.

The schedule is ambitious, but Matheny
says the Wildcats’ roster—a combination
of experienced returnees and talented new-
comers—is as deep as any he can recall at
Davidson.

Booker

A trio of sophomores—Brendan Winters,
Ian Johnson and Matt McKillop—got heavy
playing time last season and should be even
better this year, said Matheny.

But the key to the season might be the play
of three others who didn’t play at all last
season.

-Logan Kosmalski, a6-8 forward who trans-
ferred from Baylor and is a possible all-con-
ference candidate.

-Kenny Grant, a point guard who trans-
ferred from Lafayette who might draw com-
parisons to the. dependable, if not flashy,
Davidson point guards of the past.

-Nick Booker, an athletic 6-7 wingman who
sat out last year to concentrate 6n academics.
Booker was a key contributor in the team’s run
to the NCAA Tournament two seasons ago.

“Versatility has been a key to our really
good teams. I think we’re pretty versatile this
year,” said Matheny.

“It’s an experienced group of players. I
think we’ll be as deep as we’ ve ever been. It’s
going to be achallenge to see how quickly the
guys can gel.

The schedule doesn’t allow for much breath-
ing room, so they need to gel quickly.”

Following the non-conference season, the
Wildcats will open play as a member of the re-
aligned South Division of the Southern Con-
ference, joining Charleston, Furman, Wofford,
The Citadel and Georgia Southern.

They’ ll attempt to erase the bitter memory
of last year’s shocking season-ending 66-60
tournament loss to VMI, a team the Wildcats
had beaten by 35 points less than a week
earlier.
