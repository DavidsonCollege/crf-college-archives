~ “My, my," some of you are
saying, “perhaps Mr. Hill should
take up residence at an undisclosed
address. Better still, perhaps he
should resign from the college.”
For, assuredly, those who identify
themselves with the politically cor-
rect movement are already honing
theirswords. But before we bloody
ourselves between the pages of
The Davidsonian, let us first ex-
amine the underpinnings of the
P.C. movement.

First, the politically correct in-
tend to protect minorities and the
handicapped from language which
would damage their self esteem
and which perpetuates senseless
prejudices.

Second, P.C. philosophy em-
braces the subjective, asserting that
all value systems should be equally
respected as expressions of sub-
jective truth. In other words, while
world-views and philosophical sys-
tems may differ, none should be
judged as inferior to the rest.

Final, and most important,
P.C. advocates call on private and
public institutions to enforce these
principles through laws and regu-
lations.

Unfortunately, in pursuing
such regulations, the politically
correct ignore a fundamental tenet
of societal organization. Namely,
to conquer the chaos of natural
law, a civilization must be willing
and able to restrain individual free-
dom wherever it infringes inap-
propriately on the freedom and
rights of others.

Already, then, most societies
must condemn those value sys-
tems which honor homicide, theft,
or unprovoked violence as normal
and acceptable behaviors.

Nonetheless, by extrapolation,
P.C. dogma must defend the legiti-
macy of violent subcultures and
their corresponding belief systems.
For while their moral codes devi-
ate from the societal norm, their

Thnuststart outthis week by apolo-
gizing to my fellow reverends in
the Universal Life Church.

I did not mean to imply that I
was the only one who can marry
you oncampus. I have been struck
with a missionary zeal and have
been ordaining people whenever I
get the chance. There are several
men of the cloth (no women yet)
wandering around thiscampus with
the light of the world burning bright
in their chests.

So, if you are struck with the
desire to get married and I am

help you. Now on to my article:

Like most of the world, I have
been keeping an eye on the Winter
Olympics. I don’t claim to be a
particularly bright or observant
person, but some of the sports that
are being televised just don’t make
much sense to me.

Take the luge, for example..

How does one go about becoming
a luger? Does the USOC send
scouts out to the hills of Colorado
looking for exceptionally fast
sledders? “Look at that one,
' Charlie. He’s already steering with
his feet. We can skip that part of
his training altogether. I think we
have a prodigy on our hands here!”
I also think that whoever
picks the lugers of the world goes
about it entirely the wrong way. If
I were in charge of picking lugers,
my team would consist of the fat-
test men on the planet. I might
even hire Richard Simmons to do
my scouting.
The whole goal is to go fast,
right? Anybody who has taken a
‘physics class can tell you heavy
things slide down a hill faster than
light things. (Don’task me, though.
I don’t know physics from
phenylketonuria.)

I also could never picture
myself going to any of those speed
events to watch it live. I couldn’t
imagine anything more boring than
standing around, waiting for a blur
of color to come flashing by at
eighty miles an hour. There is no
way anyone can convince me that
they can see anything.

At best you may be able to
identify the primary color of the
uniform, which each country
makes sure has absolutely nothing
to do with its national colors. I just
don’t understand what the spider
webs all over the US Ski Team
have to do with this country. Maybe
their dorm has flies.

The biathlon is a sport that
completely baffles me. I tried one
day to map the development of
athlons from bi to tri to dec. Don’t
waste your time. The only connec-
tion I could come up with is that
people who compete in these events
have way too much time on their
hands and most of them can beat
me up. But whoever made the
connection between cross country
skiing and shooting a gun must
have been from some other coun-
try.
Everyone in America knows
that the most natural thing to com-
bine with guns is alcohol. I wish
that an ingenious Southerner came
up with the biathlon. Now, that
would be a sport worth watching.
The competitors would have to
finish a case of beer and then shoot
things. The bigger and more dan-
gerous something is, the more
points it’s worth. Soon the en-
trants would turn the guns on each
other and we’d have a blood bath.
I guess I can see why the Olympics
would turn that one down, but it
would be a great way to get rid of
some rednecks.

very existence supposedly de-
mands our respect as a dissimilar,
but equally valid system of values.
In other words, the
movement’s emphasis on the sub-
jective necessarily erodes its li-
cense to convict and censure even
the most moronic and contemptu-
ous of views. To explain, gangs,
drug cartels, terrorists, the KKK,
and serial killers can all justify
their actions within their belief
systems, many of which prove re-
markably sophisticated.
Obviously, the politically cor-
rect do not intend their theory to
apply to these systems, whose very
expression causes physical harm
to others. But to preserve consis-
tency across its doctrine, the politi-
cally correct cannot condemn such
groups or individuals. —
Ironically, then, if we extend
P.C, philosophy universally, it
eventually must recognize and re-
spect those prejudiced and mali-

cious views which it originally
sought to eradicate.

In sum, the politically correct
do not present a sound philosophi-
cal foundation from which they
can attack those who continue to
offend and persecute the less pow-
erful members of society.

How, then, can such preju-
dices be progressively eliminated
from society? I believe we must
copy the methods evinced through-
out human history—through
proper legal sanctions and ada-
mant social denunciation.

Inthe case of the United States,
we have already seen that institu-
tional discipline against speech
directly violates our Constitution.
To my knowledge, not a single
court has upheld private policies
which warrant punishment or ex-
pulsion for verbal or written in-
sults and statements. Apparently,
then, we are left only with the latter
alternative.

ish a significant amount of the
prejudice lingering in our society.
Instead of castigating from afar, as
the politically correct now pro-
pose, I would rather see a one-on-
one confrontation with ourselves,
our friends and our acquaintances.
If we assume the risks implied
in philosophical conviction, and if
we can overcome our inhibition to
express disapproval, we will al-
ready begin to extinguish those
behaviors which we secretly judge
as offensive and inappropriate.
But until we abandon the ten-
tative, subjective views of the P.C.
movement, we cannot accomplish
their goals. Until we have the
courage to assert that some value
systems are inherently superior we
cannot eradicate opposing philoso-
phies which violate the rights of
others. And ultimately, inappro-
priate language as a symptom may
diminish as the greater problem of
prejudice is addressed in a con-
frontational, individual context.

Man, this place sucks. All this talk
about Christianity as the basis fora

Those holier-than-thou “Christian”
trustees just don’t know where to
get off! What we need around here
is some inclusiveness--nothing tied
to a specific tradition, just things
like a call for justice, for diversity,
based on objective principles we
can all agree on. If this place needs
anything, it needs change.

Okay, so I’ve presented cari-
catures of two polar positions, and
I admit they’re unfair. But it kept
you reading this far into an article
about what I think is basically an
identity crisis at this college. Since
its beginnings, Davidson has been
Presbyterian-related, but as our so-
ciety becomes multicultural and
pluralistic, we’re being forced to
ask ourselves whether it makes
sense to base our self-understand-
ing on such a specific tradition.

Instead of celebrating our heri-
tage, I want to reflect on institu-
tional identity in our postmodern
intellectual climate. Unless folks
have had their heads in the sand for
a decade, they recognize we can’t
have an “objective” perspective on
ourselves and our world (and that
applies in both the humanities and
the sciences). We all bring catego-
ries and assumptions—in a sense,

where we want to be headed as a
college.

- I’m convinced the Christian
tradition gives us a terrific per-
spective from which to see our
identity. I can already hear the
objections about Christianity be-
ing narrow because of its truth
claims about things like the iden-°
tity of Jesus.

For example, isn’t one inher-
ently prejudiced against members
of other religions if one is a Chris-
tian? [would emphatically answer
no. One may not agree with the
truth claims those religions make,
but disagreement isn’t the same as
narrowness or prejudice. You can
believe something passionately and
still respect the dignity of others
who believe differently, and even
encourage them to voice their per-
spectives. In fact, it’s precisely
when we express our positions with
integrity, humility, and charity that
the most significant interaction and
education—and not just ideologi-
cal shouting matches—can take
place.

That fact is one of the reasons
that Davidson would be poorer ifit
cut its ties with the Christian tradi-
tion. The values that I have just
named don’t come out of thin air;
