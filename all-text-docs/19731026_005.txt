Plunkett Denounces Davidson Norms

Bs TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

Professor Hugh Plunkett will
not be teaching at Davidson
next year. At the beginning of
this academic year he received
word from Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan that his contract would
not be renewed.

“I've been here under rather
specialized circumstances,
anyway,” Plunkett told THE
DAVIDSONIAN in an interview
Tuesday.

‘I was hired as sort of a wild
card with no real attachment to
any of the standard depart-
ments at Davidson. I teach
lower-level sociology courses,
but my other courses are listed
under South Asian studies.

‘“‘We never really have
developed the integration that
we needed with other depart-
ments. Of course, many
philosophy, economics,
religion, and art, did cross-list
our courses and their faculty
teach in the South Asian
program.”’

Plunkett said that some
faculty members were not en-
thusiastic about the program,
however.

Even more critically, some
students were hesitant to take
the untried South Asian of-
ferings.

“Students at Davidson seem

very suspicious of the
unknown,’’ Plunkett stated.
‘They tend to be grade-
«conscious,’’ he added.
‘They tend to be more con-
cerned about attracting
favorable attention from
graduate schools.

“They are not geared for ex-
periences that do not conform
to the Davidson norms.

“The Davidson norm, in this
case, consists of sitting in a
classroom absorbing the
knowledge that the professor
thinks you need to learn.”’

Speculating that learning
Davidson-style might not be the
most efficient or economical
way to get an education,
Plunkett said that he had been
to other schools where in-

dependent research wa
stressed more successfully.

“We wanted people not only
to know about South Asia, but
also to feel about it. In this
respect, the Davidson culture
was just not receptive. It may
be that students have forgotten
how to carry on a dynamic
discussion, or maybe they just
want to be private."

“The faculty here is really
good and they work really hard.
The students work terribly
hard; that one’s studies will be
a grind is part of the cultural ex-
pectation at Davidson."

Davidson is, in Plunkett's
view, a poor place to be an out-
sider. ‘‘There is an elaborate
pecking order at Davidson, part
of it based on the same criteria
we find in primitive societies.

“It is helpful to have
graduated from Davidson, or to
have relatives who taught here.
There is a large number of
professors who are members of
inbred clans that cross back
and forth over the years.” Sixty
percent of the faculty at David-
son has tenure as opposed to 48
percent nation-wide, this makes
relatively conservative
academic situation.”’

Plunkett said that the debate
over religious restrictions on
tenure had depressed him last
spring.

“The implicit question in this

debate is ‘Are we professionals
or are we employees?’ I think
we got a pretty definite answer
from the trustees: we're em-
ployees.

“If we are employers, we
ought to act like it and drop the
pretense of being independent
professionals. ”

Plunkett said that Davidson is
both content and frustrated.

“The trustee form of govern-
ment is very predictable, if
nothing else. A trustee is a nice
man who has power and can say
what he wants to. Often he
says, ‘‘Don’t rock the boat.’ *’

Plunkett stated that he
thought Davidson should devel-

op to a clear form of faculty
evaluation_‘‘We need to know

the goals for our teaching. What
kinds of things do we encourage
students to learn and are these
the most valuable things they
should learn?

“There are a number of
teachers here who are
acknowledged to be excellent
by both faculty and students.
We ought to film their classes.”’

Plunkett said that it was un-
fortunate that more explicit
discussion of teaching methods
is not a part of faculty (and
student) life.

Plunkett hopes to return to
anthropological work through a
foundation grant, and curtail
his work in teaching.

‘A Midsummer Night’sDream’ Highlights

1973-74 College Drama SeasonOpening

By FRAZIER MARSH
Staff Writer

The Davidson Drama Depart-
ment will begin its 1973-74
season next Wednesday with
the student opening of William
Shakespeare's ‘‘A Midsummer-
Night’s Dream"’ at 8:15 p.m. in
Hodson Hall.

The play is centered around
the capriciousness and
changability of lovers.

Shakespeare presents a group
of lovers so irresponsible in
their actions that their freakish

behavior can be explained only
by the intervention of super-
natural beings, who seem to

turn order into chaos.

The play is one of
Shakespeare’s most delightful
and popular comedies.

Director Rupert T. Barber is
very excited over the produc-
tion.

“It was necessary to con-

.struct an entire stage for this

production,’’ he said.

“Mike Ramsey and I have
spent many hours trying to
design a set which would be
suitable to our unique tastes.

“It took three designs before
we were fully satisfied. The

final set is terrific’ “" he ad-
mitted.
In the past, Barber has

produced Shakesperean plays
in a more conventional manner.

When asked if the production
would be presented in the
Elizabethan style, Barber said,
“Although the plays of
Shakespeare are Elizabethan in
character, this does not mean
that they are restricted to that
time period only.

“A Midsummer’ Night's
Dream’’ may be _ produced
within any time period. It has
a timeless quality about it. The
play is just as relevant to the
20th centivy as it is to the 16th
century.

“IT feel

that keeping

Shakespeare withinhisowntime

period can at times hinder a

production
“The

timelessness of

Barber explained.

Scott Reid who plays Snout
the tinker, one of Shakespeare's
rustics, said ‘‘When I was cast
in the play I was rather hesitant
about the part. I could just see
myself sitting down weeks
ahead of time trying to get my
‘thees’ and ‘thous’ in their right
places.

‘‘I must admit that I was very
surprised to see how easy the
language is to learn and even to
remember.

Valerie Grey, one of the
fairies, remarked, ‘‘Doing
Shakespeare like this is really a
delight. There is never a dull
moment. Someone is either
being chased, transformed or
playing tricks on someone
throughout the whole play.

“The only thing I regret is
that I will be on stage and will
not be able to sit in the audience
and really enjoy the show,’’ she
remarked.

‘Nancy Moncure, the resident

music co-ordinator and
choreographer, also enjoys
working with the play.

“It is the kind of play that
will be a great success,’’ she
said.

‘“‘All of the cast has put in
countless hours on rehearsals.
They are a dedicated group of
people that want to have a good
show for the college.”

‘‘A Midsummer Night’s
Dream” will be presented next
week running from Wednesday
to Saturday Oct. 31 - Nov. 3. The
play will begin at 8:15 p.m.
