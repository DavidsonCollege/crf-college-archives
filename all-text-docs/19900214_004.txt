MORE VP HOPEFULS, from page 3

million dollar Davidson Campaign, we
will not have to wait until we are old
and gray to feel the benefits. AsanSGA
Vice President candidate, and most
importantly, as a Davidson student, I
encourage you, my peers, to boldly try

and chipaway at the barriers of culture,
race, and socioeconomics today, and
become an involved member of the
unified Davidson family. You will be
helping yourself and your home away
from home. —

I, Jason Brannon, promise to work to-
gether with the President in providing
an example for you to follow.

Kristi Kessler

One of the main objectives of the SGA
is to provide a vital link between the
students and the administration, to
provide a channel through which stu-
dents’ voices can be expressed and
heard. The office of vice president plays
an extremely important role in achiev-
ing these goals. The vice president must
enjoy being an organizer. This person is
in charge of organizing and recruiting
leadership for the various SGA commit-
tees such as publicity, SGA rides and
other committees that provide vital
services to the student body. The vice
president also helps to coordinate the
selection of students to serve on the
faculty committees, an opportunity for
students to have input in many areas of
campus life. The vice president must
work closely with the president to
guide and direct the Senate as it ex-
plores all areas of campus life.

Asa member of the Senate for the past
twoyears, I, Kristi Kessler, have come to
see the influence the student voice can
have. I have worked closely during the
past two years on issues such as better
campus security, athletics, semesters
and many other issues pertinent to stu-
dent life at Davidson. I have come to

understand how the SGA can provide
vital student representation.

My participation on the Senate has
helped to.strengthen my leadership
qualities, as have many other areas of
involvement. for the past three years I
have worked closely with the SGA and
the Admissions Office to plan and exe-
cute SGA Weekend, a weekend for
prospective students that takes place
each spring. This has involved much
behind the scenes planning and organ-
izing. This year I have worked closely
with the Admissions Office to develop
the Davidson Ambassadors Program, a

_ program that coordinates all student

volunteers in the Admissions Office.
My experience as a hall counselor has
helped me to develop valuable skills of
communication and interaction with
other people.

I have decided to run for the position
of SGA Vice President because I would
like to help continue the strong tradi-
tion of the SGA for giving the student’
body a voice, for fostering the strong
link between the students and the col-
lege. My experience on the Senate has
shown me what the job of vice president
entails and I would like to be given the
opportunity to fill this position in an
attempt to make the Davidson Experi-
ence the best it can be.

The time I have spentas an Independ-
ent Senator on the SGA has made me
aware of the responsibility and the
commitment the office of the Vice Presi-

dent entails.

The position is one that involves
much legwork and a steady flow of
backup and input that accelerates the
wheels within the SGA. I suppose the
best analogy would be that of the lieu-
tenant in charge of the assault on some

isolated hill in the middle of nowhere:
it’s his job; the general in his command
tent gets the credit for his tactics. I feel
that I am adequately equipped to
handle that responsibility and commit-
ment.

I suppose I could be accused of ambi-
tion. What, you might well ask, is a
sophomore doing running for an SGA
office? However, I am quite convinced
that the exposure Ive had on this cam-
pus already, has more than prepared
me for the challenge. Indeed, there’s no
denying the fact that the position is a
challenge; a challenge that as a rising
junior, I ought to be wary of. But, the
nature of the office is such that it is
almost as though it is specifically de-
signed to instill in the individual a deep
rooted sense of quiet satisfaction and
contentment with a job well done.

Wednesday, February 14, 1990 THE DAVIDSONIAN

I will bring to the office a distinct
perspective and a diversity that would
best reflect the hopes and the aspira-
tions of a Student body that shows in-
creasing diversity with each passing
year. As a rising junior, I guess I am
critically placed: I’ve been here long
enough toknow how thesystem works;
but I haven’t been here so long that I’ve
forgotten what it is to be an underclass-
men. And more importantly, I will
bring to the office an enthusiasm and a
sense of purpose that can only help the
SGA’s efforts to be a truly representa-
tive body.

At this point of time, it would be easy
to make glowing promises and_ elo-
quent statements of purpose. But, talk’s
cheap—paper tigers tend to deflate and
burstall tooeasily. I would muchrather
my actions speak for myself.

Linsey Mills

My name is Linsey R. Millsand lama
rising junior. I have decided to run for
the office of Vice President of the SGA
because, I, like many other students, am
concerned about the future of Davidson
College. Although Davidson College is
one that was built upon tradition and
has gained national recognition be-
cause ofits traditionally strong academ-
ics, there are various facets of our col-
lege community that could benefit
through changes that would bring
about progress. These changes would
allow us to compete with those other
Ivy-League schools who have seen that
change will not only benefit the college
butalso the community which supports
it as well.

My qualinations speak for them-
selves. | have been involved notonlyon
various campus committees but also in
community enrichment programs in-
volving the area schools. Specifically,
some of these are the Minorities Affairs
Committee, an advisory committee to
the President; Director of the Davidson

Elementary Tutoring Program, an after
school tutoring program for all students
ages six through twelve; Big Brother/
Big Sister community program, a pro-
gram designed to provide a child of the
community with a positive role model;
Counselor-Mentor for the Love of
Learning Program, which inspires
young African-American students and
helps them build self-esteem. Cur-
rently, I hold the office of the Vice-Presi-
dent of the BSC.

Because of my involvement in differ-
entareas of the college, lam sensitive to
the needs and concerns of various
groups on campus. Changes in the
Athletic department, the Security De-
partment, Minority affairs, Women’s
affairs and in our curriculum are just a
few areas that I am aware of and am
willing to work toward improving. My
concerns are not just‘ for myselfor for
any one group on campus, but for the
student body as a whole. I’m striving
toward creating an environment con-
ducive to all students. I am looking for-
ward to serving as your next Vice Presi-
dent of the SGA.
