A PLEDGE

* With the beginning of a new
regime in the publishing of this
sheet comes new realization of
the vital importance of a real stu-
dent body organization for ex-
pression of campus sentiment.
The college newspaper of today
has passed the stage of novelty.
It is no longer a feeble attempt
to copy the style of a big city
daily, or a mere institution to
serve as a base for the infrequent
journalistic dabbles of, undergrad-
uates. Throughout the nation,
the college news sheet stands for
the heart of college spirit, for the
pulse beat of the men and women
who walk the paths of the cam-
pus, who dash upon the cinder
tracks, who sit in
houses, and who add their names
to the catalogue as recruits in the
legions of Wisdom, The paper is
today recognized as the center of
all endeavor, and it is a center
of all endeavor, and it is a center
which, like a spider’s web, ex-
tends threads to each nook and
corner of the field. It is as big
as the spirit of the student body—
its future is limited only by the

reach of the school’s vision.
What a task to fulfill the ideal
of the collegiate press! How to
incorporate into the lifeless pages
a burning, stirring
which will bring the heart’s blood
of the place to the front—how to
imbue the columns of material
with all of the bravery, happiness,
beauty, ambition and faith of a
great band of men—how to write
DAVIDSON
HOOD between the lines—these
are vital demands which face the

. Staff of your paper.

_May the inspiration of the ideal
spur every-worker on to splendid
effort, may the best become bet-

fraternity:

something

and BROTHER-

tion, but the intent is serious, and
unless we are far off our base,

‘l!may be applied to a good number

of Davidsonians. It is a question
whether or not the paper receives
the attention in any department
which. it deserves. So often a
hurried glance at the headlines,
or a brief run through a more
popular section is about all that
the weekly issue means to some.
Every day the same thing hap-
pens when we pick up the daily
news sheet. First a turn to the
sports page to see how many‘
hits Ruth and Gehrig chalked up,
then several minutes with Dyna-
mite Dunn and Joe Jenks—may-
be if there is nothing else push-
ing we find whether the Mexi-
cans have stopped scrapping. The
other columns, feature and edi-

torial, miss fire with us. Of
course, not all readers are of this
fragmentary nature, but too

many are, and under such condi-
tions, the paper fails to Serve its
purpose.

There is always the condemna-
tion of a college publication that
its contents lack real merit, and
that it is not worthy of too much
time. The campus sheet will be
made better as it gains the at-
tention of its readers, and as they
begin to lend their talents to its
perfection. Made-up by students,
managed by. students, the paper
is always doing its level best to
create worthwhile things for the
college and for students. Such
effort will not be in vain if the
proper spirit of sympathy and
mutual aid is maintained in the
ranks of readers. Be familiar
with every part of your paper,
take the time to see if it is meas-
uring up to school traditions and
progress. Show your colors by
reading it through. The labor and
ambition of the staff calls for that
at least.

ABOUT THIS TIME

There always comes a time
when fellows begin to murmur
about the beauties of the campus,
about how pretty a full moon
would be, about how ni€e it is to
loll around on the benches fin
front of the dormitories, about
baseball, about coming vacation
trips—about Spring! Something
good for everybody in the spring-
time—anybody who wants it can
find more downright happiness in
the spring than any other time.

That old feeling of laziness hits
pretty hard, of course, but what
would spring be anyhow without
plenty of the proverbial fever? In
spite of the steady ravages of
warm nights and drifting breezes
upon studies, in spite of all
spring’s distractions for the mod-
ern collegian, “about this time” a
fellow can’t help but awaken to
the facts of Nature’s beauty and
to the myriad gifts which ‘have
been provided to help Man along
in his marathon of Living.

Joyce Kilmer’s beautiful words
“T have a rendezvous with Death
when Spring brings back blue
days and fair” serve a better pur-
pose if we call it a rendezvous
with Life—colorful, full, achiev-
ing Life.

“When Spring trips North again

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

Much speculation has been raised as
tothe importance to be, attached to
the strike of textile workers at the
Loray mill. The majority of those
who are rebelling are young men and
women. They have been impelled and
urged by communist and labor agita-
tors. In most probability the owners
will keep production up as usual, and
the laborers will lose a few days’ wages.
What is needed more than riot pro-
tection is an ample education for the
youth of the country.

Congressman Pritchard, Asheville,
N. C, has ordered his offices closed
in Washington. The reason for this
was that the offices next to his were
occupied by Representative De Priest,
colored, of Chicago. The efforts of

And I to my pledged word am
true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous.”

Yes, that rendevous with Life!

ATTITUDE

Can serious note be taken of the
questionnaire recently submitted
to the Senior Class? Certainly
these men, about to enter the
world, are capable of taking stock
of themselves and of Davidson.

Colonel Charles.A. Lindbergh is
voted the most popular figure in
world prominence, yet surely this
does not mean that the majority
of the class inclines to aviation as
a profession. Mussolini gets a
vote, but how many are capable
or willing to be a dictator?

Browning is popular, “Pippa
Passes” perhaps aiding him.
Gray’s Elegy is admired and
loved, Robert E. Lee honored
and adored. From an interna-
tional point of view Davidson is
not ignorant, nor possessed of a
false loyalty. But more interest-
ing are subjects which confine
themselves to the campus.

Practically two-thirds of the
answers returned state that the
writers would enter Davidson
again if they knew the facts about
it as they know them now. This
is assuredly enceuraging. Few
schools can hold their own before
and after taking, when it would
come to the point of doing it all
over again.

It is a bit surprising, too to
learn that Princeton is next pre-
ferred, A northern school with
southern traditions is the order of
the day, passing over such insti-
tutions as Washington and Lee,
Georgia Tech, University of Vir-

ginia. Business is probably the
answer. Since the Civil War the
South has leaned. toward the

North in business matters, it is
only natural that we look to it to
some extent, for education.

On curricular lines we appear to
stand as one. No comments are
necessary, nor are they in order.
A broadening out along scholas-
tic lines is progressing rapidly
under the present administration,
we cannot but hope that attention
will be paid to this phase of cur-
rent opinion.

Athletic equipment is the cry-
ing need, if we are to believe these
men who have’been four years on
the campus. That Red and Black
Machine deserves all that money
can give it. The time can not be
far away when more funds will be
allotted to these improvements.

We can safely assume. these
views of the Senior Class to be a
fair barometer of campus feeling.
Nor should we misunderstand
certain parts of it. Honest crit-
icism does not mean dissatisfac-
tion, nor does it mean disloyalty
or disapproval. The question-
naire should be regarded as an ef-
fort to make ourselves seen as
we really are. Davidson must
prosper by it.

Current Comment
By John Brown

We have lost one of our greatest am-
bassadors by the death of Myron T. Her-
rick a few days ago. It has been largely
through his ability and statesmanship
that France and America have been
drawn closer together with bonds of
friendship. Washington will have to look
hard and long to find as capable a man
to replace him.

Cincinnati has recently given her
firemen police powers. At a general fire
alarm they bring out their fire-fighting
apparatus at sixty-five important street
intersections, blocking traffic and pre-
venting the escape of criminals, The fire-
men are warned not to enter a house in
the capacity of fire-fighters and then use
their police power to arrest anyone who
may be in the building.

From all reports and newspaper ac-
counts, it seems that the biggest fish
always gets away, but the biggest still is
always seized.

»Q{ the two general types of airplane
motofs—air-cooled and water-cooled, the
air-cooled motors offer excessive air re-
sistance which retard’ the motion of the
ship, and the water-cooled motors require
heavy radiators and water which add
heavily to the load. A new liquid has
been brought forward for use in radia-
tors. It is called ethylene glycol and is
a polyhydric alcohol. It is clear, color-
less and pleasant smelling and has a high
boiling point of 387 degrees. An air-
plane requires a smaller amount of this
liquid than of water, consequently a
smaller radiator and less air resistance.

various individuals, modeled on the
lives of Harriet Stowe, and William
Lloyd Garrison, have been and must
be doomed to eventual failure. Racial
prejudice is a necessity for the effec-
tual separation of the white and black.

Rebel forces in Mexico hace tempor-
arily ceased fighting and have given
the cause as lack of firearms and am-
munition. Federal supporters are
doubtless glad that the days have
passed when plow-shares and pitch-
forks were made into effectual weap-
ons. Our country paid little attention
to the difficulty but when rebel planes
dropped a few bombs on American
soil, a prompt and severe warning was
the result.

An interesting incident occurred in
a conflict between the two armies.
Two planes approached each other
with determination and vengeance. A
“dog-fight” ensted*until both pilots
were out of ammunition and_ their
machine, guns useless. Coming closer
to one another each found the other
to be an American. Waving cordial
greetings they parted and flew back to
headquarters. The day of gentlemen
adventurers has not passed, but we
will wager that both of the men were
Irishmen.

War-time customs must give way to
those of peace, however. Instead of
dieting on corn-bread and soy beans
ex-secretary Hoover, now the presi-
dent, takes: his morning exercise with
a six pound medicine ball. It will be
something novel for visiting diplomats,
when bréakfasting at the White House,
to throw off dignity and toss the pill
around, Perhaps secret service men
will be present to pick up the ball when
it drops and wipe the dew from it.

Sunday was the 2oth anniversary
of Peary’s discovery of the North
Pole. Arctic travel in those days was
filled with dangers, privations, and
loneliness, Dependence was placed in
dog teams, which drug sleds slowly
‘through the snow. The two decades
have seen myriad changes. Byrd has
flown over the same spot and returned
to his base in sixteen hours. Radio
brings home close to explorers. But
one cannot refrain from recalling the
names of the past; Scott, Shackleton,
Amundsen, Nansen, Stefansson, and
others who braved perils that the
earth might know itself.

Thoughts while hoofing the cam-
pus: Uncle Sam prepared for the
government inspection, up with the
flags! Return from Easter vacation
and general hilarity. Surprise to the
nth degree, a cut in Latin. Richard-
studes. At last thea wketaoitiaititit

Contemporary Thought

Is West Point
An “Amateur
Institution?”

“Unless there have been some revolu-
tionary changes recently,” states P. S.
Day in the May College Humor, “the
mode of academic instruction is quite the
opposite of modern pedagogical theory.
It is largely the blackboard recitation, a
mechanical, authoritative classroom pro-
cedure, and not really teaching in the
true sense. It is more the practice of
the schoolmasters of the past who de-
manded that their pupils absorb the daily
dose or take the consequences. But al-
though it is far from the idealized Socra-
tic method, the daily recitation required
of each cadet is markedly effective in
Preventing that disastrous gap between
good intentions and their execution, which
is so apt to appear under the popular
lecture system. The evils of postponed
mental effort are not a problem at West
Point.

“However, as long as the bulk of in-
struction is performed by young grad-
uates temporarily assigned to the duty
and whose sole qualification is that they

stand reasonably well in the subject which
they are expected to teach, the quality

of that instruction must leave much to
be desired. As Admiral Sims said in
referring to the same condition at Annap-
olis, it is an ‘amateur institution. Having
been a member of this amiable sodality
of ‘amateurs’ as an instructor of mathe-
matics, I can only say, in the language
of the cadets: ‘The charge is correct;
the offense was unintentional.’ I remem-
ber one of my colleagues who had three
morning classes in the same subject con-
fiding to me that he learned the day’s
lesson from the first class, recited along
with the second, and tried to put over a
modicum of instruction in the third. In
reality the cadet has to dig it-alt-out by
himself or go without, and that is largely
the West Point theory. The \instructor
is hardly more than a monitor to tabu-
late the grades,

“I do not mean to imply by the above
ruminations that the West Point instruc-
tor is less competent than the great ma-
jority of classroom instructors in other
colleges. Ordinarily his shortcomings
are not due to lack of sufficient intelli-
gence. And if qualified graduates who
so desired were directed into the work
and kept there, the standard would un-
doubtedly be raised. It should be a per-
manent detail for all academic instructors

as it is for the professors.”
