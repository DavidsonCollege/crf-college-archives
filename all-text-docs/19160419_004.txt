EMORY WINS IN SECOND

(Continued from page 1)

consulted, the right to encourage, and
the right to warn.” He then went on
to show that the House of Commons
are the real rulers and are directly ac-
countable to the people.

And responsibility and representation,
he said, should be the criterion by which
to judge of democracy. Not only is the
American Chief Executive responsible to
no one during his term of office, but it is
possible for him to be elected by a minor-
ity of the people, because of our sys-
tem of state units. Regardless, there-
fore, of whether the results of such a
system are good or evil, he said, unde-
niably it is not democratic.

Touching on the judiciary, he called
attention to the power which the Su-
preme Court had arrogated to itself of
passing on the constitutionality of laws
and thus often thwarting the will of the
people as in the case of the income tax
law, which was delayed thirteen years
by the vote of one single judge. He
closed his argument with the challenge
to the negative to show a single agency
in the British government which could
effectually thwart the will of the peo-
ple, while in the United States he cited
four—the all-powerful committee in the
House of Representatives, the minority
in the Senate, the President’s veto, and
the opinion of five judges appointed by
the President and not accountable to the
people.

Cline spoke first on the negative, de-
fending the Constitution on the grounds
that restraint, rules and principles of
conduct are necessary for the individual,
and affirming that the State is only the
individual writ large. He argued that
the American not only can, but has been
changed by a true majority. He then
endeavored to prove that the real power
of the English government is vested in
the Cabinet, which is largely controlled
by the King and Lords.

King, the second speaker on the nega-
tive, interspersing his arguments with
frequent flashes of humor and _ satire.
maintained in a dramatic way that the
one party domination in England fails
to express the will of the people as
freely as the American primaries. And
after being elected he claimed that the
House of Commons simply follows the
dictates of the Cabinet, which in turn is
dominated, by the Prime Minister. He
illustrated this point with the story of
the old sexton who boasted that he could
pump any tune the organist could play.

he Commons, too, he said, could pump
anv legislative tune the Cabinet plays.

He then referred to the appointment
of Bishops by the Crown and to their
influence in| moulding public opinion,
maintaining that no State could be truly
democratic when there was such a direct
connection between Church and State.

Finally he contrasted the central pow-
er of the British government with the
State and local government of the
United States, and concluded by saying
that if the Federal government were
abolished the States could still exist with
little or no change in their present form
of government.

DR. JOHNSON HERE SUNDAY.

Dr. T. C. Johnson filled the pulpit} p

of the local Presbyterian church Sunday
morning and evening. The subject of
the morning sermon was “Repentance,”
in which he discussed the ‘fruits of re-
pentance, and those upon’ whom the de-
mand of repentance is laid. The subject
of the evening sermon was “The Growth
of the Kingdom of God.” In the aft-
ernoon, Dr.; Johnson spoke to the Min-
isterial Band.

MARYVILLE GAME.

Maryville College, of Tennessee, took
a pretty pitcher’s duel from the locals
Saturday, 3 to 2. Currie, pitching his
maiden game for Davidson, showed

‘great stuff, and Iet his opponents down

with seven hits. La Rue pitched a mas-
terful game for the visitors, and David-
son got only seven hits.

King got two timely singles for Mary-
ville, out of four trials, and starred with
the willow for the visitors. Alford and
Saunders starred for Davidson, each
with a double and single out of three
attempts. Black took nine chances at the
hot corner without a bobble, making a
feature catch of McCall’s long foul in
the eighth.

Walker, Johnson and Saunders also
furnished stellar catches of hard hits of
the Maryville batters, checking threat-
ening rallies. It was the best game
played-on the Hill this year.

WINSTON GAME.

In a rather fast and exciting game
Davidson lost to the Winston Leaguers
at Winston Monday by a score of 7 to
3. Inability to hit Glazener, who start-
ed the game for Winston, was the main
factor in the team’s defeat. Baum-
gardner, who succeeded Glazener in the
sixth, was touched up for four hits,
which counted for two runs. The field-
ing of both teams was fast and snappy.
Only one hour and thirty-five minutes
was consumed in the playing of the
game. The only especial feature in the
contest was Black’s home run, which
went over the left field boards.

DAVIDSONIAN STAFF HOLDS
ANNUAL BANQUET

On last Thursday night the retiring
and incoming Davidsonian stafts held
their annual banquet in the Civic League
hall. Besides the members of the two
staffs there were present L. A. Mullen,
representing the Annual; J. M. Mc
ryde, representing the Magazine, and
Mr. Jackson, from the College. J. P.
Williams, retiring editor-in-chief, acted
as toast-master. Among the speeches of
the evening those of Mr. Jackson and
Price were the most edifying, while the
remarks of Mullen were very witty and
interesting. The banquet was served by
the Civic League. and proved one of en-
joyment to all. The hall and table were
very prettily decorated with spring
flowers.

J. M. Wearn, '18, was initiated into
the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity last week.
