night. Get your tickets now! .

music, music, music...

Although last week provided the campus with lots of good music via the

_ Opera and Meisburg and Walters (not to mention the Dynamic Upsetters) this
week might even top that.

The headliner act of the week is, of course, Dave Brubeck. He and his three

‘sons, composing the New Brubeck Quartet, will present a concert on Friday,

November 3 at 8 pm in Love Auditorium. Tickets are $4.00. They have

_ performed internatidnally and have two top-selling jazz albums currently on the
charts. It’s definitely a “don’t miss” show!

Next is Davidson’s own Wind Ensemble, giving its first indoor concert on
campus in several years. Directed by William Lawing and featuring solo pianist
Cynthia Lawing. The concert will be held at 8:15 pm, November 6 in Love.
Auditorium.

And finally on November 10-11, Davidson hosts the 19th Annual Sacréd

students from area schools and other Davidson students in the Charlotte
Consortium Showcase.

area talent is showcased

Remember Top Hats and Cat Tales? Well, some of the top performers in that
show along with other talented Davidson students will get their chance to break
into the “‘big-time”’ (well, almost) on Saturday. Sam Sommers and Liza White,
Windfall, Harry Pickens and his Trio and performers of comparable caliber from

other area schools will be performing in the Charlotte Consortium Showcase to
be held-in the 900 Room.

Performers from UNCC, Belmont Abbey, Barber-Scotia, Queens, Winthrop,
Wingate and Sacred Heart colleges will be featured, and committees from each
school similar to our Intimate Performers committee will attend for the purpose
of checking out the “local talent” and possibly booking some of the acts for their
schools.

The Showcase was started last year and has two primary objectives: to give
students opportunities to perform and to provide area schools with a source of’ '

- low-cost programming. As a result of last year’s Sho » Davidson booked ~
* two or three acts for the 900 Room, and several Davic acts received bids t
perform elsewhere. William Brown, assistant Union director, predicts that t
