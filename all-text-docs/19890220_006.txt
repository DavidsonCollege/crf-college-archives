Patricia’s Peeves:

Dating at Davidson: what the tour guide forgot to tell you...

Well, I’ve been here two years and the
dating situation still amazes me. Why are
Davidson guys afraid to ask girls out? I
think the trustees made a rule when they
decided to accept women. It must state,
“Male students must never ask female stu-
dents out unless it is Homecoming, Mid-
Winters or Spring Frolics. They should
resist even casual get togethers if at all
possible-this includes movies, concerts
and take-out Chinese dinners.” There also
must be an amendment freeing Queenies of
this rule, but that’s another article.

I’m writing this to warn you about the
patterns of pevieeon — (when it oc-
curs).

CASE STUDY: It is Mid-Winters and
wonder of wonders, a Davidson guy asks

you to go. You are thrilled because you’ve
found this guy intriguing since the first day
you saw him. He has bright eyes, creativity
and a great sense of humor. What could go
wrong? Well, nothing immediately...these
things take time.

He asks you out on Sunday night promis-
ing to come by as soon as he knows more
details. Friday rolls around and you think,
“Gee, I’m supposed to go out with that
wonderful guy tonight but he hasn’t even
called. Come to think of it, I haven’t seen
him for days. Maybe aliens abducted him
to model their clones after-he is awfully
cute. It’s getting so late. I’d go with aclone
to Mid-Winters.” You start thinking about
heating up a Lean Cuisine, and he calls,
“Can you be ready in an hour?” You drop

the frozen lasagna on your foot, muffle
your scream and reply, “Sure, no problem.”

You have longer than an hour because
he’s late. You don’t know if this is good
because you had time to get your pantyhose
on straight, or if it’s bad because it’s the
second time that he has made you wait.
He’s batting a thousand. But when he
comes to the door, you notice that he looks
sexy in a (sportscoat) and he compliments
your dress, His tardiness is long-forgotten.
It’ s really easy for guys to get on your good
side. Too easy.

Dinner is wonderful. Doubling with
another couple, you go to your favorite

- ethnic restaurant in Charlotte. You notice

the other couple is fooling around under the
table and you wonder if they think you’re

blind. You are also surprised at how well
they can keep up with the dinner conversa-
tion when their attentions are evidently so
far away. You don’t really care-you’re just
happy everything seems to be running
smoothly. Usually, by this time you have
talked enough with your date to realize you
don’t have much in common (he collects
automatic weapons, you collect peace
stickers). But you're still attracted to this
guy, in fact he’s better than you thought.
You talk in the car on the way home-

things look good. You’re enjoying the

party at his fraternity-things look great.
You want to blend in, so. :
