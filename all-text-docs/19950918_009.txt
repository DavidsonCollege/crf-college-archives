~ permission to set up a homepage of
their own. With a little effort,
these homepages can become com-
bination autobiographies, photo
galleries, and electronic hang-outs
— frontier outposts on the Internet.
One of the first Davidson stu-
dents to establish a homepage was
Chris Edwards, an assistant at the

Computing Services Center.
A visitor to his page is greeted

witha small black-and-white photo |

set against a black, decidedly un-
Netscape-looking background.

Scrolling down, one could
choose to read his biography or
jump to any one of several “favor-
ite pages,” including such intrigu-
ing choices as a current weather
forecast for the Charlotte area and
the National Air and Space
Museum’s homepage.

Naturally, Davidson College’s
own World Wide Web server oc-
cupies the top spot on the list.

If a student is not fortunate
enough to work for the Computing
Services Center, his next best bet
for establishing a homepage is to
convince one of Davidson’s aca-
demic departments to “loan” him
some of their scarce disk space on
the campus Web server.

fortunate in this regard, since that
department actively encourages its
students to set up homepages.
Within the Physics
Department’s server, one can find
homepages for some seven stu-

dents and six graduates. Perusing .

them turns up such oddities as a
full-screen Calvin and Hobbes car-
toon, an art gallery, and even a
radar image of Washington, D.C.,
ostensibly to let the aliens know
where to land.

When will Davidson’s entire
student body be able to construct
homepages of their own?

According to Ann Bower, the
coordinator of the Academic

Helpdesk services, not soon.

Disk space on Davidson’s
servers is extremely cramped, and
several support issues need to be
worked out before the Web can be
opened to the masses.

However, she does state, “Al-
lowing all students to create
homepages is our ultimate goal.”

Within the next few years,
Davidson students may be able to
invade the World Wide Web en
masse.

Until then, there is enough
Davidsoniana online at various
sites across the world to keep even
the most avid “Web-surfer’” occu-
pied.

here in Mecklenburg County don’t
get the recognition they deserve.
It’s very disappointing to experi-
ence. I’ve been pushed a lot —
people tell me no, you’re not one
of those capable individuals. I
prove to myself constantly that I
am and that I can do just as well as
anybody else. I’ve had a lot of
turn-downs. That’s why I talk to
the young people a lot — they give
me the spirit to keep moving. If I

don’t hang onto the spirit to keep

moving I may as well gohome and”

lock myself in and never come out.

So you write to get the recog-
nition you deserve. What do you
think about your effect on read-

ers? What do you want them to get

from it?

That there are people who can
succeed when other people are say-
ing no; a pick-me-up for some
people; that coffee to give them
that lift in the morning. A neigh-
bor said, you got published in the
Davidson Gazette and the Char-
lotte Post, congratulations — this
woman I never thought would
holler congratulations to me.

Album Review

The Verve strike
a nerve with new album

By Curis MANN
Guest Writer

In 1993, England’s The Verve
put out their first full-length album
entitled A Storm In Heaven, which
was immediately hailed as a psy-
chedelic rock masterpiece. Dur-
ing 1994’s Lollapalooza they were
the darlings of the second stage —
so much so that Rolling Stone la-
beled them:a “must-see band” and
quipped, “before one of the mem-
bers dies.” That was almost the
case during that tour; indeed, The
Verve live the rock androll lifestyle
to its often dangerous extremes
and make no apologies for it.

Their second full-length, A
Northern Soul, branches out in dif-
ferent directions fromthe hazy bliss
of Storm. Richard Ashcroft lets
his vocals burst to the forefront,
pouring his heart and soul into it,
much like Chris Robinson of the

Black Crowes. He broods inces- ©

santly about relationship problems,
saying that “I wanna die alone in
bed” and claiming that “finding

myself used to be hard, but now I
see the light. If love is a drug, then
I don’t need it.” All of this emo-
tional outpouring reveals limita-
tions in Ashcroft’s voice and lyr-
ics, but the sincerity allows The
Verve to somehow pull it off.
Even the dramatic, string-
laden ballad “History” strikes a
chord without being overly

_ schmaltzy. There is a probable hit-

single (uh-oh, the cat’s out of the
bag) in the acoustic-based “On
Your Own.” Nick McCabe’s gui-
tar-work remains stellar through-
out, maintaining Storm’s psyche-
delic-feel and adding occassional
explosiveness.

All in all, A Northern Soul
does not match the rolling hills
majesty and concept-album feel of
Storm, but instead reaches out in
new directions. Some flaws are
exposed, but The Verve certainly
surpasses most generic “alterna-
tive” rock, soaring above and be-
yond the muck through the “stormy
clouds on the new horizon.”
Definetely an enjoyable trip.
