Colorful Stacks Kids

Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Vickie, answer the door,”

sounded a_ feminine

voice-from within. I waited on the porch of the gray
slatted ‘house near the laundry, A bicycle lay on its side

in the yard.

Presently, the door swung
open, pulling its little opener
precariously off balance. Catch-
ing her breath and lifting her
right arm for balance, Vickie
Rae Stacks, 7, responded to my
request to see her mother by
first curiously turning her head
at an angle; and then ignited
by an “O. K., just a minute,”
she turned and ran into a rear
room. ‘

Mrs. Stacks, inviting me in,
was holding the hand of a
wiggling, round-faced boy
wrapped in a blue, fur-collar-
ed coat and matching cap
pulled down over his ears.
“This is J. L.,” she said, when
we were seated. “He's the
youngest.”

J. L. I recognized as the de-
manding bearer of the dime
store six-shooter or garden rake
which amusingly hinders fra-

ternity members in their walk
to and from meals. Escaping
the grip of his mother’s hand,
he now began to beat on the
sofa cushions.

Futilely trying to quiet him
down, Mrs. Stacks continued,
“J. L. takes care of himself.
He's his own boss, as you can
probably see.”

At this time Vickie returned
from the back room and hopped
up in the hardbacked chair

near the sofa. J. L. left the sofa
to get a golf club he saw on the
floor.

“Vickie,” said Mrs. Stacks,
‘Gs seven. She’s in her second
‘year of school here.” Vickie,

and violet dress enhancing a
pretty smile and sparkling.
lively eyes, sat‘silently listening
until the conversation approach-
ed the topic of the fraternity
boys ‘who pass her house. “We
used to make ’em hold the rope

Dorit just

for us when we jumped rope
not long ago,’ she primmed.
The front door opened and
C. W., Je., entered, wearing
@ large brimmed hat and car-
tying his coat in his hand.
Cc. W., a rising teenager and
sixth grader in Davidson,
loves basketball, baseball, and
tennis. “I’m going to be a
tennis pleyer when |! grow
up,” he contributed as he left
the room to return shortly.

J. L. by this time was beating
the sofa with the golf club he
had found. “J. L.!’ Mrs. Stacks
pleaded, “you'll hit somebody!”
J. L. curled his tongue and nar-
rowed his shoulders slightly in
shame and shifted his clubbing
to the flooring.

“C. W.’s the quiet type most-
ly,” asserted Mrs. Stacks. ‘He's
a straight A student so far, and
he likes to play the piano and
the flute. I don’t ever have to
tell him to practice. He does it
on his own.”

“Sometimes we can get into
it and blow it our own self,”
added Vickie mischievously.

J. ., club in hand, ran to
the door and cantered out-
side. Cautiously, the Stacks’
low - slung rat terrier, ven-
tured through the open door-
way and attracted conversa-
tion. “That's Jigger,” said
Mrs. Stacks. “The kids’ love
him. They all claim him, but
they don’t feed him.”

rose to leave, “We certainly
will miss the boys when we
move. Only time we haven't

As I left the house and walk-

In an interview this week,
Gillis answered questions re
garding statements in his letter
of resignation.

How has THE DAVIDSON-
tAN “misrepresented David-
son College to the general
public’?

Although the editor insists no
bias appears in his news, those

idson, and all who read the
CHARLOTTE NEWS think the
veiws of the Trustee Special
represent a demand for inte-
gration of Davidson, by David-
son students, in majority.

This is a misrepresentation,
whether intended or not.

You imply thet “cruseding
or opinions on controversial
subjects” has not been “con-
fined to the editorial sections
of the newspaper.” Please
give evidence of this.

I think the Trustee Special is
evidence enough of crusading.

tion.

What is meant by your state-
ment that “THE DAVIOSON-
1AN should belong to the
college community and not to
any faction or group”? Do
you feel that the editor
should express only majority
opinions, or avoid expressing
controversial opinions, re-
gardless of his convictions?

1 am not complaining about
THE DAVIDSONIAN express-
ing any opinion, as long as it is
confined to the editorial sec-
tions, and the majority of the
paper be given over to news.

What is mesnt by your
allegation that “a growing
misuse” of THE DAVIDSON-
1AN is now in progress?

spond to their courses? Why
don't they go to the library and
study with interest?” This sit-
uation is not a result of a poor
faculty, but rather results from
student apathy and general dis-
interest in academics.

(5) There is a definite lack
of senior leadership. The lead-
ers here are not challenged to
produce. Moreover, the intel-
lectual leaders all eventually
move off campus.

FRATERNITIES

The cause ‘for these symp-
toms, according to Warden, is
the fraternity system as it now
‘stands. He hastened to add,
however, that he feels that fra-
ternities can be very beneficial
to the Davidson campus.

To correct the current faults
with the fraternity system, War-
den proposed that a sophomore
rush program be instituted. He
explained that such a systém
would force the fraternities to
prove themselves, and thus
would result in a strengthening
of the fraternity system.

To the freshmen who want to
be fraternity members but also
feel that the fraternities de-
mand too much time of a
pledge, Warden suggested that
they tell their pledge trainers
that they would like to be in-
active pledges while they de-
cided whether the fraternities
deserve the time’ they require.

After 25 minutes presenta-
tion, Warden opened the floor
for questions.

to me,” he said.

(1) They provide opportunity
for group association. Through
this group they develop friend-
ship and mutual understanding.
But the group itself is not an
exclusive one. The so-called
barrier between fraternities
and the independents is a false
one.

(2) Fraternities develop per-
sonality, particularly through
the pledge program. It is ad-
mittedly possible for the results
to be a bad one, but the good
results outweigh the bad.

(3) They offer the traditions
of high ideals and brotherhood.
The ritual may be lacking in
practice, but it is there none-
the less. Scholarship is stressed
throughout the year.

(4) Fraternities are the basis
of Davidson College social life.
This phase extends not only to
dance weekends, but is mani-
fested in weekend gatherings
and fraternity retreats. They
are a valuable means to gain
social poise and to make con-
tacts.

REBUTTAL

After making his positive
statements, McKeithen turned
to an examination of Warden's
presentation. “I. cannot agree,”
he said, “that the fraternities
are responsible for the apathy
on the campus. I think that it
is due more to the lack of stu-
dent leadership, both in general
campus life and in extracur-
ricular activities.

“As far as deferred rush is
concerned, I think there are
definite advantages to the idea.
There is one thing that worries
me, however. I think we have
a good degree of diversification
in. the fraternities now, and I’m
afraid that a deferred: rush sys-
tem would destroy this diversi-
fication.” ;

McKeithen concluded that
“fraternities are a necessary
good and. are an integral part
of the philosophy of education
at Davidson.”

Faculty Loses Six Men
On Sabbaticals, Leaves

By DAVID JORDAN

Davidsonian Assignments Editor
Four Davidson professors will be on sabbatical next year and two others will

be away from the college on a year’s

leave of absence, Dean of Faculty Frontis

Johnston told the DAVIDSONIAN this week.

The Board of Trustees ap-
proved the requests of these
men at their meeting Jast week
and authorized them to proceed
with their plans. At the same

time, Dean Johnston began
seeking replacements.
Dr. George Labban, Dr.

George Abernethy, Dr. Charles
Ratliff and Professor Douglas
Houchens will be on sabbaticals.
Dr. Labban will be away for
only the first semester, while
the other men have been given
the full year. Dr. Bruce Jackson
and Professor Brooks ‘McLane
are taking the leaves of ab-
sence.

Dean Johnston commented
that this was the largest num-
ber of men to be away from
the college in one year that
he could remember. “It is
something thet the college.
feels is good for its faculty.
It gives them an opportunity
to keep up with new material
in their fields, and ‘recharge
their batteries’.”

Professors receive full salary
for a one semester sabbatical or
half salary for a full year. Mem-
bers of the faculty on leaves of
absence do not draw any salary.

The sabbaticals affect two de-
partments in which only one
professor teaches, philosophy
and art, and with the exception
of only one class, Dr. Labban
has all the Greek courses.

In addition te replacing
these men, new professors
will also be needed in the
absence of Dr. Pedro Trakas
and Professor John Satter-
field, who are becoming mem-
bers of the new Florida Pres.
byterian College, Professor
John Evans, who is taking a

pastorate, and Dr. Jay Ost- |

walt who is going to the Med-
ical College of Virginia.

Dr. Labban will be spending
three and a half months in the
area of Italy, Greece, Turkey,
Lebanon and the Aegean Is-
lands doing work on first and
second century Greek and Latin
epigraphy. He intends to work
especially in the area of the
Syro-Phoenician merchant
guilds.

Professor Houchens plans to
continue the work which he
started last summer. He will
