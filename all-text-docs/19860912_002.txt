‘New field hockey c coach seeks fresh start

“By EDWIN PAGE

-Next Friday when the David-
son women’s field hockey team
plays its home opener you will
probably notice a few new faces
on the Davidson sidelines. And
while this may be normal, one of

=~

the new faces may come as a sur-
prise. The face in question be-
longs to the team’s new coach,
Betsy Pryor.

Pryor comes to Davidson from _
The Westtown School, a private
school near Philadelphia where

Women’s volleyball

By MIKE ADAMS

Despite a shaky start, the
Davidson women’s volleyball
team is set to open its first varsity

season after several years at the.

club level. The elevation to
NCAA Division I status came as a
result of succéss at the club level
and as a means of preserving
Davidson’s. Division I status in
other sports.
.. The season began on a sour
note when the team’s first year
coach resigned after only four
days. Susan Hayes, a graduate as-
sistant athletic trainer, took over
the coaching duties about a week
later. Hayes said the team con-
‘tinued to practice in the interim.
Hayes said she believes the
.Lady Cats can accomplish the
move to Division I status with lit-

tle. difficulty. She said the talent -

level has probably fallen because
of losses dué to graduation, but

there are several team members
who have played against-many of
the schools on their schedule and a
.500 or-better season is certainly
possible. .

The team is very young, with
four freshmen and two sopho-
mores among its 11 members.
Hayes said, “They’re young and
inexperienced, but they have a lot
of enthusiasm and a lot of raw tal-
ent.”

The Lady Cats are also shorter
than. most collegiate volleyball
«squads. They average about 5’7”,
while, according to Hayes, most
college teams average no less than

59”

Several players have demon-
strated strength in preseason prac-
tice. Sophomores Maria Douglas
-and Molly Cochran are both ex-
cellent setters and hitters. (A set-
ter, obviously, sets up the shot of
the hitter, who attempts to spike

~ the ball to win a point or break the ”

Qpens first varsity season

opponent’s service.)

Douglas and Cochran are also
excellent servers, as are senior
Bonnie Bolton. and freshman
Sarahi Johnson. ,

Junior Beth Elder, at 5’11” the
tallest woman on the team, is de-
veloping into an excellent front-
line player both as a blocker on de-
fense and a hitter on offense.

At least for this year, the Lady
Cats will be“competing in’ the
Southern Conference. Western
Carolina is the conference power
and one of the strongest teams

Davidson will play this year, but

the Cats should be able to top Fur-
mah and some of the other second
division teams in the conference.
According to Hayes, the most
important factor for the team is

‘Sports

Pryor accepted the Davidson
job on August 23 and reported for
work the next week. She takes
over a team that posted a 5-?? re-
cord last year and is long on inex-
perience. Although cautious
about making any predictions for
the season, Pryor says she is “re-

.ally optimistic about the team.

They are willing to work hard and
put out a lot of effort. That’s the
first step.”

So far Pryor has stressed the
basics: positioning, dribbling, hit-
ting and stopping the ball. The
team’s performance in the Deep
South umpiring clinic showed the.
need to work on these skills.

She is also making sure the
team will be physically ready to
play when they open their season
Wednesday at Wake Forest. “T’ve
never lost a game because my
team was out of shape.”

A bright spot for.the team this
year is that twenty. women have.
come out for the team, the most
that have been out in several
years. While many of them are in-
experienced the increased compe-
tition for spots should be a boon.
Once again the team will be led by
senior sweeper Heather McKee.
McKee, who Pryor calls a “do-

‘minant strength,” will be a key for

thé tearn both offensively and de-
fensively. She starts the attack
with her long hits and represents
the last line of defense before
senior goalie Naria Lay.

1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

——

Lay, who is coming off a sur-
prising year when she was. moved
from the field to the goal, should
improve even more this year.
Pryor played goalie and considers
developing keepers one; of her
strengths as a coach. She feels that
Lay’s good instincts and and ag-
gressive play show. a lot of prom-
ise. ;
Senior Polly Northen returns
after a one year absence and
should provide a steadying force
in the midfield from her center
halfback position. Newcomer
sophomore Susan Montgomery
has shown promise at upsweeper,
and freshman’ Marta Bukowski
has made an impact at center for-
ward. Pryor says of her, “she is
very quick and aggressive, and
she has a great” determination to
score.”

Due to the inexperience of the
team and, her own unfamiliarity
with the competition on the
schedule, Pryor is cautious about
evaluating the team’s chances for
success. ‘We have a wide range of
players from beginners to some
very talented people. We have to
put them together and come up
with thé right combination. We
have good potential for success
against schéols our size. I am re-
ally optimistic about the team.
Win or lose, we'll be in the
game.”

The team’s first home game is
scheduled for 4 p.m. next Friday
against Salem.

Coach Andrew

itakes over cross

country reins

By PAM HARMANN
The cross country team begins .

its fall 1986 season with time trials

on Sept. 20. Alumni runners have
been invited to provide the team
competition, and some faculty
will run as well.

The new cross country course
has a rough route which will hope-
fully be smoothed out by this
meet. The Winthrop Invitational
on Sept. 27 will be the official sea-
son opener.

Coach. Gary Andrew is start-
ing his first season as the ‘cross
country coach. He arrived in Nov.
of 1985 and took over the indoor/
outdoor track teams. He formerly
‘coached the Chapel Hill High
School cross country team to six
state championships.

Coach Andrew is assisted by
Jay Braun, a 1986 Davidson
graduate who was the track cap-
tain last season. He is also helping +
to prepare the cross-country -
course for preseason track condi-
tioning. The squad began its pre-

season training on September 3
__with a trip to the: mountains. They

maintaining the current level of- travelled to the Wildcat Den in

enthusiasm and intensity. She
projects a winning season if the
winning attitudes of . preseason
“continue.

Little Switzerland where rough,
hilly terrain provided intense
training,

This season’s squad is filled

with talent; yet freshmen and
sophomores compose the majority.
of the squad. Coach Andrew feels
the team has excellent prospects -
who have a really good attitude.

Attitude is an important asset to a
young, inexperienced team. As

captain of the women’s squad,

junior Jennifer -Wallace puts it,

“We all get along very well which
makes it fun.”

The top prospects for the
men’s squad include seniors Greg
Foreman and captain Emil Cekada
, junior Chris Fischer, and sopho-
mores Bob Cornish and Bill Whit- .
field. Freshmen. standouts are
David Remisiewicz ahd Jay
Clugston, who tied for the cake
race title Wednesday.

According to Cekada, “As:
long as the men’s team stays
healthy and our young runners
develop, I feel we will have the
best team we’ve had since I’ve
‘been here.”

Top women runners - are
juniors Laura Fannin, Morrow
Reeves, Wallace and fréshmen re-.
cruits English Knowles and Missy
Willis. The young team will‘pro-
vide a good base for future sea-
sons, but at the conference meet,
Andrew intends to surprise some
people.
