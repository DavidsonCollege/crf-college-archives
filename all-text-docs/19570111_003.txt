IN THE BALCONY

The athletic department’s rule restricting all spectators
of interfraternity basketball to the balcony of the gymnasium
aroused quite a furor of feeling among both the players and
spectators of these games.

Willing to cooperate, Coach Scott immediately withdrew
the rule upon the request of the fraternity sports managers
who met on Monday afternoon.

However the repeal was made with two important
stipulations: (1) no one in street shoes is to walk on the
playing floor, and (2) no one is to smoke while on the
floor or in the bleachers.

A WARNING

The restriction on hard-sole shoes applies just as much
to walking across the court on the way to and from games as
it does to actually playing in such shoes. The rule on smoking
has always been in effect and has been posted, but is frequent-
ly violated.

The athletic department made the warning that the
repealed regulation would have to be reactivated if the
two stipulations were not fulfilled.

Of all the interfraternity sports, basketball consistently
draws the largest crowds. Also, of all the sports, vocal sup-
port from the sidelines has the greatest value to basketball
players because they can hear it easily. Consequently any
move that would restrict audience participation seems
basically unwise.

CURRENT SYSTEM

At the same time it is particularly important to preserve
the floors because of the money invested in resurfacing the
entire area this summer and for refinishing after the Home-
coming Dance.

Before and after games and during time outs the specta-
tors enjoy crowding around their team to talk and to give
advice and encouragement: It would be a backward step to
prevent such association.

Yet the responsibility for maintaining the current system
lies with the student body. If we like it, let’s adhere to the
regulations.

CATS AND GA. TECH

One of the most popular rumors on the campus in recent
weeks has been that the Davidson football team might add
Georgia Tech back to its schedule in the next few years.

It is true that Tech did informally approach a mem-
ber of the scheduling committee on the possibility of
such a change but it is absolutely not true that the teams
will meet in the forseeable future. Davidson had no ear
for the deal.

The Georgia Tech representative reportedly implied that
the reason behind the consideration was that the Yellow
Jacket’s strength would be “going down” in the next few years.
This writer wonders if the representative was able to keep a
straight face while making such a statement.

SCHEDULE CHANGES

However, changes have been made in the schedule.
Lehigh will be a newcomer with a game here in 1959
and a return match in Bethlehem in 1960. William and
Mary will also enter on a home and home basis in 1958

and 1959.

Washington and Lee, with amateur football, dropped the
Cats from their schedule this year. Davidson was the only
Southern Conference foe encountered by the once powerful
Generals in 1956. The Wildcats took that contest 48-6

Stetson, another opponent of the Red and Black,
is currently considering eliminating its subsidized foot-¢
ball. If they do, they too might leave Davidson off their

schedule.

Freddie Butler, standout goalkeeper for Davidson's young
squad, was selected to the All-Southern Soccer Team last
week. Simultaneously it was announced that the local squad
elected Ross Smyth captain for the 1957 season.

ROSS SMYTH

MATMEN CLASH
WITH WOLFPACK
IN GYM SATURDAY

The Davidson College wrestling
team will meet N. C. State in a
dual meet in Johnston Gymnasium
tomorrow night at eight o'clock.

State boasts an improved team
over the squad they had last year,
the squad Davidson defeated 16-15
in one of the closest and most ex-
citing matches of last year.

The line-up for Davidson will be
as follows: 123 lbs.—Pete Cole-
man, 130 Ibs.—Bruce Shipley, 137
lbs.—Henry Griffin, 147 lbs.—Mil-
ton Gee, '157 lbs.—Butch Neal or
George Rhyne, 167 lbs.—Harold
Westervelt, 177 Ibs.—Alex Porter,
heavyweight—David Fagg.

Pete Coleman, with a 41 record
thus far, is the leading winner
on the team, closely followed by
Westervelt and Fagg.

Butler was particularly com-
mended for his performance in

i the game with the University of

North Carolina which the Tar

§ Heels won, 2-0.

The All Southern Team,
chosen on a point basis, is
composed of representatives
of such schools as Maryland,
Duke, Navy, N. C. Stete and
others.

Five players were picked for each
position on this honorary team
which is named by the National
Association of Soccer Coaches.

In a meeting of the squad held
last Friday evening, Jan. 4, Smyth
was elected captain for the com-
ing season.

Ross, a mainstay at center-
forward on this year’s team,
served as acting captain dur-
ing the remainder of the sea-
son after the injury of Danny
Crates in the Duke game.
Besides his athletic ability, Ross

is at present First Vice-President
of the student body and the recipi-
ent of a Union-Carbide Scholar-
ship.

Catfish Splash With Citadel
Bulldogs Locally Tomorrow

Meet At 3:30 Features
'Rivers-Cowden Tiit

By BRANTLEY BURNS
The powerful Citadel Bulldogs come up from Charleston
tomorrow to take on the Wildcat swimmers. Scheduled for
3:30, the meet will be held in the pool of Johnston Gymnasium.

TOMMY RIVERS, senior captain from Charleston, S. C., will
be one of the feature swimmers in tomorrow's meet with The

Citadel in the Davidson pool.

Rivers, who never swam competitive-

ly before coming to Davidson, holds two school records. He will
swim in the 50-and 100-yd freestyle events and the 440-yd free:

style relay tomorrow against

his hometown opponents.

Citadel’s splashers will enter the
contest boasting one of their best
teams in several years. For the
past several seasons, the meets be-
tween the two schools have been
extremely close, and the Bulldogs
will be trying to avenge their loss
of last year.

TIMES

The times from Citadel’s meet
with South Carolina are amazing-
ly close to the times of Davidson’s
swimmers. The military boys won
that encounter 59-27, but there was
hardly a winning time that the
Cats cannot match or better.

Two of the closest races of the
afternoon should develop between
Davidson's Captain, Tommy Rivers,
and Citadel’s crack sprinter, Cow-
den. Rivers holds the school record

Cagers Tumble Twice;

Take Break

Davidson's
basketball squad is picking up ex-
perience but apparently not fast
enough. The Red and Black hard-
wooders dropped their two post-
holidays games, loosing 104-85 to
Furman in a scoring spree and
80-67 to William and Mary.

Following the Greenville en-
counter, the Cats began a 17 day
rest period during exams, taking

Fraternity Basketball
Christened This Week

Opening with four games last Monday night, the inter-
fraternity basketball tournament got under way for a short

round just before exams.

The Betas, last year’s runner-|S.A.E., 62

ups, and the S.A.E.’s started things
off with a terrific double-overtime
game which ended with the Betas
on top by one point, 49 to 48. Both
teams played exceptionally well
for so early in the season and
promise to be two of the top con-
tenders for the title.

FORMER CHAMP

Last years first place winners,
the A.T.O.’s, did not start so well
this year, losing their opening
game, 35 to 28, to the Phi Delts.

The Sig Eps edged the Pikas 28
to 25, and the K.A.’s romped to
an easy win over the Campus Club
in the other Monday games.

On Tuesday night the S.A.E.'s
came back to beat the Pi Kapps 62
to 34 and the Kappa Sigs took
the measure of the Campus Club
in the first two contests.

SECOND LOSS

Finishing out the slate Tuesday,
the Sigma Chi’s rode over the Phi
Gams 51 to 39 and the Pikas took
their second loss from the Phi
Gams 43 to 38.

Beginning Wednesdays games,
the Phi Delts overpowered the
Betas with surprising ease 56 to
37. Ben Harris was high scorer for
the winners.

In a very close contest, the Sig:
Eps edged the K.A.’s by two points,
35 to 33. Closing out the night, the
Kappa Sigs beat the Independents
and Ed Lewis led the AT.’s over
the Campus Club.

Sixteen games were played this
week, but the bulk of the con-
tests are to be played after the
semester finals are over.

There are two available courts
which are used twice each night,
first at 7:30 and again at 8:30. The
present schedule calls for four
games each night on Mondays
through Thursdays.

SPECTATORS

Because of the limited space for
spectators caused by this two
court system, the arrangements at
first were for seating in the bal-
cony. However, this was changed
on the condition that all by-stand-
ers wearing hard-soled shoes
would stay off the playing floor.

Results of last weeks games
through Wednesday are:

Pi Kapp, 34
Kappa Sig, 101 C.C., 29
Phi Gam, 43 . Pika, 38
Sigma Chi, 51 Phi Gam, 39
Beta, 49 S.A.E., 48
Phi Delt, 35 A.T.O., 28
K.A., 59 Independents, 21

" Both the Purple Paladins
and the Wildcats were red hot
Wednesday night at Green-
ville’s Textile Hall, the former
hitting 50 per cent and the
latter 40 per cent of their
field goals.

Flashy little Dick Wright
couldn't miss for the winners as
he pumped in 30 points, assisted
by a total of 40 from the Gaines
brothers, Bill and Bob. Center
Dave Hollingsworth was high man
for the Cats with 19, followed
closely by Semi Mintz with 18.

Davidson turned in its
greatest offensive show of the
season and actually outscored
Furman the second half, but
it was not enough to over-
come the 20 point margin
which the Purple ran up in
an amazing first five minutes.

The encounter with William and
Mary last Saturday in Johnston
Gym made the second clash in
a row for the two teams. They last
met in their final round of the
Richmond Invitational Tournament
in Richmond, Virginia during the
Christmas holidays. The Indians
took that encounter 63-72.

Ratterree’s Voice Booms
Over D.C. Sports Scene

“All right! Let’s | move out
there!” A visitor dropping in the
gym one of these cold afternoons
is quite likely to hear this or
some. similar phrase sounding
above the pounding of basketballs
and feet against hardwood. The
speaker, of course, is Pride Ratt-
erree, hard-driving coach of the
Davidson J. V. hoop squad.

The newest addition to the Da-
vidson coaching family, Ratterrce
entered Wildcat service at the be-
ginning of the 1956 football sea:
son, when he assumed his duties
as head line coach. Working with
raw material, Ratterree whipped
his line into top shape. His capabil-

ities were best shown by the nu-
merous goal line stands made by
his proteges.

Coach Ratterree came to David-
son from Wake Forest, where he
was also line coach. The “Pride of
King's Mountain”, is a graduate of
the Baptist Hollow.

Upon graduation in 1944, Pride
entered professional football for
a year with the Chicago Cardinals.
At the end of that time he accept-
ed the position of assistant foot-
ball coach at Staunton Military
Academy moving up to head coach
in 1948. Next came Lenoir Rhyne,
where he served as line coach
until 1954, when he returned to his
alma mater, Wake Forest.

Obviously, Ratterree is «
man of no mean ability. In ad-
dition to his football work at

Lenoir-Rhyne, he also served as

assistant basketball coach. It

is this versatility which makes
him such a valuable asset to

Athletic Director Or. Tom

Scott.

His tremendous will to win is
probably Ratteree’s outstanding
characteristic. It has been noted
by both coaches and players. Since
coming to Davidson, he has gained
the reputation of a rough task-
master and a fair coach. The spirit
seems to have caught on with his
pupils. for they show extraordi-
nary stamina and fight.

Freshman Bill Hellier, who had

By Saturday afternoon the team
should be in near peak physical
shape.

Secking revenge for the loss to
East Carolina shortly before the
holidays, the Cats should go all
out for a win. Their record now
stands at 1-2- and a win will even it
up.

Four Represented
Davidson at NCAA

Director of Athletics, Dr. Tom

Johnston, football coach Bill Dole,
and assistant coach Pride Ratter-
ree represented Davidson at the
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation convention held Wednes-
day through Friday of this week
at St. Louis, Missouri.

Coaches Dole and Ratterree left
a day early in order to attend the
football coaches’ conferences pre-
ceding the regular sessions. Dr.
Scott was delayed until Wednes-
day night, leaving from Greenville
following the basketball game with
Furman. >

Dr. Johnston served as the lone
voting delegate.

Among the. items of business
was the discussion on whether or
not to, permit colleges to pay a
prospective athlete’s expenses to
make one trip. to visit the campus
of a school offering him a scholar-
ship. The practice which is cur-
rently outlawed, but frequently
used. was recently brought dra-
matically to the public by the case
of Jackie Moreland and North Ca-
rolina State.
