Six degress of separation? hardly...

Disc jockeys and spin doctors hob-nob with “talent”

Fartman speaks! Public ass
reveals private thoughts

Last Monday, Kevin Keeley and I heard
an announcement on Deep Cuts 95.7 that
Howard Stern would
host.a press confer- [
ence over the air from
New York to Char-
lotte the next day at
the Adam’s Mark ho- [
tel. Intrigued, I called
the Adam’s Mark
-who told me the con-
ference was not open
to the public, so I Barron
called the radio station. All I needed to do
was convince them that I would cover the
event for my college. I have written for The
Davidsonian before, and Kevin and I, along
with David Wick, host a call-in show on
WALT (Subliminal message: Listen to Jive
Talkin’ Monday and Thursday from 7-8 on
1610 AM). Sure, we had aright to be there as
much as reporters from the Charlotte Ob-
server. Bill Ramsey, the marketing director
for 95.7, accepted my*pitch and faxed me
three passes: one for me, one for David, and
one for Kevin. Although he would not be

The room was marked with a paper
sign reading “Howard Stern Press Confer-
ence,” but when we walked in we saw only
10 or 15 people. At one end, two men
tinkered with electrical equipment and mi-
crophones while T.V. cameramen were ad-
justing their tripods; at the other, ten or so
reporters nonchalantly took out their legal
pads and began to scribble. A large man
approached us, the
marketing director
for Deep Cuts, and
we introduced our-
selves.

: “Now, you all
| know that only one

of youcanaska ques-

tion.” What???

He expected us

Wick

to ask a question??

It really was a big joke. David and
Kevin nudged tf out there and said, half-
heartedly, “Good Luck.”

Aftershowing me what to do when I
came on the air, I felt the chills move from
my nae my toes as the grandeur of the
situation Struck me. I was about to talk to

. Howard Stern before 28 million people.

‘~The three of us thought of a question,
; and all [had to do was wait. As
soon as Kay McFadden from
the Observer began to flirt
with Stern after asking the first
question of the press confer-
ence, I eased up. He was so
comfortable talking to her,
mainly because he was inquir-
’ ing about her breast size and
sex appeal.

After two more ques-
tions, I took the microphone
and waited. One guy bombed
by trying to link Stern to Alan
Alda. Lesson #1- don’t make
fun of Howard. The next guy
asked Stern why he uses the
Lord’s name in vain. Howard
ripped into him like a Lion
does a helpless gazelle. Les-
son #2: don’task Howard about
religion or profanity. I figured
my question did not fit into

Howard Stern

New York Magazine

either category, and besides, it

there in person, the three of us were going to
be in Charlotte at 8:30 a.m. for the chance to
talk with Stern.

We didn’t know what to expect. To the
chagrin of many Charlotteans, the city had
just opened its market to Stern’s show. Surely
there would be a mixture of fans and critics.
How many reporters? Probably 30 or 40?
NWe had no chance of asking him a question,
but it would still be worth it. And how’s this
for an omen? Upon arriving at the parking
garage gate at the Hotel, the attendant asked,

“Are you guys going to the press conference?.

You know he’s not here. SUCKERS!!”
My stomach sank as I processed these
words. Maybe this whole event was a big
hoax. Maybe I had encouraged Kevin and
David to wake up before 7 a.m. and drive to
Charlotte for nothing. Nonetheless, I lugged
my deflated body to the conference room,
hoping that it would not be a disaster.

was too late to make any
changes. As I pulled the microphone to my
mouth, I looked to my friends for support.
All I saw were their heads buried in their
laps, too nervous to even look up at me. He
was going to destroy me!

“Are there any other questions?”

“Yeah, this is Walt Barron in Charlotte.
I’m from Davidson College, and we love
you up there.”

“Does it offend you when I say
‘goddammit’?”

“Uh, well, not really. My Dad’s a
preacher, and I think it’s okay. I think you
should have the right to say it.”

“That’s good. I mean, some of these
people get so uptight.”

“Well, I have a very serious question

_ for you. Last Friday you had a porn star,

Jeannine something, and you said she was
the only woman you would be willing to
leave your wife for. Is that correct?”

“Yes it is.”

“Well, what I want to know is, what
about Robin?”

“Would I leave my wife for Robin?”

“Yes.”

“No, because I’ve already been with her.
Actually, I get.with her every night.”

“Whatever, Howard,” replied Robin.

“And I’m real glad I don’t have to go home’

and do the laundry for him.”

After a period of brief laughter, Howard
asked, “Wait a minute, did you say you are
from a college newspaper?”

“Yes.”

“That’s another paper nobody reads. I’m
sorry, I can’t talk to you anymore. Hey! ’'m
a BIG STAR! I can’t be talking to college
newspapers.”

I didn’t even have a chance to reply. As
soon as it began, it seemed like it was over.

Although I wanted to keep talking with him,
it was probably better that I didn’t. Judging
_ ——-rey {rommy predecessors,
] Howardcan make any-
one look stupid. I
should consider my-
selflucky thathe didn’t
make me look worse.
Actually, I can’t
‘| lie. I loved it. Sure,
Stern made me look a
little dumb, but I did
actually talk with him.
He is shocking, flamboyant, and derogatory,
but he sure is entertaining. Although I don’t
agree with his ideals, I have to admit I am
grateful for that minute.
__ Maybe Stern thought I was wasting his
time, but at least I threw a shout out for good
old Davidson College.

Three lucky

By SARAH Zeocey

There are only two things I need to do
before I die: meet Madonna and be a contes-
tant on a national gameshow. Well, in the
next 18 months one of those landmarks will
be crossed off my list. No, I will not being
having lunch with the Material Girl.

I am an official future contestant on
Wheel-of-Fortune, as are Ouida Arnell and
Mecie Beecheem. I will receive a call a week
before my taping date, giving me just enough
time to pack my bags, explain to my profes-
sors why I MUST miss a week of classes and
jet to sunny Culver City, CA, city of dreams.

How did the three of us get so lucky,
achieving the dream of every kid who ever sat
for hours in front of their glowing boob tube,
hypnotically eating Toastie-O’s in footy p.j.’s?
It could have been you, too.

All we did was enter a random drawing
sponsored by NBC, Bojangles, and Kiss ra-
dio station. We were selected, along with 180
other Charlotteans, for an audition at the
Marriott (there were about 10 other Davidson
students).

The lot of us met in aconvention room in

>i ff Sebenees

contestants

spin the wheel

groups of 60 and sat around playing mock
puzzles to see if we (a) knew how to play and
(b) had a genuine love for the game. I even
answered one puzzle and so I got to bring it
home. Should you ever want to see it it’s
hanging up on my wallinallit glory: CASPER
* THE *_R_END__ * GHOST * _R_TER.
(The category was “Before and After, which
had luckily been explained to me by Dom
Talvacchio just hours before the audition!)

* After making it to the final audition
stage, we were forced to wait two weeks for
a ltter that told us whether or not we would be
contestants.

Now all I need to wait for is the immi-
hent call. There is one small problem that
may keep me from ever meeting Pat and
Vanna: money. If anyone recollects the
plasma article a few weeks ago you will know
that Iam very low on funds. Unfortunately,
I would have to pay for both airfare and hotel
accommodations when I go.

Hopefully I would win enough on the
actually show to repay any of my expenses.
So keep your T.V.’s tuned in on Wheel-of-
Fortune for Ouida, Mecie, and my future
appearances, and if you should think of any
puzzles, I’m game for hang-man at any time.

Juniors Ouida Arnell, Mecie Beecheem, and Sarah Zogby move to the Big
Wheel soon, hoping to score big money. Contestants keep all prizes won.
