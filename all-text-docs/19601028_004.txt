performed two other major
tasks this year. One was a
behind-the-scenes discussion

ing the hectic period of riots

action was the planning and
execution of what was con-
sidered a very successful

Western colleges, the main pur-
pose being to study curriculum

that section of the country.

Johnston visited two colleges
in particular, Occidental and
Pomona.

Angeles is a small liberal arts,

In the mock gubernatorial
election, the 35 write-ins in-
cluded mainly those candidates
who were defeated in the Demo-
mocratic primaries: Dr. I. Bev-
erly Lake, Malcolm Seawell,
and John Larkins.

Among the ballots that were
voided becayse of ridiculous
write-ins were votes for presi-
dent or vice - president for
Huckleberry Hound, Bernard
-Goldfine and Sherman Adams,

General MacArthur, Eugene V.
Debbs, Alfred E. Newman, and
Emma Goldberg.

’ Ed Johnston, co-ordinator of
the poll and Chairman of the
Union Roundtable Committee,
received three of the voided
votes in the gubernatorial elec-
tion. Votes for Charles Rose,
“Chrustchoff", and. Yogi Bear
were also voided by the Round-
table Committee.

Ed Johnston, co-ordinator of
the mock election, said, “Due
to the large number of ballots

cast in the mock presidential
election, “I think this is an
accurate representation of the
political sentiment on the
Davidson Campus, ‘as far as the
presidential election goes.
“The gubernatorial vote re-

flects the feelings of the Stu-
dent Body, he said, “but since
it included the vetes of hun-
dreds of out-of-state students
it has little real significance in
indicating how the guberna-
torial race will come out.”
