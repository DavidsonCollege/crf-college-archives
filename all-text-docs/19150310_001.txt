Both as a class and as individuals the
Juniors are to be commended upon the
general excellence of their Oratorical
exercises held on Friday and Saturday
of last week. All of the speeches were
good, and many of them, both as re-
gards subject matter and manner of de
livery, would have done credit to speak-
ers and orators older and more expert
enced in the art of public speaking. “Vhe
orderly and logical way in which each
speaker handled his subject should be a
fair indication of his ability and fitness
for discussing before his fellowmen ques
tions of public weal after his college
days shall have ended.

For variety of subjects the program
could hardly have been better arranged.
While one speaker inculcates our minds
with unmistakable evidences of “The
Progress of Democraeyv” in America, an

other speaker vividly portrays. “Phe
Death Knell of Militarism in) Ger
many.” And while one speaker tollow

“The Daniel Boone ‘Frail, another de_
picts ‘Municipal Progress’ of the las’
half century. Although eight of th
speakers dealt either directly or indi
rectly with questions relating to the
European War, yet each one of them
discussed entirely different phases ot
that stupendous conflict.

Before a large and apprectative audi
ence the Davidson Orchestra and Cilee
Club on Saturday evening gave one o
the mast interesting and entertaining
concerts of the year. Flavings just re-
turned from a week's tour to other col
leges. they were able to give an excep
tionally good program.  Encores three
times recalled the Quartet, composed of
Messrs. MecGeachy. Johnston. Ansley
and Fowle. ‘The individual solos bv
Messrs. Ansley and Fowle were grected
by merited applause. “Phe concluding
number by the Glee Club. ‘Davidson
For Aye,” was doubly interesting in that
it was composed by a member of the
club.

Despite the unfavorable weather a
goodly number of fair lassies from the
South Atlantic States gave a decided
social aspect to all the entertainments in
connecti¢n with the speaking exercises.
About fifty were present. Immediately
following the musical concert Saturday
evening all of the fraternities entertain-
ed their in their honor. Most of the
young ladies left on the Monday morn-
ing trains for their homes.
