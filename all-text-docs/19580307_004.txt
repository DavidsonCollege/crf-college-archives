Perhaps his chief outside in-

vision of market research sur-
veys, which are published under
the title 1958 (or whatever the
year of the current survey hap-
pens to be) Home Inventory,
Charlotte, N. C. (or whatever
the area surveyed is).

PROGNOSTICATIONS

Dr. Bevan’s first survey work
was a predictive survey of the
Taft-Ferguson Senate race in
Ohio. He explained that pro-
gressive polls, one dvery two
weeks, were taken Bntil two
weeks before the election, when
three polls were taken.

On a basis of the results of
these polls, the election was pre-
dicted within a .6°% margin of
error.

In Mecklenburg County in the
‘52 Eisenhower-Stevenson race,
a simifar’survey resulted in a
prediction that was off only .8%
for that county.

AS a consequence of this
work, Dr. Bevan has received
requests for similar surveys

from other corporations and oc-|

companies complaining that
their product was dealt with
unfairly. (They, naturally
showed poorly in the reports).

IFC Proposes
Pro Decorators

The Interfraternity Council has announced plans to
call in professional decorators to prepare the gymnasium
for this year’s Spring Frolics Dances.

Under the IFC proposal, the
plan would provide a change
from what one member called
“hanging the same paper on the
same wires for the last twenty
years.” There would be no in-
crease in dance ticket prices.

The _ professional - decorator
proposal is the latest in a series
of innovations effected by the
council during the past year.
Among others are the revised
Hell Week schedule and a plan
to hold Rush Week during next
year’s orientation period.

At its Wednesday night meet-
ing the group confirmed plans
for Hell Week, which will begin
on March 12 at 8 p.m. with
pledge-class skits in Chambérs
Auditorium. Hell Week activi-
ties will continue until mid-
night March 16 under IFC su-

pervision.

Further plans for Spring Fro-
lies are not yet complete, pend-
ing the conclusion of Hell Week
activities and fraternity initia-
tions. IFC members expressed
interest in an _ orchestra-ex-
change plan for Spring Frolics
similar to the arrangement with
V.P.I. which brought two or-
chestras instead of the usual
one to the campus for the re-
cent Mid-Winters dances.

Dance weekends will be held
at Washington and Lee dur.
ing Davidson’s Spring Frolics
weekend.

The group discussed declar-
ing the Saturday night dance!
completely informal and
abolishing the traditional Satur-|
day night intermission to serve
refreshments in the gym.

Q. “Do you think that the
main reason for this increase in
enrollment was to help ath-
letics?”

A. “No, ums ts not the motive.
The alumni of Davidson College

SOUND POLICY

Surveying the situation at Da-

vidson generally, in respect to

‘athletics. Coach Dole said that

“If you coach at Davidson Col-
lege, you have to readjust your
whole philosophy of athletics.”

He explained that practice
sessions are scheduled around
academic requirements, such as
labs, ete.

Coaches in other schools
have commented to Dole to
the effect thet in view of
the emphasis on academic
requirements they don’t see
how he fields a team at
all.

Summarized Dole: “We have
a healthy situation here at Da-
vidson. We don't expect champ:
