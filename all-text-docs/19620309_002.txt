B Plus For Improvement

The recent meeting of the faculty
produced some very happy and sig-
nificant changes in the Davidson cur-
riculum.

Some of the changes such as the
optional year of advanced physics for
pre-meds and the change in Music
41-42 will make these courses avail-
able to a larger number of students.
The one-semester music course will be
offered both semesters, making it
easier for students to work the course
into their elective schedules. The
change in the pre-med major will
make it easier to work in the advanc-
ed physics which is increasingly need-
ed without over-taxing the already
heavily loaded pre-med schedule.

The introduction of the basic
calculus course for freshmen is an-
other development in the math depart-
ment’s long and _ carefully-studied
curriculum changes which have kept
the department in pace with the lat-
est developments in mathematics
teaching and the rapid changes in the
high school preparation of entering
freshmen.

The new accelerated course in
French meets the needs of both the
freshmen who have had preparation
in French and of upperclassmen who
are already proficient in one language
or who want rapid preparation in a
second language for graduate school.
Both this course and the introduction
of Italian into the curriculum reflect
the same progressive spirit in meeting.
the changing needs and preparation of
the students with a carefully tested
and planned use of the latest methods
that has long distinguished the math
department.

The extensive changes in the His-
tory curriculum are certainly welcome
and long overdue. The course in
Twentieth Century American History

No, Virginia

This past week the Virgiaia Su-
preme Court ruled that Prince Ed-
ward county is under no constitution-
al obligation to support public schools.
This was another disappointing chap-
ter in the story of struggle for equal
school facilities in that area of central
Virginia.

Three years ago the county aban-
doned its public school system to
avoid Supreme Court-ordered integra-
tion. Since that time white pupils have
been attending special private schools
by aid of state tuition grants, while
the county’s 1,700 Negro children
have gone without any schools.

Such a situation is deplorable.
Virginians are cutting off their nose
to save their face. The economic and
social problem of the Negroes, who
are a majority of the county’s popula-
tion, is only aggravated by the elim-
ination of educational opportunities.
What people will do to maintain. their
early 19th century concepts of racial
superiority and to keep from associat-
ing with those blacks! We will have
intermarriage they shout.

Perhaps the most discouraging ‘
aspect of this week’s move was the
reaction of Virginia’s new governor

Albertis S. Harrison. The Byrdman
reported he was “gratified” by the
court's ruling.

has been expanded to two semesters.
History 53 will combine three of Dean
Johnston’s courses in Nineteenth
Century America. The advantage of
both these changes lies not only in
the elimination of unnecessary over-
lapping but, chiefly, in the fact that
these courses will now be offered
every year, thereby solving many of
the history major’s scheduling prob-
lems. Prof. Marrotte’s new course in
Asian politics is a much-needed addi-
tion.

All of these changes reveal the
kind of perpetual revaluation of the
curriculum with foresight and careful
planning which is necessary to keep
the course offerings up-to-date and in
tune with the aims of a liberal educa-
tion and the needs of the students.

The elimination of the Sopho-
more English for B.S. students reflects
in many ways the opposite of. this
ideal. Although the change is proba-
bly justified in its present context,
the fact that the English Department
has been forced to drop the course
indicates, we feel, a lack of the proper
foresight, planning, and intra-depart-
mental cooperation in bringing about
the necessary changes in the curricu-
lum. It is not enough to decide that it
would be nice to have a course and
write it in the catalogue. The purpose,
nature and substance of the course
must be carefully worked out in ad-
vance and integrated into the whole
of the department’s curriculum.

The English Department should
be commended for dropping a course
it considers ineffective. The move,
however, calls for further revamping
of the ceurses, particularly in the light
of the Interdepartmental Humanities
course, perhaps a reconsideration of
the whole English curriculum. '

The race dispute now returns to
the U. S. District Court. Meanwhile
the prospects are bleak for schools
next September. Nevertheless, the
State constitution continues to require
that the legislature establish and
maintain an efficient system of pub-
lic schools throughout the common-
wealth.

What does the legislature think
of this? Concluding its annual session
in Richmond this week, the members
generally applauded the decision. Dur-
ing the session there was one whisper
in favor of reopened schools. The
proposal for a state budget appropria-
tion was quickly defeated.

The right of all people to a public
education found an early champion
in America in Thomas Jefferson,
whom all Virginians continue to adu-
late. Whether one favors or opposes
integration (and we see this as im-
Material in the light of the U. S. Su-
preme Court ruling), this long-estab-

lished principle of a public education.

available to all still remains. Gov.
Harrison and his legislature seem to
have forgotten this, or else find it very
easy to violate the constitution under
which they serve for the sake of nar-
row-minded prejudice against people
of as great or greater individual
worth.

How About Huntley-Brinkley?

For several months the Union
Roundtable Committee has sponsored
a “review of the news” each Monday
night in the Union Lobby. Several
faculty members have passed the job
around, and have drawn fairly good
crowds at these half-hour sessions.

_ Students who attend these ses-
sions regularly have heard discussed
such issues as the admittance of Red
China to the UN, the impact of the
Common Market on the U.S. economy,
and the visit of Dean Rusk to David-
son. Roundtable Committee chairman
Dave Gilmour has done a good job in
finding a wide range of speakers from
the campus, representing the Econom-
ics, English, Philosophy, and even
Biology departments.

We are glad to see student re-

sponse, which is promisiug. We expect
that one reason is the informality of
the sessions, which are usually limited
to a half-hour each. We hope there
will continue to be interest in the
discussion of vital, timely topics. A
suggestion to Gilmour and the Round-
table Committee: how about expand-
ing the program by asking a few out-
siders to speak?

We think reporters from the
Charlotte Observer or News, or com-
mentators from Charlotte radio and
TV stations would be glad to come
out, have supper on campus, and hold
a short program in the Union. It would
help to give a wider slant on issues,
to the profit of the student body and
to the continued improvement of a

good program.

Delegate States Opinion
Of N. S. A. Conference

BY JOHN SPRATT

Davidsonian Steff Writer

The Student Council joined
NSA last spring in an avowed
attempt to lift the foggy pro-
vincialism that pervades the
whole can.,,us. The Council gen-
erally agreed, however, to wade
slowly into the association. That
way both desirable and objec-
tionable could be determined
from first-hand accounts, con-
ferences, organizational litera-
ture, ete.

Dean Burts and I took part in
one of these “first-hand ac-
counts” two weeks ago in a con-
ference on Academic Freedom
at Duke. I bring back to this
column only my personal opin-
ions and conclusions.

A former editor of the stud-
ent ‘newspaper at the Univer-
sity of Michigan kevnoted the
morning session with an ad-
dress on in foco parentis. He
was sharp-and brisk, so m:ch
so, in fact, that the rest of the
meeting was rather anti-cli-
matic. Starting with the uni-
versity presidents, he worked
his way through the profes-
sors down to the  lowliest
amoeba of a student, outlining
his visions for the ideal uni-
versity.

In the end, he had created an
institution devoid of any ¢on-
trol, featuring totally unfetter-
ed freedom. He bemoaned the
shameful fact that a person sells
away his freedom.when entering
a university, serving for four
years as an indentured lackey.

The proverbial old Dav:ds:ti
quip. “You knew it was Vke
this when you came heve.” was
satirized to shreds. “In that
case,” said the chairman. ‘our

only choice is which university

‘shall we be subservient to.”

The evening session turned
inevitably to one of NSA’s foster
children, the Southern Protest
Movement... a collective noun
for the more vernacular terms,
sit-in strikes, freedom riders,
etc. I was able to glean from
this symposium a few salient
facts about the groupleaders’
views on race relations.

Integration by itself won't
work. In fact, to end discrim-

ination, discrimination will
have to be counter-aimed
against whites. This will even-
tually “establish a “natural”
equilibrium.

From all this and too much
more to mention. I drew two
personal conclusions:

1.) That things at Davidson
weren't actually as bad as at
the other collezes represented,
and 2.) That those things that
are in anestionable shane are
subject to the whims of the
gods; and what NSA says,
thinks, or does will have little
effect on the adamant Executive
Committee, et al.

The only area left, there-
fore, is that of broadening
student opinion, somehow
charming out of apathy the
student body‘s latent talents.
Whether in agreement or dis-
agreement, NSA can give
campus opinions a thorough
grooming.

Ilowever, NSA will serve lit-
tle purpose in launching quixo-
tic beachheads on ridiculous is-
lands or in elbowing its, way
down crowded streets of opin-
ion. And Davidson College must
respond.

This may be unfeasible from

both sides. The Council will
have to decide that again this
fall.

Outline
Of USNSA

The U.S. National Student As-
sociation, of which Davidson is
currently a member, was con-
ceived in the minds of 25 stud-
ents who attended the World
Student Congress in Prague
right after World War I. In
1947, at the University of Wis-
consin campus, delegates from
356 schools met. wrote the con-
stitution for the USNSA. chose
its name, and decided on the
basis of its representation.

It was decided that the demo-
cratically elected student gov-
ernments on the various cam-
puses were to be that basis. But
it should be noted that through
these governments every stud-
ent of the college or. university
is, in fact, a member.

{t is this fact that must be
kept in mind when we read
President John Kennedy’s
statement, “The National
Student Association has splen-
didly articulated our nation-
al ideals and reflected the
vigor of our college and uni:
versity young people.”

Thus, when our delegate(s),
along with those from approxi-
mately 400 other schools, attend
the annual National Student
Congress this summer, their
decisions will starid as represen-
tative of the majority of all the
college students in the nation.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Sociological Scott Girl
Hits Informal Weekend

Ferris

Dear Editor:

Several weeks ago we read
with amusement the editorial
from a DAVIDSONIAN of 1921,
calling the “true southern gen-
tlemen” to defend “the Ameri-
can standatd of clean manhood
and pure womanhood.”

1 don’t think this article is
nearly as ridiculous as it first
appears. It points out a myth
which hovers today over stud-
ent life at Davidson. This is the
myth of Davidson's “Christian
Gentlemen.”

This ideal, if it ever existed,
is now gone. The only people
who continue to believe in it
are the faculty and trustees.

They look upon Davidson as
a garden which, if fertilized
properly, will produce the ex-
pected fruits, ie. the “Christian
Gentleman.”

The student here is nurtured
through four years of required
chapel and vespers in hopes he
will emerge as some sort of
“Bible-toting” individual (1 use
the word with restrictions) who
will tread the narrow path of
virtue in life.

The gentlemanly aspects
are carefully developed by the
gardeners. Students develop
in an allwhite environment.
This prevents any sort of con-
tamination from inferior

breeds. Of course, as Gentle-

men, we must occasionaliy
condescend to help the Ne-
groes. But only occasionally.

This “garden plan” might suc-
ceed if students could be expect-
ed to respond to a given stimu-
lus with a given response. Un-
fortunately, this is not the case.

What is happening is that we
do not really care about your
“Christian Gentleman.” The few
who care are so repulsed at the
means used to promote the ideal
that they turn from it with
disgust.

Perhaps it might be a good
idea to let the student decide
for himself whether he wants
to attend a church service or
sit beside a Negro in his class.

Dear Editor:
I have attended a number of
Davidson dance weekends and

PRANL IS

have noticed their increasing
informality. I understand that
your student body is discussing
whether to continue the present
trend or to go back to the for-
mal and semi-formal dances
with informal after-dance part-
ies.
- | would like to contribute
a girl’s point of view. From
a sociological standpoint, rit-
val or formality gives import-
ance to an occasion. The for-
mal and semi-formal dances
at Davidson in past years have
added excitement and en-
thusiesm to the dance week-
ends, not to mention variety.
The after-dance parties were
more fun because of the con-
trast with the formal dances.
Now the thought of skirts and
sweaters and rock ‘n roll all
weekend makes a girl wonder if
it is worth train or plane fare.
She might as well wait until
she can get a ride, she has less
work to do, or her date can
visit her.

Casual P. 0. Conversation
Has Typical Grave Issues

BY BOB IVEY
Davidsonion Steff Writer

They were standing in front of the post office, I be-
lieve—two typical Davidson students, on this cold, over-
cast day in March, analyzing issues of grave and sig-
nificant import. These men were intellectuals to be sure,
identified by their complexity of conversation and their
casualness of dress.

It had been said before that “great mids work to
gether,” but here was the supreme example. ese boys
were not brothers, not roommates, possibly only frater-
nity brothers, and yet as they stood there one could
easily observe the similarity of their thinking—manifest- |
ed by the amazing resemblance of their dress: white
ducks, weejuns, no socks, madras shirts, shirt-tails out,
and a sweater neatly and casually wrapped around their
necks.

INTELLECT SHOWN

Their conversation further exemplified their in-
tellect by their abilities to make rational analysis of pre-
vailing campus situations: The less reticent of the two
began:

“ ‘Ja hear that we won the vote on Spring Frolics?”

“Yeah,” replied the other—succinct, pertinent, lucid.

“Just think—more good loud guitars and drums. All
night long. Nothing but loud yelling and a good beat.
Great music. ‘Like we had Midwinters—Otis, Johnny, and
Buster—goshi, they were wunnerful.”

And, once again, that thought-provoking assertion
of agreement, ‘‘Yeah.”

BOYCOTT POWER

“ ‘Course, we were a cinch to win the vote this time
—’specially after so many of us pulled out on everybody
at Homecoming. Golly, they really must’ve missed us.
But what'd they expect—‘us’ staying around for those
cornball Four Aces and Ralph Flannagan and alli? Lotsa
luck. Whoever heard of them anyway?”

As the other agreed, the first went on to state the
obvious and sound reasoning that if our parents had ever
heard of them, then we surely don’t want them.

He continued, “Also heard that we’re gonna get the
loudest band in North Carolina for our after-party.
Doesn’t matter how they sound, as long as it’s loud. Gosh,
it should be just as great as the dance if they’re drunk
enough. That’ll be some great. Long and loud—all night
long. it there's anything I can’t stand, it’s variety.”

tt} ea aad

VERBAL POWER

“We were sure to get that rock and roll thing pushed
through this time. Say it just right and everybody’ll vote
like you want ’em to. One of the IFC guys in a borderline
fraternity said he just asked his fraternity whether they’d
rather have ‘the Coasters, or some dance band you never
heard of?’. Even the guys who do like a little variety
couldn’t vote but one way on that! And there’s no prob-
lem with some of these fraternities; they know that if
they’re gonna be ‘good guys’ like us, they’ve gotta vote
for rock and roll. It wouldn’t look sharp for them to vote
the other way.”

“Yeah.”

“This show those other colleges what Davidson’s
made of, No more coats and ties for us. The grubbier the
better. I told my date Midwinters that if she just had to
dress up for something, she could just get up and go to.
church Sunday, Ha ha ha.”

“Yeah, Ha ha.”

“ ‘Course we didn’t get the Coasters, but you know
who we are having. Gosh, I can’t wait to go home and tell
everybody that we had the real Dakota Station for Spring
Frolics. She does sing rock and roll, doesn't she? Do you
know about the concert? Lester and Earl! They’re really
getting up to our level now. This is really some class.
This has Just gotta be a great weekend. Rock, rock, rock
—loud and long—grubby clothes— the whole weekend—
wow. And we'll prob’ly get ’em to have them like this
from now on. Great.”

“Yeah, From now on. Great.”

Taejon Math Teacher
States Financial Need

BY J. P. CAMERON
Mathematics Department
Taejon College

President John Talmage of
Taejon College has already
written the official letter of ap-
preciation to the Davidson stud-
ent body and faculty for the gift
of money which has been pre-
sented to our college. I do not
believe that anyone there at
Davidson can actually realize
how very timely this gift is.

Our mission is in serious fi-
nancial difficulties, causing the
college to face a budget cut in
the coming fiscal year. In my
opinion, the budget is unrealis-
tically low anyway. This not-
withstanding, we are at present
desperately trying to equip a
chemistry laboratory to meet
the needs of seniors who are
majoring in that subject.

KOREAN SITUATION

Let me try to give you a fair
picture of our situation here in
Korea. In the first place, the
aim of the college is to educate
Christian men and women who
will be able to take places of
leadership in Korean society,
and as such, be effective Chris

vocations.

In this day, the Korean young
people as well as the youth of
other countries of Asia are .
striying mightily to become edu-
cated in all fields, especially in
science. For too long, many
people in America have thought
of the “mission field” as a place
where a missionary ministers to
half-dressed, half-civilized peo-
ple. Of course in some areas
this is true, but not in Korea.

INTELLIGENT PEOPLE

The Koreans are highly in-
telligent, highly civilized pco-
ple, extremely ambitious to com-
pete in the world as a modern
nation. It is true that the coun:
try is plagued with poverty and
unemployment, but vast im-
provements have been made
since the so-called Korean War.

In light of all this, you can
see how vitally useful your Dav-
idson gift will be to us. At this
very moment Dr. Robert Goette.
head of our Chemistry Depart-
ment, is in Japan buying lab
equipment with your money.
Had your gift not come when it
did, we almost certainly would
not have graduated majors in

tian laymen in their various Chemistry this year.
