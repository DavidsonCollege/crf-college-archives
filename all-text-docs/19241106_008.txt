Saturday morning found an endrene
different campus at Davidson—very dif-
ferent from the one that was viewed by
students on the preceding Friday night.

The whole campus, from golf
to Main street, Was decorated with long
white streamers which suspended
from. trees, telephone buildings,
and the tank. The slight that

Good looks are not necessary

goes—well, many of our best

a long way, with every dollar
doing its duty.

arise and

came out to hear Dr. Thompson speak on
the subject “Mullest: Fellowship.

After the quartet had sung / Know the
Lord Has Laid His Hands On Me, Dr.
Thompson read Matthew's description of
“Christ in the Garden” and continued his

discussion of friendship with Christ by say- |
ing
what he has done for us, but also because of |
what we can do for him.” He said, “Christ
took the disciples into the garden with’ Him
because He needed them. [couldn't
Jesus if [ meant nothing to Him.”
The big message of the evening pointed to
a deepened friendship with Christ throvgi |
a thutual service. Christ seemed to say to
His disciples, when the approaching cruci- ,
fixion caused the uncertain, half-curious fol- |
lowers, the crowd, to fall away, “Surely men,
you're not going to leave me, [ need vou.’
In the garden, He says, “Tt need to think that \
you are here with me.” And then, “What, |
could you not help me one hour ?” a

To the question, “Can I do anything for |
Christ?” comes the answer, “Ye are my wit- |
nesses, 1 depend on you.” Dr. Thomps. n|
said that was a challenge to every Christian |
to help complete the work of Christ. Christ's |
suffering is a complete work only as
serve Him. Paul said,
Him.” The challenge as set forth by
Thompson was, “Come and suffer:
if we love Him.”

Warning was sounded against condemning
ourselves too harshly if we didn't always feel
at the height of surging joy in our love for
Christ. “Do not look in your heart for
love,” said the speaker, “for then you take |
yourself off the object. Just look at Him
if you want to find that you love Him.”

Finally, Christ calls for our selves because
jof what He is Himself, : |
has done for us, and because of what we
can do for Him. If would have the
fullest fellowship with Christ we must seek
it through mutual service,
mutual love.

The house bowed in prayer and the quartet
