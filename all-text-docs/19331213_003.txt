Dr. Thomas Cook Leads
Y.M.C.A. Sunday Vesper

Rev. Thomas Cook, pastor of the
Second Presbyterian Church of Salis-
bury, was the speaker at the Y. M.
C, A. vesper service last Sunday night.
Hugh Hawkins, who had charge of
the service, read the scripture from
John 12:20-26. Bob Smith and Ed
Humphries then led the audience in
prayer.

Mrs. G. R. Vowles, accompanied by
the organ, sang “A Clean Heart,” after
which Hugh Hawkins introduced the
speaker of the evening.

Rev. Mr. Cook put the emphasis of
his address on the 24th verse of the
scripture: “Except a grain of wheat
fall into the earth and die, it abideth
by itself alone; but if it die, it bear-
eth much fruit.”

Rey. Cook compared a man’s life
to the only grain of wheat in the world.
There are four things that we could
do with the grain: We could destroy
it, could consume it, could
hoard it, or we could plant it. Any one
of the first three of these things would
be foolish and unprofitable. The last
plan is the only wise one.

If the grain were planted and al-
lowed to die in the earth, soon it would ©
forth and 60 grains of

3y repeating this process,
enough wheat to feed the world could
soon be grown.

we we

wheat.

In a like manner, we can destroy,
consume, or hoard our lives, but the
wise man will give his life in- self-
forgetful service. He will let his own
life die by forgetting it while leading
others to Christ, and in turn, his life
will blossom forth.

“Tf you let your life die in self-for-
getful service, it will bring forth much
fruit,” Cook coneluded.

The service was closed by a hymn,
and the benediction by Dr. Moffett.
