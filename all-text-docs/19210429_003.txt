Last Thursday night the walls of the
Phi Society iairly vibrated to the aricu-
mentation of John Poteat and the ora:
tory of Ralph Freeman. These orators
together with their colleagues held the
acdience spellbound throughout the lit-
erary part of the program.

The query for the regular debate was
‘Resolved. That the German indemnity
should he reduced hy half.” Debating
this subject were J. L. McLean. S. R.
Sloan and H. K. Russell, on the afftema-
tive: Iohn Poteat, H. A. Hill, and F. S.
Johnson, upheld the negative.

The arguments presented by the af-
firmative were that the present indem-
nity is uniair to the German people;
that Germany is absolutely unable to pay
as required by the terms of the treaty;
that if there is a bankrupt Germany
there will also be a Bolshevistic Ger-
many to deal with.

I nopposition to these points the nega-
tive upheld their side of the question
with the following points: First, that
Germany can pay in full if we give her
time and open up trade relations with
her; second, that this heavy indemnity is

Mr Julian S, Miller, of The Charlotre

Association, was held in Charlotte due
to the inelemeney of the weather.

Following Professor Currie. Mr. J. O.
Faulkner, former cditor of the Ring
Tum Phi, of Washington and Lee Uni»
versity, spoke. Tle made a very inter-
esting and instructive talk on “The Out-
side and Inside of a College Newspaper.”
In his talk he diseussed the makerup,
divisions, symmetry, and positions of
ditierent heads in the paper. Quite a bit
of stress was laid upon the editorial
section. In a college newspaper the

‘editorial is a powertul iactor since it re:

produces the feeling and spirit of the
entire student body. Flence it is seen
that 4 great responsibility rests upon

mouthpiece of the surdents. Mr. Faulk-
ner closed his address by urging anyone
talented in journalism to follow this
talent up. as journalism ofiers a very
wide tteld.
Aticer a few announcements by Mr.
Weathers, the meeting was adjonrned.
