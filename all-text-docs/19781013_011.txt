Harriers undaunted

by recent setback

«By JEFF HAMILTON
Staff W:

Despite solid performances
by many members of the cross-
country team, Davidson's run-
ners were badly mauled by
visiting teams Furman (16-50),
Appalachian State (18-41) and
The Citadel (21-34). The sole
victory was over UT-Chatta-

nooga who brought only two
runners.

The course record was broken
by Bob Gray running unofficial-
ly in 31:29 as three other

pointer.
The defense got more points
on the board when Landis Wade

intercepted a pass and returned |

it into the end zone on a 40-yard
run.

Davidson's scoring ended
with a 79-yard run by David
Barnard. This run came on his
first play of the game.

Davidson Head Coach Ed
Farrel} had praise for his de-
fense by saying, “I can’t re-
member when I have had a de-
fensive team score two touch-
downs in.a game. But that’s
what we got against Randolph-
Macon and it helped turn the
game around. The offense was
sluggish until the defense got us
some points. Overall, the de-
fense performed well.”’

Wildcat Alvin Atkinson ac-
counted for the two other Da-
vidson touchdowns. His first
score of the afternoon came
from two yards out, and he
scored another TD on a five
yard run. Mike Bass converted
his extra point attempts.

+ Coming off a win over Dela-
ware last weekend, Lehigh will
present a formidable opponent
for the ‘Cats this Saturday.
Farrell says that Lehigh’s wide
receiver Steve Kreider is one‘of
the best athletes that the team
will face ail year.

He added, “We will have to
be at our very best‘ physically
and emotionally for them.”

Clemson stalemated

Cattes maul Wake

By BELLE ERDMAN
Staff Writer

The Davidson field hockey
team exhibited excellent team
play last week as they over-
whelmed Wake Forest by a 5-0
score.

Each goal was contributed by
a different team member. Lisa
Ballantyne, Cathy Inabnet,
Kirk Cameron, Margaret Her-
man, and Jamie Watt were all

aggressive in the circle, and

each added a point towards the
victory.

The defense appeared unstop-
pable. Cindy Curtis admitted,
“It was important for us to

come back from the loss last:

week to Chapel Hill. We went
into it with a positive attitude
and it paid off.”

Last Tueeday’s contest ag-
ainst Clemson was the team’s
first on the road; Davidson
found the Tigers much ini-

proved over last year.

Employing the peychological
art of “coming from behind”
learned earlier in the season, the
Cats scored near the end to tie
‘the game 2-2. The goals were
contributed by Kirk Cameron
and Lisa .

Mary Grey Gilchrist, how-
ever, displayed great stickwotk
as she skillfully avoided the
Clemson opponents: Clemson
tried to counter Davidson’s

‘stingy defense with a unique
offensive line-up which at first
proved a bit deceptive.

Presently the field hockey
record stands at 3-1-1, with the
team averaging about two goals
per game; Lisa Ballantyne leads
the scoring with an average of
one goal a game.

This weekend the team leaves
for a road trip to Duke and East
Carolina and then meet Win-
throp on Monday.
