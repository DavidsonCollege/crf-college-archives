THE THURSDAY GAME. |

Vhe only reason that basket ball has
not played a more prominent. part. in
Davidson athletics in the past has been
the lack of fldor space and cquipment.
We have not suffered for lack of ma-
terial to make winning teams. “The main
obstacle at Davidson is generally money,
not men, and the men always go to the
limit of the money.

This year, with an improvement in
the basket ball floor more interest has
been taken in’ the indoor game. ‘The
first trip of the team was not entirely
successful from the standpoint of games
won, but every game was hotly and
closely contested, and a good start was
made. Another trip is being planned inv
the near future.

‘Tomorrow we face a strong oppon
ent on our own floor. ‘Vhis is the first
game with an outside team that we have
had here for three years. “Phe Davidson
team has worked hard to round into
shape, and we owe it to them as well as
to the “Davidson Spirit’ to attend this
game and give it the whole-hearted and
enthusiastic support which we give the
foot ball and base ball teams.

‘Let us have a “triple alliance’ of
basket ball, foot ball and base ball vie-
tories this year.

LIFE WORK.

According to the statistics gathered by
Tre Davivsontan fast fall, 158 of the
students enrolled at Davidson have de-
cided what calling or profession they
expect to enter. The remaining 150
have either not decided or are delaying
a definite decision.

When none of the professions were
crowded and a man of ordinarily good
education could be successful in most any
one, the question of a young man’ s life
work was not as perplexing as it is to-
dav. Every modern ficld of work is
calling only for the best. ‘This increases
the importance of carefully weighing the
opportenities of the various callings and
their different demands upon the powers
and talents that a map may possess.

The serics that_is now beginning in
the Y. M. C. A. Thursday night meet-
ings should therefore be of special inter-
est to every man. Each of the leading
subjects of life work will be taken up
and discussed briefly by fellow students
who have definitely chosen their life
work. In this way the claims of law.
medicine, teaching, business, ministry,
will be laid before us, and. the oppor-|,
tunities for Christian service in each
shown,

Here is a great opportunity. Let us
attend the meetings and be better pre-
pared to face the eternal question of
voung American manhood: “What am
T to do after college? Where can I best

put my life?”

ARE YOU GUILTY?

One. of the most maddening things te
every one except the guilty party, is the:

growing frequency with which items are |

heing clipped .from the newspapers in
the reading room. We would venture
to assert that hardly twenty men are
ever guilty of such a breach of library
courtesy, but nevertheless these twenty
are constantly bringing upon themselves
any but benevolent thoughts of the re-
maining users of the reading reom, and
it is for them that-‘these words are meant.
It may be only a local item from a home
Newspaper, or it may be an important
half-column of social or athletic news—
the mere absence of it from the paper
makes all the following readers anxious
to know what is missing, besides depriv-
ing some of something that may have
been of special interest or value to them.

Let us correct this evil ourselves, and
not make necessarv the imposition of a
library rule which will take from the
reading room for a dav any paper which
has heen clipped the day before.

SAYAD RECEIVES GOOD NEWS.

For some time Davidson's Persian
student, William Savad, has been in ter-
rible suspense in regard to the safety
of his mother and relatives in his home
town of Urumiah, Persia, on account of
the raid upon that place by the fierce
Kurds from the surrounding mountains.
who were in conjunction with — the
Turks. “The Kurds being Mohanimed-
ans, are especially hostile to Christians,
and Savad feared that all his relatives
had been massacred by them; but no
definite news could be obtained. ‘The
following telegram from — Secretary
Bevan brought great relief:

“From Consul at Tabriz indicates
Americans at Urumiah safe and native
Christians unmolsted.”

A later telegram from ai cousin of
Sayad in New Fingland. states that all
his people are safe in Tiflis, Russia.

The Davidson ctudent hody deeply
sympathized with Sayad in his suspense.
and is happy as well as he over the good
news. :

NEW “MOVIE” FEATURES,

*Manager Shaw, of the base ball team,
and Manager Faw, of the Annual, are
planning many new features for the
more cflicient operation of the “movies,
which, in the future, will he open every
‘Tuesday and Saturday night. As an
inducement to scholarship among — the
students of the Davidson public schools
a free ticket to the Saturday night show
will be given cath week to that student
of each grade who does the best work
during the preceding week. A new film
company has been given the contract for
furnishing all the films used during the
remainder of the.vear, which, as in the
past, will be of the best. If possible a’
least one fila, showing scenes from. the
European war, will be presented eacl
week,
