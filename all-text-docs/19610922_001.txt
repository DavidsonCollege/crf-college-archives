Martin Cool Toward Plan

For Joint Medical Program’

BY BILL GODWIN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

President Martin this week all but closed the door
on a suggestion by a former dean of Duke University’s
Medical School that Davidson College collaborate with
Memorial and Presbyterian hospitals in Charlotte on a

four-year medical college.

“There is no question,” Dr.
Martin said, “but that there
would be a real conflict with our
liberal arts program here.”

The suggestion came from Dr.
W. C. Davison in a late-June
civic club address at Charlotte.
A trustee of Duke Endowment—
Davidson's greatest benefactor—
and a former member of our
board of visitors, Dr. Davison
is described by Dr. Martin as
“a very strong booster of David-
son as a pre-medical preparation
place.

“1 think it’s a compliment to
the college that he included us
in his plans.”

Dr. Davison said the medical
college would be “an economical
way to increase the flow of
M.D.’s in North Carolina.”

He proposed that Davidson
have charge of students in their
first two years of graduate work,
then turn them over to the
Charlotte hospitals for the re-
maining two years.

“Davidson could do a wonder-
ful job with the first two years
of medical preparation,” he
said. “Your professors are en-
tirely capable of handling this
advanced work.”

In Charlotte, he said, adequate
facilities exist at the two hospi-
tals and “plenty of federal
money” would be at their dis-

posal.”

Council
Evaluates
Activities

In its first quorum meeting of
the school year, the Student
Council announced its “pres-
ent major emphasis” as a “re-
evaluation of the student ac-
tivities.”

President George Trask rec-
ommended the formation of a
committee to study the various
groups on campus with an eye
towards the cutting out of dead
wood and a more positive utili-
zation of potential. ~

Appointed to the committee
were Student Council members
John Spratt and Larry Leafer.
A third member from the stud-
ent body at large will be ap-
pointed by President Trask.

First order of business was
the formal inauguration of
George Trask as president of
the student body by first vice-
president Ken Kelly.

The council voted to reinstate
an important committee which
was allowed to lapse last spring.
This was the finance committee,

uate medical school
lotte and Dr. Martin said that
Charlotteans are “very interest-|
ed in some kind of medicai col: |
lege.” |

The president described a |

medical college as “terribly ex- |
pensive,” pointing out that Dav: |
idson annually turns out about |
25 per cent of its graduates with
pre-medical B. S. degrees.

“This seems,” he said, “to be |
a good percentage for Davidson |
to produce—a good contribution
to the medical profession by the
college.”

In June and at the present,
Dr. Martin said, “1 am not of
the opinion that Davidson can
afford to transfer the amount
of its attention and resources to |
make a medical college success-
ful and, at the same time, main-
tain a top-rate liberal arts pro-
gram.” :

He reiterated Davidson's goal |
to be “the finest college of its
type (1,000 male students,
church related, liberal arts) in
America.”

“If someone were to approach
us and say, ‘We'll provide the
money,’ then, .of course, we'd
have to look at the suggestion
from a different standpoint,”
Dr. Martin said. “Still, perhaps,
there would be a conflict,”

When Duke Endowment
trustees met with Davidson of.
j ficials here this spring, “I spoke
| with Dr. Davison on the subject
{of a medical college,” Dr. Mar-
tin said. “However, I made no
|committments and showed no
| real enthusiasm.”

offerel an M. A. pre-medicai de-
gree. A medical college jointly
sponsored by Davidson flourish-
ed off-campus here at the turn
of the century.

Dr. Davison said his proposal
would be “a lot less expensive”
than establishing new two-year
or four-year medical colleges in
the Charlotte area.

In the late 1920's, Davidson | ,,oveq a recommendation for

the interdepartmental program
last spring, and a six-man team
was chosen to plan and develop
the first year’s course.

The members of the team,
representing different branches
of the liberal arts, are Dr.
George L. Abernethy, philoso-
phy; Dr. Richard G. Cole, Eng-
lish; Dr. George Labban, class-
ies; Dr. John A. McGeachy, his-
tory; Dr. Max E. Polley, Bible;
and Dr. Daniel D. Rhodes, relig-
ion and philosophy.

Dr. Rhodes, serving as a
spokesman for the group, said
that during the summer the
group had to determine the ob-
jectives of the course and in the
light of the objectives, had to
organize an outline and deter-
mine what source materials and
teaching methods would be
used.

TOTAL PICTURE

As to the main objective of
the course, Dr. Rhodes said, ‘““We
see a problem that exists in cur-
rent education; namely, the
fragmentizing of knowledge.
Our objective would be to go
against this and try to present
the achievements and life of
Western man in something of a
total picture.

“We believe we can accom-
plish this by following the his-
torical pattern. History will pro-
vide a framework within which
religion, philosophy, art, litera-
ture, etc. will be examined.”

The team has divided the first
year’s work into five periods of

PRIMARY MATERIAL

Dr. Rhodes said that they hope
to let each period speak for it-
self. Therefore, primary mater-
ial, or material actually written
in the particular period being
studied, will be used.

He stated that while history
will serve as a framework for
examining the humanities with-
in a particular period, great em-
phasis will also be placed on
some themes that are common
to all peoples of all periods, He
gave as examples such recurring
themes as the problem of human
suffering, the epic theme, and
the theme of the good life. He
feels that these recurring
themes will tend to integrate
the course.

Dr. Rhodes continued, saying,
“Two teaching methods will be
combined in this program: lec-
ture and discussion. When the
material demands a lecture, the
member of the team best quali-
fied will speak to the entire
group of students. Whenever
discussion is possible, each team
member will meet with his
group of fifteen to eighteen
students for that purpose.”

During this year, according to

“We are looking forward to

the team’s advisor. Nine mem-

Endowment Ca

Will Use Region Plan

BY TOM
Davidsonian

LOFLIN
Staff Writer

Why is the Living Endowment Fund so necessary to
the life of Davidson College? Almost one half that the

, college spends to educate a student comes from personal

gifts. Yet only thirty per cent of the alumni of the college

gave to the fund last year.

The low percentage of gifts
has prompted the necessity for
a new approach to the Living
Endowment this year. Robert
Sailstad, assistant to the presi-
dent, believes that this year the
college has found a method that
could result in fifty per cent of
the alumni contributing to the
fund.

The plan that will be used is
based on the fact that, with all
of the requests made of a per-
son today, there is nothing as
effective as a personal appeal
from a fellow alumnus.

Approximately fifty regions
have been established through-
out this country, with a chair-
man for each one. The regional
chairman will secure, if possi-
ble, one worker for every five
alumni to be solicited for the
fund.

The time period for the Fund
has also been changed this year.
instead of beginning in January
and ending in December, a fis-
cal year beginning and ending
in June has been established.
The new schedule will enable
the regional solicitation to work
more effectively.

The Living Endowment Fund
program will also use mail go-
licitation by class agents, as it
has done since 1939. Regional
solicitation will be carried out
in October and November;
after which, class agents will

write to each member of his
class who did not give during
the first phase of the program.

Beginning with the Class of
‘05, each class will have a class
agent. An advance guard mem-
ber will take care of the letter-
writing to alumni who graduat-
ed before 1905.

Each agent will compose his
own letter, sign it with his per-

sonal signature, and perhaps
add a postscript. The college
will then reproduce and mail

the letters in sufficient quantity
for the particular class.

The Living Endowment Fund
is not a building fund. It re-
mains a separate program to
solicate money for faculty sal-

aries, scholarships, equipment,
and other necessary items for
the operation of the college.

Anyone contributing may speci-
fy which area of education he
wishes his gift to be used for,
or he may give with the under-
standing that the college will
use his money in the area where
it is most needed.

This past weekend, Sept. 15-
16, the briefing session for class
agents and regional chairmen
was held here. Mr. Sailstad said
enthusiasm for Living Endow-
ment this year was higher than
he has ever seen it before. With
the aid of the new program, the
goal of $200,000 is expected to
be reached.
