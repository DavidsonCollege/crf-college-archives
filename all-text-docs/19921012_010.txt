The Spike Lee Film Review

Mo' Better Blues

By Chris Hoveland

Mo’ Better Blues isa passion-
ate story of arising musician
who, blinded by his greed for
success, gets himself in two
raunchy dead-end love-af-
fairs, anda nasty fight which
ends his career. He then must
deal with his losses, and sal-
vage some kind of purpose in
his life.

In view of Spike Lee’s
greatly anticipated arrival at
Davidson, this article will
concentrate on the issues he

- develops, and in the process,
try to tip-toe around the tech-
nical aspects of the film; note-
worthy as they may be. Two
themes which need attention
are: (1) the role of the indi- -
vidual and self-assertion, and
(2) the film’s emphasis on
race assertion. ~

“Bleck,” the film’s main char-
acter, is a trumpet player and leader
of “The Bleek Quartet,” a talented

jazz band on its way to financial
success. Bleek had been taught by

his mother that the way to make
something of himself was to prac-
tice hard on the trumpet.

The opening scene shows him
asa child fighting with his mother,
because all he wants to do is
go outside and play with his
boys. Ina following scene,
he’s in his twenties, and a
’ beautiful woman, Carter,
calls on him at his apart-
ment. He asks, “Do you
know what time it is? It’s
one o’clock. No one inter-
rupts me when I’m practic-
ing.”
One of his girlfriends,
: Carter, tells him she wants a
man who knows what he
wants. He responds by say-
ing that he does know what
he wants, and that his music
comes first. Meanwhile, he
fantasizes that while sitting
on top of the world, he can
maintain two promiscuous
relationships with no harm

done. It goes without saying that

She's Gotta Have It

By Sarah Sadowski

In his 1986 film, She’s Gotta
Have It, Spike Lee joins the cohort
of men who have,,for millennia,
wrestled with the issue of female
sexuality. Lee craftily confronts
the question through a cinemato-
graphically striking black and
white, documentary-style portrait
of the (sexual) life and times of
Nora Darling (Tracy Camilla
Johns), testified to by the film’s
central characters.

Nora, Brooklyn’s own sexu-
ally-insatiable Darling Nicki, is
crassly sketched by three of her
former lovers, the narcissistic

pretty-boy Greer Childs (John
Canada Terrell), the poetic, too-
good-to-be-true Jamie Overstreet
(Tommy Redmond Hicks), and the
clapping comic Mars Blackmon
(Spike Lee), as well as the lesbian
puruant-friend Opal Gilstrap (Raye
Dowell), the former roommate
Clorinda Bradford (Joie Lee), and
dear old dad (Bill Lee).

The lovers vent their vexation
over each’s been-done-wrong re-
lationship with Nora through de-
scriptive recollection of sex and
life with her. Each offered her a
Promised-land life, but the cruel
and unusual Nora simply treated

them as “three interchangeable
parts of a whole” (Greer Childs).
The tartuffian trinity wades through
its malevolent memory of Nora,
continuously circling back to the
climactic enigma of Nora’s insa-
tiable sex drive.

Nora loved “bonin’”, having
sex, and did it often in her shrine-
like bedroom bordello. She’s gotta
haveit. If she can’t getit(or doesn’t
want it) from one of her part-time
lovers, she healthfully engages in
sex-for-one, and is tempted by (but
never participates in) lesbian sexual

School Daze

By Rafael Candelario and
Travis Hinson
T- So Rafrod, what do you think
about School Daze; aside from the
sex?

R- I think that an important lesson
can be learned from this movie
just from the simple fact that it
addresses everyday issues in the
African-American/black commu-
nity.

T-I agree, and one major issue that
came up throughout the entire
movie was how we(black people)
judge each other by skin color. It’s

kind of unfortunate, but I know
some guys who would date only
light-skinned females. I myself
am a rainbow man.

R-Iknow what you sayin’ Rockon
that tip. But it seems so petty how
we let other cultures influence our
standard of beauty.

A word is just a word, but the
connotation of a word can be deva-
stating. For instance, the word
“BLACK...”

T-Ahhhh Sh....! Now you’re talk-
ing. Forsome African-Americans,
“BLACK” is more than justacolor,

its a state of mind. One that brings
about pride in being black. But for
others, it has become a negative
essence in their being. Society has
changed the meaning of this word
of beauty into a word of fear.

R-Yeah, like in the movie,Gamma
Phi Gamma and the Gamma Rays
tried almost to the best of their
ability to ignore their black-

ness, butat the sametime, Dap and —

the fellas need to concentrate more
on the problems at home before
taking care of other people’s dirty

A SPIKE LEE JOINT "ILS
Jungle Fever

By Mary McCrory and
Will Lazenby

Mary and I were instructed to
address the issues that Spike Lee
presents in Jungle Fever. To
acomplish this would take more
time and column space than either
of us have. The film is frothing
over with racism, sterotypes, an-
ger and addictions. The problems
of relationships between different
cultures and races are utilized to
create a dance of love and hate
between husband and wife, father
and daughter, father and son, and
blackand white: However, there is
a more pressing issue that per-
vades the whole film: the futility
of life. The entire movie is one big
depressing cycle where everyone
is headed for a fall.

We begin with Flipper
(Wesley Snipes), a black architect,
Starting an affair with his white
Italian secretary, Angela
(Annabella Sciorra). Flipper’s best
friend, Cyrus (Spike Lee), leaks

Flipper’s secret and choas ensues.
Flipper leaves his house and wife
to stay in an apartment with An-
gela.

Meanwhile, Gator (Samuel L.
Jackson), Flipper’s brother, (we
swear, these are really their names)
keeps hitting up Flipper and their
parents for money to support his
crack habit. The reverend doctor
patriarch of the family (Ossie
Davis) will have nothing to do
with Gator. But mom is still gen-
erous (and gullible) and always
coughs up some dough, naively
believing her little boy Gator will
Straighten up.

Now things getconfusing. Out
of Harlem and into Bensonhurst
we find Paulie (John Turturro),
Angela’s ex-fiance, falling in love
with a black woman. This occurs
right as Flipper has satisfied his
“curiosity” about white women and
heads home to the comfort of his

Do The Right Thing

By Katrice Shuler
Spike Lee’s 1989 release of
Do the Right Thing met with criti-
cism for his climatic riot scene, but
little

ters, Mookie (Spike Lee) and Sal
(Danny Aiello) struggle with con-
flicting ways todeal with demands
on them. The film also develops

begin the long road to respect.
