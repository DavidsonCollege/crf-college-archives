-Church and College:
Are they separate?

SGA decides president should be Presbyterian

By Apam HIckEy
Staff Writer

At the last SGA meeting on
Tuesday, October 3, Senators dis-
cussed and were polled on rules
which govern the religious affilia-
tion of religion professors, Trust-
ees, and the President. While the
SGA has no power over the issue,
it was President Bill Gullan’s goal
to get an idea of where the Senate
stands on the issue.

Currently the Constitution of
Davidson College mandates that
all religion professors and Trust-
ees be active members of a Chris-
tian church and that the President
of the college be an active Presby-
terian.

Gullan cautiously opened the
floor to debate, asking students to
“limit this to as little philosophiz-
ing as possible.” He stated that he
hoped that students would discuss
tangibles, rather than argue theory.

During the discussion that fol-
lowed most students simply ex-
pressed their personal views or the
opinions of their constituents on
the issue, on which the SGA has
passed three resolutions in the last
two years. Several Senators
seemed suprised that the school is
still officially affiliated with the
Presbyterian church.

Feelings on the issue were
sharply divided. Some, like Kelly
Cunningham of the Ecumenical
Council (who opposed the require-
ments on Trustees and Religion
professors), felt the affiliation with
the church to be “all pros and no
cons.” Others, such as Senator

Rick Onkey, were against the af-
filiation and all vestiges of it, call-
ing it “close minded,” and “of a
day gone by,” “an insult to non-
Christians.”

After roughly 30 minutes of

Sabel, our Homecoming Queen.

discussion Will Cowan motioned
to limit debate to three minutes, to
be followed by a vote. The motion
passed.

Senators expressed some con-
fusion over the purpose of the vote.
While Gullan stressed the infor-
mality of it, he had in the last
meeting. asked Senators to ques-
tion peers about the policy, imply-
ing to some a more formal pur-
pose.

While some representatives
thought they should simply vote
their consciences, others used a
pre-vote recess to caucus, aligning
their votes according toa perceived
distribution of student opinion.

Though discussion yielded a
myriad of opinions, the vote re-
flected something of a consensus.
The voting was done by roll call in
which each senator was asked to
answer the three questions being
debated. As tochanging the policy
to allow a non-Presbyterian Presi-
dent, 12 Senators voted “yes,” 18
voted “no,” and four abstained.
On the issues of removing the re-
strictions on the members of the
Board of Trustees and professors
of the religion department, both
votes yielded equal results: 30
voted to remove the restrictions,
two voted to keep them, and two
abstained. Gullan and Vice Presi-
dent Warren Buford abstained from
all three votes.

The issue'is far from resolved.
The results of this vote as well as
the other formal resolutions passed
on this subject by different bodies
will be relayed to the Board of
Trustees whichis expected to make
decisions on the policies during
their next meeting in February,
“This is not the first time, nor will
it be the last, that religious affilia-
tion is debated at Davidson,” says
Gullan.

Sabel wins Homecoming
Queen; court gets caught in
torrential downpour

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

“Tt was an exciting experience,
but I wish the rain could have held
off’ Homecoming Queen Allison
Sabel said about the half-time event
at Saturday’s football game. At
the game, eleven women and their
escorts filed on to the stage in front
of students, parents, profesors and
alumni in the stands. Yet dark
clouds and heavy rain attended the
event too, minutes before the last
representatives presented them-
selves to the crowd.

The women representing
Davidson’s three eating houses,
six fraternities, Black Student Coa-

lition and Independents introduced
themselves and their escorts by

name, hometownand major. Com-

prising the court were: Debbie
Liverman escorted by Wes Hart
from BSC, Lillian Montgomery
and J.D. DuPuy representing
Connor House, Julie Simmons and
Carl Rooke as Independants, Laura
Jefferson and Chris Harrison rep-
resenting the “distinguished gentle-
men” of KA, Chris Knox escorted
by Kappa Sigma member Burt
Arrington, Allison Sabel with Brian
Cole from Phi Delta Theta, Sue

- Rawlings and Jeff Fuller from Figi,

Jenny Rose and Eddie Gordon rep-
resenting Pika, Beth Lindsay and
Dave Thompson on behalf of the
“Wild Women” of Rusk, Jane

Stubbs and Dave Valentineras SAE
representatives, and Warner Hall
member Catherine Thompson es-
corted by Charles Barrus.

Unfortunately, the presenta-
tions were interrupted by the down-
pour, and much of the crowd sought
shelter from the torrents before
Sabel was announced as the Home-
coming Queen.

Many agreed that it is impos-
sible to predict the winner. As
Allison agrees, “It is a great honor
to be Homecoming Queen but ev-
eryone on the stage deserved to be
elected.”

She is thankful for the thrill-
ing, yet wet victory and would like
to shower thanks on Phi Delta Theta
for nominating her.
