Drake, Dave Hardeman and Tom
Poston. The fourth place, as yet
unfilled, is being vied for. by
four candidates.

Mrs. H. T. Lilly, coach of the
debaters, has stated that the
team is working hard and good

Margenau Speaks With Catching Zeal r

BY GREG GOVAN

Dr. Henry Margenau was not
announced by all the trumpets
of the sky, but he did manage
to bring a special variety of
stiow storm to the Davidson
campus.

There was, of course, the cut
and dried press release in the
loca! paper and the dailies to the
south. And Dr. Earl McCormac
sprang metaphysics on an unsus-
pecting chapel audience by way
of introduction. But Dr. Mar-
genau was his own self-contain-
ed attraction.

It is enough to say he was a

will be made for air-condition-
ing, improved lighting and
acoustics, new stage equipment,
and an elevator to serve both
the main floor and balcony of
the auditorium. No date has
been set for the beginning of
this project, but it is expected
to be completed within the next
two years.

“This renovation,” says Direc-
tor of Public Relations and De-
velopment Robert Sailstad, “is

Tournament

results are expected before. the
year is completed. With a hope-
ful eye to the future, she points.
to the. fact that there are two
freshmen (Cameron and Rice)
on the first team.

Mrs. Lilly also invited any in-
terested persons to come to Phi
Hall Monday or Wednesday
nights at 7 p.m. to see the team
in practice debate on the na-
tlonal query: ‘“‘Resolved: That
the Federal Government should
guarantee an opportunity for
higher education to al qualified
high school graduates.”

After the busy week-end of
the 16th, the team will attend
a tournament at Wake Forest
in December and has been in-
vited to attend the very large
annual meeting at Harvard later
this year. It is also likely that
Davidson will be represented in
the Naval Academy’s  tourna- |
ment.

_only a part of the total develop-
ment program, which was begun
in 1956 to meet all of Davidson’s
needs. This progress has already
been evidenced to some extent
by the renovation of the dome
room and the office ‘space in
the basement of Chambers.”

Davidson’s present
calls for an increase in re-
sources to .reach $34 million
by 1971. This would necessi-
tate an increase in endowment
and plant resources of more
than $20 million over the
present resources available.

These additional funds would
be used, not only in improving
the physical plant, but to raise
the salary level of professors
and to improve the library and
other instructional facilities as
well. The gift made by the Love
Foundation, as Sailstad points
out, is a step towards realizing
this plan.

Love, president of Burlington
Mills and a member of the Board
of Visitors, died last January at
the age of 65. President D. Grier
Martin says of him, “His inter-
est in Davidson and higher edu-
cation generally made him one
of the college’s most valued
friends. Hardly a week would
go by but that he was in touch
with us on matters concerning
the college: and his ideas and
support, evidencing a great love
for this institution, were of in:
valuable help to us.”

This particular gift was ear-
marked for the renovation of
the auditorium by the donors,
who, he adds, were well ac-
quainted with Davidson’s plans
for the future. Sailstad said, «I
hope that this step in progress
will encourage others to partici-
pate in making this institution
all that it should be.”

NUMBER TEN

Students Will Choose:
Yea Or Nay On NSA

College Membership
Hotly Debated Issue

In a special Student Council referendum Monday
after chapel, the student body will determine the survival
of the National Student Association on the local campus.

The Student Council

yesterday issued mimeo-

graphed statements of its favorable attitude toward the

association.

Student Council President.
John Spratt expressed the hope
that the students would not
“take the vote as a lark. This
would be a disservice to the
council,” he said, “and. ultimate-
ly a disservice to themselves.”

In answer to the assertion by
Pat Freeny, who has spear-
headed local opposition to the
NGA that.the organization had
“overstepped its bounds” in tak-
ing a political stand, Spratt
said, “Freeny is wrong, because
political affairs are certainly
relevant to student activities.”

Spratt also stood in opposi-
tion to the suggestion by Freeny
that a student political group
should be set up apart from the
NSA. “Individual membership,”
Spratt said “would be the only
way to operate such a group.
This organization would become
so leftist that indeed it could
not be related to student affairs
and longer.”

On the other hand, Freeny
said, “Spratt has listed what he
calls specific benefits such as
a travel program. The fact is
that these are benefits that we
haven’t had. Anyway, there are
listed in the Union about ten
good travel programs.”

Also, Freeny described
Spratt’s claim that the col-
lege hed benefitted from
speakers through the NSA.
“Certainly people know about
speakers such as James Far-
mer without the NSA.”

A main point of controversy
in the question of the NSA at
Davidson has centered around
Article X of the Constitution of
the organization. Article X
States: “A. No body acting on
behalf of the USNSA shall par-
ticipate in sectarian religious
activities or partisian political
activities; they shall not take
part in activities which do not
affect students in- their role as
Students. B. No substantial part
of activities of national and re-
gional bodies of USNSA shall be
devoted to carrying on propa-
ganda or. otherwise attempting
to influence legislation.”

“Spratt says that the resolu-
tions do not mean that we agree
with them,” Freéeny stated, “but
the constitution encourages sup-
port of these resolutions.” He
went on to say that ‘anytime
there is a group voting, the reso-
lutions will refleet generally the
attitude of the member schools
and the NSA does not list which

schools opposed the stand al-|-

though they do list the number
of dissenters.

Spratt said to Freeny last
Wednesday that in quoting
figures concerning cost of
NSA membership, “You can‘t
include regional dues because
we haven‘t paid them yet.
There's no sense paying $20
Monday if we're not going to
be in it Tuesday.”

Finally, Freeny said in his
stand against local membership,

AT REYNOLDS LECTURES

teacher, and one of a high order.
Every member of the profession
must at some time or another
make the decision to go ahead
in scholarship and research or
be primarily an instructor of
his charges. Margenau has cer-
tainly gone ahead—to the pres-
ent outer fringes of develop-
ments in physics; yet he has
also kept a foot in the teaching
area of teaching. a very adroit
foot.

He had something to share
with everyone who took the
trouble to listen. He spoke un-
der the auspices of the Reynolds
program and the YMCA. He lec-

tured to physics majors and
stirred up every would-be philo-
sopher and theologian on cam-
pus.

To everyone who did listen,
Margenau spoke in the authority
of the hearer's language; the
Richardson Scholars heard Eng-
lish as it should be employed
for instruction. There were. no
apologies for the introduction of
names or principles or technical
points, yet they were clear and
without a nimbus of semantic
jargon to hide what was being
said in the chaste obscurity of
obscurity.

Margenau had something with
him that was even more import-

ant, and it came out when Pat
Freeny ’ asked him about the
principle of uncertainty and
ethics. It seems Margenau had
just written a book about it, and
Freeny had hit upon a question
where the only apology in the
answer was in being brief. The
doctor was'plainly excited about
the subject and wanted to share
his enthusiasm.

More than his great body of
understanding, his desire to
press for the underlying unity
behind the fragmentations of
experience, his remarkable wit
and quick grasp, Margenau was
exceptional as one who knew
enough to be interested, more

‘In the last three years. the
Student Council has spent at
least $600 for conference and
$90 for dues of the NSA plus
regional dues. Yet the only
thing they can point to are elec-
tion cards.”

Junior Fred Sackett and fresh-
man Tom Frist today and tomor-
row represent Davidson at the
regional convention of the Na-
tional Student Association at
N. C. State in the face of the
possible withdrawal by David-
son from the organization.

With approximately 150
students from colleges and
universities in the Carolinas
and Virginia in attendance,
the regional convocation will!
center around topic programs
for’ improvement in student
communities. Reserving legis-
lation for the spring meeting,
the delegates will only dis-
cuss proposed bills.

If Monday's vote is in favor of
the NSA, the Student Council
has announced that it wil! pay
part expenses for any Davidson
student to attend the first an:
nual Youth Conference on Hu-
man Rights. To be held in Wash-
ington, Dec. 8-10, the confer-
ence lists as one of its purposes,
“to place the struggle for ra-
cial equality in our country in
the context of the universal
quest for human rights.”

The conference expects . to
have an address by either Presi-
dent Kennedy or Attorney Gen-
eral Robert Kennedy. Other
speakers will include these: for-
mer President of the University
of North Carolina Frank Gra-
ham, who is now connected with

the United Nations: F. K. Roy.|

consul-general of India: and
George Hauser, chairman of the
American Committee on Africa.

Miami Beach Hosts

Dec. 27, 1963 - Jan. 1, 1964, in-

The conference plans to di-

tions in the cold war. the race

lems with the theme “Is the

Ralph McGill, Pulitzer Prize-

excitement was contagious.

Not anyone at the wrestling
matches was more _ involved,
more caught up in his subject
than he. Dr. Henry Margenau
combined the showmanship of a
good sell with the utter lack of
compromise on the dignity and
seriousness of his subject. He
had the authority of knowledge
and that of spirit. Perhaps
science and the “ologies’’ are
both open-ended now in the
minds of students; if not, the

And enthusiastic belief is one
