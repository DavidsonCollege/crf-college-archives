CONCERNED COUNSELOR
Spokesman Ralph Peeples enunciates Freshman Crisis.

ounselors Petition For Coedueation

Discontent, Disillusionment
Decimating Freshman Class

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

Reacting to a rash of with-
drawals as well as widespread
discontent among the Freshman
Class, Hall Counselors this week
petitioned College President
Samuel R Spencer Jr. to adopt
a plan of implementation for
coeducation as soon as possible.

In a meeting Monday the
Hall Counselors expressed the
belief that coeducation is an
underlying cause for much of
the feeling of frustration and
disillusionment that exists in
the Freshman Class, according
to Ralph Peeples, spokesman

‘for the group.

The petition, signed by all
the counselors, said that the
discontent is manifested in four
Ways:

Senate By-Laws Rewritten
In Marathon SGA Meeting

AN ANALYSIS

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

The SGA _ Senate’s recent
action in rewriting its by-laws
occurred one week before the
Fine Film _ presentation of
Marat/Sade.

In the movie, set in an in-
sane asylum, wild inmates
screamed and writhed, chant-
ing repeatedly, “‘We want the
Revolution now!” Viewers of
the film identified with the di-
rector’s efforts, but they still
felt a sense of vertigo and a
keen sense of exhaustion.

The Senate meeting lasted al-
most six hours, spanning the
period from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.
During the progress of the
meeting, senators drifted in and
out of the Union’s Blue Room
as attendance fluctuated pre-
cariously just above a quorum.

At one point, a senator pro-
posed that the title class presi-
dent be changed. to Class Hob-
nob. Another senator alternated
from the Senate meeting to an
Advanced First Aid Class meet-
ing in the nearby Green Room,
where pupils were self-consci-
ously resurrecting a _ blonde
dummy.

In a very real sense, the un-
spoken parallel between the
Senate meeting and Marat/Sade

oss S,

was coming to mind for a num-
ber of senators. One felt a sense
of vertigo and, by the meeting's
end, virtually everyone was ex-
hausted.

One of the first moves of the
evening was a motion made by
Written amendment to strike
the words ‘so help me God”
from the oath of office that SGA
officials take routinely after
election. The argument was of-
fered that this oath imposed an
artificial piety on students, one
that might not have any ap-
plication in reality.

Senior Danny Berry countered
that the oath was already op-
tional and that the amendment
served no purpose. Berry stated,
“This change disturbs me great-
ly. 1 would say ‘‘so help me
God” after taking the oath if
I were up for re-election in
January.”

A recurrent complaint among
Senators who attended’ the
meefing was that, despite the
great length of the meeting,
there was not adequate time to
focus on some critical matters
fhat demanded Senate atten-
tion. The senators were ever
aware of the seventy amend-
ments that had been proposed
to the Senate By-laws, not with-
standing the skillful pruning al-
ready undertaken by a Senate
committee.

As the meeting wore on, there
was an un@erstandable reluc-
tance to raise objections on the
part of some dissatisfied sen-
ators.

When the final vote on the
By-laws was compiled and the
necessary two-thirds approval

was lacking, the Senate pres-
sured the dissident members
into conformity arguing that the
six-hour meeting would have
been in vain if the new by-laws
were not passed.

Another pressing need for the
Senate was to assign a new rule
on the percentage of Davidson
students who would have to vote
“no” to overturn Senate action
in referenda. Currently, two-
thirds of the total student body
must disagree with the Senate
to overturn legislative actions.
Since only about 65% of the
Students vote in referenda, ac-
cording to Senior Class Presi-
dent Bill Lear, there must be
better than unanimous dissatis-
faction with some action among
voting students.

This policy could not be
changed because it was outside
of the dominion of the by-laws.
“The Senate should have focus-
ed its attention on the SGA
Constitution rather than the by-
laws since it was the real source
of the problem in the refer-
endum issue,” Doug Brown said.
“While I don’t mind devoting
time to the Senate, I think a
reconsideration of the Constitu-
tion would have been more cen-
tral to the needs of the student
body.”

Senators Bill Ralston and
Robert Corlew headed a com-
mittee that was responsible for
the mammoth reconstruction of
the by-laws, a job that demand-
ed a good sense of organization
and an eye for detail. Their
committee did a careful job and
it is doubtful that any group

ferred to other colleges, while
several others have left with no
future plans than to stay away
from Davidson.

2. ‘The remaining freshmen
have observed those that have
left, and they now realize that
they themselves can transfer
just as easily."'

Several freshmen on each
hall already have had _inter-
views at other colleges and
some plan to depart in January
or at the end of the current
academic year.

3. ‘‘Despite recent renovations
in the dormitories, freshmen
feel such enmity and _ hostility
toward the college and its fail-
ure to respond to their needs,
that they indiscriminately de-
Stroy college property.

4. ‘‘Freshmen have repeated-
ly told us that if they could de-
cide again where to go to col-
lege, they never would have
come to Davidson.”

The counselors said that their
function has been to serve both
the college and the freshmen,
and to interpret the needs of
each to the other.

‘However, it has become in-

creasingly difficult for us to de-
fend the college’s refusal to im-
plement a plan for coeduca-
tion,”’ the hall counselors said.
“In counseling the freshmen,
we have found that in almost
every case involving transfer.
¢oeducation is always an under-
lving factor in their decision.”

They felt that most freshmen
were accustomed to fraterniz-
ing with females in high school:
consequently the Davidson en-
vironment makes adjustment to
cullege even more difficult than
it ordinarily might be for a

freshman.

“The situation has become so
acute that we can no longer
put off the crisis that exists
any longer,’ Peeples said.
‘Many workable plans for co-
education have been submitted
that would not be a financial
burden on the college. All that
needs to be done is for the
President to take the simple ac-
tion of selecting and implement-
ing one plan.”

Peeples said that an imme-
diate decision en coeducation
would go a long way toward
relieving the bitterness and
frustration which is presently
expressed by the Freshman
Class but which is found among
the upperclasses as well.

Steve Suflas, hall counselor
in Cannon Dorm, has lost three
freshmen in the last week, and
expects more to leave as the
year proceeds.

“The major complaint of the
guys that have left was that
there is a total lack of oppor-
tunity to establish meaningful
relations with females,” Suflas
said. ‘‘Understandably fresh-
man morale is dangerously low
on my hall.”

Suflas said that it has become
a common occurance on Satur-
day nights for his freshmen to
get together and discuss why
they don't like Davidson.

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry said he believed the peti-
tion accurately expressed the
attitude of much of the fresh-
man class.

“I think it is significant that
this group of men who have the
most intimate contact with
freshmen should be alarmed to
