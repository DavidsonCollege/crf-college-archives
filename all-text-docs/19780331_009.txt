Squads start anew

After a shivering winter lay-
off, the beautiful spring weather
brings with it a revitalization of
Davidson’s Club Sports. (There
should have been some winter
activity, but the Ice Hockey
Club was put in cold storage
and had their funds frozen due
to lack of organization and
participation.) Anyway, we now
have five Clubs in some shape
or form breaking a sweat some-
where besides in the classroom.

Rosenberg’s Rowdies, the
Football Club, opens play this
Sunday with an away game at
Wake Forest. Months of prepa-
ration and hours of grueling
practice have been sacrificed in
an attempt to better a highly
successful fall season.

The Soccer Club has survived
forfeits, postponements, rain,
and snow to trip

Frank attains
milestone win

Tennis coach Jeff Frank (in
his 6th season with the cats)
recently reached a major pla-
teau by chalking up his 100th
win as a coach. The team’s
victory over MIT Tuesday
brought coach Frank’s record
to 100-40-1, a winning percen-
tage of .709 that makes him
the winningest active coach of
a varsity sport at Davidson. A
1966 graduate of Davidson,
Frank has been associated
with three championship
teams (as a player in ’65 and
66 and, in his first year as
coach, 1973). Judging from
scores so far this year’s team
promises to be one of his best.
The squad has already compil-
ed a record of 12-2, and hopes
to continue their winning
ways.

so far. Beginning play in the
latter stages of February, the
gallant booters have surmoun-
ted obstacle upon obstacle, the
latest one being away games
with teams in Asheville and the
unfortunate loss of.a home field.
Playoff chances appear slim,
but the Cats are still kicking
and heading in the right direc-
tion.

The Lacrosse Club had to
suffer through several key inju-
ries and an onslaught of E.H.
Little Disease in a disappoint-
ing season so far. Goalie
Thompson and Peg-leg Ferraro
have kept the troops hanging
tough. Those rambunctious
Ruggers are: alive and well and
doing what they always do best,
and playing some good rugby,
too. A further update of them as
soon as last week’s party ends.

Waterskiing has-some big
plans\in the making for the
warm spring weather as soon as
Lake Norman fills up with
water. You'll be hearing a lot
more about them and their new
Polish recruit, A. Ikanski. Hey,
later. Do it with a Club.

Lady Cattes seek state title

By LISA JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Spring brings to Davidson
sunny weather, good attitudes
and tennis courts occupied by
the Varsity Women’s team.
Coach Pat Miller and her team
began their 1978 season with a
spring break venture to Tampa,
Florida.

This pre-season workout in-’

cluded many. challenge matches
and intensive practices, but
proved to be effective because it
enhanced the competitive na-
ture of the players and united
the team.

Returning players for this
year’s team are Kirk Cameron,
Nancy Brown, Mary Gilliam,
Bunny Horine, Tanda Wither-
spoon, Andrea Murphy, and
Susan Casper.

The new freshmen on the
to the team. Hope McArn,
,Anne Stanback, Tricia Haynes

and Grace Morgan are the re-:

cent editions to this year’s line-
up.

Challenge matches are being
played regularly and Miller has
emphasized the flexibility of the
ladder, indicating that it can
change at any time. ‘‘For the
first time ever, the team wants
what is best. for the team,
instead of themselves,’”’ added
Miller, with reference to chal-
lenge matches.

The outlook for the season
appears to be tough because
Davidson has recently changed
to the Division II Small College
League, but must continue to
compete against large colleges.

Fifteen matches are sche-
duled and the women have

_ already defeated Converse,

Pfeiffer, and N.C. State, but
came up short in their match
against Peace College.

With high hopes of another
good season, Miller added that
their goal this year, along with
improvement, is to win the
small college state tournament.

For the first time, a JV
‘women’s team has been orga-
nized and is being coached by
