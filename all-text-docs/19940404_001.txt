Drop/Add changes
to simplify process

By Martha Knight

Registrar Polly Griffin, fac-
ulty department chairs, and the
SGA Council on Academic Af-
fairs have worked to create a new
registration system that they hope
will alleviate long drop/add lines
on the first day of fall classes.

When students receive their
registration materials on April 13,
they will notice that the form for
choosing classes has been changed.
An instruction sheet included in
the packet will explain how to fill
out the new “tree.”

Every course has, been as-
signeda five-digit number. In com-
pleting the forms, students must
usc #2 pencils to fill in the numbers
for their chosen courses. A new
Banner software program will then
scan the sheets to assign classes.

As part of the registration pro-

cess, students will receive a new
identification card at no charge.
Students should have the: cards
made before they turn in their forms
at the Registrar’s Office between
April 13 and 27.

The Registrar’s Office will
mail schedules to the homes of all
returning students on July 18.
Students may adjust their sched-
ules over the telephone between
August 1 and 12. They can drop
any course but can only add 300
and 400 level courses. Griffin says
that “it would be unfair” to allow
returning students to fill places in
100 and 200 level courses before
incoming freshmen have a chance
to go through the drop/add process
during orientation.

The Registrar’s Office will not

Take Back
the Night

promotes
awareness

By Russ Tarver

Asa crowd of 200 filtered into
the 900 Room for the annual “Take
Back the Night” event, every fourth
person received a “black dot” sig-
nifying the percentage of the U.S.
population victimized by sexual
assault.

“One in four college women
and one in seven college men will
be victims of sexual assault,” said
junior Jo Burrows who opened the
program with a list of shocking
statistics.

After junior B.J. Rudell read
an original poem about a female
rape victim, three Davidson stu-
dents recounted their tales of ac-
quaintance-rape and their methods
of survival.

Junior Jo Burrows opened the Take Back the Night event with
shocking statistics about sexual assault.

as one woman described how anxi-
ety over an experience of sexual
assault put her in the hospital with
internal bleeding.

By talking openly about their -

experiences, the speakers urged
other victims not to keep their sto-
ries locked inside. One woman
explained how telling someone her
story helped her feel better about
herself and deal with the emotional

trauma of acquaintance-rape.

“Sexual assault changes who
you are and your perception on
life,” said junior Sarah Orsbon,
organizer of the event. “It’s like
part of you dies or part of your best
friend dies because there is no way
you can get that same person back
again.”

before coeducation, the Greek
Week was termed “Hell Week” as
the all-male fraternity oriented
court engaged in all types of wild
activities. With the advent of co-
education, Greek Week changed
