Faculty Members Plan to Eliminate Fun on All Levels in Its Latest Stupidity, The No Fun Policy

By Shirley McLean

The new alcohol policy has
triggered several other measures
regulating students’ out of class
activities. After noticing that the
_GPA of students went up after the
implementation of the opressive
alcohol policy, the administration
is attempting to raise the GPA of
students even higher. “Well, we
just got to talkin’ about how much
stuff there was for students to do
other than study, and we decided

that it should be stopped,” said an .

anonymous member of the fac-
ulty. The wheels have been set in

motion to remove all forms of en-
tertainment from dorm rooms. No
televisions, Nintendos, or stereos
will be allowed on campus. The
same source said, “They’re just
way too disruptive. Students can’t
study while watching television or
listening to music. We’ve got to
get rid of these distractions.”
Asitturns out, the faculty will
not be satisfied until everyone has
a4.0 GPA. “There’s just no ex-
cuse for anything else. We won’t
quitreducing outside activities until
everyone graduates at the top of
the class.” He went on to say that

"We are doing every-
thing we can to worm
our way out of this one.”

will not engage in playful gun-
fights which intentionally or reck-
lessly result in physical injury to
any person on College premises.
This includes BB guns.”

Terry emphasized that the stu-
dents responsible for the incident
will not be punished en mass, but
“will be dealt with on an individual
basis.”

Urbino is not being charged
with any violation.

When asked about the nature

of the Douwsile "Scere Provation,
Dean Terry remarked, “That’s for
me to know and you to find out.”

Whenasked whether it wasn’t
just an old joke he saw in a movie
once that he was using to appease
the trustees and: the local media,
Terry replied, “No comment.”

The College has received a
good deal of negative coverage in
the local media over the incident.
Reports on Charlotte’s Channel 9
and inthe Charlotte Observer have
given the “murder” incident high
profile.

Chapter 5, Article 3 of the
North Carolina State Law defines
“murder” as “to injure someone so
badly that they stop living.”

‘At press time, the local and
federal authorities were allowing
the College to deal with the inci-
dent internally. FBI Agent Smith

explained, “We'd like to defer to
the College in this instance, first of
all, because the whole thing is so
bizarre, and second, because it
saves us a lot of paperwork.”

Holmes said that one thing in
SPE’s favor has been the very help-
ful response of the National Orga-
nization to the incident. The more
the National helps to resolve the
incident with the chapter internally,
the easier itis for Davidson to pass
the buck.

“We are doing everything we
can think of to worm our way out

ef this onc}
Newnam said.

A SPE brother who wished to
remain anonymous (a differentone
from the one mentioned above)
said, “Man, we’re bummed. I
mean, the thing was just supposed
to be a game.”

“We didn’t really mean -any-
thing by it. It was just a joke. We
just picked up the wrong guns.”

Urbino was unavailablg. for
comment.

in the spring semester, no sporting
equipment of any kind will be al-
lowed. “I’m sick and tired of see-
ing those gosh darned frisbees be-
ing thrown all over campus on
sunny days. Why can’t they be
reading Sartre or Camus? That’s
what I do for fun.”

The Residence Life Office will
begin conducting random room
searches next semester. Debate
has sprung up over whether to in-
clude the honor code in the No Fun
Study All the Time policy. In fact,
the SGA is debating just how far
the honorcode will extend with the

No Fun policy. Can someone be
expelled for playing air drums in
California? It’s questions like these
that are haunting the advocates of
the policy.

Another debate has sprung up
over whether sex should be in-
cluded in the NoFun policy. After
all, itis quite difficult to study and
have sex at the same time. “I think
that students have no business hav-
ing sex. They’re wasting valuable
study time. If they want to think
about sex, then read DH Lawrence
or Joyce Carol Oates. You don’t

need the real thing. Hell, Ihaven’t

had sex in thirty years,” ouranony-
mous source contributed.

If the act passes, then it will be
an honor code violation to have
sex while enrolled at Davidson,
While this may not affect the lives
of very many students, the ones
who do occasionally get laid are
putting up some resistance, as are
the chronic masturbators.
“Masterbation is not quite as bad
as sex,” our source interjected. “At
least you have one hand free to turn
the pages. And I don't want to be a
hypocrite, and I just couldn't have
gone solong without... you know."

Student Found

Dead After
Recreation of
Crucifixion

By Wonder Boy |

Whatever the organizers of last
week's recreation of the Crucifix-
ion wanted, they never expected to
get such a close redo. But, when
Ami Clueless was found dead, the
group was really hyped.

"We never expected every-
thing to go so-well. now we really
no what the people in the crowd at
the crucifixion felt like. I've never
been so closed to God." That's
what Yesur Clueless, Ami's brother
and wife, said after they found her.

The: group plans to recreate
what happened in Waco, Texas
last week, using the new kiosk in
frontofthe seniorapartments. "We
just hope we can find enough
people willing to burn," said
Clueless.
