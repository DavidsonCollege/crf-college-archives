Now no excuses for not
knowing PCC alcohol policy

The Patterson Court Coun-
cil hasestablished this policy in
the interest of promoting the
responsible service and con-
sumption of alcoholic bever-
ages on Patterson Court. This

- policy mustbe approved annu-

ally by three-fourths (3/4) of
the houses currently active on
Patterson Court. Approval by
each house requires anaffirma-
tive vote by two-thirds (2/3) of

All houses on Patterson Court

1. This policy will apply to
any party, social function or

be served only in a designated
service area which shall be en-
tered only by persons 21 years

found in section I.3. Presidents
and social chairmen who are

forms of alcohol) then a service
monitor must be present. The
monitor’s duty is to oversee

tion. Individuals removing al-
coholic beverages from the
monitored area will do so with
the understanding that they
are responsible if the beverage
is given to an under-age indi-
vidual for consumption.

able with a fine and/or up to
two years in prison).

passport or U.S. military I.D. If
the individual is not a
Davidson student, valid identi-
fication in the form of a state
driver’s license or a passport
must be shown. This policy
applies to and includes invited
guests and entertainers. The
entrance monitor will stamp
the individual’s hand with a
distinctive rubber stamp. The
entrance monitor must not
consume alcoholic beverages
while on duty and must not be
obviously intoxicated.

erages will be served by the

ice areaincontainers which are
larger than 22 ounces. No car-
rying containers will be used to
remove alcoholic beverages
from the designated drinking
area.

beverages will be availableand
visibly displayed as long as
alcoholic beverages are avail-
able at any event.

9. Any alcohol made avail-
able for general consumption

(such as but not limited to
donated kegs) must fall under
the Patterson Court Alcohol
Policy.

10. Individuals removing
the alcoholic beverages from
the designated servicearea will
do so with the understanding
that they are responsible if the
beverage is given to an under-
age individual for consump-
tion. (North Carolina law states
that giving an alcoholic bever-
age toan under-age individual
is a general misdemeanor pun-
ishable witha fineand/or up to
two years in jail).

or plan drinking games or con-
tests as social functions.

vide safe transportation to any

ter of every year, each Patter-
son Court house will schedule
at least one mandatory house
meeting for the purpose of
educating its members about
responsible drinking. This

narily no later that the end of

South Africa’s de Klerk takes small reform steps

By CAROL GATEWOOD
SOVIET UNION: On Monday Foreign
Minister Eduard A Shevardnadze ad-
dressed the Sovict legislature and criti-
cized monumental. foreign policy deci-
sions that were made by the Kremlin in
the past decade. In his speech, the for-
eign minister openly stated that the
Soviet Union “violated the norms of
proper behavior...[ with]... the dispatch
of troops to Afganistan. We committed
the most serious violations of our own
legislation, our party and_ civilian
norms.” Shevardnadze also admitted
that a radar station at Krasnoyarsk had
violated the ABM treaty with the
United States. The Soviets will remove
this station that the US. cited asa viola-

tion of the treaty several years ago. The™

New York Times described this speech
as a “highly unusual act of contrition,”

and it signaled just one more attack by
Gorbachev upon the military excesses
and stagnant rule of Leonoid Brezhnev.
Along with this attempt to break with
the past, Shevardnadze also said that
Eastern Europe’s political problemsare
“historic, qualitative changes” that the
-Soviet Union should “respect.” ©

BUDAPEST: On Monday Hungary

proclaimed itself a republic 32 years
after its uprising against the Soviet
Union that led toa “Socialist People’s”
government. The formation of the new
republic came only four months after
the 1956 incident was accepted as a

“popular uprising” instead of a.
. counterrevolution when Imre Nagy’s
remains ‘were reentered with ‘honor. ”

Nagy led the uprising. Acting Presi-
dent Szeros in a celebratory speech

stated that the new government will be
“an independent, democratic and legal
state in which the values of bourgeois
democracy and democratic socialism
are express equally.”

SOUTH AFRICA: F.W. de Klerk, South

Africa’s new president, continues to
take small steps toward changes in the
apartheid government. A week and a
half ago de Klerk released Walter
Sisulu, a member of the illegal African
National Congress imprisoned for 26
years. Sisulu’s freedom is uncondi-

tional. de Klerk has recently also al-:

lowed open demonstrations against the
South African government as an at-
tempt towards substantial reforms, but
the president can expect to run into
some barriers soon to his political goals.
De Klerk’s actions have gone against

laws made by the Congress of theSouth
African government that cater to an
apartheid system. Police forces are act-
ing against their mandate and the court
system cannot handle cases properly.
The president also indicated that the
state of emergency in South Africa
which has been in effect sine 1986 might
be lifted. ‘

LEBANON: General Michel Aoun, the
leader of the Lebanese Christian Militia
rejected a peace accord adopted by 62
Lebanese leaders in Saudi Arabia. The
new plan would restructure the govern-
mentof Lebanon so that the cabinet and
parliament would equally represent

Christians and Muslims. This attempt

to end a 14 year old civil war was also
rejected by two main Shiite militias that
are backed by Syria. ae
