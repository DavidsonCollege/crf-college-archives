Swetenburg, Thinclads Rout Guilford

By DAVID MELTON
Staff Writer

The Davidson track team, led
by iron-man Ray Swetenburg,
recorded a sound victory Fri-
day, over Guilford.

Swetenburg, a senior pre-med
major from Gainesville, Geor-
gia eclipsed Davidson’s total
point per meet record by scoring
27%, points. The old record of
25 points was set in 1930 by
Heath Whittle, Davidson track
coach.

Swetenburg’s story is one of
surprising successs. ‘I didn't
start running track until my
senior year in high school,” he
explained. -

A spectator of the meet Fri-
day would never have known
this, however. Swetenburg
promptly took first place rib-
bons in the broad jump, the
triple jump, the high hurdles,
and the 220 yard dash.

He also finished second in the

high jump and the 100-yard dash
and ran a leg on the winning
440 yard relay team.

Swetenburg attributes much

- of his success to Wildcat track

coach Heath Whittle. ‘‘He'’s
helped me in the hurdles more
than anything else,” he explain-
ed.

The reason Swetenburg partic-
ipates in track is simple. ‘I run
track because it’s fun; records
are just fringe benefits,” he
said.

As for his accomplishments,
Swetenburg acknowledged that
he is pleased, ‘‘but there's al-
ways room for improvement.”

He also feels that participat-
ing in a non-subsidized program
has not been a disadvantage to
him. Swetenburg added, ‘‘one
reason I’ve enjoyed track is be-
cause it isn’t subsidized and
therefore not as pressurized.”

One disadvantage he has had
is his major. He explained that

“being pre-med, it’s been hard
to work tiack in with my labs
and everything.”

However, he also added that
“track at Davidson is as much
hard work as you want it to
be.”

When Swetenburg came to Da-
vidson as a freshman, he did
not know what to expect, as far
as track was concerned.

He commented, ‘‘I didn’t win
any hurdles events my fresh-
man vear, but it didn’t discour-
age me because I was having
fun.”

Upon being asked if he felt
that he could compete national-
lv, Swetenburg replied, "I’m not
on a national level.’”” However,
he once qualified to compete na-
tionally, indoors, but he did not
get to go.

Swetenburg holds the David-
son triple jump record of 47'8”
in addition to his hurdle mark.
He has cleared 6’2” in the high
jump and has long jumped 21’-
4%", with best clockings of 10.1
and 23.0 in the 100- and 220-
yard dashes, respectively.

‘Tron-Man” Swetenburg, how-
ever, did have a large support-
ing cast Friday with nine other
Wildcats recording first place
finishes.

Tommy Richardson took the
100 yard dash in 9.9 seconds.
Mark Conners won the 440 yard
dash in 51.7 secends, and Ricky
Bell took the mile in 4:25.4.

This was the fastest mile run
by a Davidson student in ten
years.

Bell commented on his _ per-
formance by saying “it took a
lot of: hard work and practice,
bu:, to me it’s fun.” He also
gave credit to the coaches by
adding ‘‘Coaches Whittle and
Martin both had me ready.”

In other races, freshman Bob
Lautensack won the 880, How-
ard Boyd took the 3-mile run,
and Steve Still won the 440 yard
hurdles.

In the pole vault, Woody Van
Meter, another freshman, set a
school record of 13 feet.

The old record was 12 feet 7%
inches set by Bill Mills in 1962.
Van Meter expects more im-
provement this year and he set
14 feet as his goal.

David Crumpler, a junior from
Magnolia, Arkansas, won the
discus, and the shot put was
taken by Steve Shankweiler, a

junior from Atlanta, Georgia.

Coach Whittle, who is retiring
after this year, commented ‘I
was well pleased with the per-
formance.” He was happy with
everyone’s performance, but
added that he was “especially
pleased with Van Meter and
Swetenburg.”

Whittle also pointed out that
Swetenburg broke his own school

‘ONE OF THE FAMILY’

record im the high hurdles by
turning in a 14.3 second per-
formance. The former record
was 14.4 seconds.

The next meet for the Wild-
cats is April 8 at Berry College
in Rome, Georgia. Whittle ex-
pects everyone to be healthy
and well by this next meet. He
added that several members of
the team have been sick.

Willie Deese Dies
In Auto Accident

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

An automobile accident last
Saturday evening claimed the
life of Willie Deese, an em-
ployee of Davidson College since
1953. .

Deese, aged 69, was, killed
when his car skidded off icy
highway 73 between Davidson
and Concord.

Funeral services for Deese
will be held tomorrow in Ter-
rence Chapel at 2 p.m.

Deese served the college as a
maintenance worker for the
athlecic department. His super-
visor, Junior Barker, remem-
bered Deese as a very reliable
and dependable worker.

‘Willie was just like one of the
family, and I’m really going to
miss him. I could trust him to
always do a great job getting
the tennis courts ready, to regu-
late the chemicals in the pool or
to issue and check in equip-
ment,” Barker recalled.

Barker also revealed that
Deese was a great fan of for-
mer Davidson head basketball
coach Lefty Driesell.

‘Lefty was always ‘his’ coach,
since Willie was here when
Lefty came. He remembered the
beginnings that Lefty had with
that old station wagon and little
money to recruit with.”

“Saturday afternoon Willie
brought a small television to
work and watched Maryland
play in the NIT while he man-
aged the equipment room. I’m
glad Willie got to see Lefty win
that champicnship.”

Deese was also extremely in-

terested in the tennis team, and
had been responsible’ for main-
tenance of the courts. since
1964.

Davidson tennis coach Harry
Fogleman stated that Deese was
going to be missed, and empha-
sized his reliability.

“I never had to worry about
Willie doing his job on the
courts. He learned how to con-
Struct the base of the courts,
and the amount of water re-
quired by each court. He would
always say ‘these are my courts
and this is my team’,” Fogle-
man explained.

The Robert Lee Stowe Tennis
House was a source of pride for
Deese, according to Fogleman.

“One day Willie met Mr.
Stowe and promised to take
good care of the building. He
always kept it clean.”

‘“‘Willlie was always doing lit-
tle personal things for the play-
ers, like looking after their
equipment. He would also know
how to repair nets, which pre-
vented us from having to make
costly replacements,” Fogleman
said.

“I don’t believe that Willie
ever go: mad, except when stu-
dents would play with basket-
ball shoes on _ composition
courts,” Fogleman added.

With the passing of Willie
Deese, the Davidson athletic
family lost a valuable worker
and friend. As Barker remark
ed, ‘Willie was from the old
school in a lot of ways. He
stuck to the rules, and you don’t
find many people like that #
around any more.”
