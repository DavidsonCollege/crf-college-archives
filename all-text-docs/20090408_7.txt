Motivation

Lake Campus—Dozens of
students converged throughout the
weekend to enjoy the warm weath-
er and sunny days of spring in
North Carolina. The fun, however,
was short-lived. An abrupt rever-
sion to winter weather Monday
night upset many students. Megan
Anderson ’09 summed up what the
majority of campus was feeling:
“What the hell is this bullshit?”

After a weekend that saw
temperatures rise into the low 80s,
professors were concerned with
the amount of time students were
spending outside, actually enjoy-
ing themselves. Citing his presi-
dential authority, Tom Ross de-
cided to take matters into his own
hands and “restore the sanctity and
preeminence of the classroom at
Davidson College.” Ross’ strategy
involved a high-tech weather ma-
nipulation system purchased on the
black market from a corrupt North
Korean general. The device, which
cost an estimated $13 million, can
be used to manipulate weather pat-
terns within a 30 mile radius.

Ross started the contraption
around 2:00 p.m. Monday, after
spending all morning collecting
its unusual fuel of puppies, kittens
and orphans’ tears. The device be-
gan by sucking all the warmth and
happiness from its environment.
Some time around 4:15 p.m., the
machine also began generating
winds described by one sophomore
as “colder than a witch’s teat.”
Hoses connected to Lake Norman
chilled the water to an unbearable
degree, rendering swimming im-
possible to anything without a coat
of blubber several inches thick.

Ross considers his first at-
tempt at weather manipulation a
success. “Well, if you look.around
campus, the library is full again,
and I know of at least two Spanish
majors who haven’t left the Belk
Lab in over a day.” By making the
natural world as miserable as pos-
sible, Ross encourages students to
remain indoors and catch up on a
semester’s worth of Humanities
reading. It has been rumored that -
Ross was responsible for melt-
ing the light sprinkling of snow
earlier this year with a hair dryer.
As Ross sprinkled broken glass on
the chairs outside the Union, he
explained: “If you are a student at
my college, your nose should be in
a book, not a flower.”

This has not been the first

Next Year’s Semi-formal Event

The Rock Quarry — Due to
recent occurrances during David-
son College’s 2009 spring formal
season, one eating house has de-
cided to turn off the beaten path
and host their next formal at the
Charlotte Presbyterian Hospital
(CPH) i in Charlotte.

CPH offers a wide variety of
dining and beverage choices

Speaking on the condition
of anonymity one member said,
“We had an emergency Britney
Spears themed sisterhood and de-
cided that for formals, at the end
of the night when all is said and
done, this [the hospital] is where
we wanna be.”

Eating houses and lesser
fraternities are famous for host-
ing formals at the place called

the Rock Quarry, a venue where
the Carolina Blonde flows like
Powerade at Commons and cheap
bands play mediocre music until
everybody’s clothes are stained
with red wine.

Let’s face it: the Quarry is get-
ting old, people are literally get-
ting sick of it. The CPH is the new
place to be.

‘,..Carolina Blonde
flows like Powerade
at Commons...”

CPH has a lot of features that
this particular eating house is
looking for. It has a bomb cafete-
ria for the pre-party meal, a sick
conference room that can easily be
tured into an iPod-and-speakers
dance party and the security is so
concentrated on mental patients
escaping, its easy to sneak flasks
in.

Additionally, there are on call
doctors and nurses prepared to
assist anyone who gets sick of the
formal and for lack of a better ex-
ample, needs to get their stomach
pumped.
