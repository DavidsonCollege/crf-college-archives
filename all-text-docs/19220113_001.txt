Dwight Chalmers Speaks
at Opening Y Service

Mr. Jackson Urges Students to Take
Interest in Mission Study.”

With an address by Secretary Chal-
mers, preceded by a stirring appeal from
Mr. Jackson for a real interest in the
mission study campaign being launched

by the Y. M. C. A,, the “Y” started off ‘

another year of highly successful vesper
services last Sunday.

Mr. Jackson told of the plans for Bible
study for the next few months and brief-
ly gave four reasons why college men
should have a knowledge of missions.
His four reasons why Davidson men
should know about missions were: First
because pastors need the help and in-
spiration of their congregations; second,
so much is expected of Davidson men
along religious lines; third, man, for his
development, needs a superhuman task,
such as mission work and it teaches him
the value of prayer; fourth, Christ’s
command, “Go ye into all the world—”
As this command applies with equal
force to all Christians a knowledge of
missions is needed in order to intelligent-
ly further the mission cause. is

Dwight Chalmers then gave an in-
spiring talk in which he concisely out-
lined James’ three tests for pure religion.

Men have tried to define a religious
person as one who is scrupulous in ob-
serving religious ceremonies, who reads
the Bible, prays, and goes to church.
But this is not the definition given by
James. His three tests are controlling
the tongue, aiding others, and keeping
yourself unspotted from the world.

Along with the control of the tongue
comes our passions and habits. Over-
indulgence in a thing will destroy that
sensitive touch to a person’s religious
life and prevent him from really know-
ing God.

James’ second requirement is found in
James 1:27, “to visit the fatherless and
widows in their affliction.” This oppor-
tunity is not well afforded at Davidson.
but there are students on every hand
who need sympathy and help in various
ways.

Two rules for keeping unspotted from
the world are hating wrong and immoral
things, and loving purity and honesty.

The solo “Alone,” by Ted Jones, which
was well sung, was appreciated by all.

Mr. Jackson closed the service with a
prayer.

The original plans called for a one-
story structure. If these plans had been
carried out the building would have ex-
tended to within a few feet of the laun-
dry and the rear of it would have been
akhout 15 feet above the ground. It was
therefore considered best to alter the
plans somewhat and construct a two-
story building.

The department of Physics will occupy
the first floor. It will consist of two
large laboratories, one for the sopho-
mores and the other for the juniors, a
lecture room, an office, and a stockroom.
The size of these laboratories will pro-
vide each student with an abundance of
room in which to work out his experi-
ments, thereby enabling him to secure
better results than formerly.

On the second floor there are to be
four lecture rooms, three offices, and a
stockroom.

There will be two laboratories in the
basement, one of which is to be used
by the applied math class.

The building will be very commodious
and is to be supplied with steam heat
and an abundance of light. Extra piers
will be provided for the heavy apparatus
in each of the laboratories. These lab-
oratories are to be well wired and will
be supplied with both direct and alter-
nating current.

The apparatus with which the Physics
laboratories are to be equipped will be
all new and of the most modern and im-
proved type. The concern from which
the apparatus is to be ordered place fire
loss orders above all others and attempt
to have all such orders sent out by ex-
press 48 hours after their receipt.

Walls of Chambers Razed
Ready For New Structure

as Funds Are in Hand.

A few days before college closed for
the Christmas holidays Davidson
abruptly awakened by the sound 6f sev-
eral terrible explosions which shook the
entire campus. On rushing to their win-
dows the students saw the massive walls
of old Chambers crumbling to the ground
and clouds of red dust pouring upward
from the remnants of the building.

This. seeming miracle was explained
by the fact that dynamite was being used
on the dormitory to make room for the
new building which is to replace it.
Sometime in the course of the
month only four stately columns and a
pile of debris will mark the former site
of one of the most historic edifices in
the Southland.

As soon as the ground is cleared and
the pledges from the late campaign are
made good a new building will be com-
menced. While it is known that no dor-
mitory could’ ever replace Chambers, it
is hoped that, this structure will at least
resemble Chambers in its appearance
and will far surpass it'in equipment. The
same ground plan is to be maintained
throughout and the central portion of
the building will be given over to offices
and classrooms, while the second floor
will form a large auditorium. The two
wings will be equal to one large dor-
