students to take seats outside. the sanctuary, if Iingle Chapel and in the narthex.

.(than two hours in closed ses-
sion yesterday afternoon.

K SMITH - This committee is com-

C. Shaw Smith, Dr. P. N. Tra-
kas, Mr. Arthur Griffin; and
Dr. James Causey. They have
made an effort in most in-
stances to choose fresh, young
talent. well-known in music cir-|
cles but not yet foremost in
the public’s cye, as the quality
of their performance is usually
higher than that found among
the established artists. |

New York will perform in a
varied evening of quartet litera-
ture from four experienced
teacher-performers. The last
evening of the series on April
2 will feature the dance satirists
Mata and Hari. Their recital
will consist of “The World in
Pantomime.”

The series has been consid-
ered a very successful under-
taking in past seasons aad an
even greater reception is anti-

'cipated this year.

The first performance will be
on Friday, October 24, Home-
coming Weekend. At that time
Richard Dyer-Bennet, nationally
known minstrel and guitarist,
will present a program centered
around the world’s great tra-
ditional songs. Mr. Dyer-Pennet
was born in England, but has
spent most of his life in Ameri-
ca, where he is known as a
composer and lyric tenor.

On November 7, Nell Rankin,

Construction of Davidson’s new Dana Laboratories
is expected to begin on October 2 with groundbreaking
ceremonies and the launching of a new college fund
drive, “The Dana Challenge Program.”

The groundbreaking ceremony, planned for the
chapel hour on next Thursday, will bring to the campus
a number of Trustees and program committee chairmen
as well as the donor of initial funds for the building,
Mr. Charles A. Dana, of Wilton, Connecticut.

A platform and seating space will be placed at the
building site for the program. Music will be provided
by the Male Chorus and the College Band. Activities
will be highlighted by the breaking of ground and an
informal talk by Mr. Dana. ‘

Dana, an automotive parts manufacturer and pres-
ident of the Dana Foundation, visited the Davidson Cam-
pus last spring and later donated $400,000 to the col-

lege, to be used for construction of a new science build-
ing and dormitory. A stipulation of the grant was that

“] would say that the one great need of American college students is to find
an ideology and philosophy that can be accepted intellectually and then complete
dedication to that ideology.” So spoke Dr. Billy Grham in an exclusive interview

Council next Monday evening.” These were the words

of Student Body President John Kuykendall in a DAVID- ,

SONIAN interview last Wednesday.

“The committee,” Kuykendall
went on, “ is composed of Dave
Robinson. Bob Livingston. and
myself. The Council hopes to
have a finished plan ready for
presentation to the student
body by the first of November.”

Queried as to the one month
delay, Kuykendall replied, “We
feel that such a step is a very
important one, and we want to
be sure that the plan is what we
want. I think that our present
set-up is inferior to an Honor
Council, but there is not too
much urgency on action. Our
present plan is to have the
Honor Council go into effect at
Spring Elections; to avoid the
complications we would face if
it were started in mid-year.-

Davidson. I am definitely not
going to get a chance to visit
schools outside Mecklenburg
County, but I do hope to get out
to Davidson.

Q. What. do you see as the
one great need of American
students?

A. I would say the greatest
single need is to have an idcolo-
gy and philosophy that can
be accepted intellectually, and
then complete dedication to
that ideology. I don't see. why
that philosophy can’t be true
Christianity — it should be.
Jean Paul Sartre has said. ‘“‘Man
is so psychologically made that
he needs something to which he
can cling.” [ think that history
bears out the fact that Chris-
tianity is the most successful

by the old council?

_ Answer: We still plan to go
through a short period of guid-
ance. Furthermore, we hope to
make the arrangement flexible
enough so that after two or
three years, the Council can be
re-evaluated and modified in
certain respects if necessary.
Question: What is the Stu-
dent Council's stand on the
freshman riots this year?
Answer: We are interested in
the show of class spirit, but
definitely opposed to any de-
facement of school property. If
the riots continue, and if they
are as violent as they have)
been, the Student Council and
the Court of Control will be
on hand to take judicial action
if needed.

A. Only this, some church
colleges have _ become so
secularized that they have got-
ten away from their original
mores. A student going to such
a school expecting to receive a
good” religious _ background,
could be very hurt if he did not
find it there.

Q. Do you favor required
church services such as we at
Davidson have?

A. Well. there are two sides
to that question. I preach every
Christmas at West Point, and
that service is required, yet
there is a great spirit and dis-
cipline present, and I am sure
that some men arc reached: at
this service that would not be

otherwise. On the other side,

Question What about the
faculty regulation concerning
firearms in the dormitory? Is
the Council planning to perhaps
strengthen this regulation by
action of its own?

Answer: No. I don't think
that it is necessary that the
Council. take a stand on this
matter, [t is a matter of spread-
ing the Council’s authority too

but one we hope will resolve it-
self.

Question: There. has
talk on campus about the new
fraternity court. being condu-
cive to drinking on campus. Is
the Council planning any close
supervision this year?

Answer: No,. we aren't. The
supervision will come from us
and from the faculty at. the
off-campus parties .during the
dance weekends. I’m afraid
that we are in danger of losing!
that traditional privilege and,
I hope that the fraternities will,
use their heads“at. their off-cam-
pus parties.

Question: Do you plan tol
make any modifications. in the
elections system next spring? |

Answer: [ hope we = can
liberalize the system somewhat.
This is certainly not to say that
we will adopt a “no-holds bar-

The purpose of their meet-
ing was to decide upon a perma-
nent solution to the prdblem of
overflow attendance at Vespers,
and the Executive Committee
was given authority by Presi-
dent Martin to act on their ad-
vice immediately, without a
vote by the full faculty.

TEMPORARY

The Religious Life Commit-
tee, however, was unable to ar-

thin. It is certainly a problem,:rive at a unanimous decision

on any long-range policy, and
the proposal finally submitted
to the Executive Committee was
intended only as a temporary
measure.

Several alternatives were.
brought before the commit-
tee for consideration. These
included: abolition of Ves-
per attendance = require-
ments for seniors; free cuts.
for seniors on the Sundays
with the heaviest atten-
dance, including all dance
weekend and the first three
or four Sundays of each
semester; double services
at these times, divided be-
tween the two upper and
the two lower classes; Ves-
per attendance credit for

elsewhere; and moving the
services back into Cham-

friends of the college match his gift with equal funds—
a “challenge grant.”

The challenge prompted a campaign entitled “The
Dana Challenge Program” which is now gaining mo-
mentum under the direction of Presidential Assistant
Sailstad and a group of alumni chairmen.

The Dana Laboratories, according to Sailstad, will
be ready for occupancy sometime during the 1958-1959
school year. It will house the Biology and Physics De-
partments. The present Martin Building will be used
for the chemistry department.

The new building will greatly ease the cramped
laboratory and classroom conditions. The improvement
will also show itself in more liberal arts classrooms in
the north wing of Chambers, now occupied by the physics
department.

“We hope to occupy the building early in 1958-59,”
said Sailstad, “but how soon depends on many factors.
No exact date has been set.”
