Traveler

Contined from Page 7

fortlessly as fastand high above as
the macstro’s mouth sccs fit. You’ ll
find yoursclf looking skyward
during these sections. Popper of- -
tcn scems tQ be dragging these
guys (Shechan and Hill) bchind-

opened for last summer. “But
Anyway,” the album opener and,
in my opinion, the best track, is an
introduction to‘and a demonstra-
tion of Popper’s harmonica hero-
ics. It is also a vocal and lyrical

him and although they are never
too far behind they arc always the
first ones to cry uncle and bail out
of a crescendo. Hill is not spec-
tacular but is as solidasa bloke can
be. Shechan’s bass style (as noted
by Chip Petree) is very similar to
that of Muzz Skillings (Living
‘Colour) and Popper’s vocals of-
tentimes sound like those of that
band’s front man, Corey Glover.
(Listen to “Mulling It Over.”’)
But, as said, this band is not
jazz, though jazzy, and is defi-
nitely not hard rock like Living
Colour. These. influences are
combined, with others, into a very
unique blues/rock mesh thatis very
attractive to the ear as well as the
Allman Brothers, whom they

high point. “100 Years” is a slow
one that like side B’s “Alonc”
shows that the band’s technique is
tight enough to stand upto stand up
after scrutiny (a fact that I never
really doubted) when the tune is
slow enough to allow it. There isa
nice. poke at conservative incre-
mentalism in “Slow Change” but
other than that the Traveler plays
apolitical blues (the meanest blues
of them all).

Blues Traveler is a recording
thatis definitely worth owning and
aband definitely worth following.
