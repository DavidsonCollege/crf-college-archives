JOHN RUFFIN, CLASS OF 1965
Davidson Grad Leads Sing Out 66’ers

Hope Of A New/World

“Sing Out 66, a traveling:
musical group consisting of high
school and college young people,
invaded Chambers Auditorium
Monday evening and won the
heart of the Davidson student,
as long as they were singing
and not talking.

Presently touring this area,
“Sing Out’ sent half of its en-
tourage to Davidson to give a
taste of its full two-hour con-
cert Wednesday night at the
Charlotte Coliseum.

Seventy-five singers and mu-
sicians presented an hour of
original songs praising the vir-
tues of freedom and courage.

John Ruffin, a 1965 graduate of
Davidson, introduced the group
and gave a brief background of
the traveling group.

The group was formed at a
Moral Re - Armament Con-
ference of approximately five
thousand young people held at
Mackinac Island, Mich. in the
summer of 1965.

The purpose of the conference
“to end dictatorship and give
birth to freedom for all men;
to end pacifism and give birth
to a fighting spirit; to end racial
violence and give birth to a na-
tion that speaks with a united
voice."—gave bitth to “Sing
Out,” as the chorus was or-
ganized and produced by profes-
sional entertainers and staffed
by volunteers from the confer-
ence. A secondary purpose of
“Sing Out” is to present a new
image of American youth to
audiences throughout the world.

The group has presented shows
at the New York World’s Fair,
in the Watts section of Los An-
geles, at the Washington Hilton
Hotel, to students in Japan and
to American troops in Korea.

Following the concert a coffee ,

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Editor ;

A small, unpretentious booth in Davidson’s
only Main Street restaurant is an unlikely place
for an orchestra scherzo to be written.

But in the simple cafe during two months of
last year, Professor David Richey composed his
lively work, which was performed by the Char-
lotte Symphony Orchestra in December.

Mrs. Margaret Pratt, sole proprietor, hostess
and head waitress of the College Restaurant,
smiles as she thinks of Professor Richey’s com-
posing his scherzo right in her own cafe.

“That’s what we've been trying to promote,”
pointed out Mrs. Pratt, ‘—a real homey atmos-
phere.”

“This is a family business, with my husband
and daughter helping out, and we sort of like a
quiet, homey environment,” she remarked hap-
pily, as she poured a steaming mug of coffee.

The service is fine, too. Mrs. Pratt enjoys
talking and joking with the students who come in,
“mostly the regulars, you know.” The booths and
tables are close, and during the winter the win-
dows are almost always steamed over; both con-
tribute to the warmth of the old building.

DEEP INTEREST

Mrs. Pratt has a deep interest in the students,
perhaps because her own son is just out of school
and in the Army. “I always ask the boys if they
are looking after their studies,” she said serious-

SING-OUTER SPEAKS OUT
Object Of Talk Is Bill Alexander (R)

‘Sing-Outers’ Promise

hour was held in the Union at
which students had a chance to
meet.and talk personally with
members of the cast.
The “Sing Out" cast showed
in their talk the same devotion
to the cause which was ex-
pressed in their songs. .
The intense young men and
women denied having any ‘po-
litical, religious or economic
philosophy but believed instead
that Moral Re-Armament is
larger than any such a philoso-
phy and would provide the
means for social rehabilitation.

Based on the tenets of love,
justice, unselfishness and purity,
the Moral Re-Armament move-
ment is world wide with espe-
cially active organizations in Ja-
pan and the neutral nations.

By their performances in Ko-
rea and Japan, some members
of “Sing Out’’ felt they had an
active role in the establishment
‘of the recent Japanese-Korean
treaty. Some also stated that
they had received invitations
from U. S. military authorities
to visit and entertain American
troops in South Viet Nam.

Four Students Display
Paintings In Charlotte

Four Davidson students have 15 paintings and
drawings on display at the Charlotte Public Library
during the month of March.

Ranging from realism to abstract expression-
ism and pop, most of the work comes from mem-
bers of the advanced studio class, according to
Douglas Houchens, associate professor of fine arts.
Included also are two drawings by Nat Heyward,
made during his first month in the basic studio.

One of Heyward’s drawings called “Gesture
Study” was accepted for the 1965 Annual Exhibition
of Drawings by American Artists at Appalachian
State Teachers College in Boone.

Several paintings by Louis Hill, Woody Coleman
and Daniel Goytia following Christmas themes were
displayed at the Mutual Savings and Loan Associa-

tion last December.

“Christmas Confections,” an

abstract oil by Goytia, was awarded the second

prize.

Another of Goytia’s works, “Flying Mask,” was
included in the recent Piedmont Graphics Exhibi-
tion at the Mint Museum in Charlotte.

ly, “because I know it’s hard.”

When asked if she noticed any changes in the
type of boys over the years, she laughed, “Yes,
they didn’t have all those beards and long hair a
few years back. But I know that’s the style now,
and I guess you can't really say too much about
i aa

She hasn’t seen any change in manners and
courtesy, however. “The boys who come in are
always nice and don’t give any trouble. Davidson
boys have always been nice, though, and we never
expect trouble. It’s almost like they’re at home”.

The only change is in the appearance. “Years
ago they all wore neat clothes,” she continued,
“with creased pants and all. But now they come
in with shirttails flying.”

Mrs. Pratt buys her food locally, “So it’s all
fresh and is cooked in a home-style way, simple,
but hot and good.”

DISCOUNT

A little known fact is that Mrs. Pratt offers a
10 per cent discount to her regular college cus-
tomers. They merely sign their tickets and pay
weekly or monthly. She said that she would like
to extend the offer to more students if more
could get to know about it.

The big rush night at the College Restaurant
is Saturday, when the fraternities and the Union
dining rooms are closed. “That's when we fill up,
and I’m sorry if they have to wait, but I haven't
got but one other waitress, beside my daughter
and me,” she explained. .

“We’ve had our share of VIP’s to eat here,”
she went on. “Rep. (Charles) Jonas was here last
year, and just a few weeks ago Charlie Scott and
his family were here with Coach (Lefty) Driesell.”
She said she just laughed at one boy who told her
she should have his autograph—he’s Bill Work-
man and is now singing with an opera in New

ork.

Film Friends Present

The Brig will be presented

The director of the movie,

Tuesday by the Film Friends Jonas Mekas, :will make an ap-

as the third in its series of spe-

cial films this semester.
The Brig first appeared re-

‘ cently as an off-Broadway play.

Because the play clesed for lack
of funds, the movie was made
in the theater itself before the

g set was dismantled.

The movie, which has no plot
in the usual sense, is an exam-
ination of man's inhumanity to
man and of man's basic sad-
ism.

pearance at Davidson next
month to discuss the film. Mekas
is a well-known lecturer and
leader of a new movement in
films who is appearing in this
area for the first time. He will
bring several films with him to
illustrate his talks.

A RH I,

If communications were good enough
you could stay in the sack all day

Moving your body around
is highly inefficient.

If communications were perfect,
you would never have to.

Of course, you would stilt
have to get exercise.

But that’s your problem.

We want to make it easier for you
to contact people, learn,

get information, attend lectures,
and hold meetings.

We developed Picturephone*
service so you can see as well as talk
when you call. And be seen, too.
We introduced Tele-Lecture service
(two-way amplified phone calls)

to let you hear lecturers

in distant locations. And so you:
could ask them questions

no matter how far away they were.

Right now, many students can dial
from their dormitories to a
language lab. Soon a student

will be able to dial into a

computer thousands of miles away
to get information for his courses.

Depending on the nature

of the information, he might get
his answer back audibly,

printed on a teletypewriter,

as a video image,

or a facsimile print.

Some of these services
are available now.
Others are being tested.

For the next week or so,
better get a move on.
