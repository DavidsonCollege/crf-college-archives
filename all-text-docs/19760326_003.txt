Miscellany editors prepare
spring issue, plan ‘special’

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

Student and faculty readers

are currently evaluating sub-
missions for the spring issue of
the Miscellany according to
editors Mark Armstrong and
Chip Crawford.
_ The staff tentatively plans
to have the magazine proces-
sed and to students by the
first week in May.

“The spring issue will be a
very good issue,’’ said Craw-
ford, ‘‘but a very standard
issue.’’ The magazine will
have no graphics or photo-
graphs because these cost
more and take more time
according to him.

The staff has received sub-
missions of 325 poems and
approximately 30 short stories
from Canada, California, New
England and the Carolinas.

“We were pleased with the
material we got from the
students. We got a good deal
of stuff,’’ said Crawford.
‘‘About 75 of the poems are
from the students.”’

Armstrong and Crawford
changed printers this issue to
save costs. They expect the
appearacnce of the magazine
and the quality of the printing
to remain the same.

The editors hope to use the
extra money to publish a third
issue of the Miscellany next
year.

“We hope to put out some
special issue to try to expand
circulation and to increase
interest,’’ Crawford said.
“We'd try to come up with a
special topic so we wouldn’t
crowd the spring issue.”’

Crawford and Armstrong
feel the past Miscellanys have
handled the manuscripts well
but that the buisness has been
handled in a very lax manner.

“It’s been run like a south-
ern plantation, in a very
gentlemanly manner,”’ said
Armstrong.

They plan to set up the
business relationship with the
college in a more rigid manner
and to find out exactly what
they can and cannot do,
according to Crawford.

“We hope to get the maga-
zine more than regionally
known.” said Armstrong. He
said the best way to do this is
to increase the number of
subscribers and submissions.

The editors are considering
advertising in other literary
magazines if the cost is not too
restrictive.

‘‘We looked at the list of
Miscellanys we sent out and
we’re going to expand and
modify it,’’ said Crawford.
‘“‘There have been a lot of
overlooked places.”’

“I think we didn’t expand
our advertising enough on
campus. That’s our biggest
weakness,”’ said Armstrong.

“It went by word of mouth
pretty well, but we do need to
expand the ads. You’d have to
go looking for the announce-
ments, but they’re all over
Chambers and the library,’’ he

said.

““‘We’ve been pretty lucky in
having a steady influx of
money,’ he said. ‘‘The
problem with most small mag-
azines is that they die after
eight issues.”

‘‘Our prize money is com-
paritively high. We award
$150 for the first place poem
and short story and $50 for the
second place,’’ Armstrong
continued.

‘‘With our grant from the
Arts Council we can give a
payment for everything pub-
lished -- $2 per poem and $4
per short story. It’s kind of a
gesture, but we think it’s a
step in the right direction.”

‘‘We’re just trying to get
the magazine out on time and
to get the manuscripts back on
time because that increases
submissions,’’ said Crawford.

‘We plan to keep manu-
scripts about five weeks after
the deadline,’’ said Arm-
strong. ‘‘But we have
problems in the fall because
there will be stuff in the box
that’s been there all summer.

YMCA intends symposiums, festival

By DANA BEACH

Staff Writer
The Davidson College

YM/YWCA is instituting a
number of programs in order
to ‘‘initiate interaction be-
tween faculty and students
and members of the Davidson
community to develop new
relationships, according to
YM/YWCA president John R.
McArthur. ©

The YM/YWCA goals, said
McArthur, ‘‘Are to make it
easier for individuals to under-
stand, earn from, and enjoy
one another.”’

According to McArthur,
YM/YWCA members have
complained of a general lack of
programming and_ unity

among the organization’s var-

ious groups.
In reaction to these
criticism, McArthur is

attempting to consolidate and
expand existing programs and
augment these with new ones.

YM/YWCA symposiums
have been intensified this
year. Topics for future sym-
posiums include ‘‘Political
Aspects of Compromise,”’
“The Church in Society,” and
“Third World Hunger.”

In an attempt to extend
social life, the YM/YWCA is
planning a spring celebration
on April 2 that will include a
skateboard competition, tri-
cycle races, and kite flying. A
band will perform in the
quadrangle.

sion.

“Crawford took his division
and divided it. into five sep-
arate parts: infirmary, laun-
dry, dorms, sports, and sec-
urity,’”” said Murphey. ‘‘He’s
looking at these in terms of
what were some of the goals
and should we meet them.”

Laurie Dunn is working
with the educational aspect of
coeducation. ‘‘(The original
committee) made some pred-
ictions as to what the educa-
tional aspects of the coeds
would be. Laurie will be deter-
mining the concentration of
majors and comparison of

women vs. men grade-wise,”’
said Murphey.

Dan Thorp is talking with
freshmen and a representative
of each house on Patterson
Court to determine the social
aspects of coeducation. He will
concentrate on the number of
women in extracurricular act-
ivities according to Murphey.

‘‘A lot of that is attitu-
dinal,’’ she said.

“Davidson has never eval-
uated coeducation at all. There
has never been a formal study
done by the students to eval-
uate it and that’s why I think
Bo (SGA President Bo Bas-
kin) wants it done,”’ said Mur-

phey.

Hc vate some of the first
girls here I think we can do an
unbiased job,’’ she continued.

“We're soliciting opinions
and suggestions from anybody
we can.”

“Women who don’t admit
they have been discriminated
against are blind. I’m so
opinionated, but I know it.
That’s why I’m not on any of
the divisions,’’ Murphey said.

“But that’s not the opinion
of this committee. I think the
people who are doing the
evaluation are very honest and
if they don’t find what they
wanted to find they’ll tell the
truth.”’ |
