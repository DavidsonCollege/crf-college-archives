Georgetown Ends Ban
On Campus Drinking

By Collegiate Press Service

A rule prohibiting drinking in
dormitories has been unexpect-
edly reversed by Georgetown
University.

Officials said the new policy,
which alllows all men to keep
both beer and hard liquor in
their rooms, was designed to
help students develop personal
responsibility.

According to Rev. Anthony J.
Zeits, director of student person.
nel, authorities who have studied
the campus drinking issue have
concluded that ‘‘the formation
of young men is facilitated when
they are given the freedom to
choose whether to use or not to
use alcoholic beverages."

Georgetown officials also said
the move was made to end the
pretense of enforcing an unen-
forceable rule—a primary con-
sideration, according to several

students.
Studies of other colleges which

allow liquor on campus have

shown that “most students do
not overtindulge when allowed
to have alcoholic beverages in
their dormitories,’ Father Zeits
emphasized.

The step taken by Georgetown
is a surprising one, according
to Gerry McCullough, news ed-
itor of the student paper.

McCullough said the drinking
decision was handled quietly.
The Student Council discussed
the issue with administration of-
ficials last year. The newspaper
knew nothing of the proceedings
until the matter was settled, Mc-
Cullough said.

For the past four years, Mc-
cullough added. student leaders
have been trying to liberalize
Georgetown's policies. Dormi-
tory curfew regulations have
also been relaxed this semester,
he said.

include not only tutoring but al-

with teen-agers and other special

Emphasizing the tutorial as-

The group will stress “‘crea-

A drug scare in the Philadel-
phia area two years ago, he con-
tinues, prompted the Depart-
ments of Justice, Education and
Health to investigate drug abuse
in the state. Pennsylvania Gov-
ernor William W. Scranton took
the initial step and got the pro-
gram organized.

Questionnaires were sent to
141 college presidents asking for
suggestions as to what the state
could do. In addition, question-
naires were sent to some 150
experts in the field, psycholo-
gists and psychiatrists, asking
advice on the best ways to solve
the problems.

vides what the questionnaires
said they needed -major infor-

Abel worked in cooperation
with Smith Kline and French
Laboratories, a leading. drug
concern, compiled results of the
two quéstionnaires and explored
extensive miagazine and newspa-
per files on the subject.

Abel says, ‘‘We hope this will
just be a start of an extensive
educational program concerning
drugs and drug abuses. We tried
to get a start so it will be incor
porated in the curriculum of
high schools. to educate the stu-
dent. to the. abuses before they
are faced with the temptation.”

The deadline for contributions

damentals, Secor proceeded to
characterize the modern polit-

‘ical age. He stated that con-

temporary political power does
not come from established au-
thorities but from man himself.

Justice, Secor emphasized, has
become a physical and earthly
stability, placing political pow-
er in the creative intellect of
man. The goal then becomes
not some transcendental social
good, but security and stability.

Secor differentiated some mod-
ern political systems by show-
ing how they created stability.
Marxism, for example, tries

iscusses Role
(Of Individual In Politics

to create economic stability; the
Marxist criticizes the individual
of the West because he sees this
security only in its political
sense.

Secor pointed out that the cur-
rent political crisis is the result
of an over-emphasis on the self
of man, rather than the bipolar-
ization of the. world’s political
power,

As he began his conclusion,
he was interrupted by the clap-
ing of several members of the
student body. Secor then dis-
missed chapel before finishing
his closing comments.

to all interested persons.

The institute was founded in
1954 by the World Council of
Churches. Basically, it is a cen-
ter for research in new ap-
proaches to human problems in
today's scientific, secular and
urban society.

A large part of the institute’s
work is in training laymen to
be vanguards in modern society.

} This training takes place in in-
tensive weekend conferences.

The intensity of the pedagog-
ical methods used at the confer-
ences has caused controversy,
especially among traditional
churchmen who are shocked by
the ideas of the radically com-
mitted staff members of the in-
stitute.

There will be no charge for
transportation, and costs will be
held to a minimum. Interested
students should see Mike Bates.

Deferment Tests
Slated Next Month

Applications for the Nov. 18

Test for draft deferment are now
available in the student coun-
seling office.

A test bulletin, distributed by
the testing organization, advises
that a student register early for
the test. In this way, he stands
the best chance of being assigned
to the date he desires.

Because of the possibility of
being assigned either date, the
student. must Hst a testing cen-
ter for. each date.

The test will be administered
at Davidson on either or both
test dates depending on the num-
ber of students who register.
