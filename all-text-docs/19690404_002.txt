Motives Matter

In an interview this week President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. expressed his
opinion that the future status of
ROTC at Davidson is “not a vital is-
sue.”

We would like to disagree.

He said that it was not vital to the
future of: the college. nor was it vital
to the future of the armed forces.

We would like to say that it is vital
to the students, and that it therefore
deserves serious consideration on the
part of faculty. administration and
trustees.

Spencer’s point is well-taken. At
a time when military might is the
word of the world. it is of importance
that this generation have knowledge

Competence?

It isn’t just that the SGA committee
never made it clear to the Educational
Policy Committee their position on
using statistics. They didn’t really
have one, until the idea sort of fell
into their laps later on.

Later on, it turns out that the com-
mittee has members who actually
think ROTC should be compulsory.
It seems rather trite, but we’ll go on
and ask, Why does a committee to
abolish compulsory ROTC have mem:
bers who favor compulsory ROTC on
it?

We'll let the question of why a
committee of this importance has a
majority of freshmen on it go by.
Although we are a bit dubious of the
ability of freshmen either to sway the
administration and trustees (and, oh
yes, the faculty, too) or to be famil-
iar with the background. We will not
question the wisdom of the former
administration in the appointments.
Tis but a minor point.

But finally, it seems that the com-
mittee (1) has severe problems get-
ting enough of its members together

to meet and (2) has yet even to elect.

a chairman.

It seems -that students deserve a bit
more in the way of competence from
their representatives.

of the functioning of the military.

But we must stick to the moral
issue, and it seems that the practice
of compulsory ROTC by the college
is a means of forcing on its students
its own decision in a very questionable
moral issue — the use of violence and
force and the place of the military.

No matter what other schools have
done, regardless of figures and graphs
of student particepation in voluntary
programs on other campuses. David-
son's prgram should be examined on
its own merit and én its place within
the school's Christian commitment.

We would prefer$that the option
remain. for it would be as bad to deny
the option one way a4 the other. But
if the program does g» voluntary, and
the number of officers per year does
fall below the magic figure; and the
Army does terminate the program,
then it seems evident that the reason
for terminating the program would be
that student interest was not high
enough.

And if the program cannot attract
enough student interest to. maintain
itself, its demise is proper, for its
benefits will not be worth its costs.

We urge the faculty and the admin-
istration to reexamine the status of
ROTC on this campus, but we insist
that it be done on a moral basis, with-
out the complications of campus poli-
tical concerns.

It seems that some faculty members
feel that the Board of Trustees would
overrule a proposal for voluntary pro-
gram, and that such a ruling would
weaken the position of the Davidson
faculty. Some persons have suggested
that it is the wrong time to propose
that change, with all of the other
proposals before the board.

What seems to be forgotten, at the
risk of repetition, is the moral issue
involved. And it certainly seems that
this is what the whole program hinges
upon, not political considerations.

We look for the alternatives, but
let’s keep the motivation clear. It is
best to recall Eliot’s admonition; “The
last temptation is the greatest treason
/To do the right thing for the wrong
reason.”

Wanted: Three Coaches

The loss this week of Assistant
Coaches Terry Holland and Jerry Con-
boy has left an irreparable gap in the
Davidson athletic department.

When the top prospect for the head
coaching job was named this week a
number of team mémbers revealed
their preference for Holland, but it
was too late.

No one can blame the two for leav-
ing. People could complain about the
departure of Lefty Driesell, but with-
out a recruiting prayer, Holland and
Conboy were wise to leave.

On Being

Copyright 1969, ‘Presbyterian Survey’
Reprinted With Permission

Quietly last fall Agnes Scott College
in Decatur, Ga., restated its hiring
policy. In effect, it eliminated a re-
quirement that faculty members be
Christian. ;

A storm of controversy had arisen
months before when the impossibility
of hiring a Jewish faculty member be-
came known. Not even the American
Jewish Committee claimed that Scott
was anti-Semitic, only that its pro-
Christian definition required discrim-
inatory hiring.

All Christians are greatly indebted
to our Jewish friends for raising the
issue, and pushing us to re-think the
old question, what is a Christian col
lege?

Second ‘Coming?

A news item which bears comment
popped up recently on a campus to
the southwest — Bob Jones University
in Greenville, S. C. — requested sub-
machine guns for its security officers.

For a school whose guards some-
times have to keep students within the
barbed wire fences as well as keeping
others ‘out, the whole thing seemed
a bit scary. Fortunately the request
was denied.

Billed as the “World’s Most Unusual
University,” it looked as if Bob Jones
was really going to outdo its previous
heiehts of incredibility.

The reasons for the request were
never specifically given, but it is be-
lieved that one -Greenville.. grand-
mother was close to the solution when
she suggested that perhaps Bob Jones
himself had seen a vision that the
Secend Coming was at hand and that
the guards needed to be ready to

combat evil of all sorts.

A great deal of pessimism has been
expressed by the team for its future
under the top prospect for the job.
But the fact remains that any coach
is going to have a terrible year of re
cruiting now.

No coach in his right mind would
walk into the vacancy now. It’s just
too late.

As long as Davidson plans to carry
on its basketball program, certainly
some competence should be displayed
in the selection of a coach. So far it
hasn’t and it’s about time somebody
said so.

‘Christian’

When the American continent was
first being settled, there were no col-
leges. So Christians started them. Per-
haps that is when a college is Chris-
tian: when it is serving an educational
need of society that would otherwise
go. unmet.

To put it another way, maybe a col-
lege, like a church or an individual, is
uniquely Christian only when it em-
bodies the lifestyle of a servant.

Excellence is surely another criteria.
Colleges, like churches and individ-
uals, can hardly claim to worship God
with their minds when intellectual in-
quiry is sloppy and mediocre, or stifl-
e

Where faculty members must pro-
fess Christianity, academic excellence
could conceivably be sacrificed for
nominal Christianity.

If, as in the case of Agnes Scott, a
college proposes to offer education
“distinctly favorable to the mainte-
nance of the faith and practice of the
Christian religion,” then how?

In the turmoil of Christian educa-

tion today, where much re-thinking
and re-evaluating is being done, new
and creative answers are being formu-
lated.
. But one thing seems clear: faith
that must be nurtured in a hot house
of conformity hasn't much chance of
survival in a pluralistic society.

We're living in a time when we must
understand the deep convictions of
other faiths, including those of a se-
cular society. This need was likely
met in earlier times when Christians
numbered no more than 15 percent
of church college student bodies.

We rejoice that Agnes Scott, a pri-
ately. owned college with close ties to
the Presbyterian Church US, has shed
an embarrassing anachronism in its
continuing process of definition and
search for the truth.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Sands: Subsidized Athletics Are

Publicity Aid,

To The Editor:

Recently, my attentions
were seized by an ugly rumor
that subsidized athleti¢s may
soon become a thing of the
past at Davidson. If one
mian's opinion may be of any
significance, may 1 urge the
school to consider any move
to this effect with the atmost
scrutiny.

Perhaps it is because we
reside in the relatively dis.
tant state of Texas that the
basketball team is of such
importance to local afumni,
I suppose it is due to a search
for identity. but I certainly
fiod it a pleasant change
Trom a few years ago that
people no tonger ask -if Dav
idson is a junior college

Would {this be ‘the case if
our basketball team had not
exeelled in recent years?
Ironically. it is largely due
to publicity generated © by
our athletic accomplishments
that the name “Davidson"’
is now also linked with acad-
emic excellence.

In Texas, our school has
become better known than
other small institutions of
similar quality such as Bow-
doin, Union, Reed, Hamilton,
or Grinnell, and may .be
eclipsing even such hallqwed
names as Williams and Am-
herst in recognition by the
general public.

While fame in itself is not
entirely devoid of utility, it
must be admitted that an
unwarrented reputation would
be in conflict with the pur-
ported honesty of our Pres-
tyterian heritage.

Thus, when journalists
bond Davidson's athletic re-
putation and intellectual en-
vironment. are their. state-
ments valid, or, as many
claim. are subsidized ath-
letics a damper on an insti-
tution’s intellectual atmos
phere?

To me, it-is evident. that
at Davidson our athletic
teams have boen a progres-
sive force. Not only has our
expanding renown resulted in
a more heterogencous stu
dent body. but many athletes
are some of Davidson's best
scholars.

Additionally. it would be
ludircrous’. to believe that

nities. “in a Southern ‘school
such. as Davidson could have
occured without the influence
of the black athlete,

While many are quick to
assert that the Negro’s role
at. Davidson is very super
ficial, they must admit it is
at the least a start in the
tight direction.

On a recent visit to Dav-
idson, I was introduced to
freshman Lester Strong. a
most impressive individual.
Would he have chosen to at-
tend Davidson over Prince-
ton if it had not been for
subsidized athletics?

Two other common, argu-
ments against endowing ath-
letes are ‘economic and mor-
al. First, it would be erro-
neous to ignore the inestim-
able financial value of free
publicity generated by sport-
ing news.

FACULTY
MEETING

Was Student Sex Life
Discussed By Faculty?

To The Editor:

At the last faculty meeting
last Friday there was some
very interesting discussion.
The faculty was arguing
about the sex life of the typi-
eal student.

Half of the faculty believed
that when the students left
the college every weekend to
shack up with his girl, there
was nothing to worry about.

After all there are so many
contraceptive devices noth-
ing harmful can come off that
could hurt the school. So long
as Davidson has strict rules

pertaining to sexual activity
of students on campus, the
reputation « Davidson will
not be blemished.

The other half of the fac-
ulty said that Davidson is
responsible for educating the
student outside of the class-
room as well as in the-class.
room. Therefore anything
that might hinder the edu-
cational process should be
avoided. The question isn’t
one concerning the-reputation
of Davidson but one of saving
the soul of the Davidson stu-
dent.

This group proposed that

the Davidson student should
have to sign out every week-
end and to be allowed one
weekend away from school
a month. Of course the stu-
dent could leave campus for
vacations,

This argument went on for
an hour and a half and still
no settlement was reached.
Realizing that time was run-
ning out, the issue was put
into a special committee for
further study.

With 10 minutes !eft until
dinner the faculty decided to
put the ROTC question to
another special committee for
further study. Then the meet-
ing ended.

Is there any student who
can tell me from first-hand
knowledge that the meeting
did not go on in the ahove
manner? Obviously and un-
fortunately the answer is
“no.” :

Students are barred from
faculty meetings. Further-
more, faculty members are
not allowed to talk specific-
ally about what happened! at
the meetings. All information
of the meeting must come
from the dean of the faculty.

Trustees have a similiar,

policy.

I find this situation to be
tragic. When there are so
many issues that both stu-
dents, faculty, and trustees
fee] strongly about, any alien-
ation by these groups leads
to misconception, misinter-
pretations, false accusations,
and encourages real trouble.

Issues such as voluntary
ROTC, cars for students on
scholarship, self-scheduled ex-
ams, etc. should not in any
way be discussed by students
alone. faculty alone or trus-
tees alone. but should be dis-
cussed and decided by hav-
ing these three groups woi«
together.

I know of 0 issue where
the faculty benefits by meet
ing behind closed doors. The
same goes for students and
trustees. I write this letter
with the hope that in the
near future the students, fac-
ulty, and trustees will cease
to have any form of alien
ation since the biggest cause
of campus dissension today
is the alienation of these

groups.

On Practicing What You Preach

We've talked “student responsibility” constantly
since the passage of the Code of Responsibility last —
mie” Now it's time to talk about faculty responsi-

lity.

That same famed faculty encyclical which called
students to responsibility for their own actions has
not brought a much-needed reform in that august
assembly known to students as “The Faculty Meeting.”
Instead, faculty members have shown spectacular
blindness to the code’s implications for themselves.

__.. The most flagrant abuse of the spirit of the code
is the maintenance of closed faculty meetings in the
face of the code itself: ... “The aim of this code is
to encourage individuals to develop responsible judg-
ment capable of directing their conduct with a mini-
mum of specific prohibitions . . . . Rather, responsible
maturity is more likely to develop when a member of
the college community is both free and obligated to
wrestle with principles of conduct and to accept full
responsibility for his own actions and decisions.”

Explanations for maintenance of the rule have
been unsatisfactory:

“Well, students ought to know we have their in-
terests at heart.”

“Faculty members need the meeting the way
they are to insure the ‘best’ consideration of issues.
If they were open some faculty members would play
to the galleries and others wouldn't feel free to speak
what they thought.

Or how about

important to students — it has moved itself out of
all seial questions. carriculum and acadetnics.you
say? , yes, but that’s solely the re ibili

the faculty” ly the responsibility of

Or this gem:

—"Faculty members don’t want students to know
what they say about things — surely you can see that
that sort of thing would come between teachers and
their students.”

Overall, the position of the faculty seems inconsis-
tent. To say that a member of the college community
must “accept full responsibility for his own actions
and decisions” and then to procede in closed session
borders on hypocrisy.

The arguments for freedom of discussion and
concern, for student-faculty rapport appear to have
some validity. But what things that need to be said
in meetings could not be said before students or in
closed session when professional or highly confiden-
tial matters were under discussion?

The student-faculty friction that might arise
through student knowledge of faculty members’ posi-
tions on various questions appears to be much less
severe than under present conditions when students
plained to decisions that go completely unex-

Deliberation and action of student groups are
open to reporting in the student press. Student gov-
ernment works on the premise that their responsibil-
ity to the college community dictates that their ac-
tions and decision-making be open to public view.

Though students may plead and persuade, stu-
dents have no direct say in policy making for the cok

(Students have been granted permission to witness

faculty meetings at some high schools.).

___And it certainly wouldn’t be difficult to argue,
since proponents could quote the faculty’s own stated
principles in support of the change.

And if the faculty can’t see its way clear to such
a change on their own, students may once again have
to hit the long legalistic trail, this time under a pro-
vision of the code: “Complaints against students for
alleged violations of the code should be made to the
