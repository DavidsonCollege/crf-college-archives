Holland Describes ‘The Castle,’

From The ‘Sweet’ To The ‘Raw’

One of the most memorable
parts of the recent faculty
trip to Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, was the visit to the
United States Detention Bar-
racks. J. Gill Holland, Assis
tant Professor of English,
related the experiences which
follow and said he bet such
a visit there or to a closer
prison would make some stu
dents consider penology as
a vocation.

Take the sweeter and more
civilized things first and then
the raw stuff which came out
clearer at lunch after the
morning tour.

Inside the wall the warden,
an Army colonel, briefed the
group first and began, ‘‘Gent
lemen, our population this
morning was 1277."’ The colo
nel went over a number of
things. such as the possibili
ties of rehabilitation from
learning trades to taking col

lege

courses (“If his sen
tence is long enough he gets
in. Associate in Arts De
gree.)

Next an Army. lieutenant
colonel showed the visitors
through trade shops where
inmates were learning up-
holstery, electrical repair

work and so on; the brightest
inmates even had a computer
to study.

Next was the seven-wing
building housing the cell
blocks, which was affection
ately known as the Castle
The Air Force major in
charge there took the visitors
by, cells, the mess hall, the
gymnasium, and the chapels;

so they got a little more of
the feel of life’on the inside.

Sometimes you could see
the individuality of the men
that lived there: Rodriguez,
B. 48191, had added “The
Rod” above his name, and an
artist had painted attractive
sylvan scenes of streams
and running deer in the mess
hall (the colonel's slide show
revealed he had painted over
two signs on the wall: DO
NOT ACCEPT MORE FOOD
THAN YOU CAN EAT EAT
ALL YOU ACCEPT).

In the Catholic chapel a
counterfeiter had printed
scenes from the life of Christ
The . priest explained they
were not original; he. prefer
red copying

In the Protestant chapel
there were no services for
Presbyterfans held: they were
included in a gatch-all ser
vice. The priest told Dr. Da-
vidson that there Were no
Presbyterians there

Outside the Castle the group

health in the USDB (across

tentiary there is one psychia-
trist in. charge of 2500 in

Holland said he was a little
perplexed. because at first
th® talk was about the mental
hygiene of the guards rather
than the inmates.

For example; one success
ful technique involved the
help of a Negro inmate who

had: volunteered to play the
role of a black militant. He
confronted two new guards,
one white and one Negro,
and verbally burned them up;

then he called it off, and
they talked over the
experience. A week later’ a
real black militant tried it
in the Castle for real and
they could handle it.

In any case, the concern
with the guards’ mental well
being was ‘a little clearer

when you realized they car
ried no weapons and were of

an average age of 19

At lunch at the Prison
Farm Colony outside the
walls Holland said he was
lucky enough to be at the

table with major in charge

of the Castle and learn what

the officers as well as the
guards really had on_ their
hands

The major remarked that
his work was often depress

But your best men are the

THE REAL EU-HALL ETCHINGS
Davidson and Park display new library gift.

ABORTION SYMPOSIUM

rints”
Given .

Fifty-one etchings by the
late Louis Orr, world - re-
nowned etcher, are on dis-
play in the Lobby of the
Davidson College -Library.

The set, entitled ‘‘Etchings
of North Carolina,’’ was pre-
sented to the coilege by
Thomas Franklin Staley of
the Class of 1924, and in-
cludes an engraving of the
Eumanean Hall at Davidson
College and a large print of

the North Carolina State
Capitol.
Louis Orr, 1879-1966, was

regarded by some as one of
thegreatest etchers of all
time. During the First World
War, Orr was made a mem-
ber of the French Legion of
Honor for his remarkable
etchings of Rheims cathe-
dral, made while the afea
was ‘under German artillery
bombardment in 1917.

“A Question Of Life Or Death’ —

By STEPHEN ROADY
Staff Writer”

“Abortion: A Question of
Life or Death,”’ a symposium
sponsored jointly by, the
Richardson Fellowship Pro

on Wed., Oct. 22 at 8 p. m.
in Hodson Hall.

As stated in the’ publicity
brochure, the symposium “‘is

Williams Asks Suspension
Of Examination Program

At the next meeting of the
faculty, Dr. T. A. Williams,
associate professor of
French, intends to move to
suspend Area Examinations
“pending study of alternate
plans.”

In a special report given
to the faculty, Williams
claims that the Area Exam
inations do not constitute a
new educational experience.
The - students preparing to
take the exams ‘‘still had to
read someone else's list of
books, guess what someone
else would think was impor-
tant, write answers which
would prove acceptable in
someone's else's eyes.’

Williams adds that the easy

questions in the language,
literature, and the arts Area
Examination are so compli-
cated that ‘only a specialist
could really answer
well.) Yet he maintains that
“any bull artist can pass”
them.

On the same exam, Wil
liams points out, the essays
are followed by identifica
tion, designed to show
whether or not the student
has really read the material.
But most of the students will
pass anyway, because, Wil-
liams says, ‘‘It’s hard for a
man with a Ph.D. to fail a
freshman or sophomore for
not knowing the answers to

questions which he would

orientation of the sophomore
class to area exams, the re-
strictive time limit of two
years, and the. absoluteness
of the area exam require-
ment with no alternatives”
as reasons for its accept-
ance.

His report also criticized
“the application of the full
force of the area exam re-
quirement while their con-
tent and nature are still ex-
perimental and the wide dis-
parity between intent and ef-
fect concerning the purpose
of the exams.”

Dick Le Van said _ that
“discouragement from up-
perrclassmen"’ who did not

have to take the tests placed
another burden on the sopho-
more class.

Clodfelter said that the
chances were slim that all
elements of his proposal
would be adopted but ex-
pressed optimism about the
sincerity of the faculty's de-
sire to re-evaluate the pro-

gram.
(More than 80 sophomores
attended the Wednesday
meeting even though all

doors to Chambers basement
were locked, forcing partici-
pants to enter through Love.

The class will meet again
on October 22 or at an ear-
lier date in response to fac-
ulty action.

have a hard time answering
himself.”

Williams expresses sym-
pathy for the student who
conscientiously tries to pre
pare for the Area Examina
tions. “‘In his place,” he
says, “I would be. outraged
by the exams-—outraged by
the excessive time required
for preparation, outraged by
questions which in some
areas don’t match the possi-
bilities of preparation (liter-
ature and the arts) and in
others depend more on pho-

tographic recall than any-
thing else.

“But beyond that,’ Wil-
liams continues, ‘I would

be ‘struck dumb with fury
when it findlly occurred to
me, as it surely would, that
the faculty understands all
of these things as clearly as
I do, but has not done any-
thing about it except decide
tacitly to be as sloppily per-
missive in the grading of the
exams as it was in the mak-
ing of them.”

He notes one of the major
arguments in favor of the
Area Examinations concern:
ed the 3-3-2 arrangement, un-
der which the student takes
three courses in the fall and
winter terms and two courses
in the spring term.

According to supporters of
Area Exams, he says, “‘low-
er faculty load, semester
leaves, student internships,
etc. require the 3-3-2. The
3-3-2 can be justified only if
we have the Area Exams.
We want to keep the leaves
and internships, so we're
stuck with the Area Exams.
If we eliminated the exams

the faculty. have not done
anything that they can to
help students prepare.

“The whole idea of the
area examinations is a new
type of learning experience
at Davidson. We are trying
to break down the tradition-
al identification of education
with the classroom experi-
ence: Many students seem
unable to handle the idea of
responsibility without guide-
lines. mm

‘Many students fail to see
how ‘courses and the read-
ing on the bibliographies are
related to the examinations.

and did not put a __ third
course back in, students
might loaf, in the spring.’

Williams, however, main-
tains that “there is no neces-
sary connection between the
two course spring and the
Area Exams. We could easi-
ly have one without the oth
er, or. neither,’

He cites. three questions
which he maintains must be
answered. ‘‘Why did we want
to remake the curriculum?
Is the activity called Area
Exams consistent with our
intention? Can't we use the
time they take up in ways
which are consistent with our
intentions?” Q

the abortion controversy.

“The effective combination’

of relevant fact and thought-
ful opinion will help to shat-
ter the myths while provok
ing deeper thought about the
agonizing dilemma of abor-
tion—a matter of life or
death.”

Dr. John Asher, a gradu
ate of Harvard ~~ Medical
School who presently serves
as the director of Abortion
Surveillance at Grady Me-
morial Hospital in Atlanta,
will open the symposium
with a brief talk concerning
the current state of the abor-
tion.problem.

Asher will then shpw two
short films, one of which
will be a video-taped inter-

view with a woman who had
a therapeutic abortion at
Grady Hospital.

Following the films, a
panel of men from the three
broad “areaS on which the
abortion problem impinges
will answer questions from
the audience,

This panel will Consist of

Junior Jimmy _ Trussell,
who organized the sym-
posium, said that the pur-

pose of the symposium is to
bring the abortion problem
out into the open.

He said that an estimated
1.2 million illegal .abortions
take place in=-the- United

ROTC Goes On
As 90 Drop It

By BILL ESKRIDGE
Staff Writer

Colonel Virgil P. Foster,
the head of Davidson's ROTC
Department, noted that 160
sophomores had elected to
continue ROTC this year.
This figure represents a drop
of only 90 students, from last
year’s enrollment of 250 men
in freshman ROTC.

off the main streets, where
Americans rarely go, my
camera does the communi-

believe the camera captures
their spirit, and refuse to

like it. And the kids love it.

The streets are alive with
pbotographic potential. Every
conceivable activity takes
place in the streets: people
sleep there, they have their
hair cut there, they conduct
their business, they urinate.

The building style is con-
ductive to this: most houses
have no front wall,.nor door.
Just a collapsing metal gate.
The whole building opens on-
to the street. At night the

For some the responsibility
and independence is a very
exciting experience. For
others it is unexciting and
threatening.

Polley. expects the exami-
nations to improve and
maintains that the assump-
tion underlying them _ is
valid. ‘‘With the distribution
requirements and the area
exams we are attempting to
develop a new liberal arts
approach,

people just drive their Hon-
das and automobiles into the
living room and pull the
gate closed.

Shopkeepers display all
their goods on the street.
Every corner has a mo-
bile restaurant. A small
Stand that features soft
drinks and spiced food. Fre-
quently the proprietor tends
a small charcoal fire for
cleaning utensils and _heat-
ing food. Mechanics take
their tools to a vacant cor-
ner and voila, a garage for
ailing Hondas.

The vibrancy of the street
life affects anyone who ven-
tures into the middle of it.
One has to banter with the
people and laugh with thém
when they’re amused by a
person speaking Vietnamese
with a Carolina accent. ,

When questioned on the
reasons for continuing ROTC,
Foster concluded, ‘‘Well,
these men are motivated to
continue their ROTC train-
ing so that they can_parti-
cipate in the last two years
of the program, for which
they are paid $50 a month,
and eventually receive a
commission in the army.”

Foster went on to say, ‘‘An
added attraction this year is
the 59 leadership positions
that will be open to-sopho-
mores. And by the spring
this number will be between
64 and 69." :

Although the drop-add pro-
cedure for ROTC is essen-
tially the same as for other
courses, Major Frederick E.
Brigham, the MS II instruc-
tor, noted that some confu-
sion resulted from the sche-
duling of drills.

Briham also pointed out
that, according to a poll he
was taking, better than 50%
of the 90 sophomores drop-
ping ROTC are pre-med stu-
dents.

Therefore, the ROTC pro-
gram at Davidson seems to
be much alive in spite of
speculation that the program
would be mortally damaged
now that ROTC is voluntary.

Cumming Writes
‘Heritage’ Article

Professor emeritus of Eng
lish William P. Cumming has
linked early American his
tory with English Tudor lit
erature.

Cumming has brought to
light the fact that Hugh Per-
cy, Earl of Northumberland
and a relative of the famous
“Harry Hotspur’ immorta-
lized by Shakespeare in Hen
ry IV, prevented a_ disas-
trous defeat of the British
during their retreat from
Lexington and the pursuing
American rebels.

form the discovery of a map
and some letters written by
Percy.

During the hectic British
retreat, Percy changed the
route of march to avoid sus-
pected heavy resistance at a
key bridge over the Charles -
River at Cambridge.

Cumming discovered the
map showing the route of re-
treat in a portfolio of maps
collected by Percy and com-
piled monthly by the present
earl of Northumberland. The
collection had been stored in
Alnwick ~Castle untouched
since the death of Percy.
