THE DAVIDSONIAN' CAMPUS LIVING MONDAY, MARCH 11,1991

Student Recital Sends Sparks

By John Morris

On the evening of Thursday,
February 21, some of the
Davidson’s finest musicians de-
scended upon Love Auditorium
for a fine display of talent in an
hour and a half of performances.
Yes, our own students, some of the
people that you run into every
single day, donned the garb of high
class performers and displayed the
dazzling talent that shines in the
music department. After Thursday
night, I have decided that there are
some future virtuosos on campus.

The program began witha bang
when the Renaissance Ensemble,
clothed in appropriate Renaissance
regalia, recreated songs and dances
from over 400 years ago. Here,
dancers pranced with great appli-
cation, harpsichords twinkled
across the centuries, and the voices
of fair, virtuous maidens lived once
again. Somehow the slide into the
next performance (after an infor-
mal change of instruments by
Davidson’s own roadies) seemed
effortless; Kathryn McDaniel’s
performance of a Debussy piece
(which was written over 300 years
after the Renaissance selection)
was a simple jump in time, given
McDaniel’s lyrical performance.
Equally as lyrical was Julia Boyd’s
following performance of Finzi’s
Three Bagatelles for clarinet, and
the accompaniments of Regina
Graham and Janice Bradner on
piano were a highlight of the entire
evening.

Eclecticism artfully reigned
again when Curt Perkins and
Timisha Barnes gave a moving
rendition of “We’ll Go Away
Together” from Kurt Weill’s Street
Scene. Love Auditorium really
lived up to its name at this point,
for the tragic and poignant per-
formance made the stage seem to
be a tiny microcosm for lovers.
And the first half of the recital
ended with a bang, when Kim
Strawser’s fingers danced like
Baryshnikov over the keys with
the guidance of Chopin’s Scherzo
in B minor, Opus 20. If only we
could make ourselves very tiny
and hide inside the piano when-
ever Kim practices, for she has
quite a talent.

The mighty-mite of the cello
joined forces with the viceroy of
violin in the second half’s opening
piece when Martha Iwamoto and
Josh Hickman performed the
“Molto allegro ed agitato” from
Mendelssohn’s Trio, Opus 49.
And, as if the evening wasn’t di-
verse €nough already, the lucky
audience then witnessed Heather
Westand her Zauberflote (“magic
flute,” see Mozart’s.The Magic
Flute, see it now) perform a Con-
ertino for flute by Chaminade.
Debussy reentered the program
thanks to Cheryl Dunbar’s strong
performance of that composer’s
“Prelude Pour le Piano,” while
the evening ended with yetanother
bang when the Opera Workshop
presented “I present Miss Despi-

netta” from Mozart’s opera Cosi
FanTutti. This performance proved
that Davidson’s musicians also
know how to be comedians, for
they delivered Mozart’s comedy
well.

The whole show was a suc-
cess.

Yetone thing was lacking from
Thursday night’s performance.
That was, I am sorry to say, an
audience of members of the stu-
dent body. Perhaps Davidson stu-
dents don’t believe they have any
ability at all in the arts. Perhaps
both the “liberal” and the “arts”
should be removed from the
Davidson aura, to be replaced with
“Boring Apathy.” Opinions on
liberality differ from individual to
individual, yet I believe that the
arts, in Davidson, must thrive
regardless of student’s personal
taste. (I have taken this opportu-
nity to get into a pulpit and preach,
so bear with me; I suppose I’m
joining Will Montgomery in his
“Let’s Put the arts back in Liberal
Arts” campaign.) It is interesting
to me how one performance like
this could convert the disbeliev-
ing, if only the disbelieving and the
uninitiated would show up once in
a while. But let’s not end this
article with me sounding like Jon-
athan Edwards and the rest of the
school sounding like the “sinners
in the hand’s of an angry preten-
tious aesthete.” I want to thank all
of those performers for a tremen-
dous job.

The Incredible Ease Of Well-Being
Sue Reade's Women And Nutrition

By Marlo Cobb

The Committee for Women's
Issues thanks Sue Reade fora very
informative lecture last Thursday
night. Ifyou -couldn’t make it,
here’s some of what you missed:

On iron: Over .1/3. of all
women are deficient in some vita-
min or mineral. Iron deficiency is
more common in women than in
men. If you need to increase iron in
your diet, avoid coffee, tea, and
calcium, zinc and magnesium
supplements with iron-containing

foods. These all inhibit iron ab-.

sorbtion. In other words, don’t take
iron supplements with milk. Take
them with orange juice; vitamin C
taken with iron helps you toabsorb

more. Cooking in a cast iron pan
will add iron to your food, as well.

Vegetarians may have more of
a problem with iron deficiency
since 33% of the iron in animal
sources can be absorbed by the
body, but only 2% of the iron in
vegetable sources can:

When taking supplements,
make sure you’re not getting over
150%. US RDA on anything; this
can be dangerous. For example,
five times the US RDA of vitamin
A can damage the liver and cause
birth defects, and ten times the US
RDA of vitamin B6 may cause
damage to nerves and paralysis.

On PMS: 90% of women in
the U.S. report some symptoms of
PMS, and48% say their symptoms
are severe enough to disrupt their
lives. PMS occurs within the last
two weeks before a period and
involves one or more.of the fol-
lowing: Headache, depression,
mood swings, fatigue, anxiety,
breast soreness, bloating, a crav-
ing for salt, and weight gain. The
average woman needs 350 more
calories per day the week before
her period, but her metabolism
may be lower than normal the week
after. Exercise will relieve some

anxiety.
Osteoporosis: 25% of women -
develop osteoporosis, which is .

simply . decreased bone. tissue.
Bones become brittle and fracture
more easily.

The age of 24 is when bone
stops developing, soonce you lose
bone tissue after this age, itcannot
be replaced. Because of this it is
important that: women make sure
they are getting enough calcium
daily (for women 11-24 years, 4
servings of high-calcium foods like
milk, yogurt or cheese).

Alcoholand some medications
like tetracycline lessen calcium
absorption. Tums, which is cal-
cium carbonate, makes a good
calcium supplement. Kale and
broccoli are calcium sources, be-
sides the obvious dairy products.

Other stuff: Exercise is more
important than diet for keeping
weight off. Muscle tissue (built
through exercise) burns calories;
fat tissue is basically inactive.

Witha“lightactivity” lifestyle,
you should be eating 1600-2400
calories per day if you are female,
and 2300-3100 calories per i if
you are male,

Itis ainyih that the bubbles in.

soft, drinks make you “fatter” by

. Causing you to retain water. High,

sodium content would cause that,
but soft drinks are low in sodium.

Paris-dise

By Catherine Mullins

It is difficult to sum up in a
small space the semester I spent
in Paris with Jackie Carberry and
Christy Frierson. It was by far the
most educational and enjoyable
four months of my life. The three
of us rented ‘a tiny apartment in
the seventh arrondissement of
Paris, right behind Les Invalides.
Under the direction of Wesleyan
University, we took classes in
French with other American stu-
dents ata school called Reid Hall,
two metro stops from our flat.

_ Living in Paris was an expe-
rience in itself. Once we got used
to snooty Parisians and exorbi-
tant costs, we were able to enjoy
the thrill of living in such a cul-
ture-rich and diverse city. Any-
one who has spent any time at all
in Paris knows that you could
spend a lifetime there and not
come close to seeing all there isto

see.

We took full advantage of
Paris’ cultural resources, includ-
ing the museums, the opera, the
theatre, the cathedrals, the
monuments, etc... Looking back
on it, however, my best memo-
ries are of the times we spent
walking around people-watch-
ing, along the Seine and in the
beautiful parks like the Luxem-
bourg Gardens.

With Eurail Pass, back-
pack, and Let’s Go Europe in
hand, we setoutevery weekend
to travel around Europe. We
covered France, Spain, Italy,
Portugal, Germany, the Nether-
lands, Belguim, Czechoslova-
kia, Hungary, Austria, and
Switzerland.

Our travels were -hilari-
ously adventurous, at times
hellishly frustrating, as we
floundered our way around
Europe doing everything in our
power to overcome such ob-
staclesas language barriers, con-
fusing public transportation sys-
tems, and youth hostel curfews.
We did some hiking too, inthe
Swiss and Austrian Alps, along
the Italian Riviera, and in the
Black Forest of Germany.
_.._Ithinkeveryone should take
full advantage of any such op-..
portunity to live, study, and
travel abroad. It wasaonce ina
lifetime experience. that I will
never forget.

and you will find it.” The Cure has
made no contribution to anything
except their wallets with this disc
(it has done very well on the col-
lege charts) and it was ridiculous
of Pete to ask for it.

If you solved the above mys-
tery, youmay havealready guessed
from the disc’s title that it is com-
posed of old Cure songs remixed.

There afte only two songs that

weren’t totalled in this wreck of a ~
disc, “Never Enough (Big Mix)’ I

must admit is very hot. (Conse-
quently, it's the only tune using
realinstruments.) Andthe extended
mix of “Fascination Street” en-
hancesall that was ¢ery and disen-
tagratory in that song. But you
wouldn’t buy a CD for two tracks
would you? (See the lastreview
that should’ve been titled’ ““Deee-

Lite is Deee-Lightweight” but
wasn’t.) Anyway that particular
“Fascination Street” mix has al-
ready been used on the mini-CD of
that name.

“The Walk (Everything Mix”
and “Love Song (Extended Mix)”
are fairly true to the originals, i.e.
not marred by thin drum tracks,
overdubbing and chorus, and are
almost listenable but a few good
Cure tunes have been completely
tuined. for: me. The. “Lullaby”
remake sucks. The same goes for
“In Between Days.”.

» If you like the regular. ver-
sions of these songs leave theroom
or party when the remixes come
on. “A Forest” had a lot of remix
potential and witha name like the
“Tree Mix” I thought it would be
hot. Not. Not even close. Z

Wait until you see this one in
the discount CD box at the front of
the store.
