Sex and the bubble

Sometime between John Winthrop’s con-
cept of a delightfully Puritan “City on a
Hill” and Britney Spears’ oh-so-steamy
“Toxic” video, Americans
decided it was okay to talk
about sex. Sort of. We’re FF
slowly departing from the § '
notion that sex has to be @&
taboo, a topic to be avoided |
in polite company or in a col- |
lege newspaper. If Carrie |
Bradshaw taught us any- ©
thing, it was that talking
about sex cannot be all’
bad. :
But many of us don’t yet
feel open enough to talk about
our sexuality in a way Dr.
Ruth (Westheimer) would A
hope we could. Hopefully, /j

foster a growing comfort’
with issues relating to sex.

GOT QUESTIONS?

What do you do? Get a single, drop the
meal plan, forget the Court, and cozy up in
your basement carrel for thesis fun-time.

around him, and we
can’t even make eye

Be not ashamed, for yours is the prototyp-
ical Davidson dilemma! How many combi-
nations of hook-ups can a school of 1,700
have? There are no statistics, but I’d proffer
that the number of cans of “Beast” con-
sumed on the Court is in direct proportion to
the number of shady love-encounters. Try to
figure that one out, Math Department.

The same things we all love about
Davidson academically—small classes,
knowing everyone—can ruin it socially.
There are only so many hook-ups one stu-
dent can have at Davidson before you find
that you’ve run the gamut and feel uncom-
fortable everywhere.

Odds are that if you
have a drunken Court
hook-up with another student here, you will
encounter him. Best advice, besides avoid-
ing it or going on a date instead, is to try to
make the best of an uncomfortable situation.
Say hi, and try to remember life pre-sketchy
rendezvous.

Just because you have hooked up does not
mean you are incapable of comprehensible
communication or ordinary human interac-
tion.

Talk it out, and, most likely, you can both
have a sense of some normalcy again.

Hopefully.

Sexually,

Album Review: The Academy Is “Almost Here”

By Ty WHITE
Staff Writer

“Attention, attention: may I have all your
eyes and ears to the front of the room, if only
for one second, will you hear what I have to
say?”

The Academy Is isn’t going to shove their
lyrics down your throat, but the tales they
weave catch you from the first word of the
album.

The debut release from this Chicago-based
quintet, entitled “Almost Here,” is an album
very much about being themselves: young,
ambitious, intelligent musicians. It holds
tales of love and loss, of success and failure,
and of growing up.

In terms of sound, picture Yellowcard
(who. originated on the same label, Fueled
By Ramen) with edgier, more intelligent
lyrics, heavier guitars, and a funkier rhythm.

The album begins with “Attention,” a song
of one-sided love being turned away. Singer

William Beckett belts out, “Did I mention '

when I see you it stings like hell due to the
fact that we could have something that’ll
never happen?”

He quickly regroups his emotions for the
second song, “Season,” a confident anthem

about his band being on the up-and-up. “I'll The Chicage based quintet released their album “Almost Here” this year.

sing you something you won’t forget,”
Beckett challenges. And he follows through
on his promise throughout the rest of the
album.

Beckett continually finds ways to weave
music-making together with relationships.
In “Slow Down,” he sings of leaving a girl
because she’s too wrapped up in the material
world.

What makes the song a gem is that the
music follows the storyline so closely. As he
gets enraged with her and tries to leave, the
tempo increases. As she reels him back in,
trying to calm him down, the music slows to
a lullaby.

The first single, “Classifieds,” questions

their backs on
each other. It g 7"

intentions with each other.

Beckett doesn’t tiptoe around the question
of, “If I die in my sleep, are you still willing
to be everything you promised you would
be?” There’s no Julia-Roberts-movie answer
of “Yes, darling, of course,” just frustration
with the fact that we have no way of know-
ing for sure.

Perhaps the most touching song of the
album is “Down and Out.” Beckett sings of
broken homes and moving away from
friends. In his words, “The writers weren’t
kidding about how all good ings must
end.”

It is an ode to “Weekend warriors and our
best friends. The writers weren’t kid-
. ding, but the good
4 things will
live in our
hearts.”

The album ends with a prophecy that few
will refute: “Our time is almost here.” Look
for this young band to make waves in the
music world. They recognize they are not at
the peak of their career yet. While they’re
confident they’ Il get there, they are not there
yet.

One problem they still have is they refrain.
from displaying their full musical talents at
times. There are a few instances throughout
the album where a guitar solo could be
ripped, but they simply repeat the riff.

Another problem is merely personal pref-

erence. The album ends on a seemingly

forced song.

The rest of the album flows like a Salinger
novel, but the last song, the title track to the
album, no less, is forced into being a final
musical crescendo. While it is an upbeat
song, and it is lyrically appropriate for the
end of the album, the energy put into it is a
bit overdone.

This energy, generally used Spieondatcly
both on the album and in their live shows,
could even get your parents singing along
while they cruise in your dad’s mid-life cri-
sis convertible.

Give these guys a shot and they’ Il give you
everything they’ ve got.
