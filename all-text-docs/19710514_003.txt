Speaking on the topic ‘'Por-

form’ to a large audience
in Love Auditorium, Gal-
braith qaalled for an end to
U.S. intervention overseas
and a more rational approach
to, real issues in the third
world.

He began by reviewing

Exam Mechanics Evoke >
Few Faculty Suggestions

By DOUG BROWN
Ass’t. Managing Editor

A survey conducted by
Director of Instructional De
velopmen. Jay H. Ostwalt
shows that jhe faculty va
general has no strong’ ieel
ings one way or ithe cothor
on the new sell-Sebheduled
exams firs insutu ed due ng
the exam porwd for ise
winter term. ;

.

Or the 87 faculty membcrs
at Davidson, 57 were survey
ed about (heir opinions on
self i- scheduled exams.

Twonmy-eight faculiy mem-

bers felt that the administra- >

tion: of the exams could be
simplified, but they were
unable for the most part to
offer suggestions on ‘how it
could be simplified.

On the other hand, 29 felt
that the established  pro-
cedure should: be followed in
the future. ‘‘There is mot
much real evidence in favor
of changing the mechanics
of “Self-scheduled exams,’
said Ostwalt.

Another question attempted
to evaluate any changes in
the amount of time needed
to grade exams. Most pro-
fessors felt that about as
much time was required to
grade exams ‘as previously.
A few felt it took less time,
and they were cancelled out
by those who felt that it
took more time.

“Some faculty members
mentioned the inconvenience
of turning exams in one
. week before the exam period
“to the mnegistrar’s office,”
noted Ostwailt.

Twenty-seven wanted the
length of the exam period
to be one pre-exam day and
four days for'exams. Thwenty-
one wanted only three days
for exams and one pre-exam
day, ‘and three wanted five
exam days and one pre-exam
day.

One question queried the
faculty on student behavior

and whether the Honor Code
had becn put under stress,
It was believed by 47 that

“This poll said two things,”

As a member of the Ken-
nedy administration, >Gal-
braith pointed to the Cuban
missile crisis as the wanst
blunder of tthe early 1960's,
“one which showed not
strength in our policies but
rather our catastrophic weak-
nesses,"'

He said that communist
relations with the U.S. ém.-
proved in the 1960's steadily
because the idea of ‘ta com-
munist political monolith
against the free world be-
came outdated.

“Foreign policy was a
Weapon in ‘the larger conflict
of the cold war. This con-
flict is now largely dissolved.
The communist world has
been as divided ias the non-
communist world, -Sino-Soviet
relations are much more
poorly coordinaibed than say,
those between the United
States and Fraince.’’

Galbraith then directed his
abtention to ‘‘a change in the
substance of world affairs.

“In the beginning of the
decade each country was
capable of destroying the
other. At the end of the de-
cade each country was cap-
able of destroying the other
one five times. This. is not
mathematically decisive,"’

Galbraith said, ‘The disaster

has come to be in the third

Indochina especially. Lt was

Marr Suggests Methods
For Educational Reform

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor

Emphasis on students and
specification of educational
objectives were ‘the topics of
discussion at an Open End,
held last Monday in the Un-
ion Bar.

Approximately a dozen stu
dents and facul.y questioned
senior Hugh Marr on class
room educational theory.

Marr said that @mphasiz-
ing the student and specifica
tion of educational objec-
ives are two basic ways of

improving classroom — tech-
nique.

Marr. said that since cours-
es were given for students,
courses should be designed
with students in mind.

“One professor, in answer
to a questionnaire, said that
it.was a status symbol among
the faculty at Davidson to be
known as a ‘hard professor’,”’
he said.

“This is ‘an example of the

emphasis of a course being

onthe wrong thing. A profes-
or should consider what his

students get out of a course,
not how hard iit is.”

Another problem in class
room education,. said Marr,
is unspecified objectives.

Many times. ‘‘students just
don't know what to ledinn or
what is expected of itivem,”
stated Marr.

afoul of history.''

He tadded, ‘‘Foneign policy
is ‘a gentlemanly profession
which sets much weight on
tradition ‘and continuity, but
it has been based on many
wrong \assumptions.'’

‘He listed four iessons that
the U.S.. could lear from.
First of these is ‘the Mmits
on our power, We have suf-
fered from the Marshall plan
— that the U.S.

only thing missing after
World War II in Europe was
capital.

“But where there js a lack
of industrial base, the econ-
omy will not respond to an
influx of capital. The super-
power which seeks to inter-
Vvene in the third world re-
mains subject to the techni-
cal vacuum in the rest of the
world.

The second lesson is that
“only in a very advanced
stage .of technology is dapi-
talism worthwhile. Whether
rural, underdeveloped coun-
tries call themselves free,
democnatic or whatever, this
type of Jabeling has only
terminological significance.'’

The third lesson is that
‘although development of
countnies is beyond help, ef-
forts to influence develop-
ment bring in a large civilian
buneauanacy.

“Influencing the heats

‘and minds of people is

frustrating. Whereas in Viet-
nam and aes the frustnat-
ion ‘has been great, - the
bureaucracy has ‘been infi-

_iite.’

The final lesson is that ‘an
oversdas bureaucnacy’ deve-
lops ia ‘life and purpose of its
own, under marginal control
of ithe administration at
home,”’

Galbraith said an ‘‘over-
seas bureaucnacy has «auto
nomy to do whatever it is
doing, and it will madntain
such an inertial thrust to
continue in its course.”

Turning specifically to the
war in Vietnam, Galbraith
