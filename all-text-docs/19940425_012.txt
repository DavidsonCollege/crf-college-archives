Some
summer
shows worth
waiting for

After eight months and twenty
articles, my journalistic year has
come to aclose. As much as I’d
hoped to keep my column within
the boundaries of an arts review,
I’mafraid I’ ve waxeda little philo-
sophical from time to time.

I apologize, but music, espe-
cially country, is such a phenom-
enon, that I think we have to prac-
tice a little layman’s philosophy in
order to put a finger on it. Like
love or laughter, we really can’t
explain why music touches us so
deeply. With that in mind, "Still
Whistlin’ Dixie" is as. much my
effort to explain that unexplain-
able curiosity as it is to let you
know what’s out there worth hear-
ing.

And considering you’ll be

Still Whistlin’
Dixie
with Geoff Graham

deprived of my sage advice for
upwards of three months, I thought
I'd leave you with a little wisdom
and guidance for the long, hot sum-
mer ahead.

As far as tours to look for,
Alan Jackson, Hal Ketchum, and
Dwight Yoakam will probably be
the hottest tickets of the summer.
If I had to choose, I think I’d take
Dwight, but I’ll probably just starve
for a week so I can save up for all
three.

Steve Earl recently released a
greatest hits album, so if we’re
lucky, he might take to the tour bus
again. In a similar vain, keep a
look out for David Allan Coe. He’s
always playing somewhere.

Rumor has it, Radney Foster
is on the road again, so if you hear
anything more, let me know. I’d
sell my guitar to see him play.

Finally, Patty Loveless is out
there somewhere. If you get the
chance to see her, seize it. I’ve
never been to a show, but with that
repertoire she couldn’t let you
down.

With yourentertainment taken
care of, there’s really nothing left
for me to offer but a few, brief
words of advice from some of the
wisest lines in Country music:

“So, tell that someone that you
love / Just what you’ re thinking of
/ If tomorrow never.comes”—
Garth Brooks

“Now there’s always a side-
kick in every B-western / Who’s
always in love with the lady who
leaves / But she can’t stand the
memory so! really don’t blame her
/ For taking the very first Grey-
hound she’d seen”—Radney Fos

Friends of the Arts

Fine arts enthusiast Adelaide

McKelway makes Friends of

the Arts a success.

By Josh Larned

In the 1986-87 academic
year, Adelaide McKelway spent
the year at Princeton University,
as her husband, Dr. Alexander
McKelway, conducted research
on his sabbatical. During her
brief stay, Mrs. McKelway, a
long-time fine arts enthusiast and
careerist (she undertook post-
graduate work at the Academy of
Music and Performing Arts in
Vienna), became exposed to
“Friends of Music,” a financial
support group for bringing in and
maintaining a superb musical arts
program at the university. Upon
her return to Davidson and, after
subsequent conversations with
colleagues about her exposure to
“Friends of Music,” McKelway
became persuaded to start a
similar organization at the
college.

McKelway thus tirelessly set
out upon achieving this lofty
goal by conducting’ feasibility
studies, creating a budget
proposal, examining similar
organizations from other colleges
and universities, and drumming
up area support. The result of
her extensive energies has been
the creation of Friends of the
Arts at Davidson.

Since its inception in the fall
of 1989, Friends of The Arts at

Davidson has become a essential
part of maintaining a strong fine
arts program at the college.
Unlike similar organizations of
this nature, Friends is unique in
its multi-faceted purpose to
“promote and further the
interests in music, theater, and
the visual arts.” As a result,
Friends is responsible for
assisting in the funding of
departmental and college fine
arts ventures that would have
been impossible to.pursue
otherwise.

Indeed, the organization has
been highly successful in
fulfilling its purpose, as evident
in the tremendous names it
brought to Davidson this
academic year. Composer
Milton Babbitt; pianist Dubravka
Tomsic, and abstract painter
Kenneth Noland all came to
Davidson as a result of the
efforts of Friends. Friends also

'. has the capacity to bring‘artists-
' in-residence’in theater, music,

and the visual arts to Davidson
for periods of time.

However, the merits of this
organization have quickly spread
beyond the boundaries of the
campus, as Friends seeks to
foster greater fine arts apprecia-
tion and support in the surround-
ing community. Outreach events

at the Pines, an annual Home and
Garden Tour, and bringing
school children to campus for
open rehearsals are all part of
Friends’ agenda of arts educa-
tion. With an advisory board of
twenty-one members, servings»
structural base, and’a steadily
expanding group of members in
North Mecklenburg and South
Iredell counties, and from
Davidson alumni, Friends has
successfully gathered together
what McKelway describes as
“people who care about arts.”

In a recent interview
McKelway described that one of

her current chief concerns with
regard to Friends “is somehow to
increase student membership.”
Collegiate participation aside, it
seems as if she is very pleased
with the organization’s progress

* as a fulfillment of her dream. ‘It: ;

has been really wonderful to

have the chance to do this,”
remarked McKelway. “It’s great-’
when you can take an idea and

let it come true.” Undoubtedly,
McKelway’s dream has had a
profound effect upon the entire
Davidson community.

One Acts amuse, astound

By Jacob Abraham

The 1994 Studio Theatre Pro-
ductions have certainly not had a
problem drawing crowds. On the
first night of Chamber Music and
Zoo Story, playgoers packed not
only the seats but the steps and
aisles of the Black Box Theatre,
and several students were turned
away when noteven standing room
remained. The Studio Theatre
Season consists of a wide variety
of one act-plays written by influ-
ential and significant modern play-
wrights. Aside from faculty super-
vision, the performances are en-
tirely the work of students. The
one-act format lends itself to ex-
perimental and unconventional
subject matter which can be some-
what inaccessible to the audience.
Nevertheless, the plays of the last
two weeks have succeeded in show-
casing some remarkable student
talent.

Like some of Arthur Kopit’s
other plays, the aim of Chamber
Music is to make the audience re-
act emotionally to a illogical series
of events. Set in a psychiatric
ward, the play focuses on a self-
proclaimed committee of eight fe-
male patients who are convinced
that the men’s ward of the hospital

Shayna Chazin played Queen Isabella in Chamber Music.

is planning to attack them. Through
a bizarre twist of logic, the women
concoct a scheme to scare away
the men; they will kill one of their
own to show the men what they are
capable of. Interestingly, the
woman picked to die seems to be
the most rational of the crazed
women. Perhaps Kopit is trying to
make some point about female re-
lationships, or the Feminist move-
ment, or women’s attitude towards
men and the outside world. If the
play has a point atall, itis obscured

by the Absurdist conventions em-
ployed by Kopit in this and some
of his other plays. Fortunately, the
subtle humor contained in the irra-
tional dialogue of the characters
manages to carry the play and
makes the murder scene all the
more striking and terrifying. The
characters are pure neurotics who
are difficult (if not impossible) to
analyze or identify with. With so
little to hold on to in terms of

characterization, some of the ac- -

tresses fall short and come across

viewers

as simply annoying on stage. Oth-
ers, particularly Laura J. Seib, Jen-
nifer Don, Katherine Harrison, and
Allison Wright, manage to make

. their characters distinct and even

likable in spite of (or perhaps as a’
result of) their insanity.

Edward Albee’s brilliant The
Zoo Story features two of the most
striking stage performances of the
year from Robert Ramsay and
Frank Jernigan. Part of the play’s
ingenuity lies in the simplicity of
the situation. Peter, a mousy little
book publisher with a regular fam-
ily and a regular lifestyle, is read-
ing a book on a bench in Central
Park athis regular time in the week,
when a thoroughly irregular pass-
erby strikes up aconversation with
him. The passerby who practically
forces Peter to talk with him is-
Jerry, a very lonely man whose
insanity is balanced only by his
acute awareness and sensitivity.
Jerry’s dialogue reveals his under-
standably disturbed lifestyle and
his unique way of looking at things.
He needs more than anything to
connect somehow with something,
whether it’s a person or an animal
or just an object, whether it’s
