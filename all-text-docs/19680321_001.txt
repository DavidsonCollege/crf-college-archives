Three Southern authar-eritica presented papers
and examined contemporary Southern Iiterature during
the Reynolds Symposium Motdsy and Tuesday.

Walter Sulilvan, professor of English at Vanderbilt
and author of several novels on Southern life, began
the discussion with hts observations on the need of the
Southern writer to remain in the South and confine
himeelf to Southern subjects.

written by Southern writers when they were not living

Holman examined Southern social issues in a

are basic factors which characteraze Southern writing

Duke Dean Mentioned
As Possible President

Dr, James L. Price, dean of Trinity Callege of
Duke University, is one of “S5 or 40) educators"
being considered for the Davidson presidency,
the Duke Chronicle said last week.

Price is known in most Davidson students
as the author of “Interpreting the New Testa-
ment,” the text for Bible 12,

The Chronicle attributed its report
“saurces at Davidson,” but did nol elaborate.

Described as a

“good

New ‘Testament

scholar’ by Dr. Daniel Rhodes, professoc of Bible
and religion here, Price received an MTh from
Princeton Theological Seminary and PhD from

Cambridge.

Price, who is on sabbatical this year, has been
dean of Trinity College since 1964.

He satisfies the trustees’ requirement that
the president be a Presbytertan.
