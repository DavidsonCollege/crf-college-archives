Washington and Lee meets Davidson

less will be one of the best of the season.

show what she has, but Saturday’s game

As this is the first game of the season
for us it will doubtless be well attended.

Y. M. C. A. NOTES.

The Y. M. C. A. at Davidson has
heen both appreciated and enjoyed by
the entire battalion of the S. A. ‘T. C.
unit here. ‘he pleasure in the past has
heen small compared to the enjoyment
expected.

The reading reom has been very popu-
lar. ‘The victrola, magazines and games
have attracted many, altho. the room is
very small. Mr, Moore hopes to open
the large room (on the left as you enter
the gymnasium) in a few days, as a ree-
reation room. He has appealed to the
student soldiers for rocking chairs and
Mortis chairs. “Whe arrangement. of the
quarters in the barracks are so crowded
that the space sci arcely permits a rocker,
and. by giving it to the Y. M. C. A.
which vou would have been compelled to
throw away, you benefit yourself as well
as your comrades, for there in the recre-
ation room you too may enjoy it.

With great pleasure to the ‘soldiers
Mr. Moore has announctd that — the
“wnovie” machine has been shipped from
Atlanta and the arrival is expected in a
few days. He also states that pictures
will be shown every Tuesday and Sat-
urday which will appeal to the fellows.

The Y. M. C. A. has made prepara-
tions for the strengthening of the soul as
well as for the diversion of the mind and
body. On each hall a man has been ap-
pointed to lead his comrades in the study
of the Bible as it influences the conduct
and character of the true soldier. “The
Soldiers’ Spirit” is the topic of the study.
These meetings are held every Sunday
morning at 10 o'clock, Everyone should
make it his duty to attend these mect-
ings,

“THE SOLDIER'S SPIRIT”
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION

The Bible classes started off last Sun-
day at 10 a. m. with great interest and
enthusiasm. About 180 men were pres-
ent. That is a very good beginning, but
every man should be in one of — these
classes. .

DR. SHEARER CONVALESCING
AFTER LONG ILLNESS

All old) Davidson ‘mene will be very
glad to hear that Dr. Shearer, the be-
loved Bible Professor and) ex-president
of Davidson College, is now convalescing
after a long and serious illness.

Dr. Shearer paid his: usual visit: to

Virginia last summer in spite of the fact}.

that he had been in especially weak con-
dition. Early this fall he was seized
with what apparently was a omalarial
fever of a stubborn and baffling char-
acter. At the same time he has had
renewed trouble with his eyesight, which
has been very weak for several years
past.

On account of his extreme weakness
it was feared by his physicians that he
might -be attacked by Spanish influenza.
In his condition such an attack would
probably have proved fatal. and conse-
quently he has been placed under the
strictest quarantine.

He is now very much better and has
been sitting up a while each day for the
past week. It is hoped that he will soon
be strong enough for the quarantine to
be lifted so that his friends may see him
often,

Dr. Shearer has always been a true
friend to the men of Davidson College.
and it is safe to sav that as soon as he is
able he will be glad to talk with and ad-
vise anyone wishing to see him, whether
a new or an old man at Davidson.

Lorraine Dotson is getting on nicely

at the Infirmary.

He has been ill with
pneumonia, ‘
