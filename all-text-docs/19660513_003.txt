Revolutions Will Play
Great Role In Future

How wall the Onited States
faces tha inevitable outbreak
of future revolutions will groat-
dy affect the prospects of man,
according to newspaperman Wil-
liam Worthy. who visited Dav-
Sttson recontly.

Current United Siates policy
came dander attack from Worthy
for failure to meet adequately
the situations created by these
ortieeaks, We are Loo prone to
hlame everything on the Com-
tmunists, tao tnuch concerned for
our own welfare rather than the
woll-being of the other country
involved, and too willing to play
policeman of the world, he as-
sarted.

Worthy, a 1956-67 Nieman fel
low to journalism at Harvard,
spoke as a world traveler and
correspondent for the Baltimore
Alro-American.

Agreeing with Senator WIl-
Ham Fulloright. Worthy stated
that jt is mislesding to view
all revolutions as being elther
antl. or pro Communist. We
‘must look further and try
to understand cach revolution
io the contoxt of national prob-
lems and aspirations.

Worthy attacked American
support of corrupt governments
in areas of political instability.
He c¢laimed that such support
Stems {rom myopie attempts to
gain economic benefit for
American interests.

Comparing President Tyndon
Johnson tu Sheriff Jim Clart of
Solinn, Warthy accused the Unit-
ed Stntey of unjust Intervention
in Viet Nam. The Viet Cong
are not o front for Chinese ag-
gresston, said Worthy. and the
United States attempts to act
stop an anti-colonial revolution
with terrorist tactics.

In line with his opposition to
United States attemps to act
as “policoman of the world,” he

Dr. Harmon R. Holcomb. pro.
fessor of philosophy of religion
at Coigate- Rochester Seminary,
developed the theme of “Pros-
pects of Man" with reference
to man's theological orientation
tn a fast-changing world.

In a recent chapel speech, Hol-
comb concentrated mainly on
the much publicized Denth of
God Movement, with which he
ls in fundamental opposition.
He tas debated against n kay
figure in this movement, Paul
Van Buren, Professor of Now
Testament at Temple Univer-
sity.

SERIOUS THEOLOGY

Despite his opposition to tho
Death of God theologians, Hol-
comb asserted that it is of the
utmost Importance that thelr
movement be Laken seriously,
because it marks one of the few
serious controversies in the mod:
orm Christian Church.

The iden behind the move-
ment is not a new one, he added.
Secularista have been saying
that God 4s dead for 400 yoars,
The significance of Lhe move-
ment lies i the fact that it
has its origins within the church,
not outside it.

Worthy did not entirely oppose
American intervention in other
parte of the world. He ealled
for truly altrulstie aid to uh
derdeveloped areas and said that
It 18 not the duty of the United
States to term any revolution
illegitimate.

Worthy, himself a Negro, ex-
plained the relation of the civil
rights movement tn the United
States ta ovents obrond. He
pointed aut that becauag of this
low ecanomic status a high per:
centade of Nogrocs aro being

This, plus the fact Urat the
war in Viet Nam Is taking on the
overtones of the white versus
the colored, {s leading to wide-
spread oppoaltion to the war by
American Negroes. He describ-
ed the general attitude, “The
Viet Cong never called me a
nigger.”

The newspaperman further
claimed that public support for
the Viet Nam war is eroding “as
things go Irom bad to worse.”
He pointed out that the war is
beginning to reach into every
part of the United States as
casualties increase,

ers might be able to agree on

The attempts of the Death of

If Jesus Js not in some way

Man Free As God Dies,

Jewish Rabbi Asserts

Rabbi Richard Rubanatain at-
tneked the question of man's
immediate future from nf pro-
Death of God position in a series
of lectures on campus in Jate
March.

The Jewish chaplain from the
University of Pittsburgh conclud-
ed that man |3 not subject to
the will of a god, and is con-
sequently free to act aa he
withes aa jong as he iy respon-
sible for his actions.

Thus the Denth of Gai tho-
ology, according to Rubenstein,
is extremely appropriate and
pertinent to man living under
this exislontiallat ethic.

CONCEPT OF GOD

In defense of his position, he
traced the development of the
concapt of god, explaining that
men first Mved a consmunal
existence in which a tyrannical
father dominated the younger
men and “owned” all the wom:
en,

Tho jealous young men event-
ually killed the tyrant and ate
‘his body because of the reyer-
ence they held for him, but be-
Ing so conditloned lo fear of
the omnipotent father and still
mysteriously feeling bis pres:
ence, they were afraid lo enjoy
the wornen.

Rubenstein malntalned that
the Imoxe of god mew out of
thin attlhitnde that men held to-
ward their dead but somehow
atf present fathers: God be-
came an all-powerful being who
ds murdered by men and who
nevorthelesk §=prevents mans
pleasure in Ife,

‘DEATH-MYTH’

Rubenstein palnted {to the
Death of God movement as an
extension of what he called the
“dentb-myth,” notlng that tie
crucifixion af Christ is still ann-
other version of the “death:
myth.”

Ramifieations of the apparent
validity of the Death of God
theology, according to Ruben-
yr Stein, include a need to change
the popular concept of religion.

It must be disconnected from
God, he said, and become ‘the
way men share tho suffering
and the great oceaslans of their
lives,”

RITUAL

Consequentiy, ritualistic rea
ligions like Judaism and Cathol.
icilsm, since they offer greater
emotional enrichment. become
more significant than more for
mal, Jess emotional religions
like Protestanism.

Rubenstoon added, hawever;

that even will lind more mean-
ing im the religions in which
they nore raised, regardless of
tine denontingtion, than they will
tind wisewhere,

indicted Protestants,
elalining that they cannot ercape
from thelr teadition, yet their
tradition offers littie opportunity
for emotional fulffilment.

Sexunl accomplishment or
economic achiovement are the
otily means for developmen of
the étmotional life for Protest-
anla, Rubenstein conclided,

Machines Replace Men

Because of rlaing atitomation
ulthmately producing lewer jobs,
there must be elther basle eco-
nomic structutal changes or the
inatitution of a guaranteed in-
come for all, according to noted
economist Robert Theobald who
spoke here last October.

Theobald contends that man
fg living in a world of economic
transition. The mafor principles
dominating this transition will
be that machines rather than
men will take up work openings
and that the activity of mon
will be devoted to new forms
of work and lelsure,

Noting that the rate of de
mand is Inerensing faster than
the rate of supply ever has,
Theobald snys that new moth.

ods of automation are being ere
ated to meet greater demands.

Automation can handle many
jobs better than men. Theobald
maintains. “We are now enter-
ing an age when machines can
toll for us, and it is therefore
surely grotesque that we con-
tinue to insist on competing
with them for the ever-shrinking
amounts of toll that are avall-
able,

“We cannot free man from
toll unless we achieve funda-
mental changes in our technique’
of distributing resources andl
olsa .. . in Western man‘s view
of what gives vatue to his life.”

The guaranteed income. or as
Theobald ans tt “Basic Eco-
nomic Securtty.”' now enters

his thesis..

Theobald puts forth tentative
figures such as $1,000 for every
adult and $600 for every child:
Jn the family. To institute such
a program in the United States
would cost From $12 40 $20 bil-
Hon dollars.

This amount of money would
not be hard to obtain, he con-
tinues. Anyway, the money
would be put directly back into

the economy.

This theory “advances the
Idea that every individual is
worthy of certain fundament-
al rights, including an income
sufficient to live on with dig-
nity.” Jt would alsa lead to
needed IUmitationg on waste.
