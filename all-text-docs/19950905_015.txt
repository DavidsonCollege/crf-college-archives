The paper reported in some

editions Monday that the long-time
49ers coach had been hired.

In fact, Kohlenstein has been
helping the team in an unofficial
capacity, but he is not on salary.

Kohlenstein has recently been
coaching the Raleigh Flyers in the

Cross Country

sprints

into

new season

By WILL BRADSHAW
Staff writer

Youth is acommon theme this
year, as both men’s and women’s
cross country are dominated by
younger runners. Despite that rela-
tive lack of experience, however,
both teams hope to improve on last
year’s conference finishes. .

CROSS COUNTRY

The women’s team, which
consists of 12 runners (eight fresh-
men, one sophomore, and three
seniors) is led by senior co-cap-
tains Phuong Nguyen and Marie
Grisez, but the anticipated No. 1
runner is a freshman, Suzy Burr.

“I don’t really feel a lot of
pressure,” Burr said, “The times
are a lot closer together in college
than they were on my high school
team, and there’s a bunch of people
at the top. We can all work to-
gether as a team.”

The top four runners from last
year’s team, which finished fifth in
the conference, are gone, and coach
Beth Puckett said that this season
will hinge on the development of
the freshmen runners.

“We have gotten a little bit
better each of the last three or four
years, but this season our team is
very young,” she said.

“We are trying to work the
team concept very hard because
with so many freshmen we really
need to be a team in order to per-
form well.” :

While the men’s team does
not have quite the same prepon-
derance of freshmen as the women,
seven of their nine runners are
freshmen or sophomores.

“This is a very young team,”

said men’s coach Gary Andrew.
“We have one senior (Eric
Collings), but he has never run
cross country before.”

Andrew was very impressed
with the condition in which his
runners arrived at school, saying
that it has been about five years
since a group has trained as much
over the summer.

Like their female counterparts,
the men have their own impressive
recruitin Keith Gordon. And when
Gordon is added to the returning
core of sophomore Josh Cookson
and last year’s No. 1 runner and
team captain, Dave Foss, a junior,
and sophomore Tripp Franklin,
Andrew has a strong group of four
runners. He said that finding acon-
sistent fifth man to add to the bunch
would allow this team to do better
than they have in previous years.

“It’s very exciting being a
freshman on a Division 1 team,”
Gordon said. “I do feel a little bit
of pressure, but I keep it in the back
of my mind to do my best. Every-
body has bad days, and if I have a
bad race or bad practice, I just have
to forget about it and move on.”

The women’s race is 5,000
meters long, vbich translates to
three and 1/8 miles, and the men’s
race is five miles long. :

To get a team score for both
men and women, the top five fin-
ishers on each team have their
places added together, and the low-
est total score wins.

Both the men’s and women’s
teams had their first meet this past
weekend (September 2) at Appala-
chian State.

Other schools that competed
in the meet (besides Davidson and
Appalachian State) were Wake
Forest, UNC-Asheville and
UNCC. The Wildcats host the
Davidson Open/Alumni Invita-
tional this weekend.

One secret that I have picked
up on, however, is to fish the areas
that appear to lack good fishing
structure, yet are near cover. Ihave
found that some of the largest fish
in the lake sit in extremely thick
cover during the day, and at feed-
ing times, they prowl the deepwater
areas nearby for helpless baitfish,
snakes, lizards and even small

ducks. While fishing in these areas
can be tedious, once the big fish
hits, it will be worth it. =
Fishing this time of year might
require strange hours, but imagine
walking into your 8:30 class hav-
ing already caught a five-pound
largemouth. Believe me, there is
no better way to start off a day.
See ya on the water! -
