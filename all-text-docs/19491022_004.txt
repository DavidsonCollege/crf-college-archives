“B IK O”

By KURT BIEDENKOFF

By telling you what was done in|

our high school, in order to help
the German®™™ _
youth to under.
the. new
democratic idéas,
T am trying to
show you what
sooner or lfater
happened in

most of our a 7
“i

high schools
Germany.

As I said before, we were try-
ing to play some kind of a political
game. But what was the idea? We
planned to form a miniature state
in our school, to consider our school
a people that was now forming a
government. All institutions you
find in a good-working government
would be copied. We would have a
parliament, an executive body and
a judicial body. All rules would
be written down in a constitution.
We would have proponent and op-
ponent groups, the opposition would
be very strong—we knew this even
before we started.

So we started in February, 1959,
drawing up 4 plan for our consti-
tution as it might be made. Speak-
ing of us, I mean the boys and
myself. We suggested a govern-
ment consisting of a legislature, an
executive corps, and a judicial
body. Our principal would be the
president, assisted by a student as
vice president. The executive
would be made up of students and
teachers, and so would the judicial.

We finished ovr work two
months later, and then, formed a
provisional parliament to which we
presented our plan. But we did not
find much assent. Everybody was
skeptical. When the meeting. was
over, we had succeeded in forming
a committee, which was told by
the meeting to discuss. the plan.
Endless discussions followed, and
everybody grew tired of it. The
opposition and the great lack of in-
terest seemed to be too strong.

So we decided to found a news-
paper, and try to create interest in
the thing, negative or positive in-
terest, for it is. easier to fight an
opposition interested in a thing
than to convince people of some-
thing they do not care for. >

At that time a license was re.
quired for any kind of publication,

and ‘we had to get 2 license at
Military Government. This was the
first time 1 ever came in touch
with the M. G. officials, and I have
never again found such wonderful
cooperation, We did not only get
our license, but M. G. (OMGUS
—Office of Military Government
\ of the U. S.) arranged meetings of
school newspaper staffs

all

throughout the country. It invited
prominent speakers to speak to us;
it cheered us up when things were

bad, and gave us good advice when
we were in trouble. And we were
in trouble very often. First of all
we could not get enough paper to
print a good newspaper; so
OMGUS gave us the paper. We
often had difficulties with the Ger-
man officials, and OMGUS was
always able to settle the dispute.
T can only repeat that we had won-
derful cooperation.

But now back to our school.
The paper was published, and it
helped us a lot, The good thing. was
that those who planned the consti-
tution had the paper to support it.
So in July, we ,presented the con.
stitution, which had been changed
in its, texts many times, but whose
content was still the same, to the
student body and the faculty for
acceptance. We knew within our
school it would be a magnificerit
change, if it would be accepted,
Everybody knew it, but still many
did not like it. Fourteen days be-
fore the day the voting should take
place, I started the campaign with
a speech in a meeting of the pro-
visional government (all ‘students
from the fifth to ninth grades,
and the faculty). And the pian
worked perfectly. It really was a
wonderful campaign. We had a

strong opposition, a hard time, but.

a lot of fun, and it was a wonder-
ful experience for all of us. Evéry-
body knew what was going on, and
the boys began to understand that
each of them was important, that
the individual was important. We
had many meetings, and propa-
ganda was made, pro and con.

Then the election came, and the
constitution was accepted in a
secret ballot election.

And from this day on, our con-
stitution was our school law.

CAMPUS CLUB

On Thursday, October the thir-
teenth, the Campus Club held its
usual weekly meeting. The regular
business matters were taken up and
the meeting would have been dis-
tinguished by nothing were it not
for one significant fact. The date
of this meeting coincided with the
second anniversary of the Campus
Club as an active organization on

the Davidson scene. |

Prior t6 the business meeting a

THE DAVIDSONIAN

speech was made by the president,
Malloy Owen. It is the accepted
thing whenever a speech is made
by some officer of an ofganization
to indicate approval by a round
6f applause. But when Malloy had
finished, not a sound was to be
heard. And this was not meant as
‘any discourtesy to the president.
The silence stemmed, instead, from
what he said. For the speech of-
fered much more than the usual
remarks appropriate on such occa.
sions — it more a_ challenge
than a self-congratulation. It told,
of course, something of the his-
tory of the club and of its present
ever-growing significance here on
the Campus. But its unique quality
lay in the stress placed on the
necessity for continued and aug-
mented effort by each member of
the club toward making the club's
ideals a reality.

This was the reason, then, for
the silence. For thongh it was an
inspiring speech, it was also the
the kind of speech which quickens
the sense of responsibility and
makes each member realize that,
ultimately, the success or failure of
the Campus Club is going to rest
squarely on his shoulders.

This, the first report from the
Campus Club, is submitted in this
spirit, We wish to make public
the idea which was so perfectly
expressed by our president and
pledge ourselves to the extension
of the good things of the frater-
nity system—brotherhood, loyalty
and the chance to be an active part
of campus life — to every inde-
pendent on the campus of David-
son College.

SIGMA CHI

“IT might say in opening this essay
That I for my words may have
to pay.
' But just remember that revenge
is sweet,
And that we again in this article
shall meet.” (RLM)

With no further ado let us pro-
ceed into the Sig activities. The
news of the week is the valiant
Sig fooball team, which in the past
week racked up at total of 42 points
to 0. With Johnny Kelton leading
the way offensively and G. J. Gris-
som defensively, the Sigs went wild
on the gridiron.

Some of the Sigs are taking life
seriously by enrolling in that mar.
riage course. Brothers Hampton,
Morgan, Jackson, Beatie, Apperson
and Clark are working overtime
on term projects and tedious Lab
work, Meanwhile “Gold Dust”
Hamilton has deserted, the confines
of D. C. for Concord with all its
honey, clover, and tiddliwinks! Who
shot Who?

Mischievous Murray has re-
treated to-seclusion this week-end
to devote the remainder of his ca-
reer to celibacy and to recover
from his humiliating experience in
‘Atlanta. From all reports Jim has
done extensive research on the
theme, “What do other men have
which I don't.’'

Sigma Chi is proud of its two
movie actors. Phil “Keenan Wynn”
Davis, and Vance “Lou Costello”
Mizelle who are the images ‘of
their superiors, both in looks and
actions.

while Lemon Harris continues to

half-way actions. “Dat’s a Good
Idea” Eastman, Mighty Rat Birk-
head and Cavity Doxey continue
their incessant battle against star-
vation, while the cultured Coffee
Club satisfies their cravings at
Hugh’s. We close by giving a
wreath of roses to Jimmy Jones,
who was initiated last week, and

saders.

KAPPA ALPHA

In the beginning man was cre.
ated and he had dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the
birds of the heavens, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the
earth. Now man was lonesome in
the world so the great Creator cre-
ated woman. At first woman was
primarily a side issue and remain-
ed so untj! some idiot, feeling sorry
for her, decided to give the female
population suffrage. Soon after wo-

man had been .jegally established
as man’s equal, she slowly began
to usurp man’s power by henpeck-
ing. browbeating, and finally cap-
tivating him with her irresistible
beauty and affection until man no
longer’ occupied his centuries old
position of importance in the world
except in the art of making love.
The net result of this usurpation of
power by woman is that man want-
ed to become toncly once more
and he cursed the day that woman
was conceived. However, man has
not completely cast woman from
his life — as it often appears at
Davidson — but finds her particu-
larly enticing on various occasions,
i.e., parties, dates, dances, and week
ends in general.

This week end is one of the oc.
casions when man withdraws from
his shell of loneliness and seclu-
sion — as woman will witness —
because he has very easily fallen
prey to the designs of the Pan-
Hellenic Council. The festivities
of the week end definitely call for
companionship and support from
the “weaker sex.” Dances — “neck-
ing set to music,” parties and the
like are undoubtedly better when
woman is present.

The Knights of Sigma Chapter
want to cordially welcome the ad-
dition of feminine charm and beau-
ty to its shell of loneliness — the
Davidson campus — and to their
newly redecorated Chapter ‘house
this Homecoming week end. We
know that you will have a good
time and hope that you will soon

We are happy down at the old
SAE house that Bro. Sandy Car-
negie is now a proud papa of a 7 Ib.
and 9 oz. bouncing baby daughter,
Helen Sandra. Sandy is doing

well so we are told; congratula- |:

elected President of the Scabbard
and Blade Military Fraternity.
Speaking of the Honorary Frater-
nities we are proud that Bro. Billy
Pate has been asked to join the
Alpha Epsiion Delta which is the
Pre-Medical group here on the
campus.

Bro. Bob Millar's purple and yel-
low football team has now won
three out of four; we turned down
the SPE’s, the Phi Delts, and the

Campus Club and lost only to the|<

KA’s by a small margin. No little
of our success has been due to some
fine defensive play on the part of

The Greeks | Court House Humor

By FRED SCHWAEMMLE, Jr.

it you have ever traveled
through some’parts of Georgia, you
will .undoubtedly recall that the
highways which are little better
than cow paths generally go right
through the middle of the numer-
ous little towns dotting the coun-
tryside. Placed squarely in the cen-
ter of the town and the highway is
usually a ramshackle brick court
house which has probably been
standing there since before the
days of Sherman.

The court house generally stgni-
fies that this little country town,
no matter how small, is the county
seat. Seated on the benches placed
in front of the court house can
usually be seen a motley group of
men. Their faces have been well
wrinkled by the sands of time,
while their clothes are shabby, not
from washing but wear. Clad in
multi-patched and faded overalls,
run down shoes, if any, and a moth
eaten felt hat they sit there a-spit-
tin’ and achewin’ and a-lookin’ at
their big city shoe wearing neigh-
bors who are only passing through.
This seems to be their main goal
in life. Occasionally they bestir

ithemselves to eat and to listen to

the unfrequent proceedings which
occur in the court house they are
‘leaning against.

On one of these benches in front
of a county court house our story
takes place. Wiping the tobacco
juice from his lip and whiskers, an
old gentleman turns to the fellow
next to him and says, “Say doc,
how come. you, a man in a respec.
tible profession like your’in dip and
chew snuff? Huh!” |

The retired country doctor low-
ers the pipe from his mouth and
answers the old gentleman. “Well
friend, I tell yoo. Pd been a doc

fer about a yeer in dis hare town]

and nobody had called on me.
These folks jest didn’t trust no
newcomer like I twas. Well, as 1
twas a seying, 1 twas sittin’ in my
office one day a thinkin’ what I
twas a-gonna do when a old nigger
boy come to de door. He twas real.
ly a-huffin and a-puffin. He telled
me to hurry cause his mammie twas
a-fixin’ to have a baby. I catched
hold of my littie black bag and
scurried along with dis hare boy
and before long we had shore

nuff came to his mammie’s shack.
Old Grandma meet us at de door
and chased some of de hound dogs
off de porch so as I could get thru.

“Well, as I twas seying, grand-
ma took me into de tother room
whar her daughter lay a-moanin’.
l fetched my baby deliverin’ stuff
from my black bag and got ready
to deliver dis har baby. I'd ‘jest
about git ready when grandma
turns to me and asked if it twas
time to snuff her, Well, I looks ra-
ther confused der a moment cause
1 tain’t n’er heard of snuffin’ fore.
I thinks thet 1 had to sey some-
thing so I just said, ‘No grandma,
it tain’t time to snuff her yet.’ I
carried myself into de tother room
to think fer a moment about what
grandma said.

“Well, as 1 twas seying, I jest
set thar and thunk to myself fer
a while. After a few cottin pickin’
minutes old grandma came in an
asked agin if it twas time to snuff
her yet. I sez, ‘No grandma, tain’t
time to snuff her yet.’ Grandma
jest looks at me kinda peeculiar
like and walked back into de toth-
er room.

“Since [ ain't n’er hared of snul-
fin an expectant mother I runs back
to my office and begins to look
thru some of dem big thick doc-
ter’s books of mine. Well, friend,
I looks and I looks but I n’er finds
nothin’ about snuffin’.

“Well, as I twas seying, | hurry
myself back’ to de shanty and gits
thar jest in time to meet old grand-
ma a.comin’ from de tother room.
She sez, ‘Doc 1 thinks it’s about
time to snuff her’. I didn’t know
rightly what to sey so I sez. to
old grandma, ‘Yes, guess it tis
grandné.’

“Well, as 1 was seying, | didn't
know exactly what to do, so 1 jest
followed old grandma into de toth-
er room whar de mammie jest lay
a-groanin’ with pain. Grandma
retched down into her bossom and
pulled out a little box. She poured
a little snuff into de lid and then
she leaned over de mammie. She
blowed de snuff right into de
mammtie’s face and de mammie
snezzed and out come a little pick-

anniny. Well, I’ve been a snuffin”

dem ever since!”

ers” Bennett look like pros at the

finally found one thing Bill Bled-
soe could do that he said he could
—kick off. Bro. John Hutchins al.
so proved ifivaluable as 4 line back-
er in the C. C. game.

We noted some fine playing of
the pledges on the freshman foot-
ball team against Furman. Kent
Glover got a little rough with the
opposition there toward the last
but Dick “Long John” Kelley has
more compassion on thom. We were
sorry to see A. C. Gregg get a
little shaken up on a block that
he layed, but the other fellow felt
it too, he said. Max Morrison play-
ed a hard game also; he was heard
to.say that Furman had the best
$30,000 dollar team he'd ever seen,
at least they got a lot of beef in
on the deal.

Bros. Shaw and McAlister went
to Converse this week end to date
their sisters — wasn't that sweet,
though. Bro. Everett Blake's ‘eyes

seem to cloud up a bit every time
