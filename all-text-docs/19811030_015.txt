smal: reviews with Jon Glance

Was (Not Was)
The Police

In the beginning there.was James
White and the Contortions, and Funk
Punk (a.k.a: No Wave; from the “No
New. York” LP) was a mixture of
equal parts James Brown groove,
Johnny Rotten nihilistic snarl, Cap-
tain Beefheart. dissonance, and
Ornette Coleman free-blowing.
Then. David Byrne went back to
Africa, and “Remain in Light” re-
_. placed the snarl with a cosmic dia-
tribe over complex polyrhythmic
percussion. Now, with “Was (Not
Was)”, two weird white guys from
Detroit have put more Funk in the
genre than Punk, but the result is still
bizarre enough to warrant interest.

“Was (Not Was)” is made up of
Don Was and David Was (not their
real names) and numerous session
musicians, including the former
Brides of Funkenstein, .ex-MC-5
guitarist Wayne Kramer, and ex-
trumput -player. for Ray..Charles,
Marcus Belgrave. This blend of

soulful funk, psychedelic rock, and
free-jazz dissonance is much more
y than one might think;
however, the lyrics are the most in-
teresting ‘thing about this album. In
- “Oh, Mr. Friction!” the chorus is

“Drink from the bottle when I home
alone...» .-

Spank the kids with a fork

Run the: appliances high speed all
day

Switch station every five seconds.”

The song relates a dramatic mono-
logue of a mental breakdown in Sub-
urbia, with the emotionless back-
‘ground vocals and lazy horns provid-
- ing pointed contrast to the psychotic
lead vocals.
Perhaps the best cut on the album
._ 1s “Tell Me That I’m Dreaming,” in
_ which an.astonished brother relates a
capitalist nightmare (“One man liked
_ . milk/ Now he owns amillion cows”)
_ Of some not-too-distant future. Over
the funk vamp, however, is a tape of

Ronald Reagan repeating “Out of

control” over and over. Weird. One -

song that is climbing up the disco
charts is the accidentally-commer-
cial “Out Come the Freaks,” a diago-
nal saga of the aftermath of. a Nuclear
holocaust..

While “Was (Not Was)” may be
too funky for some New Wavers, .

~ fans of Frank Zappa, Parliament /
‘Funkadelic, and the Talking Heads

will probably like this album. ‘Well

, Dick, I'll give this album a 94; the
. lyrics are strange, but it’s got a good

beat and you can dance to it.

Ghost in the Machine
(Personnel: Sting, bass and vo-

cals; Andy Summer, guitar; Stewart —

Copeland, drums and percussion)

With the release of their fourth
album, “Ghost in the Machine,” the
Police achiece a quantum leap in re-
spectability in New Wave circles.
Critics who bemoaned the vacuous
pop tones on “Zenyatta Mondatta”
will be relieved by the eleven com-
plex, intelligent songs on this LP, ar-
guably their best effort. “Ghost in
the. Machine” shows marked altera-
tions in the tone, style, and produc-

’ tion from previous Police albums.

The tone is much darker than be-
fore, even.on the commercially ac-

ceptable single “Every Little Thing-

She Does is Magic.” This song, re-

‘leased before the LP, is’ more- similar

to the dreamy “Walking on the
Moon” than to the vapid “De odo do
do, de da da da,” fortunately for the
serious listener. The titles on this al-
bum (“Spirits
World,” “Invisible Sun,”. “Secret
Journey,” and “Darkness,” for ex-
ample) give some indication of this
change, as does the album art (gloss
black, with three ambiguous com-
puter digits, as opposed to the prior
use of pervasive portraits of Sting
and the rest).

The change in style perhaps

owes something to the police’s
world tour to places whiere few-or no
rock bands had ever performed be-
fore — particularly the Middle East

-and India. While many of the songs

on this album still mix New Wave
drive with slick reggae rhythms,

there are many genres not previously
heard from this band which are inter-

mingled with it. Jamaican dub, funk -
grooves, arid psychedelic phrasings

all find their way into the cuts, in‘a
thick soup of sound which is hypnot-
ically mystic at times. Horns (unfor-
tunately uncredited on the scant liner
notes) are used to great effect in most
of the songs, and the occasional ato-

nalities of the overlay of synthesiz-
ers, horns, and guitar ‘produces a

sound oddly reminiscent of “Remain

"in Light” and early Pink Floyd.

“POLICE

_. » While the production of “Ghost
in the Machine” i is as uniforntly bril-

fiant as in previous albums by the Po-

‘lice, there are ‘a number of positive
‘Changes. Sting’s ‘rock ‘steady bass
 lins: have the power of Dub, and a
sinuous energy that prods and drives

the songs. Stewart. Copeland’s
drumming is excellent as usual, but
Andy Summer’ 8 guitar shows a.dra-

Matic improvement. His solo work .
borders on the psychedelic, with'ob-

vious influences by Jimi Hendrix and

Robert Fripp. The dense, prvocative

mix which washes over you like the .
warm darkness of a sensory depriva-
tion tank provides the final link in
this truly fine album.

. In “Ghost in the Machine,” the
Police move toward the front of the

‘New Wave, with the Talking Heads

and the Clash, as innovators, not
merely popularizers, Hopefully, the
Police have gained a large enough
audience to take these innovations to
Middle America, ‘something ‘David
Byrne and Joe Strummer have not
yet succeeded in inctnad
