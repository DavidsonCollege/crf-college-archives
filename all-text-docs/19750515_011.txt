Letter to the Editor

Police photo prompts
pride, not punishment

To the Editor:

About two months ago the David-
sonian ran a cover Story on the Davidson
police force--or better. its efficiency.

Among the statistics and salutations
there stands one issue seriously misin-
terpreted by the members of the town
hall. Emblazoned on the cover, and later
characterized in the editorial section,
was the now nostalgic scene; three
police cars at Seven-Eleven.

By virtue of this photograph, the town
hall took it upon themselves to ban all
police from Seven-Eleven: their
rationale being that the photography
had caught them in the act of slacking-
off on duty.

Let me state right now, that I believe
the photograph was not intended as the
Town Hall interpreted it; in fact it
presents to the Davidson student the op-
posite perspective.

It is common knowledge that our local
Seven-Eleven is the only such store in
the area that has not been ‘“‘hit’’; and
you wonder why.

It has been my experience when en-
tering an all night stop-and-go (such as
the Seven-Eleven on NE. 21 in north
Charlotte), of whether this time I’1] be in
the midst of a robbery; but this feeling is
nonexistent in Davidson, and I wonder
why. .

The Police force has one of the most
admirable rapports with college stu-
dents I’ve ever seen; exchanges be-
tween police and students at the Seven-
Eleven are as common as_the high
prices.

The cooperation between the two is
blatantly obvious, and you wonder why.
The police have been banned from

Seven-Eleven, and it doesn’t make |

sense.

I am asking the Town Hall to reverse
their decision to ban the police from
Seven-Eleven. From the contents of the
article, it was obvious that the
photograph was to be taken as a source
of pride, not punishment.

Extra-curricular involvement yields

One of the most obvious charac-
teristics of the Davidson experience is
that it possesses two aspects: the
classroom and the _ outside-the-
classroom experience.

What the classroom experience is, is I
think quite clear to most people. Ex-
perience outside the classroom is,
however, something whose charac-
teristics are less well defined.

If it means a sort of unorganized,
mixed, and varied compound of events
which range from staring out a window
to throwing a frisbee, I think we are
missing animportant area of experience.

Surely, relaxation of this type is
something which everybody needs—but
it does not provide a balance to our
academic experience. These kinds of
activites cannot be rewarding and
satisfying enough.

One of the paradoxes of the classroom
experience is that the discipline we must
adopt actually leaves us more free

= . because it cuts away the weight of

ignorance. But this type of discipline is
certainly not limited to the classroom,
but also applies to our experience out-
side of class.

Much of what we learn about living
cannot be gotten in the classroom. I
think, then, we have come close to what

.. I might consider the essential type. of

outside-the-classroom experience in the
form of extra-curricular activities,
Extra-curricular activities in this
sense provide an organized set of ex-
periences which use the same method as
the classroom experience, but teach dif-
ferentthings which complement and sup-
plement your classroom experience.
Most importantly, however, both the

classroom and the extra-curricular
sphere provide a testing ground for the
things we learn in the one which we then
test in the other. This kind of interaction
is invaluable.

I find very interesting Larry Barr’s
comment in a recent issue of The David-
sonian in an article relating to ad-

missions that students who are involved
in every kind of extra-curricular ac-
tivity while in high school come to
Davidson and end up doing nothing but
studying. Obviously, they didn’t un-
derstand what they were doing: they
only wanted an impressive record or
were victims of peer pressure.

I see more students than ever before ,

becoming involved in extra-curricular
activites. One might suggest that two
reasons for this are an increasing
awareness on the part of both students
and faculty of the importance of these
inds of activites.

There are still, however, some students
and faculty who do not realize the value
of the extra-curricular experience, em-
phasizing the classroom time ex-
perience over the time spent outside of
class, assuming that learning can only
take place in the classroom. This is

Not only would I encourage faculty not
only to encourage their students to
achieve academically, but to take part
and achieve in the kind of extra-
curricular activities which also seek to
provide an. enjoyable education ex-
perience. If we have this kind of balance,

I think we'll be able to realize some
of the potential in the college com-
munity which is not being tapped..
