‘Cats register solid road victory over UTC

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Sports Writer

On a night when Ben Ebong was
absent from the Wildcats lineup,
Stephen Marshall most emphatically
arrived. In front of a crowd of 5,082 at
UTC Arena in Chattanooga, the 6-foot-
8 junior forward from Midlothian, Va.
turned in a 23 point, 9 rebound perfor-
mance to lead the ‘Cats to an impressive
68-54 victory over the UTC Mocs. It
was a victory which came without the
services of Ben Ebong, who is nursing
an ailing back.

Marshall, dubbed “Dancing Bear”
by Davidson Wildcat radio broadcaster
Frank Santore, finished 9-15 from the
field and 5-5 from the line. He has now
hit 14 consecutive free throws and 27 of

his last 28. “We firmly believe that
Stephen can play against anyone in the
country,” states Wildcats head coach
Bob McKillop of Marshall, Saturday’s
Fox Sports South Player of the Game.

Tied 35-35 at intermission,
McKillop’s crew wore down and all but
eliminated UTC’s offensive attack in
the second half with a variety of stifling
zone defenses. “We tried to change
looks on them, and mix it up a lot,” said
McKillop, whose ‘Cats are now 10-7
overall and 5-2 in Southern Conference
play.

With 9:00 left in regulation and
the ‘Cats up 51-48, Davidson guard
Michael Bree connected on perhaps the
most critical three point basket of his

young career, giving the ‘Cats a 6-point
edge. The bucket was Bree’s only tally
on the night.

After holding the Mocs scoreless
over the next four minutes, the ‘Cats
delivered the decisive blow with 5:25
left to go, when Ali Ton caught up with
and corralled an erratic downcourt pass,
then pivoted and drained a clutch three
pointer, giving Davidson a command-
ing 59-48 lead. UTC never recovered.

“Tt was a great, great win for us in
a tough place to play,” said McKillop,
who is now just two victories shy of 150
for his Davidson career.. “Our bench
came alive, our veterans came up big,
and we flowed well. That’s as good as
we've been offensively all year. We

were simply phenomenal in transition.”
The ‘Cats shot 47% from the field and
an impressive 71% from the line, while
UTC was held to just 38% from the field
on the night.

What, then, can possibly explain
Stephen “Dancing Bear” Marshall’s
offensive outburst on Saturday night?
Coach McKillop has a suggestion.
“Landry (Kosmalski) gave Stephen a
real tough time in practice on Tuesday.
Right from the start Landry told him, ‘If
you want to establish position in the
post, you’re gonna have to fight me for
it.’ He really lit a fire under Stephen.”

Kosmalski may, then, be the team’s
finest motivator. If he so, it must be
noted that he ain’t too shabby a per-

former, either. The 6’7’’, 215-lb. power
forward from Bedford, Texas contrib-
uted 13 points and 7 rebounds to the
Wildcats’ cause on Saturday night. ~

Freshman Brian Turner continued
his torrid three point shooting for the
‘Cats, finishing with 6 points (2-2 from
3-pt. range) and 4 rebounds in just 15
minutes of action. Ali Ton served out 5
assists and nabbed 2 steals, and earned
his coach’s praise for a host of intan-
gibles he provided. “Ali didn’t have a
tremendous night numbers-wise, but
was still very central to our success,”
said McKillop.

For UTC, Idris Harper finished
with 17 points, and Mare Smith had 10
rebounds.

‘Cats put Citadel through “‘basic training”

After jumping out to an early 16
point lead, the Davidson Wildcats were
able to hold off the fiesty Citadel Bull-
dogs for a 70-60 victory. The win
moved the Wildcats to 9-7 overall and

dropped to 6-

11 and 0-7 in the conference.

Citadel’s only lead of the game
was a 4-2 lead with 18:04 to play in the
first half. In the next five minutes
Davidson went on an 18-0 run sparked
by Brian Turner’s two three-pointers.
Chadd Holmes’s layup with 12:58 to
play in the first half gave the Wildcats a
20-4 lead.

The lead did not last long, though,
as the Citadel bombed their way back
into the game from three-point land.

“We thought it would be easy to

score,” said Coach Bob McKillop, “but
an 18 point lead evaporated in a matter
of minutes.”

The Wildcats scored the last five
points of the half for a 37-31 halftime
lead, capped off by Davor Halbauer’s
60-foot prayer to end the half.

The Bulldogs shot an amazing
64.3% from three-point land in the-first
half on 9-of-14 shooting. The Bulldogs
only connected on two shots inside the
arc the entire first half.

Citadel was able to get as close as
two points early in thé second half, but
they never could manage to tie or take
the lead against the Wildcats.
time Citadel had a little run, Davidson
had the answer, but the Wildcats were
never able to really put away the Bull-
dogs.

The Wildcats were led by Landry
Kosmalski’s 15 points and six rebounds.
Davor Halbauer had 11 points, and Ali
Ton had seven points and 10 assists.
The game marked Ton’s sixth double
digit assist game. Ben Ebong had a

Every,

great game off the bench with 10 points,
five rebounds, five assists, and three
steals.

Brian Turner showed off his ex-
plosive scoring abilities with nine points
in nine minutes off the bench.

Eight different Wildcats attempted
a three-pointer, paced by Davor

WRESTLING

Halbauer’s eight attempts. As a team,
the Wildcats shot 35.7% (10-28) from
long range. When the Citadel began
hitting their threes, the Wildcats began
to force up more threes of their own.

“It’s asimple response to answer a
three with your own three,” said
McKillop.

It definitely wasn’t the prettiest
game of the year, but the Wildcats were
able to hold off a Citadel team that got
very hot from three-point land, and in
the words of Coach McKillop, “A win
in conference play is a win.”

Wrestlers pinned in three straight matches

The weekend of January 16-18
was not a memorable one for the Wild-

cat wrestlers as they lost all three of

their matches. The ‘Cats fell to Duke by
a score of 28-12, then to Virginia Tech
40-3, and finally they were shut out by
VMI 42-0.

On January 16 Davidson faced in
state rival Duke at home but was unable
to capitalize on the home arena advan-

tage. Junior Ian Kaplan continued his
season-long winning ways by captur-
ing his match 3-2. Freshman Jeff Storms
had a thrilling overtime victory for the
Cats, prevailing 5-3, and sophomore
Dan Carman won his match by forfeit.

The next two matches against Vir-
ginia Tech and VMI, held in Blacksburg,
VA at Virginia Tech, proved even less
successful for the Wildcat wrestlers.
Kaplan was the only Davidson wrestler
to obtaina victory against Virginia Tech,
defeating his opponent in an incredible
overtime match. Kaplan was notas suc-
