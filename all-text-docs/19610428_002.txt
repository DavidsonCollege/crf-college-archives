Thefts Bring Disgrace

We are frankly ashamed of the
lead story in tonight’s paper. We are
ashamed of what it reflects on our
honor system and the college, wheth-
er the thefts were committed by stu-
dent or outsider or both.

Two weeks ago we ran an article
by Scott Lacy, past Honor Court chair-
man, revealing the extent of stealing
on campus. It was accompanied by an
editorial calling for caution and con-
cern. We hoped we were through with
the subject. This week’s thefts chang-
ed that.

Stealing has now extended beyond
the student body with the theft of
money and wallets from VPI athletes
on campus. Their coach admitted the
members of his team were negligent,
just as many Davidson students have
been. He was almost apologetic.

The boys themselves said it was.
their fault. They were surprised by i

the concern shown by our Honor
Court. Missing items on athletic trips

was nothing new, they explained. This
type of thing happens everywhere.

But it doesn’t have to happen here,
and we have every right to be alarmed
that it did. Before, when the stealing
problem was just a “family affair,’
students did not seem overly concern-
ed. Now the school as a whole is
involved in the eyes of outsiders.

The losses suffered by guests on
the campus bother us. We think that
money should be sent them with the
official apologies going from the col-
lege and student body, and we believe
Davidson students would prefer to
make up that $41 themselves. The
Student Council and Honor Court
are considering possible ways of doing
that.

Campus attitudes this week have
convinced us that Davidson students
are concerned now—about the VPI
boys and our own honor system. We
hope this new concern will help
bring real results in halting such dis-
graces. The Honor Court cannot solve
the problem alone.

Ambassadors Of Good Will

Tonight the Male Chorus sings for
us, after a tour of the country which
included stops in Virginia, Maryland,
New Jersey, and New York City.

In New York, they wound up sing-
ing a complete concert when a late
plane kept Dean Johnston from speak-
ing to the New York Alumni Asso-
ciation. A Davidson alumnus is en-
thusiastic over the possibilities of

making recordings, for sale, of the
chorus. At least one chorus member |

was offered a job.

Donald Plott’s roving good-will am-
bassadors also visited Hollins and W.C.
of U.N.C., where the name of Davidson
hardly needs boosting. But at such
schools as Princeton and Mount Holy-

oke, their appearance no doubt
brought the inevitable “Davidson?
Where's that?”

But during the last few years,
Dayidson’s Male Chorus has toured
almost every state in the East, sing-
ing at schools, churches, and alumni
gatherings. Wherever possible, mem-
bers stay in homes of local residents.
Davidson alumni are their biggest
fans, though they almost always re-
ceive return invitations wherever they

Nees

The chorus probably has done more
to spread the name and fame of David-
son than any other college organiza-
tion. We’re proud to give them credit.

‘Hats Off’ To Henry

In a brief ceremony in student as-
sembly last week, the 1960-61 Student
Council stepped down for the new
council to take over student govern-
ment.

The retiring council, headed by
Henry Shue, deserves praise for its
vigorous, constructive work during the
past year.

The revised Student Body Constitu-
tion passed by the student body on
March 9 was the product of six
months of work and study by a com-
mittee made up of Hutton Barron,
George Trask, Ken Kelley, and Nat
Watson. Article X of the revised con-
Stitution gives the council power to
effect changes in the by-laws by a 34
vote of the council. This will allow the
council to act quickly and efficiently
on problems as they arise.

The revised constitution replaced
the Court of Control with a new
Freshman Court headed by the Fresh-
man Advisor, who is elected by the
rising senior class. The spirit of the
new court embodies a more construc-
tive attitude toward freshman, with
the best interests of the freshman
class its primary concern.

Besides these two important chang-

es, the revised constitution does away
with the verbose, involved former
constitution of which the council even
had a hard time finding a single com-
plete copy.

In December, the council sliced the
“under the influence of alcohol”

clause from the drinking rule, reliev-
ing the student body of responsibility
of enforcing the rule.

The success of the Freshman Court
will depend on the personalities of
the men appointed to it last week, and
the wisdom of deleting the “under the
influence” clause from the drinking
rule will depend on the maturity
shown by the student body.

Retiring Student Body President
Henry Shue’s consistently strong lead-
ership this year has brought a new
prestiege to the Student Council and
to the office of president. The success
of the council is to a large extent a
reflection of his courage, sincerity,
and ability. Through his untiring de-
votion to the duties involved in the
office and his academic achievements,
Shue has made a record at Davidson
which should provide a real challenge
to his successors.

Epes Finds Honors Program Lacking

BY HANSFORD EPES

EDITOR'S NOTE:

Senior Hansford Epes
has been participating in
English Honors for two
years. He consented to
eveluate the pregrem beeed
en his experiences, for
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

In English Honors, six
members of the present sen-
ior class enrolied in the pro-

gram at the beginning of
their junior year; four of
these remain. Last fall, four
juniors enrolled; two of these
dropped out at the end of the
first semester.

The reason? In more than
one case, discontent with the
program — the disappoint-
ment of realizing that Honors
does not work nearly as well
as it sounds.

It is somewhat frustrating
to find that seminars—sup-
posedly the opportunity for

otimulating discussion within
a small group of “scholars”

the professor; to find that
the opportunities for students
to loaf and get by are great,
and are taken advantage of:
and especially to find that
the Honors student probably
knows less about the sudject
than someone taking it in
class, .

the blame for this falls on

Sends Letter From Vienna

Dear Members of the Student
Body,

This year at Davidson has
been a particularity outstand-
ing one, characterized by
imaginative leadieship, note-
worthy accomplishment in
both our academic and extra-
curricular pursuts, and a
greatly accelerated flow of
ideas and information among
students and faculty alike.

With the epprosching
end of the semester |

would like to convey my
congratulations and thanks
to all those in the student
body who have contributed
their ideas and talents
toward making 1960-61 the
singularly productive year
that it has been, and in par-

ticular | wish to express on
behalf of the student body
sincere gratitude to Henry
Shue for his forceful lead-
ership as student body
president.

As a president contribut-
ing both original and crea-
tive leadership he deserves
our highest praise.

The goals we have realized
this year should serve only
as foundation blocks upon
which further improvements
and advances for the col-
lege can be built. You the
student body members and
the men you have elected
this spring as your repre-
sentatives hold the prémise
of making 1961-62~a year
ot achievement for the col-
lege and for yourselves.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Sparks Spears Salley, Abolition

Dear Editor:

A prostitute walks the
Streets of our land — dress-
ed in the materialistic dis-
guise of a whimpering, pa-
triotic bitch. She is disown-
ing her heritage and is at-
tempting to sell her chil.
dren into bondage.

In her hands she carries a
bullwhip and a branding iron;
she makes Calvaries of our
courts and burns the mark of
Cain on some of our sensi-
tive and most informed poli-
tical leaders. ‘

But she is not alone. The

‘well-meaning masses follow

behind her, wagging their
tongues and shaking their
barbed fingers at all those,
big or small, who oppose
her,

They do not intend to
ruin our land; rather they
insist that they are making
“safe for democracy” the
land we must give to our un-
born children.

CONSERVATIVES OPPOSED ©

Few conservatives on this
campus will articulate their
position, and some of them,
conservvative in all other
areas, oppose violently the
Unamerican Activities Com-
mittee. ,

The rest of this group de-

Regardless of the worth of
these publications, let us go
to the author of the Declera-
tion of Independence. In The
Main Currents of American
Thought Vernon L. Parring-
ton quotes Jefferson as writ-
ing:

“It is very dangerous to
consider the judges (or the
committee chairman) as the
ultimate arbiters of all con-
Stitutional questions.

“It is one which would
place us under the despotism
of oligarchy. .. Tne consti-
tution has erected no such
single tribunal, knowing that
to whatever hands confided,
with the corruptions of time
and party, its members would
become despots.”

MAJORITY DEFEND

Some will speak out against
the would-be-despots; some
of the apathetic will not care;
but the majority, with their

blue-blood naivete, will de-.

fend them.

“Operation Abolition,” the
anti-communism film shown
in the Union Ballroom a few
days ago, accused the stu-
dents who demonstrated
against the committee inves-
tigations in San Francisco
last May of being duped into

fend with generalizations and Timea

We thus heve before us
next year not the prospect
of complecently maintain-
ing the status quo at
Davidson, but rather the
challenge to achieve ex-
panded goals. 1

I would like to close with
my thanks to each of you for
your support and for the
fine group of men you have
elected as student-body offi-
cers ‘and Student-Council
members.

With best wishes for life-
long success to the class of
1962 and the anticipation of
seeing you all in Septem-
ber.

treason. If it wants to pre-
vent “treason,” why doesn’t
the federal government show
films against the American
tourists in Europe — Madras-
clad vultures who gobble car-
rion while flaunting their
wealth?

Or why don’t they make
a survey of the number of
Americans who are impartial-
ly informed as to the in-
fluence of Communism at
home and abroad? The num-
ber would be small.

MENACE REAL

The Communist menace is
real, It needs to be checked
at every opportunity. But
rather than make somewhat
futile attempts through al-
most Fascist organs of the
government which contribute
excellent propaganda to the
Communist party, the Ameri-
can government could silent-
ly and persistently extract
this menace from the land.

And if Americans want to
fight communism at home,
they should reorient them-
selves to the ideals of their
political founders and es-
pouse this cause of true
patriotism.

Ben Sparks

the student: It is easy to loaf
in this informal setup —
and we do it. No matter what
changes the faculty makes,
we, as students, must carry
our share of the responsi-
bility.

But there are flawe in the .

present administration of the
program. Seminars vary wide-
ly, but a “typical” semester
in one Honors subject, might
go like this:

The student signs up for
a seminar. A text is recom-
mended and rarely referred
to again; the professor out-
lines the course, assigning
papers to be due at certain
meetings, and possibly recom-
mends_ several secondary
sources. He then starts tell-
ing anecdotes. (The supply of
these is endless.)

PAPERS

Papers are written and
read. (This usually presents
a problem: write decent
papers on narrow topics and
neglect the major portion of
the subject matter; or read
and study the subject matter
and neglect the papers. How-
ever, upon learning that
papers are discussed in semi-
nars while subject matter
isn’t, students usually pay
more attention to papers —
if we do any work at all.)

More anecdotes; more pass-
ing mentions of books (es-
pecially if available in paper-
back); more name-dropping
(“The last time I talked to
Chaucer, he said. ..”); an
exam (‘Discuss anything.
Spend no more than three

hours on this.”); and that’s
the course,

I'm exaggerating; but may-
be this helps show where
‘some of the flaws are — and
taking steps to remedy.
some of these should not be
too hard. Just two things the
faculty could do would make
a great deal of difference:
(1) Learning to do papers of
this sort ts good training —
but simply not worth the pro-
portion of study time usually
spent on them; and (2)—with
all due respect, gentlemen,
but I think you could talk
less and say more.

This plus genuine work on
our part — should improve .
matters considerably. By this
work, I mean really sitting
down and studying the pri-
mary material; after all, con-
trary to general opinion, even
Honors students need to
learn facts. Honors would
thus be something more, not
less, than regular class work
—as it should be.

WORTH KEEPING

‘The Honors program is
worth keeping: it has great
potential for representing ed-
ucation at its best, but it
seems to be far from realizing
the ideal so glowingly de-
scribed through the rose-
colored glasses of the College
Catalogue.

This type of educational
program, when it lives up to
its potential can be very im-
portant to the college, and
can be expanded to include
far more students than it
now does. But before that
time, we need to reconsider
and improve Honors.

The nurse, a rather wasp-faced little woman,
cursed and extracted a blade from her garter.

“Any hives, boils, measles, rickets, yaws, mumps
or fever? Don't lie to me, you sniveling coward. Any
pox, tremors, palsy, itch, rot, rash or plague?”

...Meadaches? Colds? Minor pains of neuritis
or nevralgia? Any leprosy, elephantiasis or preg-
nancy in the lest ten days?”

Ignoring my screams, she deftly drained my finger
of its contents, pronounced me healthy and propelled
me to another station with a well-placed kick.

A burly ROTC sergeant caught me, pushed an
empty gallon jug into my hands, and pointed to a

oor.

“In dere, buddy. Wid all dem nurses. Watch
the one with the long teeth, though. Don’t turn
yer back on ‘er.”

Feigning calm, I crawled in the direction he point-
ed. I was scaling a tiled wall toward a window when
a smiling nurse’s aide pulled me down, rendered me
half-conscious with a high-heeled shoe, and led me
into the receiving room, a sort of clinical abbatoir
populated by nurses ane prostrate donors.

A sudden wild vision of the Nazi medical experi-
ments skittered across my mind.

“Stop trembling, now,” cooed my guide. _“‘It’ll
be over in a minute. You won't know what hit
you.”

She laid me on a table and left me to the con-
templation of my past sins, a pleasant diversion which
was shattered by the arrival of the bloodletter, a
hefty student nurse with glittering eyes and a grin
only a little less than maniacal.

“Aha,” she said by way of introduction. She
seized my arm, brandishing a long metal needle on
a plastic tube.

“Hold your breath and it won’t hurt so bad.”

I held my breath an inordinately long time, until
the stabbing pain in my arm caused me to faint.

She revived me with a sound slap.

“Uh, could you hold your breath again? |
can‘t seem to find a vein.” She aimed the needle

again.

“I just can’t understand it. They told us EVERY-
BODY has veins .. .” She squinted and waved the
needle confusedly after another try. “I guess Pll
have to try someplace else . . . Maybe there's a vein
in your neck or somewhere.”

She tried again.

“| just can’t unnerstand it. | tried it last night
with an orange and a ten-penny nail and it work-
ed fine.” —

She stilled my convulsions quickly with a blow to
the solar plexus.

With a last effort she found a vein, then left me
to listen to an ominous gurgling in the jug.

“You're bleeding fine,” she said cheersly.
“Didn't hurt a bit, did it?”
