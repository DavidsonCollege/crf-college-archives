HONOR ROLL

Bill Taber Picks Bill Dyerly and Frank Parker
: As Indoor Track Stars ..

By HARRY KUYKENDALL
The following bits oi hews irom

the Wildcats’ baseball camp may
not have originated jrom_Florida or
Catalina fike the big Icaguers, but
one thing is certain. the locals have
just as much enthusiasm as the
Deanes themselves. They're glad
to get back to the old sandlor.
Approximately thirty = men
showed up for Flake Laird’s
initial drill Monday and went
through their paces after a brief
limbering up. Among the rook-
ies reporting were Bill Quick,
Hank Loftin, Johnny Partridge,

Jack Summerville, Asbury
Howard, Jim Dickson, “Judge”
Cathey; Carlos Young, and

“Robt. E. Lee” Heake, veterans
of last year’s squad. Other
members who haven't appeared
for practice because of football
or other engagements are Tom
Corbin, Wood Burns, and Jagk
Jenkins. These men are ex:
pected later. From last year’s
frosh team comes “E” and “G”
Ganier, Elwood Moyer, Bill
Bankhead, Joe Kellam. Bill
Manson, Jewell McLaurin, and
possibly “Teeny” Lafferty,
Spencer Goodman, Beiley Wil-
liams, and one or two others
after spring football terminates.
Newcomers to the squad are
Bill Yearwood, Milton Crisp,
Doug Neal, Bill Yelverton, Don
Stuart and Luther Morris.

In talking over plans for the sea-
son, Laird stated that he wanted
to give plenty of individual atten-
tion this year. “Wark. attitude, and
cifort will go a long way in de-
termining who makes the team. All
we want to do is put the nine best
boys out dere and as far as’ I'm
concerned. there are nine places
open for any man who is willing
-ta_work for then.”

Flake stated that he had been in-
formed that Davidson “won't have
much of a ball club” this year, but
I don't see why. We have some
good boys ‘here. a good schedule.
and .we want to make a_ better
showing.” Manager Leniield  sec-
onded Laird with “we're gonna’
have a state championship team.”

Track Coach Pete Whittle
stated “our men came along
fine” at the indoor track meet

in spite of the lone point made °

by the ’Cats. Bill Dyerly, who

placed fourth in the non-con-
ference 70 yard high hurdles,
ran “the best we've ever seen
him run” added. Pete. “Most
of our men were in too fast
company.” Whittle pointed .out
that there was more competi-

tion in the non-conference di-

vision than in the more popu-

lar conference events. “I be-
lieve he (Dyerly) would have
tied for first” in the latter.

TL

Pete also had plenty oi praise for
Walker, a freshman who, although
he was. boxed into a fourth place,
showed splendid promise. “It was
the best indoor mect they've had”
said Pete in closing.

“Doc” Newton came in ofor. a
share of the interviewing and when
asked_about chances. for breaking
even on next year’s grid schedule.
replied “I don't see how we can
do that.” Tlowever, Doc pointed
out that they are “doing pretty
well” in spring practice, indicating
possibilities for some upsets,

When asked “who is going to
do the kicking?” Coach replied
that he was giving a lot of per-
sonal attention to Lafferty. “If
he improves in the next two
weeks like he has in the last
few days, he'll be O. K. In dis-
cussing frext year’s schedule
with Navy, Newton added that
the midshipmen showed “an

awful lot of weaknesses” in their

game with Army this. fall.

Newton will coach the frosh base-
ball team this year for the first
time, and Jocal fans are hoping that
he'll have some of the: success that
characterized his world champion

“nine this past summer.

Davidson's. experienced and for-
midable golf team will be coached
this year by Bill McGavock. , The
new mentor, who perhaps is better
known as Professor McGavock, is

In the first game. both teams
showed the need of practicing to-

hampered both teams — severely.
Matching the Greys’ power thrusts
with oan: aerias attack, the Keds
chalked up the lone score of the
game when Parks Jland snagged a

remaining ten yards for ‘a. touch-

John Armstrong gnd Dick Cathey
were tight tHere the entire season,
coming in very often to take up
the hght when the going got tough.

Throughout the stason it was
very evident that one of the prin-
cipal faults of the Wildcats was
their erring aim. especially when
they cut loase with a doul shot. +

This is what Coach Flake Laird
had 10 say when asked to comment
on the team and season naw that
smoke of baitle has blown
away, “I thought they played good
basketball toward the end ‘ol, tlie
season and all of their gathes then
overe close, scrappy ones. We won't
loge a single man from the squad
next year_andwe-shauld hase-a
much better team, too. if the boys
will wet out this spring and wofk
hard.” Coach exyressed the opin-
ion when presses! as to -the smain
iault of the Qnine that. “The inabil-
ity to hit the basket. was the prin-
cipal deficieney, and good defensive
ball the best point of the team.”

Co-Captain Hilly Quick expressed
the. following ideas at the end oi
the scason, “The team was ham-
pered by inexperience and lack of
height. but we will not iose a man
next year and will be in much bet-
ter form, They will have to reckon
with us next year.” This last, Capt.
Quick said quite emphatically, Ele
itlso expressed Hopes of an’ invita-
tion to the conference tournament,

are. some goog Freshmen coming
up next year, and, too, we will have

Popular speculation over — the
strength of-this year’s tennis team
appeared to ineline to a very hope-
ful outlook, as the annual spring
tournament went iio its second
found yesterday, and the courts
swarmed*with activity.

The six net artists who will most
often represent Davidson on the
courts this spring will probably bc]
Qpawn from a field of four letter-
men and two reserves from last
year’s varsity squad, and the two
top-ranking members of last year’s
ireshman team, but it is still too
carly to determine in what) order
these men will rank. Captain Car-
lyle Lewis appears t& be a sure bet
for the

number one position, in
view of his wide and successful
tournament experience and gaod

“Tite Greys’ power was too much| showing in othe top-ranking posi-

for the fighting Rets, and Teeny
Lafferty’s ssoond touchdown sprint
proved the winning imargin. Ed
Armfield accounted tor both of the
loser’s scores with Jong runs, but
Batley Williams’ superb down-field
blocking was largely instrumental
for both seores. Walferty’s. first
seore came after a 10-yard run, and
‘Tom Corbin bucked over for a sec-
ond much - disputed

tion on last year’s team. The shoes
of Phifer and Elvery, numbers two
and four Jast year, will be amply
filled by the two sophomore Mmem-
bers of this year’s squad, Bronston
Kenny and tarry Frampton, who
may see service in about those same
positions on the 1936 team. Jake

gin was 19-14, .

The score now stands at two. for
the Reds and one fot the Greys,
but in the remaining two weeks,

Olympic Sectional Tryouts
Also to Be Held

Davidson College will be hosts
to the A. A. U. and Olympic, try-
outs here on March 13th and Ith.
The officials originally planned to
hold only the Amateur Athl@tic Un-
ion finals here but the two were
combined,

The Olympic sectional tryouts
wilt be held here at the same time
as the A..A. U. The rules for the
Olympic tryouts are vastly differ-
ent ftom the collegiate rules which
have been used here and through-
out the country for the past few
seisons. The collegiate rules call

H
for a ten minute, bout with both

contestants starting from a stand-
ring position and proceding with-
out time out except for an injury,
and of course ending with a fall.
The Olympic tryouts will differ in
that the contestants will be sub-
ject to a fifteen minute bout. The
wrestlers start at.a standing posi-
tion as in college competition and
continue for six minutes. Li dur-
ing the six minutes, one of the con-
leslants gaing a time advantage,
then his opponent has one point
scored against him by the judges.
there are_three judges and a ref-
eree. Vive of these points eliminates
a-contestant from further compe-
tition in the matches,

At the und of the six minute pe-
riod, then the referee flips a coin
to determine which of the wrestlers
goes “gown” first in the referee's
positidn.- For four and a half min-
utes, that contestant is officially
“down” and in the case he comes
out and gains an advantage over
his opponent, then one point — is
scored against the opponent, but
unless he pins his opponent while
“down,” he must give up that ad-
vantage and go “down” again until
the" four and a half minute period
is up. ‘The contestant who has a fall
scored against him is aytomatically
eliminated. 1i the match is not
won by a fall, the three judges de-
termine the winner by the “point”
system,

During the past season, the Wild-
cat matmen won five of their nine
inatches, and-lost by slim margins,
four matches to Appalachian, (by 2
points), to V. BP. L. (by 20 points),
to N. C. State (by 6 points), to. U.
N.C. (by 2 points). The Wildcats
scored 153% points to their op-
ponents 123V.

Coacti “Doc” Unger used fifteen
men throughout the season. The
most outstanding of ethese were:
Captain Blackwelder, who won all
matches this season. Blackwelder
has won 21 straight victories. Bluc
won four bouts. Hodgin and Parker
won © and 7 bouts respectively. Da-
vis won 2 bouts, McFadyen won 3,
and Owen, Summerell, Crabb and
Drown AVOM' 1 match each.

WHO DID?

It was. decided that two small
boys, brothers, and a neighbor's
son? should all have their tonsils
temoved at the same time. Never
jhaving been ina hospital betore,
they were all bright-eyed and cu-
rious. The three. of them were in
one room and when the nurse
came in to take their temperatures
before the operations, they watched
with eager eyes
were bursting with questions, they
fell respectively silent until she had
removed the thermometers, taken
the readings. and was about to teave
the room. ‘Then the youngest could
restrain himself no longer and
blurted eagerly; “Who won?”
