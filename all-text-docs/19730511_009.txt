Some Funny Things Happened. —_eo May 11, 1973
To Me Going To The Derby

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

With the lack of sporting
events occurring on the David-
son campus last weekend, this
reporter-saw fit to see one of the
great sporting events of the
year.

Louisville, Ky. is a long way
away but it was well worth the
effort to be in the Kentucky Der-
by crowd. I was among the
134,000 people who witnessed
the biggest horse race of the
year.

This is.not to say that I had a

great view of the Derby because
those people who watched it on
television had a much better
idea of what was going on than I
did standing in the infield.

I got to see the horses twice,
once right after the start and
then again when they were
about 250 yards from the finish
line. The rest I had to find out
from the race announcer.

Someone might ask why
someone would go all the way to
Kentucky just to see the horses
twice. Before I went I was
asking myself the same
question.

Tne answers to this question
were many-fold after coming
back.

First would have to be trip out
to Kentucky. A freshman, John
Mitchell, and myself could not

conviice an Owner of a car on
campus to go to the Derby. So
we started hitch-hiking at about
6:30 Friday morning. We got a
ride to Statesville and then it
took us three rides to get to
Hickory, where we waited one
hour for our next ride.

The ride however, was well
worth the wait as we were
picked up by a man who was
driving a van loaded with car-
pets to Knoxville. This was my
first experience since arriving in
the South three years ago with a
member of the KKK.

He did not talk that much
about the Klan. But since he did
drive his route many times a
week, he let us in on all the
houses of ill-repute which could
be found between Hickory and
Knoxville.

He also related to us many
stories of looking into cars from
his van. We even stopped to see
a girlfriend of his who worked in
a truck stop. She was the same
age as his oldest daughter.

After veing droppea off by
him, my Davidson education
came into use as we were
picked up by a black minister.
Without even thinking about it
we changed our topic of con-
versation from sex to God.

After a short ride with the
minister we were picked up by
three Tennessee frat men in a
pickup truck loaded with beer.

Coaches ‘Enthusiastic’

By CHRIS YOUNG
Staff Writer

The 1973-74 Wildcat basket-
ball coaching staff looks to the
coming season with enthusiasm
and an air of optimism.

The team will play an ex-
tremely challenging schedule,
featuring such _ nationally
prominent teams as St. John's,
N.C. State and Notre Dame.

The Charlotte Invitational
Tournament should provide
some fine, high-spirited basket-
ball as Syracuse, Miami of Ohio
(both of which participated in
this year’s NCAA regionals)
and Loyola of Chicago come
South to the home away from
home of the Davidson Wildcats

- Charlotte Coliseum.

Head coach Terry Holland in-
dicated the goals of next year’s
squad are very similar to those
of this past year. These include
a _top-20 rating. a 20-win season
and a berth in the NCAA
Eastern regionals.

Holland stated that the team
wants to play against the best
competition available, and that
he was pleased that they will be
playing such teams as NC. State
and Notre Dame while they are
national contenders.

He noted that the difficult
schedule naturally reflects it-
self in the team’s record, but
that if they do attain their goals
it will have been a worthwhile
achievement.

Holland pointed out that ‘‘we
only lose two players from our
varsity — one of whom played a
substantial amount. We have
nine returning varsity players,
all of whom have scored in
double figures and played quite
abit.” -

' ine Wildcats’ strength
definitely lies in its perimeter
players (guards and forwards).
all of wnom are exceptionally
good shooters and ball han-
dlers.

The major problem facing the
Wildcat basketball program is.
the need for a strong, steady,

tall cemer. Much of the weight
would appear to fall on 6'7"
Larry Horowitz, 69° Sheldon
Parker and69" Eppa Rixey.

Unfortunately, Holland said
that there were no 611" - 7° big
men who could come to David-
son next year, although it looks
like 6'9° Steve Trusgnich will
enroll at Davidson this fall.

In the Southern Conference,
Furman expects to be very
strong again next year despite
the loss of two starters. Fessor

Leonard (7'2"') and Clyde
Mayes (6’9"") will anchor the
Furman squad.

William and Mary should be
extremely improved as should
Richmond (which sports such
features as a new gymnasium,
new players and old stalwart
Aaron Stewart).

It appears that the success of
the Davidson Wildcats next
year will lie with the ability of
the players to compensate in
some way for the lack of a big
man, and with the effectiveness
of the Wildcat pressure defense.

to Louisville for a little gas |

money. By the time we arrived
in Louisville, the pickup did not
have any beer left, the driver
consuming a healthy nine bot-
tles.

Driving through Louisville,
we ran one red light and almost
hit a car. We made it to the
University of Louisville still in
one piece which was hard to
_believe.

Despite the infield being full
the stands were still fairly emp-
ty because that is where the big
money was sitting at over $15a
head. They did not show up until
just before the Derby.

Betting was another problem.
Each race there seemed to be
more people in line. It was not
uncommon to wait 20 minutes
just to make a $2 wage.

That night there were people

milling around everywhere and —

there were a few parties. U.L.
had just finished their exams
and there were very few studen-
ts from there around. Most of
the people were ftom Ohio, Ten-
nessee or Kentucky. There were
a few from N.C.aand some from
Virginia.

After a short night of par-
tying, it was time for the rack
since we hoped to make it to
Churchill Downs around nine
the next morning.

Upon arriving at the track,
we paid $5 to be able to sit in the
infield (the worst seats in the
house). Last year it was only $3
but they wanted to keep the
‘‘hippies”’ out.

The first race started at 11:30
and by that time a good deal of
the infield was drunk on liquor
which somehow passed through
the gates illegally.

By this time the infield was
wall to wall people and walking
from one side of the track was
like running an obstacle course.
It was well worth the fight as
there-were good looking girls all
the place. It seemed you bum-
_ped into one every five seconds.
over the place. It seemed you
bumned into one every five

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

The fine art of foosball as practiced by these two individuals, is
one of the most popular sports at Davidson. In light of foosball’s
growing popularity, the Union is sponsoring a tournament. Semi-
final action will take place on Monday night and the final will be
played on Tuesday night at the Rathskeller.

I got in this line at about 2:10
and was asked by a girl if she
was in the right line. She was.

By the time we got close to the
window, it was almost three
o'clock. I pushed my way into
the window and made my bet. I
looked back and the girl had not
been able to follow me so with a
move that would have made

Coach Holland envious I used a

Those receiving aid this year received forms

and pulled her into the window.

I got lucky on the race before
the Derby which made me even
and then got close enough to the
fence to see Secretariat pass
Sham on the stretch, which
made my day.

I have been at many sporting
events where I have seen more
of the acton of the participants.
But at very few have I seen this
much action by the fans or had
more fun.
