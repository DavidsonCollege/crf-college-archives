THE DAVIDSONIAN

_OPINIONS

Evolution of
(Davidson) man

Having given the freshman a few
words of advice, I thought it might
be nice to give the ones who lived
through First Night downa glimpse
of what the next couple of years
are going to be like. Not knowing
the first thing about women, I had
to confine myself to Davidson men.

1st Semester: General emotional
state: Nervous, excited, hyper, but
for the most part, healthy.

Having come from high
school, where the only thing easier
than getting liquor is getting beer,
first semester freshman will have
one major change to deal with- no
kegs at Davidson parties. Not that
they go to parties anyway. Social
activities center around throwing
up out of various dorm room win-
dows, fighting*with a roommate,
and saran wrapping toilet seats. A
major weekend would include
dropping a watermelon down the
Belk stairs, which is pretty funny
unless you’re the guy drunk enough
to try to catch it; and watching a
movie starring lots of actresses with
one name. Once the Court opens
up, new freshman are exposed to
the exciting world of vicious up-
perclassmen, stale beer, and large
policemen. The main academic
pursuits of the first semester fresh-
man are finding classes in Cham-
bers and figuring out where all the
women from the face book have
gone.

2nd Semester: General emotional

LIFE IN
WELL

state: Nervous as hell, screechy,
fragile, but generally not unhealthy.

After the spectacularly mis-
named Self Selection Night, the
frat- boy wanna be’s are quickly
introduced to the joys of pledging,
such as public exposure to both the
elements and entire the student
body, waking up in unfamiliar and
economically disadvantaged sec-
tions of strange cities, and becom-
ing brothers with twenty new guys
‘who are exactly like you, right
down to the almost new Eddie
Bauer Explorer. . On the flip side,
you get lots of free beer, whether
you want it or not. For guys who
don’t pledge, the main social ac-
tivity is making fun of those who
do. Academic pursuits include
sleeping through a mindless litany
of survey courses, or worse,
Humes, and explaining to Dad why
that scholarship wasn’t really that
important anyway.

3rd Semester: General Emotional
State: Wary, frustrated, edging to-
ward psycosis.

Social activities of the third
semester freshmen, or sophomores,
as they are also called, are centered
around endless frat parties, falling
off of high places like tables, desks,
fraternity walls,etc and blacking
out. Intense sexual frustration sets
in after being turned down by nine
freshmen and a check-out girl at
Lowe’s. (You know- the blond
one, works the Express Lane.)
Drastic measures, such as going to

’

Queens, only seem to make mat-
ters worse because the doctor’s
bills eat into your beer money.
Academically, sophomores are
asked to prove they are the genuises
they were told they were in high
school by answering questions like
“If Chairman Mao and a mature
sewer rat fought to the death, who
would win, and why? Discuss
using outside sources.” Nagging
questions about disturbing things
like direction and jobs keep com-
ing up.

4th Semester: General Emotional
State: A delicate balance between
suicidal and homocidal. Gener-
ally unheathly. Social activities are
the same, except now there are
pledges to bring you beer and roll
you onto your stomach. Take road
trips to every college and univer-
sity inthe Southeast but find no life
there either. After being the first
person in the history of Davidson
to be carded for cigarettes at
Dover’s, you briefly entertain the
idea of jumping off the watertower.
The drive for intellectual enlight-
enment stalls out around the first
day of spring, and is killed off by
the summer job prospects of either
being an office monkey fora group
of T.V.- advertizing mall lawyers
or working on the processing line
at the Tyson plant like all of your
highschool friends. Most sopho-
mores decide to go abroad the first
semester of their junior year. Don’t
say you weren’t warned.

Patterson Court Council

On “God Save the Court”

In response to some issues raised
and accusations made in the Opin-
ions article “God Save the Court”:

1. Confusing system? The system
was designed by the students in
an effort to soften the blow of
losing kegs on Patterson Court
and provide for a period of transi-
tion. The plan offers more op-
tions for the organizations and
gives the organizations more flex-
ibility and responsibility in man-
aging their own events. Each or-
ganization, in fact; has submitted
its own version of how it will doa
better job of distributing that in-
formation to ALL students, so
any confusion can be addressed.

2. Amount of personnel? The
number of required personnel at
is less than last year— and it’s
easier to identify someoneto work
the events! One Risk Manager
(from a list of over seventy TIPS
trained people as opposed to only
twelve last year), atleastone TIPS-
trained bartender, and at least one
entrance monitor to check ID’s,
PCC stickers, and distribute wrist-
bands. And police officers will
work in “zones” on the court to
monitor general safety and secu-
rity, not at every single house the
entire time like watchdogs. These
changes save the organizations
money AND offer more control
and responsibility to the organi-
zation.

3. Forms ‘and paperwork? The -

house, members, or guest have no
additional paperwork mandated
by the administration. Wristbands
and Patterson Court Stickers were
used in the past and continue to be
used. The houses register parties
in the same manner, although the
form has been simplified. The Risk
Managers complete the same
checklist as they have in the past,
which communicates party pro-
cedures and occurrences to the
Patterson Court Office after an
event.

4. Quantity limits? The quantity
limits are clearly outlined in Red
Book Section V.18 (page 31) for
organization-sponsored or com-
bination events and Section VI.3.b
(page 32) for BYO events (as the
bold-face heading indicates). A
typographical mistake labels
BYOB limits as VIII.3.b.

5. Organization Categories? Call-
ing an event “organization spon-

sored” is simply describing how
that event is different from the
other two categories of events.
Alternative suggestions for that
category’s label can be submitted
to the Patterson Court Council. It
does not violate any terms of the
women’s eating houses’ insur-
ance policies, so the issue is re-
ally whether the College should
be disguising reality for the ben-
efit of thee fraternities who are
making informed decisions about
their event management. The
Patterson Court Council is un-
aware that any officers have re-
signed over this issue, but the
policy changes offer more oppor-
tunities for protection if the orga-
nizations have knowledge of and
are adhering to their individual
risk management policies.

6. Anti-Court sentiment? The in- |
famous Self-Study document
clearly indicates the College’s
willingness to maintain Patterson
Court as an institution. In fact, it
supports the growth of the court
through its recommendation
championing ‘a fourth women’s
eating house or a co-ed eating
house. Students and staff worked
together throughout the spring to
address some concerns about
Patterson Court operations and
remain united about the value of
the Patterson Court experience
for many students and alumni.
Patterson Court as a viable aspect
of campus life will continue, but
it does not exist in a vacuum. As
asociety evolves and continually
redefines such issues as organi-
zational liability and personal
freedoms and responsibility,
Patterson Court will also evolve
to meet these challenges with
enough confidence in its purpose
and processes that it can with-
stand scrutiny, accept construc-
tive criticism, and set the stan-
dard for personal and organiza-
tional excellence.

7. Purpose of the Court? We fi-
nally agree on something. The
court is about leadership, service
and friendship. The well-rounded
Davidson undergraduates it helps
to produce are important, which
is why we found it worth saving.
Patterson Court save Patterson
Court.

The Patterson Court Council
meets at 7:00 p.m. on Sundays in
the Union Conference Room.
Guests are always welcome.
