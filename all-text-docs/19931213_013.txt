A legend makes his way to stardom

Ducas continued from page 11

form. By the end of the summer, I
knew every word on the tape and
could even play a few tunes my-
self.

The summer, however, ended,
and Caleb returned to Vanderbilt-
-with his tape. It took me nearly
four months but I finally found
someone to drive me to Nashville.
At about 10:30 last Friday night, a
few friends and I walked into
Amie’s, sat down, and put our feet
up.

I’m not sure what I expected,
but what I found in that tiny bar
seemed to match those expecta-
tions exactly. I found George
Ducas, clad in denim and boots,
strumming a black Takamine cut-
away. He was standing--I remem-
ber that struck meas peculiar. But,
there he was standing, strumming,
and singing to a half-inebriated
and half-captivated audience.

As far as Icould tell, those that
weren’tlistening were either drink-
ing or telling the people next to
them how great he was. After the
applause died down, I shouted
“Since you left town’” and without
hesitation, George said: “by re-
quest” and smiled.

He played mostly originals,
but strayed into a little Jerry Jeff,
Grateful Dead, and quite a bit of
Dwight Yoakam.

The crowd, predominately
college kids and regulars, knew all
the words. “I needto do one for
Caleb,” George said and drifted
back into his music with “Without
you,” another original.

He knew most everybody by
name, and they knew him. After
he finished a set, George came
down off the stage and laughed
and drank with the rest of us. Ap-
parently, a friend of mine had told
him who I was and where I came
from. He came over, introduced
himself, and asked me to stick
around after the show. I think I
was caught off guard by his friend-
liness.

After a while, he got back up
on stage for another set. Sally
Smithwick, another singer trying
to make her own luck in Nashville,
was there with her boyfriend, and
below the barrage of requests, she
asked for “Blue Eyes Cryin’ in the
Rain.” Whether he loved the song
or she just smiled and melted his
heart, I couldn’t tell. He played it
so well, even Willie himself would
have cried.

Scott Lenhart, her boyfriend
and my traveling companion,
leaned over to me and voiced his
concern. “I don’t blame you,” was
all I said, and laughed. I knew
George was engaged, but decided
to let Scott boil for a little while.

He played on fora couple more
sets. “This is the first song I ever
wrote [he was twelve], I won’t be
playing it on tour next year.” We
all felt a little honored. It was
“Women and Whiskey,” and I won-
dered about what kind of kid this
guy must have been.

He played an old Foster and
Lloyd tune, a few other originals,
and finally closed, around two, with
a rendition of “Dueling Banjos”
that left us speechless.

He put down his guitar,
climbed off the stage, and sat down
with us. Honestly, I think I asked
only one question. After that, Sally
and Caleb bombarded him, and I
did little but write.

He hails from Texas City,

.Texas, and was raised in Califor-

nia and Houston before making his
way to Nashville.

He graduated from Vanderbilt
in ‘89 intent on becoming a busi-
ness man, but after a year working
in a bank, he realized his future lay
elsewhere.

Though he started playing
when he was twelve, the music
industry was something he had
never thought about, and kind of
“stumbled into this situation” when
a friend asked him to play in
Calhoun’s, a bar down the road. A
little later he found his way into
Amie’s. That was three and a half

years ago.

As to his future, George is
humbly reserved. He recently
signed with Liberty Records (Garth
Brooks’ label) and his single is due
for release in September. He plans
to start touring and hopefully open
for some bigger artists.

Despite his friendship with
Radney Foster, George has no plans
to accompany him on tour. He
doesn’t want to “ride in on the
coattails” of anyone else. No mat-
ter what happens, he plans on main-
taining the integrity he’s kept thus
far.

When asked about his emi-
nent stardom, George was pen-
sive. “The closer I get to it, the
more different it becomes... . It
becomes real life.”

Ihave no doubt you’!I be hear-
ing George on the radio before too
long. I kind of regret it, though.
I’ve only got few months to
make it to Nashvi int to see
him/play before he rounds up a
band and hits the road.

If you’re heading that way and
needa driving partner, let me know
(I’m serious). If we can make it
there by eleven or so on a Friday
night, I’m game.

Before we left Amie’s in the
wee hours of Saturday morning, I
asked George for his autograph.
He laughed (it was something he
wasn’t used to), and took my pen
and pad.

- Best of luck, Geoff!
Thanks for my first interview
ever! :
George Ducas
Thanks for my first interview,
George, and I’d wish you the best
of luck, but I don’t think you’ll
need it. Merry Christmas, every-
one, and have a happy holiday!

Special thanks to Caleb Clarke
for making this interview
possible, Also thanks to Scott
Lenhart, without whom this
interview would never have
happened.
