port should go a long way. Taken as a
whole the first year men seemed to be weak
with the willow, and a little slow in the field,
but probably their coming trip through the
state will bring them around a little better.

Games with the Blue Devils from Duke
and the Mountain Bears from Lenoir-Rhyne
are on deck this week. Lenoir-Rhyne should
be conquered without serious difficulty, but
Duke will take about all the 'Cats have.
However, it is the general opinion that’ the
winning streak of the Wildcats will not be
broken by the Durhamites. Wake Forest
beat the Devils last week, and all this speaks
well for the local’s chances.

For the second straight year, the Kittens
took Bingham Military Academy into camp
in the dual track meet here Saturday. Tom
Neal won all three dashes by as fine an ex-
hibition of sprinting as a Freshmgf has ever
given here. Brock and McCall showed form
in the pole vault and broad jump respectively.
A pleasant touch of variety was added to the
meet by the interspersion of the Freshman
carnival, a feature of Soph Day.

Davidson’s. easy win over Wake Forest
on the track Saturday was featured by the
showing of the Sophomores. Whittle, bro-
hard, McGavock, Gardner and Lafferty all
took first places, while Gene Smith tied for
a place in the pole vault. Give Tilson a
couple of first-class distance men, and David-
son will have a track teanfto rank with the
best of them, It is probable that next sea-
son will see the development of some of the

He finally had to give up the work, and

}to respond to treatment there, government
officials decided that the Colorado @limate
would probably benefit him. He did show
some improvement, but it was only tempo-
rary. Friends had learned a month before
his death that the once strong athletic body
could not survive the attack much longer.

The body of Mr. White was brought to his
old home in Danielsville, Ga., for burial.
Besides his parents he is survived by his
wife, Mrs. Ann Cantrell White, who was

extended to win in the meet Saturday. He
did the 100 in 10:02, which is not exactly
loafing, you know. Watch him in the State

Pathe News shown at the local theater last
week had some fairly good action shots from
the Tech Relays. There was Johnnie Currie
along with another North Carolina boy,
Harper, of the University. Currie could be
identified in the shot of the 100 yard dash.
After seeing this picture, John is reported
to have started to Hollywood to capitalize
