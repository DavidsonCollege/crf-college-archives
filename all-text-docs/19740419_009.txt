Netters Bow To App

To Furman In Co

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

The Davidson tennis team
ran into some hard luck this
week as they dropped two
losses to the top two teams in
the Southern Conference.

Appalachian crushed the
Cats on Tuesday by a score of
90. Furman completed the
two-day fiasco by ripping the
Cats 5-1, in a rain-delayed
match.

“I cannot say that I am
disappointed because we lost
to two really good teams,”
commented head coach Jeff
Frank. “Sure, I wanted to win
some of the games for pride
and other things. But when
you lose to teams like them;

well, there is not much you
can say.”’

There were three matches
that went to three sets in the
Mountaineer contest. The
Cats, of course, lost all three.

“They played the best mat-
ch they have played the entire
season, a i to their
coach,” Frank explained. ‘I
knew in order to beat them,
ey aay have to have an off

y. it was pretty obvious that
they did not have anything of
that sort.”’

Frank went on to express
that they were just a better
team, man-for-man.

The Furman match could
have been closer.

except for Bill (Allen) at the
explained

ference by a tally of 6-2, 6-2.

“I think Bill just felt he
could beat him,’’ noted Frank.
“And he certainly did that.”

The reason for the short
score of 5-1 was due to the rain
which forced the cancellation
of all three doubles matches.
The Cats had split the two sets
in the top doubles bracket and
were down one set in the num-
ber two doubles, but had a
five-five tie in the second set.

John Mitchell ran his match
to three sets before dropping
the final one, 6-4.

‘These two games really do
not matter much as far as the
conference seedings go,”’
Frank commented. ‘‘As long
as it doesn’t matter whether
we finish third or fourth, we
really should not be too
discouraged.”’

In other matches this past
week, the Cats were more suc-
cessful on the road as they
edged VPI by a score of 54
and then bombed VMI, 8-1.

“‘We really did not have too
much trouble with either
team, although the VPI match
was very close,”’ said Frank.
“‘The two wins at least gave us
some momentum for the mat-
ches at home.”’

The Cats take to the road
again now as they visited

Frank noted that the Atlan-
tic Christian encounter would
be a very good match, since it

On a brighter note, Frank
announced the signing of his
third top prospect for the
coming year. He now feels he
has three of his top seven and
has his hopes on at least one or
two more.

Frank is very high on
Boswell. He is ranked third in

Frank classified as a very

Boswell had scholarship of-
fers from two top schools in
the Southeastern Conference.

“He is definitely a blue-

pleased to have him and know
he will contribute greatly to
our program in the coming
