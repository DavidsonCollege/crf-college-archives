Week in a Washington
Clinton offers new budget plan

By Davip SanTscui
Washington Week enrrere ree

After vetoing the Republican
budget package on Wednesday,
President Clinton unveiled an al-
ternative that he claimed would
balance the budget in seven years.

Using the pen that Lyndon
Johnson used to sign Medicare and
Medicaid legislation on July 30,
1965, Clinton reaffirmed his com-
mitment to preserving government
health programs. “With this veto,
the extreme Republican effort to
balance the budget through wrong-
headed cuts and misplaced priori-
ties is over,” said Clinton on
Wednesday. After the veto, Sen.
Pete Dominici (R-NM), the chair-
man of the Senate Budget Com-
mittee, wondered whether Clinton
truly “wants to produce a balanced
budget.”

Budget talks resumed Tues-
day after a five-day stalemate, with
both parties accusing each other of
distortion and bad faith. Clinton
produced his plan Thursday to blunt
Republican claims that he is ob-
structing the budget negotiations.
Republicans insisted that the
Democrats present a comprehen-
sive proposal as an alternative to
the plan Clinton vetoed.

Clinton’s budget differs little
from his last proposal in June. The
new budget cuts spending by $140
billion more than his previous plan.
The new proposals are relatively

minor: a five percent reduction in
unspecified domestic programs, a
new method of calculating infla-
tion that would reduce entitlement
payments, and the sale of govern-
ment assets. Clinton would also
raised the minimum hourly wage
from $4.25 to $5.15. Clinton re-
fused to cut “investments” in edu-
cation, job-training, and environ-
mental programs, and his tax, wel-
fare, and Medicare proposals are
virtually unchanged.

“We think it works. We think
it’s credible. We think it’s defen-
sible,” said White House Chief of
Staff Leon Panetta. But Rep. John
Katsch (R-OH) assaulted the plan
as “17 days late and $400 billion
short.” Other Republicans blasted
the plan as a repackaging of old
ideas. Despite such rhetoric, par-
ticipants in the budget negotiations
said the talks were more construc-
tive‘on Thursday with both plans
on the table. While neither plan

will pass as law, they will serve as _

a basis for further progress.

The main obstacles to a nego-
tiated budget are economic as-
sumptions, tax cuts, and Medicare
spending. Because each side in-
sists on using its own forecasting
agency in projecting economic
growth, Republicans and Demo-
crats are operating under different
economic assumptions. President
Clinton’s budget, which uses the
forecasts of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, is much more

optimistic than congressional Re-
publicans, who rely on the Con-
gressional Budget Office. Under
their differing projections, Repub-
licans would have to find $812 in
savings over seven years; Clinton
needs only $465 billion.
Substantive differences cen-
ter on taxes and Medicare, the fed-
eral health care program for the
elderly. The Republicans would
cut taxes by $245 billion; Clinton
proposes cuts of $98 billion. Con-
gress would cut $270 billion from
Medicare and $163 billion in Med-
icaid. The White House proposes
$124 billion from Medicare and

$54 billion from Medicaid. The

administration would not allow
medical savings accounts, which
Republicans strongly endorse. The
administration would keep Medic-

aid a federal program and merely .

trim its growth, but Republicans

_ would transfer control of the pro-

gram to the states.

The differing proposals illus-
trate strong ideological division.
Republicans are determined to re-
duce the size and influence of the
federal government, while Demo-
crats want to preserve federal con-
trol. While the status of the budget
negotiations changes constantly,
disagreement over the role of the
federal government is as old as the
nation itself.

Japan looks for economic quick-fix

By Eric Sapp
Deak Rusk Adjunct Reporter

Recently, one of the world’s
great countries disclosed a five-
year plan that gives detailed strat-
egies for how individual industries
are to be run and sets specific eco-
nomic targets for the future. But
that country wasn’t Russia return-
ing to Communism; it was Japan
trying to figure out some way to
get its economy back on its feet.

When most people think of
Japan, they do not think of a coun-
try that is running a deficit larger
than that of the United States. And
up until last year, they would have
been right.

Butrecently, Japan’s economy
has not been doing quite as well as
the government has expected and
they have been forced to go more
and more into debt. In fact, Japan
is predicting a governmental bud-
get surplus of five percent of the
GDP for 1996, a surplus that is
twice what the-United States is
expecting.

Some, like those who propose

“the new five-year plan, are blam-
ing Japan’s economic problems on
its strong governmental regulation
of industry. The new plan that
Japan has proposed is supposed to

address these problems. It will try.

to solve Japan’s immediate eco-
nomic woes by setting goals and
timetables for major deregulation
of industries to be carried out be-
tween 1997 and 2003. There is
great optimism among the writers

of the plan that if itis implemented,
it will bring about an economic
revival. There are those, however,
who question this theory. There is
a strong resistance to decentraliza-
tion both within and outside the
government. This resistance has
only been strengthened by a recent
boom in Japan’s economy.
However, analysts warn that
this recent economic growthis only
temporary and has been at the ex-
pense of the future. Increased taxes
and decreased tax rebates planned
for 1997 will slow economic gains.
And the gains of big business which
has been the major force behind
the recent growth has resulted al-
most exclusively from cost-cut-
ting. Saleshave remained thesame,
and firms have made profits sim-

ply by turning to cheaper foreign
suppliers and cutting corners in
production. These trends have re-
sulted in an average of 1,300
smaller firms going bankrupt each
month and an unemployment of
3.2 percent.

As Japan’s economic prob-

‘lems mount, the government is

desperately trying to find a way to
turn its economy around. The prob-
lem is that all its ideas so far have
only been quick fixes. Japan is
finally facing the economic prob-
lems that the United States faced
during the 70s and 80s. And like
the United States, Japan is turning
to those options which lead to a
quick fix for current problems
while creating even larger eco-
nomic problems down the road.

Colorado Tightens Rules on Student-Teacher Relationships

If professors at the University of Colorado want to date students
in their classes, they’ ll have to let their superiors know about it.

Colorado becomes the latest school to set up guidelines for
student-teacher relationships, hoping to avoid any liability in future | |
sexual harassment cases. The new policy covers the potential student
relationships of staff members as well.

“This is a way to protect the student, the professor, and the
school,” says University spokesperson Pauline Hale.
about moral judgements or forbidding relationships. It’s simply a way
to ensure that students are not taken advantage of.”

UC’s policy is similar to policies at other universities. Some
schools, such as UVa, have placed an outright ban on relationships
between professors and students in their classes. At Iowa, “amorous”
relationships between faculty mand students are forbidden when the
instructor has any direct responsibility to the student.

Other schools, like Vermont State College, have guidelines
spelling out the administration’s disapproval of student-teacher rela-
tionships, though there are no provisions that directly ban them.
