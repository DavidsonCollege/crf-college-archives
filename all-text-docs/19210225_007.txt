THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 25, 1921.

I came to Colgate.
They sold me

Two hymn books,

A chapel seat,

A radiator and
Shower bath space.
They took my check
And laughed at me.
But I fooled ’em—

I had no money

In the bank.

Second Class Matter, Anyhow.
Information from Mitchell College s<-
veals the fact that Horatorio Burney
writes such long letters he can’t get
them in an envelope, so he rolls them
up like a newspaper and sends them
for one cent. You can’t beat brains!

Fact?

The English IV students are rejoicing
over the latest addition, to the college
curriculum—the Eng. IV laboratory.

Huh?

There may be nothing new under the
sun, but what’s wrong with the idea of
anchoring the stray end of your watch
chain with a fish-line sinker?

Juniors Hold Forth.

Sanders looked to the Stare and Tufts
told of The Hidden Territery. While
Price tried to tame the Wildkittens, Mc-
llwaine illustrated The Amateur photog-
rapher. Cunningham tried to show he
was The Greatest Man in America, but
McGuikin went him one better since he
was The Greatest Man in the World.
Taylor, who discoursed on From the
Chin Up, was also bettered by Spencer,
who spoke on The Complete Man. Hor-
ton explained The Modern Dence and
Lowrance came in with The Final
Squeeze. While Bailey unwound his
Business Possibilities, Cornelson wound
up his Thread. Jones, who is still un-
married, contemplates Divorce, but R. H.
Shaw asks Who? Parks elucidated on
The Might of Little Things, such as if,
which was proposed by Nash. Richards
called us A Nation of Fools and Free-
man answered That is the Man! The
speeches were Caste into The Melting
Pot and McKeithen lamented over the
Fallen Idols. The Sixth Sense of Hanra-
han enabled him to have Bitzer’s Op-
timiem, but Doubles wanted to know
Why? and Curry asked What Next? Cly-
burn, however, was wise enough to Pre-
pare for the Crisie, and J. R. Jones call-
ed that Efficiency. Gosh! if it wasn't for
Ormond’s Creed of Courage what would
we do?
