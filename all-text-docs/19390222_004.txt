DAVIDSON SPORTS

Wed., Feb. 22, 1939

It seems as if Davidson's quintet will never get that ONE last
victory needed to clinch them a place in the Southern Conference play-
off ... They get their last chances this week against South Carolina,
Wake Forest, and Furman... Chances’ are pretty good against the
Gamecocks and Purple Hurricane, but those Deacons .. . Oh, Man! arya)
The highest scoring team in the Conference their is “a
point and a half per minute”... and they get them too... When
Waller and Owen get hot-—watch out!

Wake Forest fans declared that the Deacons played their best
game of the year against Davidson the other night . . . On the other
hand, Davidson probably played their worst ball of the season, which
accounts somewhat for the Baptists fine showing ... And if you
don’t believe that the Deacs have a flock of followers just ask
little Grey Hunter ... Also ask him of their attitude (maybe sports-
manship) ... Truly the Deacons have the best player in the Con-
ference (Waller) . .. but there are three or four more superlatives

motto

Bill Sweel, for instance is the most ag-
. Boyd Owen is as polished a
. He's equally
and he rates

present on the team...
gressive player in the conference . .
performer (all-around) as can be seen in the State . .
as good on the offensive as he is on the defensive .. .
second only to Waller in scoring . ..

The fur should fly when the ‘Cats and Deas tangle here Saturday
night... It will be Davidson's last attempt to stop the super-scorer
Waller... “Mighty Atom” Johnny
holding the Deac Captain to somewhere in the neighborhood of seven
to eight points ... If the tricky
Saturday night, and someone stops the ever-alert Owen, then the Wild-
cats will be in... PecHint tomthenwisenrs
better get there early and get a seat Before
too early! oe

While on the subject of Wake Forest... they’re-probably stick-
ing their necks out ... trying to schedule NOTRE DAME for a
football game in 1940 ... Why the Irish could hardly get one of their
busses (or do they travel by train) in Wake Forest . . . Imagine!
... Coach Gene McEver’s proteges are coming along fine with their
spring training program .

Tice did it his Sophomore year,
‘Cat speedster can repeat the trick
and in a big way too

you

supper wouldn't be

. . Some of those rising sophomores are
going to make it mighty tough on opposing teams next fall .. Big
Stan Yoder, Bill Shaw, Don Bell, Elmer Knoeller, Frank Caldwell
and John Strandwitz, not to mention about 15 or 20 others, ‘show
plenty of promise ... Then there are a number of men from the
Beester squad . Granville Sharpe, Jay Bolin, and the elusive
“Black Dog.” ... The return of Wilson “Tubby” Hand, who scats
like a scared rabbit, and Horace McCall, veteran center, helps
things considerably . .. And how about those returning lettermen.
+++ Yep, the Wildcats should how! louder than ever next year...
The familiar thud of a baseball plunking into a glove means that
America's favorite pastime, Basbell, is almost in season... Big league
teams are practically through their trading and buying . . . now all they
have to do is to get their aces to sign... and what a job that is...
At least they've already got Diz Dean, and Der Mag in the fold... You
know, half of this signing the contract business is just publicity any-
way ... It’s just like everything else ... . Wonder what Duke's “Little
Athletics” are going to have this year... Russ Bergman, who'll cer-
tainly go to the majors, is back at shortstop... “Crash” Davis, who
played with our own Tubby Hand and J. D. Hicks the Legion
Championship Gastonia team, will cover second base .. . Then, they say,
that this Price boy (you've seen him play basketball) has,some Cleveland
Indian strings attached to him because of his infield ability ... It seems
that he is also a shortstop, which means that Bergman will probably
be over on the, “hot corner”... Imagine trying to get a base hit through
a crew like that ... Bergman, Price and Davis... looks like the only
thing to do is to hit 'em over their heads,
HERE AND THERE ... South Carolina Gamecocks will miss
the services of Al Grygo, a sophomore back last year, that had mer-
cury in his heels during their coming football campaign . ... They
flunked him out . . « Belmont Abbey’s gridders will also be minus
the services of two stars next year ... Jumping Joe Cuffaro, who
plays a nice game of basketball too, and Ed Visnic, tackle supreme,
haven't been seen or heard of since the Christmas holidays... They'd
make some major college a good pair of warriors . . . both weigh
around the 200 pound mark... Graham McFayden is the only un-
defeated wrestler on the Davidson squad ... Ed Ellis, who had every
match before the V. P. I: meet, dropped his first to the Gobbler
grunter . . . Big Bill Johnston, Davidson's heavyweight, has saved
the ’Cat grapplers twice this year with pins... once against Duke
and the other last Saturday against V. P. I... . nice going Bill...
For the second straight year Baseball's silverbat went to a member
of Beckley (W. Va.) entry into the Mountain State league...
Murray Franklin, a shortstop, topped all batters
baseball with an average well over the 400 pct.
Martin, who resembles our own “Red” Laird, took top honors the
Previous year ... Marshall Goldberg wants 20,000 shekels to play
professional football next year... 10 to 1 he doesn’t get it’...

Famed last words—Remember, don’t boo at the game Saturday
night—not even at...

The “Rede” defeated the “Blacks”
to cap off a week of hard work in
winter football drills as three quart-

ed. The game was close from begin-

fine defensive work rather than
any outstanding offensive threats.

Stan Yoder was the big gun for
the losers with his powerful line-

of Marvin Pennington, veteran
guard, put a stop to many of the
“Reds” offensive thrusts.

The battle for positions on the
starting eleven has become more
bitter as the drills became more
intense. Horace McCall and “Poss”

sad weather and illness seem to
have combined the
Wildcat track squad, which to
compete in the annual Southern
Conference Indoor Games this week
end at Chapel Hill.

It learned last week that
Boo Walker, veteran distance man,
will definitely be unable to compete
in his specialty, the two mile run.
Loss of Walker will greatly cripple
Davidson in what was thought to
be her strongest department.

Charlie Sample, indoor champ in
the pole-vault last year, will be
able to defend his title, but it is
feared that loss of weight and prac-
tice due to a very recent illness will

greatly handicap his performance.
It is probable that he will compete
only in the .vault and will be
scratched from participation in the
sprints.

Rain Stops Practice

The original squad of thirteen will
have to be further cut, according
to Coach Whittle, because of ‘lack
of practice due to rain. The frosh
representation will be cut to three
men and perhaps twice that num-
ber will enter the varsity division,
Sampe, White, Woodward, Gam-
man, Black, and possibly McAlpine
if his bad ankle comes around, will
carry the Wildcats’ varsity hopes,
while Taylor, Williamson, and
Strandwitz will probably represent
the Frosh.

As usual the cream of the south's
trackmen will appear on the boards
of Carolina's new gym. Outstand-
ing among the veteran entrants are
Kehoe of Maryland, Strickler of
V. M. I1., Harvey of W. & L., Fuller
of Va., Winborne of Carolina, Mil-
ler of Maryland, and Sample and
Woodward of Davidson.

U.N.C. and Duke Favored

North Carolina and Duke will
probably again rule as team favor-
ites. Thesé two teams battled it
out last year, with the Blue Devils
gaining a close decision. Neither
team suffered greatly by gradua-
tion and both will bring back sey-
eral of last year’s champs.

In addition to conference entries,
