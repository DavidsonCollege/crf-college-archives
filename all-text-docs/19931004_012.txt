Nirvana's latest, In Utero, marks retreat from MTV

I was thinking all week about
how I could discuss Nirvana’s new
album, Jn Utero, without mention-
ing their earth-shattering major
label debut Nevermind. After all,
Nirvana and Nevermind are one
and the same to all but a few brave
souls who bought their early al-
bum Bleach and their outtake col-
lection Insecticide. To neglect the
ubiquitous album of the 1990’s
and the envy of over-the-hill rock
stars everywhere would be as easy
as Starting an interview with the
Village People by saying, “Let’s
not talk about your disco years...”

Listening to Jn Utero makes
me realize what a good album
Nevermind is. The catch is that I
like both. Nevermind stood out
because of the consistent and sym-
pathetic production of Butch Vig,
who helped them-sound live and

loud without burying the pop hooks
that helped. them seize control of
the FM dial for most of 1992.

In Utero is neither as consis-
tent nor as catchy. The best single

i Tom

example of the band’s unwilling-
ness to make another collection
full of pop nuggets is the fourth
song on the album. It begins, and
continues throughout, with a vir-
tual carbon copy of the “Smells
Like Teen Spirit” guitar riff. Num-
ber one with a bullet, right? The
greed-induced tears of the record
company executives probably
started flowing about 10 seconds
in, when Kurt Cobain opened his

big mouth: “Rape me, my friend,
rape me again.”

The other eleven songs on the
album find different ways of avoid-
ing the radio appeal of “Lithium”
or “Teen Spirit.” Some are like
“Rape Me,” with lyrics meant to
weed out the faint of heart: “Every
wet nurse refused to feed him; elec-
trolytes smell like semen.” Others
have so much distorted screaming
and writhing that people looking
for another song like “Come As
You Are” will do a lot of fast
forwarding. Feedback and studio
chatter is abundant— my favorite
‘is the beginning of the loudest song
onthealbum, “tourette’s,” in which
bassist Chris Novoselic says in a
game show-host voice over guitar
feedback, “Moderate rock!”

It’s fairly obvious that Nir-
vana is trying to distance’ itself

Author Tim McLaurin to speak at DC

By Rachel Newcomb

The New York Times has de-
scribed Tim McLaurin as a writer
who “has real talent. He is a mov-
ing writer— never cute, nor overly
colloquial—and his prose has a
lyrical clarity that conveys with
unusual dignity the integrity of his
ownexperience.” This North Caro-
lina writer will appear in the 900
room on Tuesday, October 5, at
7:30 p.m. A Chapel Hill resident,
McLaurin was raised ina family of
six children near Fayetteville,

North Carolina. In 1985, he re-
ceived his B.A. in Journalism from
the University of North Carolina.
He has served in both the Marines
and the Peace Corps in Tunisia and
is married to Katie Oliver Early,
Davidson Class of 1974.

In 1988, McLaurin published
his first novel, The Acorn Plan,
and Woodrow’s Trumpet followed
in 1989. His most recent book,
Keeper of the Moon, chronicles his
life, from his childhood in
Fayetteville to.his debilitating

battle with myeloma, a rare form
of bone cancer. Keeper of the
Moon has received critical praise
as well as The Mayflower Award
of the North Carolina Literary and
Historical Societies for best non-
fiction work of 1991.

On Tuesday afternoon,
McLaurin will also autograph
books at Main Street Books in
Davidson. McLaurin’s third novel,
Cured by Fire, willbe published in
the spring of 1994.

Vegetarianism benefits more than health

Vegies continued from page 11

| There are even more health
benefits of a vegetarian diet. A
vegetarian diet tends to be much
ower in fat and calories. Because
ithe diet is lower in fat, the diges-
tive system is able to break down
the food much faster. Fruits and
vegetables take 20 minutes tocom-
pletely digest, while a steak can
take up to 12 hours. The faster
food digests, the more energy your
body has for other things. This is
why you may hear vegetarians
claim that they have so much en-
ergy, and this is also why you may
hear someone who has just fin-
ished a big steak say that he or she
feels tired.

But what about protein? You
have probably had your mother
lecture you at some point on the
dangers of not getting enough pro-
tein. It has long been a common
myth that vegetarians do not get
enough protein. That rumor is
completely untrue. According to
Nathan Pritkin, an expert on nutri-
tion, it is almost impossible not to
get enough protein when eating a
diet sufficient in calories. Only six
percent of daily calories need to
come from protein, and it is virtu-
ally impossible to get below nine
percent.

Actually, the biggest protein
problem lies in getting too much
protein. An excess of protein de-

pletes the bones of calcium. This _.

can lead to osteoporosis, a disease
which causes a “hunchback” ap-
pearance and affects 25% of
women over 65 in the U.S. This

disease is non-existent among veg-
etarian women.

Junior Nat May defines an-
other reason not to eat meat: the
plight of the animals. He says he
has been a vegetarian since 1991
because, “I don’t think meat is
good for me, I don’t like the way
the animals are treated, andI don’t
think itis a good use of resources.”

Most of the meat that we con-
sume today has been obtained from
animals that have been badly mis-
treated. The image of the happy
cow that lives on a spacious farm
until she becomes dinner is no
longer an accurate picture. Today’s
cows, pigs, and chickens live in
factories until the time of slaugh-
ter. The animals are injected with
numerous hormones to fatten them
up so that the process can be accel-
erated. When the animals are
slaughtered, it is often in an inhu-
mane manner.

Another major reason for ab-

staining from meat comes from an
economical and ecological per-
spective. Seventy percent of our
nation’s grain is fed to the animals
that we eat. David Pimentel, a
Cornell University professor, esti-
mates that converting back to a
natural grass-feed system for live-
stock would allow thirty million
more tons of grain to be used for
direct human consumption, enough
to feed over 400 million people.
Millions of people in third world
countries die of starvation every
year, while millions of Americans
die of health-related diseases.

So, before you ask a vegetar-
ian if they would not rather “enjoy
their lives and die younger” than
“eat nuts and twigs and die old,” be
aware that vegetarians do eat well
and do enjoy their lives. Choosing.
to be a vegetarian does not mean
that you have to giveup happiness;
for many, it just means being hap-
pier about a lifestyle choice.

Country and democracy

Dixie continued from page 11

different matter. We don’t needa
president. We don’t need an elec-
tion. We don’tneed to know who’s
the best. I don’t want my heroes
out there campaigning for reelec-
tion. I want them in the studio and
on the stage. I want them pure and
unstained. If the Country Music
Association needs to have an

awards show, why recognize the

“best” performers? Who’s to say
who should be up there? Why not
recognize something concrete and

commendable?

Whatabout the Tennessee boy
who played thehonky tonks forten
years and just hit the big time?
What about the Kentucky girl
who’s still cutting albums after
forty years? What about the fan
who drove a thousand miles to see
his hero play? This is Country. I
‘don’t care who sold the most al-
bums or packed the biggest sta-
dium.

Call me an idealist. Call me
naive. I don’t care. Just keep the
contests out of my Country music.

from the increasingly polished and
pathetic Seattle myth that MTV
and the press have given them un-
due credit for starting. “Our favor-
ite patient, display of patience, dis-
ease-covered Puget Sound” is one
ofthe most clearly enunciated lines
of “Frances Farmer Will Have Her
Revenge On Seattle.” Cobain,
Novoselic, and drummer Dave
Grohl have made themselves out
to be the Charles Barkley's of rock-
n-roll, enormously popular with
teenagers and feeling intense pres-
sure to turn themselves into G-
rated, M.C. Hammer-like role
models. They have stayed true to
themselves to the chagrin of many.

's Seattle sound

If anything, In Utero reflects
the two greatest events in head
songwriter Cobain’s life: the birth
of his son and his explosion into
stardom. The songs, which recall
the raunchier days of 1989’s
Bleach, are simultaneously child-
ish and wise (“I miss the comfort
in being sad”). Nirvana talks like
Beavis and Butthead—“If you ever
need anything, don’t hesitate to
ask someone else first” — but you
can tellthey are notsodumb. They
have experienced the roller-coaster
ride of becoming a corporate prod-
uct and poster boys for a so-called
“Lost Generation”— and have
come out screaming like newborns.

Movie Review

"The Good Son" just isn't

By Scott McLean

O, ‘bestill my beating heart!
O, woe is me! O, this the season of
my malcontent! Roll of thunder
hear my cry! I am beginning to
think that I have been cursed -
doomed forever to watch crappy
movies for the pleasure of David-
sonian readers everywhere. Well,
at least I don’t have to pay to see a
flick anymore sol guess that is one
good thing that has come out of all
this. Anyway, the latest in the
string of stinkers to arrive from
Hollywood is “The Good Son,”
starring that “Home Alone”
wonderkid Macaulay Culkin. Yet
another variation on the 50’sthriller
“The Bad Seed,” this version fea-
tures little Mac as a psychotic
grade-schooler who’s pulled the
wool over everyone’s eyes with
his “good son” act.

While Culkin shines in a
couple ofscenes, he fails to click in
the role and what has the potential
for a great thriller spirals down
into disaster. As an acquaintance
of mine would say, ““The Good
Son’ was baaad.”

Here’s the scenario: After the
death of his mother, Mark (Elijah
Wood) is taken by his father to stay
with Mark’s uncle and his family
which includes cousin Henry

(Culkin). Mark and Henry be-
come buddies and every day they
run amok all over the town where
Henry lives, playing with his “toys”
which include a device that shoots
metal bolts and a life-size dummy
called affectionately by the name
“Mr. Highwayman” (guess why).
Despite this rather damning evi-
dence, it takes Mark at least half
way through the film to discover
that Henry is unstable and danger-
ous. The movie then dives head-
long into what some may call sus-
pense, but what I call ludicrous and
laughable.

It is admirable for Macauley
to go out on a limb here to demon-
Strate his versatility as an actor,
and it is ashame that it just doesn’t
seem to work out for him. How-
ever, the whole project is not a
total waste— it is somewhat enter-
taining to laugh at some of the
more colorful lines and sequences
in the film (e.g. Culkin’s infamous
“Don’t f— with me” retort is a
riot). But as we all know, a few
good scenes does not a fine flick
make. For you curious folk out
there who are just dying to see a
Mac gone bad, be my guests. As
forme, I’drather stay “homealone”
(O.K., this was bad, but y’all knew
it was coming sometime).
