Complaints about the quality
of the laundry service dealt with

shrinkage, staining, bleaching,

lost clothing and missing but-

‘straighten out” these prob-
lems “right away.’

‘‘We feel that the majority of .
students recéive a satisfactory .

service at a satisfactory price.”

This year’s $200 fee was up

Libertarian Party on the rise in 50 states

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer ,

Three North Carolina Liber-
tarian Party candidates appear-
ed before a small group of
students in the 900 Room
Sunday afternoon.

The election forum, sponsor-
ed by the Davidson College
Libertarian Party, included
Rick Pasotto, candidate for the
U.S. Senate, Bobby Emory,
candidate for Governor of North
Carolina and Craig Franklin,
candidate for state Lieutenant
Governor.

The speakers stressed major
issues of concern to Davidson
Libertarians.

Franklin defined a Libertar-

_ jan as ‘‘someone who is liberal
‘with your freedom but conserv-
‘ative’ with your money.”’

‘We believe the govern-

“inent’s role is to protect individ-

ual rights rather than to impose
any sort of equality,” Franklin
said.

He also emphasized the par-
ty’s commitment to the passage
of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment by the North Carolina
legislature.

Synco

“‘ERA is the only way of

' implementing equal rights ‘to-

day. Out of 34 states needed to
ratify the amendment 31 have
already done so. North Carolina
is unfortunately not among
them. If we could push it
through this year it could break
the psychological log jam in
other states. It only lost in the
Senate by two votes in 1978.”

Pasotto voiced opposition to
a revival of the draft.

“A draft is nothing more than
involuntary servitude. It’s sla-
very, to put it bluntly. For
manpower the military should
stick to the volunteer system.”

When asked if such a stipula-
tion would interfere with U.S.
military capability, Pasotto res-
ponded that ‘‘any war. today
would be fought on technologic-
al grounds rather than on the
basis of sheer number of
troops.”’

Both Franklin and Pasotto
conceded that they had little
chance of winning this election,
yet each felt certain of future
success given continued party
growth.

“Roger MacBride, the Liber-

tarian candidate for President
in 1976, only polled around
275,000 votes. We estimate that
Ed Clark, our candidate this
year, will receive somewhere
around two million votes,”’ said

-Frankdin.

Pasotto said he expected a
Libertarian to be elected to
Congress by 1982.

Franklin was even more opto-

“Two years ago most people
didn’t know what a Libertarian
was. We’re making extraordi-
nary gains now, especially on
college campuses. People recog-
nize us.””

“We're organized in all fifty
states and we’re on the ballot in
all states, the District of Colum-
bia, and Guam. This is the first
time a third party has managed
that since 1916.”

“Given the continued growth
of the party and the weakness of
the Democrats and Republi-
cans, we should be a major
political force in the nation by
the middle of the decade. I
anticipate that we will have a
man in the White House by
1996,”’ Franklin said.

wide. Synco wants to keep one cul-de-sac
narrower, Project Officer Donald Cheek
said, to prevent its becoming a ‘‘race-
way.” Any request for variance must
receive approval from the Building
Inspector, MacCormac said.

—The limited capacity of the sewer
line which would pick up the develop-
ment’s sewage. The line can now handle
only 20 additional homes. Expanding
the line, MacCormac said, would cost
“upwards from $175,000.”

A further complication, MacCormac
said, is that Davidson has a committ-
ment to tie into the Charlotte-Mecklen-
burg Utility Departments (CMUD)

county-wide sewage facility on Mac- .

Dowell Creek, south of Huntersville. The
McDowell Creek plant is completed and
in operation, but negotiations are still
pending between Charlotte and the
towns fo northern Mecklenburg County
regarding the control and rate structure

of the town sewer systems. A decision as.’

to whether CMUD or Davidson will
control Davidson’s sewer system will
“establish responsibility” for the sys-
tem, MacCormac said, and clarify who
should pay for alterations. MacCormac
said: she hopes for a resolution of the
negotiations by this winter.

Because of the sewer lines limitations,
however, Synco cannot build more than
20 homes until the sewer line is
expanded.

—The housing project's density. The
Synco plans call for a project density of
4.3 home units per acre for the entire
development of 150 units, Yelverton

said. The area is presently zoned.

commercial, with a maximum density of
3.87 unite.

While the proposed density is highsr

than that allowed by the zoning law, :

Moreover, the special use permit. allows
a density of up to 12 units per acre.

—The impact of the development on
the lake anc on town services. One of the
chief tasks of the ad hoc committee will
be to determine the town’s. legal stand-
ing with respect to water use and
membership in the Synco development’s
- Homeowner's Association.

The Synco development would be on a
small 400 acre lake separated from Lake

Norman. Synco’s plan calls for the
construction of 72 boat slips and a boat
ramp with the 150 units.

The lake is ‘‘not large enough to
handle power boats’’ from 150 units,
Yelverton wrote in a letter to the Oct. 9
issue of The Mecklenburg Gazette. ‘‘We
would be supportive of any movement to
limit horsepower or eliminate motors
altogether on the lake,’’ Yelverton
added.

Although the lake falls within David-
son town limits, it is unclear whether the
town has jurisdiction to set rules for use
of the lake. ‘‘We don’t know what the
town can do with respect to water use,”
Town Attorney and ad hoc committee
member Richard, Kline said.

In addition, the Synco proposal calls
for the establishment of a Homeowner’s
Association in the project to legislate
private restrictions within the develop-
ment, such as lake access and road use.

If Davidson, as owner of the roads.

within the project, were to’ become a
partner in this association, Kline said,
the town'could help enforce restrictions.
“It could be advantageous both for the
town and for the residents,” Kline said,
‘‘but it’s never been done in North
Carolina.”

In addition to Kline, the ad hoc

committee will consist of Town Board

members William Ward and William

. Mayhew and Planning Board Chairper-

son Annamarie Burts.

The Planning Board also called for a
complete review of th Special Use permit
ordinance once a final decision is made
on the Synco proposal. Yelverton said he
expects the revisions to lead to better

coordination between the Special permit .
and other regulations, such as subdivi-

sion ordinances. -

‘The:'Town Board's decision did: not.
i surprise Yelverton::‘I'was hoping they’d
- accept the Planning Board's: recommén- a

dation ‘]to issue a permit immediately),””

Yelverton said, “but its a big decision

for the town to make.”

‘Yelverton said Synco hopes to begin
construction ‘‘as soon as possible...we’d
hoped it-would be before the end of the
year.”” The company would first build
the 20 units possible with the’ present
sewer line, and then ‘‘as sewer becomes
available we can proceed.” Yelverton

‘said Synco had not discussed whether

they would be willing to help finance the
sewer line expansion if requested.

In addition to the 35 acres adjacent to
Griffith Street, Synco also owns the
penninsula on Lake Norman on the other
side of I-77. Yelverton said Synco has
‘‘no definite plans’’ for this land.
Construction of additional: housing
would depend on the market situation,
hesaid. While this pennisula is outside of
Davidson town limits, Yelverton added,
town zoning laws still apply within one
mile of the limits. Moreover, if Synco did
build a project on this land,it might be
annexed to the town. ‘“‘It would certainly
be in Davidson’s interest.”” Yelverton
‘said, ‘‘to increase its tax base.”

Library Director Leland Park criti-
cized the Synco proposal in a letter to
The Mecklenburg Gazette (Oct. 9) and at
the Town Board meeting Tuesday.
Park said he is concerned about the
extent, fairness, and speed of the
development.

Building more than 150, or as many as
900 units, Park said, would raise the
population of Davidson “two or three
fold.” Such a change would have drastic
effects in town politics, for example.
Wit’. such a large population the area
could.‘‘eentrol the destiny of the town of
Davidson.” . -

Park was also concerned about Syn-
co’s requests for variances from the town
zoning laws. In such a potentially large
project, he said, the “standards that you
set initially should be the same through-
out. You don’t want exceptions to the
rule {from the outset].’’

Finally, Park said, he is concerned
about ‘the preservation of Davidson's

‘sense of community. This town assimu-

-Iates, new people,” he told the Town
- Board, “but 4 large number of people

coming into the town in a short, amount
of tithe cannot be assimulated.” _.
‘Yelverton atgued that development

will be “very gradual,” with the first 150 —

units appearing in ‘three to five years.”
Park also said the new housing will

‘not be useful to Davidson College

faculty. The cost of the houses, from $75
-100,000, is prohibitive to most profes-
sors, who need housing in the $45-60,000
range, Park said.

Davidson College does have a stake in
the Synco development, however. The
College has “about $25,000’ worth of

shares in the Lake Norman Company,
according to Business Manager Robert
Currie. The Lake Norman Company
owns the land in question.

Synco acts in an ‘‘advisory and
managerial capacity for the Lake Nor-
man Company,” Yelverton said.

Davidson College invested in Lake
Norman, Currie explained, because Col-
lege President Samuel Spencer and
Trustees felt that Synco understood the
College’s interest in the town’s develop-
ment. ‘Davidson is going to grow,”
Currie said, ‘‘the question is how can you
encourage the best type of growth?”

Many of those working at Synco,
including its President, Reitzel Snider
"57, are Davidson alumni, Yelverton
noted.

North Carolina Waterskiing School
owner Russ Debuc expressed a different
concern at the Town Board meeting.
Debuc is afraid the Synco development
will ruin his livelihood.

For three years Debuc has taught
waterskiing on the lake. His site is now
used by both the Davidson College and
Central Piedmont Community College
waterski programs. Debuc has also
hosted two intercollegiate- regional tour-
naments.

“When I heard there would be 72 boat
slips on the lake, of course I had a heart
attack,’’ Debuc said, ‘““That lake cannot
support 72 power boats at one time.”’

Any limitation on horsepower on the
lake would ruin Debuc’s business, he
said. Debuc also cited the safety hazards
involved in overcrowded lakes.

Debuc’s site is the “‘best in the state,”’
according to sophomore Lee McCormick,
Secretary-Treasurer of the Ski Club.
McCormick said the loss of the site
would be a severe blow to Davidson's

waterskiing program, which involves
about 70 students, including ‘15 or 20

- hard-core serious skiiers.’’

The Synco development would ‘‘cer-
tainly upgrade the general area,” Park
said. The Town Board is being ‘‘very
deliberative,’’ he added, ‘‘and that’ 8 all

that we ask.”

The town has ‘ ‘no interest in delaying
Synco,”” MacCormac said, but the pace
of the project will depend on ‘‘how
complex the legal issue is.’’

“It’s a time-consuming process,”’
Yelverton said, ‘‘we understand that.’’
