OPINIONS

MONDAY, APRIL 28, 1997

*Eight years ago the world drasti-
cally changed with a symbolic fall
of a graffiti-littered wall.

¢Fifty-two years ago America lit-
tered the Japanese countryside with
the first use of nuclear warfare.

eOne hundred years ago the USA
was just pulling out of a devastating
four year depression.

For those of us walking across
the stage in three weeks, looking
back at history hardly seems rel-
evant, necessary, or worth our en-
ergy. Most of our extra time is
spent fantasizing about the pros-
pects of the future, not looking back
at how far we’ve come(excluding
all 1997 graduates unemployed af-
ter May 18 who don’t fantasize, but
worry). Besides, we barely even
have enough motivation to finish
those last journal entries, start re-
search for that seminar paper, or
open books imperative for receiv-
ing a diploma.

Why should we?

Ashley Gribble

The Senior Slump

How does a depression, long
forgotten in the wake of the “Great”
one of 1929, really have anything to

‘do with us?

We take who we are and where
we are now — for granted. A hun-
dred years ago, most teenagers never
even imagined attending an institu-
tion like Davidson College. Back
then, families barely survived dur-
ing economic devastation. In 1897,
the last thing average eighteenyear-
olds thought about was choosing
between institutions of higher edu-
cation.

Oh, things have changed. In-
flation. Computers. Equal Rights.
So much can happen in four years.
Butafter Davidson’s abnormal four-
year-plan, our large effort still seems
unrepresented on paper. We think
we could have gone to a cheaper
state school for a better academic
batting average and a more diverse
experience.

Beside the citizens of Charlotte
who think “Wow. She must be
smart,” when I drop the Davidson
name, no one even has a clue of

Davidson’s caliber. [know it stands.
Then why do I still feel shock and
miserable failure when I look at my
resume, which excludes any GPA
for protective purposes? How can I
explain to prospective employers
that my “D” in Calculus is
comparible to a “C+” at UNC and
have them keep a'straight face?

Then there’s the job question. I
can almost hear the universal “so
what.are you going to be doing next
year” in my sleep. It’s April, and I
still fumble for a vague response.
When I wait restlessly by the phone
hoping that my ONE interview will
come through, I brood over stories
of economics majors who have an
inkling of where they will be in
August (and a five digit salary to
boot), while History majors like
myself grapple with the upcoming
unknown.

In those times, I feel like
Davidson let me down. It’s so easy
to feel like that.

However, I am walking across
that stage in May with something
mostof my high school friends won’t

see for another year. But a piece of
paper freeing my father from all
financial ties to this school is the
smallest reward for sticking around.
I’m not sitting out in the May sun
for three hours for just a piece of
paper. My parents are not flying all
the way from. England for just an
“early finish.” I will leave with so
much more than that.

This is NOT Davidson Com-
munity College. My Davidson has
given me a four year challenge, a
promising future (although unseen
at this point), and an unquenchable
pride for what I will have accom-
plished. I tend to forget that I took
a chance on Davidson College. I
didn’t transfer. Did you?

So I sit here in Building F
anticipating the next three weeks
with fear and sadness. That shows,
at least, how much Davidson has
done for me, no matter what the
numbers say. We complain about
the work load, the tuition, and the
things we’ve missed out on. In
fact, we just complain, period. Our
individual families have contrib-

uted almost a tenth of a million
dollars to this institution. But when
have we ever stopped to think about
how much WE owe Davidson Col-
lege?

Here we are, standing at the
edge of the unknown, the “Real
World,”: and yet all we can think
about is ourselves. We desperatly
want to leave the extreme pressure
behind, no looking-back. “T’ ve given
so much money and time to
Davidson. I don’t owe it anything,”
we say. But we do. It’s not about
jobs — or grad school. A Davidson
mother answers her faltering
offspring’s questions about educa-
tional worth versus sanity with:
“This is the only thing in your life
that is ALL YOURS.”

I would be lying if I said that my
roller-coaster college years haven’ t
left'me queasy. Life at Davidson
hasn’t been hopscotch simple. But
it’s the ride I got on, and I’m getting
off in May standing on two feet.
That’s so much to be thankful for.

Remember that when you hear
from the annual fund.

I’m Just Stating My Opinion

Let me start off by saying that
I was disgruntled by the way my
article was taken by Kruse and
Bradshaw last week. Bradshaw,
failed to figure out our point. Allow
me to reiterate it in simple terms.
We were not pleased with the way
Marshall Tyler was portrayed in a
baseball article two weeks ago. This
was our opinion.:

Bradshaw stated that he real-
ized that “writing with indifference
may be damaging to sports cover-
age here.” He said he was not
influenced by our thoughtless and
angst-ridden articles. Rather, he
was influenced by others who had
approached him in more “thought-
ful” and less angry ways making
him reconsider how the sports page
is written. Is this another case of not
giving credit where credit is due, a
reoccurring theme with the smug,
unhappy Davidson sports writers.
I have in the past two weeks re-
ceived several compliments about
my “angry and bitching” article and
have had several people agree with
me, not about Kruse’s article, but
rather the sports writing in general.
People don’t like the way the sports
section is written, whether it is cov-
erage of their team or lack thereof.
I’m not saying that I can do better,
just “‘stating the facts.”

Kruse responded to the articles
in a less than open-minded way.
Rather than taking our articles,
which are opinions, as constructive
criticism he chose to defend his

instead. I would like to take the:

defensive and rebut his rebuttal.
First, you can’t compare the heroics
of Jackie Robinson and the heroics
of Marshall Tyler. Secondly, it
. should not be about the “‘ability to
play sports and the ability to write
about them” but rather, the ability
to write about sports and to write
about them well. By “well” I mean
_ objectively (stating the facts), but

also covering all sports equally (not
just men’s hoops) and appealing to
one’s audiencé (Davidson Students).
Third, if Kruse really appreciates
the time and effort athletes put into
their sports, then why dog them if
they have a bad game or are in a
slump? According to his self-de-
scription, he has not been running
an 8K on the cross country trails,
practicing freethrows, taking bat-
ting practice, or swimming a 2000
meter warm up. That was what I
meant when I said time and effort.
Finally, I am not asking for sen-
tences like, “Despite the Wildcats
12-1 loss to App. St., they still did
good.” First, because it is not gram-
matically correct and secondly it
isn’t nice to patronize people. I am
just suggesting that you think about
to whom and for whom you are
writing.Will seems to think that
being referred to as a “backup”
goalie is not demeaning to Tyler.
I’m sure Bradshaw and Kruse and
all others who devote countless
hours and take pride in their work
(whatever it may be, a play, a sport,
an article or virtually anything)
would be offended when referred
to as a backup. Even though Tyler
was a backup or not even offended,
it is irrelevant and the same idea
could be portrayed in other ways.
I think your response to my
article could have been a little dif-
ferent also. A simple note from the
editor in the next issue stating that
no harm or disrespect was meant.
Or, you could have taken the Tripp
Franklin approach of leaving a 30
second voice mail explaining the
same and we all could have gone
home and gotten some sleep. From

this article I would only hope that |

any writer for The Davidsonian
would think about not only what is
true and relevant, but also the sub-
ject and audience of their article.
This is only my opinion.

__ “And now the end is near, and
so I face the final curtain. My
friend, I’ ll say it clear, I'll state my
case, of which I’m certain. I’ve
lived a life that’s full, I travelled
eachandevery highway. And more,
much more than this, I did it my
way.”

As I leave college for the great
and mysterious afterlife, I’d like to
be able to sing “My Way” with
Sinatra, Chairman of the Board that
he is. If I’m not mistaken about
who I am, I can.

I’ve always been a big believer
in doing my own thing, but I never
actually did it fully until this school
year. Before then, college was never
a whole lot of fun for me. I whined
too much, moped too much, and
worried about what people thought
of me.This year, though, things
changed because I decided that
laughter and fun were too damned
important to disregard, and that I
didn’t give a plying puck about
what people thought of me.

One of the most fun things for
me has been writing my weekly
column. I originally did it on a lark
back in the days of the great Paki-
stani conflict, when the Opinions
section needed lightening up more
than IVCF does.I got a tremendous
positive response and decided to
try my hand at another article the
next week. Again, y’all ate it up,
and I got hooked on making people
laugh and argue and discuss the
mildly controversial issues thatI’ ve
rambled about.

If you have a sense of humor,
use it and write for the Opinions
section. The newspaper needs a
satirist, a comedian to counterbal-
ance all of the silly articles written
by people whoare full of misguided
rage. Even if you’ve never written
anything funny, try your hand at it.

Hell, I’d rather..see .a page. filled

Greg Garrison

Why You Should Be Like Me— By Being Yourself

with poorly-written but mildly
funny articles than a page covered

« with bitter ones about trustees’ reli-
gious beliefs, veterans, [VCF’s char-
ter, the crosses, multiculturalism,
sensitivity, sororities, editorial ob-
jectivity, and Michael Kruse’s
sportswriting abilities all wrapped
together into an issue which is su-
per-hot for Davidson’s standards
and therefore dull as far as every-
body who’s not personally related
to the controversy is concerned.

I’m not the only person’ who
feels this way. Ask anyone if he or
she would rather read an article by
a Walt Barron-Britton Taylor-Greg
Garrison-type or an angry diatribe
about a mostly-irrelevant-to-ninety-
percent-of-the-school “issue.”

Don’t be afraid to be yourself,
and don’t be afraid to step on
people’s toes. Everyone has an axe
to grind, a cross to bear, or a cliche
to wear out, and you can never write
aword without hurting somebody’s
feelings. Instead of trying to be
sensitive and objective, be honest
and subjective. Every single word
ever written by a human being has
been written from a certain per-
spective, and the best thing that you
can do is to embrace your perspec-
tive and let people know where
you’re coming from.

Don’t take anything too seri-
ously, especially yourself. If you’re
a satirist, nothing is sacred, even
your own attitudes, beliefs, and
weaknesses. Don’t wimp out, wa-
ter down your cynicism, or try to
prove a point with facts and geo-
metric logic. That only makes you
look like an ass.

If you’re a satirist, you'll look
like an ass too, because you are one.
Although you’re making fun of
people who open themselves to
mockery, you are ultimately the big

_ jokes and itis you, notthesety

you satirize, that makes people
laugh.

As you write, feed yourself
with laughter, corn dogs, and beer.
If you don’t eat pork, don’t worry;
there are plenty of all-beef corn
dogs out there, and if I had the
money, I’d always buy the quite
expensive all-beef Hebrew Na-
tional Kosher dogs, because they’ re |,
the best you can buy at the grocery
store. Anyway, you should eat
corn dogs simply because they’re
so stinking good, but if you have to
ask me to tell you why to indulge in
the other two, you need to see a
therapist, not write a humor col-
umn.

Now, you may be complain-
ing at this point that I’m not being
funny at all. You’re correct, but I
honestly couldn’t figure out a way
to convey my feelings about this
subject without being serious.

Humor is one of the most im-
portant things in my life, and even
if you’re a funny person who hap-
pens to be a big wuss and youdon’t
even try your hand at The
Davidsonian, try your hand at
something. If you’re a typical stu-
dent around here, you really needa]
good laugh, and so do your friends.

I’msureI’llend my Davidson
career sounding arrogant for say-
ing that you should follow in my
footsteps, but I really don’t mind,
because I’m right.

In “Barometer Soup,” Jimmy
Buffett sings, “NoI’ mnot the first/
Won’t be the last/You lust for the
future/But treasure the past/Fol-
low in my wake, you’ve not that
much at stake/For I have plowed
the seas and smoothed the troubled
waters/Come along let’s have some
fun, the hard work has been done/
We'll barrel roll into the sun, just
for starters.”
