Tucker Cites ‘Viridiana’

As Cynical, Offensive

BY PROF. DONALD W. TUCKER
Spanish Department

The original interest which brought Viridiana to the
campus was linguistic. A few students wanted to see a
Spanish-language film.

Subsequently the prospect of
a prize-winning movie fomented
enthusiasm. Amidst Internation-
al acclaim and local furor Viri-
diana has come and gone. In
retrospect one suspects that al-
most. any other. Spanish film
would have contributed.as much
to our educational program as
did this one.

is neither. new nor Welcome.
Senor Bunuel has succeeded in
offending the. Spanish hierar-
chy, but one wonders what, if
anything. else he has accom-
plished with his. disgusting
iconoclasm and repulsive Freud-
ianism. In. spite of those many
elements which grate the sen-|
sitivity and distract the spirit of
the viewer. the superficial
banality of Bunuél’s ‘master.
picce’’ stands exposed. The tech-
nical.effects of the movie may
be commendable. but dramatic
genius is not the product of
stagecraft. |

Perfect Structure, Balance! Mctitresh Heads

BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic
It is difficult to see why there was ever any question
about bringing Viridiana to Davidson; it is not difficult
to see why the director has been banned from Franco’s
Spain for making it. In any case, the Union Film Com-
mittee deserves a medal for getting it here.

It would be impossible to sum
up the movie, Perhaps it might
be enlightening to compare and

drunken revel, a living Goya
drawing of degeneracy and al-
most unwatchable grossness,
to the ironic strains of the
Halleluja Chorus.

This was a stroke of genius.

L ‘Aventura—for it makes a
point that is in part akin to

general format. Yet it is far di€-
ferent. It makes. its point with

superfluous, nothing is padded;
the movie plunges into its fable
with no introductions, and never
lags.

ciples that are lepers, dwarfs,
prostitutes, cripples and. half-
wits surrounding Christ, a
coarse, toad-eyed blind man,
who in a burst of infantile rage
rises up to smash with his cane
the sacraments on the table.

It aims at more basic things
that the other two films—
whereas they were concerned
primarily with morals, Viri-
diana is concerned with the
conscience of a nation, and.
the problem of goodness and
mercy being twisted by reali-
ty. If achieves its effects
through a technique which
blends poetry with perversion
and- ugliness, filmed in a Go-
thic atmosphere which lends
it an element of starkness, a
sort of timeless gloom.

Viridiana is one of the rarest
artistic efforts, a work of per-
fect. structure and _ balance;
there is not an excess foot of
film in it. And it is a movie
that keeps saying things long
after the eye has moved on. In
short, it is a great film. Period.

Mission Director
Vespers Speaker

Vespers speaker for this Sun-
day is Paul S. Crane of the
Class of 1941. Dr. Crane js di-
rector of the Presbyterian Medi-
cal Mission in ‘Chunju, Korea.
At the present time, he is do-
ing post-graduate work in the
field of open-hzart surgery at
Johns Hopkins University.

What is ineredible about the

movie 4s its really. powerful in+

dictment of the Catholie Church
and. the Spanish way of life.
Whilé 1 am not qualified to say
anything about the political im-
plications of the film, suffice
it to mention that it. almost
seems unbelievable to except
the fact. that the story is set
in mbdern, contemporary: Spain.
Only the occastonal appearances, Working in Korea during the
Chinese invasion, Dr. Crane was
associated with the Army Medi-
cal Corps, and left the Army
with the rank of major. He is

on the Board of Trustees of

er any hint that he is not see-
ing a medieval world.

Rarely has the sordidness and
foolishness of the Church been
so openly exposed. Yet this ex-
posure has a wistfulness to it,
a sadness that things are the
way they are.

The movie is so rich in
scenes and characters, its ac-
tors so uniformly fine, that
it is hard ta single-out any
one item to praise above all
others. But one scene must
surely rank among the most
biting and arresting ever
filmed—the scene where the

Richardson have a_ good-sized
‘bibliography to back them up.

What this annual seems to

prove is that the scholarly ap-
proach does not make for live-
ly readifig. We must congratu-
late ‘Edifor Rob Abernethy,
however; on his choice of a
significant and serious theme
and on his thorough execution
of it. Hopefully, future edi-
tors will follow the path that
he and Charles Rose have pio-
neered.

As for the question of meth-
od, doesn't this probing of so-
ciety lie within the realm of the
artist as well as of the scholar?
Perhaps the workshop of the
artist, with all his tools of
prose, poetry, and. the pictoral
arts and with all his colorful
‘and deeply penetrating tech-
niques, is the proper place to
produce an annual which is
readable as well as serious.
