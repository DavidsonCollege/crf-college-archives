All That

“The Student” rested his rump on the grandstand
seat. His date sat beside him, her arm in his, her warmth
distracting.

“Dern”, he thought. sneering at convention, “Why
do we have to come to this ball game when we could
be out at the river lying on a blanket instead of sit-
ting on this hard seat.” .

Then came the kickoff and he begrudgingly rose,
vowing silently that he would not hop up and down all
afternoon even if everyone in front of him was stand-
ing and he couldn't see.

_ The cheerleaders made an effort to stir up enthusi-
asm, but “The Student” scratched his chin in an in-
tellectual gesture and whispered “Mickey Mouse” to
his date. He liked the yell that ended “Booyah”. how-
ever, because it reminded him of something T. S. Eliot
might have contrived.

As the score grew against his team he ascended even
more into his above-it-all attitude. Midway in the fourth
quarter he took his date by the arm, got up and left.

Gentlemen, how many of us fit into this mold?

The most disgusting thing Saturday was not on the
footbali field, it was in the grandstand.

When our team got behind due to a couple of inter-
cepted passes, (and I mean this in no way an alibi for,
ineptness or a request for enthusiasm when there is“no
cause for it,) most of us threw up our hands in frustra-
tion and, if actions prove anything, lost all interest in
the game. And this isn’t just true of Saturday; it occurs
regularily.

The players can tell when the students are not be-
hind them as anyone who has talked to them will tell
you.

One freshman, possibly irritated with the Court of
Control. remarked to me, ‘How can they expect us to
have class spirit in an institution where there is no school
Spirit.”

I know Davidson breeds intellects and sophisti-
cates, but when we get so psuedo-intellectual that we
can’t let our hair down a little bit and show some school
spirit for fear our dignity will be scarred, I think we
better re-examine our set of values.

A man may think he’s too big to stoop and ef-
fervesce at a ball game. However, “big” men do not
hesitate to encourage others. The ones that think they
are too big are really the little.

A New Star

A study in perserverence—cross countryman Lar-
ry McNeill.

Larry was a three sport star at McCauley Prep
School. When he came to Davidson he initially elected
to go out for basketball and baseball. His positions in
each were against him. In baseball, at first base, he had
to compete with slugger George Hart, in basketball at

Soccer Squad Meets W&L

By PETE WYRICK

After a disasterous home-
coming, Davidson’s football
squad journeys to Spartan-
burg to meet the Wofford
Terriers tomorrow night.

V.M.I. had gone undefeated
for their last fifteen games and
Dole’s men were secking a
homecoming upset. Two hours
later V.M.I. had extended its

victory string to sixteen games P

and the Wildcats were trudging
off the field on the short end
of a lopsided 42-7 score.

The strength of the visiting
team became readily apparent
when early in the ‘first quarter

ka went over standing up from

down. V.M.I. scored twice more
during the first half and left
the field at halftime with a 21-7
lead,

LONE SCORE

Davidson’s lone TD came late
in the second period as full-
back Dave Warden plunged
over from three yards out. Ush-
er converted, giving the Wild-
cats their final point of the aft-
ernoon.

The Keydets came out and
scored three more times in the
last half to squelch any hope of
a Davidson comeback. The Wild-
eats had come back strong in
the opening minutes of the third
quarter, but soon succumbed to
V.M.L's powerful ground and
aerial attack.

DAVIDSON DRIVE

A determined Davidson drive
was halted fifteen yards out.
This was the final 'Cat threat as
V.M.1, went on to lock up the
victory.

Tomorrow night in Spartan-
burg, Davidson runs up against
the Terriers of Wofford College
who will certainly be seeking

revenge for their defeat last,

year.

In last season’s contest the
Wildcats handed them their
first defeat of the season and

Davidson’s cross-country men place anunblemished conference record on the
line when they meet Richmond’s Spiders here tomorrow afternoon at 4:30. The
unbeaten ’Cat freshmen raced East and West Mecklenburg High Schools in a triangu-

lar match here today.

Last Friday at Greenville,
Angus McBryde loped in with
top honors as Davidson edged
Furman 36-37 and left the Cita-
del, with 51 points, far behind
in a three team meet. In the
freshman division, David Gil-
mour lost for the first time this
year as another Wildkitten,
strong-running Mack Brownlee,
finished the 2.8 mile distance in
16:11.

Larry Kinney, Ran Shaffner,
and Dave Page were also among
the top ten finishers as the
frosh turned their match into a
near rout.

RICHMOND MEET

Coach Heath Whittle sees to-
morrow’s match as a nip-and-
tuck affair, with Angus McBryde
being closely pressed by Rich-
mond's Cochrane. King Cole,
Whittle’s number three man,
will not be able to run because
of an injury

The real test comes this Wed-
nesday when both ‘Cat squads
journey to Lexington, Va., to
take on Washington & Lee and
VM. The powerful Keydets
will be hard.to beat but the
‘Cats should have little trou-
ble getting by W&L for a sec-
ond place finish.

Hermann Laimer at cen-
