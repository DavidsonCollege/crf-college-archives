Time for the yearly appointment
Detecting an STD that strikes college students

By JENNY HapGoop
Student Health Advisor

A little quiz for those who care about their
health: What sexually transmitted disease affects
more than ten million American women in their
late teens-and early twenties? The answer: papil-
loma. This week’s health advisor column is going
to focus very specifically on a sexually transmit-
ted disease that strikes quite frequently among
women and gay men. Papilloma is a sexually
transmitted virus that is passed between sexual
partners even when a condom is used. This virus
is the precursor to cancer of the cervix, anus, and
penis; it is quite dangerous since it often carries no
symptoms until it has progressed too far.

Severe cases of papilloma transform the
cells along the lining of the cervix or anus from
“orderly layers of tightly packed cells” to “a
palisade of bloated cells with bizarre, coal-black
nuclei” (Groopman 34). The lesions often appear
at the opening of the cervix/anus and once the
cells reach this disordered state, the lesions
progress to carcinoma and then to cervical/anal
cancer.

Even though traditional doctors believe that
papilloma is a disease for promiscuous girls, it is
actually the most common sexually transmitted
infection in the United States and Europe. In fact,
up to 75% of sexually active women will be

infected at some point in their lives. In most cases,
papilloma is transferred even when the male wears
a condom because the papilloma cells exist at the
head of the penis but also at the base where the
condom doesn’t reach. Thus, any rubbing -that
occurs between the base of the penis and the vagina
can result in the easy transfer of the papilloma
virus.

Likewise, papilloma is spread easily among
gay menas it lives on the outer edge of the anus just
as it lives on the rim of the cervix. In fact, “gay men
have been found to carry the same range of genital
papilloma viruses — including the cancer associ-
ated types 16 and 18 — that women do. And
sexually active gay men often carry many different
papilloma virus types” (Groopman 48).

. Though’ ve explained how easily this virus is
passed between partners, the good news is that it
normally dies on its own before progressing into
cancer-causing cells. However, that does not un-
derscore the necessity of having a yearly pap smear
for women or an anal exam for those practicing
arfal intercourse. Like many cancerous diseases,
the only way to survive the disease it to detect it
before it becomes dangerous. So, students, please
schedule your pelvic and anal exams at the health
center or with a private doctor, so you can ensure
your safety and the safety of those you love.
