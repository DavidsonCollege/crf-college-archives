It was in the closing minutes of
the game that the Davidsonians got
fire up for their lone score, The
break that put the Wildkitters in
scoring position was a State fumble,
their third, which Davidson's Don
Lazenby covered, On the next play,
guard Roy Johnson, former Central
High girdder of Charlotte, téok a
delayed hand-off from the quarter-
back and went 30 yards for the
score. The attempted conversion
Was no good, so the score stood at
12-6 as the final whistle sounded.
