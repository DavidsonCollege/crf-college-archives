Bobby Vinton isn’t in this Blue Velvet

By PRISCILLA FAUCETTE

Weird, bizarre, disturbing,
disgusting, and cool are some of
thé most oft-heard descriptions of
David Lynch’s new film Blue Vel-
vet.

If anything. this definitively
different film elicits strong reac-
tions. It tells the story of Jeffrey
_ Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan),
who one day finds a human ear on
the ground and then sets out on his
own to solve the mystery. He soon
becomes both voyeur and partici-
pant in a world which includes
kidnapping, rape, and various
other crimes.

STAR TREK IV
The one all of us trekkies have
’ been waiting for, Star Trek IV, fi-

nally hit the theaters Nov. 26.
Loyal fans, I tell you the long

queues in cold rain are worth it. -

Even if you’ve never heard of the
Genesis project or Bones or even
Vulcans, you should go as a lover
of science fiction.

While the exiled crew of the
USS Enterprise makes repairs on
_ their newly acquired Klingon ves-
sel, Spock rejuvenates his mem-
ory banks. The computers even
try to give him a taste of human-
ity, but he does noi see n to under-
stand. When they retuia to Earth
to face courtmartial, a probe re-
sembling the Doomsday Device

The leader of these machina-
tions is- Frank Booth (Dennis
Hooper), a personification of evil,
who screams “F---" alot, inhales
some kind of gaseous substance
and victimizes Dorothy Vallens
(Isabella Rossellini).

She's a night-club singer, por-
trayed as a tortured, loving mother
with unorthodox sexual prefer-
ances. Sandy (Laura Dern), Jef-
frey’s girlfriend, is the contrasting
Sweetness and innocence. She
lives in a world of pink heart-
Shaped pillows, flowers, sun-
shine, robins and church music.

And then there’s Jeffrey, the

with a suspended soccer ball in-
vades the solar system. Once
agai, without a thought to. the
contrary, they rush off to save
their planet from destruction.

This movie, unlike the previ-
ous three, has no real villain. The
probe, as we see, does not act with
hostility. Arguably the most hos-

_tile character in the film awaits

Kirk and Spock on a bus in San
Francisco in the 20th Century, in
the form of a punker blasting the
song “| Hate You” at them.

Their excursions about the —
city show the cast at their comic
best — subtle, serious and terri-
bly naive for time travellers. Dan-
gers are resolved through feats of
unselfishness..and. affection. Old
relationships are renewed, old

Its a Wonderful Life

By PRISCILLA FAUCFTTE

The Frank Capra Christmas.

favorite It’s a Wonderful Life is a

- touching story, appealing to all

ages. and worth seeing every
Christmas season.

The plot concerns George

Bailey (James Stewart), a very

lovable but frustrated man, who_

grows up dreaming about leaving
his small American hometown of
Bedford Falls. Most of his life,
from childhood to his present 39
years, is seen in flashback.

It seems as though George
goes through a series of “near-
misses” in that, just before he
~ Teaves for college, Europe, or his

honeymoon, something unex-
pected happens to prevent his
plans. Although George always
sacrifices his dreams for others,
he remains happy with his wife
(Donna Reed) and their four chil-
‘dren. His sense of entrappment
and dissatisfaction arises from a
responsibility to protect his family
and townsmen from the heartless,
greedy banker and all-around
' local meany, Henry F. Potter
“(Lionel Barrymore).

One re something so esibe

happens _ that George becomes

desperate and seriously questions
his “mispent” life. George’s guar-
dian angel, Clarence (Henry Trav-
ers) allows him to see life in a dif-
ferent perspective: what it would
be like had he not lived. The re-
sult? Well, go see the movie!
Yes, It’s a Wonderful Life can
be considered “corny,” “unrealis-
tic” and typically Capra, which is
principally why this film succeeds
40 years after its original release.
Stewart is excellent and subtley

witty. Reed, Barrymore and Trav-"

ers also give great performances.

It is a wonderful and poignant
- comedy, which deals with some

very serious questions concerning
small-town life and life in general.
Even the most typically indiffe-
rent cinema- goer will be cbt
to tears.

tunities tousee 7Tt’'s a Wonderful

from

wide-eyed, curious boy-next-door
who is perversely(?) attracted to
Dorothy and her environment. In
fact, one finds inconsistencies in
all of the characters’ personalities.
Which just goes to show you that
“the world is a very strange
place,” a theme reiterated
throughout the film. Imposing
close-ups, contrasting deep col-
ors, unexpected music and sur-
realistic sets are successfully com-
bined to create a very eerie and
dream-like atmosphere, though
obviously contrived.

Both the evil and idealized
worlds are exagerrated depictions;

habits are reasserted and our gal-
lant star trippers reunite to begin
where they left off. But you won’t
go just to see the old back-
through-time plot; you'll go to see
just who George and Gracie are,
and how they save the earth from
eternal perdition.

THE COLOR OF MONEY

Martin Scorsese’s _ latest
movie stars Paul Newman and
Tom Cruise. As in The Sting,
Newman is a con artist, but'to a
lesser degree.

He earns big money asa liquor
salesman and has apprentices who
hustle pool and give hima percen-
tage of the profits. He meets up
with Tom Cruise and, finding his
game impeccable, begins to work
on him. Cruise, young and naive,

but somehow, it all works well
within the dream-world of the en-
tire film. Lynch also does a great
job of evoking shock and sus-
pense. One may justly criticize
Blue Velvet for its occassionaly
weak script and over-acted perfor-
“mances (especially Dern) and for
contradictory and _ inexplicable
elements which are introduced
into the plot. These contradictions
are probably intentional and
sometimes too obvious.

_ The spectator often leaves the
theatre nervous and confused,
thinking nothing more than
“Wow, that was a cool film,” or

falls for Newman's pitch, and
they set out with Cruise's
girlfriend to work their way across
the country to the big match in At-
lantic City, cleaning up at every
pool hall along the way.

Somewhere along’ the line
Newman reconsiders his values.
A pool player himself once whose
game “ended before it really
began,” he gets caught up in the
pure, unadulterated love Cruise
has for the game. He contrasts this
with his own approach to pool,
which is to make the most money
no matter what. Cruise, on the
other hand, slowly learns what his
mentor had tried to tell him all
along, that “money won is twice
as Sweet as money earned.”

“Gross, that was terrible.” I can’t
recommend Blue Velvet to every-
one, because then you'd get mad
at me if you hated it, and this film
appears to be one of those poten-
tially hateable films, principally
for it’s violence and sexual frank-
ness. (If you were shocked and
disgusted by A Clockwork
Orange, don’t go.)

Despite its few inconsisten-
cies, I found the film to be a
funny, scary, sensual, thought-
provoking and captivating work.

sound, it-is not. The actors give
what you expect: Newman, his
good -looks, subtly rough voice
and charm; Cruise, his boyishness
and immaturity. But the charac-
ters do not mesh and the movie
does not work. When Newman
reaches down to turn on the radio
in his huge Cadillac in the shady
part of town, one half-expects
Frank Sinatra. Instead; behind a
loud beat Don Henley asks, “Who
owns this place?” Were this a
movie filled with action, the
music would be fitting. But in this
movie of dialogue and facial ex-
pressions, the music is another ex-
ample of the director’s apparent
shortsightedness. Scorsese tries to
bring too many elements into this

movie without, illustrating any of
them well. ~
