Davidson never ceases to
amaze me. Isn’t it i
Read the catalog, the
materials, talk to alumni and
administrators, and you’ll find
Davidson has a lot to offer.

For instance, Davidson is
dedicated to the development
of the ‘whole man” (and
woman.) We get four years of
liberal education in a tolerant
Christian atmosphere, a chan-
ce to explore different modes
of thinking and being, to learn

about how to cope
and how to live, to learn about
ourselves and others.

And, as if all of . these
somewhat ethereal goals of
not sufficient in themselves,
Davidson also offers a most

enticing fringe benefit: social.

and economic success.
“Yes, it’s.true; Davidson has
an awful lot of prestige and

graduate and professional
schools, and a rosy, suc-
cessful career.

The statistics which prove —

Davidson’s success in this lat-
ter area of fellowship and grad
schools are always close at
hand. And since about 90 per-
cent of the entering freshmen
want to go to grad school, and
since about 75 percent of the
seniors actually. go, you see
why these statistics are so im-
portant and appealing.

That is why I say Davidson
is unbelievable--because it
claims to be able to combine
these two disparate sets of
values into one educational ex-

i . I’m afraid that that
is too good to be true.

There is nothing wrong with

incompatability of two such
orientations. They mix about
as well as SPE’s. and Patter-
son Court.

Understand, first, that I’m
taking the worst view of the
matter for the sake of
polemic. I simply want to
make the point that at David-
son, like anywhere else, there
is a limit to the amount of cake
that one can simultaneously
have and eat.

The latter concept of

end-product oriented
education, is tangible, and
brings us distinction,

put out brochures on our SAT
averages and the number of
Rhodes Scholars we have

engendered.

That is also the main reason
most of us are paying to be
here. If things were just that
simple, we could all be
relatively content.

But of course, our preten-
sions are somewhat loftier.
The of our ~small
liberal arts college is that as
much concern and value is

placed on the process as on the

final reward, that our
education will ran wi

“Tiberalize’’ us, to free us.

miracles. I even believe that a
certain degree of integration
of the two philosophies can
take place, and that it is
possible that Davidson does a
better job of it than most
colleges.

There have been attempts,
almost always controversial,
to broaden the horizon, such

* as the JYA programs, the Cen-

ter for Honors Study, the
South Asian Studies program;
I appreciate the forces who
push for such changes, who
believe that Davidson should
be preparation for life as well
as for graduate school.

So I’m not bitching, nor am I
bitter. My point is this: to the
degree that Davidson places
ultimate value on the final,
predictable product, we are
stuck with an education which
consists of punching the clock,
‘of serving your time (four
years of hard labor), and of
receiving’ in the end your
reward of Davidson prestige
and a good law school, or
whatever.

I. think Davidson is in a
position to do more.

Coup Overthrows Free Radio

Heavily. armed soldiers of
the elite Wrotcee Brigade
stood in front of the building
from which Radio Free Void
broadcast its sometimes-
clandestine programs. I stop-
ped a passerby and asked him
the reason for this: curious ac-
tivity.

‘“‘Haven’t you heard?” he
said. “The government has
taken control of the radio
station. They ‘Say it’s because
they want to improve the
quality of the programming®
but everybody knows the real
reason is that they’re afraid of
some kind of coup or
something.

“After all, the station is
pretty radical, and who knows
what perverted acts they
could provoke certain malcon-
tents into performing? That’s
why they put the guards there-
-in case any of those weirdes

from the station try anything
funny. ” :

In that vicinity, the chair-
man of the kingdom addressed

e television viewers.

“My fellow citizens, I am
speaking to you tonight to
clear up any misun-
derstandings about the gover-
nment’s actions in _placing
Radio Freé Void under gover-
nment control. This was done
strictly to upgrade the quality
of the programming.

‘‘With this in mind, we are

Incident the First: In the
woods one late summer
pb ern ahd tir piecioner

canine corps a
himself upon us. sh oe

After much debate, this ob-
viously sick and: lonesome
creature was named Buzz, an
event far less interesting to
him than the bowl of chicken
scraps under his nose.

Buzz demanded a peculiar
form of communication. His
articulate heights were
reached with post-midnight
whines and whimpers outside
my window. One could not
reason with Buzz. ‘‘Your
future happiness, Sir, depends
on the cessation of your
‘struggles as I attempt to
remove these ticks.’’ No
progress.-  —

Buzz responded only to mut-
terings of endearment. ‘‘Dat’s
a good dog, yes it is, good food,
mmmmmmm, yeah!” A
satisfactory answer from
Buzz was a yawn.

Buzz departed after three
days of rest and recuperation.

Incident the Second: On a
late night pilgrimage to the
mists of the soccer field, an
unidentified wanderer was

‘joined by yet another campus

stray. Impressed. by the
hysteric mode of. com-
munication drifting over the

- trees from an outdoor party

band, the wanderer attempted
to revive the art of quiet con-
versation with the dog.

“Good I see you
also prefer to try your luck
away from the crowd. Do join
me. ”

Silence. >:

‘Do you see that airplane up
there? Ah, you hear it though.
Did you know that we allow
ourselves a classification as

higher beings than you.
because we can build and fly"
things like those lights
flashing up there? When they
crash, we can even figure out
what went wrong.”

Silence.

“I guess that doesn’t bother
you. You’re happy just plod-

~ding around out here. I bet you,

can smell things out here I’ll ‘\
never smell, though. At: least
you don’t scream - into
microphones.”’

Silence. But I think he un- ,
derstood, because he licked
my hand before he left.

Distinction the Second: The
point of all this rambling is
that we talk to each other like
we talk to our dogs. (The ob-
iject of my feeble muckraking
‘emerges.) Mumblings and
mutterings are our substitutes
for studied eloquence. Grun- -
ting lies around the corner (or
can be found on a Sunday mor-
ning clustered around the cof-
fee and Alka-Seltzer).

Mumbling is fine, but it
demands help in conveying
any intelligible content. One
‘couldn’t reach Buzz with his
favorite baby talk without pat-
ting his head or scratching
behind his ears.

If our words are to travel on:
.their own power, then they
‘deserve cultivation. Ar-
‘ticulation has its rewards, be
‘it as small as a licked hand.

We, too, can communicate

_ with gestures and touch, but

they can be saved to heighten
more intimate moments when
words fail: While words can
serve, the power of their gift

should be used.

| Next time’ you meet a cam-
pus dog, try something other
‘than a whistle and a scratch
and see if you don’t catch a
knowing twinkle in his eye.
