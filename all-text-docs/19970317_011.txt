‘Twenty member cast in
search of an audience

By HEATHER LARSON
Arts &Living Editor

Beginning this Wednesday at 8
p.m. and running until Saturday,
the cast and crew of Pirandello’s Six
Characters in Search of an Author,
as directed by Dr. Rupert Barber,
will entertain, inform, puzzle, and
no doubt surprise audiences in
Hodson Hall.

“That’s the most interesting
thing about the play to me,” says
cast member Ben Summers. “It’s
going to catch people off guard. It’s
not theater as most audience mem-
bers will probably be accustomed
to.”

Although to explain the details
of the play’s unconventional nature
would be to negate its impact, Dr.
Barber stressed the significance of

.the play in the scope of theatrical
history: opening the doors for later
nontraditionalist and absurdist mod-
ern theater, a riot ensued after its
first performance in the 1920s.

Josh Gaffga, playing the role
of the father, concurred that the
play’s strength lies in its ability to
question and challenge its audi-
ences. The generally bright
Davidson audience, Gaffga feels,
will especially benefit from the
play’s intellectual sensibility, and
believes most will find it refresh-
ingly stimulating.

Jess Robblee, the stepdaughter
in the fictitious family, claims the
play “will leave you with questions
about what is real and what isn’t.”

These issues of reality versus
illusion parallel those of reason ver-
sus emotion, and the audience is
called upon to make judgements for
themselves. This can only be done
objectively, however, when all sides
of the story have been given.

Perhaps Pirandello’s main
point of the play is this: pitting the
many and widely differing perspec-
tives of the characters to display
those perspectives’ disparity and
contradiction. Therefore, “not only

is there a battle of perspectives be-
tween those on stage, but those in
the audience are challengedas well,”
says Robblee.

Six Characters is not all aca-
demic, Gaffga assures. Although
he originally found it a bit stuffy to
read, he claims ithas become highly
exciting and fresh when acted out,
pointing to the text’s depth as a
resource for the actors’ continual
new discoveries about the play’s
philosophy.

He further credits some scenes
of improv, which are never quite
the same each night, for adding a
dimension of originality to the play
in action.

Tickets for the play are on sale
at the box office for $6 general
admission and $4 for students (but
will be $1 off on the opening night).

The large castincludes younger
members, Bill Giduz’s daughter and
Dr. Cain’s son, as well as a host of
Davidson students who all prom-
ise: this time, no riots.

Hanging by a thread

Senior art exhibition features sleepless

shelters, dangling anvils, electric blankets

By Peter SIMPSON
Guest Writer

_ John Harmon’s senior show,
Sucker’s Shelter, is on display until
March 22 at the Smith Gallery in
the VAC. Harmonis a senior studio
major from Arkansas, and the works
are the culmination of his Davidson
art career.

The show includes paintings,
sculpture, photography, and video
pieces which were all executed ina
three week period preceding the
show, which is a remarkable feat
considering the quality of the entire
installation.

There are two paintings on
stretched canvas, four large panels
which show a progression from a
pure and rough style of painting to
a bare wall with a working electri-
cal outlet and a small self portrait
hanging on it. One panel contains a
peephole that reveals a person sleep-
ing, bringing up the issue of voy-
eurism as well as making a playful
comment on how the viewer looks
at art.

The final work in the show is
the most dramatic: a metal arma-
ture, welded to the frame of an
actual bed, supports a tent of elec-
tric blankets which house a video
monitor andan anvil. A looped tape
of a rainfall plays on the monitor,
thus forming a strange world bathed
in digital light. _

If you saw the show during the
-crowded opening, it deserves a sec-
ond viewing the work’s quiet

strength can be felt. Harmon has
transformed the gallery space into a
bizarre dream world populated by
the recurring images of the bed, the
anvil, and his own self-portrait.
The dream state is furthered by
the sounds of a spring rain storm
playing on the video monitor hid-

-den under the covers of the bed and

by the subdued lighting. But this is
not quality sleep, for when you look
at the images on the wall, you are
struck by the inner tension of the
self-portraits staring back. The sur-
faces of these portraits are rough,
and the paint has been loosely ap-
plied; one features Harmon with a
blue face, another is a drawing which
has been applied to the canvas.

There is a similarity between
these paintings and the work of Egon
Schile, an Austrian artist whose
major. works were created in the
years before World War I, captur-
ing the anxieties and turbulent feel-
ings of that time. While Harmon
has shied away from the more sexu-
ally overt nature of Schile’s work,
he has captured a similar level of
taunt anxiety and intense soul
searching.

This tension is especially evi-
dent in an untitled painting where
Harmon places a drawing of him-
self under an anvil dangling by a
thin strand of rope.

The anvil is reused in other
images in the show; in a painting
where a figure is shown hiding un-
der the covers of a bed, on the
bedside. table, in a drawing that

John Harmon Quips&Cranks

serves in place of a self-portrait in
one of the large panels, and in the
bed sculpture where an actual anvil
rests on the mattress.

Harmon allows the anvil to
have more significance than a mere
pop icon: by placing it over his
head he equates the anvil with the
worries and cares which dangle over
all of us, and its replacement of a
self-portrait seems to be saying that
he sees qualities of the. anvil in
himself. Like the anvil, the image
of the bed is repeated throughout
much of the work with the large bed
sculpture as the ‘sucker’s shelter it-
self.

Speaking to Harmon about the
show and his intentions, he said that
he didn’t care how people felt upon
viewing it, as long as they were not
ambivalent. Considering the per-
sonal subject matter and the truthful
approach towards it, ambivalence
is the last attitude one should take
away from Sucker’s Shelter.
