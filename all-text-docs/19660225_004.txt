FRESHMEN SHINE

State Strangles
Local Grapplers

The Davidson wrestlers dropped their match to a
strong ACC opponent, North Carolina State, on Friday.
The grapplers anticipate a better showing this week;
they travel to Williamsburg Thursday to meet a fair

William & Mary team.

Last Friday's effort against
State was hampered severely by
the absence of Terry O'Hair and
Johnny Webb, both of whom suf-
fered shoulder injuries at East
Carolina in a disheartening Val-
entine’s Day defeat. Erich Nish-
ols bruised a rib resulting in
another forfeited weight class.
The two bright spots for the
‘Cats were Joe Buffington, who
easily decisioned his man, and
Lowell Bryan, whose opponent
was overcome in the first pe-
riod.

Another encouraging facet of
Friday’s encounter was the per-
formances of several freshmen.
In exhibition matches, Colin
Hudson and Dean Cromartie de-

feated members of the State
varsity. In another interesting
exhibition, freshman erry
Keith gave two-time ACC champ
Robert Brawley. of Mooresville,
a run for his money before los-
ing by decision.

Coach Charles Parker is get-
ting back to work after an oper-
ation last week. Coach Dave
Fagg took over during his ill-
ness. Davidson’s match with
The Citadel Monday could find
Fagg with schizophrenic loyal-

ties. Before coming to Davidson
last year, Fagg was responsible
for building up one of the South-
ern Conference's strongest wres-
tling teams there and many of
his proteges are still around.
The Southern Conference Tour-
nament March fourth and fifth
at Williamsburg should find the
team in excellent shape and near
full strength with the return of
Nichols and hopefully of O’Hair.

The Catfish with four
meets in two weeks came
out on the short end of the
deal, 1-3. losing to William
and Mary, VMI. and Geor-
gia, while posting a close
win over Clemson.

In an extremely close meet
with W&M, Davidson posted 47
points to the Indians’ 48. The
key event was the finale. the
400-yard freestyle relay. Nip and
tuck all the way. the race was
still up for grabs as anchor
man Tom Irons hit the water.
With only a slight disadvantage,

Holt Eclipses Records,
Readies For League Meet

By BOB REID
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Richard Holt set two school records and racked up 97 points to pace Davidson’s

swimmers this year.

In the East Carolina meet
Holt posted a 2:19.5 in the 200-
yard backstroke to better the old
college record by .7 seconds.
Then in the final meet of the
season against Georgia he
shaved off 1.4 seconds from his
old record in the 200-yard in-
dividual. mediey to set the new
school record at 2:17.6 minutes.

**Holt is one of the finest swim-
mers I've ever seen,"’ remark-
ed Coach Tom Stevens. ‘‘He’s
so relaxed in the water, and
that’s what it takes to be good.
Ever since Christmas he’s been
working real hard and that work
has paid off in steady improve-
ment.”*

“I've been swimming ever
since I was about six.” com-
mented Holt, a junior from
Houston, Texas. ‘‘My first meets
were with country club teams,
on the whole rather dippy!"’

Continued Holt, ‘‘My first ser-
ious competition swimming was
in high school. Our team wasn’t

baal

the best in the state, but we al-
ways made a respectable show-
ing. It resembled the Davidson
team, better than the record
shows.”

“My sophomore year in high
school I came in fourth in the
state meet in the individual med-
ley,” added Holt. “But during
the state meet my senior year
I swam the course four seconds
better than my time two years
earlier, and failed to place!”

As a Davidson freshman, Holt
set a pool record in the indi-
vidual medley, and “‘picked up
a few firsts here and there.”’

“My swimming record as a
sophomore can be described in
one word,’ quipped Holt, ‘Bad!
T was suffering from a terrible
case of physics and organic!
Studies sort.of got the best of
swimming that year.’* Neverthe-
less, Holt did win his letter.

“Right now we're ail looking
forward to the Southern Confer-

Holt. *‘We all feel like the team

Added Stevens, ‘I’m expect-
ing Holt to be a top contender in
the individual medley. The con-

seconds better than Richard's
best time, but with a little work,

Concerning next year’s season,
Stevens remarked, “If Richard

he has this year, I think he'll be
one of the finest swimmers Dav-

had expected to be an easy vic-
tory, put up a fierce battle. Tom
Irons, one of Davidson's strong
est swimmers was beaten in the
100-yard free, his favorite race.
Going into the 500-yard freestyle,
the meet was a tie. Gary
Peklo, with his best time of the
year, won a hard-fought second
place: co-captain John Helm
grabbed third. Next came the
200-yard breaststroke in which
Eddie Beach took a much-need-
ed first place. Together with
Peklo’s second, Beach's first put
the meet out of reach.

On Wednesday Georgia. in-|

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1966

It is not extremely difficult to pick out Lowell
a fellow standing 6-6 and weighing around 225 pounds
the distinctive feature about Bryan so far has

He has been entered in a total
of seven varsity matches this
year, six of which he won by
pins and the seventh on a for-
feit. Not only has he never lost
in varsity competition here, but
he has also totalled the maxi-
mum number of points possible
in so doing. All this he has done
in his sophomore year.

‘Coach Dave Fagg, recently
promoted to head wrestling
coach during Coach Charlie
Parker's illness, commented. “I
thing he has a lot of potential.
He has a lot of time ahead of
him.’ Bryan wonders how ser-
ious Fagg is, though, when he
sees his name written “Byran”’
on the board in the locker room.

A striking individual, Bryan
might seem the type who would
bare his teeth to the world; but,
in reality, he displays a good
sense of humor along with a
propensity toward arriving at a
good joke.:

Bryan began his wrestling ca-
reer in the seventh grade and

In his junior year at Yorktown
High School in Arlington, Va.,
he compounded an 8-1 slate for
the season. However, he lost
his starting job nis senior year
by a close margin to the event-
ual state champion of Virginia.

Not one to dwell upon his own
standing for long, Bryan com-
mented on the team and its fu-
ture. “We are going to have a
real loaded team next year, and
we'll be strong in every weight
class. I’m looking forward to

Taking a look back on the sea-
son so far and, at the same time,
ahead to the Southern Confer-
ence Tournament to be held
March 4-5, Bryan remarked that
some tough opponents were to
be found: “I wrestled a good
boy at The Citadel, and some
of the rest in the conference are
pretty good.”
