O’Brien’s clutch layup with about seven
seconds remaining put Davidson up by
a basket.

high, giving them tremendous confi-
dence as they headed into their final
home game against Appalachian State.

chian State had to have been one of the
most emotional in Davidson women’s
basketball history. Not only was it the

In the biggest regular season game in ‘the
Southern Conference in years, the men’s basket-
ball team Pepe Appalachian St. 68-58 Thursday
night at Belk
Arena. The win
was Davidson’s
second over the
Mountaineers this
season and gave

. the Wildcats their third straight league North Di-

vision title.

The week’s action left,the fierce rivals with
idential conference records of 132, but Davidson
—thanks to the season sweep of the Mountaineers
and Saturday’s victory over Georgia Southern —
will head to Greensboro this weekend as the top
seed in the league tournament.

While Mountaineer coach Buzz Peterson
billed the contest as a “magic moment,” coach Bob
McKillop and his Wildcats claimed to have treated
it as just another game.

And why not?

“Davidson’s been in this situation before,”
Peterson said after the game. “We haven't.”

It showed.

In front of 4,119 fans — the third-highest
output at Belk this season, behind only the Wake
Forest and UMass games — the Wildcats in the
first half hit six of their nine total three-pointers
and limited the Mountaineers to eight field goals,
taking a 32-21 advantage at intermission.

Trailing by a game-high 16 points with 14:01
remaining, Appalachian went ona 9-1 run, cutting
the Davidson lead to 47-39 — at which point Ben
Ebong, the Wildcats’ spark off the bench, sent a
wake-up call to his teammates.

Ebong, whose dunk put Davidson up for
good in the victory Jan. 31 in Boone, shed his man
with an up fake at the top of the key and flew down
the lane for a windmill jam.

The Wildcats’ lead never dipped below eight
thereafter.

“That dunk helped stop their run and really
juiced us up on defense,” said Mark Donnelly,
who scored 10 points in 31 minutes.

But the Wildcats won from behind the three-
point arc and on the boards. Davidson made nine
of its 20 long-range attempts, while cepemsn
hit just three in 16 tries.
