March 20, 1981—The Davidsonian—7

Coach Frank ‘really pleased’

Tennis team opens season with 6-1 record

The Davidson men’s tennis team has
raced to a strong 6-1 record in the
fast-paced beginning of the 1981 season.

Coach Jeff Frank said, ‘I’ve really
been pleased with the way the season’s
gone, obviously, with the big start we've
had.’’ The team has racked up six
important wins with a single loss by a
score of 7-2 at the hands of UNC-Chapel
Hill.

“We knew before the season started
that the first week was going to be a
really important week, and a tough one
because we played six matches in seven
days,” Frank said.

Davidson faced William and Mary,
Slippery Rock, West Chester, Roches-
ter, Penn State, Atlantic Christian, and
Presbyterian on consecutive days.

Among the team’s first-week victories
were wins over William and Mary (6-3),
Atlantic Christian (6-3) and Presbyter-
ian (5-4).

Davidson ran into a powerhouse
on Tuesday in a home match against
Carolina. Frank said, ‘‘The problem

you have when you play maybe
against each other, Nottingham winning
bottom of the ninth three-run homer to
sit back, relax, and enjoy a fine example
before they realize that the guy’s they’re
playing are not invincible and they can
play with them.” ;

Davidson’s two wins in the Carolina
match came in the number two singles
slot and the number one doubles
position. Senior Jay Gepfert downed
Tiger Buford (6-3, 7-5), and Gepfert and
senior Rick Johnston beat Roy Disco
and Chris Fenichell (6-4, 6-3).

Freshman Mark Nottingham also
showed great effort playing in the
number. one position. Nottingham bat-
tled Disco, an All-American, in a
marathon match before falling 7-5, 4-6,
1-6.

Gepfert and Nottingham have both
played the number one position. The two
have played two challenge matches

against each other with Nottingham

winning in the fall and gepfert winning
in the spring.

Frank said he is pleased by the
progress and performance of the other

Wildcat freshmen, John Bradham, Phil-
lip Crowder, Chip Fishback, and Tom
Ratchford.

The talent of returning upperclassmen
has made it difficult for freshmen to
break into the playing ranks. Gepfert,
Johnston, Nevins Todd, Victor Taylor,
and Nicholas Petrou all bring important
experience back to the squad.

The Wildcats have set 27 of 30
matches at home. Frank said he hopes
that the favorable schedule will result in
strong fan support. ‘‘We’ve got a fun
group to watch this year. They’re
talented, they’re emotional, and they’re
exciting.

The team has participated in a
mandatory weight lifting and running
conditioning program.

Encouraged by the hard-working atti- |
tude of the team, Frank flatly stated. ‘I.
would be disappointed if they didn’t
finish with 20 or more wins on the
season, and I would be disappointed if @
we weren't a factor in the Southern ©
Conference tournament.

Undefeated lady netters are Women’s track boasts enthusiasm
more prepared this season

Coach Pat Miller expects
another fine season from the
traditionally strong women’s
tennis team, and with good
reason. The squad is undefeated
in five matches.

On March 11 the ladies took
on a tough team from Peace of
Raleigh, the team responsible
for two of Davidson’s four
match losses last season. Miller
expected strong competition,
and noted, ‘'We had played
them eight times since I’ve been
here. and never beaten them.”
The Wildcat women rose to the
occasion with a big 5-4 victory.

Miller describes the team as
‘‘more prepared’’ than last
year’s 12-4 squad. “I’ve spent
more time with them, and they
have practiced harder.’’ She
calls the team ‘‘one of the top
four teams in the. state,” but
expects competition from defen-
ding North Carolina Associa-

holds down the number two
singles position. Knoblock and
McArn are unbeaten in singles
and from an undefeated doubles
team in the number one spot.

Senior Anne Stanback jump-
ed from the sixth to the third
singles position this year. She
and senior Grace Morgan com-
prise the number two doubles
combination.

Sophomore Catherine Smith
and junior Adelaide Wilcox
play number four and five
singles, respectively, in addi-
tion to forming the third doub-
les team. Freshman Adelyn
Lutz completes the starting
line-up.

Coach Miller commented that
this year’s team has good depth
provided by Leesa McPhail,
Joanna Fleming, Mary Eliza-
beth Cranford, and Tanda
Witherspoon.

Miller hopes that the team
can match the strong post-sea-
son play of last year’s team,

Under the direction of Coach
Lisa Boyer, the women’s track
team aims to get new marks
during the coming spring sea-
son.

This is Coach Boyer’s first
year at Davidson.

The team roster sports an
extremely young but enthusi-
astic squad, with only three
upperclassmen: senior Barb
Ashley and juniors Diane Dow-
ning and Cindy Hendricks.

The team competes on a
limited schedule due to the lack
of similarly qualified oppon-
ents. Though Davidson offers
no scholarships, the team must
compete in Divison II -of the
Association of Intercollegiate

Athletics for Women (AIAW)
because there are no Division
III teams in the state. Coach

‘Boyer commented that compe-

ting against such powerhouses
as UNC-Chapel Hill, N.C.
State and East Carolina Uni-
versity is well-nigh impossible.

As a result, the women will

‘ compete in only four meets.

Davidson will face Appalachian
on Saturday, Lynchburg on
March 28, Guilford and Duke
on April 11, and will participate
in the Davidson Relays on April
4.

The team’s strength lies in
the distance and middle-dis-
tance events. Sophomores Mar-
ian Hill and Merris Hollings-
worth bring experience to the
longer distance competiton.

Barb Ashley, Diane Downing,
sophomore Nancy Stoudt, and
freshman Laura Hills will com-
pete in the 400, 800 and team
relays.

Cindy Hendricks and fresh-
man Leslie Bryan will handle
most of the field event work.
Bryan and freshman Elizabeth
Smiley bring good experience to
the hurdles events.

Nancy Stoudt and freshman
Suzanne Dickey will work out in
the short distance sprints.

Also competing for Davidson
are sophomore Karrie Buckner
and freshman Courtney Hall.

Despite the limited schedule,
Coach Boyer said, ‘‘We would
like everyone to get their own
personal bests this year.’’
