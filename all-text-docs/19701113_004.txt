A Worthwhile Option

It cannot be denied that the maligned and mis-
understood Extended Studies program offers the stu-
dent far more opportunity for innovation than the
Blue: Sky gram. ever did.

In addition to passing area exams, the student
may opt to take extra courses, study guided by ex-
tensive reading lists, or initiate and complete special
projects. '

It is this last option which we would like to em-
phasize here, lly to the freshmen and sopho-
mores. Recently there have been a number of an-
nouncements around Davidson describing indepen-
dent tie projects which various students have
been able to arrange. ;

These are pethabe the most encouraging edu-
cational development at Davidson since the Blue
Sky Program was first conceived. President Spencer
and Vice President Bevan have commented several
times this year that they hope to expand special and
off campus study opportunities extensively in the
near future.

Yet these projects give the student that type
of freedom and opportunity now. And anyone with
the chance would be seriously weakening ‘his edu-
cation if he did not grasp the opportunity now. |

As we have pointed out in these columns be-
fore, the Davidson education is too often undeserv-
ing of the name. If the underclassmen have not real-
ized that by now, they should ask upperclassmen.
Chances are, few could be found who are satisfied
with the course structure of education at Davidson.

They are for the most part tired of “taking”
a course, being “given” information, guessing the,
word in the professor’s head, or attending 75 per-
cent of their class meetings under punishment of
failure. sa
But now there is a way out. To be sure it is a
way. that requires a little extra time in -planning,
a little extra foresight in goals, a little extra imagin-
ation in execution—in short a little thought.

Initiating a truly unique and independent ex-
tended studies project would not be as easy as
ae a course, but it might be a lot more educa-
tional.

End National Shame

It seems that the searching examination of our
lives and the reconciliation of our tensions which
should have come from the tradegies at Kent State
and Jackson State last spring will continue to clude
us for some time to come*~

A summary of the FBI report on Kent State
as reported in last Monday’s “Chronicle of Higher
Education’ reveals several important contradictions
-with the findings of an Ohio grand jury investi-
gation which indicted 25 students but no National

uardsmen two weeks ago.

_ Mainly the FBI report does not. justify the kill-
ings by the guardsmen as did the grand jury re-
port; ‘and it goes so far as to say that there is “some
reason to believe that the claim by the National
Guard that their lives were endangered by the stu-
dents was fabricated subsequent to the event.”

It is a shame that the Ohio report should have

been so misguided as to place blame on the stu-
dents and Kent State administration alone.
__» Perhaps much better wisdom is to be found
in the Scranton Report on campus unrest which
Stated, “Out of our divisions, we must now recreate
understanding. . . Violence must end. . . Reconcila-
tion must begin. . . We must start. All of us.”

line read.

Football Costs Ind

‘vidson football is defense-,

Jess.

The Observer was referr-
ing to the team; however, I
am referring to the entire
program. *

I spent a recent afternoon
with two Bob’s and a Steve,
finding out how defenseless
the program is: Robert A.
Currie, College treasurer
and business manager, and
Robert W., Davidson, comp-
troller, gave me money in-
formation. :

First the trustees’ limiting
of football scholarships does
not go into effect until next
year, This year the usual
fifty-two scholarships were
given; That’s 52.X $2,920.00
or $151,840.00.

Even when the new plan
goes into effect providing 52
times the average non-ath-
letic grant from the general
funds for football scholar-
ships, ec: players will
receive a sproportionate
amount of college funds.

The rationale of the col-
lege funding football scho-
larships according to the 52
times the average non-athe-
letic grant was that financi-
al need would, qualify. many
of the players for aid un-
der the regular program.

But the equation is decep-
tive because the new plan
will offer about twice as
much in college funds for
the 52 football -grants.

You see, less than half
the student body receives
financial aid and it. is from
this half that the base fig-
ure (to be multiplied by 52)
is derived for figuring foot-
ball funds.

To put the football scho-
larships on. an equal basis
would have required using
the average non-atheletic
grant including non-athletes
who received no financial as-
sistance from the college.

than. $150; this year and
the more than $40,000 the
College gives for football
scholarships is divied up as
the atheletic department
sees fit, not necessarly on
merit or need.

Secondly, my buddies in
the southwest end of Cham-
bers told me that the College
will continue financing the
non-scholarship parts of the
football program including
everything from coaches
Salaries to the training ta-
ble, to game traveling ex-
penses and so on; to the tune
of more than -$100,000.00.

(Although no exact figures
on this year were available
since it’s all figured to-
bether as ,an athletic bud-
the commission study
released last year put this
figure at $117,000. That's a
pretty penny to pay,’ even
for a winning season.

Thirdly, the Bob's. don't
know how important football
is to alumni support. They’
don't /even have figures on
how important alumni sup-

-port is to the College's fin-

ancial status since some of
these: funds are from trust
funds set up years ago and
since some gifts from non-
alumni are due to alumni
influence with their friends
and various foundations.
While | was in the south-
west corner of Chambers, |
asked about a few projects
supposedly turned down be-
cause of a lack of funds:
such as.a gift of an electron

microscope the College did

not accept supposedly be-
cause we could not afford a
technician to run it or the
$180,000 research grant the
College would not match
with the required $30,000. -

“Times are tight,’’ Currie
explained, ‘‘the college has
to make choices.”

Unenlightened as to the
raison d’etre of the football
program (when times are
tight), I went to talk to the
Wildcat Club's football fund
raiser, Steve Heckard, who
said he is more than $100,000
away from the $150,000 goal
he hopes to meet by Decem-
ber 31.

Heckard’s for

DICK ANDERSON

argument

efensible

football was tripartite: (1)
the need for a well-rounded
student body; (2) support
for the entire athetic pro-
gram (especially basket-
ball) (3) sense of communi-

ty.

The first point was mainly
a matter of ‘we need more
than just eggheads.’ The se-
cond was that ‘jocks like to
be with jocks’ and that
basketball recruiting would
be hurt by a smaftiler jock
community.

The sense of community
point was lost on me. but it
had to do with school spirit
engendered by the gridiron
battles and all that.

Heckard asked me. to be
fair in my criticism of the
program so I'll try. After
all, some of my best friends
play football.

But some of my best
friends’ scholarships were
shafted. And some of my
best friends research op-
portunities were junked.

And _ social’ involvement
and coeducation are term-
ed ‘‘too expensive.”

The other athletic. pro-
grams: don’t cost as much
and therefore aren’t as sub-
ject to criticism on these
grounds. In fact, according
to Comptroller Davidson,
basketball ‘has cleared from
$40,000 to $90,000 in recent
years,

But Davidson football re-
mains not only defenseless
but very expensive and
grossly offensive.

A Russian Crime

‘‘Do I have the power?”’

Raskolnikov said to the old

woman in ‘Dostoyevsky's
Crime and Punishment. ‘‘Am
I just a louse, or do I have
the power?”’

In a sense. the persecuted
Soviet author Aleksandr Sol-
zhenitsyn is the spiritual
successor to Dostoyevsky's
hero.

When. Solzhenitsyn com-
mits the crime of writing
novels and stories critical of
the Soviet state, what he is
doing ‘is. attempting to estab-
lish his power, or his right
(in Russian the words coin-
cide in this sense), to ex-
press the truth.

That activity is a crime
in the Soviet Union, whether
it takes the form of bureau-
cratic corruption, of actual-
counter-revolution, or of
anti-Soviet’ writing.

The name _ Raskolnikov
means ,‘‘breaker”’’ or ‘‘schis-
matic.”’ It is linked with the
refusal of certain Russian
Orthodox believers who re-
fused to accept a change in
Orthodox belief and became
heretics in the 19th century,

known as the “Old Be-
liever,” ‘‘raskolniki.”’
Solzhenitsyn (and the

others: Yuri Daniel, Andrei a

Sinyavsky, etc.) are a rec-
currence of the raskolniki in
modern Russia.

They ‘have refused the
change in literary belief im-
plicit in the doctrine or
“socialist realism,"
made Russian literature a
servam of the party rather

~

which *_

than the servant of the truth
which it had always been,
even under Tsarist censor-
ship.

Kuznetsov, the writer who
defected last year to Eng-
land, is not one of these.
Kuznetsov gives as his rea-
son for defecting the fact
that the KGB forced him to
spy on his fellow writers.

ANDERSON

Unlike Kuznetsov,  Solz-
henitsyn does not even want
to' leave. There hawe been
various efforts by the So-
viets to persuade him to ac-
cept exile in, for instance,
Finland, but he refuses to
depart, to give up his faith
in Russia.

It is perhaps strange to
compare a murderer to a
great author, for Raskolni-
kov’s crime is not to be
thought of in the same terms
as Solzhenitsyn’s creativity.
But Dostoyevsky’s point was
man’s assertion of his pow-
er to decide his. destiny de-
spite fate.

Solzhenitsyn writes to

prove he has this same pow-

er of decision despite. the
‘Marxist’s historical inevita-
bility.
