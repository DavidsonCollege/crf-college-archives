SPIRIT.

Davidson College has always been
considered unique. In tradition and
truth its ideals and ideas have been diff-
erent from the vast majority of other
colleges of its kind. Among the col-
leges of North Carolina, Davidson. is
singular in having but one department;
the academi¢, and in niany of its princi-
ples it stands alone. But as long as the
name of Davidsoiv is associated with
those things that make for — student
strength and alumni lovalty and a wide
sphere of influence, it is an honor to be
unique.

‘Two words that quickly suggest one
another are “Davidson’ and “spirit.”
The Freshman before he. enters callege
and the Senior long after he leaves, both
hear the phrase as a svmbol of the pow-
er behind the throne in all) of David-
son's athletic and literary successes. It
is spoken of as a sort of magic power, at
a distance. Alumni of every class
proudly point back Vto “the — old-tivae
Davidson spirit” when thes were ia
college, a thing thar made Davidson
unique. :

But what does it really stand for? ft
is not a vague intangible farce that rests
upon the campus like the atmosphere
and captures régularly the heart of
every new man that comes. Tt is: vari-
able, noreconstane. Te is what the stu-

dents are and .thatk and feel. Every
class adds to or weakens i. Every man

helps to increase or diminish it. How
long Wil the Davidson spirit be unique?

Tr will be uniqiie as long as the Dav-
idson student body throws itself, heart
and soul, into every activity of the col-
lege.

Ir will be unique as long vas every
student stands hehind every team to the
last inch.

. . .

It will be unique as long jas a victory
is counted glory, bat a hard game and
fair fight, no less glory.

Tt will be uniave as long as we deé-
pend ‘upon ‘the enthusiasm of the square
jaw as rhuch as the enthusiasm of the
throat.

Tt will be uniqne as long as every
Davidson man is workiiig fer Davidsin
and for everything that will make her
better. ,

The Davidson spirit. depends on the
spirit of every individual student.

TRAINING CAMPS.

The criticism is often made of our
merican athletics. and various college
Antests that such a select few of the
men in college actually engage in them.
In Great Britain a mach larger per-
centage of university students take act-
ive part in university sports. This has
led tu a severe artaingement ‘on the part
of some critics of the methods and pur-
poses of American athletics. No college
man will say that every team should
represent the best that the college can
put forth, yet it is a discouraging feature
that a large amount of its athletic and
literary activities are carried on by a
small part of the men, and that a great

‘number are content to have their share

done by proxy.

The feeling that there is such a small
chance for the average, man through
lack of experience and advantage 1s
largely responsible for this attitude. It
is less noticeable at Davidson than at
anv of the larger institutions, but an
increased. interest in “trying for the
team” might be the means of bringing
to the front some latent and. undevelop-
ed talent. very man has an opening
to the big’ teams through the training
camps this spring.

If a man wants to have a_ better
chance for the baseball team next vear
(or a chance to learn to plav) let him
vo out for the class games this spring.
It is better to muff a fly and strike out
trying than to sit in vour, room and be-
moan the fact that vour chiss has no
‘team, or that there will be no chance
for von next year.

The.same is true of débating.  Be-
cause only two men make the debating
team each vear, and will represent us
next week against Wake Forest, does
‘not exctiide the ordinary society worker
from the honor. At the closé of the
Fresh-Soph and Junior-Senior Debates
this spring, there should be a dozen
more men eligible for the team next
vear,

TO-OTHER COLLEGES.

The purpose of establishing The
Davidsonian has been net only te depict
college life as we see ft on our-sawn
“ompus, but as we see it in other col-
leves. We. feel that we are but one
unit in, the great) army of American
Colleges, and it is evr earnest hope tha:
by the aid of our newspaper even closer
bonds may. be knit between us and
these other colleges with whom we have
so much in: common. Your criticism
and co-operation will be appreciated by
us. If vou do not like, our paper, tell
us so, and tell us why. We will try. to
remedy the defect. Tf you de like our

paper, be sure to tell us. for the life of

the amateur journalistvis one of trials
and tribulations, and we are in need of
whatever encouragement we may re-
ecive. ,
