The same week that Dean Rusk, the sixth of David-
son’s Rhodes Scholars, was notified of his appointment

Sewanee ‘is also leading in the
South percentage-wise.

Spirited Majority Gives
Faculty Drink Problem

The Davidson student body voted overwhelmingly yesterday to abolish the

for deletion; 90, against.

The clause. which is Article
10, section 3 of the Student
Body Constitution, reads, ‘No
student shall be guilty of being
under the influence of alcohol-

Although by their vote the
Student body has relieved it-

H. Edmunds White, associate
director of admission, stated
that he was very pleased with
the group which has been ac-
cepted. Twenty-three of the
28 had a B plus high school
average or better. Thirteen
won varsity letters, while 15
belonged to either the Nation-
al Honor Society or the Beta
Club. Sixteen were or are preb-
idents of their church youth

groups.

Ten of the group were stu-
dent council members and six
serve as editors of either
their school annual or news-
paper. Their average scores
on the scholastic aptitude test
(which may be expected to
improve 30-40 points as senior
scores) were 575, verbal, and
638, math.

This plan requires that the
applicant not apply to any
other college until Davidson has
had time to review his applica-
tion. This insures the fact that
Davidson is the applicant’s first
choice. Of course, the appli-
eant is released to apply to
other colleges if his application
is refused. All 28 who have
been accepted have paid a
$100 deposit fee.

Staples had already contracted

upon hearing of the proposed

Drake agreed that he was not
aware of the situation when
the committee first considered
next year’s calendar. However,
his committee met again on
Dec. 28 to discuss the situation
“in light of the questions Dr.

RINGE FORESEES PROBLEMS

Charles Ringe, director at
last year’s: Freshman Camp,
foresaw problems in attempting
to hold the camp on Labor Day
weekend. “We could not get
the staff back since many will
hold jobs running through La-
bor Day,” he said. Also. be
noted that it would be difficult
to get a camo site for the busy
holiday weekend.

The YMCA Cabinet has un-
animously recommended that
the Freshman Camp be contin-
ued. Staples and Ringe have
requested a hearing for their
case before the faculty, and
hope to have the 1961-62 year
begin later.

President D. Grier Martin,
himsélf a member of the Y Cab-
inet, has promised them a hear-
ing. Said Martin: “I hope we
can work out some sort of ar-
rangement whereby this com-
plex situation can be worked
out.”
