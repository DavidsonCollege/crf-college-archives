COMING SUNDAY.

All Davidson students and towns peo-
ple who heard the Columbia Seminary

of about six men from the seminary will
have charge of the church and “Y”
services. With the exception of one
man, the same quartette that we heard
last year will be here. The quartette

McKEITHEN, McILWAINE AND
MOORE TALK TO VOLUNTEERS

A very interesting mission study~pro-
gram on Japan was conducted by Har-
old McKeithen, Bob Mcliwaine and Wal-
lace Moore at the Volunteer band meet-
ing in the gym last Sunday morning.

McKeithen, from the standpoint of the
student of Japanese affairs, spoke of
Japan’s rapid growth and acquirement
of the advantages of civilization.

This has come about not merely by
imitation of others, but by her own ex-
ertions; also mentioned. was Japan's
growing policy of fairness toward China,
agreeing to return to China all of her

j \
disputed territory as soon as China pays

her the majority of the 50,000,000 marks
agreed upon as adequate reimbursement
for Japanese expenditures in Shantung,
etc. ‘

McIlwaine and Moore then spoke from
their own experience and observations
of the relations existing between Chris-
tianity, Buddhism and Shintoism in
Japan and the work of the Christian
missionaries there, which, according to a
statement by Col Alfred E. Buck, late
U. S. Minister to Japan, has been worth
more to Japan than all other foreign
influences combined.

RURAL SCHOOL ATTENDANCE
HURT BY THE BAD WEATHER

The attendance at all the country Sun-
day Schools was poor last Sunday,
largely on account of the bad weather.

Shearer had probably the best record
with thirty members and four teachers
present. After Sunday School the reg-
ular church service was held. Sunday
night Gamble spoke there in the interest
of Christian Endeavor. There wilt be a
prayer meeting Wednesday night and a
social Friday night, both at eight o'clock.

At Brawley’s the attendance was good.
considering the condition of the roads
and the bad weather. There were 23
members present.

No services were held at Oak Grove on
account of weather conditions.

Cc. E. TRAINING CLASS PUTS
ON EXPERT ENDEAVOR STUDY

On the fourth Sunday in January the
Christian Endeavor Training class
among the students started a class in
Expert Endeavor. The Training Class
itself was organized last fall under the
auspices of the Christian Activities Com-
mittee of the Y. M.C. A. The new class
is only another step forward, which, it is
hoped, will provide a means for further
advancement along Christian lines.

The expert course is to last ten weeks
and when completed will entitle the suc-
cessful ones to wear Christian Endeav-
or badge and also to place these letters
after their names when writing Chris-
tion Endeavor correspondence. At pres-
ent the class has an enrollment of 24
students. At the end of the ten weeks’
course an examination in Expert Endeavy-
or will be given and those making a
grade of 75 or above will be considered
as successful. The class is being taught
by Arnett Gamble, who is himself a
Christian Endeavor Expert.

During the fall the work of the train-
ing class was given to the discussion of
the general problems of the Christian
Endeavor field. At the close of the Ex-
pert Course the general conferences and
presentation of plans will be resumed.

MINISTERIAL BAND MEMBERS
HAVE FREE FOR ALL TALKS

Last Sunday’s Ministerial Band meet®
ing was without the customary program
and instead was opened -to matters per-
taining to and suggestions for the pro-
motion of the band’s work. After the
devotional service, discussion took place
on the advisability of an attendance
campaign. Different methods of con-
ducting this campaign were brought out
but it was finally decided to refer the
matter to the attendance committee for
its consideration.

Personal work was stressed at this
meeting as the opportunity and duty of
all Christians on the campus. The im-
portance of the proper spirit and under-
standing of the individual with whom
one is dealing was shown to be of great
moment. The value of prayer and es-
pecially its relation to the short morn-
ing watch was attested by a number of
those present. Plans are at present un-
der consideration for conducting a watch
every morning for the term, Those who
have tried a short watch alone in their
rooms or with a few others can easily
note the worth of getting a good start
before each day’s work.

A deputation to Gastonia has been ar-
ranged and other deputations are being
planned for the spring term.

The band is looking forward to the
visit of the quartete from Columbia The-
ological Seminary next Sunday. These

jmen are real singers and some good

music is anticipated.

“Y” DEPUTATION HAS FULL
PROGRAM IN CONCORD TOWN

¢

The deputation sent to Concord on
last Sunday, under the auspices of the
Y. M. C. A., composed of Junebug Price,
Dwight Chalmers, Wallace Purdy, and
the “Y” quartette, spent a very busy day,
both on Sunday and Monday, Price,
Buchanan and Chalmers spoke several
times on Sunday, and three times Mon-
day morning. The quartette sang seven
times on Sunday and ten times on Mon-
day morning. f

The quartette sang at the First Bap-
tist Church at the morning service,
where the pastor preached a powerful
sermon on the subject, “Dogmatic Chris-
tianity Pragmatized.”

The first service in the afternoon was
held at 2:30 in the First Baptist Church,
being a meeting of all the B. Y. P. U.
societies of Concord. Dwight Chalmers
was the speaker at this service, and
chose as his subject “Loyalty to Christ,”
the’B. Y. P. U.. watchword.

At 3:00 o'clock an open meeting was
held at the Y. M. C. A., where a large
and interested audience heard Price and
Buchanan. Junebug told of the home
life of a Chinese boy and that of the
Chinese girl, making some striking con-
trasts. He brought out forcibly the
method. of teaching in the schools, that
of requiring the pupils to memorize
their work page by page, and explained
how difficult it is for a Chinaman to re-
ceive a degree.

Stewart Buchanan followed Junebug
with an interesting discourse on the life
of a missionary’s child in Japan. He ex-
plained the wonderful hospitality and
politeness of the Japanese people in an
unusually interesting way. He told of
the different games played by Japanese
children. Many instances were cited by
him to show the intellectual ability and
mechanical skill of the Japanese boy.

At the Boys’ “Hi-Y” meeting, held
immediately after the open meeting,
Price and Chalmers were the speakers,
taking the subject “A Winning Team.”
A goodly number of teen-age boys were

present at this meeting and showed: a’

great deal of interest in the speeches.
Price spoke, first, bringing out in a con-

vincing manner three ways in which|

John the Baptist was an ideal team-
mate: (1) He followed instructions; (2)
he was loyal to his captain; and (3) he
did not claim the praise for the victory.
Dwight followed up this talk with a
well-chosen speech in which he pictured
Christ as the captain of a team, and gave
some striking instances to bring out
why Christ is the ideal captain. He
mentioned three of these qualities, cheer-+
fulness, courage, and helpfulness.

graded schools on “Clean Scholarship.”
Price spoke on “How to ‘Study,” and
compared cheating in scholastic work to
stealing, concluding with the statement
that—a—person who signs his name to
work which has been copied is a liar.

Dwight in his talk gave some good
reasons as to why a pupil should study.

The work of the “ quartette was
the feature of every meeting. They had
complete charge of the music at the
evening service of the First Presbyterian
Church, the program including two
quartette selections, a.violin solo by
Buchanan, and a vocal solo by Allison.
Monday morning at three schools the
quartette sang with repeated encores
their selections ranging from “Tuck Me
to Sleep in my Old Tucky Home,” to
“Mr. Moon.” “O! Davidson” was the
most popular selection at every stop.

Wallace Purdy proved a_ versatile
artist at the piano, performing on all
sorts of instruments without the least
sign of uneasiness.

The fact that they have been invited
to return is an evidence of the merit of
the quartette.

office of the State Student Secretary
show that an average of forty-cight per-
cent of ‘Arkansas college men attend
Sunday School each Sunday.

Williams College has completed a Wil-
liams-in-Soochow campaign, raising in
two days $5,800 from a student body of
500. This campaign is largely the
growth of a year’s program of mission-
ary education. The largest previous
missionary gift by Williams students
was $500.

University of Pittsburg reports a good
attendance at a weekly “straight reli-
gious talk” at the noon hour.

Dickinson College is raising $1,500 for
the support of a teacher in West China

press the goal has very nearly been
reached.

Maryville College publishes a weekly
