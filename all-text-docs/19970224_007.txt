Two ID’s at the door

Arecruiting video still shown to prospective Davidson students was commissioned
by the Admissions office some years ago. In it, the day’s last rays of sun lit sweeping
vistas of Davidson’s verdant landscape, as Georgian edifices stood strong, like eques-
trian statues of eighteenth century army generals. In short, it looked the way a liberal
arts college is supposed to look.

Of course, admissions videos are just advertisements, and any Madison Avenue
adman will tell you that a good advertisement understands and appeals to its intended
market. Also, it helps to have a catchy jingle, since music aids in creating stronger
product association. With eleventh- and twelfth-graders ostensibly curious in a
Southern liberal arts college as its target audience, the video had to ensure its viewers
saw Davidson as a hip, fun, yet inspiring place with some clout.

So the video opened and ended with a jingle, “Closer to Fine,” by the Indigo Girls,
with footage of their concert here. On the surface, it seemed a fitting slogan, the way
“Like arock” works for Chevy trucks. Bouncy and strumming, “Closer to Fine” implies
some sort of daily joy, the thrill of being on the quest for fulfillment, feelings one would
want to associate with one’s undergraduate years. Yet, the Indigo Girls are known for
being folksy, progressive lesbians as much as they are for their folksy, progressive
music — which in and of itself is not a bad thing. But who among us would readily
associate grass-rootsy lesbianism with Davidson? It seems fairly incongruous.

Using the footage of the Indigo Girls in a Davidson recruitment video highlights the
College’s glaring identity crisis. It wants to have it both ways: traditional, yet
progressive; Southern but cosmopolitan; Christian, yet welcoming toward religious
diversity. In short, the College tries to be all things to all people, or at least appear to
try to be all things to all people.

Some may argue that these are not real dichotomies—that a college can be both
traditional and progressive, can hold fast its old roots while growing new ones. Perhaps.
But if such supposed extremes can be reconciled, there is no evidence that Davidson is
accomplishing this smoothly. ,

Talk to minority students about what the College does to support them after
recruiting them to enroll, for example. Or ask a non-Christian student how he or she
feels walking past crosses on the way to Chambers. Inquire of a Christian student about
the level of anti-Christian sentiment in the student body. Consider the voyeurism of the
annual Sexuality Forum, or former student Yanti Ardie’s Opinions piece last semester
which equated international students to freaks on display.

Likely, one would discover that all of these people find themselves stranded
between the bucolic Davidson they anticipated before arrival and the Davidson they
came to realize was here first. When students enroll at Davidson, they should be able
to know what kind of environment they are entering. Catchphrases and associations
shouldn’t cloud that. In its duality, perhaps the video is very indicative of Davidson’s
identity crisis.

Preserve wooded area on Beaty Street

To the Editors:

Davidson is about to sell
valuable city-owned land on
Beaty Street, including apris-
tine, wooded pond, to devel-
opers. This land would bet-
ter be kept as public land for

the enjoyment of the citizens
of Davidson, perhaps as a
large area public park with
nature trails or as a nature
preserve. Perhaps it could be
sold to the N.C. Nature Con-
servatory instead. One of the
