Trying new things isn’t bad. I need to learn
that. My purchase and subsequent enjoyment of
the Jewel album helped to dispel some of my
musical fears; nonetheless, I remain apprehensive.
Iam the guy who orders a #2 value meal every time
he visits McDonalds, a #1 combo at Chick-Fil-A,
and Cashew Chicken at every Chinese place — I
like to have regularity in my life. Therefore,
despite my successful venture into the unknown,
for this edition of my column I must return to the
basics. For now, that means Dosage (Atlantic,
1999), the new record from Collective Soul.

“Shine,” “December,” and “The World I
Know” (that deliciously cool chorus that ran

through your mind all day in tenth grade), el-
evated the band to star status. As a result, they
have to play good music now. They can only mess
around with new sounds or ideas to a certain
extent. They must “stick with what got them
there.” “Dosage” is an album produced under that
light. It is chock full of simple, catchy tunes that
won’t scare fans away. The only problem is that
they probably won’t gain any new ones.

Don’t get me wrong — these Atlanta boys
have turned out a fine effort. Surely a few tunes
from Dosage will turn up on their Greatest Hits

‘album in five years or so. I do appreciate the

consistency of their sound. I marvel at the way
they make a G-C-D chord progression sound like
it was the coolest thing in music.’

Even so, this new record doesn’t really ac-
complish anything. Maybe it’s that whole fourth
album curse. After all,
who can remember a
breakout fourth album?
Well, maybe Led
Zeppelin’s untitled al-
bum (commonly called
Led Zep IV or Zoso) is
an exception, but most
bands hit a rut in the
mid-career stage. Col-
lective Soul seems to be
caughtin one right now.
In several places on the
new album, it seems
they are really trying to
sound good. They no
longer follow where the
music leads them. That
strained effort makes
some songs worse. This
effort also makes one or
two other songs just
suck. The album does
have some redeeming
qualities. “Run,” forex-

ample, is a great sing-along song, while “Needs”
includes one of Ed Roland’s more impressive
vocal performances. However, most of the album
sounds dreadfully like a cover album — a cover,
essentially, of themselves.

So I am disappointed by the effort. That’s no

big deal. It may be time for Collective Soul to look
in a new direction.

That encourages me. I need to break out of
my monotonous existence and venture into undis-
covered country. I hear that Lotus 28 has a great
beef dish.
