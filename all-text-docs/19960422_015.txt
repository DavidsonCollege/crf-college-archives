Life is sport
drink it up

By Davin MortLock
Sports Columnist

Oh how true this Gatorade
commercial rings. Goals, com-
petition, success, failure, deter-
mination, drive, obstacles. These
represent only a few of the many
characteristics that mesh together
‘| to create such a unique bond. -

Yet the line between life
and sports is hard to define, Too
much of one thing is bad for
another, and toolittle of one thing
might also be bad. Or it might be
good. And it is these boundaries
that every athlete in sports, and

every person in life, must deter- |

mine in order to succeed.

Yet the key to this catchy
Gatorade ad is that once you
accept that such a coexistence
between life and sports is meta-
physically present, and whether
ornot your boundaries are clearly
defined, then it is necessary to
“Drink it Up.”

While Quaker Oats Inc. is
trying to convince people to
“Drink Gatorade Up” they have
unintentionally created an alter-
nate and more important mes-
sage, “Drink Life Up.”

But one can’t do so without
understanding the connection
‘|made in the commercial’s first
line: “Life is a Sport.” Because it
is sports that teach one how to
deal- with, life’s characteristics.
How to work with other people.
How to work alone. How to deal
with opponents, pressure, disci-
pline, obstacles, goals, defeat,
and success. It is sports that teach
how to Drink Life Up.

But what makes sports so
special is. that it also takes you
away from life. Time spent play-
ing basketball, baseball, tennis,
golf, swimming, oreven riding a
horse or playing cards represents
an escape from the life’s natural
stress.

Yet a healthy escape be-
cause they don’t make us lose
control of mind or.body. So
while sports allow us to forget
about life for a short period of
time, they also reinvigorate hope
and confidence.

The problem with sports is
that for most of us, they are not a
natural gift. And as we become
adults, it becomes more difficult
to begin or continue. We be-
come more aware of our weak-
nesses. Playing with people who
are much better than you is a
humbling and often intimidating
experience. An experience that
causes people to turn away from
sports,

But while this is happen-
ing, life doesn’t getany less com-
plicated and the mysteries that
surround it aren’t suddenly
solved.

So don’t turn sports away.
Don’t be intimidated. Don’t give
up. Go out there and play. Play
anything. Sweat, struggle, learn.

Life is about sports. Drink
It Up.

Power-packed Quattlebaum bombs away

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

Hard-hitting third baseman
Gus Quattlebaum boasts a rich
baseball background.

A product of Andover (Mass.)
Little League, one of the state’s
traditional baseball bastions, and a
three-year letterman at Andover’s
Phillips Academy, he garnered All-
New England honors as a junior
and senior.

During his three-year MVP

American Legion career, Andover

lost four games.

“Andover has always had
strong baseball. That’s shaped me
into the player that I am today,”
said Quattlebaum, “We had some
great coaching, from Little League
on up. I think it’s paid off for me.”

But at the end of high school,
that pay off was uncertain. Shoul-
der surgery following his senior
year worried many schools, while
top-notch academic and baseball
programs, including Davidson,

were scared of his suspect board
scores.

But Dean of Admission Nancy
Cable granted Quattlebaum a per-
sonal interview, and liked what
she saw and heard.

Said head coach Dick Cooke,
“He liked her. She liked him. It
seemed like a good match.”

“She sort of overlooked the
board scores and took into consid-
eration what kind of a person I

was,” said Quattlebaum, a History ~

major.

“She gave me achance. She’s -

the reason why I’m here, and I’m
more than grateful.”

And so is Cooke. Although
the team stands at 14-30, the coach
has seen Quattlebaum fulfill his
immense potential this spring.

After hitting .311 during his
first two collegiate campaigns,
Quattlebaum has exploded this
year. His .308 batting clip trails
only outfielder Luke Goodwin’s
.333, and he leads the squad in
homeruns (12), runs (44), slug-

ging (.662), walks (37), and on-
base %(.483).

"He’s a very patient, selec-
tive, knowledgeable hitter,” said
Cooke.

Last year, .Quattlebaum
torched ACC pitching for a .481
average, three homers, seven runs,
and seven RBIs in seven contests.

His ACC mastery continued
in the Wildcats’ Apr. 3 upset at
Duke, as he collected three hits
(including his eighth homer), a
walk, and three RBIs.

The shocker was Davidson’s
first victory over aranked foe since
they stunned #1 Ga. Tech in 1994,

Quattlebaum, who cracked his
twentieth career homer on Satur-
day, could challenge the school’s
all-time mark of 38 next year.

This summer, Quattlebaum
will play for Chatham in the Cape
Cod (Mass.) League, a renowned
pipeline to the pros primarily
funded by Major League Baseball.

Cooke believes this will pro-

Quattlebaum on his way to bigger
and better post-Davidson opportu-
nities on the diamond.

“It is a great summer baseball
league that will get him some good
exposure against some of the top
competition in the nation. His of-
fensive productivity is what’s go-
ing to get him the opportunity (to -
play professional baseball).”

But now Quattlebaum and the
Wildcats must take care of unfin-
ished Southern Conference busi-
ness, namely next weekend’s
league tourney in Charleston, SC.

Two years ago, as league door-
mat, Davidson toppled Western
and Ga. Southern, the top two seeds,
on successive days.

The team hopes they can do
the same this year. We've cer-
tainly showed signs that we can
play competitively, and I think
everybody in the league feels that
way too,” said Cooke.

Said Quattlebaum, “It’s all
about which team gets hot at the
