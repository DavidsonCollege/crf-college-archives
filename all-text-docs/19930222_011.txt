and, in a crowd, launched his 25-
foot shot with seven seconds to go.
The ball bounded off the rim and
seemed headed off, but came back
down and somehow rattled in.
Davidson called timeout at :03.
The Wildcats’ set play out of the
timeout worked perfectly, except
for the shot. Heuer’sinbounds pass
found Williams at halfcourt, and

he passed to Zimmerman at the top’

of the key. His three-pointer to tie
the game bounced deep off the rim.
Davidson’s offense was rela-
tively effective throughout, and
Detlef Musch led five players in
double figures with 20 points and
15 rebounds. But when they needed
to, the ‘Cats never found a way to
stop Ross, who answered every
Davidson surge. The last ‘of those
came at aboutthe six-minute mark,
when Heuer scored on the low
block, assisted by Jeff Anderson,
for a 69-65 Davidson lead. But
Ross hita three-pointer 12 seconds
later to make it 69-68, and_ the
game went down to the wire.
“We justlet Ross get too many
looks at the basket,” said Davidson
coach Bob McKillop. “It’s really
disappointing because we put our-
selves in a position to win and
didn’t close the door.”
Wednesday night’s game at
UT-Chattanooga hinged on the
ejection of the Mocs’ Gary Robb
midway through the second half.
Spurred by a home crowd angry
over Robb’s dismissal, the Mocs
(20-6, 13-2) erased a five-point
Davidson lead, took a small lead of
their own, and took a 95-80 win

with free throws down the stretch.

Robb’s downfall began with
the Wildcats up 51-47 with 12:28
left. UTC point guard Tim Brooks
madea three-pointer to make it 51-
50, and after the shot was knocked
down by Robb, who claimed to
have been pushed. Robb vented
his frustration by first fouling and
then shoving the ‘Cats’ Chris
Alpert to draw one technical foul,
and then cursing out the referee to
get a second (an automatic ejec-
tion).

Narat made all four technical
free throws to give Davidson a 65-
60 advantage, butby then youcould
see it coming. The crowd, feeling
its team to be the victim of a gross
injustice, had worked itself into a
frenzy, and swept the UTC players
with it. On the game’s next four
possessions, the Wildcats were
called for two offensive and two
defensive fouls. The Mocs tied the
game on Tee Jay Jackson’s three-
pointplay.and Brandon Born’stwo
foul shots.

Bom’s steal and dune at 6:55
completed a 12-2 run and gave
UTCa69-62 lead that proved to be
enough. Narat, who finished with
a game-high 24, got Davidson
within 81-75 on a baseline jumper
with 1:22 left, but then the ‘Cats
were forced to foul to stop the
clock, and the Mocs (75% from the
line as a team) didn’t crack. In all,
UTC hit 14 of 14 foulshots in the
last 1:34.

Davidson shot 58% from the
field and 82% from the line (14-
17), and got effective games from

Women's Tennis Preview

By Patrick Jopling
The Davidson women’s ten-
nis team began its eighteenth sea-

; . son last weekend with the Wildcat

Doubles Classic at Knobloch Ten-
nis Center. Caroline Price’s team
is returning all of its top six players
from last year’s Big South Confer-
ence Runner-Up squad, and they
look to make their re-entrance into
the Southern Conference a suc-
cessful one.

_. Leading the Cats will be jun-
ior Cindy Hess, who has occupied
the top spot of the Davidson lineup
since her arrival here three years

its top three scorers. Musch scored
21 and Zimmerman 15. So despite
the loss, McKillop was pretty
pleased. “I thoughtwe played pretty
darn well,” he said. “Our effort
was outstanding, our execution was
good. I was delighted with our
performance.”

For UTC coach Mack
McCarthy, Robb’s ejection and its
aftermath was the difference. “I
don’t know if we win without that.
We really turned it up, thanks to
the crowd, in response to Gary
getting ejected,”he said.

Davidson, 9-4 at Belk Arena
after the lossto Appalachian, closed
its home season yesterday against
East Tennessee State. It concludes
its regular season next weekend at
Marshall and VMI.:Entering
Sunday’s game, the Wildcats were
clinging to a fifth-place tie in the
conference standings. A top-six
finish is of vital importance, since
the bottom four teams must par-
ticipate in a play-in round to ad-

vance to the conference tourna--

ment itself.

of the East Tennessee St. Game.

ago. Her mental toughness and
consistency make her one of the
top players in the entire confer-
ence. Hess will play number one
singles and team up with sopho-
more Kimberley Nance to play
number one doubles as well.
Nance’s power is a perfect compli-
ment to Hess’ game, and it makes
these two a tough team to beat.
Nance also looks to make an im-
pact in the singles lineup.

Talented juniors Jennifer
Beahm and Tasha Ruth give Coach
Price experience and emotional
leadership. The final two members
of last year’s top six include sopho-
more Nicole Wilcox and junior
Barbara Grooms. Wilcox won a
conference title and had a 30+ vic-
tory season at number five singles
last year.

Adding to this depth are new-
comers Susannah Cobb and Sarah
Heer. Cobb is a transfer from
Peace College, a junior college
powerhouse, and Heer is a top
freshman from Zurich, Switzer-
land. Both of these women have a
strong chance of cracking the top
six, and the combination of these

eight players give Coach Price
numerous options going into
Southern Conferencecompetition.

The team to beat is Furman.
The Paladins beat Davidson hand-
ily last year, but look for this year’s
match to be muchcloser. The Wild-
cats appear to be a close second in
the preseason poll. The other
schools that could make a run at
the title are an improved Marshall
team and East Tennessee State.

The 1984 women’s team at
Davidson won the Division III na-
tional championship and this team
is potentially stronger. Southern
Conference competition is tougher
than Division III competition, and
the Wildcats have a chance at the
title. The dedication and talent of
this team could make it one of
Davidson’s best ever.

The final element in the
women’s tennis team is new assis-
tant coach John Beyer. Beyer
graduated last year after starring
for four years for the men’s team.
His tennis acumen and insight
should help the team considerably
as they shoot for a Southern Con-
ference Championship.

EAST TENNESSEE STATE .

In the last home game for
Davidson senior basketball play-
ers, they played inspired and
