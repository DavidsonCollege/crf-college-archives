Holland Hopeful
As Games Start

By STEVE CROSS
Asst. Copy Editor
Basketbali Coach Terry
Holland, at Open End the
night before the Furman
game, assured assembled
students and fans
we'll be a great ball team.”
Holland emphasized, how-
ever, that the boys would
need to play several games

to get working together

right. »
Holland said that the

Wildcats. have a tough

schedule this year, and that
“‘Furman has the best team
Vve ever seen from = Fur-
man.’ Richmond, William
and Mary, South Carolina,
VPI, and Saint John’s will
be good competition, Hol-
land said,. and ‘George
Washington's a definite con-
tender. East Carolina has
almost everybody back.”

Asked about the players,
Holland said ‘‘Adrian’s de-
fense has improved 200 per
cent. He's got only 200 per
cent to go.’ He characteriz
ed DeMoisey as ‘‘a good
shooter.”

This year's freshman

team, Holland observed, is
“a better than average
team for Davidson."’ It is

coached by Bo Brickles.

‘Holland expressed no sur
prise at the sixth-in-the- na
tion rating Davidson has re-
ceived from ‘Sports Illus-
trated."" Nonetheless, he
conceded, the team lost a
great deal when Dave
Moser and Wayne Huckel
graduated.

tions, Holland named Jan

EPC Resigns,
Faculty Exams Vote

By GRAY WILSON
Staff Writer

The Educational Policy
Committee, in response to the
blunt rejection of its pro-
posals on area exams, has
tendered its resignation to
the faculty.

In a memorandum releas-
ed last week, the EPC stat-
ed its belief that it was not
a representative committee
of the faculty and was there-
fore not fulfilling its proper
role.

One intent of the resig-
nation is to instruct the fac-
ulty in its consideration of
policy. Reference is ,made
specifically to the meeting
on November 11, when the
faculty dismissed the EPC
proposals with little notice.

The committee asserts
that “recommendations on
very complex and vital is-
sues, when based upon hon-
est and open
numerous individual contacts,

An electronic optical
scanner, a device | which
reads pencil marks on pa-
per and converts the _ in-
formation into computer
cards, will be added to Da-
vidson College's data pro-

The device, known as an
OpScan 100 DC, manufac
tured by the Optieal Scann-
ing Corporation, will feed
the college’s new NCR Cen-

tury 100 System computer.
Both will be installed by
Aug. 1, 1970.

“The sky is the limit for

erations. “By cutting cut

discussions, -

extended periods of thought,
informed experience — and
conscientious effort, deserve
thorough and open hearings

rather than total rejection
in summary fashion.”
The resignation was also

promoted by a parliamentary
reason. “If any deliberative
body is to function properly
through a committee © struc-
ture, there must be mutual
trust, confidence, and respect
between that body and its
committees.”

“But when ‘a delibervive
body disposes of; ittee

much as a debate on. the
issues of that recommenda-
tion, and does so by a Very
large majority, it becomes
obvious that the necessary
trust, confidence, and re-
spect are absent, and the
vote is a vote of no confi-

dence,’ the EPC resignation
Stated.

The committee closed its
statement with a pledge of
support for the new com-
mittee.

Professor James Fred
ericksen had some reser-

vations about the resignation,
but his doubts were of a
technical nature.
Richard Cowart is the
dissenting member of the
