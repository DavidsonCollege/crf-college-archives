Just Average Guys emerge preseason victors

By QUINN McCUTCHEN
Despite the inclement
weather caused by Hurricane
Hugo, the 1989 IMAC flicker-
ball and indoor soccer seasons
are well under way.
Unfortunately,recordkeeping
from these games is rather in-
complete thanks to a rash of
forfeits and postponements
caused. by the hurricane
(added to the fact that many
teams forgot to turn in their
scorecards). Here
is an incomplete record of the
1989 flickerball and soccer sea-
sons:

On the sports front

O.K., O.K.-I’m sorry

_ ByJOHN BURNS
This Monday, as I was taking a
left by the equipment room to go
play racquetball, I was startled to
hear my name called in a rather fran-
tic way by a good friend of mine.
“You better watch’ yourself

around here,” she said witha note of.

tension, “the women's coaches are
‘maaaaad at you.”

That washow Ibecame aware of
a rather large mistake on my part.
Whileagonizing over whether or not
to take any of the ebullient, sardonic
sarcasm out of Mark Puckett’s col-
umn (I decided not to), and whether
or not would get an IMAC writer (I
did), I completely and inexcusably
omitted women’s sports from my
section. ;

I, John Burns, being of reasona-

bly sound mind and desperately
sleepy body, do hereby officially
apologize to all the dedicated ath-
letes and coaches who were of-
fended by this mistake. Please ac-
cept my humblestapologies.

It wasin no way my intention to

_belittle the vibrant women’s athlet-

ics program here at Davidson. Our

smost successful team so far is.the

field hockey team, which has beaten
many tough opponents, and played
others to the limit. The women’s
soccer team is showing great im-
provement and the volleyball team
is dealing witha young lineupanda
near-impossible schedule very well.

Thirty-five percent of the var-
sity athletes at Davidson are
women. The importance of these

‘Lady Wildcats squeeze

past Cobras at end, 3-2

By SPIDER WORMUTH
The women’s soccer team im-
proved its record to 2-5 Monday with
a 3-2 victory.

Following losses to Randolph-
Macon and Elon, the Wildcats
bounced back in a tight contest with
the Coker Cobras. At the eleven min-

ute mark in the first half, Maria.

Tucker opened the scoring for
Davidson witha goal off a cross pass
from Ann Todd.

In the second half, after Coker

had scored the equalizer, Liz Clarke
scored off a direct kick to make the
score 2-1. The Cobras again tied the
score late in the half ona breakaway.
The Wildcats finally overcame
Coker on a goal by Annie Adams
with less than two minutes remain-
ing. - .
The Lady ‘Cats return home to
play their second and. third home
games this weck, taking-on St. An-

‘drews on Wednesday at 4:00 and

Queens on Saturday at noon.

programs cannot be overstated.
