“OUR PIONEERING WO

They gave the express rider a good start

Henry Wells, developing the mail and ex-
press business of Wells Fargo, knew the neces-
sity of careful preparation andalertmanagement.
Commun.cation was more than the picturesque
racing of pony express riders; behind the scenes
there was alwaysthe systematic planningof routes,
the watchful inspection of outposts and men.

Communication today is immeasurably faster

than it was then, thanks to electricity. And to
a vastly greater degree has the work of prepa-
ration behind the scenes become important.

In the Bell System, management must con-
stantly look ahead to provide the sinews of ser-
vice against growing public demand—material
and men must -be mobilized to extend and
keep open the lines of communication.
