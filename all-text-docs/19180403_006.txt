The DAVIDSONIAN April 3, 1918

“PATRONIZE OUR
ADVERTISERS”

Some time ago this verse appeared in
THe Davipsonian:

“The college paper’s a wonderful in-
vention.

The college gets all the fame,

The ‘printer gets all the money;

But the staff gets all the blame.”

If there is any fame—if anything has
been accomplished by our paper, we
want the college to be the recipient of
good results, and the blame—the staff is
willing to bear that, and we are willing
to give the money to the printer (for it
is deserved) but what is the source of
the money? It comes from the blanket
fee and subscriptions, our natural source
of income; one of our friends gave us
$100; the student body co-operated with
the paper by increasing the blanket fee
portion for Tre Davinsontan 25 cents
per man; our advertisers, by the end of
the session, will have paid nearly $400,
about one-third the cost of publication
for the year! Readers, we want you to
have a paper that pleases you; we want
the college to get the fame; the printer,
the money; the staff, the blame; and our
advertisers to get your patronage, for
your sake, their sake, and Tain Davin-

VIRGINIA CLUB ENJOYS
A BI-ENNIAL BANQUET

The Virginia Club held their bi-an-
nual banquet last “Thursday night at 9
o’clock at the residence of Mrs. N. ‘LT.
Smith. A delightful five-course supper
was served by Mrs. Smith, in which
nothing of tastefulness was lacking. Aft-
er the banquet a jovial gathering of the
Virginians was held in the parlor of her
home, where the old Virginia spirit was
manifested abundantly.

The club was entertained by an ad-
dress from Prof. W. W. Wood, who
is a native of Charlottesville, Va., and
Dr. J. B. Wonds, who has recently re-
turned from China and also claims Vir-
ginia as his home. A delightful address
was given by J. R. Woods, and W. P.
Cumming with M. B. Heizer brought
up the rear with entertaining addresses
on the appropriate subject, “Why I Love
Virginia.” D. M. Orgain, who is pres-
ident of the club, was toastmaster for
the evening and made the occasion a
very interesting one thru his play on
words. Jokes were told in abundance,
the most appropriate was probably the
one on the limping professor.

The banquet was attended by sixteen
members. It welcomed the two hon-
ored guests of the evening, Dr. Woods
and Professor Wood. Also it was for-
tunate in having a general in attend-
ance—“General” Hall, of Georgia
Dorm. .

The evening was ended with a vote of
thanks to Mrs. Smith, who had so taste-
fully made the occasion a cheerful one,
and to Mrs, Saunders. who so kindly
decorated the place cards for the even-
ing with red and black; and also to the
committee on the banquet which made
the occasion possible; after which the
club retired to the parlor and officers
were elected for the ensuing year, as fol-
lows: G. P. Scott, president; K. B.
McCutcheon, vice-president; J. E. Cas-
sell, secretary and treasurer, and P. B.
Carwile, banquet manager.

THE PEOPLE ARE SAVING.

The English have not been considered
a saving nation, and one of the most
notable examples of the effect of patriot-
ism ona whole people was the fact that
during the year 1916, altho purchasing
billions of dollars of war bonds, the
small savings. banks depositors in Eng-
land increased their deposits over $60.-
000,000.

The patriotic appeal to the American
people for war savings has met with a
similar response. Statistics for the year
1917 are not yet available, but reports
.from various sections of the United
States indicate that membership and as-
sets in co-operative building, or savings
and loan associations, increased at least
10 per cent, the same rate of increase for
the year 1916 and about the average rate
of increase for the last ten years.

The small savings bank accounts show
a similar increase in numbers of deposit-
ors and amounts of deposits. Sales of
War Savings Stamps also show a great
growth of the habit of saving.
