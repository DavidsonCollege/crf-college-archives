CAGERS WIN THRILLING GAME
FROM CAROLINA

vidson Cagers Defeat White Phantoms

A new year and a new spirit has
pervaded «the traditional atmos-
phere of our college. Optimism and
enthusiasm has replaced the cus-
tomary aloofness of Wildcat cage
followers. Early in the season we
predicted great things for Coach
Laird’s charges and they have not
only lived up to them but have sur-
passed them, - The huge crowd
present will attest the brilliance
of the Cats, and those who chose

to arrive after the freshman game

started either stood up the whole
game or were unable to procure
tickets.

ing nullified the smooth passing
game of the  highly-touted Tar

The pace is furious in the whole
conference~ and the scramble will
end in the pay-off to only eight
teams—a berth on the tournament

at Raleigh.

While talking to Gene cawike
who, by the way, although young
in years, is president of two base-
ball leagues this year, I was shown
a contract signed by our own Chet
Coach Chapman will
serve as umpire this summer
either the North State or Carolina
League. Coach McEver is also be-
ing talked for one of these jobs.

games are slated for the Charlotte

Huge Stadium

How about that stadium
posed for our nation’s capital? It’s
good reasoning to build a stadium
instead of just another memorial,
but a structure to seat 300,000 peo-
ple is a horse of another color.

The at State

situation. Anderson was not of-

Flashy Forward

Here is Maurice Peabody,
Stellar Cat forward who led
the attack against the Tar
Heels Saturday. Last season he
was shifted from guard and has
done so well at forward that
now he is one of the main cogs
in the best cage that
Davidson has boasted in some
time.
