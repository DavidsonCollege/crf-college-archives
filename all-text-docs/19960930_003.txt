Jasper’s debuts
on Depot Street

By JoHn DuNwoopy
Staff Writer

Wednesday evening marked
the grand opening of Jasper’s, lo-
cated on Depot street on the former
site of Back Street Café. If crowd
size is any indication of future suc-
cess, then Jasper’s full house that
night is a great sign.

Owner Dale Metzler was en-
thused by the grand opening. Over
the Homecoming weekend, guests
arrived to find the restaurant full.

He states, “Usually grand
openings start out really slow and
seem to .wane on. That was not
how it was this past Wednesday;
we started out strong and contin-
ued on throughout the evening.”

One reason for Jasper’s initial
success could be its elegant atmo-
sphere.

trustee
committees

Sophomore Rives Moore and -

senior Nelson Chandler will each
serve on a trustee committee, posts
Student Government Association
president Warren Buford calls “the
highest level of student represen-
tation.”

Moore and Chandler were

nominated by the SGA’s Trustee -

Committee Member Selection
Committee, chaired by senior
Chrissie Hudson. SGA senators
Lara Burkholder, Saad Gul, Steinen
Gerla, and John Hutzley also served
-on the committee, conducting in-
terviews with eleven candidates.
No freshmen expressed interest in
the trustee committee positions. -

Moore was nominated for
membership in the Trustee Ad-
mission and Financial Aid Com-
mittee, and Chandler was nomi-
nated to serve on the Trustee Build-
ing and Grounds Committee. Both
nominations were approved by the
Senate.

Moorereplaces Missy Graves,
whose membership in the Admis-
sion and Financial Aid Committee
ended when she graduated last
spring. Charidler fills a vacancy
created by recent graduate
Katherine Hash, who served onthe
Building and Grounds Commit-
tee.

_ Mooreand Chandler will meet
with their five-member Trustee
Committees for several hours on
October 3 and again on February
3.

Seniors Buford, Clair Free-
man, and Will Cowan serve as
student representatives on the
trustee committees for Council on
Campus and Religious Life, Ath-
letic Policy, and Institutional Ad-
vancement, respectively.

Campus-wide elections to se-
lect next year’s student representa-
tives will be held in January.

Metzler hopes “that Jasper’s
can become part of the Davidson
family.”

Right now, Jasper’s is open
for lunch and dinner but the
Metzlers hope to be open for break-
fast starting January 1.

More additions are on the way.
Metzler wants to have completed a
brand new bar ajoining the restau-
rant to the left, also in January.

To the right of Jasper’s, a bak-
ery and pastry shop is being
built,which should be open this
coming February.

In the spring, a canopy will be
installed over the terrace for out-
door dining with views of an en-
closed garden.

With 35 years invested in the
food service industry, Metzler also
hopes to expand into the banquet-

ing business in the coming year.
