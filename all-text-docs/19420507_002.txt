On Smith’s Return

We. were glad to note last we that
the government has seen fit to de Menate
Shaw Smith indespensible to Davidson
College and to allow him to continue in
his post as Y. M. C. A, Secretary here.

Although many know Shaw’s duties,
few students realize the extent of his ac-
tivities performed informally through-
out the community. He has become one
of the school’s most valuable advertising
agents through his relations with guests
visiting the campus. Few speakers
have left without commenting on the

attention accorded them:--=------——

His cheerful personality canbe
found accompanying his energetic per-
son on his nightly rounds through the
dormitories long after every midnight,
helping all he can and rejuvinating
those he cannot.

According to his cabinet, he has
proven one of the best organizers ever
to hold the secretaryship. He not only
keeps_up_with_the campus_scene_but_he
is completely ‘informed on all phases of
worldwide) Y. M. C. A. work.

Jim Owens, retiring Y. M. C. A.
President, sums up Smith’s influence
on the campus by describing him “a

“living example of a practieat Chris-

tian.”

On Spencer’s Talk

Lt. Spencer’s talk in chapel Monday
rates with the best of the year. our

“opinion it rates with the best of a num-

ber of years. Few people could’ have
handled stich a-subject with the tact and
finesse evidenced by that speaker.

For those who missed the service
mentioned, the Lieutenant called the
attention of the students to the reputa-
tion which Davidson men had ‘acquired
in every part of the country,

He emphasiged the fact, however,
that it was away from Davidson that
this reputation has been upheld and he
advised that students show some of the
discretion at school that they evidently
exhibit away from the campus.

The most encouraging note in the
talk was the report dated.1892 proving
that 642 windows were smashed during

a snow siege that year. We hope that—
will-not-constitute’a-record at which-to
shoot next winter, however.

Near Ed.:

‘American people for the past generation have

SOME MODEST PROPOSALS:

The Davidson student body, for all its advan-

tages over most other student bodies, has many,
many problems, most of which have been hashed
and re-hashed to the point of triteness.

Greatest among these, is as well we all know,

the problem of dances on campus. Perhaps Fate
has solved this snare of delusion or at least set
it aside for the duration, &

3e that as it may, a new monster has recently
reared its ugly head among us—the problems of
what to do with the sunny Sunday afternoons that
May is so busily lavishing upon our fair campus
these days.

Of course there are boys who seldom see this
fair Campus on Sunday afternoons. Let's dismiss
them with our blessings and a envious sigh and
try to find some profitable avocation “for those
unfortunates who, for one reason or another, find

themselves at headquarters on a sultry Sabbath.

For obvious reasons, we must dispense with all
forms of activity involving either noise or com-
petition, or both. That is to say, we must not
show any outward signs of enjoying whatever we
do.

Studying, except for those few rare genni who
still possess'an abundance of ambition, is definitely
out. Who wants to sit indoors over a book when
all outdoors is literally saturated with indispen-
sible vitamin D?

Sunbathing, in the areas prescribed for such
activity, is popular, but it has its disadvantages.
Many of us who lack the sufficient stimulus to
make us study are still,too restless to find ‘satis-
faction in lying motionless under Old Sol by the
hour, and a combination of trying to study and
sun at the same time can have disastrous effects
on the peepers. '

Chasing butterflies could hardly offend anybody
perhaps the butterflies. Some folks,
however, might consider such activity a bit beneath

Beta Theta Pi

Chapter scattered throughout Vir-
ginia, Kentucky, North and South

To insure filthier filth and more
of it three illustrious embryonic
seniors will this week. serve as the
newer and younger talent spoken
of previously by an ex-ghost doper.
After hair tearing and cerebrum
clashing we have finally decided
that these few tasty bits of table
tripe will keep you chewing for at
least a week.

BOB AMOS has been elected
dupe of the week, and from all in-
dications he will probably have to
serve a year or so in Alcatraz for
neglecting his post during the recent
blackout — the~-cause~ being ISA-
BELLE LINKER. And he is sup-
posed to be one of Davidson's few
“married” men. SOUTHGATE
JONES has decided what he will
do after the duration, he wants to
continue his brief but
lasting acquaintance with a certain
young art student up NYC way.

One of the rare Twiddling Twot-
ter Trotters of the Davidson cam-
pus, FRED MORTON, journeyed
down to Atlanta to see SEXY
PREXY SANDIFER'’S old fire. A
dozen or so limber Sigmas went to
Wrightsville to show THE HEAD
BREWER the brimy deep. Now he
has run the total of existing Ken-
tuckians ever to see the ocean to
ten. Pretty awful wasn't it—it just
shows you what little material we
have to work with,
