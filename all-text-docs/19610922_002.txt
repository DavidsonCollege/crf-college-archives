THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Wandering In The Wilderness

Dean Frontis Johnston began the
1-2-5 Club program in Charlotte this
week with Dean Rusk’s comment on
Davidson during his 1950 visit: “It’s
like returning to the Old Testament.”

The topic under 1-2-5 discussion
was Davidson, An International Col-
lege.

Increasing numbers of Davidson
students are showing interest in study
overseas. The past few years have
seen Davidsonians in many European
universities and even Africa and Asia.
The Richardson Scholarships have
populated the campus with foreign
students for several years.

Faculty. administration and stud-.
ents generally give lip service to “an
international college.”

Davidson is certainly less provin-
cial) now than a few years ago. We
maintain that we are living under a
New Commandment. But, in reality
our students abroad and foreign
students here must still struggle a-
gainst the most pharisaical of admin-
istrative detail.

The college gives no encourage-
ment to students interested in inter-
national study. There are only the
barest attempts at the dissemination
of information on the departmental
level. If a student manages to seek ad-
mission to a foreign university on his
own initiative, academic, living and
travel conditions are destined to .re-
main a mystery until he steps onto
foreign soil.

Adequate academic advice to the
prospective foreign student is practi-
cally non-existent. Since the standard
procedures of credit transferral do not
always apply, the student receives no

assurance that his work will be accred-
ited. Students on scholarship are un-
able to use their stipends for foreign
study.

The prevailing ignorance about for-
eign education not only hampers the
prospective student but endangers the
academic standards of Davidson,
which must often work in the dark in
evaluating credits taken abroad.

If by negligence we restrain our
students from study in foreign coun-
tries, a petty over-watchfulness ser-
iously reduces the effectiveness of in-
ternational students on the Davidson
campus.

Foreign students naturally want to
become acquainted with all aspects of
American life, not just Chambers and
their dormitories. They cannot be of
service to us unless they know Ameri-
ca well and unless they have ample
time to participate in our activities,
lead discussions or just sit down over
a cup of coffee.

By insisting on a strict adherance to
attendance regulations intended for
the native student and by other un-
necessary hindrances and demands on
the time of foreign students, the col-
lege limits the opportunity of our
foreign students to “internationalize”
Davidson. A sluggard program for
organizing foreign student participa-
tion in forums, discussions, and other
has not helped the situation.

Even if we allow the Public Rela-
tions Office a certain degree of poetic
license, the gap between Dean Rusk’s
Old Testament institution and an “in-
ternational college” is still disappoint-

ingly ‘great. LK

The Scheduling Committee
Can Still Redeem Itself

Why doesn’t the faculty's com-
mittee on Academic Scheduling make
up a permanent exam schedule?

Every semester since we can re-
member Dr. Drake and his committee
have run up against constant opposi-
tion to their efforts. And he has a lot
of problems to contend with (See arti-
cle on this page). Then, too, every
semester Mr. Hengeveld’s office is
plagued with demands for schedule
changes. Many students complain of
having three or four exams in a row,
while others go for three or four days
without any exams scheduled.

Second semester exams have al-
ways run eight days. First semester
exams also took eight days until the
faculty three years ago decided in
favor of a two-day break between Sse-
mesters. These two days were taken,
from the first semester exam period.

This year the faculty, by a very
slim margin, restored the two days.
Some need two extra days, they say,
to grade papers and prepare final
grades. The students like the added
time, too, some say—it gives them
more time to study.

We would like to see both the stud-
ents and the professors satisfied. But
we personally feel that six days is
ample for first semester exams, es-
pecially if an extra day can be thrown
in at the beginning of the period for
reading and preparing.

One solution can be worked out
this year: reduce the exam period to
six days and add the two extra days to
the semester anyway, since classes
will end on a Saturday and exams will
begin on a Monday. And we are will-
ing to bet the students and faculty
would approve of two extra days of
vacation.

If the professors need extra time to
grade papers, wouldn’t they rather
have those days after exams were
over? This would still give them a
chance to get away for a short vaca-
tion themselves.

Of course such a solution may not
be possible in future years. We are

not campaigning for a four-day se-
mester break. The two extra days
might well be restored to the summer
vacation, pushing ahead the opening
date of school.

We see the need to establish a per-
manent exam schedule for each se-
mester which would be the result of a
thorough comparison of the number of
students involved in each hour, the
number of sections taking the test,
etc. Every four or five years the
schedule would have to be reexamin-
ed, but the permanency would appeal
to students and faculty alike.

Accompanying this proposal is a
continued plea to the registrar’s of-
fice to permit more section-switching
and individual schedule-changing. No
system can treat all students fairly,
and the individual deserves a chance
to do as well ag his fellows on each
exam.

Ideally, each student should be able
to arrange an exam schedule for him-
self by conference with his professors,

Since we are not vet this advanced,
a six-day exam schedule for first
semester exams, based on thorough
study, and put on a permanent basis,
is a most reasonable solution. BS

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Papra Slashes Honor System;
Demands Sweeping Changes

Dear Editor:

The Honor System at David-
son needs a great deal of re-
vision. The cruelty and blind-
ness of its penalties demand it,
as well as the fact that the
Honor Court has no deterrent
value.

The Honor Court sets a merci-
less precedent by refusing to
accept extenuating  circums-
tances in its judgements.

Fear has no deterrent value.
In Monday's assembly, we heard
about one student who was pres-
sured into cheating; a s udent
who until then was judged hon-
est. Did ‘fear of punishment
deter him? Did fear deter the
others who cheated. lied. ete.?

The implication is that we arc
animals who kosw io vse

basis for compliance with rules
than fear. At this same assem-
bly, we were told that offenses
are committed because the will
to refrain is overwhelmed by
the need to commit the offense.

The offender is punished for
what he could not help doing.
Prevention would be more de-
sirable than punishment.

On a different level, the prob
lem of capital punishment has
iNustrated that fear is no de-
rerrent. In England, public
hangings of pickpockets (done
tyr deterrent values) were abol-
ishe:l bécause too many pockets
wers picked at these hangings.
lt is not the horror of the pun-
ishment but the certainty of
punishment which deters.

‘Lhe penalties which the Hon-

er Court inflicts are . too

Mansei! Explains

Y Purpose,

BY FRANK. MANSELL
YMCA President’

The Davidson. College Y.M.-
C.A. seeks to witness the Chris-
tian faith in the communities
of the college, the nation, and
the world. It is committed to
service through positive action
as well as worship and study.

Every person in the college
community, whether students or
members of the faculty or ad-
ministration, who is interested
in and who is willing to work
within the provisions of a pro-
gram based on this purpose, is
invited to participate in the
activities of the Y.M.C.A.

These activities will be cen-
tered in the same basic areas of
interest as they were last year.
Increased emphasis will be put
on the areas of International
Relations and Social Life, two
aspects of the program which
have been slighted in previous
years.

A full program of community
service is planned. Students will
be working with the scouts and
athletic teams, in the ‘teen can-
teen, and in the recreational
programs of the local schools.
Students will also be teaching
Sunday School at Barium
Springs each Sunday as well as
supplying nearby pulpits and
working with youth gropus in
the churches. .

Whereas these areas of the
Y.M.C.A.’s work are limited in
the number of students they can
employ, other areas encourage
as many persons as care to par-
ticipate. The area of Spiritual
Life invites all members of the
college community to attend de
votional chapel services each

Plans

Wednesday and Friday morning
at 19:20 in Lingle Chapel. Also,
student prepared. private devo-
tional material will soon be
made available to the student
body.

All college personnel are
urged to attend the various
forums and discussions during
the year which will feature
outstanding guests on our cam-
pus as well as members of our
own college family. The high-
light of this series will be the
Book-of-the-Year program next
spring.

The Y.M.C.A. depends on the
members of the college com:
munity to participate in these
various aspects of its program
and to support the work through
voluntary financial gifts. With-
out your support in both of
these ways, the Y. M. C. A. on
the Davidson campus can never
carry out the purpose for which
it exists.

All of the activities of the
Y.M.C.A. are made available to
you in order that you have an
opportunity to voluntarily en-
gage in worship, study, and
positive action within the con-
text of the Christian faith. You
are encouraged to take advan-
tage of these opportunities dur-
ing this school year.

harsh, too severe, and too per-
manent. It approximates the
“A” on the adulteress'’s shoul-
der. ,

Another fault of the Honor
Court is that it has taken upon
itself the duty of interpreting
the spirit of these laws. Thus
they gave themselves unlimited
authority.

The reason for having laws
defined was for the protection
of the innocent, so thet they
could not be groundiessly pun-
ished. This idea of interpreting
the spirit of the faw has no
precedent in Law; the Judicial
System may not interpret the
spirit of the law in America.

Yet, the Honor Court has
taken this right, even without
due process of majority vote on
the matter.

I propose certain revisions in
the Court and in the system.
Stealing offenses should be
brought .to the attention of the
criminal courts, where such of:-
fenses belong.

Those found guilty of cheat-
ing by the court should auto:
matically fail that unit of work
in which they cheated; this is
certainly a suitable “punish-
ment.”

Those who are found guilty
of lying under oath or failing
to report infractions should be
punished at the discretion of
the court to an extent not to
include dismissal from college.

Next, the Honor Court must
relinquish the power to inter:
pret the spirit of the law. In-
stead, if it finds it necessary, it
should revise and add to the
laws with the consent of the
faculty and student body.

Most important of all, educa-
tion should receive more stress.
Let everyone be told why hon-
esty is valuable, and why he
should be honest in his own
dealings, and be alert to the
honesty of others.

Let each offense be dealt
with in and of itself, realizing
all circumstances involved.

To replace fear as a deterrent,
let us have education; to replace
severe penalties imposed on the
crime, let us have sane judge-
ments with regard to the of-
fender and the offense as in-
dividual.

Mrs. J. B. Moore, supervisor
of the dormitories, was concern-
ed because all of the hall coun-
selors had to be at school on
Labor Day.

Bob Waugh, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, was
“very dissatisfied” with the ef-
fects of Rush Week and a full
week of classes coinciding. For
the past several years classes
have not begun before Wednes
day of Rush Week.

These were the comments
from some of the higher brass.
However, they were not the only
ones affected. Many professors
found that the earlier start did
not allow them time to return
from summer commitments.

Or. W. O. Puckett had to leave
a week early from a course he
was taking at the National
Health Institute.

Freshmen themselves who
were just beginning to get set-
tled, found the week of classes
and rushing to be quite a prob-
lem.

The question rang out from
all sides: Why did classes be-
gin so-early this year? The an-
swers Were many and varied.

Mrs. Grover Meetze, secre-
tary to Dean Johnston, stated:
“We never had this trouble be-
fore the Academic Scheduling
Committee was started.”

__Dr. J. T. Drake, chairman of
the Academic Scheduling Com-
mittee, said that the school had
to end early to allow for the
summer school program. When
asked who set the dates for the
summer session, he said he did
not know.

“Then the whole academic
year is set up around the sum-
mer program?” Dr. Drake was
asked.

“Yes," he replied. “It’s like
the tail wagging the dog.” The
reason for this? Again Dr.
Drake did not know.

F. W. Hengeveld, registrar,
was approached with the ques-
tion of summer school. He ex-
plained that it must begin in
early June and run through late
August in order to allow for
the four three-week sessions.

Hengeveld also brought up
the point that an extra day has
been added to the exam sched-
ule. This, he related, was done
because of requests from stud.
ents and faculty members.

George Trask, student body
president, said he knew nothing
of such a request, and agreed
with several others that extend.
ing the examination period was
unnecessary and useless.

It was pointed out by Dr.
Frontis Johnston, dean of the
faculty, that it is customary to
begin early in September and
end early in May so that “Our
commencement will not conflict
with those of other schools.”

Hengeveld and Dr. Johnston
have both indicated that relief
from the problem might be in
sight. They have been discussing
the possibility of limiting the
summer program to one session,
which may mean that classes
could begin tater in the fall and
continue through the final
weeks in May if necessary.

The committee, however,
must also consider such protests
as those being registered con-
cerning the oddly scheduled
two day semester break (Wed-
nesday and Thursday).

It should be recalled also
that only after strong protests
did the committee decide not
to begin school on New Year's
Day last year.

K Really

Big Shew

By Bill Godwin

I can see it all now.

A blast-off September spectacular for Davidson
College, a new “first” for Tarheelia.

The props are here and we’re so close to being put
on the map that even a lowly freshman saw the possibi-
lities of such a production last week as he quizzed advisor
Bob Stone about our annual cake race.

“Bob,” he asked, in all seriousness, “will we be able
to ride around the course in fraternity cars?”

A buddy of his popped up and wanted to know wheth-
er the course would run past Hatties’.

These questions from uninformed, yet-to-be-converted
Davidsonians. But think of the possibilities.

To date, only Pete Whittle, the track coach, has. He

grabs up the first dozen-or-so winners for his cross-coun-

try team.

Our 1961 caké race is
what could have happened:

baking history now. Heré’s

The race is scheduled for the Saturday before rush
week. Participants are in top physical shape, having taken
the PE qualification tests earlier in the week. Alumni in-
vitations have been mailed and John Horton is pulling all
the stops on radio, television and newspaper publicity.

The big day arrives and everyone takes his station.
Freshmen have emerged from the gym in their Greek
trotting attire. Busloads of fillies from Queens College

have lined the soccer field,

forming hip-hedges to fun-

nel the boys through the pines.

Faculty members and their wives, smarting from
DAVIDSONIAN criticism of their annual, humdeam re-
ception for frosh on the College Union lawn, have moved
the firing line to Richardson Field and are swatting flies
off some sixty chef's delights prepared by our mothers

away from Mother.

They know that this reception will be unique in that,
watching the boys perform, they will have something to

talk about.

Ambitious fraternities have moved up their first rush
party to coincide with the race. Accordingly, they have
set up rest stations along the way, complete with propa-
ganda booths, for weary runners.

But the real pick of the crop, they know, will be the
winners: three score and more of the choicest stud run-

ners.

The race is on. Despite the excellent training, more
than a few runners are panting as they pass the hedges.
The trot becomes a walk for many as they hit the pave-
ment and these are ear bent by some of the more dis-
cerning fraternities, who know that the walkers already
are using their heads and will be valuable at the house
long after legwork season is over.

Meanwhile,

Charlotte’s prettiest have regrouped

their forces at the finish line. Here the winners will be
bid off and couples will perform the rites of fall:

Someone in the stadium chuckles, doubtless remem-
pering the assembly line 2 Burwell Hall, where annual- -
y matriculater and matriculateress met

_ The front-running freshmen enter the track for a
final loop, stimulated into a last-ditch gallop by thoughts

of a field day later.

A field day . . . this is what it could have been.
