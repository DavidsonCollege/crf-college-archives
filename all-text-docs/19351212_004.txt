3urns point out that

past football season we might quote a

few lines from an article which Fred
Blythe of the Faculty asked that we
print.

“The team developed by our coaches
this year has proved itself more success-
ful even than the 1934 eleven. The line
was stronger and charged harder, while
the backs showed more speed and yersa-
tility in their offense.

“Out of nine games played this
year we lost only three, tying two
and winning four. The tie games
with the University of Virginia and
The Citadel could have and should
have been won by Davidson, had

the Wildcats shown the same alert-

ness that characterized their play

in other games. Elon, S. C., V. M.

I., and Wake Forest were subdued

handily; while we lost to State,

Duke, and Carolina only after

heroic struggles.

“The 1936 schedule presents a formi
dable array of opponents, which will tax
the skill and alertness of the \Wildcats
from the opening kick-off with the Blue
Devils to the final whistle of the Turkey

Day battle with the Demon Deacons,
(We start, you see, with Devils and
close with Demons.)”

BIG FIVE CAGERS

COMING oEASON

Peabody, Quick and Knorr Lead
Candidates for Basketball
Berths

The Davidson Wildcat cagers are hard
at work in preparation for a stiff sched-
ule against state teams. The ‘Cats have
been working out daily under the super-
vision of Coach “Flake” Laird.

The main difficulty that coach Laird
has encountered thus far is the prob-
lem of replacing Jim Morgan at center
and Charlie Harris at ,guard. Of last
year’s lettermen, we find Morris Peabody,
Bill Quick, Ken Knorr looking as if they
are ready for starting berths. Wade Bar-
row, a Sophomore, seems sure to see lots
of action this year as well as Lawrence
Refd, and Bill Kiesewetter.

The University of North Carolina has
a real job on its hands in building up
anything like last year’s team. They have
only four lettermen returning, and only
two of that group were regulars on last
season's team, The toughest assignment
that Coach Walker Skidmore will have
will be to replace Stuart Aitken, Jason
Glace and Buck. Harris. The Blue and
White went through twenty-five games
with only two losses and they amassed
828 points to their opponents 606, Captain
Jim McCachren, of Charlotte, Mel Nel-
son, Paul Kaveny and Latch Webster
will be the veterans that will likely be
called on to form the backbone of the
team that must defend its championship
of the Southern Conference and the Big
Five. :

The prospects of the North Carolina
State College team look about the bright-
est in the state. There are five lettermen
returning who will in all probability be
the regulars this year. Dr. R. R. Sermon
cage athletic an-
nounced that the Pack would play twenty-
three games which would carry them into
Virginia, and South Carolina only. Ten

played at Raleigh.

Prospects in the Blue Devil camp loom
brighter this season than in many years.

twenty-three games are

turning from the ten that composed the

they take on the Draper Y.M.C.A. team.
Coach Unger has been working daily
with his squad since the close of football
seasonand has developed a team that
will stand up nicely to last year’s team.
The that Coach
Unger is the job of replacing two stars
his last State Championship
team, Captain Charles Fort (175) and
Lawrence Quarterman (155). There are
now thirty men who workout daily un-

the unlimited class.

The schedule for this season is as fol-
lows: Draper “Y” here Saturday, De-
cember 14; another Y.M.C.A, team be-
tween the holidays and the exam period
(not yet arranged), then the collegiate
season with Duke at Durham,

palachian State Teachers College here
February 15th; North Carolina State at
Raleigh, 22; University of
North Carolina here February 26; and
Maryville February 29, here.

According to Coach Unger, his grap-
plers..will have a hard time defending
their state title because each team will
be “gunning” for that title, and a great
deal depends on the performance of the
veterans from last year’s team. There are
four of these lettermen on this year’s
team, they are; Captain Leroy Black-
welder, Frank Owen, Jim Hodgin and
Charles Parker. Coach Unger says that
“tone of these men should lose a match
in the state this year.’’ And too, a great

Coach McEver Goes To
Conference at Virginia

According to his present plans,
Gene McEver, assistant coach at
Davidson, plans to attend the an-
nual convention of the Southern
Conference at Richmond, Virginia,
next week.

Professor F. L. Blythe, faculty
chairman of athletics, made these
plans public while discussing pros-
pects for the admittance of David-
son to membership in the Southern
(Conference. For a number of
years Davidson, Richmond Uni-
versity, and other small institutions
have been seeking recognition into
this body, and, now that the con-
ference has raised the limit of the

ber of %, pr for
membership appear very bright.

While in Richmond, McEver in-
tends to see Captain N. G. Prit-
chett, former athletic director at
Davidson, who now holds the same
position at the University of Vir-
ginia.

Kittens Drop Game to Charlotte
Team As Iverson and
Johnson Star

The Davidson freshman basketball
team lost a practice game to Purol Pep-
sters Saturday, December 7. Ned Iver-

son, acting captain and Wildkitten for-

ward, held high-scoring honors with 43
points in the 34-28 clash.

Bean led for Purol with twelve mark-
ers from five field goals and two free
throws, while Johnson, Davidson guard
and forward, tallied eight points, The
freshmen led at half-fime by a 17-16
score after a successful rally, but loos-
ened defense opened opportunities for
Purol assists and goals in the second
period.

The Wildkittens fought with tenacity
when they found themselves trailing
13-6 at the beginning and procured the
lead for a time in the first half. Iverson
and Johnson made three baskets apiece;
Tice, forward, and Lee, center, both
scored. Boyd sank a fowl shot during the
play. :

Early in the last half Johnson made
two good free trys, but Bean immediately
followed with two field goals to give
the Purol quintet a lead they kept during
the remainder of the game. The Wild-
kittens attempted to even the score up
to the very end, but the 29-28 score was

Booters Stage Comeback After
Losing Games To High
Point and Duke

BELL IS WILDCAT STAR

Haak, Wilson, and Scott Show
Defensive Ability

The Davidson soccer team staged a
comeback here Saturday afternoon by
defeating a strong team from Charlotte
after dropping two games to High Point
and Duke.

DAVIDSON vs. HIGH POINT

The Wildcats began this game as if to
revenge the tie-they had previously suf-
fered at the hands of the Panthers, and
kept the ball in High Point territory
most of the first half. Although fighting
hard, the 'Cats were unable to score as
several breaks went against them. Early
in the third period the Davidson backs
repulsed a fast High Point attack, but
their efforts were in vain when the
referee awarded their opponents a penalty
kick because of a foul, Culler, ace center
forward for the Panthers, banged the
sphere straight through the posts for the
only score of the game. The Wildcat line
had a relapse of form in the second half,
but the backs stuck to their guns and
stopped the High Pointers cold, except
for the one penalty kick.

DAVIDSON vs. DUKE

As in the High Point contest thé ’Cats
began the game with a ferocious attack.
However this time they would not be de-
nied, and Bill Bell at center forward
scored after Charlie Bixler had centered
the ball from his right wing position. A
few minutes later Harry Morris, left
inner for the Dukes, got off a long run,
but Goalie Haake caught his kick and
made a good throw out. Failing, Duke
halfback, stopped the ball and passed to
Ambler, -his center forward, who took
it under/his supervision and tied the score
with a beautiful run and perfect kick.
The Davidson line was unable to get
started again, while Morris was making
a goal in each of the last two frames,
bringing the score to 3-1. Haake starred
for the Wildcats with his many seemingly
impossible stops and long kicks.

DAVIDSON vs. CHARLOTTE

Davidson kicked ,off and penetrated
deep into Charlotte territory where the
ball remained for the entire period. The
playing was torrid on both sides and the
"Cats could not score until they were
given a penalty kick because of a Char-
lotte foul. Bixler made the kick and
booted the ball through one side of the
goal just out of the reach of Hutchison,
the Queen City goal-keeper. Bell, Bixler,
and Armstrong promptly engineered an-
other Davidson drive, which culminated
in a score when Hutchison caught Bix-
ler’s kick and was knocked head over
heels through the goal by Bell before
he could get rid of the ball. Early in
the third period Davidson tried a corner
kick which was successful when Vogler
