News and Views of
Wildcat Events

By Raymond Lake

Athletic Editor's Note: In changing from
the head used for this column during the
past yeaf to the above head, the Athletic
Editor has attempted to make a forward
step and to better in a small way the appear-
ance and quality of the Sport Page and of
this column. The new head was modeled
after a similar head appearing in one of the
leading Southern newspapers, and, we hope,
will meet with the approval of the readers of
this column.

Once again the Wildcats are back in har-
ness, training and grinding, preparing to
continue the fight for the honor and glory
of Old Davidson, the honor which has been,
and is ours, and which we hope to recapture
during the present season, and the glory
which has been and ever will be ours in vic-

Mentors of Big Five Are
~ Jubilant Over Prospects

Carolina Has Prospects for
Unusually Strong Team

With the football season close at hand and
heavy training already under way, the eyes
of fans are being turned on those five teams
which have been in the past, and will be for

tory or defeat. As usual, at the first of the
season, there are quite a few on the campus
and elsewhere who are blue over the pros-
pects for the team. But why be despondent ?
We've got the two best coaches in the state,
and two of the best in the South, for that
matter. We've got the best spirit in the state.
We've got seven of last year’s letter men
back and others to take the places of those
who are not back. We've got several good
men from last year’s freshman team who are
able to handle a place on the varsity eleven,
so again we ask,, Why be despondent?

some time to come ,the most outstanding in
this state. Conference and _ intersectional
games have their importance and involve, as |
a matter of course, local pride and spirit, but
for Davidson and the major part of North
Carolina the state championship race offers
the most interest and color.

Contrary to precedent, most of the reports
coming from the various camps are opti-
mistic. According to Mr. Jake Wade, the
Charlotte Observer authority, and also ac-
cording to about 99 per cent of fandom,
Carolina is tobe the big noise this year. In
fact, Carolina is scheduled to make such a
tremendous ‘disturbance that it seems at first
glance as though the biggest fight will be for
second place. However, it’s an uncertain as |
well as a grand old game, and advance dope |

that may be prominent in the running.

The spirit that wins is not the spirit that is
overcome by despondency. The spirit that
wins is the spirit that fights, and fights till
the last whistle has blown, the Wildcat
spirit! The showirig at the first pep meeting
of the year was good. The cheering was
good, and the cheer leader and his assistants

proved themselves able to lead us on to vic-
tory. Let's get started right and back that
team on through to the finish! The team
can’t quit till it’s all over, and if .we quit or
slow down a little bit just because the outlook
is not quite what it might possibly be, we’re
not doing our duty and are not holding up
our end ‘of the load.

The freshmen have been out only a few
days and at this time it would be hard to
make an estimate of their possibilities. A
goodly number of would-be players have
turned out every afternoon, however, and if
numbers mean anything, we have nothing to
fear from those quarters. While there are
no unusually large candidates out, the group
taken as a whole would stand with or above
the average.

It is not so very unusual for.a good man
to decide not to come back to Davidson for
one reason of another, but when John Currie
decided not to come back, Davidson suffered
an unusually heavy loss. .Not knowing the
reasons for Currie’s decision, we have no
right to complain. Let it suffice to say that
we are sorry he is not back and hope that
by some chance he may decide to return be-
fore the track season opens. During the
summer he broke one more old record and set
one more new record for himself, thus add-
ing another to his-listof accomplishments.

“Another rumor on the campus to the effect
that the track team will hold a fall practice,
or workout, a little later in the year, has
come to our attention. The members of the
track team might not greet this with any
great degree of enthusiasm, but it looks like
a good idea. It would give the runners more
chance to develop and at the same time would
not cause them to. grow stale, the intermis-
sion between the fall and spring workouts

There is good reason for Carolina’s high
hopes. She has good coaches, plenty of ma-
terial and a brand new stadium. Just how
far they will get with this combination re-
mains to be seen, but they have nearly all of
last year’s regulars back, with about three
equally good men pushing each for his po-
sition. The stadium will bring more pep,
more spirit. The coaching staff will be more
settled than last year.

Duke reports cheerfully lay claim to the
best. team to represent that institution ?n

Duke, also, will
profit by last year’s experience with a new
set of coaches.

Over at State there are dark rumors to the
effect that the Wolfpack which finishéd the
past season in such a whirlwind fashion, will
be the bunch to watch this year. It is prob-

ably Coach Tebell’s last chance to produce a
winner, and as nobody is foolish enough to
underrate Tebell’s ability, it looks as though
there would be a genuine return to form on
the part of the Pack. Many veterans are

The 1926 football champions of North
Carolina are now preparing for another of

the powerful teams of the state. Though
there were only cight varsity letter men who
turned out for football this fall, the pros-
pects do not look quite as gloomy as some
would make the uninformed believe. At the
first real scrimmage on Saturday, September
9th, the team showed up fine.

Harrison, one of the Wildcat’s swiftest
backs, has improved greatly since spring
practice and the showing he has made so far

has been showing mid-season form.
Speed, however, is not the only strong fea-

Coaches Back From
Enjoyable Vacation

Coaches Monk Younger and Tex Tilson
seek mountain retreat for their vacation.
Both coaches have, for the past year or so,
gone to Camp Carolina, where they have
taken an active part in directing some phase
lof the camp’s program. Camp Carolina is
| Jocated in a beautiful spot of our own state,
some 60 miles from Asheville, and is main-
tained by a group of business men of Jack-
sonville, Fla. This year there were four
college coaches engaged, each directing some
department of athletics. Coach Monk was
|in charge of the baseball department, while
Tex directed the department in horseback
riding. During their two months’ stay they
had an opportunity to rest up a bit as well as
keep in good condition. In addition to their
regular duties they joined the camp in tak-
| ing a 60-mile canoe trip to Asheville, return-
|ing to camp by way of automohile. All in _

vacation and are back, ready for their part,

tilts which we have played heretofore.

The first game of the season is with Cita-
del, on September 24th, at Gastonia. On Oc-
tober Ist, the Wildcats’ first big engagement

Lee, Alabama, Georgia, the University of
Kentucky and several of the other big teams
of the South. Davidson’s showing in the
Florida game should give a good idea of the
Wildcats’ strength as compared to that of
the other teams of the South.

After the Florida game, Davidson plays
Wofford College, at Spartanburg, S. C., on

October 8th. On the 15th of October the’

Wildcats play their first game on the home
field.’ This game is with Elon. All of the
games which are even comparatively easy
will be over after the Elon game.

The Wake Forest game, which was to have
been played on October 22nd in Charlotte, has
been transferred to Greensboro on the same
date. These two sectarian schools, though
on very good terms with each other in ath-
letic contests, always offer each other all the
opposition they may need. For the past two
seasons the scores have been tied. -In 1925
the score was 7-7 and in 1926, 3-3.

The most important and interesting game

of the season for Davidson is always on

later the game that North Carolina people
always look forward to, the Davidson-Caro-

scheduled to be played at Chapel Hill. There
is, however, some rumor that the game will
be on the Wildcats’ home field.

game is scheduled for November 20th.

Preparatory School, at Oak Ridge. This
game is always a hard one, as the Oak Ridge
boys generally have a fast, heavy team. Duke
with its large freshman class, should have as
good a team as the one they had last year.
The remaining three games, those with Wof-
ford, State, and Presbyterian College, should
also prove highly interesting. The following
is the schedule:
