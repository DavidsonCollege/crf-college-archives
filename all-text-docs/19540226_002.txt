Trustees Vote To Underwrite
$35,000 For Athletics Commended

The request for the underwriting of $35,000 for football
and basketball scholarships by the Board of Trustees seems
to be a definite forward step that may eventually lead David-
son’s intercollegiate athletics out of the proverbial woods.

This is still far less than the other Southern Conference
colleges are spending on these two sports, but is about $10,000
more than has been contributed by the Wildcat Club in the
past years. Under the proposed set up the Wildcat Club would
continue its fund-raising activities and whatever sum it col-
lected would be included in the $35,000 figure. If this figure
is not attained, however, the college assumes the responsi-
bility for making up the rest of the amount.

It was specified by the trustees that $30,000 of this
amount would be devoted to football, and $5,000 to basketball.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether this increase
will materially change Davidson’s athletic situation when
rival schools are still spending much more.

A considerable group here feels that the athletic dollar
will go farther at Davidson than a many other schools. David-
son is no less expensive than other schools, but many think
that with our present capable athletic department and better
use of alumni connections throughout the Southeast, David-
son can do much better. At any rate we feel that with some
increase in funds and reasonable guarantee that the funds
will be forthcoming, we can hold our own against reasonable
opposition.

IFC Scores With Name Bands,
But Will Someone Fix P.A. System!

With the announcement this weekend that Ray Anthony
is returning to Davidson for Spring Frolics we hasten to
proffer a word of commendation for the IFC members.

They have done a splendid job in signing three of the top
dance bands in the country for the interfraternity dances this
year. It is doubtful whether they could have done better
under any circumstances in getting well estabilshed names in
dance music.

We hope, however, that this spring the past difficulties
with the sound system in Chambers will be born in mind,
and that those in charge of Anthony's concert and Spring
Frolics will see to it that suitable equipment is available. Just
about everybody will agree that it’s better if you can hear
the vocalists as well as see them.

It does seem a bit wasteful to spend several thousand
dollars on a “big name” band, only to see its effectiveness
marred by failure of the sound system.

College Giving Long Due Attention

To Business, Economics Majors

The creation of a separate Department of Business is
especially noteworthy insofar as it represents an improved
opportunity for men attending Davidson who are preparing
to enter the business world.

Perhaps there was a time in the past when the great
majority of the students at Davidson were preparing for one
of the professions such as the ministry, or medicine. Though
we still have many “pre-s” enrolled here, the growth of the
college has seen a corresponding and proportionate growth in
the number of men majoring in business and related fields.

Without reflecting on anyone in particular, we think it
fair to say that for many years the college tended, or at least
seemed, to deemphasize the importance of business, economics
and related fields as contrasted with the more liberal arts.

It is not without significance that students leaving David-
son, and planning business careers, have many times deemed
it wise to study an additional year or so at other institutions
in order to better equip themselves.

It is not impossible that the business major often has
been made to feel like a stepchild in the eyes of a good part
of the college community, and we are glad to see that he is
now getting more of the attention deserved him by the college.

Carolinian At Oxford

(Ed. note: The following is

a reprint from the January 31

issue of the State Magazine

and was written by another

American student at Oxford.

Hubert Cannon graduated

from Davidson last year and

was awarded a Rhodes scholar-
ship.)

A tall young South Carolinian,
armed with a six-foot Confederate
flag and a detailed map of his
native state, came to Oxford Uni-
versity last fall. In a spacious suite
at Christ Church, one of Oxford's
most famed and. aristocratic col-
leges, this young man is already
proving hig favorite axiom: “You
can take a man out of the South
but you can’t take the South out
of a man.”

Hubert N. Cannon of Lancaster
has won one of the most coveted
awards in the academic world: a
Rhodes scholarship. He is at pres-
ent the only South Carolinian to
hold this honor. .

In 1902 the last of Britain’s great
empire builders died and left an
immense fortune to endow the
scholarships which bear his name.
Since then thousands of carefully-
selected young men have come to
Oxford from all parts of the Eng-
lish-speaking world. Here they
have fulfilled the vision of Cecil
Rhodes and returned to their
homes to foster a clearer under-
standing between the English-
speaking peoples.

It is said by many Americans
who have suddenly found them-
selves transplanted temporarily to
Oxford that only one aspect of
university life here is similar to
that in the United States: sleep.
Students even wake up different-
ly here.

In the early morning a scene
takes place in Hubert’s room that
is worthy of a high-flown British
movie about high-flown people. An
elderly man quietly comes into
the sitting room, draws the cur-
tains and lights the fire. Then,
carrying a pair of shoes that he
has polished, he walks into the
bedroom and announces in solemn
British tones: “It’s half-past seven,
sir.”

This is Jim, the “scout” or col-
lege servant assigned to Hubert.
To Jim, Hubert is one of the dozens
of undergraduates he has fathered
and mothered in his $2 years of
service. Like with many other
scouts his profession is a family
tradition. His own father tended
to Oxford students for half a cen-
tury.

As in America meals are eaten
rather than injected with a
needle, but here the similarity
ends. Manners, setting and the
food itself are different in nearly
all respects. Hubert eats in the
most beautiful dining hall in Ox-
ford. It is an enormous, oak-
panelled room with a timbered
ceiling built in the reign of Henry
Vor. ‘

The table manners of Hubert’s
English companions would seem
atrocious in South Carolina. But
then American manners make an
equally bad impression on the vis-
counts, lords and baronets who
eat their ple with fork and spoon
and squash peas on the back of
their fork.

It js the food itself, however,
which makes Hubert appreciate

By JOANNE KING

the joke that British concoctions
are the best food for those who do
not like to eat. It is so different
in fact, that even English students
dislike it. Kippers, porridge,
steamed pudding and boiled pota-
toes form the staple diet of the
Oxford undergraduates. But Ox-
ford authorities laugh off the age-
old comments and say that any
improvements would deprive stu-
dents of their richest sources of
wit.

But it is not to eat that people
come to Oxford but to study, and
for that Hubert, like every other
American here, considers this
ancient university well-suited.

Lectures themselves are relative-
ly unimportant and few students
attended them regularly. There
are no quizzes or class-participa-
tion and attendance is optional.
Their most remarkable feature lies
in the fact that those students
who go must wear a short, black,
shapeless, cotton gown over their
normal clothes.

It is rather in the tutorial sys-
tem that the real value of Oxford
education lies. Hubert, who grad-
uated last June from Davidson Col-
lege with an A.B. is taking a course
here in politics, philosophy and
economics, a combination gen-
erally referred to as P.P.E. Twice
a week he visits his tutor, a spe-
clalist in these subjects whose
main duty is to prepare him for
final examinations two years
hence.

For these one-hour private tu-
torials Hubert writes and reads
to his tutor an essay on some
aspect of the course he is study-
ing. The tutor then discusses with
him its merits and faults and as-
signs a vast amount of reading ma-
terial in preparation for next
week's work. To Hubert this sys-

tem has three important advan-
tages. In the first place, he can
travel at his own pace and is not

geared to the average level of aj tary

large class. Secondly, he can feel
that the man most responsible for
his education makes a definite and
personal interest in his progress.
And finally, it gives him a feeling
f independence and _responsi-
bility.

Although a high academic stan-
dard is required to win a‘Rhodes
scholarship this in itself is not
enough. Cecil Rhodes distrusted
the mere bookworm and by the
terms of his will only young men
with wide and varied interests
were eligible. Oxford encourages
these interests extremely well.

Sports are at least as popular
here as in any American univer-
sity. Each of the 21 men’s colleges
has its playing field and during
the year one see everything from
soccer and squash to cricket and
jiu jitsu. Every student partici-
pates in sports and Hubert is no
exception. He has gone in for prob-
ably the most popular one here:
rowing. During the past two
months he has spent nearly every
afternoon on the Isis, a branch of
the Thames.

In the evenings so many activ-
ities go on that most students are
afraid to stay in their colleges for
fear they will miss something
worthwhile. Not only does Oxford
boast two legitimate theaters where
many first-rate plays are shown
prior to their London opening, but
there are clubs and societies which
bring some of the most famous
speakers in the world to Oxford.
The Oxford Union, a debating
society of which Hubert is a mem-
ber, is, together with that at Cam-
bridge, the recognized proving

Marburg Writes Appreciation

For Davidson’s

(Ed. note: The 1948 Christ-
mas gift fund money was sent
to the University of Marburg
in Germany. This letter was
received recently by Dr. Cun-
ningham to show the con-
tinuing appreciation of the stu-
dents at. Marburg for the gift.)

Dear Dr. Cunninghant.

At Christmas, 1948, the students
of your college were kind enough
to choose the University of Mar-
burg as the recipient of their an-
nual Christmas collection. Your
extensive and generous gift
reached us in the early summer
of 1949.

And now, on the fifth anniver-
sary of this charitable action, sym-
bolic of the spirit of reconciliation
and helpfulness on the part of your
American students, I am writing
you to express again the thanks
which my predecessors sent you at
that time. As a result of the dif-
ficult conditions of those years
many students were  under-
nourished and poorly housed; they
were therefore most thankful for
the more substantial meals in the
university cafeteria and in the va-
rious dormitories which were made
possible by Davidson College's

1948 Gift Fund

generous gift, which was appor-
tioned by a committee of teachers
and students formed for this pur-
pose. Especially grateful were the
sick students, who received,
through the student physician,
medicament and particularly
nourishing foods from your ship-
ment. Rest assured that the gen-
erosity of your students has not
been forgotten; we shall always re-
member it gratefully as a gesture
of solidarity and as an important
step on the path to a fruitful rela-
ttonship between our two peoples
in the future.

We hope very much to be able
to welcome you someday in Mar-
burg, in order to thank you per-
sonally; we would therefore be
grateful if you would let us know
in case you plan to come to
Europe. The theological faculty
heartily joins in hoping to have
you here as our guest.

With best wishes from the Unt.
versity of Marburg for you and
your college In the coming year,
and in grateful remembrance of
your helpful initiative, I remain,

Sincerely yours,
THE RECTOR.

Y Program Seen As Energetic
And Far From “Complacent”

In Stein Wilson's discussion of
the YMCA last week, there were
some glaring errors, a touch of
fallacious reasoning, and a gist of
truth.

It was truthful to the extent
that it recognized that the David-
son Y has shortcomings and that
there is some student resentment
to the Y program on the campus.
In a moment I will deal with the
article’s fallaciousness and lack of
proper reasoning.

First of all, let me explain my
interest in this matter. As the one
who holds the publications post
on the Y Cabinet, I am concerned
that the Y be given favorable pub-
licity. More than that, I am con-
cerned that the picture that is
given of our YMCA is a truthful
one, and further, that it is one
that is seen in the light of actual
experience and fact—not one based
on lack of adequate knowledge of
the entire situation.

This point of view is also not
the official Y opinion, but is the
view of one of its members who
has a vital interest in the organi-
zation and its well-being. For an
official answer, you may see Sam
Magill or Charlie Williams.

The fact that compulsory Y mem-
bership has its inadequacies is
recognized not only by the Y Cabi-
net as a group, but also is seen
by the Y Board of Directors, a far
more powerful policy-making
group, and the current Y secre-

-

The defense for such an organi-
zational structure lies in other
hands, but I imagine that the
finances of the Y and the whole
Christian background of the school
enters into it. Davidson is com-
mitted to the Christian ideal in
education and has been so for as
long as there has been a school
here.

It is the natural desire of the
college to have some all encom-
passing method of organizing the
students in their Christian expres-
sions. This is the Davidson Y.
This utilizes the paternalistic con-
cept of providing for student needs

By JIM MOORE

Your writer cannot entirely
justify the paternalistic approach,
but certainly one needs to recog:
nize the situation as it is if he is
to understand what is happening.

As a matter of fact, the reaction
against the compulsory Y mem-
bership character of the Y is a
part of a greater reaction against
paternalism itself that is today ex-
pressing itself among students.

Where Wilson falls down hardest
in his approach to the Y situation
here is in his statement, “The Y
Cabinet has become complacent in
respect to its service to the stu-
dent body, and one reason for this
is the fact that it does not have
to perform any real service to the
student to keep up its member-
ship.”

Now, is the very fact itself (Y
Cabinet complacency) true in fact
as he says it is? In the mid-year
report of the Davidson YMCA the
one rather startling conclusion one
gained from hearing facts, figures
and the story of great work and
effort being put fortli, was that
the Davidson Y is anything but
complacent.

Your Y carries on a great variety
of functions, among which are
those more or less strictly in the
Christian realm, as deputations,
Sunday School extension, College
Bible Class, chapel programs, fall
services, gift fund. Then there are
a great many social organizations
aided and frequently directed
through Y personnel, as the Gra-Y,
Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, commu-
nity work and social activities.

The YMCA secretary attempts to
be, first of all, the student's sec-
retary, for he regards his job as
that of one who tries to aid stu-
dents through the Y. He not only
goes so far out of his way as to
organize a summer placement
bureau, he also is alive to current
needs and has helped form a fresh-
man council.

The cabinet has regular meet-
ings at which current develop-
ments of the various posts are dis-
cussed and general business is tak-
en under consideration. Also there

But Politics At Davidson
Is So Ungentlemanly

-The columns of the Davidsonien
and the conversation in the Col-
lege Union are largely concerned
with one subject—complaining
and griping about the state of
things at Davidson. This is not
unnatural. A student group is al-
ways more liberal than the older
generation which is represented
by the faculty, administration and
trustees, or if not more liberal, at
least more eager for change. At
Davidson there is no way to ex-
press this understandtable feeling
except through futile and therefore
usually destructive ‘talk. We have
the feeling that very little which
we as students advocate has any
chance of becoming reality, and so
we are often for anything which
is different from the status quo
whether we have carefully eval-
uated it or not. In order to de-
velop any sense of responsibility,
there must be the possession of
some power. The student body now
has practically none. The state-
ment is often heard that our only
right as Davidson students is to
leave school. There can never be
better feeling between the fac-
tions composing Davidson until
such statements as this lose any
claim to being true even in part.

There is now an organization
which is supposed to represent the
student viewpoint. But the Stu-
dent Council is generally looked
upon by its constituents as the
tool of the Dean. Why is this? In
the spring when we have student
elections, there is no particular
interest or excitement in evidence
around the campus. The various
candidates have five minutes
worth of pleasantries to say in
chapel, and we have another Stu-
dent Council. It has been elected
without the airing of a single issue.
Its members cannot be blamed for
not knowing what the student
body wants it to work for. Thero
has been no chance to measure
public opinion. Only students who

campus as it is in most institutions,
various groups could express them-
selves in the support of a certain
idea. Persons who were interested
in the Student Council could have
a say before they were eliminated
in the preliminaries. The candi-
dates who were successful would
have some idea of what concerned
the students. Last year, it seems
very likely that Lyman Kiser
would have been elected by either
method, but if there had been cam-
paigning Lyman would have had
an easier course in working for
the things which the student body
wants. He has done a good job in
many ways, but he has had a dif.
ficulty in that he has no way to
show that the student body is be-
hind his proposals and he cannot
be sure himself. If the president
had been elected on a platform in
competition with candidates hav-
ing other platforms, he would not
be faced with this problem.

Politics would even seem bene-
ficial in the YMCA elections. Stein
Wilson, in last week's edition,
pointed out many shortcomings of
the Y. These are bound to exist so
long as the Y is controlled by an
almost hereditary president. He
works his way to that position
through the activities of the YMCA
which remain largely rumor to the
student body, and he, too, has no
way to learn what the students
actually want from the Y. The
situation last spring when Hallett
Ward seemed likely to be the next
YMCA president illustrates the
fact that when we are denied the
opportunity to exchange ideas
concerning the future of an organ-
ization with candidates for its of-
fices, we will turn to any candi-
date who seems to offer a drastic
change, whether good or bad.

If these advantages which I have
attempted te show seem valid to
you, why is it that student political
activity is forbidden? Davidson
seems hardly the place where cam-

comings. There are a great num.
ber of ways of looking at the mul.
titude of problems that have con-
fronted us.

There is the question of partici.
pation of more students in the pro-
gram, To begin with, there is a
definite point of no return in the
number of people who can effec-
tively be employed in the Y. That
isn’t to say the Davidson Y has
reached that point.

In some areas, after exhaustive
efforts to reveal places for develop-
ment, few feasible ones have been
found in which to enlarge the
scope of the work.

Take Sunday School extension
for instance. Will Terry has been
writing to churches in this area
since school began, asking them if
they need Sunday School teachers.
The replies are often unencourag-
ing to say the least.

But even if this is true, the Y
is always anxious and ready to get
new blood and ideas into the or-
ganization.

One point that is often over-
looked in this discussion is the
decision as to those on whom the
responsibility lie. Is it that of the
Y, or the individual student's
part to see that he takes advantage
of what the Y has to offer?

All of this talk of the Y not fol-
lowing up on its promise to get
more people to work has some
validity, perhaps, but much of it
seems to me to be way off base.
What man ever won a girl after
making the first flirtatious ad-
vances, and then sitting by waiting
for her to come knocking on his
‘door?

The way seems now well open
to some wooing and winning of the
Y by students rather than the
present standing by and waiting
to be called.

body’s candidate. It would be of
decided advantage to us if when
we think of persons we could
also think of issues. I believe that
we would have a much more sat-
isfactory relationship between the
various groups at Davidson if we
could air our gripes thoroughly at
election time and could then give
our support to student officers who
were working for things we hed
decided to support.

P. S. Let me add a suggestion
and a request to Dr. Davidson in
this week’s column. I think it
would be a great convenience if
some book deposit slot were pro-
vided in one of the library doors
so that reserve books which had
been checked out for the weekend
could be returned on Sunday night.
This would end the mad Monday
rush to get them in by 10 a.m.
