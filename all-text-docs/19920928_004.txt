Baan Student Goes Weaving Through Kenya

By Weave Whitehead _
Can you imagine playing soc-
cer with a cheetah? or restraining

the legs of a giraffe fifteen feet :

tall? Well, bgt! could I until I
went to
t h «se
School
for Field
Studies’
Center
for Wild-
life Man-
agement
in Kenya.
I spent
last se-
mester
studying
wildlife
manage-
ment and
ecology and then returned during
the summer as an intern with. the
school. The two experiences, as a
student and as staff member, were
totally different, yet equally en-
lightening and entertaining.
Before I tell my story, ‘I will
give a little background about the
study site. The Center for Wildlife
Management Studies is located on
a game ranch in the Athi-Kapiti
Plains about forty miles southeast
of Nairobi. The ranch was started
by Dr. David Hopcraft as an ex-
periment in sustainable utilization
of wildlife. The land is predomi-
nately grassland with scattered
Acacia trees. Many species’ of
ungulates (hoofed mammals) and

birds live within the fenced ranch.
There are no large predators,
though. Because the ranchis in the
southern hemisphere, the seasons
are opposite from ours. The aver-
age after-
noontem-
perature
from
_ January to
April was
about 90
degrees
(there is
virtually
no humid-
Pty.
though,
so. this
was not
uncom-
fortable).
Our camp was without electricity
(except for a small generator to
power some lap-top computers) so
we were dependent on the sun to

- dry our clothes and heat our water.

The living arangements were
thatched roofed huts called bandas,
with four students to each one.

In late January, thirty students
gathered in the Boston airport with
a common destination, the Jomo
Kenyatta International Airport in
Nairobi, Kenya. We cautiously
approached one another, introduc-
ing ourselves and discussing our
expectations. We arrived in
Nairobi, about thirty hours later, in
the dark of night and were loaded
into Land Rovers for the journey to

the ranch. Though I was weary
from the travelling, my mind was
in overdrive, trying to absorb ev-
erything. :

Somewhere along the dark
highway leading out of Nairobi,
we were stopped by large metal
spikes in the road and men carry-
ing machine guns. As our driver
slowed down, silence overcame us
just in time to hear her mutter,
“Uh-oh”, As the men approached
the Land
Rover from
a small fire
built beside
the road, my
heart raced.
I found my-
self clench-
_ing my
backpack
and hoping
that these
men would
only » take
our belong-
ings, notkill
us. As three
circled the
car, one man spoke to the driver in
alanguage thatsounded likea string
of consonants. Strangely, we were
allowed to proceed. I later realized
that police check-points such as
this are a common occurrence on
Kenyan highways.

After unloading our bags, we .

were allowed a few hours of sleep
and then the course began. Stu-
dents take four classes during the

semester course. Wildlife Man-
agement and Biology covers ev-
erything from the digestive physi-
ology of ruminants to mammal
census techniques to fence-build-
ing. Wildlife Ecology addressed
broader topics like African clima-
tology and population genetics. In
Ecological Anthropology, we stud-
ied African cultures and their in-
teractions with wildlife and con-
servation. The last class is a di-

rected research project. I chose to
study the diversity and composi-
tion of bird species on the ranch.

- Duringa typical day “oncam-
pus”, we would wake up about
6:30. The mornings were usually
alloted as research time. My re-.
search consisted of going to differ-
ent habitat
types on the ,
ranchandbird *
watching (an
activity I pre-
viously
thought was
reserved for
old people).
Not only did I
learn to iden-
tify birds, but
I was able to
observe many
other animals
as I wandered
through the
savanna. Dur-
ing the after-
noon, when
the sun was at full strength, we
settled down to our open-air class-
room. for lectures. After dinner,
prepared by students, we either
studied or sat around a fire and
discussed issues suchas the moral-
‘ity of
wildlife
interven-
tion.
From
Tuesday
to Sun-
day, we
followed
this basic
routine,
but Mon-

nity to go

home.

Three times during the semes-
ter, we loaded the Land Rovers and

wenton safari. Our first safari was
to the Masai Mara Game Reserve.
This is the Kenyan portion. of the
Serengetti Plains, famous for the
migration of 1.4 million Wilde-
beest and associated Zebra and
Gazelle. Unfortunately, the masses
of Wildebeest were not there, but
the Reserve was not without wild-
life. Lions, cheetahs, Cape Buf-
falo, rhinos, elephants and, of
course, the birds gave us ample
opportunity to look and learn.
After leaving the Masai Mara,
we journeyed to Lake Nakuru
National Park, “Home of A Mil-
lion Flamingos”. Lake Nakuru
isashallow soda-lake. The lake
and surrounding forests are
teeming with birds. The mam-
mals there, on the other hand,
have been subject to massive
die-offs in recent years.

The second safari took us to

i Tsavo and Amboseli National

Parks. Tsavo,the largest park in
Kenya, is dominated by dense
shrubland, making animal ob-
servation challenging. The “‘fea-
ture attraction” in Tsavo is
Mzima Springs, a natural spring
that is home to a colony of hippo-
potamuses, crocodiles, and more
birds. The road from Tsavo to
Amboseli is easily the worst road
on which I have ever traveled.
Though the trip is only about forty
miles, it took almost seven hours.
Because the
road runs
closely to the
Tanzanian bor-
der there is a
possibility of
bandit attacks
so an armed
guard is re-
_ quired in every
car. This, my
second encoun-
ter with a gun-
totin’ Kenyan,
was much less
frightening
than the first.
Upon
arriving in
Amboseli I was
shocked by the condition of the
land. The park is quickly becom-
ing a desert. A large population of
Africa’s most destructive animal,
the elephant, is widely regarded as
the cause. Sadly, Kenya is at an
impasse
