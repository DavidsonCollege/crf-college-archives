Davidson College and the
surrounding community can
expect a modern face-lift in the
near future because of signifi-
cant advances made towards
development programs discus-
sed in the October 4th meeting
of the Board of Trustees.

The Board gave its go-
ahead for hiring the architects
to plan the new Dining Com-
mons, reports Buildings and
Grounds Committee Liaison
Grover C. Meetze Jr. Al-
though no plans are final, the
food facility may be built
across from the main entrance
to Richardson Dorm.

Along with a new eating
house, there are plans for
other additions to the campus
as well: additional student
housing is being considered,
possibly behind Patterson
Court; a proposed new art
building may be constructed
across Main Street; a new field
house possibly placed in the
area below the soccer fields;
and a new wing added to
Martin Science Building.

Some plans to renovate the
Davidson business district,
possibly into a walking mall,
are included.

“We're trying to plan as far
ahead as we can see,’’ says

The, Advisory Council on’

Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) will review on Mon-
day an unwritten faculty poli-
cy that no major social event
will be held on weeknights.
The policy came up during
the recent SAE-Union contro-
versy over the scheduling of
the Janice dance Thursday

Director of the Student
Union C.Shaw Smith original-
ly vetoed the dunce because of
the policy, but after a recom-
mendation from the CCRL to
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. urging him to
make an exception in the case,
Spencer overruled Smith.

Smith has the authority to
veto such events because, as
Director of the Ynion, he “is
responsible for the scheduling

Meetze. Because of his study
of Davidson population
changes, Meetze is ‘‘planning
to accomodate 1600 students
by 1987,” although he admits
there might not be that many.

To finance the ‘‘1987 pro-
gram,” Meetze expects to use
part of the $35 million fund
that the school hopes to have
raised by then.

In a Finance and Manage-
ment committee progress re-
port, Liaison Robert A. Currie
says that,‘‘ the town and
college are encouraging (the
construction) of an apartment
project for 50 families,”’ which
would be government subsi-
dized. If the federal funds
arrive soon, the construction
of the lower-income family
housing could begin in Decem-
ber. A possible site is the area
between the I-77 access road
and the General Time Plant.

Currie also reports the pos-
sibility of a retirement com-
munity for faculty, alumni,
and locals. College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and
some local citizens will review
the feasibility of the project,
which would be privately sup-
ported.

Liaison for Student Life and
Health committee Will Terry
reports that the group review-
ed the plans for the college

of campus-wide events, re-
gardless of location,’’ accor-
ding to a letter from Spencer
to SAE. President Jud Bryan.

Spencer explained Smith’s
position in the same letter,
writing: ‘‘Because of the num-
ber and variety of such events
during the College year, it is
absolutely essential that one
agency have the responsibility
and authority for scheduling.
That is the Union’s function.”

‘Chairman of the CCRL will
Terry explained, ‘The contro-
very of scheduling Janice
points up the need for a
written policy regarding the
scheduling of major social
events on weeknights. The

~ CCRL will attempt to recom-
“mend such a policy to the

President.”’

Terry excused student ig-
norance of the policy by
saying: ‘‘There are a lot of
good policies which evolve at
Davidson (which) those of us
who work here year after year
assume everybody knows and

“Scheduling social events

son weekdays is one such exam-
ple. You could call it oral trad-
ition.”

Spencer requested the

commons, which is estimated
to cost approximately $1 mil-
lion. The committee ‘‘urged
the dispatch in raising more
money and completing the
project,’”’ says Terry.

In other important Board
actions, the Nominating com-
mittee asked Chairman of the’
Board Warner Hall to stay on
as chairman for one more year.
Chairman of Finance Walter
Lingle was also asked to
remain on the Board. Both
men were to have resigned
their positions October 4, be-
cause both are 70 years old,
the mandatory retirement age
for Trustees. They were given
an appropriate amount of time
to come to a decision, says
Nominating, Honorary, and
Resolutions Committee Liai-
son Gary Barnes.

Davidson Senior Services, a
new non-profit agency located
in the ‘‘Depot”’ is recruiting
student volunteers to perform
services for the elderly of
Davidson.

Students who are willing to

donate some time, talent,

gasoline and energy many
contact Brigid O’Connor, Dir-
ector, at 892-5111.

Services request aid

The DSS matches older
people who need help with
volunteers willing to lend a
hand. A fee is charged for
these services and returned to
the agency.

These funds are used to
enhance the quality of life for
all older people of the com-
munity. The operation of the
Senior Center and its many

services is the primary pur-
pose of the DSS.

The need for chore service
and transportation is pressing
for older people who wish to
remain in their own homes as
long as possible. This is
especially true in our small,
rural community with no pub-
lic transportation. Are you
willing to help?

efry
policy, stating in a memo to
the Council: ‘It is my impres-
sion that the policy has been
increasingly encroached upon
in recent years.

‘“‘The question now is
whether the policy is obsolete
or obsolescent. Is it the judge-
ment of the Advisory Council
that. it should be retained, or
that it should be abandoned?”’

Smith explained the pur-
pose behind the policy as ‘‘a
long standing policy to respect
the academic interests of the
campus--what the College offi-
cially condones.

**My concern beyond the
academic thing is that if we
were to be invaded with a
tremendous amount of social
events during the week (I do
not expect that to hiappen) we
would have a hard time
finding a place to schedule
vuwurabPevents. They do not

fit on weekends it
Social events on weekends
are meant ‘‘to enhance (stu-

- dent’s) lives here so they do

not have to leave,’’ according
tohim. |

Smith said if the faculty is
not concerned with the placing
of major social events on
weekdays ‘I certainly have no
reason at all (not to hold social
events). My impression, with-
out taking a vote, is that the
faculty is in favor of this
policy.”

Professor of Psychology
John_ Kelton, Vice-chairman
pro-tem of the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee, believes the
Faculty will support the policy
as it stands because holding
major social events on week-
days (especially Thursdays)
could pressure faculty mem-
bers into not scheduling re-
views or papers on Fridays.

According to SAE Social
Chairman Bill Barnett; the
SAE’s did not know of the
policy.

“The thing we could not
understand and still do not
understand is why there is a
distinction between what Pat-
terson Court can do on week

nights ir ++-'- -ynuheuses ”

versus campus wide when the
parties they have down there
are campus wide. They just
do not use campus facilities.

‘*Why have no objections
been raised about those par-
ties?’’

Terry explained that parties
held in fraternity houses can
not be considered campus-
wide because of space limita-
tions.

Smith said, ‘“‘The difference
is in what we encourage and
what we allow.

“There is a subtle but,
important difference, and I
think the students need to
make that decision.”

Barnett
Barnett also raised the
of discos on Thurs-
day nights. In explanation
Smith defined a ‘‘major’’ so-
cial event, as one which in-
voives a lot of time and costs a
lot of money
