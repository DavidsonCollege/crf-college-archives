ALUMNUS RETURNS
FROM KOREA

Mr. J. R. Parker, who ‘was graduated
from Davidson in ‘08, and wok his
M.A. the following year, has returned
from Kunsan, Korea. Mr. Parker is
also a graduate of the: Union ‘Vheologi-
cal Seminary, of Richmond, Va. He
went out to Korea in May, 1y12, where
he began studying the language with a
view to doing evangelistic and Sunday
school work. He was forced to come
home on account of his wife's health.
‘Yhe malaria fever, which is very prev-
alent in parts of Korea, attacked Mrs.
Parker shortly after going out to Korea.
After fighting the disease for two years
without success, she and Mr. Parker re-
turned to America a short time ago.

Every one in) Davidson will be de-
lighted to know that Mr. Parker, and
his family. will make their home in the
beautiful) mountain country of Seuth-
west Virginia. He has accepted the po-
sition of stated supply for Giles Coun-
ty, his headquarters being at Parisburg,
Virginia.

Mr. Parker had just learned the Ko-
rean language and was beginning to
preach some. It is very unfortunate
that he’should have to give up his work
so soon, and he can be assured that the
love and sympathy of the people of Dav-
idson is extended to him in his trouble.

Mr. J. K. Parker is a brother of
Mr. W. P. Parker, who is supported
in Korea by the Davidson students.

DR. CAPEN VISITS DAVIDSON.
On Thursday, February 4, Dr. 5. P.

Capen, a specialist in higher education

for the LU. S. Bureau of Education, vis-|A-

ited Davidson. Dr. Capen was secured
by the State of North Carolina to make
a tour of its colleges, in which he is to
determine a fair rating of the work be-
ing done by them. In this way the N.
C. Board of Education can better pass
upon the diplomas of graduates who ap-
ply for positions as teachers, when they
know the relative status of the various
North Carolina colleges.

Dr. Capen seemed well pleased with
Davidson and spoke highly of the library
and the records of the college.

Dr. Lynn R. Walker has accepted a
call to the First church, of Morristown,
Tenn.

WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

Ex-President ‘Vatt has been deliver:
ing a number of very interesting lectures
at Cabell Hall before an audience of
1,500, composed mostly of students. His
subject’ owas, “Phe Presidency: — [ts
Duties, Its Powers, Its Responsibilities
and Its Limitations.”

. ° 4

Dr. Smith has announced that a com
pulsory physical training course will be
started in i9gts. A’ compulsory .two
year lecture course on hygiene onee a
week will be given. A course of com
pulsory physical exercise will occupy two
hours each week for the first vear. No
man unabie to swim will) receive his
diploma at the end of his college career,
unless he shows that he is physically
unfit.

. ’

Vedder Sitton, one of Clemson's old
foot ball and -base ball stars, will coach
the base ball team this Spring. Sitton
has plaved with Atlanta, Nashville,
Jacksonville, Cleveland and “Prov as a
pitcher, and knows all the ins and outs
of the game. “The ‘Vigers are expected
to put out one the best teams in-years.

. * ’

The students of the University of S.
C. have appointed a committee to peti-
tion the State Legislature for money to
build a fence around their athletic field,
as otherwise the base ball team wall not
make expenses this spring.

e * a

Washington and Lee and Randolph-
Macon Woman's College have decided
to build a summer cottage at Black
Mountain, N. C, where the Y. M. C.

and . C. A. conferences are
held cach summer. The cost is esti-
mated at $1,000. ‘

The Florida basket hall team was de-
feated by the ‘Jacksonville Y. M. C. A.
to the tune of 35 to 24. The first half
was Florida's, but the Jacksonville boys
braced in the last half and plaved rings
around Florida.

His Davidson friends sympathize
with Mr. Augustus Leazar, class of
1911, in the death of his sister, Miss
Carrie Leazar.
