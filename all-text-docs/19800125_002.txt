The SGA Budget. Committee .

ing Davidson’s budget to the |
budgets of several similar
- According to Committee
- Chairman Richard Terry, “The

budget survey results show no .
Teal conclusions about..David-
son’s budget in Sooipariens, to.
the colleges surveyed:
. Terry said that Davidson
“appears to be about average
among the colleges surveyed in
} budgetary matters, particularly
* in faculty salaries and compen-

* gation.

The budget committee pre-
_ pared. the report because Terry
~: felt there was a need for the
- college community to have the
means for an appraisal of

figures were about average,
Terry noted.

Whereas the average compen-
sation at Princeton was 25%
“above that at Davidson in
1965, it was only 19% ahead in
1979. Qn the other hand, David-
son lost ground to Williams,
which was 5% ahead in 1969
and 10%. ahead in 1979.

- The third area of study,
Alumni and General Giving,

ee ~.puts Davidson in a lower rank

compared to other schools.
“Davidson ranks tenth of 15 with
a per student endowment of
$15,798, while Amherst report-
ed the highest per student
endowment of $49,241.

- The September, 1979 edition
of the American Association of
University: Professors bulletin
‘was the chief source of the
‘committee’s survey results.

The proposed student carrier
current radio station is sched-

. uled to begin operation during

Spring term, according to
Senior Janet Coleman.

Students will be able to
receive station broadcasts via
any radios plugged into outlets
in College dormitories. Carrier
current radio is on the AM dial,
and its quality is similar to that
of AM broadcasts.

Coleman, who leads students
organizing the new station, said
Davidson needs carrier current
radio because ‘‘WDAV is not a
real student activity.” The car-
rier current station will be run
entirely by students.
