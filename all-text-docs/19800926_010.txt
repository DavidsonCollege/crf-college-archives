10—The Davidsonian—September 26, 1980

Brick brothers and Doughboys compile famous IMAC Top Ten

By THE BRICK BROTHERS.
And THE DOUGHBOYS
We know that our name

sounds like a band at SAE but

we are your flickerball sooth-

sayers back for another season

of anecdotes. This week we give

our preseason picks for the

championship.
THE TOP TEN

1) John Porter

2) Hurtin 4 Certin

3) SAE

4) KA

5) At Your Cervix

6) Dirty Old Men

7) Rastros

8) Ed's Breathers

9) PIKA #1

10) The Bottom Liners

1) John Porter—First coor-
dinated black to play flickerball
since Louis Armstrong—and
that includes Vince Parker. J.P.
is the recipient of the ‘‘Bear”
Keith flickerball fellowship
which will raise his D.C. income
to $14,000 this year. He has
spent 3 years grappling with
wife Shelia to prepare for the
rigors of IMAC flickerball.

2) Hurtin 4 Certin—Should
be strong this year with the
addition of Porter, despite the
loss of peripatetic Ed. Offense
will be bolstered by the return
of Yates Sealander who spent

last year toiling in the Beaufort
Marine Flickerball League.
“Frying Pan Hands”’ Ray re-
turns along with the $2000 man.
H4C has the speed, experience
and guts to go all the way.

3) SAE—Twice defending
champions could return to the
winner's circle again if ‘‘coach
on the field’’ Merten stays out
of the realm of playcalling. The
button-down clad warriors have
a lot of talent and could prove a
nemesis to Ports and H4C.
Veterans Wheelock, Merten
lead a talented offense capable
of scoring at will while Chris
‘I'm preppie’’ Daniels heads a
young defense.

4) KA—They have Hill—so
much for talent. Not much left
from last year’s runnerup team
that choked in the finals. Mou-
stache Hall leads a corps of
mediocre KA’s who fill out the
roster. The celebrated KA play-
book will be smaller this year in
accordance with Hill’s GPA.
John ‘“‘Unusual” Marshall adds
a lot of talent making the KA’s
contenders.

5) At Your Cervix—Lots &
Lots & Lots of talent with little
experience. John Carroll, proud
owner of a $1000 dollars worth
of new cookware, should be a
dynamic tailback. John Corso,

the hairiest man in IMAC,
should be able to initimidate
pre-pubescent freshmen.

6) Dirty Old Men—Only
thing that keeps this team
going is tenure. Sterling Martin
(class of '37), Jeff Frank (’21),
John Kelton (’33) and John
Stroud (’70) are the mainstays
of the menopause kids. These
generic warriors of the gridiron
are also bolstered by David
‘“Footnote’’ Shi who is hoping
to supplement his flickerball
incomes with royalties from his
new book which is on sale at the
APO bookstore.

7) Rastros— Meet the David-
son version of the Jetsons. Ken
‘Elroy’”’ Murrah, Buck ‘‘Judy”
Bradberry (J.C. ‘‘Jane’”’ Faulk-
ner, and Phil ‘‘Rastro’”’ Gordon
are the stalwarts of this squad.
Their primary competition
should come from the Cogswell
Cogs.

8) Ed’s Breathers— Should
lose on the road. If they get
behind, there’s a good chance
that they’ll quit. They’ll pro-
bably even forfeit their games.
In fact, they’ll never keep a job
and if they get married it won’t
be long before they walk out on
their wives. These guys are just

disgusting. (Sound familiar, fel-

las?) Look for Barry Prine to

lead the team in speed.
9) PiKA 1—The Pikes are the
surprise team of the season.

* Most of last season’s starters

are back along with some new
talent. The only drawback is
that everybody’s all-IMAC
player, David Barkley, will play
on the second team. And say
guys, be considerate and don’t
take your stereo out to the field
when you play. Leave it at the
house; the art students in
Lingle Manor love it!

10) The Bottom Liners— This
team of freshwomen floosies
doesn’t have any business being
ranked but we like ’em. Led by
Jane “one pair of shorts’ Alex-

anian and Beth ‘My brother’s a
SPE” Mack, they are a shoo-in
for the girls title. (Note: This is
the last girls’ entry of the year.)

There weren’t any IMAC
games played by press time so
we thought we’d report on the
national scene. Iraq threw sev-
eral bombs early and jumped
out to a 21-3 lead over Iran.
That’s all the news for now.

_Add experience
to your degree.

Facts indicate that you may
work in three to five different careers.
It won’t be unusual to make changes
as you go. And it’s entirely possible
that your final career does not even

exist today.

_ Oftenina first job, you are
an assistant to the assistant. Your
responsibility is limited to a desk and

typewriter.

Army ROTC. Learn what it takes to lead.

But when your first job is an
Army 2LT, you'll sone res
have real
management
experience. You'll
be in charge. On

a specific job
assignment, you
could have 30 to
40 people working
for you. And you
could be
responsible for
millions of dollars
in equipment.

Responsibility for people
and resources is exactly the kind of
“take charge” ex
employers seek. It’s a margin of
difference in the increasingly
competitive job market.

Prepare to rise to the top in
your field. Make your first job 3 or 4
years as an Army Officer.
