For Sale

Friends of C. F. Wildman will learn with
pleasure-that-he has just finished writing a
book, entitled: “The Latest Method of Suc-
cessfully Growing a Mustache.” The book
will be off the press within a few days and
will be on sale by the author. - He guarantees
his method to work. The Parcher takes
pleasure in recommending it to all interested
parties.—(adv.)
Note—We would suggest that Paul Price
supply himself with one or two copies of the
above book, and try, that method for a while.

One of our fair visitors of last week,
while out having a game of golf, was heard
to remark, “Oh, I don’t know a thing about
this game. I don’t even know which end of
the caddy to use.” And then the caddy.
passed out.

We knew some one would pull this old one
sooner or later. Fresh Miller, on hearing
that Clater belonged to the Volunteer Band,
said he didn’t know that Clater played any
kind of instrument,

How doth old Tobe, our presser,

His clever schemes employ

In sooth, 'twould be quite true to say
He is the Breeches Buoy.

Tuesday Morning
Song from Skippa Classes.
The year’s at the Spring;

The day’s at the morn;
The morning’s at eight—
And I’m dead to the world!

Gentlemen, for the next lesson, begin
where we left off today and get down to
where we will begin the following time.

“T’m crazy over animals!”

He heard the flapper squeal

So they quickly to Shearer Hall did go
To see the college seal.

“This is grate life,” said the cdal as it fell
into the fireplace.

How often have I twined my arm about
thee, ‘

-How often have I gone to thee in vain,

How often have I stood before thee waiting

And hoping thou wouldst ease my cold and
pain?

—_

Alas! <A frigid touch, a cheerless welcome,

That brings no loving warmth into my
heart;

O wretch!—O silent thing devoid of mercy

My radiator—how cruel thou art!

We don’t
Especially care for
This kind

Of lines

But they’re
Wonderful

Prof.—Mr. Fizzle, your paper is filled
with quotation marks. Whom were you
quoting ?

Fizzle—Well, just between I and you Doc,

Song of the Sucker
The lilies now have wilted

Beside the sunny sea.

The iguana’s plaintive note

Floats down from out the tree.
Great Ezra! What a lemon

My roommate wished on me. y

I smelt the smell of lilies

From the sun-kissed Orient Sea,
And Omar’s music soothed my ears
Beneath the lemon tree.

But acrid was the lemon

My. roommate wished on me.

The Parcher acknowledges with thanks,
the following’ contributors this week: C.

JOHNSTON AND WHITE
FILL SHEARER PULPIT

The Shearer Church pulpit was filled last
Sunday by Frank Johnston and Walter
White. An unusually large crowd, which
consisted largely of young people, was pres-
ent,

Frank Johtiston spoke on the — subject
“Witnessing for Christ.” He applied the
example of the influence of Naomi’s life
over Ruth's to present day life and showed
that the reason our lives are not better wit-
nesses for Christ is that others do not see
enough difference between our lives and
theirs to make them really long to become
Christians.

White’s subject was “Carrying Christ
With You in Your Play, Work and Social
Life.” The relation that Christ has and
should have in the home was discussed. The
type of home from which a person comes
may be judged by his attitude towards it.
Lack of a desire to be at home indicates an
unhappy home life.

The singing at this sé¢rvice should also be
mentioned. The hearty way in which the
large audience sung helped to show their
interest in the service. Harvey Biddle led
the singing.

A MERRY DRAMA

In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

By Ibsen Shaw Milne.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides himself on the
nobbiness of *his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial ;
in regard to his love affairs the old adage,
“Still water runs deep,” is applicable.

Mack—And I say how's this for a poem?

(Bill makes no reply and Mack wonders
greatly but proceeds.)

Mack—

A gentle sow who took recourse
To legal craft and lore

Declared, “I want a quick divorce;
My mate’s an awful boar!”

Bill—(Gradually regaining consciousness )

The stag, however, dropped a tear
And murmured soft and low,

“My charming wife’s a little deer!
I want to keep my doe.”

Mack—Why so?

Bill—Don’t ask useless questions.

Mack—I won't, and don’t but, where is my
coat ?

Bill—In my closet.

Mack—It doesn’t belong there.

Bill—No. :

Mack—How about getting yourself one
some day?

Bill—I sure do need one, reckon that I will
have to get one before I leave for home.
Sure thing one will come in handy riding

Mack—Exactly, that’s .why I will want
mine, and would suggest that you purchase
yourself one.

Bill—And where would you suggest that
I get it?

Mack—I would suggest Mellon’s—they
have a big stock from the best makers, and
boy I do say their coats carry style. And
too, quality considered, their prices are very
low.

Bill—I’ll have to drop in on ’em as I pass
through on my way’ home.—(adv.)
