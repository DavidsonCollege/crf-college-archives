1st Half Floor Miscues
End Tourney Hopes

BY STEVE CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

Davidson’s bid to advance in the Southern Confer-
ence tournament, being held in Richmond, Va., this
weekend, failed yesterday afternoon whén defending
champion George Washington handed the Wildcats their

Following last year’s spring drills, Dole was prompt-
ed to say that they were the best a Davidson football team
had ever had during Dole’s tenure here. Evidently he
was right. The ’Cats compiled a respectable 4-4 record
this past fall (the best since 1958) against some pretty
stiff competition.

With the University of Virginia being added to next
season’s schedule (Oct. 27, at Charlottesville, Va.), Dole
and his men need an exceptionally good head-knocking
campaign this spring in order to get a good head start.

Thirteen seniors will not be on hand to bump heads
this spring, but a fairly good crop of freshmen (rising
sophomores) will get a crack at the open positions, and
twenty-one experienced lettermen will greet Dole on
Wednesday.

One setback for Dole this year came when he learned
that quarterback Benny Coxton, who can do almost any-
thing with a football, wil! not be' able to play this year.
Coxton sustained a shoulder injury in the Furman game
last fall.

The only major personnel change comes as a re-
sult of the news about Coxton. Dole will give Alex Gibbs, |
a fleet halfback who was the ’Cats leading ground gainer |
(260 yards) last season, a try at the quarterback slot. The |
rising senior has already had experience throwing the
ball. As a halfback here, he has often thrown on a run-
pass option play, and as a tailback for Thomasville, N. C
High School, he often threw on the same type of option.

DOLE NABS LOTS OF LINEMEN AND
A HECKUVA WELL-ROUNDED RECRUIT

GLANCING ata list of Dole’s top recruits for next
year, we noticed that he is really going after linemen.
Of the top eleven high school football players who have
indicated that they are coming to Davidson next year,
ten played line.

Probably the best of Dole’s plucks from the high
school ranks is Pack Hindsley from Beckley, W. Va.
Hindsley, who stands 6-3 and weighs 190, played fullback,
end, and tackle at one time or another during his high
school career. Dole plans to play him at end.

In addition, Hindsley is one of West Virginia’s top
prep basketball players, and to top it off, he is Valedic-
torian of his class. It seems that this young stud has
made nothing but straight A’s since the first grade! He
narrowed his many scholarship offers down to two
schools—Davidson and Dartmouth. Believe it or not, he
chose us.

PARKER LIKES 7-3 RECORDS |

HATS OFF to the wrestling team and'Coach Charlie |
Parker for an excellent season. Parker & Co. finished the |
regular season with a 7-3 record, which is the best mark |
that a Davidson mat team has had since 1935. That vear
the Wildcat wrestlers were 7-3 also, thanks mainly to a
scrappy sophomore named Charlie Parker.

THE CRYSTAL BALL (NOT AGAIN)

WE PULLED our crystal ball (dusty but still intact)
off the shelf this week to see if we could find out any-
thing about the conference basketball tournament. We
saw red hot VPI beat West Virginia in tomorrow night’s
finals. The Gobblers, who lost three out of their first
four games, won 16 out of their last 18 contests. Paced
by first team All-Conference members Bucky Keller and
Howard Pardue, they went into the tournament with an
eight-game winning streak, including wins over West
Virginia, Furman, and Wake Forest.

Adamitis,

i night with a 102-8

ticket home—an 85-81 defeat.

Taking advantage of the ner-
vous Davidson players’ many
ball handling miscues in the
first half, GW raced off to a
quick 10-1 lead, which they
never relinquished.

DYNAMITE

Behind the hot hands of little
John Feldman, a 5-10 package
of dynamite, the Colonials took
a 51-36 advaritage to the dress
ing room at halftime. Feldman,
a second team All-Conference
senior, pumped in 8 of 11 shots
from the floor (several from
30 or more feet away) in the
first half, during which he tal
lied 20 of his 27 total points.

Coach Lefty Driesell’s Wild
cats had their work cut out for
them after intermission. Be-
hind the board cleaning tactics
of big Bill Jarman and Terry
Holland, the ‘Cats closed the
gap to 7 points early in the sec-
ond half, but GW began a fast
breaking spree, led by 68 Joe
and ran their lead
back up to 19 points about mid
way through the half.

Davidson spent the rest of
the game in a frantic race with
the clock. A Colonial freeze
didn’t help matters, and the
‘Cats came out on the short end.

JARMAN AGAIN

was again Jarman, second team

season

Trailing by 43-38 at halftime, |
the Wildkittens stormed back |
in the second half for 64 points,
while limiting the Bullpups to |
only 37. This sudden burst was |
due mainly to Dave Thomas,
whose defensive hustle inspired
the rest of the team to come
through with their 12th straight
win.

in addition, Thomas scored

17 points, and three others hit
in double figures—Fred Het-
zel (32), Don Davidson (21), |
and Phil Squier (16).

The Davidson matmen com-

since 1935, including a perfect
5-0 slate against other schools
in this state. During the season
the Wildcats defeated wrestling
teams from the following North
Carolina schools: Pfeiffer

undoubtedly puts him in line
for the All-Tournament team.

Sophomore Bill Beerman
turned in one of his best per-
formances with 21 points (15 in
the first half). Holland and Hay-
wood Evans also hit in double
figures with 14 and 13, respec-
tively. Danny Carrell hit 4 and
injured captain D. G. Martin
scored 3 while seeing limited

In other first round action,
VMI ousted Furman, 76-61; VPI
clobbered The Citadel, 101-83;

SEMIFINALS

Tonight's semifinals find

George Washington clashing
with West Virginia, and VMI
battling with VPI. Tonight's

winners play in the finals to-
morrow night, and the winner
of that game advances to the
NCAA playoffs.

Only Martun and reserve Al-
lan Millar will be lost to the
‘Cats via graduation next sea-
son. With the addition of the
tremendous frosh players to the
squad, Driesell can expect to
improve this year’s respectable
overall record of 14-11, and his
team will be geared for a crack
at the conference championship
in only his third year as head
mentor.

ittens Finish 15-3

Charlie Marcon, Barry Teague,
and Tommy White rounded out
the scoring with 9, 5, and 2

more than a hundred points in
