The Davidson cross coun-
try team was defeated last
Tuesday by an: overwhelm-
ing show of strength on the
part of Western Carolina
University.

Western Carolina demon-

strated. their proficiency in’

the five mile race by taking
the first-10 places which Icft
them with a perfect score.

Coach Sterling Martin
said that Western | Caroina
was much stronger than he
anticipated. Three freshmen
from Western Carolina finish-
ed first through third. Second
place Terry Helms and third
place Tom Gibbons are from
Charlott.e

The first two runners Ben
Bailey and Helms broke the
record for the cross course
at the meet. Bailey's win-
ning time was 26:23.

Martin concluded that
Western Carolina will be a
top contender at the North
Carolina state meet this
year. They have been build-
ing a strong cross country.
program for the past few

years and their present
team ‘is the result.
One advantage Western

Carolina had over the Da-
vidson team was that the
course» run Tuesday was
over pavement and asphalt
which the Davidson runners

are not use to. The Davidson

cross country team runs on a
grass course.

Martin said he was pleas-
ed with: Howard Boyd who
was the top runner of Da-
vidson. Martin also — said
that Joe Shibley is. improv-
ing. Ran Coble had trouble
with a stitch in his leg but
‘he recovered during — the
race.

Today at 4 p.m. the cross

country team will be run-
ning against Furman Uni-

td

versity and Berry College at
Furman. Martin said that
there is a hopeful chance
of beating Berry.

He mentioned that it
would be a __—. significant
achievement’ to run strong
and come out close with
Furman. He said that Fur-

man has two dutstanding
players.
Martin thinks Boyd and

Shibley -will develop into
front runners for Davidson.
He says he is optimistic and
has the basis of a_ strong
team in three freshmen. ant?

Poor Execution _
Disappoints Fa ape

A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

“Poor execution,’ said
Dave Fagg. ‘‘We had poor
execution on both offense
and defense." The result
was a disappointing 20-9 loss
to Trinity College last Sat-
urday in the home opener

After opening the season
with a 14-5 win over Rich-
mond, the gridders greatly
disappointed the first year
head coach. ‘We played well
enough on defense. to win a
lot of games,” said Fagg,
“but. not the one against
Trinity. We had a problem
in executing our defensive
stunts and we = had poor

tackling. We were not sharp’

in reaction or attitude.”

“There were several out-
standing performers on de-
fense in the Trinity game.
John Barbee blocked two
punts, Ritk Hawarah saved
a touchtown with an inter-
ception, and Mike Sikes ran
back an interception for a
touchdown."’

The offensive unit failed to

score against Trinity. ‘‘We
managed to stop ourselves
every time we got the foot-
ball," Fagg said. ‘‘We help
ed Trinity's defense every
time we had the ball. _
_ ‘‘Mark. Thompson is com-
real strong. He's
gaining confidence, and is
on his way to having the
kind of season we predicted
he would have. I don't think
he got the support he need-
ed Saturday. The pass pro-
tection broke down. Rick
Lyon and Mike Mikolayfinas
did look good catching the
ball, But our’ offensive line
play was below its capabili-
ty.”

agg cited two breaks

decide the division title.
