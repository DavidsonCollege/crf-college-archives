A LOYAL ALUMNUS.

One-of Davidson's old students, Wi.7
FF) Milburn, of Chattanooga, ‘Venn., of
the class of ‘10, has chosen to show his
loyalty to the college in a way which is
very much appreciated by “Tire Davip-
SONIAN. When approached on the sub-
ject of how to best help the paper, he
very gencroushy offered to donate an Ad-
dressograph, and this has just been in
stalled in’ Tre Davinsonian office.
This will practically insure every sub-
scriber getting the paper every week, and
they can be addressed much more quickly
than formerly, ‘Vhis machine has ne
limit as to the number which it will}
handle and it is expected that within a
short time the college will also use it for
addressing the Bulletins.

Mr. Milburn is now travelling for the
Addressograph Company, and although
one of the youngest of their many sales:
men, he was among the first five in the
number of machines sold this last vear.
While at Davidson. Mr. Milburn was
business manager of the Annual in’ his
Senior year and in various other lines he
secured much of the training which he is
using today:
