DAVIDS ONIAN SPORTS

Men's Hoops Comes Up
Short Against Ga. Southern

By Chris Hood

As has been the case on the
road throughout the season,
Davidson’s men’s basketball team
battled its opponent before a sec-
ond-half dry spell halted forward
progress. On Saturday, it was Geor-
gia Southern which finished
strongly, besting the ‘Cats, 83-71,
in Statesboro. With the defeat,
Davidson slipped to 6-5 in the
Southern Conference, a half-game
behind fifth-place Appalachian

State, heading into Sunday’s con-
test at The Citadel.

Davidson closed the first half
with a flurry, returning from a 33-
20 deficit with 4:35 remaining to
make a 14-4 run. Jeff Anderson
was the catalyst, scoring seven

straight points ona pair of jumpers _

and a three-pointer. At the half, the
‘Cats trailed 37-34.

Theclubs remained close dur-
ing the first 10 minutes of the sec-
ond half; when George Spain

scored off ofa rebound with 10:29
left, the score was tied at 54.
Davidson would never be as close
again, as the Eagles took off on a
streak of their own.

With just over four minutes
remaining, Jason Zimmerman
missed a three-point shot; the ball
went out of bounds to the home
club. Thinking he had been fouled,
he and Chris Alpert argued with

Women's Hoops Forges Ahead

By Robert Lloyd-Still

The Davidson women’s bas-
ketball team con-
tinues to make
great strides as
the schedule be-
comes more dif-
ficult. After trav-
cling to Lexing-
ton, Va., last
weekend, the
Cats returned
home for games
with Liberty and
Wofford. The
‘Cats began the
week with a 86-
40 trouncing of
Washington and
Lee. Though itis °
only aclub team,
W&L is prepar-
ing for entrance
into Division III.

On Wednes-
day, Davidson
played hard and
showed some
marked improve-
ments. Although
the Cats lost to
Liberty, 71-54,
Davidson was in
the game until
late. Earlier this
scason, the ‘Cats
had lost to the
Flames by twice
that margin, 74-
40. Head coach
John Filar stated
in the Charlotte
Observer, “Lib-
erty is one of the
strongest teams we have faced all
season. They rebound extremely
well and play a very physical
game.”

The Cats played an excellent
first half and led at halftime, 27-
24. After the intermission, Theresa
Bream, sister of Atlanta Brave Sid

Bream, stepped up, and the Flames.

draw a foul as the Davidson starting forward goes up for an easy
two. Although Butcher had 16 points wath 14 rebounds, the 'Cats
lost 71-54 Wednesday night.

Erin Butcher played another fine
game with 16 points and 14 re-
bounds. Coach Filar summed up
the team’s performance in the Ob-
server: “Most important for us in
this game is to put together two
solid halves of play. They have a
very experienced squad, starting

four seniors, but if we play like we
played in the first half of the game,

there’s no rea-
« SON we can’t
come away
with a vic-
tory.”

O an
Saturday
night, things
did not get any
easier for the
‘AC act<s*,
Wofford’s of-
fense was too
much,. and
Davidson lost
70-61.
Wofford came
into Davidson
with 17-3
record and an
amazing aver-
age of 77.3
points per
game. The
game looked
much like the
Liberty one, as
the Cats started
with a flourish
and "only
trailed by two
athalftime, 30-
28. However,
the Cats fal-
tered early in
the second
half, and the
Terriers took
control. At the
end of the
game, the Cats
made a valiant
comeback with two three-pointers
by Maggie Young, but Davidson
fell short. Butcher had another huge
game for the Cats with 20 points 18
rebounds.

The ‘Cats’ next game is at
Western Carolina Wednesday
evening.
