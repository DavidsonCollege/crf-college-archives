Davidson College Goes Big Time!

By Freelove Upthumpa

Inadrastic maneuver designed
to bring Davidson College into the
national spotlight, the Board of
Trustees, upon the recommenda-

teaching’ crap has gotten way out
of hand. Davidson seems to think
that abstract ideals like integrity
and educational merit are more
important than big bucks,” said
new Davidson President Jim Hold-

erman when contacted in his hold-
ing cell in South Carolina.
The new faculty members

include Jerry Tarkanian, former

head basketball coach at the Uni-

Danny Bonaduce, a radio per-

sonality who is best known for his ~~ African-American Literatiiré pro-

childhood roleas Danny Partridge,

Blind Nationalism
"OK!" Says Davidson

_ By Joe Mommah

With the boys and girls com-
ing back to the USA from Saudi
Arabia, the administration of the
E. H. Little Library decided last
week to take down the small rib-
bon in the front window and re-
placeit with areally big one draped
around the whole building. Library
officials offered an explanation,
saying “we wanted to show our
blind nationalism- no, our patriot-
ism- wait, itwas our support for the
soldiers. Wereally wanted to show
our support of our soldiers with
this symbolic gesture.” They were

Athletic Director Holland Cries, Explodes Over Hat Rule

By Angelo McWordup

Amid the flurry of Terry Hol-

land’sexcessive agitation concern-
ing the “No F---ing Hats” policy in
the weightroom, Holland actually
exploded last Friday when two
freshmen refused to take off their
baseball caps. “It wasn’t so much
that they didn’t take off their stu-
pid hats,” said Holland, before he
blew into a million pieces, “what
really made me mad was when
they didn’t bow down tome.” .
Freshman Mike Hunt said he
knew something was wrong when
Holland’s face turned red, then
purple. “His skin started to burst
open. I'said tomy friend Tim who
was with me, ‘Let’s get outta here.
He’s gonnablow.’ Before wecould

sprint even ten feet, I heard the
boom.”

The other freshman, Tim Berr,

said, “I thought he [Holland] was
shooting at us. Turns out he was
exploding.”

Apparently, the two freshmen
had entered the weightroom last
Friday afternoon to “do some
benchpress.” They were finishing
their lastset when Holland walked
in, accidentally banging his fore-

head on the ceiling. Nosooner had:

Mike Hunt and Tim Berr pumped
out their final repetitions, when
“He. looked at us
pretty angry, then he justleft,” said
Tim. :

But ihe came back, and when

he did, he had four MP’s from the °

local Army reserve for back-up.

The two freshman held their
ground. “No,” they said, “we will
not take them off.”

“Yes you will,” said Holland.

“Nope. We won’t.”

A New Gender Studies Program!

By Iaman Hirmeror

: Davidson is starting a new
program next fall entitled Studies
in the Glorification of Men. Men,
men, men. For men, by men, and
about men. The program will fall
under the auspices of The Center
for Interdisciplinary Studies and
beavailableasaconcentrationakin
to Medical.Humanities.

It has been called “‘a positive
step in the return to all that is good

and decent about Western educa- »

tion” in a joint statement issued by

Gail Gibson, Libby Mills, Rose-

marie Tong, Cynthia Lewis, Mary
Thornberry, Sally McMillan, and
Lynn Poland. The statement also
said, “We sure do appreciate all
the stuff men have done for us.”
Guest lecturers that have al-
ready committed their energies to

the studies include Victor Kiam, ;

Clayton Williams, and Andrew

“Y esyouwill.”

“Nowewon’t.

“Will too.”

“Will not.”

This mode of banter endured
for ten minutes until the freshmen
made arun forit, The MP’s shotat
them, wounding Tim Berr in the
ankle and Mike Hunt in the ear-
lobe.:

-When Holland caught up with
them he said the following: “You
know, it’s people like you that make
my amazing, despotic, ego-driven
jobapain in therear. People are so
self-centered sometimes. Man,
why can’t it just be like it used to
be. Why can’t you be like the
clones at U.Va.? Take off your
hats. We didn’t wear them when I

was here.” ;

Apparently, these were the last
words of Terry Holland, for as
soon as he had uttered that last
sentence, he went kaboom--right
after he stopped crying.

“Tt just gocs to show you,” said
the dude who cleancd up the mess,
“people spontancously combust

sion occurs withaccompany ing de-

saying, “I didn’t really mind be-

Funeral services will be held
for Holland’s tongue and tonsil:
