THE DAVIDSONIAN

Flecktones conquer Love Auditorium

By Joun LAMBETH
Guest Writer

On Friday night, a mix of eager Davidson
students and devoted fans from Charlotte and be-
yond gathered in Love Auditorium to spend an
evening with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Five
minutes after the scheduled showtime, the capacity
crowd finally coaxed Bela onto the stage, and the
band kicked things off with a moving version of
“Big Country,” atreat for bluegrass fans. The short
but sweet first set also included “Communication”

and “Oddity,” two other tunes off the Flecktones’
lastest Warner Bros. Release, Left of Cool.

One of the highlights of the first set was anew
instrumental written the newest member of the
band, saxophonist Jeff Coffin. The song presented
a vaguely familiar melody, reminiscent of Rodger’s
and Hammerstein’s “My Favorit Things.” Defi-

nitely the crowning moment of the set was the solo
showcase of talent and imagination put on by
bassist Victor Lemonte Wooten, who demon-
strated just why he has been voted “Bassist of the
Year” by Bass Player magazine for three con-
secutive years,

After a brief setbreak, the crowd resettled
and was anxious for more. Future Man, Victor’s
brother and the Flecktone’s percussionist who
purportedly traveled to Love Auditorium from the
year 2050, opened the second set. with a solo
performance, incorporating a number of instru-
ments and pre-
pared tape
samples. He
had plenty of
tricks inhis bag,
but spent most
of the night on
his hand-crafted
Ssynth-axe
drumitar,
prompting sev-
eral first-time
audience mem-
bers to ask,
“Hey, where are
those drums
coming from?”

T he
band rejoined
Future Man on
stage and got
things cooking again with a socrching perfor-
mance of piano legend Chick Corea’s “Spain.”
This Latin influence was also heard (and verbally
acknowledged by Bela) during anew tune entitled
“Spanish Point.” Perhaps the highlight of the
show. was “Let Me Be the One,” a song that

includes incredibly cheesy vocals by Future Man.
The song also allows lots of room for Bela’s
electric Deering banjo and Jeff’s baritone wah-
wah sax to create some magical interplay.

“Shanti,” with Vic on cello, Bela on sitar banjo,
Jeff on flute, and Future Man on “the box.” The
band returned to encore the crowd favorite and
Grammy-winning “The Sinister Minister,” with

Bela also gave the crowd what they had been
waiting for during his solo portion, as he concluded
by breaking into the familiar “Ballad of Jed

Clampett,” a.k.a. “That song from the Beverly
Hillbillies.” Two new untitled tunes were also
played in the second set: a blues number which
‘ debuted this past fall at Green Acres (woohoo!)

and a brand new song which experimented with
harmonics by Vic and Bela and several time signa-
ture changes. The set ended with a couple of
acoustic numbers, including a beautiful take on

Bela playing the familiar melody on his new toy,
atheremin. Victor really took this bass solo to new
heights and wowed the crowd by spinning his bass
behind his back in mid-solo.

Look for Bela’s new project, a collaboration
with old bluegrass buddies (including Sam Bush,
Tony Rice, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, and
Mark Schatz), to be released this spring. The
Flecktones will continue their East Coast tour
through the end of February, when Bela will take
a break to play a few shows on the West Coast with
Mike Marshall and Edgar Meyer.

Snorkel and dive with Davidson Outdoors

snow white beach to the next. They will sail over
some of Florida’s most scenic coral reefs with
many opportunities to snorkel and dive among the
reefs and the fish which they shelter. This trip is
already full, but there is a waiting list.

The second trip is, unfortunately, not open to
the average Davidson student. This trip is‘a sea
kyaking venture to Sapola Island in southern Geor-
gia. This trip is the final trip for those taking the
Wilderness Leadership training in session one.
There are still spots available for session two, so
similar opportunities are awaiting.

Talk has been made of a Everglades canoe
trip. This trip would be similar to the very popular
one sponsored over Christmas break. Two canoes

of six people each would have the opportunity to-

spend five days island hopping in the waters of
Florida. The trip is, rather, in the mangrove estu-
aries surrounding Everglades City. If living like
Gilligan sounds appealing to you ,call D.O. now to
express your interest in the trip.

If all this seems to overwhelming to you and —

you just don’t feel like you have the time, don’t

t

worry about it. There is always Easter. D.O. is
planning some fun-filled excursions for Easter
break already. There are already three Easter
break options. The first is a sea kayaking trip to
Cape Lookout. Cape Lookout is ‘located on the
end of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. It will
provide an excellent opportunity to enjoy North
Carolina’s finest beaches: The trip leaders for that
are John Bottini and Kristie Hertz.

If you prefer a more rugged retreat, D.O. has
what you’re looking for. There is an alternate
option for all you mountain men and women. This
option is a mountain bike excursion. This trip will
be led by. Kurt Yusi and Kelly Keifer. It will take
riders through some of North Carolina’s best trails
found in the Pisgah and Tsali National Forests.
There is a chance it will reach as far north as West
Virginia and into the New River Gorge.

If sitting on a bicycle seat fora couple of days
straight doesn’t sound like much fun, there is the
final option of paddling down section three of the
Chatooga River. This trip will run for two days
allowing all the time in the world to visit your
family and then get sick of them. Katie Lannon
