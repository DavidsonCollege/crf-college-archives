DIAMOND DUST

Now that the Wildcat dia-
monders have a few gasnes
under their belts, we can get
some idea of the strength of
the team. While the record of
three wins against two losses
is none too impressive, we find
the ’Cats improving with ev-
ery game. With three sopho-
mores and a junior playing his
first year, a certain amount of
erratic play can be expected.

The Clemson game was
hardly a fair test for the Wild-
cats played ina gale, the game
was no contest after the first
inning when three Tigers
reached base by way of walks
before a man was retired. The
*Cats showed some real hitting
strength ~— against Erskine.
Richmond’s erack pitchers and
the midnight ride were a little
too much for the Wildcats.
