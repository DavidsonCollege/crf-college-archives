MRS. R. H. LITTLE

Mrs. Little Brings To Dorms,
Rumple Atmosphere Of Home

Believing that a simple word of
appreciation for a thanklegs job well
done is good, we are moved to
make this public expression of
gratitude to Mrs. R. A. Little.

Mrs, Little came to Davidson in
the fall of 1946 following the resig-
nation of Mrs. N. T. Smith, and
has endeared herself to all those
who have come to know her. From
the start, her job was, as stated,
thankless and hard: the school was
overcrowded, necessitating the
placement of three, sometimes four
students to a room; too, the lean
confussion of war years had left the
dormitories neglected and bare of
fixtures such as curtains, desks and
bookshelves.

Furnishing the rooms is one prob-
lem; but her big puzzel éach year
is how to put, 900 boys in the room
they want with congenial room-
mates of their choice. We concede
there is. no way for room assign-
ment to be done and each student
be perfectly pleased, but we can
say. in a way of praise that Mrs.
Little is never ceasing in her. study
of individual problems, to give the
student what he wants in so far as
possible. Her time is spent in sin-
cere attempt to make living condi-
tions for the student as desirable
as possible.

Should, on a rare visit into. the
dormitories, she’ find a week’s wear
of clothes piled kneedeep — Mrs.
Little administers her most firm
form of discipline: a short, unob-
trusive inoffensive note suggesting
a remedy of the unclean situation.
She does not hesitate to enforce the
dormitory regulations in a business-
like way.

The boys who see most of Mrs.
Little appreciate her zeal and her
encouraging influence. At the first
sign of homesickness or despon-
dency, neither uncommon = even
among Davidson men, she has a
cheering word or bit .of her philo-
sophy to inspire a depressed heart.
Especially she has the capacity to
make the younger arrivals here
feel at home. The sincere personal
interest she takes in each student

affection may remind him of the
care and council his mother would
afford.

The dormitory housekeeping de-
partment has taken on a new effi-
ciency, especially regarding the
daily janitor cleaning, as Mrs. Lit-
tle has quietly gone about making
suggestions and secing that the
work has been well done. It is in
this capacity, coupled with that of
room assignment, ti:at Davidson
was among the first of American
men's colleges to place a woman.
In our opinion this supervision un-
der Mrs. Little has become one
of the attractive features of our
college life and we are uniquely
fortunate to have her services.

As if her duties in the behalf of
the college were not enough she has
gone out of her way to secure suit-
able rooms in private homes for
dates on dance weekends -— a
tremendous aid to the many stu-

Societies For Evils

The dangerous influence wield- |}

!

ed. by sororities and fraternities on
college campuses, is greater today
than ever before, according to Mrs.
Glenn Frank, widow of the former
president of the University of Wis-
consin and a former sorority mem-
ber who has just published the re-
sults of a special investigation in
the February issue of PAGEANT
Magazine.

In “Citadels of Snobbery,” Mrs.
Frank warns that sororities and
fraternities promote a “completely
un-American, undemocratic caste
system.”

She charges that the fraternity
and sorority practice of screening
applicants for membership on the
basis of income, religion and social
position is responsible for innumer-
able personal tragedies. She dis-
agrees with those who brush “away
failure to make a fraternity with
the excuse “That's life,” and points
out that the ingredients for success
in life — ability, courage and in-
dustry, are not considered in select-
ing new fraternity members.

Mrs. Frank reports that frater-
nities and sororities practice relig-
ious discrimination by setting quo-
tas for Catholic students and ban-
ning Jews. As a result, she says,
Jewish students have been forced
to form their own groups, thus cre-
ating segregation on the campus.

While we are spending billions

abroad to save democracy, Mrs.
Frank urges us to spend something
at home to insure democracy. She
calls on the parents of America to.
-get their legislatures to wipe out
fraternities and sororities by legis-
‘lative act. If we fail to do this, she
asks, how can we expect democratic
leaders to emerge from colleges and
universities which have desecrated
that ideal?

Speaking before the VPI Asso-

future engineering graduates that
the common aim of both industry
and the schools is the development
of “better men for the future.”

“The success of any industry de-
pends on its ability to deliver to the
consuming public an ever improved
product or service at a price more
people can afford,” the textile of-
ficial said. “Achieving this requires
constant improvement in methods

leadership.

"Phillips was plainly surprised

campus. According to Dean Dar-
land, “Pacific University students
and faculty have had their oppor-
a{launity to analyze the pronounce-
ments of a professed American
communist. Our job is to continue
to build, with examples, action
and new vigor, our positive answer
to all preconceived dogmas.

“Te may be well to consider that
too much time spent verbalizing and
scrapping with dnd about the

PROF. OSTWALT

Professor Ostwalt
Returns From Leave
(Of Absence at Duke

Prof. J. H. Ostwalt, professor of
education, returned to the campus
this semester after a short leave
of absence. During this leave,
Prof. ‘Ostwalt did) graduate work
at Duke.

Before coming to Davidson last
year, Prof. Ostwalt was assistant
airector of the Bureau of Testing
and Guidance at Duke, the posi-
tion which he again held during
his leave of absence. Also during
the past summer, Prof. Ostwalt
taught Education Psychology in
the first term of summer school at
Duke.

Prof. Ostwalt -is originally from
Statesville. He received his A,B.
degree from Davidson in 1935 and
his M.A. degree from Duke im
1940.

From 1941 to 1946, Prof. Ostwatt
was in the army. His work was with
military personnel adiministratidn.

(Continued on Page Six)

The Burlington ‘official outlined
some of the qualifications which
business today expects of the col-
lege graduate.

A good ‘technical background
achieved through education is an im-
portant’ essential, he said.

“But education alone cannet do
the job. There are plenty of in-
Stances every day of non-college
trained men outstripping some of
the degree men.’

“What's more important are thé
highly complex individual qualities
of business success, qualities which
enable a person to quickly develop
into a position of leadership, he
said,

Examining some of the qualities

business is seeking in choosing its
future ‘executives, Rowe cited four
Principal qualifications: personality
and character traits, an ability to
work with people, a capacity for
making sound and purposeful de-
cisions and judgments, and the
ability to develop and to forceful-
‘express ideas.
\nphasizing the latter point,
Rewe stated that the development
and sefling of ideas “is the core
of the future of any organization.
The man who comes forth with,
sells, and carries to completion the
greatest number and best ideas is
the man who will advance most
rapidly.”

Rowe proposed a closer. cooper-

ation between industry . and the
schools as being the ‘surest formula
for developing the type of indi-
viduals so urgently needed as future
Jeaders in the business world.

Davidson students may well ake
use of, these ideas in) preparing
themselves for work after college
