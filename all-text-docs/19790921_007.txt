Craig Pyles highsteps at the line...

By DAVE DONALDSON
Staff Writer

Southwestern at Memphis
became Davidson's! second vic-
tim in this young 1979 season.
The Wildcats cruised to a
sloppy 42-6 win in a game
marred by turnovers and penal-
Lies. ;

This Saturday, Lafayette, al-
so undefeated, comes to David-
son. Although each game is
viewed as important, the Leo-
pards pose the first serious
threat to Davidson's unblem-
ished record. Lafayette's de-
fense runs from a basic 5-2
alignment with several varia-
tions and stunts. The offense
employs an I-backfield, balan-
cing their attack by running
and passing equally well. Kick-
off time is 1:30 at Richardson
Field.

Davidson's offense played
last Saturday much as they had
against Catawba —starting
slowly before getting on the
track.Although total offensive
yardage was 556 yards, there
were six Davidson fumbles (four
of which were recovered by
Southwwestern) and one inter-
ception. Such a high number of
turnovers would prove disas-
trous against a tough opponent:
But, as Coach Ed FArrell

Cats play poorly but win

and win 42-6, you must be
pretty good.”

Davidson's initial possession
was halted by a fumble. How-
ever, Phil Gilbert intercepted to
get the ball back. Two plays
later, Craig Pyles broke
through the line on a center play
and outran the Southwestern
secondary for a 79-yard score.

Davidson's rushing attack
Look over in the second quarter
as Alvin Atkinson and Ray
Sinclair scored on short runs.
The teams retired for halftime
with the score 21-6.

Gifford Piercy gathered in a
65 scoring strike from Brian
Whitmire to open the second
half scoring. The defense, stop-
ping Southwestern’s offense
cold after their first quarter
score, then scored as: Barry
Cannon ran 40 yards with an
interception.

Reserves played much of the
fourth quarter. The second of-
fense added.the last touchdown
as Leonard Walker punched the
ball in from the one-yard line.

The rushing attack was led
by Craig Pyles (119 yards),
Alvin Atkinson (129 yards),
and Ray Sinclair (88 yards).
Brian Whitmire completed six
of twelve passes for 174 yards

commented after the game, “I as Gifford Piercy picked off four

More garbage from IMAC turkeys Boneheéad and Brick Brothers

By BONEHEAD and
the BRICK BROTHERS

Bonehead and the Brick Bro-
thers, after a night of grain
punch and barking at moving
motorboats on Main Street,
have come to the stark realiza-
tion that the Frosh class is
sitting on its collective cane.
Therefore, as a B and BB public
service activity we have a few
suggestions for the freshmints
to help liven up their first term
at Davidson.

Some of these pranks are in
the history books, but can be
just as delightful if repeated in
proper fashion. We do not
endorse any of these activities,
but merely print them for your
reading pleasure in hopes that
they may be carried out. Fresh-
mints, arm yourselves and take
to the hills!

Here are our suggestions:
1)Fill your laundry bag with
concrete blocks.

. 2)'Tie Butch to the back of your
car and see how fast you can
drag him to Charlotte.
3)Win-a flickerball game(i.e.
Don't play any of the twerps on
your hall.)
4)Steal Sterling Martin's golf
cart and hang it from the
goalpost on Richardson Field.
5)Tie Ed Farrell to Sterling
Martin's golf cart.
6)"'Cirecle up” and form your
own southern-oriented frater-
nity.
7)When asked at a Humes

discussion, tell Abernathy to.

cram it. He will appreciate your
spunk.

4) Burn the E house at 6p.m. on

Thursday.

MStart waterfights. Don't pay .

Will's fine and you may break
znd Belk’s 1978 accrued fine

record of $9,012.13.

10)Buy your books, get a check;
take a test, get a check; take a
dump, get a check. Check it
out!!!

And now for the B andBB
pre-season ratings:

I)SAE: The offending cham-
pions led by peripatetic 5 year
letterman Jim Richards look
formidable again. Imbecilic

‘back Joby Merton may contri-

bute as well if he can find his
supporter. Andy I-MacDonald
should spearhead a tough but
preppy defense. Should go 10-0
and to the Rose Bowl.

2) KA # 1: With the signing
of several free agents and
rookies this team will be able to
fill the vacancies left by gradua-
ting seniors. H. Stockton is a
peripatetic tailback with the
speed of a J. Stroud on uppers.
The offense is as complex as the
synthesis of ribosomal RNA,
but by the end of the season an
organism may form that could

' bea threat to society. Should go

10-0 and to the Rose Bowl.

3)HURTIN 4 CERTIN The
chaotic H.4.C. squad is back
after an unchallenged 3rd _ place
finish in "78. Peripatetic liberta-
rian Minor Sinclair is back from
a 3 month call of nature to
spearhead the club. Former
virgin Mark Carpenter is back
as are token ethnics Vince
Parker and Heywhore Silveira
who were reinstated after re-
monstrative ealls from HEW
and the Immigration Board.
Should go 10-0-and to the Rose
Bowl, :

4JOLD:- MEN: The **Meno-
pause Kids” will-try hard to
muke the championship so they
can get up for the last time. The

peripatetic enforcer *‘Disco
Dave” Shi is back and erstwhile
MacF leet star J. Stroud was
given a token desk job so he
could play. Should go 10-0 and
to the Rose Bowl.

5) WILD ONES: This team is
composed of*peripatetic mem-
bers of the Hole and one loner
from sr frat with the purple
door. Griffith can throw
ce: pines anyone in the
league and his hang time should
allow S. Smith to come from the
Backfield to score in the end-
zone. Should go 10-0 and to the
Rose Bowl.

6)\CARIBOU LIPS: Fresh
from the tundra this grossly
overrated team draws its ran-
king from its peripatetic name.
Nuff said,*‘Kelvin sucks."’
Should go 10-0 and to the Rose
Bowl.

7)BORN TO RUN: These
Bruce Springsteen groupies are
of questionable merit, but have
peripatetic leanings. Their
hopes are better than last year
because they were terrible then
and could not be worse unless
they have declined, Should go
10-0 and to the Rose Bowl.

&RECKLESS ABANDON:
Peripatetic Bear Keith should
be mentioned. Should go 10-0
and to the Rose Bowl.

9)WARKS: 'This peripatic
remnant of the non-KA War
Kiwis and a few guys: that
Risely knows should have a
better than average chance of
playing .500 ball. Jim Kuster,
Mike McGrady, and Haynus
will spread pie on the field.
Should go 10-0 and to the Rose

Stone Mt. Race:

meet Wingate & UNCC next week

By VAN BECK
Staff Writer

The Davidson cross-country
team, paced by senior George
Strobel, overwhelmed Georgia
State Saturday to gain its
initial triumph of the season.
The dual meet, which is annally
run in connection with the
Stone Mountain Invitational
Road Race, was completely
one-sided as the Cats romped
by the score of 19-44 (fifteen is
the lowest possible winning

score in cross-country.)
Strobel, who ran 25:5 over
the five-mile course to slice 50
seconds from his previous best

at Stone Mountain, led the top -

seven finishers, all of whom
covered the course in under 27
minutes. Such depth is unprece-
dented in Wildcat cross-country
history. and ‘led Coach Norman

Koller to. characterize’ this .

year's squad as “easily the
strongest ever at Davidson
College.”

‘The depth of the team can be

Bart Landess, the team's sec-
ond finisher, and Jeff Morrow in
seventh—a scant 42 seconds.
The rush to the finish line
behind Landess was led by
freshman Jack Smith, who was
shadowed by John Hoots and
Danny Armistead. The Morrow
connection, Terry and Jeff,
rounded out the top seven.
Among this group there is but
one senior, the hardworking
Strobel.

Other encouraging perform-

ances were those of Robert

Frierson and Greg Burnard.
