Daring Frosh Team Accepts
Challenge of All-Americans

All-Americans Meet Frosh Team
Friday Afternoon on
Richardson Field

The Freshman football team publicly
accepted the challenge of the All-Ameri-
can squad with a flowery document which
was read in chapel on Friday morning,
October 25. This statement was as fol-
lows:

“We, the members of the Freshman
football squad of Davidson College, wish
to express our unstinted admiration for
those lowly creatures who term them-
selves the All-Americans. And, as for
accepting their challenge, YES.

“Realizing that it took untold courage
and caused many sleepless nights for
them to extend this noble but foolhardy
challenge, we_do extend our heartfelt
sympathy and ‘also our wholehearted
congratulations: sympathy for them in
facing these unsurmountable odds, and

“tongratulations for the daring of their
challenge.

“We are cognizant of the fact that
yeu scheduled this game only because
you were under the impression that
Johnny Rumitback and two other foot-
ball celebrities from Oshkosh School at
Backwash, Michigan, were coming to our
great school to play for you, If, without
these three stars, you still wish to carry
out the original plan, let it be known
through your spokesman and captain,
Bill Quick,

“All right, the die is cast, you have
shown no mercy in your criticism of us.
Therefore you must expect none on the
gridiron.

“In Captain C. C. C. Quick and his
most ardent friend and pardner, Maurice
Peabody, we find a dangerous combina-
tion. As for the play they have christ-
ened Heat—it ain’t so hot. And what is
this we've heard about Tom Thurston
and his “snakey” center sneak. We only
hope they try it. As for K. K. K. Knorr
and his pass receiving—we think he’s a
good cheer leader.

“We have given you a chance to with-
draw your challenge, but you have re-
fused like the noblemen that you are.

“We are sincerely yours until the zero
hour—4 :30 P. M., Friday.

Signed: The greatest and most power-
ful aggregation of football lumina-
ries ever developed in a freshman
class, THE FRESHMAN FOOT-
BALL SQUAD.

INGLE TALKS ON
IFE OF KAGAWA

McMullen Is In Charge Of Open
Meeting Of Student Volun-
teer Group

The Student Volunteer group held a
public meeting in the Social Center, Sun-
day afternoon, led by Dr. Walter L.
Lingle, who spoke on the subject of
Kagawa’s life and work. 6

The meeting was opened by John Mc-
Mullen, who read a passage from the
Bible, and then led off in a series of
sentence prayers. After speaking briefly
of the Student Volunteer Convention, to
be held at Indianapolis, he turned the
meeting over to Dr. Lingle.

Dr. Lingle gave a summary of Kaga-
wa’s life, beginning with his birth, lead-
ing up to his present work. Kagawa was
the son of a Geisha girl, and adopted by
his father. His father died when he was
quite young, and he was adopted by his
uncle, a wealthy business man. His foster
father however, disinherited him when
he became a Christian.

One of the secrets of Kagawa’s power
and success, is the fact that he is an
omnivorous reader, Dr. Lingle said, An-
other is his sincere aim to live absolutely
by Christ's standards. He absolutely re-
fuses to fight or resist, personally, and
does not believe in national resistance.
Kagawa has organized a society whose
goal is one million souls saved for Christ
in Japan.

Kagawa, Dr. Lingle informed the
group, would be at the Student Volun-
teer Convention to be held soon at In-
dianapolis, Indiana. The furthest south he
is intending to come in his tour will be
Memphis.

The meeting was closed with the Miz-
pah benediction.

Future Ministers Are
Invited To Conference

At a called meeting of the Ministerial
Band, Sunday, Oct. 27, a letter was read
inviting the Davidson Band to join, and
send delegates’ to a conference of all
North Carolina Ministerial groups to be
held Saturday, Nov. 2, at Catawba Col-
lege.

Seven of the fourteen present signified
their intention to go to Catawba, if pos-
sible. A discussion was then held concern-
ing a stunt to be given at Catawba.

It was decided that all those intending
to go to Catawba, should let the Secre-
tary, Loch Vass, know definitely whether
or not they could go, by Tuesday morn-
ing, Oct. the 29th.

The meeting was dismissed with the
Mizpah Benediction.

DA. HOOD TELLS
OF flo HOBBIES

Workshop Contains Various Ar-
ticles Made By the Genius
Of Dr. Hood

Last week someone made the sugges-
tion that some articles be written on the
hobbies cultivated by our professors.

We decided to call first on Dr. Fra-
zier Hood. In his study we sat cheek by
jowl with a massive table, almost big
enough for playing ping-pong. We in-
quired whether it was an antique, but
he told us that he had made it from some
plans given him by an F.R.S. when he
was in England recently. It is constructed
of beautiful oak, not stained, but treated
with potassium dichromate, which was
then ‘set with a linseed oil—a treatment
which Dr. Hood says he has not seen
used elsewhere.

The room is practically packed with
other examples of his ingenuity—a small
but exquisite writing-cabinet made of
cherry, under the window, and a diction-
ary stand that is not at all the ordinary
lectern, but has drawers that serve, one
as a smoking cabinet, roomy enough, it
looked, to grow the tobacto, and another
for his drafting tools. Why the drafting
tools, you ask? It seems the inclined sup-
port for the lexicon is anchored only by
pegs; take it off with the atlas that re-
poses cosily beneath it, and there is the
place for a drawing-board.

There is also a heavy wooden contrap-
tion that looked like a short, high kneel-
ing bench from some ancient English
Church, Dr. Hood with a pocket rule he
carried measured the original of this
piece im the British Museum after he had
made the copy from an illustration, and
he found that his guesses had proved ex-
actly correct.

On the left-hand side as one enters the
room there is an unusual exhibit—an icon,
framed by a breath-taking piece of in-
tricate and skillful carving, forming a
miniature portal supported by two fluted
Corinthian columns. ‘Trying to gather
some words to express our admiration,
we were forestalled by his explanation
that it was the work of Dr. Raynal of

Library Adds New
Books To Shelves

The library has recently added several
new books to its shelves, including fic-
tion, biography, and politics.

Notable among these is the best seller,
Green Light. In this book Lloyd C.
Douglas portrays many interesting char-
acters, including Dr. Newell Paige, a
young surgeon who has ruined a brilliant
career to shoulder another’s blame. Phyl-
lis Dexter, who thought the man she
loved had been responsible for her moth-
er’s death and Dean Harcourt, who be-
lieved that love was a gift and hate a
disease, are among others who play their
part in the dramatic sweep of “Green
Light” to its happy ending.

Mary, Queen of Scotland and the
Tsles, by Stefan Sweig, tells a fascinating
story of Mary and the great tragedy of
her life.

The history of another great woman
is told by Queen Marie of Roumania in
her autobiography, Ordeal, the Story of
My Life. Regarding this book the New
York Times said, “Never before has the
curtain which screens the life of royalty
from the public gaze been more daringly
elevated. Episode succeeds episode in a
moving narrative of events.

In his book The New Imperative,
Walter Lippman discusses the ‘Perma-
nent New Deal” in an effort to discover
whether the many experiments of the
past six years are merely a response to
a passing emergency, or whether they
signify lasting changes in the relation
between government and the economic
order.

Vein of Iron, by Ellen Glasgow, deals
with a modern story whose background
is the Great Valley of Virginia.

leads a young archaeologist, Brian
Aherne, into romance for a lark. Later,
after he chases her to New York, she
