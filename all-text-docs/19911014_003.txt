qualified member” of the honor
system and could be called to siton
ajury. Stone also voiced her con-
cerns over the present system re-
quiring of students a “fearful re-
spect of the unknown”. The sys-
tem should be replaced by one that
emphasizes “trust and confidence”
according to Stone.

Stone felt that the implemen-
tation of a self-selected jury sys-
tem would “bridge the gap” she
sees now between the honor coun-
ciland students. Inaddition, Stone
felt that ‘the jury’ process would
allow for interested students to be
brought into ‘the honor system
process. “We are a part of the
honor system and should not just
be subject to the code,” Stone said.

Howell followed Stone and
thanked those in attendance for the
opportunity to express student
concerns directly to the council.
“Tt is important to rededicate our-
selves to look at the present sys-
‘tem, and to make it better,” Howell
said, “but, as chair, I will not par-
take in anything that will diminish
this system.” He emphasized spe-
cifically his unwillingness to sac-
rifice the right to be tried by those
students elected to the honorcoun-

cil. “

Howell went on to say that he
“will not remain on the council if
the system is changed.” Howell
also discussed his role as honor
council chair, to serve as a“devil’s
advocate” in cases and explore all
comers and possibilities in cases.

After the opening presentations
of the panelists, the forum was
opened to questions by students.

~ David Johnson-began- the discus-
sion by addressing the lack of

« familiarity of the code among stu-
dents. Howell noted that he share d
many of the same concerns.

The discussion progressed onto
the logistics of installing a jury
system. Thompson mentioned that
a jury system would individualize
each case and would preventcoun-
cil member’s objectivity from be-
coming diluted after repeated honor
cases. Foxx contended that objec-
tivity is not a problem with the
council as the rotation of members
for honor trials helps to maintain a
“fresh perspective”.

The discussion then turned to
the idea to include more students
in the honor code processes. “‘The

’ desire to be involved in the system
is obvious with the number of
people who sign up to run for the
honor council, people want to be
involved,” senior Steven Lilly said.

John Patton, student solicitor

for the honor council, expreseed
his concerns with opening up the
process to the general student body.
Patton was worried that a jury
system would jeopardize confiden-
tiality of the council trial process.
Patton said that as the council works
now, there are ramifications for
members who break the silence of
a case, their dismissal from the
council. With the jury system,

Patton felt there would be little to

protect the confidentiality of acase.

Covington closed the discus-
sion, saying that the SGA, the
Student Conduct Counciland Dean
Will Terry will be looking at the
issue over the next several weeks.

Jay Neal focused primarily on
