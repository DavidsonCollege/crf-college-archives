THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 11, 1933

Philanthropics Have
Temperance Debate

A debate on the repeal of the eight-
eenth amendment was the feature of
the Philanthropic Literary Society
meeting Tuesday night. Miller Coch-
ran and Sid Morrison defended the
affirmative and Bill Johnson and C. O.
McNeill assumed the negative in the
opening debate of the year. The cen-
tral thought of this timely theme was
“would the cause of temperance be
promoted or hurt by the repeal of the
prohibition amendment?” The argu-
ment was very spirited, affording a
good start for the coming year’s en-
deavor.

Also on the program was a talk on
the history of the Philanthropic So-
ciety by Courtney Ross. In his talk
he portrayed the prominent part the
society has played on the campus since
its founding in 1837.

The attendance of the first meetings
has been-unusualiy good, a large pro-
portion of the freshmen showing in-
terest in the society.

Initial Edition of

Yow! Goes to Press|.

Thatbancient, time-honored organ of
accidental origin, the offspring of one
Chameleon, endured by a long-suffer-
ing critic’s organization, to-wit, the
Davidson student body, has gone to
press.

Amd cajolings, threats, groans, and
what-not, the magazine has finally
left the editor’s hands and must face

the cold, cruel world alone. Even
while arguments were going on as to
the contents of this initial issue, the
Yow! slipped unobtrusively out of the
spacious office which bears its name
and, once out, ran to the printer for
dear life, afraid that there would be
nothing left in it after the blue pencil
society had done its work. Another
magazine, made from rejected material
is NOT for publication!

In the words of the first editor of
this illustrious Yowl, “If we can shed
a little sunshine into the otherwise
drab and monotonous life of books,
classes, and lectures, we are satisfied.”
More, we have performed a service,
we have done our duty, we have car-
ried enlightenment, we have opened up
new—SAY, DON’T GO WAY! Well,
anyhow the YOWL is coming!

Music Departments
Gain in Recognition

Regular Weekly Engagements
Made With Charlotte Station
for Broadcasts

Mr. Pfohl, who has just taken charge
of the music department of the school,
has improved it very much. Many
more students than previously are tak-
ing an interest in the different forms
of music. Mr. Pfohl carried the con-
cert band over to Charlotte two weeks
ago, where it broadcast over WBT.
After much work, Mr. Pfohl secured
a weekly date with WBT to broadcast.
The time was changed from Monday

evening until Wednesday evening from
8:30 till 8:45.

The quartet, which is composed of
Hubert Morris, first tenor; J. A. C.
Robinson, second tenor; Frank Tuck-
er, baritone; Dave McLain, base, will
broadcast over WBT tonight at 8:30.

The program is as follows: “O Da-
vidson,” “O No John” (English Folk
Song), “Drink To Me Only With Thine
Eyes” (Old English Air), will be sung
by the quartet, after which Frank
Tucker will sing a baritone solo. Dave
McLain will then sing a bass solo.
The quartet will then sing “Short’nin
Bread,” by Wolfe, and “A Brown
Bird Singing,” by Wood, which will
conclude the program.

Until further notice the broadcast of
the music department will be on
Wednesday evening from 8:30 till 8:45.

CLEMSON WINS IN GAME
WITH N. C. STATE, 9-0

(Continued from page 5)

But then two long passes by Repasky,
Indian back, paved the way,for the

Newberry score, and Lambeth place-
kicked the extra point. With only
five minutes left, the Bulldogs made
a steady drive from Newberry’s 36-
yard line to drive over a touchdown.
A line play earned the extra point.

The contest between William and
Mary and Washington and Lee was
marked with thrills from the opening
minutes when the Generals scored
after a 55-yard run-back of a William
and Mary punt to the end of the final
period when the Indians passed eight
times in a wild attempt to score. Both
teams made eight first downs, but
Williams and Mary was unable to gain
much yardage, except for passes com-
pleted at intervals.
