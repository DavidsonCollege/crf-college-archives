Morning After pill
no longer offered
at Health Center

By MATTHEw Erricu
Staff Writer

The Student Health Center no
longer dispenses the Morning Af-
ter pill.

Health Educator Georgia
Ringle calls the movea “big change
this year” and is concerned stu-
dents are not aware of it.

In the past students could re-
ceive the pill directly from the doc-
tors who worked in the Health
Center. However, the medical
group which is currently staffing
the Health Center will not pre-
scribe the medication.

Ringle explains that when the
contract with Lake Norman Fam-
ily Medicine group was negotiated
last year the availability of the
Morning After pill was left out.

Students can receive a referral

from the Health Center to see a
doctor who will prescribe the pill,
but, Ringle says, students should
call the morning after unprotected
intercourse so an appointment can
be made.

The cost is $85 for the first trip
and $55 for the following visit.

The medication makes the
uterine lining incompatible for the
egg to implant itself. Ringle has-
tens to point out that this pill is not
the controversial RU486 abortion
pill.

The Morning After pill is most
effective if taken within 72 hours
of unprotected intercourse.

Ringle hopes the Health Cen-
ter will begin offering the Morning
After pill again in the next school
year, “because this is a service the
college has provided in the past
several years.”

Davidson alum
speaks on conditions
in El Salvador

By ADAM Hickey
Staff Writer

“Health as reconciliation” was
the motto repeated throughout the
lecture held to educate listeners on
conditions in El Salvador.

Dr. Lanny ‘Smith, a 1985
Davidson graduate, spoke on his
experiences in El Salvador on
Wednesday night. Smith has spent
the last three years working for
Doctors of the World, a French
humanitarian organization which
provides medical care throughout
the Third World: Smith was spon-
sored by Davidson’s chapter of
Amnesty International and the
Dean Rusk Program.

An English major who in-
tended to become a writer, Smith.
traveled to Nicaragua after gradu-
ation. He was so inspired he de-
cided to return to Central America
during and after his study at the
Medical College of Georgia.

Smith, who spends much of
his time working in a rural area of
the country known as Moraz6n,
spoke regarding the philosophy of
medicine he practices: Commu-
nity Oriented Primary Care
(COPC).

In their efforts, he and his fel-
low doctors combine concern for
national health issues with one-on-
one preventative and curative pri-
mary care.

Speaking at length on the re-
cent history of events in El Salva-
dor, Smith stressed that “health is
a political matter.” He hopes to

tions from the audience, composed
of students, faculty, and commu-
nity members. “I’m here looking
for information,” he said.

Stating repeatedly that “you
have to go where the people are,”
Smith stressed a hands-on ap-
proach, yet he emphasized an ap-
propriate division of responsibil-
ity: “I think it’s very important the
Ministry of Health do its work.”

His organization often pres-
sures the government to do its job,
which proves to be a more effec-
tive method than simply picking
up the slack for it.

Smith also stressed education
for the sake of self-sufficiency. “If
you create a dependency and then
leave, you haven’t done a lot of
good,” he said.

Audrey Edmundson, Presi-
dent of Davidson’s Amnesty Inter-
national, stated that Smith was
chosen to speak because, “his ide-
als and vision coincide with those
of Amnesty ... to promote educa-
tion as to human rights abuses oc-
curring worldwide.”

Town meetings reveals
minors still dubious issue

’ By Kerry Bropuy

Staff Writer

The Council on Academic
Affairs, members of the SGA, fac-
ulty, and concerned students gath-
ered to discuss a revised proposal
for the integration of minors into
Davidson’s academic curriculum.
The debate reaffirmed student sup-

port for and faculty. objections to
minors.

The faculty voted against the
original minors proposal last
spring. They were partially con-
cerned that minors would require
an implausible amount of work,
would increase parental pressure,
and would compromise the
college’s liberal arts curriculum.

The Council on Academic
Affairs, co-chaired by Kathryn
Voyer and Clair Freeman, will in-
troduce a revised proposal to the
faculty next semester, providing
that the Educational Policy Com-
mittee permits its submission.

This amended version at-
tempts to address many of the
faculty’s concerns and includes
some of the following provisions:
minors will remain optional, be
restricted to double majors and
those in a concentration, require a
2.0 GPA, and be limited to one
minor per student.

Attending faculty expressed

concern about the pressures that
minors might inflict on students,
especially during their last semes-
ter. Moreover, they fear that the
quality of instruction, discussion,
and work might decrease in high
level classes as minors funnel into
these courses.

They also contended that the

ideal of a liberal arts education —

would be corrupted by anincreased
requirement of specific courses.

Students cited numerous ar-
guments in favor of minors.
Kathryn Voyer stated, “The struc-
ture of minors might give [stu-
dents] amore broad discipline than
concentrations.”

Students also felt that minors
will be advantageous in the job

market and at graduate schools, as
they might provide for more com-
prehensive and competitive re-
sumes. Many emphasized that
Davidson students already take five
to seven classes in a specific area,
thereby fulfilling a minor require-
ment.

The future of minors at
Davidson remains unclear. Phi-
losophy Chair Dr. Lance Stell, who .
was at the meeting, said he is “re-
ally concerned that we may not
feel comfortable bringing the pro-
posal back to the faculty after what

‘happened last spring.”

However, attending faculty
members emphasized their will-
ingness to consider student input
regarding this issue.
