Shuts out StAndrews

Blazing Barr baffles batters

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

This past week the Wildcat
baseball team liad a four-game
winning streak. The streak
was led by senior Tim Barr’s
pitching performance in two
games.

The first was an impressive
Cat win of 22-0 over St.
Andrews. Barr, who is basi-
cally a power pitcher, hurled
the ball past most of the St.
Andrews hitters. This was

This year has been a most
frustrating one for the team of
Bad Bernard and Hogman.
Both of our teams got knocked
out of the tourney, and then to
put the icing on the cornbread,
those Roads Scholars from
down on Highway 49, better
known as UNC-Carowinds
have taken our reservations at
the Peachtree Plaza.

If Chad Kinch continues to
play like the missing link and
Cornflake keeps bringing the
ball upcourt, we may be
reading about pep bands and
airport receptions for the next
ten years. *

It has been a wet week at
D.C. soa majority of games
have been rained out. How-
ever, there are several of note.:
Off Again continued their
winning tradition by whipping
the freshmen War Kiwis 11-6.

Wood’s Hole downed Wee

Willy and the Wahoos 9-4 as
Sikes McCord showed that the
W’s on his hat stood for Wimp
instead of Willy.

Those do nothings of Embo
finally won something as they
kicked the Furry Little Ani-
mals 23-10. Pat Hickert struck
out twice in a row on six
straight pitches but the Fiji’s
ignored him and beat One
Track Mind 7-3.

The Cannonballs let their
pre-season press go to their
heads and barely nipped Ema-
non 7-6 while Rock and Roll
Sunoco showed that alcohol
and winning often go hand in
hand as they slowed Buck’s
Truck Stop 15-4.

The Gozinyas buried Last
Rites 14-4, the Brewers
crushed Sigma Phi Nothing
18-3, M&M exploited the Hic-

kies 27-2, the Flaming A’s’

shutout Night Train Express
10-0 and the KA’s humbled
4th Richardson 14-0.

It has been a past tradition

at Davidson that every spring
the IMAC all-stars play the
Davidson JV’s. Seeing that
there is no junior varsity, the
illustrious red team of the
varsity, those creatures who
never play in games, has
accepted the challenge.

The game, tentatively
scheduled for 7:30 in Johnston
Gym on April 12th, should be
a sellout so get your tickets
early...

Tygimac all-stars this
year Will be eight chosen by
John Wooden and four other
candidates chosen at large.
The eight are: Rob Murray,
John McArthur, Dick Myrick,
Charlie Taylor, Adrian/Wil-
son, Mike Peskosky, Cory
Young and Rick Harhart.

Y’all get to select the other
four so send your ballots to
“Hogman”’,, Box 1755, David-
son. You don’t want to miss
this first annual Bad Bernard-
Hogman benefit game—see
you there. Later.

evident in the shut-out as Barr
struck out 14 of the St.
Andrews batters. In so doing,
he allowed only three hits.
Barr has always been an
asset to the Wildcat baseball
program. As a freshman he
posted a 1-1 record. His

WILDCAT pitching has
been a strong point this
year. (Irv Wilson)

sophomore year he pitched in
seven games and tallied an
impressive 6-1 record.

Last year was unfortunate
for the junior hurler, as a knee
injury put him out of action
early in the season. Despite
the injury, he managed to
pitch a 3-3 record. Knee
surgery over the summer has
corrected the injury and the
senior ‘‘ace” of the Cat staff
seems to be at 100 percent.

showed through this week in a
second win led by Barr. This
was an impressive 4-1 victory
over last year’s Southern Con-
ference Champion, Furman
University. Barr allowed only
four hits as he consistently
kept Furman’s hitters off-
stride. He did this by moving
his pitches around and by
varying the speed of his
pitches.

This kept Furman’s hitters
guessing and was instrumen-
tal in the conference win. This
week’s victories move Barr’s
personal record to an impres-
sive 4-2 record. :

Joining Barr in this week’s
victories was the strong pit-
ching of sophomore Ron Can-
non and junior Tim Purcell.
Cannon, a strong ‘‘southpaw”’
led the Cats to a 7-6 victory
over Lenoir-Rhyne. Purcell
threw an impressive 2-0 shut-
out in the second game of the
double-héader with Furman.

Purcell is a strong fastball
pitcher who also has an excel-
lent curve-ball. The strength
of both of these pitchers was
seen in the Furman game.as
Purcell allowed only two hits.

Coach Palmer Muench had
this to say about the Cats’
three starting pitchers, “All
three pitchers, and particular-
ly Barr, have thrown well all
season, but it wasn’t until
recently that the team’s de-
fense has consistently suppor-
ted the staff.”’.

Muench feels the defense
has finally come around and
because of this, combined with
the excellent pitching, the
team should continue to have
success.
