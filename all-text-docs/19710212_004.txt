Free Speech Defended

The controversy over the decision of the senate
to invite Rennie Davis to speak on campus raises im-
portant issues of freedom of speech and the role of
the Davidson student senate.

One of the. chief complaints about the senate’s
handling of the Davis appearance has been the failure
of the senate to ask for the opinions of the student
body.

‘The senate is a deliberative body which serves
a decision making function. It is the function of the
senate which has been misconstrued in the current
argument. The senate is not an agency for setting up
referendums on each issue which comes before it.

It is legitimate for students to ask why the sen-
ators have voted for the Davis appearance and express
to the senators their feelings’on the issue, but they
should not expect to change the senate’s vote by work-
ing outside the senate.

The key issue here, however, may be the an
cit question of free speech. It has been objected that
Davis is a convicted criminal, that he advocates the
overthrow of the United States government and that
he will be detrimental to the reputation of the college.
This is supposed to show him unfit to appear at Da-
vidson College as a speaker.

This is one way to characterize the appearance
of a man who is not. typical of Davidson, Davidson
College speakers or perhaps the mainstream of Ameri-
can life as a whole.

But to declare him unfit to speak here is to hide

our heads in the sand and pretend that the world is‘

a lot less complex and involved than we sometimes
read in “Newsweek” or “Time.” Davis represents an
alternative Kfe style and a different prospective from
which we can look at our social institutiens.

To say that the government disagrees with Davis’
opinion to the point of convicting him and the others
of the “Chicago Seven” is not to say that what he has
to say is not worthwhile.

In inviting Davis the senate has finally opened
up the potential of the college to raise issues and pre-
sent provacative opinion.

The arguments against the appearance of Rennie
Davis should not lead to a suspension of free speech
on campus, a freedom which the college has shown
all to little eagerness to exercise.

Non Loco Parentis

As has happened often over the past year, Cecil
Burney and his Residence Hall Council have become
involved in another: controversy concerning dormitory
life and regulations.

Ignoring warnings that such action would only
serve to re-open old wounds by leading to a more ag-
gressive administration policy concerning dorm visita-
tion by women, the RHC has. officially declared that
the Davidson residence halls will be open 24 hours,
seven days a week to all guests of Davidson students.

We .support the content of the decision, °since
we feel that completely open dorms are essential if
the college is to function socially. Also, it should be
remembered that last year over 90 per.cent of the
student body voted in-favor of open dorms and against
any “in loco parentis” policy of the administration.

There is, however, a deeper issue involved in the
RHC’s action, and it is important that it be brought
into the open.

By voting to make the dormitories open to guests
at all times, the RHC has come into direct conflict

_ With the administration, and especially with Dean of
Students Will ‘Terry. Such conflict with the admin-
istration, of course, is not new or unusual. However,
the clash will be the first major crisis that Terry has
had to face as the new dean, and hopefully the results
will be different from those of past encounters. —

For the response by Terry and the rest of the -

administration to the RHC’s decision will indicate their
willingness to consider
authority in‘the upcoming decisions concerning pos-
sible campus governance. eae,

If Davidson does iatend to stick to a concept of

commiunity government, then it should seriously con- |

_,Sider letting the students play a large role in deter-

ng regulations concerning their life as members
of this community. We urge the administration of the
. college to recognize this need for student governance
_ when it considers the action of the-RHC

Everybody’s Grandmother
Can Find Work At College

By CECIL BURNEY

Have. you ever wondered
what’s wrong with David-
son? Well:

Davidson College employs
more than 50 of its own
graduates. More than one-
fourth of the faculty are Da-
‘vidson graduates. The col-
lege has..14 preachers.

(Many of Davidson’s em-

ployees are related to one

another.

‘Mr. Kimbrough’s family,
for example, is widely
spread across the campus.
Professor Richie King in the
math department is married
to Mr. Kimbrough’s daugt¥
ter, ‘Mary.

(Mr. Kimbrough’s son Law-
rence is the trust officer at
the Piedmont Bank and
Trust Co., where. the col-
lege stores its money. And
Tish Kimbrough is. Frontis
Johnston's daughter, as well
as secretary to the Dean of
‘Students.

Professor King’s full name
is (Lunsford Richardson
King. He is related to the
famous Richardson family
which provided Davidson
with Richardson Dormitory,
Richardson Field, the Rich-
ardson Scolars program, and
the Richardson Fellows pro-
gram. The Richardson fami-
ly made a fortune selling
Vick’s Vapo4Rub. This is, al-
so the family of Congress-
man Richardson Preyer.

But another interesting
fact is that Sam Spencer’s
wife Ava is connected with
the Richardson family, too!

In 1969, Howard Arbuckle
III, a Davidson grad, was
hired as Alumni Director,

‘He is Dell Logan's nephew. .

Dell Logan -is Scott Wood:
mansee’s secretary and is
the wife of Professor T. S.
‘Logan. of the chemistry de
partment. Arbuckle’s grand-
father used to teach here.
But the most complex re-
lationship of them all is the
one between H.. Edmunds
White, Director of Admis-
sions, and his brother, Pro-
fessor Locke White. Both
Ed and Locke are David-
son's grads. Ed White's nep-

- how (Locke’s son) recently

married -Scotty WNicholl’s
daughter. And Ed White's
old fraternity brother during
their days together at Da-
vidson just happens to be
Bob Currie, College Trea-
surer.

On the surface, this may
not seem so bad. But it
means the Director of Ad-
missions is in some way re-
lated to the Chairman of the
physics department, and to
the Director of Student
Housing, and one of his best
friends is the college trea:
surer.

Ed White is busily trying
to be one of Sam Spencer's
best friends. They play ten-
nis frequently (Ed lets Sam
win, occasionally),.and it is
well known that Sam -con-
fides in Ed White more than
anyone but Shaw Smith. Sam
‘Spencer was the ‘best man”

at Shaw's _ wedding. And.

Shaw was thé’ “best ‘infan’’
at Sam’s wedding,.;....- .

ty team has found its place
in the psychology depart-
ment — Russ Walls and his

' Mrs. Burts, the wife of our
Registrar, runs the Audio-
Visual Department. C. W.
Stacks, Director of the Laun-
dry, has put his wife Ger-
trude on the payroll in the
laundry. Coach Harry Fog-
leman’s’ wife works in the
library, and the wife of
ROTC teacher Robert Bag-
gett works for Mrs. Nicholls.
Scotty Nicholls, Director
of Student. Housing, is book-
store manager Peter Nic-
holls’ wife, of course. Pro-

LETTERS

fessor Lindsey’s wife works
in the language lab. And
Klaus Kleeburg's wife, Jean-
nie (you know her as “the
silver fox’’), works’ with
Klaus in the cafeteria.

Last, and probably least,
is the fact that Sam’s minis-
ter at his church in Virginia
when,»he ran Mary Baldwin
ColHege was none other than
Peter Hobbie’s father. And
last year, Sam _ persuaded
the faculty to give his’ old
preacher an honorary degree
from Davidson.

It, is a well-known that in-
breeding in a family — even
in one big “happy"’ family
like ours at Davidson —
leads to idiocy and mental
retardation.

To the Editor:

‘Ever spend part of an
hour talking toa professor,
not about courses, but about
education? I did, one arfter-
noon, with a science profes-
sor who, I feel, understands
more about education than
the large majority of our fa*
culty. But why mention such
a man? Let us examine a
few facts.

The man has an acute un-
derstanding of ‘the student
and his plight in college. He
understand that the key to
process
must fall to the student, and
not the so-called ‘'teachers.”’
‘He understands that stu-
dents have interests (most-
ly educational) that they
would like to pursue, if they
weren't so boxed in by the
present system.

‘He has written proposals
and presented them to the
EPC in hopes of providing
the student with a path out
of the mire of quicksand.
Though many are recom-
mended by the EPC, few
ever get off the ground, pro-
bably becase of their inno-
vativeness and uniqueness
(that is, they process), and
also because they may be
just a little too bold for the
more ‘‘cautious’’ members
of the faculty.

And should one of his. pro-
grams be _ implemented,
(and one of them is in ope-
ration now), it is so misin-
terpreted and redone that it
bears no semblance to what
it was intended to be. Even
in his. . constant disappoint-
ment, he keeps: his ideas
coming in hopes of stimulat-
ing the thinking of his col-
legues, who seem to never
hear him.

It is about jtime .David-
son's. faculty stopped living
in the Dark Ages. The fa-

culty does not hold the key

to our education. In many

instances, they bar our pre-

Sress instead. Teaching is

.an art ‘which few : practice

here..
To guide a student, to ex-

cite him, to encourage him
is teaching, but the pompous
action of a man allowing us
the benefit of His gracious-
ness by imparting his know-
ledge is sickening.

Knowledge exists every-
where_in Davidson's facul-
ty. The problem is that
there is very little wisdom
‘present. Wisdom ‘is: some-
thing that distinguishes be-
tween the mechanical teach-
er and the true teacher.
There. are few teachers
here.

This professor is truly 4
wise ifian: There die tliat
handful of his collegues who
share his’ gift. Ironically,
the professor commented to
me, half jokingly, and half
seriously, that he would
leave if he had a better
teaching offer. He is one of
the few lights in this educa-
tional pool of darkness. For
Davidson's sake, I hope he
stays. For his sake...

To the Editor: |

-The purpose of this letter
is two-fold. My first intent
is to, clarify the inability ‘to
obtain a verifiable recount
in the SGA election of Jan.
27. I am fully responsible.

My error was one of
judgment, in that I judged
the lists to be an inadequate
check on election results.
However, I . shouldn't. have
removed that check, even if
inadequate, until I replaced
it with another.

Since that election a new
system has been initiated
and the opportunity for .a
voter to vote more than once
is considerably less.

The second purpose. of this

letter is to, think Tom Ver-

non for running the comput-
er in tabulating election re-
sults. With no office or pay.
Tom spent many hours set-
ting-up- and. helping to. run
elections. His effort deserves
public acknowledgement.
