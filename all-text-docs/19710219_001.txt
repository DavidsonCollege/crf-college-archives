Six Fraternities Consider Leaving Campus
Selectivity Seems Sure To Survive

AN ANALYSIS
By RUSS MERRITT
Co Editor-in-Chief

Davidson's selective fra-
ternity system, which had
appeared to be down and
out for the final count, is
making a_ strong . comback
and has returned to the fray
with-some new ammunition.

At least six of the twelve
national fraternities are
seriously considering  con-
tinuing operations off cam-
pus, and at least one has re-
portedly decided to maintain
eating facliities away” from
the campus.

Such action would appear
* to be contradictory to the
guidelines laid down by the
trustees of the college last
fall concerning MDavidson's
social system.

The trustees stated that no
selective fraternity of David-
- son students should be allow-
ed to set up eating and liv-
ing facilities away from the
campus.

The Committee of 18, in
its official report on the fu-
ture of the fraternities at
Davidson, echoed the desires
of the trustees, offering the
fraternities four options for
their. continued existence.
Maintaining eating and liv-
ing facilities off campus
was not included among
these options.

Until recently, none of the
fraternities had officially de-
clared that it would choose
the third option offered, con-

cerning... continuing . opera-
tions off campus. Neither -
had any house made de-

finite plans to reject the col

In the new election, ‘‘only

book Davis, the* newly-elect-
ed student Senate was then
confronted by a_ petition
from senior Chip DuRant.

DuRant had secured nine
more than the 100 required
signatures, beginning at 7:00
that same morning.

SGA President Danny
Clodfelter clarified the enga-
gement, stating that the con-
tract was presently in the
mail and not yet: irrevocable
if the referendum carried.

In the contract Davis will
give a,one hour speech on
‘March 1 and also be avail-
able the following day to
meet with any classes for
discussion, It has been stip-
ulated that che not partici-
pate in a public debate.

Clodfelter added that the
senate was presently seeking
to secure another conserva-
tive speaker, specifically re-
ferring to ‘syndicated colum-
nist James J. Kilpatrick,
-whom he said could be book-
ed with little trouble or ex-
pense.

Clodfelter commented on
the fee for Davis, saying
that the average (Reynolds
lecturer cost around $1,500
but that the senate had
brought two speakers to the
campus before without any
fee.

DuRant elaborated for
about 15 minutes on his op-
position to Davis as a paid
speaker, citing a faculty poll
a statement by College Pre-
sident Samuel R. Spencer
Jr., remarks by Davis him-
self, and several letters
from alumni trustees, and
other. supporters of David-
son College.

The polling of 22 faculty
members produced the fol-
lowing. results: 13 ‘‘disap-
prove,’’ 1 ‘‘deplores,’’ 3 ‘‘ap-
prove,’ 3 approve : Davis
but not the price, 2 made
lengthy. comments against
Davis, and 2 felt that it was
the business -of the students
to decide and not the facul-
ty.

Spencer's , statement’ on
Davis deplores the ‘‘exhorbi-
tant price’’ being paid to
bring Davis here and calls
his procurement a ‘‘conces
sion to sensationalism.”

Other letters
Davis and his
philosophy,"’

denounced
“cancerous
referring to
him as “a radical criminal
at large, anti<American and
anti-Christ.”

DuRant urged the senate
to remember its commit-
tment to the students, point-
ing to the lack of publicity

which characterized the
former SGA _ decision on
Davis. He added that no

minutes or announcements
were released by the senate
and that ‘many — students
were surprised. to receive
my letter 1% weeks after
his selection." :
(DuRant concluded: ‘'I pre-
sent this to you, a senate
who say they want to re-
present the student body,
and I think that rejecting
this speaker will help the

image of Davidson College
in the eyes of the trustees,
alumni, faculty, and the
students,”’

In addition to the actual
vote which followed, Clod-
felter went on record as be-
ing against the motion.

The SGA Elections—Board
determined the wording of
the petition as it will be
printed on the ballot: ‘‘The
SGA senate has authorized
the expenditure of $1,000 to
bring Rennie Davis to speak
at ‘Davidson on March 1. Do
te approve of this action?

Yes Wo.

The Senate Constitution
and Bylaws Committee in-
terpreted the 2/3 rule for
passage of the referendum
to mean that fraction of the
entire. student ‘body rather
than just 2/3 of those stu-
dents who vote.

In order to insure a large
vote on tthe referendum the

(RHC) will handle the elec-
