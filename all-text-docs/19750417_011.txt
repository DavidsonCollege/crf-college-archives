Freshman Grady Barnhill returns a volley from a
Pfeiffer College foe. The Cats hosted Pfeiffer on
Tuesday and took a 9-0 nonconferance victory. This
gave the Cats a two-game winning streak.

lead -this division, although
they have yet to play the

The Beavers, led by hard-
hitting Steve Fabian and the
pitching of tall, distinguished,

Delts, 8-3, but the Delts came
bouncing back behind the
shutout pitching of Scott Logan,

the South.

But what about the facilities
that these teams need to
operate on the level to which
they seem to be striving? And
what about the rest of the
student body in need of exer-
cise to break the tension which
this school so easily creates?

Granted, money is tight and
housing is in bad shape, but I
just do not see how Davidson
College can intensify their in-
tercollegiate sports and still be
fair to the student body when
all they have is an antiquated
Johnston Gym.

However, with the varsity,
J.V, and girls having practice
and games, and P.E. courses
going on, about the only time
possible to shoot some hoops is
one night a week during your
IMAC game.

The basketball court is not
the only area that is getting
congested. With raquetball,
squash, and handball becoming
more popular, more students
are asking directions for the in-

door courts, only to find that-

there are only three of them.

stayed on their courts. Now,.

best front-line pair on campus.

' The SIF’s loss enabled Moady
Emanon Z to gain sole
possession of first place in
Division III, if only for a short
while. Emanon Z looked im-
pressive in their three game
match victory over the SPE’s
earlier this week.

The other previously un-
defeated Emanon team fell
easily to a surprisingly strong
PDT ‘‘3’”’ team. The Emanon A
paper tigers’ loss enabled the
Kerwood Derbies to roll into
first place in Division II, a
position they should keep until
the season ends next week.

The Bongs, showing a
definite liking for spring sports,
remained atop Division I, and
IFT continued loosening up for
the playoffs by treating the.

with the tennis program
greatly expanded,’ they find

themselves forced to demand .

priority on courts that used to
be exclusively for students.

° What used to be one of David-
son’s strongest facilities is
rapidly shrinking.

What can be done? The only
addition that’s been made to
the gym has been extra offices.
And when you look at other
student relaxation areas, like
our tom Union, one cannot
but feel that the administration
is not going out of its way to
care for the students’ human,
needs.

A new gym might be an im-
possible hope, for the near
future, but I think it’s time for
the student body to see what’s
going on.

They must demand that thein

needs be met, and not just be
put off in favor of expansion in
student enrollment.

Winning streak extended

Netters crush two opponents
as tournament looms ahead —

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Contributing Editor

Rick Quinby smothered Carl
Wright 6-1, 6-0, in the number
one singles and the Davidson
Wildeats rolled to a 9-0
smashing of Pfieffer Tuesday
afternoon in a nonconference
tennis battle.

The Cats extended their win-
ning string to two matches,
having whipped High Point by
a score of 6-3 on Monday.

Prior to this week, the David
son squad had experienced
rugged terrain in Greenville,
S.C. as they were soundly
thrashed 9-0 by the Furman
Paladins.

Commenting on the con-
ference loss, head coach Jeff
Frank said, ‘It was really a
strange match in that neither
team played particularly good
tennis. It was one of those
games where points are lost by
a player instead of being won
by the opposition.”

He went on to say that the
team had worked on some
strategic methods which he felt
would aid them when they face
Appalachian on Thursday af-
ternoon in Boone.

“One thing which we have to
do is be patient. and wait for

the opening before we try to put .

the passing shot in,’’ explained
the former Davidson player. ‘I
think that we still have an out-
side shot in the conference
tournament. But we are cer-

Wimps of Wooton (an ap-
propriately named team) to a
loss. The Pika volleyball team
is faring better than its softball
counterpart by being only four
games back.

Now, for all you economics '

students, Dr. Nelson missed a
writ last week in Eco 102. The
writ deals with Modern
Economics.

tainly going to have to mature
and gain some more ex-
perience.”

Frank has been concerned
over the course of the season
that playing so many freshmen
and inexperienced players in
the two singles spots would be a
problem. Now he feels that _
everyone is beginning to come
into, their own, as far as this
season is concerned.

“We have been playing five
freshmen regularly and now
they are maturing,’’ Frank ad-
ded. ‘‘This is certainly a men-
tal boost as we move toward
the tournament.”

The win over Pfieffer was
certainly a big boost for the
Cats after the Furman setback,
especially with the Moun-
taineers, rated as the top team
in the conference.

“T think the win came at the
right time and I hope we can
keep up the steam as we move
into the final week of play,”
said Frank.

The other winners against
Pfeiffer included Chip Bon-
durant at the second singles as
he stopped Richard Hartley 6-2,
6-2. John Mitchell won in the
third singles, beating Gary
Peterson, 6-1, 6-0. Stuart’

Boswell had an easy time at the

fourth slot, clobbering - John
Gaye, 6-1,6-1. Brian Cooper
took the fifth singles with a 6-3,
6-1 win over Steve Brown, as
Steve Johnson topped John

Malcolm 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, at number
six to complete the sweep for
the singles.

In doubles action Greg Dunn
teamed with Mitchell to grab,
the victory at the number one
slot by a score of 7-6, 6-3 over
Hartley and Wright. Steve
Holan and Cooper combined
the victory in the next spot over
Brown and Gaye, 6-0,6-1, while
Charlie Slagle and Johnson en-
ded the slaughter with a 6-1, 6-3

.victory over Peterson and

Malcolm.

The Cats now stand at 10-7 on
the year with a match
tomorrow against VMI at
home. They will conclude the
season, except for the con-
ference tournament, with a
home match on Monday a-
gainst South Carolina and a fi-
nal conference battle at The
Citadel on Wednesday. The
Bulldogs will also host the con-
ference tourney, which will
begin on Thursday, April 24. .

Frank still maintains some
optimism for the tournament,
especially considering that it

- will be played on clay courts.

“Right now we would probap-
ly be rated as tied for third
with Richmond and William
and Mary,” Frank commen-
ted. s

“But a couple of years ago
we were the top rated team and
everyone gunned for us. I guess
the tables are turned. and it will
be up to us.””
