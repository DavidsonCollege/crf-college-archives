Feature Male Chorus

The Davidson College Fine Arts
Festival Committee will present-
the Davidson College Male Chorus
under the direction of Donald Plott
dn its annual Spring concert on
Wednesday evening, April 13, in
Chambers Auditorium, at 8:15.
This concert by the Male Chorus
will mark ‘the second attraction of
the Eighth Fine Arts Festival on
the Davidson campus. The Fine
Arts Festival begins on April 11
and runs through April 30.

Composed of 37 selected voices,
this group has just returned from
its 21st annual Spring tour which
took the organization to four ma-
jor cities.in Texas. A tight sched-
ule kept the chorus on the move
through eight southern and south-
western states covering some 3000
miles during the 13-day period.

Highlighting the program will be
Jacob Handl’s “O Magnum Myste-
rium” for double male chorus,
“Coenam Cum Discipulis” by Gum-
pelzhaimer, a group of Russian
liturgical numbers including the
thrilling “Hospodi Pomilui,” Ran-
dall Thompson's “The Last Words
of David,” a group of German
numbers by Brahms, Mozart and
Schumann, spirituals and folk
songs, and selections by Ralph
Vaughan-Williams, Alec Rowley,
Fenno Heath, and wéll-loved num-
bers by Sigmund Romberg and

Frank Loesser. Philip Gehring, col-
lege organist, is the accompanist.

Following the Atlanta appear-
ance by the chorus recently, Has-
kell Boyter made the following
critique: “Mr. Donald Plott, the
director of this fine group, is a
sensitive musician and has the
ability to impart this rare quality
to his singers. In every selection
there was evidence of good taste,
esthetic understanding and the in-
telligent respect for the interpreta-
tion of words and music. I enjoy
hearing music that has something
to say.”

Now rated as one of the finest
choral groups in the southeast, the
Davidson College Male Chorus was
formed more than a half-century
ago by student directors. It has
grown in size and quality, and of-
fers the finest music in the choral
literature. Donald Plott, the direc-
tor, also serves as Director of the
Davidson College Department of
Music., Former directors of the or-
ganization are Earl Berg of the
Queens College faculty and Thane
MacDonald of Wake Forest Col-
lege faculty.

The Davidson Chorus will appear
with the Charlotte Symphony
Orchestra in concert on April 25
and 26 under the direction of
James Christian Pfohl.

Writer Gives More Data
On Pianist Johannesen

By D. H. OGDEN

Grant Johannesen, the young
American piano virtuoso who has
risen to rank among the finest
pianists in the world since his 1944
New York debut, will be heard in
a concert here Friday, April 15, at
8:15 p.m., in conjunction with the
Artist Series.

Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, of

Norwegian parents, Johannesen has |.

been engaged and re-engaged by
outstanding orchestras all over the
globe, from the Paris Conserva-
toire and Lamoreux orchestras, to
the New York Philharmonic and
the Boston Symphony. His fare-
well concert in Buenos Aires clos-
ing his first tour of South America
was marked by an audience recep-
tion of fifteen curtain calls.

Not only have audiences in the
United States, Canada, Europe, and
South America applauded his con-
cert appearances, but he has won
many admirers through his radio
performances” on the “Telephone
Hour,” the “Piano Playhouse,” and
the “Standard Hour,” and through
his recordings* for Vox and Con-
cert Hall. In 1952 he recorded five
concerti for Concert Hall Record-
ings in Amsterdam and among his
albums are the complete Polo-
naises of Chopin.

After winning the first prize of
the International Piano Competi-
tion in Belgium in 1949, the young
pianist has been heard often in
the great concert halls of Europe.
He has just returned from a series
of performances in’ Vienna,
Munich, Hamburg, Copenhagen,
and Oslo. A critic in Vienna called
Johannesen “a dazzling technician,
« thinking musician, and a poet

. a strongly sensitive poet.”

We had the privilege of hearing
Mr. Johannesen perform the Bee-
thoven Fourth Piane Concerto and
the well-known Grieg Piano Con-
certo this past summer with the
Brevard Festival Orchestra. His
style is a dramatic, near-flamboy-
ant one. But the quality which we
heard that sets him apart from
many other outstanding piano
artists is a certain warmth and
life which he finds in the music
that he plays and this he conveys
to his listeners. When asked which
composition or which composer he
prefers, be replies, ‘The piece 1

va

am playing at the time.” He suf-
fers and rejoices with the com-
poser of the work which he plays
and in his ability to transmit these
feelings to his audience lies a
greatness found only in the giants
of the world of music which sur-
passes perfection of note reproduc. ,
tion.

Grant Johannesen will play the
Bach “Toccata in F Sharp Minor,”
“Sonata in A Minor” by Mozart,
Franck’s “Prelude, Chorale and
Fugue.” Humoreske,” Op. 20, by
Schumann, and works by Faure
and Debussy.

Tickets may be obtained from
the Davidson College Artist Series
and will be available at the door.
Students are admitted by the ir
id. cards.

Functions Slated By
Seven Fraternities

Seven of Davidson's social fra-
ternities have announced plans for
their spring functions.

Alpha Tau Omega will give its
annual White Tea Rose Ball at the
Hotel Barringer in Charlotte on
May 7. The Bowery Ball of Beta
Theta Pi will be held sometime in
May; however, definite plans have
not yet been made.

Kappa Alpha’s Old South Ball
and Pi Kappa Alpha’s Dream Girl

nual Blue and White Ball at Radio
Center in Charlotte. The Red Fez

Delta have not yet completed ar.
rangements for their functions.

On March 12, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon held its annual Founder’s Day
Dinner and Dance at the Selwyn
Hotel, and the Sweetheart Ball,
given each year by Sigma Chi, took
place at Radio Center in Charlotte
on March 26.

The date of the Campus Club
function is April 9, but definite
plans have not yet been made.

Eu Society Wins In
Phi-Eu Competition

In the annual Phi-Eu Competi-
tion Monday night Eumanean Lit-
erary Society emerged victorious
over Philanthropic and thereby re-
tained possession of the silver cup.

Tom Dove presided over the
joint meeting held in Eu Hall in
which several literary contests.
were presented to the group and
judged by Professors Labban and
Wilson of the college faculty.

Included in the competition for
Phi, Joe Garrison's poem, “A Hun-
dred Hunched Men,” and a short
story by Mac Williamson. For
Eumanean, Lloyd Chapin read his
poem, “A Davidson Trilogy,” and
Jason McManus presented his short
story, “Snows of Yesteryear.”

A debate on the subject “Ex-
changing a Group of Students with
Vassar” followed these events.
Charles Drummond and Dick More-
head debated for Phi; their Eu op-
ponents were Jerry Helms and
Maurice Crouse.

O.D.K. Sponsors Forum
Next Wednesday Night

Another “Facts Forum on Ath-
letic Subsidization” will be held
next Wednesday at 7 p.m., in the
College Union ballroom.

All members of the student
body are invited to participate in
this discussion. At this time the
side in favor of the present sub-
sidization policy will be presented.

Dr. Cunningham led the forum
last’ week. Omicron Delta Kappa is
sponsoring this forum as an en-
deavor to present another point of
view concerning this vital ques-
tion.

Republicans’ Club
Meets to Organize

That heretofore most clandes-
tine political group has, at last,
placed itself in the eye of even
the proletariat. No, this is not the
latest of spring crop of embryonic
campus politicos, but the Young
Republicans Club.

Possibly this boldness in facing
the public after a long absence has
been stimulated by the re-election
of Republican Representative
Charles Jonas from the Mecklen-
burg district to the national Con-
gress.

This group met Monday after-
noon under the direction of Presi-
dent Mac Williamson to discuss
ambitious plans for a campus cam-
paign to increase student interest
and support of conservative politi-
cal discussion. It was hoped that
the resuscitation of this associa-
tion might stimulate the formation

of a rival Democratic clique.

The meeting concerned itself
with plans for the forthcoming
| Chapel Hill on April 14-16, the
selection of Dr. Andy Peyton as
faculty adviser, and arrangements
for outstanding speakers from na
tlonal political life to speak on
the importance of active participa-
tion at the state convention to aid
in strengthening the state and
local associations. He emphasized
is conducive to such an organiza-
tion dedicated to the thery that
even the South may someday have
a two-party system.

In addition to the aforemen-
tioned officers, certain heretical
South Carolinians were appointed
to enlist guest speakers to bring
the Republican gospel to Davidson.
These Sons of the Old South na-
turally wish their names withheld
from publication so that they may
return to their home counties with-

out risk to their fortune, families,
future, and KKK sheets.

DC Pre-Min Students
Pian Day fo Discuss
And Exchange Beliefs

Matthew 4:18-20:

“And Jesus, walking by the
Sea of Galilee, saw two breth-
ren, Simon called Peter, and
Andrew his brother, casting a ,
net: for they were fishers.

“And he saith unto them, fol-,
low me, and I will make you
fishers of men.

“And they straightway left
their nets, and followed him.’
Matthew 28:18-19—

“And Jesus came und spake
unto them, saying, all power
is given unto me in heaven
and in earth.

“Go ye therefore and teach
all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of
the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.”

These verses from the gospel
according to Matthew have been
taken into the heart of all Chris-
tians. On the Davidson campus
there are nearly one hundred and
fifty students who have professed
a deen and sincere faith and belief
in these words and have answered
the call of Jesus Christ to the
ministry of His word and life.
These students are the pre-minis-
terial students of all the major
Protestant religions.

On May 2, these students will
have an afternoon and evening
meeting with one another exchang-
ing ideas ond beliefs. Ministers
from surrounding communities
have been invited to attend and
meet with these students. The
primary purpose of this group is
to exchange ideas and reach a bet-
ter understanding of their pro-
fessed vocation and call.

Discussion groups talks, and
questions and answer periods led
and delivered by such oustanding
men as Rev. Fred Stair of the First
Presbyterian Church, Hickory, N.C.,
Rev. Henry Moffat of Gastonia,
N.C., Rev. William Benfield of
Highland Park Presbyterian
Church, Louisville, Ky., will docket
the afternoon sessions. A banquet
will culminate the evenings’ pro-
gram. All of the day’s meetings will
center: around the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church. Meet-
ings will be conducted by the in-
vited ministers.

All members of the student body
who are interested in this meeting
or wish to know something further
about it can contact Harry Peterson
or Joe Greer.

Davidson Graduate
Resigns Editorship

The Charlotte News recently an-
nounced the resignation of its edi-
tor, Mr. C. A. “Pete” McKnight.

Mr. McKnight, graduate of Da-
vidson in the class of 1938, has
been on leave since last July 1
with the Southern Education Re-
porting Service, acting as director
for this organization.

The Southern Education Report-
ing Service, better known as
SERS, recently reelected Mr. Mc-
Knight to its directorship, which
in turn caused his resignation from
the editorship of the Charlotte
News.

The SERS was estabilshed by the
Fund for the Advancement of Edu-
cation after the Supreme Court's
decision last May concerning school
segregation. The SERS does not
take sides; it merely reports what
the South is doing in order to
overcome the problems of school
segregation.

Mr. McKnight was with the
Charlotte News for several years
as managing editor before becom-
ing editor of the paper. He kas won
top reporting and newspaper
awards in the state in years past,
and has been considered one of
Charlotte's leading young men.

class spirit. A committee headed
by Bunny Perkinson purchased
several widely-read books for him.
Sinee his illness is confining in
nature, we felt such a gift would
be appreciated. The books in-
cluded are: Churchill’s War
Memoirs, Prayers of Peter Marsh-
all, No Time for Sergeants, and
Best Cartoons of 1954.
We sincerely appreciate the in-

terest that was shown.

creative writing fields. His entry,
“The Snows of Yesteryear,” is a
Thomas Sanction-like account of
the reveries of a somewhat ‘frus-
trated, though successful, bfisiness-
man who returns to a favorite
scene of youth, a summer camp.

Vereen Bell, a senior who plans
next year to attend graduate
school and eventually to go into
teaching and writing, was winner
of the third place award. His
story, “Jamie’s Sandbox,” appeared
in last year’s final issue of Seripts
‘n Pranks. This sensitively written
story shows a young boy’s reaction
against and resentment toward his
step-father.

Mr. William C. Doub Kerr pre-
sents the Willa Cather award each
year to the writer of the paper
which he judges the best of those
submitted to him. He is sole judge
of the contest. Mr. Kerr’s award
is named in honor of Wills Cather,
who was a personal friend of his;
he possesses some of the original
manuscripts of this noted Ameri-
can authoress.

Mr. Kerr attended Davidson
from 1911-13, after which he trans-
ferred to Chapel Hill for special
undergraduate courses. While he
was'‘at the University, he installed
Sigma Upsilon, the national lit-
erary fraternity, in its Blue Pen-
ci) Chapter at Davidson. A suc-
cessful writer, lecturer, and exten-
sive traveler, Mr. Kerr is at present
a teacher of romance languages at
Glendale College in California.
Though he has not been able to
return to the Davidson campus
often since his undergraduate days,
he has faithfully supported the
