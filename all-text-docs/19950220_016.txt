William Raspberry expounds on race

February 16

You’re here speaking about
community as part of Solidarity
Week. In a place as small and
insulated as Davidson, building
community ought to be far easier
than at say, Ohio State. But we
wouldn’thave you here if we didn’t
need to do something. What can
we do?

I think everybody needs to do
something, but I think it’s correct
to say that getting something done
should be substantially easier at a
place like Davidson. The odds that
you will simply know, by sight, a
fellow student froma different part
of campus makes it tougher to be

too cold. In fact, it’s very interest- ©

ing that the college has a Solidarity
Week. It’s arecognition that this is
a process, that building a commu-
nity is a process, not a thing you do
for one second and then you’ ve got
it. You have to keep doing it. I
don’t know the specifics of what
Davidson’s about, but the idea of
setting some time aside for the
express purpose of building com-
munity is a good thing. What is
much more typical on campuses is
that you’ve got a dozen or more
groups each committed to improv-
ing its position in the general
scheme of things, often at the ex-
pense of other groups in the same
arena. So there’s a lot of giving
and taking and pushing and shov-
ing, and on many of those cam-
puses there’s hardly anybody who
even gives a thought to the impor-
tance of knitting a campus com-
munity. Soit pleases me that you’ re
doing that here. -

Ina piece you wrote from Febru-
ary 1992, you said that “commu-
nity was relatively easy when
neighbors were homogenous.” At
a place like Davidson that’s so
largely white--even with the help
of support groups like the Black
Student Coalition, and professors
like Nancy Fairley, who teaches
Ethnic Studies-- it is estimated
that twice the number of minority
students leave school for good
than do white students. Is there
something other than sheer num-
bers that can make those students
feel more comfortable?

I would love to know why
those who leave, leave. I mean, it
matters a great deal whether they
leave for academic reasons, or they
think the place is too sleepy, or that
they feel too isolated. It’s an inter-
esting thing that happens: some-

' times a college that’s a distance

from a big city, and it's isolated,
like in the mountains, or wherever,
is for some kids a great place to go
and “chill” for a while, to get away
from the pressures of life in the big
city or a big suburb, and they take
to it with great enthusiasm. For
other kids (and I think it tends to be
true of black kids from big cities)
there’s more pressure at school
than at home, at least a different
kind of pressure. And they may

: feel so strongly that they’re always

on, they’re always performing, that
the chance to get back home for a
long weekend or for a break is
something that they dream about. I
think two things: I think it’s impor-
tant for everybody to learn to find
comfort in unaccustomed sur-

roundings, but I also think it’s not
a bad thing that people gravitate
towards those places and those
conditions they find comfortable.
I remember once you quoted a
student from Howard University
saying that “Atleasthere, ifthere’s
aproblem, youdon’t have to worry
about it being a race issue.”
Iremember that conversation.
What she said is that you first do a
self-analysis, you check yourself--

“Am I coming on too strong? Am ~

I obnoxious?” You may at the end
of this self-analysis decide that
you’re okay and this guy’s just a
creep. But at least you go through
it. But if the person who doesn’t
like you is white, you say he’s a
racist. You don’t even get the
value of the self-analysis.
I’mcurious what you think about
Rutgers President Francis
Lawrence and the uproar over
SAT qualifications. It was three
words that really threw people:
“genetic hereditary background."
That’s right. Powerful words.

More powerful in light of Charles
Murray’s recent book [The Bell
Curve}. Probably more powerful
still because he [Lawrence] had
recently been involved in a public
forum in which he denounced the
book as racist in its tenor. It makes
you wonder how he could have
said what he said. But it’s easier to
make some guesses about that than

it is to figure out what’s an appro-
priate response to it. When] talked
about it, I dredged up (from my
memory) an old, Ann Landers col-
umn in which the reader, a woman,
said that her husband had been
caught in an act of unfaithfulness,
and had to own up to it. He had
apologized and begged his partner
not to break up the marriage. The
reader wanted Ann Landers to tell
her if, given the infidelity, she
should leave him. Ann told her, “I
can’t tell you. All I can tell you is
you mustask yourself, ‘Would you
be happier with him or without
him?’ Only you can answer that.”
And that’s how I felt about the
students and faculty at Rutgers. If
in fact the remark was the aberra-
tion, and the behavior, before and

after the remark, was as exemplary
as it.came across in the news re-
ports, then it’s hard for me to see
how anybody would be better off
without this guy.

So then did the students who
staged the sit-in during the UMass
basketball game do the right
thing? Was that the appropriate
response?

If I’d been a student there, I
probably would have joined a spon-
taneous demonstration. I doubt
that I would have applauded his
ouster. It’s interesting: a lot of the
kids [the demonstrators] are part
of a generation of students, saying
sort of matter-of-factly, that essen-
tially all whites are racists-- some-
thing that comes with the territory.
There are some that keep it in check
better than others do. I don’t be-
lieve that, but if they do believe it,
then you’re talking about substi-
tuting a guy who’s done, by their
accounts, all the right things. Just
because of three words. Then re-
place him with a guy whose only
virtue is he is smart enough to
avoid the words. But I think it’s
one of those issues where the con-
clusions are almost necessarily in-
dividual. I know wives who, one
act of infidelity isenough. ““You’ve
broken the trust. It’s over. I just
can’t deal with this.” Then there
are others who can forgive again
and again. Some will do what I

Speaking for unity.

William Raspberry has been
writing columns for the Washing-
ton Post since 1966. His views on
crime, AIDS, the Nation of Islam,
and violent rap lyrics garnered
him a Pulitzer Prize for commen-
tary, journalism's most prestigious

award, in 1994.

Raspberry's social observa-
tions have earned him a reputa-
tion as a "conservative" among

black critics, because he does not
necessarily elevate one side of an
issue in order tocriticize the other.
That style Raspberry has used in
his almost 30 years of writing has
served to steadily chip away at
the stereotype of the black com-
munity, traditionally thought of
as unanimously liberal and

Here at Davidson, on Febru-
ary 16, Raspberry spoke about |
the importance of building com-
munity as part of our tenth annual
Solidarity Week and in conjunc-
tion with the celebration of Black
History Month.

In the tradition of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., Raspberry called
for unity of all people, black and
white.

tend to do, which is to go through
the anger and the hurt, and then try
to figure out which way I’m going

to be better off. What’s my set of :

options? The entire relationship,
not thirty seconds of it, but the
whole relationship. If the whole
relationship was shaky at best, then
thirty seconds can blow it right out
of the water. If the entire relation-
ship was solid and warm and all of
those good things, then it’s hard
for me to see how a non-vicious
lapse could undo everything.
What about the whole PC move-
ment in general? Are we pro-
gressing or just learning a new
language?

I seldom see a full blawil PC
movement out there. A good deal
depends on what you’re contrast-
ing PC with. If you’re asserting
that you don’t want a campus where
people are free to say all sorts of
hateful things, I don’t know why
we bother calling it PC. If the
debate is about what a university
does with regard to hate speech,
that’s a very interesting philosophi-
cal issue. It’s an interesting de-

bate, and it’s not helped by some-
thing labelling one of the sides:
PC, or whatever. You're talking
about really, as in many of these
things, the conflict between val-
ues. Howdo you find your way out
when, these values come into con-
flict? My preference is for an at-
mosphere that says something is or
is not forbidden. But not every-
thing that is permissible ought to
happen. Some things, some might
say, without regard to the question
of whether they may or may not be
said, is a different issue. “May not
say it” is fundamentally a legal
issue that does not very much'sup-
port stability. “Should not say it”
is part of the atmospherics, is part
of the culture of the place. Just as
in families, there can be strong
disagreements without any refer-
ences to anybody’s ancestry or in-
telligence or anything else, they
canestablish aculture in the house-

hold where you can discuss any-

thing that happens with respect.
That’s my ideal university.
