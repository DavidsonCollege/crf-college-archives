Small town isolation— homogeneity —cliquishness —
academic pressure—the ratio. So goes the familiar
litany of student complaints about the social atmo-
sphere at Davidson. Davidson’s size and atmosphere
may have a more severe effect, however, on the social

lives of the faculty, especially the very small group of ~

young, single professors.
“Davidson is a wonderful town to be married and
raise kids in,” History Professor Peter Krentz said. “If

The social atmosphere was il rcemtal in- Mathe-
matics Professor Kay Smith’s decision to leave
Davidson for St. Olaf’s College in Minnesota at the end
of this year. Smith said both professional and personal
factors prompted her to leave. Professionally, she
prefers St. Olaf’s because it is larger, has a “nationally
known mathematics department,” and provides greater
opportunities for upper-level teaching and scholarly
work. Bisons ds she wants a change from Davidson's

Students support Anderson
 cewale

Jimmy Carter and John Anderson are the leading choices for
President among Davidson students and faculty, according to a

Davidsonian poll.

Anderson was the popular candidate among students. Thirty of
73 students responding to the poll (41%) said they supported
Anderson, compared to 22 (30%) for Carter, 7 (10%) for George
Bush, 4 (7%) for Ronald Reagan, and one each for Kennedy,
Baker, Ford,-and Brown. Six students expressed no opinion.

Almost half (12 of 25 polled) of responding faculty members said
they favored Carter. Five (20%) supported Anderson, one
supported Brown and one Kennedy. The remaining professors were
undecided.

Thirty-six ._percent of the students polled said they were
Democrats, 32% Republicans, and 32% independents.

Twenty-one (84%) of the professors were Democrats. Only one
was a Republican, and three were independents.

Since among both students and professors there were more
Anderson supporters than Republicans, the poll reflected
Anderson’s ability to attract Democratic cross-over support.

occur this week, according to Physical Plant Director Grover

Meetze.

“We're off and running,” Meetze said. Contractors L.P. Cox
Construction Company“have already begun surveying the

construction site. A temporary
gravel walk is being placed in
front of Richards and Bailey
houses to provide entry while
the construction area is fenced
in. ®
An access road for Richards
and Bailey has been formed by

, widening the path across Pat-

terson Court.

Because of the construction,
students may no longer park in
front of the freshman eating
houses. Meetze said there is
adequate parking available
around the Court to accomodate
students. ‘I don’t think it will
present any problems,” he said.

While negotiations have de-
layed the start of construction,
the building will be ready by
September 1981, according to
Meetze. “I haven’t given up on
any of the schedules,’’ he
added.

Also scheduled for comple-
tion in September 1981 are the
two new dorms to be built
behind Patterson Court across
from SAE and ATO.

Meetze said the college is now
negotiating with a prospective
contractor, Laxton Construc-
tion Company.

“I hope to start surveying
(for the dorms) within two
weeks,’’ Meetze said.

Problems in
Carnegie lead

to complaints

By MARVIN OVERBY
Staff Writer

Rats, unanswered com-
plaints, flooding, and a threat-
ened lawsuit have punctuated
life in the Basement of Carnegie
Guest House this year.
in Basement Carnegie, said that
rats have been a continuing
problem. Rats have been found
in the kitchen and bathroom,
and the traps set to catch them
have been ineffective.

Worse than the rats, accord-
ing to Smith and other resi-
dents, is the lack of proper
drainage in the basement.
Flooding has resulted twice
from stopped up toilets and
showers.

Senior Aida Doss said her
room was flooded -with two
inches of water, which destroy-
ed her carpet. The College has
not yet responded to her dam-
age claim, made winter term.

Honor Council jury, selection proposals debated

‘

By GLENN KELLUM
Assistant News Editor

Increased student awareness of Honor
Council proceedings is certainly needed,
according to Dean of Students Will Terry.

The Honor Council is a student-elected 18
member body designated to ‘‘hear and
determine originally all charges of violation
presented to it,” as articulated in the Code
of Disciplinary Procedure.

A candidate in the recent SGA election
suggested more students get involved. The
suggestion, which according to Dean Terry
is not ja new one, was that Honor Council
mem be-randomly chosen each time a
case is held. This —_— has. “some
validity ,"’ said.

On the other hand, a Council with
randomly chosen members would tend to
create an ‘‘adversary system,” making the
hearings more like a trial; Terry said.
‘‘We’re not lawyers, and the students
certainly aren’t.’’ Terry said he is “‘reluc-

tant” to see a system such as this emerge.

By maintaining a fairly static Council,
the system is necessarily more ‘‘consis-
tent,’’ Assistant Dean of Students Sue
Ross said. Terry noted that a static council,
as we now have, allows separate cases to be
treated similarly. Student X ideally gets
the same treatment as Student Y.

A randomly chosen council would ‘“‘not be
very feasible,” Honor Council chairman
Hope McArn said. Experience is valuable
to the council members, McArn said.

‘Randomly chosen members would not be

familiar with procedure and any type of
orientation would be too time consuming,
McArn added:

A randomly chosen coyncil would pro-
bably mean a greater responsibility for the
chairman, Terry said. The chairman would
be more like a “judge.” “I’m not saying
whether this would be good or bad,” Terry
said.

The ‘‘confidentiality’’ of cases is some-

times very important to those students
involved, Ross said. If the Council were to
be randomly selected each time a case was
heard, the chance that such confidentiality
might be breached would be greatly
increased. .

Although no major changes have been
made in the Council’s structure or proce-
dure, various minor improvements are
constantly being made, Terry said.

One such example is a retreat like the one
held last year. More meetings and retreats
are planned for the future, Terry said. In

‘heat of the situation,” Terry seid. These —

meetings have facilitated a “greater under-

standing” among members, Terry said, and

this has been the best improvement so far.

Terry also mentioned the minimum

sanction agreement as one improvement
(See Honor Council, page 11).
