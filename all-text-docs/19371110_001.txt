Representation of Theater
Captures Cup

With a novel representation |
of a theater adorned by signs,
announcing the Davidson-Car-
olina game as the day’s attrac-
tion, the Betas captured the
loving cup presented by the

Alumni Association for the:
best -- decorated fraternity:
house.

The Betas barely_ nosed out the.
SPE’s, who were awarded second:
place after careful consideration by
the judges. —!

Alumni returning to the Beta,
house Saturday did not have a hard!
time imagining they were entering!
a real theater. Wide red and black
streamers enclosed the whole frontd
porch, and a ticket booth in the
center added realism to the scene.
Above, a marquee made of white
letters on a black background an-
nounced to the crowd, “Double fea-
ture—'Game’ Warden in ‘Call of the
Wildcat —Crow’ Little in ‘Winged
High, Winged Low’'.” On each side
of the doorway a publicity. poster
attracted the crowd; one: announc-
ed “Cartoon and Comedy—Waldo
Wildcat and Ronnie Ram,” while
the other, emblazoned with a pic-
ture of a grandstand tackle, fairly
shouted “News  Reel—Davidson,
beats Carolina.”

The second place SPE’s, who
won the cup last year, also came,
in for a share of the, decorating |
glory. Many old grads stopped to
laugh at the grinning Wildcat mer-
cilessly putting the Carolina ram's
nose to the grindstone, as well as
at the other attractions on the oth-
er side of the yard. There, by a
ticker fairly overflowing with tape,.
a broad red fine showed on an en-
larged stock market chart the drop
in s victory stock after

Carolina’s
its steady rise from the first of the
season. Nearby miniature football
players ran plays ona gridiron and

stadium made exactly to scale. A) atso from the standpaint of those |

large football on which was written
“Homecoming” crested an arch ov-

er the walk; the sides of the arch that Mr. Lafferty typifies the tead- |

bore the words “Welcome Alumni”
in large letters.

A number of passers-by were
amused to find that the sign on
the Pika house announcing “We've
Got Carolina’s Goat” was no joke—
va rather tame-looking biily stood
tied (6 a, stake in the front yard
nonchalantly munching the grass.

Scripts ’n Pranks Makes Ap-
pearance Saturday

The Homecoming issue of Scripts
‘n Pranks, Davidson College's hu-
mor magazine, made its unexpected
appearance on the Campus Satur-
day, November 6, Homecoming
Day, when local students found the
magazine cluttering up “their post
office boxes.

Editor, Ryburn, just returned
from press convention, said on see-
ing the publication for the first
time, “It sure is a good-looking
magazine |”

Columnist Chubby King, of “King
For a Day”-fame, furnished the
magazine .with its, lead story en-
titled ‘Cave Canem.” Karl Hud-
son and Bob Ramsey also contrib-
uted short stories to this initial
issue.

Cartoons for Scripts Yn Pranks
were drawn by Fred Harbin and
Bob Miller, of the sophomore class,
and Edwin Shewmake, of the fresh-
man class. Editor Ryburn also con-
descended to scratch off a bit of
art work for his admiring public.

cluded music notes and poetry.

Students of Queens

Queens College has again is-
sued an invitation to Davidson
students to attend a party at
Queens on the evening of Thurs-
day, November 18.

Queens was hostess to several
of these affairs last year, and
they were quite popular with
the students. The invitation was
sent to the president of the stu-
dent body, Teeny Lafferty, who

tary of the Charlotte chapter.

“It is our desire to promoté a
closer relationship between

at Davidson,” said Lieutenant Jar-
vis, “since practically the only
source for securing reserve offi-
cers now is from the Rk. O. T. C.
Mr. Lafferty’s record indicates that
his work is outstanding, not only
from a scholastic standpoint, but

other activities which are a com-

Seniors Vote
About Blazer

°In a meeting. after chapel last
Monday, the senior class discussed
the selection of this year’s official
-class blazers.

Votes’ were cast to determine
what material would be most suit-
able to the majority. ‘Felt-Roy,’
a new cloth similar to corduroy
proved most popular, winning by
a slight margin over the more ¢on-
ventional plaid.

A number of varied models of
sports coats have been
in the student store recently to
enable the seniors to make their
choice. New samples in the ‘Felt-
Roy’ material will be exhibited in
the store as soon as they arrive
probably tqday or tomorrow, ac-
cording to W. W. Rader, who
heads the committee charged with
purchasing the blazers. Those who
intend to buy jackets will indicate
their preference by voting as pre-
viously.

A final vote to settle the ques-
tions of style and color will prob-
ably be called for during the first
of next week.

Some forty members of the class
have signified their intention of
buying the coats, states Rader,
The cost of the blazer is not to ex-
ceed ten dollars, he adds.
