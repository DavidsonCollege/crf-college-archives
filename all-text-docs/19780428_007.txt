Anderson added, ‘‘Of course
we will keep talking about the
need for more facilities. But this
meeting will be an informative
session. There is nothing that
the Trustees will be taking
action on.”’

The Education Committee

will deal with decisions on the
three tenure candidates, Drs.
Schuh, Carroll, and Davies, and
final approval on promotions,
new appointments, and sabbat-
icals. Vice President for Acade-
mic Affairs T.C. Price Zimmer-
mann outlined the general proc-
edure for this approval. ‘‘The
Trustees delegate responsibility
to the president to secure the
kind of faculty that is described
_iIn the by-laws.”’ :

‘Trustees retain final appro-
val of every decision,’’ Zimmer-
mann continued. “‘They meet
with the candidates themselves.
In addition there is close scruti-
ny of our (Dr. Spencer. and
Zimmermann’s) recommendati-
ons to them in the case for
tenure and other promotions
and appointments.”’

AS IN past Trustee meetings, each Trustee meeting will submit
year-end reports and discuss current issues before the entire board.

“They don’t interfere a great
deal with these promotions yet
the trustees want to assure
themselves that the faculty fits
the by-laws.’’ concluded Zim-
mermann.

The Development committee

“Obviously at each meeting
there are serious questions at
hand,’’ summarized Edward G.
Lilly, vice-chairman of the Fin-
ance and Management commit-
tee. “The utilization of the Gray
Property, the Investment Poli-
cy, the tenure question--all of
these matters are important as
related to the life and continu-
ing development of the college

Opinions
sought

By ANN B. GARNER
FOCUS Editor

Aimed at providing the Trus-
tees with direct student input,
the Student Life Committee
(SLC) of the SGA circulated a
questionnaire Wednesday deal-
ing with various campus issues.

During Senate visitations, we
were able to get a general idea of
the types of issues that con-
cerned the students,’’ gaid
Laura Michael, SLC member.

The questionnaire attends to
questions concerning student
participation in faculty evalua-
tion, the importance of a faculty
member's religious beliefs in
evaluation for tenure and in
hiring, and male/female enroll-
ment ratios. In addition, the
questionnaire seeks responses
to questions involving the col-
lege’s investment policy, self-
selection, the number of cougpe
offerings, night exams, and the
release of the athletic budget.

The committee plans to tabu-
late the results Monday night
and to submit them first to the
Trustee committee heads. All of
the Trustees will receive a copy
on Thursday, May 4.

‘We're really pushing this to
get the best response,’’ conclu-
ded Michael. ‘‘We want the
Trustees to be aware of what
the students see as important.”

Responsibilities cover broad spectrum

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer

The By-Laws of the Trustees
of Davidson College entrust
that body with ‘‘the ownership,
management, and control’’ of
the College. Indeed, they repre-
sent the College as a legal
entity. Its officers. ‘‘shall have
the powers usually held by the
president and vice president of a
corporation.” .

Assistant to the President
Gary Barties described them as
“a pretty diverse group in terms
of careers. Lawyers, bankers,
doctors, businessmen, govern-
ment officials are strongly repr-
esented, among others.”’

The 46 members are selected
by the Alumni and incumbent
Trustees, though 24, a major-
ity, are elected by the Presbyte-
ries of North Carolina and
southern Florida. Upon elec-
tion, each is asked to assent to
the Preamble of the College
Constitution and the Purpose of
the College as ‘‘an institution of
Christian learning.’’ (Article I,
section 3).

According to the document,
only active members of a Chris-
tian Church may be seated on
the committee.

Although required to meet
only twice annually, the body
has traditionally convened in
October, February, and May to
transact regular business. The
President is required to attend
as ‘‘the official medium of
communications between the
members of the faculty, stu-

wes Float’

ON Lelke Nowmaw...

dents and administrative perso-
nnel, and the Trustees.”’

The President of the Student
Government Association is also
“invited to attend all meetings
of the Trustees...with the prive-
leges of the floor but without
the privelege of voting.”’

Between meetings much of
the board’s responsibility is
carried out by the Executive
Committee, composed of the

Chairman, Vice Chairman,se-
cretary and Committee Chair-
men. Because of its smaller
membership and ability to meet
on shorter notice, this commit-
tee carries out much of the
pressing or less important work
of the Trustees.

Perhaps the most visible and
significant responsibility of the
body is the selection of the
College President. The qualific-

a

ations as delineated in the
Trustee By-Laws refer only to
his religious standing. He is to
be.‘‘a loyal and active church-
man, giving evidence by his life
of the strength of his Christian
faith and commitment."’ It
makes no mention of academic
of previous leadership criteria.

The Trustees delegate ‘‘full
power to administer the day to
day affairs of the College’ to
the President, who himself fur-
ther delegates responsibility a-
mong other officers and the
Faculty. In divesting this au-
thority, he is ‘‘authorized to
recommend*“for appointment as
officers and Faculty members
non-Christians persons who can
work with respect for the Chris-
tian tradition even if they
cannot conscientiously join it,
and who can live in harmony
with the purpose of the College
as set forth in the Davidson
College Constitution.”

Tenure is to be granted only
after Trustee approval of the
Faculty member's personal and
professional qualifications in
light of the College’s Christian
commitment.

In the area of Faculty and
student government the Trus-
tees retain the power to approve
or reject any document ‘having
to do with some element or
aspect of the College or campus
governance.’? The President
may, at his discretion, suspend
any such official student or
Faculty action for seven days
pending review by the Trustees.
