EXTRA SEMESTER FOR SICKNESS

Required Gym Class
Due For Overhaul

By BOB LATHAN and GEORGE RAMSEY
As Dr. Tom Scott brought out at the athletic ban-
quet Monday night, May 6, Davidson prides itself on its
athletic program, ranging from intercollegiate athletics
down through inter-fraternity competition to the physi-
cal education program.

It is no secret, however, that;class for one term, and then
students are dissatisfied with|join the normal program. It is
several points in the latter. We|‘the responsibility of the stu-
therefore propose an examina-jdent” to pass the test by the
tion of the present “P.T.” pro-jend of his sophomore year, or
gram, and several changes to|continue in the program until
be effected therein. he has done so.

GOOD POINTS

As it now stands, the
program has its good
points. The two year re-
quired program insures all
students of receiving at
least some directed physi-
cal activity while in col-
lege, and, in some instances,
initiates an interest in
sports in which a student -
may otherwise have never
participated.

On the other hand, there are
situations which cry out for
a change. One. of the major
complaints on the part of the
students is the required once-
a-week swimming period, which
was incorporated into the pro+
gram last year.

The primary factor in making
this activity so unpopular is
the temperature of the water in
the pool. Particularly during
the early morning periods, a
dip in the cool waters of John-
ston gym is an uncomfortable
experience.

If the athletic department .
decides to include this
activity in the schedule,
with the intent of benefit-
ting the student, it should |
provide means of warming
the pool.

Granted that swimming is pro-
fitable, it seems that to in-
dulge in it during the autumn
and spring days when outdoor
recreation is possible is a mis-
take. Let’s save the pool for
rainy days and the winter
months!

FORCED PARTICIPATION

Another on the list of griev-
ances in the P.T. program is
the forced participation in cer-
tain events. Once a student

finishes his push-ups on the|”

parallel bars, running the ob-
stacle course, and other events
in the athletic ability test, he
is classified as a wrestler, a soc-
cer player, a gymnast, or a
trampolinist, and he has no
choice. We would propose a re-
turn to the practices of years
past, with attractive presenta-
tion of the various sports and
the opportunity for the students
to choose their activities.

As stated in the college cata-
logue, students who fail to pass
the athletic achievement test
are placed.in the fundamentals

Hy Q-—the brilliant scholar
tells how to stretch your dollar
Greyhound’s the way to go—
saves you time as well as dough!

We propose that this
policy be changed so that
students should be placed
in a fundamentals class if
they fail the test at the be-
ginning of their freshman
year, and continue in this
class throughout their
freshman year until they
would be placed in the nor-
mal program.

At the beginning of the soph-
omore year. students should bé
placed in the normal program
whether they have passed the

test or not. If they have failed

the test thus far, it seems high-
ly improbable that they will
pass. This would also eliminate
required P.T. for juniors and
seniors who have not passed
the test.

We also propose that the
activities of the students in the
fundamentals class be chosen
individually so as to develop
the skills in which they proved
weakest on the test.

CUT POLICY

The new cut policy, en
forced last year because
students were teking ad-
vantage of the infirmary
sick list, is unfair to stu-
dents in that it calls for
another term of P.T. if an
excessive number of cuts
is taken, regardless of the
reasons.

A change should be made
here, so that students who are
physically incapacitated may be
excused from ‘the class periods
during which this condition pre-
vails. Otherwise the cut policy
appears satisfactory.

The proposals made here
are:

1. Conditions for swim
ming periods be improved.

2. Swimming be reserved
for “indoor” weather.

3. Students be allowed o
choice of sports after pass
ing the ability test.

4. Students remain in furry
damentals class during
freshman year until test is
passed. Required participa
tion beyond this point be
nullified on basis of failure
to pass the test.

5. Modifleation of cut
policy to excuse sick stu-
dents.
