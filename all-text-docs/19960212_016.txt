Seniors have last
splash at Southern States

By Witt BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

As the men’s and women’s
swimming and diving teams push
towards the end of their seasons
and the all-important Southern
States meet, which will be held at
Davidson this Thursday through
Saturday, Churchill Hooff and
Katharine Welling push towards
the end of their successful careers.

“As is natural any time you
have acoaching transition and you
are implementing new policies and
standards, we had some attrition
when I first arrived. But, they
(Churchill and Katharine) have
stayed the course and been great
examples of what it means to meet
achallenge,” said head coach Rich
DeSelm, who arrived when the
present seniors were sophomores.

According to Hooff, this years’
senior class was the first recruiting
class for Davidson swimming and
diving, and during their four years
the men have earned a Southern
States championship (last season),
while the women have become a
significant force, placing fourth last
season at Southern States and
shooting for at least third this sea-
son.

“We need to come together as
a team (to reach their goal of 3rd
place at Southern States),” Well-
ing said. “We have to support each
other and swim well. With a meet
like this, team is a big thing. You
can get lost if you’re not support-
ing each other.”

Hooff added to Welling’s
comments, talking about the
unpredictability of meet’s like
Southern States, which will have

over 300 participants.

“You can always count on
somebody who’s supposed to do
well flopping and somebody to
come out of the woodwork and
surprise people. You really have to
hope the woodwork is on your
team and the flop isn’t. The relays
will be important. They’re worth
twice as much as individual
events,” he said.

Michael Hart, the men’s div-
ing captain expressed concern
about the meet, saying he was kind
of nervous about it because he has
been abroad for a semester and
unable to dive. But he was hopeful

that the team would be able to '

come together and perform well.

In the past, both Hooff and
Welling have performed well at
Southern States individually. Well-
ing has medalled in the 100 yard
backstroke and been a finalist in
the 100 and 200 yard backstroke,

while Hooff is a 6 time champion
four time runner-up. But accord-
ing to DeSelm, some of their most
valuable contributions have been
as team leaders.

“They have both been instru-
mental leaders, and a tremendous
help along with the other seniors in
providing leadership and support
as we put some aspects into the
program that hopefully are making
ita higher caliber and great experi-
ence for people,” DeSelm said.
“They do so much more behind the
scenes than I ever know about in
terms of solving teammate crises
and other stuff that never gets back
to me.”

Unfortunately for the team,
Freddy Schnell, a key swimmer
for the men who won three events
last season while placing second in
two, injured his ankle over the
weekend and is questionable for
Southern States.

“Who has had better success

with crowds of that size?” dsks
Sargent, who is heading up the
Davidson bid.

If the bid comes through,
Davidson will get three first round

Unsung hero
Alpert key to
Davidson’s success

By MIcuHaeL Kruse

Brandon Williams, Quinn
Harwood, and other high-scoring
Wildcats grace the highlight films.
Chris Alpert, on the other hand,
with his superior court vision and
precision passing, makes it hap-
pen.

But making it happen is noth-
ing new for the underrated point
guard. No Division I programs
scouted Alpert as a Chaminade
(NY) High senior. Determined to
play top-notch college basketball
though, he played a post-graduate
year at Northfield Mount Hermon,
a Massachusetts prep. school.
There, Brown, Yale, Boston Col-
lege, and Providence showed in-
terest, but none offered himaschol-
arship.

So Alpert contacted coach
McKillop and explained his situa-
tion. McKillop urged him to apply
and told him that, with a solid
walk-on performance, he could

receive a scholarship.

Alpert claimed the point guard
slot almost immediately, starting
25 of 28 games as a freshman. He
earned the coveted scholarship
prior to his sophomore season.

“It meant a lot,” said Alpert,
The hard work had paid off fi-
nally. I just made the most of my
opportunities. It was a very proud
moment for me and my parents.”

But he did not stop there. For
the past four years, he has played a
vital role as a member of the most
successful basketball class at
Davidson College in almost 30
years. ‘

“(Chris has) done it offen- -

sively, he’s done it defensively,
he’s accepted his role, he’s played
to the ultimate,” said McKillop.

Earlier this year, he became
the all-time Davidson assist leader,
topping the previous mark of 436.
The record consummates consis-
tent, ironman effort for Alpert, who
has started 101 of 105 games dur-
ing his Davidson career.

Floor general Chris Alpert checks on Davidson’s lead.

He averaged 6.1 points as a
rookie, 8.1 as a sophomore, and
9.7 as a junior.

_ This year, he posts 8.8 points
per game overall and 13 against

conference foes. He has compiled
145 career steals, second best in
school history.

But statisitcs only begin to
indicate what Chris Alperthas done

for Davidson basketball.

Along with classmates Bran-
don Williams, Quinn Harwood,
Jeff Anderson, and Mark McGuire,
Alpert has established the Wild-
cats as permanent contenders in
the Southern Conference, gaining
the team’s ultimate respect.

Said Harwood, “Chris is our
leader. It starts with him. It’s been
great playing with him for four
years. He’sa hell of a point guard.”

“T just try to make sure that
we’ re just together as one unit and
that we all know what we have to
do, and that’s to go out and win
ballgames,” explained Alpert, who
hopes to play professionally over-
seas next year.

But for now, the Wildcats have
set their sights on winning the
Southern Conference tournament
andthe NCAA bid that comes with
it, something they have not been
able to do in ten years.

“T just want to be remembered
as someone who was able to take
his team to a Southern Conference
championshiop and to be part of
one of the greatest teams that
Davidson has ever had, someone
who worked extremely hard and
took nothing for granted and tried
to give 100% everytime,” Alpert
said, “I think if we’re able to win
the Southern Conference this year
and get to the NCAA’s, I think all
the players on this team will be
remembered that way.”
