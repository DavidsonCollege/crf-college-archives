DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., NOVEMBER 10. 1921.

Students Hear Fine
Address on Purpose

‘Rev. Locke White Makes Strong Im-
pression on Davidson Men.

The students of Davidson had the
pleasure of hearing Rev. Locke White,
of the class of '13, give an interesting
and well worth while address last Sun-
day at the “Y” service, on the subject,
“A Young Man’s Purpose.”

Using as his text the verse, “Daniel
purposed in his heart that he would not
defile himself,” it was shown that a
college man’s difficulties and problems
are very similar to those of Daniel when
he was taken into captivity. Daniel was
leaving home for the first time and was
placed in entirely new environments.
None of the people with whom he came
in contact were Christians. But Dan-
iel, with his courage and true heart,
determined that he would not “while in
Rome do as Rome does,” and purposed
in his heart that he would not defile
himself.

Just as it took courage ted to
live up to his resolutions, so it takes
courage today to stand up for the right
in spite of adverse conditions. More-
over, because Danied did right, three
others, who lacked enough courage alone
to be the true type of men, followed the
leadership of Daniel. And today weaker
brothers will follow good examples if
the strong will but set the pace.

Charles Kingsley divides all mankind
into three classes: First, are the heroes,
those who intend to do right and do
it. Second, are “the white fools,” those
who wish to do right but lack the cour-
age to brave the criticisms of men.
Third, are “the black fools,” those who
wilfully choose to do evil. In which
class are you, the speaker asked.

Although the majority of people are
in one of the two latter classes, and
those of the first class might lose friends
by taking the stand they do, yet in the
long run they are really respected by
even their enemies, said Mr. White.

The following poem brought the ad-
dress to a fitting close:

.One ship drives east and another west
With the selfsame winds that blow;
'Tis the set of the sails and not the gales

That decides the way they go.

Just so it is on the sea of fate
As we travel along through life;
’Tis the set of the soul that decides the
goal
And not the storm or strife,

A quartet composed of Sorrels, Allison,
Crane and Buchanan added a great deal
to the musical side of the program, the
fellows singing “The Riches of Love.”

Davidson Makes Me
On 2nd Charlotte Trip

Monster Parade Staged on Arrival
in the Queen City.

With that ole “go get ’em spirit,” the
thing that makes Wildcats wild, and with
grit, enthusiasm, and the determination
to unfurl the “Red and Black” over
Wearn Field, a train load of Davidson-
ians embarked last Saturday for the
Queen City.

A parade was formed at the Southern
station in Charlotte and, marshalled by
Sam Story, the entire aggregation
marched through the main business
thoroughfares of the city. Drum Major
Wyman, in.pomp and glory, led the re-
nowned Davidson Military Band at the
head of the column, and to the strains
of ‘O Davidson,’ the presence of the
Presbyterians was proclaimed to the
most remote corners of the city.

At the Square 15 ‘rahs’ were given for
the Queen City and, after several yells
for their favored eleven, the body dis-
persed to various places of interest.

The Davidsonians, as far-as was pos-
sible, collected as a unit at Wearn Field
and throughout the game, lent their ev-
ery effort to the support of the fighting
Wildcats. At times their enthusiasm be-
came uncontrolable, and in the tenseness
of the last few moments of play, they de-
serted the stands and surged to the side-
lines for a better ‘squint’ at the move-
ments of the Wildcats.

The Presbyterians became ubiquitous
at the close of the game, and it was not
till the conductor of the ‘Wildcat spec-
ial’ shouted the final ‘all aboard’ that
they were again congregated.

' It was not a matter of particular ef-
fort, however, to spot the Davidsonians,
in the Saturday night throng that filled
the streets. On the lapel of each coat
was an indication of the wearer’s alma
mater; a little emblem that brought a
feeling of pride to student and alumnus
alike.| Pinned thereon was a combina-

tion of ribbon which distinctly branded
the wearer as a student of Davidson. It
was the Red and Black, the colors for

j which Coach Grey’s athletes had so

nobly fought, and which were flying high
over Wearn. Field.

Davidson Adds New

Feature for Readers

Semi-Comic Addition to Front Page
Begins Today.

This week’s paper inaugurates a new
feature for The Davidsonian known as
the “Wildcat Screams” which will occupy
the lower left-hand corner of the first
page, balancing the weekly calendar. It
will correspond to “Abe Martin,” “Jo Jo”
and other such semi-comic sections
which adorn the pages of many of our
daily papers.

Under the picture of a Wildcat in his
most ferocious posture, drawn by Rol-
ston Bitzer, there will appear each week
quaint and terse sayings of humor and
of timely interest. ,

J. H. McKeithen is in charge of the
new feature and will be glad to have

Armistice Day Program

Davidson College Day and Armis-
tice Day to Share Honors.

The R. O. T. C. will play a large part in
the Armistice Day celebration this year.
The battalion will have as its guest of
henor the Davidson-Cornelius Post of
the American Legion.

In addition to the many speeches that
will be made the battalion will go
through many maneuvers and each com-

the program. There will be strong com-
petition for the “flag of honor,” which
will be given to that company which, in
the opinion of the judges, performs and
executes its exercises best.

Each company will have a sponsor for
whom it is working: The sponsors will
be with their company during the pro-
gram, and the sponsor of the winning
company will carry the “flag of honor.”
Competition will be great as each com-
pany has been ttaining for these spec-
ial performances for the past three
weeks. The sponsors are: Miss Steele
tor the battalion; Miss Sophie Richards
for Company A; Captain J. M. Richards,
commanding; Miss Helen Gibbs, for
Company B, Captain T. M. Lowry, com-
manding; Miss Dorothy Finlayson, Com-

Basketball Contests Hold
Attention of All Students

Seniors and Freilimen Take Sophs
Into toiCamp,

On the night of Tue Tuesday, October 25th,
the Seniors defeated the Sophs in one
of the most hotly contested class bas-
ketball games yet seen on the local gym
court. Preceding the game it seemed as
though the very air was charged with
electricity resulting from rivalry exist-
ing between: the supporters of the two
teams. The Seniors had the edge on
their younger opponents resulting from
longer experience and continued suc-
cess while the Sophs had the confidence
resulting from not having, so far, lost a
game,

The two teams in the first half, under
the able leadership of Captains McCon-
nell and Ormond, played a “nip and tuck”
game, neither side being able’ to lead
the other by more than one point. A
goal by the Sophs was but a signal for
the Senior stars to basket one and bas-
ket one they did, just as sure as the
Sophs led the way. Asa result the score
at the end of the first period of play
was 13 to 12. The Seniors opened the
second half with a rush that completely
swamped their gamely fighting oppon-
cnts. With lightning-like passing and
adroit shooting the older brothers soon
piled up a score that made all hope of
victory for the Sophs a dim possibility.
When the timekeeper’s whistle finally
blew signalling the end of the game the

Struggle to 3-3 Tie

Wearn Field in Charlotte Scene of
Terrific Battle Saturday.

Fighting with a grim determination
that surprised even their staunchest sup-
porters, the Davidson Wildcats met,
held like the Rock of Gibralter, and
finally fought back the wolfpack from
N C. State. Although the game ended in
a 3-3 deadlock, the cat clan showed an
unquestioned superiority the
cient Canine foes.

Too much °credit cannot be given to
the Little Electric Machine. For the
Davidson eleven did a memorable thing
on Saturday. Through sheer spirit,
through indomitable determination,
through utter willingness to give the
final measure of fight that was in them,
those men of Davidson lifted from the
muck a bedraggled, bedaubed Red and
Black banner, holding it so high that it
floated and snapped proudly once more
in the light of duty well done.

It was fine. It meant more—that tie—
it stood for more than the mere tieing
of one of the strongest teams in the
state. The elements that won that vic-
tory; for in a very true sense it was a
victory, were ones of which any college
should be proud. In the matter of Sat-
urday’s game this applies to those who,
filled with a sense of foreboding, assem-
bled none the less hundreds upon hun-
dreds to cheer and sing for Davidson.

“T don’t know that we can hold State,”
sais! a prommate student a few hours be-
fore the game. “Privately I don’t think
we can, But you may count on this:
not a man of Davidson will yield today
till_he is carried from the field.”

“That was the spirit which won for
Davidson from a team better equipped
to play a finished brand of football,
against a more experienced team, against
a team that outweighed her ten pounds
to the man,

The Machine hit on all eleven cylin-
ders Saturday. Seven of those in,the
Thin Red Line stood up against the
heavier State line and exchanged blow
for blow with them. As usual Captain
La Far played a great game but the same
can be said of every man in the line.

Fresh vs. Sophs.
Last Friday, night in the gym the

Freshmen, by playing a good defensive
game, were able to hold the more ex-
perienced Soph team to 11 points while
they ran up 29. Both teams played hard,
but the Sophs could not seem to get to-
gether in their usual style and the Fresh
played an especially good game. Staley
and Morrison played best for the Fresh
five, while McConnell played the best
game for the Sophs:.
