THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 18, 1924

Largest Contingent of Davidson Students

Attend the Camp at Fort McClellan

The largest contingent of R. O. T. C.
advance students that has ever repre-
sented the Davidson unit attended the
Fourth Corp Area summer camp held at
Fort McClellan, Alliston, Ala., from June
14th to July 25th. The group of 26 men
included practically all of the student of-

ficers who will hold commands in the
local unit during this session.
Most of, the Davidson men were as-

signed to Infantry Company C, command-
ed by Captain Hearn, who for the past
severa years was head of the Davidson
College Military oer Nee Pages
Weems, the present P. M. S. & T., was
in charge of tactics for the ete camp.
Captain Ellis and Lieutenant George were
also on the staff of instructors.

The Davidson group though making a
fine record in the six weeks of training
failed to hold the cup which they won
the This summer the Uni-
versity of Florida captured the trophy.

In the athletic activities at the camp
the Red and Black showed up well. A
Wildcat baseball team was formed and
aq challenge and all. P.
C. of South Carolina responded and was
defeated 11-6, Other grames would have
been played had time permitted. As it
was Davidson was left with first claims
to the camp championship.

Harry Vance entered the heavyweight
wrestling and won out against a large
field. “Kelly” More reached the finals
in-light weight boxing but failed to win
out. In literary lines Al Lake gathered
further individual honors, taking second
place in the essay contest.

The R. O. T. C. men found the
weeks’ period of training strenuous and
intensive but intensely interesting and
instructive. The battalion will profit by
the training its

WEST VIRGINIANS

JOHN DAVIS

The first meeting of the West Virginia
Club was held at the home of Dr. H: B.

first meeting of the club this year and only

ofe member of last year’s crew was miss-

ing, Ed Buck, of Richmond. The fall elec-
tion of officers was held and the entire ticket
suggested by the nominating committee was
elected. The new officers are: Jim Pinck-
ney, president; Ronald Wilson,
dent; and Howard Arbuckle, secretary-
treasurer. After the short business session,
refreshments were served by Mrs. Arbuckle.

An important item of business transacted |

Woodrow Wilson, who shattered
his health in giving service to his country
and the world, was truly a hero and a mar-

rests in Arlington cemetery. The Disarma-

failed to accomplish what Wilson would
have accomplished had he been given the
support of his countrymen.”

The program was concluded with the sing-
ing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Ev-
eryone in uniform stood at salute and all
others at attention.

All who addressed the audience bore out
Captain Weems’ belief that the day was the
greatest peace day the country has ever
known.
