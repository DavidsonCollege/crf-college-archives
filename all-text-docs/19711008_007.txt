Unbeaten Booters
Down Western 2-1

“By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The Davidson soccer team
continued their roll to an un-
beaten season by beating the
rain and Western Carolina, and
a conference victory over The
Citadel.

The ’Cats defeated Western
2-1 here last Tuesday in spite
of a downpour that came in the
middle of the third period.

“It was an exciting game,”
assistant coach Peter Sterling
said, “‘a real big win for us.”

The first goal was scored in
the second period by Tom Tor-
nee, a freshman.

“He was the only lineman
that hadn’t scored in a_previ-
ous game,” Sterling said, “‘but
when he finally did, it was a
real impressive goal.

Tornee scored on an_ inside
kick, between the goalie and
the goal, according to Dick Le
van, team captain.

“He played the goalie excep
tionally well,’ Levan said, ‘‘and
when their goalie moved out, he
fired an extremely = difficult
kick.”

The second Davidson score
came on a free kick by full-
back Helmut Bernhardt, an ex-
change student from Malburg,
Germany.

Besides the point, Bernhardt
won a fish dinner on a bet from
head coach Harry Fogleman.

Levan also commented on the
defensive play by Bernhardt.
Western, a team with a strong
attack and a center forward
ranked tenth in the nation in
goals last year was held to
only nine shots the entire game.

Neither Levan’ nor Sterling
was quite as excited by the
team's 6-1 romp over The Cita-
del.

This was their first meeting
with a conference team.

The conference is divided into
two sections, by regions, with
the Virginia members of the
Southern Conference in the
‘northern division’? and David-

» son, Furman, Appalachian, and

The Citadel in the ‘‘southern
division.”

At the end of the season there
is a playoff between division
winners for the conference title.

The Wildcats next conference
match will be tomorrow after-
noon at Furman.

Neither Levan nor Sterling
considered the Paladins a seri-
ous threat, although the game
will be important in conference
standings.

But both coach and captain
expressed concern over their
meeting with Duke at Durham
next Tuesday.

Duke has a strong team and
is looking for an ACC title, ac-
cording to Sterling. ‘‘Last year
they beat the ’Cats 1-0, and they
appear to have improved,” he
said.

Both teams will come into
the contest undefeated, although
the Blue Devils will have play-
ed only two games.

AN ANALYSIS
By DON PARMON
Editor-in-Chief

It was one of those rare
nights for Wildcat football, not
cnly because of the 27-0 victory,
but for the delight of actually
outmanning the opposition.

The most charitable excuse
for being in Kannapolis, play-
ing against Evans Business Col-
lege last Saturday, is that it
is a traditional foe for the Wild-
kittens. Besides that, the Evans
Condors are a fun team to
watch. Any formation that has
ever been used or even thought
about has been implemented by
Evans at one time or another.

The Wildkittens rolled up 349
yards total offense and limited
Evans to 113, including 16 yards
on 2 of 21 passes. Davidson led
in all phases of the game: more
rushing, more passing, more in-
terceptions, better punting, more

HEADS AWAY

A Wildcat booter heads the ball in the Davidson win over Western Carolina.

‘Kittens Clobber Condors

scoring. even more penalty yard-
age and more fumbles lost.

It became apparent at the out-
set that the Evans program
was not the same calibre as
the Davidson counterpart. Only
24. Condors took the field for
grass drills, and no matter how
long you waited, the rest never
did appear.

The first half of activity was
largely uneventful as Davidson
failed to move the ball, while
it was difficult to tell whether
the Evans offense was really
trying to gain yards or simply
baffle the crowd.

Evans opened with the quar-
terback taking the snap from
center while facing the left side-
line. The rationale behind this
became apparent when the Con-
dors sprang their neo-single
wing with the snap flying past
the quarterback to the tailback
eight yards deep.

Despite the eight yard head
start, Greg Kalidova, the tail-
back, still had trouble with his
passes as he missed all six in
the first half.

Davidson scored its first
touchdown when David Harper
hit split end Dave Peaco with
an 18 yard touchdown pass.
The half time score was 7-0,
with Davidson amassing 96
yards on Harper’s arm _ while
losing one yard rushing. The
Condors had 66 yards running.

Early in the second half num-
bers began to take their toll.
It became evident that the
Evans interior line was going
both ways en masse. Halfback-
cornerback Pat Jarvis was help-
ed off the field after taking a
shot to the head, only to return
to the fray with one of the two
spare jersies Evans kept on
the sidelines. One play later,
he had on the other.

By now the ‘Kittens were
moving the ball steadily, be-
hind the strong running of full-
back Steve Still and Scott Buell
and Harper’s passing. Harper
hit Linn Potts for 15 yards and
a touchdown late in the third
quarter for the second score
and from then on the. Wild-

kittens moved at will.

Meanwhile the Condor bench
began to look like a Red Cross
tent in a hurricane area. By
the beginning of the final per-
iod, eight of the 24 were more
or less permanently sidelined,
gazing distantly at the lights,
which resembled candles mount-
ed on tin cans. Every other
play in the final period found
two or three Condors on the
field, waiting for attention or
just a brief rest.

Kalidova, not a pin point pass-
er under the best of conditions,
was in big trouble. The David-

son defensive line was on him
every play in the fourth quar-
ier despite his 20-25 yard drops.
With 45 seconds to go, he snap-
ped his passing string at 18
straight incompletions with a
three yard strike to Jarvis, who
was still a bit groggy.

The sideways quarterback.
Mark Gerdus, retired from the
game after one of the Condors’
trick plays. After lining the en-
tire team, except for himself
and the center, up on the left
sideline, Gerdus unaccountably
ran a quarterback keeper. Exit
Gerdus.

Davidson Netters

Lose Key Players

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

How does a tennis coach re-
place five of the top six play-
ers from last year?

That is the question facing
Wildcat tennis
Fogleman as he tries to rebuild
his young squad.

The selection of this year’s
team is almost complete, with
nine spots already filled and
one more to be chosen next
week.

Juniors David Weaver and
Gray Smith, senior Frank Dana
and sophomores Bill Allen and
Gary Bressler return from last
season’s Southern Conference
championship squad.

Newcomers to the team are
sophomores Scoot Dimon, Jim
Dorsett and Bill DuPont, while
Rick Quinby is the lone fresh-
man netter.

Fogleman’s rebuilding job
was necessitated by the grad-
uation cf Jim Cantrell and Jeff
Chetwood, the transfers of Bob
Koury and Jeff Dumansky, and
the sojourn of Hi Lankenau to
Hollins College on the exchange
program.

Koury, who captured the num-
ber one singles crown in the

coach Harry ©

conference last year, is at Wake
Forest University while Duman-
sky, the third court champion,
is presumably at the University
of Delaware.

Fogleman termed the exodus
a “staggering loss” and ex-
pressed concern over finding
the right combinations for dou-
bles teams. Weaver and Allen
played as a doubles pair last
year, but Fogleman did not
know whether that weald be
the case this season.

“IT plan to work really hard
with the boys between now and
Thanksgiving break and try to
get the doubles teams set,” he
explained. |
‘Fogleman is hopeful that
Lankenau will return from Hol-
lins in the spring, which would
definitely help the situation.

Lamenting the fact that his
tennis budget had been cut,
Fogleman pointed out that the
trip to Florida during spring
break had been cancelled and
that the team would play only
22 matches instead of the usual
28 or 30.

It appears that Weaver and
Allen will have to use their
competitive experience to help
the untested players develop
before the spring.
