Football opens with convincing win over - Maryville

‘Wildcats, on four-game win streak, prepare for Saturday * s Centennial Game

‘By Micuaei J: KRUSE
Editor in Chief

One down, five to go.

The football team beat Maryville College
41-25 Saturday at Richardson Field, getting the
first of six wins needed to post the program’ s first
back-to-back winning seasons in 38 years.

Dating back to last year, the Wildcats have
now won four in a row. With a victory in this
coming Saturday’s
Centennial Game
against Sewanee, they
would start a season at
2-0 for the first time

since 1979.

After a first half marred by missed opportu-
nities — even though the Wildcats held a 17-10
advantage’at intermission — Davidson blew the
game open with 10 points in the first five minutes
of the second and a 17-0'overall third quarter
performance.

“At halftime, I just told them that we were
playing good football,” coach Tim Landis said.
“T said, ‘Hey, I'll take a 17-10 lead.’ They got
their chins up. They committed themselves to
(eliminating mistakes) and just came out and
made some plays in the second half.”

And safety Donnie Johnson made perhaps
the biggest of them all, intercepting a Brandon
Derrick pass on Maryville’s first offensive series
after halftime. The pick set up a five-yard

touchdown run by Lorenzo Moll with 11:26 to
go in the third quarter.

Men’s soccer wins! The youthful Wildcats, after losing
their first five games of the season, captured a victory
yesterday in Greensboro, b g Miami of Ohio 2-1 in

“That really started it for us,” fellow safety
Chad Wright said of Johnson’s interception.
“And it started a down-hill effect for them.”

Wright then forced a fumble on the ensuing
Scot kickoff return. A 36-yard field goal by
Brian Langley shortly thereafter widened the
Wildcats’ lead to 27-10.

Fullback Eric Ferguson, the freshman
phenom last year who began what promises to be
a stellar sophomore season by gaining 107 yards
rushing, capped the quarter with a 15-yard scor-
ing scamper, makingi it 34-10 with 2:10 leftinthe
period.

Speedster Roland Williams ended any came-
back hopes for Maryville, blocking T.J. Emory’s
punt with 7:46 to go and taking the loose ball into

the end zone. The touchdown gave the Wildcats

a commanding 41-17 lead.

“He told me he was going to come out today
and block one,” Landis said, “and he did. He’s
just a tremendous athlete. That was a big-time
play right there.”

Despite outgaining the Scots 261-139 in the
first 30 minutes, the Wildcats led by only a
touchdown at half. :

Quarterback Tommy Dugan found a wide-
open Williams on a 43-yard touchdown toss,
opening up the scoring and giving the Wildcats
a 7-0 lead at the 3:29 mark of the first quarter.

Langley, who was perfect in his debut as a
starter, converting all five extra point attempts
and both field goal tries, added a 32-yard three-
