The posts and strings in the woods
behind Chambers are hopeful signs.

“Dave” Hudson seems bent on put-
ting a little life in the Fu Society.

Somehow the Juniors were proud that
they held the Sophs, and the Sophs re-
joice that the Juniors didn’t win,

Full many a star play is made to go

unseen, and waste its energy on the foot-
ball Tine.

WHY NOT?

College, especially one of Davidson's
type, is, out of class rooms, an almost
perfect example of a republic. The stu-
dents, citizens of this commonwealth,
govern themselves, make their own laws,
and elect their own officers. There is
every essential of a well-organized.
democratic government in college, and
rightly so. College men, who will he
the leaders in the national government
in the future, should receive training in
this line. And it is essential that this
government be as. perfect as possible.

There is one weakness in the one as
it stands at Davidson; that is, it has no
nominating system. In all important
Federal and State clections, the candi-
dates for office are elected. Every large
organization here, except the student
hody and classes as a whole, has some
theans by which its officers are nomi-
nated. Some nominating system should
be worked out for these.

Not only will this result in a more
perfect government, but it will eliminate
a great risk that is run every year, for
when men are nominated by anybody, in
fun or in earnest, on the spur of the mo-
ment, there is danger of electing unwit-
tingly an undesirable man. This is no
slap at present officers. They are, for-
tunately, the richt ones. But so long as
there is no nominating svstem. when
men are nominated after careful delib-
eration, rather than by whim, this risk
will remain.

The following are extracts from a
letter THe Davipsonian has recently
received from the American Ambulance
Field Service, and are self-explanatory.

To the Editor:

May I ask the privilege of your col-
umns to call to the attention of your
readers the pending formation by the
American Ambulance Field Service in
France of several new sections and the
opportunity which will be available dur-
ing the next few months for an addi-
tional number of volunteers who are in-
terested in France and who would like
to he of service there?

We have already more than 200 cars
driven by American volunteers, mostly
university men, grouped in sections
which are attached to divisions of the
French army. These sections have serv-
ed at the front in) Flanders. on the
Somme. on the Aisne, in Champagne.
at Verdun (five sections including 120
cars‘ at the height of the battle) in Lor-
raine and in reconquered Alsace. and
one of our veteran sections has received
the signal tribute from the French armv
staff of heine attached to the French
army of the Orient in the Balkans. We
are now on the nnint of greatly eniare-
ine our service far the last lap of the
war, and a considerable number of new
places are available.

Information as to the requirements of
and qualifications for the service will be
eladlv sent by Henry PD. Sleeper, from
the Boston Headauarters of the Field
Service. at Tce Higpinson & Co.. 40
State street. or may be obtained from
Wm. R. Hereford, at the New York
Headquarters, 14 Wall Street.

President Haynes and the faculty are
making a strenuous effort to remove the
indolént and don't care spirit prevailing
among some students. Every teacher
insists upon work being done and report-
ed on by a certain time. But, unfor-
tunately, that old spirit of Fabius, the
delayer, still survives. The habit of put-
ting off has spread thru the student body
like some contagious disease. leaving no
‘one entirely free. A composition
which should be handed in today is now
usually written tomorrow. A_ experi-

ment to be completed this week may be

finished next, and a lesson which ought
to be studied tonight is put off till morn-
ing.

The frequent practice of waiting and
delaying soon becomes a_ pernicious
habit which stifles our ambitions, dulls
our intellect, and impedes our future
orogress, We should make one united

effort toward freeing ourselves from the! #
clutches of this our recognized enemy.—| fi
