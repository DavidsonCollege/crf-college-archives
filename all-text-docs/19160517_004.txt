AWARD OF LETTERS.

*

The following have been recom-
mended by Coach Fetzer and passed
upon by the “Wearers of the D”
for base ball monograms. Before
the letters are awarded they will
have to be passed on by the Exe-
cutive Committee of the Athletic
Association. *

E. L. Alford, A. P. Saunders, L
M. Johnson, J. M. Black, A. C.
Wood, W. L. Younger, Z. V. Mc-
Millan, B. M. Brown, F. Henge-
veld, W. D. Lawson. Manager
R. G. Finley will be awarded the
monogram with a bar below it.

The following have been recom-
mended for the “D” in track. For
winning a first place in a dual meet:
G. S. Crouch, H. M. Grey, L. C.
Brand, R. Perry, W. L. Younger,
D. G. Worth. For getting five
points in a dual meet: W. G.
Morrison.

On referring to the records it
was found that the record published
in the Hand Book was incorrect
and that on Field Day last year
Van Devanter put the shot 39 feet
2 inches, so the record was not
broken this year.

Article VI, Section 2 of the Con-
stitution of the Athletic Associa-
tion: “Any person breaking or tic-
ing a track record of Davidson, at a
properly arranged ‘meet,’ or any
person winning five (5) points in
an intercollegiate ‘meet’ shall be
given the privilege of wearing the
letter ‘D' of Old English type,
crossed by an arrow, if in the opin-
ion of the ‘Wearers of the D’ and
the Executive Committee and cap-
tain of said team, such person de-
serves this privilege.”

A resolution was passed at the
last meeting of the “Wearers of the
D” to have the Executive Commit-
tee consider making several changes
in this rule. Tt was also recom-
mended that a suitable low limit be
fixed for the two mile before the
record for this event be given to any
one. The new records made by
Brand for the mile and by Grey for
the discus were verified and will be
substituted for the old records.

MOVING PICTURES GIVEN
BY THE SENIORS

Last night there was shown in Shear-
er Hall the motion picture “The Life of
Shakespeare.” ‘The picture depicts the
life of this famous writer as far as rec-
ords of the events in it are available
from various historical or traditional
sources. Considerable interest is at
tached to the picture because of the fact
that the scenes for the film were laid in
the country in which he lived and work-
ed and which is familiar to students thru
descriptions and pictures.

The presentation of the picture was
under the management of the Senior
class which is using this means to defray
the expense of the Shakespearean pag-
eant which is to be given at commence-
ment. The film was enjoyed by quite a
number of the townspeople and students.

The same picture was shown at the
Broadway Theater in Charlotte last
Monday under the auspices of the Sen-
iors, and was a splendid success. The
success of the picture was much increas-
ed by the co-operation of the members
of the Davidson Glee Club, who ren-
dered appropriate songs after each per-
formance Monday night,

THE MILITARY CAMP
AT FORT OGLETHORPE

The Military Camp at Fort Ogle-
thorpe, Ga., for students will begin on
July sth and last until August 8th. “The
total expense for students, exclusive of
uniform, is $22.50. The uniform is
quite simple and consists of such things
that the student can use afterwards on
hunting and fishing trips. Dr. J. W.
McConnell has on hand the necessary
enrollment blanks and will be glad to fill
these out for any student expecting to
attend and will make the physical ex-
amination necessary. Tt is also wise to
be vaccinated previous to going to anys

summer camp and he will be glad to do

this free of charge.

A prominent manufacturer in Char-
lotte has offered to pay the expenses of
one Davidson student to this camp and
a member of the Davidson faculty has
done likewise. It is hoped that there
will be others of the alumni and friends
who will make similar provisions for
those of the students who need the help.
The indications are that there will be
a large number of students from Dav-
idson and other colleges of the South at
this camp and it will be an excellent
outing, as well as of great value, from a
physical and mental standpoint to any
one attending.
