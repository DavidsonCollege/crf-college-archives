Perspective...

You Can
Never Go
Home
Again

By Nathan Seay

Let me introduce myself, I’m
what Dean Terry refers to as a
prodigal son. I came to Davidson
my freshman year; for a variety of
reasons I left. I goofed off for a
year and a half at an institute of
medium education, but now I’m
back for good (I hope).

Quite a bit has changed at
Davidson in these two short years.
I’m still suffering from culture
shock. I can remember the days
(or was it but a dream?) when as a
thirsty freshman, I would cram up
against hoards of minors against
the staircase in a random frater-
nity, waiting for some divine
twenty-one ycar old toascend from
the pit, eight cups of fermented
heaven precariously held in his
hands. Apparently, malt and bar-

ley have.some sort of mysterious
sterilizing power; nobody cared

where the the digits immersed in.

the glorious liquid had been.

I turned twenty-one the first
day of classed this semester, ec-
static about carrying on the tradi-
tion of helping out my fellow
(younger) man. But, valas, my
dreams were dashed against ‘the
cruel rocks of the new, improved
alcohol policy.

“New policy?” I scoffed. “Ha!
Ha! Watch me be a stealthy man
and ignore it.”

Unbeknownst tome, there was

a veritable SWAT team at this
party. These people don’t fool

around; the inflammatory red shirts
were pretty intimidating. (Thecop
with the .45 caught my attention,
as well). I didn’t seem to remem-
ber any sort of weaponry at the
parties two years ago. .

I weighed my options and de-_
cided that complicity was in my”

best interest.

Intent on my goal of becom-
ing a demigod in several minors’
eyes, I started my trek. My gener-
osity dwindled rapidly.

One beer at a time? Are you
crazy? Just look at me. I’m no
athlete. I gave it the old college try
(no pun intended), but apparently I
hadn’t spent enough time on my
Stairmaster to be able to keep it up
for very long. I never dreamt that
corrupting minors would take so
much exertion. I decided that it
just wasn’t worth it.

I found myself spending a
great deal of time in the basement
with the other twenty-one year
olds—the Haves, if you will. The
Have Nots were clamoring above,
but their pleas fell on deaf ears, and
tired legs.

This new (to me, anyway) al-
cohol policy is destroying a vital
link between the upper- and
lowerclassmen. There is nothing
like a twenty-one year old coming
up the stairs to a throng of dehy-
drated minors, saying, “This Bud’s
for you.”

Monitors: Enforce Law or Manage Risks?
Inconsistencies Make Job Difficult, Confusing

By Yvette Pita

It’s Friday night, and thereisa
party on Patterson Court. Tonight,
Braulio Lopez prepares for the
party differently than other stu-
dents on campus. Before the party
begins, he signs in with the Cam-
pus Police department, where he
also picks up a distinctive red shirt
and walkie-talkie. Lopez is an
alcohol monitor.

His role at the party is dif! fer-
ent from other people’s. Instead of
dancing to the music of a band or
D.J., he is paid six dollars an hour
toensure that the regulations of the
new alcohol policy are enforced.

Whatdoes his job encompass?
Lopez’s interpretation of his job is
to look for people who are out of
control, and keep them from caus-

ing trouble. However, other alco-
hol monitors disagree with him.
Chris Edwards believes that, as an
alcohol monitor, he should try to
stop underage drinking. In fact,
almost every alcohol monitor sces

"Some monitors will sit
on the couch and do
nothing .. . I think they
conribute to the
uncooperative
patterns of some of
the students.""

his or her job differently. They
each have their own interpretation.

The inconsistency in alcohol
monitors’ actions has posed prob-

lems for the alcohol policy, the
student body, and the alcohol moni-
tors, themselves. Some interpret
the new alcohol policy more le-
niently than others, and both ex-
tremes are hurt by this.

Strict alcohol monitors are
frustrated by lenient ones. Ac-
cording to Edwards, “Some [moni-
tors] will sit on the couch and do
nothing the whole party. I think
they contribute, in a way, to the
uncooperative pattern of some’ of
the students.” On the other hand,
lenient monitors fecl that the strict
ones make their lives more diffi-

cult. Travis Hinson quit his job as:

amonitor because of this problem.
According to him, “When one al-
cohol monitor does something out
of proportion, then people think all

Professor Offers
Thoughts on Alcohol —

Important Issue is Abuse, Not Policy

By Sally McMillen

These comments are not an
effort to reinstate Prohibition. And
they are offered knowing that the
alcohol problems at Davidson ex-
ist nationwide. Stories from
schools such as Princeton, Duke,
and Dartmouth havea familiarring.

But I am not teaching at these
institutions. What troubles me and
many of my colleagues is not alco-
hol use, but alcohol abuse. Most
Davidson students would agree that
the school has analcohol problem.
Alcohol is the focus of most social
activities, and activities where al-
cohol is not served usually attract
few students. This obsession cre-
ates two major problems. The first,
as everyone knows, is that heavy
drinking often leads to disruptive,
violent, and destructive behavior.

- At Davidson, alcohol seems to be

at the heart of bad behavior. Date
rape usually occurs when two
people have been drinking; dorm
rooms are trashed when a student
is drunk; and violence breaks out
at fraternities when men have over-
indulged. Secondly, this focus on
alcohol is a greater problem here
than at many other institutions be-
cause of our size and isolation.
With the exception of Union ac-
tivities, few acceptable alternatives
exist beyond a social life centered
around drinking.

Overindulging in alcohol cre-
ates a negative environment. I
hear about fathers who do not want
their daughters to attend Davidson;
of high school counselors who rec-
ommend that students not apply;
of students (usually female) who
transfer. The reasons are the same:
asocial life focused so exclusively
on alcohol.

Ithas been many years since I
was in college, so I have difficulty
understanding the compulsive need
for some students to drink exces-
sively before they can attend a
party. Ihave heard thatmany male

and female students feel more com-
fortable at parties if everyone is
drunk. Can one not drink in mod-
eration—or perhaps not at all—
and still enjoy oneself? Why is fun
often defined by how much one
has had to drink? And if a student
is underage and can’t get beer at a
party, why does social acceptance
derive from drinking in the pri-
vacy of a dorm room?

Students repeatedly ask that
the college treat them as adults and
allow them tomake decisions about
how they will socialize. Unfortu-
nately, some are asking for the
right to be mature in order to en-

"I would urge us to begin
a dialogue. Not on
whether or how to alter
the alcohol policy, but
[on] how to create a
better campus
environment. . .”

gage in immature behavior. Stu-
dents ask that they be able to con-
trol their own parties, a request that
often sounds as if some students
demand control in order to have
therightto be outofcontrol. Could
students socializing at Davidson
reflect. more mature behavior and
prove that they.can handle more
responsbility? The various chal-
lenges to the alcohol policy and
code of responsibility this ycar
cause one to wonder.

Davidson is a great college;
the faculty and students are stimu-
lating and lively. All of us have
taught and are teaching some won-
derful students who work hard and
constantly challenge us. Not all
students abuse alcohol. But there
is no doubt that the current social
climate has a negative impact on
classroom performance and on our
ability to treatone another decently.

Davidson could be a better place.
We all have a responsibility to this
institution, but most importantly,
to one another. We could create a
more intcresting, varied, intellec-
tual, andinclusiveclimate by shift-
ing the focus of social life away
‘fromalcohol. More students would
perform better in the classroom
and seek out the limitless possi-
bilities that can accrue from a su-
perior education.

There are productive and re-
warding ways to spend one's free
time besides Davidson parties.
Charlotte offers a variety of activi-
ties, such as the “Gallery Crawl”
last weekend. Davidson Outdoors

_ has weekend trips to climb Mount

Rogers or go white water rafting.
Students could become actively
involved in working for a new and
expanded Union. Fraternities and
eating houses could foster stronger
ties between faculty and students,
such as sponsoring a student-fac-
ulty softball game or 10K race.

I would urge us to begin a
dialogue, not on whether or how to
alter the alcohol policy, but on a
more important issue—how tocre-

. ate a better campus environment

so that excessive drinking is less
central to campus social life. Ef-
forts by student leaders and others
over.the past few years to tackle
these concerns are commendable.
But it’s going to take a greater
commitment from a broader spec-
trum of the campus to cnactchange.
It’s going to take acommitment to
lessen harmful behavior thatcomes
fromtoo much drinking. Davidson
can create a more positive social
environment. ~

Many of us on the faculty
would welcome your idcas and
comments.

- abuse of alcohol . .

alcohol monitors are the same. I
needed the work because I needed
the moncy, but I don’t think that
the new image it brought is worth
[the moncy].”

He is not the only monitor to
complain about a “new image.”
Tene Moore and Chris Torres also
say they have been viewed differ-
ently by the student body since
they became monitors. According
to Tene, “They don’t look at you
like you’re a student anymore. If1
ask people to move back from the
Stairs so that people can get down
to the basement, some respond
rudely.” Torres also belicves he
receives verbal abuse simply .be-
cause he has the red shirt on at
parties. “A guy came up to mc,
tapped me on the shoulder, pulled
outa flask, said, ‘Lookat this,’ and
drank from it. Alllasked himtodo .
was settle down, but what bothers
me is that he did it just to try to
make me mad.”

Most monitors think that the
inconsistency between themselves
is a problem. Why do they sce
their jobs so differently? One rea-
son is that they took their jobs for
different reasons. Some do it for
the money. According to Lopez,
“Some take it as a power trip and
their duty to be a hero, I take it as

"I'm highly against the

my job as a personal call

to do something good for
the college.’"

a job.” Others, like Edwards do
notcare forthe money. “I’m highly
against the abuse of alcohol. Maybe
Ican’t stop itcompletely, but I can
minimize the damages to the cam-
pus physically and helpstoppeople
from hurting other people in vari-
ous ways. I sce my job as a per-
sonal call to do something good for
the college.”

Asecond reason they sce their
jobs so differently, according to
Hinson, is that some of the moni-
tors do not have enough experi-
ence at parties. “Some of the alco-
hol monitors had never been outon
the court before they put the red
shirt on. They don’t know how to
interact with people.”

Yet another reason for the in-
consistency may be the amount of
training the monitors receive be-
fore going outtoenforce the policy.
According to Torres, “They give
you guidclincs as to what you
should do: writc people up, see that
nobody under 21 is drinking, and
watch for bottles, cans, or liquor.
That’s all the training I got.” When
Hinson read the guidelines, he
thought, “Okay, I'll remember the
basic idea, and enforce that.”
Therefore, not even the alcohol
monitors are really sure what their
job calls for. :

Some monitors perform their
job as they think it should be done.
According to Torres, “Your sup-
