OUR NEXT GAME

On next Saturday, October 28. Dav-
idson plays Roanoke College, in Roan-
oke, Va. The first game of any import-
ance played by Roanoke was with North
Carolina A. & M. In a hard fought
battle. which was featured by conserva-
tive plaving on both sides, A. & M. de-
feated Roanoke 16 to 3. This is the
only team Roanoke has played that the
Red and Black machine has met. Last
Saturday, the 21st. Roanoke played
Washington & Lee, and were defeated
33 too. The W. & L. team is not
showing up as well this season as last.
and likewise the Roanoke team appears
a little weaker. Davidson defeated
Roanoke 13 to o last season, and the
game Saturday promises to be a good
one.
