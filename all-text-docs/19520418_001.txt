Rifle Team Ends
Best Season In
Recent History

The rifle team, ponsored by the
ROTC Department, last week com-
pleted one of the most successful
seasons in its history. During the
season it won 8 out of 12 shoulder-
to-shoulder matches, and 19 out of
31 postal matches.

In addition, it finished third
among 44 competing Third
Army teams in the William
Randolph Hearst Trophy
Match, and fourth in the Third
Army Intercollegiate Match.
By placing so high in the In-
tercollegiate Match, the team
qualified for the National In-
tercollegiate Finals, results of
which are not yet known.

It is believed that, since the team
fired 115 points higher in the Na-
tional match than in the Third
Army Match, the team may well
achieve national recognition.

The team was ably coached
by Major Jones and M-Sgt.
Butts of the ROTC staff. The
team developed rapidly during
the season and won its last
eight shoulder-to-shoulder
matches. Teams defeated in
this streak were: Oak Ridge
twice, Wofford twice, NC
State twice and Clemson twice.
The following students comprised

the team: Raymond Lynch, cap-
tain, W. W. Abbott, J. L. Baker,
George Bason, R. C. Garrison, J. B.
Gordon, Alan Groseclose, B. J. Key,
D, B. McIntyre, W. L. Morris,

not given on the individual debate.
. Jnstead teams are rated in rela-
tion to thelr opponents in rodinds ‘of
three debates each. Then teams
having top ratings in these rounds
meet each other in succeeding
rounds until winners can be an-

Students Get Say
On Celebrity Pick

In conjunction with the Celebrity
Series Committee the Davidsonian
will conduct a poll among the stu-
dent body next week to determine
what type program the student
body prefers.

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, heading
the committee, expressed concern
over the fact that most series pro-
grams were largely attended by
outsiders, and to that end he is
seeking to line up a series for 1952-
53 in accordance with student re-
quest, Students will be given op-
portunity to indicate the type pro-
gtam they prefer, the subjects of
most interest to them, and the
particular artists they would like
to hear.

The man is Lt. Col. Ernest H.
Davis and he’s here to take over
the position of Professor, of Mili-
tary Science and Tactics which Col.
Ballard now holds. His predeces-
sor will exchange operations areas
with him--Korea that is.

Col. Davis is currently residing
at the Fulcher home with his wife
and cight-year-old daughéer.

Davis, whose home is in Ashland,
Kentucky, was graduated in 1940
from thé University of Kentucky
with a B.S. in chemistry, and one
leg in a cast which was broken in
a ball game.

He began his military ca-
reer with the Chemical Corps
at Edgewood Arsenal in Mary-
land. From here he went to
Camp Rooker, Alabama, where
he was stationed for 11 months
with the 84th Chemical Mortar
Batallion. .

During World War II he went
to Africa and from there to Italy
where he took part in the inva-
sion of both Anzio and Salerno on
“D” day. .

For his actions during this
two years in Italy he was pro-
moted to captain and awarded
the Purple Heart.

After serving in Italy he re-
turned to the U. S. and served for
one year with the office of the
Chief of Chemical Warfare.

Here he received the Army Com-
mendation Ribbon.

He then went to Fort Ben-

ning to the Advanced Cilasa of
Infantry School after which he
taught an advanced class in
Tactic and Staff at Edgewood
Arsenal for three years.

At the outbreak of the Korean sit-
uation he was flown to Korea where
he was made G-3 at 8th Army
Headquarters for six months.

Col. Davis then applied for
combat duty with the 5th Regi-
mental Combat team. He was
quickly promoted and saw ac-
tion as Executive Officer and
then Commanding Officer of
the 3rd Battalion of that regi-
ment.

He was awarded the Rronze
Star Medal with “V” device for
“heroic achievement” during an as-
sault on key hill positions ina bit-
ter engagement near Hajinhyon on
October 16, 1951.

While in Korea he was ‘promoted
to his present rank of Lt. Col.
Later in combat he won the Silver
Star and Combat Infantryman's
Badge.

Col. Davis takes a keen in-
terest in baseball, softball, foot-
ball and golf. He shoots in the
eighties, but said the Korean

‘links are in terrible shape.

Col. and Mrs. Davis said David-
son laid out the best carpet of any
of his stations, and he looks for-
ward to a happy tour of duty.

Wall Street Lawyer Is Now Collecting
Material To Disprove Marshall Ney Legend

The College Guest House enter-
tained a distinguished guest over
the week-end of April 12, albeit
one who promises to undermine one
of Davidson's most cherished tra-
ditions. The gentleman is Mr. Wil-
liam Henry Hoyt, a Wall Street
lawyer, who was here for the pur-
pose of gathering some final ma-
terial for his forthcoming book ex-
ploding the Peter Stuart Ney-
Marshal Ney “myth.”

Mr. Hoyt said privately that he
regretted very much being unable
to accept the local conviction with
respect to Peter Stuart Ney’s iden-
tity.

But after extensive research
in France and Scotland he has
information which forces him
to the conclusion that the two
men were not the same: He has
not yet disclosed his evidence,
and the host of Ney believers
are awaiting his findings with
interest but without fear.

Interestingly enough, it was the
same author who did so much to
undermine national acceptance of
May 20th as the date for Mecklen-
burg’s Declaration of Independence

in 1778. This book was published
in 1907 when Mr. Hoyt was a very
young man.

While on his visit to the
campus, Mr. Hoyt took tea
with Professor Chalmers G.
Davidson who is well known to
be entirely orthodox with re-
spect to Mecklenburg’s Dec-
laration.

In Dr. Davidson's copy of his
1907 book on the Mecklenburg Dec-
laration, Mr. Hoyt wrote, “If this
be treason, make the most of it.”
Professor Davidson's statement for
the press is that he has been mak-
ing the most of it for twenty years
past and expects to continue to do
so.

With respect to the Ney con-
troversy, Dr. Davidson is more
non-committal. “It will be nec-
essary to see the evidence be-
fore expressing an opinion.
But whoever Peter Stuart Ney
may have been in Europe, in
North Carolina he was the de-
signer of the sacred seal of
Davidson College. That alone
entitles him to immortality.”

offering which the director of the
library did not decline. He pre-
sented the library with a Contoura
Coutact Camera, an expensive but
relatively simple apparatus for mak-
ing photographs of rare manu-
scripts and pictures.

Such a camera is most wel-
come to Davidson College. The
library receives frequent re-
quests for material by many
Ney enthusiasts as well as per-
sons doing research in other
fields. Original material, of
course, has not been circulated
outside the building.

With the new Contoura Contact
Camera, it will be possible to sup-
ply the wants of many who other-
wise would be required to make
a special trip to Davidson.

Although Mr. Hoyt is a native
New Yorker and a Wall Street
lawyer, he does not investigate
North Carolina history as an alien

On his maternal side, he is des-
cended from the distinguished pre-
Civil War North Carolina Judge
Archibald Murphy who was him-
self a historian of note. Judge
Murphy did much to put North

Mr. Hoyt came bearing a peace | Carolina on the map.

Workers Install
Organ; Complete
Church Interior

The new Davidson College Pres-

:Tbyterian Church, costing slightly

under $800,000, is now receiving the
®Snishing touches from the building
contractors, The exter‘or of the new
church, which is to be dedicated
Sunday, June 2, during. the bacca-
lauréate sermon, is completed, but
much work still remains to be done
upon the interior of the sanctuary.

The organ, costing $35,000,
is in the process of being in-
stalled as are the pews and
other furnishings of the chapel
and sanctuary, costing $55,000.
The chapel is to be called the
Walter L. Lingle Chapel in
dedication to Dr. W. L. Lingle,
president emeritus of the col-
lege.

The contractors, Thompson and
Street, along with all members of
the faculty connected with the new
church, urge students to visit only
during working hours and to obey
any barriers placed to guard objects
in the building, for ‘yisiting per-
sonages have already caused some
unnecessary damage.

This new Davidson structure
will hold 1,042 people in its
sanctuary which hes an over-
all dimensions of 152 feet. It
has a large room which will be
used jointly as a banquet-
recreation room, not to mention
a student lounge, a ladies’
lounge, a library, offices for the
minister and the director of re-
ligious education, and Sunday
School space for all depart-
ments.

Red brick and Indiana limestone

compose the outside of this edifice,

and although it has colonial fea-
tures, it is generally reminiscent of
the Classical Revival period of
American architecture,

Firestone & FBI

To See Seniors

Mr. John Dillon stated earlier
this week that two representatives
of the Firestone Tire and Rubber
Company would be on the campus
Tuesday, April 22, to interview any
men interested in affiliating them-
selves with Firestone.

All seniors, especially business ma-
jors, who are interested should
meet for a group interview at 8:45<
Tuesday morning in room 108
Chambers. The Firestone Company
representatives are interested in
those men seeking either sales or
managerial positions.

Of an entirely different nature,
but of equal importance, will be the
interviews on Thursday the 24th,
when the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation will send men here to inter-
view certain seniors, who have pre-
viousty filled out application blanks
for entrance into the FBI. Anyone
else interested, who will graduate
in July or ‘August and will be at
least twenty-three years of age upon
graduation, is urged to attend the
group interview which will be held
at 8:45 on Thursday morning in
room 108 Chambers.
