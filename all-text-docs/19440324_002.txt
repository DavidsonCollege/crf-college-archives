Here am referring to the band, orches-

In the south these organizutions are
rated as the finest of their kind, yet on
the Davidson campus they are looked
down on as mere “fixtures,” and conse-
quently they seem to be taken for grant-
ed. .

hall teams spend long hours practicing

them to the fuilest degree when. they —

show what they can do. Yet, after the

coining over and over music until they

when they give a concert, seldom is there

passing away of the subject mentioned
perhaps more often in connection with
the name “Davidson College” than any
other— tradition. ;

Yhese are only a few of the traditions

so freshmen go unruled. Davidson had
one of the most lenient frosh systems even
in peace time: even Freshmen themselves
will agree that a little hazing is fun for
everybody, and fraternity men are unani-

University of Kentucky has a fine of

and dead limbs raked up enough so that

_To The Editor...

~ Dear [editor :
—On.the-Davidson-Gampus there is one
group of organizations which deserve

iLL the reason is that a person does
not care for it, then he is missing a great
deal in his purpose as a student ina liberal
aris college. One might say that since
there is ng conpetition, which we have
when we go to sce a football yame, there
1s not that same interest or spirit. This
is true, but must there be competition in
order for one to enjoy the fine and beauti-
ful in lite?

last weckend there was a broadcast
with the band and glee chib participating,
and those who listened to it and have any
proud to say that it was in a real sense
very close to professional. Saturday night
in Chafictte. the Symphony orchestra
gave a coneert which was heard and ap-
preciated by a good sized group of the
most tatellectual people in Charlotte,
Sunday alternoon the same concert was
given im Chambers Auditortum for the
benetit of the studem body largely. and
Yhe number tierce could be easily counted
on lwo hands. Why is this?.

into “tong hairs,” or make Bach and

raised by professors shooting the poor
birds was the uproar over misspelling the
word. Spelling, we think, is a matter of
personal inclination. U en undrstnd, this,
ent u? But this is no revolt against the
present system of Engtish. We under-
sand that a lot of the uproar was just kid-
ding. but hearing the faculty say their
mind has brought up another subject.

With the staff as small as it is, cover-
age of the news of the campus is difficult,
to say the least. We can sometimes man-
age to get routine news written up, but
every mow and then a good story breaks
which the staff has never heard of. Ex-
amples of such oversight were the Red
Cross Drive, which drove in and.out with-
Out tooting a horn, and many others. A
up-off by faculty members who knew
what was going on would have made a

Sinee the paper comes out only twice |

a month. there is plenty of time to get
notices of coming events published-— We
know that the faculty is busy €so busy
that only a few ever get to chapel serv-
ices), but it docs not take decades to ad-
dress a postcard to the Davidsonian. Like
‘the ‘college, the paper admittedly “ain't
what she used to be,” but cooperation
from the faculty as well as students would
help more than a little. Thanks, friends.
