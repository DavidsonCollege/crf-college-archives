- Faculty Members Strongly Object To Voting Restriction

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Strong opposition to the ac-
tion ef the Trustees which would
prohibit assistant professors and
instructors from voting on pol-
icy matters at faculty meetings
was indicated in a sampling of
faculty opinion taken by THE

DAVIDSONIAN this week.

The proposal seems to find
little more favor among asso-
ciate and full professors, who
would not be affected by it,
than among instructors and as-
sistant professors, who would
lose their votes if the Trustees
approve the proposal for a sec-
ond time when they meet in the
spring.

“I am quite opposed to it,”
said Dr. Paul Marrotte, asso-
ciate professor of history, who
termed the action “inappro
priate.”

ciate professor of German, re-
acted similarly, commenting
that he could not understand
why those members of the fac-
ulty who have not attained the
rank of associate or full pro-
fessor should be cut off from
voting along with the rest of
the faculty.

“If we are going to achieve
our announced goals,’ added Dr.
Louise Nelson, assistant pro-
fessor of economics, “then we
need to utilize all the brain
power we have here. Brain pow-
er is not restricted to associate
and full professors. It seems to
me a wasteful use of valuable
resources to shut off the brain
power of assistant professors
and instructors,”

A full professor, Dr. James
Reid of the geography depart.
ment, termed the action of the
Trustees ‘‘extreme.”

Several faculty members

voiced annoyance with what
they termed the “secrecy” sur-
rounding the Oct. 22 action of
the Trustees, which was not pub-
licly announced until last Fri-
day.

“I think that the disappoint-

ment in the faculty concerns the
manner in which the action was
taken,"" commented Charles
Cornwell, instructor in English.
“It seems to me that there
should have been more talk
about the whole thing. There
seems to be very little effective
communication between the fac-
ulty and Trustees.”
. Despite apparent unity in fac
ulty opposition to the proposal,
there is a wide difference of
opinion concerning whether or
not there should be a limit of
some form on faculty voting.

Cornwell said he believes
there is merit in the idea of lim
iting the vote to faculty mem

bers who have been at David
son for a certain period of time,
such as a semester or a year.
Marrotte, who said he thought
faculty members who teach at
Davidson for only short periods

of time should not be allowed to _

vote, was not sure how this
could be worked out so that ne
one who should be allowed to
vote would be prohibited from
doing so.

“A man may come here as an
assistant professor and have a
more deeply vested interest in
Davidson than a full professor

approaching retirement,’’ Mar-
rotte pointed out.
Reid, who opposes the pro

posal, also favors some sort of
limit on faculty voting.
“TI think that some restrictive
measures are necessary,’ he
commented.
“Several members of the. fac

ulty who are here for their first

year or who will be here only
one or two years have taken
the initiative in changing col-
lege policy,” he stated. “This
would have been more appro-
priate for those who have been
here longer.”

Miss Nelson, representing a
somewhat different view, favors
allowing all faculty members to
vote, as the situation now
stands.

“It seems to me,” she explain-
ed, ‘‘that the college should not
hire anyone at any rank who is
incapabie of voting intelligent-
ly.”

Pinkerton and Hansford Epes,
instructor in German, agreed
with Miss Nelson in opposing
any kind of limit on faculty vot-
ing.

“I think we need the opinion
of those who have taught else-
where in view of the rapidly
changing ideas on the place of

the liberal arts college today,"
Pinkerton explained. ‘‘There has
got to be a fair exchange with-
in the faculty.”

“People who come here fresh
from other schools have good
ideas,"’ commented Epes.

Most faculty members indi-
cated that they feel the best
way to prevent final approval
of the proposal lies in talking
with members of the Board of
Trustees in order to explain their
objections.

“An effort must be made to
talk to the Trustees about this,”
commented Epes. ‘‘This need to
sit down and talk was empha-
sized at the meeting (the in-
formal meeting of the faculty at
which the proposal was an-
nounced) last Friday.

“On any matter of such im
portance to the college there has
got to be more communication
between faculty, Trustees and

students. The success of the
vow efforts proves that this does
work,”’ Epes added.

“I am definitely opposed to
the proposed rule,”’ stated one
professor who spoke, he said,
for several full professors ‘I
would like an opportunity to dis-
cuss this with interested Trus-
tees.”

Another faculty member em-
phasized the significant effect
the proposal could have on the
immediate future of the college
if it is passed. He particularly
noted that the students play an
important role in this contro-
versy.

“I hope,’’ he concluded, “that
the students realize that this
move, if it does go through,
will tend to retard change in
several controversial areas, in
cluding those which students
have been agitating for years.”

SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION

Evaluation Group Visits

A seven-man committee of
the Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools visited the
Davidson campus this week to
evaluate the college.

According to Dr, C. J. Pieten-
pol, professor emeritus of phys-
ics, who was acting as the
“‘host’’ for the visiting commit-
tee, a skeleton schedule was
prepared and facilities provided
for them by the college.

These facilities included four
conference rooms on the second
floor of the College Union, the
faculty meeting room on the
second floor of Chambers, four
typewriters, two dictaphones
and an automobile.

The schedule for the commit-
tee included a luncheon with
Davidson President D. Grier
Martin, members of the Steer-
ing Committee of the Self-Study
Report and chairmen of the
self-study sections. Tuesday the
visiting committee met with

the Board of Trustees for lunch.

Most of the committee’s time
was spent on the follow-through
with each member's § assign-
ments. Pietenpol said that each
member of the committee had a
specific area to cover—for ex-
ample, the faculty, educational
program, and physical plant.
Each member was assigned to
at least one area, but for some
areas more than one was re-
quired.

“The way that each man
would cover his area would vary
with the individual,’’ Pieten-
pol stated. ‘‘For example, Dr.
Jack Dalton, dean of the School
of Library Science of Colum-
bia University, who covered the
library, spent such time in the
library looking around and ‘alk-
ing to the librarians.”

In the area of student inter-
views, there was contact with
the students at meals, both at
the Union and in [fraternity

houses, although student lead-
ers were not questioned indi-
vidually.

“The greatest down to earth
meeting with students was the
Monday noon meal with the fra-
ternities,"' Pietenpol stated,

Seven fraternities were hosts
for the committee members, and
“some (committee members)
spoke very highly of them,"’ he
added. “They found it diffi-
cult to leave; it was both inter-
esting and enjoyable.”

Dr. Richard T. Barber, dean
of the College of Arts and
Sciences of the University of
Louisville, had the faculty as
his assignment. ‘I think he saw
every department chairman on
an individual basis,"’ Pietenpol
said.

When THE DAVIDSONIAN
questioned President Howard
Phillips of Birmingham-Southern
College, chairman of the com-

mittee, concerning his impres-
sion and reaction to the college,
he stated, “This report is com-
pletely confidential, and reac-
tion is part of the report."

The report is confidential to
the president of the college and
to the Southern Association. An
oral report was given to Mar-
tin on Wednesday at noon be-
fore the committee left the cam-
pus, and the president makes
the decision of how it is to be
used and to whom it is to be
given.

Others serving on the com-
mittee were Dr. Robert Lage-
mann, professor of physics and
chairman o! the Planning Study
of Vanderbilt University; A. T.
Atwood, dean of students, Wash-
ington and Lee University; E.
L. Vaughan, treasurer, Univer-
sity of the South, and Dr. Arthur
E. Jensen, professor of English
and former dean of the faculty,
Dartmouth College.

‘Committee

In a 257-page volume, The Davidson Self-Study Committee released this week |’
| the findings of its two-year dissection of the College i

i The Self-Study Report is di
vided into eight areas: Educa
tional: Program; Faculty; Fi
nancial Resources, Policies, and
Procedures; the Library; Organ
ization and Administration; the

i Physical Plant; Faculty Re

search and Publication; and Stu
dent Personnel.

Each section contains a detail-
ed description of the commit-
tee’s findings, and closes with
specific recommendations for
improvements. Among the most
striking recommendations are:

—Elimination of compulsory
ROTC.

—That every student be re-
quired by the end of his sopho
more year to demonstrate com-
petence in written English com-
position, and that those who
fail be assigned to a remedial
section until competence is dem-
onstrated.

—That every student be re-
quired to pass a comprehensive
examination in his major field
before his graduation, this ex-
amination to be either in the
form of a Graduate Record Ex-
amination or, if this is not avail-
able, an exam prepared by his
major department.

—That the normal teaching
load be nine hours, and that this
be reduced. to six hours for a
professor engaged in research
or other creative work.

~—That one-half quality point
values be awarded for plus
grades, i.e., A-plus—3.5 points;
and that the number of quality
points required for graduation
be increased from 124 to: 154.

ATHLETIC GRANTS
—That the “whole matter of

tionship of this expenditure to
the receipts from the Living En
dowment.”’

—That planning begin imme-
diately for the construction of
a new library, and that a pro
gram be instituted at once which
will add 25,000 carefully select-
ed books and 125 journals a year
to the library for the next eight
years.

—That the Board of Trustees
make a reduction in its own
size, the committee favoring a
board approximately one-half
the size of the present one.

The Report also suggests that
the Board be changed in com-
position to permit members
from the General Assembly of
the Presbyterian Church in the
United States and one or two

we? %,

members-at-large from among
experts in the field of higher
education.

PHYSICAL PLANT

—That in addition to a new
library,
including an 18-hole golf course,
a gymnasium and east stadium
addition, additional lighting for
Richardson Field, a new guest
house, a new college union, a
limnological laboratory at the
Lake Campus, and a greenhouse
be constructed.

—That two clinical psycholo-
gists be added to the College
staff for student counseling and
guidance on a part-time basis.

—That there be an overhaul
in the system of student regis-
tration and faculty advising.

Fraternity Evaluation
Results Due Monday

Davidson’s 12 social fraternities will turn in their
answers Monday to the questionnaire recently prepared

and distributed to them by the Student-Faculty

Life Evaluation Committee.

In other action to be taken by
the fraternity system on the
questionnaire, the presidents of
the 12 fraternities plan soon to
begin compiling a composite
answer to the questionnaire.
This presidents’ answer will at-
tempt to reflect the attitudes of
the Greek system as a whole.

In hope of learning more about
the relationship of fraternities
to social life at Davidson, the
Social Life Committee, on this
questionnaire, has asked the fra-

athletic grants be studied, with ternities to describe their at-

particular attention to the rela-

titudes toward national affilia-

Dan Campbell announced this
week.

“The agent we were dealing

explained. ‘‘When the group who
had booked them for the other
night cancelled before we could
complete our contract, the agent
wouldn’t go through with it.”

allow the Social Council to hire
them instead,

The dance will still be held
from 10:30 p.m. tomorrow until
2:30 a.m. Sunday in Chambers
basement.

Other campus entertainment
for the fall Concert Weekend
will be provided by The Four
Preps’ concert, the Davidson-
Wofford football game and the
finals of the Southern Confer-
ence soccer tournament.

The football game will begin
at 2 p.m. tomorrow at Richard-
son Field. The concert will last
from 8 until 10 p.m. tomorrow

in Chambers auditorium.

Off-campus guests will
welcome at the concert and
dance, Campbell said. He anti-
cipated a number of Wofford
students staying over after the
game.

“This is a continuation of the
Social Council's effort to hold
small dances when students al-
ready have dates on campus,”
Campbell stated.

The Freshman Council is plan-
ning a hamburger supper fol-
lowing the football game. Tick-
ets for the supper, which is open
to all Davidson students, are
available for one dollar per
plate.

The fraternities have also been
asked what type of students they
consider most desirable for
membership in their group, what
systems of election to frater-
nities they advocate and their
attitudes toward ‘“black-ball’’
systems, selective bidding and
open bidding. Also the frater-
nities have been asked to in-
clude in their reports their opin
ions of the current rush system.

Professor Anthony Abbott, a
member of the Social Life Eval

president of Pi Kappa Phi, said,
“The purpose of the fraternity
