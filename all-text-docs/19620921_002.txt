THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, ‘SEPTEMBER 21, 1962

The Best Interests

This summer upperclass mem-
bers of the student body received a
letter. It was from a man whom most
students had come to accept as a
permanent part of the Davidson scene.

The first reaction of many was
one of anger and mistrust that no
amount of publicity releases would
ever soothe.

We remembered as freshmen.
being at first taken aback by the
booming laugh and a hearty hand-on-
the-shoulder. It seemed out of place in
the chambered atmosphere.on the Hill.
But John Horton went further until

many of us were known to him on a
first name basis.

In the letter Horton stated.
“President Martin has been convinced
that the overall interests of Davidson
College can best be served by combin-
ing the Alumni and Public Relations
office with the Development office.”

We don’t pretend to be know-
ledgeable enough to refute this. We
only know of John Horton's relation-
ship with the student body.

And with this in-mind ‘we can
only term. the incident “unfortunate,”
for both the man and his many
friends.

We can do nothirig but view with
regret the fact that a man was allow-

Hopeful Sign

“Believing in the worth of the
individual, and believing that every-
one should have an opportunity to ex-
press himself uniquely in a corporate
body dedicated to the concepts of
democratic brotherhood, mutual con-
cern and respect, and the individual
welfare and growth of each mem-
ber....” ‘

Thus begins the Constitution of
‘Lingle Manor, a “non-exclusive, demo-
cratic social organization,” an organ-
ization which promises to fill what
has been a serious need on the David-
son Campus. At last a student social
organization has appeared which has
no bidding, no pledge program, and no
national dues.

In the immediate future it will prob-
ably be primarily a social organization
for non-fraternity men and inactives,
this alone is a marked improvement,
and will offer independents some al-
ternative to YMCA hayrides and the
Union Lounge on dance week-ends.

But though Lingle Manor is now
largely patterned as a fraternity-type
social organization, it has the scope

ed to hold what both he and the col-
lege knew to be a temporary position
for four years. Granted he was only
contracted on a year to year basis and
could have left at any time. We ques-
tion the wisdom of taking four years to
determine whether or not a man is
suited for a job.

Of course the problem of finding
an alternate setup undoubtedly pro-
longed the trial period, but we think
the individual deserved the primary
consideration.

Another ramification of this
situation is that few, if any, students
knew of Horton’s temporary status.
Many only knew that he had been
here since they started college and
that. as far as they’ were concerned,
he would continue to serve in that
position. It was certainly not helped
by the dropping of ‘Acting’ from in
front of his title when both he and
the administration knew that his tem-
porary status had not changed. ©

After he was notified that the
trial period was at an end, Horton was
offered the job of assistant dean of
students. This was a position we feel
he would have more than adequately
filled. But he turned down this offer.

Any way you look at it, the situa-
tion was unfortunate.

to be far more. Fraternity men are by
no means excluded; its officers think
of it as an organization for the entire
campus. It could also branch out into
the area of community service as time
passes on.

Certainly the Administration has
been very helpful in many ways in
getting the Manor established. Mrs.
Bordeaux has been extremely active
in assisting the officers, and there has
been continued interest from Presi-
dent Martin, Dean Burts, and Business
Manager Currie. Faculty wives and
other members of the community have
expressed a willingness to help.

We are impressed by the efforts
of President Roger Durham and the
other officers and members. We are
also impressed by the Administration’s
helpful attitude and confidence.

In view of the growing number of
Freshmen who are not pledging fra-
ternities, and in view of the great po-
tential such a campus-wide organiza-
tion as this has, we think it’s a good

thing.

Education With All Due Respect

We can do nothing but welcome
President Martin's announcement that
the college will take a more stringent
attitude toward students who don't
take proper advantage of the school’s
educational opportunities.

This has been a long time coming
but now the hard facts of admission
policy have made it necessary.

Each year an increasing number
of hopefuls have been hammering at
the doors of American colleges and
universities. At Davidson more than
three times as many applications were
received than could be accepted.

With quality education at such a
premium, colleges of Davidson's cali-
er have an obligation to educate only
those who have ability and are wili-
ing to use it.

The “underachiever,” the able
student content with mediocre ades,
deserves to be goaded out of his com-

placency. We thus concur with the
“take-a-year-off” policy.

Perhaps even the professor’s sug-
gestion of scaling the number of re-
quired quality points to ability should
also be considered.

As was indicated in last year's
poll of the faculty, underachievement
is by no means a_ simple problem.
There were sharp disagreements as
to how to single out the offending
student and then just who should
work with him.

The Dean of Student’s office fre-
quently has its hands full with the
students in real trouble. The faculty
advisor system, at best, is effective on
a limited scale. This puts the burden
of the problem directly in the class
professor’s lap.

We hope the announcement
speaks for the faculty as well as the
administration.

They do this each year, intermittently yet consistently.
Henri Peyre agrees with them.

_ But I have graphic proof that such is not the
case. The Statesville Fair Association agrees with me.

The answer to this apparent contradiction lies in the
defining of fine. Davidson College apparently accepts the
first dictionary definition: ‘pure, superior in character.”
The Davidsonians apparently lean to the seventh diction-
ary definition (nevertheless just as correct): “trained or
prepared for maximum efficiency in an athletic contest.”

Bergstrand Evaluates
Socialism In Sweden

BY JAN BERGSTRAND
Richardson Scholar

Sweden is probably the most
socialized country in western
Europe. The first socialist cab-
inet ruled in the late twenties
and for almost thirty years the
socialists have not been out of
office. However, their early
years were troublesome.

During the first decade of the
twentieth century, the workers
did not have the right to vote.
Therefore they could not elect
anybody to represent them in
the Houses of Parliament. But
after several reforms that gave
everybody a right to vote the
socialists soon acquired majori-
ty in both houses. Then they
started af once to improve the
standards of living of the work-
ers.

Todey there are practically
no poor people ‘in Sweden.
Neither are there any really
wealthy people except those
who gained their millions long
ago. In the nineteenth century
the chief of the railroad com-

Russell Kirk:

pany earned 40 times as much
as a train mechanic. Now he
may earn five times as much.
Most people belong to a strong
middle class.

All kinds of medical care are
socialized. As long as they go to
school, children have even their
teeth taken care of completely
free and later on they can have
it done for a very cheap price.
There are communal hospitals
taking care of the citizens’
health. He who wants to pay for
it can have a room of his own
at the hospital; others share
rooms with several patients.

There are, however, many doc-
tors and dentists with offices of
their own. If you choose to have
one of these treat you instead,
you might get a more personal
treatment, which of course is

bound to be much more expen- .

sive. Generally these doctors
can not handle very serious ill-
nesses or emergencies.

Nobody worries about sick-
ness insurance. it is compul-
‘sory and the fee is taken from

One Glimpse

Of Conservative Mentality

BY KNOX ABERNATHY
Davidsonien Associate Editor

Some nodded their heads in
agreement; some fumed: some
chuckled; and some squirmed
restlessly in their seats as Mr.
Russell Kirk discoursed on “The
Future of Conservatism” at
Tuesday's assembly.

Mr. Kirk spent the day calling
for a return to the old norms—
those of the true conservative,
and not of the 19th Century
liberal. He, jestingly ‘perhaps,
defined his approach in the
words, “Never, without the
greatest need. disturb a thing
at rest.”

Throughout the day, whether
in the assembly, the coffee hour,
or his evening with the Conser-
vative Club, in many and varied
stories, ramblings, and opinions,
he gave those who were inter-
ested a glimpse of his conserva-
tive mentality.

Human welfare, he said,
should not be taken cere of
under the progrems of 19th
Century liberalism nor of
sentimental largesse. He
thought the program should
give its recipients “duties” —
break their “social boredom”
with work.

Kirk blasted the present tax
system, calling it repressive and
claiming that it is destroying
the small, family-owned busines-
ses of our country. He opposed
the progressive income tax and
the inheritance tax, and hinted
to the Conservative Club that he
thought the Kennedy Adminis-
tration was going to propose
next year the sort of tax reform
he has in mind.

On education, he said federal
aid and other such programs
would be unnecessary if the pub.
lic had confidence in the public
school system. If they had that
confidence, they would auto-
matically pay more taxes and
take care of the education of
the country.

He violently opposed reap-

portionment as turning over the
rule of the country to the urban
majorities—at the expense of
rural minorities. He stated in
his talk to the Conservative
Club, “America was not built
on the principle of counting
noses." and urged that we re-
turn to the constitutional prin-
ciple of weighted votes. He did
not state how the votes should
be weighed, but did go on to
call the “One Man, One Vote”
principle “illusory.”

Concerning foreign affairs,
he called for a return to the
“bed old diplomacy”, as he
termed it. He thought that
such nations as Colombia,
Venezuela, and perheps Pana-
ma are more than eager to
serve as our tools to oust
Castro in a militery invasion
of Cuba.

He attacked American foreign
policy in general, and particular-
ly accused “liberals” of trying
to Americanize everybody. He
attributed the independence
movements in Africa to a “re:
vival of witchcraft,” and called
on conservatives to come to the
rescue of our country.

“To adjust to abnormality,”
Kirk stated, “is to adjust to Sin
and Shame.” He called on Con-
servatives to maintain the old
norms, not of 19th Century lib-
eralism, but of true Conserva-
tism—whose century he failed
to name.

one’s earnings before he even
gets paid. Then, when medi-
cine is needed, one only pays
part of the real cost.

Most education is state sup-
ported. Almost all children at-
tend public schools. Nine years
of schooling is compulsory.
Those who intend to go to col-
lege go to senior high school for
another three years. This school
is highly competitive and if the
student is able to graduate from
it, he is entitled to go to col-
lege without any further exam-
inations.

At college tuition is free.
Everybody can go through col-
lege at the speed he prefers and
occasionally a bright student
may graduate in two years. The
social activities are not very
important.

The Swedesh Broadcasting
Company is chartered by the
government. However, no con-
trol is exercised except thet
commercials must not be
transmitted. Television, too, is
free from commerciels and
produced by the same com-
pany. Everyone who has a
radio or TV-set has to pay a
certain amount each year to
cover the costs.

Railroads (with a few unim-
portant. exceptions), bus lines,
and SAS, the Scandinavian Air-
lines System, are owned by the
State. However, this does not
mean that they provide free
travelling facilities. If one wants
to travel somewhere, he must
pay for it. But these companies
generally lose some money, al-
though they are not supposed to
do so.

In spite of — or maybe be.
cause of — socialism, Sweden
has the highest standard of liv-
ing in Europe today. At the
Union there is a book named
The Failure of Socialism. I
would like to talk to the author!

selections tended to grate

Red-necked peasants dared to rub

shoulders with the foreign intelligentsia. Uniformed
ushers repeatedly and rudely interrupted the per-

But such things were ignored by the eager, crowding

audience. Theirs was only

to absorb what they could,

much as a patron of sculpture yearns to grab at a mobile,
thereby to gain fuller insight into aesthetic appreciation.

Due to the retiring nature of the exhibit’s entrepre-
neur, Madam Topaz, securing an interview was next to
impossible. Of her, it can only be said that her conserva-
tive attire and her tender imprecations for solitude
belie her extreme artistic modesty.

Davidsonians went back, again and again, and ‘twas
with sadness that we bid the troupe adieu as they moved
on to other cultural centers like unto Statesville. It is
indeed a pity that such bodies of performers are not
brought directly to this campus. If it is because of lack
of dressing facilities, as certain authorities rumor, then
surely this could be corrected. Charles Dana, we appeal

to you.

False Logic Evolves
From Token Mixing

BY CHARLES DIBBLE
Davidsonian News Editor
Last week’s DAVIDSONIAN
carried a front-page feature
about our new Congolese stud-
ent, Ben Nzengu. Although 1!
have not yet had an opportunity
to meet him, I have no doubt
that Ben is a very likeable
personality and a well-qualified
student.

My interest, however, is focus-
ed on the effect that his attend.
ance here will have on student
thought. I fear that Davidson
students will now increasingly
tend to adhere to the false logic
which is all too frequently ex-
pressed, especially by non-
Southerners:

“Why, | went fo school with
Negroes. Very nice people.
Once had three in my Eng-
lish class. Never had a bit of
trouble with them. You can do
the same down here.”

This is sophistry. The ques-
tion of segregation-integration
is complex. Yet surprisingly few
admit this; they wonder why
their precise little solutions
won't work.

What is wise in a waiting
room may not be best for @
public high school. Segrega-
tion may be successful at a
counter but a failure in public
transportation. tntegration
may be fine for a private col-
lege yet be completely im-
Prudent in e public grammar
school,

The Davidson student must be
aware that geography is not the
only factor to consider in in-
tegration. The level of educa-
tion at which and the degree to
which integration takes place
are of primary importance.

This fact must not be gloss-
ed over!

Dear Sir:

The approach of my 21st birth-
day was duly celebrated last
May when I came in your office
and requested one of the secre-
taries on duty to notify the draft
board exactly where I was and
what I was doing. This would re-

quire the college to send them
form no. 109.

I was informed that it was a
good as done. “We have the
forms right here,” was the con-
fident statement that calmed my
tremblings. I even threw my
pilis away!

Imagine my surprise when
t was informed by my draft
board thet | had oe classifice-
tion of 1Al Happy Birthday!

A little checking revealed that
somehow they did not receive
no. 109. Now I don’t like to point
fingers, but is it possible you

did not send them the form?

If there is the slightest chance
(and I don’t mean that there
was) you overlooked this matter
in all the more important things
you have to do would you please
send them a form?

I would greatly appreciate
your sending it right away so
they (and 1) can rest assured
that I will be a student here
next year,

Yours in faith,
