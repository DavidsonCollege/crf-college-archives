Davidson dancing deemed decent

By WARREN SOULE

Certainly there are few who will rise
to deny that the weekend of February
9th and 10th, 1945, was an historic
occasion in the records of Davidson
College. It was on that date that the
first legal dance was held on the
Davidson College campus in all of its
109 years.

This does not mean that Davidson
students did not dance previously. It
was reported to the Session of the
Davidson College Church in 1840 that
about Christmas of 1838, one of the
students (who later became a minister
and filled pastorates in three large
Southern cities) had ‘‘taken some part
with acompany of youths in danc-
ing.” The Session held an interview
with him in which he acknowledged
the crime, and professed in a satisfac-
tory manner a feeling of regret end

repentance. He was allowed to con-
tinue as a member in regular standing
of the Church.

Not so fortunate was a young
maiden, who, it having been reported
that she ‘‘had taken part in the
exercises of a dancing party,’’ was
admonished by the pastor in relation
to that practice. The next record
which follows, two months later,
reads: ‘‘Lost one of the members of
the church by the death of Miss —
(the girl admonished) on Friday the
2nd of August.’ Which only goes to
prove the penalty for such a heingus
crime.

There was no prohibition of dancing
in the charter of the college, but the
College Church evidently curbed the
practice through the discipline of its
members. _

In the 1920’s, according .to those
sources which this reporter could find,

there was much surreptitious dancing
to Victrola’s in the fraternity halls,
though the college as yet did not
officially recognize any dances. In

1938, part of that ever liberalizing

tendency at Davidson, the faculty
ruled that ‘‘square dancing’’ was not
dancing, but a ‘‘folk game” so might
be indulged in on the campus.
Quoting from the faculty minutes of
December 6, 1938: ‘‘(Two students),
representing a non-fraternity social
group, met with the faculty to ask
consideration of a request that the
rule ‘Dancing at Davidson is forbid-
den’ be clarified so as to permit square
dances in the town of Davidson. The
following opinion of Dr. Scott Lyon
approved by the faculty shall be
incorporated in a statement to the
Trustees: ‘‘The word ‘dancing’ as
used in rule #4 of the Regulations for

To the Editor,

Cathy, why do you write such
ridiculous editorials? I realize that
things are a little slow around this
neck of the woods, but that doesn’t
mean you have to dig up fairly
inconsequential pappenings and make
them controversial.

Last year you wrote some not so
nice things about Davidson’s finest.
Now the whole student body has to
put up with the annoyance being
vented by the police force. It seems
that the cops took you as the
spokesman for the rest of the college.
Well, I guess that there is nothing to
be done about that now.

Last week you expounded on the

horrors of the Homecoming Queen
contest. You made it sound as if
young virgins were being ambushed,

dragged out in front of the crowd at
the football game, and forced to
compete for the title.

That may be the way you see it.
However, it seems to this chauvinist
that the whole affair is a pleasant
gathering of some pretty nice looking
girls; one of whom is chosen to
represent all of the other girls, as
queen. Now isn’t that just enough to
make you want to leave these shores
and move to Bulgaria (where, mind
you, such contests are specifically
banned!). I hope that no one is
permanently injured by (A) taking

Loudness lambasted

To the Editor:

This letter doesn’t deal with the
earthshaking topics usually found in
the editorial column. It’s just the
safest way for me to air.a personal
gripe. I'll be surprised if it even gets
printed. But here goes.

Last Thursday night some of the
fellows on.third Duke on the Sentelle
side facing the library decided to have
a party on their patio. Now, make no
mistake, I’m all for havimg a good
time. It’s usually a lot of fun. But
when it involves having the stereo
loud enough to understand every
word of the songs from the door to the
library and keeping it that loud until a
quarter of two AM, the saying that a
good time was had by all does-not
hold.

My friends at other schools tell me
they have a tradition that ‘‘the
weekend starts on Thursday. ‘‘We
have traditions here at Davidson, too,
one of them being ‘‘tests on Friday.”
I had one at 9 AM. Needless to say, I
needed the sleep and didn’t get it.

What could make them embrace
such an SAE-ish idea? Maybe they
think they’re special. After all, some
of them are on the basketball team,
even though they don’t play much.
Maybe they’re hard of hearing and
need the volume up loud. A more
viable solution would be for them to
get the new sign language records
(available in tapes and casettes, too).

At any rate, the next time you gee 4

some guys on the patio on third floor
Duke facing the library on the
Sentelle side, keep in mind that they
aren’t as cool as they want you to
think*they are.

Well, Cathy, I’m sure that the
Washington Post will appreciate your
talents more than deviants such as I.
In which case, it would be nice if you
saved your insights, or sent them
elsewhere (i.e. the Post,N.Y. Times,
Mooresville Sentinel, etc.)

Government of Fraternities, shall be

interpreted to mean ‘Round Dancing’

as commonly practiced in modern

social functions, and does not include

group games or folk dancing, as
defined under the general heading
‘Square Dancing’.”’ ”

Through the efforts of Dr. John R.
Cunningham, the Trustees in 1944
accepted the faculty’s recommenda-
tion that the students be permitted to
hold their dances on the campus.
Tension mounted as the momentous
weekend approached, as the leaves
were raked away from the Alumni
Gymnasium and as some waited for
brimstone and fire to descend. Every
cooperation was. rendered to the
Panhellenic Council by the Presi-
dent’s secretary, the hostess of the
college guest house, the secretary of
the music department, and’by the
college maintenance staff in the
making of decorations.

On Friday night from 9 pm until 1
am, the students, dressed informally,
danced to the music of an automatic
record machine (commonly called a
‘Suke box”); while on Saturday, they
were dressed formally and danced to
the music of John Peddicord and his
orchestra from Winston-Salem. Pres-
ident and Mrs. Cunningham were in
the receiving line both nights, as were
many other members of the faculty
and their wives.

And so it happened; traditions were
shattered and dancing came to the
campus. And so (with apologies to
CGD), also, to the tunes of ‘‘I Dream
of You’’, ‘‘Always’’, ‘‘More and.

More”’ and ‘‘Rum and Coca-Cola’’
Davidson College began to sin to
music.

Examine your motives for charity

To the Editor:

When confronted with the oppor-
tunity to contribute our time, our
talents, or our money for 'the impo-
verished or the lame, how many of us
are willing to do so not merely from
the surplus of our wealth or abilities
but according to the genuine concerns
to which we adhere?

I was thinking about this question
over the past weekend. What stimula-
ted it was the Kappa Aipha Frater-
nity’s ‘‘Muscular Dystrophy Disco’”’
with its ‘‘unlimited dancing and
BEER.’’ I am deeply indebted to
them and I admire them for their
interest in muscular dystrophy, but
does it-take dancing -and-beer to
arouse a campus interest in donating
(significantly) to a worthy cause?
This is a rich man’s compassion; he
contributes his dollars because it is an
easy way of working off his guilt for
not soiling his. clothes with the
personal needs of his society.

Davidson College has its merits as
an institution of higher education, but
it also has a perpetual problem of

fostering a ‘‘country club lifestyle’
among its faculty and students. This
is an attitude, a lifestyle students

seem to see, yet not understand or

examine. Only those who have step-
ped out of their social milieu to

examine it, or through becoming
involved in another milieu, are aware
of the atmosphere isolated from social

needs this lifestyle promotes. The
experiences such individuals have had
by stepping out of their milieus have

remolded their personalities and their
interests. If you fear such a remolding

or changing-of your lifestyle to

become intimately involved in the
needs of your society, then this letter
is particularly addressed to you. I am
willing, at your convenience,
discuss this with you personally.

The most important commodity we

to

have on this campus is not.money.. It

an

is Padi: ‘which are developed
through our investment in other
people. Obviously, this means more
than sending them some money. It
means taking the time out of our
schedules to meet with and talk to
these individuals. There are many
lonely people in this area needing our
personal involvement with them.
Some may be right here on our
campus. Some are at Huntersville in
prison or at the Boy’s Home; others, a
little older, are right here in Davidson
at the community center and the
Depot.

I know your time is limited on
campus. But, do you really believe
you will have any more time outside
of college to invest in relationships
with those who most need us? How

much will you be willing to give of
yourself?
