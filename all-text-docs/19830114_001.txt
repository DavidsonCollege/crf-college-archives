Celebrate Women

Anniversary of coeducation inspires week's events

By ELIZABETH KISS
“.. . recently I was asked if I had ac-
quired any non-Mormon habits . . . In
fact I have. I have acquired the habit of
free thought.”
'— Dr. Sonia Johnson, one year after
her excommunication from the Mormon
Church

. Women’s issues will be spotlighted
on campus next week.

Celebrate Women: Ten Years at Da-
vidson College features four days of
speeches, films, and discussion on top-
ics ranging from social justice to moth-
erhood, from women writers to equal
access admissions.

Highlighting the week’s events will
be three speakers, all women of notable
achievements. Dr. Sonia Johnson,
prominent feminist, former Mormon,
and author of From Housewife to Heret-
ic, speaks on Tuesday. Wednesday

- vidson’s

night Ruth Moose, a North Carolina
writer who has published over 200
poems and stories, gives a reading from
her work. Jennet Robinson, one of Da-
pioneer women students,
whose career has since ranged from
Afghanistan to the South Carolina
Lieutenant Governor’s office, speaks
on Monday evening.

Celebrate Women is the year’s ma-
jor project for the new Union Commit-
tee on Women’s Concerns, chaired by
senior Sherburne Laughlin. Rusk and
Warner Hall eating houses, Union
Speakers and Gallery Committees, the
Chaplains’s office, and the English De-
partment also contributed to the pro-
grams.

The week is “a concentrated effort
to arouse awareness of women’s
issues,” Laughlin said. “We’ve done a
lot of good programming earlier in the
year, but this is a chance to pull together
and hit as many interests as possible.”

“That’s what the women’s move-
ment is supposed to be — a unifying,
not a dividing, force.”

Earlier events sponsored by the
Committee have focused on women in
the ministry, contacts between students
and community women, anorexia,
abortion and teenage pregnancy, and
date rape. Committee members viewed
Judy Chicago’s art exhibit The Dinner
Party in Atlanta. Following College
President Samuel Spencer’s resignation
last month, the committee wrote a letter
to the Board of Trustees urging them to
consider women’s issues at Davidson as
they screen candidates for the position.

Response to the Committee’s work
so far has been “incredibly enthusiastic
— much more than I ever hoped for,”
Laughlin said, “People who never
would have seen themselves getting in-
volved in a women’s committee are get-
ting involved. They see their own inter-

Resignations Surprise Campus

Union Director plans retirement

By DAVID RESNIK

Director of the College Union and
Coordinator of Student Activities C.
Shaw Smith has announced his inten-
tion to retire at the end of the current
academic year.

Smith says that he planned his re-
tirement over the summer and con-
firmed it in a meeting with President Sa-
muel R. Spencer last Wednesday.

“I quit work about three years ago
and nobody noticed,” said Smith, “So it
doesn’t make much difference if I retire
now.”

Smith has held his job at the Union
for thirty years. “I’m fast catching on to
my work,” he says.

He offered no speculation about his
successor, but said that a committee ap-
pointed by President Spencer will
search for a new director during the next
few months.

“Travel, a lot of traveling” is what
Smith plans to do after he leaves David-
son.

“I feel sorry for people who’ve nev-
er seen anything but Davidson,” says
Smith, “because if you never leave, you
don’t know how great it is.”

his successor, but said that, the appoint-
ment of a new director will be “decided
under the guidance of the Vice-Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs Office.”

phomore at Davidson.
