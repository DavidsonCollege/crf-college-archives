AN EXPERIMENT

The Sophomore, Junior, and Senior
classes of Davidson are trying an experi-
ment. ‘This is the first time that it has
ever been tried here, tho it has been
made elsewhere. At some of the college:
it worked, at others it failed.

The experiment is this: “The main
purpose of college life is to turn out men
—real men, who can stand in the world
alone and do that which spells service.
Tn the past it has been generally agreed
that the first year of the college life
should be spent in teaching a Freshman
his place, in making him humble and _re-
spectful. But last year the hypothesis
~vas set forth that if a Freshman were
considered as, and treated as, a man his
first year instead of as a boy, and were
given four’ years instead of three to live
as a man, the college would turn out
better products. So the upper-classmen
pledged themselves to educate the new
anen, not with pdaddles and water bags
and compulsory singing, but with good
will and fellowship.

There are many predictions as to the
wesult. Some say that Freshmen ‘“sim-
ply can't get on without taking down,”
others say that they will become unbear-
ably “fresh,” and some think that as the
Freshmen find out that their freshness
receives no attention except disgust, they
will abandon it. But no one knows.

This much is certain, it will not be a
fair test if there are not the proper con-
ditions. If the upper-classmen go back
on their pledge, and resort to hazing as

-a punishment for freshness, the fault for
failure of the experiment will be theirs.

Provided the conditions are right, the
result lies with the Freshmen. Should
they become conceited, forget that they
are first year men, do not give upper-
classmen the deference that is due them,
and let their manner and speech become
distasteful, the experiment will have
failed, the class of ’20 will not deserve
the confidence that has been placed in
them, and great will be the disgrace
thereof. But if each Freshman plays
the part of a man, becomes not “fresher”
but more and more mature, their class
will have a record worthy of pride, and
one which future classes will do well to
follow.

The DAVIDSONIAN,

ALUMNI: SUBSCRIBE.

The editors are trying to get out a six
page instead of a four page issue this
year. They are trying to do it without
raising the subscription price and with
the same limited field for advertisements.
They are doing it to make the paper
more complete, to report in detail all the
happenings on the campus, to cover all
departments. They want to make the
issues more attractive and readable to
you and every other reader. They can-
not do it without your aid. SUB-
SCRIBE NOW. Cut out the coupon
and send it to the Circulation Manager.

Maybe the Annual has become bi-an-
nual.

Everybody likes a Freshman who
speaks when he passes.

Alas for the Seniors who hoped to
swim in the new gymnasium pool,

If David killed a giant with a sling
and stone, what can Davidson do to U
of Va. with a Red and Black Machine.
—Mullen.

Since Davidson won't, who will
Wake Forest to the fact this -vear that
they can be defeated in foothall.

Probably Woodrow Wilson had his
first experience with obstinate railroads
on the dummy dummy line.

From the size of the student body the
floods must not have flattened Father's
pocketbook as much as reports would
seem to indicate.

What a thing is this so-called College
Wit. Someone remarked the other day
that Tre Davinsonran ought to be a.
hot sheet this year since it is being issued
under the Blanket System.

FRESHMEN LECTURES.

A course that is being introduced into
the curriculum this year and which, it is
hoped, will be of great benefit to the
new students, is that Of a series of lec-
tures by faculty members or speakers
chosen by the faculty.

These lectures will be given on Friday
mornings and attendance by Freshmen
‘s compulsory. “The subjects of the lec-
tures will be those which will be of par-
ticular interest to the new men and will
help them to get settled into college life
by showing them the various relations of
the men to the college of which they are
a part.

On Friday, September 15. the first of
these lectures was given by Dr. Martin.
He made a strong appeal to the Fresh-
men to realize that they are expected to
conduct themselves in a manly way and
abide by the traditions of the campus in
regard to their attitude toward the older
students. He also emphasized the fact
that it was desired that they feel at
home on the campus and that the older
men were ready to help them in any way
nossible. Next was taken up ‘a discus-
sion of the opportunities open to the men
for efficient, conscientious work in classes
and on the campus.

POLITY CLUB HOLDS

sational Polity Club for the year was

“epresentative at the conference on In-
