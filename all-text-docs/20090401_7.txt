Security Due to Facebook Pictures

New York—John Encitas likes
to party. A brief glance at his Fa-
cebook profile makes this pretty
obvious. He can be seen drinking,
dancing or exhibiting lewd and
unsavory behavior in almost every
picture. His favorite musical artists
include Van Halen, Kiss and Kool
Moe Dee. John Encitas is also 91
years young.

“He can be seen drink-

ing, dancing or exhibit-

ing lewd and unsavory
behavior...”

Mr. Encitas’ behavior has fi-
nally caught up with him. While
school officials usually warn
students of the repercussions of
Facebook, Encitas never thought
this would apply to him. Employ-
ers can weed out job applicants
by surfing Facebook photos. Now
the U.S. government is taking the
same approach.

“J haven’t worked in 15 years,
and one day Uncle Sam pulls

Ennui, Despair
Prevail at
*Counter-Cup’

Armour Street— Each Spring,
the frattiest students Davidson
College has to offer board buses
for the Carolina Cup in Camden,
SC. The day is spent in Madras
cloth and a state of shameful in-
toxication, and usually coincides
with a horse race (it is estimated
that less than 3% of guests actually
know about the horses). However,
bad weather forecasts deterred a
many from going to the frat fest
and instead hold their own, more
sensitive féte, the Emo Cup.

Instead of seersucker and
sundresses the Emo Cup featured
skin tight jeans. “Emos” paint on
heavy eyeliner to symbolize their
devotion to the dark arts and ter-
rible music. Their hair is typically

. plastered to their head with gel so

when they dance it doesn’t get in
the way. The standard emo dance
consists of throwing one’s arms
and legs around in fits of rage, in
the hope of collisions and resultant
bodily harm.

This year’s Emo Cup was so
successful, event coordinators are

‘ considering renting the Carolina

Cup buses for next year. They
will find “authenticity” by getting
dropped off in front of the movie
theater and slouching around all
Friday evening in Birkdale. -

91-year old Encitas shows no
signs of slowing down

the plug. This is un-American! I
should be allowed to enjoy my
golden years with all the malt li-
quor and marijuana I want,” said
Encitas, who does not have glau-
coma. A spokesperson for the local
Social Security branch said they
reserve the right to review appli-
cants and, furthermore, Mr. Enci-
tas’ behavior is “deplorable.”

This case represents a great
change occuring on “the Book.”
Most younger members on Face-
book find it a bit creepy that 50+
relatives and random third cousins,
who blew their hand off at the last
Fourth of July picnic, want to be a
part of this online community.

Obama Threatens to Fine Auto Industry
Unless it Stops Losing Money

Detroit— President Barack
Obama has given many companies
in the auto industries just a few
weeks to comply with the fine
print of the government bailout
plan. GM has been given a month
and Chrysler has 60 days to follow
President Obama’s strict guide-
lines. The plans are simple: incor-
porate eco-friendly cars and stop
losing money.

“If you don’t create a
viable vehicle to trans-
port tourists to and
from the moon you will
face bankruptcy.”

“Tf you can’t make an am-
phibious tank that runs on its own
nuclear reactor affordable to even
the lower class, you don’t deserve
government aid. If you don’t make
the Transformers affordable to
all Americans, we will let you go
bankrupt. If you don’t create a vi-
able vehicle to transport tourists
to and from the moon you will

Disney’s High School Musical:
The College Years

Thanks to the success of the
High School Musical trilogy,
Disney Channel has decided to
continue the series
with a fourth
installment
entitled High
School Musical:
The College
Years.

The film,
set for release
in theaters in
August 2009,
chronicles the
characters’ expe-
riences in their
freshman year of
college.

Everyone’s favorite jock-
turned-drama-geek, Troy Bolton,
is introduced to the joys of fra-
ternity life at Cal-Berkeley. He is
quickly suspended from both the
basketball team and the drama
club for numerous drinking viola-
tions, leading him to sing the tear-
ful ballad “Boozin’ Ballers.”

Troy’s brainy girlfriend, Ga-
briella Montez, gets back her .
first-semester grades at Stanford,
discovers that she is not nearly as
smart as she thought she was and
decides to transfer to a local voca-
tional school to be a car mechanic.
She and Troy drunkenly elope

in Las Vegas over spring break
while singing a playful duet called
“Oops — Where’d My Pants Go?”

The climax

Sharpay Evans, who is notorious
for applying mascara while driv-

ing her hot-pink Mustang, smashes

the car into the main academic
building of the University of Al-
buquerque and dies, to the barely-
concealed amusement of the other
characters, who sing the catchy
“Ding-Dong! The Bitch is Dead”
at the funeral in the last scene.

The film is expected to gross
over $50 million in North Amer-
ica, trumping the earnings of the
third episode. It was rated R by
the Motion Picture Association of
America, and given an enthusias-
tic two thumbs up by Ebert and
Roeper.

face bankruptcy. Also please stop
losing money,” said Obama in a
recent press conference.

These developments have
caused quite a debate amongst
industry gi-
ants. Recently
the CFO of
Chrysler re-
signed saying
“these demands
are impossible.

Obama's person-that technology

Cadillac line
said “year after year, decade af-.

papered over and tough choices
kicked down the road, even as
foreign competitors outpaced us.
Well, we have reached the end of
that road. Now you must create an
affordable hovercraft with massag-
ing chairs and DVD players. Spin-
ning rims are also an important
part of this initiative, I would like
to see some developed especially
for pizza delivery technicians.”
The next month or so should be
very interesting for the auto in-
dustry.

‘thing remained unclear: how:
-does this affect the shy girls?
