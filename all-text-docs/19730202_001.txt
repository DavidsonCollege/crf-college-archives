Missing Library Books Cause Concern

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

The problem of missing books
is nothing particularly new.
From 1967 to 1971, an average of
250 were lost each year.
However, the inventory con-
ducted by the library staff last
June shows a record 360
volumes were lost during the
1971-72 academic year.

Chalmers Davidson,
director of the library, now
terms the problem ‘extremely
serious," and_ said _ that
measures aimed at reducing
the loss must be considered.

At the present time the only

action which has been taken is |

the publication of a list of
missing books.

Davidson said, however,
that before action is taken he
would want to present the
problem to the students. ‘‘The
only way an open shelf library
can work is if the students
really want it to work."

He added that the open stack
system has worked for a great
many years, and that he sees no
reason why students cannot
continue to make it function.

Many solutions to. the
problem have been suggested.
One possibility would involve
placing a turnstile in the en-
trance way. The turnstile would
be manned by an attendent who
would ensure that all books
leaving the library had been
checked out.

Such systems are in use at
university and city libraries
across the country, but David-
son said that he would not want
to see such a system installed

here because it would be an in-
sult to the student body.

“The open stack system sets
Davidson apart from other
schools,"’ Davidson said. He
added, however, that if the loss
of books continues at its present
rate, turnstiles may _ be
necessary.

It is doubtful that any such
measures would be taken in the
present library. The nature of

the building provides ample op-
portunities for one to beat a
closed stack or turnstile
system.

However, the new library is
designed to be readily adap-
table for such securit
measures. For instance, it will
not be possible to open the win-
dows in the new library, thus
making it virtually impossible
for anyone to drop a book to the

Vol. LXII, No. Fourteen

The

ground.

A second reason for not in-
stalling turnstiles at the present
time is a financial one. ‘It
would cost less to replace the
missing books than to put in a
turnstile and pay someone io
manage it,”’ said Davidson.

However, many books such as
bound volumes of periodicals
cannot be replaced at any
price, according to Davidson.

There is substantial evidence
that many more books are
illegally removed each year
from the library than are in-
dicated in the yearly inventory.
Apparently students remove
many of these volumes without
checking them out and return
them to the shelves before the
year is out.

Governance, Calendar Surface As Major
Issues In Hard-Fought Senate

In senatorial elections this
week, Miles Ward. Bob Cun-
ningham, and Mitch Purvis
were elected from the rising
senior class; Vince Rabil. Blain
Butner. and Rick Damewood
from the rising junior class:
and Steve Bell, John Guthrie.
and Duncan Moore trom the
rising sophomore class.

In the Senior class run-off
elections, Miles Ward was elec-
ted class president in addition
to serving on the SGA this
coming year.

Ward's major interest is
seeing the Davidson freshman
get the most out of his first year.

“The SGA. through the
Residence Hall Council (RHC).
has a tremendous amount of
ability to promote freshman
parties and activities.” Ward
commented, “and the major
emphasis in this direction
should come through freshman
senators.”

Also along the lines of social
life activities. Ward hopes to
“work with the Union from my
SGA position” and expresses a
desire to be appointed to the
Committee on the Union to
facilitate this interest.

‘IT am just ready to do some
work,’ Ward summarized.

Budget Committee Anticipates
Increase In Cost Of Tuition

By BRUCE CORSER

Staff Writer
C. David Cornell, vice
president of finance and

development, stated at the
open meeting of the Budget.
Building and Grounds Com-
mittee Monday that tuition will
increase next year “in the
neighborhood of $200 to $300."

He pointed out, though. that
the rate of increase of tuition,
2.85 percent last vear. was
decreasing.

President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. attributed the hike in cost to
inflation and said he suspected
“the same kind of trend in all
colleges.’ The point was men-
tioned that this increase was
one reason why more students
needed financial aid this year
than ever before.

Cornell maintained that the
avowed purpose of Monday's
meeting was to find out ‘‘where
you (the audience) feel the em-
phasis on priorities should be
placed."’

At one point in the meeting,
committee member = and
Associate Professor of
Economics Robert Avinger,
asserted that most people
‘didn't have enough in-
formation to state priorities.”
He noted that the trustees will
have the ‘‘final say” over the

budget.
One of the proposals
suggested at the meeting was a

request by David Kaylor.
associate professor of Religion.
stating that he was ‘‘disturbed"
by the rate increase of faculty
salaries as compared with the
rise in tuition.

He related that in the 1966-67
period, the amount of money

from tuition was $63,000 less than
the total of all Faculty salaries.
In the period of 1970-71. tuition
collected exceeded the total
sum paid to the faculty by about
$421,000. During the 1971-72
school year, tuition exceeded
faculty pay by $578,000.
“Faculty salaries are not
keeping pace with inflation.
We have not been adding the

faculty we need to carry on
our standard of education,’
said Kaylor.

Brown Patterson. professor
of History, said that com-
pared with the 1966 budget the
present faculty salaries amoun-
ted to 114 percent. He added
that this was about the lowest
figure in this year's budget.

Referring to one national
rating, he explained that David-
son's salaries were about the
highest in comparison with
other colleges of the same size.
Yet he pointed out that David-
son was also competing with
small and large universities for
qualified faculty members and
called for salary increases ac-
cordingly. Patterson called
salaries for instructors ‘‘out of
line with other increases."

Another important priority
discussed at the meeting was
the need for increased revenue
directed toward library
facilities. Malcolm Lester,
professor of History. stated
that although this year's total
expenditure for the library was
upped some four percent, the
cost of books as rising 15
percent per year.

A sum of $255,000 was allotted
for the library this year over
$247,000 for the past academic
year. This includes $88.000 for

books. a $1000 increase over
last vear. However, Lester ex-
plained that 360 books were
lost at a net value of $3.360.

Lester noted that he was
“quite aware that-many areas.
especially government and
science, were inadequate.”
This led him to call the four per-
cent increase a ‘‘pitiful in-
crement.” He further stated
that he would like to make ‘‘as
strong a case as possible for a
15 percent increase’ in
next year’s budget.

Housing facilities were
discussed briefly in the meeting
although they do not fall within
the realm of the operating
budget. Cornell said that he had
had a contractor express an
interest in installing 72
living units on North Main
Street.

Cornell said that even though
he responded favorably to the
idea, he had heard no response.
In any case, ‘200 additional
units will be ready by the fall of
1974," he said.

A need was also expressed for
housing for student dates. The
idea of a hostel was mentioned
by one student.

A priority for a coin operated
laundry system was expressed
by Steve Smith. Cornell took
note of the proposal but replied
that the college could not ‘‘cut
off the people involved" in the
laundry, adding that the college
had a responsibility for them.

Cornell related that the ad-
ministration was still looking
for someone to put up “a high
quality motel” on the site set
aside for the purpose. He
projected that someone would

be found by 1974-75, the date of

the completion of 1-77.

Fellow Senator Mitch Purvis
terms the academic calendar
“the number one issue” to be
improved upon.

“I am also concerned with
security around Davidson, even
such little things as the style of
lighting.” Purvis — stated.

Purvis thinks that the housing
Situation is also in need of
evaluation. *‘We have to make
sure that married students have
adequate facilities.’ he said.

Ward and Purvis will be
joined by Bob Cunningham to
complete the Senior class
representation.

Cunningham, who served as
SGA vice president this past
year, agrees with Purvis about
the calendar being the “most
important” issue.

“I'm in favor of splitting the
Winter term the way the SGA

recommended. We've got to
draw some conclusions
through, because if we wait too
long. itll be too late,” Cun-

ningham said.

“[ think there should be
student representation on the
Budget, Buildings and Grounds
Committee (BBG), but this will
take a long time to do.’ he said.

Asked what he thought was
the biggest problem facing the

Elections

Senate in the up-coming year,
Rabil replied. ‘The governance
Situation is the biggest thing.
We've got to get the governance
committee to take some kind of
action.”

Responding to a query on the
Bevan calendar, Rabil said, I
think that unless the students
take some kind of drastic action
in the very near future that
we're stuck with it.”

Returning Senator Butner ex-
pressed similar feelings about
the feeling of the governance
issue. ‘‘This calendar issue is a
good example.” said Butner.
“that students have little or no
influence to get policy
changed."

In his platform statement,
Butner emphasized the calen-
dar, beer in the Union, in-
creased attention to
coeducation, and a night-time
exam period.

Winning on a low -key cam-
paign which consisted of two
posters and some informal
chats was Rick Damewood. *'I
didn't see a need to campaign a
lot.’ said Damewood, “since I
didn't really clash with anyone
else on the issues.”
