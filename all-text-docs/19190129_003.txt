Marshals Elected in Eumenean. -

A very interesting regular program
was rendered at the first regular meeting
of the Eu Society. The new men looked
on with both amazement and admira-
‘tion to the expounding of great truths
by the speakers of the hour.

The program was as follows: (1) W.
B. Sullivan, after a very flowery intro-
duction, centered his thots on the ora-
tion “Checkers; (2) O. M. Dugger
gave a very interesting declaration taken
from President Wilson's speech at the
opening of the Peace Conference; (3)
Debate—Resolved, “That the league of
nations as proposed by President Wilson
should be adopted.” *

The affirmative was upheld by Mit-
chell, J. P. Price and Cummings. ‘Pheir
points were: (a) The league of nations
is a part of the process of evolution; (b)
That it is the only possible league; (c)
That it is practicable.

The negative was defended by:
Woods, R. R. Craig and ‘Hiezir. Their
points were (a) The league of nations
is impracticable; (b) ‘That it is unsound
in principle; (c) It would cause a finan-
cial strain on the world, The decisions
of the committee being in favor of the
affirmative, while the members of the
Hall supported the negative.

The following men were elected to act
as marshals: Chief Marshal, Emery
Flynn; Marshals, S. H. Askew, FE. A.
Turner, §. T. McCloy, C. B. Robson.

Phi Meeting Interesting.

The first meeting of the Phi this spring
was well attended and proved to be very
interesting and instructive to both old
and new members.

J. D. Sample and W. T. Dunlap,
Jr., argued for the proposed League of
Nations, while T. R. Alexander and H.
C. Hamilton strove to prove the fallacy
of such a plan. The decision was ren-
dered in favor of the affirmative.

Morrison, after a most eloquent in-
troduction, gave a declamation, while T.
C. Stone amused the Hall with an
original oration, quite original in fact.

Calhoun and Spense matched their
forensic talents and abilities in an ex-
temporaneous debate. The former was
declared the winner, much to the morti-
fication of his rival.

The critic called attention to the fact
that the carpet had been tracked with
smut owing to a heater pipe that needs
repairing. A committee was appointed
‘to see that the pipe be fixed before the
next meeting.

Someone mentioned that the service
flag needed attention, as there has been

no work done on it since Mr. McClure
left. A committee was appointed to at-
tend to this mater.

The election of marshals will be held
next Saturday night.

All men who have recently joined the
society are requested: to see the treasurer
this week and settle with him. All
initiation fees are due within two weeks
after initiation.

last chance to take off this medal.

PARKER FUEND TO BE
RAISED ‘THIS SPRING

Many new meri on thé campus do not
knew that the Davidson student body
supports Rev, Wan, PL Parker, of Peng-
veng, Korea. Owing to the $8. A. T. C.
last fall, the Parker Fund was neglected,
but this does not mean that he has for-
gotten us, or that our privilege of sup-
porting him has been withdrawn, “Phe
Davidson student bady has always sent
Mr. Parker his full salary every year.
It must not fall down on its duty when
the tremendously increased cost of living,
in the Bar East makes the missionary's
salary more jnsufhcient than ever before.
Mr, Parker is doing a yreat work in
Korea. He was one of the first henor
men of his class here at Davidson, and
was a leader in campus life. ‘The same
winning personality and devotion to duty
thar marked his course here in college
has followed him in Korea,

You will soon be asked to subscribe
to the Parker Fund,

Do your share.

POLITY CLUB IS
BACK ON THE JOB

On last Saturday morning the Da-
vidson Polity Club met and unanimously
elected J. J. Love as secretary to take
the place of M. A. Siske, who was clect-
ed last year but failed to return. Emery
Flinn is the president for this year, and
E.G. Lilly vice-president.

The Davidson Polity Club is a branch
of the society known as the International
Polity Club. Its object is to create in-
terest in the study of international af-
fairs and questions, especially in so far
as they concern America. Owing to the
universal interest in the Peace Confer-
ence and the proposed League of Nations
it is expected that the programs and dis-
cussions this spring will be unusually in-
structive and interesting.

CHAMBERS LEADS.

The Bible classes still further in-
creased their attendance last Sunday.
