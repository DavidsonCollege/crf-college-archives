LIFE SERVICE CONFERENCES CONDUCTED BY

DR. ME

Active Campaign Waged by
Y. M. C. A.: To Help Stu-
dents Solve Life
Problems.

FIVE DAYS ACTIVITY

Young Peoples Worker Aids in
Services by Leading Singing.

Under the auspices of th eCollege
Y. M. C. A., Dr. Melton, former pas-
tor of prominent churches in North
and South Carolina, and now a mem-
ber of the factilty of Columbia Theo-
logical Seminary, conducted the Spring
Life Service Campaign, which closed
last Sunday night.

The series of inspirational services
was begun Wednesday evening and
continued through Sunday, with the
omission of the Saturday evening ser-
vice. Dr. Clark spoke at the chapel
hour each morning in addition to the
main service of the evening, and filled
the pulpit of the Presbyterian church
at both Sunday services.

WEDNESDAY SERVICE

The Call to Service was sounded by
Doctor Clark in his opening sermon.
He took as his text the words of Isaiah,
“Also I heard the voice of the Lord
saying, Whom shall I send? Then

> said I, Here am I, send me.” :

The speaker said in part, “God
speaks in various ways. He calls men
in different ways, but He calls all men
to service. for Him.”

Doctor Clark called into a touching
illustration such as he used throughout
his sermons, which help to drive home
to his hearers the great truths he pro-
pounds.

“When there is a response in our
lives to the will of God, our lives will
become a blessing to the world. Our
lives are made big and grand by car-
rying out His will.

Basketball Manager

In a recent election for the basket-
ball managership of next year, W. Z.
Bradford won out over J. F. Smith
by the narrow margin of four “votes
Both had proved their ability for this
kind of work and it was nip and tuck
as to who should get the position.
Bradford was one of the two assistant
managers last fall.

All indications point toward the 1924
basketball schedule as the best yet.

while Stage Directors Ted Jones,

Faison and Alky Jones are shouting
for the hands to run up the curtain on
the bigest hit of the season—Junior
Speaking.

With four full gloriotis holidays of
freedom from the cares of the world,
the junior class proposes to set a fes-
tivity record that has never been par-
allelled, and that will serve as a worthy
goal toward which all future classes at
Davidson will set their eye. They
present for the pleasure of the stu-
dent body one of the most attractive
programs ever offered at Davidson,
and with the support of the Wildcat
Clan, they have every opportunity of
making the occasion one of history.

Take heed! ye Creoles, lest Mardi
Gras be overshadowed.

The cautions committee who are en-
trusted with the arrangement of the
program for the week-end, are about
as talkative as the proverbial clam,
but they have allowed enough “confi-

sure the students and visitors a jam

he could book for the occasion.

If indications are worth anything,
and if ole man dope doesn’t spill the
beans, the “fire” for the occasion will
come multitudinously and voluminous-

All college property is being heavily
insured and fire equipment installed,
much to the financial distress of the
students and to the jubilant praise of
countless “ikeys and izzies,” who have
hailed from the most modern haber-
dasheries of the country.

The Senior, Sophomore and Fresh-
man classes, in meetings this week,
voted their support to the Junior class
and pledged to carry out the spirit of
Junior Speaking to the fullest degree.

And leave a note of cheer.

A gladsome time for all?

Trip.

scent

In keeping with the progress being
made in College dramatics, the David-
son Dramatic Club is planning to is-
sue a year book that will compare with
similar publications issued by the
North Carolina Playmakers.

The book will probably contain all
the plays written by members of the
Club that have been produced here,
including the casts and probably some
pictures of each. There will also be
a picture of the Dramatic Club. ‘The
write-up, program, etc., of the min-
strel trip will be one of the main ar-
ticles.

IE. T. Woolfolk, president of the
Club, will act as editor-in-chief and
W. J. Cooper as business manager.
The rest of the staff will be chosen
later.

The book will be issued before Com-
mencement if possible and will be sold
to the members of the Student body at
as low a price as is practical. It is

Davidsonian Election

Liston D. Elkins, of Waycross,
Ga., a member of the rising Se-
nior class, was elected editor-in-
chief of the Davidsonian for the
next year at a meeting of the stu-
dent body Tuesday, March 13th.
His opponent was H. R. Jones,
W. Z. Bradford having with-
drawn from the race before the
election.

Elkins is one of the foremost
journalists in the Davidson stu-
dent body and his election comes
as a reward of much time and ef-
fort spent in the interest of the
Davidsonian. He has had sever-
al years’ practical newspaper work
on the staff of a city daily and
three years experience on the Da-
vidsonian. He is well fitted for
the office which he will fill next
year, as he has served in the ca-
pacity of Managing Editor ‘the
present year.

COACH CURRIE’S VERDANT

FOUR STRONG TEAMS 10 BE
QUT BY 1923 GINDER SQUAD

Team Presents Its Strongest
Front in Various Field
Events.

MANY VETERANS

Team to be Determined by Time.
Trial at an Early Date.

In spite of the prevailing bad weath-
er the Wildcat track artists have been
putting ina lot of hard work on Sprunt
Field since the first call for candidates
last month. Several preliminary trials
have been held, atid though the meri
to wear the Red and Black in the first
mect will not be selected for a couple
of weeks yet, Coach Grey has been en-
abled to get a good idea of what mate-
rial he has on hand. ‘The firse meet
is with South Carolina on April 5th
and by that time the squad should >
in pretty good shape.

In the field events the Wildcats
ought to be stronger than ever before,
and in Gracey, Streibich, McCombs
Calhoun and Lindaemood, they have
some strong men to array against thier
opponents. Gracey is the most versa-
tile man on the squad, and last year
was high pon timan for the season, He
is equally at home in the pole vault,
high jump, hurdles, javelin and broad
jump, and wil Igive his opponents trou-
ble in all of them. Streibich was with
the Wildcats in ’21, and is returning for
another year on the hurdles and jumps.
Both Streibich and Gracey are in their
element on the track and are working
hard to make this year the best yet.

Calhoun will probably be the main-
stay in the high jump. Last year the
long boy reached feet 8 inches, but
since that time he has bettered that
mark on several occasions. He has his
eye set at six feet this year.

The loss of Regen, due to a recent
operation, was a hard blow in the
weights, Regen showed promise of
fitting into the place that Big Knight
filled so well last year. With Regen
gone Lindamood will probably do most
of the shot putting, while McCombs
and Gracey will take care of the jave
lin, The discus in one of the events
that is at present untenanted. Several
men are working on it however, and
it is hoped that in a week or two some-
one will be found to fill the place.

In the track events the Wildcats
have only two veterans to rely on.
Leonard Dick, captain in ’21, has de-
serted baseball, and taken up his old
work on the track again. Dick has
short legs but he knows how to cover
the ground and will be a valuable nae

Wildcats Slated for Heaviest
Schedule in Many
Seasons.

Davidson College, the lair of the

Wildcats, is all excited over the Red
and Black baseball machine, 1923 mod-
el, which will make its initial appear-
ance on the diamond next week against
he Oak Ridge aggregation. The Pres
byterian team is not expected to get
very far this season under the load
of the heaviest schedule arranged
for a-Red and Black nine in recent
years. Possibly not, but Buck Currie
has assembled a bunch of youngsters
who are hustling to the limit of their
endurance, and old Man Dope has
been known to slip up on several oc-
casions,
» ‘iVith three weeks’ training behind
them the team has developed a great
deal and will be in prime condition
when Oak Ridge arrives next Friday.
Coach Currie is an exponent of the
peppy, hustling, brainy team that is
filled with the old Wildcat fighting
spirit. That is the type of team Da-
vidson’s opponents may expect to meet
this season.

The problem of finding players who
can crown the horsehide on the trade-
mark is the one that is worrying Boss
Buck just now. If the high class hit-
ting blossoms forth everything will
be as sweet as the sugar in the bowl,
but if it doesn’t—blooie for the Red
and Black.

The pitching staff is Coach Cur-
rie’s pride. Hunter, Boushee and Sor-

Basketball Captain

At a recent meeting of the basket-
ball letter men, Nappy Davis, for three
years a member of the Wildcat Quint,
was elected captain for the season of
1924.

Making his letter the first year at
guard, Nappy played a great game on
the floor and guarded his man like a
leech. Last year, though kept out of
several games, he showed up well, and
this season has had to play the diffi-
cult position of center and guard and
has been shifted to forward in several
contests.

In addition to playing basketball for
three years Nappy is a two-year letter
man in football, making a great show-
ing at end as a receiver of forward
passes.

He is always a fighter, and his elec-
tion as captain insures the Wildcats
a scrappy team next season.
