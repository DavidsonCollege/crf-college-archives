This Saturday Chapel Hill will be
the scene for the largest track ai-

fair in these parts — the Southern].
Conference Indoor .Games. More
entries (over five hyindred) . have
been made in this the fifteenth an-
nual meeting than ever before. As
usual there will be four divisions
of competition — conference, non-
conference, freshman and high
scliool, Host University of North
Carolina will be favored to retain
the conference title which they won
last year.

Although they have had no -suii-
able place inside to work out, three
boys will be wearing the Red and)
Black of Davidson. They are Rog. |
er Cornell, Bill Pritchett, and Bill!
White, Cornell a high jumper, |
who aims to go above the
Sne inch he has cleared: in_ prac-|
tice. Hurdlers Pritchett and White |
have been workihg hard, but‘ they)
will see about the fastest competi- |
tion in. their field. Olympic. star;
Bill. Albans UNC will try. to;
equal -his last year’s feats of break. |
ing records in the‘low and high hur-
dies. Albans will a
Cornell must beat in. the high jump.
Only. last week Bob Morrow, an-)
other UNC ‘star, broke a couple of |
hurdles records up at Maryland. |

Coach Pete Whittle isn't too op-|
timistie for his boys because of the}
very keeness of the competition, |
but he feels that this will be very |
good experience for them. We wish |
the best for these three who are |
really competing in the big | time. |

that they could really play basket-

it. They downed the Wildcats, 81-60,
in a fast-scoring game.

Using a tight zone defense, the
Spiders of Richmond forced David-

permitting them ‘to filter in under

didn’t make it easy for them., The
first half was a good -battle, and
the Spiders had a meager five-point
lead, 35-30, when the first half
was over.

The first eight minutes of the
second half was the deciding part
of the game when Richmond
stripped the nets for 26 points, and
kept'a lead of seven points or more
for the remainder of the ball game.
