Dr. Schenck
Gives Talk
In Phi Hall

Theme of Sunday School Talk
Is God, the Foundation of
Our Faith

Addressing the weekly Sunday
day, Dr. L. B. Schenck chose
his text the 46th Psalm, empha-
sizing the seventh and_last verses.

Dr. Schenck found as the theme
of this Psalm the fact of God as
the foundation of our faith, Tak-
ing the
above,

as

verses mentioned
are the same and
which form a divisional refrain,
“The Lord of hosts with us;
the God of Jacob is’ our refuge,”
he found a two-fold description of
God and a dual statement of His
attitude toward us.

As the “Lord of hosts,’ God
the Hebrew “Jehovah” — the in-
communicable and all-powerful rul-
er of the hosts of the skies, of hea-
ven, and of earth. By this appella-
tion, we are reminded of, the ma-

two
which

is

is

jesty, wisdom,’ and power’ of God
in His Infinite Being .. The “God
of Jacob” is the God of Mankind.
As He blessed and cared for Ja-
cob, mean and deceitful as he was,
will He with us in all
troubles and short-comings. Thus
these two names of God bring be-
fore us the paradox of His infin-

so be our

iteness and His nearness, of His
majesty and His mercy.
The statement, “The Lord of

hosts is with us,” has been shown
by countless examples throughout
the centuries. There an inner
yearning for God within each one

is

of us, and God meets this desire by
placing man in communion. with
Himself — by being with us in all
that we do.

In showing that God is our ref-
uge, Dr. Schenck pointed out that
man’s greatest enemy is fear, and
quoting Joseph Fort Newton and
Basil King, found that God alone
is able to conquer fear. In the chaos
both inside and outside, which
everywhere present, God is our on-
