the good many backs on Davidson's
varsity this year, the one who had
teally stepped, out and shown his
ability for the first time this sea-
son you would have to agreed that
Cliff Turner is the boy who has
come to the forefromt at tailback
for the Cats this year. Cliff is, a
tailback of the hard driving, “run
over him” variety. And when
gets his long legs moving. and
gathers up steam, he is really hard
to stop as the VMI Cadets last year
will testify...It_was_in —-this— yaine
with VMI that Cliff stepped oft on
the varsity when he sparked a touch-
down drive that tied up that excit-
ing game in its last minutes.
Cliff is a junior, hailing out of
Reidsville, N. C. He weighs in at
175 more or_less and stands an, even
six feet. He is 22 years old. Cliff jis
one of the few boys that make a
college football teary without any
previous highschool experience.
Cliif did not play football in high

he

school and the reason he gives is
that his mother wanted him to play
in the band. So play in the band
he did, for five years.

Tn 1940 Chiff decided it was about

: oe ‘
time he gave this football game a

try, so he went out for junior var-
sity. Coach Story saw in him a good
prospect and whe and Coach Jamer-
son worked on Cliff, concentrating
first on his passing. He was one of
the junior varsity stars that year
and his football prowess increased
by leaps And bounds. Then last sea-
son Cliff played varsity ball and
was the star of the VMI homecom-
ing game. This season he really
caine into his own-an The Citadel
game when he scored two touch-
downs, had a third called back, and
made some nice runs. Since that
fgame he has been alternating with
Carl Shepherd and Auburn Lam-
beth at Wdilback and has played
good ball all along. Against Wash
ington and fee last Saturday. he
scored the third Davidson
which came close to tying the Gen
