ago the college press service
distributed this article to col-
lege and university newspapers
all across the country. It con-
tains a major error which makes
it sound as if Davidson is going
to allow fewer women to come
here next year. This is just the
opposite of what the college
trustees recently decided.

Next year's quota will be set
at approximately two to one, a
percentage which College Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencers said
that is just about the same
percentage that male and fe
male applications are running
now. The trustees’ decision has
been interpreted by some ob-
servers as a@ move toward
sex-blind admissions.

At about the same time this

~ story came out, Sports Illus-
trated also ran a negative story
about Davidson, which depicted
Davidson’s basketball recruit-
ment policies as ruthless. That
story basically sems to have
been much more accurate than
the CPS story, but it also
contained several errors.

For several years, going back
perhaps to the Linden affair,
the school seems to have gotten
a very bad press nationally.

(CPS)--A curious thing hap-
pens to admissions aplications
at Davidson College in North
Carolina. When an application
arrives from a male who was in
the top ten percent of his high
school senior class, theres a
, good chance it will be accepted.
But: when it comes from a
female, also in the top ten
percent of her class, there’s a
much greater chance that it will
be rejected.

The phenomenon isn’t an
arbitrary decision by the ad-
missions committee. Instead, it
is part of the small private
school’s admission policy. Last
falls code mandated an enroll-
ment of 250 males and 110
females, or a 54:44 ratio. And
last week Davidsons trustees
amended the rule to admit even
fewer females, at a 65:35 ratio.
They also approved a measure
that would allow administrators

press: sex ratio story all: confused

Why the icilidlastiont The
reasons, Tony Boon of the
admissions office hastens to
explain, have nothing to do
with sexism. Asked for more
specifics, he. added,‘‘Well,
there’s a whole lot of different

-reasons”’ why the school is
- reluctant to consider all appli-

cations equally.

The most telling is "“some-
thing as simple ss tradition.”
‘Davidson was an all-male
school for 136 years before it
decided to admit women in
1973. That decision, moreover,
was prompted by “the feeling
that a single-sex institution is
less appealing’’ than a co-ed
one, and by an anticipated
decrease in the number of
potential students.

Admitting women, which
Boon feels has ‘‘been really
good for the school,’’ wasn’t
welcomed by all college groups.
specifically, the alumni seemed
particularly disgruntled. Some
felt, according to Boon, “ther
needed to be open to men a
special kind of education.” The
fact that alumni are generous to
the school: probably had some-
thing to do with’ the 1976
decision to limit the admission
of women.

A major fear of that time was
that women would choose cour-
ses that weren’t within David-

sons curricular specialty - pre-
professional training. As a re-
sult, the school would have
faced significant extra costs to
hire more professors and ex-
pand xisting facilities. But the
problem, Boon says, never ma-
terialized. ‘“‘By and large, the
women enroll in the same things
men do, and do just as well.”

Whatever the reasons for the
sexual quotas, though, not all

‘ of Davidsons 1300-some stu-

dents are pleased. Six months
ago, senior Martha Sanford
brought a petition signed by
over a quarter of the student
body to administrators. The
petition asked that the quotas
be dropped. ‘No action was
taken. according to The David-
sonian, the student paper.

In February, the campus
National Organization for
Women chapter again ap-
proached administrators, again
asking for equal-access admis-
sions. The group compiled sta-
tistics showing that, of equally-
qualified applicants, 70 percent
of the males were accepted, but
only 58 percent of the women
were accepted.

During the last weekend of
February, thoug, the trustees
reaffirmed the quotas. Boon

was not too hopeful that they’d
be dropped later, either. ‘We're
a traditional school in the
south,’ he sighs. ‘‘The thinking
is a little more conservative.”
