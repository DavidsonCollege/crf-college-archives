say, observed and provided input
when necessary. The school was
represented by Student Solicitors
Mimi Plauche, John Patton, Tom
Price and Deidra Montague.

The defense opened the case
by stating that this violation of the
Code of Responsibility was an
isolated incident between Atchison
and Lopez. They said that Atchison
leftamessage on Lopez’s machine
because he was angered by a fight
that occurred downat SAE involv-
ing Atchison’s roommate Dan
Lamar and Lopez. The defense
mentioned that Atchison did use a
racial slur in the message but the
message itself was not racially
motivated.

The defense called Win Welch
as its first witness. Welch was at
the SAE party the night that the
fightoccurred, November 23, 1991.
Welch described how he observed
Lopez and Lamar playing and
“picking” at one another. He stated
that about ten to fifteen friends of
Lopez’s thought that it was serious
and surrounded them. Lamar was
hit by one of them and Lopez tried
to hold him back.

Welch said that Lamar and
Lopez then lost their temper with
each other and a scuffle ensued
between the two. He stated that
Lopez struck Lamar and that harsh
words were exchanged. Welch
said that he separated them and
Lamar told Lopez to leave the party.
The SAE party was closed but
Welch stated that Lamar had asked
him to come down with him.

After Welch testified, the de-
fense then entered a pledged letter
by Lamar. Lamar is abroad this
semester and could not take part in
the trial. In this testimony Lamar
stated that Lopez led a pack of
people to the bar and Lopez began
verbally assaulting him. He said
that he was hit in the eye and junior
Matt Dormer was also struck.

Lamar said that he didn’t fight
back because of his leg injury.
Lamar’s statement then said that
he went back home and Atchison
returned later intoxicated. Lamar
then told Atchison what happened
at the party and Atchison became
angry. Atchison then called and
left the message on Lopez’s ma-
chine according to Lamar.

The next witness called by the
defense was Lopez. Lopez de-
scribed how he went from BSC to
SAE on November 23, not know-
ing that the SAE party wasaclosed
date function. He said he saw
Lamar at SAE and they began to
push each other in a friendly man-
ner. Lopez stated that his friends
thought it was serious and Lamar
became angry. Lopez then said he
tried to calm Lamar down but
Lamar was irritated and began
cursing at him in his face. Accord-
ing to Lopez, he then “slapped”
Lamar ‘because of these verbal
assaults,

Lopez then described how he
went back to his room and found
the threatening message on the
machine. Hesaid he got very angry
and “steamed up” and wanted to
look for the person who left the
message. Lopez said he thought it
was Lamar, so he called Lamar’s

house and left a message for him
not even realizing that Atchison
was his roommate. He said that he
wasn’t threatening in his message
but was issuing a challenge to go
one and one with him to solve this
problem. Lopez said he saw Lamar
the next day and they argued for
awhile but eventually ended up
apologizing to each other.

Lopez said that over the next
few months he learned through
rumors that Atchison was respon-
sible for the message. Lopez said
that he angrily confronted Atchison
at the Rusk House on January 7
about the message and Atchison
said he had no idea what Lopez
was talking about. Lopez went on
to say that he could understand
why Atchison called, but he obvi-
ously didn’t agree with the racial
slurs. Lopez said that Atchison
and he talked after the defense
advisers contacted them and that
Atchison apologized for leaving
the message.

After the panel questioned
Lopez, the defense called Atchison
as their next witness. He began by
speaking about his multicultural-
ism article that appeared in the
October 28 of The Davidsonian.
Atchison said the article was about
what he thought were problems
with multicultural programs
around the country. Atchison was
then asked to tell what happened
on the night of November 23. He
explained that he did not see the
scuffle between Lopez and Lamar,
but upon returning to his house he
noticed that Lamar’s face was
“marked up.”

Atchison stated that he was
intoxicated and said, “I don’t re-
member what I felt or what went
through my mind.” He said that
Lamar told him that he acted very
angry. Atchison said that Lamar
explained to him what had hap-:
pened and that he and Dormer had
been struck. Afchison then said he
called and left the message with
the point being to “somehow ex-
press my anger to Braulio.” He
stated that he used the racial slur
because it was an angry word and
he was very angry. Atchison said,
“T didn’t remember making the

‘call until I woke up the next morn-

ing and heard the message (from
Lopez) on the answering machine.”

Atchison said that he didn’t
feel he had a committed a Code of
Responsibility violation. He said,
“T didn’t think calling someone
and calling them names wasaCode
of Responsibility.” Atchison said,
“I wasn’t angry when I woke up
(the next day), it (was done) in the
heat of the moment.” Atchison
told about hearing of his message
being played ata forum on campus
tensions that Sunday night. He
said he was “flabbergasted” about
what he said and that it was played
at this forum.

Atchison said he didn’t think it
would be best to apologize to Lopez
at that time so he went to talk with
sophomore Devane Tidwell. When
asked why he didn’t apologize to
Lopez, Atchison said, “I contem-
plated apologizing to Braulio, but
frankly I was scared to.” Atchison
was then asked about the confron-
tation at Rusk. He said that he was
standing at Rusk; and Lopez was in
his face screaming, “You better
getused to it, you better get used to
it.” Atchison then stated thatpeople

got between them and he walked
away.

Atchison was then asked to
explain why he decided to turn
himself in to Dean Terry. He said
that the day preceding his confes-
sion pelice called him inand asked
what was going on between he and
Lopez. The police asked to check
his car for weapons and Atchison
said he decided then that things
had gone too far.

Atchison said that he decided
to have an open case because the
problem had not been addressed
and had festered. 'He said that an
open trial would allow the com-
munity to come and hear the case.
He said once again that he left the
message “because my judgment
was impaired and I was angry.”

The solicitors then asked for
the tape to be submitted and it was
played at the trial. The message is
as follows: “F---ing nigger you got
a lot of nerve, you just watch your
goddamn foreign ass.” Atchison
said he didn’t mean the message to
be a threat but he realized that it
could be construed as that. He said
that he didn’t even know who
Lopez was and when asked if he
had any intentions in making the
call, Atchison said, “I don’t know
if I had any intent, I was angry.”

Former Davidsonian Editor-
in-chief David Thompson wasthen
calledto comment on the article
Atchison wrote for the newspaper
on multiculturalism last semester.
The article had been written in
response to two previous articles
on the multi¢ulturalist debate and
construed by someasaracist piece.
Thompson disagreed, howeverg ‘It
was a side that had not yet been

presented,” hé said. He thought —

that it was certainly a conservative

bent but “not writtenasa gesture of ©

racism or hostility.” Thompson also

noted that no letters to the editor
had been written in complaint.

The next witness was. junior
Robert Dubose who testified on
Lopez’s state of mind on the night
of the altercation at SAE. He said
that 15 to 20 uninvited B.S.C. stu-
dents came to SAE on the 23rd and
appeared to be racially motivated.
After leaving the party and coming
back to the house at about 3:30
a.m. he saw Lopez ina rage, appar-
ently looking for Philip at SAE.
Dubose watched him from the patio
in front of the Commons and saw
him enter the house and wreak
havoc inside.

Eric Rosenbachalso witnessed
Lopez’s trip through SAE and said
that he did his best to calm him
down but that he was essentially
unstoppable. When asked how
Lopez felt after the phone message
Rosenbach replied that he was very
hurtand that he still is notcomfort-
able broaching the subject. He also
said that Lopez became very disil-
lusioned with Davidson after the
entire incident and seriously con-
sidered leaving after Thanksgiv-
ing break to transfer to the Univer-
sity of Florida. Lately, though, he
has thought more about improving
his situation at Davidson and not
leaving for his home state.

Tidwell, a black student anda
friend of Atchison’s, then testified
that Atchisoncame tohim toapolo-
gize for the call and to ask for his
advice,. “He told me what he had
done and I was disappointed in
Phillip.,.He wanted to make itright
with mé.so I wouldn’t have the
wrong idea,” Tidwell said. He
noted that his friendship with
Atchison has become more serious
since thé“incident but’ that they
have been slowly mending since
then. Tidwell said that he did not
offer advice.and told Atchison that

he would have to rectify the prob-
lem with himself: “I can’t tell you
what to do, Philip,” he said.

Tidwell was the last witness
for the defense and the trial then
turned to the solicitor’s side. The
solicitors had questioned most of
the witnesses brought forth by the
defense and therefore had only one
new witness of their own. Patton
started the solicitor’s presentation
by explaining their goal in the trial.
He said, “I feel like our goals have
been misconstrued. This trial is
not about the community. S prob-
lems.”

Patton said that the phone
message was “a threat to Braulio
as an equal member of this com-
munity.” He also explained that
Atchison’s negligence allowed this
problem to foster unchecked. Pat-
ton said that the solicitors’ recom-
mendation was that Atchison be
suspended for the rest of this term
with the option to return in the fall.
Patton also said that if Atchison
received suspension and returned
in the fall that he be required to
spend five to six hours a week
working in the black community
until his graduation. _

Junior Chuck Brooks was the
solicitors’ sole witness. He stated
that he first heard of the phone
message from Lopez the Sunday
afternoonafter the incidentat SAE.
Brooks said, “He was angry, upset,
he wanted to know who did it.”
Brooks also said that the message
made Lopez realize the problems
black students faced at Davidson.
Brooks said, “To me he was upset
about the message. He felt threat-
ened and that stirred a lot of anger
in him.”
