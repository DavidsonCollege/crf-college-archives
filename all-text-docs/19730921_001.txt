By TODD EADES
Associate Editor
(Ed Note: This is the first in a
series dealing with the whole
area of Governance. This in-
stallment focuses on the history
of the problem. )

Quietly, Davidson is moving
towards a major alteration of
its governance system. The
Campus Governance Com-
mittee is preparing recom-
mendations to the Trustees to
establish a new college govern-
mental system to replace an
old, unsatisfactory system: the
present one.

called upon the college to begin
a search for an athletic director
to replace Tom Scott, who will
retire June 31, 1974.

A search committee com-
posed of representatives of
alumni, trustees, faculty, ad-
ministration and students was
established and interned can-
didates throughout the sum-
mer

Approximately 40 candidates
from all parts of the country ap-
plied for the job.

“The committee interviewed
a number of excellent can-
didates from both within the
college and without,’’ Spencer
said ‘“‘Any one of them would
have made a good director. The
committee felt over-
whelmingly, however, that
because of his combination of
talents and experience, the man
recommended is the one for the

job."

With regard to the issue of
athletics, the President said he
will outline the principles on
which he believes a broader and
stronger college should be
based, including a suggested
plan for a re-directed football
program.

Spencer said he will also
report on the financial status of
the college during the last fiscal
year.

On the issue of the Union and
other physical facilities, Spen-
cer said he will report on the
results of a committee which in-
vestigated different locations,
suitable for a Union. He also
said that he will speak to the
problem of other facilities

needed in such areas as
athletics, the fine arts, the
sciences and housing.

“While we may agree on the
many things that are needed at
Daviidson,"’ he said, *‘we must
agree on needs for the next

establishing the committee was
due to concern
munications problems among
campus groups, the cum-
bersome student government
structure, and chairman Walter
Lingle’s personal interest in the
field of campus governance.

The committee was
welcomed by the major campus
groups, who expressed general
dissatisfaction with the present
system and agreed that gover-
nance should be by shared
authority among the major
groups.

The Governance Committee
met seven times dealing with
problems of student conduct
and produced the current
Student Conduct regulations.
This committee of one Trustee,
one administrator, one faculty
member, and one student was
expanded at the eighth meeting
in November, 1971 to three
representatives of each group

Other issues which will be
covered in the speech include
the current status of gover-
nance on the campus, the recent
discussions with regard to the
college's Christian com-
mitment, and the needs of
coeducation.

The speech will be part of the
Opening Convocation which for-
mally signals the beginning of a
new academic year, and honors
the members of the class of 1974
as they become candidates for
the baccalaureate degree.

The convocation will feature
a formal academic procession
with faculty and seniors in full
academic regalia. It will also
include the awarding of the
Alumni Medal to the freshman
of last year with the highest
grade point average, and the
awarding of the Thomas Jef-
ferson Award, given annually
to an outstanding pro-
fessor.

Also at the ceremony two
honorary degrees will be awar-
ded. Receiving the Doctor of
Science Degree will be Dr. P.

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor
The Z. Smith Reynolds Foun-
dation of Winston Salem. N. C.
revealed on June 22 that it will
give Davidson College $2
million by 1977.

In 1964 the Foundation
pledged $5 million in unrestric-
ted endowment to Davidson to
be delivered over an un-
determined time span, in in-
cremental amounts.

year) is having at least one ad-
verse effect: major proposals
are held in abeyance as
modifications of the present
governance system has vir-
tually ceased pending the
establishment of new rules.

At this eighth meeting the
faculty, represented by their
Executive Committee, declined
to designate two additional
members until Presidemt Spen-
cer’s return from India. All
groups agreed that the general
approach would be that of
shared authority by students,
faculty, and administration.

The faculty later named
Alexander McKelway

Cormack (Philosophy) to join
George Abernethy

bers John Miller, William
Muliss, Dean Dickson Phillips,
Walter Lingle, Chairman,; ad-
ministrators Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.

Finance and Development C.

This ‘last gift represents the
final installment.

The grant, one of the largest
ever made to Davidson, was an-
nounced at a luncheon in
Charlotte for leaders of the
state-wide fund-raising Queens-
Davidson Campaign which is
still underway.

Dr. Dale Gramley, executive
director of the Foundation, an-
nounced the gift on behalf of
Foundation President Smith
Bagley of Winston Salem.

Students Will Terry, and
student representatives Danny
Clodfelter '72, Richard Wilson
‘73, and John Hornickel '75. The
present student members are
Hornickle, Bo Phillips ‘74 and
Blain Butner "75.

Most agreements of the com-
mittee at this stage are
necessarily tentative but show
the general movement towards
the ideas to be embodied in the
committee’s recommendations.

“The gift is made on
recognition of the importance of
private support to higher
education, particularly fine in-
dependent colleges like David-
son,’’ Gramley said.

His brief speech stressed the
importance of maintaining
private foundations. Gramley
was critical of government
taxation stating that ‘‘we must
be alert to see that private
causes which serve the public
welfare are not weakened or
destroyed by increasingly
restrictive and punitive tax
legislation.”

Reynolds funds at Davidson
support faculty salaries, library
purchases, and_ several
Reynold’s Distinguished Lec-
tures each year.

Since the grant is an
unrestricted one, the decision
as touseis Davidson's.

C. David Cornell, Vice-
President of Finance and
Development, labeled this kind
of gift as ‘‘the life-blood of the
college.”

The 37-year-old Reynold's
Foundation was established by
the surviving brother and two
sisters of Zachary Smith
Reynolds, youngest child of R.
S. Reynolds, founder of the
Reynolds Tobacco Company.
