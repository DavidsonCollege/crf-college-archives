On Our Own

For those students who delight in
following the machinations of the
Davidson bureaucracy, the administra-
tion has offered up a real gam in
their actions concerning the proposal
that would allow the students to vote
on 24-hour open dorms. __

According to the constitution of the
Residence Hall Association, a move
to make such a major rules change
must be approved by ‘the Student Life
Committee (SLC) and once such ap-
proval is given, the Residence Hall
Council (RHC) can act to implement
the change. However this power is
subject to one major qualification.

According to the constitution. the
rules changes must be approved by
the faculty and trustees if the new
rules would be in conflict with estab-
lished faculty or trustee policy. —

Thus while the RHC took its ideas

to the SLC last week hoping to get
~ permission to allow students to vote
on the liberalized open dorms, they
found themselves thwarted by the
above qualification. :

Wreatient Spencer, letting his opin-
ions on the subject of 24-hour visita-
tion be known,. influenced the com-
mittee to move that the proposal be
passed on to the faculty. :

That there-would be “some doubt
about_this.movemust_have crossed
the minds of the members of the SLC.
In the minutes, of their last meeting
there is a specific reference to “the
press” asking that two of the com-
mittee members explain to “the press”’
the necessity of sending the proposal
to the faculty. :

However we retain our reservations
on this subject.

Just what are the areas of conflict
between the student proposal and the
established policies of the faculty and
trustees?

It would seem to us that the general
thrust of the Code of Responsibility
was and is toward allowing students
to determine their own policies. Sure-
ly the proposal is along those lines.

It also seems ‘that the Code was de-
signed to allow and to help the stu-
dents to mature by giving them great-
er powers to determine their own
positions here at Davidson. Surely
the proposal is along these lines.

It further seems that the major
point of the Code is to accept the
students as responsible for their own
actions. And certainly the liberalized
dorms proposal would be trusting in
the responsibility of the individual
student.

So where are’'the areas of conflict?
Admittedly there is some highly spe-
cific conflict in that the Trustees ap-
proved only 12 hour open dorms in
their original action. However ‘they
did approve open dorms in principle.

The whole conflict seems to boil
dowg,to two questions. One concerns
administrative constitutional peroga-
tive, but the greatest issue is over
the correct interpretation of the Code.

Dr. Spencer has expressed the opin-
ion that one of the nrajor points in
the Code can be seen in the follow-
ing statement, “The Code of Respon-
sibility . . . also recognizes . . » the
individual's involvement in and re-
sponsibility for the corporate well be-
ing of the college community.” And
he is right to say that the Code places
significant emphasis on student re-

sponsibility for the whole community.
But we do not see the RHC Pitposal
as an attack on this responsibility to
the college as a whole.

Rather we would like to. submit that
the major emphasis th the Code can be
found in such statements as, ‘‘Respon-
sible maturity is more likely to de-
velop when a member of the college
community is both free and obligated
to wrestle with principles of conduct
and to accept full responsibility for
his own actions and decisions.”

But the Code is obviously open to
these two interpretations. and is un-
clear as to the relative importance of
each.

It may be that the move of the RHC
to test the constitutionality of the SLC
action will serve only to obfuscate an
already muddled picture.

Perhaps what is more needed is an
expression on the part of the students
to the faculty as to how they inter-
pret the Code and its implementation.
Such an expression might allow future
changes to occur with more openess
and less administrative backstage lob-
bying.

The Last Quip

Quips & Cranks is slipping slowly
into oblivion. Although this has only
become evident recently when no one
put his name in nomination for the
editorship, the slide has been in pro-
gress for some time.

Recent editors have had difficulty
obtaining staff members and have had
to bear the brunt of the work of pub-
lishing the book. Students have been

uncooperative. in submitting pictures, <
making it necessary for the editor to .

spend much time running down rou-
tine shots rather than planning new
approaches.

The absence of an editor presents
an opportunity to analyze the desir-
ability of continuing the Quips &
Cranks without having to contest with
a vested interest. It is our opinion
that the Quips & Cranks has become
a tradition in which students -have
little interest in perpetuating, either

unHappy

On last Monday, the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee rejected the final ap
peal of students who wished to change
the calendar which had been announ-
ced for the 1970-1971 academic year.

The schedule which will be in af-
fect is the one previously announced
in THE DAVIDSONIAN. Under that
calendar, exams will be held when the
students return from Thanksgiving
break.

In an effort to discern student opin-
ion of the published calendar, the
SGA held a referendum which indi-
cated two general student attitudes.

First the plebiscite showed general
displeasure with the published sched-
ule. Second the vote showed that many
of the students would favor a similar

_schedule_but with exams—held-before
Thanksgiving.

Unfortunately the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee felt it could not change
the proposed calendar because of the
late date for the proposed changes
(even though the referendum was
held over a month ago):

Also the committee said it would
be impossible to hold exams before
Thanksgiving because it would con-
flict with part of the football sche-
dule that had-already been drawn up.

We regret that the vast power of such °

minority vested interests as football

,in its present form or in some novel
one.

Quips & Cranks does not fill its
ascribed roll as a record of the year
because most of the book is made
up by the end of the first term and
the rest is completed by February.
Neither is it a commentary on the
year or a complete catalog of achiev-
ment for the same reason.

In light of these facts, it might be
best if the Quips & Cranks died with
this spring's issue. If students are
not willing to cooperate with those
who publish it and if no one can be
found to publish it, perhaps Davidson
does not need an annual at all.

It is unlikely that the demise of
the yearbook will stir any more than
the usual disgruntled reaction that
accompanies the cessation of any ser-
vice to which people are fundament-
ally indifferent.

New Year:

will be part of the cause of an incon-
venience to the student body.

In the light of the problems and
disatisfactions that have come out of
the calendar proposal this year, we
applaud the desire of the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee to adopt a calendar
for the 1971-1972 school year before
the end of the present session.

We also applaud the committee’s
decision to hold an open meeting on
the calendar question, and we urge
students to attend. Only“in this man-
ner can student desires be taken prop-
erly into consideration when the 1971,
1972 calendar is put together.

With regard to student preferences,
the three major opinions about an
ideal calendar cannot be satisfied

simultaneously simply” because of

time limitations between January and
June. These three students desires
seem to be: no split winter term, at,
least a week for spring break, and the

ending of school by the first of June: -

The advent of self-scheduled exams
might alleviate the problem. li might
not. What seems to be needed is an
expression of priorities by both stu-
dents and faculty. A clear idea of ma-
jority opinion would allow the Fat-
ulty Executive Committee to forge
a calendar which ‘would be the best
possible for the most people.

Impact Of Social Changes
Not Good For Lindenwood

(1.P.) “Today’s college
community cannot abdndon
itself to drift with the tide
of social, change,"’ writes
Dr. John Anthony Brown,
president of The Lindenwood
Colleges, in 4 position paper
distributed recently.

The paper was written in
response to.a_ student re-
quest for intervisitation priv-
ileges in student rooms in
both the mens’ and womens’
residence halls. After a
month-long study of the is-
sues involved, the women's
student government with-
drew their request. The
men’s proposal was turned

~ down by the administration

in the four-page position pa-
per prepared by President
Brown,

unparalled in recent history.

is our own affair, unless we
are to abandon ‘all claims
to relevance.

“We now reach the most
important stage of our re-
view of this issue. The right
decision can only be the one
which relates positively to
the mission of The Linden-
wood Colleges. What are
we supposed to be doing in
these times? What is a re-
levant academic -and social
milieu in the 1970's?

Careinenias Of Dark Old Men

The government of these United States is in one

The representative legislative assembly of this
country is more of a gerontocracy than an example
of a democratic body in action. Age and seniority give
t ng tone of a rest home more than vital center of

ebate.

The spectacle of doddering old gents like Cari

. Hayden of Arizona, for.many years president pro tem

of the Senate and high in line of presidential succes-
sion, makes one wonder if the two parties recruit
their candidates from hospital geriatic wards.

And the list of committee chairmen in Congress

makes it look as if they were chosen on the basis of
infirmity and incipient senility rather than on the
basis of ability.
j The good old seniority system, which the found-
ing fathers had the good sense not to write into the
Constitution and probably never expected to develop,
has come to*be one of the most important factors in
the working of the whole government and of the
democracy itself. ‘

One man-one vote is a myth. Power in Congress
rests on seniority, and seniority belongs to the old
fellows who come from backwoods America, the eco-
nomic and political backwaters of the country.

They come from the safe districts and out-of-touch
constituencies which return them election after elec-
tion. ‘These constituencies, the most far removed from
reality in the country, "have by far the most power
and_influence on what legislation goes through Con-
gress.

The old men in Congress who come from Charles-
ton_or_Mississippi_or North Carolina have-little or no
responsibility to the national party platform, because
their constituents will return them all the more cheer-
fully if they ignore the party platform and remain
as. reactionary as ible.

Strict party discipline is not desirable, but strict
party responsibility is. And the responsibility of a
party to the public is impossible to maintain when the
most powerful members of that party in Congress can
do as they please.

The old goats ought to be removed from power
and the seniority system done away with.

The seniority system and the politically and cul
turally remote districts do the most damage in mak-
ing the government unresponsive to the popular will.

Blinking, turning; he glances—
Still, I watch him

I see him (speckled, white on brown)
Choose then grip a seed.
He cracks the shell in half;
The chaff falls to dry earth.
A flutter becomes a brown line
To an oak branch.
Watching from my picture window,
Warm air from the heating duct
Blasts me from my dream.

its own, set apart from reality.

The government has a lot of built-in safeguards
to keep it responsive, the electoral processes, an op-
position party, vociferous press, disgruntled intellec-
tual community, and plenty of insipid public opinion
polls, But, all these lapse into impotence in the face

of the seniority system.

The time has come for

power in Congress to be ~

allocated on the basis of ability, party responsibility
and. popular support rather than age and years in

office.

And we should put the more useless old codgers
to playing shuffleboard and talking about the good
old days rather than running the Congress.

Pledge Classes
Make The Grade

(I.P.) — National scholar-
ship commissioner of his
own social fraternity, Delta
Sigma Phi, Associate Dean
of Students Paul McQuilken
of DePauw University has
completed a study to find
out what makes the dif-
ference between strong-
mediocre and weak frater-
nities, academically.

Dr. McQuilken set out to
find out why freshmen
pledge fraternities, how
freshmen evaluated fratern-
ities before and after 10
weeks, how the pledge spent
his_time—for—70—-consecutive
days, and how thesfraternity
experience affected the
pledge classes’ grades.

Dr. McQuilken” says he
thinks and hopes fraternities
‘will flourish. He pointed out
that since 1940 the number
of chapters has more than
doubled. Over 400 institu-
tions have invited fraterni-
ties and sororities to estab-
lish chapters on their cam-
puses in the last six years.
From 1962 to 1967 an aver-
age of 80 new chapters has
been started per year.

Probably his most start-
ling conclusion was _ that
there is little apparent sign-
ificance between how much
time a pledge class spends
studying and how high its

«DONT BELIEVE IT,”

“grades as they

grades are. (The average
freshman pledge class spent
52.7 hours per week and
spent 52.4 hours per week in
class or in study, according
to his report.)

The research that requir-
ed some 100,000 IBM cards
revealed these significant
signposts about the health of
the fraternity system:

1. After 10 weeks pledges
did not feel their chapter
was as concerned about
initially
thought they were.

2. Fraternities do not seem
to-extract undue amounts of
time to fulfill pledge obliga-
tions.

3. Pledges in general
seemed to be more dissatis-
fied with their physical study
environment than with the
total academic atmosphere
in the fraternity. :

4. Rushes asked’ more pen-
etrating questions about
fraternities than ever be
fore and were unwiiling to
be hurried into pledge de-
cisions.

5. To be of maximum ap
peal fraternities may have
to give strong consideration
to developing programs for
small interest groups.

6. A large majority of
pledges felt there was a

need to narrow the gap be

tween what a_ fraternity
ideally says it is and what
it actually is.

7. Freshman pledges want
to interact with* people who
are friendly, interesting.
loyal, .and intelligent and
who do not create artificial
barriers based
years in school.

“If fraternities are to sur-
vive and be relevant they
must contribute to the edu-
cational purposes of the in-
stifution,”” he concluded.
