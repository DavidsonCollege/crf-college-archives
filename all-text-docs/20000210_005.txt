Jill Ciment: Davidson’s McGee Professor of Creative Writing

By ANNE STANCIL

Staff Writer

“Skeptical, wacky, and charming,” said
Professor Allan Michael Parker in his intro-
duction to Jill Cimént’s reading on Tuesday,
January 5, in the 900 Room.

Jill Ciment and her dog Sadie.

Jill Ciment, Davidson’s McGee Profes-
sor of Creative Writing, read from her work.
Ciment selected a chapter from her first novel
The Law of Falling Bodies , a story of the

RESERVE

relationship between a mother and daughter.
Ciment dazzled the audience with clever hu-
mor and charming characters.

She began her artistic career as aconcep-
tual artist, but she turned to writing. Influ-
enced by Nabokov and Kafka among others,
Ciment considers herself a novelist, though
she has written screenplays.
Novels, she believes, truly
belong tothe writer, whereas
screenplays undergo many
changes during the produc-
tion process.

The author of three novels
and a memoir, Ciment ex-
plains the difference be-
tween the novel and the
memoir in terms of visual
art. She describes writing a
novel as working with a
blank canvas while writing
a memoir is more akin to
sculpting a block of marble.
When writing memoir, the
artist has to work in accord
with the grain of the stone.
Hence a novel has endless
possibilities, while a mem-
oir revolves life’s experi-
ences.

Ciment believes that a bit
of biggraphy is always
present in an author’s writ-
ing. Gloria, Ciment’s
mother’s name, is the name

Falling Bodies. Ironically,
the mother in Half a Life,
Ciment’s memoir, has a dif-
ferent name.

Ciment comes to David-
son after having lived in Los Angeles and
New York City for most her life. Ciment
doesn’t think she has had a truly American
experience. She explains that Los Angeles

of the mother in The Law of

and New York are actually international cit-
ies, and she looks forward to experiences in
Davidson, primarily its warmer temperatures.
Thus far Davidson’s tranquil surroundings
and the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Moorsville
have impressed her the most.

She comes to Davidson to teach. Teach-
ing, she believes, molds a better writer and
person. She explains that teaching makes a
person more analytical, which in turn helps

the writing process.

Ciment sets aside time everyday to write.
She believes that discipline is one of the most
important aspects of writing, a point that she
conveys to her students.

When she is not teaching or writing,
Ciment enjoys swimming and walking Sadie,
a pint sized Dachshund.

Ciment is confident that Davidson will
make a good home for the next three months.
