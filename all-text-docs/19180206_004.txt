C. P, Karriker, ex-’20, is in the avia-
tion section of the army, stationed at
Fort Omaha, Neb. Ina recent letter to
THe DavinsoniaN§ and students, he
writes as follows:

“August 9, 1917, I enlisted in the
United States Army Aviation Section,
but was transferred into the balloon
school shortly after my enlistment. Prob-
ably you would wonder what part the
balloon would have in this great war,
but the balloon is one of the most im-
portant factors in this modern warfare.
However, they do not do any actual
fighting, but they are used for observa-
tion only, and are called the eyes of the
army. They direct all movement of the
artillery and infantry.

“Tf am glad that so many have return-
ed to old Davidson, for 1 feel that they
could not have made a better choice, and
I hope the time will not be afar when I
can return to Davidson College and
there finish my work.”

* * .

The alumni editor would be glad to
hear from other former students, who
are now in the service of Uncle Sam
about their work and other items of in-

terest.
