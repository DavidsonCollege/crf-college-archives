idson, held ‘in Columbia, S. C., last:
Saturday, the Davidson track team by!

first place but .cwo id the entire meet. ,

The feature of the meet was the run-'
ning of Gilchrist. who defeated Planico.'
the nride of Carolina, in both the wm

yard and the 220 \ard dashes.

Because of a misunderstanding of the:
time keepers, the time for the 100 yard!
dash was net recorded. Everyone ‘agrees,
however, thar the tine was unusually
fast—ten seconds flar at least.

The 220 vard dash was one ot the
prettiest races seen in Columbia recent-
ly. Gilchrist. representing Davidson,
was penalized one -vard at othe | start.
Plaxico and Bowen. of Carolina, thus!
held the lead -for the first 120 yards. Bs Ig
