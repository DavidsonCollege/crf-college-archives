FIRST ISSUE OF YOWL
APPEARED LAST WEEK

be moticed that quite a few advertisements
and well-done cartoons constitute a great
part of its make-up. These cartoons are by
“Skip” Brown (artist of the cover design),
Reeves Pope (present editor), W. C. Ragan
_ (editor for 1930-31), G. Murray, Hugh War-
ren Jones, Lorenzo’ McPhail, Jack Williams,
Jr., Mac Manson, and Tom Wood.

When the old Chameleon gave way to the
Yowl in the year 1930-31 it was decided that
the New magazine would not be entirely hu-
morous, but that a small part of it would
continue to be of a serious and literary na-
ture, in honor to the dead. This is found in
the editorials by Pope and verse submitted
by W. W. Caligan, Duncan McBryde, W./L.

Fulgate, and a selection from “Queens‘
Sceptre.”

The remainder of the magazine is com-
posed of the printed humorous matter which
contains a popular Cynic’s Circle. Another
item of great interest is found in the Hurrah
Department, in which national activities of
greatest interest to the students are men-
tioned.

This initial issue shows that Pope and
Ross, new editor and business manager, have
taken some vital steps in making the Yowl
a-bigger and better magazine, both in quan-
tity and quality, giving it a prominent posi-
tion among the important collegiate maga-
zines of the country.

of Chambers, where a short talk on “Ath-

letics at Davidson” will be’ made by Capt.
Norton Pritchett. The alumni will have an
opportunity for remarks at this time. At
12:30 a barbecue for alumni and faculty
members will be held in the small grove to
the rear of Chambers Building.

By far the most interesting event of the
day will take place at 2:30 p. m., when the
Wildcats meet Carolina on Richardson Field.
