... without aid private schools fear losing students

(Continued from page 1)

about Davidson, Spencer ex-
‘plained that the aid program is

“important in that it gives more,

North Carolina students a
chance of coming to Davidson!

‘‘Without the program, it
would have tipped the scales for
some of out students to go to
' other schools.”

The Executive Director of the
North Carolina Association of
Independent Colleges and Uni:
versities echoed Spencer’s com-
ments.

James Olliver said, ‘‘Clearly,
research and statistics have
shown that when tuition in-
creases, you have a shift in
enrollment. That’s been shown
in study after study after study.

**You’re going to lose stu-
dents (without additional aid)

simply because the gap between’

public and private schdo! will
increase. Not having the in-
crease will hurt students’ choice

of attending a private school.”’

Private school leaders argue
that any increase in the aid
program: will ultimately benefit
the private students and the
state.

The letter sent to ABC by
Olliver explains, ‘This year the
independent sector will save the
State nearly $53 million—the
difference between the average
grant of $600 provided to each

of the approximately 26,000 -

undergraduate North Carolini-
ans enrolled in private colleges
vessus the $2800 per-student
subsidy for baccalaureate edu-
cation in the University sys-
tem.”

Put simply, it costs North
Carolina an average of $2800 to
send a student to a state school.
But it costs the state only $600
to send a student to a private
school.

Without the tuition grants to
private students, though, many

students that go to private
colleges would go to public
schools at a much higher cost to
the state.

Olliver also said that the aid
program may “in theory’’ help
non-North Carolina students
attending private schools in the
state by allowing more scholar-
ship money to be available.
“But our statistics only show
that the institutions have con-
tinued to increase support for
in-state and out-of-state stu-
dents.”’ ‘

Cautious optimisni

Private school leaders are
cautiously optimistic about
passage of the increased aid
proposal. Olliver stated, ‘“‘Obvi-
ously we think that our request
is responsible, so we'll see.’

Spencer, who is the immedi-
ate past president of the group

fo private colleges and universi-.

ties, noted, “‘We’re optimistic
about the legislature seeing the

_Although he works closely
with the Union Board, Union

Ashmore, -like Robertson,
was unopposed in his bid for

Union is similar to Pidgeon’s.

necessity for increasing (the
aid).”

But Spencer and Olliver both
expressed concern about the
divisiveness that has surfaced
between public and private
schools whenever the aid pro-
gram is discussed. During a
‘telephone interview from his
Raleigh office, Olliver was
asked if the unanimity of the
UNC board bothered him. He
replied, ‘Yes, it does. The UNC
board has taken this opposing
posture every time the issue has
come up.’

Spencer also replied that the
issue has divided the public and
private sectors. ‘I think there
has been an adversary relation-
ship. Any permanent formula
would take this thing out of the
realm of controversy.”

“The permanent formula that
Spencer suggests has also been
met with disapproval by the
UNC board.

When the private colleges
asked for an endorsement of the
$200 increase from the UNC
board, they additionally reques-
ted that a permanent formula be
established. But the request
was unanimously denied.

Olliver ‘defended the propo-

sal, however. ‘‘A permanent.

formula would resolve the con-

' flict which is apparently divi-

ding the higher education com-
munity.”

The private schools sugges-
ted a formula that would vary
as the costs for educating a
student in the state system
varies. The formula called for
aid to private students up to
one-half of the average per
capita costs to the state for each
undergraduate enrolled in the
UNC system.

It costs the state an average
of $2800 for every student in the
UNC system. If the private
schools fornfula was adopted at
one-half the cost the maxi-
mum suggested, for instance,
the state would provide $1400
for each, private student.

If the cost of attending a
state school jumped to $3000,
then the state would automati-
cally provide $1500 to each
private student.

sion says, “Saithough offered as

policy is not invested with any

characteristic that would bind

those benefitting from it to seek

no change in it in future years.”
Back to legislature

Once again, however, the
legislature will have the final
say. Presently, an ad-hoc legis-
lative committee is preparing to
make a report orf a permanent
formula. According to Olliver,
the Wynne-Puch Committee
was “given the explicit respon-
sibility of formulating a concept
of a permanent operating prin-
ciple.” ‘

Olliver said that committee
had heard “considerable public
testimony,’’ and was ‘‘quite
close to’’ preparing a final
report for presentation to the
legislature.

The constitutionality of pro-
viding state funds to private
schools was tested in early 1977
during a lawsuit. A three-judge
panel ruled that the grants were

constitutional. ;

But one of the judges issued a
warning to the private schools:
If state subsidies become too
large, ‘‘the power to withdraw
them will be the power to
control the private schools they.
benefit.”

Olliver said he never expects
such a development, however,
“There’s always this confusion
about pulling money away from
private schools. Clearly, if the

“money was taken away for some

reason, it would certainly have
some adverse impact on enroll-
ment.

“But this is highly unlikely..
The state realizes that it .is
getting a real bargain for the
state of North Carolina.”

No predictions

Exactly what will happen
when the legislature convenes is
impossible to predict. Members
of the general assembly may
follow the national trend to
reduce spending, and not grant
any increase to the studnets of
private schools,

Or the legislature may conti-
nue its seven-year-old tradition
of assisting private school stu-
dents, and increase aid.

Whatever happens, though,
about 26,00 private school stu-
dents in North. Carolina, inclu-
ding over 400 at Davidson, will
be affected to some extent. Just
how much they will be affected
can be known after the battle
ends sometime in early 1979.
