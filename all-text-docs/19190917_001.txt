“Y” Room Improved;

New Piano Added

Rest Room Now a w a Musical Centre—-
Both Talented and Untalented
Find Great Pleasure There

“Every great institution is the length-
ened shadow of a single man.” So it is
with oar ¥Y. M. C. A, at Davidson.
Several years ago found our social cen-
ter over the old gymnasium in, disuse
and the activities of the association
(which have always played an_ import-
ant rele in campus life) were below par,
Now, through the efforts of a few inter-
ested men, the association is the ‘fist
rank en the hill and evervone is backing
it. To “Bob” Miles we must give nost
of the credit.

The newly furnished room in the

Alumni Gymnasium is one of which the
whole student body should be justly
proud. The new player piano is in use
at almost all hours of the day and
night and one seldom finds the room un-
occupied. Soon a new victrola will re-
place the old one which has not been in
use for the past week. This room af-
fords more pleasure to the students than
any other single means of, its kind on
the hill. You know the old saying about
the devil and idle hands, but at our new
social center loafing times can be spent
in a congenial atmosphere.
_ Is it pretty? Just ask those young
ladies who declared it “darling” and
the older folk who thought it “so at-
tractive.”

CHOICE OF READING.

To even the most discerning reader
often comes the question, ‘What shall
I read next?” With twenty-six thousand
volumes confronting him on almost
every field of study, this is by no means

asy question to answer.

Pavidson i is distinctively a Southern
college, its students coming from homes
over the entire South. This being the
case, why not read some Southern liter-
ature? The average man entering Da-
vidson has read selections from Shakes-
peare, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, and
the other noted dramatists and novelists,
but how many have read about their
own country or their own State? Let’s
make this year our best. Why not have
“Systematic Reading” for a motto and
start with one of the most noted novel-
ists and diplomats of today—Thomas
Nelson Page.

“Y” to Run the Very Very Best Features
Every Friday Night

The contract for the Y. M. C. A.
moving picture for the year has been
signed. Mr. Miles hopes to have one
here for next Friday night. It is the
plan of the committee to have a picture
every Friday night for the entire schol-
astic year. It is quite possible that the
picture will not arrive in time for the
coming Friday but after that things will
move along smoothly.

“Nothing but the best Paramount and
Arteraft pictures are to be shown, In
there pictures such stars as Douglas
Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Marguerite
Clark, John Barrymore, James Pickford.
Dustan Farnum and Wallace Reed are
to be featured.

There is to be no door fee, as the
Y. MLC. A. has charge of it, but any
one desiring to make a contribution will
be given opportunity to do so, A box
will probably be placed at the door so
that all desiring to help in the expense
can give as the, see fit.

As the money for this part of the
“Y" program comes dhectly from = the
students alone, the town people will be
asked to help bear part of the expense.
Although no effort at subscriptions has
been made as yet, several of the town
people have signified -heir wil! ngness to
centribute,

“When will we get our annual?
was one of the first questions every old
man asked when he got back on the
Hill, Each time he received the same
answer, “Nobody knows.”

“Amo Love is supposed to have
shipped the annual by express two or
three days after the close of school, but

according to all reports from the print- ,

er, nothing has been received except the

advertisements. H..B. Brawn, who is
manager of this year’s annual, is com-
municating with Mr. Love and the

publishers, and as soon as anything defi
nite is learned an announcement will be
made. From all the information avail-
able the money, with the exception of
that spent on engravings, is in the hank,
and nothing will be done until ir is de-
cided definitely whether or not the an-
nual will be published.

ing camp at which he received his com-
mission as second lieutenant. He was
in active service in France for over a
year, during which time he was promot-
ed to first lieutenant.

We are glad to welcome Jack back
at college again because, besides being a
good athlete. he is an excellent fellow
in every respect. His position at half-
back has been well filled since he has
heen away but he will have no trouble
in gaining it again this year. With Jack
to help out it looks like Davidson is go-
ing to “mop up” this year.

OSCAR J. THIES, JR., BECOMES
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF
CHEMISTRY.’

Another member has been added to
the faculty, in the department of chem-
istry. Assistant Professor O. J. ‘Thies.
Jr... graduated from Davidson College
in 1918. ‘The year of 1918-1919 he
spent at Boston in the further pursuit of
the study of chemistry. This year he
comes to us to help with the work in
the chemistry department. When asked
something concerning his history, Pro-
fessor ‘Thies remarked, “I hope to have
a better future than a history.”

Why Not Be a Wearer
of the Golden Quill?

Davidsonian to Have Efficient Re-
ports in This Manner

Do vou know what the Golden Quill
is and what it represents?

At the suggestion of our able editor:
in-chief. Dave Roberts, it was decided
last year that the members of the re-
porters’ club of the Davidsonian should
have a reward for their work with a
definite goal for which to work. A pin
made in the form of a quill is now be-
ing designed by an artist to be given to
a limited number of the reporters. “Vhis
pin will be solid gold and will be given
by the Davidsonian to the lucky ones
entitled to it,

‘The exact number to be awarded this
exceptional token of appreciation for
their help cin making the Davidsonian
“The Livest Wire on the Hill,” has not
heen decided. However, every member
of the club has a chance that comes to
no one else. Every article written bv
the reporters is. strictly graded by a
member of the staff, and to remain in
the club, a certain average has to be
maintained. “The Golden Quill will
probably be awardel on this principle
but the average requirement. will be
much higher.

Freshmen will not have. the oppor-
tunity of “making” their quill this year,
but they should begin reporting now
that they may be in line for it next
vear.
