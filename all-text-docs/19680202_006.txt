Plan Trip To Haverford

By JOHN WILLIAMS
_ Staff Writer

Joe Kilpatrick said Tues-
day that he, Pat Mullen and
George Penick will leave
next Thursday on a student
exchange trip to Haverford
College. Haverford, Pa.

Kilpatrick, chairman of the
Student Exchange Commit-
tee, told the Student Council
that the visit would last three
days and that they would sur-
vey every conceivable aspect
of the school.

The purpose of the visit is
to discover both strong and
weak points about. Davidson
College through comparison
with Haverford and to dis-
cover new ideas about college
life which can possibly be ap-
plied at Davidson.

Kilpatrick again encourag
ed faculty members to con-
tact him if they have any
areas which they particularly
want explored.

An attempt to hold a coun
cil meeting on Monday dur-
ing chapet period proved
abortive when too few mem-
bers attended to constitute a
guorum.

At the council meeting a
committee consisting of Geoff
Seamans, Joe Murphy.
Franklin Anderson and a
freshman to be named later
was also picked to select
four students from a list of

about 20 to attend the
IMPACT symposium at Van-
derbiit University in April.

President Tom Earnhardt
told the Council that the Uni-
versity of North Carolina has
invited Davidson to send two
representatives to a Nation-
al Student Association region-
al conference in Atlanta ‘in
March. The Council decided
to choose the delegates at its
next meeting.

McCloskey said. “Un.

(Rusk), I would not consider
it very significant.”

Despite Rusk's apparent
popularity as a candidate.
particularly among students,
some faculty members have
indicated that his age would
be a factor to his disadvan-
tage.

Rusk, who will be 59 next
week. is two years. older
than Martin.

During these post-war
years, Smith pointed out that
the civil rights movement
made significant advances
in the United States. In 1966,
however, the movement be-
came bogged down in conser-
vative legislation.

The stall brought frustra-

Negroes. Many questions
were raised—‘is America
serious?” and ‘does the

Christian church really prac-

No Telephone Chairmen

Resign, Despite Critics

Each of the 30 telephone

chairmen for the first. semes-
ter has retained the position
for this semester, according
to Mrs. Peter Nicholls, Direc-
tor of Student Housing.
“ Mrs. Nicholls noted that no
one chose to resign from his
job after the administration
decided to do away with the
positions at the end of the
school year.

The decision was originally
made in response to charges
that telephone chairmen were
not performing their pre-
scribed duties. The adminis-
tration's decree offered the

chairmen the possibility of
resignation if they wished to
be relieved of their obliga-
tions.

In addition. the statement
addressed to the chairmen
noted that failure to perform
their duties during the sec-
ond semester would result in
more serious action.
