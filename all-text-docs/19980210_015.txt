It was a long night for the Chattanooga
women’s basketball team. The smothering Wild-
cat defense held the Lady Mocs to just 26 percent
shooting from the field and kept a frustrated
Katarika Banks, UTC’s leading scorer, under con-
trol in its 84-56
stomping win.

Brown.

Brown played spectacularly as usual, throw-
ing herself all over the statistical charts, and in
doing so, reaching her third double-double for the
season. She finished with 12 points, six assists,
three blocked shots, and two steals for the evening.

O’Brien and Brown were not the only factors
in the large spread of victory.

At the start of the second half, the Wildcats
spurted out to 17 unanswered points, aided in part
by afresh, new face in the lineup, freshman Jenni-
fer Joslin.

The 5-foot-10 forward out of Minnesota
stepped in big with a three-pointer to cap the 17-0
run, and later in the half, picked up two baskets on
slashing drives.

Joslin finished the evening with a career high
eight points on 3-3 shooting.

“As a freshman, contributing that much was
a real thrill. It was the first time that I made a
significant impact for the team — the first time
that I truly stopped thinking and started playing,”
recapped Joslin.

in all), helped the Wildcats soundly defeat the
Lady Mocs.

Junior Jessica Montrella tipped in 10 points,
while Katy Kamp made a handy contribution of 6
rebounds and eight points.

Danielle Mall also contributed solidly with
six points and five boards.

The easy win over UTC gave the Wildcats
momentum moving into Jan. 31’s Georgia South-
ern game, which had drastic implications for league
standings.

If the Wildcats came out standing, they would
share the first-place position with three other teams.

If they fell, they would plummet to third
place in the league, and Georgia Southern would
stand alone atop the Southern Conference.

Head Coach John Filar knew he had the size
advantage over the Eagles with center Jennifer “J”
Vanlerberghe and forward Jessica Montrella.

The 6-foot-2 towers dominated. the
backboards and eliminated any hope for second
shots by the Eagles. Vanlerberghe ripped down a
game high 15 rebounds, while Montrella came up
with a modest nine boards.

many of which came from inside post moves, a
much needed game for the Wildcats.

The lead changed many times throughout the
game, and with six minutes remaining, the score
was tied again.

The unexpected hero this game was senior
forward Danielle Mall, scoring five points in the
last minutes, including a threepointer that put the
game out of reach for Georgia Southern.

Jen O’Brien had another eight-assist game,
but this time coupled those with 19 points and four
rebounds.

Kerry Brown also played well, finishing just
two points short of her fourth double-double of the
season with eight points and 10 boards.

The 72-65 win gave Georgia Southern its
third loss for the season and pulled the Cats into
first place with Furman, UNC Greensboro, as well
as with the Eagles.

Mark Donnelly becomes Davidson’s winningest Wildcat

GREENSBORO — Senior guard
Mark Donnelly, who leads the team in
scoring with a 15.3 average, quietly
became the winningest basketball player
in Davidson history this week.

The Wildcats’ overtime win over

Chattanooga Wednesday night at Belk

marked Donnelly’s 76th victory in red
and black, more than any other player in
the 90-year annals of the program.

Ironically, the 6-foot-5 Neptune,

*N.J., native scored a season-low four
points on 1-for-9 shooting in the mile-
stone win.

“Mark’s our leader,” energetic
sixth man Ben Ebong said after the
victory against the Mocs. “He doesn’t
have to score for us to win. He does so
many other things on the court.”

“T think that’s kind of the storyline
of Mark’s career here,” coach Bob
McKillop said. “Mark has not made a
name for himself as a prolific scorer.
Mark has not made a name for himself
because he manufactures tremendous
amounts of points, although he has
scored points.

“What he has done is manufacture
wins. Mark is a prolific winner.”

Davidson teams on which
Donnelly has played have won 22, 25,
and 18 games.

This year’s squad, not including
last night’s conteést versus East Tennes-
see St., stands at a dozen wins.

He took a medical leave of ab-
sence in 1994-95.

Erege has surgery

Emeka Erege, the rookie forward
who was just beginning to blossom
before breaking his left leg Jan. 24
against Western Carolina, underwent
surgery Thursday.

‘Doctors inserted a rod to provide
stability and quicken the healing pro-
cess. With the procedure, Erege will
not have to wear a cast and will soon be
able to start rehabilitation on his ankle
and upper leg.

“They expect a complete recov-
ery,” McKillop said. “They also expect
that the recovery will be a little bit
hastened by the fact that a rod was put in
rather than having a cast put on..: It will
give himachance to move around much
more freely.” :

The Davidson coaching staff has
tried to offset Erege’s absence by giv-
ing more minutes to sophomore Jeff
Bergmann and using Billy Armstrong,
mainly a point guard, more at the shoot-
ing guard position.

The support continued

Wildcat at times.

“Our crowd was sensa-

said after the Wildcats’ sec-

carry that over into our arena,
that would be outstanding.”
