NUMBER TWELVE

Charlie Spivak’s Band
To Play At Midwinters

By HENRY BROCKMAN

Charlie Spivak, the man who
lives up to his reputation as
“The Man Who Plays the
Sweetest Trumpet in the
World,’ will bring his top-
flight orchestra to Davidson
College for the Midwinters
Dances on February 20 and 21,
1953.

Spivak is the leader of a nine.
year-old band which rocketed to
top-flight stature so rapidly that
it now ranks among the kings in
the entertainment world. This year
he is placing more emphasis on
soft danceable melodies than ever
before.

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Lawrence Erwin has re-
cently announced the probable
program of events for the week-
end. An informal dance will
be held on Friday, February
20, from nine til one.

The Midwinters formal will be
held on Saturday, February 21,
from eight till twelve. Erwin has
also announced that there will prob-
ably be a concert Saturday after-
noon as well as a late afternoon
tea dance.

Born in New Haven, Con-
necticut, Spivak got his first
trumpet while in grade school.
He studied trumpet through-
out his early life, and was at
an early age a member of the
Dorsey Brothers Orchestra,
where he played alongside such
musicans as Glenn Miller,
Skeets Herfut and Bob Cros-
by.

When Ray Noble came to
America, he asked Miller to help
him organize a band, and the first
musician to be signed’ was Spivak.

When Spivak left to try his
musical wings on his own, he
became the highest paid free
lance trumpeter in radio, play-
ing on the Ford Symphony
Hour, Kate Smith and Fred
Allen broadcasts.

When he felt ready to organize
his own band, a lot of encourage.
ment came from Glenn Miller who
told him he had all the ingredients
necessary for a winning combina-
tion.

YMCA Gift Fund)’

Collects $4,505
To Exceed Goal

By MAURICE CROUSE

As the Davidsonian goes to press
it stems evident that contributions
to the YMCA gift fund will ex-
ceed the goal of $4500. Latest fig-
ures give the total in pledges and
donations as $4504.93,

Many who are returning from
the Christmas holidays will be sur-
prised to know that the goal has
been met. Students who left school
a few days before the holidays saw
that the total was about $400 short
of the quota.

Ernest Barry, chairman of
the gift fund committee, had
left school on Wednesday and
did not know the quota had
been reached until Hubert
Cannon, president of the Y,
informed him by mail.

The goal was met only through
the efforts of President Cunning-
ham and Jim Speed and the gen-

: erosity of the Davidson student

body.

At the chapel exercises on the
last day of school before the holi-
days, President Cunningham — re-
minded the students that David-

_{son students had always met. the

goals they set. He expressed hope
that something might happen be-
fore the day was over to send
the fund over the goal.

Something did happen. The
students were already filing
out of the auditorium at the
close of chapel when Jim
Speed mounted the stage and
made an appeal for more do-
nations. Speed reminded the
students that an extra dollar
from each person would send

, the fund well over its quota.

Then = students began literally
fighting their way back to the
front to make their donations. Dol-
Jar after dollar was placed on
the scales which represented the
progress of the campaign until the
weight of them balanced the scales
and finally over balanced them.

In the confusion that resulted
the members of the committee
were unable to give an accurate
count, although it was evident
that the goal was nearly
reached.

Tabulations made after the re-
turn from the Christmas. holidays
show that gifts of $2671.68 in cash
and just short of $1800 in pledges
had been made, making the total
$33 short of the goal of $4500.

The committee reports that
additional gifts and pledges
have been coming in to such
an extent that there is no ques-
tion but that the goal will be
met.

Canvassers are now collecting
the. pledges which are due on or

College Union Adds
Books, Magazines

In order to provide as many va- _
riations in entertainment as possi-
ble, the new College Union will
subscribe to many of the nation’s
Jeading periodicals and also obtain
a wide variation of books which
will fill the bookcases in the new
lounge.

So that the books and magazines
obtained might be the ones of most
interest to the students, a book
shelf committee, made up of col-
lege students, has been appointed.

Each professor in the depart-
ments of English, history, and
philosophy, was asked to ap-
point one student from his
classes who he thought had
good ability at choosing read.
ing material of interest.

Students serving on the commit-
tee are Chuck Millard, Mike Myers,
larry Dagenhart, Rich Steck, Mac
Bulgin, Bob Mitchell, George Ba-
son, Tom Abel, T, A. Williams, and
Paul Alexander. Dr. W. P. Cum-
ming is serving as faculty advisor.

posed of Abel, Bulgin, and

Dagenhart will, with the help

of Dr. Cumming, deal with

initial details of the book shelf
committee,

The purpose of the committee
is to decide which books and maga-
zines the College Union should
buy. Committee members will wel-
comé suggestions from students on
books they would like to see on the
book shelves in the Union.

Mrs. Nash Holds Marriage

Conference’ For Second Year

Charming and witty, Mrs. Ethel
Nash made on Thursday of this
weck her first return to the Da-
vidson scene in a forum on “Mar-
riage Relations.”

The Y-sponsored speaker led off
her double-jointed junket into mar-
riage and its various aspects with
a talk in chapel on Thursday. The
last half was concluded in a two-
hour session in the Ovens Union
on the night of the same day from
eight to ten.

The engaging Mrs. Nash. whose
husband, Dr. Arnold Nash,
is the James Grey Professor of Re-
ligion at the University of North
Carolina, was outspoken yet tact-
ful in her open discussion of a
subject that proved most interest-
ing to the Davidson students. .

At least some 225 of them volun-
tarily turned out for the night ses-
sion in the Union where the dis-
cussion got down to brass tacks.

Explaining attitudes and inap-
titudes in subjects ranging from
sex standards, the engagement
period, the teaching of medical
and ministerial schools on sex, the
sex relations during engagement,
the biological surety of intercourse,
some standards for selecting a
mate, birth control, the validity of
Freud, the Christian concept of
sex, and numerous others, Mrs.
Nash found an appreciative au-
dience.

In her chapel talk, the marriage
counselor showed how more and
more there was a widening in.
