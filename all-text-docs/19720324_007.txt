Cagers Cap Season With

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

The Davidson cagers capped
off their season last weekend
with a loss to Syracuse Univer
sity in the first round of the Na-
tional Invitational Tournament.

To say a team “‘capped off”
a season with a loss is unusual,
but im the case of the Wildcats
the NIT play was indicative of
the regular season—very good,
but disappointing.

Throughout the season the

Cats seemed to constantly be

on the verge of living up to
their potential.

They played consistently well,
winning 19 games, but injuries
and off-nights kept them from
being great. Davidson's nine
losses seemed to come at just
the .wrong times.

Three of those losses were
sustained against Southern Con-
ference teams, cne of those in
the semifinals of the tourna-
ment. That loss to ECU pre-
vented Davidson's participation
in the NCAA regionals.

After the SC tourney, the Cats

got another chance to try for
their twentieth win in the NIT,
but lost 81-77 to the Orange.
“We played horribly,” com-
mented pointman Mike Sorren-
tino. “‘We didn’t shoot well or
control the boards like we
should have.
The Cats seemed to have the
edge in talent and size, but were
never able to capitalize on any
of the breaks during the game.
The game was a defensive
contest, especially during the
first half when both teams rac-
ed back and forth up the court

Split Skippers Bounce Back
To Take First Win At UVA

With poor showings in their
first two competitions behind
them, the Davidson College Sail-
ing Team cruised to its first
win this year last Saturday at
the University of Virginia.

Entering in two South Atlantic
Collegiate Sailing Association
regattas that day, the second
half of the team travelled to
the University of South Caro-
lina while the winding side was
making it big in Charlottesville.

Using their Coronado 15 boats
against a field comprised of host
U.Va., Old Dominion and Chris-
topher Newport College, co-cap-
tains Jim Hunter and Allen Lun-
dy each. piloted their way to
first place on Lake Monticello
with identical finishes of two
firsts and two seconds apiece.

Moreover, Lundy was named
low-point skipper of his divi-
sion, while Hunter tied for the
same honor in his class. Fresh-
man Harris Ricks crewed for
both men in all eight of the
races.

that “the regatta was run well”
were the two key factors in the
Davidson triumph, according to
Hunter.

He was quick to add, howev-
er, that ‘the competition wasn’t
as keen as it had been in the
other regattas.”

Indeed, against Clemson in
the first match of the year, the
Cats could only muster a fourth
place out of the six competing
colleges, and fared even worse
the next time, ending up with
last place in the field against
The Citadel at Charleston.

The second half of the team
fell far short of their teammates
achievements, however, as the
efforts of Clement Rousseng and
Daryl Douglas yielded only last
place opposed to a tough lineup
of USC, Clemson, The Citadel
and the College of Charleston.

Skippering their Penguin craft,
Rossenq came up with first and
third place finishes, but was un-
fortunately disqualified in his
last event. Douglas, meanwhile,
ended up with two seconds and
a third.

The Cats have their eyes on
the Conference championship,
though, which will be held at
Lake Norman on April 22.

In the immediate future, how-
ever, lies a very tough regatta
on April 8 as Davidson hosts
Duke and the Lake Norman
Yacht Club.

trying to convert turnovers into
points.

Both teams failed in their ef-
forts at quick points, but the
Orange profited much more than
the Cats.

“‘We just couldn’t get back
fast enough,” Sorrentino said.
“We hadn’t practiced the week
before the tournament, and we
were slow and out of shape.”

The Cats were also bigger un-
der the boards than the Orange,
but did not do as well in re-
bounding as their opponents.
One of the reasons was the of-
ficiating.

The officials in the tourna-
ment were lenient in calling
fouls, and the Davidson team,
used to picky Southern Confer-
ence referees, could not adjust
as quickly as the Orange.

The game became very phys-
ical under the boards, and the
outsized Orange pulled in 53
game rebounds as opposed to
the Cats’ 39.

Both teams shot’ poorly, the
Cats hitting 42 per cent from
the floor and the Orange 40 per
cent.

The events of the Syracuse
game could be extended to de-
scribe the entire season.

The Cats started off the sea-
son poorly, losing two early
Southern Conference games, but
bounced back after Christmas
to play exceptionally well.

Then, about half way into the
regular season, several key play-
ers, notably John Falconi and
Joe Sutter, became injured or
ill.

Sorrentino pointed to this peri-
od, the part of the season that
included the win at St. Johns
and later the defeat of Prince-
ton, as the peak of the season.

‘‘We were playing at our best
then,” he said. “At that time
we could have beaten almost
any team in the NIT.”

Both St. Johns amd Princeton
did well in the New York tour-
nament.

Guard Marshall Case saw the
overall season in different terms.

“The South Carolina game was
our. emotional peak,” he said.
“After they beat us in Char-
lotte, the Conference tourney
was a letdown.”

Despite these key losses, the

NIT Loss

team faired well, especially well
for one with cnly three return-
ing lettermen.

Eric Muinkin, John Pecorak
and Joe Sutter improved over
last year’s play, and Falconi.
Sorrentino, Steve Gadaire, Case,
T. J. Pecorak and Paul Wag
ner all proved their value to
the team, and all, save Minkin,
will return.

So, the team closes its sea-
son with 19 wins, a substantial
record, some distasteful losses,
and a great amount of optimism
for next year.

“Next year they'll win 25,”
was Minkin’s prediction.
