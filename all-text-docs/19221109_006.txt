DELTA PI KAPPA HOLDS

INTERESTING MEETING

The Delta Pi Kappa fraternity held
its regular meeting Hriday night in the
Bachelor’s Hall. R. R. Jones was
taken in and read a paper on ‘The
Comparative Strength and Weakness
of North Carolina College News-
papers.” L. D. Elkins then gave an
original human interest story.

Discussion was taken up of the ex-
tension work of the fraternity. A pro-
gram committee was appointed and a
progressive list of talks relative to’
journalistic history and principles are
to be given during this year. The
members are interested in getting
active newspaper men.to come to Da-
vidson and speak to those interested in
such work and temporary plans were
outlined at this meeting to get such
men here in the future.

The Delta Pi Kappa fraternity is
composed of a group of the outstand-
ing journalistic men of the college. The
work of this group is pressing forward
with great strides and the aim of each
member more enthusiastic and
energetic work for this year. The
members believe they have a good
thing in their organization and plan to
share it with others,

HALLOWE’N RESPONSIBLE
FOR MANY QUEER LIGHTS

Owing to some rapacious caprice of
various members of the college wreck-
ing crew headed by Mr. Stiles on their
annual Hallowe’en rampage, many
noteworthy endeavors of.certain mem-
bers of the Greater Davidson Club
came to naught.

Monday night, the 31st of October,
under the mystic light of the crescent
moon, a noble and daring band of
loyal Davidsonians ventured abroad
upon the campus bent upon deeds
which they hoped would add materially
to the wealth of college tradition,
vastly glorify the revered name of Da-
vidson College, and amuse those few
members of the faculty which have a
keen sense of humor. ,

Working in feverish haste, guided
by a peculiar sense of the appropriate,
a magnificent throne was established in
‘the neighborhood of the old well,
whereon was set with great pomp and
circumstances, in_a-lordly and graceful
posture Doctor McConnell’s favorite
skeleton. With still more feverish
haste, with drawn faces and tormented
olfactory nerves, several ardent pur-
suers of the alchemists’ science mingled
potions, near the seat of French wis-
dom, and then effected a strategic re-
treat to a safe distance where they
soothed their offended nasal appen-
deges by counter irritation. The
greatest of all their accomplishments,
however, was the skillful contrivance
of a magnificent float on the southern
portico of the library building. The
structure of the float was a borrowed
wagon, maneuvered to its unique en-
vironment with the greatest circum-
spection and dispatch, whereon was set
a large cylindrical iron receptacle for
antiquated documents and manu-
scripts. The decorating of the float
was exceedingly appropriate, and was
executed with consumate skill and
propriety, and in accordance with the
most esthetic dialistic taste of the
present generation. From end to end,
from wheel to wheel, from corner to
corner, the embelishments were a
uniform pure white.

As the fervent workers were putting
the last few finishings touches to their
etherial work of esthetic grace and
symetry, they suddenly paused, ‘They
beheld approaching along the dim
pathway a figure shrowded in a long
robe. Nearer and nearer it came,
stalking in a slow and dignified, and
yet ina very determined manner. They
gazed spellbound with fear for an in-
stant, then one of them sneezed. ‘The
spell was broken, and in the twinkling
of an eye they fled to the four corners
of the campus as John D. Laws
strolled up and surveyed their work
a critical eye.

FRANK JOHNSTON TELLS
POLITY CLUB OF RUSSIA

Owing to the numerous other activi-
ties on the ‘Hill, the meeting of the
Polity Club last week was cut ‘short.
I, S. Johnston delivered an excellent
entrance thesis on the subject,“ Some
of the Things We Ought to Know
About Russia.”

The result of his thesis showed that
no one knows much about Russia, She
is under the power of the Bolsheviki,
in a state of helplessness and terrorism.
H. G. Wells, historian, after spending
three weeks in Russia at the invitation
of the Bolsheviki government, declared
that country to be in a peaceful condi-
tion, which declaration is manifestly
untrue.

Guided by the foreign policy of the
Solsheviki, Russia lost 780,000 square
kilometers of territory, 30 per cent of
her entire population, 33 per cent of
her total mileage of railways, 73 per
cent of her total iron production and
89 per cent of her total coal produc-
tion. As a result of the Bolsheviki
internal policy, Russia has come-into
a condition of utmost disorganization
in her industries, transportation and
finance.

Despite these conditions, the Rus-
sian people are not in sympathy with
the Bolsheviki rule and eventually they
will throw this burden and bloom into
a powerful democracy.

PHI MEN URGED OUT FOR
COLLEGIATE DEBATE

At the Phi Society meeting last
Chursday night, the house was opened
for some discussion as to why every
one should enter the Intercollegiate
The president urged all who
could to go out for this debate. All
the Juniors and Seniors were re-
quested to pafticipate in the Junior-
Senior debate to be held this month.

An oration by J. W. Baldwin on
“The Reward of Work” jas one ot
‘the best to be heard in that hall in
quite a while. Baldwin has all the
qualities of an orator, his floor position
and enunciation are above par. ‘

The debate with McGirt and Buck
on the affirmative, Johnstone and
Cochrane on, the negative, was con-
tested with pep and vim. The judges
awarded the decision to the negative.

W. P. Brown served as critic, as the
regular critic was on the program,

METROPHILIANS HOLD

USUAL WEEKLY MEETING

The Metrophilians held one of the
best meetings of the year on last Tues-
day night.

The subject for debate was, Re-
solved, That the United States should
recognize the Soviet government of
Russia. Kimsey and Bradford upheld
the affirmative while Furches and
Hodgin were on the negative. The
debate was very good in‘ view of the
fact that two of the speeches were im-
promptu, the points being hotly con-
tested. The judges decided in favor of
the affirmative.

Instead of the extemporaneous de-
bate and declamations, three orations
were delivered. Messrs. Kimsey,
Gracy .and Trawick delivered very
forceful orations.

upheld by Gibbs and O’Connor against
Price and Franklin, who were ap-
pointed to’ take the places of the de-
baters who were absent. The house
acted as judges and the decision was
awarded. to the affirmative by a
majority of only one vote.

AESCULAPIAN CLUB

PLANS FOR THE YEAR

The disciples_of the famous old
Grecian god of medicine, Aesculapius,
or the members of the Aessulapian
Club, are looking forward to a pro-
gram that will be really helpful as well
as interesting this year. The club is
composed of men who have chosen the
profession of medicine as their life
work,

After a lapse into inactivity for the
past two years, the Aescalapians have
effected a complete reorganization and
have set out to accomplish some really
worth while things this year. The re-
organization was started by the elec-
tion of officers of the club. Frank
Wildman was elected president; J. B.
Sloan, vice-president; Joe Baldwin,
secretary, and Harry Wildman, treas-
urer. ye

This year plans have been made to
have members of the club speak on
subjects of practical value to future
medical students, and then later in the
year, outside men of high standing in
the medical world will address the
club,

The club has started the year off in
a rush and has experienced a phenom-
enal growth. At the beginning of
the year there were but five members

but since that time 33 have been
initiated, making a total of 38 now in
the club.

MAGAZINE STAFF PLANS

CHANGE IN MAGAZINE

The magazine staff met on the 26th
of October to discuss plans for the
Davidson College magazine for the
coming year. It is the intention of the
staff to make this year’s magazine
much more lively and interesting than
it has ever been before and to improve
upon it in every way that they can.
Among other things it was decided
that each issue of the magazine will
contain between 48 and 62 pages,
almost three times the size of last
year’s issues. They plan also to
change the cover design somewhat.

The first issue will come out about
the first of December and all material
for this number must be handed in at
once.

ANTHOLOGY OF SHORT

STORIES TO BE PUBLISHED

Hark! Ye literary light of David-
son! An anthology of the best short
stories appearing in the collegiate
magazines of the State this year will
be compiled the latter part of next
spring. A valuable prize will be
awarded the writer of the best story.
The board ‘of judges will consfst of
persons high in literary circles outside
of the State.

As far as it is known, North Caro-
lina is the only State in the old U. S.
that puts on such a contest. Why
should Davidson not lead the State and
thereby lead the country? Now is the
time to begin. Get down to deep study,
rake up odd reminiscences, brush off
the slumbering imagination, and start
at once turning in your’ stories to the
Davidson College magazine.

At a meeting of the North Carolina
Collegeiate Press Association, the

foriginator and promoter of this move,

a special committee was appointed to
attend to such details as compiling the
anthology, securing the judges, and
arranging for the prizes. This com-
mittee is composed of Alice Lowe
(Meredith), Nell Craig (N. C. C.
W.), W. F. Cash (Wake Forest), and
R. S. Pickens (Carolina).

COMMISSARY DAZZLES
STUDENTS WITH LIGHT

Charlotte hasn’t got anything on
Davidson. The beautiful Queen City
with all its wonderful electrical dis-
play, intermittent advertisements, great
white ways, and bewildering dazzle-
ment of artificial brilliance need not
think for one moment that it can put
Davidson in the shade. Which of us
happening in the neighborhood of the
ommissary at night has not been
astonished ,and dumbfounded by the
marvelous display of electrical splen-
dor? The managers of the Commis-
sary can not be commended too highly
for their achievement. In addition to
the ineffable embellishment to the
campus that their ‘contrivance has
proven itself, it is really a stroke of
remarkable advertising genius on their

part. Certain individuals have main-

{

tained that to have such a wonderful
light illuminate: only an immaculate
bulletin board was - unspeakable
economic folly, but that only shows the
shallowness of their intellects and the
grossness of their esthetic senses. It
has been conceded that the Washing-
ton monument, which, as we all know,
is an unadorned pillar of solid
masonry, with no trivial decorations to
detract from the substantial grandeur
of itself, is the most sublime of all
monuments. Similarly, the bare sim-
plicity of the advertisement is its
greatest asset. Would not any one
relish infinitely more, “hot P-nuts”
sold at the base of a white bulletin
board, majestically devoid of all
superficial and frivolous graphical
decorations, than ordinary gubers
sold elsewhere ?

ROOSTERS FIGHT FOR
RIGHTS OF SENIORITY

Disobeying the laws of the seventh
day, Red Brass and Domineck Bill Joe
met in mortal combat last Sunday be-
hind the barn of Doctor McConnell to
decide the supremacy of the flock. For
some time the feathers flew and the
blood ran freely. After a while, things
cleared up and the action became im-
peded to the extent that the spectators
could determine the winner,

As the bell rang calling the hungry
patrons of the trough to dinner, each
expressed his opinion that Domineck
Bill Joe had won a pressing victory
over Red Brass. It was generally be-
lieved, too, that the fighters would look
better on a dinner plate, than out in the
professor's barnyard setting such bad
examples for the erstwhile reverent
student body of Davidson College.

SCRUB AND FRESHMAN
TEAMS PLAY THIS WEEK

Because of changes made necessary
by N. C. State cancelling her contract,
the Davidson scrubs and Freshmen
eleven will swap their fields of action
this coming week-erid. Instead of the
Freshmen playing the N. C. State
Fresh in Pinehurst, as originally plan-
ned, the second teams of the two col-
leges will meet at the resort. The
Wildcat Yearling in turn will take the
scrubs’ place at Wilmington and clash
with the Wilmington Light Infantry.
The scrub game at Pinehurst will
be played-on Thursday before a large
Sand Hills fair crowd. It will be the
third time the teams have met and a
close and interesting game is sure to
result. In 1920 the affair ended in a
6-6 deadlock, but last year the Raleigh
lads carried off a victory. The Pres-
byterian eleven has not been defeated
this year, however, and expect to turn
in another victory that will more than
make up for the set-back of last year.
On Armistice Day the Freshmen
will meet the strongest independent
team in the State when they tackle the
Wilmington Light Infantry. The

eastern lads have many former college
and prep school stars in their line-up,
and while they will probably be a little
out of shape, they are sure to render
a good account of themselves.

The Davidson: first year men got
away to a bad start this fall, but judg-
ing by their victory over the strong
Oak Ridge eleven, they have struck
their real stride now and will step
lively in their remaining games. Cap-
tain George has been smoothing many
wrinkles out of his charges each after-
noon and will present a dangerous line-
up against the national guardsmen
Saturday.

Fight! Wildcats, Fight!

SCRUBS SCORE IN FINAL
MINUTES OF LAST HALF

Coming from behind in the last few
moments of the game, the Davidson
scrub team overpowered Monroe High
School, 7 to 3, in a struggle replete
with thrills, in Monroe last Saturday
afternoon. The Red and Black team
missed most of their breaks in the first
three quarters, carrying the ball the
length of the field three times only to
lose it-inside the 10-yard line._ In the
first quarter Monroe jumped into the
lead by drop-kicking a field goal from
the 25-yard line. The game was wit-
nessed by a large and noisy crowd.

Monroe had a fast and heavy team
and gave the scrubs a hard fight before
going down in defeat. They were'ably
assisted by the referee who imposed
many péfalties upon the Wildcat team.
Monroe has one of the best high
school teams in Western Carolina and
will be seen on Sprunt Field this week-
end.

The scrubs threatened often in the
early quarters. Covington made the
longest gains of the day when on two
occasions he broke through the high’s
line for 35 yard gains. The line
smashing of Ballard and the passing of
Robbins also contributed much valua-
ble yardage. But on one occasion Da-
vidson fumbled on their one-foot line
and a few-moments later they had a
pass intercepted inside the 10-yard
mark,

In the final period the Wildkittens
started their successful march down
the field. Beginning on their own 20-
yard line they carried the oval straight
down the field for a touchdown, Bal-
lard driving the pigskin over. Hodgin
kicked goal.

Ballard, Green and Covington were
the outstanding backfield stars while
Briggs, Mog## and Hodgin did stellar
work in the line.

T).

Furman seems to have come back
again after their defeat by Richmond
and last week the Hurricane blew
Erskine out of the way by the decisive
score of 67-6. P.C. only beat Erskine
19-0 and Elon turned them in 10-0,
so that makes another score to put on
the Furman side of | the ledger.
