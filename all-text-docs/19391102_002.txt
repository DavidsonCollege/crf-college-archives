Fred Waring has written us an alma
maier hymn. The entire student body has

heard the-zeng hut of course it hasn't been
adopted as the “otficia) aima mater areca |

|

-wi Davidson. Ccllege” When Waring agreed
to write this song he stated that ii we
did not want to accept it, ior any reason
whatsoever, it would be all right. Eciore
we hastily aecept this song we. should dig
deeper into the subject.

— Possibly many af you do not know that

“several vears ago. Dr. G. M. Maxwell, an
alumnus of Davidson College, wrote an
alma mater tot Davidson. The music was
arranged by our own james Christian Pfohl
and it was written in connection with our
Centennial program. It was never adopted,
in fact it has never received a fair chance.
Many of the students have not heard it.

Of course it's nice to have an alma mater
written by such a eclebrity as Fred Waring.
“But we must remember this—Waring did
this for publictty's sake. as an advertisement:
ior Chesterfield cigarettes. We wrdte an=_
other song two weeks ago for another
sehool, Akron Cotlege, and is writing an-
other next week for some other school.

Dr, Masweii wrote his for Davidson, and
Davidson alone. . He is interested in David-
son, its doings and its sueceess. Fred War-
ing is not. The arrangement was done_by
one of our own Professors. In other words,
this alma mater was written for Davidson,
by Davidsonrtns, and has all the tradition,
beauty, and color that an alma mater should
have.

“Before we jump in and accept Fred War-

—ng’salma mater hymn, we should give Dr.
_Maxiwell’s song a-chance. It's the least we
could do. 7

The song has already been published. Da-
vidson’s fine band.could. give their rendition
of the song and we could compare it with
Fred Waring’s. Then if Waring’s song still
seemed to be the best of the two we could
accept it as “oificial,” but let’s give dur own
alumni a chance.

Here are the words to Dr. Maxwell’s

song:
ALL HAIL! O DAVIDSON!
All hail! O Davidson, Our dear old Alma

thee;

And still today their loyal sons undaunted,

Follow them on, and pledge their loyalty.

Good Gamblers Don’t Bet In College
- Football Pools!

That’s the concensus of the big-time grid-
iron money experts in Minneapolis, Minn.,
of what has become one of the big branches
of the betting industry, for it was here that
gambling on football results was started
in 1912. - _

Here’s the way “one of the boys” describ-
es the odds against you cash-in on a pick-
the-winners ticket: “I’ll bet you 200 to one
you can’t flip a coin and make it come up
heads 10 times out of 10. Same way with

--picking-football winners. It just isn’t-done.”__|

The one sure thing about the whole busi-
-ness~is that the betting commissioners>al=—
ways win, whether it's 10 per. cent average |
on their straight odds on bets, or 30 to 50
per cent on their parlays.

BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY

The foreign policy_of any staté
is always the product of a combina-
tion of ,factors some of which are
permanent and = some’. transitory.

r This 3s a truth which one must keep

in mind inorder to understand the
politits of Prime Minister Ghamb-
erlain,

Among the permanent factors, |
one ‘must consider traditional poli-
cies which have been adhered to
ior a very long time such as that
no great powersheuld control Hol-
land and Belgium, that no country
be allowed to establish its hege-
mony over Europe (the famous
balance of power policy), that the
British navy should never be small-

‘ler than the tombined navies of its

two nearest rivals (the so-called
two-powér standard). These policies
are dteply rooted in the political
consciousness of the average Eng-
lishman and have as their watch-
dogs the permanent career men in
the Forcign Office.

A second. group of permanent fac
tors_is traceable to national char-
acteristics. It is generally true the
British have a profound: aversion
to’ definite commitnieats. They
would doubtless follow a policy of
Ho chtangling alliances if they
could:-In-view of this characteristic,
Premier Daladier has shown great
wisdom in letting Chambertain take
the leading in forming the anti-
Hitler bloc because that was the
only sure way of maintaining Fran-
co-British solidarity. The French
would always go as far as the Brit-

‘lish, but not vice versa.

-It is also worthy of note that the
British have a kind of moral code

which, although somewhat vague

and, clastic, is nevertheless -very

The wansitory factors depend on
the party jy power (especially the
nature of fhat party's, leadership)
and the diplomatic situation in ex-
istence at any given moment. The
present British Government, de-
spite recent reshuffling, is essenti-’

when Chamberlain went. begging

who did not want them.

This shows that in spite of the
amazing perfection. of the political
machine of the Conservative party,
the Chamberlain Government could
not disregard for any length of time
the traditional moral factors prized
by the British people. Elections are
