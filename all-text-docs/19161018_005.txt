DAVIDSON COLLEGE DAY
ON OCTOBER 26TH

As is customary in nearly all colleges,
one day in éach collegiate year is reserv-
ed for the observance of the Founder's
Day, or the College Day, as it is called
at Davidson. At this time a prominent
alumnus usually makes an address. Such
men as Dr. Henry Shepherd, of Balti-
more; ex-Governor Glenn, of North
Carolina, Dr. Currell, President of the
University of South Carolina, have been
speakers here in the past.

Thursday week, October 26, has been
set aside this year for the annual celebra-
tion of Davidson College Day, Dr.
Thornton Whaling, of Columbia, S. C.,
having been secured as the speaker.
While no definite plans have been an-
nounced by the Faculty, it is supposed
that the exercises will be. carried on as
in the past, that is, the early chapel
period will be postponed until 11 a. m.
The exercises will begin at this hour,
classes being suspended for the rest of

‘the morning.

GOLF NEWS.

The golf course is occupied almost
every afternoon that the weather allows.
Several new men have joined the club,
and many enthusiasts of last year are
to be seen on the links. Among the old
men playing this year are: Hall, Korne-
gay, Chambliss, Nisbet, Roddey, Hen-
derson and Howard. Dr. Arbuckle and
Professors Wood and Currie are also
plaving.

The course is rather rough now ow-
ing to the grass, but it will soon be put
in good shape. The club is verv an-
xious to add new men to its roll. A
larger enrollment would enable the club
to improve the course.

All who have any old clothes are re-
quested to send them to Mrs. Paisley
or to Mrs. W. R. Grey to be forwarded
to Mrs. Sloop’s Mountain School. Con-
tributions sent in will be much appreci-
ated as they are a great aid to Mrs.

Representative | Sloop in her work.

OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

College Topics—The Topics is advo-
cating the worth and advisability of
playing tennis on Sunday afternoon at
the University of Virginia. The editor
believes that “such Sunday observance
more nearly approaches the religion of
the Great Teacher than the puritanical,
‘over-pious observance of those who fa-
vor blue laws.”

The Reveille—The Co-Eds at the
Louisiana State University are acting as
ushers in the Columbia Theater of Ba-
ton Rouge, La. They are receiving the
salaries of regular ushers and will turn
this compensation over to the Alumnae
Loan Fund. which is being used to assist
girls who otherwise would be unable to
attend L. S. U.

The Tar-heel—A Freshman Debat-
ing Club has been organized at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. The purpose
of the club is to afford an outlet to the
interest in debating which the men have
acquired in their High School work, and
it is not intended to enter competition

with the two Literary Societies.

The Red and Black—Iw a “petto

at the University of Georgia, the men
of 1920 decided to continue the practice
of wearing the red caps with the black

promoted class spirit, but also college
spirit, and far from being a disgrace to
wear their caps, in reality it was an
honor and distinction.
