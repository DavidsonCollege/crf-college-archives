Snyderless ’Cats Romp «
As Knowles Buckets 39

Davidsonian Asst. Sports Editor

And then he was gone. Only seven minutes and 20 seconds had elapsed and the
score was a tight 12-11 when the superhorse fouled tiny Henry Carey and trudged
to the bench burdened with three personals.

The ‘Cats had started off this
first venture in NCAA Tourna-
ment play as tight as main-
springs. Rhode Island’s Yankee
Conference Champions, a team
of diminutive race horses had
matched them basket for bas-
ket.

Then it happened. Davidson's
incomparable leader, without
whom the squad of rookies was
supposed to degenerate to a
spineless gang of alleycats, was
on the bench.

The Rams were ready to

pounce. But a rude awakening
awaited them. None other than
Pinky Hatcher. the sure-handed,
never-shoot sixth man. led a
13-4 charge that caught the
Rhodies by surprise and knock-
ed them out of the ball game
for good.

Hatcher, shooting with un-
heard-of abandon, popped in one
long jumper. then, trying an-
other, missed but ‘stole the re-
bound and fired it in from the
corner.

Bobby Lane also became of-
fensive for a change, and took

No Viet Nam Solution

There will always be a to-
morrow in the Viet Nam war.
declared Alexander Gabriel in
chapel Tuesday. Then there will
be two, then three and more Viét
Nams.

Chief United Nations corre-
spondent Gabriel, described as
the “reporter's reporter" and
“unofficial dean and tutor of
young UN correspondents,” said,
in effect, that the U. S. is mere-~
ly batting her head against the
wall in Viet Nam.

“We're not going to solve the
Viet Nam problem,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘The pros and cons are

too even." He added that the! &

fighting could go on forever, un-
til there are more wars to be
fought, and this country cannot
afford, under its present policy,
to pull out of any of them.

Evidently, Gabriel wanted to
get the point across that the pol-
icy needs changing. ‘‘The United
States is using words to fill a
“vacuum of ideas.”

Since World War II, a great
population explosion and new
sovereign states have merged.
The alliances are breaking

down, the Cold War is a myth, |!
he asserted, and today small} ¥

powers are big powers.
‘Nationalism 1s no longer the
dominant theine of these little
wars,” Gabriel emphasized.
“The restlessness is caused by
frustration over the tremendous

gap between the ‘Haves’ and | |

the ‘Have Nots.’”

Thus, the wars of national
liberation are based on eco-
nomics, he concluded, but pol-

icy is not directed toward an|~

economic solution. The foreign
policy of the United States is
atrocious, forcing nations to buy

for the highest prices and sell for
the lowest.

Gabriel added that at pres-
ent, the United Nations is not
equipped to handle the problem
of economics, since it cannot
even get its own members to
pay their dues.

“The realization is that, some-
how, the UN must renew itself
if it is to accept the responsi-
bility of maintaining peace in the
world. The wars of national lib-
eration can only be stopped at
the roots—economically.”

over leadership of the team with
the departure of Snyder. He
threw in a long 30-footer and
then drew raves from the crowd
with driving, twisting lay-ups.

But the star, the man who was
beside himself with hustle and
finesse was Rod Knowles. The
tall sophomore threw in shots
from every conceivable posi-
tion. He started the game firing
from the hinterlands, then
moved inside to crush the piti-
fully-small Rams under the bas-
ket.

Knowles scored 39 points on
15 of 27 from the floor and 9 of
11 from the line. In addition to
collaring 20 rebounds, he dom-
inated the lane in blocking seven
shots.

The big boy made a gallant try
for a 40-point total. After going
to the bench accompanied by a
tremendous ovation from the
partisan Blacksburg, Va. crowd.
Knowles reentered the game in
quest of the magic number. But
Ronnie Stone stole the show with
two amazing underhand shots
and Coach Lefty Driesell retired
Knowles from the game for the
final time.

Meanwhile, Dick Snyder who
scored 11 points despite playing
less than a fourth of the game.
looked forward to the week-end.
saying in all seriousness, “I’m
sure glad that wasn’t my last
game.”

Superhorse, Mates

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Davidson's young Wildcats
raced over and through Rhode

' Island early in the week and

turned toward Raleigh, brim-
ming with confidence. At the

- end of the home stretch the fin-

ishing wire glistens, but Super-

. horse and his stablemates must

first hurdle two stiff obstacles.

Duke, St. Joseph’s, Syracuse
and the Wildcats converge on
Raleigh for games Friday and
Saturday nights. The team which
emerges victorious from this
warfare will continue its quest
for the national championship
next weekend in College Park,
Md.

In the first round Davidson
will square off with Syracuse's
Orangemen, following the Duke-
St. Joseph's tilt. The two win-

| ners scrap Saturday night, hop-

ing to earn a shot at the na-
tional crown.

Syracuse, the next ‘Cat oppon-
ent backed into the Eastern Re-
gionals when the NCAA declared
Pennsylvania ineligible for a
preliminary contest. But the
Syracuse team is rated as the

_ best in the school's history.

Paced by their All-American
Dave Bing, the Orangemen rip-

i ped the cords for $9.9 points

a game on the way to a 21-5
slate.

The slender 6-3 Bing eclipsed
the school scoring record, aver-
aging 29.4 points a game. A
superb leaper, he plays for-
ward as well as guard. His
teammates are 6-6 Rick Dean,

Business
Honorary
Formed

Omicron Delta Epsilon, na-
tional honor society in econom-
ies, has granted a charter to
Davidson and the North Caro-
lina Beta chapter will be form-
ally installed in the near future.

According to Dr. Louise Nel-
son, acting faculty advisor of the
society, the organization’s pur-
pose is to confer distinction for
high scholastic achievement in
economics on college juniors
and seniors.

The society promotes and stim
ulates interest in economic prob-
lems and encourages fellowship
among students and faculty who
share a common interest in eco-
nomic analysis and policy.

The qualifications for admis-
sion are completion of at least
12 hours of economics with a 2.25
grade average and a general
academic average of 2.0.

The following students will be
initiated as charter members:
Bunky Blalock, Eddie Craig,
Ray Fisher, Tiff Harrington,
Johnny Hash, Rick Hodgin and
Bill McGuire.

Also, Jim McNab, Jim Ros-
tan, Tom Simmons, Bill Skinner,
Arnie Snider, Irv Welling and
Pinckney Whitson.

‘Picked As Underdogs

6-4 Vaughn Harper, 6-3 Sam Pen-
ceal and 6-4 Jim Boeheim.

Although they give away
height to Davidson's frontline,
they are all very quick and ex-
ceptional jumpers. George Hick-
er, an outstanding shooter, is the
second leading scorer at 15.7,
although he doesn't start.

The New Yorkers are very
slight favorites, but the unusual-
ly optimistic Lefty Driesell re-
futes this. “There's no reason
why we can’t win it all. Syracuse
has a fine team, but we're going
to Raleigh believing we can
win both games.”

If the ‘Cats conquer Syra-
cuse, they will. meet the Duke-
St. Joseph’s winner. A final con-
test with the Hawks would un-
veil a revenge motive. “They
beat us four points before, but
I think we could win this time,”
Driesell states.

By upending Providence 635-
48 with a stifling zone defense,
the Hawks earned a berth at
Raleigh. They not only received
fine performances from All-
American Matt Guokas and re-
bounder Cliff Anderson, but also
received a tremendous spark
from Tom Duff's 19 points and
11 rebounds. .

The Hawks play tough de-
fense, utilizing the zone press
and man-for-man effectively.
Earlier, in Charlotte, they nip-
ped the ’Cats 83-79.

A Duke-Davidson final would
generate tremendous enthusi-
asm, because of the natural riv-
alry between the two schools.
Sparks would fly, especially in
the frontline where 6-7 Mike
Lewis. 6-7 Bob Riedy and 6-6
Jack ‘Marin would duel with Dick
Snyder, ,Rod Knowles. and Tom
Youngdale.

This is another strong. good-
shooting Blue Devil squad. The
play of Warren Chapman, Ron
Wendelin and others give them a
strong bench. The only com-
parison Vic Bubus, Duke men-
tor, will make between these
second-ranked Devils and_ his
previous crews is to contend that
these are the best rebounders he
has had.

Film Friends Slate
‘Dog Star Man’

Film Friends will show its sec-
ond presentation of the semes-
ter on Tuesday at 8 p.m. in
the Morrison Room of the Union.

The film, Dog Star Man. em-
ploys some new cinemagraphic
techniques. Its director Stan
Brakhage has put together a
masterpiece that has neither
plot nor characterization in the
usual sense. His work has been
compared to James Joyce's
stream of consciousness style.

A short. Werld In Remem-
brance, which is a color presen-
tation of the funeral procession
of Sir Winston Churchill, will be
shown.
