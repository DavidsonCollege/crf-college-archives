A Look at East TENNESSEE

Coach: Ed DeChellis (2nd year, 18-35)
Players to watch: Greg Stephens (6-3, Jr., G, 16.4
ppg, 4.9 rpg, 4.9 apg); Reggie Todd (6-7, Jr., F/C,
13.0 ppg, 8.1 rpg); Kyle Keeton (5-11, Jr., G, 10.5
PPg):
Noting the Bucs: ETSU won two of its last three to
challenge for the third seed in the North Division ...
A 74-65 loss Satur-
day at VMI dropped
the Bucs to the fifth
slot ... Stephens, a
transfer from navy,
is the leading scorer
in the league and
one ofits top overall
talents ... He is a
dangerous shooter, evidenced by his 27-point per-
. formance against Davidson Jan. 19 in Johnson
City, Tenn. ... Against Davidson this year, the Bucs
fell athome 71-58 and Feb, 9 at Davidson, 67-47 ...
ETSU has fallen to the Wildcats in 21 of the 32 all-
time meetings between the two schools ... Davidson
dominated the Bucs in last year’s game at Belk
Arena, winning by 50 points... Having hitsome hard
times since the program's glory years of the late 80s
and early 90s, this year’s team is East Tennessee’s
best in three years ...
of six wins, the Bucs had not won more than three

3.6 rpg); Fernando Daniel (6-2, Jr., G, 7.8 ppg, 3.7 |

apg)
Noting the Eagles: Georgia Southern dropped to
the last spot in the South thanks in part to its 75-58
loss Saturday at Davidson ... Martin paced the
Eagles in the loss to the Wildcats with 13 points on
4-for-11 shooting ... Elvardo Rolle was the only
other GSU player in double
figures, notching 12 ... Mark
Donnelly led Davidson with 15
.. Despite the less than stellar
’ conference mark, the Eagles
‘ cal are a capable squad ... They
4 swept the season series from
South Division titleist and de-
fending conference champion Chattanooga, win-
ning 59-52 Jan. 26 in Statesboro, Ga., and 81-68
last Monday at Chattanooga, Tenn. ... Five Eagles
tallied double figures in points in the latest win over
the Mocs, led by Rolle’s 19 ... Other wins within
Southern play: 61-54 over Furman on Jan. 12 and
65-62 at East Tennessee Feb. 2 ... Some notewor-
thy losses: 82-53 Nov. 21 at Illinois; 96-74 Nov. 25
at Georgia ... While GSU scores a modest 65.6
points a game, its defense has been dismal this
season ... The Eagles are last in the conference in
field goal percentage defense at 48.1 percent ...
Opponents also shoot a league-high 42.1 percent
from three-point land against the Eagles ... GSU is,
however, second to VMI in steals ... Sophomore
Hamp Jones is fourth in swipes per contest with 2.1.

A Look AT APPALACHIAN

Coach: Barbie Breedlove (1st year, 9-16)
Players to watch: Beth Schoolfield (5-11, Jr., F,
16.1 ppg, 6.6 rpg); Tiffany Chappell (5-10, So., F,
8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg); Noel Dolan (5-9, So., G, 8.5 ppg,
71 assists)

Noting the Mountaineers: Other than Schoolfield's
16.1-points-per-game clip, the Mountaineers have
five players who average atleast seven a contest—
Chappell, Dolan, Jamie Gagliano, Natasha
Lettsome, and Rachel Olander ... Gagliano hauls in
7.2 boards a game, Lettsome 6.3 ... The Mountain-
eers, decimated by graduation from last year's

team and preseason injuries, started the year 3-12
... They then won six in a row, moving to 8-4 in the.
league ... Since then, however, the Mountaineers
have struggled, losing the last four games of the
season .,. Appalachian is 5-5 at home, 3-8 on the
road, and 1-2 on a neutral court, 5-3 when leading
at halftime, and 3-12 when trailing at the break ...
The Mountaineers score just 61.2 points a game —
worst in the league — but sport the Southern's
second-best defense ... Schoolfield ranks fourth in
the conference in scoring.
