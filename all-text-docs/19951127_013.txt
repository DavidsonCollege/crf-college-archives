BETYE SAAR FRAMES PERSONAL VISIONS

By Emiry Setina
Staff Writer

Small, with white-grey hair
tinged pink on top and wearing
heavy, .antique-looking earrings,
Betye Saar seems a living repre-
sentation of her eclectic, deeply
personal work. At Davidson to
speak about her current show, Per-
sonal Icons, Saar used words like
“mystical” and “exotic” to describe
the images she creates.

The Los Angeles artist strives
to “empower the ordinary” and to
“create [her] own artifacts” by in-
corporating seemingly unrelated
objects into her small framed col-
lages or “icons.” Saar combines
candles, copper Buddas, scratched
Polaroids of Mediteranean villas,
and even computer chips, visually
linking the ancient and the mod-
ern, the spiritual and the hi-tech.

Saar says that she attempts to

“expand horizons only to condense
them to a box-or frame.” The
intimate scale of Saar’s icons con-
tributes to the sense of the personal
in her work. Drawing on her inter-
ests in tantrist philosophy and the
sacred objects of ancient and Ori-
ental cultures, Saar also finds
beauty and mystery in even the
computer circuit boards she uses
extensively. :

However, it is the one larger
installation in the show, Wings of
Morning, that is Saar’s most obvi-
ously personal expression. Dedi-
cated to the memory of Saar’s
mother, the work is made up of a
low, white altar supporting a blue,
tombstone-shaped backboard.
Hearts and comets swirled into the
sky-colored background surround
a small shelf with blue and white
candles. Bare tree branches frame
the backboard, and an orange and
purple neon glow from behind re-

sembles the light of dawn. Saar
invites viewers to participate in the
work themselves by leaving flow-
ers or mementoes of their own
loved ones on the shrine.

Saar’s appeals to spirituality
and mysticism require an allow-
ance for faith that some viewers
are not willing to make. The visual

and symbolic connections between |

objects are less clear in some works,
and the repetition of size and ob-
jects in many of the icons threatens
to become predictable. However,
Saar’s unexpected uses of materi-
als still manage to surprise the
viewer. Saar’s icons draw the
viewer into their small frames to
discover Saar’s personal visions of
the sacred in both the exotic and
the commonplace.

Personal Icons is on display
in the William H. Van Every Gal-
lery in the VAC through Decem-
ber 20.

Green Vision at the Villa 1994, mixed media

The Sea and Cake soothes the

By Curis MANN
Staff Writer

From little-known Thrill
Jockey Records comes an excep-
tional band called The Sea and
Cake. They create jangly pop mas-
terpieces with each successive al-
bum. Their most recent effort is no
exception. On The Biz , The Sea
and Cake retain their jazz-tinged
rock feel which made 1994’s

Nassau such a delight. The loose,
seemingly effortless guitar-work
brings tomind Pavement, although
The Sea and Cake are without the
absurdities and musical-dada ten-
dencies which permeate
Pavement’s albums.’

“The Kiss” owes a lot to surf-
guitarist extraordinaire Dick Dale,
even inserting a sea breeze effect
in the intro. Most of the other
tracks have similar peaceful, easy

feel to them that won’t let you
down. The vocals, too, are pleas-
ing and cool-sounding, but often
are fairly unintelligible. They bear
a great resemblance to G Love and
Special Sauce-style vocals, laid
back, groovy, and understated.
Tracks five through eight are un-
characteristically dull for The Sea
and Cake, but the last two tunes
pick up the slack. For first-timers,
the all-around: stronger album

ear; Fugazi doesn’t

Nassau gives more bang for the
buck, but The Biz will please even
the most discriminating of palates
as well.

On yet another underrated la-
bel, Dischord, comes Fugazi’s lat-
est, Red Medicine. For provoca-
tive, profound lyrics and an abra-
sive barrage of screeching guitar,
look no further. From the first
song on the album, the listener

_ knows Fugazi takes things seri-_

ously. For seasoned Fugazi listen-
ers, this album broadens Fugazi's
horizons a bit. Two instrumentals
are included on Red Medicine, and
they bring pleasant surprises.
Fugazi old-timers need not fear,
for the aggressive rage and Zeppe-

lin-esque knack for sharp transi-
tions and tempo changes remains.
Fugazi is still extremely political,
and they still seem extremely un-
comfortable in their own skin, giv-
ing their music an air of urgency
and explosive power.

Fugazi owns their own record
label, consistently putting out some
of the most progressive “alterna-
tive” music around. They never
charge more. than $10 for their
CDs or more than $7 for a concert.
That’s integrity. Maybe: corpo-

‘ rate, arena-rockers like Pearl Jam

could learn something from these
four no-nonsense artists. Maybe
then we wouldn’t have to shell out
$30 for a grass pass.

from page 12

I remember, really. Jeni Hankins
was astar—literally. Dragging an
extension cord behind her, she lit
up the stage with an electric star
mounted on her forehead. Other
models that used appliances were
Lylen Ferris and Ryan Harper, who
donned slinkies for the occasion.

Professors Rosemary Lévy
Zumwalt and Janet Shannon car-
ried signs to match their outfits.
Zumwalt, a flower-child at heart,
toted a poster which read “Give
Peace a Chance,” and Shannon’s,
inresponse, read “Gimme a Piece.”
Magdalena Maiz-Peiia and Geor-
gia Ringle went for a more formal
look, dancing around the stage in
sophisticated evening wear. Bill
Giduz decked himself out in Re-
naissance wear, juggled, and truly
played the fool.

The only big-name designer,
Dave Newtant ’94, featured a col-
lection with an animal theme: lots

of fake fur and not much else.
Lexy DeVane and Hiro Iwomoto
prowled around the stage in black
fur and leopard print plastic. Drew
Deyane looked absolutely scrump-
tious in tight tight and short short
black vinyl hotpants and a blue
spandex shirt (I hope to see more
of him).

Debbie Liverman and Jenn
Tracy were also part of the proces-
sion, each wearing little besides
black meshand strategically placed
fur. Tracy especially dropped jaws,
including Hal’s, “Hey Jenn, you
remind me of my toilet seat!” OK,
Hal. Newtant himself left the fur
venue and opted for feathers in-
stead, sprouting a pair of six-foot
wings to match his black leather
pants.

All in all, the fashion show
was ahuge success, drawing a large
crowd and raising over a thousand
dollars to profit the Metrolina AIDS
Project, FLAG Scholarship, and
Habitat for Humanity. Congratu-
lations to coordinators Robert
Knight and Susan Plummer, and
all the models who volunteered for
a, like, totally fab show.
