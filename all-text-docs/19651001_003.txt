HOMECOMING SATURDAY

Modern Folk Singers
To Perform In Concert

The Modern Folk Quartet will
be featured in the Homecoming
Concert on Oct. 23 at 8°15 p.m.
in Chambers Aud?torium.

The quartet uses modern musi-
eal techniques to bring folk
songs up te date. Its fresh ap-
proach, in the quartet's words,
“gives away none of the guts,
drive and excitement inherent
in folk music.”

The quartet's repertoire is
extremely varied, and as one
critic says, ‘Phrases such as
beautiful blend, new sound and
great vigor just barely describe
what the MFQ is doing.”

Cyrus Faryar, a guitarist and
chief spokesman for the group.

was born in Iran. He learned to
play the guitar out of sheer bore-
dom while navigating a yacht
in the Persian Gulf. Ending up
in Honolulu in 1959, he became
the proprietor and sole per-
former of the city’s Green-
sleeve Coffeehouse,
In 1961 Faryar joined Dave
Guard. formerly of the Kingston
Trio, in forming the Whiskey
Hill Singers. After many cross-
ings of the U. S. Faryar re-
turned to Hawali and began ex-
perimenting with some new
ideas, some of which are now
implemented in the MFQ

Tad Diltz, tenor and banjo
player for the quartet, ended up

singing for the West Point Choir
after spending much of his child-
hood and adolescence in Europe
and the Orient. He became
friends with Faryar on a trip to
Hawaii.

Chip Douglas. the baritone.
was raised on a Hawaiian su-
gar plantation. He plays just
about anything that even re-
sembles a musical instrument.

Having already performed and
recorded with The New Christy 9
Minstrels, Les Baxter's Balla-
deers, Travis Edmundson and
The Easy Riders, Jerry Yester
added his banjo and guitar: tal-
ents to the existing threesome to
complete the quartet.

Warren Will Play Lead
In Drama Production

John Warren, a freshman
from Mount Airy, has been
chosen to play the lead in the
drama department's production
of Green Grow the Lilecs which
will be given Freshman Par-
ents’ Weekend, Nov. 11-13.

Mrs. Dave Fagg will play
opposite Warren, and she will
share the dual female lead with
Mrs. Allen Wolf. Supporting
Mrs. Fagg and Mrs. Wolf will
be Miss Pat Whitley. Don
Davis, a senior from. Waynes-
ville, has the part of the vil-

lain.

It is the play upon which the
musical, Okishoma!, was based.
As Rupert Barber, drama di-
rector stated, “It is the story
of a kind of people and their
simple way of life, a life which
disappeared, never to return
again.”

Barber pointed out that the
simplicity of the plot and action
in the play is very deceptive. He
emphasized the great amount
of work that will be required to
develop the richness of the play,
and he was most enthusiastic
about the possibilities which it

and response to the call for try-

freshman class will carry the
majority of the supporting roles.
There are also a number of
smaller women's parts that have
been filled by local volunteers.
Dave Jones, a freshman from
Paolifi, Pa., Blake Anderson, a

Bill Bondurant, director of

Monday about luncheon plans for
Homecoming. An alumni-faculty-
student banquet is scheduled for
noon, Oct. 23.

Tables will be set-in the base

in the adjacent parking lot.
Student tickets at 75 cents per
petson will be sold through the
fraternities and the student
union, Alumni itckets, which
cost $1.50 should be purchased

Bondurant commented, “The
college is subsidizing the ex-
penses for the banquet: it will
be a good chance for students
to meet alumni.”

“This breakfast idea is an
innovation to the Davidson
dance weekend,” remarked
Dan Campbell. chairman of
the Social Council. ‘Most
people are ustally hungry
after partying all night. In
past years, however, there
wasn’t much that could be
done to alleviate their hun-
ger. Having  after-dance
breakfasts this homecoming
seems like a good idea, and
we (the Council) hope that
everyone will take advan-
tage of them.”

"The group of musicians was
formed by rag-piano player Max
Morath*in mid-1964, and played
its debut club engagement at
New York's famous Village Van-
guard. The New York Post
commented on the entertain-
ment: “It is superb, it is bril-
liant. it is heart-stopping, and
it’s fun.”

*Morath and his cohorts are
not only fine musicians and
warm entertainers.”’ said anoth-
er observer," but are innovators.
They’ve seized on a fresh ap-
proach to a wonderful music

' that's been neglected.”

The Quartet performances

‘ combine the music of the turn

of the century within a spoken
framework of modern humor
and satire. Rare and color.
ful stereopticial slides of the
era provide hilarious glances at
the past. Their music ranges

the broad band of true ragtime
styles—cakewalks, classic rags.
syncopated songs and shouts,
in spirited vocal and instru-
mental arrangements that, ac-
cording to one listener, ‘‘reflect
the charm and vitality of the
past, while incorporating the en-
thusiasm and showmanship of
the present.”

' Director of the College Union,
C. Shaw Smith, who has heard
the group in Denver, Lexington,
Pittsburgh and Charlotte, re-
marked. ‘‘Every time they have
been: excellent.”

“They are particularly won-
derful for college audiences,”
Smith continued. “I am delight-
ed that they are coming to
Davidson, and I am especially
pleased at the recognition the
Artist Series has given to rag-
time as an art form by present-
ing Morath’s Quartet.”
