BUDAPEST STRING ORCHESTRA

Davidson Selected For
Part In UCM Program

Davidson College has been chos-
en as one of 22 colleges and univer-
sities to take a part in the Univer-
‘sity Christian Mission, which is
sponsored by the Joint Department
of Evangelism and the Commission
of Christian Higher Education of
the National Council of Churches
and the United States Christian
Council.

This will more than take
place of the Religious Emphasis
weeks which have been conducted
on the campus in past years, Pre-
viously Davidson had one speaker
in Fall and another in the Spring.

the

Instead of this old arrangement, |.

there will be five men to conduct

gles. Consequently, we are plan-
ning to study, to listen, and to dis-
cuss the Christian faith and ethics
as it relates to several distinctive
problems of the South.” These are
the feelings of Sam Magill, the
executive secretary of the. Mission
at Davidson, and leader of the
Y.M.C.A.

Some of the more common ques-
tions asked of the speakers at the
University Christian Missions have
been: “How do you know there is a
God? Is God created by man in
man’s image to satisfy man’s ego?
How can we make our Christian
ideals work in our jobs after grad-
uation?”

conferences with students during
UCM week, which will be February
6-10.

The leaders for UCM week are
to be the Rev. Lester G. McAllister
of the University Christian Church,
Berkeley, California; Dr. Addison
H. Leitch, who is Dean and Pro-
fessor of Theology at the Pitts-
burgh-Xenia Theological Seminary,
Pittsburgh, Pa; Rev. Clark W.
Hunt of the Trinity Methodist
Church in Albany, New York; Dr.
Waldo Beach of Duke Divinity
School; and Colonel Francis P.
Miller of Charlottesville, Va.

Purposes Of Mission

The purpose of the University
Christian Mission at Davidson has
been stated as: “Convinced that the
measure of our faith in God is our
sensitivity and concern for the
world in which we live and that the
extent to which we know Christ
is just that extent to which we look
with His eyes upon all the needs
of men, we propose to: (1) examine
what our response to the love of
God in Christ means, (2) examine
what social imperatives and claims
upon our culture that response in-
volves, and (3) examine what each
of us can do in action as Christians
to transform culture in the name
and nature of Jesus Christ.”

The definite objectives of this
week will be “to present forth-
rightly the Christian faith as the
only real basis for social concern
and action, and to present an ade-
quate interpretation of the re-
sponse of ,Christian faith to the
following social issues: (1) racial
tensions, (2) labor and management
relationships, (3) economic inequal-
ities in the South, (4) organization
of the South, and (5) world citizen-
ship.”

ing chapel exercises.

The Faculty Chapel Committee's
ruling came as a result of study by
faculty and student groups during

| the previous semester and summer

vacation. It was felt that better
programs could be offered by omit-
ting one of the regular required
services cach week.

Dr. Cunningham expressed deep
concern by the administration and
faculty over the apparent student
attitude toward chapel, and he said
steps are being taken for improved
exercises. In return for prompt-
ness and better chapel conduct, the
president pledged a more interest-
ing and better series of programs
this year.

Tuesday chapel will be handled
by a faculty member; Wednesday,
by the college YMCA; Thursday, by
a guest speaker; and Friday, by
student body organizations. The
regular weekday class schedule will
be maintained on Monday.

President Cunningham noted
that chapel services have long been
an institution almost uniquely, on
this campus. He appealed to this
student body, as victims of a more
recent. tradition, to put an end to
undignified chapel behaviour which
disturbs the worshipful and gentle-
manly atmosphere desired by the
majority of students.

In addition to the change in
chapel procedure, he pointed out
that a buzzer will be sounded two
minutes before beginning of the
service. Also, announcements of
concern to all students will again
be permitted at assembly, since
this is realized to be an important
means of intra-campus communica-

| tion.

Dr. Cunningham also announced
that smoking rules in the halls will
be more strictly enforced and that
an endeavor will be made to keep
the bulletin board at the north
door of Chambers up-to-date with
important student announcements.
This is now an official bulletin
board.

Cut cards are no more. The fa-
mous, fabulous weekly missals

from the Dean’s office are gone, ‘cut room.’

for good, replaced by a more ef-
ficient, less troublesome system,
Dean Spencer has announced.

The new system will leave stu-
dent cuts up to the student. Each
man will be responsible for his
own attendance at classes, and will
receive no notice of cuts until he
has stepped over the line into the
overcut realm.

Dean Spencer says that the cut
books will be complete each Wed-
nesday afternoon through the pre-

|vious Sunday, and that any stu-

dents who wish to consult them
may do so on that afternoon and
on Thursday afternoon between the
hours of 2 and 4:30 p. m. Miss
Juanita Morrow will be stationed
in Room 101 Chambers Building

Paul K. Scott, Davidson's Athlet-
ie Director for 4 1-2 years, has re-
signed his post to accept the posi-
tion of Alumni Secretary at his al-|
ma mater, Cornell College. Mr.
Scott is scheduled to resume his
duties at Cornell at Mt. Vernon,
Iowa, on or before October 15.

Mr. Scott is retiring from active
athletic work with his new task of
Alumni Secretary, after serving
faithfully for twenty-five years in
the field of coaching ond physical
training.

Mr. Scott began his career in
sports. Held down by the fresh-
man rule, he was not able to par-
ticipate in varsity sports until his
sophomore year but gained valu-
able training in the basics of foot-
ball and wrestling. For three years
Mr. Scott was an active participant
in varsity football and wrestling;
he culminated his college career as j_
captain of both teams. In 1928 Mr.
Scott was a leading prospect for
the Olympic wrestling team but
was prevented from trying out be-
cause of a sustained rib injury.

Leaving college, Mr. Scott began
coaching in a high school in Orient,
Towa, where he enjoyed 19 con-
secutive victories in football. After
two years he undertook coaching
at a junior college and then re-
turned to another high school in
Missouri. In 1937 Mr. Scott went to
Culver-Stockton College, producing
winning football and basketball
teams for the four years of his

American Chamber Orchestra

On October 19 the American
Chamber Orchestra, under the ba-
ton of Robert Scholz, will play at
Davidson. Founded in 1950, this
ensemble of string and wind play-
ers has thrilled audiences in New
York’s Town Hall as well as
throughout the country with its re-
capturing of our great heritage of
chamber music.

Born and trained in Austria,
Robert Scholz has been acclaimed
as one of the finest orchestral con-
ductors and is a noted authority
on Mozart.

Ogden Nash

Ogden Nash, referred to as the
“poet laurate of the United States”
in Life magazine, is to appear here
‘on the night of October 29. The
comic genius of this rhymster and
maker-of-words has captured the
heart of the publi¢ in his verses in
The Saturday Evening Post and The
New Yorker, on which he served
bricfly as managing editor two dec-
ades ago.

Since Hard Lines was published
in 1931, some dozen volumes of
‘his humorous poems have placed
his name among the greats in con-
temporary American literature. His
ventures into lyricism on Broadway

As a wrestling coach, Mr. Scott
has coached and produced twelve
A.A.U. champions and four N.C.A.
A. champions. It is not to his own
ability that he accredits his coach-
ing success but to the fact that “he
ran into naturally good athietes.”

It is evident that Mr. Scott has
established a splendid record of
achievements during his successful
coaching career. Not only for his
enviable coaching career but also
for the same success that he has
achieved as Athletic Director at Da- |
vidson we want to express our ad-
miration and warm gratitude for a
job well done.

WANT ADS

With next week's issue The Da-
vidsonian will introduce a ‘want
ad’ column for use by the students
and administration in advertising
any articles which they would like
to sell. The column, which will find
its place on the back page of the
paper, will be supervised by the
various editors in order that it
might gain (through the words used
in its adds) some sort of human in-
terest.

Members of the college family
are urged to place ads in the Da-
vidsonian box in Chambers or in
the Union, or by mailing them to
The Davidsonian, Box 218, David-
son, North Carolina. Costs for all
went-eds will be 50 cents for 35

having consulted the cut books are
requested to fill out cards provid-
ed. Their cases may then be clear-

Dean Spencer indicated upon
consultation that the new system is

that though he feels that it will be
a decided improvement over the
previous system, it is still open to
criticism and suggestions. Students
are asked to present any improve-

and she has written a large number

prestige to one of America's great-

Budapest String Quartet

February fourth brings to Da-
vidson one of the most renowned
exponents of the exacting art of
chamber music — the Budapest .
String Quartet. The history of the
string quartet goes back to the
18th century to Haydn, and since
then quartet playing has become
one of the greatest enjoyments and
one of the most exacting roles of
the string players.

The Budapest artists have been
applauded not only in their large
number of performances in this
country and Europe, but around
the globe in Australia, North Af-
rica, and Japan. Each year the
group highlights the chamber mu-
sic season at the Library of Con-
gress in Washington, and since its
birth in 1930 they have won the
acelaim of the world's critics for
their artistic integrity, sound mu-
sicianship, and brilliance of execu-
tion.

Dublin Players

The Dublin Players, appearing
here on the night of February 25
and on the afternoon of the fol-
lowing day in three one-act plays.
has been called ... “one of the
foremost acting companies of our
time," by Eddie Dowling, Broad-
way producer-actor. Last year the
players made their first-coast-to-
coast tour of the United States,
coming from the famous Abbey
and Gate theatres of Ireland. This
season they have returned on an
even more ambitious tour. Perform-
ing with the great skill and style
that characterizes those two classic
theatres, they bring new meaning
and a fresh approach to.the great
plays of G. B. Shaw, Wilde, Noel
Coward, Sean O’Casey, W. B. Yeats,
J. M. Synge, Lady Gregory, and
others. Critics have been extrava-
gant in their reception of these
Irish and English actors; “the fin-
est Company to come here in 20
years” says television tycoon Ed
Sullivan.

Burl ives

A descendant of Illinois farmers,
river-boat gamblers and preachers,
Burl Ives has come to be known
as the nation’s leading folk-singer.
While still in rompers, he learned
the songs of the plains, the moun-
tains and the sea from his grand-
mother, who had crossed America
in a covered wagon. He will be
heard at Davidson on March 25 at
the apex of his story-book career.

musical called “The Boys from
