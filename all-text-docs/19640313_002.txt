it. is my. conviction that it is
morally wrong to discriminate
against any person on the ground
of race. I do not deny that every
man has a personal right to
choose whom he wishes to asso-
ciate with, but when this per
sonal preference is made the
custom of the area. whether it
be done by legal means or by
social pressure, it automatically
limits the freedom of both Ne-
groes and whites to associate
with whomever they choose.

The other day it was necessary
for me to schedule an interracial
dinner meeting. The difficulty I
had finding a restaurant which
would serve us was a ‘limitation
upon. my freedom. I can only
imagine how. it. must..feel to a
Negro who finds himself each
day excluded from facilities
open to white members of our
society. To me this is treating
the Negro as less than a human
being.

1 also believe that the federal
government has the right to im-
pose a Jaw against discrimina-

modation. I am sure there are
sincere people who honestly op-
pose this bill because they re-
gard it.as a violation of prop.
erty. rights.

To me the issue is between
property rights and human

rights, and { unashamedly
choose the cause of human
rights.

It seems to me that the federal
government has the right to
intervene in local situations
where human rights are being
denied. There would, of course.
be no need-for such intervention
if the local authorities preserved
the rights of. all citizens. But
when this is not done, as it
clearly -has not. been done, the
federal government ‘must act. to
assure the full rights of citizen-
ship for all people: This must,
of course. be accomplished by
constitutional means.

The basis for Title II seems
to be the concept of a ‘‘business
affected with the public inter
est'’ and the interstate com-
merce clause of the Constitu-
tion. It has been.the right of
government to regulate and con-

trol the use to which “‘business
affected with the public inter-
est’ can be put at least since
the famous case De Portibus
Maris decided in the British
courts in the seventeenth cen-
tury.

The kinds of businesses held
fo be “affected with the pub-
lic interest’’ have been in-
creasingly extended and de-
finitely specified. 4 is my
opinion that all those busi-
nesses included in Title I!
have been held to be so af-
fected.

The meaning of interstate
commerce as uséd in the Con-
stitution has also been widely
extended by Supreme Court de.
cisions and today includes the
types of businesses mentioned
in Title If. It would seem, there
fore, that the authors of the dill
have been careful to include only
those businesses which have
been held by the courts to be
public and to be included in in-
terstate commerce. Whether or
not they’ have gone beyond the
present meaning of interstate
commerce must be determined
by the Supreme Court.

The March: An Endorsement

Joe Howell has come .under consi-
derable personal pressure this past
week to call off tomorrow’s civil rights
march. The pressure has come _ not
from the Davidson College adminis-
tration, but from certain sources in
Charlotte, and from such unlikely per-
sons as the parents of friends, who
have “broken relations” with him be-
cause of his role in the march.

On other campuses, pressure from
college. administrators has cut down
the number of marchers to the extent
that Howell would have had an honor-
able out yesterday on television by
blasting the pressure sources and call-
ing off the march.

Howell didn’t take the out, not be-
cause he is particularly looking for-
ward to the march, but because he is
an unusual fellow who happens to
believe strongly in what he is doing.
We are also proud to note that in sev-
eral instances he has received badly-
needed moral support from some pro-
fessors here who have also expressed
a willingness to join the march in sup-
port of the civil rights bill.

For those who have criticized Howell
for “marching rather than trying to
effect positive programs to help the
Negro cause’’: since Howell took over
as YMCA President, that organization
has begun a Negro Tutorial Program,
has expanded a Negro recreational
program, has organized visits by Dav-
idson students to Negro schools, and
has actively encouraged student par-
ticipation in areas such as voter reg-
istration. YMCA members have also
been active on the Davidson Civil
Rights Committee in planning con-
crete steps toward bettering the lot
of Negroes in this community.

The Charlotte Observer could have
saved themselves an editorial this
morning if they had done a little home-
work of their own on the reasons for
the march, as set down at length by
Howell on several occasions.

Howell has repeatedly emphasized
the fact that participation in the march
does not necessarily imply support of
the entire civil rights bill as it now
reads.

The only belief which is shared by
all the marchers is that strong civil
cights legislation should be passed by
Congress as soon as possible.

As for the possibility of violence,
the best way to find trouble is to look
for it, and Charlotte Mayor Stan
Brookshire has been doing some look-
ing.

The Charlotte Police Department
had the right idea when its spokesman

stated that he anticipated no trouble
for a peaceful demonstration. How-
ever, Brookshire keeps mentioning
violence, and the more he says about
it the better the chances of trouble
oecurring become.

We admire Joe Howell for his will-
ingness to stand by what he believes
despite heavy pressure and criticism,
and we endorse the Charlotte march
as a valid means of expressing support
for the civil rights bill.

We often wonder whether white
Southerners really are acting in their
own best interests by opposing the
civil rights bill.

The civil rights movement in this
country has been focusing for months
on the civil rights legislation now be-
fore Congress, and if that legislation
does not go through, Negroes may
Start looking elsewhere for solutions
to their problems. For an example of
which way they may turn, try the
Black Muslims.

The publicity surrounding Cassius
Clay’s joining the Black Muslims has
shocked some people into realizing
that American Negroes aren’t going to
stand for being deprived of their law-
ful rights forever.

The Black Muslims are a direct out-
growth of frustration, and Clay once
said that his reasons for joining the
Muslims amount to this: he doesn’t
intend to force himself on anyone,
and if the white man doesn’t care for
his company, he doesn’t particularly
care for the white man's.

So instead of touring Africa as a
good-will ambassador for the United
States, Clay goes to represent an or-
ganization which is dedicated to the
concept of Black Supremacy!

Many Davidson students who are
willing to actively support the Ameri-
can Negro’s drive for full civil rights
will join Joe Howell in the Charlotte
march tomorrow.

For those who may wish to express
their views under different circum-
stances, Paul Simpson is planning a
two-way panel discussion of the entire
question of civil rights. The discussion
will begin at 10 p.m. next Thursday
in the Union.

There are proposals in other
titles of the currently projected
legislation which would, for |ex-
ample. deny local election
boards due process of law if any
allegation is made against them:
and which would allow those
who administer school desegre-
gation to exercise their personal

Negroes reside. Such proposals
do not serve justice. in my opin-
ion. However, with suitable. cor-

ination in. elections and educa-

Rights Law Will Protect
Voting, Job Opportunities

Ed. note: This past Monday the Senate opened debate on H.R. 7152, the House-
approved omnibus civil rights package. For those who have supported the bill or railed
against it in total ignorance of its provisions, we offer the following summary of the
measure’s 11 sections. The summary was prepared by J. Francis Pohlhaus,. counsel
for the Washington bureau of the National Association for the Advancement of Color-

ed People.

Title I: Voting

The title seeks to further pro-
tection of voting rights.

In any Federal election it.

would prohibit (1) the applica-
tion of different tests, standards,
etc. and (2) denial of registra-
tion for immaterial errors in
applications. It would require
all literacy tests to be given in
writing or to be transcribed.

It would require expeditious
handling of cases filed under the
1957 and 1960 Civil Rights Acts,
and to that end would authorize
the Attorney General or a de-
fendant to ask trial by a three
judge court, with direct. appeal
to the Supreme Court. In any
such proceeding it establishes
a presumption of literacy for
those who have completed the
sixth grade. The right of the de.
fendant to request a three judge
court was added by amendment.

Title tl:
Public Accommodations

Title II prohibits discrimina
tion in places of public accom.
modation as defined in the bill.
It would cover most hotels.
motels and other places of lodg
ing: restaurants, cafeterias and
other eating places: motion pic-
ture houses, theaters. sports
arenas, stadiums and other
places of entertainment and
athletic performance: gasoline
stations: and other establish-
ments located in. or containing.
a covered establishment—such
as speciality shops in hotels or
stores with eating facilities.

The individual aggrieved or
the Attorney General would be
able to enforce rights under the
title through injunctions or
other civil actions.

Title Ul: Desegregation of
Public Facilities

This title would allow the At-
torney General to initiate or
intervene in cases seeking deseg-
regation of public facilities own-
ed, operated or managed by
public authority, where the in.
jured party is unable to pursue
the remedy.

It would also authorize the
Attorney General to intervene
in cases already filed by in-

2)

dividuals seeking relief from
denial of equal protection of the
law because of race, creed,
color, or national origin.

Title IV:
School Desegregation

Title ITV would authorize the
Attorney General to initiate or
intervene in school desegrega-
tion. cases if the injured parties
are unable to pursue legal reme-
dies. It would also provide tech-
nical assistance, grants. and
training institutes to help in the
desegregalion process.

By amendment the House add-
ed a definition that desegrega-
tion would not include trans-
porting students to end racial
imbalances.

Title V:
Commission On Civil Rights

Under this title, the Commis-
sion on Civil Rights was extend-
ed four years and given addi-
tional duties to investigate vote
fraud cases and to serve as a
national clearing house on civil
rights. Under the bill as report-
ed by. committee, the Commis-
sion would have been made a
permanent agency. The House
weakened this title of the bill.

Title Vi: Nondiscrimination
In Federally Assisted
Programs

This title prohibits discrimina-
tion in any program or activity
receiving Federal’ assistance
under grant, contract, or loan.
It directs Federal agencies to
establish programs of compli-
ance and would authorize denial
of funds to those that discrimin-
ate. Any denial of funds would
be subject to judicial review.

By amendments the House
guaranteed a hearing before a
fund cut-off. It also required
Presidential approval and a re-
port to Congress before funds
could be denied.

Title Vil: Equal Employment
Opportunity “FEPC”

Under Title VII employers,
labor unions, and employment
agencies whose activities affect
interstate commerce would be

prohibited from discriminating
in employment policies and prac-
tices. Coverage would include
employers and unions ‘with
twenty-five or more employees

‘or members. The number would

begin with 100 or more and drop
by stages to 25 after four years.

An Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission would be
established to investigate and
voluntarily settle complaints.
Upon failure to settle, it would
be authorized to file suits in
Federal courts to enforce non-
discrimination.

The House extended the type
of discrimination prohibited to
include sex, as well as race,
creed, color, or national origin.
It excluded from coverage those
denied employment rights be-
cause they are atheists or Com-
munists.

Title Vill: Voting Statistics

This title provides for a voting
census by race in areas desig-
nated by the Commission on
Civil Rights.

Title 1X: Remand

Title IX would authorize ap-
peals in certain civil rights cases
that are transfered to Federal
courts from state courts, then
remanded to the state courts.
Under present law there is no
appeal when the Federal Dis-
trict Court sends these cases
back to the state courts.

Title V: Conciliation Service

This title was inserted in the
bill on the House floor, after
having been deletéd in commit-
tee. It. would establish in the
Department of Commerce a
Community Relations Service
with a limited personnel of six
persons.

Title Xi: Financing and
Miscellaneous

The last title contains the
miscellaneous provisions author-
izing appropriations, protecting
existing rights and providing a
“separability clause’’ — which
states that if any part is held
invalid the rest of the act shall
not be affected.

regulation as to whom one must (or must not) accommo-

will probably achieve legislative
compromise, that an advocate of
any civil rights law should sup-
port the whole package (which-
ever variation reaches the floor
first). This would give practical
leverage. In the first place. this
is litle more than speculation:
in the second, such maneuvering
in the Senate is more likely to
be successful if the major pub-
lic sentiment urges deletion of
unwanted particulars, than if
such sentiment demands _ that
extreme measures be adopted.
Let the Senate's factions work
out the compromise tactics with
the knowledge of what the public
truthfully wants.

There has been considerable
discussion as to whether a fed-
eral ‘‘public ‘accommodations”’
law would violate the U. S. Con-
stitution. One can find the judg-
ment of Senator Ervin (D. N.C.)
on this point in the Congression-
al Record (June 24 and Dec. 10.
1963).

Ironically, this section of
the bitl is being justified by
some on the basis, of Constitu-
tional. provisions specifically
those relating to equality be-
fore the law and interstate
commerce.

I would concede that the
usurpation of private property
rights by the federal government
does not violate the 14th amend-
ment or the power to regulate
interstate commerce. The Mth
amendment does not, however,
(as yet!) authorize Congress to
regulate private selection of

business clientele in the name of
equality. It seems a rather
cynical manipulation of the inter
state commerce clause to
authorize this same federal in
tervention just because a motef
may use soap or sheets or T.V.
sets manufactured in another
state. What institution is then
free from this wedge? Will each
state have to manufacture every
household product. wedding
dresses, textbooks for private
schools, Bibles, etc. in order to
protect folks from such a Con-
stitution?

The greatest irony is that the
U. S. Supreme Court cannot
really be relied upon to rule
this Act unconstitutional, even
though a previous Supreme
Court did just that with an ear.
lier version. The personnel of
the Court is not the same and
many decisions have shown that
precedent is only a temporary
factor, and that ‘“‘the Constitu-
tion is what the Courts say it is.”

Whether or not it is unconsti-
tutional in the view of the Court,
which does not always accept
the Constitutional provision that
those powers not specifically
granted to the federal govern-
ment reside with the States, it
may still be argued that the in-
trusion of the federal govern-
ment into business operations
which are entirely within the
bounds of a state (or city) is a
serious reduction of personal
liberty. Therefore, it is neces.
sary that the Senate be urged to
delete this section of the bill.

Dear Editor:

In last week's DAVIDSONIAN
there appeared a reproduction of
an anonymous post-card  ad-
dressed to Joe Howell's father
concerning Joe's alleged involve-
ment in an incident in which
several Negro girls attended
worship with the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian congregation
in the company of some students
at the college. The fact that Joe
was not even present at the
service compounds this repre-
hensible attack, to say nothing
of the ‘dating’ charge based on
an initial impression without
investigation. My concern in
writing this letter, however, has
to do with other implications of
‘this unfortunate bit of corre-
spondence.

Lest the “poison pen spat-
fers ink’ on the College
Church, t wish to make clear
that, while the penman may
be a member of this church,
his attitude and action do not
express the official position of
the church with regards the
general issue of the partici-
pation of non-Caucasians in
the church’s corporate life.

The Session of this church,
which is its governing court
composed of the congregation's
elected representatives, has con-
clusively concurred and clearly
stated that anyone who wishes
to worship with us is welcome to
do so. Moreover. I would add
that there can be no test of
race or motive applied to pros-
pective participants for them to
qualify as worshipers of the
God who was in Christ and
whose love is limitless. The Col-
lege Church is not ‘‘our church.”
It is the Lord’s. and as such its
members and its minister do not
have the right to exclude anyone
included in the unconditioned in-
vitation and welcome of Christ,
the Head of the Church.

The penman who wrote that
post-card did indeed fill his
quill with the poison of angry
alienation. However, it is my
hope and prayer that we in the
church shall so fulfill our God-
given mission of reconciliation
as not only to supply an antidote
for such poisonous animosity.
but also to substitute for its
lethal invective the expression
of Christian love.

Tolerance is all right toward

you are much too sophisticated
to think that your faith could
enable you to be healed; so. of

Dear Editor:

In response to a misunder-
standing which has arisen con-
cerning the letter I wrote to
the DAVIDSONIAN last week.
I would like to clarify my
thoughts. The purpose of my
letter was to express concern
over the number of young facul-
ty members who have left Dav-
idson during the last four years.
For this reason I listed a num-
ber of young men who have left
and are leaving this year.

I did not intend to imply that
all these men left because of
conflict with the administration.
Oniy seven of the fifteen men
left as a result of such conflict.
These seven are Dr. Lord, Dr.
Goodykoontz, Dr. Staples, Mr.
Horton, Professor Miller, Dr.
Tilly, and Dr. Tucker.

I do feel, however, that the
departure of these men is cause
for serious concern on the part
of students, faculty, and admin-
istration,
