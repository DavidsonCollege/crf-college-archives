The Davidson men’s soccer
team’s season came to a smashing
halt Sunday afternoon on a cold
playing field in Bowling Green,
Ohio..

Playing in extremely coldcon-
ditions, Bowling Green beat the
Wildcats 3-1 in an NCAA tourna-
» ment play-in game.

With temperatures at the start

of the game hovering below 30 and
the wind swirling at 10-15 mph,
the Falcons froze Davidson’s of-
fense, limiting the Wildcats to only
three shots. And just one of thos

Football ends

losing

streak

season

Davidson and Bridgewater
entered Saturday’s sopping season
finale with hopes of ending losing
streaks of eight and 23 games, re-
spectively.

FOOTBALL

As the game turned out, both
concluded their skids of futility
without even collecting a win, as
an anticlimactic 7-7 stalemate
served as a disappointing finish to
a disappointing season.

Pounding, incessant rain and
gusting wind transformed
Richardson Field into a virtually
unplayable quagmire. The sloppy
turf impeded both squads’ offen-
sive attacks, and each unit could
only produce a single touchdown.

Bridgewater (0-9-1) compiled
91 yards on the ground and 56
through the air for a meager sum of
147, while Davidson (1-8-1) fared
only slightly better, netting 87 rush-
ing and 96 passing for a total of
183. The two teams combined for
more punts (17) than first downs
(15).

Bridgewater took advantage
of a John Blake fumble to strike
first, as Eagles quarterback Chad
Rowland lofted a 16-yard touch-
down toss to split end Mickey
Hamilton in the left corner of the

end zone 31 seconds before inter-
mission. A Michael Padgett extra ,
point gave winless Bridgewater a
rare 7-0 lead at halftime.

' Davidsonresponded relatively
quickly with seven minutes 35 sec-
onds remaining in the third quarter
when freshman quarterback Clif
Henry found a gaping hole in the
Bridgewater defense and sloshed
his way 48 yards to the water-
logged promise land. Dunn
Mileham’s kick-after tied the game
for good. °

“J just turned it up and got a
great block from Pete Perri and
took it into the endzone,” Henry
said.

But that would be the end of
the limited scoring in the soggy
contest that marked the epilogue
of the magnificent careers of se-
nior captains James Cassidy, Bo
Bartholomew and Will Robinson.

Dominant defensive lineman
Cassidy finished an 11.5-sack sea-
son and a 24-sack career, includ-
ing a 12-tackle, one-sack perfor-
mance on Saturday.

Bartholomew, like Cassidy,
added 12 takedowns and a sack,
while Robinson contributed 11.

“We’re disappointed over-
all with how the season went, but
we had eight great seniors play-
ing,” said Robinson, who lead the
team in interceptions. “We had
some down moments this year, but
they have a lot of talent here, more
talent than they’ve ever had, and
the best coaching staff I’ve ever
been around. And with that kind of

Joe Burch scored twice for
Bowling Green’ after the 70th
minute. Dave Kind tallied the Fal-
cons first goal in the first half.

The Falcons clearly had an
advantage playing in the condi-
tions, which included some snow
around the field.

“We dug a deep, deep hole,”
Wildcats coach Charlie Slagle said.
“We had the wind in the first half.
I’ve been working real hard to get
the kids to adjust to this kind of

climate and the wind. We prac-
ticed (early) Friday morning be-
fore we left and then practiced
yesterday in the wind.

“My big worry was that we
were going to come out and try to
adjust to the elements and just go
through the motions .in the first
half and we did. I’m glad it was
only 1-0. The kids. came back and
played well in the second half. But
BG played a great 90 minutes. They
have a lot of stars.”

The Wildcats (12-11-1)

beating Furman. 1-0:the’ previous

season, was silenced, noteventak-

combination, I wish I could be here
for a couple more years.”

Added coach Tim Landis,
“We’ve got some maturing to do
and we need to get bigger and
stronger in the offseason in the
weight room and we need to con-
tinue to develop our minds and our
intensity towards the game.”

With this type of offseason
regimen and a strong recruiting
class like this year’s, Davidson
football seems pointed in the right
direction. And hopefully these pro-

-cedures will be rewarded with more

wins next fall.
As Robinson conducted his
last interview in Davidson’s red

and black, he said, “Twenty years
from now, we may not remember
the wins and losses. We want to
win, but what’s important is the
kind of hard work and effort we
gave each other, and the fact that,
on this team, we’ve got 72 guys
who’ve always got each other’s
backs.”

Women’s basketball begins season with victory

By Krisy Forp
Staff Writer

Women’s basketball started
out with a bang this season, defeat-
ing Fort Bragg 83-64 Sunday in
the team's first scrimmage of the
year.

With a number of different

combinations and substitutions,.

scoring was evenly dispersed
among many players.

Freshmen Kerry and Jamie
Brown dominated play in their first
college appearances. Freshman

Jessica Montrella,. despite foul
trouble, made an impressive ap-
pearance as well.

WOMEN’S

BASKETBALL

The team has been practicing
since Oct. 15 and has been led by
four seniors who are expected to
be quite visible this season. Kristen
Ferrucci ended the season last year
third in the country and first in the

conference in field goal percent-
age. She has been selected pre-
season all-conference. Molly
Burke has worked on her game and
is expected to be more of an out-
side threat this season.

Tonya Sharpe and Maggie
Young continue to be three-point
threats.

Depth will be one of the Wild-
cats weapons this season. The
team has several juniors and sopho-
mores with college playing experi-
ence.

Carolyn Kirsch was also se-

lected preseason all-conference and
with her strength inside should help
out greatly inrebounding. Monica
Winter and Elizabeth DuBose will
continue to split time at the point
guard position.

Amy Scalcucci was the most
consistent three-point shooter last

season and is expected to be a

continued outside threat. Daniele
Mall continues to be highly versa-
tile because she can play both in-
side and out.

Both Jenny Vanlerberghe and
Jennifer Sandborne have come

back stronger and in better shape.
Sophomore Carrie Sloan and fresh-
man Nora Kaizer walked on this
season and are expected to add
quality relief time. Montrella and
the Brown twins are versatile in
that they can all play three posi-
tions and can be moved around to
suit the opponent.

The team has rough schedule
early on including tournaments in
California and Pittsburgh.

Their first game is Nov. 24
and they start conference play on
Jan. 4 at Furman.
