ANTHONY ABBOTT PORES OVER PROOF
Book Is “Reaffirmation Of Christien Principles”

ABOUT SHAW

Abbott Publishes Book

By JOE SAUNDERS
Dévidsoniaen Feature Writer

Dr. Anthony S. Abbott,
assistant professor of Eng-
lish at Davidson, has re-
cently published a signifi-
cant work, Shaw and Chris-
tianity.

The book is a study of George
Bernard Shaw as a serious re-
ligious critic, written for the
general public, In his book,
Dr. Abbott attempts to show
Shaw's attitudes toward Chris-
tianity in a clearer light.

The book is divided into two
parts. Part One, “The Proph-
et,”” attempts to show the sub-
stance of Shaw's ideas, while
Part Two, “The Playwright",
deals with his presentation of
these ideas on stage.

According to Dr. Abbott.
“The true vocation of a prophet
is not. as is popularly sup-
posed, to foretell future events,
but to reveal the ‘truth about
the present.” Shaw, by his
criticism of Christianity and his
own theology of Creative Evolu-

tion, was trying to point out the
defects in modern society.

Even his style of writing is
“in the tradition of the great
prophets.’’ He shows life as it is,
and makes the reader under-
stand what must be done to im-
prove it.

In his comments on the jacket
of Dr. Abbott's book, Edmund
Fuller says, “Shew and Chris-
tlanity is a solid fresh contribu-
tion . . . of special value to
those interested in the tension
between classical Christian doc-
trine and modern secular
thought. It offers penetrating
readings of Shaw's works.”

Eric Bently, a professor at
Columbia University, states “It

New Student Committee
Organizes For Seminar

By MASON STEPHENSON
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A committee, inspired by Rob-
ert Theobald's visit, has been
organized to aid in the prepara-
tion of students for the tech-
nological world by means of
reading and discussion.

According to the coordinator
George Williams, the local com-
mittee, whose members include
Chuck. Matthews, Murray Smith,
Bill Wiseman, Pete Bondanella,
Bill Council, Ken Childs, Jay
Federman, Jack Martens, and
Bill Trotter, is part of an in-
tercollegiate group which will
have a beginning membership of
approximately 25 schools from
throughout the country.

Each of the college commit-
tees will be responsible for mak-
ing contributions to the national
organization. Davidson's com-
mittee is responsible for the
bibliography which is due on
Dec. 15.

Williams said that the biblio-
graphy will concern “the world
in which we live right now.” It
will be a short bibliography with
only about 20 books from several
fields: economics, psychology,
sociology, politics, education,
novels, short stories, and science
fiction.

“It is not our main point to
consider Theobald’s idea of a
guaranteed income,” Williams

said, “‘but some of us like it.”
The group is mainly concerned
with the relationship between
the individual! and the technologi-
cal society. More specifically
they will concern themselves
with the university society and
the “outside” world, and with
the university and its students.

According to Williams, the
committee is composed of peo-
ple who are interested in making
Davidson a somewhat different
place, and Theobald's visit pro:
vided for their organization.

Those who are interested in
an eating house, those interested
in constructive criticism of the
campus and those interested in
bringing better films to the cam.
pus are somewhat connected
with this committee's work.

The committee is interested in
the discussion of problems and
educating the student for a mod-
ern society. ‘We are denying
that the past was producing the
kind of education needed in the
future.”’ Williams stated.

Williams said that it is not
exclusive in membership and
that the program has gotten
started. The aim is to have
each interested organization on
campus have at least one pro-
gram on the problems with

ed. ‘‘We want to have continuing
discussion and activity of all
kind,"’ Williams added. ‘‘Discus-
sion usually flares up for a
while here and then dies down.”
