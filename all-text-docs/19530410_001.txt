Dorm Counseling Re-introduced As Dr. George D. Heaton Sets Theme
r

By CHARLES HASSELL

Dorm counseling will be re-in-

troduced for spring services as Dr.
George D. Heaton, of Charlotte,
sets the theme for the semi annual
services which begin Sunday spon-
sored by the YMCA.
. Dr. George D. Heaton, pastor
of the Myers Park Baptist Church
and one of the most widely sought
Christian speakers in the South,
will be the principal speaker for
the annual Spring Services which
begin with the vesper service on
Sunday and extend through the
chapel period Wednesday.

The theme for this year’s Spring
Services will center around “The
Social Ethics of the Christian,”
supplementing last fall’s stress on
the personal ethics led by the late
Dr. W. M. Thompson. Thus the
year’s emphasis on Christian ethics
will be complete.

A native of Louisville, Kentucky,
Dr. Heaton received his formal
training at Denison University in
Granville, Ohio, and the Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary at
Louisville. In addition to the de-
grees of AB and ThM received

TWO DAY DRIVE
YIELDS 403 PINTS
FOR RED CROSS

By HUNTER STRADER

Once again the Davidson student
body has answered a call that
never ceases to be of prime im
portance to our nation as a whole.

On Thursday and Friday of this
week the Mecklenburg County Mo-
bile Blood Unit was set up in John-
ston Gymnasium to receive donors
both from the student body and
from the community itself, and as
usual the call was answered.

On Thursday 213 persons troop-
ed in to give their pint of blood
to save a life in Korea, and up
until 5:15 Friday afternoon a total
of 403 contributions had been
made. Davidson has achieved the
notable honor of standing second
in the nation among the colleges
and universities for blood contribu:
tions.

The rating is based on the per-
centage of the student body contri-
buting. St. John’s University of
Brooklyn is the only institution of
this nature commanding a better
record than Davidson College.

As in most previous blood drives
the campaign has been lead by 8
member of the student body. This
present drive has been diverted
by Larry Dagenhart of the senior
class. The details of signing up for
donations has again been handled
very successfully through the social
fraternities, with several of the
Greeks promising 100% response.

Several groups of students were
unable to contribute at the present
time. Among those were several
of the athletic teams which have
heavy schedules now. Also the
junior R.O.T.C. classes were un-
able to make donations due to re-
cently receiving shots for summer
camp. Dagenhart and Col. Davis
both expressed the hope that these

Ray Anthony To Play Next Week;
Frolics’ Concert Set For Saturday

The big Spring Frolics week-
end is only a week off now,
and excitement on that event
is running high.

Last-minute dates are being got-
ten, big plans are being formulated,
and everyone is generally looking
forward to the appearance for the
first time of Ray Anthony's famous
band.

Perhaps more than ever before,
the concert is bringing much at-
tention for again as during Mid-
Winters, it will be held in the
auditorium at 3:30 on Saturday
afternoon.

The program for the afternoon
is especially fine for a college au-
dience and will include “Slaughter
on Tenth Avenue” and the ever-
popular “When the Saints Go
Marching In”. Next week in The
Davidsonien the complete program
will be printed.

As far as the rest of the dances,
they will follow the same pattern
as Mid-Winters with the formal

won valuable graduate scholar-
ships. The General Education
Board has announced that they
will receive scholarships for one
year to any graduate school in th
country.

The awards, established by Jobn
D. Rockefeller, pay not only the
recipients’ tuitions, fees, and travel
expenses, but also stipends of $125
per month for nine months.

Brinkley plans to enter graduate
work this coming year at Colum:

also applied for a Fulbright Award,
has not yet chosen his graduate
school.

Also on the program will be the
famous “Skyliners” and the An-
thony Choir in addition to the 19-
piece band.

The theme of the dance will be
that of a “Bunny Hop”, which
should fit in well with Ray An-
thony since he began the craze of
the “hop” several years ago in
colleges all over the country. Last

theme to its greatest effect, but
