The Typical Student—

Many, many times we have heard the ex-
pression, “He's a typical Davidson student.”
Have you ever thought what the typical Da-
vidson is like, what his chief characteristics,
chief hobbies, chief faults are. What sort
of an impression does he make on the out-
sider? Let's consider ourselves on the out-
side looking in and see what we can see.

He is usually rather young, younger than
the average college student. Dresses very
carelessly,. sometimes for effect, sometimes
for fun, sometimes because he doesn’t have
anything better. Nearly always carries a book
or more, and nine times out of ten he’ll be
twirling a key chain around his finger.

If you break in on a “bull session,” chances
are you'll find him talking about his girl, his
home, or athletics. He sprinkles in much
profanity, just to show that he is now a man.
If the night is warm, the bull-session may end
up in a water fight. He'll probably go to bed
thinking how hard he studied and wondering
why he didn’t accomplish more.

If you seé him at an athletic contest, chances
are he won't make much noise, unless it’s to
boo George Glamack or some other mortal en-
emy. If you see,him at a dance, he’ll either be
giving a very sorry exhibition of jitterburg or
complaining because the music is too fast.

“Real Education—

Fifty years ago students couldn't get to
Charlotte in half an hour; as a matter of fact,
they could hardly get there at all. So week-
end after weekend they were forced to find en-
tertainment—and pleasure too, believe it or
not—on a campus that offered nothing in com-
parison to our modern facilities. Nothing, that

could ever prove this point more clearly than

may like to believe, you and I, and our profes-

ready to offer a warm and cordial welcome to
us all; there are still home-made chocolate

SOME COMMENTS ON THE
GRAPEVINE (BY A FEMALE
GHAPEL HILLIAN):

This column carried several weeks
ago a discussion ‘of the grapevine
system of communication connect-
ing all girls’ schools.

This Week is presented some fem-
inineideas.on the subject by a co-
ed at Chapel Hill.
follows: °

“~.. [thought I might be justi-
fied in offering a few comments on
the column on a few points on which
you were, in my feminine opinion,
slightly confused.

You said a large amount of infor-
mation is passed along by girls by
means of the postal system; but,
you did not mention this: the largest
amount is passed along in person:

Since a test of friendship among
girls is the degree of pleasure one
girl gets in telling another that she
has “dope” to the effect that she
is being snaked on or handed the
old double cross, the more friends
a girl has the more she will learn
about the diversions of those who
proclaim interest in her.

Anytime two girls from different
schools get together, as much in-
formation is exchanged as when
Hitler and Mussolini have a chat

One item. which men for some
unknown reason seem to overlook is
the fact that every week in the fra-
ternity news, a column widely read,
appear the accounts of the recre-
ations. participated in over the
week-end by the “brothers.” Q

instance, can read that her faithful

was not doing Boy Scout work or
having his tonsils removed.

The gossip column does not af-
ford a large amount of information,
because of its subtilty and because
its lingo is practically unintelligible
to the feminine reader

If a boy dates a girl-in a girls’
school, it is safe to say that 90 per
cent of the girls on her dormitory
floor knows about it when it hap-
pens, 50 per cent of the school
knows when a girl goes steady, and
80 per cent knows when a girl is
pinned up.

past

If a boy dates two or more girls
in the same school, he thereby au-
tomatically becomes a topic of con
versation for the entire school as
everyone is waiting to see who will
be the winner. However, only a
foolish few try this as it seems to be
a manly instinct to know better.

Girls discuss mainly who is dating

nally the conjecturing as’ to which,
if any, he is really interested in

It is only the girl in love who
falls for a line and that is because
she wants to, even though she
knows better. Of course you can
fool anybody for a while, but, as
you said, not for long.

Naturally there are always a few
dopes who. will believe any line
shot them, but any man who will
shoot such an

innocent victim is

ly cruel and should be annihilated
