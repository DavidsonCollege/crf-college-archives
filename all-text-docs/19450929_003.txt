— "CAT CHAT

By Sterling Edwards

Football started off with a bang this season when
Coach Shepherd called a practice the opening day of school.
Many new boys were at the first turnout, but over half
the team has had previous training under Shepherd through
summer practice. As most of you know the summer prac-
tice, Was the first of its kind, and it proved very helpful
to coach because he has so many new boys this fall.

Shepherd used the first week of practice to perfect
blocking and tackling, but he has put these past two weeks
to good use in many hard workouts of actual scrimmage.

Judging from the past few drills the Wildcats are
developing into a promising squad, and will be well pre-
pared to meet Darlington on October 13. ,

I{ any of you should happen to wander down to the
-practice—field—frenr4—_to-6—0’clock—some—afternoon,—it’s
certain that you will notice some of the outstanding grid-
ders such as Bill McLean or Bob Millar taking part in
scrimmage drills. Bill is a veteran on the gird team, and
is holding his own on the right side of the line in the guard
spot. Being one of the most experienced men on the team,
he helped coach the linemen during the summer session
while Shepherd would take the backfield. Millar is in the
pivot position in the line, and is handling it nicely it seems.
He has been slowed up some this past week by a slight
thumb injury which he received in activities other than
“the game. mentioned. T he backfield spotlight is focused
on Ward Lasley. You'll find Ward to be one of the fastest
ball-carriers we have. He also calls the signals from his
fullback position. Keep your eyes on Ward when we play
Darlington, He'll be doing his share for the ’Cats.

We boast a fairly heavy line this year with an aver-
age of approximately 180 pounds, with the lightest man
being 165 pounds. The back field runs a little lighter with

an average of about 165 pounds the lightest man being
-158 pounds,

- Since there are so many boys out this year, Shepherd
will be assisted in his coaching by Art Roach and Jim
Sample, both prewar ballplayers on the Wildcat team.
They excelled in backfield play, and are a great asset to
the new ball carriers this year.Art, who was an outstanding
punter, is giving some of backfield men the Roach Magic
Toe Formula. No kidding, our kickers are improving.

Sample has, been working with the line for the past two’

weeks with good results.

Injuries temporarily laid out Joe Richert and Pete
Sinclair in the earlier days of practice, but they are both
back out this week. Richeért’s hand injury may keep him
out of rough work ‘for a few days. Incidentally, that hand
wound was received from friend Millar, and vice-versa.
They are roommates, you see.__/

Since football is the sport of the day, Coach Whittle
has drawn up an intra-mural schedule, which is to begin
this week. This will include all fraternities together with
a well chosen independent team. Well chosen just means
that eveybody can’t play. The K A and Kappa Sigs were
the champs of last year, but it’s anybody’s win this time
with all these new freshmen sporting high school letters.

What did you think of the Duke-South Carolina
runaway last week? Aren’t we glad we're just a fresh-
man team. Clemson didn’t do so bad either when it ran
up a 76-0 score over P. C. Let us hope our Wildcats make
such an underdog of Darlington.

sent school year. The teams com-

that the Phi Delts, Pikas, Pi Kaps,
Betas, and Independents will field

ut least one team a piece. The other
fraternities will combine in some
way in order to put out a six or

This is a definite improvement
over the last few years when the
league found itself with five teams.
Everyone looks forward to a fine
intra-mural program under the di-
