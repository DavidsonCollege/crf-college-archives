DR. CR HARDING

‘Davidson Greek Professor Talks
On Man’s Intellectual Capacity

The regular weekly Davidson College
half-hour took the air at 8 o'clock on
last Thursday evening, with Announcer
“Skip” Brown at the microphone to
greet his widespread audience with the
customary “good evening.” Featured on
the program were Kenneth Scott, organ-
ist; Mrs. Norton Pritchett, vocalist, and
Dr. Caleb Richard Harding, speaker.

The opening selection was an organ
rendition of “Indian Lament,” by
D'vorak. Kenneth Scott, of the sopho-
more class, played this composition on
the three-manual Skinner. Next Mrs.
Pritchett was introduced, this being her
first broadcast since she participated in
the Christmas vesper service last year.
She sang the familiar “Bells of St.
Mary's,” accompanied on the organ by
Mr. Scott.

Following this solo, Mr. Brown intro-
duced Dr. Harding as a man who has
made a study of life art, and
who knows man as few men do. Dr.
Harding, now in his forty-seventh year
as a member of the Davidson College
faculty, and professor of Appreciation
of Art, then gave a brief and interest-
ing talk on man as an intellectual entity.

Upon the conclusion of this address,
Kenneth Scott turned to the works of
Fritz Kreisler, offering that composer's
beautiful “Caprice Viennois” as an organ
solo. Mr. Scott then accompanied Mrs.
Pritchett as she sang “Roses of Picardy,”
following which he concluded the pro-
gram with the number, “The Old Re-
frain,” this also by Fritz Kreisler.

This just left Mr. Brown the time
necessary to once more identify the
source of the program, and to invite his
audience to return to their loudspeakers
at 8 o'clock tomorrow night for another
Davidson College half-hour.

earth, moon, and sun all contribute to
its apparent change in form.

The sun is 857,000 miles in diameter,
and if reduced to a hollow shell, with
the earth placed in the center, it could
easily contain both earth and moon.
At this point Dr. Harding called at-
tention to the stars. He mentioned the
origin of their names in classic mythol-
ogy. Then he continued with a discus-
sion of their more interesting features,
giving a detailed explanation of the
movement and composition of that con-
stellation known as the Big Dipper.
The distance to the stars is, to the
lay mind, almost incredible. The light
from Sirius, the Dog Star, requires nine
years to reach the earth, and light trav-
els at a speed of 186,000 miles per sec-
ond. Only seven of the stars have at
present had their diameters measured.
But the diameter of all of them is much
larger than that of our sun. Our sun
is nothing but the star of our own solar
system.

All stars are in motion, it was pointed
out, and the sun is moving in a straight
line as are the rest of them. Eventually
the constellations will change their pres-
ent shape.

Among the slides were several close-
up photographs of spiral nebulus. These,
the speaker explained, are other uni-
verses. With them the lecture was con-
cluded.

Although Dr. Harding took his doc-
tor's degree in mathematics, and he is
primarily concerned with the teaching
of that subject, he has made astronomy
his hobby. In the past three years he
has conducted a syndicated column on
popular astronomy.

the night of April 9. Speakers from
the college will be sent to most of these
local gatherings. Last year over 400
Davidson alumni gathered at the Found-
er’s Day meeting.

Davidson’s first Founder's Day was
held last year with Dr. Ben E. Geer,
president of Furman University, mak-
ing the principal address. Two years
from now the céntennial of the found-
ing of the college will be celebrated.

as concrete. It takes about five miles’
run for the Bluebird to reach its maxi-
mum and a gradual diminishing of speed
for tive more miles before it can stop.

The racer is guided by a white canvas
square, apparently about 25 feet square,
suspended at each end of the course.
Before the race a string is sighted be-
tween the two points and with that as
a guide, a stripe about eighteen inches
wide of black oil is painted. The string
is, of course, removed.

The motors of the mighty Bluebird,
the boys learned from the local authori-
ties on the sands, are cooled by.icewater
before each run and the various gears
(the popular guides differed between
four and five in numbers) can be shift-
ed only after certain speeds are attained.

Four days later, after the beach was
in. good condition and the Bluebird had
been repaired, Campbell succeeded in
breaking his speed record of 272 miles
an by a little more than three
miles per hour.

ment made by Dr. Edward Mack, dean

inory who have shown scholastic ability.

sity debating team, solicitor for The Da-
vidsonian, treasurer of the Y. M. C. A,
and secretary-treasurer of his junior
class, and president of his senior class.

of our home games seem like a Barium
Springs Day, when they show up in
time to lend their support to the team.

The high point of the day. was the
game between the Reds and Greys,
which was the final game of a series
which has been going on during the
spring practice. The teams were evenly
matched, resulting in a scoreless tie. A
crowd estimated at more than five hun-
dred turned out to watch the last game
of the winter drills, scheduled especially
for the Barium Springs Day.

Between the halves two teams from
the orphanage staged an exhibition
game, Henry Pittman, younger brother
of Paul Pittman, was star of the game,
making a 55-yard run, after having
taken off his shoes for greater freedom.
Later he scored again, his side winning
12-6.

Members of the student body were
given a chance to contribute to a fund
for the orphanage, and tickets were sold
to all others. The total amount raised
was about sixty dollars,

letic Association, vice-president and
president of the Student Body, and
president of his sophomore class. He

returned to Davidson in the fall of 1930
to serve as Y secretary.
Mr. McKinnon will continue his stud-

ies at the University of Edinburgh,
Scotland. Mr. Pritchett will remain at

Union Theological Seminary.

Chesterfields satisfy: because, first of all,
they’re made of the right kinds of mild ripe

whatever it costs in time or money we do
