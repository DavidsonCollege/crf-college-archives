Alcohol Week’s events warn against excess

ALEX OBREGON
Staff Writer

Swimming, movies, sobriety
tests and simulated car accidents
are a few of the many events that
will be taking place during the next
few days, as the campus recognizes
Alcohol Awareness Week.

In conjunction with many or-
ganizations oncampus, Health Edu-
cator Georgia Ringle coordinated
the week of events with the theme
“Lollanobooza” to “get people to
think about their drinking, espe-
cially drinking and driving,” says
Ringle.

In the past, Alcohol Aware-
ness week has been held in October
when it is recognized nationally.

This year, however, because
there was achange in the position of
Alcohol and Drug counselor and
Health Educator, ajob formerly held
by Art Flagg, the week was planned
to take place in spring semester

instead.

One of the advantages of hav-
ing Alcohol Awareness week in
February, according to Ringle, is
that the events would get students
to start thinking about drinking as
they prepare for spring break.

The campus and community
organizations involved include:
Residence Life, Dean of Students
office, Campus Security, Dining

Services, SHOC, the Theater de-

partment, the Union Board, the Ath-
letics department, Patterson Court
Council, North Mecklenburg Med-
ics, and the Davidson Volunteer
Fire department.

Highlighting the week’s events
are sobriety tests, “Sex, Violence

and a Six Pack,” and a wrecked car

displayed on the Union Patio.
The sobriety test will take place
Monday night at Vail Commons.
Two Davidson students will be
taking part in the demonstration:
one will be served beer and the

other liquor until they are both in-
toxicated.

A member of the North Caro-
lina State Patrol will then conduct
the test normally given to individu-
als who are pull over for driving
under the influence.

Free ice cream sundaes will be
served for those who wish to attend
the demonstration.

“Sex, Violence, and a Six
Pack” is a series of skits written and
performed by Davidson students
which paint “realistic pictures of a
party night on campus,” Ringle
says.

Atthe end of the performances,
they audience is welcome to par-
ticipate in a discussion.

This event, happening Tues-
day night, will be held in the 900
Room.

“The Jaws of Life” exhibition
promises to be one of the most
exciting of the week’s events

The Davidson Volunteer Fire

Department and the North
Mecklenburg Medics will demon-
strate the procedures followed fora
car accident. .

This will include extracting a
body from an actual wrecked car
that will be brought to the Union
Patio on Thursday.

Ringle is very pleased with the
campus-wide effort to bring these
events to campus. According toher,
the goal of Alcohol Awareness week
is “to bring the issue of alcohol to
the forefront, to show thatit is some-
thing we can talk about.”

She emphasizes that alcohol
consumption is something that
should be discussed. She also rec-
ognizes that it is a difficult issue to
deal with because of the mixed popu-

‘lation on campus of legal and un-

der-age students. |

She hopes that the students do
not feel as if they are being preached
to, but will have fun and take advan-
tage of all of the events.

“You will make better decisions if two bodies look at [the proposals].”

overrode the ATC council in decid-
ing this. Now we have almost $3000
that could go to a lot of other orga-
nizations,” Burk said that day.

That night, however, he met
with the Senate Executive Commit-
tee of the SGA and together they
decided that the increase was nec-
essary for the SGA.

The ATC, the student-led com-
mittee that allocates funds to all
independent campus organizations,
is acommittee of the SGA. Before
the SGA vote last month, the SGA
had asked for funds in the same
manner as all other organizations—
by submitting a budget to the ATC
for approval. After the ATC ap-
proves a budget, the entire list of
allocations is submitted back to the

SGA for approval.

According to former SGA
President Warren Buford and former
ATC ‘Chair Rebekah Peeples, the
proposal for an automatic 5% of
funding was passed by the SGA in
order to solidify the link between
the two bodies and eliminate the
awkward situation of each SGA
approving its own budget.

Union Board Director William
Brown. who sits on the ATC. feels
thatthe strange relationship between
the ATC andthe SGA has notcaused
major problems in the past. “I know
of no time when the SGA tried to
vote down the budget that was pre-
sented to them by the ATC.”

Peeples says that the intent is
good, but the process should be
reviewed. “The SGA wants to fund
a rides program—that’s great. I
don’t think that the SGA is trying to
pad their resources. They were just
trying to give themselves enough
money for future projects. They use
[the money] well. It’s just problem-

atic that they did this with no real . ©

check. You will make better deci-

sions if you have two bodies look-

ing at [the proposals].”
Discussing the automatic 5%

plan, Brown feels that “it would
have been better if the SGA had had
this reviewed by the ATC.”

Even though the plan remains °

the same, Burk plans-to do this. “I
want to see what the ATC recom-
mends. They need to look at every-
thing because that’s their job.”
Senior Class Senator Sarah
Terry feels that the increase is war-
ranted. “The [automatic 5%] isn't

Tong’s book
explores
feminist
approaches to
bioethics

By JENNIFER STARR
Staff Writer

In her recently published book
Feminist Approaches to Bioethics,
Dr. Rosemarie Tong explores femi-
nist bioethics and the need for femi-
nists to build consensus.

Tong describes feminist bioet-
hics as “attentive to issues of gen-
der so that women don’t get ne-
glected and so that a fuller perspec-
tive of the issues will be presented
in ethical analysis. Overall ethics
focus on allowing people to be as
free as possible and experience the
least possible harm.”

are the only organization on cam-
pus who is made up of the entire
student body and plans activities
that at some point target and in-
clude all facets of campus. And if
that many people object to it, then it
is interesting that their arguments
weren't raised earlier when we
passed it.”

Peeples hopes that the money

is used responsibly. “One hundred
dollars may not mean a lot to the
SGA, but it would mean a lot to
Amnesty International or SERCH
or FLAG.”
“This will be a trial year,” says
Burk. “If the rides program is a big
flop, then we won't need [the in-
crease]. This is a good year to try
it.”

sity in feminist bioethical view-
points enriches discussion, but
should not prevent feminists from
arriving at consensus.

“You try to figure out which
policy, with all its implications, is
going to benefit the most possible
women. You can’t benefit all
women—that’s impossible—but
this shouldn’t prevent seeking the
best possible thing for the most pos-
sible women,” Tong says. |

In Part One of her book, Tong
critiques the different feminist ap-
proaches to ethics and discusses
how they relate to nonfeminist ethi-
cal approaches. .

She suggests that the two pri-
mary types of feminist ethics—the
ethics of care, which focus on vir-
tues such as nurturing and compas-
sion traditionally associated with
women and the ethics of power,
which focus on working toward
gender-equity and eliminating
things which promote a patriarchal
society— reinterpret traditional
ethical approaches with an empha-
sis on including women’s perspec-
tives, interests, modes of moral rea-
soning, and the cultural values tra-
ditionally associated with women.
She also discusses the substantial
differences among the various femi-
nist ethics.

In the second half of her book,
Tong describes how feminist ethics
approach issues of procreation such
as contraception and sterilization,
abortion, artificial insemination,
surrogacy, and genetic screening.

She shows how various femi-
nist ethics differ from nonfeminist
ethics and from each other on these
issues. She also details the com-
plexity of feminist ethics and bioet-
hical issues. — i
