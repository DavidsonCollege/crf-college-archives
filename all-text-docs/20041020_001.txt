Trustees propose allowing non-Christians on Board

Committee recommends changes to college
Statement of Purpose, Trustee Bylaws

By Davip Crow
Editor-in-Chief

On October 8, the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee of the Board of Trustees unani-
mously recommended to the entire
Board changes to both the College’s
Statement of Purpose and the Trustee
Bylaws. The recommended changes
would modify the Trustee religion re-
quirement, allowing up to 20 percent
of the board to be composed of non-
Christian members.

Currently, the Trustee Bylaws state
‘all persons elected as Trustees shall
be active members of a Christian
church.”

Under the proposed changes, the
new Bylaws would read, “Histori-
cally, persons elected as Trustees
have been active members of a Chris-
tian church. In order to preserve the
religious heritage of Davidson Col-
lege and in openness to and respect
for the world’s various religious tra-
ditions; at all times at least eighty
percent of the elected voting mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees shall be
active members of a Christian
church.”

The process of the change

This recommendation marks a
departure from the Board’s previous
position that they had no intention of
changing the religion requirement for
Trustees.

The last time the Christian require-
ment was formally brought up with
the Trustees was in 1996 when they

discussed the possibility of remov-
ing or modifying the Christian re-
quirement for those members of the
Board elected by the Alumni Asso-
ciation. However, after deliberations
the Board voted to maintain the re-
quirement for Trustees.

The issue of the requirements did
not officially come up again with the
Trustees until last year, when the
Board decided the topic of their an-
nual retreat would explore “What it
means to be achurch-related college
in the Reformed Tradition.”

“Last February we decided that the
issue was current enough and we had
a Board that had never engaged this
particular topic so we decided to
chose to examine this topic,” said
President Vagt.

While the focus of the retreat was
not specifically to discuss the Chris-
tian requirement, the retreat did al-
lowed the Trustees to explore the
meaning of the Reformed Tradition
in greater detail.

“The combination of presentations
and extended small-group discussion
at the retreat was the first opportu-
nity in a long time for the Board as a
whole to engage this important con-
cept,” said Vagt.

Other Trustees also found the re-
treat helpful.

Rev. John Rogers 63, a member
of the Ad Hoc Committee said, “The
conversation that came out of that
retreat was very helpful. I had some
questions about it [the requirement]

The Residence Life Office, Health
Services, Building Services and Ath-

force to contain and prevent the
spread of a particular strain of bacte-

phylococcus Aureus (MRSA).

After several hours of restless sleep
on a concrete sidewalk lining an in-
ner-city strip mall, Adam
Gerstenmier ’05 woke up before
sunrise in search of food.

“We had to be up by 6 a.m. so that
we would not be forced away by
security guards and so that we could
getin line ata soup kitchen for break-
fast,” said Gerstenmier, recounting
his fall break experience.

Gerstenmier and eight other
Davidson students, carrying only the
clothes on their backs, blankets for
warmth, cardboard signs and emer-
gency identification information,

reported and were treated for the
bacterial infection in the fall of 2003.

Despite a seemingly low number
of affected students, administrators
are taking every precaution.

“It’s obviously contagious, and
you can die from it,” said Leslie
Marsicano, Director of Residence
Life (RLO) and Associate Dean of
Students.

“We don’t want people to panic,
but we want people to be wise.”

roamed the streets of Washington,
DC over fall break, experiencing

‘homelessness firsthand.

The 48-hour “Urban Plunge,” a
program run through the National
Coalition for the Homeless [NCH],
was one of four Alternative Break
Trips sponsored by Davidson’s com-
munity service organization, United
Community Action [UCA].

The D.C. trip was unique in that
the participants did not directly per-
form community service.

“Tt was a program to simulate the
homelessness experience in Wash-
ington, DC to help raise our aware-
ness of what homeless people go
through,” Gerstenmier said. “Our
increased understanding may help us

Most cases of MRSA can be “re-
solved within about 10 days” with
certain antibiotics, according to Dr.
Craig White. In rare cases, though,
MRSA enters the blood stream and
could be fatal. White is one of two
part-time Student Health physicians
at Davidson.

RLO issued a health alert through
email two weeks ago, warning stu-
dents about the. bacteria. Staphylo-

life and better advocate for their
needs.”

According to NCH’s “Urban
Plunge Manual,” the definition of an
Urban Plunge is an experience in
which “economically-privileged
people dress down, empty their wal-
lets, and spend time on the streets as
““poor’ people.”

To mentally prepare for the Urban
Plunge, the group met four times to
learn about the demands they would
be facing on the street. They dis-
cussed their fears, reservations, hesi-
tations and built acommunity within
