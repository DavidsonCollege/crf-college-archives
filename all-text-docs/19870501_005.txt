Extreme Prejudice serves up oldspaghetti Western

By BURT PARKS
Extreme Prejudice
What has Louis L’Amour got
that the script writer for Extreme
Prejudice hasn’t? Talent, for one
thing. Though the script writer at-

tempts to bring the romance of the °

Texas Ranger to the big screen in
blatant imitation of L’Amour, he
uses sO, many tired cliches that
- even ol’ Louis would groan. The
writer, like a revelation, must
have theorized that reworking old
cliches with new faces adds a
hitherto unexplored dimension for
fans of Western movies. The audi-

Perhaps the producers thought
that the allusions and associations
with those other films and book
would raise this movie to their
level, maybe as the pinnacle of the
cliche pile.

The Texas Rangers of modern

still behave as the Texas Rangers
of yore. They toss shotguns to
their partners when the need
arises. When their woman leaves
them, or when their partner dies in
a shootout, they hold a square
countenance and walk stoically
away. They uphold the law at any
cost, including friendship. Their
actions reveal what words, like

just sit and drink with a Ranger be-
cause they are “particular ‘bout
who I drink with.” Some subjects
remain of the heart'rather than the
‘head. Characters who try to
analyze have no sympathy what-
ever from Rangers.

The other group who plays a
role in this film, the military, es-
‘pouses a sense of instant justice
and fair play, muchas the Texas
lawmen do. They realize that to
capture criminals one must some-
times act like criminals. They
work undercover beyond the law,

with its Miranda warnings and
rights of the accused, to pass sen-
tence on known criminals. Only
their work rewards them, and they
perform it with inspiration. Yet
only the Texas Ranger, standing
tall in his boots and stetson hat, re-
sists the lust for power and lucre to
which the others succumb. Right
up to the final Mexican standoff
he remains loyal to his country
and true to himself, a silent hero
slowly sinking into the sunset.

economically, politically, and
militarily. But we ought to have
an open mind, and when we see
some of these things such as we
are just seeing here in the initiative
with respect to intermediate-range
weapons, we ought to carefully
and cautiously move forward. Ina
cautious way, we ought to watch
and when we see them taking
steps towards us, we ought to be
prepared to take a step towards
them.

On the proposed U.S.-Soviet

agreement to eliminate
medium-range nuclear missiles
from Europe: |

I believe that we will me an
agreement with the Soviets on in-
termediate-range missiles. I think
that as a result of the discussions
which were recently held when
Secretary of State George Shultz
was in the Soviet Union that in

principle we have reached suffi-
cient agreement to indicate that
we have a basis for an agreement.
The problem now is going to be to
work out the details between now
and then. I, myself, am of the be-
lief that we will work those’ out.
And Ff think this will be a very
good thing for us and the world
community. —
_ On the U.S.-Japanese trade
imbalance: —

The basic problem on the trade
deficit is that neither side, neither
us nor the Japanese, has been wil-

ling to take the steps necessary to

move us forward. By that I mean
on the United States side, we are
going to have to do something to
really address our budget deficit,
because that affects in a very, very
substantial way what happens to
the trade deficit.Secondly, we are

going to have to become more -

competitive. We have become

flabby, we are not competitive,
and we are going to have to be-
come more competitive.

On the other side, in terms of
structural changes, the Japanese
must open up their markets. They
have dragged their feet on this,
and it has to be done. In addition
to that. they have to take other
steps to stimulate domestic de-
mand. And again, they haven’t
moved on that.

On the future of the Middle
East: 5
The only way that ’tensions in
the Middle East will be turned
around is for a new international
conference to be called, and at that

include Palestinians as well as the

other countries that would be in-+
volved in such a discussion. I do
not see much likelihood of that
happening between now and 1988
because this gets caught up in the

electoral process. But, it is going
to have to be done again, and I
think it will be done. But it’s
going to take political will on the
part of the United States, because
-without the United States acting as
the catylyst, nothing in my judg-
ment is going to move it forward.

On Central America:

My own view on Central
America is that the only solution
that will be a lasting solution is a
political solution. And therefore I

think it ought to be something.

along the lines of what the Central
American nations have been talk-
ing about themselves. We have to
make sure that any such agree-
ment is a verifiable agreement,
which keeps out for the future any
foreign troops or equipment. I
think this can be possible if we
participate actively in the discus-
sions.

- On the future of southern Af-

rica:

I think that the South African
crisis is going to become more and
more bloodier as time’ goes on,
and I just don’t know when it’s
going to be resolved. In the mean-
time it’s going to be a tragedy for
white and black alike. I think that
a problem we ought to be addres-
sing is the problem of a safety net
for the frontline states — Bots-
wana, and the other countries ad-
jacent to it. Those countries, be-
cause of the transportation sys-
tem, are really almost totally con-
trolled by South Africa, because
that transportation system exits
now only in the ports of South Af-
rica. Somehow, we ought to be
thinking ‘about what is it we are
going to do to help those countries
which are really going to be very
squeezed at this point, if their abil-
ity to exit their goods to the sea is_

stopped.
