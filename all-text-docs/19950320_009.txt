THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS _ ,

MONDAY, si ar 20, 1995 9

This time when she calls, her
voice is hollow. You search for
some substance to the conversa-
tion, but she does not respond.
You struggle with the space of
grey air that seems to be envelop-
ing the lines because she is your
sister, your best friend, or your ex-

girlfriend, and you cannot stand

this silence.

This time when you ask her if
she has been seeing anyone, she
stalls. You come to understand
that this pause is the very cause of
the silence, andachillruns through
you. And suddenly, the silence is
drenched with sobs and you lose
yourself in her anguish.

It seems he never forced her.
He never heard her “no” because
she never said it. She never said

Silence

her “no” because she never ex-
pected anything. Atthis point, you
can’t tell if she was drunk, or if he
was drunk, or if they were both
sober, but deep down inside you
know that fact is not what matters.
So, you try to calm her, too many
miles away to be of any real help.
You whisper that it is okay know-
ing very well that itis not. You tell
her that you are sorry, so very, very
sorry, knowing that truth does not
help. You scream that you want to
hurt him the way he has hurt her,
but you know deep down that he
does not deserve the full blame.

And so eventually, you calm your
mind and tame your soul. You quit
trying so hard to search for an
enemy to bear the brunt of your
sadness and her pain. The enemy,
it seems, was the silence that en-
veloped their night.

This time when the women
you know talk about their dates,
you remind them to set their lim-
its—whatever those limits might
betothem. You remind them to let
those limits be heard. Let their
“yes” mean “yes” and their “no”
mean “no” so that no one else, man
or woman, may be the victim of

their. ambiguity down the road.

This time when the men you
know talk about their dates, you
remind them to ask; silence may
sometimes insinuate fear rather
than approval. You remind them
that they too can set their limits.
You remind them that silence can
also be destructive.

This time when she calls, she
is better. Her voice sounds stron-
ger and relieved. She has spoken
to him, she tells you. And while it
was aconversation that should have
taken place long ago, before her
fear and pain could ever be real-

ized, she is comforted by the lines
of communication that are now
open.

It seems that he never forced
her and that she never said no. It
was not wrong, but it was not right.
She hated the result but never in-
terrupted the proceedings. He re-
spected who she was but never
asked what she wanted. She knew
what she expected but never
thought about what might happen.
He wanted to please her but didn’t
know toask. She was afraid to find
her voice and unable to hold her
tears. The lesson they learned was
not worth the pain. The need to
communicate moves beyond the
classroom. They ended up better.
The next time she calls won’t be
the result of the silence.

"Twas not

I recently had the pleasure of
seeing Disclosure, starring Michael
Douglas and Demi Moore. I found
it to be very interesting. The film
deals with an incident where a fe-
male employee sexually harasses
her male co-worker. This situation
was very intriguing to me because,
although such things inevitably
occur in this age of career women,
whenever we think of sexual ha-
rassment, we pretty much always
assume the man is the perpetrator.

This got me to thinking. What
other acts are women just as guilty
as men, but never receive any
blame? One example readily
popped into mind—pooting. When
someone passes gas in a room of
mixed company, some poor guy
always gets blamed. We all have
the same digestive systems, but for

some reason girls have managed to
trick everybody into forgetting that
fact. In doing so they have dumped
the blame for their share of bad air
onto us guys. An experience I had
in class last week in class made me
realize that this double standard
has to end,

It all started in my English

. literature class. I was sitting in my

customary desk in the back of the
classroom listening to the profes-
sor drone on and on about
Shakespeare. All of a sudden an
odor hit my nose like a freight train
Something may have been rotten
in the state of Denmark, but it
couldn’t compare to this smell. I
suspected that the guilty party was
the petite blond girl who shared the
back row with me, and my suspi-
cions were confirmed when an
empty bean burrito wrapper rolled

out of her book bag as she searched
for a pen.

All of a sudden I noticed that
almost the entire class was looking
back at me with a disgusted look
on their face. Me! Even the petite
blond girl looked at me and pinched
her nose. The professor put down
his Shakespeare long enough to
subtly open the window while
shooting me an evil glance. But it
wasn’t even my fault!

I’mlikethe PLO of farts; when

somebody detonates a bomb they
don’t want to claim, they say I did
it. Guys are unfortunately on the
short end of the stick in situations
like this. What would Shakespeare
say if he were me? Hmmmm.
Hark! Is that.a female from which
yonder wind breaks? It is indeed,
for Iam not the one!

Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
The evolution debate continues

Before Spring Break The
Davidsonian printed an article by
Eric Sapp entitled “Evolution: the
elaborate lie” (The Davidsonian,
Feb. 13). Sapp made one notewor-
thy. point; the theory of evolution
“is taught simply because no better
[theory concerning the develop-
ment of life] can be found.” Too
often, scientific theory is blindly
accepted as immutable fact. A
good theory must (a) accurately
describe a large class of observa-
tions on the basis of a model that
contains only a few arbitrary ele-
ments, and (b) make definite pre-
dictions about the results of future
observations. Evolution fits both

criteria; it is a good theory, not an -

“elaborate lie.” My agreement with
Sapp’s thoughts on evolution stops
where his pseudoscientific argu-
ments against the theory begin.
Sapp states that evolutionary
theory’s claim that less complex
organisms gave rise to more com-
plex organisms violates the second
law of thermodynamics. How-
ever, biological systems build more
complex material from less com-
plex material every day, just as
bricks (less complex things) make
up the Chambers building (a more
complex thing). Heat, useless dis-

ordered energy, is a byproduct of
all these actions and reactions.

Building complex biological sys-
tems does. not violate the second
law of thermodynamics because
the organisms are islands of order
in a rising sea of entropy.

Sapp points out that the Law
of Biogenesis (all life comes from
life) seems to contradict spontane-
ous generation (life originates in
the absence of life). The Law of
Biogenesis by itself creates thelogi-
cal problem of an infinite regress.
If chickens come from eggs and
eggs come from chickens, then it
seems like chickens and eggs must
exist infinitely in a backward di-
rection. This would imply that
chickens have been around longer
than the universe! No matter how
hard I try, [cannot picture the “pre-
universe” with no time, no space .
. . just chickens. The chicken had
to start somewhere, but where?
Presently, life, and only life, gen-
erates life, but simple organic mol-
ecules are believed to have formed
in a primordial ooze about 3.5 mil-
lion years ago. These organic
molecules synthesized with oth-
ers, and life began. Life cannot
spontaneously generate now be-
cause simple organic molecules

become food for 1 more complex
organisms. An experiment by
Stanley Miller in the 1950’s, in-
volving synthesis of organic com-
pounds, provides evidence for this
theory of life’s origin.

Sapp claims, “there is no evi-
dence connecting different types
of organisms to each other.” But
biogeography, the fossil record,
comparative anatomy, comparative
embryology, and molecular biol-
ogy provide overwhelming evi-
dence for evolution. Volumes
could be written on these topics
alone. I will not attempt to cover
them all in one newspaper column,
but I will try to hit the highlights.

The fossil record is rich with
transitory organisms. Paleontolo-
gists digging in Egypt recently dis-
covered an extinct whale with hind
limbs, linking whales to a terres-
trial ancestor. Evolutionary theory
predicts that whales were once ter-
restrial, but their large size made
terrestrial locomotion difficult.
Natural selection favored whales
that spent more time in the water,
and eventually the species became
aquatic. Natural selection favored
‘whales with shorter and shorter
hind limbs, since larger once im-
pede swimming. Modern whales

have mere skeletal remnants of
hind limbs that do not extend from
the body. Paleontologists continu-
ally turn up undiscovered links
between modern and ancestral spe-
cies. Simply because a link has not
been discovered does not disprove
its existence.

Sapp Cites the lack of a link
from dinosaurs to mammals as
evidence against evolution. But
there cannot be a link between
dinosaurs and modern mammals
for a good reason. Dinosaurs be-
came extinct! No new life form
can be derived from an extinct
species. Dinosaurs and mammals
had branched from a common an-
cestor before becoming dinosaurs
and mammals.

In addition to fossils, molecu-
lar biology supports the theory of
evolution. The genetic code is
passed through DNA from parent
to offspring, and DNA codes for
proteins. Just as siblings have more
similar DNA and proteins than
unrelated individuals, closely re-
lated species also have similar
DNA and proteins. Organisms
that appear closely related through
fossil and anatomical evidence also
share more substantial portions of
their DNA and proteins than more

distantly related species. Gorillas
and humans share all but one amino
acid out of 146 in the hemoglobin
chain.

Sapp mistakenly wrote, “to
this date there has been no evi-
dence ofa helpful mutation.” Some
mutations, however, are beneficial.
Oxygen poisoned ancient life.
Mutations enabled some organisms
to use this poison in metabolism.
The ability to benefit from oxygen
certainly incurred an advantage.
Because of natural selection, all
advantageous mutations must not
occur simultaneously. Due to dif-
ferential reproductive success, it
will not take long (in evolutionary
time) for beneficial mutant traits to
become “normal.”

Stephen J. Gould wrote that
science is not a temple of mono-
lithic knowledge to which bricks
are added by successive discover-
ies. Science resembles a mosaic of
ideas — sometimes incorrect ideas
— that are subject to change in
light of new discoveries. Evolu-
tionary theory should not be dog-
matically accepted as absolute
truth, yet it works to explaina set of
observations and makes accurate
predictions. Evolution is a valid
theory.
