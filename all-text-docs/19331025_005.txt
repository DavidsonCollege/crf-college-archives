Ra CASKIE NORVELL 2.

Now, call the old boy a liar. In
last week’s column, it was said that
the Davidson fighting spirit would
hold the Duke Blue Devils to a
two-touchdown victory, and that’s
exactly what happened. The Dukes
brought a wonder team up here,
and only that Wildcat spirit kept
them from piling up a huge score.
Davidson should be proud of the

showing their team made against such
a powerful gridiron machine as the
Duke team, who is this colttmn’s nom-
ination for the East's representative
in the Rose Bowl. They’ve got the
stuff it takes, and only minor compe-
tition is in the way. On the statistics
of games played to date they should
experience little trouble with Ken-
tucky, Auburn, Maryland, North Car-
olina, N. C. State, and Georgia Tech.

The Ed went deep into his pock-
etbook this week to present four
orchids, and they go to Johnny
Mackorell and John Siewers of
Davidson, and All-American Fred-
die Grawford and Nick Laney of
Duke. However, bouquets can be
presented to Duke’s Cornelius, Cox,
and “Tarzan” Belue, and David-
son’s Potter, Morgan, Hand, Wind-
ham, Hutchins, Verble, and Will-
son. In fact both squads showed
up so well that we should have a
florist’s shop to make awards to all
of them.

Well, now that it’s over and Home-
coming is a thing of the past, let yours
truly say that it was the best Home-
coming since he’s been here, and de-
spite Davidson’s defeat the students
and other spectators had a chance to
see a great Davidson team go befgre
an even greater Duke organization.

This coming Saturday the Wild-
cats go into their third “Big Five”
game of the current season. N. C.
State will furnish the opposition,
and it will be opposition. They
have a fine team down there with
such men as McQuage, Cumiskey,
Stanko, and others.

To date State has beaten Catawba,
7 to 0; been tied by Wake Forest and

Florida in scoreless imbroglios, and
dropped. contests to Clemson and
Georgia. The ’Cats hold wins over

Elon, Wofford, and V. M. I., who con-
quered Maryland last week. The lo-
cals have lost to powerful elevens from
Carolina and Duke.

On paper State is several touch-
downs better than Davidson. How- .
ever, State was hard put to tie
Wake Forest, 0 to 0, while Duke
licked the Deacons handily, 22 to 0.
Duke only beat the Wildcats two
touchdowns, 19 to 7, making Da-
vidson two touchdowns better than
Wake, and therefore two better
than State on paper. And further-
more, Duke’s second team held the
Dekes completely at bay, which
was more than they could do
against Davidson.

Success in past predictions prompts
this statement at this time. You can
quote this column as saying Davidson
will lick State Saturday. And you can
watch them do it on the grid-graph in
Shearer Hall.

Just a word about Julian West
would hardly go amiss here. As
this column goes to press, Jule is
still in the hospital. He suffered a
‘slight concussion of the brain, and
a broken nose. He has completely
recovered consciousness, and will
be okay according to attending
physicians.

The telegram from “Shrimp” Mor-
ris, who is recovering from infantile
paralysis, put a lot of fight and spirit
into both the Davidson team and the
cheering section,

Lack of space prevented score
prognostication last week, but here
we go this week with the Ed’s
choice in capitals:

CARNEGIE TECH vs. W. & J.

The Citadel vs. SOUTH CARO-
LINA (Oct. 26).

Clemson vs. MISSISSIPPI.

DAVIDSON vs. N. C. State.

DUKE vs. Kentucky.

Furman vs. MERCER.

GEORGE WASHINGTON vs.

W. & M., Elon, V. M. I., and Wof-
ford Are Winners as Caro-
lina Loses

In six of. the football games taking
place last Saturday, four of Davidson's
1933 grid opponents came through with
victories, one team lost, and the re-
maining two fought to a scoreless tie.

Williameand Mary walloped Guilford
to the tune of 37 to 7, and Elon won
Randolph-Macon by almost as
a margin, the score being 26
to 0. V. M. I. defeated Maryland 19
to 13, while Wofford eked out a 13-12
victory over Erskine.

North Carolina’s Tar Heels fell vic-
tims to a strong Florida team, 9-0. The
only Big Five contest of the day took
place between North Carolina State
and Wake Forest, the game ending in
a 0-0 tie. :

William and Mary had little diffi-
culty in trouncing Guilford, scoring in
every period.

In the Elon-Randolph-Macon game
the Christians scored in every quarter,
three of their touchdowns coming as
the direct result of passes. Ralph Neal,
Elon fullback, was—the—star—of—the
game. Troppoli, who was such a dan-
ger to the Wildcat runners in the Elon-
Davidson game, also proved to be a
thorn in the sides of the Yellow
Jackets.

Coming from behind in a thrilling
Home-coming encounter, V. M. I.’s
Cadets earned a spectacular 19-13 vic-
tory over Maryland, Billy Smith, the
Cadets’ sensational field general, led
his teammates in a brilliant running
game that upset the Old Liners.

The Wofford Terriers ruined Home-
coming Day for Erskine by taking the
Flying Fleet into camp by a one-point
margin, the score being 13 to 12. Wof-
ford’s touchdowns came in the second
and third quarters, Anderson and Fun-
derburke doing the scoring. Both of
the Erskine tallies came in the third
period.

Although the Carolina-Florida game
was played mostly in the former's ter-
ritory, it was a brilliant display of de-
fensive football, with two stubborn

over
great

lines holding in the critical moments,

and offensive backs being thrown for
loss after loss. Carolina made six first
downs to Florida’s five, but gained
only 43 yards from scrimmage to the
’Gators’ 149, The TartrHeels tried 24
passes, completing five for’a total gain
of 60 yards. Florida tried only seven,
and completed four for 30 yards.
Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons out-
fought N. C. State’s Wolfpack, but the
game ended in a scoreless tie for the
second consecutive year, The Deacons
staged a 78-yard march down the field
in the first half, only to be halted on
State’s three-yard line. Wake Forest
had ten first downs to their opponents’
eight, and gained 171 yards from

scrimmage to 104 for State.

In Cross-Country Run

Corrected Error Evens Score for
’Cats as Frazier Stars

In their first meet of the current sea-
son, a hard-running Davidson cross-
country team tied the powerful Duke
harriers here last Saturday, the score
being 28 to 28.

An error was made in the scoring
Saturday, when Ford, of Duke, who
finished credited with
having placed tenth, due to the fact
that six Davidson men finished before
him, only five of whom counted in the
scoring.

eleventh, was

But upon a check-up of the score
Monday, it was revealed by the rule
book that Ford’s place should édunt
for eleven points instead of ten, there-
by bringing Duke’s total to 28, and ty-
ing the score.

After correcting this error, Captain
Pritchett, Davidson track coach, im-
mediately wrote the Duke mentor, Mr.
Carl Voyles, and informed him of the
mistake,

The event began at a point on the
Concord Road-three miles east of Da-
vidson, and ended in front of the sta-
dium. The time was 15:53.8, and
lacked only 9.5 seconds of equalling
the Davidson record set by “Soup”
3rannon in 1932.

The Wildcat team looked good in the
close race with the Blue Devils, who
last year were Southern Conference
cross-country champions, and who are
running this season with the loss of
only one of last year’s men.

Led by Earle Frazier, fleet sopho-
more runner who broke two Davidson
records in competition last year, the
Wildcats placed six men out of the

Wildcat Spirit Shown
In Duke Pep Meeting

Dr. Oren Moore of Charlotte

Makes Talk

The best pep meeting of the year
was held last Friday night at Shearer
Hall, when the entire Freshman class
and a great number of the upperclass-
men turned out to indicate their whole-

Duke-Davidson game.

Hugh Hawkins, as varsity cheer-
leader, started the meeting off in fine
fashion with a number of Wildcat yells.
A “Duke Moan,”

practiced, and was received with much

new yell, the was

enthusiasm by those present.

The speaker of the evening was Dr.
Oren Moore, of Charlotte, who stated
that the people of his city were back-
ing the Wildcats to the fullest extent.

Continuing, he that
game would settle the disputed ques-

said Saturday's
tion of whether or not a good little
team is as good as a good big’ team.

Cheers were given in hopes of beat-
ing Duke and a speech was made by
Professor Fleagle calling on the sup-
port of the student body to help win
the game,

Led by “Schnozz”
football men were called on to give
their hopes and opinions of the game.
The meeting was ended by the playing
of “O Davidson,” and the siren was
turned on to aid the Wildcat spirit.
