State institutions will
require federal help

By TIM DWIGHT

Institutions have always
been notorious places to keep
people.

The impersonal way workers
treat inmates in these struc-
tures breeds mistreatment and
injustice. This is not surprising
since these places are created to
“take care of” the people the
rest of our society cannot
handle.

What is done to the inhabi-
tants of institutions is a reflec-
tion of what we do when we try

to push them out of our sight.

November could become a ba-
rometer-month for the role of
government in the future of
children’s television advertis-
ing.

In the spring of 1977, two
similar petitions were submit-

latory action in children’s tele-

Children’s Television was re-

request on the belief that ‘‘sell-

A district judge in Maryland
and a federal court in Montana
ruled that the Attorney General:
did not have jurisdiction in
these areas. These courts de-
termined that the States, and
not the Federal government,
should take care of these injust-
ices.

Subsequently a bill (S. 1393
in the Senate and H.R. 9400 in
the House) was drafted to make
explicit and unquestionable the
authority of the Attorney Gen-_
eral to intervene in cases of
injustice in a state institution.

industry, research, and, public
witnesses were scheduled and
held, and general public com-
ment was solicited until mid-

October. If the timetalbe re-

mains intact, late November
would be the point at which
rulemaking would occur, and in
the weeks preceding that antici-
pated event, many cross-cur-
rents have been developing.

The American Academy of
Pediatrics during its annual
convention in Chicago issued an
October 23 statement that it
will propose a complete ban on
television advertising directed
at young children if broadcas-
ters do not voluntarily curtail

*‘sommercial exploitation of
children for profit.” Industry
and broadcasting representa-
tives favor a continuation of

tional Association of Broadcas-
ters and the Council of Better
Business Bureaus.

As the time period narrows,

the strength of the cross-cur-
rents intensifies. One of the
most recent industry strategies
has come from the Kellogg
Company -- acting on behalf of
four national advertiser trade
associations.

In a November ’77 letter to
the head of the Food and Drug
Administration, Pertschuk
made reference to his “convic-
tion” about the “unfairness of
children’s television advertis-
ing.’’ Kellogg Company has
obtained a copy of that letter
and has sent it to Federal Judge
Gerhard Gesell with a request
that Pertschuk be disqualified
from participation in the rule-
making vote on children's tele-
vision advertising.

If Pertschuk were disquali-
fied, it would be highly unlikely
that the three voting commis-
sioners would sustain a decision .
in favor of the ban.

Some long-time, Washing-
ton-based veterans of this issue
predict that a ban will not occur
and that the future of children’s
television advertising is more
likely to feature techniques and
educational approaches de-
signed to enable young children
to recognize ads and learn the
basics of their selling intent.

It’s a little early to predict
the outcome, but the barometer
reading should become more
intelligible later this month.

Had the Trustees been willing

to listen, perhaps their decision
would have been different.

With every right to be embit-
tered by the decision that was
made, Thompson has instead
chosen to work for the best
interests of the college, to help
put a 100-watt station on its
feet, and to stop trying to block
other students from going back
to work for the-college station.
That took character.

Successful
book sale

To the Editor:

We would like to thank the
students, members of the com-
munity and parents who made
Saturday’s APO Book Sale a
success.

The amazing total of eight
hundred and fifty pounds of
books were sold in three hours,
raising eighty-five dollars for
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
in Charlotte. Our chapter will
match this amount making the
total contribution one hundred
and seventy dollars.

We hope you all found some
bargains or long-wanted

“*goodies.’’ Thanks again for
helping us to help a worthy
cause.
