With thecrapid approach of that

Naturally a preat deal can be

said both for and against working.
The disadvantages are rather ob-
vious; long hours of toil and labor,
a weakened mental and physical
condition whieh might well lead to
serious implications, and an ostra-
cism from the opposite sex for the
yreater part of the day. Certainly

one need not stretch his imagina-
tion to arrive at certain other dis-
advantages which are just as con-
crete in nature, but the ones men-
