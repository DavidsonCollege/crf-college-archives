10 THE DAvIDSONIAN

THE LOBSTER
Guest Writer

Hello student body! This is the first time I
have written in The Davidsonian. Why now?
I want to call your attention to the men’s bas-
ketball game on Thursday against College of
Charleston. It is arguably the team’s biggest
game of the year so far.

For those of you who are new (freshmen
and transfers), we tend to dislike the Cou-
gars. They ruin everything. At last year’s
Black Out Belk game Charleston beat us
79-77, breaking our 27 game winning streak
at home and our 43 game winning streak in
conference.

When we met in Chattanooga in the
semi-final of last year’s Southern Confer-
ence Tournament, they knocked us off again
59-52. This loss spoiled our hopes for an
NCAA Tournament bid. I was a sad lobster
that day. Most recently they beat us 67-55
down in Charleston in December. Davidson
had an uncharacteristically poor shooting
performance that day. This time around it
would be great if the ’Cats could ruin things
for them.

As of now, the Cougars have lost one
game in conference play, just this week to
Western Carolina. It would be huge if Da-
vidson gave Charleston its second loss in
consecutive games. Wouldn’t you all love to
see that? I know I would.

Now, I don’t want to say anything bad
about the people at College of Charleston.
My cousin goes there, and she is wonderful.

Get loud for Thursday’ s Blackout Belk showdown with Cougars

But here’s an act of theirs that I feel shows
the true character of Charleston students.

On Friday they won an exciting game
at home against Wofford, scoring the game-
winning basket with less than two seconds

left. Good job Charleston on a solid win:.

They beat a formidable conference ‘foe. But
after the game, the students inexplicably
stormed the court. Come on! They beat Wof-
ford! They did this a few weeks ago when
they beat UNC, but this is completely differ-
ent. They were supposed to beat Wofford!
That is all I’ll say about that.

You judge for yourselves what you think.
Pll move on. Some of you may be reading
this saying, “Hey. We’re 9-11. We have a los-
ing record. Why should I show up Thursday?
I don’t think we have a shot.” You’re wrong
here. But that’s okay! You may have been
reading stuff from people like ESPN.com
writer Pat Forde, who called Davidson “just
another academic school with a sub-.500
basketball team.” Whatever, Pat.

This Davidson team is definitely better
than its record shows. We have ‘been com-
petitive in most of the games we’ve lost.
Remember that Wofford team Charleston
squeaked by at home? We nearly beat them
on the road. I believe we would have won if
Wofford had not been given twice as many
free throws as the Wildcats.

Another narrow loss came against Cor-
nell in overtime. It took a prayer from thirty
feet to sink the Cats. About two weeks later,
that same Cornell team went to Kansas and
almost pulled the upset over the No. 1 ranked

Davidson students cheer on the team during last week’s home game against West-
ern Carolina. Students play a huge role in creating a home court advantage.

Jayhawks. Even in the very first game of the
year the Wildcats hung with then No. 10 But-
ler until the Bulldogs pulled away in the last
few minutes.

Davidson’s worst loss all year is fourteen
points. So hopefully I have convinced you
we have a good team. Because we do! Those
of you who stuck around for the second half
against Western Carolina can vouch for me
here. The Wildcats have their spurts where
they ball outrageously. We’ll hit our shots.
We'll play tough defense. We won’t turn the
ball over. If these spurts become more con-
sistent, Davidson can do some great things.

I encourage all to come out Thursday and

to the final five homes games as well. The
team loves to see Belk Arena packed. The
crowd against Western Carolina was solid. I
was pleased. But on Thursday, I want to see
the student section packed. I want to hear
everyone screaming their heads off for the
whole forty minutes. Hopefully we can help
the team to a big win and a strong finish to
the season!

We can definitely beat Charleston. And
remember, we still have a shot at the NCAA
Tournament if we win the SoCon Tourna-
ment, a task which these Wildcats are capa-
ble of performing. So again, please show up
Thursday night! Thanks. And go ’Cats!
