WILDCAT HANDBOOK

Upperclassmen will choose between juniors
Gary DeVane and Alva Whitehead for editor of the
‘Wildeat Handbook after Monday’s assembly.

Both candidates served on the staff of this year’s
Handbook. They were nominated by Britt Snider,
1985 editor, and were approved by the Publications

oard.

DeVane handled the orientation section of the
current Handbook. He is a hall counselor and a mem-
ber of Alpha Tau Omega. His hometown is Merritt
Island, Fla.

Whitehead, associate editor for 1965, is from
Lake City, S.C. He is a member of the Honor Court
and of Pi Kappa Alpha. .

In his platform, DeVane calls for a broadening
of the scope of the Handbook to “become a com-
prehensive source of information, advice, and en-

Whitehead -~

The Wildcat Handbook in the
past has proved to be of irre-
placable value. to the freshman
and to upperclassman.

For the freshmen, it is the
tirst complete, student-oriented
explanation of the "ins and outs”
of everyday Davidson life. For
the upperclassmen, it is a handy
reference guide. The integration
of these two purposes: will be
continued.

Last year, because of the in-
creasing cost of the handbook,
its size had to be limited to 116 | -
pages. If feasible. I would like
to see the size increased this
year, but I realize that certain
monetary problems are involv-
ed.

I agree with Tom Craig. who
wrote a criticism of the Hend-
book earlier this year, that a
new map of Davidson keyed for
use in faculty visitation and
dance weekends would prove
helpfal.

It is time that the telephone
listings be revised. I know sev-
eral new phones have been put
in at Queens, and probably
other schools. including David-
son. These should be placed in
a mpre strategic place so that
you do not have to thumb
through the book several times
to find them.

lier this year and send letters
to certain freshmen emphasizing
the value often placed on these
by upperclassmen and, in some
cases, by girls’ schools.

As with any publication, some
work tends to be put- off until
the last minute. I will have
deadlines earlier in the year
providing the different section
editors ample opportunity to re-
vise their sections if it is neces-
sary.

There are. of course. certain
things which cannot be done
until the last minute. Having
worked with Britt Snider last
year on these problems of edi-
tion, I think I understand how
to handle them when they arise.

The complete platforms are as follows:

DeVane

I would like to endorse the
1965 Wildcat Handbook but in
so doing, also state that it is
time for a change in the format

' and scepe of this publication.

In the past, the Handbook has

served primarily .as a rush aid |

for upperclassmen and as an
introduction to college campus
leaders, the faculty and adminis-
tration, and school regulations
for incoming freshmen.
Because of the delayed rush,

1 it can no longer function metely |

as an orientation and college
policy guide with some perti-
nent but often irrelevant com-
ment.

The sphere of the Wildcat
Handbook must be broadened so
that it will become a compre-
hensive source of information.
advice and enlightenment for the
freshman throughout the long
first semester when he has no
one to turn to for many ques-
tions concerning social, scholas-
tic or campus functions and ac-
tivities.

I would suggest that of fore-
most importance should be a
thorough evaluation and explan-
ation of the rush system which
eventually evolves out of this
year's disorder. The freshmen
want to know about fraternities,
both pro and con, but really
have nowhere to turn presently.

Education In Economics

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Since everyone tries to be his

own economist, everyone should
study economics so that he will
not make a mess of his own af-
fairs. This was the message.
‘Dr. Frank T. de Vyver pressed
upon the Davidson student body |
in chapel Tuesday.

As the keynoter-of a series of
talks on economics and to illus-
trate his point. de Vyver ex-
ploded several of the major
**mvths’’ of economics.

The popular opinion that in-
creasing overtime pav by 100%
will decrease unemployment
was quickly bombed by de Vy-
ver. He zeroed in with the an-
swer that there is already too
much overtime, “‘and instead we
should create more jobs."

De Vyver's own experience as
vice-president of Erwin Mills|
served him well as he sniped
at the assumption that low pay
yields lower costs. His mill in
North Carolina averaged $1.30.
per hour pay, while the one ‘in
Mississippi overaged $.70. He
continued, “The denim produced
in Mississippi was twice as ex-
pensive as the denim produced
in North Carolina.”

Similarly treated were such
adages as “All government de-

posits create inflation". ‘Trade
unions are bad,"" “All govern-
‘ment spending is bad", and
“The economy of the individual
is thé same as the nation.”
Some of those are obvious even

to those of us who are “‘ignor-
ant,”” but others must be ex-
plained and, whether or not he
meant to. de Vyver did not.
Maybe we do need a little edu-
cation in economics.
