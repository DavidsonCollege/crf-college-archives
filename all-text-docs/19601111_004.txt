Guest House: Center
For College Visitors

. By FRED HARRISON
Davidsonian Feature Writer

A period of two months in the spring of 1956 as Hos-
tess of the Guest House has led to four years at David-
son for Mrs. J. B. Huntington.

Throughout the year, Mrs.
Huntington: welcomes a succes-
sion of campus visitors — par-
ents of students, speakers,
young ladies, and scholarship
applicants in the early spring.

The empty rooms of the old
building early in the week give
no hint of the full house that
can be expected for a big week-
end, .

{f° When asked about her four
years at Davidson, Mrs. Hunt-
ington described them as
“perfectly delightful.” “I
heave enjoyed meeting the
many different guests and
making interesting contacts,”
she remarked.

Mrs. Huntington was born in
Asheville and still finds time to
return to the mountain coun-
try. She studied English and
Music at Meredith College in
Raleigh before she was mar-
ried. Besides studying music
history, Mrs. Huntington likes
to play the piano and does so
by ear.
> Inthe summer when the
campus is aimost deserted,

Mrs. Huntington enjoys read-
ing. She is especielly inter-
ested in biographies and his-
torical novels, and lest sunr
mer she read the Harvard
Classics collection.

When August comes aronnd,
Mrs. Huntington finds time to
take a few weeks off to return
to Asheville to visit her four
grandchildren. She also has
two grandchildren in Michigan.

As she pointed out the
high ceilings and large win-
dows in the reception room,

Mrs. Huntington recounted s

short history of the Guest

House.

The brick building was con-
structed in 1918 and was used

building was remodeled to serve’
as a Guest House to offer par-

Council Votes To Change
Frosh Regulations, Court

The Court of Control was for the second week the
topic of discussion at the entire Student Council meeting
Monday night. The Council decided to recommend this
week that the posts of Freshman Adviser and Judge of
the Court of Control be combined.

The motion to incorporate the
duties of Freshman Adviser and
Judge of the Court of Control
was passed in contrast to last
week's action. Then the Stud-
ent Council decided to make no
changes in the physical make-
up of the Court. But after re-
consideration the Council felt
that the only way to achieve
their aim of making the Court
“dignified, firm, and rigorous”
was to change its traditional
make-up.

The new Adviser and Judge

would be elected in the men-
ner that the present Presh-
men Adviser is. The Advis-
er is now elected in the
spring by the rising senior
class from its ranks. The
Freshman Adviser is @ vot-
ing member of the Council.
Also, the members of the
Court would be appointed by
the Council as it is at present.

There was much discussion

cake aod sang “Happy Birth-jas to who would be the mem-

day” with the Pep Band accom-
panying.

President Martin stood on the
Chambers balcony with Student
Body President Henry Shue and
thanked everyone for the pro-
gram. (He had been meeting
with Davidson’s Board of Visi-
tors inside).

Afterwards, a series of pep
calls were made for the Wild-
cats and Coach Bill Dole, tackle
Bill Salzer and halfback Jerry
Sheffield were asked to speak.

Although the drama group
has not selected lead parts for
these plays, much of the plan-
ning for the production has
been accomplished. The Vaga-
bonds will present “Waiting for
Godot” at a later date, January

11 and 12.

The three comic plays which
will be presented on either
November 30 or December 1
are: “It Shouldn't Happen to
ja Dog” by Wolf Mankoorristy,
“passion, Poison, and Petrifa-
ction” by G. B. Shaw, and “If
Men Played Cards As Women
Do” by George S. Kaufman. In
addition the players will present
a two’ minute interlude, “The
Tridget of Greva,” by Ring
Lardner.

The first, “It Shouldn't Hap-
pen to a Dog,” is a seriocomic
treatment of the story of Jonah
which departs from the tradi-
tional account. ‘Passion, Poison.
and Petrifaction’ could be

due to the illness of the leading man,
Dillard. Instead the Vagabonds expect to perform three
modern one act comedies plus a two minute interlude on

was passed on this subject, but
several alternatives were con-
sidered. Among these were to

Contemporary Art
Now On Exhibit

During the next month, 70
original prints by contemporary
artists will be exhibited on the
campus. These modern French
and Italian etchings and litho-
graphs are on loan from the
Roten Gallery in Baltimore.
The paintings can be seen in
the Union and the lobby of
Chambers building.

The works cover a wide
range in style, including ex-
amples of realism, surrealism,
abstraction,, non-objective, and
romantic realism.

The prints range in price
from four dollars to one hun-
dred dollars, averaging about
thirty dollars. Persons inter-
ested in purchasing any of these
sheuld contact Dr. R. J. Cal-
houn or Prof. Phillip Moose.

from the orientation group
leaders of the hall counselers.

The council voted to re-
move from the Freshman Reg-
ulations the regulation forbid-
ding freshmen to walk on the
grass of the campus. Also, the
regulation requiring the at-
tendance of freshmen at all
home athletic contests would
be to require ettendence only
when the Freshmen ere on
campus. .

The Council considered 2
number of other points in its
continuing discussion of the
Court of Control. This discus-
sion will probably last for at
least two more weeks. The
Council also considered extend-
ing the period of effect for the
Freshmen Regulations in the
light of Sophomore Rush.

The Council planned to give
the Court clear disciplinary
powers, but hes not as yet
considered specific punish-
ments. The intent of this re-
‘vision is to mak the Court
both a disciplinary and ad-
visory institution.

Henry Shue, said ‘that work
on the revision and attempt to
find an accurate, up-to-date ver-
sion of the constitution was
progressing satisfactorily. ,
Jack Taylor and John Pack-

er, members of the Council will
attend the Interim Council of
the State Student Legislature
at Duke University in Durham,
N. C., Sunday. This Council
will prepare final plans for ‘a

ilar to the various state legisla-
tures, to be held in early De-
cember.

Debating Group Make |
Plans For Second Team

Davidson College’s expanding debate group is making plans for the team’s first

local appearance.

Professor Drake, faculty ad-
visor to the debating group, is
trying to organize a second de-
bate team, expanding the pres-
ent group to two full teams and
two alternate teams. Tentative
members of this new team are
Lou Allen, Lenox Baker, John
Rankin, and either R. H. Keiter
or H. M. Fisher.

OPEN TOURNAMENT

a

It is hoped that this team
will be organized before De-
cember 9. If so, Davidson will
have two full teams represent-
ing them in the Southeastern
States Open Tournament at Ap-
palachian State Teachers Col-
lege, in Boone.

Each oi the debating teams
has been practicing separately.

jIn future practice sessions,

however, they will: practice to-
gether, so that the affirmative

4of one team may be argued

against the negative of the oth-
er, and vice-versa.

MOCK DEBATE

The debating group hopes to
have a mock debate in assemb-
ly between now and the Open
Tournament in Boone. Profes-
sor Drake hopes to put on a
full debate soon. Of this he
says: “We need more than
anything else to stand up and
talk before an audience of some
size.”

As announced in a previous
issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN,
the debate team will attend the
12th Annual Invitational Debate
Tournament at the Florida
State University, February 17
and 18. This will be the group's
big trip of the year. On March
9, 10, and 11, the team will at-
tend the 29th Annual South At-
lantic Forensic Tournament at

Professor Drake is looking
for another match for the lat-
ter part of March or the first
part of April. He has written

ble, for a debate meet.
Professor Drake says of the
debate team: “The boys seem
enthusiastic and ready to work
hard. Mr. Elliot and I are very

Bob Blake's Band Plays
“Smooth” Music, No R &R

By EOD RUDERT
Davidsonian Feature Writer
“There is such a potential of musicians at Davidson,
it was inevitable that a dance band should be formed
here,” said Bob Blake, a senior from Abbeville, S. C.

Blake has formed at Davidson
a band which, along with an-
other group at Mooresville, are
known as the “Men of Music.”

Blake plays lead alto sax, and
John Oehler and a man who
comes in from Charlotte plays
the other saxes. Gaines Grant-
ham and another musician from
Charlotte are the trumpets.

Dick Merchant is on piano,
and Raymond Weeks on bass.
Price Caldwell is the trombon-
ist, and the drummer is from
Mooresville.

“We have jobs booked in
this part of North Caroline
and some in South Carolina.
We have a few weekends left
open, some Fridsy nights,”
commented Blake. “We have
dates at some high school
dances, Memorial Nurses Hos-
pital, and a fraternity fune-
tion.

“You see,” he stated, “basi-
cally this band has been in ex-
istence since the spring of this
year. Things have really been
shaping up since we first start-

ed. That was a rough job, that
first one. We've changed a
few things since then; we have
all new red coats to give the
band a little color.

“We just play smooth mu-
sic,” Blake stressed, as he
leaned back in his chair. “The
style | like to try to create is
just an ‘easy fo dance to’
type of music. We don’t do
any rock and roll. [t's more
of a big band style.

“You see, we play mainly at
large dances or parties for mid-
dle-aged people or young mar-
ried couples who want that kiad
of music.

“We do mostly stock arrange-
ments of most of the standard
tunes. However, we use a few
arrangements that Dick Merch-
ant and I have done together.”

Blake mentioned that the
members of the band were
chosen for their ability and be-
cause they all like to play. “In-
terest and a desire to play are
what hold a band together,” he
said.

SOME DAY “OUTTALK” PEOPLE

Los Angeles area. As a pioneer in this new data
transmission field Stu predicts data processing
machines will some day do more Long Distance
“talking” than people.

Stu contacted 12 other companies before join-
ing Pacific Telephone. ‘I don’t think there’s any
limit to where a man can go in the telephone
business today. Of course, this isn’t the place for
a guy looking for a soft touch. A man gets all the
opportunity he can handle right from the start.
He’s limited only by how well and how fast he
can cut it.”

He got what he bargained for (and a little
more) when he joined Pacific Telephone. One of
Stu’s early assignments was to find out how
existing Long Distance networks could be used
to pipeline high speed “conversations” between
computers in distant cities.

The fact that he did a fine job did not go
unnoticed.
