Cats Lose In Overtime By 3,
Take Revenge On Keydets

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Davidson's Cagers split their
two games last week. losing to
West Virginia 88-85 in double
overtime and defeating VMI
105-88.

The West Virginia game
displayed two prominent traits
of the ‘72-73 Wildcats. These
two traits are the team's
inability to pull away from a
team and their scrappy never
give up attitude.

The first half was played
evenly with Davidson having
the slight advantage as they
built up a lead as big as eight
points. The half ended with the
Cats holding a 38-34 advantage.

Starting off quickly in the
second half, the Cats built their
lead to as much as 11 points. It
looked at this point as if the
game would be a runaway.
However, the lead remained
about the same until West
Virginia ran off eight straight

Pecorak’s Reputation
‘An Emotional Thing’

By BOB WETZEL
Staff Writer
T. Jay Pecorak has a
reputation.

When one thinks of the junior
trom Fairtax, Virgima, words
such as enforcer, bad-boy, and
muscleman often jump into
one’s mind. Almost every
Davidson basketball fan) can
think of a few incidents during
the past two vears in which the
younger Pecorak has lived up to
this image.

Even “Sports Hlustrated”’,
probably the nation’s most
prestigious sports periodical
made reterence to his physical
playing stvle ino one of its
basketball reviews earlier this
season,

He may play rough but it’s not
the sort of thing that’s totally
unnecessary. Pecorak is just
65° and only 210, but he usually
ends up drawing the detensive
assigninent on the opponent's
best forward

“T have to be aggressive in
that situation.” he commented.
“Tt might also be that aggressive

play runs in the Pecorak
family.” he said.
Older brother John, this

year’s team captain, has never
been known to give the gamethe
“kid glove” treatment.

However, for T. Jay it) ts
primarily an emotional thing.

“T used to get so psyched
before a game that every player
on the opposing team was a
Mortal enemy. | got so worked
up that Lactually hated the other
team.”

Bul the stvle has been more
restramed recently

“Tdow't get as excited before
the game anymore.” he added.
“Possibly its the realization
that) the officials know my
repulation and are aware ol
what I'm doing. I can't get
away withes much.”

But in a reugh contest, he ts
never al a loss.

The recent’ double-overtime
loss to West Virginia was one ot
those physical games where the
officials “let them play.” T.
Jay was up to the occasion, con-
tributing 18 points and collec-

ting 10 rebounds in one of his
best performances of late,
But overall, the vear has been

* somewhat disappointing tor the

junior forward. He is a winner
and the Cats have been losing.
The 60 percent shooting that
placed. him amony the nation’s
leaders in that statistic early in
the season has now ebbed below
30 percent,

However. the rebound
average has risen. He is also
averaging in double figures in
spite of the shooting slump.

Commenting on team per-
formance, T. Jay said. “We've
got to loosen up to win. T think

everyone, both players and
coaches have reacted to losing
in the face of pre-season op-
timism. We know that we're a
better team than our record
shows.”’

He added that many of the
players have restricted their in-
dividual styles because of the
tension and the regimentation
of the Davidson offense.

“If we loosen up. as we did
against Wake Forest and VMI,
we'll win.” the junior forward
said.

But if we stay tight, we'll con-
tinue to blow leads as we've
done all season.” he said.

Runners ‘Find Weak Spots’
In Two Recent VMI Meets

Returning from two meets at
VMI, Davidson's winter track
team ‘discovered what needs to
be done and found out areas of
weakness.’ according to Head
Coach Sterling Martin.

The Davidson thinclads were
one of 52 colleges that par-
ticipated in this past weekend's
annual VMI Relays. One of the
most popular meets of the win-
ter season, the Relays attracted
such name track powers as
Duke, East Tennessee,
Maryland, North Carolina cen-
tral, and the remaining
majority of most southeastern
colleges.

Entered in the 440, 880, sprint
medley, distance medley and
four mile relays, Davidson's
thinclads failed to place.

However, according to Mar-
tin, “We used the Relays as just
a training meet. It's very hard
to compete on an even level
with the big track powers this

early in the season.

After resting one day, the
Wildcat track team met VMI
and Furman ina tri-meet in the
VMI fieldhouse. Sore from
Saturday's meet, Davidson
managed to score only 10 points
in the triple encounter’ with
VMI taking second and Furman
a dominant first.

Although the team was
somewhat frustrated, and

disappointed, Martin was
reasonably satisfied. “We
have a lot of work to do before
spring season, but considereing
the time of the season, we did
fairly well. I was pleased with
Mark Connor's performances in
the broad jump and 60 yd. dash,
along with Woody Van Meter in
the pole vault and Allan Duncan
in the high jump.” he said.

Duncan, a freshman from
Shrewsbury. Mass.. took time
off from J.V. basketball to
compete this weekend and
placed third in the high jump in
last Monday's meet.

Woody Van Meter. current
Davidson record holder in the
pole vault, took third in the tri-
meet with a jump of 12 ft. 6 in.
The winning jump was a near
stadium record at 15 ft.

Top scorer for the team was
sophomore Mark Connors.
Scoring five out of the team’s lu
points, Connors took second in
the broad jump and third in the
60 yd. dash.

**Mark did a real fine job. He
normally is a middle distance
runner but he decided he wan-
ted to broad jump and run the
60."° commentéd Martin.

The only remaining point
scorer for the team was Shot-
.putter Steve Shankweiler, with
a fourth in the weight event.

points tocut the lead to three at
61-58.

The game was played even
until West Virginia took their
first lead since 2-0 with 3:50
remaining to be played in
regulation. The lead changed
back and forth in the last
minutes with no one leading by
more than one point.

With two seconds remaining
T. J. Pevorak was fouled and
had a one-and-one free throw
chance with West Virginia
leading 69-68. He made the
first but missed the second so
the game was forced into over-
time at 69 all.

In the first overtime period.
Davidson demonstrated its
ability to come back from a
deficit and get back into a
game. West Virginia now
looking like a new team quickly
built up an 80-72 lead with less
than a minute and a_ half
remaining. Davidson put on all
court) pressure and miracu-
lously tied the game at 80 all to
end the first overtime.

The two teams split the first
four baskets of the second over-
time. Then West Virginia got
two more. This time all the Cats
could manage was one more
point and the game ended 88-85.

Leading the Cats in scoring
was T.J. Pecorak with 18 points.
Also in double figures were
Greg Dunn, John Falconi and
John Pecorak who scored 16, 15
and 11 points respectively.
Larry Horowitz pulled down a
game high 13 rebounds while T.
J. Pecorak hauled in 10.

When asked about his team’s
inability to pull away from an
opponent, Coach Terry Holland

commented that because of the
team’s size, they are ‘‘not a con-
sistent rebounding team.” This
fact was very evident against
West Virginia because during
the Mountaineers comeback in
the second half many missed
foul shots were turned into West

Virginia baskets.
Another reason for this
inability to pull away, ac-

cording to Holland, is that the
team plays too cautiously when
they get a lead. Holland said
that to run a team out, “we
would need to play flawless
basketball for 40 minutes."

Flawless basketball would
almost be the word to describe
Davidson's first half per-
formance against the VMI
Keydets.

The Cats built up a 21 point
lead in the first half and went in-
to the locker room with the
score 59-42.

Davidson had_ shot a
phenomenal 69.9 percent from
the floor. Also for the first time
Davidson had used all 11
players in the first half. Two of
Davidson's 59 first half points
were a result of Greg Gerdy's
first points of the year.

The Cats slacked off in the
second half and coasted to the
victory with the score ending
105-88. The Cats finished the
game with a field goal per-
centage of 59.4.

The team placed four men in
double figures led by Dunn who
had 20 points. Falconi, Mike
Sorrentino and Horowitz added
17, 13 and 12 respectively.
