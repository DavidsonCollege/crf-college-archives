“Speech is a mirror of the soul: as a man
speaks, so is he.”
‘Mend thy speech a little lest it mar thy
fortune.” —Shakespeare.

PURE SPEECH NEEDED.

‘There is a world of casualties. Not
only are people being thrown into car-
nage and slaughter but the King’s Eng-
lish is being horribly, mercilessly, care-
lessly butchered. ‘This butchering is
nothing less than thoughtlessness, “Lhis
is practiced by many members of our
student body. Occasionally we hear
“We didn't have no army when we first
started out.” ‘He don’t need no notes.”
And very often we hear the inevitable
“ain't.”

Students of Davidson! This is
thoughtlessness, pure and simple, on our
parts. Many of us are guilty of this.
Few are immune. Much of this, tho
incorrect as it is, is sanctioned by the
public. We cannot afford to approve
of it by using it. But if we indulge it
will ruin us socially and a continuance
of this habit will throw us into eddies
and whirlpools of embarrassments. We
must stop now—those of us who are
guilty—and reclaim ourselves and be
reinstated into the grace and favor. of
King Good English.

Of course we know there is no such
word as “ain't. We know that we should
use “doesn’t” instead of “don’t” in the
third person singular. We know to
make a negative that “didn’t have no” is
wrong. How then shall we reclaim our-
selves! Just do this—Stop! Think!
Speak! This is the only way thru which
it can be done. In writing, these er-
rors are not made. Why? We think
while writing, but not when speaking.
Qur language. when properly spoken, is
a beautiful and graceful thing. Our
speech can be made beautiful and per-
fect.

Our fortunes are being marred and
our vocabulary is being seared with er-
rors and slang. This, we cannot allow.
Let us all resolve that purity of speech
shall rule at Davidson. Let us make
ourselves a part of this pure speech cam-
paign, and let it be an individual thing
that we stop, think, and speak.

Reports from Eastern and Middle
Western colleges show a fall in attend-
ance from ten to fifty per cent.

DAVIDSONIAN, October 3, 1917

ATTENTION !

There is a good deal of misunder-
standing and lack of understanding as
to the Honor System and as to the func-
tion of the Damage System, its Commit-
tee, and the student's relations to them.
A Junior has recently been heard to say
that it has never been explained to him.
One of the members of the Damage
Committee has written an article, which
appears elsewhere in these columns, de-
scribing this system. We recommend
that you read this article and know
this organization and your
relation to it.

Twenty-seven to six shows that Coach
Fetzer’s boys can hold Josephus’ Navies.
What are we going to do with the other
lines? Watch our team—-they are go-
ing some.

Some might find consolation in the
saying of the German writer, Heine:
“History proves that the majority — of
men who have accomplished anything
great have passed their youth (college
days) in seclusion.”

This, as is the German nation and
povernment, is to be discounted and dis-
credited. However, with all respects to
Rumple, we hope there is consolation,
for some are sore about an editorial ap-
pearing in last issue.

The Press Club met with admirable
success. Many students proved them-
selves loyal to the college. One amus-
ing letter came to a member of this club
from a supposedly high-standing paper.
The letter printed helow is from a man-
aging editor of a daily newspaper in one
of the best cities in the State:

“Dear Sir: Have your application
for job on hand and regret we have no
opening for the line of work you men-
tion. Would be glad, however, to place
vour name on the list as correspondent
for emergency news— murders, big ac-
cidents, and other news of consequence.
Tf the biggest man in your town rob. the
bank or clopes with the minister’s wife
shoot it along and we will gladly use it
and pay space rates. Davidson is too
far away for local news to be of interest
here.”

We cannot appreciate this editor’s po-
sition nor comprehend his width and
breadth of vision. Neither is it conceiv-
able how a man in his position says that
news from the biggest college under
Presbyterian control is not ‘news of
consequence.”

One Million Dollats—Four Hundred
Marks.

The German Government has done
many things which makes our blood boil.
But to make the American people more
indignant and bloodthirsty the Kaiser
recently offered four hundred marks for
the return—dead or alive—of the first

United States soldier. This is a dastardly

deed by the modern Mephistopheles.

Now the newspapers and other or-
ganizations and citizens of Georgia, are
subscribing one million dollars to be re-
warded to the American who will ad-
vance the cause of humanity by taking
the Kaiser's scalp. This is a today-ex-
ample of Bentham’s maxim—‘“The
greatest good to the greatest number.”
Tho if we agree entirely that that cause
of civilization would be advanced we
cannot become shot thru with Epicu-
reanism. The people of Georgia are
carrving this too far. Should he come to
their state they would not agree with
Achilles, who. sulking said:

“Oh! but the life of man is not a
subiect for raiding. or barter. No, nor
returneth again after leaping the fence
of the body.” ,

Rut when this money is rewarded
probably the world can come to terms
with some sound, rational man.
