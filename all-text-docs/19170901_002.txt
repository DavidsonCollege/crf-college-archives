THE COLLEGE VEAR 1917-18.

The college year soon to begin will
he the most momentous one in the his-
tery of the colleges of America. We
are not forgetful of the conditions dur-
ing and after the Civil War. But now
it will be more momentous because there
are so many more colleges and so many
more men will be educated.

The Officers’ ‘Training Camp and the
draft have made enormous runs on the
men of college age and aspiration, De-
spite this, the college authorities have
made wonderful strides in’ filling, the
places of those who by choice and by
necessity are deprived of partial or com-
plete college training.

The year will mark the beginning of
it change of college ideals, “This year
will be characterized by more zeal for
collegiate training. ‘Those undesirable
elements are largely of the past. Many
men have been coming to colleges for
purposes other than developing their in-
dividualitids and thosd powers which
lie within one. Now those aims and
ideas foreign to the college can best be
accomplished away from college in other
fields. He who enters college now al-
lies himself with the same movement,
hut a movement invigorated, enlivened.
and pregnant with the tonic demands of
the time.

TO THE MEN OF 1921 OF DAVIDSON
COLLEGE.

We are glad that you have cast your
lot with us. There is not a body of
students anywhere who will, give you a
more cordial welcome. “There is not a
college where ideals are any higher and
in no place is the Christian atmosphere
so bracing and healthful to the student
life.

You will be met at the train by mem-
bers of the Y. M. C. A. Reception Com-
mittee. It is their privilege to cordially
welcome you and give you any advice
which you mav desire. To many of
you things will be entirely new. Do
not hesitate to ask any question which
you want to know. The members of
this committee will be glad to give you
all the assistance and show you the
courtesies which lie within their power.
J. B. Daffin, who has charge of this
work, has called to his aid those who
will take an interest in you and help
you “get hold of the ropes.”

Another thing, study the catalog.
Know just where you want to room.
Find out all the information the catalog
can give you. Talk with a Davidson
graduate or student if possible and ask
him to talk with you about the college

THE RETURN.

Members of the student body have
spent their vacations in pléasant and
profitable places and vocations. Some
are in training camps; some have been
on the farms; some have been in uni-
versities; some have been in offices, and
in various other places. Now the time
has arrived when all of these pleasant
avocations will be changed to the pleas-
urable vocation of completing a college
education. Many will be the cordial
handshakes and “Did you have a pleas-
ant vacation?’ The same fine Red and
Black spirit which is ever the same will
be united and its potential will be in-
creased. The college walls will rejoice
for our return.

It will be the aim of the Staff to give
our readers first-hand articles concern-
ing the various phases of military life.
Davidson has many men—all men of
ability—many men of literary genius
and talent. We aim to get in touch
with these ‘pioneers whose business — is
“Licking Germany,” and publish articles
of theirs with which those of Mary Rob-
erts Rinehart cannot vie. Watch our
columns for these stirring informative
articles full of individuality.

MARRIAGE ANNOUNCEMENT

home in Davidson after the tsth of Sep-
tember.

PROF. H, B. OVERCASH:
"TO ‘TEACH BIOLOGY

In the absence of Dr. J. W. MeCon-
nell, the popular college physician and
professor of Biology, Prof. H. B. Over-
cash has been secured by Dr. Martin
to take charge of this department. Pro-
fessor Overcash is a graduate of the
class of ‘15. He held the distinction of
being one of the best students of his
class. Since his graduation he has been
head of the Science Department of Ca-
tawhba College. During the summer he
did special work in Zoology and in ex-
perimental Biology at the University of
Virginia. Professor Overcash will give
the same courses of instruction which
heretofore have been given and they will
he interesting and tducational in every
respect.

pe

The Summer School session of the
University of Virginia was a pleasant
and profitable one. Fight Davidsonians
had the privilege of being under the
shadow of Monticello—the home of
Thomas Jefferson. Dr. J. M. McCon-
nell was professor of Ancient History.
Miss Louise Manning was taking work
preparatory to entering Randolph-Ma-

con Woman's College. Prof. H. B.
Overcash, ‘15, did special work — in
courses in Biology. Others taking

courses were: A. B. Reese, '17; Ed.
White. W. M. Fountain, '18; R. H.
Stone, '18. and A. L. Wilson, ’20.

ENGLISH COURSE

The article “What Is English” in a
recent issue of The Educational Re-
view, discusses some very important
technicalities regarding the modern Eng-
lish courses. It also shows to what de-
gree the objects of the English courses
in colleges have been changed. as a re-
sult of time and demand. The second-
ary schools are even changing from the
old vitiated mode of preparation, having
a long list of books read, to that of
proficiency in English composition.

There was a time when the depart-
ment of English at Yale contended that
the thing to do with Freshmen in the
English course was to put them to read-
ing. At the same time the chair of Eng-
lish at Harvard said that the proper
method was to have the student to write
compositions. Written work was_ re-
quired at every. recitation. Each of the
two universities was trying to prove to
the educational institutions and to the
world that their method of giving  in-
struction in English was the ideal. Now
Yale has recognized that she has, for
these many years, been holding on to a
mere fancy. Their theory has proven
itself false. and the Harvard students
are the gainers.

In disctissing this almost sudden in-
novation in the English course at Yale
University the writer quotes the cata-
log. In tor2 “the aim is to foster the
habit of intelligent reading.” The Yale
catalog of 19r4. “Preparation in English
has two main objects, command of cor-
rect and clear English, spoken and writ-
ten.”

This change was introduced, not only
at Yale, but in all the colleges of higher
standing is one,of merit and is encircled
with a halo of appreciation by the col-
legiate world. .

Some research in our own catalogs
show that this remarkable innovation is
equally true at Davidson. The catalog
of 1895, in describing the English
courses, has in part: “The Freshman
class recites once a week... . To foster
a taste for the best authors, classic prose
and poetry, are studied every — year.
Frequent. essays, compositions, or criti-
cisms are required thruout the whole
course.”

In that year the main object was to
cultivate an appreciation for poetry and
prose,

The catalog of 1900 comes nearer to
the present-day conception of the func-
tion of the college English course: ‘The
objects of the course are to train the
student to write clearly, accurately, vig-
orously, and, if possible, gracefully; to
cultivate correct literary tastes and ap-
preciation, and to give a true idea of
the historical development of the Eng-
lish language and literature. Parallel
readings and frequent compositions, es-
says and criticisms are required thruout
the course.”

The deficiency of the old objects of
the college English course was realized.
The lasting good is not merely apprect-
ation so much as it is efficiency. The
charm, grace, gravity, and melody of the
higher forms of literature is of not much
ultimate benefit to a person unless he
can express clearly and forcefully his
thoughts in oral or written words. Dav-
idson College made the change even be-
fore Yale. Noting the latter's attitude
to the course in 1912 and that of the
former in) 1910, which is: ‘The
courses in English furnish instruction in
composition, the history of the language
and literature. Their object is to give
to the student (1) ability to express his
own thoughts thru spoken or written
words, and (2) the ability to gain aes-
thetic pleasure thru his native _ liter-
ature.”

The Davidson Freshman does not
snend his hours of preparation for Eng-
lish in pondering over, and trying to

———— ee

appreciate, uninviting books, but in for-
mulating a way in which he can give
adequate expression to his own opinions.
Sentences are analyzed, weighed, and
balanced. Critcism is made by him of
his fellow student's theme. When this
work is done, is mastered, the function
of the Modern Freshman English
Course is fulfilled, and the desire for
reading and study inevitably follow.

THE BEST LETTER.

You may write a thousand letters to the
maiden you adore

And declare in every letter that you

_ love her more and more.

Yuu may praise her grace and beauty
in a thousand glowing lines

And compare her eves of azure with the
brightest star that shines.

If vou had the pen of Byron you would
use it every day

In composing written worship to your
sweetheart far away;

But the letter far more welcome to an
older, gentler breast

Is the letter to your mother from the
bov she loves the best.

Youthful blood is fierce and flaming.
and when written to your love

‘Sou will rave about your passion, swear-
ing by the stars above,

\ owing by the moon's white splendor
that the girlie you adore

ts the ene you'll ever cherish as no maid
was loved before.

You will pen full many a promise on
those nages white and dumb

That you never can five up to in the
married vears to come.

But a much more precious letter, bring-
ing more and deeper bliss

Is the letter to your mother from the
bow she can not kiss.

She will read it very often when the
lights are soft and low,

Sitting in the same old corner where she
held you years ago,

And regardless of its diction or its spell-
ing or its style,

And altho its composition would provoke
a critic's smile.

In her old and trembling fingers it be-
comes a work of art,

Stained by tears of joy and sadness as
she hugs it to her heart.

Yes, the letter of all Imers, look where
ever you may 4
