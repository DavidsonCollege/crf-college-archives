Still Whistlin’ Dixie |
George Ducas is here to stay

Well, George Ducas is finally
here.

I heard George for the first
time two years ago on a ‘poorly
dubbed demo, four or five times
removed from its original. Through
the dim monosound, atalented new
artist entered my collection and
found himself at the top of my A-
list.

Ducas’s first release, a self-
titled debut from Liberty Records,
marks a solid exit from the realm

of garage recordings and into the
mainstream music industry.
George wrote or co-wrote every
song on the album enlisting the aid
of veteran writers Terry McBride
(of McBride and the Ride) and
Kim Ritchey (Radney Foster’s
“Nobody Wins”) among others.
Though now living in Nash-
ville, the streets of Bakersfield
seem to have left their impression
on Ducas. A rockabilly sound per-
vades most of the songs, betraying

direct influences from Buck Owens
and more recently Dwight
Yoakam.

His first single, “Teardrops,”
exemplifies those influences.
“Shame on Me” and “Hello Cruel
World” follow suit. Possible up-
coming singles include “Kisses
Don’t Lie”—country’s version of
D. H. Lawrence’s masterpiece
Lady Chatterley’s Lover — and
“In No Time At All” — reminis-
cent of the recent hit, “Win Your

Heart Again.”

With the exception of one or *

two songs, the album is a great first
release, certainly worth your con-
sideration. George Ducas does,
~ however, suffer from his dive into
the mainstream. After seeing him
in Nashville, Scott Lenhart (a die-
hard Ducas fan) says, “He’s a great
guitarist, and it’s sorely missed in
the CD.”
Overarrangement plagues
parts of album, most especially

“Waiting and Wishing” and “Lip-
stick Promises” (two great live
songs).

Luckily, George’s voice, driv-
ing rockabilly rhythms, and origi-
nal lyrics maintain the album, and
keep it, if not right next to his old
garage demo, not far below.

So, get yourself down to
Hometown Records to pick this
one up. George Ducas has finally
arrived, and he is definitely here to
stay.

Orion String Quartet displays virtuosity and cohesion

By Rachel Newcomb

On Monday, November 7, the
Orion String Quartet delighted a
Davidson audience in Hodson Hall.
Violinist Isaac Stern has called the
quartet a representative of the next
generation of excellence in cham-
ber music, and the youthful group
lives up to this praise. They per-
formed works by Mozart,
Kirschner, and Beethoven.

By seating the two violinists
opposite each other, the quartet
successfully achieved an equality
among. all four members: first
violin, second violin, viola, and
cello. In their first piece, Mozart’s
Quartet in d Minor (K.421), the
quartet displayed their interpretive
virtuosity. During the beginning
of the third movement (Menuetto:
Allegretto), it almost sounded like
a duel between the first violin and
cello and the second violin and
viola.

The next piece, Kirschner’s
Second Quartet, changed the tone
of the performance by incorporat-
ing modern, twentieth century
work. Made up of three move-
ments rather than four, the piece
was spontaneous and skillfully per-

formed by the quartet.

The final quartet of
Beethoven’s Opus 59 closed the
performance. Known collectively
as the Rasumovsky Quartets, the

work featured Todd Phillips on
first violin and his brother Daniel
on second. The profoundly vis-
ceral mood of the piece made it an
exhilirating end to the concert.

As a group, the Orion String
Quartet had an excellent rapport
with each other and appeared to be
visually relaxed.. Each member
was extremely skillful and obvi-

ously derived greatenjoyment from
performing. It is this enjoyment,
as well ascommunication between
members, which makes this string
quartet successful.

Anyone who has attended

Davidson College basketball
games over the last three years
could not help but notice two
very vocal fans, Jason Burt and
Joe Beach. These two faithful
fans now are trying to bring their
support for basketball to a new
level by organizing the Crazy
Cats Club. |

“They hope this club will —~
create a link between the spirit
teams and fans and increase
spirit overall at basketball games.
They plan to sell T-shirts at the
first game November 29 against
Wake Forest and also sign up
people who are interested in
joining the club.

Those crazy cats

Spirit club aims to improve enthusiasm at basketball games

Open to anyone who enjoys
yelling and screaming at sporting
events in support of their team,
the only membership require-
ment is to attend home games.
Club members will be encour-
aged to wear Davidson T-shirts
to intimidate opposing teams.

The idea of this club
originated with Jeannette Scire,
who wanted to increase intensity

at ‘basketball games: Butt said’

that the club “wants to help the
spirit team out and bridge the gap
between the fans and the spirit
team.” Beach hopes to “make
the games more enjoyable by
getting the fans more actively
involved in the games.”

These two crazy cats will

make the club similar to the
Cameron Crazies at Duke
University. At Duke, no one
notices one or two vocal fans,
because they are surrounded by
equally vocal fans.

The Crazy Cats will have a
marked off section in Belk
Arena. Burt and Beach hope this
strength in numbers can come to
Davidson. They believe that
studénits Will be able to let’ out all
their aggressions at the games.

Burt and Joe do not feel that
the spirit level was sufficient in
the last couple of years and want
the intensity to pick up, because
the prospects for both Davidson
Basketball teams looks good.
The spirit from the fans will spill

over onto the playing floor to
elevate the levels of playing by
the teams even higher.

Burt and Beach planto |
organize trips to away basketball
games in the area and then
culminate the season with a
victorious trip to the Southern
Conference Tournament. They
hope to organize a trip to the
NCAA Tournament at the end of
the year as well: °°"

Anyone interested in helping
the club get started or signing up
for the club are encouraged to
give Burt or Beach a call, They
are eager to hear any ideas that
could improve the environment
for future Davidson Basketball
games.
