Laundry reports $1,000

in clothes stolen this year
Seven week figure already equals1987-88 total

By GARY WHEELER

~~ Almost $1,000 werth of clothing has dis-
appeared from the Davidson College laun-
dry already this year. Two bundles, one
worth $326 and the other $341, were re-
moved from the shelves by someone other
than the owners earlier this year. Both of
the bundles were processed on the same
date, and neither bag has been returned.

More recently, six shirts valued at $54

‘each were found missing from the racks.

Laundry Manager. Frances Beaver is sure
that both the two bundles and the six shirts
were labeled with the correct laundry
number, because duplicate tickets (record-
ing the weight of each laundry bag or the
number of shirts turned in to be washed and
ironed) kept by the staff matched the laun-
dry numbers of the three students.

The laundry service does not have insur-
ance, so students are compensated for lost
and stolen clothing from the laundry serv-

ice’s budget. This year’s budget sets aside
$1500 to pay for lost or stolen clothing.

This year’s disappearing laundry prob-
lem has been much worse than in years
past. Last year, $1051.69 was reimbursed
to students to cover missing clothing, but
that amount has almost been: equalled in
just seven weeks this year.

Beaver claims that it is not uncommon
for students to accidentally pick up the
wrong bundle, but these bundles are usu-
ally returned fairly quickly. If the bundles
are not returned, Beaver says that not only
does it create a great deal of expense for the
laundry service but it also inconveniences
the students who must get by without their
lost clothes.

Beaver does not feel that she needs to
change the system by which students pick
up their clothes. “That’s the way it has
always been and that’s the way we want to
keep it,” she says.

‘Trustees discuss wide range i. issues in meeting

“Philosophy of Service” approved, athletics, arts complex included in deliberations

By TRIPP HELMS
Davidson’s Board of Trustees
convened here October 6 for their
annual fall meeting. The main
business of the meeting was cen-
tered around the discussion of

issues brought up in the previous .

winter and spring meetings of the
board.

Issues included were the ath-
letic program, the major fundrais-
ing campaign, the college’s com-
mitment to service and the col-
lege building program.

No major policy changes were
. made with regard to the athletic
program. Trustees were given a

full report on the stipulations of ©

Title 9, a NCAA regulation man-

dating equitable funding for

men’s and women’s sports.

The trustees made no official
changes in the athletic program’s
budget, but “recognized the need
to address the issue” and will do
so more Officially in the February
meeting, according to President

- John Kuykendall.

Davidson is still looking for an _

with the Colonial Athletic Asso-
ciation still a possibility. Kuyken-
dall, along with Athletic Director
Kit Morris, continues to pursue
this and is planning to meet with
the college presidents affiliated
with the CAA this fall.

In response to SGA President
Harrison Murray’s appeal to the
committee for more intramural
and club sports fields, the Trus-
tees expressed concern that provi-
sions be made for these fields,

. says Kuykendall.

Any additional budget money
for such fields will be allocated at
this February’s budget meeting.

The trustees also approved the
issuance of a formal apology to

those students displaced this fall -

by the delay in dorm building
schedules.

Plans for the college’ s major
fundraising campaign were dis-
cussed, according to Kuykendall,

~buta specific ‘goal-was not set.

A resolution was passed which
stated, “the Trustees of Davidson
College affirm that $160 million
in new resources are required in

order to accomplish strategic
needs by the 1993-94 academic
year; and set as items for action at
’ their February, 1989, meeting (1)
the authorization of a “Campaign
for Davidson” and (2) the setting
of an appropriate goal for the
Campaign to be concluded by the
1993-1994 academic year.”

The College “Statement of the
PHILOSOPHY OF SERVICE”
was approved with some minor
changes by. the board.

The statement, printed in full
below, asserts that “education
should encompass more than aca-

demic excellence” and that. “stu-
dents should be prepared to serve
their communities--local,
gional, national, and interna
tional.”

The . Buildings and Grounds
committee heard a report from

- Dober and Associates, an archi-

tectural consulting firm, on the
campus long range building plan.
Graham Gund and Associates
presented some plans for a new
fine arts center for Davidson.
According to Kuykendall, the
plans were preliminary and a

more finalized version will

be looked at in a later meeting.

The meeting was presided over
by Vice-Chairman of the Board
Craig Wall in the absence of the
chair, the recently deceased Ben
Craig. Wall is now acting chair-
man. Kuykendall says that the
board will choose its new chair in
the February meeting.

The late Craig -was elected to
the board by the Mecklenburg
Presbytery. It will choose a new
representative also to be installed
in February unless, Kuykendall
says, “circumstances require
someone before that time.”
