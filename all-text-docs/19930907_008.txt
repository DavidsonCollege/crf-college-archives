Feuer: A Davidson education in the real world

By Alex Crumbley

This summer America wit-
nessed the suicide of the Clintons’
deputy legal counsel Vince Foster,
a Davidson graduate and distin-
guished Arkansas lawyer. Reports
indicate that the pressure and re-
lentless warfare of Washington

politics drove him to his death and —

that the media and partisan attacks
on the Clinton administration were
just too much for him. :

The exact circumstances sur-
rounding his death may forever be
unknown, but the terrible fact of
Washington’sslanderous and ruth-
less political climate, a climate tur-
bulent enough to drive a man to
take his own life, is something
which anyone can see. .

Some of us may feel a kinship
with Foster simply because he went
to Davidson, but our sympathies
should lie deeper than that. Foster’s

disillusionment and death should
not only sadden us but alarm us as
U.S. citizens whose government
has strayed far away from the prin-
ciples which were meant to guide
it. Itshould also raise an important
question for all of us: how broad is
the gulf between the idealism which
liberal arts schools like Davidson
teach us and the harsh reality of the
outside world?

Idealism is inextricably inter-
twined with a liberal arts educa-
tion. At Davidson we learn to act
with honor, we study philosophers
concerned with the best mankind
can accomplish, and we learn to
live together in an atmosphere of
trust and respect. Foster and I
heard the same Honor Code pre-
sentation when we were freshmen.
Like many ofus, he probably satin
a humanities or an ethics class one
day and promised himself that he

would leave Davidson and try to
make the world a better place.
Foster most likely left
Davidson with the same high ide-
als that Davidson instills in mostof
its students. After Davidson, he
graduated first in his class from

law school at the University of
Arkansas and became a prominent

Little Rock lawyer.

A little later in his life, he was
presented with an opportunity most
of us will never be lucky enoughto
have. A boyhood friend of: his
became President, and Foster sud-
denly had the chance to travel to
Washington and make a real dif-
ference.

But Washington crushed him.
The media hounds, accusing him
of dishonesty and corruption, tried
to defame his character and drag
his name through the mud like it
does all national figures. I see a

man like Foster drown in the
Washington’s stormy sea of accu-
sations, rumor-spreading, and de-
ceit, and I wonder how many ofus,
having come of age in the same
environment as he, would react in
the same situation.

Other factors may have con-
tributed to his suicide, but the fact
is that Washington drives many
honest, altruistic spirits away be-
cause they cannot handle the in-
sidiousness involved in national
politics.

Has idealism become obso-
lete? Kennedy and Carter were
our last two presidents who were
seen as idealistic. Kennedy was
killed after three years in office,
and Carter was defeated in 1980,
heavily ridiculed for his unrealis-
tic goals like decreasing nuclear
weapon production. Bush belittled
the Democratic party’s agenda last

year by callingit “the vision thing.”
It seems that our society now dis-
misses ideals as something about
as useful to us out of the classroom
as calculus.

A country without leaders of
vision is like a ship without a cap-
tain.

Washington has become so ©
destructive that we have fewer and
fewer captains who are willing to
suffer the slings and arrows of poli-
tics to help guide us in the right

_ direction.

It is our duty as liberally edu-
cated citizens and future public
servants to put some ideals, espe-
cially integrity, back into the fore-
front of our national conscious-
ness and make Washington a more
temperate place for people who,

_ like Vince Foster, cannot compro-'

mise their principles forthe sake of
political expediency.

Semester in Exile... Chris Frampton

Holy Moses! He's back

By Chris Frampton

Davidson College is facing a .

crisis that threatens to hit at the
heart of the very foundations of its
being. A crisis of epic proportions
looms large on the horizon, and the
student body must take steps now
to find a way to deal with the
emotional trauma that is sure to
result.

Counseling centers must be
set up. A 24-hour suicide hotline
must be opened. Classes should
spend time focusing simply on the
- questions that will surely arise from
what must now be told. I can delay
no longer in relaying what will
surely send the huddled Davidson
masses heading for the beer cool-
ers and old bottles of rum. I must
tell you what has already passed,
with unanimous approval in a
small, hidden, batcave in Cham-
bers.

The Executive Committee has
made a decision that will surely
affect all of those who have had
any contact, no matter how mini-
mal, with this once illustrious
school.

They kicked my butt out.

Now calm down. It will be
OK. And there is an upside: I now
will be able to write a weekly opin-
ion column full of insight into im-
portant aspects of our student life
at this once illustrious college.

(Freshmen: you do not know

wholam. Well, some of the girls
do but we’re not running pictures
of ourselves this week so you think
my nameis Howdy Coonley. Any-
way, you will know, but part of
becoming a real Davidson person
is to get past being a little puny
punk with no clue what’s going or
where you are or how to gotosleep
without your mother singing Guar
songs in a soft, comforting, oedi-
pal sort of way.)

Part of the unbelievably mo-
ronic reasoning behind my “Se-

mester Off” is that I must suffer the’

consequences of my actions. This
means that I must have done some-
thing wrong so I figured I’d hand
out some advice. Hopefully this

can help everyone, not just fresh-
men, for I have certainly been a
perfect student during my tenure
in Davidson.

Tip #1: If you have a test (I
don’t use the word review because
a review is what you do before you
take a test. According to this
Davidson word you must take a
test to get ready for areview which
is stupid, stupid head) go to the
refrigerator and get a few twelves
of Milwaukee’s Best Light and
guzzle, shotgun, funnel, beer bong,
inject, or bath in their contents.

_ The result will be a light
headed feeling that tends to en-
courage you to head into some girl
or guy’sroom where you do things
you probably shouldn’t. In the
morning you wake up with your
arm stuck under whoever youslept
with and start to feel like a coyote
in atrap. You'd rather gnaw off
your arm than wake up the person
laying on it.

Now I know you are wonder-
ing, “If1am drunk won’tI perform
poorly on this incredibly interest-
ing Spanish test I have to take to
graduate from this once illustrious
college?” The answer is, quite
obviously, “No.” If you just stay
drunk, you’ll do fine.

Tip #2: Class is overrated. If
you go to class, you will just be
bored. Class is not important, what
is important is to sleep. Get plenty
even if it means you have 47 ab-
sences. You can just say, “Dad, I
need sleep to do well.”

Tip #3: I’m sick of trying to
come up with tips.

Listen, the most important
thing to remember to do is fulfill
all requirements the college has. If
they say “DIG!” Just answer,
“Where to?”

-In the future, I’ll give more
advice, so if you have any ques-
tions, just write to me at P.O. Box
219, Davidson, NC, 28036. Or
just bring a letter by the
Davidsonian office which is hid-
den in the catacombs of torture in
the Union. Thanks for your time
and take your core requirements.

A few words from the National
Freshmen Awareness Seminar

By Tony Tuntasit

I was looking for my 12¢ Bic
Rollerball pen when my music pro-
fessor walked in, grumbled, and
then proceeded to explain to the
class that it was a Davidson tradi-
tion to applaud the professor wildly
when he first set foot in the class.
He left and seconds later returned.

Suddenly, several guys actu-
ally got up and gave the man a
standing ovation complete with,
clapping, circular hand gesticula-
tions; foot stomping and several
“QOOOHGAH!!!”s.

And while these transients
from Arsenio’s DOG POUND
were cheering, my friends and I
could only roll our eyes, shake our
heads in disbelief and share a soli-
tary thought, “Boy, the freshman
class sure is big.”

Actually, I laud their enthusi-
asm. While it lasts.

Freshmen face many problems
when entering college, ranging
from homesickness (bad food),
teachers with nicknames like
“Smiling F,” acne (bad food), as-

.-tranomical phone bills ($163.14), ...

the unadulterated freedom to

shower every fourth Sabbath and,
of course, the fact that they look
like freshmen.

At the National Freshman
Awareness Seminar the top ques-
tion asked by freshmen was the
question that boggled even good

"Just be cool. . esas

may vary."

old Einstein, “How do we keep the
upperclassmen from figuring out
that we’re freshmen?”

EINSTEIN: Eine
vitternrbraue nincomputen
beskenbraken fraulespeken. YUK!
YUK! YUK!.

Translation: I don’t know be-
cause I was never went to college
and never had to be a goony fresh-
man. HA! HA! HA!

Actually, thisis avery serious
issue amongst freshmen. The Na-
tional College Magazine says that
in order to assimilate better into
the college environment a fresh-

man should take, the, following

steps:

1. Don’t wear high school
memorabilia like the letterman
jacket, the gold plated class ring,
the “1993 Des Moines High School
Monster Truck Quilting Bee Cham-
pion” T-shirt or anything else that
might indicate that you just stepped
off the secondary school bus. ©

2. Ask several questions in
class even if they seem silly. For
example: “Is Biology 113 a re-
quirement for pre-med?," “Could
you repeat that last thought about
Nasal Glands?," “We liveon Earth,

- right?”

3. Just be cool. Results may
vary, though. _

But life has gotten a lot easier
for freshmen here at Davidson. A
few years ago a freshman had to
endure things like freshmen ID
Tags, the Davidson Beanie, haz-
ing, and of coyrse the big ol’ Con-
duct List of Freshmen Regulations.
These rules (1920-1969) were
made to make sure the Freshmen
remember that they’re still just a
bunch of buttheads.

Rule#1. Freshmen must know
