Dr. Mott’s ‘Lectures

Today marked the clase of a series of lec-
tures by one of the most outstanding men
in the Christian world. and in the world at
large. Dr. John R. Mott has throughout his
long and useful life spoken continually to
various groups of students in ail parts of
the world—at over three thousand individ-
ual colleges and universities, te be more
specific. Davidson has indeed been honored
by -his presence on the campus. :

It is a rare thing that a student body has
the opportunity to listen to such a man as
this, Men of his caliber are few ‘and far
between, and the college has been fortunate
in being able to secuce Dr. Mott for lec-
tures. Once again the Otts Lectureship
has performed a fine service to the college.
and the thanks of the student body go to
the. donor, as well as to Dr. Mott, who has
given a fine, inspiring series of lectures.

A’ prominent senior was heard to say
recently, in discussing the Mott lectures,
“If 1 had my life to live over at Davidson.
I would make it a point to attend every
lecture presented by the college.”

Looking back over the many lectures
that have been given in Chambers Audi-
torium the past three years, it is amazing
how wide a variety of various Gelds of hu-
man.endeavor have been presented For.
instance: there has been a talk on necrom-
ancy, polaroid, Biblical research in Pales-_ |
tine, General Alienby'’s campaign, the new
approach to physieal research. and) many
other subjeets. Among the distinguished
visitors to our eampus have been Carl Sand-
' burg, Maurice ‘Hindus, No Yong Park. and
récently Dr. Mott. . _

When a new lecture’ is announced in_
chapel. the average student usually -hides -
a “ho-hum” behind an upraised palm, and
‘wonders what is on at the show. But never
in later life will he have the opportunities
which are before him at Davidson to hea

discussed the subjects in whieh everyone |

should be interested, by widely known and
recognized authorities. JAnd it is refresh-
ing to note that at least some upper class-
men see fit to bewail the chances which
they have lost forever to know more} of—
what. is going on in the world. We.can.
only hope that more students can be made
to see the value of our lectures eatly enough ,
in their college life so that they can get
the benefit to be derived from them. ~

_ Glass shattered, water swished, horrify-

thought of our damage fees tlecing away in
a water ftght that was being carried on in
the twne of “Burn Rumple.” Often these
affairs Suarted as mere little rallies that
had good intentions of getting the students

much damage to college property that they
had to “shell owt” a smalt fortune. Alas!
the desired results were never gained. How-
ever, this year we have come to a turning
--point in the relations between the faculty |
rand the students on subjeets that the stuz—
dents want considered in their behalf.

An interesting pictorial concep-
tion of speed is offered by The
Travelers [Insurance Company in
its latest highway safety booklet
entitled “Death Begins “at_ 40.”|
Speed is pictured in terms of
“rollability.”

For instance, at 25 miles an
hour, a moving car has developed
about enough energy to roll over
once. Your body probably could

Last year when the student faculty com-
mittee was organized the feciing among the

students seemed to be that it was just a
measure to put off the question of the cuts
which at that time had just been reduced
to almast half their former numbér and that

“take” this.

At 50 miles an hour, however, a
moving car has developed not
twice, but four times the energy—
enough to roll over four times.

When You’re ROLLE ALONE
Think About QOLUING oveps/| --

75 Miles an Hour

You'd have to be lucky to come
out of this one alive.

And at 75 miles per hour, the
car has developed not three times,
but ‘nine times the energy —
enough to roll over nine times. Of
course, it probably would hit a
tree or a culvert long before it
did its ninth somersault and then
the unused portion of energy
would be spent in ripping the cul-
vert, the car, and its occupants to
Pieces. ‘

The moral: When you are-roH~=
ing along at a pretty fast clip, think
what would happen if you should
roll over. ws

it would be a group of students that would
appeal to the faculty in behalf of the stu-
dent body with no good results. However,

Letters To The Editor

soon in this school year we saw that any
one that had had this idea about the com- be ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION
mittee was badly mistaken, for right away | Dear Andy:

tions concerning the double cuts before and

vestigating the thing a little and
after the holidays. those connected with it apparently

know no reason why this office has
been so’ abruptly discontinued or
just who did discontinue it?

Apparently the change in the
Athletic —Department of the Col-
Jtege made by the Board of Trustees
at their February meeting instigat-
ed this move but why should we kill
this office because of the Trustees
action?

Under the old sct-up there were
two distinct Athletic Associations—.
the College's and the Students. The
Davidson AA of course took care
of aH Athictic work and duties;
the Student AA was merely an hoii-
orary set-up and had no connection
whatsoever. with the Davidson AA.
It served merely as a means to
honor several of our athletes who/
would not otherwise gain recogni-
tion for their services. Their capaci-
ty included nothing official; their
duties. were none; the organization
merely existed.

-Why then_ should we destroy an
office because of a new department
put in by the college authorities?
Our student AA will not interfere
with the new college set-up. [t'll
only exist as it did in the past—|
for the purpose of recognizing three
athletes and naming them to three
offices, the president, vice-president,
and secretary-treasurer of the Stu-
dent AA.

Now again we find that the committec
has worked out another change in the cuts,
appreciated by them.

AN of this ean mean but one thing and
that-is we have at last found a way in
which we can present our side of vital ques-
tions to the faculty and work these things
out to the best advantage to both parties
in the question.

-— The committee has found, I’m quite sure,
in their dealings with them that the faculty
is interested in the students and that they
want to help us get the things that we want
most if only the students will go about it in
the right way. This fact has been definitely

‘proved and now if we will all stay behtved
this group that has worked so diligently for
us and pull with them for the things that
we teel will be.an asset to the campus it
will be amazing to see the headway we can
make. a : ~

FOOD FOR THOUGHT

Ye olde author waxes bold here.—_Now
that he has gotten on this subject of
changes, he has one little thing that he
would like to see made a part of the regu-
lar activities here each year. It is a very
evident fact that there is much friendly
rivalry between the classes, so why- not
each year have an annual mud, water, or
what_have_you, battle between, say, the
freshnien and juniors vs. the sophomores
“and seniors? This is an idea that has been
successful in many schools, supervised by
the intramural staff. It might work here
at Davidson, until we try how shall we
know that it is not a good idea? \We cer-
tainly have boys here that love to engage
in battles of this type, as is shown ever so
often by the friendly water fights. How-
ever, some few boys have found these to
be rather expensive and we all have found__
that they are not the thing to create a feel-
ing of animosity with the faculty. So let’s
consider the assets of an annual inter-class |
“battle and if we think it would. be a good
thing why then our student-faculty commit-
tee can do what they think best about it.

DR. MOTT
Dear Andy: .

I would like to take this op-
portunity -to thank . Dr. -Mott—for
his wonderful talks during the past
week. Although. he may not see this,,
1 feel that the College should also
know that a great many of the
students appreciate ¢he value of
such things, and that a great many
more do also, even if they won't
admit it:

It just occurred to me that no
one might take the trouble publicly
to ‘thank Dr. Mott for his talks,
and the college for getting him,
and I'd like for someone to do_it,

Thoughts

» Another week and another guest
columnist. Glad to welcome Apie
back .to the campus.. I wish he
could write this column, but it will
take him a week or two to re-
establish his snooping contacts.

Last, week-end was filled with
quite a number of functions, the
Chi Omega hay-ride, the S. A. E.
dance, the S. P. E. danee, and the
O. R. A. ball. Quite a lot of dope
flowed back to the campus from
these affairs. . ,

The feature of the O. R. A. ball
was the blaring band of blacks
which kept the crowd continually
on the jump. Rea Tenney had an
appointment with Colonel Steele
for 12:20, but due to unforseen cir-
cumstances he didn’t keep it. Hope
he doesn't get court martialed. On-
ly about half-of the ROTC boys
attended but there were no uni-
forms left on the campus. Many
new Davidson Army ‘boys were
present. The locker room was the
scene_of_ mulifoliate action. Among
the big noises were Luther, Bark-
er, Anderson, ete. And speaking
of Barker, I learned after return-
ing to the campus that he, Vernon

Youngblood, and several others took

a long detour home by Concord
after the dance. Butch and her
visitors—were among the notables
present. We are sorry that Major
Ballard and Lt. Col. McKenzie were
unable to attend, Thanks a million
to the Charlotte Reserve Officer's
Association for a fine affair.

The Chi Omega

hay-ride was.

another of the week-end successes.
Everyone: was distinctly shocked
when Warren Lewdlam turned out
with Loch Hunter's old flame,
Weenie Shelley. Ed Watkins al-
most, broke his’ leg when he fell
through a rotten plank in the old
haunted house. Mary Payne must
have been chasing him. Mary told
the simplest joke of the evening:
“What did the Ist Wall say to the
2nd Wall? Don’t lean on me; [’m
plastered, too.” Ralph Monger, Bilt
Bolin, Doug Dillard, Charlie Mash-
burn, Julian Lokey, etc., were some
of the Davidson luminaries avho
helped fill the hay.

Why is Gene Sutton going around
with such a dejected look on his
face these days? Ans.: His babe
was at the S. P. E. dance with an-
other fellow. Sut had that help-
less attitude toward the whole thing.”
He should have better control over
his girls.

“Noxious Norman” Stevenson has
at. last become one of the big op-

erators of the campus. Phil Peytoi_.

says that last Saturday night's .ac-
tivities were all that Stevey needed
to raise him to “stardom.”

The S. A. E. dance at the Coun-
try Club was more or less of a
closed affair, at least to super-
snoopers. But I do know that Hay-
seed Thomas went around all night
introducing himself and date as
“Old Thomas, and Old Wilson; and
that’s all.”

v And that had better be ail
me.

Compassing The Campus

By TOM CAUBLE

The anecdote I am attempting to
recount_here has no very direct
connection to anything contempor-
ary local life—in short it is neither
open politics propaganda nor a shot
at the Old Guard. It is merely one
of_the innumerable legends or what-
have-you that Mr. Jackson so de-
lights in recalling. It is probable
even that its accuracy has been
dimmed by time for it occurred
during the cra of mustachioed und-

ergraduates and four-button coats.

It seems that back there some
where local politics were rolling
along quite smoothly under the
watchful eye of the conservative
Old Guard. No doubt they felt they
had things comfortably in hand
and would re-elect the same old
mayor who was a fixture of the
office. However, a bombshell was
tossed into theft tsleepy midst one
morning with the announcement
that a new party, had been formed
and was entering a candidate in
the mayoralty race. It seems that
the local rowdies, tired of domina-
tion by the clect of the community,

‘had~gotten together, prepared -a

ticket, and were offering the local
blackguard to the populace as the
next mayor. Naturally the most dis-
reputable chaps in town would sit
on the town council if he were
elected,

The Old Guard really began to
worry as the campaign waxed hot-
ter. Things very frankly looked
bad. The newly-formed liberals
would probably repeal the town
charter if they went in and it look-
ed. dangerously as if they would
outnumber the conservatives at the
polls. The liberals were no doubt

the rowdies at the polls. They
found there was no law preventing
students of voting age from casting
their ballots in local township elec-
tions for they resided here niné
months of the year.

Consequently the matter was tak-
en to the students and a plea made
in chapel for aid in fighting the
evil element and allowing righte-
ousness to triumph. Wild applause
greeted the appeal. The students
were. all for it. Every eligible man
pledged himself to vote.

Old Boys. They could settle down

history.
