Rev. C. F. Myers Speaks
At Vespers On Sunday

The Reverend Charles F. Myers,
[pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Greensboro, spoke at
Vespers Sunday night in the audi-
torium, taking as his text the twen-
ty-second verse *of the forty-ninth
chapter of Genesis: “Joseph is a
fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by
a fountain; His branches run over
the wall.” |

The prelude, played by James C.
Pfohl, was Widor's “Andante Can-
tabile,” following which was the
call to worship by Dr. Gwynn and

the invocation. The choir led in
the singing of “O Worship the
King, All Glorious Above” and

Psalm I was the scripture reading
chosen by Dr. Gwynn. The offering
was then taken and another hymn
sung.

Reverend Charles Myers is v-cll-
known to Davidson men and has
spoken many times before at the

a

school. Ils idea was to view the
whole subject of a jather’s » wish
fot his son, .a theme keynoted by
the prophecy of the dying Jacob,
as, with his sons gathered around
him, he expressed his hopes and
indicated to them what Gad had
allowed him to see concerning their
earthly future. Joseph, called the
dreamer, was his father's favorite;
“his father loved him more because
he loved his father more,” said Dr.
Myers. And Jacob's deathbed. wish
for his. favorite son Joseph is every
father’s wish for his son today. he
said—that he might also be a
“fruitful bough” and take a posi-
tion of eminence in the world’s af-
fairs, always provided le: might
have internal peace, peace of mind
and of soul (that sometimes does
not go hand in hand with material
success). In addition to success

No Decisions Given For Inter-
esting Forensic Contests

Wade Boggs and Tyler Port
returned irom the southern de-
bating tour Friday. March 6,
after having to cancel a mect-

University because of unex-
pected delay in transportation.

During this trip the Davidson de-
baters met teams from the Univer-
sity of South Carolina, the Univer-
sity of Florida. and the University
of Miami, but in none of these de-
bates was a decision given.

They met the South, Carolina
men on February 25, and, accord-
ing to the contract. there was to
have been a decision by three
judges. Instead, however. they
were offered an audience decision
which they refused, jt being against
the policy of Davidson debaters to
accept such decisions. Paul Harlan.
President of the Forensic Council,
who accompanied them on this trip,
said that, in his opinion, Boggs and
Port clearly out-debated their op-
pohents..

On February 28, they met the Un-
iversity of Florida at Gainesville, in
a ridio debate over Station WRUF.
On the 29th, they debated with men
from the University of Miami, be-
ing heard through an amplifier in
the Open Air Park of that city.
Harlan said that the debate with
Florida was close, but: that, in his
opinion the Miami representatives
were out-debated by the Davidson
men,

The debate with Emory’ was
scheduled to be beld tomorrow,
March 12, but due to an unavoidable
delay, the meeting was cancelled.

The question in the three debates
was: “Resolved, that Congress
should be permitted to over-ride by
a two-thirds majority any five-four
decision of the Supreme Court de-
claring a law of Congress uncon-
stitutional.” A slight change had
been planned for the debate with
Emory whicli would have made the
last part of the @iestion read.”
ANY DECISION of the Supreme
Court 2..." rather-than " any
FIVE-FOUR- decision of the Su-
preme Court...” —_—

The Davidson team upheld the
affirmative of the question at the
University of South Carolina amd
the University of VHorida, and the
negative at the University of Mi-
ami, They were. also, to take the
negative ac Emory.
