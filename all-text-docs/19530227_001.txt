This is the sixteenth season that
Dr. Sevitzky has conducted the Or-
chestra. As a conductor, he is well-
known, both in this country and
abroad. Born on the continent in
1889, Sevitzky came to this coun-
try as a visitor some thirty years
ago, and liked it so well he decided
to remain. In addition to his love
for music, the conductor has one
of the biggest and most complete
private collections of fire arms in|
the country. He is also a first rate
amateur painter.

Dr. Sevitzky believes that. Amer
ica has come of age musically, con-
sequently, he wants Americans to
appreciate American music. To this
end he tries to include at least
one American composition in each
program he conducts.

The orchestra has been built
wisely and carefully, largely by Dr:
Sevitzky himself. It was organized
only twenty-three years ago, mak-
ing it the very youngest of the
leading orchestras.

The average age of the 85 in-
dividuals in the symphony is also
surprisingly. young. This is well ex-
emplified by the fact that the con-
certmaster is only 27 years old. His
name is Stanley Weiner, and
though short in years he is long
in experience, having served as con-
certmaster of the New York Sym-
phony several years ago. Included
in the orchestra’s number are elev-
en women.

Booth Tarkington in writing
about the symphony has said: “In
personnel as in its work, the or-

chestra is cosmopolitan; ‘but this

does not mean that it is not Ameri-
can. Descendants of every Euro-
pean race are among its member-
ship; but the Indiana audiences

YMCA Acquires
New Automobile

The Davidson YMCA will soon}
be sending its deputations to their |
destinations in a ‘53, four-door,
grey, Ford car.

The first week in March the Y
will trade in its '48 Chevrolet for
the new automobile: which will
serve the Christian organization as
| the old one did in the past. Deputa-
claim most of the time but it will
occassionally be pressed into serv-
ice on Y social week-ends.

The decision to replace the old
car was made by a special commit-
tee of the Y Board of Directors.
The committee was composed of
Bob Henry, Grier Martin, and Gene
Craven.

The Board of Directors has for
its overall purpose the general  di-
rection and guidance of the college
YMCA and this year its members
are: Dr.| Cunningham, Prof. Work-
man (chairman), Prof. Wilson, Prof.
Eberhardt, Treasurer Martin,
Moody Smith, Gene Craven, Bob
Henry, Herschel Allen, and Hubert
Cfnnon.

The Ford costs $1995, $885 of
which is accounted for by the trade-
in of the old car, and the remainder
has been allotted in the Y budget
for the year. The money was saved
from not having a chaplain this
year.

President of the Y, Hubert Can-
hon, in his announcement of the
new car, said that for the informa-
tion of those who would be using
the car there is a governor on it
which cuts the engine off at 60.

By CHARLES BURNETT

With a little more than a week
to go before the opening curtain,
the Red and Black Masquers’ cast
and crew are putting the finishing
touches on J. B. Priestly’s three act
comedy Laburnum Grove, which
will be given Friday and Saturday,
March 6th and 7th.

The play .concerns a little old
man and his rather strange an-
nouncement that his business deal-
ings aren't all they should be, that
is to say, there might be some
question of their legality.

Just how this announcement af-

spector from Scotland Yards adds
to the confusion and the ending
bears out the fact that this is, as
“An immoral
Comedy.”
