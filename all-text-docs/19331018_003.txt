Big Pep I Meeting
Precedes Duke Game

Mr. Johnson of Barium Springs
Expected to be Here

On Friday night, October 20, in prep-
aration for the Duke game the next
day, the biggest pep meeting of the
year excepting that before the Wake
Forest game will be held. The meet-
ing will begin at Shearer Hall at 7
o'clock, where the usual songs and
cheers will be given; and it is hoped
by Cheerleader Hawkins that Mr. Joe}
Johnston, of Barium Springs, one of
the most ardent and enthusiastic Wild-
cat supporters, will make a pep talk.
After the meeting at Shearer, a shirt-
tail parade will form and march over
the campus, and up and down the
highway. It will probably go by the
homes of several professors, who will
be asked to give pep talks. The pa-
rade will end in front of .Chambers
where more. yells will be given and
possibly someone will make another
talk.

Two Members Speak
To Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band held the first
of its bi-monthly meetings for Octo-
ber last Thursday evening at 9 o'clock
in the Social Center. The devotional
was led by A. M. Faison, following
which were two informal talks, one,
“The Place of Evangelism in the ae
istry,” by Don Brandon, and the other,
“Fellowship,” by T. D. Mullis. The
program for the evening ended in a
social hour of friendly chatter and re-
freshments. About twenty-five mem-
bers were in attendance.

The Southern Presbyterian Church
has sounded as its keynote for the
year, “Personal Evangelism at Home
and Abroad.” Choosing from this the
theme of his talk, Don Brandon ap- |
plied the principles of personal evan-
gelism in the life of the minister. He
introduced his topic by emphasizing
the importance and need for personal
evangelism both at home and abroad,
then developed his points according to
the three-fold standard of looking IN
to yourself, looking UP to God, and}
looking OUT to your fellowman for |
more consecration in the matter of
reaching men’s souls. T. D. Mullis
then brought the first part of the meet-
ing to a close with his talk on “Fel-
lowship.”

The officers for this year are: Her-
bert Lucas, president; Murphy Smith,
vice-president; W. A. Benfield, secre-
tary and treasurer.

Queens Is Forced to
Postpone Ibsen Play

The play, “The Master Builders,” by
Ibsen, sponsored by Queens-Chicora
College and scheduled there for Octo-
ber 14, was called off, according to an
announcement by Professor E. J. Er-
win Saturday morning, due to the sud-
den illness and complete nervous col-
lapse of the leading lady.

The day before it was to be pre-
sented at Queens-Chicora, the business
manager of the cast telephoned Pro-
fessor Erwin and stated that the re-
mainder of the tour had been post-
poned.

According to all recent reports, the
play was highly successful and would
have proved extremely popular to the
entire student body.

Rare Coin Collection

Will Be Exhibited

A collection of rare and foreign coins
and bank notes will be opened in the
reading room of the library on Fri-
day of this week. This numistratic col-
lection will inaugurate the new exhi-
bition case, for which, from time to
time, new collections of interesting ob-
jects will be arranged.

Eighteenth century American coins,
pieces—of—eight,—-and queerly shaped
oriental coins will add glamour to the
array. Both townspeople and faculty
members are co-operating by lending
samples from their private collections.
An excellent assortment of American
fifty cent pieces, including the chief
commemoration coins, collected for
many years by Mr. Thompson, cashier
of the Davidson bank, will be on dis-
play. Mr. Kimbrough is lending his
unusual collection of early American
coins. Particularly appropriate at this
time, when proponents and opponents
of inflation are fighting a bitter battle
in this country, is the complete assort-
ment of German inflation money, from
one mark to five billion mark notes.
They give a silent but forceful narra-
tion of the course of uncontrolled in-
flation in Germany ten years ago. Un-
usual coins from India, Siam, China,
