1798 MORALITY
Melville's play pjts Virtue against Evil.

‘Very Impressed’

A REVIEW
By BOB CUNNINGHAM

“Billy Budd.’ one of the
strongest plays to be present-
ed at Davidson in years,
opened Wednesday night to
a small but. as it turned out.
very impressed audience.

A “morality play." “Billy
Budd” was adapted for stage
by Louis Coxe and Robert
Chapman and expertly re-
adapted to the Davidson
stage by Rupert Barber, di-
rector. Joe Gardner, who
plays Billy, also designed the
very realistic set. and Peter
Lutken as chief carpenter
did a good job in its construc-
tion.

The play's few weaknesses
are completely overshadow-
ed by several strong char
acterizations. the most im-
pressive of which is that of:
Captain Vere. played by Tim
Gailey. Gailey‘s fine acting
is the force which produces

Gardner has the difficult
task of portraying Virtue in
its innocent but fatal struggle
against Evil, embodied in
Claggart and played by Bill

their parts admirably and
provide a strong accentua-
tion to Gailey. who as captain
mediates between the two.

In addition, there is very
excellent characterization by

Jack Hartman, Lutken and

The play is realistic down
to its Irish and Cockney ac-

characterizations are believ-

Jackson uses a cage to pro-

use of a similar device in a

“Willmormus Rotamentrus.”’

The natural development of
this techninue seems to be

Thacker, one of the protes-
tors. ‘Our position is that a
person has to make a moral
decision when he talks to a
Navy recruiter and that we
ought to have Vietnam and

their recruiters so that the
necessity for a moral deci-

Navy Lt. Jerry Lawrence,
one of the recruiters, said he

he didn't mind having the

The peace group had been
evicted from the Union lobby
last week after they set up
a table near Marine recruit-

permitted to set up their
table in a room adjoining the

extensive negotiation with

| Dissent Stand

The following is the text of President Spen-
cer’s statement of Nov. 6 on dissent:
“I have been asked to state my position on

the matter of dissent.

“Because the academic community by its very
nature depends on the principle that reason
* rather than force is the means to decision and

change, it is essential that such a community

protect to the utmost the right of dissent. That is -
why I am thoroughly committed to the protection
of the right of every member of this college to
express disagreement in any lawful, reasonable

“By the same token, the greatest threats to
the right of dissent come from the repudiation of
reason in favor of force, from the invasion of the
rights and freedom of those with whom we dis-
agree, and from the disruption of the constitu-
tional process through which dissent can be ex-~
pressed. Because such actions undermine the very
foundation on which the community is based,
their seriousness can hardly be overestimated.

“For this reason, membership in the college
community must be limited to those who respect
the rights of all and are willing to live and work
within a constitutionally ordered framework. In

my opinion, therefore, immediate suspension from

a

the college would be fully warranted in the case
of any student who by overt action, intimidation,

: or in any other way infringes the rights and free-
- dom of others; who disrupts in any way the nor-
mal processes or activities of any part of the col-
lege; or wilifully refuses to obey a lawful order
4 of constituted college authority.”

Stir Over VoluntaryROTC
Part Of Long Controversy

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

The student Senate's cal!
for voluntary ROTC Tuesday
night is only the latest in a
series of attacks that have
dogged Davidson's compul-
sory ROTC program in recent
years, |

But in spite of sporadic
demonstrations and occasion-
al. voices of opposition. the
compulsory program has con-
tinued to thrive. A significant
percentage of upperclassmen
have elected to enter the ad-
vanced program over the last
few years, and last spring
the Board of Trustees re-
jected a recommendation for
a voluntary program from
the Blue Sky Committee that
was seconded by the faculty

Food Service Critique
Suggests Improvements

By JOE SMITH
Staff Writer

After years of complaints,
both public and private.
about its various facets, a
report has finally been taken
on Davidson's food service.

A committee, chaired by
Union Board members Clay
Edwards and including Tom
Allison, Bill Smythe (both
members of the board), John
Reisner and Sterling Aber-
nathy, has prepared a 10-
Page report with the stated
purpose *‘ . . . to outline
what the students want as.an
ideal (food service) while at
the same time gathering the
main complaints and sug-
gestions that they have con-
cernin the present set-up."

The report goes on to ad-
mit that its suggestions are
based solely on ‘‘ideais”, no
economic or administrative
research having been done.

The committee's sugges-
tions deal individually with
the three major facets of
Davidson's food service:

(1) The snack bar -—- The
committee criticizes this
year's change to machines.
It recommends the estab-
lishment of a new snack

bar, completely separate
from the cafeteria serving
tine. This facility would
operate from just after
breakfast until the Union's
closing time and would
have a greatly expanded
menu.

(2) Catering service -- This
section deals with the food
service's handling of spec-
ial affairs (banquets,
early breakfasts on week-
ends, etc.). The report re-
commends the creation of
a private dining facility,
open to the public at all
times. It also recommends
increased incidental. food
service and ingenuity in
the catering area.

(3) The cafeteria — While
praising the quality of food,
efficiency of service, and
general administration of
the cafeteria, the report
criticizes, among other
things, its lack of menu
variety, inequity of meal
prices, lack of atmosphere,
and lack of channels for
complaint.

Its recommendations in-
clude: regular evaluation
of meal service by some-
one representing the col-
lege, an increase in ‘‘spec-
ial d@inners’’ (Halloween
Night,’ “Oriental N:ght'',
etc.). increased variety of
food, and fountain soft
drinks at each meal.
Union Board President Ed

Embree said that the report

was discussed and adopted by

the full board on Oct. 28.

At that time, coples of the
recommendations for action

were sent to the three mem-
bers of the administration
who are responsible for food
service: Union Director C.
Shaw Smith, Dean of Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts, and
Business Manager’ Robert
Currie.

No further action has been
taken, said Embree, due to
the inability of the adminis-
tration members to meet and
discuss the matter.

Embree said that there will
be a continuing student fol-
low-up on the report in an
effort to get action.

last December.

The trustees’ action was
prompted in part by the con-
viction that making ROTC
voluntary would eventually
lead to the program's de-
mise, owing to a lack of par-
ticipants, and a DAVIDSON-
IAN poll of some 30 freshmen
last week indicated that this
would probably be the case.

Alt 30 freshmen said they
were in favor of a voluntary
program, but only five said
they would have taken ROTC
under those circumstances.

A minor compromise
adopted by the trustees when
they squelched the Blue Sky
recommendation last spring
allows incoming freshmen the
option of obtaining a letter
from their parents to excuse
them from taking ROTC, and
this year seven freshmen
used that option.

The trustees also decided
to give the two courses in
basic ROTC only half credit.
Students still receive full
credit from the two advanced
courses.

The opportunity offered
freshmen to opt out of the
program. is not really new.
Trustee President Walter L.
Lingle Jr. said last May
that the policy had also been
used by ,the college some
years ago. ‘He said he did
not know why it had been
abandoned.

The policy, which is actual-
ly not permitted in the na-
tional basic ROTC contract,
was implemented largely
through the efforts of Col.
Frederick B. Outlaw, profes-
sor of military science.

... “most helpful’

helpful in getting the neces-
sary amendment," said Dean
of Students Richard C. Burts
Jr. “I am sure that without
his help, we would not have
been able to do this this
year.”

The government in effect .
waived a clause which states
that changes in the contract
can be made only with one
academic year's notice.

A number of students this
fall have charged that in-
coming freshmen were not .
properly informed of their
opportunity to opt out of
ROTC.

They were informed
through two statements In the
Wildcat Handbook, one argu-
ing against the program and
one for it, and through two
letters, one from the ROTC
Department itself and one
from the office of the dean
of students.

The statement in the letter
from the dean read: “If a
student's parents feel strong
ly that their son should not
take military training at Da-
vidson College they may
make a specific statement
to this effect and request
that the student be excused
by the dean of the faculty.”

The letter must be signed
by the student and his par-
ents. It does not require a
classification as a conscien-
tious objector, nor does it
require the parents to out-
line their reasons for their
objections.

The new “policy has led to
some complaints from sopho-
mores that thev did not have
this option this year. How-
ever, the basic contract,
which does not allow this op-
tion, is still in effect for up-
perclassmeh.

Upperclassmen can only be
excused from ROTC by phy-
sical disqualification, by reg-
Istering as a conscientious ob-
Jector or by virtue of previous
milltery service.
