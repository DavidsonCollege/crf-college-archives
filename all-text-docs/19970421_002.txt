Expansion of CatCard use two-and-a-half years away

At the April 15 SGA meeting Buster Burk announced that CatCards
will not see expanded use for several years. Paying at copiers and at
vending machines with CatCards will not become an option until the

SGA budget
confusing senate, ATC

By ANN CuLp
News Editor

In February, the SGA voted
itself an increase in the amount of
money it automatically receives
from the Activities Tax Council
(ATC), going from 4.3% to5%. On
Tuesday, the SGA decided to ‘sub-
mit its own budget —at less than 5%.

“The SGA was constantly ex-
ceeding the 4.3%, and we thought
that 5% would be reasonable and
meet our needs, The Student Ex-
ecutive Council [SEC] decided that
SGA didn’t need that much money,
though. The percentage is really
superfluous. We can get however
much money we want because we
pass the budget,” says SGA Chan-
_ cellor Joslyn Ogden.

The ATC determines how
much money chartered organiza-
tions are allocated. Its figures are
presented to SGA which approves
the budget with a majority vote.
Because the SEC submitted a bud-
get that was not automatically 5%,
it must be approved by the SGA
with a two-thirds vote.

“Technically, I didn’t have to
prepare a budget,” says SGA Presi-

dent Buster Burk. “But personally
for me and the rest of the adminis-
tration, I think that would have been
an insult to the ATC, and I was
interested in their recommendations.
It was kind of a nice gesture to ATC
and the student body that we didn’t
need the money.”

Although the ATCs allocations
must be approved by the SGA, Burk
intended for the SGA to “‘act like a
model organization” for chartered
organizations when he presented
his budget.

“The ATC is below the SGA.
We can have any budget we want,
it’s really all our money,” says Burk.

SGA By-Laws and Charters

‘Committee chair sophomore
Jonathan Sipling best summed up

’ the ATC’s role for the SGA. “It is
an institute of convenience to help
the SGA distribute its money.”

It has been puzzling to have
SGA negate its automatic 5% privi-
lege, which the SGA created for

itself, and submit a budget that SGA :

approves.

“They [SGA and ATC] are not
two seperate bodies, so there is go-
ing to be confusion,” says sopho-
more Conner Eldridge.

Snow reigns on return

Tony Snow ’77, one of
Washington’s newest and foremost
political pundits, came to campus
this weekend to present the Charles
Lloyd Award for non-fiction prose
and to attend his reunion.

Snow is the host of “Fox News
Sunday,” an editorial contributor
for U.S.A. Today, and a former chief
speechwriter for President George
Bush.

Inthe category of formal/schol-
arly essay, Cintra Pollack won first
place and Geordie Schimmel took
second. In the category of infor-
mal/personal essay, Ned Erickson
was awarded first place and Lisa
Senneff second. Snow judged both
categories.

Snow then talked about the
“Washington Scene.”

He characterized Washington
generally as a “as a brutal town
where you can not take friendship
personally.” He stated that
Washington’s importance in origi-
nating national initiatives might be
waning.

“The states have been the ex-
emplars of welfare reform and new
ideas. Washington is a lagging in-
dicator. Itis no longer a place where
ideas are hatched,” he said.

Along those lines, he tried to
explain that nothing was going on
in Washington because of an inter-
play of strange personalities, and
because both parties are in a period
of necessary revision and introspec-
tion to’make their ideas more in
tune with the electorate.

“The two parties are sparring

to find out what the future needs to
be. They have some mountains to
climb. We should expect a period
of inspired and comical chaos,” he
said.

Snow says that President
Clinton “is a compelling politician,
but one who thinks no risk is too
dumb.”

He criticized the “small”
agenda the President has taken up,
such as safer car air bags. “The
President has decided to lead by not
leading,” he said.

He also critiqued Speaker of
the House Newt Gingrich. Snow
praised Gingrich’s accomplish-
ments, but stated he does have some
awkward problems. ‘“‘Newthas never
had an unexpressed thought.

He was a compelling leader of
a revolution two years ago, who is
now figuring out how he wants to
lead,” he said. Overall, Snow hopes
that politicians once again learn that
“politics is a matter of building trust
in increments. People followed
along because that was the general
consensus of how things were
done.”

Union Reunion reflects on
storied past, exciting future

Davidson alumni and current
students were invited to a celebra-
tion this weekend in honor of the
Union’s 45th birthday, as partici-
pants in the Union Reunion cel-
ebrated the Union’ s past and learned
about its future.

William Brown, director of the
Union, hopes that the event was ‘“‘a
really wonderful time for people
who have had special experiences
at the Union to get together, remi-
nisce, meet people who have done
the same kinds of things they have,
celebrate, and talk about our hopes
and dreams for the future.”

Brown also stressed that the
events were inclusive.

“Current

students can come and go through
the events without feeling that it is
all or nothing. We invited 200
students who are current or former
Union Board members and student
employees. Anyone is welcome to
come who identifies himself as part
of the Union family,” he says.

The reunion kicked off on Fri-
day afternoon with a frisbee golf
tournament on Richardson Plaza.

Frisbee golf tournaments,
which have not been held in several
years, are a Union tradition.

The course for the current tour-
nament was the same course used
12 years ago. Following the golf
tournament, a Friday Afternoon
Club Reception was held featuring
magic performed by Bobby Halk

SGA Day time
for reflection

By ALLIson DoLpH
Staff Writer

Hotdogs and hamburgers
were served to students and fac-
ulty on the Union Patio as part of
the fourth annual SGA day on
Wednesday. :

The purpose of SGA Day is
to bring faculty, students, and staff
together.

In return for the free food,
students filled out surveys which
included sign-ups for SGA com-
mittees, schedules to drive as part
of the Rides Program, and sur-
veys of classes. From the sur-
veys, the Council on Academic
Affairs will compile a booklet of
student rankings to help guide
course selection.

SGA President Buster Burk
took a few minutes to reflect on
the direction of his young
adminstration as he dished out
burgers and dogs.

He’ mentioned as accom-
plishments conducting a priori-
ties poll, chartering everyone (in-
cluding the Intervarsity Christian
Fellowship), chairing all the com-
mittees, and refining the new
Rides Program.

Burk is looking into plans
for a campus playground, which
he will soon present to all College
committees.

“The new SGA administra-
tion has devoted a few weeks to
completing the transition from
the former administration,” says
Burk. “A leadership retreat for
SGA will be held this Saturday.”

Freshman Joslyn Ogden,
SGA Chancellor, shares Burk’s
enthusiasm for SGA Day and stu-
dent government. “Iam happy by
the number of students on SGA
Day signing up for committees,
which I consider essential to the
operation of the SGA,” says
Ogden. “I feel fortunate to have
the opportunity to learn more
about myself by working within
an established institution and serv-
ing the College community.”

That evening a Progressive
Dinner was held in the Union with
open-mike night for students and
alumni in the 900 Room.

Saturday morning, Union Re- -
union participants metto learn about
the future of the Union.

Brown and Tom Shandley,
dean of students, spoke about fu-
ture plans for the Union and un-
veiled a plaque dedicated to C. Shaw
Smith, Sr., the first director of the
Union.

That evening, Sam Spenser,
former Davidson College president
who oversaw much of the Union’s
development, spoke at the closing
banquet.

Following the banquet, The

Blue Dogs, featuring several mem-
bers of the Class of 1987, performed
at the Union Outpost.
' The Union Reunion was
planned by Union staff and by a
student committee chaired by Sara
Beth Hamlin.

About 175 people signed up to
participate, including 90 alumni and
several members of the Classes of
*87 and ‘88 who had helped orga-
nize the last Union Reunion.
