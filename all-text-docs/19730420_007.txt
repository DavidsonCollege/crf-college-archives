men who can never be
rehabilitated, that society can
do without.

“There is always a possibility
for them to escape, like that
man who escaped from a
meeting and raped a girl before
he was recaptured. He thinks
that capital punishment is
discriminatory, and said that 90
percent of the prisoners on
Death Row are black, and that a
good lawyer can get the ones
who can afford it out of
anything.

“The second policeman is for
legalization of marijuana. He
feels that if Paul Harvey and
Barry Goldwater condone it,
the time has come for it. He also
thinks that capital punishment
is discriminatory.

“The night I was with them,
there was an armed robbery at
all all-night store. a type of
Seven-Eleven. The manager
was shot in the leg. There was
also a robbery at the Golden

Eagle Motor Inn. and a speed

chase. We looked for an armed
robbery suspect.

“What was really amazing
was the suspect's discription
that I heard over the radio. He
was a black male. about 5° 10"
and 150 lbs.. dark clothes, full
beard. black hat with a bill and
possibly glass cuts on the lower
part of his trouser legs.

“I thought with a description
that concise it'd be easy to find
him, but at a raid we pulled
later there were at least a
dozen men who answered that
description.

Women’s athletics are in danger of disappearing

from the Furman campus, and the reason, as with
many organizations at Furman, is the apathy of the
students. Plagued by both poor turnout for the
existing teams and poor spectator support, the
women's program is failing and will lose its budget

unless the present trend is reversed.
The problem lies in two areas--in women in-
tercollegiate sports and in the intramural program.
Women's field hockey, gymnastics, and basketball
had barely enough participants to have a squad this
year, though the tennis and golf teams seemed to
have less trouble. Intramurals have failed because

loyalty.

Because of the problems in women’s sports, the
Furman Athletic Department is working on a plan to
form co-recreational intramurals. Badminton, tennis,
bowling, softball, volleyball, and swimming all lend
themselves well as co-rec teams. The co-rec season
could be carried on at the same time as the men’s in-
tramurals, and men who play intramurals for fun as
much as for pure competition could play in both the
co-rec and the regular men’s leagues. One person
commented, ‘‘To get most Furman girls interested in
something, there has to be the possibility of a date
lurking behind it.”’ If this observation is true, then
perhaps the co-rec league is the answer.

Two Davidson Seniors Win

Scholarships At Vanderbilt

By MARK DEATON
Asst. Managing Editor

Two Davidson College
seniors, Henry Jennings and
Mike Kelly. have been awarded
honorary scholarship grants to
pursue professional studies at
Vanderbilt University begin-
ning in fall, 1973.

Senior Mike Kelly has been
awarded a Patrick Wilson
Scholarship to study law at Van-
derbilt Law School.

The scholarship program.
founded by a prosperous Nash-
ville family intimately involved
in the law school. awards five
scholarships annually. The
$5000 annual stipend is awarded
solely on the basis of merit.

Also awarded a scholarship
grant for graduate work at Van-
derbilt was Davidson Senior
Henry Jennings, who is the
recipient of the prestigious
Justin Potter Medical Scholar-
ship.

Jennings’ scholarship also
totals $20,000, $5,000 annually
for four years, and like the
Wilson Scholarship, is awarded
on the basis of leadership poten-
tial in the respective field, in
society and academic ex-
cellence. _ ;

‘Winning this scholarship
obligates me to Vanderbilt Law
School,”’ said Kelly. “I couldn’t
be happier.

‘Ultimately this probably
means I will remain in the
South and practice law,”’ Kelly
indicated.

Fifteen finalists in the
scholarship competition spe
four days with the selection
committee i" Nashville. After
the interviews during (© days.
“The selection committee
wined and dined us and showed
us the Nashville city night life,”
said Kelly.

‘We had a chance to make
friends with the other can-
didates, get to know the selec-
tion committee members, the
faculty and staff, and scholars
there now.”’ Kelly indicated.

Kelly is the seventh Davidson
student to win a Patrick Wilson
Scholarship. As such, Davidson
students have been granted

more of them than have stu-
dents from any other school.
“They've shown that they're
interested in the kind of stu-
dents we've got here, and I'd
like to see more Davidson stu-
dents take advantage of the op-
portunity.” Kelly said.

Jennings is the third David-
son graduate to receive the
grant since it was founded in
1961. “I think that’s a tribute to
Davidson.” he said.

Like Kelly. Jennings plans to
remain in the South after his
graduation. He feels that one of
the objectives of the scholarship
committee is to aid in the
training of young professionals
who would seriously consider
practicing in the South, rather
than migrating to other parts of
the country.

“You have to be a resident of

Hymns, ’30’s Blues Mark

the South to be considered and
after that, I think they're
looking for men who show an in-
clination to stay south,’ Jen-
nings said.

Jennings also expressed a
willingness to see more David-
son pre-med students apply to
Vanderbilt in the future and ap-
ply for the scholarship as well.

“So many people here seem
to- lean too strongly toward
Duke and Bowman Gray or
their state schools. Davidson
graduates should think about
Vanderbilt—it's a fine Med
school and they seem to think
highly of us."" he said.

“I'm very fortunate to have
gotten the grant; I think Van-
derbilt is a fine school and I
hope to live up to the ex-
pectations of the Potter Foun-
dation,”’ Jennings concluded.

Deese Debut In Union

By VAL VAN HORN
Asst. Features Editor

Due to popular demand,
custodian/blues singer Fred
Deese made a debut in the
Union last Saturday.

Deese sang both choir hymns
and °30’s blues, including ‘‘Hey
Honey, Hey Babe.”

He held a flat tan book while
performing, and although he
riffled through it between num-
bers, Deese apparently was not

ar >t tha lyri
using it to check usc.)

Its primary purpose ap-
peared to be for Deese to beat
time with, which he did, along
with stomping both feet. The
audience at tinics “lapped along
with the songs, but mosi Cf the
time tapped time to Deese's
gutsy blues rhythm.

Packed though the Union
was, students continued to drift
in through the performance,
and either stood in the back
along the bar or sat on the floor
in front of the stage.

Deese “‘laid it.on™ the crowd.
Each song was greeted by en-

thusiastic applause, expecially

an epic, down-home, foot-
stompin’ number called ‘‘Baby
Let Me Lay It On You.”’

Also performed was a song
which Deese wrote himself 30
years ago, a coaxing blues
which didn't appear to have a
title.

Because not much time was
spent rehearsing, Deese and his
accompanist would pause bet-
ween each song to get their
respective vocal and guitar key
synchronized.

Becaus. “ot many songs hd
been scheduled, Deese uau .-
repeat some of his numbers
which appeared earlier in the
program. Despite these

drawbacks, the concert went
all
Wea.

Deese was given two standing
ovations and two encu., 2S: Only
one of which he accepted. Once
again, due to popular demand.
Deese will appear soon after he
has ‘studied up some” on his
songs.

Accompanying Deese were
Bob Long on guitar and Paul Ir-
win on harmonica.
