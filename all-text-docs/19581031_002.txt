Davidsonian Re-Affirms Confidence
In D. Grier Martin As President

Almost two weeks before the
Board of Trustees elected Grier Mar-
tin President of the College, the DA-
VIDSONIAN, in the issue of May 2,
1958. named him as the only man for
the job. On May 15, the date of his
election the DAVIDSONIAN had this
to say about the new President:

“The DAVIDSONIAN  congratu-
lates the Board of Trustees on its
choice of D. Grier Martin as the next
President of Davidson College. Mr.
Martin has proved during the past
six years, and especially this year,
that he has the ability, intelligence,
and affinity for forceful action that
will be needed during the coming
years, if Davidson is to realize its
real potential.”

Five months after his election our
attitude has not changed in the least.
except to gain assurance as the
months go by that the decision of the
Trustees was the best possible.

Perhaps it seems ridiculous to
mention again our attitude toward Mr.
Martin. However, conversations with
certain members of the Student Body
and Trustees have led us to believe
that some of our readers have mis-
construed criticism of various aspects
of Davidson as personal criticism of
Mr. Martin and his policies. Nothing
could be further from the truth. The
overcrowded conditions which greet-
ed as on our arrival at Davidson were
Done of the new President’s doings. °

In fact, he is on record as opposing
any further increase in the size of the
college. The faculty religious regula-
tions were written long before Ke was
born. and our weak departments have
been. weak far longer than five
months.

Only in the general sense that as
President of the College he is re-
sponsible for all phases of its opera-
tion is he responsible for these con-
ditions which we have attempted to
criticize. In this capacity. we have
every reason to believe that the study
which he is now applying to such mat-
ters will result in a sound. reasonable
program of ‘uprovement.

Every Trustee. student, parent,
and alumnus can rest assured that
Davidson is in the very best of hands.

The DAVIDSONIAN believes one
of its duties to be the pointing out of
existing problems and the suggestion
of possible solutions. Every editorial
is written with the full realization that
the magnitude of the problems dis-
cussed is such that every facet of them
cannot be squeezed into the space of
two columns.

Often in considering these ques-

_tions, we are relieved that no mem-

ber of this staff or of the Student
body, but a man of the maturity and
judgement of Mr. Martin is charged
with the ultimate decisions involved
in each.—W.L.W. & C.H.C.

Constitutional
Amendments

Today might well prove to be the
red letter day of 1958-1959 Davidson
College student government. Two pro-
posed amendments to the Student
Body constitution were presented.
about which much has been said with-
in the past year and particularly in
recent weeks.

The amendments concerning the
Honor Council and the firearms regu-
lation have been “chewed over” on
these pages too much for anything
vitally new to be added concerning
their content and purpose.

The Honor Council question poses
only one dilemma — not whether it
should be adopted but which of two
methods of nomination should be em-
ployed Several issues ago this paper
urged its readers to vote for nomina-
tion by a joint student-faculty commit-
tee, with additional nominations from
the student body at large. The intro-
duction of the faculty element in no
way takes the matter out of the stu-
dents’ hands, but rather adds the ma-
ture insight of a group whith is re-

moved from the popularity-smoked
reaches of the student body. Too, the

proposal asserts the right of the Stu-
dent Council to select those members
of the faculty who will serve on the
nomination committee.

Tragedy that seems to bear out the
claims of empiricism that experience
is the most valid source of knowledge
points its finger in only one direction
for the prudent. If there is to be no
unnecessary noise and no gambling
in the dorms, it is only necessary that
all firearms be forbidden therein. It
would be much the better thing to
do to gamble for lucre than for lives.

Much thought and effort has gone
into the amendments set forth today.
They are not the bid of the Kuyken-
dall Council for the Woodrow Wilson
Great Achievement Award or for im-

mortality among Davidson College
Councils. A group of representative

students chosen by the students has

produced two new flagstones to be
added to the walkway of progress.

The DAVIDSONIAN commends
the Council for its foresight in the
one case and hindsight in the other,
and urges the Student Body to vote
affirmatively for the Honor Council,
with student-faculty committee nomi-
nations, and for the addition to the
Student Body Regulations, forbidding
possession of firearms in the dormi-
tories.—G.W R.

New Court Makes
A Big Difference

The 1958 version of Homecoming
is now all over but for its inevitable
aftermath, and from many reports it
was one of the most successful dance
weekends in history.

To be sure, in one respect, this
one was unique in that our set-up in
the new fraternity court made a dif-
ference.

Gone are the old days of mass
confusion: the days when an alumnus
was handed a coke and forced to stand
up; the days when an adventurous
“soldier-of-fortune” could not get his
privacy in the confines of the “‘little
hut; the days of packed TV rooms
with floor-sitting a necessity; the days
of comparatively worse boarding
house food.

One could elaborate much more
completely the virtues of our present
layout in contrast to the “old way.”
Surely the. numerous alumni who re-
turned, many for the sole purpose of
eyeing the new Court, were impressed
and regretted that they were born
too soon.

In short, the new Patterson Court
just made for a better overall week-
end for those who chose to spend at
least some time on campus. Our on-
ly complaint is that the parking and
traffic situation around the Court was
bad. Couldn't this problem be worked
out more suitably for Mid-winters?

JEFFERSONIANS

Student Leader Explains New Constitutional Amendment,
Describes Council Sentiment On Honor Court Proposal

By 80B LIVINGSTON.
The proposed Honor Court is

at the same time the most logi-

cal and simple, and also the
most visible and far-reaching
improvement to the structure of
our honor system ever proposed.
It. would endeavor to insure an
even greater student control
and thought. behind honor poli-
cy decisions. And, subsidiary to
this. it would open up a broad
field of operations for the legiti-
mate activities of the Student
Council.

What it would do very
simply stated would be to
separate the leyislative and
judicial functions from the
existing Student Council.
For several years, the bur-
den of the combined re-
sponsibility has been’ felt
from within and noticed
from without.

Last year's Student Council
felt this in particular, Matters
that were standard affairs for
student governing bodies else-
where. it could not undertake.

There were two primary rea-
sons given for this, both of
which have been considered and
accepted in the current proposi-
tion. First, the press of other
duties. in some large degree
extra-curricular. This has been
met by the stipulation that the
members of the Honor Court re-

sign from it before running for
any other major campus office.

Second, the lack of experi-
ence was observable. This the
Honor Court proposal would
meet by having its members
serve “for good behavior,” that
is until graduation or conviction
of an offence against the stu-
dént body constitution. which-
ever came first. ©

Half of the Student Council
would say that a semi-restric-
tive method of nomination
would further enhance’ the
amelioration sought here.

No man can serve two
masters, last year’s Student
Councit decided. Therefore,
after preliminary discussion
of the matter, they appoint-
ed a committee which pre-
pared a report on the issue.
This report was accepted by

Student Council as a recom-
mendation to the new by a vote
of 13-0. Over the summer a
preliminary draft. embodying
this report was prepared. The
present Student Council studied
this. the general idea, and ap-
pointed a committee to «do
further work.

The draft of this committec
was accepted 14-0. The valuc
and labor effected on the pro-
position are evident in_ its
wholehearted approval by the
bodies most intimately connect-

° ° « e >

ed with its object.

The only serious division
arose over the method of
nomination. Here the stu-
dent councit was evently
split, 66. The edvocates of
semi-restricted nomination
{the Hamiltonians) offer a
compromise between two
extremes: fully closed nom-
inations and fully open
nomination. The proposal
would have official nomina-
tions of twice the number
of vacancies to be filled
with an additional oppor-
tunity for free nomination
from the floor.

The objects of this are these:
that a closed committee making
the official nomination could
be more objective and less sub-
jective in their choice, that the
better men would be chosen by
this committee more consistent-
ly than the student body has
chosen the better men for the
ordinary Sudent Council. Thus,
they feel that this outweighs
the strict, traditional principles
of the present system.

The opponents of this
(the Jeffersonians) feel that
the seriousness of the of-
fice to the individual stu-
dent asks that this same in-
dividual student be given
free selection of his possi-
ble judges. They further

Student And Squirrel Speak

Tenney Deane

Friends, alumni, and students
of Davidson College were sur-
prised and amused last week-
end when, during the half-time
festivities, a voice broke
through the public address sys-
tem announcing the following:
“|. and now the band will
play our Alma Mater, ‘O Hell,
O Davidson.” Davidson then
went on to win a very import-
ant moral victory.

For the past several weeks,
the lack of grass around the
new fraternity court has caused
some concern to quite a few
fraternities. However, since
Homecoming. our long awaited
grass has finally decided to do
a little growing. As a result of
this, the faculty has organized
another committee to investi-
gate the possibility of the
“spirit” of Homecoming as the
cause.

One of the most elaborate
decorations for last weekend
was evidently overlooked by
the judges on Saturday. The big
“BEAT V.M.1." sign in the front
yard of Martin’s Manor was the
only evidence on Main Street

that anything was happening at:

the college. However, overlook-
ing this fact, the Manor wishes
to announce that it is. holding

second semester rush in the
spring. All interested are asked
to see Ray Spangler for infor-
mation regarding rush parties.

Overheard during the dance
weekend:

When a certain student
and his wife were present-
ed in. the 1.F.C. figure at
the formal dance on Fri-
day night, one very atten-
tive date, noticing the
similiarity of their last
names but missing her title
of matron, remarked to
those standing around her,
“Isn't that tacky, bringing
his sister up here.”

feel that the caliber of the
Student Councils in the
past has been sufficiently
high to justify this.
Another unique feature of the
proposal which might bear some

explication is that the Honor.

Court is to be subsidiary when
in conflict with the Student
Council. The Student Council

will create the policies under
which the Honor Court will sit.
For example, the interpretation
of the drinking rule will rest
with the annually chosen Stu-
dent Council.

The jurisdiction of the Honor
Court will thus rest with the
individual, not making its own
rules of procedure.

Issues Campaign

By TOM KERNAN

~~

a 9
6:

Entering the cafeteria, yesterday, I found my friend,
Godfrey Cringe, enthroned before a piping-hot bowl of
acorn extract (another of Slater's 13-cent bargains). God-
frey was enveléped in a dun-colored overcoat of doubt-
ful origin and a pale blue muffler. Behind his horn-rim-

med glasses, his eyes, on the verge of

a deep scarlet,.

peered moistly at me. “Hab a chair,” he announced

thickly.

“You look a bit under the weather,” I said.
“Cold,” he said, vaguely pointing in the direction of
his nose. “No sleep last weekend—darned cold weather.”

This highly illuminating bit of conversation was inter-
rupted by the arrival of our mutual acquaintance, Bert

Stalwart, Davidson’s most well-rounded student.

“Good afternoon,” he said, “thought I'd have a chat
with you fellows. Have to make it fast, though, got a
meeting in ten minutes. No, ten and three-quarters,” he
said, peering at his own watch. “That clock on the wall
is fast. See!” He shoved his wrist to within an inch of my

face and added

proudly, “Naval Observatory time.”

“FROWWW?’—a violent sneeze from Godfrey punc-
tured Bert’s paean to his watch.
“Oh,” said Bert, “you have a cold, don’t you? You

know, Godfrey, if you took

a little more care of your

body, you wouldn’t have trouble like that. Get out in the
air, man, get out in life. What most people around here
need is a more vigorous approach to life. I hope you
fellows have been going to hear the Big Issues talks. Con-
gressman Trump spoke last night on the evils of the fig-
newton tariff and showed how it was all a ‘Commie’ plot.
Barton Bloat, retired inspector of coal mines for the De-
partment of the Interior, is going to talk tonight—some-
thing about our foreign policy. Have you fellows been
going to hear the Big Issues?”

“Pye had a cold,” said Godfrey, apologetically.

“What!” said Bert, turning red in the face, ‘why [
know what you are, Godfrey Cringe, you’re apathetic!”

“ft am not,” said Godfrey, blushing furiously, “you
take that back. P’ve been sick. You just wait till I get my
health back and you'll see—”

Bert had already gone;

THE PHILOSOPHES

Council To Assume

Role Of Observer ?

By DABNEY STUART

The current problem with
which the Student Council is
faced points to a basic dichoto-
my between approaches to a
philosophy of student govern-
ment. On the one hand there
is the representative theory, on
the other that of leadership.
The alternative methods of
nominating members of the pro-
posed Honor Council. give il-
lustration of each of these ave-
nues of approach to action.

NOMINATION SYSTEM
The point at issue is the ques-
tion of whether or not the mem-
bers will be nominated popu-
larly or whether this popular
nomination will be preceded by
a committee nominative pro-
cess. The latter alternative is
actually a compromise position
between the extremes of total
popular nomination and total
committee nomination. Total
committee nomination, the ap-
proach favored by the majority
of last year’s Student Council,
has been scrapped, which offers
an even more graphic insight

into the principle involved.

Said principle involved, as
manifested by the discussion
that has surrounded this parti-
cular problem, is that of the
conception of both the function
of this body and the best exec-
ution of this function. Should
the Student Council act as mere-
ly a mirror of student. opinion.

it clamp the bit between its

it was time for his meet-

teeth and act in possible con-
tradiction to the general feel-
ing of the student body? Is it,
as a representative instrument,
to wield or be wielded? Should
it lead or represent?

Barry Golden, In the May-
June (1959) issue of the ‘‘Caro-
lina Israelite,” speaks of the
same problem, deploring the
lack of leadership in crucial
areas of our political culture.
Instead of offering leadership.
Mr. Golden maintains, the
elected officials “wait to see
what the Gallup Poll says, and
the diplomat takes a taxi ride
to find out what the people are
saying.”

While the analogy may be a
little strong for the particular
problem expressed in this ar-
ticle, Mr. Golden's pointing to
St. Paul as leader par excel-
lence is vivid. “If St. Paul had
been a ‘sampling man’ instead
of a leader, he would have
packed up and gone back to
Palestine.”

At the outset of the develop-
ment of the proposed Honor
Council there were two basic
reasons for its support. One
was the obvious separation of
legislative and judicial func-
tions of the present Student
Council.

MATURE PROCEDURE

The other, and more funda-
mental, objective was to elimi-
nate in some way the aspect
of popularity from the nomina-
tional procedure. It seems that
the latter reason, originally en-
twined with the coneept of
Honor Council, has itself been
discarded, because such disrup-
tion of the democratic right of
the student body would not be
met sympathotieally by the stu-
dents.

The question at hand indeed
begs itself, and, at least by the
actions of the present Student
Council, has been temporarily
answered. We have gone to the
taxi stand.
