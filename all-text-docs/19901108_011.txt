Kuzmo Knows Film

Impossibly miniaturized by

soccer trophies, Zoran Kuzma-

smiled:

student Speaks Of Study
Abroad Experience In Mexico

By CURT BICKERS

Hilary Coman is an example of
a multi-faceted Davidson student.
A history major with an emphasis
on international studies, Hilary isa
hall counselor, a member of the
international committee, a mem-
ber of the newspaper staff, a Span-
ish AT, and acommunity Big Sis-
ter.

Where in the world, then, did
this very involved person find the
time to study abroad last semester?

“I think studying abroad is
one of the best experiences I’ve
had at Davidson,” Coman said.

Coman went to Guadalajara,
Mexico, on the Davidson-in-Mex-
ico program led by Dr. Hernandez
and Dr. Pena. “Actually, it was not
just Guadalajara. We did a lot of
travelling around in our studies.”

’ Coman revealed that some of
her bestmemories came from trav-
elling to places like Melakue, an
undeveloped coastal area where
the group went for a retreat.

The group also travelled to
Mexico City, the Yucatan Penin-
sula, and Guanajuato, to name a
few.

“Travelling was some of the
best times. You were learning new
things and learning about the other

people in the group as well. It was
a very informal atmosphere. I got
to know the professors ten times
better than if Thad just had classes
with them at Davidson.”

The students paired up and
lived with families. “The interac-
tions I had with my host family and
other Mexicans not only helped
my Spanish, but also gave me a
better perspective for Mexico,”
noted Coman. ;

One of the most striking as-
pects of the Mexican culture, ac-
cording to Coman, is the extent to
which the United States has influ-
enced Mexico.

This observation prompted Co-
man to incorporate international
studies into her major.

Coman also cherished experi-
encing first-hand a culture she had
studied.

When asked why other people
should go abroad, and specifically
to Mexico, Coman said: “People
should go abroad to have some-
thing to compare our culture to,
and to add a unique dimension to
their Davidson experience. Mex-
ico adds a third-world. country
contrast to America’s wealthy
society. The benefits (of going
abroad) far outweigh any difficul-
ties with the language:

Coman definitely thought in-
teractions with the people were
key to the abroad experience: “In
every city we went to, a bunch of
us would hitevery market and bar-
gain with the people. We would
get back to the bus and compare
who got the best bargains. I loved
that.”

A few suggestions Coman had
for the program were that more
girls should participate in the fu-
ture. “There were only two girls
on the trip.”

Also, Coman thought that more
direct interaction could be helpful.
“Our classes were separated from
the Mexican school system. We
kind of stuck together in a group
too, and that is not the best way to
become absorbed into a foreign
country.”

Overall, though, Coman
thought the family she stayed with,
the courses she took, the other
Davidson students on the program
and the professors all combined to
make the program a success.

“T sincerely recommend the
Davidson-in-Mexico program to
anyone with an interest in Spanish
or Latin America," said Coman.
"My semester abroad has definitcly
