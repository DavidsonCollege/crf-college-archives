HERE’S A TRIUMPH
FOR PROHIBITION

How It Has Furnished the World With a
Valuabie Beverage.

While the forces of prohibition were
working to the end that alcohol should
be banished from the U. 8., there was
one man who was working along @
different line from either side In the
question. For seven years this man
labored tn Chicago, to the perfection
of an idea he had conceived, that
lager beer had never in the past been
properly made.

When war time prohibition became
a fact, this man wae not yet ready
with the perfection of his ‘dez, hence

Thies new product, known as MIN-
NBHAHA, pale and special (light and
dark), goes back fifty years in brew-
ing to the good old rich brew of the
old country. Modern beer contained
but Httle barley, being made mostly
of corn, rice, grains, meals, etc. The
new patent brew fs made of only bar
ley and hops; {t le thoroly fermented
and aged for four months. It is thus
rich in digestive properties and high
flavor.

Just before filtering and pasteuriza-

be taken conve- brewers began the making of a new | tion, the patent process is introduced,

On July 19, of this year, the U. 8.
government issued letters patent to
this man, for a new plan of brewing
and finishing beer, which he claims
should have been in use years ago to
make beer a perfectly ideal beverage
for -verybody, and in fact superior to
any known drink for all the famity.

A crude experimental plant was first
ere-ted in Chicago, which proved per

not and could not detect that the
alcohol was absent. It proved ‘o be
exhilarating, however, because of the
hops and carbonic gas.

The Chicago scientist has proved
that alcohol was not necessary in
beer, that in fact it was s detriment,
and so prohibition bad a use it was
never designed to, for it perfected
brewing to a point never dreamed of
