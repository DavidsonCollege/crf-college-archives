Twelve Fantasy Pieces after the

Chopin’s preludes are very

intimate musical pieces. ‘“They

are meant to be played for small
audiences,”’ said Swisher, “‘be-

mances. He was best communi-

“The atmosphere of the old

emotions, the preludes are

outburst of grief and despair.”

The preludes are very
pieces offering only ‘‘brief
glimpses of his inner state of
mind.”

Contrasting to the Romantic
Chopin is the American con-
temporary composer, George
Crumb. Born in 1929, he is ‘still
living and is one of today’s most
important composers.

Crumb’s, Makrokosmos,  Vol-
ume II is very new music since
it was completed in 1973. Each
of the twelve pieces is based on
a different zodiac sign. Crumb
has written three volumes of
Makrokosmos, each based on
the twelve zodiac signs and yet
each very different.

Students enjoy crackerjacks and rhino

On what occasion would cra-
cker jacks be served for re-
freshments? Davidson lovers of

“tradition have continued this

idea, for each year at David-
son’s annual student art. open-
ing, the art enthusiast has the
opportunity to munch on
crackerjacks while viewing a
variety of student art pieces.
This year’s art. opening was the
afternoon of May 2 in Chambers
Gallery and the exhibit con-
tinues until the end of the
school year.

A variety of paintings,
prints, drawings and sculpture
selected from 1978-79 art clas-

plexing compositions. Three a-
wards were presented and cho-
sen by Charlotte artist Kitty
Couch. Couch, a member of
the Charlotte Council on Arts
and Sciences, is a former pro-
fessor at UNCC. She now
works independently and is
recognized as a great promoter
of the arts in the Charlotte area.
These well-chosen pieces are
only three among many ta-
lented works of student art in
the exhibit.

When entering, the visitor,
upon glancing at: the first
painting on the left, is forced to
hasten his step and to take the
full course around the room,
back to the starting point. This
painting by Dan Wilkinson, of a
gray running track streaked in
liries of red and white, suggests
the swiftness and smoothness of
a runner. The clear and distinct
running lanes extend diagonally
across the canvas, contrasting
with an old, paint-chipped sta-
dium in the background.

A painting by Gary Hazlett,
awarded second prize, awakens
one’s imagination with the im-

ages and colors. It stands out
ae its bright oranges, tur-
quoises, and reds, browns, and
blacks. But at a closer look, the

many details can be better

horned animal sits at a table

“distance men break-through

doors and cabinets. The bizarre
action throughout the painting
builds one’s curiousity and
leaves one quite perplexed.
On the back wall, amidst
obscure and earth-toned pain-
tings, there is an appealing,

gradually darken as they move

from the bottom of the pain-

ting upward. A deep gray meets
the darkest blue and the shades
of gray become lighter as they

reach the top of the painting. A .

floats among the striped shades
of blues and grays.

Surrounded by other ab-
stract, multi-colored paintings,
a headless, pink and green
fingered figure plays a stringed
instrument. Remnants of oddly
shaped, and multi-colored in-
struments weave themselves
about the painting. The rusts,
greens, browns, and golds give
the painting a soft quality and
the sharp and abrupt angles
suggest characteristics of Pi-
casso.

Smaller watercolors and
prints line the right wall. In the
center, facing the balcony, nu-
merous earth-toned and land-
scape paintings greet one’s
eyes.

The third award, given ‘to
Paul Schulz, projects a variety
of feelings. The distorted ben-
ding and curling leaves suggest
movement in the air. Their rich
autumn colors of yellow, o-
range, mauve, rust and brown
fill the painting with the mem-
ories of late autumn days.

On the balcony, between

vicious eyes of a jungle cat and

sad, circus clown eyes, stands
one of the most unique items in
the art show. It is ‘‘the rhino,”
as it’ has come to be known

around campus. Its wagging

‘humorous, inventive, and en-
joyable 7-foot piece of sculpture
‘can be accounted to the crea-
tivity and skills of Davidson
senior art major, John Evans.
“The rhino’’ has been around
Davidson for more than two
years. John began it his junior
year. After buying one hundred
pounds of steel, he began the
head which he said was the
most difficult part. He set up
his equipment two miles off
campus. The only guidelines he
used were a xeroxed copy of a
rhinocerous from a book.

John found two barrels be-
hind the maintenance building
at Davidson which he used for
the torso. He cut open one of

‘the barrels and welded pieces of

the other black one to obtain the
designated size. It took a month
to complete the torso and after
finishing the legs, he welded
them to the body, closed up the
behind, and, at the end, welded
on the head. He finished the
rhino behind Julia Johnson
House this year.

In the welding process it is
necessary to have welding rods,
which are melted down, to
connect the pieces of steel. John
used coat hangers and his rhino
consists of 125 of them! The
smooth texture and silver color-
ing adds to the aesthetic appeal
of the rhino by making an
attractive contrast with the
rough and rustic surface of the
rhino’s body.

John experimented with the -

welding technique in high
school and took evening courses
two years ago at CPCC. The
rhino is his first welding pro-
ject. The idea of creating a
rhinoceros occurred to John
because he had left an unfin-
ished marble sculptured rhino-
cerous in high school. He felt
the need to finish it. The
finished rhino has been a superb
crowd pleaser. 4

ancient and new mythology,”
said Swisher. Crumb gives the
distinct sefse of the inner
meanings of the stars and the
connection between man and
the heavens although “man’s
intellects are not controlled by
what is above.”

“Musically speaking, Crumb
has synthesized many of the
main currents of the 20th
century music such as new
harmonies, new instruments,
new uses for old instruments,
new forms or total denial of
form, and extraordinary new
sounds, and has developed a
personal style that is very
distinctive,’’ said Swisher.

In performing the twelve
pieces Crumb. often calls on the
pianist to play inside the piano
on the strings by plucking or
muting them. At other times
the pianist will place objects
inside the piano such as paper
to produce ‘‘a very colorful. yet
subtle percussion effect that is
often found in Oriental music.”

d Crumb’s modernity

Bah

Agro

(Phil Howerton)

Other strange effects involve
the pianist singing, whispering,
shouting or whistling into the
piano. The strings pick up the
overtones of the sound and’
begin to vibrate.

‘Amplifying it (the entire
musical work) adds to the
mystical aura of the whole.
piece. There is the sense of the
performer and piano as one,”
feels Swisher.

Whereas Chopin has such
personal music, Crumb wants
an extension of the performer
to give the music a large scale
focus, a larger than life quality
so that “it (the music) perme-
ates the universe.”

Another contrast between the
two composers is that Crumb’s
music sounds very optimistic
while Chopin’s is more pessi-
mistic and disillusioned.

Mr. Swisher’s . performance
will be held in Hodson Hall of
the Cunningham Fine Arts
Center.
