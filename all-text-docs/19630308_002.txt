The Rule Awakens

Quite a bit of misunderstanding
has been generated between the ad-
ministration and Patterson Court dur-
ing the past few weeks. It seems
there’s this rule about drinking . . .
But let’s go back a little.

For the last two years student coun-
cils have attempted to liquidate the
sometimes slumbering, sometimes
waking off-campus drinking rule.
Danny Carrell has pronounced the
epitaph of efforts by this year’s coun-
cil to change it.

There were some results—stud-
ent representation on the committee
and a trifling change in the drinking
rule’s cousin, the fraternity function
rule (You can now have as many chap-
aroned alcohol-free parties as you
want.). The biggest results were prob-
ably incidental lessons in practical
politics. An “A” for effort. ;

The recent misunderstanding be-
gan when five fraternities found out
the hard way that the curfew rule was
to be enforced from now on. The spirit
of the drinking rule awoke at all the
ruckus and “suggested” to two fra-
ternities that they had better not hold

Artist Series Answer

The Judith Anderson presenta-
tion last week represented a milestone
in Davidson’s Artist Series. The Artist
Series Committee ran the program as
an extra, and was thus able to sell
tickets to outsiders. Twenty-four hours
prior to the performance over 750
seats were sold and by showtime the
gate had risen to 800. This was the
largest sale ever to be made in the
history of the series, and could pro-
vide the key to enlivening a program
which has sometimes seemed down-
right unattractive to the student body
the last few years.

Admittedly the Series Committee
has had problems in attracting big—
and at times even medium—names for
its programs with only the money al-
lotted to the series from the student
activities fund. The big names are
pulling anywhere from five thousand

An Active Election

About this time every year
seniors start basking in their senility
and there is a natural tendency to
reminisce on those frosted days of
yore. We indulged in this pasttime this
week and tried to recall past student
body pres. elections. It wasn’t easy
making out the details. But one thing
was clear—the candidates and the is-
sues left pretty much the same impres-
sion.

You know one of them in a super-
ficial way. He looks sharp in Ist period
History. Or he belongs to an all-right
fraternity. ‘

But you still aren’t convinced he’s
the right leader, so you go to assembly
to make up your mind. It makes little
difference though because unless your
candidate gets foot-in-mouth disease
or something, you find he endorses
about the same things as the others.
So you vote for him.

The point is you didn’t hear much

Noted In Passing.

© Gov. Ross Barnett has been urging
college graduates to stay in Mississippi
because “you have more opportuni-
ties here than anywhere else in the
world.”

They ought to have more oppor-
tunities. They’ve gotten more federal
aid than anywhere else.

® Because we like to live, we were
interested to see a study on the rela-
tionship of smoking to the life span
recently published.

Apparently statistics show that
23% of all nonsmoking 21-year-old
males in the U.S. will not make it to
age 65. The death rate rises for smok-
ers. Of those who smoke ten and fewer
cigarettes a day, 27% won't see 65; of
those who smoke one to two packs a
day, the mortality is 38%; and of

a couple of parties they had planned.
Needless to say the muscle behind the
suggestion was not lost on those who
knew the advice was coming from the
enforcer-interpreters.

The protests from the court were
a natural enough reaction. What was
potentially dangerous was the “Hell
with them!” attitude that was being
expressed by many in private. This
stemmed from the view that they
were being dealt with as the parent
would deal with the rebellious child.
And it did appear for a time that co-
operation and consideration of both
sides of the question had been sacri-
ficed to a strict laying down of the law.

We are glad to see that the Com-
mittee on Fraternities, Clubs, and So-
cial Life is sending its members _ to
fully explain the rule to the Court. We
hope there will be some serious listen-
ing on both sides. Because the minute
any group of students feels it has lost
its middle ground or voice in its own
affairs, pressure will build for the
dialogue to stop.

Then the real children will take
over.

up for one night stands these days.
Davidson can only afford to spend
that kind of. money on IBM machines.

But with the Judith Anderson
program the Artist Series Committee
waded into the field of promotion. It
obtained a star, advertised the per-
formance, and sold tickets to help pay
for the program. People frem Char-
lotte came out, seventy of them paying
as much as five dollars a seat for the
privilege of hearing a performer in
whom they were really interested.

The day has come when top flight
artists command more than we alone
can afford to pay. The problem is as
simple as that. The answer came to us
last week. In order to provide a high
quality Artist Series. Davidson must
turn more and more to promotion and
outside support.

difference in the speeches and when
you vote you've forgotten all of the
qualifications you didn’t have time to
read about in the newpaper. You just
choose the good guy image.

The speeches could have made-a
difference though. You wish you had
heard one word of the candidates’
qualifications.

You miss the frank assertion
of self that can only be echoed in a
campaign manager's speech. Only can
another person give the candidate’s
self-effacing promises some human
basis by personal testimony.

The supporting superlatives may
be somewhat distorted but they do add
Spirit to the thing. We would. like to
see some real campaign speeches
made by real campaign managers.
Qualifications deserve at least as much
emphasis as anonymous promises.

Who knows? Qualifications might
decide the outcome.

cigarettes a day, 41% will not make it

As one national magazine has put
it, it wasn't so long ago that a whole
cranberry crop was condemned with
less conclusive evidence.

® We understand that perhaps a ma-
jority of students do vote in elections.
Of course it depends which election
you are looking at (consider Wednes-
day’s turnout of 419 for instance). If
we have offended any non-voters on
campus though, we apologize. Wa
certainly didn’t intend to persecute a
minority group.

If we thought that it would en-
sure domestic tranquility, we would
be the first to defend the dynamic
status quo.

MacDonald Suggests Changes In Library

BY WALTER MACDONALD

In higher education the li-
brary has replaced the single
volume as the student’s text-
book. Thus, the goal of a col-
lege library should. be to pro-
vide the intellectual resources
of books, periodicals, and
pamphlets needed to sustain
the work of the academic cur-
Ticulum.

At present, the Grey Memorial
Library contains 96,000 plus
volumes and over 500 periodi-
cals. Approximately 6,000 vol-
umes are added to the library
each year. Between July, 1961
and July, 1962, Davidson's total
library expenditures, excluding
costs of the capital plant, utili-
ties, janitorial service, etc., was
4.75 per cent of the total insti-

The

tutional expenditures for edu-
cational and general purposes.
This is 0.25 per cent lower than
the minimum recommended by
the American Library Associa-
tion.

in a recent comperison with

12 ranking liberal erts col-

leges with goals similer to

Davidson's the college library

stood poorly in dollers spent

per student per year. The 12

averaged 95 dollers per stud-

ent per year; Davidson averag-
ed 65 dollars.

The library is presently faced
with three main problems: the
lack of enough books for re-
search in depth; an undersized
periodical library; and an under-
staffed and overworked library
staff. These problems must be

solved if the library is to ac-
complish its goals in the immed-
iate future.

The number of bound volumes
should be greatly increased. No
limit should be made on the
number of volumes needed for
a college library of our type be-
cause no library is ever ade-
quate. There are a number of
ways in which the book stock
can be increased. The faculty
should spend alt the book money
allotted it. This has not always
been done in the past and both
the quality and quantity of the
library has suffered because of
it.

Individual professors should
be responsible for books dealing
with their specialty, and the
departments as a whole should

Vast Wasteland

Bernard: ‘Davidson Is
Pretty Gocd After All’

Bernard

Dear Editor:

Through some quirk of the
US. mails the February 15 and
February 22 issues of THE
DAVIDSONIAN both reashed
me yesterday. The number ef
articles and editorials that were
either directly or indirec‘ly
critical of Davidson appalled
me. To list a number of them:
Goodykoontz Goodbve- Caustic
Carrell Censures Faculty; Mill-
er Plans Departure: Tho Oath
In Committee; Hindu Talks
Christianity; Revelation: Re
vealing Reviews.

This letter is not written in
criticism of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN or any of the above articles,
though I would certainly take
issue with some of them. But
rather, in contrast, this letter is
written to say something pleas-
ant.

I like Davidson. It has a good
student body, a good faculty, a
good administration, and a good
staff. It has had a noble history,
is having a noteworthy present
eminently comparable to the
best colleges in the country, and
will, I believe, have an even
better future.

While I am sure there are
those at Davidson with a wider
basis for judgment, my own ex-
perience is at least sufficient to
give credence to the above
statement—nine years at the
University of Virginia, six years
at Yale University, seven years
at Davidson, and currently a
year at Dartmouth College while
on leave from Davidson.

Dear Editor:

With the second resignation
of Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz (and
this one appears to be for good),
I feel that we, as students,
should examine our part in the
Vagabonds. Before I go any
further, I should like to point
out that this is not an attempt
to rationalize anybody's actions
or to condemn anyone's lack of
participation in the program.

Dr. Goodykoontz stated that
one of the major problems is
that drama is fourth or fifth in
the list of extracurricular activi-
ties. Sadly, this is true, but
such should not be the case. As
students we come to college, or
Should, in order to have our
minds and beliefs challenged,

hopefully with the result that
they are made stronger or are
discarded.

I know of nowhere a person is
made to really think more than
at a modern play. I think that
the entire probiem lies in the
fact that most students are
tither too lazy or too seared to
want to think and so they stay
away from drama.

The problems that face the
Vagabonds from the Administra-
tion would, it seems to me, be
much easier overcome if the
Vagabonds had a large student
group supporting them. It
would be much easier to ask for
a pick-up truck if the Adminis.
tration knew that a hundred
students would benefit from it.
As it is, the good done goes to
such a few people that it does
not ‘justify the cost of sponsor-
ing the Vagabonds program.

Work in the Vagabonds does
not require that one live in the
Fine Arts Building. It may
mean this for a week during
production of your play, but the
rewards are worth it. You don't
have to be in every play. It
would be wonderful if you
would do one and then bring
someone to take your part for
the next play.

Also, support includes going
to the plays. The Vagabonds get
discouraged when they play to
empty houses. It does not re-
quire more time to sit through
a play than most students waste
every day. If you are one of the
“studiers", you are organized
enough so that you can free
from your schedule three hours
one night, about once a month,
to see your classmates and
friends.

T am voting to keep the Vaga-
bonds and to support them. How
do you vote?

Dear Editor:

The recent action taken by
the Trustees on the faculty oath
issue is reminiscent of the an-
cient fable, “The Three Peasants
and the Wolves.” The three
peasants who had been out in
the forest cutting timber were
huddled around their campfire
that night. while the wolves had
assembled and were patrolling
the ring of darkness around the
lighted area.

The peasants, having no weap-
ons but their axes, were quite
understandably getting rather

nervous about the intentions of
the great, shadowy shapes with
the glaring, luminous eyes and.
gleaming fangs that were glid-
ing about in the outer darkness.
Although the wolves refused to
venture into the light, the peas-
ants decided that the situation
was rapidly becoming psycholo-
zically insupportable and took.
counsel upon a possible course -
of action. After long and earnest
debate, a mutually acceptable
decision was reached. They
would extinguish the fire there-
by making the wolf-shapes go
away.

This is essentially the same
action that the Trustees have
taken. Instead of taking a posi-
tive stand on one side or the
other of this inflammatory is-
sue, they have adopted the
classic tactic of quietly shelving
the issue, putting out the fire,
in the- hope that the entire
messy situation will quietly dis-
appear. Behind a screen of plati-
tudes from Trustee Chairman
Richards: “ . . . maintain the
college's Christian witness ...,
We see no reason for changing
what has worked well through
the years... , But we will cer-
tainly carefully consider the is-
sue—it won't be closed in ad-
vance.”, the oath issue has been
‘railroaded into committee “for
further study,”

It has been pointed out that
committees often get things
done. I submit that the commit-
tee is also an excellent place for
disposing of the unwanted cats
of legislation and policy that re-
fuse to die quickly, decently,
and with a minimum of vulgar
theatricalities. If the reader de-
sires corroborative evidence for
the above statement, I refer him
to the Congressional Record.

But taken in a broader sense,
the oath itself is an attempt to
extinguish, or at least hide, the
fire. The wolves of atheism,
agnosticism, and non-Presbyter-
ian Christianity are gathering on
the rim of the light. Jesus said,
“Let your light so shine before
men..." The oath is trying
to build a bushel around that
light.

If the Christian atmosphere of
Davidson, which the Trustees
claim they are trying to pre-
serve, cannot survive without
Medieval laws and coercion,
then we have already gone to
the wolves and just don’t know
it yet. Perhaps this is for the
best.

work together with the library
staff in filling areas not under
the responsibility of the individ-
ual professors. The cooperation
between library administration
and faculty would call for a
systemized program of advice
and purchasing. A survey of the
present major fields and their
subdivisions wodld point out the
gaps that need to be filled.

Students should make use
of the suggestion box in the
right foyer on the mein floor
of the library. At present,
student requests average be-
tween six and ten per month.
If the student needs books
that ere not available tn the
Davidson Library, he can use
the interlibrary loan to get
books from the most ade-
quate libraries in the nation.

The system of handling
periodicals needs to be revised.
There are many fields which
need to be covered more ade-
quately. Back issues of learned
journals should be purchased.
The present system of checking
out periodicals should be re-
versed so that bound periodicals
could be checked out of the li-
brary. The student would then
be required. to pay for any vol-
umes he lost.

The library needs at least two
more qualified assistants to
work on the staff. An assistant
cataloguer is needed to aid in
the ‘cataloguing of the ever in-
creasing number of books pur-

chased by the library. A full-
time reference librarian is need-
ed to aid both faculty and stud-
ents in their research. These two
librarians could take the load
off the present staff and thus
allow them to do their own work
more efficiently.

By the early 1970's the library
will have 150,000 volumes and
there will be no more room to
expand. This means that a new
wing will have to be added.
When this does happen there
are three things that should be
built into the new wing. A new
reserve reading room is needed.
The present reserve room is too
small, too noisy, and poorly
lighted. Some improvements can
be made now. New lights should
be installed in the present read-
ing room. If this is not possible,
the 60 watt bulbs should at least
be replaced by 100 watt bulbs.
The two-hour limit on reserve
books should be extended to
three hours. Fines should not
exceed the value of the books.

A rare. book room should also
have a place in the new wing so
that| Davidson's collection of
rare books can be better dis-
played. <A drama and poetry
room is also needed in which the
student can listen to readings of
drama and poetry on records or
tape recordings. Until this room
is built. the Fine Arts Building
could be used. In the meantime,
tapes and records should be pur-
chased with the idea of a separ-
ate room in the future.

Relate Ole Miss Incidents

BY BOBBY AUMAN

At my home on a Sunday dur-
ing a recent vacation were two
officers from Fort Bragg who
had been sent to Oxford, Miss-
issippi during the University
crisis. 1/Lt. Daniel Tuma of
Lincoln, Nebraska and 2/L+t.
Edward Hospodar of Indiana,
Pennsylvania related their ex-
periences to my family and me
that afternoon, and I thought
perhaps these experiences. would
be of interest to Davidson stud-
ents.

Lt. Tuma told how they were
called the K. K. K. by the peo-
ple of Mississippi, the letters
standing for ‘“Kennedy’s Koon
Korps.” He said that his duties
were certainly not pleasant ones,
and that one of his most un-
pleasant assignments was to give
an order that no Negro ser-
geants could occupy command
posts in jeeps.

After the United States had
spent two million dollars to
place Meredith in ‘Ole Miss,
Tuma found it very disconcert-
ing when Meredith complained
about the segregation of the
troops. He thought that Mere-
dith certainly had no right to
express anything but his grati-
tude to the United States Army.

Tuma related several enec-
dotes about his trip te Miss-
lesippi. He said that 97 Army
vehicles passed through At-
lanta around 5:30. in the after:
noon obeying no red lights
and speed limits, He told of
an early morning incident in
Georgie, when e young school
boy asked him what he had in
his Army truck. Dan said
thet it was a cannon. The boy
then asked: “Where are you
going with it? Tuma lied:

“Fort Hood, Texas.” The
young scholar then said: “Why
don’t you pass through Ox-
ford, Mississippi on your way
and shoot the hell out of that
nigger with that cannon?”
He told about being stopped
at a red light in an Alabama
town, and a farmer in a pick-up
pulled up beside of him and
said: “Well, if you live through
Oxford, we'll both be in Tus
caloosa at the beginning of next
semester. Till see you there,

EVEN THE MOST SIMPLE DOG
CAN ‘BE TRAINED TO FETCH
HIS MASTER'S. SLIPPERS !

Lieutenant!" Tuma told about
how really scared he was while
passing through Tupelo, Mississ-
ippi when the hostile townspeo-
ple shouted and booed at the
troops.

At the height of the crisis,
Hospodar was in Jump School
at Fort Benning and therefore
did not travel with his Com-
pany. He flew to Oxford and
was there only a short while,
but said that the time really
seemed much longer. Their diet
of C Rations was a hard one,
but was necessary since Mississ-
ippi merchants would not sell
them anything. Just prior to de-
parture, the soldiers were paid
but were unable to spend their
money when they arrived in
Oxford.

My brother, 2/Lt. Clyde W.
Auman is stationed at Fort
Bragg but was not sent to Miss- .,
issippi. However, most of his
best friends were sent, and he
heard their reactions to Oxford. |
One of his friends there is Lt.
James Livingston, brother of
Bobby Livingston, ‘60. Living-
ston set up a road block near
the graveyard where William
Faulkner is buried, and he visit-
ed Faulkner’s grave.

He asked a farmer if many
people visited that graveyard.
The fermer said, “Well, yes,
especially since Bill Faulkner
was buried. Why, | suppese
four or five hundred people
have been by here since Bill
Faulkner passed away.”

Livingston then asked: ‘This
Bill Faulkner, was he very well
known?” The reply to this was:
“Yes, I suppose so. Seems like
everybody around here knew
Bill Faulkner. 2 reckon every-
body in the county knew who
Bill Faulkner was.”

Tuma and Hospodar stated
that their stay in Mississippi
was not in the least enjoyable,
and that they considered getting
back on North Carolina soil one
of the happiest moments of their
lives,

Reflecting on the crisis and
on the candid reactions of two
who were in the midst. of it, one
finds an old saying appropriate:
“The world is a comedy to those
who think, a tragedy to those
who feel.”

YOURE COMPLETELY USELESS!

T CAN THINK OF NOTHING
MORE UNSANITARY!
