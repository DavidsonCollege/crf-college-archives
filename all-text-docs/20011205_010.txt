had to wrestle first, which isn’t easy in his
situation.”

After four loses, including a forfeit in the
133-pound division and the disqualification
of senior Ryan Owens in the 141-pound divi-
sion, the Wildcats bounced back with a nar-
row victory by sophomore Adam Sperling
(149). Entering into the third period, Sperling
and his opponent Eddie Vasques were tied at
6-6, but, with a ride out, Sperling won 7-6.

In the 157-pound weight class, Bender had
a decisive victory over opponent Josh Merry.
Controlling the entire match, Bender easily
defeated Merry 10-2.

The final Wildcat victory of the afternoon
came in the 184-pound division. Senior Jeff

Libersat dominated his opponent Cliff Poynter
with four takedowns in the opening period.
Libersat won the match in an 8-4 decision.

“Yesterday’s meet showed us that we still
have a lot of things to work 0,” said Storms.
‘**However, our team is in no way afraid of or
unaccustomed to hard work, so I would ex-
pect far brighter performances from us in the
future.”

Sperling agreed, “We’re starting to see
signs of improvement, which is always good
this early in the season, but with this, we’re
also starting to see the areas which need
improvement.”

In his first visit to campus, former WWF
wrestler Rick Flair saw the potential within
the Wildcat squad as well. “This will be a
great program in years to come,” commented
Flair. “[Davidson] has one of the best coaches
in the country, that’s for sure.”
