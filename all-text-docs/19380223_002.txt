Art Exhibit...

We had always been led to believe that
the arts had very little place in the minds
and interests of students at Davidson. In
thal we were quite wrong

The overwhelming attendance at the stu-
dent art exhibit proved that conclusively.
The majority of the students and the facul-
ty, and a iarge number of townspeople
attended, __

Of course, the exhibit was amateurish. It
coald ot be otherwise. i was the first
thing of its kind ever hela at Davidson. Most
of the works exhibited were done hurtiedly
in an attempt to make ihe deadline of the
exhibit. And still it was a suecess.

Many of the pietures displayed were ex
cellent and drew favorable comment. That.
. however, is not important. ‘The importance
lies in.the iaet that itis a beginning. His a
precedent. It is an awakening of interest
among student artists and it is an awaken-
ing of art appreciation in the average stu-
dent who is not himseli artistically inclined.

And the exhibit was certainly in aecord
with the spirit of Davidson College in its en-
couragement of the fine arts.

A Social Center?...

—Last.week.a-raiher unusual but exceltent
idea came to us through a member of the
junior class, Johr. Mawhinney. The recent
announcement that a new library would be
the next addition to the campus prompted
the thougat.

The idea is ahis~ that the old Kbrary,
when vacated. could and should be turned
into a social center, if not permanently, at
least temporarily, ‘since the erection of a

From Our Notebook

A little insight into faculty life came
our way the other day in a note left by
mistake in a returned library book. It
read: “Darling, do you have to read ALL
the time?” and was intended for the keep-
er of the stacks.

Another “stranger thas tiction” case came
to us through bielogy Jab. assistant, Sam
Webb. He swears to its authenticity so
we'll take his word tor it. According to
Webb, one of the mieroseopes ia the biology
lab was so plaeed on the desk, that the sun
shone directly upon the little mirror on the
bottom and the rays reflected up through
the lens of the ‘scope. The beam focused on
the black eloth hood used to protect the
microscope and when last seen the cloth was
a mass of ashes.

Sam Ryburn has an answer for any-
thing, even if it is business psychology.
Said Dr. Hood: “What are some of the
outstanding things you want about a
car?” Replied knowing Ryburn: “A steer-
ing wheel, doctor.” Ryburn explained to‘
us recently the reason for Carolina’s
double jointed frosh wrestler. Said Ry-
burn: “His mother was frightened by a
pretzel.”

peeled an ear. Then he turned on the light
and saw a breadcrumb on the board.
“What did you say little tid-bit?” mur-‘

STUDENTS TRY TO
ESCAPE DAVIDSON ...
Dear Dick:

RORU in the past few weeks has
written to .The Davidsonian some
rather interesting letters, and. in
spite of his fierceness. they did con-
tain some truth. But l wonder if
RORU or other students on the
cainpus have stopped to realize
why existing conditions on the cam-
pus’ in any activity you can name
are such: I admit that this seems
rather sophomorie. but: that is to
be expected.

We are not interested in politics,

“strikes, world conditions, etc. or

doing anything about them, be-
Cause “we werent, brung up right.”
Very few students here at David-
son come from mill homes, so why
ehduld they be interested. or those
of us from Yankee-land are not too
well acquainted with the city slums,
sO again passiveness. War is too
‘distant an affair for many of us to
arouse interest in and not until our
own toes are stepped on will we
squeal. Our focal news-rag. The
Observer, is not very helpipl in. aid-
ing us in discriminating between |
important@and less important things
of life. They use the same size
head whether it’s the war in China
or the Yankees the World
Series,

To attack other fields, let us take
our apparent growing disinterest in
religion. It is not apathy for re-
ligion but dislike of the type found
at Davidson which seems to offer
the student nothing which he needs.
lustitutionalized religion does little
to help us in our daily problems. We
ate not greated as part OF the
church but more - like. week-end
Buests. An album of pictures tak-
en during chapel and _vespers might
prove this point better than my
words,

The growing fad seems to be to
escape Davidson ‘rather than to as-
similate it. This is indicated by the
growing tendeney to leaveson week-
ends. And there is much to escape.
But unfortunately they return to
the campus with even worse pos-
sessions. There has been spreading
an attitude of bad manners that is
a disgrace to anything or anybody
anywhere, that calls itseli gentle-
manly. We are disrespectful to .the

win

President of the college. to our
guests and our fellow — students.-

This attitude, ii inereased. will do
more harm to.the college. than
anything else possibly could. It is

. expressed in two words too fre-

‘|‘how unappealing

quently heard ... “So what.”

The college well expressed itself
ina recent bulletin sent to prospec-
tive students. “Times Change, Dav-
idson Stands.” How true this is and
to high = school
seniors. Untit Davidson dares to
use the word progressive and to},

mote future.

It was suggested that the lower rooms be
used as reading and lounging rooms, with
more comfortable furniture added. A piano
and radio for general use could be kept in
one of these lower rooms.

Upstairs, where the stacks now are, the
concrete floors would provide a fine base for
billiard and ping-pong tables. It was sug-
gested that, if necessary, a partition could
be taken out, allowing more space upstairs.

These upstairs rooms, and perhaps even
the basement rooms, could be used for club
and honorary fraternity meetings. In other

words, although the library is small it wéuld
fulfill most of the needs.

; There would be some incentive toward

staying on the campus, if recreation were
provided thus.
the desire and need of a social center would
be fulfilled much sooner. Of course it is only
a suggestion, but it has possibilities.

And by using the library

Up until very recent years that
class had this privilege, and I feet
sure that if it were given to the
ireshmen again, we would acquire
a greater unity of co-operation in
Student government and. in build-

ADVISOR FAVORS
FRESHMEN VOTING...
Dear Editor:

My acquaintance with the present
treshman class has led me to be-
lieve that: the point about fresh-
mei voting is well taken. In class
affairs the freshmen have shown
a sense of judgment and a capacity
for careful thought that justifies
this change in our student govern-
ment.

—WATSON STREET.

BORU RENEWS
OLD ISSUE...

Quite a large number of the
members of the student body have
tailed entirely to get the point of
these letters, due largely, to the
clumsy style of the writer. Many
think these efforts to be those of
just another habitual critic and
fault-finder, who would have been
very unhappy at” some perfect
school where there Would have been
nothing to “gripe” about. But
those who hold to this opinion have
missed the reason for these efforts,
which are made solely in the inter-
est of “a better Davidson,” The
writer's feelings are best expressed
in these words of the immortal Ho-
tace: “Hominem non odi sed ejus
vitia.”

What ought to be changed this
week? The answer .— not a new

one, but one which has been
harped upon before. GIVE BACK
THE FRESHMAN VOTE! Stu-

ng
dent body sentiment has evidently |" °

changed since the freshman fran-
chise, was last considered by the
students. In The Davidsonian colt-
umn, “The Question of the Week,”
only one man out of five question-
ed, a reasonable cross-section of the
student body, opposed the return
to former conditions. Not only
that but other indications point to
a change of heart on the part of the
student body. Sinee the first Ict-
ter there has been heard essen-
tially no unfavofable comment on
the change, the allies outnumber-
ing the opponents by a majority
even greater than the four-to-one
of the “Question” column. In view
of the obviously ‘indicated student
body support of a constitttional
amendment, enabling freshmen to
vote in the elections at the end of
their freshman. year, the student
council is called upon to give the
student ‘body an Opportunity to ex-
press itseli upon this question. '
Popular misunderstanding of last
week's proposals require a brief ex-
planation of the term, “controlled
politics.” qT
Whatever be its form, a system is
needed which will present to the
student body the qualifications of

the nominees for election before

The Setting... College gym with

‘Clemson game in progress ... The
actors'— certain ill-bred,  addle-
brained scremo-maniacs . . . The

action—a disgusting exhibition of
technique in the vice of booing and
hissing. Res&lt—complete humilia-
tion for every self-respecting Dav-
idson man present. Too many pleas
for good sportsmanship have been
made already, and since that proves
useless, this is not one; for so help
me, at the first occasion, I intend
to take the name of every guy even
puckering his lips to boo and pub-
licly expose him for what he is—
a cheap, annoying, offensive exhi-
bitionist who perpetrates his loud-
ness only in the shelter of a crowd.

The students turned out very well

ON THE CAMPUS — Many boys
visited and enjoyed the student art
exhibit. The paitting ‘Peasant Girl’
was the big thing of the exhibit.
Have you noticed flowers bloom-
ing and the trees budding on the
campus? — Taking a long walk is
suggested as the best way of spend-
ing that long Sunday afternoon.
Apout half the student body was
seen this past Sunday either on the
golf course or the Concord Road,
and what weather !

THUMB NAIL SKETCH—Again
yes it’s happened again. Another
person from East Tennessee has
broken into print. They must have
something over there besides child
marriages that turn out real men,
for this person seems to me to be
pretty well on the way to manhood.
He also indulges in’ his favorite hill-
billy songs when ever the right
chance comes and has even ap-
peared on a chapel program to ren-
der us a song, Incidentally he is re-
puted to be quite some shakes as
a football player and has one more
year to play. In his own words he
tells us ‘his intelligence is only sur-
passed by his good looks.’ A quiet
but friendly person, he is what one
would call a swell fellow. Ask him
what he knows about Raymond.
Will come when called ‘House of
David’~or ‘Bob Johnson's room-:
mate.’ There is a rumor that he is
captain of the football team.
