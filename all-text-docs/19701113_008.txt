Conference Receiving Mark

Threatened By Mikolayunas

By A. W. TURNER |
Asst. Sports Editor

With three games _re-
maining Mike Mikolayunas
is bearing down on the
Southern Conference receiv-
ing record.

Mikolayunas must catch
eight passes to eclipse the
old conference record set by
Mike Kelley. He has hauled

in 62 passes for 797 yards
to lead the nation.
Mikolayunas, a Baltimore
product, had an outstanding
school record. He earned
nine letters in four sports
at Cardinal Gibbons High
School, especially excelling
in basketball and football.
As a. senior, Mikolayunas
was named to several mythi-
cal football squads, “the
most important being
the all4/Maryland Scholastic
Association team. He and
Notre Dame's Tom Gate-
wood were the ends on that
honorary team.
Mikolayunas received of-

not. I hope I can get a
chance to play.

“If I can’t play,’’ Mikola-
yunas continued, ‘‘I’ll proba-
bly go on to _ graduate
school, in education, _physi-
é¢al education, or something
like that. If I don't get to
play I would like to coach."
~ Mikolayunas was optimis-
tic about this year’s Wild-
cat gridders. ‘‘We have good
potential,’’” he commented.
“We just can't get the
breaks to fall our way. But
we aren't down and out yet.
If we can just get it all to-
gether, if we can get the
momentufn going, we can

He decided to accept an

Davidson Hosts Regatta

Davidson__-will host the
South Atlantic Interscholas-
tic Sailing Association final
regatta tomorrow on Lake
‘Norman at 10 a.m.

This regatta will deter-
mine the'final places for the
eleven member teams of the
conference, and also deter-
mine which team will parti-
cipate in-inter-sectional con-
tests next spring.

‘ ‘Bight teams are expected
to attend the regatta, and
little accurate speculation
can be made concerning the
(races, according} to Allen
Lundy, vice-ccommodore of
~ Lundy pointed out the tra-
‘ditional strenghth of the
‘Citadel’ sailors, but said
they were not as strong,

as the team has been in the
past.

‘Lundy and Jim Hunter
both commented on _ the
Strength of the University
of South Carolina team,

-- with their celebrated skipper

Anne Boyd.
“It has appeared that’ the

home team has had a tre-

mendous advantage in all
the regattas so far,’’ Hunt-
er said, ‘‘The home team
has won every race so far,
with the exception of the

College of ‘Charleston, who.
finished a very close se-

cond to Citadel, and, of
course, that was in Citadel
home waters.”’

“We-will-have-a-great- ad:

should be able to win, if
there is not some drastic
upset.’

goal, and scores by Joe “Yo-
chem and Brian Tarr produc-
ed the final 6-2 score.

Tuesday's game against
Emory was played on a
rain soaked field and both
teams suffered because of
the poor footing. Karlsson
again led off ‘the scoring
late in the first quarter with
a head off Tarr’s corner
kick.

Emory tied the game with
a goal in the third quarter,
but ‘Bill Vaughan immedi-
ately gave the Wildcats
what turned out to be the
winning goal, when he scor-
ed on a shot that caromed

‘off the right goal post, into

the net.

As a sophomore, Mikola-
yunas played slotback. Last
season he was-~ ‘Cats’ full-
back, a position he played
early this year until David-
son junked its wishbone -of-
fense and shifted him to
flanker. %

Evidently the move was a

nationak, receiving leader-
ship over his old neighbor
Gatewood.

Mikolayunas expressed no
preference between his last
year’s fullback position and
his new flanker spot.

“1 like the challenge of
running pass patterns, hav-
ing to be very precise about
it. But | also like to run. |
like to be able to do some-
thing with ‘the ball after 1

A psychology major, he is

unsure of his future. “I
would like to play some
more,’ he said, ‘‘Althletics -

ber of pro scouts have talk-
