Red and Black Machine Breaks Even
On North Carolina Baseball Journey

Coach Hengeveld’s Poison Nine Takes Wake Forest in Tow for the
Second Time of the Season, Wins From Elon, But Drops Two in
a Row to Carolina and State.

On their first road trip of the 1922 season, the Wildcat nine broke even, los-
_ing the first two games and winning the second two: Carolina won a closely |
“contested pitchers’ duel by the score of 2 to 0. State defeated the Red and

Black team to the tune of 5 to 3, although Davidson outhit them. The home team
scored a come-back in the next two games, defeating Wake Forest 14 to 13 in a
slugging contest, and downing Elon 9 to 8.

Carolina Game.

# The masterly hurling of Lewellym back
ed by errorless support enabled Carolina
to deféat Davidson Tuesday in the first
game of the Wildcat’s trip by the margin
of 2 to o. The Chapel Hill pitcher held the
Presbyterians to two safeties, a single by
Erwin, M., and a triple by McLeod, those
being the only two Wildcats to get on
the cushions.

Boushee, who was in the firing pit for
Davidson, was in great form and should
“have held the University team scoreless.
Three bad breaks coming in a row in the
eighth lap shoved two counters across
for Carolina after the team should have
been retired. The first two men up got
on safely and were sacrificed along by
Shirley. With the squeeze play on, Lefty
Wilson missed the ball and the runner
was caught flat-footed between third
and home. McMillan, however, dropped
the ball and he returned to third safely.
Wilson then proceeded to strike out but
McMillan bobbed the third strike, lost
the ball under his feet, and Lefty reach-
ed first, clogging the hassocks. To cap
the climax, Casey Morris bounced one to
Luke Erwin that looked like a sure
double killing. But the agate took a
bad hop over his head and continued to
left field, McLean and F, Morris scoring.
Old Man Hard Luck turned over in his
grave three times when he heard of the
game.

Captain Freeman had a big day inthe
field for Davidson. He rolled around his
post at the hot corner like a well-oiled
lawn mower, cutting off several drives
that looked like sure base hits. Eight
chances came his way and he handled
them all faultlessly.

Dr. Taliaferro Thompson
Speaksat Vesper Service

Prominent Union Seminary Man |
Makes Forceful Speech on
Sins of Omission.

Basing his talk on the text: “To he
that knoweth good and doeth it not, to
him it is sin,” Dr. Taliaferro Thompson
brought home to his audience the great-
ness of the sins of omission at the “Y”
service last Sunday night.

In a vigorous and forceful manner he
showed that while many think they have
lived the right life when they have mere-
lv avoided positive sin, they make a
great mistake. He showed this by
numerous illustrations and parables. He
cited an example of this kind in the
parable of the talents in which the man
who had been meticulously careful to
preserve his one talent was cast out
because he had not used it in a positive
manner to the advantage of our Lord.
Again he showed that the fig’ tree which
Christ cursed, withered because it did”
not bring forth fruit. “By their fruits
shall ye know them.”

Drawing his illustration next from
daily life, he said that there were many
ways in which we ‘could live positively
for Christ, telling of the case of a boy
who roomed next door to. him during
Kis college course and whom he could
have ‘helped in many ways but didn’t,
showing the sin of such negative living.«

Finally he told of the need for men
who would devote their talents, perhaps
one, perhaps more, to God. Dealing with
this he pointed out a boy who was elect-
ed the most inflfential man in his class,
despite the fact that his talents were
few, because he had completely conse-
crated them to his Maker.

Track Team Has Difficult
Schedule for Next Week

Sprunt Field Will be the Scene of
Lively Tilt With University of
South Carolina.

The. Wildcat track team will have one
of the hardest battles of the season next
Saturday. South Carolina, fresh from
their wonderful showing in the meet
with North Carolina and Georgia, will
be the invaders. Every man on the Da-
vidson squad is looking for a big scrap,
and preparations are under way for the
event. -

The South Carolinians are said to
have a great outfit, and the results of
the triangular meet seem to bear out
the reports. Holding the lead until the
mile relay, their team showed up espe-
cially well in the weight events, and
there is where the hardest part of the
Davidson meet will come, for the big
Wildcats know their business. Waite,
who holds the S. I. A. A. record for the
javelin with a throw of 178 feet plus,
seems to be THE weight man. He puts
the shot 42 feet 3 inches, and his discus

Vachel Lindsay, Noted Poet.

Davidson to Be Honored
by Visit of Famous Poet

Vachel Lindsay Will be at Davidson |

Next Week in Public Entertain-
ment.

Vachel Lindsay, one of the foremost
poets of America, will visit Davidson on
April 26, If he cannot be called the one
leading poet, he is certainly among the
first four, and his visit to Davidson will
linger long in the memories of those
who hear him,

Not only is he one of the chief con-
temporary poets of America, but he is
also a distinguished lecturer and pos-
sesses many of the qualities of an ora-
tor. Mr. Lindsay regards poetry as
something to be spoken, not merely to
be read, The possession of all of these
excellent qualities, together with the
fact that the poetry which he will read
on the stage in Shearer Hall, at 8:00
p.m. on April 26, is of his own produc-
tion, will make his performance not only
thoughtful and interpretative, but highly
interesting. .

This is his second: trans-continental
tour, and he has made such a hit with
the public, and is so much in demand,
that arrangements are being made for a
third tour as soon as this one is complet-
ec. The following quotation from Tem-
ple Scott in a recent issue of his “Book
Guide” will give some idea of what the’
leading literary men think of him: “His
voice is to me, the one voice in this land
of ours which is singing the high music
of the soul.”

He has a melodious voice of wide
range, is master of the elocutionist’s art,
and can rise, ds the occasion requires,
to any demand of tragedy or comedy.
His whole manner and personality are
delightfully original. It is safe to say that
no one just like Vachel Lindsay has ever
been heard by a Davidson College au-
dience.

From university professor to national
president is a popular sport these days
since our ex-President set the example.
Of the three republics now occupying the
territory of the former Austro-Hungar-

W. A. Gamble Selected as
PeaceOratoryContestant

Will Represent Davidson at State
Contest in Burlington on
April 21st.

In the local preliminaries of the Peace
Oratorical contest, W. A. Gamble was
selected as the Davidson representative,
with D. H. Ogden as alternate. The
finals of this contest will be held in Bur-
lington on April 21,

The local contest, held in Shearer Hall
on Monday, April 17, was one full of in-
terest from beginning to end. Gamble,
the last speaker, in an easy, flowing and
cloquent manner pointed out the only
“path of peace.” Gripping his auditors
from the start he showed that the best
and only way to true world peace was to
be found in the great League of Na-
tions, conceived by the brain of Wood-
row ‘Wilson. This league, based upon
the principles laid down by the Christ of
Calvary, is the one route to permanent
and lasting peace.

New“Y” CabinetSelected
by Pres.-Elect Crawford

New Men Are Named to Run Affairs
of the Student Y. M. C. A.
Next Year.

The Y. M. C. A. has shown a larger |

development this year than any previous
year. It has grown to be a real.factor
on the campus, and mainly because of
the earnest co-operation of the students

with the cabinet and officers.. It has,
undertaken work this year that has}
never been taken up before. The cabi-

net has worked faithfully under the
leadership of Dwight Chalmers and
Julian Price.

Next year the “Y” is planning to carry
on this work and with the co-operation
of every man on the Hill it will continue
to be a leading activity. If the student
body backs Buck Currie and the new
cabinet the results will be, a banner year
for the “Y.”

The cabinet for 1922-1923, as appointed
by President- elect Pat Crawford, is as
follows :

N.C. State Cinder Pack-
ers Were Too Strong

The Men From Raleigh Were in
Tip-top Shape and Outpointed
the Wildcats.

After a nip and tuck contest the far-
mers from N, C, State nosed out the Da-
vidson Wildcats in a rather slow track
miect on a soggy Sprunt Field last Fri-
day. In the early stages of the meet it
was impossible to state who would come
cut victor. Several times the score was
tied but finally in the last three events
the Raleighites were winners by a good
margin and nosed out ahead by a total
score of 74 1-2 to 50 1-2. Practically all
the records were slow and the weight
events were not up to standard, but this
can be accounted for by the soggy con-
dition of the track and the high winds
with their usual sand and dust which
prevailed. The Tech men won eight first
places while the Wildcats garnered but
six, The deciding factors, however, were
the seconds and thirds that mounted up
in the long run.

Knight was the individual star for the
Red and Black, winning first in both the
shot and discus. His discus throw of 121
feet 11 inches broke the ‘college record
by a total of six feet. Somebody had
better watch their honors in that State
meet or Big Knight will break several
more records,

Koenig showed up exceptionally well
in the dashes. He was nosed out in the
100 yard, getting only second place, but

in the 220 he_easily copped first.
Gracey, apparently, entered every-
thing. Although not winning a first

place, he placed in a great many and
showed his classmates what he could do.
With a little niore training he will make
an A-1 track man,

Blakeney and Park were the outstand-
ing point gatherers for the Ralcighites.
The former won the 880 when he wore
out Galloway on the second lap and
loped away with the two-mile without
seeming to impair his freshness. Park
roped in three first places, taking the
high jump, javelin throw and broad
jump. In the latter event McGukin
would easily have won first except for
the fact that he had strained his leg in
the high hurdles. Without overturning
a single stand he easily outdistanced
Homewood, State’s star football end,
and pulled down a first place. Rooster
McFadden surprised all his admirers
when he led his opponent by about 25
yards, winning first place in the low
