In many ways their lives
were as different as their
deaths. Myron was old and
white, a retired College offi-

black, having arrived in 1974
as a freshman. Myron had
discovered his vocation years
before George was_ born:
George was still on the verge

of that discovery, still testing

Myron leaves behind children

suffering and joy were of a
different tone, at least, from
George’s—the variations
being two themes of the as yet
unfinished Southern sympho-
ny. Their faults were disparate

By GEORGE MURDAUGH
Staff Writer

The Department of Trans-
portation has selected David-

son as a Model Bicycle City.
As a result, the Davidson

Bicycle Demonstration
Project has been organized
under the leadership of Ms.
Mary Dawn Liston.

“This distinction really am-
ounts to a challenge to
develop a model bicycle pro-
gram to show the state how
bicycle ridership can be in-
creased,’’ declared Liston.

Other primary goals of the
program are to increase rider
safety and to promote under-
standing of the bicycle as a

‘vehicle of many uses during

this age of conservation.

The DOT is supporting the
Bicycle Demonstration
Project with an initial one-
year grant which consists of
“software incentives” such as
films, registration materials,
planning aids, questionnaires,
plus other promotional and
educational materials. Two
consultants from DOT will
also be working with the
project.

Liston feels that she is
‘serving an umbrella func-
tion,’’ acting as a central
coordinator for the many fa-
cets of the program.

She has divided the direc-
tion of the project into two
main thrusts: the school aged
children in town, and the adult
residents and college students.

_According to Liston, the
P.T.A. and Davidson Police
Department will head up the
youth program. Bike skills
and safety will be the main
