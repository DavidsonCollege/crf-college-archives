The DAVIDSONIAN October 3, 1917

DAVIDSON’S SHARE SET
AT TWO THOUSAND

At the Student Y. M. C. A. Confer-
ence this summer at Blue Ridge the
conference voted to raise $100,009 this
fall for Army Y. M. C. A. and ‘secre-
tarial work. The canvass for this
amount is to be made about the ist of
October. In every state in the South.
one institution, has been selected and the
amount raised in that institution is to
serve as a standard for the other col-
leges and universities in that state. From
all the colleges in North Carolina, Dav-
idsen has heen selected as the standard
college. “wo thousand dollars is the
minimum amount to be raised here, and
with such a small student body it is go-
ing to take sacrifices on the part. of
everyene to raise such an amount and
keep up Davidson's “rep.” while at the
same time aiding in such a just and
needy cause.

At Blue Ridge, in discussing the réis-
ing of this fund, it was thought bese that
each college should make some sacrifice

At Davidson the Annual and Maga-
zine bring in the hest income. It is out
of the question to drop the Annual. The
Marazine is the only thing that could
be dropped.

But come outlet must be provided for
literary talent. “Chis talent might be ex
presced thru Tam Davinsoxiax, or
probably one special issue of the Maga-
zine might be oublished. “The question
as ta what will be done will be sub
mitted to the student body some tinve in
the near future.

GOOD ATTENDANCE
ATC. FE. SOCIETY

The meeting of the Christian [n-
deavor Society Sunday evening was espe-
cially interesting, the topic being “ Mis-
sion Work Among the Immigrants.” J.
A. Thames, the leader for the evening
showed that the thousands of immigrants
that come to our Jands yearly are a splen-
did opportunity for Christian service:
that if we would make good citizens of
them, we must first make them eood
Christians. By means of a clipping, “I
Am the. Immigrant,” Thames showed
that a large percentage of our mining
and manufacturing is done by = immi-
‘grants and they naturally look to us for
the Gospel as well as the necessities of
life.

Short talks were made by C. I. Al-
len, Hollandsworth, Orgain, Maddrey,
FE. G. Lilly and Burney, showing how
we can get better results in our work
among the foreigners, and also the
negroes, by more courteous treatment.

The attendance at this meeting was
especially good, and it is hoped that this
increase of interest in the society will
continue thruout the year.

_ The meeting next Sundav will be led
by T. L. Fowle. the topic being “Christ's
Yoke: What It Is and How to Wear
Ie.”

J. L. FOWLE ADDRESSES
: MINISTERIAL BAND

The Ministerial Band held its regular
weekly meeting Sunday night. In the
absence of G. C. Bellingrath, president,
the mecting was presided over by R. W.
Robinson, vice-president.

The speaker for the occasion was J.
L. Fowle, president of the Y. M. C. A.
His subject was “Christianity and the
Y. M. C. A.” He showed how the
two were linked together, and how all
other international organizations, such
as the peace leagues, had failed, but the
Y. M. C. A.. still stands more firmly
fixed than ever. He showed how Chris-
tianitv and the Y. M. C. A. agree. since
the Y. M. C. A. stands for: first, clean
lives; second, uplift of the mind; third.
the saving of men’s souls,

He stated that there are three ways
they could help the Y. M. C. A.: first
hy prayer; secondly, by personal work ;
and thirdly. by speaking for, it.

This talk was very impressive. and
‘nade a deep impression upon all who
Neard it, in that it was a challenge to
he Christianity in a man.
