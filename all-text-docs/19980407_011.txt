With all of the hype about Carolyn Kirsch
last season and the attention that Jen O’Brien
drew this year by putting together possibly the
best single season in Davidson basketball his-
tory, the Class of ‘98 women’s basketball players
have managed to go largely unnoticed.

Despite a clear lack of well-deserved atten-
tion, the three seniors on the team — Danielle
Mall, Jennie Vanlerberghe, and Jennifer Sanborn
— compose the most successful graduating class
in the history of Davidson women’s basketball.

The seniors won more games than any other
class in Davidson history, finishing with 51. The
50th came on Senior Day with a 74-63 win over
Appalachian State.

As sophomores, the members of the class of
‘98 were a part of the team which recorded the
first ever Davidson victory in the Southern Con-
ference. The women’s team had gone a com-
bined 0-21 against conference opponents from
‘93 through’95. In both the ‘95-’96 and ‘96-’97
season, the team finished at .500 (7-7) in the
conference.

This season, the seniors led a squad which
became the first Davidson team ever to post a
winning record in Southern Conference play.
The team finished 12-4 in the conference and 17-
8 overall, the best record in Davidson history.

Asolid rebounder and incredible shotblocker
with a good scoring touch, Vanlerberghe was a
force in the paint from the time she arrived on
campus. She finished her career with 836 points,
placing her fifth all time. She is also second
alltime in field goal percentage at 52.4%.

The 6-foot-2 center pulled down 399 re-
bounds in her career and averaged 4.1 per game.
Her point per game average was 8.8 for her career
and was above 10 in each of her last two seasons.

Vanlerberghe is without question the best
shotblocker in Davidson history. She finished
with 122 career blocks. This is by far the highest
career total on the Davidson record book. Kristen
Ferrucci, who is number two in this category, had
85 blocks in her-career.

in both single-season
blocked shots and single-
season field goal percent-
age. She had 34 and 39
blocks in her sophomore
and junior seasons, and—
shot 56% and 55.5% in
her junior and senior sea-
sons.

She also holds two
single game records. By
going 10 for 11 (90.9%)
against Army in Novem-
ber of ‘96, Vanlerberghe
set the record for field
goal percentage in ‘one
game. In that same con-
test she registered her
career high by scoring 23
points. In January of her
sophomore season
Vanlerberge set another
single game by blocking
six shots against
Marshall.

As co-captain in
both her junior and senior years, Mall was an
important factor in the locker room as well as on
the floor. In a program that has been plagued by
illness and injury, Mall played in 104 contests in
her career, missing only one games in four years.

As a tough power forward, Mall’s role on the
team was primarily defense and rebounding. She
pulled down 299 rebounds in her career (2.9 per
game) and had 75 career steals.

Mall totaled 346 career points in her career
(3.3 per game). Her 300th career point came on
Jan. 24th of this season against Woffort. In that
contest she went 4-6 from the floor and had eight
points. Her career high of 12 points came against
Western Carolina in February of her junior year.

Sanborn is one of the best shooters on the
team, and ihdeed in Davidson history. She was at
her best in her sophomore season, aver-
aging 19 minutes: and 7.8 points per
game. In the past two seasons, her play-
ing time has decreased due to the team’s
much improved depth and the influx of

skilled guards (i.e. Jamie and Kerry Brown, Jen
O’Brien).

She kept pace with Mall by playing in 104
games in her career and missing only one. She
scored 428 points in her career, averaging 4.0 per
game. Her career high was 23 points, which she
recorded against Georgia Southern in February of
her sophomore season.

Sanborn’s greatest asset is her three-point
shooting ability. In her career she has made 67 of
217 attempts from behind the arc. Her 30.1 career
percentage is fifth all time. Atthe beginning of this
season she ranked third before Jessica Montrella
and Jen O’Brien, who shot an incredible 50% and
45.5% respectively on threes this season, jumped
in the rankings to fill the top two spots.

Sanborn is also one of the best free throw

shooters in Davidson history. Prior to this sea-
son, she ranked first all time with a 79.2 career
percentage, and had a narrow lead over Jamie
Brown (77.9%). After going 9 for 15 from the
line this season, her percentage dropped to 76.1,
which is still an outstanding stat. She finished
fourth on the all time career list.

Sanborn ended her career on a good note as
she played her best basketball of the season at the
Southern Conference tournament. She scored a
combined 23 points in the two tournament games,
going 8 for 12 from the floor and 4 for 8 from
behind the arc. She was also perfect from the line |
in the tournament.

The record 51 wins set by the Class of ‘98
will almost definitely be surpassed by next year’s
senior class, consisting of Jamie and Kerry Brown
and Jessica Montrella. Nevertheless, the number
of milestones. that these..three seniors reached
will not soon be eclipsed. They became the
winningest class in Davidson history despite a 4-
23 freshman campaign. By posting three win-
ning seasons, they achieved a goal that in the fall
of ‘95 some would have thought was out of
reach. Each one left their mark on the program
which they so greatly improved, whether that
mark be in the record books or in the hearts and
minds of the fans.

Runners battle cold weather
plus 50 other teams at Duke

By Bratton HoLMes

A field of 50 teams ran in the 48-degree
weather at the Duke Invitational, a far cry from the
near 80-degree weather of last week’s meet. Mother
Nature has not been particularly nice to the Wild-
cat track teams. Neither has the schedule.

Among the teams at the meet were Duke,
Wake Forest, UNC, Georgetown, Virginia Tech,
and Syracuse. All of them are major conference
scholarship schools with lesser academic require-

ments for athletes. Davidson’s times in the events
were good, but the Wildcats finished in the top ten
in only a handful of events on the day.

One such event was the Women’s DMR, in
which: the relay team finished seventh overall
while breaking the school record in the event. In
the DMR, Clare Frey ran the 1200m, Jamilah
Sawyer ran the 400m, Kate Feldmeier ran the
800m, and Smyth Bitter ran the 1600m.. The relay
team posted a time of 12:27.

Jamilah Sawyer continued to show her im-
portance.to the team as she ran a season best time

in the 400m hurdles, finishing in 68:54.

Rookie Machelle Borders ran a personal best
time in the 200m dash. She finished in 29.30.
Three veterans - Beth Brewster, Jenny Klotz, and
Catherine Walsh - each posted season best perfor-
mances in the 5000m run.

Two more Davidson runners placed in the
1500m run. Feldmeier and Frey finished fourth
and sixth in the field. Their times were both
personal best. Also posting personal best were
sophomore Lisa Green and freshman Maggie
Barbosa in the 3000m.

Forthe men’s squad, the best finishes came in
the 5000m run. Brent Ferrell finished with a time
of 15:05.57, which is one of the top ten perfor-
mances ever by a Davidsori runner. Josh Cookson,
who has battled injuries for the majority of his
senior season, finished: second among the four

Davidson runners in the event with a time of
15:38.08.

William Isenhour’s time of 15:40.60 places
him on the top ten list of Davidson performers in
the 5000m. Pat Burchett was last of the four
Davidson runners in the event, finishing with a
time of 15:51.56.

In the Steeplechase, Senior Tim O’Keefe
posted a time of 10:18.52, improving on his time
from last week’s meet by just over 15 seconds.

The 4x400 relay team of Keith Chapman,
Addam Marcotte, Mike Albert, and Ade Artis
came within one second of posting a new season
best. At last week’s meet, Chapman, Albert, Artis,
and Karim Lawrence posted a time of 3:29.80.
This week’s team finished in 3:30.64, less than
one-eighth of a second away from a new season
best.
