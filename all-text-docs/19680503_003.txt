EMBODIED

UNC psychology professor Harold G. McCurdy, a defender of
the existentialist viewpoint in psychology and author of a
textbook used in Psychology 22, told an audience of 100 stu-
dents and professors that behaviorism erred in not accounting
for a self. McCurdy’s approach allows for a disembodied self
and accepts the normally-excluded idea that free will is a
relevant psychological concept. (Staff Photos by Weems.)
