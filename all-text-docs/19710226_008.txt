College Takes Fifteen
In Exchange Program

Fifteen students, including
three males, have now been
accepted by Davidson for at-
tendance next year under
the Eight College Exchange
program.

Director of Instructional
Development Jay H. Ostwalt
has~ emphasized, however,
that ‘although we've accept-
ed them, it doesn’t mean
that they've accepted us. It
is not yet certain that all of

-. them will cdéme here next

year.”

_Ostwalt, who is Davidson's
representative on the plann-
ing and functional commit-
tee of the exchange pro-
gram, pointed out that one
girl accepted at Davidson
last year chose at: the last

Housing A imsAnnounced

By STEVE CROSS
Copy Editor

‘Better housing for married
students, special accommo-
dations for the coed ex-
change girls, and major re-
novations for Cannon, Duke,
and Richardson dormitories
are the top student housing
priorities for next year, ac-
cording .to RHA President
Bill Alexander and Student
Housing Director Scotty
Nicholls.

(Mrs. Nicholls said that
Cannon Dormitory would be

‘renovated in a style ‘‘very
-similar to what was done in
East.’’ The change would in-
clude new wardrobes, furni-
ture, drapes, and lighting.
The details of the Duke
dormitory renovation are not
yet settled between Mrs.
Nicholls and Grover (C.
Meetze Jr., director of the
physical plant. But ‘the bath-
rooms will definftely be im-
proved. ‘‘The bathrooms are
very bad,"’ she noted.
Alexander said, ‘The
SGA and RHC will work
wery hard while I’m in of-

22 Picked For
Freshman Halls

Twenty-two hall counselors
and three alternate counse-
lors have. been selected by
Housing Director Scotty
Nicholls, Dean of Students
William H. Terry, and this
year’s senior hall counselors.

The counselors are Bruce
Baird, Bruce Batten, Gerry
Bello, Joel Bradley, Jimmy

Brown, Mait Browning, Dick |

Clay, (Mike ‘Collins, Mike
Creasman, Scott Davidson,
Robert Dawson, Larry Dun-
can, Randy Ely, Ken Jones,
Rob Krebs, Ralph Peeples,
John Robison, Bruce Sny-
der, Rhett Talbert,’ Seaton

Taylor, John Weathers, and .

Robert Wright.

The alternates are Tom
Dover, Steve Shepard, and
Rich Wilson.

Mrs. Nicholls added that
she is “trying to improve
the selection process. There
will be more emphasis on

training to help them to do‘

a better job."

‘Among the training inno-
vations, she said, ;was a sen-
sitivity training session or-
ganized and led by Dr. Me-
redith Hall, student psycho-
logical counselor.’

“There will be some other
kinds of training for them
before September,"’ she ad-
ded, including a meeting in
the-spring-to give-out ‘‘back-
cround information.”’

The counselors are all ris-
ing juniors on the recom-

mendation of hall counselors
in the past who have been
counselors for two years.

According to. Mrs. Nicholls,
the senior hall counselors
often get married or leave
school early, which is bad
because ‘‘there is a need for
hall counselors throughout
the year.’’ She added that
Dean Terry also favors the
change.

fice to make married stu-
dents’ housing livable.”

He praised the report on
married students housing
done by Tom Robertson and
Brent.cuane last May.. The
Robertson - Lane report
recommended the esta-
blishment of an on-campus
apartment-style facility for
married students and their
wives,

Alexander expressed dis-
pleasure with Mrs. Nicholl’s
decision not to house next

year’s. freshmen in Belk
dormitory. ;

‘He said the RHC under
outgging chairman Cecil

Burney had voted to house
the freshmen in ‘Belk, and
that Mrs. Nicholls and Dean
of Students William H. Ter-
ry had made a contrary de-
cision without consulting the
RHC. d

“Hopefully there won't be
any freshmen in Belk,” said
Mrs. Nicholls, citing. the
long halls, ‘‘one lounge for

300 people,” and ‘‘the lack |

of unity you get in freshmen
halls.’’

(Mrs. Nicholls added that
double room rent will rise
from $300 to $350 next year.

ating the two issues.

The new president said
that “in the future, we will
be much, much more care-
ful about how we negotiate
with them (speakers), espe-
cially about money.”

DuRant said that, although ©

his objections were a com-
bination of money and of
the particular speaker, he
would not have objections to

spending a like amount of
ee

money for a speaker such as
William F. Buckley because
the well-known: conservative
editor of National Review is
“‘a recognized leader,”

DuRant said that no de-
monstration was planned for
Davis’ appearance, and that
he was not even planning to
go see the controversial
speaker. No heckling or
Jeering was on tap, and
none would be instituted by
him.

. moment not ‘to attend.

Two of these accepted
havell't even applied: yet be-
cause of a slight mix-up, but
Ostwalt said that both wo-
men, students at Sweetbriar,
had expressed a definite de-
sire to attend Davidson next
year.

The Davidson committee
concerning the exchange
program has found it neces-
sary to change its previous
policy concerning students
that it accepts. The commit-
tee had originally stated
that only juniors who would
be able to stay the full aca-
demic year would be accept-
ed. ‘
Under those restictions on-

ly six women students would -

have been accepted, so the

- policy was changed.

Concerning the acceptance
procedures, ‘Ostwalt said
that he felt that any student
who could do the work at
the other participating
schools should be allowed to
come to Davidson under the
exchange prdgram,

Six women from Mary
Baldwin, four from Hollins,
and the two from Sweetbriar
have been accepted and ap-
parently will attend next
year. Randolph-Macon will
send no students.

‘Hampden - Sydney, '

Two of the men come from

looking
for certain courses in the
natural sciences. that they
cannot get at their home
school.

The other male is from
Washington and Lee. Ac-
cording to Ostwalt, he will
attend Davidson because of
certain ‘“‘family connections
and relations.”’

The: women will stay in
the recently renovated Gray
House, across the street
from the Cunningham Fine
Arts Building and the guest
house. The men will live in
the dormitories.

Only Washington and Lee,
with 29 applicants, had more
Students apply than David-
son. Among the other parti-
cipating schools, Hollins had
12. applications, Rando}ph-
Macon had four, and Sweet-
briar had four. There were
no _ applications . to Mary
Baldwin, (Hampden-Sydney,
or. Randolph-Macon (wo-
men),

Davidson had more parti-
cipants this year than any
other school, according to
Ostwalt.
