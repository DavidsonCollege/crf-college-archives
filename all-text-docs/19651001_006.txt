Davidson Lauds
Liberal Arts

By ALLEN WEBB
Davidsonian Feature Writer
“Some colleges have tried to place a sheepskin curt-
ain between themselves and society,” complained Dr.
Carter Davidson in an address before the student body

Tuesday.

In beginning his address, the
president of the American As-
sociation of Colleges elaborated
on the three diciplines of the
liberal arts curriculum: ‘the
physical sciences, the social
sciences and the humanities.

In doing this he drew parallels
between the three great-men of
the nineteenth century — Ein-
stein, Marx and Freud — and
their counterparts 2400 years be-
fore ~— Pythagoras, Confucius
and Buddha.

Next the former college presi-
dent discussed American higher
education in general. He defined
the college as ‘the instrument
by which civilization continues
and improves itself."’ The liberal
arts college intends to build
“the kind of world we believe
in.’

such,.as typified by the temper-
ance and fortitude of St, Thomas
Aquinas. He also stressed a faith
in morality that creates rather
than destroys.

Aer the assembly a coffee
hour was held jn the Union. At-
tended by annumber of reporters,

Davidson was questioned on the |

controversial N. C. Speaker Ban

Law.

Dr. Davidson branded the law
as ‘‘anti-intellectualism” but
went on to say he did not believe
NC schools should be penalized
by loss of accreditation because
of it.

“The law is not the fault of
the institutions involved.’ David-
son said, and.it would be a
“pretty severe penalty’ if the
Southern Association of Colleges
decided to take away accredi-

Clark Attacks Negro Leadership

Draft Tightens Up On Students

By JIM COOLEY

Davidsonian Statf Writer

Draft boards across the
nation are looking more
carefully at requests for
student deferments due to
a November draft call of
38,450, according to F. W.
Hengeveld, college registar.

This increased draft call. the
largest since the Korean -War,
has been made because of the
increased committment in Viet
Nam. Although the - Selective
Service has no intention of stop-
ping deferments, for college and
university students, draft boards
will be calling some,deferred stu-
dents who are not. attending
School full time or who are not
making satisfactory progress in
school.

Hengeveld reports that his of-
fice has just completed and

mailed 850 forms to the Selec-
tive Service boards. These forms
certified that the students

named were enrolled at David-

son and were carrying a regular
class load. The forms. Henge-
veld stated. would be. distribut-
ed to local boards which, in turn,
would issue a deferment status
of 2-S.

Hengeveld further added that
any man reaching 18 did not
have to return home to register
with his local board, but could
do so in the registrar’s office,

The facts remain that, because
of the increased calls, local
boards are rapidly running out
of single men between the ages
of 19 and 26. Since married men
without children are considered
the. same as single men, they
will be the fext group to be
drafted. °

Borderline students may also

be drafted, as was the case dur-
ing the Korean War. This means
that draft boards could require
a certain level of academic
achievement in order for a stu-
dent to maintain his deferment.

The highest classification in
the draft is stiff for those who
are ‘‘delinquent’’ under the Se-
lective Service Act. The law
says a registrant must furnish
the board information within 10

Fellowships Combine,
Still Have Problems

The Westminister Fellowship,
the Methodist Student Move-
ment, and the Canterbury Club
have combined this year to form
the Student Christian Fellow-
ship.

This organization, according
to George Brown, a member of
the Westminster group, is the
result of an: idea proposed by
the YMCA's Committee for Re-
ligious Life and of action on the
part of the local ministers.

During the spring term last
year, this committee met with
students and ministers of the

-| local churches, One proposal of

this group was that an interde-

.|nominational student fellowship

would serve better than three

separate fellowship groups.
However. Brown said that the

Y never took any action to im-

- !plement this suggestion, and dur-

ing the summer the ministers
went ahead and acted on the
proposal,

The decision was made that

the meetings would be rotated
each ‘week among the three
churches. Basically the groups
would have their separate or-
ganizations but would come to-
gether for meetings each week.

Several problems must be re-
solved, however. Brown said,
“We are not sure what direc-

tion it (the SCF) will take: It
may continue to have the com-
bined meetings or perhaps, may
expand beyond the regular Fri-
day night meeting into other
teligious activities. And then
if we do expand, we are still
not sure to what extent."
Commenting on the SCF’s pro-
gram plans, Ross Brown, a
member of WF, said, ‘‘It is
completely in the twilight zone.
Outside of this Friday night's
meeting, I don't know whether
it will continue.”
Will Terry, advisor to the
! YMCA, said that he knew noth-
ing of the SCF other than what
was discussed in plans last year.
According to Terry, Buck Lawri-
more is in charge of this sec-
tion of the Y's activities, but

never been consulted. Buck went

like to have an association with
them, but they haven't asked.

days of any change of status or
address.

A new law, signed on August
31, provides a $10,000 fine or
five years in prison for anyone
who destroys his Seiective Ser-
vice card, This new law came as
a result of student demonstra-
tions protesting the war-in Viet-
nam during which draft cards

were burned or torn up.

The performance will take
place in the Quadrangle in front
of the Cunningham Fine Arts
Center. A second program will
be at the same hour on Sunday,
Oct. 10.

Works scheduled for per-
formance are. from light operas,
Broadway musicals, as well as
popular music, marches and
ballads,

Officers include Jack Walker,
president; Dan Crocker. vice
president; Dr. Grier M. Wil-
liams. associate professor of
music, conductor.

Enrollment Stays
Steady Near 1000

This year, as in the past, Dav-
idson has continued to maintain
its small-college atmosphere by
putting a limit on the enroll-
ment.

Present enrollment of the en-
tire college, according to Regis-
trar F, W. Hengeveld, is 1001
students. Included in this num-
ber are 278 freshmen, 264 sopho-
mores, 210 juniors, 233 seniors,
12 Richardson Scholars and 4
special students. This number
does not include the 25 juniors
who are studying abroad this
year.

The great variety among the
students is indicated by the 34
states and 13 foreign countries
which they represent.

There are 366 men who hail
from North Carolina; there are
also, however, 105 students from
northern and western states.

(Editor’s note: Last week
THE DAVIDSONIAN carried
the first part of a two-part
article by Associate Editor
Johnny Clark concerning his
impressions of the Los Angeles
riots which occurred while he
was in that city last August.
Following is the concluding
part of his article.)

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Only a minority of the
Negroes of the city were ac-
tually participating in the
riots, but I was completely
amazed by the failure of the
Negro “‘civil rights” leaders
to condemn the actions of
the rioters. They would only
offer, “Of course I don’t
condone the violence, but
. 2’ and proceed to list
Negro grievances, some
valid and some not so valid.

While holed up on the roof one
night, we watched the Joe Pyne
Show (sort of a local Jack Paar
Show) during which one radical
Negro ‘‘spokesman”, an eXx-
Black Muslim, actwally defend-
ed and praised the acts of the

?

rioters, as businesses continued
to burn and people continued to
die. True, he didn't speak for
the majority of the Negroes, but
the segment he did speak for
was able to commit $200 mil-
lion worth of damage, in addi-
tion to causing 37 people to die
senselessly.

The other Negro leader on
the program, called an ‘‘Uncle
Tom" by the extremist, did
voice the sentiments of most
civil rights leaders and other
champions of the oppressed. He
said that he did not condone
the violence, but that the
violence was the result of
“police brutality’ and many
other oppressions of the Ne-
groes and not the fault of civil
rights leaders’ tactics.

Even Governor Pat Brown,
who seemed to be sort of a Calli-
fornia Lyndon Johnson, refused
to condemn the rioters, blaming
instead the LA police depart-
ment and Mayor Sam Yorty,
with whom he had long been at
odds, Like LBJ, Brown is a poli-
tician first, last and foremost,
and he knew the risk of possibly
alienating many liberal votes,

Even as people died, he con-
tinued to play politics and re-
frained from condemning those
who included among their civil
tights the right to steal, burn,
destroy and even kill.

No. most of the Negro civil
rights leaders did not conscious-
ly want the violence, but what
did they expect? As the articu-
late Negro writer George S.
Schuyler wrote, “The net result
of (the civil rights leaders’)
long encouragement of civil dis-
obedience, disdain for authority
and general disrespect for pub-
lic morals was to set the stage
foy the successful disgraceful
orgies of burning, looting, van-
dalism and death, with the crim-
inal elements of the slum’ prole-
tariat taking over. Ironically,
when police called upon these
civil rights leaders to help con-
trol the rampaging mobs, they
were (if found) completely inef-
fective.” :

Will Herberg, the noted Jewish
theologian, wrote that those such
as James Farmer and Martin
Luther King, ‘‘the inciters to
law-defiance in the name of

‘conscience’, are ultimately re-
sponsible for the riots."

Los Angeles attorney Morton
B. Jackson added, ‘‘They (the
rioters) had been encouraged
to believe that they were only
taking what was rightfully theirs
and what had been wrongfully
withheld from them all these
years. They had been told that
they were being willfully sup-
pressed, so they were getting
even.”

The Negroes of Watts did have
some valid complaints, most of
them concerning lack of oppor-
tunity. But how they or their
“leaders’’ who refused to con-
demn their actions could think
that anything could justify their
actions of violence, I don’t know.

The Negro leaders’ refusal to
condemn murderers and looters
seemed to indicate a silent ap-
proval as the riots mounted in
intensity to their peak on Satur-
day and Sunday. Certainly, the
only effective discouragement
the rioters received were the
bullets and bayonets of police
and National Guardsmen.

Law and the respect of the

general populace for law and
order is the foundation of our
civilized life. The advocation of
disobedience to laws which one
considers ‘‘bad"’ can only lead
to other situations like LA,
Rochester, Harlem, and Spring-
field. Justice Felix Frankfurter
has said, ‘If a man can be al-
lowed to determine for himself
what is law, every man can.
That means first, chaos; then,
tyranny.”

Martin Luther King and all
the would-be M. L. Kings did
not have to fly out to LA to
find their scapegoats. They just
had to open their eyes.

Admittedly, a lot more under-
standing and a lot more giving
will have to occur on both sides
before this mess is settled.

Yet. the Negro will achieve
the respect he wants, along with
the understanding and the giv-
ing. by showing, as many Negro

leaders have already done, a

capacity for responsibility rath-
er than a capability Lor precipi-
tating disrespect and disobed-
fence for the law which, how-
ever imperfect it may be, 1s the
foundation of our civilization.
