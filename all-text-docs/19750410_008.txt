By MARK POSTOVE
Staff Writer

-The Davidson track team
evened its record at 3-3 for the
season -with a victory over
Washington and Lee here this
past Wednesday.

The win followed losses to
Richmond and Campbell on the
road.

In the Richmond meet,
Davidson took only three firsts
and six seconds in the nineteen
events. The powerful Richmond
team swept five events to run
up a 123-40 advantage.

John Stanfield won the high
jump and placed second in the

 ., javelin. Allen Schaberh cap-

tured his first win of the year in
the discus, as did Bob Lauten-
sack in the steeplechase.

Mark Connors, although
weakened by bronchitis, grab-
bed second in both the 100 and
220 dashes.

The meet with Campbell was
held in winds so strong that the
pole vault had to be-decided by
a coin-flip because it: was too
dangerous to jump. Times were

Tennis Cattes boast two wins,
Drake looks to bright future

The Davidson College
Women’s tennis team has begun
its second season and the
forecast looks good.

Coach Pat Drake, taking over
the helm this year, expects an
improvement over last year’s
record and envisions an even
stronger team next spring.

To offset the loss of last year’s
strong number one player,
Mary Miller, Drake has a hun-
gry bunch of freshmen this
year, two of whom, Naricy
Brown and Andrea Murphy, are
playing in the top six.

Depth is a positive aspect of
the team this season. The Cat-
tes are solid down the line ac-
cording to the coach.

“On the team, my numbers
four, five, and six should be con-
sidered strong.”’

Drake will be counting on
these players for consistent
wins.

Sophomores Becca Stimson
and Sue McAvoy hold down the
number one and two positions
respectively:’ Though they will
be facing some outstanding
players, Drake affirms, ‘“‘On a
given day, Becca can knock off
anyone she wants to, and Sue is
very consistent.’’

The Cattes are a young team,

and will graduate only one

player this year. With a little
bolstering by next year’s fresh-
man class this team could be
very tough.

The record at present stands
at 2-2, with wins over Wake
Forest and Converse. The Cat-
tes have only lost in a heart-
stopper to Radcliffe and a.
rather decisicive defeat by the
powerful Carolina team.

‘In the first match of the
season, the Cattes topped the
Wake Forest team, 5-4, where
the doubles strength of the
Davidson netters proved to be
the deciding factor.

Dea Booth teams with Sue
McAvoy for the number one
team. Stimson and hard-hitting
Brown form the second team,
and Andrea Murphy and Ruth
Murphey make up the third
pair.

Coach Drake will depend on
the strength of these teams in
the tight matches. ;

The schedule this year is
similar to that of last year. Of
the remaining matches, ‘‘Ap-
palachian, Furman, and South
Carolina will all be tough
teams, and of the three, Fur-
man will be the toughest.”’

Drake continued, ‘“‘We might
heat South Carolina.”

It is her belief that teams:
should earn attention before
receiving equal treatment. The
bright future of the women’s
tennis team should help her in
attaining that goal

The Campbell Camels hum-

ped their way to victory,
though, sweeping three events
in route to an 86-59 triumph.

Davidson was strong in the
running events, winning six of
eight individual events. Con-
nors and Greg Love were
double winners, with Connors
taking the 100 and 220 while
Love hurdled his way to victory
in both the highs and the seldom
run 180 yard lows.

Freshman Dick Boehner won
the 880 while Coty Pinckney ran
well despite the wind to out-
distance his opponents in the 3
mile.

The only winners in the field
were Stanfield and Schaberg, in
the high jump and discus,
respectively.

Davidsonwon eight of the ten
running events, and added
three wins in the field to over-
power Washington and Lee by a
score of 87-58.

Connors again won both
sprints, running an excellent 9.7
in the 100, and added a second in
the long jump. He. also ran on
the winning mile relay team,
which clocked 3:25.3 for its
fastest time of the year.

That team included freshmen

Boehner, who won his third 880

The Wildcats did well in both
the hurdle and distance events,
outscoring W&L 39 to 6 in the
two hurdle races, 880, mile, and
3 mile.

Ricky Bell won the mile in
4:26.8 and finished third in the
three mile. Pinckney won that
event in 15:22, while Lube Deal.
took second, giving Davidson its
only sweep of the day.

Love and Bob Trumbo led a 1-
2 finish in the high hurdles,
while an obscure hurdler and
Gary Danciger did likewise in
the intermediates.

s *
Stanfield and Schaberg each
recorded their third straight
wins in their events. Stanfield
leaped 6’4’’ to take the high
jump, and also placed second in
the javelin.
