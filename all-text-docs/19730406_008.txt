Davidson Athletic Problems Presented
CRISIS IN ATHLETICS:

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

(Ed. Note: This is the first in
a series of articles dealing with
the problems facing athletics at
Davidson College both now and
in the near future, concluding
with an examination of the
possible alternatives to these
problems.)

With the recent meeting of
Davidson's athletic minds at
Montreat. N.C.. it seems to be
the proper time to investigate
the athletic program in a
detailed manner.

The purpose of this series ts to
inform the public ot the con-
ditions of the sports program
here. included will be a look in-
to the Monetary aspects of the
programs here. the problems
encountered in recruiting and
competing. the rising costs ot
athletics. and the alternatives
to the continuing problems of
college athletics in general.

In this first part of the series.
some of the problems con-
fronting athletics at Davidson
are presented

One ot the more pressing
problems in the Davidson
sports alignment is the cost of
funding the various teams

A Davidsonian Analysts

February 1970 the Board of
Trustees voted to make
available trom the college's

general funds a “sum equal to
52 times the average grunt
made to non-athletic grant
recipients. ~

This “average non-athletic
grant’ comes to somewhere in
the neighborhood of $1000 per
player. Adding this total to the
$106.766 raised by the Wildcat
Club, it leaves the college with a
deficit of about $14.000 for
scholarships. The college
agreed to provide this extra
amount. under the stipulation
that this vear would be the last
time it would be done

The college must also con-
tribute an estimated $159,363 to
the program this vear to balan-
ce total expenses with income

The tab tor basketball that
must be picked up by the
college comes to a projected
sum of $139.235

a

“Monev is one of the biggest problems facing in-

tercollegiate athletics.

Be will definitely have to make

some cutbacks somewhere. It is just a matter of time to see
which sport will be hit. F guess football is the one most

people expect to see cut.”

=—Tom Scott
Director of Athletics

a

Figures released earlier this
year showed that the total ex-
pense of the football program
comes to $348.139 (This is a
projection ot the tinal tigures. }

The estimated income trom
all sources tor the program was
$188.776 This includes $82.000
from game receipts and
Zuarantees as well as $106.776
from the Wildcat Fund. to be
used tor scholarships

The tootbali team used
$171.776 tor scholarships = In

Income for basketball from
ticket receipts and guarantees
Was an estimated $130,800.
Total projected expenses were
$270,035

The minor sports and in-
tramurals have no income
Thus they are entirely tunded
by the college The total here ts
about $181,000

Talking with Athletic Direc-
tor Tom Scott. it seems ap-
parent that there are problems
in other areas of athletics

besides money

To begin with,
there is ia

Scott added that the coaches
are very good al accepting
this principle and living by it”

~Acadennes have hurt us in
our fight to get a biz man tor the
basketball team). Scott cited as
an example That is the
biggest reason tor our. slight
decline in basketball) We just
need a big Manin the middle ~

Assistant) Director of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid
Wilham Miller concurred with
Scott

“We do not have any double
standards for the selection ot
students and athiet es.” he said

-Our main consideration ts
whether or not we feel thes can
cut the mustard here. We are
not going to go out and admit a
seven-footer if we do not think
he can make the grades and be
happy here.”

Miller continued on to outline
the general procedure in selec-
ting prospective — student-
athletes

It is the same method as
selecting regular students. The
college is concerned with what
the student hus to offer the
college with regard to extra-
curricular activities, as well as
to the ability of the college to
fulfill the needs and desires of
the student in his college life.

He also agreed with Scott on
the idea of coaches staying
within the admissions policies.

“The coaches are very good
in staying within the standards
here at Davidson.” Miller com-
mented “They look all over the
country for ypood  student-
athletes Tt the admissions
department feels that a certain
prospect. cannot succeed at
Davidson. the coaches are not

Perhaps the best way to
describe .the overall per-
formance of the rile team this
season rs tremendous im-

In the recent Southern Con-
ference tournament the
shooters copped 1232 of a
possible 1500 points to finish in

seeded seventh going into the
competition

Jim Faggen led the team with

McCloy tollowed at 253

In the Southern Invitational
Regional Tournament. the Cats
went in seeded 24th and came
out with a upsetting 12th place
finish

It would seem that ino the
future, this Competition ts going
to become even stitter

The purpose ot subsequent in-

to continue to examine the total
sports picture at Davidson and
at other institutions. and then to
analyze each ot the present and
future possibilities with regard

Miller concluded by saving
that) the only way the ad-
Missions standards could be
bent would be threugh the con-
sent of the Faculty -Admissions

But he added, ©

A third problem of athletics ts

crisis mm athletics

(Next Week: A careful prob-
ing into the financial aspects of
major college sports in general,

athletic budget at Davidson. fn-
cluded will be an examination
