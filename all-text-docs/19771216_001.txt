CRC to reevaluate policy

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

Speaking to an opinionated
gathering of at least 75 stu-
dents last Miday, Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs
Price Zimmermann explained
the Curriculum Requirements
Committee's recent tightening
of the guidelines governing
whether or not a Davidson
student is allowed to take a
reduced coursé load.

The CRC less than a month
ago decided that simply being
courses ahead is not just cause
for allowing a student to take
a reduced course load. This
decision, a departure from
past procedure, has stirred
opposition from a number of
students, some of whom are
now courses ahead and hope to
take a reduced course load in a
future term.

‘‘There’s a lot more to a
Davidson education than what
one can find in the halls of
Chambers--a student taking
two courses can take time to
learn from the College com-
munity;’’ ‘‘Davidson is pater-
nalistic and does not respect
the student’s ability to deter-
mine the academic program
that best suits his needs;’’--
these and other opinions were
voiced as student after stu-
dent sharply criticized the
CRC’'s decision during the
one- hour meeting.

Students select newleaders,

Zimmermann said later that

was ‘somewhat surprised
by the number of students at
the meeting and the intensity
of the questions.”

He said he had gained a
better perspective of the stu-
dent viewpoints in the three
course matter and said he
would report the students’
sentiments to the CRC.

“TIT expect the CRC will
devise some means of bringing
the matter up before the
faculty.’ said Zimmermann.

At the close of the meeting,
SGA President Thom Young
recommended that the CRC
reformulate the three course
policy to 1. allow juniors and
seniors to take a reduced
course load with the consent of
their faculty advisor, and 2.
allow freshman and sopho-
mores to take a reduced course
load if the CRC decides they
have just cause to do so.

Zimmermann said later that
he ‘“‘can sympathize’ with
Young's proposal.

“If the requirement for ta-
king a full load is to be relaxed
solely on the basis of being
courses ahead, it would be
most appropriate to relax the
requirement in the case of a
sefiior, next most appropriate
in the case of a junior, and so

on, Zimmermann said.
Young hopes that the CRC
will recognize ‘‘that juniors

and particularly seniors are in
a special situation (i.e. they
have already determined a
major and are taking upper
level courses) and should be
granted underloads if they are
ahead in their courses."

He also believes that ‘now
would be an excellent time for
the CRC to come out with a
statement on the philosophy
behind requiring three courses
so we can vet the school to
work together toward a com-
mon educational goal.

I was really glad to see the
student interest at the meet-
ing and I felt the students’
questions were well thought
out,” Young said.

Duncan to edit Davidsonian

By GEORGE MURDAUGH
Staff Writer

Election week at Davidson,
and the ushering in of a new
generation of campus leaders;
brief interviews with the win-
ners of the four contested
campus-wide elections follow.

Junior Philip Duncan, selec-
ted by the students to be
Editor of The Davidsonian,
plans to bring out 1978's first
Davidsonian on Jan. 20.

‘During the week of Janu-
ary 9-14 we will be recruiting
new staff members and build-

that will enable us to produce
a quality newspaper from the
outset,.”’ Duncan said.

He urges.all who are. interes-”

ted in working for The David-

“about taestjot

sonian to drop by.the newspa-
per office soon after they
arrive in January.

Lyman Collins, Duncan's
opponent in the election, will
serve the newspaper as Exeau-
tive Editor. Duncan is cur-
rently selecting the others who
will work with him and intends
to announce further staffing
plans early in January.

Junior David Barnard was
elected as the new Union
Social Vice-President. He will
officially assume that position
immediately following mid-
winters weekend.

“TI think this transition
period is a good thing,’ Bar-
nard said. ‘‘Right now I'm
getting oriented to how the
Union operates. This situation
doesn't put me under pressure
right away.”

He said that while he is
being ‘‘educated"’ about Union
operations he is making plans
on the organization of Union
committees. He is also ‘‘re-
cruiting”’ people to be on those
committees. _

‘I'm very. very excited

he concluded.

The election for Freshman
Advisors was decided in the
run-off on Wednesday. Fresh-
man Advisors for 1978-1979
will be juniors Doug Horn and
Nancy &éConnachie.

‘We're so excited,’’ AéCon-

close race."

‘We appreciate the job even
more because we had to work
so hard to get it,’’ Horn
explained. ‘‘We reconfirmed to
ourselves how much we really
wanted it.”

47.5 per cent of the students
are satisfied with the entree
less than 30 per cent of the
time. Students objected espe-
cially to the small portions,
the poor quality of the meat,
and the frequency of hambur-
ger, either by itself or incorp-
orated into other dishes.

Director of ARA Services
Ron Scott has pointed out that
budget limitations must be
taken into consideration. Sla-
ter has begun using fresher
cuts of meat, but larger por-
tions would involve consider-
able expense.

Some of the meat.Slater
buys has had 4 per cent soy
protein meat extender added
to it, but Scott says that the
humburgers served do not
contain soy protein.

Some students feel that
they are not receiving nutri-
tional meals. They blame this
on the overabundance of
starch and the overcooking of
vegetables. 56.6 per cent
found the vegetables poor or
very poor.

Scott points out that Slater

follows a menu prepared by

dietitians, and the meals

therefore are nutritionally

sound. Scott says that he will
try to cut-down on starches
and serve more green vegeta-
bles to determine what stu-
dents prefer.

Vegetables are re-used once
if they have been left over
from another meal, and this
re-heating sometimes makes
them appear to be overcooked.

Ahy students would ‘like to
see more fresh fruit available.
Scott points out that this was
tried in the past, but that it
proved to be very expensive
because students took a large
quantity of fruit back to their
rooms. Scott is willing to try
this again.

A mifmber of students have «

complained.that Richards and
Bailey Houses often close
before the appointed time.
Scott does not feel that this is
true, although he does plan to
check if Slater time and school
time are the same.

As for the problem of over-
crowding, Bailey House will
not be opened Sunday even-
ings as some students had
suggested. Instead, Richards
House will open one-half hour
early to accommodate stu-
dents from 4:30 to 6:30 Sun-
day evenings.

Scott also suggests that
students use Bailey on other
nights if Richards is crowded.

94 per cent of the students
have encountered the problem
of the cafeteria running out of
food, leaving no dessert or
choice of entree or vegetables.

Scott does not think that
this figure is a true reflection
of the situation, but promises
to work on “‘production prob-

lems."

Scott believes that student
opinion is important to his
operation because ‘'students
can point out areas we're weak
in, areas where we should do a
better job.”
