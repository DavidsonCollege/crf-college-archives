Faces

Landry Kosmalski

Kosmalski, a 6-7 power for-
ward from Bedford, Tex., has made
an immediate impact for the Wild-
cats, stepping to the forefront of
this year’s outstanding rookie class.

He recorded a double-double
in an exhibition game versus the
-Global Sports All-Stars, his first
college action ever, scored 18
against the Charlotte Royals last
week, and came through with a 16-
point, 10-rebound effort yesterday
in the season-
opening 87-73
victory at
| Fairleigh-
Dickinson.

As an
Academic All-
S:tater’
Kosmalski led

Trinity to the
Texas state championship, aver-
aging 20 points and 13 boards.

His father, Len, played in the
NBA with the Kansas City Kings
and Chicago Bulls.

“He’s playing like a veteran,”
lauded McKillop. “I think he’s
made a statement already about
how talented he is. Id like to see
if there’s a better freshman in the
Southern Conference.”

Davor Halbauer

Halbauer brings a soft long-
range shooting touch to Davidson
from basketball-rich Croatia. The
6-3 shooting guard averaged 17

points and 8 assists for his junior

club team in Zagreb.

player on coach McKillop’s ros-
ter, along with

Cameroon
and Ali Ton
from Turkey.

“Davidson
is anice place.
I like it,” said
Halbauer.
“Everybody knows each other.
That’s the good thing about it. Here

you can meeta lot of people. That’s
a very good experience for me
because everything is new for me.

“Tt was difficult at first. Still
now I don’t speak good English. I
am happy because my teammates
and all the people here, including
professors, they really help me to
understand. Without these people,
I don’t think I would learn so fast.”

points and 10 rebounds last year at

much of the preseason with Hepa-

Ibs. as a result of the sickness, will
resume light activities in a week or
so, but will likely not see game -
action for an-
other 2-3
"| weeks. :

“Stephen
is as solid as
we can get in
the post here at
Davidson,”
said McKillop.
“We are very pleased with what he
did in the preseason and optimistic
about what he’s going to do during
his career here.”

" “T’d like to be one of the best
teams that Davidson has ever had,”
said Marshall. ‘““Hopefully we (the
freshmen) will be one of the best
classes that’s ever been here and
win the conference championship
and an NCAA bid. Maybea few of
them.”

Everybody’sAll-American Tim Duncan, Deaconsloom

By MIcHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

The men’s basketball team
faces the first of many stern early
non-conference tests on Friday
night, traveling
to Winston-Sa-
lem for a 7:30
matchup with
the Demon
Deacons. of
Wake Forest.

pel ass t
year the Wild-
cats posted one of their best season
in decades, winning 25 games and
earning their second NIT berth in

three years.

But the Deacons boast some
formidable recent history as well.
They have recorded a school-best
26 victories and top 10 national
finishes in each of the past two
years, captured back-to-back ACC
tournament titles - the first school
to do that since 1982 - and ad-
vanced to the regional finals in the
NCAA Tournament last March,

falling there to eventual national —

champion Kentucky.

Even better for Wake, 6-10
center Tim Duncan, the premier
collegiate player in America,
bucked the ever-increasing trend
of star underclassmen jumping to

the NBA and decided to stay on
campus for this, his senior year.

Duncan was a third-team All-
American as a sophomore and a
first-teamer last year and garnered
national preseason Player of the
Year honors this fall.

NBA coaches, who projected
Duncan to be the No. 1 pick in last
year’s draft, have dubbed him the
national Defensive Player of the
Year the last two seasons.

As the Wake Forest media
guide asks, “Is there more for him
to accomplish?”

Apparently Duncan eh
there was.

“Being a part of Wake Forest

and the basketball program here
has meant a great deal to me the
past three years,” said Duncan. “At
this point in my life, I feel the best
thing for me is to remain at Wake
Forest for one more year.”
_ That decision has virtually
single-handedly kept the Deacons
(currently No. 3 in the AP poll) in
contention for another conference
crown and even anational champi-
onship.

The prolific rebounder and

shot-blocker represents a tremen-
dously tough assignment for any
opponent, and it will be no differ-

ent for Wildcat center Chadd
Holmes and the rest of the Davidson
front line.

Senior Ricky Peral (9.4 ppg
last year), a 6-10 swingman, and
junior point guard Tony Rutland
(7.2) are also keys to Wake’s suc-
cess.

“Tim Duncan is a really good
player. No question about that.
But we are not frightened by any-
body,” said freshman shooting
guard Davor Halbauer. “If we can
play like we know how to play, I
think we can win this game. We.
always have a chance if we play

like we know how.”
