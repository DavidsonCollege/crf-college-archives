bit towards making the Davidson R.

good knowledge of all phases of the
work. Those attending this class

plé, Rogers, McFadden, Breitenhert,

geants. This class is to meet every
Monday night in the military room
in the gymnasium, and all those con-

PROF. FULLBRIGHT
LECTURTES ON LITERARY
VALUE OF THE BIBLE

At the last meeting of the Sigma
Upsilon, Professor Fullbright spoke.
His subject was “The Literary Value
of the Bible.” He showed in his
speech that the Bible contained
some of the finest expressions of lit-
erary talent that could be found in
the world today.

Some of oyr finest poetry is found
in Psalms. The finest, Epigram in
Proverbs and the savings of Christ.

He closed by showing that the. Bi-
ble could not only be prized because
of its hope of salvation, but because
of its literary use:

All the members enjoyed his talk
very much. At the next meeting
criticisms will be held on the Da-
vidson College Magazine and a few
current books and stories: _

EU.’S INSTALL OFFICERS
PHI’S FAIL TO MEET

Many Boys Absent on Account’ of
Sickness—Live Meeting in Eu.
Society.

Eu. Society Saturday Night.

The meeting of the Eumenean So-
ciety on February 7 was interesting
and lively, despite the fact that many
members were absent. The question
fer debate, “Resolved, That the [i-
ble should be taught in the public
schools of America,” required, of
course, somewhat different. treat-
ment by the two sides. The affirm-
ative relied upon eloquence and per-
suasion to carry their side, while the
negative depended more on. reason
and argument. Baba, of the affirm-
ative, opened the debate with a plea
for the Bible, based on its literary
execHence. Price, the next speaker
for the affirmative, asserted that he
had six points to prove. But he
based his argument mainly on the
one proposition that the Bible was
the foundation of. all society, law
and ethics, and maintained that the
foundation deserved as honored a
place as the structure based upon it.
The last speaker for the affirmative,
Gamble, overluoked the rules of de-
hate which prohibit quoting the Bi-
ble. He referred repeatedly to pas-
sages in the Bible, presenting them
as authority. The first speaker of
the negative was Meng. He-show-
ed that teaching the Bible in the
public. schools would be, in’ spirit
and principles-contrary to the con-
stitution. H. H. Smith, the second
speaker for the negative, held up for
consideration the low — estimate
which publics school pupils would
place upon the Bible, were it made
a text-book. Sorrels had been ap-
pointed o nthe negative. at the last
minute,and” ‘delivered =the final
speech. He argued that’ it would
be impossible to find teachers who
could teach the Bible in a manner
satisfactory to everyone; no Prot-
estant would be willing to have his
children taught the Bible by Ath-
eists, Jews, or Catholics, and vice
versa. The decision of the judges
was in favor of the negative.

The program closed with an ora-
tion by R. R. Craig on “America’s
Place in the World Today.”

| The new officers were then in-

Stalled, But, the inaugural addresses
were postponed, in order that the
society might be able to attend the:
basketball game.

Moiiday Night.

The Monday night section of the
Eumenean Society held its regular
meeting in the. society hall at thei
usual hour. The subject which was’
“debated was: ‘Resolved, That the
| Bible should be taught in the: Pub-

lic Schools. On account of the dis-
turbance caused by the influenza,
the attendance was not large. Those
present looked quite conspicuous
among so many vacant seats. °

The argument for the affirmative
was upheld by Manning and Hough- .
ton, while the negative side was de-
fended by Mauze, T. W., and MeAl-
pine. Mr. Manning contended that
the question was a most practical
one, while on the contrary, Mr.
Mauze took the law into his hands
and stated the unconstitutionality of
the proposal. Also, in) turn Mr.
Houghton stated the..fact that. the
Bible was used in all state affairs
and that people in general do not
understand the Bible. in the proper
light. Therefore it shopld be placed
on the curriculum of instruction in
public schools. All this, only to be
contradicted by Mr.. McAlpine upon
the statement that Bible is too com-
plicated a book, both historical and
literary, to give pupils of public
schoul age sufficient instruction in
the subject. The committee ap-}
pointed to weigh the merits of the
debate, after considerable delibera-
tion, agreed that the affirmative ar-
gument consumed more time, but]:
that neither, side had proved any-
thing, Fhe house showed its dis-
approval by favoring the negative:

Mr. Hollandworth, gave the sec-
ond installment af his series of A. E.
I. speeches. His subject: this time
was “Pershing’s Own.” Due to the
neglect of the president in tot ap-
pointing a critic till late in the pro-
gram, and at that time appointing
Mr. Flollandsworth, proved quite
amusing. tle criticized his own or-|
ation, and after a few remarks thor-|
oughly convinced himself (it seems)
also the audience that without doubt
his was by far the best speech of the
evening. |
“The society after attending to a
little business adjourned, much to!
the relief of all present.

Miss Rena Potts has returned ti’
her work in Bishopville, Ga. She
has been visiting for several: weeks
with relatives here and has just re-

‘cently made a trip to Baltimore and

New York. |
