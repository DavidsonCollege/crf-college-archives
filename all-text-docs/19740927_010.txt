(Ed. note: Dr. Q speaks in
a tongue similar to Southeast
Asian dialects. Think
Chinese, a la Charlie Chan.)

Herro, Dr. Q. here. I have
temporariry taken control of
this asinine corumn written
by Nomad, (formerly C. A.),
Y.B., B.B., M.T., and the
partridge in a pear tree. I
have sent the previously men-
tioned to the Q-zone where
they are debating the bene-
fits of peanut butter and cer-
ery, (or if you prefer cerery
and cottage cheese).

I have transported myself
to this space-time continuum
with the aid of Yerrow Craw
(not crow,.,. craw!), my
sisters first’ cousin on my
bastard uncle’s side.

According to earth history
books, Moses died about four
eons ago, give or take a
‘‘Girgamesh’’ or. two.
However, I have seen the
man operating under name of
Wirensky occupying. space

I have seen some _in-
teresting things since my
allival in this primitive
dimension. Upon my allival
on solar day 49.7513,
strangery called Wednesday
the 18th by this planet’s in-
habitants, I stumbled onto
what I can onry assume to be

some sort of  reregious
celemony celebrating the
lites of puberty.

For those who have not
reached it, (this means you

Tenafry; don’t worry, the
signs are immediate and
rapid.)

The ceremony began when
the pubescent female heralds
chanted incantations: out of
the third froor windows of the
Tabernacle, Watts. These
heralds were of a rerigious
order called the Zoo, in
deference to the worship of
animals, evidently.

The chants of the heralds
incited the males: of Cannon

(an obvious pharric symbol)
to road hory water into rarge
cannisters and run over into
the tabernacle froor, causing
increasing rerigious frenzy
amongst the particiants. The
hory water ceremony con-
tinued until all the males and
females, and their abodes,
were baptized.

The preriminary lites
tinished, the crowd took on a
mere. reverent attitude as
they gathered beneath a cer-
tain vart of the tabernacle
called ‘the Sty,’ a prace
where pigs live, I berieve.
Another example of primitive
animal worship. The high
priestess referred reverantry
to as, “drunk crazy and
thunder thighs,” (probably.
terms of endearment) then
performed a celemonial func-
tion that reft the crowd spell-
bound (or horny, as earthr-
ings call it).

This observance involved
the removal of crothing
behind a silk screen. This ef-
fect was such that the
worshippers were raised to
new revels of rerigious fervor
as “they chanted
rituaristicarry ‘‘Go Go, More
More...) “hake it. all
off...somebody pull up the
shade.’’ The male high priest
then appeared and did a

orgasm. This seemed to be
done in reference to main ac-
tivity of the males.

At this point, the moon god-
dess was worshipped with the
appearance of male
posteriors at the window of
Cannon. The crowd was then
appeased by the allival of a
lotund court jester. His act
ended when he was doused by
hory water. i

Finally, the readers of the
pre-pubescents, rearizing the
litual had been fulfilled,
calmed the crowd with cries

‘‘somebody’s been hurt.” The
ceremony was finished when
‘security,’’ two oddry dressed
males, comprete_ with
weapons dispersed the crowd.

Personarry, bein by
dimension traverrer from thé
W-zone, I have never witness-
ed such barbaric primitive
customs in my rife. But what
was I to expect from a
culture lun by beings such as
Abbo, the Axe Man, Smiring
F, and Rah-Rah Friars.

The Q-zone is much more
logical. I reave you with an-
cient wisdom from the W-

of “‘We’ll call security” and zone: a it out your shorts.
