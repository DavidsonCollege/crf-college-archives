Subject of Guidance Talks

Following three weeks of the siiGtaieyl|
Business careers, and Journalism Glicaial
sions the “Y” will present as the subject |
of the fourth week’s discussion, Law. The!
subject of Law as a life career will be;
treated as have been given the discits- |
sions on the other subjects. There will,
be one general talk on the entire subject |
of Law and on the other nights of the
week a detailed discussion wil! be given
of several different phases of the Law.
The principal speaker on the subject of
Law. will in all probability be S. Clay
Williams. Mr. Williams is the chief coun-
sel of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Com-
pany of Winston-Salem, N. C. Mr. Wil-
liams will speak on Wednesday night,
which has been set aside as the chief
night for the Vocational Guidance Insti-
tute talks. S. Clay Williams is an old
Davidson alumnus and an eminent lawyer
in the state. Although it is not entirely
certain that Mr. Williams will spe
the Wednesday night session,
by stated that he was practically certain
that he would be able to be here and give
his message to the Davidson students,
On other nights in the week devoted
to Law talks will be given by men who
are experts in their-chosen line. There

ak at
Jim Apple-

will be four other talks besides the main
speech on tnd eenersL-jet of Law,
these will be def} d on different nights |>

during the week. The detailed subjects to
be treated are Criminal Law, Civil Law,
Corporation Law, and another talk will

be given by a Prominent man in

. Judiciary
Circles.

Jim Appleby said that

so far no one had been heard from as to
whether they would be able to come to
Davidson during that week and speak be-
fore the students.

ht to Davidson to
speak to the students who are interested
on the subjects of education, which will
be the theme of the fifth week’s program.

University of South Carolina, and the |
brother of the Professors Douglass of the
Davidson faculty, and George Howard,

cine as a life profession will be discussed
by several men of that calling. Among
those being considered for the principal
talk are Dr. Rankin, of Rochester, and
Drs. Lafferty and Moore, of Charlotte.

Officials Hope To Discover
Atheletics

Although complete details will be work-
ed out later, it is evident that Coach Monk
Younger of Davidson College, might have
some unheard of and unsung athletes add-
ed to his various squads in the years to
come, if the proposed plan of physical
education goes into effect—and it seems
likely that it will.

The Davidson board of trustees at its
recent meeting here authorized. the em-
ployment of a director of physical educa-
tion, and at the same time approved sug-
gestions offered by the faculty commit-
tee along that line. It is proposed to re-
quire all Davidson students in the junior
and senior classes, who are not taking the
advanced R, O. T. C. work, to elect some
One of the numerous sports for a’ period
of three months, giving a certain amount
of required time each week. In other
words, it is believed that the proposed
plan will eliminate the usual type. of
specific setting-up exercises.’

Authorities at Davidson stated that they
hope to employ the physical director with-
in a short time, his work beginning in the
fall with the opening of Davidson. Hid-
den athletic ability and prowess might
come to the forefront under the director’s
tutelage.

JESUS IS SOLUTION

(Continued from page 1)
fervent prayer, honor, chastity, and truth are
all sacred things for which it is better to die
fighting than to fail to cherish, There is.a
great challenge today for anyone who seeks
to follow Jesus in the face of the world’s
scorn, but this will serve to make victory
more glorious.:

Slang Said To Be
Akin to Saxophone

“Slang and the saxaphone are kin, for
they both serve as means to express every
mood—free or tense—of the human
heart,” writes Dr. Frank H. Vizetelly
managing editor of the New

’

Standard

| Dictionary, in an article called “Slang:

the Saxaphone of Speech,” in the Daily
Princetonian.

Dr. Vizetelly does not under-estimate the
forcefulness of slang, neither does he
join the purists in denouncing it ds val-
garizing the language. “What has been
said of slang in the past holds good for
the present,” he writes, “for it is, and has
been little else than, a direct product of
the spontaneous combustion of the emo-
tions, caused by a bursting of the bonds
of restriction that conventional life has
imposed. It is really the ‘side show’ of
speech which may, some day, win its way
into the ring, and there prove the’ chief
attraction, The people who think do not
find it hard to cite examples of this, and
college slang is full of it.”

Yet for all this there are difficulties in
the way of anyone who would officially
adopt the new terms. Dr. Vizetelly con-
tinued;

“In our academic institutions we have
much slang that is virile and snappy, yet
to one who devotes himself to the study
of English, the redundance of unauthor«
ized words and bizarre expressions fre-
quently proves a source of unutterable an-
noyance and vexation. Should he take
advantage of what he sees and hears in
his own day, and incorporate into the lan-
guage the frippery gathered through
daily contact with the affairs of life or
through familiar conversation with his
fellow men? If so, then the very first: to
condemn him would be the literary critic,

Chapel Talk

Statement Concerning
Maxton Junior College

Corrects Newspaper Reports in

WISHES INSTITUTION
SUCCESS

| Neither Spoke for or Against
| Establishment—Matter for
Synod’s Decision, He Says

Newspaper reports crediting him with
| whole-hearted advocacy of the junior col-
|lege project recently agreed to by mem-
'bers of the Presbyterian Synod of North
Carolina at their meeting in. Maxfon,
| Prompted Dr. W. J. Martin, president of
{Davidson College, to explain his position
lin a talk to students of the college at a
‘college at a recent chapel service.

“T regret that I have been quoted as
| having spoken whole-heartedly in favor
| of the establishment of a junior college
!at Maxton by the North Carolina Synod,”
|Dr. Martin declared. “I stead- |
'fastly refused to enter into any con- |
troversial discussion of this subject since |
,it was first suggested, and have never ex- |
pressed myself as being for or against the
establishment of the junior college.

“Only after Davidson College had been
referred to as being benefitted and
harmed by the establishment of this col-
lege at Maxton did I rise to my feet at!
the synod meeting and make clear the
position of the president and administra-
tive officials of Davidson. IT explained to
the delegates that Davidson would never
stand in the way of the establishment of |
a school or college by the Church, that
Davidson considered herself the servant

have

|

and he would not lack any of them to}
tell him that he had recognized insulfer- |
mother |

able vulgarity and debased the
tongue.’—The New Studerit,

of the Church and not the master; and
that she would never play the ‘dog in the
manger.’ If the Presbyterians decided to
establish the college, then Davidson would
do everything to assist.

“I did take opportunity, however, of
urging upon the synod the danger of un-
dertaking the establishment of a junior
college unless they saw their way clear
to raise sufficient funds to give the school
an endowment necessary to make it an
accredited institution. ‘There is no reas-
on why the church should undertake to
support another college if she can’t see
her way clear to do so,’ I told them. It
will be a big mistake to undertake this

project if it is going to to result in a half-
dying institution, too poor to secure the
equipment and the faculty necessary to
win it an accredited rating.’ I want you
young gentlemen to know that I did not
speak in favor of the junior college, and
that I did not speak against it. That was
a matter for the Synod to decide, and not
for the president of Davidson College to
dictate.”

Dr. Martin closed his remarks by say-
ing, “Now that it has been decided to have
the junior college, I sincerely hope that
every Presbyterian and friend of Chris-
tian education will rally to the support
of the new institution, and make it a
success.”
