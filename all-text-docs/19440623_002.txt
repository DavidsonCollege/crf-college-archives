the question of compulsory attendance
at vespets is far from a’ new one on the
Davidson campus. If we could lay all

the bull sessions and arguments held on

the subjeet end to end, nobody knows
what we would have, but it would be
something impressive.
— The perennial diseontent has blossom-
cd again, as the diligent reader with ob-

required vespers, it is extremely doubtful
that any change will be made in this rule.
This is not because the administration is
simply bull headed. There are some pret-
ly good reasons for their policy, or they
would not upheld it against persistent
protest.

he is robbed of his freedom of worship.
If he doesn’t wish to worship in the man-
ner accepted at Davidson, he is under no
obligation to enroll here. lFurthermore,
he does not have to use the hour spent in
Chambers Auditorium for worship unless
he wants to. “You can lead a horse to
water but you can’t make him drink:”
This point is illustrated very well by a
number of disgruntled students at vespers
cach Sunday. The fact remains, however,
that the large majority present at vespers

; do gel soniething from the service, as is
he Summer Session

indicated by the survey referred to above.

What if vespers were made optional?
Would the majority of students still at-
tend church here or elsewhere Sunday
night? Probably so. But the number at-
tending would detinitely be lessened by the
intluence of plain, old, laziness. It is much
casier to hang around the dorm than it is
to dress and go to Chambers and give
thoughtful attention toa sermon. Most of
the present Davidson student body is com-
posed of boys who are just beginning to
make decisions of their own. Here is one
of those boys who is glad there is some-
thing to keep him from making the casy
choice instcad of the right one.

Probably the most unpopular feature
of Davidson Coliege from the standpoint
ot the student is the Sunday night vesp-
ers. This is not an inexplicable condition
when you realize that these vesper serv-
ices, regardless of how proficient they
may be, are a violation of the most prized
right of man—{reedom of worship. When
they are made compulsory they become co-
ersive measures of telling a man what
church he must attend, when he must at-
tend it, and how often he must attend it.

Vespers when forced upon a man be-
come detestable. The student attends

that one of'the primary aims of Davidson
is to develop the Christian character of
its students. Few people will question
the wisdom of this aim. The college at-
tempts to achieve this aim by establishing
good habits in its students. Among these
habits’ is that of regular church attend-
ance, and the desire to form this habit in
the student is at the root of required
vespers. .

Of ‘course, one may well argue: that
forcing a man to go to church serves only
to increase his determination not to go
when the compulsion is removed: That
is a very nice point, but is has one slight
weakness: it is not true in the majority
of cases. A recent survey of alumni of
Davidson “bears out this point. The
number of Davidson graduates who are
not chtirch members is amazingly small.
In addition to this fact the number of
Davidson alumni who are church officers
is amazingly high. Thus statistics show
that the policy of required church attend-
ance has not alienated men from the
church at all, but has been eminently suc-
cessful in establishing the church-going
habit in the personal lives of students.

It must be granted by the most pious
soul that compulsory vespers rob the stu-
dent of a certain amount of freedom, He

cannot choose what he will do with the

those things that you just have to grin and
bear. The idea becomes fixed in his mind
that these religious services are distaste-
ful. No one will doubt that these services
are defeating the very purpose they were
inaugurated to support, namely, instill-
ing students with the desire to attend
church. Did the Puritans support the
Church of England because it was the
only one they were allowed to publicly
attend?

ling students, sweating under superficial
coats and ties, entered Chambers Audi-

It Could
Be Worse

By ROBERT MORRISON
Hark, oh ye men of Davidson, to
a tale of woe—the true story of
why I came to this fair institution

and the misery lett behind me.
{twas a fair day in May; the air
was melodious, and the birds were
refreshing. The local high school
set had spent the day out at one
of the boy's cabin on the Catawba
River. Sweet were those days of an-
tiquity. Oh, but | would not re-live
that day for life itself. The woman

in five hours. a

When | arrived at Davidson the
load had increased dn the bus so
much ufat when the driver opened
the door three A.S.T.R.P. boys fell
out. and were nearly trampled to
death. The only breaths | took from
-Charlotte to Davidson were when
the driver stopped to fet us walk
across the railroad tracks.

tugged slowly up toward the dormo-
tories and, suddenly 1 heard someone

say “Get off the grass you ***+*-

dorm, after moving off the grass.
Suddenly some big tall upper class-
man “tame up to me and said,
“Freshman have you paid for your
privilege to walk on the sidewalk?”
When 1. told him no he said that
would be two%dollars. I put all my

When. I opened it I found my friend

TL turned and fled.

Yes, brothers, this is why I came

my sorrow and to eke out a misera-

About 12 that night there was a
