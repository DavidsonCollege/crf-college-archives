ness empire. Johnson’s class,
charm and his reputation for giv-
ing freely of his time for public
appearances make his HIV-posi-
tive testeven more ofatragedy. As
he himself said, though, it is these
same qualities that will give him
the ability tochange the way people
approach AIDS.

Johnson told Hall that “I’m
still Magic, you’re going still going
to have to give me hugs and high
fives.” Magic will be hard to treat
as an outsider, and this should make
the treatment of-other AIDS vic-
tims better.

Because of Johnson’s imme-
diate recognizability, his fight with
the disease will give every person
in America, sports fan or not, per-
sonal contact with the disease.
While I’m not going to touch the

theological issue of whether or not
Johnson has been picked by God to
be a spokesman for the disease, if
anything good cancome out of this
event, it will bea heightened aware-
ness of the disease.

Johnson’s positive outlook has
shown that he may be one of the
few people in the world with the
strength to turn such a personal
tragedy into a triumph for society.
While it is sad that such a brilliant
basketball career could be cutshort
by a terrrible disease, Magic is
seizing a unique opportunity to
achieve more off the court than he
ever did on the court.

I hope that Magic can keep up
the optimism even when the dis-
ease manifests itself in its full horror
and we are forced to watch a great
athlete wither away. Everyone
needs to say aprayer for Magic and
pay him the respect he deserves by
taking his message to heart.

Soccer

Continued from page 13

The ‘Cats were forced to find
other scorers. Sophomore Ben
Hayes was converted from a de-
fender to a front line player and
adjusted well to his new role. He
finished the year with 6 goals, but
no other Davidson player had more
than two. In fact, the team as a
whole scored two less goals than
Ukrop tallied last season. Also, the
team managed almost 100 less
shots on goal this season.

Next year, however, expecta-
tions will again be high for the
‘Cats. Ukrop will return after re-
dshirting this season. With his re-
turn, Coach Slagle is hopeful that
the powerful offense of 1990 will
also be back.

The team will, however, lose 3
important seniors. Midfielders
Lance Long and Spider Wormuth
and goalkeeper Doug Long all had
excellent careers and will be
missed. Wormuth was recently
recognized as a member of the All-
Big South first team for his play
this season.

The ‘Cats, however, should be
able to fill the gaps left by these
graduating players. Midfielders
Andy Schwab, Lance Kinerk, Andy
Haile, Mike Newton, Bryce Smith,
and John Sampers will be asked to
step up and assert themselves next
season.

Freshman Alex Deegan, who
shared the goalkeeper spot this year
with Long, will have the job to
himself next season. Deegan had
the best statistics among Big South
conference goalkeepers this sea-
son, with a goals against average
of just 0.87.
