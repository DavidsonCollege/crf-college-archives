Mid-winter celebrations in 60-70 degrees?

What's a poor freshman to make of this mysterious holiday?

By LIZ DAVIDSON

Sometimes it’s hard being a freshman
here at Davidson. People never tell you
anything or else everyone tells you
something different. Obtaining infor-
mation from people is confusing, frus-
trating and sometimes downright em-
barrassing. We freshmen sit around a
lot, just trying to figure things out.
For instance, why were we the only
ones dressed up for the first home foot-
ball game? Where doall the sophomore
girls go Friday and Saturday nights?
(We never see them at parties). We
never really learn anything until we’ve
experienced it ourselves. For example,
maybe it’s not a good idea to stand
straddling the sides of the stairway at

PiKA — you could fall. Or the guy that
walks us back to our room at 3:30 a.m.,
when the parties have all ended, isn’t
interested in the decor of our rooms—
believe me, he already knows.

Likewise, Midwinters wassomething
we all had to learn about. It all started
out as a big mystery. The questions
were endless. Would we have to dress
up? Would the parties be closed or
open? Would they conflict with The
Indigo Girls concert? No one seemed to
have any idea. Plans were made at the
last minute, if they were made at all.

“I thought the Sig-Ep formal was Fri-
day night, but it was Saturday. I was
almost ready to go Friday when I found
out,” freshman Dair Brown told me,

laughing.

At PiKA, there seemed to be even
more confusion.

“I had no idea what to wear, what we
were doing, what time to go, what to
expect, period,” freshman Jane Mount
confessed.

The party Friday night wasa Mexican
theme, and no one seemed to know if
they should wear sombreros and baja
rugs or the more traditional coat and tie
and cocktail dresses.

What Happened

It was a confusing weekend. Some
dates were separated and future ones
were made. Some of us woke up in
places we had never seen before. Others

got to bed before 12 a.m. The bands
were great or lousy, depending on
where you were. The houses seemed
emptier than I had expected, and I kept
wondering where everyone had gone.
However, beer was plentiful, and there
seemed to be few complaints. In gen-
eral, nothing went as planned, maybe
because very little was planned. Most
students, however, seemed to have had
fun. That was the general consensus of
the freshmen I interviewed.

I wonder if we will be better prepared
next year. What will we tell the fresh-
men? Those of us who remember the
night will have 10,000 different things
to say, and the confusion will start all
over again.

ory and our subconscious is
tied up in all that. It’s not a
Christian ideal though, it’sa
spiritual one.”

Indigo Girls’ basic mes-
sage, said Ray, is “self-es-
teem. Learn to believe in
yourself and everything
else will fall into place.”

Other recurring themesin
their songs are “self-aware-
ness and knowledge.” Ray
said their music advocates
increased emphasis on in-
ner-self education
and cultural, politi-
cal and environ-
mental awareness.

Ray and Saliers’

musical personali-
ties create a stun-
ning duet in part
because of their
complementary
styles. “We're re-
ally different from
one another” said
Ray. “I’m the more
emotional, to-the-
punch type.
Emily’s a little
more grounded.”
,’ Ray continued, “I
was always the
manager early on.
Emily was the one
who taught me har-
monies.”

However, both

women “are involved in all as-
pects” of their music. “We got
help from other people when it
[their success] got too big to
handle,” said Ray.

One of the basic requirements
of life as a musician is lots of
road travel. Playing the club
circuit is essential in achieving
name recognition.

Ray professed to “like that
circuit a lot. People are sitting
right in your face. If you havea
good show, you know it was
good. If you have a bad show,
you know it was bad. It’s a very

honest, bare-bones situation.”

“Theaters are a great place
for ballads,” said Ray, while
“concert settings can give you
a raw, emotional edge.” She
said that she and Saliers enjoy
both kinds of settings: “We
vary with what we're in the
mood to play.”

Ray and Saliers enjoy living
on the road. “It/snotas hard as
having to go to work at 9:00
a.m. We're lucky that wedon’t
have to do that!”

The precarious life of a mu-
sician does not frighten Ray.

“It doesn’t scare me at all. I
don’t really care. I could get a
job at Pizza Hutif I had to. We
feel really lucky because
we're healthy and have at
least average minds.”

Money isnota priority with
the group. “Happiness is our
only priority,” said Ray.

However, continuing to
produce good music is an-
other major priority of the In-
digo Girls.

“We just want to make al-
bums and be satisfied with
each one,” said Ray. The

band’s third LP should sane
this September, and Ray and
Saliers plan to work on it this
summer in Los Angeles and
Athens, Georgia.

They will again enlist the
aid of Scott Litt, who pro-
duced their last album and
who has also worked with
R.E.M.

When Indigo Girls tour
again this fall, they will seek
to expand their target audi-
ence. “College kids are the
largest percentage of our
fans,” admitted Ray.
“They’re our peer group.”

However, she said, “We’d
like to have some more high
school kids and older people”
listening to the group’s
sounds.

Ray had some advice for
young fans who want to.do
more than just listen to music.

Aspiring musicians should
“try to get into a studio as
soonas possible. Doa record,
do everything you can do on
an independent level. If you
understand the process,
people won't take away your
spirit.”

Although Ray freely ac-
knowledged that breaking
into the music business is dif-
ficult, she said, “Just believe
in the music. There’s lots of
negative things that can hap-
pen inside you. They can be
channeled . into positive

things.”
