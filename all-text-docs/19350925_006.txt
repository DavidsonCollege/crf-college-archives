THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 25, 1935

Big Teams to Have
Bitter Race This Year

(Continued from Page 4)

Some aver that thunder and lightnin’
aint nuthin compared to this cowboy from
the wilds of Idaho, which reminds David-
son that in two or three nights there'll
be a hot time between wild cowboys and
Wildcats.

Things look bad to Coach Jim Weaver
and his ample assistant Herman Hick-
man. In spite-of extensive advertising for
a blocking back, a punter, and some-
thing to replace the heart and trimmings
of last year's team, the Deacon mentors
have found little, so they say.

Meanwhile, others beginning to
think different. It’s evident since the
Duke game last Saturday that one of the
best passing attacks in the state is that
of Wake Forest. The Deacons gained 116
yards to Duke’s 0 from passes. Dallas
Morris and Walt Kitchin are all Weaver
could want.

Davidson supporters may take heart in
the fact that a new backtield is. now ris-
ing to fame. Watch these cats pull a sur-
prise.

have received recognition because they

of Carolina newspapers.

to pass, was thrown for a twelve yard
loss. After another incomplete pass for
Davidson, the ball went over on downs.
They tried a line plunge and a pass, and
then another pass, which Wood Burns
intercepted. He was downed on the forty
yard line. The Wildcats were hammering
away on the Elon 32 yard line when the
final whistle blew.

he was very much interested in was that
of soil erosion and reforestation. It is to
be commenced very shortly, and the work
will be done chiefly on the outskirts of
the Davidson campus.

In summing up his views on the NYA
program, Prof. Fleagle pointed out that
the work serves the double purpose of
keeping students out of the ranks of the
unemployed by giving them something
to do, and at the same time enabling them
to continue their education.

We have on hand at all times

The pleasing aroma and flavor of Turk-

a good cigarette.

Turkish tobacco is more costly when
you take into account that you have to
pay 35c a pound duty, but we have to

have it to blend with our mild ripe home-

grown tobaccos.

It helps make Chesterfields milder, it
helps give them better taste. Just try them.
