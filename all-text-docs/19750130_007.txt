Thornton Purges Communist Threat

By THOM NICOLL
Associate Editor
E.P. Thornton has not stop-
ped his tireless campaign
against One-Worlders, the
United Nations, and the World-

Communist conspiracy. ‘Some

people have missed his efforts
to balance the political
viewpoints to which they are
usually exposed.

I was wondering if Mr. Thorn-
ton, of Murrell’s Inlet, S.C., had
retired from his ideological ac-
tivities and called him Tuesday
to check on his current status.

He reassured me that his ef-
forts on behalf of free en-

terprise and the U.S.. Con- .

stitution have not abated.

On the contrary, the reason
that he has not been too con-
cerned with Davidson lately is
that he has gone national: his
newspaper column in published
in places as far away as Salt
Lake.City, Utah.

However, during 1970-72, Mr.
Thornton was a prolific con-
tributor to the letters column of
The Davidsonian. He also
bought a full-page ad in April of
’ 1971, after plans for him to
speak here had fallen through.

The topics of Mr. Thornton’s
contributions varied, but the
main thrust was consistent:
college students, the leaders of
the future, and especially
Davidson students were being
misled and brain-washed by
liberals who associated with the
Communist party, the Renee
Davis, Abbie Hoffman set, and
others who were making it their
life-work to attack the U.S. Con-
stitution and the free enterprise
system.

The text of the full-page ad
also implied that the publicity
for Mr. Thornton’s up-coming
speech at Davidson had been
deliberately undermined
because of his conservative
views. .

This practice, he told me
Tuesday, is widespread among
liberal in colleges and univer-
sities, and he said he knew of
another specific case at David-
‘son where a_ conservative
speaker was the victim of such
audience manipulation.

Mr. Thornton first began
writing to The Davidsonian to
respond: to letters in the
Charlotte Observer by
Professor E.F. Patterson.

In the April 16, 1971
statement, he _ grouped
Professor Patterson with Nor-
man Cousins and the Chicago 7
as his chosen ideological ad-
versaries.

“T know for a fact that you
have tenured professors at
Davidson who do not believe in

“These professors,’’ he
claimed, ‘‘take kids to
Washington to help try to shut
it down.”

A professor who. challenges
the right to private property,
for example, is attacking the
Constitution, according to Mr.
Thornton, and there ought to be
a way to get rid of him.

way,’’ hesaid.

I asked him about the colleges
and universities now, compared
to three years ago.

“In general,’’ he told me,
“‘they’ve changed for the worse.

didn’t know whether these
students were .any more
patriotic than they had been
before.

The Russian Communists are
just as active as ever, ac-
cording to Mr. Thornton, and
still intent on taking over the
world. He cited. the En-

cyclopedia Britannica article

on Communism for this fact.

Examples of their influences *

include sex education for young
children, and the ‘‘degradation
of the public schools by busing,
which doesn’t work, and which
lowers academic standards, ac-
cording to Mr. Thornton.

He said that many colleges
are having to simplify their tex-
tbooks and -lower their stan-
dards so that the incoming
students can grasp. the
material. I replied that this
didn’t seem to be the case at
Davidson.

Mr. Thornton said that
private schools like Davidson
should not allow the federal
government to finance
anything, because it would use

its funds to blackmail in- .

stitutions into submission, as,
he said, it has done in Chicago
and Boston.

“The federal governemnt
shouldn’t complain about the
Arab oil-states because it black-
mails its own people.”’

A great threat to the U.S., Mr.
Thornton states, is the U.N.
“We are coming under the
jurisdiction of the U.N., which
is run by countries who want to

Tuesday.

He explained that he was. op-
posed to tenure being granted to

professors who use that protec-

tion to make attacks on the U.S.

Constitution and on the free en-

terprise system.

Mr. Thornton said that he
knew of Davidson alumni who
wanted the college to get rid of
such professors, but who had
met with no success.

“I’m extremely conservative,
and I get a lot of mail that shows
that a lot of people feel the same

He also cited the “horrible
materials” that Princeton gives
its entering students.

I mentioned the decline in
‘“‘radicalism”’ on campuses. Mr.
Thornton attributed this to the
end of the draft, and said that he

Mr. Thornton was asked if he
ever found himself agreeing
with the liberals on particular
issues, such as illegal C.I.A. ac-
tivities.

He replied that it was a
question of the C.I.A.’s motives,
and that he wouldn’t want to see
the C.I.A. weakened.

“After all,
