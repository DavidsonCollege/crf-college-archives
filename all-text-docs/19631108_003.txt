Side Lights

BASKETBALL ...

The days of basketball have arrived, Hearalded by
the many magazines at the Hub and the rose-colored
glasses of the Charlotte News, Davidson's winter winner

as come.

The consensus of opinion of the basketball mags is
that Davidson is a slight underdog to beat West Virginia
for the Conference championship, that Duke is ranked
2 or 3 in the nation, that Fred Hetzel is some kind (either
second, third or honorable mention) of all American, and
that Dick Snyder is one of the top sophomores in the
country.

Meanwhile back in reality all is not quite so easy.
Early season practice has already seen two injuries.
Terry Holland has a broken nose and Barry Teague an
injured knee.

In addition to this, basketball at Davidson right now
is a lot of hard work, late meals and shin splints. However,
the future presents a somewhat more interesting outlook.

There are several games this year in the Coliseum.
A schedule that includes several well-known basketball
powers, the first “Who can name it?” Christmas tourna-
ment, and the Southern Conference finals.

Quite a number of big-time, high pressure basketball
games will be played by this year’s team.

There is no doubt of the talent on Davidson's team.
It surpasses that of any other team in the history of the
school. The only doubt that remains is will the ’Cats be
up to the level of their competition?

SERIOUSLY

Mr. Green’s recent column in the Charlotte News is
the most favorable athletic coverage that Davidsan has
received in recent years. This article illustrated the bene-
ficial publicity that an athletic team can contribute to
the college. Not only does the excellence of an athletic
team place the name of the college before more people,
but such articles as Mr. Green’s publicize those academic
aspects of which Davidson is proud.

A small college like Davidson, if it wishes to recruit
the ablest student body possible, must acquaint a repre-
sentative public with just what makes this kind of col-
lege strong.

Perhaps this is as good a reason as any for inter-col-
legiate athletics.

SQUEEZE

the names of those players elected to the second team
were omitted. To give them their due, the following are

DAVIDSON OVER LEHIGH

Plenty Of

How About The Stew?

BETHLEHEM, PA., Lehigh University, Office of
Public Information — Lehigh football coach Mike Cooley
literally has six hands under center during preseason
drills, as a veteran senior quarterback and two talented

but untried sophomores battle for

a chance to call the

first offensive play of the Engineer's 1963 season.

Senior John DeNoia (Scotch
Plains, N. J.) set a single-game
passing mark of 195 yards two
seasons ago and kept Lehigh
fans on their feet and opponents
wary with the threat of his long
“bombs.” The only quarterback
with significant varsity exper-
jence listed on the 1963 Lehigh
roster, DeNoia is presently be-
ing challenged for the starting
spot by Bob Draucker. (York,
Pa.) and Les Kish, (Phillipsburg,
N. J.) a pair of neophytes whose
combined efforts led Lehigh's
freshmen to a won 4-lost 1 slate
last year.

Draucker passed for a .500
average and three touchdowns

before being sidelined with an
ankle injury after three games
as a freshman, giving Kish a
full-time opportunity to display
outstanding play calling and
run-pass option abilities. Both
sophomores are rated by their
coaches as fine defensive backs
and have already been tabbed
for duty in the Engineer secon-
dary.

“With two weeks of practice
and a scrimmage with Princeton
ahead of us,” he concluded,
“our quarterback post could be
won by any of the three. And
we can't forget junior Mike
Yots (Verona, Pa.) who saw some
varsity action in 1962.”

The soccer horde invaded
Atlanta from the north using
Sherman tactics in devasting
Oglethorpe College and Emory
University late last week. The
team scoring record was pushed
from twénty-eight to forty-one
goals, as Walt Eckman and Fred
Schoen played with the individ-
ual scoring record.

An Oglethorpe squad compos-
ed of retired football players
and wrestlers failed to stop a
swinging Davidson offense to
the tune ofa 9-3 romp. High-
light of the game was the new
Davidson scoring record of ten
goals set by senior Eckman.

A total of six 'Cats hit the
cage threads in Thursday’s rout.
Dan Adams. Bruce Swain and
Lewis Foss booted one
apiece as ‘Eckman, Jan Brakel
and Lee Fanning hustled in two
each.

Besides the help that Ogle-
thorpe offered us, Coach Harry
Fogleman cited the efforts of
Eckman, who was moved from
inside position to center-for
ward. Eckman “directed the
plays" and his scoring helped
make the Oglethorpe effort. one

of his best games yet.

Also ‘responsible for the win
was a trio of sophomores, led
by Fanning, who blasted in two
goals. Hustling Foss hit the
scoring column for his first
goal at Davidson: the two
sophomores showed indications
of maintaining the bright soccer
picture for the 'Cats. Last of the
three is first string fighter Ben
Nzengu, who has done a fine job
of controlling the ball all sea-
son. Fogleman commented that
the Oglethorpe coach considered
Nzengu worth the placing of
two defensive men on him
throughout much of the game.

The Emory game should de-
finitely be labeled as a religious
triumph of the highest order;
Calvin’s forces rolled easily over
the Methodists in a 5-1 rout. At
least twenty-five alumni. along
with a saddened Homecoming
crowd observed the team's best
offensive attack of the season.

Fogleman stated that the only
one who made a mistake all day
was himself. He lamented sub-
stituting a certain short, stout
player to cover one of Emory’s
fastest men. He went on to-say
that “You can't single out one
player and say that he made thé
game for us.”

Powerful Glenn Hanes pulled
together to play the gamy every-
one has been expecting of him.

the season has played every

spirit.

An important outcome of the
game was co-captain Schoen's
three goal offensive play, which

Lehigh Meets. Davidson

In Battle Of The Winless'

BY JIM BEASLEY

With Benny Coxton now permanently at halfback, Davidson is priming its offense
for tomorrow's football game with Lehigh University. The Wildcats also plan to make
extensive use of the shotgun formation which was so effective against Presbyterian

two weeks ago.

This is-the ‘Cats’ first game
with the Engineers since 1960,
when Davidson defeated them
21-18 at Bethlehem, Pa. “We
just don't know much about
them,” says Coach Bill Dole.
“From two scouting reports, we
know they run from a different
offensive set of plays each game,
so we will prepare a standard
defense.” The man to watch
seems to be sophomore quarter:

Wrestling Tourney
Begins Next Week

With flickerbali out of the
way, the IMAC is now in the
process of wrapping up golf. The
lowest three scores from each
fraternity will be considered in
tabulating the standings; the
deadline for turning in scores
has been extended to Sunday
midnight.

According to President Sam-
my Going, the wrestling tourna-
ment will begin next Monday.
Most fraternities have taken
to the mats in preparation and
Ritz cracker diets are not un-
common among the more obese
would-be jocks. The only other
sport scheduled before Thanks-
giving is swimming.

Present plans call for basket-
ball to begin immediately after
Thanksgiving. In contrast to past
years, each team should have
around six games completed by
the Christmas break.

The only other note of present
interest to come out of the IMAC
is the postponement of track
until next spring,

back Lee Kish, whuse running
and passing have accounted for
many of the Engineer's scores
this season.

A Middle Atlantic Conference
team, Lehigh has failed to win
over any of its tough opponents.
They have lost to Delaware,
Cornell, Gettysburg, Rutgers,
Columbia and Colgate. After
Davidson, they complete this
schedule with Bucknell and
Lafayette.

Morris Williams and Lyle Bla-
Jock are doubtful starters for

Davidson. Because of injured
ankles they haven't seen much
practice this week. Tackle Bill
Dole, Jr. has been moved to Wil-
liams’ guard spot and Jim Fuller

Harriers Take Fifth Place
In N.C. State Invitationals

BY DAVID POWELL

Facing a field of highly-subsidized teams at the State
Meet at Raleigh last Tuesday, Davidson’s harriers took a

respectable fifth place.

North Carolina won the meet
and was followed by Duke, NC.
State, and Wake Forest. David-
son succeeded in defeating Pem-
broke, which had previously
lost to the ‘Cats in a dual meet,
High Point. and Atlantic Chris-
tian College.

Tommy Heffner was the first
Davidson man to place, taking
eighteenth. He was followed by
John Barrow (20th), Ronnie
Reese (27th), Andy Little (32nd),
and Denny Phillips (33rd). “The
boys made a good showing,”
commented Coach Heath Whit-
tle, “considering they faced a
field of about seventy-five fine
runners.”

Led by Robert Dean and Bob
Sjogren, the Freshman cross-
country team took an even bet-
ter fourth place, once again
trailing Carolina, Duke, and
Wake Forest. Both Dean and
Sjogren won medals, placing
seventh and ninth respectively.
With this meet the Freshman
ended their season, compiling
a 3-2 won-lost record.

The varsity, however, still has
one dual meet on its schedule,
facing V.P.1. at Blacksburg on
Nov. 12. Should the ’Cats take
this enc, which appears some-
what likely, they will take an
enviable 63 record with them to
the conference meet, also to be
held at V.P.1. on Nov. 18.
