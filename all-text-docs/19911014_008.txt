The

asked students whether
they thought enough
was being done to in- |
clude minority groups |
in the "Davidson ex-

No, I don’t think enough
is being done, but I think
its the students’ responsi-

bility, individual students,
to go ahead and get to

know a lot of people who
are not the same as them
and I think it’s really im-

ee

I think that people need to
be aware that black stu-
dents at Davidson do have
their own culture, their
own lingo, their own
tastes, and when they do
coalesce in groups, that it's
not a result of trying to
segregate themselves, but
justto be together to share
_ these things that they have
in common. But I think
“that the international fes-
tival was a great thing, for
people to give the minori-
ties and the foreign stu-
dents achancetocelebrate
their culture, to celebrate

their way of life.
No, I really don’t

thinkenough is being done.
I think that we should do
more things like the inter-
national festival and things
that stress intercultural
interaction, not just things
like black history month
for blacks to celebrate
themselves, I mean that’s

great, but for everyone to,
-getachancetointeractand ,_.

to mix and to work on
things together; common
projects. No, Ireally don’t
think that enough is being
done. The little diversity »
that does existat Davidson

is not being taken advan- |

tage of.

T'ma freshman, The guys
on my hall are real nice,
we get along. Me and my
roommate Frank, we’re
the only two black guys
on the hall besides our hall
counselor Anthony Foxx.

sponsibility of the school
itself to encourage it, but I
think that it’s a good thing
for them to encourage it
through events like the
international festival.

I think that’s really
good, but I think individu-
als need to take initiative
to gettoknow those around
them.

but as far as racial and
ethnic understanding, it
just comes with interac-
tion.

I don’t know how
much the school can do to
promote that type of inter-
action

George Spain, 95

The problem that I have
with Davidson when
you’re talking about bridg-
ing the gap between dif-
ferent races is the contro-
versy over black students
having their own black
male fraternity.

The white students al-
ways ask “why do you
need your own fraternity?”
White fraternities: just

don’t meet the needs of ’

black students here on
campus. And they also
ask “Well, why do you

Yes, I think enough is being
at the present time to help race ‘

have the BSC?” As the
minority on this campus
we need something where
we can all come together
and be together and really
feel like we do belong
somewhere on this cam- -
pus. I’m not saying that
we always feel like we’re
outcasts inclassrooms, but
sometimes we do feel that
way and after a while you
kind of want to feel com-
fortable around people you
can really relate to.

Cunninghams, now we have the
Bundys. The crew of "90210" has
replaced the Brady Bunch, and the

sit-coms like “Newhart”, ““TheOdd -

Couple”, and “Happy Days” are
no longer on. I will readily admit
that I did fall victim to this media
and television trap, and I simply
want to point out that I think I have
figured out how the system works.
Artists, under the First Amend-
ment, can create anything they
want, but that does not mean you
have to like their creations or en-
dorse them. Next time you are
watching prime time television, ask
yourself what you are laughing at,
and whether it is really funny.
