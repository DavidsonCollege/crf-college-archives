sonal records shall be
kept in confidence by

less chartered by the

°TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY
Yuletide is almost upon us. Let’s stop wasting time in
classes and get on with our Christmas shopping. Follow-
ing are a number of gift suggestions, all easily obtainable

First, a most unusual gift idea, brand new this year
and certain to please everyone on your list—a gift cer-
tificate from the American Veterinary Medicine Associa-
tion! Each certificate is accompanied by this charming

poem:

Merry Christmas, north and south,
Does your cow have hoof and mouth?

And your dog, fidele semper,

Here's acure for his distemper.

Little kitten, cute and squirmy,
Bring her in. 1 think she's wormy.

To bunnies, turtles, parrots green,
Joyeux Noel! Heureuz Vaccine!

Are you wondering what to give that extra-special man
on your list? Stop wondering. Give him that extra-special
shaving combination, Personna Super Stainless Steel
Blades and Burma Shave. Each gift is accompanied by

this charming poem:

Chriatmas merry, New Year bonny,
From your friendly blade Personny.

You will have the ladies fawning,

If you're shaving with Persawning.
Injector style or double edges,

Both are made by good Persedges.

And Burma-Shave in plain or menthol,
Leaves your face as smooth as renthol.
