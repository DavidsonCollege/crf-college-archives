Bleached Canterbury

To The Editor:

A petition to be circulated
this week deals with the
abolition of the Davidson
College Laundry.

Its sponsor, Steve Can-
terbury, has urged the student
body to seek it out and sign it
as part of a crusade against
the social evil inherent in a
college-owned laundry.
‘‘Discrimination and
Illegality”” seems to be the
slogan of the campaign.

The theoretical base tor this
action is well-articulated. Mr.
Canterbury does not like
paying the compulsory laun-
dry fee which must be collec-
ted for the laundry to stay in
business.

He maintains, rightly so,
that he could do his own laun-
dry at a greatly diminished
cost. He clamors for the right
to have an option. His
motivation is selfish-he would
like to save his money.

With these concerns I most
assuredly sympathize.

So the answer to the dilem-
ma is a simple one. Justice
must prevail-the same com-
pulsory laundry fee for
ome or else no laundry at

The first option is im-
practical so the second is all
that is left-and we have a
solution!

There is where the
argument leads, cut and dry
except for one damning con-
sideration. The underlying

Mary Turner

Tale

assumption of this line of | As good democrats should,

reasoning is the belief that a
majority of the student body
would like to save money by
doing their own laundry.

The convenience of the laun-
dry will be thrown to the wind,
and each student will revel in
the prospect of weekly laun-
dry duty.

Suppose though, that a
Davidson student should
prefer someone else washing
his clothes. Simple, says Mr.
Canterbury. Steve is ready to
do it or have some other
student do it for the cost dif-
ference that each student
would save. .

Yet the only way a student
would save is by hiring out his
fellow-students for cheaper
wages than the compulsory
laundry fee now provides for.

Take the college out of the
laundry business, but exploit
your fellow student. This is
the kind of enterprising
capitalism that produced the
likes of Kar] Marx.

Convenience without
unqualified equality, then, is
the basis of the present laun-
dry arrangement. Abolition of
the laundry would produce in-
convenience and a theoretical
equality, plus savings for a
few.

The thrust of my’ argument
is that the majority of students
would prefer the present
arrangement. The petition
drive will demonstrate the
student opinion.

Mr. Canterbury and I both put
our faith in majority rule.

The anti-laundry crusader
obviously has an agreement
with higher-ups that the
majority decision will prevail
if his petition secures enough
signatures.

He feels that the majority of
students will shun the con-
venience of the laundry and
take to the washboards. I
respectfully disagree.

Some of you will recognize the allusions-to Psalm 34, for
example, and to one of Wordsworth's sonnets; and perhaps the
allusion in the closing lines, to Eden. I may need to remind some
of you that the delights of Eden are behind us; we are post-
edenic readers; we are not reading about how we should have
acted, or should act, in Eden. The poem is about our griefs, our

Hearst Abduction Reveals
Bungled Ransom Requests

Patricia Hearst was kid-
napped eight weeks ago. We
have heard many reports in
those 8 weeks and seen a lot of
things that we thought we
never would see.

It appears that crimes have
become increasingly political
over the past decade.

Originally, a plane would be
hijacked for a free ride to
Cuba or a ransom of $100,000.
Hijackings soon became
political weapons. Nations

would do amazing things to in-
sure the safe return of their
hijacked citizens. They would
release other criminals or pay
exorbitant amounts of money.

Kidnapping, one of the
oldest crimes, has been quick
to come to the fore as a
political weapon.

Let us consider briefly what
we have seen with respect to
the Hearst kidnapping since
Patricia Hearst was abducted
on Feb. 4.

Randolph Hearst soon found
that his daughter had been
taken hostage in a political
maneuver. He immediately
offered to do anything for her
return. The Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA),
Paatricia Hearst's abductors,
let him know exactly what
they wanted. Food for the

poor.

As it turned out, they wan-
ted a lot of food for the poor.
The food began to be
distributed and and
his crying, pathetic wife
begged for the return of their
precious daughter.

But the SLA wanted more
food and the freedom of two of
their comrades.

Eight weeks after the ab-
duction, I am disgusted by the
entire affair. I am _ not
disgusted because the SLA
kidnapping Patricia Hearst
and forced her father to give
food to the poor.

1 find that a noble action,
perhaps the only noble action
of the entire affair.

I am disgusted by the
necessity of that act to insure
food for the needy, the in-
credible naivete of the SLA,
the attitude of Patricia’s
parents and the general at-
titude of our society. That’s a
lot to be disgusted with and I
hope to give my reasons
presently.

What if Patricia Hearst’s
death is caused either directly
or indirectly by her abduction.
What if 100 people live who
might have died of starvation.
Either way, we see a tragedy.

- Patricia’s tragic flaw is her
ancestry as is that of all the
poor. Does Patricia Hearst
have any more right to live
than a starving, San Fran-
cisco Mexican? De you have

any more right to live than a
hungry, Davidson Black?

Why do the rich need to keep
getting richer? They can
never spend all their money on
themselves anyway. Why
can't the Kennedy’s start a
free food plan in Boston before
little Teddy, Jr. is kidnapped?

These questions could well
have been asked by the SLA.
Yet the SLA and most other
groups who commit a crime
with a political motive are
terribly naive. It is certainly
good that the poor people of
San Francisco are getting free
food, but sooner or later,
Patricia will either have to be
returned or killed.

And what has their action
accomplished?:They have suc-
ceeded in filling the bellies of

among the ‘great silent
majority’, and most everyone

more harm than good. They
are a group of stupid
revolutionaries (who are not
to be confused with intelligent

the problems of
Southeast Asia. We're too
busy trying to decide what
band to have at our fraternity
this weekend.

We're just too damned busy.
