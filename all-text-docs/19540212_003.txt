FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1954

Despite the slight-
ing remarks of the
Charlotte dailies the
Davidson College Wild-
cats have almost with-
in their grasp a bid to
the Southern Confer-
z ence basketball tour-
nament in Morgan-
z town, W. Va., on the
45-6 of March. At
present the Cats boast
a 3-3 record in the con-
ference side of their
B action with only two
conference encounters
remaining on the slate.
Both of those confer-
ence games are vv be played on enemy courts as the Miller-

men hit The Citadel tomorrow night and Furman on the 26th.

Should the Cats come through with a win over The Cita-
del (who, by the way, beat them in Charleston last year) to-
morrow they will definitely make the long trip over the moun-
tains to the stomping grounds of the Mountaineers come early
March. In that case a loss to Furman would make little dif-
ference as the Cats would finish with a 4-4 record and a spot
in the tourney.

We feel that the Cats and their coach are due a lot of
praise and congratulations for a job well done as they have
come a long, long way from that Guilford opener to hold a
6-10 record to date. They have worked to achieve this position
and have played some good basketball after their slow start.

As the 1954 version of the Davidson Wildcat football
eleven climaxes its second week of spring practice action
with a scrimmage tomorrow afternoon, Coach Bill Dole has
expressed his optimism for the coming season of fall-1954
and is very well pleased with the spirit and hustle of the squad
as they go through their practice paces.

Justly can he be proud now of his freshman additions to
the squad who, with the exception of but one man, weathered
the exam storm which usually takes quite a toll of Davidson
freshman athletes. The freshmen are panning out in varsity
competition just as well if not better than Coach Dole and
his staff could have hoped. In every position the frosh have
either pushed returning regulars to the second team or are
in close pursuit of the veterans for the first string nod.

“We have a bigger squad to work with this year and we
should round out into a much stronger and deeper team by
next fall,” says Coach Dole. The amiable Wildcat head man
also hinted at another good freshman squad in prospect for
next year.

The Cats will hold their second big scrimmage of the
spring session tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, weather per-
mitting, and this will be a good chance for the student body
to get a sneak preview of the 1954 Wildcats in action.

At the quarterback spot Dyke Little and Dick Belton
are giving returning regular Bill Rowland a lot of competition
for the starting assignment, while at fullback Ken Conger
and Eugene Reid are giving plunger Henry Brown a

Davidson’s crippled wrestling team enters the home

month. The Southern Conference meet will be held on the
campus of VMI on March 5 and 6, and mat coach Charlie
Parker says that Davidson College will be well represented.

visitors will make it tough in every
event. Being in the Davidson pool
will help, and the marked improve-
ment of Captain George Crone, Al
Ormond, and Bob Patton in the
past few weeks might be enough
for victory. But as is often the
case, a Davidson win would be an
upset. ‘

Besides the improvement of the
varsity team recently, the fresh-
men have been coming along in a
manner to considerably brighten
next year’s prospects. Tommy
Rivers will have to fill George
Crone’s place in the breast stroke
next year, and he shows great
promise. John Edwards, Bill Car-
rell and Danny Crates are look-
ing better in every event, while
Jim Pressley, Basil Sharp, and
hardworking Frank Kiker complete
a well-rounded team. All these
freshmen should strengthen the re-
turning varsity enough to make
next year a winning one for the
tankmen.

Davidson, N. C.

The varsity is in bad shape for
the coming matches. Bobby Joe
Key, No. 1 man in the 123-Ib class,
is out for the rest of the season.
Charlie Murray, Don Reid, and
Bill Coe have suffered injuries, but
will definitely see action against.
Washington and Lee next Thurs-
day.

Remaining matches for the
Wildcat grapplers include W&L,
and VPI. The Cats met Citadel
here this afternoon.

When the conference tournament
time rolls around, Davidson will
be sending quite a few wrestlers
to the meet. Charlie Murray, Don
Reid, and Charlie Buxton will be
the leading Cat candidates for con-
ference honors, with Murray stand-
ing the best chance of coming out
as a champion. Murray has lost
only one match thus far this sea-
son.

Coach Parker states that Mur-.]_

ray, Reid, Buxton, Coe, and Faison
may all have to drop down one
weight class for the tournament.
Bill Keiter will replace Key in the
varsity line-up, and with a little
experience, Bill could become a
top-notch grappler.

The Davidson freshman team got
its second win of the season last
Saturday when they trounced
Cramerton High School, 28-8. The
frosh record now stands at two
wins against two losses. The one
remaining match on the schedule
is a return bout against Cramerton
here next Thursday. It is to be
a preliminary match to the David-
son-Washington and Lee scrap and
will start at 1:30. p.m. The varsity
match will be under way about

3:30 p. m.

BETAS UNBEATEN -- ATO’s FALL

By JOHN HOLSHOUSER

With only three weeks to go in
the interfraternity basketball race,
the powerful Betas are riding in
the top slot with a six-game win-
ning streak against no defeats.
The ATOs, who were tied with the
Betas for first place, found them-
selves unseated by a strong Pika
defense and ended up tied with
the Pikas and Kappa Sigs for
second place.

The best performance in the
scoring department for the week
and the season was turned in by
the Kappa Sigs who walloped the
Independents by a score of 90-25.

Corky Clark of the Kappa Sigs
hit for 35 and &# points in this
week’s games to pull Kis 19-potnt
average up to 24 for six games.
Corky leads the league in the
highest average and for the most
points scored in one game, 37.

*| Murray Page, leading ATO scorer,

is in second place with a 17.6 aver.
age. Lindley Beardsley of the
Pikas secured the third place po-
sition with an average of 16.3.

Freshman Cagers
Idle Aller Two Wins
In Good Weeks’ Play

By ANDY TURNER

After two impressive wins in the
past week the Davidson Wildkit-
tens of Coach Paul Scott are idle
until next Friday when they make
their last road trip of the season
as they travel to Pfeiffer Junior
College. The Scott-men now boast
an 83 record for their season's
efforts.

The freshmen defeated Pfeiffer
earlier in the season with little
trouble on the local court and
shouldn’t have too much trouble
making a repeat performance. The
only other game remaining on the
schedule is the Gardner-Webb en-
counter in Johnston Gym as a pre
liminary to the North Carolina
State encounter with the varsity on
Feb. 22. The Kittens haven't faced
the Gardner-Webb quintet this sea-
son and some stiff competition is
expected by Coach Scott.

Two Wins

The Wildkittens continued their
winning ways by soundly defeat-
ing in last week's action both the
Kannapolis Y and Charlotte Col.
lege. The victory over Charlotte
College marked the second win for
the Kittens over the Owls this
season. The win over Kannapolis
avenged an earlier loss to the
YMCA team.

The frosh continue to show a
team work system to make up for
their lack of height. Gaylord
Walker, along with Richard Weeks
and David Shaw continue to share
scoring honors.

Thus far this season the Wild-
kittens have taken the measure of
Pfeiffer Junior College, Wingate
Junior College, Charlotte College
(twice), and Kannapolis YMCA.
They have lost to Kannapolis, Win-
gate and the North Carolina frosh.

battled down to the final whistle in
an exciting game, with the Phi
Delts winning 42-35. For the vic-
tors, Jim Ensign hit for 22, while
Don Comer fiipped in 14 for the
Phi Gams. Halftime score, 21-18.

Sigma Chi 61; Pi Kapps 37
The Sigma Chis checked the Pi
Kapps in this weck’s first round
by a 61-37 count. Perrin. Anderson
came through with 19 points to be
high man for the Sigma Chis, while
Swain dumped in 14 for the losers.

KA 61; SPE 42
Sparked by the 22 points of
Pete Bridges, the KAs rolled to a
61-42 victory over the eighth place
SPEs. Charlie Butler had 16 points
for the SPEs.

Kappa Sig 90; independents 25

The Kappa Sig powerhouse broke
the intramural team scoring record
in crushing the injured Inde-
pendents, 90-25. Corky Clark
pushed through 37 points to lead
all scorers, and Dye connected for
18 for the Independents.

Pika 76; SAE 29

In a great attempt to keep up
with the high scoring Kappa Sigs,
the Pikas rolled up 76 points to
defeat the SAEs 76-29. John Hand-
ley poured in 34 points for the
winners, and Dyke Little led the
SAE attack with 12 points.

tourney has been scheduled

By BUDDY LILES

Coach Danny Miller’s Wildcats will journey to Charleston
this weekend for two big purposes. The first is to add two
more victories to their record, while the second and more im-
portant is obtaining a spot in the Southern Conference tourna-
ment which a win over The Citadel would cinch.

After defeating VMI last Satur-

day, a win over The Citadel will
put the Wildcats in a good posi-
tion with the Furman game the
only other conference game re-
maining.

On Friday night the Cats will
tangle with the College of Char-
leston and remain over in Charles-
ton to encounter the Bulldogs of
Citadel. The Cats have beaten both
of these teams in earlier games,
but both squads have improved
greatly since the first encounter.
The Cats opened after the exams
with the College of Charleston and
won easily by a wide margin. The
same procedure could be in order.

Bulldogs Improved

Against the Citadel, Coach
Miller related, that is a different
story. Several years ago the Wild-
cats swamped the Bulldogs by a
score of 106 to 60, and then
traveled to Charleston only to
come out on the short end of a
revengeful battle by about ten
points. The Bulldogs will be play-
ing for this kind of revenge.

The hopes of the Cats will rest
mainly on sophomore sharpie Hob-
by Cobb. Hobby {s the leading
scorer with about a 16-point. aver-
age and is usually exceptionally
good against Palmetto foes. A
leading rebounder, Cobb will team
with Graeme Keith, center, who
has moved back into the pivot slot
replacing Big George Melton who
hasn’t been finding the range
lately. Keith holds the second
highest scoring average and pro-
vides the needed height for re-
bound work.

Same Team

Rounding out the starting five
are Ish Bennett, Buddy Brown, and
Ray Harding. To keep their op-
ponents from concentrating on the
top scorers, either of these boys
can take up the slack. Brown, like
Cobb, is a good rebounder and
possesses a dead eye. Bennett goes
like the Wildcats as a team—some-
times hot and sometimes cold. Ray
Harding has won the starting guard
assignment in the past few games
but both Dick Adams and Pappy
Fowle will definitely see action
this weekend.

If the Cats can take both or
either of the games easily, Coach
Miller plans to use his reserves
freely, thinking of next year. The
main boy who will have to step

Aiken. Al is six feet four and has
played in several of the games this
season but needs experience to
take Keith’s or Melton’s place.
Another sophmore who has shown
improvement since the beginning
of the season is Curtis Cates who
may see action at the guard spot.

THINCLADS WORK
HARD AS INDOOR
SLATE APPROACHES

The Davidson thinclads have
settled down to hard work during
the past two weeks after the ten-
day lay off for exams in prepara-
tion for the coming indoor season.
The team will participate in the
Southern Conference meet on Feb-
ruary 19 at VMI and the ACC In-
vitational meet (in the non-confer-
ence class) at Chapel Hill on Feb-
ruary 27.

Shipley Hitting Stride

Bill Shipley, who placed third
in the 440 at the old conference
indoor meet last year, will be one
of the top contenders this year in
that event. Shipley is beginning
to show top form in practice now
and should be ready for the in-
door affair.

Coach Whittle also has high
hopes for the mile relay team. Bill
Shipley, Phil Koonce, Dick Lov-
ette, and Frank Mitchener com-
pose the team. Koonce and Mitch-
ener will also run in the 60-yd.
dash event. Koonce wili enter the
broad jump for the team’s only
field event competition.

Homer Sparks, who finished
sixth in the two-mile at the Con-
ference outdoor meet last spring
and second in the conference cross
country meet last fall, along with
Andy Turner will go the
strenuous two miles in this meet.

Dick Lovette is scheduled to
run the 880-yard run in the con-
ference meet and he and Archie
Joyner will run this event in the
ACC meet. Pete Ashcraft is de-
veloping into top form for his en-
trance into the freshman mile in
the Southern Conference meet and
the % mile run in the ACC meet

and should be one of the top con-

—es | into big shoes is sophomore Al tenders in that event.
