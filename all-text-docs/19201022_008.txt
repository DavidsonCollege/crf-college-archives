‘THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 22, 1920.

DAVIDSON’S SMASHING»
ATTACK

(Continued from page 1)

The third quarter started out with
what looked like a Baptist rally,
when Fulton recovered a fumble and
ran 55 years for their only touch-
down. The Wake Forest men seem-
ed to take on new life after this and
for several minutes put up what
might be called first class football,
but they soon weakened under the
mighty offensive and defensive work
of Davidson, and the question from
then on was how much the score

would he.

After the lone touchdown — of
Wake Forest, Davidson received
and worked it up the field only to be
held for downs. McFadden punted
and Rabenhorst was downed in his
tracks. The aerial offensive of the
Gold and Black ended disastrously
for them when Shepard intercepted
an attempted forward pass and
raced over the goal line for the
third touchdown of the game, it be-
ing also his third one.

The fourth quarter was also
Davidson’s quarter and Moore ad-
ded to the score. another touchdown
when he slid across the goal line
with three Wake Forest men hang-
ing on to him.

The outstanding star for the
Wildcats was N. W. Shepard, who
scored three out of the four touch-
downs made by Davidson. — This
fleet-footed boy ran through Wake
Forest’s line and around ends at will
and his work in this game stamped
him as one of the real stars of the
Davidson team.

Moore, another new man on the
team this year, ran the team with
fine generalship, and carried the ball
more than one time for gains of
over ten vards. He won his way in-
to the hearts of the Red and Black
by the way in which he handled the
team and his ability to come out
from under a pile of men unscratch-
ed.

Captain Hammett played true to
form which his admirers predicted |
and was in every play, breaking
through the line at will and break-:
ing up many of his opponents plays. |
This bie tackle broke through the-
line and blocked a punt of Raben-
horst’s which was recovered by a
D. C. man.

Poe, Cassell, McFadden, and
Schenck did stellar work being in
every play. Cassell started the,
game like a whirlwind, but was put
out when he got tangled up with an
opponent who was not very gentle.
His shoes were ably filled by Poe
who. distinguished himself by [his
line bucking. McFadden did all of
the kicking for the Wildcats and
not one of his punts was blocked.

Rough tactics featured the game
at certain times but on the whole
it was a good hard-fought game.

Faison, who replaced Douglas at
end did some nice work on the de-
fense while he was in the game,
blocking a punt, and breaking up
end runs. He was injured and had
to be taken out of the game.

Rabenhorst and Heckman did the
best work for Wake Forest. Raben-
horst’s punting and Heckman’s de-
fensive work were especially worthy
of mention. ° |

Wake Forest made only two first
downs during the whole game, one:
of them being on a forward pass.

Between halves the Davidson
rooters snake danced around the
field to the music of the Band. After
the game a large number went
winding up Tryon Street and the
traffic on the Square was held up
for a short time.
