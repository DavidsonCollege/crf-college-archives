SHAKESPEAREAN PAGEANT
PRESENTED MONDAY

On last Monday afternoon the artis-
tic talent of Queens and Davidson Col-
lege was combined in the presenting of a
Shakespearean pageant, on the back cam-
pus of Queens College. All of the char-
acters were portrayed well, and it would
be a hard task.to name the best. Altho
the affair was somewhat handicapped by
the lack of costumes, still it proved a
great success, much of the praise for
which is due the excellent management.
Thru the kindness of the Statesville
Female College, several costumes were
obtained for the more important char-
acters. There was a large and attentive
audience present and every one seemed
pleased with the entertainment.

SCRURS WIN FROM
CHARLOTTE HIGHS

The Charlotte Highs lost to David-
son Scrubs Saturday, the score being 10
to 8. There was some good playing by
both teams at times, tho the game was
crowded with many errors and long
drives. Davidson was at no time in
danger.

Especially noticeable was the work of
the Pharr brothers, Pharr, of Charlotte,
catching well, and Pharr, of Davidson,
playing an crrorless game at third.

The batteries were: Shaw, Monteith
and Faires for Davidson, and Murray
and Pharr for Charlotte.

MINISTERIAL BAND
ADOPTS NEW FEATURE

duced into the meetings of the Minis-

great reformers may be taken up separ-
ately and given careful study.

game with a Texas leaguer to left, scor-
ing Brown. Davidson’s final run came

plate.

SECOND FURMAN GAME.

The second game was an old-fashion-

ed swatfest, both teams hitting the ball
to all corners of the field, the final score
being 14 to 11 in favor of Davidson.
The game was exciting all the way thru
and furnished many thrills to the large
crowd present. Currie, who started the
game for Davidson, was hit hard and
gave way to Lawson in the fourth, who
held his opponents fairly well. Furmar
was forced to use four pitchers, none of
whom. were able to stop the onslaught
of the Red and Black sluggers.
_ The features of the game were two
circuit drives by Captain Alford and the
heavy hitting of the whole Davidson
team. Brown, McMillan, Saunders and
Younger each got two or more hits.

GUILFORD GAME.

In a fast and well played game David-
son continued its winning streak by de-
feating Guilford Monday in Greensboro
6 to 5. Hengeveld did the twirling for
the Red and Black, and allowed only
nine scattered hits. His team-mates
gave him excellent support, both in the
field and at bat. Finch started in the
box for Guilford, but was derricked
in the sixth inning, after eleven hits had
been secured off his delivery. Zachary
succeeded him and prevented further
scoring.

Johnson, Alford, Wood and Black
were the leaders in the stickwork for
Davidson, two hits being garnered by
each. Black also furnished the fielding
feature of the game, when he speared a
hard hit grounder in the sixth with one
hand and retired the runner. Reddick,
the Quaker shortstop, was the fielding
star for his team, while Zachary led the
hitting.
