THE DAVIDSONIAN

Olestra: it’s all that and a bag of cl

guess I’ ll have to begin this week’s

article with another apology. I’ll

admit it, a grave error has been
made.

You see, I have failed to provide a
disclaimer for my readers, and for that
reason alone I have become terribly

misunderstood. Some people, it has °

been discovered, are incapable of han-
dling my sarcasm, and it is this intoler-
ance that leads to horrible accounts of
misguided slander and cruel verbosity
(see the “Britton Taylor Sux” issue of
The Davidsonian, pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8,9, 10, and 11).

To prevent such instances from
occurring in the future, I have no choice
but to institute the Britton Taylor Opin-
ions Column System of serious ratings
(code-named “BuTtOCkS”) — acalcu-
lated and precise mechanism which I
myself have devised for the benefit of
my readers.

And so I now have no choice but to
tell you that this here column is rated
“H”. What the hell does that mean, you
ask? It means this article is Humorous.

If you do not have a sense of hu-
mor, you are not allowed to continue.
Do not pass go, do not collect $200, do
not waste your time writing a lame
article in response.

That out of the way, I would like to
assume the role of consumer advocate
for the remainder of this column. Imag-
ine Ralph Nader, only a tad shorter and
a lot fatter.

Now, I normally wouldn’t con-
sider myself to be one too concerned
with his psychical health. Perhaps you
have seen me running down Concord
Road with a cigarette in my mouth. Of
course, I have asthma, too, but I swear
I’m the fastest damn asthmatic smoker
you ever saw — a jiggling, jogging,
wheezing contradiction!

I’m not one to count calories, ei-
ther. I’d much rather count the number
of hairs on my chest (I’m up to three
now) or the number of beers I can shot-
gun without blacking out (27).

Concern with fat grams is equally
absurd. As I’ve said before, you can’t
have “FRAT” without “FAT.” And we
all know that a world without FRAT is
a world without New Balance™ shoes
— what a terrible thought!

Nor would I consider myself a
label reader, unless I intend to humor
myself by reading out loud all the
funkadelic chemicals I'll be ingesting.

But the other day; an awful thing
occurred to me. I was sitting in the
library reading when a friend of mine
approached me with this large bag of
barbecue chips. All she could say to me
was, “Man, these chips are good. Man,
these chips are good. Man, these chips
are good.”

Well, I’m never one to turn down
a good chip, so I tried one and then

another, and then another and another
and another, and before long I polished
off the whole bag. No big deal, I do
stuff like that all the time.

But then this girl goes on to tell me
that these chips are actually some sort
of newfangled scientific experiment and
that the entire bag of chips actually has
negative calories. Once inside the stom-
ach, the chips apparently change into
barbecue chewing gum, a substance
which, as we all know, stays inside your
bowels for anytime upwards of 14 years,
taking thousands if not millions of calo-
ries to digest. :

I’m immediately looking at the
label for a buzzword, something that
catches my eye. At the bottom of the
packing in bold print I find the follow-
ing warning:

Caution: This product contains
OLESTRA, a’ substitute which may
cause abdominal cramps and/or loose-
ness of the stool. Do not drive after
eating olestra. Do not operate heavy
machinery while consuming olestra. Do
not go swimming for 30 minutes after
you have eaten olestra. Do not eat this
whole bag by yourself. If dizziness,
nausea, sore throat, headache, vomit-
ing, diarrhea, or paralysis occurs, please
consult your physician immediately.
Questions??? Please call our toll-free
consumer hotline at 1-800-HELP-ME.

- Now, remember that I’m reading
this after I have eaten the entire bag of
genetically cloned chips. My immedi-

ate reaction is one of great horror. I
swoon in my chair, grasping my stom-
ach in pain. I thought I might become
the first male to experience what it feels
like to give birth.

And all the while this girl keeps
saying — “Man, those were some good
chips, huh?!” Unbelievable.

Fora while I actually thought about
calling the hotline in order to inquire
about my well being, but what were
they going to do, send me some free
chips? That certainly wouldn’t remedy
my current situation.

All I could do then was wait, but
for what, exactly, I wasn’t really sure.
Should I make out a will? Or perhaps I
should call my parents so I could tell
them that I was about to be killed by a
bag of potato chips? I even thought
about running down Concord Road with
acigarette — one last victory lap for the
inhaler-burdened emphysemiac. I de-
cided against this only at the last minute,
for I came to realize that I had failed to
consider the olestra caution’s stool
clause seriously. Jogging “loose”
quickly became an abominable and dis-
gusting impossibility.

I then considered a few eulogies
for my gravestone, such as the follow-
ing:

Here Lies Britton Taylor,

A Jolly And Pleasant Fellow.

In The Year Nineteen Hundred
And Ninety-Eight,

He Sucked And Ate A Bad Potato.
Not bad, I guess, but then I got to
thinking that I had to do something

about this terrible situation. I had to
warn the rest of the world about
OLESTRA before we are succumbed
to this deadly fat substitute.

Unfortunately, I got sidetracked
because I started getting stressed out
about all the work I had to do that night.
I did have a midterm and a test the
following day. I was going to have to
abandon my plan to save the world.

I went to bed that night expecting
it to be my last. The stomach cramps
had begun, and I figured the paralysis
would set in sometime during the early
hours of the morning.

I must admit, I was a bit surprised
when I woke up the following day, still
alive. Ever since, the left side of my
body has been completely numb, but
other than that I think I made it through
okay.

I guess my concern here really lies
with what we are eating out there. At
what point must we stand up and admit
that we won’t risk getting a stroke just
to enjoy a few low-fat potato chips? At ,
what point must we all, as concerned
eaters of nasty things, put our fists into
the air and chant as one collective body
the following prayer: “We will not eat
that which will most certainly kill us!”

I yearn for that very day. When it
happens, be sure to let me know, be-
cause I want to be in the front row so
The. Davidsonian can take my picture.

Until then, I°ll be in the library
signing autographed copies of my new
book, entitled “Olestra: The Next Nutra-
Sweet™, Only It’s a Lot, Lot Worse.”

Is this the

must be getting old. But more and
I more I long for the “good old days”

at Davidson. After the disappoint-
ment two weeks ago of realizing that
Davidson is planning to institute ra-
cially and religiously segregated halls,
I was crushed to find a sign posted in the
Union signifying another major change

at Davidson: the apparent end of the
administration’s faith in our Honor
Code.

At the request of the administra-
tion, the Union no longer allows stu-
dents to use a friend’s card to buy food.
On the memo ex-
plaining — this

death of our honor?

cards, etc. even if they claim to have
permission to do so? Society does not
trust its members to be honest enough to
tell the truth in such matters. If your
father said that your mother had given
you permission to take five dollars from
her purse. to buy her a bottle of milk,
would you have any problem taking
that five dollars for milk? NO. Why?
Because you totally trust your father
and have no doubts that, if he said your
mother gave you permission to take the
money, you have permission to take the
money.

So if the administration felt the
Honor Code was working as it should
and that Davidson students could. be
trusted, would they initiate a policy like
this one? NO. Explicit or not, what is
the motivation behind such a policy?
Students cannot be trusted to tell the
truth. The Honor Code doesn’t. work

reasons I chose this college. Following
the embarrassment of the “Gist Trial,” I
was very worried about the future of
one ‘of Davidson’s greatest treasures.
The Davidsonian poll (whether repre-
sentative or not) showed that a large
number of students had lost faith in our
system. Following the Gist Trial, I was
assured by administrators that changes
were being made to the Honor Code and
trial procedures that hopefully would
restore faith in the process. That is why
I was so saddened by this new policy.
The Honor Code is definitely not at its
strongest point right now. We need the
administration to lead by example and
take an active role in strengthening the
system. This policy does the complete
opposite and shows that at least certain
parts of the administration have lost
faith in our Code and our Honor.

I don’t think the Honor Code is ©

dead. I have faith
in Davidson’s stu-

change, student

dered to confis-
cate any person’s

“If someone says he/she has permission tousea fnend’s s
card, that should be the end of it.”

dent body and in
Davidson’s tradi-
tion. Just the other
day I saw some-
one “reserve a

tempts to break
this rule. The card will then be turned
over to the Dean of Students, who can
begin disciplinary procedures.

Let’s look at the implications of
this change in policy by answering a
few questions. Why has Davidson al-
lowed students to use each other’s cards
inthe past? It has trusted that Davidson
students would use another person’s
card only if they had permission to do
so. Why does society not allow people
to use each other’s credit cards, bank

because students cannot be trusted.

There simply is no other way to
interpret this policy. If students could
be trusted and the Honor Code was
working, there would be no reason
whatsoever for this policy, which is
nothing but an inconvenience. If some-
one says he/she has permission to use a
friend’s card, that should be the end of
it.

The strength and respect of the
Honor Code at Davidson was one of the

table” atthe Com-
mons by leaving her wallet on it before
gettinginline. Students may have been
upset and disappointed by what they
saw at the Gist Trial, but Ido not believe
they have lost their honor. I challenge
the administration to re-examine their
new policy and its implications. Every
part of the Davidson family must be-
lieve in the Honor Code if it is to sur-
vive. I don’t think the students have
given up onthe Honor Code yet. I hope
the administration won’t, either.

| ast night, during another in a
long line of “leadership” semi
nars, I, with 25 or so other

freshmen and sophomores, was to learn

about one of the most important and
unique facets of human life — com-
munication. One of the many activi-
ties the facilitator instructed the group
to do during the
two-hour session
caused me to re-
call a time now

“light years-

ago” — my

Davidson Col-

lege orientation.
The facilitator told each of us to

get apartner, to get “toe-to-toe” across
from them, to look directly into the
other person’s eyes, to not look away
for any reason, and to pick a topic and
discuss this until he told us to stop.
Now, I don’t know if you keep track of
how often you look into another
person’s eyes for an extended period
of time, but last night I reasserted to
myself that I find it disconcerting much
of the time. While I consider myself

eyes.

No, I do not cover them for most
of the day, but I do not hold or keep eye
contact for long, whether in saying
hello orin aconversation witha friend.
Others can analyze why?this is, but I
have my own explanation, one that
came to me as orientation drew to a
close last fall, and one I still come back
to now.

“Over the past week I have met

Lookat

they reveal
themselves, their vulnerability, what
they think of you and of the people and
ideas around them. This information
about people’s relationships between

precious that one can reveal. College
freshmen, businessmen, politicians,
anyone, everyone can only hide so
much. Individuals who think behind
brambles, and fog, and obscure vision
pose the greatest challenge for those
who seek an answer to the most inti-
mate question — what constitutes a
person’s soul — without asking, but
rather through sight and perception.
