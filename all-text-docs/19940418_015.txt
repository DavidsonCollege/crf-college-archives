Rugby roughs up competition, takes division

By Wyatt Lilly

Last weekend the. Davidson
rugby team took their game on the
"road as they travelled to the North
Carolina Rugby Union state tour-
nament. The event, hosted by East
Carolina; featured twelve teams
and was held in Greenville, NC.
The Wildcat outlook was bleak at
the beginning of the weekend, with
many starters out with injuries or
prior commitments. Only twelve
healthy players could make the
trip—three shy of the fifteen nec-
essary to field a side. Team veter-
ans, however, stepped up to pro-
vide leadership for the talented,
but comparatively inexperienced
Wildcat squad. With the help of
some reserves at the tournament,
the team surprised everyone by
finishing undefeated, winning their

division outright.
Davidson began its race to the
title Saturday morning against St.
‘Andrews. This team, a longtime
state power, was at its usual
strength. Shortly into the game,
junior Simon Priestly shocked ev-

to give Davidson the early lead.
The Cats would not look back as
freshman Thayer Long scored one
try while junior Jeremy Potter
scored two hard-fought tries.
Priestly connected on only one of
the conversions, but also made a
penalty kick to aid Davidson in its
26-7 victory.

_The afternoon game against
Western Carolina would prove to
be a confidence builder for the
squad as it completely outclassed
the Catamounts. Senior Mike
Harrell faked out the entire sta-
dium on his way to the try zone.
Not to be outdone, Priestly, sopho-
more Dolph Lunger and freshman
Frank “Red” Killian each provided
a score, with Priestly getting two
tries, one penalty kick and four
conversions to again lead all scor-
ers. Davidson rolled on, 36-10.

Sunday morning the Wildcats
faced a big, tough Wake Forest
team. The two teams always hit
hard and have been involved in
some bitter matches in recent
memory. Davidson took the initia-
tive early on, showing superb play

inthe backfield. The Wildcat backs

were so effective it seemed the ~

Wake defense hadn’t even shown
up. Davidson cruised to a 17-0
halftime lead, behind a try by
Priestly and one by senior Charlie
Morris, deep in the try zone. Priestly
also made good on both conver-
sions anda penalty kick. The teams
traded momentum in the second
half as Davidson found itself go-
ing uphill against the sun and wind.
The beleaguered Wildcats would
not score again while the Demon
Deacons found the try zone three

- times. The Wake kicker failed to

convert any point after attempts,
giving Davidson the state title.

Along with the state champi-
onship, Davidson players won two
individual awards. Priestly was the
leading scorer with 44 points. His
closest competitor could only mus-
ter 28. Also, coach Mike Kirk was
honored as coach of the year.

“Of course it’s a great honor,
but it’s really the team that made it
all possible. I‘owe them all the
credit fora hell of a tournament,”
said Coach Kirk.

These guys have simply dominated

the Cowboys have won the cham-
pionships. It was very unlikely
that anybody would have been able
to knock Dallas off its throne this
year either. At least, until this
salary cap-free agency factor came
into play.

Nearly every day itseems like
another Cowboy is leaving the team
for more money elsewhere. Good
for him, you say. Good for the
sport, the title will be up for grabs.
But, folks, this could be the down-
fall of a dynasty. This could have
been the type of team that gets
thrown in with the Green Bays of
the 1960s and the Pittsburgh
Steelers of the 1970s. And we
could have said we saw them play.

Don’t get me wrong here. I
am not.a Cowboys fan crying be-
cause they won’t be as good any-
more. I hate the Cowboys. - But a
team of their caliber would have
been great for the game. Wouldn’t
it be fun to watch a team that good
play for years and years?

What has been left out so far is
the Art Monks of the league. When
a guy puts every thing he has on the
line for a team for 14 years, that
team should be able to pay him
what he deserves in his final year.
But with the salary cap, teamscan’t
simply sign the best players any
more.

They have to find the best
players at the best prices.

We probably won’t see toc
many guys playing nearly their
entire career with one team again.
Those days are in the past. The
NEL has started down a path with
no obvious end. And along that
path, the league has changed for
the worse. And it won’t be able to
change back.
