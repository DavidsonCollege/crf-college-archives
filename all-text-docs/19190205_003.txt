Phi's Elect’ Marshalls.

A very interesting program was.car-
ried ont in’ the Phi Society Saturday
night. ‘Vhe subject for debate .. was;
“Resolved, ‘Vhat the Allies Should Ac-
tively Intervene in Russia.”
_ Long, Brown and Wool vigorously
upheld the affirmative side of the ques-
tion by showing: first, that international
law permits intervention; second, duty
demands intervention; third, it is neces-
sary from a military standpoint; fourth,
it would be an insurance of peace, justice
and right; and fifth, it would help es-
tablish democracy.

The negative, supported by Spence,
Keith and Freemiin, replied by saving:
‘first, nothing would be accomplished ;
second, history shows that Russia should
be left alone; and third, there is no need
for intervention. ‘Phe committee de-
cided unanimously in favor of the afirm-
ative.

H. A. Hill gave a very humorous
declamation on “The Feast of the Mon-
keys,” which added quite a bit to the
amusement of the regular program.

Following this J. H. McKeithan de-
livered a declamation on “Behind Time.”
‘TY. C. Stone gave an oration, on “Di-
vorce,” in which he brought forward
some deep. logic on the subject. J. K.
Foster gave a declamation on ‘The
Irish Question.” An extemporaneous
debate. followed on the important sub-
ject, “Resolved, That the broom is more
efficient than the vacuum cleaner.” Rob-
erts and Booker debated (?) the ques-
tion, the former being declared the win-
ner.

D. P. McGeachy and J. L. Parks

_Were initiated into the society.

The following marshalls were elected:
O. P. Hart. TY. C. Stone, D. W. Rob-
erts and L. B. McKeithen.

Successful Mecting of Fus.

The third meeting of the Eumenean
Society was highly successful. The pro-
gram was rendered with life and en-
thusiasm, and humor was not lacking.
Two new members were initiated —W.
W. Moore and A. R. Craig, while the
names of A. L. Wilson and H. B.
Brown were passed on for membership.
On account of the lack of time, the
usual initiation ceremonies were  dis-
pensed with.

The debate was opened by J. C. Mc-
Caskill, who gave an excellent presenta-
tion of the question under discussion. He
defined active intervention as the giving
of military, political, and economic aid

a aus __ _ i

to Russia, ML R.*Doubles was the first
speaker on the negative. He referred
to Noah Webster as authority for mak-
ing “Intervene actively” refer only to in-
vasion or intervention by force, military
force. “Che next speaker for the aftirm-
ative was C. E. Cunningham. Cornel-
son, of the negative, then spoke of the
question in a general way, W. R. Booth
next spoke of the economic aspects of the

+| question, bringing out some good points

for the afirmative. Philipps got in some
humor in his speech, and was vigorously
applauded. G. ML. Rebson closed the
debate for the affirmative with a splen-
did exposition of the necessity for crush-
ing Bolshevism, Ormond made the last
speech for the negative. He brought out
the points that the Russians had a gov-
ernment, the Bulsheviki, that interven-
tion would be. contrary to the principles
of the Allied nations, and, that it would
be too great an undertaking. “he re-
buttall were full of pep. Both the house
and the judges decided in. favor of the
aflirmative. |

Bitzer gave a declamation, taken from
Wilson's flag-day address. MeIadden
gave Lincoln's second inaugural address.
It was moved that C.. Bo Robson be
piven credit for his oration, owing to the
limited time. ‘This motion was passed.
Discussion concerning, the marshalls’
regalia was put off until the riext meet-
ing.
