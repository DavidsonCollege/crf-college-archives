SOUGHT BY BUSINESS FIRMS

‘*What Business Looks for in Young Men Today”? or briefly
**Ilow Do I Rate’’ was the subject of the well-delivered talk by
Mr. A. II. Jones in chapel Tuesday. Mr. Jones is well qualified
t» speak on such a subject as he is very directly connected with

Eumanean Society

The Eumanean Literary Society
held its bi-weekly meeting at Eu
Hall on Monday night of this week.
President J. W. Campbell called

dresses starting Sunday night

the business world in his position as Assistant Vice-President of

the American Trust Company of
Charlotte.

As a prelude to his talk, Mr.
Jones, declared the high regard his
company holds for any Davidson
graduates and especially for ‘our
own Mr, Jackson:” In his smiling
manner the speaker went so far as
to say the “halo effect of Davidson
men” must not be allowed to blind
the business man when he directly
evaluates a graduate’s abilities.

Proceeding with his talk, Mr.
Jones briefly outlined eight quali-
ties of personality and character
which most business men require
of a prospective employee.

Number one on his list was plac.
ed Honesty. This quality of per-
sonal honesty and integrity was as-
sumed as basic. Next came friend-
liness — the ability to be courteous
and sincere with all men. Reljability
or dependability fit in third place!
In number four place came Indi-
viduality of thought — no para.
sitism in thinking, Mr. Jones: placed
the ability to work as one of a team
in fifth place. The importance of
off-the-job-living was numbered
six, For’ number seven, the desire
to seek and work things out for
yourself was given emphasis. As his
last point, Mr. Jones: stressed the
need of a sense or feeling of the
principles which built our country
and the real belief in the survival
of America’s free enterprise sys-
tem. In closing Mr. Jones express-
ed his belief in the capitalistic ideals
of our country as the best for the
best in business.

ILR.C. Town Meeting

To Reveal Plans

Tuesday, March 14, the Interna-
tional Relations Club will conduct
a “Town Meeting of the Air” pro-
gram initiating its plans for the
remainder of the semester of bring-
ing not only to its members, but
to the whole student body and
faculty some important, current,
controversal topics. On Tuesday
the impending topic, “The Pros
and Cons of a Labor Government”
will be attacked by Professors
Johnson and Pinkney on the “con”
side, being opposed by Professor
Wilson and Monsignor R. L. Smith

‘on the “pro” side. The I.R.C. is
pleased to have Monsignor Smith
of Carlisle, England, visiting Pro-
fessor Wilson, to speak on our pro-
gram, The two became fast friends
in Europe after the war when
Professor Wilson was in charge of
Protestant services and Monsignor
Smith Roman Catholic services.

The program will be held upstairs
in Phi Hall and all who are inter:

ested in this highly debatable topic

are cordially invited to attend.

the meeting to order after which
a brief devotional was given by
Ken Goodpasture.

Two papers for membership con.
sideration were then submitted by
Dave Mayland of the Freshinan
class and Pete Milner of the Junior
class. Dave’s paper was a satiric
essay on the lethargy of the David-
son students whiche showed a pro-
found insight into the campus sit-
uation while Pete’s paper, “An Ode
to Optics,” was on the lighter side
and proved to be very entertaining,
using our eyes and eye-glasses as
a nucleus of its thought. Both of
these boys were readily extended
bids of membership to the society.

After the roll call and minutes
of the last meeting, Jim W. Camp-
bell gave an address to all the new
members on the ideals, purposes,
and traditions of the society and
welcomed them on behalf of the
officers and old members.

Students Carry On
‘Y' Extension Work

On Sunday mornings when many
of our industrious Student Bedy
are still enjoying their dreams,
there is a group of students, inter-
ested in extra-curricular service,
who make their way through Mecx..
lenburg at its quitest to teach
Sunday school. About twenty arrive
at the county sanatorium and at the
Bethel Presbyterian Church to
teach men and women. Young peo-
ple as well, white and colored. They
find their reward for the sacrifcie
of sleep and the time required fos

their service.

Hutchison Talks To
Photographers Club

Mr. J. S. Hutchison, director of
the Mint Museum in Charlotte and
instructor of fine arts at Davidson,
recently presented a special pro-
gram at a regular meeting of the
Photo Club.

Using a special exhibit of phote-
graphs prepared by the Museum of
Modern Art of New York, Mr.
Hutchison considered the functions
of photography and the photogra-
pher.

“The faculty for inner-commum-
cation, man to man, has put manu
above-the animals,” said Mr, Hut-
chison. “One of the earliest forms
of this communication was: the pic-
ture, upon which our alphaheis
have been built.”

“And one of the newest: fore

TOUR NEGRO
PRITCHETT

Dr. Carl Pritchett led the young
people of his church on a tour of
local Negro housing last Sunday
afternoon, Composed of both boys
and girls, a few parents, and college
sociology students the group visited
every Negro community in the
township, In° this way, Dr. Prit-
chett was able to show both good
and bad housing, forming a basis
for comparing the two. The trp
was climaxed by a detailed inspec.
tion of those homes in the rear of
the business district.

Meets At Goldiers

At the home of the Goldieres on
February 28, at 8:15 p. m. Le Cercle
Irancais held its regular monthly
meeting. The soiree was dedicated
to Dr. Watts who recently received
the “Legion d’'Houneur” from th
Irench government as a_recom-
pense for his stisnulation of French
culture in America. Also H. W. Barr
read a paper on Houwore de Balzae,

Continuing with a discussion of
the types of pictures which can be
created with a camera, Mr. Hutchi.
son concluded with a discussion of
composition forms and some help-

marking the one hundred and fif-
ticth year of his death.

The feature of the evening was
centered around a descriptive trip
to France. Seven members reported
on various regions of France, giv-
ing a bit of their history and show-
ing the highlights of their develop-
ment, The following rook part in
the discussion: W. A. Goodman,
E. C, Parker, W. L. Lord, F. W.
Best, R. R. Hart, K. W. Jones,
and J. R. Keever,

After the program Mrs. Goldiere
and Mrs. Watts served rafraechesse-
ments non-alcolisees and Le Cercle
sang favorite French songs. Pro.

ly with the Chinese children around
their mission. All said that the na-
tive children had been among their
good friends,

When asked if they considered
it a disadvantage to grow up as a
missionary’s son in foreign coun-
try, the general concensus of opin-
ion seemed to be to the contrary,
Though they didn’t have drugstores
or movies around, and they couldn't
buy just anything they wanted, they
didn’t know anything better, so
they were satisfied. All felt that
their schooling had been adequate.
Although the conditions in the three
areas were slightly different, all
expressed essentially the same
ideas.

The last question asked them
was whether there is a tendency for

Dr. Foreman’s home is Fort Ed-
ward, New York. He entered Da-
vidson College as a member of the
class of 19H. |

While at Davidson Dr. Foreman
proved to be a conscientious stu.
dent. He assumed responsibilities
in scholastic and extra-curricular
fields. He was a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and ODK, a national
wonorary leadership fraternity. Al-
so he was accepted into the Phi
Delta Theta social fraternity and
elected editor-in-chief of the David.
son magazine.

After graduating from Davidson,
Dr. Foreman studied at Princeton

ers through his pictures. When the University where he received his
camera is used in this way, its A. M.
product, the photograph, is more P

degree. He went on to
tinceton Seminary where he re-
ceived his S.T.B. and S.T.M, de-
grees, and finally to Yale where
he received a Ph.D. Later Dr. Fore.
man was honored with a D.D. de-
gree by Yale University,

Returning to Davidson, Dr.
Foreman accepted a position on the
faculty as a professor of Bible and
philosophy. Fle has been well re.
membered ‘by seniors who were fa-
miliar with his. able teaching abili-
tics and some of his unusual ex-
periences while working with the
Railway Mail Service. He was also
held in esteem of the mertibers of
the faculty, as was. expressed in
the loss they felt at his acceptance
‘of his present position with Louis-
ville Seminary.

Dr. Foreman's ability to avrite
as editor of the magaziue possibly
encouraged lint to write. many
newspaper columns and, phamplets
at a later date. He has written”
senior pupils .and teacher's quar-
terlies for the Presbyterian Church,
(U.S A.):. sundry articles in the
Union Theological Seminary Re-
view, the Presbyterian Outlook, the
Earnest Worlser and the Presby.
terian of the Sowth; and = many
tracts such as, “On the Enjoymeni
of God.” Perhaps his’ most impor-
tant literary achievement is his
weekly International Uniform Sun-
day Schoo! Lesson. This column is
printed by sixteen-hundred weekly
newspapers an behalf of forty
protestant denominations,

In view of Dr. Foreman’s writ-
ing ability it is natural that -he
