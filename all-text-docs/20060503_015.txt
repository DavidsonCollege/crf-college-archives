By PIERCE TRUMBO

Field Hockey:

2004 Record: 6-12 1-5-NorPac

2005 Record: 5-12, 2-4 NorPac

After an exciting season-opening 3-2
(2OT) win vs. Rider, the field hockey team
lost seven straight games and never seemed
to recover. Highlights included a 3-2 (OT)
win vs. Georgetown and back-to-back wins
vs. Appalachian State and Longwood.

Women’s Soccer:

2004 Record: 12-9-1,
SoCon Tourney Runner-up

2005 Record: 14-5-2, 9-0-1 SoCon,

At one point, the women had a 16 game
undefeated streak before losing in the SoCon
semifinals to Western Carolina. Kara Koehrn
"06 was terrific all year, scoring 19 goals.

7-3-1 SoCon,

Men’s Soccer:

2004 Record: 11-10-1,
Tourney Runner-up

2005 Record: 14-6-1, 5-1 SoCon, SoCon
Tourney Runner-up

The men’s soccer team dominated this
year, and came just a game short of a SoCon
Championship.The team will have to
rebound next year after losing seniors Matt
Allen, Jeff Davis, Preston Davis, Nahum
Navas, John Latting, Jordan Hauser and Will
Carroll. :

4-3-0, SoCon

Men’s Cross Country:

2004 Results: Sixth at
Championships

2005 Results: Sixth at SoCon

While the men duplicated their 2004 fin-

ish this year, the ’Cats showed promise.
Jonathan Baker ’06 and Austin Mercadante
06 held to form, and newcomer Lance
Harden ’09 was earned SoCon Freshman
Runner of the Year honors.

SoCon

Women’s Cross Country:

2004 Results: Third at SoCon Meet

2005 Results: SoCon Champions

Brenna Burns ’08 led the Wildcats to a
Championship season as the team beat
Chattanooga to win their second SoCon
Championship in the last three years. The

team will lose key runner Allie Martin ’06

but a strong set of sophomores—Burns,
Annie O’Donnell, Megal Atias and
Stephanie Scott—should put’ them right
where they need to be to repeat next year.

Football:

2004 Record: 2-7, 1-2 Pioneer League

2005 Record: 4-6, 1-2 Pioneer League

The team started 3-3, lost 3 straight games,
and then won at Georgetown 10-3 to end the
season on a high note. Look. for continued
improvement next year as Ryan Alexander
"08 and Ryan Hubbard ’08 are a legitimate
QB-receiver combination.

Volleyball:

2004 Record: 10-23, 7-9 SoCon

2005 Record:15-18, 11-7 SoCon

Volleyball endured a tough non-confer-
ence schedule and managed to have a win-
ning record in the SoCon. Look for contin-
ued progress next year. °

Men’s Swimming and Diving:

2004-05 Record: 3-7, 2-3 CAA, 8th at
CAA Championships

2005-06 Record: 4-7, 2-3 CAA, 6th at
CAA Championships

The men’s team improved upon its per-
formance from a year ago. Highlights includ-
ed a 3-3 finish after starting the season 0-4.

Women’s Swimming and Diving:

2004-05 Record: 4-8, 2-3 CAA, 6th at
CAA Championships

2005-06 Record: 3-9,
CAA Championships

The women’s team struggled but did score
big victories vs. Wingate (177-53) and
Drexel (245-102).

1-4 CAA, 9th at

Men’s Basketball:

2004-05 Record: 23-9, 16-0 SoCon

2005-06 Record: 20-11, 11-5 SoCon,
SoCon Championships

The most popular sport on campus didn’t
dissapoint. Led by a strong class of seniors—
Jan Johnson, Brendan Winters, Kenny Grant,
Jason Morton, Matt McKillop, Chris Clunie,
and Eric Blancett—the team avenged last
year’s SoCon semifinals’ loss by winning the
SoCon Tourney in convincing fashion. The

league's cellar.

Sucks

Exams: It's the saddest week of the year. There's no sense in complaining, but we'll do
it anyway so our lives have more meaning.

Shaq in Chicago: The Big Fellow had his problems in the Windy City, and now the
Bulls have evened the series 2-2. Forget a championshi;, the Heat need to worry about
getting out of the first round. Somewhere Kobe is laughing.

Stephen A. Smith: He gets his attention by being loud, obnoxious, and dogmatic.
Smith is to the sporting world what James Carville or Ann Coulter is to the political
world, meaning that he's entertaining but essentially a biased and idiotic loudmouth.

Sports Fan Dogma: One reader had a problem with Alex Arinsmier's '06 claim that
fandom of a team requires residence near the site of said team. We thank Alex for his arti-
cle, but in retrospect, the claim (at least for some) seems a little bold and exclusive.

Breaking up with your beloved Co-Sports Editor:

To Monica: We had such good times, baby. The emails, the fonts, the NASCAR
columns, the writers not writing articles, the late nights at the Union. Baby, it was all
truly magical, and I know I would never never do it again...Pierce

To Pierce: I love you. And now that we’re finally done with this rag, I actual-
ly mean it. I’ll look past the fact that you hate baseball and NASCAR and love you for
who you are--a basketball-obsessed freak...Monica

Doesn't Suck

Class of 2006: We'll miss them all. Especially the athletes.

Men's Track Team: The guys finished third at the SoCon meet with 84 points. It was
their best finish ever, topping the sixth place finish and 43 points they earned in 1978.
Congrats to coach Gary Andrews who garned SoCon Coach of the Year honors.

Emily King: The freshman from Honolulu garnered SoCon Freshman Runner of the
Year honors after her blistering 38:04.10 in the 10K at the SoCon Championships. Her
time was good enough for both a school record and the SoCon Championship.

Kobe Byrant: Turns out that Kobe is laughing down here. With two buzzer-beaters,
No. 8 was simply incredible in Game 4 against the Suns. Phil Jackson meanwhile sits by
calmly, unsurprised, as if he has seen this type of heroics before. Which, of course, he

L.A. Clippers: The Clippers had been in the above category for about 30 years until
they had a respectable season and demolished the Nuggets in the first round. Kudos to
Sam Cassell, Elton Brand, and coach Mike Dunleavy for lifting the Clips out of the

team then almost upset OSU.

Women’s Basketball:

2004-05 Record: 18-11, 14-6 SoCon

2005-06 Record: 17-12, 12-6 SoCon

After losing Katie Hamilton ’07 to a torn
ACL and starting the season 1-5 start, it
looked as if the "Cats might be in for a rough
year. But the team responded and finished
the season 16-7. Jessica Mitchell ’07, Tia
Washington ’07 and Brynn Kelly ’07 were
impressive all year. And freshmen Mercedes
Robinson and Kelly Gassie also looked
promising. With Hamilton back next year,
the 2006-07 women’s basketball team could
be what the 2005-06 men’s basketball team
was this year.

Wrestling:

2004-05 Record: 8-7, 0-5 SoCon

2005-06 Record: 7-9-, 1-3-1 SoCon

Under coach Bob Panetsky, the wrestling
program has turned it around in recent years.
This year, the team earned its first SoCon
win in 21 years by beating App. State 23-17.

Women’s Tennis:

2004-05: 20-6, 8-2, SoCon Tourney
Runner-up

2005-06:18-9,
Runner-up

Despite losing the Fillnows, the women
again proved strong. If it weren’t for
Furman, the team would have two SoCon
Championships in the last two years. The
"Cats should be poised to improve next year
as they are only losing one senior.

8-1, SoCon Tourney

Men’s Tennis:

2004-05: 11-14, 4-6 SoCon

2005-06: 10-12, 2-7 SoCon

A mediocre season for the men. The team

does, however, say goodbye to long-time
Coach Jeff Frank, who won over 530 eames
in his 34 year career.

Baseball:

2004-05: 26-24, 13-17 SoCon

2005-06: Currently 17-27, 5-16 SoCon

So far the baseball team has struggled,
particularly during a stretch when the team
lost 15 of 17 games. Jay Heafner 06 and
Alex Entrekin ’06 are two bright spots.

Lacrosse:

2004-05 Record: 4-12, 0-6 ALC

2005-06 Record: 9-7

The Lacrosse team was one of the most
improved teams as the 'Cats won five more
games than they did last year.

Men’s Track and Field:

2004-05: 8th at SoCon Championships

2005-06: 3rd at SoCon Championships

If Lacrosse was one of Davidson’s most
improved teams, the men’s track and field
team was the most improved team. The men
scored an impressive 84 points at the
Conferenece meet for their best finish ever.

Women’s Track and Field:

2004-05: 11th at SoCon Championships

2005-06: 8th at SoCon Championships

The women’s team also had a solid year,
improving upon their 11th place finish at the
SoCon last year. Look for Emily King ’09
and Caroline Sanker ’09 to continue helping
the team improve.

Golf:

2004-05:3rd at SoCon

2005-06:5th at SoCon

The golf team fell off a little this year as
_they placed 5th at the SoCon tourney.
