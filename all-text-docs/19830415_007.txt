Downtown Merchants Propose New Mall

By FRANCES HAMPTON

Davidson downtown merchants and
property owners met on Monday for re-
view and suggestions of a first-draft pro-
posal of the town’s pedestrian mall now
in the planning stages.

Mayor Nancy H. MacCormac, whe
chaired the meeting in the Piedmont
Bank conference room, expressed en-
thusiasm for a project destined to trans-
form the downtown business district of
Davidson. One person at the meeting
termed the mall the most exciting thing to
happen in Davidson in 25 years.

The audience listened intently as Bill
Nicholls of Dellinger and Lee Architects
explained the initial plans.

Nicholls, town leaders, and mer-
chants have met frequently in an effort to
assemble a workable set of plans condu-
cive to the needs of those involved.

The pedestrian mall development be-
hind the Main Street stores is contingent
upon several factors, including funding
from both public and private sources.

On the drawing board for phase one is
a new post office building th at will likely
be ready for occupancy in early 1984.
The complex of shops and stores will
eventually stretch from the Town Hall to
Depot Street, with some sort of central
courtyard as a focal point. This too
would likely be a part of Phase I and fu-
ture development would then follow as
more people became interested in the
project.

Nicholls envisions landscaping with
light posts and benches, brick walkways,
and the possibility of grouping utility
items such as transformers, electric met-
ers, and garbage dumpsters for conveni-
ence and serviceability.

Parking for customers is of major

concern, with a projected need of five
spaces for each 1,000 square feet of

shopping space. The Town of Davidson
currently has only one parking space for
each 1,000 square feet.

Maps on display in Piedmont’s Con-
ference Room were removed after the
Monday meeting and taken to the Town
Hall for further discussion at Tuesday
night’s Town Board Meeting.

Evangelist Minister Visits Campus

By DAVID RESNIK

“My purpose is to introduce people to
the closest friend I have, Jesus Christ,”
said Cliff Knechtle 76 concerning his
reason for visiting Davidson is week.

Davidson Christian Fellowship spon-
sored Knechtle’s four outdoor
evangelism meetings on campus. this
week. He spoke at the quad area created
by Belk and Richardson Dormitories, the
laundry and the Commons on Wednes-
day afternoon, and between Phi and Eu
Halls on Thursday morning. Knechtle
will also speak in the quad this afternoon
and at DCF’s open group meeting tonight
at 7:00 p.m. in the Morrison Room.

As a specialist working for Inter-Var-
sity Christian Fellowship, Knechtle has
held meetings on college campuses
across the country for the last several
years.

Using examples from the Bible and
everyday life, Knechtle said he stressed
five major issues during his talks: “What

Cliff Knechtle spoke

is the meaning of life? Why is there
reason to live? Is there an ultimate moral-

ity? Is there life after deatn? Who is the

real Jesus Christ?”

More than one hundred people at-
tended his speech on Wednesday after-
noon. Knechtle said that the Davidson
audience responded well, but audience
reactions have ranged from “strong op-
position, to receiving Jesus Christ,” he
said.

Knechtle visited UNCC and Emory
earlier this week and Duke and N.C.

State the week before. His next stop is
Purdue. He travels with his wife Sharon.

Knechtle says he didn’t always be-
lieve in God; he had a conversion experi-
ence as a child. One day he walked down
the stairs in loneliness and asked Jesus,
“If you are the truth, I want to know.”
After that time he said he no longer
walked alone.

After majoring in history at David-
son, Knechtle attended the Gordon-
Cornwell School of Divinity in Boston
where he earned his Master of Divinity.
