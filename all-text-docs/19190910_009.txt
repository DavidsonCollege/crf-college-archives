WHAT?

THE DAVIDSONIAN, OF COURSE

If you should ask what makes it so large, so attractive and
so everlastin3 important, we could not give you all the
reasons in this small space, but ‘‘there’s a reason.” Kind-
ly study the advertisements in this issue, and the people
that are responsible for them.

We do not ask that you refrain from buying from a person
because his name is not in the Davidsonian- -probably he
is trying to get in now---but we do insist that you trade
with our advertisers. Remember that they make the Da-

STOCKED YET.

Owing to unsettled conditions last
year, the commissary was not run, but
we are back to normal conditions now
and the athletic association will run its
commissary as in fermer years, MLit-
thews and Wilson, ‘T. H., have been ap-
peinted managers,

They will carry in stock all athletic
_gcods, gym. suits, felt goods, college

“helts, tennis shoes, etc., etc.

The students are reminded that the
above goods are sold only by the com:
missary, according to a ruling of the

‘athletic association some years ago. Stu-|
dents will not be allowed to peddle|
‘these goods from roum to ‘room. |

A complete stock of goods has been)
| ordered but owing to congested express
‘ conditions it has not all arrived yet, but
the managers are expecting to have ai
, complete line within a few days. ‘

And again we return to Davidson
an® find it the same peaceful, congenial
i place. Our very beautiful campus is al-
j ways admired by everyone that visits:
Davidson as well as by ourselves daily '
‘ because of its large shady trees and the
i birds that inhabit their boughs, but espe-
cially are the spacious lawns admired
while here, and longed for when we are
away. Now that we have a school of
some 425, it has been seen fit that we
use, or evidently our tennis courts are
required for additional campus lawns or
grass plots for the herbivorous animals
of the community. Whether or not

’ either of these assumptions are correct it

iis a sad fact that the grass is covering
the upper six courts and that the lower
ix are not only covered with grass but
‘have the ditches and bayonet dummies
still therecn. From this chaotic scene
'we turn our eyes northward and look
at the beautifully “dish-shaped” pair of
courts at the east of Chambers. Quite
true it is that we have the best possible
backstops for these two and also it is
true that in years past they were flat or
approximately -so—but the rains of the
past years have by the pracess of erosion
washed in the banks on either side until
the alleys are on an incline of some 25
degrees at places. Is it not possible that
our tennis facilities be raised from this
pitiful state? Is there any reason why
‘52 men cannot have the tennis privileges
in the proper way, instead of eight, on
the two ‘dish-shaped courts, the other 46

being denied? Shall we still go on with- .

out facilities as the man who builds a
beautiful home of the finest woods but
gives it no protection from the weather,
‘and lets it fall into decay and ruin?

EPLURIBUS UNUM.
