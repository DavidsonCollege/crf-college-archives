NUMBER EIGHT

IFC Brings Oscar Brown,
For Concert Next Week

Oscar Brown, Jr., “a fresh, unassuming young man with a crew cut who projects |

songs with searing vigor,” has been engage

week.

“Wearing a blue shirt and a
striped tie with his sleeves roll-
ed up,” continues New York
Times critic John S. Wilson, “he
went to work with an easy pre-
cision and a strong sense of
production values, dominating
the stage as much as Harry
Belafonte (whom the singer is
said to resemble) does.”

Johnny Rogers, IFC presi-
dent, assured THE DAVID-
SONIAN this afternoon that
Brown definitely will be here.
The advance check has been
mailed in and the final con-
tract is now in his hands.

Brown hit the national spot-
light in 1961. Previously un-
known beyond his native South-
side Chicago, he was suddenly
rocking audiences and moving
veterans of show biz to praises.

For so brief a career, Brown
has an impressive list of con-
certs and night club acts, in-
cluding Carnegie Hall in New
York. ‘“‘My lyrics are verses
about feelings I’ve felt and
scenes I’ve dug,” he has ex-
plained. “The melodies I made
from tunes, rhythms, chants,
calls and ‘cries that have always
sung to me.”

Brown will come midway in
the festivities on Nov. 16

Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.
the Wildcats face the Rich-
mond Spiders at the David-
son stadium. Following will
be Brown's concert. Later in
the evening, several fraterni-
ties are having Fall Func-
tions.

Further evidence of his pro-
found success comes from Dave

Brecht Drama ‘Galileo’

BY JIMMY DOWNEY

Next Vagabonds Play

Davidsonian Assistant News Editor

The Vagabonds will present Bertolt Brecht’s drama Galileo on Nov. 14-17 at 8:15
p.m. at Hodson Hall in the Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

The historical play, with a
cast of .about..30, relates the
story of the famous Renaissance
scientist and his struggle against
authority in his day.

Brecht, one of the most im-
portant German playwrights,
write this play during the per-
iod 1937-39, probably in Scan-
danavia. Later during the Nazi
period in Germany, Brecht es-
ecaped to the free world.

The premier of Galileo was in
1943 in Zurich. The English ver-
sion was the work of Brecht and
Charles Laughton in 1947 in

translating and making consid-
erable changes in it. Then the
play was taken to New York
and has been performed fairly
often since then.

Because of the recent increase
in interest in Brecht’s works in
the U.S., the Vagabonds, in con-
nection with this play, will pre-
sent on Nov. 17 a Workshop
Production Of Poor B.B. This
performance, in Hodson Hall at
8:15, is a study of Brecht, who
died in 1956, and his works.
Various selections of his prose
and poetry will be discussed.

The poster display was but
a minor part of a long-stand-
ing objection to the Queens
drinking rule. In effect, the
rule states that no Queens
student shall drink while un-
der the college jurisdiction
from September to May. Ex-
ceptions include students on
holidays and at home.

The most recent infraction of
the rule resulted in six girls
being campused for toasting the

The Homecoming edition of
THE DAVIDSONIAN carried an
editorial admonishing the
Queens girls to express their

Queens Resident Student

the DAVIDSONIAN _ editorial:
first, suspension is not the mini-

of the rule, and, second, the

evening for the Visitors. Also
honored at the banquet were
the new officers of the board.
Names were unavailable at this
writing.

This evening the Visitors are
attending one of three special
seminars to be held during
their meeting. The basic idea of
the seminars is to acquaint the
Visitors with the new methods
and approaches that Davidson
is using in teaching drama,
science, religion, philosophy,
and the humanities to relate
these isolated subjects to a lib-
eral education

Following the seminar this
evening, a reception will be held

Local Graveyard Boasts
Historic Boxed Remains

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Everyone knows where “the graveyard” is, and most everyone has probably
seen the historical marker to Lt. General D. H. Hill outside. But there is more! Like
practically every site in Davidson town, the cemetery is filled (literally) with histori-
cal significance and information related to the college.

The cemetery was set apart
in the summer of 1838—omin-
ously soon after the’ college it-
self began operation. Since that
time it has received everyone
from College presidents to a
Bavarian workman, Mathias
Engle, killed in the quarrying
of rock for college building and
buried, presumably out of gra-
titude, by the “people of Dav-

|idson College.”

Perhaps many of its student

and faculty guests would have

return of bones to proverbial
dust, more or less dictated their
final resting place.

The literary societies used
to be even more active than

most people realize. In fact, .

until the 1880's, whenever a
fellow member died, the so-
ciety with which he was af-
filiated arranged his funeral,
which was held in the society
hall. He was provided with
tombstone, replete with the
hallowed society seal.

The depleted organization then
invited its opposite to join in
the mourning, which consisted

of a crepe arm band worn for

a month and total suppression

of frivolity, obviously observed
for a somewhat shorter period.

As an example of the socie-
ties’ in memoriam activities, the
Eumeneans provided for the
burial of Aghabey David Yonan,

for years a local legend due to
his vain attempt at saving a
drowning fellow student, an act
which cost him his own life.

jOf course there’s always
D. H. Hill, who brought to
Davidson with his teaching

ability a strong code of stud-
| ent behavior which the facul-
ty promptly accepted for our

school. This no doubt early
endeared Hill to the students;
in fact, there was rumor that
he was hit by a rock during a
student riot.

He later left Davidson to
teach at the North Carolina
Military Institute, which was

A visit to the cemetery, with

his college rely on the mouldy

a century and a quarter. It is
