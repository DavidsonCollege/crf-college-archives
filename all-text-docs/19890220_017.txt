Team handball preview: you run, you jump, you throw

By LARRY SLEDGE

Spring-time is coming and the advent of
a new phenomenon is upon us. Intramural
Team Handball comes to Davidson.

That’s right! You've seen it in the Olym-
pics, now play it here.

Team Handball is an exciting fast-paced
game which combines the skills of running,
jumping, and throwing. The sport is rela-
tively new, dating back to the turn of the
century. During that short time it has be-
come the world’s second most popular
sport, behind only soccer, The United
States has constantly been drubbed in the
Olympic Team Handball competition, ever
since its inclusion in the games in 1972, But
according to the U.S. Team Handball Fed-
eration, the growing popularity of the sport
in the U.S. will soon change that.

The sport has been compared to a num-
ber of other team sports. It resembles bas-
ketball, water polo, ice hockey, and indoor

soccer. Many facets of each of the sports

are incorporated in Team Handball. But the
best way tounderstand the game is to watch
it being played.

The first game of Team Handball at :

Davidson will be an exhibition. Appala-

chian State University has played the sport
at the intramural level for ten years. IMAC
has made an agreement for a home-and-
away series with the Appalachian State
Team handball all-states. Davidson’s team
will include aspiring Olympic handballer
Mike Friedlander, lacrosse great Dave
Becker, equipment manager Dangerous
Dan Morphis, and many other top stars.

. The team will be coached by Vic Gatto,

who has hinted that he may suit up and try
to make a comeback (he was a prep-school
team handball sensation). The game will
take place immediately after a team hand-
ball clinic, put on by the Appalachian State
team. The festivities begin at 6:30 on
Thursday , February 23 in Johnston Gym.

Be there, and catch the action!
