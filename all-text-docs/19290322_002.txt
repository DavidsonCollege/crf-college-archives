JUNIOR ISSUE

Several years ago the Junior
Class abolished Junior Speaking
as held during the Easter Holi-
days. At the same time, Sanity
Rare, a humorous publication was
also abolished. In the place of
Sanity Rare, an issue of the Da-
vidsonian is put out during Junior
Speaking, this issue being called
the Junior Issue and featuring ac-
tivities of the Junior Class. The
issue is handled by the Junior
Class, and a staff is appointed to
act in charge of the publication.

The statf for this year’s issue
has worked hard to put out a
good number of the paper. The
editorial staff has gathered to-
gether the necessary feature
stories, and the business staff has
labored to get the advertisements,
in order to raise the necessary
funds to put out a special issue.
The paper is no larger than usual,
but there are many features, and
some unusual cuts of
views.

Acting in charge of this issue
is C. M. Pratt, chairman, work-
ing with him, on the editorial side,
are E. D. Miller, V. A. Milton, and
R. F. Jarratt; on the business
side, W. B. McGuire, E. H. Mc-
Call, and L. A. Mills.

THE CHANGING VIEW

Everything changes, the world
goes on, and the old gives way to
the new, old ideas are superceded
by modern thought. Such a
change has come over’ Junior
Speaking. When Junior Speak-
ing was first thought of the

“country was ringing- with the en-
thusiasm of oratory, so the first
“speaking” stressed the import-
ance of oratory. And even then
the junior oratoricals were only
a preliminary to is commence-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

March 22, 1929

- R. D. Powell

R. D. Powell, of the freshman
class, is seriously ill as this issue
goes to press, being confined in
a hospital in Atlanta. Powell
came to Davidson last fall. He
had his prep school training at
the Darlington School, in Rome,
Ga. Before his illness, Powell
was a faithful worker on The
Davidsonian, and was well liked
in his class. The Davidsonian
wishes him a speedy recovery,
and extends to his parents its
sympathy, while he is ill.

ry

ment orations. Now the time has
come when the oratoricals are no
longer of any importance. Social
activities have taken their place.
So much that the speaking is no
longer included in the week-end,
this year they are postponed /in-
til after the festivities are oven,

This view only reflects the
changing ideas of the world at
large. For many years the trends
and thoughts of the people have
been changing and being directed
toward a different channel. Peo-
ple are losing their interest in
oratory and learnedness, the so-
cial life is stressed. More people
would turn out for a tea than
would gather together to hear
the two best speakers in the
world, The tendency of the world-
changes, so why should not the
tendency of a group‘also change.

Junior Speaking has changed,
very few pay any attention to the
speaking part, even the thoughts
of the Juniors change. Since
there is a lessening interest in
the oratory, and this part is only
perfunctory, why not abolish this
part entirely? There are several
reasons in favor of this, the chief
one being that there is a neg-
ligible amount of time and atten-
tion given to it. It is a struggle
for the class to get enough men
to have a speaking, very few at-
tend. Other established institu-
tions have given way to the mod-
ernistic trend, other sacrifices
have been made upon the altar of
progress. Why keep the archaic
speaking when its usefulness has
passed, and the only reason for
continuing it is the thought of

rsentiment and deference to the
established.

EXPENSES

We believe that those in charge
of the program for this year’s
Junior Speaking are to be com-
mended heartily for having ad-
hered to the determination ex-
pressed by the juniogs of last year
to abolish the old idea of the
proper way to conduct the week
which bore their name,

It used to be thought the thing
for each rising senior class to
drain its members of all the
money that could be begged, bor-
rowed, or stolen. And this for a
supposedly fine time. :

The present plan, when looked
at before it is put into actual ex-
ecution, seems to have the mak-
ings of a thoroughly good time—
the program of events is full at
all events,

Whether or not, the week will
be expensive to the class—not as
individuals, but in the form of as-
sessments we do not know. At
least we have been told by the
authorities that it will not.

And lastly, it is a good thing to
omit the former gatherings in the
gym, suffocated with confetti, hot
air, and typical banquet food, But
this idea may not be permanent,
and we may weaken like the Sen-
iors, after saying we will have
nothing more to do with Alumni
gymnasium until we are alumni.

ARE WE DOING OUR PART?

It is both natural and expected
that old people are prone to make
the statement, at one time or an-
other, that the younger genera-
tion is inferior to the young set
of their own day as far as morals
are concerned. Due to this fact,
whenever we hear such a state-
ment we tolerate it with a smile,
and realize that we must not take
these opinions too seriously.

Such has come to be the atti-
tude towards the spirit in most
schools. The students expect the
“Old Grad” to mourn over the de-
crease of that old fighting spirit,
and consequently, do not take it
to heart. Often, however, ad-

herence to such criticism might
well be taken seriously. Is it pos-
sible that such might be the case
in our own Davidson, surrounded
on all sides by tradition, and em-
bedded in a rock-like foundation
of the never-die spirit?

There are numbers of small in-
stitutions in the country that see
athletic service of some type
from every physically fit man in
the student body. If there is a
real spirit, this is it.

Let us look at our own case for
an instant. Somewhere in the
neighborhood of forty men from
a student body of over six hun-
dred have turned out for track
practice. There would be some ex-
cuse, perhaps, if all the varsity
men were stars and had their
positions cinched; but on a team
where there are possibilities to
do something for the school, the
coaches, and sfor yourself, is it
right not to at least try?

We should not question the tra-
ditional spirit of our Alma Mater,
but ourselves, to see if we are do-
ing our part to insure the main-
tenance of such a spirit. It de-
pends on those who constitute the
vital part of the.institution; and
that part is surely the students.

History Of Junior Speaking

yy

When a newspaper reporter like me
is assigned an article to write, the fellow
who wants the article has to tell him
where to get the dope. Well, I was told
to go to Doc Charley for all facts, to the
Davidsonian files for all fiction. Well
since Doc Charley has had to clean up the
gym and other places after the Juniors
got through with it he has a pretty
straight story of what went on during
the Junior Speaking exercises for the
past quarter century.

On the other hand we find from the
Davidsonian that each successive speaking
Was unprecedented by any that went be-
fore. Those fellows who wrote these
articles sure believed in the ascending
scale. As long as the Davidsonian is
published and the Junior Speaking is not
attended the climax will not come—ac-
cording to the trend of things as pictured
in the Dayidsonian, But we err just a
little. We forgot to mention that two
speakings did not surpass the former ones
but “proved to be enjoyable occasions.”
But it looks as if the second of those two
may have been pretty good but the fellow
who published the paper thought it would
be easier to copy the head that was used
in the paper the year before than to make
his particular speaking an “unprecedented
occasion.”

But the fellow who told me to write this
article forgot to tell me to go the most
reliable source of information on the cam-
pus. He didn’t think of Cop Johnson,
the night watchman. I remember that
last year (I’m not boasting—just stating
facts) prophesied that Cop Johnson would
throw light on some interesting subjects
during Junior Speaking. And I believe
I was right, too, But since the fellow
who told me to write this story didn't
tell me to see Cop Johnson, I suppose
I can’t do it.

~After having given you a detailed ac-
count of my source of dope I will now
proceed to tell you about Junior Speaking.
Back in the eighties every Senior who
graduated had to make an oration before
he was given his diploma. Well some-
body got the idea in their head that that

wasn’t enough orations. So they stepped
down a class and said that all the Juniors
as well as the Seniors had to make a
speech before they could leave (now-a-
days you have to pay all your debts before
you can get a diploma).

Therein lies the seed of Junior Speak-
ing as we have it today. But you see
the seed has sprouted, matured and gone
back to seed. The first Junior Speaking
was held on February, 22, just twelve
days after the anniversary of Lincoln’s
birthday, or to be exact, on Washington's
birthday. The year of its origin was
1893.

In those days the event was easily the
outstanding date on the social calendar.
The faculty helped in the entertainment
of the many young ladies invited up for
the occasion, just as was done during the
past Senior week-end. Livery stables in
Charlotte were called on to meet the
heavy demand for horses and buggies.
The dome of old Chambers vied with the
Chinaberry tree for social popularity.

The date for the exercises has been
moved back and forth ever since its es-
tablishment. From the 22nd of February
it was changed to occur during the spring
holidays and was later shifted back to the
first part of March. In 1927 it was held
during the spring recess but was shifted
to another date on the ensuing year.

For a long period of years there seemed
to be no change, worthy of publication,
made in the custom. This continued up
until a year or two after the war.

A typical program was as follows:

Thursday, 7:30 p. m, Speaking.

Friday, 3:00 p. m., Speaking.

Saturday (holiday), 10:00.a. m. Speak-
ing.

Saturday, 3:30 p. m.,, Speaking.

Saturday, 4:30 p. m., Faculty Reception.

Saturday 7:00 p. m., Glee Club Con-
cert.

Saturday, 9:00 p.m, F raternity Recep-
tion. ;

The orations given then were the chief
interest of the event. From the entire
Junior Class six men were chosen who
would speak at the following commence-

ment. But the day when speaking was

the main feature was to pass. The class
got too large to require every member
to make a speech before graduation and
he compulsory clause was eliminated. The
literary societies began to select their besty
speakers and designate them to speak in
the contest. During 1920 and ’21 showed
a decline in the number of speakers and
the climax of the whole institution came
in 1923.

There had been a gradual increase in
the attention given the social side and
decrease of interest in the forensic. The
typical program given above was changed
so that it lasted from Thursday night to
Monday night, featured by baseball games,
football engagement, a cabaret in the
gym, two picture shows, and frat teas.
With all these list of activities, only one
period was given over to the speaking in
contrast to five and six in former years.

In 1923 the Junior Class published the
first humorous magazine, and gave copies
of it to all students and visitors. “This
publication was called “Caps and Bells,”
and was followed in subsequent years by
“Sanity Rare.” With the Junior Speak-
ing of 1923 the classes began spending a
large amount of money for entertainment,
taxing the members heavily.

Matters remained in this condition for
three or four years, with each class spend-
ing more money in elaborately decorating
the gymnasium and providing entertain-
ment.

A second or anti-climax came in 1927
when a long open forum article from a
disgusted Junior said to cut out Junior
Speaking. As a result of this article a
vote was made in which the class decided
by a large majority to retain the event.
That year marked the ebb tide of orator-
ical contestants—three men spoke.

The following class, in 1928, modified
the form of the occasion very much, cut-
ting out the humorous magazine and is-
suing a special edition of the Davidsonian
in its stead. Much improvement was
made in the oratory over that of the pre-
ceding year.

Chapter 36 will be added to this story

during the coming week-end.

you were further above; better for the common herd.
