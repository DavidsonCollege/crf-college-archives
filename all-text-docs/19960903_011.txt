HOP, SKIP,

Students, eager to see the band
Jump Little Children, began show-
ing up on Richardson Field at 8
o'clock and were then presented
with a full hour to kill. A miscom-
munication between advertise-
ments, the band, and the Union
Board lead to this dreadfully long
wait that was finally resolved with
a Starting time of 9 p.m.

After cutting a deal for more
staff t-shirts in exchange for a red
table cloth found on the premises
of Johnston Gym, Matt Bivins, the
miscellaneous musician, made a
startling entrance on the shoulders
of his fellow band members as
Super Matt. Having captured the
crowd’s reluctant attention, the
show was off to a start with their
tune, “Dark and Lonely Man.”

With over 900 students in at-
tendance throughout the night, the
show was undoubtedly a success
for the College Union. While many
students left before the final songs,
the crowd at the end remained to-
tally devoted to the stage and mu-
sical presence of the band. The
band’s demands for the students to
dance were never denied; the crowd
and the band could be felt and seen

moving up and down with total
enthusiasm.

Student opinions about the
show varied. Senior, Morgan
Todd, proclaimed, “Those boys are
sassy!” A Union tech assistant
remarked that they performed with
the aura of high school students.

Junior Sanders Hearne said
that the harmonica was not as good
as he expected. Sophomore Brad-
ley Oliver questioried whether the
band had reached the realm of the
much-acclaimed sounds of Phish.

One agreement amongst re-
viewers was the abrupt close of the
show. Student and band-members
alike were relishing in the musical
and physical energy. When the face
of the sound director was seen at
the edge of the stage distracting the
bassist mid-way through a song,
the revelry was cut short. Appar-
ently, the College Police were de-
termined to enforce the sound cur-
few. A mild encore of “Johnny
Jump-Up” ended the show on a
less than energetic note.

Before this disappointing fin-
ish, the band played their classic
finish, “Opium,” one of the few
pieces that has less of a top-40 feel.
Grabbing the crowd’s attention
with the clear line, “do you smoke
opium, he said,” the crowd was
hurtled into dancing heaven as

Jump, Little Children
Evan, the drummer, expanded the
varied rhythms of the song. The
other members each took a turn
with a solo drawing out the song to
the delight of the crowd. We both
felt that this song allowed the mu-

sicians to actually explore their —

musical talent rather than just per-
form in a standard format. We felt
that most of their other songs were
formats, such as “Dancing Vir-
ginia,” their most popular song.

Another sound that the band
interspersed within these formats
was the rap-like, G Love-esque
sound of such songs as “U Can
Look.” Although it was not totally
spontaneous, it did have a more
heart-felt performance than some
of the other songs. Matt, the mis-
cellaneous musician, added his
sexy aura to the lyrics of the song.
Musically, Jump, Little Children
still lacked originality, but the beat
kept the crowd swaying.

Overall, their show lent itself
quite well to small venues and col-

. lege shows. Musical talent did not

abound but performance aura un-
failingly enticed the crowd. Hope-
fully, Jump, Little Children will
return to Davidson for another
crowd-riling show, since they
claimed that the Davidson College
atmosphere was the best college
show that they had ever played.

have to put on a show. I did my
best to finish the feast, but my

biggest problem actually turned

out to be fitting the burger into my
mouth, for it was stacked with fix-
ings over a large slab of beef.

At the end of the repast, ev-
eryone was satiated, and all were
glad that we had made the trek
down to Charlotte for some real
food. I would recommend this
culinary experience to all of you,
even lettuce-munchers disgusted
by the phrase “slab of beef,” for
Lupie’s can satisfy a range of ap-
petites. And if it can satiate me, a
man who once consumed 13 sloppy
joes in a single sitting, you can
probably assume that you will leave
with a pleasantly full feeling in
your belly.
