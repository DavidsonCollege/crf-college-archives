THE DAVIDSONIAN

VICTIMS

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Lately (for the past 30 years), a large
number of Davidson students have been the
victims of a strange disease. This unique
malady, characterized by wild looks, loss of
sleep, poor class preparation and general de-
lirium, is known as bridge.

Notice the bridge players pictured here:
their intense concentration, followed by the
careful, considered play of the wrong card.
Note the lone example of joyous surprise, in-
dicating absolutely nothing. Whatever play
has caused this look will later be proved
by the player’s partner to be irresponsible,
incredibly feeble-minded, and not at all what
he would have done. Any attempts to justi-
fy himself (“But you told me to do that!”)
will only lead to further fury from the part-
ner.

Bridge players may be distinguished from
people by two main points: their total devo-
tion to the game, and their firm conviction
that they, individually. are the only. ones
who know how to play it. Experts may be
distinguished by their ability to blame every-
thing on their partners. The concentration
on these players’ faces is not a result of their
figuring which card to play but of figuring
how to blame it on their partner after the
hand.

Furthermore, a close look at the players
will . . . will you excuse me for a moment,
please?

“Wait a minute; ! thought I won taat trick.
You trumped it! That was my ace, you moron.
Of all the stupid, ridiculous. @&@!c* .. .”

meetings each year the chapter
tries to bring to the faculty pro-
grams dealing with ‘broader
subjects of general professional
interest to people.”

* FUTURE PROGRAMS

Later in the year, the AAUP
chapter will hear speakers rep-
resenting the Southeast and the
nation as a whole in an effort
to discover trends that are de-
veloping in American higher
education.

Started in 1915, the AAUP
has members representing 1.400
institutions. There are 728 lo
cal chapters: in the United
States. Davidson's chapter rep-
cesents 55 to 60 per cent of the
faculty. ‘

retary-treasurer: and Drs. J. T.
Drake and J. O. Embry. mem-
bers-at-large of the executive
committee.

The Davidson chapter func-
tions for the benefit. of the
faculty. It has just completed
a compartive study of teaching
loads in 32 selected colleges and
universities. Similar studies

are carried on by sister insti-|

tutions.

The chapter has helped to
bring about good contract and
tenure policies and a program
of salary increases at Davidson.
It has also functioned success-
fully as a committee of arbi-
tration when it bas been called
into a dispute between faculty
and administration.

Dr. Kelton commented, ‘‘Some
people view AAUP ‘as a ‘union’ |
of the faculty working against
the ‘management’ of adminis-
tration. This is misleading be-
cause the goals of faculty and
administration are usually simi-_

lar. AAUP provides for an ex-
pression of the faculty point of
view concerning, the achieve-
ment of these goals. We have a
very fine: relationship of co-:
operation with the ‘college ad-;
ministration.”
