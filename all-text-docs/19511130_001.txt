In Monday Blood Donation

Gov. Kerr Scott |Officials Hoping
Joins Forum List To Top 500 Mark

With hopes for 500 pints the American Red Cross will
conduct a Blood Drive in the Davidson community on Monday,
December 3, between the hours of 11 a.m., and 5 p.m. This
particular blood drive is especially important, because ur-

Governor Kerr Scott of North
Carolina has accepted an invitation
to speak in chapel on Wednesday,
12, Hubert Cannon, chair-
man of the YMCA Forum Com-
mittee, announced today, bringing

to three the number of outstand-

ee OOOO

ing political figures on the Decem-
ber Forum program.

As was-reported last week, Con-
gressman J. P. Richards (D-SC),
chairman of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, will tall at Tues-
day's chapel; and Senator Clyde
R. Hoey (R-N.C.), is scheduled for
the chapel period on Thursday, De-
cember 13. ;

The subject of Governor Scott's
address will be “The State Level
of Government,” and Cannon be-
lieves it should prove especially in-
teresting to those who have fol-
lowed North Carolina politics for

the past three years. This will mark
the governor's first visit to the
Davidson campus.

All these speakers, procured
largely through the efforts of
Hubert Cannon and Jesse Fish-
er, are being brought to David-
son in connection with the
YMCA Forum on “Christianity
and Politics,” which will take
the form of a panel discussion
to be held in the Y Lounge
Wednesday night, December 12.

Serving on the panel will be
Mayor Victor Shaw of Charlotte
and William Pope, a member of
the State Legislature from Moores-
ville. Although the chapel speakers
méhtioned above will’ not be on
the panel, the talks will have di-
rect bearing on Christianity and
its relation to politics today.

Jerry Lewis O. K's
Annual Beauties

Film and TV star Jerry Lewis will judge photo entries for
the beauty section of the annual Quips and Cranks this year by
special agreement with Paramount Studios’ Charlotte branch. He
will rank them according to pulchritude in his Hollywood office.

Engineered by editor Bill Adams,
the plan was conceived so as to get
someone “unusual” to do the judg-
ing this year rather than such old
standbys as John Powers or Clark

Of the girls entered a queen will
be chosen, a runner-up and four
attendants.

“If he showed enough knowl-
edge of women to get Dagmar on
his TV show, he ought to be able
to do the job,” commented Carlyle
Crenshaw, beauty section head.

Wanting to get someone “crazy,
unusual and having a big name,”
Adams and Crenshaw quickly
settled on Lewis after seeing him
in “That's My Boy.”

Lewis has been contacted by the
Charlotte branch office of + Para-
mount studios, for whom Lewis
stars.

Commenting on the selection,
Stuart Shippey, secretary of the
film society said, “The low brow
Philistines around here ought to
be able to appreciate this one. Some
of the others have been too high

hold the interest of the students.”

However, the possibilities of the
plot are interesting as it places the
traditional spy story in various
complications, with the hero find-
ing a dead woman in his apart-
ment, and numerous hair-raising

In reviewing the policy of the
film society for this semester,
Shippey had this to say: “We are
trying to have a_ well-balanced
program for the semester. We had
a foreign film (French), a comedy,
an American film, and now a British
production.”

Notice was also given that

College Stand|Picked Sketches

On Cage Meet

Athletic Director P. K. Scott
moved this week to clarify the er-
roneous assumption that Davidson
College is sponsoring the First An-
nual Basketball Tournament in the
sparione Armory, December 28 and

The Charlotte Symphony Society
is sponsoring the event with Da-
vidson only an interested partici-
pant. South: Carolina, Auburn and
Georgia Tech will complete the
field,

Scott emphasized that while
Davidson is giving full support
to the tournament, the College
is in no way connected with the
tournament organization.

Coach Boyd Baird added that the

-| Davidson Cagers, when the question

arose concerning holiday participa-
tion, voted unanimously to cut
short their Christmas vacation in
order to play in the tournament.

Med Interview
Cuts Get Nod

Pre-meds draining their allowed
cut quota by attending interviews
at med schools got some’ relief last
week when the executive commit-
tee voted them limited unexcused
absences, ’

If a man has “reasonable assur-
ance” of being accepted to med
school within 12 months he may
apply for free cuts after the first
interview involving three or more
class absences,

The first three class absences,
however, must come out of the
student’s allowed quota.

Each man can then ask for free
cuts not to exceed five if he finds
additional interviews necessary.

Greek Functions
Begin Celebrating
Yule Merriment

In line with the seasonal Decem-
ber merriment, three fraternities
and the Campus Club will be cele-
brating Saturday night with social
functions.

The KA's, dressed in costumes
representing characters of history
and fiction, will enjoy themselves
at the Woman's Club in Charlotte
with a banquet and masquerade

Concord will also get a glimpse of
Davidson's way of celebrating as the
Kappa Sigs observe. their annual
Black and White formal Saturday
night.

Neither will Statesville feel neg-

lected. this weekend since the Pi-
kas will follow their pledges to the
Statesville Lions’ Club where the
group will be entertained by the
brother-to-be with a buffet sup-
per and dance.
- On the campus a mountaineer
spirit will prevail at Erwin Lodge.
The Campus Club members and
their dates will spend the evening
square dancing to the tunes of old
time barn dances.

Cornelia Otis Skinner will present a series of her famous
dramatic monologues Monday night, Dec. 3, at 8:15 p.m., in

Chambers Auditorium.

Because her most successful per-
formances are achieved with the
mood of each audience in mind,
Miss Skinner will choose and an-
nounce the sketches at the time of
the performance.

Typical Program

One of her standard programs
consists of six sketches, including
“Being Presented,” “Homework,”
“Times Square,” “Hotel Porch” and
“Nurse’s Day Off.”

Miss Skinner, like many other
actresses, began her career with
many secondary parts in secondary
plays. But such dull fare was not
for long.

She decided to go out on her
own. Her success with monologues
won her the title of “the greatest
single attraction in the American
theatre.”

First Fame

She first gained international
fame with her presentations of "The
Wives of Henry VII,” “The Loves
of Charles 11" and “The Empress
Eugenie.” :

Then she wrote and performed the
first of her character sketches—in
the beginning for her friends and
later professionally.

These sketches were so popular
that soon. she was making tours
across the U, S., to Canada and
London.

CORNELIA OTIS SKINNER

Miss Skinner, who is the second
speaker of the Davidson Celebrity
Series, has won wide acclaim for
her two novels, “Family Circle,”
and “Our Hearts Were Young and
Gay.”

Alpha Psi Omega is planning to
have a reception for Miss Skinner
at the YMCA Guest House follow-
ing her performance.

Unissued Ballots
Delay Election

Failure of ‘‘about half’’ of the sophomore class to receive

ballots at chapel this morning

necessitates the holdover until

Monday the run-off election between Bill Freeman and Kirk
Oglesby for student representative on the athletic council.

Vice-president Lyman Kiser, in
charge of the election, said that
due to the program’s length, ballots
did not reach about half of the
sophomore class, hence giving them
no voice in the election.

President Mac McLean said that
ballots already returned would be
kept until Monday, at which time
they will be tabulated along with
those of the sophomores who did
not have the opportunity to vote
today and who will do so Monday.

Other student government action
today saw the student body vote
in the amendment whereby the
three editors and three business
‘managers of the campus publica-
tions will automatically form the
student representation on the Pub-
lications Board.

Notice

Permission has been granted to
Davidson to remove the federal
tax from the price of the Celebrity
Series tickets.

General admission tickets are
$1.51 rather than $1.80 and date
tickets are $1 rather than $1.20.
No refund is due on student
tickets.

Students who have not gotten
their tickets may get them at 113
Chambers or in the lobby at Cham-
bers before Miss Skinner's lecture.

Student Paper

Mirrors Views

Student opinion at Davidson will
have a less-choked outlet in the
near future according to a small
gtoup of students who plan to
publish an independent newspaper.

Of tabloid size it will be pri-
marily devoted to divulging
facts which have not been

“properly emphasized” regard-

ing controversial issues in the

student body.

Though there will be no regular
publication dates, the paper will
be given out when its staff decides
there is more to be said concerning
some important student business.

According to Mike Myers, a key
figure in the organization of this
paper, those writers who have been
definitely signed are Stuart Ship-
pey, Buddy Lamon, Jack Hunter,
Ed Stuart and Sam Hope. George
Irvin is ta serve as business man-
ager.

At the time of announcement
the paper was planned to be mimeo-
graphed, but Myers said that if de-

Slanted ROTC Movies Spread
UN Propaganda Thick at D. C.

By JOHN OTTLEY .

Well into his third year at Da-yjsome war films in lieu of the reg-
vidson, John Puremind was rather | ular drill,

proud of himself, In various courses
here his intellectual character had

‘been more‘or less doveloped so that

he could wear with confidnce the
semblance of a sneer which he ex-
hibited toward frosh.

John most of all was genuinely
appreciative of a sense of tolerance
toward ideas and the persons who
sponsored them.

Only the other day his
philosophy professor had em-
phasized tolerance as a vital
point if one would see life more
realistically.

Then one rainy Tuesday after-
noon John P. was invited by the

Though purporting to be news
films of a UN counterattack
and an unbiased account of the
first peace talks, John’s pure
mind quickly saw the movies
had a special meaning for him
and his classmates.

Shown him first was the pictorial

reporting of a victorious UN coun-

ter-drive northward smashing in
lightning fashion the Communist
“iron triangle” base at Chorwon.

With a rash of exploding high ex-
plosives and shots of smiling in-
fantrymen happy at their work,
John was positively convinced that
newspaper reports of UN soldiers

angle for days must have been in-
accurate if not false.

He couldn't really see any
Communists “being slaugh-
tered,” but the confident and
almost shouting voice of the
commentator proved indubita-
bly that the films weren’t taken
in the California mountains and
{ifted from a “B”’ movie.

Surely the philosophy prof must
have been mistaken though young
John as he watched the mean Reds
maltreat our truce team. They had
no right to threaten UN delegates
with fully loaded weapons.
