An Onmission

The curriculum study committee is
now filled and ready to undertake a
prolonged examination of the college’s
entire academic structure. Yet there
has been an obvious omission so far:
Not a single student representative
has been named to the committee.

Though no provisions have been
made for such a student member,
Dean of the Faculty Frontis Johnston,
who will head the group, has agreed
to ask the committee to consider the
possibility when it begins meeting.
For the nine-member group to refuse
to accept a student member would be
an affront to the student body and the
college itself, as it tries to picture
itself as a progressive liberal arts
school.

For the committee to agree to mere-
ly hear student opinion is not enough;
students. need a guarantee that their
ideas will be presented through a vot-
ing member of the committee. The
trend in modern educational circles
is towards allowing a greater student
voice in administrative policies.

At Chatham College in Pittsburgh,
where students are helping screen fac-

ulty prospects, President Edward G.
Eddy Jr. sees “genuine student in-
volvement in the formation of educa-
tional policy’ as offering the “best
hope of regaining the lost concept of
an academic community,” according
to National Observer.

This is no new idea at Davidson,
and where it has been utilized previ-
ously, students have shown a great
deal of maturity. The most salient ex-
amples are those of the Religious Life
Committee, which was instrumental in
bringing about the changed college
policy towards worship, and the Social
Life Committees, which were largely
responsible for the improved social
atmosphere on campus.

Placing a student on the committee
could by no means be considered al-
lowing students to dominate policy,
nor should it be. Faculty members are
professional educators, more familiar
with. the needs of modern academic
life. But at the same time, students
have a unique viewpoint deserving
regular representation on a committee
which could well bring about the most
important changes in Davidson’s his-

tory.

Orientation Ordeal

The Class of 1970 is now “oriented”
to Davidson life — at the cost of, in
most cases, a week-long ordeal of
meetings, speeches and tests, when in
truth the entire process of Freshman
Camp and Orientation could be tele-
scoped into the time now taken for
Orientation alone.

A number of faculty members are
concerned that by Sunday of Orienta-
tion many freshmen were becoming
disenchanted with the whole process,
and the formal atmosphere of the fac-
ulty reception Sunday afternoon did
nothing to mitigate the feeling. Dur-
ing the first two days of the week, the
freshmen, eager to begin classes, were-
faced instead with more tests and
speeches.

The most significant reason for the
freshmen’s boredom lies in the host
of unnecessary activities incorporated
in the orientation program, not to

mention the hours of free time the
freshmen find on their hands, with no
constructive means of utilizing it.

One and one-half days are used for
issuing ROTC uniforms, taking PE
tests and library tours. The PE and
ROTC activities could be administered
much more efficiently by the respec-
tive departments during class time,
while the most practical system of in-
troducing freshmen to the library
could be undertaken by faculty mem-
bers who could present the library to
the freshmen in the context with
which the new Davidsonians would be
using that institution.

The orientation process would be
much more meaningful if such re-
forms could be undertaken. Freshmen
are probably the most eager group on
campus to learn, and it would be
shameful to leave a bitter ,taste in
their mouth during their first expos-
ure to college life.

Whither The Laundry?

The manner in which laundry prices
were raised over the summer Is un-
fortunate, to say the least. Unlike last
year’s price hike, which was made
early enough to be included in the
catalogue students had no way of
knowing of the second increase until
a month ago.

It has never been a secret that the
laundry operated at a loss and that a
price rise would be likely for the
1966-67 year. But it was not until late
May that the Business Office began
definitely making plans for the next
year’s operation.

At that time, the last edition of THE
DAVIDSONIAN had been published
and only a small number of students

knew of the possibility of a rise in.

prices and of the alternatives to a
price rise.

The understanding given then to
certain students was that the laundry
would probably undergo approximate-
ly a $10,000 loss in the coming year
if it continued to operate at the rate
of $85 per student. But officials of the
Business Office indicated that the col-
lege budget would allow the laundry
to operate at such a loss for another
year. In the meantime a realistic plan
for erasing the deficit could be worked
out, to the satisfaction of both student
needs and financial necessity.

It was further understood that
should prices be raised over the sum-
mer, an alternative would be provided.
Among those mentioned were the
possibility of installing coin-operated
washing machines for laundering
clothes needing no ironing, which

could be operated in conjunction. with
a laundry charging on a per-piece ba-:
sis, rather than a flat yearly rate.

No such alternative has been pro-
vided, and students are faced with the
same laundry setup, with the same
second-class work and. the same one-
bag-per week restriction.

The new figure paid for laundry
comes very near to what one would
pay at a commercial laundry, which
can guarantee top quality service. In-
deed, many students are probably pay-
ing more than they would for com-
mercial service.

There is no doubt that rising labor
costs, which are going up constantly,
are making the laundry more and
more costly to operate. And there is
no doubt that the peculiar nine-month
operation of the college laundry
makes it difficult to keep employes.

But that doesn’t alter the fact that
requiring every student to subscribe
to the college laundry service at a
commercial rate is unfair.

Laundry officials have said that be-
cause records are already kept on each
package of laundry that is brought in,
it would be no more expensive to keep
records and charge by the piece rate.
Such a method would be much more
equitable to all concerned.

The laundry is, after all, provided
primarily for student convenience and
this should be its goal. Naturally it
should be financially solvent, but this

oal should not cause the college to
ose sight of the laundry’s primary
purpose.

Where's The Court?

An interesting contradiction ap-
pears in the 1966-67 edition of the

ildeat Handbook: Joe Jelks’ letter to
the freshmen states matter-of-factly
on page 7 that “there will be no court
or regulations this year,” referring to
the Freshman Court.

Yet, Section 5 of the Bylaws to the
Student Council (or is it Section 6,
since there are two Section 2's?) ex-
plicitly outlines the organization and
duties of the Freshman Court.

Admittedly, the court has degen-
erated in the past several years to a
point where it had become something
of a joke to freshmen called upon to
answer such charges as not wearing
beanies or walking across the grass.

Yet it is too arbitrary a step to com-

pletely disband the court simply be-
cause some individuals find it ineffec-
tual. Either it should be restructured
or done away with. If the latter course
is followed, the normal procedure for
amending the constitution should be
followed.

If the former course is taken, steps
should be taken to get the court in
step with 1966—the court should con-
centrate on Davidson traditions, rath-
er than such trivia as failure to wear
name tags or to speak to others on
campus. .

hichever course is taken, it will
be preferable to the present situation,
in which the student body is out in
the cold as to what is the actual status
of the court.

EASY TRANSITION

Warm Welcome Is Theme Of Orientation

By SAM DARBY
Staff Writer

This article was intended as
a satire of Orientation Week.
We thought that we would
mimie Dr. Johnston and Miss
Brittain, and then the various
hall counselors (aotably Chief
Owen and his unforgettable in-
ftiation speech); then move
on to a humorous look at
French tests and the confes-
sions of a $24,000-a-year bas-
ketball coach (left-out Grea-
selle); topping the whole thing
off with additions to tne fresh-
man beanie (cape, boots,
tights: Fresh Man).

Handbook Termed Better

Than Its Predecessors

A Review

By GEOFF SEAMANS
Staff Writer

The 1966-67 Wildcat Hand-
book, while not perfect, is an
improvement over recent is-

sues of the publication. Com.

pared to last year's edition,
the new Handbook is better
written, more informative and
more handsomely bound.

One assures that the gen-
eral attitudes which formed
the publication are expressed
in the Poreword. For this rea-
son, an analysis of the Fore-
word seems helpful in an at-
tempt to articulate a response
to the work.

The Foreword of this year's
Handbook is definitely superi-
or to last year’s. Both contain
the usual cautionary para-
graph pointing out that the
italicized parts contain merely
the opinions of the writer.

WARNING

Alva Whitehead, this year's
editor, assumes a very un-
Olympian stance in his warn-
ing against taking the editorial
matter too seriously. He rec-
ognizes a divergence of opin-
jon within the student body:
“Search for the ‘Golden
Mean’,” philosophizes White-
head, ‘‘between what we may
write and others may say.”

The editor: of the 1965-66
Handbook also found a diverg-
ence in campus opinion, but
in the form of a dichotomy be-
tween official college position
and student body opinion. In
contrast to Whitehead, last
year’s editor makes no men-
tion of divergence of opinion
within. the student body. White-
head’s remarks seem more
complete and thus accurate.

SUPERIOR LANGUAGE

Whitehead's use of the lan-
guage is also superior to the

Style of last year’s Handbook.
For instance, one finds ‘o the
1966-57 edition no run-on sen-
tences, in contrast to the first
sentence of last year’s Fore-
word. Also, Whitehead's de-
scription of last year’s Social
Council as ‘‘virgin’’ is infi-
nitely fresher and more ap-
pealing than anything in the
Foreword of last year’s issue.

One quibble, however, is in
order. Typographical errors
are numerous throughout the
Handbook, and the Foreword
is no different from the rest
of the work. One assumes that
“bias’’ should be ‘“‘biased”’ in
the last paragraph, and one
hopes that the misspelling of
“knowledgeable” in the first
line of the sécond paragraph
is simply a typographical er-
ror.

LACKS COLOR

The major criticism this re-
viewer levels against the 1966-
67 Wildcat Handbook is not so
much what it contains but

‘B.C.
YOUR MONEY or Your

«NOW IM GOING To
LET YOU Go THis TIME,

what it doesn't. This kind of
criticism violates a cardinal
rule of book reviewing and is
perhaps unfair; nonetheless,
one wishes that excellent
piéces like Gary DeVane’s
“So You Want to Be a David-
son Gentleman” in the 1965-66
Handbook could be repeated
from year to year along with
the more pedestrian, banal
stuff Mke the Student Body
Constitution and the Faculty
Regulations,

In addition, highly contro-
versial areas of campus life
(e.g., fraternities) could be
portrayed with greater can-
dor. Perhaps a solution would
be to allow people with differ-
ing opinions to editorialize on
the same subject.

Other improvements briefly
noted are the inclusion of a
map of the town of Davidson
and a reduction in the num-
ber of freshmen without pic-
tures. Also, combining the re-
ligion and military sections
adds a nice touch.

Fools’ Faces

By EDWARD DWELLE Z

Associate Editor i

Of Fools And Fools

WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL
DICTIONARY defines the noun fool as “a person lack-
ing in judgment or prudence” and continues to elab-
orate on this concept for about a half of a column,
while the OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY spends
almost a full page giving the historical background
of the word.

Indeed, the concept of the fool has been greatly
used and abused in our Western Civilization from
Biblical times on. The fool in the Bible is not partic-
ularly a silly man but. one who is utterly corrupt in
his moral character.

The first verse of Psalm 14 condemns the fool
quite plainly: “The Fool says .in his heart, ‘There
is no God.’ They are corrupt, they do abominable
deeds, there ‘is none that does good.” Someplace else
I think the Scripture says that you will be damned in
Hell if you call someone a fool, but I can’t find the
passage at present. We are all competent Bible schol-
ars here at Davidson.

That other great source of wisdom for Anglo-
Saxon man, the works of Will Shakespeare, makes
frequent reference to the fool or fools; and, in King
Lear, the Fool is a central figure. For the Shakespear-
ean world, the fool was a symbol for that type of per-
son who wavered on the, line between craziness and:
genius. He was both wise and stupid, mixing his wis-
dom with his puns and foolery. But he was more
often right than not.

I’m something of a fool. We're fond of categories
and labels here so I will label myself a fool; you may
attach whatever connotation to the word you may
desire. I plan to write this column every once in a
while and to spout at will about whatever comes my
way; I invite any criticism or comments which any-
one who is foolish enough to read my dribble (not
Dibble) may care to submit.

‘Browning’ Hinders Faculty Relations

In fact I’m going to spout a bit of criticism my-
self this week: I should like to beseech that mythical
“typical Davidson student” to refrain from constant-
ly accusing his “fellow students” of “browning pro-
fessors.” All of you elderly readers will recognize
this phenomenon as “apple polishing.”

The size of this college obviously has its disad-
vantages as well as advantages; one of the most im-
portant of the latter is the opportunity to have a rel-
atively close personal relationship with one’s pro-
fessors. You may not think much of a professor’s
teaching ability, but I will guarantee you that each
one of these men has a wealth of experience and
knowledge which can benefit you and make your un-
dergraduate career more rewarding than you would
imagine.

I think that the accusations and kidding of his

peers can be very damaging to a student’s attempt
to form an out-of-class relationship with a professor.
Perhaps seniors are not as susceptible to this type
of conformity, but it seems to be fairly prevalent at
all levels. There is no reason for it; if you don’t want
to take advantage of the situation, don’t prevent an-
other person from doing so.
____ That’s the negative side of my criticism; the pos-
itive side is quite simple: Get to know those profess-
ors that you can, wherever you can, whenever you
can. No more need be said.

In conjunction with this last point, I want to
urge that you visit faculty homes whenever you can.
There is no Open House schedule for this Sunday
night, but it will begin soon. Each year it seems that
Freshmen are the only students who visit on Sunday
nights; but if some of the upperclassmen would par-
ticipate these visitations could become more than an
apa and tun” affair. Moreover, there are some wives

at are i i i
husbands! more interesting than their

t is quite possible that one could learn as much
or more from his non-classroom experiences with a
professor than in any formal class situation. Pre-
sumably you're here to learn, and I think this is one
of the best ways to do so.

t the least, don’t criticize those who try to‘form
genuine friendships with their professors. You'll be
a fool it wou ge criticize them in your bull sessions.
