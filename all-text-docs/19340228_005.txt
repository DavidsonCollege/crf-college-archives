Radio Program to Be Broadcast
Over Station WBT,
Charlotte

The ninety-seventh anniversary of
the founding of Davidson College will
be celebrated on April 12, following
the action taken by the trustees at
their semi-annual meeting last week.

This will be the first official Found-
ers’ Day ever observed by Davidson,
and the college is following the cus-
tom of other leading colleges and uni-
versities in the country in having this
annual observation. The date has been
set for the 12th since.this is the most
convenient date near April 7th, which
was the date of the laying of the cor-
nerstone of the first building at David-
son in 1837.

Plans for the celebration of the an-
niversary are not yet complete, but a
complete program of observance at the
college will be arranged for that day,
with a prominent speaker selected
from the Alumni Association to make
the address. Another feature on the
program’ will be a musical program
by the college music department. That
night a radio program will be broad-
cast from Station WBT in Charlotte,
which will be listened to by the alumni
clubs which will be meeting.

Alumni chapters all over the country
will hold their regular annual meeting
on that night, and the chapters which
are near enough to Davidson will have
speakers sent from the college to ad-
dress them. They will listen to the
radio broadcast from Charlotte.

The centennial program which was
adopted at the meeting of the trustees
will be announced at that time to the
alumni and to the public. Davidson wil!
be one hundred years old in 1937, and
a program to be achieved by that time
was passed by the board at its meetiny
last week.

Officers of all the Davidson alumni
chapters*fave been written and urged
to have meetings of their chapters on
the night of April 12. An alumni maga-
zine will be published around the first
of April, and will be sent to all the
alumni, This magazine will announce
the definite plans that have been made
for meetings, and will inform the
alumni where the meetings will be held.

It is éxpected that the observance
of Founders’ Day will become an an-
nual event at Davidson. The celebra-
tion of the centennial in 1937 will in-
clude a large program.
