| DIES OF PNEUMONIA

Alumni Are Saddened by the Death
of One of Their Number

The friends and classmates of
.Rev. Henry Fournoy Morton, ’08, of

: Farmville, N. C., will be saddened to
York City ,

hear of his death in New

jon the 14th of this month, after a
brief illness with influenza-pneu-
{monia. His body was brought to his
childhood home at Rocky Mount,
N.C., where it was interred on Mon-
day, the 16th.

During his career at Davidson
-Mr. Morton was one of the leading
_tnen of his class, being a good all-
[round man. He was especially
prominent as a speaker and singer.

Leaving Davidson, he entered
-Union Theological Seminary, from
/which institution he graduated in
ithe class of 1911. During his last
| year at. the Seminary he married
Miss Hassell.

Since that time, Mr. Morton has

been engaged in work at his pas-!

torate in Albemarle Presbytery,
| where he enjoyed a very successful
‘ministry. His loss is mourned by a
‘large number of friends and ac-
!quaintances in that part of the state,
as well as elsewhere.

L. A. BAIN IS VICTIM

OF PNEUMONIA

President of Senior Class of Presby-
terian Theological Seminary Dies
Following Attack of Influenza.

Funeral services of Lattie Alfred
Bain, '16, who died of pneumonia
following an attack of influenza, in
the Preshyterian Seminary at Louis-
ville, Ky., on February 13, were con-
ducted at Lebanon Church, Cumber-
land county, Monday afternoon by
Rev. A. R. McQueen, minister of the
; Presbyterian Church.
| Mr. Bain was a member of and
president of the Senior class of the
Seminary, and lacked only two
jmonths of completing his theologi-
cal course. In the recent examina-
tions he led the entire student body.
He was 28 years of age and a son
of S. A. Bain, who recently moved
to Dunn, from Wade, N. C.
Speaking of him, Rev. Mr. Me-
, Queen said that he had never known
‘a finer young man; nor one who
‘gave more promise of usefulness in
his chosen work. His fellow-stu-
dents, both at Davidson and at the
Presbyterian Seminary, were im-
pressed with his sturdiness of char-
acter and his excellence as a man.

/Mr. Geiss, of the faculty, accom-
panied the body home.

Mr. Bain is survived by his fath-
er, two brothers and three sisters.

Not long ago, just four weeks and
‘a half, to be exact, R. R. Clarke, ’19, |
‘was made a deacon of the Estill:
Presbyterian Church. When “Ru- | Th B V d C

er in the athletic world. His pitch-,
ing was the backbone of our base- ,

the church we feel confident that |
“Railroad” will make his rise in civil |
life just as surely as he did in col-

A “DRY” TOAST.

There’s a laugh in the NAME,
There’s a smile in the brew:
There's the taste of the same
We drank long ago, too.
It functions just right,
For it’s full of good cheer,
It’s a nation’s delight,
For it’s NOT a “near beer.”
It brings words to the tongue,
And a light to the eye,
While from memory’s wrung
Thoughts of glad days gone by.
Here’s a toast to the old,
That we drink with the new
MINNEHAHA, that’s sold
As a real lagered brew.
