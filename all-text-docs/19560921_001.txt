Quips and Cranks
Staff Begins Work

Quips and Cranks, the Davidson
year-book, is now in the preoess of
formation, Ed Young, editor of the
annual announced this week.

Contracts with ‘the printer, en-
graver and portrait photographer
have been completed, and the staff
is already beginning to prepare the
material which will make up the
volume which will be distributed
to students at the end of spring
semester.

Both editorial and business staffs
of this publication have begun
what they term as “extensive work
to present a readable. durable, and
well-planned yearbook.”

Young has expressed special in-
terest in finding new writers, pho-
tographers, and office personnel to
join him and his staff.

The individual portraits of stu-
dents. will be handled in a differ-
ent manner from that of previous
years, Representatives from Smith
Studios will begin to photograph
students September 25. Pictures
will be made by fraternity rather
than by Class. Notices will be
posted as to the exact date for
each fraternity to be photographed.

Car Influx Reason For
Parking Permit Plan

an instructor in English.

Prof. McLane graduated from
Austin College in Texas, and has
done graduate work at Illinois In-

stitute of Technology, Harvard Uni-
versity, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Texas A. & M. He
is Assistant Professor of Physics.

Mr. Ratterree and Mr. Thompson
joined the athletic coaching staff
during the summer. Both are assis-
tant coaches in football, while
Thompson will also coach swim
ming and Ratterree baseball. Mr.
Ratterree graduated from Wake
Forest and earned the M.A. gegree
at Appalachian State College, while
Mr. Thompson earned both the
B.S. and M.A. degrees at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina.

Prof. Williams graduated from
Davidson in 1916, and earned the
M.A. degree from New York Uni-
versity. He has had a varied and
successful career in business and
is Visiting Professor of Business
Administration.

Beginning with this semester,
Davidson College has yielded to
the example followed by most of
her neighboring institutions in re-
quiring that the automobiles which
remain on the campus during the
school session have a parking per-
mit displayed on their windshields.

The inauguration of this plan has
been necessitated by the growing
number of cars belonging to mem-
bers of the student body. This in
turn has caused it to be much more
difficult to secure a parking space,
not only for students, but also for
the ever-increasing number of visi-
tors on the campus.

The money received in payment
for the permits will be applied
with certain other funds toward
further improvement of campus
parking facilities.
