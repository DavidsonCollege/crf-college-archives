Seeing is believing.

At 10:57 p.m., CNN declared
Barack Obama the winner of the
state of Virginia. People cheered,
jumped up and down, hugged each
other, danced around and gave each
other high fives.

But the cheer increased to a
roar just three minutes later. People
knew what was coming, but “see-
ing it on the screen—that’s what
did it,” said Pat Sellers, a professor
of political science who helped or-
ganize the election night party.

At 11 p.m. CNN declared Ba-
rack Obama the winner of the Pres-
idential election. What followed
was an incredible outpouring of
emotion from countless students
in the 900 Room. Suddenly, just
as the polls in California, Oregon
and Washington closed and those
words declaring Obama President
flashed on the screen, the cheers
became deafening. The room sud-
denly transformed into standing-
room-only status as people stood
on chairs and tables, danced, cried
and called and texted their friends
and family.

ITS to reduce paper
waste from printing

In the next few weeks, Infor-
mation Technology Services will
be unveiling two new projects.
PawPrint, a new printing system,
will reduce printer-paper waste in
public computing areas, contribut-
ing to Davidson’s ecological com-
mitment. The second project, the

creation of two new group study
rooms in the Belk computer lab,
plans give students a comfort-
able and technologically advanced
workplace.

The issue of massive printer

paper waste has become prominent -

Seniors face shortage
in lab requirment slots

Katie LOVETT
Staff Writer

Registrar Hansford Epes con-
firmed that there are always a
number of seniors who enter their
final semester with the fulfillment
of some core requirements still
remaining. 140 students from the
class of 2009 have not completed
and are not registered for 1 or more
of their requirements and 35 seniors
out of this group will be vying for
48 spots in the two most popular
non-science major lab courses, Hu-
man Biology and Chemistry of Art
and Artifacts.

“T take it for granted that seniors
know how to use WebTree,” Epes
said. “I was alarmed by how fool-
ishly some trees were filled out for
the fall semester.” Sixteen of the 35
students who have not completed
their lab requirement did not have a
lab course listed anywhere on their
trees for first semester.

It is possible that a handful of
these seniors could utilize And-

vanced Placement credits to com-
pensate for their lack of comple-
tion of core requirements. “There
is no doubt that there are some AP
credits out there that students never
had sent to Davidson,” Epes said.
However, AP scores must be of-
ficially reported to the college in
order to receive credit for these ex-
ams. Some students seem to adopt
the attitude, “even though it doesn’t
show up on Shirley, I still have the
AP credit,” Epes said.

A maximum of four course
credits may be achieved through
AP, JB or joint enrollment courses
and if a student qualifies for more
than four, they will have the oppor-
tunity to select which credits to ap-
ply towards graduation.

Academic advisers emphasize
a timeline for completion of core
requirements in initial meetings
with their first year students. Each
Davidson student must complete a
composition (W-Course), foreign
