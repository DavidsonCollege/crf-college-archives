Money Talks To. Acceptees

The score reads: Davidson
1, South Carolina O. Basket-
ball? Hardly. The game is
admissions, and according
to a survey released this
week by H. Edmunds White,
director of admissions, Da-
vidson was able to capture
the majority of such admis-
sions contests with other
schools.

This September, according
to White, Davidson enrolled
61 percent of the students
It had accepted last year. In
an effort to find out exactly
why Davdison lost the other
190 applicants, White mailed
a questionaire to those stu-
dents.

Of the 160 letters returned,
W~ listed Davidson's high
costs and 71 listed better
financial ‘aid offers from
other schools as their rea-
sons for going elsewhere.

The reason listed most as
primary in a student's re-
jecting Davidson was the
better aid..offer at another
school.

The presence of coeds at
another school was listed’ by
thirty applicants as one of
the factors in their decision
to reject Davidson.

Other factors considered
by: applicants turning “down
the Davidson offer were. ciiy
campuses at other colleges
(23 students), stronger aca-
demic . programs elsewhere
(35 students), and larger
student bodies at other
schools (21 students).

Minor considerations ,seem-
ed to be the location of
school which 19 students
felt was too far from their
homes and five _ students
felt was too close to home.

White went on, in the re-
port, to analyze Davidson's

record against other sctiools
in instances where two
schools accepted the same
applicart.

Only seven schocis beat
Davidson by -nore than one
applicant. These schools _ in-
cluded Dartmouth (7-2),
Harvard (4-1), John Hopkins

WHITE
. a winner

(3:1), the U.S. Military Aca-

. demy (5-2), the U.S. Naval

Academy (40), Wesleyan
(2-0), and Yale (6-1).

White also revealed that
among the ‘larger  institu-
tions in North Carolina, Da-
vidson. garnered by far the
greater number of mutually
accepted applicants.

‘Duke and Davidson ac-
cepted 60 of the same stu-
dents and Davidson got 40
of those. 46 of the 65 appli-
cants accepted in common
with U.N.C. came .to David-
son. With Wake Forest, Da-
vidson accepted 32 students,
26 of whom enrolled at Da-
vidson.

Among schyols_— in the
Southeast, Davidson beat
Emory 154, Vanderbilt 314,
Florida Presbyterian 3.2,
and the University of Vir-
ginia 19-8.

Davidson also beat Prince-
ton by a score of four ap-
plicants to three.

Town To Get Youth Center

By ADRIAN LONG
Associate Editor

The Community Relations
Council (ORC) has announc-
ed that a new multi-purpose
youth center for junior and
senior high school students
is being planned for the town
of Davidson.

The center, which will
serve a number of different
functions for the communi-
ty, will hopefully replace the
two youth centers which are
at present operating sepa-
rately.

The college YMCA and
the Davidson Presbyterian
Church are assisting the
Community Relations Coun-
cil in establishing and main-
’ taining the center.

Presently, the ORC plans
for the center to include a.
vocational information’ cen-
ter, a college counseling
service, STEP, tutorial of-
fices, and a meeting hall
for organizations of the
young people of the town.

According to. sources on
the CRC, one of the goals
of the proposed youth cen-
ter would be to’°bring the
youths from the -black and
white sections of the town
together in a social setting.

Presently the two youth cen-

ters are segregated.

Also, the ORC hopes that
the center would serve to
provide the college students
with an extracampus activi-
ty, and a chance to become
involved in the life of the
Davidson community.
