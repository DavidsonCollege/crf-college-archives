process of determining the intent of the ac-
cused. The changes are helpful, according to
Parker, because “how.can we tell intent, and
to what extent does intent translate into guilt?”
In other words, the new wording would not
excuse egregious examples of plagiarism, no
matter the intent.

The new definitions attempt to say that, no
matter what the accused’ s intent, certain cases
— that is, those that include “unreasonable
negligence” — are clear cases of plagiarism.

For example, under the current system, a
student could steal a chapter from a Tom
Wolfe book in an attempt to impress his
teacher with his intelligent social criticism. If
that teacher elects to prosecute him, it could
be hard to convict. The student could testify
that he did not intend to plagiarize — indeed,
he could say that it was simply an honest
mistake.

Though there is no mention in the Honor
Code about whether the Honor Council is to
judge with intent in mind, it admittedly would
be hard to convict a student if he insists he did
not know what he was doing.

If the system is modified as suggested, the
student could insist that he did not intend to
copy from Tom Wolfe, but the Honor Coun-
cil would be required to convict him. Cer-
tainly, stealing an entire chapter from any
work would most certainly qualify as an act
of “unreasonable negligence.”

Of course, it will always be up to the Honor

Council to decide what constitutes “unrea-
sonable negligence,” just as it is currently
their prerogative to decide to. what degree
intent matters.

The current proposal seems to have spiked
the faculty coffeemaker with some strong
opinions. Electronic mail discussions among
faculty members have reached dizzying pro-
portions.

“All faculty,” explained Dr. Sally
McMillen, professor of history, ”are recog-

nizing the need to be vigilant about plagia-

rism” — and consequently, they are taking a
very active role in campus discussions on this
issue.

Perhaps the most contentious point with

the wording of the proposal is the whole
concept of “unreasonable negligence.” Dr.
Susan Roberts, a professor of political sci-
ence, stated: “Many faculty are, and students
should be, perplexed as to what is meant by
‘unreasonable negligence.’ Does that imply
ascertaining what is and what is not “reason-
able negligence?’” Indeed, such questions
will be addressed at the meeting tomorrow.
This year could be a very important year
for the Honor Code, because, according to
Parker, other issues could be up for discus-
sion. “In the future we will wrestle over what
‘unreasonable’ means,” he predicted:
Further, the unrelated issue of what consti-
tutes the “counsel” that is allowed. during

“Cheating includes plagiarism, whichis repre-

Four public forums concerning the Honor
Code are scheduled for this year,

The forum tomorrow is the first time that
students will be asked for input on the issue of
plagiarism.

This year’s Honor Council leadership feels
strongly that students should be included,
because, in Anderson’s words, the Honor
Code “belongs to all students .-. . For a long
time, these debates circled about Honor Coun-
cil meetings, faculty meetings, and casual
conversations all around campus. With this
new process, we’re seeking to channel all
those opinions into a coherent, policy-formu-
lating process.”

Even though the future look of the Honor
Code is murky at this point, it is quite clear
that the faculty is divided on the issue. Phil
Reed ’02, member of the Honor Council,
stated: “That there is disagreement among
the faculty about this issue should be without
doubt.”

In Reed’s opinion, the current proposal for
a revised Honor Code is an amendment that
seeks to “reconcile all of the faculty.” He said
that it “should not be surprising... that our
solution is disputable.”

The public forums are designed to allow
for student input as well, which, in reality,
could swing campus momentum one way or
the other.

Any change would be made in the hope that

‘the Honor Code will be both more fair and

more effective in its everyday but profound
use at Davidson College.

of the groups were granted the house. Al-
though CCRL, the advisory committee to
President Vagt, gave DIA its approval for the
house, Vagt was unsure if DIA had a proven
need for the house.

Vagt said that he wanted to “respect the
things DIA wants to do, while acknowledg-
ing that these things haven’t been done yet,”
but hopes and believes that DIA will need and
use the house frequently.

In the meantime, anyone can book the
house for events. When asked what the plans
for the Outpost are for the year, William
Brown, the Director of the Union, said, “I
understand that DIA is going to use the Out-
post heavily — but it is available to other
groups.”

DIA has, in the meantime, booked the
Outpost for most of the semester and plans to
use the house as much as possible. DIA
president Carlos Carreras ‘01 commented,
“The Outpost has long been an important
activities center for DIA, and now that we

have it three nights a week we intend, among
others, to offer an interesting social alterna-
tive to the campus, an alternative guided by a
spirit of commitment to international aware-
ness.”

As of last week, the Outpost food is avail-
able in the Union Café.
(And yes, the

who once worked for the Outpost, reflected,
“Like most students, I wish the Outpost was
stillhere. There’ s something about dim lights,
overpriced. quesadillas and a room over-
crowded with restless partygoers. The Union
Café doesn’ thave this atmosphere—it doesn’t
even serve grill items past
11pm.”

quesadillas are avail-
able now.) The café is
open the same hours
that the Outpost used
to keep for four nights
a week, although the
grill closes a half hour
earlier.

Fears that the Out-
post would not be as

here.

There is also the feel-
ing that the Union doesn’t
provide the same post-
party atmosphere as the
Outpost. Some students
believe the bright lights
and underlying presence
of the administration dis-
suade people from going

successful in the Union
were dispelled last
weekend. The café was crowded until very
late, reported William Brown, although the
atmosphere was noticeably quieter than the
Outpost used to be.

Student opinion still favors the Outpost
remaining a late-night café. Charles Lea ‘03,

party.

Many students still
hold the hope that the Outpost might be
brought back at the end of the year, but as of
now, the building will play host to DIA and
other organizations in need of a friendly,
inclusive place to hold events. Whether this
arrangement is permanent remains to be seen.

she expects these interests to change—espe-
cially given that the top two choices were
Biology and Pre-Med.

The new freshman class has.an interesting
mix of students. There is the professional
actress and the award-winning photographer,
the blues singer who is also the only woman
on the Ultimate Ski Team in Vermont, the
football player who doubles as a
Shakespearian actor, the weaver, the African
drummer, and the official English bell-ringer.
And, of course, the student with the tattoo of
a Celtic Wildcat.

Over half the class lettered in or played a
varsity sport, and most of the class did some
sort of volunteer work. Over half of the new
freshmen have gone abroad for mission work.

So, welcome Class of 2005! Enjoy your
‘mosttalented’ status while it lasts—the class
of 2006 will be here soon enough.

Davidson College,
are you ready?

The Peace Corps will be on campus this
September. Come to the information session
to learn about the international opportunities
available to Volunteers and how YOU can
begin the toughest job you'll ever love.
