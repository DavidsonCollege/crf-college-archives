_ Nilson 's Policies A Result
’ Of Christian Beliefs--Link

Exploring the relation be.
tween Woodrow Wilson's
Christian faith and his poli-
tices, historian Arthur S.
Link yesterday described
much of Wilson's progressiv.
ism and foreign policy as a
development from the Presi-
dent’s Presbyterian and Cal.
vinist backgrounds.

As Wilson‘s religious be-
liefs moved from the rather
stern Calvinistic pietism to
which he had been exposed
in his family and at David-
son and Princeton, the Presi
dent's political beliefs fol-
lowed.

In 1906, Link said. Wilson
was maintaining ‘Christ was
not a social reformer.”

But by 1916. Wilson was
saying it) was more impor-
tant to save society than the
individual. It was also in the
1916 campaign that Wilson
advocated programs that
were “nothing less than a
vision ofthe modern welfare
state,” said Link, for in that
year Wilson for the first time
began viewing the govern-
ment’s role as one of pro
tecting the underprivileged.

Link is writing a definitive
biography of Woodrow Wil-
son. A professor at Prince-
ton University, he was de-
scribed in his introduction as
a ‘‘dyed in the wool Demo-
crat.”

Wilson was one of the few
politicians, said Link, whose
political beliefs followed his

religious beliefs. However, in
a question and answer peri-
od after his address, Link
said Wilson would not be list-
ed as a fanatic. ‘‘He had a
tendency. but he tried fo
keep it under control...
He always had a self-critical
capacity, even when he was
a boy.”

Link also rejected the the-
sis that Wilson was rigid and
inflexible, citing numerous
legislative compromises the
President made during his
first term (1913-17). The his-
torian attributed Wilson's un.
bending attitude on the ratif-

ication of the League of Na-
tions Covenant to the Presi-
dent's stroke and subsequent
isolation.

Wilson's strong moral up
bringing left him a man “in
capable not only of outright
corruption but of subtle cor-
ruption when he knew strings
were attached.” said Link.

He at one time risked the
Democratic nomination by
telling William Randolph
Hearst, one of the famous
yellow journalists, to ‘go to
hell” when Hearst offered
Wiison his support.

Insurance Plans
Get Investigation

By JOE SMITH
Staff Writer

Davidson's fraternities are
considering the purchase of
insurance for their house em-
ployees. According to Assist
ant Dean of Students James:
J. Terry Jr., the project is
still in the planning stage.

Approached by housemoth-
ers on the subject of improv-
ed compensation for fraterni-
ty personnel, Terry said he
did. some preliminary study
on the matter himself. He
then consulted the 12 frater-
nity treasurers, who will
make the final decision on
what insurance plan, if any,
will be used.

The final decision will not
be made, however, until all
bids have been received.

Hood
Norton
Dies

Hood Norton. who owned
Norton's Barber Shop on
Main Street, died Monday
night in Charlotte after a se-
vere cerebral hemorrhage.

Norton. who was 73, had
operated the shop for over
half a century. His son Ken-
neth Norton was a partner
in the operation.

Services were yesterday
afternoon at Greenville Tab-
ernacle AME Zion Church,
of which he had been a
member.

Terry said. After the bids
have been received, the com.
mittee will choose from four
or five plans, he said.

‘The plans themselves vary
in cost, but more important-
ly, they vary in payment
procedure, Terry said. Most
plans require that all 12
houses take out policies, to
ensure that the best rates.
can be obtained. One of the
plans makes it possible for
the fraternities to pay indi-
vidually, thus giving each
house the’ option on. taking
out the insurance.

The policies would be tak-
en out for housemothers and
kitchen staff, said Terry.
They include life insurance.
accidental death or dismem-
berment coverage. weekly
disability payments for acci-
dents and sickness, hospital-
ization, and other medical
benefits.

“Costs are not prohibitive,”
Terry said, “‘but the costs
are there.'’ He went on to
point out that the expense of
the plan was a _ problem
which each house would have
to face.

Both Terry and Intefrater.
nity Council President Bobby
Vagt agreed that the insur-
ance plan could be a big step
toward solving one of the
biggest problems on Patter
son Court. the shortage of
house help. ‘“‘We need in
creased benefits.’ said Vagt.
“to keep the people we have
now and to attract others.,
This program would be a
good start.”

Student Complaints Yield Dividends;
Slater Promises Improved Services

Student dissatisfaction with
Slater Food Service in the.
College Union cafeteria has
brought about a Slater prom-
ise to improve the service.

Business Manager Robert
A. Currie, in response to stu-
dent protests about the food
service. wrote a letter to
Clarence E. Koester. Slater
vice president, threatening to
terminate Davidson's, con-
tract with Slater unless food
service was.improved.

Koester wrote back prom
ising a study group and re-
forms in the service.

Klaus Kleeberg, Slater res-
ident manager, has already
instituted several new serv.

a guide and as a consolation
for Wilson. He felt he was al-
ways under a God of majes-
ty and sovereignty, the Lord
of history and nations as well
as individuals. And it was in

reading The Bible that the.

dejected President found con-
solation after the Senate‘s
second defeat of the League
Covenant.

Wilson hated war passion-
ately, said Link. Although not
a pacifist, Wilson may have
questioned the long-standing
Christian idea of the ‘‘just
war.”’ The President consid-
ered aggressive war as noth-
ing less than ‘organized
murder,” and “burned with
shame” at the thought of the
United States’ involvement
in the Mexican War.

When the United States fi.
nally entered World War 1,
it was because Wilson had
decided that American entry
was the only way to end the
war. The nation had remain
ed neutral as long as pos-
sible in order to play the role
of mediator, as Wilson saw
it.

The United States had a
mission to the world in Wil-
son's eyes. Foreign policy
was not to be used for ma-
terial aggrandizement, but
“to fulfill God's mission to
mankind,”

America was to be God's
redemptive force on earth,
aiding the spread of democ-
racy and Christianity. Dur.
ing the question and answer
period Link compared some
of Wilson's statements to
those of the late President
John F. Kennedy in their
high moral tone.

Heyward Turns
Draft Card In

By DICK ANDERSON

Asst. Managing Editor:

“IT couldn't just hide be-
hind my 4-D deferment, so I
turned in my draft card."

That was the gist of what
Nat Heyward, ‘68, had to say
about why he turned in his
draft card last November.
Heyward, a leader of the stu-
dent group working for the
integration of Johnson's Bar-
bershop last year, is present-
ly attending San Francisco
Theological Seminary in San
Anselmo, Calif.. and had a
4.D, ministerial deferment.

“I don't really know if I'll
be prosecuted or not.’’ Hey-
ward said from California in
a telephone interview. ‘In
fact, the government has
kind of undercut the signifi-
cance of my action because
the Supreme Court has ruled
that ministerial students are
not subject to the Selective
Service."

Heyward said that he did
expect to leave the seminary
to work in the black com-
munity of Palo Alto. near
the seminary, and that this
might make him subject to
prosecution. ‘

“The fact that I had a 4-D
meant that I didn't have to
deal with the Selective Serv-
ice,’ Heyward said, “and I
decided to apply for consci-
entious objector status.

“But when I realized that
CO status is exclusively for
educated. affluent, white per-
sons who can talk the draft
boards around, I began to
have more and more person-
al upheaval, and finally
about a thousand of us had
a candlelight ceremony in
which we turned in our cards
together.”

Tapes, Tape Decks Stolen

From Cars In Campus Lots

There were a number of
stereo tape robberies on cam.
pus parking lots during the
months of November and De
cember.

In early November tapes
and a tape deck were stolen
from the car of junior John-
ny Lientz. The car was park-
ed in the fraternity court at
the time.

A car belonging to junior
George Johnson was parked
next to Belk Dormitory when
seven tapes were taken from
it before Thanksgiving.

A forced entry was made
into the locked car of senior
Frank Spence through a win
dow in early December. The
car was in the parking lot
behind East Dormitory.

On Dec. 7 tapes, a tape
deck, the rear speaker, and
the gear-shift knob were stol-
en from the car of senior
Tom Phillips while it was
parked behind Little Dormi-
tory.

In addition to tape thefts,
students reported thefts in
Watts and Little dormitories

last Sunday. Senior Sam Da-
vis said a radio, a sterco,
two electric shavers, two suit
cases and two jackets were
taken from his room on first
floor Watts. An overcoat and
a stereo were reported miss
ing from first floor Little.

A student reported that he
saw two people carrying ob-
jects out of Little Sunday
night and followed them to a
ear. He said he has given
both a description of the car
and a partial license number
to the Davidson police.

Heyward hopes. to become
a minister of some kind. but
plans not to go straight
through seminary. Instead he
will participate in social ac-
tion programs.

San Francisco Theological

terian school approximately

Foundation had made the
grant toward the new multi-
million dollar library. The
other grant, representing
$1,500 from the Shell Com-
panies Foundation, was an-
nounced last Monday.

The Frueauff gift will help
the college meet a challenge
grant of $500,000 by Edward
H. Little of New York, a
longtime benefactor of Da-
vidson, on the condition that
the college raise $1.500,000 in
matching funds for a new li.
brary, Spencer said.

“We deeply appreciate. this
gift from the Frueauff Foun-
dation, which comes through
the interest of Mr. Harry
Frueauff of Tallahassee.
Fla.,”"* he said. ‘The new li-
brary is the number one item
on our priority list. We must
construct a building adequate
for the long range future.”

The Frueauff Foundation
specializes in grants for

health programs and for col-
lege buildings and equip-
ment, according to a founda-
tion spokesman.

Davidson hopes to begin
construction on the library in
1970.

The college has received a
Shell grant every year since
the assist program was start-
ed in 1958. This year the.
grant came in three equal
parts of $500 each.

Grant No, 1 is for any in-
stitutional use which the
president determines. Grant
No. 2, for professional devel.
opment of faculty members.
will be administered by Dean
of Faculty Frontis W. John-
ston.

Grant No. 3 ‘‘for additional
professional development of
individual members of the
physics faculty.” will be su-
pervised by Dr. John Hop-
kins, chairman of the Phys.
ics Department.
