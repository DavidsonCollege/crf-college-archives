Intelligent Wives

Seen as Necessi

“Marry a woman who knows
more than you do” is the advice giv-
en to college students by Warren
Bruner, management consultant
who is ‘conducting an experimental
course in career determination at
Marietta College.

“A man’s personality and mental
stature tend to increase as he pro-
gresses in his occupational field,”
he told his class recently. “On the
other hand, a woman starts going
backward as soon as she enters a
career as a homemaker — unless
she realizes the danger and fights
hard against it.

“Educate her less than the man,
or start them even, and you pro-
vide one of several causes for the
case of a man in middle life divorc-
ing the partner of his carly strug.
gles to seek a more compatible
mate.” | :

Marriage as a career is one of
many fields considered by Bruner
in his course. The course is intend-
ed, he said, to “tead to a wise choice
of specific careers by exposing stu-
dents to .comparable information
about—a-sumber of career fields.”

“Ag far as is known,’ Bruner
continued, “Marietta College is one
of the few liberal arts colleges in
which life planning is considered as
important as delving into literature,
history, art, or other subjects car-
ried in most curricula. At least, it's
the only one that offers courses in
career determination which — stu-
dents may clect for credit.”

These courses are the heart of a
program of life planning, Bruner
said. But he betieves a college’s
obligations to students and society
are not fully discharged until the
courses are supplemented by indi.
vidual career counseling and an ef:
fective placement service.

“A number of othercolleges,” he
said, “are watching the experiment
here with considerable interest.
Many people think the time is not
far distant when all colleges will be
compelled by popular demand to of-
fer instruction of this type.”

other interesting fact regarding the
“average American boy,” namely,
that age 16 is the time when he be-

When America’s students play,
the survey showed, they have pret-

choice of sports. Fishing is more

leads the other two sports by a
wide margin among co-eds. But
whether it is tennis, golf or fishing,
and whether a young sportsman or
sportswoman is involved, the sur-
vey indicated that makers’ brand
names are still first choice as guides
in buying equipment.

ln other fields surveyed, the ex- |,
tent and power of student purchas-
ing was equally evident. In record
players and recordings, findings
showed that 85.5 per cent of the
students interviewed were regular
buyers of records and that the pop-
warity of recordings was high in
all age groups from 14 to 26 years
of age. ;

In motor products, the Founda-
lion study showed that 3 out of 4
of the male students interviewed
own or have access to automobiles.
Tabulations revealed that 76.1 per
cent of the boys and young men
interviewed buy gasoline and
that both boys and girls are buy-
ers of the tires, oil- and other pro-
ducts used to maintain automo-
biles in good running order. In
other sections of the study, results
demonstrated that the greatest pro-
portions of students consider mak-
ers’ brand names as the most re-
lighle guides in their purchases of
watches, personal jewelry, candy
and when buying gifts.

The Wey West, by A. B, Gu-
thrie, Jr., is perhaps even better than
his The Big Sky, often termed
the best story of the prairie schoon.
er days of the West ever written.
It is the tale of a fleet of prairie
schooners making their way from
Independence, Mo., to Oregon, and
the story of the lives of the people,
their problems and their triumphs,
in that fleet.

Nineteen Eighty-Four is 2 bril-
liant, biting satire on the horrors
of totalitarianism, in whatever form
it may come. George Orwell has
shown keenness and prophetic pow-

popular magazines, for its timeli.
ness and force.

Point of No Return, by John P.
Marquand, has had just as much no-
tice from the press and the general
public as Nineteen Eighty-Four if
not more. Point of No Return is a
satirical novel on American middle
class life. Full of wry humor, the
book describes some decisive days
in the life of Charles Gray, a New
York banker, who must take his
choice between social position and
money.

Billie Burke’s With a Feather on
My Nose is a humorous and de.

mental faculties.
