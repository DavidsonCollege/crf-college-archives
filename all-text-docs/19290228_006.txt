* Answer Is Affirmative

“Do Men Follow

Women in Styles?”

He-men collegians wear striped pa-
jamas in the privacy of their frater-
nity houses because Peggy Joyce or
somebody wore ’em ‘publicly at the
Lido last summer. And Joe College,
’29, will adorn himself in fancy silken
velvet vests and lounging robes be-
cause Paul Pioret dressed a couple
of his models in the same material
for a stroll down the Rue de la Paix.
Such are at least well justified con-
clusions if we take at face value the
startling statements of Gaston J. Du-
cerf, European style scout for leading
American haberdashers, as published
in the February issue of the “Concen-
trator,” men’s wear organ of a Chi-
cago manufacturing firm.

Says Mr. Ducerf, “When called on
to answer the question, “Do men fol-
low women in styles?” there is no
necessity for using diplomatic lan-
guage to get around the question.

From a careful survey of not only
the best men’s wear shops but also the

“most fashionable couturiers of the Rue
de la Paix during the past few months,
the answer must be in the affirma-
tive.”

Mr. Ducerf, probably not thinking
of the irritation he would cause harm-
lessly masculine minded students’ of
the U. S. A., makes out a very good

for himself. “The trend,” he

continues, “was noticeable away last
summer at the most fashionable sea-
side places when men started to use
elaborate and fancy bathing suits in
bright colors similar to those displayed
by film and stage stars. This was also
true of robes; very little difference
being noticeable between the extrava-

case

more refined articles by the
women.

“During the recent fall and winter
season sport season the best dress-
makers in Paris turned out many
Ensembles in knitted pullover sweaters
and dresses of futuristic patterns. This
has been’ immediately reproducéd: in
articles recently by the most fashion-
able haberdashers in: men’s pullovers,
golf hose, cardingans, etc. Under the
name “poloblends” I predict that one
such article will meet with wide ap-
proval this spring and summer for
American sports.”

But the trend is not one of imita-
tion, but rather adoption of the best,
Mr. Ducerf hastens to explain (to
keep men in good temper, probably).
He says that all men are learning to
dress for their own sake rather than
for the sake of their clothes. ‘Men
are learning to buy their haberdashery
in Ensemble to blend and harmonize
with their other clothing. It is that by
which we may account for the present
trend. You must not mistake me—
men are taking nothing that is ereiticy
inate from the ladies.

“Rather, women being recognized
as such experts in harmonizing col-
quite a few manufacturers con-
fining t their, production to men’s wear
are AYding it to their advantage to
watch the latest productions of the
Champs Elysees.”

Mr. Ducerf has just completed a
special study of the smarter places
Where the society of two continents
meet and the most fashionable styles
are displayed. He has been inter-
preting the trend in men’s wear for

him almost every day. Some day, I
believe T will actually see him in per-
and when T do, then T can tell
more about my ideal man.

The way he looks in all my day
dreams, he has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde personality. He must be able
to change at will in conformance with
my moods. He must be a gentleman,
preferably the Roosevelt
type of gentleman.

headed. His eyes, also are immaterial,
just so he can see out of them, and look

He must have two things principally
—ambition, and a good disposition. No
matter what he is when I first see him
in my dreams, no matter how far ad-
vanced, popular, or how
plished he is, he must have a driving
power to advance farther, and do
more. As to his disposition, my ideal
man must not let little things bother
him, but it is all right for him to be
stern and commanding on the big
things.

As to scholarship, I can’t imagine
my own ideal being a scholar, unless
he is that way without being a book-
worm. If he is, so much the better,
but I shouldn't care if he never made
higher than a “B” average. The best
scholastic quality I can imagine in him
is that he has ability to wriggle a “B”
out of a “C plus” grade.

One of the most essential qualities
of my ideal man is that he must be
likeable to other men. If he is .ex-
tremely popular with women, I'd be
rather afraid to risk him. If the other
men whom he knows like him, that’s
his recommendation to me.

Y. M.C. A. Basketeers

Conquer Lincolnton

In a rather slow game, the Davidson

Y. M. C. A. basketeers succeeded in

downing the Lincolnton All Stars by

| a 19-8 count. This was the first win

of the season for the local aggre-
gation.

Featuring the second half was the
close guarding of the “Y” guards who
prevented the All Stars from scoring
a single point in this period. McGa-
vock was high scorer for the evening
with seven markers. Combs of Lin-
colnton ranking second with four.

The “Y” team showed a marked
imprpvement in its attack, which was
more effective than in any previous
game.

Lineups for the two teams follow:
For Lincolnton, Cook, center; Combs,
Baxter, Shuford; Love, McCutchen,
and Cornwell; for the “Y” Overman,

Gilmore, center; McGavock, — Miller,

I must go down to the dean again, to
the tyrant lord in his den,

And all I ask is a good line and a drag
to help me then.

But my long face, and my sob song,
and my beer-suit quaking

Tell a sad tale of my weak heart and
my poor knees shaking.

I must go down to the dean again, to
take my stand on the mat,

For a note came and a call came, and
there’s no denying that;

And all I ask is a good break and the
dean’s mood joyous, ’

And a good chance for a nice chat
with none to annoy us.

I must go down to the dean again to
give him a new excuse,

To the dark room, to the black room,
to the torture rack and the noose;
And all I ask is half a chance to spill

And then a date with a nice girl to

respects. better than the old Armory,
since it is steam-heated, will offer more
room, and will afford a rifle gallery.

Another point. decided upon by the
board of trustees was that a careful
study should be made of the medical care
of the students with a view to improv-
ing and making more complete the medi-
cal and infirmary service.

A nominating committee headed by Dr.
Walter L. Lingle, of Richmond, Va.,
chairman of the board, was designated
to make recommendations at the June
meeting for the next President of David-

son. Associated with Dr. Lingle in these
deliberations will be Smith Richardson,
of Greensboro; Dr. Byron Clark, of

Salisbury ; Dr. Hamilton W. McKay, of
Charlotte; Dr. R. H. McCaslin, of Jack-
sonville, Fla.; Dr. Neal L. Anderson, of

Savannah, Ga.; and S. Clay Williams of
Winston-Salem.
Profs. E. A. Beaty, J. H. Davis, Jr.,

and W. P. Cummings, who have been
acting as assistant professors, were ele-
vated by the board to associate profes-
sorships. This election also carried with
it an increase in salary, and the salaries
of a number of the other ale) Bel were
increased.

A year’s leave of absence was granted
to Profs. Fred L. Blythe and A. C. Gore,
for advanced study, Dr. M. E. Sentelle,
dean, was also granted a leave of ab-
sence in order to sail on May 13 for
Palestine and other points.

Dr. C. R. Harding and Dr. W.
Grey, who have been automatically re-
tired under the annuity plan at Davidson,
were both re-elected for another year.

of interest were shown among. which were

views of the Alpine peaks and a picture
of the decapitulated statue of St, Luke

The theme of his talk, Dr. Anderson
stated, would, be the idea gotten from the
passage in Isaiah which said “You shall
mount up like the eagles with wings.”

When flying for the first time things
took on an entirely new aspect and ap-
pearance. The landscape seen as a whole
seemed almost perfectly symmetrical and
thus might we profit by looking at one
another and the affairs and probelms of
life from the eagle's perspective if we
could only bring ourselves to do this.
Day by day the world becomes smaller
and, as time and not space becomes the
measure of the earth, we are brought
closer and closer together with one anoth-
er throughout the whole world. Thus it
becomes vitally important that people
everywhere begin to understand each
other more. sie

Here Dr. Anderson described one
phase of his flight through the Alps from
Venice to Rome. The plane was about
two miles high and there were clouds
of the purest snow twenty and _ thirty
thousand feet high, surrounding them.
Coming out of these the passengers got
their first glimpse of the blue Adriatic
and thus might we get a glimpse of the
glorious eternity if only took the.
eagle’s perspective.

Store.

But there are limitations to the eagle’s
perspective. The limit of the sky for
the physical flight is about 42,000 feet
which is an extremely small distance as
compared with the rest of the earth. So
when the time soon comes that men will
reach the limitations of all things phy-
sical then will be the day there shall be
mental, spiritual and intellectual flight.
Thus the limitations of the eagle and
birdman are not for the soul also.

Then Dr. Anderson spoke of the hom-
ing instinct of the eagle. The secret of
the success of the greatest of birdmen,
Lindbergh, is due partly at least to his
homing instinct. No scientific achieve-
ment can answer the question that man
everywhere is continually asking himself
—whither am I going? This s to be ans-
wered by the spiritual and not the phy-
sical being of man.

and yet not be able to pass the re-
quired tests for entrance into the fra-
ternity.

The fraternity is a goal to be reached
by all-around athletics. To pass the
required tests, a man must work long
enough to become proficient in the
technique and knack of doing the dif-
ferent requirements, and he must also
have enough stamina to stand the
tests.

Another feature of the fraternity
is the fact that.a varsity letter may
be substituted for any one event ex-
cept swimming. However, if the man
is a two or three letter man, he may
only use one of his letters for this
purpose. The following is a part of
the constitution of the fraternity.

The following requirements must
met before any college will be
considered a member of the society.

be

At least three students from the col-
lege must satisfy the full requirements.

a. No student shall be admitted to
membership who is found deliquent in
scholarship.

b. The candidate must, command
the respect of his associates as an
athlete and a gentleman.

c. The committee on certification
from each college shall be elected by
the faculty and shall sign each certi-
ficate of membership. At least one
faculty representative must be present
when the trials are being conducted.
The officers of any college chapter
shall include the President of the col-
lege, and five faculty members, one
of whom shall be the director of Physi-
cal Education.

Physical Requirements

1. Sprint 100 yards in 11:3-5ths
seconds.

2. Run the 220-yard low hurdles in
31 seconds, leaving all hurdles stand-
ing.

3. High Jump 5 feet.

4. Broad Jump 17 feet.

5. Shot Putt (16 lb. Shot) 30 feet
for men weighing 160 lbs. or over.
This requirement is to be scaled down
in accordance with the proportion—
160 Ibs. is to candidatt’s weight, as 30

ft. is to requirement.
6. Pole Vault 8 ft. 6 inches.
7. Baseball Throw, 250 feet on fly.
8. Punting Football 120 feet on fly.
9. Swim 100 yards in two minutes.
