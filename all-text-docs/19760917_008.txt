‘Booters expect strong year,
Stone credits solid defense

By TED JONES

As the 1976 Davidson Col-
lege soccer season approaches,
Coach Chip Stone feels a
combination of hard work,
team unity, and concentration
should bring the Wildcat
soccer squad a successful sea-
son.

‘‘We should be a stronger
team despite the great losses
to graduation,’’ said Stone.
‘‘We’ve got a good group of
freshmen — adds a lot to the
team. The upperclassmen
really enjoy them.”

With co-captain Paul Par-
ker, Dave Herrington, Joel
Shirk and freshman Kevin
Robbins as backs, Stone feels
the team will be better defen-
sively. He also added that the
team has ‘‘a whole crew of
capable goalkeéperes’’ such as
last year’s starter, Bob Perz,
and freshman Doug Schues-
sler.

Offensively, ‘‘It’s too early
to tell, though Dave Patton
should be strong as a striker.

We will be depending on hima .

lot,’”’ said Stone.

\At midfield, Stone is high
on D.C. Augustine and co-
captain Gordari Maner. ‘‘They

really work hard. They should |

be a real asset both offensively
and defensively ,’’ he said.

The Davidson soccer season.
begins September 15th ag-
ainst: Guilford at Greensboro.

“Guilford is a very strong
team,’’ said Stone. ‘‘they tied
North Carolina 3-3 recently,
North Carolina being about
the toughest team we will
play. We will have to play real
well to win. It will take a real
good effort on everyone’s part,
with no mental lapses. If we
do I think we will surprise a lot
of people this year.”’

Stone also mentioned a sch-
edule change for the team’s
first home game. The Wildcats
will play the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte on
October 6.

The team has been practic-
ing since September 1. Start-
ing at 7 am they had three
practices a day this summer
running, ball handling, pas-
sing, juggling, and shooting,
with Stone’s goal to have the
team in the best shape poss-
ible.

The Wildcats participated
in the High Point Classic
pre-season tournament on Se-
ptember 10 and 11, and,
although losing both games,

the second a heart-breaking
2-1 loss in double overtine to
High Point, it was a good
tune-up and the team learned
a lot from their mistakes.

Stone treated the games as
scrimmages, and all the play-
ers got plenty of action.

Upperclassmen returning to

the absence of one of David-

the University of Missouri to
finish out his collegiate
basketball career.

Dore, who averaged 8.4

_ points and 5.0 rebounds a

game last season for the
Wildcats, stated that an
interest in playing closer to his
Franklin Park, Ill. home was
the main reason for the
transfer.

“I think Tommy will be
happier closer to home,’’
commented Coach Dave
Pritchett. ‘‘He is very close to
his family.”’ Pritchett also said
the year of eligibility all
transfer students lose would
help Dore.

Pritchett said that Dore had
inquired into the possibility of
being red-shirted for his
sophomore year. He had some
confidence problems concern-
ing his ability, and the
pressure that would focus oh
him as Davidson strived to
improve its faltering basket-
ball program.

The chance to play close to
home and also sit out a year
sent Dore to Missouri.

Of course Pritchett was
upset with losing the giant
center, who was to be an
integral part of the Wildcat’s
future plans.

According to him the
rumored friction between him
and Dore did not exist.

He talked extensively with

. Tom.this summer about the

transfer and he understood
Tom’s decision.

“The team has adjusted well
to Tom’s leaving and I’m

looking forward to the
upcoming season,’’ said
Pritchett.

“The Board of Trustees and
President Spencer have made
a strong committment to
putting Davidson basketball
back into national promi-
nence,”’ Pritchett said. ‘I am
confident that this goal can be
reached in the years to
come.
