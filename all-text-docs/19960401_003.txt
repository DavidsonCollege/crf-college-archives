Davidson pond, located just
off I-77 at Griffin Street beside
the entrance to.the town, will be
cleaned up and improved by the
town of Davidson. According to
the March 20th issue of The Char-
lotte Observer, town commission-
ers have set aside $25,000 for
construction drawings, and the
question facing Davidson Parks
and Recreation now is how to

Many Davidson residents
have complained about the pond,

water primrose growing there and:
that the area surrounding the pond
did not have enough benches,

The Charlotte Observer says

Davidson Parks and Recreation
plans to alter the pond area in
phases, and a public meeting will
be held before each construction
phase to obtain public opinions on
the project: “The first phase of
improvements, which will cost
about $200, 000, will include drain-
ing, drying and dredging the pond
and installing walls to trap debris
from tributaries and storm drains.”

Jennifer Schuetz, a senior Cen-
ter major in environmental analy-
sis, wrote her thesis on the pond
and conducted a survey of 150
households in order to find out
what Davidson residents would like
to see happen to the pond.

Her survey results showed a
socioeconomic and racial split in
opinions. Most of the African-
Americans surveyed preferred to
see the pond converted to a park
area, while the opinions of Cauca-

sian residents were split between
maintaining the pond as a natural
habitat and utilizing the pond for
a recreational area.

According to Schuetz, if
Davidson Parks and Recreation
deepens the pond, it will destroy
the aquatic habitat for the prim-
rose, which grows in very shal-
low water. Schuetz does not rec-
ommend deepening the pond be-
cause the temporary displacement
of the plants and animals living in
the pond would disrupt the pond’s
function as a natural habitat.

Schuetz says, “I suggest leav-
ing the aquatic habitat alone and
adding recreational facilities on
the land so more people can enjoy
the pond. The pond could be used
as an educational resource to learn
about water quality and the dif-
ferent plants and animals which
live there.”

for library acquisitions as well as
deferred maintenance.

Since The Endowment’s cre-
ation in 1924, it has given almost
$49 million to Davidson College.
Its assets are currently worth over

$1.5 billion.

Davidson receives money
from the endowment along with
three other colleges in the Caroli-
nas.

President John Kuykendall
feels grateful for the annual fund-
ing: “Davidson’s relationship with
The Duke Endowment continues
to flourish and is essential to the
well-being of the institution.”

will be offered across the curricu-
lum. Abernathy says that “basi-
cally what we’re asking faculty to
pass is an option for departments
to have minors.”

If the proposal is passed by the
faculty, minors are expected to be

instituted by “smaller departments
that are more interest oriented...
hopefully, then minors will catch
on [in other departments],”
Abernathy says.

The Council on Academic Af-
fairs will distribute green ribbons
to be worn Monday and Tuesday

in support of minors, and will set —

up an information table in Cham-
bers on Tuesday.

ByCATHERINE ANDERSON
News Editor

The search is over. After a
year-long process of interviews,
the New Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents/Director of Minority Affairs,
Ernest Jeffries, will take on his
new role on June 10. Jeffries is
currently the Assistant to the Vice
Chancellor for Student Develop-
ment and Director of Minority Stu-
dent Affairs at Western Carloina
University. He received a Bach-
elor of Music degree and an M. Ed.
degree in Student Personnel Ser-
vices from the University of South
Carolina.

The search began after former
Assistant Dean of Students, John
Eaves, left in September, bringing
in the first round of candidates for
the open position in late Novem-
ber. The decision was made to
continue the search after Christ-

- mas, and concluded upon Jeffries’

visit in early February. All candi-
dates met with random groups of
students, faculty and staff mem-
bers.

“T think in terms of his com-,
mitment to students, it’s very clear
that he knows its a day and night
job, sohe will live inDavidson. As

well,” says Dean of Students Tom
Shandley.

According to the job descrip-
tion, the Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents “‘serves in the central office

dent Life / Dean of Students. The
Assistant Dean has general respon-
sibilities for providing a variety of
programs and services designed to
insure educational success at
Davidson for the student popula-
tion as a whole and minority stu-
dents in specific.”

Jeffries is looking forward to
the transition. “At this point in
time, I am having a hard time get-
ting over the shock of leaving
[Western Carloina]. But I’m re-
ally excited about working at
Davidson, with the faculty, staff,
and especially the students. When
Icame was thoroughly impressed.
I’mreally looking forward to com-
