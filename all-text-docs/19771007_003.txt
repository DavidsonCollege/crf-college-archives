What do you do when you
don’t know what to do ?

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor
Leslie Jacobs graduated
from Davidson College last
May with a BA in English.
“Now,” she says, “I’m sitting
around drinking beer.”’

This summer she worked as

/ a secretary for her father, a

doctor and trying to find a
more challenging job.

But Ms. Jacobs did not
come to Davidson to learn how
to be a secretary. ‘‘But I don’t
think my education at David-
son was a waste,”’ she said.
“It was wasted, but not a
waste.”

Leslie is one of many in the
’17 graduating class whose

degree is not, as they had
thought, the ticket to a career,
but merely a slip of paper.
And as the Class of 1978
begins its last year in Caro-
lina’s colleges, some of last
year’s graduates are still look-
ing for work.

These are the students who
failed to get into graduate
school, who could not find
work in a tight labor market,
who did not seek out all the
opportunities in their fields.

Mostly, these are the stu-
dents who came out of college
still confused about what to do
with their future. It’s unclear
exactly how many 1977 Caro-
lina’s college graduates have

Trustees arrive ready to face issues

The Trustees of Davidson
College have arrived on cam-
pus and will be discussing
several important matters in
various committees before the
entire Board meets on Friday.

The Executive Committee is
to hear faculty representatives
present an amendment to Par-
agraph 5, Article IV of the
Trustee By-Laws. Efforts to
amend that paragraph began
last spring after the “Christ-
ian Tenure Controversy’’.

Information on the renova-

tion of Martin Science Build-
ing and overall campus deve-
lopment will be presented to
the Building and Grounds
Committee.

That committee may also
initiate efforts to obtain archi-
tectural and land-use planning
services leading to site loca-
tion and working drawings of
a Central Food Service Build-
ing and future housing.

The Student Life and
Health Committee begins its
work with an in-depth discus-

sion of plans for the Dining
Commons and a review of the
status of medical care at the
college.

The Media Board will then
present for approval its re-
cently-drafted Standards for
Publication, and the Commit-
tee will vote on an SGA
recommendation to place the
Patterson Court Council Pres-
ident and the College Union
President on the Council on
Campus and Religious Life.

The Honorary Degrees

Fellows ponders change

By PEG TRAVIS
Staff Writer

The Advisory Board of
North Carolina Fellows (NCF)
is now considering a proposal
which will open the program to
upperclassmen.

The Board met during the
summer to discuss the pro-
posed plan.

‘‘We couldn't resolve the
question at that time,” stated
Professor John Kello, director
of the program. ‘This is
something that we need to
approach slowly.

“We came to the conclusion
that we definitely need to
include upperclassmen, but we
also need to discuss it with
everyone involved.”’

Kello emphasized the im-
portance of including the Fel-
lows in the decision. ‘‘We
don't want to throw a new
system at them and say ‘this
is how- it’s going to be.’ We
need to have their approval.

“The Fellows know what
the Advisory Board is doing
here at every step along the
way. We need to be very
careful because it does repre-
sent something of a change in
policy.”

Although still indefinite,
the proposal calls for upper-
classmen to replace inactive
Fellows who voluntarily sep-
arate themselves from the
program.

It has not yet been deter-
mined how the selection pro-
cess will operate. ‘‘There are

still some logistical problems

to be worked out with taking
on new members,” Kello sta-
ted. Kello intends to meet with
the NCF trustees and at least
one of the other three campus
directors in the next few weeks
to discuss the process.

He will then meet with the
Advisory Board who will fina-
lize the proposal which will
then be discussed among the
Fellows and hopefully ap-
proved.

‘““We’re trying to retine our
statements so that we can get
down to a workable proposal,”’
he concluded.

the same problem as Leslie
Jacobs.

The U.S. Department of
Health, Education and Wel-
fare (HEW) says the latest
statistics it has about unem-
ployed new college graduates
are for the 1975 class. HEW
reports 922,933 degrees gran-
ted in 1974-75 in all 50 states.
North Carolina colleges and
universities granted 23,406;
South Carolina, 10,796.

A 1975 study by Art Padilla
at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-
CH) reports on employment
and job satisfaction for 1974
graduates. More current stu-
dies have not been conducted
to compare 1977’s graduates
with those of 1974.

The 1976 survey found near-
ly 80 percent of the spring
1974 graduates were “‘gainful-
ly employed in the labor
market” 1% years after grad-
uation. This is eight.out of
every ten students.

Fourteen percent of the
class were continuing formal
schooling. The remainder were
involved in some other activ-
ity.

N.C. college administrators
are concerned about the lack of
up-to-date statistics about
their graduates. Representa-
tives from most colleges and
universities in N.C., including
