By KEVIN WHEELOCK

Each member of a new SGA
committee has begun writing
once a month to College Trustee
pen-pal. According to SGA
Senator David Waddill, the
purpose of the student-Trustee

Cook said, ‘I'd live to see him
(Witte) serve some active time.

Cook said it was the first
peeping tom incident reported
this year, but there were several
last year. ‘We urge girls in the
basement to close their blinds,”
he said. :

Richardson residents should
push for more lights in the area
around the dorm, according to
Cook. “‘We've been trying to
get lights up here since before
school started,’’ he explained.

Cook said that campus secur-
ity has improved since the
Campus Police station was set
up two years ago. There are five
sworn-in officers on campus,
who have full police powers,
including authority to arrest.
Plainclothesmen patrol the
campus from 7 pm to 3 am.

less merchandise in thefts since
we've been here,”’ said Cook,
“but we're still trying to edu-
cate them to lock their doors.”’

structure is completed, accord-
ing to Little. If the week-long
workshop is successful, a sec-
ond greenhouse may be built.

Funding for the project, Lit-
tle said, came from a variety of
campus groups, faculty mem-
bers, and students.

‘The Y pledged several hund-
red dollars, and the Recycling
Consortium gave its entire $25
operating budget,” Little said,

**Professors lent tools and
materials and Ken Wood and
Suzie Summers of the office of
Experiential Programs : and
Life/Work Planning coordina-
ted student involvement, while
Sophomore Lynn McClintock
convinced Piedmont Salvage od
Mooresville to donate $40 worth
of lumber.”

Members of Project Light, a
part of Huntersville Commun-
ity Development. Association,
also helped with the work.

“We're somewhat in the red,”
Little added, _“‘and-are- still
soliciting donations.”

The purpose of the week-long
workshop is threefold, accord-
ing to Little. It teaches stud-
ents how to build a low-cost

correspondence is to inform
Trustees about students’ pers-
onal views on College issues.

Waddill, who originated the
committee, said it is composed
of 45 students, so each member
can correspond.with one of the
45 Trustees. He added that the
personal touch of individual
letters should encourage the
Trustees to write back.

The committee will meet once
a month to discuss current
issues and decide on the content

The first letter, written last
week, introduced the students
to the Trustees, and each one
following will express the stud-
ents’ personal convictions on
various issues. Waddill said the
letters will not be form letters,
newsletters, or an expression of,
a consensus of student opinion.
Ther letters are, instead, desig-
ned to express the writers’
personal opinions.

Waddill said that student
response to controversial issues

has often taken the form-of a
flood of letters to the Trustees.
Since Trustees read only a few
such letters, many students’
opinions are never considered.
According to Committee
member John Butler, the mon-
thly letters would provide Trus-
tees with a recognizable source
of student opinion when they
are flooded with mail. Probably,
they would at least read their
student pen-pals’ opinions in
such situations, Butler said.
Committee member Stuart

Dorsett said since most Trust-

ees do not have any sons or
daughters at Davidson, their
main contact with the College is
through the Administration.
The committee can thus help
the Trustees by providing them
with a direct line of contact with
students.

Waddill described student re-
sponse as remarkable.Of the 45
members on the committee only
a few are SGA senators, he
said.
