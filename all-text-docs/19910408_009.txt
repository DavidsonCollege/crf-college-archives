Got The Sniffles?

Think Twice About Medicine

By David Wright

The firstreaction many people
have when they are suffering form
a cold is to reach towards the
medicine cabinet for a bottle of
aspirin or acetaminophen. Al-
though this practice of wanton
medicine groping seems to be
almost instinctual in most of us, it
may not necessarily be a prudent

one. ,
Researchers at the University
of Adelaide in Australia have found
that volunteers infected with acold
virus who took aspirin or acetam-
inophen experienced more of the
uncomfortable symptoms associ-
ated with the cold than those that

were administered the placebo.
In addition, the subjects that

CD Review:

were administered the placebo
developed a higher level of anti-
bodies than those given the drugs.
The researchers concluded that the
use of aspirin or acetaminophen
may actually interfere with the
immune response system and its
attempt to thwart the cold virus,
thus lengthening the period of dis-
comfort.

If you have a cold with the
following symptoms:a runny nose
and sore throat, aspirin or acetam-
inophen will not relieve the con-
gestion and may suppress the
immunological response leading
to resolution of the symptoms.
Consequently, an over-the-counter
decongestantis probably your best
choice. However, if your symp-

toms include severe head and body
aching, the salubrious advantages
of aspirin or acetaminophen seem
to outweigh any of these disadvan-
tages.

In times of need, aspirin or
acetaminophen is a viable option,
but realize that these drugs are not
panaceas and in some cases (such
as arunny nose), they may cause
the discomfort of a cold to worsen.
Remember, the key to relieving
your cold is an understanding of
your symptoms and the effects of
the drug specific treatments.

Is The World Collapsing Around
Our Ears? : REM's Out Of Time

By Will Montgomery and Curt
Perkins

REM’s Out of Time was des-
tined tobecontroversial. Arriving
on the heels of Green places this
record within a grand debate: At
that moment when REM decided
they were“‘too REM” and changed
their sound (and/or approach), what
did they change it to? Why? And
does it work?

Out of Time isa very
good record. On the
album ‘REM. sounds
mostly non-REM being
rather clever about the
entire endeavor. There

these concerns on a global level
beginning with Stipecooly reflect-
ing in a low, quick voice, “The
world collapsed ona Sunday morn-
ing, as creatures jumped the barri-
cades and headed for the sea, sea.”
Stipe hauntingly talks/half-chants,
repeating the encouragement of a
mother to herdaughter to be “calm,
calm,...Belong.” The song cap-
turesamanic, almostdefeated feel-

are many things this al-
bum is not: arock out ex-
travaganza, notMurmur,
and not even consistent
ina“Rock & Roll” sense
of the word.

It is a more subtle
record. It seems that Mi-
chael Stipe has had a
realization: you alienate
people by forcing your
views on them. Instead,
he is almost painfully
self-conscious. In the
song “Losing My Religion,” the
first one given heavy radio airplay
and made into a video seen on the
hour every hour on MTV, he
wonders “have I said too much.”
He is very aware and perhaps un-
comfortable with his role of celeb-
rity/mass-media poet, forced to
choose “‘his confessions” under a
constant spotlight.

This self-consciousness, how-
ever, does not completely censor
Stipe's political commentary. A
sense of paranoia and fear for the
collapse of society pervades the

album. Stipe laments the failure of
commercial radio in “Radio Song”
saying that “the world is collaps-
ing around our ears” and using
radio as ametaphor for popular so-
ciety in general.

The song “Belong” echoes

ing of hopeless collapse, while at
the same time making the simple
affirmation of the human need to
“Belong.”

The strength of Out of Time
lies in its individual songs.
Diehards laud Chronic Town and
Murmur forthesound which REM
captured.

Though thesame janglecreeps
through in songs like “Near Wild
Heaven,” REM has traded the
cohesion ofa “sound” for ahighly
unique attention to each song.
Cohesion, rather, lies in the the-
matic concerns of collapse, mem-
ory, time; and love.

Thereis anoticeably increased
use of instrumentation. In“‘Low”
an eery violin and bass clarinet
moanand whinealong with Stipe’s
ode to melancholy. Jangly man-

dolins and acoustic guitars show up
on some of the more upbeat, bub-
blegum songs like “Shiny Happy
People.” On the instrumental
“Endgame,” a curious step into
gothic elevator music, they use a
fugelhorn. What? Imagine whip-
ping out a fugelhorn in the garage
in Athens.

The album is one of REM’s
strongest achievements. They are
mature artists in their
prime, struggling to break
out of what is expected
while not denying what
they are best at. Each
member of the. band
stretches on this album.
Stipe’s voice is clear,
strong, and intriguing. He
uses obscure lyrics on Out
of Time almost as well as
he has used lyrical incom-
prehensiblity on earlier
albulms. (i.e. Murmur,
etc.). Mike Mills becomes
mr.keyboard, playing both
harpsicord and organ. He
also fronts the vocals on
several songs, proving to
be an interesting, albeit
whiny, change. Bill Berry plays
congas as well as a variety of other
percussion.

Stipe’s mumble days and
REM ’s underwater style are seem-
ingly gone. They were the voice of
the college generation: uncertain
and insecure. With age, the uncer-
tainty has remained, but the con-
cerns are more focused and clearly
stated, Faced with a definite state-
ment, REM’s early interpretive
empathy fans may be turned off.
So much for history.

On Out of Time, REM is more
sure of themselves and their direc-
tion. They have learned to play the
pop game and not sell out. They
don’t fall into the trap of posturing
social messiahs.

album is good.
