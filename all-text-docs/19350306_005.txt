Deputation Of Five Organize
YMCA At Junior College
And High School

A deputation of five was sent to the
Ebenezer Mitchell Junior College and
High School, Misenheimer, N. C., Fri-
day, March 1, for the purpose of es-
tablishing a Y. M. C. A. there. The
deputation consisted of Don Brandon,
A. B. McClure, Harold Ostwalt, Pete
Neill, Ben Rose.

The deputation left Davidson Friday
afternoon and arrived at Misenheimer at
six o'clock. That evening they met with
the forty boys who are students there,
and held a service. The meeting was
opened with scripture by Ben Rose and
prayer by Ostwalt and Neill. A_ talk
was given by Brandon on the “Purpose
of Y. M. C. A. on the College Campus,”
which was followed by a brief open dis-
cussion on the.possibility of establishing
a “Y” at the school. The meeting was
closed with the election of officers for
the new “Y.”

The deputation had charge of the
chapel services of the school the next
morning. The services were conducted
by Ben Rose, assisted by the others.
The rest of the morning was spent in
conference with the newly-elected offi-
cers and their faculty advisors and in
the selection of the “Y” cabinet mem-
bers for the six departments necessary
in campus life.

This school was established in mem-
ory of Ebenezer Mitchell at Lenoir, N.
C., and was later moved to Misenheimer,
N. C., twenty miles from Salisbury on
the Albemarle highway. It is a denom-
inational school of the Methodist Epis-
copal Church: 2

The school has recently received a
donation of two hundred thousand dol-
lars with whith it plans to build sev-
eral new buildings. The administration
hopes to finish the work of building the
five new dormitories by fall. This will
enable the school to accommodate four
hundred students while it now accom-
modates only one hundred and fifty boys
and’girls. This school is a mission school
and has been doing fine work and the
new dormitories will aid it further.

sal witty production.

Symphonic Band
Presents Concert

Musicians Leave School On Three-
Day Concert Tour Of
North Carolina

Inaugurating a series of concerts which
will take them on a tour throughout
the state, the Davidson College Sym-
phonic Band played an hour-and-a-half
concert before a rapt audiefice of ap-
proximately six hundred students and
friends of the college in Chambers Audi-
torium last Friday night. The program
featured Louise Nelson Pfohl, wife of
the conductor, and A. Moreland Cun-
ningham, as soloists on the piano and
cornet, respectively.

The opening number was a brilliant
concert march by Olivadoti, “Triumph-
ant,’ which carried a pleasing martial
air, but at the same time was not out of
place on the concert st This was
followed by a rendition of the familiar
and stirring “Overture to William Tell,”
its four divisions covering most of the
tempopi of good music. Its wide range
of tone effects, secured by the use of
approximately twenty different instru-
ments, makes the band especially suited
to playing pieces of this kind.

After these two solos the band turned
to music in a more modern and a lighter
vein, playing “Selections from Show
Boat,” that Jerome Kern musical hit of
a few years ago. ‘These: selections in-
cluded “Old Man River,” “Captain
Andy,” “I can't Help Lovin’ Dat Man,”
“Make Believe,” and the waltz, “You
Are Love.” Effects of great color were
obtained throughout this number,
