DAVIDSONIAN

Thursday, March 20, 1941

We hate to depart from the Sport page on a sour note, but
we would like to make a last complaint against one of the in-
tramural eligibility rules. In general, Coach Heath Whittle’s
rules and regulations seem entirely reasonable, but one we can-
not understand,

This rule has to do with the participation of freshmen in
the intrafrat track meet. This meet had not begun when this
was written and perhaps no frosh will even enter it, but this
complaint is for the benefit of future generations. :

The rule, as we understand it, states that all freshmen out tor
spring sports are ineligible, EXCEPT those out for track, To
our way of thinking, this seems a little queer. Those men who
are in training, in-the best physical condition, and have been
running daily, are eligible, yet those who are out for tennis,
golf, or baseball sports not requiring perfect.condition, are not.

Maybe there is some good reason for this regulation, if so,
we would like to hear it. If not, does it not seem reasonable to
change it for future meets?

FOOTBALL FACTS

The Wildcat long, drawn-out football drills finally came to a
close last Saturday with an intersquad scrimmage. The prac-
tice had extended six weeks, the maximum time allotted under
Southern Conference rules.

Such a scrimmage reveals very little as far as the strength
of the team is concerned, but they do show up to a certain extent
the bright features of some individual performers, both in the
line and backfield. .

The fair-haired lad so far has been Ben Lacy, 100 pound
sophomore back from Richmond. Lacy called signals and gen-
erally sparked the Red team to their 18-6 win over the Blacks.

Outstanding in the line have been B. F. Moore and “Butch”
Caldwell, Junior guard and center. Both have shown an ag-
gressive spirit and savage tackling which bode ill for next
year’s Davidson opponents.

Surprise of the drills has been the play of C. C. Morehead.
Filling Coach McEver’s requirements as a smashing type of
end, C. C. has improved steadily in the pass-catching depart-
ment and assures the Wildcats of one well-protected flank.
GENERAL DOPE

Congrats to “Duck” Yarborough on his election to the cap-
taincy of next year’s Wildcat cage team. Also to Mac Morris
and “Squatty” Squires for their managership elections ... Ah,
the fickleness of fate. ‘Take the case of Lou Gehrig, only a few
years ago the idol of American baseball fans. The former
Yankee strong man has been on his back now for months and
the paralysis that took him out of baseball has so overtaken
him that he can hardly hold a cigarette with his stiffened fin-
gers... Apologies to the Betas for omitting them from the in-
tra-mural standings. They are in eighth place with a total of
259.3 points . . . Sensation of the spring training exhibition
games has been Sam Chapman, former All-American gridder
from California. Sammy has an average of .454 from two
homers, a triple, three doubles, and five singles, besides batting
in 14 runs... Watch this Grodzicki, of the Cards. Quite a
twirler, we believe.

By Jimmy Fulcher.

A few of the wrinkles left Coach
Shepherd's brow Monday after-
when his baseball worries
brightened a little with the addi-
tion of five new candidates for the
diamond nine.

noon

Seen on the diamond Monday for
the first time, due to spring foot-
ball drills, were Bill Grosse, Bob
Smith, Frank Caldwell, and Dicky
Phillips. Jim Owens, out for the
first’ few days of practice because
of an infected finger, was holding
down the hot corner.

INFIELD SLOTS SETTLED.

Infield positions are just about
sewed up. by the veterans from last
year's team. On the No. 1 sack,
Bob Carter seems certain to get
the call, but may get some assist-
ance from Frank Niven in case
Bob is summoned to the mound.
At the keystone position, Tommy
Yarborough will again hold the in-
side track. Jimmy Hogg has been
shifted to shortstop from his old
hot-box corner, which will go to
either Owens, Nelson, or Niven.

The outfield worries are still un-
settled, but in practice games early
in the week, Jack Clark, up from
last year’s nine, Doug Horner, who
has impressed the ‘Cat mentor in
spite of lack of experience, Frank
Niven, and Lantham Latta have
been ichasing most of the outfield
knocks.

NUMEROUS RESERVES.

Reserves are plentiful in the in-
field with Caldwell, Latta, Nelson,
Niven, and Phillips furnishing
most of the competition. Bob
Smith, Scotty Poole, and Bob Mc-

Reds Rout
Blacks, 18-6

Spring football drills ended Sat-
urday with an inter-squad game-in
which a veteran Red eleven de-
feated the Blacks, 18-6.

Veterans Herb Rainey, Bill
Shaw, Johnny Frederick and George
Marsh watched from the sidelines,
because of injuries, and Mac Bruce,
Frosh. satelite, and Johnny Miller
saw only limited action.

REDS SCORE FIRST.

The heavier Red machine drew
first blood in the first period, when
Ben Washburn went over tackle
for five yards and the score. A
pass, Washburn to Hackney, ‘good
for forty yards, accounted for the
second tally, and the Reds led, 12-0.

With the leaders backed up on
their own goal, Burke broke
through and blocked Lacy's kick,
Gwynn, recovered for the Blacks
and two plays Earl Bethea bucked
over for six points.

Later in the third period, Ben
Lacy, work-horse for the winners,
culminated, a downfield drive with
the last touchdown of the day.
BOOTH SHINES.

Individual stars for the rough and
tumble contest were hard to se-
lect from the mass of men partici-
pating. Shep Booth’s passing was
up to his usual standards and the
little tailback displayed a talent
for leather lugging heretofore con-
cealed.

In the Red backfield Lacy’s line-

bucks were consistent gainers’ and
