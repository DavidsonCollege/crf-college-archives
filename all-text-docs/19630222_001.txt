Trustees Approve Union Expansion,
Pigeonhole Oath-Evoking Oath Issue

Goodykoontz Goodbye:
Epitaph For Vagabonds?

BY CHARLES RAMBERG

Davidsonian Assignments Editor

“As is the professional theatre, so is college theatre the fabulous invalid,” com-
mented Robert J. Sailstad, chairman of the new Vagabond Governing and Planning
Board this week. “People keep saying it's about to die, but the show goes on,” he

smiled.

Sailstad and his board met
today to. discuss the future of
Davidson’s invalid, left a near-
corpse this week by the resig-
nation of Dr. William F. Goody-
koontz as Vagabonds director
and Student Assistants Neal
Bushoven and Walter Edgar.

At present, the Vagabonds
have no further plans after
Adding Machine completes its
run March 1. The board discuss-
ed ways to continue the produc-
tion of dramatic events for the
remainder of this semester,
thinking in terms of getting var
ious people to direct each sep-
arate function that may be plan-
ned.

"The cooperation of faculty,
administration, and student
body will be required,” Sail-
stad Stated. “The feeling is
that a great deal has been ac-
complished in theatre here
in a short time. We want to
work from there.”

A quiet, meditative Goody-
koontz, interviewed Tuesday by

THE DAVIDSONIAN, was equal-
ly enthusiastic about the three-
year record of the Vagabonds,
citing student reaction to last
week's student play, “November
Requiem” by Billy Trotter, as
proof that the program has been
a success.

And he was optimistic about
the future of the dramatics pro-
gram here. But looking beyond
the present problems, he indi-
cated what he thought are some
necessary changes if the pro-
gram is to continue to be a
success.

He outlined the problems
the Vagabonds have worked
under in the past: inadequate
support from segments of the
administration and faculty;
mot enough student participa-
tion in staff work; too small

uling the use of the Fine Arts
Center, getting transportation,
obtaining adequate supplies as
well as maintaining the pres-
ent equipment.

“These are some of the prob-
lems — recurring problems,”
Goodykoontz observed. “But
they come from a basic at-
titude that while it is pleas-
ant to have an active drama-
tics program it is after all
an extra-curricular program,
low on the list of priorities.

“If the problem is ever to be
solved, that attitude must be
changed. Drama must be recog-
nized as integral to the liberal
arts.”

Goodykoontz made clear what
he feels is needed from the ad-
ministration. “My hope is they
will now do what should have

been done long ago—clearly de-
fine what is expected from the
drama program, I hope it will
continue to be one designed for
the whole student body and not
just a small clique—and that
then they will get the necessary
staff to run such a program.”

Commenting on his past re-
lationships with the adminis-
tration, Goodykoontz said he
had operated under the as-
sumption that the program
had its approval. “1 was as-
sured and re-assured,” he re-
lated. “| think the president
was sincere in those assur-
ances,” he added, “but he is
a very busy man. And some-
where between his approval
and the implementation of it,
there was a gap that was
never quite bridged by ac-
tion.”

A constant problem of the
dramatics program has been
one of insufficient personne).
“I've sent out call after call for
help from the students, faculty,
and administration. Not enough
has been forthcoming. I don’t
think anyone who hasn't active-
ly worked in the program knows
how complicated it is. To put
on a play requires eleven men
in addition to the actors them-
selves.”

“There are many who could

help. Mrs. D. Grier Martin for
example, has had profession-
al training. So have Mr. Sail-
stad and Mrs. Hampton, who
is currently directing ADD-
ING MACHINE.”

As for those without training,
Goodykoontz noted that the
freshmen, usually a mainstay of
the program, have been missing
this year. “There are more up-
perclassmen than ever, but far
fewer freshmen than in the
past,” he commented.

Noting that the Vagabonds
only had one full-time man
working last semester, Goody-
koontz stated that at least three
are needed. A full-time drama-
ties director, a full-time techni-
cal assistant to handle the light-
ing and sound aspects as well
as his other duties, and a full-
time secretary are minimum re-
quirements.

Goodykoontz reported that
the secretarial help promised
him after Don Stowell quit
and Mr. Lilly had to stop help-
ing has never materialized be-
yond the point of an offer to
set up interviews with appli-
cants. Now that is in doubt
due to his resignation.

Goodykoontz indicated that
part of the reason for his resig-

Group Hears Plans
For Lake Norman

The faculty oath controversy which featured the
latest meeting of the Davidson College Board of Trustees

| was referred for further study to the Trustee Education
Committee and seemed little closer to being settled as

the executives left the campus late Wednesday afternoon.

The major portion of the final
afternoon session on the second
floor of Chambers was devoted
to the oath problem, Faculty
members W. F. Cumming, L.
White, and D. D. Rhodes pre-
sented various arguments of the
faculty against the oath as it
now stands, while Dr. J. B.
Gallent gave the affirmative
view. The Trustees addressed
numerous questions to the pro-
fessors throughout.

Earlier President D. Grier
Martin had reported the results
of the recent questionnaire poll
of faculty members on the sub-
ject. The poll had showed two-
thirds of the faculty opposed to
the oath in its present form.
The questionnaire gave the dis-
senters no chance to express
their varying opinions on how
they would like to see the oath
changed. ;

Remarked Martin, “The main
objection of the majority of
those opposed to the oath seems
to be in the manner in which
it is administered (at public
graduation exercises.)”

Both Martin and Trustee
Chairman Dr. J. McDowell
Richards felt that there was
very little opposition to the
spirit of the oath, and that the
final solution would probably
be a compromise in which the
oath was kept in its present
form but would be administered
privately, as part of the hiring
process.

Stanley ‘Burns’ Cigarettes,
Tells Of Faking Russians

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The pre-meds and other science students swarmed around him like flies to
honey. But they, unlike flies stuck to a honey jar, were there because of their inter-
est in the knowledge that Dr. Wendell M. Stanley could give to them in an under-
standable and interesting way.

And like the great teacher he
is at heart, our latest Reynolds
Lecturer could not turn away
from student questions at the
several informal discussions
that had been set up for him
te meet our scholars. He answer-
ed every question asked him to
the best of his abundant ability.

If some of his remarks made
here ever get out very far,
the Tampa people will love
Dr. Stanley, but the tobacco
folks closer to home may have
a different opinion of him.
He stated that he had quit
smoking cigarettes because
some of his scientific col-
leagues think that the high
burning temperature of the
tobacco in them produces a
cancer-causing substance.

He feels that the statistical

Lewrimore)

specker heard here ino tong while. He proved
mest receptive te questions that students asked
him in informal discussions. (Staff Pheto by

evidence linking lung cancer to
smoking is too great not to heed.
But he did say that small cigars
are the happy medium for to-
bacco cravers. “I even switched
to them, myself,’’ he comment-
ed.

One fellow asked Dr. Stanley
if he should advise his wife to
start puffing cigars. ‘“‘Sure,” was
the answer the noted virologist
gave.

A weed addict in the group of
students clustered about the
doctor asked him if filters did
any good in aiding his health
while he smoked. “I think that
the only solution is to lower the
burning temperature,” he an-
swered “But the tobacco folks
say that they won't taste as good
then. So there is not much
chance in that.”

He made a few comments
on the polio vaccine that
seemed to generate a stir a-
mong the more hypochondria-
cal members of his audience.
He announced that among the
first lots of the Salk vaccine
produced in this country
there were some that contain-
ed a cancer producing chemi-
cal. This vaccine was never
released in this country, how-
ever.

But the good part of this story
should make all fanatical Red
haters snicker with glee
seems that the vaccine contain-
ing SV40 (that’s the chemical
that produces cancer in the kid-
neys of humans, not a new
miracle discovery used in some
tooth paste that will prevent
cavaties and bad breath for a
week) was released in Russia,
and 20 million of our enemies
got the shots.

And the best part of it all is
that the Russians will never
find out that the wicked State
Department sabotaged them
with the vaccine. “I don't think

| their statistics are that good

over there to pick it up,” Dr.
Stanley commented wryly.

Dr. Stanley took time out
from his technical discussions
to explode the flu vaccina-
tion myth. He said that medi-
cal science first developed a
successful flu vaccine in 1944.

He blamed young, inexper-
jenced doctors for the fact that
the public has no confidence in
it.

Several students commented
that Dr. Stanley is the best
Reynolds Lecturer that David-
son has ever had. Some of them
came from liberal arts majors.
He had knowledge; a love to
teach what he knew; and a sense
of humor that made all of his
talks, both formal and informal,
very interesting. .. .

Commented Richards, “It is
the primary responsibility and
interest of the Trustees to main-
tain the college's Christian wit-
ness through its traditional con-
nection with the Presbyterian
Church. We see no reason for
changing what has worked well
through the years, and we would
have to be convinced a change
was necessary and wise before
it was made. But we will cer-
tainly carefully consider the is-
sue—it won't be closed in ad-
vance.”

The committee to which the
problem has been referred
will meet in the coming
months with various faculty
representatives. A report and
possibly a proposed solution
will be presented to the
Trustees at their next meet-
ing, probably in the spring.

In other business brought up|
before the board, President |
Martin announced the hiring of
three new faculty members for
next year: Dr. Frank Bliss, Jr.,
presently of St. Olaf’s (Minn.)
College, will be associate pro-
fessor of English. Dr. Philip
Secor will be assistant profes-
sor of Political Science. A for-
mer Ford Fellow and James B.
Duke Fellow, Dr. Secor will
come from Dickinson College,
where he is Acting Dean and
Director of Religious Affairs |
as well as a teacher. Bliss and
Secor will also assist in the sec-
ond-year Humanities program.

William B. Patterson, Jr., a)
former Rhodes Scholar, and a.
holder of the MA and BD de-
grees, is expected to receive his
doctorate from Harvard this |
year. He will come as associate |
professor of History. }

The trustees also learned of
and approved two future im-,
provement projects for the col-
lege community, an expansion
of College Union facilities and a
development of 106 acres of)
Lake Norman shore-line prop-|
erty, a recent gift of the Duke |
Power Company. The $250,000)
Union expansion and renovation
will begin in early spring with
construction of a new wing
which will improve and increase
the size of nearly all present
Union facilities.

“The improvement in our

Union facilities has been
needed since our student
body reached its planned

1000-student size. The addi-

building will give Davidson a |
Union of the first class in
every respect and in keeping
with other facilities on the
campus.”

At this meeting the board took

The Student Council adopted plans for next

this week.

Several changes in the Stud-
ent Council By-Laws dealing
with the elections were adopted.
These revisions wil! significant-
ly reduce the length of time re-
quired to complete all of the
voting.

Under the new system inaug-
urated by the by-laws, there
will be three stations which will
punch a card to be issued to
every student each time he votes
in an election. The new system
will therefore eliminate lengthy
waiting in line.

The by-laws also have been
changed so that candidates
for cheerleader will be nom-
inated by the returning cheer-
leaders rather than the entire
student body. For the first
time, the Wildcat Handbook
election has heen included in
the by-laws. It will continue
to be held in the fall; the only
change is that it has been
given official recognition.

Ideas for some of the changes
came from the NSA Convention,

which President Danny Carrell
and John Spratt attended last
summer

Paul Duvall was chosen to
head the Elections Board, which

| will supervise the elections. The

council also picked 16 seniors to
serve with Duvall on the board

In other matters, Fred Mc-
Guirt reported that the plan
to allow student parking be-
hind the Fine Arts Building
had been dropped by the Dean
of Students Office. McGuirt
said that the Assistant Dean
of Students gave no reason
for the action.

The council did not discuss |

the matter any further because
of other business. “We're not

Ratliff Will Leave
For Pakistan Stint

Dr. Charles E. Ratliff, Jr.,
professor of economics, has an-
nounced that he will leave Dav-
idson at the end of the current
term and spend three years as a

lay missionary in Lahore, Pakis-|

tan.

Ratliff will serve as a profes-
sor of economics at Forman
Christian College, a school about
Davidson's size. He will be re-
sponsible for setting up advanc-
ed undergraduate courses and a
masters program in economics.
He will be one of several Ameri-

going to take this sitting down,
though—that’s for sure,” Car-
rell exclaimed, obviously piqued
at the news.

Three Davidson men are in
Chapel Hill attending a mock
UN Assembly. The session be-
gan on Thursday and will end
this weekend

Wic Cooney, Lewis Martin,
and Ben Moore are the students

faculty meeting.

The specific point to which
his anger is directed is the faet
that the faculty merely changed
the rule which allowed fraterni-
ties to have only one official
function per semester and made
it legal for them to have any
number of official functions in a
semester, Carrell had requested
that the rule be abolished en

tirely.

Carrell said that he had re
quested the abolition of the rule
because it was obselete. “Why
have something on the books
|that was ignored by students
and. faculty alike?” he asked.
| “Most fraternities only have one
| official function chaperoned by

j}members of the faculty in an
fentire year, but they all have
| after-dance parties,” he pointed
‘out. Technically, after-dance
| parties are illegal, but the col-
lege has thus far officially ignor-
ed them
Carrell stated that when he
made his request to the Fa-
culty Committee on Fraterni-
ties, Clubs, and Social Life,
he thought that they were go-
ing to have the rule abolished.
He said that one member of
the committee had openly
agreed with him that there
was no longer need for any
rule whatsoever.

“As it turns out,” Carrell said,
“they have not changed the sit-
uation. at all. The only thing
that they have done is to have
changed the wording of the
rule.” He laughed as he added,
“I don’t know what makes them
think that they have accomplish-
ed anything; none of the frater-
nities want to hold more official
functions than the old rule al-
lowed, anyway.”

When asked the reason why
the faculty changed the rule,
both Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts and his assistant, Gus

Burgdort, stated that Carrell
asked them

Lake Norman plans, and pro-

posed Union expansion. The next meeting of
the Trustees will be in May.

Caustic Carrell Censures
Faculty's Recent Decision

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Editor

Student Body President Danny Carrell's tone in his
latest DAVIDSONIAN interview left no doubt that he
was more than a little angry with the results of the last

said the following words: “This
(the change of the rule) came
about on a request on Carrell’s
part to change the rule govern-
ing the affairs (of the fraterni-
ties).” There is, of course, a
very sharp difference between
the meaning of the word “abol-
ish” and the word “change.”
Burgdorf also commented
that the rule was not a build-
up for a decision on the after-
dance parties. Burts added,
however, that the parties were
under constant consideration
and some action about them
could be taken in the future.
Carrell said that he had also
pressed the cammittee to abol-
ish the off-campus drinking rule
once again. “But they would not
step down on their opinion at
all about keeping this rule,”
Carrell said. He indicated that
he felt that it was hopeless to

press the faculty any more
about the drinking rule.
Carrell did say, however,

that he might try once again
to get the faculty to complete-
ly abolish the rule about of-
ficial fraternity functions. He
also said that he would bring
up once more at the next
meeting of the Traffic Com-
mittee the matter of student
parking behind the Fine Arts
Center.

“The last time this commit-
tee met, they promised Student
Council Representatives John
Spratt and Hill Wellford that
they would permit limited stud-
ent parking behind the Fine
Arts Center,” Carrell said. That
was in January; nothing has
been done since then to change
the parking situation. Carrell
said that when he asked Burts
about the matter, the dean said
that he thought the raatter had
been dropped.

“They had definitely promised
to take action about the matter,”

to. Burgdorf Carrell stated.
