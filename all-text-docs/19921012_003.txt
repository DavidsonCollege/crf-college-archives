J ewish Author, Filmmaker Speaks at Davidson

By Kyle Kinner

On October Sth, Davidson
College hosted the distinguished
Jewish author and filmmaker,
Jerome Badanes. Following the
public screening of Badanes’ docu-
mentary “Image Before My Eyes,”
the author addressed aspects of the
film’s subject, Pre- WWII Polish-
Jewish culture, and read from his
recently published novel, The Fi-
nal Opus of Leon Solomon (Simon
and Schuster, 1990). Badanes par-
ticipated in Karl Plank’s senior
religion seminar, Holocaust and
the Construction of Memory ear-
lier that day. The following repre-
sents a portion of Mr. Badanes’
responses to questions raised about
his life and work.

“,.anyway, YIVO [an insti-
tute constituted for the study of
Jewish culture, YIVO was the pri-
mary sponsor of Badanes’ efforts]
was making a film. That’s where I
came in. They asked a number of
people to work on the film and I
was one of these people. My inter-
est in the film was sort of compli-
cated; anumber of reasons, one of
which [was that] I needed the
money.

household. I was bom right before
the war and I was raised in a Yid-
dish speaking [environment], Yid-
dish was my first language. I was
a homebound kid because I was
underweight, I was colic, sol stayed
in the house a lot

withmy mother and

my mother wasalso
a Yiddish folk-
singer. But when I
became big enough
to play in the streets
I discovered that
Yiddish was not
helping me, that I
needed English;
and I spoke English
with a very thick...
. accent, and there-
fore I was given a
hard time by the
kids, not just gen-
tile kids, but Jew-

“Myneighbor-
hood was in Brook-
lyn, New York. The
neighborhood is
called Bensonhurst,
which has recently
become infamous
because [of] a ter-
rible racial incident
there. There were
only Jews and Ital-
ians living in
Bensonhurst when
I was growing up, in fact I thought
that the world consisted of Jews
and Italians. The only two politi-
cal parties that I was familiar with
when I was growing up, the two
major political parties, were the

Democrats and the Communists.
There were no Republicans; I was
spared growing up with Republi-
cans... and I thank God for that.

“So, I grew up in that kind of
atmosphere, and I wanted to be a

regular kid on the streets and play
softball and basketball. Well, they
didn’t play basketball in Yiddish
in Brooklyn and I had to learn
‘English. And it was hatd. My
grandmother would walk me to

school and I would hate when she
spoke Yiddish to me. I really
wanted to unlearn Yiddish. But

what I didn’t unlearn were the cul-

tural lessons and the cultural val-
ues of my parents. They were not
Communists but
they weren’t anti-
Communists, andin
the fifties this coun-
try was consumed
by anti-Commu-
nism.

“Social justice
was very important,
so for example, it
seemed for me a
part of being Jew-
ish, when I got a
little older, to be a
part of the civil
rights movement.
And then later, to
become part of the
movement to end
the war in Vietnam.
That seemed to me
to be part of being
Jewish, partof what
my parents taught
me. And thatI kept
intack; but the Yid-
dish part was
pushed away.

“The film was
an opportunity for
me to reach back
into that world I
came from. So for
me, it was a great three years of
rediscovering who I was. It was
very exciting. I found actually, I
was embarrassed to speak Yiddish
with my colleagues at the YIVO
institute because I spoke it so bro-
kenly. But I found that I could
really communicate with some of
these [surviving Jews] when I
started interviewing them [for the
documentary]. So the reason I
chose to work on the film was an
attempt to reclaim that part of my

background.

“I was also brought up in an
atmosphere of the Holocaust . .
most of the members of my
mother’s family and my father’s
family were in Poland and they
were murdered. During the war, I
remember, every night my father
listening to the radio, and what he
was listening for was news about
Jews. If you look, if you do re-
search back in that period, you
mightsee little articles about geno-
cide on page 18 of the New York
Times. Little, tiny articles; it wasn’t
big news... the big news was the
war and the battles that were rag-
ing. It was these experiences that
I carried with me as I grew up and
became a writer, and became ac-
tive in the civil rights movement
and the anti-war movement. But I
missed the taste of Yiddish, and
this film was an opportunity to -
reclaim that for myself.

“When you make a film...
first I interviewed on tape, and
then I transcribed all the tapes
myself because I wanted to have
them inside me. I lived with them
for a number of years. When you :
make a film, you make choices.
You don’t use everything you get;
in fact, you film ataten to one ratio
and you film ten hours to make a
onehour film. And sol was haunted
by the films we didn’t make, and
all those other stories. But since
the film was not about the Holo-
caust, but about the culture that
was destroyed, wede-emphasized,
in making the film, everyone’s
Holocaust [memories]... “A1-
most all the; people 1 interviewed
were survivors and most of them
couldnotspeak about the lives that
they lived before without first talk-
ing about the Holocaust. I had
story after story about the Holo-
caust. You never know what you
can use.”
