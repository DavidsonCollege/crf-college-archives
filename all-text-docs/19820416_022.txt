POLY SUEDE SES BEADS IAD ett 8 ALCS ®

The women’s tennis team is well on
its way to another winning. season this
year, with a record of 14-5. Despite a
tougher schedule than last year’s, the
team has won some tough matches.

Surprisingly after losing two seniors
from last year’s top six, the team is do-
ing well. “Our strength; on the team as a
whole, is our depth in good players,”

says team member Catherine Smith.-

The top six players do have consistent,
‘strong games. The line-up is: 1. Emmy
Knobloch; 2. Sue Hilton; 3. Catherine
Smith; 4. Adelyn: Lutz; 5. Adelaide
Wilcox; 6. Joanna Fleming. Tricia Ives

is an asset as a partner for number 3 dou-.

bles. The.team fares well in the individ-
ual matches, the doubles matches pres-
ent an Achilles heel. Coach Pat Miller
tries various partnerships, changing
them according to the strength of the op-
position.

Monday they suffered a disappoint- 2

ing 5-4 loss at High Point. Knobloch,
Smith, and Fleming won their singles
and Smith-Wilcox won in doubles.
The team cruised to an easy 8-1 win
over Winthrop. Almost everyone

4 played well in the singles, and the dou- fon.

bles solidified as well.

The ladies’ next matches are here.

Monday against Pfeiffer, and Tuesday

‘against hated UNCC. The team will use
‘those two matches as tuneups  for-the

State Tournament to. be held at UNCC
April 22-24, and the Lady Wildcats

have their eyes on the crown. The = ”

toughest competition will come. from

UNCC, whom they have beaten in the’

regular season, and East “Carolina,
whom they can probably take.
