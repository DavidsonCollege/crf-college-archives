Delta Phi Alpha Group

To Give German Movie

Poem ER |

“Der Hauptman von Koep-
nek” Title of Pre-Nazi
Satire.

Delta Phi Alpha, national Ger-
man honorary fraternity, will pre-
sent a motion picture, “Der Haupt-

man von Koepenek,” Monday
night, April 14, in Chambers Audi-
torium.

“Der Hauptman von Koepenek,”
which in English means “The Cap-
tain of Kopenek,” a small suburb
of Berlin, is based on the comedy
of the same name. The plot
is true and sincere, and since it is
noted as a pro-Nazi picture, it has
been banned from showing in Ger-
many. Actually, the film is a sa-
tire on the German

All of the conversation is in Ger-
man and Dr.
students taking German to attend.
However, for those students with-
out a knowledge of the
language, Dr. Vowles has prepared
detailed summary of the story
so that the events of the picture
can be-easily followed.

The. picture not Nazi propa-
ganda, but rather is pro-Nazis. The
entire student body is invited to at-
tend, without admission. The pre-
sentation will begin at 8 o'clock.

The Davidson Civic Club,
posed of the ladies of the town,
is now promoting a drive to sup-
ply the Davidson Graded School,
the Davidson Colored School, and
Unity Church with magazines.

They have designated Friday,
March 21, Magazine Day, on which
the Hi-Y Club will co-operate by
canvassing the town for old maga-
zines.

The student body has been asked
to co-operate by saving and having
ready for collection all their old
periodicals on this date. Letters
have been written to the fraterni-
ties_to save all of their magazines
for this cause.

Any and all magazines are want-
ed and needed in this drive, as
those which cannot be used di-
rectly will be sold to a Charlotte
paper firm.

“Yaller Gal.” :

Preliminary debate trials by
Jim McCrary and Bill Tyson
took up the rest of the time.
Members were called upon to

Marshal Ney (?)
Designed Seal

By Charles

How many Davidson students ac-
tually know the meaning of the de-
sign on the College Seal and the
correct translation of the motto?
Probably many of who don't
know much Latin and don't
have a great deal intellectual
curiosity have often been vaguely
bothered by the Alenda Lux Ubi
Orta Libertas glaring at us every
time enter Chambers.

” The seal was designed in 1840 by
a'gentleman in the vicinity of Da-
vidson noted throughout this
tion for. his scholastic ability.
was a teacher by profession, and
called himself Peter Stuart Ney,
although it seems generally con-
ceded that he was no less a per-
sonage than the celebrated Marshal
Ney.

In the design, as most of us have
probably noticed, right
hand is piercing with a dagger the
coiled in the lower half.
Rays of light flash from a= star
set above the dagger’s handle.
Around the design are two rings,
between which appears the motto.

Brockman,

sec-

He

a man's

serpent

Freely translated, it means, “Light
is nourished where liberty is
arisen.”

Across the center of the seal is a
bar bearing “Ne Ultra.” The de-
sign was approved and adopted
at the next meeting of the board.
An expert in heraldry has sug-
gested that the “seal intends to
separate between the light of learn-
ing and religion and the baleful in-
fluences of ignorance and unbelief.”

Finally, they “cooked” up an ex-

travagant ballyhoo campaign un-
heard of in Army circles, which
had as its central theme women
and horses. The mental picture
of himself resplendent upon an
Army charger lured many an un-
dergraduate into the R. O. T. °C.
during those days.

In 1929, Princeton put the first

college polo team on the field since

1903. Its renaisance at Prince
ton and other colleges was due
to the establishment of the mount-

Horses, however, ‘were not. the
most important lure that was used
by.-these in charge. The appeal

of the fairer sex was destined for
greater things under the new or-
der. Co-eds made honorary
officers and marched with the R.
O. T. C. officers in parades. The
Army, man’s age-old retreat from
women, actually advocating the ad-
mission of co-eds into the college
