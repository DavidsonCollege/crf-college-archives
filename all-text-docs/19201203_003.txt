The close of the 1920 Class Basketball
Series brings to light the fact that for
the second time the class of 1922 is the
undisputed title holder. The quint rep-
resenting the Junior Class amply demon-
strated the fact that they are the best
by going thru the inter-class series with
six victories to their credit and no de-
feats. In only one game were they

seriously threatened, having to push

themselves to the limit in that contest
with the Fresh wherein they nosed out
their younger rivals by one goal only.
The rivalry during the entire series was
very much in evidence and large crowds
were on hand at the different contests
to cheer their cohorts on to victory. The
games were interesting and hard fought
and all the teams displayed a brand of
basketball plus fighting spirit worthy to
oo

yards. McFadden made three and ttien

The two forwards of the victorious
Junior team did most of the scoring,
Doubles doing the greater part. He leads
the field of individual scorers listed be-
low. Tho during the first half of the
series the individual scoring was rather
closely bunched, the latter part of the
season they were rather more spread
out. Each team displayed flashes of bril-
tiant team work that did not show up
the individuals alone, but the best shots
were not to be denied and the ones given
below lead their teams in scoring. Tho
the Varsity team is practically intact
this year, s6me of the men who have
been putting up such good games dur-
ing the class series will be right there
with the goods, and the old letter men
will have to make a hard fight to retain
their old positions. The leaders in scor-
ing are as follows:

Juniors, 36; Seniors, 20

The Seniors closed their class basket-
ball career Friday night by losing a hard
fought game to the Juniors. The victory
was the twelfth straight win for the '22
quintet, and rounded out the second sea-
son that they have won the champion-
ship with a perfect average. The Ju-
niors showed their superiority early in
the game by rolling in five baskets be-
fore the Seniors had a good shot at the
goal. The Seniors then seemed to take
on new life and during the remainder of
the half they collected five baskets while
the Juniors had to be satisfied with two.
This half was cleanly playag, only one
foul being called. The half @nded 14-10
in the Juniors’ favor.

The Juniors opened the second half
with a rush. By the almost perfect
shooting of A. C. Ormond and Doubles,
and the guarding of Ervin, the Seniors
were completely swamped. Miley show-
ed up best for the Seniors in this half.
Besides his usual good floor game, he
led his team in scoring, making shots
from near the middle of the floor.

The Juniors were without the services
of their high-stepping guard, Price, but
his place was ably filled by McCrary.
This lad in his first game of class bas-
ketball played a splendid guarding game
and added eight points to his team’s to-
tal. The centers, Heizer and Cornelson,
each got three baskets in the first half.
But they must have called it a draw, for

neither was able to score in the second
half. The line-up was: ‘
Seniors. Position. Juniors.
