Foreign
Policies

By Rene DeV.. Williamson

THE FRENCH

Perhaps
foreign policy is harder to un-
derstand than that of France.
Both its objectives and its
methods are largely a matter
of conjecture at the present
moment. One may even wond-
er if France has a policy at all.

For a people like the .French,
such a situation is-altogether extra-
ordinary. The French by nature are
strong adherents of clearness, pre-
cision, consistency, and definiteness.

“They want to be governed by clear

knowing where they are going and
how to get there, and prize security

and -stability..more than anything
else. The present state of affairs,

. |
therefore, is extremely abnormal

and has been so since 1934, when

a French Prime Minister, Pierre
Laval, wrecked the League of Na-
tions by refusing to apply full sanc-

tions—against Ltaly.

Old Policy

Until, 1934, French foreign policy
Was_exactly what anyone knowing
the French people would expect, It

British, like that
of Russia, nor aggressively oppor-

AGAR SAYS
DEMOCRACY
S FAILING

Author
Speaks In Chambers On
Americanism

| Noted Americnn

In his lecture in Chambers
Auditorium Monday night, Dr.
Herbert Agar, Pulitzer prize
winner in 1935, announced his

subject, Americanism and}
What it Represents. ee
“Six European “countries,” Agar
declared, “have -abandoned what
they called democracy because
they do not believe in its prin-

ciples and in the goal it sets for

their country. By their example
Americans could learn a lesson
that, should save them from the

same fate.” .
Cause of Slackness

Primarily, the cause for their

slackness was on account of their
disbelief in the theory of democ-

racy. Consequently, democracy a§

a form of government does not ex-

ist in ‘those half-dozen countries

today, since they refused to assume
the burdens that accompanied the
blessings of democracy.

“For Americans to assume the
burdens of*»democracy,” it was
further pointed out, “they must
assume one. obligation—td” know

What is going on around them and
to know what they mean by the

ideal that, Americans profess to |
have.” é |

To understand the principles of |
democracy one must distinguish |

between the two terms democ
and liberty.
Three Conditions

Democra

Dr.
Agar takes in three conditions —
moral, economic and .political. Pri-

to

>y, according

the moral
should be believed — one, that in
this world the uniting elements
of mankind are stronger than the
separating elements, and the other,
that of elevating
himself ‘with the proper surroynd-
ings.

marily, obligations

man is capable

Whey the moral issues are under-
the next step
seeking democracy is to understand

stood of a people
that they must-help the poor eco-
nomic conditions that exist in their
nation. When this obligation is un-
derstood, we assume that we must
still maintain the political
| machinery that has previously been
set up in this democracy.

Thursday night concluded the
Fall Services at Davidson for
this..year...The—meetings, led
by Rev. Sam Wiley, were held
twice a day, Tuesday through
Thursday. :

In the course of the services, Rev.
Mr. Wiley made six addresses. The
first of these, given Tuesday morn-
ing in chapel, had.as its theme a
description of the full grown man.
The characteristics of, and the re-
quirements necessary to be met in
order to become a fully grown man
were enumerated.

The second address was a char-
acter study of Judas. In this, Mr.
Wiley brought out the relation of
the traitorous disciple to Christ and
to the .other disciples, Especially
emphasized the man's tragic
and ignoble death at his own hand.

The theme of the Wednesday
morning address was, Pathways to
God, According to Mr, Wiley, these
three pathways are Earnestness,
Goodness, and Repentance.

: Christian Growth

On Wednesday night, Mr. Wiley

discussed Christian Growth. He said

was

that, since there is a_price to pay
for neglect in spiritual life, a ‘con-
stant vigilance necessary. On
the other hand, a calm trust, like
that of the lily of the field, is the
secret of Christian growth. His re-
concilliation of these > two

Thursday morning’s talk, bear-

ing the theme, “Lord, Teach Us To
Pray,” was a discussion, petition by
petition, of the Lord’s Prayer. The
final address, given Thursday night,
was, Meditation on the Cross. Mr.
Wiley spoke of the cross as a hid-
den mystery of God’s wisdom, He
stated that the cross shows the way
of God with man and of man with
God, and that the cross must be-
personalized. A communion
followed this address.

The Davidson Music Department

were Billy Rogers, baritone, and
