THE DAVIDSONIAN

Rock'n Roll,Lettermen Trio
To Star In Spring Frolics Gala

Friday Night Concert
May Be Held At Lake

By DON CARROLL
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Spring Frolics, April 23.24, according to former IFC

President Rick von Unwerth,

will be aimed at satisfying

the rock 'n’ roll cravings of the Davidson student body.

A dance weekend inno-
vation tentatively schedules
the Friday night concert at
the lake campus, provided
that this plan is approved at
the meeting of the IFC Mon-
day night.

Pending a faculty dec:sion on
the 1FC proposals which would
release the IFC of its dance
weekend chores. the JFC has
gone All out for this year's
Spring Frolics.

Aceording to acting IFC Pres.
ident Fred Sackett: ‘I. think
Spring Frolics represents the
culmination of the variety the
IFC has tried to offer the entire
year. It should:be just great.”

-Dionne Warwick and Mary
Wells will perform Friday night,
and Fred Smoot and The Letter-
meh will. be in Chambers Audi
torium on Saturday night.

Complementing the gala spring
affair are a baseball game with
Georgia Southern and a tennis
match with Oglethorpe on Fri-
day. The Davidson Relays and
the North Carolina solo and
small ensemble ‘contest on Sat-
urday will, probably not steal
the attention of too many poten-
tial Frolicers.

The weekend entertainment
planned by Rick. von Unwerth
will again feature the dual three-

Fund Established
For Pika Juniors |

A memorial fund has been
established for John Triplett,
Preston St. Clair, and Mike
Bell, the only Davidson stud-
ents to be involved in fatal au-
tomobile accidents in ‘recent
years.

All three were members of,
the Class of '66 and Pi Kappa
Alpha.

Triplett was killed in May,
1964, and Bell and St. Clair
were killed in October, 1964.

The memorial fund, established
by Pi Kappa Alpha, will divide
all contributions among three

Dr. K. E. St. Clair has estab-
lished a scholarship fund at Dav-
idson, to which contributions
will be made.

Bell's minister has established
a memorial fund at Lexington's
First Lutheran Church to which
the Davidson fund will contrib-
ute.

A memorial to Triplett, in the
Grifton Methodist Church, will

Radio-T V Fellowship
Named For Scruggs

A fellowship in communica-
tions has been. established in
memory of William M. Scruggs,
‘49, director of sales at WSOC-

TV in Charlotte, until his death
last winter.

President D. Grier Martin, in
announcing the fellowship stat-
ed, ‘‘The fellowship, to be an an-
nual award to a student of out-
standing interest and promise in
the communications field, was
made possible by individuals
and firms in the Charlotte com-
munity who knew and admired
Bill Scruggs.

“The fellowship, we trust, will
serve to inspire other young
men to look to endeavor in the
communications field as a se-
lected area for service. Certain-
ly the young men can find no
more fitting example of service
and achievement than the man
whose name is on this fellow-
ship.”

Vick Makes Changes In S’nP Format

By BOB TRAVERS
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Believing that “Davidson Col-

lege can and must produce a
magazine of high quality,”
Charles Vick, newly elected ed-
itor of Seripts ‘n Pranks, and his
staff have begun a vast revamp-
ing of the traditional campus
magazine.

In the new S‘nP, they hope to
publish short stories, essays, po-
etry and features which will in-
clude profiles, biographical
sketches and reviews of contem-
porary authors and forum arti-
cles on pertinent issues.

Humor will be somewhat de-
emphasized in the new maga-
zines, but certainly not ignored.
A literary and humor publication
—as the original was—is the goal
of the staff. “The humor, if it is
to be printed, must be of a higher
sort from that seen in the past,”
Vick declared. ;

“Categorically, vulgarity will
not be allowed. There will be no
stolen humor. There is no reason

for it. If it is a Davidson maga-
zine, it must be Davidson ma-

terial.”

“A good number of students
and faculty is already showing
genuine, active interest in the
new concept,” he said. Dr. Wink-
ler and Herb Jackson have con-
tributed poetry, and Henry Wil-
mer and John Pruett have con-
tributed short stories.

“Having changed the format,
we are now in the process of de-
veloping the organization neces-
sary to effect the new concept.
There has never really been any
effective concern about this be-
fore,” Vick explained.

A staff composed of rising
sophomores, juniors and seniors
has been assembled. Bob Holla-
day, John Compton, Ben Lahey
and Louis Hill comprise the art
committee of the staff, while
Harry Carr, Bill Puckett, Woody
Coleman and Arnie Goodstein
make up the business commit-
tee.

The members of the editorial
staff are Bob Dugger, Sid Farrar,
Bob Cameron, Paul Monk, Ted
Glusman and Phil Jones. “The
staff is going to edit this maga-
zine rather than write it,” stress-
ed Vick, although staff members
will contribute to the magazine
just as other students.

An Advisory Board for the
magazine has also been formed.
Its members represent the facul-
ty and. administration, the liter-
ary societies, Sigma Upsilon (hon-
orary creative writing fraternity),
the fraternity group and the In-
dependents. “This board has no
relation to any previous boards,
and is chiefly to advise the edi-
tors,” Vick explained.

In a statement distributed to
members of the faculty and Ad-
ministration, the editors said,
“We want to stimulate and ele-
vate the campus literary interest
and improve the standing of Da-
vidson in the field of college pub-
lications.”

“Actually,” Vick said, “the
main thing is we just want a
magazine we can read twenty
years from now.” He was quick to
point out that “Graduate schools
keep track of college activities,
and so the magazine will actual-
ly be aiding the students them-
selves more than anything.”

The staff has decided that
there will be no regular spring
issue of Seripts ‘n Pranks this
year, but there will be a publica-
tion of some kind. Vick explained
that the staff is spending its
time ‘‘gathering material, talking
with printers, and organizing the
staff so it can do the job.”

The staff has made plans and
is now working to put them into
effect, but Vick emphasized that
any success is going to depend
on the interest of the people in
the college community, He said,
“We must have a steady flow of
contributions in order to main-
tain publication over a sustained
period of expansion.”

for a four-hour course. For the
third term the cost will be
$141.00 for a three-hour course,
No four-hour courses are offer-
ed during the last term.

The maximum load permitted
for the summer session is three
hours per term in a non science

course and four hours per term '.

in a science course.

Commented Registrar F. W.
Hengeveld, ‘‘Our summer school
students are here mainly to
make up work in their courses.
Others attend either to supple-
ment their. regular studies or in
order to graduate in three
years,"

Digressing slightly to com-
ment on the tri-semester sys-
tem employed at some colleges,
he pointed out, “I really don't
see the great advantage in this
tri-semester system. Graduate
schools generally prefer stu-
dents with four years of college.
and besides, there is just too
much else for young people to
do in the summer.

A student can graduate from
Davidson in three years, but the
response to our summer school
has shown no trend at all to-
ward this.”

The summer session is open
to students enrolled at Davidson
or other colleges, recent high
School graduates, teachers, and
adults in the vicinity.

The summer session catalog
and further information con-
cerning the session may be ob-
tained at the registrar's office.

it appropriate to have a course
in philosophy of science.”

Johnston pointed out that this
course was especially needed in
view of the large number of pre-
med students at Davidson. In
addition it would broaden the de-
partment and _ hopefully, he
thought, make a philosophy ma-
jor more attractive to students.

Officially designated Philos-
ophy 53, philosophy of science
will investigate the nature of
scientific explanations and _ the-
ories, study their methodology
and terminology, and particu-
larly emphasize contemporary
views of scientific explanation.
‘MacCormac will also instruct
Symbolic Logic, Philosophy 36,
which will be a study of the de-
velopment of propositional cal-
culus and offer a brief jntro-
duction to axiomatic set the-
ory.

In further changes stated by
a report of the Curriclum Com-
mittee, Bible 24, Apocalyptic
Literature, will be discontinued,
and Bible 51, American Relig-
ious Thought, will be offered
next year. This new course, to -
be taught by Dr. Daniel D.
Rhodes, will present a study of
the movements, men, and ideas
that have contributed to the for-
mation of American religious
tradition.

The only other new course
next year will be Mathematics
43, 44, Numerical Analysis and
Computers I and Il. This course
will give an introduction to com-
puters and provide an opportun-
ity for study with the IBM 1620.
It will deal primarily with prob-
lems of numerical analysis as
they are related to the com-
puter.
