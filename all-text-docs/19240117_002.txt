Clifford Rankin Crawford****

Clifford Rankin Crawford, known to many
of the present student body as “Pat,” gradu-
ated from Davidson with the class of 1923,
having made a record of which any man
would be truly proud, a record which re-
flects upon Pat his ability as an athlete and
his accomplishments as a social ‘factor, as
well as the respect in which he was held by
the student body.

From the very beginning it was recognized
that Pat was destined to be a leader in stu-
dent activities, and to attain honor in’ an
athletic way. In his Freshman year he made
his letter in) baseball, playing an outfield
position, The next year he was shifted to
the initial sack, and there he remained until
his graduation, making three stars for the
remaining years. Pat was indeed at home
on first, and handled everything that came
within his reach, and many throws
seemed out of his reach. At the plate he
was a good wielder of the bat, and when final
averages compiled, he found
among the first.
worth he was chosen as an All-State man
in 1922, a distinct honor, and in his Senior
year piloted the Wildcats through the season
as captain. He has been signed up by the

IN FAVOR
THIS FALL

Short,threebutton,
half-belted ulsters
are to be greatly
favored this fall.
You'll see many
of them; but none
like the Society
Brand Hampton.

The difference is in
the cut. There’s an air
about this overcoat that
you will find nowhere
else; it’s stnartly cut;
every detail—the coll of
the lapel, the spacing of
the buttons, the placing
of the pockets-isexactly
right.

Wildcat Quint Faces %?
Veteran Team Saturday

Carolina Has Team of Experienced
Stars That Will Give Red and
Black Trouble

The Davidson Wildcats will line up Sat-
urday night against the North Carolina five
in Charlotte on the Auditorium floor. The
D. C. quint goes up against a veteran team
as fast as any in the state and the resulting
game will be a real battle. Preparations for
a record crowd have been made as fans from
all over this section will turn out to see these
teams come together for the first time since
1920,

Carolina was Southern champion in 1922
and missed repeating last year by the loss of
only two games.

She has started things
with a bang this season and has already |
chalked up several wins to her credit. Mer- |
cer succumbed to the tune of 35+23 and the |
Durham B. P. O. EF. fared no better with |
a 33-20 loss. Against the strong “Y" team
of Charlotte, Carolina nosed out victors by

his usual consistent stuff. Jack Cobb, cap- ,

tain of last year’s Fresh team, pairs with
Green in the fore-court. The report has’ it
that he is delivering the goods,

Cartwright Carmichael, at center, is play-
ing up as a former captain should. His

| beautiful floor work will cause the Wildcats

as much trouble as anything new that the!
Tar Heels may uncork, |

Bill Dodder, guard, has developed, along |
with Monk McDonald, a defensive game |
that will bring out the old Wildcat fight in|
Staley and Flake Laird. Monk, another
former captain, impresses the wise guys as
being as good if not better than ever. His
strength rounds out a five that would look
mean to any club in the country.

A section for the Davidson students and
alumni is being reserved by Manager John-
nie Smith. He is also arranging for stu-|
dents’ tickets at a reduced price.

The D. C. student body plans to take in
the contest Saturday night “en masse.” The |
first and without doubt one of the hardest |

find the Davidson five backed by a whooping |
big gang fro mthe Wildcat lair. The stu-!
dents of Davidson want the team to know |
that they are behind the basketeers to a man |
and are going to show it by their attendance. |
If the Southern doesn’t have a strike, or if
the bus company doesn’t shut down, or if five
hundred pairs of strong legs don't, go weak, |
the Red and Black section of the Auditorium
will be jammed with a wild, wild bunch of
wild Wildcat rooters.

Eliminations of Present Week Will

Round Out Squad of Captain
Weem’s Boys

All advance dope on wrestling point to
the most successful season in this particular
sport of Davidson. The competitive try-outs
which are being held this week will de-
velop the first squad which is to receive spe- |
cial training in anticipation of the meet with
Carolina on the 9th of February. Under the
tutelage of Captain Weems, former star |
matman of the Army, the squad of grapplers
have developed a thorough working know!l-
edge of the scientific side of the game, which
receives too little consideration at times.

The first streak of bad luck happened
Monday afternoon when Lindamood's bear- |
like hug proved too much for one of Nor-|
man Patterson's ribs, and that particular |
article collapsed under the strain. It is!
hoped by the entire student body that this |
member of last year’s team and one of the
best contenders for this year’s honors, will
be in form to start off with the bunch that
will face Cafolina.

The series of eliminations wiff start swith
the lower classes which are more crowded
than the heavyweight divisions. While there
have not been any predictions as yet con-

Coach Rawson Develops
History-Making Squad

Yearling Team is Best Ever Turned
Out Under Red and Black

When the Wildkittens romped away with
Greensboro Hi last Friday night to the tune
of 64 to 18, Davidson awoke to a realization
of the fact that she has a bang-up Freshman
quintet. With only three practices, Coach
Rawson has perfected a machine which for

the shade.

starting the season with a stellar brand of
hall. Quick and heady at dribbling and pass
work, accurate at looping the basket, these
forwards look like varsity material. Sapp
and Simpson, at guards, present a formidable
defense. The excellent work of Sapp and
Hewlett in the Concord “Y” game 6n Sat-
urday night shows that only Freshmen in-
tercollegiate regulations are holding these
men off the varsity squad. Hudgin, at cen-
ter, plays an aggressive game, imitating the
style of “Warhoss” Mauze, of Wildcat
fame, in diving across the court after the
elusive sphere.

On the second team, a number of Fresh
McCon-
nell, Bohannon, Beall and Hunter are look-
ing well at forwards; Christian and Faw-
cette at the pivot position; and Allan, Winn
and Kiser, at guards. This team beat Cor-
nelius Hi on Friday night as a sequel to the
Greensboro game.

At the opening of the season five or six
teams of first-year men appeared in the suc-
tion-soled shoes, and Coach Rawson has his
hands full. In order to better care for all
these aspirants to positions on the first five,
two periods of practice will be held daily
for Freshmen—the second squad in the aft-
ernoon, following varsity practice; the first
squad at night. Out of this work more
varsity material will no doubt be developed
for succeeding years.

Owing to a recent faculty regulation con-
cerning Freshman games the schedule for
this season has not been completed. One
game has been definitely scheduled, however,
for February 4th, when the Trinity Fresh
will invade Wildkitten territory. Later in
the season a trip of several days is proposed,
to meet Oak Ridge Academy, Trinity Fresh,

Asheville High, and possibly Carolina
Freshmen. Several games will be played
with nearby high schools — Charlotte,

Mooresville, Statesville, Salibury, and oth-
ers. A full season is planned for the Fresh
cagers, the best Freshman team Davidson
has had in years,

Two games in a night for the Fresh.
That's not bad.

Some lad—we suppose he is from Greens-
boro—says that they are going to win the
State championship: Well, they did beat
Mooresville. ‘

Better watch Tripp, Thursday night.
Somebody might trip up yet.
hey, wot?

We make a motion that we turn Tripp
over to Sook Boggs. Any second?

Hippo the Houck is going out for the
mat sport. Did you hear Rev. Smith speak
of Hippo’s tough hide?

Hippo says wrestling is a little more
strenuous than climbing the front of West.
Somebody gave him the toothache last week.

And then “Duke” Walthall up and says
that Waynesboro H. S. girls beat somebody
135-6. What a fast bunch of girls for a
little village like that.

And then we looked in the paper and saw
the Boys’ Club of Richmond beat the Lynch-
burg Five 150-7... They claim that’s a record.

We wonder where Wallace Moore learned
to play basketball. Perhaps he took a corre-
spondence course.
