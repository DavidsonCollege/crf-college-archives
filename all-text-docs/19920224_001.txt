Students Come Out In Force For FLAG Forum

By Kevin Miller

On Wednesday, February 19,

thenewly chartered FLAG organi-

- zation held its first open forum in
the 900 room. Student Body Presi-
dent Anthony Foxx chaired a panel
that included Campus Chaplain
Chuck Hasty, FLAG president
Beth Willard, Davidson graduate
Eric Bone, ’91, and two members
of the Charlotte area chapter of
PFLAG (Parents and Friends of
Lesbians and Gays), Milt Th-
ompson and Marcia Solomon. The
panel talked with a group of some
150 Davidson students faculty and
community members, about their
personal experiences and views on
the topic of homosexuality.

Hasty opened by stating that
10% of the population of the United
States is homosexual, and that, by
the numbers, there could be as
many as 150 gay and lesbian stu-

dents on campus. “This is an
issue, something we should be
talking about,” he said.
Thompson, a father of a son
“born gay”, told his story of how at
age eight, his son showed, after
psychological testing, the possi-
bility of being gay, and by age
thirteen, homosexuality was a re-
ality. He explained how hard it

_was to learn that his son would

never be the person he hoped for.
But, he said, as his son grew, so did
he, and his love for him was never
compromised.

Today, asamember of PFLAG
and the Disciples of Christ, Th-
ompson believes that religion
everywhere has contributed to the
negativity that homosexuals face
every day. By not asserting itself
as a leader and a supporter, the
church has left many gays and
lesbians searching for a good an-

Medical Humanities
Speaker Addresses Assisted Suicide

By Jeff Oller

On Tuesday, February 18, Dr.

Velvi Greene, 2 a professor of epi-

~~ demiology ait Ben Gurion Soe
sity of Negev, Israel, gave a lecture
concerning assisted suicide as a
part of the Medical Humanities
Series.

At the beginning Greene as-
serted that he was basing his inter-
view on personal opinions drawn
from his experiences and his study
of the Jewish tradition. He then
defined assisted suicide as, “‘inten-
tional infliction without malice in
time of severe illness.”

Euthenasia is defined as the
action of killing an individual for
reasons of euthanasia, A few forms
of euthenasia that Greene cited
were a patient’s refusal of pain
killers, apatient’s decision to chose
another person to decide when the
doctor is to discontinue treatment,
a patient’s refusal of intravenous
hydration, suicide for a cause, sui-
cide for another’s preservation, and

_ apatient’s refusal of antibiotics.

Throughout his talk, Greene

insisted upon referring to assisted '

suicidé as murder, not euthenasia.
He said, “this is the age of euthana-
sia, and I’m going to make a case
against euthanasia of any kind.”
Greene pointed out that the
subject of assisted suicide has only
been a public controversy since
the 1980’s. He asserted that this is
largely in part of the fact that,
“technology allows us to consider
euthanasia as a realistic option.”
Greene, in support of his as-
sertion that he would draw greatly
upon the Jewish tradition, referred
to the Bible several times. He
cited Jonathan’s mercy killing of
Saul in the book of Judges. Jon-
athan was put to death for putting
Saul out of misery. He also re-
ferred to the three cardinal sins in
the Torah, incest, idolatry and
murder, and he referred to the
book of Genesis with its con-
demnation of assisted suicide.

swer to the “big” question on the
issue, “Is thisrightinGod’s mind?”

A student did ask Hasty what
he would do if a student posed this
question to him, and he answered
by saying, “I-would never say
whether it was right or wrong
because I don’t know that person’s
situation. I would tell them to
search their scriptures.”

Thompson also asked the au-
dience to put themselves in a gay’s
place and to think of the little things
they would have to tolerate in
almost every social situation. He
said that, as people, homosexuals
are no different than anyone else.
“Members of the band don’t dis-
criminate against the football team,
and marketing majors don’t dis-
criminate against engineering
majors. So why should gays and
lesbians be discriminated against
by straights?” he said.

Furthermore he cited a prece-
dent in Jewish law that refers the
idea that a person’s body does not
belong to himself, but instead be-
longs to God. Therefore, life can-
not be tampered with except to
preserve.

He pointed out the fact that,
“euthanasia was performed dis-
creetly.” The idea of euthanasia,
he said, arose from the desire to do
away with those that were seen as
unworthy or useless. Mental. pa-
tients, mentally retarded persons,
severely deformed or handicapped
individuals and others who were
“incapable” of contributing to so-
ciety were seen as a burden.

Greene described his deep
concern about the fact that we, asa
society, are considering allowing
doctors to euthanize those patients
who are either dying, in extreme
discomfort or have no hope of liv-
ing anormal life. Greene referred

UNC Professor Details Genetic Research

By Cindy Ebbs

Dr. John Graham, Emeritus
Professor of Pathology at UNC
Chapel Hill Medical School vis-
ited Davidson on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 19 and discussed “Using
Genetics in Clinical Research”.

Graham graduated from
Davidson in 1938, and then went
on to UNC Chapel Hill Medical
School and Cornell University for
further study. Graham, with the
help of many student interns, has
written over 185 scientific papers,
many of which are located in the
E.H, Little Library.

Credit for the appearance of
Dr. Graham goes to a student of
his, Dr. Donald L. Copeland, ’56
who now practices family medi-

cine at the Lake Norman Medical

Park.

Graham’s lecture was based
on the importance of family his-
tory in medical genetics. Through
hisclose study of the genetic family
history, Graham illustrated ex-
amples of hereditary genes.

Througha dejailed diagram of
the history of a family containing
eleven fathers and eighteen moth-
ers, Graham used Hereditary
Benign Intraepithelial Dyskerato-
sis, a condition otherwise known
as “Red Eye”, to show an example
of a simple autosomal’ dominant
trait.

Graham also determined that
the Hageman Trait and an abnor-
mal blood clotting trait are au-

‘netic family studies, that rickets

tosomal recessive traits. These
types of traits usually point to in-
breeding as acause for its appear-
ance 25% of the time, as Graham
proved through two specific fam-

Solomonexplained that shedid
not get an opportunity to see her
son as often as the normal parent
because of her divorce. Thus, when
her son told her during a visit with
him at college that he was gay, her
lifelong image of him as the nor-
mal, loving, young boy was shat-
tered. She said that the PFLAG
saying,.“‘when children come out
of the closet, parents go into the
closet,” directly applied to her.

She said that she went through
a grieving process, and that she
went through a grieving’ process
with the realization that her son
would never reproduce. But, with
the help of PFLAG, she said, and
the recognition of the “world of
hate” that surrounds her son, she
came out of her closet. Now, she
says, she is closer than ever with
her son.

Solomon said that the discrimi-

nation and cruelty towards homo-
sexuals has to stop. “By speaking
to groups, I do try to change
people’s beliefs. You can believe
what you want to believe, but you
have noright to hurt my child,” she
said.

Bone opened by saying that
when he was at Davidson there
was no way he could have possibly *
spoke out about his homosexual-
ity. He said that although hisexpe-
rience at Davidson was positive, it
was positive only because of a
greatamountofsupporthe received
from a small group of friends that
allowed him to be himself with no
fear of ridicule.

He said he received no support
from his parents when they learned
of his homosexuality during the
summer after his freshman year at

Wilson Discusses
Davidson Students
"Breaking the Barriers”

By Leslie Goff

Last Monday evening in the
900 Room, Dr. Greer Wilson, a
faculty member at University of
Virginia, lectured to a gathering of
students on the issue of tolerance.
While many students missed the
chance tohear this speaker, Wilson
presented a serious message re-
garding the breaking of: barriers
amidst our college community.

Wilson stated that Davidson is not
unique in facing such hurdles that
are currently plaguing the campus.
Other schools about which she re-
ported are Wake Forest and UVA.
Both schools are examining their
current situations as well.

Wilson began by describing
three ways colleges handle multic-

trait which is located only on the

discussed the difference between

and sub-lethal, able to be per-

philia as respective examples.
