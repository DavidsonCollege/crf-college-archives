Hours Weekly.

Monday, February 24, 1919, marked
the inauguration of the R. O. “F.C. in
Davidson College, the afternoon of this
day being spent in taking measurements

are better officers than tailors, for a few
days afterwards this work had to be re-
peated. ‘he carefulness with which
these measurements have .been taken is
due to-the desire of Lieutenant Colonel
Mueller to make each man look as neat
as possible, which is impossible with ifl-
fitting uniforms.

After consultation with the faculty,
Colonel Mueller has issued orders that
uniforms must be worn every day until
the military routine is over. “They do
not have to’ be worn on Saturday and
Sunday afternoons. When leaving the
Hill the student can wear his “cits.” and
a fact that is very pleasing to the stu-
dent bady is that this applies also to
holidays (which are so numerous that
we will not stop to count them). It
also has been decided that the drill work
shall be five hours weekly. While the
reading of the first announcement did
nat seem to displease the students, the
second one caused quite a commotion.

The task of organizing the battalion
was accomplished last “Tuesday notwith-

Company “D": Captain, W. P. Har-
ris! First Lieutenant, L. C. MecAskill;
Second Lieutenant, J. He Sample; First

‘The compantes having been organized,
orders were given for a little drill work;
which «was carried out very snappily in
spite of the athletic field being a veritable
sea of mud. The companies were then
drawn up in the form of a square to be
addressed by Colonel Mueller. In the
course of his talk he outlined the pur-
pose of the R. O. VT. C: to be to train
men to adequately meet every emergency,
and that if everyone was willing to work
there was no reason why the Davidson
Battalion should not equal that of any
Military School. Summer camps will
be held this year and quite a few of the
students have expressed a desire to at-
tend. Further particulars
this matter will be issued later.

THE U.S. MILITARY POLICY.

Among the books placed in the library
during the past week is “The Military
Policy of the United States.” written by
Maj. Gen. Emory Upton, U.S. A. This
is a valuable book and contains a great
deal of helpful information ahour the
military policies of the United States
from the first war with England up
thru the Civil War, Every man in the
R. O. T. C. should read at least a part
of the book.

The school visitor was asking the class
a few questions. “‘Now how do bees dis-
pose-bf their honey >”

“They cell it.” announced the clever
boy of the class, .
