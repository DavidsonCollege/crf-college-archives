MR. BASMAIIAN GIVES
LECTURE ON “ARMENIA”

Saturday morning. Mr. Basmajian, an
Armenian, spoke at the Davidson Graded
School. At night he gave an interesting
lecture on “Armenia” in Shearer Hall.

“Mr. Basmajian is a well informed
speaker, and lectured for some time on
the history and customs of Armenia and
Constantinople. his native city. “There
are no instruments in’ the Armenian
churches, Mr. Basmajian says, but they
are great singers. [t often requires half
an hour for them to sing five words. Mr.
Basmajian illustrated this by singing the
first syllable of one of their favorite
hymns, which took him two minutes. In
Constantinople over fifty languages are
spoken, and a man can hardly run a store
unless he has at least a smattering of
ten or fifteen different languages. Mr.
Basmajian then showed his. interesting
collection of oriental .costumes and curi-
osities. After singing a number of songs
in his native tongue, he concluded by
playing on over a_ half-dozen oriental
musical instruments.

THE AESCULAPIAN CLUB.

The Aesculapian club has been reor-
ganized and put on a more systematic
basis. A new constitution has been
adopted and plans are now under way
to make it a “live wire” on the campus.
Among the plans of the club is the fit-
ting up of a club room with the most
noteworthy medical books, magazines.
pamphlets, the requirements of different
medical colleges and things of general in-
terest to the members. The meetings are
to be semi-monthlv. At the last meeting
of the club Dr. W. S. Hall, dean of the
Medical College of Northwestern Uni-
versity; Drs. Martin and Overcash, of
Davidson, were elected honorary mem-
bers. The club has twenty-five regu-
larly enrolled members now and expects
to enroll several new men at the next
meeting, which will be held December 7.
