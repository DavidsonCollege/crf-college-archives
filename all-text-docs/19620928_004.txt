THE CRYSTAL BALL

Since last week's attempt at predicting the results of
Southern Conference outings proved to be so disastrous,
we first decided that the wisest thing to do was to dis-
continue running predictions in this column. After much
thought, however, it was decided to give it one more try.

So now, with a second hand crystal ball and a
little spiritual guidance from Sister Roberts, we again
put our neck on the chopping block.

With both Tom Worrell and Jim Fuller back in the
lineup, and with Earl Cole able to diversify the attack
with his passes, Davidson should be able to top a big
Wofford squad.

Prediction: Davidson 21, Wofford 13.

The Citadel should not find any competition from the

Presbyterian eleven, and should win handily.
Prediction: The Citadel 30, Presbyterian 6.

When Furman meets powerful Florida State, it will

suffer the same fate as did The Citadel two weekends ago.
Prediction: Florida St. 36, Furman 9.

The Richmond-VMI clash will be an interesting one.
but Richmond. with Me! Rideout, a brilliant but. erratic.

inexperience while West. Virginia has-one of the bigger
teams in the countrv. |
Prediction: West Virginia 28, VPI 7.

We see no chance for William & Mary to upset Navy |
even if they are much stronger than last year. Last week's
Joss to Virginia will be repeated.

Prédiction: Navy 26, William & Mary 7.

BOWLING CHAMPIONS YET

Fogleman seemed to think that
this year’s squad reported in

sprints.

Nevertheless, he did say,
“The team should be better
than last year’s if the boys
can get into better shape and
if we could get a kick board
for practice.” Many of the
boys have not worked out on
a kick board, and Fogleman is
having trouble replacing the
old one.

Walls Takes W. 0. W.
For Citadel Showing

“He’s a kind of guy who never gives up.” This is the

way a fellow team member

sized up the Wildcat of the

Week, Russell Walls, a junior guard.

Walls’ play in The Citadel
game, both offensive and defen-
sive, won the praise of coaches
and players alike. He played
hard and was a major factor that
the score was not worse than it
was. He also served as co-cap-
tain of that game.

Walls’ selection as W.O.W.,
however, was based as much on
the consistently good perform-
ance he puts in every game as it
was on his performance in any
one game. Too often linemen
like Walls are overlooked be-
eause their play is never as
spectacular as that of backs
and ends.

In high school Walls showed
the kind of stuff he was made
of by winning the West Virginia
State Wrestling Championship
in the 167 pound class. He was
also an All-State football player.

So when Walls lines up
against a tough opponent, you
know he’s going to play harder—
that’s just the way he is.

FOR PLEASURE, RELAXATION, GOOD TIMES,

SHARING CO-CAPTAIN HONORS tomorrow night will be Dick Vorhees (right) and Morris

Williams.

Vorhees, from Winston-Salem, N. C., is a senior and is president of the conservative club.
Williams is a junior footballer from Henderson, N. C. He also holds down better then a B

average.

Wake Forest Meet
First For Harriers

“We're going with the inten-
tion of winning,” commented
Davidson cross country coach
death Whittle on the Wildcat

harriers’ journey to Wake For-} week as flickerball action began.

‘st Wednesday.

Leading the Demon Deacons
against Coach Whittle’s forces
will be last year's number 2 man,
Z0b Dorest. In addition to Dor-
set, John Carter and Ron
Thomas head a strong letterman
contingent intent on repeating
last year’s twin victories over
Davidson.

“Sterling Martin is in better
shape now than he was last year
at this time and ought to bring
home a first”, said Coach Whit-
tle of the Wildcat captain and
All-‘Southern Conference star.
Along with Martin, sophomores
Denny Phillips, Ronnie Reese,
and Chester Davis will be the
mainstays of the Davidson team.

Davidson's freshmen will en-
counter Wake’s Baby Deacons
also on Wednesday. Steve Gill,
Andy Little, and Biil Briggs are
the Wildkittens’ top men.

Pembroke's ross country
team will be entertained Friday.
Oct. 5. in Davidson's first home
meet. This meet was postponed
from last week.

TENNIS PRACTICE

Varsity tennis practice will
be held from 1:30 to 3:30 each
afternoon. Anyone interested
in going out should see Coach
Harry Fogleman at this time.

Dole attributed the loss to
“mistakes fumbles and
missed assignments.” He said,
“We'll come around. You just
can’t win with mistakes.”

What bothered Dole the most

Scoring on The Citadel team
was mainly a one man operation

score over and kicked the ex-

kicked two insurance field goals.
