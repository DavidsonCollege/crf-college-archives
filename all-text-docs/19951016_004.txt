DC sponsoring, building Habitat House

By Sarayn J. DAMANTI
College Relations

A committee of students and
staff met last Tuesday evening to
plan how people on this campus
can do the same thing for another
family. The new “Habitat House
Committee,” chaired by Smita
Donthamsetty and service coordi-
nator Catherine Turner, accepted
the ambitious task of raising
$30,000-$40,000 and completing
construction of a Habitat house
here in Davidson by the end of the
school year.

The home will be constructed
on Potts Street, which is justa five-
minute walk from campus across
the railroad tracks from Town Hall.
Habitat has built 11 other homes
there since a chapter was founded
here in 1988. The family who will
live in the home will be selected
through the Our Towns Habitat
chapter, which builds homes in

Mooresville, Davidson, Cornelius
and Huntersville.

Families are accepted to re-
ceive Habitat homes on the basis
of their poor or overcrowded liv-
ing conditions, ability to handle
financial matters, stable job his-
tory and lack of a criminal record.
They must also subscribe to the
Habitat concept by working on their
home and other Habitat homes for
300 hours.

By using volunteer labor and
as much donated material as pos-
sible, Habitat can build a three
bedroom, two bath home for about
$30,000. It is even more afford-
able to homeowners because they
buy it from Habitat through a 20-
year, no-interest mortgage. Most
end up paying less to own a home
than they were paying in rent, since
their monthly mortgage payment
is about $225, including escrow
fees.

Habitat believes that home

Boyd makes a
speedy recovery

After donating bone marrow
on September 29, junior Brian
Boyd bounced right back into ac-
tion. Afterall, “I needed to go back
to class. I had a paper due on
Monday.’ The operation to retrieve
bone marrow takes 45-90 minutes
on average.

Because Brian’s blood mar-
row was “exceptionally dilute,” it
took his doctors about two-and-a-
half hours to finish the surgery.

Brian felt serious pain for
about 20 minutes after waking up.
As he explained, however, “that
was only because I didn’t ask for
the pain reliever. That was stu-
pid!”

After that period, he felt “just
uncomfortable” at worst.

Brian left the hospital at 6
p.m. that evening and went back to
a friend’s room to watch a movie.
By Monday, his life went back to
business as usual.

He spent his fall break with a
visiting friend, “sitting around here
and vegging out.”

Cautiously optimistic, Brian
will soon be able to communicate
through anonymous letters with
his recipient.

He knows now that she is di-
vorced with three children. In his
letters, he must be careful not to
reveal where or who he is.

In about a month, Brian will
know whether or not her transplant
was successfully received.

ownership builds community by
giving families a sense of pride
and a stake in the community’s
welfare.

The Davidson Habitat com-
mittee plans to meet every other
Monday to maintain impetus for
the project. ;

“IT am very excited about the
project,” said publicity co-chair
Sandy Neblett. “It is potentially a
very unifying project. It will be
one of the first projects where the
whole campus is involved.”

Everyone is encouraged to
become involved in the event, and
many groups have already agreed
to help with fund raising. On Oc-
tober 21 Kappa Sigma fraternity
and Rusk eating house will spon-
sor ‘‘Homeruns for Habitat,” a soft-
ball tournament which will raise
funds through pledges and sale of
t-shirts.

Other fundraising activities
will include the student talent show,

Rainy days and Mondays.

FLAG fashion show and the offer-
ings taken up during the Chapel
Committee’s Christmas Vespers.
The Habitat House Committee will
also consider events such as con-
certs and parties.

So far, $270 have been placed
into the treasury. Treasurer Will-
iam Brown, director of the College
Union, is very optimistic about the
project. “I think it’s exciting, and
it’s definitely going to happen,” he
said.

Turner added, “Ifeveryone on
campus gave only $20 to the cause,
we would have enough money,”
she said. “That is not a lot of funds
per person when it will be used to
build new and better lives.”

Volunteer coordinator co-
chair and Bonner Scholars pro-
gram director Katherine Cooke said
there will be many opportunities
for student involvement in the
project. “Though students have
helped, on other Habitat houses,

this is the first time in Davidson
that a house will be built solely by
college students,” she said. “We
will need lots of help with the
building as well as volunteer sup-
port to bring food and drinks for
the workers.”

The foundation for the house
will be poured before Christmas,
and construction will proceed after
winter break. Construction is ten-
tatively scheduled for Thursdays
and Saturdays.

Anyone who wants to volun-
teer, groups who would like to
work with the project, or any per-
son who has ideas about fund rais-
ing or other aspects of the event
should contact Donthamsetty at
x6730 or Turner at x2460.

Habitat for Humanity has
helped more than 40,000 families
across the US to break out of the
poverty cycle by achieving the
American dream of home owner-
ship.

In observance of National De-
pression Screening Day, the Stu-

* dent Health Center hosted a semi-

nar Thursday night to promote edu-
cation and awareness of depres-
sion. The seminar included speak-
ers, panelists, and the movie Ordi-

nary People.

College counselor DeWitt
Crosby and Dr. Coal Barton, a
member of the psychology depart-
ment, opened the evening with a
discussion about the signs and
causes of clinical depression. Dr.
Barton mentioned that “depression
becomes a pervasive mood that

_colors your perspective.” He indi-

cated that depression is primarily a
disorder associated with distortions
of reality and behavior.

Crosby concluded the night
on an optimistic note, saying that
“depression is a hopeful disease,
the most treatable of mental ill-
nesses, [since] 90 percent of those
who experience depression get
well.”
