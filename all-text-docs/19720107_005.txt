LETTERS TO THE EDI TOR

EDITOR'S NOTE: In view of

the importance of the allega-
tions which Bill Smith presents
in his letter, THE DAVIDSON.
1AN askea several parties in-
volved in the incident for cor-
roboration of details. Parlia-
mentarian Todd Eades stated
that while Peeples was upset
with the decision and tet it be
known, “he did not curse wild-
ly.”

As the editors we would also
like to express our position on
these letters. In accordance

with the policy of the newspa-
per we have published these
letters aince they have met our
criteria in that they are signed
and are not libelous.

We resent the submission of
the letters as taking unfair ad-
vantage of the newspaper in
submitting materials which are
more appropriatety political an-
nouncements.

To The Editor:

With the upcoming SGA pres.
idential election, I feel the urg-

ency to point out a distinction
I see between the candidates.

A circumstance which dis
tinctly portrays what I consider
19 be an important difference
between Alexander and Peeples
occurred at a senate meeting
this fall. The scene was cre-
ated when Peeples began lo
curse wildly at SGA President
Clodfelter and parliamentary
procedure consultants Eades
and ‘Meier over a ruling they
had made to disallow a proxy
voie.

On Plight Of Social Life

In response to the well or.
ganized and expressive letter
written by Phil Fleming which
appeared in the issue of Decem-
ber 17, I have several things
To say.

Phil, it was not always this
way. As recently as last year,
foreign exchange students were
assigned to fraternities here at
Davidson. In Phi Delta Theta
we had a very outstanding guy
from Holland, Rene Castelein.

He never needed the closed
relationship of a foreign clique.
And I seriously doubt that you
would either had a change in
the system not occurred.

Also, Phil, it has not always
been that freshmen withdraw
trum Davidson like frogs jump-
ing off logs. The underlying
reason is, so they say, coeduca-
tion or lack of it.

But, would you believe that
at this point in the school year,
fieshmen in the past would al-

ready be in fraternities if they
chose.

In fraternities the freshmen
can find upperclassmen who are
well-adjusted and interested
enough to get them into a so-
cial life they can enjoy, a social
life which includes females. (I
shudder to think what my fresh-
man year would have been like
had if not been for the upper-
classmen | knew.)

On the fraternity court the
treshman can rid himself of
the Todd Hobbies who sit in
the union minding their own
business as they write editorials
about pledge pins and criticize
Davidson for what it has not
done for them.

It would seem that this new
social system (ironic that so-
cial system has the same in-
itials as its instigators!) is go-
ing to work, Phil. But how is it
going to work? In answering
that | shall direct my words
to Sam Spencer.

“Merry Christmas! Ho! Ho! Ho!”

if)

By the time the Davidson
dropouts’ places are filled and
by the time the Admissions Of-
fice is able to ‘fill the freshman
quota from the pathetically low
number of applicants, the cali-
bre of person at Davidson will
be tne type with which previous
graduates and soon-to-be grad-
uates will be ashamed to iden.
tify:

With coeducation coming in
by leaps and bounds, it won't
be long before the girls will see
that the men at Davidson are
not what they expected, and
history will repeat itself with
the female situation.

President Spencer, the ben-
efits of your actions reached a
peak long ago. Your purpose
has been fulfilled and overshot.
You need to reverse your field
soon before we all find David-
son on the short end of the
score.

While I gan understand Ralph's

rejection of the ruling, I can
in no way condone or even
passively accept such a reac-
tion to a fair and legitimate de.
cision.

In other senate meetings.
Alexander has also faced un.
favorable and disagreeable de-
cisions, but, to my knowledge.
he has never conducted himself
in any other way than with
composure and respect for his
fellow senate members.

To The Editor:

Last summer while I was in
Washington 1 visited Senator
Jordan’s office. Jordan is the
Senator from North Carolina. I
told the office that I was at-
tending Davidson next fall and
just decided to drop in to sav
hello.

The office told me, to my
Surprise. that a student from
Davidson was on the Senator's
staff. That student was Bill
Alexander.

The office of SGA President
must be filled by a person who
is experienced in government.
Bill Alexander has fulfilled this
qualification not only in Wash-
ington, but by his work right
here in Davidson.

‘Last Picture Show’ Views
‘Peyton Place Out West’

A REVIEW
By JACE GAFFNEY

Peter Bogdanovich’s The Last
Picture Show is a_black-and-
white film. and its first scene.
framed in lcng shot. is of the
courthouse square of a dusty,
desolate Texas town. The cam-
era then pans slightly until we
see the ‘“‘picture house” (movie
theatre).

Bogdanovich's opening scene
is startling in its conventiona-
lity. Black-and-white photogra-
phy. simple camera placement
and movement, and the dusti-
ness seem to have been manu-
tactured by ghostly (ghastly?)
wind machines discarded from
some ancient Hollywood set.

There is something square
about it all, not Campy square.
but honest square. The scene
firmly places the audience in
a real-life setting, but it also
creates a peculiar, ominous.
type resonance.

There is something conven.
tional about the subject matter,
too. for this is the hot, barren,
sex-strangulated Southwest of
the early 1950's, home of Hud
and not too distant neighbor of
the hothouse workings of Ten-
nessee Williams and William
Inge.

The film focuses on the young
people of the town, in particular
the boys, Sonny Crawford (Tim-
othy Bottoms) and his buddy
Duane (Jeff Briger), their strug-
gle to grow up as men, and
their futile attempts to escape
the boredom of their lives.

The avenues of escape are a

pool hall and ‘'picture show’
house, both owned by Sam the
Lion (Ben Johnson), the only
father-image to be found ir
town. and SEX.

This is that special kind of
sex — adolescent sex, raunchy.
callous, stupid sex, for the most

It is the same kind of sex prae-.

loneliness and ennui.

ers. They have the same prob
‘ems and they sometimes act as
inhumanly towards one another.
But director Bogdanovich and
scenarist Carry McMurtry re.
fuse to treat or characterize
them as such.

Whereas a director of less
taste and restraint would sen-
Sationalize every sexual indis-
cretion, Bogdanovich directs his
players in the same manner
with which he opened his pic-
ture — squarely, honestly. He
doesn’t play things ‘up: he plays
them out.

The stereotype characters
take on a very tragic form of:
humanity as they desperately
wresile with their own hapless
lives. Never does Bogdanovich
get derisive: never does he ex-
