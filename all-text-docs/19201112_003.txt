DK. WINFIELD SCOTT HALL
SPEAKS TO STUDENTS

Dr. Winifield Scott Hall entertained

, the student body during assembly hour
gs last Tuesday with a learned discourse

upon temperance and the moral welfare
of young men. He presented his subject

in a most interesting way, choosing il-
lustrations from life as he has known
others to have experienced it. He clear-
ly set forth the way to success for those
who are apparently doomed to be vic-
tims of a dusty death.

Dr. Hall has made a deep study of his
subject both at home and abroad. He
was for 23 years a member of The Med-
ical Faculty of Northwestern University
Medical School, at Chicago. He has re-
cently resigned all forms of active med-
ical teaching to take up a nation-wide
work in social reconstruction.

SIGMA UPSILON.

The Sigma Upsilon held its meeting
Wednesday night in the Bachelor's
Club hall. The second chapter of the
continued novel being written by the
Blue Pencils in rotation, was rendered
in remarkable style by C. H. Long, who
led the beautiful heroine thru romance
and adventure, from the Grand Canyon
to Hawaii. C. J. Matthews next read an
anonymous poem. The first part of a
short story read by Joe Walker, left the
hearers in suspense, and impatient for
the next meeting, when the story will be
finished. After a short business meet-
ing, wherein it was decided to have an
informal reception for Dr. J. Calvin Met-
calf upon his arrival, the meeting was
adjourned.

“Y” DEPUTATION WORK
STARTS WITH CHARLOTTE

Dick and Roberts Make Talks to
Queen City Boys.

Last Sunday afternoon Leonard Dick
and Dave Roberts held an evangelistic
service at the Boys’ Meeting of the
Charlotte Y. M. C. A. Dick, speaking
first, told of the importance of clean,
pure, honest living, drawing illustrations
from incidents that come up in athelet-
ics. Roberts then spoke of Jesus Christ
as a man and as a friend and challenged
the young men to cease their indiffer-
ence on religious matters and to accept
Christ whole-heartedly and form a vital
personal friendship with Him.

The party ,including C. J. Matthews,
John M. Dunlap, “Friend” Wilson, '20,
and McDowell Richards, went down to
Charlotte in a car Sunday afternoon.
They took supper with friends after the
service and returned to the campus that
night.

This is only one of a series of evan-
gelistic deputations which the Y. M. C.
A. is planning to carry out. Joe Walker
and McDowell Richards are to speak to
the Winston Y. M. C. A. Sunday, and
more dates are being arranged with
other towns. Later in the year the
Y. M. C. A. plans to conduct regular
evangelistic campaigns in some of the
prep schools near by.
