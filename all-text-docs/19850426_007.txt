Friday, April 26, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

usic, Sun, Fun, Frisbee, And Friends

It’s spring...Contagiously warm sun-
shine drove almost the entire Davidson
Community outside to celebrate good
music, good food, and good weather.

This past weekend the Davidsor Col-
lege Union gave students more reason to be
outside than mere tanning. Friday afternoon
all relaxed to the reggae sounds of the
Awareness Art Ensemble on Richardson
Field. Free beverages and frisbee flying
added to the occassion and even a hackey-
sack or two was lazily batted about

Eating houses and fraternities formally
joined the party Friday night. Fancy din-
ners, wild carousing, and crowded hot tubs
kept the revelry going.

Jazz specialist Fred Storie and Flight
108 set the mood Saturday night behind the
Commons. After the music, free pizza and
soda were provided, and then the games
began... Students excelled at everything
from pie-eating to seed spitting and from
egg-tossing to betting on the winning rat.
Wilson Lowery’'s cartoons were a big hit, as
was simply working on that tan. There were
frisbees, kites, an SAE waterslide, an.!
even a hot air balloon. But the merry-mak
ing didn’t stop at sundown.

The rocking sounds of Powerplay elec
trified the Commons Saturday night. The
traditional dance was then followed by the
traditional and, delicious breakfast in the
900 Room to the marvelous tunes of Bobby
Houck.

Many thanks go to the Union for mak-
ing this delightful ritual such a success, and
special appreciation also goes to those stu-
dents and administrators who personally
did so much.
