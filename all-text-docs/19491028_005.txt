Score of 28-7 in Homecoming Game

By WOODY McKAY

Mother nature blessed Davidson's
with a dry field and
comparatively clear sky, but the
Richmond Spiders put a damper on
the celebration of .the occasion by
handing the Wildcats a decisive
beating to the tune of 28-7.

Davidson took advastage of a
break near the middle of the second
quarter, cashed it in for the

ered it for the Wildcats on the

the score. Cliff Turner, who had

the end zone for the touchdown.
Mapes’ attempt for the extra point
split the uprights and the score

moved to Davidson 7, Richmond 0.

Early in the second period, Rich-
mond’s Billingsley went into action
along with the rest of the team
and kept up a sustained drive into
Davidson territory. A completed
forward pass from Billingsley to
Charlie Kelley carried the ball
down to Davidson’s two-yard line.
Purinai failed to score on two line
bucks, but Ferris drove over on
third down and put Richmond only
one point behind. The attempt for
the extra point was no good, and
Davidson's hopes were still high.
However, these hopes were not
long lived. Billingsley again showed
his passifg prowess by putting a
twenty-four-yard pass in the aris
of Hensley, who wrestled the ball
away from Jake Wade for Rich-

mond’s second score. Billingsley’s

attempt at the placement was again

no good and the Spiders led 12
to 7.

Before the second quarter was
over, the Richmond aerial attack
clicked again to reach paydirt with
a pass from Hensley to Ferris
which covered 54 yards. The try
for the extra point again failed,
and Richmond led 18-7 at half-time.

The Spiders hard-charging line
continued to break through the
Wildcats line and made passing
véry difficult. In the third quarter,
Lambeth was downed by John
Reynolds and Newhouse of Rich-

mond while atempting to pass from

his own end zone. This being a

safety, Richmond two

Even more significant is the
effect of the program upon the
highest 10 percent of the class. A

total of one-fourth of this 10 per-
cent would not be in Davidson Col-
lege today were it not for the schol-
arships, This includes three of the
first five men in the class. In addi-
tion, there are other excellent men
who were first attracted to David-
son by the scholarship competition,
and who have managed to enter the
college in spite of the fact that
they were not among the scholar
ship winners.

These are the figures for just
one class. If the program can be
administered with equal success in
the future, and the Committee be-
lieves that it can, its accumulative
effect wpon the quality of the stu.
dent body over a college genera-
tion should be of great importance

to the development of Davidson
College.
