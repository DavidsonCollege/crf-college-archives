‘been holding secret practices for the past

Here we are, folks, outside the big tent of
the greatest show on earth, Bunyan and
Beatty, where the first act in the Big Five
ring exhibition is about to begin. Even now
we can hear the Davidson Wildcats, the
wildest wildcats known to man, growling
for meat, but to no avail, for they will not
be fed until the whistle blows for the open-
ing act of the Big Five Circus on Satur-
day.

But let us take a look at those famed
wildcats and-the two premier wildcat tam-
ers, Monk Younger and Tex Tilson. As
usual, Monk seems to see no hope beyond
the grave for his team, but upon close ob-
servation we find that he is building an un-
usually strong line and has developed at
least one good backfield combination. We
admit that he is lacking in reserve power,
especially inthe backfield, but we cannot
help but believe that his second choice men
will come through in a big way. Then, too,
since the adoption of the shift, an optimistic
spirit seems to have developed, and with it,
a rise in Wildcat stock.

Shifting our focus to the center ring of
the Big Five, we find Wallace Wade, famous
Alabama coach, giving the works to Dook’s
Blue Devils. Mr. Wade has put out many
an outstanding team in his day, and is par-
ticularly noted for building strong lines. Al-
ready it is reported that the Devils have a
strong line, and if the whole team is as good
as some Duke alumni say it will be—well,
look out Carolina.

But hark. The sound of Tar Heel voices
reaches us, and the loudest of all is that of
Chuck Collins lifted in a ery of dismay be-
cause half his men “hardly know the sig-
Poor Carolina! She does have the
worst Iuck. And on of all that, is a
schedule including six conference games in
Saturdays. S’a fanny thing about
Collins. Always erying about what a sorry
team he has, and then about two-
thirds of the season’s games.

nals.”

Another new face in Southern coaching
circles is that of Clipper Smith at N. C.
State who makes his debut before North
Carolina fans this fall. Smith has a good
reputation up north and will doubtless build
a strong team for the Wolfpack. He has

week, so very little is known of what kind
of team he has, except that his first and
second teams are reported to be of almost

equal calibre.

Finally, on the eastern side of the big
tent in ring number five we find Pat Miller
and his Demon Deacons. Again a heavy line
seems to be the main point of interest.
Wake-Forest opens up with Carolina on
the week-end following the Davidson-Elon
game, and if Mr. Miller has the team he had
last year, those Tar Heels will have a tough
time.

Well, there you are. Five teams. Take
your pick. Battle for the Big Five champion-
ship will soon be under way. Get your
tickets for the Wild West show at the

treasurer’s office.

It is an obvious fact that the ’Cats have
a hard row to plough this season because of
the lack of reserves, but with their share
of the breaks and barring unexpected de-
yelopments, a successful season should re-

sult.

Davidson Attack to
Feature New Shift

Davidson's 1931 edition of the Wildcats will
use a shift in their attack on the gridiron. This
new style of play will replace the old set
formation style which has been employed here
for many years.

It is the first time “Monk” Younger and Tex
Tilson have tried the shift in their formations,
and from all indications Davidson’s attack will
be entirely revolutionized.

Development and perfection of this new style
of play has been by far the most important
feature of the first ten days of practice on the

Coaches Plan to Appoint Captain For
Each Game

Few major college football teams in the coun-
try are without a captain at this stage of the
but this is just the case at Davidson.
The Wildcats will open their season this Satur-
day with Elon, and as yet no captain has been
evlected.

season,

Walter Fraley captained the Wildcats through
their 1930 schedule. He was chosen by mem-
bers of the 1929 team to lead the Davidson
gridiron team, but at the end of the last season
members of the coaching staff wondered if a
plan of appointing a different player for each
game could not be worked out successfully. And
with this idea in view Davidson does not yet
have a captain for its football team.

Coach Younger announced that the staff was
still undecided just whether a permanent cap-
tain or a different captain for each game was
to be the plan. However, if the latter is to be
the custom, Coach “Monk” will undoubtedly
make his selections from members of the team

who are Seniors in the college. This group in-

cludes Don King, Don McQueen, Mick Brad-
shaw, Bud Raker, Steve Brown, and Doc
Mathis.

Playing with Bost were Miss Elizabeth Kirk,
of Laneaster, S. C.; Vernon Stuart and Teddy
Muchachos, both of Davidson. Miss Kirk dealt,
and Bost, who had the first bid, opened with
seven spades. It developed that he closed the
bidding. Silence reigned for some moments while
each member of the party glanced at one an-
other in consternation, It finally occurred to
Miss Kirk that perhaps he held 13 spades, and
asked that question. “Yes, I have them,”
said Bost, and spread before their
amazed eyes the perfect hand.

“T could harly believe I held 13 spades,”
“and searched around among all those

WILDCATS MEET
ELON SATURDAY

CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM
HOLDS FIRST MEETING ©

The members of the 1931 fall cross-country
team had their first meeting last Monday aft-
ernoon. Under the direction of Captain Pritchett

and “Pete” Whittle, the team is getting into
shape for the first of their four meets this
fall.

The Davidson cross-country team this year
meets South Carolina, Duke, V. P. L, and an-
other team which has not been settled upon
yet. The Duke meet is to be held here on
Home-Coming Day, October 17, The varsity

team will probably be built up around Brannon,
Earle, Morrow, Woodside, and Drake. Bran-
non and Earle both did work last year on the
varsity. The last three, Morrow, Woodside ard
Drake, ran on the Fresh squad last year. This
year’s Fresh team has not been organized tong
enough to tell much about the prospects.
