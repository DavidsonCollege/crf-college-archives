A MODERN PARABLE
There was a friend of ours who

lived in a particulary densely popu-
lated section of Brooklyn. Now this

man was intelligent and well-in-
formed—so well informed that he
came down with a disease com-

mon to our times: bombphobia. He
would lie awake nights in his hot
Heooklyn apartment and while he
was not bordering on hysteria, his
thoughts would go something like
this: “Well, if they come over and

At-most schools fraternity and
sorority rushing is the event of the
day about this time of year. Of
course, we at Davidson know that
this practice arises from gross
ignorance on the part of the ad-

ministration of other colleges. The
greatest majority of colleges have
not learned the trick of thrusting
fraternities at a freshman before
he finds out that he is not in, bed-
lam or, Penn Station at the rush
houge We evidently fail to show
a crscst to the degree that
the powers-that-be feel that we are
unable to regulate our personal
schedules to allow for a rush pro-
