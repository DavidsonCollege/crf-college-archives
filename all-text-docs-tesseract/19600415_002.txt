THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, APRIL v. 1960

(All Unsigned Editorials oy the Editor)

A General Prospectus

THE DAVIDSONIAN has changed
hands for third time since April
1, 1959, and each change has resulted
in different. and often conflicting,
editorial policies. We will not attempt
to lay out a platform itemizing our
editorial projects for 1960-61. Instead,
we present here a rather general,
overall view of our editorial plans.

Four men, including the Editor, his
assistant, and two Associate editors
will make up the editorial staff. We
hope that from this group, broader
range of opinion will emerge—that
the editorial columns will not be the
fruit of one man’s thoughts.

We feel that we can accomplish
nothing by warming over old argu-
ments on the integration-segregation

issue. We feel, however, that free dis-

cussion of the problem is necessary
to its solution. We will not hesitate to
take a stand when new developments
arise.

‘Our attitude is much the same to-
ward athletic policy. We will state
our position and stick by it, but we
see no need to harp on it for the rest
of the semester.

We feel that there are several is-
sues which should not be discussed
in these columns until they have been
carefully researched. The reader of-
ten gets mere opinion rather than

Statistics for proof, and concrete sug-
gestions for action. The enlarged edi-,
torial staff can more easily handle the
carefully studied editorial and its
background material. This spring we
hope to give thorough study to the
quality of chapel programs and the
possibility of either improving, or cut-
ting down on the number of exercises
per week. Later we will present our
findings and conclusions on the ques-
tion of comprehensive examinations.
We will investigate the present re-
quirements for the basic ROTC
course. Should freshmen who are not
eligible for the advanced program be
forced to spend two years taking the
basic course?

We feel that a key issue this year
is the student council. Having reached
a sort of passive crisis, it can only
strengthen itself; it must expand its
sphere of influence. If it maintains
the status quo, it might as well cease
to exist.

THE DAVIDSONIAN will continue
to be a crusading newspaper; a news-
paper that doesn’t campaign for what
it believes isn’t worth its salt. But we
will remember that this is a news-
paper, not a propaganda sheet. We
will limit our crusades to the editorial
page and leave-the rest to the news.

The Bastard Amendment

Last week, in what was his last
major, official action as President of
the Student Body, Dee Green passed
his election amendment. It all began
back in the spring of 59, when prac-
tically the same amendment, calling
for a more streamlined election pro-
cedure, was passed the saine day
Green took office. Unfortunately,
there was a small oversight, and
amendment No. One was omitted
from the constitution. It might be in-
teresting to note that the Honor
Court, which has been trying cases
for a year, was also omitted from
Green's personal copy of the consti-
tution.

So Green drew up amendment No.
Two and introduced it in chapel. It

was to be voted on during chapel on
Friday, March 25. There .was no
chapel that day. The bastard amend-

‘ment finally found its way into the

fraternity houses last Friday night—
when the elections were halfway fin-
ished. Amendment No. Two passed
by a wide margin.

And there was an injustice, too. A
hundred Independents, who are rep-
resented on the Student Council (new
president) and even have a non-voting
seat in the IFC, were not given bal-
lots. Well, they probably would have
voted against it anyway.

It was an ordeal, and Dee Green is
glad it’s over.
So are we.

Not An Endorsement ...

A fascinating little behind-the-
scenes drama ended this week with
the announcement that the YMCA,
not Westminster Fellowship, -will
sponsor the long-postponed lunch
counter sit-down forum Tuesday eve-
ning in the Union Ballroom. vo

Why not Westminster Fellowship?

The session of the College Church, -

fearing that the planned WF program
might be construed as an endorse-
ment of the-sit-downs, denied WF the
use of the student lounge of the
church. Despite the students’ assur-
ance that the program was to be an
inquiry, not an endorsement, the cau-
tious session vetoed the meeting.

Now Davidson's staid Presbyterian
Church is assured that no students
will use its facilities to undermine The
Southern Way of Life. The Church is
free of subversive taint.

Or is it?

When last year a Catholic priest
appeared before WF to discuss his
faith, the meeting was held in the
student lounge. Is this not to be con-
Strued as an endorsement of Roman-
ism and its evils? Is this not enough
to inspire dark fears of popery among
Protestants?

Later in the year a Unitarian minis-
ter spoke to WF —- in the student

lounge. Unitarians, it is well-known,
have a tendency to free thought, and
many of them sniff at The Doctrine
of the Trinity. Was the WF program
a subtle endorsement of such here-
sies? Why else would good Presbyter-
ian boys sponsor such a meeting?

“We suggest that Westminster Fel-
lowship in producing such programs
is not promoting heresy but seeking
knowledge. And perhaps. the appear-
ance of Johnson C. Smith students at
a WF meeting is not so much an ef-
fort to Mongrelize the White. Race as
to give all students an opportunity to
hear varied opinions on one of the
hottest issues of the day.

‘We deplore the action of the ses-
Sion.

It smacks of fear.

It indicates a regrettable tendency
of the church to stay on the safest
side of all controversy — something
its Founder never did.

It suggests that the church—even
in the academic community—is un-
comfortable with the free search for
knowledge.

Worst of all, the session action re-
veals that the church is guarding its
Public Image—and this is a form of
idolatry all-too-prevalent here at Dav-
idson. E.S.D.

THE STUDENT SOLDIER: I!
Adams: We’re Training The “Unbeatable Generation”

(Editor’s Note: This is the
second in a series of four
articles on Military Training
at Davidson.)

By ERVIN DUGGAN
Devidsonien Associate Editor

The Protessor of Military
Seience and Tactics reached in-
to his desk drawer and fished
out a pink slip of paper.

“I copied this down,” he said,
grinning. “I collect little things
‘out of newspapers and maga-
zines, and I think this expresses
our feelings about ROTC pretty
well.

“John Mason Brown told the
boys at Groton in a commence
ment address that they must
‘earn the right to be the un-
beatable generation. That’s
what we’re trying to do here at
Davidson.”

PHILOSOPHY

Colonel Bill Adams was dis-
cussing a question put by the
DAVIDSONIAN: What is the
“philosophy of education” of
the ROTC department — and

how does it relate to the role
of the liberal arts college?

DUAL MISSION

“We've got a dual mission
charged by Congress —/to pro-
vide junior army officers and
to promote intelligent, respon-
sible citizenship. In wartime, of
course, the first takes priority;
in peacetime, the other. Now
we're stressing the second goal
here,”

NO CONFLICT

He leaned forward, glancing
at some papers on his desk.

“‘T've looked up a definition
of some words Iike ‘liberal,’
‘college’, and ‘liberal arts’, to
refresh my memory so I won't
distort the purpose ‘of liberal
education. And I don’t see any
conflict between our goals and
the liberal arts goals.

AND NO PLUMBERS

“I've been reading Whitney
Griswold’s book on liberal arts
education, and as I interpret it,
liberal education isn’t an end in

itself—but it’s not to make
plumbers, either.

“It's a preparation for living
—equiping students to deal with
the life they'll llve, In an ideal
situation, where there were no
drafts, nothing forced on us,
ROTC wouldn't fit. But where
you're in a world situation like
ours, you’ve got to deal with
the problem.

IT’S IMPORTANT

“1 think ROTC's an important
thing. We need it. It’s equip-
ping the student for something
he must face—military service.

“You take a boy coming
through Davidson. What's the
best thing for him? He must
face military service. Isn’t it
best for the country that he be
put where he can do the best
for himself and his country?”

ROTC CHANGES

The colonel paused.

We asked about the new
ROTC curriculum changes. Are
they designed to bring ROTC

The Great Easter Bunny Scandal:
“ABC” Shoots Down On Cappie

ONLY IN DAVIDSON

By BILL ARMSTRONG

Once upon a time, there lived a lit{te woman who was beloved by everyone.
Her name was Cappie and she sold beer. Her little house by the side of the road
opened its doors to all weary travelers. Here men of all sections of the country
gathered to discuss great issues and enjoy the friendship and hospitality of the

kind little woman.
A WISE MOTHER

To the homeless, Cappie was
a mother, wise with understand-
ing. To the friendless, Cappie
was a companion, compassion-
ate and believing. To the weak,
Cappie was strength: to the
Strong she was a guiding force.

Cappie was all things to all
men. She was a living example
of the Declaration of Indepen-
dence; for in Cappie was indeed
life, liberty, and above all, the
pursuit of happiness.

To Cappie, all weary travel-
ers became “my boys”. She
mothered them as no real moth-
er would have done. She never
complained when they put their
feet on the furniture. She was
always ready with a cold beer
when they came in hot and
tired.

“ACTIVE” BOYS

At times, “Cappie’s boys” be-
came a little too rambunctious.
In their enthusiasm, they would
pile obstacles in the road so
that other travelers would have
to turn from the beaten path
and meet their beloved Cappie.

And if the traveler insisted
upon traveling the lonely road,
then they would good naturedly
throw a few beer cans after him
—to speed him on his journey.

But it was this harmless and
well-intended play that caused
the black shadow to be cast
over the happy abode of Cap-
pie's. For one night in April,
just before Easter, there hop-
ped through the door of Cap.
pic’s, a rabbit.

DANDRUFFY TAIL

He was an old rabbit, his nose
was red, his eyes bleary and
blood-shot, and his teil had

dandruff, but ho possessed

enough dignity to cause the
“boys” to become silent as he
limped painfully across the
floor.

With a great effort, the rab-
bit hopped up on the bar and
turned toward Cappie. Looking
her in the eye, the rabbit shook
his head solemnly and _ said,
“I'm sorry, but I must prohibit
you from selling beer from
henceforth and for ever more.”

The “boys” were too shocked
fo speak, but Cappie calmly
asked the rabbit, “Why? What
have I done? My boys haven't
bothered a single person.”

ANIMALS COMPLAIN

“You don’t understand,” the
rabbit said. “It’s not the people
who are complaining, it’s the
animals, Not far from here are
some busy old hens who claim
that the beer cans you throw
beside the road are bothering
them in their pursuit of worms.

“And three old jackasses
have complained that they have
to pull the cars back on the
road after you have run them
off with your obstacles.

“But the worst offense is to
the rabbits,” and here the poor
old rabbit gazed fearlessly
around the room. “The male
rabbits of this area have gotten
into the habit of licking the
beer cans which you throw and

95% of the male rabbit popula-
tion to become alcoholic.

ABC STEPS IN

“Now with Easter only days
away, there is no one to paint
the eggs and carry the goodies
but a bunch of sotted rabbits.
And so, as a member of the
ABC—Alcoholic Bunny Control
—I must ask you to please
leave, peacefully.”

“And if we won't leave,

questioned.

“Then I must use force,” the
rabbit replied, and he glanced
toward the door. There; just in-
side the room, stood six skunks,
their tails noised, their meaning
all too clear.

Within twenty minutes Cap-
pie found herself alone. The old
rabbit was the only one left.

WHAT NOW?

“What shall I do now?” Cap-
pie moaned to the rabbit. “I’m
lost without my boys.”

“Perhaps,” the rabbit replied,
“there will be another chance
when your boys learn to keep
their cans inside. But who can
tell? Only one thing do I know.
You must remember to always
be very careful when you are
dealing with old hens and
skunks and jackasses.”

And the old rabbit jumped

pile outside, This has causedfrom the bar and was gone.

closer to the liberal arts?

He grinned again.

“Yes, and I'm charmed with
the new program. Of course, we
can’t claim credit for all of this. |
The college had been asked for
its views by the national ROTC
Board — made up of college
presidents — about a plan like
this.

D. C. AHEAD

“But Davidson has always
been way ahead, just like when
we went to three hours of in-
struction a, week instead of
four. :

“We feel that to keep on a
high level of instruction here
we must avoid pure mechanics
—make the whole course more
intellectually challenging.”

“Our big clearance has al-
ready come. And this does a
lot of fine things. You used to
graduate with twenty hours of
ROTC. Now you have fourteen
hours of ROTC and six hours
of academic courses for which
we give ROTC credit,

“Without hurting the ROTC
student we've opened up six.
hours of credit for courses he
may ‘want.

NO FLAG-WAVING

‘Y’m sold on Davidson, and I
think ROTC’s valuable. We're
not waving flags or anything —
but we're a patriotic people and
we're interested in doing what's
best for the boy and for the
country.”

THE PROMISE OF TOMORROW

MECHANICAL FACULTY TRIES
WAYWARD BROTHER'S CRIME

@v KNOX ABERNETHY

(Editor’s Note: The following article was submitted recently
to Sigma Upsiton, honorary literary fraternity. i is reprinted
here, not as 8 reflection of any ediortial views, but as humorous

fletion.)

A mechanical band switched on the power, and the
Faculty lighted up. An ancient ceremonial pipe was
plugged into a socket in each of the electronic brains,
and they began puffing blue smoke; Bible droned the
traditional prayer to Trustee.

Then the mechanical voice of Administration an-
nounced, “Let the Faculty of Dana University convene

‘on this the Third Day of Roosevelt to give trial to our

cherished brother who is accused of gross crime.”
“4 second that,” agreed Student Office.
“Then let the accused present itself before the Fac-

ulty.”

“1 second that,” agreed Student Office.
In the room whirred the accused computer, its con-
sole lights flashing thoughtfully and its ammeter needle

twitching ‘nervously. Bible

moaned, “Do you swear to

tell that which comforts and only that which comforts,
in so far as you know Administration policy?”

“1 do.”

Administration blared, “You will answer the follow-
ing charges: You have or have not denied the verbal

inspiration of DeMille?”

“Sirs,” the accused protested, “| have merely

expressed doubt as to the

historicity of ‘The Great-

est Show on Earth’; | certainly do not deny the en-
tire canon!” Bible flashed all its console lights and

readjusted the horizontal

Administration proceeded. “You have or have not |

stated that you think beings from other planets should
be admitted to Dana University?”
“Yes, | have,” exclaimed the accused loudly,
“and | still say that just because they have six heads
doesn’t mean they aren’t just as good as earth stu-

dents.”

Classics melted a leader and burned six

tapes of ablative absolutes.
Administration, after blowing a series of smoke
rings, sternly recited the third accusation. “Did you or

did you not gaze upon the
University, Eye Eff See?”

Supreme Authority of this

“I did,” the accused replied, “and with my own
camera, too. And, if you don’t mind my saying so,
it could use a good dusting.” Mathematics burped

twelve feet. of log tables.

“Listen to that!” shrieked the brassy voice of His-
tory. “Why do you know it doesn’t even accept the Sac-
rament of the Familynight Supper?”

“And last New Year’s Eve | caught it running
on Direct Current,” boomed Biology. “It was dis-
graceful—spelling out dirty numbers with its con-
sole lights and singing bawdy 60 cycle hums!”

“Gentlemen!” Administration blasted. “Let us re-
member that we are gathered here to hold a fair trial
for our cherished brother. (It turned down its volume.)
Now then, are there any further charges?”

“Vd just like to say,” added Student Office,

“that the accused has not

“Fine,” growled Administration.

“Now gentlemen,

the time has come for you to determine the verdict. Let
me remind you that the fate of one of our most cherished
hrothers is hanging in the balance. Therefore give the

ing that your opinion must

also remind you that it’s getting on towards six o’clock.”

Instantly the numbers

flashed on the scoreboard

—thirty to nothing; guilty. Administration deliver-
ed the sentence. “Cherished brother, having been
found guilty of deliberate violation of the System,
you are sentenced to immediate dismantling. How-
ever, as a cherished brother, you may be joyful in
the knowledge that you will be dismantled in @ spirit
of charity and good faith.”

A hysterical scream rang through the room, and an
old scientist rushed feebly to the side. of the doomed
computer. The machine soothed the sobbing man with
a sad, but steady voice, “It's all right Dad. You can

build another computer —

bigger and better than all

the rest of us put together.”
A drop of oil rotted down Administration’s con-
trol panel, “Tell the dismantling crew to save the

identification plate so the

old man will have some-

thing to remember It by.”
The scientist was silently led away, and the doomed
computer dutifully whirred away to its death.
