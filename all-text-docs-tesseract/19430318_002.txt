An Urgent Need....

Due to the exodus of students to the
armed serviees, The Davidsonian faces
the most critical period in its thirty years
of existanee, Difficulties have been
numerous throughout the year with a
smaller stati than usual. This has been
a natural consequence of the war condi-
tions. Men who will leave seheol soon
can not be expected to work with the
same interest as they would with the
usual opportunity tor advancement on
the stat. ut now the situation has+
reached the point where it is a ossibility
that The Davidsonian may become a war

~ Three of the four
managing editors are leaving in the ERC_
the first of .\pril. Tn spite of the pros-—
pect of their carly withdrawal from
school, these men are sticking to their
posts until that time with a spirit that
is admirable. But what, then? Many
have asked why the usual six managing
editors were not chosen this year. The
answer is simply that four was the sum
total of sophomores still working on the

“some bad tecling might have resulted.
Some students had unfortunately al-

Farewell ....

As the trickle of Davidson students
entering the armed services graws to a
steady tlow, we pause to pay tribute to
the many ealisted reservists who have
already gone and to those who leave us
soon. The poise and confidence of all
students during these trying months

nave been rauch praised already. We
add our voiee to the chorus. But it %

casy for us to speak casually of others
as they approach this important cross
roads of their Fives. It is not so easy

to face it ourselves. So we would par-
ticularly praise the spirit of these men
as they go into action.

Stories of the heroism and devotion
to duty of Davidson men are numerous.
We like to thik thvat some of this can
be attributed to the foundation they re-
ceived at Davidson. We know that the
men leaying here now acquit themselves
just as nobly, and we trust that they will

Mauze profoundly showed us in the serv=
ices last week.

We bid them Godspéed in their ight
jor the things we hold dear at D. C. and
look forward to the day when we shall
ioin them in the service.

Credits ....

The faculty has made a sound and
just pokey in their announcement of

iaithiG! freshmen continue to work_as__eedits to be given to underclassmen

hard as ever, but the number is too few.

We believe that there are enough men
in the student body who don’t want to
see The Davidsonian “fall through’
that would be willing to help regularly
with-the work. Members of the retiring
stafi have generously offered their con-
tinued service, and they have already
been called on with some hesitancy. We
hesitate to present this appeal here, but
these are the facts. Vi you have any
journalistic ability and would be willing
to help solve this problem by becoming a
regular member of the statf for the re-
mainder of the wear, pléase get in touch
with the editor right away.

Aiter four years of hard work and
