A New Homecoming
Can Revive Davidson Spirit

School spirit came alive last Sat-
urday. Maybe it had never been dead
for thirty years after all. Maybe the
enthusiasm of the football team
aroused the student body. Whatever
it was, it was great to be there in
Charlotte.

This is the year that we can have
a real homecoming. In the past, it
has been little more than a dance
weekend with a ball-game stuck in
for kicks. This year it-can be differ-
ent.

The IFC is interested. The DAVID-
SONIAN is interested. Many mem-
bers of the student body are inter-
ested. Hog and Bear and the rest of
the football team would be grateful.

What would a real homecoming
include? Where would it begin? Most.
of us have to get our ideas from
Chapel Hill or Durham, where our
sister schools have long laid stress
upon a good weekend stressing school
spirit both among the students and
among the alumni. It would have to
be something looked forward to ° ‘ith
eager anticipation. It would have to
be distinctively ours.

Let’s begin with what we have;
which isn’t’ much — to describe the
band and the cheerleaders brutally.
Both can be definitély improved. The,
cheerleaders in particular have the.
nucleus of an effective organization
which, given a few decent yells, could
do well.

The band could do better if it had
more morale and encouragement.
We can and should work to improve
what we have with us always. These
organizations have an obligation to do
their best which is akin to the respon-
sibility of the football team.

What do’ we need that is new? Fri-

day night is now the night of the
artist series. What more incongruous
introduction to a homecoming week-
end. Who yells at Vincent Price?

What we need, and need desper-*

ately, is to move the series back to
Thursday, if possible, and have a
genuine rally Fricay night on the
field. At the Wildcat rally, there
should be stunts from each fraternity
and contestants from each fraternity
for a homecoming queen. Then the
rally would conclude in a burst of
spirit which would put the weekend
into the proper perspective of spirit.

This would draw the alumni to the
campus orn seem to be almost
forgotten now, except for a dinner on
Saturday. They seem to be generally
excluded from the student activities.
All this is wrong.

Saturday morning is not just a
morning to sleep late. It should be
utilized. Perhaps we could start this
year by renewing the traditional Eu-
manean and Philanthropic debate se-
ries. Dressed in suitable ante-bellum
Southern regalia, and addressing each
other from the porches of their re-
spective houses, this would add a dis-
tinctive pageant to our celebration.

In the future, there should be a
committee to plan the homecoming
celebration a year in advance: to in-
vite dignitaries to share our spirit, to
plan publicity and allied means of
demonstrating to ourselves and to
others, that spirit at Davidson is a
real thing.

The football team started it all
with their enthusjasm. The student
body will have to respond and reci-
procate, or face the fact that it might
be true that we’re too cool to know
how to yell. Fight fiercely, Davidson!
Give ’em- hell, ’Cats.’ —R.EL.

New Horizons
For Fraternities

U. S. Senator Sam J. Ervin’s visit
to Patterson Fraternity Court this
week opens new horizons to the social
fraternities on campus.

Senator Ervin’s informal lecture
at the SAE house answers many ques-
tions that have been asked regarding
fraternities during the past two
weeks. His visit is an indication of
one way in which the social fraterni-
ties can benefit both. their members
and the entire student body.

Most of the really worthwhile
things that fraternities do at David-
son reach beyond the bounds of that
particular group. We brag loudest
about projects such as the Barium
Springs Christmas. Party, Greek Week
Activities, and fraternity - sponsored
Parents Days.

The possibilities that Senator
Ervin’s visit suggests are exciting.
Imagine the program of fraternity
sponsored visitors that could be de-
veloped under the coordination of the
Great Issues Committee and the In-
terfraternity Council. This program
could have a tremendous impact on
the intellectual environment of the
whole campus.

As a rule it has been left up to

he honorary fraternities and similar
\ Seannatons to bring outstanding

isitors to the campus. Last: year the
Great Issues Series was started, and
while it met with some success, it was
hurt by a lack of truly interested stu-
dents. Under social fraternity spon-
sorship such a lack of enthusiasm
would not exist; surely each fraterni-
ty member would strive to see that
his fraternity sponsored the most in-
teresting program of the series.

Such a program sponsored by the
social fraternities would probably be
unique on American campuses.

- The fraternity series need not

competé with the Great Issues Series
—it would be the nucleus of the Se-
ries. If properly developed the fra-
ternity visits will need more suitable
facilities such as the Union Ballroom.
The Great Issues Committee, with its
larger budget, could afford to have
one speaker of great national promi-
nence to highlight the year.

The prospect of such a series of
outstanding speakers, each having so-
cial fraternity support, to bring the
big issues to us is exciting.

It is our hope that this week’s
precedent develops into a tradition.
We recommend that the Great Issues
Committee and the IFC investigate
closely methods of supporting a-pro-
gram to keep Davidson informed by
first-hand information in a world that
demands awareness.

On Siates’ Rights

“The foes without are the Com-
munist nations striving to erase all
human dignity and freedom from the
earth’s surface. The foes within pose
a more serious threat to America than
the foes without. It is certainly easier
to devise a defense against external
foes.

“The foes within are those who
seek to destroy our “indestructible
States” by reducing the sovereignty
of the States to a maze of meaning-
less zeros on the Nation's map, and
concentrating all government powers
in the Federal Government.

“If they succeed in their objec-
tive, their success will sound the death
knell of liberty in America. This is
particularly true, because the States
are the only bulwark against the ev-
er pounding, encroaching surf which
threatens not only to submerge the
individual, but to destroy the only
existing society in . . . which per-
sonality and individuality can possi-
bly survive.”

SEEKS ACCEPTANCE

Meet Khrushchev
The Status Seeker

By PETER STERLING

es been delving into Mr.
Vance Packard’s incisive book, The Status Seekers.

On the international scale, much of what Mr. Pack-

ard says would serve to indicate why Mr. Khrushchev is
in the U. S.; Mr. Khrushchev is a status seeker.
JUNIOR EXEC

Simply being present in the U. S. raises Mr. K’s per-
sonal status and tends to place Russia on an equal foot-
ing with the U.S., at least in the eyes of much of the world.
The U.S. has arrived socially, so to spéak, therefore, ardu-
ous striving is not so necessary as for many of the ‘‘Junior
Executives” on the international scene.

“WE'LL BURY YOU”

Khrushchev’s stress upon the growth of Russian econ-
nomy, and the refusal to admit any failures, are char-
acteristic of one who attempts to gain social favor.

Equality in international trade is one of his objec-
tives. Repeatedly, he has stated that the U.S.S.R. is not

“looking for handouts” and

has not come “with hat in

hand". “The time is not far off when we will be .. . ahead
of you.” Does this sound like a man who is seeking emula-

tion?

One will notice that Mr. Khrushchev has refused to
comment about subjects such as Hungary or Tibet much
as a status-seeking person would refuse to discuss the

family’s “black sheep”.

He is a master at propaganda, but his goal is not
the American pecple, who he knows will not be dis-

‘suaded by anything he says, but the world population

from whom he is seeking acceptance for Soviet policies

present and future.

RESULTS
Mr. Packard affirms that one who is on the upward
march has little regard for those he has to trample up-
on to reach the top. Similarly, Mr. Khrushchev is using

the U.S. as a stepping stone

to world acceptance.

In such a situation, very few positive results will ac-
crue. from the Big Two Meetings simply because the Big
Two are not thinking about the same things; they cannot
be, since they are in different classes.

In The Aftermath

Of Rush Week:

K Look At Fraternity ‘Brotherhood’

By STU CHICHESTER

Now that the misty-eyed
soliloquies and super - firm
hand-clasps of Rush Week are
past, it is perhaps time to give
consideration to the real value
of fraternity life.

A fraternity generally pur-
ports to strive after Brother-
hood, its chief aim. During
Rush Week, men touchingly
confess to the rushee an in-
ability to describe this elusive
quality.

Perhaps this Brotherhood
is elusive because it so sel-
dom exists. This notion is
confirmed by the fact that
the most sought-after rushees
are those whosé sophistica-
tion is so great that they are
immune to the development
of the intense personal reta-
tionships which must exist in
a real brotherhood.

The practice of bidding on
appearances often leads to
tragedy. The freshman .who
talks small and dresses ivy
qualifies for a bid. He has
listened to speakers extol the
warm brotherhood within the
group. He pledges.

-He naturally seeks to find
the Brotherhood and is rebuff-
ed. His advances mark him as
one who is offensive and lacks
taste. Suddenly, in disillusion
ment, the pledge finds he does
not fit into a group which in
reality is cultivating polish and
not Brotherhood. ‘

Our criticism can only be
partially answered. The fra-
ternity obliges the individual
to broaden himself through
association with men whom,
if he were independent, he
would not have the desire or

* exist.

opportunity to know.

The fraternity man has both
an opportunity and an obliga-
tion to become acquainted with
varying types of people. If the
men within the fraternity are
indeed of varying types, and if
there are no cliques within the
group, this obligation may ac-
tually be carried out. Too oft-
en, however, the group becomes
homogeneous when it could be
broadened.

The fraternity is, by its na-
ture, a selective organization;
yet, the Christian is a broth-
er to alf men, hesitating to
judge anyone. The fraternal
organization, then, “not only
requires that the Christian
brother judge others on the
surely subjective, almost ir-
relevant, basis of social ac-
ceptability; but also, excludes
from the Constitutional
Brotherhood those whom the
Christian can best serve.

As an agent of mystic secret
symbolism expressed m  ab-
struse ritual, the fraternal or-
ganization has no reason to
Another _ organization
might provide a better boarding
house. If the fraternity at Da-
vidson is merely the expedient
group to sponsor off-campus
parties. then it should adver-
tise this foremost.

lf the fraternity does in-
deed offer an unique oppor-
tunity for brotherhood, per-
haps it is time to evaluate
and find that Brotherhood.

Did these boys pledge be-
cause they wanted to or because
everyone else did? And, even
more important, have they
been sold short?

BIGGER HOMECOMING?

MeKeithen Promises Big 1.F.C.
Year: Calls Rush Week Success

A bigger and better Home-
coming, new plans for Greek
Week 1960, more appearances
like that of the Kingston Trio
last. April, a re-examination of
Rush Week traditions and fra-
ternity ‘retreats—all these are
items on the Interfraternity
Council agenda for the year
1959-60.

In. an interview this week,
IFC president Ward McKeithen
presented plans for the aca-
demic year, after discussing his
reactions to the Rush Week
and fraternity pledging just
completed under the direction
of the council.

“Rush Week was a real suc-
cess,” MecKeithen said. “From
a standpoint of mechanics and.
freshman response it was .very
successful, and also from the-
angle of co-operation by rush
chairmen and fraternities with
the IFC.

“The two-day restriction on
dormitory rushing, IFC name
tags and a new method of mail-
ing return dates were all good
additions and greatly aided the
mechanical workings of Rush
Week, as did the new confir-
mation system introduced last
year.”

NO VIOLATIONS
McKeithen stated that there
have been no réported viola-

‘tions of IFC rushing regulations

or of any activity which might
be called “dirty rushing.” He
expressed satisfaction that
pledge classes seemed well-dis-
tributed among the various fra-
ternities.

Have you any suggestions for
changes in the rush program
for coming years? “Not spe-
cific ones, but Rush Week as
it now stands presents three

Y. M. 6. A. Will Present New

The YMCA cabinet initiates
this week a year’s program
which, it hopes, will provide
challenging participation for a
large number of the student
body. On the basis of this pro-
posed program and in order to
realize it Y workers are polling
student interests and seeking
student financial support dur-
ing the current two weeks.

The purpose behind the
plans of the cabinet includes at
least five aspects. There will
be opportunities both for deep-
ening and witnessing to Chris-
tian commitment and for re-

PFANUTS

lating the Christian faith to
life.

A third phase of purpose
will be the honoring and en-
couraging of the honest re-
ligious search, and e fourth
will be an effort to increase
the communication among
Christians and non - Chris
tians. Service to the neigh-
boring community will con-
stitute a fifth function of the
program.

One of the newest and most
interesting of proposed Y ac-
tivities is the fall Book-of-the-

problems to me. The first is
ene of time: is Rush Week too
early? Perhaps we can study
some system of deferred rush-
ing, although that seems now
to have a great many disadvant-
ages. Second, there is dorm
rushing; ‘it seems that there
should be some smoother way
of conducting this. Third, there
is a problem surrounding the
number of dates available.”

There has been talk recently
of a bigger and better Home-
coming for this year. What are
your comments about this?

“Well, the IFC will certain-
ly entertain any ideas along
these lines. A good band has
been secured, and the IFC plans
to emphasize the fraternity dis-
plays and give a trophy. We're
hoping for a bigger halftime
ceremony at the game — and
greater school spirit through
co-operation with the cheer-
leaders.

HOMECOMING QUEEN

“We're considering the pos-
sibility of having a Homecom-
ing Queen and maybe a pep
rally with fraternity stunts,
though this at present seems
unlikely because there is no
available time. The datice or-
chestra will play a free con-
cert after the game, and we're
hoping to have some activity in
Friday chapel.”

Has the IFC any plans for
future appearances such as that
of the Kingston Trio last April?

“Yes. I have been in cor-
respondence with agents in New
York concerning this. Nothing
definite has come up yet, but
we hope to have at least one
similar concert this fall.”

GREEK WEEK
What are your feelings about

. _ by Starling

Greek Week, 1960? What
chenges do you hope to see
made? .

“Il have high hopes for Greek
Week, and I think the students
are ready for Greek Week.
We're planning to promote a
big Greek Week with fraterni-
ty projects of a constructive
nature taking most of the
week’s time. We'll have a skit
night again this year, and we're
planning as last year’s IFC sug-
gested to give a Greek Week
trophy to the pledge class
judged most outstanding in.
spirit, skit performance, and so
forth.”

Has any progress been made
concerning the institution of
fraternity retreats?

“This must be done on the
individual fraternity level, of
course. The IFC will promote
tlie idea of fraternity retreats
and I’m hoping that we can get
the interest of the fraternities.
We wil! make booklets concern-
ing fraternity retreats available
to the fraternities, and Dave
Robinson can get a man from
the Y.M.C.A, who will help out
in getting the. thing across on
the campus. The IFC will act
as. an interest-generating body,
and work with the ‘Y’ in put-
ting it through.”

NEW OFFICER

MtKeithen announced that
Tom Ridenhour will serve as
treasurer of this year’s IFC;
Ridenhour was elected recent-

ly to replace Bu unter, who
left Davidson study in Wash-
ington this year.

The IFC president also stated
that the council will publish a
full financial report after each
dance weekend of the 1959-'60
school year.

And Varied Program

for the coming year. United Na-
tions speakers, seminars, and
mock sessions, work with
World University Service, and
the publicizing of opportunities
for summer service will con-
stitute some of the featured
activities of the area of world
relatedness.

The voluntary chapel pro-
gram, initiated during the
last winter, began fast Mon-
day; the student-led services
will be held each Monday
and Wednesday in Lingle
Chape!. Another new con-

cern in the area of worship
will be Easter and Holy

Week services.

Deputations work tentatively
will involve a ministry at Bari-
um Springs and in a local pri-
son, in addition to its more tra-
ditional activities. In the area
of community service the cabi-
het anticipates an expansion of
its function to include weekend
work camps and srooperation
with some Charlotte service or-
ganizations.

Most of these projects are
new; they are the result of
the thought and discussion of
those who were elected and
sppointed to work with the
Y last spring.

The cabinet has continued -
and will continue the great ma-

jority of already established Y
functions, such as the Hand-
book and the Gift Fund.

On the basis of this program,
the YMCA Cabinet is seeking

! both student participation and

financial support.
