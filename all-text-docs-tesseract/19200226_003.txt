“Y” HEARS FINE.
ADDRESS BY DR. RAYNAL

Speaker Shows Glory of Scriptural
Kingdom Depends on Mind,
Not Matter.

Sunday evening Dr. E. C. Raynal
addressed the “Y” on the Glory of
the Spiritual Kingdom as shown
through the minds that God has
given to men. His text presented
jthe glory of the Lord in the New
Jerusalem: “Speak to this youtg
man... for 1, saith the Lord, will be
the glory in the midst of her.”

The unselfish mind was presented
as the genius of all ages inventing
and creating the wonders that have
made all peoples blessed. America
has failed to realize this essential
fact in that she has bent her su-
preme endeavor to the prodttction of
a great business and cnormous
She has
gone farther in this extreme than
Germany ever has in the develop-
ment of her extreme militarism.
America holds her position today in-
stead of that of darkest Africa not
because of superior resources but
because of superior mentality.

America today has a greater op-
portunity than any other country.
Will she still fail to realize the true
value of the man! Christ was valued
iat 30 pieces of silver and yet the
world today is Christian instead of
Greek or Roman because Christ and
His disciples made use of “the glory
of the Lord in the midst,” of the
power of that given to man instead
of blind learning and force as did
Greece and Rome.

STUDENTS ARE URGED
TO PAY “Y” ASSESSMENT

A renewed effort has been made
iv the past few weeks to collect the
remainder of the students’ three dol-
lar Y. M.C. A. fees. Often it is difi-
cult to find a man in his room or still
oftener he has not the money, and it
is impossible to strike him at the
right time. For this reason there is
‘at present owing to the Y. M. C. A.
more than $300 from the student
subscriptions.

More money this year has been
‘contributed by outside friends of the
college than by the students. Dr.
Arbuckle, Professor Reed and Mr.
Jackson have raised on the outside
almost a thousand dollars for the
-support of the Y. It is necessary
|that the balance from the students
be paid at once if the movies are to
continue and the secretary’s salary
be promptly paid. It is not fair to
ithe others for part of the men to pay
and the rest avoid the issue. FEspe-
cially is it hard to see personally the
‘men who room in town and if those
who have not yet paid will do so
without canvassing it will be greatly
appreciated by those in charge. The
men to pay are Schenck, Sullivan,
Boulware, Chalmers and Askew.
| Make your check payable to the Y.
M. C. A.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND
BIBLE CLASSES

| ‘Fhe Mission Sunday Schools and
the various Bible classes began
again last Sunday, since the “flu”
has been so kind in leaving the cam-
pus, and every one should be ready
now to make the religious work
count during the next three months.
, The attendance was good in many of
the classes but there is plenty of
room for improvement.

Those who have been going out to
the different schools every Sunday
have done their work well and
should be commended for it. But
why cannot other fellows help them
‘out by going too. It is not only
necessary for enough to teach the
‘classes to go but those who have
‘gone a few times know how the peo-
ple out there like for a crowd from
Davidson to be present.

of the staff of the Reading Hospital,
Reading, Pa.

Of our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced
$308,000 in forty-five days. During the same period twenty-eight Train-
ing School men produced $2,694,000, an average of $92,000 per man.
When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
