Wildcats split in

soccer games last week

By PERRY MATHEWES

The Davidson soccer team
split their two games this week to
bring. their record to 5-12-1.
Saturday, in a rainy game, they
fell 6-1 to UNCC, then won at The
Citadel 3-2 Wednesday night.

In the UNCC game, the two
teams played fairly evenly but
UNCC made their shots count,
scoring three goals on four shots
in the first half. Davidson, how-
ever, missed many of their oppor-
tunities.

Davidson’s goal came in the
first half. A long pass from senior
forward Brian Shockley found
junior midfielder Chip Wittmann
who tipped the ball over to junior,
forward Craig Mattison. Matti-
son’s volley then found the’ pee .
of the net.

The team was hurt by the ve
sence of.junior sweeper Michael
Spear. Spear has been a steady
player for several years and the
team does not have a backup

Field hockey has high hopes for next season

By EDWIN PAGE

The Davidson women’s field
hockey team concluded their sea-
son last weekend at the Deep
South Tournament at Catawba
College. Although the team was
winless for the weekend, there
were some fine performances in-
dividually and as a team.

Davidson was unfortunately
seeded last among the college
teams which meant a tough early

schedule in the tournament. On-

Friday, the.Cats started off with
the number two seed among the

sweeper. With Spear out due to an
injury, freshman Rob Vest was
moved back, but his inexperience
at that position showed.

The Citadel game went much
better for the Wildcats. Just four
minutes into the game, Shockley
headed the ball in for a goal to give
Davidson the lead. Mattison was
credited with the assist.

After the quick goal, how-
ever, the team lost some of thier
intensity and allowed The Citadel
to equalize. The sige ida score
was I-].

The Cats came out in the sec-
ond half with a much different at-
titude. Playing with more inten-
sity, they dominated the rest of the

~game: Senior fullback Steve Stith

made a long cross that beat the de-

«fense to find freshman forward
- Jim Walker, who scored with his

left foot.

Spear scored Davidson’s last
goal on a penalty kick when
sophomore forward Mike Fried-
lander was tripped in the penalty

college teams, Pfeiffer. The Cats
played well but fell short in a I -0
loss.

In the next game, later that af-
ternoon,
Point. They played well but
fatigue set in quickly. Sophomore
Suzanne Mauze and senior cap-
tain Heather McKee helped the
Cats’ cause with goals, but it was
not enough as Davidson fell 3-2.

On Saturday, the team faced a
fine Carolina Club team, and| re-
sponded to the challenge with
their strongest game of the
weekend. Unfortunately, they
could not score and Carolina es-
caped with a 1-0 victory on the

Davidson faced” High

box with four minutes left in the
game.

Davidson again eased up and
allowed: The Citadel to narrow the
margin a minute later on a defen-
Sive error.

Coach Charlie Slagle was
pleased with the win. Davidson
clinched third place in the South-
ern Conference with a 3-2 record.

“Motivation is tough since we
didn’t reach our goals of the sea-
_son, to win the conference and to
break .500,” Slagle said.

Davidson will host Richmond
_tomorrow at 2 p.m. then Akron,
“the number six team in the nation,
Sunday at | p.m.

“Richmond is a pretty team to
watch, they one touch the ball a
lot, but they have had trouble
scoring this year. Hopefully we’ ll
give them a good game,” Slagle
said.

Akron will be much tougher,
but an enjoyable team to see. This
will be Davidson’s last game of
the season.

strength of a second half goal.
Sunday, Davidson lost to the
Durham club team by a 4-0 tally.

On the individual level, sev-
eral Davidson players were
selected to one of the Deep South
all-star teams. Senior Heather
McKee missed Big South | for the
first time in her career, but was
selected to the Big South 2 team.
Junior Mandy Barrett, Mauze and
freshman Marta Bukowski were
all first time selections to the Big
South 3 team. These teams will
practice this weekend in prepara-
tion for the Southeast tournament
at the University of Richmond
starting Nov. 15.

Sophomore Mike Friedlander vies for the header .

The team finished the regular
season with a 1-2-1 record. The
loss of McKee, Davidson's
strongest player for each of the
last four years, along with goalie
Nana Lay and ‘midfielder Polly
Northen will leave some big gaps
to be filled next season, but over-
all, the team is very young.

In assessing the ‘season,
Bukowski said, “We had a new
coach and lots of inexperience.
We really came together at the end
which is good motivation for next
year.”

Freshman Christi Sloane said,
“We seemed to get better and bet-
ter, we did everything but score. It

was hard for the seniors, but we’re
all very positive about next year.”

McKee, the team’s leading
scorer on the season, agreed. “‘I
felt we improved a lot over the
season. We became more of a
team and people's individual
skills improved as well.”

Despite vast gains in the areas
of experience and skills the team
will miss McKee’s steady play of
the last four seasons. Possibly the.
best field hockey player in the his-
tory of Davidson,’ McKee has re-
ceived All-Deep South honors in
each of her four years. Even more

‘impressive was her selection to

the Olympic trials in the spring of
1984.

By EDWIN PAGE

The men’s and women’s cross
country teams became the first of
Davdison’s teams to end_ their
Southern Conference association
when they ran in the SC cham-
pionships for the final time Satur-
day. The men ran to a seventh
place finish and the women placed
fifth in a field of seven teams.

Senior Greg Foreman led the
men’s team’ with a fine time of,

erry ge we,

for the season by 26 seconds. The
time-was the best for any David-
son runner this season.

He was followed by junior
Chris Fisher. Freshman Jay
Clugston ran his best time as a
Wildcat to place third. Senior
Emil Cekada and sophomore Bill
Hartman rounded out the scoring.

The men placed in front of
Western Carolina and The Citadel
in the standings. The défeat of The
Citadel marked an improvement

over, last “Season, when the team,

beat only Western in an eighth
place showing.

For the women, the Southern

Conference was unquestionably
their best race of the season. Five

of the seven women running for.

Davidson posted their best times

led the Cats with a time of 20:28,
topping her previous best effort by
1:06. Classmate Morrow Reeves

Kemerait en route to the fifth spot
on the team. Freshman Missy

Willis came in fourth for the.

Furman. The defeat of Furman
was especially gratifying since the
Paladins had beaten Davidson ear-
lier in the season.

Coach Gary, Andrew said of

the race, “I-was. thrilled. with-the-

way the girls ran. It was by far
their best effort of the season.”
“Looking back to where we
‘starteg, I feel very positive about
the season so far. We’ve progres-
sed a lot. Everything has gone re-

‘ally well,” Andrew said.

Both teams have a week off in
preparation for the NCAA Region
III meet at Furman on Nov. ‘15.
The race will. give the Cats a
chance to run against some of the .
best teams in the country, and -
should provide a good conclusion
