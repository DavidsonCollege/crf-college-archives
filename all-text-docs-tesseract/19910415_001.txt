Patterson Court Council Suggests
More Changes in Alcohol Policy

By Jared Baxter

During the Spring semester the
Patterson Court Council has been
revising its Alcohol Policcy.
Because of the recent concenrns
of underage drinking and alcohol
abuse, the P.C.C. has furthered its
efforts to better control these prob-
lems.

Changes that were made last
semester included a campus-wide
talk by Will Keim, party monitors,
police officers present at parties
sponsored by 3 houses or more,
and the mosteffective action, stop-
ping weekday parties at‘l1:00 am,
and weekend parties at 2:00 am.

by theP.C.C. for the Eating Houses
and Fraternities include: educat-
ing their members about the alco-
hol policy twice a year instead of
once a year, containers no larger
than 16 oz. allowed on Patterson
Court (previously 22 0z.), one party
monitor from each House sponsor-
ing the party on duty at all times,
police officers hired for any party
sponsored by two or more Houses
(previously 3), and finally, “no
table or similar object will be per-
mitted at the entrance or exit of the
designated drinking area.”

The first change is to make
sure the new people joining the
Houses in the Spring are better

educated about the Patterson Court
Alcohol Policy. In the past the
Alcohol Policy has been ina book-
let the Freshmen receive before
coming down to the Court. Usu-
ally this was skipped over and not
read. This way, afterthe Freshmen
join a House they will be better
educated about the policies.

The 16 oz. change is being
made because 22 oz. sounds like a
large amount, and16 oz. cups are
the convention on the Court any-
way. (All of these changes were
made after consulting the law firm
of the Trustees of Davidson Col-
lege. Harrison Marshall ’79, a
lawyer in the firm, was the liason
and proved to be a very helpful
resource. It was Marshall’s con-
cern that 22 oz. sounded like a
gross amount.)

The two-party-monitors re-
quirement was made to help insure
safety at parties. A problem expe-

rienced.in the past was that. of.a

monitor having to leave the party
because someone was hurtand then
having no monitor on duty. This
way there will always be at least
one back-up monitor, and for larger
parties (with 3 or more Houses)
there will be a better monitor-to-
partier ratio. Additionally, in-
creased House Monitors would
reduce the number of people driv-
ing while under the influence of
alcohol.

Police officers will be: hired
for any party sponsored by two or
more Houses because they have
proved very effective at parties
sponsored by three ormore Houses.
The parties are calmer, fights are
less frequent and the party atmos-
phere is generally safer.

The final change is probably
the most important as far as culpa-
bility on the part of the Houses and
College is concerned. Harrison
Marshall explained to the P.C.C.

"Take Back

the Night"

Raises Awareness

By Rob Kelley

Although the crowd that gath-
ered on the Chambers steps last
Monday didn’t look that large,
when rain forced the event up into
the 900 room, the chairs filled
quickly and a thick ring of people
were left standing behind them.

Co-sponsored by the Commit-
tee for Women’s Issues and the
Rape Awareness Committee, the
first Annual “Take Back the Night”
started off Davidson’s Solidarity
Week, and organizers expect it to
become a yearly event.

Freshman Heather Flint, one
of four speakers, described her
story. While visiting Princeton
University as a prospective, Flint
sampled the fraternity row and after
being slipped a loaded mixed drink,
she began to feel dizzy and de-
cided to leave. She was accompa-
nied by another prospective she
did not know but who went to a

high school near hers. Stopping -

off in another fraternity house to
use the bathroom, Flint fell asleep
in the lounge. Upon waking up an
unknown time later, “I was pressed
up beneath the sink, and my head
was knocking against the pipes.
My lower body was ‘still numb
from the alcohol, so I just had to
watch him [the prospective] rape
me.”

Lastly, sophomore Adriana
‘Tavernise and her graduated
brother Peter talked about how their
lives had been affected by Adri-
ana’s double experiences of being
sexually assaulted at age four and
raped at age sixteen.

“I started wearing very loose-
fitting clothing,” Adriana said. “I
felt like I had RAPE written all
over me. I blamed myself. ‘What
was itabout me thatattracted these
people?’”

Peter, upon finding outsaid, “I
