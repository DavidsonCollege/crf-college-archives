Emory For Win

The Wildcat swim team
travels to Williamsburg this
afternoon to battle confer-
ence power William and
Mary.

The swimmers will all
have to turn in outstanding
times to stay in the pool
against the highly favored
Indians.

As usual, the big men for
Davidson are expected to
be Jim Newton and. Mac
Davis in the sprints

These two offer the best
chances of victory, and team

“We don’t ever swim well
against VMI," stated swim

coach Tom Stevens. ‘Every
time we go down there and
our boys see that place, all
they can think about is get
ting back home.

In this way, Coach Stevens
voiced his disappointment
with the times turned in, by
the team. VMI dominated
the entire meet, as the Wild-
-cats ‘were held to only fwo
victories.

Mac Davis picked up the
lone individual victory, in
the 50 yard freestyle, then
teamed with Winn, Stott
and Newton for the other
winning performance, the
400 freestyle relay.

The only other bright spot
for the Cats was Hunter

“But recruiting is like

ANSWER
MAN

BOB STONE

Once life insurance is purchased, are physi-
cal exams needed for additional polices?

Yes, in most cases. However, Northwestern
Mutual's “Additional Purchase Benefit” (APB)
enables policyowners at six separate times
in their lives to acquire additional insurance
without a physical examination.

If you are a young man, I’m sure you'll find APB

of particular interest.

I'd like to point out that the six regular purchase
dates are at ages 25, 28, 31, 34, 37; and 40.

There’s more to the story. For 90 days following
marriage or the birth of a child, you may. anticipate
the next regular purchase date and obtain addition-
al insurance immediately without taking a physical
examination. During these 90 days the insurance
under, this priviledge is automatically in effect.

For complete details on APB, as well\as other
NML advantages, call or write me. I will be glad
to help you with your life insurance planning.
