“y” CABINET SRENDS GOOD
TIME NEAR MOUNT MOURNE
Availing themselves of the very first

of the spring weather, the Y. M. C. A.

cabinet took to the woods last Sunday

for a last informal outing together be-
fore the installation of a new set of of-
ficers next month. The party left the

Hill just after dinner Saturday and es-

tablished themselves at the home of Mr.

and Mrs. R. L. Morrison, near Mount

Mourne. They returned that night long

enough to see the basketball game, and

spent the remainder of the evening and
all of Sunday in the delightful atmos-
phere of the Morrison home.

Sunday morning was consumed by a
detailed discussion, led by various mem-
bers, of the needs and ayants that the
Y. M. C. A. is expected to meet. After
a recess in which the party strolled about
in small groups, and a magnificent chick-
en dinner, the discussion was resumed
in the afternoon by discussing the
things that the ideal Y. M. C. A. ought
to be. The cabinet finally decided that
the most urgent need was for the recon-
secration of every officer to his tasks,
and it was with this thought uppermost
in every mind that, the discussion broke
up, and the party began its trip home.

Too great praise cannot be given Mrs.
Morrison for her charming hospitality
and for her thoughtfulness in providing
everything that could possibly have been
asked for the comfort of the party. The
trip could not possibly have been the
great success that it was, apart from her
aid.

Saturday afternoon was largely de-
voted ‘to a riotous game of indoor base-
ball, with sad effects on a large corn-
field just behind the diamond. John
Railey and McDowell Richards deserve
special mention for their splendid effi-
ciency.in retrieving flies. which. journey-

The whole party tramped in Saturday
night to see the game. The return trip

OGDEN AND GAMBLE SPEAK
TEN TIMES‘IN GASTONIA

Last Sunday and Monday Ogden and
Gamble visited Gastonia as a deputation
from the Ministerial Band. On Sunday
they spoke at the West Avenue and the
First Presbyterian Churches and on
Monday they spoke at the ptblic schools.
The Sunday services were given to chal-
lenges for decision for full-time Chris-
tian service and the talks at the schools
were given to challenges to make one’s
life useful to the person just at hand and
to as many people in the world as pos-
sible, and to this end it was urged that
as many years in school as possible be
Striven for and that the students prac-
tice loyalty, honesty, and unselfishness
in their school life.

With two church services, two talks
at Sunday School, three talks to the
young people of the churches, and three
talks at the public schools, these men
had a busy and happy trip, and report a

mound,

splendid reception by the Gastonia
people.

On March 8 the Y. M. C. A. is going
to start a “Life Work Campaign” to last
through 12, Dr. John M, Vander Meulen,
president of Louisville Theological Semi-
nary, will conduct these meetings.

This is a thing which will interest ev-
ery man on the hill,
the Y. M. C. A. wants every man to be
thinking earnestly about his life work.
Dr. Vander Meulen will speak five times
and will hold half-hour interviews with
all who desire to talk with him about
their life work.

In these five days

These meetings will be a combined
evangelistic and life work campaign.
The evangelistic meetings are usually

held in the fall, but as none were held
last fall, that part is combined with the
Life Work Campaign. :

This campaign was conducted last
spring by Dr. Taliafero Thompson, as
any upper-classman will remember, and
