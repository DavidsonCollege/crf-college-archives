THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17 ,1992

D. A. Thompson: Modest Stillness and Humility
Davidson College: Woodberry Forest's Graduate Division?

Apologies abound to those
from the north who may not be
familiar with the institution men-
tioned in the headline. I could
have justas easily chosen Phillips-
Exeter, Andover, Nobles, or Mil-
ton Academy, as I’m not going to
poke fun at the candy-ass prep
schools of this Grand Old South;
but at those members of our own
community who would run this
college like one. (Although itmight
be fun to discuss these bastions of
the banal where boys are shuffled
off to become men by snapping
towels at younger butts after Dad’s
ditched the marriage for a leggy
stewardess and Mom’s taken up
with a bottle of Dewar’s and that
dark young genius behind the lat-
est exhibition at the Community
Arts Center.)

Anyway, there is in our midst
a not so merry band of pranksters
who think they have the authority
to hand down mandates regarding
specific aspects of studentlife. For
those of you who don’t know al-

ready, the faculty recently passeda
resolution which would fiddle
around with the daily schedule a
bit. None of the class time changes
are particularly important, but
dangling like chum at the end of
this petty fiat is a statement defin-
ing certain “quiet hours” within
the dormitories. The faculty pass-
ing edicts about quiet hours, you
ask? Where, you might be won-
dering, would they get the author-
ity to do such a thing? That’s the
funny part, them’s just up and took
it.
I love the story behind this
one: a few faculty members, Heil,
Barber, etalia told the Educational
Policy Committee that several
students (whata wonderfully weak
and noncommittal phrase, “‘sev-
eral students”) were unable to
complete their assignments on time
because their halls were just too
darn noisy to get any work done.
Ha! Where the hell were these
guys when I was a freshman?

Beyond Birkenstock:

"It's a Surreal Thanksgiving, Charlie Brown"

Hey, guess what!

What?

Hey, its Valentine’s weekend,
and we’ re too busy toactually write
a brand new column tocapture this
week’s cultural zeitgeist. Fortu-
nately, we have aRESERVE. This
literary gem was written to com-
memorate the upcoming thanks-
giving, now long past. Thanks to
our now dearly departed copy edi-
tor, you were UNFAIRLY DE-
NIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SEE IT. Now, thanks to our new,
benevolent editor, this IMPOR-
TANT WORK isavailable for your
consumption. Be assured, how-
ever, that next week we will be
back toreveal conclusive evidence
that GOVERNOR BILL CLIN-
TON has a small wissenschaft.
You’ ll want to stay tuned.

By the way, in an effort to
make Thanksgiving more inclu-
sive, we’ ve given it kind of a Jew-
ish slant. C-ya.

The Birks

Shalom Thanksgiving, Birkba-
bies! It’s that time again. . . yes,
the point in the linear space/time
contineum (for, as you recall, fa-
ther Einstein precludes non-linear
space/time) when reds are tree and
we slit our creative veins open for
your holiday entertainment. Some
other words we might use: ...
fecund, trite, or any of the 200,000
or so words in the American lan-
guage (we don’t speak no Anglish,
round thase paarts, paardner).that
have absolutely nothing to do with
whatever thought we might have
been about toconvey, which by the
way, we have unfortunately for-
gotten, as this sentence stretches
interminably onward. What was
it, again Jean-Jacque? (we’re chan-
neling with Rousseau this week--
an enlightened kind of guy) When
the butterball moon reaches its
cranberry perihelion . . . knives
_ will glint, birds will run, Tums

dissolve in a sea of acrimony...
Red Rum, Red Rum. . . whoa,
maybe the spirits are a little rest-
less this evening. .. you would be
too if you had to spend eternity

runs with Michael

else’s administrative turf, perhaps,
but I wish I’d known about their
gullibility back then. I’m getting
all weepy as I imagine the never
found amusement of snowing these
guys with tales of late papers and
dates with Jackie O. “Actually sir,
the lovely first lady was particu-
larly depressed about her former
brother in law’s penchant for
drowning his dates, and kept suck-
ing back Schlitz until dawn,” I’d
say. They might even buy Genny
Flowers’ story.

Somehow these folks man-
aged to peddle this nonsense to the
whole faculty who, after much
debate, mounted their trusty steed,
patted Sancho on the head, and
charged full tilt at that cacopho-
nous windmill. Actually, the Quix-
otic metaphor won’t quite do it:

Donny Q was just deluded, and

while those who voted for the quiet
hours proposition have certainly
demonstrated that they shouldn’t
handle sharp things or drive, to tell
the Director of Residence Life that

poetry. Granted, our allusions are
more obvious than a post-cubbist
revival, but neither do we harbor
any illusions about our reader’s
command of the classics, or their
own bladder control, for that mat-

he’s not doing his job properly is
flatly insulting. We already havea
system for keeping the peace in the
dorms which works just fine.

Davidson prides itself on main-
taining a communal atmosphere.
When it comes to dorm life, that
means the students living on each
hall decide for themselves which
hours of the evening will be re-
garded quiet. When there is too
much noise, a student is free to ask
the offending parties to please put
a sock in it. Most problems are
cleared up just like that. If the
rambunctious transgressors of the
quiet hours pact continue in their
too auditory revels, the R. A. steps
in. On the rare occasion that the R.
A.’s request goes unheeded, the
problem is turned over to the Resi-
dence Life Office.

The system is simple, unfet-
tered by too many written rules,
and effective. Most importantly, it
is managed impressively by Rich-
ard Terry. Even though Belk still
smells funny, dorm life is for the

sentence, ‘n stuff? And speaking
of Adam and Eve, is the legacy of
that “original sin” thing a horrible
curse on Adam so thathe is forever
after automatically required to
reach for the check at dinner in

order to demonstrate

world is unbelievably humorless
and you’re surprised Charlie

bership in HairClub for Men.
Family Circus is funnier. And who
wants authority figures saying stuff

Which brings us to the point of all
this pretentious dribble: there isn’t

should have read, “Did Adam and

cted as a phallic representation of
male dominance] tempt them to
eat pheasant instead? These are
the kind of things that you too can
think about when you learn to re-
lease that cloying deathgrip on
reality. Think of the
bumperstickers: You’ll take my

most part pretty pleasant. The
faculty’s interference in matters of
residential administration is not
needed or, quite frankly, wanted.
In the end, of course, their new
injunction will be ignored. The
students know what works for them
when it comes to hall dynamics,
and faculty decrees to the contrary
will do nothing to change the
nightly routine.

. Finally, do the teachers who
sponsored this little legislative ditty
also propose to enforce it? Will we
see junior faculty members patrol-
ling the halls in the wee hours of
each morning to make sure the
new rule is in effect? Of course
not. The faculty’s proposition is,
in closing, merely rude hot air: it
stems from incredibly silly and
probably fictitious student com-
plaints, it snubs the work of the
R.L.O, and it is impossible to im-
plement effectively. The faculty
has wasted their time dreamily
combatting pseudo-crises in the
dorms.

always turns on during the one
good scene in /t’s A Wonderful
Life, where finally George decides
his life is worth living after all, and
the damn knife makes a whining
noise not unlike certain Democratic
hopefuls, and you can’t hear so
you turn it up; but someone yells
from the kitchen, “why don’t.you
turn off the TV and come in here,
we’re almost ready to eat,” but it

carry the freshly carved turkey (it
takes about 45 minutes because
Granpa Joe probably shouldn’t be
handling cutlery in his state, but
you should see him try and drive
home) to the table, and then some
generic aunt asks you how school
is, SO you Open your mouth to
answer, but Granma Rhoda picks
that paticular moment to ask what
kind of meat you want, as if it
really mattered inthe grand scheme
of things whether you eat another
living creature’s leg, or just nibble
on its breast, but you’re not even
sure you want to tell your relatives
that you’ve been vegetarian for
three months ‘cause youknow what
kind of crap you’d get about that,
plus you’re not even sure you can
morally justify this staged glut-
tony as an act of “thanksgiving,”
nor are you even convinced that
the concept of God is a relevant
one, or that the holiday itself,
handed down from your Puritan
ancestors, is politically correct,
‘cause, hey, we sure did screw the
Indians, didn’t we, I mean, your
house is probably built on some
vanished tribe’s sacred burial
grounds, and that’s just as much
genocide as anything Hitler ever
cooked up, isn’ tit, butyou’re kinda
shallow, so none of these thoughts
