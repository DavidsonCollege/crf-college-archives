Four Candidates Interviewed |
For Watson Foundation Funds | -, "|

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

Daniel L. Arnaud, director of
the Watson Foundation, was at
Davidson this week to interview
four Davidson seniors who are
candidates for the $6000
fellowships which the _ foun-
dation awards.

‘*We will award 70 fellowships
this year from a field of 140 can-
didates. We don't have any
quota system, though. so it is
possible for all the candidates
from a given school to win,” Ar-
naud explained.

The fellowships are for a year
of travel and independent
study, custom-fitted for each
winner. Ordinarily, the award
is not intended to be used as
tuition for a year of study in a
foreign university, so the
projects can be as_ un-
conventional and independent
as individual needs dictate.

‘George Draughon, one of
last year’s recipients, is
travelling in Europe currently,
studying mime and visual
theatre. I heard recently that he

naud said.

“Another successful project
was undertaken by a girl who
looked at different aspects of
prejudice in Northern Ireland
and in South Africa.” he said.

Arnaud estimated that 30 per-
cent of the fellowships are
awarded to women candidates.
and he said that minority
awards are earned by about 20
percent of the applicants.

“Davidson has fared quite
well in this program since its in-
ception in 1969, with 10 seniors
receiving the fellowships. This
is above average in all re-
spects.”’ Arnaud stated.

“The very fact of having been
nominated is something of
merit. What is involved is not so
much winners and losers, but a
matter of degree,’ said Ar-
naud.

At the conclusion of the year
of travel, a report on the project
is submitted to the Watson
Foundation. “This is not. in-

she added

Kemp did go on to say that
she was very sympathetic to the
problems that the science
departments might have if
experimentation was
interrupted by the split in the
winter term.

Carroll indicated that
problems would be more likely
in the biology laboratories than
in the chemistry ones. ‘‘As far
as the chemistry courses I teach
are concerned, there would be
no problem.” he said. “I can't
think of any chemistry courses
where the labs would be
disrupted.

Overall I think this calendar
has a lot of advantages over the
tirst one.” Carroll said.

David C. Grant, professor of
biwlogy. disagreed. “If we must
have a split winter term, this is

a good calendar. but | loathe the
split. A split no matter where it
comes hurts somebody. It hurts
the scheduling of reviews and
may force protessors to change
the sequence of material."

Grant is particularly
concerned about biological
experiments dealing with living
systems. “There can be no 10
week experiments during the
split winter term. The split
limits the flexibility.

“The calendar meets almost
all of the conveniences of the
students.’ Grant said. “I hope
that it is not so convenient that
we forget about the academic
cost.”

Davidson as being in the

worth it, however.’ White com-

When asked if additional

said that he couldn't see David-

near future.

Edmunds White stated that
“the cost of Davidson next year
will be an important factor for
people who are considering ap-
plying here.”

He said, “Private colleges in

not, in terms of admissions of
students. in as strong a position
as they were five or eight years
ago.”

He pointed to the overall cost
