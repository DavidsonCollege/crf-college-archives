Last Sunday, in what we consider
one of the best sermons of the whole
school year, Dr. Moffet clearly and
forcefully pointed out the great neg-
lect on the part of many to sympa-
thize with, and do their part in help-
ing, one of the avowedly greatest
forces in the world for the impartial

- and loving spread of peace and good-
will, and the all-important message of
God, of which these other accomplish- |
ments are the fruit. That Cause
Foreign Missions.

Let us divide all Christians into two
groups: (1) those who actually enter
into Christian service as their life
work, and (2) those who, entering into
other lines of work, continue to prac-
tice Christian principles, and are ever
loyal to Christianity in so far as to
help with their money to carry the
work forward. Then under each of
these two heads comes the question of
whether it shall be primarily for the
work in the United States, or in some
foreign country where in many cases
there are overwhelming numbers .who
have never heard: one word of the
“God of Abraham, and Isaac,
Jacob.” In the country’s great three-
fold weakness in morality, society, and
finance, we are not surprised to find
that both of these divisions and sub-
divisions of Christian activity are be-
ing neglected to an alarming degree.
But the cause of Foreign Missions has
suffered most severely of all.

and

An open heart to a great cause like
this, comparable to real character, is
not inherited. It cannot be perpetu-
ated in indifferent people. The herit-
age of Davidson has ever pointed her
students loyalty worthwhile
causes, but indifference has taken its
toll here as everywhere. What shall
be our response?

At this time special attention is be-
ing directed to the great cause of Mis-
sions in far-away lands. So far it seems
that as fast as richer opportunities for
doing good are pointed out, they are
met with greater and greater indiffer-
ence. But things are undoubtedly com-
ing to a change. The attempts of busi-
ness leaders to cure this old world’s
troubles ended in sickening failure,
when the brains and billions of Rocke-
feller, motivated as everyone knows
they were, left things worse off than
before, and gave thousands of already
indifferent people a tiny straw to clutch

of God except when we are desperately in
