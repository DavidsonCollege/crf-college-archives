S. Korean Student
Likes Campus Life

By MIKE MYERS

(This is the first of two
articles dealing with exchange -
student James Hyun. In this
first article Mike Myers has
written a biographical sketch
of the South Korean. Next
week he will give us an in-
sight into the Korean mind
and way of life—Ed. note.)

If you would stop for a moment
and think back to where you were
prior to June 25, 1950, it might
be interesting to compare our drab
existence with that of James Hyun.

I was safely at home, just
through with my frosh year at
co'lege. My biggest problem was
getting to the beach before T missed
too much fun.

James, who is two years my
senior, was in his second year at
medical school in the Orient’s most
beautiful city, Seoul. And his prob.
lems, too, were trivial.

1 got to the beach. But on the
26th James’ world changed. Before
that night was over his hometown
changed hands and he himself was
awaken by his father so he could
hide in a nearby tree and escape
the North Koreans who were re-
cruiting boys, giving them a .rifle

dead or mixsing. Proportionally
that would be 500 of our student
body.

James served in the South Ko.
rean navy during this period and
his family evacuated on foot to
the port city of Pusan. In normal

Chartes Williams was elected

was crammed with 1,500,000 peo-
ple.

Now his family has returned to
this looted home and are living un-

lines to shoot their own people.

James Hyun is another of Da-
vidson’s special students, this one a
full-fledged doctor. The surprising-
ly tall. South -Korean is quietly
absorbing the American way of life
and liking every minute of it.

He has put in more TV hours
than most fraternities. He eats ice
cream by the quart. He
more girls than is healthy. (One.
a Bryn Mawr student, sent him an
expensive stethoscope for Thanks-
giving.)

But don’t think he’s not taking
college seriously. His broher-in-
law in Richmond arranged through
Dr. Cunningham for James to come
here on scholarship.

He arrived in October a month
late for the opening of college,
and Dr. Spencer advised him to
wait around until the second semes-
ter, But James gave it a try, made
good on his Eglislh, Genetics and
Histology, so is now an enrolled
student.

From here he plans to intern for
4 or 5 years, then return home
and work as a U.N. doctor.

On the morning of the North
Korean attack mentioned earlier,
the town of Seoul was caught off
guard. Some had forseen the possi-
bility but for days the government
radio had blared “Seoul is’ safe.”

The last of the four times Seoul
changed hands it was little more
than level land, Of the 160 students
in James’ medical class 100 were

The point of difficulty, she said,
is to translate the knowledge now
available on sex and marriage into
workable wisdom.

Dividing love into the three
Greek categories of the word—
eros, sensual love; philos, com-
panionship; and agapos, disin-
terested love—she concluded that
all three are necessary for a vital
and happy marriage. :

Dr. and Mrs. Nash are making
an around-the-world-tour begin-

March. On it, he will lecture on
“Christianity and Higher Educa-
tion, and she on marriage counsel-

They will spend six months in
India and from there they will
tour the South and North Atlantic
countries.

Mrs. Nash is the author of the
book “With This Ring.” “Associa-

those memories get the best of
us. The human memory is a
treacherous thing and will in-
evitably retain only the best
impressions of said females For
one reason or another the love-
ly things are always able to
write the most convincing let-
ters, letters which seem cer-
tain authentications of our
mental images.

One of two situations often then
occurs. The warmth of the sum-
mer fades into winter's cold and
we make that weekend trip to
see her.

Somehow it just isn’t the
same girl with no bathing suit.
The alternative is that stripped
of her colorful winter garb and
false fronts and eased into ag
swim suit, again it isn’t the
same.

In the best Davidson tradition
of gentlemanliness we are at least
polite to the babe much to her
amazement because of the previous
postal passion. It is a long drag
back to school.

Experience, however, seems to
be the worst of instructors and
the hopeful campus heart is soon
again laboring under an illusion of
“The perfect girl, I mean a real
queen”

team as they were easy 38 to 23
victors over the Phi Gams. The
winners exhibited an excellent de.
fense that held Larry Champion,
the Phi Gams’ top scorer, to six
points.

Very little can be said about the
relative merit of the various teams
until the rest of the fraternities
see action, but it looks as if a close
race is in the cards this year.

Spivak got his first big engage-

He was so successful that. the
Casino, traditionally a summer
spot, broke a precedent by keeping
the doors open for the winter
season to accommodate Spivak’s
drawing power.

Spivak came to the Cafe Rouge
of the Hotel Statler shortly there-
after, and broke Glenn Miller's and
Jinsmy Dorsey's records.

Davidson College, for it is he who
gave fine music for the Midwinters

The gift fund this year was
in the form of a rehabilitation
program for Korean amputee
civilians. Sponsored by the
Board of World Missions of
the Presbyterian Church, U.S.,
and by Church World Serv-

money to be used in securing
artificial limbs and in vocation-
ally rehabilitating Korean
civilians.

A great deal of statistical work
remains to be done. The statistics
of the drive, when completed, wil!
show the total, amount per class,
amount per capita, the percentage
of students participating, and the
percéntage in each class. These
figures will be given to the Da.
