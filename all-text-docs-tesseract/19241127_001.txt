Bishop Rondthaler of
Salem College Makes
Scholarly Address

Intellectual Responsibility is Theme.
of Revered Moravian Minister

URGES STUDENTS TO ACT

Introduced by Dr. Lingle As a
Leader in Educational and
Social Matters |

The Intellectual Responsibility of College
Men was the interesting and inspiring sub- |
ject used by Bishop Rondthaler, of Win-|
ston-Salem, speaking before a large audience
of college students and townspeople in. the |
Y. M. C. A. Vesper services Sunday even: |
ing. Dr. Rondthaler is the father of Presi-|
dent Rondthaler, of Salem College, who
spoke at Davidson two years ago. In intro-
ducing the speaker of the evening, Dr. Lingle
paid a tribute to father and son as being
without equals as father and son in the work
of educational and religious leadership in
the state.

“It is the young man’s business to think.
Why then can I not think as I please?” was
the question asked in the introductory re-
marks,

The speaker answered this question by
stating that God reckons with us on the
vigor and tenor of our thoughts, whether
are right wrong. The instance
was cited of the experience through which
Germany and the world passed because of
student thought in Germany. Bismarck
used student enthusiasm aroused by student
thought to start the Prussian militaristic
idea, which led to the Prussian-Austrian
War, to the war with France, and ultimately
to the World War.

“What the student is thinking today, the
world will think 10 years from now, so
strong is the influence of student thought on
the world!”

The idea was stressed that men must think
these days on the great subjects of mind and
soul. Is there really any mind or any soul?

or

the speaker, “If pushed to its ultimate conse-
quences would deprive us of God,
Bible, of our moral destiny,” was spoken of
as one which for a while gained great con-
trol, but which is now losing ground.

Reporters Take in New
Men; Capacity Reached

Eleven faithful Workers on Paper
Are Included in the Club Mem-
bership

Saturday morning saw the campus invaded
by the Legion of Paper Hats. Freshmen
gaped and the old men knew eleven men had
been furnishing readable material for The
Davidsonian (occasionally) and that the
Reporters’ Club in issuing the eleven paper
hats had donned the wearers with no small
honor.

At 10 o'clock Saturday night the testing
time came and the 11 initiates came through
successfully and were duly installed as mem-
bers of the Reporters’ Club.

L. L. Deck, and C. L. Bragaw.

Immediately following the impressive ini-
tiation, a most elaborate feed was enjoyed by
all and mostly by the new comers. To con-
clude the program that evening, the reporters
were favored by short, snappy and instruc-
tive talks by Allen Hurd, Chalmers, Mcl!-
waine and Fred Smith, -

The public initiation was concluded Tues-
day night just before the Converse Glee Club
rendered its attractive program, The’ pubtié
initiation was up to par in the shining line
in the form of Fatty Laws in a barrel with
his cohorts appropriately and foolishly cos-
tumed. Individual shines were outstanding.

STUDENTS TAKE PART

Musical Numbers and One-Act Play
Make up the Concert’s Program

The Glee Club of the Greensboro College
for Women entertained approximately 300
people in Shegeer Hall last Thursday night,
and from the expressions of most of the at-
tendants the performance was well received
and enjoyed. The entertainment consisted
of choruses, solos and other musical num-
bers, interspersed with a reading and one-
act play, which added materially to the ef-
fect of the performance.

The costumes the girls were
and becoming. The appearance of the girls
in their lovely ‘dresses aided the general ac-
ceptance of the performance as a good one.
This is one of the most important factors in
girls’ glee clubs and good taste had been ex-
ercised in the selections of the costumes.

The program opened with the entire per-
sonnel in three choruses. At the beginning
of the performance the girls seemed to lack
any animation in their choruses, but toward
the last they became vivacious and put a lit-
tle more life into their singing.

in order that no publication of the student

Following a successful season of football
in which they had not lost a single game, the
Freshman eleven went down to the Sandlap-

administered drubbing by the powerful

defenders came back in the second halt, how-

Whether the Freshmen were afraid of the
Furman the first half, whether the
Davidson boys were a little off color by their
early Greenville, whether the
drive of the Furman team was too great for
the Wildkittens cannot be determined, It is
known, that the latter put up a
great fight in the last half and in the clos-
