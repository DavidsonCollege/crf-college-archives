Another sport is in its final vain
spurt. Basketball has come into its
own in the south this year. It still

doesn't attract the crowds that fol-
low the games in the mid-west, but

a big forward step has been taken.

Originated as a game for old men,
the hardwood game has developed
into a fast, hard sport. Skill, speed,
stamina, experience — it takes all
these.to be a polished basketball
player.-

The modern game calls for per-
fect conditioning. Blocks, © fast
break offenses and the like call for
tremendous physical abilities. Bruis-
es play their part. Signals and
plays must be learned.

Coin Flip

A flip of a coin was resorted to in
order to decide whether Maryland
or Davidson would get the eighth
place in the conference basketball
tournament. Some of the boys
must have been living right
for Lady Luck deserted to the camp
of the Old Liners and we lost our
chance at the-tournament.

not

It was unfortunate that the class
of the loop was so concentrated in
North Carolina this year. North
Carolina, State, and Wake Forest
were all among the four seeded
teams; the only outsider being the
leader, Washington & Lee.

Led by Capt. Bill Quick and
“Harpo” Peabody, the Cats really
opened up when they whipped Car-
olina, and they closed with a well-
earned win over the Erskine Seced-
ers. Up from the frosh ranks, Mf, 1D),
Hicks and Ned Iverson showed they
could hold their own in the fastest
of company. John Armstrong cap-
ped his career by consistently
steady performances. Bill Kiese-
wetter, Bill Hancock, Johnny Tice,
Lawrence Reid, Bill Boyd, Ken
Knorr, Wade Barrow and Dan Iv-
erson all covered themselves
glory in the time each played.

with

Prep Tourney

We are getting our taste of tour-
nament basketball here now (Mon-
day). Those Cadets from Oak Ridge
seem to be the class of the tour-
ney with a smooth passing attack.
Led by Charlie Sims, those Ridgers
did everything with that basketball
but make it talk.

Those Abbey boys also play a
fast, Accurate: game, and at this
time I feel safe in predicting that
these boys will play the Ridgers in
the finals, but Jim McCachren’s
boys seem to pack too much~scor-
ing punch. There were originally
more teams entered but snow kept
all but six in the mountains.

These junior college and prep
events do a lot of good. The ath-
letes are given a first hand oppor-
tunity to see a college which they
might attend. Then again, just th
occasion of the tournament calls for
a spot to hold the event, and a good
will seems to pay its dividends in
the end.

George Matthis has been careful-
ly nursing his knee, injured on the
gridiron this year. He enly hoped
to escape injury to his knee during
spring practice. Alderman McLean,
wishing to help George get his wish
offered to rub his rabbit’s foot on
the treasured joint. This done, off
to the wars went Sir George. But,
alas, Alderman is in the dog-house
now — George can hardly move
about on his knee now.

Those Phi Gams are really out
for that interfraternity sports cup.
So far, they’ve won tag football,
volley-ball, and . basketball _ titles,
It’s not over yet, but it looks sorta
close,

The golf course is getting more
and more popular. Like some of
the smaller, stricter colleges, and
prep schools (for example, Rich-
mond U., Woodberry Forest, and
McCallie). wouldn’t it be nicer and
a lot less expensive to have the boys
playing golf and tennis on Sunday?
Of course, this is not during church
hours, This isn’t radical, and it
would produce a healthier, more
constructive Sunday. Don’t you

think so? ~

King made the longest runs of the

Six Entries Battle For Junior
Championship

With two colleges advancing into
the semi-finals round through byes,
the first round of the North Caro-
lina junior college basketball tour-
hament opened at Davidson Col-
ege Monday, March 1 with top
seeded Oak Ridge playing Boiling
Springs. The two colleges receiv-
ing byes were Lees-McRae and
Wingate.
Six teams entered the tournament
this year. They were Oak Ridge,
soiling Springs, Wingate, Belmont
Abbey, Presbyterian and Lees-Mc-
Rae. Oak Ridge in the upper
bracket and Belmont Abbey in the
lower flight were the two seeded
teams.

had to play the
semi-finals, while Wingate met
Oak Ridge, conqueror of Boiling
Springs.
Oak Ridge Seeded

The Oak Ridge team was seeded
one of its season record
which showed fifteen victories out
of twenty games played. Tyson,
lanky center, and Sims, long shoot-
ing guard, are the main threats of
the cadet team during this season.
The second seeded team, Belmont
Abbey, was built around John
“Monk” Meyer and “Butch” Had-
acek, forward and guard, respec-
tively.

CAPTAIN QUICK IS STAR

Four Seniors Play Well In
Last Game of Career

Closing their season in a blaze
of glory, the Wildcat basketeers
swept to an easy 45-31 victory over
the Erskine Seceders here in Alum-
ni Gymnasium Saturday night.

Coach Laird started the game
with his usual first-string €6mbina-
tion of Peabody, Iverson, Hicks,
Armstrong and Quick. The Cats
jumped off to a good lead and held
it during the entire first half, leav-
ing the floor on the long end of an
18-14 score. Erskine tied the count
at 28-all midway of the second half,
but then Davidson pulled away and
was never headed.

Quick Stars

Captain Bill Quick ended his ca-
reer in grand style, shooting 14
points for individual high scoring
honors. He was followed closely by
his buddy and running mate, Mau-
tice Peabody, also a senior, with 11.
Bill Hancock turned in one of his
best games of the season, and John
Armstrong played in his usual
steady, dependable style. By virtue
of this victory the Lairdmen
rounded out their season with 13
wins against 10 losses, a marked
improvement, over last year’s rec-
ord. With the exception of Quick,
Peabody, Armstrong and Hancock

Southern Conference
Tournament

Eight crack Southern Conference

basketball quints will take to the
hardwood Thursday inaugurating
the 16th annual tournament in Me-
morial Auditorium at Raleigh.
* The committee in charge of se-
lecting the teams to compete was
faced with the problem of decid-
ing the eighth place team since
Davidson and Maryland were tied
for the position, A coin was tossed
and Maryland landed a berth by vir-
tue of this heads or tails method.
It is too bad that duplicate awards
do not go to tying contestants in
this loop.

Washington & Lee, number one
seeded, encounters the University
of South Carolina in the opening en-
gagement Thursday afternoon at 3
o'clock. The two teams have not
met previously this season and
therefore a hot contest should be on
the make. Other seeded teams are:
the University of North Carolina
White Phantoms, second; the Wake
Forest Deacons, third; and North
Carolina State Red Terrors, fourth.

The Red Terrors will open the
first night’s fireworks against the
Maryland Terps followed by what
should be one of the hardest fought
games of the meet which takes
place between the N. C, White
Phantoms and Duke Blue Devils.
This is the first time the two have
a first round tilt and al-
though Carolina has taken Duke
twice the Devils would like nothing
better than to eliminate their old
rivals from further competition.

Wake Forest and University of
Richmond Spiders face each other
for the first time with the winner
going on to meet the victor of the
Duke-Carolina battle. The Deacs
are looked on as the dark horse of
the tourney and they may prove
disastrous before it’s all over. It
is hard to get a line on the Spiders
from their schedule of tournament
opposition previously met this sea-
son.

The tournament closes one of the
most successful seasons in confer-
ence ball. Semi-finals Friday night
will start at 8 o’clock and the fi-
nal comes off at 8:30 Saturday
night. Officials are quite satisfied
with the outlay especially all first
round pairings and the stage is set
for the best this part of the coun-
try has to offer in the way of bas-
ketball.

At a meeting of the freshman bas-

and Benny Harrison were elected
honorary co-captains for the 1937
season Whih has just closed.

The Wildkittens played a short,
hard schedule this season with no
breathers and all but two of their
games being against the strong
freshman teams of Southern Con-
ference members. North Carolina,
Wake Forest, and N. C._State’s

the Wildkittens and Duke’s Blue

GAMMON HIGH SCORER

Carolina’s Ace Trackman
Scores Ten Points

Scoring in all ten events, the Uni-
versity of North Carolina's track
men breezed to victory in the eighth
annual indoor track meet at ‘Chapel
Hill, Saturday.

Led by speedy Graham Gammon,
individual high scorer with 10
points, the Heels garnered 45 1-2
points, while Duke, defending
champs, were getting 30. Davidson
sent thirteen men to the meet, but
failed to place, although several
rendered very good accounts of
themselves. The Wildcats came
nearest to scoring in the two mile.
Boo Walker was running easily in
third place with sixteen of the eigh-
teen laps behind him, when Lump-
kin, in first place “lapped” him.
The signal was flashed to Lumpkin
that he had only one lap to go.

‘Walker made the very natural mis-

take of thinking that the signal was
meant for himself and _ sprinted
around only to find when he left
the track that he was disqualified
for having run only seventeen laps.

Bill Black, only frosh entry from
Davidson, tied for fourth place
with a jump of 5 ft. 6 in. The win-
ner jumped 5 ft. 8 in. Monroe Wick-
er won his trial in the high hur-
dles and finished fifth in the finals.
Walt Dickson qualified for the 60-
yard dash, but lost out in the semi-
finals, Other Davidson men who
went to the meet were Wade Bar-
Bill Hickman, Frank Harri-
son, Mokie Faison, Dave Wood-
ward, Bill Telford, Frank Brown,
Bruce Parcell and Dave Warden.

A crowd that overflowed the Tin
Can, Carolina’s big indoor sports
arena, saw seven records fall in the
finals of four divisions, conference,
non-conference, freshman and
scholastic. Billy Hopkins of Vir-
ginia and Bill Lumpkin of Rich-
mond, especially thrilled the crowd
with record breaking times on the
60-yard dash and two mile run re-
spectively.
