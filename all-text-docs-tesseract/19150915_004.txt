The DAVIDSONIAN. September 15, 1915

FRESH-SOPH GAME.

The annual Fresh-Soph. base ball
game was played on the Sprunt Athletic
Field Monday morning, September 6.
The Sophs won in a very slow game by
the scure of 6 to 2. In the first frame it
looked pretty dark for the Sophs when
after a series of hits, the Fresh put two
runs across the plate. This good fuck,
however, did not last very long. When
the Sophs saw that the Fresh really meant
business, they tightened up, and the
Freshmen ‘were unable to put another
run across. The Sophs began to warm
up in the second inning and proceeded to
rap on Currie during the remainder of
the game. for seven hits. The Fresh
scored only three hits, two of which
came in the first inning.

The Fresh played very good ball for
men who were new to each other, hav-
ing never practiced together before the
game, The line-up was as follows:

Fresh. Sophs.
Dean, Harwood, 3b Woods, ss
Ferris, c Black, 3b
McAskill, If Pharr, 2b

NEW MEMBER OF FACULTY
TAKES UP DUTIES

Prof. W. W. Woods, who is the
latest addition to the Davidson faculty,
comes to us highly recommended by the
authorities at the University of Virginia,
where he took his Bachelor's and Civil
Engineering degrees. While there he
was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa
honorary fraternity and one of the lead-
ers of his class.

For the last three years he has been in
active engineering work with the Du-
Pont Powder Company, but gave up his
position with them to take up. special
work at the University of Virginia dur-
ing the past summer, preparatory to his
coming to Davidson. As a member of
the Davidson ‘faculty he will teach
Mathematics, Geology and Astronomy.
The people of Davidson welcome Pro-
fessor Woods to his new position, and
he enters upon his duties with the best
wishes of the entire student body.

MATRICULATION FIGURES.

Up to date the register shows that 342 | -

students have matriculated. It it practi-
cally certain that the number will reach
350 within the next few days. The
student body is composed of men gather-
ed from all over the South, representing
ten states and three foreign countries.
It is a significant fact that Davidson has
more students from other states than
any college in North Carolina. South
Carolina furnishes 62, Georgia 27, Vir-
ginia 15, Mississippi 13, Alabama 1, Ar-
kansas 7, Tennessee 13, Texas 3, and
North Carolina 185.

Of these 57 have chosen the ministry
as a profession, 57 medicine, 24 law, 7
teaching, § agriculture, 25 some form of
scientific work, and 22 business.

All things point to one of the most
successful and satisfactory terms in Dav-
idson’s history.
