Physical Education

Program Successful

AN ANALYSIS
By TODD EADES
Staff Writer

The new physical education
program. after being in effect
for one term, is working rather
well. Problems were to be ex-
pected with an innovative pro-
gram but they are being dealt
with. Overall. the program has
been favorably received.

The most favorable compon-
ent of the program is its flex-
ibility. Students hgve two op-
uions to fulfill their physica) ed-
requirements. One is
tO pass a profiency test in a
sport. the other is to attend
classes in that sport with credit
being given even if proficiency

The Many Faces Of Crime

A REVIEW
By FRANK SOOS

Nyahh! says Eleck the Milk-
man from across the room with
a puss that looks like it just
got busted up by the boys in
the back room. Eleck, better
known as Alexander Evans, is
in Stowe Galleries this month
along with fifteen or so of his
hooligan friends. The show is
famous criminals brought to
you by Ted Potter of Winston-
Salem, director of the Gallery
vf Contemporary Art.

These criminal faces, each
replete with a nifty wanted
poster that brings to light the
heinous deeds of a nasty life.
look like they could well have
walked straight out of the pages
of a Dickens novel. They're
mean men — from the days
when it was something to be a
hood. No draft dodgers, dope
sellers here. only clean living
sneak thieves. pickpockets and
the lot. Don’t go away get.

Ted Potter is an
many

artist of
faces (this weel’s bad
pun). His work ranges from
strictly standard oil painting
and drawing to a collage like
echnique in what are probably
the best works of the show. A
sketch comes to life through
the use of cut-out-paste-ons and
bright colors that set off the
sneer-face criminals. Sometime.
portions of the face are cover-
ed by a cut-out counter part.

The effect is both grotesque

is not attained. providing the

student does not over cut. the

class.

The worst problem was a mis
understanding over attendance
rules) of | physical education
classes caused by inadequate
communication of the program
to the students. Many students
believed that attendance — of
classes which they had regis
tered for was not compulsory.
Attendance is compulsory, with
the college 25'* cut rule in ef-
fect, if credit for that sport is
expected from that class and
not the proficiency test option.

The new program allows stu-—

dents to spend less time in the
gyvm if they have the necessary
skills in a sport, instead of be
ing required to spend time in
class merely to receive credit.
But the student with little ath-
letic ability or inclination still
must attend classes or acquire
the skills on his own.

The Physical Education de-
partment stresses the student's
acquisition of skills in a sport
more than simple physical ac
tivity, and the new program
supports this idea.

But there are drawbacks to
the new system, due mostly to
its newness. Registration was
and still is disorganized and
communication between © stu
dents and the gym is poor.

The proficiency tests have
some problems also, such as
finding a coach to administer
the test. Students have been lax
in showing up to take the test

and ironic. Henry Cline will
draw you into his corner of the
room with his bloody red eye.
He'll leave you puzzled at the
spontaneous power in the pic-
words that are coming out of
his mouth in a steady, sneaky
stream.

Sometimes Potter’s work can
be weak. A couple of the things
don't jump off the wall at you,
but if you will look closely you
can see great bits in all of the
works. He handles his mediums
very facilely: particularly note-
worthy are his varied effects on
canvas.

after signing up, too. Some of
the tests are too difficult, and
ome are too easy, but this js
being worked on.

The new program has been
well received by most coaches,
who have fewer students, and
by the students who have avoid-
cd twenty hour-long classes by
passing a test.

Freshmen have accepted the
program and most of them are
making progress towards the
physical education requirement.
The idea of not having to spend
unnecessary time in the gym
is well liked.

Sophomores are having more
trouble, mostly because they
feel they can put off the re-
quirements until later. But there
are several seniors who have
not. completed their  require-
nents, and it seems that they
might not be graduated  be-
cause of it.

Physical education still has
its problems like all the other
departments, but the new pro-
gram definitely is, as Athletic
Director Tom Scott said. ‘‘a
great improvement” over the
old system.

Often his work is careless but
this carelessness can lead to a
spontaneous power in the pic-
ture. His smudged sketches do
all they can to suggest a sooty
character. I don't know if it
works as well for poor mats
and stickers on the glass.

For further insight into those
jJaundice-eyed rats of the good
old days, come by the galleries
on the sixth (not the eighth as
formerly advertised) of Decem-
ber to hear Potter himself ex-
plain his work. The show will
be up until December 16 for
more leisurely looking.
