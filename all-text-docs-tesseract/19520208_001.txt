Two One-Acts
Are Scheduled
By Alpha Psi

The Iota Kappa Cast of Alpha
Psi Omega, national honorary
dramatic fraternity, announced this
week that it would present two one
act plays in arena staging in the
Dome Room Theatre of Chambers
Building at 8:15 p.m., on February
21, 22, and 23.

The plays to be presented are
How He Lied to Her Husband by
George Bernard Shaw, and Bound
East for Cardiff by Eugene O'Neill.
The cast for the Shaw. play ‘in-
cludes Vance Mizelle as the Poet;
Mrs. Alan Gripe as the Wife; and
Tad Currie as the Husband.

The cast of the O'Neill play
is headed by Tink Taylor ‘as
Yank; Dick Perkins as Dris-
coll; Ted Daniel as Davis;
Howard Proctor as Cocky; Mac
Doubles as Scotty; Vance Mi-
zelie as Olson, and Tad Currie
as the Captain. Professor R. W.
Tyson will direct both plays.
The production crews are headed

by F. G. Currie as technical di.
rector; Jack Pietenpol, Charles
Burnett, Guin Griffin on lights;
Mac Williamson on sound; Bill
Crymes on make-up, and Courtney
Hill on costumes,

The method of staging the
productions marks the first
time an arena production has
been given in this area. As the
audience is seated completely
around the acting area, thus the
name arena, they feel as if they
are a part of the play and ac-
cording to Professor Tyson the
result is an adventure and a
thrill seldom experienced by the
average theatre-goer.

The admission charge is 25 cents
and since the seating capacity of
the theatre is limited all seats are
reserved. Tickets may be secured
either from Tad Currie in 112 East
or from Prof. Tyson in 142 Cham.

lobby of Chambers after chapel be-
ginning on Monday, February 18.

Dating In Sweden
Is Lots Simpler

By INGMAN LINDMARKER
After the somewhat disastrous story in this paper by Mr.

Meyers about

man, and I made to venerable Salem College, I have
conclusion is that it might be wise to eliminate the ter-

ing. My

rible misconception of the dating system in Sweden

I wilt give M. and some others
an idea of how to behave when
dating a girl in my home country.

No Blind Dates

Let us say that you are a foreign

student at a Swedish college for
. boys. You would have to get used

to our unfriendliness (we don’t

speak to evéryone on the campus,

ete.) and forget about blind dates.
ein my country we call that “cow
ttyade” and it is used only among
ihe Laps in the extreme north.
/ Of course your first thought

would be to get hold of a tent, but
* forget about that. It is only in Hol-

land that the girls’ colleges look
- like a camping convention every
weekend.

Get a Bike, Ike

You get to know the young ladies
at informal dances to which you
need riot bring your own date.
‘When you have found a so-called
queen, you need not even worry
about getting a car, because only
snow shoveliers and sociallists have
their own cars. All the rest have
bicycles or toboggans

In the summertime you take your
girl riding on your bike and on
your tobaggan in the winter. It is
all very charming and the girls
often judge their date after how fast
he can cycle or down how steep

hills he dares to go with his tob-
baggan.

I know that at least in the
South you very likely give the
girl an inferiority complex unless
you tell her that you love her pas-
sionately on the first date. Don’t
ever tell.a Swedish girl that. She
will be scared to death or just
laugh at you and leave you.

No. 11 Is the One

For the fisst..ceg,, times you had
better just take her for rides and
talk about Communism and T. S.
Eliot. On your eleventh date you
had better act.

If you would ask a girl to go
to a football game with you, she
would think that either you were
insané or pulling her leg. Don’t
try to compliment her on her hair
or dress, for she knows that she
and all other Swedish girls are
pretty. Don’t try to assure her she
is the most wonderful girl you have
ever seen, she will appreciate it
more if you ask her to drop dead.

It’s Cheaper There

After the first date it is custom.
ary to let the girl pay her own
way. If you don’t let her, she will
take it as a personal insult.

Don't brag about your being an

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1952

Dean Brown Explains:

Type Error Adds
Day To Holidays

One more holiday is added to Spring holidays, it has been
revealed by Dean C. K. Brown who pointed out a typographical
error in the current catalogue. The present schedule lists holi-
days as March 21-25 and it should read 21-26.

Dean Brown said that there is
absolutely no possibility of length-
ening the spring vacation, either
now or in the future, unless the
amount of the extension be added
to the end of the school year or
subtracted from the examination
period. The association to which
Davidson belongs demands a mini-
mum of fifteen weeks of class days,
excluding the exam period.

“It is impossible to lengthen
the school year,” he said, “as
such would interfere with the
summer sessions, As it is now,
Davidson has a longer exami-
nation period than the great ma.
jority of institutions, having ten
days where most have seven.
“This is of decided advantage to

the students, as it gives them more
time for review before exams and
affords many students an oppor-
tunity for a short vacation in the
midst of this tiring perios.”

While it is possible that at some
time the faculty may decide to
lengthen the spring vacation at the
expense of the exam’ period, Dean
Brown said that it is most likely
that’ the extension would be one of
not more than one or two days, as
a longer interruption in the school
program is undesirable.

Notice

Stuart Plummer has an-
nounced that the next issue of
the devotional booklet, “Faith
On Campus,” will come out
Wednesday, February 13. It will
be printed along the same plan
used for the last issue, but will
this time contain devotionals
for the two-month period Feb-
ruary and March, rather than
for a one-month period.

Pledge Projects
Open Greek Week

Abbreviated to three days for its shakedown cruise, Greek
Week will be officially launched as a program of the Inter-
fraternity Council on the Davidson campus Monday afternoon.

Originally scheduled for four days
of activity, the initial operation of
Greek Week was trimmed to three
days by the IFC for two reasons,
president Dick Stockton explained.
Many fraternities have initiations
planned Thursday night, along with
their formal banquets and individual
ritual in connection with the initia-
tion. Secondly, the IFC felt that a
small program, done well, would
get Greek Week off to a much bet-
ter start than failure of an attempted
large scale program.

Cooperative Project

“The fraternities are interested,
and rightly so, in preserving their
individuality,” Stockton said. “Our
program is one entirely of volun-
tary cooperation, for the stimulation
of closer feelings between the fra-
ternities, and to develop our frater-
nity system along constructive
lines.

“We don’t want to monopolize
the fraternities’ time during the
important period of member instal-
lation. As they grow to know and
understand the. Greek Week pro-
gram, they will lengthen it them-
selves, if they want, by voluntary
cooperative action through the
IFC.”

In Business Area

This year’s schedule begins Mon-
day afternoon at 1:30 with the
pledges of the fraternities assem-

bling for a sanitation work proj-
ect, They will move in, back of the
business district, cleaning up trash
and clearing away high grass and
weeds which stand as fire hazards
and nests for rats. Upon comple-
tion of this task they will move
to Erwin Lodge, working toward
the campus in the construction of a
path to connect the two, Pete Kalo-
gridis, president of Beta Theta Pi,
will be in charge of the work
projects,

Monday mght there will be an
exchange supper, with pledge
classes splitting and visiting among
the various fraternity boarding
houses.

Variety Show

Tuesday night a variety show,
under the direction of SAE presi-

ident Alex Goley, will be presented

in Chambers Auditorium. Each
pledge class will be given five min-
utes for its contribution to the
show. Judges will be Dr. C, J. Piet-
enpol, Professor James S. Purcell,
Jr., and D, Grier Martin.

Wednesday night there will be
another exchange supper and a
6:30 meeting of fraternity officers
to discuss mutual problems.

Stockton said that every frater-
nity has expressed full support of
the first program. .

Pygmalion’ Is) YMCA’‘s To Meet
ULFS Opener|Here In March

The Y cabinet has formulated tentative plans for a Study
Conference on YMCA activities and the Student Christian Asso-
ciation, to be held at Davidson, president Allan Strand said today.

In New Series

The United Literary Film
Society has announced four out-
standing foreign and American
films for its 1952 Spring series,

The films are all significant from
the point of view of their subject,
acting, and cinematic techniques
and represent some of the best
works that have been done in the
medium of art films.

The purpose of the U.L.FS.
has been to provide relief from
the constant avalanche of bril-
liantined cuties, emirking heroes
and tedious commercial formu.
‘las emanating from Hollywood.

Season tickets are $1.00 and may
be purchased from Jack Hunter or
Stuart Shippey.

The following are the films on the
program:

FEBRUARY 29 — PYGMA.-
LION—This play by: George Ber-
nard Shaw is superbly acted by
Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller.
The movie is the product of an un-
usually brilliant combination of
talents with the screen’ play by
Shaw himself, music by Arthur
Honegger, and production by Ga-
briel Pascal.

MARCH 7—THE MIKADO—
This delightful operetta by Gilbert
and Sullivan is performed by Ken-
ny Baker, John Barclay and the
world.famed D'’Oyly Carte Com-
pany. The film is in technicolor and
staging, acting and music all meas-
ure up to the D’Oyly Carte’s finest
tradition.

MARCH 28 — GRAND ILLU-
SION—This is the story of a Ger-
man prison camp and features the
acting of one of the best-known
actor-directors in Europe and
America: Eric von Stroheim. The
director is Jean Renoir
River” and “Tower Depths”). The
film was acclaimed by the National
Board of Review as “One of the
greatest films in any language.”

APRIL 11—FAME IS THE
SPUR—This little-known British
film was produced by the studio
that turned out “Hamlet” and
“Henry V.’ The fiim presents a

‘| panorama of political England from

the Jabor unrest of the 1870's to
Ramsay MacDonald’s first national
government.

Michael Redgrave’s superior act-
ing and the film's intelligent hand-
ling of British history drew the fol-
lowing comment from Archer Wins-
sten of the New York Post: “Any-
one who believes that films can be
art, serious art, and that art can
also teach and tell and show, in the
highest sense, must see this film.”

The purpose of this conference
is to. determine what the Y as a
national organization is doing in the
varied fields of Christianity, and
to evaluate its program with an
eye to improvement. .

Representatives from 17 colleges,
both women and men, will attend
the forum, and a series of discus-
sions will constitute the program.

Some Open Meetings

As yet there is no definite sched-
ule of events, but some of the
meetings will be open to the stu-
dent body, which is cordially in-
vited to attend, and all the worship
services are open to the boys and
faculty,

Boyd Is Main Speaker

The main speaker at this confer-
ence will be Dr. Robert Boyd, pas-
tor of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian
Church in Charlotte. Acting as re-
source leader and observer will be
Rev. Edward Driscoll, secretary of
the Southern Area Student: Coun-
cil of the YMCA, with offices in
Atlanta.

An interesting note in connection
with Rev. Driscoll is that while
attending the University of Florida,
he was a member of the church
where Dr, Cunningham was. pastor.
He is a graduate of Union Semi-
nary in New York, and visited the
campus in October. The Y hopes
to benefit by ‘his assistance in the
discussions, and looks forward to
his help in directing the conference
along the proper lines,

Constitution
Comes In For

Investigation

By JIM MOORE

A general revision of Davidson's
electoral system, key-noted by Lee
Harter’s motion for revision of two
points under Article IX of the Con.
stitution, was the main thought ex-
pressed in the first “town meeting”
of the student body this morning.

After pointing out some of
the inadequacies of the present
electoral set-up, Harter went on
to show that the means for bet-
ter student-faculty relationships
existed but were not being em-
ployed. He said that the Stu.
dent-Faculty Committee which
is provided for in the Con.
stitution was not now in ex-
istence.

Harter then made a motion for
the formation of a committee to re-
vise the Constitution to meet its
present needs,

McLean, acting as leader in the
open discussion, said he would ap-
point such a committee.

Extended “Lunch Hour”

A petition to the Executive Com.
mittee for the extension of the
lunch period was read by George
Knight. The student body voted
almost unanimously in recommend-
ing the petition to the Executive
Committee,

Once Draft-Free,
Campus Sailors
Off To High Seas

“The Navy wants youl” “You
will, if found physically qualified
.... proceed in time to arrive at
Naval Training Command, Bain-
bridge, Maryland, not later than,
nor prior to 21 April, 1952.” These
orders reverberated in the P, O.
last week as nine Davelsonians read
and reread the news that may make
gobs of them by April.

But in the grand tradition of the
Navy their motto resounds, “Don't
give up the ship! Theres’ hope yet.”

Bunny Baird, Louis Neleon,
Dave Freeman, Jim Moore,
Marshall James, Victor Taylor,
Raymond Lynch, Adrian,
Bowen, and Cam Criddlebaugh
have been called from the
Naval Reserve Division at Char-
lotte to report for active duty.
All nine of these boys have ap-

plied for deferments to finish col.
lege. The commander at Charlotte
has said that he believes deferments
are only granted on a semester
Dasis.

All these budding sailors are
from one division. One statea thar
the division had decreased about 50
per cent in size since he joined.
Eighteen were called to active duty
from this division,

The only two Davidsonians
in this division not called were
Robin Hinson and Lana Sims.
Several of the boys who were

called have applied for the Reserve
Officer's Candidate program, Under
this program a candidate goes to
‘regular meetings of the Naval Re.
serve and two training sessions in
the summer. A person would be
automatically deferred until the
completion of school if accepted in
this program.

At the present time it is a
“sit and wait” proposition until
the deferment board decides
their fate.

If they have to go it might be
possible to adopt the following
courses: (1) Drop out of school and
wait until April. (2) Consult the
Executive Committee to see iff it
would be possible to have credit
given for their courses without at-
tending classes for the rest of the
semester, or (3) have their courses |
accelerated.
