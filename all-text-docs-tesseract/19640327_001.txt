HEALING: “A MINISTRY, NOT A BUSINESS”

Oral Roberts’ Charlotte Crusade finds a charismatic pose

Oral Roberts, Faith Healer,
Holds Rewarding Crusade

“Son, I’m going to heal you and you are going to take the message of my heal-
ing power to your generation.” According to evangelist Oral Roberts, these were the
words of God spoken in a “clear, audible voice” to him as he lay near death at the
age of 17. The tubercular, stammering boy was miraculously cured of his malady and
immediately launched his career, witnessing to the healing power of faith.

Last .week Roberts was in
Charlotte conducting one of his
12 annual crusades in behalf of
the Oral Roberts Evangelistic
Association, a non profit organ-
ization with headquarters in
Tulsa, Oklahoma. Nearly four
thousand people filled the Mer-
chandise Mart on the opening
night of the crusade: no figures
have been released as yet on
total attendance or total re-
ceipts.

Roberts insists that ‘‘This is a
ministry—not a business,’’ but
whatever his terminology the
results are rewarding. In Tulsa
he has three office buildings,
the central headquarters being
housed in the seven-story, Ver-
mont marble (‘'white—for puri-
ty’) Abundant Life Building.
topped by a gold spire. The
contract for building the im-
pressive center went to one of
Roberts’ brothers.

From his paneled office,
where he sits in a $345 mold-
ed plywood chair beneath a
glowing painting of Christ,
Roberts directs a multi-mil-
lion dollar operation. His 300-
man staff distributes 57 mil-
lion pieces of Siferature a year
In 187 languages and receives
in return some 40,000 letters
each week; about 12 crusades
a year are planned; and over
$20,000 weekly is poured into
mass communications media.

Among the offices in the head-
quarters is one called the

Honorary Group
Bids Seven Frosh

The Davidson chapter of Phi
Eta Sigma, national freshman
honorary society, recently is-
sued bids to seven members of
othe Class of 1967, based on
grades compiled for the first
semester.

Freshmen receiving bids were
Rick Altemose. Steve Bales,
Walter Eastes, Hamp Morris,
Dave Purnell, Charles Rob-
ertson, and Pete VanDorsten.

Phi Eta Sigma recognizes
members of the freshman class
who have achieved a high scho-
lastic average and seeks to pro-
mote intellectual interest a-
mong students at the beginning
of their college career.

The only requirement for
membership is a 2.6 overall
grade point average, to be at-
tained either for the first semes-
ter or for the freshman year.
Those freshmen not receiving
this average for the first se-
mester may be candidates for
bids if their. yearly average
meets the requirement.

Officers of the society include
Ronnie Ayers, president: Gary
Nedwed, vice president: John
Burks, secretary:. and Tiff
Harrington, treasurer, The
faculty advisor is Dr. R. Bruce
Jackson. :

Roberts finances his opera-
tions through book sales. col-
lection barrels and his ‘‘bless-
ing pact." The latter innovation
was originated on an early cru-
sade in Kansas and has proven
highly lucrative. By the terms
of the pact, an _ individual
pledged to contribute a certain
amount monthly to the crusade
on the stipulation that his, con-
tribution would be returned to
him through some unexpected
windfall. A few requested re.
funds and their contributions
were returned. Today, Roberts
no longer includes the. stipula-
tion in his appeal.

Once a shy boy who hid on
the back porch when visitors
came, Oral Roberts is today
a confident, reasonably pol-
ished salesman. He hypnotizes
his audience with his dynam-
jc platitudes and convincing
air of certitude. Not infre-
quently, he will nervously
twist his chin up angularly,
as though his collar seems
fo tight. Roberts paces a bit
on the stage and occasionally
seems highly conscious of the
microphone before him.

His favorite expression ap-
pears to be, “God is a good
God,"' and he once noted proud-
ly that “I coined that phrase.”
Audience ‘response is initiated
through directed questions,
such as "Do you love the Lord
tonight?"’ and ‘‘Everyone who
went to Sunday School this week
say ‘Amen’.”

A member of the Pentecostal
Holiness movement, the evan-
gelist believes in personal
spiritual experiences, divine
healing of body ills and baptism
by the Holy Spirit, accompanied
by gift of tongues. .

Easily the most controversial
point of his ministry is his
faith healing ceremonies. No
confirmed miracles have been
reported from the Charlotte
crusade as yet, but there are
other reports to occupy the edi-
torial staff in Tulsa.

In 1946 Deacon Lawson, a
worker in the crusade, dropped
a motor on his foot. Roberts
lunged at his mangled shoe,
touched it and exclaimed,
“Jesus Heal!’’ When the shoe
was removed, the foot was
found to be uninjured.

Many since have claimed
that they were healed of every-
thing from terminal cancer to
diabetes, There are, however,
the tragic stories as well. One
woman in Michigan, it is re-
ported, was proclaimed by the
evangelist to be cured of dia-
betes and she threw away her

next night she was found dead
in her home.

Despite such stories, many
cling to the evangelist in near
frantic faith. One family at
the Charlotte meetings had
followed him for months but
has as yet received no at-

“Old” Bill Ferris stood
before 55 interested people
in the Morrison Room of
the Union during the volun-
tary chapel period yester-
day and announced plans
for organizing an informal
humanist club on the Dav-
idson campus.

At the last minute, Ferris
changed his plans and no offi-
cers were elected, nor was an
official statement of purpose
for the club put forward.

After the meeting, Ferris said
that he and the four other stud-
ents who were the nucleus of
the club had decided not to
unite in an official sense.

“We won't have any officers
or anything like that.’ Ferris
added. “‘What we want to be is
just a group of concerned stud
ents who want to investigate
humanism and have humanist
speakers come to the campus.”

So arf, all the club consists
of is an informal planning com-
mittee made up of Ferris, Wil-
liam Walker, Will Norman,
Wayne Rhodes, and John Mar-
tens, They will be the ones to
decide whom the humanist or-

jects prior to his flight.

ships.” A coffee hour will follow in the Union.

Either late in the afternoon or evening, he has
agreed to answer questions concerning Communism and
Russian foreign policy.

Since Myshkob is a member of the Communist Party,
he will not be able to speak at any state-supported
schools in North Carolina due to the so-called “gag law”
passed last year in the state legislature.

campus. Ferris announced at
the meeting that anyone who
wished to join the committee
would be welcome.

The 55 who attended the
first meeting came in answer
to an invitation handed out
on small slips of paper after

chapel! Tuesday. The first
sentence read, ‘All atheists,
agnostics, and  dothbting

Christlans are cordially invit-
ed to the first meeting of the
Young Humanists’ Ctub.’”’

Evidently some of the pcople
there were merely satisfying
their curiosity. Will Terry,
chaplain of the college, and Dr.
John Kelton were in attendance.

Al the meeting Ferris stated.
“Our purpose is to present a
positive alternative to Chris-
tianity on which to base our
lives. He. added that the group
hoped to. invite between three
and five speakers after the
spring break who could teach
Davidson students more about
humanism. He said that they
would probably speak during
voluntary chapel periods on
Wednesdays or Fridays.

In answer to a question from
Student Body President John
Spratt. Ferris said, ‘If later
enough students want to form
a club and draw up statements
of purpose, then we will.”
Spratt indicated after the meet-
ing that he felt the club should
organize formally and get a
charter from the Student Coun-
cil. However, after talking with
Chaplain Will Terry and var-
ious students, Spratt agreed
that it be best for the group to
remain informal.

‘iately form an official club be-
cause of the feeling among
certain individuals of the facul-
ty. administration, and student
body that a reaction against
controversial speakers might be
put into motion by the. trustees.

“Joe Howell and others seem
to feel that a formal club might
offend the Trustees at this

time,’’ commented Ferris.
Howell, YMCA president,
said, ‘Il have a certain sym

self was out of fown yester-

for comment about the new

Ferris’ definition of human-

it feels that man should focus
all attention on this world and
concern himself with simply his
own preservation.”

Ferris said that any student
could ‘join’ the informal or-
