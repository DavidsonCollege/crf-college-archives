PARK wants the library to be more than just a place to

Student committe
serves library

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

A student committee has
been formed to accept sugges-
tions and develop programs to
improve the services of the
E.H. Little Library.

The Ad Hoc Student Advi-
sory Committee to the Library
Director has eight members
and communicates directly
with Dr. Leland Park.

One of the committee’s first
duties will be to solicit sugges-
tions from students for a new
“periodicals for pleasure’’ pro-
gram.

“The academic departments
order the periodicals now in
the library,’’ explained com-
mittee member Jim Entwistle.

‘Money is available to order

periodicals that people can

read purely for pleasure—act-
ivity-oriented or special-inter-
est publications.

“If any students have sug-
gestions for such ‘pleasure
reading’, please tell the com-
mittee.

“This program reflects Dr.
Park’s desire to make the

library a pleasant place to:

come when a student has free
time, not just a place to
study.”

Other members of the com-
mittee are: Mark Scandling,
Joe Craig, Robert Carlton,

Anne Wicker, Ralph Yielding,

Ben Simms, and Holmes Har-
den.

wavidson receives Grarii;=
foresees faculty growth

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
Asst. News Editor

The Mellon Foundation
granted Davidson College
$230,000 to be used primarily
for faculty development.

Vice-President of Academic
Affairs, Frontis Johnston, is
chairman of a committee re-
sponsible for appropriating
the money.

He said that Davidson was
probably selected for the grant
because the college was inter-
ested in faculty development
and this goal coincided with a
goal of the Mellon Foundation
at the time of the grant.

“They are providing means
for our faculty member to
recharge their batteries, con-
tinue their professional
growth, and to continue with
new ideas in their particular
fields.’’

Johnston’s committee has
not decided where all, the
money will go, but it has
allotted portions of it to
programs concerning outside

examiners, the Honors Center, ,

and the Humanities program.

The function of the outside
examiners, usually professors
from Duke or UNC, is to give
oral examinations to econ-
omics majors, part of their
major requirements.

The money going to the

Humanities program will-fund
a review of that program. A
team of faculty members will.
devote five weeks of the
summer to evaluating Hu-
manities and writing a new
syllabus.

In addition to these prog-
rams, the committee is consid-
ering ten or twelve other
applications from faculty
members.

Johnston remarked, ‘‘I
want to leave a good deal (of
money) for the next person,”
referring to the next commit-
tee chairman. Johnston is

retiring at the end of the year.

Some of the proposals under
consideration include more
sabbaticals, faculty exchanges
with other schools (possibly
European), and faculty com-
puter courses.

“I believe the continual
growth in members of our
faculty is vital to the quality
of our program in the present
and the future.

“Without means to encour-
age and stimulate further
scholarship and research, the
quality of our program would

suffer,’’ Johnston concluded.

Senior class leaves dramatic gift

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor

The 1977 Senior Class has
chosen a portable electronic
dimming system for the Dra-
ma Department as their class
gift.

Drama professor Joe Gard-
ner says the compact and
portable dimmer system will
enable the Drama Department
to ‘‘change the Drama Work-
shop adjacent to Hodson Hall
into a totally flexible experien-
tial theatre for student-produ-
ced plays.”

The system, which will cost
$2400, will be able to be
located anywhere in the room
and will “maintain the initial
purpose of flexibility and still
allow for a great deal of
creative experimentation on

the part of students in-
volved,’’ Gardner adds.

“Furthermore, such a sys-
tem can be moved temporarily
to other facilities, such as the
new Schoolhouse of the Arts.”

The gift was chosen by a
committee headed by Senior
Class President Tony Snow
and consisting of Ken Chad-
wick, Tom Cooper, Sabra
Faires, Pat Hudson, Chuck
Kennon, Jeff Morrow, Mark
Rabil, Mark Scandling, Tim
Sellers, Jeff Sich, Ruth Mur-
phy, John Allen Tucker, and
Cory Young.

They chose the dimmer
system because they felt it
would enable the class to make
a critical contribution to the
college.

As Tom Bernhardt, Direc-
tor of the Living Endowment,

commented, “‘The growth of
drama in the next five years
depends upon the experiential
Drama Workshop room. The
first step in making that room
available is the lighting.”’

Other suggestions which
were overruled were lights for
the tennis courts, giving Herb
Jackson $2000 to purchase a
piece of artwork from a New
York Auction, and a magazine
subscription or book acquisi-
tion fund.

Bernhardt feels the only
objection to the choice of the
dimmer board over the other
suggestions is the dimmer
board only effects a small part
of the school.

Gardner answers the objec-
tion by pointing out, ‘Theatre
at Davidson has grown to the
point where it now represents

one of the most popular extra-

pus, involving about fifteen
percent of the student body
with a healthy turnover from
year to year. Audience atten-
dance for 1975-76 reached over

4600 and this figure is still
growing.”

The committee hopes to
raise the money from the class
by the spring production so
they can see the dimmer board
in effect.
