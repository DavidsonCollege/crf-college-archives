for Wake Forest, each securing two
bingles. Cassell was the outstanding
star for the Wildcats, securing three
hits out of five attempts. Cassell also
fielded one hundred per cent, handling
six out of six chances. The Raleigh
News and Observer ranks him as the
best short stop in the state.

were J. F. Clark and L. P. Burney on
the affirmative, and G. N. Morrow with
J. I. Knight on the negative.

The affirmative based its argument on
the following points: First, that we
should co-operate for political reasons ;
second, that we. must do this to improve
our business relations; and third, that
we can trust these nations to do the best
for all concerned.

In opposition to these points the neg-
ative upheld their side of the question
with the arguments that this move
would be contrary to the Monroe Doc-
trine, that the United States can handle
this matter better alone, and that pre-
vious experience has shown that these
nations are not to be trusted in a mat-
ter of this kind. The decision was two
to one for the negative.

The critic announced the query for the
extemporaneous debate: “Resolved, that
the Faculty should have left exams be-
fore Christmas as they were” The
affrmative, upheld by McCain, argued
that the old system had been beneficial
to both the students and faculty. But
McLeod in opposition to this proposal
argued that the new system would be
beneficial to the students, it would
equalize the school year, and the rating
of Davidson would be helped. The de-
cision was two to one for the affirma-
tive.

At this point the president announced
April 28th as the time for the election
of officers for the coming year.

Query closed the literary program
with a very instructive oration on va-
rious superstitions prevalent today.

Those who had never ridden in an
imaginary aeroplane were given a ride
for the amusement of the others as well
as for the personal sensation. Various
other games both new and old were en-
tered into with great spirit. Refresh-
ments’ were also enjoyed and the oc-
casion was pronounced a great success.
