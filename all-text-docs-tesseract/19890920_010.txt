Women’s soccer sets Davidson records

\

Wildcats maim Presbyterian
9-0 at first home game

You couldn’ task fora better way to start women’s soccer at Davidson. Fans who crowded
the bleachers to see the first home game were not disappointed when the Wildcats
butchered Presbyterian in a merciless 9-0 victory.

Sophomore Liz Clarke led the crusade with 3 goals and 1 assist. Freshman Ann Todd was
chosen Athlete of the Week after scoring the first goal in Davidson’s short history of
women’s soccer against Erskine last week. Todd played a strong game against Presbyterian
with 2 goals and 1 assist. Sophomore Lindsey Forsythe also scored 2 goals in the game.

Last year, when I began

"writing this column, a per-.
son of no real importance
said to me, “Who the heck
do you think you are telling
everybody how to eat and
exercise?”

True, lam no more quali-
fied to write thisarticle than’
are the fat, pork-bellied,
beer drinkers who wear
their cut-off Duckhead
shorts down to theirankles.
And I amno more qualified
to write this article than are
the 90 percent of females
who wear tee-shirts (also
down to the ankles) in at-
tempts to cover, their ole-
aginous fundaments (what-
ever happened to the mini-

_ skirt?). Given the chance,
anybody could write a
similar weekly article.

Why, then am I doing
this? What qualifies me to
write this column?

I read magazines and
books about fitness and I
exercise incessantly. These

When you are happy with

don’t really matter.”

Tip O’ the Week

There are two basic tenets =
paramount to good health:

1) Exercise regularly (aero-
bically 3 times a week); 2)
and eat the right foods

(more grains, more fresh

fruits and vegetables, more
cereals; less saturated fats,
less sauce embellishments--

“dressings, butter, and may-
- onnaise--less sugar and

cholesterol).
- Scrutinize labels of prod-
ucts. Ask about foods.

Field hockey defeats High Point, then falls to Duke

By TRACEY-LYNN PEREZ

The Lady Wildcats opened the field
hockey season with a 3-0 victory over
High Point last week. The victory
marked the first time in over five years
that Davidson was able to defeat the
Purple Panthers in High Point.

Monique Dockter registered the first

score of the game on a penalty corner;
she wasassisted by Laura Follmer. Gigi
Cooke was the game’s high scorer with
two goals in the second half, one on an
assist by Mary Russ.

After that strong start, the team spent
a weekend in Catawba: at the Fall
Umpiring Clinic. The clinic, which fea-

their opponents an opportunity to play
together for the first time. Davidson
was very competitive, finishing with
four wins and one tie.

Next the team faced Duke on the
astroturf in Durham and fell 0-4. The
loss was attributed to the Wildcats’
unfamiliarity with thedifferent playing
skills needed on turf. Luckily for
Davidson, the game does not count
against the team’s seeding in the Deep

Francesca Fierro once again proved
to be a strong, aggressive and reliable
sweeper. Her outstanding defensive
play was aided by goalie Elizabeth
Dahm, who performed sensationally
under pressure. Dahm made 20 saves
in the first half.

Coach Betsy Pryor and the rest of the
team look forward to meeting the Blue
Devils once again, when the Wildcats
can play on the grass at Davidson.
