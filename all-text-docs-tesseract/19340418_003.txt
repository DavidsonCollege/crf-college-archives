Beaty Makes Talks
To New Y Cabinet

President and Cabinet of Y. M.
C. A. Installed at Vesper
Service

MORROW MAKES TALK

New Officers to Take Over Their
Duties at Once

The Davidson Y. M. C. A. held its
installation service at the Sunday, ves-
pers, April 15. The newly-elected
president, W. P. Sprunt, and the cab-
inet of the Y. M. C. A,, were installed,
immediately taking over the duties of
their new offices,

Rk. C. Morrow gave an address en-
titled “From the Old ‘Y’ Cabinet.” He
first expressed thanks to Sam Wiley
and W. M. Thompson for their work
and fulfillment of the duties of their
respective offices. He pointed out the
importance of the position the cabinet
had entrusted to them.

“The greatest sin of Davidson stu-
dents is the sin of indifference,” he
stated. “The realization that Christ is
a loving power who is able to guide
us is necessary to combat indifference.”

Professor Ernest Beaty gave a talk
next on “ Charge to the New Cabinet.”
He expressed the importance that
Christian colleges play in carrying out
Christian work today. “All forces
which motivate Davidson students are
towards Christianity, and the -Y. M.
C, A. is one of the strongest forces,”
he said.

He challenged the cabinet, as its defi-
nite objective, to make every Davidson
man a true follower of Christianity.
“Man must live a wholesome and sane
life in accordance with Christ, and he
must study out problems, to act right-
ly, to have the spirit of Christianity.”

Sprunt gave the final talk of the in-
stallation, service. He accepted the
challenges given by Morrow and Pro-
fessor Beaty, and stated that his aim
was to fulfill the duties left to him.
“My hope is that opportunities for
service may be carried out; and
through the medium of this service, the
students will be benefitted,” he said

Dr. J. R. Cunningham
Speaks On Ministry

Speaker Discusses Requirements
of a Good Minister

The Davidson Y. M. C. A. continued
its vocational guidance work with a
talk by John R. Cunningham, D.D., to
the candidates for the ministry on
Tuesday, April 10. At that time he
presented a resume of the field of min-
istry and the training necessary for the
minister of today.

Before an audience of about twenty-
five or thirty men assembled in Pro-
fessor Bailey’s classroom, Dr. Cun-
ningham, president of the Louisville
Presbyterian Seminary at Louisville,
Ky., spoke for an hour and a quarter
on the ministry as a profession,

The whole field of ministry was dis-
cussed, particularly the specific quali-
fications of the minister,..the courses
he should study in college and sem-
inary, and the natural. requisites of a
minister. Dr. Cunningham's most’ sur-
prising view, to his listeners, was his
emphasis on the need of a ministerial
student for as many courses in psy-
chology as possible. Throughout the
lecture, questions from the students
were answered,

Either teaching or engineering will
be the next profession to be discussed
through the “Y.” A speaker on one
of the vocations will be secured for
some evening next week.

Tuesday’s address marked the fourth
profession which the “ Y” has had dis-
cussed during its vocational guidance
program; two or three more lectures
of the sort will be conducted this year.
At the end of this program, there will
be published in “The Davidsonian” a
bibliography on vocations in general
and specific professions.

Present “Spitfire”

Cinema Starring Hepburn Will
Be Shown Tonight

Wednesday, April 18—Spitfire
Katherine Hepburn is presented in
probably her best role up' to the pres-
ent time. She plays the part of the
young country girl, Trigger, who is a
religious ‘fanatic. She makes a won-
derful characterization of this simpte
country lass, and her acting in the part
is outstanding. With her in the lead-
ing part is Robert Young. This pic-
ture shows that it is not her looks that
makes her a great star, but her good
acting and her attractive personality.

Bottoms Up

This is a new film and a new star,
and both appear to be very good. Pat
Paterson is the young girl who seems
to be quickly climbing the heights, in
this, her initial starring role. This is
the story of three men leading a girl
to happiness and love. The cast in-
cludes Spencer Tracy, John Boles, who
manages to sing again in the picture,
and Herbert Mundin. There is acting,

The evening sermon was preached by

all the services of the day.

humor, and music combined to make
a good show.

Saturday, April 21—Devil Tiger

At last we have a show without hu-
man stars. This is another of, and
presumably the best, of the wild ani-
mal pictures. The scenes are.thrilling,
and the action real, with nothing but
genuine wild animals in the starring
positions, The lives and actions of
some of the most ferocious killers of
the jungles are shown in bona fide pic-
tures.
Monday, April 23—Gambling Lady

Barbara Stanwyck is starred with a
perfect supporting cast, and a picture
is shown with hardly anything left to
be desired. Pat O’Brien and Joel Mc-
Crea are the men, and they fit in ex-
actly right. Miss Stanwyck is the hon-
est daughter of an honest father who
died rather than join with a crooked
mob. His daughter gambles, but hon-
estly, and wins, after joining with a
mob of big-time gamblers. All goes
well until she falls in love with Joel
McCrea, of Park Avenue, and then the
action starts. There are a few dull
spots, but the acting is good.

Tuesday, April 24—Laughing Boy

This show is so new that there is no
information on it. Ramon Novarro
comes to the screen again in a western
role, and with him is Lupe Velez. If
he sings enough, the show is certain
to be good,
