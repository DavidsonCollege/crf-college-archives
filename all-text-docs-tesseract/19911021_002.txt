Schultz Discusses NCAA Reform

By Bruce Balestier

Dick Schultz, the Executive
Director of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, spoke Fri-
day night to an audience of about
four hundred people at Belk Arena
on the past, present and future of
the NCAA.

Schultz worked with Davidson
Athletic Director Terry Holland
from 1981-87, when Schultz was
the Athletic Director and Holland
the Head Basketball Coach at the
University of Virginia.

Atthecenter of Schultz’ speech
were the results of arecent NCAA
survey, consisting of personal inter-
views with a group of 4,000 ran-
domly selected college athletes.

The consensus of those ath-

letes was threefold; first, that they.

didn’t have “enough time to be the
kind of students [they] want[ed] to
be;” second, that they didn’t have
“enough time in the off-season to
do what other students do;” and
third, that they suffered from a
pervasive feeling of isolation.

Schultz outlined the NCAA’s
ongoing platform of reform in
response to that survey. At last
year’s NCAA Convention, the
delegates voted to limit the num-
ber of hours an athlete could de-
vote to his or her sport per week to
20, and voted to eradicate: over a
period of 5 years athletic dormito-
ries and training tables, those things
which contribute most to the ath-
lete’s sense of isolation from the
student body as a whole.

Schultz stated ‘that it was the
NCAA’s goal “to make the stu-
dent-athlete an integral part of the
student body, and undistinguish-
able from the rest of the student
body.” To that end, Schultz pre-
dicts that academic reforms will
highlight the 1992 NCAA Con-
vention, perhaps led by a tighten-
ing of freshman eligibility require-
ments.

Presently, an incoming fresh-
man qualifies to play with a 700
SAT score and a 2.0 GPA in 11
core classes. Proposed legislation,
likely, according to Schultz, to be
enacted at next year’s convention,

would raise that standard to a 2.5
GPA in 13 core courses.

In addition, Schultz supports
thecreation of acertification proc-
ess for athletic departments which
would help ensure that admissions
procedures and academic criteria
for athletes were similar to that of
the student body at large. “We want
to be sure we have bona-fide stu-
dent-athletes, notathlete-students,”

_ he said.

“Colleges and universities
were not established as farm clubs
of the NBA, or the NFL or Major
League Baseball,” said Schultz.
“Our first responsibility, if we
recruit young men and women and
bring them to campus, is to make

sure that when they leave thay are,

well-educated, have a degree and
are prepared to be contributors to
society.”

Schultz also talked at some

length about the relationship of |

the media to college athletics. He
characterized excessive media
coverage of the troubles of so-

called bad athletes as a “lightning
rod” for generalizations, . and
pointed out the results of a recent
NCAA survey.

Inthat survey, whichdealt with
270,000 participating college ath-
letes, the number that reasonably
could be labelled bad or troubled
fell well short of 1% of the total.

Of particular interest to
Davidson, Schultz discussed
briefly the concept of Division I-
AAA, the proposed new NCAA
division for schools like Davidson
which play at the Division ITI level
in football but at the Division I
level in all other sports.

He said there was significant
opposition to I-AAA from Divi-
sion II andI-AA schools concerned
that I-AAA schools could save
money by playing Division III
football (since Division III awards
no scholarships) and use those
savings to advance their basketball
programs. He now regards the
proposal as a “toss-up vote” at the
1992 Convention.

tity.

Barber pointed out several rea-
‘sons, geographic, cultural, eco-
nomic, and political, why the U.S.
and Europe view the Soviet Union
so differently. The threat from the
Soviet Union, Barber noted, is no
longer based in military strength,
but in instability, and Americans
tend to approach the problem dif-
ferently than Europeans.

The American tradition of self-
help and determination is not nec-
essarily a tenet of European life,
Barber pointed out, and this dis-
crepancy will be the grounds for
several differences in policy.

The American presence, ac-
cording to Barber, is still neces-
sary and positive in Europe despite
its_current military irrelevance.
Barber called the “Fortress Eu-

Barber was educated at St.
Edmund’s Hall of Oxford Univer-
sity, where he received his joint
degrees in German and Modern
History. In addition to his work
with the Financial Times, Barber
has co-authored two books, The
Price of Truth and Not Without
Honor, and has appeared on sev-
eral television news programs to
provide commentary. In 1981
Barber received Britain’s Out-
standing Young Journalist Award.
He has worked for the Financial
Times since 1986.
