The Davidsonian

Prospective wondering why there aren’t
as many minority students as on Website

‘Oh, I’m sure
they’re sleeping’
says tour guide

GREY HOUSE—Visiting high school se-
nior Michelle Dylan thought Davidson
was everything she’d always imagined as
she crossed campus on the 1:30 tour this
Monday: tall trees, red bricks, abundant
SUVs. And yet, something was missing.
There were so many minority students on
the college website—where were they
now?

Her query is not a new one. Through-

Here at Davidson
we have literally
dozens of non-
white students.

out the past year, an increasing number of
prospective students and their parents
have been expressing sentiments of con-
fusion over Davidson’s outward portrayal
of diversity.

Fortunately, admissions officials
couldn’t be less concerned. “Here at
Davidson we have a remarkably diverse
student body, with literally dozens of non-
white students,” said Howard Brooks,
special director of diversity recruitment in
the admissions office. “Now the whole
world can finally see the true reality of
Davidson’s commitment to diversity. We
don’t just have heart—we’ve got soul.”

The college homepage, located on-line
at www.davidson.edu, was outfitted last
semester with a new database of ran-
domly-loading photos highlighting
Davidson’s diverse student-body. While
previous photos featured only token mi-
norities amidst a sea of white students,
the current images feature a minority-to-
Caucasian ratio grossly disproportionate
to the actual racial distribution on cam-

process, frequent inclusion in college bro-
chures, and numerous appointments to
panels for visiting high-schoolers.

In further appreciation, the admissions
office hosted a diversity picnic this Satur-
day, which was filmed for use in a new
video for prospective students. Among the
students invited was Devon James ’04,
who was even permitted by admissions
officials to bring a few guests. “Mr. Brooks

pus.

“This is truly a step in the right direc-
tion,” Brooks continued while hitting the
homepage ‘refresh’ button a whole bunch
of times on his computer screen. “We still
have some room to improve in terms of
minority enrollment, but these new pho-
tos confirm just how seriously
we take diversity here at
Davidson.”

The photos were uploaded
onto the site by Marty Bohner,
a recently employed web de-
signer in the College Commu-
nications office, who comes to
Davidson with experience at
Gettysburg College and the
University of Vermont.

“It’s great to work among
such an incredibly diverse stu-
dent body,” Bohner com-
mented. “When I was at UVM
we had to digitally add minori-
ties to our publication graphics
with Adobe Photoshop. It’s
just so much more convenient
when you have real, living
non-white students to work
with.” Bohner went on to ex-
plain that, despite some rumor
to the contrary, all non-white
students on Davidson’s
webpage were in fact photo-
graphed on Davidson’s cam-
pus at one time or another.
“These were all real photos
printed on actual paper and
scanned with an actual scan-
ner,” he said,

In appreciation of the diver-
sity they bring to campus,
Brooks and his admissions
staff have pledged their dedi-
cation to minority students
here at Davidson. Minorities
have enjoyed an array of spe-
cial privileges, such as a spe-
cialized freshman orientation

was really excited about meeting my
roommates, so I felt sort of bad when I
had to tell him they were away for the
weekend,” said James. “But he was really
understanding, and said I could just bring

_ some of my friends from the BSC. Al-

though that’s odd, because I’m not even in
the BSC.”

The picnic, described by the admis-
sions department as a “dazzling multi-
hued success,” was a true showcase of
diversity at Davidson. Brooks also took
the opportunity to point out, however,
that “diversity comes in forms other than
skin color.”

“I saw one guy who was at least 6’5”
there tonight,” Brooks exclaimed follow-
ing the event. “You should have seen it, he
was standing next to this girl who must
have been under 5 feet tall. I just chuckled
to myself and thought, ‘If that isn’t diver-
sity personified, then I don’t know what
is.” .

Despite Davidson’s strong commit-
ment to diversity, admissions officials
assure students that the campus still
boasts plenty of non-minorities, also
known as ‘white guys.’ In fact, white guys
can be seen just about anywhere on cam-
pus grounds, where they engage in any
number of white guy activities, be it
throwing Frisbees, walking entirely too
quickly to class, or playing mediocre Dave
Matthews on acoustic guitars.

“Davidson certainly has the best of
both worlds,” commented Lauren Field-
