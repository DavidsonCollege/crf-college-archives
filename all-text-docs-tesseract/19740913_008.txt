With the help of funds
donated by the Davidson Wild-
cat Club, the Cat Basketball
team will be playing on a.new
rubberized gym floor this
year. Due to be completed by
Oct. 1, the beige with black
and red trimmed Tartan sur-
face will hopefully provide a
more efficient playing sur-
face.

According to Davidson
Sports Information Director
Emil Parker, ‘Last year the
budget was unable to afford
the new floor, so the Wildcat
Club raised the necessary

. $64,000.” ;

Davidson Basketball Coach
Bo Brickels is also extremely
pleased with the new Tartan
surface. ‘I think that new sur-
face will not only benefit the
performances of the players,
but it will definitely aid in
recruiting,’’ Brickels said.

Wildcat Cagers To Play |
On New Gym Flooring

At present, the gym floor is
only concrete. The concrete
must set for a period of
roughly 28 days after it has
been poured.

“With this new floor ad-
ditional striping may be put
down for IMAC basketball and
volleyball games,” said
Parker.

The new gym floor is not the
only improvement planned for
Johnston Gymnasium. Con-
struction is now underway for
three offices and a conference
room downstairs.

The offices will house
Wrestling Coach Charles
Parker, Director of Physical
Education Chip Stone, and the
new Director of Women’s
Physical Education Pat
Drake. :

In addition to these im-
provements, plans are being
considered for the
redecoration of the back wall
of the gym.

.. Administrative Changes

(Continued from page 1)

The two will be replaced by
Brenda Parnell and Duff
Bruce. Parnell has recently
served as admissions secre-
tary for Duke University Law
School, while Bruce has
served as assistant to the pres-,
ident and assistant director of
the College Union, respective-
ly during the past two years.

“It is a real advantage to
have someone in the ad-
missions department who has
a real knowledge of what the
college is and a devotion to it,
both qualities which Duff
has,”’ Spencer said.

With such a_ background,

al.

Spencer feels Brice is in a
position ‘‘to interpret the «
campus” for prospective stu-
dents.

Strong’s new position was a
move upward, as Wake Forest
has a large information staff
with its own printing facilities.
Strong will be replaced by
Martha Byrd. Spencer in-
dicated that Davidson is
“really fortunate to have
her.”” She has written. two’
books as well as edited several
publications. ‘‘Her credentials
certainly rate her well for the
position,’’ Spencer said.

Two members of the ad-
missions department left
Davidson during ‘“e summer.
William Miller accepted the
responsibilities of director of
financial aid at Old Dominion |
University, while: Mariam
Nolan returned -to graduate
school at Harvard University.
