Davidson Officer
Dies In Collision

Davidson police officer Steven
Richard Strejc, 29, was killed at 6:45
a.m. on Monday when a van driven by
Richard Giles of Mooresville collided
head-on with his 1974 Volkswagen.

Strejc was traveling north on N.C.
115 when Giles swerved into the oppo-
site lane of traffic to avoid hitting a car
that was turning into a private drive. The
accident occurred approximately two
miles north of the Davidson town limits.

Strejc, off duty at the time of the acci-
dent, had just completed his morning de-
livery of the Charlotte Observer and was
going to get breakfast.

Davidson officer Raymond Thrower
arrived at the scene approximately two
minutes after the accident and reported
that Strejc had no pulse at that time and
had apparently died on impact.

Davidson Police Chief Jack Warlitk
said, “Steve had served for the entire
period that I have been with the Davidson

Police Departn ent and had a spotless
employment record for the total period of
his employment. He was held in my
highest regard for his professional ability
and as a person. I personally feel that the
Town of Davidson has suffered a great
loss.”

Hal Kluttz, a former Davidson police
officer, reflecting on his acquaintance
with the deceased both as a personal
friend and co-worker, said, “Steve! was
real easy going and easy to work with.
He had a lot of compassion in the way he
handled his job. It was a shock.”

Cliff Archer, of Archer’s Texaco and
Wrecker Service, said, “He was a really
fine fellow. If I had to work late, or was
called out at night on a job, Steve would
always drop around ‘to see that every-
thing was all right.”

Cornelius Sgt. Terry DeRhodes said,
“We never heard any complaints about
him from anyone. If you needed him for

backup, he was thee when he was called
or before.”

Funeral services for Strejc were held
Wednesday at Hankins & Whittington in
Charlotte. Davidson police served as
pallbearers and the Comelius and David-
son College police were honorary
pallbearers.
