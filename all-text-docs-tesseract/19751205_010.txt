* search for Academic VP

By CATHY LANDIS
Asst. Features Editor

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. hopes to fill the
position of Vice President for
Academic Affairs by March 1,
1976.

As Frontis W. Johnston
temporarily fills the position
vacated last summer by John
M. Bevan, Spencer has _nar-
rowed the list of applicants for
the position considerably with
the assistance of Faculty Exe-
cutive Committee member
Cora L. Nelson. The entire
Faculty Executive Committee
is now reviewing the creden-
tials of those 20 nominees.

The selection process began
by requesting nominations
from trustees, faculty, admi-
nistration, alumni and stu-
dents. 240 men and women
were nominated and_ sub-
mitted resumes and. referen-
ces.

The select few

Subsequently, Spencer and
Nelson selected about 20 from
this list, submitting the names
of the nominees and their
credentials to the Faculty
Executive Committee. After
review by the Executive
Committee, Spencer will select
those from the list to be
invited to the campus for
interviews.

THE INTERBANK CARD

Who offers a Master Charge Card to Davidson students?
Piedmont Bank and Trust Company.

is there a minimum age requirement?
Yes, you must be 18 years of age to
have the card in your name alone.

Is there any minimum income requirement?
No. No one is excluded from any Pied-
mont Bank service due to a pre-deter-
mined minimum annual income.

Why would | want a Master Charge Card?
Good for identification; it will make
cashing a check much easier. Dining
out, travel or emergencies make hav-
ing a Master Charge Card worthwhile.
Safer than carrying cash, reduces the
need for and cost of travelers checks.

When does my Master Charge Card expire?
All. student Master Cards expire in
June 1976. Cards will automatically be
renewed unless specific instructions

to the contrary are given in advance
You will have your card for summer
travel and we encourage seniors to
continue to carry a Piedmont Master
Charge Card wherever they go.

Why did Piedmont Bank design a Student

Master Charge Program?

A 1970 survey of Davidson College
seniors indicated that students wanted
a Master Charge Card. Piedmont
Bank’s long and satisfactory experi-
ence with Davidson students assured
us that our faith in the students was
justified, and finally, it is the only ser-
vice of our bank that was not being
offered to students. We ask for your
deposits and we should be willing to
provide you the tool for credit!

Piedmont Bank in no way encourages the student to use
the Card for spending beyond his or her budget. We hope
it will be a convenience to you and will cause you to use Pied-
mont Bank for checking and-savings both now and in the
future. It is also our hope that Piedmont Master Charge will
go with you as you leave Davidson College.

PIEDMONT BANK AND TRUST COMPANY

MEMBER FDIC

Upon the candidates’ arri-
vals, representatives of stu-
dents, senior staff officers,
members of the Trustees Exe-
cutive Committee will inter-
view them.

The opinions of these
groups will be submitted in
writing to the President and
the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee. The Committee will
then give the President a list
of no fewer than three but no
more than five that they feel to
be the strongest possibilities.

After consultation with
Trustee rrepresentatives, es-
pecially the Chairman of the
Board and the Chairman of the
Education Committee, Spen-
cer will make a nomination to
the trustees and send it along
with the list drawn up by the
Executive Committee of the
Faculty.

The President indicated
that Davidson is looking for
someone who is a mature
scholar with proven leadership
abilities and classroom teach-
ing experience. He wishes the
individual to have an under-
standing of a liveral arts edu-
cation as well as education-
ally-related financial matters.

He sent a list of these
qualities as well as subsequent
recommended ones to all those
involved in the selection pro-
cess.

Church relations

Other criteria include an
appreciation of both the col-
lege’s regional as well as
national and international res-
ponsibilities and understand-
ing and support for the col-
lege’s relationship with the
church. The job description
emphasizes the dual respons-
ibility of the position to the
faculty and to the President,
with professional faculty deve-
lopment a major
bility.

Most of all, the person,
according to Spencer, should
be open to change and under-
stand that ‘‘the most effective
leadership is grounded in a
selfless desire to serve the
institution and its people.

Although all of these cha-
racteristics are not prere-
quisite to obtaining the posi-
tion, Spencer does hope to find
a person who has the best
combination of these qualities.
