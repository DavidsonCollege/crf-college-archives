Shell Game

One of the arguments used Monday
night at a special meeting held by the
Student Body Constitution revision
committee to support its product was
that Davidson is, after all, one com-
munity, and we should aim for a cam-
pus-wide government.

While we were gratified to hear
those familiar words, it occurs to us
that, in this particular case, the old
Davidson word game has once again
taken on the proportions of a shell
game.

The particular provision which was
being defended by the committee was
Article IV, Section 4: ‘The student
shall be as free as possible from regu-
lation not directly relevant to his edu-
cation. The standards of conduct shall
be formulated with significant student
participation.”

It had' been suggested that the last
sentence of this section be changed to
read, “The rules of student conduct
shall be formulated by students.”

Then here came the campus gov-
ernment bandwagon in all of its glory
to be driven down the wrong road as
committee members claimed that such
a change would violate the good of
setting up an integrated community.

There are three ways that student
discipline could be handled:

The present system could be retain-
ed. Now the students are allowed to
run around making rules, while the
faculty and administration determine
which of those rules shall be obeyed
and what additional rules shall also be
obeyed. The student body can only
write pretty documents requesting
changes.

Secondly, the one community con-
cept could be used. Here the dicho-
tomy of the present rule structure
would be eliminated. In an integrated
community, all members should help
determine what rules are needed to
govern that society. Logically, if the
Students and faculty share responsi-

bility for determining the rules gov-
erning private student conduct, then
they should also write rules governing
the private lives of faculty members.

The third alternative would be for
the faculty to determine what rules
are necessary for their private lives
and for the students would be respon-
sible for the conduct of their private

ves.

Davidson College, by virtue of its
small size if nothing else, does throw
the faculty, administration and stu-
dent body into one society, sharing
many communal interests. Among
these common concerns are the curri-
culum, the official college relationship
with the Presbyterian Church and the
financing of the college program.

All members of the college com-
munity should share the responsibility
for these things because all are af-

fected directly by them. The private

conduct of students and faculty mem-
bers, however, is not such an issue.
Each group should determine what
rules are necessary to give order to
its own method of living. The fact that
students are all racked together in the
close society of storage bins known as
dormitories would mean that the stu-
dent body would have to impose
tighter restrictions upon itself than
does the faculty living in a more nor-
mal civil society. These restrictions,
however, should be legislated by the
student body because it is the group
affected by them.

The committee made no substan-
tial effort to apply the concept of
campus government to other parts of
the student government. Only here,
where the idea is not applicable, did
it seek to use the language of campus
government. By claiming that the fac-
ulty should make the rules for student
conduct, the revision committee is
trying to pass the buck for what
should be a student responsibility.

Faculty Kill-Joys

Wouldn't you know the faculty would find a way to mess up a fun thing
like writing editorials for THE DAVIDSONIAN?

After all the time we spent late at night sharpening the invective keys
on our editorial typewriter (that’s the one with the ‘‘we” key where other
typewriters have an “i”), after all that time, the faculty decided to make

ROTC non-compulsory.

Now all we can do is compliment them on a wise decision, and, gee

whiz, that’s no fun at all.

‘Schizo’ Students

As we read the report of Blue Sky
subcommittee on student life, we seem
to find implicit in many of its criti-
cisms of Davidson student life a belief
that the Davidson student is really
“schizo” as a result of the fragmenta-
tion of the educational process.

Since the adjective ‘“‘schizo” is our
own and not the committee’s, we had
better define our terms (a Davidson
fetish, not limited to editorial writers
exclusively) so that all will know what
we mean.

Realizing first of all that the defini-
tion of the term “schizo” resides ulti-
mately in our “Judeo-Christian heri-
tage” (a term we have heard before
somewhere but cannot define), we will
simply say that the term parallels in
the student’s life what the Humanities
Department has decided is “overde-
partmentalization” in the curriculum.

We know of no better way to side-
step the question of defining the term
“schizo” than by relating it to the
Humanities Department, thereby ob-
scuring the issue beyond all possibility
of concise definition.

Now that we have “passed the buck”
about our definition of “schizo” —
“pass the buck” may be defined by
any number of people in any number
of places on campus — we can get on
to the subject at hand. The Student
Life Subcommittee’s report says that
the “educational process is total” and,
ideally, unfragmented into academic
and social categories.

Unfortunately such fragmentation
does exist and produces the schizo Da-
vidson student. The dorms are places
where students are stored when not in
use, says the committee. They serve
no purpose. They merely lie passively
between the academic extreme on the
hill pnd the social extreme on the
court.

The Hill is a place where students
are exercised intellectually every
morning. The fraternity court is a
corresponding place where the stu-
dents are exercised socially, thus pro-
ducing the liberal Davidson gentleman
whom we all know and love.

The problem with this fragmenta-
tion is, for the subcommittee, a simple
problem of a lack of diversification in

a student’s contacts. The barriers be-
tween what educates and what relaxes
never are broken down: The Davidson
student has an innate distrust, there-
fore, of his relationship to academics.

On the Hill, he feels like a wage-
earner who has been cheating on the
timeclock. He is afraid the boss will
find out he has not been putting in
enough.-hours on the job. On the other
hand, at the fraternity house, he may
be accepted “for what he is.” The
fraternity house is a way of getting
away from academic pressures.

However, there are 12 different
fraternities with 12 different attitudes
toward their relationships to the Hill
as well as with each other. The bar-
riers between students and the Hill are
complemented by the barriers between
social fraterntiy and the Hill. And the
barriers between various social fra-
ternities are too well known even to
discuss.

Therefore, the Davidson student is
schizo. There are all sorts of arbitrary
unspoken rules defining relationships
of students and faculty, students and
students. What it seems to us the
Blue Sky subcommittee is calling for
is a feeling of community at Davidson.

The Davidson community is an in-
tricately stratified structure existing
on the academic and social planes.
Both planes create obstacles which
prohibit the kind of interaction be-
tween faculty and student body that is
necessary to the real concept of com-
munity which should exist.

What the subcommittee offers
seems to be the best solution: remodel-
ing the dorms, renovation and fuller
use of fraternity facilities, and the
creation of a College Union which
would provide a “meeting point of the
curriculum and the extra-curriculum.”

It is only by integrating the present
social structure into some meaningful
relationship to the academic realm
that Davidson students can, for
the first time, discover the mean-
ing of an academic community, a place
in which interacting minds enjoy a
congenial relationship, not on the basis
of the wage-earner and the boss, but
on the basis of a mutual commitment
to knowledge and understanding.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Reed Cites Program’s Weakness

Dear Editor.

It’s hard for me to write
this letter. After helping to
organize the Richardson Fel-
lows program last spring, 1
find it difficult to express my
critcism of its activities.
Since I have resigned from
the program, however, I feel
that an explanation is in ord-
er. Also, 1 am writing in hope
that the Richardson Fellows
will recognize and deal with
the serious flaws which, in
my opinion, must surely re-
sult in the failure and death
of the prograni.

I have two basic cricitisms
of the Richardson Fellows’
activities as they now exist.
First, the program has no
adult adviser. Despite the
fact. that Mike Mooty is a
capable individual. I am con-
vinced that no student can be
expected to administer a $20.,-
000-per-year program, the
goal of which he himself
must define, while at the
same time he inspires 12
students and teaches them
“how to succeed". The di-
rector of such a program
must be a man of age and
experience: ho must be an
“insider’’ with regard to the
faculty: he must have train-
ing. in the evaluation of
young people. Needless to
say, the Davidson Richard-
son Fellows desperately need
someone with these qualifi-
cations. (Arrangements are

De-Escalation

being made. by the way. for
the hiring of such a person
as soon as possible.)

Secondly, the program is
not being' evaluated in any
objective way. Sure, the Fel-
lows sometimes sit down and
talk about how they feel
about the program, but un-
fortunately, no one seems
concerned about long-range
evaluation. Perhaps the Rich-
ardson Foundation is wasting
$20,000 each year. Or perhaps
the Fellows are being harm-
ed by participating in the
program (e.g.. by becoming
arrogant or overly idealistic).
Who can ‘Say? But at least
someone must try to determ-
ine the long-range results of
the program, since it is only
by its results that the pro-
gram can be justified.

Besides these basic criti-
cisms, I have several other
misgivings about the pro-
gram. (All of these weak-
nesses, I believe, are conse-
quences of the two basic
flaws.)

With no help from any old-
er person, the sophomore
Richardson Fellows are in-
terviewing the freshman ap-
plicants. But are they compe-
tent to make these value
judgments? I think not. At
any rate, I am certain that
these sophomores have no
right to intimidate their fel-
fow students. (I have heard

that one freshman was asked,
“Why haven't you contributed
anything to Davidson since
you've been here?’ and sev-
eral freshmen froze up and
were unable to speak when
asked to defend their posi-
tions.) Are these sophomores
playing God?

Furthermore, the goals of
the program seem unrealistic
~—in fact, no one really knows
what they are. “We're trying
to develop leadership poten-
tial,” they say. But what
does that mean?

All is not lost, however. Con-
trary to what THE DAVID-
SONIAN editor believes, the
program has not gone “down
the drain." A seminar at
Chapel Hill and a visit by
civil rights worker Anna
Hedgeman were highly stim.
ulating and provocative: also.
several Fellows have made
important contacts and have
secured excellent summer
jobs through the program.
But I wonder why it takes
$20,000 to set up a couple of
Seminars and to place a few
students in summer jobs.
Why must so much money be
spent on office redecoration.
on summer trips for the stu-
dent director, and on meals
for the Fellows? And besides,
might it not be true that
the really outstanding stu-
dent.can secure his own sum-
mer jobs? And are there not
a great many opportunities

Purpose Of Education Lies

In Not Regulating Conduct

Reprinted from ‘The Hawk’
St. Joseph’s University

Not that we're trying to
deceive anyone. But we may
be fooling ourselves. It's been
a long time since we took an
honest look, as an academic
community, at the ‘‘image’
we foster.

It is a natural and praise-
worthy sentiment to want
the students of this college
to be known as gentlemen in
dress and conduct. But that
is not our primary concern
as a college. That is the re-
sult of the education. not a
condition of effectiveness dur-
ing the educational exper-
jence.

This college lays claim to
the philosophy of liberalizing
the individual, of developing
the truly educated man. Its
image—its reputation—should
substantiate this claim.

Our aim, if we are to be
consistent, is to develop the

ability to make sound decis-
ions not just about studies,
but about one’s identity as
an individual. The college
environment should provide
opportunities for learning the
implications of extending
one’s personality in society.
for experiencing the challenge

.of integrating individual free-

dom with social responsibili-
ties.

There may be mistakes in
judgment and in action. But
there is no more appropriate
place for making mistakes—
for learning by experience—
than in an academic situa-
tion. In an atmosphere of
learning even personal mis-
takes can lead to greater
self-knowledge and greater
understanding of society.

Students are here to learn,
to develop, to discover. To
expect them to respond free-
ly from the beginning of their

education as if they had com-
pleted it is to say either that
they have nothing to learn or
that they cannot learn any-
thing. This institution, if it is
sure of its identity as a lit»
eral arts college, does not
have to fear the presence of
those who do not conform to
even minimum social stand-
ards of dress. In fact, their
presence will be witness to a
spirit of inquiry, a spirit of
exposure to divergent atti-
tudes that is essential to a
liberal education.

Adaptability to the needs
of the times—a need for more
dynamic involvement in a
less formal acamedic  en-
vironment—this is the real
petition of the student body.
On this small but highly sym-
bolic regulation hinges the
college's acceptance of the
challenge to make itself ef-
fective as an educational
community.

for intellectual stimulation.
which already exist at David-
son, and which the Fellows
could. but don’t, take ad
vantage of? (Or does the
program encourage the Fel
lows to isolate themselves
from the ordinary opportuni-
ties and channels of action?)

Big deal, you say? Who
cares if the Richardson
Foundation wastes $20,000
this year? We all should
care, because as Richardson

money is being poured into
“leadership'’ programs, pro
grams of known value (such
as the Richardson Scholar
ships) are being discontin
ued.

In short, I am not ready
to write the program off as
a failure. But I, like THE
DAVIDSONIAN, have heard
too much taJk and have seen
too little action.

Davidson College.

Rejection Is Valid

Dear Editor,

Although we agree with
Mr. Earnhardt ahd THE
DAVIDSONIAN that the set-
ting of fires in dormitories is
a serious offense often made
with little regard to possible
consequences, we disagree
with THE DAVIDSONIAN’S
statement that the rejection
of the recently proposed
amendment shows an irre-
sponsibility on the part of
the student body.

The problem of dormitory
fires is not one which can be
adequately solved by addi-
tional provisions in the Con
stitution. Rather, steps should

be taken to emphasize and
enforce present regulations .
concerning student conduct
and those activities which
may result in damage to our
defacement of school proper-

ty.

We believe that enforce-
ment of standing regulations
within the flexibility newly
attained by the Student Body
Regulations offers a greater
opportunity for the expres-
sion of student responsibility
than would legalistic graffiti.

Pass In Review

Every forward-looking, perceptive observer of the
Davidson scene quite naturally applauds the decision
of the faculty to abolish compulsory ROTC and to do
away with academic credit for the first two years of
the program.

The ROTC department has traditionally provided
malcontents like myself with something to make hock
of. The elimination of its compulsory nature thus has
destroyed a part of the Davidson heritage, has denied
us chronic scoffers a convenient target for our- derision.
I am not ready to feel particularly deprived now that
the program seems to be on the road to extinction, but
there remains that still, small voice within me which
whispers, “Oh, damn! What can I go after now?”

Several aspects of the faculty move still remain
incredible. That such action could be termed “contro-
versial” (as it was described by the “Charlotte Obser-
ver’’) is amazing. That the vote was as close as it turned
out to be is astounding. And that it took until 1967 to
get rid of the institution is downright ridiculous.

Criticizing the program has iong been, in the
words of the good old analogy, like beating a dead
horse. To do so here would be repetitive and uninter-
esting, though a lot of fun. However, I'll resist the
temptation.

A whole tradition of legends has grown up around
ROTC activities. Many of these tales find their setting
in times before I happened upon the Davidson campus.
For example, there’s the one about the band comman-
der who decided to work up, on the quiet, a unique
contribution to a federal inspection. The day of the
inspection arrived, all the units were in place. At the
appointed hour, the troops began to pass in review.
Up from the band company rose the strains of “The
Mickey Mouse Club March.” I understand that the band
company commander lost some rank as a result of the
incident.

Or there’s the time that some non-ROTC upper-
classmen decided to surprise the brigade at another
federal inspection. At the end of the drill, the cadets
marched toward the gate out of Richardson Field, only
to find them locked. Ever since that affair, so the story
goes, cadets with unloaded guns (excuse me, weapons)
have been stationed at each gate to prevent a repeat of
the fiasco.

There are some incidents that I can recall from
my own days in the ROTC program. Who could forget
the last drill of Joe Dial’s sophomore year, when he
arrived on the field decked out in full beard, eye
Shades, white socks, uncut hair, and peace buttons?
His company commander ordered him to leave, stipulat-
ing that for each minute he stayed he would receive
something like five demerits. Joe stayed, protesting
that he was paying full tuition at Davidson College and
was thereby entitled to stay and participate in drill as
long as he so desired. He eventually quit the premises,
returning a short while in normal civilian clothes. He
found a good seat up in the stands of Richardson Field,
and watched the rest of the day’s proceedings from
that vantage point.

On the other extreme, there is the life story of
Pinckney Whitson. The ultimate in ROTC jock-ism,
Pinckney was noted for the intense seriousness with
which he engaged in all sorts of ROTC activities, from
drill to ROTC field day. Probably the peak of his career
here at Davidsen occurred when he challenged the
Charlotte National Guard to a rifle dis-assembly and
assembly contest.

My personal experience with drill was actually
fairly pleasant. I tooted the baritone horn in the band
company, and was able to sate some of my perverse
urges by playing out of tune, missing notes, and gen-
erally attempting to make the hour more interesting.
Good training for the GNP Rug Band.

In the ROTC classroom, however, my time was
less valuably misspent. My sophomore year, under the
tutelage of easy-going Major Fraley, wasn’t too bad, ‘
because he seemed to care about as little as 1 did. My
freshman year, though, was a different story. Led by
Major Gill, affectionately dubbed by the students “The
Desert Ox,” the course provoked a mixed response of
amusement and Pathos, pst and 269 other freshmen

ered through such challenging, provocative topics
as “The Care and Cleaning of fhe Rifle.” emer
