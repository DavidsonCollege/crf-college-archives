1000 people pass through the front doors, which
calculates to 8 million over the past 25 years. Dr.
Leland Park, Director of the Library, explains that
the building has served the college well. The de-

to accommodate changing
technology an important fac-
tor in the structure’s lasting
power. Currently, the library
has 470,000 volumes (im-

original 1630), half of which
have been checked out over
the past seven years. This sta-

What's in

According to Dr. Park aclass-
room in the basement and a
storage facility are in the
works. But the question on
everyone's mind: what about the green carpet? Dr.
Park points out that the green shade, which David-
son has come to hold near and dear to its heart, has
held up for 25 years, a impressive stint considering

nated funds for a
new building. On
October 1, 1941 the books were moved from the
Carnegie library to the Grey Memorial Library,
now the College Union, by a human chain of
students and faculty. The college served refresh-
ments and broadcast a ball game over loudspeaker
to keep the momentum going. By the late sixties

Davidson was outgrowing the Grey Library and *

made plans for the Little Library. An innovation in
architecture, the designers kept the Jeffersonian
design, but the new library could not exceed
Chambers’ daunting height. The library building
is modeled onthe only structure Thomas Jefferson
built
with a flat roof.

Today the library remains the center of aca-

and the storage
facility. When
asked about the current status of the building, Dr.
Park is confident that it will remain for another 25
years.
Whether used for checking e-mail, doing re-
search, or late-night
studying, the E.H. Little Library holds special
significance for almost
everyone at Davidson. For some it is a love/hate
relationship, but the E.H. Little Library remains
the center of most academic life at Davidson. Don’t
forget to go through Richardson Plaza Monday,
September 27 from 1-3pm. Get some free ice
cream and learn something about the place in
which you spend so much time.
