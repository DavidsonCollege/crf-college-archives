Composer Scott Robbins to debut piece at Davidson

By Josh Larned

Recognizing the need to sustain and

define America’s newly emerging

generation of composers, the Davidson
College Music Department established the
Wilmer Hayden Welsh Prize in Composi-
tion last year. According to visiting
professor of music Jennifer Stasack, “We
wanted to target a young energetic group
of applicants for this annual award.”

Indeed, the composition aptly fulfills
this goal as the applicants, who are limited
to ages 27-33, are requested to submit

unpublished and unawarded works for
piano and violin duo, 10 to 15 minutes in

duration.

prize’s namesake.

The end result has proven itself to be,
as Stasack enthusiastically describes, “a
harmonious outcome,” due to the fact that
the first recipient of the award is a former
North Carolinian with distinct ties to the

In addition, he has received a ASCAP
Foundation grant to Young Composers in
1992, and has won the CINE-Eagle

Non-Theatrical events for his soundtrack
to the 1991 film, The Clearing.

Most significantly, however, Robbins
has coincidentally studied under an former

On Monday afternoon, Scott was
present to discuss with students and

faculty three of his compositions. In

particular, Scott concentrated on his prize-
winning piece.

Scott will be present on Tuesday,
March 15 at the Davidson College Music
Department's faculty recital. He will
debut the piece for which he was awarded
the Wilmer Hayden Welsh Prize. ;

The recital take place in Hodson Hall
and will begin at 8:00 p.m. All students

are invited to attend.

Bob Dylan honored with tribute album

By Tom Bavis

When listening to Bob Dylan’s
songs, I often curse myself. I’ll
say, “I could have written that!” as
I hear simple lines like, “I wish
there was something you could do
or say / To make me change my
mind and stay / We never did that
much talking anyway...” But I
have to keep in mind that I didn’t,
and probably couldn’t. Bob Dylan
is nothing less than a genius at the
art of songwriting. He does the
difficult and makes it seem easy.

So it may seem strange that I
have no Dylan albums in my col-
lection. That is, quite simply, be-
cause I hate his voice. My knowl-
edge of his work comes through
the performances of the Byrds, Joan
Baez, U2, and others who have
covered his songs. Thus, the re-
cently released double CD Bob
Dylan—The 30th Anniversary
Concert Celebration seemed too
good to be true. Featuring a starry
line-up of Bob’s old friends and a
few young faces, this recording of
the Madison Square Garden show,
commemorating the 30th anniver-
sary of his first album, seductively
beckons, Almost 150 minutes long
with 29 songs by as many artists,
the album rarely disappoints.

One of the most inspired of
the Dylan interpretations is per-
formed by a singer who was un-
known just a year before the Octo-

Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Eric Clapton

ber 16, 1992 concert. Pearl Jam’s
Eddie Vedder, assisted by Mike
McCready on acoustic guitar, tears
through the anti-war diatribe “Mas-
ters of War.” Sending his voice on
the roller coaster ride that made
“Jeremy” and “Dissident” famous,
Vedder without a doubt improves
upon the original. Speaking di-
rectly to the nameless “masters of
war” with simply-worded venom,
Vedder whispers, “I hope that you

die and your death will come soon
/ 1 will follow your casket in the
pale afternoon.” Then he screams,
“ll watch as you’re lowered into
your deathbed / AndI’|l'stand over
your grave ‘till I’msure that you’re
dead!”

Ten seconds after Vedder and
McCready end abruptly on the
word “dead,” Tracy Chapman
launches into one of her favorite
covers, and one of Dylan’s most

famous songs, “The Times They
Are A-Changin’.” Unlike Vedder's
vocal gymnastics, Chapman de-
livers a straightforward, yet in-
spired performance.

Folk legend Richie Havens
belts out perhaps the finest perfor-
mance of them all. Havens’ voice,
unlike Neil Young, George
Harrison, and the other veterans,
has improved with age. With his
gravelly tenor and spirited acous-
tic guitar playing he fills up the
arena all by himself, especially as
he pleads, “And when we meet
again / Introduced as friends /
Please don’t let on that you knew
me when / I was hungry.”

The acoustic workouts by
Havens, Chapman, and others are
generally better than those done
with full rock arrangements. Stevie
Wonder spends so much time in-
troducing his cover of “Blowin’ in
the Wind,” I imagine the members
of the backup band losing their
will to live after two or three min-
utes. George Harrison’s voice
quivers like Jell-o over the lifeless
arrangement of “Absolutely Sweet
Marie.”

Rolling Stones guitarist Ron
Wood tries his best with “Seven
Days” yet unintentionally helps
explain why Mick Jagger is still
the Stones’ lead singer. Lou Reed
tries to belch “Foot of Pride” out as
loud as he can for eight minutes

straight, but loses rhythm, key, and
the crowd’s attention in the first 30
seconds.

One of the few people on the
star-studded roster who deserves
more praise as a songwriter than
Lou Reedis, appropriately enough,
the only man who sings worse than
Reed. That man is the guest of
honor and unanimous songwriter
of choice. Dylan appears at the tail
end of the concert, delivering spir-
ited but, even for Bob Dylan, vo-
cally embarrassing performances.
His voice wavers, gurgles and
honks throughout—sometimes all
at once—and renders his brilliant
lyrics unintelligible.

More palatable are the grandi-
ose finales of “My Back Pages”
and “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door,”
in which Dylan divides up the
verses with Neil Young, Eric
Clapton, Tom Petty, and other big
names from earlier in the concert.
With the kind of camaraderie tra-
ditionally associated with football
players and war veterans, the clos-
ing songs carry the irresistible,
though predictable, aura of old
buddies jamming together for old
time’s sake and not caring whether
they miss a note or two. They
almost make sense out of the ever-
enigmatic chorus to “My Back
Pages;” “I was so much older then
/ I’m younger than that now.”

themselves through movement.

As the group finished their final
steps, they shouted, “It’s in my

knees, I can’t sleep. It’s in my

my feet, I can't stop!

feet, I can’t stop!” Neither could
the audience—wild applause and
whistling accompanied the Bush
Women’s feverish dancing from
the middle of the work until it
ended. When the lights came up,
students were dancing on the

stage, dancing up the aisles, and
dancing all the way back to their
dorms.

Urban Bush Women was an
inspiration. The performance
demonstrated the slow reemer-
gence of dance at Davidson.
