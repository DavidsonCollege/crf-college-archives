10 THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1991

Expectations

Big buildings and small buildings. That’s
what we see at first. The cover of a book,
almost-meaningless and flat.

Time throws us together, slowly,
A dream sequence of motion and emotion,
Strangely grounded in reality.

Inside Art

We keep perspective, but hold on to ideal.

Our expectaions are like racehorses-
So much to do and Sée, we have no patience-
Only desire to do and see all.

It happens so fast.

Our feet brush the floors, the halls.

We linger over words and work, absorbing ideas
And learning as we’ve never wanted to.

We touch this place, a finger to a mountain-

We pass it by, and leave it as it was.

A meal becomes a party,
A chat an hour.

No time is ever wasted
When spent with a friend.

Nighttime is a hole in the day

Which we fall into and must crawl out of.
Thick with people, laughing and dancing,
Through beer-musty rooms,

Hot and sweating,

Degenerating and loving it.
And scattered fumbling rights
of open lipped relation

Born of bright eyes and music,
And one more drink.

Pages flip, fling faster and away.
These buildings are our home, as
familiar as our hands.

Natural, Comfortable, Personal.

As friends whose faces melt into our minds,

Present as personalities, and not as features to remember,
We read this place as a book, and live it,

and the cover becomes a footnote.

PARTHENIAD

I see you rise,

your still igneous form ~~
pulling up from steamy water
with the strength of a newborn god.
Sea-salt afterbirth

hee

oe

-waterfalls down your back _

You stand, erect,
your face to the wind, the wind
polishing your flesh,
cooling you to warm marble.
Finished, you wait. .
While I, sucking the dew
from your curls and the salt
from your pores,
emerge and
am born.
