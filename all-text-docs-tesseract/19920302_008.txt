THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, MARCH 2, 1992

Beyond Birkenstock:

The Birks Come to the Defense of Phillip Atchison

“The principle of free thought
means not free thought for those
who agree with us, but freedom for
the thought that we hate.”

-Oliver Wendell Holmes

When Braulio Lopez testified
before the honor council on Febru-
ary 14th, he stated that “I was pis-
sed off man, just the way he called
me nigger.” Indeed, the word is an
abhorrent and vicious one. Hu-
manity is singular in its tendency
to construct mechanisms to inflict
pain upon the individual. Nowhere
is this more evident that in the
subtle, yet positively debilitating
use of language to hurt another
person. Elaine Scarry, in The Body
In Pain, considers the subject of
torture and the torturer’s use of
language as a means of assault.
“The question, whatever its con-
tent, is an act of wounding; the
answer, whatever it’s content, is a
scream.” Noone, therefore, should
ever take words lightly. In it’s
more progressive aspects, the
communication of a literate mind
can inspire revolution or destroy
tyranny. In it’s baser existence,
however, the words of an articu-
late fool can destroy a reputation,
or engender chaos. In light of the
power and potential violence of
words, Is Oliver Wendell Holmes
correct in defending freedom of
thought (and it’s articulation: in
speech) to such an extent? We
believe that the answer is yes, and
we’ll attempt to show you why.

Let’s consider for a moment
exactly what took place that day
and its relation to the penalty. Ap-
parently two students, Daniel
Lamar and Braulio Lopez (among
others) engaged in a verbal ex-
change that resulted in some fight-
ing, the origin of which we were
unable to discover. However, later
that evening, Lamar recounted the
evening’s festivities to his drunken
roommate, Philip Atchison. It
seems Mr. Atchison telephoned
Mr. Lopez to tell Lopez how dis-
pleased he was with the night’s
events. Actually, Atchison called
and left a message on Lopez’s an-
swering machine stating, “F***ing
nigger, you got a lot of nerve, you
just watch your goddamn ass.”
Hmm. Upon receiving said mes-
sage, Mr. Lopez replied in kind to
Atchison’s roommate (whom he
apparently thought made the call).
Lopez stated in his testimony be-
fore the honor council that he
“wasn’t threatening . .. but was is-
suing a challenge to go one and
[sic] one with him to solve this
problem.” Hmm again.

- Based on this evidence (and
Atchison’s confession of guilt), the

honor council (a.k.a. The Star

Chamber) convicted Mr. Atchison
of violating Section IV of the

Alcohol

all policies we don’t like and then

watch them change accordingly.
Unfortunately, it’s not that easy.
For each of Dean Terry’s points
that we disagree with, we must
find an alternative solution that is

Revised Code of Responsibility:
Misconduct Which Affects the
Rights of Persons. Specifically, he
was found guilty of placing an
“obscene or harassing phone call.”

Problem number one: How
does Mr. Atchison’s call differ from
Mr. Lopez’s?

Problem number two: What
exactly is a harassing or obscene
phone call?

Problem number three: Why is
harassment by phone specifically
targeted?

Problem number four: What is
“hate speech” and
how does it relate to

nia, 1973). Atchison must then
have been convicted on the basis
of harassment. And what is har-
assment? According to Random
House, to “harass” is to “trouble by
repeated attacks, incursions, etc. .
. to disturb persistently, torment,
pester or persecute.” This defini-
tion implies duration of assaultand
would therefore tend toexclude an
individual action. Further, the
intent of the newly revised Section
IV isclearly an attempt to prohibit
sexual assault; it amazes us that
anyone could read this piece of
legislation and thereby determine

dent? It seems the honor council
felt compelled to rehabilitate his
sensitivity as well as his alcohol
consumption. For this reason
alone, his case ought to be recon-
sidered.

However, there is more at stake
here than simply Atchison’s case.
Indeed, the very fiber of our school
and our own Constitutional and
civil liberties hang in the balance.
The crux of the argument rests on
so-called “hate speech” and the
admissability of prohibiting any
speech, in light of the first amend-
ment. Consider Brandenburg v.

Ohio (1969). Colum-
nist Nat Hentoff char-

this question?
Problem number
five: Whatthe HELL
happened to the
Constitution?

Two concerns
immediately present
themselves. First of
all, Atchison’s re-
mark is seemingly of-
fensive- it offends us
and we trust itoffends
you. Secondly,
Atchison admitted
his guilt. The first is
relevant in so far as it

J. Kyle Kinner &
Seth J. McLaughlin

acterizes the case:
“even incitement of
violence is protected
unless that incite is to
‘imminent lawless
action’ (right then and
there). And unless
there are people listen-
ing who are able and
willing to commit that
lawless action (right
then and there).” Hen-

agree) that “this test
applies to that specific
form of imminently
dangerous language,

stimulates debate.
The second is regret-
table but irrelevant. As much as it
may pain you to admit it, Mr.
Atchison is innocent in spite of
himself, with the full force of the
Bill of Rights to protect him. Dis-
gusting, ain’t it?

Taking our concerns in order,
the difference between the mes-
sages left by Atchison and Lopez
seems, by Lopez’sown account, to
be a negligible one. Both were
aggressive: Atchison’s call was
admittedly motivated by anger
while Lopez’s call was a “chal-
lenge.” Each individual felt pro-
voked (perhaps in different ways),
and each sought to provoke the
other party with some form of ver-
balization. The messages were
delivered in anger and, we would

venture to guess, if they could ~

consider it in hindsight, none. of
this would have happened. It is
important therefore, to emphasize
the ambiguity of this situation and
place some of. the responsibility
with Lopez, while in no way ab-
solving Atchison. So, specifically,

we must look at why Atchison was

found guilty of violating the Code
of Responsibility.
Apparently the honor council

_ decided, based on the currentcode,

that Atchison’s call constituted ei-
ther a “harassing” or ‘“‘obscene”
action. Let’s consider that for a
moment. The text of the call
(specifically the racial epithet) is
clearly not obscene under current
court definition (Miller v. Califor-

more acceptable for the students.
As long as we send a message like

“This policy sucks,” the admini-

stration and trustees are going to
ignore our concerns. In fact, that
kind of message isn’t a concern.
The SGA encourages the stu-
dent body notto underestimate the
power of a collective voice from
the students. The faculty, admini-

that Philip Atchison’s stupid re-
marks were punishable ones. Fi-
nally, the code itself is inherently:
vague (what. “harassment”. or
“obscenity” is no one bothered to
define; and why is harassment by
mail or voice excluded?) and there-
fore moot. Indeed, the court has
not even attempted to define “har-
assment” or “intimidation” in spe-
cific terms essentially because such
a definition cannot be made with-
outinfringing on individual rights.
These are not minor objections; if
you accept our assertion that the
code is incredibly vague, and that
what Atchison did wasn’t even

covered under that code, then you

must also accept our conclusion
that Philip Atchison is innocent.
Why washe convicted? Surely
not because he admitted it; if we
admitted that we buy Frank Zappa
CD’s, there’s not much the Tipper
Gore’s on campus could do about
it because its not illegal. What we
think the honor council probably
convicted him under was some-
thing along the lines of “conduct
unbecoming a Davidsonian.” But
that’s not in the code either. Ulti-
mately, then, it stands to reason
that Atchison was convicted of in-
sensitivity in using the corrosive
word “nigger” to describe another
human being. Is it conceivable
that the honor council would re-
quire a student to take a course on
“Multi-culturalism” if that person
had merely threatened another stu-

stration, and trustees don’t know |}

near as much as we do about the

problems that exist concerning ||

alcohol at Davidson. . Let’s get
together on this.

not to general verbal
bigotry. And that test
is neither overly broad, nor vague
(as the code of responsibility is
both).”: In the words of Justice
Louis Brandeis, “The greatest dan-
ger to liberty lurks in the insidious
encroachments by men of zeal;
well-meaning but without under-
standing.”

Thus we see the honor council,
in its misunderstanding, attempt-
ing to combat racism by stifling
speech. Granted, what Philip
Atchison said barely even quali-
fies as speech, much less “debate;”
yet the conclusion to .narrowly
constrict someone’ right to speak
in order to preserve someone else’s
sensibilities is a false one. New
Yorkattorney Lisa Fleishman sug-
gests that “many whites--Irish,
Jews, and Armenians, for example-
-have claims to historical subjuga-
tion. And a lot of racism doesn’t
involve whites at all, but exists be-
tween members of: different mi-
nority groups. Do we have to
choose which group has been his-
torically more subjugated in order
to decide whose rights to enforce?”
Obviously, this is absurd. You can
also discern how the rule applied
to this very ambiguous case could
be extended to include, say, one
birk calling the other a conserva-
tive ass over the precious Davidson
College phone system or, ulti-
mately, to your ability to speak
your mind in any venue.

The objection that Davidson is
fundamentally able to legislate its

toffconcludes (and we ©

own value-system on campus is
morally illegitimate. Noone would
consider refusing to abide by the
civil rights laws, or the state crimi-
nal (or alcohol) code. Yet, are we
then to exempt ourselves from the
Constitution and the first ten
amendments (which also protect
our ability to tell you these things)?
The answer is learly no. This col-
lege is very probably a state-actor
in the constitutional sense. Or at
least, it soon will be, when the
resolution authored by Rep. Henry
Hyde (R-IIl) is passed. This reso-
lution would extend the right of
free speech even to the college
campus. Such ludicrous examples
as Dartmouth’s prohibition against
“vexatious oral exchange” would
be rendered invalid. Ultimately,
the necessity of a congressional
act to extend the protections of the
Constitution to Davidson College
is ridiculous. Président of Yale
University, Benno Schmidt sug-
gests that “universities cannot
censor or suppress speech, no
matter how obnoxious in content,
without violating their justifica-
tion for existence ... . It is to
elevate fear over the capacity fora
liberated and humane mind ..
[and will loose] an utterly open-
ended engine of censorship.”

We can only guess how many
other Davidsonians have. been
similarly disenfranchised by the
honor council, since, with rare
exception, that body operates: in
secret. Given only the single case
before us, we therefore suggest
that the offensive and harassing
code beremoved, and Mr. Atchison
be exonerated. Barring a school-
initiated review, we would there-
fore counsel Mr. Atchison to seck

_ legal advice and formally refuse to

accept this penalty, which is itself
unprecedented and completely
without base in the code. How
terrible a-task to defend remarks
suchas Atchison’s, but we believe
itfundamental to ourown freedom
of expression. While we acknowl-
edge the noble intentions of the
honor council, the effects of its
ruling are insidious and corrosive.
Only a short step remains to the
University of Connecticut’s em-
powering itself to censure “inap-
propriately directed laughter.”
With Lisa Fleishman, we af-
firm that “Believing that the elimi-
nation of racist speech Ns somehow
the same as eliminating racism is
plain romance . he concrete
measures of equality and power
have to do with money, food,”
education, housing. Hopefully, all x
those young minds inall those fine
universities [and colleges (that’s
you Davidson)} will- turn their
minds to the solution of real race
problems for real victims, and leave
hall monitoring to the First Amend-
ment romantics,” :
