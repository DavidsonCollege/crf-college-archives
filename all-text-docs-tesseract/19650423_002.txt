Concering Myopia

After the events of last week. the
thoughts and reactions that have filled
this week have seemed relatively piac-
id. Nevertheless, without exhausting
the points at hand, we feel it is nec-
essary to comment on the fraternity
situation as it stands today.

Next week the college trustees will
be faced with the decision of the fac-
ulty on the social life at Davidson. Ac-
tually the only measure that will re-
quire their attention and approval is
the recommendation calling for the
establishment of two new eating club
structures on Patterson Court.

We seriously doubt if the trustees
will be willing to take the $100,000
risk on the new structures.

Committing the college to such a
set-up, is definitely overlooking the
basic issues and problems involved in
the stagnant situation here now.

Whether purposely or not, the fac-
ulty has not touched upon the under-
lying cause of Davidson's unequal so-
cial situation, which arises from the
incredible exclusiveness of the frater-
nities on campus.

Yet no one seems to want to an-

swer to the glaring facts of rejection
and anti-intellectualism to which the
college is needlessly clinging under
the status quo.

We do not feel that the cure to all
ills can come overnight. But why in-
stitute a myopic measure that may
satisfy only a few self-seeking non-
fraternity men?

The trustees have received reports
of committees that have studied the
problem during the past four months.
No one denies that change must come.
We hope that the board members will
carefully consider the nine immedi-
ate recommendations of the Frater-
nity Evaluation Committee, two of
which are included in the faculty rec-
ommendations.

Without reservation we feel that
the nine measures, recommended by
11 of the 12 members of the evalua-
tion committee, propose the most
practical beginning toward a complete
social life for four out of every four
Davidson students.

Our hopes and fears are for the
years ahead, when patchwork will
have worn thin.

Religious Tolerance

The present Vespers system re-
quiring all students to attend Protes-
tant worship services is guilty at least
of gross discrimination against the
Christian Roman Catholics and the
‘non-Christian Jews at Davidson.

The purpose of the Vespers sys-
tem, as we see it, is too produce by
regular attendance at religious cere-
monies a deeper sense of spiritual
awareness and to instill a sense of
personal participation in one’s own
faith.

Yet this purpose and this privilege
is denied to all non-Protestants on
the Davidson campus.

These men who have no particular
religious ties with Protestant Christi-
anity are forced to attend and partici-

Probing The Klan

The House of Representatives in
Washington has voted $50,000 for an
investigation of the Ku Kiux Kian by
the House Committee on Un-Amer-
ican Activities. The move was In ac-
cord with President Johnson’s direc-
tive that legislation be developed to
“bring the activities of the Klan un-
der effective control of the law.”

Most Americans, including South-
erners, deplore klan violence. Very
few agree with the philosophy which
induces these men to resort to violent
tactics. Most would agree on the need
for a thorough inquiry by a respon-
sible authority.

Some have questioned whether the
Committee on Un-American Activities
is sufficiently responsible. The Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union maintains
that the Department of Justice is the
proper agency to look into possible
violations of criminal law. Others

pate in Protestant services as a re-
quirement of Davidson College.

But more important is this: requir-
ing non-Protestants to attend Protes-
tant worship services is morally inde-
fensible — it is religious intolerance
and coercion of the worst kind, an af-
front to the freedom of conscience—
and it is both morally wrong and an
act of intellectual bigotry to tell these
men “If you didn’t like our system,
you didn’t have to come here.”

We note with approval that the
Student Council is sponsoring a reso-
lution to the faculty committee on re-
ligious life designed to eliminate these
inequities.

We both endorse and actively sup-
port such efforts to remove any mark
of religious intolerance from the poli-
cies of Davidson College.

wanted a probe by the House Judi-
ciary Committee.

The Commission on Religion and
Race of the National Council of
Churches expressed concern because
it doubts whether the committee has
the will to undertake an effective in-
vestigation of the klan. Others sus-
pect that the committee is simply
seeking a way to justify an intensi-
fied probe of alleged Communist in-
fluence within the civil-rights move-
ment.

The administration, however, is
said to look with favor upon an inves-
tigation conducted by the Committee
on Un-American Activities both be-
cause its chairman is a Southerner
and because its reputation would pro-
tect it against charges of leftist influ-
ence.

In view of the fact that the com-
mittee will, in any event, investigate,
we hope it will prove its critics wrong
by bending over backward to carry
out a fair, competent, and exacting
investigation; because it is in the pub-
lic interest to have the true facts re-
garding the klan.

By The Way

Noteworthy on the Williams Col-
lege campus last week was the forma-
tion of the Student Committee for Re-
stricted Escalated Warfare (SCREW).

Talk about student apathy. SCREW
obviously was out to screw SDS, which
organized the recent picketing in
Washington to protest U.S. involve-
ment in South Vietnam.

Commended by The Williams Rec-
ord “for creativity and lack of pre-
tention in choosing a name,” the new
organization was calling for continued
U.S. action in the beleaguered nation.

The Record continued, “The polit-
ical dialogue at Williams has long
been onesided. Perhaps SCREW can
provide a breath of fresh air to con-
servatives and liberals alike.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Frist Blasts Demonstration Against Jones

Dear Editor.

Wednesday night a week ago,
several hundred members of the
student body demonstrated
against a member of the David-
son College administration bde-
cause of the stands he has taken
on the fraternity situation. One
of the stated demands of the
leaders of the demonstration
called for Mr. Jones’ resignation
from his position as. Fraternity
Liaison Officer.

While I am in complete accord
with the students’ right to ex-
press their feelings in such a
manner, (i.e., demonstration),
and in fact am grateful to see
some student interest expressed,
still I believe very strongly that
there has been a misplacement
of blame.

Mr. Jones has presented and
defended what he considered to
be the best solution to the pro-
blem of social life at Davidson

College. His proposals along
with many others, were taken
before the faculty April 13 for
presentation to that body. After
much discussion, the faculty
presented to Dr. Martin several
proposals it, as a majority, felt
to be in the best interests of the
entire student body. These pro-
posals were read by Dr. Martin
in chapel a week ago.

If we are, then, to ask for
the resignation of anyone be-
cause of the proposals presented
why not scalp every member
of the faculty who supported
these proposals?—Not only Mr.
Jones. In fact, most of Mr. Jones’
proposals were defeated “But,”
one says, “Mr. Jones’ job is to
represent fraternity and student
opinion.”

There was a_ referendum
which represented this quite ade-
quately, I feel. The faculty had
knowledge of this vote and of

other student suggestions when
they balloted. If the majority
of the faculty is so weak-willed
that it can be persuaded to vote
against its judgment, (as some
would have me to believe), on
a matter of such importance, by
a one-year man, then I think per-
haps the majority of the faculty
should resign and let us keep
Mr. Jones.

But the faculty voted for what
it considered to be the best in-
terests of the entire student
body, not because of Mr. Jones,
but because the faculty had seen
all sides of the issue presented
and thought that these proposals,
read by Dr. Matrin, were the
best solutions to the problem.

If we continue to ask for the
resignations of persons on the
faculty who have views contrary
to our own, we will only create
stagnation of thought. We tell
the trustees to get rid of the

Poole Urges Cooperation
With Faculty Frat Reforms

Dear Editor:

In reflecting over the campus
events of the past couple weeks
and months I have come. to
recognize a bit of irony. if not
paradox, in the thoughts and
actions of many Davidson stu-
dents.

The newsworthy matters
which affect people other than
the students themselves tend to
receive student criticisms. Many
of us will recall the degree of
sympathy with (and even a good
deal of student participation in)
the Civil Rights actions of last
year.

Recently we have seen. and
continue to see, student critic-
isms. of the North Carolina
Speaker Ban Law and our own
Davidson College Faculty Oath.
But each of these is touching
some element of society apart
from the Davidson student.

We hear the students cry out
for freedom of speech and ac-
ademic freedom on the campus.
We hear cries for a better facul-
ty unhampered by the walls of
white American Christianity.
But what happens when -the
faculty tries to remove the re-
straints which tend to hamper
the full development of the stu-
dents in turn.

Well I think we all know what
happens. During these last few
weeks we have seen the stu-
dents rebel against our faculty's
initiative (which the students
couldn't muster) to attempt
some changes toward a liberal-
ization of the student portion of
Davidson College.

If we as students have the gall
to speak out for freedom of
speech on other campuses and
for a more academically free
faculty here at Davidson, how
can we then think the faculty is
trying to ‘‘ruin’’ us by liberaliz-
ing the student side of the col-
lege?

I think we are being very
childish about this whole mat-
ter of social-academic change.
This may be partially under-
standable when a_ professor
takes it upon himself to recom-
mend that the students unite in
an effort to frustrate the facul-
ty action. But I think that bas-
ically we all need to re-examine

our own motives in this matter.
Are we concerned about the

fraternity question only in terms
of number one (me), or does
our concern extend outward to
enclose the entire college com-
munity. If it is the former, let's
cease our hypocrisy of speaking
out against the evils of every
system but our own. If the lat-
ter be the case, let's lend some
support to our able faculty and
try to effect some real improve-
ments,

Sincerely,

David E. Poole

Dear Editor:

The student response which
preceded Chaplain Will Terry's
exit from the stage in chapel
Thursday a week ago was, if
not desirable, at least significant
and appropriate to the occas-
jon.

Mr. Terry tried to interpret
the preceding night's riot-de-
monstration through the image
of Holy Week and the crucific-
tion. The hostility of the student
body to this interpretation forc-
ed him to omit the rest of his
talk, This reaction would cer-
tainly not have been hard to
predict.

A good while ago the chaplain
preached a sermon to the effect
that anyone who loves his neigh-
bor will be forced to suffer for
this love. Perhaps unintention-
ally, but most convincingly, the
chaplain’s point has been de-
monstrated.

Many of us doubt the relev-
ance of much of Christian doc-
trine to life as it is lived. But

not many would deny that, at
least on this occasion, Christ-
janity has faced the facts of life.
When we go to apologize to Will
for our conduct, he will pro-
bably be too “humble” to thank
us for proving him right.

Dear Editor:

The mantle of apathy that
the Davidson student body has
worn so long was cast off last
week, and we were reprimand-
ed for it.

The apathy we have shown is
due in part, I believe, to the
futility of objection. From the
first of this contretemps there
has been little we could do.
Some of us tried legislative,
legal means of expressing our-
selves, but most sat back to see
the virtual destruction of a ma-
jor part of Davidson's social
world. We sat back — partially
not knowing what to do, par-
tially not believing our opinions
would be considered.

We as individuals felt impot-
ent; we as a group (more cow-
ardly of us, I admit) finally
aired our views, and with enough
force to have them heard. We
were heard, but the answer was
disappointing.

Sign petitions, we were told:
we have. Write letters: and
some of us have. But don’t de-
monstrate, we were told: that
means will profit you nothing.
Our earlier means failed us;
so, apparently, have our last.

oath because it limits freedom
of thought, yet we make Mr.
Jones and other incoming facul-
ty members take our own little
oath: “I swear never to go
against the views of the major-
ity of the Davidson College stu-
dent body under threat of forced
resignation — Amen.”

So much js said about the

for the faculty, no drinking on
campus, etc. We cry, “Let's
catch up to the twentieth cen-
tury — change the oath and
drinking rules. — Follow the
examples of Harvard, Amherst,
Williams — Junk the childish
regulations!” We say this, but
anyone who advocates following
Harvard, Amherst, and Williams
fraternity-wise, we ask to resign.

We laughed at a certain Amer-

Dear Editor:

I'm tired of telling people 1
went to Davidson and then im-
mediately have them suspect
me of being a fact-crammed,
unthinking conformist, who will
prattle a liberal line, but doesn't
give a damn about anybody.

They believe this because in
the Davidson _ socio-religious
structure we had one of the
most sophisticated instruments
of unfreedom in this Brave New
World.

When 1 attended Davidson I
could discover the possibility of
freedom only by kicking the sy-
stem. Otherwise there was no
escaping conformity to the ‘‘gen-
tleman” image. The ‘‘gentle-
man’' at that time was a kid in
rebellion against a weird assort-
ment of mores he called Christ-
ianity.

I can't give you an answer,
because a college can change in
seven years, but I want to raise
a question—Can Davidson Col-
lege offer freedom within its
structure until compulsory wor-
ship services and the fraternity
system have been either aban-
doned or radically restruc-
tured?

Dear Editor:

For one mother of a David-
son senior, the most consist-
ently enjoyable feature of the
college has been THE DAVID-
SONILAN. The increasing con-
cern each year with ideas be-
ing disseminated in the broad-
er community by others of their
outstanding generation, and the
courage to state oft-time bru-
tally true and unpopular facts,
has filled me with admiration
dor members of the Staff.

That the pages of your paper
have been so much occupied
with anguished  self-examina-
tion by brothers in the frater-
nities is also an indication that
the social reform of the 60's
has penetrated the cloistered
campus of Davidson.

As a visitor on the campus
recently, I felt again the com-
forting “coming home” fecling
which always. awakens child-
hood memories of other well-
loved small Virginia towns. The
warm welcome by Mrs. Little
and the hospitality afforded by
the guest house added to our
pleasure.

We were offered two places
at the dinner table of the Kappa
Sig house and treated to a su-
perb dinner presided over by
their charming and capable
house mother, Mrs. Robinson.
(I regret that the box of fudge
carried down for her was con-
sumed by the senior to whom
it was entrusted.)

Conversation at dinner was
challenging, and the oft-repeat-
ed cry for better speakers at
Chapel was reiterated. One
could hardly ask for a more
distinguished speaker, however,
than Author and Editor Hod-

ican Legion speaker the other
week, because he wanted to ban
speakers with alien views from
ours, from college platforms.
We said to give the Communist
his freedom to express his views
— we aren't kids anymore.
But Wednesday night, the ma-
ture student who laughed so
hard and hooted so loud that
chapel, was out asking for the
resignation of Mr. Jones, be-
cause Mr. Jones had used his
freedom, and we didn’t like
what he said.

I guess I could have summed
up all I wanted to say without
so many words — I just think
there is a better way. If you
don’t like his ideas — speak
against them, but don't speak
against his right to present
them by asking for his resigna-
tion. Mr, Jones only had one
vote.

ding Carter who spoke on Fri-
day, April 7. His newest
book is about the experiences
of Albert and Malva Heffner,
parents of “Miss Mississippi,’
who were forced to leave Mis-
sissippi because they spent an
evening of discussion with sev-
eral white ministers who were
active in instituting social re-
forms.

I was surprised to learn that
the Davidson Male Choral group
does not sing at chapel. Hav.
ing heard them this week at
the Christ Congregation Church
in Silver Spring. Mlaryland, I
believe that their beautifully
trained voices would be a great
incentive for students to at-
tend.

After dinner we saw an. in-
-spired Davidson basketball
team romp joyously to victory
over North Carolina’s finest.
Scotty Nicholls, Joyce Driesell
and I formed a delighted. and
dedicated cheering section en-
gulfed by the shrieking and
gasping eight thousand about
us. For once in my life I did
not have to point out to the ref-
erees their lack of vision and
judgment.

The next morning permitted
a leisurely survey of the cam-
pus library and I later learn-
ed that the Genior Class is con-
sidering donating money for
books as their parting gift. As
this is the only means by which
a request can be made as to
how money may be spent, par-.
ents of seniors who wish to
donate books might add to the
fund. ;

Such a gift could publicize
the inadequacy of the number
of volumes in the library of a
college of such an outstanding
academic reputation as David-
son. Vassar College, having
the same highly selective pol-
icy for student applicants, has
three and one-half times the
number of volumes in the li-
brary.

fin the quiet of the guest
house again I found a proverb
which pleased me in that I
believed it applies to the goals
the staff of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN is setting for its readers.

“He that getvteth wisdom lov-

eth his own soul: he that
keepeth understanding shall
find good."’

Dear Editor:

Wednesday night last week.
the Hundred Davidson Seniors
rose bravely to the cause and
pledged their staunch support
to the proposed boycott. Thurs-
day morning, the Hundred stood
as one in public proclamation
of their indissoluable Vow as I
shielded my face from the glare
of flashing pins.

Only this week, I noticed a
hundred embarrassed. Davidson
Seniors sheepishly slipping into
their assigned seats as the last
chapel bell drew near.
