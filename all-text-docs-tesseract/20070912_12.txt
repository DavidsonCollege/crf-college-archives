Water conservation Flag forces

efforts affect College

By JORDAN WALL

Staff Writer .

North Carolina found itself in
the throes of a major drought this
summer, enduring a heat wave that
lasted throughout most of August.
Temperatures reached as high as
104 degrees.

Irwin Brawley, College Director
of Property Management and
Grounds, said without reservation
that this is “one of the worst
droughts [he’s] ever seen.”

The high heat and lack of rainfall
has resulted in mandatory water
restrictions on all] residential prop-
erty in Charlotte-Mecklenburg
County.

Watering a lawn more than two
days a week, refilling pools, ponds
or fountains and car washing is
currently prohibited.

Although the campus, as a com-
mercial customer of Charlotte-
Mecklenburg County utilities, is
not obligated to abide by the new
water restrictions, Brawley said
that the Physical Plant staff is defi-
nitely “thinking green.”

The College is following the
water restriction guidelines by only
watering its lawns twice a week,
with a few exceptions for athletic
fields.

The field hockey field, for exam-
ple, requires watering to slow
down the ball in play, but the field
is currently watered before official
games only and not before prac-
tice.

Additionally, one of the largest
consumers of water on campus, the
motorcade car wash at the Physical
Plant on Ridge Rd., has been shut
down to reduce waste.

The motorcade car wash is used
to clean golf carts and other cam-
pus vehicles.

Because of the drought, the
Physical Plant staff has struggled
to maintain newly planted flora on
campus.

In order to reduce water waste,
will limit the use of the campus
sprinkler systems on the many
lawns and flower beds around cam-
pus, instead resorting to hand-

Political organizations gear up for ’08

It is Presidential campaign sea-
son—the most wonderful time of
the four year election cycle for the
nation’s political gurus.

With the presidential primaries
looming and the national election
just over a year away, political
organizations around campus have
already begun planning to engage

both students and the surrounding
community in the political debate.

In the coming months, groups
such as Young Republicans,
College Democrats and the
Davidson Chapter of Students for
Barack Obama plan to spearhead
projects that will include fundrais-
ing, canvassing the local area and
recruiting voters.

Their ultimate hope is not only to
support their chosen candidate, but

to raise political awareness and
involvement on campus and the
local area.

The Davidson Chapter of
Students for Barack Obama,
founded last spring, has expanded
its membership to over 60 ardent
supporters of the young candidate
in just a few months.

The group anticipates a busy
season.

“Many members of the organiza-
tion will be volunteering for the
South Carolina Neighbor to
Neighbor Canvass,” Andrew
Gorang ’08, Interim Director of the
Davidson Chapter, said. “We are in
close communication with the
South Carolina campaign office
and hope to give them support

throughout the coming months.”

Last spring, the group participat-
ed in a webcast with Obama, an
opportunity Gorang anticipates
will reoccur as the primaries draw
near.

While the Davidson Chapter of
Students for Barack Obama focus-
es its efforts on a particular candi-
date, neither the Young Democrats
nor the College Republicans are
endorsing any one contender,
choosing to wait until after each
party has made its respective nom-
ination.

In the meantime, however, nei-
ther group intends to remain idle
until the primaries conclude, and

discussion

President Tom Ross’s remark '
iconcerning the presence of a
Confederate flag in an unspeci-
fied Davidson College building
created a strong emotional
responses among many students
and set the rumor mill running
after last Tuesday’s Convocation.

Soon after the speech, there
were accounts of students march-
jing the flag through Patterson
\Court, charges of racial insensi-
tivity and also discussion con-
cerning the appropriateness of the
various North-South competi-
|tions that happen each year
‘swirling around campus.

According to Sigma Alpha
Epsilon’s (SAE) President
Andrew Johnson ’08, the fraterni-
ty’s house has long featured the
Confederate flag that prompted
Ross’s remarks.

Usually, the flag hangs next to
an American flag in the fraterni-
|ty’s basement, but the brothers '
had temporarily transferred it to |
the building’s main room, where
Ross saw it.

After Ross’s remark, several
brothers removed the flag, and
Johnson discussed the flag’s vari-
ous connotations, both positive
and negative, with Dean of
Students and Vice President for
Student Life Tom Shandley.

Johnson also met with Student
Government (SGA) President
Chris Burton ’08 to discuss how
to open up the issue for student
discussion. |

Johnson also said that, if a
jmarch of any type took place, he
was unaware of it and that it was
not an SAE activity.

Several members of both the
College’s African-American and
white populations have objected
to the flag as a racist symbol that
