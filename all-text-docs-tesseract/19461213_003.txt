Red Bethea handled most of the punting department
kicking 38 times for an average of 33.4 yds. per boot.
Looking at the tally, Bethea’s kicking was not up to the
standards he set in ’42 when it was Red’s boots that
consistently sailed over the heads of perplexed tail backs,

zooming for seventies and seventy-fives.

Jimmy Sif-

ford did some punting of his own, kicking 9 times for

a 39.5 yd. average.

On pass defense it was Erwin, Pahl, Richards
and Mapes who showed most favorably. Erwin
intercepted 4 passes making | returns totaling 57
yds. while Richards and Mapes batted many an

Cats Take
Furman 13-7

Davidson’s determined Wildcats
ended their 1946 season on a note
of triumph when they scored a con-
vincing 13-7 victory over Furman
University in a Turkey Day clash
at Greenville. Twelve thousand
fans sat in on the festivities at
Sirrine Stadium and watched Coach
Story’s inspired charges spoil the
South Carolinians’ Homecoming
celebration with a well earned de-
cision.

Cats Alert

In notching their initial win of
the season against Conference oppo-
sition, the Cats played alert ball,
capitalizing on an intercepted aerial
to rack up their first tally, and
staging a sustained drive of
yards to annex their second score.
Sifford sliced over Furman’s right
tackle for the opening touchdown
in the first quarter, and Pahl
smashed over his right guard for
the concluding marker in the third
frame.

The visiting Wildcats completely
dominated play with the exception
of the waning minutes of the final
quarter. Late in the quarter Tru-
luck faded and dropped a beautiful
40 yard pass into the outstretched
hands of “Skeeter” Coyle, diminu-
tive Hurricane speedster and the
swift back raced 34 yards into the
end zone to complete the most spec-
tacular play of the afternoon,

Following the kickoff, Furman
recovered Anderton’s bobble on the
Cats’ 40 yard stripe to threaten the
Presbyterians’ precarious 13-7 mar-
gin. However, the Wildcat line
held and Truluck’s punt bounded
into-the end zone. Bethea’s ensu-
ing kick was returned by Coyle to
his own 35 .as time began to run
out. Truluck engineered a des-
perate Hurricane drive to the Da-
vidson 380, but Anderton batted down
Truluck’s pass in the end zone to
insure a Wildcat victory.

“Y’’ Sponors
Midget Ball

A packed (portion of) Richard-
son field witnessed one of its most
thrilling contests Wednesday, De-
cember 4, as a surprising Barium
Springs -midget eleven pulled one
of the major upsets of this torrid
’46 campaign in slipping past the
Davidson-Cornelius All Stars 6-0.

Sporting a hard charging line,
the Barium boys rolled from their
own 40 yard line after taking an
All Star kick in the third quarter.
It was the swivel hipped Barium
tailback who wormed his way off
tackle for the remaining three
yards and the lone~tally of the
contest.

The All Stars sported a well
coached team that equalled Barium
in all departments except on the
scoreboard.

The Y, in its program for the
grammar school boys, has organ-
ized teams in Huntersville, Cor-
nelius, and Davidson. Much credit
is due to Bill and “Dusty” Smith
working at Huntersville; Bob Wilk-
ins and Perry Hudnell at Cornelius;
and Steve Wilkinson and Harry
Temple here at Davidson.’ These
boys have spent three or more aft-
ernoons each week at these three
communities teaching the midgets
fair play, teamwerk, and sports-
manship in coaching football.

These three teams have played
16 games this fall including games
in Charlotte and Barium Springs,
and deep appreciation has been ex-
pressed by the principals of the
grammar schools to Haywood
Brinegar who is in charge of the
Gra-Y program.

Mat-Team Preps
For Hot Season

Down on the mats the aspirants
to the art of the grunt and groan
are hard at work. The turnout for
the Wrestling team: amounted to
some 51 men as workouts got un-
der way last week. Along the line
of experience the prospects are only
fair, with just two letter, men back,
Stroup and O’Hare. Stroup was
previously in the 121 weight class
but will probably wrestle in the 128
group this year. Dick O’Hare takes
the mat. at 175. Both are experi-
enced men and will probably be
mainstays of the team for the sea-
son.

Among the newcomers are two
flashy proSpects who will no doubt
see much action this year. W.
B. MeCall hailing from Barium
Springs, is a classy mat-man and
was State Champion before coming
to Davidson. W. D. Montgomery
though as yet untried, has all the
appearances of a first rater, plus
experience of no little mean col-
lected in his prep school days.

The weight divisions are arranged
in classes running: 121, 128, 138,
145,165, 175, and unlimited, giv-
ing the smallest to the heaviest
man on the team a chance to show
his stuff. And with the schedule
thus far arranged the mat-men will
have plenty of opportunity to do
just that. Opening January 11, the
schedule runs as follows:

January 11—VMI (away)

January 15—Duke (home)

January 25—North Carolina
(home)

January 31—Ga. Tech (tentative)
| home
February 8—Appalachian (home)
February 183—Ga. Tech (away)
February 15—Auburn (away)
February 22—W. & L. (home)
March 1—N. C, State (Raleigh)

SPORTS MIRROR

Browsing through Davidson's
sports history in the editions of
yesteryears we found an. item
which was an event of the mo-
ment in the past. The headline
read something like this: VMI
Beats Cats 2-0, as Rain-soaked
Field Halts Both Offenses—

“A blocked punt which rolled
over the goal line and out of
the end zone for a automatic
safety early in the first period
gave VMI a 2-0 victory over the
Davidson Wildcats last Satur-
day at Bluefield, West Virginia.

“Harold Tipton, Keydets tackle
broke through.the line in the
early minutes of the game to
block one of Sharpe’s punts
which led to the only score of
the game.”
