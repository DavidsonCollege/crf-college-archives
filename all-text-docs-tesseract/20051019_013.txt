Hoak scores another game-winner vs. UNC-A

By BRENT McCormick

Following a hard-fought loss to No. 8
ranked Wake Forest and a rained-out contest
against No. 24 UNC-Greensboro in which
Davidson trailed 3-1, the Wildcats needed
some big plays and a solid team effort to get
back to their winning ways.

As most of the campus fled Davidson for
the fall break weekend, the "Cats squad used
a much-needed streak of home games to
bring themselves to a three-game winning
streak, increasing their home record to 6-1
this season.

In the first game of the series, the ’Cats
netted two important second-half goals to
knock off Coastal Carolina 3-1 on Oct. 9.

Davidson scored the first goal of the game,
as Cass Baltz ’07 put in his third of the sea-
son off a pass from co-captain John Latting
06.

Jeff Davis ’06 played a ball to an open

the first point of the game.

Tied 1-1 heading into the second half, a
Chanticleer was issued a red card for taking
down Davidson goalkeeper Ben Ashton ’08
during a corner kick.

The offender was ejected, and Coastal
Carolina played with a man down for the rest
of the match.

Davidson capitalized on the advantage,
netting two goals, with the first coming from
Aaron West ’08. It became the game-winner,
West’s first this season.

With more than 15 minutes to play, a shot
from Marco Antunez ’07 deflected off
Chanticleer’s goalkeeper to West. He put the
ball home and gave Davidson the lead and

right post. It was his first goal of the season.

Later in the week, Davidson scored a pair
of first half goals and defeated the UNC-
Ashville Bulldogs 2-1 Wednesday night at

Alumni Stadium. The win was Davidson’s
second straight.

In the 34th minute of play, the ’Cats’
Robby Hoak ’08 found the ball off a free
kick from co-captain David Sartorio 06 and
scored in his team-leading seventh goal of
the season to give Davidson an early 1-0
advantage.

Soon after, Baltz scored again, finding the
back of the net from about 25 yards out, his
fourth goal of the season.

The ’Cats held Asheville shotless in the
first half, with a 13-0 shot advantage. UNC-
Asheville’s only goal came in the 87th
minute when a Bulldog fired a shot past
Ashton.

Davidson entered Sunday’s home game
against the College of Charleston squad hop-
ing to extend their winning streak to three
games.

Jon Bassett ’08 netted his first goal in a
Wildcat uniform, and Hoak put in the game
winner as Davidson pulled out an impressive
comeback victory to keep their winning
streak alive.

Sartorio scored first for the "Cats off of a
penalty kick in the 25th minute of the first
half, effectively tying the game.

Behind 2-1 late in the game, Bassett found
a loose ball and netted a goal from about 25
yards out to tie the game 2-2.

In the last minute, Hoak went one-on-one
with a defender and took a shot from about
15 yards into the lower right corner of the
Charleston net. Wilkie was credited with the
assist.

After three impressive home wins,
Davidson will return to Alumni Stadium to
play SoCon foe Furman on Wednesday at 7
p.m.
