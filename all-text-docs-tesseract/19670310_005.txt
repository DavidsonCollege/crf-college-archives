The Point After

DON’T WORRY

AFTER the conclusion of the Southern Conference
family reunion, stirrings among the Charlotte press hinted
that the Queen City might lose the SC tourney to Rich-
mond next year because that city’s coliseum would be
completed and because of the Atlantic Coast Tournament
the weekend following next year’s tournament in Char-
otte.

Well, don’t worry about it. A spokesman for the SC
Commissioner’s office in Richmond said that the Rich-
mond arena will not be completed for another five years.
Does Charlotte win by default? Greensboro is also in the
picture, but is not a likely host because of shadow of the

THEREFORE Charlotte will become the basketball
mecea of the South with both conference tournaments
just four days apart. But the question is: Can Charlotte
support the North-South Doubleheader, the Southern
Conference Tournament and the ACC fiasco on succes-
sive weekends?

_ Attendance at the Saturday night finale was disap-
pointing but the blame must partially fall to the moguls
who signed the television contract with no if’s. In past
years Charlotte was blacked out unless a sellout was pro-
bable, but this year the plans were definite before tickets
sales were even begun.

CHARLOTTE has shown in years past that it buys
basketball tickets like they came with savings stamps and
next year should be a revival of the good old days if Da-
vidson regains that form that used to sell out the Big

Dome.

DESPITE this column’s feeling that we might be
wearing out our welcome in Charlotte with too many
regular season games plus two tournaments, next year
should be the year. Charlotte has had an extraordinary
interest in the progress of the freshman team and this
excitement should carry over. Let’s hope that the fresh-
men do too.

If the other schools in the Southern had arenas that
were respectable places to play big-time basketball, play-
ing in the Coliseum might not be so frequent, but until
that happens, Davidson's schedule will show more and
more games in Charlotte as compromises from playing in
such dens of iniquity as VMI, The Citadel, GW’s armory
somewhere in Washington, and William and Mary.

Taus Edge Sigs
To Claim Crown

By BOB STUBBS
Sports Writer

The ATO’s, playing almost
perfect ball for three quarters,
held on in the fourth to beat the
Kappa Sigs. 59-48, in an unoffi-
cial IMAC championship game.

Flashy Cecil Clifton sparked
on offense and defense for the
victorious Taus, who had lost to
the Sigs by 13 points at the be-
ginning of the season. Both
houses finished with 11-1 records.

The Sigs jumped off to an
early 6-1 lead, but the Taus be-
hind Geoff Birkhead fought
back and, when he sank a crip
shot with five seconds left in the
first quarter, led 11-10.

With the score tied 18-18 Clif-
ton began to take charge. He hit
two layups after stealing the ball
at midcourt to give the surging
Taus an eight-point lead with
1:00 left in the half.

Clifton made what can only be
described as one of the most
fantastic shots of this or any
season. With 0:02 left he made a
two-handed 50 foot set shot to
send the Taus out at halftime
with a 30-22 lead.

In the second half the Taus
took advantage of the cold-shoot-
ing Sigs to build a 14 point lead.

their biggest lead of the night.

Tucker Laxton and ‘“‘Cherub"’
Garrison came off the bench to
ignite the Sigs’ attack and turn
a runaway back into a close
game. With Garrison scoring
eight and Laxton four they out-
scored the Taus 13-4 and trailed
by just three points, 46-43.

But Clifton and Birkhead set-
tled the faltering Taus down.

BEST SC FINISH

Matmen Win Third

Finishing their finest season in 34 years, Davidson’s wrestling team captured R 4

third place in the Southern Conference Championship Tournament last weekend at
Morgantown, W. Va., finishing behind West Virginia and The Citadel.

Taking only seven men to the
tournament, Coach Charlie Par-
ker’s matmen, who had compil-
ed a 6-2 regular season record,
won two weight classes, were
second in three divisions and
finished third in the other two
categories entered.

Davidson had won only two
classes over the last 38 years,
but Colin Hudson became the
first Davidson champ since Har-
old Westerfelt in 1959 when he

efeated Mike Benson of West
Virginia in the 115-pound class.
Sophomore Hudson, who had lost
only once in the 123-pound class
during the season, dropped to
115 to win what Parker termed
the toughest division of the tour-
ney since four other teams en-
tered good wrestlers.

Hudson won his matches, 1-0,
3-0 and ‘4-2. Parker said that
Hudson wrestled “‘a perfect
match, staying in control to
thoroughly beat his opponent
even though the score remained
low.”

In the final match of the tour-
nament. Lowell ‘Walrus’ Bry-

an defeated Bob ‘‘Whale"’ Boyd
of The Citadel, 12-5, gaining re-
venge a 3-2 defeat two weeks.ago
at Davidson. It was the most
points ever scored on Boyd.
Parker said.

To get to the finals, Bryan de-
feated a West Virginia football
player who had sweated to 245
pounds from 285, 13-3.

Captain Joe Buffington, Dean
Cromartie and Kerry Keith all
lost matches in the finals to earn
second places.

Buffington. the senior whom
Parker is reported once to have
told that he would never make
a college wrestler, battled the
West Virginia 130-pounder to a
3-3 regulation tie, only to lose in
overtime. A questionable calli by
a referee sent the match into
overtime.

Cromartie wrestled his way
into the finals only to lose, 3-1,
when he was taken down in the
last period.

Keith defeated West Virginia's
167-pounder on 62 seconds of rid-
ing time in the semifinals... Keith
said he counted the last 10-15

seconds before ‘‘allowing’’ the
Mountaineer an escape in the

last period. In the finals, Keith |f

lost one of the top matches of
the tournament to The Citadel's
Mike Armstrong. the reigning
167-pound champ.

Finishing in third place for the
Wildcats was Julian Prosser
with a decisive win over the
VMI entry in the consolation
finals. In the semis, he lost to
the. West Virginia captain, who
captured second place.

Terry O'Hair also finished in
third place. smothering the West
Virginia's 160-pounder in the
consolation match.

Parker noted that Bryan had
a good chance to win the Most
Outstanding Wrestler Award of
the tournament but the ballots
were collected before the end of
the final match, preventing vot-
ers from giving him proper con-
sideration.

The matmen will cap the sea-
son with a trip to Kent State in
Ohio for the national tournament
March 23-25.

Warner Alford Joins Grid
Staff As Defensive Mentor

By DON SEWELL
Sports Writer

Davidson's football coaching staff has added a. first rate assistant by hiring
Warner Alford, a defensive specialist whose background as a player and a coach at
the University of Mississippi recommends him highly. Alford will fill the vacancy
left by Dick Tomey who accepted a coaching job at Kansas.

“Coach Alford’s duties will be
handling our seven defensive
linemen in all phases of their
preparation,'' said head coach
Homer Smith. Alford comes to
Davidson from an assistant high
school coach's job in Laurel,
Miss.

Previously, he had a fine ca-
reer as a player at Ole Miss.
Alford played during the 1958,
1959 and 1960 seasons, going both
ways for the Rebels. He played

teams with 17 points. Jennings

most caught us in that surge in

er on defense.

During his three-year career,
Ole Miss lost only three games.
Among their victories were two
Sugar Bowl wins and one Gator
Bowl victory, In 1960 Alford and
his teammates earned the Grant-
land Rice trophy for the nation-
al champions. The previous year
they had been named the South-
eastern Conference Team of the
Decade.

Alford was graduated with an
A.B. degree in business admin-
istration. Afterward, he coach-
ed high school ball for several
years. In 1965 he returned to Ole
Miss to earn a M.A. in econom-
ics. During his time there as a
graduate assistant he served as
defensive coach. From there he
went to Laurel ‘last year.

“I am impressed by the type
of athlete here. He is a serious,
studious man. I feel that David-
son has a great deal to offer

* such a person both from its aca-

program,"’ commented Alford.
He was also very pleased with
Davidson's athletic facilities.
Alford explained that pride is
a very important factor in his
theory of defense. He added that
with this pride, any player can
hustle and be ready to play well.
Smith commented, “He is
more than the right man for the
job. He. represents something

Eager To Get Started

BATMEN OPEN WEDNESDAY

16 Face Baseball Season

By CLIFF DUKE
Sports Writer

A new baseball season be-
gins next Wednesday when
Coach Tom Stevens and a
numerically thin 16 - man
squad take the field at Mi-
senheimer for the first of
two exhibition games with
Pfeiffer College. Both
squads return to tangle in
Davidson’s brand new ball-
park next Saturday.

Although handicapped by a
severe lack of depth, a strong
nucleus of talent and leadership
is available as the squad pre-
pares to launch a 29-game cam-
paign. The shortage of players
is most painfully evident in the
pitching corps.

“We just don’t have enough
pitchers. With all our double-
headers, I'd like to have six
men. But we don’t give scholer-
ships, and great pitchers don't
just happen onto college cam-
puses,”’ Stevens bemoaned.

The mound staff lists seniors
Gene Bennett, Buddy Durham
and Charlie Elliot, sophomore
Mackey Reavis. and transfer
student Danny Stafford. In addi-
tion, Stevens hopes to call on the
services of Bob Pickens, an out-
standing junior college hurler.

Pickens would be the only left-
hander available.

Stevens is counting on hitting
and defense to bolster the pitch-
ing deficiency, although experi-
ments will continue through sev-
eral games to determine the
best starting line-up. At present,
the infield appears fairly set,
the only question marks being at
second and third base.

With big Hank Strickland be-
hind the plate “our catching
should be the best ever. He has
the arm, and a lot of experience
in Legion and semi-pro base-
bail,” Stevens remarked.

At first base, Ray Logan has
size and range, and is counted
on to contribute a big bat to the
Wildcats’ scoring punch. Stevens
commented, “Logan seems to
really like baseball, and that's
what I want.”

Davidson's double-play duo
will be sophomore Stew Brown,
who has all the tools to be “‘the
best shortstop I've had in -the
ten years I've been here,” and
Skip Waite, who as. team cap-
tain will supply “leadership I
can depend on. He réally hus-
tles,"’ according to Stevens.

Dick Lindsey, a dependable
regular, will probably hold down
the keystone corner. However,

to add depth to the infield David
King and Frank Murphy are
practicing there.

In the outfield Claude Owen is
a transplanted first baseman
whose enthusiasm, hard work,
and strong hitting make him a
team leader. Currently scrapping
for the other berths are King,
Murphy, Jack Smith and Sandy
Brenneman. “If King and Mur-
phy, with their strong arms and
speed, can hit well enough” to
start, they'll give us the fastest
outfield I've had here,"’ stated
Stevens.

Success this season will de-
pend on a combination of factors
cited by Stevens — enthusiasm,
determination, the ability of the

team to make full use of its abil-
ities and how well the thin pitch-
ing corps holds up.

Concerning conference play,
Stevens made the natural pre-
diction—West Virginia and East
Carolina should scrap for the top
slot. Richmond and VMI are al-
so listed as contenders.

This will be the first season
for the Wildcats in their brand
new ballpark. The field will be
in excellent shape, with pro-like
dugouts and a new scoreboard
to indicate balls and strikes.
Stevens believes that ‘In time
we'll add dressing room facili-
ties, and then we'll have one of
the best parks on a college cam-
pus.”

’Cats Place Sixth
At Indoor Meet

Five Davidson tracksters par-
ticipated in the Southern Confer-
ence, Indoor Track meet as
Coach Heath Whittle’s charges
finished sixth in a field of eight
teams, last Saturday at Lexing-
ton, Va.

Individual honors were won
by Greg Cox who won a medal
for fourth-place in the broad
jump, and Randy Randolph who
finished in fourth place in the
shot put. .

Other cindermen participating.
were Barry St. Clair in the 880-
yard run, Charles Cameron in
the 60-yard dash and Roane
Cross in the shot put.

As expected, a strong William
and Mary team finished first.
VMI won second place. and
Richmond took third.

“We were up against pretty
strong competition. Most of the
other teams had already been
in four or five indoor meets.
This was our first one,’’ Whittle
said. ‘One disadvantage we
have is no indoor place to work
out,” he added. .

The ‘Cats first home meet is
a triangle meet with Wofford
College and High Point College
tomorrow. High Point College
won third place in the Davidson
Relays last year:

“I think that we can win. We
will be awfully disappointed if
we don'‘t,”’ Whittle concluded.

The field events will begin at
1:30 p.m.

WHO’S GOT THE BUTTON?

I’m sure it has not escaped your notice that underlying
the adorable whimsy which has made this column such a
popular favorite among my wife and my little. dog Spot,
there ia a serious attempt to stay abreast of the problems
that beset the American college student.

Many a trip have I made to many a campus-—talking to
undergraduates, listening to their troubles, hearing their
grievances, reading their buttons. (Incidentally, the sec-
ond and third most popular buttons I saw on my last trip .
were: “WALLACE BEERY LIVES” and “FLUORI-
DATE MUSCATEL.” The first most popular button was,
as we all know, “SCRAP THE SCRAPE” which is worn,
as we all know, by Personna Super Stainless Steel Blade
users who, as we all know, are proud to proclaim to the
world that they have found a blade which gives them
luxury shave after luxury shave, which comes both in
double-edge style and Injector style, which does indeed
scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull, and oust —
the ouch, which shaves so closely and quickly and truly
and beautifully that my heart leaps to tell of it. (If per-.
haps you think me too effusive about Personna, I ask you
to remember that to me Personna is more than just a
razor blade; it is also an employer. )

But I digress. I make frequent trips, as I say, to learn
what is currently vexing the American undergraduate.
Last week, for example, while visiting a prominent Eas-
tern university (Idaho State) I talked to a number of
engineering seniors who posed a serious question, Like
all students, they had come to college burning to fill them-
selves with culture, but, alas, because of all their science
requirements, they simply had had no time to take the
liberal arts courses their young souls lusted after. “Are
we doomed,” they asked piteously, “to go through life
uncultured?”

I answered with a resounding “No!” I told them the
culture they had missed in college, they would pick up
after graduation. I explained that today’s enlightened
corporations are setting up on-the-job liberal arts pro-
grams for the newly employed engineering graduate—
courses designed to fill his culture gap—for the truly en-
lightened corporation realizes that the truly cultured em-
ployee is the truly valuable employee.

To illustrate, I cited the well-known case of Champert
Sigafoos of Purdue.

When Champert, having completed his degree in wing
nuts and flanges, reported to the enlightened corporation
where he had accepted employment, he was not rushed
forthwith to a drawing board. He was first installed in
the enlightened corporation's training campus. Here he
was given a beanie, a room-mate, and a copy of the com-
pany rouser, and the enlightened corporation proceeded
to fill the gap in his culture. . ;

First he was taught to read, then to print capital let-
ters, then capital and small letters. (There was also an
attempt to teach him script, but it was ultimately
abandoned.)

From these fundamentals, Champert progressed slowly
but steadily through the more complex disciplines. He
was diligent, and the corporation was patient, and in the
end they were well rewarded, for when Champert fin-
ished, he could play a clavier, parse a sentence, and name
all the Electors of Bavaria. .

Poised and cultured, Champert was omptly placed in
an important executive position. I am Pleased to report
that he served with immense distinction—not, however,
for long because three days later he reached retirement

age.

Today, still spry, he lives in St. Petersburg, Florida,
where he supplements his pension by parsing sentences
for tourists. eee © 108, Mas Beeiman
Here’s a sentence that’s easy to parse: Subject—“you.”
Verb—“double.” Object—“your shaving comfort when
you use Burma-Shave, regular or me along with
your Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades.”
