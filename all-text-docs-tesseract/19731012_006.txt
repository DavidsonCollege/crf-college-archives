Slighted Females Play

Old Jack walked slowly up the
stairs within the House of
Madam Davidson. It was early
morning. Jack’s uniform was
spotless and his bow-tie was
perfectly straight. It always
was in the early morning when
no one would see him.

Later in the day, the tie would
be at a slant and his suit would
be tarnished from the cleaning
up job that he performed. Then
people would see him.

Jack went to the maintenance
closet that he referred to as his
“‘office.’"’ Tacked to the door

never affected Jack anymore.

He remembered that many
years ago the magnetic beauty
of their nakedness had caused
him to long for them. He wanted
to know them all; he wanted to
claim them all.

Two of the girls had
especially attracted him -
Psychology and Education. He
had pursued them in every way.

He had touched them lightly on
their warm surfaces and then
delved deeply into their very
essences.

He had known them totally
and no longer yearned for them.
The longing was over. Now he
could deal objectively with
them.

Jack glanced at his watch - it
was too early for the girls to be
awakening. ‘‘Why are you up so
early?’’ he asked while mop-
ping the floor.

None at first answered. The
gentle Classics then looked up
and answered, ‘This was a
weekend that Dionysus would
have approved of.”’

Jack stopped mopping and
looked up, ‘“‘Speak in English,
honey.”

The graceful lady English
had just left the bathroom. She
looked over when she heard her
name and said, ‘‘Gladly wolde I
lerne and gladly teche - but if
no one pays any attention to me
how can I doeither?”

Then all of the girls started
complaining. They all chattered
at once so that in the utter chaos
none were heard.

The huge, muscle-bound
woman P. E. stepped from her
room. She looked around at the
confusion. She yelled, ‘“‘Hey!"
But she was not heard.

She yelled again, ‘‘Hey!"’ But

again no one heard her.

Around her neck she wore a
silver whistle. She took it up to
her fat lips and blew it for-
cefully. The girls were startled
and the confusion stopped.

“There, that's better,” P. E.
shouted. “‘Now, what's allthat
ruckous ‘bout. I'm an athlete
and we athletes need our sleep.
So tell me - what tha hell's goin
on?”

Humanities looked up. In her
soft, tender voice she explained,
‘All this past weekend, because
of Homecoming, no one - not one
single student - paid the
slightest bit of attention to us.
They all brought in girls, or
dated coeds, or just drank
whiskey and tears alone by
themselves - but they paid no at-
tention to us. It was so

‘So? Is that any reason to
wake me up?” P. E. snapped.

‘““Of course you wouldn't un-
derstand,"’ Philosophy whined,
‘‘No one ever pays any attention
to you anyway - not even on
the weekdays. So you're used to
it.”

‘Hard To Get’

Humanities joined in, “You
see, we're used to being ignored
a little on weekends. But not
completely.”

“And we're really angry
about it,” Philosophy said. “We
must do something to those
guys to show them that they
can’t just ignore us for three
whole days and then expect to
find everythng all right. It
would be quite illogical for us to
forgive them. so, therefore. I'm
not!”

Jack had finished mopping
the first section of the hall. All
the while he had listened to the
girls’ complaints. He propped
his mop against the wall and,
pushing his hair back out of his
eyes, he walked over to them.

He began, ‘‘I've been
listening to you the whole time.
And I have a suggestion. I've
been here with you girls a
fairly long time. You've all
given me suggestions and I've
given you some.

“I’ve cleaned up after you. |
helped organize you. Whenever
you have a problem you come to
me. Whenever there's a conflict

between the two of you, I've
been the meditator.

‘So trust me and follow my
advice. This week play hard-to-
get with the students. Don't let
them feel that just because they
paid their money, that they can
pass over you with no effort.

“Rather, don’t let them un-
derstand you. Become im-
possible. Do things with them
that they’ve never heard of or
even imagined.

‘Then they'll understand that
they can’t play around without
you quite so easily. They'll then
realize that they must include
you in all of their activities."’

Each of the girls became
elated with Jack's proposal. He
began to scrub walls. They
talked among themselves and
came up with hundreds of new

tricks, positions, and
propositions with which to
terrify the students.

Giggling to themselves they
went back to sleep. And they
dreamed of confused students
with panicked expressions.

Lawyer Discovers New Pot Defense

The traditional and often unseccessful defense in
marijuana cases has been to argue that either the
defendant was searched illegally or that he was not in
possession at the time of arrest. However, the ap-
parently perfect pot defense has been discovered by a
bright young Miami attorney, Richard Essen. Essen
successfully challenged Florida Statute 404, which,
like other pot laws across the nation, defines pot as
Cannabis sativa.

Essen based his defense of 20-year-old Ruby D.
Wilcox on the scientifically supported fact that at
least three of four species of pot exist and that Statute
404 states that only possession of the Cannabix sativa
is illegal.

Harvard professor Richard Schultes, a recognized
authority on botanic hallucinogens, noted that after
the leaves are broken, as in the case with 99 per cent
_ of the samples taken from suspects, there is no know
test that will identify one species from the other.

The standard police test for the presense of
marijuana—dousing it with a chemical that turns it
bright purple-- produces exactly the same effect in all
species. The defense asked the police chemists to
prove that the marijuana taken from the accused was
specifically the species Cannabis sativa, the species
cited in Statute 404.

The police chemists and Prosecuter John O’Donnel
were totally unprepared for such a defense, while the
jury was left with no alternative but to return a ver-
dict of innocent. Wilcox, with a clean record, had
refused to plead guilty in exchange for reduction of
the offense from felony to misdemeanor.

There to be little doubt that the Wilcox case
will be favored by pot smokers and their attorneys.
Says Essen, ‘‘My telephone has barey stopped. I’ve
had calls from New York to California and Alaska.
I’m now in the process of
Critics might say it’s nit-picking and that all we’re
doing is leaning on a technicality. But the fact
remains that the laws of the land must be followed ot
the letter.”’

“Last Tango In Paris”

‘Last Tango In Paris’’ begins with two pain-
tings by Francis Bacon. These show a man,
perhaps the same man, in a lying down and a
sitting position.

Subtly, through brushstrokes and form, these
portraits suggest an air of decadence and disin-
tegration. The subject seems to be aging, losing
his sexuality, yet at the same time he seems to
have nothing left to him but sex. No hope,
nothing.

These paintings crystallize Bertolucci’s in-
tentions in making “Last Tango in Paris."’ He
sees himself and Brando as like this man.

At one point in the film. Brando is
photographed in a pose very like these figures.

Later. he is shown in a mirror which is spot-
ted as one of the canvases had been.

This” is meant to be a film whose action is

true to human experience. Occasionally, it
succeeds.

Paul and Jeanne (Brando and Schneider)
seem moderately like an older man and the
younger woman he is having an affair with.

There is one scene in which a mood of melan-
choly languor following a sex bout is
beautifully expressed.

Only one moment, however, full
what the film needs throughout. Y captures

After his affair with Jeanne has gotten un-
derway, Paul walks out of the apartments a
renewed man. Heholds thedoor openforJeanne,
tears down the “‘apartment for rent’ si

Most of the movie is not at all like this.

Betolucci and Brando wrote the screenplay,
which seems to prove that they cannot write at
all. Especially Brando, his interminable

takes place in one room or a couple of rooms.

an exorbitantly stylized manner.

This means that Bertolucci must find a new
form. He does not; rather he and his camera
tend to merely sit and wait for Brando to finish
his scenes.

The film is at its best when Brando is absent
or in the few scenes in which Bertolucci has
managed to speed Brando up, knock him out of
his whining and weeping, and get a really good,
taut, tight performance out of him.

_ The last 15 minutes are rich indeed. Brando
is at his best, and unconditionally approved of
him for the first time in my experience (really,
a sampling) of his long and valuable career.

Bertolucci, whose direction usually sticks to
the screen like molasses, comes very close to
precisely defining movement (in some parts of
the tango contest) for the first time in any of
the three movies I have seen by him.

Even Vittorio Storaro, the cinematographer,
has his best moment ( in this film, at any rate)
toward the end. Only Schneider remains
inadequate, reminding me of Ava Gardner as
she popped in on Haston’s and William's and
especially Deborah Kerr's big “‘Night of the
Iguana”’ scene.

I have seen ‘Last Tango in Paris’’ four

times, and each time the last seems
fresher and more exciting. pars

‘Last Tango” is now in its fourth month at
the Janus Theaters in Greensboro.
