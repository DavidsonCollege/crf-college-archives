Fund: New Head, Old Pains

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

When Sandy Carnegie moved
into his new position as head
of the Wildcat Club last Tues-
day, he found his office com-
pletely furnished.

There were pictures on the
wall of all Southern Confer-
cuce champion teams of the past
two years, stacks of computer
lists filled with names of alum-
ni, friends and other potential
givers, and a -chart breaking
down donations by desired sizes.

There were also the problems
of the year-and-a-half old or-
ganization.

The Wildcat Fund was creat-
ed two years ago by the trus-
tees who sought to save some
of the college's money being
poured into football.

The fund is set up to raise
money for football scholarships
through alumni contributions.

It failed to reach its scholar-
ship goal in both the 1970 and
1971 drives.

“But we're very optimistic,”
Carnegie stated. ‘‘We_ raised
$80,000 in the half year of 1970
and $120,000 last year. That’s a
50 per cent increase, a big up-
swing.”

Camegie said that he felt that

the giving would continue to rise
at its present rate, and the
Club would meet its projected
need of $160,000, the same
amount projected for the past
two seasons.

Both times the Club has failed
to raise enough monies, the col-
lege has made up the difference,
in order to give the organization
time to get on its feet.

But the Fund now has sev-
eral things going in its favor,
not the least of which is Car-
negie, who has almost 30 years
of experience as a salesman for
various companies around the
Charlotte area.

One of the biggest new assets
the Fund has is its recent merg-
er with the Wildcat Club, the
Davidson sports booster club.

Now all contributions to the
football scholarship prgram are
made the Wildcat Club, and
are fully tax-deductable. They
are officially contributions to
Davidson College.

Carnegie also has several pro-
motional ideas to draw more
money from alumni.

“We have over 10,000 liv-
ing alumni,” he stated, ‘‘and if
we could get just 20 per cent
giving, or maybe less, we could
easily reach our goal.”

One of Carnegie’s projected
plans is to try to get past foot-
ball players from a_ particular
class to donate one scholarship,
or $3,300.

“Say there are 30 players
from the class of °56. We'll go to
them and say ‘We want a full
scholarship from your class.
You had a free ride when you
were at Davidson, so now help
a kid who needs it like you
did’.””

Another project is to solicit
local businessmen for good-will
contributions.

Carnegie stands very strongly
in favor of subsidized football
because “it helps foster diver-
sity in the student body”.

But he is also in favor of the
Wildcat Club approach to schol-
arship funding because “it puts

Falconi-less "Cats Beat ECU,
Tackle Bulldogs ‘Tomorrow

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

“If they're that good without
him, think what they would be
with him.”

You couldn't blame Southern
Conference coaches for saying
that after the Wildcats, minus
backcourt star John Falconi,
devastated East Carolina last
Tuesday 92-79.

Falconi suffered an ankle in-
jury in the 80-66 win over Wake
Forest last Saturday, but his
absence was hardly noticed as
the ‘Cats completely outclassed
the Pirates.

The offensive thrust was pro-
vided by Joe Sutter amd pivot
man Eric Minkin, who explod-
ed for 27 and 22 points respec-
tively.

Riding a six-game _ winning
streak into last night’s game
with VMI, the Wildcats travel to
The Citadel tomorrow for an-
other conference test.

The Bulldogs should be rated

the monkey on the back of the
people that want it’.

So, Carnegie is happy in his
new office, and he is ready to
start reorganizing it to suit his
tastes—with mew programs and
without the problems.

as the surprise team in the
league this year, because they
are waging a tough battle for
third place with East Carolina.

John Sutor, an aggressive 6-8
center, is the leading pointmak-
er for the Bulldogs, and he uses
his 225 pounds under the boards
very effectively as a rebounder.

The backcourt of Jim Below
and Steve Fishel is not flashy,
but the two are a steadying in-
fluence cm the club and they
play rugged defense.

The contest will be regionally
televised.

The real showdown comes
Tuesday when the ’Cats invade
the territory of the Furman Pal-
adins in hopes of avenging an
earlier defeat.

Russ Hunt of the Paladins
stands as the leading scorer in
the conference, and with big
and mobile Roy Simpson he
gives the Paladins a_ strong
frontcourt.

One factor working against
the Paladins will be their rig-
orous schedule -prior to the
game.

In an emotional 91-90 loss to
Jacksonville last Monday, the
Paladins were plagued by foul
trouble and a costly turnover in
the last 12 seconds of play.

Jacksonville visited Furman
yesterday, and the Paladins en-
tertain East Carolina tomorrow
before the Wildcats arrive.

Furman coach Joe Williams
scouted the 'Cats at both the
Princeton and East Carolina
games, and the ’Cats gave him
an eyeful on both occasions.

' John Pecorak led the scoring
against Wake Forest with 18,
and collected 12 rebounds. In
addition to their fine scoring
against ECU, Minkin and Sut-
ter controlled the boards and
played very aggressive defense.

The injury to Falconi knocked
a little of the wind out of the
‘Cat sails, but the 6-5 sopho-
more hopes to be able to prac-
tice in about ten days.

“IT hope to be back for the
Duke, Dayton and South Caro-
lina games and then go full
speed for the conference tour-
nament,” Falconi explained.

Falconi admitted that the in-
jury came at a time when he
was beginning to develop into
a complete player, a goal for
which he has been striving.

“I got hurt at a bad time, be-
cause I have the confidence I
didn’t have earlier. My defense
has improved, but a lot of that
comes from the team's over-all
defensive improvement,” he not-
ed.

The team did not appear to
miss Falconi in the East Caro-
lina game as much as had been
feared, and he attributed this to

Parker Shows Strength, Speed

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

Big man Sheldon Parker of
the Davidscn Wildkittens has
‘‘unlimited potential” according
to coach Jim Larranaga, but
still has ‘‘a long way to go.”

The 6-9 center for the 11-1
freshman team has done a
“great job working on rebound-
ing, especially on the defensive
boards. He’s also progressed a
lot on his jump shot,” com-
mented Larranaga.

There are three things a big
man should have in basketball
in Larranaga’s view. First, that
he be strong. Second, he should
be able to run and finally be
able to jump.

“Sheldon has all these phys-
ical attributes, plus a great men-
tal attitude towards the game,”
Larranaga says.

If Parker has any weaknesses,
they are his lack of both play-
ing experience, and lack of con-
centration, in the coach’s opin-
ion.

Parker agrees especially on
the latter point, and personally
attributes it to a less than av-
erage performance in Tuesday
night’s 104-75 win over East
Carolina.

Despite this, he dumped in 29
points and pulled down 11 re-
bounds.

Greg Dunn led the scoring in
that game, nosing out Parker
with 30 points.

Parker placed third in scoring
in the ’Kittems 73-68 win over
the Wake Forest Little Deacs,
with 13 behind Dunn’s 20 and
Larry Horowitz's 14.

“The coaches helped me with

a lot of individual work, things
I never worked on before,” com-
mented Parker.

From his point of view, it's
“‘my offensive moves that need
the greatest improvement—that
and centrolling the ball.”

Despite his size, Parker isn’t
the one leading the team in
scoring.

‘As to this last point, he is
quick to note that the Kitten’s
Style of play is ‘‘the combined
effort of everybody, not just one

person.”

Playing erratically all season,
with some poor styles of play
behind him, Parker thinks his
best game so far was the Kit-
tens 87-67 romp over V.M.I. at
the Keydet’s home Jan. 18.

“That’s when I got it all to-
gether,’ exclaimed Parker.

The big man is only sorry
that the freshman team doesn't
get another chance to meet
Clemson. ‘‘I’m sure we could
beat them,” he says.
