John Collins Sings “Come Ye

Evening Vesper

Vespers last Sunday, ted by, Prot
P. H. Gwynn, Ph. 19., opened witl
“Day is Dying intthe West” as the

processional hymn, in which the con-

gregation joined at the second verse.

After the scripture, read by Dr
Gwynn, who is professor of educa
tion and Freshman counselor, John
Collins sang, “Come, Ye Blessed”

Issues of Life

The subject of the evening sermon
was, “Testing the Issues .of Life”
the text being Thessalonians 21:1
Dr. Gwynn brought out the facts
that education was a- hard-earned

goal; that although an education

should broden the outlook, sharpen

theewits, and develop the soul, hun-

dreds of men go through college

Without reaching these aims; ‘and

that extra-curricular activities and

selfish interests should never inter-

fere with scholastic achievement.

Dr. Gwynn continued to point out

that one thing an education can do

for men is prevent them from be

coming insincere patriots and unfair

citizens.

“Davidson men particularly,” the
speaker continued, “are inclined to
substitute réligious formalities for
true faith.”

“Counterfeit personalities and
counterfeit beliefs will be severely

tested. by life in the next few years,”
concluded Dr. Gwynn, i
his roommate along. with their

dates drove to Atlanta Friday morn

ing to witness the-Georgia Tech
