Watson Recipients Pursue International Projects

By DAVID VAN PELT

At least two Davidson seniors
do not have to worry about their
plans for next year. Seniors Beth
Maczka and Ginna McGee will
pursue international study pro-
jects next year as recipients of
1985 Watson Scholarships. The
$10,000 fellowship grants which
were announced this week will
allow Maczka to study women’s
concerns in India and McGee to
photograph Catholic pilgrimages

in Europe and Central America.
Maczka, a Center major, be-
came interested in the role of
women in Indian culture during a
trip to India last summer. She said
she was shocked by the repressed
position of women in Indian cul-
ture, caused in part by the dowry
system of marriage. She noted the
common practice of “bride-burn-
ing” in which the husband mur-
ders his wife, typifies the repre-
ssed position of women in Indian

Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity
will return to Patterson Court
under the terms of a decision
reached by College President John
Kuykendall. According to a letter
to fraternity President Scott
Purdy, SPE may occupy a house
on Patterson Court as a social
house, at first.

Kuykendall granted SPE a
one-year variance regarding the
requirement that the house serve
meals. Another one-year variance
could then be requested, subject to
review by the Council on Campus
and Religious Life (CCRL) and
the Patterson Court Council. The
house would have to begin serving
meals by fall term, 1987.

Former SPE President Steve
MacMillan said the fraternity
members’ reaction to the decision
was positive. MacMillan said the
fraternity was eager to become
“more involved with the college
community.” He said more in-

volvement was the reason. SPE
wanted to move back on campus

culture according to Maczka.
Nevertheless. Maczka contends
that a women’s movement ts
originating in India, and she will
study three communities that she
said exhibit an enlightened at-
titude toward women in Indian so-
ciety.

One group which fascinated
Maczka during her trip to India
last summer was the Catholic
Samaritan Sisters, who serve the
poor and infirm in rural and urban

Security Issues Affect Dorms

By TED WILSON

Dorm row will have a new
look next fall as the College will
locate more women on the central
part of campus. In addition, if the
College perfects the lock system
currently on Knox, other dorms
may have similar devices next
year, according to Housing Direc-
tor Bill Bolding.

Dorm changes include reserv-
ing the basement, as well as the
first, second, and third floors of
Belk, for freshman men. Second
Little has been reserved for men
and fourth Little for the overflow
of freshmen. Third and fourth
Sentelle and first and second West
Duke are designated for women,
while first East Knox and second
Knox have been saved for men.

Bolding said one reason for
changing the dorm composition
was security, as the change will
“get more women on this [central ]
part of the campus.”

In addition to composition
changes, dorms may have lock
systems by next fall. Bolding
said, “We're still working the
bugs out of the [Knox] system.”
He added, “We're trying to per-
fect it to the way we want it” be-
fore committing to an expansion
of the system.

Bolding said he hopes the sys-
tem will be perfected by the sum-
mer. He added that “the more
[labor] we do ourselves,” the
more the cost of the lock system
can be defrayed. The Knox sys-
tem cost approximately $2,200
for three doors.

More housing changes may be
in store in the future. As the ad-
ministration works toward hous-
ing 90 percent of Davidson stu-
dents on campus, Bolding said.
“The College may eventually
build some new, varied housing”
that may include student apart-
ments.

This winter, because of zon-
ing laws, Henderson and Derby
houses filed for and received a
variance for zoning, according to
Mayor Russell Knox. The Board
of Adjustors granted the College a
one-year extension on the use of
the houses which, according to
Bolding, are “non-conforming
uses with zoning laws.”

Bolding said residence halls
are not permitted in single family
zoning districts. Until now, “the
College has been given time to
work it [the zoning problem] out.”
Bolding said.

Mayor Knox said after this
year the College could reapply for
another variance of zoning for
Henderson and Derby Houses but
that it “is a mutual desire of the
College and town” to house poten-
tial residents of these houses on
campus by the 1986-87 scheol
year.

rather than find another off-cam-
pus site. MacMillan feels that the
other houses on the Court support
the move. He added that he felt
SPE would continue to grow and
be strong.

Next fall the 89 members of
the fraternity will move into the
house formerly occupied by ETC.
During spring term they will be
cleaning up the house, which is
presently used for storage. They
hope to host social events spring
term to help the house become a
part of Patterson Court.

SPE’s return to campus re-
sulted from much deliberation by
the CCRL and by Kuykendall.
The CCRL voted last term to
allow campus groups not provid-
ing meals to operate Patterson
Court houses. However, no spe-
cific criteria governing such
houses was set. Results of the
CCRL votes on the issue were
then presented to Kuykendall. Ac-
cording to Assistant to the Presi-
dent Rick Love. Kuykendall felt

ate missions throughout
India, and Maczka_ plans to
examine the way in which the
Catholic sisters interact with their
community,

Maczka will also spend time
with a Hindu women’s spiritual
community, which offers 30 sis-
ters and eight brothers the oppor-
tunity for a contemplative. self-
sufficient life dedicated to
spiritual advancement. “One of
the main things these sisters be-
lieve in is the relationship between
science and spirituality,” she said.

vision under which SPE will come
back on campus was intended to
give members as much latitude as
possible, particularly those mem-
bers who had joined the fraternity
without committing to dining.

Sophomore CCRL member
Bobby Houck said he was pleased
with Kuykendall’s decisions. He
said the CCRL’s concern was that
the fraternity should provide eat-
ing operations, and that the deci-
sion reached was a flexible one.
