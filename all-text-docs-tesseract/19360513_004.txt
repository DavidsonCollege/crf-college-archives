_ Varsity Athletic Program

THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 13, 1936

With the mid-season hue and cry

of the baseball season ringing in

~our cars we now come to bid good-
bye to another year-ot sports at
Davidson. We have played the best
teams; we have won and we have
lost: but in Our midst there are
still those who have had tw ability
all the while but have never re-
ceived notice of their achievements.
When the day comes for athletes
of today to become the coaches of
tomorrow. perhaps we'shall jind one
of the unknowns gracing ene of the
top rungs of the ladder. Like the
famous swimming coach who can't
even swim,

With the dawning of gradua-
tion breaking over our campus,
it always seems we will never
fill the vacancies left in our
ranks. But with the coming of
another campaign, there inevit-
ably come new stars that force
us to forget the old. Last year
the topics of general sports con-
versation were Johnny Mack-
orell, Boody Wingfield, Dewey
Hutchins, Jim Morgan, Charles
Harris, John Seivers, and Char-
lie Fort. This year in their
places have come others—sen-
iors, juniors and sophomores—
who will hold these posts until
taking leave. Then the process
of filling the ranks begins again.
This year we've cheered and
praised many, with Paul Pitt-
man, Henry Cathey, Cole Wind-
ham, Wood Leroy
Blackwelder, Carlyle Lewis.
Jack Jenkins, and Bill Mer-
chant sharing the limelight. Our

the best record of any of the ath-

return for the season next year, but

Hemphill on base, starting Ure ac-

one of his Dlows being a” triple.
Swede Johnson got three hits in fiye

WORK ON STADIUM 10
COMMENCE AT ONCE

New Improvements to Be Com-
pleted By Fall

Thére are to be changes -in- the
arrangement of the track and the
baseball diamond as a redult of the
construction_of the new stadium
recently given by Messrs. Smith and
Lamsiord Richardson. |

The. present. plans call for the
building of a new baseball diamond
on the Freshman Field and an en-
largement and improvement of the
track. Phe new stands on Richard-
son Field are to be erected at a con-
siderable distance from the eastern
side at we track.

be widened by moving. it farther

both behind the plate asd{o the east and also Uke width of

fle track proper is to be enlarged.
Thus the new track will be “fat-
and contain more lanes.

There are several plans proposed
for altering the Freshman Field
to suit the needs of a baseball dia-
mond. The most Bkely plan would
include the cutting away of some
of the road, the placing ‘of home
plate in the northwest corner of the
field. and the building up of Ieft
field with the earth taken from
the road. All the old field needs is
an enlarging of left field which is
now short.

A fence will be built around the
Freshinan Field and the bleachers
will be used to accommodate the
spectators. Any of the * several
plans now under consideration will
provide an excellent diamond which
will be used as the main one. It. is
expected that the present diamond
will be leit in condition and used
as a practice field. This field is only
impaired by the new stands in as
much as it shortens center field.

At the same time the size of the
track is changed its condition ‘will
be greatly improved. A good. solid
bed that will not wash with every
shower is expected to make a decid-
ed ditferenee in its quality. With
the inéreasing popularity of track,
accommodations are to be provided
for the holding of meets here that
might be larger than duat mects.
The altered track will be exactly

S80 yards long or one quarter of a
mile.

The new stadium wilt be in. its
