Brodie Experience Causes
‘Reverberating Circuits’

During the past year I have
developed a keen interest in the
film experience, in what hap-
pens to a person when he sits
in a darkened room and allows
light passed through celluloid
and bounced off a white screen
to be absorbed by his retina.

What causes this illusion to
assume so much the dimensions
of reality that it can make one
laugh, cry, or become physical-
ly sick?

Until last Friday night I had
approached this phenomenon in
a very individual and personal
manner.

isolated from his neighbors in

Queens College Promotes
Rationale Of Girls’ Schools

AN ANALYSIS
By DON PARMAN

Editor-in-Chief

As Davidson College adminis-
trators have discovered in re-
cent years, it has become in-
creasingly difficult to convince
students and prospective stu-
dents on the idea of a single
sex college.

Queens College has started a
promotional campaign aimed at
convincing the general public,
not particularly its own student
body, on the merits of the wom-
en’s college.

John E. Smylie, president of
Queens College, stated ‘‘We’re
tired of playing dead ip the face
of doom prophets who say the
women’s college is near death
or close to it.

‘‘Her pulse may have flutter-
ed, but she is far from bei
critically ill. In fact, no accu-
rate or conclusive diagnosis of
her case — fatal or not — has
yet been made.”

Apart from the obvious ques-
tions as to the health of Queens
College or women’s colleges in
general (and I would remind
President Smylie that his is a
doctorate of philosophy, not
medicine), the chief interest in
it is the justification of women’s
colleges which is put forth.

“There's something special

LETTER

about a woman, ... and wom-
en’s colleges” according to the
claims. The answer which
Queens College would pass on
is that most women need a
women’s school to fully realize
themselves as human beings.

But the rationale is quite con-
trad:ctory.

While the ideas are broadly
based on the concept of the
liberated woman, the same
ideas can be quite reactionary
at the same time.

It is asserted that woman
must have a separate but equal
environment so that they can
learn to be first class citizens.
to avoid intellectual deferrence
to males, and to have access
to the equivalent equipment.

And the blacks should go to
separate but equa! schools so
that they can learn to be first
class citizens.

Social advantages are alluded
to, “You will discover the ad-
vantage of being your own
woman, of playing the dating
game on your own terms, with-
out constantly being on dis-
play.”

None of which sounds as if
it need be reason for the liber-
ated woman to whom the drive
is addressed to select a wom-
en’s college over a comparable
coeducational school.

Seniors Resent Demands
Of Anonymous Polling

To The Editor:

The Davidson student is ask-
ed to fill out many question-
naires; surely this is little
enough to ask of him.

But, even if he is not re
quired to give his name, it is
unfair to ask the student for
information when the inquirer
states neither his own identity
nor the purpose for which the
information will be used.

Besides being a matter of
common courtesy, it is a basic
right of the student to know
why his opinions are being sol-
icited.

A recent example of such a
case is the Voter Registration
Poll. Other questionnaires sent
out last year were also guilty
of this.

Realizing that in most cases
this action is merely an over-
sight, we nevertheless believe
this information needs to be
supplied. It is little enough for
the student to ask in return.

It is easy, almost natural, to
react against the slick justifica-
tions for the women’s college,
packaged in the latest ideas
and mind sets. The arguments
for a men’s college can have
no stronger inherent claims.

But at Davidson we continue
to try to sell the myth, ‘‘There’s
something special about a man,
and men’s colleges.”

darkness and silence; he brings
to the experience his own ex-
periences, and the film sets into
motion certain mental ‘‘rever-
berating circuits” unique in
each individual.

| say | approached the sub-
ject in this individualized man-
ner until last Friday. Last Fri-
day | attempted to watch The
Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in
the Morrison Room.

As a result of that experience
] have been forced to alter my
suppositions concerning the film
experience by dividing it into
two Categories: normal film ex-
perience and Davidson film ex-
perience.

The Davidson film experience
is not individual but community
in nature. One may sit in dark-
ness but he is forced NOT to
sit in silence. One is forced not
only to react to the film, but
also to the audience.

As the Davidson film experi-
ence is at such variance with
the norm I will here attempt
to break down the typical David-
son- reaction to a film into its
constituent parts:

1. Davidson student enters
screening room and announces
the same by screaming “focus”
or “sound” at the top of his
lungs.

2. As soon as the titles have

begun, D. C. student is compel-
led to demonstrate his native
intelligence by reading all non-
Anglo-Saxon credits aloud.

3. D. C. student shows he is
not duped by this two-dimension-
al-illusion-representing-reality by
carrying on a running dialogue
with Maggie Smith.

4. D. C. student shows his sex-
ual immaturity and inexperi-
ence by seeing sexual illusions
in bananas, girl’s physical edu-
cation class, a map of Spain,
and the succession of the
Stuarts, and double entendres
in every audible bit of dialogue.

5. If all else fails, student
falls back on his stock-in-trade
—insensitive cynicism—verbally
demonstrated, either by a nasal
snorting sound or the sharp ex-
pelling of air against the fore-
arm, in response to every scene
in which an interpersonal rela-
tionship advances past saluta-
tions.

There is a scene in The Prime
of Miss Jean Brodie in which
an art master is explaining the
curved line to a class of adol-
escent school girls. Using a
painting as an aid, he points
out examples of the curve.
When he mentions ‘‘breasts’’ as
such an example, the class
erupts into tittering and snick-
ering. In this scene, D. C. movie-
goers, see yourselves.

Profit-Mad Committee Says
Love Story Is For Lovers

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

What can you say about a
24-year-old girl that died? That
she was a tough bag? That she
could do the twist? Or that it
seems a waste to show a film
about her to Davidson students
on a big weekend?

Whatever the answer, Love
Story will make an appearance
in the Morrison Room of the
college union during Homecom-
ing through the efforts of the
Popular Films Committee.

Rejecting past traditions that
have brought such winners as
Romeo and Juliet to the local
screen, a vocal minority is
grumbling about the dubious
taste involved in the selection
of Erich Segal’s classic.

Senior Robin Gray, chairman
of the Popular Films Commit-
tee, defended the choice: ‘In
the tradition of big weekends,
the committee has tried to ap
peal to the romantic inclina-
tions of the student body and
in particular their female
guests.

“It is the belief of the com-
mittee,” he added, “‘that the
film will sell tickets. Whether
or not the film will provide in-
tellectual enlightenment for the
students is another question en-
tirely.”

Gray explained that the com-
mittee operates on a profit-loss
budget, and must choose its
films accordingly. This group is
the only one in the Union Board
which is self-supported and al-

Ways comes out’ ahead at the
end of the year.

“Since we operate on this
type of budget,” said Gray,
“movies are selected on the
basis of whether or not they
will make a profit, not for their
aesthetic edification. The latter

is left to the Fine Films Com- -

mittee. The purpose of our films
is sheer entertainment.”

The popular films usually
number from 25-30 films per
year, that is, one each week if
the Morrison is not taken for
other functions.

The selection committee for
the films is open to anyone who
wants to participate, although

LETTER

only about 6-8 students ever
show up. Criterion for selection
include the availability of a cer-
tain film in addition to its box
office appeal. °

Thus Love Story will go on.
It’s funny that while many com-
plain of intellectual castration
at Davidson, there is little evid-
ence to support it.

While five or six devotees
might populate the Green Room
for a poetic reading or the Phi
Hall for a symposium, the vast
majority of students will most
likely be found packed into
Morrison at 8 p.m. watching
some real culture-cookie like
Jane Fonda do her thing as
Barbarella.

Love Repudiates Succop

To The Editor:

There is some controversy
about exactly who finished
eighty-first in the recent fresh-
man cake race and it seems to
have been caused by Gus Suc-
cup. A politician should attempt
to get his facts straight before
making a public statement.

Just for the record, the mat-
ter was settled beyond question
shortly after the race was fin-
ished. Mrs. A. R. Brownson, a
very nice Davidson resident,
had intended to bake but had
not.

She was determined for the
xuy who came so close to have
a cake, though, and as _ the of-

ficial No. 81, | was called and
told of her intention. Late Thurs-
day afternoon I picked up the
biggest, most delicious choco-
late cake you’ve ever seen,

I, too, not only boast a whole
grandstand of masochists, my
hall counselor and whole living
body, but also Mrs. Brownson’s
chocolate cake as proof that I
was Bist.

- So if there is a coed on cam-
pus who feels sorry for ol’ Gus,
bake him an angel food cake
with chocolate icing. His room
is Sentelle 110, but his number
was 82. .
