THE DAVIDSONIAN

Page S-

With the curtain rapidly descending on the spring sports |
scene, we were finally treated toa preview of the asset
football season last week when the official 1947 Wildcat

schedule was made public by Athletic Director Norman
Shepard. The new card calls for ten contests, including

seven games with Southern Conference foes. As a matter} departments, the Black “Knights”

of fact, it is almost an exact duplicate of last year’s doc-
ket. The only changes are the substitution of Elon College

for Erskine and the addition of the powerful William and}

Mary Indians.

The biggest tests for Coach Bill Story’s grid-
ders will come on successive Saturdays (Sept. 27th
and Oct. 4th) when they lock horns with the
Braves and North Carolina State’s Wolfpack. Both
of these squads are loaded with talent and should
be in the thick of the fight for the loop crown,
along with North Carolina’s great Tar Heels.
“Touchdown” Turner has finally graduated from
the Raleigh institution, but Coach Beaty Feathers
has two top notch tail back replacements in
Gwynn Fletcher and “Pitchin” Charlie’ Richkus,
hero of last season’s 13-7 win over Duke’s Blue
Devils. The ’Cats will, in all probability, drop these
two but with some added reserve strength they
should be able to put up a whale of a scrap against
their bigger rivals. :

he games which will make or break the season also
come on consecutive weekends, and are all with Virginia
elevens. In “46 the locals lost to all three of these key op-
ponents — namely V.M.1., Washington and Lee, and

Richmond. The Generals and the Spiders are definitely on,
the upswing athletically, and will take the field against}

the ’Cats as odds on favorites while the Cadet-Davidson
game will probably be rated as a tossup. It’s much too
early to make any accurate predictions, but it’s a sate
bet that the “47 Red and ‘Black machine will make these
plenty close, Story’s charges should win the- rest without
too much trouble, altho Hampden-Sydney’s woe begone
Tigers will be greatly improved with the ex-\V. MLL. Navy
flash, Lynn Chewing, leading the attack.
Barring injuries, the locals should have one of the best
_ starting elevens in the school’s history. The forward. wall,
led by Bill Boyd, who turned in a sparkling performance
from.his running guard slot in Friday's scrimmage, [rnie
Stricklin, Buddy Chandler, and Itasy Rhodes, is heavy,
fast,” and rugged. The battle for starting posts in- the
backfield is still wide open and no one is sure of a berth
as yet. The big question mark, however, is’ stillethe re

serves and we won't know definitely how the elub’ll stack

up against outsiders until that one is answered next fall.

“B” VARSITY DOINGS

Although the recent debut of the Wildcat “1B”. base-

ball squak! was anything but. encouraging it was-a step)

in the right direction. The 21-2 defeat at the hands of
Belmont Abbey-humiliating as it was, was to be expected
because the local nine that took the field against the preps
‘had never worked together before. As a. matter of faet
several of them had not even been out for baseball. Still
we hope that itll be continued inorder to give some—of
the aspirants much needed experience, to enable the coach-
ing staff to get a better line on future prospects, and to
supply the fans with some more home games to take in.

One of the few bright lights in the dismal showing a-

gainst the Abbey was Billy Bird who came to Davidson
as a-second sacker and was later moved over to the hot!

corner. The Fredericksburg kid. who for some unknown
reason hasn't seen much varsity action, tallied both Wild-
cat runs, blasted a double into the stands, and displayed
some mighty fancy footwork on the hasepaths.

BATTING THE BREEZE

Tomorrow will be the last big day on the
Davidson athletic fields. The baseballers will wind
up their activities with a game against Clemson’s
league-leading Tigers while Coach Pete Whittle’s
cinder artists will make their last home appearance
against Mercer .. . It’s tournament time in the
Southern Conference. The ’Cat golfers go to
Winston tomorrow and the trackmen journey to
Chapel Hill on the 16th and 17th for the annual
outdoor meet.
