| Oingo Boin go.

One of the more popular al-
. bums at this station in recent months
has been:the debut LP. by the octet

known collectively as Oingo Boin- ~

go. In this album the relatively new

group. (which previously had an EP.

-_ release)’ runs down ten smart pop
tunes in a manner that is slightly as-
kew of normality but instantly lika-
ble. It is rather difficult to pigeon-
hole this group with a restrictive lab-

. el such as “power pop” (although
they do play pop music which is
powerful), “robot rock”. (although
they. do employ synthesizers and
synthesized rhythms in most songs),
or “new funk punk” (although they

- do resemble the Talking Heads in
heir complicatedly funky rhythm
and in Danny Elfman’s wonderfully

over-the-edge singing). Basically,

Oingo Boingo plays an ’80’s synthe-
sis of pop styles. — |

It is when you reach. beyond the
basics that the intelligence, humor,
and musical complexity become ap-

parent. Danny Elfman’s songs bris-
tle with quirky hooks, and his sing-

ing is expertly supported by the rest’

of the band.. When Elfman yodels the

lyrics over a “boyesque” vamp in

“What You See” you begin to wond-

er, but in the end it all comes togeth-

er-to make you believe that he really
does know what ‘he’s doing. The
standout songs in this set are the fre-
netic “Only a Lad” (previously re-
leased On the EP, but in a remixed

and far superior version here on this:

album), the lasciviously sordid “Lit-
tle Girls” and “Nasty Habits,” and
the nifty electronic cover of Ray Da-
vies’s “You Really Got Me.”

As the frontman for this outfit,
Danny Elfman reminds me of the

type of childhood friend who would —

show you things under rocks, and
who liked to burn things. His fluid

vocals always seem to be laughing at

you, and at the “hip” conventions
and ideals of our time. When he
claims “There’s nothing wrong-with

capitalism,” he ridicules the children
of the bourgeoisie who support the
socialist workers while never having
worked themselves (and perhaps al-
so jabs at the socialist bands such as

. the Gang of Four). He states in

another ‘song “I wear the wrong

clothes / I say the wrong things. . . .
I’m on the outside.” If more bands
were on the outside with Oingo

Boingo, rather than being too ultra- —
hip for their own good, alternative
radio would be a more entertaining
adventure.
