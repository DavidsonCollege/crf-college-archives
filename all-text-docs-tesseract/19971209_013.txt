THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Carri Morris
Arts & Living Editor

Once again, Mr. and Mrs. Claus —
identities witheld for security purposes
— scaled down the front of Chambers
to ring in the Christmas season.

Ihave been going to this event for
three years now, and it never ceases to
amaze and delight me to see such a
turnout for this event. It is a perfect
mingling of local folk — adults and
children alike — and the throng of
Davidson kids that attend with enthusi-
asm.

The Christmas carols were led by
our very own Davidson College Con-
cert Choir, and Rob Spach read the
original Christmas story with integrity,
reminding us of the true meaning be-
hind the holiday season. And, the best
part of all, the lights came on in the
middle of all the singing and the crowd
cheered. There’s just something about
lights and crowds that produces excited
chaos.

What I love most about this Christ-
mas party is the fact that so many of us
take the time to attend,

Sunday nights around here are a
sad sight as we all tend to run in circles
trying to get academically stable for the
week to come. Especially right now as
finals loom like a train in the not-so-far-

Arts & Lis

off distance, the Christmas party al-
ways unexpectedly strikes me as a mo-
ment when I think how important it is
that we remember that the holidays are
right around the corner and that more
important things exist than passing that
Astronomy exam.

We can take the time to watch
Christmas cartoons, gather with candles
in the cold, drink hot cider, and sing
Christmas carols — as sappy and geeky
as it may seem.

My only concern is that we were
not provided with contraceptive devices
this year. I am sure that most know
where to obtain the proper protection,
but there was just something so won-
derfully controversial about the whole
“condoms off the roof of Chambers”
thing last year.

As a Davidsonian staff member, I
especially was disappointed not to be

able to run a headline such as “dental ©

dams for all, and to all a good night!

But, in all seriousness, I have no
complaints. The annual Christmas party
was extremely successful: Santa slid
down gracefully without a hitch, the
cookies were fabulous, Billy Roberts
was stunning as usual in his Christmas
tights, and for a brief moment in time,
final research papers were taking a
breather.

Happy Holidays and good luck!

Steele Creek Ramblers —
the grass is always bluer

By HEATHER LARSON
Guest Writer

I have a confession to make. I am
related to Jerry Clower. If the name
doesn’t ring a bell, let me assure you
that you’d know. him if you heard him.
Where might you hear him, o ye un-
Clowered ones? Why, through any
number of mediums: TV (he does com-
mercials for Sutherlands
“Whooooeeee! So come on down for
the best prices this side of the Mason
Dixon!”); live in concert (he does a
mean stand-up act); or perhaps ona tape
such as the one I found at a gas station,
titled “More Good ‘Uns’ where he re-
gales his audience with such tales as
“Coon huntin’ with a wheel barrow.”

Is this a plug for my extended
family members or am I writing about
the Steele Creek Ramblers, the blue-
grass band that performed on Saturday,
Dec.-6? This-brings me-to my second
confession: Until last night, I was liv-
ing under the assumption that bluegrass
was basically Jerry Clower set to music.

Try as my roommate of two years
might, she had been unable to convince
me of its legitimacy as real, live enter-
tainment (that wasn’t at the expense of
the entertainers) and I had turned up my
nose at ‘the very idea of a mandolin.

Forgive me?

Even as I entered the 900 Room
and saw the six gentleman dressed in
khakis and white shirts (with the excep-
tion of the banjo player, who distin-
guished himself with blue jeans and a
full head of hair) I was fairly convinced
that I might get a’nap in during the
show.

Not only was the music too engag-
ing and exciting to disassociate myself
from it, my foot tapping unconsciously
with their tight vocal harmonies and
quick fingers on the strings, but the
group members themselves were too
enchanting to not pay them attention.
Bantering between songs and _ edging
each other out to tell the next joke, the
audience was calling them by name and
urging them on with whoops and hollers
by the end of the evening.

Despite their self-proclaimed
maladies and recent illnesses, they ap-
peared: fit asa fiddle—the. one instru-
ment conspicuously lacking from their
ensemble. One fellow even grabbed
the bass away from another band mem-
ber (who he apparently thought was not
as enthusiastic as he might have been)
and started thumping the bass for the
last few songs. Now if someone could
just wrestle the mike away from Jerry
Clower. . .

Fly with these Wings

By Katie PALMER
Staff Writer

Almost invariably, the book is
better than the movie.

Because subtle character devel-
opment often gets left behind and sym-
bolism tends to be heavy-handed, it’s
uncom-
mon that
a director
can suc-
cessfully
translate
a n
author’s
voice into
film. If
y ou
haven't
read the
book, the
movie can seem tedious.

The Wings of the Dove, the film
version of Henry James’ turn-of-the-
century novel, however, is a rare ex-
ample of a novel-turned-movie that
can stand on its own.

Helena Bonham Carter is Kate
Croy, a young Londoner who must
choose between the financial support
of her wealthy aunt and the love of
working class Merton Densher. Kate
repeatedly refuses Merton’s marriage
proposals while her aunt tries to marry
her off to a wealthy older man.

When the young and beautiful
American heiress Millie Theale visits,
the two become best friends.

Ill and realizing that death is fast
approaching, Millie convinces Kate and
Merton to accompany her to Venice as
part of her final European adventure.

@ An every which way love trinagle

Unaware of Kate and Merton’s pas-
sionate history, sexual tensions run
high.

The director’s subtlety is the
movie’s strong point.. For example,
Millie and Kate’s friendship assumes
lesbian undertones at times but is left
unexplored, allowing us as an audi-
ence to interpret.

While James
could only use words to
tell his story, the direc-
tor makes use of visual
images and sound and
is incredibly sensual.
The scenes in Venice
are full of music, festi-
vals, and color. The;
film is highly erotic in
its portrayals of physi-
cal intimacy, leaving
details to the viewer’s
imagination, a practice that I think
Hollywood all too-often ignores.

On the ride back from the Manor
Theater in Charlotte — the closest
theater featuring the film — we
couldn’t stop making connections be-
tween scenes, What was the signifi-
cance of the constant rain? What is the
emotional power of visual art? How is
art different from masks and artifice?
Is everyone in the movie afraid of love
up close, only being able to love from
a distance?

Unlike most movies I sit through,
The Wings of the Dove intellectually
engaged me.

Ican honestly say that The Wings
of the Dove is the best movie I have
seen in recent memory, and I would
not be at all surprised if the film wins
a few Academy Awards. Grade: A+
