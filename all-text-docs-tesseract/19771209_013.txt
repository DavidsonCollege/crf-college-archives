The Davidsonian

“Vie for

to understand, respect,.and
enforce the system in order to
enjoy it.

Mary May Oliver

Why are you at Davidson?
What makes this place uni-
que? When you went home for
Thanksgiving, what were your
friends’ reactions to unlocked
doors and self scheduled ex-
ams?

Most of my friends were
envious. Why is this so? It is
because we have the Honor
Code and it works. Pople trust
people. This is a rare state of
affairs in our society today.

My hope is that by being
elected to the Hearing Com-
mitte, I can help to see that
these high ideals are upheld so
we can keep the freedoms we
enjoy.

Coming from a large public
high school hds broadened my
knowledge of different kinds of
people. I think I can be
objective yet sympathetic
when dealing with others.

Betsy Thomas

The Honor Code means more

than self-scheduled exams; it
means a special attitude at
Davidson. A trust between
students and faculty which
makes Davidson distirictive, a
trust worth keeping.

Susan Eglin

Twoof the great aspects of
Davidson, the Honor Code
and the Code of Responsibility

demand a Hearing Committee.

whose members display inte-
grity and open-mindedness. In
addition, a member must be
able to judge his peers fairly.
I believe I can be a good

member of this committee for
the next three years. I
hope that as you consider all
the candidates, you will find
me worthy of your support.

Karen Hester

I am running for one of the
three places that a rising
sophomore can hold on the
Hearing Committee. The com-
ittee decides whether or not a
student is guilty of breaking
the Honor Code.

I believe I can make the
rational judgments this posit-
ion requires. I have the time
and energy to do an effective
job and would appreciate your
support.

Please give me your serious
consideration for a place on
our Honor Court Hearing
Committee. I would like to be
able to use my energy to
strenghen and further develop
the Honor System atDavidson
as well as perform the tradit-
ional duties as a member of the
hearing Committee.

The Honor Code was a
major attraction ot Wavidson
while I was choosing a college,
and its reputation is some-
thing to be proud of.

My respect for the system
even before I chose to be a
student here has caused me to
.. ant to work towards preserv-
ing the system for the time
that I will be at Davidson as
well as for its future. Thank
you for your consideration.

Greg Burnard

Personally, I view a position
on the Hearing Committe as
an experience through which I
can learn. I feel that such a
unique position enlarges the
individual’s knowledge of him-
self by forcing him to examine
his own values and thereby,
hopefully, to emerge with a
clearer view of. them.

I also feel, however, that I
can offer something in return:
the experience from two years’
service on my high school’s
hearing committee. It is for
these reasons that I seek office
on the committee.

Rob Fields

Our Honor Code is a force
that is with us every minute of
every day that we spend here

at __ Davidson.

It isa positive force which
allows us much freedom -- we
can schedule exams at our own
convenience; we can enjoy
the benefits of an open stack
library; we can leave our dorm
rooms unlocked without undue
concern; we can eat at Slater

when we forget our ID’s; we

can cash checks at Seven-E]-
even with only our Davidson

ID’s.

We are trusted. This

freedom is due entirely to the
consideration of others which
our Honor Code prompts us to
exhibit.

I strongly believe in our
Honor Code, and I would like
to have a chance to see that it
continues to work.

For this reason, I am
running for one of the fresh-
man (rising-sophomore) pos-
itions on the Hearing Com-
mittee.

The priviledges that we
enjoy should not be taken
lightly. One of Davidson’s
most attractive reatures is its
Honor Code. The job of the
Hearing €0mmittee is to insure
that the Honor Code remains
strong and functioning.

I wish to serve you as a
member of the hearing commi-
ttee. I know this is a respon-
sible and difficult position
because I served on a similar
committee in high school.

I sincerely hope though,
that the Hearing committee
will not have the need to meet
very often. I would appreciate
your vote on December 13.

Vincent Long

I see the election of hearing

committee members as essent-
ially choosing the people that
the students want to judge
their honor violation cases.
Members should be those
that can listen  obje
ctively and fairly, but are
willing to enforce the provis-
ions of the honor code as
necessary.

I. entered this race
because I am_ genuinely
interested in maintaining the
fine Davidson tradition of the
honor code, and I would like to
take an active role in the honor
system.

I feel that I will be able, if
elected, to fulfill the requirem-
ents as I have stated them

above, and I would appreciate —

your vote.

Lindsay Robertson

My own experience in acting —

as judge includes serving as a
member of our high school’s
disciplinary board and acting
as a camp counselor. In both
capacities, especially the for-
mer, I had to make the
inevitable decision: which

comes first,. one’s friends ,and
popularity, or one’s conscience
This decision is extremely
difficult and I do not envy
those who have not, in their
minds, made it.

For what its worth, I think I
could do a good job. But I
hope you'll decide for yourself
just how ‘‘fresh’’ We as candi-
dates are. Read the literature
given out, but, more impor-
tantly, get around to talk with
your candidates. My door, for
one, is always open.

John Thomson
The Student Hearing Com-
mittee is the body that is re-
sponsible for maintaining the
integrity and effectiveness of
the Honor Code.

The advantages of the code,
such as self-scheduled exams
and unlocked doors, are far too
valuable to lose. The only way
to preserve these priviledges is
to insure that all students
abide by the Code.

However, it is also
important that the Code is
fairly administered to all stud-
ents. There are numerous deg-
rees of severity in violations of
the Honor Code, and there are
few cut and dried alternatives
as to what actions should be
pursued.

Only common sense and a
good understanding of the
Honor Code can produce just
decisions. I believe I have the
judgement and knowledge too
make this decisions, and I
would appreciate your support

next Tuesday.

Julie Webber

At Davidson, the Honor

Code is more than a simple

statement. Here, the Honor

System is an active, integral

part of student life.
I wish to perpetuate this

unique open atmosphere for
future Davidson students to
experience also. What we are
living in is an environment of
trust, safety, and freedom.

It is important to me, as a
candidate for the Student
Hearing Committee, and it
should be important to you
that people genuinely conc-
erned in upholding the Honor
Code are elected to the Hear-
ing Committee.

Therefore, being a
concerned student, I feel that
I am able to uphold these

standards which constitue

Davidson life.

Guy Winkler

The Honor Code is one of
Davidson’s most distinctive
features. If for any reason we
should lose the privilege of the
Honor Code System, I think
it is obvious that not only
would our academic burdens
increase, but also we would
lose our academic burdens
lose the trusting atmosphere
of Davidson.

The Hearing Committee
insures that this will not
happen. Violations of the
Honor Code must be punished
it is the duty of the Hearing
Committee to determine what
that punishment should be.
These are my opinions. If you
,share them, I would appreci-
“ate your vote on Tuesday.
