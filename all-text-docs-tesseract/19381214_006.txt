LIBRARY NOTES
Heretofore the college library
has followed the policy used in

many schools of requiring a de-
posit on all books taken out over
the holidays, This year the library
is experimenting with the idea of
doing away with the deposit and
trusting the student to make any
replacements of lost or abused
books without requiring a guaran-
tee in advance.

MORE PLEASURE

All through the year

At Christmas time send these plea-
sure-giving cartons of Chesterfields—
packaged in gay holiday colors—wel-
comed by smokers everywhere.

You'll find Chesterfields a better ciga-
rette because of what they give you—more
smoking pleasure than any cigarette you
ever tried—the right combination of mild
ripe home-grown and aromatic Turkish
tobaccos rolled in pure cigarette paper.
