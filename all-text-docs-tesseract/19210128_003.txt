hard to beat @ praying team.”

“You can’t measure manhood
with a tape around the biceps.”

BOB MILES TO SPEAK
HERE NEXT SUNDAY

“Bob” Miles, last year’s “Y” secretary
will speak to the stndents next Sun-
day. All those who have known any-
thing of the coliege in the last two
years will remember Mr. Miles as the
man who put the Davidson “Y" on a
working basis. He was also one of the
prime movers in the Greater Davidson
Club and a valued assistant in the bas-
ketball coaching.

Mr. Miles was one of the leading men
in his class here and would have grad-
vated with high honors except that an
accident on the football ficld crushed
his leg and forced him to leave school
in his senior year. He went on through
Union Seminary and entered the Y. M.
C. A. during the war, going to France

Will Have Fifteen Delegates at the
State Convention.

The Volunteer Band met last Wednes-
day evening and elected officers for the
new term. J. P. Price succeeded Dave
Roberts as presitent. J. M. Richards
was elected vice-president and Rolston
Bitzer, secretary and treasurer.

It is the plan of the band, this year,
to have every one of its members en-
gaged in some kind of active Christian
work. Some members will go on dep-
utation trips to points in North Caro-
lina. This deputation work will be one
of the most important aims of the band
this year. Furthermore, every member

Wallace Reid as “The Dancing Fool"
and as the partner in his uncle’s ancient
jug factory proves clearly that he can
sell jugs ali day and dance all night
making a wonderful success along both
lines.

As Sylvester Tribble, a poor country
boy he undertakes to clean out the dust
of ages from his uncle's office and to
introduce modern business methods,
thus putting the factory on a firm work-
ing basis. Inspired by a dream he
makes up the advertisement “B' Jones,
B’ jugs,” puts this in a periodical and
goes out on the road to gather a pile of
orders. He returns with orders just in
time to prevent his uncle from selling
out to a competitor with whom Sylves-
ter became acquainted in the fashion-
