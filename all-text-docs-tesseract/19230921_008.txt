THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 21, 1923

Attractiveness of Rome and London
Are Most Impressive to Dr. McConnell

Professor of History, With Family,
Visits England, France and
Belgium

Dr. J. M. McConnell, who with Mrs.
McConnell and young son, John D.,
has just returned from a summer's trip
through Europe, pronounces the vaca-
tion period full of interest but especi-
ally manifests surprise at the progress
that is being made in the way of resto-
ration through the. war devastated
areas of France and Belgium.

Dr. McConnell’s itinerary included
England, France, Belgium, Switzerland
and Italy. The principal cities visited
were London, Paris, Brussels, Genoa,
Venice, Florence and Rome. He was
particularly interested in places of his-
torical interest and in England. They
visited the battlefields of Verdun and
St. Mihiel. Most of the towns in the
war zone have been restored, but Ver-
dun is being kept as it was at the close
of the war as a memorial. Some of the
principal battlefields are being made
into memorial parks, but for the most
part the effects of the war are being
rapidly effaced.

“The economic conditions are for
the most part very good. Switzerland,”
says Dr. McConnell, “is having a hard
time on account of the fact that there
are no Russian, German or Austrian
tourists. They were formerly. quite
dependent upon these. Now, however,
they are entirely dependent upon the
American and English tourists for a
living. Prices are consequently quite
high there. In France prices are lower
than in any of the other countinental
countries,”

The crops in France this year are
particularly good. The wheat crop this
vear is sufficient to supply the entire
country, Dr. McConnell says that the
French are determined to stay in the
Ruhr, and Belgium and Italy are back
of them. The English, however, are
divided on the Ruhr question.

While in Italy their party spent
some days in Rome. Dr. McConnell
says that of all the cities he visited,

Rome and London interested him most.
They went through St. Peters, the Sis-
tine Chapel, and visited the other show ,
places of the city. The radicals have
lost out in Italy and affairs are entirely
in the hands of the Fascitti, which is

composed mainly of the young men,| North Barracks—Price, P. B.,

Dr. McConnell says that of all the
cathedrals he visited, Milan was by far
the most beautiful. He says that the
Italian lakes are comparable in their
beauty to those of Switzerland. Also
the resources of northern Italy are
greater and the country is more pros-
perous than he had supposed.

From Italy the McConnells’ party
went to Itngland, where they spent 10
days in the southern and central part,
devoting several days to London,
While there they visited Stratford-on-
Avon, the home of Shakespeare. They
say that two of the most interesting
places to be visited in London are
Westminster Abbey and the Tower.
The English people are working hard
to recover from the effects of the war.
One can see on every hand that they
have been through a great tribulation.
Every village has in its center a monu-
ment erected to those who lost their
lives in the war. .\ great number of
women are working, but in spite of the
fact that so many of the people are
hard at work there are still some signs
of unemployment.

Dr. McConnell says that there is lit-
tle sympathy for Russia throughout
Europe, and opinions differ as to the
condition of Germany. The McCon-
nells did not go to Germany. They
say that there was a large number of
American college professors touring
Europe the past summer. It seems
that most of the leading colleges and
universities are giving their professors
a leave of absence, on either full or
part pay, amounting to six months or
a year, to be spent in Europe. Dr. and
Mrs. McConnell went over and back on
U. S. Shipping Board ships. They re-
port that the service is delightful.

HOUSE COMMITTEES WILL BE
| - ORGANIZED

“Towards -the-close of last year it
*-was brought to the attention of the
sstudent body that some organization
ishould be created in order to help
‘évery member-of the student body and

‘floor,
‘Third floor, Patterson, P. M., 304 E.;

to remedy many inconveniences and

troubles that occur so often in the dor- |

mitories.

It is the earnest desire of those who
are organizing ‘this house committee
that every man will understand that
this committee is for service and in or-
der to make it an effective organization
it must be used by the student body.

As stated above, this house commit-
tee originated last year and was
brought before the student body, and
there were explained some of the prac-
tical ways in which this committee was
to be a benefit. It will function as a
body to whom complaints can be made
and who are responsible for the condi-
tion of the dormitories, such as the
wash rooms, lack of hot water and
duties of the janitors. Provision will
be made for any superfluous noise that
takes place in the halls, including play-
ing of musical instruments at the. im-
proper time.

This committee also hopes to be a
help to the Court of Control by seeing
to it that certain Freshman regulations
are carried out on each floor.

It is the sincere hope that the student
body will make use of this committee
because it is for service and for the
purpose of making more pleasant the
living of every man here. The com-
mittee appointed is as follows:

Rumple—East side, Blue, R. E., 7

RICHARDSON FIELD

(Continued from page 1)
and south as did the
field. This field also is unfinished,
so the details of construction will
not appear until a later date, but
even now it is not hard to see that
when finished, it will be one of the
finest football fields to be found any-
where,

Around the basball diamond and
the varsity football field runs the
new quarter-mile track. The new
cinder path has a solid foundation of
brick from the ruins of historic old
Chambers on top of which is put a
layer of unsifted cinders. It is sur-
faced with a hard packed layer of
sifted cinders and sand. The track
Was excavated to a depth of about
two feet and each layer thoroughly
rolled as it was put down. In width
the track is large enough for five
men to run abreast. The straight
away will be directly in front of the
stands.

To the east of the cinder path and
its included areas is the utility foot-
hall field. In construction and gen-
eral appearance practically the same
as the varsity field.

On the western side of the enclos-
ure will be built a large modern
grandstand of concrete and _ steel.
The size and seating capacity of the
.stand has not been determined but

old grandstand. The plan is to con-
struct the grandstand in such a way
that it may be completed or con-
tinued at any stage. In this way
it may be built and added to until it

mand, made upon it in future years.
The main entrance to the. athletic
field will be through the center of
the grandstand. Smaller gates for
the athletes and officials will be at

it will be many times larger than the}

is large enough to satisfy any de- |

the northwest and southwest cor-
ners. A gate on the east side will
lead into the new Sprunt Field which
fis to be used by the Freshman team.

Tracks and pits for pole vault, run-
ning broad jump and high jump are
just to the south of the grandstand,
between the varsity football field
and the gate. Between the south-
ern end-of the utility field and the
fence are bases for discus, hammer,
fifty-six pound weight and javalin
;throws, and for the sixteen pound
shot put. The tackling dummies are
also located at the southern end of
the utility field. The utility field and
the section south of it are practically
complete, and it is on that field that
the Elon contest will be staged Sat-
urday. When the varsity field is
complete only the regular games |
will be played on it, all practice be- |
ing held on the utility field.

The entire Richardson Athletic
Field is underlaid with a system of
tile drains and it is estimated that
the field will be dry enough for serv: |
ice within 20 minutes after the or-|
dinary rains. : |

To the south of Richardson Ath- |
letic Field and just outside the en- |
closure, Sprunt football field is he-|
ing constructed, This field is to be}
used by Freshmen, At present it is}
in a raw, stage, grading having com-.
menced only recently. It is to run
in the same general direction as the |
other two football fields, but its |
level will be some eight or ten feet!
lower, The construction of a foot-
ball field for Freshmen became nec-
essary whén the one year rule was|
inaugurated at Davidson this fall.

On the southern side of Richard-
son Athletic Field and outside the
fence is parking space for one hun-|
dred and twenty care. A drive-way |
completely encircles the field, En-!
trance for cars is from Concord Ave-,
nue,

At present the utility field is com-
plete. Goal posts are up on both,
{football fields, but the varsity field
is not entirely surfaced. The var-
sity baseball diamond is unsurfaced
and the track is probably half laid. |
The grandstand has not yet been
started, On the other hand, Rich-,
ardson field is completely graded and
will in all probability be completed
in detail by the end of the term.

PROFUNDITY OF WISDOM PER- |
VADES THE CAMPUS |

Great events cast their shadows. be- |
, \ ees
fore them, and even now Davidson's |

‘! galaxy of illustrious post-graduates be- |

‘gins to fade into insignificance before |
the transcendent glory of the four |
mighty men who propose to “Master |
the Arts’ this year. Even now the
‘campus life feels its intellectual pulse

old athletic? vibrating from the glorious addition of|

these, whose profundity of mind is}

naire.” Perhaps in magnitude of past

only equalled by their physical grace ‘achievements, in fulness of present per-

and beauty. |
Joseph Russell Walker, that remark-
able contribution of sunny Tennessee, |
whose presence was one unceasing
stream of blessing to the class of ’21,
is the vanguard. In sensible anticipa-
tion of the vast quantities of psychol-
ogy with which he proposes to store
his voracious brain, he has sought
physical perfection upon the gridiron,
where, in spite of frequent and pro- |
longed rides upon various “Charley
horses,” his stellar performance has
awakened widespread comment.

Yes, he’s here too—William Hiram
Sharpe, that noble product of De-)
Funiak Springs, Fla—Hiram, whose |
exquisite mastery of the written word |
together with his superbly pleasing
verbosity and vivacity have made him a
veritable tower of strength. Philoso- |
phy, science, and even Greek, having
easily succumbed before his irresistible |
onslaught during his conspicuous |
career in the past, Hiram now com-|
placently contemplates a successful as- |
sault upon Jerry's grim  stronghold— |
History.

Noble Florida, in addition to the as-,
tounding Hiram, has also sacrificed
from her lverglades another of her!
matchless sons—John Henry Davis
“Bevo.” He, naturally incited by his |
past notable conquests over college |
hears, and craving one more sparkling |
draught from the alluring fountain of |
knowledge, has chosen Biology for the |
immediate satisfaction of his insatiable, |
esthetic appetite. Great Darwin, along |
with his famous satellites, must needs |
wane before this new Star of Evolu- |
tion,

Last, but least only in the trifling
matter of physical proportions, comes |
that phenomenal gift of Arkansas—
Francis Cecil Thames. “Izzy,” after
cruelly crushing the math aspirations
of many members of the class of ’26
by his peerless and flawless insight into
the mysteries of trigonometry, heard
the insistent call of his extraordinary
cerebrum for more strenuous fields of
discovery, Finally he has condescend-
ed to consider the intricacies of chem-
istry for another year,

Herein lies the Quartette Extraordi-

fection, and in radiant promise for a
startling future, the Quartette stand
alone as “souls like, stars that dwell

apart.” Who can equal our own in-
comparable Four: Refined | Hiram,
Charming “ Bevo,"’ Sophisticated

Joseph, and Debonair “Izzy”?
