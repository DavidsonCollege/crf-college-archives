Representative Charles
Weltner of the Fifth Dis-
trict of Georgia will arrive
on campus Sunday night for |
a two-day visit.

He will lead a discussion on
politics in general after Ves-
pers and will follow the discus-
sion with his address in chapel
on Monday morning.

Weltner has not yet announc-
ed a topic, but stated that he
may use the speech that he de-
livered last Thursday at Har-| |
vard University.

He also plans to visit several |
political science classes on Mon-
day. !

Accompaning Weltner will be
his administrative assistant,
Wyche Fowler. who was a mem-
ber of the class of 1962 at Dav
idson.

Congressman Weltner is_ be-
coming the spearhead for the
so-called ‘‘new Southern moder-
ate progressivism” and a sym-
bol of the “changing climate”
of Southern politics. During his
first term. in Congress, Weltner
became the only ‘‘Deep South”
representative to vote for the
final passage of the civil rights Davidsonian Siaff Writer
bill. Davidson’s Young Repub-

Weltner was graduated from 7
Oglethorpe University and re-
ceived his LLB from Columbia
University, before settling down
to an Atlanta practice.

Weltner spoke at the Demo-
cratic convention of 1964, where
the Young Citizens for Johnson
—2,000 of them — organized the
first demonstration of the Con-
vention in his honor.

Squabble On Speaker-Ban Law

as i a

able to dominate the proceed-

ings.
In an
political

atmosphere of evident
intrigue and mounting
tension, guest speaker for the
evening, senior Jim Waldron,
presented a brief talk on ‘‘The
Gag Law."’ His announced inten-
tion was to present an argument
against the resolution passed by
the North Carolina YRC in sup-
port of the “Speaker Ban” law.

Waldron, from Decatur, Ga.,

| is a member of the student com-

mittee that is working with the

i local AAUP against the “Gag”
law.

Basing his considerations on

| federal and Supreme Court pre-
cedence, Waldron stated that the

| law represents a flagrant vio-
; lation of their fundamental right

to freedom of speech, as well as

| to the Fifth Amendment of the

Constitution, which guarantees
“freedom from self-incrimina-
tion and from persecution for
the exercise of that right.”

The law, Waldron added, is
also unconstitutional because of
its vagueness. For instance, the
speaker ban denies facilities
at state supported educational
institutions to ‘‘a known mem-
ber of the “Communist Party”
or to anyone having ‘‘Commun-
ist or subversive activities or
connections for ‘‘speaking. pur-
poses.”

Waldron asked, ‘“‘What are
‘spaking purposes?’ Does this
mean that an orchestra from
Communist Russia can perform
at the University of North Car-
Olina? Would a violation of
the law occur if the conductor
of such a group ‘spoke’ his

thanks to the audience? Also,
|| what
|| connections?’ Is subscribing to a
{ Communist magazine such a

connection?"

F:

In addition to the apparent un-
constitutionality and. vagueness
of the law, it was further ar-
gued that such legislation re-
stricts academic and _ intellec-
tual development and thus the
progress of North Carolina by
prohibiting students from direct
confrontation with ideas of Com
munism, and thus from free
consideration and discourse.

At the conclusion -of the talk
elements in the group prepared
to give their views on the adop-

tion of a resolution opposing the.

recent stand by the state YRC
convention expressing support of
the “Speaker Ban” law. The
convention action was in direct
opposition to the Collegiate
Council of the YR's which had

voiced earlier opposition to the

law.

The ‘‘moderate’’ wing intro-
duced a resolution calling for
a revocation or drastic modifi-
cation of the “Speaker Ban
Law" because of its vagueness
and its toxic effect on intellec-
tual freedom.

Some confusion resulted when
Joe Beard, a delegate to the
convention. held in Charlotte
last weekend, made an unsuc-
cessful attempt to introduce be-
fore the group an alternate pro-
posal which would contain es-
sentially the same provisions as
the resolution supported by the
**moderates.””

Factional cogs were set in
motion as notes were passed be-
tween members, and it  be-
came apparent that the ‘‘Beard-
ian" group was about to make
its bid for a minor coup d‘etat.

Edgar, who was presiding,
countered this move by refer-
ring Beard to the by-laws of the
local organization which states
that ‘‘any resolution concerning
political action must be submit-

Following this victory over the

Beard followed up with the

the evening by moving to have
the resolution held for recon-

of. the Davidson YRC
for weeks to come.

Trouble arose when the Cre-
dentials Committee introduced
a motion to refuse seats to the
Charlotte College delegation be-
cause of a discrepancy in mem-
bership rolls.

YRC President Edgar's at-
tempt to counteract the pro-
posal drew immediate disagree-
ment on the part of Beard.

The delegates, by vote of the
club, were operating under the
unit rule, whereby all five votes
allotted to the club were to be
cast in favor of the majority.
A 3-2 decision resulted in favor
of the Edgar’s proposal. which
eventually was defeated 54-20.

felt that his political views
were more in line with those of
the Davidson Club than were
those of Joe Beard.”

Edgar noted that further dis-
cord came to the delegation’s
caucus when Beard made a mo-
tion that Edgar be ousted as
president of the delegation. This
motion was defeated by a vote
of 3-2, but the rift was just
beginning.

The prime point of dispute
arose from the constitutional

At the present time, the Stu-

“‘Speaker-Ban"” law. to be pre-
sented to the State Student Leg-
islature next week. Members of
the Committee preparing the
resolution are Jim Waldron, Cal
