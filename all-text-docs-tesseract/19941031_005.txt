Every Tuesday night, twenty-
one-year-olds have something to
look forward to: twenty-one-year-
old night in the 900 Room of the
Union. °

This night can provide a re-
laxing environment very different
from the normal court party.

Twenty-One- Year-Old Night

Twenty-one-year-old night pro-
duces a setting where alcohol can
be used as a enhancement and not
as a focal point.

Students, staff, acully, and
former faculty members come to
the Union on Tuesday nights from
10:30 to 1:00. These 21-year-olds
can sample beer from around the

world in bottles, a domestic beer
on tap, or the free soda and pop-
corn which is always supplied.
People often play games of spades
or hearts or simply sit around and
talk to each other.

Senior Jamal Jones believes
that 21-year-old night produces a
“quiet laid back atmosphere, which

Several Davidson enjoys enjoy having a few beers and chatting with their friends in the relaxed
atmosphere created by twenty-one-year-old night, held every Tuesday in the 900 Room.

The Davidsonian explores the history and the mystique

is not centered exclusively around
alcohol.” Senior Eleanor Hatcher
says that the event “improves [her]
quality of life.”

The History

The 900 Room bar had been
open six nights a week when the
legal drinking age was still 18.
The drinking age was first changed
to 19in 1983, and William Brown,
Union Director, had to change the
tules to fit the laws of the state.

Pitchers of beer were not al-
lowed on the table once the drink-
ing age went up to 19, but people
under 19 were still allowed in the
900 room. By the fall of 1986, the
drinking age had gone up again to
21, which forced the Union to
change its rules again.

The Union decided to wait
until the second semester, the
spring of 1987, to unveil the 21-
year-old night, because Brown did
not know if there would be enough
people of age in the fall.

Until three years ago, the
Union held just two 21-year-old
nights in the fall, because Brown
did not know if there were enough
people to support the event, and he
wanted to make it special. How-
ever, the success of the nightcaused
the Union to change to every Tues-.
day night.

The Reaction

Brown found success imme-
diately because the Senior class

“enjoyed being together for the
first time since freshman year.”
Senior Ashley Atkins says that
she likes 21-year-old night “be-
cause it is mostly a bunch of
seniors.” :

Brown takes extreme pride

in this night because of the “em-
phasis on conversation.” How-
ever, he was disappointed that
the night had to be restricted,
because it had belonged to ev-
eryone before the laws changed.
Thus, he decided that no student
activity tax could be spent at 21-
year-old night because not ev-
eryone would have the opportu-
nity to enjoy it.

When asked if he has ever
gotten a negative reaction by
teachers or administration to the
night, Brown responds, “No.”
He believes this is because there
night has a definite starting and
ending time and is totally within
the law.

Brown says he would love
to provide this atmosphere for
students under 21, but he is un-
able to do this. He will continue
to look for a way this atmo-
sphere could be repeated for the
under-21 crowd.

Rosie Molinary, an under-
21 student, feels that going to
21-year-old night is the “coming |

of age of a Davidson College
student.”

Focus on concentrations: Applied math, ethnic studies, and gender studies

By Beth Lindsey
Continued from last week.
Applied Mathematics

The applied mathematics con-
centration incorporates the math,
physics, psychology, chemistry,
economics, and anthropology de-
partments under one study. Stu-
dents have the option of selecting
the natural science track or social
science track.

This concentration was a
brainstorm of the math department
as a whole. “I was asked to come
up with a concentration in com-
puter science, but I really felt that
it couldn’t be done at that time. I
could, however, structure an ap-
plied mathematics concentration
centering on math and econom-
ics,” says Dr. Stephen Davis.

The first graduating class with
concentrators in applied mathemat-
ics was the class of 1991, which
had two participants. The program
has experienced steady growneach
year, with ten or 11° graduating
concentrators this year. “There is
pretty much an even split between
the two tracks,” says Davis. “The
majority of participants are eco-
nomics majors; however, we have
some in chemistry, physics, math,
history, and philosophy also.”

“Besides the fact that some
feel it really helps them in the job
market or when applying to gradu-
ate school, I feel that it is healthier
to have a greater understanding of
math in respect to society, and this
concentration certainly provides
for this,” says Davis.

Applications must be submit-
ted in written form to the Applied

Mathematics Advisory Commit-
tee by the last class day of the fall
semester of the junior year. For
more information on this concen-
tration, contact Dr. Stephen Davis.
Ethnic Studies
As the newest concentration
at Davidson—approved in April
1994—the ethnic studies concen-
tration is in its first year. It was
formed upon the expressed inter-
est of the faculty, students, and
Board of Trustees. Dr. Nancy
Fairley was hired to aid in the
formulation of this area of study.
Says Fairley, “The concentra-
tion seeks to help students under-
stand the contributions of the three
particular groups—African-
Americans, Native Americans, and
Latinos—both as integral groups
and also as culturally distinct.
Though we cannot guarantee to
teach sensitivity to students, we
can guarantee to introduce the criti-
cal thinking skills necessary to
understand and evaluate issues of
democracy and cultural pluralism.”
Fairley stresses the compara-
tive study of ethnicity in this pro-
gram as a necessary part of under-
standing the entire human experi-
ence. Its importance to education
today lies in the issue of diversity
being continuously raised. “Itis so
beneficial to have an academic cur-
riculum inclusive of minority con-
tributions and social issues that
impact their lives. With the oppor-
tunity to study various segments of
society comes the opportunity to
learn about diversity as a whole.”
There are currently five stu-
dents who have expressed an inter-

est in the program, with one stu-
dent majoring in Ethnic Studies
through the Center for Interdisci-
plinary Studies. Applications must
be turned in by the last day of the
fall semester of the junior year,
while any questions can be taken
to Dr. Nancy Fairley.
. Gender Studies

The gender studies concen-
tration, begun in 1989, was initi-
ated by Dr. Mary Thornberry of
the political science department,

‘Dr. Sally McMillen of the history

department, and Dr. Elizabeth
Mills of the English department.
Despite the large number of

‘female participants, Mills says,

“We strongly encourage males to
participate in the program because
the study is really on gender—
both male and female. There are a
good number of male faculty in-
volved in the program, also.”

The program as a whole has
experienced both an increased
number of participants each year
as well as an increased number of
courses offered. There are 11 par-
ticipants in this year’s graduating
class ranging in majors from his-
tory, psychology, English, and an-
thropology to economics, political
science, and philosophy.

Mills says the concentration

“is a signal to people beyond the .

school that students really had done
aconcentrated study ina particular
area. Many of our students have
moved onto further women’s stud-
ies. One has a graduate assistant-
ship at the UNC-Greensboro while
another has a teaching assistant
position atthe UNC-Chapel Hill—

both emphasizing women’s issues
in theirstudies. Yet another former
gender studies concentrator here at
Davidson is studying at the Uni-
versity of Maryland and is inter-
ested in the area of women and

law.”

Applications for this concen-
tration need to be submitted by the

‘last day of the fall semester of the

junior year. Any questions can be
directed to Dr. Elizabeth Mills of
the English department.

northern boundary of the college
along the current Main Street. At
this time each faculty member was
givena freé burial plot as a perk for
teaching. The cemetery was con-
sidered a burying ground for the
public as well.

In 1913 Davidson College
President Martin suggested that the
burial lots be sold and the income
used for the maintenance of the
burial grounds. These lots went
for $1 to $2 per foot. After half an
hour, the school had sold over
$1000 worth of lots. .

In 1962 an endowment was
raised for the cemetery as a result
of the poor upkeep of the area.

Who lies in the cemetery?

The cemetery is the resting
place for nine mayors of the town
of Davidson, ten Davidson Col-
lege presidents and their children
who died while they were in of-
fice, and 12 Davidson College stu-
dents.

Twenty-nine of those buried
in the cemetery..were Civil-War
soldiers, and one soldier fought in
the Spanish-American War. Dur-
ing war times many men were bur-
ied in the Davidson College cem-
etery because there was no way to

ship the corpses to their homes; at
this time the railroad system had
not reached Davidson.

Stories of the Dead

Walter Lee Lingle, 1868-1956,
was the eleventh president of
Davidson College. Although his
presidency coincided with the
Great Depression, his tenure
marked a period of significant
growth for the college. He helped
found Preyer Infirmary, Duke
Dorm, and Grey Library.

Andrew Goetchius and a
group of fellow students decided
to go skating on a pond near
Davidson in January of 1894.
Goetchius ran upstairs to get his
skates. While coming down the
stairs, he fell over the railing to the
floor below. He died two days
later.

David Yonan, class of 1900,
was a Davidson student from Per-
sia. He drowned in the Catawba
River while attempting to rescue
others who had swum too far out.

William P. Williams became
the first mayor of Davidson in 1879.
At that time, the town was.called
Davidson College.

Within ten days Williams
changed the name of the town from
Davidson College to —.
to Davidson.
