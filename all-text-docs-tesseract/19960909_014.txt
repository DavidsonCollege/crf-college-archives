Bad
signs

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

How times have changed.

Last year the men's basket-
ball team recruited a team man-
ager by putting up signs around
campus. The big perk was a free
trip to atournament in Las Vegas
over Christmas Break.

This year’s team has posted
similar signs directed at poten-
tial players. This year’s exotic
holiday extravagnza: Puerto
Rico, where the ‘Cats will face
UMass.

Speaking of bad signs, dol-
lar signs are becoming an in-
creasingly prevalent, if not domi-
nant presence in sports at all lev-
els.

This recent stadium-renam-
ing binge has risen to riduculous
heights. Whatever happened to
Ye Olde Days when stadiums
were just named for its team or
city?

Now we have 3Com Park
instead of Candlestick in San
Francisco. Continental Airlines
Arena instead of Brendan Byrne

Arena in New Jersey’s Meadow-
lands.

And just a few weeks ago,
Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami,
home of baseball’s Marlins and
football’s Dolphins, was renamed
Pro Player Park. Pro Player is a
branch of Fruit of the Loom.

Underwear.

But this is the worst. Start-
ing in 1998, the University of
Louisville’s football field will
cease to be Cardinal Stadium. It
will instead be - brace yourself -
Papa John’s Park.

Yup. Like the pizza.

_ What’s next? Belk Arenaas
Subway Center or Domino’s
Arena? Richardson Field as Ver-
batim Field? —

Back to the basketball team.

Narcisse Ewodo, who hails
from Yaounde, Cameroon, and
is the lone senior on this year’s
team, was highlighted in an ar-
ticle in October’s College Sports
about the recent influx of inter-
national players in NCAA bas-
ketball.

You see, Cisco, whose fa-
ther is the chief of a one million-
member Cameroonian tribe, is a
prince.

This created a sticky situa-
tion last spring when the Wild-
cats recruited a member of the
same tribe, who could not look
Cisco in the eye because of his
royal standing.

opted for a school other than
Davidson.

What did His Highness
Cisco have to say about that?

“Normally, he. shouldn’t
have gone against what I said.
We'll take care of it when we get
home.”

But ultimately, the prospect }

Men’s soccer wins two in Verbatim tourney

Coach Slagle said depth was
the key to his team’s success dur-
ing this ‘96 campaign. And the
Wildcats proved that this weekend,
wearing down both Radford and
Winthrop.

On Saturday, Radford arrived
ready to play, creating several scor-
ing opportunities, but Wildcat
keeper Matt Hill played tough,
keeping Davidson tied at love at
the half.

But in the second half,
Davidson’s depth prevailed. With
7:26 left in the game, forward Rob-
ert Clarke, Davidson’s ‘95 scoring
leader, notched his first goal of the
season, breaking ascoreless tie with
a rocket off the cross-bar. He only
made it a one goal game, but
Clarke’s goal seemed to put the
Eagles away.

“We knew Radford was dying
there in the end,” Slagle said. “We
could have tacked on another goal
or two, but the one was enough.”

Even before taking the field
Sunday, Davidson’s depth took on
anew level. Citing the severe men-
tal strain of a goalkeeper, Slagle

gave sophomore Bradford Stroble
astartin the cage against Winthrop.

“Tt’s along season. Matt (Hill)
is a great goalie, and I know he’s
going to give us 17-18 games. But
like the rest of us, he needs a rest.
And with three games this week, it
seemed logical to give Stroble a
start,” Slagle explained.

Unlike Saturday, the Wildcats
jumped out early on Sunday, tak-
ing a comfortable 2-0 lead into the
half.

But Winthrop (2-1), 3-1 win-

ners over Appalachian State on

Saturday, fought back. Goals by
Scott Rawlins and Darryl Gomez,
coupled with a complacent Wild-
cat team led to overtime.

But Davidson’s fresh legs
were the keys again. Phil Julien’s
third assist of the weekend, a cross
to Jeff Harrell 2:59 into the first
overtime, gave the Wildcats their
third and decisive goal.

“Harrell’s goal was the key,”
said Slagle. “After that one went
in, we all relaxed a little bit.”
Davidson added two more goals,
including a penalty kick by Clarke,
giving the Wildcats a 5-2 victory.

The Wildcats (3-1) are com-
ing together. Slagle continues to

tinker with the line-up, but whom-
ever the starters, they are always
under a watchful eye.

“With such a deep team, sub-
stitutions can be ubiquitous,” said
Slagle. “The starters know they
have to perform because there are
lots of guys who can play lots of
positions.”

‘This depth does create prob-
lems for Slagle. He must limit the
roster to eighteen for the next
weekend’s trip to Las Vegas.

“Obviously some people will
be upset,” said Slagle. “But that
will make those guys (players who
don’t make the trip) work that much
harder.”

Harriers open their season at Blowing Rock
Deeper men’s team grabs fifth without key runners

By WiL_ BRADSHAW

In a promising first race at
App. St., the men’s cross country
team placed fifth and showed what
a luxury numbers can be.

Only eight of the team’s fif-
teen members made the trip to
Boone on Saturday, leaving harri-
ers who had been nursing injuries
behind.

“We could have run more
guys, but it made no sense to,”
coach Gary Andrew said. “I’m re-
ally excited and pleased with the
results. The guys are training hard.
We feel as soon as we get all the
guys back who didn’t run today
we’ll be much stronger and much
more competitive.”

Josh Cookson led the Wild-
cats, finishing eighth (26:40), while
freshmen William Isenhour (27:47,

21st) and Pat Burchett (28:12, 27th)
finished second and third for the
team.

Cookson’s time was the sec-
ond best ever by a Wildcat on that
course, and Isenhour’s was tenth.

Andrew was also pleased with
the performance of Keith Gordon,
a sophomore who struggled most
of last season, but finished fourth
on the team in a strong race Satur-
day (28:20, 31st).

*Tt was a really good first ef-
fort,” Cookson said. “We’re look-

_ ing to come in the top five in con-

ference. We have a really good
shot if we continue to work hard
and get everybody healthy. I think
we’ll be able to do it.”

Rick Cratsenberg, who An-
drew expects will challenge
Cookson for the top spot on the
team, Tripp Franklin, a three year
veteran, and two top freshmen

Brent Ferrell and Victor Talbird,
were among the missing runners.

“Tt’ll be interesting to see how
it (the season) shakes out,” An-
drew said. “Last year everybody

healthy ran, but this season we
have the luxury of numbers. We
have enough guys to capably fill in
when people can’t run. It’s areally
good size team right now.”

Women finish seventh

The women’s cross country
team faced Wake Forest, UNCC,
UNC-A, Duke, App. St., and
Winthrop on Saturday at the Caro-
lina Classic in Blowing Rock, N.C.

Unlike the relatively flat
courses of the past, this recently
constructed trail redefined rough
and ragged. Led by Suzy Burr and
Allie Curran, the Wildcats finished
seventh, walking away with anew
perspective and understanding of

what they need to work on.

Coach Beth Puckett was dis-
appointed in Saturday’s perfor-
mance, but still has high expecta-
tions for the year.

“The seven sophomores are
much further ahead than they were
last year,” she said. “Our goal is to
better our performance from last ©
year, by finishing a spot higher in
conference.”

This year’s conference meet
takes place at Western Carolina,
where the team will encounter simi-
lar terrain.

Davidson suffered from first game jitters, falling, 2-1, in sudden-
death overtime to Westchester College in Pennsylvania on Saturday.
The Wildcats were rained out in the second game against Ursinus
College on Sunday afternoon and came home early, missing a chance

“It was a rough and shaky start, but we’re prepared to get it
together before facing Appalachian State next week,” said goalkeeper
Sara Gebhardt, whose saves in the second half of the Westchester game
helped push the game into overtime.

Kate Schoening, freshman midfielder, scored the only Davidson
' | goal early in the first half on an unassited drive. Westchester scored
with seconds left in the first half, tying the game until the end of
regulation. Almost immediately after overtime began, Westchester

“Pennsylvania is some of the toughest country for field hockey.
We’ll come back and be ready for next week,” said Smith.

Football grabs win in scrimmage

By MICHAEL KRUSE

In a harbinger of good things
to come, Dunn Mileham's 39-yard
field goal lifted Davidson to a 24-
21 overtime victory over Division
III Schowan College in
Murfreesboro, N.C. on Aug. 31.
“TI was pleased,” said head
coach Tim Landis. “Schowan was
a very big, physical team. I’m
excited we faced a team like that.
We're going to give up size, we’re
going to give up depth. So we
needed to experience that type of
adversity.”

Landis was especially happy
with the defense, which effectively
ran the new Stunt 4-3 system.

Defensive linemen Ben
Spivey and Jay Ariail and safety
Donnie Johnson stood out indi-
vidually, according to the coach.

Offensive tackle Scott Reeder
and center Chip Stewart, quarter-
backs Tommy Dugan, Clif Henry,
and Matt Strader, wideouts Karim
Lawrence, Dan Dearing, and Mike
Harrington, and the entire backfield
performed well for the offense.

"We moved the ball consis-
tently throughout the day, but I
was hoping to open it up a little
more,” Landis said. .

Some personnel decisions
were made after the scrimmage,
but many spots will be decided this
weekas the first game, at Maryville,
approaches.
