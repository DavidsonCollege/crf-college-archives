Friday, September 20, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Test Your S.Q. In The Davidsonian’sSports Quiz

Andy Barron

For your reading entertainment, I
have included a short sports quiz. I made
the quiz rather rapidly so no one is ex-
pected to get all the answers, since many
don’t make sense. Nevertheless, here
they are.

1)Who is Nick Lowery?

2)What does Bill Elliot have to do
with cigarette prices?

3)Who is the Braves general man-
ager?

4)What do Wayne Gretzy and Jackie
Gleason have in common?

5)What sports figure has a “foul” ap-
petitite?

6)What tennis player’s sub-par play
can be attributed to “Bad News?”

7)What are the Braves paying for
Bruce Sutter’s services?

8)What do Essendon, Carleton and
Fitzroy do on television?

9)Who will pass “Bear” Bryant this
season as college football’s all-time win-
ningest coach.?

10)How much did Eric Dickerson
pay in fines for holding out of camp this
season?

Before I give the answers to the quiz,
I must give this summer’s Davidsonian
Sports Editor Awards. No summer is
complete without recognizing the many
exemplary,
achievements and antics in the world of
sports. As always, the categories change
from term to term.

Baseball Player Most Deserving of a
Lifetime Contract: Dwight Gooden,
baseball’s best player at age 20. Honora-
ble Mention: Don Mattingly.

Most Stunning Prediction For 1985-
86 NFL Season: Sports Illustrated saying
Kansas City will edge the Los Angeles
Raiders out of the play-offs.

Too Good To Be True Award: See
Most Stunning Prediction Award.

Take My Ball And Go Home Award:
The St. Louis Cardinals’ Joaquin An-
dujar for not playing in the All-Star
Game. The National League didn’t seem
to need him, though, as they embarrassed
the American Leaguers yet again.

If I Could Do It All Over Again:
Though there are many worthy candi-
dates, the Atlanta Braves win for letting
Donnie Moore go so as to buy Bruce Sut-
ter. Moore is the main reason the Califor-
nia Angels are still in the pennant race
while the cost for Sutter is, well, the an-

pathetic and ridiculous.

swer to quiz question seven. Honorable
Mention: The Braves for trading Bret
Butler for Len Barker.

Base Running Expertise: Dale Berra
of the New York Yankees wins this hands
down for following Bobby Meachem to
home plate against the White Sox. This
allowed catcher Carlton Fisk to tag both
Meachem and Berra out at home.

Most Archaic Equipment: Jimmy
Conners, who still plays with a T-2000
racquet despite the fact they are no longer
made.

Now, here are the answers you’ve
either been waiting for or have skipped
directly over to see after reading the ques-
tion.

1)The place kicker for the Kansas
City Chiefs. A tougher question would be
since when did Lowery kick 58-yard field
goals as he did against the Raiders last
Thursday.

2)Since the Winston Company gave
Mr. Elliot a $/ million bonus for, of all
things, winning a few NASCAR races,
cigarette prices just might go up. Neat,
eh? —

3)With the deals the Braves have
been cutting lately, I’d say no one. If any-
one knows of a different answer, let me
know.

4)Amazingly enough, both are
known as “The Great One.” I propose
slapshots at 50 paces to see who gets to
keep the nickname.

5)Boston Red Sox third baseman
Wade Boggs, who eats chicken every
day. It must be some time because Boggs
has baseball’s best batting average at
.368.

6)Tatum O’Neill’s sweetheart and
the world’s number one tennis player
John McEnroe. According to the mother
of a nameless Davidson student, McEn-
roe has looked too tired to play recently.
That's the breaks! —

TI'd say about 15 games.

8)Any ESPN viewer knows that they
all play Australian Rules Football. -

9)Grambling’s Eddie Robinson is
three wins away from passing Bryant’s
total of 323 career victories. Just to point
out how astronomical this total is, only 4
ten coaches have ever won 200 games.

10)Dickerson paid $47,000 for re
porting 47 days late to camp. That works
out to about, oh, $1000 a day.

How did you do? If you got all te
right, you did better than the answers,
which only got eight right. By getting all
the questions right, you out did the col-
umnist, a dubious honor at best.
