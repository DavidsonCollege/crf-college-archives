singing, and we will know that

spring has arrived. With its -

arrival, spring brings renewed
action oh the diamond, on the
oval, and on the fairway as the
Davidson Varsity baseball,
track and golf teams begin
their 1979 spring seasons.

All three teams should be
primed for action since they
have practiced and played since
the fall. The baseball team
started practice in the third
week of September and has
practiced consistently since
then. -

The track team has partici-
pated in a three-team indoor
meet this winter and has many
runners who ran on the cross-
country team in the fall. The
golf team also participated in
several tournaments in the fall.

The Wildcat baseball team
looks strong for this season,
having lost only, three seniors.
The infield has eight upper-
Sid Osborne at first base,
Blaine Sanders and Andy Ho-
say at second, Jobi Melton at
short-stop and Cam Zurbruegg,
John Haskell and Jeff Ray at
third base.

The Cats add several talented
freshmen infielders in Marc
Webster, Allen Griffin, Terry
Greiner and Diggs Bishop. At
catcher the Cats have all-Sou-
thern Conference player Bob
Lapple, a junior, who will be a

“springing” into action

sophomores Yates Sealander
and freshman Chris Norwood.
Outfielders for the Cats are
Tim McDowell in left, John
Porter in center, and Jim Rich-
ards in right. Freshman Earl

Ransom will also see some _

outfield action.

Pitching remains the big
question for the Cats this year
since the graduation of Tim
Purcell and the transfer of Bill
Duke to Clemson has left the

‘starting rotation somewhat de-

pleted. However, the Cats do
have some experience on the
mound since they are led by
four senior pitchers - starters

_ Ron Cannon and Ken Norwood,

and relievers Mike Lins and
John Madden. Also starting for
the Cats on the mound will be

Dave Tornetta and John.

Young. Sophomore Rod Han-
nah and freshman Rusty Colec-
chia will also. hurl for the Cats.
Tri-captain Tim Goodell will be
an important pinch hitter.

The Wildcat track team looks
strong this year since many of
the runners from last year’s
team (which tallied an 8-1

- record in dual meets) are return-

ing. Leading the Cats in dis-
tance races is senior Doug Horn
who is accompanied by cross-
country stars Bart Landess,
Terry Morrow and the talented
freshman John Hoots.

Dick Jones and Lance Sisco
will run hurdles and the multi-
talented Sisco also competes in
the triple jump, polevault and
decathalon. In the sprints, the
Cats are led by senior Carl

In basketball, Davidson has
labored for many years since
its last 20 victory season, but
this year the Davidson rifle
team has quietly shattered that
20 victory mark.

Last Saturday at Davidson,
the rifle team ciipped the Cita-
del, 1317-1310, to raise its
record to 26-6. Robbie Kirken-
dol'led Davidson by posting the
best score of the match—a 268
out-of a possible 300. Close
behind Kirkendol for Davidson
were John Parham with a 267,
Katherine Whitney with 266,
Craig Rice with a 260, and John
Hartman with a 256. Tom
Niblock (255), Pat Stewart, and
Louis Williams also shot for
Davidson.

Last Friday, the Davidson
wrestling team lost its last
home match of the season to

Washington and Lee by a score

_ of 36-22.

As has been the case all
season, some strong individual
performances partially offset
the loss. Kevin Spangler, Scott
Smith, captain Pat Dulany,
and Svend Pedersen all won
their matches. Steve Sellers
took a commanding lead in his
126-pound match, but, in a
bizarre turn of events, pinned
himself.

‘fhe squad travels to Hamp-

den-Sydiey. tomorrow (Friday)
for a dual meet and then to.

tri-meet. The Southern Confer-

McPhail and junior Terrazzo
Wallace. McPhail was a major
point winner for the Cats last
year until he suffered a serious
knee injury in a hurdling acci-
dent. After bouncing back from
surgery, McPhail should help
the Cats in the sprints and
relays.

In the weights, David Taylor
has been healing an injury and
will miss the first few meets,
but he hopes to come back
strong for the end of the season
to help the Cats in the discus.
Joining Taylor at the weights
are fréshmen Willie Lanier, Ray
Sinclair, and Ken Fleming.

The golf team is led by
seniors Sollie Foy, Parks Neis-
ler and Joe Davis. Junior Mark
Hess and sophomores Bill Baird
and L.D. Simmons will also
lead the Cats.

During Spring break the
team will travel to Florida to
play in the Seminole Classic in
Tallahassee. Then they will tra-
vel to Fripp Island, S.C. to play
in the Fripp Island Invitational.
During spring term the team
plans to play in four tourna-
ments - N.C. Collegiate, Elon
Invitational, Jacksonville Clas-
sic, and the Southern Confer-
ence Tourney.

Spring offers a pleasant set-
ting to enjoy one’s leisure time
outdoors, and the Cat Spring
athletic schedule should offer
plenty of exciting outdoor ac-
tion. Sudents, staff, faculty and
friends of the college are all
encouraged to support the
Wildcat baseball, track and golf
teams as they seek successful
seasons this year.
