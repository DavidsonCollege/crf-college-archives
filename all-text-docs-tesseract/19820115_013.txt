_ justia the doors a

with fish bowls on their heads-—

my store of the store—.

andl gazed at them all.

I,

by all saw ©

treageties of exery-kind

jewels from. Africa, Arabia, andall,
a ruby ring of the king of old England

black spiders, purple mice and green scorpions
who once outside =

come alive at night

and scutter across — | |

the small girl with dots for eyes—
yes, she was the smallest girl in the world

trapped
in her transparent sphere

and only I could set her
free.

real, live knives and guns

to fight off her mean old miserly uncle
who put her there and charges

folks a fee

to see her...

my small sweaty hands

groped in the bottom.

of my pockets

and they played

with the lint they found there

rolling it into balls between thumb and pointer
then, ,

elated,

I,

pulled out a coin
-and looked at it shine. :

a dime.

_ Mimi said save money,

but

a dime--- .
that’s just 2 nickels,
that’s just 10 pennies.

a treasure is so much more.

I decided,

filled his eye, -
~ turned his nose,

nothing.
I kicked it.
I jabbed it.

I reached for a second chance

and found only
fuzz balls.
