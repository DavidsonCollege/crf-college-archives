Baseball has cast its hypnotic spell over
Sprunt Athletic Field. The attention
of the entire student body is turned to
Coach Fetzer and his fifty faithful pri-
vates. From now until June the enthus-
iastic fan’s mind will follow with keen
interest the activities of the Red and
Black squad, and from all appearances
they will have plenty of thrills for their
interest.

The past few days have found the Red

and Black busy as never before getting| ,

into shape for one of the hardest 'sched-
ules she has ever had, and which begins
a little earlier than usual.

The players are in fairly good physi-
cal condition and arms have about got-
ten into whipping form. Of course the

pitchers are not putting out any smoke]

as yet, but the temperature is rising with
each succeeding day. All the new men
are having the fine points drilled into
them, and the old men are learning the

old tricks of team work more efficiently. | ,
“Coach” has a wealth of material for},

this time of season, and the prospects
are bright.

an unusual supply of fresh material.
There are three out for the catcher’s job
at present. They are: “Sam” Keesler.
Faires and Burns. Keesler is an old mar
and has had some experience. He is
little light but fast, and has a good pep
when working right. Faires, also light
has good form and a good arm. “Buck”
Burns may also be in the running, as he
is a big boy and fairly fast.

The pitching should be of a high or-
der this spring, judging from the early
workouts. Worth, Garrison and With-
ers, the three most promising among the
new material, are showing up well.
Worth has a good build, form, and plen-
tv of speed, and as soon as the weather
warms up he promises to be on the job
with the best. With some coaching
Withers and Garrison will strengthen
the staff.

“Bill” Lawson is back on the job and
going good. His work last year was of
the best quality, and this season should
be his best,

“Dutch” Hengeveld is now off the
Hill, but will be back in time to train
up for the first game. He was a main-
stay of the staff last year, and will prove
a strong asset either in the box, or, if
need be, in the outfield, this year.

All the old infield is back. in better
shape and with more experience. It looks
as if Saunders will again hold down
first. Johnson is showing up well at
second, with Black and Wood going
good at third and short. John Pharr
and J. C. Watkins also look good for
infield positions. Singleton, Safford,
Dean and Flowers, all new men, are
showing up swell.

There is a host of promising men for
the outfield, and three strong hitters are
sure to be found among the bunch.

The student body is looking forward
with much enthusiasm to the opening
game of the season with Catawha Col-
lege. which will be staged on the Hill
on the 27th of this month.

Practically all of the last}.
year letter men are back, and in addition |.

tween the two societies in Shearer Hall

debater on each side will be awarded at

is, “Resolved, That the Federal Govern-
ment should own and operate all inter-

NEW REFERENCE WORKS
IN THE LIBRARY

The following volumes have been
added to the reference department of
the college library: “A Dictionary of
Similes,” by Wilstach; “A Tennyson
Dictionary.” by Baker; “A Dictionary
of Dates;” “A Dictionary of Non-Clas-
sical Mythology :” “The New Interna.
tional Year Book;” ‘Words and
Places: and four volumes of the New
York Times Index.

Plans are being completed for the or-
ganization of an association to be known
as the North Carolina College Press
Association, which shall include — the
newspapers and magazines in the various
colleges of the State. The idea was
suggested by a member of ‘THe Davin-
SONIAN. staff at a meeting last: spring.
but it was not until this past September
that work was begun en it. During the
latter part of September coriespondence
was opened by T. J. Mitchell, who has
had the plans in charge, with the other
colleges of the State and’ the plan of the
association outlined to them. After
some delay a sufficient number of the
colleges signified their willingness to co-
operate, and arrangements were — for-
mally entered into,

The organization has for its abject the
extension of the good feeling which ex-
ists between the colleges, the drawing, of
the newspaper and magazine slaffs of the
various institutions closer together for
mutual benefit in discussing and settling
questions which so often atise in) con-
nection with these publications, the shar-
ing of plans and suggestions which have
been helpful to the various publications
either in an editorial or a financial way,
the raising of the literary standards of
the papers and magazines, and the broad-
ening of their scope and usefulness to
their respective colleges.

"The staffs of the two University pub-
lications have agreed to entertain a con-
vention of delegates from the colleges
during the month of April, at which
time the organization will be perfected,
a constitution drawn up and adopted.
officers elected, and a definite policy for-
mulated. Several of the colleges have
already elected their representatives and
notified ‘Tne Davinsonran, and the
program for the meeting is being ar-
ranged as quickly as possible. As soon
as final plans for the convention have
heen made they will be announced.

READING OF JOB GIVEN
A‘ CHURCH SUNDAY NIGHT

Instead of the regular sermon, Profes-
sor Fulbright gave a reading of the
book of Job last Sunday evening. After
making of very interesting review of the
book from a literary standpoint, he pro-
ceded to give the philosophical dialogue
which took place between Job and his
friends..

By his perfect enunciation and pleas-
ing style Professor Fulbright made the
reading very interesting and highly in-
srtuctive. The rendering of the discus-
sion in this way gave his hearers a clear-
er insight into the meaning of the book.
and, at the same time, made them realize
that such a discussion really had taken
place.
