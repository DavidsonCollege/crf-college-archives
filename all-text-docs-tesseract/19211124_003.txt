|MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS
| SECRETARY BLANK ROBERTS

| Bland Roberts, a graduate of Vander-
| bilt University and traveling secretary of
the Student Volunteer Movement, spoke
|to the Ministerial Band Sunday after-
noon on the subject “Making Christ
Real.”

Mr. Roberts emphasized the fact that
doing good is an ideal only to the philan-
thropist, while the task of making Christ
real to others is or should be the ideal
of every Christian and especially of
every minister of the Gospel.
| In order to make Christ real in one’s
[liEe, every stronghold of selfishness must
be thrown wide open and one’s whole
life and will surrendered wholly and en-
tirely to ‘God. Thi# is utterly impossi-
ble if one is to arbitrarily choose his
own field of work and give himself up
to the selfish idea that he would not be
able to serve in any other field.

God_has a plan for every man or else
He would never have made him. God
alone can tell a man just what that plan
Hence to fill the place which God
has made for an individual, that indi-
vidual must seek God’s plan for his life
without reservation as to the nature of
work which he personally would like to
de or as to the field in which he would
like to serve.

ION Ve AND ALBERT WILDMAN

ON VOLUNTEER DEPUTATION

Last Sunday J. C. Wool and A. C.

The Epworth League has full charge of
one service each month in this church,
and it was that service at which they
spoke, F. C, Sherrill, ’24, is doing some
excellent work as president of the Ep-

TWO MOVING PICTURES ARE

ON THIS WEEK’S SCHEDULE

This week two pictures are the movie
bill, “Experience” on Wednesday night,
and “After the Show” Friday night.
Both of these pictures are recent re-
leases.

“Experience” is based on George V.
Hobart’s play. Richard Barthelmess has
the star role as “Youth.” Marjorie Daw
takes the part of “Love” and Kate Bruce
plays as “Youth’s Mother.” The general
opinion of the critics seems to be that
the play might have had a better direc-
tor than Fitzmaurice.

“After the Show” is the story of two
Americans at Oxford, This play is di-
rected by William de Mille, who is a
follower of the “literal” school of di-
recting as opposed to the “immpression-
istic.” Jack Holt, Lila Lee, and Gharles
Ogle are the main actors. Many Davide]
sen students remember Ogle as_ the
cock-fighting farmer in the “Jucklins.”
shown here last spring. The story was
written by Rita Weiman, the author of
the story of “Footlights.”

sionary work in western North Caro-

DR. WRIGHT LECTURES |

(Continued from page 1) |

Can one convert a man? No, but God
converts men only through human agen-|
cies, and man’s part lies in putting him-|
self unreservedly at God’s disposal, to
be used as'an agency.

Has prayer an important part in the
winning of a man? Prayer is the Whole|
thing, not that we must top there, but!
through listening in prayer as well as
speaking, we can learn ways and means
of getting a man closer to Christ. At
this point Dr. Wright stressed forcibly |
the value of the morning watch.

Is all) this practical? Who shall be
approached? How can one be a friend
and win the lost person to Jesus Christ?
If impractical, it would not be worth
while. Approach the man or men whom
God tells you to approach. He will cer-
tainly tell one who prays earnestly in a
listening as well as speaking attitude, |
and your opportunities and usefulness
increase as you go along. Practice alone
makes perfect.

There are four ways of winning a
man: formal persuasion, direct action,
nurture, processes of friendship. The
last of these is the most useful and prac-
tical for us, there being four main proc-
esses of friendship: gift, self-revelation,
wounds of love, vicarious suffering. The
last of these never fails, but needs not to
’e used often. Wounds of love are some-
times necessary, so one should not be
afraid to lose a man’s friendship in order
to be his friend. If one reveals himself
his friend will most certainly do the
same, he will have the opportunity to
tell him of Christ in a very real way.
Forty per cent of the non-Christians of
America would be touched and won if
every Christian were absolutely gener-
ous, not nursing a bit of selfishness and
prides

But what must a man do after he is
won? He must do three things: make
full retribution for wrongs done in the
past, surrender unreservedly to Christ,
and witness for his new Master.

It is felt that through his powerful ad-
dresses during his visit to Davidson
many have become more vital powers
for Christ. From here he went to the
University of North Carolina and from
there back to Yale:

find it,” found in Matt. 10:39, was quoted,
Mr. Roberts being so recently a stu-
dent himself could’ speak as’a student to
students, and his directness and earn-
estness in presenting his subject greatly
impressed his hearers. In

closing he

quoted the following:

“If Jesus Christ is a man,
And only a man, I say |

That of all mankind I cleave to Him,
And to Him will I cleave alway.

“Jf Jesus Christ is God, |
And the only God, I swear |
I will follow Him through heaven and
hell, |

The earth, the sea, and the air,”
