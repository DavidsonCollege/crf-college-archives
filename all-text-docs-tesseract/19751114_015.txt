3-0n-3 cage tourney ends,
flickerball drifts to finals

By TOM BLACKWOOD
and KIRK COMBE

It’s all over. It came and
went. Was here and now is
gone. The 75-76, 3 on 8

tournament is at an end. Sigh.

We are only sorry that one
team had to win.

There were too many good
teams. Out of the dustcloud of
talent blew two exceptional
groups: the Dandies, and
Return to Forever, featuring
Mark Firth.

Neither team had an easy
route. The Dandies disposed

of the Hustling Spermwhales, .

PDT # 1, and the Little Big
Men in their climb.

Return to Forever clawed
through Last Chance, sorry
fellas, and the Kerwood Der-
bies. Hohum. When the smoke
cleared, it was Return to
Forever on top, 20-8.

The man-for-man play of
Firth, Ken Schmader, and
Kirk Combe made up for the
zone play of Joe Duncan. ‘“‘We
were lucky Kenny, Mark, and
I were shooting well, ’cause
Joe wasn’t worth a frog’s
leg,’’ said Combe.

' Rick Ehrhart was the Dan-
dies’ sharpshooter, followed
by Paul Henschen and the
nondescript, tall guy with the
beard. Their fourth man, Dick
Boehner played well in spurts.

' But the essence of any 3-on3
tournament, as you well know,
is not the strained ankles and
tempers of play, but the
nomenclature of the various
teams.

For instance, do you sup-
pose the NBA would ever field
a team called ‘‘Vas Deferns”’

or ‘‘We're terrible’? Of course

not; don’t be stupid.

What city, with the possible
exception of Cleveland, would
associate its fair name with
“The Hustlin’ Sperm
Whales,” ‘“‘Raoul and Various
Poor Devils,’’ ‘‘Ma Forbes and
the DWB,” ‘Fruit Hill

Gang,” “Little Black Sambo
and His Poor White Trash,”
“The Brown Dirt Cowboys?”

Displaying their usual Cle-
velandish mentality, the frat-
ernities and freshmen came up
with their usual plentitude of
originality by coming up with
"ee OL, Oo ORACES,” ond
Cannon #2,” or “4th Richard-
son #7.”

Also, a clever group of
youths conspired to name
their team ‘‘bye’’ and ad-
vanced to the quarter-finals
before any opposing team
showed up for a game.

As the regular season ends
with a groan, it is flickerball
tournament time once again.
Some diehards have been
writing home to brag of dual
sport stature. How silly.

In exciting tournament
openers, 4th Richardson out-

classed Pika in overtime by
yardage. In more exciting
tournament play IFT cruised
by the Bongs, yes the Bongs,
25-19. The epitome of flicker-
ball was attained as a touch-
down was scored by each team
in the last two minutes. Not
succumbing to the cosmic
pressures IFT scored the
winning touchdown with less
than 11 seconds (or was it 417)
left to play.
In more exciting post-
season tournament play SAE
defeated the Pat’s Dirty Old
Men, 26-0. In further tour-
nament action Off Again em-
baressed Emanon, 20-0.

Reflecting on it all, the tired
but frank Sterling Martin told
these reporters, “You know,
it’s too bad Pat’s Dirty Old
Men didn’t get a chance to
beat ‘Off Again’.”’

Weight room controversy flares up

By DAVE KELLER
Staff Writer

There has been a slight
controversy this year over the
removal of the barbells from
the weight room by the foot-
ball team.

A number of student users
of the weights have questioned
the team’s right to use the
weights solely for its mem-
bers.

There now appears to be no
question as to who has control
of these particular weights
because, according to several
athletic department sources,
they were bought a number of
years ago by the football team
with football funds and were
moved both to be more con-
venient for the football team.

Their removal, said Assist-
ant Athletic Director Tom
Couch, “‘was also based on the
fact that we are trying to turn
the open space under the west

grandstands into a permanent
college weight room, and we
felt that at the present our
Universal weight machine
could meet the needs of the
student body.’’

“We have already received
donations of mirrors and car-
pet for the room,’’ Couch
noted. ‘‘Now we are just
waiting on enough money so
that we are able to do a good
job on it.”

He also said that if a

student wanted to use the
barbells rather than the mach-
ine he could get a key (the
barbells are locked up to
prevent their theft) from one
of the football coaches, pro-
vided the student did not work
out alone.

After construction of the
new weight room, the present
one will be converted into a
small gym for women’s gym-
nastics and tumbling classes;
such a facility would fill quite

a void in the college’s athletic
department.

“The basketball team needs
to use the weight room as part
of our practice,”’ said Assist-
ant Basketball Coach Harry
Krohn, “‘and we need to have
it for our use only for about
twenty minutes each day. We
plan to be in there from 5 to
5:30 every afternoon but Mon-
day. Students should take
note of this and plan their

workouts accordingly.’”’
