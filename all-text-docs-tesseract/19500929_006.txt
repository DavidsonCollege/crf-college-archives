In times like these, far-
} sighted people naturally
buy the best. And when it
comes to tires, they buy
the best tires. That’s why
more car owners today are
turning to Goodyear tires.
That’s why we're having a hard time keeping
Goodyear tires in stock — despite the fact that
Goodyear makes more tires than any other manu-
facturer in the world. Even if we are temporarily
out of your tire size, it will pay you to place your
order now for earliest possible delivery./

‘Trade new miles for old

‘90%. Dehn natin ences th
tire life. Why take chances with worn, smooth
tires? We'll trade new Goodyear miles for the
remaining unsafe mileage in your present fires.
Get out of the “ zone’’—— go Goodyear. |
And for safer driving, get LifeGuard Safety Tubes.

|

Remember, if we don’t have
your tire size today, it will
pay you to wait for new Good-
years — the best!
