Blood Drive [Sunrise Service {Stat Plans [Board Picks Hobson, Robinson As

Donations Top Set For Easter

900 Pint Mark

Coming close to its last year
record of 500 pints, the two-day
blood drive on Wednesday and
Thursday finished by having
marked up 488 pints.

In the words of Lt. Col. Bal-
lard, however, “The goal was tech-
nically reached,” as there will be
the donations by the tennis and
track teams in the near future.
These two groups were prohibited
from giving blood at this time be-
cause of the nearness of meets in
the tavo sports.

In a statement that was given
just after tho close of the drive,
Colonel Ballard, director of the
semi-annual event, said “I was
pleased at the response, al-
though I had hoped to do a
little better.”

He also stated, “I wish to ex-
press the appreciation of the
ROTC and to thank the student
body for their generous support in
donating blood and in solicitations.
In the latter ODK and IFC had
such a large part that they deserve
special commendation.”

The Pi Kappa Alpha and Pi
Kappa Phi social fraternities
gave one hundred per cent
when donating in their respec-
tive groups.

Mrs. Synder, head nurse with the
Red Cross, had this word of com-
ment on the participation of the
Davidson students: “The spirit that
has been shown by Davidson at this
blood drive is the highest that
could be hoped for.”

She also said that in the near
future, because of some student re-
quests, she would be certain to as-
sign only the prettiest and most
unmarried nurses to serve at the
Davidson drives.

Much praise was accorded Col.
Ballard himself for his ingenuity
and overall leadership displayed
during the drive buildup.

Foolies Features
Grad Gagster Act

Bill Scruggs and McNeil Upchurch will be featured in the
annual ‘‘D’ Club Foolies to be presented next Friday night

at 7:30 o'clock.

These two old Davidsonians, who
only a few years ago were head
cheerleaders and leading cut-ups on
the campus, will be the main fea-
ture of the program to be staged

in Chambers at a cost of 35 cents |!
per stag and 50 cents per couple. |;

In the immediate post-war
years of a student body dotted
with veterans, Scruggs ‘n Up-
church was a houschold word
at Davidson representative of
college life at its zanieat.

Now respectable, settled, and

They cut the act out not too
long ago because it was de-
manding too much of their
time. But they couldn’t re-
fuse to-play at Chambers one
more time, for old time's sake.

Rolling For
Spring Voting

Student Body President Mac
McLean today reported that
machinery will start rolling for
the spring elections of officers
to lead Davidson student affairs
next year. Nominations will be
heard from the floor for presi-
dent, vice president and treasurer
at chapel Monday.

An important step will be the
voting on certain proposed amend-
ments listed for the students last
week. These are concerned with
compelling all of the top five can-
didates for student wvody and
YMCA president to give a short
“campaign” speech.

Publications Editors

The other point covered by the
proposed amendments is in refer-
ence to the nomination of editors
for the various publications.

There are to be three candidates
for each editorship from each of
the staffs. Additional candidates
may be nominated from the floor
and all will have to give a short
“campaign” speech also.

Elections Board Named

Noteworthy action was seen in
the appointment of representatives
from all social fraternities, inde-
pendents and the Student Council
to the elections board. These men
have the responsibility of main-

Kirk Oglesby was elected to head
the election board. Kirk is the rep-
resentative from Kappa Sigma.

It is thought that unusual stu-
dent interest will center around the
polling places this year in light of

Heavier Voting Expected
Despite many groanings in the
past a relatively light vote is seen

Plan Communion
Before Vespers

The Westminster Fellowship will
sponsor a Communion service Sun-
day night open to the student body
at 6:30 p.m., preceding the Easter
vesper service. Dr, Cart R. Pritch-
ctt, pastor of the College Church,
will serve the communicants in the
Quadwrangler’s room on the third
floor of Chambers building.

George Knight, president of

Westminster Fellowship, and

Bob Dunbar will lead part of

the worship.

“Since the vesper committee does
not plan to have a communion
service this year, Knight said, “the
Westminster Fellowship is provid-
ing this opportunity for the student
body as a union to worship around
the Lord's table and partake of the
sacrament as He has ordained.”

Prof. Johnston

out and test 15 new men were
extended membership into David-

Dr. Johnston showed how
Trotsky had the task of un-
doing all of his prior anti-
army propaganda and ‘recon-
structing an armed force from
a peychologically demoralized
group of soldiers.

A difference of opinion as to what

should be the basic structure of
the army ended by Stalin’s taking
over the still shakily organized
force. '
It. was his plan to build the
army as a series of militia, He
maintained control of this force by
interspersing the troops with gov-
ernment spies.

This was the first year that
pledges of the Davidson com-
pany had to study background
information of Scabbard and
Blade and to contribute any
physical labor. Main project for

tion for federal inspection.

dy Lamon, Alex Hodgin, Preston

College Salts Out
Before They're In

All but one of the Davidson students who were recently
calfed to active duty from the Naval Reserve have received can-

cellations to their orders.

All but one of the Davidson stu-
dents who were recently called to
active duty from the Naval Reserve
have received cancellations to their
orders.

Adrian Bowen is the only man
who has not received the notifica-
tion of his change of status and he
believes that too will be forth-
coming.

Those who are affected are
Bill Bristow, Jim Moore, Phil
Hammond, Dave Freeman,
Marshall James, Victor Taylor
and Parks Dalton.

The surprise arrival of the can-
cellations from the Navy came on

the heels of the news that all can-
didates for the ROC who had re-
ceived their active duty orders were
exempt from ‘sugh orders until
action had been taken on their ap-
plications.

Thus almost all the Davidso-
nian seamen who were plan-
ning on entering the Navy this
summer have been given, if not
an exemption from that fate,
at least a deferment.

The only explanation for the un-
expected change that was given in
the orders was that the‘ quota had
