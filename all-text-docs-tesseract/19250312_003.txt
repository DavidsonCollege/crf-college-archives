It was reported last week that Buster
Grey, the golf hound, would give up the

continue to play.

“What year are you?”
“This is my fifth.”

“Taking your M.A.?”
“No, taking my time.”

Bohannon—"I dunno, I never keep up with

“Yes,” said Doc Brown, “I have such hard
luck that if it was raining soup everybody
but me would have a bathtub and I'd have a

“No Jove affair is a real love affair until
you've seen her in perspective.”

“Say, it's all right to be modern and all
that, but, by gosh, I’m still decent.”

“What is the difference between a modern
and an old-fashioned kiss ?”
“About five minutes.”

Woods-—“Well, I answered a question in

Broyles—“What answer did you give?”

Woods—"Present.”

She—“How'd you get by in English with-

He—“I worked a cross-word puzzle my
