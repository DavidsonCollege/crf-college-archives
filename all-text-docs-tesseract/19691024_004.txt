Neil McGeachy: The Newest Face

There just aren’t many schools these days that
have a former All-American coaching for their basket-
ball teams. Particularly if he was an All-American in

football.

In keeping with the Davidson tradition of either
being one up on everyone else, or else being several
behind, our fine institution has joined that extremely
exclusive clique of colleges; and now has none other
than a real, live, legitimate football star and Atlanta
Falcon cast-off eye the future of its basket-

ballers.

almost as many goals as the
rest of the -team combined

“Naturally it hurt us, and
hurt us badly,’’ coach Harry
Fogleman said. “We were
weakened both in our offen
sive and defensive play with-
out Culbertson in the line
and Heiner at goalie.

“Up to that time, the team
had ‘been playing extremely
well on defense. Belmont
Abbey is the best team we've
played this year, and we
actually had a chance to beat
them. Each individual play
er for us was playing his de
fensive position perfectly.”

Fogleman had devised a
special defense to stop Ab
by’s high scoring All-Ameri
ca candidate, Joe Betts, and
is obviously worked. Betts
who had scomd 19 points in

nine games for the Crusad
ers, managed only one goal,
and that after Heiner was

injured.

“I can't say that I'm at

team captain Patterson said
after the game. “It's our
best game yet-and a sign
that we're improving. We've
got a young team (only Pat
