Cruz gives the insider view
on Nicaragua’s elections

By MARK PUCKETT

Inlightof the recent elections
in Nicaragua, Arturo Cruz, Jr.
delivered a fast-paced, impas-
sioned oratory of concern
about his country last night as
part of the events for Central
America Week.

Cruz is the son of Arturo
Cruz, a former presidential
candidate in the 1984 Nicara-
guanelections whoalso served
as a former ambassador to
Washington before quitting
the Nicaraguan government.
When he began speaking, he
stated, “I cannot use the notes I
had planned to use. ..so much
has changed because of the
election.”

On Monday, February 27, in
Managua, Violetta Chamarro
“captured Nicaragua’s presi-
dency ina historic rejection of a
leftist revolutionary move-
ment that seized power by
force of arms [Sandinistas], “
according to yesterday’s Char-
lotte Observer. Cruz addressed
the situation: “Ortega had his
militants. He had resources of
state. He even knew every-
thing going on in the city. And
the opposition to him was pa-

thetic. But there were two great
problems he didn’t think

about—Violetta and_ the
people.”
Cruz predicted Chammaro’s

win, but days before the
election New York Times colum-
nist Tom Wicker questioned
this view saying, “Few observ-
ers and not many more Nicara-
guans agree [with Cruz].”

Cruz said, chuckling, “Vi-
oletta isa woman witha broken
leg incapable of making a co-
herent sentence—and she won.
She is a symbol of Nicaraguan
tradition because of her strong
family, not a rock and roll star
like Ortega.”

Rock and roll star? Cruz al-
luded to Ortega in this way for
the following reason: “The
Sandinistas were popular in
Hollywood, not in Managua.
Ortega all of asudden becomes
acowboy, justlike Reagan with
a horse and hat. He starts ap-
pearing on the cover of
People—a cowboy, a rock and
roll star. He corrupted the ide-
ology of the Sandinistas be-
cause he realized how he could
control without ideology.

“Rightnow, though, after the

election, Ortega is the loneliest
man in Nicaragua; Humberto
[his brother] won’t even talk to
him. But after the election,
Ortega visited Chammaro and
the first thing he said when he
saw her was, ‘I love you’ and,
you know what she said?—'I
love you.’”

Nicaragua continually faces
mounting economic woes and
ever-present war, but perhaps
Chammaro can offer tempo-
rary panacea. In Wicker’s edi-
torial, Cruz translates Cha-
marro’s word to the people:
“We are fed up with Sandinis-
tas, contras, and the war.”

When asked about future
monetary support, Cruz said,
“Financial aid is not the an-
swer; we use it for consump-
tion—I know; I have seen it.
What we must concentrate on
is getting human capital back
to Nicaragua. This means get-
ting displaced persons from
Honduras and Costa Rica back
into the country.”

' Cruz received his A.B. from
American University and a
further degree from Johns
Hopkins. He writes occasion-
ally for the New Republic.

Wednesday, February 28, 1990 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By JAY J. CHAUDHURI

The Guatemalan govern-
ment has long been famous
as one of the worst violators
of human rights. According
to some human rights
groups, some 100,000 civil-
ians were killed and 38,000
people were “disappeared,”
by the Guatemalan military
and paramilitary groups
between 1966-1986.

Omar Estrada, a Central
American refugee, spoke on
his experiences in Guate-
mala last Monday. Estrada,
a leader of a student organi-
zation in his high school,
fled Guatemala in 1982 fol-
lowing government perse-
cution.

Estrada’s participation as
a student leader included
protesting against govern-
ment repression. . “Guate-
malans cannot live like
humans,” he said. Estrada
recounted how the army
threatened to kill him and
his younger sister with

clubs. Although neither of
them were hurt, his sister
still experiences fear and
cries when she sees a police-
men. After nearly being kid-
napped, Estrada fled to
Mexico.

The present Guatamalan
governmentis supported by
the United States. Accord-
ing to Estrada, this govern-
ment “is nota democracy; in
reality it is a military dicta-
torship.” President Venicio
Cerezo has accused those
against him, such as
Estrada, of being Commu-
nists. Cerezo said God put
him there so he could de-
stroy all communists, stated
Estrada.

Currently, there are
60,000 Central Americansin
the United States of which
10,000 are Guatemalans.
Estrada is now living with
his family in Greensboro,
North Carolina. He has re-
sided in the United States
for three years.

Bernal says invasion of Panama is not the answer

By TRACY GAINES

Fora few weeksat theend of last year,
many people worried about sons going
off to what could have developed intoa
war between Panama and the United
States. Since the U.S. sent 2000 troops to
that area (for the primary purpose of
extradicting Manuel Noriega), in addi-
tion to the military force aready being
maintained there, American troops
quickly subdued any forces conspiring
to counteract its purpose.

This military invasion reflects to a
large extent the continuing saga of mili-
tary forces in Panama, and is in part
whatspurred Miguel Bernal tospeak on
the topic of “Demilitarization of Pan-
ama: A Necessity” to an audience of
Davidson staff, students and commu-
nity members last week in the 900 room.

Yet, for the most part, he spoke on a
topic which has been based in almost a
century of controversial relations (not
just the last three months, as Bernal
pointed out) between the United States
and Panama, and on the need for those
respective populations to redefine what
the environment surrounding the Pan-
ama Canal should be.

In less than 100 days Bernal will be
going home to Panama for the first time
since October 1987 after having been
exiled by Manuel Noriega and his gov-
ernment for drumming up personal
protest against the illicit and brutal
practices of that government.

He warned, however, against the
flawed perception that strife and con-
flict and corrupt leadership have come
to an end in that small Central Ameri-
can country. He speculated even fur-
ther, saying that despite the removal of
one dark spot from the Panamanian
historical record, there are many more
which need to be wiped away.

The United States continues to be
extremely concerned with the protec-
tion of the Panama Canal Zone, but it is

undue concern, according to Bernal,
‘ because. “no one Panamanian (except

threatened the Canal.” Bernal wonders
what the purpose is of maintaining an
expansive military force if there has
only been the remote possibility of
harm coming to the Canal Zone.

The sense of this is that these two
countries have actually used the over-
protection of the Canal as an excuse,
and in Panama’s case “the military uses
the country for its own purposes,”
which makes Panama, in his own
words, “an army with a country, and
not the other way around.”

Panama, however, is not the only
guilty party in this equation. Bernal
wenteven further tosay the conjectures

military and economic aid, which he
says willonly goto the government and
basically “preserve business at the ex-
pense of the economy and the nation
itself”.

Allthisis considered while the people
are overwhelmed by ultra-impover-
ished conditions and havenojobs. Now
many Panamanians are homeless and
many buildings which once housed
corporations and employment oppor-
tunities, no matter how small, have
been destroyed. But Bernal suggested
that the money and renewal is perhaps
going to a new military installation in
Panama. °

From Bernal’s point-of-view, mili-

On the other hand, thei invasion par-
tially created an environment in Pan-

Referring to a letter he wrote to
George Bush denouncing: the presi-
dent’s recent decisions in favor of inter-
vention in Panama, Bernal said that the
invasion did notsolve the problems. Far
fromit, in fact, Benal says the problems

circulating about the CIA, FBI and the
Pentagon’s support for Noriega in mili-
tary aid and training is true. Bernal also
mentioned President Bush’s handin the
activities. For years, up until the time
the U.S. decided to invade, these agen-
cies have helped him to keep his regime
in power, while he placed puppet dicta-
tors where he wanted them, Bernal said.

Even before that time, Bernal says
that “intervention since the 19th cen-
tury has created chronic political insta-

bility in Panama.” Since 1845-1903, the,

USS. intervened militarily into Panama
more than 15 times, and itinvaded more
than 10 times from 1903 to 1989. He
‘believes that “non-violent movements
may have worked except for U.S. inter-
vention and blundering.”

Davidson political science professor
Louis Ortmayer explained for the pur-

pose of this article that the 1987-88

demonstrations to which Bernal re-
ferred included “speeches made by the
opposition every afternoon and shut-
ting down businesses.”

According to Bernal, the unnecessary
militarization which had been carefully
worked out between the two countries,

‘tarization is the basis for most of Pan-

ama’s difficulties because the tradition
of an on-going military presence in
Panama hasled invariably toconfusion,
fear among the people and outright
control of interests which need notbeso
guarded. Here are some points which
Bernal made showing the direction of
priorites, political and militaristic, of
Panama since 1903:

¢ From 1903 to 1953, the political
nature of the military had been well-es-
tablished.

¢ During the period between 1959
and 1968, there was “ashiftinemphasis
from protection of the people to de-
fense.”

¢ From the time Noriega, started the
drug trafficking business in 1971, up
until the invasion, Panama promoted

“the most illegal drug trade in the

Western Hemisphere.” [and of course,
as Bernal pointed out, Noriega was
head of the military in Panama]

From these and other facts, he made the
case that continued militarization can
only hurt Panama.

have probably been heightened.

“Now that Ali Baba is gone, what
about the 40 thieves” still left in Pan-
ama?” Bernal asked. The 40 thieves
being the PDF and the government that
was controlled by Noriega, to whom he
also alluded as “common criminals
who want to maintain their power.” |

In Bernal’s concluding remarks dur-
ing the question-and-answer session he
said that, “other countries don’t care
about what happens in Panama. This
recognition [of Panama’s rights] does
notmake Panama.” Headded that, “itis:
interesting to see the hypocritical na-
ture of these governments since the
governments decry the action,” but at
the same time like to use the situation to
their own political and international
wale a and Panama does not need
that.

If this situation changes people’ s
opinions and removes their fears in
Panama, his conviction is that a new
agenda will take precedence over any of
the government's plans, putting into
effect “the priorities of the people—the

end of the military iecogiteeans bes ay
and security.” ©
