Wofford,

Challenge Clemson Tomorrow

By JOE EARLE

After working some of the
cranks out of their play with ar
opening win over Wofford, the
Davidson cagers are readying
to meet some strong
competition over the Christmas
break.

The cagers will meet their
first Atlantic Coast Conference
challengers tomorrow night
when they host Clemson at
Charlotte.

This game will be the first
test of the Cats’ ability to work
against a tall team with their
new “‘run and gun’ offense.

The Clemson team will be led
by senior David Angel, a seven-
footer, but Angel has been

moved to forward, ousted from
his center position by a tall,
quicker newcomer.

Davidson coach’ Terry
Holland said he could not
predict how well the team

would be able to work against
Clemson's height, but said
‘‘we'll try to work inside and bat
the ball out.”

‘Clemson is obviously bigger
and stronger than we are. and
we'll have to play a better game
against them than we did
against Wofford,”’ he added.

Holland said that he was
pleased with the Cats’ defensive
performance’ against the
Terriers, but felt that the
offense did not move as well as
he had expected. He pointed out
that the team played better
offensively during the second
half.

“Once we began to execute
fairly well defensively, and get
comfortable, the offense

improved, he noted.

Sophomore Greg Dunn led the
team with 17 points in their
upending of the terriers,
followed by T. J. Pecorak with
16 and John Falconi with 15.

In keeping with Holland's pre-
season predictions, the team
played eight men for most of the
game, including sophomores
Dunn and Larry Horowitz.
Holland substituted freely
throughout the contest, and no
player stayed in for more than
30 of the 40 minutes.

Despite rather rusty play
during the first half, the offense
was able to move during the
second half, and the Cats
gradually stretched their 13
point halftime lead into their 88-
57 victory.

After Clemson, the Cats will
host conference rival East
Carolina. ECU will have most of
the team from last year’s SC
champions returning, including
center Al Faber, most valuable
player in the tourney last year.

After tackling Princeton and
Richmond on the road, the Cats
will face their first nationally
ranked com petition in
Cincinati.

The Bearcats also feature a
running offense, and have all the
Starters returning from last
year’s team, with the addition
of 235 pound sophomore center,
Mike Franklin.

Then the Cats face what could
be their toughest challenge of
the year in N.C. State, a team
ranked eighth in the ‘Sports
Illustrated” preseason poll.

After State, the team hosts
what Holland calls ‘“‘the best
Charlotte Invitational ever.”’
They will take on Cincinati in
the opening round, and the
winner will face the victor of a
St. Bonaventure-Bradley clash.

Over the Christmas break,
the Cats will determine how
well they can do against the
presently nationally ranked
teams, and how well they have
adapted to their new running
game.

As Holland put it, ‘After
Christmas we'll know how good
weare.”
