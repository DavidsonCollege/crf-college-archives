Virtually Yours... New Web Site Debuts March 26

_By J.S, STOCKDALE
Director, College Relations

Welcome to Davidson College
Online, Part Deux. I extend to
you a cordial invitation to check
us out at hitp://www.davidson.edu
as of March 26, when the new
site goes live online. I hope you
will be pleasantly surprised by
the changes. (The first version
of the Davidson College web-
site was launched on August 1,
1995. This is the first major
revision of the site, plus the
addition of several new sec-
tions, most notably Alumni and
Development and WDAV.)

Davidson’s new website
was created by Neologix
Communications, Inc., a new
company founded earlier this
year by Ron Chapple ’79 and
Rob Norris which specializes in
website development and
design. The company is based in
‘ uptown Charlotte but has also
expanded to the international
arena with a pacific rim office
in Hawaii.

The creative team behind the
new website was Ron Chapple
°79, chief graphic designer,
Bryan Skelton ’90, chief pro-
grammer and technical guru for
the project, and yours truly.
What you will see when you
check us out online represents
hundreds of hours of work by
the three of us over a period of
several months, along with con-
siderable work by other mem-
bers of the Neologix team and
others in the Davidson adminis-
trative staff.

In designing this new site
we have attempted to create an
electronic gathering place for
the Davidson community — an
extension of Davidson and all it
represents into cyberspace. We
hope that you will find the new
website more intuitive and easier

to use, as well as considerably
more interactive than the
previous site. We have also
re-introduced the “Faces of
Davidson” series of student
portraits, photographed by Ron
Chapple. Check out the site and
click on student portraits to see
what I mean.

Some of you are already
familiar with Chapple and his
work for Davidson. He came
here from New Jersey and
graduated in 1979, then stayed
in Charlotte to form Ron
Chapple Photography in 1980,
specializing in commercial
photography and later evolving
into a broader range of commu-
nications. He has done numerous
photo projects for Davidson
publications in the past 10
years, including three separate
“Faces of Davidson” shoots and
nine covers for the Davidson
Journal plus the cover photo
montage of the “Kuykendall
Years” on the edition out later
this week.

Chapple credits Davidson
for teaching him to embrace
creative challenges. He says,
“Davidson teaches you a process
for living — as times change
and as ways of business and _
living change, you know how to
deal with the changing environ-
ment around you.”

Chapple’s young protegé at
Neologix, Bryan Skelton ’90,
came to Davidson from Long
Island, N.Y., in August 1986 for
football camp and hasn’t left .
since except for one summer
back on Long Island.

Skelton majored in eco-
nomics. After leaving school,
he never quite escaped the pull of
Davidson. He had his first job
with the Knight Commission on
Intercollegiate Athletics, work-
ing with former Davidson
Athletics Director Christopher

“Kit” Morris. He then worked
with World Team Sports, a non-
profit organization working to
increase opportunities for dis-
abled athletes. Most recently
Skelton worked for Rob Norris
Communications doing website
design and now for Neologix.

Skelton lives in Charlotte and
in his spare time aspires to be a
professional roller hockey player.
He is quiet and unassuming but
throws a mean body check, I’m
sure. When asked to describe
himself, he pauses, embar-
rassed, then replies. quietly: “I
don’t know, I’m a pretty non-
descript guy.” I don’t know; I
find him quite descript, and I
certainly enjoyed working with
him on this project.

Skelton was motivated to
work on the project by a desire
to give something back to a
community that was so helpful
and supportive to him, first as a
student then later as a town res-
ident. “To me personally,
Davidson represents the epito-
me of community,” he says.
“The reason I am so interested
in the Internet is that it is about
communication and bringing
communities together. The
media have overblown the
Internet and see it as a second
coming for retail sales. But it was
created to share information —
that will be its greatest legacy.”

As for me, I was motivated
to further the evolution of
Davidson’s website, and in the
process begin to transform our
publishing paradigm at the col-
lege. My staff and I are gearing
up to publish things first on the
World Wide Web — with the
immediacy and flexibility that
provides — then secondarily
with traditional print publica-
tions. About eight years ago our
office was swept up inthe
change from traditional typeset-
