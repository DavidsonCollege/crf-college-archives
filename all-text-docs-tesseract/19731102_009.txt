The trustees are to be commended for their decision
last Friday. In desubsidizing football at Davidson, the
trustees finally put an end to the slow strangulation of
a program which was doomed to failure.

The trustees’ decision was prompted by a look at
financial reality, and the subsequent admission that it
was aksing tto much of Dave Fagg, his staff, and the
players to win a Southern Conference championship
while operating on a shoestring budget.

Most of the student body reacted favorably to the
decision, but I have mixed feelings towards the
move for several reasons.

On the positive side, I was pleased with the realign-
ment of the Wildcat Club’s policy. Under the new
policy set up by the trustees, the Wildcat Club will

distribute its funds among all teams unless the con-
tributor specifically earmarks his funds for a par-
ticular sport.

This move will grately benefit the so called
“‘minor”’ sports at Davidson. The players and coaches
of these teams, (specifically soccer, baseball, and
tennis) have been deserving of these funds for several
years. Hopefully, the long overdue recognition of
these sports and of their contribution to Davidson
athletics will continue.

One of the reasons for my discontent is the manner
in which the trustees went about announcing their
decision. It seems unfair that the issue was voted on
and the walls announced while the team was in
Colorado. This move, whether deliberate or not, give
the trustees and the administration a bad image n the
eyes of le outside the college. ;

The creaient source of my discontentment with the
trustees’ decision, however, is the fact that they did
not go far enough with their action.

it has already been proven that the football team
can not be considered a legitimate contender in the
Sotthern Conference because the school cannot afford
to give the team anywhere near the amount of money
that its opponents receive.

Why seoctans, did the trustees set up a program
which has Davidson competing nage these schools

hen the team receives no money at all:

the Southern Conference altogether.

In dropping E. C. U., William and Mary, and Rich-

mond the trustees made a step in the right direction.

The Davidson College club
football team traveled to
Virginia Commonwealth
University at Richmond Satur-
day. As has been the case many
times in the past the Cats suf-
fered a substantial defeat, 29-0.

the most part, shared by potn
teams.

VCU scored their touchdowns
on two long runs from scrim-
mage, an interception return
and a long pass off a flea-
flicker.

The Wildcat defense,
however, performed valiantly
with such standouts as Bob Wet-
zel, Tony Boon, Eric Scharling,
and George ‘“‘Tiny”’ King.

The Wildcat offense was vir-
tually nonexistent with the ex-
ception of the typically brilliant
play ot yumor quarterback Jim-
my Boyd.

Boyd’s bootleg runs and deep
over-the-middle passes to
Junior split end Lester Ab-
berger were the only effective
offensive threats.

‘‘Many of the guys on the of-
fensive line had never played
there before,’’ Boyd com-
mented. ‘‘Because of this we
couldn’t get a decent running or
passing game going.”

The Cats depended on the
punting of senior Bill Dupont,
