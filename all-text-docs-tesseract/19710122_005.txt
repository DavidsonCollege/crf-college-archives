Random Assignees Complain Of Cold Shoulder

AN ANALYSIS:
By ALEC HOON

The new Davidson social
system does not seem to
many to he the panacea for
remedying the fraternity
system aS the trustees évi-
dently had hoped.

In the first two weeks of
operation, there has been a
general, though by no means
universal, feeling of  dis-
satisfaction with the way
that the random assignment
has worked out.

‘Many random se assignees
have been unhappy with the
way that ~they have been
treated at their respective
héuses:

Daryl Douglas, niatctied
terthe Kappa Sigma héuse,
stated, ‘(Most of the peo-
ple I've talked to have been
ignored at their houses. I
think that this has been true
for me at Kappa Sigma."

Charlie ‘Parks, hall, coun-
selor and member. of the
Committee of 18, amplified
this feeling, ‘‘The lack of in-
terest by the majority of
fraternities has been disap
pointing.

“But I would add that in
the long run, this won't hurt
the success of the social
system; it will only make
the transition’ more painful
for everyone involved.”

‘There have been some in-
stances of harassment of
freshmen at particular fra-
ternities. One house took
food away from freshmen
before they had finished
eating. Another house did
not serve food to some of
their random assignees,

(Many freshmen said that
they felt they were being
purposely ignored and made
to fee’ uncomfortable. As
one Sigma Nu assignee who
wished to remain anonym-
ous complained, ‘‘The guys
are nice, but they don't
seem’ to go out-of their way
to make me feel at ease."

There were also those who
felt that there was much
merit in the new. system,
and that the fraternities
were making a genuine ef-
fort to: accomodate them.

‘Freshman class. president
Bill Ralston expressed the
opinion that while the reac-
tion to the new system was

varied, most freshmen
thought that ‘it was just
okay.”

He added that ‘‘much of
their reaction depended on
how friendly the upperclass-
men were at the various
houses, and how far they
went out. of their way to
help the assignees."’

Hal Whitworth, assigned
to the Phi Gamma Delta
house, best summarized the
reaction of, those’ who: were
satisfied with the new sys-
tem thus far when he said,
“I have thoroughly enjoyed
myself. when I have been at
the house.”’

‘While the brothers have
not done any somersaults to
greet me, they have gone
out of their: way to intro
duce themselves, and were
yery considerate,”’

-an FM station

Dean of Students Will Ter-
ry said that he had not been
made aware of any major
problems.”He expressed the
hope that students would not
feel reluctant to inform him
of the difficulties they have
experienced.

“If things are not going
well, we need to know about
it,"’ he said;

Terry admitted that there
have been problems in fin-
ancial agreements. ‘'Some
fraternities do not feel they
are getting enough financial
support from the college for
their random assignees. We
are presently trying to work
out these problems,"’ he af-
firmed.

In tryifig to reduce the
complications itvdlved in
the transfer to thé new so-
cial system, Ran (Coble is
now forming a committee to
solve any problems and to
answer any questions about
the new system.

‘What the majority of
freshmen seem to want is a
compromise whereby both
the fraternities and the eat-
ing clubs would be allowed
to remain on campus.

As SAE. pledge Jim -Dor-
sett stated, ‘I think that
there is a very sizable group
of students who do not favor
the new system. Even some

of the participating fresh-
men do not seem overly ex-
cited.

‘Perhaps some sort of

compromise could be ked
out in which the ses

_ wishing .to continue fellow-

ing the old system would be

WELCOME?

allowed to do so and re-
main on campus, -while the
others could work with the
college plan.’’

WDAYV Assesses Problems, Hopes

By DOUG BROWN
Staff Writer

Despite a financial crisis
and a failure to provide
‘‘new services,” the manage-
ment of ‘WDAV optimistical-
ly looks ahead to becoming
with educa-
tional programs and classi-
cal music to supplement its
present pop repertoire.

“T am actually disappoint-
ed in our accomplishments,”
said Ed Dobbs as he reflect-
ed on the activities of
WDAV.

He pointed out that the
station has been hampered
by ni8ney woes, but that this
did not really’ excuse the
fact that WDAV has _ not
provided any new services.

“Anybody can listen to
another station and get the
same thing. WDAV is pre-
sently operating in violation
of its constitution, for it is

not disseminating education- .

el material. WDAV was not
established to play as much

popular music as it does
now.

WDAV is owned by "Da-
vidson College, and. it falls
under the Learning Re-
sources com mittie. Its
chairman, Dr. Hopkins, is
also the> chairman..of the
board of WDAV. Since
WDAV is not mentioned in
the SGA Constitution, WDAV
will have: to jrun the election
of the station manager
separate from that of SGA
elections, although they will
be ‘held at the, same time.

The monetary difficulties
of WDAV have affected the
quality of WDAV, Dobbs

added, and it is supported
by grants and contributions.
$1500 was received from

the college this*year, but

Dobbs said
not enough.

WDAV applied for a share
of the activities fund be-
cause other organizations are
supported by it. Dobbs said
he was upset that the sta-
tion received only about

that this was

$1300 from this fund, or ap-

proxmiately 3% of the pie.

“Its been a real struggle
to have ends meet, and we
really depend a great deal
on commercials,” he said.

Dobbs sees some changes
for WDAV because he hopes
to see it go FM in the near
future. ‘‘I can’t mention any
names, but some foundations
have indicated that they will
be willing to finance this
charge.”

The administration has ex-
pressed interest in WDAV
going FM, and Dobbs has
received tacit assurance that
the college will ‘contribute
financially to this venture.

“This would not increase

’ the costs of operating WDAV
_ that

much,” Dobbs com-
mented. There are present-
ly no plans to continue AM,
and there will be no com-
mercials.

Skip Smoke will be - work-
ing on college FCC appli-

-cations and funding | and
Dobbs expe to see firm
progress by the Spring

term. Unfortunately, licenses

are difficult to get because

there is a lot of red tape}
However, it will not be

difficult to convert the pre-

sent facilities. New  pro-
blems will have to be faced,
and as example Dobbs cited
the need for paid part-time
proféssional hp in operat.
ing an FM station.
“ WDAV would be allowed
to rea@h Charlotte or it
would not go FM at all.
The Presser Foundation of
Philadelphia has pacer:

given WDAV $2000 for class-
ical records. Dobbs wants
more emphasis placed on
the educational aspect of the
station. re

In the past this has not
been done because the equip
ment or personality were
not available, Currently, ia
production studio is being
constructed and this should
aid to rectify the sian
