MR. BLYTHE'S APPEAL.

On the first page of this issue will be
seen a letter from Mr. F. L. Blythe,
the President of thé Alumni Athletic
Association, to the Davidson students
and especially to the Alumni. He shows
how the excellent coaching this fall has
produced a winning and fighting foot
ball machine. “Phen he looks to next
spring, when Davidson will be expected
to keep up the same record in base ball.
Whether she will or not depends on the
Alumni.

‘There have been no two coaches in the
South this fall more capabie than) Mr.
Fetzer and Mr. Harris. “Vhey, have in-
stilled foot ball into every nerve of the
players.” “They have injected a fighting
spirit into every man. “Vhev have in
spired the confidence of the whole team
and the whole student body. ““Vhey are
clean athletes and true gentlemen.

What of next spring? Mr. Fetzer
will still have general charge of athletics
but he will need an. assistant base ball
coach. At a moment's notice a coach
can be’ secured that would delight che
heart of every Davidsonian. We knoy
thar the Alumni will not fail Davidson.
Mr. Blythe appeals in his letter, Ut i
not his apneal only. It is the appeal of
every Davidson man, student and alum
nus to his fellow. that torether we shal!
work, and work now. for better ath
letics at Davidson. Quo Vadis?

CAROLINA'S EXCUSES,

On last Saturday the Universite af
North Carolina defeated the VooM. OT.
cadets go to 7. The Virginians put up
a hard and snappy scrap and fight to the
verv last. but were overnawered be the
weight and speed of the “Tarheels.”

The outstanding stars for Carolina
were Reid. Winston, Tavloe and Foust.

Mr. Bridges, the much-bragged-of Caro- R

lina quarterback, was sent in ta general
the team. and he certainly did blunder
the game up for quite a while. and if his
“Rep” is no better than he showed up.
it is certainly a false one. Tr will he re-
called that after the Davidson-Carolina
game the nrevious week in Winston.
when the “Red and Black Machine”
outolaved Carolina at least two ta one
in the first half, and held their powerful
team to two lonely touchdowns in the
latter half of the game. that various and
sundry evcuses far their poor showing
were set out, But coain inst before
the Vanderbilt game “Doggie” sent out
renorts thet be did rat have a reaular
first team hackfield that of six backs he
had that there was little or no nreference
between them. Yet because of the fact
that twe or three of the nlavers who
were in the Georgia or Vandv games for
a few minutes were crippled un he di-
rectly contradicts his former statement
with the hope of obscuring the real
reason from the public. The Charlotte
and Winston paners said it was a moral
victory for Davidson. Take vour medi-
cine like a man, Carolina, and cut out
vour flimsy excuses. The plavers on
wham thee based their excuses were
Bridges. Parker and Fuller. Bridges

hours after his arrival.

The DAVIDSONIAN. November 11, 1914

had a chance to show what he “might”
have dori¢, in last Saturday's game, and
from the way he messed that game up.
his absence from the Davidson game was
a lucky occurrence for Carolina. The
other mentioned as an excuse was Park-
er, and Mr. Parker surely had his op-
nortinity. te prove himself against, V.
M. I., but he couldn’t deliver what the
papers had claimed for him. He not
ooly did not star, but was not good
enough to hold his position, but gave
way to a player who played against Dav-
idson the week before and who starred
in both games.
Faller.
8. C.-N. C. game say that Fuller made
the poorest showing of any player in the
backfield. Homewood then was the only
regular player out of the game, and it is
said he is out for the rest of the season
with a ‘‘watered knee,” so why place it
all on a poor “cripple?” Besides, Fetzer
had some men who were used in the
Clemson and Citadel games who were
not in that game.

An imnartial witnesser of the Ga.-U.
of N. C.. Davidson-U. of N. C., and
V. M. L-U. of N. C. games has the fol-
lawing to say: “The fight put up by
Davidson against Carolina was four
times better than that made by U. of Ga.
and twice better than that made by V.
M. 1.” Now, Carolina. vou will have
to base your lonely touchdowns, which
were luckily gotten. and your — smal
score, on something besides yourself.
