Indian College 8
Presidents
Visit
Davidson

Miss C.N. Mangala and Mrs. Santosh Puri are prin-
cipals of colleges in India. They were in Davidson on
Tuesday as part.of a Fullbright Project: which brings _.
educational administrators from India to the U.S: =.

In their tour of colleges here in the southeast, Manga- -
la and Puri have found the community college concept
very relevant to education problems in India. They ex-
plain that in India, colleges are not open to senior citi-
zens and retired persons: They lament this loss of hu-
man resources ‘and_believe that community colleges. ©
which meet the needs of a broad spectrum of people are
important for India’s development. ae

As principles of liberal arts colleges like Davidson,
Mangala and Puri do not advocate technical education
over the liberal arts, however, they do believe in “need
based education.” They foresee more “open” universi-
ties in India which will admit people of all ages , and
they hope that more technical courses in Indian col-
leges will help students to better find their place in life.

, On Davidson’s campus, Miss Mangala and Mrs. Pu-
ri were much impressed with the new computer system
and the Careers Office.
