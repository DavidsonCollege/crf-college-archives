REPORTERS CLUB SELECTS
OFFICERS AND NEOPHYTES

At the last regular meeting of’ the Re-
porters’ Club the following officers were
elected to serve during the spring term: T.
T. Jones, president; A. N. Brown, vice-pres-
ident, and C. R. Lake, secretary and treas-
urer. At this meeting also new members
were selected from the Sophomore class, and
their public initiation will take place at the
basketball game and picture on the coming
Saturday night.. These men were selected
for the merit and consistency in their work
on The Davidsonian, which have been most
commendable. The honored neophytes are:
W. K. Pritchet, J. P. McBryde, R. C. Grady,
J..R. Graham, and W. H. Bailey.

Further business of the meeting was con-
fined to the arrangement of the year’s prc-
gram, and many features were discussed and
added that will improve the character of the
club, and raise the standards to which the
men must conform before they aspire to
membership in the club. With this meeting
begins a new life of the organization, cach
member keeping before him the part he must
do to make The Davidsonian the best col-
lege paper in the state, or in the South.

Literary Societies

Pandeinic

The regular meeting of the Pandeinic [.it-
erary Society last Thursday evening con-
sisted of the installation of the newly elected
officers. Those elected to serve their society
during the coming semester were:  Presi-
dent, J. A. McAlpine; vice-president, J. R.
Falls; secretary, John Bradley; first critic,
L. M. McCutchen; second critic, H. B. Ar-
buckle, Jr., and sargeant-at-arms, W. J.
Beavers. After the inaugural address by the
newly elected president the entire society
went to the hotel, where a banquet had been
planned. New plans were made for the
meetings during the spring, the chief one of
which was the decision to have no more for-
mal debates or declamations, but to have an
open forum in which everyone may join in
the discussions of the topics of interest. This
plan is made according to that of the legis-
lature and it is believed that it will be much
more interesting as well as much more help-
ful to all those who take. part.

_ Eumanean
The subject for debate at the regular meet-
ing of the Eumenean Society on Thursday
was: “Resolved, That the United States’

in Nicaragua is in accord. with the Monroe.

Doctrine.” Moye and,Fry upheld the affirm-
ative of the propo€ition, being opposed by
Kennedy and Alexander, After much good
and soundly based argument on both sides
the decision was given to the affirmative con-
tenders.

After this the regular election of ogicers
was held.

Those elected were: President,

Clancy Williams; vice-president, Frank
Daniel; secretary, Bob Kell, and. reviewer,
Christian. These officers will be. installed

next Thutsday night when a banquet will be
held at the hotel and new plans will be
made for the coming term.

Philanthropic

The extemporaneous debate at the meeting |

of the Philanthropic Society last Thursday
night was between Gilmore, on the affirm-
ative, and Hamilton, on the negative, on the
question: “Resolved, That the sale of fire-
arms should be limited to officers of the
law.” The decision was rendered in favor of
the affirmative.

The regular debate was on the question,
“Resolved, That the policy of the United
States toward Nicaragua is justifiable.” The
affirmative was upheld by Ricks and Mauze;
the negative by Haygood and Glenn. After
much good argument the decision was given
to the negative by a vote of 2 to 1.

It was decided that officers for the third
term would be elected at the next mecting,
at which time there will be a banquet at the
hotel.

Social News

Rev. Garth Speaker at
Vespers Sunday Night

Speaker is Editor of Presbyterian
Standard and Well-Known

Business Man

Rev. J. G. Garth, news editor of the Pres-
byterian Standard, spoke to the students at
“Y" Vespers Sunday evening, on the subject
“Grit, Gumption and Grace.” Mr. Garth
based his talk on a volume of poems which
illustrated in a striking manner these three
qualities.

The Scripture lesson was taken from the
story of Elijah and the false prophets. Mr.
Garth used this story to illustrate the quality
of grit. He stated that it took real grit for
Elijah,. alone, to stand up and defy the
whole group of false prophets, and to prove
that their god was false, and that Jehovah
was, and is, the only true God. He also read
one two to illustrate this, and
stated that it takes a real man to have a con-
viction and to stand by it through thick and
thin, or, in. other words, that “grit.” which
is this power to have a conviction and to

or poems

| stick by it, is one of the essential ingredients
lin the make-up of a real man. ;

Mr. Garth then read several poems illus
trating the quality of ‘“gumption.” He said
that grit'and gumption are somewhat smiilar,
but that, nevertheless, both
present in a real’man. It takes gumption as
well as grit to have, and to stand up for,
convictions,

ot them are

Grace, said Mr. Garth, must be acquired
from God. From Him we ean obtain grace
through prayer. If we pray to Him earn-
estly and faithfully, He will give us grace
and will*help us to acquire, or rather to de
velop, grit and gumption as well.
his audience against
refusing to do any but their own way. He
illustrated this point with another very ap-
propriate poem, the central thought of which
might be summed up in the following lines
quoted from the poem: “If you can't go
over or under, go around,”

He warned

against stubbornness,

Don't, he said,
butt your head against a solid wall. Ti you
find an obstruction in your way. which you
cannot move and eannot go through, then
Don't

anything simply because you can't do it ex-

find some other way.

actly as you wish.

In conclusion, Mr. Garth read Kipling’s
“Tf.” This poem might be called a short
summing-up, resume, of the qualities
which make up a real man, In Mr. Kipling’s
own words, if you can do anything that is
mentioned in this poem, “You'll be a man,
If you can keep your head when

or

my son.”
all about you are losing theirs, and blaming
it on you, if you can dream, and not make
dreams your master, if you can take gains
and losses in the right spirit, if you cam walk
with crowds, and keeps your virtue, if you
can walk with kings, nor lose the common
touch, if you can fill the unforgiving minute
with sixty seconds worth sof distance run,
yours is the earth and everything that’s in
it, says Kipling, and, what’s more, he
you'll be a man,

{“Consolation” and “Take That Rose,” the
two numbers that featured Wilson’s solo
!work, brought demands for more, with
ithe result that Wilson was called back
| for further solo work in the concluding
ichorus of the concert. Mobley, Wilson’s
accompanist, was responsible to no small
degree for the fine effet of the two num-
bers.

The Jazz Orchestra, offering the latest
novelties in» syncopated rhythm, proved
a popular number on the program. The
addition of new talent to the orchestra
has resulted in a well-rounded organiza-
tion, capable of superior work. Owen

McSwain, of trombone fame; and Char-

And they lived happily ever

ONcE UPON A TIME there was a man whose
life’s ambition was to take unto himself a
pipe. Time and again his heart was set on
some particular pipe—but poor fellow, his
dreams never came true. . .

Until one day a friend, experienced in
such affairs, gave him a few pointers. He
took his friend’s advice; he got some
Granger Rough Cut... It worked! Ina few
weeks’ time he was solidly wedded to a
wonderful pipe...sitting pretty, fixed forlite!

Indeed, but for Granger many a man
would never know thejey and comfort of
a pipe! Granger is so mild, so mellow, so
cool! Ripe old Burley tobacco, mellowed
Wellman’s way. And cut in rough flakes
that burn slow and smoke cool...

Granger's mission in life is to see that
no man ever experiences a pipe disappoint-
ment... Just stick to Grangervand your
old pipe’ll be a perfect pal—right through
