solved, ‘That all students making 90 per
cent or over an daily grades should be
excused from final examinations.” ‘Those
on the affirmative were Currie, Foreman,
Foscue, Davenport and Reese. Those
on the negative were Campbell, Hamil-
ton and Nisbet. *

The affirmative contended that the
purpose of a college is to train by sys-
tematic labor; that the examination is
not a real test of a man’s ability, and

the examination was too gre
thrown aside, that examinations are of
value to the student in enabling him to
co-ordinate all that has been gone over
in a term, that cramming trained a stu-

CIVILIAN’S RIFLE CLUB
TO BE ORGANIZED

It is proposed to organize a Civilian’s
Riflle Club here for the promotion of
markmanship. Dr. J. W. McConnell
has the matter in charge and the neces-
saty papers are being prepared to secure
the ordnance from the government.
Any citizen is eligible to membership,
the club. not being military in any sense,
but organized for target practice. The
War Department of the United States
furnishes the Krag-Jorgensen rifle and
120 rounds of ammunition to cach mem-
ber and additional ammunition may be
purchased at cost. Those who qualify
as marksman. sharpshooter, or expert
riflemen, are issued medals and can com ;
pete in the National matches at Jack-
sonville, Fla.. or Camp Perv, Ohio, Tn
the event of any member making the
State team he is assured of a good trip in
the summer at Government expense. It
is the plan of the officials to make the
ordinary civilian familiar with military
arms as well as to provide wholesome
outdoor recreation.

GOLF NEWS.

Within the next two weeks, if the
weather continues good, the Davidson
devotees of golf will have their troubles
very pleasantly increased by the com-
pletion of a new hole on the local course.
The holes formerly designated as Nos.
7 and 8 have been merged into one,
thereby making a very difficult but at
tractive elbow hole. ‘To fill out the
nine holes, usually termed a “round,” it
became necessary to construct another
link. The new hole will be known as
No. 8 and has a very attractive loca-
tion. Taking everything into considera
tion, it is a wise addition to the course.
The links are also being thoroly worked
over,

For several weeks past. efforts have
heen made by local members to interest
the other college golf clubs of the State
in an intercollegiate golf tournament.
{tt is the hope of the promoters to stage
this contest sometime this spring in a
city centrally located with respect to the
several colleges. ‘“I'wo or three of the
college clubs have responded favorably
‘o this suggestion, henee local golfers
i.e something to work for this spring.
