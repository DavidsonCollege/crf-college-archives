Drug Center Removal

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Associate Editor

John D. Allen, director of
Open House (a federally-funded
rehabilitation center for drug
addicts) has withdrawn his
request for permission to lease
the vacant Ada _ Jenkins
Elementary School.

The school, which is located
in the midst of the
redominately black residen-
ial Northwest section of David-
son, would have been used by
Open House as a residence and
treatment center for those
enrolled in its various drug
programs.

The proposal to locate the
center in town met with intense
unified opposition from David-
son’s black community. This
opposition was the major factor
in causing Open House to with-
draw its request.

“If Open House had not with-
drawn its request, the town
board of Davidson would almost
certainly have turned it down

Lilly, Professor For 40 Years,

Renowned For Gentle Manner

By CHARLES KENNON
Staff Writer

“Henry T. Lilly was killed
Thursday by a passing car as he
was walking his dog near his
home in Boone, N.C.”

Those few lines sum up the
end of the mortal life of Henry
Lilly, but they say nothing
about the man himself. And the
man will live for years in the
hearts of those he taught and
those with whom he associated.

A member of Davidson’s
class of '18, a professor of
English at Davidson for 40
years, he began to instruct
students in the ways. of
Shakespeare, Chaucer,
Beowolf, and Alfred in 1926.

A year later he was among
the first to teach in the ‘‘new”
Chambers Building and there
he remained, in room 305, until
he retired in 1965.

From Davidson he went to
Appalachian State University in

Boone to lecture’ in early
English literature.
Lilly’s hobbies included

Chaucer (his favorite) and
collecting old versions of the
New Testament. He was a man
of great faith and he had a deep
interest in its roots.

Hundreds of his students will
remember his courteous
classroom manner. He would
always address his students as
being ‘‘gentlemen’’, and each
one as ‘‘Mister’’.

Lilly always presented a
dishelved appearance in class,
but he knew his material.

And he expected his students
to also know their stuff. His
tests were long and hard, and
there was. much reading to be
done for any of his classes.

His pupils had an abundance
of papers to turn in. One would-
be scholar doubted that it was
humanly possible to read them
all and in the middle of one of
them he inserted, ‘‘I’ll bet you
didn’t read this, you old goat.”

The student lost. When he
received the paper back there
was only one comment on it.
Lilly had put at the end of it:
“T'll bet Idid-F.”’

Lilly had a fantas:.¢ memory
of former pu;i!s. » would
write them |et'ers congratu-
lating them on -uccesses in the

adult world, long after they had
left Davidson far behind.

In one letter to a former
student he wrote “‘If it is true
that I have shown just one
student that literature is a won-
derful paradise of delight then
my entire life of teaching is am-
ply rewarded.”’

At one party he said, ‘‘The
wisest thing I ever did was to
pursuade Mrs. Lilly to marry
me.’’ He was married at the age
of 47, in 1944. .

On the wall of his room he had
this quote: ‘‘A wise, judicious,
sagacious student will submit
his term paper on the day it is
due.”’

On the side of a 1968 letter to
the Alumni Association he had
written ‘‘Please excuse the in-
ferior characteristics of this let-
ter.

“I look upon a typewriter as
an internal machine from deep-
est Tartaus and distinctly a
product of the malicious
machinations of the Devil him-
self when he was in a par-
ticularly vicious mood. Please
forgive the mistakes.”

James Purcell, Professor of
English, said that this com-
munity will long remember
Henry Lilly. ‘‘He was, first of
all, a kind understanding per-
son, and after that, a scholar of
deep insight, but above all
ies a person of real human-

Thomas Rogerson, Professor
of Spanish, was impressed with
Lilly’s command of the English
language. ‘“‘He was aware that
every time he wrote and spoke
he was using the language of
Shakespeare. Lilly would
choose his words with care and
he thought before he spoke at all
times.”

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry stressed the humility and
politeness of his former Pro-
fessor. ‘‘Henry Lilly understood
perhaps more about what it
meant to be human than any
other teacher I ever had. He in-
corporated his humanity with
his teaching, and his mind was
brilliant without any trace of
arrogance.

“We talk a lot about the
Davidson College Christian
commitment, and of our com-
munity. Henry Lilly had that

commitment in a very non-
verbal, profound way. He was
the soul of gentleness.”’

The body of Henry T. Lilly
was buried last Sunday. But his
essence will never leave the
campus he was associated with
for more than half a century.

anyway,’ said Davidson Mayor
Thomas Sadler.
“The people who live in the
immediate neighborhood were
very opposed to that thing being
put there, and the town board is
not going to do anything so
many people oppose,” he ad-
ed

There are several prominent
reasons for the location of the
rehabilitation center in David-
son.

Residents voiced fears that
the location of the center in a
residential neighborhood would
tend to negate any efforts to
upgrade that neighborhood.

They also felt that presence in
the community of those un-
dergoing treatment for drug ad-
diction might make drugs more
available to young adults in the
community.

However, the primary basis
of opposition appeared to be a
feeling among members of the
black community that such a
center would be something
foreign to Davidson.

They resented the ‘‘sale’’ of
what they consider their school
to outsiders.

The general feeling is sum-

med up in the words of one’

resident who said, *‘This center
is going to serve mostly people
from Charlotte. Why should it
be located here?”’

School board member Ms.
Julia Maulden was one of the
few members of the community
to actively support the efforts of
Open House to locate their cen-
ter here.

She said she was motiva-
ted by ‘*humanitarian
reasons.”’

‘Men have to be helped by
men’’, she said. “‘This com-
munity owes it to their fellow
man to extend a helping hand.”

Now that the proposal by
Open House for lease of the Ada
Jenkins School has been with-
drawn, the future of the school
is uncertain. Sadler described
the building as being in ‘‘very
good shape’’, with excellent kit-
chen facilities and a gym-
nasium.

Indications are that members
of the community which
surrounds the school may be
very interested in converting
the school into a community
Center.

Sadler said that he ex-
pects the town board ‘‘would
like to help them in this effort
when a concrete proposal is
made.”’

The school has been vacant
for the past three years, and the
local school board, which
presently owns the structure is
anxious to find what Maulden
described as ‘‘a_ responsible
tenent”’.

Allen has not been available
for comment, but members of
his staff said that they will con-
tinue to examine locations for
their center, both within
Charlotte where they presently
are located, and in outlying
areas.

The Steele Creek High School
south of Charlotte has ap-
parently been given serious
consideration.

Otey Enthused About Vespers

By DAVID KIRBY
Staff Writer

The Christian commitment is
alive and well at Davidson, at
least if it is measured by the
reception given the Tuesday
night service of the Davidson
College Presbyterian Church.

The service, given each week
at 7 p.m., is designed to be a
supplement to the normal Sun-
day church activities.

“Since vespers were done
away with there has been a kind
of vacuum in religious life’’ at
Davidson, explained the Rev.
Rush Otey, the church’s
minister to students. (Attend-
ance at a  Sunday-night
vespers was required of David-
son students until 1966.) Otey
feels that the service does much
to fill this vacuum.

‘People have found it helpful
just to come together as human
beings,” he said.

Although he eschews any
measurement of a_ religious
program’s ‘‘success,’’ Otey
nevertheless appears. en-
couraged by the support shown
for the service. He noted that
the attendance of the meetings
has grown from around 130 at
the initial service Sept. 11 to an
average of over 200.

‘I’ve been very pleased at the
response so far,’’ he said.

The services features a dif-
ferent guest preacher each
week, either from within the
college, from a local church, or
even from other states. A sam-
pling of these guests includes
Dr. Bob Palmer, Dean of
Students Will H. Terry, Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan, the Rev.
Russell Montfort of Dilworth
United Methodist Church in
Charlotte, and Joseph Roberts,
Director of the Division of Cor-
porate and Social Mission of the

U.S. Presbyterian Church.

All the guest preachers are of
“very high quality,” Otey ex-
plained. He especially looks for-
ward to next Tuesday’s visit by
Roberts, whom Otey describes
as an ‘‘outstanding’’ black
religious leader.

“This is one guy everyone
would benefit from hearing,”’ he
said.

Another area of church ac-
tivity this year is volunteer
ministry to inmates at the Hun-
tersville prison unit.

“We're working in various

areas such as_ physical
facilities, recreation, and work
release,’’ commented Otey.

The church is holding a study-
orientation program to
familiarize volunteers with
various aspects of prison life.

Otey is also interested in con-
temporary issues. ‘‘I’m
available for starting any kind
of discussion group the students
are interested in--ethical,
religious,’’ he

social, or

remarked.
“The emphasis of the church

is to be very open to students.”

HEAVENLY HOTLINE
Rev. Rush Otey, the Davidson College presbyterian Church's
minister to students, is pleased with the Tuesday night worship ser-
vices. Joseph Roberts, Director of the Division of Corporate and
Social Mission of the U. S. Presbyterian Church and ‘‘outstanding”
black religious leader, is scheduled to speak soon.
