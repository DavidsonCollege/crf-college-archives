University Problem

We are following with keen ‘inter-
est the most recent squabble at the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.

The question involves the president
of the student body, who was given
an official reprimand by the Men’s
Honor Council at Chapel Hill. He was
found guilty of helping a coed break a
rule against entering a closed fratern-
ity house this summer.

The coed was suspended from
school. The student body president
was not sentenced, but his conviction
will, of course, be noted on his perma-
nent record at school.

This week a group of eight student
leaders asked the president, Paul
Dickson II, to resign. He refused.

Signers of the statement include the
chairman of the Men’s Honor Council,
the chairman of the Women’s Honor
Council, the men’s and women’s at-
torneys general, and the president of
the Interfraternity Council. Signifi-
cantly they represent the most im-
portant student positions outside of
Dickson’s.

Last week the administration at
Chapel Hill placed severe pressure on
Dickson—in the form of an ultimatum
—to resign. The administration re-
considered its stand after several stu-
dent leaders protested what they call-
ed “coercive tactics” by the adminis-
tration.

Thus, Dickson was left with the
weekend during which to ponder his
decision to resign or remain in office.
After informing a fellow student of
his decision to stay in office, he was

Proper Address

President D. Grier Martin's remarks
in chapel Tuesday have drawn many
and varied comments from across the
campus, as shown by some of the
other statements on this page.

We admire the president whole-
heartedly for speaking to the issues at
the beginning of school. Such a forth-
right approach on the college’s stand
on specific issues has been sorely
missing in recent years and has drawn
general agreement that the president
was correct in addressing himself in
such a wav to the topic of religious
life at Davidson.

It was the tonic of serious study by
faculty. and YMCA committees last
year and has been a favorite bone to
pick in recent years among professors

Noteworthy

“Just great!” is the general con-
census around campus this week
about the terrific job done by the new-
ly formed campus Social Council last.
Saturday. Many people are still ex-
pressing pleasant surprise at the
smoothly run activities during the
weekend.

President Dan Campbell and his
entire council deserve a real pat on
the back for last weekend for their
upcoming plans for the campus.

The attractive brochure recently is-
sued on Davidson’s Distinguished Vis-

presented with the request by student
officials.

The case of Paul Dickson could
have repercussions across the state
and possibly in all phases of student
government today. Having only sec-
ond-hand information of the case. we
do not profess to be too informed on
the case in Chapel Hill.

Commenting on the situation and,
on Dickson this week, The Daily Ter
Heel said, “He holds the highest elec-
tive office in Student Government,
and knew well enough when he was
sworn in that he was assuming re-
sponsibilities far and above those of
other students.

“For that reason, a Campus Code
violation—especially one which has
implications of moral laxity—is more
serious when it is committed by the
person who should be the most re-

nsible one on campus—the exam-
ple-setter. He is a public figure and
must expect close inspection.

“Dickson has set a poor example.
We have never doubted his sincerity
or honest intentions to do the right
thing, but the fact remains that he has
not been a frequent practioner of ‘the
right thing’ and has brought rela-
tions with the administration to an
unbelievable low.”

The Tar Heel went on to call for his
resignation.

Despite the tremendous pressures
placed on him, we believe that Dick-
son should have resigned. In doing so,
he should be bowing not to the admin-
istrative pressure but to the best in-
terest of all student government.

and students alike.

One of the most frequent remarks
in such discussions always referred
to Davidson's antiquated position with
respect to religious life. Such up-to-
date statements concerning the col-
lege's policies in other areas are sore-
ly needed; in the same manner, Tues-
day’s remarks presented unequivoc-
ably the college’s current official posi-
tion in this matter.

The remarks in chapel were not
meant to stifle student discussion in
this matter; rather, we feel, students
should now feel better and more sensi-
bly prepared to examine their own
feelings in relation to the college’s
current program of religious life on
campus.

iting Professor of Socisiogy, Dr. Way-
land J. Hayes, is a commendable ef-
fort on the part of the college’s public-
ity office. The handsome piece of
information is a new venture and a
successful one, we believe. directed
by Taylor Blackwell and his staff.

.

The spirit shown by this year’s
crop of freshmen has raised ‘more
than a few eyebrows among upper-
classmen. At the mercy of a revised
campus social structure, the Class of
1969 has demonstrated a taste of the
unity it will take to prove the merits
(o1 demerits) of the new system.

Sophomore Views India - Pakistan Crisis

(Editor's Note: John Thom-
as, a sohpomore from Char-
lotte, is a native of India who
moved to the United States
two years ago. Below, he ana-

tan situation. He received first-

It is a fact that peace is the
most vital issue for the world
today. There are serious diffi-
culties in the wav of peace but
by standing between the two
major power blocs democratic
nonaligned countries have al-
ways played an important part
in the process of achieving this
goal.

But when two such nations
strategically located in Asia
dream that the chief threat to
their security does not come
from an expanding neighbor but
from each other, it is obvious
that their differences have cloud-
ed a dangerously important mu-
tual threat.

Speaking of differences, the
main one is that of religion. Is-
lam and Hinduism have through-
out history been incompatible.
Today there is intolerance in a
section of Hindus towards Mus-
lims: There is some talk of dan-
ger of proselytisation and of up-

set of present Hindu majority
in the population of India.
These wrong notions and dis-
trust of Muslims are indications
of a deep resentment in the Hin-
du mind of past subordination
under Muslim rule. This pent-up
resentment of those days is re-
sponsible for the mental aber-
ration today of unwarranted

glorification of the ancient past:

and vilification of things foreign.
These false attitudes have play-
ed their part in instigating the

present. conflict. and are now.

thriving upon it.

In such. a crisis there is al-
ways the danger of a repeat of
the 1947 religious riots in which
Hindu turned on Muslim in pre-
dominantly Hindu India and
Muslim slayed Hindu in Mus-
lim Pakistan. Thus the present
war has faint reminders of a
retigious war shrouded by the
trappings of modern diplomacy.

Writing from experience in
India, the current war brings
to ight many faults in the pres-
ent Indian government. The rul-
ing Congress Party headed by
the scrupulous Shastri, which
boasted of idealists and patri-
ots has unfortunately become
corrupt.

The cause is human nature
and long continuance in power
without any serious threat of
displacement. The true remedy

Party capable of providing an
alternate government and strong
enough to have a fair-chance of
deposing the ruling party.

The Kashmir problem was to
have been solved soon after in-
dependence: in 1947, by means of
a plebiscite. India did not grant
one because of a valid national-
istic reason: it would lose, be-
Cause 75 per cent of the popula-
tion of Kashmir is Muslim. The
technical official reason given
was the fact that Pakistan had
not removed all its troops from
the state and still controlled a
part of it. The removal of all
Pakistini troops had been a pre-
requisite for the granting of a
plebiscite.

After 1947, Kashmir was set up
as a state of its own having a
pro-Indian premier and govern-
ment aligned with India. Having
had sentimental attachments to
Kashmir, the late Primer Minis-
ter Nehru made it a ~aatter of
unwritten policy that there would
be no plebiscite and that India
would always maintain and sup-
port a pro-Indian government
there.

Since his death, the ultrana-
tionalists in Indian politics have
been pressing Prime Minister
Shastri for complete integration
of Kashmir to India. This has
encouraged the settling of the

Dear Editor:

President Martin's talk Tues-
day was deeply disappointing.
It is almost inconceivable that
sensitive, intelligent and dedi-
cated men such as compose Da-
vidson’s faculty and adminisira-
tion can fail to understand that
forcing students to worship God
is a violation of the very relig-
ious freedom and human respon-
sibility that Jesus himself died
for. ,

It is further difficult to be-
lieve that these men fail to un-
derstand the difference between
commitment, and dogmatism.
Dogmatism remains when com-
mitment is taken from the con-
text of freedom and injected in-
to the context of compulsion,
where it never has belonged. It
is sad and profound irony that
our overseers use the name Jes-
us Christ in violating our right
to exercise religious freedom.

Said overseers would like to
ignore the undeniable evidence
that the very forcing of students
to attend worship services elic-
its their resentment and under-
mines the authenticity of their
experiences. But any child can
observe that a remarkably large
number of students imprisoned
in church on Sunday resent their
confinement. It is impossible to
justify the existing regulations
in the name of Christian com-
mitment without misrepresent-

very strong that the College is
more. concerned with the appear-
ance of Christian commitment
rather than with the realities
of that commitment. As Presi-
dent Martin noted, this does
bring a lot of money from the
Presbyterian Church. Must we
pay the price of religious free-
dom for the sake of money, God
forbid.

“Students don't object to lan-
guage requirements, science re-
quirements, history require-
ments — why the complaints
about required worship?"’ What
a naive question! As if all there
is to worship is listening to a
speaker inside a steeple-topped

mitment of our being could -be

it so ridiculous to ask that we
be given a certain necessary
freedom where our ultimate

commitment is concerned? The-

College may as well beat us
over the head till we confess,
“TI love Jesus,”

The College has an unfair ad-
vantage in that we cannot re-
fuse to pay homage to the exist-
ing regulations without missing
the opportunity to worship with
our fellow students or to hear
guest preachers. This is the bas-
est kind of arm-twisting. So
many of us would worship wil-
lingly—must we always bow our
heads beneath the shadow of
compulsion?

Respecting the ultimate con-
cern of Jews and Catholics was
a much-overdue step in the right
direction—but what of the ulti-
mate concerns of humanitarians
agnostics, even atheists? Can an
academic community be 50 pre-
sumptuous as to damn all men
who prefer to deviate from the
commonplace? Who are we to
judge the beliefs of others?

Davidson College. sadly
enough, does not appear at all
committed. It is obviously dog-
matic. It is afraid to face the
possibility, however, remote,
that its “ministry” to students
will fail miserably should the
bars to religious freedom be
lifted. How woefully misguided
can men be?

Cat 0' Nine Tails

By MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor

PRESIDENT MARTIN'S TALK in chapel Tues-
day touched on a continuing problem here at David-
son: the relationship between Davidson's Christian
commitment and her educational spirit of free in-
quiry. Since her objective is a “free Christian col-
lege”, the question is “Can Davidson reconcile its
Christian commitment with its promise to place no
limits on the adventures of the mind”

If “Christian commitment” is defined to mean
the infallit le and undoubtable truth of the set of
Reformati: \ dogmas, one would of course assume
that basic tly Davidson is committed to religious
indoctrin ion rather than a free quest for truth. And
many co vlude exactly this—but I think it over-
simplifies the problem.

Theological dogmas, particularly those of Refor-
mation Christianity, may be theoretically opposed
to a spirit of free inquiry. But since there is no
truly “theoretical” situation and no true scholarly
objectivity, the practicalities of Davidson's position
-are what. nwast be considered.

DR. MARTIN BROUGHT OUT many pertinent
observations: for example, Davidson's Christian com-
mitment has in the past enabled the college to get
the necessary finances for building a top-rate lib-
eral arts college. Minus the historical commit-
ment we might also be minus the contemporary
college.

And this observation underlines Davidson Col-
lege’s compromise between its religious traditions
and its educational goals: Religious traditions are
given official sanction and are stressed as predomi-
nant to the general public—then inside the class-
room these religious traditions are ignored as irrele-
vant to the very general goal of the quest for truth.
For example, how many history courses here empha-
size Jesus Christ as the central fact of history?

___ The clumsy and sometimes inhumane Reforma-
tion dogma is simply given lip service and then dis-
missed—and this is vitally necessary for the spirit of
free inquiry. .

This should be no reflection on the good men
we have here in our professorships, many of whom
have a sincere persenal commitment to Reforma-
tion theology. A practical compromise between op-
posed ends must be made somewhere and here is
the place it is done.

__ There are very few if any professors here who
will penalize a student because he adopts a non-
Christian viewpoint, provided the student can de-

fend his opinion with reason.
* * *

BUT THIS IS NOT TO SAY that Davidson makes
no attempt to indoctrinate her students with her
“historical Christian faith’. 1 deliberately use the
word “indoctrinate”, because in required religion
courses and religious chapels and vespers the es-
sence of Reformation theology is presented as the
way and the light with no alternative viewpoints ex-
plained or entertained.

Required chapel and vespers, as Will Terry re-
marked, are unfortunately the most practical method
to insure that all students are at least exposed to
Davidson’s religious commitment. Required ves-
pers and chapels in themselves are not unreasonable,

ut as required religious exercises they are unfortu-
nate because-students resent the spirit of indoctri-
nation in the services as opposed to the spirit of free
inquiry in the classrooms.

Dr. Buttrick and Dr. Martin miss the point
when they equate compulsory academic courses with
compulsory religious exercises for that reason: com-
pulsory academic courses are at least theoretically
conducted in a spirit of free inquiry; compulsory re-
ligious services are not. The probable point these
men were making was that in a well-rounded liberal
arts education some religious (once again Reforma-
tion Christianity) exposure is needed; but the ob-
jection nevertheless stands.

“IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SET-UP, why did
you come here?” There will always be some narrow-
minded individuals who bleat this refrain at any-
one suggesting any change. Besides this being an
ad hominem argument, these people fail to see that
this encourages an already prevalent attitude among
Davidson students: “Davidson’s religious exercises
are just part of the price you have to pay for coming
to such a good school.”

This attitude of general indifference, to say the
least, is the one most destructive to Davidson’s re-
ligious purposes. Though to be fair to the argument,
one should acknowledge that those individuals who
Sincerely believe that Davidson's religious commit-
ment will inexorably cripple their developing minds
would probably be better off at a more secular
school.

e * *

THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULT for me is
that Davidson is making ‘in “good faith’ a com-
promise between the theoretically opposed aims of

‘religious indoctrination and free academic inquiry.
Steps such as liberalization of the vespers require-
ment, aliowing non-Christian ‘professors to teach on
campus for awhile, show this good faith in her con-
tinual redefinition. So despite what the future may
bring both for Christianity and the world, mean-
while Davidson College is well along the road to-
wards being a liberal arts college second to none.
