Freshman Hall Becomes Mobile,
Buys 1957 Ford Station Wagon

The third floor of East Dormitory has found a
solution to every freshman’s perennial problem of
transportation. With the help of Assistant to the
President Bill Bondurant, the freshman hall now

has its own car.

Hall member Walter Walker brought up the
idea at a hall meeting about a week ago. Bondurant
had told him that Sergeant Raymond Clark of the
ROTC Department was being transferred and needed
to sell his car. There was immediate response and
the “Third Floor East Club” was formed to buy it.

March and Wheatley display prize.

Each of the club’s 15 members gave $9.25 to
the one trustee, Bo Wood. He obtained the title and
some Georgia license plates, so that the car would
not be subject to any Norht Carolina insurance laws.

The car is a light blue 1957 Ford station wagon
with a working radio and a loudspeaker very similar

to those in the dorms.

Costs beyond the original investment have been
low. It has run on gas supplied by riders and hasn’t

needed repair.

The varsity team opened its
season at the Emory tourna-
ment in Atlanta last weéek-

Pyeatt. representing David-
son, posted a 1-7 record in
what debate coach Ray Mc-
Millin called ‘‘one of the
best tournaments in the na
tion.”

Bad luck in pairings plagu.
ed Hobby and Pyeatt as they
debated three teams which
made the quarter-finals. Over
120 teams from across the
country were entered.

In their first round, they
contested Northwestern,
which has “one of the strong
est teams in the country this
year,” McMillin said. Eastern
Illinois and William and Mary
were the other two rounds
the first day of the tourney.

The second day Hobby and
Pyeatt debated MIT. Emory.
and Johns Hopkins. The final
two rounds were power
matched. They defeated Mid-
dle Tennessee State and lost
to Brooklyn College.

McMillin said that he ex.
pects the novices to ‘‘do very
well’ at the Georgia tourna-
ment and said that they are
an exceptionally strong no-

“Hunger art” is the basic
form of modern art and theo.
logy said Dr. Nathan A. Scott
in a talk yesterday afternoon
at the College Union.

He defined ‘‘hunger art” as
the ‘elimination of the dimen.

Scott is a professor of theo
logy and literature at the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

“Whether you turn to art,
literature, music, poetry, or
architecture. there is impa-
tience with the old myth of
depth,"’ he said, adding that
the “deepest sensation made
upon us by the new art... is
the sensation. not of pleasure,
but of great displeasure.”’

He described modern fic
tion as something ‘‘designed
to test the reader's capacity
for tedium.” Music, he said.

three we can provide a term

over and beyond the regular

only to. these who propose
serious programs of study or

Theology Says Speaker

Scott then explained how
theology related to this sort
of ‘hungar art."' Like the ex-
amples cited from the field
of art. he said, theology lacks
depth in the snese that it is
not satisfying.

He said the most relevant
theologians are ‘‘men who
also make us feel that they
would be prepared to say...
‘be patient towards all that is
unsolved in your heart and
try to love the questions
themselves’; the point is to
live the questions them
selves."

Scott’s speech was held in
the College Union yesterday
afternoon instead of in chapel
because the theologian does
not believe in speaking to
audiences that are forced to
listen,

According to the Chaplain’s
Office. Scott: was originally
scheduled to speak in regular

EPILOGUE

Such is the nature and tone
of the new program proposed
by your Committee. If the
new curriculum seems to
have about it a measure of
real ‘‘blue-skying.’’ of limit-
less expectations. it is be-
cause we realize that the
trouble with limited objec-
tives is that we might reach
them. We admit that the new
program is exciting. chal-
langing. promising, visionary
and stimulating. But we are
not alarmed by these quali-
ties because we believe that
a curriculum is a reflection of
a college and that it changes
only when the spirit and
goals have already changed.
It is the result, not the cause,
of a new awakening. A cur-
riculum is a tool and not an
idol. It is a pattern that ad-
ministration and faculty
choose to give to an institu-
tion's work. It is a combina-
tion of techniques, informa-
tion and attitudes whose pro-
portions are constantly chang-
ing. But it is’ more—it is an
act of faith. It is a confession
of a conviction. that liberal
learning can make one more
sensible, more _ responsible,
more useful, happier and
wiser.

These ideals suggest an ap-
propriate, and finat, warning.
Curriculum change, by Itself,
can be the opiate of the Fac-
ulty. No system guarantees
success. A football coach wins
games not because of the
spllt-T system, or the single
wing, or the box, but because,
in the jargon of the profes.
sion, “he has the horses.’”’

And so with the college and
its system—called the curric-
ultum. Even if we should come
up with what. was for the mo-
ment a perfect curriculum,
we may be certain that it
will not operate itself.

It cannot operate itself be-
cause liberal education is ba-
sically an act of discovery in
which both teachers and stu-
dents have essential roles.
The teacher of genuine intel-
lectual competence and ex
traordinary devotion and in-
tegrity is therefore the indi-
spensable agent of learning.
But, just as certain saints
have forgotten themselves in-
to immortality, so the great-
est teacher fulfills his indi-
spensable role best when he
finally makes himself whol-
ly dispensable.
