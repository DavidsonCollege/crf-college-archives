PAUL SCHLEIFFER rehearses his part as Skelly i in‘‘The Rimers of Eldritch. ce

The play will be presented in Hodson Hall starting on Thursday.

Controversial play sont

A controversial play comes to David-
son Thursday night, and will run April
28 and 29, to continue May 4-6. The
Rimers of Eldritch, directed by Profes-
sor of Drama Joseph Gardner, presents
the reactions of a small town in the
mid-west to invasions of an isolated
community.

Playwright Langford Wilson por-
trays small-town life, emphasizing the
hypocrisy and bizarre illusions of the
inhabitants. Threaded with sub-plots,
the characters all have unique persona-
lities.

However, the town itself is a
character, displaying a definite and
frighteningly predictable personality.

Club season closes dismally

The, town unleashes its anxieties and
frustrations upon Skelly, a harmless
and.misunderstood hermit, played by
veteran Paul Schleifer.

When the curtain rises Thursday
night, the audience will be confronted
with the murder trial.of the town
scapegoat. The trial will include flash-
backs of scenes involving the witnes-
ses.'As the action progresses on the
blue-hued, raked stage, the story of a
rape and subsequent murder will
unfold.

Performances begin at 8:15 in Hod-
son Hall, costing $1.50 for students
and $2.50 for others. Thursday night is
a bargain for Davidson students at

children in grades 2-6 with a type of big

“Blockheads” extend
services to community

Crop Lunch Block—Students meet
in weekly lunches, and the proceeds go
to alleviate world hunger. (Crop is the
hunger-fighting arm of Church World
Service.) Participants have also con-
tracted with the college dining service
so that students can bring their own
cups to meals instead of using the
plastic, disposable ones. The money
from the saved cups, so far over $300,
goes into the anti-hunger fund.

Huntersville Prison Block— Several
times each week Y members visit
inmates at the Huntersville prison for
conversation and some tutoring. The
visiting students have also sponsored
several parties for the inmates, espe-
cially a Christmas celebration.

Depot Lunch Block— The former
Davidson train depot is the scene of
weekly lunches, sponsored by this
block, where students, faculty, admini-
stration and townspeople get to know
each other over sandwiches and ice
cream.

The most active student service
organization at Davidson College is run
by leaders who call themselves “‘block-
heads’’ but extend their services to
every corner of the campus and
community.

The organization is the student
YM/YWCA, which has no connection
with the national YMCA but traces its
roots to a Davidson YMCA branch on
campus in the 1930s. (The group is
thinking of changing its name to dispel
the misunderstanding.) And this year a
new group of leaders, including several
elected by the student body, have
divided their areas of responsibility
into blocks, each headed by a “‘block-
head.”’

The new structure “allows responsi-
bility to be better delegated, and
students can work in specific areas
without becoming too overloaded,’
explained Y President Glen Darby-
shire, a junior from Moultrie, Ga. Environmental Block— Members

The major blocks of the organization help in glass and paper recycling in

Step Block — Involves the most num- letter-writing campaigns about nation-

ber of students, approximately 80. al environmental issues.
Step was formed six years ago as the The Seventh Block— Promotes stu-
Student Tutorial Education Project to dent-faculty interaction through “‘opén
provide Davidson Elementary School houses”’ and other activities. Members
also counsel with Davidson students
who are unsure about their roles at the
College and discuss with them ways to
become more active.

The Davidson Community Center,
the Day Care Center, the Senior
Citizen’s Center, the Home Winteriza-
tion Program, and a group entitled
"Exploring Relationships” are some of
the activities contained in other blocks,
in addition. to administrative duties
such as publicity.

However, a student isn’t limited to
just those activities covered by the
block programs. ‘‘The Y can provide
funding for any student who has an
idea for a service project,’’ Darbyshire
said.

Other newly-elected Y officers are:
Frances E. DuBose, a junior from
Simponsville, S.C., Barbara Wright, a
junior from Dunwoody, Ga., and
Thomas Niblock, a junior from Jakar-
ta, Indonesia.

Help Wanted: The position of Chancellor

By KEVIN ROBBINS
Club Sports Correspondent
Our Club Sports coverage for

the year ‘must end on a rather
somber note, I’m afraid. A
number of losses, both on the
field and off, have left us with at
best the old ‘‘wait till next
year” feeling.

On the field, the Rugby Club
was rather brutally dissected on
Saturday by the Charlotte Gar-
goyles, 25-0. The stunned Rug-

gers were at a loss to explain the"

harrowing defeat, unless it
could be attributed to the inti-
midating ugliness of the well-
named Gargoyles.

The Soccer Club lost to
Belmont Abbey 3-1 to close an
erratic season complicated by
one of the off-the-field prob-
lems: their loss of a home
playing field for the bulk of the
season.

The saddest news, however,
was the loss of the Lacrosse
Club from the Club Sports’
ranks. A rash of freakish acci-
dents crippled an unusual num-
ber of key players, but the real
finisher was a tragic onslaught

of E.H. Little Disease. As all
too often happens in student-led
organizations at Davidson, the
efforts of the few hard-working
organizers and leaders went for
naught as half-commitments
and half-promises failed to pro-
duce any reliable participation
by the other members. Some
serious priority-examining

needs to be done here. Why

should a stable club be forced to
fold because the majority of its
“committed’’ members won't
stir from the library for practice
or games? Joe, Tommy, you
guys tried your best and did a

commendable job. The fault’s |

not yours. But to all those who
contributed to such a sad
demise, for once you really have
some important thinking to do.
