to one of these two projects,

A project called CROP has
begun the idea of ‘‘food for
work.’’ This program helps
villagers and farmers com-
plete the projects essential to
their community and
economic development, while
it distributes food essential to
their survival not as a dole but
as a wage.

CROP is neither a foun-
dation nor a government agen-
cy. CROP is an organization of
people who want to give others
a chance for a change. One
way of providing that change
is through agribusiness:
giving seed, fertilizer, tools
and other items.

It is possible for donors to

Coleman To Speak On ‘Life’

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

(Ed.note: the following ar-
ticle was derived from an ar-
ticle by Michael Putney which
appeared in the National Ob-
server.)

Many people have wished
at’ one time or another that
they could jump in to a time
machine and travel
somewhere besides the mun-
usually exposed to. In a sense,
this is what President of
Haverford College Jack
Coleman has done.

Coleman recently com-
pleted his sabbatical, which
does not seem _ especially
newsworthy, until one con-
siders that he spent the
majority of it as a ditch digger
in Atlanta, a sandwich-and-
salad man at the famous
Union Oyster House in Boston,
and as a garbage man in the
Maryland suburbs of

Washington.

The Davidson community ©

has been provided with a rare
opportunity to hear Coleman
speak at 7 p.m. Dec. 9 in
Chambers Banquet Hall. As
one of a series of lecturers on
various ‘life’ topics, he will
speak on vocations.

Coleman believes that one
of the most frightening

Projects

pay the full price of day care
and because their family’s
income exceeds the govern-
ment’s poverty level they can
get no federal assistance.

In order to make up the
money that parents can’t af-
foord to pay, about $25,000
from community
organizations is needed. Out-
side sources have been
last year, but further
monetary assistance is needed
to keep the ceenter open.

One or both of these projects
will be supported by the
Christmas project.
Solicitations will begin im-
mediately following the S.G.A.
elections on Tuesday.

problems in America today is
the wideninng gap between
the country’s intellectual and
working communities. He
commented that the event
which spurred this fright the
most was the 1970 clash bet-
ween hard hats and young
people on Wall Street.

After working for a week
on a friend's dairy farm in On-
tario in order to get in shape,
he set out for Atlanta where
he secured a job as a ditch
digger with hourly pay of
$2.75. For the next two weeks,
Coleman layed pipes, dug
ditches, and kept a daily jour-
nal. He concluded that the so
called. blue collar blues and
the death of the work ethic
had been over-emphasized.

Next, Coleman travelled to
Boston where he was hired as

a porter-dishwasher (for $2
per hour) in a restaurant.
However, he was promptly
fired after an hour’s work, the
manager explaining that it
“‘was not his line of work.’’

The Havorford president
finally secured a job after
three days as a salad-and-
sandwich maker in The
Union Oyster House. In those
three days of job hunting he
experienced something of the
demoralization that takes
place when one realizes that
no one needs your skills.

As his final experiment,
Coleman travelled to Calver-
ton, Md. where he worked as a
garbageman. The suburbs
he worked in were mostly
white and middle-classed. He
experienced some of the
problems which anger
laborers.
