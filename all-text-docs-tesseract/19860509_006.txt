Baseball team sets hitting record in winning year

By BOYD COGGINS
Davidson's baseball team en-
ters their last week of play having
lost three tough road games last
week to Georgia and UNCC.
These losses add to the winless

Sophomore Charlie Winborne stretches for the plate

streak which has now reached
nine games. Davidson hopes to
end the season on a bright note this
weekend as they take on UNCC in
a doubleheader at home on Friday
afternoon. The Cats’ overall re-
cord now stands at 21-18-1.
Against Georgia last week,
the Cats scored two runs in the
first inning to jump out to an early
lead. Sophomore Bill Masse
started the game with a single to
left. Senior Keith Helfant then fol-
lowed with a rip to rightfield.
With men on first and second,
junior David Turgeon reached

Senior Keith Helfant skies over a base runner

base on a fielder’s choice when
the shortstop threw out Masse
going to third. The next batter,
sophomore Alan Lewis, singled to
right to load the bases. With only
one man out, junior Dan Simonds

hit a sacrifice fly to rghtfield
which scored Helfant. Turgeon
scored also when the nghtfielder
made an errant throw while trying
to put out the runner.

However, this lead was erased
in the bottom of the first when
Derek Lilliquist smashed a double
to rightfield which scored two
runs.

Davidson took a brief 3-2 lead
in the fifth when Masse doubled
and scored on a single by Helfant.
But Georgia regained the lead in
the sixth when Jeff Bennett hit a
three run homer. The Bulldogs

RBI single, a three-run homer,
and a solo home run.

Masse accounted for both
Davidson runs when he scored in
the fourth inning on an RBI single
by Lewis; and hit a solo homer to
lead off the ninth inning. It was his
tenth home run of the year which
ties the Davidson single season re-
cord. For the game, the Cats had
six hits with Masse and Helfant
grabbing two apiece.

49ers came back in the fourth and
fifth innings as they scored three
runs in each inning to take a 7-5

The Cats of 1986 have com-

pleted another successful season
this spring as they have won over
twenty games for the second year
in a row under fifth year head
coach George Greer. With all of
the key players returning from last
season, the Cats finished second
in the Southern Conference south-
ern division. This finish earned
them a birth in the conference
tournament for the second time in
as many seasons. This team also
set new records for highest batting
average, home runs, and runs bat-
ted in.

Leading the hitting attack for
the Cats, who set a new single sea-
son team batting average of .333,
was Lewis who hit .428 and set a
new Davidson single season re-
cord for doubles with 17. Turgeon
and Depaul also contributed to the
Cats success by hitting .363 and
.360 respectively. Turgeon, in
only his third season as a Wildcat,
has set career records for home
runs and RBIs, while Depaul,
who hit only .195 last season,
raised his average by 165 percen-
tage points and also has hit eight
home runs.

The pitching staff improved
greatly this season as they lowered
their team ERA by almost a full
run per game. The Cats top pitcher
for the season was junior Steve
Condon who won his first nine
games of the season and estab-

pitchers were Brian Moure and
Jeff Loser who both pitched wel!
as relievers and should become
two of Davidson’s top pitchers
next season.

The Cats won their twenty
games against the most challeng-
ing schedule a Davidson team has
ever had to face. In addition to
their Souther Conference
schedule, Davidson played four
Atlantic Coast Conference games,
Big East Conference champions
Connecticut, and Southeastern
Conferernce contender Georgia
Even with this schedule the Cats
came away with victories over
Wake Forest, North Carolina
State, Connecticut and Jackson-
ville. The highlight of the season
came when the Cats swept a three
games series from eventual South-
erm Conference champion West-
ern Carolina.

Davidson loses four outstand
ing seniors from this year’s club
They are Helfant, Waters, pitcher
Chip Knox, and Weaver. These
co-captains, who were the first
players recruited by Greer, have
contributed a lot of time and talent
into the program which they have
seen grow and prosper over their
four years. Much of the Cats suc-
cess this season can be attributed
to these players who have pro-
vided the leadership and experi-

(10), Dan Simonds (15) and sophomore Rob Zimmerman

lished a new single record for vic-
tories. Senior Scott Weaver had a
good season as he finished his
career with more victories than
any other Wildcat pitcher to date.
Other pitchers who provided the
Cats with consistent Starting
pitching were junior Billy
Waitsman and sophomore Dave
Fitzgerald. The top freshmen
ning team.

For next season, Davidson

will have a combination of exper'-
ence and youth. Twenty-five vet-
erans return with a new crop of
freshmen who will combine to
make Davidson a contender once
again for the Southern Conference
championship. With most of the
top batters and pitchers returning,
the Cats look to continue breaking
records as Greer builds the
baseball program into a perennial
Southern Conference power.
