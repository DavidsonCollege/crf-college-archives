News Editor

Glass Emporium owner Gary
Lindabury may: start using
guard tarantulas as a security
measure after the recent robber-
y at his North Main Street
establishment .

Lindabury said early Satur-
day morning burglers smashed
the Emporium’s street-front
display window, probably with
a baseball bat or lead pipe, and
removed six custom stained-
glass windows. He said thieves
never entered the shop, but only
reached through the gaping hole
in the front window.

‘Lindabury valued the loss at
about $2,000. ‘All the pieces
were one of a kind—all signed:
by the artists,’’ he said.

“There would be no problem
identifying them. They: stick
out like a sore thumb,‘‘ he
added. .

Lindabury explained the
pieces were all commissioned
work; many were just finished
this week. ‘‘They weren’t in-

Durden wins Davidsonian election ;

promises major changes next year

By JOHN SIMAN
Staff Writer

Junior Merideth Durden won the Davidsonian editebihip
Tuesday over Marshall Waddell by a vote of 312 to 259, according

to SGA tallies:

She will replace acting Co-Editors Ann Garner and Dennis
McLawhorn in September amd will serve through December, when

regular elections will be held.

Durden said she will elimi-
nate the Davidsonian’s motto
“The South’s Foremost College
Weekly,’”’ but will reemphasize
the idea behind it. ‘“‘The David-
sonian can be the South’s
foremost college weekly,’’ she
said, ‘“‘but we need not state
that.”’

Other visual changes will
include the use of a higher grade
of paper to improve photo-
graphy quality, Durden said.
However she added she will not
initiate many visual changes
and will generally retain present
typeface and layout.

On the other hand, Durden
described major changes in
journalistic approach. “I: want
more investigative reporting
rather than incidental report-
ing,” she said. Durden repeat-
edly emphasized the idea of
more in-depth coverage of news,
saying, ‘I would like to revive
something like a Focus.”

She said such news analyses
will complement regular news.
“Of course give (major) news
top priority, but when there
isn’t any top priority news, you
don’t blow up other news. Write
about something interesting...
something that should be
thought about and that has
been investigated,’’ she ex-
plained.

Durden said she wants to see
more page-three magazine arti-

cles. She commended this year’s
Life Abroad on the JYA Pro-
gram, Davidson Social Life
Before Co-education, and this
week’s ‘“‘An Old Man’s View of
Davidson.”

Durden’s approach to sports
will be to ‘‘have the athletes
involved write.’’ She said she
already has a commitment from
Varsity football player David
Donaldson. Such use of student
athletes, according to Durden,
will allow reader “to get’ facts
and get a feeling from sports
reporting.”’

A former Features Editor,
Durden said that section cotild
use ‘‘a whole’ different sort of
approach.” She feels that fea-
tuFés is now too much of “a
listing of what’s happening’”’
and would improve with articles
that were more analytical and
in-depth.

Durden used the coverage of
the Convocation awards as an
example of the type of features
article that could be improved.
A description of how and why
the awards were made ought to
accompany the mere listing of
awards and winners, she said.

While campaigning for the.
editorship, Durden emphasized
her interest in improving the
staff. To increase staff size she
plans to recruit people who are
likely to write well—English

‘Gypsy professors’ discuss pros and cons of their one-year contracts

By MERIDETH DURDEN

Senior Features Editor
One year teachers have been

dubbed ‘‘the gypsy professors”
and accused of teaching with
one hand and writing resumes
with the other.’ Usually they
are the young professors who
search for their first jobs in an
overcrowded market and are
forced to take one year nonre-
newable contracts.

As a rule, Davidson gives
renewable two year contracts
rather than single year ones.
“One year contracts are used
only in special circumstances,”
explained Price Zimmerman,
Vice President of Academic
Affairs.

Davidson has four teachers
on one year contracts: Benja-
min Garrett in Chemistry, Lani
Burnett in Psychology, ‘Well-
nitz in Biology, and Bohdan
Hlibtschuk in Spanish, Their
opinions of one year contracts

vary greatly.

“I think I'd go to work in a
factory before I'd take another

one year teaching position,”’
stated William Wellnitz, cur-
rently with ‘the Davidson Bio-
logy Department. ‘‘It is so
unstable because you know you
have to leave.”’

“They are a dead end,’’
Wellnitz bluntly stated. The
one year contract was an im-
pediment to such things as
establishing roots in the com-
munity,’”” commented Garrett.

‘We wondered about buying
a house if we were only going to
be here a year. My wife really

- had to think about job hunting

if it was just for a year.”’

Although Garrett claims his
year of teaching has been ‘‘the
most fun I’ve ever had,” he
realizes that ‘teaching is a
‘buyer’s market." "

‘‘When I finished graduate
school I never expected to have
a chance to teach at the sort of
institution I wanted to teach
at,’’ Garrett explained,‘*‘so a
one year appointment here of-
fered me the opportunity to see
if I liked teaching and if
teaching liked me.

Wellnitz, on the other hand,
points to several negative as-
pects of the one year experience.
‘One year is not long enough to
develop any kind of an academic
program,” he stated.

Wellnitz also sees them as ‘“‘a
cheap way for the college to get
labor. They just keep shuffling
people in and out of the same
place. So they avoid giving
raises, etc. This leads to less
than effective teaching.”

Burnett, however, points out
that one year contracts may be
the best situation for inex-
‘perienced teachers. ‘It’s a lot
less trouble for both ends.’’ She
points out that teachers and
colleges have a chance to see
how effectively the recent grad-
uate functions as a teacher.

Hlibtschuk recognizes that
one year contracts are ‘‘a good
tool both economically and poli-
tically’’ because the college and
the professor get to check each
other out.

But Hlibtschuk sicatioith their
use because “I don't feel that

one year is enough time to
acclimate oneself to the college
and the workload. It is not
enough time to develop one’s
full potential.”

Hlibtschuk is getting out of
the academic profession after
this year. “To go on accepting
one year contracts is profes-
sional suicide,’’ he stated. He
cites declining enrollments in
colleges and ever increasing
numbers of PhDs as part of the

’ ever-growing problem.

All four of Davidson’s single
year professors said they reali-
zed that there was going to be a
job crunch while they were in
