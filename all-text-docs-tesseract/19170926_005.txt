WHAT OTHERS THINK
OF DAVIDSON’S TEAM

The following is a clipping from the
Atlanta Constitution: ‘Those David-
son wildcats will be the next on the
schedule, coming here October 13. Every
season they throw a scare into the Jack-
ets by the splendid article of ball they
put up, but this season the Jackets will
he ready. for them and Davidson is in
for the surprise of her young life.”

We expect to doa little of that scaring
again this year.

I.. H. PATTERSON DRAFTED
INTO ARMY SERVICE

“Pat” is gone! Leslic H. Patterson,
e&-'18, left Thursday night for Camp
Lee, at Petersburg, Va., where he will
report for training. ‘‘Pep” was among
those drafted last summer, and was here,
pending notification of the Army De-
partment. This notification came last
week, and “Pep” left for the post of
duty. Our best wishes go with him, and
we shall surely miss “Pep,” especially on
those occasions when his services were
se mach in demand.

The business of the Commissary will
be continued as heretofore, J. T. Mad-
drey having taken Patterson's place.

DETAILS OF “PETE”
SAUNDERS’ ACCIDENT

One Sunday while at Camp Sapphire,
Brevard, N. C., A. P. Saunders sus-
tained injuries which have prohibited his
return to college. ‘Pete’? went out for
a hike to Glen Cannon, Falls, which is
about seven miles from camp. Several
of the boys went along with him, as it
was a very interesting place.

On arriving at the falls all went in
the water to cool off, the deepest water
being about six inches. After staying in
for some time the boys decided to take
some pictures. Pete and his companions
went to a spot about ten feet from the
head of the falls to dry in the sun. As
they were sitting there, he started to
change his position and raised himself on
the palms of his hands to do so; his idea
was to slip ina little hollow in the rocks.
Hawever, his weight was so great that
he could not check his speed, and he
went over the forty-foot falls. At this
place there is nothing but solid rock and
just as slick as can be. and this is the
reason he suffered such painful injuries.

He was unconscious for about twenty
minutes. Help was sent for at once,
but it was about two hours before we
coild get any one. [In the meanwhile he
was made as comfortable as possible in
blankets, etc., borrowed from the neigh-
borhood. He was then carried back to
camp and on to Asheville the next morn-
ing.

Just the other day an X-ray was made
af his leg and arm and it was found
that beth had to be reset. He was im-
mediately taken to St. Luke's Hospital.
Richmond. Va. He took the whole fall
on his left side and broke both his left
leg just below the knee and his left arm
in the elbow,

Pete will be glad to hear from any
of his friends who care to write to him.
altho he may not be able to answer them.

MINISTERIAL BAND
HOLDS FIRST FEED

The Ministerial Band held its first
“feed” on last Saturday in the old Com-
mencement Hall. ‘The purpose of this
feed was to get acquainted with the new
men and for the new men to learn the
old men.

The first thing on the program was
the refreshments. Everyhody enjoyed
themselves verv much, for there was an
abundance of “eats.”

When the refreshments were finished
the band was entertained by speeches

from several Freshmen who gave the

hand very useful informatidn about
their home towns. The feed was then
closed with several yells and songs.

Everyone departed looking forward to
the next feed.

REV. G. H. ATKINSON
SPOKE SUNDAY MORNING

The congregation of the Preshvterian
Church and the student body of David-
con College were extremely fortunate in
hearing Rev. G. H. Atkinson, president
of the Salisbury Normal and Industrial
Institute for Girls, preach a powerful
sermon last Sunday morning on the text,
“Win Christ,” Phil. 3:8. Mr. Atkin-
con, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs.
Keneble, was on his way to hold services
on Sunday evening with the soldiers at
Camp Greene. near Charlotte, and
stopped here to deliver the message of
the morning. Mrs. Keneble sang two
solos, which were enjoyed by all.

Fine Example of a
Loyal Alumnus

For the second vear in succession ‘THe
Davipsonian is the recipient of a gift
of one hundred dollars to be used to the

friend of the paper and of the college.
He realizes that THe Davinsontan
causes the college to grow.

The more money we have the better
paper we can give. The college au-
thorities realize that ‘Tue Davipsonian

want to see it grow. There are other
loyal and true friends of the college.
Are there not others among the 2,000

this admirable Davidsonian?

DAVIDSON PURLIC SCHOOL
TO OPEN NEXT TURSDAY

Altho future development may make
it necessary to further postpone the open-
ing of the graded school, the present
plans are to open on next ‘Tuesday, Oc-
tober 2.
have been carefully laid and Professor
Walker, graduate of William and
Mary's, has been in town for several
weeks, expecting at any time to take up
his work as principal. His associate
teachers for the vear will be Mrs. John
son and Misses Maud Vinson, Essie
fetton, Julia Johnston, Mamie Withers
and Gordon Baskerville. Altho a pre-
diction in regard to the number of pu-
pils would be hard to make, it is de-
sired to have a full attendance, and this
is confidently expected. “The postpone-
ment of the opening has been due to scar-
let fever in the community.

I am sorry for men who do not read
the Bible every day. 1 wonder why
they deprive themselves of the strength
and the pleasure. It is one of the most
singular books in the world, for every
time you open it some old text that you
have read a score of times suddenly
beams with a new meaning. Evidently
the mood and the thought of that day,
bred by the circumstances that you can-
not analyze, has suddenly thrown its
light upon the page and upon that pas-
sage, and there springs out upon the
page to you something that you never
saw lie upon it before. There is no other
book that I know of of which this is
true; there is no other book that yields
its meaning so personally, that seems to
fit itself so intimately to the very spirit
that is seeking guidance.—Woodrow

a very fascinating way.| Wilson.
