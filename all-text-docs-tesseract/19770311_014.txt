Lively reflects

on career, team

By STAN HALES
Staff Writer

Starter and senior co-cap-
tain Marvin Lively, virtually
the last player recruited dur-
ing Davidson’s days of bas-
ketball prominence, was re-
cently asked to reflect upon
his past four years of ups and
downs as a Davidson basket-
ball player.

Lively was recruited after a
standout career at Richmond’s
George Wythe High School,
where he was an all-city
selection. He lived up to that
reputation his freshman year
on the junior varsity, as he led
the team in rebounding and
assists and was second on the
team in scoring.

Injured early in the season,
he then suffered through a
dismal sophomore year and
accumulated little playing
time.

This season Marvin started
every game and was one of the
team’s leading scorers and
rebounders.

Commenting on this season,

Lively said, ‘‘For the first time
since I’ve been here, basket-

ball was fun. The team was
pretty close, and there were
never any grumblings.”

While few would argue over
the overall poor quality of play
in past seasons, Lively feels
that some great improvements
have been made and that
Davidson basketball will again
reach national prominence.

First, Lively feels there are
“better people” in the prog-
ram. ‘When I first came here,
there were cliques on the team.
It was hard to get along with
everyone.”

In addition, the coaching
attitudes are completely dif-
ferent. ‘‘Coach Pritchett’s on-
ly concerns are for the prog-
ram and the.players. He’s
always helped us maintain our
confidence and poise.”

As far as the future of
Davidson basketball and re-
cruiting are concerned, Mar-
vin stated, ‘‘None of us never
knew how bad the recruiting
program was until Coach Prit-
chett started. We’d hardly
ever had anyone visit in the
fall, and never had any players
signed before the season was
over.”

For these reasons, Lively
feels that the dark days of
Davidson basketball are over,
and that things will improve
considerably over the next
couple years.

His future career plans are
undecided at the present time.
“T’d like to play for a couple
more years, but I’ve got to

think about the future.”’

That’s not a bad idea for
Davidson fans, either.
