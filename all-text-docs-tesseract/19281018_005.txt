Just to bring an upset home to
Davidson, Tommy Scaffe and his
rejuvenated Terriers from Wof-
ford threw the proverbial monkey
wrench square into the hopes of
Younger’s men, ‘and proved con-
clusively that somebody besides
the Wildcats is apt to spring sur-
prises. Heretofore people have
looked to the men from Davidson
to pull the sport upheavals, and
so it comes sort of hard for the
eagle to come down to the spar-
row’s estate. That’s exactly what
happened Saturday, for the Ter-
riers tamed the Wildcats in ap-
proved fashion.

Credit where credit is due, and a large
portion of the credit for Saturday’s ex-
hibition must be given to that heavy and
speedy foward wall which represented
Wofford. Time after time those big boys
tore great holes in the lighter Davidson
line for their backs to scoot through, and
on defense they presented a well-night im-
pregnable front to the charges of the
Wildcat fowards. Four men of 195
pounds each helped the Terrier line to
outweigh the 'Cats some 16 pounds to the
man.

It was easily the best Wofford
team in years. It was also the
first Wofford team to defeat Da-
vidson: in all of the twenty-five
years that the two elevens have
been playing each other.

For three periods the Davidson Wild-

and clawed, with honors about even, in a
| gruelling grid battte. “tn the final quarter
Wofford shoved over the only score of the
game for their first victory over the 'Cats
in the history of the school.

The Terriers threatened in the first few
| minutes of play when Turbyville’s kickoff
| was fumbled by a Davidson back and re-
|covered by a Wofford player on David-
son's one-yard line. Wofford drew a pen-
alty for offside and the ball went over as
the Davidson team rallied to beat back the
Wofford charge. The remainder of this
period was featured by the punting of
Brock, for Davidson, and Oates, for
Wofford, with the Terrier punter getting
the best in the exchange. One of his punts
| went for 74 yards, over the Davidson goal
| line. To Dick Flinn goes the longest run

| of this period.

There Were no long runs or steady
|marches by either team in the second

| quarter. Again punting was the chief

| mode of attack with Oates again out-
| punting Brock. Both teams were penalized
for offside frequently in this period.

The third quarter brought the Davidson
stands to their feet when the Wildcats

Maybe the Cats aren’t gaining

is staring them in the face. Down
Charleston way the Citadel Cadets
Cadets haven’t forgotten that 5-0
defeat of last year, and it’s a cinch
that when the Wildcats get in the
Bull Dogs’ backyard there is go-
ing to be a scrap worth traveling
miles to see. It will be the first
time that a Davidson football ,
team has played in Charleston.

By all laws of average the ’Cats are
due to lick the Cadets. South Carolina
teams so far have proved to be regular
Jonahs for Monk’s boys. We weren't so
surpfised at a loss to Clemson, but when
Wofford gets ambitious and shands out
lickings right and left, then we begin to
get wary of all those Sandlapper schools.
It will take all the fight and pep the team
can show to cop that game, but we believe
they are going to do it. Stand by and see.

A week from Saturday will see
the Cats meeting their age old
rivals from Wake Forest. After a
bad start the Deacons are round-
ing into form. They held William
and Mary to a scoreless tie last
week. Now is the time to get the
pep going for that game. This
year the games goes back to Char-
lotte. Four tie games in a row
would. be too many, so something
must be done about it this year.
Hope the Cats are the ones to do
whatever is done.

The “Cat Trax” dope bucket was some-
what upset this week, but we're not dis-
couraged, and so shall try again. Here
they are: Clemson over Erskine; Wof-
ford over Newberry; Davidson over Cita-
del; Virginia over V. M. I.; N. C. State
over Wake Forest; Carolina over V. P.
1; Navy over Duke; Alabama over Ten-
nessee; Georgia over Furman. Here’s a
tough one to dope, but we pick Georgia
Tech over Notre Dame.

over,

Starting/a drive in the last period, the
Terriers ‘crossed the Davidson line after
a hectic march down the field. The chief
means of the Terrier attack was through
the air, catching the Davidson team off its
guard, and resulting in the only score of
the game. Penalties were suffered by
both teams during this drive. With the
ball on their own three-yard line, the Da-
vidson defense tightened and held for two
downs, all to no avail, as Finney dodged
around right end for a touchdown. Dar-
gan booted a pretty place-kick to add the
extra point.

Time and time again Wofford backs
hurled through the line only to be stopped
by the Davidson backfield. Sam Black,
fullback for Davidson, was in the midst
of every play, getting many tackles with
deadly accuracy. Brock, left end for the
’Cats, also starred on the defense besides
upholding the punting department.
