‘Soft touches’ work with inmates

Since the fall of 1973 Mini-
ster to Students, Reverend
Rush Otey and Associate Pro-
fessor of English Antony S.
Abbott have been doing indi-
vidual and group rehabilita-
tion work with inmates of the
North Carolina Prison system.

Abbott began his involve-
ment with prisoners in Nov-
ember of 1973, when he and
Huntersville prison inmate
Vernon Rich began to write a
joint weekly column in the
Mecklenburg Gazette. This
column dealt with prisoners
and prison conditions and
brought the pair the North
Carolina Press Associates
Award for Newspaper -col-
umns.

The column ran until Sep-
tember of 1974 when Rich,

sentenced to life imprisonment.

for first degree murder, es-
caped. He was recaptured and
sent to Central Prison in
Raleigh, from which he con-
tinued his correspondence
with Abbott and contributed
to their column again. In July
of 1975 Rich was transferred
to the Monroe Unit of the N.C.

summer he and Abbott ceased
publication of their work.
Abbott still communicates
with Rich. Their column
brought Abbott the reputation
of being a ‘‘soft touch,’’ and he

became well known through-

out N.C. prisons. He has
recieved many letters and calls
from convicts asking for legal
and personal aid. Most legal

issues were referred to Rich, ©

who taught himself to write
legal writs in prison.

Otey’s work with prisons
and their inmates has been on
a wider scale, though he and
Abbott work together occas-
ionally. Both, with Bob Mor-
rison and Bob Cathey, have
been named County Volunteer
Sponsers and are able to take
inmates out of the camps for
short periods of time.

Otey’s work began when he
worked with prisoners in a
maximum security unit in
Virginia. He began his prison
work at Huntersville in the fall
of 1973 and has worked with
the Huntersville unit. since
then. Huntersville was a mini-

‘mum security unit in 1973

with hardly any rehabilitation
facilities, centered on an ext-
remely small library and two
basketball courts. The unit

staff were aware of the prob- 3
lems but had apparently not

been able to do anything to
relieve them.

Problems at Huntersville
include overcrowding--a bad
point in the entire N.C. prison
system--and idleness. 175 men
occupy space designed for a
maximum of 100, with no
segregation between hard-core
prisoners and those of honor
grade.

There i is still an acute lack of
rehabilitation facilities at
Huntersville, Otey maintains,
along with a lack of full-time
counseling. Idleness and bore-
dome wear on the inmates.
“The prison system is just not

‘

working,’’ said Otey, ‘‘when
inmates escape just because
they're frustrated.”

Otey distinguishes three
groups of convicts. To begin
with, misdemeanor inmates,

who are incarcerated for small
crimes against property.
These do not stay long. The
second group of convicts con-
sists of those held for diag-
nostic purposes and who are in
transit to other camps. These
are the ‘‘hard core’’ of the
system, and are-.generally
sentences of between thirty
years and life. Group three

consists of honor convicts,

who amount to approximately

one-third of the Huntersville

inmates.

Otey sees Davidson stu-
dents as very able to help and
relate to prison inmates. An

example of their concern was

the 1975 Christmas party
given for the prisoners, which
thirty Davidson students at-
tended.

“Both students and inmates
realize that it’s sometimes not
worth it to resist the system,”
said Otey. ‘‘They have an
attitude of docility. It is one
way in which they relate.”’

The closeness of living
conditions compares too,’’
said Otey, ‘‘but it is compli-
cated in the camps because
inmates have no outlet for
their tensions.

Several rehabilitation. pro-
grams are being undertaken at
Huntersville according to
Otey. T.J. Reddy, of the
“Lazy B”’ stable burning fame
and a published poet has

‘developed the Huntersville

unit library into an dad@quate

The Office for Experiential Pro-
grams and Life Work planning has
information on potential off-campus
learning experiences which more
students should be aware of.

Sunimer job information is now
waiting to be used by would-be
workers. Director of Placement Ken
Wood’s knowledge and the catalogues
in the Resource Room adjacent to the
office contain together thousands of
potential opportunities.

Examples of what is being done
now reflect summer possibilities.
There are ten people off-campus this
term involved in far-flung educational
experiences. Among them are Zack
Murrell who is working with the
superintendent at Mount Morrow
State Park in North Carolina.

Betty Parks is leaning about
pre-school children with learning
disabilities at the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

Tom White and Ken Culberson are
with Knox Development Foundation
in central Jamaica trying to develop a
feeding system for hogs and a
conversion system for methane gas,
both useful projects to the developing
country.

Examples of interesting off-campus
activities pursued by enrolled stu-
dents include Earnest Barry working
for Mecklenburg County, Mark Wil-
ensky ‘working for the County Chair-
man and Steve Holman involved with
the Charlotte Area Fund.

There are three basic gouls of these |
types of programs according to
Wood. ‘First, to help students
identify their own uniqueness in
terms of skills, values, personality,
traits, and interests.

“Second, to help them decide where
they want to apply that uniqueness in
terms of needs, organizations and
geography.

_summer, off-campus posts

“Finally, how to generate the skills
and contacts necessary to get them-
selves working where and how they

want to be--without having to relin-

quish the control of their career to
employrrent agencies,’’

Much depends upon the students’
imagination and initiative in making
such opportunities materialize.

In response to my statement that it
was up to each individual to decide his
own direction Wood noted, “We are
not into making those kinds of
decisions for anybody. It is essential
for each student to know what he
wants to do and why.”

For the student who knows neither
what he wants to do nor why, there
are other ways to learn more about
himself.

The major effort in this area is the
Life'Work Planning Program. One
weekday is spent in Charlotte track-
ing down information about what
each individual is interested in

‘pursuing, after the group has spent

three to four sessions working
through exercises such as: listing
what one would like about future
living/working conditions; listing the
people you now enjoy working with
and looking for patterns; building the
highest possible tower with tinker
toys in small groups to discover what
part of work you like the best--the
leadership roles, the affiliation with
others, the goal of creating something
greater than others have done before;
analyzing what is commonly satis-
fying between the ten most important
achievements of your past; taking a
look at the results of the Strong-
Campbell Vocational Inventory and
Myers-Briggs Personality Test;
looking through an issue of perhaps
The Wall Street Journal to study
what needs doing in the world and
where you want to work; writing
