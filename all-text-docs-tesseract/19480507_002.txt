In approaching the dilemma, the
following factors have occurred to

me and to various other students
this year (1) Are there some or-
ganizations on this campus which

are not worth the time and trouble
it takes to maintain them? If so,
would it not be prudent to get rid
of them, in spite of the embarrass-
ment involved? of the
tional honorary groups
very high membership fees—is it
possible that they are maintained
just because of the dubious prestige
they bring or because the current
student generation is reluctant to
discontinue _them, thus being
labelled as having lost theif,campus
spirit? In short, do some of our
organizations take away more in
time and effort than they give back

Just so much trivia (which, . for-

tunatély is not true of most of our
faculty), he finds himself in the
position of the man who jumps out
a window to disprove the law of
gravity. On the other hand, the
student is fully as much in need
of advice which encourages him to
give the necessary attention to his
school work and which ‘will inspire
him on to an accomplishment
greater than the “gentleman's C.”
Both academic and non-academic
work will be complemented, when
they are integrated; and-only then.

If

we fail to solve the extra-
curricular problem, we are en-
couraging our students to be
furiously “busy here and there,”
always racing from one meeting to
another, — praising mediocrity in

everything, never knowing the sat-

isfaction of a job well done,

We will be paramounting the
kind of “outside activities” which
are the chief excuse for inside
activity in the American college.”

Sincerly,
