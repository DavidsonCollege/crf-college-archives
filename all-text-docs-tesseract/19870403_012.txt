The United States policy toward Nicaragua has been to
support military action, but also to rely upon negotiation.
There have been a series of efforts to pursue diplomatic and
political paths to peace and security. in the region. In 1983,
the President of the United States appointed the Bipartisan

“Commission on Central America headed by former Secret-
ary of State Henry Kissinger, and its report includes recom-
mendations for seeking a peaceful solution. The Contadora
nations have put forward their blue print for peace. Unfor-
tunately, despite efforts of the Contadora nations, the Sup-
port Group, the United Nations and. the Organization of
American States, the Contadora process has been stalled
for some time. The United States, relying on military pres-
sure to force change by Nicaragua, has found military pres-
sure easier than bringing about political change.

. Finally, there is a ray of new hope. Last week, through
the extraordinary efforts of President Oscar Arias of Cost
Rica, the Presidents of the four Central American democ-
racies met in San Jose and set forth their plan for peace, se-
curity and democratization in the region. They have invited
Nicaragua to join them in estalishing a peaceful and democ-
ratic Central America. These are the nations most affected
by the path of Nicaragua. This proposal by President Arias
contains the following points:

1. National reconciliation, begun with amnesty for
political and related offenses, monitored by a commission,
arid dialogue with non- military i internal Opposition groups.

2. A cease fire.

3. A process that would lead to a democratic represen-
tative form of government, with honest periodic elections
and guaranteed civil rights.

4. Free and democratic elections, which would be mon-
itored by the OAS, for membership on the newly-created
Central American Parliament.

5. A suspension of all extraregional military aid, overt
or covert, to insurgent or irregular forces.

6. An end to attempts to destabilize the governments of
Central American countries.

7. A reduction of arms.

8. Creation of a committee comprised of the Secretaries
General of the United Nations and Organization of Ameri-
can States and the foreign ministers of the Contadora group
and the Support Group to supervise and verify execution of
the plan.

9. An evaluation of progress by the: Presidents of the
five Central American countries.

10. Economic and cultural agreements which will per-
mit accelerated development.

Can the Costa Rican initiative succeed? President Arias
thinks it might, that it may convince Nicaragua to reconcile
with its neighbors in peace. And, it should be remembered,
the Nicaraguans recently adopted a constitution providing
for free institutions and regular elections; and although sus-
pended, it is a document on which the Costa Rican initia-
_ tive can focus. it is encouraging that the Nicaraguan gov-
ernment accepted, within three days, the invitation to meet

_with the four democracies in Esquipulas, Guatemala, to
discuss the Costa Rican proposal.

The Sandinistas have ample reason to seek a political
reconciliation, both with their internal opposition and with
their neighbors. Within Nicaragua, there is significant civil
resistance to the Sandinista government, including the
other political parties, business leaders, the religious and
civic leaders, and others. The people are unhappy with
food and consumer goods shortages. The economy is reel-
ing. Nearly half of their budget goes to miltary defense.
Their foreign debt is rising. They need a change.

With this latest peace proposal, Costa Rica; the re-
gion’s strongest and oldest democracy, has taken the initia-
tive, drawing together in unity the other three democracies,
and urging the fifth country , Nicaragua, to join in democra-
tic assurances of peace, justice, freedom and security.

This is an historic moment — the Central Americans
have seized their own destiny and spoken with one voice
for democracy and peace. Who better to craft a peace plan
‘for the region than the democratic governments of the re-
gion? Who better to appeal to Nicaragua than its neighbors,
whose history, geography and culture are so closely en-
twined?

This Central American proposal merits our full sup-
port. It is a.bold effort by the four Central American gov-
ernments which have the most at stake. It cannot succeed

without the help and endorsement of the United States.
They deserve our strong support.
