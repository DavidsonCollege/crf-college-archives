the top seeded Cleveland In-
dians dealing the Deals a 69-47
flush. After an early injury to
Randy “Nate Thurmond” Thom-

detense and mauled the Deals
with just four players. Mark
Rodgeman had 27 and Dennis

ping a surprising PAX A 66-48
as Hy Lankenau ‘our best ac-
tor) scored 19 points. Em 1
cruised past US 63-53 despite
Sam Upchurch’s 24. Larry Rud-
dell led the winners with 20.

A strong pre-tourney favorite.
PDT 1 rolled over the hapless
Wizardry as Chris Young and
Randall Hastings threw in 15

apiece
The SPE’s had an_unex-
pectedly easy time in_ their

opening game as they crushed
the erratic Soul Patrol 83-54.
Bob Horton and Bill Alexander
led the nationals with 18 apiece.

In perhaps the most exciting
opening game. an_ inter-
fraternity battle. the sup-
posedly third best Delt team.
PDT 3. threw a scare into the
best of the brothers before suc-
cumbing in overtime 51-45. Jim
Brown led the winners with 17.

The Pikas put their un-
defeated streak on the line in a
no contest against PDT 2. Final
score: Pikas 62 - PDT 46. The
Pikas’ balanced scoring offset
Gary ‘‘Hondo’’ Pomeroy's 21
points for the losers.

In the final opening game the
Old Men, behind Rollie Sum-
mwalt's tourney high of 31
points, whippe@SAE 1 61-54.

In tne quarters, things went

as expected. The Tribe beat the
SPEs 51-48 in a game that the

SPEs should have won. Mean
while the Pikas rolled over Fan
nv and Mabel 71-58) The Delts
moved on with a 57-47 win over
Emanon, and the Old) Men
finally retired as they were
eliminated by PDG. 68-45

Then came three strange
games. First in the semis. the
Pikas defeated POD } by a
score of 57-48. The game was
described by both teams as
somewhat of an indoor rugby
game. Mike Whalen had 15
points to lead the Pikas as Chris
Young and Marty Williamson
were held to 15 between the two
of them. They also combined for
the maximum 10 fouls in the
second half

The other semi match, which
pitted PDT 1 against the In-
dians. was unfortunate in that it
was refereed by two Delts
Although C.A. and Young Buck
feel they cannot comment on
the fairness of the officials, (not
having been in attendance). we
think it was not in good
judgement by the Delt officials
to put themselves in a position
where their integrity could be
questioned. Anyway the final
was PDT 65-Cleveland 56.

In the tinal the smooth and
easy Pikas. playing sparkling
defense, out finnessed the tough
Delt team, 58-48. Randy Wagner
dropped in 16 and spearheaded
the “‘D’’. while Dennis Watson
controlled the Pikas’ attack and
scored 14. Pika assistant coach
Tom ‘‘Beached Whale” Verlin
summed it up when he said
“The Pikas are the UCLA of
Davidson intramural basket-
ball.”’

In first round action in league
B the top seeded S-3 came from
behind to defeat the S-1 sadists
62-50, as forward Mike Eubanks
poured in 20 points.

Golfers Start Slate
In Palmetto Event

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

Despite a demanding
schedule, Athletic Director
Tom Scott feels that his golf
team has a good chance at win-
ning the Southern Conference
title this spring.

The season opens with the
Palmetto Invitational on March
15. There will be 17 teams at the
match representing the
Southern Conference, the ACC,
the Southeastern Conference.
the Big Ten, as well as several
independents.

The team will be hurt by the
loss of number one golfer Rusty
Boyd in the tournament, but
Scott still feels that the team
will make a good showing.

/ ‘It will really be our first test
of the year,"’ Scott said, ““We
haven't had a chance to work
together yet. “

Scott felt that the team will
not win the tournament though.
Several of the better teams in
the country will be present.

The tournament will also be
an opportunity’ to assess
Davidson's chances in the
Southern Tournament this year.
Furman and East Carolina,
both of whom have won the con-
ference in recent years, will be
present.

Scott feels that the key to the
hopes of this year’s team lies

with the freshmen on the team.
George Wilson, Jerrel Horne
and Tim Hose are all expected
to add the depth that was
missing from last year's team.

Last year we were pretty
solid through the first three or
four men but we had trouble at
the bottom of the team.” Scott
said.

“This year we'll have the
depth and I think we can look
forward to a good season,”
Scott continued.

Regarding Davidson's chan-
ces in the conference Scott was
optimistic.

“This is probably the best
team we've had since we won
the conference,"’ he said.

Scott closed out his comments
on the up-coming season
Saying, “‘This is the year we'll
have to be reckoned with."

Surprising Grey House was
nipped by MeCanns 41-35.
Meanwhile Several Species

night. S-3 and the SS both picked
up wins to advance to the finals.
The SS crushed Em 2 53-40 as
Jim Menair and Chris Holly
combined for 25 points. Across
the way S-3 was eliminating Me-
Canns 48-36 with Eubanks and
Ken Schmader scoring 14 points
each.

Inexperience Poses Problems

As Cat Runners Open Season

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor _

Track at Davidson this spring
is a big question mark.

Two reasons explain
seemingly doubtful outlook.

First, Sterling Martin will be
assuming the head coaching
duties for the first time. Second,
he will be fielding a very young
and inexperienced team.

Missing from the familiar pic-
ture of Davidson track of recent
years are the faces of Ray
Swetenburg and Tommy Richar-
dson.

Both of these athletes were in-
dividual conference champions
in their four-year careers.
Swetenburg holds six school
records, while Richardson
always got points for the Cats in
the sprints.

Martin's first job will be fin-
ding replacements in the events
these two men excelled in.

Nine lettermen return from
last year's squad to provide
some nucleus for Martin to
work with.

David Crumpler and Ron
Clark are two seniors who will
lead the team. They compete in
the discus and the three-mile
run, respectively. They will co-
captain the Cats.

Steve Shankweiler is the lone

this

junior returnee. He will be the

top man in the shot put and will
also throw the discus.

Most of the lettermen are
sophomores. Led by Rick Bell
and Mark Connors, six second-
year men will help the Cats in
the experience bracket.

After having a good cross
country season, Bell will be out
to have a good year on the
track. Connors will be adding
the 100 and 220 yard dashes to

his specialty. the 440.

“I think both Bell and Con-
nors have good chances to set
school records in the mile and
the 440,"’ commented Martin.

Other returning sophomores
include Woody VanMeter, who
captured the school record in
the pole vault last season, as
well as Greg Love, David Peaco
and Bob Trumbo, who are all
‘excellent prospects in the 120
and the 440 intermediate hur-
dles,’’ according to Martin.

The schedule for the up-
coming season is one that adds
no more optimism to the outlook
for 1973.

“This is one of the most dif-
ficult schedules that a Davidson
track team has faced in recent
years, explained Martin. ‘‘It
could certainly be a long
spring.”

Commenting on the efforts he
has seen thus far, Martin is
‘‘very well pleased with the
work the boys have done."’
