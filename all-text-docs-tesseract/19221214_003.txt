All But the Shoutin’

To cut a long story short, the fires all gone
but old man Memory sure does work won-

ders. By actual computation of the 550
boys registered, 400 of them fell in love
during Senior Speaking. It's too near
Christmas to indulge in that love-game af-
fair. Still we did have gobs and gobs of
fire, didn't we?
Nose Warmers

Cigarette holders, black ebony ones, or
doggy ones, are barred from Mr: Davidson's
College. It is only fair to warn prospec-
tive givers of gifts to studefts of this col-
lege, that cigarette holders are persona non
grata as gifts this Christmas. Any blind
man on the campus will tell you there is a
plaque of them already. Look at Bob Me-
Leod’s and see for yourself.

Presents That Are Sure to Please
and Bring Results

For Her—Hair nets. ff
For Everyone else ———

Here's one from one of our train nurses
over in the Hornet City.

Ed Fewell, '23, because of long and faith-
ful service, has been promoted from general
supervisor of first floor of Charlotte Sana-
torium to superintendent of the nurse's
home.

Archie Keels seems to think some girls
are queer creatures, but he always manages
to win them by being so very affectionate.

As the vacation “draws near the Parcher
wishes to give its discourse to Freshmen on
Christmas.

1—Treat the family decently the first eve-
ning. You probably won't sce them again
until after first term exams.

2—Dress in the latest style.
angora socks, Persian rag muffler, creased
shoes, penitentiary stripe tic, and let one-
eyed escape from the hat—you might see
something worth while.

3—Let it go around that you “have lived.”
Speak knowingly of Queens and casually
mention that you've sworn off of Volstead
until June.

4—TRe sure to tell her all about the foot-
hall team and your personal conversation
with the coach and captain before the V.
P. 1. game.

5—Neck every chance you get.

No garters,

If the girl
protests, tell her you forgot she wasn’t used
to college men.

6—At the dinner party start up all the
risque songs you learned at college.

7—Catch the last train back to Davidson
and spend the first week recuperating.

&—Be sure and tell all your chance ac-
quaintances how the women fell for
and how many parties on which you were
the guest of honor.

Too Bad

The weather last week was pretty bad. We
don’t know whether it was Monday or Tues-
day, but it was pretty bad. Sometimes it is
pretty bad and again it is pretty bad. Usually
it is pretty bad.

Merry Christmas

Real seriously the Parcher wishes every
student a very Merry Christmas and a Hap-
py New Year. Come back after the vaca-
tion determined to make better grades by
lesser work. Here's hoping Santa Claus will
be good to you and not like the girl who
asked Santa to fill her stocking and he did.
He brought her a lead pencil.

CHRISTMAS ABSENCE
REGULATIONS ISSUED

The faculty has decided to eliminate the
usual drifting away from college several
days previous to the holidays allowed for
Christmas. It has been the practice hereto
fore for the boys to begin to leave the hill

any time during the week preceding the regu-
lar holidays.
who have

However, this year only those
been regular in attendance, or
those who are excused because of sickness,
will be allowed to leave before the holidays
begin.

The executive committee has decided that |

no excuses from home willbe honored for
absences prior to the last period on \Wednes-
day, December 20th, All absences previous
to that time will be recorded as unexcused
absences, and will follow the route of unex
cused absences as is preseribed in the regu:
Jar absence regulations of the college.

There is to be but one way to have ab-
sences excused and that is by the permission
of Doctor MacConnell. | Sickness is the only
excuse that will be accepted undér any cir-
cumstances. This rule has been passed to
prevent those who have been irregular dur-
ing the fall term from piling up their unex-
cused absences by leaving before the regu-
lar holidays start.

tain industrious and curious persons that the
primary cause of all the open windows upon
the campus can at least be laid at the door
of the new distributor of that phase of
physics which the professors are wont to
call a form of energy consisting of molecu-
lar motion. These aforementioned persons
deserve all credit possible for their investi-
gation and analysis of such an interesting
situation,

There are many ands various kinds of sen
sations, but the greatest one experienced in
the history of dormitory life is that of twist-
ing the steam valve handle and hearing the
rush of energy as it writhes and rumbles in

Yea, truly, there is no more pleasing sensa-
tion to the minds of many. It carries one
back to those good old days when one could
prop his number tens up in front of the best
grate in Chambers and look anyone
square in the face and say “bring ‘em on.”

It is with the greatest and deepest sorrow
on the part of the worshippers at the Shrine

such is life. Soon their sorrows will be
forgotten and they will revel in the joys of
this efficient stranger in our midst which is
serving its worshippers in such a laudable
manner.

It is to be hoped that all mechanical ser-

Bill—Say, where's: the poem?

Mack—Don't know.

Bill—What do you know ?

Mack—Everything I don't know.

Bill—That’s everything.

Mack—So.

Bill—Even_ so.

Mack—I'll say that Mellon has the Christ-

Bill—And we'll let it go at that.

Both of them—Merry Christmas
Happy New Year.
