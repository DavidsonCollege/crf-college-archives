Board of Trustees discuss
evolving role of Church

ExecutiveCommittee |
to examine trustee

religion requirement

By AMEE PATEL
Managing Editor

The Board of Trustees held a re-
treat two weekends ago in Charlotte
to explore “What it means to be a
church-related college in the Re-
formed Tradition.”

While no formal discussion took
place regarding the trustee religion
requirement, the executive commit-
tee of the Board was asked to look
into the issue in greater detail and
report their findings to the full Board
in future meetings.

John McCartney ’74, Chairman of
the Board of Trustees, said the retreat
provided an important background
on Davidson’s Christian tradition.

“The principle.objective was to
establish a broad understanding of
history and the relationship with the
Church,” McCartney said.

By Lesiize HEMPSON
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson’s Board of Trustees ap-
proved the promotion of five fac-
ulty members to full professor sta-
tus at atime when the Collegeis also
in the process of interviewing can-
didates for open positions in five de-
partments.

The professors who received the
promotions are Jonathan Berkey of
the History department, Ann Marie
Costa of the Theatre department,

Scott Denham of the German de- ©

partment, Vikram Kumar of the
Economics department, and Ken
Menkhaus of the Political Science
department.

According to Clark Ross, Dean

Have you been
following the
primaries?

Academic Affairs, only the Board
of Trustees can approve professor
promotions.

Although there is no official point
at which professors become eligible
for promotion, Ross said that most
faculty members are not considered
until roughly seven years after they
gained tenure.

Candidates must submit letters of
recommendation from former stu-
dents and full professors in their'de-
partmentto Ross before they can be
considered for promotion.

Ross also solicits the opinion of
experts in the candidates’ field be-
fore asking President Vagt toreview
the names. The Board of Trustees
makes the final decision but gener-

_ally approves the administration’s

College notified
about illegal uploads

Copyrighted material taken from
Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures

By SARAH-GRACE WESLEY
News Editor

Within the past week, the College
has received two notifications from
Universal Studios and Paramount
Pictures regarding copyrighted ma-
terial being distributed onto the
Internet from computers at Davidson.

The Director of ITS, John Casey,
said that while downloading music
and movies is a problem, the recent
complaints specifically address the
uploading of movies on campus.

The administration has located the |

offender, whose Internet access will
be discontinued until the files are
removed, but Casey is still concerned
that “we’ll see many more com-
plaints now because Davidson Col-
lege is in the spotlight and has been
noticed.”

Ina letter to the student body, Vice

. President for Student Life and Dean

of Students Tom Shandley com-

-menitted on the fact that illegal upload-

ing directly violates the United States
Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
He noted that the administration will
be discussing a new policy for the

College in response to this growing
national issue.

Shandley also mentioned the de-
cision to have a panel this semester,
hopefully composed of “an entertain-
ment attorney, an economist, an
musician, and a legal expert on copy-
right law,” that will discuss the legal
and ethical issues surrounding
Internet music and movie down-
loads.

“One of the purposes of organiz-
ing this forum for the spring is to
bring in a variety of opinions and
perspectives on this issue to inform
both the campus and the commu-
nity,” Shandley said.

He also addressed the fact that “we
are certainly one of a number of
schools” currently faced with this
issue.

Penn State recently purchased the
right to download music on campus.
According to Shandley, he has con-
tacted the university regarding the
expense and success of the system
that is aimed at keeping students from
downloading music illegally.
Shandley did not indicate any plans
for Davidson to follow Penn’s lead.
