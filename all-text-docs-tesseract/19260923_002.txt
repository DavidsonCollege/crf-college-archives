week, suffered severely by graduation of a

last Saturday. That would indicate that the
Methodists have a strong line, and this, in
contrast with the Wildcats’ front wall, ad-
mittedly the weakest in several years, does
not sound any too encouraging for Davidson.

Real Test for Wildcats
to Come This Saturday
in Battle With Wofford

South Carolina Methodists to be
Played in Spartanburg—Teams
Ancient Rivals

A real test will be given the Wildcat eleven

in reality the game was much closer than
the score indicated.

Coach Monk Younger, the Wildcat mentor,
has been driving his charges with vim and
vigor this week. He admitted that the team
showed up very well against Elon with the
exception of the second quarter, but added
that the Wofford eleven would be a hard nut
to crack.

The Davidson line-up will be about the
same as last Saturday’s. Charlie Harrison
will play halfback. It hoped Harry
Goodykoontz, who strained a ligament in
practice last week, will be able to break in
the game.

About 30 men will make the trip by bus,
leaving either Friday afternoon or Saturday
morning. The game will be played on the
Wofford College athletic field.

The most likely looking man from the Fresh-
man team is Ratchford, of Gastonia, a fielder.
The*team will be hard up this year for
pitchers.

In track the prospects do not seem much
better. Anderson, Williford, and Penn are
missing, from the team of last year, but sev-
eral men from the Freshman squad are
expected to win places on the tearn, Captain
Goodykoontz hopes to escape the jinx that
has hung over our track captains for the last
few years, but has made a bad start by get-
ting an injured ankle in football practice.
It is rumored that John Currie will be back
in-college after the first semester, and he will

greatly strengthen the squad.
