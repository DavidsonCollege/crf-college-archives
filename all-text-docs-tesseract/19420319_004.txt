Interfraternity Track

Sports highlight of the week will be the annual interfra-
ternity track meet which ends today. The meet usually
attended “en masse” by the students who come as much for
the laughs as anything else. [specially pleasing to the upper-
classmen is the sight of an overcontident freshman starting out

is

on a distance run in a cloub of dust expecting to win in a
breeze and collapse on the second turn. Last year’s meet
was practically a dual match between the Nappa Sigs and

the K. A.’s with the former finally pulling ahead to win. That
was the year freshman Bill Lacy outshone everybody on the
track and practically won the meet single-handed. Naturally
the question was raised after this whether or not freshmen
trackmen should be allowed to enter the meet, but to keep
the-frosh from deserting the ‘team for this one meet for the
sake_of their fraternity the rule was not changed. This ee
the stipulations for entrance are (1) must not have
single point in either a freshman or varsity track meet, or for
any other school a transfer, (2) must not have in
any pre-season track meet like the Southern Conference
Tournament of a ‘few weeks ago, and (3) must not be out
for any other college sport.

Seniors Lead

Inter-class volley ball is drawing (or may have
drawn by the time of publication) to a close this week
with the nine old men on the Senior’s team still Nade-
feated and they are predicting in-spit-of-a-few-ereak
joints and bald heads, as of Squatty Squires, that
science will win over energy. The Juniors are closely
trailing the leaders with only one loss against them.
They meet the Seniors again this week and may tie
them for top hnors if they can win this return match.
The Sophomores, as seca are fighting but still losing
to every comer although there have been a few close
games.

rounds will be run off in a few days with acting captain Pete
Cavert and Tommy Bumbarger battling it out for the number

practice will start as soon as the courts dry off. John Crich-
ton, this year’s captain, Craig Schmidt, and Gene Sutton are
expected to shine this year sthough the services of last year’s
captain Dick Shore will he sadly missing.
