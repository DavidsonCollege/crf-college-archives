YMCA Shifts Into High Gear
With Renovated Headquarters

By JIM JERNIGAN
Staff Writer

The YMCA hopes to open the
remodeled depot in several
weeks, according to President
Woody Connette.

Most of the $10,000 face-lifting
has been completed: however
a fence still must be erected
between the building and the
tracks as specified by the coen-
tract reached with Southern
Railways.

Although the building will be
ready soon, the actual program
material has yet to be fully
defined.

Basically the depot will be
geared for the community's
children. Saturday morning
movies, elementary art and
craft programs with nominal in-
struction will be part of the for-
mat. Hopefully the tutoring
program will also be expanded.

The YMCA is still looking for
activities geared to the college
student which are not normally
handled by the student Union.

A co-op exchange Is being ex-
plored. This system initially
would provide for the exchange
of clothing, with possibly crafts
and groceries later being  in-
corporated,

The YMCA also hopes to
become active in the com-
munity drive toward improved
health services in the North
Mecklenburg area.

Connette is fully aware of the
need for proper Depot
management. Vandalism is an
obvious potential problem, but
Connette was pleased that
nothing was disturbed while the
building was being recon-
structed.

... Evaluation Plan Released

(Continued from Page 1)

“scholarly development of the
faculty member teaching it.”’

Student participation in the
evaluation process would be
initially through a formal
student evaluation of every
course and professor.

Additionally, any student
wishing to give’ personal
evaluations of faculty members
would be interviewed by the
committee

Alumni would be contacted
three to five vears after
graduation to fill out question-
naires evaluating faculty mem-
bers. and an assessment would
be made of taculty members
contributions to the develop
ment ot departmental library
holdings

Alter a faculty member has
been evaluated. a file of the en-
tire proceedings would be
maintained in the office of the
vice president for academic af-
fairs.

The proposal further states
that ‘The committee shall ad-
vise the president concerning
appointments, reappointments,
terminations, tenure and
promotions.

OPEN HOUSE

There will be an open
house for the entire
college on third and
fourth floor Little on
Friday night from 8-12
p.m. Refreshments
will be served.

‘‘Where the recom-
mendations of the committee
are not followed, the president
shall inform the committee in
writing of the reasons for his
decision.

“The Committee shall advise
the President concerning salary
increases for those professors
being evaluated. Every four
years each faculty member's
salary shall be reviewed by the
Committee.”

Included in the proposed
document is a recommendation
to the Board of Trustees that a
systematic method ot ad
ministrative evaluation be
similarly devised

The CPA suvgested that the
Board institute a committee
composed of Trustees and
faculty members to review and
evaluate at regular intervals
the performance of the college
president, vice president’ for
academic affairs. and vice
president for finance and
development.

As an appendix to the major
plan, a minority report of the
CPA presents an alternative
plan for faculty evaluation
based on the premise that “the
formulation of policy and the
implementation of that policy
should be separated.”

The alternate plan asserts
that faculty evaluation ‘is the
proper administrative function
and responsibility of the
Vice President for Academic
Affairs and correspondingly
of departmenta! chairmen as he
may delegate

Faculty members would be
able to appeal unfavorable

administrative decisions to the
CPA, the plan adds. :

Criteria and procedures of the
two plans are essentially iden-
tical except for the minority
report's replacing the five-
member evaluation committee
with the vice president for
academic affairs and depart-
ment chairmen.

“It's important that the
faculty see this as a clear-cut

issue.” Polley emphasized
“There is some feeling that
faculty members should not

have the responsibility involved
iInevaluation

‘Some teel iw would be an
overwhelming job tor a taculty
member, an administrative job
which should be left to the Ad-
ministration.” he added

Public) discussion of the
working document will for-
mally begin in a meeting of the
faculty next Wednesday.

“In order to begin getting
student involvement = and
opinions, we'll hold an open
meeting on the proposal the
week after it goes to the
faculty,"’ Polley said.

securing the contract. Ino ex-
change for complete respon-
sibility of the building. David-
son agreed to pay $1 per year,
Despite the successtul tund-
raising earlier in the vear, Con-
nelle is hoping that outside
grants will provide the financial

resources needed to run the
depot.

Remodeling costs and the
Symposium on Corrections
have depleted the YMCA
budget

The YMCA is looking for

workers to staff the Depot from
3 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily and to
prepare the various programs.

... Faculty React To Report

(Continued from Page 1)

In addition, the college
enrolls its employees in a group
life insurance plan, and it also
grants $1400 to faculty mem-
bers for each of their children
who attend a college other than
Davidson.

‘‘We should pay more,”
acknowledged Vice President
forr Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, “but this is not always
feasible. Budget dictates; we
can't always give as much of a
raise as we'd like to.

“I am sympathetic to the
complaints of individual faculty
members in particular
situations--the faculty member
with five children and two in
college teels a squeeze. | think
that in terms of salary some are

okay and some are not,”’ he con-
tinued.

Bevan called for perspective
on the issue of Davidson's
having to compete with the
large universities for faculty
members.

“Realistically, the highly
paid people at the large univer-
sities are researchers, not
teachers. It is a fact of life that
the good researcher has always
been paid more than the good
teacher,” he said.

“Also, the fact that the
average full professor at Chapel
Hill makes over $25,000 a year
takes on new meaning when you
realize that this takes into ac-
count medical school and law
school personnel, who are very
highly paid”
