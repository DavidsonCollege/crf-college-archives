in immediate order for two rea-
sons: an undue financial bur-
den might be placed on some
fraternities and there existed the
problem of providing adequate
blem of providing adequate
social life for incoming fresh-
men.

The committee thereby pro-
posed ¢o dstitute a program
whereby a new evaluation com-
mittee could analyze the grad-
ual effects of the two proposed
eating clubs and an alternate
Tush policy for a longer period
of time and be able to take a
more objective look at. the sit-
uation. It still hopes that this
will be the mechanism that is
used during the coming year.

McGavock stated that he be-
lieved that, allowing for a pos-
sible lack of time, his commit-
tee was able to study every
point of view thoroughly. All
opinions of students and alumni
alfke were closely analyzed and
every position was recognized.

“I don't know what else we
(the committee) could possibly
have Gone” to grasp student
opinion, McGavock stated. “All
opportunities were given to a-
llow discussion and presentation
of the various points of view.”

McGavock views the problem
as one of continued analysis
and to which there are no im-

mediate answers.

Haselden said that more than

ers that there is

a railroad crossing about a hundred yards down the road. Boxcars are pushed up close
on either side of the crossing, clouding vision and creating what townspeople call

“the tunnel”

Proceeding cautiously through it, the unsuspecting driver is struck by a freight
car moving through the crossing. There was mo lowered crossing gate, no warning
bell or flashing red light, not even a flagman or a flare to alert. the motorist. The
run itself was an irregular one.

This tye of incident has
occurred twice at that Grif-
fith Road crossing since
Homecoming Weekend, ac-
cording to Mayor F. L. Jack-
son. Other minor accidents
have occurred on the line
between Charlotte and Win-
ston Salem at the rate of
two per year, but these past
two accidents have been the
worst ones, said. the mayor.

As traffic on the road in-
creases and the railroad
steps up its number of runs,
both scheduled and irregu-
lar, the likelihood of fatal
accidents continually
mounts.

coming a man and his wife who

IFC Endorses Report
Of Faculty Committee

By MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor

The Interfraternity Council
passed a resolution ‘strongly
urging adoption of the Mo
Gavock Report’’ after two closed
meetings Thursday afternoon
and evening.

Newly-elected IFC President
Jim Terry described the unani-
mous recommendations of the
Faculty committee as “the
most positive actions for both
the campus and the frater-
nities.”

Two meetings were necessary
in order for the fraternity rep-
resentatives to draw up the
resolution taking a stand on the
McGavock proposals to submit

tive houses for a voie and then
report back to determine the
IFC stand.

Terry hesitated to call the

vote on. the IFC ‘resolution
“unanimous” because of the
indefinite and contingent nature
of some of the proposals in
the McGavock report. But he
Said that a major concern of
sheIFC was to have ‘‘some form
of freshman rush and _ this
'418 included in the McGavock
report.”

Commenting on Wednesday
night's demonstrations, Terry
stared that the IFC did not in
any way sponsor the demonstra-
tions, but he emphasized that
j the council refused to take a
stand either for or against such
: demonstrations.

The new IFC head also ex-
pressed relief at having re-
sponsibility for dance weekends
given to a new campus social
committee.

“We are one of the few IFC's
in the country that have had
the responsibility for planning

campus-wide social functions.
Doing this has been a great

Strain on our shoulders and |
forced us to postpone some of —

our other plans such as the pro
posed drama festival and the
new fraternity scholarship pro-
gram because of the time and
worry involved in planning
dance weekends for the entire
campus.”

Emphasizing again the posi-
itive nature of the McGavock
report compared with other pro-

posals as the big reason for its
IFC endorsement, Terry con-
cluded that the campus-wide so-
c.al committee would enable
the IFC to spend more time on
its principal task:

“We can now be a more ef-
fective Interfraternity Council
in carrying out our main pur.
poses, regulation of relations be-
tween the fraternities them-
Selves and representation of
the Fraternities to the Hill."

He is from Blacksburg. Va.,
and is a transfer from VMI,

The new president anticipates

they passed through ‘the tun-
nel."" Both the man and his wife
were thrown from. the car,
which was completely demo-
lished, and both received minor
injuries.

More recently a Davidson
faculty member was involved
in the accident described in
the opening paragraph. He was
on his way to see the Wildcats
at the Coliseum on Jan. 2. He
escaped personal injury him-
self, but members of his family
were seriously injured, and his
new car was a total loss when
the train finally stopped after
pushing the car about 50 yds.
after impact.

The professar stated that
there was no warning device of
any kind. when he started his
crossing, but that when he
looked back toward the crossing
after the train stopped, flares
had beem ignited and placed
about in: hurried profusion.

He explained also that it was
a coupling of a tank car which
actually struck his car, and
that this tank car was five cars
away from the engine. Because
of the occlusion of the boxcars
the engineer could not see the
road and prevent the accident.

The main problem lies in the
fact that there is no warning
signal and hardly ever a flag-
man to warn motorists when a
train comes through. At present
there are four runs a day
through the town plus other ir-
regular runs. The hazardous
conditions are multiplied by the
greater volume of automobile
‘traffic than when the crossing
was made seven years ago.

Mayor Jackson asked. the
Southern Railway Company
two years ago to install an
electric warning device, but D.

With regard to the present

suggestions from the different
fraternities, to present a report
that will be more acceptable to
the Trustees ‘han the facul-|

ty’s.”” He concluded, ‘Student
dissatisfaction is a good indica-
tion that we don’t intend to
j.ve this fight up.”

it is thus the duty of the High-

He said too that, “A proper
electrical signal for the cross-
ing, including connections and
installation,. would cost at least
$14,000. There may not be
enough funds available when
we teach that project on the
list."’

Dave Powell, Student Council

“all efforts on the part of the
Student Council to rectify the
problem have been unable to
produce any tangible results.
The only way to gain results is

“Emphasis On Effort’

AT OPEN END

Smith Has Enthusiasm

By MIKE MAY

Championship? Unde feated!
Headlines. after basketball sea-
son? No, these are the modest
aims of Head Coach Homer

Smith and the Wildcat fotball
team.

Smith wasn't really quite that
optimistic but at Open End
Wednesday night he certainly
displayed to the audience of
about fifty an air of confidence
whch has heretofore been rare
in Davidson football circles.

Maybe this self-assurance
was just because everybody
laughed at his jokes but he cer-
tainly made the group feel that
the Wildcats’ fortunes are li-
able to take a turn for the bet-
ter in the next few years.

Smith began by outlining a
series of accidents by which
he came to grace our campus.
Tt seem that he had friends in

high places that he didn’t even
know about. Once he arrived,
however, he was impressed.
“Davidson is one of the most
temarkable schools I've ever
seen” he said.

He added that, “We've had
some soccess in recruiting. The
name Davidson sells very
well’” Smith later admitted
that he had encountered some
trouble due 10 Davidson's poor
record in the past.

One of the first things Smith
learned on arriving on campus
was that around here there is
no sport but basketball, and
Lefty is its prophet. He did
come to meet and admire Drie-
sell, and he gave credit to the
latter’s ‘fertile: -mind’' for a
great deal of help.

Smith then outlined spring
practice to date and some plans
for the immediate ftuure. His
evaluation? “We are tremen-
dously encouraged by the en-

thusiasm and willingness to
work. “The whole emphasis is
on effort. Everybody will be a
hitter.” Judging from the pro- .
gram of drills that he de-
scribed, everybody will either
be a hitter or dead.

The seniors on the team
came in for special praise.
Smith said, ‘In every area the
seniors will be leaders."” He
mentioned Steve Smith, Stu
Perry, and Pack Hindsley in
particular.

Then the floor was opened
for questions, as Smith quipped,
“Take a good look at me: I'm
undefeated.” The questioning
Session tanged from offensive
strategy (single spread) to
budget (too small) to uniforms
(new).

He complained about the
lack of embarassing questions
until someone asked him to
predict next year's record. Like
all good coaches he neatly side-
stepped that one.
