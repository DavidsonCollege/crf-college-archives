Soccer team off to good start

By WHIT WILKS

After the first week of the 1988
season, Coach Charlie Slagle’s
squad has amassed a 1-1-1 rec-
ord, as the ‘Cats tied Richmond,

_ defeated Western Kentucky and
lost to Memphis State.

The season began at home last
Wednesday against the highly-
touted Richmond Spiders. The
Cats fell behind in the first half on
a shot from roughly 30 yards out,
and went into the half trailing 1-0.

In the second stanza, UR con-

scheduling rules.

On Saturday, the team played WKU in the
UNCC Invitational. The Hilltoppers tried to
slow the contest down and played a low pres-
sure defensive style. The Cats were bothered
early and found themselves on the short end of
a 1-0 halftime score.

The second half saw a complete turn-
around, as Davidson dominated the tempo
and scored three unanswered goals. WKU cut
the lead to 3-2, but the Cats got another score
to end the threat and earn the 4-2 victory.
Curtis Ott, Tracy Hankins, Rob Ukrop, and
Neco DaSilva were the goal scorers.

tinued to apply pressure but could
not beat goalie Scott Zucker. '
Davidson managed to tie with just
5:19 to play, as Rob Vest scored
on a pass from Ross Saldorini
following a restart.

Both teams had opportunities in
the rest of regulation and in over-
time, but neither could muster a
score and the contest ended ina 1-
1 tie.

Slagle noted that the tie was big
for the team, which had not had
any preseason scrimmages due to

New Column!:

Fitness tips

for the discerning student

By MARK PUCKETT

Are you fit or fat? If you’re fit, this
column will offer tips on how to maintain
or improve your fitness. If you’re fat, you
could radically change your appearance
and self-image.

You may, however, be quite contented
with your beer gut or cottage-cheese
thighs. Fine with me--I’ll see you at the fat
farm in twenty years. All others may con-
tinue to read and heed this sage advice. I
guarantee that you will reap endless bene-
fits.

Most people don’t eat right. Some have
too much sodium (salt) in their diet. Others
eat too much fat (cholesterol, saturated
fats, etc.) and not enough fiber.

In the September issue of Joe Weider’s
Men’s_ Fitness, Bonnie M. Richards,
M.Ed., offers several common-sense steps
that are paramount to good nutrition: 1)
avoid too much fat, sugar, and sodium in
your diet, 2) eat a variety of foods, 3) eat
foods with adequate dietary fiber (fruits,
vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals,
etc.), 4) if you drink alcohol, do it in mod-
eration, and 5) maintain a desirable weight.
Maintaining your weight will come with

IMACtion

proper eating habits and regular exercise.
“But when am I going to find time to

exercise at Davidson College? I have a ten-

page paper, a physics essay, 34,560 pages

’ of Economics to read, blah, blah, yap, yap,

mumbo-jumbo.”

If you evaluate your time properly, I
promise that you can squeeze twenty min-
utes out of your busy, jam-packed schedule
to exercise aerobically--four times a week
for twenty minutes at a time. That’s all.

You can run, walk, bike, swim, roller-
skate, hike, climb stairs or do whatever you
want (I recommend walking and swim-
ming). If you exercise religiously, you will
increase your metabolism and lower your
heart rate.

I know you will feel better. Combined
with good nutrition you lower the risk of
getting such diseases as cancer, heart at-
tacks, hypertension (high blood pressure),
etc.

Next week I will offer tips on basic
weight-lifting technique and food combi-
nations. I will also answer specific ques-
tions on any aspect of fitness that I am
capable of answering. I can be reached
through the paper. °

Flickerball begins with
preseason tournament

By TODD STEPHENSON ©

Intramural action kicked off this week as
the opening flickerball games began on
Wednesday and Thursday. The other fall
intramural sport, indoor soccer, will begin
play next week.

This year’s intramural competition
promises to be as strong as ever. In flicker-
ball, each freshman hall is fielding at least
one team, all the houses have strong teams,
and the faculty will look for a good show-
ing as well. -

Intramural coordinator Larry Sledge
gives one reason why the flickerball com-
petition will be heated: “The field of teams
looks very strong. A big reason is that the
freshmen look like they know what they are
doing, at least from watching them in prac-
tice, and that just adds to the number of
good teams.” staan

In addition to the strength of flickerball
this year, indoor soccer wil be stronger and
more competitive. This fall 25 teams will
be participating, compared to about 15 last
spring. :

Before the flickerball season opened, a
preseason tournament was held. The finals
matched SAE and KA, with SAE winning
a hard-fought 18-9 victory. Also, a referee
clinic was held to help prepare officials for

| the season.

As fall fades into winter and the IMAC
action shifts from the flickerball field to the
basketball court and then to softball in the
spring, one new aspect will be a preseason
tournament for all three sports. These
tournaments will serve as practice and also
as increased competition and fun.

Along with the team sports, there will be
more individual activities this year, includ-
ing golf, racquetball, and tennis tour-
anments. Sledge explained, “This fall
there will be a golf tournament held at one
of the local country clubs. The entry fee
will be 25 dollars, and we will be giving out
a total of 300 to 400 dollars in prize money.

“During the winter, there will be a rac-
quetball tournament divided into A and B
competition levels. This should provide
good matches at both levels.

“Finally, during the spring there will bea
mixed doubles tennis tournament.” :

He added, “There may be an ultimate
[frisbee] tournament, but that is not defi-
nite. It is just a possibility.”

_ With the increased numbers in intramu-
ral sports, all should be more exciting and
competitive.

Questions concerning team membership

Other questions about IMAC should be
addressed to Larry Sledge.

Sunday saw Davidson
fall behind early to a tal-
ented MSU team in the
second day of tournament
play. Neither team could
manage another score and
the Tigers led 1-0 at the
break.

The second half was a
wild one, as just about eve-
rything that could happen
in a soccer game did. Early
in the half, Mike Friedlan-
der got the ‘Cats on the
board and the goalie
ejected all on the same
play.

Davidson could not take

, advantage of the man-up

situation, as MSU scored
off a corner kick to lead 2-
1.

The Tigers added to
their lead when they
scored on a penalty kick
following a handling call
on Ross Saldorini.

Davidson cut the lead in
half when Robert Avinger

scored from in-close after ,

an initial shot from Fried-
lander had been saved.

The game was later tied
on a penalty kick from
Friedlander, and with ten
minutes to play it was
anybody’s game. .

MSU was awarded a
penalty shot when Curtis

_ Ott was whistled for a foul

with seven minutes to go.
The Tigers converted the
shot and added an insur-
ance goal only moments
later to seal the 5-3 win.
