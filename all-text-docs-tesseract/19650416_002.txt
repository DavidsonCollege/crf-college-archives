Hesitation

Although we see the recommen-
dations adopted by the faculty this
week as a move in the right direction,
it seems that professors somehow
landed on the wrong foot before they
stepped out of their three-hour meet-
ing Tuesday.

We indicated in this column one
week ago that any solution to the fra-
ternity problem was going to require
“mortar with real subtance.” This is
not what the faculty came out with.
Instead we now have a weak thing full
of “lumps” which would only compli-
cate any lasting solution to a full so-
cial life for each Davidson student.

Measures adopted by the faculty
this week do indicate a trend toward
satisfying this goal; nevertheless, it
appears that the real and deeper prob-
lems of rejection and anti-intellectu-
alism which are so much a part of the
Davidson Greek system were never
touched.

This is where the faculty shirked
their responsibilities on Tuesday. It is
an old saw, but “they couldn’t see the
forest for the trees.”

The Interfraternity Council last
night passed a resolution endorsing
the faculty (McGavock) committee re-
port. Seeing a change in their exclu-
sive system as inevitable, the frater-
nity representatives are at the most
grabbing for the mildest-sounding
proposal for them.

Unless a terrific metamorphosis
comes about over the summer months,
we cannot picture the Davidson fra-
ternity man remaining on campus for
five weekends next fall merely to hold
rush parties for freshmen. Yet the IFC
supports such an idea in the McGav-
ock report.

Furthermore, many somehow claim
that the faculty recommendations do
not provide for an adequate freshman
social life. Yet the McGavock com-
mittee report does not. make provi-
sions for the first two months of the
freshman’s stay—definitely the most
critical period for adjustment to all-
around campus life.

The added inconvenience of con-
flicts with first semester holidays and
examination periods make the faculty
committee’s rush procedure wholly
impractical.

The $100,000 risk of building two
new structures on Patterson Court for
non-selective eating clubs is just that:
a mighty expensive stab in the dark.
A non-competitive system cannot be
maintained alongside the stigmas of
rejection and exclusiveness plus the
prevailing attitude of anti-intellectu-
alism on Patterson Court. The battle
is lost there before we begin.

“Separate but equal facilities” are
bygones in the 1960's. Why must Da-
vidson experiment with such an idea?

Tuesday's faculty action has elim-
inated the preposterous rush proce-
dure; but the faculty committee’s
gamble on the fledgling non-selective
houses among the 12 giants, which
was approved by the entire faculty
Tuesday, is still a possibility depend-
ing on trustee reaction later this

‘ month.

The moratorium on pledging ap-
pears to be the most practical solu-
tion to the problem at hand. The pro-
visions for an adequate social life for
the freshmen’s first few months on
campus must be made under the Mc-
Gavock proposal as well as under the

faculty's decision.

There is no difference in this re-
spect between the McGavock report
and the eventual action taken by the
faculty. Nevertheless, the complicat-
ed mid-semester rush would surely
antagonize the freshman’s social ad-
justment at the time most freshmen
are struggling with academic prob-
lems that usually accompany their
first official grade reports.

Also, the provision for allowing
freshmen to have cars on the campus
should greatly relieve many of the
disadvantages that some now have.

We urge the establishment of the
Social Life Evaluating Committee by
the President as soon as possible to
make other necessary provisions for
an adequate social life for freshmen,
as well as to begin the committee’s
other roles as outlined in the faculty
action.

Overall, we cannot help but be
pleased that some action was taken by
the faculty. The recommendations are
long overdue. We only hope that Tues-
day’s action indicates a much greater
concern on the Hill in the future for
a complete and equitable social life
for every student at Davidson.

Ah, Spring!

Davidson’s notoriously apathetic
student body removed their shackles
for approximately one hour Wednes-
day night in a misguided, if not ill-
conceived, demonstration of “student
concern over the faculty action Tues-

ay.’

With the sap rising and leaves
budding around them, the pathos-fill-
ed demonstrators showed us_ that
spring is finally here — but hardly
anything else.

It is rather ironic that nearly ev-
ery Davidson student deplores the re-
cent reappearance of Ku Klux Klan
activity in the South. Yet under the
light of burning broomsticks, flaming
crosses and the cowardly cover of
darkness, several hundred of these
same Davidson “gentlemen” circled.
the campus “just to raise a little hell.”

One might have thought that the
state grand dragon himself had come
over from Granite Quarry to set up
the foolhardy activities.

THE DAVIDSONIAN supports
demonstrations of genuine student
concern, even if we do not necessarily
agree with the ultimate aims. But
Wednesday night’s deplorable situa-
tion was more concerned with “blow-
ing off steam”, than with presenting
any constructive ideas.

Hardly any of the student partici-
pants obviously had even read the
McGavock committee report; for out
of the same mouths Wednesday night
came support of the McGavock pro-
posals and disapproval—in varying
degrees— of the social club idea and
the “fewer than 40” rule.

As President D. Grier Martin told
the gathering on the steps of Cham-
bers Wednesday night, “Davidson Col-
lege will- not be forced -in this man-
ner to take any action.”

We admonish future demonstra-
tors to show just cause for their ac-
tions.

A New Leader

Thursday’s chapel episode was a
comedy of sorts. But beneath the fac-
ade of heckling students, who seem to
have had their share of thrills in the
past few weeks, there lies a real ques-
tion of ethics om the part of one fac-
ulty member.

‘We do not dispute this one partic-

ular professor’s right to. advise stu-.

derits on‘a certain course of action.
But to appeal to the entire student
body for organized opposition against
a faculty decision is both unwise and
professionally unethical.

It was a shrewd and polished ap-
peal before an emotion-filled audi-
ence, who soon gathered that the fac-
ulty’s decision did not quite suit this
professor's cup of tea.

Several faculty members expressed
genuine disapproval of the speaker’s
remarks to the students. Included
were some frofessors who reportedly
voting his speaker in the faculty

The professor is overstepping hi
authoritative bounds when’ he alls
for student action to reverse the deci-
sion of his own colleagues. Such an
appeal is for a new student bureauc-
acy, for which we do not feel -
son is quite ready. David

THE EDITOR

Coffey CondemnsReport
As Piecemeal Solution

Dear Editor:

In a solemn and tense session
on this past Tuesday the fac-
ulty met to decide the fate of
the fraternities. I fully realize
that the question under con-
sideration was not an easy one
to solve. There was consider-
able student and alumni pres-
sure to consider, and, more-
over, the faculty itself was se-
verely divided on the question.

Conceding the complexity of
the problem which the faculty
faced, I still believe that the
compromise solution enacted
was no solution at all.

A piecemeal selection of the
less objectionable proposals
contained in the majority te-
port of the Fraternity Study
Committee, the minority report
of that. same group, and the
report of the faculty Social Life
Committee did not, and indeed
could not have resulted in a
unified and compatible social
program.

The basic social problem at
Davidson will still exist—some
students will be excluded from
the social opportunities the fra-
ternity system offers — and,
moreover, the twelve existing
fraternal organizations will be
severely crippled and may die
of slow financial strangulation.

The faculty has in effect
forced every entering student
to be an Independent for a
year. The fraternities will find
themselves hurting for revenue
and unless they wise up and
take in some students they
would ordinarily have rejected.
which somehow does no: seem
likely, they will at least find

it necessary to curtail their

current social programs and at
worst be forced to disband en-
tirely.

The Independent under ‘the
new system will find his siu-
ation relatively unchanged.
Granted, there will be more in-
dependents, 250 more to be ex-
act, but all this can give the
upperclass independent is a
sort of sadistic vengeance. The
two new “social clubs’ which
will be established as consola-
tion prizes will probably never
work.

At best they can be only two
small Unions or two Lingle Ma-
nors with boarding privilegeS.
Neither the Union nor Lingle
Manor has been able to satisfy
the social needs of the Inde-
pendents and there is no reason
to believe that these new ‘‘so-
cial olubs” will do much bet-
ter.

The faculty also banned dis-
criminatory clauses from the
bylaws of those fraternities
which still have them. Even
the faculty must realize that
this action will not amount to a
hill of beans as long as unani-
mous or even majority approv-
al is necessary before a bid is
extended.

I dare say that for years to
come there will be at least one
member of each fraternity who
will ‘“‘ball" anyone who is not
a white, Anglo-Saxon Protes-
tant. Although some Jewish
students have been accepted by
the fraternities, I don’t believe
a Negro student will have much
of a chance.

The basic weakness of the
faculty decision was that it
failed to consider the fraternity
question in its larger context
as a social prbolem. A com-
plete solution will never be
achieved until every student
who desires to participate in
the off-campus social life is
permitted to do so either by a
system of social affiliation with
the existing fraternities or
through the replacement of the
fraternities by eating clubs
with open memberships.

The only other solution would
be to bring the social Hfe back
on campus where it wolud be

accessible to everyone. But to
be satisfactory to a majority of
the students, this would neces-
sitate the abandonment of- cer-
tain of Davidson College’s sac-
rosanct mores, for example,
the drinking rule.

In summation, I believe that
the faculty should allow the
present system to continue,
even with its obvious defects,
if they are unwilling to exam-
ine the entire social problem
and make the necessary
changes to alleviate it. A piece-
meal compromise is not
erlough. The faculty decision if
allowed to stand may prove dis-
astrous.

Dear Editor:

Davidson College is far from
a perfect place. There are
probably few people who would
be unwilling to criticize it in
any way. However, it seems to
me that the DAVIDSONIAN’S
columnist has carried his criti-
cism somewhat beyond the
limits of sound reason in the
‘“Asterisk’’ column of the issue
of April 9.

Mr. Carson has made some
valid points, Admittedly, the
college's tddservative, Presby-
terian background is a barrier
to complete intellectual free-
dom on the campus. Compul-
sory chapel and vespers have
not made Christianity any
more meaningful to me, and
the faculty oath seems some-
what similar to the gag law,
which a majority of the David-
son faculty opposes.

However, progress is being
made, as attested to by the
achievements of the past three
years — a liberalized cut sys-
tem for classes, the new ves-
pers attendance rule, and the
liberalization of the drinking
rule. And yet, Mr. Carson
claims , that “Davidson con-
tinues to strengthen its ties
with the past.”

Our columnist next proceeds
to castigate the _ admissions
committee and the student
body. According to Mr. Car-
son, the admissions commilt-
tee is concerned with nothing
besides the academic quality
of its applicants. The success
of the tennis, soccer, and track
teams all composed of non-
scholarship athletes), and the
quality of the Wind Ensemble,
the debate team, and the Male
Chorus raise considerable
doubt as to the accuracy of Mr.
Carson's statement.

He is concerned that there is
no Bohemian element on the
campus, and places blame on
the admissions committee. I
do not have any statistics (and
1 suspect that Mr. Carson was
in the same situation), but it
would be interesting to know
how many “Bohemians” are in-
terested enough in hard work
to apply to Davidson.

The curriculum is the next
area to feel'the sting of Mr.
Carson's pen. Lamenting the
absence of certain courses, he
then criticizes the small size
of several departments in the
college. Seemingly, then, it
would do no good for the col-
lege to institute courses in Chi-
nese, for example, without hir-
ing several professors to teach
them.

Perhaps Mr. Carson wishes
for Davidson to become a uni-
versity (another branch of
UNC, perhaps?). We would
have to swap the faculty oath
for the gag law, but maybe
we could discatd Davidson's
reputation and possibly even
attract some Bohemians!

Mr. Carson seems ¢o have

jost sight of the fact that Da-
vidson is a small, liberal arts
college. Its faculty is probably
unsurpassed by any (other) col-
lege in the South. The physi-
cal plant is continually being
improved. New courses are in-
troduced almost every year.

These facts, together with the
record of Davidson men after
graduation, indicate to me that
a Davidson education is some-
thing more than ‘unabashed
deception of the educational
community and self-deception.’’

It appears to me that those
who are so ready to heap se-
vere criticism on the college
would do well to investigate the
bases of their criticisms more
thoroughly.

Dear Editor:

€very Davidson student who
is physically capable is re-
quired to enter the ROTC pro-
gram for two years. There
must be some reason for this.

Surely the administration
does not consider ROTC an in-
tegral part of a liberal educa-
tion. Since Davidson Is a lib-
eral arts college, the adminis-
tration is justified in requiring
all students to take English,
Bible, etc.; indeed. these sub-
jects make up a liberal educa-
tion. But ROTC—never!

Perhaps the college feels that
all students must enter the pro-
gram for two years in order
to determine whether they
want to go into the advanced
course. Surely some type of
orientation program for the in-
coming freshmen wolud serve
the same purpose without sub-
jecting those students who do
not wish to to enter the ad-
vanced program to two years
of ROTC.

Perhaps the college feels
that there is some _ intrinsic
worth in taking two years of
the program. Indeed, the stu-
dent who participates in the
program for only two years
gets no commission when, and
if, he enters the army; there
are no tangible benefits to the
two year program.

Certainly such assorted top-
ics as reading military maps,
tactics, organization of the
army, etc., are of no practical
value to any student who is not
planning to enter the advanced
program. ROTC is not that in-
teresting: it is certainly not in-
tellectually stimulating. I can
see no value, from an educa-
tional point of view, in requir-
ing all students to enter the
program for two years.

I feel that it is about time
for Davidson to re-evaluate its
policy concerning the ROTC de-
partment, or to explain to those
of us who see no value in a

two year program the reason--

it has for requiring us to take
it.

By MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor

“There is not justification with which Davidson
College can salve its conscience. The stagnant waters
of this institution are growing mossy and rockbound,
soon to be inpenetrable’—A Recent Critic’s Flowery
Finale.

THE LACK OF INTELLECTUAL EXCITEMENT,
stimulation or whatever one terms it, at Davidson
College, is finally traceable to one source—the indi-
vidual Davidson student. I'm not at all convinced that
the endless student comment about trustees and ad
missions policies and faculty oaths even comes close
to the essence of educational process—the response
of the individual student.

What is Davidson College after all? Strip it of
facilities, administrative staff, trustees and tradition
and still the items that make it a college remain:
individual students (not a sum of class and attend-
ance figures). And what else is finally important here
except the developing intellectual response of the
individual student?

Gentlemen, the alpha and omega of any educa-
tional institution should be to provide a place where
the individual can educate himself. Note the mood
of that last comment. Perhaps part of the confusion
comes in thinking of college as a place where one
“receives an education” or “gets educated”.

No first-class mind ever “got” an education—he
developed his mind himself. Education is primarily
an individual endeavor, a process in which the stu-
dent is both initiator and terminator. The creative,
first-class mind that is the leading subject of the
educational process is not “educated” at a place or
by a course or a series of courses.

And it is time to face some unfortunate details:
only a very few are ever going to develop a first-
class mind—and not necessarily because of a lack
of mental equipment. Even given the best facilities
and faculty possible, only a handful out of any
thousand ever admitted to Davidson will go beyond
what is “advanced spoon-feeding.”

The problem at Davidson is first a lack of indi-
vidual desire and self-discipline, then one of facili-
ties and other matters. So what is Davidson or any
educational institution to do? It must cater to the
majority of unweaned minds that are there, prod-
ding them and trying to awaken the dormant desire
to achieve in some small way in the second-class
minds—because the creative handful of first-class
minds will take care of themselves. '

Yes, the handful will take care of themselves.
A man who has the will to create and to jearn tends
to create and to learn, despite the barriers in his
path. This sort of man realizes many of his own in-
tellectual gaps and seeks to fill them, on his own
volition, on his own time. And the first-class mind is
rarely classifiable in terms of ‘good guy” or “flit”
or “jock” or “spastic”.

The tragedy is that the second-class minds are
rarely able to discern their inadequacies or do any-
thing to redevelop their unused minds. Merely say-
ing that the purpose of education is “to learn to
think” is not enough—thought requires material
about which to think.

__If material in the course is poor, the superior
student will automatically go beyond the class ma-
terial, instead of merely bewailing poor courses.
If his library is inadequate, the superior student will
go other places to get the materials he needs, in-
stead of only complaining about the poor library
and the administration. And if he finds that pre-
vailing socio-economic levels stifle his educational
development, he will raise the relevant questions
involved, instead of merely blaming the admissions
committee.

There is nothing new in this—these have been
characteristics of first class minds all through the
centuries. ‘

Facilities, like administrative staffs and boards
of trustees and lavatories, are important because
they contribute to the ease as difficulty in education-
al process. But the intellectual growth must go on
inside the individual; it cannot be injected. Facilities
are legitimate topics of discussion, but they cannot
be cover-ups.

I think the main problem at Davidson, at Am-
herst, at everywhere I've visited is that the vast ma-
jority of students lack the desire to create or the
discipline to achieve their goals. If the student acts,
then everything else from sheer momentum will
have to give way. But the college will probably al-
ways have to keep on spoon-feeding the vast ma-
jority of students.

“Salve its conscience?” I’m not sure how much
“Davidson College” needs the balm at all, but there
are certainly many students who “salve their own
consciences” by ignoring the central problem of
desire and self-discipline in themselves.

Waldon Supports Greeks

Dear Editor:

Having discussed the matter
about which I write with a few
other students, I find, 40 my
amazement, that in some of
their views it is not a valid
analogy at all. Nevertheless it
seems to me to bear a rather
accurate similarity, and it is
in this manner that 1 should
like to offer it.

It appears to me that there
is really very ttle difference
between the right, or lack of

right,

for the legislature of

North Carolina to ban certain
speakers: from. their college
campuses, or for the Trustees
of Davidson College to prohibit
men from teaching here on the
basis of their views on what
they might say, and the right
of the Faculty of Davidson Col-
lege to restrict fraternities to
a point which will probably
mean their forced dissolution.

It has been my understanding
that the faculty has been fight-
ing for academic freedom,
which in the case of the gag

law is simply freedom of
speech and in the case of the
oath is both freedom of speech
and freedom of religion. Simi-
larly, I believe that the ques-
tion of fraternities involves, in
a large measure, the right of
the student body ‘peaceably to
assemble.”

I truthfully cannot see how
the faculty can oppose the first
restrictions and then advocate
the other.
