was:

Although students are
usually nervous when they first
come. it is really good to talk
with semeone and to help to
broaden their self-awareness,
wiew options and recognize
limitations," said Hall.

Hall pointed out that society
has tended to view someone
seeking professional help as an
individual who is falling apart
or who is going to pieces. but
this is not true.

“| want to get away from the
image that I am treating a mind
sickness. All of us experience a
sense of being deeply unhappy
at some time and it is a disser-
“ice for people who are older to
say they have got it all
together.” said Hall.

As well as working with
people who are seeking to un-
derstand themselves. Hall has
spent some time working with
SGA senators dealing with their
sensitivities and concerns.

One of the questions that Hall
1s frequently asked is what are
‘the unique problems of students
at Davidson College. He
stressed that the problems of
Dav idson are not umque

“One problem that people
irequently bring to my attention
1s the competition at Davidson.
Some feel that they are judged
bv how know ledgeable they are,

and that a person becomes
more valuable tbe more
knowledgeable he is. said
Hall.

Although more competition
exists at Davidsan then at some
campuses; Hall explained that
this competition is present to
lesser or greater degrees on
other colleges.

Another concern that Hall
recognizes is the need for a per-
sonal realtionship between in-
structors and students bevond
the intellectual exchange. This
also is not a problem unique to
Davidson

Hall feels there are a number
of people here who care about
the students as people. but he
feels there is room for im-

provement in this. and in
relations between ad-
Ministrators. faculty and
students.

“There is a lack = of
willingness among Davidson
people to compliment each
other. both among students.
faculty and administrators
This may be part of the
dominant male attitude that
you don’t tell people vou really
like them.”: said Hall

“1 don't just look at Davidson
as a pathological situation It 1s
really a pretty place to come
and walk around
