Onychophagia Ravages Community )

Like a thief in the night, one
of the most insidious menaces
to life and happiness existing
in: the world today has crept
onto the Davidson campus.

The Nov. 1 issue of the
‘Journal for the
Dissemination of the Findings
of the Center for

omenological Research”
indicated conclusively that an
which chas
simultaneously stymied and
revolted modern medical
science is not sitnply existent
here, but is indeed epidemic.

That to which I refer is, of

course, ony’

Yes, this syndrome ‘capable
of undermining the stamina of
the most virile spécimens of
American manhood has
struck.

So even Davidson is not im-

by all sentient beings.
While statistics show that
. two out of every three persons
in society at large are
knowingly or unknowingly vic-
tims of onychophagia, there is
no cause for panic.

“Concerted effort may ‘cur-
tail the syndrome before it
reaches cataclysmic dimensi-
ons at Davidson College. To
prevent contagion, it is essen-
tial to avoid contact with those
manifesting overt onycho-
phagia tendencies.

Symptoms are Fo ahernae ¢

best described in the ‘“‘Morck

seanual ” Sufferers may “‘ap-

pear tense .and repeatedly
- ingest keratinous materials.”

As to those in terminal
onychophagia, _ palliative
treatment is the only recour-
se. The need for un-
derstanding must be stressed, '
however. Onychophagists
should be viewed with no more
Reackaiine that victims of

other illnesses contracted ac-
cidentally during normal
human interaction. Though
the manifestations of the con-
dition may inspire disgust,
kindness is the better part of
virtue.

Thus for the present, we
must hope that’ medical in-
novation __ will
onychophagists with a per-
manent cure. Today, intensive
psychological co
may result in temporary
remissions, but a definitive
cure must remain among the
highest priorities of medical
research. .

A strict system of quaran-
tine in conjunction with triage
for those affected seems to be
the only viable course of ac-
tion. Since the onslaught of the
syndrome has not even

spurred those in the higher ac

ministrative echelons, ours _is.

under the rug.
We must act and act now.
