_ Israelis thwart Sadat peace move

'The'véry audacity of Sadat’s act,

and downs are inevitable in the

fated themselves to success.”

Those are the

magazine, which made Sadat their

Man of the Year. I
deserves, after h

position, his reputation, and his life;
the latter will remain in peril until his
last day. The cause--a worthwhile

one--peace, and the

if unchecked, could lead to a major
confrontation or Third World War,
meaning utter destruction.

AU Unis puint, nowever,, it. seems
that Israel is reacting very .poorly to
his initiative. In fact, the talks are at
a perilous and ominous standstill on
freshly arising problems such as the

increasing number
the Sinai.

NO
These are capricious and.obstinate
attempts of resistance on the part of a
selfish minority that is not concerned
with the consequences. They only
seek to fulfill their avidity at the risk
of blocking the peace negotiations and
enhancing the already present ‘scorn

of the radical hardline rejectionist
front that won’t hesitate to take rash

action against the

intended peace talks.

A closer look at the question of
settlements indicates an obvious
weakness in some Israeli officials.

They are afraid

positions and power by facing the
angry settlers, who claim they are
historically attached ‘‘to the Sinai.’’
Historically attached? It is somehow
hard to believe how people can be
“historically attached” to a barren
desert that has very little, if any, sign
of history at all. Yet after a maximun
period of ten years they become
“historically attached!’’ Bear in mind
that the Arabs conquered Spain and
have lived there for 800. years--yet
they still do not claim ‘‘historical
attachment” to Cordova, Alhambra

and Madrid.

The second and most grave issue is
that of the Palestinians. Historically
the ‘ralestimans were the .Mosiem,
Christian, and Jewish Atabs‘living on
the strip of land called Palestine. In
1948 three million Christian and
Moslem Palestinians were driven out
of their homeland. They were terror-
ized and doomed to be refugees, living
in tents, covered by rags, and banned
from returning to their land. The
Zionist movement, whose roots had
started in the late 19th century and
early 20th century, had taken over. -

One must not confuse Zionists with
Jews. Judaism, like Christianity, is a
religion respected by the Arab majo-
rity. Everywhere in the Arab world
there are Moslem, Christian, and
Jewish Arabs. The Zionist expansion,
on the other hand, was that the
Jewish Arab minority should rule
based on the fact that over 2000 years
before there had existed a Jewish
state (that had not existed more than
90 years). They embarked on wide
scale. plans to wipe off the present
inhabitants and establish what is now
known as the state of Israel.

The Zionists pushed forth the idea
of ‘‘God’s chosen race,” which was,
ironically enough, an equivalent to
Hitler's master. race and which, in
many ways adopted the same grue-
some techniques in achieving their
end. Volumes can be filled with the
atrocities and massacres that have
taken place, of which very few have
reached the West.

As Moshe Dayan sublty pointed
out when he,addressed the Israeli
Technological! Institute in April 1969:
“We came to this country which was
already populated by Arabs, and we
are establishing a Hebrew, a Jewish
state here. In considerable areas of
the country we bought the land from
the Arabs. Jewish villages were built
in the place of Arab villages. You do
not even know the names of these
Arab villages and I don’t blame you,
since those geography books no
longer exist. Not only do the books
not exist--the Arab villagers are not
there either.”’ (ha’ aretz, April 4,

The latest massacre was 100 Leba-
‘nese civilians killed in retaliation for

ad

the deaths of three Israeli civilians.
“An eye for a tooth!’' reported
Newsweek.' .

Most people in the West know very
little about the truth of the Middle
East issue, except for what they are
exposed to in the pra-Zionist and
Jewish controlled mass media. The
media tries to project the Jews in an
image of being persecuted in order to
induce pity. In fact it is this image
that the Jews are persectued that has
drawn world opinion to their side.
¢ Does one have to listen to such
Israeli threats of launching a war that
shall mobilize the armies of the
Middle East years? (Charlotte Obser-
ver, October 27, 1977.) Or does one

.. Davidson’s academic environment,

‘iy many ways, is weathering these
difficult economic times rather well.
Our faculty is energetic and concern-
ed, compared to most, and is almost
as active and vital in extracurriculars
as the students themselves. Our
student body, despite. the self-cen-
teredness that a bleak job market
encourages, is remarkably involved.
Look at CROP, our prison and
education programs, DCF work pro-
jects, PIRG.

With such a wonderful atmosphere,
an outsider might ask, why the
unrest, the constant state of dissatis-
faction with the state of affairs here?
Why do faculty members voice more
and more frustration over having
their new ideas stifled or ignored, and
why are young teachers like David
Rice getting out ofDavidson? My
speculation is that the answer lies
somewhere in the Administration’s
communication tendencies, with the
nature of the decision-making process
here, and with the values that guide
-it.

In dealing with the Administra-
tion/student relationship, as manager
of WDAV, what first appeared to be a
failure to communicate rapidly proved
to be a profound lack of interest in
communicating on the part of the
administration. Somehow, as a stu-
dent, I found myself getting second
priority. When decisions were made
that had direct import for the station,
for example, .I discovered that just
finding out what the decisions were
could take weeks of frustrating nego-
tiations. Often, when the decisions
were unpopular ones, this lack of
interest_in communicating had the
‘added advantage of saving the ad-
ministration the discomfort of our
incessant protests. Another case in
point might be the 200,000 dollar
remodeling of Carnegie House, duly
conducted over the carefree, student-
less months of the summer of 1976.

I detected a disillusioning lack of
directness and honesty in Adminis-
trative communications. I’m aware
these are strong wotds, but how
would you like to be told that you
cannot take two courses because you
would be a bad influence on your
roommate's study habits? With all
due respect to Dr. Zimmerman, I
frankly do not believe that this is the
reason he adopted the mandatory
three-course policy. ‘In following such

Today the miadl¢ Fast is a highly
explosive area» If President Sadat’s |
initiatives aré not answered, the
possibility of a war or an oil embargo
is very real. Perhaps even a military
intervention from a dying and desper-
ate Europe? A U.S. envolvement and
a Soviet counter attack? A Third
World War? Utter destruction of this
planet!

Maybe it is time for us to-step out
of our conditioned, slanted prejudices
and ideals. Find out more and realize
the dangers. And as the Buddist

issues as WDAV and the college’s
hiring policies, the carefully worded
official’ statements and after-the-fact
rationalizations took on the air of Ron
Ziegler’s press conferences during the
Nixon years. An overstatement? Per-
haps, but why can’t Davidson College
be as frank about its criteria for these
decisions as its faculty and students .
are about their grievances? It’s hardly
a fair deal. 1 otten feel like I am being—
told only what is expedient for me to
hear, in the interest of minimizing the
unpleasant implications that might
prompt complaint. (I certainly hope
Dr. Zimmerman did not unload that

—‘study habit’’ line on President

Spencer while explaining his deci-
sion.)

. I also became aware of a kind of
wall around the Administrative de-
cision-making process. If the unten-
ured teacher situation is any indica-
tion, it seems that the students are
not alone in sensing this aloofness. In
many crucial decisions, such as the
Linden affair, there is often no serious
consideration of student or faculty
sentiment, even in matters which
directly affect our lives here. Possibly
the Administration feels that we
cannot understand the difficulty of
selling Davidson’s image in the small
college scramble for funds, and per-
haps they feel that students’ criti-

_cisms are irresponsible and not to be

worried about too much. While there
may be a grain of truth here, it is not
enought to account for their persis-
tent reluctance to be frank and open.

One reason for this, unfortunately,
may be that the criteria for their
decisions indicate that financial and
public relations concerns have an
undue influence, sometimes more
than academic concerns. This would
be rather difficult to defend in a frank . .
discussion of priorities. I will grant
that the present Administration has
done a remarkable job of attracting
funds to Davidson. But the time and
money spent on Carnegie House,
WDAV?s new transmitter and a
600,000 dollar sports program could
be tempered with some increased
concern for a stifled faculty, a langui-
shing fine arts program, or an
ethnically and racially diversified
faculty and staff. ——-—- _

Such are my discontents, as best I
can track them down. I sense a touch
of the old ‘business as usual’ ethic
operating behind our Administrative
