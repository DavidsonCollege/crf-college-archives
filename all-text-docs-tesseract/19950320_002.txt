Town of Davidson builds new library

By Msc WoLrFF
Staff Writer

The idea to build a new library
arose during a Davidson town
meeting in 1990. At the time,
Davidson had the highest per capita
circulation of any library in the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg system.
After that initial discussion, those
in the library system began to talk
about closing several small, re-
gional libraries.

Fortunately, Davidson was
able to prove that its library de-
served to remain open and moved
toward the construction of a new
library facility.

According to Town Manager
Leamon Brice, the new library is a

three-way partnership between the
college, the town of Davidson, and
the library system. Davidson Col-
lege provided the site for the li-
brary, leasing it to the town for
only $1 a year. The college Physi-
cal Plant is also overseeing the
construction of the library. The
town of Davidson provides the fi-
nancing for the library and will
maintain the lawn. The library
system will reimburse Davidson
for the cost of the building.

Some of the financing will be
provided by Davidson to cover
costs not covered by the library
system. According to Brice, a
fundraising campaign has begun,
and the committee hopes to wind
up its major gifts campaign, or

“naming” gifts campaign, by next °
week. So far $80,000 of the
$136,000 goal has been raised.
Brice says that soon the opportu-
nity to give will be presented to the
community using neighborhood
“captains” to pass out brochures
and pledge cards to heighten com-
munity awareness and interest.
The library is scheduled to be
completed in mid-August, and
Brice hopes the library will be fully
occupied by September. A unique
feature of the library is a stage or

‘large balcony on the front to con-

tribute to the many community fes-
tivities held on the green. The
library also will also have audio-
visual areas, a community room,
and adult and child reading rooms.

Women’s Month brings events for all

By Mary Laura Moretz
Staff Writer

As the month of March con-
tinues, so does a series of events to
celebrate Women’s Month. The
Union Committee for Women’s
Issues and other campus groups,
including BSC and FLAG, have
organized speakers, movies, fo-
rums, and entertainment for all
Davidson students and faculty —
not just women — to attend.
Annual events associated with

Women’s Month will be repeated
this year. On March 27, the 900
Room will host the fifth annual
Sexuality Forum, a candid “every-
thing you ever wanted to know
about sexual orientation but were
afraid to ask” event. Take Back
the Night will occur on March 30,
beginning in the 900 Room and
ending: with a walk through cam-
pus.

Women’s Issues Committee
Chairperson Sarah Orsbon, who
organized most of the activities for

Friends congregate on the patio of the Onion. Oh, College.

Women’s Month, has arranged for
some nationally prominent speak-
ers. Patricia Ireland, President of
NOW, will speak on March 28
about violence against women.
Two events offer the opportu-
nity for discussion of the female
body image. Mimi Weich per-
formed a dramatic comedy on eat-
ing disorders followed by an audi-
ence discussion on March 2.
Davidson psychologist Dr. DeWitt
Crosby and News Intern Sara
Carlson will lead an open discus-

sion on body image and sexuality
on March 23.

Plenty of entertainment will
round out the month. Steel Mag-
nolias will play in the Union. The
ASE Drumming Circle, a women’s
percussion group, will play in the
900 Room March 25.

For art enthusiasts, Maria
Wiatrowski’s paintings will be dis-
played in the Union Gallery
throughout the rest of the month.

For those interested in becom-
ing more involved in the events to

raise awareness of women’s con-
cerns on campus, the Women’s
Issues Committee will hold a pot-
luck dinner March 20 for anyone
interested or hungry.

Letitia Campbell, who worked
with Orsbon in coordinating the
month’s events and will become
the new chairperson, considers the
month “a chance for people, men
and women, to connect over issues
that arerelevanttoeveryone’s lives.
I hope it will inspire a lot of con-’
versation.”

Students try to resurrect WALT

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff Writer

Davidson students enjoy all
types of music from country to
alternative to classical to heavy
metal. Some may find it odd, then,
that the college’s only radio sta-
tion, WDAV, plays only classical
music,

To provide a diversity of mu-
sic, Todd Bowman held an organi-
zational meeting to gauge the in-
terest of forming a student-run al-
ternative radio station called

WALT February 27.

WALT was an actual station
in the 1970s but was pulled off the
air when the rebellious students of
the era were disrespectful of the
administration on the air. From
1979 to 1990, there have been sev-
eral attempts to get the station run-
ning again. However, all have
failed, primarily because of resis-
tance from the offices of the Presi-
dent and Dean of Students.

‘In 1992, a committee of six or
seven students made some

progress. They drew up some by-

“Students from any college or university, teachers, rising high school seniors, and any others who are not enrolled at UNC-CH

may apply as Visiting Summer Students for first, second, or both sessions.
*UNC-CH offers, during two 5 and a half week sessions, over 900 courses in 45 disciplines. A typical course load per session

is 6 semester hours.

Approximate Cost per session: tuition and fees of $125 PLUS $47 per credit hour for NC resident undergaduates or $341 per
credit hour for nonresident undergraduates.

laws and were registered with the
Dean of Students Office.

The Union then approved a
limited amount of funding. But
the WALT committee was unable
to raise the additional funds neces-
sary to bring the station back to
life.

Bowman explained that the
new group of interested students
had a massive amount of technical

“work to do before they could even

begin to discuss the fun things,
such as programming and disk
jockeying.

‘The equipment used by the
first WALT station is very out-
dated, and the wires it ran on are
now rotted because of faulty in-
stallation and of not being used for
the past 20 years.

Anew committee would have
to figure out the logistics of broad-
casting, including whether to use
AM or FM, and what to use as a
power source.

They also would need to come
up with a charter and by-laws for
administrative approval.

Approximately 25 students
attended the organizational meet-
ing, and no additional meetings
have been held since that time.
Attendees’ outlooks ranged from
excited and optimistic to extremely
skeptical.

Junior Churchill Hooff, a
member of the WALT committee,
says, “I think we could get the
station running next year if we can
get organized.”

Afternearly 20 years, the ques-
tion of whether or not such organi-
zation is probable — or even pos-
sible — remains.
