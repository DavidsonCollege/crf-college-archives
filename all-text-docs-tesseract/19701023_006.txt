ed, and the Davidson run-
ning attack had some trou-
ble getting started. ‘‘Their
boys, were also out there

hitting and tackling hard,”’
Mcver stated.

Davidson took an early
lead in the second quarter
at 8-0, but right before the
half Evans scored on a long
pass to tie the game 8-8. The

Cagers Please Holland
In Preliminary Practices

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer.
Coach Terry Holland has
been very pleased with the
first few practice sessions of
the ‘70-71 Wildcat .cagers.
“T am really surprised to
note such marked improve-

ment in so many of, the plays.

ers,’ Holland ° stated. He
specifically noted Eric Min-
lein, John Pecorak,
Duncan - Postma,
Ren _ Stelzer, and ___.Billy
Pierce.

Holland noted Minkin’s
great improvement of his of-
fensive moves along with
terrific strength.

bounds . per game. from
Eric,”’. the coach comment-
ed.

‘Pecorak has also
good. He is a Huckel type
competitor and has a fine
chance of cracking the first
five.

Strong and Postma have
looked superb in tthe drills,
and a tremendous battle for
the point position seems to
be developing between
Pierce ‘and Stelzer.

“The biggest strain for a
coach this time of year is
turning the corner, getting
the players to enjoy the game
again instead of having them
dread each’ practice  ses-
sion,’’ Holland quipped.

‘‘The coaches are here to

Lester —

teach primarily, and not to
discipline."” The players
must be serious themselves
each time they step out on
the count.

‘Holand commented also
on the» excellent . physical
condition of the players. ‘‘Al-

though the team lacks
-height, it is physically
strong.’ So one can. only
conclude that this years

against the Paladins. The
‘Cats netted 108 yard@ rush
ing.

“Furman ran the type of
defense we expected,” Cam-
pagna said, ‘‘and weren't
really as strong as.they ap-
peared to be. Thompson hit
almost half of his passes
and there were 5 or 6 that
the receivers just“dropped.”

“The biggest surprise we
in Furman was the
amount of passing they did.
They had passed very little
in their previous games
and then against us they
opened a stronger attack.”
- (Furman did not pass as
often as the Wildcalts, but
managed to complete their
passes at strategic times

‘ throughout the game.

Campagna said that he
did not see the Paladins de-
fensive backfield as the
basis for Davidson's passing
trouble, but instead the
pressure blitzing lineback-
er placed on the quarter-
back.

Blitzing in pure’ guess-
work,"’ he said, ‘‘and they
guessed well.” If we “had

run anti-blitz plays at the
proper times, we colud have
had a lot better showing.”

Campagna further empha-
sized the iniportance
“breaks’’ played to the Pa-
ladins throughout the game.

‘When tthey blocked a
field goal attempt from 22
yards it was a terrific boost
ito their game,"’ he said, ‘‘at

—Another “break’’ Cam-

interception in the third

sive back hit the receiver

of the ball and allowing an:

Scoring for the Wildcats
was done primarily by Mike
Mikolyunas who caught itwo

Lyons also added a six-pont-
