THE PEANUT PARCHER

With Apologies to Longfellow’s Paul

" Revere.

Listen, fellows, and I'll tell to you

Of the cold, hard ride of the seventy-
two. 4

It happened on a Friday night in Novem-
ber,

A date all who were there, will long
remember.

Pree
When they started out there were
eighty and more,
After a six-mile walk some were tired
and sore.
As they lay by the road, side by side,
Moans and groans were heard far and
wide.

As they lay there shivering, suddenly ap-
peared a light,

And the “Prince Albert Special” hove
into sight.

Of the eighty and more who wanted to
ride

Twelve weary souls failed, and loud were
their: sighs.

In one empty box car about thirty-five
sat,

They sat quiet, and shivered, some chew-
ed and spat,

Through cinders, and cold, and the whis-
tle’s screech,

They waited restless ‘til Barber’s was
reached. :

They stumbled around and found their
way

To the cars that would put ’em in Win-
ston next day.

An open box car was easily found,

And sixty-eight crowded in and around.

After a two hours’ wait on the hard,
knotty floor,

In the old box car which was minus a
door,

The train started on puffing away,

And they landed in Winston at the
break of day.

All afternoon on the left and the right,

This was heard, “I’ll take the ‘special’
home tonight.

So ends the tale of the “Seventy-two,”

And the long cold ride I said I'd tell
you.

On the Glee Club Trip.
Bob—Well, boys, this is Hamlet.”
Fresh—I wonder if I can get an egg

omelette here?

At the Special Saturday Night.
“Say, Speedy, why didn’t you go to
Winston today?”
Speedy—“I am _ financially
rassed.” ;

A Monthly Test.

Professor, after putting up the month-
ly examination questions, asked: “Now,
gentlemen, do any of these questions
bother you?”

Soph—“No, sir, Doctor, but the an-
swers do.”

“This old world we are living in
Is mighty hard to beat.

There’s a thorn in every rose,
But aint the roses sweet.”

Fresh Moomaw asked a cop cut at the
Winston game, “Why didn’t they turn
on the heat.”

The Crown Prince, he is awful thin,
In a contest with Slim Jim he would
surely win.
His legs are so long
That for half a song .
He could wrap around forty-one men.

The Song of Six Pence.
I dreamed a dream and then awoke.
I laughed because: 'twas funny:
I dreamed that I had written home
And hadn’t asked for money. °

Where the wind doth blow, and the

SIGMA UPSILON HEARS DR.
HOOD |ON “MAIN STREET”

Unusual interest was shown in Sigma
Upsilon’s meeting of Wednesday, the
oth... “Main Street,” one of America’s
most famous modern novels, was the
subject of a very interesting paper by
Dr. Fraser Hood. The psychology of
the various characters of the book was
he presented. The
paper provoked an unusally long discus-
sion on the part of the fraternity.

The fraternity is itself writing a book
which it hopes to publish. At this meet-
ing Ray Doubles read the second chap-
ter, which proved to be thrilling and well
written.

James Sprunt also gave an interest-
ing book review.

The fraternity hopes, with the aid of
the faculty and the Book Lover's Club,
to get Vachel Lindsay, one of America’s
leading present-day poets, to speak to
the stydent body in the spring..

CONFIDENCE.

Confidence has
acles. Together with faith, it forms
the strongest thread in the fabric of
civilization. Confidence in God has heal-
ed-the sick and given sight to the blind.
Confidence in the engineer enables us
to ride carefree in railway trains.. Con-
fidence in our fellowmen makes possi-
ble philanthropic work, our great bank-
ing institutions, and our manufacturing
enterprises. Confidence in man works
its wonders before our eyes every day.
Without confidence and faith civiliza-
tion would be impossible. ’

Confidence in the clothing dealer
touches the college man perhaps as
vitally as anything else. When we buy
a suit, hat, overcoat or pair of shoes it
is very gratifying to know wthat we are
dealing with a clothier who stands back
of his goods, for only a small percentage
of us, from lack of experience, are able
to detect a flaw in clothing.

Fifty years of honest dealing has won
for Ed. Mellons the confidence and faith
of thousands of young men in the Caro-
linas. If you deal there you need not
worry about the style, wearing quality
of your purchase. They stand back of
every article they sell. They are en-
abled to do this by handling only the
Stein-Block, Hart,
Schaffer and Marx, and Hickey-Freeman
suits; Edwin Clapp and Thompson Bros.
shoes; Knox and Stetson hats. Ed. Mel-
lons, largest men’s furnishings in the
