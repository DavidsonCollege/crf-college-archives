Soundly

Beaten

A proposed amendment to the Student Body Constitution
allowing open campaigning and the three proposed amend-
ments concerning By-Laws were all defeated by vote of the

Student Body after Tuesday's

The first amendment which al-
lowed for a specified “amount of
money that can be spent by or
for a candidate . . . subjeet to the
approval of the Student Council”
failed to receive the two-thirds
majority vote necessary for adop-
tion, and was defeated by a 2 to 1
margin.

The three proposed amendments
concerning By-Laws were as fol-
lows:

() “That the By-Laws of the
Student Government be amended
by striking out the words in Sec-
tion 5 of the By-Laws, ‘and the
revised by-laws section by section’;
and adding 6 and 7 as follows:”

Another Refugee Family
Selected By Committee

A second Hungarian family, one which will have an of-
ficial connection with the college, has been selected by the
Gift Fund Committee to join the Istvan Hocsak as residents

of Davidson.

The committee, in concurrence
with the result of the Student
Body vote on the three proposals
submitted by Bunny Perkinson,
recently has contacted the family
of Dr. Laszlo Muzsnay, who has
been both a pastor and a univer-
sity professor in Budapest.

Due to the Hungarian puppet
government's unwillingness to al-
low minor children to leave the
country, however, it is not known
when Dr. Muzsnay, his wife, and
four children will arrive in the
United States. The committee has
looked into this matter by con-
tacting the Immigration and Na-
turalization Service of the Depart-
ment of Justice.

The Gift Fund Committee has

cil for Emigres in the Profes-

UNION BALLOTING
YIELDS NO CHANGE
IN NUMBER VOTING

Voting figures released Wednes-

, day by Elections Board Chairman

Tom Morgan show that the new
system of balloting in the College
Union has produced about the
same results as last year’s “in.
Chapel” voting method.

Favored by good weather on
both polling days, Elections Board
poll workers utilized the College
Union veranda as an open air
election booth. They reported a
minimum of difficulty in operat-
ing the new system, although a
heavy voting flurry was reparted
between the lunchtime hours of
12:50 p. m.—1:45 p. m. on both
days.

Tuesday’s results showed a five
per cent drop in the total num-
ber of voters. This was attribut-
ed to the fact. that no presidential
candidates were involved in Tues-
day's balloting, all but three hav-
ing been eliminated in Monday’s
primary.

Actual voting figures, shown be-
low, indicate that the Freshmen
led the other classes on both vot-
‘ing days. The other classes fol-
lowed in descending order.

Student Council Hears
Plan For Point System

A proposed point system regu-
lating student body offices was
the main order of business at the
Student Council meeting Monday
night.

Presented by a Couneil investi-
gating committee headed by Carl
Cooper, the point system would
restrict the number of offices a
student could hold in any one
year.

On the recommendation of the
committee, the plan was deemed
impractical at the present time,
and was referred back to the com-
mittee for further study.

It was announced that the direct
telephone line to Charlotte will be
ready for use by the first of April.
Following a discussion on the time
limits of each call, the Council
voted to impose no regulations
unless the necessity for such
action became evident after the
phone was put into operation.

A petition from 79 students to
change the site of balloting back
to Chapel was read, Requesting
elections “to be held in student
body meeting” the petition was
cited as containing a fallacy. To
be valid, the petition -of neces-
sity would have to state in “com-
pulsory student body meetings.”

Meet The Candidates

and the College at large.

now facing student leadership

Their reactions to the questions fired at them by Da-
vidsonian staff members are compiled below.

Ross Smyth

“The spirit of the Honor System
does not include the right to
deny a boy a good education.”

planners of the proposed court.

In a Tuesday afternoon inter-
view, Mr. Martin answered ques-
tions raised since the release last
Friday of “plans” proposed for a
new court..

When asked whether a_ base-
ment could be included in either
plan, he answered that he con-
sidered the idea “feasible,” but
added that it would increase the
cost per unit by approximately
$5,000. This $5,000 would provide
an unfinished basement which
could be completed at the expense
of the individual fraternities.

Asked to comment on the stu-
dent complaint. that the proposed
plans ‘failed to provide anything
“new” in the line of fraternity
housing, Mr. Martin replied
strongly that he felt the added
space, new terraces, and combina-
tion of eating and social facilities
represented a real step forward
for fraternities at Davidson.

He continued that he thought
little could be gained by delay,
hoping for a gift or several gifts
to reduce the cost. He pointed to
the present need for employment
which, in some cases is “at the

critical stage.”

campaign directed by the fraterni-
ties was viewed with some favor
by Mr. Martin. “If $100,000 could
be raised through such a cam-
paign, either the monthly rents
could be greatly reduced or the
house could be measurably im-

proved.” He continued, “A quota
system could be set up by which

Treasurer M artin concluded sible to most fraternities under
that he “believed in the fraternity} the present system.”

Kelative Estimates Given
On Two Court Proposals

For an additional $4.50 per month, per member,
Davidson fraternities can have single unit fraternity
housing.

This estimate represents only the difference in the
two proposed plans, duplex and single unit, and does
not take into account present board and rent costs which
vary among the fraternities.

To aid in study of the two court proposals the David-
sonian and D. Grier Martin have prepared the following
estimates of relative costs and operating expenses:

Initial cost, single unit. $26,000
Initial cost, single unit with unfinished basement $30,000
Initial cost of duplex unit per fraternity $19,000
Initial cost of duplex unit with basement der fraternity $24,000
Amoant saved per fraternity per year, duplex over

single operation (savings on food, rent. dietician,

kitchen labor, ete.) ; - § 2,160
Extra cost per brother (60 man fraternity), per month,

single units instead of duplex S 4.50
Extra ‘cost per brother (30 man fraternity), single units

instead of duplex $ 9.00
Rent saving per month per fraternity, duplex with

basement over single unit without $ 20.00
Rent saving per month per fraternity, duplex without

basement over single unit without $ 75.00
Present average rent paid for chapter house and

boarding house per month { $95—S$120

He continued, “The events of
this school year have shown that
the system needs flexibility. We
need changes in the letter of the
law without changing the spirit of
the law.” Smyth advocates more
frequent use of the suspension
punishment when possible  be-
cause, as he pointed out, “once
a boy is dismissed from Davidson
it is almost impossible for him to
get into any good school.”

When queried about the much-
discussed plans for a new frater-
nity court this candidate said, ‘J
sam in favor of a new court, pre-
ferably with single houses. If,
however single houses prove to be

too impractical financially, 1

Bill Bondurant

“Davidson's honor system has
proven itself through time and
shows no need for alteration,”
commented Candidate Bill Bon-
durant. “The student council
should uphold and enfore the
system in its entirety.”

The question of the new plans
for the fraternity court brought
forth his opinion that “a change
is necessary, not. necessarily,
however, along the Iines of the
present design.”

Bondurant, in reply to the pos-
sibility of establishing a quota
limit for fraternities, said, “The
change in fraternity housing will
eliminate any immediate need for
rushing regulations.”

“The Hell Week program,”
continued the nominee, “is rea-
sonable, at present, without be-.
ing too strictly limited. However,
if any changes are ‘made. they
should be student initiated.”

atmosphere demands a_ system
such as we now possess.”

The Student Council issue of
lump balloting was contrary to
the feeling of the candidate—al-
though he stressed its good quali-
ties in that “it expedites voting.”

“I would be opposed to any
attempt to integrate the David.

create unnatural and unbeneficial
relations upon the campus.”

personal desires as to the general
classification of the new pres-
ident, Bondurant urged that “the
faculty and student element be
voiced in the trustees’ thinking.”
