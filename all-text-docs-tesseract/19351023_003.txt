Virginia’s Stand On Non-Profes-

CITES OWN EXPERIENCE

Coach Publishes Article In Uni-
versity Alumni Bulletin

Captain Norton G, Pritchett, former
director of athletics at Davidson College,
and now director of the new department
of athletics and Physical Education at
the University of Virginia, writes in the
October issue of the University’s Alumni
News his views of “the vital part that
athletics should play in any comprehen-
sive plan of education,’ and discusses
some of the problems confronting him in
his new position.

“After more than twenty years of
teaching, coaching, and athletic admin-
istration, 1 see no reason for explana-
tions or apologies in believing that the
student who has engaged seriously in
some form of athletics under proper con-
ditions is better equipped for later voca-
tion than is the case otherwise,” writes
Capt. Pritchett.

After emphasizing the importance of
training, he continues, “I cannot conceive
of sportsmanship as an attitude of mind
that permits an opponent to win without
mobilizing every faculty at one’s com-
mand to prevent his doing so. Lose we
must and will at times, and true sports-
manship in recognizing our opponents’
temporary superiority demands our ac-
ceptance of that fact in effective prepara-
tion for the next encounter.”

Capt. Pritchett dwells at some length
on the stand that Virginia has taken on
the question of amateurzation—that of
“splendid isolation.” He insists that it is
wrong to emphasize the faults of other
institutions in this line, but “a positive
attitude toward athletics on our campus
lies in the fact that athletics should de-
mand the best we have to offer in man-
power, support, and unselfish service.”

“IT have a= peculiar admiration and
sympathy for the Virginia athlete who
competes on a losing team: he gets no
pay for his services and’ apparently too
little compensation due him in the form
of support and encouragement. Such a
condition can hardly do other than cre-
ate a spirit of defeatism instead of sus-
tained determination and team work.”
He compliments the determination in the
attitude and action of Virginia’s repre-
sentatives in the ring, that he has ob-
served while serving as referee, as a sigit
of teamwork, and cooperation, and ex-
presses the opinion that if the feeling
spreads to the campus, there will be no
reason for, bickering,

There passed away at the home of Mrs
N. T. Smith, on the morning of October |
15, a dear old colored Mammy who had |

served in the family for more than three |
generations. |

Her faithfulness and her love for |

family and the family’s love for her can-
not be told in words—it is a feeling too
deep and indescribable, and
known only to those who have experi- |
enced it. She was a member of St. Phil
ip’s Moravian Church in Winston-Salem,
and she was laid to rest in that town
where she once lived with Mrs. Smith's
family.

gone, and we shall not see its like agai

in the Social Center on Sunday after-
noon, with Jimmy Selango in charge.
Only about twelve of the forty-five mem-
bers were present.

Professor L. B. Schenck, a loyal

interesting and instructive address on
“Seizing Opportunities.” He outlined a
course of study that should be followed
