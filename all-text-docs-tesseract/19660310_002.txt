Beckham Brings Zeal
To New Cafeteria Job ©

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Davidsonian Steff Writer

Wf there's one word to de-
scribe Bill Beckham, it’s ‘“‘en-
thusiasm.”

The new manager of the Union
cafeteria does everything with
zeal. He meanders from table
to table, joking with students
and soliciting their opinions. He
Sponsors new projects and livens
up old ones. And sometimes he
even serves steak for break-
fast.

Beckham talks about a “‘status

quo of excellence’ which he
hopes Slater Service will attain.
“Our number one objective is
service,” he says. “If we satis-
fy the students, the rest will
come.”

Beckham's service has taken
many forms during his two
months at Davidson. In addi-
tion to the steaks for breakfast,
he has quickened the serving
lines, rejuvenated the snack bar
and opened a restaurant on big
weekends. Still other changes
and innovations, he promises.

“I've noticed that there's more

Beckham has a loyal staff as

“He's wonderful—he really

the cash register. ‘“‘He’s one of

Interfraternity Co-Op
Begins Purchasing

Partial operation of the Dav-
idson College Interfraternity Co-
operative Purchasing Associa-
tion began Monday.

Contracts with venders of four
commodities have been let, and
more contracts will be awarded
shortly.

The co-op is working on an
experimental basis until the end
of this school year, in order to
test ‘its feasibility. The associa-
tion has not yet hired a secre-
tary-bookkeeper as it had plan-
ned.

Tom Covington. fraternity li-
aison officer, explained the rea-
son for this, ‘‘We felt that it
would be better to wait until a
demand has been created for
someone to fill this postiion.
Actually there isn't any real
need at this time.”

Purchases are not being made
through a central co-op organi-'
zation yet. Fraternities are buy- |
ing directly from the vendors.
There is one specified vendor in.
each commodity for all of the
fraternities. The fraternities |
must purchase: through thece |
specified vendors unless there is!
an emergency or a‘situation ap-
proved by the Board of Direc-
tors of. the co-op.

Contracts have been awarded
for linen, poultry and eggs. ice
cream and bread. Covington said
that the overall discount had no‘
yet been figured. but that it
would be between 10 per cent
and 15 per cent. He added, “The!
discounts are as good, or better. '
than expected. We plan to let the
contracts for produce and meat
by the end of this week.”

The co-op association is also
waiting on a ruling from the
North Carolina Milk Commission
as to whether it can obtain the
12 per cent discount on milk al-

lowed to educational institutions.

The co-op was brought about
mainly through the efforts of
Covington and the interfraternity
Treasurers Council. The Board
of Directors of the co-op was
recently elected: Charlie Ed-
wards, chairman; Norman
Pease. vice-chairman: Gary De-
Vane, secretary-treasurer. '

When asked about continu-
ing the co-op next year. .Coving-
ton replied. “‘The prospects are |
real good. I feel sure it will:

be continued.” '

situation." But even then, “I

tice.

; NOVELTY

“I don’t intend for any stu-
dent to be able to predict a
menu,"' he says. Novelty is a
part of his routine—such as a
special spaghetti supper last
month.

Beckham, a natty dresser who
wears a broad grin and a broad
pair of shoulders, grew up in
food service. His father was in
the restaurant business in Harts-
ville, S. C.

He attended Coker College and
the University of South Carolina:
after stints in the service, in fi-
nance and as a restaurant owner
in Society Hill, S. C., he joined
Slater in 1962.

SATISFACTION

Davidson is his fifth college—
following Columbia College, Uni-
versity of South Carolina, North
Carolina State and Louisburg
College. ‘If I'm favorable to the
students and to the client (the
college). T’ll stay,’ said Beck-
ham. “I'm certainly satisfied—
and I’m not a trouble shooter,
just a resident food service
man.”

Beckham is married and has
four children—a boy, 10, and
three girls, 9, 6 and 3.

“This notion of a Christian
homogenized society is satanic,”
charged Dr. Frederick J. Den-
beaux at Vespers Sunday. ‘I
don’t know why I'm a Chris-
tian,’ he continued. ‘‘It fits me,
but it may not fit you.”

Thereby Denbeaux, professor
of Biblical history at Wellesley
College and a Presbyterian
clergyman, censured both tradi-
tional evangelical Christianity
and the current ‘“‘Death of God”
movement, charging that the lat-
ter is ‘“‘a Protestant movement
desiring to homogenize the
church and society.”

In a sermon entitled “Death of
God,”’ the mustached professor
summarized the history of the
contemporary movement, calling
it ‘‘an attack upon traditional
forms of thinking.”

Although finding the Death of
God theologians “insecure and
uneasy because they want every-
one to be a Christian,’’ Denbeaux
was grateful for their ‘nudging
us toward life.’ Moreover, their
definition of God in terms of
verbs ‘reminds us of our own
living God."*

The speaker then shifted his
emphasis to the serious threat
posed by the potential combina-
tion of faith and culture, charg-
ing that ‘‘a Christian America
would only be another name
for Fascism." An audible stir
in the audience responded to his
warning that a continuance of

the present “immoral” policy in
Viet Nam would result in our be-
coming a ‘‘Fascist state.”

In the discussion ‘period fol-
lowing the sermon, Denbeaux
elaborated on what seemed to
be his obvious antagonism for
evangelism; ‘Christianity is just
not everybody's cup of tea. I
can’t see ramming it down
everybody's throats.”

In reply to a question about
the war in Viet Nam, he called
it an ‘immoral situation’ and
wondered, ‘‘What good is God
doing us now?’ “He will judge
us,” Denbeaux warned.

define his theological position.
“I'm Biblical, not Calvinist,”’ he
replied, ‘‘and I'm theologically
conservative.‘ He further char-
acterized his theology as an
‘American version of Barth.”

On several. points Denbeaux
is inconsistent. For example, he
stresses the humanity of Jesus
(“I think Jesus was often
wrong.’’), but he believes in: the
literal resurrection of Jesus.
When questioned about a mortal
man’s rising from the dead, he
replied, ‘“‘Just because I've never
seen a human rise from the
dead doesn't mean it can’t hap-

pen."

PRAM Solicits Aid
For Exchange Trips

“Top-notch students” from
seven colleges have already ap-
plied for participation in the
Project of the Americas ex-
change program this summer in
South America, according to
Erskine Sproul, president of
PRAM.

With applications already in
from Duke, Vanderbilt. UNC at
Chapel Hill, Greensboro and
Charlotte, Queens, Sacred Heart,
Belmont Abbey and Davidson.
Sproul said that he was also ex-
pecting applications from Louis-
jana State and Tulane.

In addition to this summer's
program, which is sending three
delegations of five students to
Ecuador, Peru and Honduras,
PRAM will also bring seven
Ecuadorian university students
to study and travel in the U. S.
The entire exchange will con-
sist of 22 students, costing
PRAM about $500 each.

PRAM is now participating in
an extensive fund-raising drive
on which, according to Glenn
Withrow, PRAM coordinator,
‘we're putting in 100 hours a
week.”

The financial goal has been
set for $20,000. The bulk of
the money now collected is the

$2,000 from the Cannon Poun-
dation.

Money is being solicited from
foundations, industries and indi-
viduals in the United States and
Ecuador. Also each local PRAM
chapter has a $500 goal.

Thomas Bus Co. of High Point,
which runs a line of buses in
Ecuador, is highly enthusiastic
about the project. According
to Withrow, this company may
give money and/or a bus for
the Ecuadorians to use while
In the U. S. this summer.

PRAM has also applied for a
highly competitive $10,000 grant
from the Mary Babcock Founda-
tion and has promising contacts
with Procter and Gamble and
the Lineberger Foundation of
Belmont PRAM has an appoint-
ment Monday to ask for sup-
port from the college.

Following the recent write-up
in The Charlotte News, PRAM
will send out ‘Hot 100° letters
to leading businessmen and or-
ganizations in Charlote request-
ing financial backing.

“Any donations from alumni
or friends are welcome,” With-
row remarked. ‘Money can be
given to Davidson College and
earmarked for PRAM.”
