football are money sports; they

generate more spectator inter-

est; they are more important —

than field hockey, cross-coun-
try, lacrosse, etc.; and athletes
add variety to Davidson. They
belong here. Ed Farrell and
Eddie Biedenbach are doing
solid jobs so give them a break.
If after a certain period of time
their programs aren’t produ-
cing, then bring in new blood,
but for now leave these pro-
grams alone and see what hap-

Mike O’Koren doesn’t’ rank
far behind Gminski with regard
to overratedness. The skinny 6’
8’’, 6'7"", or 6’6’’ (depending
upon which press guide one
picks up) senior couldn't hit the
broad side a barn down the
stretch this year. His career
high of 31 points came as a
freshman, and he never touched
that again. But who couldn’t
excell playing alongside the
likes of Phil Ford and ‘Sweet

-D"? Dean Smith points to the

fact that O’Koren led his team
in rebounds, assists, minutes
played, defensive recoveries,

_. skinned knees and left-handed
dunks, but where was OK when

his team needed the thirteen
footer against Texas A&M? He

Wood, that’s where. Wood car-

‘One might refute my state-

ments by referring to, the no-

.zone-rule in the NBA which

says that a Jersey City player

the rack at will can forego the
outside jumper. That’s manure.
There’s as much zone played in
the NBA as in most college
conferences. O’Koren will as-
sume Jim Spanarkel’s position
on the end of some team’s bench
unless he goes to the Celtics
who can mold anybody).

Joe Barry Carroll can’t be
neglected. His exploits were
raved about all season long, but
when one examines his trusty
Sporting News he will find
Carroll’s name present on only
one list of individual statistics,
that being scoring. He averaged
21 a game which seems meager
after listening to Al McGuire
describe him as another ‘‘air
craft ‘carrier.”’ Carroll is 7’1”
and weighs 240 pounds and yet
wasn't among the nation’s top
20 rebounders. UCLA’s little

big men pounded him on the ©

glass in Louisville and_ his
defensive ability is question-
able. Carroll can definitely put
it in the hole, but he won't get
the chance when Sir Slam,
Cowens, etc., start throwing
their weight around. JBC either
needs to hit the bench press or
learn to play facing the basket
because he isn’t physical
enough, or at least didn’t

display it at Louisville to excel
in the NBA.

Kelly Tripuka claims the
fourth spot on this illustrious
team and this pick requires
little explanation. Tripuka is a
step slow, not a tremendous
leaper, possesses a jumper
which rivals O’Koren’s eighteen
footer and fits right in with all
the chunky white boys at Notre
Dame. His name and reputation
carried him two years ago as a
freshman but no more. Granted
that Digger Phelp’s club plays
team ball but Tripuka’s passing
and defense don’t offset his low
point production, 13 per game
this past season. He’ll have to
improve his floor game and
adapt to a quicker transition
game, which isn’t characteristic
of the Fighting Irish, if he

hopes to hang on in the NBA
because his power game will be-
rendered defunct by Truck Ro- ©

binson, Dan Roundfield and
similar power baliplayers. Tri-
puka is too slow to play in the
backcourt..

They'll probably put a’ price :

say his ankles are too thick and

he can’t score unless wide open.

Completely undefensed jumpers
are few and far between in the
big leagues and Macy will see
smoke when he faces Maurice
Cheeks, Tiny Archibald or
whomever. He is a fine marks-
man from the charity stripe, but
if I recall he lost his hunch at the
line against LSU and couldn’t
come through in the clutch
against Duke either. (Yea, I
know he had a virus or some-
thing, but you know what they
say, ‘‘When the going gets
tough...) Macy will have to be
drafted by a patterned team if
he hopes to earn his bread
playing ball and disciplined
clubs are indeed rare in the
NBA today.

To conclude this highly opin-
ionated piece, Kelly Tripuka
doubtlessly reaps the most o-
verrated award if for no other
reason than his frizzled hair,
which is obnoxious. Also,
Hawkeye Whitney and Mark
Aquire would have been includ-
ed because of their tournament
performances, but their rear
ends are ample enough to bump
and run with the big boys who
play the power game.
