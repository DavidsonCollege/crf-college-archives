THE NEVIS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Alumni Quarterbacks Dip Colors

Moderation, in the guise of a care-
fully explanatory, persuasively politic
President Martin, won a battle at the
recent meeting of the Athletic Coun-
cil.

Actually, according to an_ in-
formed source, there wasn’t much
opposition to the status quo. Wild-
cat Club members did present a reso-
lution calling for increased athletic
grants, but when Dr. Martin and Dean
Frontis Johnston pointed out that the
athletic program benefited greatly
from the present arrangement, and
stood to realize even greater benefits
as the Living Endowment Fund grew,
they quickly dipped their colors and
forgot about the resolution.

The alumni are to be congratulat-
ed for their conciliatory attitude and
evident willingness to work with re-
newed efforts toward the $200,000,
1960 goal of the Living Endowment.
It is true that if such a goal is reached
the number of football scholarships
would increase by ten, but if these
men become interested in working
for Davidson for this reason, or any
reason, we can only applaud them.

Frankly, we are not entirely satis-
fied with the situation as it was left
after the meeting of the Athletic
Council, Ideally, Davidson needs a
program of “amateur athletics.”
Coach Bill Dole has the same ideal.
At the present time, as Coach Dole
is quick to point out, such a program
is not at all feasible. Scheduling dif-
ficulties are the biggest problem; if

Davidson went to an “amateur”
status there just wouldn’t be anyone
to play.

The only possible alternative to
the present set-up would be a foot-
ball and basketball conference com-
posed wholly of schools not operating
on athletic scholarships. This would
be a Southern counterpart of the Ivy
League, and would include such
schools as Washington and Lee and
the University of the South (Sewanee),
which have already given up subsi-
dized athletics, This would be ideal,
and should be kept in mind as a fu-
ture goal. Many major changes, how-
ever, would have to take place in
alumni and trustee attitudes before
such a goal could be realized, and ad-
ditional difficulties in organization of
the league would have to be over-
come.

Considering the practical factors,
we have about the best program pos-
sible; that is if it remains as it is.
Any attempt to “keep up with the
football crazy Jones” of the Confer-
ence would be a mistake.

The most encouraging develop-
ment on the athletic scene is the at-
titude of President Martin, an up to
now unknown quantity. Judging from
information the DAVIDSONIAN re-
ceived, Dr. Martin seems to be firm-
ly in the ranks of those who want to
keep athletics at Davidson sane.

We hope that over the years he
will receive not only faculty, but
strong alumni support for his posi-
tion.

“Y" In Danger

We have neither the qualifications
nor the inclination to say what is
wrong with the present YMCA. Prob-
ably the matter involves many fac-
tors and influences too subtle for
anyone to fully evaluate. But the fact
remains: the “‘Y’” has slipped. Rev-
erend Staples tacitly admitted it this
morning; Cabinet Members agree,
and the testimony of a staggering
Gift Fund drive, the abandonment of
membership meetings. and flagging
student interest prove the point all
too well.

Up until now there has been a
disturbing attitude prevalant in
YMCA circles that ‘everything is all
right.” Reverend Staples spoke frank-
ly Wednesday, refreshingly frankly
for a member of the administration,
and admitted that the situation was
something less than satisfactory.

Now is the time for all concerned
with the status of the YMCA on the
campus to take their heads out of the
sand and think realistically about an
organization that is in definite danger
of fading completely from the cam-
pus scene.

Bringing College
Up To Par

Slowly, but steadily, the quality
of the course offerings at Davidson
is being brought up to par with that
of the better schools of our type. The
latest milestone in this development
is the curriculum revisions that have
taken place in mathematics and
physics. As with other recent cur-
riculum improvements, this one also
received its impetus from within the
departments concerned, taking the
form of adjusting the rather anti-
quated existing courses to the vari-
ations in capability and preparation
among students and to the changes
in these subjects themselves and the
purposes for which they are being
taught.

The innovations in the Mathe-
matics Department have been fore-
shadowed by developments in the last
two or three years, but the revisions
in Physics, which has in recent years
come to be regarded as one of the
weakest departments on the campus,
came as a welcome surprise. Equally
noteworthy is the fact that the two
departments cooperated closely in
their actions, in order to facilitate the
use of mathematics in physics courses
and to get physics and engineering
Students started on advanced work
sooner.

Perhaps the most important fea-
tures of the new program are the
separation of students planning ad-
vanced work from those who wish
only an introduction to the principles
and foundations of the subject, and
the readjustments which will allow
highly qualified students to advance
quickly and far. These new courses
will do much to make more palatable
the required courses in math and
science which in the past have often
held back students genuinely inter-
ested in the subject itself and at the
same time failed to arouse any inter-
est among those concentrating in oth-
er fields. Certain other departments
could take a cue from Math and
Physics.—C.H.C.

Tom Maxwell

The many friends of Tom Maxwell
were deeply grieved and shocked to
learn of his tragic death last week.

Such occurences are difficult, if
not impossible, to understand or cx-
plain. We shall make no attempt. All

that we can do is express our sin-
cere sympathy to his parents, and say
that he will be sorely missed by his
friends here at Davidson.

Ironically, the papers stated that
Tom Maxwell died as he was ‘“com-
ing back to Davidson.” “Coming
back.” Somehow we think this is im-
portant, and we shall always remem-
ber and respect him because he was
“coming back.”

THE PHILOSOPHES

Encounter With A Wise Man '

I talked to an old man the
other day. He’s the sort of man
who makrs you aware of things
that have been troubling you
all along. And then he gives
you a hint of the breadth of the
life you can make out of those
troubles.

Talking to him was like open-
ing windows and letting the
startling wind in to blow free.

Someone had told me that
he had once offered advice
to aspiring young poets. The
advice was a word: “Don’t.”

t asked him about it.

“No, no. I never said that,”
he said, his words rubbing
against each other like dry
gravel gurgling, if dry gravel
could gurgle. “Do it, but at the
peril of your life. America
needs poets. needs artists. It's
costly, but I'm willing to sac-
rifice a few men to the need.”

These are almost his exact
words, but his spirit refuses
to hide itself in his words.
He is uncapturable; he is all
phrase and spirit wrapped up
in personality. He is all pine
snd apple orchard. He is the
sun that is a golden shock
in his white hair angling
down across his forehead.

He is the snow of that hair,
and the bushy brows with their
scattered smaller black hairs
poking up like bent weeds
through the snow. He is the
little swift stream running and
glinting in his seizing eyes.

“Job said to God once,
‘Thou ert more to me than

my necessary food.’ And |
say, ‘My individuality is more
to me than my necessary
group.’” This he said to me
hard. He wanted me to un-
derstand.

“That word ‘necessary’ does
it,” he explained, his hands
making motions as if to create
a razor edge on which to bal-
ance his meaning. ‘Some
group is necessary — nation,
state, family — but it can’t rob
you of your spirit.”

We were walking along the
sidewalk. It was grey and
cold and the traffic snapped
by close to us on the damp
street. He paused and said,
“People don’t walk much
now; they ride cars. ‘Pedes-
trian’ has come to have a low
meaning.

“But then back a while ago
when everybody had horses
they rode their horses every-
where they'd go. Same thing.

They rode so much they got
bowlegged.” and he squatted in
a bowed curtsy to give the ef-
fect. ‘They were equestrians.
We're pedestrians.”

| asked him what he called
the people in the cars. He
waved his arm at the line of
traffic making bumble-bee
noise going by and answered,
“Aristocrats.”

I know that some men who
do what this gentleman does
have a fragile sensitivity about
being misunderstood, about be-
ing trampled by the “common”
man. I asked him if he'd out-

Bie
. . by Cole

grown his sensitivity.

“No,” he shot back quickly
in answer, like a flash of sun-
light on a piece of wet stone.
“But you don’t talk about these
things.”

1 remembered then what
he hed said about man dig-
ging deep into something,
man needing to accept @
certain amount of drudgery
and base labor, man’s need to
lose himself in something
outside of himself. Now |
understood that better.

We got to the house where
he was staying. We had got to
talking about whether man was
alone or. whether he was hound
up with all other men, and be-
fore he went in he told me that
both were true. ‘It’s that way.
And it's not something you
reconcile, either; both of ‘em
are right.”

He did try to form a word
wilh his hands to make ‘em
one, but he couldn't. He tried
to find another way to say it,
but he couldn't, probably be-
cause there isn’t any other way.

You can't end a column
about Robert Frost. You just
have to leave things hanging
on a quiver somewhere out
of reach. There is more that
he doesn’t say than there is
that he does. He is too big
for a moment and for words.

Michaelangelo said that man
is unfinished. Robert Frost is.
He is still going on, and prob-
ably will be after he is gone.

Student’s Dissatisfaction Aired
In This Week’s Campus Forum

Dear Editor:

The other day I heard a pret-
ty young Miss confide in her
equally lovely companion, “You
don’t have to worry about these
Davidson. boys; they'll sit
around and talk all the time
and never get down to action
darn it.”

ey

“DO-NOTHINGS”

Right there, I decided it’ was
my duty as a Davidson Gentle-
man to nip this rumor in the
bud, and well — I did convince
that one young lady that we
were men of action. but I'm
sure that there are lots of oth-
er people who still feel that we
are a bunch of “do-nothings.”
And the sad part of it is they're
right.

The only time Davidson ever
gets anything new is when the
old either burns up, falls down,
or resigns. As a freshman I was
informed of Davidson’s tradi-
tion, and I have a warm spot in
my heart for tradition (in fact,
I get heart burn every time I
eat a traditional sandwich in

PEANUTS

PEARLS

the union). But tradition is no
substitute for initiative: right
Major Fleming?

SMALL PRINT

I was also informed that once
in college I would be my own
boss. and I could do as I
pleased. Ha! whoever said that
forgot to read the small print
in the contract. “Thou shalt
not be guilty of conduct unbe-
coming to a Davidson Gentle-
man.”

This is not an easy job, this
being a Davidson Gentleman.
You have to go to the same
dry class every other day —
“Lectures good enough for your
Grandfather are good enough
for you.” You must never over
cut. You must slosh through
rain filled sidewalks. You must
wait hours for service at the
Union.

ON YOUR OWN

You must order dill or sweet
on your sandwiches at Hugo's.
You must be scalped once a
week by Norton or Johnson.
You must never question the
decisions of the faculty and

administration, And you must
love your trustees as you love
yourselves. Thus the angel said.
Aside of this, you're on your
own.

I thought once to write Miss
Wright in the Charlotte Observ-
er about my problem, but she
would only ‘advise me to trans-
fer to a college like U.N.C.
where a man is his own boss
until he's had a few beers and
becomes everybody’s boss.

LEADER

But perhans a leader may yet
arise to lead us out of bondage
into the promised land of milk
and unlimited cuts. Now is the
time to act. They said it
couldn't be done!!! And they
could be right. Can Davidson
get unlimited cuts? Tune in
this same college next semester
and see!

I do not know what course
others may take,

But as for me

Give me unlimited cuts, or
U.N.C.

THE SPECTATOR

Teen-Age Tragedy
To A Tribal Theme

By TOM KERNAN

I believe that the following letter, which I received
several days ago, merits our attention:

Dear Mr. Spectator,

I am gettign tired of listening to my girl friend
run-down “rock ’n roll.” I think it is popular because
it makes sense to us normal “joes” and it’s something
everybody can understand and enjoy. I'm sending you
a new record with this letter; I want you to listen to it
and tell me how I can convince my girl that it’s good

music.

Dear Upset,

UPSET

I'm going to tell my reaaers what your copy of
“A Teen-Age Tragedy” is like. The song is done by Ber-
tha Bloat and her Bleating Bards. It opens with a reed-
organ solo, indicative of the tragic theme, and Bertha

Sings the first stanza:

My teenage Baby,
She’s some bomb!
She caught rabies

At the Junior Prom.
Ah-ha-hum, Ah-ha-hee,
Bo-diddily, unh-huh

Yum, yum, Wheeeeeee!

Wump! (Bass drum).

A Chorus follows in which six guitarists, an old vaude-
ville pianist, and two bass drummers are accompanied
by the Bleating Bards; a background of chanting and foot-
patting is provided by a choir of Wambesi maidens. The
tempo increases, the music reaching a frenzied peak, and
intermittent shrieks of “Kill, Kill” become audible. (Evi-
dently, the. Wambesi maidens lost control of themselves
during the excitement and reverted to ancient tribal
practices, for when order is restored, one tenor has dis-
appeared from the ranks of the Bards.) Bertha picks up
the melody, considerably out of shape due to the foot-
patting, and sings the second stanza.

My Honey-Bear’s

Not dead yet;

She’s under the care
Of the county vet.
Ah-ha-hum, Ah-ha-hee,
Bo-diddily, unh-huh

Yum, yum, Wheeeceee!

Wump! (Bass drum again).

At this point, the whole group joins in, and the song
draws to a fade-out close, the Wambesi managing to maké
off with another tenor and the piano player. Yes, Upset,
this song has many fine qualities. I think that one is im:
pressed by the tragic conditions which surround the typi-
cal young America. Notice the reference in line one to
“bomb,” this refers to the threat which hangs over us.

Connect this with the “wump”

of the bass drum, a sym-

bol of the exploding bomb. The intervening hums, hees,
diddles, etc., give the picture of forced gaiety in the face
of destruction. Yes, life is pretty darn tragic for young
Americans, and “rock 'n roll” expresses that tragedy with

vivid force

BOOK REVIEW

and please, Upset, may I keep the rec-

A Southerner’s Look
At Southern Problems.

By CHARLES CHASTAIN
Davidsonian Associate Editor

James McBride Dabbs, The
Southern Heritage, Alfred A.
Knopf, 273 pp., $4.00.

It is important to understand
just what Mr. Dabbs’ book on
the race situation in the South
is not. To begin with, it is not
a sociological or. psychological
description or interpretation of
the behavior of Negroes and
whites in the South. It is not a
piece of polemical propaganda,
of the sort that. has marred the
presentation of both viewpoints
on the race question. And it is
not a statement of any dog-
matic, inflexible theory about
how Southerners now act or
ought to act. The Southern
Horitage is a sober examintaion
of the moral dilemma now con-
fronting the white Southerner
in his relations with the Negro
and of the past and present cir-
cumstances which have put him
in this untenable position. The
predominately moral and ethi-
cal tone of the book cannot be
overemphasized, and it is, I
think, its great strength, when
tempered with Mr. Dabbs’ difs-

avowal of any kind of “holier-

By Schulz

iF SOMEBODY LIKES

YOU, HE PATS YOU ON THE

HEAD...IF HE DOESN'T LIKE

YOU, HE KICKS You!
C

than-thou” approach to the cus-
toms of his neighbors.

Within this moral and ethical
framework, The Southern Heri-
tage is above all a message to
Mr. Dabbs’ fellow Southerners.
It is, as he puts it, written “for
those who love the South so
much they want to make it bet-
ter, ... for those who remem-
ber our great and tragic past,

and for those who do not re-
member but who are so imbued
with that greatness that they
face the future with hooe.”

After pointing out the fal-
lacies in the arguments usually
advanced by segregationists, he
poses the question: “What help
can the symbol of segregation
give us as we face the future?”
It can give us none, for “the
language of segregation, of
white supremacy, is almost a
lost language... . Every day
we use it we become less able
to understand the world and
be understood by it.”

It is this false symbol of seg-
regation that keeps us from
seeing that the future of the
black South and the white
South are inextricably bound
up together, for “the white
Southerner is the man he is
because he has lived among Ne-
groes, and they are the people
they are because they have
lived with him.” Only if there
is acceptance of this “hasic fact
of our lives” can_ there
be any solution to the region's
greatest problem, or any pos-

sibility of upholding the last-
ing values of the Southern
heritage.
