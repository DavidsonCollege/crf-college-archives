1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN |

‘Administration examines Davidson’s male/female ratio

By DAVID PETRANICK

Ever since Davidson began
admitting female degree-seeking
students in 1973, a popular point
of debate has been the changing
role and importance of coeduca-
tion at Davidson. One especially
perennial topic concerns the male-
female ratio in admissions. The
current ratio is approximately
sixty males admitted for every

forty females admitted. Many of '

the questions asked about admis-
sions deal with this specific ratio.
Why are more men admitted than
women? Should the ratio be a pur-
ely fifty-fifty one, or should
Davidson adhere to a strictly sex-
blind admissions process? Basi-
cally, is Davidson living up to its
committment to co-education?
The topic is a delicate one to
deal with, especially in light of the
consequences involved. Accord-
ingly, decisions made in this area
are the responsibility of the Trus-
tees. As the administrator of the
college and its activities, Presi-
dent John Kuykendall °59 is re-
sponsible for the implementation
of Trustee decisions such as the
aforementioned admissions. pol-
icy. To fully understand the Trus-
tees’ policy and Davidson’s sub-
sequent actions, however, it is
useful to have a grasp on the his-
tory of coeducation at Davidson.
As most know, Davidson’s
Board of Trustees in the early
seventies arrived at the conclusion
that part of the college’s future in-
- volved welcoming female stu-
dents into. Davidson’s normal
four-year curriculum, thus shed-
ding what was becoming a slightly
outdated single-sex format. There
were (and still are) several good
reasons for becoming a coeduca-
tional institution, not the least of
which remains obvious to this
day, that there are literally
thousands of intelligent, talented,
and qualified females who would
certainly contribute much to
Davidson’s academic and social
atmospheres. This has been
proven by numerous Stuart Schol-
ars, honors graduates, merit reci-
pients, and other distinguished
female leaders in the Davidson
College community.

Most rooms which have been

open in Chambers during evening

hours will be locked at 5 p.'m., and
some rooms on the south wing of
‘the building which will remain
open for study will be locked at
midnight, according to a new pol-
icy which is currently under
negotiation.
Registrar Sue Ross says that,
due to faculty complaints about
the condition of the rooms in the
mornings, most of those rooms
will be closed so that janitors can
make sure that all rooms which are
open during the night are clean be-
fore 8 a.m. classes. Ross says that
‘the policy, which she emphasizes
is still being negotiated, is already
in place but will simply be more
strictly enforced in the future.
“Generally, the policy has

What most do not realize,
however, is that coeducation at
Davidson got off to a slow start in
its first few years. Gardner Roller
Ligo, who is now the Associate
Dean of Admissions, was a mem-
ber of the consortium group. of
1971-1972, and she recalled what
it was like to be one of Davidson’s
first female students. ““There was
a recognizable difference in the
sizes of the male and female class-
es,” Ligo stated, “and this was a
direct function of the applicant
pool at the time.” As a matter of

fact, the original plan set forth by.

the Board of Trustees was a two to
one (male to female) ratio based
on projected plans of enrolling
one-thousand men and _five-
hundred women in the student
‘body. The Board later moved to a
plan which | linked enrollment
ratios to ‘application ratios, and
which also called for continuous
review of the policy.

By 1982 the. policy, which
.was regularly and constantly
evaluated by the Board of Trus-
tees, had taken on a new range in
the form of the current sixty-forty
ratio. Again, this ratio was dic-
tated by the results of the applicant
pool. Dr. John Griffith, Vice-
President for Institutional Ad-
vancement, took the position of
Dean of Admissions in 1979, and
with it he inherited the two-to-one
plan. Griffith pointed out that at
the time he took office, the
number of qualified women ap-
plying to Davidson (as compared
to earlier years) was increasing,
while the number of qualified men
was actually remaining more or
less constant, despite increased
recruiting efforts. Thus, from
academic, recruiting, and social
standpoints, it was not only feasi-
ble but advantageous to change
the policy.

Throughout the eighties, there
‘have been many who have wanted
to see Davidson go to a fifty-fifty
ratio, or even a sex-blind policy.
Dean of Admissions James Hen-
drix, Jr. "63 questions the logic
behind a switch to sex-blind ad-
missions. “The main question we
would have to ask ourselves when
implementing such a policy would

be ‘To what end are we doing
this?”

This proves to be a particu-
larly apt question when one
realizes that at a school of David-
son’s size, the percentage range
cannot empirically swing any
farther than a sixty-forty ratio,
simply because the ‘special
groups’ at Davidson, e.g. sports,
music, etc. would take a beating.
If in any one year, the ratio were to
hypothetically hit a mark of se-
venty men to thirty women,
women’s sports would have a hard

time fielding very many teams at —

all. The same is true if the situa-
tion were reversed.

Therefore, it becomes under-
standable that Davidson must
maintain a reasonable rate of ac-
ceptance and not risk using a sex-
blind type of system. This does
not in any way suggest, however,
that Davidson is shirking its own
duty to co-education. Rather, as
Kuykendall stated, “the Board of
Trustees’s decision seems to: re-
flect what we are witnessing take
place in the applicant pool.”

There are many, however,
who maintain that there are in re-
ality some females on the ‘waiting
list’ who are essentially stronger
than some of the males who are
actually accepted. As Griffith and
Kuykendall both point out,
though, this may not be entirely
accurate. “The main problem,”
according to Kuykendall, “is that
you are trying to evaluate people
with parameters that are impossi-
ble to set. Every applicant is
unique. and therefore different,

and there is really no way simply .

to rank everybody on a numerical
scale according to SATs or other
test scores. Other factors, such as
extra-curriculars, have to be taken
into account.’

Jim Shaw, an admissions
counselor who graduated from
Davidson in 1985, agreed with
Kuykendall. “We do not just look
at: test scores as the determining
factors in a student’s acceptance
to Davidson. While we do rate
applicants on an academic scale,
they are also rated on a ‘personal’
scale. That is, will they ‘make

positive contributions to David-
son?...” Ligo also added,

“There are two main factors in-
volved. One, can the applicant do
the work? And two, will he/she fit
into the college community?”

When dealing with this par-
ticular topic, one.is bound to run
into several misconceptions.
Many of these myths need to be
clarified:

Myth 1: Male alumni are more
likely to contribute to their alma
mater than are their female coun-
terparts. Not true, says Hendrix.
“There is no evidence at all which
would support that statemént,
mainly since women have not
been here long enough to gain any

telling statistics.” “Another diffi-~

culty with that,” Kuykendall
added,
have been at Davidson for a rela-
tively short time, and thus many
may not yet be in a suitable finan-
cial position to make major gifts to
the college.”

Also, there are quite a few
females who do play an important
role in the college. Ligo, of
course, is a perfect example, as is
Melissa Jones, ’86, who works in
the Presdient’s office, and Kaudie
McLean,
Shaw as anothér admissions coun-
selor.

Myth 2: The football program
takes up spaces that should go to
other deserving students. “Coach
Gatto does not recruit those
players who could not make it on
their own.” asserted  Ligo.
Further, “Coach Gatto’s first two

recruited classes (90 and ’91)

were some of the strongest in
terms of grades and test scores of
many of the previous years’.”
“Besides the football team,” she
added, “other sports, the arts, and
other special areas of college life
also receive extra consideration.”
Myth 3: This issue is currently
being ignored by the administra-
tion and the Board of Trustees. As
Griffith stated, “This policy is
constantly re-evaluated every year
for timeliness and practicality.”
“A very important issue such as
this is certainly a concern of ours,
and if a change seemed appropri-
ate, I am confident that the Board

“is the fact that women |

86, who works with

would take the: matter’ ndider ad-

visement.”

_ The final problem, however,
is yet to be solved. Why does the
applicant pool continually. show
this sixty-forty ratio? Over the last
four years, Davidson has had
7,519 students apply for admis-
sion. ‘Of these, 4,381 (57%) were
men. Last year’s numbers showed
an even more vivid example. A
total of 2,014 students applied for
admission, 1,203. (59.7%) of
which were. men. Hendrix be-
lieves there are a few reasons for
this continued trend. As was
stated, coeducation at Davidson is
a relatively new game, and this
could present some problems in
attracting female applicants who

, might not know as much about the

school.

Another more: serious: possi-
bility is present, however. Shaw
pointed out that the admissions
staff always makes sure that they
are as honest as possible with pro-
spective applicants, which might
unfortunately create ‘worry in
some of the female prospectives.
“This is very possibly a circular
process,” said Shaw. “The aver-

age female might come in, find

out about the ratio of male to
female students, start to think that
it will be too hard for her to make
it, and select herself out of the ap-
plication process without giving it
a chance.” Hendrix admits, “We
might have a slight ‘Catch 22’
situation in that aspect.”

The Board of Trustees is
scheduled to’ meet at the end of
this month (they meet three times
yearly). At this time, it is unlikely
that the issue will be located on the
agenda. The final. solution,
though, could very well lie within
the school itself. As Hendrix sum- _
med up, “One of the main prob-
lems we are having is that we (the
admisssions staff) are puzzled by
this ’applicant rate of sixty-forty. I
hope that we can do a better job of
recruiting in the future and devel-
op Davidson’s applicant pool
further in terms of quality and
contrast.” If Hendrix’s wish
comes true, Davidson could very
possibly be really for another
change.

rs’ rooms may soon be locked

been in place that all rooms are
locked at night except during
exams because at that time, every-
one is studying in the library,”
Ross said. “I have tried to be flexi-
ble about leaving rooms open
under the assumption that students
will help out by making sure that
the rooms are left in condition
they were in before they started
studying there.”

Ross said a number of factors
influenced the decision to enforce
the policy now. A number of
facutly members have complained
about the disarray of desks and
writing on the boards when they
have entered their classrooms in
the morning, according to Ross.
Ross also said windows have also
been left open and lights left on
which creates unnecessary ex-
pense in heating and electric bills

for the building. Several rooms in
Chambers, additionally, have
equipment such as maps which
need to be in locked rooms during
the evenings, according to Ross.
Faculty have also complained
about the noise in the hallways of
the Chambers building during the
evenings when they are in their of-
fices working, and Ross said she
is also concerned about the safety
of those who are studying in
Chambers.

Ross said in the past the prob-
lem was not so significant because
the college employed a night
watchman (not associated with the
Davidson police) who regularly

walked through Chambers to pre-

vent such problems from occur-
ring. That position has since been
eliminated, and the college now
relies on campus police officers

for the safety and maintenance of
the building. |

“With a smaller number of
rooms open, we can simply ask
the police to make it part of their
schedule to walk through the
building at midnight and lock the
doors and to work that into their
rounds, but they can’t be walking
through this building all the time,”
Ross said.

Ross said that the policy is
currently under negotiation, but
she emphasizes that without stu=
dents agreeing to take better care
of rooms, students will not be able
to study in Chambers at night. She
says she does want to hear from
students who are concerned and
that students are her first concern.
The final policy decision will be
announced in the next issue of the
Dean’s Outbasket.

“Davidson is a community.
The buildings are here to be used,
but there have to be guidelines be-
cause there are times when stu-
dents have not been entirely re-
sponsible. I feel that the faculty
complaints are legitimate, and I
have adjusted the policy in light of
the student body and what I con-
sider to be the fair response. Right
now, it’s not assured that Cham-
bers will be open for studying dur-
ing exams. That’s not a God-
given right.”

SGA president Conrad
Doenges expressed the concern
that alternative places to study are
not available to students late at
night. ‘
“The 24 hour study room is oc-
cupied for people who study there
