Gripes, Groans Mark Past Week
Of Intramural Flickerball Battles

By JAMES ROLAND
Sports Writer
With irregular pass-plays,
loud cursing and much grip-
ing about the officiating, the
IMAC flicker>all season roll-
ed into another week, with
several teams in hot compe-
tition for a commanding lead.
“This season,"’ according
to Doug Rhymes, - president
of the IMAC, ‘‘there is no par-

ticularly outstanding team.
In the past, there has always
been one team with a great
halfback and the schedule be-
came a runaway from the
start. But this year the de-
fense is controlling the. tem-
po of the game."

The referees have been un-
der constant attack this year.
“Despite a 25 cent per game
increase in pay, the compe-

tence of the officials has
dropped immeasurably.”

“Fraternity representatives
should send officials who at
least know what a first down
is." Rhymes added. SAE
Paul Rothert said he favors
“some sort of training pro-
gram for the officials.”’

Phi Delts clobbered the Sig-
ma WNu’s, 59-6. scoring as of-

Victory Over Duke Sails

In Regatta

Tad Lowdermilk grabbed
two first places and Jim Lee
scored another to pace Da-
vidson's sailors over Duke
last Saturday in the winners’
first regatta of the term.

Sailing on placid Lake Nor-
man, Lee, Lowdermilk and
the other skipper, Tom Kirt-
ley, led the Davidson sailors
to victories in the first, sec-
ond, fourth and fifth races, to
give the ‘Cats a 43 edge in
the race totals.

Lee and Lowdermilk foul-
ed in the third race to give
that one to the Blue Devils.

Booters Open

Davidson's soccer team
opened its 1967 season here
Monday by pulverizing Ers-
kine'’s booters by 6-1.

Center forward Alfonso Ca-
rillo a Richardson Scholar

Lowdermilk said all the races
were close and the competi-

“It was good team racing
all around,” Lowdermilk
said.
The Davidson seamen used
Jet-14s for the races. Crew-
ing for the winners were Joe
Kilpatrick and _ freshmen
John Mopre and Lewis Ri-
ley.

Davidson's next competi-
tion will be Oct. 28, when the
sailors journey to Norfolk for

With the score 3-0, Coach
Harry Fogleman substituted
his second team. Against the
subs Erskine mounted its on-
ly successful drive. An Ers-
kine inside capped the at-
tack with a shot past David-
son goalie Jeff Plainer to
make the score 3-1.

Early in the second half,
lineman Dilley addded an-
other point to the ‘Cat totals.
Carillo then ‘booted in his
third goal for the day, one
short of the school individual
record for the most number

‘of goals per game.

Davidson's final goal came
on a Davidson drive late in
the second half. Inside Frank
Heiner shot for the goal, but
the ball rebounded off the
posts. Wingman Peterson
trapped the rebound and fir-
ed quickly at the goal for the
final point.

“We had terrific offense
during the game,"’ said half-
back John Flowers. “We
must have shot about 50
times."

While Davidson's offense
hammered at Erskine's
backs, the 'Cats’ defense held
the losers’ attack in check
for most of the game. Ers-
kine was able to mount only
one strong drive during the
entire afternoon. Standouts on
Davidson's defensive unit in-
clude center halfback Cliff
Patterson and team captain
Bobby Pryor. who played
left halfback.

One of Davidson's telling
advantages was team depth,
a feature that has been Jack-
ing on Wildcat soccer teams
in the last few years, accord-
ing to Coach Fogleman. This
time Fogleman had enough
players for two full teams
and then had a few men left
over.

One of the reasons for the

ten on defense as on offense.
The Sigma Chi’s edged the
Pi Kappo Phi‘s 7-6 in a close
contest, while the SPE’s de-
feated the Independents, 12-

Monday, the Phi Gam’‘s
improved their record with a
19-7 victory over the Kappa
Sig’s. The ATO’s lost. to the
KA‘s 20-19, in a contested
game whose validity will be
decided’ in the next IMAC
meeting. Monday also saw
the Delt’s beat the Independ
ents, 26-7, and the Pi Kappa
Phi's win their first one with
a 19-0 shellacking of the
SPE's. End John Huggins
and backs Larry Jones and
Yates Fletcher starred for
the Pi Kapps.

The Delt’s then beat the
SAE’s, 46-6, Tuesday, while
East 1 gained a forfeit over
East 31. Cannon It defeated
Cannon 1, 26-18, to the East
I for the freshman lead.

In Wednesday’s play, the
Sigma Nu’s beat the Pika’s,
20.13 in a game highlighted
by interceptions and re-inter-
ceptions. The KA’s beat the
SAE’s, 6-0, to wrap up Wed-
nesday's play.

added depth is the new con-
ference rule which permits

freshmen to play on varsity
athletic teams except foot-

ball and basketball. There |

"Cats Stay With Pirates
Until ECU Blitz Clicks

By GARY FAGG
Sports Writer

Sparked by Whit Morrow's
TD run on the opening kick-
off. Davidson's Wildcats kept
up with East Carolina for
most of the first half before
the Pirates finally over
whelmed them, 4217, here
last Saturday.

“Victory was well within
our reach.” said Davidson
Coach Homer Smith. ‘‘The
team was physically ready.
and the boys were fired up
for the game.”

But apparently so was East
Carolina, as the Pirates
weathered Davidson's first
quarter blitz and came back
strong to overpower the ‘Cats
in the second half.

Sophomore Whit Morrow
set the pace for the high
scoring game. when the 170
pound defensive halfback
scampered 85 yards for a
touchdown on the opening
kickoff.

But East Carolina counter
ed a few moments later.
when Pirate Coach Clarence
Stasavich’s offensive machine
ground out 70 yards in seven
plays to tie up the score.

Davidson completed its
scoring in the second quar-
ter, when junior fullback Ker
ry Keith burst through the
Pirate line and. galloped 15
yards for his fourth TD of the
season. Senior John Giles
added three points with a
33-yard field goal later in the
quarter, giving Davidson a
short-lived 17-14 lead.

But a 58-yard touchdown

pass from tailback Dennis
Young to end Jimmy Adkins

vaulted the victors into a 2t-
14 lead late in the half.

Then tailback Neal Hughes
rifled an 1t!-yard TD pass to

end Bob Withrow in the final
seconds of the half.

East Carolina's late half
blitz was only a hint of Pi.
rate power which was dis
played in the second half. The

to East Carolina last Satur-

Harriers Bow To Deacs
In Season’s First Meet

Davidson's _ cross-country
team, running its first meet
over the new five mile course,
fell Wednesday to a powerful
Wake Forest squad, 15-44
here. The Deacons swept the
first five places in the event
run Monday afternoon.

Deac runner John Hodson,
who paced the field, set a
record for the five mile dis-
tance with a time of 27:17
minutes. Davidson's Jim Mc-
Laughlin was the first ‘Cat
to finish, coming in sixth ov-
erall. His time was 31:12
minutes.

Finishing right behind Mc-
Laughlin was John Puckett
of Davidson with a time of
31:23.

Low score wins in cross-
country.

Davidson Coach Heath
Whittle praised two freshmen
runners, who participated in
thelr first varsity competi-
tlon. Reeves Louthan finished
fourth among the Wildcats
and 10th in the meet. Ran
Coble came in sixth for Da-
vidson and 13th overall.

“We were not too dis
appointed by our showing
against Wake Forest,"’ Whit-
tle said. ‘‘They have a sub-

sidized program and they had
run two meets already.'’ The
Deacons have beaten North
Carolina State and bowed to
Duke.

“We'll do a lot better from
now on, now that our boys
know that they can handle
the longer course.” he said.

Jones’ team, which consists
largely of sophomores, lost to
West Virginia and East Car-
olina but beat Virginia Mili-
tary Institute, 3-0, last Satur-
day to set its conference rec-
ord at 1-2.

But Coach Jones seems to
be a little less optimistic than
the sportswriters. “Davidson
has a fine team,” he said.
“They have Jimmy Poole
who is the best quarterback
in the Southern Conference
and a good running back In
(fullback) Kerry Keith.”

Jones warned his team
Tuesday that Davidson would
be a tough competitor, espe-
cially on its home field. Rich-
mond will have to stop the
passing combination of Poole
and receivers George Han-
nen and Pete Glidewell, he
said, and foil Keith's running
to hold the ‘Cats.

en wilt command the Rich-
mond offense, which has scor-
ed only 16 points in three
games this season. Against
