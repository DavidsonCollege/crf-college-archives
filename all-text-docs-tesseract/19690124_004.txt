Davidson Rugby: You Gotta Love It

What it looks like Is the brand of backyard football ©
you used to play with your kid brother, all tackling,
sliding and generally fumbling around.

What it sounds like is “professional” wrestling on
television on Saturday afternoon, with the grunt of
a fall body slam. It has more noise than a Hal Karate
advertisment.

What it is is rugby, and it's one of the roughest
sports going. It’s also the latest thing on campus.

Twonty-five students arc now grouped together a3

Lunn and freshman Zack Mobley, and without aid
from the school, the team will open its 10-game
Season the first day of March against North Carolina

tate.

The rugby story at Davidson is an interesting one,
for it was the brain child of a single student who, in
fact, had never touched a rugby ball in his life when
he decided that Davidson needed a rugby team. The
credit goes to Mobley. a freshman from Durham, who
carries enough weight to make up for the smaller inen
on the team.

Interested at first as 4 spectator al some of the Duke
University nyatches last year, Mobley learned s300n

as a rugby ployer in his native England and in South

idea of a Davidson team was feasible, Moblev called

season rolls around the team should be able to run
with any of them.

Rua is right. The game is running. Jt is toughness
and it is coordination. But ihe Davidson team has all of
these ingredients. Desertbed by Mobley as a bunch of
“frustrated jocks” the team consists of both freshmen
and upperclassmen. large ana small, fast and not-so
fast. But the whole team shares one trait, a love fer
the game that only one of them has ever played before.

Reecuiting in collegiate

The individua) programe
of Lefiy Driesell, the head
basketball coach, and Ho-
mer Smith, Davidson‘s foot-
ball mentor, depend heavily
on the success of their re-
cruiting.

Thorefore, both coaches
have been spending most of
their apare time reading,
Studying, and sorting Infor.
mation about hundreds of
high school athletes as well
as observing and making
contact with several of the
outstanding prospects.

Hanging there are corde

“Davidson, of course, is a
