his throws rolling right out of the
basket. With about five minutes to
play, Guilford rallied and overtook
the Wildcat lead. Brice was taken
out and Crawford sent in. The half
ended with Guilford in the lead by
two points, the score being 15 to 13.

The second half opened up with
neither side playing brilliantly, but
cach was fighting hard and the play
got rough at times. Guilford, led by
the playing of Frazier and Newlin,
began establishing a lead which
was never overcome, Two goals
were rung up in rapid succession be-
fore the game was well under way.
The Wildcat defense stiffened and
Stricbeck and Roberts managed to
score. At this juncture Shepherd
replaced Chalmers at guard. A few
minutes later Romefelt went in in
place of Striebeck. The play fa-
vored Guilford in the last minutes
of play and the final score was 29
to 22.

The gallery was of course a Guil-
ford crowd and they did not fail to
back their team solidly, while it was
losing in the first few minutes of
play. The winners’ “spirit and pep”
reminds us of our own, and the Red
and Black were treated in fine or-
der. A return game will be played
on the Hill late in February.

Only One-Half of the Common School Pupils

Only one-tenth of all Eighth-Grade Graduates com-
plete high school: only ten per cent. of high school
graduates of America enter college. The college grad-
uate owes much because he has received much.

Montreat Graduates Hundreds

Who have not enjoyed the benefits of a college edu-
cation. When a Davidson alumnus helps to make
Montreat “ADEQUATE FOR ALL,” he thereby
repays in kind some of that debt he owes society and the Church.
