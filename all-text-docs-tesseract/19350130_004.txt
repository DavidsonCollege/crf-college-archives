by MANOR? BROWN
McEver Remains

It was tuneful news to all Wildcat sup-
porters when Coach Gene McEver an-
nounced, after several days of contem-
plation, which kept us all a little uneasy,
that he would return to Davidson as as-
sistant football coach, favouring the
Presbyterian institution over his alma
mater, the University of Tennessee. It
seemed for a while that he would surely
accept the Tennessee offer, which prom-
ised considerably more, in a financial way,
than he is now getting, but he very
pleasantly surprised Davidson enthusi-
asts when his decision was made prefer-
ing the Wildcat position.

He is apparently quite happy
over having settled upon this job,
and is now back at the Wildcat’s
lair beginning to shape up his
fourth edition of ball carriers for
the Davidson eleven.

It will be no easy task this year with
Johnny Mackorell, Joe Wingfield, and
Dewey Hutchins, backfield mainstays for
the last three seasons, having finished
their football careers with the 1934-sched-
ule, but Coach McEver produced them
and I believe he will develop some able
successors for these outstanding backs.

Much Publicity

This bit of negotiating that Mc-
Ever carried on with the Tennes-
see officials brought nation wide
publicity to Davidson football. It
was a question of interest to all
American grid fans, who have fol-
lowed Tennessee football teams
during the past few years, and are
familiar with the celebrated career
the genial Wildcat mentor had
while in school there, and the fact
that he chose Davidson when he
had a much more imposing offer
from his own college has, no
doubt, caused many of them to
wonder why?

We can’t answer this, but it is our
privilege to say that we are delighted to
see Coach McEver still a member of the
Davidson «coaching staff.

It was might nice of him to get
all of the good publicity for David-
son, but it wasn’t exactly fair for
him to get us all frightened by al-
most accepting another job.

Soph Cagers
Five of the ten Wildcat basketeers,
now campaigning in Georgia, are mem-
bers of the Sophomore class, Three of
these have garnered regular berths on the
quintet and the other two can fill in very
nicely when necessary.

Kenneth Knoor, Maurice Pea-
body, and Bill Quick, the trio of
second year men, who played in
every game this season, are sur-
prisingly skilful and well poised on
the court.

It is extremely heartening to know that
the Wildcats are being delivered by the
advent of these Centennials from the bas-
ketball wilderness they have been in for
the four or five seasons previous.

McPhail Ill
Sed news to the Davidson
reached its ultimatum sev-
eral 7a ago when they were told
of Captain Fred McPhail’s having
to undergo an operation for ap-
pendicitis.

This is the greatest blow that has come
to Wildcat athletics this school year.
McPhail ran consistently first in the high
and low hurdles for two seasons and at
the close of the track schedule last
spring he was elected to captain the 1935
team. It is believed now, however, that
he will be unable to take part in any
competition this year.

Coaches Pritchett and Whittle
had enough troubles without los-
ing the services of Captain Mc-
Phail, but they have been cheered
by the return of Ras Eyans, sprin-
ter of the 1934 team, who wasn’t
in school last semester.

Coach Unger To Present Ex-
hibition Match For Fans’
Information

FIRST BIG FIVE MATCH

Davidson Victorious In Every
Match So Far This Year

Davidson's wrestling team will have
its first match against collegiate compe-
tition, Saturday night at 7:30, when the
Wildcats meet the Duke grapplers at
the local gym. Duke will bring a strong
and well-balanced team to Davidson.

There will be a special attraction pre-
ceding the match for the benefit of those
fans, especially ladies, who are not so
familiar with the fine points of wrestling.
This will be an exhibition match, fea-
turing Coach Unger and a member of the
team, in which they will demonstrate and
explain various important holds and roles
of the mat. There will be no admission
charge for ladies and a special section
has been reserved for them.

The Wildcats have already had six
matches with strong Y. M. C. A. teams
throughout the state and have won them
all by overwhelming scores. Coach Unger
has developed a skillful and aggressive
team which promises to be a ‘strong con-
tender for the state championship. The
team is fortunate in having several ex-
perienced veterans who have proven their
ability in previous years. ‘These include
Captain Charlie Fort, Leroy Black-
welder, Lawrence Quarterman, Jim Hod-
gin, and Frank Owen. Sophomores
Johnny Allen and Polk Moffett, new-
comers to the mat, have shown up well
in the lightweight divisions and with a
little experience they should develop into
topnotch wrestlers,

The following is a tentative line-up of
the Davidson teant’ for the Duke match:
Moffett, 118 Ibs; Allen, 126 lbs.; Thomp-
son or Parker, 135 lbs; Owen, 145 lIbs.;
Quarterman, or ‘Shirey, 155 Ibs.; Hod-
gins, 165 Ibs.; Blackwelder, 175 Ibs.; and
Captain Fort, unlimited.

On the following Saturday, Davidson
will meet V. P. I.. This match has been
arranged to precede the basketball game
and will offer a double attraction to sport
fans in this section,

Kitten Quintet Siw
Talent Despite Upsets

Promising talent has been noticed in
the ’Kittens quintet despite their drop-
ping three out of four engagements this
season.

The Wildkitten loopers trounced the
Paw Creek basketeers 18-10 after having
dropped a 17 to 16 contest to the Paw
Creek team before the holidays. Cap-
tain Wade Barrow netted 6 points for
honor score in the first encounter with
Bill Kiesewetter receiving high scoring
honors in thes,second contest with 9
tallies to his credit.

The ’Kittens suffered a severe drub-
bing at the hands of the Carolina Tar
Babies in the local gym, the score being
43 to 22, on January’ 26. The. Carolina
first-year cagers took the lead early in
the contest and held high score through-
out the game. Barrow and Kiesewetter
rang up five tallies each for the David-
son quint. Meroney, lanky Carolina
fresh center, led the attack for the Tar
Babies with his long underhanded shots,
scored ten points.

The Charlotte Hot Point quintet .eked
out a 24 to 16 win over the ’Kitten bas-
keteers. The Davidson freshmen started
a spirited rally in the final period to toss
in 14 of their 16 points. Jack Overall,
Kitten center, and Kiesewettertossed
six tallies each for Davidson in the sec-
ond hand,

Kiesewetter takes high scoring honors
so far with 25 tallies while Barrow fol-
lows second with 19 points. Both have
captured positions at forward on Coach
Grier Martin’s team. Bill Harris and
Lawrence Reid, guards, show earmarks
of being available material for varsity
competition next year.

Local Basketeers
On Southern Trip

Laird Accompanies Team On
Four-Day Basketball Trip

Coach Flake Laird and ten Wildcat
cagers left Davidson Monday afternoon
for a four day trip through South Caro-
lina and Georgia.

Monday night the Cats faced the Wof-
ford Terriers at Spartanburg and then
proceeded to Atlanta for contests on
consecutive nights with Oglethorpe, At-
lanta “Y”, and The Jewish Progressive
Club.

The games with Oglethorpe and Wof-
ford will be the second meeting of these
clubs with the ’Cats. Davidson was vic-
torious in both previous contests, down-
ing Wofford in an extra period game and
defeating the Petrels by the narrow mar-
gin of 41-38.

Davidson has won six of the nine
games played this season, flashing an of-
fense which has netted an average of
more than 35 points per game. Duke,
State, and Carolina have handed the ’Cats
their three defeats.

The men making the trip are: Harris,
Ross, Morgan, Peabody, Quick, Knorr,
Porter, Cathey, Yelverton, Windham, and
Manager Ravenal.

Fraternity Basketeers

The inter-fraternity basketball tourna-
ment will get under way Monday after-
noon when the S. P. E.’s are scheduled
to meet the K. A.’s. This is the only
game scheduled in the first round, the re-
maining seven teams having drawn byes.

Practice will be held the remainder of
this week to allow these nine quintets
to round ito shape for this tourney. At
present captains for four of the quintets
have been named. They are as follows:
Phi Gams, Branton; Pi Kappa Phi, Hun-
ter; Kappa Sig, Loftin; and S. P. E,
Jenkins.

Play in the second round will find the
Betas meeting the S. A. E.’s and the
Phi Gams playing the Kappa Sig in the
upper bracket. In the lower bracket. the
Phi Delt’s will play the Pikas and the
Pi Kappa Phi will meet the winner of
the S. P. E.-K. A. contest.

No man is allowed to participate in
basketball during his training in spring
football and track.

CAT CINDERMEN
BEGIN TRAINING

Pre-Season Meets Are Scheduled
For Both Varsity And
Freshmen

Varsity and Freshmen track men be-
gan training early this week in order to
have teams in shape for two indoor meets
preceding the regular season.

On muddy days when the regular track
is not in running condition, the cinder-
men will work out on a new 330 ft.
wooden track erected on the intramural
field. Special stress will be put on pac-
ing and timing while working on the
boards.

Besides permitting more regular work-
outs during the rainy season the new
track will afford valuable practice for the
two indoor meets. The team will enter
one in Charlotte on February 25, and an-
other March 9 in the Tin Can at Chapel
Hill.

Both the above will be invitation meets
with entrants from several colleges. The
freshman team will not run in Charlotte
since the meet is an open one.

The ranks of the track team, already
depleted by graduation, suffered another
loss last week when Captain Fred Mc-
Phail underwent an appendicitis opera-
tion. He will not be able to do any run-
ning this season.

However, Ras Evans, stellar sprinter
of last year, is expected to return to
school for the spring semester, this giv-
ing the team a good boost. Walter Dick-
son, star of last year’s Freshman team,
is looking good in sprints, broad jump,
and high jump. John Newton and Dick
Johnson are expected to replace Cochrane
on the shot and discus,

On the Freshman squad, Wicker, Wil-
son, and Harrison show promise in the
hurdles,

Other prospects are: Hogan, with the
javelin; Graham, 440; Fort, on the pole
vault; and W. Barrow in sprints and
hurdles,

The varsity schedule follows:
Feb. 25—Invitation Meet, Charlotte.
Mar. 9—N. C. Indoor Meet, Chapel Hill.

Wildcats Win Contests Over
Catawba, Oglethorpe, And
Lenoir-Rhyne

RAY REX LEADS RALLY

Felines In Tie With Deacons For
Big Five Cellar

Coach Flake Laird’s quintet has shown
fairly consistent improvement during the
past few weeks of engagements, rising
to their best form to defeat Catawba,
Oglethorpe, and the Lenoir-Rhyne Bears,
while the major contest of the series
was dropped to North Carolina State,
who proved a little too fancy for the local
five.

N. C. State—Davidson

Led by the dynamic Ray Rex, the Red
Terrors defeated the Wildcats 29-21 in a
contest that proved “disastrous in more
ways than one,

Davidson opened up the fireworks with
a five point advantage, but the Raleigh
combination soon launched a counter at-
tack to wipe out the deficit completely
and move themselves in the lead for the
remainder of the game. At the half they
countered a 14-10 advantage.

The cats missed numerous open shots
and failed on eight tries from the charity
stripe.

Oglethorpe—Davidson

Putting up a strong second half rally,
the Davidsonians’ rolled over the Ogle-
thorpe basketeers by a 41-38 margin here
in the school gymnasium, although the
Georgians led 21-18 at the half.

Captain Charlie Harris of Davidson,
led his team in a scoring spree after the
intermission to run up a 10 point lead.
However, the smooth working petrols,
led by their lanky center, Copeland, soon
cut the lead to within three points of
victory, when the final whistle blew.
Peabody and Harris were the outstand-
ing stars for the ’cats.

Lenoir-Rhyne—Davidson

Playing a return contest with the
Wildcats, the strong Lenoir-Rhyne
quintet from Hickory were defeated for
the second time in a game that featured

‘plenty of thrilling action.

Morgan, tall Wildcat center, paved
the way for a victory and put the game
on ice for the local quint, while Peabody
and Quick, two Sophomore members of
the team aided materially in the kill.
Morgan accounted for 17. points against
the Bears and received numerous favor-
able comments on his playing, particular-
ly in following up the shots.

Catawba—Davidson

Coming from behind in the last half,
the Davidson ‘Wildcats shot baskets at all
angles to cop a six point advantage over
the fast Catawba basketeers from Salis-
bury to win 36-30.

During the first half the game was a
see-saw affair with each team on top at
one time or another, but in the last period
the cats, led by Morgan, Ross, and Har-
ris, connected to sew the game up. It
was the second victory for the ’cats over
the Indians.

Soccer Stars Practice
