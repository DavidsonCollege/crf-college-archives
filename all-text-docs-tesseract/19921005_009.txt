JYAer Recounts Year in Pyatigorsk, Russia

By Ashley Cockrill
September 17, 1992
Well, here I am back at
Davidson, and it almost feels like I
never left (with the exception of the
fact that I don't recognize half of
the people).

I spent my junior year abroad in
Pyatigorsk, Russia, andin Decem-
ber 1991, 1 wanted to write a short
summary of what was going on in
the area of Russia where I was and

send it to the Davidsonian. Since ©

our infamous former editor of the
__ newspaper expressed an interest
in receiving articles from students
other than “overrun touristy Eu-
rope” (or something like that), and
since the events of the former So-
viet Union seemed interesting to
the rest of the world at the time, I
decided to write about my frustra-
tion with the situation there. How-
ever, due to circumstances beyond
my control, my article was not sub-
mitted until now, the fall of my
senior year. :

December 14, 1991
I’m now on my way to Mos-
cow—a 29-hour train ride from
Pyatigorsk. Since the Aeroflot in
our region doesn’t allow us to fly
unless we pay in dollars (foreign-
ers must be registered to live here
in the U.S.S.R: for more than year
in order to fly for rubles), we’ve
become accustomed to long train
rides. It doesn’t really matter,
though, because there’s no gas for
planes right now anyway.

'Two other American girls and I
have been studying here in
Pyatigorsk, Russia, fora little over
three months now. Icelebrated my
twentieth birthday two days ago,
and when one of the girls asked me
if I felt any older, I replied, “I feel
like this semester has put about ten
years on my life.” Pyatigorsk is
located between the Black and
Caspian Seas, 1000 miles almost
directly south of Moscow. (This is
the third yearin arow thatDavidson
has had astudentfrom Pyatigorsk).
We’re in the northern Caucasus

Mountains, probably the mostdan- —

gerous area of the “Soviet Union”

rightnow. The Che-Chen automic
republic’s capital, Grozny, is five
hours southwest, and the republic
of Georgia is directly below us
(where there is currently unrest in
the capital of Tbilisi and also in
western Georgia). Armenia and
Azerbaijan, southeast and south-
west respectively, are not on
friendly terms. Basically, all these
areas are “anti-Russian” because
they all want their independence
from the “Soviet Union” and they
feel that Russia-is going to try and
take them over when a new Union
is created.

It is impossible to live here with-
out constantly having politics the
main topic of conversation. I’ve
met people (Russians) who say
they couldn’t care less about poli-
tics—all they wantis to live better.
Politics is everything here. The
reason there isn’t food here—poli-
tics. The reason there’s no gas for
planes—politics. Thereason things
are so backwards here in general—
politics. It’s mind-boggling what
anaive American I’ ve been. Some

of the stories I’ve heard are just.

incredible—about how the system
‘here has caused people such suf-
fering. Why just the other day, my
Russian professor for grammar told
me that in Moscow, meat trucks
were being stopped so thatthe meat
could be taken out, have gasoline
poured on it and have it destroyed.
This seemed highly unlikely to me,
but then, this same professor told
me that, with his own eyes, he saw
aman.oma tractor go‘over his crop
of potatoes, intentionally. The
conclusion he came to is that the
government is purposely stopping
the transportation and production
of food to the people to keep them
from thinking about the political
situation here. If the government
supplies the people with just
enough food to get by, then they
are constantly concemed with this
and not always with what’s taking
place in the Kremlin. I was just
flabbergasted after hearing this, but
I’ve come to the conclusion that
here the ‘potential of corruption is
beyond anything I ever conceived

of earlier.

Most of the people I’ve met
here are supportive of Boris
Yeltsin. Of cours, he seem like the
most likely candidate for helping
this country and its people out of
the biggest rut they’ve ever been
in. But the thing is, he’s about the
only person available to have faith
in (Gorbachev’s not-even consid-
ered anymore), and what these
people need more than anything
right now is someone to have faith
in. Of course, there also exist
people who think things will only
get worse with Yeltsin—like my
history professor. here (who, I’m
convinced, is still adie-hard Com-
munist). He might be right about
Yeltsin not being the man to fix
these problems, but after he told us
several times in class what strong,
smart, humanitarian men Lenin
and Stalin were, I think he’s the
naive one. There’s no going back
to Communism now, not after all
that’s happened here.

I just finished reading reading _

some articles my mother sent me
about the fear of great hunger here
this winter. Of course, I look at it
differently after hearing stories like
the one I told earlier. But the
concrete truth is that there is noth-
ing in the stores. I think it’s much
worse in Moscow and Leningrad
right now than in southern Russia.
We still have fruits at the markets
because they are grown nearby.
But in the stores, honestly speak-
ing, there is only bread, and not

-even that the whole day. The one

constant thing since we’ve been
here has been big jugs of apple
juice. Two weeks ago we were
told that there soon wouldn’t even
be that, and right now, there is
none. Nobody knows why. No-
body knows anything. Or maybe
someone knows, and he/she is just
lying. On those special days when
butter, eggs and milk are brought
in, there are always lines. There is
no cheese nor sugar at all. Most
everything has to be bought with
ration cards (which haven’t been
used since war-times), exceptat the
market, and everything there is

really expensive for people here
(with the exception of those who
have American dollars or Deutsche
Marks). When we arri ed here in
September, the exchange rate at
the bank was 32 rubles to the dol-
lar. Right now, it is 90, and in
about another week it will be even
higher. (When I left in July ‘92 the
rate was 130.at the bank and. around
150 on the street.) The inflation
rate is unbelievable. Unfortunately,
people’s salaries aren’t going up
with the inflation rate, so the ruble
is worth less and less every day,
and it’s making itharder and harder
for people to get by. It’s going to
be hard.to go back to America and
realize that things are expensive.
Rightnow, we Americans here are
living on Monopoly money.

We’re going to Moscow to see
if we can get tickets to Germany to
spend Christmas there. It’s espe-
cially hard to travel outof the coun-
try right now. The people at the
ticket windows will probably tell
us there aren’ tany tickets, and then
we’ Ilhave to bribe someone. Noth-
ing really gets done around here
unless there is a bribe involved. I
know this happens in the. United
States, too, but it still completely
surprises me that this is reality
here.

My mother asked how I would
describe the Russian character.
Immediatlely, I thought of scenes
in the post office and other govern-
mentoffices—rude, shippy women
who jump down your throat if you
simply ask them-a.question, or
worse yet, ask them to repeat what
they said. But goodness, whocould
blame them? They’ ve got terrible
jobs with low pay, and after a hard
day, they have to shop for food (
and everone can imagine what all
that entails), deal with the husband
and the children, cook and clean
up, and start all over again the next
day. Sometimes, the complete
opposite happens—we’ ll be on the
street, someone will ask us some-
thing, realize we’re foreigners, and
immediately invite us over for din-
ner. When in someone’s home the
hospitality overflows. Once you

get to know people, they will bend
over backwards to help you. It’s
interesting how it’s a complete
paradox.

I think the most depressing thing
that’s happened to me since I’ve
been here was just the other night.
My Russian roommate and I were
in our dorm room watching the
news. - We’d just learned-that
Yeltsin had made plans to set upa
new Union with Ukraine,
Belorussia, and possible Armenia,
and that by not conferring with
Gorbachev, still the acting presi-
dent of the U.S.S.R., he acted “un-
constitutionally.” As if anything
here is done by the law! Anyway,
it was especially frustrating to my
roommate because here we were,
two girls about the same age, sit-
ting on the same bed, who are from
different countries and live such
differentlives. She hada hard time
believing that there even exists a
country where the political situa-
tion is stable and people are not
constantly worrying about whether
or not there will be food in the
stores the next day. What also
amazed her is the amount of free-
dom weas Americans possess. It’s
really unbelievable the amount of
bureaucratic garbage they must go
through in order to travel abroad.
I, for oné, can’t imagine being de-
nied the right to travel the world if
I had the chance to, i.e, enough
money to do so.

It may sound like I’m not happy
here—that’s not true. I’ve made a
lot of close Russian friends al-

“ready, and I’malready planning on

returning to beautiful Pyatigorsk
in the future. I know I’ve chosen
the most interestng time by far to
be here. This place is a real mess
right now—a big frustrating
mess—for everyone here. I know
America has its problems, but it
hasn’ttaken me long to understand

chow much we really take for

granted in our daily lives there.
I’ve already had some unforget-
table experiences here—think of
the stories I’ll be able to tell my
children!

The win raised the Wildcats’
record to 5-2-2, 2-0 in Southern
Conference play. They fell com-
pletely out of both national polls
after losing to UNCC last week,
but could jump right back in witha
win- Tuesday in Raleigh against.
#10 N.C. State. UNCC, with the
win over Davidson and a tie with
then-#5 South Carolina, entered
the Soccer America poll at #15.
