THE DAVIDSONIAN

P-ED

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1997 7

Crew team experience teaches this freshman the value of unity

it.

For many years, I thought I would
never be capable of uttering this phrase,
for belonging to a team, or group, or
even a loosely established partnership
meant being subjected to the weak-
nesses and deficiencies of those within
the team.

I’m not sure when this thought
process evolved. Perhaps it was those
first few years of elementary school
when all the teachers were convinced
one or two “good” students could pull
together a group of “average” students.

And what that teacher never knew
was that the “good” students simply did
all the work themselves in an effort to
save the group’s grades. And then there
was middle school and high school,
with all those group projects we had to
do out of class, and the teachers just
knew there would be no problem for
everyone to meet after school (since we
could drive and everything).

And of course there were my three
years with the high school swim team
still in the growing phase. We were so
desperate for swimmers that over half
the team couldn’t even swim the length
of the pool, but no one complained —
out loud at least.

Since arriving on,campus a very

short six weeks ago, I’ve defined team
in a new light. In one phrase: Davidson
club crew.

For any freshmen (or upperclass-
men) who were previously unaware,
there is, in fact, a crew team on this
campus.

You may have seen us in the early
hours of the morning in front of
Richardson Dorm meeting for a 5:30

a.m. practice on the lake. Or you may
have heard us howling across campus
for a Wednesday morning 6:30 a.m.
team conditioning practice. Or you
may have seen us in the Union some
Sunday night meeting to discuss up-
coming regattas. :

We're a part of that
group on campus who

experienced leader trying to pull all of
us novices off our butts.

And I’ve found support and words
of encouragement, plus a whole lot of
laughs, in my boat of guys: David,
Potter, Derrick, and Matthew. They’re
the only people I know who let me yell

sleep during ‘class be-
cause we got up early,
and not because we
stayed up late.’ (Well,
sometimes we do both.)

Teamwork, unity are alive and well at
Davidson. Just look around.

Like the many other
teams on this campus, we work hard
and we have fun.

Since starting practice a few weeks
prior, I’ve acquired a great deal from
this group of individuals.

I've found a president who has
dedicated her life to the team, who
always has a smile and a hug for her
athletes, and who sometimes feels like
I did back. in elementary school: the

at them five mornings a week, tell them
they’re slackers, and then invite me
over for dinner or a game of “Diplo-
macy.” It’s incredible.

And I see over 20 new freshmen,
students just like me, who are willing to
commit their time and efforts to learn-
ing and developing a brand new sport.
Until the first practice, you see, I had
never been in a boat before, and neither

had many of them. So to all my compa-
triots on the crew team, I say thanks.

Before I finish, allow me to make
a final addendum. It has been my privi-
lege over the past six weeks to observe
team unity and strength in many places
— not just crew.

I’ve seen excitement and energy
from the. Bonner Class of 2001, re-
sounding victory from the football team,
stamina and consistency from the vol-
leyball team, unity from the swim team,
commitment from the soccer teams,
strength and determination from the
cross country team, and success from
the efforts of many organizations:
Project Life, the Student Union, SGA
— the examples are endless.

Sol say thank you to you, Davidson
students, for renewing my belief in the
team concept.

And to Matthew Hobbie, my fel-
low journalist, I say if you are searching
for student unity, look no further than
your own back door.

Mian’s search for meaning

ecently I encountered a rather
curious fellow on one of my
frequent walks with the new

addition to my off-campus home —
Santana, my dog.

Although the hoped-for benefits
of such ex-
cursions

themselves to the sub-human.

The reason this fellow, and other
have-faiths like him, must witness to
the lack-faiths is that their existence is
being undermined. Envy of the lack-

faiths ability to live “with-
out appeal” is secondary
to the erosion of their faith

Santana to
relieve
himself
somewhere other than my bedroom, I
have come to enjoy the time spent alone.
Most often, I walk in silent observation.
Either Santana has not learned to carry

* on a coherent conversation, or I have

not learned to listen closely enough.
In any case, I occasionally en-
counter a noisy human or two. Usually,
the conversation is innocuous and ca-
. nine-centered. On this particular walk,
however, the discussion took a sharp
and decided turn. Noticing my long
locks and free air, the curious gentle-
man began to proselytize about his faith.
Truth be told, I listened a bit to this
surreptitious serpentine fellow, but in-
difference soon led me back to the path
and my journey — far from temptation.
However, at some point in all of
our lives, we are tempted by the faithful
who wish to aid us in our quest for
meaning in life. The results may not be
in just yet, but it seems the “have-
faiths” fare no better than the “lack-

in-the religion of moral-
ity that results from con-
tact with those who exist
in a state of contentment
and lucidity without belief in a higher
order.

Only a homogeneous world, de-
void of all counterpoints, will vindicate
their lives. [tis impossible for the have-
faith man to live his life in opposition

Ignoring the physical impossibili-
ties of the phenomenon of life after
death, the problem with this scenario is
that in a world in which only one exist-
ence is certain (the present one), the
cost to the have-faith man for being
wrong is irretrievable.

Death is an unforgiving creature
and I, for one, am unwilling to delay

‘living at the command of some very

sketchy men who in the comfort of their
pulpits and rent-free homes spew rheto-
ric about giving one’s life to G-d.

The construct of religion is human
as is every other social and cultural
phenomenon. We have built a machine
based on fear that feeds on itself and the
weakness and depravity of its subjects.

I cannot say that this world has no

His very existence is mired in the
sticky fact that he lives at the expense of
others and, consequently, he is reduced
to less than of what he is capable —
essentially becoming sub-human. For
this man, life begins after the burial
ceremonies commence because his G-d
gives his life meaning in the “next” life
or existence.

We understand in human terms,
and that is where meaning for our lives
must originate. Our life experiences
provide us with the basis for explora-
tion and understanding that we must
use to search for meaning.

This path is no safer or more se-
cure, but the fruitis real, and knowledge
is not held captive.

ou just have to know how to
play the Game, my father
tells me as we have our bi-

monthly chat. What is the Game?
Who makes the rules? Why do I
always feel like I am losing?

I have thought about these ques-
tions quite a bit since that phone call a
few weeks ago. I don’t have any
conclusive answers, but I do have a
feeling that many students here are
playing the
Game and los-

The Game: a losing battle

Keeping up in the rat race

Now we can no longer blame
others for pressuring us to enter the
Race. College is the first time when
we are forced to take responsibility for
our own well-being. Sure, most of us
are financially dependent upon our
parents, and we still watch sitcoms,
rent movies, and read magazines.

But we are mature enough to start
realizing that the Race for the Unat-
tainable is the most stupid thing on
which we spend
our time. In run-

ing. Because the
Game is impos-

ning this Race,
our energy is de-

sible to win.

The major
component of the
Game is the Race. Some call it a “rat
race.” However, after hearing about
the rats on which the neuroscience lab
experiments and then kills, I will dig-
nify our race by referring to it as the
Race for the Unattainable.

Upon birth, we cry to make sure
our basic needs are met. We all com-
pleted this race, or we wouldn’t be

pleted, and our
identity seeps
out from our
pores with the blood, sweat, and tears
ittakes torun. So the rule of the Game
is that you have to incessantly attempt
to live up to the ideal that society sets.
And the cost for playing is your iden-
tity. As Iread last week’s Davidsonian
articles about masochism, the right to
complain about our lives and making
them appear worse than they are, and

we were. Maybe we heard this from
our parents, and we certainly internal-
ized this “quest for the best” from the
message that the media sends out.

As we entered high school, we
were threatened by lack of college
admittance letters and scholarship op-
portunities if we didn’t participate in
the Race for the Unattainable.

Living to build up our resumes is
not living. Our value as human beings
is not equal to our marketability after
college.

If we choose to use the metaphor
of the Game to describe our lives, we
at least owe it to ourselves to make our
own rules.
