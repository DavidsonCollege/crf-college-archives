Student Government

Davidson's student government,
with its enviable honor system, has
developed through the vears to the
extent that it is unexeelled by any
other. It has become a mode! which
many other schools have attempted
to emulate. Numerous requests for
information about our constitution
and organization come from all over
the country each vear.

Visitors to the campus have diffi-
culty in comprehending the success
of a system which relies wholly upon
the honesty and_integrity of the stu-
dents. Such customs as self-service
in the student store and examina-
tions being taken in the absence of
the professor amaze them. There
have naturally been occasional viola-
tions demanding the resulting severe

discipline, but on the whole the suc--

cess. of the system has been phe-
nomenal.

With many college organizations
facing the prospect of disintegration
due to the mass exodus of students
to the armed services, the student
government also faces a very crucial
period in the next few months. Only
one member of the newly elected stu-
dent council expeets lo Teturn to
school next fall, and all of the new
student body officers will have re-
sponded to the service call by June.
It will be necessary for those students

se . ° 4
remaining to choose an entirely new

student government administration.
Upon their shoulders will rest the re-
sponsibility of maintaining the high
standards of the honor system. This
will be extremely difficult with the
rapid turnover of students entering
‘school and leaving a few months.
} We trust that those who stay here
j will sense this responsibility and
exert all their influence toward the
thorough indoctrination of incoming
students as to the principles of our
student government. Those elected
to positions of leadership must be as
conscientious as those before them
have been in upholding the honor sys-
tem. If not, the whole system will
deteriorize rapidly, and the offenses
now controlled by the students them-
selves will necessarily revert to con-
trol by the ‘faculty. os

Davidson has come a long way in
the achievement of a really workable
student government. If lost now, it
would probably take years for it to
return again to the present stand-
ards. We urge you who will remain

at Davidson for a while yet to give

the student government vour full
support during these critical months
in order that it, along with other

cherished Davidson traditions, may

not be pushed aside and the good of
decades of work undone in a single

sear.

Baseball
In the absence of the regular sports

columnist this week, we would say a

ew words in praise of the Davidson

baseball team of 1943.. Through a.
tinotype mistake the “hapless” Wild-

cats were termed “hopeless” in last

week's issue. Although nearing the

end of a disastrous season, insofar

as seores are concerned, we would not

describe their efforts as hopeless nor

the time they have spent on the sport

wasted in any sense.

We admire the determination of
those who wanted to play ball this
year and went through with their
schedule in spite of the lack of sea-
soned veterans and in the face of the
sliffest competition a Davidson nine
has faced in several years. It was
advocated by some that the sport be
given up this year even after the
schedule had been arranged, it was
said that the team would bring dis-
credit ¢o Davidson's athletics. We
think there will be far more praise
of the spunk of the team for sticking
it out than unfavorable comment.

After all, the purpose of sports at
Davidson is, as it should be every-
where, to provide an opportunity for
as many as possible to benefit. from
tne exercise and team spirit of friend-

ee , : , rected, produced, and starred by Screen. As the story of the strug. wet them -+. ever, Retwning to all about it when you got inside and

is disheartening to see the alma .

mater go down-in defeat time after
time. But this is not the first time
that a Davidson team has carried
through against insurmountable
odds. They have been doing it for-
years. And even though it may be-

come necessary to suspend intercol- *

legiate sports altogether in the near
future, we hope that Davidson with
her indomintable spirit will be in
there with the last ones. We recall
General Douglas MacArthur's fam-
ous statement: “On the fields of
friendly strife are sown the seeds
that bear the fruit of victory.”
The Straight Of It

One of the primary requisites for
writing or commenting on news is
to get the facts correct. In the re-
cent student agitation over: the ques-
tion of athletics on Sunday, we made
a statement that should be corrected.
Reports, which we too hastily deem-
ed to be true, were circulated that
the’ town policeman, posted down at
the stadium on. Sunday afternoon,
had been running students away who
had intentions of engaging in sports
on the Sabbath. It has since been
pointed out that this law enforce-
ment officer was stationed there to
prevent out-of-town and other non-
student group who have been gather-
ing there from indulging in games

on Sunday on the campus, The of-. contained in- oar obstacle course. -~

such incidences that may have occur-

Mother Nature’s Easter outfit
certaiply was becoming, and made
a sharp contrast with the drab ap-
parel she had been sporting week-
ends. Even the birds seemed to
note the difference and chirped
happily about this beautiful day
that enabled them to display new
phanage and sing from the trees,
rather_than.-seck. their usual Sun-
day shelter under the dripping
caves.

Gosh, but wouldn't’ it be swell
