Cats take second in tournament

So-Con continued from page 1

maining, but Western had confer-
ence player of the year Frankie
King, who came alive. After scor-
ing 20 first-half points, King added
21 more, pulling the Catamounts
to within two points with 15 sec-
onds remaining and the ball. After
Williams blocked a shot with seven
seconds remaining, Western took
the ball out on the baseline. -But
point guard Chris Alpert stole the
inbounds pass and was fouled. To
seal the game, Alpert made both
free throws and Davidson escaped
with a 93-89 victory.

Williams finished with a ca-
reer-high 30 points along witha
team-high eight rebounds. Alpert
finished with 13 points and nine
assists while Narat remained con-
sistent, chipping in 18 points.

“We played with a lot of cour-
age and guts, with great emotion. It
was an outstanding basketball
game,” said McKillop.

This would set up a rubber
match against UT-Chattanooga, a
99-91 overtime victor over Geor-
gia Southern. This would be
Davidson’s first conference final
since the 1987 heartbreaker 66-64

loss to Marshall. It would also be
arematch from the 1986 final, when
center Gerry Born hit a 22-foot
jump shot at the buzzer to send
Davidson to the NCAA tourna-
ment.

People say there’s no better
basketball environment than a
conference tournament. Not many
would argue with the scene in the
Asheville Civic Center last night.
UT-C and Davidson would go toe-
to-toe, beginning to end, from tip
to the final buzzer, as hard as they
possibly could.

Davidson led most of the way,
taking a 38-35 halftime advantage
behind Brandon Williams' 12
points and Chris Alpert’s five as-
sists. Twice in the second half
Davidson led by five, but each
time they proved unable to extend.

With 4:22 remaining George
Spain gave Davidson a 64-61 ad-
vantage with a turnaround jumper.
The Cats would not score again.
Mark Donnelly came through huge
off the bench, picking up nine
points while putting down three
rebounds. Williams led with 14
points and nine boards.

In the closing seconds, con-
troversy sparked as the referees

continued to be consistently in-
consistent. Harwood was fouled
while shooting, but the referee ruled
the foul before the shot. With eight
seconds remaining, Davidson set
up a play to win the game. The
Cats had three shots, but none fell.
The final stood 65-64.

Though losses don’t get much
tougher than this one, this year’s
basketball team has absolutely
nothing to be down about. The
Davidson student section never sat
down because they were too ex-
cited. The way this team has per-
formed inspired everyone and re-
kindled a strong sense of school
spirit for basketball untouched in
some time.

Very few teams in the country
have won 22 games or more this
season, and we aren’t finished yet.
What players like Janko Narat and
Jason Zimmerman have done can-
not be thanked enough. They will
be remembered fondly by all of the
students and fans who watched
them while they played here at
Davidson. Though accurate to say
that the 1993-94 men's basketball
team will never be forgotten, we
mustremember that theseasonisn’t
over yet.

Women's hoops ends regu

By Neil Marks

The women’s basketball team
ended its regular season with a 90-
64 loss to a hot Marshall team,
which was playing off a huge win
over Furman.

Plagued with injuries, the team
started its yourigest ‘line-up ever
with three freshwomen and two
sophomores. Carolyn Kirsch led
all scorers with 15, while Amy
Scalcucci added 10. This wasn’t
enough, however, to overcome the
motivated Marshall team.

“We played pretty well in the
first half, but we started having
trouble breaking the press. We got
into a running game, which we
really shouldn’t have,” said
Scalcucci.

The team now looks ahead to
Thursday’s Southern Conference
tournament at Furman. As the
eighth seed, they will most likely
play top seeded Georgia Southern.

Injuries will again be a factor
for the tournament. Sophomore
Maggie Young has been out since
February with torn ligaments in

to play.

“We have lots of obstacles to
overcome. Maggie always gives
110 percent every time she steps
out on the court. She has so much
heart; and Erin is a huge offensive
threat. But people stepping off the
bench, like Amy who scored 10
and 15 points the last two games,
keep us going,” said Kirsch.

Even though Georgia South-
ern is the top seed, the Cats like
their chances in Thursday’s game.

“We played Georgia South-
ern twice and we played them close
both times. They say it’s hard to
beat a team three times, so we are
going to go in with the attitude that
we can win,” said Kirsch.

“We are building a team right
now. What’s most important to us
is that we give our all. Even though
we didn’t win a Southern Confer-
ence game this year, we built a
reputation in the league as the ‘hus-
tling Cats.’ We want to enter the
tournament with our heads high
and keep our reputation,” added
Kirsch.

season has been a tough one forthe
young but talented team.

“We have a lot to learn. We
are really young and we need to get
tougher and stronger. We have the
potential, though, and in a year or
two we couldbe atopcaliberteam,”
said sophomore Maggie Young.
