TENNIS TEAM TO BE CHOSEN
BY TOURNAMENT

In spite of the fact that Davidson lost
four of her best tennis players last year, the
Prospects of a good team for the coming year
are very favorable. Members of last year’s
fresh team are already getting in trim for
the coming tennis tournament, and are ex-
pected to be in the race for a place on this
year’s varsity team.

At present work is being done on the
courts. There is a good bit of grading and
packing to be done on them before they are
in good playing condition. New nets have
already been purchased. Captain L. M. Mc-
Cutchen is working on a schedule. The loss
of Price, Beall, Trotter and Staley handi-
caps the team greatly. From the number of
contenders out for places on this year’s team
it looks as if it will be just as strong as the
one last year.

Miss Ellen Black who is in training in
the Presbyterian Hospital, New York
City, is spending the month of Septem-
ber with her mother, Mrs. Emma Black,
on Concord Street.

Great Athlete Secured
In Coach Monk Mattox

Former Star on W. & L. Teams—
Coached at ‘= Tech Last
ear

This year’s Wildcat coaching staff has been
worthily supplemented by Marion Bruce
“Monk” Mattox, of Leesville, Va., who is
succeeding Clarence Rawson as Freshman
coach at Davidson. That Mattox is ably
qualified for the position is seen in the fact
that he was a star in the three major sports
at Washington and Lee University for four
years. As an end and a half in football, as a
guard on the basketball team, and as_short-
stop on the baseball team he made a name
for himself that will live for many years to
come. He is an all-round athlete in the
true sense of the word. Judging from this
past reputation, there is no doubt but that
Coach Mattox will justify every expectation
is his resuls with the Wild Kittens this year.

Since leaving Washington and Lee he has
devoted his entire time to athletics. For the
past year he has been one of the assistant
coaches at V. P. I., where he had played one
year of football during the first year of the
world war. During the past summer he has
been playing professional baseball with the
Greenwood Club of the Carolina League.
From all reports he was one of the ablest
catchers in the league.

TWO FRATERNITIES MOVE

tained quite a loss from fire last October and
had just completely renovated their hall,
this work being carried on in their new
local. Eight of the men have rooms in the
building and the entire chapter, except the
ones who are on the training table eat there.
Besides these sleeping quarters there are
the living room, kitchen, pantry and the
house mother’s apartment. This change of
the Phi Gamma Delta’s from their hall to
the South Street house was completed before
the opening of school.

The local chapter of the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon Fraternity moved last week from its
old home in the Eu hall to a house on South
Main street. This house, occupied last year
by the Lairds, has been completely renovated
and extensive repairs are still under way.
This house, together with an adjoining apart-
ment over Mayhew’s pressing club, serves as
a home for ten of the chapter and for the
house mother, Mrs, W. G. Graham, of Lau-
rens, S. C. In addition to the bed rooms,
others in the house include: a lounge room
with a connecting hall, the dining room,
kitchen and pantries and a meeting room.

The S. A. E.’s had been in Eu hall since
1916, when the room was allotted to them
by the college. Last spring when the an-
nouncement was made that houses would be
permitted, plans were made to have a house
this fall and at the same time keep their
present location until the first of next year.
However, notice was given last Friday by
the college authorities that the space was
needed so the movement of their properties
was completed.

The rooms vacated by these two fraterni-
ties will be used for literary society halls as
two of the societies are without a perma-
nent home.

| R. O. T.C. News

The officers of the Military Dept. are ex-
tremely gratified by the rapidity with which
the battalion has been organized and equip-
ped, and are well pleased with the appear-
ance of the battalion as a whole. Captain
Weems, head of the department at Davidson,
stated that a better organization was present-
ed at the first drill period this year than
was reached last year during the first month
ef drill.

A great many of the Freshmen have had
training in prep schools and elsewhere. Those
having had training before are showing up
well, but unfortunately, the others are more
backward than those of last year. The cadet
captains have been instructed to organize an
“awkward squad” for each company for the
purpose of giving special training to those
who find it hard to learn the movements. A
student is expected to learn faster in a small
unit than in a large one like the one of last
year.

The size of the R. O. T. C. unit is greater
this year than ever before, there being a
total of 403 students taking the basic course.
In addition to this number there are 56 ad-
vanced course students.

The cadet captains will choose the cor-
porals for their respective companies. In
fact a tentative list of corporals has already
been made out, but it will not receive the
final judgment of the officials until about
October 15. To those Sophomores selected
by their captains as corporals, thre will be
given additional credit on their semester
grades.

The problem of limiting the enrollment of
R. O. T. C. students is becoming grave. Gen-
eral Allen, Chief of Infantry, is also planning
to change the length of summer encampments
to a term of four weeks instead of six. This
change is due to the fact that one-third of
the funds appropriated to the R. O. T. C.
branch of service are necessary for the main-
tenance of summer camps. This is, as yet,
only a project but there must be an adjust-
ment soon, the exact nature of which will be
officially announced later.

MINISTERIAL BAND HAS FEED
SATURDAY NIGHT

The annual initial Ministerial Band feed
was held in the basement of the church Sat-
urday night. The primary object of this
social entertainment was to let the new men
get acquainted with the old men and thereby
imbibe some of the traditional spirit of the
Band at Davidson. The feed was character-
ized by its good eats and talks and fair at-
tendance. All of those who were present
received inspiration from the sincere talks
that were made. Ben Franklin was toast-
master and entertained the crowd with his
originality of expression. The principal
speaker of the evening was one of the Band’s
best friends, Dr. Arbuckle. His talk was
full of facts for the young ministers of Da-
vidson to think about. Then there were im-
promptu speeches by Stewart, Pritchett,
Goodykoontz, and Williford.

Bowie, the president of the Band, ended
the discussion with an inspiring message on
“A Yielded Life.”
