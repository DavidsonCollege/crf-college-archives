Hometown Records will open in Cornelius

By Ross Sloop

Forget all the thirty minute
pilgrimages we so frequently em-
bark upon to find albums at Repo
Records and Camelot Music down
in Charlotte.

Starting in early November
all of your favorite albums can be
found in a new record store that is
opening in Cornelius. According
to owner David Milsaps, Home-
town Records is due to open up
during the first week of Novem-
ber.

Milsaps is a local business-
man who grew up in Mooresville.
After many years working as a
contractor he has decided to leave
that career to open Hometown
Records. He has always held a
great interest in music, and in high
school he even played in a band
which did covers of Jimi Hendrix,

Jefferson Airplane, and the Dead.
Through his band Milsaps became
familiar with the Davidson Col-
lege campus thanks to Shaw Smith
Sr. When Smith was director of
the College Union he frequently
invited Milsaps’ band to play in
the 900 Room.

Milsaps is now wanting to
make a new connection with the
students of Davidson, not through
the music of his band but through
the music of Hometown Records.
He sees Cornelius as an excellent
location for his store because it
will be so accessible to the many
music lovers of this campus.
Knowing that Davidson students
enjoy a variety of musicians,
Milsaps says that his store will be
stocked with a wide range of art-
ists. One willbe able to findevery-
thing from rock to rap, classical to

new age.

Music will not be the only
thing to be found at Hometown
Records. Wanting to keep abreast
of upcoming technology Milsaps
says he hopes to stock a selection
of Laserdiscs. With the opening of
Hometown Records people in the
North Mecklenburg area will also
have easy access to tickets for all
their favorite musical perfor-
mances.

Milsaps says that his store has
already been approved for a
Ticketmaster license which will
allow his store to sell tickets for
upcoming concerts in the Char-
lotte area,

David Milsaps emphasizes the
fact that Hometown Records will
be a record store that sells at dis-
count prices. People can expect to
see prices competitive with the

bargains offered at Repo Records
and other discount stores. Milsaps
also says to look for special cou-
pons and occasional discounts es-
pecially for Davidson students. The

store should open up in the coming
weeks across from the Rainbow
Deli. Socome home to Hometown
Records and satisfy your music
needs.

Kravitz fans honor the politician of peace and musical inspiration

the Freedom Train/Comeon dance
on the freedom train/Uh huh.” With
a cry of “But I’m always on the
run,” he moved right into an in-
credible version of “Mama Said.”
For this one, a few men dressed in
"Sanford and Son" leather loung-
ing jackets and berets punctuated
the music with horns.

Kravitz knew how to play his
audience, knew just how much the
audience could take before need-
ing a rest. The lights went down,
and he got out his acoustic guitar
for “My Precious Love.” This
song seemed to drag on too long,

but he then played the wonderful
“Heaven Help” and “Sister” from
his latest album. Lenny’s voice
was raw with emotion against the
guitar, and these two songs ad-
equately showcased his voice.
Annoyingly, couples nearby be-
gan to make out, and one of my
companions threw an empty cup at
one couple. She succeeded in
breaking up the public display; of
affection. Just as.the crowd was
gettinga little mellow, Lenny burst
out with a playful “Mr. Cab Driver”
from his first album. He continued
with “Flower Child.”

Up to this point, Lenny had
not said much to the audience. But

before playing “Let Love Rule,”
he asked the crowd, “I don’t know
what the rules are—I don’t want to
mess anybody’s program up, but
can’t y’all get any closer?
Nobody’s down here in front.”
Thenhesangslowly, “Lovvvwve...”
and the first few notes of “Let Love
Rule” began. During this song,
Lenny shared his peace-loving
piles y in somewhat vague
terms w: the audience. “Are we
ready tobecome one this evening?
They don’t want us to be together.
They want wars, and negativity.

Are we ready to doourown thing?”
Lenny wasn’t clear on who “they”

might be, but apparently, becom-

As the

ing “one” meant jumping into the
audience and running around.
What a politician of peace.

He left the stage, then returned
for an encore which began with the
beautiful and haunting “Believe.”
He followed this with his latest hit,
“Are You Gonna Go My Way,”
continuing to rock the audience
relentlessly. It was close to 11:45
when the concert was finally over.

The acoustics in Independence
Arena aren’t the best. Sometimes
the music seemed overly loud and
sharp, especially during Blind
Melon’s set. But for the most part,
Lenny Kravitzsounded very good.
With the help of his back-up band,
which included three members with
foot-high afros, Kravitz put on a
good show. He was able to repro-
duce his songs with studio accu-
racy, and ona few occasions, I felt
like I was listening to letter-perfect

versions of his songs. At other
times, he was content tojam on his
guitara little more. Without doubt,
Kravitz had a good rapport with
the audience, and was an animated
and energetic entertainer. Hardly
any. of Kravitz’s songs are nega-
tive, which reflects his personal
philosophy well. “I think music
can influence people,” Kravitz has
said. “People have to carry out the
action, but I think music can help.
It can put the message out, and it
can inspire people to change the
world.” ‘

Although some critics com-
plain that Kravitz is unoriginal, I
believe that he works with his in-
fluences to create music that’s
very much his own. He is a tal-
ented songwriter and musician, and
the concert at Independence Arena
proved that he is a great performer
as well.

Oscars on the way for "Innocence"

in which they live, the couple are
relegated to quick kisses in the
back of carriages and glances
across crowded rooms. The way
these scenes are presented, though,
are more erotic than any graphic
displays of people bumping uglies.

The performances by Day-
Lewis, Pfeiffer, and Ryder are all
outstanding and an excellent sup-
porting cast rounds out this rich
production beautifully. In addi-
tion to the wonderful portrayals by
the actors, Scorsese goes further in
exploring the rigidity of this world
by showing the formality of New

York society mirrored in how these
people eat, dress, and talk— these
nuances reveal that the characters
are themselves prisoners of a
lifestyle that they cherish. There
are so many levels to this movie
that sometimes it can become con-
fusing; Scorsese injects narration
by Joanne Woodward to clear up
the more complex scenes. In any
case, if the storyline isnot appeal-
ing to you then just watch the
rich cinematography is entertain-
ment in itself. Scott says head to
the theater en masse to see “The
Age of Innocence” - this one is a
definite winner that you’1l be hear-
ing a lot of again come Oscar time.
