Who Heads Davidsonian?

Lloyd Chapin

Free from political and com-
mercial pressures, a college jour-
nal enjoys an independence of ex-
pression denied to the regular city
newspaper. Thus, the Davidsonian,
unmuzzled by any form of faculty
or trustee cen-
sorship, is par-
; ticularly well-
| fitted for its
tole. as both
ithe bearer of
‘truth through
factual news
stories and the
interpreter of
that truth
through intelli-
gent editorials.

If elected editor, | would ta-
bor to create 8 newspaper
‘whose high standards of ac-
curacy, integrity, and courage

would make its voice both
heard and respected.

The measure of service which a
newspaper renders to its readers
depends absolutely upon the ac-
curacy of the information it sup-
plies. Realizing this the David-
sonian, during the past year, has
attempted to make its news cov-
erage more complete and accurate
than ever before. I would encour-
age this trend.

LITERARY QUALITY
It is also true that the task of] ished by outside sources. |years, and particularly under the|state Uhelr Case is also true that the task of

a newspaper is to tell the news
as
stances warrant,
the truth.

To meet this need for high-
er literary quality, ! propose
to hold a series of meetings
during the year with report-
ers, both individually and col-
lectively, for the purpose of
teaching them, not only how
to get the facts, but how to
present them with brightness
and zest.

Appearance can make or break
a newspaper. Overcrowded, un-
balanced, gray pages can frighten
away the most curious reader.

My make-up policy would in-
volve, therefore, a greater vari-
ation in headline type, and a more
spacious arrangement of news-
print. More extensive use of
action photos on both the news
and sports pages: would ‘contribute
to a more animated and powerful
presentation.

Sports are an important
part of the Big Picture at Da-
vidson. Because of the fimite-
tions of weekly publication,
the actual results of athletic
contests are often well knewn
before the cempus paper ep-
pears. There is a need, how-
ever, for statistical and per-
sonal information not fur-
nished by outside sources.

NOT WORTHWHILE?

Many Students Criticize
Winter Services Values

In making an evaluation

of Winter Services, the Con-

tinuation Committee has found that student reaction sharply

divided.

The most outstanding fact dis-
covered in the poll was ‘the diver-
sity of opinion in regard to religi-
ous emphasis week. Less than
50% of those polled felt that the
services were worthwhile.

In answer to the first question
(In your opinion was the time
spent on the Winter Services

worthwhile?) the results were as;—

‘Davidson Is Host To

follows:

Yes _.. 42.5%

No 37.9%

No opinion ._.... 20 %

Furthermore, the majority of

those polled did not feel that
their concept of the Christian
faith had been improved. Ques-
tion: “Have the Winter Services
increased your understanding of
the Christian faith?”

Yes . a. 933.2%

No _........—- 57.5%

No opinion 9.3%

ADEQUATE PUBLICITY
However, the student body

seemed to be satisfied for the
most part that there was ade-
quate publicity. The question:
“Do you think there was ade-
quate publicity?”

Yes . 80.5%
No .... . 15.9%
No opinion 3.6%

Although many students said
the topics chosen were appropri-
ate there was a large number of
reservations and reluctant yes’s.
Others did not consider them at

all relevant. Question: “Did you
feel that the topics discussed
were relevant and appropriate.”

Yes . 49,2%

No —............. 33.0%

No opinion 17.8%

Some of the topies were changed
because of the failure of Dr. Blake
to arrive; this was noted by many
of the students questioned.
ACADEMIC WORK
Almost al! of the students who
were in any way interested in the
Winter Services felt that the
academic work hindered them.
Question: “Did your academic

work interfere with your partici-|

pation in the Winter Services?”

Yes 10.1%

No 25.3%

No opinion 4.6%
Many expressed very strong

It was generally felt that if
there was any benefit derived
from these services, it was pri-
marily intellectual. Question: “Has
the benefit (if any) of these serv-
ices been spiritual or intellect-
ual?”

One encouraging fact was that
30% said that they were interest-
ed in some sort of follow up such
as a study group.

Only 4.5% said they were op-
posed to any opinions expressed
by the speakers during the week.

Residential Seminars

Davidson College will be host
to “The Residential Seminars on
World Affairs” March 21-24. The
Seminar, an agency of the Fund
for Adult Education, will meet
to devote three days to an in-
tensive survey of the continuing
issue of relations between the
United States and the Soviet
Union.

Although these sessions will be
held in the Union, unfortunately,
due to the nature and informality
of the discussions, they will not
be open to the public.

“The Residential Seminars on
World Affairs” are part of a “spe
cialized program of _ intensive
study of world affairs questions
designed in subject, method, and
participation for those people who
hold positions of influence in
shaping public policy and public
thought in international relations,
especially those engaged profes-
sionally in some aspect of citizen
education in world affairs.”

Each Seminar is limited in the
number of participants, and many
outstanding educators, newspaper
editors, radio and television news
analysts and commentators,
authors, lecturers, business lead-
ers, and other persons in position
to influence the shaping of public
thought in international affairs
will take part in the program.

Mid-April Marriage

The engagement of Miss Ade-

walt was announced recently by
her mother, Mrs. William Hender-
son Hill of Jackson, Mississippi.

Dr. Ostwalt, a member of the
college faculty for the past sev-
eral years, is currently serving as
a visiting professor at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill.

EDITORIAL POLICY

current information. It may, like
a phonograph or radio, collect and
disseminate thought as well as in-
formation, but having no thought
of its own it is without vitality or

Those who have followed the

the type of coverage I favor—
stress on coming events, con-
densed coverage of past ones and
emphasis particularly on inter-
fraternity competition. I-F basket-
ball statistics should be continued
and should, if possible, be ex-

1 propose an All-Southern

be selected by polling the
sports writers of the papers

colleges.

General news reporting should
be accurate and factual and
should come from as many sources
as possible. It should bear no
editorial evaluations whatsoever.

In every way the Davidsonian
should continue to grow as the
voice of the students, not only
to bring the views of the campus

purpose of the Davidsonian.

For this reason, it is only fair
that one who offers his services
for Editor should state his in-
tentions in candid frankness. -Let
us, therefore, analyze briefly the
newspaper from three sides: (1)
news; (2) editorials; and (3) sports.

need for stop signs at numerous

junction of Potts and Catawba

trip variety at the corner of Main

“Right turns on red lights at
‘T’ intersections could be autho-
rized,” stated the report, but the
“U-turn practices on Main Street
and parking violations will have
to be discontinued.”

Corrections would include sev-
eral curve warnings and the im-
provement of safety zones in

er an unlimited opportunity to
gather and convey the facts
as they happen.

Close cooperation with the stu-
dent council, full coverage of its
meetings, as well as quotes, in-
terviews, opinion polls, and rov-
add

of campus events will add use-
fulness to the newspaper.
EDITORIAL POLICY

Because the editorial page must
reflect in bold and vivid terms

and as the edi-|the opinions of both the Editor
torial voice of|and of independent writers, it is

separated into two divisions: (a)
the regular editorial columns, and
(b) the remaining five columns on
the editorial page.

In the reguler editorial col-
umns, our policy shall be to
take definite stands on all
major campus issues. The suc-
cessful campaign to change
the A.B. requirements is
proof of the potency of the
press and of student opinion.

Moreover, we shall speak out on
all vital national, political, and
economic issues—taking a moder-
ate conservative position, realiz-
ing, of course, that no Editor’s
views are infallible.

The remaining five columns
will continue to emphasize letters
to the editor, home-grown car-
toons, inquiring reporter type
articles, and opinion features
from all segments of the student
body. In short, these columns will
be a ready forum for all student
opinion.

FULL SPORTS COVERAGE

A good sports page should give
complete and fair coverage to
both our intercollegiate and in-
tramural program. The continued
use of photographs and personal
features, along with vital statistics
and box score standings will give
the reader a wide summary of Da-
vidsonian sports.

More emphasis, however,
should be placed on gether-
ing and printing ‘scoops’
about our opponents, on in-
quiring reporter type articles,
on write-ups of future games,
and on interviews with the
players. Nemes make the
news, both in sports and in
news articles.

Finally, allow me to say that if
selected as next year’s Editor, 1
shall carry forward many of the
improvements made by the
present administration, and shall
also institute new ones. Regard-
less of the outcome, I pledge my
continued work and support for
the Davidsonian.
