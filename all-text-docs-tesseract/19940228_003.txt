CBS correspondent, Davidson
alum reveals cynicism of media

By Court McBryde

Tonya Harding’s skating saga,
Joey Buttafuoco and Amy
Fischer’s violent love affair, and
midget wrestlers on sexual perver-
sion are examples of recent CBS
News stories that CBS Correspon-
dent Robert D. Faw shared the
Davidson community last Mon-
day.

Faw, the final speaker of the
Dean Rusk Program’s four-day

conference on “Conscience.and _

Foreign Policy,” lectured on “The
Media and Foreign Policy.” He
focused on the present news
trend—entertainment.

Faw contends that foreign
events are covered less today by
newspapers and networks because
“foreign news has turned inward
and isn’t as sexy.” The objective
for networks and newspapers now
is to make the viewer react.

Faw describes the role of the
news as an entertainer as both “our
fault and yours.” He is troubled by
the values pertaining to the deci-
sion-making process as to which
stories make the news but admits,
“{We] can’t cover the news in
twenty-two minutes.”

According to Faw, in the com-
petition for the attention of con-
-sumers, “ratings are the ultimate
yardstick." Viewers want to watch
‘something entertaining, and “new
~ news” is taking over the function
of the industry of journalism.

Faw emphasizes the fact that
although the media tries to utilize
the “power of the image,” this
emphasis alone does not shape for-
eign policies. .

Footage of the bloody mar-
ketplace in Sarajevo has been
beamed into American homes for
months but, according to Faw, has
affected nochangesin policies con-
cerning the Balkans.

The role of conscience in the
media is, to Faw, a minor one be-
cause one person’s conscience can
have only a limited impact. In the

changing world order, he says, get-.
ting the truth of news is growing ©

tougher.

During his speech, Faw told
political jokes and amusing news
stories, demonstrating his point

about the media: cater to your au-
dience.

Faw, a 1966 Davidson gradu-
ate, currently works on the CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather.

Homosexuality stems
from biological basis

By Rachel Dunifon

“Of course there is a biologi-
cal basis for homosexuality,” con-
cluded Dr. Don Kimmel. At the
same time he questioned, “But why
do we care if there is or not?” The
Friends of Lesbians and Gays
(F.L.A.G.) sponsored Kimmel’s
lecture on the biological basis of
homosexuality last Tuesday.

After an introduction by
F.L.A.G. President David Haslam,
Kimmel expressed how happy he
was to see an organization like
F.L.A.G. on campus. He then
launched into a discussion of what
he termed “sexual variations”
among individuals, emphasizing
his belief that sexuality is not black-
and-white, but a continuum.

To support this assertion,
Kimmel discussed the primitive
condition of our evolutionary an-
cestors who had a sexual status he
characterized as “confused.”
Lower organisms today, similar to
those from whom we evolved, of-
ten either change sex or contain
aspects of both sexes.

Kimmel went on to explain
his argument against the conten-
tion that homosexuality is not
“natural.” He listed numerous
mammals, including apes, mon-
keys, lions, elephants, and cows,
who have been observed exhibit-
ing instances of homosexual be-
havior. Kimmel noted that such
behavior is often beneficial and

_ life-preserving to these animals in

establishing territory and domi-
nance. Even humans go through

_ the first five to seven weeks of

their prenatal lives as ambisexuals
who could “go either way” sexu-
ally. (

Most biological homosexual-
ity research involves human male
brains. An area of the hypothala-
mus, a small region in the back of
the brain, is believed to regulate
male heterosexual behavior and is
larger among males than females.

The research of Simon LeVay
brought homosexuality into this
picture. While studying the brains

ofalzheimer patients, Le Vay found
that nuclei in the hypothalamus
were twice as large in heterosexual
men as in homosexual men and
women. Furtherresearch by LeVay
demonstrated statistically signifi-
cant differences between homo-
sexual and heterosexual male
brains.

Kimmel warned the audience
to be careful in interpreting this
data, as LeVay’s research hascome
under some criticism. Some re-
searchers question the subjectivity
of his study, the small sample size
he used, and the lack of informa-
tion about the sexual history of the
subjects whom he presumed to be
heterosexual.

Kimmel concluded by cau-
tioning the audience about the dan-
gers of categorizing people by
terms such as heterosexual, homo-
sexual, or bisexual. “This does
terrible things for individual dif-
ferences,” he warned. He hopes to
see research about homosexuality
change so that it no longer seeks a
biological explanation for accept-
ing people who are considered to
be “different.”

“If we really believe some of
the precepts upon which our na-
tion was built, we would be accept-
ing of everybody .. . regardless of
whether their behavior is biologi-
cally-based, environmentally-
based, or both,” Kimmel said.

Studies such as LeVay’s should
not, according to Kimmel, be a
factor in determining whether or
not a group of people is accepted.
Several members of the
Davidson community will further
discuss issues involving sexuality
and will answer questions cover-
ing a wide range of topics at an

upcoming F.L.A.G. forum entitled

“Coming Out Straight and Gay:
Exploring Sexuality,” which will
be held at 8 p.m. on March 14.
Anyone having any questions
relating to F.L.A.G. is encouraged
to write to P.O. Box 1325. Corre-
spondence remains confidential.
