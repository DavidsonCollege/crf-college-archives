Work-study

Ask not what your college can do for you, but
what you can do for your college 3

By JULIE ZIMMERMANN

Work-study plays a
prominent role in the lives of
many Davidson students.
Some give as many as 15
hours a week to various as-
pects of the college. The
Davidsonian interviewed
several work-study employ-
ees to get the inside scoop on
their jobs.

Computer services center:
Contrary to popular belief,

munity come to at one time or
another. Sophomore Lynnette
Suawanasri said, “This is a place
where I’ve meta lot of people that
I normally never would have
come into contact with at all.”
Working at the CSC is not all
work. There apparently are only
certain times when the center is
very busy, enabling work-study
students to do their own studying.
One thing that many people donot
realize, however, is that at busy
times, the work-study students do
not have priority. When Humes
papers or term papers are due, and

your homework.” A word to the
wise, be careful what you_aék the
work-study students to do; there is
an Honor Code.

The Union:

Sophomore’ Dibrelle Howard
works as a Union house manager.
Her duties include supplementing
staff help, watering plants, help-
ing with the recycling efforts,
acting as a liaison. between the
Union and Chambers, setting up
meetings, starting the movies,
and being in charge of money and
keys to the various rooms.

Sharma said she loves her job. “It
is the right distance from every-
thing. The Union is always bus-

ing, keeping track of the Union
supervisor and director, knowing
about: all the upcoming events,
taking lamination orders, giving
change, calling people about their
packages, selling cinema tickets
(For those who do not know, the
Union sells tickets to most movie
theaters for $3.50, a big savings
form the usual $5.00 ticket
price!), selling The Charlotte Ob-
server, forwarding long distance
calls, and giving out information
to perspective students.

The Union can be busy, but
Sharma said that she can gener-
ally find a half hour to
study. One of the draw-
backs of working in the
Union, however, is that
someone must always
be there until 1:00 a.m.
even on weekends. The
work-study _ students
have devised a rota-
tional system for the
weekend shifts.

Sharma voiced
one major. complaint.
“Everyone on campus
was given a directory.
Why don’t they use, it

asked,

College Relations: _-

This office is responsible for all
the publications that come out to
the college, such as the directory
and course descriptions guide.
Junior Lisa Jackson finds her job
there to be a vital part of her
“Davidson Experience.”

“I’m getting real life experi-
ence which I think employers are
going to look for more, instead of
somebody who gets out with justa
degree,” said Jackson. “It’s excit-
ing, it’s alive.”

Jackson summed up an impor-
tant aspect of the program by
Stressing the benefits of her job
beyond payment. “I think I have
learned more at work that in all
the rest of my college career be-
cause here I’ve learned how to
work with other people better. It’s
definitely helped my writing and
speaking abilities,” she said.

Admissions office:

Senior April Loving believes
working in this office is “one of
the more interesting jobs.” In the
course of her job, she has learned
the true nature of the admissions
process. “It is, more than GPA,
SATs, and. recommendations,”
she said.

One of the aspects that she
loves i is that she gets a feel for the
entering class before the new, stu-
dents even arrive. In addition, the
job. has taught her responsibility
