National women’s team
kicks Finland around

By Matt Pitzer
Sports Editor

The U.S. women’s national
team showed once again why it is
one of the best teams in the world,
completely dominating Finland 6-
0 in an exhibition Sunday after-
noon at Richardson Field.

SOCCER

Five different players scored
for the U.S., and Finland added to
its humiliation by scoring on them-
selves.

The game was the first ever
featuring a world champion at
Davidson.“‘I think we finished our
chances much better,” head coach
Tony DiCicco said. “When you
finish your chances, everyone is
more confident.”

Sunday’s game was the sec-
ond in a five-game series The U.S.
is in the middle of preparation to
defend its world title at the World
Championships this summer in
Sweden.

Friday night in Atlanta, the -

U.S. topped Finland 2-0. In that
game, the U.S. dominated play as

well, but had more trouble putting -

the ball in the net.

One of the stars Sunday for
the U.S. was 17-year-old Tiffany
Roberts from San Ramon, Calif.
The high school senior controlled
much of midfield play with her
blinding speed and athletic ability.

“She’s a star now,” DiCicco
said. “A.nd she’s just going to con-
tinue to get better. She’! get better
technically, and she’ll become
more of a scorer.”

Roberts admits feeling the”

pressure of playing fora world title
at such a young age.

“Friday, we saw glimpses of what we could do;
Sunday, it was there for the whole 90 minute.”

“People have expectations of

‘this team,” she said. “I just hope I

can fulfill those expectations.”
The U.S. is in the midst of its
preparation for its title defense,
which it first won in 1991 in China.
There, Michelle Akers was one of
the stars for the women. In fact,
she scored the U.S.’s two goals in
the final, a 2-1 win over Norway.
Since then she has been diag-
nosed with Epstein Barr syndrome
and has been fighting back ever
since. Epstein Barr is a virus that
causes mononucleosis and is asso-
ciated with various types of can-
cer. The disease obviously saps
Akers strength and endurance.

_ She is well on her way to re-
covery now and says that she is at
about 90%of full strength.

“By the time Sweden rolls
around,” she said, “‘I’ll be as good

as it gets.”

_On this glorious Sunday after-
noon, the U.S. women showed off
some of the best soccerinthe world.

' Akers, Mia Hamm and Kristine

Lilly showed why they are some of
the best players with fantastic
moves and dazzling goals.

“Friday, we saw glimpses of
what we could do,” Akers said.
“(Sunday), it was there for the
whole 90 minutes.”

Lilly opened the scoring in the
25th minute witha sensational goal.
Dribbling just outside the 18-yard
penalty box on the left side, she
faked toward the middle of the
field, throwing off the defender.

Then, she pulled the ball back
and fired a shot off her left foot that
beat the Finnish goalie. Paulina
Miettinen played a fine game in
goal for the Finns, making 12 shots

as the U.S. outshot Finland 32-8.
But she didn’t get nearly enough
help from her defense.

In the 35th minute, Akers, .

helped the U.S. reach the halftime
score of 2-0 when she put in a
rebound of a Mia Hamm shot from
about 10 yards out.

- In the second half, the wheels
fell off for Finland starting with an
own goal in the 71st minute. A
Finnish player was trying to pass
back to her goalie, but ended up
putting a nice little shot in the back
of the net.

Natalie Neaton scored in the
74th minute and Julie Fowdy struck
in the 77th minute. Hamm fin-
ished off the scoring with one of
her own in the 86th minute.

Baseball bounced from tournament

By Matt Pitzer
Sports Editor

The baseball team went into
the Southern Conference tourna-
ment last weekend in Charleston
with hopes of a big upset.

BASEBALL

After all, the team had reason-
able success this season against
the class of the conference, includ-
ing two wins in three games against
Georgia Southern, and wins against
two ACC teams: Duke and Wake
Forest.

But upsets were not to be in
this tournament as the Wildcats
dropped their first two games and

were bounced from the tournament.

Two of the team’s brightest
stars this season were honored fot
their achievement.

Pitching ace Chris Pollard and
offensive leader Gus Quattlebaum
were named second team All-
Southern Conference.

Pollard got one of nine votes
for Pitcher of the Year, while coach
Dick Cooke received one vote for
Coach of the Year.

In the squad’s first game,
Thursday afternoon against East
Tennessee State, Davidsonran into
a tough Jay Hensley on the hill for
the Buccaneers and fell 6-2.

Pollard went the distance for
the Wildcats, allowing 13 hits over
the nine innings. Only four of the
runs he allowed were earned.

_ In the first inning, Davidson
jumped ahead 1-0 when Jeff
Andrews tripled and scored on

Brian Penny’s infield hit.
Hensley then shut down the
Wildcats, retiring 16 of the next 17
batters. The one hitter that did
reach got to first on a walk and was
promptly caught stealing.
Davidson got some of its of-
fense back in the seventh when
Leo Dozier, running for
Quattlebaum, scored on a wild
pitch. Quattlebaum had two hits in
the game, as did Brad Edwards.
Britton Phelps had a home run
for ETSU and Len Hart had three
hits and two RBI. With the loss,
the Wildcats fell into the losers

. bracket of the tournament and had

to play Marshall on Friday.

The Thundering Herd rolled
over Davidson, taking an 8-5 win
and ending the Wildcats tourna-
mentrun. Jonathan Coulombe ab-
sorbed the loss Friday for the Wild-
cats.

Edwards gave Davidson an
early 3-0 lead with a three-run
homer in the first inning.

After Marshall climbed back
into the lead at 4-3, Jeff Coker
knocked in two more runs to put
Davidson back on top 5-4 in the
sixth inning.

In the seventh, though, the
Thundering Herd scored three runs
to climb on top for good. Mike
Hagy, Joel Torcolini and Marshall
Henry each had two RBI for
Marshall.

Despite the tournament loss,
the team’s season isn’t quite over.

The Wildcats hit the field again
Wednesday afternoon, hosting
UNC-Asheville. Thursday,
Davidson plays host to Winthrop
before traveling to Richmond fora
weekend series. The team con-
cludes its season May 9 with a
home game against UNCC.

Jordan
|gives NBA
some
much-
needed
excitement |

By Matt Pitzer

For those of you who didn’t
notice, the NBA season started
Thursday night.

ACCORDING TO

SCHOON

Its official name is the 1995
NBA Playoffs, since the league
had its annual ridiculous and point-
less regular season, which it keeps
since teams like the L.A. Clippers
and the Washington Bullets must
actually play some games.

Of course, there really is only
one interesting and compelling
story this season, and that is some
guy named MJ.

He proved once again that he
is the Best Player Ever Friday night
by absolutely dominating the sup-
posedly-good Charlotte Hornets by
exploding for a typical 48-point
night.

There is no question that the
Chicago Bulls went from also-ran
to NBA title contender in the same
amount of time that it took Jordan
to say, “I’m back.”

And he’Il probably do it again
and again and again until he takes
the Bulls to the NBA Finals and an
NBA title.

And there’s really no way to
stop him.

People have talked endlessly
about how he, along with Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird, helped
save the league from impending
doom, and that the league was just
waiting for another similar star to
come along.

Which is exactly why every-
one got so happy when Shaquille
O’Neal came along and dunked a
lot.

But there’s something decid-
edly unoriginal about Shaq. Sure
he dunks. Sometimes he gets a
reverse dunk ora backwards layup.
Sometimes he’ll come in with a
slightly difference hairstyle.

Butit’s always about the same
thing.

And that is the story of the
NBA.

It gets old, it gets boring, and
it gets repetitive.

Quickly.

That is why some of us make
it a point to avoid the NBA during
the regular season, except to see
how Georghe Muresan is doing.

The league, led by commis-
sioner David Stern, has made such
a point to be on the cutting edge of
