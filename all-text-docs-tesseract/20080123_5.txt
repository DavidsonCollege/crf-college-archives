This smooth, successful party per-

Spirits were high Friday evening
as many first-year students cele-
brated their return to campus by
joining a Patterson Court organiza-
tion. Absent from the festivities,
however, were a large number of
“independent” students.

Many independents find social
structure similar to that offered by
a PCC organization in other groups
around campus. Jonathan Matlin

Guest Editorial

Max Schreber, disgusted by peers.

I love knowledge but hate
school. By government decree, my
parents subject me to the daily
social and physical abuse that is
freshman year at Joseph Dalton
Hooker High for a carbuncular Red
Alert grandmaster. The marginal
teaching abilities of the faculty in
no way compensate for the social
fascism I endure. I want out.

Tam an only child, a rogue war-
rior if you will, and it has been over
9,800 hours since I had a face-to-
face interaction with anyone out-
side of class.

I could enhance my education,
expand my mind, develop leader-
ship skills and enhance my social
network without ever leaving my
room, aka the Bat Cave. Reaping
the benefits of technology, I am
building the brain and hands neces-
sary to reach success in the virtual
workplace I will enter in 2014.

The virtues of team sports are a
moot point, as glandular trolls have
cut me from every swinish herd of
philistines I have ever been
acquainted with. Besides, what
advantage does physical strength
have in today's world? No one will
ever be as strong as my 260 giga-
byte hard drive, or as fast as my
broadband connection.

Court Selection Night Runs
Smoothly for Indepedents

"11 explained, “I went to the first-
and second-night down parties but
didn't really bother to participate in
rush beyond that. After I didn't get
a bid to an on-campus fraternity, I
figured the Eco House would be a
decent second choice.”

Other independents cite a prosa-
ic and repetitive cross-Court
playlist as a deterring factor.
Junior independent Katie Kinsall
complained, “By November I was
absolutely sick of both “Soulja
Boy” and “Sweet Caroline” (tech-
no remix).

Kinsall hosted a well-attended
independent party at her off-cam-
pus residence. Independent party-
goers reported “drink selections
other than Beast, cool new music,”
and a party that lasted well past
2:00 a.m.

Please Send me to my Room!

My competitive activity occurs
within the dimension of my 45" flat
screen TV, where my Halo 3 gamer
tag MaXpAyne99 has achieved the
rank of grade-2 brigadier.

Such status garners respect from
online comrades, who look to me
for guidance when engaged in
combat. I utilize my wireless head-
set to outline battle tactics, orches-
trate counters, and motivate team-
mates. With each game of Slayer, I
further develop my keen sense of
team dynamic. I have secured vic-
tories with blood-hungry head
cases, self-interested kill-hogs, and
risk-averse pansies. Their virtual
will become my reality as I adapt
my web-warrior skills into real
world assets further down the eth-
emet cord.

Hooker High is a nether-realm of
jockstraps and lip-gloss where I
restrain myself from asking pene-
trating questions for fear of the
lunch hour wedgies they elicit.
How can I befriend other learning
enthusiasts and gain social skills
without human interaction, an out-
dated computer illiterate might ask.

Well, Mavis Beacon recently
clocked me at 220 flawless words-
per-minute, allowing me to mar-
shal more than 20 chatrooms at
once. (When I do look down at my
keypad, it is only to admire the
flow and precision of my key-
strokes.)

My social outlet is My Space. I
have amassed over 1400 friends,
many of whom constantly write
touching blurbs on my wall. You
could call me a digital butterfly.

While the jocks and plastics
have the classroom, I will be learn-
ing the way of the future. Mom,
please send me to my room!

Kris Kringle Busted for DUI

holding cell after he was detained at the Canadian border at 2:30 am.

Canadian police have charged an
unidentified man with a second-
degree felony for driving an unreg-
istered sleigh on an expired license
and heavily under the influence the
night of Monday, December 24th.

An officer's breathalyzer indicat-
ed that he had been operating his
1,500-pound sled with a Blood
Alcohol Content of 0.25. When
asked to walk a straight line, he
attempted to bribe the officers with
X-Box 360s, Fatheads and a
Teletubby.

Two of the reindeer drawing his
sleigh, identified by their collars as
“Dasher” and “Blitzen,” were
found to have traces of alcohol in
their systems. Police believe the
suspect to be a one Santa Claus,
aka Saint Nicholas, Father
Christmas or Kris Kringle.

Mr. Claus claims he started his
bender with two shots of
Jaegermeister in Munich at rough-
ly 11:00 pm on the night of the
24th, followed with three Irish Car
Bombs in Boston an hour later and

two Singapore Slings “somewhere
in Asia” at 2:00am.

His information is compromised
by the fact that a Saskatchewan
state trooper claims to have found
him doing donuts on a frozen pond
two miles outside of Prince Albert
at 11:53 p.m. on the night of the
24th.

Mr. Claus inadvertently
informed police of further criminal
infractions, this time breaking and
entering-when he claimed that all
the alcohol he consumed was.
obtained from private residences
he had entered via chimney.

Although he claims to know the
families who provided the alcohol,
in his intoxicated state he could
neither remember names or
addresses.

Police suspect that Mr. Claus,
who is rumored to use several
international aliases, is involved in
a black market plastic toy cartel
run out of Istanbul, as well as a
slave labor ring somewhere north-
west of Greenland.

Eating Houses Introduce New
Fragrance: “Condoment”

In a rare display of complete col-
laboration, all four of the eating
houses introduced a new self-selec-
tion-specific perfume last Friday.

According to Connor House
president Annie Huddle, the new
fragrance is the result of extensive
market research. “We've known
for years that more hook-ups
occurred on self-selection night
than any other, but we never knew
why,” Huddle said. “Finally, we
put two and two together.”

A team of researchers from the
four eating houses has attributed
the single-night spike in the cam-
pus’ sexual activity to the libido-
intensifying effects of the mixed
condiments.

“Someway, somehow, the blend
of aromas ignites a fire inside those
little boys,” said Turner self-selec-

tion chair Amber Bacardi.

The specific ingredients of the
perfume will change each year,
with the debut scent combining the
condiments used by all the eating
houses, including ketchup, mus-
tard, barbeque sauce, honey,
chocolate syrup, mayonnaise, and
many others.

“We had to take advantage of
this phenomenon,” Bacardi said.
“Now the girls can be irresistable
year-round.”

Though the eating houses appear
to be promoting widespread sexual
superabundance, they do still advo-
cate practicing safe sex, as the
product's risqué name suggests. Be
warned, however, that this product
is not a contraceptive, and it in no
way serves as an alternative to
latex condoms.
