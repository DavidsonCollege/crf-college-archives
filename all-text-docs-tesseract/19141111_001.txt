Blythe Writes About
Alumni Association

Congratulates Team on Successful
Season and Appeals to the
Alumni for Support.

The Davidson Alumni Athletic Asso-

ciation, which was organized last Spring,
has done a tremendous work already for
Davidson athletics. They have put it
upon a new and firm basis and_ have
been instrumental in securing efficient
and capable coaches. The result has
been a splendid football season. and a
rejuvenation of the old Davidson spirit.
But the Association is facing a serions
situation in its plans for nexe year. “Phe
following letter from Mr. F. L. Blythe
(07), the enthusiastic and able Presi-
dent of the Alumni Association, is a
word of congratulation to. the Davidson
student body and team, and an earnest
appeal to-the alumni who. have been so
loyal to Davidson in the past:
"Ty the name of the host of loval
Davidson Alumni who are proud of the
_achievements of our college and its ath-
letic teams, | want to congratulate the
foor. ball. team, the coaches, the callege.
and the alumni themselves on the most
excellent team we have this vear. We
are proud of. the splendid — showing
against the University at Wrinston-
Salem on Saturday. We are proud ot
the season’s record so far. We are
proud of the fine spirit displayed by the
team and among the students. It is in
truth a revival of that old spirit, whole-
some and unconquerable, that so many
of us alumni remember so well and that
fills us with pride and enthusiasm as we
recount the achievements of our Alma
Mater.

“ “Te is remarkable that from a student
hody of three hundred and nineteen stu-
dents a foot ball team, every member of
which is a bond fide student and a gen-
tleman, can be chosen and trained to
meet, with such wonderful success, teams
representing institutions whose enroll-
ments range from four and five hundred
to nearly a thousand. The Red_ and
Black Machine played the strong Clem-
son team to a.o-0 score; Newberry was
defeated 23-7; Wofford received a
crushing defeat, 86-6; the formidable
team from the Citadel was beaten 16-0;
and all Carolina’s dope was upset by the
Red and Black’s holding the Vanderbilt
conquerors to a 16-3 score.

“Fellow Alumni, I call your attention
to this splendid record and to the re-
vival of a wholesome spirit of college
loyalty among the students. I want to

point you to the fact that these excellent |

conditions, prevail for two reasons: di-
rectly, because Davidson has in Mr. R.
A. Fetzer and his able assistant, Mr.
Nelson Harris, the best coaching staff
she ever had; indirectly, because the
Alumni are showing an active interest
in the college and the athletic teams,
and it is due largely to the Alumni that
these coaches are at Davidson. The
students realize and appreciate our in-
terest in them and are grateful to the
Alumni for these excellent. men as
coaches.

“The Alumni can derive the same
benefit and satisfaction from the success
of our teams as the students on the Hill.
and we are in better positions to pay the
coaches. So I want to ask you loyal
Alumni who are reading this to shell
out some of that Eurnpean War reserve
fund and help pay these men for their
services, which have been most valuable
to our teams, our college, and to vou.
War or no war, we must have three

Play South Carolina
Saturday in Columbia
“Gamecocks” Greatly Improved---

Former Stars Will be
Back in Game.

On Friday at noon the Varsity Squad
leaves tor Columbia, 8. C., to meet one
of their oldest rivals “Vine Gamecocks,”
ot the Cniversiry of South Carolina.
The South Carolinians, so reports say,
are laying for Davidsen. Durwg the
past few weeks “Red” Edgerton and
Costello have gotten their team together
and ahey are making all kinds ot boasts
that they will) overcome Davidson.
"Phey have at least four star players who
have been ineligible in games previous to
last Saturday. ‘Vhree of them are
“Speedy Plexico, who is fast as light-
ning on end. and “Duteii” Passileage,
who is a powerful plier: Johnson is
another. “Lliese players and one or two

Jothers they have been saving up for

Davidson. .

Last Saturday they deteated the strung’
Wake Forest team 20 too. “This shows
that they have an unusualiy strong team,
tor on the Saturday previous the “Bap+
tist’” had deteated the powerful Roa-
nok. College teant by the score at tg to
o. Roadoke had previously held VP. I.

to 7. and Washington and Lee beat
VP bonly. 7 006. Phe G,. of 5. C.

Jhas a strang team, and it will be a hard

fight to the finish, undoubtedly one of
the hardest of the entire season.

Past records of the two teants show
that Davidson has come out with fly-
mp colors in eight our of ten ganics.
The game’ Saturday will be. warched
with more interest. than probably any
lo be played in the South on that day.

Its net known at present: wheeher
McKinnon or Glore will accompany the
team er not, but hope has nor yer been
given up. ‘

‘The Columbia State says of lust Sat-
urday’s game: “The University eleven
showed 100 per cent improvement over
its last game in Columbia. In fact, one
would hardly recognize it as the same
team. Both on offense and on defense
the “Gamecocks” showed great) form.
Stoney, Heywood, Plaxico, Laugton and
MeMillan’: were the stars. Plaxico
scored two touchdowns, so did the re-
nowned Dan Heywood.”

The fact that the game will be on
South Carolina’s home grounds, where
they have a strong bunch of substitutes
and a good scrub team, gives Carolina
more advantage. Line-up:
