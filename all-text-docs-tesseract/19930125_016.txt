THE BACK PAGE INTERVIE W.

With President John Kuykendall

By Chris Frampton
Editor's Note: The Davidsonian
recently had a chance to talk with
President John Kuykendall about
various issues affecting the
Davidson College campus.

Davidsonian: One of your major
responsibilities as President has
been supervising the Campaignfor
Davidson. Can you give us anidea
of how the fund-raising effort is
progressing?

Kuykendall: We’re very encour-
aged and right now the campaign
does take a lot of time, not only for
me, but for a lot of people in this
community, and not only people
who are paid to raise money for
Davidson. Faculty and staff mem-
bers who have other major obliga-
tions, alumni and volunteers, -a
number of students as well - every-
body has joined the effort. The
campaign has good momentum just
now. The economic circumstances
under which we’ ve operated for a
year or so have been mildly ad-
verse at best, and yet the campaign
continues to meet its goals along
the way. People keep saying that
the last fifty million or forty mil-
lionis the hardest, and they’ re prob-
ably right about that, but we have
every reason to be optimistic from
this vantage that we’ll make the
campaign goal and make it on time.
We’re coming to the point in the
campaign at which you begin to
see which projects have been at-
tractive to donors and which ones
need more support. You may faise
the total number of dollars you
anticipated, but directing those
dollars to the particular goals is a
kind of juggling game.
Davidsonian: When you took on
the job, you must have certainly
had certain goals for the college.
Have you been succseful in attain-
ing those?

Kuykendall: The office is a lot
messier, a lot messier. I think that
the goals that I established for
myself in taking this job are essen-
tially attached to the goals the com-
munity sets for itself. This is a
community which is rather intro-
spective and always striving to
improve. If “excellent” is good
enough for today it is not good
enough for tomorrow. We try to
goon beyond ourselves. Thatholds
true in practically every area of life
in this college. I was commenting
to our first year faculty recently in
alittle session we had together that
they will learn that as spring time
comes, our energy and patience
always seems to run out at the
same time the semester does, and
there’s nothing left. If the semes-
ter lasted three more days we might
have meltdown. Then we regroup
and we come back the next year,
determined to be the best we can
be. That’s something that’s almost
instinctive in the Davidson com-
munity.

Soif] were to say I’ve metany
of my goals I guess I would have to
quickly comment that beyond that
another goal emerges beyond that
one, and I think that that’s true for
the community as well. I don’t
have any preconception of what
has to be accomplished at any given
time. Ihave personal chronologies
that I kind of live by, including my

age and my health and my enthusi- ,

asm about the job I’m doing. My
sense of call-
ing is essen-
tially the vo-
cation to the
teaching pro-
fession. I do
this as a kind
of an adjunct
to what I feel
called. to do
with my
whole life.
Davidsonian:
Have you
started to lose
the call?
Kuykendall:
Not the call to
teach, cer-
tainly.
Davidsonian:
Have you be-
gun to con-
sider retire-
ment?
Kuykendall:
Every morn-
ing. Seriously
though, I do
havearespon-
sibility to
think about an
appropriate
point of tran-
sition to some
other
president’s
leadership of
the college,
and when and
how that takes place, and there are
certain obvious parameters. If my
health and my relationships with
the constituencies hold] feel Ihave
an obligation to finish this cam-
paign, for example. Beyond that, I
think, if not selfish, at least self-
consciousconcernscome into play.
How long does one do a job like
this without becoming stale and,
from the college’s vantage, when
does an appropriate time come for
someone who has different strate-
gies and strengths than I do?
Davidsonian: Can you give us
idea on how you see the school at
this moment?

Kuykendall: I’m probably the
worst person to address that issue.
In the areas where strength is
needed I see strength. In terms of

the sort of people who are attracted

here as students, as faculty mem-
bers, as staff, I see the right sorts of
peoplecoming. I see always places
in which we need to work on our-
selves and be better, and some-

times change comes at a very slow
pace. We sometimes can judge
how well we’re doing not by how
different we are, how much bigger
or fancier or whatever, but how
well we’ ve adhered to the particu-
lar goals.that we’ve set for our-
selves, ~

My vision on this may be lim-
ited because I’m an avowed advo-
cate of Davidson as a liberal arts
college, and as a liberal arts col-

lege that is historically related to
the Presbyterian Church.
Davidsonian: How about the
school’ s relationship with DCPC,
how do you see student involve-
ment as well as the exchange be-
tween the church and the adminis-
tration?

Kuykendall: I think our relation-
ship with the local congregation is
so much better now that it is more
carefully delineated. We have a
very fine working relationship with
DCPC just now, institution to in-
stitution. I guess, what I see in
terms of student involvement is a
cyclical rélationship, in part. The
church’s clear intention with the
prospect of hiring a new associate
minister, is to become much more
involved in the life of the campus.
With thecollege’s intention tohave
a new chaplain who can provide
the same sort of leadership that

Chuck did, we’ll have a great,

team. So there should be a very
strong relationship and by all odds

anenhancementof studentinvolve-
ment in DCPC. But that’s crystal
ball gazing. We don’t know how
that actually works out, but with
regard to our ties with the congre-
gation here on the corner of the
campus there is every reason to be
optimistic.
Davidsonian: One of the most
prevalent issues on campus this
year has been the new alcohol
policy. To date, your opinion and
role has not
been gaged.
Could you give
us anideaof the
role youplayed
in the adoption
of the new
policy?
Kuykendall:
Itismyrespon-
sibility to re-
ceive the pro-
posal, review,
and approve it,
and then con-
vey it to the
board for their
confirmation.
In this case,
Will Terry, The
CCRL, and
others worked
on the new
policy. I was
kept apprised
of develop-
ments through-
out, and re-
viewed several
drafts before
the final form.
It’s my respon-
sibility, consti-
tutionally, to
present policies
that need
trustee ap-
proval to the
board.

i Lon
terms of the drafting of the policy
itself, my role was more consulta-
tive. Ifelt that some things that had
to be there from the standpoint of
the law, others from the college's
sense of both responsibility and
liability, and others that would be
very significant just from the over-
all stance of the college. So I was
involved, yes, and concurred with
the proposal that was taken to the
trustees. I felt it was the proper
thing to do.
Davidsonian: Do you think the
policy has been succesful?
Kuykendall: I think it’s too soon
to tell. I would be wary of any
answer anyone gave on that. I
think it’s certainly made a differ-
ence in some social patterns on the
campus. Ironically, it has perhaps
provided some encouragement for
precisely the sorts of things that
the people who were responsible
for the law to raise the drinking age
were concemed to prevent.
Davidsonian: The new policy has

often been criticized for taking
away much of the “freedom and
responsibility” that seems to be
the underlying priciple of the Code
of Responsibility. How do you
respond to that?

Kuykendall: Each individual still
has responsibility for his or her
own behavior but the college is
finally responsible for what goes
on‘within the community. I think
we share responsibility. I don’t
think either option is an adequate
answer. There is a sense in which
PCC governance had the opportu-
nity and relinquished it, but there’s
also a sense in which we continue
to have responsibilities and obli-
gations as citizens of a state. But,
I guess my concern is that this is an
area of the college’s life which,
because of the peculiarities of the
law under which we all must live,
the college is either obliged to stick
itsheadin the sand andallow things
to go as they had been going or
provide some sort of leadership.
Davidsonian: Several Months
ago a letter appeared in The
Davidsonian regarding the new
policy and the use of another —
student’ s college i.d. as false iden-
tification. The letter, written by a

’ former chair of the Honor Coun-

cil, called for an end to the Honor
Code. Do you think sucha move is
at all warranted?
Kuykendall: The writer isa friend
for whom I have a great deal of
respect, but I don’t happen to share
his opinion on this matter. The
decision was intended to provide
some definition of the length to
which the college and its particular
ethos can reach into the commu-
nity. We are increasingly con-
scious in this day and time of the
limitations on the college’s legal
authority than say during earlier
times.

At the same. time I think the
point he was underscoring in a
very forceful manner isan assump-
tion that the moral: principles of
Davidson students are not circum-
scribed by geography. What is
appropriate behavior in one’s life
in this community ought, we hope,
continue to be appropriate in every
other community of which that
person will be a part not only dur-
ing college years but also the rest
oftheirlives. As] look at Davidson
alumni from the most recent ones
to those from earlier days it is
generally true that their word is
their bond and that their personal
behavior and demeanor within the
community is honorable. SoI see
the point he’s trying to make. I’m
notaware of the details under which
the decision was made , but I think
he’s madea very valid point. In my
mind, though, it doesn’t imply the
Honor System is bankrupt and
ought to be done away with. We
continue to hope that Davidson
students will be consistent in their
values, wherever they are.
