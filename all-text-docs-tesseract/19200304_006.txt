Fraternity Reception Enjoyable
Affair.

Clear weather for a Junior Speak-
ing Fraternity Reception! Such a
thing had hardly been thought of for
some 17 years past, but last Satur-
day night proved that there is an
exception to every rule, The weath-
er man had substituted some of the
coldest weather of the winter for the
usual torrential downpour of the oc-
casion. ,

The reception was somewhat later
than usual in beginning, owing to
the basketball game with N. C. State
did not end until almost 10 o’clock.
The visitors returning from this con-
test were greeted by the blazing
fires and cheery comfort of the dif-
ferent halls and lost little time in be-
ginning the festivities of the even-
ing.

After a short time, during which
the guests of several fraternities en-
joyed themselves in their respective
halls, couples began to move back
and forth between the “Rows” and
the society halis. For a time the
various receiving lines were almost
overwhelmed by the steady stream
of visitors, who stopped only long
enough to exchange greetings with
their acquaintances, as well as to
make new ones, and to be served
with the refreshments that were
pressed upon them. Mr. Miles, our
“Y” secretary, was heard to remark
after completing the rounds, that if
all the punch he had received had
beén. “spiked,” he would not have
been able to make his way home.
His experience was typical of that
of all the other guests.

In such pleasant occupations the
evening soon passed. The hour of
midnight had arrived and the recep-
tion was at an end almost before
anyone realized how late it was.

LARGE NUMBER OF GIRLS
ON HILL FEB. 27, 28, AND 29

During the closing days of Feb-
ruary Davidson College was beseig-
ed by a troop of the prettiest and
most winsome girls of the South.
So complete was our surrender that
not even the usual cry of “Fire” was
heard. Even the speeches of the sil-
ver-tongued Juniors were not supe-
rior to quiet orations delivered be-
fore small audiences, under the in-
fluence of soft moonlight, which was
very unusual for a speaking, and
which aided in causing the strong
heart of many a youth to flutter

The guests on the campus were as

of being a great coach.
Coach Grey has already spent a
