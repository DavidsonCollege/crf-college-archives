Lesson In Contrast

The appointment to the Board of
Visitors of Terry Sanford, perhaps
North Carolina's greatest education
governor, and Dr. - James Dickson
Phillips. dean of the University of
North Carolina law school, brings to
mind one of the chief drawbacks of
Davidson’s present trustee system.

With the addition of Sanford and
Phillips, the Board of Visitors now has
more men noted for their contribu-
tions to education than does the Board
of Trustees. Dr. Sam Spencer, presi
dent of Mary Baldwin College, and Dr.
Frank Hall, professor at Wilmington
College. are the only trustees directly
concerned with education. The other
trustees are either businessmen or
men from professions other than edu-
cation.

Thirty-nine of the 51 trustees are
elected by various branches of the
Presbyterian Church. The Alumni As-
sociation picks the rest. The result of
this election process is that all but
a few are Davidson graduates. On the
other hand, only five men on the
Board of Visitors were graduated
from Davidson. ;

On the basis of these contrasts, it
would seem that the college would be
better off to give to the Board of
Visitors the functions of the trustees
and let the trustees become another
Wildcat Club. But because the mem-
bership of the Board of Visitors has
even less time to devote to Davidson
that do the trustees, such a move
would not be desirable. But notin
the contrast between the make-up 0
the Board of Visitors and the trustees
should indicate that changes need to
be made in the trustee system.

It is an unpleasant fact of life that
it is practically impossible for the
trustees to meet more often at the
college. This is a fact that must be
assumed to be largely unchangeable.
Another fact that will probably not
be changed is that. the trustees have
little communication among them-
selves or with the college between
semi-annual meetings. This means that
they have little chance to keep abreast
of the changes taking place around
the school. ;

Because Davidson has provided
most of the undergraduate experience
for the trustees, they are unlikely to
be intimately aware of the alternatives
to the Davidson system. The only
other experience that most of them
have had has been in seminary OT
graduate school where the problems
are not the same as the ones faced by
Davidson and the student here.

The fact that so few of the-trustees
are primarily concerned with educa:
tion means that they are not even
generally aware of the changes in that
profession. As much as THE DAVID-
SONIAN claims otherwise, very defin-
ite changes are being made in the
college’s situation. ;

Because of their limited experience

and knowledge, it is hard for the
trustees to comprehend the changes,
opportunities and problems facing the
school. They are more likely to be
affected by pressures from their pres-
bytery or from their local business-
men friends to maintain the old con
cepts of excellence for the school.
The problem of course is that the old
standards of excellence are often not
as valid in this changing world as are
more modern standards.

What Davidson needs to do is to
apply to its trustee selection some of
the same consideration used in making
up the Board of Visitors. It needs to
increase the number of educators
among the trustees. It needs to draw
upon men whose experience is not
limited to Davidson. The trustees
themselves ‘need to spend every’ pos-
sible effort to keep up with the
changes in the college.

While the Board of Trustees itself
is the only group with the authority to
make changes in its selection process.
presbyteries and alumni should put
more thought into the men that they
select under the present system. At
the same time, these groups with the
help of the President’s Office and the
Alumni Office should exert their con-
siderable influence upon the trustees
to reduce the percentage of trustees
elected by presbyteries, to give the
faculty a voice in the trustee selection
process, and to look outside the set
of Davidson alumni to find trustees
who are not so bound to local tradi-
tions.

No Wonder

Dare, the magazine with the motto
“Life Should be Led Like a Cavalry
Charge,” dashed into the field of race
relations this month to provide an
answer for the question about the
origin of black power.

In an article by a Miss Susan Brown
entitled ‘I Hate George Thackery,”
Dare makes the point that legitimate
gripes against an individual are some-
times stifled because the individual
belongs to a minority race.

But Miss Brown inadvertantly
sheds some light on the origins of
Black Power. In order to make her
main point more effective she tries to
show that she has no racial prejudice.
She belabors the point so much that
one gets the idea that she must even
consider herself some sort of martyr.

To prove her broadmindedness, she
writes, “When I was in college I be-
longed to a civil rights group and I
was even a very close friends of a guy
who got arrested at a sitin at Howard
Johnson’s.””

Is it any wonder that Negroes have

come to mistrust white liberals who

are content to prove their dedication
to the blacks by pointing to friends
who are civil rights workers?

Fruitless Delay

As the work of the Student Body
Constitution Revision Committee
drags along, it is beginning to ap-
pear that its effort is being wasted.

Although the student body has been
kept pretty much in the dark about
what the committee is discussing, it
can get some idea of what has been
done by referring to information that
was released by the committee last
spring. At that time the committee
was thinking in terms. of streamlining
the present system by reorganizing
the executive branch of the student
government to make it more efficient.

There was also some talk of reor-
ganizing the judiciary branch to pro-
vide the means for ruling on the con-
stitutionality of any future legislation.
A student bill of rights was also being
considered as a possible addition to
the constitution.

As far as the general student body
knows, the ideas proposed last spring
are still in the making. One thing dis-
cussed last spring as a possibility,
however, has obviously been changed.
That is the timetable for presenting
the revised constitution to the student
bodv. Originally the schedule called
for the presentation of at least a draft
by early fall. November finds us still
waiting for such a draft.

If the comm'ttee had decided to go
off on a different tack from the ideas
discussed last spring, the delay would
be understandable. Apparently, how-
ever, the delay is simply being caused
by constant haggling over details that
are to fit within the same old system.
A desire for perfection is admirable,
byt that desire will never justifv the
revision committee’s stalling until it
leads them to explore some basic. de-
parture from the ideas of last spring.

Then the idea of a bill of rights and
a constitutional court were essential-
lv just ic'ng on the present plain cake.
The revision of the executive only
amounted to making the old system

more effective by adding efficiency
by means of centralization and by cut-
ting away deadwood.

It failed to take note of the increas-
ing communication that has grown up
informally among all areas of campus
government, including the faculty, ad-
ministration and trustees. Instead it
maintained the fast becoming out-dat-
ed idea that the students govern them-
selves in some way that is segregated
from the rest of the campus.

If the revision committee is ever go-
ing to propose a new constitution to
the student body, then it should give
it one that recognizes the changing re-
alities and opportunities on the cam-
pus. Otherwise the committee’s hard
work will be wasted and the long wait
by the student body will have been
in vain.

No Holiday

While we wait for the new day that
is supposed to come out of the Blue
Sky for Davidson, one change should
be made soon to correct an injustice
done to language professors here.

While other departments at least
enjoy the theory of a sabbatical year
for professors, the German and
French departments do not benefit
from the idea.

The Junior Year Abroad, from
which many students profit greatly.
has become a real drawback to the
professors who accompany them on
this learning experience. Through
some bit of warped reasoning, that
year of advising about 15 students
in a strange land is considered to be
enough of a break for the professor to
compensate for the lack of a sabbati-
cal year.

Does anyone really think that run-
ning the foreign end of the Junior
Year Abroad for a year gives the pro-
fessor any time to increase his own
teaching skills or subject proficiency?

‘LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Man’s Transcendence Hit
As Part Of °17 Revolution

Dear Editor,

During the coming week,
there shall be observed in
several places throughout the
world ‘the first half-century
of the Soviet Union and of
The Revolution. Millions of
human beings will celebrate
this event, but it is not al-
together an unreasonable sup-
position that the ultimate
significance of November,
1917, will be lost.

The Revolution is neither
military nor political in na-
ture but is rather an inte-
lectual. ideological, and. in-
deed, pseudo-religious move-
ment.

It is an idea, and its goal
is conversion. It advances a
concept of man which is fun-
damentally opposed to that
basic to Western civilization.

it presents a being with in-
finite rather than finite ca-
pabilities, a being perfectibie,
if not perfect, in every attri-
bute, a being upon which
there are no limits imposed
by the nature of Its creation.

Within this century, per-
haps within a few short years,
poverty, disease, hatred and
fear will be banished, and
mankind will have reached
the Heaven on Earth, the
Utopia, the Great Society.

Man will determine for him-
self that which is Good.
Truth, Beauty, Justice, which
are held to be not transcen-
dental absolutes but cultural
institutions. Man is the ulti-
mate being, the measure of
all things.

Ged, indeed, is dead, end
man the Inheritor of His king-
dom. The imperfections in
man’s pest and present are
attributed te ignorance and
superstition and to the Instl-
tutions which they have en-
gendered and sustained.

These, which include relig-
ion, private property, the
family and government, to-
gether with those malevolents
who defend them, must be
eliminated as hindrances to
the apothesis of mankind.

Such is the significance of
The Revolution. It is a man-
ifestation of the eternal revolt
of tre arrogance of man
against the majesty of God.
now decked out. in- academic
robes, dignified by the sci-
entific appellation. presented
as economic theory.

Man in reality occupies no
such exalted place in the uni
verse, nor possesses such
high attributes. He is a crea:
ture. besieged with desire
and passion, hatred and lust.
He is imperfect, selfish and
miserably finite.

In short, he is human. Im-
piety and sacrilege notwith-
standing. any ideology which
would ignore. or any policy
which would correct this im
perfect finitude. threatens
Man’s humanity. This inhu-
man goal of revolution re.
quires, and has required, in-
human means.

You can’t make an omelet
without breaking eggs, nor
a revolution without breaking
heads. Man must not be “‘ex-
alted” to a being hereft of
all that is truly human, a
denizen fit only for a Brave
New World.

When The Revolution seems
so easily accepted and so
often emulated by those who
would lead Western civiliza-
tion, it becomes the duty of
any who would oppose and
hinder its : achievement to
publish their views and to
repudiate these leaders.

Yours in Counterrevolution.

Year Abroad Not
Just A Good Deal’

Dear Editor,

Three weeks ago, a column
appeared in THE DAVID.
SONIAN written by Heyward
Carter, describing why the
Junior Year Abroad Program
is one of the “‘best set of
deals” offered by the college.

The description was true,
as far as it went, but it was
misleading. Either his de-
scription is his real view of
the year, or one that he
thought would interest the
student body, or else I did
not understand some: of the
implications that he was try-
ing to make.

I agree. the year is all of
what he listed, but the im-
plications of the column left
it at the level of least import-
ance and least meaning.

If that description is one on
the level of least importance
and least meaning. what does
one on a higher level include?
My answer is that it includes

STUDENT POWER
Real Goal Is

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Since the Free Speech
Movement began at Berke-
ley three years ago, student
power has been one of the
most talked-about issues on
college campuses across the
nation. Two weeks ago the
issue again rose to the fore-
front as $0,000 students or
more invaded the nation’s
Capitol City for a protest
peace demonstration.

In a recent issue Newsweek
discussed the problems of
student power in 1967 and
quoted one senior at Mary
Washington College as say-
ing. “We want the right to
be wrong.”

At Davidson we would say
that students want the pow-
er to affect decisions which
Girectly affect them.

Davidson is not traditional-
ly known for its demonstra-
tions or protest marches.
Students have learned that
the quieter methods of change
are usually the most effec-
tive, at least at Davidson.

“A petition with 800 names
on it is not half as good as a
well-reasoned argument pre
sented by one student to an
administration member,”* one
Student Council member com
mented recently.

A careful examination re-
veals that student power and
influence are increasing rap-
idly on the Davidson campus.
Students now serve as voting
members on five faculty com-
mittees under the new fac
ulty constitution, and have an
influential voice on other
committees. Through the Stu.
dent Recruiting Program,
students have a‘ voice in the
Admissions Department.

Probably the biggest break-
through in this area was the
election last year of two stu
dents to the Blue Sky Com
mittee and several others to

various Blue Sky subcom-
mittees. According to facul-
ty members on the commit-
tee, their suggestions proved
very helpful in many deci-
sions. Even the trustees, who
allowed students to attend
their committee meetings for
the first time, were favorab-
ly impressed with student
ideas.

Students still lack the pow-
er to influence decisions in
many areas. Sadly enough.
however, many ‘of us even
enjoy playing the old game
of Student vs. Faculty.

The problem we are dis-
cussing is one of communi-
cation. As the walls that stood
between students and facul-
ty begin to crumble, the lines
of communication begin to
open up. This is happening
all too slowly though, for this
is a change which has been
long overdue.

The key to opening up these
lines of communication is a
little give-and-take on both
sides. Since the administra-
tion has previously held al-
most complete control over
student life, they will have to
relinquish some of their pow-
er to the students by allow-
ing more representation on
committees and more influ-
ence in decision-making and
by listening with attentive
ears when the Student Coun-
cil recommends a change.

The road is a two-way
street, however. To merit this
increase in contro! over their
own lives, the students’ re-
sponse must be a mature
one, Students who are on fac-
ulty committees must take a
responsible part in the com
mittee’s work and show in
terest in what is going on.
Others can alleviate their re-
sponsibilties by finding out
who these committee mem:
bers are and taking to them
the suggestions which usual-

all of that which Carter said
—with different implications
of meaning, and it includes an
academic side.

\

Yes, you can travel a great
deal, but this travel is for
people, museums, cities.
architecture, country side...
experiences. Yes, you can
take a weekend in Paris or
Madrid, or Munich or Berlin,
not to drink beer and discuss
your latest date, but for
concert, drama. important
friends. a deeper understand-
ing of both people and cities.
Yes, there is at least a girl-
boy ratio but here there is no
comparison with Davidson
social life.

Yes, you can have a light
work toad, if that is your de-
sire, but the opportunities are
among the greatest here in
areas where Davidson can
never compete. especially in
foreign languages and litera-
ture. And ‘that is what makes
the year worthwhile when it
is viewed as the junior year
of your college education
abroad.

But I see two ways in which
you are “screwed.” Davidson
does not push the student in
the language enough so that
much of the most fascinating
academic work can be begun
as soon as you arrive at the
university. And once there,
the student does not push
himself enough so that he can
take advantage of the aca-
demic, and educational, op-
portunities that are present
there:

The year should not be call-
ed a ‘‘good deal,"’ at least not
when related to the idea of a
liberal education. There it
can be most difficult, made
so by the things which con-
front you as an individual:
people, situations and values,
all critical of the life that you
probably have known up to
that time.

The dependence on yourself
may be a second of the best
aspects of the year. Once
there with your self, you have
the opportunities. Once back
at Davidson, you see where
you failed your self, but in
that. you may be better pre-
pared for the next opportuni-
ties.

Unsacred Cow Better Than Draft

One of the least sacred of all cows at Davidson
resides in the basement of Belk. There can be found
among students pro and con adherents to every ques:
tion or issue here whether it be athletics, fraternities,
the Blue Sky Committee, or even the drinking rules.
There is dissension, that is, concerning every issue but
one—the status of the Davidson ROTC department.

To knock ROTC is one of Davidson’s oldest and
dearest traditions—everyone does it and probably at
one time or another everyone has a good reason to,
especially the somewhat more than reluctant MS I and
Il Tuesday afternoon soldiers. But mention an occasion-
al good point or two about the program and it's gen-
erally decided you’ve been brainwashed by the base-
ment Gestapo or that you're naturally “gung-ho
ROTC,” either of which disqualifies you from being
capable of making any sane statements.

All of which obscures the fact that there actually
are some good points to the ROTC program, and both
of them are pretty substantial ones.

First is the fact that ROTC is simply the lesser of
two evils—the greater being the draft. Six semesters of
spit shines, rifle cleaning and sore feet once a week are
worth three draft-dodging free years of graduate school
to a lot of people. This may not be too important to a
great number of freshmen or even sophomores, but
Vietnam is a lot farther away from Cannon and East
than.it is from Little or Richardson. ;

A senior in ROTC at least knows definitely that he
will serve for two years and that in most cases he has
at least two or three years before he has to start, and
further, that he will be an officer when he finally gets
there. The juniors and seniors in advanced ROTC seem
to prefer this to an alternative of three years as an OCS
officer or, for those who play the draft and lose, two
years as a private.

To some of us the years of drill and brass polishing
and six weeks of eating dust at Fort Bragg just isn’t
worth the $50 a month it nets. But for others it's the
only reason for being in the program. ROTC is a big
business at Davidson and it’s a cash business.

Last month nearly $25,000 was sent from the De-
partment of the Army to the Davidson ROTC Depart-
ment for distribution among MS II] and IV students and
boys on ROTC scholarships. A monthly check to the
department averages around $15,000, and for the year
approximately $185,000 is paid to the 16 full scholar-
ship students and juniors and seniors in the program.
Some of us it helps—it helps a lot.

All of which sounds pretty much like a typical
ROTC pitch. It’s not. There are some extremely, to say
the least, questionable aspects of the program—the
first two required years, in particular—and, with many
of us, the draft program in general. But the
draft is fact and it may be a long time, if ever, before
it is altered or abolished; the two-year requirement is
also fact, although student will, if it is such, may help
to change that. The point is, everyone, no matter how
much he might bitch about the program, owes it to him-
self not to overlook the possibility that for him it may
be a way of making the best out of a bad deal.

Respect, Influence

ly never leave the dormitory
room or fraternity house.

If the proposed Student
Body Constitution is accept-
ed, there will be many more
positions open in student gov-
ernment than presently exist.
The responsibility rests with
each student to find the area
in which he is interestell and
offer his services.

Responsibility goes farther
than merely serving on com-
mittees, though: it extends
to the personal lives of all
students. Many students are
constantly clamoring for con-
trol over their drinking hab-
its, and many faculty mem-
bers are sympathetic to their
problem. Yet other faculty
members point out that stu-
dents who have shown no
more care for the college's

dormitories than Davidson
students have, do not de-
serve the drinking privi-
lege.

it or character in the per-
sons at Davidson which de-
fines the life of this com-
munity. . . . The spirit which
so often has seemed to me
present at Davidson goes be-
yond mere toleration for an-
other's views and affirms in-
stead a fundamental respect
for the persons who express
these views.”

Student power at Davidson
does not mean marches and
demonstrations. It means that
students want to become a
more influential part of the
community and ask the ad-
ministration to show more re-
spect for their views.
