Davidson’s newly formed
fencing team got off to a
tremendous start this week as
they rolled to an 85-54 3/4
victory over previously unbea-
ten Ball State.

Coach Sterling Martin's
squad combined explosive
speed with some quick ham-
mer work to dominate the
Buffalos. Several new records
were established including
Scott Harbottle’s time of
15:27 in the 220 picket fence
that smashed his previous
record of 16:03.

Harbottle displayed some
nifty hammer work in scoring

his victory. The potential All-
American from Walla Walla
felt that nail selection played a
crucial role in his record
performance,

“TI felt really confident com-
ing around the turn but had
some trouble with my cross-
bars down the straight. For-
tunately I had switched from
3/4 to 1 1/4 inch nails just
before the race or I would have
never won.”

In the always grueling 400
barbed wire competition,
‘““Easy’’ Ed Anderson contin-
ued Davidson's winning ways
with a time of 12:05. The race
was run with three strands
instead of the usual four

COACH MARTIN points out that
one must have ‘“‘grace as well as
force’ in mastering the more
complex fencing techniques.

strands used in international
competition.

After the race Anderson
complained bitterly about the
race conditions.

‘It's harder than hell to
pound posts into that damn
tartan track, otherwise I could
have broken eleven minutes.”’

Lance Dickey echoed And-
erson’s sentiments after a dis-
appointing third place finish in
the 880 split rail.

‘‘All I want to know is if
Cartmill has ever tried to sink
a 4x4 into that crap they call a
track.”’

However, Coach Martin was
not overly concerned with his
team's complaints. He feels
certain that the problem will
be cleared up by the end of the
year.

‘IT was reading Fencer’s
World Journal the other day
and I noticed that Williams
College has recently installed
an artificial Prairie Turf track.
The way I figure it, it’s only a
matter of time now til the
word gets to Sam and: we get
ours.”’

Not everyone was complain-
ing and Dave Keller was all
smiles after a devastating per-
formance in the two mile
electric fence competition.
Keller shocked the Buffalos
with a sly move on the back
straight that crossed the wires
‘of two Ball State fencers,
shorting out a late challenge
by his opponents.

In what many people con-
sidered the most exciting race
of the day, the Davidson one
mile chain link relay team was
narrowly defeated by the Ball
State squad. Coty Pinckney
had a comfortable two post
lead in the third leg when a 50
yard segment of chain link
suddenly snapped loose from

its post and rolled itself into a
“chain link Coty-dog’’. Coty
lost several precious minutes
cutting his way out but to no
avail as the Buffalos rolled to
victory.
_ Coach Martin is planning on
a very strong recruiting sea-
son with several top prospects
having already signed letters
of intent to Davidson.
‘We've got a couple of blue
chippers coming in from Okla-
homa who do incredible things
with barbed wire. We've also
got a kid from the Big Apple

who has more natural talent in
chain link than anyone I've
ever seen.”

Martin sees a bright future
for this relatively new sport of
fencing. However he thinks
training must start at a youn-
ger age.

‘If we can. get a few Pee
Wee leagues started—maybe
in something like chicken wire
than working up to goose and
cow wire—I don’t see any
reason why wecan't take on
the Reds in international
meets,”’
