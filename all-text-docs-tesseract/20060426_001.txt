Shepard speaks on
hate crimes, politics

By SARAH BALEY
Staff Writer

Judy Shepard discussed the hate
crime that resulted in the death of
her homosexual son, Matthew, in
her speech to the Davidson com-
munity on Monday.

Shepard spoke about Mathew’s
coming-out process, same-sex
marriage and the politics of
Wyoming, where Mathew was
murdered in 1998.

Shepard began her lecture with
an eight minute video that featured
the Mathew Shepard Foundation
and the James Byrd, Jr. Foundation
for Racial Healing.

Byrd, a middle-aged black man,
died after being chained to the back
of a pickup truck by three white
men and dragged down a road in
Texas in 1998.

“This isn’t a gay thing,” Shepard
said. “This is a hate thing.”

Immediately following the
video, Shepard read aloud from the
victim impact statement she pre-
pared in 1999 following her son’s
death.

“I love and miss Matt more than
I can express in this statement,”
Shepard said. “There aren’t enough
words to express how much I love
and miss him. He was my son. My
firstborn and more. My friend. My
confidant. I will never understand
why anyone would want to hurt
Matt, to act with such cruelty.”

The College Bow! team finished sixth in the national tourna-
ment held in Hartford last weekend. The team that competed
was clockwise from top left: J.C. Boyle ‘08, James Wells ‘06,
Jon Squires ‘06, Sims Hill ‘06 and Eric LaForest ‘06. Team mem-
bers who did not compete are Stewart Pierce-Gardner ‘08,

Philip Compeau ‘08 and Austin Mercadante ‘06.

Shepard explained that she and
her husband, Dennis, were living in
Saudi Arabia when they learned
that Mathew had been hospitalized
and that it had taken them.more
than 19 hours to return to the
United States.

She discussed her pain at being
unable to recognize Mathew
through all his injuries and the suf-
fering she felt for her younger son,
Logan, as he said goodbye to his
brother for the last time.

After reading her victim impact
statement, Shepard proposed a
series of questions to the audience
regarding hate crimes.

Without trying to offer a defini-
tive answer to these questions,
Shepard suggested that the root of
hate is ignorance.

She urged homosexual students
to come out to their friends and
families and promised that open-
ness leads to acceptance.

To demonstrate her point,
Shepard shared with the audience
her reaction to Mathew’s coming-
out.

Rather than loving her son less,
Shepard was relieved that Mathew
was finally free to be himself.

On the issue of same-sex mar-
riage, Shepard argued that mar-
riage is a federal issue.

She expressed frustration that
homosexual couples are denied the
