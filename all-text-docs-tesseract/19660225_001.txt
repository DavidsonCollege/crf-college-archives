Faculty Adopts All Proposals

Davidsonians Give Aid
To Underprivileged

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Davidson professors and stu-

dents are providing a sort of
“extension program” for under-
privileged and under-educated
children in the immediate area.

Project Opportunity, as the
program is called, is designed
to give select groups of under-
privileged children cultural and
educational opportunities which
they would not otherwise have.
It is supported by organizations
such as the Ford and Danforth
foundations.

According to Norman Johnson,
history instructor, who heads
Davidson's committee on Project
Opportunity, the program is still
in the experimental stage. In
this area recipients of the aid
are. about 150 students at Irwin
Avenue Junior High School in
Charlotte, an all-Negro school.

“Davidson undertook to do
anything they could to help. We
really haven't done much yet.
We're trying to resist the temp-
tation to do too much at once,”
Johnson explained.

Johnson gave H. Edmunds
White, director of admissions
and financial aid, credit for re-
ally getting Davidson embarked
on their part of the program.

“He really sold the adminis-
tration on it.’ said Johnson. ‘‘He
needled them and pushed them
until they agreed.” As a result,
a committee was set up to direct
and coordinate Davidson's ef-
forts.

Johnson went on to outline the
project's aims and methods and
how Davidson is helping. A
group of students who seem ca-
pable of faster progress is given
special instruction, both academ-
ically and otherwise.

The idea is to follow them
through their academic careers
all the way into college. ‘‘They
try to keep them together in
block classes,” he said. “They
try to see if instruction can be
pitched to a little higher level.”

A full time counselor, Chris
Sanford, is employed to direct
the program, ‘His main job is
just doing very simple things
they’d never do otherwise,”
Johnson explained.

Johnson envisions much ex-
panded participation, though.
“This summer we hope we'll be
able to do more for them. There
will be fairly short courses of
instruction, mostly in basic ar-
eas, but with some drama, art
and so on.

“One of the things Sanford
does,” he continued, ‘‘is to have
book discussion groups. I'm re-
ally amazed by the stuff they
read —like Candide, which we
just finished in Humanities. A
few Davidson students are going
to starf working in these. We're
trying to get the students in-
volved.”

One of the students who is now
participating is

manager for the Y camp.

Carroll said that the surplus
funds were due to two possible
factors, the first being that the
Y was not charged rent at Camp
Thunderbird—‘‘at least not yet.”

The camp, according to Car-
rol was well equipped with ex-
cellent recreational equipment
such as boats, canoes and a
“real fine swimming pool.”’ The
cabins also were in excellent
condition.

“It’s really amazing the in-

they read The Pearl, and they've

Fraternities To Launch
Food Purchasing Co-Op

By GREY PASH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The newly organized fraternity
food purchasing co-op will go in-
to operation at Davidson around
March 1.

The Davidson College Interfra-
ternity Co-operative Purchasing
Association will take over the
job of buying food for the 12
Patterson Court fraternities on a
three-month experimental basis,
according to Irvine Welling,
chairman of the Interfraternity
Treasurers Council.

Welling stated that the co-op-
erative ‘‘will launch a new ven-
ture in food purchasing which
has received wide acclaim —
from both fraternities and vend-
ors alike—at other fine institu-
tions around the state and na-
tion, such as N. C. State, Univer-
sity of Florida, Ohio State and
Auburn.”

The idea of a co-op at David-
son was begun early last fall by
Tom Covington, fraternity liai-
son officer Covington, along
with the newly-formed Inter-
fraternity Treasurers Council,
the fraternity housemothers and
the IFC, did research and laid
the foundation work for the co-
op during the first semester.

Surveys were made of current
food costs, the mechanics of a
co-op operation and of David-
son's particular situation. Also

Randy Mc-!a-trip was made to N.C. State

to meet officials and housemoth-
ers and study their program.

Covington described the nature
of a co-op in the following man-
ner: ‘The concept of a co-opera-
tive purchasing association for
fraternities has gained rather
widespread acclaim among fra-
ternity systems in recent years.

“The co-op principle utilizes
the combined purchasing power
of all fraternities and, by chan-
nelling all purchases through a
central office, affects volume
purchases of a single item, thus
reducing the unit cost.

‘The co-op will be incorporat-
ed and ‘owned’ by the fraterni-
ties themselves with continuity
established through representa-
tion (on a board of directors)
from the Business Office, Dean
of Students Office, Alumni and
fraternity housemothers.

“Any net profit realized at the
end of the fiscal year reverts
pro rata volume purchase to the
members."" added Covington.

A secretary will be hired by
the co-op to handle orders, food
purchasing and billing.

Several reasons have been giv-
en for formation of a co-op. es-
pecially at this time. Some of
these include: increasing food
costs, acute labor shortage in
fraternity kitchens, the possibil-
ity of continuing delayed rush,
savings inherent in volume pur-
chasing. and the possibility that

$750 EXCESS FUNDS

for the use of the camp, which
was an unexpected donation on
the part of the owner. However,
Carroll and Terry mailed the
owner a nominal fee of about
$185 just as a gift so that the Y
might possibly use the camp
again this year.

The other possible source of
the surplus funds came from the
management of the eating ar-
rangements, This year the Y
hired cooks and did its own buy-
ing.

Carroll said that the camp
was open to a larger number of
students than in the past .and
that up to a point it was cheaper
to feed a larger number of stu-
dents oh a per man basis. Also,
Slater Food Service at Davidson
purchased the surplus food from

the YMCA after the camp was
closed.

Carrol! could not be definite as
to how the Y would use the ex.
tra funds. “We will need money
to start next year’s camp any-
way.” he stated.

During the summer there are
many expenses which must be
met before, any money is re-
ecived from registration. There
are printing bills for the pam-
phlets which are prepared and
the cost of mimeographing the
letters to the freshmen.

If the funds were used for this
purpose, Carroll stated, then the
extra would just be put into the
general Y fund, since those ex-
penses have to be met by money
from the fund anyway.

the ‘'co-op philosophy’’ might
serve as a spring board for bet-
ter interfraternity-college rela-
tionships.

Basically the co-op will oper-
ate as follows: All of the frater-
nities will order their foodstuffs
through the co-op. (Vendors will
supply this volume of food to the
co-op at a discount. Announce-
ments of bids were sent out to
53 vendors on February 17, and
the vendor offering the largest
discount will be awarded the
contract for that category of

Council FavorsMerging
Chapel, Vespers Cuts

By RON SNOW
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Student Council discussed
the Vespers situation and finally
approved the combining of chap
el and Vespers cuts, at its meet-
ing Monday night.

Jim Timmons reported the re-
sults of a recent meeting of the
Religious Life Committee in
which Will Terry proposed the
abolition of Sunday night Ves-
pers, to be replaced by a relig-
ious service every other Thurs-

Only Minor Alterations

Are Effected In Report

‘The faculty adopted Tuesday essentially the recommendations of the Social. Life
Evaluation Committee, including 100 per cent affiliation second semester rush and

Minor changes were made in ternities, Clubs and Social Life handle or prevent the unpleas-

and plans for implementing af-
filiation opportunity.
CLARIFICATION

All ‘changes involved only
slight rewording to clarify the
intentions of. the committee and
the faculty.

The recommendation on the
Union cafeteria previously called
for a student-faculty committee
to insure superior food. The
altered form recommends that
a student-faculty committee
work with the administration to

insure a high quality level of °

food.

The proposal dealing with
freshman upperclassman contact
recommended that contact dur-
ing first semester be unrestrict-
ed Monday through Friday. with
a number of exceptions dealing
with contact in dormitories and
fraternity houses after 7:30 p.m.

In its original form. the pro-
posal dealing with affiliation re-
quired the IFC to submit to the
Faculty Committee on Frater-
nities, Clubs. and Social Life by

plan. according to guidelines
made clear in advance by said
committee, whereby every fresh-
man so desiring be given oppor-
tunity for affiliation with a fra-
ternity.

Dr. W. G. Workman, chairman
of the Social Life Evaluation
Committee. emphasized that this
rule allows a range of degrees
of classes of association be-
tween the freshman and the fra-
ternity.

‘CREATIVE WORK’

“The plan which is finally
adopted may call only. for op-
portunity for social affiliation or
it may call for opportunity to be
pledges,”’ said Workman. ‘*There
is opportunity here for crea-
tive work by the IFC and the
Committee."’

is trying to be as flexible as pos-
sible regarding the problem,”

said Dr. Louise Nelson. “It is

In addition, enough chapel cuts

who wished to. abstain from com-

eral disapproval from Council
members.

“It seems to me a little arti-
ficial to have a religious service

such service.is much better on
a Sunday in church,"’ said Dave
Powell.

GUIDELINES

This first part of the proposal
now states in its adopted form
that the IFC should submit to
the Faculty Committee on Fra-

Combining the cuts would al-
iow a person to cut all the re-
quired worship services, though
he would have to attend more
chapels if he did so. The re-
duced number of Vespers would
hopefully insure better speakers.
The motion carried, 11-3.

Council informed the mem-
bers that the Honor Court was
pressing for establishment of a
Student Body Regulations Court
which would have jurisdiction
over the trying of cases con-
cerned with violations of the Stu-
dent Body regulations, leaving
the Honor Court with the respon-
sibility for Honor Code viola-
tions only.

Council suggested appointing
instead of electing juniors and
seniors to such a court.

Most of the gripes were di-
rected toward the entertainment
provided by the Social Council—
the Ramsey Lewis Trio, comedi-
an Dick Davy and rock ‘n roll
star Lloyd Price—which, in stu-
dent opinion, was neither ade-
quate nor very entertaining.

“It was embarrassing for me
to bring a girl down here and
subject her to the type of enter-
tainment that was provided,”
said freshman Cader Howard.

‘Jim Marrow.

“I would think that with $30,-
000 the Social Council could do
a lot better,"" Bob Peel added.

In general, the students, with
a few exceptions, found the
Ramsey Lewis Trio more than
acceptable. However, nearly ev-
eryone agreed that Davy was
poor, if not terrible. And most
passed up Price's performance
in favor of fraternity parties.

“I thought Ramsey Lewis was
the best concert I've ever
heard,”’ said sophomore Vance
Hughes. ‘‘He was fantastic!”

COOPERATION

Dr. Nelson described the at-
titude of the faculty as being
one of “Let’s Cooperate."

“They (the faculty) all seem-
ed to be in pretty good agree-
ment,"’ commented Fred Sack-
ett, assistant to the president.
“and the recommendations were
voted on .as a group and ac:
cepted.”

The Social Life Evaluation
Committee has completed its
first task of presenting a report
on rush, but it has yet to fulfil!
its second charge of producing
an evaluation of the present
role of the fraternities on. cam-
pus and of what the role of the
fraternities should be.

“The Committee feels encour-
aged as it now seeks to dis-
charge its second duty,” said
Workman, ‘‘but we are not able
at this time to predict when we
will have this evaluation ready.”

Students Level Gripes
Against Social Council

Social Council Chairman Dan
Campbell. admitted that the
weekend was ‘‘under par, but I
don't think the Council owes an
apology as such. We're not go-
ing to pot; it was a combina-
tion of bad luck and bad leads."

“I don’t think that most stu-
dents have any idea of how ex-
pensive big attractions are,’’ he
said. ‘Some entertainers, such
as the Supremes. the Righteous
Brothers and’ Bob Dylan, de-
mand $5,000 or more, for just
one appearance.”

Campbell said that Price was
‘not our first choice. We were
victim of some bad luck in book-
ing, and Price was simply the
best we had left to choose from.”

DICK DAVY

As for Davy, Campbell noted
that the Social Council ‘got the
same type of recommendation
as we got on Fred Smoot sev-
eral years ago.”’ According to a
noted artist's agent, Davy is des-
tined to be a big star.

Faculty Hands Out
Hazing Penalties

Two fraternities were hand-
ed stlff penalties this week by
the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee for hazing infractions
which occurred earlier this
month.

Phi Delta Theta and Kappa
Sigma fraternities were placed
on probation by the college un-
til June, 1969. If any hazing
occurs within either chapter,
that fraternity will lose its
rushing privileges for a period
to be decided by the faculty.

in addition, eight members
of Phi Delta Theta and one
member of Kappa Sigma have
been deprived of house privi-
leges through March 27—the
begining of spring holidays.

The nine students will be un-
able to use their fraternity
houses for eating, studying,
recreation or any social activi-
tles until that time, according
to the committee’s decision.

We feel that this may not
be the fraternities’ fault en-
tirely, although they do have a
responsibility In this area,’
remarked a member of the
committee to THE DAVID-
SONIAN today.

“But this should be a warn-
ing to alt fraternities,’’ he con-
finued, “so that this type of
thing won't happen again.”
