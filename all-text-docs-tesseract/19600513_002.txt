ROTC

Good Enough To Be Better

Department

Davidson’s ROTC |
in newspaper jargon, is “good copy.
It's often in the news.

In April Georgia's Professor of
Military Science and Tactics called
Davidson’s military unit “the most
outstanding I've ever seen.”

And recently, significant changes
in the ROTC curriculum here have
won approving comment from observ-

ers at Davidson and elsewhere.

The ROTC Department, it seems,
is geared for success. Davidson’s
student soldiers are growing accust-
omed to being dubbed the best of the
lot.

The DAVIDSONIAN shares the
pride and interest of the campus com-
munity every time we hear the depart-
ment described as better than the rest.

And so we too were surprised at
the negative appraisal from a group
' of seniors questioned on the educa-
tional value of ROTC last week. One
senior asserted that “ROTC has about
the same educational value as sleep-
ing; it seems like a certain amount of
time spent in oblivion.”

In the business of education —
even military education — it seems,
being better than most is not good
enough.

The DAVIDSONIAN, prompted by
some suggestions from the seniors and
observations of our own, offers the fol-
lowing suggestions which we feel will
complement and enhance recent im-
provements in the ROTC curriculum:

1. Mere imaginative classroom
teaching. The usual ROTC class is
a rehash of material digested from
incredibly dull Army manuals. Oc-
casionally Army training films replace
the lecture.

‘The classroom period could be
made more challenging by a more
original approach to learning. Term
papers, parallel reading and student
debates on topics of current national
interest.

In the past such independent stu-
dent work has been used sparingly,
but to advantage. Why not supple-
‘ment soporific field-manual fare with
really nourishing learning right in the

ROTC classroom?

2. A more realistic and objective
view of world affairs. The present
ROTC philosophy might be summariz-
ed: “Americans are good guys. Rus-
sians are bad guys. World War Il
is just around the corner.” The re-
sult: indoctrination and some misin-
formation, not education.

The present ROTC curriculum is
training for war — not for cold-war.
Yet the most informed world com-
mentators observe that as long as
Russia (the bad guys) can win the
economic battle for the uncommitted
nations, she will be content to fight
without arms.

What has the department .to lose
by sponsoring objective study of the
cold-war, with an eye to training in-
formed officers who can be effective
in a peacetime army?

3. A more flexible exemptions
policy. We urge the ROTC depart-
ment to consider exempting from
compulsory training those freshmen
who are unable to pass the standard
Army physical examination for ad-
mission to the Advanced’ ROTC pro-
gram.

And we recommend exemption for
students whose parents request ex-
emption — regardless of their church
affiliation or other reasons.

The result would be smaller, more
interested classes — an advantage in
any course.

In an interview a few weeks ago
Colonel Adams stated that he “saw
no conflict” between ROTC training
and the ideals of liberal education.

We believe that implementing our
suggestions next year would enable
him to speak mofe positively — to
say that Davidson’s ROTC training ac-
tually enhances the value of liberal
education.

That may scund impossibly idea}-
istic, but we think improvement is
possible and well-worth the effort.

Military training at Davidson
should not be “a certain amount of

time spent in oblivion” — and it need.

not be. (ESD)

A Plea For Maturity

The Student Council’s decision to

give Jim Bootle a free rein with the
Court of Control is a disappoiritment.
We don't question Bootle’s sincerity
where the court is concerned, but we
will quarre] with his judgment.

Bootle said this morning that his
chief reason for putting the court
Wack into Friday chapel (after the
council had taken it out) is that the
Friday call-down will stimulate upper-
class interest and support in the pro-
gram of the Court of Control. With-
out this support, the court will be in-
effective. Bootle plans to make a
plea for dignity (and silence) during
‘the call-downs. He aims to assure
that all reports of regulation viola-
tions are legitimate, so that when a
boy is called, without benefit.of a
trial, he will be sure of being guilty
anyway. These are fine ideas, but
they just won’t work.

A chapel audience that reads news-
papers while the college president is
speaking won’t keep a respectful sil-
ence while a freshman accused of
cockiness stumbles to the front of the
auditorium. A congregation that can
make a double entendre out of the
word of the Lord will jeer an offender
with consummate skill. If the Court
of Control must Jook to jeers and cat-
calls for its support and authority, it
has little justification for existence.

The great injustice of the Court's
chapel procedure is that the accused
is punished before he has had a
chance to defend himself in a fair
trial. Bootle argues that it doesn't
matter if a boy hasn’t been tried be-
fore chapel, because everyone who is
called down is sure to be guilty any-
way. If this is the case, why bother
with a trial? It amounts to a kangaroo
court.

We heartily support the petitioned
amendment to the Student Council
constitution which would establish a
Freshman Advisory Board and abol-
ish the Court of Control. One pro-
vision of this amendment states: “It
shall be the primary duty of the Ad-
visory Board to give mature counsel
to any freshman who requests it, and
to take initiative in providing counsel-
ing for all freshman on an informal
basis.”

Once, very long ago, it might have
been the purpose of the Court of Con-
trol to give mature counsel. But it
has not counseled, and it cannot un-
der its present structure and philoso-
phy. Instead of alleviating freshman
adjustment problems, it complicates
them.

The freshman should be regulated
by a mature, constructive group, not
a mild version of the Gestapo. We

encourage you to vote for maturity

next Friday.

Dear Editor;

During the past week, some
of us were jolted by the rather
decisive faculty vote putting in-
to effect the much-discussed and
controversial Sophomore Rush.

That this is now @ fact no
one can deny, for the vote
and subsequent comments
tended to lend anything but

The first thing that comes
to my mind is that of the
Fraternity Housing Fee. We
are told by the business of-
fice thet it is imperative that
the college be paid $46.00 per
Fraternity man per year, in
order that the college realize

hope for @ reversal on the ' @ reasonable return on its in-

part of the faculty.
While not denying that there
would be certain healthy aspects

Considering that, say, two

percent, or around $11.50, mak-

B.H. FOR B.D.

Students, Flushed With Anger,

Solicit Aid For New Movement

. By LOY McKEITHEN and HENRY KEITER ae

It being generally known and unanimously accepted that this fair institution
is lacking in every conceivable respect. and there having occurred numerous and
varied campaigns, attacks, and wars to transform this odious situation of intoler-
able want, we of the Head Committee do hereby state clearly and in shocking real-
ity the most diabolically neglected area o Davidson College life and work.

In short, we demand Better
Heads for a Better Davidson.
As the response to today’s poll
was overwhelming. T H E
DAVIDSONIAN has gladly giv-
en us this space. This is not
surprising in view of this pap-
er’s enthusiasm for printing any
type of criticism.

Let us begin at that Hades of
Sanitation, Richardson Stadium.
Have you never reaiized that
the hundreds of people from
whom we are continually try-

ing to extract funds are here -

exposed to a spectacle of gross
dirtiness, cracked porcelain, and
odors.

What is more is that these
rich generous people and the
guests whom we are trying to
impress are faced with the
panicky horror of having no
toilet paper.

EMBARRASSMENT

In Chambers Bullding people
come barging through the door,
smashing knees, and falling
over a helpless person before
they realize the toilet is occu-
pied. The paper towels are
very logically placed beside
the urinal, where one has to
tolerate hands reaching over his
shoulder.

The library is a spectacle of
embarrassment. One is stand-
ing at the urinal when sud-
denly the door is thrust open,
and he is-exposed to the world,
which. often includes embarras-
sed. ladies. But this is not
much worse than before, as the
glass in the door is quite trans-
parent anyway.

None of the heads have doors

for the toilet compartments, this|

in «wl buildings see for your-
selves how. well painted, clean.
and odor free the faculty heads
are kept. We demand immed-
iate and total integration of
heads! In the best interest of
Davidson College!

MORE FACILITIES!

We demand bigger heads in
Cannon, East, and Watts, so
that when sophomore rush be-
gins, freshmen will have a place
to have social functions and
parties. Also they will serve
as meeting places for the new
25-man advisory board.

We demand more facilities,

¢specially -in Chambers where
there is only one toilet and
one urinal per head. This will
be in keeping with a more lib-
eral cut policy which will af-
ford more time for students to
use the increased facilities.

We make this final plea —
join with us for better heads by
1962. We are sure that Dr.
French's rabid interest in clean-
ing things up wil! lead to his
complete support. Also, as this
is another liberal cause, it goes
without saying that Dr. Goody-
koontz will render his influence
on our behalf.

faculty seems to be a taking
over where the fraternities
would not. What good are the
fraternities, aside from their
own selfish pursuits? What do
they do outside themselves?

SAE Fraternity has had a
series of speakers from time
to time, to which the entire
campus wes invited. ATO
Fraternity instituted the
“Olympics.”

The IFC has undertaken to
turn Hell Week into the more
constructive Greek Week, and
with noticeable results. Sup-
port of all. campus activities
is encouraged with especial em-
phasis put upon academic ef-
fort.

Campus clubs and honor-
series, Mate Chorus and Band,
the YMCA and Westminster
Fellowship as well as MYVF
and other activities of a re
ligious, social end academic
nature find support from men
who also find time to enjoy
fraternity life.

We will abide by the faculty
decision and will endeavor to

make Sophomore Rush work-
able. Changes were coming, for
the better, I believe. I just
hope that this one will be better
thought out, and time given

_ where it is needed.

Dear Editor,

First I want to clarify what I
have meant by the phrase “bring
glory to God through Jesus
Christ.”

When | first decided to use
this phrese (and numerous
people have told me that this
is antiquated) | wanted some-
thing thet would stick in the
mind of the student body as
the purpose of the YMCA for
next year.

By this phrase I meant that
every phase of YMCA work
would first be judged as to the
effect of this work. ‘Would it
be done to make the YMCA a
more popular organization, or
would it be done in line with
what is felt to be the purpose
of the YMCA?

This, then, is what | meant
when | used this cliche, 1
shall attempt to hold my use
of antiquated phrases to a
minimum. When | slip up,
I shall be glad to explain my-
self, .
Second, it has been brought

to my attention that the state-
ment on the recent Interest Card
was both contradictory and de-
rogatory in its connotation.

This statement read: “To
work or participate in the
program of the YMCA does
not mean that you must be-
lieve that Jesus Christ is the
Divine Son of God. But it
does mean that you must
recognize the above motivat-
ing purpose of the YMCA.”

The reason that this statement

was placed on the card was to
emphasize that to participate in
the YMCA one does not have
to make any statement of his
belief in any creed.

The statement was not meant
to derogate any person.or any
certain belief. In the future
this statement will be correct-
ed.

Due to the word limit for

letters to the editor, | have

hed to omit over half of my

letter dealing with member. .

ship, purpose and the Wild-

cat Handbook.

I plan to have this letter mi-
meographed in its entirety for
student reference. I invite you
to get a copy at the Union desk.

Dear Editor:

Professor French closed his
article in last week’s guest col-
umn of THE DAVIDSONIAN
with this statement:

“An official representative
of the college states that the
percentage of alumni on the
Davidson feculty is on the
decrease!

Any nonelumnus staff
member, | believe, would
consult the records, determine
the facts, give a slight shiv-
er, and come up with a some
what different snswer.”

I do not wish to debate the
issue that an alumnus cannot
be relied on to present a fair-
case, for if this is what Mr.
French believes, he is entitled
to his opinion. I do wish to
present the facts so that anyone |
who wishes may make a decision
as to the accuracy of the sta-
tistics in question.

The “official representative
of the college” was using fig-
ures prepared by me for use in
a talk before a group of alumni.
I therefore wish to take full re-
sponsibility for the alleged dis-
tortion of the truth.

My fects were collected
from the college catalogue
except in 1932, ‘34, ‘36, “56.
in these years the college en
nual was used.

I included all teaching mem-
bers of the faculty except mem-
bers of the ROTC Department.
These men are not selected by
the College Administration. No
one was included except teach-
ing members of the faculty.

My statistics have been check-
ed by Mr. French and are in
accord with his except for
slight variations due to the fact
that he excluded instructors and
visiting professors.

In no cases were our re-
sults in variance by more then
2% and in most cases agreed
exactly. in 1959 he had 40%.
The comparison extended on-

ly over the 1954-60 period.

Dillard Answers Bootle’s Chapel Charges

(Editor’s Note: Dave Dillard is the author of the proposed

amendment concerning the Freshman Adviso:

Board. He wishes

Henry Shue's proposal in the recent campaign. It pro-

vides for “. .. an Advisory Board to give

re counsel

to clarify several misconceptions which might derive from this

morning's chapel.)
By DAVE DILLARD

This polemic, addressed particularly to Judge James
Bootle, Esq., I should commence with “Poor Bootle! Fran-
tic Bootle! Vulgar Bootle! Noodle Bootle!” But that would-
n’t be nice and we must be nice in public, mustn’t we
Bootle.

Bootle, the fish are running downstream but rather
than try to stop them you might try to answer Professor
Abernathy’s question, “Which bottle are you in?”

WEAPON WAS COOLNESS
___ Bootle, you were magnificent in Chapel this morn-
ing, you appealed with great success to immaturity, mis-
understanding and red-necked prepschoolishness. Your
weapon was cool vulgarity.

Bootle, you were not far from the truth when you
alluded to a petition “signed by seventy-odd members
of the student body.” The men who signed that petition
were odd.

_ {They included the editors of all three campus pub-
lications, two members of the newly-elected Nonor Court,
former members of the Court of Control, several mem-

rary where one must greet all
who enter.

IN THE BEST INTEREST

But enough of particulars. We
have overall demands for all
the heads of Davidson. The
first of these is against dis-
crimination between faculty and
student heads. In Chambers
faculty heads have locks on the
doors and the water fountains
work,

The proposed amendment is almost identical to

to any freshman who requests it, and to take the initiative
in providing counsel for all freshmen on an informal
asis.””

Bootle, the whole implication of this statement in
that any counseling that is done will be from one mem-
ber of the Advisory Board to a freshman and that coun-
seling in front of a formal group is impractical.

The only time a freshman would be brought before
the Board as a group would be, as the amendment States,
when he has been reported for a violation of freshman -
regulations set up by the Board.

Furth No AN ADDITION

; rthermore, Bootle, the proposed Advisory Board
is anything but an “addition” to the counseling services
already set up for the freshmen. It would consist of the
twenty orientation group leaders who are already an in-
tegral part of the whole process of orientation.

These men are carefully selected by the Freshman
Advisor who works in consuitation with the Dean of Stu-
dents. It is not unlikely, Bootle, that you could and
would serve as a group leader.

You held this position last fall and, just think, under
the Advisory Board system you could still work to “re-
move any cockiness brought from high school,” that
cockiness which “is dangerous to the individual since
others will recognize it.”
