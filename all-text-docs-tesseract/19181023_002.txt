IN MEMORIAM.

On the sth of October, on the avia-
tion field at Fort Worth, Tex., Lieut.
Frank H. Smith, '16, was killed in an
aeroplane accident. Graduating at the
age of eighteen, Frank Smith was one
of the finest and smartest men that has
attended Davidson College. Dignified
of appearance, sterling of character, bril-
liant intellect, generous of heart, a
splendid orator, a popular, all-round
man—those who knew him in col-
lege remember him, and with the deepest
of respect. There was many an excla-
mation of heartfelt regret that such a
splendid life should be snuffed out just
as its time of usefulness to the world
had arrived.

When the influenza and pneumonia
epidemic had swept over the campus it
left behind it one sad spot in the college
life—the death of Daniel Currie. He
was bright and cheerful, and already
well liked in his short stay of not much
over two weeks on the campus. It is
hard to understand why a young life
with such a brilliant future should be
so pitifully cut off, and yet the ways of
Providence are guided by more than hu-
man wisdom. The deepest sympathy of
the entire student body goes out to his
home folks in their great trial.

Lacking just one day of completing
her training course in the Presbyterian
Hospital in Charlotte, Miss Rose
Stevenson, of Loray, succumbed to pneu-
monia contracted while bravely nursing
men back to health and strength here on
the campus. Davidson men appreciate
this noble sacrifice more than they can
express. Miss Stevenson’s brother, R.
M. Stevenson, was a graduate of Da-
vidson, and this fact no doubt drew the
trained nurse to come here to help.

A telegram received Sunday from the
Hampden Roads Naval Training Sta-
tion stated that J. S. Bachman, '18, died
on last Thursday night of pneumonia,
after a single day’s illness. Up to the
time when the paper went to the press
no further particulars had arrived. The
news came as a distinct shock to those
who knew him while in college, and his
classmates will hear of Joe’s death with
sorrow. Quiet and unassuming, Joe

———— TEE.

was popular with all, his position on the
Student Council attesting to his high
type of character. We all feel his loss
deeply.

EXPLANATION,

The fact that no Davidsonian was
published last week and that every issue
so far has been only four pages is due to
the influenza epidemic which continually
kept the staff and reporters’ staff short-
handed and confined everyone strictly to
the campus. We hope our readers un-
derstand the situation. From now on,
however, we hope to put out a live, full
sheet and make up for the deficiencies of
the last three weeks.

WANTED—CARTOONS,

To make The Davidsonian what it
should be, there should be more car-
toons or caricatures dealing with the
everyday life on the campus. Nothing
gives life and color to a paper more than
cuts of such a nature. There should
surely be a number of artists among so
large a gathering of young fellows, and
the staff would be greatly indebted to
any who would turn their talent in this
direction and draw for The Davidsonian
cartoons dealing with any phase of life
on the campus—athletics, drill, barrack
life, etc. Help us make the paper an
interesting organ.

THE LIBRARY.

There seems to be a misunderstanding
among many of the new men as to what
the Library is for. Some as yet are not
sure whether they can go into the read-
ing room or not, and have no idea what
the second floor is used for. Men, the
reading room is open to all. The news-
papers and periodicals were placed there
for you to read. You are urged to take
books out to read for instruction and
recreation. Miss Shaw will gladly fur-
nish any information as to reading mat-
ter which you may want. Use the Li-
brary freely and you won't regret it.

COMPANY RIVALRY.

Anything that stimulates rivalry in
work or play is of inestimable value in
arousing interest and purpose in the con-
testants. Company basketball has taken
the place of class ball this year, and it
should not only furnish recreation, but
should arouse a company spirit which
cannot help but extend into the regular
activities of the day, such as drill and
the maintenance of the general standard
of each company. It remains to be seen
which will prove to be the best all-
round company, but the sooner a com-
pany spirit or rivalry is formed, the
sooner will the general efficiency of all
the companies increase. Every company
has material for a good basketball team
and there should be a close and interest-
ing series. And may the best and best-
backed team win out.

NOTICE.

All men, especially the new men, who
wish to report for The Davidsonian are
requested to hand in their names to G.
A. Byrd, on first floor of Georgia, be-
fore Saturday night. No talent or ex-
perience is necessary, only a willingness
to work. <A competition will be held
during the fall for election to the re-
porters’ staff in the spring.

“Subscribe for a bond and allot five
dollars” has for the past week been the
slogan given by Lieut. Candler, and has
brought its results. The bonds  sub-
scribed by the students have aggregated
$13,050. Lieut. Candler addressed the
S. A. T. C. men on this matter and
brought out reasons for every soldier
here getting a bond at this time. The
fellows have practically to a man sub-
scribed, and furthermore will willingly
give themselves and everything else
when the proper time comes to “drive a
tack in the Kaiser's coffin.”

MISS ROSE STEVENSON.

Miss Rose Stevenson, who is remem-
bered by a number of men at Davidson,
died Monday, October 14, with pneu-
monia. She came from Charlotte when
volunteers were called for to treat the
influenza patients. Miss Stevenson was
an excellent nurse, and worked diligent-
ly in her unselfish endeavor to bring re-
lief to her patients. She was regarded
with the greatest respect and highest es-
teem by all who knew her, and it was
deeply regretted when she contracted
the illness that she was treating, necessi-
tating her return to Charlotte. Shortly
after her return she contracted a‘ case of
pneumonia, which proved fatal.

Miss Stevenson had just finished her
training at the Presbyterian Hospital,
and was at the point of graduation when
death robbed her of the honor. She will
be long remembered by those who knew
her at Davidson. Her service will be
remembered and appreciated, and the
honor will be bestowed upon her that
she deserved.

In behalf of the staff officers of the
local S. A. T. C., 1 wish to express our
deepest appreciation for the splendid
services rendered by all those who took
part in combating the recent epidemic
