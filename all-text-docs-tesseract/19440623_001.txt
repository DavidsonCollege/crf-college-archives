such courses
They
also receive a great deal of physical
and military training. Discipline
is taught in drill and in class and
meal formations, and the boys are
rapidly shaping up as good soldiers.

When called to active duty, after
three to nine*months training here,
tlfe ACER's will first be given the
basic

military training customary,

and,.in the same period of time,

a series of aptitude tests which will

determine the type of combat
crew training for which they
are best qualified. With refer-

ence to the training of*the ACER’s,
after they are called to active duty,
“Lt. Fruchter, public relations of-
ficer for the army at Davidson said:
“Each trainee will be given a course
of

military training before being: as-

five weeks+or longer in basic

signed to air combat crew training:

Those selected to earn aerial gun-
ner’s wings will receive at least six
weeks training in ‘aerial gunnery.
If the trainee is selected to combine
his gunnery with radio or airplane
mechanic skill, he is given an ad-
ditional five-month course in radio
or airplane mechanics. Armorer
gunners take an” additional two-
month course in armament. Pros-
pective bombardiers and navigators
take the aerial gunnery course be-
