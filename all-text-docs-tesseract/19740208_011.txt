Tournament Activity

Highlichts IMAC

League A tourney has
rolled — the double
elimination bracket now as
there are eight teams left to
battle it out for the B-Ball
crown.

In some of the more exciting

action the un-
defeated Cleveland Indians
gained a semi-berth by just
tipping the tenacious fresh-
man-infested Brew team 65-62
in double overtime.

Vergil Demery and Mark
Rodgeman led the hard-to-
predict Indians with 22 and 21
points respectively.

The Little Big Men com-
bined a superb fast break with
a sticky man to man defense
(Martin Eakes holding, IMAC
leading scorer Pat (Goon)
Flanigan to 19 points) to
defeat the otherwise hapless
ATO’s 59-41.

In an _ unfortunate intra-
fraternity struggle PDT #1
and PDT #2 confronted each
other to get into the semis.
Mitch Purvis, Dan Henderson
and George (Quasar) Weicker
led the No. 1 team to a fairly

preertrmce te point win over
their .

The fact that the Delts had
to play each other so early is
fairly sad, but seeing as how
the brackets were drawn out
of a hat, it could not really be
hleped. A cruel trick of fate
for PDT.

The tourney’s big upset so
far was the outstanding effort
pulled by PGD in defeating the
powerful Ghetto by a 59-42
score. Superb play ys Many
(Stick) Williamson and
hot shooting by Bob Sanders
gave PGD their biggest win of
the year.
In one of the roughest games
of the year, the Gamms un-
fortunately lost the services of
their other top-notch player
Chris (Mr. Hustle) Young who
sprained his ankle halfway
through the game when he at-
tempted to draw a charge on
the bleachers.

He was called for the
blocking foul by referees
Edgar (Spaceman) Weir and
Mitch Balcom.

SAE #1 survived a pretty
tough opening round opponent
in the Midnight Tokers despite
Steve Miller’s 30 points. SAE’s

categories such as ‘‘all-ugly’’,
“all-prison’’, ‘‘all-mediocre”’,

A short description of the
team, and why each member
rates that singular honor, is
also required.

There is one other
stipulation. Each member of
the teams must be real, not
fictionalized. The teams may
be in any team sport.

Entries may be sent any
time-between now and March
21, 1974. The winners will be
selected and the teams printed

of March 28) of THE DAVID-

season long passes to three

semi-finals.

The Tokers managed to
recover fast from their defeat
at the Gozinya palace. The
Tokers did blame their loss on
the ineffectual play of point
man Alec (Hawk) Hoon.

Team spokesman David
(Super Chicken) Kittrell said
Hoon was going to have his
“ST’’ privileges revoked for

CAPTAIN AMERICA

the rest of the year.

The B-League tourney is
progressing rather well at the
moment with favorites for the
crown WAO (a misplaced
A league team), the
MG's, led by the Strong
Brothers, and well rounded
IFT coached by the Adolph
Rupp-Phog Allen combination
of Kirk Combe and Ken
Schmaden.

May you all come unstuck in
time.

IMAC tournament play was in full swing this week, with 8

teams left battling for the title.

Cartmill Seeks New Football Alignment

By MARK WILENSKY
Sports Editor

Having been on the job but a
few short weeks, new Athletic
Director Thom A. Cartmill is
already trying to cope with the
maze of problems facing
Davidson's athletic

Cartmill talked first of the
football program, pointing out
that while the Wildcats were
still members of the Southern
Conference, they wouldn’t
play the necessary five games
to qualify for the cham-

“T feel that by reducing our
competition we can bring foot-
ball back to a high level of
’ said Cartmill.
“The plan ‘is to become a
division two team after the
next season, if the Ad-
ministration approves.

“We can be an immediate
challenger for the cham-
pionship of division two,” he
added.

“We will definitely remain
in Division I in basketball,”
Cartill said, ‘‘whether we go to
Division 2 in football or not, we
will remain in Division 1 in

Cartmill admitted that even
with the new ‘scholarship
based on need’’ program,
Davidson would still be paying
men to play football.

“We'll be doing the same
thing as the Ivy league schools
and many other schools of our
size. We never have given
many free rides, so I expect
the scholarship program to
cost about the same as
before,” Cartmill said.

“We won't be giving any
more money than the in-

dividual PCS form indicates,”’
he added.

The new head football coach

will not come from the present
personnel, according to Cart-
mill. ‘Coach Wade is going to
Army, Ernie Tall is going to
East Tennessee State and Bob
Mosketti is going to Marshall
University,’’ he said.

“They all did great gobs for
Davidson and we're sorry to
see them go,” Cartmill said.
“We're most fortunate that
Dave Roberts is staying, and
right now he is doing a fan-
tastic job of recruiting. He’s
doing the work of more than
one man,’’ he added.

Cartmill said that in order to
get the program off in a new

coach. ‘‘But Dave Roberts has
been assured a job at David-
son College,” he said.

“We've had a tremendous
amount of applications for the
head coaching position,’’ Cart-
mill said, ‘‘and hopefully we'll
have a new coach in two or
three weeks.”’

Cartmill said that, together
with his Tom
Scott, and the administration,
he will work to find a new
coach and also would seek
some type of player input.

Cartmill said that he is most
interested in improving the
IMAC and P.E. programs.
“Chip Stone needs a secretary
badly,”’ he said. ‘‘We’ve got to
improve that communication
in that part of the program.”’

Stone will continue as soccer
coach for now, but Cartmill
stressed that his main respon-

sibility is in the areas of

physical education and in-
tramurals.

“The soccer team needs a
coach with the time to do a
good job, as do the other
programs,’’ Cartmill noted. ‘‘I
believe that Chip Stone will be
able to continue handling
these jobs well.

ts Cartmill said that a woman
sports instructor will be added
to the staff and will especially
be interested in tennis, gym-

nastics and swimming.
Cartmill cut the interview
short to ‘let President Spen-
cer beat me at tennis.”’ If all
his instincts are that good, the
athletic program is in good
