THE DAVIDSONIAN

“TRACKMEN SWING INTO ACTION |

CAT TRAX
As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Interest for the past week has right-
ly been focused on the Southern
Tournament in Atlanta. It was a
great bunch of teams that started the
scrap, and it was a great team that
won. All three Tar Heel entries ac-
quitted themselves in a manner, cal-
culated to bring admiration and praise
to each team. Carolina used to be the
whole noise, but the Red Terrors of
N. C. State and the Duke Blue Devils
showed that the Phantom’s days of
absolute supremacy are ended.

Washington and Lee faded from
the picture in rather startling fash-
ion, and local dopesters are having
a hard time figuring it all out. The
Generals must have gone stale all
at once as the best of teams some-
times do.

Must have been a tough pill for the

Tar Heels when Duke slipped the
works over them by doubling the
count. Twice before the two quints

had met, and twice the Blue and White
of the Tars had waved triumphantly.
Such is basketball.

Goodwin of State and Croson of
Duke are conclusive proof of what
a tall center can mean to a team.
Davidson felt this lack on many
occasions this season. Had lanky
Ben Wilson been back in harness
to throw his long body in the path
of attempted shots and to get the
top-off most of the time, there
might have been a very different
tale for the Wildcats. We pick
Goodwin for our All-State center
with a good deal of hesitation, for
Croson is good.and there’s no doubt
on that point. Goodwin's longer
service and slightly better all-
around play wins for him, though,
in our estimation.

Rainy weather has certainly played
havoc with early track operations,
more so this year than in previous sea-
sons, it seems. The dash men were
not in any sort of shape to participate
in the big indoor meet at the Univer-
sity last Saturday, and as a result Da-
vidson’s entrants were few in num-
ber. Again the need of an indoor gym
large enough to accommodate a track
and suitable basketball facilities arises.

We look for Davidson’s track
season to be better than usual.
Captain Pritchett has worked won-
ders with some of his charges. If
the seconds and thirds can be.
amassed with a little more regu-
larity the Wildcats are due to ride.
Duke frocked the Cats last year
on places in the distance runs, but
the Cats look better in this depart-
ment now. Ely and Lafferty are
looking mighty good for the mile
and half-mile. The two-mile grind
is a tough one to fill. Wonder if
“Chief” Beavers and his running
mate Rut Nunan are coming
through?

Joe Gardner's winning of the high
jump over at Carolina looks encourag-
ing. Of course, 5 ft. 7 in. isn’t so much,
but the season is early and there’s no
reason why quite a few inches may
not be added to Mr. Gardner’s jump
Saturday.

March 22 will usher in King
Baseball and when that first ball
sails over the plate the Wildcats
are going after them from then on.
Oak Ridge never fails to bring a
cracking good nine to Davidson.
They always have the’ pitchers
somehow or other. Monk’s boys
plastered the Cadet’s star out of
the box last spring and won hand-
ily, but this time there will be the
same hard battle. Oak Ridge is a
prep school but their teams are
worthy of many colleges.

University of Kentucky—(CNC)—At
a meeting of the men’s study council re-
cently, two men students at the University
were tried for the violation of the liquor
resolution passed recently by the council.
The two men, both of whom were sus-
pended from the university, were said
to have been under the influence of liquor
at the Stroller dance. Such a defense
as “drinking in order to prevent catch-
ing the flu at the dance,” proved inef-
fective, according to members of the
council who tried the case.

In choosing an All-State team for
the season of 1929, there is a distinct
feeling of inadequacy. The state teams
produced so many stars for every
position that it is very difficult to
pick a quint and do justice to every
one of the deserving players. We
offer two teams, one really as good
as the other. On our second team we
move Captain Hackney of Carolina to
guard, a position he played at various
times with much success. Aside from
this change all the men fit into their
places.

Center offered two outstanding men
in Goodwin and Croson, both giants in
stature, demons on offense, and in-
valuable in stopping enemy shots. By
virtue of longer service and slightly
more consistent play Goodwin gets the
first call.

The forwards were the hardest prob-
lem. Satterfield, Councillor, Pritchett,
and Dowtin have all been stars of the
first water. The two former have
probably been a little more consistent
in their shooting than the two latter,
though even that is a doubtful prop-
sition.

Werber has played spectacular and
steady ball. He is a splendid shot and
a beautiful floor man. Bill Goodson,
playing his first season on the David-
son varsity has more than proved his
worth, in estimation. He gives
promise of being one of the real stars
of the state in another year. Warren
of State was very good, his. hoorwork
being well-nigh perfect, and his guard-

Sophomore Pugs Win
Boxing Tournament

Frosh Take Second Place, While
Juniors and Seniors Trail

By placing winners in four classes
and possibly a fifth which has not yet
been decided, the Sophomore class
won the boxing tournament Thursday,
February 28, with the huge total of
55 points; the Freshmen came next
with 25 points while the Juniors and
Seniors showed themselves less pug-
naciously inclined than the under-
classes, registering 10 and 6 points, re-
spectively.

Gold medals were awarded to the
winners in each division. No awards
were given to the second place men ex-
cept that the runnerup © position
brought six points to his class. Points
for third and fourth place were di-
vided rather than have another scrap

There were only two knock-outs in

Wildcats Complete
Strenuous Schedule

Younger’s Charges End Season
With Better Than Even
Break

With the State tilt last Saturday
night the Davidson Wildcats brought
to a close a basketball season that, un-
til the too strenuous schedule began
to have its inevitable results, was
crowned with much more than a fair
degree of success. Although playing
a cage schedule that included some of
the leading basketball outfits in the
south and not a real “set up” in the
whole bunch Coach Younger’s men
came out of the fracus with more than
an even break. Credit to the 'Cats.

The Wildcat courtmen, with prac-
tically all the material untried got off
at a comparatively slow start. In their
first two appearances on the court they
were set back by both Carolina and
Furman’s Purple Hurricane, but in
romping over Lenoir Rhyne, and Wof-
ford, in the following games much im-
provement in form was shown. It was
in drubbing the Monograms of Char-
lotte, however, that the Wildcats first
began to be taken seriously. Coach
Younger's zone defense was function-
ing to perfection and the professional
basketeers found themselves hopeless-
ly outclassed by the local courtmen.
This victory was quickly folowed up

by an even more pronounced win

Duke Blue Devils next invaded the

local lair but like V. P. I. was pow-
erless to keep pace with the fast step-
ping Wildcats.

At this point, however, the afore-
mentioned schedule came into play to
stop the speedy 'Cats where opponents
had failed. Six days grind in Virginia
with four big state games following
right on its heels was more than the
team could stand without
affect. Facing these
tions the best that the Davidson five
could accomplish on the Old Dominion

adverse condi-

journey was an even break. The fol-
lowing and last week proved the most
disastrous of the Wildcat’s season as
the down

worn aggregation suc-
cumbed before Duke, Carolina, and
State on successive nights, meeting

each on their own courts. As a result
of this trio of setbacks the, Wildcats
were forced to drop from second pos-
ition in the Big Five rating to their
ultimate stauding in fourth place.

For the Freshmen basketeers the
early part of the season was marked
by rather inconsistent form. In the
later games, however, the Wildkittens
came through with plenty of good bas-
ketball to finish a far from unsuccess-
ful. season. Although no other Big
Five yearling outfit was encountered
by Coach Tilson’s crew, comparative
scores show the Wildkittens to have
been well up in the realm of first year
quints in the state.
