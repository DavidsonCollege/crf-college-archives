Who’s that? Are they “together”? Is that the
new girl? Oh, you haven’t heard yet?

Lines such as these are just-a few of those
frequently heard around campus. Often these words
are spoken in connection with a fleeting, wonder-
ing glance. This kind of talk suggests an obsession
our society has with defining dating: an obsession
that is particularly prevalent here at Davidson.

For kicks, place yourself in the following
scenario. A girl asks a guy to go with her to amovie
one night. Because of the
size and limited entertain-

Who can decipher the boundaries and step-
ping stones that differentiate between “seeing
each other,” “dating,” and “going out.” Many
people adopt the idea that “going out” is synony-
mous with exclusively dating. That may seem
clear enough, but there does not seem to be such
a precise definition for either “dating” or the
cliche “seeing each other.” Some say the differ-
ence between the two words may be found in
intent or the lack thereof, Others say the definition
may be found in the activities that occur behind
closed doors. Following this idea, where should
we file the frequent encounters around Patterson

Court? Perhaps, such oc-

ment options around David-
son, the couple is of course
seen by many of their fel-
low classmates. When the

currences cannot be filed
under any traditional head-
ing. What we need are some
new terms.

Maybe, what actually goes

on lookers see the couple

kissing at the Movies at the

Lake, they turn to one another and whisper the
question, “Are they are going out”? And the cycle
of unending comments and questions starts. Infor-
mation gathering, story exchanges, sighting com-
parisons and general banter follow an initial sight-
ing. No juicy tidbit of detail remains unsaid. After
having gone on this “outing,” what exactly is the
status?

How does one define the situation? Is the fact
important that she asked him? Perhaps the activity
chosen is what makes the difference. . . or is it how
they say good-night? Is there another planned
outing at the end of the evening? In writing the
above, I carefully omitted the sensitive and offi-
cial term “date.” Without doing so, I would be
presuming that the couple was “dating,” when that
is not'the case.

on now isn’t dating. Is what

we call dating merely

“hooking-up”? Does the act really necessitate

labelling? Any word would have to be vague in

meaning. How does the label actually play a part
in what’s going on... or does it?

Challenge yourself: is what you say what

you really mean? Are you too using definitions

because it’s comfortable? Does defining make

describing the situation to your friends easier? .

Does a definition really clarify what’s happen-
ing? Do you define before giving time a chance to
play its role in sorting things out because you
obtain some feeling of being in control? Perhaps
definition provides validation. Trust yourself. You
‘know what’s going on. If you need a definition
and a fitting one doesn’t exist, make your own.
But first decide if it’s a definition that you actually
need.

Real Live Poets bring New York

Staff Writer

On Friday the 12", a trio of poets came to the
900 room. They came not to read their poetry but

to perform it. These three poets are members of
Real Live Poets, a band of performance artists
who draw inspiration from the Beat movement
that began in the 1950s. This movement empha-
sized the power of the spoken word. The Real Live
Poets are on a quest. Their quest is to take poetry
from its current position atop the marble pedestal
of academia and bring it down to the rest of us.
