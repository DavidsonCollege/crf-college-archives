Creationism vs. Evolutionism: a relevant issue?

By Stephen Faller

Ultimately, the question of
creation versus evolution is an
important one because people have
found a way to relate its answer to
their lives. There are many ways
of applying the issue to one’s life,
but over and over, the following
two views have presented them-
selves tome. Usually, in one cor-
ner, there is the furious fundamen-
talist, and in the other corner is the
angry atheist. :

In short, each extreme has a
point and a fault. Let’s start with
the side of our friend the furious
fundamentalist (henceforth re-
ferred to as fundie). Now, this is a
stereotype. I feel that Ican gener-
alize like this because I have been
something of each extreme in my
life. It is not my intention to point
the proverbial finger at anyone,
but create a caricature. Carica-
tures, by nature, are ridiculously
untrue, but they contain enough
truth about them so that the subject

is recognizable.

The fundie believes that his
importance comes from God. The
strength of the fundie position is
that the fundie believes himself to
be worthwhile. However, anything
gained from this understanding is
lost to the fundie’s flaw. That is,
too often the individual believes
he does not have to go out and
actively seek life. This extremist
“faith” is not an active trusting in
God (that would be believing that
everything could be accomplished
through God, andit worth trying to
do everything). No, it is an ‘inac-

"tive resignation. God tries to give

hope, and people try to give up. No
good. What good does it do, that a
man save his immortal soul, and

-have him throw away the very life

that his beloved God wanted him
to have?

The angry atheist is no better.
They often become angry atheists
because they recognize the resig-
nation of the fundie. To do away

with the resignation, they do away
with God andcreation. They don’t
want to gothrough life finding out,
when they get to the end of it, that
they have not lived. Understand-
able. The only trouble is, in doing
away with God, they often doaway
with their very sense of self. Philo-
sophical materialism rules, and a
man is justnothing but parts. What
difference does it make that I go
out and get trashed tonight? I’m

just a collection of protons, neu-.

trons, and electrons; there is no
right or wrong, so I might as well
have all the funIcan. Butthisisn’t
any good either, and this life of
orgiastic nihilism is no better than
a life of pious resignation.

The fact of the matter is, the
individual has a self, and no matter
how hard one tries to convince
themselves that they are just elec-
trons, they never truly believe it in
their hearts. In order to feel love,
betrayal, hurt, or anything, one
must have a self. It is almost as if

the large amount of hurt in the
world serves as a proof of the self.
Something must be feeling the hurt.

I ultimately defer to the most
fundamental source of all. I quote
from the coptic gospel of Thomas,
“Jesus said: If the flesh came into
existence because of the spirit, it is
a marvel. But if the spirit came
into existence because of the body,
itisa marvel of marvels. But as for
me, I wonder at this, how this great
wealth made its home in this pov-
erty.”

I don’t know which happened
(creation or evolution). I wasn’t
there, but I’m here, isn’t that
enough? It doesn’t matter, be-
cause for some reason we have
selves and lives, and we’d better
figure out what to do with them.

To the annoying extremists
on both sides of the issue, I close
with this: go home and find a real
issue, such as how one might go
about a well spent life in such a
sick and dead world.

Blame it on Texas

Country
isn't just beer.
and barstools

By Susanna Young

Okay, I know what it is. I
know why, after reading my last
column, every single one of you
doesn’t have at least one country
music station on memory on your
car radio. It’s the drinking, isn’t it?
As most of us are under-aged and
inexperienced in the world of alco-
hol, you all just can’t identify with
many of the songs that talk about
bars and drinking. If you think
about it, though, it’s obvious why
alcohol is such a prevalent topic
for country music writers—could
you sing John Anderson’s “Money
in the Bank” sober?

Well, here’s my solution (I’m

always thinking). Country music
has lots of other great topics. In the
immortal words of my childhood
hero and adolescent idol, David
Allan Coe, we still have “Mama,
or trains, or trucks, or prison.” So
what are you all so worried about?

Everyone has a mother. No
matter what you call her, you can’t
deny that you have one (unless you
slept through seventh grade biol-
ogy, and I’m sure I knew about my
mom before the seventh grade).
You can identify with this topic, so
stop squirming and pay attention
to the rest of the article.

Trains are a mode of transpor-
tation that is slowly becoming ob-
solete, and it’s a shame. I myself
have had the opportunity to ride a
few trains. I’m not talking about
the trains that rode around the park
by the zoo, whose seats I couldn’t
squeeze my backside into now with
some help from a crowbar. And
I’m not talking about the subway.
I mean real live, cross-country,
passenger trains. Itis an incredible
experience to feel the wheels turn
beneath you and to see the open
country stretched out before your
eyes. So ride a train.

The problems of breaking your spell-checker

By Chris Frampton
Oh tragedies of tragedies.
Now UNCC is in for the sort of
shock treatment that the once illus-
trious Davidson College experi-

_ enced at the beginning of this

school year. They, however, in
their infinite, institutional wisdom,
have dealt with a crisis of epic
proportions in a manner becoming
their enormous size. They have
completely and totally and redun-
dantly done as others have done
before them. Though they have
also taken immediate measures to
avoid the unavoidable trauma that
would most assuredly result were
they to allow a crisis of such
magnamious implications to result
from the mistakes of others.

That’s right. They kicked my
butt out.

Why? Why do such an awful
and terrible thing that could bring
people tostarve themselves in pro-
test. Well, it turns out, I didn’t get
my rabies shot. (Which would
explain why I am always frothing
at the mouth—actually may be all
of that beer I drink to look cool
explains that.)

But unlike our once illustri-
ous college, my new prosecutors
have added a clause to the contract

of termination: I can get back inif
I allow some monestrous woman
to stick a needle into my butt.

So, no worries.

However, in my pursuit of jus-
tice in this case, I learned an inter-
esting thing about UNCCstudents:
if they have classes before three
o’clock they have to get their shots.
If they don’t, they can have any-
thing they want disease wise. The
result of this ridiculous regulation
is obvious and it can be seen every
day in my chemistry class which is
in the wee hours of the evening.

In the front row, people liter-
ally drool over the professor's ev-
ery word. In the back row, stu-
dents scream in pain.as their in-
sides eat at them. And each and
every class, some leper raises their
arm to ask a question and it falls off
and intosomeone else’s lap. (That
is tasteless humor; if you can call it
humor atall.)

But life at UNCC is joyous.
To date I have talked to exactly
two people, both of whom were
about as cool as, I don’t know, Bill
Gullan. They seemed to think I
was just a freshmen, a baby so to
speak. I guess they saw me walk-
ing to and from class alone, my
head down, my shoulders drooped

as I contemplated the shear brain
power of the students with whom I
had just taken a class. The sight
must have thrust pity into their
hearts and they askedifI wanted to
go to a Charlotte Knights’ game
with some college version of the
glee club that they led. It hurt my
pride when [had to tell them to get
away before I shot them through
the throat. Speaking of guns. Did
you know, that if I wanted to, if I
was crazy enough, orbored enough,
I could walk into Roses, throw
three hundred dollars on the
counter, walk out with a semi-au-
tomatic weapon, and kill everyone
in the parking lot? Just a thought.

Butbackto UNCC, where they
don’t allow guns on campus. Idid
meet one other person. Well, I
overheard him talking toa teacher.
Basically, he said, “I am sorry if
there are some spelling mistakes
on this paper but my spell checker
is broken on my computer so I
couldn’t get all the words right.”
The teacher laughed and said, “Oh
that’s all right, I won’t pay atten-
tion to them unless the mistakes
really start to add up.” Folks, we
go to the wrong school, even if we
dohave rabies and really like morn-
ing classes. Take your core
thingies. :

Seay Rations
Beavis,

Butthead,
and Nathan

By Nathan Seay

Perhaps this sounds familiar:
you’re sitting in history class,
studying about World War Two or
something. The professor is lec-
turing about D-Day. “And thus,
the Allies were able to penetrate
far enough...”

You don’t hear anything else
for about five minutes because you
keep saying to yourself “He said
penetrate. Huh huh huh uh huh
huh.”

Yes, ladies and gentleman, I
have a problem (well, another one
anyway): Beavis and Butt-Head
are ruining my academic career. I
now can laugh at anything. Biol-
ogy class is impossible; I don’t
know of one that never mentions
“sex” or “organism.”

(Sorry about the lack of
coninuity--Nathan has been cen-
sored.) Art class is full of naked
people. Chemistry is difficult be-
cause I’m always tempted to raise
my hand and ask the professor how
to make something that will “pack
a mean buzz.” Even the word
“but” can set me off.

I don’t want to give Beavis
and Butt-Head a bad rap. They’ve
already gotten knocked about by
parent groups concerned with the
evil pouringinto their children from
the TV. (I guess none of these
people have ever thought of throw-
ing the thing away.)

I personally think that there
are several good things to say about
the show. Look at Beavis and
Butt-Head’s economic back-
ground. They don’t live in such a
nice neighborhood. They don’t
have cars or even a change of
clothes, yet Beavis and Butt-Head
arecontent. They know thatmoney
can’t buy happiness (even though
it is cool). And pay attention,
parents of lazy kids: Beavis and
Butt-Head have jobs. They’ve
tempted me so many times to get a

job at McDonald’s just so I can
man the drive-through window:
“We’reclosed orsomething. Drive
around to the . . . Uh, hello?”

Another reason that I like
Beavis and Butt-Head so much is
that they glorify being stupid. At
last we stupid people of the world
have someone to look to for guid-
ance. What should we do with our
lack of brainpower and overabun-
dance of hormones? Beavis and
Butt-Head give us suggestions
three times a day. It’s about time
the PC movement started paying
attention to stupid people.

I’m also sick and tired of see-
ing beautiful people on TV all the
time. I know of no landlord that
looks like Heather Locklear and
none of this year’s freshmen looks
‘like Jason Priestly (maybe next
year, ladies). Beavis and Butt-
Head are making a stand for ugly
people going through the ugliest
time in their lives — puberty.

Beavis and Butt-Head are de-
stroying me, but at least they’re

teaching me how to have fun at the
bottom of the heap.
