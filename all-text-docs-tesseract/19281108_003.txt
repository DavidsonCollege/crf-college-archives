$1,000 Offered for
Only One Sentence

Why write home for money? Here's
an easier way out.

The Music Industries Chamber of Com-
merce, 45 West 45th Street, New York
City, offers $1,000 for x good, snappy sen-
tence of only a few words, provided they
are the right words. This sum is the prize
to be paid for the slogan best expressing
the thought that music is a prime means
of self-expression and culture and that
there are hours of pleasure in store for
those who learn to play some sort of a
musical instrument. No limit is put on
the number of words in any slogan sub-
mitted, but contestants are reminded that
the best slogans are short ones and that a
single sentence, if brief and peppy, “packs
a punch” more powerful than a whole vol-
| ume of words.

Anyone is eligible to enter the contest
and there is no limit upon the number of
slogans any one person may submit, pro-
vided they are mailed to the Music Indus-
tries Chamber of Commerce before Jan-
| uary 1, the closing date of the contest.
| The judges who will decide the winner
are S. L. Rothafel, (“Roxy”) New York
movie impressario; Dr. Frank . Crane,
journalist-essayist; and Frank Presbrey,
advertising authority.

| Leaflets explaining the contest may be
| obtained at any music dealer’s or from
the Chamber direct.

Come Back Chickens

University of Arizona—An irreparable
setback to the chances of the University
of Arizona for national prestige has been
dealt. Last week five valuable hens, who
were leading their pens in egg-laying,
which in turn were ahead of the entire
United States in the national egg-laying
contest, were stolen, This was a fatal
blow to the University’s prospects for the
first place in the national contest, as with-
out the record of these five birds, the
poultry farm’s chances are practically
destroyed.

According to Harry Embleton, head of
the poultry department, the University
has spent $5,000 on the poultry farm and
its blooded fowls in four years, the eggs
from the original stock of the stolen hens

costing $10 apiece. The poultry depart-
ment has been carefully breeding select
stock in order to win the national contest.
Each year its entrants have come a little
closer to doing so, and the goal was ex-
pected to be reached this year,

The contest runs for an entire year, but
the scores have not been computed since
August, at which time Arizona was lead-
ing the nation, The records of these birds
for the remainder of October would have
been essential for winning, as.the nearest
contestants are only a few eggs behind.

Down deep in the Kongo the native sons
believe that anybody who has an explorer for
dinner will absorb all the brains, courage
and other success-assuring virtues of the unfor-
tunate victim. :

‘We wish wecould say thesame of Chesterfields
—that all their popularity is conferred upon
whosoever smokes them. Frankly, however,
this is not invariably true. Several Chesterfield

smokers have recently been discovered who
are not ambassadors, steel kings, or even bank

presidents,

But—since Chesterfields are so satisfying, mild
and different—we'll all of us continue to enjoy
them for these sound smoke-virtues alone.

Popularity? Six million smokers are enjoying
‘em today. Such popularity must be deserved,

Make it six million and one?
