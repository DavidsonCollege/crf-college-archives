TRACK TEAM MAKES SPLENDID
SHOWING AGAINST BLUE DEVILS

BY BILL MARQUESS

Hats off to the track team for

a magnificent showing against
Duke! Led again by the versatile
Wade Barrow and Monroe Wicker
Pete Whittle’s hustlers outdid them-
take from
the renowned Dukes. Bailey Wil-
liams came within six feet of the
school record when he hurled the
discus 132 feet to capture first
place in the event. Bill Morse, the
Blue Devil's great two-miler, was
ineligible to make the trip, thus
cheating the spectators out of a
chance to see some real steppin’.
Boo Walker cut another five sec-
onds off his record in the two-mile.
If he keeps that up, it won't be long
before he breaks minutes.
Frank Brown did a nice piece of
work in the same event by beating
out Koop of Duke for second place.
Chet Chapman really hit the nail
on the head Friday night in the
Stud Store when he predicted that
the 'Cats would take forty points

selves to forty points

Nice Going, Boys

While the track team was put-
ting up such a scrap, the golfers
threw a terrific scare into the Duke
Camp by coming within one stroke
of tieing the latter for first honors
in the Southern Conference Tour-
nament. Charlie Ross, sharpshoot-
ing veteran who has been leading
the team all year, was hindered by
sickness from playing and this may
have cost Davidson the champion-
