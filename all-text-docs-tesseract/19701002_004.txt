Final Fraternity Action

It is gratifying to be able to report at last that
Davidson’s fraternity system seems..destined for im-
mediate and radical reform.

With the public support of President Spencer,
the recommendations of the Student Life Commit-
tee (SLC) which were meant by that group to be the
definitive guidelines for change may actually be im-
plemented as final. bass

Our only reason for caution is that the group
with the real power to change anything at David-
son, that is the trustees, will not conclude the issue
for another two weeks. f

It is to this homecoming meeting that all pro-
ponents of effective change must direct their ef-
forts. The time before that meeting must be used to
the best advantage to promote the current recom-
mendations. ;

For these proposals have’ much in their favor.
They offer an immediate outline of change, but it
is a plan which allows adequate time for resolving
problems which might arise.

It has been said by some ‘in response to the re-
ports that a random distribution of freshmen into
eating clubs will never be a workable solution to
present problems. “

However, with evidence that such systems work
elsewhere the attitude to be, taken is one that
asserts that the method must be made to work.

We have been given a final, authoritative, and
well justified program of reform, and now is no
time to suggest that the search for an ideal sys-
tem should be continued.

It is important to realize that the initial reform
of the fraternities is not the final aspect of the
SLC: report even though that is by far the most
‘important aspect of the plan for present students.

The reforms continue long after that day when
Davidson’s last student fraternity member has °fad-
ed from the scene. Ultimately, the goal (and it seems
to’be a most worthwhile goal) is for integration of
social and residence hall life.

’ But even looking that far in the future we must
join the SLC in keeping one eye to reforms in the
present. The chance is before us.

Surely we can do more, as Dr. Spencer said,
than sit by and wait for total disintegration.

Ideas Worth Noting

In approaching issues of change with. regard
to fraternities or other issues on this campus it
seems valuable to reemphasize several points made
by Dr. Spencer in the conclusion to his address
Monday.

Basically Spencer noted that colleges must re-
main somewhat better than and somewhat above
the society whose ideals we .seek to promote.

The campuses of the world and this campus
must remain sanctuaries of reason and rational dis-
agreement in 4 society where these qualities are
fast eliminated by the polarization of closed minds.

For if colleges are to be effective liberal and
educational forces in a world that needs these forces
as badly as ours does, the colleges cannot allow
themselves to join the society in its shortcomings.

We cannot allow. ourselves to succumb to the
influences of intolerance and disrespect which: make
most impossible.

We cannot let ourselves be blinded by the lack
of perspective that binds society to false solutions
and tired ideas. :

Yet this need for perspective applies to issues
endemic to the campus as. well as to the broader
issues of society. Only when we can see our own
problems relative to the larger problems of life
and society will we be able to treat them without
exagerration and with a rationality that precludes
unnecessary strife. :

- And only when campuses makes it clear to the
world that the method of reason is their approach

ill they regain the confidence that their leader-
ship uires of society. ae

Without this leadership colleges and their mem-
bers are needlessly frustrated in their pursuit of
ideals. Yet without this pursuit of ideals, society
_can never prosper.

Maybe Randomization ~

Charlotte and Davidson
have more in common than
you think.

You see, Charlotte is one
of those places where many
of (if not most) of the rest-
aurants (including especial-
ly the Italian and kosher
ones) ‘are run by Greeks.

Up until recently ‘Greeks’
ran the major food services

for. Davidson  upperclass-
men.
‘Lately though, spiraling

operating costs and accom-
panying bill increases have
forced those in precariaus
financial states to adopt
less expensive’ diets. And
some were just tired of the
menu.

This in turn has” reduced
the revenue collected by the
college from active fraterni-
ity ‘members; overcrowded
Kleeburg’s Union facilities:
increased “electrical _ bills
and the possibility of fire
from dorm cooking; and
boosted the Coffee Cup's
business.

In the midst of the Bur-
sar’s headaches even Dar-
von couldn't ease, the Stu-
dent Life (Committee has re-
leased its recommendations
in an attempt to cure every-
one's indigestion with David-
son’s fraternity situation.

The SLC has recommend-
ed, with ‘President Spencer's
qualified endorsement, that
the Greek restaurants be
phased out with gradual re-
placement by a new chain.

The proposed restaurant

chain should solve’ more
problems than it creates. We
hope.

But we'll have to spend a
fortune on black ink for the
business office; the data pro-
cessing center will have to
program the random assign-
ment of the new chain's
clientele and produce a bill-

ing system; and the Coffee .

Cup will have to learn to
live without ‘student’s busi-
ness.

The really sad thing: about
it all is the loss of atmos.
phere. Without the quaint,
squiggly letters, the houses
just won't be the same.

Randomization is likely to
destroy the flavor ‘of’ each
house’s clientele. What will
happen when we split up
close knit groups of jocks,
eggheads, hotdogs, flits, cool
gups, clods, iand other com-
mon bonds found in each
freshmen ‘Class?

And think how dulf ‘Fall
will be without upperclass-
men sneaking around rush

rules to get buddy-buddy :

with freshmen they want to
be brothers.

Nasser once mentioned

Egypt, the Arab world and

in each of these circles
Nasser was a leading figure
(indeed the feading figure

United States was perceived |

as a main enemy.

‘instability in these. areas.
