Beth Manson:
Strengthening the Wildcats

By Larry Dagenhart

Just who is that woman out on
the football field coaching discus-
throwers and shot-putters when she
isnotplaying with her dog, “Jesse”?
Itis Beth Manson, one of the newest
members of the Davidson athletic
staff. Manson is the assistant
women’s assistant track and field
coach, but is also playing a major
role in getting many of Davidson’s
athletes on strength and condition-
ing programs. She works with
athletes from all sports except
football.

Mansen comes to Davidson
with a biology degree from Bowl-
ing Green University, where she
wasan All-American in the discus.
Her junior and senior years saw
her place seventh and sixth in the
nation, respectively, in the event.
Herstrong credentials also include
significant background in sports

medicine, anatomy, physiology
and first aid.

Manson’s arrival seriously
bolstered a Davidson athletic pro-
gram lacking in the areaof strength
and conditioning. “Most of our
athletes haven’ thad the benefits of
great programs and great coaches,”
notes Manson, whose presence
changes that considerably. She
cites as the two main byproducts of
strength training stronger athletes
and, more importantly, heightened
injury prevention. “It is one of the
best things an athlete can do and is
a tremendous help when done
right,” she added.

In terms of goals for Wildcat
sports teams, Manson would sim-
ply like to see a gradual improve-
ment in all of them. “I think weight-
lifting could play an importantrole
in that,” she said. “I have seen a
tremendous improvement in my

Smashing The Records

By Peter Hurtado

The women’s track and field
team enters their final two weeks
of competition poised to attack the
record books again. The women,
who have broken 13 indoor and
outdoor records thus far, contin-
ued their campaign over spring

’ break with meets at UNC-

Wilmington, the Snowbird Invita-
tional, Coke-Florida Relays, and

, the Wake Forest Relays.

Heather Tarpley continues to
rewrite the books. Tarpley came

on strong to win the discus at Wake

id peach a

team, in their attitudes and what
they want to get out of it.” Manson
also sees strength and condition-
ing as a means to recruit better
athletes to Davidson. She men-
tioned that “more coaches are in-
formed” about it and that having
the program here could attract top
high school performers.
Women’s tennis coach Caro-
line Price, whose team currently
boasts a 16-7 record, says that her
charges have certainly benefitted
from better strength and condi-
tioning. Said Price, “It has been an
invaluable part of my program as

strength has become more of a -

factor. It was Lendl and Martina
who really brought in a strength
game. But before they camealong,
(tennis players) didn’t train as well
as they should have. I’ve already

up his second win of the year,
giving up four runs in seven in-
nings while striking out seven.

On Wednesday, Davidson
traveled to Winston-Salem to take
on the Wake Forest Demon Dea-
cons. Wake Forest scored three
runs off Wanzenberg in the first
inning and the ‘Cats could nothelp
Wanzenberg as they scored only 2
runs, losing 4-2:

If the bats wake up for the rest
of the season and the Big South
Tournament, the Wildcats could
be in excellent shape to suprise
some teams in the tournament.

“We have no breathers the rest
of the way and I’m not thrilled
about having to play so many road
games,” said Cooke. He adds,
however, that “the right guy on the
mound can even things out on the
road.”

The Wildcats will definitely
need the right guys as they face
tough competition such as Duke,
Wake Forest, Appalachian State
and UNC-Charlotte.
