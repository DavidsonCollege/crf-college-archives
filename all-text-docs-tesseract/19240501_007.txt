Who Knows?

The first issue of what is today the
Davidson College Magazine was publish-
ed in February, 1886, but at that time
was entitled the Davidson College Monthly.
The magazine has had a continuous pub-
lication since that time, the present year
being the thirty-ninth, It was in 1899
that the name was changed from Month-
ly to Magazine. :

The first issue contained thirty-three

pages and probably holds the record for |

advertising matter as only three per cent
of space, the back page, was given over
to this department. Instead
edited by an editor-in-chief and his
staff, the magazine was run by three
men elected by each of the two literary
societies.

Announcing that Davidson had recent- |

ly been connected with the outside world
by a telegraph line, the first issue follow-
ed with the statement that “we are told
that macadam walks will soon follow.”

In April, 188) a skating rink for the
use of the 100 Davidson students was set
up by one of the professors in an up-
stairs room downtown, Over 70 pairs of
skates Were purchased and the expenses
were promised not to exceed thirty cents
a month.

In the decade preceding the erection
of the Y. M. C. A, building (now used as

the armory) the freshman receptions

held with any foreign organization was
a baseball game with Charlotte the day

The game was played in Charlotte.

, The Christian Endeavor

Shearer Hall, 1. =. Deck led the class in
several songs, after which several members
of the class rendered short sentence prayers.
W. W. Purdy, president of the class, read

that the program committce which is to he
appointed by the president, will have charge

The clection of officers for next year fol-
lowed. They are as follows: W. E. Mil-}
ton, president; A. H. Hollingsworth, vice |
/president; D. M. Calhoun, secretary; and

on the Laurinburg Convention, held at Lau-
jrinburg during the week-end of the 20th.
| Bowie represented the class in Junior work,
|and reported that several deputations are in
‘line for the near future. A representative
‘of the class visited Mooresville last Sunday
|to arrange for a social between the Moores-
| ville Senior Endeavorers, the Davidson Sce- |

|Class. This social will take place around |

J. A. Lake and W. C. Ramsey have just
returned from the national Scabbard and
Blade convention, which was held at the
University of Illinois.

The R. O. T. C. department has asked’ per-

Washington for regular uniforms for the
advanced course here. Samples have been
received and the selection of material will
be made shortly.

New regulations for the military depart-
ment will be off the press within a week. A
coat of arms and a motto has been adopted
by the same department. The coat of arms
was drawn by W. M. Heston, of Davidson,
and the motto was adopted by the Scabbard
and Blade.

Captain Ellis has received his orders to re-
port to his future post. Davidson regrets
the loss of Captain Ellis, because he has been |
doing a great service here.

It will be hard to |
get one who will fiill the place that he has |
occupied for four years. Not only has he |
|done good work in the military line, but ie
jhas assisted, in other lines as well. This
lspring he has proven of invaluable aid in
coaching the track team, Captain Ellis will
report to Fort Riley, Kansas, at the Cavalry
school there. This is considered a most de- |
sirable assignment. He will avail himself of
fa three months’ leave of absence before re-|
| porting to his new post in September. |

OLD AND NEW “Y” CABINETS |
GATHER FOR JOINT PICNIC |
Last Thursday evening the old and |

cabinets of the Y. M.-C. A, gathered together |

for a joint picnic. The purpose of the pienic |
was to give both the cabinets a closer rela- |
tion to each other and to discuss possibilities |
for the work of next year. |

The picnic was held in Jetton’s pasture, |
where the events connected with the feed |
took place in true camp style. Warren Cox |
acted as chief cook, and performed his duties |
| well. Mr. Jackson |

were his ablest assistants. The picnic was |

Professor Fleagle and
very successful throughout.

]| over the cabinets joined for discussion in con-

nection with futire work. Professor Fleagle
and Mr. Jackson, of the “Y” Board of Con-

trol, made short talks in regard to the im-
portance and possibilities of carrying the
work forward. Warren Cox, of the retiring
cabinet, made some timely suggestions for
remedying certain evils existing on the
campus.

The success‘of the picnic was due to the
ladies of the town. Mrs. Williams was in
charge and those assisting her were Mrs.
Jackson, Mrs. Lingle, Mrs. Arbuckle, Mrs.
A, Currie, Mrs. Erwin, and Mrs. Fleagle.

In the mind of every serious
thinking college man there arises a
question—“What am I going to do
after graduation?” This question
presents a serious crisis. It de-
mands a definite decision.

In an unusual degree the Life
Insurance business combines the
opportunity for conspicuous bus-
iness success with the opportunity
for real social service. Here is a
profession that is eminently worthy
of consideration.
