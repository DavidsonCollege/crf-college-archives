CAT-TALES

By TONI CASALI

WEDNESDAY, NOV. 2, 1938

Big Bill Johnston, Davidson's hefty 200-pound guard who sometimes
shifts over to aid the tackle positions,
the coming All-State selection with his
game. Bill has been a standout in the Wildcat line for the past two years
but this year he has risen to greater heights. In every game this season

certainly clinched a position on
fine performance in the Furman

does all that on the defense, but when Davidson gets possession of the
ball he pulls out and clears the path for ‘Cat backs. He kept Nolan,
Furman end, on the ground most of the time in last Saturday's game.
If Big Bill is overlooked.when the time comes for All-State selections

Bill has been a tower of defense
marks him as the best guard in the two Carolinas, barring none.

some of those so-called sports writers had better go out and buy glasses
Davidson's greatness lies in her line. If the small Wildcat backs
were put behind a slow-charging line they would be just out of
luck. It doesn’t mean that they are not good backs but it means
that the difference between a good team and a bad team is the
forward wall. Davidson has a good team. Maybe they didn’t beat
Duke, Carolina, N. C. State, or South Carolina, but Davidson just
isn’t supposed to beat those teams. We beat teams that represent
schools with similar enrollments like Citadel, Furman, and Erskine,
and the reason is that our line, led by Johnston, Captain Warden,
Bob Benfield, Luke Graham, and Harry Gasteiger, is better than
the average line.

That Davidson-Furman game was certainly a thriller. It looked
like Davidson was going to score right ter the opening: kigkoff but
bad breaks held them back Then in the second quarter Fred Stair
waltzed around end and did some faney sidestepping only to be caught
on the two-yard line after he had stepped off 59 yards. Davidson just

couldn't put it iys and lost possession of the ball. Furman
had a good break, recover i ‘Cat fumble deep in Davidson's ¢yrritory
and soon scored. Gene McEver must have told the ’Cats something nice
during the half because they came back the next quarter with a new

life and marched to Furman’s 20-yard line without stopping. Here Tubby

Hand plunged through center, sto momentarily on the ten-yard
stripe and then drove over uuble stripe. He didn’t get credit for
the fine touchdown ‘as he bled across the goal and Bob Benfield
potineed on the rolling oval like a bobeat. After this Furman proceeded

thrills, Davis, who has ne a placement—either. in

for the winning point!

Several Clemson Cadets, who go to school about 30 miles from
Furman’s campus, flocked over to Davidson stands and aided the
cheers greatly. In fact they almost drowned out the Furman cheer-
ing section at times. Doc Huff, who slings sodas at the College
Pharmacy, and a former member of Clemson's. student body and
football team, was certainly right whenche said that Clemson had

a fine bunch of boys in her student enrollment.

During football season, probably only a few know that a spert
called Cross-Country, is even in existence at Davidson. The Wildcats
boast of a good team this year—in fact last week Boo Walker and
Captain Dave Woodward broke the course record at Washington and |

Lee. This sport takes more energy than any two things on the campus

four miles every day, be vigor rcises and staying on

for their efforts. The meets are interesting too. A close finish, when
two opposing runners, dead tired from the gruelling race, put every-
thing they have left to outrun each other in the final few yards is as
thrilling a sight as one could wish for.

LAST WEEK’S STARS: BILL JOHNSTON—For his good

work in the Davidson line against Furman’s Purple Hurricane.

FRED STAIR—His 59-yard run in the second quarter of the
Davidson-Furman scrap was a neat exhibition of broken field run-
ning and gave the ’Cats the necessary spark to come back later and
upset the dope bucket.

BILL DAVIS—Completed a touchdown pass to Ned Iverson
that knotted the score and then praceeded to kick the extra point
that meant the markin of victory. He also had a good running av-
erage—better than four yards per try. |

TUBBY HAND—Played a fine defensive game and also scored
Davidson’s first marker on a plunge from the 20-yard line.
