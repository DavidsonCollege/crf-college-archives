When Wildcat guard
Gene Davis was hit in
the eye by somebody's
foot last week in the
State game, the blood
ran freely from the re-
sulting gash. But that
didn't stop Davis. In
the Cat dressing room
the medicos whipped a
needle through the skin
a couple times, packed
a little protection
around the injured area,
and Gene finished the
ball game.

It is not too far-
fetched an analogy, we
believe, to maintain that the whole Davidson team has per-
formed this season like Davis did in the State game. Knocked
down twice straight, without a victory to their credit, Bill Dole’s
Cats went into the State game trying once more for the victory
which has eluded them since early in the 1951 season.

This writer wasn't privileged to see the State fracas, but
the word from those who did is that Dole’s men looked pretty
sad during the first half of the game, but bounced back for a
good second half. That’s a little deviation from the usual, since
the Cats are generally a first half ball club. But at least they
showed the spark of competition, the signs of fight which meant
that they were still trying.

The question that arises is, of course, how long the Cats
can continue to get knocked down and still come up swinging.
There is a limit to the life of unnourished team spirit just as
there is a limit to human endurance, and when that spirit no
longer exists a team plays a game perfunctorily, with the attitude
that Since It Is Saturday We Will Play a Football Game Today.
That attitude is what Coach Dole has been trying to discourage
ever since he came to Davidson. If this team doesn't win pretty
soon he'll be hard put to keep his team from feeling that way.

All of which is not intended as criticism of Dole's charges.
A team with no real depth to speak of, they have played schools
with talent to spare. Everybody they play seems to be rebound-
ing from a humiliating defeat by somebody or in that state
of being “Up” (i.e., laying’) for them. Though they have
dropped their first three starts, they've worked hard almost all
the way. .

Tonight Dole’s men run smackdab into another situation
in which their opponents will be playing harder than at any
other time during the year. Though they've been picked by some
of the football prognosticators to win by a couple of TD's,
they'll be hard put to whip Presbyterian at the latter's Home-
coming. However, if they turn that trick it'll only be turnabout,
for the Blue-Hosed boys from Clinton edged out the'Cats here
last year 14-12 before a Homecoming crowd.

Since the game will probably be over by the time this issue
of the Davidsonian is published, there’s not much use to predict
the outcome. But we won't be a bit surprised if the long-over-
due Cats send a lot of PC faithful home tonight in not too good
a mood. ,

THE DAVIDSONIAN

By DICK ROPER

P.C. put the damper on David-
son’s homecoming festivities last
fall as they eked out a 14-12 vic-
tory.

Davidson was defeated 28-6 last
week by N.C. State in Raleigh,
which saw the Cats a bit shaky
in the first. half. The-second half
was a different story with the
sensational running of halfback
Johnny Gray.

Up until this game, Johnny
had never ran an offensive
play in his varsity experi.
ence. He scored Davidson's
only touchdown against State
with a 64-yard sprint off right
tackle. He should be running
a lot of offense from now on
and will add that spark that
the Cats have seemed to lack.
Injuries seem to be hampering

Davidson's victory hopes. Henry
Brown, hard running Wildcat full-
back, has been out since the first
game with a knee injury, and
Harry Peterson is still on the non-
playing list with an injury he re-
ceived a year ago. Captain Arnold
Whisnant, Ben Craig, and Gene
Davis were hurt in last week's
action, but all three may be ready
to go Friday night.

Davidson boasts the third best

in freshman halfback Bobby Renn.
If Renn can do as well as he has
so far, he'll keep the Cats out of

Lew Barnes, 20-year-old senior
from Bassett, Va., will captain the
Wildcat golfers this year.

Barnes won the honor at a meet-

for the Virginian.

Three years ago, golf was foreign
‘to Barnes as snow in the nether
regions. But the game had a real

At last week’s triangular meet

Tennessee, the Southeastern Con-

Maryville coming in second. In

Cross Country meet, Tennessee

There is no question as to this
week's favorite Wildcat. It could
be none other than the recently
converted defensive safety for the
Dolemen, who took off from a
halfback post for 64 yards through
the entire State College Wolfpack
to score the lone tally that the
Wildcats garnered last Saturday
afternoon. It's got to be the small,
160-pounder from Statesville who
is actually listed as the second-
string quarterback for the Cats.
It has: to be Johnny Gray.

Practicing Hard

-By MOODY SMITH

After absorbing a 6-3 drubbing

in dedicated practice, determined
not to let it happen again this
spring when the official season
opens.

In fact, Morris’ mates did just
as well. Bill Bivins was the only
Wildcat to win his match,

In doubles, McKee’s men did
considerably better, winning two
out of three. ;

The P.C. lineup seemed just as
strong as last year's, which was
by no means weak, and has been
probably strengthened somewhat
by the addition of Morris, who was
incligible last year. If he continues
at his present pace, he should
make short work of the memory.

Presbyterian Host To Cats At Clinton Tonight

Sigma Chi's, Phi Delts Lead Way
For Season's First Victory Intertraternity Race Gets Up Steam |

By BILL SLEDGE

The season's first victory and a chance to spoil Presbyterian
College’s Homecoming are the incentives Coach Bill Dole’s Wild-
cats have to put all they’ve got into tonight’s game with the
Blue Hose at Clinton, South Carolina.

By JOHN HANDLEY

The _interfraternity —_ football
league saw the early season scram-
ble to stay on top narrow down
this week leaving but one team
each in the first and second po-
sitions. The fast-movi Sigma
Chi's had to go for tw overtime
periods before a long Tyler Berry
pass was completed to Buzzy Holt
for the only overtime score as the
Sigs downed the Betas 12-6. The
Sigs are the only undefeated team
left. in the league.

The Phi Delts came in with three
victories during the week to move
into second place. The following
games include only those played
through Wednesday. Neither of the

league leaders were in Thy aay’s
‘Action.

Sigma Chis 12; Betas 6

In the closest defensive tussle
of the season a beautifully executed
30-yard pass by Tyler Berry and
a fine catch and run by Buzzy
Holt brought the Sigs a 12-6 vic-
tory in two extra period. The
game was featured by fine defen-
sive playing by both the Betas
and the Sigma Chis. Along with
Berry and Holt, Perrin Anderson
showed up well for the undefeated

spot as well as handling the chores
at safety on defense. Davidson's
record on pass defense only shows
how sharp Mr. Gray: and the
other boys have been back in that
secondary.

Then his chance came last
Saturday afernoon when Da-
vidson just couldn't get their
offense rolling and Coach Dole
called on another talent of
Johnny's. “He saw his duty and
done it’ and the first thing
observers on the sidelines and
in the stands knew, Davidson
had a TD and it was all be-
cause the men in the line
opened a slight hole and Gray
slipped through.

Tt was then very easy to run
right by three Red Jerseys and
then outrun them to the cross
stripes. All in all it was a neat 64.
yard run and that was not the end
of it. Although it did not result
in a tally for the losers, John took
off on the same play later in «the
game for about 15 yards and a
much needed first down at the
time.

In his nine times with the ball,
our Wildcat of the Week toted for
110 yards and an average of 12.3
yards per try for the leading ground
gainer award of the afternoon.

Man of Few Words

If you would ask Johnny Gray
about his football ability, he would
probably give you a “no comment”
not being rude, but just being
Johnny. For he is about the most
unassuming guy on the campus
and about as cool.on the playing
field as the proverbial Eskimo.

When Davidson gets its machin.
ery in gear for the Friday night
fray with the Blue Hose of Presby-
terian, you can bet Johnny Gray
will be a large cog in the moving
parts. His abilities are many and
his dependability is jgops.

Sigs. Hugh Gramley and Yancey
Robinson led the Bota forces in
the close thriller.

Phi Delts 7; KA’s 6

In winning their third victory of
the week the Phi Delts gained two
honors. They climbed into second
place in the league and beat last
year's champion KA‘s. Don Lazen-
by, along with Dan Leach, sparked
the Phi Delts to their 7-6 triumph.
Playmaker T. W. Aldred and Lefty
Vance .looked good in defeat for
the KA’s.

Kappa Sigs 22; Pikas 19

A good defense and an alert
offense spelled victory for the Kap-
pa Sigs as they nosed out the Pikas
in a close contest. “Lip’’ Lippard
and Rob Hoover sparked the Kap-
pa Sig attack. Little backfield ace
Jimmy Smith along with Bob
Owens showed up well as the
Pikas dropped their first game.

Ray Lilly and Dick Babington

combined to spark the SAE's to
their first victory of the campaign

As

as they took the measure of the
ATO’s by a 13-6 count. Leading

The Phi Delts showed fine scor-
ing punch as they downed the cel-
lar-dwelling Campus Clubbers 33-6.

a lot of their reserved strength.
