LATIMER CALLS

Change is the order of. the day everywhere, or
so it seems. Most certainly Davidson College has not
been left out.

After some thousand or more trips to Charlotte
on a rolling U.S. 21, a good number of blind dates
with Southern Belles whom all the girls on the hall
really liked, and at least two dozen Cop Linker park-
ing tickets, I find myself graduating from a school
unlike the one I applied to. Hopefully it is a better
school making me lucky for once in my life.

In the future I espy an archives building where
the library now stands. Many people would say the
present library wouldn’t have to be altered that much
for the archive building to become a reality, but I
see several documents added from the past few years
occupying a good amount of space.

Besides the obvious choices of the Blue Sky Com-
mittee Report, the Gentlemen's Code of Responsibility,
and the Religious Preference Treaty, there will be
thick volumes, tied of course, of the Dean’s Office
Decrees and iung list of various committees.

Certain members of the Class of ’69 had a good
deal to do with the various changes that took place

during our tenure.

I always thought the Class of ’69 would add
something significant but the alterations which suc-
ceeded during our matriculation have exceeded even
the furthest of my expections.

_. Most assuredly, the Class of ’69, the last of the
old guard Davidson establishment, will not die. It
will sort of pass out.

When I entered Davidson in the fall of 1965, the
school was somewhat different from what it is to-

day. Besides taking from 14 to 18 course hours in
the two-semester program, we attended class six
days a week, chapel three times a week, and either
Vespers or Church each Sunday.

Classes on Saturday cut into our social life quite
a bit. Even with the tremendous social opportunities
that the Davidson-Cornelius Mooresville area offers,
the situation that exists now is much healthier.

With a good number of chapels, we received our
share of bad speakers.

I remember singing hymns before programs which
featured such orators as a gentleman who presented
the hard sell job on why the Piedmont area was the
best place to settle after college. He had more pictures,
graphs, and visual aids than the ROTC department
used all year long.

Ministers and other men of God spoke with regu-
larity, possibly trying to stave off the inevitable abol-
ishment of compulsory Vespers.

Although some of the doomed Vespers programs
were good. many lulled the already fatigued students
to sleep. “Sunday Night at the Movies” now accom-
plishes the same task. .

palace and the press box on top of the football sta-

2 More Negroes

Two negro students dut of
the {1 accepted by the David-
son Admissions Committee
plan to enroll in Davidsoa
College next fall.

They are Reggie Kennedy.
from North Mecklenburg
High School outside of Char-
lotte. and Odell Kerns from
Lincotn High School in Spart-
anburg, S. C.

There were 37 original ap-
plications for admission by
Negro students. but 12 of
these students never com-
pleted their application
forms, according to James
W. Hyder, Jr., assistant di-
rector of admissions. ;

Of the remaining 25, 11
were accepted by the Ad-
missions Committee. -

This year the Davidson
Office has sought to recruit
more Negro students into the
Davidson student body, a:
cording to Hyder.

Commenting on why they
could not get more qualified
applicants to Davidson. Hy-
der said: ‘Most people don’t
realize that you can talk
about getting 100 Negroes in
the school. but getting them
is another matter. If you find
a good Negro applicant
there are usually about 15
schools after him. That gives
us a 15-to-one shot to get
him.”

“I don't think it’s fair to
say that some of these ap-
plicants didn't come _ to
Davidson for any particular
reason. They simply chose
another school. Sotne of thesé
guys had some great offers
of scholarships,” he said.

Hyder pointed out some of
the schools which the ac-
cepted Negro applicants plan
to attend, including Harvard.

Columbia, Emory and Duke.

“Also some of the guys who
we didn't get were basketball
players. and they can't be
considered as regular appli-
cants.”’ he said. ;

Hyder said that Davidson's
efforts to attract qualified
Négro students were begin-
ning to make headway. He
said that there seem to be
more qualified Negro stu-
dents coming up in the
Charlotte schools which
Davidson was now trying to
recruit. .

“Also, we're going to send
a letter out to al! North Caro-
lina schools telling them that
we're making an extensive
effort to recruit Negroes.
We'll ask them to send a
list of names of svcir quali-
fied juniors and sophomores
in their schools.” he said.

dium, there haven't been that many structures raised
on our metropolitan campus.

_ , The difference between then and now is on the
inside, so to speak. I see that next year, students
may be allowed phones in their rooms.

As freshmen, we had to fight over one or two
phones for the whole dorm. New heds and light fix-
tures have been added to replace the folding metal
mouse traps we slept in and snake-like mass of ex-
tension cords we were forever tripping on.

You still get scalded badly in the shower when
someone flushes the john anywhere in the dorm, but
I guess you can’t have everything.

The complete renovation of Chambers changed
the scholastic atmosphere somewhat. The day they
installed heat in the Dome room always held a warm
place in my heart not to mention other places.

Seminar rooms with long mahogany tables re-
placed the “circle maneuver” we used to practice,
and professors now have offices that look respectable
and not like dungeon cells.

Potential For Aggression
Analyzed By Phi Society

By JOE SMITH
Staff Writer

The dangers of the modern
world are forcing men to
take a new look at their
potential for agression, ac-
cording to German Professor
Thomas Pinkerton in an ad-
dress to the Philanthropic
Literary Society Monday
night entitled “An Emotional
Revolution.”

According to Pinkerton, his-
tory can be regarded as a
struggle between men at-
tempting to achieve full self-
expression and their  so-
cieties’ effort to place limits
on drives.

He mentioned the Greek
conception of the dual na-
ture of man. the Appollonian
and the Dionysian, as an ex-
ample of the realization of
this conflict. He also noted
examples of this conflict in
the writings of Goethe. Hesse
and Brecht.

Pinkerton maintains. that
the tremendous problems
which face man in this era,

among them the presence of
atomic power and the in-
crease in urbanization. de-
mand that man channel his
drive to self-expression 10-
ward constructive ends.

Bill Gill, Lanny Ackiss,

Pickens, Beecher Wood and

into the society following the

Freshman Camp

Altered Next Fall

By MARK HODGES
News Editor

“AL that we're really do
ing different in this year’s
freshman camp is trying
to combine orientation and
freshman camp.”” said Mac
Davis. one of the directors
of next fall's freshman camp.

Davis said that an at
tempt is being made. to coin-
bine orientation and fresh-
man camp to avoid much of
the useless repetition which
has occurred in past orienta-
tions.

“Everything that was in
the camp before will still
be kept in the program.
The only thing really dif
ferent is thatthe new curri-
culum will be explained to
the incoming students at
camp by Dean Johnston,” he
said.

The camp wiil begin on
Thursday and extend until
Saturday: two and a_ half
days of the orientation
program between freshman
camp and the beginning of
classes will be dropped.

When the students return
to the Davidson campus
on Saturday morning. they
will immediately begin con-
ferences with their faculty
advisors to plan their course
schedules for the school year.

As in past years, the camp
will give the incoming fresh-
man an opportunity: to meet
éach other and student aca
demic leaders in an informal
atmosphere. Professors froin
each academic department
will be at the camp one day
to answer questions about
academics at Davidson.

The featured speaker at
this year’s camp will be Dr.
Don Wardlaw. Professor of
Homiletics at Columbia The-
ological Seminary. Wardlaw,
who was at the camp last
year will deliver two informa!
talks to the freshmen.

no decisjon would have affect-

However, Johnston did in

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY

By vove of the students, Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Lyman
Parrigan was named winner of the Alpha Phi Omega “Ugly
Man” contest this week. The project was undertaken by APO
to raise money for a local scouting group. Parrigan edged
out Sigma Nu‘’s Dean Cromartie for the title, as the two
fraternities raised over $30 of the $60 contributed as votes.
APO President Tim Bynum said that the $60 will be added to
the $90 raised in the APO book exchange to send some scouts
fo summer camp. (Photo by George Sproul).

SLC Advises Mediation
In Cooks Wage Dispute

The Student Life Commit.
tee recommended last Fri-
day that the college admin-
istration work more closely
with Davidson fraternities to
work out the current dispute
over fraternity cook salaries.

The text of the SLC Reso
lution said: *‘We recommend
that the college administra-
tion work with the fraternity
cooks, fraternity officers, the
IFC and the Business Office
in order to develop satis-

factory ways of guaranteeing
that the cooks receive at least
a minimum wage and other
benefits comparable to those
enjoyed by the non-academic
employees of the college.”

In response to this resolu-
tion, a group of fraternity
cooks met with Robert J.
Stephenson, assistant busi-
Ness manager, and President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., Mon-
day night at the Davidson
Community Center to discuss

the issues involved in this
problem.

According to Randy Phil-
lips. chairman of the stu-
dent committee on fraternity
cooks’ salaries, some of the
cooks were hesitant to at-

tend the meeting.

“There was a real fear on
the: part of a lot of the cooks
that they would endanyer
