Three Seniors Are

Elected by I. R.C.

The following men were elected to
membership in the International Rela-
tions Club last Friday night: G. M. Ed-
dington, W. H. Allison, F. T. Franklin.

These men stand high not only in their
classes but also in the estimation of
their fellow students as is shown. by their
membership in many other honorary
organizations of the campus.

The topic for discussion Friday night
was “Greece,” and the principal talk on
this subject was given by Dr. Richard
Harding. He gave a most interesting and
instructive talk on his trip to Greece last
summer. giving particular attention to
the numerous objects of old Grecian
sculpture and architecture which he had
the good fortune to see. By means of
his wonderful flow of classical language,
Dr. Harding was enabled to give a very
fitting and beautiful description of .the
“Hernes” of Praxiteles which is now at

ture remains in almost perfect preserva-

the ruins at Olympia. It is one of the

the authentic work of one of the old
Greek masters. Dr. ‘Harding also gave

| will begin meeting here within the next
month. Furnishings will probably be sup-

arranged so that there will be no conflicting
|hours of meeting between the different or-
ganizations.
