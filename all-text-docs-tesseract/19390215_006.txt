make a team or two, we begin to
get the idea that we are really
somebody and such an idea is al-
ways disastrous as far as Christian
leadership is concerned. The pri-
Mary requisites for Christian lead-
ership are found in these verses:
“He that would be greatest of all
must become the servant of all,”
and “Only he that humbleth him-
self shall be exalted”. into posi-
tions of leadership
Who?

Who then can be Christian lead-
ers? According to Boggs God can
work through the ordinary man

provided that the individual is will-

ing to surrender his life to God.
God does His best work through
ordinary individuals such as you

and I provided we are willing to

let Him work through us.

As his closing point Boggs asked
the question “To what do we lead?”
It

that has here at
Davidson and in our Sunday schools

raised. The answer constitutes the
very center of our religion. Christ

up on the cross to draw all men
unto me must lead men to the foot
of the cross hefore they can have
their spiritual rebirth” through an
acceptance of the work that Christ
performed on it for them before
they can ever begin to live the
Christian life.

This poor reporter's assignment
was to get a feature story on the
charming songstresses of our re-
cent, great Midwinters. And from
the first, it really gave promise of
being a fine story.

From campus chatter it seemed
that everybody had the most exten-
sive and straightest dope any re-
porter ever hoped to write a story
from. There were tales, or shall we
call them rumors, for so they turn-
ed out to be, of crap games, of
big drafts of fiery fire water, of
fraternity favors, and of late, late,
Then we began to track
down and saw them turn into no-

New ‘Dope’

Miss was quite sick and that one

of the band boys seemed very dis-
turbed over her condition and that

she seemed very appreciative of

his attentions, which probably does

away with these rumors of late

dates. Especially, seeing they came
from very unreliable sources.

Now the one popular report: that

It is the exact way these tobaccos are com-
