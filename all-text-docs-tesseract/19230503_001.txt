RED AND BLACK DEBATERS WIN UNANIMOUS
DECISION OVER TRINITY COLLEGE INVADERS

Cox, Elkins and Hillhouse Present
Invincible Arguments.

MANY VISITORS PRESENT.,

Tax Exempt Securities Subject of
Strong and Heated Inter-
collegiate Debate.

After a long and gruelling forensic
battle and in face of the stiffest of oppo-
sition, the Davidson debating team, con-
sisting of L. D. Elkins, A. M. Hillhouse,
and W. M. Cox emerged triumphant by
a unanimous decision of the judges in the
inter-collegiate debate with Trinity last
Friday evening in Shearer Hall. The
query for debate, Resolved: That the ts-
suance of tax-exempt securities should
be forbidden by an amendment to the
Federal Constitution, with Davidson up-
holding the negative side, aroused the
keenest of attention in the large and ap-
preciative audience. Both teams showed
a great alertness of mind and a close fa-
miliarity with the intricacies of the issues
arising from the question, as well as an
ease and force in delivery of the argu-
ments, %

Dr. William J. Martin, President of the
college, presided over this debate, which
was the first ever held with Trinity Col-
lege. After the invocation by Dr. C. M:
Richards, he introduced the speakers in
their order; the contestants for Trinity
as H. C. Sprinkle, L. ‘B. Hollowell, and
E. B. Fisher, those speaking for David-
son being mentioned above. The judges
appointed for the debate were E. M.
Crouch, Superintendent of schools at
Mooresville, Hon. Paul C. Whitlock, of
Charlotte, and Maj. J. G. Baird, head of
Baird School in Charlotte. Music was
furnished by McCain’s Merry Melody
Men.

Martin the first speaker of the Affirma-

of the accomplishments of their unit, for

N OLD DOMINION

Trail of Blood Left Thru Virginia
By Bradley’s Squad.

DOUBLES TEAMS SHINE |

V.M. I. and W. & L. Defeated, and
V. P. I. Tied By Red and
Black Net Artists.

The Wildcat racqueteers returned
from an invasion of the Old Dominion
with two victories and a tie to their
credit. V. M. I. and Washington and
Lee tasted defeat, while V. P. I. won the
tie verdict. Without a doubt the strong-
est teams in Virginia were encountered,
and several exceptionally good players
gave the Wildcats plenty of opposition.
A summary of the three matches gives
Davidson only a slight advantage in the
single matches won, but a very decided
advantage in the doubles. Neither the
first nor second team in doubles lost a
match on the trip, dropping only two
sets out of the fourteen played. Hugh
Bradley not only held up his rep as cham-
pion of North and South Carolina, but
also made on irresistable bid for the
championship of Virginia. Twice, after
ha@ne ‘ost the first set Hugh showed
the old Davidson come-back and cap-
tured the match by taking the last two
sets.

The team, composed. of Hugh Bradley
(Capt.), Harry Price (Mgr.), T. F. Sta- -
ley, and MacBeall, left the hill for. their
victorious march through Virginia early
Monday morning, and arrived in Blacks-
burg just in time for supper, which last
was unfortunate for the V. P. I. cadets.
However, the cadets were good sports,
and accepted their cut down rations good-
naturedly and gave the visiting wielders
of the cat gut a roof-raising yell. The
following morning the four Davidson net
artists might have been seen inspecting
the spacious campus, modern buildings,
and student body with all the appear-
ances of General Pershing and his staff
