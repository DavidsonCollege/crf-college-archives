carried to the front of East Dor-

was to be burned.

Most of the freshman quaked
in East, visibly frightened by
the black robes of death. Only
a few ventured out into the
night to see a sight never before
beheld on the Davidson campus.
Marching to the mystic beat of
Hill Wellford’s musical can of
trash, the AGS moved in front
of Belk, carrying Chub Coving-
ton toward his death.

The upperclassmen began to
form a crowd.

A dignified silence was dis-
charged by the group into the
darkness as a member of the
AGS court explained the socie-
ty’s official definition of a-

According to a poll of the

would mean taking two days

the objections to this idea came

ters in Duke to make plots for
future activities.

First, the seven Gnome execu-
tioners, Larry Baucom, Hill
Wellford, Terry Holland, George
Little, Jocko Williams, Joe Gam-,
ble, and Kent Tucker announced
that officially that night, Oct. 7,
1963, the Alpha Chapter of
AGS was born. “We would like!
to see other schools adopt a
' “Piald chapter.” they stated. “Any
d interested schoo! can drop us a

card.” '

The seven explained that they
“Shad no officers in AGS, since
it was a truly democratic so-
ciety in which all were equal.
Then they proceeded to elect
officials for the Gnomes because
“we don’t think they’re capable

Representative, Capt. Pierce
(AGS does not think he deserves
the rank of Major). The society
refrained from branding any
freshmen as Gnomes. “It is the
hope of the AGS to deliver the
Freshman Class from Gnomism,”
said Little.

The society also gave an of
ficial definition of the type of

and are “girls that dress alike

all interested people, especially

the freshmen how to recognize
Gnomes so that they can throw

In connection with the type of

‘entertainment program for Mid-

Winters the IFC is taking a poll
of individual fraternity mem-

ferred. It has been suggested
that an informal dance be held
in the basement of Chambers
Building after an IFC concert.

When asked why Chambers
is being considered, (FC Presi-
dent Haynes Kelly replied
that the acoustics are better
there than in Johnston Gym-
nasium. “The basement of
Chambers is smaller,” he said,
“and the atmosphere is bet-
ter. A crowd draws more peo-

ple.”

At present the IFC plans to
take no action on the alleged
monopoly of combos and after-

senting fraternities need not
participate.

The IFC voted also to leave
the problem of “bull pledges”
bers to determine what is pre- in the hands of the faculty. At
the present time, the college
does not recognize as fraternity
members those students who had
formerly pledged a fraternity
but have failed to make the re-
quired C average during one of
the two semesters he is a pledge.

The plan, if approved, would
not go into effect until the
1964-65 school year, however.
The schedule for this year
cannot be changed.

The student body was about
evenly divided on the question
of holidays between semesters.
Some favored Saturday-Sunday-
Monday as holidays, and just a-
bout the same number favored
the present system of Sunday-
Monday-Tuesday.

In another query concerning
next year's schedule, the poll
found mostly negative opinion
on starting school on or before
Labor Day. Most of the com-
plaints were due to jobs, vaca-
tions and other personal plans
that would prevent many stud-
ents from returning before
Labor Day.

The problem of scheduling
Freshman Camp before Labor
Day was also brought up. In an-
other question addressed to the
freshmen who attended the pre-
orientation camp, approximately
60 per cent said they would still
have gone to the camp even if
it were held before Labor Day.

The calender itself is the
big problem in the schedule
since 1964 is leap year.

In other matters at its regular
meeting, the council approved
final plans for the election of
the editor of next year’s Wild.
cat Handbook. The election will
be held after chapel on Monday.
Freshmen will not be allowed to
vote.

Spratt told the council that
the idea for a summer reading
program was still being investi-

Debating Season
Opens At Tourney

The debating season ‘will go
into “full-swing’ this weekend
with the annual Davidson Col-
lege Debate Tournament. The
Davidson team will be in com-
petition with teams from 10
other schools,

The teams entered are David-
son, Carson-Newman, Duke Uni-
versity, Gardner-Webb, Lynch-
burg, Randolph-Macon, Univer-
sity of South Carolina, Univer-
sity of North Carolina, Wash-
ington and Lee, Western Caro-
lina and Wingate College.

The tournament will consist
of five rounds which began at
3 p.m. this afternoon. There will
be three rounds today and two
tomorrow morning. They will be
conducted in the educational
portion of the College Church,
and students are invited to. at-
tend if they enter before the
.beginning of each round.

A banquet was held in the
Morrison Room of the Union to-
night for the debaters. Tomor-
row an awards assembly will be
held in Hodson Hall at 11:30 a.m.
Davidson has intentionally dis-
qualified itself from the three
team trophies to be presented
but will be vying for the three
individual trophies.

The proposition to be debated
is the national query, “Resolved
that the Federal Government
should guarantee an opportunity
for higher education to all quali-
fied high schoo! graduates.”

Davidson students debating
or assisting in administrative
duties connected with the tour-
nament are: Bill Brown, Bil!

‘The third idea is that a stud-
ént would receive no grades on
any work, but that*the profes-
. sor-counselor with the group
would make periodic checks to
make sure a student was doing
acceptable work. The student
would then receive a grade of
“passed” or “failed” on such
work. For all courses passed, he
would receive one quality point
per hour at Davidson, but that
would not count on his scholas-
tie average.

The proposed plan lists sev-
eral advantages in Davidson's
having its own program:

“Students are ‘immersed’ in
foreign situations, studying and
living as students in that. uni-
versity; American relationship
is only in one conference each
week with the Davidson profes-
sor and in meeting of seminar,”
the plan states.

“The weekly conferences with
the Davidson professor-in-resi-
dence will assure better control
and evaluation of the student's
work.

“The foreign language pro-
fessors of Davidson will con-
tinue their own education and

Embry pointed out that lan-
guage professors would rotate
in traveling with groups. Due to
the interest in both French and
German, programs would be
carried on. in both countries at
the. same time. No sites abroad
for study have yet been select-
ed, although the committee has
several in mind. |

Embry said that both the
French and German  depart-
ments would welcome any stud-
ent suggestions as to how the
proposed plan could be improv-
ed. He urged all interested stud-
ents to put their names on the
list of prospects for study a-
