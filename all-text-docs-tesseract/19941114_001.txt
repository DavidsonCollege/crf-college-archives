502 panels of the nearly 30,000
panel AIDS Memorial Quilt
displayed on campus

By Mary Clare Jalonick

The gymnasium , became
quiet as volunteers, all clad in
white, filed out onto the floor.
Spectators watched as they formed
circles around parts of the Quilt
and slowly unfolded them. As
they revealed the panels, invited
visitors methodically read off the
names of some of those who have
died.

“Tt was an honor to unfold, as
aperson who has been touched by
AIDS,” says sophomore
Katherine Ross. “Being with other
people was nice.”

The NAMES Memorial Quilt
finally came to Davidson. For four
days, students, faculty, staff and
members of the greater commu-
nity viewed 248 panels of the
28,000 in existence around the
country. Over 250 people volun-
teered for jobs like quilt monitors,
merchandise vendors, and name
readers.

“Davidson needs [the quilt],
but it is only the first step,” says
Hal Dougherty, the education co-
chair for the NAMES Project at
Davidson.

The atmosphere in the gym-
nasium was quiet and somber.
Some had tears rolling down their
faces, while some stared at the
panels with a quiet respect. Par-
ents pointed things out to their

children, as some laid roses on
individual panels. .

Sara Beasley, a professor of
English, had seen the quilt twice
before and was excited when she
was asked to be co-chair of cer-
emonies for the exhibit. Also a
Davidson alumna, she says that
“Davidson is a place you can live

Committee
studies
future of
Johnston
Gym

By Courtauld McBryde

Acommittee composed of stu-
dents, faculty, administrators, and
headed by Dean of Students Tom
Shandley was asked by the Facili-
ties Planning Committee to look at
Johnston Gym and at what the
building has to offer.

The committee created a list
of 25 items which essentially sum-
marizes its discussions about pro-
gram ideas for the use of Johnston
Gym.

The list entails such ideas as
lounge space, cafe/coffeehouse,
women’s center, swimming pool,
sports cafe, mail boxes, bookstore,
aerobic/dance space, art gallery,
cultural center, and many more
suggestions,

Shandley says that the com-

mittee sent arecommendation back
to the Son Planning Commit-

we

oT ret STE new COL.
lege Union and presented them
with the list of program ideas.

The committee made the last
step, and now Shandley says the
issues are in “their laps.” They
will now decide whether these ideas
are feasible.

Shandley emphasizes that the
recommendation is “not an ap-
proved project yet, but it’s moving
in that direction.”

Dr. Ruth talks frankly about sex

By Ceci Combs

Dr. Ruth Westheimer was re-
ceived at Davidson College last
Wednesday evening with mixed
reactions from students. Perhaps
this had something to do with pre-
conceived notions — those stu-
dents who thought Dr. Ruth was
visiting our campus to magically
make their sex lives better (or exis-
tent) were probably a bit disap-
pointed. But those who were inter-
ested in hearing an intersesting and
informative talk on sexuality from
a psycho-sexual therapist’s per-
spective spent their two dollars
well.

Dr. Ruth’s lecture dealt more
with sexuality in general than with
the specifics of sexual intercourse.
She let us know from the begin-
ning of her talk that she considered
herself “rather old-fashioned anda

square”, and that while she was
here to discuss with us one. aspect
of relationships, by no means was
sex the only important facet of a
relationship. It came as a pleasant
suprise for most that “the sex lady”
placed so much emphasis on the
importance of love and commit-
ment in conjunction with sexual
intercourse. Dr. Ruth told the
Davidson audience thatshe wanted
to help them with “sexual literacy”,
and advocated the importance of a
healthy attitude toward sex.

This is not to say that those
anticipating an explicit sexual lec-
ture were denied this — Dr.
Westheimer prefaced her talk by
saying she was not sure if the walls
of Love Auditorium had ever heard
the type of language she was going
to use. She covered a variety of
topics, from unplanned pregnan-

cies to AIDS to the Graftenberg
spot, and did not spare any detail.
She shared her hope that talks like
hers would help reduce problems
like unwanted pregnancies and
sexually transmitted diseases by
educating the public. “I’m really
glad she came to Davidson,” says
Sarah Orsbon, head of our cam-
pus’ Women’s Issues Committee.
“She brought up some important
issues in a healthy and informed
way, and even if you didn’t agree
with her perspective, her talk cer-
tainly made you think.”

And judging from the amount
of formal and informal discussion
following the two hour lecture,
Dr. Ruth Westheimer did just that.
Orsbon’s committee contributed
one-fouth of their annual budget to
