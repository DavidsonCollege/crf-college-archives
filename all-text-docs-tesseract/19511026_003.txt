I read an in-
teresting article in The
Rotarian, official maga-
zine of that civic club,
which would be quite
alarming to you gam-
blers and point special-
ists on football games.
: It was ‘‘Don't Bet on
; Football’’ and was writ-
ten by Norman L. Sper,
who is one of the coun-
try’s best and well-
7 known sports writers
and _ predictors. He
stated that he had spent

~ all his life going around
By DIOK LILES the country gathering
up information on football from coaches, players, or from just
observing or statistical research. He had a lifetime average on
predictions of about .750 per cent, which is good for any sort
of batting average.

Why is it that he warns against betting? Because
‘of the numerous things that influence teams and coaches
that are never known by the average bettor. He men-
tioned several instances that proved that ‘comparative
scores’ predictions are all wet. We all know this from
the very numerous times unusual outcomes have come
about between teams that were completely ‘‘settled™ on
the parlay cards. But we also can't stand to pass up a
“*sure’’ bet when the points are good,

“UPSETS ARE DOWNFALLS FOR SHARPIES”

Sper mentioned how upsets were produced from alumni
pressure, unusual spurts of fight in the team, coach's grudges,
rumblings of the press, and student pep. How about last Satur-
day’s big upset on the Pacific Coast. 1 can just imagine (with
some knowledge of the past situation) that the Trojans of
Southern Cal were sparked on to victory from a cqmbined pres-
sure by the student body which was used to winning football
until the last couple of years, and by their coach who is in a
“win or else” position, since the students control the job and
were becoming uneasy again. That was not taken into con-
sideration by ‘Pappy’ Waldorf and his Golden Bears of Cali-
fornia who were resting in the No. | spot in the country and
had 38 league wins under their belt.

One of the most interesting sections of this article,
was the story of how a little Georgia Tech team rose
up and defeated the dreadnaughts of Centre College in
the days when Bo McMillan had the little college on
top. It seems the team was traveling back from a game
with Pitt and another miserable defeat, and Tech's
coach was in the club car ‘consoling’ himself when a
young fellow started a conversation with him, The boy
asked if the man liked football, to which the caach,
tired of the thought of the game, answered that he
was a traveling salesman and knew nathing abqut
football,

Somewhat egging the boy on at times, he learned that he
was Centre's subquarterback and was going home to his sick
mother. Before he got off the train, he had ‘explained’ football
to Techs coach and in the meantime had given away evety play
he knew. When Georgia Tech beat the powerful] Centre team
the next week 39-0, the boys didn't understand how their
coach had ‘‘scouted"” them so well. ‘

SANDRA WINS BIG ONE

You can't help mentioning the ‘‘Great Game'’—the only
game in the last few years, Davidsons upset victory over State
in 1949. Several factors were important in the win. I¢ was the
last year of playing together for a number of bays who had
come down here from high school in Virginia, we had always
fought State with all our might. the students were behind the
tcam 100 per cent, but in my own opinion, a pretty pinkish.
warm, and brand-new little baby girl was the deciding factor.
I may be completely out of my head, but Buddy Chandler and
the boys on that team will back me up I’m sure.

The game was rocking along with Davidson ahead, but
precariously so. Then at’ the halftime period, it was announced
that a baby girl had been born to Sandy Carnegie, one of the
outstanding linemen on the team. From then on it was for
“Sandy's little girl,” and when little Jake Wade hauled in a
pass in the closing minutes and dashed for pay dirt, and a win,
ic was all for a little girl, and the baokies had not known
anything about this aspect of the upset.

Potent Generals
3 TD Favorites

By DICK ROPER

‘Name a player,’’ said Coach Crowell Little. “Any player.
Two to one he’s hurt.”’

That's the situation that prevails again this week as the
Wildcats invade the home grounds of Washington and Lee’s
defending Southern champions. Davidson will go into the con-

test at Lexington the underdogs by at least three touchdowns.

Although many of Little’s squad
are still on the injured list, quar-
terback Jack Ruth, who sat out
last week’s 25-6 loss to Richmond,
should be available for tomorrow's
encounter. Center Arnold Whis-
nant, out for several weeks with a
bad knee, should be back in the
starting linenp to strengthen the
offensive line,

“The team is in good spirits con-
sidering our losses,” Little said
yesterday. “We have set up some
special defenses for the game ‘and
hope we can curtail their strong
running attack to some extent.”

The greatest threat the pow-
erful Generals boast is razor-
sharp passer Gill Bocetti, who
was instrumental in defeating

performances this season in a
bid for All-Southern honors,

With the Wildcat backficld still
in poor physical shapo, Coach Lit-
tle has been doing some fancy
juggling in order to field a com-
bination with a scoring punch, The
backfield will line up tomorrow
with Ruth at the signal-calling
post, Ham Wade at right half,
Jimmy Thacker at left half, and
Henry Brown at fullback. Leroy
Fargason, sidelined for the past
two weeks with an ankle injury,
should also see some duty at the
power slot.

Brightest spot in the Cat back-
field again last week was freshman
Jimmy Thacker, whose hard, slash-
ing running has already won him

Jerry Kiser turned in another
excellent performance at his
defensive guard post against
the Spiders. Little called the
rotund Shelby, N. C. lineman
“Our best defensive lineman all
year.”

The Richmond fiascb was the
last game of the current season in
which the Wildcats are rated even.
After W&L. come VMI,
State, and Georgia Tech. But the
tattered Cats are far from ready
to throw in the towel on any of
these contests, Though they will
be anywhere from three to six
touchdown underdogs against these
remaining foes, Littles’ ‘team is set-
ting their sights on at least one
of their remaining contests.

KA, KS, Pi Kapp
Out Front In Race

Staving off a last minute scoring
bid by a determined Pika Club,
Kappa Sigma yesterday moved into
a three-way tie with Kappa Alpha
and Pi Kappa Phi in the interfra-
ternity tag football teague.

‘The previously unbeaten KA’s
were knocked off earlier in the week
to give them a 5-1 record, and the
Pi Kapps won a playoff dilly with
the Phi Delts, after the regular
time contest had ended in a tie.

Undoubtedly the best game the
season has produced was the battle
between the Phi Delts and the Pi
Kapps. After many near scores and
goal line stands, the game. ended
in a 7-7 deadlock, This bears out
the fact, that although the newly
adopted tax football is played with
loose rules, it certainly is not a
wild scoring ame as everyone had
predicted before, tle season had be-

Baird's Loopsters Work,

Prospects Looking Bright

By BOB

As the gridiron wars near com-
pletion, all eyes are beginning to
turn towards another season of
basketball. In early practice ses-
sions Coach Boyd Baird's charges
have made it. clear that they are
out to improve on last year’s rec-
ord of seven victories in twenty-
six starts, Approximately fifty-five
boys reported for early practices,
about. thirty-five of these were
freshnren; however, Coach Baird
has cut the squad to about thirty-
seven at present and will have to
cut it cven further before the open-
ine ghume on December 4, with the
utighty Wolfpack of N. C. State
College.

Some of the lettermen returning
from last year's squad are Bill
Brooks. who. finished the past sea-
sow with the top average of 13.2

‘poms per game and is captain of

this ‘verr's-aquad: Mac McLean, T.
C, Coleman, Al Fitzgerald, Bob
Turk, Don Lazenby, Joe Dudley,
Jim Smith and J. V. Howell. In
addition, several fast improving
players, including 6-7" George
Melton, are expected up from the

OWENS

frosh ranks of last year. Coach
Baird has also indicated that there
are séveral outstanding freshmen
who will undoubtedly see a lot of
action this season,

The absence of Tommy Haller,
who set a new Davidson scoring
record fot a single game of 31
points last séason, and Fred Henge-
veld, who was honored by being
named second string All-State by
the Charlotte Observer. and played
with the Southern Conference
Senior All-Stars im the post-season
game against N. C. State, will be
sorely tnissed. Bob Graham and
Bilt -Proctor, bath of whom were
counted upon for heavy service this
season, failed to re-enter school.

Great spirit and = deétermination
has been displayed ‘hy the team,
and the prospects are. looking up.
With team-captain Bill Brooks ex:
pected to put forth his best year,
all indications are that a much-
better season in in btore for the
Davidsonians here in Wildcat Hol-

low.

versity of Richmond last Monday
19-43, Davidson College’s cross-
country team runs up against the

record inyonly a little over a week.
The * fleét-footed Senior from
Winston-Salem covered the dis- .
tance xin 23:31, eclipsing ‘a mark
set the week before by Munger of
William and = Mary. Last week,
ayainst North Carolina, Tom estab-
lished a new record at the local
course with a time of 21:30. This
clocking upset the mark also -set
