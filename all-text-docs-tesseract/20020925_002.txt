from Vamanos, page 1

Davidson Town Police Chief John Kearin
said Tuesday the Vamanos Van program is not
set up as a privately run program, and that he
wasn’t aware of alcohol ever being brought on
board.

“We’re not naive to the fact that college
students will have beer. We don’t condone
underage drinking, but we also don’t pretend it
doesn’t happen,” he said.

Kearin declined to discuss the specifics of the
citations.

Dean of Students Tom Shandley said he was
“surprised and disappointed” by Saturday’s in-
cident, and was not aware of any similar occa-
sions on. which alcohol had been brought on
board.

He said the Vamanos Van operates on a
volunteer basis, and thus is subject to the same
laws as any other ve-
hicle.

“This is notacom-
mercial van,” said
Shandley. “It’s acol-
lege motor vehicle.
What happened this
weekend should’ve
never happened.
(The van] is sup-
posed to be a safe
and reliable service.”

It’s unlikely the students will be charged with
Code of Responsibility violations, since the
incident occurred off campus, Shandley said.

But the van will remain parked until'the SGA
devises a new policy that strictly prohibits alco-

hol on board. Shandley hopes to have the van
running again as soon as possible, perhaps by
this weekend.

Epps said he and SGA President Gray
Patterson are already working on a new plan
that will require alcohol containers to be kept
closed and stored at the front of the bus. ’

“Our new policy will guarantee that there is
no reason for the police to pull over the
Vamanos Van,” said Epps. “Future drivers
should not be concerned about that problem.”

One-administrator said SGA members in-
volved with the program had previously been

_ warned not to allow alcohol on board.

“From time to time, there’s been debris left
on the bus like beer cans,” said Director of
Public Safety Sam McKelvey. “We’ve talked
to the drivers and emphasized that you can’t
allow open containers on the bus. They all
seemed clear about that.”

Epps said Saturday’s incident began after he

students finished
dinner at RJ Gator’s,

a restaurant and bar

located just off I-77

in Cornelius. Two

students left the res-
taurant with alcohol,
‘and were instructed
by a hostess to get
rid of it before
boarding the bus.

It’s not clear whether the students complied,
but Wayland Denton, a manager at RJ Gator’s,
said the manager on duty decided to alert the
police to prevent the restaurant from being held
liable for the alcohol on board.

“They were told, ‘Do not leave with an open
container of alcohol.’ They kept right on walk-
ing. We could be held liable for letting them
leave. We can’t afford to lose our liquor li-
cense,” he said.

But the van returned to campus without inci-
dent, and wasn’t pulled over until after a new
group of students had
boarded it roughly 30
minutes later. Those
students, which in-

Two Davidson Town Police officers boarded
the bus around 10:35 p.m. and discovered the
cooler of beer. They checked IDs and conducted
breathalizet tests before issuing citations to six
of the students.

Ironically, said Epps, the incident at RJ
Gator’ s—and the resulting 91 1 call made by the
manager— led to alcohol citations for several
students who weren’t at the bar.

“The police saw the underage drinking and
thought that’s what RJ Gator’s had called
about,” said Epps.

At least one student was ordered to appear in
court after receiving citations for underage con-
sumption and possession of an open container.
The student, an 18-year-old freshman, said he
was never informed that alcohol was not al-
lowed on the van.

SGA member on Monday, says it’s the first time
the van has been out of service since its incep-
tion in 1997.

“We’ve had small incidents, windows get-
ting broken and things like that,” he said. “But °
for the most part, it’s been a perfect system.
People love it.”

Epps says he hopes the program has not been
tarnished by Saturday’s events.

“Saturday night was a single incident that
should not cast a dark cloud over the program,”
he said. “Although there were people on the bus
drinking, the driver was sober, and he kept 20
intoxicated people off the road. I’d rather the
police pull over the Vamanos Van than pull
over 20 Davidson students and give them DUIs.

Although I graduate in May, I would ask for
the SGA not to let this program die. You get
more out of it than you put in.”

9:30 p.m.

Washington returns to RJ
Gators’ to pick up the students after
they finished dinner. As they walk
toward the van, a restaurant hostess
stops two students allegedly
carrying open alcohol containers,

and tells them to get rid of the
alcohol before boarding the
bus. Epps says the students
complied. Washington says one
student got rid of a beer can, while
the other carried an empty mug onto
the bus.

9:35 p.m.

A restaurant manager dials
911 to alert police there may
be alcohol on the van. The

why is science possible at all? And why do we
do science?

Polkinghorne argued that such contempla-
tions exist because of our consciousness, a
result of billions of years of cosmic and biologi-
cal evolutionary processes. His speech asked
whether such consciousness exists by chance or
by creation, and he upheld his belief in creation
throughout his lecture in statements that were
both rational and faithful.

On Wednesday, Polkinghorne will detail his
insights about Christianity in “A Physicist’s
Approach to Christian Belief.”

Following the lecture, Polkinghorne will join
interested students ina fireside chat on the third
floor of the Alvarez Student Union. .

Polkinghorne earned his B.A.,M.A., Ph.D. in
quantum field theory, and D.Sc. for research on

The van arrives back to
campus and drops off

students at various

points, including the
Union and senior
apartments.

10:35 p.m.
A Davidson Town Police
officer stops the van on
Griffith Street near the CVS
pharmacy. According to
Epps, the officer spots an
open cooler of beer and asks
if anyone was drinking.
Several students raise their
hands.

10:30 p.m.

Epps and a group of
eight to 10 students call
Washington to summon the
van again. Some students
board the bus with a cooler
of beer.

The van departs from
outside the Kappa Sigma
house for a concert at South
End Brewery on Exit 28.

Midnight

The van returns to campus
for the night, without going to
South End Brewery.

10:40 to 11:45 p.m.

Two officers begin taking students off the
bus to check their IDs and conduct breath-
a-lizer tests.

They begin writing citations. Students -
under age 21 are cited for underage
consumption of alcohol on a moving
vehicle, while those over 21. receive
citations for having open containers on a
vehicle. Some of the citations carry $115
fines.

One freshman who asked not to be

. identified was cited for both possession of

an open container on a moving vehicle
and underage possession of alcohol. The
