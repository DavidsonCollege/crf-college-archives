Davidson Honored by Vis-
it of the General
Assembly

300 Commissioners and Many Visiting
Ladies Arrived by Special Train

Saturday afternoon the General
Assembly left its sessions in Char-
lotte long enough to pay a two-
hours’ visit to Davidson. Punch was
served at an informal reception on
the campus as soon as the visitors
arrived.

Then the greater part of the vis-
‘itors walked around the campus and
heard from the lips of students and
faculty various bits of “local color,”
saw the picture of the “Greatest Da-
vidsonian” painted on the front of
Chambers, above the columns by a
former student; saw the new gym-
nasium and the athletic field from
which the Wildcat machines go
forth to “win for the honor of old
Davidson ;” saw the chandelier in
the Philanthropic Society hall un-
der which Napoleon married Jose-
phine Beauharnais; saw the inscru-
table grandeur of the columns
of Chambers; saw the beauty
of the grass and heard about the
famous rains that make it so green;
saw the dormitories in which the
boys live and the classrooms in
which they meet their doom by the
deathly hail sprayed from the deadly
machine guns of the faculty.

After this the commissioners re-
assembled on the campus and upon
hearing the unearthly strains of the
Wildcat quartet (no, gentle reader,
the name is not onomatopoetic—and
they were not trying to imitate the
salutations with: which a hound
greets the full moon).

Then Dr. Martin, with his usual
pithy forcefulness welcomed the vis-
itors. Dr. Lingle, President of the
Board of Trustees of the college,
spoke of the bright hopes which the
college has for the future. Six col-
ored ministers, who were commis-
sioners in the Assembly, sang sev-
eral negro songs. Dr. Moore, who

Commencement Events Interesting and Enjoyable

Class of ’20 and Y. M. C. Commencement, Season is|Degrees Conferred Upon

A. Hear World Famous
Minister, Dr. John
McNeill

The present graduating class at
Davidson College had the privilege
on last Sunday of hearing one of the
most unique, interesting and uplift-
ing Baccalaureate Sermons that has
been preached to any class here dur-
ing the past several years. ‘The ser-
mon was preached by Dr. John Mac-
Neill, pastor-elect of one of the
large churches of New York City,
and at present from Birmingham,
Ala. Dr. MacNeill is a native
Scotchman, and is widely known
both in the old country and in Amer-
ica for his wonderful ministry and
his scholarly attainments.

The text for the sermon was
chosen from Luke, the 57th through
the 62nd verses of the ninth chap-
ter. The subject was: “The Great
Commencement Offered to the
Three Types of Men Represented in
the Text,” namely: First, the man
who is too quick, too talkative con-
cerning his religion ; second, the man
who is too slow, ashamed or afraid
to be open with his religion; and
third, the man who is too soft to be
a true Christian, unable and unwil-
ling to bear the wrench required to
free him from the world and for
Jesus. In a very clear and able
manner the speaker developed his
text, and gave his hearers such a
sermon as they had seldom, if ever,
heard.

Dr. MacNeill made his second ap-
pearance before a Davidson audience
in preaching the Annual Sermon be-
fore the Y. M.C. A. The subject of
the evening’s discourse was: “Con-
stancy in Adherence to One’s Relig-
ious and Scriptural Beliefs and Prac-
tices,” and Daniel 6:10 was used as
a text. The importance of having a
true religious creed was emphasized
and the necessity for strict adher-
ence to its principles shown. Sev-
eral phrases used by Dr. MacNeill
will give the central thought of the
sermon:

Davidson Finals Brought to Close
With Awards—Distinguished Pres-

ident of Wofford College Scores
in Annual Literary Address

Men of one mind describes those
who heard the excellent addres by
President H. N. Synoder, of Wofford
College, who spoke before the grad-
uating class of Davidson College,
Tuesday night. His subject may be
best expressed in his own rhetorical
question: “How are we minded?”

Introduced by Dr. Martin as from
a sister state, of a sister denomina-
tion but not in person a sister, but
a man in the truest sense, the dis-
tinguished president of the Meth-
odist college of South Carolina fully
sustained his reputation as a think-
er and a‘speaker in the message
he brought to Davidson. While his
address was in serious vein and an
earnest call to sober thought as to
whither as a nation we are drifting,
its somber, shadow side was so re-
lived by pleasing humor and bright
illustrative story and incident that
the impression made was altogether

ne.

How shall one take the measure
of the greatness of aman? His true
greatness is not found in his tall
statue, not in his stalwart frame; it
is measured by the distance between
his eyebrows and his hair and as
the line of this latter recedes it is to
be assumed that the individual con-
cerned steadily increases in this
greatness, .

Charles Lamb wittily remarked
that any man could write a poem
like Wordsworth’s own if only

he!

Promptly at 1 o’clock Wednes-
day morning a long procession of
black robed Seniors left the Philan-
thropic Hall and filed slowly and
majestically up the broad walk to
Chambers and into the Commence-

cises began.

The invocation was pronounced by
Rev. C. M. Boyd, of Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
followed by the salutatory, deliv-
ered by the second honor man, S.
Horton Askew, in which a cordial
welcome was extended to the vis-

itors in the hall.

The four representatives of the
class who were to contest the Se-
nior Orator’s Medal then spoke. H.
B. Brown, of the Eumenean Society,
led with an address on “Patriotism.”
Another Eumenean, P. B. Carwile,
followed with a discussion of “In-
finity.” D. M. Chalmers, and Coyte

Hunter, of the Philanthropic So-

ciety, spoke next on “Choosing a
Purpose” and “A Paramount Prob-

lem in Reconstruction.”

The Bachelor of Arts Degrees
were then conferred by Dr. T. L.
Lingle, and the Bachelor of Science
Degrees by Dr. H. B. Arbuckle. The
diplomas were presented to the
young men by the President, Dr.

. J. Martin. Prof. A. Currie then
awarded the Master of Arts De-

ees to Messrs. Good, Hall and

iske. These diplomas were also
presented by the President.

The President next conferred four
honorary degrees. Mr. B. W. Kil-

Mr. R. M. Miller Heads Alumni for
Fifth Term. Alumni Pledge Sup-
port to Davidsonian and
Athletic Association

The annual banquet of the Alumni
Association was held in the gym-
nasium last Wednesday evening at 6
o’clock sharp. Mr. R. M. Miller,
Jr., President of the association, in
a few but well chosen words wel-
comed the class of 1920 into the
large body of alumni of Davidson
College. Mr. Miller said that unless
the alumni is loyal there is some-
thing wrong either with the alumni
or with the college. Since the alum-
ni of Davidson College are loyal,
there is therefore nothing wrong
with Davidson nor the alumni. He
told the new men that they would
find that as the years rolled by they
were becoming more closely drawn
to the college traditions and the
principles for which she stood.

T. H. Spence, on behalf of the
class of '20, responded to Mr. Mil-
ler’s welcome in a very fitting man-
ner. Spence said that the class of
’20 was glad to become a member of
that large body of men known as
Davidson alumni—that they had
been glad to be Davidson students,
but still gladder to become alumni,
and that he felt sure that ’20 would
take its place among the leaders in
advancing the cause of the college
they all loved.

President Miller then made his
annual report as presiden, among
other things in the report he spoke
of the local organization of the
alumni in Charlotte having over 100
members and the splendid work that
they were planning to do for the col-
lege. He also mentioned the thriv-
ing association of Gaston county, of
which Mr. S. A. Robinson is presi-
dent. President Miller stated that
Davidson was now living in a new
era. “With all its new endowment
and with all the spirit, zeal and en-
thusiasm Davidson will double its
enrollment within a few years,” con-
cluded Mr. Miller.

The class of ’15 was then heard
from _ by its representative, Mr. F.
W. Price. Mr. Price said that it
was a great pleasure to be back on
the hill and to see so many of his
old friends and to meet the many
new ones. To meet with this great
body of loyal alumni and pledge and
reconsecrate our service to the cause
of Davidson College is indeed to me
a great privilege, said Mr. Price.
The present is great of the past and
full of the future.

Nineteen Ten was reported by Dr.
White, of Atlanta, Ga. He spoke of
the good organization among the
Davidson alumni there and told of
the great success the members of
"10 were meeting with in the busi-
ness world and other walks of life.

Dr. Clark, of Salisbury, spoke for
the class of '95. Dr. Clark said that
the day had come for Davidson to
grow, she could no longer content ~
herself with the hundreds, but she
must think in terms of thousands for
her student body. “We now have
amended thé constitution of the col-
lege so we can take on $10,000,000
(ten millions) assets, why not dig
down and put that much in our col-
lege,” concluded Dr. Clark.

Dr. Harding was the only member
