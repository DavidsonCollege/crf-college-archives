THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

A Freshman Plans, Schemes,

Celebrates (7) First Frolics

April is the month of show-
ers, flowers, and the birds and
the bees. At this time of year,
signs of the Davidson gentle-
man's primitive instincts, pre-
carlously subdued since spring
break, come bursting out all
over. And so Davidson College,
acquiescing to the mounting or-
ganic rumblings of the. student
body. schedules Spring Frolics
to permit a brief excursion into
the mysterious world of these
birds and bees.

Since Spring Frolics is cer-
tainly no ordinary weekend the
freshman splurges and invites
his best girl from back home.
The chance to practice all the
cool lines, approaches, and

_O

tricks which he has learned in
three greuling months of pledge
training has finally arrived.

About two weeks in advance,
he begins preparations by mak-
ing a trip to the nearest ABC
store—in Charlotte or Moores-
ville—with an older fraternity
brother.

He spends the final week ob-
serving the coolest upperclass-
men and putting the final
touches on his technique. Al-
ready the frosh imagines him-
self as the classic hero James
Bond, casually sweeping the rav-
en-haired beauty off her trem:
bling toes. He is ready to con-
quer the world in one glorious
weekend.

His first disillusionment
comes Friday afternoon when
his date arrives grinning broad-
ly and sporting ten new pounds
which she did not need. They
hug hello and spend the after-
noon getting reacquainted and
readjusted. She: “Did you hear
about Susie dropping out of
school?" “He: “No kidding.”
He: “Did you .know tnat Sam
may get drafted?" She: ‘Gee,
that’s awful."

At the concert they relax.
She is relieved—for two whole
hours she will not have to carry
the burden of a conversation. He
is relieved—for two whole hours
he will not have to act inter-

ested.

After the concert, there is the
long walk from Chambers to
the fraternity house. Awkward-

ly out of tune with the roman. :
tic glow of soft moonlight and ©

glittering stars around them,

they hold hands and try to act ;

natural, But the clasped hands
cannot bridge the barrier.

At the after party the here-
tofore tee-totaling freshman has
betrayed himself by asking for

a bourbon and whisky. The 1
native ¥°”

freshman begins his
dance; as the drinks take ef-
fect, the gyrations grow wilder.

Then, hot and sweaty, he
belts down a couple more drinks
and takes his girl outside for a
walk.

Every fraternity member
feels compelled to add his own
chapter to that ‘unwritten mas-
terpiece The Amorous Adven-
tures of a Davidson Gentleman.
And what better opportunity
than this? She is ‘‘out of it.”
and he is ‘in’ just enough to
know where to go and what to
do.

Unfortunately, some quickly

discover that the girls are not

quite as “‘out of it’ as they had
calculated: their ciumsy ad-
vances are countered with a
sharp rebuke. The more sub-
tle. however, are more success
ful; but freshmen, gentlemen
that they are. naively obey whon
she half-heartedly coos. ‘‘Dav
id, stop.”’

On Siinday morning the fresh.
man doesn’t remember how he
got back to the dorm, but he
manages to roll off his mattress
and take his girl to church.

As he stares into the mirror
with his bloodshot eyes. he real-
izes what a fool he was to get
up so early.

In church he is shocked be-
cause. he feels no compulsion to
beat his breast in penance. She
sit motionless, bleary eyed, ruf-
fled, and looking much the worse
for wear. Somehow they make
it through the day- no ques:
tions asked.

The. time to leave. Mixed emo.
tions. She does not want to go
back and does not want to stay.
He wants to go to bed. Unbe-
lievably they have had what is
called a good time. And may.
be a few have fallen in love for
the first time. Maybe. After all,
April is the cruelest month.

_ _ He blinked his sleepy eyes then yawned, show-
ing a glimpse of a green tongue that the long win-
ters sleep had kept hidden like a miser’s first half-
eagle.

Slowly he began to rise, stretched oaken arms
that were becoming fuzzy green with spring, stagger-
ed to his mirror, a clear poo! of April rainwater, and
splattered dogwood blossoms behind his ears.

Davidson College was coming alive. And though
they said he was dead gray sky and barren black
limbs forever, again he showed them they were
wrong as crystal blue and golden green cut across
a winter world without color. The cynics were
wrong again.

You remember his waking. woman? Remem-
You came and saw him, little girl.

I wonder. does he remember you?

Does he laugh when he remembers how you
came to celebrate his victory over blackness with
red. dancing and throbbing music?

Does he smile when he remembers how you
left your world of perfumed petticoats to stamp an-
other boy’s image on your travel bag, to add an-
other notch to your spiked heels?

Does he grin—like the toothless, fat. bald man
who sells 10-year-olds filth from behind funny book
stands—when he remembers watching you mouth ‘I
love you’s’ and surrender a part of yourself so you
could conquer your future doctor and be secure in
the hold your lie had given you over him?

Does he chuckle with you as he remembers your
cleverness when you hid loneliness, the frightened
awareness you. needed to be needed, you wanted to
be wanted, behind self assured laughter, loudness
and shrieks of ecstacy?

Remembering, does he find humor in the secret

ber?

DANCING BEHIND LOCKED DOORS

Spring Frolics '66 will be an
event far-removed from comparable
celebrations of 1901, 1925, or even
1953 when dancing was prohibited on
campus and drinking was prohibited
everywhere.

Frolics has painfully emerged
from “Junior Speaking,” a creation
of the 1890's that served as a front
for the Spring’s most important social
event.

Since no dancing was allowed on
campus during the 1920-30’s (it was
both illegal and a sin to dance on
campus until 1945), fraternities held
dances off campus in exotic locales
like Concord, Mooresville and Char-
lotte (things really haven’t changed
much).

NO DRINKING PROBLEM
No real “drinking problem” ex-
isted at this time because Davidson

was attended only by Gentlemen, but
the admissions committee did make a
few errors, and a small minority did
drink, but Dr. Chalmers Davidson,
professor of history, stated that one
drank at his own risk.

The drinking rule during this pe-
riod did not allow drinking on or off
campus—even in a_student’s own
home, and Student Council officers
were honor bound to enforce this rule
against all who were seen consuming
the foul brew.

Dr. Davidson said that he can re-
member hiding his roommate who
was drinking at a fraternity party
from the president of the Student
Council, (the Betas have always been
campus leaders, as history proves.)

Although student council mem-
bers were honor bound to report
drinking violations, dancing on cam-

pus was not a violation of the student
body regulations (only the faculty saw
it as a sin). Dr. Davidson said he can
remember dancing at the fraternity
houses with the doors locked and the
shades drawn.

But the faculty was not com-
pletely governed by backward indiv-
uals during the late '30’s. In 1938 it
ruled that “square dancing” was not
dancing but a “folk game,” so might
be indulged in on campus.

In 1944 under the leadership of
President John R. Cunningham (‘Slick
John” to most people), the Trustees
accepted the faculty’s recommendation
that the students be permitted to hold
their dances on campus.

CAMPUS DANCING

Since on-campus dancing was no
longer a sin, the first dance took place
on February 9, 1945, at the Alumni
Gymnasium (now the College Union),
and from that day onward, dancing
on the campus of Davidson College
has been legal.

But what happened to the “‘drink-
ing problem” while dancing emerged
out of sin into righteousness? Dur-
ing the '40’s the fraternity parties
became rather “raunchy,” according to
Dr: Davidson, and since student coun-
cil members were honor bound to re-
port drinking violations, and frater-
nity presidents were forced to testi-
fy (there was no 5th Amendment),
these students did not attend their
own fraternity parties to avoid be-
ing forced to report their more for-
tunate friends.

But this problem was solved dur-
ing the reign of Dean Samuel R. Spen-
cer. The dean ruled that student
council members were. not honor
bound to report drinking violations at
fraternity parties, but bound only to
enforce the “gentlemanly conduct”
clause. This action was undoubtedly
to do away with the “raunchiness” at
the fraternity parties.

But Dean Spencer moved on to
bigger and better things and Dean
John Bailey soon reversed the situa-
tion. Student council members and
fraternity presidents were again put
on the line.

NORTHERN CLOUD

Then a huge dark cloud out of the
north began rolling into the Davidson
College community. This is the dark
cloud of “Student Agitation” which

is still with us (its last appearance be-
ing the ill-fated vespers “boycott’).
Such agitation resulted in a rute
change to allow drinking off-campus.

But as an example to how strict-
ly the drinking rule off campus had
been enforced, the son of the president
of a.nearby college who was attending
Davidson in the early 50's was shipped
home from school for having con-
sumed a beer in Greensboro.

As already stated (many words
back), Spring Frolics evolved from
Junior Speaking. The first Frolics was
held on April 26 and 27, 1946, and
consisted of a Formal Dance on Fri-
day night (R.S.V.P., no less) and a
semi-formal on Saturday night. Both
dances were held in Johnston Gym.

FORMAL TRADITION

The tradition of a formal on Fri-
day and a semi-formal on Saturday
lasted until! 1959 when the Frolics’
dances consisted of a semi-formal on
Friday and casual wear on Saturday.
By 1961 both dances had degenerat-
ed to informal, and now there aren’t
even any dances.

The highlight of the dances dur-
ing the early ’50’s was the “Figure”
which was the grand march of all of
the fraternity presidents and their
dates. For a few years, a Queen of
the Dance was elected by a faculty
committee, but “since all the girls
cried, not only the losers but the
winner also, this event was abolished,”
Dr. Davidson stated.

During the early ’50s, when hoop
skirts were “in,” a freakish event
happened. The scene was the “Figure”
at a Spring Frolics’ dance in Johnston
Gym. There were no lights except
for a globe hanging irom the ceiling
of the gym and a light behind the band
stand which sillouetted the couples.

When the third couple met at the
top of the bandstand to march down,
the date, wearing a rather thin hoop
skirt, and sillouetted by the light shin-
ing from behind, appeared complete-
ly naked before the Frolics’ crowd.
Needless to say, faculty members cor-
rected the problem.

The history of Spring Frolics of
Davidson has been a long and colorful
one. We've moved from “Junior
Speaking” to rock ’n’ roll singers and
from ‘folk games” to after parties.
Spring Frolics is obviously far differ-
ent than it was 40 years ago. Wonder
what it'll be like in the year 2000?
