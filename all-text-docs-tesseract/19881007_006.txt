Fragments of Heaviness

On Selwyn street sun drenched in rain,
Domed at dusk in yesterday's dream,
Gordian twined, I turned
Light-lorn in heavy cords of hope.
This is the role of heaviness:
To dredge up fossil fish
On bending chains.
From bottomless pools
Thick skin; time crusted-
Heaviness heaves its silent power,
Brooding out of wet millenia.

Things blotted leave no mere murmurs.

No muffled whispers echo in memory’s charnal house;
But Bacon's mouths triply crucified on Tate’s walls
Bloated round in screams and teeth,

Their tongues severed and wriggling.

The history of my people contains that we would defecate in the avenues
staring the passerby in the eye. Can I count the number of times.a
long step saved me from disturbing one of these humble creations?

{ grew up out of a pile of feces and the smell of urine on hot sidewalks. .

_ Mating dogs were my neighbors. :

I was led into the valley of the shadow of death and there I found the lamb

rotting ruthlessly!

Let the English woman beat me for insulting her queen. Let the American pass

‘by for ours is a culture of terror. ty

I will go to the gurgling child when the sulfureous smell does cause the

throat to wretch.
