Sunday, but since Clemson has
nine scholarship players, Mayes
said, ‘‘Davidson played with
them the entire game and I was
elated!”’

Both offense and defense
played well. The loss came as a

result of a breakaway and a shot
on goal so the Cats were not
disappointed with their runner-
up finish.

The Cats are seeded first in
regional competition and will
play High Point at High Point
Friday ‘in the regional semi-
finals. The Cats have beaten
High Point in the past and a
repeat victory would put them
in the regional finals. —.

Beating High Point would

the regional finals.

Mayes said _ in general she
is ‘extremely proud ' of the way
we have improved and handled
ourselves under pressure. The
team has contributed as a whole
throughout the season and we

are ready for Regionals.”’

Soccer team makes final
bid for winning season

“The soccer team, now 8-8, has

one consolation in its play of
late—it’s playing consistently.
Providing, of course, that one
defines consistency as dropping
four of every five games a team
plays. The team dropped its last
two games to USC-Spartanburg

Sinclair paces Cats to victory against Guilford, 33-20

Behind a workhorse effort on
the part of fullback Ray Sin-
clair, Davidson bulled its way
to a 33-20 football victory over
Guilford Saturday, raising its
season record to 5-3. Sinclair
rushed for 187 yards on 27
carries and scored three touch-
downs to pace the Wildcats over
the Quakers, who doomed their
own cause with fumbles and

penalties.
Neither team put together a

particularly artistic effort as the

officials stepped off 180 total
penalty yards. The Quakers lost

two fumbles and an interception -

while ’Cat quarterback Brian
Whitmire gave up two inter-
ceptions. The ‘‘bottom line’
Setumiey was the strength of

the ’Cat rushing attack and the
Quaker’s lack of it. Davidson
simply controlled the line of

scrimmage.

The ’Cats struck first in the
opening quarter when Whitmire
found half-back Mickey Dillon
for an 11 yard score, The

The teams traded scores in
the third quarter; Sinclair pick-

picked off a Whitmire pass deep
