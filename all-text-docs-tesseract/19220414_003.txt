FRANK P. MILLER EXPLAINS
DUTIES OF C. E. SECRETARY

Monday evening at 7:15, in Shearer
Hall, Mr. Frank P. Wilson, field secre-
tary of the States of North Carolina, Vir-
ginia, and Tennessee, spoke to the Chris-
tian Endeavor Training Class on the dif-
ficulties of a field secretary and the
means to be used in overcoming them.

He ‘said that the principal obstacles
that a field secretary has to overcome is
the indifference of Church people of the
power of the Christian: Endeavor to
train young people of any denomination
for future work in their Church and
community.

At 8 o'clock he spoke in the Church
to the members of the Senior Endeavor.

He brought out the many things that
_ aC. E, Society could accomplish if well-
organized and wide-awake, such as pris-
on work and civic betterment and the
organizing and carrying-on of classes in
personal evangelism. He brought out
several concrete examples of ideal soci-
cties and the work they are doing along
these lines.

He also mentioned the State C. E. Con-
vention that is to be held in Charlotte
on June 16, 17, and 18,

DOCTOR THOMPSON TELLS OF
HIS EXPERIENCE IN BRAZIL;

Dr. Thompson, Southern Presbyterian
missionary to Brazil, gave an -interesting
talk last Friday night in Dr. McConnell’s
history room, He has been working for
30 years to the south of the Amazon val-
ley jungles, among a people of mainly
Portugese descent, and it was with
reference to that people that he spoke.
'The territory, half as large as the United
States, is sparely settled, the people liv-
ings in widely separated villages mainly
along the waterways. The negroes, who
were brought over as slaves before they
were introduced in the United States,
were freed in 1886. They now. held many
important offices both in business and
government There has been much
intermarrying among them and now the
culy destinction between the so-called
white—even if he is-as black as pitch—
and a negro, is whether he has kinky
hair or not. The natives are an exceed-
ingly polite people and would do nearly
anything for the good of the missionary.
He spoke of the need of agricultural
1itissionaries, showing how the Brazilians
planted their grains, not by plowing the
soil first, but by the primitive method
of digging rows of holes in hard soil for
the seeds.

Dr. Thompson, together with his evan-
gelical work has been issuing two publi-
cations in Portugese, one a small Church
paper and the other a weekly bulletin
in which are published sermons and helps
on thg Sunday School lessons. This bul-
letin, highly complimented by our board,
finds its way with its 1,300 subscribers to
every missionary in Brazil and to many
of the native teachers and preachers.

After having worked in Brazil for 30
years, it no longer seems a foreign field
to him, but home, and he can scarcely
wait until fall to get back and work as
long: as his body, which he says is “still
tough,” shall last, he said.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS IN
CONFERENCE AT BELMONT

The Southern District Convention of
the North Carolina Christian Endeavor
Union met Saturday and Sunday in the
Presbyterian Church of Belmont. The
peak of the attendance was reached
Sunday- when over 100 delegates were
present.

Dr. Fraser, of Queens College, and Sec-
retary Wilson, of the State Union, were
among the prominent speakers who
helped to make a success of this con-
vention. Dr. Fraser preached at the reg-
ular morning service and that night ad-
dressed the Endeavorers with his char-
acteristic earnestness and force. The
Convention theme was “Four-Square”
and the text was contained in II Tim-
cthy.2:15. Mr. Wilson was a live wire

at all the meetings, doing many things to

promote the usefulness of this conven-
tion to each attendant.

The Davidson College Christian
Endéavor Training Class and the David-
son Church Endeavor were both well
represented. Fraser, Gamble, Guiton,
and Purdy lead in thé Sunday after-
noon program while that night Misses
Nina Holt and Gene Martin, both of
Davidson, added attractiveness to the
service with a specially selected and well
rendered duet.

A-simple yet sincere and forceful
“model” prayer meeting was conducted
by Arnett Gamble on the closing day.
This feature was of real practical value
to all.

T. A. Guiton, of Davidson College, was
clected district quiet hour and life work
recruiting superintendent, which was in-
deed an honor, The next meeting of
the Southern District will convene at
Huntersville and Davidson hopes to have
an equally strong delegation~ present.
Other delegates from Davidson were
Misses Johnsie Shelton and Ruth John-
son,

INTERESTING DEPUTATION
TO CROSSNORE HIGH SCHOOL

Dwight Chalmers enjoyed a visit to the
Crossnore High School, April 3 and 4.
The school is situated in Avery County,
N C.,, the village boasting a population of
33 The school, however, has an enroll-
nient of 205 pupils, who come from. all
over the county. In fact, three students
live so far distant that they have gone
intg housekeeping on their own account
in the neighborhood.

The management of the school is in
the hands of Mrs. Mary Martin Sloop,
a sister of Dr. Martin and Mrs. Archi-
bald Currie, of Davidson. The school is
maintained by a systematic collection
and sale of old clothes. The amount of
the sale last year was $10,000.

The occasion for Dwight’s trip was
the commencement exercises. The Sen-
icrs held classday April 3d, presenting a
play Monday night called “Safety First.”
At the graduating exercises Dwight gave
a talk on “The Value of An Education.”
Following his talk, the boys of the Sen-
ior class gave a luncheon in his honor.

The eagnerness and enthusiasm of the
pupils to get an education is evident be-
cause of the trouble and hard work that
most of them go through to obtain it.
Practically every member’ is helped in
some way by the management.

FRIENDSHIP DISCUSSED AT
VOLUNTEER BAND MEETING

The subject of the Volunteer Band
meeting on last Sunday morning was
“Friendship.” J. P. Price led the meet-
ing and brought out several phases of
interest about friendship.

The meeting opened with song and
prayers by Ted Jones and Ray Carr.
After some business had been disposed
of by Bitzer, definitions were called for
from different members of the “Band,
definitions of friendship. Two definitions
of special interest were suggested: “A
friend is one that knows all about you
and likes you just the same;” and “A
friend is one who will tell you to your
face what he won't tell you behind your
back.”

The duties and privileges of friendship
were then discussed. The leader’brought
out four duties of friendship that cover-
ed the ground well. First, he said that
a friend should be loyal.
tion of Bo McMillan’s letting a guard, a
friend, carry across the last touchdown
in the last game of the season when he
was racing with a West Virginia: man
for total number of points for the sea-
son in the South. Second, a friend
should have confidence in his pal. Third,

F man should idealize his friend. An
‘illustration was here used of a mission-
|ary who idealized a poor Chinese boy,
}sew his possibilities, and gave him the
opportunity. And today that boy is one
of the leading men religiously and polit-
ically in China. Fourth, and most im-
portant, friends should be friends to-
gether and co-friends with Christ. This
will keep friendship pure, rich, and
worth-while.

The meeting closed with a short series
of sentence prayers by members of the
band.
