tistics: Rucker had 6 assists and

Committee formed

3 steals, Himes had 11 re-

the nets with 40 points. Jeff
McKinnon came in next with
23, and Raymond Lawson
chippedin 12. Bob Stevens was
a defensive force with. 5
blocked shots.

In the first regular season
game of the season Davidson

defeated Erskine 93-67.

“Rucker ‘and’ Himes were the
only double-digit scorers for

Davidson, but they had a field
day; Rucker scored 36 and
Himes 30. Dean Keener dished
out 8 assists, Rucker had five
steals,--and Maurice Gray
blocked 2 shots. —

For Erskine, Chip Schener
scored 15 points, Weyling
White scored 13, Marcus Scott
10, and Porcher 10. Porcher
also effected 5 steals.

Search is on for new chaplain

By TRIPP HELMS
A search committee has
been formed to replace former
-Chaplain~ Charlie Summers,
who resigned in September.
The members of the com-
mittee are: Dean Will Terry,
Professors L.R. King and Max
Polley, students Sheldon Gar-
mon ’90, Doug Hicks *90, and
Sarah Merritt °89, and
Davidson College Presbyterian
Church (DCPC) representative
Jane Avinger. The committee
met for the second time Mon-
day to finalize the list of expec-
tations for the postion.
Among these expectations
are that the Chaplain “presenta
vibrant witness to the Christian
faith on campus,” “be apastoral
resource for the students,” and
“create a public forum for wor-
ship and the discussion of issues
facing the community of faith.”
In keeping with the College’s
new emphasis on service, he or
she will serve as advisor to the
Y Student Service Corps.
An expectation important to
the faculty is that the Chaplain

Inside

“serve both studentsand faculty
by conducting seminars and
retreats relating faith and learn-
ing,” says Dean Terry. Thenew
Chaplain will not be a member
of the faculty but is expected to
“cooperate with the Depart-
ment of Religion in its educa-
tional'role in the college.”

-. Affiliation with DCPC will

~ beareinstated role for the chap-

lain. Chaplains who served
before Summers were associate
ministers with the church, but
this affiliation was discontin-
ued when he came to Davidson.

' The new chaplain will be a

“pastoral associate” at DCPC.
Although this position will not
make the chaplain “answer-
able” to the church, he or she
will have certain responsibli-
ties including “teaching aclass,

participating regularly in wor-

ship, and serving as an adviser
to the Westminster Fellow-
ship.”

A Masters of Divinity de-
gree isrequired for the position.
“A Ph.D. would be a plus,”

according to Terry, “but other —

things such as the candidate’s
style, qualities, energy, and
ability to relate to the students
and faculty are’ more impor-
tant.”

The committee is now es-

tablishing a list of candidates

for the position. Some candi-
dates have called and expressed
an interest, and others have
been recommended by semi-
nary presidents and other indi-
viduals,

There is no official time- .

table for the search, but Terry
hopes to have a new chaplain
hired by the end of winter term
or the beginning of spring term.
When the committee reviews
all of the candidates, they will
make a recommendation to
President Kuykendall who has
the final say in the hiring deci-
sion.

Dean ‘Terry said that com-
mittee members are not theonly

people involved in the search

and approval process. More
students and faculty members
will be consulted before the rec-
—— is made.

Dean of Students Will Terry
and a committee of faculty
members and students have
announced Davidson’s nomi-
nees for the 1987-88 Thomas J.
Watson Fellowship Program.
David Ethridge, Clara Broniec,
Reed Herrero, and Helen Bow-
man have been chosen to com-
pete for the prestigious Watson
Fellowships, grants worth
about $11,000, which are
awarded to 75 graduating sen-
iors each year.

Davidson is one of fifty col-

~ leges and universities nominat-

ing candidates to the Watson
Foundation, which has awarded
1,305 grants since 1968. The
program itself is described as
one which “enables students of
unusual promise to engage in a
year of independent study and
travel abroad,” and attempts to
provide a “time in which
[graduates] might explore with
thoroughness a particular inter-

est. . . and develop a more

informed sense of international
concern.” -
study must involve a specific
project in a field which the stu-
dent chooses, and cannot in-
volve extended study at a uni-
versity or in the U.S. alone.

~The independent —

Watson nominees selected

In order to win a nomination
from Davidson’s Watson Se-
lection Committee, applicants
had to make an oral presenta-
tion of their proposed projects
and endure two interviews with
the committee. The “final four”
then sent the Watson Founda-
tion acopy of their proposals for
a review. Proposals generally:
include an outline of. the

~~ student’s plans for utilizing the

grant money and a statement of
his reasons for wanting to
undertake this project. Accord-
ing to Foundation literature, the
project “should be one which
may be pursued with great inde-
pendence and adaptability. .
.[it] should be personally sig-
nificant, imaginative, and fea-_
sible.”

The trustees of the Wan
Foundation judge the applica-
tions in terms of the students’

integrity, intelligence, leader-

ship, and potential in their re-
spective fields. They also con-
sider the applicants’ academic
records and extracurricular ac-

~ tivities which relate to their

fields of interest. A representa-

tive then interviews each candi-
