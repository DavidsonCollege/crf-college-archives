Last week, the Patterson Court
Council (PCC) elected anew presi-
dent, John Cowan, who will work
with both the Court and the Ad-
ministration to try to create a better
social life for Davidson students.

Cowan waselected PCC Presi-
dent by the Council consisting of
the presidents of each fraternity
and eating house. Cowan previ-
ously served on the council “be-
cause all of the presidents of the
various houses asked me to be a
member,” and says he was not sur-
prised in being elected.

“I had expressed interest in
the position and was approached
by the former president [Steve
Shames], who encouraged me to
run.” As president, Cowan’s goal
is to “organize and unify the Court,
as well as the community.”

Currently the Council is de-
veloping a Judicial Board to deal
with problems that occur on the
Court. The Council also created a
Strategic Planning Committee,
which Cowan says will “look at

other schools and see how they
deal with problems such as alcohol
policies.”

Cowan also hopes to improve
relations between the community
and the Court, as well as with inde-
pendent students. The PCC is try-
ing to create aCommunity Service
Committee which would coordi-
nate service activities that the en-

“tire Court could participate in.

Independents will also have
more control over the social life of
the Court, as two independent stu-
dents will be members of the Coun-
cil for the first time. Cowan says
that “the Court is more well
rounded. We’re not pro-anything.
I feel we have a very objective
view on the social life at Davidson.”

Although Cowan realizes that
his hopes may fall short of what
happens in reality, he sees the PCC
as a vehicle to establishing a
“healthy social life at Davidson,
which is especially important be-
cause of the stressful academic
schedule that Davidson students
endure.” «

Sociology and Spanish majors work together to help low-income Hispanic families

By Brooke BAGWELL

This semester an internship is
being offered between Davidson’s
Spanish, Sociology, and Medical
Humanities departments with the
Cabarus Family Residence. Pro-
gram in Concord. The internship is
headed by Dr. David Adams, Re-
search Director at the Residence
Program and a consulting associ-
ate in the department of commu-
nity and family medicine at Duke
University.

Adams, currently a visiting
assistant professor at Davidson in
the Medical Humanities depart-
ment, has developed the internship
centering around a field of study
and analysis of health care in low
income Hispanic areas of Char-
lotte.

Under the direction of Adams,
the interns investigate the condi-
tions of Hispanic communities,
most of whomare living in trailers.

Most of the communities con-
sist of 30 to 40 trailers with an
average of five to six people living
in each. The residents are mainly
young families who immigrated to
the United States from Mexico and
Central America and have ended
upin North Carolina seeking work.

Social workers are concerned about
their ability to adequately find and
receive health care, for most know
little English.

The 12 Davidson students and
six University of North Carolina at
Charlotte students that participate
in the study meet every Sunday at
the designated site of study. They
then organize into groups of two,
interview and observe the inhabit-
ants. The interviews are done in
Spanish by one group member
while the other observes the sur-
roundings. ats

As an interviewer, Steve
Albert says that the internship pro-

vides an excellent opportunity “to
develop Spanish and conversa-
tional skills.”

The interns are responsible for
conducting an extensive question-
naire which will provide them with
a broad range of information con-
cerning the area’s living condi-
tions and the trailer community’s
physical and societal needs.

The main focus, however,
deals with health issues and the
relative accessibility of health care
to the Spanish-speaking commu-
nity.

Assistant Lori Leymour, Adams
acts as a medical sociologist, su-
pervising the students. Adams col-
lects medical data such as samples
of blood sugar levels through ran-
dom glucose screenings, checks
on resident blood pressure, and
dental conditions.

At the end of the afternoon,
the group returns to the Cabarus'
Hospital, where the residency pro-
gram is based, to record and ana-
lyze data. Adams then instigates a
lecture discussion on health, medi-
cal issues, tropical medicine, and
its relevancy to the Hispanic im-
migrants.

“The hope is that the data we
collect can be used to instigate
some sort of primary care initia-
tive for the people in this and simi-
lar areas,” he says.

Overall, junior Sociology ma-
jor Kathryn Harker, a participant
in the program, says, “The pro-
gram is a great hands-on experi-
ence that provides an important
and in-depth view of aneeded com-
munity service.”
