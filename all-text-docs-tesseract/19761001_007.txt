the davidsonian

play with the feeling and emphasis of
a single jazz soloist.

In addition, Henderson uses the old
West African pattern of call-and-re-
sponse, setting off one section against
another—rolling saxes versus crisp
brass.

Finally, Vol. II,.Side Two, contains

oo the most notable song of the concert,

Sing, Sing, Sing. Written in a minor
key and featuring Gene Krupa on
drums, it is simply the best recording
of the best song in Goodman’s books.

The crowd applauds loudly as they
recognize the familiar ‘‘jungle drum”’
tom-tom-tomming of Krupa, and the
song, twelve minutes in its entirety,
gets under way. Another burst of
applause comes at the point where the
78 rpm commercial recording would
have ended, but Krupa keeps on
drumming and the band continues.

art jazz collection —

The Fletcher Henderson song,
Christopher Columbus appears, but
the melody is hardly recognizable and
in a minor key. Babe Russin takes a
solo on tenor sax, as the piano and

trumpets back him up with some
choice background work. Harry
James plays the next solo, his best
during the concert. Throughout, he
shows tremendously nimble fingering
and demonstrates his excellent
range; his normally syrupy, oppres-
sive vibrato is pleasingly toned down.
Next is Goodman, and his’ solo
demonstrates the full range of his
talents; clearly he is the best jazz
clarinetist ever.

After the applause dies down,
Krupa cuts way down on dynamics
and Jess Stacey commences with
some of the most original piano
playing of the evening. Haunting and
beautiful in a minor key, it is
wonderful contrast to the previous
wide-open, ‘‘killer diller’”’ solos.

Then comes the finale, with Krupa
opening up, the trumpets screaming,
and Goodman, barely audible, high
above the entire band.

Historically, the Benny Goodman

Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert provides a
valuable insight into the development
of the jazz idiom in the late 1930’s,
when the spontaneity and excitement
of a live performance was captured on
records all too infrequently. Alto-
gether, the concert ranks among the
best jazz works ever recorded, and is a
must for the library of any serious
jazz buff, however far removed his
tastes may be from ‘‘that refined
Dixieland which is Swing.”’

She is open every day from 11 am until 9 pm,
except on Saturdays and Sundays when she
opens at 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm, respectively.

The other ‘‘homemade’”’ emporium is in
Concord and is called the Cabarrus Creamery.
The Creamery’s set-up is a bit more commer-
cial than Spoon’s, but the ice cream, though
not full of Mrs. Spoon’s T.L.C.., is still made in
the back and is still quite good.

These folks have about 25 flavors of ice
cream to offer, plus a wide assortment of
banana splits, huge sundaes, and the like.
Their specialty, however, in most folks’
opinions, is their peanut butter milkshake, a
concoction which sounds revolting at first but
which is, in this reporter’s opinion, magnifi-
que. Not too sweet, the shake has a touch of

salt which, along with the peanut bits (they
use crunchy peanut butter), makes for a truly
unique dessert experience.

Now for the hard part —getting there. First,
go to Concord on NC 78; turn left on the

~four-lane road where 73 dead-ends, cross the

bridge and take the first right by a car lot.
Drive for about a mile and a half, past
Hardee’s and the neon, past the graveyard,
and on your right across from Troutman’s
BBQ will be the Creamery, a rather
’40-ish-looking green building most likely with
a number of cars out front. Hours are 8 am to 9
pm on weekdays and 8 am to 10 pm Saturdays

and Sundays.

In Charlotte, in Eastland Mall, is an
establishment which, if you’ve ever visited,
you either love or hate: it’s called Farrell’s,
and it specializes in atmosphere (‘‘Fun’’, ‘‘a
good time’’, etc.) and, to a lesser degree, ice
cream.

Ice cream dressed up, ice cream on cake,
great, heaping mounds of several flavors of ice
cream in tubs are on the menu, as well as

burgers and the like. The ice cream is good but §

expensive, and the Farrell’s visit should really
be reserved for a hall get-together or the like
rather than for hard-core ice cream eating. It’s
a iot of fun if you’re in the mood, though, and
it’s worth-a visit if you’re in Charlotte.

Also in Charlotte are four Baskin-Robbins,
four Mayberry’s, a Dipper Dan, two Howard
Johnson’s, et. al., scattered about here and
there. If you’re desperate there is also a
Mayberry’s on I-77 in a mall just this side of
Statesville.

If you’re in your dorm and without long-ride
transportation, the 7-11 has Sealtest and
Breyer’s in half-gallons, and if you’re really
desperate, Dairy Queen and Bantam Chef have
that soft-serve substitute I mentioned earlier.
By all means, though, save that stuff for hard
times, ’cause you can sure do a lot better if
you're willing.
