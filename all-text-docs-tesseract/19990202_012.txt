Bela Fleck & the
Flecktones coming

to Love Auditorium
this Friday

By Kirk WILLINGHAM
Staff Writer

On Friday night, February 5, Bela Fleck & the
Flecktones will bring their jazz/fusion/pop/cos-
mic/bluegrass act to amaze and astound all that are
lucky enough to get a ticket to the 8:00 show in
Love Auditorium.

It’s usually difficult to categorize the genre
of a particular musical group, and the Flecktones
are no exception to that rule. This is especially
apparent inthe
fact that they
holdthe record
for being
nominated for
Grammy
Awards in the
most catego-
ries. Over the
band’s

_ten-year ca-
reer, they have
been nomi-
nated for eight
Grammys (in-
cluding two
this year). The
categories in
which the Re-
cording Acad-
emy has at-
tempted to de-

fine them are
pop, jazz,
bluegrass,

spoken word
and country. They won their only award in 1997
for the Best Pop Instrumental Performance
for’’Sinister Minister” off the “Live Art” album.=20

Besides the numerous Grammy nominations,
the Flecktones have also been honored with many
other awards, including Best Jazz Group by the
Playboy Reader’s Poll (thus why you might “See

' Belain Playboy”). Like any great bluegrass musi-
cian they have also contributed heavily to the
“success of many other artists, either in concert orin
the studio. They have toured with Phish, Dave
Matthews Band, Sam Bush and many others. Bela
has been featured in recordings by everyone from
the Dave Matthews Band (on “Before These
Crowded Streets”) to Garth Brooks (on his new

' live disc).

For most of the life of the band, it has ‘been
composed of the trio of Bela (pronounced BAY-
luh) Fleck, Victor Lemonte Wooten, and Vic’s
brother, Future Man. Throughout that time they
have always rotated in and out various other musi-
cians, although now it appears that they have
decided to keep the latest addition, Jeff Coffin, to
make it one crazy quartet. Each musician is a
master in his own right, so there is no weak link in
the group.

Bela Fleck plays a banjo that makes you want
to forget all preconceived notions of a hillbilly
sitting on his front porch picking (unless, of course,
they play their cover of the Beverly Hillbillies
theme song). He grew up in New York City, and
had a difficult time breaking into the music world
since his banjo was not as conventional as a guitar
or horn. However, his first big break came when
he joined the New Grass Revival in the early

eighties. Then he played shortly with the band .

Strength in Numbers (including Jerry Douglas
who performed here in November) before creating
the Flecktones. He has changed the way that
people look at the banjo and proved that a banjoist
can be respected outside of the country and blue-
grass realm. He was awarded the Best Miscella-
. neous instrument award by Jazziz and the
JazzTimes. If he keeps this up much longer, they
will be forced to create an individual category for

the banjo.
The base (no pun intended) of the “Tones

rhythm section is the Bass Player of the Year ~

(according to Bass Player Magazine), Victor
Lemonte Wooten. By the time he was eight years
old, he was honing his skills playing at the nearby
Busch Gardens theme park in Williamsburg, VA
and playing with his four brothers in The Wootens.
The things that Vic does on the bass are

indescribable and must be witnessed to believe.

Fortunately, for those who get there early enough,

you will get
to see up
close the
man thates-
teemed mu-
sic critic
Vv ioc
Garbarini
calls “the
Bach of the
bass.”
Victor’ s

brother’s
name _ is
Ro y
Wooten,
but he is
more affec-
tionately
known as
the Future
Man. The
reason why
he was
given this
name is be-
cause he brought the technology for his instru-
ment, the Synthaxe Drumitar, back from the fu-
ture. This one of akind instrument creates almost
all of the drum and cymbal sounds that can be
heard throughout the show, as well as throwing in
the occasional odd sound. These off-the-wall
noises can be voices, or whistles, or horns, or
whatever he can think up: Future Man also is the
lead vocalist on the few songs that are not
instrumentals.

The latest addition to the Flecktones lineup,
Jeff Coffin; brings his many
years of experience anda hand-
ful of saxophones into the fray.
His contributions can mostly
be felt on the new tunes that
were written forthe Flecktones
latest album, “Left of Cool.”
Watch out for song where he
will pull out two saxophones
and play them both at the same
time!

No matter how astound-
ing their music is when heard
on aCD, you just can not rep-

Tree o

This week’s tree, the Chinese Evergreen Oak
(Quercus myrsinifolia), is covered with brilliant,
green leaves even though winter abruptly reminds
us that itisn’t yet finished. There are three Chinese
Evergreen Oaks on campus. You've passed these
three beauties on your way up the hill or to class
hundreds of times. Start stopping and giving them
a closer look.

From a distance, the leaves of this tree make
it look more like a peach than an oak. Many
varieties of oak leaves are thick and waxy, often
with distinctive lobes, but the Chinese evergreen
oak has long, oval-shaped leaves with saw-like
teeth along the edge. While most oaks drop their
leaves in the fall, this one stays green throughout
even the coldest of winters. Native to China and
Japan, this species has adapted to conditions as
harsh as those in the Himalayas. Most evergreen
trees have very slender leaves or needles to help
conserve water, but the leaves of the Chinese

he week

evergreen oak are fairly broad.

The bark and acorns of this tree are distinc-
tive. Their appearance calls up memories indica-
tive more of Africa than Asia. The bark is quite
smooth as compared with other oaks. Itlooks more
like its brother the beech (you know, the one by the
Commons’ patio). This bark is gray and develops
darker gray stripes with age. Check out the tree in
front of Cannon, whose trunk resembles a leathery
rhinoceros leg. Like all oaks, these trees reproduce
by dropping acorns, the hard-covered fruit at-
tached to branches by rounded caps. What is
unique about the Chinese evergreen oak is that
these caps are not evenly textured, but decorated
by concentric rings. These acorn caps look sur-
prisingly like the neatly-trimmed thatched roofs of
southern African rhondovels (round mud huts).

You can locate a Chinese evergreen oak in
the area between Duke and Sentelle, where it is the
only tree still with leaves. Amidst the massive
magnolias and the muddy mess, two more trees are
just right of the path that leads from Sentelle to
Chambers. Enjoy these unique trees this week and

The things that these four guys
do on stage will blow your
mind and this is definitely a
show not to be missed. Tick-
ets are going quickly and with
upcoming articles in the Char-

will disappear soon. The show
begins at 8:00 PM in Love

general admission show and
we want students up front, the
doors open for students at 7:00
and then at 7:30 for everyone
else. So, if you want to be way
down in front, then I would
suggest getting there right
when the doors open.
