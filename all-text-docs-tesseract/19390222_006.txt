The Philanthropic Literary
Society is making a survey of
alumni to find

distinguished men in

North
Carolina who were Phi’s while
at Davidson.

Since the society was formerly
composed only of North Carolina
men it is thought that some of these
former men have attained promin-
ence in their native state. When the
results are published by the com-
mittee, under the leadership of
Jerry Doster, these records are ex-

Plan Joint Meeting

Plans were made for a “joint
meeting with the Eumenean Society
in the near future at which book
reports will be presented by mem-
bers of both societies. The theme
of the program will be “Contempo-
rary Literature.” A suggestion will
be made to the effect that
the societies should collaborate with
the Lecture Committee of the Col-
lege in sponsoring a speech, by a
contemporary writer during ‘next
school session.

Melvin Goforth led the  devo-
tionals at last night's meeting. San-
dy McEachern reviewed a_ book
and Tom Fry made an ex-tempo-
raneous speech on his native state—
Georgia.
