Women's Cross Country competes in NCAA's Region II race

By Jean DeMoss

596 lean, fast legs belonging
to 298 runners, representing 40
women’scross-country teams con-
gregated at Furman University for
the Region Meet on Saturday No-
vember 13th. The biggest region
meet ever to be held at Furman,
teams traveled from as far as
Florida, Alabama, and Virginia to
represent their schools.

The starting line sprawled

across the Furman golf course. At
11a.m., the starting command was

issued and the gun went off. Run- ::

ners sprinted out of their boxes, the
top teams competing for bids to the
national meet.

Crowded and congested, the
pack of runners battled valiantly
throughout the race. The first mile
passed by quickly, the first runner,
a freshmen from Univ. of Ala-
bama, went through the mile at

5:05.

Davidson runners held their
own over the 3.1 mile: course.
Weather conditions and team en-
couragement persuading the harri-
ers to run fast. And the Davidson
women needed little motivation to
run fast because this was the last
race of the season.

After looping around several
holes of the golf course for over
two miles andrunning upand down

hills for the last half mile, Carolyn
Meadows crossed the finish line in

(20:08), a personal best for the

season. She was followed by Katie
McKelvie (20:19) who also ran
her fastest time ever in cross-coun-
try. Both girls had to keep the
crowds away for autographs.
Marie Grisez finished third for
the team (20:25). Stephanie Moses
(20:29) and Erin Roach (20:35)
finished right behind Grisez. Jean

DeMoss and Alicia Dandar
rounded out the Davidson field.

A young team, with much to
look for in the future, Davidson
harriers put in a valiant team effort
for the last race.

The harriers’ spikes will be in
the lockeroom for another week of
active rest, then the runners plunge
into the track season. Each mem-
ber of the team looks forward to
the challenge.

catcher for the Chicago Cubs. In
1991, Simonds had an outstanding
year, moving from AA Charlotte
to AAA Iowa, earning an invite to
spring training in 1992. After earn-
ing the bullpen spot, he has kept
that position for the past two years
and looks to receive playing time
during the ’94 season.
BASKETBALL

*Detlef Musch (’93) was quickly
picked up by a professional Ger-
man team and returned to his home
in August to begin competition.
The 7-foot standout plays for the
Bayer Leverkusen. In Germany,
teams are represented by compa-
nies and Bayer Asprin carries a
large amount of business in the
country. The teams are fully spon-
sored and supported by the compa-
nies. Leverkusen has consistently
been the best team in Germany the
past few years. After the season,
there is a post-season tournament
to determine the German cham-
pion, which will compete in the
Euro Cup Championship in May.

Musch is averaging about 22 min-
utes of play per game. His playing
time should increase since the
teammate he was splitting time
with just left the team. Musch is
currently under a3 year, $450,000
contract and has been invited to the
tryouts for the 1996 German Olym-
pic Team. Leverkusen stands as
the best team in Germany and made
it to the semifinals of the
McDonalds Open which featured
the NBA’s Phoenix Suns.

¢Derek Rucker (’86), the former
secondteam All-American in 1986,
that led Davidson to their last
NCAA appearance, ended up
“down under” competing in
Australia’s National Basketball
League for the Brisbane Bullets.
In 1990, Rucker owned the league,
averaging 33 points a game, while
picking up every award imagin-
able. The hot shooter led the league
in scoring, was selected to the NBL
All-Star game, picking up the
game’s MVP trophy, and was the
unanimous MVP of the league.
During the off-season, Rucker
struggled through contract disputes

and the frustration showed on the
court in 1991. His stats dropped,
along with playing time and popu-
larity with the organization. Ru-
mors placed Rucker somewhere in
the CBA during the 1992 season
and believe that he has headed

back to Australia to play in the

NBL.

SOCCER

*Rob Ukrop (’93)has found anew
home in Baltimore playing for the
Baltimore Spirit in the indoor Na-
tional Professional Soccer League.
The former All-American that led
Davidson to the Final Four last
year has found little trouble find-
ing work in professional soccer.
Last summer, Ukrop competed in
the University Games forthe South
Region. Though he received lim-
ited playing time, he was extremely

effective, scoring in most appear- ~

ances. The Spirit leads the league
with a 4-0 record. Like hockey, the

line. In the team’s first four games,
he has scored a total of 4 goals.
Ukrop’s skills favor the indoor
league with his effective finishing
and quick release. He’s living on
the river, “having a good time,”
and plans to return to Davidson for
the Final Four as a spectator.

For the small size of Davidson

THE ROAD TO DAVIDSON

with primarily non-scholarshipath-
letics, to have eight professional
athletes is impressive, especially
the baseball program. If there are
eight now, three of which gradu-
ated last May, Davidson College
can look for more to come. There
are certainly professional prospects
on this year’s baseball and basket-
ball teams in athletes such as Brett
Boretti and Janko Narat.
