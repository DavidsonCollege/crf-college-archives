Munroe, an old Davidson man of ’73, will
sadden the hearts of his fellow-alumni. |
He died December 12, 1923 at his home in
Milford, Tex.

Dr. Munroe was born in Mont-
gomery County, N. C., May 16, 1850. Be-
sides bein a graduate of Davidson Col-
lege, he finished at Union Seminary, of
Virginia, and began his long period of
service in the pastorate of Mt. Holly
and Camden, Ark., in the year 1878. From

“that time he was engaged in the active
ministry of the Gospel for a total of 46
years. Failing strength forced him to
retire, in 1920, to his home at Milford,
where the last of his years of service
were spent.

His two older brothers, Rev. C. A.
Munroe, '72, deceased, and Rev. Dugald
Munroe, '72, of Red Springs, N. C.. were
fellow workers with him in the Gospel
ministry. His younger brother, Dr. J.
P. Munroe, '82, is an elder in the First
Presbyterian Church, of Charlotte, N. C.
He is survived by three sons, Rev. E. M.
Munroe, Jr., ’08, W. E. Munroe, and Dr.
R. M. Munroe. Three daughters survive
him; one the wife of Rev. T. L. Green,
the others being Miss Margaret Munroe
and Miss Juannette Munroe.

Wherever Dr. Munroe ministered his
people were affectionately devoted to
him. He preached the Gospel with
earnestness, constancy, faithfulness and
intelligence. He, truly, was deserving
of his heavenly award.

A contract was let on January 7th, to
the Electric Construction Co., of Char-
lotte, to complete the eight inch well and
sink one or more wells, twelve inches in

diameter.

a desire for the Davidson men to attend
as many services as possible, and local

service for those men who wish to hear
the famous evangelist.
