Bad checks enrage locals

As the end of school nears, the SGA Bad Check Committee has
‘been receiving urgent complaints from local merchants.

Delinquent checks have mounted to over a hundred dollars
recently, with complaints totalling over $75.00 from Cashion’s
alone.

Davidson's students are urged to cooperate with the Committee.
Disciplinary procedures are at the discretior of the Dean of
Students and may include withholding of grades and warrants from
Davidson Police.

The Committee recommends that students not close accounts at
local banks before last minute checks have been cleared. If any
questions/complaints arise, contact Will Terry or Bill Peeples.

Clark reestablishes Forum

The Interorganizational Forum, an organization involving the
heads of various campus organizations has been revived by Union
President Mary Jo Clark.

Last active two years ago, the forum met on a weekly basis to
discuss pending activities. Members are the heads of the SGA,
WDAYV, the Black Student Coalition, the YMCA, the College
Union, and the Patterson Court Council.

The focus of the Forum, according to Clark, will be ‘‘a more
unified approach through increased awareness of one another’s
programs.”

The IMC also discussed the
Grey land gift. The 860-acre
tract near Raleigh has been
valyed-at' more than $1 million
and is the largest ‘‘deferred
gift’’ in the College’s history.

The Trustees decided that the
land should be sold at a
reasonable price as soon as
possible, said Spencer.

The Executive Committee al-
so heard a proposal from a
group of citizens from Charlotte
interested in child abuse preve-
ntion. The group proposes that
the college work with them on
this project. The response of the
Board seemed favorable, ac-

cording to Spencer.

The Development Committee
discussed the development con-
sultant’s report.

It was recommended that the
Trustees meet to deal in depth
with the college, its develop-
ment, and the Trustees’ rela-
tion to the college’s develop-
ment, said Spencer.

‘‘The Trustees need to be
thoroughly grounded in the
goals of the 1987 plan,’’ he
added. ‘‘They decided to devote
their meeting in September to
this.”’

The Development Committee
also reported to the Board of

Zimmermann.

The search for a Sociology
Department Chairman is still
open and will begin anew in the
fall, according to Zimmermann.

Professor of Sociology Robert
D. Ruth will remain acting
chairman of the department, he
said.

“There is a great likelihood
for making a temporary ap-
pointment in the Sociology
Department,’’ remarked Zim-
mermann.

Although two departments
recommended women for posi-
tions, no offers have been made
to women. ‘‘I think there will be
before the search is over,’’ said
Zimmermann. ‘We are strain-
ing our categories and one of
these is women,” he explained.

Michael J. Root, 27, was
hired as an Instructor of Reli-
gion. His specialty is modern
theology and he will be offering
courses which include the criti-
cism of religion as well as
Buddhism.

Root received his B.A. at
Dartmouth and his M.A. in
Philosophy at Yale, where his
Ph.D. is in progress.

next year to fill the position
vacated by David Rice. The
search for a new permanent
professor will begin in the fall,
according to Zimmermann. ,

Trustees that Davidson has
received an all-time high record
of gifts this year. ‘‘We are
already over the $3 million
mark, primarily because of the
anonymous gift last August,”
said Vice President for Develop.
ment Duane Dittman.

“Davidson’s 1987 plan alréa-
dy counts more than $6 million
in gifts received and in future
commitments.’’ he concluded.

The Education Committee

1978-79 faculty, and recommen-

reminded me that once a mis-
take is made, it is most impor-
tant to rebound and learn from
it.

‘And finally, my thanks to
the newspaper staff. The staff |
brought in with me in January
was young (predominantly
freshmen and sophomores), and
at the time I stepped aside from

. the editorship many were just

beginning to feel ‘at home,’ with
the responsibility I had asked
them to assume.

‘In my absence, they were
burdened with learning new
working relationships and assu-
ming heavier responsibilities.

“Yet through it all, no one on
the staff missed a step and the
quality of The Davidsonian has
continued to improve.

“Special thanks to Pam Ca-
merra, who knew the work she
was in for if she accepted the
editorship and still took on the
task.

‘Pam had served in a differ-
ent position each term she has
worked with the newspaper--
from staff writer to assistant
news editor to news editor to
acting editor--and, throughout,
her commitment to The David-
sonian has been extraordinary.
That commitment will be sorely
missed while Pam spends her
Junior Year Abroad in Germa-
ny next year.

“IT am very proud of, the
dedication to quality displayed
by the entire newspaper staff
this year, and I eagerly antici-
pate the opportunity to work
with them again at the conclu-
sion of this term.”’
