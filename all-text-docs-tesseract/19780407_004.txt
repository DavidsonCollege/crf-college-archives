Student voice revisited

By GEORGE MURDAUGH
Editorial Page Editor

Stop and think. Who were the
class senators you elected last year to
represent you in the SGA? If it takes a
few minutes to recall the names (or if
you can’t remember at all), don't
assume you're the only one in this
predicament. Unfortunately, you are
not alone.

Dorm senators were- elected just last
fall, but perhaps their names are
slipping away from us as well. When
was the last time a dorm senator came
by your room to fill you in on current
Senate activities or to solicit suggest-
ions, opinions, or other input?

And, while we’re playing Twenty
Questions, do you seek out your
senators to let them know your opinion
on a current issue or to seek help in
initiating plans, programs, or solutions
which you would like to see implemen-
ted? It is a two-way street.

Student involvement is fine and
dandy, but it just doesn’t happen when
communications break down. There are
avenues open which can be used more
widely to make ourselves heard in
constructive ways.

Senators, especially dorm senators,
should seek student input more syste-
matically. A number of candidates who
won senate seats this week advocated
greater use of student polls.

If a visitation method is used,
perhaps senators could let halls know
ahead of time that they will be coming
aggund. In this way students could be

‘ready in advance with questions and

suggestions, rather than be caught
point-blank with little time to remem-
ber their ideas.

At any rate, something more than an
occasional copy of the Senate minutes
hanging over (or in) the water fountain
is needed.

Another way to assert student voice
in through direct or indirect contact
with the Trustees. Talking to them
when they are on campus and urging
SGA action to organize student repre-
sentation at Trustee meetings are
possibilities in this area.

The Senate is now making appoint-
ments to administration and faculty
councils and committees. Students
serve in some of these groups only in an
advisory capacity. But faculty and
staff members cannot be expected to
know about student opinions unless
student representatives are present to
voice the concerns of their peers and
advise the faculty and staff according-
ly. Anyone interested in serving on one
of these committees should contact an
SGA member.

Certainly the editorial pages of The
Davidsonian should not be overlooked
when citing channels through which
studentinvolvement and expression of

‘concerns can be amplified. It is

intended that these pages serve as a
forum for the College community,
contained within the student (not The
Davidsonian staff) newspaper of Da-
vidson College.

Obviously, there are many ways of
actualizing this elusive quantity called
“student involvement.’’ With the ad-
vent of new student government offi-
cers and class senators, the SGA
should be a good place to begin.

_ Stop mandatory PE

4 |
ie |:
4
By DENNIS MCLAWHORN
News Editor

Mandatory physical education is well
intended I’m sure, but in many cases it
is worthless and sometimes works
contrary to its intentions.

Supposedly, PE is designed to make
us use our bodies, part of making us
complete persons.If that’s what it did,
I'd be all for it. But as far as I’m
concerned, it takes away some of my
free time which I could be using much
more constructively .

The College brags about the large
percentage of students who participate
in either intercollegiate or intramural
sports. These students obviously aren't
lacking in physical pursuits.

Presumably the College is seeking to
physically enrich the minority that
would love nothing better than to
study all day. Frequently, however,

these and more active students, too,
find the most painless way out. All
they have to do is show they can hit a
golf ball or shoot a bow and arrow and
they’re practically through with their
requirement.

What have these students gained?
Probably very little if anything. They
are not in any better shape; they are
not any more complete people than
they were before.

But the time it took to show their
proficiency (or lack thereof) could have
been better utilized in most cases.

A major consideration here is that
PE courses will probably not drag a
student away from his books anyway.
If a student has a paper due the
following day more than likely he won’t
take off two hours to go to sailing class.
He would normally go sailing instead of
playing frisbee, basketball, or other
leisure time activities— activities which
are often more physical than the PE
courses.

Granted, any PE course can be
beneficial and many often are. It’s
great to learn some of the sports the
department teaches, but voluntary PE
courses could serve just as well.
Students shouldn’t be forced to take
something they’re not interested in,
especially if they’re active anyway.
And even the bookworms should be
allowed to sit around and get smart and
fat if they want to.

Among the forces which Sweep and play
throughout the universe, untutored man is but a
wisp in the wind. Our civilization is still in a middle
Stage, scarcely beast, in that it is no longer wholly
guided by instinct; scarcely human, in that it is not
not yet wholly guided by reason...We see man far
removed from the lairs of the jungles, his innate
instincts dulled by too near an approach to free-will,
his free-will not sufficiently developed to replace his
instincts and afford him ‘perfect guidance. He is
becoming too wise to hearken always to instincts
and desires; he is still too weak to always prevail

against them.

—Theodore Dreiser
