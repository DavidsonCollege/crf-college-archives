DR. THORNTON WHALING
INSTRUCTOR AT
LOUISVILLE SEMINARY

Classmate of Woodrow Wilson—Stands
High in List of Davidson’s Sons.

Rey. Dr. Thornton Whaling, Professor
at Louisville Theological Seminary, was
born at Radford, Va., June 5, 1858.

He, with ex-President Woodrow Wil-
son, entered Davidson asa member of
the class of ’77, but like the President,
did not remajn at Davidson long enough
to carry away the diploma of the col-
lege. However, he made good this de-
ficiency by winning the A.B. degree at
Roanoke College in 1879, the family hav-
ing moved from Charlotte to Salem, Va.;
and that of A.M. in 1885.

He attended Union Theological Semi-
nary, New York, 1879-1881, and Columbia
Theological Seminary, 1882-1883. Both
Austin and Roanoke College honored
him with the degree of D.D., and later
the Southwestern Presbyterian Univer-
sity added an LL.D. to his name and, in
continuance of the good work, Louisiana
College made him Doctor of Literature.

Ordained to the Presbyterian ministry

* in 1883, Doctor Whaling held pastorates [

in Cheraw, S. C., and Birmingham, Ala.,
from 1883 to 1902, From 1892 to 1896 he
served as Professor of Philosophy and
Economics in Southwestern Presbyterian
University. From 1896 to 1905 he was
pastor of the church at Lexington, Va.
Called from Lexington to Dallas, Tex.,
he served in the pastorate there from
1905 to IgI1.

Doctor Whaling was President of Co-
Inmbia Theological Seminary during the
years I9II-1921 and in connection with
the duties of this office filled the chair of
Didactic and Polemic Theology. He has
been Professor.of Systematic Theology
and Apologetics of Louisville Seminary
since leaving Columbia.

During these busy years as pastor,
teacher, and executive, he has found
time to write a great deal. In addition
to his contributions to the religious pa-
pers and quarterlies he has written and
published among others, the following
books: The Church and Education;
Jesus Christ and -Christian Doctrine;
Questions in Theology.

In 1913 Dr. Whaling was chosen to de-
liver the Avera Bible Lectures at Trin-
ity College.

It might be difficult to decide in what
line of work Dr. Whaling has attained
his most marked success. Certainly he
is most widely and favorably known as
an orator, as a sermon maker, as a
writer, interested particularly in both
philosophy and theology and ecclesiasti-
cal questions. Both in religious period-
icals and. on the floor of the church
courts, from the lowest to the highest,
he has proven himself a brilliant) debater
and ‘profound thinker. In his platform
work he lacks neither thought; oratori-
cal power, nor coherency in argument or
pronouncement, as was evidenced here
at Davidson last week. His command of
English is notable and affecting as he
does the rhetorical figure, and enlivening
his discourse, where occasion permits, he
is heard in any assembly with marked
interest and great pleasure by every-
body, save, it may be, the few over
whose head he unfortunately talks.

Dr. Whaling evidences his interest in
Davidson, the first Alma Mater: that
nourished him intellectually, by continu-

ing to serve, as he has for years, on the’

board of trustees and as a member of
the executive committee of the college.

THREE LIVE GHOSTS SHOWN
ON LAST SATURDAY NIGHT

“The' Three Live Ghosts” was the pic-
ture shown last Saturday night by the
Y. M. C. A. The time of the story was
immediately after the cessation of hos-
tilities in the great World War, the
scene being laid in the great English
metropolis, London. The characters,
three war buddies and a typical Irish
mother, were well portrayed.

The blunders of “Spoofy,” a demented
member of the trio, finally brought love,
prosperity and happiness to the entire
party.

In addition to the customary musical
program by the “Y” orchestra, music
was-furnished by the Columbia Seminary
Quartette.

The picture’ for next Saturday, ac-
cording to schedule, is “Get Rich Quick
Wallingford.” This film has been widely
advertised and is highly recommended.

If she didn’t have her hair bobbed,
If she didn’t dobber with paint,

If she had her dresses made to reach
To where dresses ain't.

If she didn’t have that baby voice,
And spoke as she should;

Don’t you think she’d be as popular?
I hardly think she would.
