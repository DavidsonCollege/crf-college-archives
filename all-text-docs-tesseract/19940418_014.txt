Lacrosse wins two out of three

By Lee Brumby
After dropping the first four
games of the season, the Davidson

Lacrosse team posted its second

consecutive win Wednesday,
trouncing Guillford 16-3. The lady
Cats came out strong with a goal
by Liz Schaper in the first minutes
and never looked back.
Davidson’s offensive effort
was led by Amanda Bryan with 5
goals, Hedy Moolenaar with 4, and
Schaper contributed 3 for the lady
Cats. On the defensive end the
tandem of Lynn Daubenspeck,
Allison Rhoads and Allison Adams

came up big. The threesome “has a
lot of game sense and works well
together,” said Coach Manning.

In the last two games,
Davidson has out-scored their op-
ponents 34-7. Manning is thrilled
with the team’s progress. “This
was by far the best effort of the
season. We came up with the big
plays and were able to execute on
our scoring opportunities,” said
Manning.

The team then traveled to Duke
to face their club team and came
away with their biggest victory of

the year, 10-9, but fell to Longwood
8-3. Davidson’s recent successes
have given the team confidence as
they look toward the rest of the
schedule. They travel to Greens-
boro on Tuesday before finishing
the season this weekend at Ameri-
can and St. Josephs.

Wildcats take top baseball team, 6-4

Cats continued from page 1

1-3-5 double play. One batter later,
All-American catcher Jason
Varitek hit his seventh home run of
the year The Wildcat pitching staff
forced Tech to strand nine batters
on base and got 13 outs at first
base.

In the top of the sixth inning,
Davidson held a 4-3. lead.
Leftfielder Paul Brannan led off
with a double. Two batters later,
freshman Brad Edwards hit his first
collegiate home run to give the
Wildcats a 3-run lead.

“As the game progressed our
guys realized it would be not only
be a close game, but a game to
win,” said Cooke

Davidson took the 6-4 advan-

tage into the ninth inning with Tech
starting at the top of the batting
order. Garciaparra grounded out to
third base for the first out. The next
two batters reached base, so with
one out Tech had runners on first
and second. Senior relief pitcher
Brian Heil came in for Pollard to
face cleanup hitter Payton, the
faster player in the ACC. Heil’s
first pitch was grounded to short-
stop Jeff Andrews, who tossed the
ball to junior Mark Reilly, who
turned the double play to Hall for
the final two outs and the victory.
Final score: Davidson 6, Georgia
Tech 4.

“They’re aclassy program, so
it was nice to get the victory in the
that type of environment,” said
Cooke.

Hall went 2 for 4 and Andrews
went 2 for 5. Paul Brannan went 2
for 4 with 2 runs scored and
Andrews finished up with three
RBIs. Senior captain Brett Boretti
finished 1 for 1 at the plate, and had
two RBIs on two sacrifice flies,
raising his average on the season to
.348 and leading the team with 32
RBIs.

The Wildcats then traveled to
Georgia Southern Saturday to try
to push thier conference record
above .500, but they lost both
games of the double header by one
run, 8-7 and 3-2. Now Davidson
(14-25) will take on Wake Forest
this Wednesday here at 3:00 p.m.
before traveling to Marshall to fin-
ish Southern Conference competi-
tion.

Holland asks for alums to support athletics

Div. I contined from page 1

from the alumni as to what they
expect of Davidson athletics and
whether or not they are willing to
support the programs. “We need
you to tell us What kind of support
we can count on from you,” wrote
Holland. Response from alumni
will enable the department to make
plans for the future.

When Holland arrived at
Davidson, President Kuykendall
told him to find- an appropriate
level for the college programs.
Knowing that many people want
Davidson to have Division I ath-
letics, especially the trustees, Hol-

coaches, recruits the best athletes
who can compete in the classroom
as wellas in their games, and sched-
ules the toughest competition so
Davidson can continue at the Divi-
sion I level.

Now, however, Holland says
we need to approach the situation
rationally and go to a level that
makes sense for the college. Says

Holland, “We can’t pretend to be
something that we’re not.”

In addition, the college and
the department cannot make prom-

ises tothe coaches and athletes that -

they cannot fulfill. According to
Holland, without monetary sup-
port from outside the college, these
promises for the future will be bro-
ken.
