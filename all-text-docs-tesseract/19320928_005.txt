His absence was keenly felt by the sec-

ters this year. Last spring-Newton and
McEver considered the—pivot position

Gardner, Lucius Wooten, and J. B. Lee,
an array of center that could be matched
with the best in the Southern Confer-
ence. But Wooten failed to return to
school this year; Lee was operated on
for appendicitis just before school open-
ed, and now Gardner is out, possibly for
the remainder of the season.

Coaches Laird and Mathis must have
been feeding the 600 pounds of Fresh-
men, which they had at the beginning of
school, something in order to have pre-
sented such a strong team on the field
last Friday. The yearlings showed both
offensive and defensive power in crush-
ing Presbyterian Junior College by four
touchdowns, and although they do not
look as strong as the 1931 Freshman
team, they should make an enviable rec-
ord.
