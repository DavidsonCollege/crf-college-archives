Today I overheard an old man praying for strngth,

Today I say a child with no arms

Today I felt the trembling of a woman’s hand

Today you told me you failed a test.

I’m sorry-

Perspective on Davidson from J.Y.A.

having lost his wife to terminal cancer
but hours before.

vainly fight tears of frustration,
attempting to prove to taunting playmates
that he could indeed play baseball.

as she stammered that with each
six minute segment of time
yet another woman is raped.

I don’t understand your grief.

The Collector

As DNA joins and replicates, | engage with language and
am broadened. | hook up, seize, roll away and become 3
bigger. We touch terminals again, we meld, and | am bigger
still. | look out from my post at all that is inside and am afraid; :
frightened as | run my fingers over the bulbous texture of the
universe,

lam the worst of derelicts, lawbreakers and mix-breeds. |
am an assassin, a Cuss, a cheat. |am a word. Yes, language
too, and quite a bag.

Words writhe as they curl from my pencil. This word and
then this one and then this one. Cute little symbols. Cute little
pieces of me. Brain pellets.

John and | decided that we have always been collectors.
of language. Like greedy, little men we have pushed words,
sentences and even whole paragraphs into our pockets to :
look at them later in our hideouts and offices.. We held them :
; up to the light and remembered their peculiar sparkle. We :
ix walked down vast corridors pulling big levers and wheels and
hung these stringy symbols on hooks beside other strings of
symbols. — ;

Now, in the great warehouses of my mind, these racks é
extend for miles and on the floor words like snakes are coiling

and wrapping and joining together and with some of them | :
dialogue with you. , ; : :
