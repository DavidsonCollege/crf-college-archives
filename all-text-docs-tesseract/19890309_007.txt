WASHERS, from page 5

Crews felt that more machines
should be available to the students.

Pritchard, however, stated that
there is not room in Akers, Knox
and Irwin for more machines, and
the ones removed from Watts will
be used for spare parts. He also

_ noted that the school hopes to

“build some kind of structure out
at the apartments over the summer
possibly to house more machines
for student use.”

So I set out to test the new ma-
chines.

Things went smoothly. I walked
in, bummed some Tide and tossed
in my stinking refuse. After set-

ting the selection knob and turning
the little thingy, I was washing.
Laundry room banter revealed
some interesting observations.

Freshman Natasha Williams
noted that the latest additions are
“newer than the old ones” and
“they leak less.” Freshman Mar-
shal Akers astutely noted that
“They’re white.” When asked
what she looked for in a quality
washer, a visiting Duke freshman
stated, “I look for a really fast spin
cycle.” Those Blue Devils know
what they want.

Representing the sophomore
class, Clay Adams, also a spin
cycle fan, noted, “It certainly is a
sense of power to wash your own
clothes with someone else’s deter-

7

gent,” which has nothing to do
with the new washers. Sophomore
Rudy Lewis had no comment on
the entire situation.

Overall, the mission was a suc-
cess. The new machines effi-
ciently transferred the smell from
my socks to my sweater, and I was
on my way home. One of the
machines, however, began to leak
at its connection with the wall pipe
as I was leaving. Water poured out
and the floor got wet, just like the
old days.

The problem seems to be only a
simple pipe connection and the
maintenance department should
have it repaired with no problem at
all.

BREAK! from page 5

what an “ideal Spring Break”
would be. One sophomore de-
scribed her idea of the perfect
break by saying, “It doesn’t
matter—any beach, just away from

here!”

Some students imagined that
President .Kuykendall’s plans for
Spring Break would include add-
ing zeroes to our tuition fees.

No matter what you’re doing,
where you’re going or how much

you ’re spending, take the opportu-
nity to blow off steam. The ad-
ministration will appreciate it. The
custodians will appreciate it. Have
fun because you’ve got six more
wecks of hell when you return.
Aha! That’s why we do it!

WATSONS, from page 4

selective colleges are awarded
$13,000 to study a field of their
interest.

Raney wants to study the phe-
nomenon of rape and cultural per-
ceptions and approaches to the
crime. Her study will take her to
France, Quebec and Martinique.

Mallory proposes to study the
ability of Tibetan refugee commu-

nities in exile to retain their cul-
ture, religion, rituals and other
customs while in exile, particu-
larly in Europe. She also wants to
examine what remains of the Ti-
betan culture in Tibet itself.

VanEvery wants to study the
interaction between folk and po-
litical culture and art in Central
America, especially Nicaragua.
She is particularly interested in art
used for political purposes.

Dunn’s proposal would take
him to southern A frica to study the
political, economic and social ef-
fects South Africa has on its neigh-
bors Zimbabwe, Malawi,

Botswana and Swaziland.

well in Watson Fellowship com-
petition. Since the program’s in-
ception in 1969, Davidson has
