Everybody loves a winner,
but perhaps nobody appre-
ciates a winner as much as
‘the coach who has to face
one.

VMI! Coach Mike Schuler
was in the position of decid-
ing how to play the Davidson
‘Wildcats when he and his
VMI Keydets walked onto
the floor last night with the
forces of Terry Holland look-

ing for their fifty-first in a

the scouting report.

“You try to see how the

the offensive. patterns and
the defensive alignments.”

After a scouting trip Schu-
ler talked with his assistant
and tried to decide how to
defense them and what the
Keydets should do offensively.

Schuler admits that David
son had him worried. “I
don’t khow if they have a
weakness. I know that I
watched them Tuesday night
and I’ve been trying to find
a weakness ever since. I've
been worried for three day
now.’

The trength of the Ke)

dets going into the game,
Schuler thought was their
ability to contrel the tempo
of the contest. ‘We . think
that we-can slow the game
down a bit to our pace. We
don't want to try to run with
them unless we have to.’

Berry Poll Marks Delts, Pikas :
As IMAC Basketball Favorites

By BILL BERRY
Assistant Sports Editor

IMAC basketball competi-
tion begins next week, and
although it is likely that no
team will go undefeated, the
Berry Poll will have to rate
the defending co-champions
Phi Delts as the clear fator-
ite.

The Delts return four of
Tast year's starters, most of
their bench, and add some
excellent sophomore talent

Returning starters from
1969 are Gene Early, John
MaCammon, Ed Dobbs and

Garth Hampfén. James Brice
played as much as anyone
last season and really should
be included in this group of
starters also, Other returnees
are Jack Caldwell and Jimmy
Wright

To this nucleus the
Delts add one of the

Parker To Rely On Freshmen
As Wrestlers Open Al Guilford

“We've got no seniors,
just-a few-juniors,-and-we "Wh
be starting ‘several fresh-
men this year, so I just
don't know what to expect.
We could be great, and. we
could be bad.”

With this statement David
son wrestling coach Charlie
Parker described the pros-
pects for the upcoming coll-

egiate wrestling season.

Gone. from —last-— year's
musclemen are _ Southern
Conference champion Kerry
Keith and league runner
up Dean (Cromartie, and
under such conditions many
coaches would worry.

Yet Parker doesn't know
whether ‘he'll have to worry,
because of a very promising

group of untested freshmen.

Leading the list of rookies
is Jeff Dumansky, the
134 - - pound division. Du-
mansky, who last
won the national prepschool
championship wrestling title
while attending school in New
Jersey, is. considered as a

Beverai other promising
freshmen also.very possibly
will be starting in ~ David
son’s matches this year.
Rob Benton, who wrestles

at 118, Bill Moseley at 126,
and Rusty sWinthester 134.
All have shown a_ good
deal of potential in practice
and are being counted on by
Parker to control the lower
weight classes.

Several of the upperclass-
men will also be counted on
heavily to lead the matsmen.
Ronnie Williams fast-finish-
ing sophomore who finished
fourth in the conference last
year while running up one
of. the few winning records
on the Davidson team, will
hold down the 167-pound
weight class.

Among the returning
juniors are Frank Rader,
an experienced wrestler at
190 Jack Jacobs, who finish-
ed fourth in the conference
last year at 158, Tim Ricks
at 142, Allen Kirkpatrick at
177, and Sean McCormick at
heavyweight.

Parker has reserved hopes
concerning this wrestling
season. ‘The potential is
there, but we'll have no
seniors for leadership and
the freshmen are still un-
tested. It’s difficult to say
now just how we'll do.

“By. the end of the year
we could™ really” havea
strong wrestling team, once

the freshmen get experience
and the jells. But by
then all we'll have left on
the schedule are Duke,
North Carolina and N. C.
State, plus the conference
tournament, so we'll be fac-
ing the toughest part of the
schedule.”

Actually, the opening
matches for the Wildcats
will be difficult too. The
grapplers will open against
Guilford, one of the state's
strongest small colleges,
next Friday, and then. must
face an unusually strong
UNC-C team 10 days later.
UNC has three North Car-
olina state champions this
season.

and Barden Cooke.

The Pikas lost.by only one
point to the Delts last year,
and the odds are that their

meeting will be close again. -

The Pikas are picked for
second, but have a chance
of displacing the Delts.

The Pikas also return four
starters, a strong bench and
some excellent sophomores.

Jack Ballenger and Floyd

The surprise team of the
basketball season could be
the Independents. They were’
good in flashes last
and have added some new
talent which should aid them
immensely.

Returning from last season
are Mark Thompson, Jim
Trevathan, Bill Funderburk,
Tom Merrill. ad John. Fine.
The addition of the height
of Frank Soos, Davis Liles,
and -Dave Wasserman and
the ballhandling of Jim May
will strengthen the Indies.

Coterie is the choice of the
Berry Poll for fifth place.
They will be only moderately
large, but will have. speed.
Returning from last season
are John Saunders, Herb
Clegg, Doug Haynes, Jim
Long and Bill Horton.

The addition of sophomores

will help the Coterie, but
there is not enough height
to win in the IMAC.

The Betas play more de-

anyone in the league, but
they are short on depth, so
this is necessary. The Beta
Superstar is Johnny Baker.
