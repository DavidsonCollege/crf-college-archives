Last year Wells played the greatest game
of his career against Wake Forest when the
Baptist offense was completely squelched and
Lucien took the lead in a drive that snatched
victory from the invaders during the last
half after Wake Forest had started with a

shared honors with Hendrix in playing the |

down margin. At the close of last season he |
was elected captain of the 1926 team by a
