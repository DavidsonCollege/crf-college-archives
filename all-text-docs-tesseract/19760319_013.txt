23-0. The Boogiers’ named coaches

IMAC Czar Andrews’ work praiséd

The two-year reign of IMAC
Czar Bowie Andrews came to an end
last week. Trustee and alumni pres-
sure are thought to have driven Bowie
from office.

The Czar’s last official act was to

resolve the threatened softball strike,
assuring that the season would start

on schedule. After careful screening of
many big-name applicants, it was
announced that Pete ‘‘Jeff’’ Rozelle
had taken the job for a salary esti-
mated at nothing.

In the last serious line you are apt
to read in this column, it must be said
that Bowie did a hell of a job.

Last week marked the beginning of
another season of IMAC softballing
drunkenness and debauchery.

So early in the season, it became
apparent that all the guys with the
big sticks would keep popping up in
their frustrated efforts to go for the
long ball, while the Woman’s League
would traditionally tend towards
tight defensive struggles.

However, on opening day the first
girl’s game was not quite true to form
as the Little Boogier’s laid into IKL

Corrections

The February 20 edition of the
Davidsonian incorrectly reported on
the rugby club’s first match of the
season.

The game was not a practice match
as listed and was played in Charlotte,
not Raleigh as we erroneously re-
ported.

.

Jim ‘‘Bricklayer’’ Rice and John
‘‘Machine Gun’’ Gerdy planned to
throw out the first ball, but only
managed to throw the first drunk,
both striking out swinging.

The initials IKL remain something
of a mystery, although Mun Dane
does have a theory: ‘‘Ahem. this is
my theory which is mine: I is for It’s,
K is for Kinda, and L is for Large.’’
To which the Amoeba replied,
“Glorp?!”’

In the more pedestrian male con-
frontations, the Whizy Kids smoked
Emanon, 24-5, led by hustling Tex
Collins. This weak-bladdered outfit
could be a major power if someone
could toilet train Ro Ro.

Despite Mike Gibson, the Wooley
Grays managed to crush the Aintry
Squealers by 27-11. Another senior
dominated squad, Ockham’s Razor
disgraced its class and epitomized
ineptitude by losing to lowly Richard-
son I, 6-3.

Later in the week, jockish
Henderson House ate the Pickles
whole by the whopping score of 24-4.
The thrashing reportedly caused the
poor Pickles to awake in the night
with cravings for bats and balls.

In the closest game of the day,
Juneau Joe’s Alaskan Huskies over-
came the burden of their name to edge
the Longest Yard, starring Burt
Reynolds and his Favorite Play,
11-10.

On Monday, Davidson IMAC his-
tory was made as SPE #2 actually
forfeited a game to the dancing
Rowdy Rotcies (only $10, get yours
from Bruce West), in this case
proving obnoxious in defeat.

A major upset was averted as

LITTLE BOOGIER Marty Hunt grits her teeth
agianst the IKL pitcher during the opening
game of IMAC girls’ softball. The Little
Boogiers smashed IKL 23-0.

-

Passive Indifference rallied to nip
upstart Cannon IV, 13-12. The near
defeat was blamed on John Tatum,
who. ne cted to bring the Busch.

In this week’s highlight game, the
Clap, led by reinstated spirochette
Pimp Blanchard, infected the SAE’s
9-8. The Clap’s brilliant base-running
became an obvious sore spot for the
unwary E's.

For future Clap opponents and
close friends of the E’s, penicillin will
be available in the IMAC office.

Taints, whose franchise has been
moved to the Superdome from beauti-
ful Cleveland.

The Taints, however, are already
torn by dissension as first baseman
Tom Verlin has been suspended from
the roster until he gets down to his
playing weight of 93 pounds.

We still have no replies in our
