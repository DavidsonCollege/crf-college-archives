Epidemic
Not Result
Of Food

Food poisoning has been ruled
out as possible cause of. last
week's epidemic, according to
Dr. James B. Woods, college
physician.

The illness which struck the
campus last Thursday was at-
tributed to the Union food at
supper by many students.

Wayne H. Shroyer. district su-
pervisor of the food service
which operates the Union cafe-
- teria, said that S0 or 60 sam-
ples of the food served were
turned over to the Mecklenburg
County Health Department.
According to Shroyer, health
officials said that the samples
reveated no harmful bacteria,
| and that the cause was “prob-
; ably an airborne virus."
Shroyer conceded the possibil-
ity “that one pan. of food be-
came contaminated after it was
ready to be served.” However.
he maintained that “this was not
a case of food poisoning.”
“The only difference between
virus and food potsoning is the
way in which it spreads.” said
Woods. ‘With food poisoning it
hits everybody at once and is
over.”

A few were sick before Thurs-
day, according to Woods. and
then the avalanche came Thurs-

day and Friday.

INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM

‘Whites Get Land; Blacks, The Bible’

By GARY SIGMON
Staff Writer
Popular hysteria over Black
Power is just one more evidence
of the institutionalization of rac-
ism in Western civilization ac-
cording to the view of George
Ware, a Student Non-Violence
Coordinating Committee campus

SNCC’s

By DANNY COLTRANE
Staff Writer

SNCC's advocation of Black
Power is the best way to give
to the Negro the rights he de-
serves as a human being and as
a builder of the U. S. claimed
George Ware yesterday after-
noon.

Ware sees. as a fundamental
problem in his organization's
fight, the incapability of Ameri-
can society to condemn it-
self. ‘The S.N.C.C has condemn-
ed it for the way it has treated
black power." he announced.

coordinator who visited David-
son yesterday.

He said that throughout the
history of Western civilization
there has been a people who has
said ‘“‘what's happening” and
then tried to change and control
other people. He gave as an ex-
ample the white people infiltrat-

ing Africa.

“When the white man first
came to Africa. the black man
had the land and the white man
had the Bible. Now the white
man has the land and the black
man still has the Bible,” he
claimed.

Ware stated that the black

Role Justified

He feels that most of S.N.-
C.C.’s efforts need to be direct-
ed toward organizing blacks.

Although a number of separate
civil rights groups are currently
at work, he pointed out that
there seemed to be no necessity
in their unification since their
work is being concentrated in
different areas.

Ware was associated for six
years with the S.N.C.C. while it
proclaimed a doctrine of ‘‘non-
violence’ but he now rejects
this method of ‘‘appeal to man's
moral conscience’ as having
failed.

He indicated that the S.N.C.C.
would use any legal means to
achieve its aims and he empha-
sized the effectiveness of polit:
ical and economic channels.

Although Negroes number af-
proximately one-tenth of the pop-
ulation, he claimed that because
of certain areas of concentra-
tion that they could potentially
contro! thirty congressional
seats.

S.N.C.C. voter education and
registration have been designed
to work toward a fuller use of
black voting power.

Presidential Stands Set

Three members of this year's
Student Council and an Honor
Court member will face off
Thursday for the Presidency of
the Student Body.

First. Vice President Julian
Prosser. Second Vice-President
Tom Earnhardt, Junior repre-
sentative Bill. Watcon. and Hon-
or Court Recorder Ron Hunt will
address the Student Body during
chapel Wednesday before elec-
tions the following day.

Earnhardt advocates a consist-
ent number and quality of Artist
Series performances and lec-
lures as well as adequate pub-
licity and greater financial sup-
port for them. The Educational
Planning Program and the Stu-
dent Recruiting Program should
both be expanded. he contends.

Other proposals include better
dialogue between students and
alumni through = student —pro-
grams at alumni and trustee

Election Procedures
Outlined; Dates Picked

Honor Court elections will be
held March 14, and YMCA offi-
cers, freshman advisor, and
cheerleaders will be chosen two
days later, according to John
Fagg. chairman of the election
committee.

Student Council elections and
run-offs will end the three-week
period with the final election on
March 21 and the run-off the fol-
lowing day.

Polls for all elections will be
open from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
and from 1:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
in the lobby of Chambers. Ab-
sentee ballots must be obtained
in room 02 of Richardson Dorm
at least 24 hours before the elec-
tion.

Filing must be done in Rich-
ardson 02 for offices by Sunday
midnight before the week in
which the election for that par-
ticular office takes place.

A recent change made by the
Student Council makes it unnec-
essary for a member of the
Honor Court to resign in order
to run for a student body office
or defense advisor. although the
Honor Court post must be sur-
rendered if the other post is won.

An additional change requires
that all cheerleaders stand for

people are a group rendered
powerless by the white man,
“not because we're lazy, or have
rhythm, or eat watermelons.”

Ware remarked that Negro
ghettos become slums because
the black people don't own the
businesses and establishments.
Thus all profits go out of the
ghetto into the pocket of the
white owner.

As an example of institutional
racism he compared the death
of four girls in a church bomb-
ing in Birmingham to the death
of more than three hundred Ne-
gro babies due to a lack of med-
ical facilities in the same town.

The first act was an act of in-
dividual racism, but the second
is what he calls institutional rac-
ism. The problem facing the Ne-
gro is how to fight this system.

Education, the normal means
of attaining success, is kept from
the Negro, he said. Although the
average level of education in the
United States is the tenth grade,
white people expect the Negro
to’ surpass this to be accepted.

“We must be supermen to be
accepted and even then some re-

election each year. Old cheér-.
leaders must nominate them-
selves with Fagg instead of
through the squad itself.

Posters which were employed
by several of the candidates in
last week's Social Council and
Union Board election were used
after special permission was
granted by the election commit-
tee. According to Fagg. no such
posters can be utilized in the
remaining elections.

meetings, subsidization of the
Student Store for the purchase
of non-textbooks, and represen-
tation for the newly proposed
Residence Hal! Council on the
Student Council.

Hunt is advocating a five point
program which includes an in
creased student voice, particu-
larly through the Blue Sky Com
mittee. a better student ex-
change program and continued
curriculum revision. He has call-
ed for reevaluation and revision
of the Freshman Orientation
Program. and emphasized that
the Student Council must be ‘‘a
motivating force within the Stu.
dent Body rather than an elect-
ed group which merely meets
once a week.”

Prosser’s platform places ma-
jor emphasis upon changing and
directing the development of
college policy. He has outlined
a cabinet-type set of advisers to
the Student Body President who
would probably be the ‘student
representatives on faculty com-
mittees and the establishment of
student committees which would
correspond to certain faculty
committees and would pursue

problems especially important to
the Student. Body.

Prosser wants to continue uti-
lizing the newspaper in arousing
student opinion and to stimulate
student awareness and involve-
ment through hall! discussions on
specific problems.

Emphasizing the Student Coun-
cil's failure to provide effective
leadership during a crucial peri-
od of change, Watson is calling
for the replacement of the Coun
cil by a campus government. in
the form of a Student Govern-
ment Association. This associa- .
tion would consist of an Execu-
tive Committec, 4 Student Sen-
ate, nine standing committees
and a ‘College Méeting’’.

The _ Executive Committee
would propose programs. the
Senate would seek to implement
them, and the standing commit-
tees would exert influence on
corresponding faculty commit.
lees.

The College Meeting would
take place once a month and
would be an open discussion be-
tween the College President, the
two deans and the student body.

Bloc Voting Prohibition
Reaffirmed By Council

By BOB DUNHAM
Staff Writer

Student Council Monday night
voted down a proposal by senior
Louis Lesesne that the Student
Council By-Law prohibiting bloc
voting be dropped.

The motion. which had heen
tabled at the previous meeting
until members could study stu-
dent reaction, failed by a vote
of 8-5, with one abstention, just

fuse to us," Ware stated.

But Ware was determined in
his attitude of perseverance. “If
the white Americans decide to
play Germans, the Negro Ameri-
cans will not play the Jews.”

short of the two-thirds vote re-
quired for passage.

The vote came after a lengthy
discussion on the possible. re-
sults of the removal of the law.
The center of this discussion
was the role of a party system
on campus, one of the possible
outcomes of the move.

The rule in question is section
two of the by-laws, paragraph k,
which reads: ‘‘Open discussion
of candidates and issues is: en-
couraged. However, organized
solicitation and combines or ef-
forts to encourage bloc voting or
vote swapping along organiza-
tional lines’ shall be illegal. Any
financial support of any candi-
date in any form whatsover
shall be illegal. The penalty for
violation of any of these rules
shall be the loss of voting privi-
leges for all individuals involved
and a fine of from $50 to $100
levied against all organizations
involved.”

As revised the rule would have
read: “Open discussion of can-
didates and issues is encour-
aged. However, any financial
support for any candidate in any
form whatsoever shall be illegal.
The penalty for violation of this
rule shall be the loss of voting
privileges for all individuals in-
volved.”

This rule as proposed would

| still prohibit well-organized par-

ties.

The discussion on the proposal
brought out several different
viewpoints on the merits of the
party system on campus. Le-
sesne stated that although he

‘|was “certainly not advocating a

‘ —— en

party system,”” he thought that
the system might be a ‘good
thing for Davidson.”

One council member pointed
out that there had been many
changes made in election pro-

cedures, which do not coincide
with this rule. Another stated
that the proposed changes could
make for “much more lively
elections."

Council President Chuck Mat-
thews advocated the party idea,

Athietic
Issue
Shunned

Until facts and figures con-
cerning the issue could be pre-
sented, Student Council mem-
bers decided to abstain from ap-
proval of a resolution for the
approval of subsidized athletics
Monday night.

Both sides on the issue claim-
ed to have “the facts” concern-
ing the effect of subsidized ath-
letics on the college. However.
there was.a considerable differ-
ence in the “‘facts’’ which each
side presented.

John Fagg said that according
to his sources. it would cost
more to run a_ non-subsidized
athletic program than the sub-
sidized program now in prog-
ress,

Opponents to subsidized ath-
letics on the council stated that.
their sources revealed just the
opposite.

William Rikard. one council
member who favored the sub-
sidized program, backed up
Fagg’s argument. He also stated
that there were numerous mis-
representations in a_ letter
which appeared in THE DAVID.
SONIAN last week which rec-
ommended the removal of sub-
sidized athletics from the David-
son program.
