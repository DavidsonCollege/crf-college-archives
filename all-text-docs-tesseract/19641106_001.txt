CALLS CAMPAIGN SIGNALS
Secor Referees Election

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonien Feature Writer

The last whistle of the
game has blown. The teams
have retired to the side-
lines and look to the score-
board for the decision. The
supporters in the grand-
stand, after the contest
quietens, settle back to
await the outcome.

Sound like a football game?
Well. it was not. It was the 1964
political campaign. Dr. Philip
Secor compared the campaign
with a game, a game that the
entire nation played. The can-
didate were the players, the
campaign managers and avid
boosters were the cheerleaders,
the voters were the spectators,
and Secor was the referee.

Americans love a contest and
they love outdoor sports: ac-
cording to Secor. politics is a
sport—in fact, two sports in one.
There is the obvious physical
contest where the stakes, elec-
tion and power, are high.

And then there is the contest
of intellect and ideals in which
the stakes are still higher, for
in this fray the voters decide
which team is ‘“‘rationally and
morally worthy.”

SECOR'S SWEEPSTAKES

Davidson College this year
had a contest of its own, This
contest was the idea of Secor.
intended to promote interest in
the political campaign. The
Sweepstakes was a game in
which the player marked on a
ballot the name of the man
whom he believed would win the
race in which he was entered.

There were three ballots, one
showing presidentiaal voting
trends for the past 36 years and
a space beside each state for
voting, a second with spaces
for the senatorial candidates.
and a third with spaces for the
states’ gubernatorial'candidates.

Judging of the contest was
done ‘by Secor; he was to

check the presidential ballots
first. and only in case of a tie
would he move on to the sena-
torial and to the gubernatorial.
Prizes for the top three voters
were offered in the amounts of
$25, $15 and $10, respectively.

HOW TO CHOOSE

But how were the voters to
choose for whom to vote? Se-
cor, speaking in assembly Tues-
day. was not about to let the
student body go without ex-
plaining why people were going
to vote for whom they were.

In this year's game of poli-
tics, he said, the directions of

‘the candidates are not clearly

defined, neither right nor left.

There is some doubt about the

identity of Democrats and Re-
publicans, about on which side
of the field they sit. This year
some of the leading contenders
are on the wrong team, he said.

RAH! RAH! RAH!

pressions of faith from the
cheerleaders: ‘‘Constitution. Na-
tional Security. Individualism
—Rah! Rah! Rah!!" or ‘‘Jus-
tice, Peace, Economic Growth—
Go! Team! Go’ But how to
choose?

On the line of scrimmage
comes the clash of disagreement
on the major issues: National
Security, Justice, Peace, Econ-
omy. Viet Nam. Communist
China. But how to choose?

Said Secor, ‘In the end lan-
guage fails us and reason is
unable to determine, They must
play and we must choose.” But
how to choose?

PLAYING FIELD

After all has been said, de-
clared Secor. the voter must
choose his candidate by de-
scending from the grandstand
to the playing field. to the
“area of emotional communi-
cation.” Here the decisions rest
with whom we “like and trust
as against whom we dislike and
distrust.”

“I have too much pride to resign. I have said be-

The recent flurry of rumors

concerning a possible resigna-
* tion or removal of Dole were

stepped up von Thursday, Oct.

: tice,” a member of the football

team related, “Dole called us
(the team) together and made a
few remarks concerning the
coming game with VMI.

“Then he told us that he had
heard from a good friend that
he would be removed at the
end of this season.” ©

From this Thursday night;
after-practice speech, which was
supposed to be kept quiet by
those who heard it, grew the
bevy of recent rumors that
have scorched the sports pages
of several area newspapers.

TALK TO TEAM

Dole said of the post-practice
speech, “I told the football team
that 1 understood that a deci-
sion has been made to relieve
me of my duties at the end of

the season.”
This was the extent of Dole's
remarks on his talk to the team.

any comment.

When queried as to the validi-
ty of the stories, Dole replied,
“I haven't talked to anyone in
the administration. but from
what I've read in the Charlotte
papers, it apparently is not
truce.”

MARTIN REPLIES

What Dole read, and what
President D. Grier Martin said,
was, “No official action con-
cerning Dole has been taken by
the board, the executive com-
mittee, the alumni council or
any other group.

‘There may have been unof
ficial talk but. that is one of
those things that is bound to be
a matter of consideration with
people who are primarily con-
cerned with those things.”

almost ready for distribution.
Council members distributed
these Tuesday afternoon in the
dormitories.

Johnny Gresham, sophomore
representative, asked about the
possibility of keeping the lib-
rary open until! midnight on reg-
ular nights rather than the us-
ual 11 p. m. He noted that the
dormitories become noisy as
soon as people start returning
from the library and that stu-
dents generally have further
work to do.

At this point Secretary Treas-
urer Tom Frist asked that the
council take a firm stand on
the rules about noise in the
dormitories. Jackson agreed
that council members should
try to control excess noise.
Gresham was appointed to in-
vestigate the possibility of keep-
ing the library open until mid-
night.

Drinking on campus received

mal meeting with members of

Having recognized these |!
points, Snider went on to say
that he felt the Handbook could

that pictures of annual high-
lights such as Homecoming and

|Win Sweepstakes Money

By BOB VANCE

Davidsonian Staff Writer

Bob Baker won first prize in Davidson’s
novel election sweepstakes conducted on Elec-
tion Day, Nov. 3. Robert Whitton was runner-

up and Charles Ramberg came in third.

Baker, a sophomore and a member of Sigma
Phi Epsilon, was awarded the first prize of $25
and a donkey. In winning the sweepstakes he
guessed correctly the winner of the Presiden-
tial race in every state except Georgia, and the
senatorial winners in all except five states.

Whitton won the second prize of $15. He is
a junior and a member of Kappa Sigma. Ram-
berg. a senior member of Sigma Nu won the $10

third prize.

Each also missed the winner of the Presi-
dential race in one state, but incorrectly guessed
the outcome of six senatorial elections and sev-

eral gubernatorial races.

a

Taking the Sweepstakes “booby” prize of an
elephant was Jim Shackleford. He guessed that
Sen. Barry Goldwater wouid win 484 electoral
votes to 54 votes for President Lyndon Johnson
and came within two points of completely miss-
ing the actual results.

First and second runners-up for the “booby”
prize were Ross Brown and Charles Dibble, re-
spectively.

Dr. Philip Secor. who suggested and direct-
ed the election sweepstakes, stated that around
250 students participated in the contest.

While no one correctly guessed the actual
alignment of states in the electoral college re-
sults, there was one student,who guessed the
total number of electoral votes received by each
Presidential candidate.

According to Secor, there were three stu-
dents besides the winners who missed only one
state in the Presidential contest, while six oth-
ers missed but two states.

The states in the Presidential race most fre-
quently missed were Florida, Georgia, and Wy-
oming in the senatorial contests, ‘‘upsetting”
the most students were Oklahoma, New York,
and California. In the gubernatorial races these
maverick states were Arizona and Wisconsin.

Dr. Secor noted that without the co-opera-
tion of Bob Stone, Assistant to President Mar-
tin, the sweepstakes could not have been held.
He also expressed his gratitude to Brad Thomp-
son Jr. for his assistance in tabulating the re-
sults.

term ss a member of Congress
from North Carolina's eighth
district, Rep. Charles Jonas
spoke in Chambers Auditorium
on election eve but political
fire and brimstone were notica
bly absent. As expected, Jonas
came to speak in his area of
greatest interest and concern—
national monetary policy.

Long a member of the House
Appropriations Committee, the
Carolina Republican spoke first
to the issue of the national
debt. He expressed his support
of a proposal to reduce the
debt at an annual rate of one
per cent.

“Under this plan,” noted
Jonas, “We would in 30 years
reduce the whole affair until
payments on. interest are final-
ly less than payments on prin-
cipal.”

Representative Jonas dismis-
sed those who would dismiss
the national debt as a matter
for real concern. He did point
out, however, that he did not
object to deficit spending in
time of war or economic. de-
pression. But what hope for
the future. he asked, “. . if we
ignore this problem in a time
of prosperity?”

There were other issues for

the visitor to confront in his
brief stay on campus. On the
farm problem, he could not ad-
vance amy suggestions but did
note that farm subsidies seem to
be a necessary: evil.

Similarly, he did not favor the
compulsory nature of the social
security system but “doubted”
that it was feasible to drop the
program now. He did lament the.
proposal to attach medicare to
the existing program with the
familiar cry of “overburdening”™
the existing setup.

Sounding another familiar
conservative tenet in the cof-
fee hour, Jonas opposed a high-
er minimum wage on the
grounds that it would stifle
economy.

In closing his assembly ad-
dress, Rep. Jonas made use of
a familiar monetary description.
“Ef you gave your wife one mil-
lion dollars to spend at a rate
of $1,000 a day, she wou!d be
back in three years for more
money: if you gave her one bil-
lion dollars. she wouldn't be
back for 300 years.”

If liberals took this as “ad-
vice on getting rid of one's
wife."’ conservatives tended to
wonder when they would next
see Lyndon Johnson after Janu- '
ary 20.
