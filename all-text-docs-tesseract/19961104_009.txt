-An Epiphany

Upon a recent Sunday morn-
ing perusal of The Charlotte Ob-
server, aheadline entitled, “‘Rules’
lead to the altar?” caught my eye.
Struck with curiosity, I read on to
find out which "Rules" the author
might be referring to and to which
particular altar these rules might
lead. The first sentences tell all:
“Are you single? Female? Always
looking for Mr. Right and finding
Mr. Wrong? That’s because you’re
not following ‘The Rules’.” Well,
thank goodness, I thought, finally
an answer to my gender’s perpetual
problems of love: a review of a
new, foolproof, how-to book

Stantly stimulate the congenital
male ambition by supplying men
with something todo. Female com-
pany means nothing unless pro-
vided in the face of adversity, akey
device used to hook a healthy hus-
band.

The article continues, giving
examples of the various rules that,
if properly followed, will guaran-
tee wedding bells to any subscriber.
The first rule commands that all
women adopt an attitude radiating
with a confidence that penetrates
the entirety of her very essence.
Specifically, a woman should be a

innocently initiated conversation
with many a man while conse-
quently writing ourselves'out of
their little black books for the trans-
gression. Additionally, Fein and
Schneider say that calling a man is
a definite no-no, and they frown
upon returning the calls of suitors,
for such response will undoubt-
edly insinuate a possible interest
on the part of the female and vio-
late the standards of gender inter-
action set forth by these two
women. Providing women sup-
press all self-assertion, previously
deemed beneficial to a healthy

making, subtitled, Time-Tested

ankind with key tricks of the
husband-catching trade.

lifestyle, that man could be
snagged. ;

When you’ re with a man
you like, be quiet and mysteri-
ous, act ladylike, cross your
legs and smile. Don’t talk too
much.” The value of a person-
ality is negligible in the dating
game, these women say.

We should halt all enjoy-

the number one mistake made
by women interested in marital
commitment is acting like it. “If
you want the man of your dreams
to marry you,” said the article,
“you must give up that liberated,
all-genders-are-equal nonsense for
an old-fashioned game of cat and
mouse. Men wanta challenge, not
- aninstant oreasy victory.” And all
this time I was led astray, foolishly
thinking that gender equality is-
sues, or “nonsense,” served impor-
tant and fulfilling functions in the
lives of the female sex.

Not if I wish to share that life
with anyone other than Ben and
Jerry, they say. My problem has
been thinking men and women are
equal. How silly of me. Menfolk
must be kept occupied with an
obstacle to overcome, otherwise
risking loss of attention span and
suppression of their inherent ani-
mal drives. Women must con-

“Creature Unlike Any Other,” a
veritable font of voluptuousness
and sensuality simply waiting to
hypnotize the opposite sex into lust
and desire for the exquisite female
form.

How blind we have been, be-
lieving that our own personalities
could ever suffice! To think that
the answer to the mystery of love
lies only as far as the acquisition of
anew aura plants a seed of hope in
the frustrated, forlorn gardens of
female love.

Furthermore, the authors al-
low neither talking to a man first,
nor initiating conversation of any

- form with said male, nor asking

that man for a dance. A woman
could “never make anything hap-
pen” anyway, say these authors, so
loitering sheepishly (yet coyly and
with an attitude) in the corner is the
best bet. Here again, we have

able company. But what really.

course; it’s all in the legs.
Finishing the article, I felt the
clouds lift above my former dating
naivete, and the light bulb of
epiphany flickeron above by head;
I realized exactly where the single
female population has gone wrong:
displaying ourselvesas intelligent,
communicative human beings.

Hail Professors

Picture it: you’ re sitting in the
middle of your lecture hall, sur-
rounded by 499 other students who
are all straining to hear the words
of the teacher’s assistant at the
front, who is, by the way, only two
years older than some of the people
in the class.

Your professor has only been
inclass three times since he handed
out the syllabus on the first day
(which he never did go over), and
each time you go by his office, his
assistant tells you that he is out
doing research.

Fortunately this scenariois not
a part of life at Davidson College.
The only time you’re in a room
with anywhere near 500 students
is during your freshman orienta-
tion. There are no words of wis-
dom sent by professors via teach-
ing assistants. And professors are

almost always available to deal
with your concerns.

Each week I scan The
Davidsonian articles and I see
many opinions about what’s wrong
with Davidson and what should be
changed, but I rarely see opinions
that praise the many things the
college does to benefit its students.
One of the things that the college
does is to provide for-us-professors
who are actually here to teach stu-
dents. They are not here simply to
take advantage of research facili-
ties that help them write their next
journal article or publish their next
book.

Many students probably take
for granted the many professors
who spend eight to ten hours a
week in their offices before and
after their classes while students
come in and out to talk about pa-

pers, presentations, reviews, and
majors.

They also spend a great deal
of time talking to students about
life in general: time management,
roommate situations, gender rela-
tions. One of my favorite profes-
sors is one whom I’ve never had
for a class, but who is still always
willing to listen to me recount my
successes and failures of the previ-
ous few weeks.

Davidson College students are
very lucky to have professors who
take an interest in students’ lives
inside and outside the classroom.
They are always willing to share
advice and resources, and they in-
volve themselves in student events.
It always feels good to know that
my professors actually know my
name and that I’m more that just
number 323 out of 500. .

Veterans are important

Ever since I came to
Davidson, I have always found
it strange that we never recog-
nize national holidays. But I
figured that this lack of recogni-
tion simply reflected Davidson’s
“commitment to education” and
our professors’ diehard insis-
tence that it would be impos-
sible for them to properly teach
their subjects if any of their class
time was taken away. To be
honest, I felt that the first expla-
nation was a valid one. So with
the exception of showing up toa
locked post office and realizing
it was one of those holidays, I
didn’t give the issue further
thought. That is, I didn’t give it
further thought until four weeks
ago. If you have been following

Veteran’s Day is a day that
was set aside to honor those men
and women who have risked and
often lost their lives defending our
country. This is a day that was set
aside to pay homage to those who
jeopardized everything so that we
might enjoy the lives and free-
doms wecurrently enjoy. And this
is a holiday that in its essence
crosses all racial, social, gender,
and religious bounds. It is a holi-
day that celebrates and thanks |
Americans for believing in what
America stands for, period. There
is no distinction between black,
white, male, female, Jew, or Chris-
tian on Veteran’s Day. We thank
the American soldier for fighting
for freedom. There is something
very much akin to what Dr. King

the SGA preachedin
meet- that.

changed. Starting two years
from now, afternoon classes will
be canceled for Martin Luther
King Day. In conjunction with
this half-holiday, the school will
sponsor an afternoon celebra-
tion (I believe this part is orga-
nized by COMA). Since classes
are canceled, the idea is that
students will be able to attend.

I think this is a great idea.

| Butit does pose some problems.

By giving students ahalf day off
for Martin Luther King Day
only, Davidson has, in essence,
elevated it above the other na-
tional holidays. I know that this
was not the intent, but it is the
result. From looking at the cal-
endar, Labor Day, President’s
Day, and Veteran’s Day are the
other national holidays that oc-
cur during the school year. I
will admit that I do not feel very
strongly about Labor Day. And
while I believe that some of the
presidents of this country de-
serve to be placed at least on the
same level with Dr. King, the
holiday I am most concerned
with is Veteran’s Day.

will be our banner and if one holi-
day is going to be recognized, all
national holidays will be recog-
nized. However, I believe that
Martin Luther King Day and
Veteran’s Day are different from
Labor Day and President’s Day.
The first set of holidays specifi-
cally remembers and honors people
living today (blacks and the civil
rights movement and veterans).

_The second set does not seem to do

this. So the resolution I will pro-
pose to the SGA will be that
Veteran’s Day alone be given treat-
ment equal to Martin Luther King
Day. This alleviates the problem
of devaluing Veteran’s Day and
balances the calendar by giving us
one national holiday each semes-
ter.

There is not much else to say.
We owe our veterans an incredible
debt. Without them, there is no
telling what condition our country
or our world would be in, It would
be an shame if we felt that we were
not able to make minor sacrifices
in our schedule so that we might
remember those who have sacri-
ficed so much for us.
