Texaco Dude Replies (Again)

To the Editors:

I find it outstanding that

The Davidsonian, as arepre-
sentative of a fine academic

"institution, would permit
‘publication of inaccuracies
and blatant falsities such as

were replete in Tosh Crys-

tal’s September 27 column,

“Hey Bob, Where’s My
Car?”

In regard to towing of
illegally parked vehicles, Mr.
Crystal apparently created
totally false statements and
masqueraded them as truth.

He stated , “I cornered
the towing dude at the Tex-
aco station down the street.
He said that the sinister force

| behind these heartless tow-
| ingsis ... Bob Collins.” This
| careless statement by Mr.

Crystal is unequivocally
untrue. In my estimation, no

} one at our Texaco was even

asked such a question, but if

tome, I ‘dreply justas I have
in the past, “our towing of
illegally parked vehiclesisa

| result of the total disregard

for rules and regulations by
a small percentage of stu-

| dents.”

_ Mr. Crystal continued,
“T talked to one girl whose
car door was damaged a good

the question: were directed ,

_ Otherwise,

deal by an overzealous cop ;

even parked illegally.”

The car in question was
simply moved backward
approximately three feet to
allow space for the installa-
tion of a new parking light.
There was no charge made
to the student.

Furthermore, the “good
deal of damage” mentioned
by misinformed Mr. Crystal
involved nothing more than
a small metal rod inside the
door slipping out of its plas-
tic holder. I personally re-
paired the door, again at no
costto the student. Mr. Crys-
tal’s incomplete research is
juvenile and worrisome.

Mr. Crystal continued
his misleading tirade; “I
personally saw these guys
tow acar despite the fact that
they couldn’t get the steer-

ing column unlocked. I’m —

sure that did wonders for the
car.” Sucha statement dem-
onstrates how totally delu-
ded Mr. Crystal has become.

While towing acar from
the front, the position of the
steering is irrelevant. How-
ever, while towing acar from
the rear, the steering must
absolutely remain locked.
the random
swaying back-and-forth of
the vehicle’s frontend would
wreak havoc upon every
parked car and pedestrian

y how . along the towing path. Why.
to use a slim-jim, but went —
| for it anyway. She wasn’t

on earth does Mr. Crystal
suppose we’dprefertotowa

vehicle with an unlocked
steering?

Tosh Crystal’s bizarre
comments became more and
more ludicrous as he contin-
ued, “A friend of mine saw
them lift up the end of a car
on the towing hitchand shake
it until the steering un-
locked.” This absurd statc-
ment honestly evoked a
snicker.

If, in some fit of ex-
hausted desperation during
a total lapse of mental co-
herence, we were to shake a
car vigorously until it regis-
tered an 8.5 on the Richter
scale, it would positively
have no bearing on the
locked steering column. And
again, we simply have no
reason to unlock that stecr-
ing.

Furthermore, after adili-

-gent search all over our tow

trucks, I’ve been quite un-
able to locate the lever la-
beled “shake.”

Attherisk of reiteration,
I must question the policy
and wisdom. of The
Davidsonian in publishing
Tosh Crystal’s slanderous
falsehoods. His careless
disregard for facts may eas-
ily prove a liability for your
paper.

Sincerely,

Lilly Defends Korner Pub

| to the -article

| To the Editors:

I would like to respond
in The
Davidsonian entitled,
“Korner Pub Exhibits Ra-
cism” (September 20, 1990).
The article, which was writ-

ten by a Sophomore, Kirby -
| Shealy, is not accurate in

certainly happy to sce.
Next, Kirby states that
“several students have been
denied service and asked to
leave because they did not
suite the owners’ standards.”
After engaging Alice in a
long conversation (as Kirby
obviously did not) I was
informed that she runs a

Individuals who go to

- the Pub other than Davidson

students may have views that
differ from Alice (and us) on
a varicty of things. But to
say that “the owners” are
racist is a perposterous no-
tion indeed. -

I suggest the next time
Kirby decides to pick on an

| several of its assumptions.

First of all, Kirby says

at Davidson for “many
years.” Had Kirby done
sufficientresearch before so

| eloquently putting pen: to
| paper he would have known

that the Pub has been an~
Antégratpartof the sociat life

business which does not
cater solely to the students
of Davidson College.

’ She also told me that she
has never asked a person to
leave nor has she refused to
serve someone, much. less

legal identification were

establishment he consider a
few things first: one, pick on
one that he can legally enter;
two, pick on one he thor-
oughly understands instead
of going strictly on hearsay;
three, pick on one that he
intends to be around for more
than four years of his life.

| that the Pub hasnot been the
| social hangout for Davidson —
} students for an outstanding ~
number of years.

“In fact, the Pub has just

recently: received the repu-
tation of a good place to go —
to relax with a game of pool.
and a few mugs of beer.

About seven years ago you’

would not find many

Davidson studentsat the Pub.
Since then, though, students.
have been going to the Pub -

‘in increasing numbers-- a
| tend the owner, Alice, is

presented. To quote the
owner, “I don’t care who:
comes inhereas long as they
behave themselves. One
man’s money is as good as
another’s.” The simple point
is that the Pub is a public es-
tablishment. Therefore, it
cannot pick and choose who

enters and exits its doors as

long as they are well be-
haved. I have been to the
Pub several times with mi-
norities and have ‘always

been served with them, no

questions asked,

Indeed, it is a bit unfair
to startcontroversy and then
leave thearea two years later.
Four, if he must pick on an
establishment and choose
racismas histopic then might

I suggest his state govern-

ment-- orhas he noticed that
the state of South Carolina
still flies the Rebel Flag high
atop its capitol? _
