Volleyball loses first five game match to Elon

Kittery Neale ’09 pave in a 3-2 win vs. Chattanoga on Oct. 23rd.

A senior and a rookie:
Runge makes impact

By WILL BRYAN

Thomas Runge ’06 just wanted to play
college tennis. In a school where nearly a
quarter of the student population plays a var-
sity sport, Runge has found an opportunity at
Davidson to live out his
dreams.

However,
gets one year.

Runge is a senior
walk-on on the men’s
tennis team in a place
where that rarely hap-
pens. “A lot of people
might not have tried out
if they only had a year
left,” Runge says. “But I‘
want to see how good I
can get.”

Runge says that he
did not start to play ten-
nis seriously until much
later than most varsity
players, who often start
playing youth tourna-
ments at a very young age. As a result, he
was not highly recruited coming out of high
school and decided to try to walk on at
Davidson, but as a freshman, Runge did not
make the team.’

“T did try out my freshman year, but I did-
n’t really have that clear of a purpose,” he
said. When he didn’t make the team, Runge
tried to stay sharp by practicing with the
girls’ team during his freshman year. Faced
with the large prospect of getting back on to
the team, Runge moved onto different things
the next two years and decided not-to con-
centrate on tennis.

Thomas Runge ’06 has walked on
to the men’s tennis team.

But there was something, however,
urgently pulling him back to the game that he
poured so many hours into. “I just couldn’t
stand watching the team from the sidelines,”
Runge said. “After all that time, you miss
playing a sport competitively and I felt that I
had to prove it to myself that I could put
forth the effort and com-
pete in a _ collegiate
match.”

Runge worked all sum-
mer and earned himself a
spot on a squad; the team
in turn has been impacted
by his sense of urgency.
“He plays like a guy with

his back against the
wall,” says teammate
Philip Compeau ‘08.

“But, for him there really
is no tomorrow.”

Runge’s first opportu-
nity on the court came
several weeks ago when
the tennis team hosted
several Southern
Conference opponents
during their mock fall schedule. Although he
dropped his two matches in _third-set
tiebreakers, Runge knows that the match
experience will continue to give him confi-
dence in preparation for the spring.

As both a senior and rookie at the same
time, Runge has the unique experience of
learning from the veterans while being a
leader through his sense of urgency and drive
to excel in his brief opportunity to play a col-
legiate sport. “I definitely feel like I am
working against a deadline, but as everyone
at Davidson can -attest, that comes with its
own special buzz.”

The volleyball team finished the week
with one win and two losses, coming out on
top 3-1 against Elon while falling 3-1 to
Appalachian State and 3-2 to UNC-
Greensboro.

Their overall record comes to 12-15 and

_ their SoCon record falls to 8-5.

On Wednesday, Oct. 26, the ’Cats took on
the Mountaineers of Appalachian State and
entered the game with confidence, getting an
early lead and pressuring the Mountaineers
who had an impressive 9-2 SoCon record.
Tierney Hodge ’09, in the early stages of the
game, hit two aces on her serve to help put
Davidson ahead.

Winning the first game with a narrow mar-
gin of 30-28 on a kill by Kate Pierucci ’08,
the Wildcats hoped to put an end to
Appalachian State’s win streak of six, but
they did not succeed.

The Mountaineers pulled ahead of the
*Cats in the next three games with scores of
19-30, 7-30, and 25-30. In the fourth game,
Davidson put up a fight in a desperate
attempt to force a fifth, tying it up twice, but
the opposition proved too strong.

Three days later, the Wildcats took to the
court again, this time at Elon in their second
match against the Phoenix. After trailing the
*Cats by as many as six points in the first
game, the Phoenix brought the game to with-
in one point at 21-20. Undaunted, Liz
Williamson ’07 pounded three kills to put the
first game away 30-22.

In the second game, Davidson and Elon
again fought neck-and-neck for the win.
Tying it up at 29-29, the Wildcats then fell
behind and eventually took the 31-29 loss
after a kill and service ace put up by the

Phoenix.

Hodge led the way in kills in the third
game with six, including the game winner,
helping to bring the Wildcats up 30-20, and
they finished the night in tight fourth game
33-31. Again, Hodge drovd home a kill, her
10th, to win it.

Davidson next faced UNC-Greensboro on
Sunday and lost in five games, ending their
6-0 win streak in matches going into a fifth
game. Three Wildcats—Pierucci, Hodge,
and Williamson—finished the night with
double-digits in the kills department, but
their efforts were not enough. ;

The Wildcats won the first game of the
match with a score of 30-22 with the final
point coming off of Williamson’s service
ace.

The second game got away from the ’Cats
who fell behind by as many as seven points.
On a late surge, they got the game within two
points at 27-25 but could not catch up all the
way. The Spartans’ Lauren Richards finished
the game with a kill to put UNC-G on top 30-
26.

In the third game, Davidson and UNC-G
started out closely on the scoreboard, with
the difference in points never exceeding four
until Davidson got the lead 23-19. They held
the Spartans to 19 points to bring the game to
a 30-19 finish to go up two games to one.
Davidson could not hold its lead.

After falling 19-30 in the fourth game, the
Wildcats hoped to continue their win streak
in five-game matches; however, they never
got the lead in the fifth game and fell 15-10,
their fifth loss to a SoCon team on the sea-
son.

Away for the next two games, the Wildcats
will face College of Charleston on Saturday,
Nov. 5 and The Citadel on Nov. 6, each with
a 2 p.m. start time.
