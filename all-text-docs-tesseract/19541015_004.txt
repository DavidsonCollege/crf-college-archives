M/SGT. MOODY SOWELL

Master Sergeant Moody Sowell.
Supply Sergeant of the Davidson
College R.O.T.C. Headquarters, en-
listed in the army in 1939 at Char-
lotte, N. C.

He was stationed at Ft. Bragg
with the 17th Field Artillery unti)
1940, at which time he was trans-
ferred to the 29th Field Artillery
Battalion of the 4th Infantry Divis-
ion, stationed at Ft. Benning, Ga.
During the early part of World
War Il, this unit was retained at
Ft. Benning as an artillery demon-
stration group for the Infantry
School.

In 1943, Sgt. Sowell returned to
Ft. Bragg, where he was a member
of the newly-organized 798th Field
Artillery Battalion, a testing sec-
tion for the Field Artillery Board.
Sowell’s main job there was instru-
ment operator for the “center of
impact” tests on various types of
ammunition.

When this battalion was sent
overseas, Sgt. Sowell remained at
Ft. Bragg and was made First Ser-
geant in the 560th Field Artillery
Battalion. In June, 1945, this bat-
talion was broken up, and Sowell
went to the 780th Field Artillery.
This group soon was converted to
a 4.211 chemical mortar battalion.
Sowell and other members of the
battalion were sent to the Edge-
wood Arsenal ‘in Maryland for a
six weeks orientation course.

Shortly after the war, after the
mortar battalion had been deacti-
vated, Sgt. Sowell re-enlisted in
the army with the 30th Field Ar-
tillery Battalion, where he was
First Sergeant in Headquarters
Battery. After several months, he
went to Gorzia, Italy for occupa-
tion duty, where he remained un-
til January, 1947.

Sgt. Sowell returned to Ft. Bragg
and remained there until 1949,
when he departed for Japan. He
was assigned to Headquarters of
24th Infantry Division at Camp Ko-
kura, where he served as post Sgt.
Major.

This position was retained until
February, 1951, when Sowell de-
parted for Korea as chief clerk in
the G-1 section of 24th Infantry Di-
vision. He returned to the United
States in November, 1951.

After a short leave, M/Sgt. So-
well was sent to Davidson College,
where he has served in various ca-
pacities. At the present time, he is
Supply Sergeant. Sowell must com-
plete a tour of duty overseas be-
fore his retirement from the army
in 1950; therefore, he expects to
leave Davidson at the end of this
school year.

M/Sgt. Sowell is presently resid-
ing on Concord St., with his wife
and two children.

David F. Sauer Works
Currently Displayed
in Chambers Lobby

Concurrent with the concert of
the American Chamber Orchestra
an exhibition of paintings by
David F. Sauer will be held in the
lobby of Chambers building, Mr.
Douglas Houchens has announced.

Sauer, a native of Richmond
Virginia, received his B.F.A. de-
gree from the Richmond Profes-
sional Institute, and his M.A. from
Teachers’ College, Columbia Uni-
versity. Painting since he was
nine, he works in oil, tempera,
casein, encaustic, watercolor, and
the graphic mediums.

David Sauer had his first solo-

show last spring at the Salpeter
Gallery on New York's 57th
Street. His works have elicited
high critical praise for “Bright-
keyed, glowing color,” expressing
“an appreciable lyricism.” The
New York Times commented on
his work, "The flowers in David
Sauer’s hedonistic paintings . -
bloom with bright colors of a
Fauve eloquence.” Art News re-
marks on the French influence in
his work, and the Herald Tribune
speaks of his depiction of “all the
things that speak of a joy of liv-
ing.”

wishes him to take the Admission

With Mr. Donald Plott direct-
ing, the Davidson Male Chorus
commenced what promised to be
one of its best seasons last Sun-
day night at Vespers. The richness
of their performance impressed
many who attended the service
and was the topic for much favor-
able comment on-the campus.

Composed of thirty-six well
blended voices, the chorus shows
signs of richer tonal intonation, a
more melodic line, and a more
buoyant spirit for doing good mu-
sic well than has any other group
prior to this year’s team of mu-
sicians.

Their scheame 18 more greatly
varied also. The schedule of the

Chorus will include concerts in
the states of Louisiana, Texas, and
in other Southwestern points. If
the group’s director is able to
arrange a contract with an airline
agency to fly the Chorus to Mex-
ico for several concerts, the
group hopes to sing below the
border will be realized.

Several appearances with the
Charlotte Symphony are planned.
At these appearances the Chorus
will perform numbers with the
Symphony, with famous guest so-
loists, and alone. Aside from spe-
cial numbers of greater than aver-
age interest, the group will per-
form at their concerts music of
religious nature and classical

from North Carolina A. and T.
After completing the firing of
the matches, Littlejohn, along with
several other members of the
team, traveled through part of

ant in the Davidson College Re-
serve Officers Training Corps and
serves as the executive officer of

round out. their programs.

These appearances will further
assist the Chorus to bring to the
public the very best in choral mu-
sic.
