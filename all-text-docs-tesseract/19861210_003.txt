Wednesday, December 10, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Weekend exposes other side of life |

By LUCIA KENDALL

Editor's Note: Lucia Kenall
participated in the Chapel Com-
mittee-sponsored . Awareness
Weekend last weekend, along with
two dozen other students, working
in the poorest section of Char-
lotte.

The purpose of-the weekend I
spent in Charlotte, according to

College Chaplin Charlie Sum- *

mers, was “to sensitize Davidson
students to the problems people
face in the inner city. We also
want to introduce them to differ-
ent kinds of urban Christian
ministry. I feel this is an experi-
ence in learning compassion.”

We stayed at Christ the King
Center in Optimist Park, the sec-
tion of Charlotte with the lowest
income and the highest crime rate.
We spent Friday evening gettting
to know each other through a
series of icebreakers and games
followed by some discussion
about our work, then goofing
around for a while.

Saturday morning we divided
into work groups for the day. I
helped make soup for a soup
kitchen run by Woody Wood at
the Salvation Army Center, where

over 50 people come in every Sun-
day for a hot meal. Wood said that
although some of the people who
come in are young and just too
lazy or unmotivated to find a job,
most of them are unable to find
work, either because they are too
old, or blind, or mentally re-

-tarded.

Afterward, 1 did some repair.
work at Siegle Avenue Presbyte-
rian Church, a small building for a
total of 50 members (It’s not
DCPC). Our group worked on the
lock on their door, hung banners
and across, put a new wall in their
bathroom, filled a hole in the
parking lot with concrete, and”
painted a cabinet.

Later, Libby, the woman in
charge of the church’s Christian.
Education took me to visit a mem-
ber of the congregation who had
broken her ankle. Seeing her
apartment was the first time I had
ever been inside a low-income
housing project. I had expected it

- to be small, although it was still

hard for me to realize an entire
family lived in a place already so
cluttered I had a hard time walking
between the furniture. What I was

Beyond Davidson

Iran problem deepens,

not prepared for was the smell that
resulted from too many people in
not enough space. In the summer,
when the temperature can get
above 100 degrees outside, I can
hardly imagine what it must ‘be
like.

The woman was delighted to

see us and very cheerful the whole -

time we were there, which made
me ashamed about my own comp-
laining and grumpiness when my
life isso much easier.

After lunch (which included a
wonderful grilled cheese by Joe
Thomas) | and Mercedes, a girl
from Costa Rica who is living
with Charlie’s family, went to
rake leaves for an old woman in
the community. After we finished
the front yard she invited us in for
a snack. She was friendly and ap-
preciative of our coming over, and
told us how glad she was that God
has blessed her. Before we left she
gave both of us a very strong bear
hug.

Later, Richard Banks, the di-
rector of Christ the King told me
that her husband, who had been “a
cantankerous fellow; you could
never do anything to make him

happy” had died recently. Also,
several months ago when two men
were fighting on the street, one of
them shot at the other, but missed,
and instead hit her son, who was
just walking out of a store. Not
long after that he died. She had
told me that God had gotten her
through some hard times, but I
had no idea what she had been
through.

After dinner we had a chance
to talk as a group about the day’s
activities, then those of us who
didn’t go back to Davidson went
to a movie. Sunday morning we
had a Bible study, then went to the
service at Siegle Avenue, led by
our own Charlie Summers.

All the people who went on
the trip were glad they did. In fact,
two people have decided to go
back and help serve in the soup
kitchen again.

Freshman Therese .Gyauch
said, “The weekend really lived
up to its name. It was areal growth
experience. I was impressed by
the sense of community in the
people we met. They may not
have a lot of material possessions,
but they do have something very

Paris riots injure 68

special.”

“It was a good experience be-
cause it showed we're all just
people and we all need to help
each other,” said senior Forrest
Bowen.

Freshman Drury Carr com-
mented, “It gives you an aware-
ness about poverty-stricken |
people and opens your eyes to the
world outside of Davidson. It also
makes you realize that doing
things to help people will make a
difference.”

One major illustration of the
work of the people in Optimist
Park is their reaction to a situation
in which the city council planned
to build a major highway through
the center of the neighborhood,
thus getting rid of “the bad section
of town.” The community got to-
gether and decided to propose an
alternate route and back it up with
reasons why it would work. They
found another place for the high-
way, and the city council adopted
their plan. As Richard Banks said,
“It shows you what people can do
without much education and with-
out much money, but with a lot of
hard work and dedication.”

Around the World —

As information about the Reagan ad-
ministration’s controversial sale of arms
to Iran and the channeling of profits to
Nicaraguan rebels continued to be dis-
closed, House and Senate leaders moved

to establish Watergate-style committees

to investigate the situation. Both former

National Security Adviser John Poindex-
ter and Lt. Col. Oliver North invoked the
Fifth Amendment right against self-in-
crimination and refused to testify about
their involvement in the arms sales.

But White House spokesmen said
North had written a chronicle of the oper-

ation which omits significant details of

the program and is believed to have

“lied” to Poindexter and White House

Chief of Staff Donald Regan when ques-
tioned about a November 1985 arms
shipment by Israel. Administration offi-
cials also reported that Poindexter had
urged Reagan to resurne arms sales to
Iran after the President had decided to
stop the shipments'in December 1985.

Congressional lawyers advised the
House and Senate that Reagan and his
aides may have violated five provisions
of the Arms Export Control Act by sell-
ing weapons to Iran: Reagan for the first
time admitted he had made mistakes in
executing his policies but denied he had
tried to swap arms for hostages and said
he was not fully informed of the diversion
of profits to the contras.

Headlining the news for the week Dec. 3-

tras last symmer. Administration offi-
cials said this money was funneled
through a Swiss bank account adminis-
tered by North. Shultz also complained
that the White House had established sec-
ret communications with U.S. Ambas-
sador to Lebanon John Kelly on negotia-
tions for release of the hostages. Shultz
also identified retired Air Force General
Richard Secord as a central figure in the
Administration’s secret diplomacy with
Tran. ,

At least 59 Iraqis were killed and 100
wounded as Iranian forces shelled Basra,
Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on the
oil center of Ahwaz. Iraq then attacked
power plants in the Iranian towns of Arak
and Kanjwar and military bases in central
Iran. .

In a search for Nicaraguan rebels, at
least 1,000 Sandinista troops crossed the
Honduran border, wounded three Hon-
duran guardsmen, and captured two
others. President Reagan authorized

U.S. army helicopters to airlift Honduran —

troops into action against the Nicaraguan
forces, at the request of Honduran Presi-
dent Jose Hoyo.

In Paris at least 68 people were in-
jured and one was killed in demonstra-
tions by hundreds of thousands of stu-
dents against legislation proposed by the
French government to overhaul the coun-
try’s educational system. French Presi-
dent Jacques Chirac, citing “risks of vio-
lence,” surrendered to the protesters and
withdrew the legislation.

Thousands of Hindus rampaged

Former_ National Security Adviser_—through the streets of New Delhi, India,

Robert McFarlane testified that Reagan
had approved the selling of arms by Israel
ito Iran in September 1985 as a'means to
seek release of hostages and opening
dialogue with Iran.

Secretary of State George Shultz con-
firmed that he had persuaded sultan Has-
sanal Bokiah of Brunei to supply millions
of dollars of arms to the Nicaraguan con-

in protest of the Sikh massacre of 22 Hin-
dus in Punjab state last week. Police
made over 1,500 arrests. Meanwhile,
thousands of torch-carrying people
marched through Bhopal, India; in a pro-
test parade marking the second anniver-
sary of the Union Carbide gas leak that
killed 2,347 persons.
Egyptian prosecutors charged four

military officers and 29 civilians with at-
tempting to organize a Moslem holy war
to topple the government of President
Hosni Mubarak.

South African President P.W. Botha
apparently has pressured the country’s
Newspaper Press Union thto harsher self-
censorship and strong measures enforc-
ing press restrictions. The South African
government also acknowledged that chil-.
dren between the ages of 11 and 15 are
being detained without trial under the na-
tion’s emergency decree. Honeywell,
Inc. and Revlon Group, Inc. announced
plans to sell operations :in South Africa.

\
As Arab demonstrations against Is-

raeli occupation of the West Bank con- -

tinued, Israeli troops shot and wounded
six Palestinians there. Meanwhile, a
cease-fire in Lebanon disintegrated less
than 24 hours after taking effect, as pales-
tinian guerrillas resumed fighting with
Shiite Moslem militiamen in Beirut and
southern Lebanon.

The Reverend Jesse Jackson in
Tokyo said he would encourage an
American boycott of Japanese products
unless Japanese corporations begin
awarding more dealerships, franchises,
and advertising contracts to American
minority business interests.

Across ‘the Nation —

President Reagan appointed Frank
Carlucci, a former deputy director of the
C.1.A, and a former deputy defense sec-
retary, to replace Admiral John Poindex-
ter as his national security adviser. Car-
lucci is Reagan’s fifth national security
adviser in six years. White House
spokesman Larry Speakes announced his
resignation to take a $250,000 a year job

Representative Jim Wright (D.-
Texas) was chosen to be the new speaker
of the House. Wright immediately pro-
posed a delay in tax cuts for higher-in-
come taxpayers to help balance the fed-
eral budget. Thomas Foley (D.-

Washington) was elected to replace
Wright as majority leader, and Tony
Coelho (D.-California) was. elected
majority whip

‘Meanwhile, Robert Michel (R.-II-
linois) was reelected as House minority
leader, and Trent Lott (R.-Mississippi)
was reelectéd minority whip.

Newly disclosed documents showed
that NASA Administrator James
Fletcher, who awarded the contract to
Morton Thiokol for the design of the
Challenger’s ill-fated booster rockets, |
had personal interests in the in contract.
Senator Albert Gore, Jr. (D.-Tenn.) said
the new-information warranted a Con-
gressional investigation into the contract
for the award.

Scientists said they have taken an im- |
portant step in developing an AIDS vac-
cine by showing that only a fragment of
protein from the AIDS virus is necessary
for developing anti-bodies against it.

In Economic Headlines —

Yeutter announced the appointment of
Commerce Department trade official-
William Houston III as chief U.S. textile
negotiator for the White House. Treasury
Secretary James Baker signalled that the
White House has ended its threats to veto
any trade legislation approved by Con-
gress and will work with Congress to
“craft reasonable legislation.”

Agriculture Department forecasters
said farm income and agricultural exports
should improve next year, and consum-
ers will experience a modest increase in
food prices.

dreds of American-based companies con-
tinue-to trade with Libya despite the
Reagan administration’s economic sanc-
tions imposed on the country last Janu-
ary.
