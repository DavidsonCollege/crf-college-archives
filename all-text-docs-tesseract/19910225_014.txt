By Peter Hurtado

The men’s track and field team
closed its most successful indoor
season ever this past Saturday at
the Best Western Invitational at
Virginia Tech. The men enter the
outdoor season ready to rewrite
the record books.

Senior John Moss led the way
for the Wildcats with a spectacular
performance of 15:55.4 in the
5000m run, placing 5th overall.
This is the 3rd fastest 5|000m time
in Davidson history; look for John
to carry this success into his final
outdoor season.

Freshman Rob King improved
his distance in the shot put to an
outstanding 39’7 1/4", placing 4th.

Freshman William Presson
continued his success in the triple
jump, placing 6th with a sensa-
tiojump of 41’9 1/2". This repre-
sents the second-best triple jump
in Davidson history.

Another Freshman, DJ
Ruggles, turned ina fine perform-
ance in the triple jump of 39" 4 1/

2". Presson (20’13/4")and Ruggles
(193 1/4")also had great perform-
ances in the long jump.

In distance events, milers
David Kerns (4:34.4) and Cam
Dauler (4:35.9) closed their indoor
season with personal bests for the
mile.

Peter Hurtado (9:11) and Ian
Stewart (9:13) paced each other to
personal bests in the 3000m run.
Freshman Richard Wharton ran a
promising 3000m of 9:35 to close
his indoor season.

Freshmen Duncan Spears
(52.9) and. David Stewart (53.7)
led the way with strong perform-
ances in the 400m run. Both David
and Duncan have had outstanding

‘indoor seasons and should con-

tinue to impress in the outdoor
Season.

Also, in the 400m, Sam Patter-
son (56.3) and William Bobo (59.1)

ran strong as they gear up for the "

outdoor season. The return of Mike
Grant from. injury should bolster
the 400m corps.

In sprints, Freshmen Wendell
Robbins (6.78) and DJ Ruggles
(6.90) continue to run great times
for the 55m dash. Both men add
the speed that has been absent from
Davidson track squads for several
years.

Though absent from the final
meet, captain Ted Richardson has
highlighted the Wildcats season.
Ted has established himself as the
top middle-distance runner in re-
cent memory at Davidson with

sensational performances this
winter in the mile, 3000m, and
5000m.

Strengthened by several out-
standing freshmen, the men’s team
has never looked so strong in so
many events.

_ This. year’s squad looks to".

surpass the milestone perform-
ances of last year’s team this spring.

tional on Saturday, March 9th.

ginia Tech. Touching off a season

efforts from the entire squad.

Heather Tarpley highlighted
the team’s performance with her
6th place finish in the 400m (62.4),

Reynolds(11:50) paced each other
to excellent times in the 3000m.

corded by Davidson women in re-

cent years; and bode well for the
coming outdoor season.

400m (70.1), and in the*200m
(31.1).

est women ever for both events.

by. more than eleven points at
halftime, he commented that “they
hit the quick points and we did
not.” This was true for Davidson in
last Saturday’s game at Winthrop
and was in effect Wednesday night.

McKillop was pleased to see
such a strong showing from the
student body in terms of noise and
support. “The fans were great,” he
said. “The support factor has been

absent in the transition from
Johnston Gym to the Baker Sports
Complex. I’mdelighted tosee them
here and I think it made our players
play to the intensity they are ca-
pable of. Tonight, there was a more
intimate atmosphere.”

The win pushed Davidson’s
record to 6-8 in the Big South and
8-18 overall.

Also, Davidson is guaranteed
a final finish in the Big South of no
worse than fifth place.

Davidson Soccer
Receives Honors,
Gains Credibility

By. Tom Price .

The Davidson soccer team en-
joyed its best season ever and re-
ceived a slew of awards for its
efforts during 1990.

Heading the listof post-season
award recipients is junior Rob
Ukrop, who was named second
team All-American by the National
Soccer Coaches Association of
Americaafter scoring 22 goals and
12 assists. Rob’s 22 goals made
him the nation’s third leading
scorer, Sel ame

Seniors Peter Cobb and Ross

Saldarini joined Ukrop as All-—

South Region team choices. Both
Ukrop and Cobb were selected to
the firstteam, while Saldarini w

Charlie Slagleasthe South Region. <

Coach of the Year, This award is
particularly impressive since the
South Region features the major-
ity of the Atlantic Coast. Confer:
ence schools ioe: ‘ther quality
teams.

Sopa Matt Rage be-

: lieves that this was a particularly

meaningful award because the
South “has the most talent” and
Coach Slagle “doesn’t even have
an assistant coach.”

Last year’s record of 15-7-2,
given that it came against tough
Division I competition, has given
Davidson credibility and anational
reputation. The fact that the team

‘achieved such success against
~- teams which often had scholarship

players makes it even more re-
markable.

Coach Slagle contends. that

mostcollegeteams‘‘knew wecould

play,” but that now news of the
_ program has spread “‘into the high
schools.” He therefore expects last’ .

tive results i in the ie ier: sage

Talented new recruits and

improved play by the returning '
_ players. will be necessary. to re-
~ place the loss'of seniors Saldarini, ’

Cobb and goalkeeper Scott Zucker.
Saldarini and Zucker anchored the
defense last season and their lead-
ership will be sorely missed.
Slagle says that junior Doug
Long “will be ready” to step in and
replace Zucker as goalkeeper. He
also feels that a pair of i incoming
freshmen should. be able to help

out there.

Saldarini’s steady play will be
difficult to replace, but current
freshmen Ben Hayes and Ed Den-
ning will help keep the defense
strong. And Spear, a two year
starter, promises that “the defense
will be back.”

The sheer speed of Peter Cobb
may be.the most difficult element
for the team to replace. His explo-
siye play resulted in 12 goals and 8

Spear admits that last year’s
success will create “tremendous
pressure to repeat:” Nonetheless,
the team is confidentthat 1991 will

_ be an even better year.

Ukrop states that the team’s
primary goal for next season is to

Obviously, both goals will be
difiicult to achieve, and Slagle in-

means to attaining these goals.

The Wildcats will play a lim-
ited spring schedule: against sev-
