Social System
Works Up To Pa r

In. an exclusive interview
with ‘THE DAVIDSONIAN,

Davidson College President

Samuel R.. Spencer has indi-
cated that the college’s new
social system is working as
well as can be expected.
“T wouldn't say that the
new social system is a fail-
ure at all,’’ Spencer said.
“The over-all plan submit-
ted by the Committee of
Eighteen is very .good.

“The problems which
exist,’ he continued, ‘are
those of working through the
mechanics of the system,
changing from the old 40 the
new. There are bound‘to be

imperfections in such a
change.”’

(Regarding «the recent
change in the method of

house assignment by Dean
of Students Will H. Ter-
ry, Spencer said that such
an alteration ‘‘indicates that
any transition will have
some difficulties. Some
things, such as the method
of assignment, are done by
trial and error.

“We realize that we should
have done a better prepara-

tion job at the houses to ~

provide a system whereby
the freshmen would be more
welcomed.” :

Spencer emphasized ~that

the ‘problems of the transi-
tional year are different and

more difficult from the over- ’

all problems of’ the new so-
cial system. Everyone ex-
pected this to be the most
difficult time.”

The existing social system
was approved by the Board
of Trustees in its fall meet-
ing, and was first instituted
following the Christmas va-
cation. According to the col-
lege administration, it will
be fully operative next fall.
The present social system
“replaced: the old selective
fraternity system.

Regarding the trustee de-~

cision, Spencer. said that ‘‘I
‘don’t? think that ‘there is
much chance of the trustees
going back on their decision.
Of course, I don’t speak for
them."’

Terry stated, ‘‘The obser-

have already servéd their
junior year do not approach
the job with the same zeal
as juniors.

Our feedback -
from senior hall ‘counselors

confirms this.

“It is our general impres-
sion that seniors, very right-
ly, have their minds on
other things, namely grad-
uate school, plans to get
married, the army—all the
things seniors would like to
get ready for next year.

“Also, many seniors would
rather use their spring term
to be with their friends in
the senior class who they've
known for four years and
won't see again, rather
than being tied to other re-
sponsibilities.’’ ‘

When questioned on the

new policy, Mrs. Scotty Nic-

holls, director of student
housing, said that it was
‘primarily on the recom-
mendation and performance
of seniors who have served
in the past.”’

Mrs. hols remarked
that the new policy would

not affect the quality of the

counselors selected, since
most applications ; come
from rising juniors anyway.
“It is rare to have a senior
applying who. wasn’t apply-
ing for a second time.”

‘When viewing his second :

year in ‘the job, senior
counselor Alan Kirkpatrick
said, ‘‘The . only advantage
to a senior is in the experi-
ence he has had.

“The disadvantage is that
you lose a lot of enthusiasm
between the first and. second
year, and with that enthusi,

asm, you lose some things _

helpful and necessary,”

“Y’ve already received

calls and letters from num-
erous. alumni who stand be-
hind me, and many students
have told me that they. want
to do anything they. can to
help.”

A form letter was sent
out this week to Davidson
Students, faculty, trustees,
and to the 51 presidents of
college alumni associations.
In addition, other. copies
were mailed to the Charlotte
Observer, the Charlotte
News, WSOC, and WBTV.

DuRant feels that one of
the worst facets of this situa-
tion is the role of the SGA
in selecting Davis as a
speaker. “It's bad enough
that we're paying him
$1,000, but it’s, even worse
that the SGA never thought
about other students.”’

His next move is to collect
the required 100s signatures
necessary for a referendum
and then to confront the stu-

‘dent Senate.

“Hopefully there will be
enough pressure applied by
alumni, trustees, faculty, and
this petition to influence the
new senate to reconsider.”

DuRant added that, ‘‘There
will be some form of protest,
peaceful of course, against
his presence if the lecture
is not cancelled.” He said
the demonstrators will pro-
bably wear coats and ties.

Mounts Anti-Davis Drive

Newly-installed. SGA Pre-
sident Danny Clodfelter com-
mented: “If a petition is
brought, then we'll see what
the senate will want. to do,
but as of ‘now Davis is com-
ing on March 1. Thére is no
way we can please every-
body on the speakers we
choose.”

Clodfelter added, ‘‘The
senate discussed the matter
fully before . voting. 11-2 to
bring him_ here, and a ceil-
ing of $1,000 was set.” He
said that the rumor about
Davis speaking at the Uni-
versity of Squth Carolina for-.
$500 was completely false.

‘Coldfelter also. commented
on the current wave of stu-
dent petitions: ‘We will run
referendums, but I wonder
why so many turn out to
vote and then turn around
and ‘assume that these peo-
ple they have elected are
not fit to represent them.”
