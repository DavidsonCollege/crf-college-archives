those who come in contact with
life to make money, be sure you are

going at it in the right spirit before
it is too late. There has been a
gradual change in the past few years
in the questions asked about a rich
man. Before the war, the question
was simply “How much?” A man
used to be respected for the mere
fact that he had money. During the
war the question was changed to
“How did you get it?” and now it
is “Why did you get it—what are
you going to do with it?” The
world is in need of help, and this is
no time.for a man to selfishly hoard
all he can get. The world is calling
for courageous, unselfish men. Pre-
pare yourself for that call.
