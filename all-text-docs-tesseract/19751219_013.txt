Parker observ erves from stands

Early bouts decide match

Last Friday night the Dav-
idson wrestling team began its
regular, season for the first
time in forty years without
Coach Charlie Parker on the
bench.

With Coach Parker watch-
ing from the stands, though,
the Wildcat Grapplers put
together a string of five con-
secutive victories to build an
insurmountable 27-5 lead over
the Livingstone College Bears,
who were unable to catch up
and ended up losing to the
Wildcats 27-19.

The Cats started the match
with a 6-0 lead as Ted Mumby
won by forfeit in the 118-
pound class. In the 126-pound
bout Brian Jacobs lost’ the
decision to a wrestler who
pinned him in last year’s
Davidson-Livingstone con-
test.

Jacobs was the last David-
son wrestler to lose until the
177-pound class. Glenn Ball-
ard began the string of vict-
ories with a 5-3 decision, and
freshman Pat Dulany added
three more points to the
scoreboard with his 11-6 tri-
umph.

In the 150-pound bout, Mark
Scandling pinned his opponent
early in the third period; this
pin was worth six team points
and put the Cats out in front
18-5.

Bob Price, wrestling after
only a week of practice, hung
on to win his match 9-6. Senior
Ralph Holloway, who was

winning by points in the
167-pound match, was given
the contest when his opponent
was forced to default due to

‘ severe leg cramps. This vict-

ory secured the match for the
Wildcats, for even with three
matches still to be wrestled
there was not any way the
Cats could lose.

Radar pleased

Rader was ‘‘extremely
pleased with the performance
of his lower and middle weight
wrestlers” and he felt “the
strength of the team was
indicated by the fact that the
match was won after only
seven bouts.”

Former star Weicker

_ By BILL WINKENWERDER

Former Davidson College
standout -athlete George
Weicker returned to his alma
mater this past weekend to
visit old friends and team-

: mates after finishing his first

term of graduate school in
education at Johns Hopkins
University.

Weicker was a two sport
star last year for the Wildcats,

playing linebacker in football
' and making First Team

Coaches All-America as desig-
nated hitter in baseball, and is
currently playing in the Cinci-
natti Reds’ farm system after
signing as a free agent fol-
lowing graduation last spring.

The credentials that earned
Weicker his All-American
berth were outstanding: 452

Livingstone took the final
three matches of the evening
as Scott Phillips, Ray Berber-
ick and Jack Summe were all
defeated by their Bear oppo-
nents. Rader was not too
upset with his upper weight
men because, as he said,
“Livingstone was‘ strongest in
their upper weights;’”’ he ad-
ded, though, that ‘‘he hoped
for some improvement by his
big men in upcoming mat-
ches.”’

The Grapplers now face a
one-month layoff over to
Christmas break. Their next
match is not until January 17,

when they must face VMI,

Elon, and The Citadel in a
four-way meet.

batting average--2nd in the
NCAA, 10 home runs, 44 runs
batted in, MVP for Davidson
and MVP in the Southern
Conference.

Strangely he was not
drafted by a major league
team. “I was a little sur-
prized,” he mused, ‘‘but all I
wanted was a chance to play
professional ball and I got it. I
was just glad to sign as a free
agent, although a big bonus
would have been nice.”

Sights set on majors

During his visit Weicker
indicated that his career in
professional baseball has got-
ten off to a fine start; he
reported to the Reds’ Class A
rookie league team in Billings,
Montana in June, 1975, and
left in August having finished
the season with a .311 batting
average, tops for his team,
and had 7 home runs, 50 runs
batted .in and a Pioneer
League record of 24 doubles.

His home run total placed
him second among all league
players, and his .311 batting
average put him in sixth place.
He was also named Most
Valuable Player for his team.

As a result of his strong
performance, Weicker will re-
port to Cincinatti’s spring
training camp in Tampa, Flo-
rida the first week in March.
Before he goes, however, he

son working out with Palmer
Meunch’s Widcat baseball
team. ‘I am doing this pri-
marily to. get in top shape
before I report, but I also hope
to coach a little and help out
the hitters.’’

When asked about the level
of competition in professional
baseball, Weicker stated, ‘‘I
really was not overly im-
pressed or awed by the players
I played with or against. The
pitching was somewhat better
than I had seen in college, and
there were some talented indi-
viduals, but I surely did not
feel outclassed.”

Most Valuable Player

It is obvious when talking
with “‘Quasar,’’ as he is called
by his former teammates, that
his sights are set on the major
leagues. He is patient about
the future, however, and he
appears willing to work his

way up through the minor
league system.

“I hope to be playing with
the Reds number one A divi-
sion team this coming summer
and then with their AAA team
the next year,’ he added.

“There are a lot of good
young players in the minor
leagues, and I may just have
to wait for my chance. The
whole system is geared to
weeding out people who don’t
want it badly enough. We will
just have to see what hap-

will spend six weeks at David- pens.”
