True you have had it very cold
Just the same as we have had;
The story is only half told,
Our winter up here was bad.

I would love to meet you all
Down South in Davidson again;
It might be by next fall,
Here’s where I’ll have to remain.

concerned gains 1-2 point. This
same system of scoring is used for
the two other golfers in the four-

be earned. Then the best ball in
the foursome also gets three points,
the top golfer in the first nine get-
ting 1 point and also in the second
as well as in the whole match. The
total is 9 points. If there are 3
foursomes playing, a total of 27
