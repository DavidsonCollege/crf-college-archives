Hurricane

Hugo!

The Davidsonian
Wednesday, October 11, 1989

This huge tree in front of Little dorm stood no chance with Hugo,
which snapped it virtually in half. About 231 trees were damaged or
felled.

Hurricane pounds campus:
$400,000 in tree damage

Hugo’s signs are still on campus

The signs of Hurricane
Hugo's devastating visit are
still present in Davidson three
weeks after it ravaged the
Carolinas. Stories of how one
survived Hugo are still being
told and will be repeated for a
long time. Students will for-
ever remember the unexpected
holiday from classes.

The force of reported 87 mile
per hour winds strewed the
campus with debris and
downed 231 trees, some of
them more than 100 years old.
The majority of them have now
been cleared, and Davidson's
campus definitely has a barer
look.

The dollar value of damages
suffered by the college has not
yet been determined, accord-
ing to Grover Meetze, director
of facilities planning. The value
of trees is more than $400,000,
at $2,000 per tree.

The hurricane devastated the
Caribbean islands before tear-
ing Charleston, S.C. Meteor-

ologists misjudged the time of
the storm's arrival in Charlotte
by approximately eight hours.

“No one could have pre-
dicted that [the storm],” said
Will Terry, dean of students.
“But we could be Charleston,
so we have something to be
thankful for.”

Power crews from as far
away as Ohio worked to re-
store electricity to the townand
campus.

Although building damage
at the college was not exten-
sive, roofs were unmercifully
battered. Watts dorm had the
most serious damage--a por-
tion of its roof was blown off.
Knox, Akers and Irwin dorms
also suffered some roof dam-
age. Although a tree fell on
Rusk eating house, no exten-
sive damage occurred. The
roof of Johnston gym suffered
water leakage.

At the home of President
John Kuykendall, a large oak
tree was felled, taking roof
shingles with it and damaging

the porch roof and chimney.

The college was saved from
losing on-campus phone serv-
ice since all telephone lines are
underground. “We were lucky
in that respect,” said Meetze.

Meetze compared the cur-
rent recovery period to the one
following the Chambers fire of
1921. “We're lucky,” he stated,
noting that more damage did
not occur to buildings. “It
would be difficult to replace
historical buildings.”

The townalso tooka beati ng,
and according to town clerk
Bill Brannon, the dollar value
of damages has not yet been
determined.

During the time that electric-
ity was suspended, extra po-
licemen were on hand at night
to guard streets against van-
dals. First Step Sports, of Main
Street, suffered a broken win-
dow, the only reported case of

and structures resulting from Hurricane
Hugo's heavy winds last weekend, there
was a small, yet potent, spark of hope. Ina
fascinating display of communion, several
hundred members of the college commu-
nity collaborated with the grounds crew to
begin the laborious cleanup process.

President John Kuykendall, whose own
house wasa victim of falling trees, described
the volunteer effort as “the epitome of the
Davidson spirit.” Kuykendall noted that he
was inspired by the effort, saying “it made
me want to join in.”

Students, teachers, administrators and
staff assisted with the campus’s restoration
as best they could. Some raked leaves and
gathered branches. Others attempted to
dislodge hanging limbs. One administrator,
exhibiting lumberjack. boots, goggles and
protectiveclothing, broughthis chainsaw to
cut fallen branches.

Several student Commons workers
brought refreshments to the volunteers.

The grounds crew was delighted with the
help they received from the college commu-
nity.

Allen Sherrill, a Davidson
groundskeeper, was busy this weekend
chainsawing tree limbs. “It was great,” he
said, in reference to the help. “They gota lot
done on Friday.and Saturday.” He empha-
sized the students’ genuine concern for the
campus saying, “They take pridein the way
the school looks.”

J. Hernandez-Chiroldes, professor of
Spanish, was recording the destruction with
his camera. “I really felt touched by the
students’ gesture,” he said. “That's the
Davidson traditiongpeople working for
other people.”

Senior Robert Lovas, a volunteer, also
Stated that “it was great” and “everyonedid
a great job.” However, Lovas expressed his
dissatisfaction with the number of volun-

, teers, stating that he felt more students
should have helped in the cleanup effort.
