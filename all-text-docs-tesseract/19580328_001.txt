Faculty at Work

By EODIE ARMFIELD
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Faculty committees investigating fraternities, drink-
ing, and student conduct in both chapel and Vespers are
all hard at work and some may be ready with prelimi-

nary reports by next Tuesday’s faculty meeting, Acting
President C. J. Pietenpol announced this week.

At a press interview with re- ;
porters and members of the|Committee headed up by Dr.

CHAPEL CONDUCT?

Q. What has been done or is
being done about chapel con-
duct and programs?

A. A committee to investigate
chapel programs, as well as
chapel conduct, has been ap-
pointed. As to whether or not
this committee will be prepared
to report to the faculty on Wed-
nesday is uncertain. It is prob-
ably not too reasonable to ex;
_ pect a report since they began

their work not long ago.

Davidsonian Feature Editor
The average Davidson student knows but one-half
of the identifications and questions listed in the poll

above.

This week a supervised
“World we live in” question-
aire was administered to 230
members of the student body.
(Broken down by classes 20%
of this number were freshmen,
32% sophomores, 27% juniors,
and 21% seniors)—The average
score was 52%, the low was
18% and there was but one
verified 100% score.

Frank Wetzel, Ricky Nelson,
Rev. James Cole (of KKK fame)
and Joseph McCarthy were
known by over 90% of those
interviewed, while less than
35° could name the U. S. At-
torney General.

The President of Mexico was

identified by only 6 men, and!
less than 20% could name the
U. S. See. of Labor; 16% the
Premier of France; 15% the
Sec. of the Treasury; and 12%
the Prime Minister of Canada.

Not half (48%) could name
the Prime Minister of England
(Churchhill and Chamberlain
placed second).

Only 8% recognized Arthur
H. Dean as having anything to
do with international confer-
ences (“head of U. S. Communist
party’’).

Slightly over 80% could place

Gilbert was instructed to poll

period by one day.

Sailstad Assures Stable
Financial Situation Here

By DON STOWELL
Davidsonian Steff Reporter
“The financial situation of the college-is very good,”
assured Mr. R-J. Sailstad, Assistant to the President in

College Development, in an

When asked if the absence
of a President has hurt the col-
lege financially, Mr. Sailstad re-
plied, “I don’t think the college
has lost any money and every:
thing has proceeded on sched-
ule.”

He emphasized the fact that
the Ten-Year Plan, adopted dur-
ing Dr. Cunningham's admini-
stration, is an important factor
in the college's “steady program
of growth.” and that this
growth “has come about be-
cause it is planned and will
continue because it is planned
and not based on chance.”

He believes that because the
Plan is based on “educational
objectives, not just needs,” it
is effective.

FLEXIBLE BLUEPRINT

The Plan is defined as “a
flexible blueprint for future ac-
tion that does not emphasize
one phase of education above
another.”

This can “be seen by the fact
that the new science laboratory
building. restoration or replace-
ment of Shearer Hall as the

Building, physical education,
and endorsement of arts and
lectures series are listed among
other things on the Plan.

Colonel Walter E. Sewell will

and steel.” Less than half is'
designed for plant and equip-
ment.

The total for the Plan is a}
“substantial calculated amount
based on one thousand stu-
dents. “You might be interested |
to know along this line,” Sail-
stad added, “that an anony-|
mous donor will soon make one!
item on the list a reality—a!
permanent developmental read-
ing laboratory.

“It will be equipped not only’
for the slow reader but for the'
student who wants to increase!
his reading capacity and com-
prehension.” |

GOOD MANAGEMENT

Mr. Sailstad mentioned some
of the factors involved in run-
ning a college from the busi-
ness standpoint. First, he
praised Mr. Martin and his staff
for carrying on “extremely
good business management.”

He then proudly noted the
“Living Endowment,” money
given by alumni, friends, pa-;
rents, and corporations, such as
Esso, DuPont, Sears, and the
Woolworth ‘Company.

Art Exhibit Features
Weodblock Prints

Sixty color woodblock prints
by Utamaro and Hokusai will
be displayed in the foyer of
Chambers from April 17
26. 24 originals and 36 repro-
ductions by these two great
Japanese printmakers comprise
the show.

The works cover tne period day night at 7:30 in the College

of history from about. 1790-1830.

Utamaro’s absorbing theme
was women—professional beau-
ties and the like. Hokusai spe-
cialized in landscapes which
capture the various moods of
nature.

The Japanese color woad-
block print originated in the
18th century as a plebian art
form within the purchasing
ability of the masses.

A separate block of cherry: |

wood was cut for each color.
There was no press. All blocks
were registered and. each color
transferred from block to paper
by rubbing.

Endowment Study
includes Davidson

In a recent survey conducted
by the “U. S. News and World
Report.” Davidson was one of
63 colleges and universities
chosen for a study of how vari-
ous college endowment funds
are being invested.

Indicated in the poll was a
Jarge shift away from fixed-in-
come investments into common
stocks.

However, of the 63 colleges
checked, Davidson had less per-
centage of its endowment in-
vested in common stock than
did any other college except
Grinnell.

According to the article, 55
per cent of the total. or 1.7 bil-
lion dollars. is now invested in
common stock.

Investments in preferred
stocks, real estate, bonds, and
other assets total only 1.3 bil-
lion.
