Barium Christmas Party

One of the finest things inaugeuvateck at
Davidson in the history of the present Stu
dent Body is the now aunual Christmas party
for Barium Springs kids. Last year just be
fore the Christinas holidays about two tian
dred of the orphan youngsters eae dowi to

the campus on busses and were
by the ten fraternities aud the Canipu
in the different fraternity houses

It was an unusual sight to see doe
down on his knees surrounded by a ring of
wide-eyed ten-year olds, telling them Christ
mias stories. The students did a wood job of
entertaining and seemed to vet a big kick
out of the job; but the best Job of entertam
ing was done by the kids. They were net a
bit shy, especially the little girls, aud their
full-of-pepness made the job easy.

We of the Joe College student world tend
to forget that the world outside is peopled
with The Poeketbook

It is good for us to hear the patter of not so
big, but bigger than little feet in our frafer-

reminds us of the true spiritoof Christmas

We have all heard that history has

trieve what has been lost in the
last month in Asia. Have we forgot-
ten the ease-of Czechoslovakia, and

the other nations behind the Iron
Curtain? Have we forgotten the
years that it will take before we
again establish favorable relations
with these nations, if ever? Have
we forgotten that the whole Ber-
lin crisis could have been avoided
had we but the foresight to have
rejected any program for the divi-
sion of Germany, that called for the
complete encirclement of Berlin by
Soviet territory? Admittedly, hind-
sight is much easier than foresight,
but Communist dominations of Chi-

though that future is very near if
we do not avoid it by acting now,
For the bullet in China is aimed at
us.

If we do not stop the Communists
in China, we are in grave danger of
(1) having the whole of Asia fall
into Communists hands, (2) having
the Marshall Blan fail because Euro-
pean countries such as England and
the Netherlands, already hard-hit by
the elimination of trade with coun-
tries behind the Tron Curtain, will
doubtlessly fail to make ends meet
even with American aid if they are
also deprived of their Asian trade,
and (3) an industrialist China, po-
tentially one of the greatest powers
the world has ever known under
Communist control would be a ser-
ious threat to American security in
time of war.

A program of immediate aid, su-
pervised by American military and
financial advisors in order to elimi-
nate Chinese graft and corruption
in the use of this. aid, is the only
possible solution for the Chinese
problem, Our objective will not be
mere aid to friends, It will be to halt
Communism in Asia in order to
save our own — and Chinese necks.

Whose bullet? No one’s but our
own. May history not judge us as a
nation of firemen who sat around
debating while the hotise burned

“Students may not date in park-

worrying Florida State students. Ac-
cording to an editorial in the Fla-
beau, students will be allowed a few
minutes grace when they bring their
dates home, but it will be a very
short few minutes. i

the Club vehemently assert the stu-

“Twinkletoes” Bob Cox are provid-

should start something like this at
Davidson, what with so many legs

To close up this column here is
a poem by Alice Hamilton of the
Lenoir-Rhymean.

She promised to befaithful

She promised to be true,

She promised to be steadfast

And always loving too.

Davidson and Barium Springs have been
buddiés for a long time.‘In fact they are
blood ‘cousins, both having been born and
reared in the Presbyterian Church. Through
more years than most of us can remember
they have worked together and supported
one another. Barium kids learn to to-

a football—almost as soon as they learn to
twalk. As a matter of course, Barium boys,

only outside, but get into the classrooms and
Chambers auditorium where they display an
inconceivable dirtiness and give bad odor.
