Russian bluegrass plays the grunge

~ By Tom Mew
The Russian bluegrass band
Kukuruza will perform in the

Chambers Multipurpose Room to-

day.

The band, whose name means
“Corn” in Russian, has performed
extensively in Eastern Europe, in-
cluding headlining festivals in
Bulgaria, Poland, and Czechoslo-
vakia. In addition, the band has
also performed with American mu-
sicians Roy Clark and the Nitty
Gritty Dirt Band. °

Kukuruza had its start in the
mid-seventies, when the members

_of the group, who were students in
“Moscow began to play more tradi-
tional British and American mu-
sic. As aresult of the film Deliver-
ance (which was shown in Russia
in the early 1980s), the members

became interested in bluegrass.
After teaching themselves blue-
grass style from listening to
records, the members took the
name Kukunuza and began to play
professionally.

In addition to original music,
the band also plays a variety of
cover tunes, including American
country and bluegrass songs. Al-
though heavily influenced by
American bluegrass, Kukuruza
also incorporates many of its re-
gional influences. Forexample, the
band utilizes many melodies from
old Slavic folk tunes and does most
of its singing in Russian.

Because of domestic censor-
ship in the former Soviet Union,
the group was originally forced to
sell itself as a novelty act in order
to survive. As a result, they have

recorded one album of children’s
songs. After a brief tour of America
in the spring of 1993, the band did
some recording with Sugar Hill
Records, although no album has
been released states-side.

Kukuruza is composed of six
members. Andrei Shepelev plays
banjo and other stringed instru-
ments and is the group’s chief
songwriter. Georgi Palmov plays
mandolin and harmonica. Because
of his fluency in English he also
acts as emcee.

Other members of the band
include Irina Surina on lead vo-
cals, Sergei Mosolov on fiddle,
Alexi Aboltynsh on bass and
Mikhail Venikov on guitar. Look
for Kukuruza to provide an excel-
lent evening of traditional and not
so traditional bluegrass music.

“Well-I don’t know, but I’ve
been told / If ya keep on dancin’,
you'll never grow old/Socome on
darlin’, put a purty dress on, we’re
gonna go out tonight”—Steve
Miller

“Cowboys don’t cry and he-
roes don’t die / Good always wins
again and again / Love is a sweet
dream that always comes true / If
life were like the movies, I’d never
be blue”—Alan Jackson

“Just gettin’ by on gettin’ by’s
my stock and trade”—Jerry Jeff
Walker

“Walkin’ down a lonely high-
way not feelin’ alone / Thinkin’
back when things went my way
and not the road I’m on/ Well, I’ve
been down a time or two, but it
never lasted long / I can always
make it through on a wing and a
prayer and a song”—Clint Black

Well, I fear I must leave you
now. But I couldn’t let you go for
the summer without a few parting
words from one of my heroes, Hal

Ketchum:

Guess it’s time to say
goodnight

I’ve sung you every song I
know.

- Let me stand and watch you

dream

One more time before I go...

Close your eyes,

You’ ve gotalong day comin’.

Youshould have beensleepin’

A long time ago.

And to all those about to leave
us for good, I bid you happy trails
until we meet again.

in those days at the school’s beginning, my life,

we walked the iron length of tracks under the light
of distant pinwheel stars, the slow evening of a

small carolina town. in groups of two, we listened

to the cicadas drone, the whippoorwills shrill and far

away, we climbed and you unlatched the tiny window

at the top of the caboose. The museum stayed quiet
behind us as we settled our bones on the atlantic coast line,
the ghost conductor chaperoning from his corner,

his waxy lips and faded overalls frozen and grinning.

No one bothered us there, in musty, gasoline-drenched
darkness. Or knew where we were, or that these images were
never recorded, between us alone, our last uncomplicated
happiness. I thought about ten years from now

painful reunions, and coming back to find you married
to everything I never was. your eyes blue and distant
as cornflowers, once fierce and vulnerable

you, the salesman of cool laughter

walking by in a second tossed behind.
