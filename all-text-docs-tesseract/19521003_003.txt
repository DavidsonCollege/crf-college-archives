the brightest the home crowd had enjoyed so far this season.
and the Cats themselves were undoubtedly happiest of all. For
just a little while it really appeared that Davidson had a chance
to whip a team favored over them by two or three touchdowns.

There are many players and fans who will tell you that
Davidson would have whipped the Generals had it not been
for that freak play. ‘That, however, remains a moot question.
And it isn't the most important one.

It was abvious to even the most partisan Wildcat fans last
week that W&L was a more powerful team than theirs. That
could be seen when Lindsay, Barcelona, Broyles, ct al, continual-
ly ripped through the Cat line for substantial gains. It was also
obvious (though a painful admission) that the Generals played
the game more skillfully and had more drive than the Cats.

These. however. are not the most important facts
about the game last Saturday. The salient facts were that
Neil Graham, Ben Craig, and Roger Wright were piling
up more and more plays at the line of scrimmage; that
Jack Ruth's ball handling gets smoother every week; that
Roy White was running like he hasn't in a long time: that
Bob Renn continued to shine, especially on defense: that
Jim Thacker shook loose for some beautiful gains; that
end play was vastly improved; that Leroy Fargason did a
very good job at fullback; and that as a group, the whole
Dauidson team did a bangup job.

It undoubtedly appears more than slightly contradictory
to say that on the one hand W&L played the better game. on
the other that the Cats did o.k. too. However, when you con-
sider certain facts, the two statements don’t seem at all incom-
patible.

The main thing that made Washington and Lee better
is practically as old as time itself: it was money. It is no secret
in any quarters that the Generals are a $50,000 ball team, if they
don’t represent an even greater investment. The Wildcats rep-
resent 3 $23,000 investment. And in football, as in business,
the larger investment is generally going to yield a biggec dividend.

This fact is no revelation to members of the David-
son football team. They know probably better than any-
body else that they have been outmanned in almost every
game since they can remember. It's the students and fans
who should realize what the Cats are up against.

All this, however, should not be any sanction for David-
son's dropping a game. Many a military battle has been won
Ey a commander and troops who realize that they are-at a dis-
advantage; that’s only facing the facts. The real test is whether
they can take that fact in hand, and work it to their own ad-
vantage by making their own breaks and capitalizing on them
and by playing it cool when the chips are down and fighting and
scrapping every inch of the way.

Davidson has the commander; he has in the past
proved himself capable of taking hold of a situation in
which his team was theoretically inferior and winning out.
If he can convince his men that they can and will, whip
some of the big boys, things won't go on like they have.

Maybe the Cats won't win. Maybe they'll lose every
game from now on out. That's the way the professional odds-
makers will probably figure things. But the oddsmakers don’t
often figure in such things. as spirit and hustle and will to win
against teams with potsful of money and talent. And that’s
where the Cats have been strongest so far.

Anyway, it's up to the boys. They saw how the stands
went wild when they were ahead last week. They know they've
got support. All we can do now is to watch and see what comes
to pass.

Cats Get Breather, Will|fag Football Set

Play State Next Week

A last-minute change of plans moved the date of the David-
son-N. C. State game up to next Saturday. October 11. State
will play Georgia tomorrow at Athens.

At a meeting after chapel this morning the team and Coach

Bill Dole agrecd to the shuffle in
dates. The change came because
the University of North Carolina
was forced to cancel their scheduled
contest with Georgia tomorrow
when a member of the Tar Heel
team was stricken with polio.

Since the Cats had an open
date on October 11, the post-
ponement of the State game
will not alter their schedule
otherwise.

The Cats have heen working
hard this weck on defenses to stop
the plunging attack .of big, 200-
pound Alex Webster, and devising
at the same time an attack of their
own that will garner enough touch-
downs to bring the first win to
Wildcat Hollow.

However, for the second
straight weelr, they have caught
a team on the rebound from a
humiliating defeat. Washington
and Lee had just recovered
from a swamping by the Blue
Devils and now the Wolfpack
has to be handled on the back-
lash of a 39-0 loss to George -
Washington.

Nobody Sad

Although losing to the Generals
last week, neither the team nor the
coaches and students seemed to be
wearing the. mourner’s veil. The
team played well against a better-
manned and bigger team, and
plenty of fight and spirit. was eyi-
dent everywhere on the field. It is
this “new spirit.’ new team, and
new coach that will take. the David-
son-State feud to Raleigh next
week,

Meanwhile, behind. the Coliseum

Coach Horace Hendrickson is push- |

ing his boys to the limit and is hop-
ping mad over last week's showing
by his team. He'll be depending on
big Ray Parkouskie, the blocking-
back converted to tackle, to stop
the plunging of Leroy Fargason
and the slants of Jimmie Thacker
and Bobby Renn, and on Steve
Kosilla to snatch the passes and
stop the end runs of the Cats.

State Harriers
Rated Favorites

Over Wildcats

By BILL SLEDGE

The Wildcat Harriers, eight
strong, left at noon today for Ral-
eigh where they will meet the
highly-rated N. C. State Wolfpack.

Coach Pete Whittle said that the
Wildcats will be decided underdogs.
North Carolina State is the defend-
ing Southern Conference champion
and has most of last year’s squad
back, plus many promising fresh-
men.

“No one in the conference
will be able to give State any
competition,” said Whittle.
“They have an awfully good
chance of making a good show-
ing in the National Intercol-
legiate meet later in the fall.”
Time trials were held Wednes-

day over the rugged three-mile
course. Bob Henry, Floyd Feency,
and Steve Gooding tied for first,
with a time of 15:06. The others

in order were: Bill Shipley, Bill

Russell, J. V. Howell, J. A. Turner,
and Joe Carpenter.

The Harriers will be running
against one of the best cross coun-
try teams in the South and a good
showing will be a credit to them.

One setback to the chances of
Davidson beating the Wolfpack
harriers came when Bill Shipley re-
cently developed knee trouble. Last
year, he was a stalwart on the
cross-country and track teams. He
did make a good showing in time
trials, but was slowed down to some
extent by the bad knee.

Cats’ New Spirit & Hustle
Due To Dole’s Guidance

In their first two starts in the 1952 season, Davidson's
gtidders have come out on the short end of the score.

nobody seems terribly unhappy about it. Why?

In losing the Wildcats have
showed more fight and spirit than
they have in many a game. They
play the game to win, and they
don’t give up when they're behind.
And what's behind this new spirit,
this new will to win?

The answer to that one is
easy. It is a smiling. person-
able Davidson coach named
Bill Dole who has injected a
large dose of new life and
morale into a football team
which has been faltering for a
long time. It.is this same man
who has made football less of
an ordeal and more of a chal-
lenge for the boys who wear
the Red and Black.

Met D. C. Challenge

When Dole took the Davidson
job, he looked at it as a challenge.
He knew that there was a defeatist
attitude on the Cat campus which
had. become widely prevalent he-
cause, simply enongh, Davidson
hasn't had a winning team since
1947. He knew that the Cats were
going onto the field in game after
game, knowing that the odds were

Loverwhelming -for their defeat, and

playing mostly to get the game
over,

Dole wasn't having any of that.
On his first visit to the Davidson
campus last spring, the former
Eastern Carolina mentor called a
meeting of the football team. “There
isn’t poing to be any of this busi-
ness of going out on a football
field for two hours just to get the
game. over,” he told them. “Any-
body on. my team who feels that
way isn't going to play. | believe
Davidson can win football games
and T want to make you think so
too.”

From some men that might have
sounded like an uftimatum, but

from Dole it was simply an an-
nouncement of his aims and a tacit
admission that his work had been
cut out for him.

GOT A NEW HALFBACK
THAT'S SURE-FIRE

To Begin

Monday

By FLOYD FEENEY
Tag football begins Monday to open this year’s race for the

Interfraternity Sports Trophy.

This game was inaugurated last year at Davidson, re-

piacing touch football.

Tag football is played by seyen-
man teams. The field is marked off
into five equal parts between the
zoals; a team failing to advance
the ball the length of one of
these divisions surrenders the ball
to their opponents at the nearest
division,

Passing Stressed

Passing is stressed in this
game. Both forward and lateral
passing from any part of the
field is legal any number of
times. A player carrying the
ball must halt when touched
between the waist and the neck.

The wrestling tournament will
follow football sometime early in
November, .

Managers already chosen for the
coming season are: T. W. Aldred,
KA; John Nesbit, ATO; George
Lippard, Kappa Sig; Paut Eastman,
Sigma Chi; Rill Stedge, Pika;
George Thomas, Reta; Bill Nelson.
Phi Delt: Don Menzies, Pi Kapp;
Charlie Hall, Phi Gam.

The sports trophy is given

each year to the fraternity
which acquires the most points
throughout the year in inter-
fraternity compctition.

Ten Sports Played

Points are given in cach of. ten
sports and for. varsity participation.
Last years’ program included these
sports: football, basketball, softball,
volleyball, wrestling, table tennis,
track, horseshoes, handball, tennis,
and swinining.

Last year in a very close
tace the Kappa Sigs edged the
Phi Gams by a score of 1278
to 1257, Close behind these two
were the Phi Delts with a total
of 1225 and the KA’s with 1159
points.

These. four fraternities along
with the Siema Chi’. appear to be
the. strongest contenders for tlic

cup at this point All fraternities

seem to. he stronger than last, year ~

and ihe race. will probably not be
decided watil late next spring.

Cagers Already

Begin

According to Southern Confer-
ence regulations, basketball practice
cannot .offically begin until No-
vember Ist. but many varsity hope-
fuls have already begun individual
workouts and practice. Coach Dan-
ny Miller, beginning his first year
here, feels that lie has a lot of
good material to work with, but
says there's plenty of work aliead
in shaping up the 52-53 Wildcat
baskethallers before the season
opens with N.C, State, December 6.

will probably be the nucleus from
which Coach Miller will build his
