Union Board breathes life into -
Thursdays at the 900 Room

By MIKE WELLMAN
Staff Writer

Doing homework will no longer be the
only viable choice for the Davidson student
on Thursday nights this year.

Scrapping the previous trivia games that
were held in the 900 Room in past years, the
Union Board has decided instead to use the
10 p.m. slot there as a forum for student per-
formers.

Billed as Live Thursdays, the program
hopes to bring back a fun atmosphere where
students can hang out after studies, or even
as a break between.

The program kicked off two weeks ago
with a performance by the cast of the Oops!
Improv Troupe, and this past week was
graced by the man in charge of Live
Thursdays, Russell Howard ’06.

Howard hopes the program will allow for
more exposure of student artists who had
previously been without a forum for their
work, while at the same time providing a fun
and entertaining way for students to spend
their Thursday nights.

Future acts to grace the 900 Room for
Live Thursdays include the jazz quintet Off
Main this coming Thursday as well as The
Delilahs.

To the question of whether the atmosphere
would be similar to that of a coffee house,
Howard said he expected each different per-
formance to shape the atmosphere of the 900
Room.

When asked about what kind of acts he
expected to see in the future, Howard said he
hoped anyone with a wish to be heard would

Sailing? Always popular, but subject to
finicky wind conditions and the availability
of dock shoes at your local sporting goods
store.

Why not venture into the hidden underbel-
ly of the Union and sign up for the Davidson
Outdoors whitewater kayaking trip, sched-
uled for this coming weekend, September
23-25?

By its very nature, kayaking is an enlight-
ened sport.

Think about
it: if you are
boating in a
canoe and you
suddenly find
yourself drink-
ing water rather
than breathing &
air, you bail ©
immediately.

Your boat
starts to float
downstream,
your gear sails
off in 15 differ-
ent directions,
and you begin
the laborious
process of set-
ting everything
aright.

In a similar situation in a kayak, you take
a moment to marvel at this lovely aquatic
environment from your inverted position,
bend your body into the shape of a “C” and
snap yourself back upright. Crisis averted,
continue merrily downstream.

True, there is a certain level of practice
required to learn the art of the kayak “roll,”
but, once mastered, a whole new world of

take advantage of the new program.

Davidson alumni like Kate Minogue ’05
as well as performers of slam poetry may
even find their way into the Live Thursdays
schedule in the future.

Those interested in performing should
speak to Howard to be approved for an open
date.

For listeners, stop by the 900 Room every
Thursday at 10 p.m. if you feel like your
biology textbook isn’t registering enough of
a pulse.

bumper stickers will become _ yours:
“Kayakers roll over and do it again,” “Surf
New Hampshire,” “Paddle solo, sleep tan-
dem” etc.

Not only will your car look way cooler
than the guy who plasters his with four years
of parking stickers, but you will have fallen
in love with an amazing new sport.

But suppose that next weekend is already
booked. Will you have to wait a whole year
before such a priceless opportunity will
again come your way?

We at DO, anticipating your anxiety and
pain, are
already a step
ahead.

Every
Thursday
night
Davidson
Outdoors
offers kayak
rolling — les-
sons in the
Baker pool
from 7:30-9
p.m.

For no
extra charge,
the campus
paddling con-
tingent will
show you the
basics, assist you in your own fledgling
attempts, and more often than not offer
amusement in the form of “stupid boater
tricks:” flips, races, and headstands.

So take a break from your studies, for a
weekend or just an evening, and add a super-
fluous skill to your resume.

Because you never know when you will
find yourself upside down in a kayak moving
swiftly toward class V whitewater.
