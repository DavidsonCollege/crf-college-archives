What kind of protection do

Davidson students have against
radioactive fallout from a nu-
clear explosion? At present,
none, but plans are being made
to construct fallout shelters on
the college campus. Progress so
far has been slow; however, the
town of Davidson has already
taken concrete steps in prepara-
tion for family survival.

The family fallout shelter has
been selected by civil defense
authorities as the first line of
defense against radiation. “A
fallout shelter is good insurance,
just like automobile insurance,”
explains Dr. John I. Hopkins,
Radiation Study Committee
chairman and physics profes-
sor. “You never expect to have
an accident in your car, and in
the the same way we hope the
need for a shelter never pre-
sents itself, but it is good in-
surance in case it is ever need-
ed.” :

Family shelters are usually
massive structures in a base-
ment or a back-yard. Various
types are being built in David-
son. Dr. Sam Maloney has con-
structed one in his basement of
eight inch concrete blocks, sand
bags, and a two-foot thick con-
crete ceiling. A more elaborate
one is being built by his neigh-

Concern?

bor, Dr. Joseph Drake, profes-
sor of sociology. It is also a
concrete structure but is being
set up behind his house and
when completed will contain an
air filtration system.

Nine shelters are presently
ready for use in Cornelius and
about eight in Davidson. Others
are under construction in both
towns.

Such radiation shields are de-
signed to stop the lethal doses
of X-rays which would be
emitted by falling particles. This
can be uccomplished by a wall
of concrete two feet thick or
other shielding material of
equal density.

Various efforts are being
made by the town to develop a
controlling civil defense  or-
ganization which would make
this area self-sufficient. “Com-
munity organization is necessary
because conditions in Charlotte
may not be the same as here,”
states Hopkins.

Mr. R. W. Adams has been ap-
pointed civil defense director
for. the northern area of North
Mecklenburg County by David-
son’s Mayor Jackson. “In David-
son there are 13 key people who
control the various phases of
civil defense administration,”
says Jackson.

The next debating event plan-

Tentatively, Davidson will be

represented by Pat Freeny and
Ed Barfield, affirmative; Skip
Jones and Doug Wilkerson, ne-
gative. Greg Govan and Tom
Poston will participate in the
forensic events.

Appalachian State Teachers’
College at Boone will be the
scene of another contest for
the Davidson squads. Present
plans indicate that two teams
and perhaps one or more stud-
ents will be entered in the
forensic events at the Annual
Tournament there on Dec. 1-2.

The varsity and the novices,
coached by Mrs. H. T. Lilly and
Dr. J. T. Drake, have a combin-
ed seasonal record of 17 wins

Princeton’s Turkevich
Gives Phi Bete Lectures

Dr. John Turkevich, professor of chemistry at Princeton, will lecture on Nov. 26
and 27 as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar Program.

The program is sponsored by
The United Chapters of Phi
Beta Kappa to enable more
schools to have leading scholars
visit their campuses. It was be-
gun in 1956, and this year fea-
tures seven scholars who will
make more than 70 visits to
various institutions throughout
the country.

Turkevich will. be in Hodson
Hall of the Fine Arts Center
from 4-5 p.m. on Mon., Nov. 27,
to play a recording he made of
the choirs at the Great Cathed-
ral in Moscow. All students are
invited. t

At 8 that night he will address
chemistry majors in the Martin
Science Building. His topic will
be “The World of Fine Parti-
cles.”

On Tues., Nov. 28, from 45
p.m. Turkevich will show slides
of his visit to Russia last sum-
mer in the Morrison

FE

“Science and Education in the
Soviet Union” in Hodson Hall.
The lecture will be open to the
entire student body.

Turkevich has had a varied
and interesting career in the

science at the U. S. Exposition
in Moscow. He was also acting
scientific attache at the U. S.
Embassy in Moscow in the sum-
mer of 1960.

Turkevich was a member of
the U. S. delegation to the
United Nations Conference on
the Peaceful Uses of Atomic
Energy in Geneva in both 1955
and 1958. He has also served as
a consultant with the Atomic
Energy Commission; and during

Although the calendar was
drawn up before the Academic-
Scheduling. Poll was taken by
the Student Council and THE

many of the changes agree with
the student opinion revealed by
this poll. Students also indi-

of the eight day exam period

religion and culture, where he
has done the main portion of
his work.

Tillich has also studied the
relationship of religion to depth
psychology, and the relation of
religion to the philosophical
movement of existentialism and
the visual arts.

As Tillich explains it, he
builds his theology “on the
method of correlation between

predicament and the answers
given in the classical symbols of
religion.”

During his lifetime Tillich has

Culture. He is currently working
on his twenty-second book, the

Remodeling, Expansion Planned

Renovation of Chambers audi-
torium, enlargement of the lan-
guage laboratory, and provision
of facilities for the new humani-
ties course are among the pro-
jects being considered for fu-
ture college building goals.

DOME ROOM UTILIZED

However, none of these items
has been assigned priority as of
yet. Robert A. Currie, business
-manager, noted, “As all of these
are long-range needs, we will
decide later which will get
priority when we see which
need is most pressing and how
much money we have.”

Although no specific plans

have been drawn up, the Busi-
ness Office has been able to ar-
rive at an estimated budget.
Actual plans will not be drawn
until a particular project gains
priority.

The new humanities course,
which will be inaugurated next
year, will require a lecture room
for 100 students and smaller
rooms for group discussions.
Currie expressed the possibility
that the dome room in Cham-
bers could be improved for use
in this course.

Due to its success, the lan-
guage lab will have to be ex-

student's personality, emotional
stability, language qualifica-
tion, and development of leader-
ship potential.

The student is also graded on
a statement he makes explaining
his “project,” or why he wants
to go abroad to study, what he
would like to accomplish while
he is abroad, and how he plans
to go about fulfilling his aims.

Besides the application blanks
themselves, an applicant must
submit a physical recommenda.
tion from a doctor, must be
fluent in the language of the
country he has applied for, and
must include his college tran-
script.

The formal interviews, held
last Friday by Professors Aber-
nethy, Cumming, and Thomp-

panded within the next five
years. Addition of another row
of booths in the present lab
may be expected in the near fu-
ture. Further expansion will be
delayed, however, as it will be
very expensive.

AIR-CONDITIONING

Chambers auditorium is also
in need of renovation. At pres-
ent, plans call for air-condition-
ing the auditorium, providing
dressing rooms, and improving
the lighting, especially on the
stage. Changes are also envision-
ed which would improve the
acoustics.

son, are the first in a series of
screening processes the appli-
cations of the three students
will undergo.

From here the applications
are sent to one of several na-
tional committees composed of
five professors each which are
set up by the Institute of Inter-
national Education, which di-
rectly or indirectly handles most
exchange programs in the coun-
try.

A separate national commit-
tee is appointed by the Institute
to handle applications for study
grants to each of the many for-
eign countries which participate
in the exchange program.

Professor Embry, who served
for two years on the national
committee for France, noted
that experienced men from dif-
ferent fields such as science,
philosophy, and languages are
asked to serve on the commit-
tees, and that the screening
processes are most thorough.

Each national committee will
select from hundreds of appli-
cations a “panel” or list of
students in order of their rating
by the committee.

This panel is submitted to the
State Department, which or-
dinarily sends it intact to the
Fulbright Committee in the dif-
ferent participating countries,
and these committees, which
have the power to refuse any of
the applications, particularly
any student with an unfeasible
project, are responsible for as-
signing the Fulbright Scholars
to different universities in the
country.
