‘No Direction Home’ explores legendary icon

By WILSON MCBEE
Staff Writer

Martin Scorsese’s documentary “No
Direction Home,” which premiered last
week on PBS and is avail-
able now on DVD, is the
latest display in a national
exhibition of Bob Dylan-
worship which has been
raging since about 1997,
when Dylan, just over a
brush with a nearly-fatal
heart disease, released the |
critically lauded come-
back album “Time of
Mind”.

Since then it’s been all -

zine cover-posing, mem-
oit-publishing, Victoria’s

the serpentine croaker. He
continues to tour relent-
lessly, performing at state
fairs, minor league baseball fields, and Wal-
Mart parking lots — anywhere, it seems,
bizarre enough to please his pallet. Last year,

‘Changing Minds’ tack-
les mental health issues

By GEORGIE AHRENDT
Health Advisor

It’s not too often that we find room in our
weekly planners to pencil in a little time for
ourselves.

In between classes, meetings, homework
and socializing, our mental health just does-
n’t make the cut. Sometimes even basic
hygiene gets pushed back to squeeze in more
time for studying. (Or maybe that’s just me.)

Starting this year, a group of students are
standing up for
mental health at
Davidson and mak-
ing a bold state-

ment: “It’s ok to
feel depressed,
angry, stressed,
pressured, con-
fused, frustrated

and insecure. And
you are not alone!”

The group
Changing Minds is
brand new but the
issues it addresses
are not.

“Mental health
disorders and problems run rampant on this
campus, and the seriousness of these issues
demands an active dialogue,” said Megan
Sparks ’06, founder and president of
Changing Minds.

The Changing Minds mieinhers intend to
actively open up dialogue and increase

insecure. And you are not
alone!

awareness about a wide variety of issues
related to mental health: depression, eating
disorders, “anxiety, addiction, and stress,
among other things.

Several events are currently in the works.
Among them is a week in November dedi-
cated to mental and bodily health. The week
includes a night called Exgedom. for the

Faces,” which will allow students to infor-
mally speak out about their own personal
experiences with eating disorders and other
related issues.

While diagnosable disorders like anorexia,
bulimia and depression are a worrisome real-
ity here on campus, non-clinical problems
are also ever-present and in no less need of
attention.

We all at some point or another suffer from
stress. Some of us take it out on our pen
caps; others target their friends. Some eat
away unease; oth-
ers drink away dis-
tress. No matter
what, we could all
use a little help
now and then—
that is, if you’re not
too proud to admit
that maybe a little
assistance, support
and comfort would
be welcome.

All too often the
symptoms of men-
tal distress go
unnoticed. It’s not
until you’ve hit rock bottom that you realize
there is a problem.

Changing Minds recognizes the impor-
tance of awareness.

The group hopes that students can learn
the symptoms of mental health disorde;s
before they spiral out of control. Taking the
time to breathe and to look inward doesn’t
always come naturally but sometimes has to
be learned and practiced.

There is a group mentality that we all live
in a “Pleasantville.” There are certainly some
elements of truth to this statement, but there
are also quite a few unpleasant things that
happen here at Davidson. The more we feed
into and confirm the idea that we live in a
the more it masks reality
and normalizes an unattainable ideal, mak-
ing change impossible.

We need to break through the group con-
struct of what Davidson is and what it means
to be a Davidson student.

We need to stop and take a look at our-
selves (not just at the group) and embrace
ourselves as individuals, even if that means
embracing the bad along with the good.

We need to start cheniging. tas:

“No _ Direction

earliest years of
Dylan’s career:

from the boyhood in
Minnesota and _ his
turn as a Greenwich
Village folk hero,
through the career-

erupting descent

into electric rock ~
and roll, to the mysterious motorcycle acci-
dent of July 1966 which sent him into hiding
for fifteen months. New interviews with
Dylan accompany commentary from Joan
Baez, Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul, and
Mary), and, most interestingly, Liam Clancy
(a red-faced Irish expatriate and member of
folk group The Clancy Brothers), among
others, and footage from D. A. Pennebaker’s
unfinished concert documentary “Eat the
Document”, filmed during the 1966 boo-
laden tour of England.

In today’s era of the couch-jumping,
Kabbala-preaching, political sloganizing
celebrity, it’s inspiring to see someone so
unconcerned with image, or, better put, so
willing to sacrifice his image to an artistic
vision. Scorsese’s interviews with Dylan,
like the memoir “Chronicles”, should be
viewed as nothing more than escapes from
definition or clarification. Who really
believes that the teenaged Robert
Zimmerman wanted to go West Point but
turned to music because he “probably could-
n’t get in”? Every statement Dylan makes in

the film should be taken as seriously as this
answer to.a journalist’s query, circa 1964: “I
consider myself mostly a song and dance
man.” Dylan is so purposefully evasive and
cryptic that one wonders if he is even aware
of the last thing he has said while saying the

next. During the first thirty minutes of
Scorsese’s film he pronounces “ideology”
two different ways as if to stress the word’s
insignificance.

It was the belief that Dylan was more than
just a strolling troubadour and was instead a
“protest singer” with ironclad convictions
that caused fans across America and Europe
to boo their hero so mercilessly in 1966.
They thought they knew Bob Dylan, a posi-
tion we know now to be pitifully naive.
Scorsese chooses to end “No Direction
Home” with a moment that illustrates

Dylan’s manic allegiance to his art over
everything and everyone else. On stage with
