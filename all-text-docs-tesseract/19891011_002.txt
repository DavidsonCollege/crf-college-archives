Patterson Court expected to andergo
changes after self-selection

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

The freshman class, perhaps more so
than in past years, will determine the
face of Patterson Court from this point
on. Several houses face shortages of
members while both Phi Gamma Delta
(FIJI) and Greenhouse are attempting
to find places on the Court.

Spencer, Rusk, Warner Hall and Pax
are following a policy which differs
from that of the past few years. More
joint events are being planned to pres-
ent a united front.

“We want the freshmen to eat where
they are most comfortable and lessen
the stress of choosing an eating house,”
said Spencer President M.K. Myatt.
“The houses are trying to show thatit’s
not a number game.”

In conjunction with
these changes, the
houses are trying to
pass a new Dill
through the Patterson
Court Council (PCC).
This bill attempts to
discourage the prac-
tice of “shotgunning”
an cating house by
climinating wait lists.
Before self-selection,
the president of each
house announces the
number of available
spots. The computer
then randomly as-
signs those places.
When a house is full,
the computer will
move to a person's
second choice. If there
is no second choice, the person will not
gct into an eating house.

PCC President.Ben Cardwell said,
“We want to show the similarities of
houses and the fact that a person can be
happy at a inouse he or she hadn’t even
considered. It’s so 1,000 people don’t
shotgun Rusk just because that’s where
a lot of people are going.”

The bill has been approved by all
houses except one.

Cardwell also said that membership
differs widely among houses. Rusk has
165 members. Rusk President Lisa

Howesaid thatall were eating members
since Rusk was able to hire a third cook
in September. Katherine Griffith,
Warner Hall president, said that the
house’s size of 87 members was perfect.

Concerning Spencer's size of 50
members, Myatt said, “We're the small-

est of the three. But Spencer has a di- ,

verse group of girls who are more
comfortable in smaller groups.”

With 34 members, PAX is the small-
est eating house on the court. Ques-
tions have been raised regarding the
future of co-ed eating. A quota on
members necessary for a group to stay
on the Court has not been set by the
Patterson Court Council. Currently,
only financial security determines a

house’s place on the court.

“Wewillonly get stronger,” said PAX
president Marion Kaylor. “Every ten or
so years it swings away from co-ed eat-
ing. We're reached the furthest point,
and now we’re coming back. Seventeen
people joined Pax last year, and that’s
better than most houses did.”

Seniors Sharon Lee Schwartz, Paul
Barringer and Judd Nelson are cur-
rently organizing an ecologically ori-
ented house, appropriately dubbed
Greenhouse. Greenhouse will express
its dedication to the environment by

Davidsonian Editor to marry

Miss Jennifer Lynn Hoffman, an Editor of
The Davidsonian, has become engaged to marry.
The bride is the daughter of Alan Hoffman of
Marietta, Ga., and Judith Crellen of Tucker, Ga.
The prospective groom is Mr. —
Thomas H. Moore, a senior at’
Davidson College. The wedding
is planned for June 23, 1990, in
Two Rivers, Wisconsin, to coin-
cide with the 50th wedding
anniversary celebration of Mr.
and Mrs. Hugo Hoffman, the
bride’s paternal grandparents.

providing vegetarian meals and pro-
moting service projects such as recy-
cling.

“What you eat is a political state-
ment,” said Barringer. “It takes more
grain to create beef than it does to actu-
ally feed people. We're going to do the
nuts and berries routine.” Barringer
hopes the house will purchase organi-
cally grown bulk materials such as
grain, cereals, wheat germ and lettuce.

The house will also grow some of its
own herbs. “We want to find a hippie to
cook and garden,” said Nelson. Inaddi-
tion, the organizersare planning a natu-
ral food store run on the Honor System.

Some of the service ideas include
cleaning up highways, planting trees

and donating food
for Crop Lunch. The
house plans to cut
down on paper dis-
posables and mini-
mize disposables ina
compost pile.

One of the
house’s major func-
tions will be to unify
faculty, students and
staff through its
dedication to the en-
vironment. Schwartz
sees the house as tak-
ing an active role in

' important issues.

“We plan tobe
democratic rather
than exclusive,” she

said. .Greenhouse

proposes a creative

solution to an impor-
tant issue. The environment has be-
come a mainstream concern.”

In order to find a place on the court,
the house will have to secure 60 full-
time eating members. According to
Schwartz, the soonest Greenhouse will
appear on the court is next term. The
organizers have already begun a pub-

licity campaign.
FIJI

Another prospective developmenton
the court is FIJI’s recolonization. FIJI
now has six members, four of whom
are seniors. This small number is unac-
ceptable to the national organization.
However, the nationals decided to
support FIJI’s charter and recolonize
the chapter.

“We're really excited about the re-
colonization,” said FIJI president Todd
Strauser.

“Only one or two chapters a year get
recolonized. I think we got picked be-
cause of Davidson’s prestige. It looks
good to have a chapter here.”

An essential aspect of the recoloniza-
tion is that graduate brothers and na-
tionals will organize the rush. During
the week of November 6-11, FIJI broth-
ers from as far as Florida and Wiscon-
sin will converge upon Davidson to
plan FIJI’s promotion strategy and to
help organize the group. Graduates
who live in Charlotte have already met
with the Davidson FIJI members.
‘Davidson brothers will ciniply provide
the legwork.

“We're starting from strateh;” said
Strauser. “They’re pretending we're
not here--the nationals are running
rush.”

FIJI’s goals are to pledge 25 to 30 new
members, and Strauser said this can be
accomplished. “We’re very. ncutral
now and our image is not bad or good.
The freshmen can mold the fraternity
into-what they“d like it to be: /Davidsgn
needs a strong-Greek-system. We plan
to be trendsetters.”

Strauser said that FIJI plans to use the
ATO house for rush, however, both
Dean of Students Will Terry and Resi-
dence Life Director Richard Terry,
denied having given their approval.

“I don’t know,” said Terry. “I'd feel
uncomfortable doing it unless the PCC
approves.”

Crime Report

On September 27, at 9 a.m., Ed-
ward Azzolino found his 1988 Red
mustang vandalized in Copeland
Parking lot.

The subjectknocked outa window
of his vehicle with a rock causing
$200 worth of damage. The subject
stole the cord from his radar detec-
tor. The cord was valued at $75.
Crime Tip

. It's almost impossible to take pre-

cautions against car vandalism other
than buying an alarm system. Al-
though the parking lots are fairly °
well lighted and patrolled by police-
men, vandalism occurs almost every
week. Officer Davis said the best
precautions to take were to hide
valuables out of site. He also said”
much of the damage mightbe caused
by students playing pranks. In that
case, the best way to protect your car
is not to touch somebody else’s.
