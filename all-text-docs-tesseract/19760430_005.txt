SGA Senate forges ahead:
rephrasings and withdrawals

By ED REES
. Staff Writer

In accord with Faculty
action that took place Tuesday
afternoon, the Senate unani-
mously adopted the Statement
of Student Rights and Res-
ponsibilities, under certain
conditions. The conditions sti-
pulated were raised at the
Faculty meeting, and call for a
rephrasing of the document in
order to make the language
“less contentious.”

SGA President Bo Baskin

. commented that ‘‘some Fac-.

ulty members indicated that
they were offended by the tone
of some of the language; the
conditional adoption of the
document by the Senate is
designed to demonstrate to
the Faculty our willingness to
cooperate with them. ‘‘We
have no wish to antagonize
anyone.”’

Baskin went on to say that

this does not mean that the
substance of the document will
be altered, but merely the
wording changed to express
the ideas in a more ‘positive’
manner.

The Senate also unani-
mously approved the Union
By-laws as presented. These
will now go to a referendum for
the entire student body ‘to
accept or reject. There is some

- doubt that the referendum will

take place before the end of the
term.

Steve Barnes piesenied the
Activities Tax Council alloca-
tions to the Senate for appro-
val. Barnes explained that
forty dollars of each stu-
dent’s tuition is paid directly
to the ATC, which then distri-
butes the funds according to
budget requests from. nine
other student organizations.

ATC allocations are subject
to Senate adoption before they
can take effect. Although

Alumnus sees comedy of errors in

Once again the vocal minority of
the Davidson student body has shown
itself, in another sporadic manner of
pseudoradicalism, its concerned em-

college’s personnel manglement’

To the Editor:

I have been following the latest
personnel moves in basketball at D.C.
thanks to good coverage by the
Davidsonian. I decided to write after
reading Mr. Church’s letter to the
Editor in the April 9, 1976, issue
.n which he stated, ‘‘I do not think it
is the basketball coach only of the
athletic department that should have
been fired.”” Mr. Church’s only error
is that he should have carried it one
step beyond the athletic department.

Since 1968 the personnel changes at
D.C. might be considered a comedy of
errors if it weren’t so tragic. Coach
Driesell left after being hounded by
President Spencer who wanted a
first-class basketball program but
didn’t want to pay the price.

Larry Brown spent a few weeks as
head coach, saw the situation for
what it was, and quit. Terry Holland,
who showed what he really could do
this year at Virginia, was begged to
come back. He inherited Bo Brickels
who had been hired as chief assistant
by Brown. Terry’s years were frust-
rating as he fought gamely for more
money for recruiting expenses and for
upgraded facilities representative of a
major basketball program. Finally, he

resigned in disgust from his alma

mater.
Brickels inherited an impossible
job. He couldn’t do what had to be

. done in two years. He obviously was

fired, even though he recruited the
talent neéded this past year, after
pressure was applied by prominent
Charlotte alumni and alumni trustees
who this year had to listen to Chapel
Hill, Duke and N.C. State friends
laud UNC-C. It was too much for
those doctors, bankers, funeral direc-
tors, insurance and real estate men
who represent D.C. in Charlotte.
Then came Gary Walters. He was

bright. He quit after less than a week:

when he realized he wasn’t, going to
get the support he needed from the
top. Now there’s Pritchett with a four
year contract at over $30,000 a year.
Probably he will get a T.V. program
and all the money from the summer
basketball camps, too. I am sure he
will make in total more than twice

Students blast elitism

Te the Editor:

Mr. Bernhardt makes a disgusting
insinuation in contrasting ‘‘the guys
who lean on rakes outside” with the
president and faculty of Davidson

College. Such a remark betrays an ©

elitist attitude and a class conscious-
ness too prevalent at this school.

Staff members and groundskeepers
are among the hardest working and
least appreciated members of the

college community. Among them, we
have made many friends.
Upon later solicitations for ‘us to

fulfill our enduring obligation to

Davidson, it will be with much.
distaste that we support an annual
fund whose direetor degenerates their
contributions.

what Letty, Terry and Bo made—
ever.

I am not going to argue wnether
D.C. should have big time basketball
or not. What I am going to say is that
the ‘‘personnel manglement”’ is pretty
clear.

To the names Driesell, Brown,
Holland, Brickels, Larranaga, Krohn
and Walters let’s add Bevan and
Cornell, two vice-presidents Spencer
once praised as being the best in their
fields in the country; then Winston,
Nordeen, Strong, Arbuckle, most of
the rest of the development depart-
ment; Gaige and Fuller, two of the
best young faculty ever at D.C.;
Sterling, Noland, Barr, Miller who
really made Ed White look good in
admissions (also Sterling did all of C.
Shaw’s work for him when Sterling
was in the Union); and back to
athletics, Fagg and Stevens. The list
is longer, but I have made my point.

Not all of these people left for better
jobs. Most of them were fed up with
an administration which covered for
the ‘‘big three’’ (Spencer, Smith,
White). While Sam and Ed played
tennis, Shaw was on the road with his
magic show. The ethers did the work.

When are the trustees going to
wake up? When are they going to do
something? Are they going‘to wait
until D.C. is in complete educational
and financial bankruptcy?

pathetic (but fun-loving) side.

Demonstrating ‘deep sympathy for
the fallen Davidson National, hand-

fuls upon handfuls of concerned
individuals came to the Belk quad-
rangle in protest of the administra-
tion’s brutal treatment of Davidson’s
gift to the art world (though, of
course, none could forget who really
organized and directed the National
by himself) (could they?) (Nor could it
slip their minds to inquire exactly
how he feels towards the whole-thing
(I mean, it’s all so obvious isn’t it)).

One can only stand in awe and
admiration, knowing he/she is in the
midst of such self-sacrificing, high-
minded patrons of the artistic
endeavor.

Yet, I must admit confusion at this
point. Were all these unselfish, deter-
mined guardians of the printed ex-
pression recent transfers, for surely I
can’t recall their appearance during
the wee hours of the night while
others slumbered. Obviously the fault
that a keg of beer was lacking at that
time had nothing to do with it, nor
would the apparent non-existance of
fun and games enter into the picture
as a source of influence.

I remain mystified. I realize that,
indeed, many hours of repackaging
passed without my assistance, still
could my timing have been such that
I missed the crowds at every arrival?
Truly I am perplexed, for certainly,
onecan only acknowledge the lack of
hypocrisy at this fine center of the
Intelligentsia that so overwhelmingly
pervades numerous other institu-
tions.

Yes, certainly I am imagining
things; without doubt if I had
attended the festivities (excuse me,
demonstration) many would have
been the familiar faces-of Winter that
I would have witnessed, but no, I, in
my self-centered Bourgeoisisms, was
off partying elsewhere, snobbishingly
shrugging off any association with
the National, and so I can but
conjecture. That this is my punish-
ment, to wonder uncomprehendingly
from whenee the crowd emerged, from
what hidden enclosure they sprang
from that had been to my eyes, so
zealously secured during this last
(how shall we define that word)

Davidson National.
