Early in his life Mr. Franklin attended
this little schoolonly one day out of each
year spending the rest of his time work-
ing in the fields of his father. It was
during this period of his life that he be-
came acquainted with Dr. and Mrs.
Sloop, who were doing mission work
in this Grandfather Basin, and it was
from them that he received his first am-
bition for an education. From then on
he held the one idea before him of going
to school when he reached the age of
21, because his father had often warned

Frats Represented At
National Gathering

Pi Kappa Alpha, Scabbard and Blade,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon Send
Delegates

During the period following the Easter
holidays a number of delegates from
Davidson attended fraternity confer-
ences held in various parts of the coun-
try. Representatives from Davidson
went to the national convention of Pi
Kappa Alpha social fraternity and of
Scabbard and Blade honorary military
fraternity and to the province conven-
tion of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

E. M. Regen representing the chapter
of Pi Kappa Alpha located here at David-
son, attended the national meeting of
that organization. It was held in St.
Louis, Mo., at the Chase Hotel. Dr. H.
B. Arbuckle, of the Davidson faculty,
who is one of the fraternity’s Grand
Officers, also attended. :

W. C. Ramsey and J. L. Lake went to
Champagne, Ill, for the national meet-
ing of Scabbard and Blade which met
with the University of Illinois chapter.
This was the first time that any member
of the Davidson chapter had attended
this convention and the delegates found
the North and Mid-West better repre-
sented than any other sections although
representatives were come from every
part of the country.

W. Z. Bradford and E. S. Faison were
sent by the local chapter of Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon to the province convention
held at George Washington . University.
‘Besides Davidson and the host. chapter
the University of Virginia, Washington
and Lee University, University of North
Carolina, and Wofford College were rep-
resented,

themselves to the high roads and by-
paths of the country, engaging in the
noble and ignoble art of bumming, clas-
| sically known as “hoboing.” With packs

fon their backs, and dressed in old
clothes, they hied away to distant
places. The call of the “Great Un-

known,” distant places,——called!

To “Goat” Lewis is awarded the dia-
mond-studded ink bottle, for the dis-
tance record. Starting out, headed
South, he landed in Jacksonville, Fla.,
within two days, and could have gone
farther, if he hadn’t decided that he could
be “pushed so far, and no farther.” He
drove back with his family—which after
all is a degree of “bumming.”

Elkins has held that position, Elkins will
preside over the meeting.

The program prepared by W. B. Ter-
rell, editor of the Maroon and Gold, in-
cludes talks by several of the leading
newspaper men of the state. ApS;
Stockton, of the Greensboro Daily News
will be the main speaker. He has been
asked to discuss the writing of feature
and human-interest stories. Among
others, Warren McCullough, of Burling-
ton, will talk on the mechanics of a col-
lege paper, and Prof. H. Babcock, of Elon
on the preparation of the college literary
magazine. Various student members will
also address the delegates.

A feature of the convention will be the
round-table discussion groups on the
various phases of work on the publica-
tions. Thus an opportunity will be
given newspaper editors, business man-
agers, magazine editors, the heads of
the various departments to exchange
ideas and methods related to their par-
ticular line of effort.

All Teams of State Meet at Raleigh

This Week-End—Carolina is
Going Strong

As has already been announced, the
State intercollegiate track meet will be
held in Raleigh on Friday and Satur-

day, May 2nd and 3rd. Great interest in

this display of skill has grown annual-

ly; and the different honors awarded.to

the best in their respective feats has
done much to encourage the develop-
ment of real track men in this state. The
fact that everyschool in the state will
be represented at this meet is also evi-
dence that this branch of sport is fast
taking its just place among the other
sports.

This all-state meet should prove
be the best that has been held so far
as several records have been broken in
the state this season and such record-
breakers will exert every effort to take
home the laurels at this time. Davidson
will be represented by those men who
have shown real ability during the sea-
son and who are most likely to win
points where the best i nthe state are
contesting. Among those who have gain-
ed distinction on the cinder’ path two

On Concert Tour

The Dixieland Novelty Seven, together |

with Piggy Martin and the Quartet, gave
two very successful concerts last week.
The first was at Belmont Thursday
night. The ladies of the community gave
them a supper at which were many girls,
making the more enjoyable.
Saturday night a concert was held at
Red Springs, at Flora Macdonald.

For. sometime past, several organiza-

occasion

tions of Red Springs, including the
Woman's Club, Ladies’ Auxiliary and
the two upper classes of Flora Mac- |
donald, have attempted to have the

Davidson Glee Club there for a concert.
Finally, they all joined forces in putting
the affair on successfully, making ar-
rangements for the advertising, crowd
and entertainment of the members of the
Glee Club. The Senior Class of Flora

honor after the concert.

The program was nearly the same as
the regular Glee Club program, the en-
semble work being done by a double
quartet consisting of Liston Elkins, Ted
Jones and members of the orchestra.
The Dixie Novelty Seven doubled up on
their work thus filling the place of the
symphony orchestra. The quartet scored
a hit with three appearances. The au-
dience gave the orchestra a decided
