Films Sponsored |

By DAVID GRISSETT
Managing Editor

The Cocurricular , Council
this week began one of se-
veral new activities that it
has planned for more com-
pletely coordinated campus
programs.

The short films series be.

gan during lunch Wednesday
in the Morrison Room of the
College Union. ‘Moods of
Surfing"’ and Charlie Chap-

lin’s “Sparring Parther’’
were shown,
A series of such_ short

films is to be -shown during
lunch hours by sophomores
Robert Banta and Charlie
Williams.

Rich: Cowart, vice presi-
dent of Union Cocurricular,
stated that the next project

to be launched is the art
rental service.

This program features
twenty pieces purchased

from Lakeside Studios to be
rented by the term for a
small fee.’ Eleven pieces
have been framed and will
be on display soon in Cham-
ber's Lobby. :

Cowart said that Cocurri-
cular’s short term programs
are designed for “improving
by stimulating and co-ordi-
nating."’ He further stated
that presently. there is much
duplication of scheduling
and funding of various pro-
grams on campus.

Besides sponsoring stimu-

lating events and programs,

Cowart said that Cocurricu-

lar hopes to,be a fifth area

of the Extended Studies.

Programs such as a film
seminar with critical view-
ing and creating of films
could be submitted for credit
in the other areas, thereby
reducing the stress on_iso-
lated departments.

By relating several pro-
grams to a topic and to a
coordinated media pool, such
as the successful Vietnam
Week held last spring, Co-
curricular hopes to eliminate
the ‘secondary and hapha-
zard"’ learning experience
offered outside the class-
room, said Cowart.

The council has represen-
tatives from Free Universt-
ty, the Union, YMCA, the
art department, Black Stu-
dent Coalition, Radio Sta-
tion, and interested faculty
Rupert Barber and Fred-
erick Gaiige.

Open council meetings are
held in the Union Blue ‘Room
every Tuesday during lunch. ~
All those with ideas and sug-
gestions “are invited to at-
tend or post their ideas on
the Cocurricular bulletin
board now in the Union lob
by, Cowart said,

Cowart added that faculty
co-operation with Cocurri-
cular “has been excellent.”

Though there is no offi-
cial director for cocurricular
affairs, Cowart said that
College President Samuel
Spencer and others have con-
sidered the idea, but’ that: a
definite proposal has_ not
been made.

Students Enjoy Seminar Abroad

What do the stvdenis who:
spent their spring term last
year in Greece and Italy
think about studying classics

ture?

“Exciting is ,the word to
use,” says Mark Affeldt,
and his fellow — students
agree that it was an unfor-
gettable 72 days in high
gear. Sample their reactions
to this new program.

Greg Gandee: It was one
of the most educational,

_ well-spent things I've ever

done in my life — a worth-
while experience.

Roger—Powell;__We__ lived
and. ate classics. It was a
more intense program than
anything you get at David-
son.

‘Bob Wood: As far as a to-

‘tal learning experience-goes,

I don’t think Davidson can
equal the program_with any-

thing else — not even the. .

Tom Ross: ‘It’s.the great-

-est thing I ever did. I Jearn-

ed. more than I've ever

Jearned in a - period that

short before.
Affeldt; It was education-
al but-on a. different level. .

campus was good. It gives
you an opportunity to con-
tinue your: education out-

Dr. George Labban, travel-

short visits to Crete and
Turkey “during some free
time.

But what is it like trying
to pack a_ knowledge of
Southern Europe and thou-
sands of. years into” ten
weeks?

Ross: We worked hard,
but it was worth every min-
ute. 1 didn't even not.ce the
time. My education in cias
sics was so’ poor before I
went — I learned so much

about history, art, and even
modern situations.

Gandee: Some days it was
8:00 in the morning to 10:00
at night. You had to allow
an hour just to get to some
of the siles from where you
were staying. We had _ to
read a lot and classes were
long, but they were all out-

Sixty students showed their

‘the largest in its history.

Originally, it was planned

“.to make STEP somewhat

necessary to leave the pro-

This has had a determen-

classroom,

Wood: When you get be-
yond books and memorizing
facts you can still learn a
lot. Studying a ruin is much
more relevant when you're
sitting on top of it. 5

‘Powell: Take Miletus, for
example. You see rocks
sticking out of a flooded

* pasture, and this is all that

is left of a great civiliza-

Gandee: Greece was the
prettiest country I saw and
it had the friendliest people.
The food there was better
than anywhere else I went.
