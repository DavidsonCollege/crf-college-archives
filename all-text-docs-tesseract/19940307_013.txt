pa lecture:

Mozart's concertos

By Josh Larned

Students and faculty members
with a fancy for classical music
were treated to a lecture renowned
musicologist Joseph Kerman
Thursday night. Kerman, Profes-
sor of Music at Berkeley, was
speaking as part of the Phi Beta
Kappa lecture series.

With a smooth voice and a
sharp sense of humor, Kerman gen-
tly guided his listeners through
Mozart’s concertos. Referring to
these particular works as “the syn-
thesis of the composer’s art,” the
scholar acknowledged their tre-
mendous legacy which can be seen
in “today’s supermarkets and
Celicas.”

However, Kerman employed
a novel approach to the Austrian

composer by, “relating the concer-
tos to the historical situation in
which they appeared.” In doing
so, Kerman vividly described the
rich musical scene in late eigh-
teenth-century Vienna’ and
Mozart’s successful attempt tocap-
tivate the city’s discriminating au-
dience through his concertos.

Kerman attributed Mozart’s
success to the fact that he “single-
handedly developed the art of dia-
logue in the concerto.” He then
proceeded to dissect the general
form of the composer’s concertos
in a simple anc direct fashion that
listeners not extensively trained in
musical appreciation could easily
comprehend.

In his analysis, Kerman
pointed out the fluid and graceful

relationship between the solo and
the orchestra that made Mozart’s
concertos so unique for their time.
In particular, Kerman examined
Mozart’s Concerto in C Minor in
order to exemplify this character-
istic.

Kerman clearly felt that
Mozart’s concertos contain numer-
ous elements which can be appre-
ciated by almost everyone.

In conclusion, he shared a
quote by actress Joan Crawford
that aptly explains Mozart’s con-
tribution to the concerto: “I like
some symphonies, but I love all
concertos.” Kerman’s lecture made
it apparent that it was largely be-
cause of Mozart that this musical
form has become so popular
through time.

The spirit is rising at Davidson

Spirit continued from page 11

the games and yell my head off.”

During the middle of fall se-
mester, sophomores Gray Dyerand
Dave Fischer recruited students
from the music department and
began putting the band together.

Drummer Karl Ruch says,
“The music involves participation
and brings excitement. The noise

gets people excited.”
Fischer says, “I love to watch
the Wildcats play. If I can add
something to the game, I will.”

The band has given a dimen-
- sion to the games that was lacking
in previous years. Francis says,
“The band creates a big-school at-
mosphere.”

The band travelled to the
UNC-Charlotte game and to Ap-
palachian State University in Feb-
tuary. Dyer said, “The ASU fans
definitely felt our presence because
of our spirit and our cheering.”

Roachal Laney, ASU athletic
director, said that in twenty years,
only twice has an opposing team

brought their pep band. Both times,
that band was Davidson’s.

The band travelled this past
weekend to the conference tourna-
ment in Asheville and played an
integral part in cheering on the
team...

Fischer believes that next year
the band “should grow. We hope
to have a lot of freshman recruit-
ing.”

The Dance Team
“In the past, spirit at Davidson
was a struggle,” Scire says.

For years, cheerleading squads
were unsuccessful. In 1991, Scire
decided to try another option: a
dance team.

Junior Sara Withers, co-cap-
tain of the 16-member team, says,
“It’s a good opportunity to dance
and to add tothe spirit of the games.
If we get excited, others will too.”

Sophomore Beth Lindsey, also
a co-captain, says, “We’ve been
sitting on the court during the sec-
ond half, helping the mascot do
cheers.”

Scire says that this year’s team

took a dance class in Mooresville
and learned dances from a chore-
ographer. They performed at all
basketball games in Belk Arena
and at the UNC-Charlotte game in
Independence Arena. Last week-
end, for the second consecutive
year, the team performed at the
Southern Conference tournament.

Scire sees bright prospects for
the dance team: “I’m excited and
optimistic about what I see for the

future. I hope we have dancers
coming out of the woodwork.”
_. The Mascot

For three years, senior Greg
Fisher has worn the Wildcat mas-
cot costume at athletic events.
Fisher says, “I’ve always enjoyed
acting. This is a form of acting.”

He sees his role as providing
fun and spirit for fans. “I provide
comic relief and represent
Davidson,” Fisher says.

In the costume, Fisher can do
things he normally would not do:
“During halftime, Dean Terry came
out to mid-court, and I rubbed the
top of his head.”

EP, the California-based band
Pavement has returned with a new
LP entitled Crooked Rain,
Crooked Rain.

The new album, which fea-
tures 12 original songs, is a solid
effort with only a few mistakes.
This is one group that does not
often play it safe. Their willing-
ness to take musical risks means
that Pavement can play some of
the most original and engaging
music around. Unfortunately, it
also means that when they miss,
they miss big, as on the discor-
dant “Stop Breathin’”and the ill-
advised jazz send-up “5/4 =
Unity.”

Pavement’s sound is in some
ways similar to contemporaries
Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh. Guitar
tones tend to be trebly (though not
always as distorted as those used
by Din. Jr) and distinctively
Fender-esque. This tone works
well on songs such as “Silence
Kid” but sounds a little too sparse
at other times. The album is well-
produced and features a pleasant

Music Reivew
By Tom Mew balance of vocals and instruments.
Following up on the success In general, the songs tend toavoid
of their debut album, Slanted and _ thetraditional verse-chorus-verse
Enchantedand Watery, Domestic form and also feature several dis-

tinct melodies within a single
tune.

Songs such as “Unfair” and
“Range Life” prove that Pave-
ment can write a strongly me- |.
lodic tune without resorting to
hackneyed songwriting formulas.
Certain songs, however, could
benefit from more structure.
“Stop Breathin’,” in particular,
meanders aimlessly before finally
settling into cacophonous and
repetitious solo guitar lines. The
band redeems itself with
standouts such as “Gold Soundz”
and “Cut Your Hair”—a humor-
ous take on the importance of

. hairstyle in the music business.

This is generally a strong
album featuring some ambitious
songwriting and guitar perfor-
mance. Pavement’s desire tocre-
ate original and distinctive music
seems to have led to great suc-
cess. The bad songs on this al-
bum (and there are only a few)
are truly terrible, but one listen to
“Gold Soundz” will make you
forget you ever complained.
