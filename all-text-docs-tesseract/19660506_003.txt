Smith Hails Hungry D
As Unqualified Success

By BILLY FARR
Davidsonian Staff Writer
The Hungry D night club's

first week can best be described
as a great success, according
to C. Shaw Smith, Union di-
rector. ‘‘Good talent, good food,
good music, atmosphere and
friends made it the success it
was.’ he said. |

Smith stated that over 750 peo-
ple attended during the five
nights it was in operation, and
many had to be turned away
for lack of room.

He also emphasized, “Or
course our greatest thanks go
to Fred Smoot, the unifier, the
known quantity in’ the experi-
ment. The other factors had to
be proved.”

In fact, more people attended
Friday night’s two shows than
The Womenfolk’s concert dur-
ing Springs Frolics.

The club had been widely ad-
vertised: it drew its patronage
from students, faculty and
townspeople. Dr. Henry Lilly,
professor emeritus of English,
summed up the evening by say-
ing, ‘It sure was fun.”

The night club, featuring com-

edian Fred Smoot, was under-
written by general Union funds.
However, the “‘take’’ proved that
entertainment of this type costs
much less than any single ap-
pearance by an artist on a dance
weekend, Smith said..

The Hungry D represents a
new concept in on-campus en-
tertainment and has apparent-
ly aroused much interest at
other colleges. Smith has been
in contact with people from
Duke and UNC, among others,
who are interested in establish-
ing a campus night club cir-
cuit next year.

Officials from schools in Flor-
ida, Minnesota, and California
have called concerning this new
approach to campus entertain:
ment. One man in New York
has offered to buy into the pro-
posed college circuit in North
Carolina, Smith said.

The news coverage of the
event was excellent, Smith con-
tinued. A highly compliment-
ary review appeared in The
Charlotte Observer. WSOC-TV
carried a report on the Hun--
gry D on its Tuesday evening
news program. ,

Phi Eta Sigma Initiates
15 Into Membership

Twelve freshmen and three
sophomores were initiated into
Phi Eta Eigma, the freshman
scholastic honorary fraternity,

during ceremonies at Phi Hall-

Tuesday afternoon.

Criterion for membership in
the fraternity, a national or-
ganization, is a 2.6 average in
either the first semester, or first
two semesters.

The freshmen initiated were
Charlie Baker, Dick Chandler,
Paul Gallis, Robbie Hooker,
Berkley. Latimer, David Mor-
row, Mike Payne, Randy Phil-
lips, Bill Thomson, Bruce Weid-
ner, Bill Williams and Dale
Vash.

Chuck Byrd, Woody Faulk and
Bryce McLaughlin, sopho-
mores, were also initiated.

In a general business session
afterwards, the fraternity elect-
ed as its new officers Chris
Hawk, president; Kirk Reed,
vice-president; Bill Williams,
secretary; and Frank Fleming,
treasurer. In addition, Reed was
chosen to represent the David-
son chapter at the national con-
vention at Auburn next Oct. 31-

Nov, 2.

This plan could change the
whole outlook toward entertain-
ment at Davidson. It will pro-
vide more people with more
chances to enjoy performances
by outstanding new artists. The
night club idea provides an ex-
cellent opportunity for students
to release tensions by having
clean fun and having it fast,
Smith stressed.

As yet the Union has not con-
clusively lined up entertainers
for proposed shows next year,
though several are being consid-
ered. The Hungry D is look-
ing for new, exciting comedy,
music and novelty acts of a
quality that will insure the con-
tinued success of the night club
idea at Davidson. ‘‘We will wel-
come any suggestions from stu-
dents in helping us find the
talent we need,’ Smith con-
cluded.
