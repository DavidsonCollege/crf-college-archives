Gullibiliry and Sponges

The world is full of educated sponges.
These intellectual phenomena absorb any
printed matter and voiced opinion, retain-
ing unchanged all that is read and heard,
and bring forth its contents, when
squeezed, for an intellectual appraisal of
world conditions. the true nature of socie-
ty, or the view of an infallible textbook.
They believe anything that they read and
hear, often accepting the first opinion
expressed or the first fact presented as a
rightful concept of the subject in question.
Today, much is printed, much is said;
thereby creating a great need to go be:
yond the obvious, a need for objective and
critical analyses to discern what is fiction,
what is fact, what. is truth.

It is most often a two-way fallacy
since most voices of fact and opinion
present only one set of facts and one slant
of opinion. This applies to magazine
articles, newspaper material, chapel talks,
textbooks, and even some professors. Take
the following examples from widely read
publications.

“Another African student told me
recently, ‘I am a member of the Mau
Mau movement. It is our national move-
ment for liberation.’ People who enjoy the
fruits of freedom. and stability often look
at these struggles in a negative or passive
way. But our oneness with humanity de-
mands that we identify ourselves with
those who desire freedom . . . The truths
which were self-evident to Thomas Jeffer-
son and Tom Paine have, in the Provi-
dence of God and through the logical
evolution of events. become self-evident
to Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta, Dr.
Nnamdi Azikiwe and the leaders of the
-African National Congress."

The Intercollegian, October, 1955

Compare that to these excerpts from
Newsweek:

“Barely 7 miles from the governor’s
palace in Nairobi, a group of African gun-
men last week staged 4 murder in the best
Hollywood gangster style. They shot down
Senior Chief Waruhiu of the 1,000,000
strong Kikuyu tribe in broad daylight as
he parked his car outside a church mis-
sion. ‘The killers fled in a waiting automo-
bile. Waruhiu was killed for having de-
nounced a secret society called the Mau
Mau. He was the 26th murder (including
two white women stabbed to death) com-
mitted by the Mau Mau this year.”

Newsweek, October 20, 1955

“A Kikuyo tribal headsman who had
remained loyal to the British in Kenya
returned home from a night of duty on
guard against Mau Mau terrorists. He
found his wife and four of his children
chopped to bits by the long knives of the
Mau Mau.

“This bloody incident was only one of
many last week as a fresh wave of atroci-
ties marked the conclusion of the trial of
Jomo (Burning Spear) Kenyalta, whom
the British accused of organizing the Mau
Mau movement. The court was a converted
schoolroom .. . in the desolate waste of
northern Kenya. .. . the sentence . . . an
inadequate sentence of seven years.”

Newsweek, April 20, 1953

And there is more recently the case
of Emmett Till so dynamically presented,
thanks to a thoughtful observer, on the
bulletin board in the College Union. On
one side there is IN MEMORIAM by Life
Magazine which while quoting often from
the Scriptures states that Emmett’s “sol-
dier-father was killed in France fighting
for the American proposition that all men
are equal.”

Life, October 10, 1955

On the other side from the Charleston
Courier comes this statement: “Till’s
father was hanged in Italy during the war
for murder and rape.”

News and Courier, October 16, 1955

It is a fault of most publications and
commentators to present only one side.
It is a greater fault to accept and be satis-

fied with only one presentation of the
matter. It is difficult 'to break away from
traditional approaches, methods and
views. Part of education is discernment,
intelligent analyses, and a striving for ob-
jectivity. Drink from the fount of infor-
mation and opinion not. with a bucket but
with a well-placed straw.—R. H. M.

A Solved Problem?

Through the last few years no sub.
ject, not even subsidization, has been the
object of more editorial discussion than
chapel and chapel conduct. This editor
has actually had members of the admin-
istration point out to him that nothing
had been printed about chapel for over
two weeks. Clearly this is one of the most
acute problems that has faced the cor-
porate Davidson family for several years.

The chapel uproar is quieted now. No
longer does this subject blemish the se-
date conversation of those whom it con-
cerns. What is its status now?

Chapel is now held on three days a
week, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. The
elimination of the Wednesday chapel is
in no sense, according to the chapel com-
mittee, an indication of a reduced religious

emphasis on the campus. Quite .o tlie con-.

trary, they feel that three well planned
religious exercises per week would be
much more meaningful than four routine
chapel services.

Chapel conduct is much improved
now from its status of two years ago. This
has resulted from Dr. Cunningham’s de-
termined “get tough” policy of late spring
1954. No longer are students “passed
back” during the services, and the ‘noise,
jeering, whooping, laughter, and general
commotion do not mar the entire service.
But is chapel conduct really passable. yet
alone good, even today?

Let us look at the chapel program
thus far this year. Most of the services
have been of the “long chapel" variety,
lasting from three-fourths to all of the
alloted time. Phychologically this is un-
doubtedly for the best. if the chapel pro-
gram is to be carried on at all. Moreover,
no thoughtful student should object to
this considering the complete freedom
which he enjoys two days a week: com-
pared to five days interrupted by chapel
programs of unpredictable. length two
years ago.

Some of the programs do indeed show
evidence of careful planning. On the other
hand, some of the programs do not show
strong evidence along this line. Certainly,
if- the religious programs are to be valu-
able and meaningful. they will have to
be carefully planned, and this should ever
be kept foremost in the minds of the com-
mittee members. The committee has indi-
cated its intention to meet regularly, and
for this they are to be commended.

Although in general the student con-
duct has improved to the point where it
is no longer farcial or even downright ir-
religious to hold a chapel! service, the situ-
ation is still bad. Last Friday’s chapel was
almost as bad as any held last year. The
whooping between the prayer and the
hymn was completely unexcusable. It is
not stretching matters to say that the
students act like immature children or
wild animals at anytime that announce-
ments are made. The most serious mistake
made by the chapel committee is to allow
announcements of any kind whatsoever to
be made on Tuesdays and Thursdays, no
matter how great the emergency. Those
chanel periods at which no announcements
have been made are the only ones at
which a genuine religious atmosphere has
existed.

However, the foregoing comment is
worthless. We are resigned that no chapel
plan, regardless of how well conceived,
how well planned, or how well carried out,
it may be, will ever succeed in the present
atmosphere. However, the blame for the
problem can be so clearly laid on one
group, the Davidson student body. Until
they as a whole come to realize the child-
ishness, the immaturity, the disrespect,
the impiety, and the ingratitude of their
conduct and resolve to do better the situa-
tion will not be improved.—T. W. W.

French Colonial Policy in Fi
Near East--Beginning or End?)|

Most of us Davidsonians have
come to know the Mediterranean
as a cultural center, the very
cradle of our western civilization.
War has often been called the nor-
mal situation within our culture,
and the Mediterranean certainly
contributes its share to keep the
situation as “normal” as possible.

During the past few weeks we
have again heard the old, familiar
names of Morocco, Algeria, Egypt
and Israél mentioned in an old,
familiar context—internal and ex-
ternal friction; resulting in fight-
ing on smaller or larger scale. As
if these old and proven disputes
were not enough, new restlessness
has been stirred on the island of
Cyprus.

We have been accustomed to
hear Tunisia mentioned in this.
connection but this time that an-
cient base of pirates has remained
peaceful, due to its new form of
government, which it got only this
summer. According to a plan, con-
ceived by Mendes France, Tunisia
will eventually get complete inde-
pendence, and this plan has satis-
fied the population, thus keeping
at least that corner of the cracking
French Empire in calm: Both na-
tional extremists and Communists
of course have presented more rad:
ical demands, but the French good-
will after the italian occupation, to-
gether with the more concrete ac-
tion, like giving over 3 billion
franes worth of relief to the fam-
ine-stricken country, have been
enough to quiet them.

The problem of Morocco and Al-
geria is more complicated, especial-
ly because of the numerous French
settlers living there, who have
taken an extremely firm stand
against any demands made by the
Mohammedan population. The ques-
tion is not only of the Moham-
medan riots, where they have cut
innocent men's noses and necks;
also the white have made them-
selves guilty to similar atrocities.
The white section of the population
has its representatives in the Na-
tional Assembly, and they have
been to a great extent responsible
for the recent development. The

French do not yet want to believe ©

the: truth. declared by Mendes-
France, that the days of colonialism
are behind, and to be successful,
at all, the colonial policy has to be
more liberal, considering more the
needs and desires of the colonies
also.

The origin of the tumult in
Morocco. and Algeria is in
unanimous movement against Sul-
tan Mohammed ben Jussuf. He was
accused of heresy, and all Mo-
hammedans were ready to resort to
arms to expel! him. The French
readily gave a helping hand to the
righteous ones, especially when it
was a well--known secret that Mo-
hammed ben Jussuf had been the
secret leader of the extreme Na-
tionalist party, the Istiqlal, for 14
years.

The new ruler, Sultan Moham-
med ben Moulay Arafa, who in the
beginning was exceedingly popu-
lar because of his social reforms,
has lost his popularity because of
his willingness to cooperate with
the French, and consequently the
people want Mohammed ben Jussuf
back. He is, however, exiled in
Madagascar, and the French are
not likely lo support his return; in
fact he is virtually their prisoner.

The main issue, however, is the
tense situation between the French
and the Mohammedan population.

the ©

According to a United States sen-
ator, five Arabian. oil-sheiks have
given 20 million dollars to support
anti-French agitation, and the Com-
munists naturally were delighted
to give their finaneial support in
an emergency like this. For obvious
reasons we do not know the exact
amount, but the writer is con-
vinced, that it was considerably
more than given to the supporting
of the victims of recent Pennsyl-
vania floods.

‘ Keeping this financial support in
mind, it is no wonder, that the
hatred eventually reached _ its
height in the recent riots. In fact,
the hostilities reached such a scale,
that France had to send 120,000
men to return everything to order.

Obviously this kind of armed

peace was considered too expensive

by the French, and consequently
they promised some reforms, which
in our eyes, however, look rather
superficial and pitifully late. In
spite of the resistance of the Al-
gerian French, France is going so
far as to make the Arabian lan-
guage a subject in State schools,
to stop supervising the religious
activities of the Mohammedans. In
addition a promise has been given
to give to at least one out of three
European children an opportunity
to go at least to grade school. That
proportion does not certainly look
too impressive, but we have to re-
member, that only one out of 125
Mohammedan children has the
chance to get elementary education.

A real war was going to start
between Israe] and Egypt. On the
now famous Gaza strip, Egypt had
an army composed of the refugee-
Arabs from Israel; and the Arab
soldiers got too homesick. They
started sending patrols to Israel,
to see their old homes and at the
same time killing any Jew they
met. Israel reciprocated, and soon
the UN truce commission had its
hands full in trying to prevent
30,000 Israel soldiers from attack-
ing 15,000 Egyptian soldiers. Both
armor and airplanes were already
in use, before the pressure from
both UN and USA brought about
a new truce.

But it must have been written
in the stars, that there would be
ro peace in the Mediterranean. Al-
¢eady since last December, when
the UN refused to take the case
of Cyprus under discussion, the
Greeks have done everything possi-
ble to get the British ousted from
the island. Archbishop Makarias
has been in the lead of the anti-
British movement, using the church
as a means of agitation, and get-
ting support especially from stu-
dents. Of the half million peo
ple population four-fifth are Greek
and the rest, 100,000 are of Turkish
origin, and have formed a secret
pro-Turkish league of their own.

When the British offered inde-
pendence to the island, Greeks got
mad, because that was not enough,
and Turkey got mad, because the
offer was too advantageous to
Greeks. As‘a result there were
anti-Greek riots in Izmir, where the
eastern headquarters of NATO are
situated, and the opposite reaction
was recorded in Salonika.

As for the possible outcome, we
advise the reader to draw his own
conclusions basing his judgment on
recent development in the colon-
jal world. As our own reaction, we

feel secure enough to say, that in ©

this case, as in politics generally,
‘patience is the best means to find
the right outcome. Time will show.

Detailed Operation of College
Bookstore Bared for the Record

In recent weeks concern over
the price of textbooks in the Col-
lege Bookstore seems to have
reached a peak. Many of the stu-
dents feel that the bookstore ‘is
charging exorbitant rates for these
books and that consequently the
college is making a tremendous
profit.

One of the greatest bones of
contention is that the students may
buy the same books in Charlotte for
a twenty-five per cent discount un.
der the price of the books here.

After inquiring into the question,
I have found that the problem is
a quite complex one. Involved is
an appreciation for the accounting
involved in running any business
and a knowledge of the financial
set-up of a college like Davidson.

Briefly the story is this. The
bookstore_is run as a service to the
students, but must make enough
gross profit to take care of paying
postage on the books, making up
for money lost when textbooks are.
changed, and paying a nominal fee
to those who work in the store.
Nothing is charged the bookstore
by the college for rent or utilities.
To assure this profit the books are
marked up 20 per cent (the usual
in.any bookstore) over the publish-
er’s price to the bookstore.

The publisher charges the book-
store an average of fifteen cents
per book in shipping costs which
must come out of this profit. This
fee, of course, depends upon the
size of the book.

One of the biggest losses to the
bookstore comes when a textbook
is changed by a professor or when
an author brings out a new edition
of his text, making the old edition
obsolete. In the first case the book-
store has to sell all the copies of
the book that they have on hand to
a second hand dealer for about 40
percent of the purchase price. In
the latter the book is only worth
.50 to $1.00, if it can be sold at all.
The store loses approximately $500

per year in this way I personally

*Gross profit

feel that this loss is quite justifi-
able in that it signifies that the
students have available at all times
the best materials for acquiring a
high calibre education.

You may have wondered why
those who work in the bookstore
cannot be paid from the same fund
as those who work in the admin-
istrative offices. The complete an-
swer to this would involve a
thorough understanding of the fi-
nancial organization of the college.
More simply we might say that this
is a separate department just as
the laundry is and its employees
are not paid from the general fund,
just as the laundry’s are not. Cer-
tainly, however, they do have to
be paid something for their time,
and this too has to come out of
the gross profit of the store.

Thus, for an average year with
$22,000 gross sales, I have figured
that a bricf approximate financial
statement would be as follows:

$4,400

Postage and handling
of books

Loss on obsolete
books sold to
second hand
dealers

Salaries to clerks
and manager

$ 500

500

1,250
$2,250 2,250

Net proft $2,150

The entire net profit is turned
over to the college scholarship fund
each year and has been instru-
mental in providing an education
at Davidson for many who could
not otherwise have afforded it. If
this money were not available from
this source for the scholarships, it
would come from some other area
of the college income and might
very well cause an eventual raise
in tuition.

These records shoutd make it ob-
vious to the students that neither
the college nor any individual is

WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING:

Opinions and Appraisals of
The American College Scene

(The following are excerpts from
the fall edition of WHAT THE
COLLEGES ARE DOING, @ publi-
cation of Ginn and Company, which
seeks to record an accurate picture
of college and ‘university life and
opinion in the United States to-
day.)

Today's Student Liberal

As everyone knows, higher edu-
cation has become _ increasingly
democratized. It is no longer the
haven for an intellectual elite. The
majority of students come to col-
lege looking for the know-how that
will enable them to live a comfort-
able suburban existence. They want
to adjust to the material values
held by the most vocal segment of
the population. The student intel-
lectual, faced with his fears for
the future, and not wishing to dis-
turb the order of the present, tends
more and more, as he looks with
some disgust. at the non-(if not an-
ti-) intellectuals who surround him,
even in the classroom, to retreat.
His retreat may lead him into a
pedantic scholarship or into a mys-
tic embrace with an ancient re-
ligion, or, perhaps, even into the
writing of science fiction .. .

But what of the student liberal,
who is not quite of the vanished
breed he is thought to be? Al-
though he exists, his ideas are no
longer as exciting to his contem-
poraries as they were in the con-
fident years when the future still
seemed to promise a Utopia. Hence
his audience is now smaller and
less easily stirred.

Once liberalism seemed to offer
both a clear view of a new (and
better) world and the ideas with
which to meet its challenge. But
liberal thought today has been
busy with the fight to keep us
from regressing or, to put it more
positively, to preserve the hard
won social gains of this century. It
has scarcely had time to fulfill its
traditional role as a guide to fu-
ture action.

Like the adult, the student liberal
can only hope to go on searching
for the answers which will appeal
to the nation—answers which may
not be found .. Each college gen-
eration tries, as best it can, to get

on in a world it never made. My
generation has chosen to ride out
a storm on what seems to be the
safe island of the present. I, along
with many others, think we should
move off it, before the island is in-
undated. I don't know where to go,
though; I only know the sea wall
doesn't look very safe.—Richerd
Schickel, Graduate Student, Univer-
sity of Wisconsin. From The Pro-
gressive,

Small College vs. Large

Some students would grow and
even flourish almost anywhere;
others seem immune to the whole
educational process, no matter how
or where it is conducted. But the
vast majority fall in between the.
two extremes: some of them are
fitted by temperament and back-
ground to thrive at the small col-
lege, and others at the big univer-
sity. So it may be worthwhile to
ponder the advantages of each.

The big university, for one thing,
can command and keep top teach-
ing talent in an amazing variety of
fields. . . . In higher education,
there is no substitute for either
quality or variety .. A university
or college without first-rate teach-
ers is no college. or university at
all, no matter how grandiose its
buildings or how bulging its treas-
ury...

But... if the “great teachers”
appear only infrequently before
large lecture courses, or only in
advanced courses to which admis-
sion is difficult, where is the edu-
cational profit to the average un-
dergraduate?

It is here that the small college
scores a point, and an important
one. For the student at the small
college has a dozen opportunities
to get acquainted with his teachers
for every one that he would have
at a big university. This is not, 1
hasten to add, because of any lack
of cordiality or goodwill toward
their students on the part of univer-
sity teachers as compared with col-
lege teachers. It is rather a matter
of tension versus comparative relax-
ation. University professors in a
metropolis (and no one knows it
better than their students) are
swamped with work. One result is
that their students approach them,

making a profit irom the store.

Many still may not be able to
understand why the prices in Char-
lotte are so much lower than those
of the bookstore—in fact, in some
cases lower than the price the book-
store pays the publisher for the
book. I have not as yet been able
to find any conclusive answer to
this problem. Surely one thing
which contributes to this fact is
that when a student buys in Char.
lotte, he has to order the book and
wait about two weeks for it to come
in, while here at Davidson the book
has already been conveniently
ordered and is on hand. This re-
sults in the student’s being able to
use the book from the first day of
the course, and a subsequent loss
to the bookstore if all those on
hand are not bought before the
text for the course changes or
new edition is brought out.

The college is already investi-
gating ways in which the books
may be bought chéaper as they
obviously are in Charlotte. I be-
lieve that they would do well to try
to buy their books from the same
source and pass on a saving thus
made to the student.

Actually the Davidson student is
much more fortunate than the stu-
dents in some of our neighboring
schools where the student is re-
quired to buy a text for every
course he takes from the college
bookstore and does not have the
opportunity to save on second hand
books that he can buy from other
students.

The bookstore at Davidson is run
at a maximum of efficiency and
provides a maximum of conven-
ience to the students In buying
their textbooks. It is not obligatory
that the student purchase his books
here and if he feels that he can
get them elsewhere at a great sav-
ings without suffering undue in-
convenience by not having a text
of his own for the first couple of
weeks in a course, then he should
feel encouraged to do so.

if at all, in a mood of “I know I
shouldn’t bother you about this,
but . . .” A small college teacher
senses much less of that kind of
hesitation.

For the student who needs teach-
ing stimulus and guidance to bring
him up to the university level, the
small college has it “all over” the
big university, in my opinion. It
must strive constantly, however, to
see that its relatively relaxed intel-
lectual atmosphere does not be
come relaxed to the point of slum-
bering mediocrity. It should expect
an ever-greater degree of maturity
and intellectual interest in its stu-
dents, hoping thereby to gain some
of the adult verve and vigor of the
big university without sacrificing
the intimacy’ and friendliness of
the small college. — Dr. Harold
A. Larrabee, Union College. From
the Union Colfege Aiumni Review.

Twin Goals of
Liberal Arts

Without attempting here the im-
possibility of conclusive proof, 1
suggest that the American liberal
arts college (including the church
colleges) can find a significant,
even unique, mission in the quality
of its historic purpose: to see men
made whole in both competence
and conscience. Is there any other
institution at the highest level of
organized educational activity that
is committed by its history and by
its program to these twin goals?

This is not to say that our great
professional and technical insti-
tutions or the graduate schools of
arts and sciences are something less
than the liberal arts college, but
rather that they have set them-
selves a different task — the mis-
sion of developing a special com-
petence. Nor am I unaware that
these institutions and the liberal
arts colleges are borrowing more
and more from each other and may
be moving toward each other in
approaching a closer integration of
all higher education. But my point
is that the historic liberal arts
college has had a unique mission
and that this mission has reality
and validity today.—President John
Stoan Dickey, Dartmouth College.
