THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 18, 1921.

THIRTY-FIVE MEN PRESENT
AT FIRST MEETINGS
OF MISSION STUDY CLASSES

Two Mission Study classes have been
started under the auspices of the Stu-
dent Volunteer Band. Dr. H. B. Ar-
buckle and Major T. G. Hearn have been
secured to lead these groups. They will
discuss the opportunities and problems
of Medical and Industrial Missions. °

At 10 o’clock last Sunday morning 35
men attended the opening meeting of
these classes, and from all reports much
interest was stirred up by both teachers.

Dr. Arbuckle has Bishop Lamburth’s
book on Medical Missions, and Major
Hearn is teaching “Ancient Peoples at
Modern Tasks,” by Price. As last Sun-
day’s meeting was taken up with intro-
ductory matter, the lesson next Sunday
morning will be the first chapter in each
book.

These classes will be especially inter-
esting to laymen as they will be con-
ducted by laymen, and will be not only
a study of Missions, but also a study of
international relations.

OBERLIN GRADUATE TO CON-
DUCT “Y” SERVICE SUNDAY

E. C. Hoffman, an Oberlin graduate
and at present the Community “Y” man

at Salisbury will talk to the Y. M. C. A.

next Sunday night. During the war Mr.
Hoffman was engaged in welfare work
in Manchuria and Siberia. Those who
were at Blue Ridge last summer will re-
member him and his smiling countenance
at most of the conferences held there.
They will also remember his boek “The
Higher Life.” which was used extensive-
ly there.

Mr. Hoffman is a man that all the fel-
lows will be glad to hear as he is not
only a six-footer and good athlete, but
also a clear thinker and good speaker,
who can see life and its pleasures from
the college man's point of view.

DWIGHT CHALMERS
SPEAKS TO STUDENTS OF
GREENSBORO COLLEGES

Dwight Chaimers went to Greensboro
last Sunday to help in missionary meet-
ings in N. C. C. W. and Greensboro Col-

Philadelphia, Penna. lege, being etitertained in the home of

' Rev. R. W. Miles, our former “Y” Sec-
‘retary. Sunday afternoon he was one of
the speakers in an open Student Volun-
teer Band meeting at N. C. College, at-
tended by some 50 of the students. Sev-
eral of the members of the Band dis-
cussed the Student Volunteer Move-
ment and Chalmers closed the mecting
with a talk on “The Challenge of Mis-
sions.”

The Greensboro College Y. W. C. A.
service that evening, attended by a much
larger crowd, was very similar to the
afternoon meeting. Miss Ethel Bost ex-
piained the Student Vulunteer Move-
ment and Miss Mable Stamper and
Edith Ader told why they had become
Volunteers. Chalmers then closed the
meeting as before with a challenge to
personal service.

VOLUNTEER BAND SENDS
OUT TWO DEPUTATIONS

Last Sunday J. C. Wool and Ted Jones
spoke on Missions at Harrisburg and
, Back Creek churches, and L. P. Burney
‘and W. F. Beck talked on the same sub-
ject in two churches at Woodleaf. Re-
ports from both of these deputations
say that the congregations were very
responsive and that the young people
especially showed great interest in the
jwork, There was a great demand for the
literature on missions that the boys took
with them, and the supply ran out in
both places.

\Christian Activities

DAVIDSON C. E. SOCIETIES ,

(Continued from page 1)
of the high school age. Mr. Beaty has
been doing fine work in his department
of the State Union and will have some
worth-while plans for Intermediates.

Mr. O. J. Allison, Vice-Chairman of the
Davidson Convention Committee, and
former president of the Western Dis-
trict of the State Union, will have charge
of the convention singing. This is
enough to say to the Davidson students
and those others who know him.

The Delegates.

Each of tle 75 societies in the district
is being allowed to register two dele-
gates. It is expected that this will bring
a delegation of 75 to 100 young people to
Davidson. The number of visitors will
make another interesting time for the
Davidson students and townspeopte. The
students are cordially invited to attend
the meetings and to get acquainted with
the visitors.

Mr. Charles F, Evane

The Program.

The convention will open Saturday
afternoon the 26th. Following the devo-
tional service and the addresses of wel-
come by Frank Toney for the local
Endeavors and Dwight Chalmers for the
college Y. M. C. A. and students, and the
response by one of the visitors, work
for the Juniors and Intermediates will
be taken up. At this time the Davidson
Juniors will give a playlet, “The Child-
ren’s Claim,” emphasizing the need for
Junior Societies,

At the close of the afternoon session
the delegates will be conducted over the
campus and shown the interesting spots,
including “Woody's Old Hole.” At seven
o’clock the Endeavorers and ladies of
Davidson will! entertain the delegates at
a picnic supper at the gymnasium. Here
a bountiful supply of good things to cat
and a jolly good time will be had.

Mr. Frank Wilson

At the Saturday night session the Rev.
Mr. Iverson will address the convention.
There will also be interesting discussions
of the coming state and world conven-
tions and the various plans which pro-
mote the work of the Endeavor soci-
eties. An effort is being made to secure
a stereopticon lecture on Southern and
National Christian Endeavor activities,
including work in prisons, in shops, and
in leper colonies.

Sunday School will be held at ten
o'clock Sunday morning, and at the reg-

ular church hour Dr. Richards will de-
liver the convention sermon.

The Sunday afternoon session will be
given to snappy one-minute reports from
the societies on the best Work done dur-
ing the past year, to an address by Mr.
Evans, and to a conference on methods
of work.

Sunday evening a model Christian
Endeavor meeting will be held. At the
night session another devotional serv-
ice, another address, and the closing
consecration service, the vital time of
the convention, will bring to a close the
interesting meetings.
