Ten seniors to play last career game Saturday

By MARK CLAYTON

Football teams always talk about family.
The players see their teammates as brothers,
and Davidson football is no different. This
Saturday, the Davidson football family is
losing 10 of its brothers. The 1 p.m. kickoff
at Georgetown will conclude the careers of
Yeatts Anderson 06, Alex Arinsmier ’06,
Ryan Amold ’06, Ricky Childers ’06, Elliott
Culter ’06, John Green ’06, Preston Moore
’06, Brian Purcell ’06, Jake Rice ’06, and
Jordan Sundheim ’06.

One thing that sets this group of seniors
apart from any other class in recent years is
the adversity that they have been though
together.

Many changes have taken place over the
four years during which these ’Cats have
donned the red and black. They have experi-
enced the increased competition level of the
Davidson football schedule, in which the
Wildcats removed Division III schools to
add 1-AA scholarship and Patriot League
teams. This group has also dealt with the
transition of a new head coach in their senior
season. All of these players were recruited by
the old regime, but they still led the charge of
the Tripp Merritt era.

Most impressive is the fact that these men
carried the torch for their class.

When these seniors came into preseason
camp as freshman in 2002, they were 10 of
23 total first-years. As a result of multiple
career-ending injuries and personal deci-
sions, only 10 of those 23 will play travel to
D.C. on Saturday.

This group might not have brought home a
PFL Championship in their years or an unde-

feated season like the 10-0 ’Cats in 2002, but
they never gave up. There are no_T.O.’s or
Keyshawn’s in this group; they played
together, and that is what continued to drive
the team.

“We played for each other because I knew
the guy next to me was doing the same
thing,” said Moore, who had an impact sea-
son with two sacks, two interceptions and a
touchdown.

One Wildcat who played extremely well
was linebacker Arinsmier. His career tack-
ling mark right now sits at 262, just 12 tack-
les behind his mentor “the Godfather” Jim
Carney ’02.

“Being a captain, I tried to lead this team
week in and week out; if I can pass Carn’s
tackling mark, well that that’s just gravy,”
said Arinsmier.

This class will leave behind a few tradi-
tions that they have started as well. Fan
favorite Purcell and sure-handed Rice will
hand down the leadership positions of TWO

after Saturday. TWO, which stands for Team °

Wide Out, has lived up to the name as
Davidson has profited from going to the air
all season long. Rice has caught 15 passes
for 299 yards and four touchdowns, and
Purcell hauled in 13 balls for 123 yards and
one touchdown before a season-ending col-
lar bone surgery.

On the other side of the ball, co-captain
Childers and cornerback Anderson will also
be handing over the reins as Air Traffic
Controllers. Childers and Anderson have
combined for 11 pass break-ups and two
interceptions this season. Additionally, these
men have led the defense in their pursuit of
being the No. 1 defense in all of division 1-
AA in interceptions.

Williamson leads ’Cats
to victory at The Citadel

With the Southern Conference season
nearing its conclusion, the volleyball team
entered last weekend with
matches against two teams
at different ends of the
conference spectrum and
split matches with College
of Charleston and The
Citadel.

The Wildcats hoped to
improve their 8-6 confer-
ence record and build
momentum for the confer-
ence tournament’ with
away matches against the
Cougars and the Bulldogs,

the top- and _ bottom-
ranked teams in_ the
SoCon.

At Charleston on

Saturday, the Wildcats feli
behind early in all three
games, losing 3-0 against
the SoCon regular season

champions. After dropping The Wildcats are now 9-7 in the
SoCon going into the last week of

game one 30-16, Davidson
fell behind 10-4 to start
game two before rallying to narrow the mar-
gin to 15-12.

The Wildcats were unable to maintain
their momentum, however, dropping the sec-
ond game 30-19.

Game three was another close one as the
’Cats trailed only 16-15 at the midway point.
The Cougars pulled away in the end, though,
closing out the match with a 30-23 victory in
game three. Liz Williamson ’07 led the
Wildcats in kills for the. match with 12, while
Kate Pierucci ’08 registered a team-high 15
digs.

College of Charleston secured first place

conference play.

in the SoCon with the win.

After the loss on Saturday, Davidson
hoped to close out the weekend with a split
as the team faced The Citadel on Sunday.
The Citadel entered the match 0-16 in the
Southern Conference,
including a 3-0 loss to
Davidson earlier this
season.

The Wildcats won
each of the first two
games by a 30-21 score
before struggling to
close out game three. In
the second game,
Tierney Hodge ’09 gave
m the ’Cats a late advan-
§ tage by serving six con-
secutive points and seal-
ing the game for her
team. With Davidson
leading 19-15 in the
third game, the Bulldogs
went on an 11-1 run and
ultimately took the
game 30-25.

Needing only one
more game to close out
the match, the ’Cats
took control of game
four after struggling early. Tied 10-10, the
Wildcats pulled away with a 14-5 run, clos-
ing out the match with a 30-18 win.
Williamson again led the team in kills with
24, one shy of her career high, while also
registering 12 digs for a double-double.

The weekend split leaves the Wildcats at
13-17 on the season, 9-7 in the conference.
The team will finish up the regular season
with two home matches this weekend, a
Friday match at 7 p.m. against Furman and
Saturday’s Senior Day match against
Wofford, the home finale for captain and
lone senior Erin Balak ’06.

Arnold and Culter both
came to Davidson from
the state of Ohio, and they
have held down the
Davidson offensive line
for nearly fours years,
Culter, from powerhouse
St. X high school in
Cincinnati, and Arnold,
our school president, have
been thrust into starting
positions from very early
in their careers and will
shut the door on Saturday.
“We knew it was going to
be a battle each game, and
we tried to achieve war-
rior status every
Saturday,” said Culter.

Green and Sundheim
have been mixing it up in
the backfield ever since

they got here from
Mississippi and
California, respectively.

Green is a powerful run-
ner who loves to grind it
out, while Sundheim got [uaa S cents
most of his touches on ee
receptions and notched his
first career touchdown at
Austin Peay during his
first year at Davidson.
Both backs will be
missed.

If the seniors results at this summer’s com-

Ryan Arnold ’06.and Alex Arinsmier ’06 will compete in
their final game Saturday at Georgetown.

laughing on bus rides, off-season training,
and very, very long Commons meals,” said

bine don’t shock the scouts, the careers of
these 10 players will be over. “I doubt that
years from now I will recall the score of a
particular game, or a certain catch I made. I
am positive, however, that I'll always

careers and be proud. All 10 came from dif-
ferent high school programs and various lev-
els of success, but all will graduate as broth-
ers and as ’Cats.
