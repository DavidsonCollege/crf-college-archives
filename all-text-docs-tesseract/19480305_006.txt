What About Church Colleges?

As for what are called our
“Christian colleges,” the campus
situation there is often still worse.
For here, though biblical facts are
normally taught with a loving and
devout fidelity, they are usually

carefully segregated from all dark
and practical realities—at least so
far so their application to our
present social order is concerned.
The prophetic insights of Isaiah,
though held up as lovely and noble,
are rarely allowed to make con-
nection with the agonizing needs of
a modern India. The ethics of Paul
must have nothing to say to 4
Henry or a Caesar Petrillo
(or maybe they can to Petrillo!)
and certainly God's rebuke of
Peter’s anti-Gentile prejudice on
the housetop in Joppa must be al-
lowed to imply nothing whatever
about race prejudice in Mobile or
Atlanta. At these Christian schools
where deep moral as well as social
reasons ought to inspire a fearless
search for truth wherever the truth
may lie, and where once in a while
one might expect to hear in the
voice of @ teacher the accents of
an Amos or Rauschenbusch or
Wesley firing students to a passion
for social righteousness, one hears
too often only the snores of a cam-
pus deep in slumber. One gets the
impression that whatever social sins
have plagued the world are either
beyond our shores or else were
sately banished by 1900.

Does someone say this paints the
picture too black? It may for a
handful of schools that appear at
last to be seeing what Rip Van
Winkles they've been, but so far
as the total picture is concerned
two bits of evidence only etch the
lines more sharply.

Why Don’t They Care?

Back in the 1930's a British pro-
who had taught in both
English and American universities,
wrote for Harper’s magazine an
article titled, “Why Don't Your
Young Men Care-” The gist of it
was that British students by and
large were far ahead of their Ameri-
can cousins in both their political
awareness and their moral concern
for the welfare of the state. Where
at Oxford or Cambridge a speech
by a visiting statesman would often
pack the biggest hall in town, at
Cornell or Tulane a similar crowd
could be drawn only by a dance
or a basketball game; and where
the top graduates in Britain aspired
normally to a creer in the foreign
office or Downing Street, the best
ones in America often dreamed in-
stead of the “kiling’ they were
going to make in Sears Roebuck or
Standard Oil. And the secret of the
difference? It lay partly if not chief-
ly, the writer implied, in the at-

Ford

fessor,

| moSphere and teaching the students

found on the campus,

To come even closer home, take
a few of the official finding of our
Army and Navy. It was an open
secret during the war that the lack
of understanding among our serv-
ice-men and women as to what the
war meant politically and socially
was little short of appalling, Even
many college and university grad-
uates had only the haziest notion of
the basic meaning and value of de-
mocracy as opposed to the rival
doctrines arrayed against it, Before
that war was over, to be sure, a
great many of .these young people
had been given at least a preface
to the kind of awareness out of
which a robust intelligent faith in
democracy grows; but the sobering
thing about it was that it took an
“indoctrination program’? hastily
improvised by our military brass to
do even that.

Students Are the Victims

It all adds up anyway—the beams
in the darkness notwithstanding—
to a species of blight upon the na-
tion’s mind that ought to agitate
every serious member of our stu-
dent generation. For whoever else
‘may be involved, it is these stu-
dents in both their private and pub-
lic lives who are apt to be the vic-
tims-in-chief if conditions are left
as they are.

About one long-tabooed subject
anyway many students lately have
been stirred to action, They have
been demanding a better brand of
instruction about the biological and
psychological facts of life that make
for happier living in the family—
and not only demanding it, but in
many places, getting it. But what
more of them need to see is that,
important as it is, social realism
on that level is not enough. Another
¢rying need—in many ways the
most urgent of all—is for the
realistic preparation of youth for
intelligent cooperative livifig in the
larger family relationships of their
complex and changing world. For
while American educators are
rapidly getting over the notion that
“if two young people love each
other they don’t need to read book
about marriage and the family,” at
too many are still wedded to an.
equally sentimental view of human
relations on the broadest stage of
all. There it is still widely felt,
apparently, that if only a student's
heart leaps up when he beholds

Old Glory in the breeze he is by
that token entirely prepared for all
the duties of citizenship.

Both bits of sentimentality, of
course, need to be seen as cut from
the cloth. In fact, if we are to keep
intact a society in which decent,
well-ordered homes are possible,
our educational progress in small
realm must be quickly matched by
a like advance in the other. As a
growing number of schools are
seeing the need for a more practical
type of training to combat divorce
in the family, so too must they be
made to see the need for equally
practical education to combat simi-
lar divisive disasters in the state.
For much of the trouble in both
areas can be traced back to the
same kind of ignorance. Our col-
lege and university graduates,
though increasingly well-trained of
late in matters that make them
more polished and efficient as pri-
vate individuals, have been left all

too uninformed about facts and

values arid methods that

time that somebody,

far more fatal
