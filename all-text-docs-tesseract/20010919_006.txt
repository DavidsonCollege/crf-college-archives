Smith Gallery exhibits “Dissections”

By ERIN RAFFETY

Staff Writer

Perhaps in all the buzz of the art
opening at the Visual Arts Center here at
Davidson a few weeks ago,
it is understandable that —
many people missed stepping
inside the Edward M. Smith
Gallery, the room across
from the faculty show. Still,
the Smith Gallery, which
presents Susan Brenner’s
recent paintings on paper
through October 10th, 2001,
is worth visiting.

Brenner, who holds
a Bachelor of Fine Arts from
San Francisco Art Institute
and a Master of Fine Arts
from University of Southern
Carolina currently teaches at

The collection is a myriad.of cords and
coils, cages and curves, intricate, colorful,
and symbolic. At times Brenner’s work is
rope-like and rosy; the next, dotted and
spotted.
Overall this
exhibit
displays more
earthy tones:
pinks, reds,
and oranges,
suggesting the
warmth and
womb. Ms.
Brenner brings
as much
attention to the
background as
to the. fore-
ground, often
fusing the

UNC-Charlotte as an
Associate Professor of Art.
Ms. Brenner is the recipient
of numerous faculty research
grants at the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte and has
participated in many lectures and panel
discussions with distinguished artists and
galleries across the country.

Brenner’s current exhibit here at
Davidson is a collection of smaller paint-
ings, which like most of her art, express
and suggest human anatomy though “less
directly figurative” than her past work.

positive with
the negative.
“My handling
of the paint
purposely
ranges from loosely ‘realistic,’ to fairly
schematic or abstract, to references to
specific historical styles,” says Brenner.
“Both image and paint are intended to play
with perception and stimulate associations
with physical experience..”

Brenner succeeds in this effort by
using “areas of paint that refer to internal
organs” as well as cellular structures or

references to the circulatory
and nervous systems. A
two-by-four grid of small
paintings on the south wall
of the gallery contains
references to the embryo, the .
brain, ribs, pelvis, and
variations on these. The
three-by-four grid on the
opposite wall contains
suggestions of brain, vessels,
veins, and intestines. Still,
the body parts and images
are deeply idealized and
glorified. On the opposite
side of the door to the
gallery, on the north wall,
pink, purple, and blue ropes
crowd a dark heart-like
indication of body. Brenner
overall traverses the bound-
ary of inner and outer
structure, at the same time
deeply involving the psycho-
logical.

Perhaps the focal
point of the exhibit is the
large paintings arranged in a
two-by- three grid on the east wall of the
gallery. Brenner has repeated the image of
a coiled rope yet presented it differently
each time, in terms of coloring, and her
separation of the background and fore-
ground. Still, the coil, which she chose for
its “flexibility and fluidity,” is always

prominent. Beyond it, like in many of the
paintings, Brenner causes the background
to “disconnect” at some point, like photos
ill-aligned, spliced, separated. The effect is
startling, and the entire exhibit is well
worth a second walk over to the VAC.

Davidson Concert Series presents: The Alin Trio
9/21/01 - Love Auditorium 8:00 pm

“The picaanieanl success of the new CD on EMI
Classics, Ahn Plugged, is no surprise to the many
fans of the Ahn Trio. They launched their latest
CD with music composed by Kenji Bunch; Astor
Piazzolla, Leonard Bernstein, Eric Ewazen,
Michael Nyman, and David Bowie at Joe’s Pub in
New York City on two successive nights. A sold-
out crowd on both nights prompted a second

engagement in September. This season, the trio

adds South America to its list of concert tours.
When the Ahns are not performing in New York,
