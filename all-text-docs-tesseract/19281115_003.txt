Oxford Degrees Are
Difficult to Obtain

By W. Y. ELLIOTT
Assistant Professor of Government at
Harvard, Rhodes Scholar from Tenn.
to Balkiol College, Oxford; D. Phil.
Oxon., 1923.

Just after the war, when Oxford had
yielded to the pressure brought to hear
upon the Convocation to grant the grad-
uate degree of Doctor of Philosophy so
necessary to attract mature foreign stn-
dents, the D.Phil. (as it is stubborily
called), was something of an x in an
equation whose variables had still to be
established by precedents. From the !e-
ginning it was clear that the University
had no intention of awarding the degree
to industrious clerks for what is known
in. American
The research ha dto be done, but in ihe
presentation of the results and their inter-
pretation, the faculties of Oxford ini-
formly insisted upon some distinction of
style and thought. Naturally the mortal-
ity among the first candidates permitted
to come up for the degree was shocking.
The chagrin of many candidates entirely
worthy of Ph.D.s in the approved Amer-
ican tradition was only equalled by the
mortal terror that their fate inspired in
those who had not yet come up for the
examinations, which include a written gen-
eral examination, the scrutiny of the
thesis, and the public viva voce.

It became evident that many
students, chiefly Americans, were being
admitted to advanced standing and allowed
to read for the degree who did not pos-
sess the critical maturity to work almost
unaided upon ‘a major research problem.
Accustomed to the careful shepherding of
courses and seminars, the American stu-,
dents were quite lost, as a rule, when con-
fronted with the necessity of saving their

universities as “research.’

the very casual advice of a supervisor,
and by the bewildering wealth of lectures
and libraries in which they might browse
at will.

some pressure from the Society of Post-

derivee such help as falls to him from
the supervisor whom he desires. In any
that differs enormously with individuals
and even with faculties. Generally, if he
is a competent student, he can hope to get
the supercisor whom he desires. In any
case, if he be willing to work pretty much
alone for the nectssary minimum of six
or seven Oxford terms (the smaller num-
ber for high honors men who have done
the Oxford B.A.) he may enjoy an oppor-

tunity that no American university affords
for absorbing, unhindered, the cream of a
rich tradition of scholarship. Of coucse

been led by the hand too long.

The words
of a great president of one of our greatest
universities come to me, as he commented
on a doctor's thesis:
spired, uncritical, dull
of our Ph.D. degree.”
The blight of the Ph.D—there is such a
thing—has not descended upon the Ox-
ford degree as, yet.

For the very reason
that its administration is still flexible, that
its award is made dependent upon results,
not on formulae for fulfilling certain re-
quirements—an independent graduate stu-
dent may find it very heaven, For research

What, after all, do we expect of grad-
uate study? For those who hope merely
for a teaching degree, Oxford is not the

place. But for those who desire to study

{a problem under a master, and within

reach of a wealth of tools, Oxford offers
unique opportunities. The degree has not
yet been “organized” to uniformity of

hardships and to expose themselves ‘o

dom might be saved. We honor and re-
spect these brave men who are with us

tribute of respect and devotion to those of

Dr. McConnell then gave some intzr-
esting facts and figures upon the cost of
the World War. That at the end it was
costing ten million dollars an hour, three
times the total value of Davidson College,
plant and equipment. He stated that the
money loss was not the greatest, that the
cost in human lives was the greatest, thit
“sixty-five million physically fit men call-
ed into service, eight million were killed
in battle or died of disease, nine million
were so seriously maimed and crippled that
they are a liability to society,twenty-ong4
million more received wounds of great a
or less severity.”

Following an eulogy of Woodrow Wil-
son, the great War President, who once
attended Davidson, Dr. McConnell closed
with: “Paraphrasing the words of Lin-

coln, The world will little note nor long
remember what we say here, but it can
never forget what they did there. It

It is rather for us to

before us—that from these honored dead
we take increased devotion to that cause

this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom and that peace may be
brought to the hearts and homes of all
men.

“Who goes there, in the night,
Acrossthe storm-swept plain?

We are the ghosts of valiant war—
A million murdered men.

“Who goes there, in the dawn,
Across the sun-swept plain ?

to pack your own blanket for the week-end—

“I’d rather have a Chesterfield,” fortunately,

discernment and excellent discrimination.

And small wonder, considering all the re-

to justify the choice of that man who thus
