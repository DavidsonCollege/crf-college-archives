THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 3, 1933

Rev. McCloud Conducts
Service Sunday Evening
With Appealing Address

Columbia Theological Seminary Quar-
tet Render Several -Musical
Selections

Gripping his hearers with the force of a
powerful mental and spiritual influence, the
Rev. Murdock McCloud, a Davidson gradu-
ate himself, presented to his audience a vital
message of deep appeal at the evening
Y. M. C. A. vespers service on last Sunday,
April 30, Dr. McCloud is pastor of the Pres-
byterian Church in Pinehurst.

After the audience had filed in, Lanier
Pratt, the leader, called upon Bob McCallie
to offer prayer.» The Columbia Theological
Seminary Quartet favored the assembly with
a pair of old favorites, “Go, When the Morn-
ing Shineth,” and “Shall I Crucify My Sa-
vior?” '

“There are four things which hold us to-
gether—a common need, a common object,
common enemies to be overcome, and a com-
mon lacking,” explained Mr. McCloud. “In
encountering these, one of the hardest facts
that a youfig preacher must face is that the
world is actually a real place. He soon finds
corruption running rife; he discovers that
there are a great number of people who are
not living true Christian lives. He finds the
church being used merely to satisfy the so-
cial and intellectual impulses. This is no use
for the Nevertheless, many people
lcok upon the church as a sugar-coated pill
to cure our present-day ills.”

Mr. McCloud then quoted the
the Apostle Paul, “When I was a _ child, I
spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child. But now that I am
become a man, I have put’ away childish
things.” We are growing older mentally—
let us. grow essentially; let our concepts of
God expand with our growing years.

There is a longing to bring man to the
feet of Christ, for we are debtors to all
mankind. Paul recognized this fact. He

was ready to take the Gospel out at a tre-
mendous sacrifice, we may read of the suf-
fcrings for Christ. The acceptance of
apostleship was not a little change; but Paul
was ready to give his last drop of blood
for it.

Mr. McCloud said that
ruler who was offered the to follow
Jesus and in sorrowful mood
was not thinking of anything in the world
but the cost to him. He was probably saved,
for he had not disputed’ over obtaining a

ter than they. Jesus said, “If any man
would follow me, let him deny himself, take
tip his cross and follow me.” When Christ
says, “Deny thyself,” He means it. We do
not live long, and must take up our crosses,
blast out the old man who seeks to destroy
us and put.on the new.

“Business men, professional men; and the
man in the pulpit; every man, woman, and
child—all are seeking satisfaction. It takes
no little thing to give it to them.”

A number of students, who have come in

invited several representatives of this move-
ment to. come to Davidson and meet infor-
mally with’ groups of those interested, in
order that their principles might be more
fully explained.

the past twelve years been growing stead-

Hawknis, recently .elected varsity
leader, has stated that the outlook
for the junior cheer leaders during the com-
ing year looks promising.

Several men who have reported for the
tryouts have had previous experience, and
those»who~are out for the first time are
working industrially learning the Ata
tals of the yells.

George Barnes, Fritz Byerly, Rd Garret,
Henry Gregory, P. D. Guerrant, Kirk Han-
rahan, Charles McCall, Dave McClain, Getty
Monroe, Harry Morris, Paul Warren, and
Lee West are those who are trying out for
the positions of junior cheer leader.

These-men will work out at the remain-
ing baseball games of the season, and at the
pep meetings in the fall, They will also
lead cheers at the first football game in
September. This is done in order that the
student body may judge which two of the
men will make the best assistants for the
year.

The elections for the junior cheer leaders
will be held after the first football game

BROWN WINS FIRST PLACE
WITH FORCEFUL SPEECH

(Continued from page 1)
Statesville, and Mrs. C. T. Wanzer, Char-
lotte. :

Second place was won by Margaret
Mauney, Lenoir-Rhyne, whose subject was
“Peace Through International Education,”
while third place was taken by William E.
Braswell, who represented State College,
with the subject of “Peace Is Possible.”

Brown spoke in his usual forceful style,
stressing his points clearly. Hes declared in
his opening sentences that orations were
dangerous things, and that while speaking
on peace we feel secure, but if war were
declared tomorrow it would be orations that
would move us to take up arms. He stressed
the futility of war, and declared that the
next conflagration would see the collapse of
civilization, and, therefore, peace was nec-
essary.

During Miss Stephens’ talk she was con-
tinually interrupted by the presence of a
bat, which had flown into the auditorium
through an open window. She appealed to
the chairman that unless the bat were re-
moved it would be impossible for her to
continue. Several plans were suggested and
tried, but they were of no avail. She fin-
ished her speech with the animal still flut-
tering its blind way around the auditorium
and the stage. :

Some question of the eligibility of Brown
was brought up during the judging of the
speakers. It was brought out that a college
representative must be chosen two weeks
ahead of the scheduled contest. Brown was
chosen two nights before the speaking. It
was found that any information of this sort
was not received by the Forensic Council
until April 21. This matter is to be cleared
up by the state chairman,

A list of the speakers and their talks is
as follows: E. Leonidas Smith, Wake For-
est, “A New Internationalism”’; Miss Mar-
garet Mauney, Lenoir - Rhyne, ‘Peace
Through IJnternational Education”; Gordon
Brown, Davidson College, “The Unseen
War”; Miss Sara Stephens, Asheville U. and
T. C., “The Kiss of Death’; and William E.
Braswell, State College, “Peace Is Possible.”

Edward H. Paget, Wake Forest; A. B. ~
Hoskins, Miss Nora Padgétte, both of Ashe- |
ville U. and T. C., and J. Rice Quisenberry,
Wake Forest, accompanied their speakers
as faculty representatives.

While here the speakers and advisers were
guests of the Davidson Forensic Council.

Musical selections were rendered as part
of the program by William Hart, organist,
and Robert Orr, violinist, both of Davidson.

At the conclusion of the speaking a re-
ception was held in the faculty room ‘in
Chambers for the speakers, officials and
members of the faculty.

The truth is a beautiful thing, even when
it’s tangled and in doubtful taste—W. B.
