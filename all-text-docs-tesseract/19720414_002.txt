Bookstore Relocates

In Basement Of Belk

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

Next year the college book-
stove will be located in the base
ment of Belk Dormitcry in space
now occupied by the ROTC De-
partment.

Two classrooms and a storage
room will be converted into the
store at an approximate cost of
$2,000.

Vice ‘President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell said that ‘‘This is certainly
not a permanent solution. The
location of the bookstore in Belk
is only temporary and will 1¢-
main there no more than two or
three years.”

Cornell sees no feasible alter-
native to locating the bookstore
in temporary quarters for a few
years when its present home in
the union is demolished this

added. The cast includes five
women and seven men, all Dav-
idson students.

The production will be preset
ed April 20-22 in Hodsoo Iall sit

formance for Davidson students
will be on Wednes lav, April 19.
at 7:30 p.m. for $.50.

summer. “Though I would like
things settled,” he said, ‘‘this is
not the time to build a new book-
stove.” Locating it temporarily
is Belk basement ‘enables us
to keep our opticns open and
gives us time to plan for a per-
manent solution.”

The loca-ion in Belk was chos-
cn because the cost of convert-
ing that site was less than any
other. The basement of Richard-
son Dormitory was studied as a
possible location, however, locat-
ing the bookstore there would
involve knocking ou. rooms at a
loss of housing and an increase
in expense.

Another possibility was to
erect a temporary structure, but
Cornell indicated that he sees
this solution as impractical and
uneconomical.

He noted, ‘‘Temporary  build-
ings have a way of sticking
around. The wooden — building
across from the laundry was
built as ‘temporary’ in 1916.”

Two possible permanent loca-
tions are now under study by
committees appointed by the Fi-
nance and Development Office.
The first proposal is that the
bookstore be combined with a
new union in an arrangement
similar to the present one.

The second proposal involves
moving Jhe bookstore off cam-
pus to a location in downtown
Davidson. But in a move off

campus the bookstore would
lose the present tax benefits
which it draws from being class.
ed as a student service. The
store is presently owned by the
college, however, and if it were
to move off campus “‘there is a
good possibility,” said Cornell
“that it would become a fran.
chise operation,” though the col
lege would own the building in
which it would be housed.

Reaction to the bookstore be-
ing located in Belk was gener.
ally not enthusiastic. Though
Peter Nicholls, manager of the
bookstore, said he was not “par.
ticularly fond of the location in
Belk,” he also said he sees it as
“the only logical choice at this
time.” Nicholls indicated that
he would have preferred the
bookstore to be tioused in a
temporary structure somewhcre
on campus.

Student Body President Ralph
Peeples concurs with Nicholls’
sentiments. ‘‘It’s the best of the
possible options,” he said.

Student reaction to the Belk
site is at best indifferent. Many
felt that though it may be the
best of the temporary alterna-
tives, they would rather see the
bookstore located at a perma.
nent site.

“What is temporary in the
life of the college will be per
manent for the three years I'll
be here,” was the reacticn of
one freshman.

Senate Approves Security,
Budget, Coeducation Plans

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

With a barrage of legislative
activity, the Senate met Tues-
day and endorsed a new secur-
ity plan, approved next year’s
SGA budget, requested extended
gym hours, passed a resolution
supporting Head _ Basketball
Coach Terry Holland, and dis-
cussed beer sales on campus,
the new plan for course regis-
tration, and the status of the
coeducation issue.

The Campus Security Commit-
tee, chaired by Mitch Purvis,
presented and recommended the
‘‘Meetze Masten Plan” for im-
proved security, drawn up by
Director of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze. The commit-
tee presented its own additions,
which, along with Meetze’s plan,
were endorsed by the Senate
with only one dissenting vote.

The plan centers on the joint
hiring by the college and. town
of Davidson of two profession-
ally equipped and armed secur-
ity men. The men would serve
in shifts of 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. and
10 p.m. to 6 a.m., overlapping
in the most difficult hours from

-10 p.m. to 2 a.m.

According to the plan, the se-
curity men would be equipped
by the town with uniforms and
a patrol car. The car radio and
walkie-talkies would provide bet-
ter, more direct communica-
tion.

From 6 a.m. to 10 am, a

work-study student patrol with
Wwalkie-talkies would keep watch
over the campus. The college
would retain one watchman pa-
trol the remaming day-time
hours.

The plan provides that the two
professional men be hired with.
the approval of the Dean of Stu-
dents, the town police chief, and
the director of the Physical
Plant, who would have adminis-
trative control over such mat-
ters as schedules, and patrol
paths.

The committee’s additions to
Meetze’s plan included a recom-
mendation that the student work-
study patrol period be extended
to 6 p.m., and the security men
be restrained from entering the
dormitories except by specific
Student request or as directed
by civil authorities in case of
an emergency.

The committee also asked that
the “social patterns” of students
not be interrupted by the new
presence of these security men,
and that misdemeanors prohib-
ited by college rules be handled
by college officials.

Another recommendation ask-
ed that one of the security men
be black and that there would
always be at least one security
man on campus from 6 a.m. to
6 p.m,

The plan now goes to the Vice
President for Financial Affairs
C. David Cornell. Purvis said
that Meetze claimed that his
present budget would cover the

cost of the plan, but that the
anticipated cut-backs would pro
hibit it.

Next year’s SGA budget re-
guests were approved unani-
mously. Blain Butner presented
the proposed budget of $6,300,
up $300 from the present bud-
get.

The Senate is requesting $800
for general expenses (up $100),
$345 for conventions (up $45),
$100 for hospitality expenses
(same), $1500 for speakers
(down. $300), $25 for the Griev-
ance Committee (new), $300 for
Patterson Court Council (new),
$200 for the social system (new),
$1500 for psychological counsel-
ing (down $500), $530 for the
Chancellor’s fee, and $1,000 for
legal services for students (new).

The budget requests now go to
the Campus Tax Committee for
approval.

Blain Butner reported to the
Senate that he had found that
veither manpower nor financial
considerations were obstacles to
extending gym hours past 10
p.m. during the week. The Sen-
ate unanimously passed his res-
olution calling for longer gym
hours using work-study students.

After discussing the faculty
vote on coeducation, Student
Body President Ralph Peeples
announced that he would ap-
point an ad hoc Committee on
Coeducation to push for final ap-
proval and full implementation
of the plan, and to work on re-
cruitment for next year,
