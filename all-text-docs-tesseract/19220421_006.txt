WALTER CAMPBELL. |

It is with keen regret and sympathy
that Davidson men will learn of the
death of Walter L. Campbell, ex-’23, of
Norwood, N. C. He met an almost sud-
den death by accidentally falling from a
third story window in Washington, .D.
C., on April roth.

Walter, entering Davidson with the
class of ’23, soon became one of the most
popular and well liked members of his
class. His musical ability soon won him
a place on the glee club. He was also
a member of the Beta Theta Pi Frater-
nity

After spending a year at Davidson he
went to Wake Forest where he took a
law course, which led to his entry to
the North Carolina’bar in 1921. He prac-
ticed law in Statesville and in Albemarle
for several months and then went to
Washington, D. C., four months ago,
where heaccepted a position in the De-
partment of Internal Revenue as a pro-
hibition enforcement agent. ' |

It was while waiting for some friends
who had promised to help him locate an
apartment that he could occupy after
May 3d, when-he was to be married to
Miss Dorothy Powell, of Charlotte, that
his tragic death occurred. His death is
mysterious in that no one saw him fall,
It is supposed, however, that he had rais-
ed a window to cool off, and became
dizzy or fainted and fell headlong to the
pavement thirty feet below, dying a few
minutes later. The verdict of the coro-
ner’s jury was that he “was accidentally
killed.” ;

His father, Dr. J. I. Campbell and his
uncle, W. F. Long, accompanied his re-
mains to Rockingham, N. C., where he
was buried on April 13th.

His death came as a sudden shock to
his many friends both in college and
among alumni, Their deepest sympathies
go out to his father in the untimely
death of his only child.

Elon Game.

The Wildcat clan of hard-hitting
fence-busters wound up their North
Carolina trip by taking the measure of
Elon 9-8. The Davidson team collected
17 Safeties again, including two doubles
and two triples. Every man on the team
cxcept McMillan connected for at least
one hit.

Crawford, the slugging first-basenian,
was the individual star for the Wildcats.
Pat made five trips to the platter and
each time he came through with a safety,
his first being good for three sacks. Hé
drove in two runs, scored another: and
was caught at the plate on another oc-
casion. In the field he had’a perfect day,
handling 11 chances succéssfully.

The Davidson runs came in bunches.
A batting rally in the first scored three.
After one was gone Brice doubled to left
and scored on Crawford’s triple to cen-
ter. McLeod. rolled to Marlette and Pat
was caught at the plate. - Pritchett
doubled to left and Freetan’s single
scored two,

The Wildcats got started again in the
fifth, Boushee, M. Erwin, Brice,. and
Crawford, singled in order. McLeod
forced M. Erwis at third but Pritchett
took up the good work again and singled
te center; Freeman followed suit. Mc-
Millan walked and L. Erwin’s three-ply
swat sent a crowd over. Boushee finally
ended the inning by taking three health-
ies and missing.

In the meantime Elon had collected
eight runs off Boushee, the sixth lap
starting with Davidson in the lead 9 to
& Both pitchers then clamped down
and during the next four innings neither
side was able to score. Elon got two
men to second but they could get no
further. Davidson had men on all threc
cushions but couldn’t get them across
the rubber.

other Red and Black representatives.

Although defeated, the Wildcat cin-
der squad showed what it could do, and
will do, with adequate coaching. Almost
every man participating was partaking
in his first college track meet, which is
in itself a severe handicap. However.

throw of 129 feet 9 inches will certainly
be hard to. beat. ‘

Their pole vaulters and jumpers are
apt to prave dangerous also. Two of
their men recently tied with a 11 feet 3
inch mark on the’ pole vault. Five fect
six inches seems to be their best in the
high jump, but they are strong again
on the broad, with 20 feet to their credit.
In the dashes they have not shown up
so well. They seem to get best results
in the distance affairs, with first place in
the two-mile, Saturday. All in all, it
scems their weakest point is the dashes.

There is no denial that they are going
to make it hot for Davidson in a good
many events.
