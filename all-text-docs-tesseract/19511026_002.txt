Is Executive Committee Policy
On Dances A Well Founded One?

For years far below the prestige on this campus that similar
organizations enjoy at colleges and universities throughout the
land, Davidson’s D Club was blocked again last week in an
attempt to lift itself out of oblivion.

Appedring before the executive committee with a request to
hold a dance in Charlotte November 10, following the N. C.
State football game. D. Club President Ham Wade was given
a “No” on the grounds that it was a policy of the College to
have all dances on campus now. Such a policy, it seems, has been
in effect since the completion of Johnston Gymnasium, and is,
obviously, for facility of faculty control of them.

Wade's appeal for a Charlotte dance was two-fold: 1)
The student body and dates will be in Charlotte anyway for
the game, and 2) a change of ballroom would relieve the mono-
tony of the gym for all big social functions. The faculty's con-
tention, backing up its policy, was that the ‘wrong crowd”
might make itself present in the form of rowdy outsiders. To
call it a shovel—-there would be drinking.

The Davidsonian is all for the D Club’s attempts to pull
itself’ up by its boot straps, and sees the Charlotte dance as a
good social change and a feather in these monogrammers’ caps
If this group of boys—those whom we pride for the sports-
manship. character, and clean-living on athletic teams—cannot
handle a private function in Charlotte, who can? Even the sub-
deb set at Central High can have its private affair and control
those present by invitation. Faculty members, of course, would
be welcomed. as guests and chaperones.

To the best of our recollections, the Scabbard and Blade
held an off-campus dance two years ago, Johnston Gym‘ not
withstanding. What about the D Club's deal? It seems the
student body is due an explanation of policy by the executive
committee.

Administration Health Action
Will Help, Not Hinder, Frats

An administration step toward corraling the fraternities
back to the dining halls for meals was the prevailing attitude
with which the news of the College's sanitation requirements
was received this week along fraternity row.

The control-shy Greeks were barking up exactly the wrong
tree, this time, however.

They read into the administration’s requirements of 1)
separate milk containers, 2) passable garbage disposal, 3) health
certificates for employees, and 4) certain specifications for wash-
ing glasses apart from the dishes, a motive to close down on
the various boarding houses and force them back to Chambers.

While the College was doing so for its own reason (i.e., to
save the College a whale of a black eye, for instance, in event
of a very possible epidemic), it was merely staying a step ahead
of the health authorities by making certain that Davidson's
frat boarding houses indeed would be able to pass and not be
closed down when the health department begins to check.

State health authorities have been trying for years to reach
boarding houses as they now do restaurants and cafeterias, but
pressure groups have kept such a legislation from passing. The
trend is more and more toward such a ruling, however, and a
foresighted Davidson College administration is making certain
its house is in order when the day comes. Many houses, under
the corresponding requirements for restaurants and cafes, would
be forced to close down now, should the law be passed applying
to boarding houses.

Far from a throat cutting, the ruling is a helping hand.
Could be that some quarters are too blind to recognize one
when it's extended.

Interfaith Talks Stirring
Stagnant Pools of Thought

The series of Thursday chapel speakers telling of the be-
liefs of a non-Protestant or non-Christian people should have
proved to this student body to be of great faith stimulation.

After Father Graves opened the Y-sponsored series three
weeks ago on Catholicism there was much talk created by his
positive manner, his ability to speak at length in answer to any
question concerning his faith, whether or not his quizzers were
in agreeance with what he said, to a man they admired him for
his stand on what he believes. It made many wonder if they
could speak for Protestantism with the same confident authority
Father Graves used for Catholicism.

Rabbi Herschfield, whose talk last week was one of the
most well-received in chapel in some time, provoked further
interest in what the other man believes with his plea for better
understanding and tolerance among faiths. And yesterday, Dr.
Sandy Marks told of how Christianity is received by those who
have never known it before. These talks, at a school where
Christianity is all but taken for granted, have stirred some
stagnant pools of thought.

It will either elate the top
100,00 thinking men in this
country. or be a miserable flop.
Frankly, we don't know which.

1951.

Tt was not until long after I
broke the Pablum habit that I real-
ized’ Alice in Wonderland was a
satire. And I had fidgeted my way
through « good many Saturday
cowboy matinees before some cruel
adult told me that Gulliver was
really not a giant, and that he
really didn’t travel, and that I was
a naive little dolt if I thought he
did. Consequently, I have since
called everything a satire and then
gone back to see if it really was
sort of like shooting first and asking
questions second.

Such was the case with a recent
advertisement that appeared in

[can't find any evidence to the
contrary, I .shall treat it as an
honest advertising effort, After the

Vassar Hopefully
Ushers In- Drive

To Boost Respect

Poughkeepsie, N. ¥. — Vassar
College is trying to break down
the following popular stereotypes in
its contacts with people outside the
college: that Vassar is for snob-
bish, rich girls; that Vassar is radi-
cal; that Vassar students are all
“greasy grinds,” according to Mrs.
Anthony Michaels, head of the Of-
fice of Public Relations.

To combat these popular miscon-
ceptions, her office stresses in its
press releases educationally excit-
ing campus activities. That Vassar
offers a liberal arts education in a
simple residential community is the
aspect of the campus scene that
the college wants to emphasize to
the general public.

The office plays up evidences of
academic freedom and pursuit of
facts, and tries to show how Vassar
students have fun on weekends and
in extracurricular activities, Public
relations releases emphasize that
most students become  happpily
married alumna, active in their
home communities.

Vassar girls, Mrs, Michaels said,
are responsible for their statements
as representatives of the college,
when they are talking to reporters
or being specifically interviewed.
Even Miss Sarah Gibson Blanding,
president, consults the office be-
fore making ~ public statements
about the school, she added.

What observer, with perception,

Effective, dynamic journalism, per-

The philosophical potentialities of
a pochoir Stutz Bearcat are beyond

Of course it will be. What thinking

Freudian Frustrations, Tensions
Alleviated By Co-Education

Peculiar to most Free Enterprise
educational institutions for men in

|Our American society is an almost

rabid pre-occupation with that
subject which is much whispered
about but seldom discussed openly
among the pious Presbyterian pil-
lars of Neo-Classic education—Sex.
We talk about it in our bull ses-
sions; we have private forums con-
cerning it, we read it into almost
everything anybody within our
midst writes or says; we look for
it in every conceivable aspect of
our curriculum, in literature, art,
history, and even economics; we
hang up pictures over-emphasizing
it. and even in our better moments
we are always on the lookout for
some mention, description, or ref-
erence to it. The mere sight of a
skirt on the campus makes eyes
bulge and mouths water, and at
the mention of the presence of a
girls’ school or a dance weekend
sends us, individually and collec-
tively into a mild form of hysteria.
In short, we're frustrated, thwarted
and immature as far as it if con-
cerned, and its high time some-
thing was done about our
Psychoses according to Freud.
The answer to all of these prob-
lems is simply this. Let’s make.
Davidson co-ed. Not only would
this tend to help us individually,
but it would also solve many of

The first effect of the co-educa-
tionalizing of Davidson would
be in the improvement of
manners. Our eating habits, our
dress, our personal appearance, and
our language would become over-
night just about what Mother spent
two futile decades trying to pro-
duce.

Its second effect would be upon
the morals of the Davidson stu-
dent. I venture to say that the
standard of our school as a whole
would tend upwards instead of
downwards. First, because girls of
social, educational and economic
classes would be readily available,
and secondly, we'd see what we'd
been missing all these years.

The third effect of a co-ed Da-
vidson would be the maturation of
the male student's mental attitude
toward sex. While here we grow up
mentally, and physically, and spirit-
ually, but if we had about 500

‘girls around, and could take the

fact of the opposite sex’s existence
for granted without having to look
so hard for some examples, we
would change our attitade to one
accepting and continuons enjoy-
ment, and not feel like we have
to cram the affections of a life-
time into two or three hours of
heavy necking. It would be a lot
easier on our dates, and a lot
easier on our own nerves and

the ills that the student body as a physical well-being for the weeks

whole has become heir to.

Psychology Te
Finds Education

As college students progress in
scholastic standing, they apparent-
ly reverse their attitudes toward
religion, as indicated by a survey
conducted by Milton D. Havron
of the University of Maryland's
psychology department.

The religious aspect of the study
was an incidental finding, as its
main purpose was to determine the
relationhip between a person's atti-
tudes and his verbal habits.
Though the attitude toward religion
was chosen, any attitude would
have Served the purpose.

While the results indicate a trend
away from religion as the student
advances, it may also be indicative
of merely a trend away from for-
mal religious expression, Havron
speculates.

Participating in the survey were
approximately 600 students, repre-
senting all class standings, inclad-
ing those doing graduate work. For
the purposes of the study, the stur
dents were classifiel as having
either predominantly “religious” or
“political-economic” attitudes.

The “religious” person is char-
acterized as being acquainted with
biblical rules of conduct, is a
church-goer, believes in personal
salvation, ethical values, and in a
final day of judgment.

The “politicalbeconomic” per-
son, on the other hand, thinks
more objectively, keeps abreast of
politics and economic trends, re-
gards Sunday as a day of rest,
believes that material welfare is
primary to ethical values, and likes
pleasure and fuxurious living.

Discovering America Cost Columbus $36,000;
Today He Couldn’t Leave New York Harbor

NEW YORK — Ii cost about
$36,000 for Columbus to discover
America. His payroll for 90 men
aboard The Santa Maria, Nina and
Pinta ran to 250,000 maravedis, or
some $3,500 a month.

Today, he wouldn't get out of
a U, S. harbor for that if he picked
up a crew here and tried to sail to
Spain. The payroll tab would
amount to as much every couple of
days, all things considered, as the
monthly did them. ‘

Columbus himself didn't havé to
foot much of the bill, but today
the Spanish cops might not be
willing to put up that kind of
dough. Oh, you didn’t know about
the cops? Well, wise up. Don't
believe that malarkey about Isa-
bella pawning her jewels, She of-
fered to, but didn’t.

. Actually, most of the money for
the first voyage in 1492 was bor-
rowed from the endowment of a
police force called the Santa Her-
mandad. True, the crown later re-
paid it, but the cops ran the risk.
Columbus, himself, invested 250,-

000 maravedis, which he probably
borrowed.

When you stop to think about
it—and this is a good time to
think about it since Columbus was
born just 500 ycars ago between
August 25 and October 31, 1951—
America was discovered by mis-
take and named by fraud.

Any school boy can tell you that
Columbus was looking for a shorter
Westward route to Asia. He was
not trying to prove that the world
was round. That wasn’t the big
argument. Most of the experts at
the time thought the world was
round,

Columbus was trying (o prove
that only a narrow ocean sepa-
rated Europe from Japan and the
gold and spices that old Marco
Polo had talked about. Old Chris
thought the distance was about
3,000 miles. He was wrong about
8,000 miles. If old Isabelle had
known it was that far, she might
have made old Chris stay home.

You don’t believe it? Look it
up in the Pulitzer prize book, “Ad-

miral of the Ocean Sea” by Samuel
E, Morison.

America was named after
Amerigo Vespucci, who came over
here, went back and wrote a re-
port which he pre-dated by two
years. He said he sighted the main-
land in 1497, Actually he didn’t see
it until 1499—about S00 years after
the Norsemen, two years after John
Cabot and one year after Colum-
bus.

Here are some more things you
probably didn’t learn in school:

For centuries, people have been
arguing whether Columbus was
Italian, Castilian, Catalan, Corsi-
can, Majorcan, Portuguese, French,
German, English, Greek, or Ar-
menian, But there is no doubt, says
Morison, he was an Italian, born
in Genoa. Except now and then,
he operated like a” Philadelphia
lawyer.

The queen had promised a re-
ward of 10,000 maravedis (about
$140) to the first man who sighted
land on the first voyage. At 10

gt [RICK ROPER:

The tast good effect of the in-
tegration of the feminine element
into our college life would be
along matrimonial lines. With a
good number of women in our
midst, and though we might never
learn how to handle them in times
of tantrums, comfort them when
they need it, listen to them when
they have something constructive
to say, and if you find your dream
girl here, you'll have ample time
to find out if you can live together
under normal everyday operating
conditions—and not have to lose
your judgments on a series of Sat-
urday nights. Then, too, when you
graduate, you'll be able to woo
the boss’ daughter as well as run
his business, thus assuring yourself
of achieving your ambition as a
$10,000 a year junior executive.

Gentlemen, our situation
serious! Let us take our problem
openly and present it in words of
wisdom and integrity to the ad-
ministration and the trustees, and
demand that in order for Davidson
to continue to produce the gentle-
men of high caliber who get letters
each year from the alumni officers
informing them as to how well off
they are, that she must begin to
produce a new phenomena, the Da-
vidson Lady, and the sooner she
gets started, the better.

Proposal To Recognize
Weakens Religion| Vatican May Go Hard
With Truman in ’52

Mr. Harry S. Truman, who writes
letters, calls nasty names, and is
President of the United States, has
done it again.

A past master at the art of an-
tagonizing people, the man from
Missouri made all his previous ac-
complishments look small in com-
parison with the furore his recent
naming of an ambassador to the
Vatican has caused. In the past, he
has practiced his hobby on such
minor figures as music critics and
newspaper columnists, but this
time he has succeeded in arousing
the ire of apparently the majority
of American Protestants, which is
quite a jump indeed,

In naming Gen, Mark Clark to
the Vatican post, Mr. Truman got
the disapproval of such high
Protestant leaders as:

GLENN L, ARCHER, execu-
tive secretary of Protestants
and other Americans for Sepa-
ration of Church and State,
who will ask the Senate not to
confirm the appointment, “The
action amounts to en effort to
revolutionize the American
form of government by abro-
gating its most fundamental
principle—the separation of
church and state,”

Unwise Proposal

BISHOP HENRY KNOX
SHERRILL, president of the Na-
tional Council of Churches of
Christ in the U.S.A. (representing
32 million American Protestants).
“I hope and belleve that this un-
wise proposal will be opposed by
the great. majority of fair-minded
Americans of every religious con-
viction and will be either withdrawn
or defeated in the Senate.”

DR. CARL McINTYRE, presi-
dent of the International Council
of American Chgistian Churches
(representing 1,500,000 Protestants
in the U. S,), “Rome is selling her
aid in fighting Communism for a
price instead of frecly giving what
she has to the cause of the West.
Truman’s purchase should be re-
turned.”

PROF. HENRY P. VAN
DUSEN, president, Union Theo-
logical Seminary: “I wish to add
my personal voice to the storm of
protest from loyal Americans who
are justly outraged, both by the
nomination of an American am-
bassador to the Vatican and by the
time of its announcement.”

Status of Vatican

Tite issue seems to have boiled
down to this: Our Constitution pro-
vides for separation of church and
state. The Vatican is recognized
as a church, and it is technically
impossihle for it to be both a
church and a state. If this is true,

the nomination of Clark as an am-
bassador violates the Constitution.
If the Vatican is a state, on the
other hand, rather than a church,
a lot of Catholics have had the
wrong idea for a long time. And,
technically, if the Vatican is a
state, it must assume the respon-
sibilities of, a state and register its
leaders as foreign agents,

But the issue within the issue
is Mr. Truman, who will only
be hurting himself if he in-
sists on the appointment being
approved by Congress, If any~
one knows that election time
is near, it is Our Hero of 1946,
and said politician must be
aware that the Protestants of
the U. 6, can make or break
him next fall,

Why did he do it, then?

A logical if improbable answer
to this question is the one con-
jectured in a Greensboro Daily
News story last Tuesday, In a
special story from Washington, the
Daily News’ Capital correspondent
said the appointment of Gen, Clark
“has been interpreted here as a
definite indication Truman does pot
intend to run.”

Solon Explains Move

A North Carolina legislator un-
identified in the Daily News story
made these points:

“President Truman made the ap-
pointment knowing the repercus-
sions it would bring, He could have
sent someone to the Vatican in
a lesser post, or do as President
Roosevelt did—name a personal
envoy,

“But he named an ambassador
to the Roman Catholic state.”

Judging from this report, it
would appear that the regime of
H. S. T. may end sooner than ex-
pected, But don’t count the man
from Independence out of the 1952
race yet, Another whistle-stop cam-
paign with a few plain, heart-warm-
ing speeches and Mr, H. S. (For-
get It) Truman will have a chance
to antagonize people for another
four years,

SOUTH RISES AGAIN AT
FURMAN WHERE FROSH
REVERE BARS AND STRIPES

Upperclassmen at Furman have
added a new (or old) twist to haz-
ing. Obviously, the trend toward
flying the old Confederate banner
from dersey to Georgia provoked it.

A Confederate flag will be raised

on campus each morning hy speci- |

fied freshmen. Rats passing the
flag will remove their caps at a
distance of five paces from the
flag and “maintain this state of
reverence” for five paces beyond
the flag. :
