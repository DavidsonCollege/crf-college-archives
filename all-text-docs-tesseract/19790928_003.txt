By TRACY THOMPSON
Staff Writer

While most students are well
aware of the new faces that

reside in Belk, Richardson, and

Sentelle, few are familiar with
the new face in the Admissions
Office— John Griffin. Griffin
came to Davidson August 1 to
take over the post of Director of
Admissions.

Griffin did his undergraduate —

studies at Dickinson College in
Pennsylvania. His graduate de-
gree is from Harvard Divinity
School where he did extensive
research on death and dying.
He worked as a chaplain at a

_ girl's school in Massachusetts,

then went on to earn his
doctorate in higher. education
administration at Syracuse U-
niversitv. N.Y.

Most recently, Mr. ‘Griffin
has worked on the federally
funded project CHOICE at the
‘University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, where he was on the
graduate faculty. This three
‘year study oversaw the admi-
sions procedures of twenty ins-
titutes of higher education,
‘ranging from Berkley to small
community colleges.

Why did Griffin give up his
prestigious position at the Uni-
versity of Michigan? He ex-

plained that he ‘‘wasn‘t able to
work with students, which is
very important to me.” Griffin
sees Davidson‘s admissions
program as “healthy” and one
that attracts a ‘highly qualified
pool of students.” He is looking
forward to continuing the pro-
grams already in progress as
well as expanding the role of
students and alumni in talking
with prospective students.
When he takes time to relax
from his role of advisor/educa-
tor, Mr. Griffin enjoys several
hobbies. He and his wife Nancy,
a librarian currently working on
compiling a bibliography under
an Albert Schweitzer Fellow-
ship, make quilts and collect
antique furniture which they

“use to furnish a restored N.Y.

farmhouse built in 1812.They
also enjoy family sports such as
swimming and bicycling with
their two sons, ages 5 years and
3 months. To them Davidson is
“like coming home...it is warm
and gracious and we look for-
ward to developing the close
relationships that are inevitable
here.”

“I have always liked. David-
son and I plan on being here for
awhile,” said Barry Cheatham,
the new Director of Dining
Services. Mr. Cheatham is ori-
ginally from Virginia, and has
been in North Carolina since his

school days at Elon College. He ~

has always been in the college
food -services business. Before
coming to Davidson as director,
he opened up new food service
accounts in other colleges. Ptior
to that he was’ employed at
UNCG for 1% years.

However, it was his employ-
ment prior to the two mentioned
which probably made him
cheose Davidson. He was the
Assistant Director of David-
son‘s Dining Services under
then director Mr. Ron Scott for
seven years before he left in the
spring of 1974. He returned here
on June 1 of this year. _

Mr. Cheatham hopes that

when he has, completed his’

career at Davidson, that he can
go into district and_regional
management in food services.

“T really love it here,” said
Bill Bolding, new Director of
Housing. ‘“‘From a professional
point of view, Davidson has the
most ideal working conditions.”

Bolding graduated from the
University of Oklahoma with a
B.A. degree in Political Science
and History; later received his
Masters in Urban Planning,
and began working with com-
munity housing and planning.

“T got tired of city planning
and wanted something more
immediate,” said Bolding , “so
I picked up a Masters degree in
Student Counseling at Stet-

regular basis with a student
