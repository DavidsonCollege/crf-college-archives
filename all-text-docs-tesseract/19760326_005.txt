nothing that this group of
people could do.

Jackson mentioned that he
had only one offer for support
of the National and that it had
come from a member of the
Board of Visitors who did not

know that the National was
going to end.

Like Spencer, Jackson was
unable to offer any solutions
to the problem of saving the
National. In fact, Jackson
questioned whether a problem
really exists. He suggested
that the small response from

Small grease fire
smokes out Delts

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

A small fire occured last
Friday whan a pot of grease
blazed up at the Phi Delta
Theta house on Patterson
Court.

According to house member
Jeff Neikirk, the fire started
when a large pot of cooking oil
was accidentally left on
‘“‘high.’’ At first the grease
just smoked, but it went un-
noticed for some time as the
smoke remained only in the

kitchen.
When the smoke was de-

_tected, Neikirk and others

made their way into the
kitchen where they were
driven out because of the thick
smoke. Neikirk wrapped his
face, grabbed the pot with a
wet cloth and started outside,
at ‘which point the grease
burst into flames.

Neikirk managed to get the
pot outside where a fireman‘

met him and extinguished the
blaze.

“TIT want to commend the
Davidson Fire Department,’’
said Neikirk. ‘‘After Jay
(Kopel) called them, they were
here in under five minutes.’

No damage was reported in
the house.

those who know that the
National is doomed might be
indicative that the show will
not really be missed.

‘It seems as though a new
fieldhouse is a larger priority
than a new art facility is. And
who's to say that it shouldn’t
be?’’ said Jackson.

‘Forty-niners’ grab
Charlotte publicity

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has, as
they say, captured the hearts, imaginations, and just
possibly the pocketbooks of Charlotte. The largest city in
the Carolinas has long been a stronghold of Davidson
College fans but evidence says that is no longer true.In
the Charlotte Observer Monday was a souvenir pullout
section dealing with the success of the UNCC basketball
team in the National Invitational Tournament. UNCC
finished second.

This section was heavily advertised. One ad indicated
what might be a widespread feeling in Charlotte. ‘‘UNCC
you're on the ball...you’ve scored with us! The 49ers are
first in the hearts of Charlotteans and we salute you for
your accomplishment.’’ A feature box in the section offered
instructions on ‘‘How To Donate To UNCC.”

WBT-TV, a large Charlotte television station,presented a
special about UNCC during prime time Tuesday, pre-
empting a regular network show. Needless to say Davidson
College recieved no mention. Larry Tarleton, Executive
Sports Editor of the Charlotte Observer and the person
responsible for the Observer Souvenir: section suggested
that Charlotte fans have indeed switched support from
Davidson to UNCC. ;

“The big thing is that UNCC is a winner right now and
Davidson is not. The Charlotte audience has no loyalties for
a losing team.’’ said Tarleton. ‘‘Ten years ago when
Davidson was winning, Charlotte was with Davidson.
Right now UNCC is the town favorite because they are
winners. People are not going out to see a 5-21 team,” he
said.

Tarleton admitted that he was a false authority on the
subject of Charlotte allegiance but added that neither the
49ers or the Wildcats could fill the coliseum during the past
basketball season. He believes this situation has changed.
“T expect if UNCC played there now they would sell the
place out.”’ he said.
