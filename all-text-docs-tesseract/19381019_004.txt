CAT-TALES

By TONI CASALI

Davidson's oldest rivals—the University of North Carolina Tar
Heels—will make their;appearance on the campus next Saturday,
lations between these two schools started way back in 1896 when the

Davidson will not have much of a chance to beat the boys from
Chapel Hill Saturday but it will be the best game that the stu-
dents will be able to see on Richardson field this year with the
possible exception of the Homecoming game with V.M.I. Davidson’s
offense has worked something like this in the five games to date.
The 'Cats have carried the ball 186 times and gained 850 yards while
losing 79. This gives them an average of better than four yards

for a gain of 361 yards. However, the dark side of the passing attack
is the fact that 12 of these tosses were pulled out of the air bywop-
posing forces. Anyway 12 yards on each completed pass is not a
bad showing—not when one out of every two is completed. The
kicking situation looks thus: Davis and Steed have booted the ball
32 times for a total of 1,164 yards from scrimmage which gives them
an average of 36 on each kick. The Wildcats have been penalized
only 14 times for a total loss of 130 yards. On the other hand, the
’Cats have been fortunate to have 21 penalties called against opposing
teams for losses of 205 yards.
