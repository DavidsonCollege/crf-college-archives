ODYSSEY PROGRAM oe BY
MORE VIOLENT ILIAD PROGRAM

Incoming freshmen will no
longer have the chance to meet
their future classmates on service
or backcountry trips, according to
new Davidson Outdoors director
Bob Agammemnon. Instead, all
freshmen will par-
ticipate in a summer
long seige of Troy,
NC, a small coal
community near
Reidsville.

“We got together
and figured, hell,
what’s the point of
having an Odyssey
without first having
an Thiad?”
Agammemnon said.

Whereas the old
freshman _ orienta-
tion program
focussed on service,
the new Iliad pro-
gram will focus on
disservice.
Students will spend three months
wreaking absolute havoc on a low
income community that, ironically
enough, incoming freshmen class-
es of the past have spent their sum-
mers revitalizing.

Senior Davidson Outdoors leader
Even Bergman ‘07 isn't really
concerned about getting to know
his freshmen.

“The old orientation program
was good for fostering friendships,
but I think the Iliad program will
forge them,” Senior Davidson
Outdoors leader Even Bergman ’07

said. “When you see a future class-

mate take a
flaming
arrow to the
cheast, you
really value
your spot at
Davidson

that much
more.”
Whereas
the old
Odyssey pro-
gram = was

, supposed to
| provide a
“unique,
challenging,
fun transition
to Davidson
life,” the new
Iliad program has been designed
“to instill freshmen with the fear of
the gods,” according to
Agammemnon.
Students’ will spend three months
building a giant wooden wildcat,

iPOD EARBUDS NOT ACTUALLY
HOOKED UP TO ANYTHING

In an embarrassing turn of
events Monday night, Marty
Hobstein ’09, went from a being a
“golden god to noob status” in a
matter of only seconds.

Noticing a group of female
friends gathered outside the Union
Café, Hobstein bobbed his head
and pretended to be “jamming out”
to music on the apparent iPod in
his right pants pocket. His head
pumps were frequent but noncha-
lant in an attempt to appear laid
back while simultaneously having
the determination and focus of
Eminem in “8-mile.”

Reports from onlookers indicat-
ed that his walk-up was fairly offi-
cial-looking, and it appeared that
he was listening to some old-
school rap with a slow moving bass
line.

“I was imagining some beats
from Public Enemy with a vocal
touch of Outkast pumping through
my veins at that moment. But the
truth is that excessive testosterone
and a fair amount of pixie-stick
sugar were the only things flowing
through me,” Hobstein admitted.

When Hobstein took his hand
out of his pocket to arbitrarily
wave it side to side in a rapper-
esque manner, the earbud plug that
wasn’t hooked up to an Ipod fell
out, instantly exposing him as a

fraud.
Freshman observer Erika
Stevens commented, “He looked

like a complete loser. I mean, who
doesn’t have a working iPod to go
with their cute white. earbuds? I’m
never going to talk to him at the
Court.”

When questioned about his deci-
sion to fake the possession of an
iPod, Hobstein remarked on long-
ing for the “in-look” other students
had with their white earbuds.

According to a new study by the
Sociology Department, Hobstein is
not alone in his quest to fit in
through this new fashionably
accepted technique.

Recent surveys indicate that
eight out of 10 wearers of the pop-
ular white iPod earbuds actually
have little to no interest in music at
all.

Sociologist Dr. Ruth Evans
offered her opinion on the situa-
tion. “It’s just like those
Tamagotchi’s or Giga pets that
were a fad back in the day. In the
moment, if you’re insecure it
makes perfect sense to talk to and
feed an electronic pet. But the
reality is this only reflects one’s

lack of purpose and constant self-.

doubt. So why wouldn’t you put
things into your ears so people will
think that you’re cool?”

rappelling from that wildcat, and
pouring scalding pots of tar onto
innocent townspeople from high
ramparts.

“Students will spend
three months build-
ing a giant wooden
wildcat, repelling
from that wildcat,
and pouring scalding
pots of tar from high
ramparts on innocent
townspeople.”

When confronted about the dubi-
ous morality of marauding an
impoverished hamlet,
Agammemnon replied, “The gods
have been slighted, and only
through great sacrifice can we
atone for that slight.”

Agamemmnon has not ruled out
the possibility of reinstituting the
Odyssey program with a few
changes several years in the future.

“For a more realistic experience,

we’ll obviously have to fight this
‘war before we can go on an
Odyssey back home to our wives
and families. Then hopefully we
can slaughter the bastards who
have taken our wives and homes.
while we’ve been gone.”

“We got together
and figured, hell,
what’s the point of
having an Odyssey
without first having
an Thad?”

Students will besiege the derelict
Troy, NC as part of Agammenon’s
new, innovative Iliad orientation

program.

UNION PIANO
THREAT ISSUED

In a whimsical pass by the Union
piano yesterday, the following
posting was discovered...

Dear Union Pianist,

If you are under the age of seven,
please disregard the following
message. Children under the age of
seven tend to be cute, and, at the
risk of offending the three in the
world who aren't we'd like to
exempt you all from the obnoxious
reality of taking responsibility for
your inherently worthless contribu-
tion to human society. It's not your
fault; you’re seven. Your lack of
experience provides you with the
God given right to create utterly
insignificant works of art over
which adults are required to ohh
and ahh. You trace your hand at
Thanksgiving and Daddy has to
give you a high five in front of
Mommy if he plans on getting laid
within the next millennium. I mean,
we kind of have to pretend, don't
we? No self-respecting parent
would ever greet his or her bushy-
eyed six year old son's return from
art class with the comment “are
you serious, Timmy? You call that a
macaroni necklace? Kill your-
self...comma die.”

But in all sincerity, Timmy,
through a most unfortunate turn of
events, you're not seven. The sad

truth is that you’ve reached the
illustrious age of 20, and yet given
the heart-warming, five dollar bill
taping Davidson society in which
you’ve been raised, you still expect
everyone to laud your appalling
piano work as “inspirational.”
This is the part at which a regular
self-indulgent student journalist
who just received the word
‘plethora” in his dictionary dot
com word of the day email would
write, “I'm talking, of course, about
those absurdly obnoxious students
who insist on playing the union
piano at all hours of the day.”
However, seeing as how I'm a real
human, I'm gonna talk straight to
you, Timmy. I believe I speak from
the heart when I say, shut the hell
up. You are not good at the piano,
and nobody likes you. Wow, you
know “Heart and Soul?” That's
awesome! So does every other
limb-possessing two-year-old. So
here's an idea. Next time you want
to give us all your picture-perfect
rendering of “Mary had a Little
Lamb,” use the time you would
have spent practicing to complete
your request to transfer applica-
tion.

In the meantime go do a sudoku
or something...you've earned it,
Sport.
