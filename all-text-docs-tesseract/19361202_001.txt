Story of David and Bathsheba Used as Background
For Discussion ’

“Confession and Forgiveness” was the theme of the sermon
by Rev. Dr. J. M. Walker at the vesper service Sunday evening,
November 28. The minister used the story of David and Bath- | Jelly Leftwich Plays For Lon
sheba as background for his Hhaaacs 4 8

The text was HI Samuel 12::13:
“And David said unto Nathan,
have sinned against the Lord. And
Nathan said unto David, The Lord
also had put away thy sin; thou
shalt not die.”

David's Sin

The story of David's sin, i
which a glorious, God-serving reign
is followed by such an abominable
sin, is one of the most pitiable in
all literature. The minister outlined
the steps in David's decline. First,
becoming very rich, he jumped to
the very natural conclusion that he
could do no wrong. Ile became sen-
sual. Next, he began to let Joab do.
his fighting, while he remained in
the, luxury of Jerusalem. It. still
is true, Dr. Walker said, that “an
idle brain is the devil’s workshop.”
And lastly, David took the unlawful
look, in which he saw the beautiful
woman bathing. He had hér brought
to him.

David’s whole trouble, according
to Dr. Walker, came from his try-
ing to cover up his sin. He tried
many ruses to lay the blame upon
Uriah, Bathsheba’s husbaryl, but all
of them failed. At last David .had
Uriah killed in battle, in order that
the King’s sin might not appear.
During all this time, said the min-
ister, David was living in hell. ~

Man Can Weaken

“Every man has his.ladder down
to hell,” he said, and he pdinted out
that if a king, a God fearing’ king,
can weaken, so can ordinary people.
He asked also that the people of
today be careful that acquaintance
with sin not blind them to the hid-
‘cousness of it.

“And the thing that David did
—was Mspleasing to the Lord.” «And
so God sent Nathan, the prophet to
David with the parable of the rich
man; with many sheep and the poor
one with only one lamb. When Da-
vid condemned vhe rich man for
his action in «he story, Nathan
showed him that he had condemned
himself. And Nathan warned him,
“The hand of the Lord will be
heavy upon you.”

FRESHMAN RIDES BIKE
150 MILES 10 SCHOOL

Bill White Cycles: From His
Home in Abbeville, S. C.
in Two Laps

ad

” ie}
Bill White, a member of the
Freshman class, has.ridden his hbi-
cycle from his home in Abbeville,
S. C., up to Davidson in two laps,
a total of 150 miles.

——When-Bil went home the weck-

end of the Furman game, he de-
cided he would ride his bicycle
backgto school. i. Starting Sunday’
afternoon at 1 P. M., he rode as far
as Carlyle, S. C. a total of 67 miles,
by 8:30 P. M. It was necessary
for him to store it there and to
catch ‘a bus back to school in. or-
der to meet his Monday classes.

Three week-ends passed before
he was able tp go back to Carlyle
and get it out of ‘storage. Last
Saturday afternoon, however, he

“bummed” down to Carlyle and
—startedback to Davidson at-abdqut
6 P. M. His average speed was
around 10 miles an hour. Because
of high winds, Bill had to stop in
Pineville untit it had quicted down
a bit before continuing his jaunt.
After much energy spent in facing
the wind, he arrived in Charlotte
about 2:30 A. M. At + A. M., he
arrived on the Davidson campus,
making this trip of 83 miles, to
complete the 150 mile jaunt.

Bill White is quite a cyclist.
While at home, it wasn’t infrequent
that he made trips by bicycle: to
points quite far away.
