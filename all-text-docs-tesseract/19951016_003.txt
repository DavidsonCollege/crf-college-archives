Students overwhelmingly support minors

Council for Academic Affairs recei

The Council for Academic
Affairs distributed a survey before
Fall break to poll student interest
in minors at Davidson.

Students overwhelmingly sup-
ported minors, with 336 out of 349
people saying that Davidson should
offer minors. Eleven people did
not like the idea, while two others
had no opinion.

The survey also asked students

what minors they would be inter-
ested in and if they would attempt
to pursue a minor. 255 students
responded that they would be in-
terested in a minor.

Twenty-eight. different areas
were mentioned as minors of inter-
est. English, Psychology, Spanish,
and Political Science were cited
most frequently.

Students also said that the ex-

istence of minors would not have

affected their choices of majors,
with 234 saying no, while 67 an-

swered yes. 74 out of a 109 sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors re-

sponded that they have already

taken four or more classes in an
area outside their major.

Comments on the idea of mi-
nors ranged from strongly support-
ing the idea to disagreeing whole-
heartedly.

While many students believed
that minors would benefit the lib-
eral arts education here at
Davidson, one student wrote “mi-
nors are contrary to the purpose of

a liberal arts education.”

Another student proposed that
“if minors were not offered, more
concentrations should be proposed
and adopted.”

Many students also believed
that adding minors would add to
the appeal of Davidson for pro-
spective students.

The Council for Academic
Affairs stresses that minors are not
meant to eliminate the existing
concentrations here at Davidson.
While the concentrations are inter-

ves thumbs up from students

disciplinary, the minors would be
in the study of only one discipline.

The proposal will stress that
students may choose only one mi-
nor or concentration.

There would be no double mi-
noring or combining a concentra-
tion and minor.

Finally, minors would be op-
tional for each department, mean-
ing that even if the proposal is
accepted, each department could
decide not to offer a minor.

Mock DWI arrest emphasizes theme of
Alcohol Awareness Week — Stay in Control

On Monday night an unex-
pected siren sounded at the Union
Outpost as Davidson Police Of-
ficer David Harding pulled two
Davidson students over during a
mock DWI arrest. :

Part of Alcohol Awareness
Week, the event was designed to
demonstrate specific tests involved
in DWI arrests and emphasize the
ensuing dangers of drinking and
driving.

Officer Harding participated
in the simulation with two student
volunteers. Harding began the
mock arrest by asking the driver,
Bo Craig, to disclose his license
and registration and step out of the
car.

Subsequently, Craig recited
his ABC’s into a breathalizer ma-
chine used to provide police with
an estimated alcohol content level.
Tests concluded when the impaired
driver attempted to walk in a
straight line and count to twenty-
five while holding his head back.
Finally, Harding formally arrested

Craig and detained him in the po-
lice car.

Harding said, “There’s no
need to drive drunk anywhere, es-
pecially on this campus” because
of Davidson’s small size and cen-
tralized party scene.

Craig confirmed Harding’s
comments, stating, “Eventhough I
feel that drinking and driving is not
that big of a problem on this cam-
pus, it’s still important for students
to learn the dangers of driving un-
der the influence.”

Dr. Art Flagg, the event’s co-

ordinator, stressed the need to edu- —

cate youth on the potentially. fatal
consequences of drinking and driv-
ing. He highlighted the impor-
tance of helping students to “party
smart” and make responsible deci-
sions in order to save themselves
and others.

Moreover, Flagg affirms that
drunk driving not only poses a
threat to those who drink, but isa
potential danger for friends and
bystanders as well. He urges stu-
dents to learn their limits and rec-
ognize possible hazards before they
occur.

Flagg concluded the mock
DWI arrest with the following
words to the assembled crowd,
“You’re all so young. We don’t
want to loose any of you.”

President Kuykendall spoke
and again thanked “the remnant of
the righteous” who attended con-
vocation and expressed his grati-
tude to all those who made the
_ campaign possible.

After being introduced by
Kuykendall, John Brademas, Presi-
dent Emeritus of New York Uni-
versity, spoke about the responsi-
bility of each senior to “advance
personal causes but to serve the
wider society, largely through poli-
tics.”

He said he stresses politics
because of his experience with it
and his knowledge that “there is
suchcriticism and skepticism about
politics in general.” He feels that
politics is the mode through which
“a lively democracy most effec-
tively performs, and only through

the give and take of politics can we
face the challenges before us”.
