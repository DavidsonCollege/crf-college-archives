“On-

Sports

By JOHN JOHNSON

ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION

The resignation of Dr. John Cunningham had repercus-
Sions in all phases of Davidson life, and the sports world was
very definitely affected.

Dr. Cunningham’s desire to put the athletics of the col-
lege on a non-subsidization basis and the consequential uproar
two years ago left many with the erroneous impression that
the president was a threat to a strong athletic policy.

On the contrary, a survey of the policy reveals that
during his administration, which dates from 1941, the
subsidization system has changed from a haphazard ac-
ceptance of donations earmarked for athletics to a set
number of scholarships guaranteed to the athletic depart-
ment by the school.

MONEY FOR SPORTS

In the late 1940’s Crowell Little, then head football coach,
organized the Wildcat Club, the purpose of which was to
raise funds for athletic scholarships. The Club financed to
the extent of $25,000 a year in football and $5,000 in basket-
bail.

Last year the administration took over this respon-
sibility and now guarantees 27 full scholarships to foot-
ball and eight to basketball. Since the current value of
such scholarships is $1,215, the increase in available
funds is a whopping $12,525. |

The effect of the change will not be felt until next year

and afterwards because of the lateness of the inauguration of
the policy.

FOR THE PRESENT SYSTEM

It is true that, on the direction of the trustees, Dr. Cun-
ningham did investigate the possibility of forming an Ivy
League of the South, a league he personally wants. Yet the
fact that he made an official statement recognizing its cur-
rent impossibility and supporting the present system has been
generally overlooked.

The whole nature of the athletic department's fiscal
policy has changed in the past 15 years from one of un-
organized spending to rigid budgeting and from vague infor-
mation to accurate, published statement of incomes and ex-
penditures.

Benefiting under the physical expansion of the school
during the period, the department received the new Johnston
Gymnasium and baseball diamond.

WORKED TOGETHER

The required physical training program has been in-
stigated since the war, and also the sports of rifle, soccer
and swimming were added to varsity ranks.

Commenting efter the resignation, Coach Heath
Whittle who has served es Azsistant Director of Athletics
throughout the entire period, said “Dr. Cunningham’s re-
lation with the coaching staff have always been wonder-
ful. We worked together well.”

Truly the athletic program has prospered under Dr. Cun-
ningham and it owes a debt of graditude to him.

Yankee Tank Speedster
Kicks Southern Water

By GEORGE RAMSEY

Take a sleepy-eyed freshman
from Yankecland, add a gritty de-
termination and a __ relentless
coach, mix together well. and

you've got a new entry in the
Davidson swimming records.
John Scott, lanky first year man
or cuacn George Thompson's
tanksters, has burst onto the

career to inscribe his name in the
record books opposite the entry
reading ‘200-yd. butterfly.”

Since his arrival at Davidson,
John; a Laneaster, Pa. product,
has consistently lowered his time
in his specialty, a feat which he
attributes to the constant urging
of Coach Thompson.

Since his first Intercollegi-
ate meet he has shaved ten
seconds off his mark, his best
time being the record-break-
ing 2:35.85 which he set .
against Georgia.

The Sigma Chi handball! team of
Walt Davis and Harold. Regen
overpowered the SAE’s on Wed-

season and capture the loop

The SAE's, last year’s victors,
took the ‘57 champs to a three
game final match.

The tournament remained tight
among the top four. A Phi Delt
team of John Robinson and Joe
Sandifer dropped‘ only one match,
and this to the victors, to finish
with a 10-1 record.

Third place went to the Kappa

_ (agers Battle Citadel For

Encounter At Eight P.M.
Saturday In Local Gym

By JIM HAMILTON
The Davidson College Wildcats, with their eyes on a
berth in the Southern Conference Tournament, clash with
the Citadel Bulldogs tomorrow night in the college gym at
wards, and Milner at center.

once before this season and the
Citadel barely saved face on their
own court with a squeaky 63-62
victory. The Wildcats, behind one
point, had. the ball with 17 seconds
left, but lost their chance to score
when Mintz slipped on a drive
toward the basket.

The Wildcats end their regular
sedson with three games next
week. They play host to Wofford
Tuesday night, journey to Wash-
ington and Lee Thursday night,
and return home Saturday to
tangle with VPI.

Riflemen Drop Two
Triangular Matches

Midwinters offered little inspi-
ration to the Davidson rifle team
as they dropped two triangular
matches last weekend on the lo-
cal range.

On Feb. 15 Davidson lost to W&L
and Furman, W&L was first with
1366 points, Furman second with
1356, and Davidson third with
1343.

restirig in the cellar of the con-
ference, are just one game off the
pace set by eighth place George
Washington. Davidson has won
two league games while George
Washington has taken three. On
the other hand, Davidson has
three conference games left;
George Washington has only two.
The Colonials, who have _re-
maining contests with West Vir-
ginia and VPI, are expected to
lose both, so a victory tomorrow
would probably send the Cats into
the tournament on the basis of
a better overall season record.
Davidson's record stands at 5 won,
17 lost, compared to 3 won, 17
lost for George Washington.

ALL RUGGED

The Wildcats’ other remaining
conference games ure with W&L.
and VPI. Coach Seott believes,
however, that the Citadel is the
best stepping stone to the tourna-
ment. “They are all rugged,” he
said, “but the Citadel squad is
composed largely of freshmen
while ‘Washington and Lee and
VPI are veterans.” “However,” he
added, “Citadel has improved
greatly since the first of the sea-
son.”

Citadel beat Furman last week
and defeated powerful Clemson
earlier in the season.

Citadel will probably start
Weeks and Wherry at guards,
Musselman and Growes at for-
ward, and Blackledge at center.
The team is tall, averaging ap-
proximately 6 feet 3 inches, and
fast.

Ted Weeks, a sophomore who
has spent time in the: service, and
Wherry, a freshman from Colum-
bus. Ohio..are the leading scorers.

LINEUP

Davidson will use its usual line-
up of Weeks and Mintz at guards,
Spears and Hollingsworth at for-

HANCOCK HIGH

J. B. Hancock of Furman led
all scorers with 284 points, and
Charlie Stowe and Carey Pickard
shared first place for Davidson
with 270 points.

Sat. Feb. 16, again on the home
range, Davidson lost to the Citade)
and VPI. The Citadel won with
1407 points, VPI was second with
1404 points, and Davidson third
with 1364. Charlie Stowe led the
Davidson sharpshooters with 281
points.

Belmont Abbey comes to Da-
vidson on Feb. 28 for a duel
match, and on March 1, Davidson
journeys to Furman for a triangu-
lar meet with the Paladins and
Wofford.

The last postal match of the
year was fired this afternoon
against the University of Maine
and Middlebury College, Ver-
mont.
