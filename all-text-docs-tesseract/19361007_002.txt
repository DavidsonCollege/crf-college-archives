books, one would deduce that another boom

ships of initiations are rapidly dieing out at
Davidson, Of course, it is true, and probably
always will be, that the upperclassmen will
have some fun at the expense of a few fresh-
men, and | would be the last to advocate the
‘“omplete abolition of such pranks. “Boys will

be boys,” and no one can change that!

But what are some of these so-called
changes in regard to freshmen? For example,
ven this year, a group of upperclassmen
mostly from the Y, M. C: A. Cabinet, but

partly from the Student Body at tlarge, was

m hand a week early to meet all buses and

trains, to help freshmen with their luggage

ind to help them find their rooms and to reg-

ister. In addition to this, a system of coun-
esling was set up by Dr. Gwynn in connection
with the orientation program, which system
is to be continued during the year. For every
fifteen freshmen, there is a student counselor
ind a faculty advisor to whom they can go to
seek advice on various dilemmas.

Then | believe it is an accurate observation
that the fraternities are devoting more time
and to and encouraging
freshmen to get off on the right foot in their
lessons and also in extra curricular activities.

attention helping

Further I believe it is a legitimate generaliza-
tion to, say that the upper classes as a whole
are looking more on the fréShmen as human
beings who are starting out on a new venture,
1s the ones who are the potential leaders here
at Davidson, as leaders in real life after their
college career, and as individuals who may
need some guidance, help, or encouragement
from them.

These few illustrations seem to be indicative
of a growing spirit of altruism on the part
of the upper classes toward those whom they
realize will in a few years have to carry on
in their place. Indeed, looked at from’ this
point of view, it would seem that the upper
classes are but using common sense!

then luck stepped in, and we didn’t
get the Navy’s goat after all.

Pop Warner, incidentally, predict-

would win by 30 points. If Kernel
