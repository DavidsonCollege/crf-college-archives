THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 20, 1927

Board of Education is
Entertained by College

Messrs. Rose, Tho: Thorrelson, and
Trevor Entertained by David-
son College Officials

On Wednesday, October 12th, Davidson
was host to officers and members of the Gen-
eral Election Board of North Carolina.
Those of the board who were visiting at Da-
vidson were Dr. Wickliffe Rose, president of
the board; Mr. H. J. Thorrelson, director of
the division of college and university educa-
tion, and Mr. Trevor Arnette, a member of
the board.

These gentlemen arrived at Davidson about
noon last Wednesday and were entertained at
lunch by Dr. Martin, president of the school,
and several members of the Davidson facul- e
ty. Immediately after lunch the members of
the board were taken on an inspection tour of.
the college buildings and campus. During
the course of the inspection numerous con-
ferences were held between various members
of the faculty and members of the board on
comparative methods of instruction and other
subjects related to college education.

Dr. Rose expressed himself as being de-
lighted with the expansion that Davidson has
made in the past few years, with the appear-
ance of the buildings and grounds, and with
the general atmosphere of the school.

Davidson is indeed grateful to these mem-
bers of the state educational board who have
co-operated with Davidson so cordially in
past years. They were always willing to lend
their assistance in every way when the col-
lege inaugurated their drives for funds, and
in many other ways have been of valuable as-
sistance to Davidson. Before their next
visit, it is hoped that the remainder of Cham-
bers building will be completed so that Da-
vidson will again reveal a growing school to
these men representing the state in matters
of education.

Ten Big Meets On
Debating ; Schedule

According to a statement issued by Bob
Grady, secretary of Intercollegiate Debates
for the Forensic Council, Davidson College
will undertake what is probably the most
strenuous schedule yet attempted along de-
bating lines in the history of this activity at
Davidson. The number of teams to be met,
ten in number, equals that of last year.

Two trips are planned, one to the south, go-
ing as far down as Gainesville, Fla., where
the University of Florida will be met, thence

Excellent Pictures
Scheduled for Gym

The “Y” has scheduled many good
shows for the immediate future. “Wolves
of the Air” will be shown at the Gym
Saturday night, The leading roles in
this picture of the air are acted by:
Johnnie Walker, Mildred Harris, Gayne
Whitman, Lois Boyd, Maurice Costello,
Jay Hunt and Edmund Cobb. This is an
amazing melodrama of a youth’s fight to
win an airplane race against the friend
who had stolen his factory and won. his
sweetheart, If you want adventure, if
you like thrills and spine-tingling sensa-
tions, if you prefer romance involved in
spirited action—then you will go crazy
about “Wolves of the Air.”

Other pictures to be shown are “The
Cruise of the Hellion” on November sth,
This is an adventure of the high seas, of
desperate deeds, of love and intrigue,
featuring Edna Murphy and Donald
Keith. “Wanted—A Coward,” will be
shown on November 10th. Then on No-
vember 27th come “Cat and Canary,” a
mystery of China.

On November 12th “Dynamite Dan,”

featuring ‘Kenneth McDonald will be
shown,

be met, with a concluding meet at Sewanee,
Tenn., with the University of the South,

The Northern trip will include a debate
with George Washington University, and one,
in every likelihood, with Haverford College.
The third debate for this trip has not been
selected up to this time.

Four home debates will be held, the only
one scheduled as yet, however, being with
Rutgers University. A debate with Duke
University is tentative. ‘Davidson's other two
opponents have not been selected. All of the
above referred to debates will be held during
the spring of 1928,

Davidson will be represented in debating
this year by five teams of two men each, the
tryouts for these teams to be. held in the
early part of December.

A successful season is predicted as there
is very promising material from the Fresh-
man team of last year, and in addition, five
former varsity men are back at school. These
latter men are, Henry Powell, with two
years’ varsity experience to his credit; L. K.
Pritchett, W. K. Pritchett, Tyree Piller
and Bob Grady.

No plans for the Freshman team have heed -
made as yet, although two teams will be
selected, one to meet University of North
Carolina here, and one there.

All of the Davidson touchdowns came as
the result of straight football, one touchdown
being made in each quarter. One break fa-
vored the Red ard Black machine when Elon

fumbled on her own 6-yard line in the ‘final

quarter and Davidson recovered. From here

it was short work to a touchdown, ~
Line-up and summary:

(Continued from page 1)
by Flynn, who made a number of beautiful
runs during the afternoon. Nesbit played his
usual consistent, hard-driving game.

The Elon eleven never let up in its at-
tempts to score. They frequently resorted to
the air in a series of desperate attempts to
score, and made consistent gains on their
passes, but were unable to penetrate the thin
ted line when the goal was neared. Walker,
playing at quarter for the Elonites, was their

outstanding ground gainer and tackler. At} Elon. Position. Davidson.
