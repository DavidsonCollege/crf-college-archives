TURNING THE TIDE

e

“Winning is extremely important.” This, says new|,

head fvotball coach Homer Smith, “is our objective.”

And if a likable personality and an
amount of confidence in the future are significant steps
toward achieving this goal, he won't be long in reaching
it.

Winning more Southern Conference matches is of
prime importance in Smith’s plans, as Davidson has won
only two of its last 19 league tilts. Notes the Nebraskan,
“We have got to win more conference games.”

“In the future, we will play enough conference
games every year to have a chance at the conference
championship,” he adds.

Undaunted by the disadvantages of having fewer
scholarships and higher admission requirements than
other conference schools, Smith says that “the fact that
we do have fewer scholarships and a small school will
make our efforts all the more meaningful. However,
some day we will have more scholarships.”

In addition to conference foes, he says that “we're
going to find our natural rivals, I’m not sure who they
are, and play them. For one thing, I think we should
play Princeton. We’re both Presbyterian schools and it
is sort of a natural.”

Coach Smith's optimism is somewhat contagious—
one can hardly help but feel that the skills that made him
the asset he was to the staffs at California and Air Force
combined with his optimism and confidence may turn
the tide of Davidson losing seasons.

during the period in whic
we don’t have the staff to
make it.”

Homer A. Smith, newly ap-
pointed head football coach at
Davidson College, yesterday
made this appeal for help in
recruiting football players for
his squad. Trailing an impres-
sive string of credentials, Smith
arrived New Year's night tu
take the position vacated by
coach Bill Dole.

“We have a building prob-
lem.” he said. “We don’t ex-
pect to go out and beat Pres-

byterian 100-0 this year. We
will have to put together things
step by step.”
NO AID YET

Concerning the assistant
coach situation, Smith stated,
“It would be impossible to even
mention names without giving
the wrong impression. Nothing
has been decided yet that can
be released.”

Dr. Tom Scott, college ath-
letic director, gloated, “We are
delighted with our choice. We
are all very pleased that he
accepted. He has the back-
ground and all that goes with
it to be a great coach at David-
son.”

Smith is friendly person who
makes a real effort to know
the people that he meets and
to greet them by their first
names. His cheerfulness gives
him a calmness that cannot
really be upset by smal! mat-
ters.

He tells the story about his
now famous lost luggage this
way: “My luggage got’ lost
somewhere between Denver
and Chicago, and I was really
mad because I had been told
the wrong thing. When I got
here I really wanted to let
some body have it.

“But whenever I answered
the phone, they would say,
‘Homer Smith? You're the new
football coach et Davidson,
aren't you?’ Then I just could-
n't stay mad."

The friendliness of the Dav-
idson atmosphere will be one
of Smith’s selling points when
he recruits. He told a Satur-
day night news conference that
he would try to impress pros-
pects with the degree offered
¢| by Davidson College and the
“pure form of college life that
exists at Davidson.”

Smith is an old hand at the
all-important business of re-
cruiting. “I learned to recruit
defore I learned to coach,” he
said. His first coaching job
was at Stanford where the was
freshman football coach and
- head of the recruiting program.

could help him in sanderstanding
a quarterback’s problems. When
he gets his timing back. he
should be fine. He's quite coach-
able: and highly intelligent. so I
know they will give him a long
look.

“He will have to gain some
weight (Heckard is 63°, and
weighs 185) and he's: going to
start the weight-lifting program
they asked him to do very
soon.”

Y

HIGH SCHOOL HERO

His athletic abilities first
came to light in track. At Ben-
son High School where he was
graduated in 1949, he earned
two letters in football, three
in basketball and four in track.
He was AllCity in both track
and football, and All-State in
track.

Smith ¢hen went to the East
where he attended Lawrence-
ville School, a highly regard-
ed preparatory school in New
Jersey. He lettered twice
there and was named to the

All-State Football Team.

From Lawrenceville he went
to Princeton University. There
he was an excellent all-around
student.

Smith graduated cum leude
in economics.

He was elected president
of his class in his sophomore,
junior and senior years.

Stating it mildly, his ath-
letic record at Princeton was
outstanding as he participat-
ed in track and football.

His first visit to North
Carolina came duiring those
days as a member of the track
squad that competed at Notrh
Carolina and Duke.

“Football was even more his
piece of pie. “If I were not
now a coach, I would remem-
ber myself as more of a play-
er than I do now. I see that
I was just an eversge player.

‘Those were some of the
greatest years of Princeton foot-
ball,” mused Smith. “It was
only natural that one of the
backs would be lucky. I was
just fortunate enough to have
@ dew good days.”

During his sophomore and
junior years, Princeton lost
only one game. The Tigers
were Ivy League champions
both years.. They received the
Lambert Trophy signifying
that they were the best team
in the East.

IVY RECORD

The statistics, however. belic
his personal modesty. In 1953
the seta punting record at
Princeton by booting the pig-
skin for an average of 40 yards.
He set the still-standing Ivy
League record of 273 yards

rushing in a single game against
Harvard.

For his efforts the “lucky’’
back who happened to “have a
good day’’ was named to the
All-Ivy and All-East teams. He
also made Honorable Mention
All -American. During his senior
year the was captain of the
Tiger squad.

After a two-year tour of duty
with the U. S. Army at Fort
SiN, Okla., he headed back to
the campus. He attended Stan-
ford University where he earn-
ed a Master's Degree in Busi-
ness Administration.

While doing his graduate
work, Smith took on the job
of coaching the freshman foot-
ball squad. After graduation he
remained at Stanford to work
as a full-time coach for the
Junior Varsity and as head of
the recruiting program.

HIGH-POWERED OFFENSE

During this period Stanford
was a nationally renowned of-
fensive power. The' squad led
the nation in forward passing,
receiving, total offense, and
scoring.

They had the highest percent-
age of pass completions for a
single game. The national re-
cord for individual passing in
a single game was tied.

In 1961 Smith took|the fob of
assistant et ¢he Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs,
Colo., as defensive dacidfield
coach. After two seasons in this
position he moved to offensive
backfield coach.

Head coach Ben Martin of
the Academy introduced his
“Flexible-T’' offensive forma-
tion at this time, and Homer
Smith was credited with being
“The man directly responsible
for making the ‘Flexible-T’
go"

In Smith's first season as
offensive backfield coach, the
Falcons went all the way to
the Gator Bowl in Florida.

During the past season the
Air Force Academy managed
only a 45-1 record against
such opposition as Michigan,
Notre Dame, and Washington.
Important, however, was the
fact that Smith's backfield con-
tinued to set new offensive re-
cords for the Academy.
