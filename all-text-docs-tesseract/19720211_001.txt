Over 90 per cent of those stu-
dents who responded to a recent
poll on coeducation favored an
increase in the number of wom-
en students at Davidson.

Of the 891 questionnaires dis-
tributed to all on-campus stu-
dents by the Educational Policy
Committee’s Subcommittee on
Coeducation, 537 were returned.
Of that number 487 answered af-

firmatively, 29 were opposed,
and 21 were undecided.
Slightly more than 60 per

cent of the questionnaires were
returned. While this was much
less than the subcommittee had
hoped for it was greater than
that of many questionnaires in
the past.

Students Favor Coeducation

Brown Patterson, chairman of
the subcommittee, expressed dis-
appointment ‘‘that a larger per-
centage of students did not re-
ply.” However, both Patterson
and Jody Turner, who is stu-
dent representative on the sub-
committee, were pleased that
the results were so favorable to
coeducation. Both felt that pos-
sibly the reason that little more
than 60 per cent were returned
is that students did not realize
the importance of this particu-
lar questionnaire. Patterson said
that the questionnaire represents
an accurate picture of the stu-
dent body’s feelings. He indicat-
ted that he has ‘‘no reason to
believe that those who didn’t
return it would have answered
differently than those who did.”

Almost 94 per cent of the ques-
tionnaires which were returned
agreed that Davidson would
have a more natural environ-
ment if it were coed. Only four
per cent disagreed.

The majority of the student
body shares the concern of the
Admission Office over the qual-
ity of those seeking admission.
Of those who returned the ques-
tionnaire 458 agreed and 160
disagreed that Davidson must
become coed if it is to continue
to recruite outstanding appli-
cants.

Sixty nine per cent of those
who expressed an opinion
thought that coeducation would
cause the college’s academic

' standards to rise, however, 44

per cent of those replying were

Senate Considers Priorities

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

Action in the SGA _ Senate
meeting this Tuesday centered
on examination of the Senate’s
priorities, an appeal for improv-
ed security, and a discussion of
self-scheduled exams.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
initiated a discussion of direc-
tions the Senate should take for
the remainder of this year and
next fall.

Suggestions from senators in-
dicated much concern on the
issues of coeducation, govern-
ance, the social system, coun-
seling programs, the proposed
Grievance Committee and stu-
dent representation on faculty
committees.

Peeples later said that he had
discussed the idea of a griev-
ance committee with Dean of
Students Will Terry, and that,
“there definitely will be one.”
Junior Senator Mike Creasman
and Freshman Senator John

Hornickel were appointed as
student representatives to that
committee.

Peeples also asked for volun-
teers to form a task force which
will work for student represen-
tation on faculty committees
which do not presently have
student members, especially the
Budget, Building and Grounds
Committee and the Admissions
Committee.

In addition to concrete issues,
the overall philosophy of the
Senate was subject to sugges-
tions. There were repeated ex-
pressions of the possibility that
the Senate could get overly in-
volved with procedure and
thereby neglect the very con-
stituents it attempts to repre-
sem.

Senators emphasized the ne-
cessity to be a funnel for stu-
dents’ ideas and to react to
them, the importance of re-
maining involved with impor-
tant issues that may threaten to
die out, and the need for im-
proved communication between
the Senate and the student body.

“From hearing these propos-
als, it’s clear that if they’re car-
ried out, this will be one of the
most successful Senates ever,”
Peeples observed.

Junior Senator Bill Meier pre-
sented a resolution that the se-

curity program be improved.
“The college has a responsibil-
ity in this area to the students,
especially to the coeds,” he said.

Meier proposed that the Sen-
ate urge the college to hire a suf-
ficient number of men to pro-

EPC Study Shows
Decline In All-Male
Institutions To 37

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

Davidson is one of only 37
all male senior colleges left in
the nation. This discovery and
others pertaining to the trend
towards coeducation by former-
ly single sex colleges were
made by Assistant Professor of
Biology David C. Grant as part
of his duties as a member of
the Coeducational Subcommittee
of the Educatinal Policy Com-
mittee.

not sure.

Many people have felt that
Davidson would lose its distinc-
tiveness if it were to become
coed, but 62 per cent of the stu-
dents who completed the ques-
tionnaire did not concur, nor did
they feel that it would lose the
important advantages of its all
male environment.

The argument that coeduca-
tion would cause an unhealthy
increase in sexual relations met
strong disagreement. The tabu-
laticn shows that 92 per cent
disagree. A large majority felt
that instead students would be-
come less preoccupied with sex
and be able to establish mean-
ingful relationships with wom-
en.

A more than average number
of students responded to the ar-
guments concerning fimancia] as-
pects of coeducation by mark-
ing ‘“‘not sure”. Thirty five per
cent were not sure if Davidson
could attract more full paying
students, 28 per cent were not
sure if the cost of becoming co-
ed would be too high, and 42
per cent indicated that they did
not know what effect it might

Grant constructed a graph
which showed that the number
of all male institutions has drop-
ped from 111 in 1967 to 37 in the
spring of 1971. If the projected
trend continues, there will be
no all male colleges by 1973.

Grant cautioned, “‘It is very
dangerous to draw conclusions
from limited data such as this.
You can propose all types of
interpretations of my graph.

“However, it is clear that
over a four year period an ap-
parent linear drop in the num-
ber of single sex colleges has
occurred. What is far more im-
portant than this is the absolute
drop in the number of single

~ sex schools.”

Grant pointed out that the ab-
solute drop in the number of all
male colleges was far greater
than most people had thought,
and many members of the Edu-
cational Policy Committee were
surprised to learn that Davidson
is a member of such a quickly
diminishing minority of schools.

Also counted among the 37
schools are technical, military,
and Catholic institutions. Grant
did not establish if the remain-
ing 37 all male colleges were of
Davidson's caliber. Also, Grant
did not ascertain the number of
all male institutions which have
ceased to exist since 1967.

Grant said, ‘My graph brings
into focus that a few years de-
lay in Davidson’s going coedu-
cational will make a difference.

“Everyone else has seen the
writing on the wall, and they
have gone coeducational. If the
trend continues, there will be
no all female colleges by 1978.”’

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan was so
impressed by Grant’s graph that
he sent! a copy to each member
of the faculty Wednesday.
