Officials To Visit

Alumni Groups

Professor Archibald Currie an-
nounced last Monday that he and
Fred Smith, alumni secretary of
the college, were planning to
take a trip during spring holi-
days.

Their purpose is to visit sev-
eral alumni chapters. Monday
night, March 29, they are going
to be in Richmond at an alumni
meeting there, going on to New
York Tuesday night. Professor
Currie is going as a representa-
tive of the college, and Fred
Smith in line of his duties, Pro-
fessor Currie plans to start about
Saturday night, spending Sunday
with his brother in Richmond. He
is planning to spend a day in
Washington on his way back.

Mr.. F: L. Jackson, college
treasurer, and Fred Smith went
to Winston-Salem last Saturday
to attend an alumni chapter
meeting there. Both made ad-
dresses before the meeting.

have to move before the picture is
over,

Then the picture or feature really
gets under way. The hero of the
picture is the one who gets the bad
breaks. He is booed and if he were
in person he’d probably quit the
show business and settle down. The
villian of the picture is the one who
benefits. He is greeted with ap-
plause .by the students, for they all
are a blood-thirsty crew. Emotion-
al scenes are “fresh meat” to the
Davidson students. They are glut-
tons for these scenes. They ask the
operator to hold the machine and
let the scene stay for a bit, But,
alas! no results.

Go to the show and watch the
Davidson students put on a show,

during the show, in the show.

FRAMPTON 10 PLAY
FINALS WITH LOYD

Tenney and Lindsey Fall in
Ping-Pong Semi-Finals

The Table Tennis Tournament of
1936-37 has now advanced to the
final match. Smashing their way to
victory over five opponents each,
H. Frampton and E, L. Cloyd have
slowly but surely crept up the list
of some seventy aspirants to this
coveted championship.

Both men have risen from
first match to the final with com- |
parative ease, neither having yet
received a single defeat. Cloyd has
defeated Hemphill, Hashagen, Arm-
strong, Spencer and Lindséy in his
five pairings. His last match was
with Lindsey in the semi-finals and
he was able to overcome his op-
ponent to the tune of 2-0. Framp-
ton has had jousts with Shabel,
Bradburn, K. McLean, and Tenney.
Each time emerging the victor.
Tenney went down before Framp-
ton’s drives in the semi-finals.

In an interview Frampton refused |
to make any statement concerning |
the outcome of the final game but!
he did say that, Weather permitting, |
the match would be played off in|
the Davidson Y. M. C. A. on Tues- |
day. Cloyd could not be reached
for an interview.

Young Politicians |
In Washington

Washington, mecca of lobbyists,
experienced a new type of lobby re-
cently. The lobby of young people
who came here to urge passage of
the American Youth Act contrasted
strangely with the more experienced
and skillful wielders of
pressure. The young group made
up in sincerity and enthusiasm,
however, what it lacked in wire-
pulling skill. To one who has often
watched the machinations of shrewd
and calculating lobbyists backed by
vast expense accounts, it is refresh-
ing to see clear-eyed, eager college
men and women go after an objec-
tive they want.

Rags, Old Newspapers

“Rags, rags, old newspapers.”
Girls at N. J. College for Women
don't actually go around from house
to house shouting for old rubbish,
but they do save it.

In order to boost their gym fund,
they sell all rags and newspapers
that would otherwise collect noth-
inig but dust. A while ago they put
their gym fund back on the “silver-
paper” standard by collecting tin

foil from candy bars, gum, and

| other articles.

(Continued from Page 7)

In the two upper classes, there
an entirely different situation.
There are only 41 juniors and 38
seniors taking the advance courses
in R. O. T. C. Stiff qualifications
are in force, and agreements are
made with the War Department in
Washington before the student is
able to take the advanced course.
This is the factor that makes the
situation in the first and second
years become vice versa in the third
and fourth. There is a total of 365
students in Davidson College tak-

GIRLS, HERE IS
“THE” ONE

The fact that Alexander Franklin
Wojciechowicz, Fordham’s brilliant
center, was such dn_ insignificant
high school freshman that his coach
refused him a uniform ig only one
odd item about him.

Fiye feet eleven, and 192 pounds,
he plays a bruising game and is
hailed by some critics as the great-
est center in Fordham’s history. One
of Wojciechowicz’s hobbies is cro-
cheting. When at home he often
helps his mother make rag rugs. He
likes to cook, too.

But if you think that his cro-
cheting and cooking make him soft,
just talk to a few of the centers he
has faced.

FRESHMAN BALL PLAYERS

(Continued from Page 5)
many boys at the plate. “This fault”
he said, “is that they do not fol-
low through, when they swing. Any
man who has the correct swing, and
follows through in his swing can
learn to hit,” he stated.

After batting practice, the in-
fielders were put through a short
and snappy drill on ground balls.
Several of the boys showed their
ability by handling the ball, with
ease. The outfield aspirants were
run hither and yon, trying to snag
the long drives from the bat of the
coach.

Several of the men out show con-
siderable promise, although it is
too early to make any predictions,
as yet. The following men are
candidates for the team: Bill Boll-
ing, Dan Cagle, Toni Casali, Jim
Curry, Jim Dunford, Punk Fitzger-
ald, Bud Gilmore, Tom Hafnsberg-
er, Walter Harper, Bennry Harri-
son, Fred Hashagen, Karl Hudson,
Lock Hunter, Gray Hunter, John
Jones, Bob Kellog, Bill King, Dave
McClean, Graham McFayden, Bob
Phipps, Buck Powell, Marvin Sow-
ers, Jim Thomas, Hugh Verner, and
Dick Winters.

The freshman baseball schedule
has not as yet been announced, but
it will probably include several
games with leading junior college
teams of the state.

Marriage or Career?

Senior women students at Penn-
sylvania State College have agreed
that marriage and a career cannot
be combined successfully.

An overwhelming majority of the
190 girls that took part in the poll
declared that a career after mar-
riage is not fair to the husband nor
to the single girls who are out of
work.

A. L. CURRIE TALKS

(Continued from Page 1)
Keep Thy Heart

“Out of the heart flows forth the
issues of life.” “The heart is the
reservoir of a man’s faith—of his
faith and hope and love.” With
these statements Mr. Currie urged
the students today in chapel to fol-
low the example of Christ and keep
their hearts in the face of difficul-
ties and unless they did they were
beaten from the start. Quoting the
familiar passage, “Let not your
heart be troubled,” Rey. Currie im-
pressed the conviction that this was
not only a passage for the comfort
of those in sorrow but Christ’s com-
mand to meet all phases of life cour-
ageously.

Three more services remain to be
held, one tonight and two tomorrow,
After concluding this series, Mr.
Currie will remain on the campus
until Sunday when he will lead the
vesper service.

“Buck” Currie is a Davidson grad-
uate, class of '’21, and a_ native
North Carolinian.

be beneficial and it might keep
students on the campus who go to
Charlotte or Greensboro to get this
form of recreation.”

Dunlap Covington: “I don’t feel
that it would fit in with other things
at Davidson. But personally I
think it would be beneficial to the
student by giving him something to
occupy his time.”

“A college man should be allowed
to exercise his personal inclinations;
except it trespass upon the rights
of others.”—Al Cade.
