THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 21, 1924

Open Forum

(Continued from page 4)

He adds insult to abuse by terming us
a bunch of “cheap skates.” ‘We passed
the motion to raise the athletic fee with-
out objection. Reasonable taxes are one
thing but because the harassed student,
besieged on every hand by petty assess-
ments, charges and dues attempts to ob-
ject and question why does that prove
him a cheap skate? Calling the stu-
dent body cheap skates is not only. un-
deserved but slanderous.

He closes with a fling of destructive
criticism at college athletics. What kind
of spirit is he displaying when he states
that he not intend to go to
Davidson play Trinity this spring be-
cause we have no chance of winning?
First cast out the mote from thy own
eye, brother.

The writer stood near our friend dur-
ing the Wake Forest game and noted
that he was one of the leaders in the
verbal assult on referee Bethel. Is not
that a greater reflection on school spirit
than imagining we have the best school
in the South? The former makes one
lose respect for himself. The latter even
if false makes him love and admire the
old college.

cat's fur the wrong way lately. The
idea in a college education is to train
one to meet the problems of life. We
have been challenged to face facts and
after doing so to the best of our ability

losing time and money by remaining here.
Nor are we shunning all thought of
responsibility. There are sources of
strength our friend has not held up to
us. Weare slowly growing into power to
meet the problems of life; securing a lit-
tle of this power here, a little there, some
in the class-room, some on the athletic
field, some in bull sessions, some in as-
sociations, and a wee mite by thinking.
These problems as said are different for
our individual members. Most of them
will be other than the task of interpret-
ing Contemporary Thought as Displayed

Those who bring chairs are careless

of the gym on Saturday night is neces-

should be taken of the floor.

During the week, no one in street shoes
should walk on the floor. The gym floor
is for the use of the students but not
for those students who are not willing to
co-operate with the coaches and see that
certain rules in regard to care of the

GION MUST BE

| SAYS RELI
MADE MORE REAL

Delivering the monthly university ser-
mon here Sunday night, Rev. J. H. Barn-
hardt, pastor of the West Market Street
Methodist Church, of Greensboro, said:
“We have reached the point in our reli-
gious development where, if we are to
advance at all satisfactorily, there must
be a fuller—not necessarily a different—
interpretation given to the Gospel than
it has ever had before.”

Dr.’ Barnhardt emphasized at the out-
set that he was not going to discuss the
moderinists or fundamentalists that his
views should not be construed as siding
with or against either. The point he want-
ed to make, he declared, was that religion
must be taken out of the sanctuaries of
the church and made more of a prac-
tical, every-day, living force if it is to
keep pace with our changing civilization.

In the midst of his sermon the minister
asked how many of the students present
were members of churches in their home
towns and called for a vote by hands.
Virtually every hand went up. He then
wanted to know many had ever
attended prayer meeting and again most
of the hands went up. Dr. Barnhardt
said that such a vote was most gratify-
ing. The sermon was delivered in Ger-
rard hall. The main floor was comfor-
tably filled with students and there were
a number in the balcony. President
Chase was present—Charlotte Observer.

CORNELIUS-RIVER ROAD IS
OPENED TO PUBLIC TRAVEL

Hard-surfacing of the Cornelius-River
road has been completed and the highway is
now open for traffic. It is four and a half
miles in length, connecting with the Beatty’s
Ford road a mile from the Catawba river.
The final mile of the road to the river is
sandclay.

A convict force is now working on dirt
headers for the road, Six feet of dirt road
is on either side of the hard surface.

The Nalle Construction Company had the
contract for the road. The cost was slightly
less than $25,000 a mile, the total contract
price being approximately $106,000.

This is the last-hard-surface project to be
undertaken at this time by the county, lack
of finances preventing any more work of
the kind. If additional projects are under-
taken, funds will have to be forthcoming,
road officials say, pointing out that the $2,-
000,000 bond issue is practically exhausted.
Lloyd highway engineer, is of the
opinion that the highways needing most at-
tention and which should be hard-surfaced
next are the road from the Lawyers road to
Mint Hill, the Beatty's Ford road and the
Sharon-Pineville road.—Charlotte Observer.
