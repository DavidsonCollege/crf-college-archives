Seven films offered true
"blast from the past"

The success and significance
of this year’s “Blast from the Past”
Film Festival was something that
needed to be seen to be truly ap-
preciated. Following this year’s
first 900 Room feature, Shine, we
were met with
a film which
resides on the
opposite end of
the cinematic
spectrum, Willy
Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory. This is the
sort of film that you might catch
me watching at home with my kid
sister on a lazy Saturday after-
noon; this week, however, it was
inthe company
of sixty student
Wonka fanat-
ics Sunday
night at the
Outpost. Not
only was this a
near-capacity
crowd, but
most of the au-
dience was un-
afraid to laugh
and sing along
with the
Oompa-
Loompas, just
as if we were
all eight-year-olds again. Thank-
fully, most of the audience cried
along in mockery of Charlie
Bucket’s mother’s “Cheer up,
Charlie” lullaby, a public admis-
sion that we would not be sucked
in by the inherent cheesiness. The
most fascinating aspect of the film
festival was that we are now older,
more perceptive, and much more
astute than’ we were in the 80s,
allowing us to
pickup ona few
of the more ma-
ture intricacies
of these
children’s
films. Most no-
table among
these instances
was when the
computer engi-
neer becomes
rather irate with
his golden ticket locating device.

Computer: I won’t tell [where
the remaining tickets are located. ]
That would be cheating.

Engineer: I am now telling the
computer. . .that I will gladly share
with it the grand prize.

Computer: What would acom-
puter do with a lifetime supply of
chocolate?

Say Anything

‘RETROSPECTIVE

Wes Goldsberry

@ Cusak can’t help being smooth in.

Engineer: [fuming] I am now
telling the computer EXACTLY
what it can do witha lifetime supply
of chocolate!

This went way over my head
when I was 10.

The next fea-
ture was Back to
the Future on
Monday night.
After originally
deciding not to
. watch this one
because I'd seen it more than a few
times before, I was convinced. to
take a break from my studies and
see Marty McFly hit 88 MPH yet
again. It was still a smart, funny,

@ Einstein travels forward in time in Back to the

inspiring movie which left every-
one humming Huey Lewis songs as
the audience left the Outpost. The
scene in which Biff runs his car into
a’manure truck never gets old, and
was met with a jubilant viewer re-
sponse. Plus, Marty saves the day
on a skateboard! Whatever hap-
pened to those?
Tuesday’s Outpost feature, Foot-
loose, also played to an apprecia-
tive crowd.
Kevin
Bacon’s ex-
pression of
surprise,
“Jump
back!” stuck
out like a
sore thumb.
Wednes-
day the
venue
shifted up
the hill to the 900 Room for a double
feature of Say Anything and Weird
Science, which played to more mod-
est crowds. I had not seen Say

Anything before, but it was:

debateably the best movie of them
all from a “feel-good” standpoint.
John Cusack’s character makes it a
modern classic. Weird Science was
allegedly “awful,” but that’s what

age

@ Ferris and Cameron harass the oposition in Ferris Bueller's Day Off,
the most popular film of the series

@ Gene Wilder stands in his

makes it an 80s icon, right?
Sixteen Candles showed Thurs-
day night (would the event have
been complete without a Molly
Ringwald movie?) fol-
lowed by the grand
finale,Ferris Bueller's
Day Off on Friday
night. Ferris played to
a 900 Room audience
of about 150 people,
_nearly three times
more than prior mov-
ies had garnered.

Not only were the
movies fun in them-
selves, but half of them
were free to attend.
Each movie was also
followed by a small
raffle for movie post-

ers and various little toy things. The
“kid films” series was very well-
received by the student body. Hope-
fully it will become an annual tradi-
tion. ‘

HIs Furry WoopLAND ANIMALS

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)

There is a strong charice that you will be ripped limb from limb
by horny, rabid African hippos . Best bet: avoid the Zambezi
river basin at all costs.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)

Your lucky number is 1-800-444-CASH. Ask Mr. Cash and you
shall receive. But be advised, your dorm room has very little
home equity.

Hug bunnies. Love your fellow man. Try to ignore the fact that
life is a hopeless downward spiral to a painful, lonely death.
Lucky psychological disorder: manic depression.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)

Can you say prison sex? I hope you can, because you will go to
jail, and your cellmate, Leroy, will like you. A lot. You should
have listened to the stars and hired the Unfrozen Caveman
Lawyer.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)

You will begin.to use fake Davidson slang, such as "Chez Vail"
and "the 'braire" in your everyday speech. Best bet: take a
semester off and don't come back until you can bitch about the
workload in plain English like the rest of us.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)

You will experience a catastrophic world-wide economic de-
pression. ‘Best bet: hoard toilet paper and wait for the
hyperinglation. Lucky tariff: Hawley-Smoot Tariff

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)

The stars refuse to tell me about you. This is likey a bad sign.
Best bet: stay in bed, pull the covers over your head, and hope
with all your mortal soul that astrology really is fake.

Aries (March 21-April 19)

Your evil twin will assume your identity, ruin your credit rating,
impregnate your girlfriend, and annihilate the population of
Argentina. The world will revile you for things not of your
doing, and you will have no recourse but suicide.

Taurus (April 20-May 20)

You will be chosen as the puppet leader of a banana republic.
You should try to rid yourself of any moral opposition to the
cocaine trade. Lucky America: Central.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Your dog will die. Lucky for you, there are plenty of unloved,
living animals at the pound. Best bet: Get a chia pet. Name him
Earl.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)
You will finally get a chance to use those PE 101 skills! A

Resusci-Annie doll sitting next to you at Vail will choke on her
Student Steak and owe her life to you.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)
Your girlfriend is an ethereal golden goddess. Little lion, be nice

to your pussy cat this week, or while the lion is away, the kitty
will play.

We’re not news.
We’re not sports.
We’re not opinions.
We’re everything else.
