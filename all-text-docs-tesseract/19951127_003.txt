Morality

Philosopher Richard Garner uses anti-realist a

By ANDREW. PRESTON
Staff Writer

Arguing against popular wis-
dom, a philospher last week told a
Davidson audience that morality
is a useless human creation and
can even be dangerous and justify
for evil.

Richard Garner addressed the
topic of his paper, “Morality : Who
Needs It?” in the Morrison Room
on Monday, November 13.

Garner feels that moral be-
liefs are false and that morality
may even be a dangerous institu-
tion.

useless,

Garner began his lecture with
his belief that morality is a human
invention and that, in fact, moral
beliefs are false.

He backed up this claim with
the theory of anti-realism, which
States that morals are not actual
qualities in objects but sujective
internal perceptions. If moral be-
liefs are not objective, then they
must be false.

Garner adds that “it is danger-
ous torely onan institution built on
error and wishful thinking ... W
all want a world of peace ... But

morality is not going to get us
there, and we probably don’t even

need it.”

Based on the belief that moral
beliefs are false, Garner argued
that morals are dangerous in that
we are lying every time we use
them. “When others learn we have
lied, we will no longer be able to
count on being believed,” he says.

Also, if morals are not based
on facts, Garner argues. that oppo-
site sides of every issue could jus-
tify their beliefs based on their
own set of morals. “We could ra-
tionalize discrimination by appeal-
ing to our superiority ... Every
argument from equality can be
countered with one from liberty,”

Writing Center flourishes

in inaugural semester

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

This year, students don’t only
go down to the East end of Cham-
bers basement for the psychology
labs.

From Sunday through Thurs-
day, the Writing Center, located in
room B-6 in Chambers basement
is Open to students from 7 to9 p.m.
and also from 2 to 4 p.m. Sundays.

' The Writing Center was be-
gun this year by English professor
Shireen Carroll. At the beginning
of the Fall semester, Carroll adver-
tised a new class/internship en-
titled Writing Pedagogy and Prac-
tice. Four students enrolled in her
class, in which they were trained to
become Writing Center tutors.

The four peer tutors are re-
quired to dedicate four hours a
week to tutoring. The remaining
hour is spent in class, where they
discuss theories on writing, and
ways to operate the Writing Center
without breaching Davidson’s
Honor Code.

Initially, Carroll asked pro-
fessors to submit their opinions on

how much they felt tutors should
help students. Writing Center tu-
tors continually keep professors
informed by sending them session
evaluations.

So far, Carroll says, “Faculty
feedback on tutorial sessions has
been quite positive.”

Carroll says she is also pleased
with student interest in the Writing
Center. So far, tutors have con-
ducted 69 tutorial sessions. Thirty-
four students have used the Writ-
ing Center. All years have been
represented, though the majority
of clients have been freshmen.

“I’m delighted with student
interest-in the Writing Center so
far,” Carroll says. “And I’m sure
that as information gets out about
the Center, we’ll see an increasing
amountof students, including more
students who are not just entering
Davidson.”

Subjects for papers range from
what Carroll calls “predictable”
classes such as English, Humani-
ties, philosophy, art history, and
political science to the sciences,
including psychology and biology.
Tutors have also encountered a

few Center majors writing theses.

Carroll encourages students to
go to the Writing Center at any
stage of the writing process, even
to discuss ideas.

A tutor’s goal is to help the
student with their writing process,
not just with editing and proof-
reading a single paper. One pro-
fessor told Carroll that a student
had told his whole class that the
“(Writing Center] helped me help
myself.”

Carroll predicts that more stu-
dents will visit the Writing Center
during “crunch time” between
Thanksgiving and Christmas. She

suggests that students come in as -

early as possible, due to the fact
that tutors do not have appoint-
ment schedules and sometimes
there is only one tutor in the Cen-
ter. Each tutorial sessions last for
a half-hour.

Carroll’s class/internship will
be offered again next semester.

Enough interest has already.
been demonstrated so that Carroll
anticipates that the process of en-
tering the class will be competi-
tive.

he argues.

Despite his rejection of 1 mo-
rality, Garner does not feel that a
person who lacks morality will act
badly. He explains that “being
immune to moral
considerations need not mean be-
ing unmoved by the suffering of
others.”

“Infact, Garner mentioned feel-
ings such as sympathy, compas-
sion, and kindness as a substitute,
for morality.

In Garner’s eyes, these feel-
ings do not-need to be justified by
aa butare their own motiva-

dangerous, speaker says

rgument to defend claim that morality is subjective and therefore false

_ “If you care about someone,
there is no problem about motiva-
tion. If you merely think it is your
duty to help someone, it will al-
ways be possible to dig up some
moralist excuse for not doing any-
thing.”

Garner is currently Professor
of Philosophy at Ohio State Uni-
versity. He earned his Ph.D. from
the University of Michigan and
has written such works as Beyond
Morality.

Garner has been known to use
a wide variety of sources in his
works, from Chinese philosophy
to Hitler to Duran Duran.

Some action
being taken on
RLO Survey

By Matruew Eiricu

Chair of the Student Advisory
Council (SAC) to the Director of
Residence Life Sara Beth Hamlin
reported at the SGA meeting Tues-
day that some action was being
taken in response to the SAC’s
survey from four weeks ago.

One prevalent request from

_ the survey was for cable in dorm

rooms. Hamlin said that when the

each room.

However, Hamlin said that to
wire cable into the rooms of dorms
which are not being renovated is
very difficult. She said that the
procedure would be very cumber-

_ some, logistically difficult, and

very costly.

Hamlin said RLO thought it it
best to wait for the campus to be
networked with fiber optics which
could easily bring cable to stu-
dents’ rooms.

RLO has no plan yet about
students’ request for more and bet-
ter washers and dryers. RLO says
the money is ‘not available and
students indicated that they will
not pay for the machines, consid-

ering it a part of their tuition.
Many seniors’ surveys said
they would like to be able to stay in
their apartments past graduation.
The present policy requires seniors
to vacate their apartments by 5
p.m. on the day of graduation.
Hamlin explained the policy
is necessary for a number of fac-
tors, including timing the RA’s
moving out, moving in students
who will be living in the apart-
ments for the Summer, keeping ihe

Phayseal lagi extra security.

Also, she said RLO is worried
that seniors will damage the apart-
ments if they stay past graduation.

SGA President Bill Gullan
called the latter reason “crap” and
“one of the most insulting things
I’ve heard at my time at Davidson.”

One senator pointed out that
because seniors will not have
checked out, they will be still re-
sponsible for any damage done to
their apartments.

Also, senators who worked
with RLO denied that allowing
seniors to stay a little longer would
be a problem.

Hamlin said a sub-committee
would be established to address
this issue.
