THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 7, 1958

(Al Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Honor Council Should

Be Separate Body

The DAVIDSONIAN purposes a re-
organization of the Student Govern-
ment of Davidson College.

Our purposal would separate the
present system into a Student Coun-
cil and an Honor Council. The Stu-
dent Council would deal exclusively
in matters of legislation; the Honor

Council would serve as an honor
court. This is a natural separation of

powers.

As any organization grows, so do
its duties and responsibilities. David-
son College is expanding both in num-
bers, and in its duties as. an educa-
tional institution. Just as the Inter-
fraternity Council has laid the ground-
work upon which future growing fra-
ternity importance wil] be based. so
we feel that the Student Government
should prepare to meet Davidson's
new future.

Advantages of Separation

The advantages of a _ separate
Honor Council would be three-fold.
First. it would free the Student Coun-
cil from trial duties. and enable them

to devote their entire efforts to legis-
lation and to student body problems.

Second, an appointed Honor Coun-
cil would be free from any political
pressures which could and might be
exerted on an elected officer, and
would consist of experienced capable
men.

Thirdly. since an Honor Council
would be devoted exclusively to cases
involving violations of the honor sys-
tem and of student body regulations.
it could spend its entire time on im-
proved investigation and trial proce-
dure. Members of this Honor Coun-
cil would be ineligible to hold any
other student body office. This would
benefit both the Student Council and
the student body as a whole.

Again. if the much-discussed
“drinking rule” is liberalized, then
there wili be a need for some special
body to strictly enforce the new regu-
lations.

Make-up of Council

The Honor Council would: differ
in make-up from its parent body, the
Student Council, in that its members
would be appointed to hold office
throughout their entire college career.
and could be, removed only in in-
stances where they might be involved
in honor violations themselves.

The members of the Honor Coun-
cil would be nominated by a joint

committee of faculty and students,
with the Student Body President ser-
ving as the chairman of the commit-
tee. The Student Council would ap-
prove the nominees by a two-thirds
vote.

Membership

Two members would be appointed
from the Sophomore class, three from
the Junior class, and four from the
Senior class. In each case, we repeat,
the members would hold office dur-
ing their entire college career. Hence,
in anv given vear, after the third year
of its operation, the Honor. Council
would consist of two men with two
year's experience, and three additional
ones with a year’s experience. The
chairman of the Honor Court would

be selected from that body's member-

ship by the Student Council.
Need and Action

We believe that “new occasions
teach new duties” and that such an
oceasion has arisen. This system, bor-
rowed from others, and improved,
would in turn make our Student Gov-
ernment be emulated by other schools.

We strongly urge the Student
Council to investigate the possibility
and practicality of such a separation
of powers.—G.L.W.

Phone Booth

The free. direct telephone ex-
change to Charivite is one of the most
convenient services offered to stu-
dents. Its convenience. however, is
somewhat detracted by the lack of
a private place in which a student
can carry on his conversation.

At present, the TV room is often
ysed, but this is not always a good
arrangement because it interferes
with those who want to watch TV.

What is needed are soundproof
phone booths. Two regular booths
could easily fit in the space where
the open telephone slots now are.

Sign Of Times

We noticed the other day where
President Eisenhower had received a
check for $369.60 for not growing
wheat on fourteen acres. His 1956
“soil bank” check was $1,540 for tak-
ing thirty-two acres out of corn.

It is interesting to compare this
with President Herbert Hoover who
has served for years in the govern-
ment without accepting one cent.

It must be a sign of our times.

An Editorial by Abraham Lincoln

(February 12 is Lincotn’s birthday. Inf a ume when government gets brager and bigger,
when pressure. groups and minority groups seek. special privileges. and when individuals and
communities look for federal assistance, these words by Abraham Lincoln have a special signifi:

cance.)

You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.

You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.

You cannot help the small men by tearing down the big men.

You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.
You cannot further the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred.

You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.

You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.
You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and

should do for themselves.

SCHEDULED FOR ‘58?

Students:Pro And Con On Preferential Bidding

By ANDY BLAKE

The Interfraternity Couneil is
eurrently considering a proposed
system of “Preferential Bid-
ding”. for Rash Weck of 1958.

Because the fraternity
system is such a vital part
of life on the Davidson Cam-
pus, a change in the bidding
system is, of course, a mat-
ter of great interest to the

Student Bedy, and more

particularly to the fraterni-

ty men.

As proposed, the system in-
eludes a maximum number of
pledges. a list of rushees from
each fraternity, and a list of
preferred fraternities from each
rushee. For example, suppose
the quota is set at seventeen.
Each fraternity lists its first
seventeen choices, in no _ par-
ticular order, and then lists al-
ternates in the order of prefer-

ence. Each rushee lists in order
of preference the fraternities to
which he will accept bids. Next,
an impartial group studies the

lists, and decides which fraterni-.

ties receive which rushees.

We present here a representa-
tive cross section of student
opinion on this proposed change.

Ross Smyth: I am in favor of
the principle of the preferential
bidding system, but I am not
sure that the plan will work
well when first instituted here.
1 believe, however, that the plan
of preferential bidding can be
made acceptable to the fraterni-
ty system at Davidson.

Charley Drummond: I am op-
posed to the system because I
feel it should be a function of
the fraternity to regulate its
own size. It seems a violation of
the fraternity idea to impose
limitations on the size of the
pledge class.

Pete Andrews: I feel that the
present size of the average fra-
ternity is too large. to capture
the true fraternity. spirit, and
that the new system may be the
solution to this problem.

Roy Gilbert: | am in favor of
the present system because the
preferential bidding system is
too idealistic and impersonal.
The happiness of the rushee
might be sacrificed .to control
the sizes of the various fraterni-
ties, and it would be extremely
difficult for the fraternities to
list rushees in any order of
preference.

Tenney Dean: I think that the:

new system would strengthen
the small fraternities, and put
our fraternity system on a more
even basis.

Stuart Nickles: I am in favor
of preferential bidding. It
should eliminate a number of
the rush week headaches, and

must take two steps: one, she
must increase her production
and exports: two, she must limit
her rapid wage increases:

Britain’s economic system.
built up through the nineteenth
and éarly twentieth centuries,
is such that she cannot live
without foreign trade. She has
a highly diversified industry and
must seek markets all over the
world, opening up new ones
as old ones are blocked up by
the Iron Curtain or the indus-
trialization of newer countries.

Britain must sell her goods
and services abroad to buy food
and essential raw materials. The
United States, however, is a
continental Power with im-
mense resources. The foreign
trade of the United States, great
as it is in total, is but a small
part of her industrial activity.
* The need for markets is one
of the major problems that Mr.
Macmillan discussed with Presi-
dent Eisenhower. What Britain
wants from the United States
is not loans. but a market for
her products. It seems that
everything Britain designs to
sell to the American consumer
is immediately put under a high
tariff once its popularity is seen
in America.

One can see this in the Eng-
lish Fords and English Bicycles.
As soon as_ these products
showed that they would sell,
-American business interests put
pressure on the government to
impose a high tariff on these
products so that we might pro-
fitably produce them for our-
selves. Even though we under-
stand that the British need more
markets in the United States,
it seems unlikely that the Unit-
ed States is going to lower its
tariff appreciably.

WITH IT:

distribute the freshmen more
‘evenly among the different fra-
ternities.

Willy Thompson: Any fra-
ternity system will foster ar-
bitrarily set associations. No
one jis so idealistic as to see it
otherwise. We need to recog:
nize, however, that fraternities
strike a personal note of cold
reality, and they often burt the
development of some people
just as much as_ they help
others. Many personalities are
profundly set by certain trau-
matic events of rush week. I
sincerely believe that if any
semblance of good in our

fraternities is to be maintained.
then preferential bidding must
be exercised -

ON CAMPUS

John Trask: Preferential bid-
ding. means limiting the fra-
ternities thus killing the over.
crowding vroblem. The new sys-
tem will make more boys avail-
able to small fraternities, and
help larger fraternities by al-
lowing more selection of
pledges.

The interviews point out the
definite assets of the proposed
system, and also problems which
must be overcome before the
system could realize its greatest
potential value. They also make
clear that the Student Body is
thinking positively about what
system would be best for the
fraternities and the College.
This is a firm step in the right
direction.

In Doubt? Quit!

By CHARLES G. HELMS

(Ed. Note: We regret to announce that Phil Lewis, for-
mer author of this column, has been forced to retire from his
post, due mostly to a recent campus publication which re-
vealed what hé did “when in doubt.” Deciding that we had
better “ioin em,” we asked Charles Helms to take over the
column. Charley, doubtless because of the higher pay and in-
crease in prestige, graciously consented to change his al-
legiance, and go to work for the DAVIDSONIAN.)

Phil Lewis finally decided what to do “when in doubt”

—he quit.

Slates Clean

Exams are over and our professors are admonishing us
to keep our slates clean during the new semester: It’s
still first semester for one unfortunate (none other than
the editor of “The Poor Man’s Play Boy’), however. He
has gotten an extension on one of his courses and will
have to spend the first month of the new semester to
complete it. The wages of procrastination . . .

COFFEE BREAK

From Riches

To Rags

By BOB JONES

The approaching meeting of
the Board of Trustees brings to
mind again their regrettable de-
cision to increase the student
enrollment.

All who are concerned
with education are mindful
of the enormous increase in
college enrollments that is
anticipated in the immedi-
ate future. Facilities of
American colleges must be
expanded greatly to handle
the predicted one hundred
per cent increase by 1970.
Certainly the Davidson Roard

of Trustees was deeply im-
pressed with the facts and fig-
ures of this tidat wave of col-
lege students and the corre-
sponding need of providing the
adequate facilities. One assumes
that this was the motivating fac-
tor in their decision.

But there is much more to
the situation which would give
Pause, and ultimately lead to
the conclusion that the action
was based only on the most su-
perficial of reasons.

For Davidson to maintain
its numerical proportion of

nical schools in this crisis
is an impossibility. 1 would
require financial means far

beyond the college’s re-

sources, But in reality there

is no reason for Davidson to
maintain this quantitetive

Proportion when it is on the

very verge of increasing its

qualitative advantage.

Davidson can make a genuine
contribution to education by tak-
ing the lead in raising its stand-
ards and providing a first-class
liberal education. There is noth-
ing to warrant the opinion
that even the present standard
could be maintained with an
enrollment of 1000.

The crying need in edu-
cation today is not so much
for mass college education,
8s for genuinely intelligent
gradustes who possess a8
solidly grounded body of
knowledge and a mind that
can use this information
creatively and discriminat-
ingly.

There is not a men’s college
in the South that can boast of
graduates consistently possess-
ing these qualities. Davidson, it
would seem, is going to pass up
the opportunity of making such
a witness in education in favor
of a quick and superficial analy-
sis of the educational crisis.

How regrettable it is that a
church school forfeits such a
marvelous opportunity in favor
of following the lead of the
country’s secular colleges and
universities.
