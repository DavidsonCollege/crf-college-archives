They’re speaking for themselves and
not for the district.

‘And bear in mind that there are a
lot of people who didn’t sign the ad. I
don’t want anyone to draw the
conclusion that all my former col-
leagues on the faculty are against
me.”

McKelway said that he was very
pleased with the large number of
faculty who did sign the petition.

‘Consider how difficult it is for
50 percent of any group of people who
are willing to subscribe to a rather
detailed list of charges against a
candidate, I think the petition was a
success.’

He cited four main reasons as to
why some faculty did not sign.

“First we have some faculty mem-
bers who are Republicans and app-
rove of Martin’s legislative policies.

“Then a number of faculty mem-
bers have a close personal relationship
with Martin and his family. Some of
these disapprove of his conduct in
Congress, but they don’t feel that
they can publicly attack him.

‘‘Also a few professors do not
believe that it is proper for a faculty
member to make such a public
statement because someone who
might disagree could take a less than
positive view of the college.

‘Finally we did not approach all
faculty members.I would bet that
there were eight to ten more people
who could have signed had they been
contacted.”

Martin said that he was surprised
by a couple of names on the petition.

“You have to regret it when some of
your friends join in this sort of thing
but they are entitled to their own
opinions. I guess it kind of transcends
friendship,’’ he said.

The Charlotte Observer endorsed

McKelway characterized the en-
dorsement as ‘‘one of the most con-
fusing and disappointing editorials
I’ve ever seen in the Observer.”’

He said that he could have under-
stood the Observer not endorsing
Goodman because he has not been
successful in crystallizing the issues
and his stance on the issues, but he
felt that the newspaper should not
have endorsed either candidate:

“The Charlotte Observer is general-
ly a rather thoughtful and liberal
minded newspaper. It’s incredible
that it can endorse a Congressman
with one of the worst voting records
in Washington,” he said.

McKelway cited several nonparti-
san organization such as Common
Cause and the League of Women
Voters, which rate the voting records

The Candidate

of members of Congress. Most such
organizations, according to McKel-
way, give Martin a very low rating.

“About the only groups that give
him a high rating are groups like
American Manufacturing Association
and several defense organizations,’’he
said.

Martin explained that he had’ the
responsibility to hold the line on
spending.

“TI would like to be able to vote for
every well meaning bill that comes

budget deficit. The people who signed
that petition would like to pretend it’s
:not inflationary, but it is.

“T believe it’s irresponsible to pour
billions of dollars into programs.
These people want these programs for
two reasons. One, they’re against me
and two, they want to see the
government spend more money.

‘*Most people in the district are
tired of the government spending
their money,” he said.

In response to the question of
Martin’s representing the views of the
ninth district, Epes said, ‘‘I’d say
that he votes the people’s opinions...
but that doesn’t always produce wise
votes.”

McKelway added, “The fact that
the ninth district, which is mainly the
Charlotte metropolitan area, tolerates
Martin’s voting record means that we
are one of the most backward and

-tnorally dull districts around.

“I would have to say that in this
respect the ninth disrict is more mat-
erialistic and interested in economic
gain than any other area.

‘“‘We have problems actually get-
ting candidates to run because they
won’t give up their lucrative law
practices or businesses,’’ he said.

Martin pointed out that the adver-
tisement represented mostly a differ-
ence of opinion on the part of the
Davidson professors.

“This is a fairly conservative
district and that group of faculty is
fairly liberal,’’ he said.

Martin also was distressed by the
fact that the ad misrepresented his
position in respect to Richard Nixon.

“The part of the petition that
claims I obstructed the investigation
of Nixon is misleading.

“I voted for the investigation by
the House Judiciary Committee. I
voted to give that committee sub-

and morally dul

The professors
authorize was an unlimited budget for
the committee. And all this was fairly
early, too,’”’ he added.

“T think it’s a rather poor compari-
son for Congress that we Republicans
voted for the investigation of Nixon
but that we can’t get the Democrats
to do the same investigating into their
own misuse of Congressional funds,”’
he said. |

McKelway ‘blamed the ninth dist-
rict’s conservative tone on the reli-
gious, educational, and professional
leaders in the district.

“T don’t think churches and educa-
tional institutions have done a very
good job of educating the people on
where their interests lie.

“So the businessmen, doctors and
the wealthy vote for the man who vote
in their interests and Martin’s record
is certainly for them.

Chemistry Professor Ralph Gable,
who signed the petition, characterized
Martin’s voting record in the follow-
ing manner.

“‘Money needs for the people he
questions, but military money needs
he doesn’t give a second thought to.”

Gable said that he’s known Martin
for seventeen years but he would
‘“‘rather have someone else as my
Congressman.”

“If enough people become con-
cerned there will be a change in the
political climate and then maybe
someone can challenge Martin and

Martin this year for the first time. along, but we’re running a $50 billion __ poena_ powers. The only thing I did "” McKelway concluded.
