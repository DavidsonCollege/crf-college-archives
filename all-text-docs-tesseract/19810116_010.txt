IMAC

By THE BRICK BROTHERS and THE DOUGHBOYS

IMACis ill thie week like most of the campus. But we have
had a lot of action that has thus far gone unreported.

The league's two best teams have gone through the first part

of the season with records unscathed. Fido, headed by ‘Lob

Bapple and Stork, has done‘away with a bunch of mediocre. .

opponents. Cool Breeze with Gifford and James McLain had a
close call with We're Pathetic, being taken to overtime by this
“group with Mike, Hill, and Nick doing things.

_ The Unknowns and the Sorensen Sequoias are way worse than
anyone thought; ‘Joby’s old, Minor’s fat, Sorensen's slow, and
Dillard likes Dean, Smith. Hence, both teams are awful. Except
for True Grits there are no other good teams. The PIKA brigade
headed by Krieg, ‘Whitesides ‘atid a host of other PIKA’s and
SAE’s have crushed every non-descript opponent they've faced.

The.Old Men are bad and still play like children despite losing

_ Biedenbach, Bzdelik, and Kochan to the recent scourge of VD.
Vince and Whitmire are good for the Delts.

Other neat people include John Siman, Howard Cosell, Jeff
Frank, Giscard D’Estaing, and Ho Chi Minh.

Here’s our Top Ten.

Willingham said that he
would like alumni participation
to reflect more accurately “‘the
kind of school we've got and the
kind of alumni we've got.”’

In a table of combined alumni
contributions to athletic clubs

and endowment programs at.

colleges and. universities in the
United States, compiled for the
1978-1979 fiscal year by the
Council for Financial Aid to Ed-
ucation, Davidson was listed at
28.5 percent participation.

Williams reached 61.1 per-
cent, Amherst was listed at 54.0
percent, and Kenyon attained
49.5 percent. Davidson was
86th in alumni participation in a
list ranking private colleges and
universities.

Willingham would like to ex-
tend the student phonathon
another week this year to help
reach the 20 percent increase
goal.

He said that the phonathon
‘helped more in terms of partic-
ipation than in total dollars,”
but stressed the importance of
increased participation, saying,
“I think that what we're into is
an educational building pro-
cess.”

Willingham also plans to per-

Alumni -

sonalize requests for contribut-
ions. “The more personal the

hood of response,” he said. He -

plans to have class chairmen
form committees to telephone

alumni in their classes.

The Living Endowment may
begin approaching alumni on
the basis of geographical distri-

. bution, as well as through their

classes, according to Willing-

Alumni contributions comp-

rise about half of the Living

Endowment. The rest of the
Endowment comes from contri-
butions form students’ parents,
friends of the college, corpora-
tions, and foundations.

Willingham added, ‘‘I am
deeply grateful to all of the
leaders, student:and alumni,
and all of the individuals who
contributed to the Living En- .
dowment. "

(Continued from page 1)
The revised proposals still

include a requirement that
every student take one course in

non-Westérn studies. They also
still specify that only ‘‘basic
courses’’—courses which pro-
vide a broad, systematic intro-
duction to the particular disci-
pline— may satisfy area require-
ments.

The faculty will discuss the.
EPC proposals further at a
special meeting to be called by
the executive committee.

“If the faculty approves the
revised proposals, the new re-
quirements will: go into effect
with the freshman class enter-
ing September 1982.
