Political science professor Tom Kazee will
be leaving Davidson to as-
sume the position of dean
of the college and profes-
sor of political science at
the University of the South
in Sewanee, Tennessee.
His duties at Sewanee will
begin on July 1, and Kazee

the Davidson in Washing-
ton program ends on July
24.

As dean of the col-
lege, Kazee’s position will
be analogous to
Davidson’ s dean of faculty.
Kazee explained that while
his emphasis has stayed
primarily on teaching at
Davidson, he will work
more with administrative
duties at Sewanee. He en-
joyed the idea of “the chal-
lenge professionally and —
personally of helping to
shape their curriculum.”

1981 and has served as the chair of the political
science department since 1989. He won the Hunter-

On Thursday, March 1 1th, Dr. Elijah Ander-

900 Room of the College Union. Dr. Janet Shan-

lies. As our economy moves to a high-tech global
economy, many low-skilled, high-paying jobs are

African-Americans, who used to depend on facto-
ries, cannot make a successful adjustment to this
transition. CEOs of companies rarely consider the
inner city workers and are more concerned with
making a profit. Dr. Anderson asked students,
“What do you do in a situation like that?” He
suggested that more emphasis should be placed on

Taking advantage of the opportunity to inter-

African-American students. Later he had lunch
with local clergy and community leaders. In the
afternoon, Dr. Anderson talked with students in
