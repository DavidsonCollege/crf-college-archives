Gatto’s Charlotte Barons rule minor league

By BRUCE BALESTIER

As owner of the Charlotte
Barons’ football team,
Davidson football coach Vic
Gatto has a lot to say about the
team that has taken the Minor
League Football System
(MLFS) by storm, beating up
on the other ten teams in the
league en route to an unde-
feated record in their first year
of existence.

The Barons have trailed just
twice the entire season, and

even then only by seven point .

deficits which were quickly
erased.
The Barons have, with their

dominance of the league, be-

come the toast of Charlotte,
drawing very respectable
crowds of between five and six
thousand fans and attracting
sponsors. There is even talk
now that ESPN will televise the
MLFS championship game, in
which the Barons seem a sure
participant.

Yet, while the success of the
team and the way the city of
Charlotte has embraced. that
success are surely positive fac-
tors, it is Gatto’s opinion that
they will be of little importance
tothe NFL Expansion Commit-
tee in making their decision.

“It certainly shows that the
market is a good one, but the
NFL team is based on NFL
politics more than itisanything
about Charlotte,” said Gatto.

“The way the NFL has al-
waysexpanded hasbeen based
on political and not demo-
graphic information. The NFL
will sell out [tickets], it’s really
not a problem; the problem is
who has the political firepower
to get the team.”

As far as the MLFS or a
league like it serving as a farm
system for the NFL, that seems
unlikely. The NFL. now. has
what Gatto terms a “free ride”
in terms of a minor league, in
that big time college football
acts asa pipeline of talent to the
pros. i

There is, nonetheless, NFL

interest out there, and that has
to do with NCAA Proposition

48, which bans from competi-
tion freshmen who fail to meet .

certain academic standards.

“It doesn’t do. anybody any
good, except the football fans,
for the kid to play four years at

a college, not get adegree, goto |

an NFL camp, and get cut,”
Gatto said.

“It’s really disastrous fora lot
of kids," he added. "If colleges
ever get serious about just tak-
ing in students, which is un-

likely, [in teams like the Bar- -

ons] you would have a whole
set of guys who are athletically
able. This league, or any
league, could offer a good op-
portunity for them to keep
Payne and get trained at a

Gatto’s acquisition of the
Barons proved to be a blessing

when Davidson made the deci-.

sion to drop its football team
from Division! AA to Division
Ill status. Larry Stewart, the
offensive coordinator for the

Wildcats a yearago, was out of

a job after that drop in status,
He is now general manager

~}- Boston University

and head coach of the Barons
and in the words of Gatto,
“controls it all.”

While no other team in their
league has hired even one full-
time coach, the Barons have
hired two, both former
Davidson coaches who had
found themselves jobless after
Davidson’s move to Division
Ill.

According to Gatto, “The
Barons just happened ata point
when we had astaff problem. I
was firing people who had
families because of what
Davidson had done and it was
justa nice chance for me to save
a situation that I didn’t want to
have happen.”

In addition, Stanley Monk,
formerly a star running back at

Duke and presently the run-
ning back coach at Davidson,
and Dave Davis, a graduate of
Baylor and the Wildcats’ re-
ceiver coach, play for the Bar-
ons. —

The MLFS has experienced
financial success across the
board. But while the survival of
the league seems certain, the
question of whether the Barons
will be in it after this season is
very much up in the air.

No other team has done the
work that Charlotte has done.
There are no other full time
coaches in the league, and no
other franchise approaches the
Barons in the seriousness. of
their endeavor.

Stewart has signed many
players cut in last year’s NFL

‘couple of weeks, signed a
number of recent NFL cuts.

The Barons have flourished
with near-NFL caliber players,
and have played at a level to
which none of the other fran-
chises have even come close.

“We're unhappy with the

fact that nobody is competing
with us,” said Stewart.

“You obviously want to be
undefeated, but the way it’s
been hasn’t been the way we
had hoped. We’re really ques-
tioning whether we're going to
do it again.”

Gatto has been approached
by a number of teams about
joining a more competitive
league. One such team in
Scranton, Pennsylvania has

camps and has, in the last .

won 40 straight games.

Soit may bea change of scen-
ery for the red-hot Charlotte
Barons next season, and hope-
fully a step up in competition
from the MLFS.

“It was supposed to be a
league for NFL pretenders, and
unfortunately the pretense is
monumental for the people
we're playing,” said Gatto.

“The guys we have have a
vague shotat something, butat
least they’re playing at that
level," he added.

"When you see Stanley Monk
run the football, it looks like a
Sunday afternoon; he’s that
good. But you don’t feel that
way when you see the other
team’s running back. It’s not
the same thing.”
