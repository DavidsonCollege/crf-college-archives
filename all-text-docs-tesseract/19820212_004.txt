Students Protest
Nerve Gas
Production

As a response to a staff editorial in
the Charlotte Observer, a group of stu-
dents are planning to organize a protest
against recent Reagan administration
decisions to increase the production of
nerve gas. Students will hold signs at
the basketball game vs, South-Carolina

David Resnick hopes that at least 100
students will join the protest, and that it
will draw wide attention since the game
