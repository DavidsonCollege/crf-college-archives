two lectures

Buck, a professor of math-
ematics at the University
of Wisconsin, gave the two
lectures under the auspices

of the Piedmont Visiting
Scholars Program.

In . handling ‘the topic
“Newton Revisited’ Buck

used what he termed. ‘‘ab

actually did."
As a mathematician Buck

, traced the , deyelopmem of

Newtonian physics through
the mathematical tools
available to Newton at the
time. In discussing the his-
torical development in which
Newton took part, Buck cit-
ed Kepler's laws of motion
of planets which he termed
as “empirical statements of
fact.”’

The fundamental point of
Buck's. presentation lay in
che role of mathematics in
explaining the world.
