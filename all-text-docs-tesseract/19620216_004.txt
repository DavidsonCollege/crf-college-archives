NEW NEIGHBOR just up the road finds an appropriate location for saving souls right next

Sister Ann: ‘They Come
To Pray, Burn Candles’

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

_ The entertainment mecca “just up the road” on NC 115 has a new and somewhat
ironical addition. On the Davidson side of Hattie’s stands a small square house with
a Sign in front proclaiming “Spiritual Healer, Sister Ann.”

basketball game, a crucial contest for two Southern Con-
ference teams. The atmosphere in the referees’ dressing
room, in the basement of Johnston Gym, gave no clue to
the importance of this game as the two men dressed
slowly.

to sey anything more than
whet every spectator of the
geme was saying to his negih-
bor: “Halberstadt was ter-
tific, but the ‘Cats just geve
the bali away too much to
win.”

Perhaps the men’s retuctance
to answer further was due to
the presence of their boss, B. W.
Hackney, Supervisor of Officials
for the Southern Conference.

However, “Bunn” Hackney, a
former athlete at UNC and a
referee himself for twenty-five
years, had a few things to say
about how a man gets on his list
of referees and what is expected
of those men in their work.

Hackney was vehement a-

bout Lou Bello end Charley
Eckman, both lone-time fav-
orites of the fans due to the
vehemence with which they
perform their duties. “They
hurt officiating and the con-
ference. Fans pay to see play-
ers tike Jarman end Halber-
stadt, not the referees. ff
their calls are good, the way
they go about meking them is
certainly not.

Joking and reminiscing about
persons and incidents of their
trade were Jack Fleck, from
Morgantown, West Virginia, and
Whitey Kindall, from Greenville,
S. S.

A referee is on the road a
‘lot, they said, because he
doesn’t just work in one con-
ference, but might go from
Pennsylvania to South Caro-
lina to work games on suc-
cessive nights. Officiating
might be his vocation, or it
might be an avocation. Most
referees were athletes them-
selves, and have graduated in-
to coaching or some other as-
pect of sports with refereeing
as their paying “hobby.”

A referee must work his way
up to the “big leagues” just as
any athlete. He starts in the
high sdhools and community
leagues, and if is good enough,
goes up the ladder.

As the pair was getting ready
to leave the dressing room, it
was asked if the ultra-partisan
Davidson crowd plus the smal!
Johnston Gym gave the refs any
qualms. Replied Kindall, “If the
crowd bothers you at all, at any
time, then you shouldn’t be out
there.”

After the game, packing to

leave, the men were reluctant ball this year.

Sister Ann made it appar-
ent that she was neither a
gypsy nor a fortune teller.
“They must have a license.
And they charge three, four,
five dollars.” She had neither
license nor fees. “I do this for
e hobby. My husband lives for
me. You can’t make a living
from this.”

If not telling fortunes, what

in her high-heeled shoes and
house. dress doing? Because she
enjoyed listening to people's
problems, they came to her,
sometimes just to peay, some-
times to have Sister Ann prey

But there seemed to be an

incongruity between the iliumin-
ated sign outside and the ‘atti-
tude inside. Why the gaily color-
ed Indian’s head? Sister Ann,
born in Georgia, had _ strong
traces of Indian blood. Besides,
she believed in the Indians, in
the legends of prayer and heal-
ing. “It rhymes with spiritual
healer, you know what I mean?”

But the sign says spiritual
healer; what does that mean?
Sister Ann thought that each
turned to God in his own way,
even though he would not like
to admit it. Then sometimes it
is not enough to turn to God;
one needs to share problems
with a sympathetic ear. This
is Sister Ann’‘s hobby.

Didn’t she believe in the
Catholic Church, which also
serves aS a kind of “listener”
with its practice of confession.
“I love the Church. I go when-
ever I can. It is fine to have
time to go once a week.”

Those who expected from Sis-
ter Ann the mystic rites of prog-
nostication or the antics of
demonic exorcism would be dis-
appointed.

It would probably take more
than this to increase the traffic
up Route 115. The only thing
for certain was that it was very

hot for February and Hattie’s

was almost next door.

Vagabonds Sponsor
One-Act Play Series

The Vagabonds are sponsoring a series of one-act
plays in the Workshop productions on Feb. 21, March 7,
14, and 21. The most promising of these presentations
will be entered in the district contest of the Carolina
Dramatics Association which will be held here on March

24.

At last year’s district contest
in Charlotte, three of the five
plays entered were selected to
go to the State Festival at Chap-
el Hill. Of these, all received
very favorable comment.

Any group or individual inter-
ested in working on a play or
any part of the production
should contact Prof. J. R. Gross.
Groups—fraternities, orgatiza-
tions, or classes—intereeted in
doing a play must select the
play, a director and the cast.

The Vagabonds, on the other
hand, will finance the ventures.
In addition, the drama _ group
will assist with lighting and the
set, with coordinating activities,
and with securing publicity.
Prof. Gross, when interviewed
by THE DAVIDSONIAN, stated
that a group’s lack of an exper-
ieneed director should not keep
it from participating. ©

As long as interest is display-
ed, Gross said that he is confi-
dent that experienced aid can be
fiucnished to the groups. Asked
about groups that have already
committed themselves, the Eng-
lish professor replied that the
Independents, the honorary dra-
ma fraternity—Alpha Psi, one
freshmen class, and Prof. Sned-
en’s drama class had agreed to
participate. Also, three -frater-
nities have indicated an interest.

Gross added: “I certainly
think this is an excellent plan
if we can get it operating. A lot
of students have indicated that
they are interested in drama
and this is a fine opportunity
for them.”

Rivers. With a flush of galety,
Rivers responded in a stentorian
voice: “Oht Yes! Your little
sister just got married, didn’t
she.”

“No, sir. I hope not,” replied
the student.

“Oh! That must be somebody
else,” responded the unabashed
statesman.

As students came away from
the discussion, they could feel
comforted by Rivers’ words:
‘?’m an American. I don’t care
anything about Russia. I favor
winning friends any way you
ean.”

Rock ‘n’ Roll Opens
Festivities Tonight

underway tonight with a rock ’n
roll dance at 9 p.m. featuring
the Clovers, Buster Brown, John-
ny Jenkins, and Otis Redding
and the Pinetoppers.

Also tonight the Artists Series
will present the Netherlands
Chamber Choir at 8:15 in Cham-
bers auditorium. The Highway-
men are scheduled to perform
tomorrow afternoon.

IFC president Bob Waugh be-
lieves that the rock ‘roll
groups and the Highwaymen
should provide a good contrast
and he said that the IFC is ex-
pecting a good turnout at both
the dance and the concert.

Waugh is particularly inter-
ested in the general reaction to
the rock ‘roll attractions and
would appreciate the opinions
of Davidson students. .

Mrs. J. B. Moore, director of
dormitories, said that this is
the most poorly attended dance
weekend in years. She noted
that she has no waiting list this
week for rooms in Belk and
Richardson, and that some
rooms are still empty.

_She estimated that student at-
tendance was about 20 per cent
off the usual average, and at-
tributed this lack of participa-
tion in part to the fact that
many students do not care for
the rock 'n roll type dance week-
end.

The current rash of flu cases
is another contributing factor.

He is not a big man. And
he is a quiet man. But small,
quiet men have a way of
walking tall and loudly a-
cross the earth.

For four men. somewhere in
the United States today, Sgt.
Jerry K. Crump is the biggest
man they know. For without him
on the morning of Sept. 7, 1951,
they would not be alive today.

Perhaps everyone here at Dav-
idson knows the quiet man in
the ROTC armory with the bulge
of tobacco in his cheek. Per-
haps everyone knows that he
has won the Congressional
Medal of Honor, the highest a-
ward for bravery that can be
given.

The events took place on
the night of Sept. 6 and the
morning of Sept. 7, 1951, near
Chorwon, Korea. Crump was
8 corporal then, and a squad
leader. He does not know why
he did what he did when the
enemy attacked the hill on
which his platoon had estab-
lished a listening post. If he
does not know, no one ever
will. But he acted instinctively
throughout the atteck; and
when it was over, Crump had
one foot in the grave and a
hand clutching the Medal of
Honor.

The Chinese sent a battalion
in the night to wipe out the
platoon. Crump exposed himself
repeatedly in going from fox-
hole to foxhole to check on his
squad. In the process, he found
time to deliver effective fire
into. the enemy ranks with a
BAR. Upon seeing two of the
enemy about to capture a ma-
chine gun Crump charged and
killed both with his bayonet.
“I could have shot them, I
guess,” he said. “But I just
charged.”

The platoon was not able to
stop the Chinese from over-
running the. position. It retreat-
ed about two-hundred yards up
the hill. But Crump remained in
a foxhole with three of his
wounded squad members and a
medic. “I didn’t think about re-
treating,” he said. “The cnly
thing 1 thought about was patch-
ing up those wounded boys. We
had been through a lot together,
before.”

MEDAL OF HONOR WINNER Jerry K. Crump has been
assigned a new tour of duty in South Vietnam. He leaves David-

son five years of service here.

Crump could have remained
quiet after the enemy had
_ passed by the foxhole without
noticing anyone in it. But he
fired on them from the reer
and caused such confusion
that the Americans were able
to make them retreat in panic.

A Chinese soldier tossed a
grenade in the hole on his re-
treat. Crump did not have time
to think. He admitted he could
probably have jumped from the
foxhole and not haye gotten a
scratch; however, he threw him-
self on the grenade—part of his
stomach and hip are now gone.
He spent seven months in a hos-

pital. But four other men in the
hole with him are alive today,
and Crump has the Medal of
Honor because he didn't jump.

Crump in no way exploits his
winning of the medal. There
have been honors, to be sure.
He personally received his
medal from former President
Harry S. Truman. In 1958 he,
along with seven other Medal of
Honor winners, helped then-
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
place a flag over the tombs of
the Korean and World War II
Unknown Soldiers. The entire
staff of the ROTC Dept. is proud
to be serving with him and are
hot ashamed to admit it.
