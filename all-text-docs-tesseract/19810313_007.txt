Frankhouser named All-Conference

Women netters see bright side of defeat

The women’s basketball team
had a rebuilding year, according
to Coach Dee Mayes. The team
will look to improve on its 3-18
record next year. The relatively
young starting squad, com-
posed of four sophomores and
one senior, showed improve-
ment as the season progressed.

Sophomore starter Mike
Frankhouser demonstrated the
team’s promise with her election
to the North Carolina Division
III All-Conference First Team.
Frankhouser had a superb sea-
son, scoring an average of 18
points per game and pulling
down 11 rebounds.

“It was a long year as far as
winning games,” Senior Cap-
tain Kirby Owen said, ‘‘but the
people involved in the basket-

ball program made it a great
experience, and point to con-
tinued strength and chances for
improvement next year.” .

The team will lose two valu-
able players next year. Owen,
who is graduating, has demon-
strated strong leadership in her
three years on the team. Her
quickness was responsible for
numerous key plays.

Foreign exchange student
Harriet Holshuijsen will be
returning to her native Holland
next year. Her contributions
came in the latter half of the
season as she gained experience
and skills in a sport which was
new to her.

Sophomore starters Frank-
houser, Jeanne Womack, Mitzi
Short, and Carol Heppner
should all be ready for strong
play next year. Short and

Heppner were agressive on the
defensive court this season and
spurred the offense with solid
outside shooting. Womack and
Frankhouser, the team’s lead-
ing scorers, were also strong in
rebounding and inside play.

Good play under the basket
was provided by sophomore
Kathy Morell. Other returning
players include freshmen Deb-
bie Hayes, Nancy Bondurant,
and Laura Hills, sophomore
Amy Crittenburger, and junior
Barbara Hoopes.

Coach Mayes, who will be
returning for her second year as
head coach, said this core grop ,
along with some strong pros-

spective students, make her

optimistic about next year’s
season.

Wrestlers dramatically improve record to .500

The Davidson wrestlers
wrapped up their season with a
36-13 win over Washington and
Lee, a 60-0 massacre of Barber
Scotia, and losses to East
Carolina and Campbell College
(24-18). The Cats’ final record
was 8-8, a great improvement
over last year’s 2-8 record.

Among the team’s bright
spots this year were Junior
Scott Smith (134 pounds) who
finished the season at 20-7, and
Freshman John Breidenstine
(150 pounds) who sported a
record of 20-11-1. Sophomore
Van Wagner (142 pounds) at
10-7 and Senior Captain Dave
Nichols (190 pounds) at 11-11
for the season also contributed
outstanding performances.

The post-season Southern
Conference Tournament was a
bit of a disappointment to the
team. Davidson’s overall per-
formance was greatly hindered
by injuries that plagued the
wrestlers through much off the
séason and the tournament. At

the championships, Eric Hill
(118 pounds), Todd Kimsey
(126 pounds), Chris Tiernan
(158 pounds), Tate Nichols (177
pounds), Dave Nichols (190
pounds), and Svend Pedersen
(Heavyweight) were eliminated
with two losses each. Van
Wagner, John Breidenstine,
and Bob Kear (167 pounds)
finished the tournament with
1-2 records.

Coach Bob Estock commen-
ted that the Davison wrestlers
were ‘‘not as physical” as the
other teams in the conference
and that more weight training
was needed in the off-season.

Estock hopes that more in-
tense training will prevent in-
juries. Estock especially cited
Van Wagner, who lost by a
single point in the Southern
Conference semi-final consola-
tion, as one who must ‘‘over-
come his injuries.’’ According
to Estock, Wagner is an ‘‘excel-
lent wrestler’ and will be a
strong contender for a Southern

Conference championship next °

year.

Swimmers smash records

By JIM CROWE
Sports Editor:

The Wildcat swimmers, un-
der the direction of Coach Pat
Miller, concluded one of their
strongest seasons ever, finish-
ing 11-2 in dual meets.

Davidson finished fourth of
seven teams in the Southern

Conference Championships held.

in Charleston, South Carolina.

The season was an outstand-
ing one for individual perform-
ers as well. Seven of the
swimmers— Warren Beck, Mike
Schremmer, Craig Allen, Craig
Finger, Bill Crone, John Ed-
wards, and Frank Bright — were
named to the All-Conference
team.

The team busted 11 of 19
school records during the sea-
son. Warren Beck broke records
in six events: the 200 free, the
100 free, the 200 backstroke,
the 100 backstroke, and two
team relays.

Mike Schremmer broke four
records, including the mile or
1650 free, in which he shattered

‘ his own previous mark by 24
seconds.

Craig Finger set a new mark.

in the 100 butterfly as did Keith
Riddle in the 100 breast stroke.
Frank Bright set a new school

record in one meter diving. -

Bright’s new school record ‘and
all-conference selection are ex-
ceptional since Davidson does
not provide diving facilities.

Rifle tear posts.
18-7 performance

The Wildcat Rifle team
posted an outstanding season
under the direction of Coach
Ransom Cooper and Captain
Pat Stuart. This year was
Cooper’s last at Davidson. He
has been reassigned to Fort Lee
in Virginia, and later to a post
in Augsburg, Germany.

The team finished 18-7 in .
dual match competition. David- —

son finished fourth in the Sou-

thern Conference meet at Lex-'

ington, Va.

Junior Craig Rice was named
to the all-conference team as
one of the top ten finishers.

Another big loss to the team
was Scott Smith. Because of
stretched ligaments in his
knees, Smith was not able to
wrestle in the tournament.

Bob Kear and Dave Nichols
were forced to default three
matches because of injuries.

The team will lose seniors
Dave Nichols and Svend Peder-
sen this year. Tim Brotherton,
(158 pounds) who finished the
season at 6-12, will spend his
junior year abroad.

Twelve wrestlers, however,
will return. With this year’s
greatly improved dual season
record, it looks as though
Davidson wrestling will defin-
itely be a force to be reckoned
with next year. In Coach
Estock’s words, ‘‘the future
looks bright.”

Owen’s intense moral support.

While most Davidson stu-
dents were enjoying their vaca-
tions, the members of the
winter track team were com-
peting in the Southern Confer-
ence indoor track meet at
V.M.1. A second-place finish by
Lance Sisco in the 60 meter high
hurdles and a fifth-place finish
in the 800 meter by Dave Stosur
(201.1 seconds) helped the
Wildcats to 15 points and the
best Davidson showing in re-

cent years.

The Wildcats finished one
point out of sixth place. Senior
Co-Captain Dick Jones cited the
intensive workouts under Coach
Frank and greater team depth
as a key to the positive results.

With the success of the
winter season and the added
depth of new team members,
the Wildcats are looking for-
ward to a winning spring track
season which opens against
Washington and Lee on Satur-
day.
