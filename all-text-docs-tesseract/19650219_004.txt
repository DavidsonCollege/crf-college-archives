Davidsonian Stalf Writer

Davidson College Rescue Squad has recently been organ-
effort of 10 members of the college maintenance staff, and
director of the physical plant, in accordance with the admin-

istration’s policy of maintaining modern safety equipment.

Having completed an inten-

sive 36-hour course in fire
evacuation procedure and first
aid, the 10-man squad is now
available for emergency assist-
ance on campus or wherever it
is needed. As a result of spe-
cial instruction in heart mas-
sage, the squad members are
also trained to render first aid
in case of heart attack.

HOME SAFE!

Oscar Gant, a former Da-
vidson fire chief and presently
maintenance supervisor leads
the squad through weekly drills
in an effort to familiarize his
men with the new apparatus and
to practice under simulated res-
cue conditions. The college has
Spent approximately $2,000 in
buying a 60-ft. ladder, two air
packs, two life belts, ore re-
suscitator, and eight safety suits
composed of helmets, boots,
jackets, and trousers.

At first the biggest problem
avas the Jack of storage space
for the equipment. However, the
shop crew solved this by build-
ing an 8-ft. storage box mounted
on rollers. In case of an emer-
gency, the safety apparatus can
be rolled by one man. from the
, shop platform onto a pickup
truck. Should the truck develop
motor trouble, the box could
be moved to another truck with-
out any delay.

Another problem centered
around a way to alert squad

. members during off-hour emer-

gencies. To solve this, Gant has
adopted the “chain call sys-
tem.” Once alerted by the night
watchman, Gant telephones the
next man in the chain, and so
on until each man is contacted.

Although still working for per-
fection, the squad is a profes-
sional rescue team with nine of
its 10 members having diplomas
in safety procedure. Captain Jim
Jameson of the Charlotte Fire
Department taught them in spe-
cial night classes running from
November to January.

While Gant. Junior Barker,
and Carl Sherrill are regular
volunteer firemen. the other
seven are not. Representing the
departments of engineering and
grounds, these seven are Philip
Caldwell. R u b e.n McIntosh.
Philip Cashion, Luther Honey
eutt, Lloyd Honeycutt. Larry
Titsworth, and George Morrow.

In appreciation of their hard
work Meetze commented.
‘These men deserve a lot of

credit. They've learned the best
first aid I've ever seen.”

Meetze hastened to add how-
ever that the school facilities
are safe. “We are not alarmed
with our present conditions;
however, we always try to find
better methods if possible. We
conduct siren tests everyday at
1 p. m., but as yet we do not
have a_ set evacuation pro-
cedure."

Meetze is working with stu-
dent groups to seek the best

NEW FACILITIES DEVELOPED !

Duke Money Distributed

By JIM MORAWETZ
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Duke Endowment has
given an $80,000 specific-
purpose grant to the col-
lege, bringing to $274,000
the Duke allocations to Da-
vidson this year, the college
has announced..

The allocations will be as

. follows: $10,000 for.improvement

of the. physics lab, $20,000 for
intramural and personal athletic
facilities, $5,000 for the college's
self-study program. $20,000 for
the establishment of a physi-

“ology lab and biology museum,

$15,000 for continuation in 1965-
6 of the Junior Year Abroad
program, and $10,000 for fur-
ther development of the Inter-
departmental Humanities Pro-
gram.

Previous grants from the Duke
Endowment for the current
school year were $114,500 for
faculty recognition, encourage-
ment, salary improvements and
the establishment of a writer-
artist in residence program and
$80,000 for the improvement of
the library.

The allotment for the physics
lab is a matching fund which
“| equals a NSF grant received last
spring. Since then new equip-
ment has been procured to up-
date the lab, especially in the
field of electro-demonstration
and special projects.

The $20,000 given to the ath-
letic department will be used to

all oe new additions, according to
athletic director Tom Scott, will
include four hard tennis courts
and surface facilities in hand-
ball and basketball.

The funds given for the estab-
lishment of a physiology lab and
biology museum have to a large
degree already been used. The
new 800 sq. ft. physiology lab, al-
ready constructed, has more
than doubled the former facilf-
ties, according to Dr. William
Lammers, associate professor of
biology,

Also, there are now special

spaces for work with radioactive

isotopes and with special instru-
ments.

The biology museum, con-
structed last fall in the top floor
of the Dana Building, gives ade-
quate space for the storage and

noted for her “Readings from
Robert Frost’ and variations on
the topic of “The Meaning of
Culture.”

Miss Frost has the singular
ability to make all literature,
but particularly poetry, an ad-
venture in thought and feeling.
Throughout her life, from her
childhood on her father's famous

cent voyage from Gloucester,
Mass. to Scandinavia in a small
sailing boat.

Her special interest in chil-
dren shows itself in her two
books of children's short stories

a book of poems, Says Prescott.

more books, ! Mate Licorice, an-

which, for the past forty or fifty
years has been kept in the attic
of the Martin Science Building.
According to Dr. Elmer Brown,
the museum will contain verte-
brate and invertebrate materials
which will be useful in class
lectures.

The $15,000 for the Junior-
Year Abroad program is to be
used to obtain another professor
to replace the one needed to take
charge of the program. Students
will, for the most part, still be
expected to meet their expenses
with their tuition money.

The $10.000 for the Humanities
Department will be used to a)-
low professors to prepare for,
improve, and evaluate the pro-
gram during ‘the summer.

The two other grants, $80,000
for the library and $114,500 for
the faculty have already been
put into use. The library budget
itself, in the words of President
D. Grier Martin, has ‘‘more
than doubled’’ in recent years,
and this grant will further aid
in Davidson's efforts to ‘‘ac-
quire the outstanding library.
which it should have.”’

The faculty allotment, as de.

scribed by Dean of Faculty.

Frontis Johnston, will be used
more for “renewal and refresh-
ment” than for research. Ap-
proximately a dozen faculty
members to be chosen in a few
weeks, will be selected for
grants this summer.

Johnston also stated that al-
though no choice has yet been
made for an artist or writer in
residence, some decision is ex-
pected to be made in the near
future.

Davidson is one of four schools
receiving continuous aid from
the endowment, the other
schools being Duke, Johnson C.
