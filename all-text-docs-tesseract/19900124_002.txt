Admissions to lose
Parker to CA school

By CLAY WRIGHT

Assistant Dean of Admissions Savan-
dar Parker has decided to leave his
position at Davidson in order to pursue
further career options as the Director of
Student Affirmative Action at San Jose
State University in California. His resig-
nation takes effect January 31.

Parker explained that he loves
Davidson's size and students, but his
current position offers him little possi-
bility for career advancement or the
responsibility and resources which will
be available to him at San Jose State.
Although visibly excited about the
move, Parker deeply regrets having to
leave the students he met and be-
friended, many of whom were his early
recruits.

Due to his sincere concern and per-
sonal, easy-going manner, Parker is
extremely popular with those students
who have had the chance to meet him.
Freshman Anthony Foxx described
Parker as “genuinely interested in the
future of every student.” Jana Player
said she has been impressed by his abil-
ity to “keep up relations with the stu-
dents that are here” as opposed to just
those he is recruiting.

Parker has been a member of the col-
lege’s admissions team since 1988. He
was responsible for the mid-Atlantic re-
gion in Davidson’s admissions pro-
gram and also sought to add to the di-
versity of the campus by actively re-
cruiting minority students. No replace-

Savander Parker has been a friend to

students since 1988. He is leaving Jan. 31.

(Phi Delt will stay )
despite low

numbers
By GARY WHEELER
Despite the fact that only a few
freshmen self-selected Phi Delta
Theta this winter, President Andy
Hunt told The Davidsonian re-
cently that he does not expect
Davidson’s chapter to fold next
year. Hunt admits that Phi Delt’s
junior class is “virtually nonexist-
ent” (2 members), but also says
that the fraternity’s total member-
ship will not change drastically.
Thirteen people self-selected
Phi Delta Theta this year, 7 fresh-
men and 6 sophomores. Hunt es-
timates that between 12 and 15
seniors will graduate this year,
leaving the fraternity with about

30 members for next year.

Baku taken by Soviet troops; new Panama
head to visit Washington.

and CAROLINE WILSON
SOVIET UNION: Violence
continued in the Soviet repub-
lic of Azerbaijan, a site of ethnic
unrest between Christian
Armenians and the Moslem
Azerbaijani majority. On Sat-
urday Soviet troops broke
through blockades and shot at
Azerbaijani protesters. This
was the first time the Kremlin
has used deadly force against
Soviet citizens since last April,
when troops opened fire on
protesters in Tbilisi, Georgia.

The Kremlin is now up
against not only the Azerbaijan
Popular Front, but also an
Armenian paramilitary group.
The violent’ crackdown has
resulted in criticism of the So-
viet government by its own
people and the governments of
Turkey and Iran.

On Monday ABC news re-
ported that Soviet troops had
lined up along the Iranian bor-
der to control the supposed
transfer of arms to Azerbaijani
nationalists.

BULGARIA: Communists

- announced that they will hold
a major party congress on Janu-
ary 30th as a result of recent
protests and demands by labor
movements for a more open
economy.

ROMANIA: The government
cancelled the referendum pre-
viously scheduled for January
28 that would have outlawed
the Communist party. Officials
also announced cuts might be
made in the flow of electricity
to some large industries.

POLAND: Last week 35,000
coal miners went on strike to
protest new government im-
posed wage controls. The con-
trols are part of Poland’s new
experiment in a “crash” eco-
nomic plan and are expected to
check current inflation at 500
percent. Polish families can
expect to have their total in-
come reduced by 20 percent
before improvements are seen
in the economy.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA: The
United States has given “most
favored nation status” to
Czechoslovakia. This means
now that Czechoslovakian
goods can be sold in the US.
and marks the first step in its
move to participate ina market
economy.

EAST GERMANY: Criminal
investigations into protesters
who raided the capital’s secret
police headquarters last week
were opened. East German
leaders said that the nation’s

revolution must remain peace-
ful. :

In West Germany leaders
said that a freely-elected East
German government must join
them in declaring German
unity as their goal and indi-
cated that treaties now being
negotiated between the two
countries were intended to
prepare for national unity.

Egon Krenz, the Communist
responsible for the opening of
the Berlin Wall, was expelled
from the country on Monday.

PANAMA: Guillermo Endara,
Panama’s new president, an-
nounced that he will travel to
Washington “as soon as pos-
sible” to ask for at least $240
millionin economic aid. Part of
this money will help rebuild
homes in the poverty-stricken

neighborhood of El Chorillo |

that were destroyed in the U.S.
invasion of Panama. Endara
has not spoken with President
Bush since December 20th, the
first evening of the invasion
which overthrew General
Manuel Noriega.

Endara faces severe employ-

ment problems and fears thata —
guerrilla insurgency will de-.

velop if solutions are not of-
fered soon. With this fear,
Endara has proposed that the
Fuerza Publica (police force) be

~

increased from 1,000 to 10,000
members. The Fuerza is mostly
composed of former Noriega
soldiers.

SOUTH AFRICA: At the
three-day meeting of the Afri-
can National Congress, Walter
Sisulu urged the congress to
“sound out” the government
on its eagerness to negotiate
with the them. The ANC’s

“Harare Declaration” requests
the release of Nelson Mandela,
former leader of the congress;
the lifting of a ban on the ANC
and other political opposition
groups and the withdrawal of

security forces from black
South African townships. It
also outlines stipulations for
constitutional reform in South
Africa.

President Mugabe of Zim-
babwe claims to have received
USS. backing for the document.
The interference of an outside
force could stall negotiations
and the release of Mandela.

CHINA: Five hundred sev-
enty-three people who were
jailed during last year’s free-
dom demonstrations were re-
leased last week. Thousands
remain in prison.

OOPS! we apologize for leaving Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon’s 21 eek off the article last week.
