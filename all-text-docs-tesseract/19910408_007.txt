“THE DAVIDSONIAN' OPINIONS

Beyond Birk nstock

We Apologize .

Well, it is good to be back,
_isn’tit? We’re in the home stretch
of the academic season here at
Davidson (around here, they don’t
stop serving beer in the seventh)
and we’re happy to be able to con-
tinue to bring you biting humor
and insightful commentary once
again. It turns out that our HU-
MOR (youknow, those things that
are supposed to elicit a HUMOR-
ous response because they are
meant to be FUNNY) last week
was less insightful than inciting (to
riot, that is).

Our comment concerning
UNLV: was not appreciated by
several of our colleagues on cam-
pus due to simple misinterpreta-
tion. In case there are any blank
places in your memory of spring
break, and the period immediately
before, we predicted that Carolina
or Pitt would win the NCAA tour-
nament. (So much for our psychic
ability to call basketball games.)
~~ Now forthe controversial part;
we put in parentheses.:a compari-
son of the UNLV team toa bunch
of Neanderthals. Neanderthals, in
case you were wondering, are a
raceless group of paleolithic men,

not widely known for their intelli--

gence. (Yeah, weknow the anthro-
pological arguments for the crania
size of the paleolithic man.)

So when we said that UNLV
dragged its knuckles onto the court,
we were acknowledging the wide-

spread media perception that the
UNLV players were less intelli-
gent than your average household
appliance. Call it intel- :

than by his own initia-

According to

for blacks to better
themselves have in-

compromise for your wounded sen-
sibilities.

We find the fact that we have
received more response to the as-
pects of our column dealing with

humor than those dealing with le- °

gitimate political issues upsetting.

For example, when we wrote
anarticle concerning Jakob Holdt’s
exhibit “American Pictures”, we
received no response. This sur-
prised us. Here was a legitimate
political problem for which we pro-
vided acontroversial solution. An

CLIMATE AND SEA LEVEL: ©
OUR HABITS AND THE OCEAN

Many of us spent last week on
the oceanside shores, soaking up
the sun and playing, swimming,
and surfing in the ocean. Kew of us
probably thought much about the
waters in which we were wading.
But our Oceans are some of our
most vital resources, and there is
much concern around the world
that the same abuse of our terres-
trial resources is occurring against
our rivers, seas, and oceans.

Over vacation, I spoke to Paul
Gayes, Director of the Center for
Marine and Wetland Studies at the
University of South Carolina-
Coastal; about his thoughts about
the state of our oceans. —

Gayes is participating in a
world-wide study to try to deter-
mine how sea level changes on the
coasts affect the climate. Gayes is
also .working to determine the
impact of hurricane Hugo on the
Southeastern section of the Atlan-

tic Coastline, Gayes is trying to,
identify where the sea level has
beenin the past, how quickly ithas
moved, and to compare different
sea levels throughout the world to
determine if some regular change
pattern is a global phenomenon.
- Gayes’ group drills pipes into
the. sediment in order to examine
the series of deposits that have
been left over time. He looks at
microfossil vegetation to pick out
where the sea level was at certain
periods in time. By looking at the
different organisms in the sedi-
ment, he can determine the ap-

proximate sea level through his
knowledge of the normal habita-
tion levels of the known organ-

isms.
~-Gayes also uses techniques
such as radiocarbon and the sound

‘method. The latter method uses a

“subbottom profiler” to send a
pulse of pressure with sound to
penetrate the earth under the ocean.
The pulse then bounces back up,
constructing crossections of the
earth.

Gayes has found that 4,000-

years ago, the sea level at Myrtle
Beach was higher than other places
on the east coast, and it has been
rising since. Even amere 20 miles
‘away, the earth’s surface has been
moving ‘differentially to the areaat
Myrtle Beach. Oceanographers
think that this movement in sea
level is climatically related, but

they are still uncertain of the direct
link between climate and changing
sea levels. Gayes is studying the
effects of storms of 4,000 years
ago, as wellas Hugo, inattempting
to answer this question.

One of the difficulties in this
study have to do with intersecting
theories, such as that of the green-
house effect. On the one hand,
Gayes stated that we are at a peak
of a warm interglacial period, and
our global temperatures are fairly
on par with estimates of global
temperatures of other peak inter-
glacial periods of thousands of
years ago. On the other hand,
Gayes assessed the coastal and es-
tuary waters as becoming worse,
for petroleum and hydrogen prod-
ucts are staying in the sediment,

and the entire food chain from - |

mononucleus organisms to our-
selves has been disturbed.

According to Gayes, there is _

no technical solution to the envi-
ronmental hazards created by in-
dustry. There. are too many factors
which play arole when itcomes to
cleaning up our oceans. The best
solution he finds is efficiency. We

‘canno longerafford to be so waste-

ful,and weneed tocutdownonour
use of resources. The ocean works
innatural cycles, of which we know
very little about. We need to resta-
bilize these cycles by ending the
abuse of our wastefulness against
our waters. Efficiency can put time
on our side, but otherwise, time
will work against us.

suggests that racial vic-
timization is not our real problem.
If conditions have worsened for
most of us as racism has receded,
then much of the problem must be
of our own making.” -Where was
the outrage? Where was any re-
sponse?

We can only assume that ei-
ther everyone agreed with us or
else no. one cared enough to re-
spond. What we are basically
saying is that we resent having
something entirely apolitical tumed
into something political. If you
disagree with us politically, we
can respect your opinion. We do
not and cannot respect those who

judge us without attempting to
understand what we say.

Shelby Steele also has some-
thing to say about these phenom-
ena: “I think those who provoke
this sort of awkwardness are oper-
ating out of a black identity that
obliges them to badger white
people about race almost on prin-
ciple . . . one sees evidence of this
in the near happiness with which
certain black leaders recount the
horror of Howard Beach and other
recent (and I think over-celebrated)
instances of racial tension . . . As
one is saddened by these tragic
events, one is also repelled at the
way some black leaders--agitated
to near hysteria by the scent of vic-
tim-power inherent in them--leap
forward to exploit them as evi-
dence of black innocence and white
guilt.”

Admittedly, the UNLV com-
ment was not a great intellectual
statement, but it wasn "t racist ei-
ther.

Our colleagues demanded an
apology for nothing more than our
writing a sentence that they misin-
terpreted. Well, we are sorry that
they misinterpreted our intent, but
we are not sorry for writing the
sentence.
