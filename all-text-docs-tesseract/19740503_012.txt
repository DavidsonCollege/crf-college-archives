looked to Paul. He ran in the
hurdles, the sprints, long
jump, truple jump and on oc-
casion high jump. Paul was
the third highest scorer for
the season.

Lautensack was the most
consistent scorer in the dis-
tances. He ran all four dis-
tance races sometime during
sonal best time in the mile,
steeple chase, a 9:58.

Along with Lautensack was
Coty Pinckney, Jessie Smith,
Buck Farrow, Rick Deal,
Fred Borch and Ricky Bell.
All of these people will be back
next season, so the distance
team will again be strong.

Greg Love and Bob Trumbo

other countries around the
world. Before describing each
news item, Gregory asked to
see how many people in the
audience had ever heard
anything about it. “How many
of you have ever heard of the
Bank Secrecy Act?’’ The'

paltry response of a few
people raising their hands
each time attested to the
unreasonable obscurity he

was trying to expose.

Although very little that
Gregory said was pleasing or
hopeful, it was all enlightening
because what he said was
seemingly backed by a num-
ber of factual sources. Citing
these sources (articles, books,
lectures, and reports by
‘researchers,’ aided by
Gregory), he stated that the
a is controlling this coun-

“The CIA and the DIA,
that’s the Defense Intelligence
Agency, are vieing for control
of this country. The CIA is sid-
ing with Eastern money and
the DIA with the Pentagon,”
said Gregory.

“The whole reason all you
hear about today is the
Watergate cover-up is
because the CIA doesn’t want
you to know what’s really
going down in this country.
Why do you think that you
don’t ever hear about what

He said that Cronkite per-
sonally deleted .Iohnson’s
statement from his newscast.
“But wie CIA caut get me
because I tell the whole
truth,’ Gregory said.

His talk was spiced with his
own feelings and beliefs, but
the message we, ua «very
American citizen should find
out what’s going on for him-
self. He complimentec the
young audience and called
them ‘‘a breath of fresh air’.

Gregory charged the

audience to look at the country
and to straighten it out. ‘The
faith and destiny of the coun-
try depends on you young
people, not your old, lazy ,

. degenerate parents who are

afraid.”

Gregory ended his talk by
suggesting a reading list that

will help to alert readers to the.

sicknesses in the country that
he had been describing. The
address to write for this list is
