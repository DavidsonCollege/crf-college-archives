Part I: Historical Review

Coeducation has been under
serious discussion at Davidson
College since the autumn of
1968, when the President’s Stu-
dy Commission on Coeducation
began meeting. That Commis-
sion, made up of members of
the Faculty, the student body,
and the Board of Trustees of
Davidson Collége, presented its
report in May, 1969.

The Commission had cunduct-
ed an extensive survey of fac-
ulty, student, and alumni opin-
ion, investigated the experience
of other colleges with coeduca-
tion, analyzed the cos‘s which
Davidson would incur in becom-
ing coeducational, and evaluat-
ed the arguments for and
against coeducation at that time
for Davidson College.

The Commission found that
coeducation was desirable from
an educational point of view in
that it provided an opportunity
fo prepare students more ade-
quately for the world in which
they would live after their un-
dergraduate days were over.

It also found that Davidson
would be more likely to main-
tain or to enhance the quality
of its educational program if
the college became coeducation-
al, since it would be in a better
position to attract the ablest
students.

“To increase the attractive-
ness of Davidson as an educa-
tional institution, to make pos-
sible the continued selection
of highly qualified students, to
enhance present programs and
to develop and populate new
programs,” the Commission re-
commended that Davidson be-
come coeducational ‘‘at the earl-
iest appropriate time.”

its study of the economic as-
pects of coeducation convinced
the Commission that this move
was well within the financial
capabilities and fund raising po-
tential of the college.

The Commission recommend-
ed that the enrollment eventu-
ally become 1500, composed of
900 men and 600 women students.

During the year 1969, the
question of coeducation for Dav-
idson College was further in-
vestigated by an outside con-
sulting agency, the Academy
for Educational Development.

After talking to faculty mem-
bers, students, and administra-
tors, and evaluating Davidson's
current standing and its future
prospects, the AED recommend-
ed that the college become co-
educational at the earliest pos-
sible date.

The AED felt that coeduca-
tion would not only provide an
important stimulus to the in-
fellectua! and cultural life of
the college, but that without it
Davidson would be less able to
compete with prestigious in-
stitutions for the best students.

The figures projected for Dav-
idson’s enrollment were in line
with those already recommend-
ed by the Study Commission.

While the AED investigation
was taking place, arrangements
were being discussed whereby
Davidson will admit students
on a one-year, exchange basis

with seven colleges (including
four women’s colleges) in Vir-
ginia: Hampden-Sydney College,
Hollins College, Mary Baldwin
College, Randolph-Macon Col-
lege, Randolph-Macon Woman's
College, Sweet Briar College,
and Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

On December 5, 1969, the Fac-
ulty of Davidson College voted
to admit up to 30 women stu-
dents for the 1970-71 academic
year under the Eight College
Student Exchange Program.

A similary exchange arrange-
ment was subsequently made
involving Davidson and Queens
College in Charlotte. Ten wo-
men students attended Davidson
College iri 1970-71, and twelve
in 1971-72 under these exchange
arrangements.

The Board of Trustees of Dav-
idson College responded to the
recommendations of the Study
Commission and AED reports
on February 3-4, 1970, by ex-
pressing its willingness ‘‘to con-
sider the admission of women

Students as degree candidates
at such time as this is judged
by the Board to be economically
and educationally feasible.”

They also directed that inter-
institutional arrangements with
Queens College be explored as
one possible avenue toward this
objective.

A futher step towards coedu-
cation was taken by the Board
in May, 1971, whem it made the
decision that the wife or daugh-
ter of a member of the fac-
ulty or staff at Davidson, or
the wife of a student at Dav-
tdson, could enroll as a regular
or special student in Davidson.

Several women students, in-
cluding one candidate for a de-
gree, have enrolled in the col-
lege under this arrangement.

Thus, by the autumn of 1971,
the subject of coeducation had
been investigated, some practi-
cal steps towards coeducation
had been taken, and the aca-
demic community bad had some
experience with coeducation at
Davidson on a limited scale.

DAVIDSON GENTLEWOMEN?
Things look brighter for coeds on campus next year.

Part II: Investigation, Polls, Surveys

On September 17, 1971, Dr.
John M. Bevan, Vice President
for Academic Affairs at David-
son College, acting on the re-
quest of President Spencer, ap-
pointed a subcommittee of the
Educational Policy Committee
to investigate the experience of
colleges comparable to David-
son with coeducation and to ex-
amine the feasibility of further
steps towards coeducation at
Davidson.

The purpose of the investiga-
tion was to assist the Educa-
tional Policy Committee in for-
mulating recommendations to
the faculty on the future of co-
education at this college.

The members of the Educa-
tiomal Policy Committee ap-
pointed to the Subcommittee on
Coeducation were Professors W.
Brown Patterson, Chairman,
Charles L. Cornwell, David C.
Grant, and Charles E. Ratliff.
and Mr. Joseph E. Turner,
Class of 1972.

During the autumn of 1971
the members of the subcommit-
fee got in touch with officials at
eight formerly all-men’s col-
leges and universities, roughly
comparable to Davidson in size
and academic program, which
had taken steps in the last few
years to become coeducational.

The eight are Colgate Univer-
sity, Dartmouth College, Frank-
lin and Marshall College, Ham-
ilton College, Kenyon College,
Princeton University, the Uni-
versity of the South (Sewanee),
and Williams College.

We received fairly detailed
information from these colleges
on the process by which they
reached a decision in favor of
coeducation and the steps by
which they planned to imple-
ment that decision.

This information is in the
form of letters, summaries of
telephone conversations, and
published reports and resolu-

tions.

To the information which the
subcommittee compiled we add-
ed information from several of
the same colleges and univer-
sities gathered in the spring of
1971 by Dr. Jay H. Ostwalt, Di-
rector of Instructional Develop-
ment, on the request of Dr.
Bevan.

Dr. Ostwalt assisted the sub-
committee in analyzing the in-
formation gathered from these
sources.

We found that, with a single
exception, these colleges were
becoming coeducational by ex-
panding their total enrollment
without substantially reducing
the number of men students.

Projected increases in enroll-
ment ranged from 25% to 100%
The projected ratios of men to
women students ranged from
4:1 to 1.3:1.

All, therefore, expected to
educate women in considerable
numbers in the next few years.

students was also suitable for
women.

The financial costs of becom-
ing coeducational by expending
the enrollment were found to be
almost exactly the same as
those involved in any expan-
sion — whether by men or wo-
men. Capital funds had to be
raised (by gifts or loans) for
additional housing and dining
facilities.

But except for the two col-
leges which have been involved
in building coordinate colleges
for women, there seems to have
been relatively little new build-
ing other than housing and din-
ing facilities connected with co-
education.

Loans from government sour-
ces at low nates of interest seem
to be used most often to finance
these additions. Two colleges
are attempting to avoid any
substantial building program by
utilizing their present facilities
on a year-round basis.

which could be used to ascertain
the opinions of the alumni and
other groups on this subject.

The questionnaire which was
devised attempted to gauge not
only the respondent’s opinion on
the desirability of coeducation
at Davidson, but his reaction to
a number of possible plans by
which coeducation could’ be
realized.

't was eventually decided to
poll four groups: faculty, ad-
ministrative staff, students, and
alumni. The same questionnaire
was used for all groups, in or-
der that the results could be
compared more easily.

Questionnaires were sent to
all members of the faculty, all
members of the administrative
staff, all students living on cam-
pus, and all alumni.

We received questionnaires
back from 83.5% of the faculty,
52.7% of the administrative
staff, 60.3°¢ of the students, and
27.1% of the alumni.

“The educational policy Committee has come to the conclusion, after considering

the subject since Septe

r, 1971, that it

is not only desirable and feasible

for Davidson College to become coeducational, but that it is imperative for the col-

lege to do so at the earliest possible time.”

-EPC Coeducation Report.

Every college, without excep-
tion, felt that the move to co-
education had been the right
one.

General satisfaction was ex-
pressed with the quality of the
women students, as compared
with the men students.

Half the colleges felt that
women had had a positive effect
on the intellectual and cultural
life of the campus; at the other
half there was apparently no
discernible change.

None of the colleges had al-
tered the curriculum  signifi-
cently for the admission of wo-
men, the commonly-expressed
view being that the liberal arts
curriculum § suitable for men

As for operating expenses, the
colleges seem to have found
that the increased expenditures
required for an enlarged stu-
dent body are met by the in-
creased revenues which come
in through tuition and fees.

The colleges, again with the
exception of those with coordi-
nate colleges, have found it un-
necessary to add many ad-
ministrative personnel specifi-
cally for women students. Co-
education was, on the whole.
proving to be a practical ven-
ture.

The subcommittee was also
asked at an early stage in its
deliberations to help formulate
a questionnaire on coeducation

There was strong. support
from all groups for increasing
the number of women students
at Davidson. In favor were
68.6% of the faculty, 75.9% of
the administrative staff, 90.7%
of the students, and 59.3% of
the alumni.

Among the alumni the strong-
est support came from the
classes which have graduated
in the past eleven years, but
there were more supporters
than opponents of coeducation
in each group of classes for
which separate tabulations were
made: ‘00-'25, ‘26-'39, ‘40-49,
*50-'59, and ‘60-71.

Again, as to the most advis-
