Students Gather at Gym Popular Davidson Wiseman Victim of

Three Hundred Listen to Play by
Play Detail of Wofford Game

Almost three hundred students assembled
in the gym Saturday evening to hear the re-
turns of the Davidson-Wofford game ‘play |
by play. A large blackboard was placed at
the end of the gym, and each play was mark-
ed off by Jim Kuykendal. An attempt was
made to lease a wire to get the returns, but
this could not be done becaiise all the wires
were needed after the
Florida.

Ernest Milton telephoned the returns from
the grandstand at Spartanburg, and they
were wired here over a direct line to Harllee |
Branch, who relayed them from the station |
to Bill Story, at the gym. An admission
charge of 25 cents was made. A little more
‘than enough to cover the expenses of 'phon-
ing the returns was taken in. This is being
held over and will be used to help defray the |
expenses of the V. M. I. game, the returns
of which will be sent back in the same way.

From the roof of the grandstand, Ernest
Milton had a good view of the game, and was
thus able to give a good detailed report to

In the reign of James, the son of Pinkney, |

Darkness blacker than the onyx of many |
hose, deeper in hue than the face of many

| janitors, descended upon the land wherein

the Davidsonites dwell. Two sons of deceit,
yea, two followers after Belial, dug a pit and
made a snare wherein to catch those who

| were righteously blind, who were unlearned |
in the wiles of the beast called Life.

they and under his outer vestments bound |
they a rope with a great binding, verily, |
bonds placed they about his body. Powder,

placed they upon his countenance, that those

nigh unto the portals of Death.
In the darkness of the nether- regions of |

loose cord did they tie about his throat, that
the ignorant and the stupid might believe that |
he had followed the example of Judas; the

that neither scientists nor theologians would |
