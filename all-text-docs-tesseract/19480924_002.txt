achievements. Premature judgments make
this class look extra good among other

Davidson freshman classes. We can expect
big things of the class‘of 752.

In like manner, the class of ’52 can expect
great things of Davidson. They can expect
the same sort of education that
has for more than a hundred years now sent
out leaders in the fields of law, medicine,
business, and the ministry. They can, we sin-
cerely hope, expect the all ‘*per-
sonality education’’ that will -be even more
in evidence when the student body number
has settled back toward Six
hundred and fifty.

They can expect big things from David-
son athletics. Since the war, athletics have
been making progress. Davidson should
make some of its best football history in the
next four years. The class of ’52 will be
the first, most probably, to get the full bene-
fit of the new gymnasium.

Rushing Thru’ Rush Week

Rush week is gone

and well-nigh forgot-
ten. That is, until the thought of having to
go through the same gruelling round next
fall hits us between “he eyes. Then our
heads begin to swim in a sea of name tags,
stilted eourtesies, black balls and be-
wildered freshman Jooks until finally we
manage to divert our thoughts to more
pleasant channels. Do we ever stop to con-
sider whether anything can be done to make
rush week a more sensible undertaking ?

As it stands, the present rushing system
does have at least three distinct disadvan-
tages. First of all, most of the fraternities
do not know exactly what they are doing.

They are groping in the dark, so to speak.
In the second place, most of the rushees go
into rush week without much notion of what
is expected of them and with little
realization of the factors involved in the
choice they are expected to make. Last, but
not least, a great deal of necessary study is
neglected during that first week of school.

very

Could these advantages be overcome by
postponing rush week, putting it off, say, un-
til the beginning of the second semester?
And if such a postponement could solve the
aforementioned difficulties, would the pur-
poses of rush week be served as well?

To take the latter disadvantage first, we

this problem. Even if rush week were de-
layed long enough for freshmen to find out
what’s what on the campus and in frater-
nity court, and long enough for the frater-
nities to really get to know the rushees, the
problem will remain. If it were postponed,
the freshmen would have learned a little
about college assignments and would not be
quite so swamped by the loss of four days’
work, At_any rate, the rush week would al-
most have to be as long and as intensive as it
now is. And unless freshmen are to be meted
out to different fraternities by lots, some
study must be missed.

From the standpoint of the rushee, a
postponement would be beneficial. The aver-
age freshman comes to Davidson without
much knowledge of fraternities. What little

tion talk on fraternities and a rush week dur-
ing which he is constantly patted on the back,
hot-boxed and generally kept in the dark
about the fine merits and demerits of fra-
ternities, is not a sound basis for a wise
choice. Certainly it would be better for the
freshman to have time to make his own
evaluation of matters fraternal before being
rushed into anything, — :

The: fraternities are somewhat better off
than the rushees. They at least know what
they want. All they have to do is find it in
the clouded atmosphere of sleepless nights,
endless’ refreshments, countless introdue-
tions, jumping, jiving musie, ete., ete. What
should Ve merely the preliminaries of a good
rush week—making dates and getting ac-
quainted with the rushees—takes up most
of the time, and there is no time left for
actually matching the qualifications of the
rushee up against the aims and ideals of the
fraternity. :

In short, it’s a hazardous undertaking,
this early rush week. It is not fair to the
rushee, it does not do justice to the frater-
nities, nor is it in harmony with the David-
son tradition of intelligent logking before
you leap. Let’s all study the problem and
see if we can’t come up with a better solu-
tion.

Letter To The’Editor

To the editor:

It has come to my attention during the
past two years that some of the music at the
Davidson football games here and in Char-
lotte does not conform with the traditional
Davidson fighting spirit so“ well known to
friends and alumni of the college.

While my _ knowledge of musie is ex-
tremely limited, I do think it within my
ability to recognize the fact that ‘‘La, la, la,’’
and blowing bubbles are not an inspiration
to men physically struggling to uphold the
reputation of Davidson College upon the
fields of friendly strife.

I realize that the quantity of suitable
music may be limited, but I do think that
from somewhere within the list of inspiring,
forceful music, some tune more appropriate
to the football spirit could be found.

As a word of commendation, however, I
would like to say that the quality of. musie
of the Davidson Football Band surpasses
most of the similar type bands I have been
privileged to hear. Nevertheless; it is ex-
tremely difficulty for me, and I feel sure
this also applies to the football team, to be-
come emotionally inspired to the tune of
“Ta, la, la.’’ :

So therefore, may I take this opportu-
nity to suggest to Mr. Pfohl and to the
Music Department, that for the sake of more
spirit on the part’ of the spectators, and for
a greater and ‘more inspired ‘effort; on’ the
part of the football team, we do away with

ball games and concentrate on music more
in accordance with the indomitable Wild-
eat spirit.
Sincerely,
©

the past week with numerous fes-

our true appreciation to
Lrother Mitchell for arranging and
planning the house party held last
spring which, as we all know, was.
a great success and surely another
feather in Roberts’ K. A,

a vocabulary capable of expressing

possible for us to reveal the blow

plete account.

PI KAPPA ALPHA
After nearly a week of rushing,
PKA brothers have finally found
time to stop and. speak to each
other and renew old acquaintances.

seemed

press

Seen around the house this year
are several new faces, incuding
Jeff. Wood, Stiles’ Markey, Bill

Cook, Floyd Furr, and Bob Coble,
all pledges or brothers who have
been away from Davidson for a
year~ or’ so. Menibers of the new
pledge class are fast’ becoming ac-
quainted with each other and the
old brothers and _ pledges. The
pledge will begin their in.
struction period immediately.
With the football season here
a large part of the brothers who
are the roaming type, will take off

class

on the week-ends to attend the
games played away. from home,
and to attend other pressing busi-
ness. Brothers Gragg, Smith, War-
lick, and McElroy, expect to obtain
feminine companionship for the
State game just in case the weather
should suddenly turn cold, while
Brother Mills is taking a car full
of bashful, timid males, including
Brothers Huffaker, Cameron, Jack-
son, and Pledge Oterson. Other
brothers having dates in Raleigh
for this game are“hereby* issued a
sincere warning to be on the look-
out for this car full of bachelors
on the loose.

And now we will have a resume
of the summer activities for some
of the members of Pika. Brother
Denison spent a large part of ‘his
time trying to learn about the oc-

rcult habits of fish (with very little

luck); Brother Shumate. spent the
summer with his head buried in
books here’at Davidson, for fear
of having too much spare time to
get into devilnrent. The ticker tape

joy spent a great deal of time up
the river (the Catawba, that is)
in search of beautiful camping
spots. Brother Leonard had _ the
good fortune of becoming PiKA’S
lone «married student by taking in
marriage the beautiful: Miss Shirley
Parks of Statesville. They are liv-
ing in Statesville, and Taylor
commuting to+school each day.
Brother Mac Hart spent his sum-
mer at his home in Gainsville, Fla.,
the home of the University of
Florida, but he wasn’t studying
books. Instead he held a position
with a milk company. It wasn’t
much of a job, but you'd be sur-
prised how good one feels if he
gets up at 5 o'clock each morning
to deliver milk. Feeling that “a
little learning is a dangerous
thing,” several brothers sought to
increase their knowledge by attend-
ing summer’ school; among these
were brothers McNair, Bell and
Dockery, who report that there's
nothing like two sessions of sum-
mer school to rest one up after a
hard winter's studying. Brother
Warlick labored- in, a Statesville

vy By BOB HOLLISTER

This column, which will reap-
pear in each forthcoming issue cf
THE DAVIDSONIAN, is a
bright-eyed. Freshman this year.
Conceived by Macy Hart, editor in

the managing editors in turn) and
by the associate editors and editor
in chief. It can be concerned with,
and probably will, almost anything
—from the most outrages
of a noxious editorial

recent

frosh to

/policy. For the most part, however,

this column is to give Davidson
student a glimpse behind the scenes
of their college paper. ;
To start off the new year we
would like first of all to extend to
the class of ‘52 a big handfull of
laundry, we are sincerely glad-to
aroun,’
It doesn’t take long for a new class
to learn customs and

‘like for you wearers of the red to

learn is

right away that this is
your paper. The fellows who go
through the weekly routine of

gathering material—sorting it out,
typing it up, proof-reading it and
on and forth, ‘far into the
night, do it solely for you. Their
only reward is in the interest you
take in this paper, and in the man-
ner in which you show that interest
through your comments, letters to
the editor, features you may sub-
mit for publication, and general
campus discussions. The above ap-
plies, of to all Davidson
men withthe freshmen particularly
in mind, however.

As for you august upperclassmen,
we want to\urge you to keep the
Davidsonian a little more in mind
this year. If anybody can make
its weekly appearance something to
look forward to, you—and in the
final analysis only you—camdo so.

There's an old law of psychology,
or if there isn’t there ought_to be,
which holds that a person associat-
ing himself with an ideology or a
cause, actually becomes, in a sense,
part of that cause. The same prin-
ciple holds true here on the cam-
pus. The more men who link them-
selves to the activities, the interest
anu ‘aims of college ‘lifé, the more
real—the more vital—these things
will become. And in addition, the
personality and character of the
men thus identifying themgelves
will in like manner be immeasura-
bly enriched.

Such is the goal we, of the David-
sonian staff, have set for ourselves,
for this paper, and in every possible
way, we are able to assist in the
ultimate attainment of this aim, for
the Student Body and Davidson
College, x

The summer, it~ was” generally
agreed, had been profitable for all
the brothers, and for a couple it
had been a particularly important
one. Brother Earle Smith, Beta’s
ace athlete, had late in the summer,
entered into the blessed state of
matrimony. Earle and the former
Miss Jane Feltz of Wytheville, Va.,
informed the world that “Mr. and
and Mrs.” is the name. Best wishes
for much happiness go to Earle
and Jane. That big smile that

graduates of last year—in other
words, they’re going steady.

The strain ot a rigorous rush
week failed to dampen the ole Beta
spirit, and many of the brothers
showed up at Saturday night's feed
after the game with some of the
cutest “sweet young things” that
the visages of the college presidents
have gazed down upon in many
a day. The brothers unleased their
tremendous repertoire of songs, the
mood was sentimental, and before
time to say good-bye it was quite
evident that the good brothers had
not lost their skill in the manly
art of “snowing the women.”
