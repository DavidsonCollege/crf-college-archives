OPINIONS

MONDAY, MARCH 17, 1997

“Thave been drinking and driv-
ing for the past twenty years and
never gotten into an accident.” This
is something that I heard on the
Friday just before spring break (the
end of Alcohol Awareness Week)
not by a student, but by a professor.
AsI walked into class, the professor
was already recalling how insensi-
tive and ineffective the “Jaws of
Life Demonstration” on the previ-
ous Wednesday had been.

As a current member of the
Rescue Squad and Fire Department
back at home in New Jersey, and as
a participant in the demonstration

on Wednesday with the Davidson -

Fire Department of which I am also
a member, I felt a need to rebut the
argument of my professor.

Not only was I concerned that
he/she had not understood the pur-
pose of the demonstration, but I was
also greatly offended being that I
am an individual who volunteers to
be involved in organizations that
deal with tragic situations like auto
accidents.

It started off with Professor X
making the classic assertion of how
the whole scenario was insensitive

have malicious intent to reopen old

ing and driving.

The last
statement Pro-
fessor X made
was possibly
one of the most
irresponsible
and shocking
statements that
I have ever
heard. Profes-

driving and not
for other causes of auto accidents.

Professor X next questioned
the over-dramatization of the inci-
dent. He/she said that it was much
too excessive; we had two actual
students acting as victims who had
been ejected from the car and a
dummy in the back seat that we
extricated. For Professor X and
anyone who saw the scenario and
questions its dramatic qualities, I
can assure you (just as well as any

would like people to know that the

‘ scenario took about half of the time

that a real accident takes. Since it
was a pre-planned scenario, we had
taken the time in the days before-
hand to look over the car and decide
exactly what techniques and tactics
we were going to use. So in that
respect, Professor X is correct, it
wasn’t realistic because in a true
extrication call, it would have taken
much longer.

sor X clearly
said that he/she had drunk and then
driven on countless instances over
the past twenty years and had never
gotten into an accident. The point
that I believe he/she was trying to:
demonstrate was that some people
do drink and drive and are lucky
enough not to get involved in an
accident. I can neither deny nor
prove this fact, yet I was greatly
offended. In the course of Alcohol
Awareness Week, many people had

given of their time and efforts, many
voluntarily, to demonstrate possible
effects of alcohol to students and
faculty who haven’t had the oppor-
tunity to see them.

In no way am I saying that if
you have a beer and then drive, you
are going to be wrapped around a
telephone pole at two in the morn-
ing waiting for rescue personnel to
cut you out of the car, but I am
saying that a grave danger is posed
to those who choose to drink and
drive, or to ride with those who do.
Despite whatever intentions the pro-
fessor had, a comment such as the
one that he/she made was totally out
of order.

The purpose of this article isn’t
to point fingers or get people into
trouble, but to try and educate those
who didn’t get the point of Alcohol
Awareness Week the first time. I
can only hope that next time a little
more appreciation will be shown to
all of the individuals and organiza-
tions that contribute to Alcohol
Awareness Week and that teachers
like Professor X will exercise more
responsibility when deciding to
comment on sensitive issues such
as drinking and driving.

A senior White House staffer
strolls down a corridor from her
spacious office in the Old Execu-
tive Office Building to attend a
briefing. A foreign businessman
steps across her path, greets her
pleasantly, and offers her an enve-
lope. The staffer takes it, promis-
ing to mail it to the addressee the
next morning.

Anordinary transaction? Not
when the staffer is the First Lady's
Chief of Staff and the envelope
‘| contains a $50,000 contribution to
the Democratic National Commit-
tee (DNC). Under circumstances
similar to this hypothetical case,
Chinese businéssman Johnny
Chung gave Hillary Rodham
Clinton’s Chief of Staff, Maggie
Williams, a contribution to the
DNC in exchange for “face time”
with the president during his
weekly radio address.

The United States Criminal
Code states that “‘it shall be unlaw-
ful for any person to solicit or
receive any contribution. . . in any
room occupied in the discharge of
official duties.” The White House
claims that there was nothing ille-
gal about Ms. Williams’ action.
She did not technically receive the
contribution; she neither recorded
it nor cashed it nor stored it for
future processing. She only trans-
‘mitted it to its intended recipient
much like a trucking company
hauls freight.

The administration is right--

this. And the same conclusion

there was nothing illegal about ©

Reaching for a Higher Standard

could be reached about other mat-
ters recently in the headlines: over-
night stays in the Lincoln Bedroom
and coffees for large contributors,
the Vice President’ s soft-money so-
licitations from his White House
telephone, Johnny Chung’s more
than fifty White House visits since
1994, and improper contributions
returned under suspicious circum-
stances.

This is troubling, not for its
illegality but for its dangerous mix-
ing of official duties with private
political fundraising; in this case, a
DNC check handled by White
House staff exchanged for atten-
dance at an official address. These
revelations form a pattern showing
that the amenities and status that the
White House affords were used as a
part of broader partisan fundraising.
Our perspective in discussing these
issues should not be limited to ques-
tions of legality--just because some-
thing is legal does not make it ethi-
cal or even desirable.

During these fundraising cri-
ses, the president and others imme-
diately declared that “nothing ille-
gal was done.” Al Gore repeated
that no “controlling legal author-
ity” prevented him from using call
sheets to target donors to the DNC.
This lawyerly defense is hardly re-
assuring. One wishes that they could
defend their behavior by claiming
that they acted completely ethically
rather than just protesting that they
did nothing illegal. Unfortunately
they cannot. Expressions of regret
over recent fundraising activities or

a willingness to eliminate future
lapses were shamefully absent from
White House — statements.
Strangely, officials even seemed
proud of their behavior and saw no
problem in rewarding donors with
overnights or soliciting money in
official rooms.

Legality aside, there are seri-
ous problems of perception and
ethics here. The actions of execu-
tive branch officials should be held
to a higher standard than legality.
The administration should not con-
centrate on acting legally but on
eliminating activities that could
even possibly be construed as im-
proper or unethical.

Thisis notto suggest the White
House has a monopoly on unethi-
cal behavior and fundraising
abuses. Republicans have certainly
done similar things under different
circumstances. That is why the
Senate has decided to investigate
both congressional and White
House fundraising practices. The
Senate Government Affairs Com-
mittee will not only examine po-
tentially illegal conduct but also
that which is deemed to be “im-
proper.”

The Senate has recognized that
maintaining public trust in gov-
ernment requires officials to con-
duct themselves not just legally
but ethically and responsibly as
well. :

America needs assurance that
the White House is not routinely
being disgraced as a tool to reward
political contributors.

Race Relations

Last Saturday, I attended a
rather constructive forum about race
and differences on campus. These
forums are held to help people talk
about their differences and try to
learn more about why racial and
ethnic groups are so divided on cam-
pus.

The existence of such a forum
indicates that problems do exist be-
tween racial groups. Butitalso says
there is acommitted group of people
willing to improve them.

Race is never an easy topic to
discuss, and each group always has
valid points to defend actions they
see as wellintentioned or fair. After
the civil rights movement, the dis-
cussion has largely turned away
from one about injustice to how
different people can integrate better
overall.

The forum wrestled with the
big question of whether minorities
should incorporate themselves into
a predominantly white culture and
turn away from their roots or
whether whites should change more
to better accept people of different
races. We dealt with the issues of
scholarships, the court, and basic
race division on campus. These
discussions can go on forever. We
are all different people and will see
things differently. It is hard to say
if one perfect solution exists for the
problem. I doubt it does.

Still, I did come to a couple
conclusions about what people can
substantively do about race and dif-
ferences to begin working on prob-
lems,

Passivity and a quest for seépa-
ration should be rejected outright.
Honestly discussing race and trying
to learn about our differences is
incredibly worthy in itself.

Along with an eternal vigilance

to make sure racism does not raise

its ugly head, that is all people who
are concerned about race relations
need to do, and it is the least they
should be required to do.

Whether or not you want affir-
mative action, race based scholar-
ships, a diverse student body, etc. is
fine as long as your opinion is in-
formed.

You must ensure a diverse col-
lege population or at least publicly
denounce trying to have one, if that
is how you feel.

We all know Davidson is com-
mitted to diversity, and we all come
here knowing that, so we should
utilize what diversity we have bet-
ter than we do.

The basic step and most practi-
cal widespread solution to immedi-
ately better understanding our dif-
ferences does not mean integrating
the court or increasing our ethnic
numbers.

It means talking with someone
who comes from a different back-
ground than you. A suggestion at
the forum was just to make sure that
people eat with a person of a differ-
ent background and talk.

The benefits of “just connect-
ing” are enough and will be natu-
rally realized,

All you need to do is talk and
reach, and you will "connect."
