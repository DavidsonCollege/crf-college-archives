Amber Waves of Grain
Artist Thanks Students

To the Editor:

The Davidson Union Gallery
Committee would like to thank the
Pattern Court Houses, the SGA,
faculty, staff, and especially all the
individual students who helped
with Amber Waves of Grain. Your
support was crucial to the success
of this exhibit. The following letter
was sent to Ruth Pittard, Program
Coordinator of the Union, from
Barbara Donachy, the artist of the
exhibit:

Dear Ruth,

It was good to meet all of you.
I was very moved and impressed
by the professionalism and sincer-
ity of the students who were in-
volved. This was the first time that
students have brought this exhibit

toa campus. When J arrived I kept
wondering when! would meet the
faculty who were behind it all, but
it was not long before I realized
that there were no such people!
Except for the careful guidance of
yourself.

The installation and arrange-
ments for the show were as well
done (sometimes better) than those
of any of the museums or galleries
we have worked with in the past.

lam encouraged also by the
many students who I talked with.
They make mefeel optimisticabout
the future.

Thanks for the opportunity.

Best wishes,
Barbara

Quality of Life Report
Needs Attention

To the Editor:

I've just read the Davidson
Quality of Life Task Force Report.
Iwas soimpressed by its scopeand
by the professional manner in
which it was collected and pre-
sented that I was moved to visit
John Kuykendell to talk with him
about it. I found that his response
to the Report was similar to my
own: he was very impressed with
the quality of the commendations
and recommendations madeinthe
Report, but he was completely dis-
appointed with the lack of student
and faculty response. I think this
lack of response is in part due toa
general lack of. knowledge of the
existence of the Report.

The Report commends the col-
lege for its existing and excellent
characteristics, and goes on to
address its inadequacies and to
make many well-considered rec-
ommendations for its improve-
ment. These recommendations
were made on the basis of your re-
sponses to the Task Force’s inquir-
ies concerning what the college as
anentity candotoimprovecertain
aspects of the quality of life here at
Davidson. If the Report is given the
attention it demands from students,
faculty, and the Trustees, I think
Davidson has a chance of becoming the
best undergraduate facility in the
United States. If not, itruns the risk
of becoming a Ivy-clone student-
mill in which the overall stress is
is puton faculty publication -- and
the attention given to the individ-
ual student will becompletely lost.

Thestrengthof theCollegeand
its Stated Purpose may soon be
subsumed to the seduction of na-
tional “recognition.” One of the
main reasons Iam proud to gradu-

from Davidson is due to the incal-
culable contribution that its com-
mitment to measa student hasmade
tomy growthand education.Given
the direction that faculty policy is
going , this commitment is in dan-
ger of disappearing completely--
becoming an empty promise. Let
the national reputation of the col-
lege stand on its excellence as a
demanding undergraduate insti-
tution where faculty “actually care”
(surprise!) about the students, and
itcannot help but be recognized. It
would bea tragedy tohavesomany
articles written recently about this
quality only to have it evaporate.

If you have not read this de-
tailed and comprehensivereport, I
highly recommend that you go to
the library reserve reading desk
and request it. It appraises every-
thing from student housing facili-
ties, to faculty opinion of student
performance, to the “self-selection
system.” Your interests are most
certainly represented.

The president will be present-
ing the report to the trustees this
week, and their positive or nega-
tive response to it will affect how
the college will change--for better
or worse--over the next four years.
This is an opportunity for student
and faculty opinions and interests
to be represented in an historical
decision by the trustees. Do not
mistake the importance of thisreport to
your future and the future of the col-
lege. '

I would like to present my
thanks and respect for everyone
involved in the project and I ap-
plaud their efforts to improve our
College and our community.

Dominican Republic Was A
Memorable Experience

D. J. SNELL '90

Last week’s Davidsonian con-
tained anarticle based onan inter-
view with myself about my spring
break trip to the Dominican Re-
public. Upon reading this article I
was disappointed to see that many
of my comments and a number of
facts were misrepresented. I under-
stand that writingaboutan experi-
ence second hand is difficult, and
therefore this articleis notintended
to be an indictment of the paper or
theauthor.I merely wish tocorrect
some facts and present some per-
sonal insight gained from our trip
to the Dominican Republic.

This trip was one of the most
enlightening weeks in my life,
dramatically changing my percep-
tion of the world around me. The
idea of taking a Davidson College
group to the Dominican Republic
came tome while watching a video
in Grace Covenant Church in Cor-
nelius last fall. The video described
the need for an orphanage in the
Dominican Republic. Because of
construction delays, however, no
construction teams were needed.
As a result of Mark Johnson’s ef-
forts, we were directed to Youth
for Christ,a missions organization
that located a need within the
community and planned the de-
tails of our trip. Thanks to the hard
work of Samuel and Sharon Melo
(our contacts in the D.R.) we only
had toraise our money and sched-

ule our flights to and from Santo:

Domingo. ‘

We sought funding and su
port for our trip from various
sources: Grace Covenant Church
of Cornelius gave $2,000 for the
trip; home churches supported the
various participants; the Staley
Foundation provided scholarship
funds for a number of participants
as well; Charlotte Coca Cola Bot-
tling Company, Bicycle Toy and
Hobby Sales of High Point, and the
parents of Karen McDowell also
helped pay for the trip. All of the
students contributed their own
money to make up the sizable
portion that remained.

We arrived in the Dominican
Republic on Saturday, March 10 to
begin our spring break adventure.
Each day began with a quiet time
and breakfast before working from
9 am until 5 pm with a break for
lunch, We then had dinner fol-
lowed by a trip to town or a meet-
ing with local missionaries and
friends involved with Youth for
Christ. Our work consisted of
building a wall to protect a hospi-
tal from the traffic and crowds that
have resulted from the construc-

tion of factories in a newly desig-.

nated tax-free zoneacross thestreet.
These factories have attracted a

large number of workers to the ~

area, including a group of 1,500
which moved in behind the hospi-
tal literally overnight. You can
imagine the chaos caused by such
an influx to a region with none of
the modern amenities that we are
so accustomed to. As a result of
this dramatic change in surround-

ings, the hospital needed some
protection from its once-tranquil
surroundings.

The work was rewarding, but
the most important part of our trip
was the interaction that we had
with the people around us. As we
worked on the wall, many people
would stop to watch us. They
would urge the women not to get
their hands dirty and would often
venture to show us how to lay the
cement more efficiently. Casual
conversations taughtusa greatdeal
about the country we had come to
visit and to help in such an insig-
nificant way. Our interaction was
not limited to the work area. One
afternoon half of the group went
into one of the communities that
had been thrownup overnight. The
houses were made of wood frames
with cardboard for walls and
maybe a towel or sheet for a door.
These houses had norunning water
and no sanitation facilities.

Wesawseveral little boys with-
out clothes playing with a plastic
bag in the dirt. We gathered some
of the children from the commu-
nity around to play games, sing
songs, and share a Bible lesson.
Thearticlein the lastissue said that

... this trip was one of

weeks in my life, dra-

matically changing my

world. eee

changed. by this experience?” |
responded “not to any great ex-
tent.” This was a grossly inaccu-
rate quotation. I had been asked if
I was surprised by what] had seen,
and because I had been in Jamaica
over the summer where I had seen
very similar slums in Kingston, I
responded "no." Whether or not I
was affected by what I saw is a
totally different issue. I had not
beenable to gointo suchacommu-
nity when I was in Jamaica, there-
fore I had seen the slums but not
really “experienced” them even to
the small extent that I had in the
D.R. In the Dominican Republic
we were brought face to face with
children and adults who lived in
conditions that we often only tead
about.

I was amazed by the condi-
tions of their lifestyles and the
reality of their hardships, but was
overwhelmed by the joy which
these people showed despite their
impoverished state. So often we
moan about not having the right
car and are depressed because we
did not get the grade we wanted,
while these kids are happy just to
get some food to eat and fortunate
if they get a bath. These children
are happy in spite of their condi-
tions. What a lesson that provides
for usin the “land of plenty!” That
afternoon changed my life immeas-
urably.

At the end of the week, we
madeanother visit whichimpacted

me equally as much. This time we
went to a leper colony outside of
the city of Santo Domingo. While
we spent less than an hour in the
colony and gave candy to the pa-
tients, the exchange was far greater
than you might imagine, Our visit
reminded me ofa passage from the
Bible (Luke 8:1-3), in which Jesus
healed a leper. Jesus could have
spoken and healed the leper, but
instead hereached outand touched
the leper. In Out of the Salt Shaker,
Becky Pippert notes that in Jesus’s
time, the lepers were considered
outcasts and untouchables. The
same is true today. These people
were put outside of the city into a
monastery-like environment
where nuns took care of them. We
were told thatmany ofthese people
were rejected by their families and
wereallalone. WhenJesus touched
the leper, he healed the man emo-
tionally as well as physically by
accepting him as a human being
worth His attentionand His touch.
I thinkin some way we were doing
the same for the people we met,
talked with and touched. Even
though these people were not con-
tagious, the touching and the visit-
ing showed them. that someone
cared about who they were. I will
never forget the face of one man
who was overjoyed to have visi-
tors and who wanted to share his
life with anyone that would listen.
Indeed, he was rejoicing in spite of
his ¢gndition. §  ** "

One quote from the other ar-
ticle was correct though taken out
of context. I had said “I think weas
“missionaries’ were more mission-
ized’ by the people we came to
help.” I think everyone who went
on the trip would agree with this
assessment. I found that these
people had so much to offer in a
lesson about life and rejoicing in
their condition.

Ilearned that had been blessed
with so much in my life that I have
taken for granted. I will certainly
never take indoor plumbing for
granted again! But I also learned a
lesson that can be applied to rela-

tionships here at Davidson. Weare

surrounded by people who may
feel like outcasts, very much like
the lepers in the D.R. We may
choose to continue on our busy
path since we all have ten million
things to do before the year ends,
and ignore those around us who
are hurting.

On the other hand, we may
take time out to reach out to that
person, to get to know them and to
listen to their concerns. If we are
the ones that are hurting inside,
when we reach out to meet the
needs of others, wemay find some-
one who is dealing with feelings
similar to our own. Take time out
to give to your friends and fellow
students. In giving of yourself, you
will probably gain far more than
you are able to offer. In giving of
myself to go to work in the Do-
minican Republic, I was blessed
more than I can ever repay
