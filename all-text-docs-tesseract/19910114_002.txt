University of Florida

Police Increase Patrols
GAINESVILLE, FL. - Hoping to
protect students who may be less
careful about their own security
as they return to school the week
of January 7, Gainesville police
announced they will increase se-
curity patrols in and around the
University of Florida campus.

It was in August, at the start
of last semester, that five students
were slain in off-campus apart-
ments.

At the same time, city offi-
cials lobbied in Washington, D.C.
for help in paying for the esti-
mated $3 million six police agen-
cies have spent in chasing more
than 5,500 leads in the still-un-
solved murder cases

Student Alcohol Use

Rises Nationwide

Nearly all first-year colle-
gians drink heavily, and fre-
quently “binge” on five or more
drinks at one sitting at least once
every other week, anew study by
Harvard’s Schoolof Publy Health
contends.

The study of 1,669 students
also found they used less mari-
juana, cocaine and tobacco than
first-year students interviewd in
a similar 1977 study.

during the holiday season, when
campuses were virtually depopu-
lated.

At Peninsula College in Port
Angeles, Washington, President
Paul Cornaby announced tuition
next fall would rise by 9 percent
for in-state students.

On December 11, Seattle Pa-
cific University announced a
price hike of 7 percent, “which
administrators forecast to. be
lower than the increase in the
1990 Consumer Price Index
(CPI).” The CPI, however, rose
by less than 5 percent in 1990.

A surprise mid-year tuition
hike of $300, however, prompted
about 20 City University of New
York students to sit-in at a cam-
pus library December 20.

Young Americans

A majority of Americans
aged 16-to*24 favor the death

keeping marijuana illegal, anew
Gallup Poll conducted by Fuji
Photo Fil, U.S.A., Inc. showed.

Forty-nine percent of 1,003
people surveyed described them-
selves as politically conserva-
tive, while 39 percent called
themselves liberal.

Some 31 percent of the re-
spondents supported reinstating
a military draft of young people :

HIV Rate of I in 500

Associated Press

BOSTON- About one in 500
USS. college students is infected
with the AIDS virus, and further
spread of the disease is likely on
campuses unless students change
their sexual habits, according to
the Federal Centers for Disease
Control.

“Risky behaviors are occur-
ring, and now we know we have
the infection,” said Dr. Helene D.
Gayle, who directed the study. “It
is cause for concern and appropri-
ate attention.”

The CDC study is the first
nationwide attempt to judge the
prescence of HIV on college cam-
puses, said coauthor Dr. Richard
P. Keeling of the American Col-
lege Health Association. It shows
that the virus probably is about as
common there as in the public at
large.

However, the researchers cau-
tioned that AIDS still could spread
dramatically among college stu-
dents, just as some other sexually
transmitted diseases have done.

each individual, “ said Yoder.

“I think probably the most
important thing from this study is
that it shows us the potential,” said
Keeling, who also runs the stu-
dents health service at the Univer-
sity of Virginia. “The combination
of a sexually transmitted disease
tossed into campus behavior has
the potential for very serious con-
sequences in the future. It also
shows us we have an opportunity
to prevent that.”

The study was based on ran-
dom testing of blood samples
drawn from 16, 863 students at 19
schools,, most of them large state
universities.

The study found that 30 stu-
dents, or two-tenths of one percent
of the students, were infected with
the virus. At 10 of the 19 cam-
puses, the survey found no AIDS
infections.

This survey, published in

- Thursday’s New England Journal

of Medicine, also found that stu-
dents over age 24 were seven times
more likely than younger students
to be infected.

Faculty Members McMillen and

Abbott Receive Honors

By Keri Slater

Davidson Professors Sally
McMillen of the History depart-
ment, and Anthony Abott, chair-
man of the English department,
have recently received honors for
their respective work.

The National Endowment for
the Humanities awarded Dr.
McMillen a fellowship for teach-
ers. She won the grant on the basis
of her application in which she
described her interest in the Sun-

day School movement in the New
South (1870-1920). She plans to
research this area as a means of
understanding how children of that
period were socialized.

McMillen will travel to librar-
ies throughout the south to study
Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyte-
rian churches.

She will concentrate on how
Sunday Schools affected the so-
cialization of southern people,
specifically habits such as drink-

ing and work ethics. Also, she
wants to include black’ Sunday
Schools in her research. She feels
that “churches took on the role to
regenerate the south”.

McMillen palns to incorporate
the research obtained during this
year long sabbatical in a book about
this topic. She says she will miss
teaching, but will be back next
year.

Abbott was awarded with the
Sam Reagan prize for his poetry.

C olleges Aren't As Involved In

Scores of campuses report stu-

mushrooming. At George Wash-

students studied abroad during the
1989-90 school year, up 43 per-
cent from the previous year.
