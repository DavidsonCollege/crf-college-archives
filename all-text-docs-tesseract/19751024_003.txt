Stone comments on class,

By RON NESSEN

In the most shocking event
at Davidson since the last time
Chip Stone was seen in his
office, the entire freshman
class disappeared sometime
during the first few weeks of
this term.

Neither hide nor hair has
been seen of the first-year-men
since.

The loss was discovered
Tuesday night by Freshman
Advisor Tony Abbott, as he
rode his bike past Watts
Dormitory.

Exactly when the freshmen
disappeared is still a subject of
great speculation. No one on

/ campus can remember the last
s time they actually saw a

freshman, much less spoke to
one.
As one freshman hall coun-

selor, Paul Banta, put it,
‘When did this happen? I just
assumed they were all in the
library.”

President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. displayed his custom-
ary concern about students.

“I’m sure that everything
possible is being done by the
proper authorities to resolve
this situation. Dean Terry, is
working on it right now,’’ he
said.

Dean Will H. Terry was
notified shortly thereafter.
‘“‘Whaaaaaaat? Why didn’t my
informants, _ err.....contacts
inform me? I’m certain,
though, that President Spen-
cer is doing everything in his
power to rectify the situ-
ation.”

The Davidson police force is
also mystified by the disa-
ppearance. ‘‘I wasn’t even
sure there was a freshman
class this year. We’ve been
investigating, but we have no
leads as of right now. We just
know they’re not at the 7-11,”
said Lieutenant Joe Hughes.

“It’s difficult to work with-
out being able to pinpoint the

but none were sure that the
Cannon Dormitory was even
occupied, since the only places
they'd ever seen any of this
year’s freshmen were Slater’s
and the library,’’ explained
Hughes.

‘‘Due to the speculation
about the existence of the
freshman class, we can’t send
out an all-points bulletin.”’

Available information
seems to place the disappear-
ance of the freshmen sometime
around the deadline for the
first Humanities theme, which
makes guessing even more
difficult because most fresh-
men would not be around
anyway.

The police seemed confident
that the freshmen would be
found soon. ‘‘After all, we’re
not even certain it was foul
play. First of all, an operation
of this sort would involve a lot
of people and equipment. That
would have been easily not-
iced.

“Second of all, why would
anyone want them?”’

ance.

Leland Park , director of

the library, announced that the

library has 369 more books in
October than reported in last
month’s inventory.

‘*Most of these 369 books
bear the stamps of other
libraries,’’ commented Parks.

These books come from
various institutions from ac-
cross the state. Included in the
new collection are books from
University of North Carolina,
Wake Forest, and Duke Uni-
versity.

‘‘We have to figure a bare
minimum of $10.00 per book.

That means gains of at least
$3,000 to $4,000 each year.
But the best aspect of these
acquisitions is not the finan-
cial but rather the fact that a
great number of the acquired
books are irreplaceable to their
mother institutions.”’

Plans now call for the
development of a special dis-
play called “New Acquisi-
tions,’ ta include books from
the various libraries.

‘A free library is very.much
of a privilege, and exists
mainly because of the honor
system,’’ commented Parks.

Wilensky to edit Update,
Lawrimore takes new post

By MARTHA BYRD
Staff Writer

Tuesday morning, Mark
Wilensky was named to the
position of editor of the Davi-
dson Update. The paper is the
Alumni newsletter of a small
liberal arts college of 1300
students in rural N.C.

The move came surprisingly
fast as College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. named
Wilensky to the post only 12

‘hours before former Update

Editor Buck Larrimore re-
signed his position at the
College. Mr. Larrimore will go
to New York to become sports
editor for Guideposts Maga-
zine.

This is a real opportunity
for me,” said Larrimore. ‘‘It’s
simply stupendous to go from
the Greatest Alumni paper of
the past 20 years to what will
be the leading monthly in
America for the next decade.

Dr. Norman Vincent Peale
said that he had been studying
my work on the Update for
some time now, and that I
appeared to be optimistic

enough tor the job.

“I’m already working on a
story of a succesful Davidson
football star who at the peak
of his playing career at Davi-
dson met the Lord and became
a success. Did you know that
Davidson College is a small
liberal arts college of 1300
situated in rural N.C.?”

In making the announce-
ment for the College, Presi-
dent praised Wilensky.
“We're really happy to have
Mark 6n our payroll. I’ve been
looking out for him ever since
he has been at Davidson, and
am pleased to have him closer
to my side.

“Mark was a fairly simple
choice,’’ remarked Spencer.
‘‘We needed someone who
could fill Buck’s shoes, and
Mark stepped right in.”

‘‘I want to pledge to all
students that the Update will
have something for them,
too,’’ said Wilensky. ‘‘For
starters, we will have Dr.
Nelson in an evening gown
sitting in that damn captain’s
chair, and a story on how the
