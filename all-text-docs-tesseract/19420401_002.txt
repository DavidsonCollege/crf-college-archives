Dr. I. W. Johnson, besides belonging
to Phi beta Kappa and O. D. K., was

with each of the twenty-nine Davidson

year, according to the National

were based on dietary standards set

Among all fats butter with 16 per

Why has the Davidson faculty,
or whoever is responsible, been so
sadistic to arrange it that the
reports come out during the holi-
days? Why not, just as well, after
you return to school?

So they treat you as though “you

overlook the fact that you've spent
far more money than your allow-
ance permits, They forget that
you lose over half your clothes,
and say nothing when you buy a

do not re-protest about your smok-
ing. In fact, everything is hotsy-
totsy. :

That’s the first day or so. Then
your report arrives. Bang! Every-
thing becomes coldsy-toldsy.

Now the problem confronting
you ise how to minimize these an-
noying effects that you report must
necessarily produce. Certainly the
best solution is to go to New York
or Washington instead of going
home. In such event you will prob-
ably have just as good, if not a
etter, time, and, which is more
important, you will not be at home
when the report arrives.

But if such recourse is not pos-
sible, there remains nothing to do
but face the music. The best way
to allay parental ire is to start talk-
ing the minute you get home. For
instance, deplore your misfortune
in your English reviews. If you
had just understood two of” the
questions you would have made a B
