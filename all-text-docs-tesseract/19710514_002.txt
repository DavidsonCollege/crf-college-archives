The Rush Is On

For Registration

Registration for classes for
the fall term of the next ac-
ademic year has been sched-
uled for Monday, Tuesday
‘and Wednesday, ‘and there
will be several changes in
the format.

According to Dr. Richlard
C. Burts, college registrar,
the changes in registration
should help because iit will
give tthe s@udents a chance
to chose alternate courses
and because iit will make
screening by professors of
classes possible.

The registration _ forms,
which were mailed to stu-
dents Wednesday, include in-
structions for registnation.

Burts emphasized that the
present process iis the finial
registration ‘and that there
will be no pre-registnaton for
classes.

“In the past when we've
had pre-registration, the stu-
dents have ihad ithe attitude
that they can talways elasily
chiange their schedules,"
«Burts said. ‘Now, since there
will be no other registration,
we iare hoping for a serious-
ness about tit that willl be ben-
eficial."’

Burts pointed out that stu-
dents can register for only
the fall term, and can simply
plan tentative schedules for
their personal use for tthe
winter land spring terms.

‘According to ‘Burts, the stu-
dents will ‘be given alternate
choices for courses in case
their primary courses sare tal-
ready filled, or a professor
screens them out iof his class.

Under ithe new. registnation
procedure, the student must
get ‘approval from his iadvis-
er ito take the courses’ of his
choice. He then goes to the
individual professor teaching
the course to get ‘the profes-
sor’s ‘approval and signature
land to receive ia ‘‘course
card."’ This process, Burts
pointed out, gives the stu-
dent tthe chance to find out
from the professor whatt the

course will require and will
give the professor the op-
portunity to screen the stu-
dent.

On Monday rising seniors
willl go through the registra-
tion procedure between the
hours of 10 ‘and 11 in the
morning and between 3:30
4:30 that afternoon. Rising
juniors will register on Tues-
day at the same times, and
rising sophomores will reg-

ister during the two hour —

sessions on Wednesday.

‘Burts said that ‘‘this should
be ia firmer registration witth
fewer changes later. It should
be ‘a more effective registra-

tion,”

Publicity for the week was

Window shopping this week
in downtown Davidson also
had more to offer ‘than a fa-
cade of fabric and hardware
tools. Everywhere there were
posters created by primiitive
bands armed with crayolas.

Local school children spon-
sored this project, and a
prize will be awarded for
the best poster. And there
were some excellent ones,
phrased as only a child can.

“And the song said Amer-
ica was beautiful,’’ goes one
poster with ‘a lime green
Martian standing triumphant-
ly on the earth, which is
swallowed up in foaming
clouds of pollution.

Other posters contrast chil-
dren with sunshine faces
and balloons in their hands
with the trash in the back-
ground.

These events climax . 'to-
morrow with Town Day, a
roster of festivities, includ-
ing a parade, carnival rides
‘and amusements, games and
contests, and good country
and western and gospel mu-
sic by local groups. fe

All ithese activities will
take “place, at ‘an outdoor
parking area on the corner
of Griffith and Main Street,
and there will be a supper
with fish and hot dogs to cap
off the day.

The Sigma.Chi house will
officially fold for next year,
and some of the other houses
moving off campus hope to

is a good indication that it
will.

“Every fireshmain got his

Admissions Fifteen Short
Of 300 Mark Next Fall

The Office of Admissions
has been informed by 285
students that they have ac-
cepted Davidson's offer of
admission to the Class of
1975.

Although the goal of 300
for next year's freshman
class ‘has not been achieved,
ithe Office of Admissions
feels that it will be met.

Thirty individuals have not
informed Davidson of their
final intentions for © next

year. Some of these 30 have
agreed ‘to come to Davidson
next year, but their $100 de-
posits have not been receiv-
ed by the Office of Admsi-
sions ‘and they iare not count-
ed towards the 300 goal.

Davidson's minority  stu-
dent population will be in-
creased by one Mexican-
American student and six
blacks. Twelve blacks have
been ‘accepted, and there is
the possibility that eight will
enroll next year.
