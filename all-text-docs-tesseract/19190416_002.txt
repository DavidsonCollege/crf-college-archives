“GIVE US SOME MORE.”

Other music—Orchestral, Vocal or
[nstrumental—pleases different people at
different times, but at what time, under
what conditions, does not a spirited band:
performance arouse the enthusiasm of
all the people? Men, women and chil-
dren, all alike, we rush to a window
or a street corner to hear the band. With
quickened pulse beat and brightened cyes
we mark time as it files by.

Yes, the fascination of martial music
by the band on parade—operatic and
popular music by the band in the park
or in the auditorium—is admitted on all
sides. The charm never grows old.

Some pleasures have a temporary at-
traction, We like them for the time
being, but fickle fancy tires of the same-
ness, and, butterfly-like, flits to other ob-
jects of interest. Not so with the mu-
sic of the band, especially when it hap-
pens to be the town or college band—
composed of home talent—known to one
and all of the listeners, most of whom
have had a hand in its otganization and
support.

Under such conditions the continued
popularity of the band’s work is doubly
assured. Like the brook in ‘Tennyson's
poem, it “goes on forever.”

From the Atlantic to the Pacific, from
the Great Lakes to the Gulf, in every
community the desire for a brass band
is manifesting itself today. Not only
in cities, towns and villages, but college
communities are also beginning every-
where to organize their own bands.

A few days ago the Mooresville band
road up in front of White's drug store
and began to play. Before it had fin-
ished the first piece, men, women and
children came running from every place
imaginable. Like the rats of Hamlin
every one of us were mysteriously drawn
from our work by the magic music of
our friends from Mooresville. Many
after a long run sat down on the cam-
pus to enjoy this music, but as soon as
we had settled ourselves and had caught
our breath the truck moved off. All
the protests and pleadings of the crowds
were of no avail, for before the shouts
of “Give us some more” had died away
the truck had disappeared around the
corner.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, April 16, 1919

We want some more, is the sentiment
of the entire community at Davidson.
We can have it, if our own boys will get
together and organize a College Band.
‘There is enough talent among the stu-
dents here at Davidson to organize a
band which would be a credit to any
student body. Why can not we have
one?

The only qualifications necessary for
one to join a band are first of all: He
should be a music lover, and last, he must
be willing to devote sufficient time for
practice. Experience will come through
practice and study. And any one if he
likes’ music, with but few exceptions, can
learn to play well if he will but study
and practice.

Many of us well remember the open
air concerts which the Davidson Band
pave last year in front of Elm Row. ‘Phe
same thing can be repeated this year if
we will get together, All those interest-
ed in a band for Davidson and are will-
ing to back it, will help in securing a
band if @hey will write out their name
and the instrument which they can or

HOW TEXAS SCHOOL
BOYS SAVED

‘Thirty thousand boys in the agricul-
tural clubs of “Texas are training them-
selves in thrift, business management and
the serious work of life. A recent in-
vestigation among these boys showed re-
sults that are reported in the Country
agent. \t was found. that 67.4 per cent.
owned Thrift Stamps and War Savings
certificates averaging $19.30 per boy, a
total of $382,854 was owned by 19,831
boys. In Liberty bonds 15.4 per cent.
reported ownership averaging $59.32 or
a total of $264,306 for 4.532 boys.

‘Twenty-six per cent, have a bank ac-
count, averaging $64.83 each, or a total
of $496,014.33 for 7,510 boys, while the
total value of the livestock or other
property that has been accumulated since
becoming a club member amounted to
$1.317,993.18, or $65.66 each for 20.-
073 boys, which is 68.2 per cent of the
entire membership.

On top of that the boys showed 66.6
per cent membership in the Red Cross,
$2.88 each or a total of $56,511 for 19,-
622 boys. 3

iness men, begin now.

RECRUITING FROM THE BOT-
TOM.

1 have always thought that we. over-
look the fact that the real sources of
strength in the community come from
the bottom. Do you find society re-
newing itself from the top? Don’t you
find society renewing itself from the
ranks of unknown men? Do you look

to the leading families to keep on lead-| We hope them all kinds of success. Now

ing you? Do you look to the ranks
of the men already established in au-
thority to. contribiite sons to lead the
next generation? They may—sometimes
they do—but you can’t count on them;
and what you are constantly depending
on is the rise out of the ranks of un-
known men, the discovery of men whom
you had passed by, the sudden disclos-
ure of capacity you had not dreamed of,
the emergence of somebody from some
place of which you had thought the
least, of some man unanointed from on
high, to do the thing that the genera-
tion calls for. Who would have looked
to Lincoln to save a nation? Who that
knew Lincoln when he was a lad and
a youth and a young man—but all the
while there was springing up in him, as

would like to play on, and drop it in the’

genius. And it is to such sources that}!SEVERAL ADDITIONS TO BE

we must always look. No man can cal-
culate the courses of genius, no man can
foretell the leadership of nations. And
so we must see to it that the bottom is
left open; we must see to it that the
soil of the common feeling, of the com-
mon consciousness, is always fertile and
unclogged, for there can be no fruit un-
less the roots touch the rich sources of
fife. And it seems to me that the school-
houses dotted here, there, and every-
where, over the great expanse of this na-
tion, will some day prove to be the roots
of that great’ tree of liberty which shall
spread for the sustenance and _protec-
tion of all mankind.—Woodrow Wilson.

W. AND L. WILL ERECT AN
ARCH. WHAT WILL WE
ERECT?

As a monument to the sons of Wash-
ington and Lee who have engaged in the
military service in the recent war Wash-
ington and Lee will construct a memo-
rial arch of stately grandeur and mag-
nificence.

President Smith informs us that the
University has already purchased all the
property in the neighborhood of the ve-
hicle entrance to the University at a
cost of ten thousand dollars. ‘The arch
will have its entrance at the corner of
Jefferson and Washington streets and
will extend all the way to the Lee me-
morial chapel. Stately columns corre-
sponding to those which comprise the
colonade on the campus will be erected
on each side of the Avenue and these will
be connected overhead by crescents. Then
on the columns will be engraved the
names of all the men of Washington
and Lee who have been in the service.
The central columns will contain the
bronze plates on which will be engraved
the names of the men who died in the
service. That this memorial will add
beauty and splendor to the already ma-
jestic campus of Washington and Lee
is apparent at first sight. It is the be-
ginning of a greater Washington and
Lee and we haope that before the move-
ment is over the job will be well done.
This arch will furnish a need which
has long been felt and no better oppor-
tunity could have presented itself.

While we have not been definitely in-
formed as to the matter it is likely that
an enthusiastic campaign will be launch-
ed to raise the necessary funds to erect
this arch. The greater part of the mon-
ey will probably be donated by the Uni-
versity, part will come from the scatter-
ed alumni and the student bodv will be
given an opportunity to donate to the
fund. When the movement is launched
it is hoped that every man on the cam-
pus will be imbued with a co-operative
spirit and will do all in his power to
make the campaign a_ success.—Ring-
Tum-Phi.

Washington and Lee has the spirit.

for Davidson's memorial. What shall

it be?

Lincoln said: “Die when I may, I
want it said of me by those who know
me best that 1 always plucked a thistle
and planted a flower where I thought a
flower would grow.” Nothing finer
could be said of this generation of Amer-
icans than that it plucked the thistle of
waste and planted in its stead the flower
of intelligent saving and investment .in

MADE TO FACULTY.

We are glad to report that both Dr.
Lingle and Dr. MacConnell will be back
next fall in charge of their respective
departments. A most suitable professor
of English has been secured, subject to
the action of the Board of Trustees.
‘There will probably be one or more new
instructors in the most popular depart-
ments, but nothing definite can be. said
about this at the present time. .

PIANO TUNING

You notice those who play
a Violin, Guitar or other
string instrument always
tighten the strings and get
them in tune every time
they begin to play. For
similar reasons pianos need
regular tuning — though
not so often. Once a year
is generally advised. The
spring is the best season for
this work — because the
weather conditions are
more uniform and favora-

ble.

My work may be examined by
the one you think is the best
judge either at the Gym, the
home of Dr. Richards or Mr.
J. R. Withers, Davidson. All
interested telephone 17-J, or
address me, P. O. Box, 12.
