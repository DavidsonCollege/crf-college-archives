Campus Rides

Drunk driving happens. We all know that it does. But because
Davidson has always been a residential campus, we have not acknowl-
edged it as a pressing problem on campus.

As aresult, drunk drivers hit Main, Concord and Highway 77 with
few other options. :

As parties move more and more off campus, students should take a
stand. on

Wake Forest has recently established a SADD chapter after two
girls were killed in a gory drunk driving accident. At Colgate, students
volunteer to give rides to reveling students every weekend.

Organizations could organize nights to give rides, and students
could pay —or individuals could volunteer and students could ride free.
Any sort of rides program would benefit students traveling off campus
— and save community and student lives in the process. ¢

Monopolies-on Campus

Students off-campus know the real story. BTI is a rip-off. A
detailed comparison is hardly necessary; a cursory look at the two
different bills will prove that normal rates are far below BTI rates.

Why is the campus using this system? Is it possible to re negotiate
so that students can get a fairer shake?

We laud the formation of the CPC (Consumer Protection Commit-
tee) and Lucian Dervan for forming it.

However, we hope that the committee will not become too mired in
student interviews and red tape. The SGA should move as swiftly as
possible to get to the bottom of this matter, and save current students a
few bucks for dinner each month.

The Male Gaze

To the editors:

I just received the Au-
gust 26 issue of The
Davidsonian viaa very long
and painful process involv-
ing one Ex-Opinions edi-
tor and the sketchy gen-
eral mail service of
Panama. Yes, it is mid-
October now, and_ this
probably won’t get back
to Davidson until mid-No-

.| vember, but I felt inspired

to write nonetheless.

I read Kristen
Richardson’s summer ac-
count of feminism and the
“male gaze” in England and
immediately related to her
experiences. I’ ve been trav-
elling ‘in Latin America
(mostly by myself) since July
and certainly have encoun-
tered much of what Kristen
refers to in her article “Sum-
mer Luvin’” written way
back when. No, I’m not
talking about torrid afairs
with Latin lovers. Unfortu-
nately, I’m talking about

sexual harassment!’ ve dealt
with in Mexico and Central
America. Ironic? Yes, be-
cause I’m supposed to be
here to study “Women Jour-
nalists, Feminists, and the
Alternative press in Latin
America” and have found
much more machismo than
feminismo.

ust as Kristen felt in

England, the constant stares, _
cat-calls, and hisses enrage ©

and sometimes dampen my
feminist spirit. Traveling
solo as a woman in this part
of the world is not easy; in
Latin America, harassment
comes with the territory.
Yes, Iam well aware that the
hisses are a “cultural thing.”
But while it may be “cul-
tural,” it’s still degrading,
objecxtifying, and violating
to women. And knowing
that it’s “cultural,” doesn’t
make it any easier for an
American feminist to deal

_ with.

Thankfully, Kristen and
Ihave the awareness and the
opportunity to respond to

such degradation in forums
like The Davidsonian. Many
women in Latin America do
not have these benefits.
Many women here and in
other parts of the world ac-
cept the hisses and the stares,
the beatings and the rapes,
the harrassment and the op-
pression because they don’t

even the legal right to speak
out against such injustices.
Thankfully, Kristen andIdo.

So maybe it’s not so
ironic after all. In many
ways, this is exactly what
my project is about. And as
I’m sure Kristen would
agree, it’s all part of the
amazing and rewarding ex-:
perience of travelling

’ abroad, living in and learn-

ing about other cultures
while gaining a greater per-
spective of our own.
