Gobblers Anxious For _
Vengeance On Wildcats

Davidson Meets V. P. I. at Blacks-
burg in Hardest Battle of Season

Admittedly the hardest game on David-
son’s schedule will be played this week at
Blacksburg, Va., when the Red and Black
machine invades V. P. I.’s territory. The
Gobblers, who last yeat were held to a score
of 7-7 on Sprunt Field, will be waiting
eagerly for the- opportunity of wreaking
vengeance on the Wildcats.

Dope has it that their chances will be very
good for inflicting said vengeance. In the
line ¢e Techmen can count on six heavy let-
ter men—Rodes, at end; Baker, Green, and
Graham, a Gackles; Roe and Shertz, at
guard—averaging about 180 pounds. At
center, Moran will add 190 pounds of
avoirdupois to the line-up. From last year’s
Freshman team Holley will step into a wing
position, while Hammock, another Sopho-

more, will be making someone hustle forea |

In the backfield, Sutton will probably
guide the Gobblers as captain and quarter—
the same Sutton who gave Davidson so much
trouble last. year. Rutherford, whose toe
