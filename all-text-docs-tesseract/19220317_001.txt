FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C.. MARCH 17, 1922.

Dr. J. M. Vander Meulen
Helps in Life Decisions
Helpful ‘Series of Addresses and

Conferences Last Week.

Dr. J. M. Vander Meulen, of Kentucky
Theological Seminary conducted a very
helpful Life Work Conference under the
auspices of the Davidson College Y. M.
C A, beginning Wednesday night and
continuing through Sunday.

In addition to his talks to the student
body, Dr. Vander Meulen held a series
ot personal conferences.

Wednesday Night.

The first of Dr. Vander Meulen’s in-
spiring talks was on the subject: “Con-
ditions of True Dicipleship.” He chose
as his text Matthew 16:24, using the
clause, “If any man will come after me,
let him deny himself, and take up his
cross, and follow me.”

He said that in following Christ there
were the three essentials of denying,
bearing of the cross and then following
Christ. In denying himself, man not
only must give up certain privileges, but
he must destroy the evil portion of his
personality. To strengthen the better
part of his personality, a man must kill
the lower self. The cross is not always
the cross of shame and pain but the
cross of altruism and the practice of
the Golden Rule.

Dr. Vander Meulen emphasized the
statement that to be a good leader, one
must know how to follow. He gave two
ways of becoming a good follower which
are Free Imitation of Christ and Obe-
dience to His Will. Christ gave us the
example of how to follow and acted as
the physician of our souls. With a
forceful illustration of a poor Greek
runner who obeyed his father, the speak-
er explained the way in which Christ ex-
pected us to obey Him.

Dr. Vander Meulen’s talk was filled
with splendid illustrations which im-
printed a clear “train of thoughts” upon
the minds of his hearers.

Thursday Night.

Thursday night, Dr. Vander Meulen
spoke to a full house on what is em-
bodied in the twenty-cighth verse of the
fourteenth chapter of St. Luke, “For
which of you, intending to build a tower,
sitteth not down first and counteth the
cost, whether he have sufficient to finish
it?” He forcefully drove home the fact
that a tower should be built no matter
what the cost.

One of the greatest tragedies in life,
he said, is a minister who was really
called to some other work and had gone
into the ministry. Possibly the greatest
tragedy is that of a man having his real
calling in the ministry and going into
some other line. He plainly brought
out that we should not «try to make
square pegs fit round holes, nor should

Davidson Will Be Well Represented
in Outdoor Meets.

With tract meets with V. P. I. at
Blacksburg, Va., N. C. State at David-
son, U. of S. C. at Columbia, and the
State meet at Trinity, the Red and
Black cinder squad is going to have the
incentive to “pep up.”

About 50 candidates answered the call
of Coach Grey and now are fully*on
their way to become proficient in the
art of using their legs. Freshmen, es-
pecially, are out in goodly numbers and
Hendrix, Koenig, and Guiton are show-
ing up especially well.

With the six letter men back, Gentry,
McGukin, McBryde, Galloway, Captain
Knight and Sprunt, Coach has an ad-
ntirable nucleus around which to’ build
a bunch of winning flashes. Last year
McBryde hung up a new college record
in the two-mile and this year itis con-
fidently believed that he will be able to
lower that mark. Galloway is going
good and will bring home the bacon for
more than one first place in the mile.
The jumping events will be ably taken
care of by McGukin*and Gentry and
aiso by W. M. Gracy, who is going to
make things hum for them. In the dashes,
Hendrix, Haye and Koenig are working
hard. The weights need no other than
Captain Knight to care for them and he
is out in “full dress” preparing to van-
quish all comers.

The hurdles’ are at present vacant,
but with the wealth of aspiring material
they should not remain so long.

Coach Grey.intends to carry 15 men on
all the trips this year, so there is plenty
of inducement for every one to work
hard. The schedule is one of the hard-
est the Red and Black has ever attempt-
ed, but the Wildcats should make the
fur fly when they invade the dens of
their opponents.

R. F. DAVIDSON IS CHOSEN
¢ NEW EDITOR
OF DAVIDSONIAN

The election of Editor-in-Chief and
Circulation Manager of the Davidsonian
for the year 1922-1923 was held last
Monday morning. At a recent mecting
of the staffof the Davidsonian, W. J.
Cooper was lected Business Manager,
which left the two above offices to be
filled by student body election.

There were three men nominated by
the staff for the position of Editor-in-
Chief. They were R F. Davidson, W. A.
Gamble, and D. H. Ogden. Of these
three, R. F. Davidson was elected as the
new Editor-in-Chief.

The two men nominated for {ircula-
tion Manager were S. C. Fain and Watt
McCain, the latter being chosen the
winner.

The remaining members of the new
staff will be appointed by the present
staff this week. The Davidsonian will
make its first appearance under the new
editors at the beginning of April.

Net Men Biaclicikg Hard
For Best Tennis
Team Yet

Knocking the Rubber Ball Back and
Forth in Great Style.

Prospects of the Wildcat tennis team’s
capturing State honors this year seem
unusually bright. Hugh Bradley, Curtis
Ormond, Ed Cunningham and Louis Wil-
kinson seem to have the edge on the
cther collegiate representatives. With
team Davidson will give every
college in the State a hard fight with all
indications pointing to their landing on
top. No definite dates have been made,
but two trips will be made; one to Caro-
lina, Trinity and one other college, and
the other to the State tournament during
the middle of May.

The team is especially fortunate in
securing as coach, Whitener, of Trinity,
last year’s State champion, now living
at Cornelius. This will prove a big asset
to the team this spring.

Seven courts will be marked off and
put into commission this season for the
host of tennis players. A player must
sign up for the court-he wants and can-
not hold it more than an hour if any
other racquet wielder is waiting on him.

In all other forms of athletics
consideration is shown to the team and
in tennis everybody would do the team
a big favor if they would keep off of the
varsity court. The team must have its
court in condition, so everyone is. re-
quested to play on the other courts.

This year a new plan will be followed
n the spring tournament. The chal-
fengers will hold a tournament and the
winner will be entitled to play the fourth
man on the team. Fraser, White, Henry
Morris, Myers, and Vic Brown, seem to
be the group of challengers. The team
will then hold a tournament -to ‘decide
the ranking of the different men and the
fourth will play the winner of the tour-
nament,
