Ransom To Lecture On

Ideal Of Southern Life

Dr. John Crowe Ransom, professor of

English at Vanderbilt University, will
lecture in Chambers Auditorium on

Tuesday evening, January 28, using as
his subject, “Traditional Southern Life
and the Means of Its Preservation.”

Dr. Ransom is a well known Ameri-
can poet an® essayist. His poems appear
in most any collection of modern Amer-
ican poetry, and his articles have been
published in many magazines of national
importance.

He has recently been active as the
leader of a group known as Young
Southern Agrarians. The members of

this group are interested in the preser-
vation of the Old Southern ideals or
way of living and hope that the South
will not undertake to become industrial-
ized. Dr. Ransom, along with Donald
Davidson, Frank Owsley, Allen Tate,
and Stark Young was a contributor to a
book on the same idea called’ /'I! Take
My Stand.

The following day at a convenient
period he will speak to the members of
the college English department and any
others who are interested in modern
English poetry. He will probably be
asked to read some of his own poems
at that time.

Dr. Ransom has studied at Oxford
as a Rhodes scholar and belongs to the

“Q Davidson” Banned From

Radio By Copyright Owners

Dispute Results in Removal of
Many Tunes From Air

Davidson College is a college without

a song—at least, as far as°radio broad-

casts are concerned, until special per-
mission can be obtained.

The whole matter is a result of a na-
tional conflict which has arisen between
publishers and broadcasting systems, and
has been brewing time. The
case of “O Davidson” is not as serious

for some
as of some other theme songs, such as
those of Paul Whiteman, Red Nichols,
and Ray Noble.

Recently B. S. Shields, '07, the com-
poser of “O Davidson,” sold the copy-

right to Thornton Allen, publisher of
college songs, and, according to this
firm, it has all rights at its disposal.

Therefore, due the trouble aroused
between publishers and broadcasting sys-
tems, Columbia will not allow “O Da-
vidson” be played on the airways
without from. ..the
holder of the copyright. Nor will it al-
low the broadcast of any other songs in
a similar predicament.
