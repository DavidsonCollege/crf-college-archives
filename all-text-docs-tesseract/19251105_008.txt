THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 5, 1925

Sin

>

Next Friday the freshmen go to Green-
ville, S. C., where the Furman freshmen
are to be met. Last year the Wild-
kittens were smothered until the driving
attack of many of the men whw are on
the Furman varsity today, 25 to 7, and
according to reports that have been drift-
ing out, the little Hurricane is just as
strong as it was last year, if not stronger.

It costs but seven dollars a month to go
to school in China, tuition, books, board
and room included. Of this, books con-
stitute the largest item of expense.—The
Flat Hat.

This trophy is given through the generosity
of Norris, Inc., of Atlanta, the famous candy
manufacturers, through Mr., Frank E. Low-
enstein. The trophy is a highly valued one,
Jand in itself speaks of the high quality of the
Norris candies, from whence it came: The
students of Davidson appreciate the’ gene-
rosity of the donors, and the sweetness of
Norris candies only exceeds the high regard
the students have for the generosity of the
manufacturers of such candies,

WILDKITTEN GRID TEAM

(Continued from page 1) |
and aided by a pass to Kell for 18 yards and|
a pass to Myers for 15 yards, put the ball on}
Duke's six-yard line. Kell gained four and a|
half yards, Black gained one, six inches to}
go for goal. On the next play Black failed |
to gain and the quarter ended.

On the opening play of the fourth period |
a delayed buck -was called for, and after |
the two lines had become one mass, Kell gave |
a flying leap, skimmed both lines and landed |
over for a touchdown. Wenberg failed on|
extra point. Other features of the last quar- |
ter were a gouple of completed passes by |
Duke for 24“and 18 yards each. Duke fum-|
bled again and Davidson recovered. Duke!
intercepted a Davidson pass on her owt 10- |
yard line, and in the closing minutes McCon- |
nell and Kerr both intercepted passes for |
Davidson.

The backfield star for the little Wildcats |
was Kell, both on defense and offense, with |
Black a stellar force on defense. Leftwich |
won first honors in the line, breaking through
consistently, accompanied oftentimes by both
LeFevre and Smith. The entire team was
fighting better than at any time this season. |
