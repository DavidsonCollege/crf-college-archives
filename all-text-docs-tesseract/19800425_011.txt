football’’ by Dave Rice, ex-
football coach and now Athletic
Director at New York’s Ford-:
ham University. Fordham’s Di-
vision III football team has a
budget of $35,600. Rice said
Fordham’s recent decision to

. stay in Division ITI and to play

only Division III teams led to
the ‘loss of a very important
part of our collegiate atmos-
phere in the fall.”
The Final Alternative:
Dropping Football -,

Playing in Division III would
save the college some money,
but the amount is uncertain. ‘‘I
am of the opinion,’’ Farrell said,
“that if the economy of
(football spending) gets so
bad we can’t run it on a quality
basis, we should drop football
and go club.’’ Cartmill agreed.
“If money is the overriding
factor for going to Division III,
consideration should be given to
dropping football,’’ he said.
However, Farrell added, ‘‘when
you start eliminating visible
programs, it will have an ad-
verse effect.”’

Institutions which have drop-
ped football for financial rea-
sons show mixed results in

alumni giving. Marquette Uni-
versity discontinued their foot-
ball program in 1961. Sports
Information Director Betsy
Bjaoobok said alumni giving
was not affected. ‘‘We don’t
have an athletic booster organi-
zation,” she added, ‘‘so there is
no money specifically desig-
nated for athletics.” University
of Bridgeport’s Athletic Direc-
tor Francis Poisson said ‘‘the
President claims alumni giving

has gone up”’ since football was:

dropped in 1974, although the
School of Physical Education
was “practically destroyed.”
Football Coach Bob Larsen said
the effect on University of
Chicago’s alumni giving when
football was phased out ‘in 1939
was ‘‘not too much.” ‘Chicago
has now reinstated an NCAA
Division III team with a $5000
budget. However, George
Washington University Athlet-
ic Director Robert Faris said the
1976 decision to stop the foot-
ball program had a ‘‘sizable
effect”’ on alumni spending.
Carnegie said he did not think
that if football were cut minor
sports at Davidson could “bring
in the same quantity of funds.”
It is espécially difficult to raise

excess of $800 from Byrd, who
said the merchandise would be
in the mail in four to six weeks,
PiKA member Mark Carpenter
said. Other fraternities and
eating houses’ orders brought
the total to around $3000.

Byrd insisted the checks be
made out to him personally.
Barkley said that Byrd gave
them convincing reasons why
the checks whould be made in
this way. ‘‘He was really
smooth,’’ Barkley said.

Carpenter said that he be-
came worried a few days ago
when the merchandise had still
not arrived. ‘‘We called a toll-
free number that Byrd had
given us, and we found it and an

‘alternate number to be discon-

nected,’’ Carpenter said.
Carpenter then called. the

Better Business Bureau in

Charlotte. ‘‘They said they

. knew nothing about the com-

pany,’’ Carpenter said. A call
was then placed to the Seneca,
S.C. Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber of Commerce
identified Mr. Lunsford as Pres-
ident of Specialty Sportswear
International, Byrd’s employer.

“Mr. Lunsford told us that he
was concerned,’’ Carpenter
said. ‘‘He assured us that his
company was still in business,”

Farrell, said, “I can’t imagine
‘how jt could.” It will i

Carnegie said, especially if the
teams are sucessful. “We've
had some success in football,”
Farrell said, ‘‘and some pro-:
mise, but no success in basket-
ball.”” Football has value, ‘Far-

student recruitment, and alum-

he admitted, “we are a problem.

You can’t play football ‘without

There must’ be a decision,
Farrell concluded, on ‘‘what is
better for the College.” “A lot

difficult.”” Sports Information:
Director Emil Parker added,

but he made no promises.
Lunsford also said: that Byrd
had left town with $5000 of the
company’s money and could not
be found.

Carpenter noted that this
sum plus the money from
Davidson and other North and

South Carolina ‘schools would.

probably be in the $10,000
range. Barkley said that Pem-
broke, Francis Marion, and the
University of South Carolina
are rumored to have been vic-
timized by Byrd.

Although Lunsford claims his
business is still operative, Rose
Enterprises, a sportswear com-
pany from Atlanta, seems to
think otherwise. ‘‘When a Rose

representative came to David-

son a few days ago, he told us
that the company in Seneca had
gone bankrupt back in January,
Carpenter said. Barkley then
called the North Carolina Attor-
ney General’s office. A staff
member from this office referred
the complaint to a staff attor-
ney in the South Carolina
Attorney General's office. That
office has already been working
on the case and has amassed
over 20 claimns against this
company, Barkley said.
Nevertheless, Lunsford main-
tains that his company is in
good shape, and said that Byrd

However, the Seneca Chamber

of Commerce office said that the
company’s phone service has

been stopped. The electrical

‘power is still on, though, so the

company may sill occupy the

office, Barkley said. ‘Lunsford

told us the problem with the

phones is just a ‘dispute with’
the phone company’,’’ Barkley |
said.

“Tt seems that Lunsford may
be leading us on,’’ Carpenter
said. Barkley thinks the com-

think they have gone bankrupt. ~
“They may just be having cash
flow problems,’ Barkley said.
The problem with the poe
company may have resulted
from unpaid bills and not from
the company’s disbanding, Bar-
kley suggested. If the company
still exists, as Lunsford claims,
then Byrd could have delivered
the orders before he left town,
Barkley said. Lunsford was
unsure when Byrd actually
“skipped town” because of tra-
vel commitments on the West
Coast, Barkley said. If Byrd
left after he delivered the
Davidson orders: then there
would be a chance for-restitu-
tion, Barkley noted. However,
no record of such an order has
been found.

As for the whereabouts of
Byrd, Barkley called a Mecklen-
