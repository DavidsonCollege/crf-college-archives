Different pay for different jobs

Work-study program divides jobs into three pay levels

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

A system for differentiating
pay between student work-
study jobs went into effect in
August. The system, designed
by Gordon Peck, associate
dean of Financial Aid, changes
the standard $3.35 per hour
wage and provides an incen-
tive component.

“Itseemed to be an equitable
twentieth century thing todo,”
said Peck,

“Different levels in pay rates.

is only fair,” he ‘continued.
“We wanted to give an incen-
tive to do a good job and have

students return [to the same ‘

assignment] from. year to
year.”

Peck also said that student
discontent and higher pay
rates at Vail Commons con-
tributed to the decision to
adopt anew program.

The pay lev:
the skill and ce ‘re-
quired for a job.,Grade I, for
students needing direct super-
vision, begins at $3.35/hr..A
degree of specialized knowl-
edge and skills is demanded
for Grade II, which pays $3.65/

Mpon--
“mean the work-study students

hr.

The highest pay, $4/hr., is
reserved for Grade III, where
individuals must possess pre-
vious experience in the field.
Only three jobs are included in
Grade Ill: Union weekend
manager, 900 Room manager
and weekend library supervi-
sor.

The program also incorpo-
rates a 20-cent annual raise as
an incentive to students to re-
turn to their previous assign-
ment.

A survey of work-study jobs
conducted last spring helped

-Peck form the classifications.

Supervisors submitted a de-
scriptionof current jobsas well
as anevaluationof work-study
students. On the basis of these
replies pay grades were set
and. some students were rec-
ommended for raises.

financial aid office is thus not
forced to ask for a budget in-
crease.

According to Peck, how-

ever, the federal government — As

currently funds 80 percent of
Davidson work-study pro-
grams and plans to cut its con-
tribution to 75 percent. Over
the next two years the rate will
fall to60 percent. This decrease
in government funding, as
well as a proposed increase of
the minimum wage from $3.35
to $4.35, threatens to cause

eproblems for the new pro-
gram. -

“I’m concerned that the gov-
ernment will obligate ustopay
more without giving us more,”
said Peck. “Maybe they'll ex-
empt college work-study pro-
grams or put in a grandfather
clause.”

Peck stressed that the pro-

-¥etthe rise in rates does not. gramis still.in

will receive larger salaries.
Since a ceiling exists on the
amount an individual may
earn per academic year, the
students in higher grades will

simply work less hours. The

‘its initial stages.
“We'll solve the problems as

they arise,” he said. “The pro-
gram is still developing, and
we know we have some rough
edges, but at least it’s a first
step--unequal pay for unequal
work.”

Michelle
Blake, Black Student
- Coalition (BSC) Sena-
tor and Chairperson of
» the ad hoc Student
Minority Situation
Committee, expressed
her committee’s con-
cern regarding minor-

ity students at Davidson. Stating that

“all of us are a bit ignorant,” Blake
began by emphasizing that the BSC
serves not as a “separating mecha-
nism” but as a support group for mi-
nority students at Davidson.

Blake continued by identifying four
main concerns for African-Americans
at Davidson. First, there is a lack of
African-American courses in the cur-
riculum. Presently, there is only one
such course, Modern Black Literature.
Blake also pointed out the shortage of
African-Americans in the gstudent
body--there are 64 African-Americans
enrolled out of a total student popula-
tion of 1397.

Although the numbers are slowly in-
creasing there remains a big dispropor-
tion of minority students at Davidson.

This underrepresentation is also evi-
dent in the faculty and staff. Lastly,
