McConnell neighborhood offers option for faculty

College develops 98 acres
for affordable housing
on Concord Road

By Katherine Hash

Davidson College continues
work on a 98 acre housing devel-
opment at the edge of town. The
McConnell neighborhood is de-
signed to keep college employees
in Davidson by offering them an
attractive and affordable housing
option.

The pace of development
around Davidson has increased as
Charlotte commuters recognize
Davidson’s desirability. Housing
prices have increased as supply
has decreased lessening the oppor-
tunities for faculty housing close
to Davidson’s campus.

The accessibility of faculty
and their involvement in the
Davidson community is an essen-
tial aspect of Davidson College.
The new housing development is
an effort to safeguard this close
relationship between students, fac-
ulty, and community. According
to Robert Sutton, Vice President
for Business and Finance, 90% of
current Davidson faculty live in
the town, but new faculty mem-
bers are choosing to live in
Cornelius and Mooresville. Sutton
hopes that the development of the
McConnell neighborhood will pro-

vide not a “one time fix” but along
term solution to this problem.

The McConnell neighborhood
consists of 98 acres of land situ-
ated out Concord road on the edge
of town to be developed over a ten
year period through a series of five
phases. Half of the 190 homes to
be built will be available to the
general public while the other half
will be reserved for college em-
ployees.

Of the 95 houses designated
for college personnel, half will be
sold and halfleased. The objective
of the lease lots, Sutton says, is to
make housing more affordable for
professors who will be able to own
a house without buying a lot. The
lease lots, which must be sold back
tothe college when the house owner
is no longer employed by
Davidson, will also enable the col-
lege to retain long term control
over 1/4 of the lots in the neighbor-
hood thus assuring the college of a
steady stream of faculty housing
into the future.

The idea for such a develop-
ment originated in the 50’s when
the school purchased the land from
the McConnell estate. The school
recently decided that it was time to

develop the land and hired
Davidson’ graduate John
Crosland’s Land Company to de-
velop an innovative approach. The
plan being used was selected, after
considering faculty/staff opinions,
from four submitted by residential

“land planners.

The completed neighborhood
will include five parks, a neighbor-
hood green, andapond. The streets
are being worked into existing
streets to facilitate the
neighborhood’s incorporation into
the town, and they will be lined by

sidewalks on both sides. Many
front walkways, garages, and car-
ports facing away from the street
have also been planned.

Sutton hoped to avoid build-
ing a “typical suburban develop-
ment” by precluding an entrance
monument or gate, offering a vari-
ety of houseplans in a wide range
of prices andsizes, and prohibiting
identical houses in close proximity.

Section 1 of Phase 1 has been
completed and 20 homes have al-
ready been sold. Donna Molinek,
Assistant Math Professor, and her

husband Frank Molinek, Assistant,
Head of Cataloging, have bought
one of the six houses already sold
to Davidson faculty. Dr. Molinek,
who had been renting one of 50
houses in Davidson owned by the
college, cites the desire to own
their own home as the primary
reason for moving. She also be-
lieves the McConnell neighbor-
hood will be “a great place to raise
kids.” Molinek does not believe
that many houses in the neighbor-
hood would be economically fea-
sible for one income families.

Dean Rusk speaker talks off record

The Dean Rusk program in
international studies sponsored a
talk with Scott Thompson entitled,
“US Policy in the Balkan” on Tues-
day, September 7 at the college
Union.

Thompson, a foreign service
officer of the Bulgaria desk in the
United States Department of State,
was required clearance from the
Bureau of Public Affairs for his
speach. Permission to talk at
Davidson was given with the stipu-
lation that “it was off the record.”

program. Reporters from the Char-
lotte Observer andthe Davidsonian
were asked not to report anything
that was discussed in the meeting.

Davidson is able to secure top
officials, like Thompson, with the
help and influence of Ambassador
Jack Perry, Director of the Dean
Rusk program.

Correction:

Last week, The
Davidsonian incorrectly spelled
a new history professor's name.
The correct spelling is John
Wertheimer.

MY DEGREE GOT ME THE INTERVIEW.
ARMY ROTC GOT ME THE JOB.

Things got pretty competitive for this job. I'm
sure my college degree and good grades kept
me in the running. But in the end it was the
leadership and management experience I got
through Army ROTC that won them over.

You can begin to develop impressive lead-
ership skills with an Army ROTC elective.
