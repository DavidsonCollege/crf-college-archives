intercollegiate sports
Team members’ attitudes
reflect continued optimism

By CAROLE LOPTSON
Asst. Focus Editor.

Women at Davidson seem
satisfied with the women’s
sports program and optimistic
about its continued improve-
ment and support.

- “I think women here in sports
are doing pretty well,’’ re-
marked Katherine Whitney,
Captain of the Rifle Team.

Since Title IX went into
effect, the College has increa-
singly thoved to improve wo-
men’s sports.

“I could have talked for two
hours last year on how the
College divides things up be-
tween teams — money — but
they really did a lot to straigh-
ten it out this summer. David-
son is certainly getting a lot
better in dividing up facilities
and giving us more money,”
said Tennis Team member Sara
Tatum.

The women’s teams are in
different stages of development.
The women’s participation on
the swim team is uncertain.

Ruth Ann Westervelt, @ so-
phomore swimmer, is optimis-
tic. “Last year a nucleus of girls
didn’t really try to get a team
together. This year we're trying
to get together and talk to some
of the freshmen. Coach Miller
told us if we got a group
together we probably wouldn't
have any trouble getting a
team. If we put the word out, I
believe we could.:I'd like to see

one here.”

The newest team is the
women’s cross country team,
started this year.

One of the organizers of the
team, Paula Kadison, said,
“There’s been enough interest
before this year. The money has

always been there, it’s just the -

interest hasn’t been.”

She continued, “Now we have
a@ core group of-about five girls
who are really interested, really
committed. Of those girls, I’m
the only senior. So there will
definitely be a team—a strong
team—after this year.”

Both the field hockey and the
basketball teams are trying to
stabilize.

“Field hockey was new my
freshman year. We sort of
proved to everybody that we
were really seriously commit-
ted. Last year we learned about
defeat. Our first game this year
is coming up and then we can
really start showing people
what we can do with it,” said
Mary Gray Gilchrist, Field
Hockey and Tennis Team mem-
ber.

Basketball teammate Donna
Ferren felt that ‘Women’s bas-

the sense that we have a regular
coach and she's had an assis-

really helped the stability of the
program.” .
However, Ferren felt, “The
administration and faculty have
not shown much support in

The situation has been helped

_ somewhat with the renovation

of the women’s locker room and
the transfer of two locker rooms
for the women’s teams. Director
of Athletics Thomas A. Cart-
mill estimates that the project
will be completed in 10 to 12
weeks. .

Regarding equipment, Miller
feels that ‘‘we get as much as
any men’s minor sport. Ro-
berts, however, feels that wo-
men’s sports are “‘more minor
than other minor sports—just
in taking care of facilities.”

However, the new thrust of
intercollegiate recruitment cen-
ters increasingly on the athletic
scholarships that the institu-
tions offer prospective stu-
dents.

Miller elaborated, ‘‘Our pro-
blem is that over the past four
years, the athletic. programs at
other schools have been increa-
singly scholarshipwise. When I
first came here’ in the fall of
1974,. we were competing a-
gainst Division I teams in
basketball and tennis.” _

_ With increased competition,
the women’s tennis and basket-
ball dropped from Division I
status. The tennis program now
belongs to Division 2, while
basketball has dropped to third
division.
Yet Field Hockey, according
to Roberts, “‘has been able to
stay competitive because of the

terms of coming to the games.
A lot of people don’t know
about our games. Our games
are usually scheduled at bad
times, like around supper time.
We try to publicize it as much
ag we can.”

Although the women have |
encountered some ridicule or |

felt some uneasiness, they seem
to have dealt with it and
adjusted to it. .

lenwider found, ‘‘At first there

Women mentioned comara-
derie, immediate results, a
change from academics, and the
need for emotional and physical
outlets as main reasons for
participating. in sports.

‘I’m not that competitive,
but it’s good motivation and the
comaraaene of the team is such
good motivation for running,”
said Dubose. .

“In sports, you can really see
the results right away. There's
pressure, but it’s relieved often
enough through satisfaction.
Some people play the piano or
something else. But lots of
people don’t have anything to
get away from academics,”
explained Kirk Cameron, Cap-
tain of the Field Hockey and
Tennis teams and fourth ranked
squash player in national inter-
collegiate comnetition.

nature of the sport and the
students involved.”

“As a member of the U.S.
Field Hockey Association,” she
continued, ‘‘we aré able to
compete against all other mem-
ber schools in the state.”’

But the questions of scholar-
ships for women ‘athletes and
College funding for a major
women’s sport remains.

“We're strongly in favor of.
the College moving towards
integrating women into the
total athletic program and gi-
ving women a fair shake,” said
Ross. “But we don't have a
clear sense of women’s feelings
and over-all problems.”

“Because women are so rela-

tively new and their long-range
needs are highly speculative, we
need to see what kind of women
Davidson attracts without
scholarships," added Ross. ‘‘It
is required that Davidson give
athletic scholarships to one
women’s sport because men’s
basketball is funded,’ she con-
tinued. ‘‘But female coaches
and students are divided on this
question.”

While making their study,
the subcommittee on coeduca-
tion: uncovered another aspect.

“The general attitude is that
once you begin to grant scholar-
ships, there is a greater pres-
sure to win,” explained commit-
tee member Cathy Howard.
“This changes the situation and

many feel that the joy of the
sport is lost when the drive to
win is so intense.”

Cartmill sees the situation
differently. ‘‘Right now the
problem is in seeking the level
of competition the women
would like,” he siad. ‘“‘Over the
next year I think what we'll be
doing is studying our competi-
tion to see just where we want
to go.”

But despite the present inter-
nal troubles, student participa-
tion, according to Roberts, “‘for
the kids involved is all the
same.”

“I have nothing but praise for

athe students involved,” echoed
Miller. “When you're playing
against teams with scholar-
ships, there’s not really much
you can do. Obviously other
schools are doing something if
we're dropping that low.”

Roberts’ reiterated, ‘‘We’re
staying the same and everyone
else is passing us by.”

“I think the President and I
feel strongly that as interest
areas grow, we want to ex-
pand,”’ said Cartmill. “There is
a genuine, and sincere interest

players. The team finished last season with a 5-.-2 record. Hope for
improvement is high as the team faces Catawba in ite first game on

Tuesday.

One major concern of the
women was scholastics.

Cameron emphasized, ‘I
think it would hurt women’s
sports if Davidson started gi-
ving scholarships. Scholarships
would cut down on the number
of women who could play. It
would change the program—the
attitude would change I’m a-
fraid.””

(Gregg Strader)

Gripes, both minor and ma-
jor, persist although the women
seem to feel the experience is
worthwhile.

“What we need is publicity,”
Gilchrist asserted.

Hope McArm of the Tennis
Team concluded, “‘I really think
women’s sports adds a whole
other realm to the Davidson
experience.”
