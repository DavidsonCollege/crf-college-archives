Wildcats sweep doubleheader, improve to 7-5 in SoCon

Staff Writer

The Davidson baseball team
took two of three games in a South-
ern Conference battle against Sam-
ford in Birmingham, Alabama this
past weekend.

The Wildcats dropped the
opening game on Friday 6-4, but
they bounced back on Saturday
with 10-9 and 4-1 wins to secure
the series. With the series, the team
edged closer to that evasive .500
mark; Davidson is now 12-13 over-
all and 7-5 in SoCon play.

Davidson began the weekend
slowly, losing 6-4 on Friday. Pat
Brady ’09 hit well in the loss, fin-
ishing two for four with a home run
and Ian Horkley °11 pitched four
and one-third scoreless innings out
of the bullpen to keep the ’Cats in
the game.

Despite these performances,
Davidson was unable to surmount
the Samford lead and was held
scoreless over the final five frames.
Davidson captured a 10-9 victory
in their first game Saturday.

The team led 10-5 entering the
eighth inning, but had to buckle
down to put away Samford’s late
inning rally and secure the win.

Mike Frongello ’11 earned the
win, tossing one inning of score-
less relief, and Matt Webb ’09 en-
tered the game in the ninth to halt
the Samford rally and save his third
game this year. Webb induced a fly-
out to left and a grounder to second
to finish off the game. Five Wild-
cats had two hits in the first game,
propelling the team to 10 runs on
14 hits. Zach Kayne ’09 set the
tone atop the batting order, going
three for five with two runs and two
RBIs. Kayne propelled a three-run
first inning for the Wildcats, setting
the tone for the rest of the game.

Brady, Chase Fitzpatrick ’09,
Seth Freeman 712 and James Cer-
bie ’12 joined Kayne with multi-hit
games. Brady and Freeman both
went deep to hit their seventh and
fifth home runs of the season, re-
spectively.

The final game of the series was
a pitching battle between Webb and
Samford’s Andrew Jones. Webb
tossed six and one-third innings,
giving up one run on five hits while
his counterpart pitched eight and
two-thirds innings giving up four
runs. “The series win was important

because it showed the resiliency of
the team and gives us momentum
for the next couple of series” Zach
Kayne ’09 said.

Samford drew first blood in
the game, going ahead 1-0 with a
home run to left field in the bottom
of the sixth. That was the last run
Samford earned against the tough
Davidson staff.

The Davidson bullpen combi-
nation of Mac Read ’11, Frongello
and Matt Sliwiak’’11 shut out Sam-
ford over the final two and two-
thirds innings.

Not one Davidson batter man-
aged a multi-hit game in the night-
cap. The first Davidson run came
in the eighth inning after Graham
Chapman ’09 singled to second
base and Kayne sent him home
with a two-run home mn. Kayne’s
bomb gave Davidson the lead for
good.

Calvin Sigelbaum °12 added
a two run single through the right
side of the infield to provide insur-
ance runs in the top of the ninth.

Davidson returns to the dia-
mond today, hosting Gardner Webb
on Stars & Stripes Day at 6 p.m. at
Wilson Field. Stars & Stripes Day
will feature an exciting eating con-
test, taking place on the field. Da-
vidson hopes to continue their solid
SoCon play with a victory as they
also look forward to a weekend se-
ries against SoCon opponent, The
Citadel.

The Davidsonian: There have
been reports that the Southern
Conference is considering mov-
ing the championship tourna-
ment to Charlotte in 2010 and
that Davidson College officials
have been involved in pushing
for such a move. Can you com-
ment on the school’s involvement
and what the prospects for mov-
ing the tournament are?

Coach McKillop: The Char-
lotte Regional Business Authority
has proposed that the tournament
be moved to Charlotte. The South-
ern Conference under the direction
of [Commisioner] John Iamarino,
as well as conjunctive with Jim
Murphy, our Athletic Director, and
Scott Applegate, our Assistant Ath-
letic Director, has been looking at a
presentation from them. And their

Will benefit Malaria prevention group

“Ray FRANCIS
- Staff Writer

On May 3, Davidson Wildcats’
basketball player Bryant Barr °10
will headline a 3-on-3 tournament
in the Baker Sports Complex on
May 3. The tournament will sup-
port Nothing but Nets, an organi-
zation dedicated to preventing the
spread of malaria in Africa.

Nothing but Nets was found-
ed in 2006 by the United Nations
Foundation: It attempts to prevent
the spread of malaria by purchasing
mosquito nets for African families.
Mosquitoes are the primary method
by which the disease is spread. Ma-
laria is the leading killer of children
in Africa and affects 500 million
people worldwide. Because of the
poverty endemic in many at-risk
regions in Africa, it is estimated
that only one in 20 people own a
protective net.

The tournament will be split
into three divisions. The first will
be comprised of third and fourth
graders, the second of fifth and
sixth graders with the final division
to consist of seventh and eighth
graders. The registration fee of $50
pays for five mosquito nets.

As an added incentive, the team

raising the most money in each
division will also have the oppor-
tunity to choose first in a draft of
Wildcat basketball players to serve
as coaches for the teams. The win-
ners of each division will receive
T-shirts from Nothing but Nets as
well as a fly-swatter themed tro-

phy.

Chattanooga again next year. But
it is possible that the tournament
would be moved to Charlotte
next year?

CM: From what I understand
they’re investigating the possibility
of moving it to Charlotte in 2010.
