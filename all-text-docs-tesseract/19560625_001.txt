STUDENT BCDY PRESIDENT
DISCUSSES HCNCK SYSTEM

Davidson College is like numerous other
small liberal arts colleges across the
country in that is hac its tz saditions, its
eccentric prefessors anc all the other vital
facets of college life. Davidson hes its
favlts tno, just as 211 other ecl’cges fall
short of the ideal n--n,

Ecvever, Davidson is blessed with one great
advantage over many < lleges is that it has
a timo-tested Honer System, The Honor
System as incorporated in the Student Body
Constitution has, throua the years,
evolved into a Ge" + of Honor vhich actually
vor.s and is net jus a writton theorem
noucht up by idecly

The Honor Syste written in the Constitution
statos plainly wnat constitutes a violation
of the system, Tha Censtitution provides
for a court - the St nt Council - which
is to try any studont who violates the
Ionor Cade, This Councii has the authority
to render punishment fcr an Honor System
violation, It has the porer to dismiss a
etugent frem college for a violation of the
Coce and this action has been taken by the
Council mcre than once,

In other words a violatica cf the Davidson
Coliege Honor Systen is regarccd by those
students who wohold the principles of
honest;- and integrity, cs a serious and
unarrented betrayal of the Ccllege's trust
in the principles of tho stucont body. It
is the duty ef every stucjont enrolled here
to uohold those basic principles of honesty,
integrity and indcpendcnee which constitutes
what is possioly the mest outstanding facet
the Davidson tr: dition,
