The football team doubled up
Centre, 42-21, ina Senior Day rout
at Richardson Field on Saturday in
the Wildcats’ strongest all-around
performance in years.

The win was Davidson’s first
over the Colonels since 1940.

Witha victory this Saturday at
Bridgewater, the Wildcats would
post their first winning récord since
1993 (6-4).

Quarterback Tommy Dugan
continued his torrid play of late,
completing 9-of-18 passes for 209
yards and picking up a career-high
100 yards rushing.

The junior signal-caller ran
for a touchdown and threw for
another, as the 42 points marked
the most scored by the Wildcats in
three years.

“All week we’ve been look-
ing to the seniors and telling them
we’re going to do it for them,” said
freshman safety Chad Wright, who

ran back an interception for a go-
ahead touchdown at the end of the

second quarter.

“They’ ve been through it all.
So we want to give them a 6-4
season again, and we’re on our
way. ‘
The offense racked up a sea-
son-high 461 yards, including 252
on the ground, and the defense
held the Centre offense to a sea-
son-low 205.

“We've always kind of relied
on defense here, and that’s by de-
sign,” saidcoach Tim Landis. “We
emphasize that. But our offense
has really matured.” .

Starting this season, the
women’s soccer team had ques-
tions about the sweeper position.
This weekend, Katherine Cornelius
provided the answers.

Anchoring a defense which

recorded two straight shut-outs,
Cornelius was named the tourney’s
Most Outstanding Player after
Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Georgia
Southern. The win gave Davidson
its third consecutive Southern Con-
ference championship.

“Every year it feels like we
have to go prove it,” goalkeeper

Allie Noznesky said. “Yes, I would
have liked to put more goals in the
net, but it’s nice. And the best part
is we have 21 of our 24 players
returning to do it again next year.”

maining in the first half, reserve

SGA works toward off-campus rides

By IAN HUMMEL
Staff Writer

Davidson students without
cars have long been under a sort of
house arrest.

In the past, the school has tried
to alleviate the problem through a
program that offers rides to the
airport for students during certain
holiday periods. This year, how-
ever, the school aims to alleviate
the transportation problem through
an expansion of this program which
will include transit to Cornelius or
Charlotte for a variety of student

needs. :

Toaddress this issue, the SGA
formed an ad hoc committee ear-
lier this year for the purpose of
researching and proposing meth-
ods to meet the transportation needs
of Davidson students. In addition,
a Transportation Task Force com-
prised of faculty and students was
formed by Dean Shandley in early

_ October.

The Task Force also seeks to
provide opportunities for transpor-
tation for health reasons, like doc-
tor appointments, and for rides for
job, internship, and class obliga-

tions that draw students off cam-
pus.

According to junior Patricia
Evans, Chair of the Rides Com-
mittee, the program is yet in a
formative stage, with possibilities
and obstacles still being discussed.

Student head of the Task Force
and SGA President Warren Buford
says that a survey will be out in the
coming weeks to assess what the
students feel are the specific trans-
portation needs. At the same time,
research will be conducted to ana-
lyze the rides programs at other
schools. :

Buford says that there are a
few barriers that remain to be over-
come before the program can get
completely underway. Liability
and insurance issues that are ever-
present when dealing with cars,
and the need for a program that is
financially viable will have to be
managed in the coming weeks.

Despite these obstacles,
Buford is hopeful that a pilot pro-
gram will commence in the Spring
semester.

This program, he says, will
not be a “taxi service,” but by start-
ing ”small and realistically.”

According to Dr. Vivian
Dietz, Chair of the Public Lec-
tures Committee, the Jane
Goodall lecture on November
19 in Love Auditorium is caus-
ing a stir. Tickets for Goodall’s
lecture on November 19 are go-
ing fast among Davidson stu-
dents and faculty. Well over 300
tickets were allocated in the first
5 days, beginning last Monday.
“T’ve been receiving up to
ten calls a day since the late
summer,” Dietz says. ‘“Every-
one wants tickets... classes at
Furman, a chiropractor from
Boone, a teacher from Tennes-
see, prenatal chimpanzee work-
ers at the Asheboro Zoo, you
name it.”

The ticket office phones are
ringing off the hook. After the ‘
phone rang for the third time in
five minutes, Union desk worker

ticket office begging me to send
them tickets, saying ‘I’ve been
studying her all my life’.”
Goodall, who lives in En-
gland, is internationally known
for her 36 years of chimpanzee
research at the Gombe Research
Center in Tanzania. Her discov-
eries and methodology revolu-
tionized the field of primatol-
ogy.She also gave human names
toher subjects to distinguish their
individual personalities. After
watching chimp mother “Flo”
spend almost all her time rearing
baby ”Fifi,” Goodall was con-
vinced that human mothers
should do the same for the first
two years of a child’s life.
When Goodall began her |
study in 1960, she had had no
formal training. She now holds a
PhD in ethology from Cam-
bridge. She is the author of six
books, including her best seller
In the Shadow of Man. In 1977, |.
she established The Jane Goodall
Institute for Wildlife Research,
Education, and Conservation.
Goodall last spoke in the
Charlotte area in 1990, when she
lectured at Winthrop. Davidson
is one of the seven stops on her
1996 tour. She will also speak to
