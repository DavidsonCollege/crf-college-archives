Lady Cats Play Tough
Romp To 52-38 Win,

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

“The women’s basketball
team’s strengths this year are
height, intelligence, and good
poise,” remarked Assistant
Wildkitten Coach Joe Duncan
after last Tuesday’s game
with UNC-C. The 14 point
spread between Davidson,
who finished on top 52 to 38,
and UNC-C was the result of a
good defensive game, keeping
the UNC-C cagers to 9 out of
an attempted 43 hoops (21 per-
cent from the floor).

“Offensively, the team was
very steady, but our shooting
was cold, particularly in the
first half,’’ said Duncan.
Kathy Morton led the David-
son drive with 15 points,
followed by Donna Sherrill
with 13, and Becca Stimson
with eight points.

“This was probably not one
of our better games, ” com-
mented Duncan, “especially
in light of the last two, where
we played really well.”’

The women’s basketball
team has recently contended
with Guilford and the er-
stwhile undefeated Southpark
Queens All-Stars. In spite of a
strong showing in both games,
Katie Early feels that, in the
game against the Southpark
Queens, ‘‘we weren't
aggressive for the ball.”’

In the first half ‘‘the All-
Stars were and for-
ced a lot of turnovers,” Early
said. ‘‘We started controlling
the ball during the second half

and were, more, patient oie :tpemdicts Swe; wont: gome’ ay

taking shots.” The All-Stars

left their match and a
devastated Davidson with a
13-1 win/loss record.

Questioned on the team’s
weaknesses, Head Coach Ann
Holland stated that ‘‘they sim-
ply haven't played enough
together. We have a tough
time getting the ball down the
floor.’ Holland also stated,
“we are having a tough time
attacking the zone - we are
passing quicker though.”’

As a result of previous
games, the team is starting to
function as a unit. ‘“‘They are
starting to set picks for each
other - 10 more games and we
would be extremely com-
petitive,” said Holland.

She intends to concentrate
on offensive tactics - fast
breaks and quick ball han-
dling in the next few weeks to
prepare for games —
Pfeiffer, Sacred Heart and
UNC-C.

Holland specifically noted
the women’s proficiency in the
shuffle-cut as their crush tac-
tic on man to man defenses.

FI year’s prospects

are very encouraging,” she
stated. ‘“‘We are losing only
one player.” Team Captain
Dea Booth is a junior and the
other members are all fresh-

men.

It is not standard procedure
for the women’s basketball
team to scout contending
teams. Holland says, ‘‘it
makes them think and keeps
them on their toes.’

With Catawba, the most
competitive team the women
play, behind them Holland

‘other one this season.’

Many as 25 points. A meager
six point lead at intermission
was widened by a 30-11 spurt
in the initial 10 minutes of the
second half.

Led by the aggressive board
play of Larry Horowitz and
Paul Wagner, the Wildcats
had an almost 2-1 margin in
rebounds. Before getting into
foul trouble, Sheldon Parker
contributed some strong work
on the offensive boards, as
well.

Richmond high scorer Aron
Stewart was held to nineteen
points and 7-20 from the field.

Three-Minute Giant Killer

Post-mortems are always
unhappy affairs, especially if
the unfortunate victim is close
to you. In this case the victim
was Davidson, who died sud-
denly last Saturday in South
Bend, Indiana after a heroic
struggle against Notre Dame.

—o game went pretty much

as Notre Dame
took command of the boards
and dominated much of the
game. The game was sloppy
at the start, with Notre Dame
shooting poorly, and Davidson

For the greater part of the
Davidson looked

fact that they were playing the
conquerer of UCLA. The Wild-
cats got off to a fast start, but
‘in a scene reminiscent of the
Duke debacle only four days
previously turnovers led to
strings first of nine, and later
of 11 Irish points.

Despite all the disap-
pointment and aggravation of
watching a favorite team get
beaten, it was all worth wat-
ching to see those last, sweet

good listeners are made,
not born

five minutes. Then the team
was running and hitting, for-
cing Notre Dame into
numerous errors, both of-
fensive and defensive. Now it
was the Irish who looked like
losers.

Basket after incredible
basket was canned as the Irish
lead, once a bloated 17 points,
shrank to only seven in the
space of 100 seconds. With a
minute and a half left, there
was a chance for a tremen-
dous upset.

Then, in a flash, it was over.
The Irish awoke and David-
son, racing against the clock
and pressing themselves in-
to errors, was finished. Notre
Dame put on onefinal six point
spurt and the game was back
in perspective.

But oh that three-minute

burst! It was good to see a
smaller, hustling ballclub give
a national powerhouse all it
could handle if only for a little
while.

I'm sure Digger Phelps
won't soon forget those three
minutes, nor will the Notre
Dame fans. Last of all, I'll
never forget that magical
point in time when, just for a
little while, Davidson was bat-
tling a giant, and winning.
