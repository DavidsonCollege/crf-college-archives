1954, Buttrick has written

quickly, coming as it did out
of the early May meeting at
Montreat.

“We didn’t want to rush
things,” said Fredericksen.
“If you move too hastily, you
frequently make only foolish

“One important accom

tee has given its approva

“Biblical Thought and the
Secular University."

He is currently professor
of preaching at Northwestern
University’s Garrett Theo-
logical Seminary. Buttrick
has previously taught at
Harvard University and
Union Theological Seminary
in New York.

Buttrick, who is 77, will live
in Davidson. .

“We are very pleased that
Dr. Buttrick, a long-time
friend of Davidson College,
will be with us next year.
and look forward to our as-
sociations with him,” Spen-
cer said.

Clodfelter attacked the
committee’s decision to rec-
ommend that no faculty
member be allowed to advise
more than one project. That
may well rule out a lot of
projects which the faculty
members are now willing to
take on,”’ he said.

However, Williams said
that the committee did not
think the’ professors would
have enough time to advise
on more than one project
and -perform their other
duties. .

“We also thought it would
not be ifair to the faculty
members to ask them to put
in so much extra time on
something for which they
would not be paid, particular-
ly on what the committee felt
was a low priority item,”
Williams said.

Restrictions
That Strangle

“The Davidson student is now far better pre-
pared for flexible and challenging programs than ever
before,” according to Dean of Faculty Frontis W.
Johnston, as quoted in the Reference Catalog, Page
14. “The raw material for an exciting intellectual
adventure is on our campus. The task of the future
at Davidson is that of developing the full potential
of such human material.”

Well said.

Now let: the statement be honored. Let the fac-
ulty approve the Experimental College concept in
pilot form for next year. It is just a pilot program,
and is certainly worth a try. .

But it would be unfortunate if the proposal goes
through in the form that the Educational Policy Com-
mittee approved, because the restrictions which the
EPC added to the proposal virtually strangle it.

The program has involved freshmen to a great
extent so far, but the requirement that two area
exams be passed before entering the program elimi-
nates the freshmen.

Stating that the students could not be excused
from “regular academic requirements” is contradic-
tory. The whole idea of ExCo waves aside the concept .
of regular academic requirements. The policy should
read, “The student will be excused from regular
academic requirements as the occasion warrants,
with permission of the faculty board and his major
department, if major requirements are involved.”

However, the proposal becomes laughable at the
point where it reads: “The student will pay full tui-
tion and fees and dormitory charges for four years
even if part of his project takes him away from the
campus.”

So much for scholarship students entering the
program. The cost is prohibitive — and an obvious
money-grab by the college. It is amazing enough that
someone had the nerve to put the proposal on paper,
but the EPC’s approval of it is shocking. With tuition
and fees rising by $200 a year, year after year, an |
additional burden like this is not acceptable.

The basic concept is just what Davidson 1:eeds,
but a pilot program with restrictions like these will
go over like a Jead balloon.

The faculty could well improve the proposal by
a close examination of these restrictions, with an eye
to dropping quite.a few of them when it meets Thurs-

day.

Vote Down
Code Revision

Those revisions in the Code of Responsibility
need to be voted down.

The most serious problem is the rewrite of the
dormitory search section to limit the section’s ap-
plication to college personnel. Students need protection
from an overzealous Investigating Committee just as
much as from snooping security officers. It makes little
difference who plays policeman.

Next, the revisions are simply shoddy work. They
haven’t been thought through and show it. The civil
authorities clause is vague at best, and the statement
on the new Court of Appeals leaves it unclear whether
members continue to serve after they lose Senate
or Faculty Executive Committee seats.

_ Finally, the revisions dodge the two main issues
which they should handle, including one that the
Senate explicitly named to be dealt with: drugs and
campus disorders. Policies on both of these matters
are either inadequate or vague.

° This wii] be too late for the student vote, but
we urge the faculty to refer the code revisions back
to committee Thursday. .
