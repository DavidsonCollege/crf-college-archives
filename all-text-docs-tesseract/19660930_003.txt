Overall Record Is Vital
in Admissions Decision

Graduate schools are more
interested in the general ap-
pearance of an applicant’s rec-
ord than in such individual
factors as undergraduate tran-
scripts and graduate record
examination scores.

“‘A graduate school looks at
a candidate,” said Dr. W. B.
Hight, ‘‘and from his record
tries to answer the question,
‘Can he succeed against. grad-
uate school competition?’ "

Many factors influence the
appearance of a student's rec-
ord. ‘'They look at your under-
graduate academic record, and
at your scores on the graduate
record exam or law exam, for
example. I do think they pay
more attention to those scores
than they say they do,"’ com-
mented Hight.

TAKE EXAM ONCE

He explained that for best
results generally the graduate
record exam should be taken
only once—during. the senior
year.

The exam consists of two
parts—a morning exam which

is a genera! aptitude test—and
an afternoon achievement test
which measures a_ student's
accomplishments in his major
field of study.

The law exam and the med-
ical exam should also be tak-
en once—also during the sen-
jor year. They both consist of
general knowledge questions
and law and medical aptitude
questions respectively.

REPUTATION

“They take extra-curricular
activities into consideration,
but they are Jess meaningful
in these applications than in
applications to undergraduate
schools.”

The reputation of the under-
graduate school attended by
an applicant is important, ex-
plained Hight, who also point-
ed out that often a student
from a college not well rep-
resented at a given graduate
school will be accepted soon-
er than an equally well quali-
fied student from a well-repre-
sented undergraduate college.

Frequently the amount of

financial aid which an appli-

cant says he needs to attend is

a factor, Hight added.
RECOMMENDATIONS

He explained also that rec-
ommendations figure promi-
nently in the decision of an ad-
missions committee, for a
graduate school can often ac-
curately judge a candidate for
admission from the reputa-
tions of those people who rec-
ommend him, and also from
the enthusiasm or lack of en-
thusiasm with which the let-
ters are written.

A final factor mentioned by
Hight is the desire of a stu-
dent to attend a particular
school-

“Sometimes this can be im-
portant,’' said Hight, who con-
eluded that all the information
a graduate school has about
an applicant is important, and
sometimes seemingly unim-
portant factors make a differ-
ence between acceptance and
rejection as ‘‘strange things
happen in admissions commit-
tee meetings.”

MILLIONS LEFT UNCLAIMED

By KERN PARKER

Financial considerations are

no real obstacle to any compe-
tent student desiring to attend
graduate school, according to
Dr. William B. Hight, direc-
tor of student counseling.

“If a student is good
enough,”’ said Dr. Hight, ‘‘he
can receive financial aid from
one of several sources.”

Hight pointed out that last
year colleges, universities, ed-
ucational foundations, corpora-
tions, charitable groups, pri-
vate citizens and governmen-
tal agencies awarded over one-
half billion dollars in non-re-
payable stipends, and over one
billion dollars in low-interest-
rate loans.

UNUSED STIPENDS
In addition, more than $30

million in unrepayable stipends
and more than $500 million
dollars in low-interest rate
loans went unclaimed.

“The money's there,’’ Said
Hight, “and we've been build-
ing up our library in the guid-
ance office so that our stu-
dents can learn where to get
it. Right now we've got cata-
logs of “more than 400 grad-
uate schools."

Hight said that. graduate stu-
dents want financial help for
two reasons: because they
need it and because it's pres-
tigious to have it.

TWO FACTORS

Hight said that a decision
by a school or foundation to
award a graduate student fi-
nancial aid is based primarily
on two factors, with a third
being important jin borderline
cases.

The two main factors are
rank in class (grade average)
and Graduate Record test
scores. The third factor,
professor recommendations,
makes the difference when a
a decision is ‘real close.”

SOURCES OF AID
The graduate schools them-

selves offer three sources of
financial aid, independent of
private foundations: (1) fel-
lowships—money of their own
that they give as they desire;
(2) low-interest-rate loans, oft-
en drawing on funds made
available by the federal gov

ernment: (3) assistantships—_

programs under which the stu-
dent is paid for the work he
does for a college (teaching,
paper grading, serving as a
lab assistant) while continu-
ing his studies.

Under an assistantship, a
student will usually have as
many of hours of work per
week as he has hours of class-
es. :

The Davidson College Cata-
logue boasts to prospective ad-
mittees that over 70 per cent
of each graduating class even-
tually winds up in some sort
of graduate school.

That is to say, Davidson stu-
dents do not graduate in the
ordinary sense of graduating,
but in the extraordinary sense
of becoming college graduates
who are graduating into a
graduate school.

Unfortunately, however. Da-
vidson offers no course in the
art of surviving graduate
school. To dispel some of the
mysterious aura enveloping
this higher form of education.
several younger members of
the faculty offered their views
of graduate school and what
the Davidson student can ex-
pect.

Hansford Epes, currently
teaching German as well as
working toward his doctorate
at UNC, emphasized that the
major differences between Da-
vidson and graduate school re-
sult from their design to per-
form different jobs.

“The aim of a graduate
school,” said Epes. ‘‘is to give
professional training—whether
it be as a teacher, doctor or
lawyer. Davidson's aim is to
give a good broad, liberal ed-
ueation.”

Epes denounced the present
structure of graduate educa-
tion because, as he said,
“Graduate schools are rare
that include in their program
work that is directly related
to the needs of classroom
teaching.

“The orientation
‘scholarly research’

is toward
which

gives a deep knowledge of the
subject. This is the teacher's
first need, but not his only
one.”*

Epes vented his wrath. most-
ly against the doctoral disser-
tation. “This thesis.” he add-
ed, “is known somewhat ro-
mantically as a_ contribution
to learning. All too often it is
really a lengthy exercise in be-
laboring the pointless.”

On the subject of professors,
Epes classified his graduate
teachers “more learned, but
less inspiring.” “Their goal,"
he explained, ‘is not to inspire
and teach.

“In this slightly phony ‘teach-
ing vs. research’ dichotomy,
their concern is with research.”

Epes emphasized that he is
not chasing after some semi-
literate dilettantism, nor is he
belittling research. His com-
plaint is with the rigidity of
the system in graduate educa-
tion, its archaic requirements
and the length of time "eat it
takes.

Norman Johnson, history in-
structor, has done graduate
work at both UNC and Johns
Hopkins. He found the major
difference between Davidson
and graduate school to be the
amount of freedom.

“At Hopkins,"’ he explained,
“I was asked what field I was
in and assigned three classes.
I was not required to attend
any of them and had to take
the final exam in only one.”

In his seminars he was de-
manded to show a high degree
of individual initiative and a
high standard of performance.
Johnson added that he feels
his preparation at Davidson
was excellent, particularly in

f

his major. ‘

Leroy Percy, who recently
joined the English department
after completing graduate
work at Cambridge, comment-
ed on the differences between
American and English grad-
uate schools.

“The graduate work in Eng-
land," said Percy, “‘is dia-
metrically opposed to that in
America. All work is done in-
dependently, and one meets
only occasionally with his su-
pervisors.

Discuss Graduate Work

“You are handed a stack
of books and told to read them.
The idea,’ Percy went on, ‘“‘is
that by this time students are
mature enough to keep their
own noses to the grindstone.
Americans, however, used to
academic pressures, often go
wild.”

‘“T enjoyed every minute of
graduate school,” added Per-
cy. “All the instruction is
there. It is merely a matter of
your taking the initiative to go
get it.”

“Good schools try to make
their money count.” said
Hight. ‘They try to draw the
best students that they possib-
ly can. That's how they build
their reputations."

FEWER LOANS

“As a rule.” he continued.
“‘a college will give out more
in fellowships than ‘in loans.
For some reason. graduate
students don't seem to like to
borrow money.

“A Jot of them end up mar-
rying school ‘teachers, which
is really an excellent way to
smooth over financial prob-

Many business firms often
will finance a graduate stu-
dent's education. These agree-
ments in nearly all cases are
in no way binding on the stu-

DAVIDSON ASSISTS

Davidson offers all her in-
terested students assistance in
selecting graduate schools and
in applying for financial aid,
Hight said. The faculty com-
mittee on graduate fellowships,
chairmaned by Dr. George Ab-
ernathy, has been especially
helpful in this area.

Hight emphasized that the
best thing for a student inter-
ested in graduate school to do
is to come to the guidance of-
fice and take advantage of the
growing library of graduate
school information.

‘KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNOWS’

Dr. Puckett Knows

F aculty, Independent Surveys
Help Students Pick Schools

By BOB TRAVERS
Managing Editor

An undergraduate can find
very good indications of the
caliber of a graduate school
in the opinions of his profes-
sors as wel! as through inde
pendent studies published by

educational foundations, ac-
cording to Dr. William B.
Hight.

The latter, summiaries of the
faculties, effectiveness of pro-
grams, and reputations of
‘graduate schools are available
for Davidson ‘students’ use in
the student counseling office,
said Hight. ‘‘We order copies
of these studies as soon as they
are published.”

“But: don’t use a
source,’ he warned. °’Profes-
sors generally are familiar
with the graduate schools in
their respective fields: you
should consult the school's cat-
alogue and students attending
that. school. From these you
can get a pretty realistic view
of an institution.” ,

Dr. W. 0. Puckett, professor .

of biology and advisor to pre-
med majors, indicated that
the same is true. for medical
schools.

“I don't think you can tell
how good a med-school is
from its catalogue."’ he said.
“You have to know someone

single

who knows.”

A graduate school catalogue
can tell. only so much. Hight
explained, but
should check. it, especially to
get a picture of the faculty.

“AN members of a good
graduate school faculty will
have the PhD degree—where
they got their degrees makes
a difference”

The reputations of faculty
members in. their respective
fields are also important, but,
Hight pointed out, ‘those fac-
ulty members engaged in writ-
ing and ‘research frequently
area't doing much teaching."

The adequacy of library,
Jaboratories .and other fa-
cilities are an important con-
sideration—a good indication
of their completeness is the
school’s reputation.

“There generally are no un-
deserved reputations.”’ Hight
continued, ‘‘but neither is a
given department likely to. re-
main consistent over a num-
ber of years due to a. turn-

an applicant.

over in faculty members.”’

“Furthermore, a profession-
al or graduate school may be
better than or not as good as
the university of which it is
a part. You must pick the
professional school or the de-
partment, not the university.”

“In the basic four-year sci-
ence course,"’ Puckett con-
tends, ‘‘all medical schools are
teaching about the same things.
For the basic four-year pro-
gram, I wouldn‘t trade a small
one for Harvard.”

“Where a student has to be
careful is where he has his in

ternship and/or residency.”

Other considerations in judg-
ing both med-schools and grad-
uate schools should be whether
or not. the type of school or.
-academic community. is what
the applicant is looking for
and will be happy in. Hight
continued.

In addition, whether or not
he thinks he can get good
financial aid from a_ given
school should be a. major prac:
tical consideration in his eval-
uation of the school and wheth-
er or not he should apply for
admission to- it.
