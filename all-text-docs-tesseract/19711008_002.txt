Peace Coalition Wednesday by offering for sale 10 paintings and
six drawings. Although the works were underpriced, Coalition

helped the Moratorium effort.

Co-Curricular Council Seeks
Social, Cultural Coordination

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

There is presently a facults
constitution revision recommen-
dation being considered which
will have far reaching effects
on the social and cultural life
of Davidson students.

It is being proposed that a
Co-Curricular Education Board
be established which will plan.
coordinate, and implement. a
campus program of public lec-
tures, art presentations. and
special events such as the big
weekends.

During academic vear 1970
1971 there were 140 cultural and
academic presentations spon
sored by 12 groups.and organ-
izations.

The average attendance at
these events was 126, and the
average cost per performance
was $239.65 or $2.01 per person.

In other words. the 140 per-
formances were attended by i
total of 16.670 at a total cost of
$33,552. This is not to imply
that these were 16,670 differen’
people. Also, a lecturer may

Planned To Replace IFC

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

Student Body Vice President
Bill Alexander is currently in
the process of establishing an
Inter-Eating Club Council to re-
place the now defunct Inter-
Fraternity Council.

The Inter-Eating Club Coun-
cil will consist of the presidents
and treasurers of each of the
ten houses now on the court.

“Of course there will be no
rush, and the College’s policy
in regard to the court has been
established for the most part,”
said Alexander.

“I have spoken with Dean
Terry about the function of the
IECC, and it appears that he

commented Alexander.

Alexander indicated that once
the Inter-Eating Club Council
is established it will have ex-
panded powers. Dean of Stu-
dents Will H. Terry will retain
veto power over the actions of
the IECC, and the IECC could
not contradict the policy of the
College, Alexander said.

The Inter-Eating Club Coun-
cil will have at its disposal
$10,000 per year. These will be
funds provided by the College,
and they will be used to main-
tain the buildings and grounds
of the court. Alexander indicat-

Four sub-committees will be

Bevan. He continued, ‘With
greater coordination we hope to

Student Government Associa
tion President Danny Clodfelter,
though agreeing with the bas-
ic idea of the Co-Curricular Ed
ucation Board, does not believe
social activities and educational
ones should) compete for the
same funds.

“Social and educational pro-
grams provide two distinct types
of functions,” Clodfelter said.
“Up to this time the College
Union has done a good job of
coordinating the social activities
for students. and I see no rea-
son to change this,” he added.

Clodfelter pointed out that it
appears that most of the money
for the budget of the board will
come from student social fees.
There is the possibility that the
lecture series might benefit at
hae expenses of the social life

of students.

Alumni Maintain Status Quo

By THOM NICOLL

Davidson alumni recently re-
elected three incumbents to re
main on the Board of Trustees
as alumni _ representatives,
Alumni Director Howard Arbuc-
kle announced this week.

William White, Jr., president
of Charter Properties, Inc. of
Charlotte, Henry Bahnson, Pro-
fessor of Surgery at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, and Jack P.
Etheridge, Superior Court Judge
of Atlanta, were chosen from a
field of eight candidates by
mail-in ballots.

Attorney Larry J. Dagenhart
claimed the presidency-elect of
the National Alumni Associa-
tion.

Arbuckle termed the twenty-
five per cent alumni response
“typical” and stated that the
results did not indicate any
particular voting trends. Though
student body president Danny
Clodfelter was defeated, the re-
turns did not represent a reac-
tion against the younger candi-
dates, Arbuckle said.

Clodfelter polled 24 per cent
of the total number of votes
which any one candidate could
receive. Another young candi
date for trustee, Daniel Car-
rell, '63, recevied an impres-
Sive 38.4 per cent.

Bahnoon, who graduated from
Davidson summa cum laude in
1941 and from Harvard cum
Jaude in 1944, is a fellow of the
American College of Surgeons

ind a past president of the So
ciety of Universitv. Surgeons.

Etheridge. a 1949 graduate of
Davidson, is a representative
of Fulton County in the Georgia
General Assembly. He is also
Director of the Legal Aid So-
ciety, and a member of the
Governor's State Crime Com-
mission.

White. class of 1952, served
as national co-chairman of the
Ford Challenge Campaign, and
as president of the
Alumni Association.

Dagenhart is past president
of the Wildcat Club and a mem-
ber of the securities committee
of the Amercian Bar Associa
tion.
