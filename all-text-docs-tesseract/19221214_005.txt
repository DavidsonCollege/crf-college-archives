RELIGIOUS NEWS

REV. MR. JUNKIN FILLS
PULPIT SUNDAY

The sermon Sunday morning was deliv-
ered by Rev. W. F. Junkin, a missionary to
China since 1897, Mr. Junkin graduated
from Austin College in Sherman, Texas, and
Louisville Seminary in Louisville, Ky.

He read as a Scripture lesson a portion of
the first chapter of Romans, beginning with
the 13th verse. He took as his text, Ro-
mans, 1.16, “For I am not ashamed of the
gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth.”

DOCTOR JUNKIN TELLS
OF CHINESE CONDITIONS

Dr. W. FP. Junkin,
was the inspiring speaker at (iy NGG AYE (Ce,
A. services Sunday evening.

missionary to, China,

The meeting was in the hands of the class
of ’24, members of that class taking promi-
nent parts in the exercise. Vic Brown led
while Wallace
Purdy and R. G. White played the piano
and violin respectively. Following the open-
ing songs, W. M. Cox read the Scripture les-
son, after which Albert Hillhouse led’ the
house in prayer. H. O. Moss introduced
Doctor Junkin, extending to him a hearty
welcome to the hill. ;

In his talk, which was about religious con-
ditions in China, Doctor Junkin cited three
verses of Scripture: Acts 17:26, “He hath

sta elle

made of one blood all nations for to dwell
on the face of the earth;” Romans 3:23, For
all have sinned, and come short of the glory

‘of God” and Acts 4:12, “For there is none

other name under heaven given among men
whereby We must be saved.”

The speaker called to mind the fact that
China looks to America as the Republic of
the West and is trying to make itself the
Republic of the East. Chinese students come
to American Universities for their educa-
tion. While here, many of them find the
Truth, and hasten to their homes to bear
the good news. They are conscious of a
Savior. In closing, the speaker made a
strong appeal for workers to carry the great
news to that country.

Doctor Junkin has been* a missionary to
China for 30 years, and is in America now
on a year’s vacation. During his work in
China he has been intimately associated with
Mr. and Mrs. Patterson, and Dr. and Mrs.
Bradley, the parents of three Davidson stu-
dents, all of whom are preparing for work
in that great field.

missionary are doing itinerant evangelistic
work in three counties of Kiangsu provinee

class,” he said.

The Freshmen will have the right to ex-
press its opinion on this matter, but, ac-
cording to a ruling of the student council,
they will not be allowed to vote with the
rest of the student body. They will take a
among themselves that will determine
their opinion on the subject.

And next Monday, if the student body
accepts this proposition, the court of con-

April 15th. After that time has passed, it

hold office for the year. It will be the duty
of the judge to appoint attorneys for the
prosecution and defense in every case
brought up. These attorneys will be ap-
pointed in time to give them opportunity to
investigate each charge, and to present the
true details to the court. Any shipping of-
fense will be referred to the student coun-
cil as heretofore.

On Saturday morning, at a meeting of the
Freshman class, Bascomb Sorrells and Leon-
ard Dick explained the court more thorough-
ly as to how it would affect the first year
men. The talks of both men were favorable
to the adoption of the court. Sorrells said
in part: “Some say that stopping hazing will
stop Davidson spirit. Davidson spirit has
to grow on a man and can’t be beat into
him. No proposition can argue against the
good of stopping hazing.” He mentioned
the spirit of the school and complimented
