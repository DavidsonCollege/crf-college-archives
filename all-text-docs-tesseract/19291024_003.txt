BROCK KICKS GOAL

Side Line Shots

By P. R. Alderman

Davidson's brilliant victory over The
CitadelJast Saturday witnessed the end of
half of the 1929 football season for the Wild-
cats and their last game before foes of
the Big Five are to be met. Day after
tomorrow the Wake Forest Deacons will
furnish the first opposition to the Cats in
the State Championship Race, then an in-
terval of one Saturday on which day the
strong V. M. I. Cadets will be seen in
action again the Red and Black machine
on Richardson field.. After this Monk
Younger and his cohorts will have their
hands full with State, Carolina and Duke
successively. This is not to say, however,
that Wake Forest and V. M. I. aren’t to
be seriously reckoned with first, but the
last three contests will undoubtedly prove
the harder tests to the Wildcats in view
of their weight on the State Champion-
ship title.

Before the present Wildcat eleven
was first seen in action and even
through the first game or two there
was quite a bit of doubt and specula-
tion, both locally and abroad as to its
strength and ability. With each of the
five games already played, however,
this indecision has gradually given
way to a general conviction that this
eleven can not be counted out until
the final whistle of the final game, if
they are to be counted out at all. To
further strengthen this fact, the Wild-
cats, without the services of Brohard
and McQueen, two stellar backs, held
the Army Cadets to a two-touchdown
victory and then staged the now-
famous comeback last week to defeat
the Citadel Bulldogs 7-6. As to their
fight — well; they’ve broadcast that
fact better than words ever will.

A brief survey of results so far this
season, considering the teams that have
been met, is undoubtedly far more favor-
able than would ever have been predicted
beforehand. Three of the five’ games play-
ed have been and
scored on every opponent so far, which
indicates the power of the Wildcat of-
fensive, especially as the Arthy, Clemson
and Citadel were among these. The follow-
ing comparative figures supplement these
facts:

Captain Brock, by place-kicking 7 goals
out of 8 tries, has proved his right to the
title of the best in this field in North
Carolina and has so far made a record that
is seldom equalled and scarcely ever sur-
passed.

It seems that the Cats are out for
revenge this year, having settled old
debts with Wofford and Citadel, and
so that puts the Deacons in line for
a tough time Saturday. They should
not offer as much opposition as Cita-
del did but there'll be plenty. The Bull-
dogs brought one of the hardest-
fighting elevens ever seen in action on
Richardson field. They fought a hard,
clean game, completely outplaying
Davidson in the, first half and losing
only after they ‘had put all they had
into the game. It was a battle of two
well-matched, scrappy elevens, every
man on each team deserves praise,

for they all played like men. But

that’s over now and the thing upper-
most in thought now is the scrap
with the Deacons, which, in spite of
all dope and forecasts, is going to be
a hard day’s work for both teams, so
let’s go over and back those Wildcats
like such a team ought to be backed!

A gamely fighting Davidson Wildcat turn-

urday after Being outplayed almost three
quarters and, with a beautiful passing at-
tack, snatched a victory from seemingly cer-
tain defeat.

It was not the desperate kind of a passing
game, a game resorted to only as a last
measure, but it was an attack that is cer-
tain to bring results at any time. That pass-
ing attack, and some hard running backs
give the Wildcats one of the best offenses
that the team has ever boasted.

After being outplayed, and having to fight
with their backs. to the wall for two and a
half quarters, Davidson took a Citadel kick-
off and, following a beautiful return, opened
up on their opponents. Joe McCall ran the

kickoff following the Citadel touchdown back |

to his own 43 yard line, After a line play

and a pass had failed to gain, Brock stepped
back, and from a punt formation, shot a
perfect pass to McCall, who was downed on
the Citadel 30 yard line. It was first time
Davidson had had the ball in their opponents’
territory the entire game. Brock passed again
to McCall, but made only five yards on the
play. Then Fraley took the ball, and passed
to Proctor, who took the pass on the five
yard line, and stepped the remaining distance
