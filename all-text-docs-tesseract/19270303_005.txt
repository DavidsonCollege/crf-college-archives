THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 3, 1927

Seven Summer Camps to be Held in

Fourth Corps Area During Vacation

The War Department will operate seven
Citizens’ Military Training Camps in the
Fourth Corps Area during the summer of
1927, for the training of young men between
the ages of 17 and 24 years. These camps
will open on June 15 and close on July 14,

1927.

Four thousand young men will be selected
to attend these camps from the Fourth Corps
Area, which comprises the states of Tennes-
see, North Carolina, South Carolina, Geor-
gia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louis-
jana.

The Army Posts where these camps will
be established and the number of young men
to be trained at each camp are as follows:
Fort Barrancas, Florida, 500 Coast Artillery ;
Fort Bragg, North Carolina, 500 Field Ar-
tillery; Camp McClellan, Alabama, 900 In-
fantry; Fort McPherson, Georgia, 500 In-
fantry; Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, 300
Infantry; Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, 750
Cavalry ;. Fort Screven, Georgia, 150 Infan-
try.

On account of. the limited amount of funds
for transportation the young men selected
for these camps will be assigned to the camps
nearest their homes.

The graduates of the White Course whio
have been recommended for the Blue Course
in the Field Artillery, Cavalary and Coast
Artillery, will be sent to the camps where
last trained.

All young men between the ages above
designated who canp ass the required physi-
cal examination, and are of good moral ‘char-
atter, as certified to by some prominent and
reputable citizen who is personally acquainted
with the applicant, are eligible for selection
for these camps. In case the applicant is
under 21 years of age, the consent of his
parent, guardian, or nearest relative is re-
quired.

The purpose of these camps is to assemble
ambitious young Americans for 30 days an-
nually, and to train them in citizenship, self-
reliance, initiative, good fellowship, moral
and spiritual conduct, and how to work hard
and efficiently. The moral and religious in-
fluences of these camps are kept at the very
highest standards. Attendance at these
camps constitutes no obligation of future
military service.

Scholarships to leading universities, col-
leges and preparatory schools throughout the
United States are awarded annually to young
men attending Citizens’ Military Training
Camps.

These camps were inaugurated by the late
President Roosevelt. They have been spon-
sored and endorsed by Presidents Wilson,
Harding and Coolidge, and by the leading
churchmen and educators of the United
States. The sons of Presidents and of labor-
ers and farmers all have an equal chance, and
eat, drill, and bunk side by side.

The mornings are devoted to military train-
ing, calesthenics and instruction. in citizety-

ship, hygiene, first aid and markmanship.
aside for

wrestling,

Afternoons
baseball,

are set athletics,
swimming, tennis, etc.
Every man must compete in some form of
athletics. Candidates in the Red, White and
Blue courses receive instruction in advanced

‘subjects during a part of the afternoons.

The evenings are devoted to vesper .sé¢rv-
ices, moving pictures, dances and entertain-
ments.

The Government furnishes all expenses,
including travel from home to camp and re-
turn, camp facilities, food, clothing, medical
attention and laundry.

While there is no military obligation re-
quired, by attendance at camp, the camps are
a part of the National Defense Act, and their
primary’ mission is to build up the manhood
of the nation, on which, in a national emerg-
ency, the preservation of our institutions will
rest.

tour concerts will be given in Columbia,
Greenville, Spartanburg, and Gastonia. Full
arrangements for the jaunt have not been
completed, but will be announced later.

Several one night engagements are being
arranged for the latter part of the month
and the first of April. These concerts will
be given at Mooresville, Lenoir, Statesville,
Denver.

An interlude with Val Guthey and J. S
McAlister as the actors has been arranged
to add spice to the program. This skit is a
reversion of the one presented at Davidson
earlier in the year which proved a huge
success.

New Theatre Opens
in Charlotte Soon

The Publix Theatres Corporation, which
controls 500 theatres throughout the
United States, will open the doors of the
Carolina Theatre,’ the finest ‘in the Caro-
linas, on Monday evening, March 7th.

This will be the largest and most beautiful
theatre in both North and South Carolina.
It is decorated and furnished in Spanish
Renaissance design. The minutest detail has |
been carefully copied from the works of the
master craftsmen”of this period. No effort
has been spared in installing every known
comfort in the theatre world, for the many
thousands of patrons who will enter its doors.
The Publix Theatres has a high staff of ex-
perts, who are paid enormous salaries, to
study, create and supply hundreds of com-
forting conveniences, that are not found in
any theatres outside their circuit.

One the unique lobby patterned
after a Spanish patio, which leads into an im-
mense foyer on the orchestra floor. Here you
are greeted by a specially trained service
staff, who are always on the alert to handle |
the largest crowds with the greatest courtesy
and efficiency. On either side of this grande
foyer are two immense wide stairways lead*
ing up to the loge and balcony seats and the |
spacious lounging room, public telephone
ladies’ rest and cosmetic rooms, and
gentlemen’s smoking room. These have been
luxuriously furnished with over ten thousand
dollars work of furniture, tapestries and,
draperies. Here one may wait for a friend
or relative in the utmost comfort imaginable,
even on the hottest days, for The Carolina
has the only refrigerated air cooling system
in any theatre between Washington and At-
lanta, Ga. Huge refrigerating machines will
be at work at all times, dehumifying the dust-
laden, hot city air to just the desired degree
for absolute comfort and healthful stimula
tion. This innovation alone should prove to
the public what a marvelous theatre Charlotte
will have. The space between the rows of
seats has been made extra wide and the seats |
are unusually large, insuring more comfort
for the patrons, while they are watching the
performance.
