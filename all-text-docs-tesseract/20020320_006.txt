The ABC network will air the 74" Annual
Academy Awards this Sunday at 8 p.m. It
marks the pinnacle of the awards season,
ending the most holy time of the year for film
dorks. Whether you decide to sit in your
hall’s lounge with a bowl of Orville or to sit
in yourroom with a bowl of greenery, Sunday
night should provide a few laughs, and if not
that, at least something to talk about on Mon-
day morning. Then again, you could avoid
the evening’s events altogether, not a bad
choice given the Rivers girls.

So who’s going to win? Who deserves to
win? Nearly every television news program,
talk show, magazine, and newspaper has their
own predictions and desires, so why not us?

In the Best Picture category, The Lord of
the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring will
win, though Gosford Park is the best nomi-
nee, and Mulholland Drive, my favorite movie
of the year, should have been nominated. The
buzz right now is around Moulin Rouge, but
I think LOTR will triumph over the musical
and A Beautiful Mind: Oscar likes big, grand
movies, no matter how good or bad. Case and
point: Gladiator’s win last year. ~

While I think that LOTR will be named
Best Picture, my guess is that Ron Howard
will receive the directing honors. The Acad-
emy owes him for Apollo 13, for which he
was not nominated. Ridley Scott’s work on
Black Hawk Down was the best of any direc-
tor this year. It’s nice to see the director of the
year nominated, and it would be even nicer to
see him win, but that is highly unlikely.. Look
for Richie Cunningham to be behind the
podium on Sunday night. Also, Patrice
Leconte should have been nominated for The
Widow of St. Pierre.

The best actor race comes down to Russell
Crowe and Denzel Washington. Crowe is
Hollywood’s bad boy, but that doesn’t make
him abad actor. Washington is Hollywood’s
nice guy, and one of our best actors. But
Crowe will win. His film, A Beautiful Mind,
is a better than Washington’s Training Day,
and that’s all the edge Crowe needs. I feel that
Tom Wilkinson (Jn the Bedroom), however,
gave the best nominated performance, but his
chances are slim. It’s a shame, too, that
Daniel Auteuil wasn’t recognized for The
Widow of St. Pierre.

Many believe that either Sissy Spacek (Jn

Mind and Rings likely to win

the Bedroom) or Halle Berry (Monster’s Ball)
will win best actress honors, but I think Spacek
has a lock on this category. She’s well
respected, and her In the Bedroom perfor-
mance is a comeback of sorts. Personally, I
do not understand the universal praise for
Spacek: her role is more of a supporting one,
and it seems that all she does is smoke and
break plates. Critics talk about the rage she
gives her character; I see no rage, only a
mature actress on the fast track to emphy-
sema. Don’t be mistaken: Spacek is not bad,
she’s just not Oscar worthy. The perfor-
mance of the year — the best performance of
any man or woman, supporting or leading —
was Juliette Binoche’s in The Widow of St.
Pierre. She was recognized, wrongfully, for
her adequate performance in the mediocre
Chocolat last year. In Widow, Binoche is
stunning, transcending her somewhat implau-
sible material and bringing it to reality.

Berry won’t win. Washington won’t win.
Will Smith (Ali) definitely won’t win. Two
of these three actors probably deserve to win,
but they won’t. What gives? Quite simply,
it’s not because they’re black, but because
there are other valid choices out there this
year. And anyway, the discriminated won’t
go unnoticed. Ian McKellan, an outspoken
advocate for gay rights, will get the “victim”
Oscar for his supporting role in LOTR. His
fellow knight Ben Kingsley, however, is the
best in the category.

As for the supporting actresses...Jennifer
Connelly should have been nominated last
year for Requiem for a Dream. She will win
this year for A Beautiful Mind, and she de-
serves the Oscar. The critical praise she has
been receiving is long overdue. Helen Mirren
and Maggie Smith of Gosford Park and Marisa
Tomei of Jn the Bedroom may sneak in and
win, but I think Connelly has the best chances.
Elpidia Carrillo’s overlooked performance in
Bread and Roses was the best of the year.

So what are we to learn from these predic-
tions and opinions? First, it’s unfair to say
that the Academy would choose gay knights
over black actors; I do think that it is fair to
say that some sort of political-minority state-
ment will come out of this year’s Oscars, if
there hasn’t been one already. Second, when
in doubt, go with A Beautiful Mind. Third,
rent The Widow of St. Pierre. Fourth, they
should just let me choose the nominees and
winners. -

The first Nobel Prize for Literature
awarded to an African went to Wole Soyinka
of Nigeria in 1986. Primarily a playwright,
Soyinka has also written poetry, essays and
directed theatre. A few weeks ago, Soyinka
was the guest of honor in Charlotte’s Mov-
ing Poets’ performance
of “The Echo.” This
original production was
inspired by the .
playwright’s The Man
Died: Prison Notes of
Wole Soyinka, a nonfic-
tion book which re-
counted his two year im-
prisonment during
Nigeria’s Biafran War.

The performance was
made possible by The
Echo Foundation, a Char-
lotte-based nonprofit or-
ganization, and the Mov-
ing Poets Theatre of
Dance. The Echo Foun-
dation helps shed light on
critical human rights issues by interrogating
instances of injustice and encouraging dig-
nity and moral courage. Nobel Laureate Elie
Wiesel gave the Echo Foundation’s inaugu-
ral program in 1998, “Against Indifference.”

Soyinka, once a political dissident, now
an active freedom fighter, was a fortunate
addition to the Foundation’s program.

Soyinka was most outspoken politically.

during Nigeria’s Biafran War, 1967-1970.
Soyinka was in favor of the Biafran succes-
sion from Nigeria and, amidst the mass
violence that ensued, was thrown into 25
months of prison without trial. He spent
almost all of it in solitary confinement where
his anxiety, fear, and spiritual transforma-
tion became the text, The Man Died.

“The Echo” began with Soyinka’s recita-

Moving poets in Charlotte

The Davidson College Theatre Department Presents

Steve MarTir

March 20, 214, and 23 at 8 p.m,

tion of four of his poems, read in a robust,
resonating baritone. “We await/The promise
of the rust,” he pledged to his fellow Nigerians
in “Season.” This poem, like many of his
others, is inextricably tied to his political work.

Following, two speakers narrated sections
of his text. A five-piece orchestra accompa-
nied the movement of dancers interpreting the
passages read. The wavering call of a flute
marked the melancholy
dances. Energetic cello,
djembe (a popular African
drum), guitar and various
hand percussions comple-
mented the choreography
expressing the prisoner’s
anticipated emancipation.

With a stage lit by incan-
‘descent red, blue, and yel-
low lights and dancer’s
skin-tight raiment embel-
lished with tattoos of flow-
ers and geometric shapes,
the stage began to mime
Nigerian folklore. A series
of spoken text and inter-
pretive dance narrated the
prisoner’s experiences:
shackled, sweating, starving. In the final read-
ing a guard came to announce the prisoner’s
release. He urges the prisoner, “Try to forget
your time in jail. Consider it just one of those
things that happens in war time.”

But the prisoner did not forget; he wrote a
book. And from the book came the freedom of
speech, movement and expression that had
been utterly compromised by his imprison-
ment.
