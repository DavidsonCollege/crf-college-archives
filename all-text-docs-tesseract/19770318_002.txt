The Department of English
has announced details of the
competition for the 1977 Vereen
Bell Memorial Award for Creative
Writing.

The award which was
created in memory of Vereen
Bell, a 1932 graduate of
Davidson College, carries a
first prize of $50, a
of $25 and a third prize of $10.

The manuscripts will be
judged by Coleman Barks of the
University of Georgia, who will
make the awards and give a
reading ‘of his poetry Tuesday,
April 26th.

Vereen Bell was a ‘“‘tall,
blond, rugged-looking man”’
who wrote about the things he
understood best—nature,
hunting, and the outdoors, “said
Mrs. D. Grier Martin, widow of
the late College President and a
close friend of the deceased
author Bell.

A member of the SAE
fraternity and editor of the
college humor magazine, then
called the ‘Davidson Yowl’’,
Bell was popular with his
friends and had a ‘‘marvelous
sense of humor,’’ Mrs. Martin
said.

Bell had once intended to
become a journalist but, after
graduation turned to the writing
of short stories.

After meeting and working
under the influence of a
prominent writer of the time,
Frederick Litten, Bell sold his
first story to a Sunday school
magazine for $50 and eloped
with his girlfriend back in
Cairo, Georgia.

m then on Bell sup-
po his family through his
position on the editorial staff of
American Boy magazine in
Detroit.

He later returned to Cairo
and devoted himself entirely to

second prize enjoyed

his first book, Swemp Water,
which became a movie starring
Dana Andrews and Ann Baxter.

Centering on life in the.

Okefenokee swamp area, the
book did much to promote in-
terest in that section of the
country.

Bell’s second book again
dealt with things he un-
derstood—country people who
the “sounds of foxes”
and the beauty of hunting dogs..

As was the fate of many
promising young men of his era,
Bell entered the military during
WWII and was killed on a naval
aircraft in the second battle of
the Phillipine Sea.

His family, along with
many friends, later created the
Vereen Bell Memorial Award.
In this way, they hope to en-
courage other young writers
who, like Bell, show great
promise for future literary

achievement.

Juniors Bob Cathey and Bob
Morrison presented a petition
which calls for reallocation of
college funds to support either
community low-rent housing or
a community infirmary.

Cathey and Morrison, who
were inspired partly by recent
editorials on student apathy in
The Davidsonian, base their
position. on the discrepancy
between pressing community
needs and college allocations
for a new radio station and golf
course.

Using the College State-
ment of Purpose as their proof
of misallocation of funds, the
petition calls on the Board of
Trustees to find ways to spend
the college funds ‘‘for less self-
serving projects.”

The primary goal of the
petition is to change the attitude
of, the college as a whole. Cathey
and Morrison hope the attitude
will become less self-serving:

problem has hindered the
Senate in the past, particularly
at the time of the Media Board
appointments. There is a
confusion on details of
parliamentary procedure and
enforcement of the rulings of
Parliamentarian Percy
Badham.

- The Senate voted, on a
motion by Badham and
amended by Nancy Catron
(Watts), to present the idea of
the petition, but not the petition
itself, to students on senate
visitations.

Cathey and Morrison were
encouraged to rework the
wording of their petition and,
depending on student reaction,
to circulate it.

Laws, President Thom Young

Senate approval. Before
granting the money, Young had
consulted with several senators.
The whole Senate condoned the
action.

The symposium on genetics
was sponsored by the National
Academy of Science. Several
senators expressed a desire that
the information gained by
Silver and Weir be shared with
the student body, possibly
through a Biology Society
meeting.
