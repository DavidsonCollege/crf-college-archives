Miscellan

By SCOTT REID
Senior News Editor

There are six candidates in
the four-way race for the
editorship of The Miscellany.
The Miscellany is Davidson
College’s bi-annual literary
magazine.

Mark Armstrong and Chip
Crawford are running as a
team. They want to make The
Miscellany a nationally reco-
gnized literary publication.

“If St. Andrews can put out
a national literary magazine,’’
said Armstrong, ‘‘then I don’t
see why we can’t.

“The New American Review
started with a circulation
slightly larger than the one the
Misellany now has, yet today
it is probably the best new
literature review in the coun-
try.

“We want to immediately
improve the quality of the
copy submitted as much as is
possible,’ added Crawford.
“We want to do more adver-
tising for manuscripts and
make the magazine’s contests
more of a campus event.

“For example, we would like
to make the awards in a
ceremony, as much as that is
economically feasible.

“We would also like to
increase the number of sub-

ty,

scriptions held by faculty,
alumni, and administration
members,’ noted Armstrong.

“Also, between Chip and I,
we know a lot of people on the

Eastern Seaboard who like to.

write. We would notify them

of the magazine’s contests so _

that they could let their
friends know about them.”’’

Wayne Guilledge is an in-
cumbant co-editor of The Mis-
cellany. He feels that his past
and present experiences allow
him to realize the potential
and problems of the maazine.

“When I. came into The
Miscellany I found our contest
notifications were going out to
about 400 institutions, but the
responses were very few,’’ said
Gulledge.

“I purchased a new mailing;
list of an additional 500 names
and have rented out the old
list to a New York firm so as to
make the magazine more self-
sufficient.

“I’m considering setting up
a Miscellany contest just for
Davidson College students. In
the past we have received
more submissions from people

outside of Davidson than from
people here.

“T’ve tried to get more
students to submit materials.
I’ve notified the English Dep-
artment of our deadlines and
specifically went to the
creative writing professor last
year to get him to tell his
classes about them.

“I think The Miscellany
should continue to go to all of
the students. I think enough
of them read it to make it
worthwhile.’’ Concluded Gul-

Cabinet resurrects YMCA,
plans Christmas gift fund

By MARK DEATON
Editor

The new YM/YWCA cabi-
net, before being officially
approved by the Elections
Council, has initiated plans for
the 1975 Christmas Gift fund,
to be collected next week.

An upopposed slate of John
McArthur, president, Mark
Scandling, vice president,
Katherine Morton, treasurer,
and Marcee Morris, secretary
are directing the fund drive as
their first duties as YM/
YWCA officers. They expres-
sed hopes of raising a min-
imum of $2500 for the David-
son Day Care Center.

The four promised a more
active and enthusiastic David-
son Y than that of the past
year.

“T was so hacked with all
the complaints I heard about
the Y, that I just had to run,”
said Morton. ‘‘It’s' going to be
a learning process, but we’re

backed by: enthusiasm and a

touch of idealism,” she said.
“‘We’re even more enthusi-

astic than we look. It’s just

“that we've’ got’ so. much to
‘learn about running the -Y,”’

Morton mainritained .'

“Let’s face it,-the Y has
been pretty much dead this
year,” said McArthur. ‘‘The
four of us wanted to run as a
team'to bring more unified
leadership to the Y this year,
but we’re going to get input
from a lot more than just us
four.’’

McArthur outlined. plans for
a weekend retreat shortly after
Christmas ‘“‘to delineate the
purposes, goals, and roles the
Y can and should play on
campus. The cabinet expres-
sed hopes of many persons
interested in the Y attending.

“We need to do a lot of
work on the programs the Y
has now or those we have
recently had, but I see some

new ideas coming out of the

retreat,’’ said McArthur.

ledge, “I just can’t believe
students aren’t reading it.’’

Dave Skibbens is presently
The Miscellany's Business
Manager. He thinks the main
problem with The Miscellany
at Davidson today is that it
does not receive enough pub-
licity.

“A lot of people here are not
aware when the magazine is
holding its contests,’’ Skib-

bens pointed out. ‘‘By making
people aware of The Miscei-
lany through publicity in The
Davidsonian and over WDAV,
not only will we get more
submissions, but students will
also be more interested in
reading it.

“I don’t feel The Miscellany
at present is exercising the full
potential available to it. We
have virtually no help on the
magazine at this time.

“I think there should be a
concerted and accelerated ef-

- fort‘to“make students aware

that there are unique possi-
bilities here in producing a
literary magazine.

“T have made an effort to
find out. who is reading the
magazine now. I world like to
see us. send out subscription
blanks to students where if
they filled out their name they
would get a copy.

“It would be, in effect, a
poll of our readership. The
money saved by printing
copies only for those who want
them could be reallocated for
other student activities,’’ said
Skibbens.

Running for co-editorship
positions are Tricia Tommer-
dahl and Lillian Gascoigne.
They see a place for prints and
photographs as well as poems
and stories in The Miscellany.

“I think that The Miscel-
lany should continue to be dis-
tributed to all of the students
since they pay for it,” said
Gascoigne who worked on
Inklings (the freshman lite-
rary magazine), edits The
Davidsonian’s “Inside Art”’
and works on the Union’s
Poetry Committee.

“And when prints and pho-
tographs are included in it,

Claiming that. there has people who don’t enjoy poetry

(See MCARTHUR, page 20) will look at them.”

TOMMERDAHL

“Two years ago when I did
some work for The Miscel-
lany,”’ recalled Tommerdahl,
‘I noticed that there isn’t a lot
of student participation. I
think we could solicit in a more
obvious way.

‘‘Maybe we could advertise
in The Davidsonian or run an
article or something. I think
there’s a lot of stuff around
people could submit.

“We could use The David-
sonian’s typesetter and save
money,’’ Gascoigne indicated.
“We have always enjoyed
poetry and we think that it is a
needed way for people to
express themselves. The Mis-.
cellany is a real opportunity
for people to share their feel-
ings with others.”
