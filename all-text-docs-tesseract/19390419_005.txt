Merit Court

Wildcat Troop No. 58 Stages
Presentation Night

Last Friday night at 7:30
P. M, the Wildcat Troop (No.
58) held a Court of Awards in
Philanthropic Hall which was
well attended by parents and
friends of the members of the
troop.

The program was opened with
the presentation of colors and the
Oath of AlJegiance by the entire
troop, which was followed by the
invocation led by Dr. Price Gwynn.

Adding much solemness to the
court was the impressive candle
lighting ceremony. On a_ rustic,
wooden stand were three large
candles, representing the three |
phases of scout life—God, one’s |
fellowman, and one’s self. Behind

these were 12 smaller candles. which
stood for the 12 laws. As
each candle was lighted, that par-
ticular law which the candle rep- |
resented was repeated by some
member of the troop.

The awarding of ranks and merit
badges followed with Dr. Gwynn |
in charge. Those, awarded the rank
of tenderfoot were Tush Stough
Jr., and Roy Burton, Promoted to
the first class rank were Jimmy
Hough and Cloyd Goodrum; ‘to
the star rank, Creecy Copeland and

, Wat Withers.
The following were awarded mer-
