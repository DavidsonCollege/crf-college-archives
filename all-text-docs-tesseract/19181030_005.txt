"R. DOUBLES WRITES
OF ARMY HOSPITAL LIFE

Set. M. R. Doubles, Company C.
who had an operation for appendicitis
recently in the Base Hospital at Camp
Greene, writes very cheerfully of his life
in the ward. His letter follows:

Those who are familiar with the sur-|-

roundings and the atmosphere of a pri-
vate hospital, would be surprised at the
contrast between a private and an Army
hospital. This article is taken from ex-
periences in a ward where there are
nothing but operative cases, so the read-
er will please not get a misconception of
the Base Hospital as a whole.

Patients shift for themselves, as far as
possible, and this necessitates only two
nurses and two orderlies for a ward of
about fifty. In this ward there are
about thirty, and there are only four
who are confined to their beds, In an-
other week there will be none. The pa-
tients are responsible for the cleanliness
of the ward and each one. who is able
physically, has a certain work to do.

Each patient has a bed, table and chair.)

He gets up at Revielle. makes his bed.
and arranges his table and chair for in-
spection. After breakfast the ward is
swept and other general obstacles are
arranged for inspection. At 9 o'clock
the major and O. D. inspect the ward
and patients. After this, the captain,
who is in charge of the ward, dresses the
wound of every patient.

The ‘‘mess” hours are the same as
those of the rest. Breakfast at 6:15 a.
m.; dinner at 11:30 a. m.: supper at
4:30 p. m. Now of course those hours
would never do for us, so we stack up
from the canteen and have another meal
about 8 p. m. Regular army rations
make up our “menu.” We get potatoes,
beans, peas, bread, beef, rice and oat-
meal mostly. Coffee and cocoa to drink.

The spirit of the men in the hospital
is wonderful. You can’t find a kicker in
the whole ward. We -have all classes
represented right in this ward. White
and colored, all realize that Uncle Sam
is with us and-doing his best by us.
Among our number is one from “Sunny”
Italy, one from Poland, a ranchman
from Oklahoma, several college men,
one aviator, a big 200 pound “Darkie”
who has been in several coal strikes, and
says this is the first job he has had that
he couldn't strike on. Every time a new
fellow comes in we joke him about being
cut up, and what a nice box of cold meat
he will make. Every one is called a
“cold-brick.” A “coid-brick”” is one
who is loafing on the government and
drawing his 30 per and doing nothing.
Everyone gets a nickname the first day
in. Following are some fair examples:
“Big Boy. Kaiki. Sidno, Alligator, Irish,
Buddie, Rep and Crutches.”

The time doesn’t hang as heavily as
one might think. We have a Victrola
and it runs from Inspection until Taps.
Everyone has an idea that he is a grand
opera singer, judging from some of the
hollering that is made in this ward.
‘When there is nothing else to do,’ we all
lend a hand and make bandages.

* The writer hears the K. P. bringing
supper, so he will have to “cold-brick”
on this article now.

SGT. M. RAY DOUBLES,
Company “C.”

OH, WHAT?

A funny thing came down the line,
In black and purple checks;
It wore a wrist watch and a cane
And heavy shell-rimmed specks ;
Upon its lip there grew so neat,
A little row of fuzz;
A poodle dog was leading it,
I don’t know what it wuzz.—Ex.
