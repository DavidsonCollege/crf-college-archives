THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1962

(All Unstaned Editorials by the Edttor)

AChallenge ...

In Tuesday chapel a ringing chal-
lenge was thrown down to Davidson
College—a challenge either to rise
with new vitality or to die a quiet
death. That chaHenge cannot. must
not écho briefly. in the marble halls
only to be hushed by the silence that
prevails there.

For that challenge is not only for
Davidson to become a_ high-quality
jiberal-arts college; we think it goes
far deeper: it calls on Davidson to be-
come what it claims to be—a Church-
related liberal-arts college.

We heard Tuesday that the new
humanities course was not the giant
step into the future that we had
dreamed it to. be, but was rather the
first staggering step out from under
the crushing burden of antiquated
ways. New steps must be taken. and
must be taken soon. Davidson must
bridge the gap between the humani-
ties and the sciences. But more im-
portant. it must begin the vaster task
of trying to bridge the gap between
Davidson and the Church.

We think this chasm between the
religious and the academic desperate-
ly needs sincere and thoughtful at-
tention. and we hope, in the next few
weeks. to direct our attention to some
aspects of this frustrating problem.

Last week. Davidson students and
the college spent untold thousands of
dollars for a three-day orgy. Yet Sun-
day night, after that money-bloated
spree, down how many rows did the
collection plate pass upside-down,
empty?

Last week the Vagabonds pre-
sented a religious drama followed by
the first public discussion of real re-
ligious issues so far this year. Why
did this program arise from a
“secular” source? Why have the ves-
pers and chapel programs not been
followed by a similar outburst of con-
cern?

We think that.there is something
badly wrong with a YMCA that has in
the past reached the students only
twiee a year—both times for money.
first for itself, later for a “charitable
cause” picked from a select group of
over-seas sufferers.

We think there is something awry
in a svstem which has to require “‘re-
ligion” two hours a week—on Thurs-
day mornings and Sunday nights.

More important. we think there is
something agonizingly wrong with a
student body which does not care.
which cannot bother even to respond
generously to a Christmas appeal for
a Gift Fund or to attend a voluntary
chapel, let alone actively show Chris-
tian love.

There are voices which have mov-
ed many mouldy things on this campus
—voices and personalities which have
created a respectable dramatics pro-
gram and basketball team. These are
voices which have not been afraid to
criticize and to insist on action.

But where has been the voice of
the Church? Of the Chaplain’s office?
Of the YMCA? Of the various Chris-
tian fellowships? Week after week,
year after year, we hear nothing.

We call on any student who hap-
pens to be able to think, to turn his
mind and, energies to this appalling
tragedy. We call on any student who
can still, somehow pray, to cry out to
the One True God, Who sees behind
the masks and Who split the veil of
the Temple in twain, to call on Him
to shake.the foundations. to break
down these garish, empty facades, and
that, if any tiny fragment of sincerity
and Truth remain, it may shine forth
in all its brilliant light.

But as for now, we only know
that something which once was very
dear and sacred to us, has been pro-
faned by petty rules and mouldy
breath.

Will The Bright New Look Last?

Will the bright new look last? _

The self-winding minds of the
“Scripts and Pranks” staff seem to
have at last struck upon a format for
their timely humor that will not alarm
even the most prudish campus censor.
Enamel-finished magazine paper has
given way to newsprint; questionable
humor has been replaced by pointed
satire. Perhaps the recent appearance
of a hybrid progeny from the leaky
pens of the “Scripts and Pranks” staff
will herald a new era in campus
humor.

By any standard The Danasonian
was a success. To call it humorous
would be an understatement. To term
it funny would be insulting its non-
chalent satire. Perhaps this new-found
interest in creativity wil] spark origin-
al works that can fill the Pages prev-
iously cluttered by second-hand clip-
pings from the “Orange Peel.”

The regular fall issue of “Scripts
and Pranks” is in the offing. We are
only left to wonder if the fresh humor
typified by The Danasonian will be

Shaft Story

Last Saturday the sophisticated
Davidson gentlemen packed them-
selves into Chambers Auditorium and
saw the climax and resolution of a
typical dance weekend story.

The IFC had madly sent off its
invitations only to be shafted several
times. The refusals even took on the
excitment of a real personal tragedy
when Huey Smith gave it to us at the
eleventh hour.

The trouble was that, although
the three-week plot was exciting
enough, most people were dissatisfied
with the ending. You could say it in-
sulted our sensibilities. At least that’s
what we thought.

But you have to go back to the
main plot to ask, ‘Why wasn’t the end
satisfying?’ Granted the whole affair
was unfortunate, how could the end
have been avoided?

‘

replaced by the disarticulated trivia of
previous magazine issues.

Perhaps the success of The Dana-
sonian will express what readers have
been asserting for years .. . with col-
legiate reading taste as it is, no single
campus publication can cater to both
humor and literary devotees. The
Playmate of the Month with her three
pages of vivid. living color has never
been included in the Atlantic Monthly.
Nor does Robert Frost do much writ-
ing for Mad.

It would seem that The Danason-
ian has inadvertantly set the style for
its aged parent. If “Scripts and
Pranks” is to avoid becoming an anti-
climax, it must either confine itself

to good humor or scramble from the’

stones of a’disgruntled student body.

The Danasonian quipped, “You
can’t come home again.” The moor-
ing are broken. So, “Scripts and
Pranks”, you know where you can go.

BR

Money apparently was the chief
motivating force in the matter. The
groups wanted it and the IFC didn’t
have any. ,

At any rate, we are glad to see
that the IFC is already cognizant of its
role in the above and has started the
machinery to see that the shaft story
doesn’t get a rerun. We hope the
yearly budget proposal will pass and
insure us of quality concerts for the
rest of the year.

One thing remains to be warv of
though. We've courted Dame Rock
and Roll twice now and gotten a raw
deal. Both times Huey Smith was in
the vanguard. Seems like the old say-
ing about being “burnt once” wouid
be applicable here.

Even Lester and Earl didn’t do
that tous...

Apathetic Students Spurn
Opportunity For Y Service

BY JOE HOWELL
Chairman, YMCA Community Service

“Well, what’ does the Y do anyway? I signed an
interest card.and nobody ever asked me to do anything.”
The reason the Davidson College YMCA does not do
anything is the fact that the Davidson student. is not
willing ‘to do anything for the YMCA. “Sure,” you say,
“I'd be glad to help if someone would give me something

worthwhile...”

As a response to this popu-
lar attitude, an expansion of
the community service area
was undertaken this year. Ar-
rangements were made to
start the following new pro-
grams in order to help the
community and give the will-
‘ing student a chance to work
for the Y:

1) A new Teen Canteen pro-
gram for the Negroes in the
Davidson community. Six to
eight boys could be used.

(2) Similar supervision of
Negro recreational activities in
Mt. Mourne, Cornelius, and
Mooresville. Fifteen boys could
participate.

(3) Assistance in athletics at
Torrence Lytle Negro high
school. Five boys needed.

(4) A work program in order
to clean up the Cornelius com-
munity center. Fifteen boys.

(5) Organizing and coaching
Pop Warner football teams in
Cornelius. Mooresville, and Mt.
Mourne. Twenty boys.

To complement the boys
already participating in the
YMCA in community service,
this expansion would enable
over 60 more boys to “do
something worthwhile” for
the community. One hundred
thirty-four letters were sent
out to all the boys who signed
interest cards in this area.

A meeting was held for all
those who-desired to participate
and opportunity was given for
those unable to attend the meet-
ing to get in touch with the
chairman.

Two boys came to the meet-
ing. No one contacted the chair-
man.

Such is the predicament of
the YMCA at Davidson. I do not
know of any solution.

THE DAVIDSONIAN wel-
comes letters from any read-
er either in support of or
differing from its policies.
Letters should be typewrit-
fen, double-spaced, and
should not exceed 250 words.

We also will receive long-
er articles, but request that
they be cleared with the edi-
tor.

In order to be printed in
the following issue, letters
should not be received later
than 6 p.m. Wednesday. All
letters must be signed. The
mailing address is Box 218,

For Superb '

Man“ Effort

BY BILL TROTTER
Davidsonian Fine Arts Critic

Comedy does not generate itself the way straight
drama does—it takes a special elan to put the illusion of
spontaniety across to the audience. The cast.of The Man
Who Came To Dinner succeeded in doing this to an

amazingly consistent extent.

Lee Tells About Korea’s
New Look In Education

BY BYOUNG YOUNG LEE
Richardson Scholar

From time immemorial, rev-
erence for scholarship has been
traditional in Korea. But popu-
lar education has never been in
such demand as it is today.
Never before has _ education
been attempted on such a scale
and so earnestly in Korea as
over recent years.

Further cause for gratifica-
tion can be found in the re
newed vigor with which the
Government and the public are
now endeavoring to accelerate
the progress of what has long
been regarded as the best of
government enterprises — edu-
cation. That freedom and justice
require, above all, popular edu-
cation is a lesson Koreans have
taken to heart during the tur-
bulent post-Liberation days of
experimental democracy. The
importance of education, there-
fore, cannot be over-emphasized.

A look back over the bitter
path our country’s educational
system hes traveled in the
past gives much cause for
rejoicing over what it is to-
day. Now in Korea, more chil-
dren are in sehool than ever
before, thanks to the compul-
sory attendance regulation
provided by the Constitution.
Onlv a decade and half ago
children outside the school
vastly outnumbered those who

great questions of life. His an-
swers have never heen siti
facory. but something within
made him keep asking.

The quest for the unknown
is what made man different

from other animals.

At Davidson we are writi-g
a new leaf in history. We are
satisfied with ourselves and
see no reason to continue
raising these questions. We
float immobile on an ocean of
apathy and indifference. The
winds of dissent have been
successfully quieted. Voices
like those of Ervin Duggan,
Or. Robert Lord, and Charley
Reed, are gone and none have
appeared to carry on their
struggle.

Even the freshmen have bow-
ed before powers of conformity
and grades. This class, which is
usually the source of new ideas
and fresh criticism, is following
docilely in the footsteps of their
elders,

We are all comfortably set-
tled in our respectable ways.

Four years of grades, dance
weekends. and fraternities, will

iv. a jcb. and death. It's as

Questions. What good are
they? You can't eat them.
They don’t help to get a better
job. They simply upset people
into wondering about pur-
poses, values.

But without these questions

«the college community withers

Davidson. criticism and dis-
agreement: are tabu. We rest
content on our quiet sea of in-
difference and don’t like to see
the waters stirred.

Davidson is faced with a chal-
lenge which will decide whether

-or not she will be able to answer

the changing demands of socie-
ty. Unless we are mature
enough to ask ourselves ques-
tions and face criticism honest-
ly, our fight is lost.

were enrolled, and those who
were privileged to go beyond
elementary school were in the
small minority; today the
picture is in reverse.

An unprecedented number of
men and women are enroiled at
the nation’s fine institutes of
higher learning, which boast
qualified faculties and modern
facilities. Out of the ashes and
debris left by the Korean War,
modern school buildings have
risen which offer the aspiring
youth their opportunities never
dreamed of before.

These accomplishments have
been made possible through the
work and sacrifice of the Ko-
rean people, the continued co-
operation and aid of the United
Nations after the Civil War and
governmental and private agen-
cies of those individual coun-
tries.

The phenomenal changes in
Korean education to date are
not limited only to the physi-
cal aspects. For the first time
in the history of Korea, a
democratic education has
been instituted with the can-
cept of Hong-Ik In-Kan, “the
greatest service for the bene-
fit of humanity.”

Replacing the semi-feudal
systems of the past, Korea's
modern education today ‘aims at
integrating the character of the
individual. preparing the in-
dividual to live as a useful citi-
zen of a country, to serve in the
development of a democratic
nation, and to contribute to the
ideal of mutual service.

Stil, there ‘is much to do.
More classrooms are needed to

accommodate the increasing
numbers of school age children,
more teachers are needed and
school systems and curricula
need to be revised to better fit
local situations.

Accomplishments in improv-
ing the nation’s education
made by the Government and
the Public in recent years are
encouraging. Following the
Student Revolution, much was
done to eliminate the causes
that hindered the healthy
progress of education in the
past and to pave the way for
future development.

Education makes a _ people
easy to lead, but difficult to
drive, easy to govern, but im-
possible to enslave; and suscep-
tible more to mutual under-
standing than to hostility.

Throughout the history of
human beings, men’s ignor-
ance of each other's ways and
lives has been reflected in
prejudice, suspicion and mis-
trust—attitudes which have
been the basis for differences
that have fed to war among
the peoples in the world.

Hence, the importance of
education for the welfare and
mutual understanding among
peoples cannot be too much
emphasized.

I wish to individuals and or-
ganizations, national or inter-
national, devoted to education,
continued success in their noble
endeavor, again recalling the
great motto of Davidson:
“Alenda lux ubi orta libertas.”

The play itself is not the
kind of thing Dr. Goodykoontz
can sink his teeth into in his

accustomed manner—ié is en-
cumbered with a superfivity
of slick, pat lines, and too
many unconvincing, typed,
smalt character roles. ft is to
his credit that he made the
audience forget these de-
fiencies and concentrate on
nothing more strenuous than
laughing.

The cast was larger than is
usual for a Vagabond produc-
tion, and it had obviously. been
welded into its job well. The
Goodykoontz touch was. evident.
in the little flashes of inven-
tiveness. the sudden sparkles of
stage effect. I wish there were
time and space to credit the
majority of the characters—in-
deed. it would not be wrong to
say the weaknesses were more
inherant in the lines and the
parts than in the delivery and
projection.

tf some members of the cast
must be singled out for es-
pecially fine jobs, the list
must certainly be headed by
Dick Pitts, who played a warm
and properly gruff Sheridan
Whiteside, the highly improb-
able man-about-life who holds
the title role. His portrayal
of a difficult and demanding
part left little to be desired—
when the part called for it, he
could sputter and snarl beau-
tifully, and when the -part
called for a change in tempo,
he assumed a sympathetic
personality that must have re-
quired real work to create
from his mostly fortissimo
lines.

Fairness to the cast would
necessitate going through the
entire program. I can only say.
that their hard work was evi-
dent, and that the director’s de-
termination has once again
biudgeoned into superb shape,
a play which would have been
something less than rewarding
had the spirit been even a little
bit less than it was. A large
hand to everyone involved.

it’s That Time Agaim...

(ACP)—Any time is likely to
be the silly season on the cam-
pus. Just consider some of the
collegiate pranks reported by
John Armstrong in THE COL-
LEGIAN, Fresno State College’

One warm spring day several
years ago a collection of tro-
phies mysteriously disappeared
from a showcase in a fraternity
house at Ohio State University.

Several months later the
house received a letter from a

Catholic bishop in charge of ~

missions in a Latin-American
country, thanking the fraternity
for its donation.

“Following your instruc-
tions,” wrote the bishop, “!
have had the trophies melted
down, stamped into religious
medals and distributed to na-
tives in the hinterlands.”

Only then did the brothers
realize that they had been taken.
Such activities are firmly en-
trenched in American folklore.

They date back to the Harvard
Butter Rebellion of 1766, when
students complained, ‘Behold
our butter stinketh and we can
not eat thereof.”

The stimulating art of the
panty raid dates back to 1899,
when 400 pajama-clad Univer-
sity of Wisconsin males broke
into Ladies Hall and gayly
snitched some 200 unmention-
ables as coeds screamed in girl-
ish delight.

Rebelling against the let’s-
have-a-queen-for - everything -
under-the-sun craze, several
students nominated a nanny
goat for prom queen back in
the early 1940's.

Horrified campus politicians
claimed that the goat was not a
girl and, therefore, ineligible.
But the goat’s supporters pro-
duced a veterinarian to attest
to her femininity.

Finally, the goat was disquali-

fied on the grounds she had not
been a resident on the campus
the preceding year. Neverthe-
less, she still ran a strong third
in the voting.

Three profs at the Univer-
sity of Southern California
have gone on record as almost
unoonditionally condoning
pranks, providing they’re non-
destructive. They ere Dr.
Langdon E. Longstreth, psy-
chology professor; Dr. Thom-
as E. Lasswell, sociology pro-
fessor; and Dr. E. K. Nelson,
director of the Youth Studies
Center.

The comments to Karen Gus-
tafson, DAILY TROJAN feature
editor, included:

“It’s not harmful. I used to
engage in that sort of thing and
recovered.” And, “You've got
to get it out of your system
when you're young. Picture a
man of 40 in a panty raid.”
