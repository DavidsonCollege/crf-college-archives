Wildcats Win in Initial
Cage Game With Stars

Rusk, Playing New Position at
Forward, is High Point Man
for Team

The Davidson basketball aggregation
opened its 1930-1931 season a few days be-
fore college closed for Christmas holidays
by trouncing a team of Barium all-stars, 48
to 20. The clear superiority of the college
five was marked at all times, and the all-
stars, with two old Davidson men playing
the outstanding roles, never seriously threat-
ened.

The Davidson five jumped into the game
and wrested an overwhelming lead from the
all-stars. Such excellent guarding was
shown by the collegiates that they were
leading 21 points before their opponerits
were able to tally. At the half the score
stood 30 to 8 in favor of the Wildcats.

Dean Rusk, moved this year to forward
by Coach Younger, was high point man,
garnering 18 points. He was trailed by his
teammate, Martin, and Calhoun of the all-
stars, each with 12 points. The guarding
and floor play of Captain Goodson was par-
ticularly outstanding.

“
UNGER, ASST. FRESH COACH

COACH UNGER

“Doc” Unger, head coach of wrestling
at Davidson, comes here from the Uni-
versity of Indiana where he made an en-
viable record as a heavyweight in Big
Ten wrestling circles. He was'also a mem-
ber of the football team there. His work
as Freshman line coach this fall was full
justification of his addition to the coach-
ing staff, and he is an experienced wrest-
ling coach; he will have full charge of
the grapplers this winter.

A million dollar fund left as a foundation
for the education of females in or adjacent
to Philadelphia by Dr. William Curran, who
died 50 years ago, has been awarded to
Beaver College, at Jenkintown, near Phila-
delphia.

Most of what I learned at school is now
found to be inaccurate or wholly false.—

George Wins Decathlon
Trophy; Brannon Second

Track Star Scores 228 1-2 Points to
Win Annual All-Around
Championship

Graham George, versatile track star of the
Davidson track team, won the decathlon
race for 1930 by scoring 228 1-2 points and
winning five first places out of the ten that
he entered in. E. S. Brannon, another star
and letterman, finished second with 211 1-2
points. R. S. Hall came in third with 184 1-2
points to his credit. Frank Buckner was
fourth; B. Gwyn finished fifth; Tom Neal
placed sixth; Bill McGehee was the seventh
;man; Bob McCallie took eighth position;
Harold MeMillan and Gilmer were tied for

ninth place.

There were forty-five men entered in the
jdecathlon. This race extended over a good
jlength of time, starting about the first of

For winning this race, George will be
given a trophy on Athletic Night, which
will be held some time in the spring. This
trophy was awarded to Heath Whittle last
year,

The time in these events was very good
considering the bad weather at that time,
but no school record was broken. There
were twelve events and a man could choose
any ten that he wished to enter. The judges
set the qualifying time and distance and for
each fifth of a second cut off of the qualify-
ing time a point was given, and points were
also given for greater distances in the pole
vault, high jump, discus, and javelin.

The events and their winners are as fol-

lows:

Unger Disappointed
Over Mat Turnout

The to Coach “Doc” Unger's
plea for “more and bigger” wrestlers, which
he and Coach Tilson put before the student
body recently, has not received a very en-
thusiastic response, according to the wrest-
|ling coach’s statement. He stated that he
was rather disappointed in the turnout for
the varsity team, both by members of last
year’s squad whom he had counted on, and
also football linemen, who had been espe-
cially urged to come out by Coach Tilson.

“The men who are out and who are really
working hard are showing up well,” said
the mentor. “But all these men are light,
and a number of others who have the mak-
ings of good grapplers have been unusually
reticent in reporting, especially after Christ-

response

mas,”

Taylor, Tyack,,Vick, and Gorham are all
| showing up well in their weights. The com-
parative dearth of heavies is what is now
causing worry in shaping the team. None of
the men who worked in the higher weights
on last year’s teams have reported consist-

Back only a week from the Christmas |
holidays, and the Varsity meets what will)
perhaps be its hardest foe of the vear to- |
night on the Central High gymnasium |
floor at Charlotte. Then that is followed
by a game two nights later with the Car-
olina Tar Heels, always a fight. To say the
charges have bitten off a large hunk in
the way of basketball.

If there is a stronger team in the state

)than that which Doctor Ray Sermon has
| over at State this year, it is doubtful if it
|has been brought to light. They handed
| the powerful Villa Nova squad a decisive
licking in their pre-Christmas game, and

then the northerners went on to nose out
Duke and lick Wake Forest. It is gen-
erall conceded that State is apt to have an
edge over the Tar Heels.

All the teams in the state this year seem
to be made up largely of more or less
untried material, State has some veterans
in its lineup, but has been working in
sophomores all along. Duke has built its
team around Croson and Captain Rogers
and filling in with youngsters; and
Wake Forest and Carolina are far from
settled on their permanent set ups, Looks
like a great year for the youngsters, both

Davidson and all over the state.
Coach Younger has been working hard
with his squad and is shaping it into
form. In their game with the Barium
Spring All-Stars just before the holidays,
they won nicely and with very little real
exertion. But the competition is not near-
ly so strong as will be encountered this
week-end. The job of filling the shoes of
Pritchett and Johnston is proving a boon
to the barbers, in that it is causing Coach
Younger to have trouble with grey hair.

Wagner Drops Out
Due to Leg Injury

Jack Wagner, first string guard from last
year’s Freshman team, has been forced to
give up varsity basketball because of a bad
knee which has been giving him a great
deal of trouble. An operation will be neces-
sary to put the injured leg back in shape,
and this will keep Wagner out for the sea-
son.

On last year’s yearling quintet, Wagner
played a good game as standing guard, win
ning his numeral. He was expected to show
up nicely in his first year of varsity compe-
tition, and would probably have been used
as understudy to Jim Proctor, regular guard.

ently this winter, and therefore it is diffi-
cult to get a good line on them.

Turning to the Freshmen, Coach Unger
was much more optimistic. A large number
of men have reported for the team and sev-
eral of them have shown up nicely. It has
not been possible to get any definite line on
the prospects, but those who have shown up
well include Harrison, Hodges, Huie, Gra-
ham, Rhine, and Wilson.

This week's work will'do a lot to-
wards deciding things.

And while on the subject, the game
Wednesday night with the Erskine Se-
ceders should also prove a thriller. Last
year this squad was about the best in
South Carolina and journeyed to David-
son to hand the Wildcats a lacing. Anyone
that goes to the movies on that night,
figuring perhaps the game is a setup, is
apt to receive a shock. It will be well
worth watching. And it might be well to

| postpone cramming for those exams until

after nine o'clock, too.

The appeal of Coaches Tilson and Un-
ger for wrestlers should be given careful
attention. Coach Unger knows the wrest-
ling game from the mat up, and is also
an able teacher, The schedule this year,
both for varsity and freshman teams, is
unusually good. With a squad of twenty
men on each team, we believe that hé
could, put out a winning team,

The Davidsonian would like to see ar-
rangements made to bring the Duke game
to the campus. We realize that the facil-
ities here make such a procedure diffi-
cult, but it is not fair to the student body
to have all the big games in Charlotte,
where it is practically impossible for more
than half of the students to see them. The
poor seating facilities of the gymn and
the small attendance make it objection-
able to the visiting team, but if the game
could be brought here, we believe the
members of the student body would be
willing to pay a little to get the contest
on the home boards. What about it?

The greatest building program in the his-
tory of the Harvard University is being car-
ried out during 1930 and 1931. The new
buildings include freshman dormitories, units
of the new House Plan, laboratories of va-
rious kinds, field house, faculty club, dining
rooms, and a medical school dormitory, all
in the prevailing Georgian style of architec-
ture.

Petition Considered
By Sou. Conference

The petition of Davidson College for
membership in the Southern Conference was
referred to the Executive Committee of that
body at a meeting of conference officials
in Chapel Hill, December 11 and 12.

Davidson, along with four other colleges,
has asked for immediate entrance into the
conference, but action upon the application
has been, deferred by the committee until
a later date. After consideration by the Ex-
ecutive Committee it will probably be put
before the main body again, before a defi-
nite conclusion is reached. The conference
has another meeting in the spring, and it is
hoped that favorable action will be taken
at that time.
