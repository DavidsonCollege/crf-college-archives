Peace In Our Time?

This week's clash between the SLC and Random
House is just one more skirmish in a battle which has
been going on for three years. We feel that if SPE
wishes to maintain that they are just a group of
students who all happen to eat at Random House, they
should cooperate with the college and meet the
reauirem ents of the new leases.

As a selective fraternity, SPE is not entitled to a
house on Patterson Court. Therefore, there must be
more than a merely token distinction between SPE
and Random House. Up until now, SPE has been able
to remain selective and have a house on the court
without making the sacrifices or displaying the
cooperation which the other national fraternities have
shown.

The SLC is not being vindictive in our opinion, but is
simply carrying out the self-selection system which
was ordered by the Trustees in 1970.

Since it is not completely clear how much warning
Random House had in this matter. we feel that the
college should cooperate in every possible way to help
Random House find the necessary members. This is
particular. iue in light ot the fact that seit-selection
is now past and finding the needed students may be
extremely difficult.

This tricuun on Patterson Court has prevented it
from being as beneficial to the entire student body as
it might be. It is hoped that this will be the end of the
civil war on the court and that a spirit of cooperation
will prevail.

On Christian Commitment

We continue to tind it difticult to understand the
rauonale behind the policy of excluding non-
Christians trom gaining tenure at Davidson. The time
has come for a change.

It will destroy neither the community nor the
Christian nature of the college to have individuals of
different religious persuasions as tenured faculty
members. .

In fact. exposure to such divergent viewpoints. a:
with regard to anything else. can only give an in
dividual a better basis on which to make his own
decision on religious commitment And are we so
hypocritical to boast that we are an open community,
and yet practice discrimination among our own
ranks?

We therefore again urge the Trustees to reconsider
the college’s position. and to make it possible for

anyone, regardless of his religious beliefs, to gain
tenure.

Senatorial Stagnation

It might be a little too embarrassing — not to men-
tion exhausting — to go back into all that campaign
propoganda. all those promises by pruspeccive
senators, and pinpoint each of the specific instances
where assurances of ‘‘action ... motivation ... new life
in the Senate”’ just haven't heen realized

The most striking commentary on the inactivity of
the student Senate is the fact that complaints come
not from members of the general student body: they
seem not even to know that the Senate exists

The most disturbing proof is that conaemnation:
have to come from senators themselves; they're the
only ones who know what's happening with the:
Senate, and they seem to know that it doesn’t amount
to much. _

What first occurs is the question, ‘‘What’s the
Senate for, anyway?’ Presumably it has something
to do with representing the student body — which im-
plies being the focal point of student action.

Admittedly, at Davidson there may often be*a
marked lack of student action to focus. But the
Senate, by its very existence, asserts that it will
locate, stimulate, nurture any potential for activity
that can be identified

The initiative in reestablishing responsive, active
student government must therefore be taken by the
Senate. The first responsibility belongs to each in-
dividual senator.

Sterling Leaves College
Without Gold Wreaths

In the old days they gave
prizes to the victors, the most
courageous, to those who had
struggled and done well. You
could spend those rewards.
they were heavy golden in the
coin of the realm.

Davidson presently numbers
many such men among her
sons. There are many here with
us, but we shall soon lose one.

This week brings the an-
nouncement that Peter Sterling
will leave to direct education at
Colonial Williamsburg.

Peter was one of the first
people I saw at Davidson. In
those days. sans beard, with
clothes of more conservative
cut, he was an admissions of
ficer.

After one year’s duty there he
moved over to the student
Union building. His career
there has been one of frustrated

Progress.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Coming in as a junior partner,
he has consistantly tried to ‘en-
tertain educationally. to
schedule, plan, promote,
present only the best in events.
He has tried to spark interests
beyond the classroom. After
two years, some of his harc

work is paying off.

Peter was a Davidson
graduate — a poly-sci major —
Phi Beta Kappa.

He won a Woodrow Wilson
“ellowship to Georgetown
University where he received a
Master's Degree.

For eight years he was direc-
cor of studies at a school in New
England. In 1970 he did what he
had always hoped for—he came
back to Vavdison.

He was a soccer coach here.
He built his own home.

His wue alice is the first
grade teacher at the Children's

« Schoolhouse in Cornelius. This

group ‘has provided scholar-
ships for needy kids.

At the Symposium on Correc.
tions, Davidson was plunged in-
to the very heart of the correc-
tions situation. Peter had fired
up people with ideas.

» At the Medical Symposium,
three major speakers came.
Only one was given a gratuity.

We have had perhaps as
much programming at David-
son on as little money as
anywhere else in the country.
Much ot the credit goes to Peter
Sterling

Peter is current in education
His contribution has been to the
intellectual awareness at
Davidson.

we have no wreaths or
garlands or gold for you, Peter
Yet you deserve them. David-
son got much more than it paid
for. Ave atgue vole, with our ap-
preciation and gratitude

Student Blasts Art Department

To the Editor:

Having just returned from
my initial viewing of che so-
called student show in Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Hall I find it
difficult to reflect upon the
works’ there exhibited as one
should following a viewing of
any art exhibit

As I walked through the halls
and gallery of the building 1
grew practically ill as I reacted
more and more violently to
what I found there.

Not to be mistaken. I was not
reacting to specific works in
this manner. I was nauseated
by the handling and treatment
of the entire show.

My criticisms are many, but
there are a few specific items
that directlv offended me that I
would like to point out.

First, i was upset by the inex-

cusable lack of communication
on the opening date for the
show. The brochure put out by
the Art Department states that
the opening of the show was to
have been on Monday evening,
May 7. As you may recall the
opening was held on Sunday.
May 6.
_ I was personally offended by
this unexpecceu ana un-
derpublicized shift of dates as I
had people who were to come
from out of town to view the
show ning and who had
made advance plans to be here
on the 7th.

As it was they missed the
show and are quite upset. |
missed it myself as I was out of
town. having made my

earlier in congruence with the
May 7 date.

When I saw the show I was
again offended by the work that
was presented. My un-
derstanding of the purpose of
the show is that it is provided as
a forum for the presentation of
a representative cross-section
of What is happenine in the

studio arts here on the campus
As | viewea the show 1 telt

that it was a two-man show for

Messrs. Freed and Woodward

Indeed. they are artists and
deserve full credit as such

My regret. however. is that
they dominated the show with
such a profusion of works that
by sheer numbers they slighted
others who had a far fewer
number of works in the shou

To me ts does not serve tu
fulfill the purpose of the show. If
these artists or the professors
here desire to hold a one-man
show for either of these gen-
tlemen then have one! Do not
pervert an eclectic show for the
purposes of a few individuals’

Several other things nave
come to my attention as worthy
of criticism. I noticed that the
hanging was done with a staple-
gun. Several works were punc-
tured with the staples.

Such wanton disregard for ine
works depreciates the value of
the whole show. much less the
works that are so treated.

In conclusion, I must Say that
I am sorely disappointed in the
Art Department as a whole. and
those who handled the show in

Tothe Editor: .
In his cotumn ot April 27. Jo
Earle states “The cult) con

tinues New York raunchiness
You couldn't take them home to
Mama.”

It may come as a great sur-
prise to you Joe. but **Mama_’ is
still quite a few steps ahead ot
you when it comes to the topic ot
sex

What turns her off is the fact
that raunchiness doesn't make
good music, just as it doesn't
make good art or good drama

“Mama” tried to get this
point across to you which, «f
course, is why you'd pe em-
barrassed to take the Blue
Oysters home.

If you missed the message.
and if raunchiness turns you on.
you've got bigger problems to
solve then ‘‘who’s the top rock

To the Editor.

Action by a few students in
regard to the laundry linen ser-
vice has become somewhat
irresponsible. Recently one
student had his sheets ripped-
off when he put them down to
2at lunch.

Equally as contemptible have
been the methods used by some
students to get the most for
their laundry dollar — a few
have resorted to some deceitful
methods in order to gain an ex
tra sheet or pillow case.

Some students have kept the
linen that was provided for
prospective freshmen scholar-
ago.

I would like to encourage
these people to return this unen
to the laundry. Someone else is
responsible for these sheets and
has anticipated them being
returned.
