LETTERS 10 THE EDITOR

Nixon Critics Respond
To Operation Candor

(Ed. NOTE; The performance of Richard M. Nixon in fulfilling the duties of the office of the
Presidency and a DAVIDSONIAN editorial in the Nov. 30 issue have prompted much response
from our readers. We believe the following merit your attention.)

To the Editor:
Although I agree that im-
peachment _ procedures

should be initiated against
President Nixon, I think the
tone and style of your front
page editorial worked against
your goals.

Many journals and papers
have called for Mr. Nixon’s
impeachment or resignation
so your article is not a new
thought. The other editorials I
have seen were less strident,
more reasonable, and
probably more effective for
their comparative calmness.

many ways personified the ex-

To the Editor:

’ Davidson College has had a
long and honorable existence,
and, presumably this exem-
plary reputation will continue
through succeeding years.
However, having observed the
format of the November 30,
1973, edition of “THE DAVID-
SONIAN,” I am _ convinced
that some of the current
students need a candle to light
their way as they struggle to
become worthy alumni of that
great institution.

Since some of you approve
impeachment of the
President, we wonder on what
grounds you base your
opinions. Do you have some in-
side information that the rest
of us-the general public-is
ignorant of? We _ read
newspaper items which
distort the facts and are writ-
ten as though hearsay,
propaganda, and malicious
rumors were actual facts. We
listen to polls which are
calculated to present biased,
partisan opinions. We get TV
coverage which is verbalized
in a subjective manner--
reflecting the personal opinion
of the commentator-a far cry
from a genuine assessment of
the views of the public at
large.

Mr. Nixon has, of course, his
own particular problem of ex-
cesses. His press conferences,
his half explanations have tur-
ned him into an ironic
caricature of himself - a very
sad state for an American
public official. He has begun
to remind me of Monty Hall,
and I am wondering what's
left in the last surprise box on
stage.

According to Mr. Harris’
latest figures more and more

1. It lost its ‘‘coomph”’ in at-

tempting to draw some sort of
tenuous connection between

pointless revolution and disor-
der and the idle rhetoric
spouted by most of its ad-
vocates (exemplified by the
Jim Morrison quotation at the
beginning -and I do mean idle
rhetoric. What, indeed, did
Jim Morrison do that had any
positive, lasting effects on
American politics on gover-
nment - or anything else, for
that matter?) and bringing
about change in a lawful,
reasonable manner.

Inplicit in this approach is
what I discern to be a con-
descending attitude: ‘‘Well,
we know these turkeys won't
do anything dramatic, but
maybe we can make ‘em
strive a little.’’

To be one, few would be
willing to be ‘clubbed and
beaten’’ when there are other
courses of action open.

Well, Mr. Hoon, that is your

opinion.

2. It lacked specifics con-
cerning the rally itself, e.g.
who were the featured
speakers, where was the rally
to be held, and what exactly
was the purpose?

“‘Anti-Nixon rally” leaves
much to the imagination.

denounce the President
without going to Raleigh to do

conduct as I have described is
degrading to our democracy.
Need I mention, also, the in-
famy of playing one of the
President’s confidential tapes
at a party of inebriates? No,
you were not guilty of this
deplorable action, but you are
in agreement with those who
did. The bright side of this pic-
ture is the knowledge that
large segments of our society
are not in accord with these

anarchistic procedures.

Let us now examine the sub-
stantive worth of this man
whom you would destroy .

Before you were born.
Richard Nixon was serving his
country faithfully and well.
Elected to the House in 1946,
he was involved shortly
thereafter in an incident that
young people of today should
be cognizant of.

One of our former, revered
Presidents had an advisor in
whom he placed implicit trust.
This man sat at the ailing
President’s side and helped
dictate the terms of peace at
Yalta, terms which destroyed
the balance of power in
Europe, enabled Communistic
aggression to spread
wherever it would, and
created which our
nation is still trying to solve.

The President’s counselor
was eventually unmasked for
what he was, an arch-
Communist engaged in
espionage activities against
our country. The individual
who brought this criminal to
justice was none other than
Richard Nixon. (‘One Man
Alone: Richard Nixon,” by
Ralph De Toledano (1969) .)

You ‘are better acquainted
with the President’s more

recent activities: the historic
trip to Peking, and the events
of the night of October 25, 1973,
at which time, while you and I
slept comfortably in our beds,

from a possible future rain of

Watergate before the public
and keeping it there, that to
this day there has been no
celebration or public demon-
stration that would raise the
President in the public’s
esteem for having liberated
the prisoners, or of having en-
ded the war.

But if nobody else gives the
President credit for bringing
the pri home before
withdrawing the troops from
Vietnam, we can be sure the
prisoners themselves and
their families will be forever
grateful, not to mention the

material you present at the
very least.

To be “idealistic and com-
mitted’’ for no reason is ab-
surd - as is your reference to
the late Vietnam War
resistance movement. In case
you haven't noticed, that par-
ticular movement lost its im-
petus when the Vietnam War
(as far as we are concerned)
ceased to exist.

Further, the absence of this
air of condescension and
clarification of jumbled
opinion and fact will serve to
present your editorial opinions
(and the opinions of others) in
a better manner suited to
rational consideration.

speedily as possible from that
hideous war.

As for you young men of
today who are secure from
being drafted, are you not
grateful? Would you spurn the
hand that has protected you?
A very wise man once said,
“‘Ingratitude is the basest
sin.”’ Let us, therefore, give
credit where credit is due. If I
were in your place, I would
write the President a belated
letter of thanks. This is the
very least that you can do.

In conclusion, we expect
Watergate to have salutary
after-effects. Hereafter,
greater scrutiny will be made
of all political candidates,
their backgrounds, records,
and achievements, as well as
their to function
with honor and distinction in
the offices they seek.

No, we must not impeach
the President—a man who has
proved his worth many times
over. Instead, we should honor
him as a staunch patriot who
has labored zealously for
almost three decades for the
preservation of this country
and its people.
