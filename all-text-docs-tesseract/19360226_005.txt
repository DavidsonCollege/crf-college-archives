CENTER LEAVES

The top leaves of all tobacco plants tend to give
a definitely harsh, alkaline taste. The bottom
leaves tend to acidity in the smoke. It is only
the center leaves which approach in nature the
most palatable acid-alkaline balance. In LUCKY

STRIKE Cigarettes the center leaves are used.

LUCKIES ARE LESS ACID!

Recent chemical tests show” that other

popular brands have an excess of a¢id-
ity over Lucky Strike of from 53% to 100%.
