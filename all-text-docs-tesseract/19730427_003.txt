New Theatre Debuts
With Melodrama Play

A PREVIEW
By FRAZIER MARSH
Staff Writer

Amidst the concerts, parties,
and ballooning exhibitions this
weekend, there will also be a
play presented by the students
of the Drama Workshop.

The Drama Workshop in Cun-
ningham has been going
through some drastic changes
since this month began. Mike
Ramsey has turned the
workshop into the Showboat
Theatre for the presentation of
a melodrama, ‘‘Curse you, Jack
Dalton."

The show is being directed by
Jeanne Ann Williams.

When asked about the
Showboat Theatre, Williams
said, “‘The audience will be sit-
ting in layers from the floor to
the newly constructed balcony.
It makes a much more intimate
theatre, while trying to capture
the feeling of the old showboats
of years past.”

The distance between stage
and audience is only a few feet
wherever one sits. Everyone
will be able to see and par-
ticipate.

“The intimacy of the theatre
lends itself to audience par-
ticipation which is an in-
valuable part of the produc-
tion,"’ Williams added. ‘How
good a melodrama is depends
on the audience and how well
they respond to the play.”

Everything from the program
to the costuming will be totally

1890's. ‘‘The villian is so bad
and the hero is so good, as a
result, everyone will find it very

easy to identify with hero,’ she
explained.
“IT mean with lines like,

‘Many a heart that beats
beneath callico is more worthy
than that covered by silks and
satins,’ how could the audience
not help but cheer .*’

The characters in the play
may seem rather formal to the
audience, but this is to keep the
drama representative of the
nineteenth century.

Some of the acting may ap-
pear to be hamming, but that is
only another representative
feature of the old melodrama.

“The play will give the actor
a chance to ham to the best of
his ability. The play depends on
the audience and how well it
participates. The actors will be
better if the audience plays with
them,” Williams said.

There will be plenty of con-

cessions for all in the theatre.
With the purchase of the ticket
you will receive a bag of roasted
peanuts to eat or whatever.
There will be entertainment
between each act of the play.
“The entertainment will in-
clude comedians, prestadigi-
tators, and of course song and
dance routines,” she added.

“Though not as heavy as the
previous Davidson College per-
formances, the melodrama will
be an action packed hour of
fun,’’ Williams stated.

The production will last about
an hour. Performances will be
this afternoon at 2:15 and 3:45
p.m., tomorrow morning at
10:15 and 11:15 a.m., and at 2
p.m. tomorrow afternoon in the
Showboat Theatre of the Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Building.

Come to Cunningham and
laugh away an hour in the
Showboat Theatre. I guarantee
it will be an unforgettable ex-
perience.

Blue Oyster Cult: Raunch-Rock Leaders

By JOE EARLE
Associate Editor
ED. NOTE: Blue Oyster Cult
will be featured in Love
Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. on
Friday night.)

One of the great closet tra-
ditions of rock androll is the facet
of music dubbed raunch-rock.
Raunch-rock has beer around
a long time, dating back to

Elvis’ Pelvis, and probably
further, but it has been
generally maligned or at best
ignored. This was the type of
music that stirred parents up in
the fifties. It was preached
against in the churches, at-
tacked in the papers, and fought
in every teenage household in
the country. Raunch-rock was
the reason they wouldn't show
Elvis from the waist down on

FROLICS WEEKEND:

A Spring Spectacular

College Honors Lilly This Weekend
For Life-Long Student Dedication

By GRAY WILSON
Associate Editor

There is probably not a single student here who
knows Dr. Henry Lilly, but to much of the per-
manent structure at Davidson he is one of the
best things that ever happened to the school.

I knew of him only because he retired after 39
years as a Davidson English professor at a house
just down the street from where I live. About the
only time the neighborhood saw him was when
he went out in the evening to take his dog out for
a walk around the block.

This weekend, however, he will leave his home
‘in Boone, N.C. and come to Davidson
to receive an honorary degree at the spring con-
vocation.

‘I don’t deserve this honor,’ he pleaded over
the telephone, ‘‘I really don't. All I did was to try
to teach, and I enjoyed it. I'm one of those people
who simply loves teaching."

Lilly graduated from Davidson in 1918, but six
years later after fulfilling all the duties that
always plague someone the minute he leaves
college, he returned to teach English. He worked
- the regular basic courses, but soon was involved
with an honors program for an advanced fresh-
man group.

‘Then I was working with, say, the top 12 men
in freshman English. We conducted a survey
beginning with Sophocles, Plato, Virgil and con-
tinuing through the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance.

‘We studied Rabelais, Cervantes,
Shakespeare, Goethe and got all the way up to
the present day, which was Shaw.”

These freshman honors were modeled after a

program at Harvard and resemble the present
Humanities studies.

In addition, Lilly taught courses in Spenser,
Renaissance poetry and prose, 18th century
prose, Romantic poetry, and modern drama.

He also instructed a course entitled ‘‘History of
the English Language"’ which centered on his
life-long hobby, the study of words and their

origins

When he left Davidson a full professor in 1965,
not only the English Department but the entire
faculty was reluctant to let him go.

He was one of the few men who endeared him-
self to all his associates, and professors still
allude to him with nothing but respect and ad-
miration.

Appalachian State University was eager to
enlist the services of a veteran newly settled in
their midst, so they signed Lilly on in 1967 for four
more years instructing the choice courses in
Chaucer, Milton, and Spenser for upperclassmen
and graduate students.

Now at 76 he has returned for good, spending
most of his time wrapped up in word studies he
has been carrying on for years. Though he has
compiled a great deal of information, he has no
plans to have anything published, simply
because he thinks “‘It's just not that good."’

So once again Dr. Lilly, along with his wife
Grace, will visit a schoo! which has not forgotten
‘his many capable years of service.

Whatever criticisms might be levelled against
the cost and carnage of convocations, and
whatever real losers might have been crowned in
past years, no degree candidate deserves the
honor more than a man who has devoted his life
to Davidson College.

It was the reason you,
couldn't play rock and roll in
high schools. It was basic sex,
and back in the good ole days it
was dirty.

But the sixties changed all
that. Rock was cleaned up. I
mean, who wouldn't have taken
the Beatles home to Mama back
in 64? They were clean. And
nice. And especially cute.

Raunch-rock turned into
teeny-rock, with magazines and
Lloyd Thaxton. It wasn't dirty
anymore. And, dammit, it
wasn’t near as much fun.

But the evils of raunch-rock
held on. Jim Morrison did his
best to keep it alive (and you
saw where it got him). Still, he
was ok, because he was
metaphysical and all. Talked a
lot about snakes.

It took the decadent seventies
to bring raunch-rock back.
Along with all the other nifty
things from the fifties (cars,
clothes, a President), we now
have a resurgence of good nasty
rock and roll.

In the forefront of this new
spirit is Blue Oyster Cult. The
Blue Oysters are from New
York, a town that helped
preserve one of the all-time
great raunchy bands, the Velvet
Underground.

The Cult continues New York
raunchiness. You couldn't take
them home to Mama.

The band's instrumentation is
done in the classic rock vein:
two guitars, drums, bass,
singer, keyboards, with a bit of
synthesizer thrown in, None of
the members is particularly
outstanding on his instrument
but they are all good, and they
work together.

The problem with it is that the
boys take themselves too
seriously. Take ‘‘Tyranny and
Mutation", their new album.
They don't seem content to be
just sexy, they've gotta be
metaphysically evil, too.

The album's other great
drawback is the band's efforts
to get ‘‘heavy"’ with the produc-
tion. They incorporate a lot of
little side effcts like feedback
intros and metallic fadeouts
that simply get obnoxious after
a couple of quick listenings.

Despite their drawbacks,
Blue Oyster Cult does what they
do well. The have a very com-

-patible set of musicians who
work the most out of the old
high energy music, and a good
lead singer. There is a lot of
metal and flash, but everything
is geared toward the basic ex-
citement of the music.
