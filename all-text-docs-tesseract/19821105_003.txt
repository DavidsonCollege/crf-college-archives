ROTC Collects
Blood

To the Editor:

On November 3, 1982, the 42nd
Blood Drive took place under the direc-
tion of Brad McCall. Planning began six
weeks previously for this semi-annual
event, sponsored by the Scabbard and
Blade Society of ROTC and the North
Carolina Chapter of the American Red
Cross. The drive was staffed by Red
Cross personnel, Emergency Medital
Technicians, women from the commu-
nity, and ROTC cadets.

The processing table opened at
10:00 a.m. in the Union and one hour
later eighty persons were on their way to
donating a pint of blood. By the end of
the day, 350 persons had been in-pro-
cessed and 294 pints had been collected.
Thirty-nine persons were not able to do-
nate because of medical reasons such as
low iron concentration. Seventeen per-
sons decided not to give after signing in.
Many who donated blood were typed
for pheresis donations.

A pizza dinner was offered for the
greatest participation by a hall, eating
house, or fraternity. Second West Belk
claimed this prize, having 58 percent of
their group donate.

The

PUG:
Ready to Use

Greetings to the students and faculty of
Davidson College,

The PRIME Users Group is an in-
formal organization of computer users
which offers many valuable programs
and files. PUG is easy to access and use.
After logging into your UFD, enter the
Primos command “MENU.” To find out
what programs are available and how to
use them, ask to see the “Directory.”
The Directory will also tell you when it
is all right to copy a program into your
UFD. (If you don’t have a UFD, ask for
one at the Computer Services Center.)

The programs and files fall into
three categories: instructional, useful,
and fun. Instsruction files range from
“GRAPHICS .INSTR’ which tells about
the new Graphics system, to
‘CPL.INSTR’, which will hav have you
writing CPL’s in no time! Useful pro-
grams include ‘B.PROOF’, which
checks spelling against a list of correctly
spelled words, ‘B.INDENT’ which
makes those Basic programs pretty, a
number of helpful PL1 routines, and a
host of time-saving CPL’s that do ever-
ything from creating personal abbrvia-
tions (CREATE.CPL), to getting you to
class on time (ALARM.CPL). And
when you’re ready for a study break,
play one of PUG’s wide selection of
games. ‘B.TREK2’ goes where no man
has ever gone before, ‘B.RUNNER’
takes you on a journey as bizarre as
Drop-Add, while ‘B.BJ’ and
‘B.ROULT? let you try your luck in Las
Vegas. ‘B.RACE1’, ‘S.ZOK’ and

_ ‘§.ZOK’ and ‘S.HANGMAN’ are also

Project Advisor Boe Young called |

the Blood Drive “an unqualified suc-
cess.”

The ROTC Department extends its
gratitude to the following merchants for
their support: Anheuser-Busch; David-
son Dry Goods; The Flower Cart; John
Mac & Son; King of Pizza; M & M Soda
Shop; The Peregrine House; and The
Village Store.

popular. Run ‘B.STORY’ to add to the
end of an on-going comedy, or
“‘B.DARWIN’ to experience the wond-
ers of evolution. Watch for ‘B.VID-
BAL’ -video pinball- coming soon!

Most importantly, The PRIME Us-
ers Group needs input from everyone so
that PUG can continue to facilitate con-
structive and enjoyable use of David-
son’s Computer. If you would like to be-
come a member of PUG, or if you have
suggestions, ideas, programs, or com-
plaints, please contact Bill Appleton
(SOWCA) or Hunter Monroe
(SOHKM) in person or through Pug-
messages.

Happy Hacking!

Co-Directors of PUG

Cross-Country
Corrected

To the Editor:

I wish to clarify some inaccuracies
that appeared in Gary Sullivan’s article
on the Cross-country meet at Georgia
State. First, the order of finishers he list-
ed was incorrect for both teams. Frank
Hague, a sensational freshman, was the
fifth place finisher on the men’s team. I
was sixth. Also along these lines, the
bee sting I suffered a few weeks ago no
longer affects my running. The fourth
and fifth place finishers for the women
were Kerris Herrnstein, who ran the
race of her young career, and Chris Seel
respectively. Second, Frank Ivey also is
planning to make the trip to Wisconsin.
He qualified as well as the women’s
team. His name was left off. Third, the

~.,hospital grounds we raced on belong to

a mental hospital. I doubt very seriously
that the race was run there for “precau-
tionary measures.”

Hey Stewart,

I think the calendar is hysterical. |
always read it first now, like the comics

in The Observer.

Yours amusedly,

To the Editor:

‘The article in a recent ‘sonian, “Na-
tional PIRGs Face Conservatives,” ac-
curately reported the national scene but
failed to mention a most relevent fact:
funds to the Davidson-PIRG are given
on a completely voluntary basis NOT by
the automatic checkoff system de-
scribed in the article.
