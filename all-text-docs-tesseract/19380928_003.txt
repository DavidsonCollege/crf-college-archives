THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question
of the

Week

Since Davidson turns out with al-
most a hundred percent attendance
at her football games, the question
this week concerns everyone. Are
the ‘games which are held in Char-
lotte “worth the extra cost? Would
you rather that they were held here
at Davidson, or is there some other
place that would suit us all better?
Here is the question as it
given to a tew of the students:

“What do you think of Davidson
hotding her football games in Char-
latte?”

was:

Julian Squires—Senior:

“There are, several reasons whyt
1 would Hike to have more of our,
games played on the caimpus. There
is first of

all that-extra gate tee,
and alsa the extra expense of
transportauon, Then, too, the,

spirit is much better on our home
grounds than clsewhere. 1 think
that the spirit means a lot ta the
team and to the school as a whole.”

Louis Hipp—Senior:

“L think that it is good to have |
at least one game a season held in|
Charlotte. It gives us a chancet
to have the trimmings which” go]
along with the games. such as
parades and large crowds. It’ also
advertises Davadson to the people
of Charlotte and surrounding towns
which fact was shown by the ad-
ded interest of the newspapers.

Jack Abernathy, Junior:

“I would many times rather have
the games heid here than in Char-
lotte. There is more. football!
spirit manifested here than off the
campus. Next to Davidson | dike‘
those games held in Greensboro |
hest. Hf the games are to be heid:
in Charlotte. L hope that they will |
he played in the afsernoon rather |
than at night as was done ths
past week.”

Jim Armstrong—Senior: ;

“L can't see the percentage in!
having a stadiue bere at Davidson. |
especially as pood a one as we have,
and not using ut. The students |
have already paid their athletic fee
which gives them admittance to all
games, and 2 don't. think that it “is”

fair to make them pay an extra fee 7

to, see one ‘of the home games
that they have already paid for”,
| believe, also, that the team can
play a better game here than any
other place.” ‘e

Rufus Allison—Junior:

“I would hke to see Charlotte
made into. a big football center;
but at the present 1 thiak shot

most of the football games shontd |
be held on the campus. 1 believe
tha everybody as a whole would
rather have them here beeause of
the extra entrance fee. There is.
one thing to say in favor of it
though; those boys who would like
to take girls who live in Charlotte
don't Nive to worry about getting
them to the game and home again
after: it ‘is over. I, feel, though,
that all that can be said for hav-
ing them away from here is over-
shadowed by that said against it!
The games held tere seem to be
bigger affairs ‘and | look forward
to more of them.”

Sherrard Rice—Senior:

Inv opposed to holding what!
should be Davidson's home games
in Charlotte. Several thousands of ,
dollars have just recently been
spent to enlarge the stadium here.
The students pay an athletic fee at
the beginning of school which is
supposed to eover all home games,
