Administration cites
liability issues, national
trends for no-keg policy

In the early 1990s, kegs were a popular ad-
dition tocampus parties. Not only were the kegs
allowed, but they were not restricted to con-
cealment in the basement. They were permit-
ted upstairs and even on the porches of
Patterson Court houses during parties.

In 1992, the administration changed the col-
lege policy by requiring kegs to be kept in the
basement of houses to prevent underage drink-
ing.

The next year a new policy prohibited stu-
dents from carrying up more than two cups at
one time. :

Finally, in 1996, the college adopted a no-
keg policy, completely eliminating the over-
sized beer barrels from the Davidson social
scene.

At the time, the change was not a matter of
great controversy.

“We were given a real awareness of the li-
ability factors related to kegs, and it didn’t
disturb the party scene on the court,” said David
Wick ’97, Kappa Sigma president and mem-
ber of the Patterson Court Council during the
policy implementation. “The college admin-
istration educated students about the liability
and safety factors related to kegs and worked
with us to ensure a smooth transition. It really
didn’t disturb the party scene on the court.”

“These organizations have chosen to do this
because of the large number of alcohol-related
injuries and deaths that were resulting from
over-consumption when party guests were
served from kegs or other bulk-quantity, com-
mon-source containers,” said Patterson Court
Adviser Joy Hamm. .

Hamm stressed that kegs increase liabilit
risks.

“Kegs place a tremendous amount of liabil-
ity on the individual organization. Serving from
a keg can be more difficult for organizations to
manage, and in some cases can lead to heavier
alcohol consumption,” Hamm said.

Addressing the liability issue, former PCC
President Greg Stewart ’05 said, “Atregistered
parties, we fill up a 12 oz. cup with beer from
a can. How is filling that same 12 oz. cup up
with beer from a keg any different? While the
school has argued that people can’t count drinks

What does PROSPERITY mean...

Long a non-issue, some
now long for kegs on Court

when it is coming from a keg, when it comes
to aregistered party you would receive beer in
the same way.”

Stewart also noted that purchasing the same
amount of beer through kegs would be cheaper
for Patterson Court houses than buying cases
of cans.

While administrators claim kegs lead to
dangerous levels of drinking, there is concern
that it has only pushed alcohol consumption
off-campus and out of sight.

Several students contacted by the
Davidsonian declined to comment on the
record, but admitted to attending off-campus
parties and, in some cases, on-campus dorm
room parties where kegs were present.

One student who would go on record, Sean
Wentworth ’05, said he, too, had attended off-
campus parties where kegs had been present
on several occasions.

“Some of these places were beyond what
some people were willing to walk to,” imply-
ing students might drive to and from these
parties. Wentworth said he did not know of any
drunk driving that occurred, but he added, “‘it’s
not a stretch to imagine,” Wentworth said.

Yet the no-kegs policy is hardly a restriction
unique to Davidson. Both Dean of Students
Tom Shandley and Director of Residence Life
Leslie Marsicano emphasized that most col-
leges and universities do not allow kegs for the
same reasons.

“Kegs were prohibited eight years ago as a
result of the institutional self-study of all as-
pects of student life,” said Shandley. “Not only
are they banned by national fraternities, but the
reason that common containers are prohibited
is because there is substantial evidence that it
increases dangerous drinking.”

Despite these assurances and the smooth
transition at the time, not all Davidson students
are convinced of this wisdom. Some students
speculated that image, as much as legal liabil-
ity, influenced the college’s decision.

“Davidson does not want to permit kegs
because of the stigma that accompanies the
‘college keg’ party. I fail to see the difference
between six cases of beer and one keg, with the
exception of less aluminum waste and an easier
clean up for all involved,” said Catie Williams
04.

Other students are more radical, claiming the
liability issue is just a cover for a larger anti-
alcohol campaign at Davidson.

“I am always skeptical when an individual
or institution outlaws an item or activity be-
cause of ‘liability,” said Roland Foss ’05, an
independent. “You have to wonder if Davidson
has another motive here.

“‘We’ ve got the ban on kegs and open con-
tainers, and the relegation of liquor to the base-
ment. Now we’ ve got the smoking ban and the
17% campaign. What is the college trying to
do here?”

While such claims are only opinion, but-
tressed with circumstantial evidence, itis a view
shared by many a reveler on and off the Court.

Concern about the no-kegs policy has also
come from an unlikely source — the Environ-
mental Action Coalition (EAC).

“A typical party produces about 60 to 70
gallons of aluminum waste, plus the cardboard
used in the case boxes. Multiply that by the
number of parties each week on the court, and
you get an unnecessary amount of waste and
work. One keg is the equivalent of 70 cans of
beer. A reusable keg would eliminate a very
large percentage of court-generated waste,”
said Carlson.

On the green issue, President Vagt said, “It’s
one thing to say we need to recycle...but I am
reluctant to say that the reason we should al-
low kegs is to improve recycling. There has
got to be a better way to solve the problem.”

Waste generated by cans is an issue already

* being addressed by the administration. Re-

cently, PCC has worked with the-EAC to add
a recycling component to the set of Standards
that all Patterson Court houses must meet.
