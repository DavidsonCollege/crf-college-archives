Practice Zen For Your Tests

INDIANA, Pa. (CPS)-Re-
peat this phrase several times:
“Grades do not matter,” reports
J.J. Gibbs, a professor of crimi-
nology at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania.

Gibbs, author of “Dancing
with Your Books: The Zen Way
of Studying,” suggests that stu-
dents practice Zen and find "the
zqne" to learn how to score high
grades.

Zen emphasizes the task at
hand, Gibbs writes, and is cen-
tered in the present moment. Us-
ing this tool can remove “impedi-
ments” to study, and when stu-
dents fully concentrate on their
work, they will discover satisfac-
tion with study.

He offers these tips to get in
the Zen mode:

-Clear your mind through
meditation and deep breathing. .

-Let go of other tasks and
make acommitmenttostudy fora
set amount of time.

-Settle into studying and ab-
sorb the material.

-Dismiss thoughts that are
straying from the task.

-Study as if it’s the only rea-
son you were put on this earth.

“To live fully you have to
pay full attention to what you’re
doing,” he said.

Jesse Jackson Talks to Youth
INDIANA, Pa. (CPS)-

“Young America, you have the |

capacity, you have the will. Don’t
let this moment pass. Keep this

moment alive,” said the Rev. Jesse |

Jackson, telling the youth of
America that they have to “move
forward to hope, not backward by
fear.”

The nationally known orator
and civil rights activist was speak-
ing at Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania, addressing issues of con-
cern for today’s youth.

Students, Jackson said, are
the source of change in America,
so much more so than the courts,
the president, and other elected
officials. There is much that the
twentysomething generation has
to accomplish, Jackson said, but
they must overcome obstacles first
in order to fight for change. If the
youth are scared of guns and mur-
der, they don’t have the energy to
fight for! health care, Jackson said.

The young of this country
have two sets of problems facing
them, said Jackson.

The first quagmire is the ero-
sion of the tax base and the loss of
jobs. The second problem involves
the “moral degeneracy” that youth
have come to live with.

What can we do now?

The youth must take the fore-
front. When the youthof America
find the impetus and courage to
change, the rest of the world fol-
low, said Jackson.

Community Day goes Into the Streets

‘By Mary Clare Jalonick

As Davidson students ven-
tured downtown last Friday after-
noon with their parents, they were
met with a Halloween parade of
several hundred of the town’s chil-
dren. In coordination for the first
time ever with Davidson’s Reach
Out program, Davidson Parks and
Recreation sponsored the event.
The carnival was also a part of
Reach Out’s “Into the Streets”
week. Friday was “Community
Day.”

For the carnival the children
dressed up in their Halloween cos-
tumes and passed by the doors of
several of the town’s shops. There,
local merchants gave them candy
and wished them a happy Hallow-
een.

Carol Reid, of Allen Mort-
gage, enjoyed the event. “This isa
lot of fun. It’s just another ex-
ample of the college holding the
town together.”

From the stores, the children
ventured on to the field where
Davidson students manned differ-

ent activity booths. The booths in-
cluded cookie decorating, ring toss,
fortune telling, and hot apple ci-
der.

The students seemed to feel
that the carnival was for a good
cause. “This is a good opportunity
for Davidson students to integrate
with the community. Hopefully this
will help to make us more unified,”

said Frances Bailey, a sophomore
who was working at the event.

The townspeople were enjoy-
ing themselves also. Some people
even journeyed a little to be there.
Julie Parton, a mother from
Huntersville, comes up every year
for the carnival. “This is wonder-
ful for the little kids. They have
done an excellent job.”

Parents came from across the
country for the annual parents'
weekend. The weekend has beena
tradition at Davidson College for
approximately twenty-five years.
Originally, around 850 parents
were expected to attend. This esti-
mation was surpassed with about a
total of 1,000 parents, the largest

number of ‘parents ever to attend
the weekend.

Events for parents and their
students began Friday and contin-
ued until Sunday afternoon.

Many of the activities for Fri-
day had an academic focus. Par-
ents, were invited to visit classes
with their son or daughter. They
were also able to meet with mem-

the weekend

bers of the faculty during the day.
Sports events as well as the pro-
duction of Equus were some avail-
able options for entertainment.
One of the most popular events
of the weekend was the open house
at the Visual Arts Center on Satur-
day afternoon. Parents were able
to see the new building and heard

events continued on Saturday.

Sunday was the close of the
weekend. Worship services were
available for those who were inter-
ested. Equus was performed one
final time forthose who did not get ~
achance to see it during the rest of
the weekend. A soccer game was
held at Richardson Field.

Alltogether parents' weekend
was successful. Parents were able
to get a true sense of Davidson
while spending time with their sons
and daughters.

Dean Terry said parents' week-
end “enables parents to visit their
sons and daughters and gain a new
appreciation for Davidson.”

Rosenbach speaks on strife in Bulgaria

By Jay Jennings
Most people do not think of
going to Bulgaria on their summer
vacation, but at least one, Eric

_ Rosenbach, did last summer. He

got a grant from the Dean Rusk
Program to study how the eco-
nomic and political reforms were
progressing since their conception
in 1989. Eric spoke about his stud-
ies on behalf of the Dean Rusk
program on Thursday.

After spending the spring se-
mester in Spain and travelling in
Western Europe for one month,
Eric arrived in Bulgaria. Once he
stepped off the train, he saw a
beleaguered country.

He witnessed a protest on his
first day against the political situa-
tion. Hunger strikes and tent cities
are common place in Bulgaria,
because of the unstable situation.

Although the Communists
have lost some power since 1990,
they still are very much involved

in the society. The legacy of the
Bulgarian dictators is still great,
according to Rosenbach, |

The economy of Bulgaria has
some instances of capitalism, butit
has not helped the slow economy
improve to great extent. Eric dealt
with the black market wherever he
went. This is probably the closest
thing to capitalism that there is in
Bulgaria.

Eric saw the environmental
problems that have not been dealt
with in the Valley of the Roses.
There are nuclear and chemical
waste dumps that are literally kill-

ing the environment, but the gov-
ernment does not have the capital
to correct the problem. |.

The government could cor-
rectsome ofits problems, but with-
out the capital to do it, the country
will remain in its place as one of
the poorest countries of Europe.

The political and economic
situation of the country did not
hinder Eric from having a great
time there. He was able to travel
around for relatively little money,
because of the economic situation.
So he has many stories to tell about
the people he met in Bulgaria.
