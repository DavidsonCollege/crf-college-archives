Nickel and dime worth some change

Huntersville entrepreneur invents new billiards board game for Christmas

By Apam HICKEY
Staff Writer

Coins, not billiards, are whata
Huntersville loan officer-turned-
entrepreneur is banking on to make
his unique Version of portable pool
a sure shot this gift-giving season.

Played by ricocheting brass
coins into slots on a 12” x 14”
miniature pool table, Nickel &
Dime Pool has received positive
print from such magazines as Bil-
liards Digest, Pool and Billiard
Magazine, and Toy Business, in
addition to being named a 1995
Toy of the Year Finalist by Family
Fun magazine.

All this has happened before
the toy has even been officially
presented to the market, an event
reserved for February’s Interna-

tional Toy Fair in New York.

A. Cone, inventor of Nickel &
Dime Pool and founder and presi-
dent of Puffin Corporation, the
company which makes the game,
worked in a brokerage firm and a
bank before he realized that in-
venting was what he really wanted
to do.

“You don’t have to pick your
vocation for the next 60 years when
you’re 19 years old,” he said.

He used to leave his job at
First Union National Bank at 5
p.m., not to think of his work until
the next day. Not so anymore. —

“Tt’s my life,” he says of his
fledgling corporation, whichis giv-
ing the big birds at Parker Broth-
ers, Pressman, and other such toy
mega-giants a run for their money
in toy competitions.

No stranger to invention,
Cone’s first foray into the game
market came in 1983 when he in-
troduced Play It Smart, a trivia
game, to the market.

“I was intrigued by Trivial
Pursuit,” he said, but after a while
he found its trivia to be “useless
garbage.

Determined to “educate the
world” on “life-changing facts,”
the 28-year-old MBA from Chapel
Hill spent almost three years writ-
ing the questions for the game.

When it was launched itearned
a host of awards, among them #1
Game of the Year 1994 from Fun
and Games Magazine, and Top
Ten Game from the Chicago Tri-
bune.

“I thought I’d have another
Trivial Pursuit ... I didn’t.”

Sales of the game were mod-
est, drawing a consistent but mea-
ger salary for him and his wife,
Suzanne, who both run the com-
pany out of their home.

So Cone began work on what
was to become Nickel & Dime
Pool.

Eleven years in the making, a
working prototype was completed
in 1994, and in February of this
year the game hit the market, sell-
ing primarily through the National
Luggage Dealer’s Association,
which links such chains as Char-
lotte-based Sharon Luggage and
Gifts with similar stores across the
nation.

Still a small company, Puffin
Corporation has yet to become a
household name.

In an effort to build a strong

reputation in the game market, the
Cones devote as much of their per-

sonal attention to the business as °

possible.

Each board is inspected be-
fore it is shipped, and to each cus-
tomer who buys directly from the
company a thank-you note is
mailed.

Cone, whose favorite board
game growing up was Monopoly,
is excited about the game’s suc-
cess and is already planning varia-
tions: on the Nickel and Dime
theme.

Mary Skipper, who manages
Davidson’s The Village Store gift
shop, reports a positive customer
response to both games. ‘““We’ve
sold tons of [Play It Smart],” she
said, and as for Nickel and Dime
Pool, “It sells very well.” _

Cleanliness is next to ... your wallet!
Disgruntled students charged in inconsistent RLO apartment inspections

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

Dirty common areas cost se-
niors cleaning time and in one case
$40 after RLO sent the Building
Staff to the Martin Court Apart-
ments for their annual fall clean-
up inspections.

Flyers were sent to apartment
residents two days before inspec-
tions which were conducted right
before Thanksgiving Break. The

flyers detailed the areas which
should be cleaned.

In addition to unvacuumed
carpets and unswept floors, seniors
were told that dirty showers, mir-
rors, sinks and countertops would
be*reasons for failure. Students
were also expected to remove trash
and upholstered furniture from the
porches. Only common areas were
subject to inspection. :

Residence Life hoped that
advanced notice and specific guide-
lines about the inspections would
prevent seniors from failing the
inspection. Still, seven apartments
out of eighty needed a second in-
spection and one even required a
third visit from Building Services,
which cost them a $40 fine.

The Housing Operations Co-
ordinator of Residence Life,
Debbie Young, felt that the inspec-
tions represented a “good system.”
Residence Life organized the in-
spections while Building Services
employees examined the apart-
ments for cleanliness.

Young states they had “good
cooperation from the students” and
that the advance notice helped stu-
dents prepare for the examinations.

Yet some seniors weren’t as

positive about RLO’s inspection.

efforts.

One Martin Court resident
complained about possible incon-
sistencies in the inspection proce-
dures. Though his apartment was
cited for a.dirty oven, stove and
shower, the Building Services in-
spector didn’t require a subsequent
inspection. According to another
resident, her apartment needed
another inspection for only a dirty
shower.

A dirty sink was ‘ite only’con-
dition, according to apartment
members, that cost them $40 after
a second inspection.

Residence Life employees feel
that the inspections are necessary
because Martin Court Apartments

are occupied in the summer months
too, and some people move in only
acouple of days after seniors leave.

Young wants students to do
everything they can “‘to expediate
housekeeping” because Building
Services doesn’t have time
to”sandblast” apartments due to
the short turnaround of occupants.

Other dorms on campus are
used in the summer, but Young
explains that Building Services are
continually inspecting and clean-

ie Jnmagmmon areas ip.the dorms. .....
till, some students question

whether or not the apartment in-
spections are too premature and
maybe even too particular. Bill
Gullan states, “I understand why
they want to conduct the inspec-
tions but it seems like an inspec-
tion this early in the year might be
a little excessive.”

Young felt that the timing of
the inspections was convenient for
students who would “probably.
wanttoclean their apartments any-
way” before the holiday.

Futhermore, she feels that
Davidson’s inspections are more
lenient than other school’s state-
wide, and that because RLO has
organized the inspections for 5
years, the inspection forms have
increasingly become more “user-
friendly.”

Residence Life plans to ini-
tiate another Martin Court inspec-
tion this spring.
