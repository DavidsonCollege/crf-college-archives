at North Carolina State College Friday and
Saturday, May 2nd and 3rd. Carolina won
the meet with a score of 107% points, State
came next, having won 57% points, while
Wake Forest and Trinity brought up the rear
with 14% and 9% points respectively.

Carolina won seven first places, State six,

Gracey was the chief scorer for the Wild-
cat aggregation, winning 9 of their 2134

Laird Relieved by Boushe in Third
Inning Which is Distastrous
Frame—Spikes is Trinity’s
Star Batter

An avalanche of hits coming at times when
they were most needed, gave the Trinity
Methodists a 12 to 4 victory over the Da-
vidson tossers in Gastonia last Saturday aft-
ernoon. Laird, pitching the first three in-
nings for the Wildcats, was accorded miser-

By Wildcats Give Trinity Gastonia Game

Vance led the team in batting, each with four
hits. Boushee was right behind them with a
double and a triple to his account. Moore,
R., was the big hitter for the South Carolina
boys. Hannah pitched good ball except for
the fatal 6th and 13th innings.

The P. C. team led with the score at 4-1
until the sixth, when Hannah showed signs
of weakening. The bases were full with no
out when he hit Kimbrough and. walked
Boushee and Simpson. They all three came
in on Covington’s sacrifice hit and Vance’s

Washington and Lee

The Wildcat cinder men closed their in-
vasion of the Old Dominion with their most
disastrous defeat of the season when they
met the stellar Washington and Lee aggre-
gation at Lexington on Monday, April 28th.
The final tally gave the Generals the big end
of a 104-22 score. fi

Howard, an entree for the United States
Olympic team for 1924, starred for the home
team and easily featured the mect. He
captured first place in both the 880 and the
mile, and apparently could have taken the
two-mile with ease, when he came in only a
second behind his running mate,

e

For the first time, Gracey, the Wildcat
track star, failed to take a first place. How-
ever, he covered himself with glory when he
|hurled the javelin 160 feet 3 inches, smash-
ing the college record by almost a foot; he
also accounted for 9 of the Wildcats’ meagre
total of points.

McConnell and Captain Streibich copped
second honors in the mile and pole vault re-
| spectively. Other Red and Black men plac-
|ing were Anderson, Williford and Koenig.
| In the last event of the day, Red Anderson,
; the Wildcat dark horse, sprained his ankle
; when he heaved the javelin 155 feet for a
| good third place.

| CHAMPION WIELDERS OF
WILLOW BEING DECIDED

The class baseball schedule has been
jcut down to an elimination series of
|three games this year. This is due to
the fact that the varsity field can only
be used this week, and the freshmen field

is not suitable for games at the present
time], Work is to be started Monday
| planting grass on the regular field and it
| is for this reason that no games are to be
| played after this week.
Managers were elected by the different
| classes last week and the following men
; were selected: G, M. Hodgin, Senior;
| Ed. Morrison, Junior; N. E. Sappenfield,
; Sophomore; and J. C. Bernhardt, Fresh-
man,

A schedule has been worked out, by
the managers and eligibility rules made.
The schedule worked out was for the
Freshman-Sophomore game to be play-
;ed, Monday, the Junior-Senior * game

work, This makes the third straight year

Not all of the past should be forgotten,
though. Particularly, one event of the past
week, when Harry Price kept the state
single’s championship for Davidson. Harry
played stellar ball at Greensboro, for when
his opponent had already copped two sets, he
came back and took the next three. Good

Davidson has copped the singles champion-
ship.

And Staley and Price didn’t miss much
bringing the doubles championship back to
the Hill, either, for they stayed in there until
the semi-finals. Good work all the way
‘round.

Gracey loses his shoe in the state meet in
high hurdles, and still gets third place. Some
folks argue that if he had lost both of tgem
he would have come in first. We argue,
though, that if he hadn't lost his one shoe
there would have been a different tale.

Red Laird certainly stuck in there and
fought them this past season. He pitched
some great battles.

By the way, how does this sound:

Davidson 5, Oak Ridge 5 (10 innings).

Davidson 1, State 2 (12 innings).

Davidson, 5, Furman 8 (12 innings).

Davidson 7, P. C. 4 (13 innings).

That doesn’t sound so bad after all, does
it? Indicates some good games were played.

Twenty-five innings in two days would
sound like three games, almost, but it only
meant an extension for a few innings of the
two games listed above.

The Freshmen seém to stand in a good way
toward the interclass baseball championship.

They are using their regular team, and they
know how to work together. The Sophs re-
ceived their defeat Monday, 5-2, and the
Yearlings are meeting the winner of the
Junior-Senior fracas today, That was a good
game Monday, parenthetically speaking.
—— vy)

When one sees Sapp handle that ball out
on short he can’t help but believe that Sapp/
has the idea that he’s still behind the bat.

The grapplers are going to have a big trip

able outfield support, resulting in nine runs
for the Trinity batsmen.

Boushece went to the mound near the end
of the third inning, and Laird was shifted to

single. A base on balls and three hits, two
of them for three bases, brought in three
more in the 13th, The box score follows:

Trinity’s six runs in the third frame were
made when Turner and Spikes singled past

Johnson and Chappen singled.

Davidson's first two runs were scored in
the initial inning of the game. Sion Alford
was hit by a pitched ball, Marrow scratched
an infield hit, sending Alford to second, both
runners were advanced on. Smith's sacrifice.
Wher Vance singled, both runners crossed
the home plate. Again, in the seventh, Da-

the Trinity hurler, went up in the air, walk-
ing four mén. He was replaced by, Demp-
ster, who held the Wildcats scoreless.

Spikes, Trinity’s star fielders was the hit-

double, a single and walking once out of his
four trips to the plate. Laird demonstrated
his versatility by playing jam-up ball in left
