Work On Library
To Begin In June

By JOHN CASSELS
Staff Writer

The E. H. Little Library is
scheduled to be under construc-
tion by June 1-15.

Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver C. Meetze is presently com-
pleting specifications to be sub
mitted to contractors next week.

Earlier in the spring, the
physical plant personnel in-
spected the present union for
capital equipment to be sal-
vaged when the union is razed.
The mechanical systems, i.e.
electronic equipment and sound
panels, will be moved to the
Guest House, which will be the
temporary union next year.

Hardware and doors will be
saved if there is immediate
future use for them, but costs
of long-term storage are prohi-
bitive.

The cost-of-labor rise over the
last few years has done away
with the worth of salvaging
brick.

Details of the library were
received by the college last
week. The Library Planning

Absentee Votes Due
For May 6 Primary

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

The 1972 elections are the first
in which absentee ballots will
be available for the North Caro-
lina primary elections. Those
Students wishing to exercise
their voting power may wish to
follow the prescribed procedure
to vote absentee in the May 6,
1972, primary election.

Anyone who is registered to
vote in North Carolina, affiliated
with a political party, and ex-
pects to be out of the county
on voting day may request an
application for am absentee
ballot. This request must be
received by the county election
board before May 2.

The election board will then
send an Official Application
which must be returned by
mail. The board will then send
the absentee ballot.

After voting, the ballot must
be notarized and then returned
to the election board before
hoon, May 3.

Committee is now
them for errors.

Within the next week Meetze
hopes to be able to turn over
the approved blueprints, along
with the specifications for the
razing and salvaging of the
union, to Clark, Nexsen and
Owen. The architectural firm
will then submit the plans and
specifications to contractors on
a prepared list.

The contractors will submit
sealed bids within three or four
weeks for the entire job of
razing the union and building
the new library.

Since bids will not be opened
until the latter part of May, the
contractor will operate on a
tight schedule. It is expected,
however, that the union will be
tazed and construction begun
on the library by June 15.

Sandwich Man Berger
Keeps Tradition Going

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

Through the cooi of the eve-
ning sounds the call of the sand-
wich man—knock, knock ‘“‘sell-
ing sandwiches.” Or as Shake-
Speare said ‘‘What say you to a
piece of beef and mustard?”

The sandwich man—as he is
known to most, is Jim Berger,
a senior and in his second year
of selling sandwiches (he also
sold them as a sophomore). He
is not the first and may not be
the last to do so. Sandwiches in
some form have been sold in
the dorms for at least the past
four years, and Berger says,
“They will continue to be sold
by someone as long as it is prof-
itable.”

It is profitable. Berger makes
and sells five dozen sandwiches
five days a week. He estimates
that a sandwich costs him
“somewhere in the neighbor-
nood of 30 to 33 cents to make.”
They are sold for $.50, and Ber-
ger makes about $50 each week.
He sees it an opportunity to
turn his ‘‘labor into profit,” but
also feels he is providing a ser-
vice by selling them.

Two years ago the price of a

sub sandwich was 40 cents. It

has been as low as 35 cents in
the last few years. Berger says
that most of his customers don't
complain about the price, and
he feels he gives value for the
money. The rising cost of meat
and bread was sighted by him
as causing the increase in sand-
wich prices.

“I spend -between three and
four hours each day in making
and selling sandwiches,” says
Berger, but he doesn’t think the
job places a burden on his study-

ing. He has found that in a nor-
mal week sandwiches sell best
on Sunday and Thursday nights
and for some reason Tuesdays
are very slow.

Of the three types of sand-
wiches which he sells, Berger
Says that subs have traditional-
ly been in the most demand.
However, he added, “right now
it is neck and neck between all
three types.” In addition to the
subs Berger sells beef and tur-
key sandwiches.

“At the beginning of the year
freshmen were the biggest buy-
ers,” Berger said. “But now
sophomores and especially Belk
Dorm buy the most. Of the
freshman dorms Watts buys
very few, and Cannon buys the
most. SentelHle falls somewhere
in between the two.”

A hard core of addicts buy
sandwiches every night, howev-
er. Berger notes that a major-
ity buy them about three out of
the five days that he.sells them.

Berger finds his job enjoy-
able. ‘‘Everybody is interesting
to talk to and I get to walk
around and if anything is hap-
pening I get to see it,” he said,
“and I’ve walked or been in-
vited in cn just about every-
thing.”

Berger says he has noticed
that people always want a sand-
wich after smoking grass. ‘‘I
guess marijuana breeds hunger
and hunger breeds sandwich
buying.”
