Spinning

Somewhere in rooms there lights and people who
sit reading or just sitting while a TV buzzes
on an “oldie-but-goldie.”

And a woman wishes she given “him” another chance
and a man drinks ’cause “she” ain’t worth the
ground she walks on.
And somewhere an old man in a flannel robe waits
for his eyes to grow heavy while he misses his
wife ’cause she was all he had...and the world

a on twirling and going while lonely folks

ink lonely thoughts ’cause the world’s hell when you sit and spin. alone.

“Not So Average Stereotyped Nigger’”’

You secretly wish you could shoot all the wine-heads
on the corner ’cause you hate being labeled for the
stupid stuff they pull.

And when they pass the bottle your way you feel the
urge to vomit ’cause, naw, it ain’t cool to ‘mack and
laan” on a dingy corner in the cold autumn wind and,
naw, it ain’t the politics, baby, of nothing.

When you hear the fat white men talking ‘bout their

being tired of supporting “those” people on welfare.

You want to yell at the top of your lungs, “Look, |

work and dream of the day my kids will go to college, too!”
Yeah, you want to prove you ain’t your average stereotyped
nigger.

..and when your kids don’t happen to be smart as a
pal you’re still proud and show them love ’cause your
Christmases are happy anyway...
