Learn to wine and dine like a gourmet
(or how to really impress a date for only $12)

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

Are you the type of person who “likes
and is an excellent judge of fine foods
and drinks?” If so, you would fit New
World Dictionary’s definition of a gour-
met. But even if you’re just a hungry
student who’s sick of beer and pizza,
you should reserve a seat at the Gour-
met Society Dinner Wednesday, April
11, at 7 p.m.

What distin-

met,” said Pritchard.

* This is the Gourmet Society’s sixth
year. New members are selected every
term to offer a fresh perspective, said
Pritchard. “Each dinner reflects the
committee.”

The committee selects every detail of
the food and wine for the meal. For
example, this term’s dinner features the
salad after the main course. The com-

mittee’s third meeting was devoted to
choosing the perfect wines to comple-
ment the meal. Discussion typically
went as follows:

“Anyone entranced by any of these?”
asked Pritchard after serving two can-
didate wines to compliment the cheese
and fruit.

“No,” said Bob Manning, committee

_ member and professor of physics and

humanities.

“That’s why we’re here,” said
Pritchard, as he requested three more
choices be brought out for tasting.

All said and done, Pritchard esti-
mates that a comparable meal at a res-
taurant would run $45-50 a person.
Tickets for this dinner cost $3 for stu-
dents on meal plans, $6 for all other
students and $9.25 for faculty, staff and

spouses. The meal is re-

guishes plain good
eating from “fine”
food and drink? The
committee of seven
faculty, staff and stu-
dents who took three
meetings to plan the
meal strove to find
that distinction. Pro-
fessional guidance
came from commit-
tee regulars Carl
