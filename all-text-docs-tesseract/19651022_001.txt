INCREASED CLASS UNITY

Faculty Favors Delayed Rush

By FRANK FLEMING
Oavidsonian Steff Writer

Faculty response to the
question “Has delayed rush
been beneficial?” has in-
dicated a general commend-
ation for the new system.

Among the most ardent sup-
porters was Dr. William B.
Hight. dlrector of student coun-
seling. Calling the present plan
of rush ‘“‘a definite change for
the better,” Dr. Hight explained,
“The freshmen seem to have
made a better overall adjust-
ment to Davidson College. They
fee] more competent to deal with
their problems and show less
frustration.”

Dr. Hight added, “From my
point of view these boys are a
joy to counsel. They seek help
in establishing study schedules

_ or vocational plans. There seems

to be more class pride and no
feeling of rejection. So far there
have been none of the usual
freshman inquiries about chang-
ing schools.”

Dr. J. Alexander McGeachy
noted the academic results of
delayed rush in his freshman
Humanities class: “The boys
have a better opportunity this
year.. The absence of fraternity
pressure at the start of the sem-
ester has helped their class
work.”

Dr. Philip Secor pointed out
that both freshmen and upper-
classmen now have more time
for studies. He added, “I am
opposed to rush altogether and
not sympathetic to fraternities;
rush should not interfere with
school at any thme.”

Yet Dr. Secor did mention two
positive effects of the delayed

plan: “Through the dorm visit.
ations the freshmen are more
available to the faculty. Also
they’re more availeble to other
activities, such as the YMCA."

In a comparison of last year's
freshmen with the present ones,
Professor Charles Cornwell call-
ed the latter “more alert in
class, more active, more uni-
fied, and more interested in
work. They evaluate people
without benefit of badge - — as
individuals.”

Although Dr. J. G. Martjn has
not noticed any academic
changes, he applauded the social
innovations: ‘‘The Social Coun-
cil has done a commendable job
and has provided a lot of im-
provements”

Dr. Thomas 0. Pinkerton, hav-
ing returned after a year in Ger-
many, has noticed ‘‘an improved

alertness and class perform.
ance.” He added, “The frater-
nities seem to be in the twilight
zone; they need a clearer idea
on the spirit of rush.”

Dr. Samuel D. Maloney, a
member of the Social Life Eval-
uation Committee, also com-
mented on the problem of “‘un-
natural separation of freshman
and upperclassmen in the dorm.
itories, not to mention the big
handicap in transportation.”

Dr. Maloney stressed the posi-
tive aspects, such as the “‘jn-
creased class unity. Also fresh-
men have a bigger chance to
decide for themselves this year."

Dr. R. D. Kaylor saw the
initial advantage mentioned
above but looked ahead to the
next two months for conclusive
evidence.

attempt to grace heaven with
slow dance music in the Morris-
on Room. Both dances will con-
clude at 2:30.

Most fraternities will also have
combo parties tonight.

Saturday begins bright and
éarly with a 3:00-4:30 breakfast
in the Union Cafeteria, sponsor-
ed by the Social Council.

“This is a new idea,” says
Social Council President Dan
Campbell, ‘‘but we hope it will
go over real well. Everybody
usually wants something to eat
after fraternity parties, so this
should be a success.”

Judging for the IFC Home.
coming Display Contest will take
place at 1! a.m. tomorrow. with
the 12 fraternities, Lingle Manor
and the five freshman dormitory
sections competing for the.
awards of fifteen, ten, and five
dollars for the top three dis-
plays.

At noon tomorrow a pre-game
barbeque for students and alum-
ni will be held on the lawn in
front of the Union and in the
basement of Chambers. Tickets
for this meal are by advance
purchase only.

Kickoff time for the Davidson-
VMI football encounter is 2 p.m.,
with the Wildcats going after
their first Homecoming victory
since 1961, when Presbyterian
fell to the delight of the alumni.

Homer’s contingent will be
trying to bounce back from last
Saturday's loss to William and
Mary by registering their fourth
win of the year, while the Key-
dets will be trying to break into
the win column after five
straight losses.

Halftime will feature a pa-
rade of the Homecoming Queen
candidates around the field and
the crowning of the 1965 Queen
by Penny Clark.

Following the game will be
an open house on the fraternity
court for returning alumni.

A charcoal hamburger supper,
also on the lawn in front of the
Union, will be held from 5 to
6:30 under the sponsorship of
the Social Council; tickets for
this event must also be pur-
chased in advance.

Chambers Auditorium is the
scene of the Social Council's
Homecoming concert from 7:30-
10.30 p.m. tomorrow, with both
the Modern Folk Quartet and
The Platters providing the en.
tertainment.

“The Modern Folk Quartet

was on ‘Shindig® last week, sing-
ing just folk music, and they
were really good'’, commented
Campbell. ‘“‘However, they also
have begun playing English-type
rock and roll, calling themselves
‘Your Friends’ when they do,
and they did real well when I
heard them in San Francisco.”

The Platters, of course, have
been turning out top sellers
since their recording of “Only
You" in 1955, and since then
their hits have included ‘‘Harbor
Lights,” “The Great Pretender,”

_ “My Prayer,” “The Magic” and

“Twilight Time.”

A combo dance in the Union
from 10:30-2:30, featuring the
Monzas, and several fraternity
combo parties will conclude the
official events of Homecoming.

‘Homecoming is always the
biggest weekend of the year in
terms of numbers of guests and
dates,’ noted Mrs. Peter Nich-
ols. supervisor of dormitories,

Trustees To Combine
Business, Festivities

Davidson's Board of Trustees
convened today on campus to
hold a regular business session
and to participate in the home-
coming festivities.

The executive committee met
at 9:15 a.m. to set up the agenda
for the regular business ses-
sion, which began at 10:30. At
this session the Trustees were
considering both old and new
business concerning the school.
This is the second consecutive
year that the 48 Trustees have
decided to hold a fall meeting.

At the regular business ses-
sion, President D. Grier Martin
presented his annual report con-
cerning the changes and ac-
complishments of the college in
the past year. Also on the agen-
da were two topics of old busi-
ness carried over from the
spring meeting.

There was a second reading

ing list for rooms in Belk and| of the revision of the by-laws of

Richardson.”

the Trustees and of the new oath

to be administered to the mem-
bers of the faculty. If these mo-
tions are passed this time, they
will become incorporated into
the by-laws of the Trustees.

In addition, several commit-
tees appointed in the spring to
investigate pressing issues of the
college presented reports to the
Trustees. One such committee
presented the change in the rule
concerning the use of alcoholic
beverages, which needs only the
approval of the Trustees to be-
come part of the student re-
gulations.

Under the new ruling students
may consume alcoholic bever-
ages at any time that they are
away from the college campus,
but students are still prohibited
from consuming or being under
the influence of an alcoholic
beverage while within the town
limits of Davidson or on the
campus of the college, including
the lake campus.
