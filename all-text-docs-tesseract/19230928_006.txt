inent, being best known in scholastic
and oratorical circles. During his
four years, he was a member of the
Intercollegiate Debating team for
two years, president and critic of the
Philanthropic Literary Society, a
member of the Memir Society which

Besancon, in France, from which in-
stitution he received the Certificat
d'Etudes Francais.

Returning to America, he engaged
in work for one year and entered |
University of North Carolina in the!
fall of 1922, where he held the posi-
tion of Teaching Fellow and received
his degree of Master of Arts.

His Alma Mater called for his
service this year and he has returned
to teach in the halls in which only
two years ago he was the taught.
All Davidson welcomes Professor
srown,

Mr. Fred L. Dendy

Mr. Fred L. Dendy, of Gadsden,
Ala., comes to Davidson as profes-
sor of Public Speaking and Debate,
filling the vacancy caused by the
resignation of Mr, Wagner.

Mri Dendy graduated from Val-
paraiso University, in Indiana, and
completed his course there in 1921.
In addition to this training he has
taken special courses in the Univer-
sity of Chicago and the University of
Indiana. While in college Mr.
Dendy was president of his class all
four years and in his Senior year
was honored with the presidency of
the Y. M. C. A.

His work since graduation has
consisted of one year in business in
Los Angeles, Cal., as professor of
public speaking and director of
dramatics in El Paso Junior College,
and one year in chautauqua work as
an impersonator and actor.

Mr. W. M. Mebane

Mr. W. M. Mebane, of Dublin, Va..
graduate in the class of ’18, comes
back to Davidson this year in the
capacity of an assistant in the
Physics Department. Mr. Locke
Currie, who filled this position last
year, has gone to Cornell University,
to take post-graduate work in
physics.

While at Davidson Mr. Mebane
made a very creditable showing in
the Physics department, was inter-
ested in the work, and is very ca-
pable of filling the position to which
he has been elected. He was very
prominent in the athletic activities
of his class.

After Mr. Mebane left Davidson
he went to Blacksburg, Va., where
he took a special course in Mechani-
cal Engineering at V. P. I. He then
spent some time at Niagara Falls, N.
Y., engaged in chemical engineering.
For the last year or two he has been
engaged in business at his home.

Coach C. R. Rawson

Four full teams of verdant new
boys have been daily practicing the
pigskin art for a week behind the
tennis courts, and already signs are
appearing that indicate a hard day
for any team that may meet them on
the gridiron. Of course there is a
reason, and Clarence Rawson, grad-
uate of the University of Georgia, is
the cause of it all.

Coach Rawson is not only a pro-
ducer of athletes, but he is an all-
round athlete himself. He not only
made his letter at Georgia in base-
ball and basketball for four years,

baseball player he handled the re-
ceiving end of the battery. As a

guard position in the famous Georgia
defense. During the War Rawson
played on the Camp Hancock foot-
ball team, playing in the backfield
along with Howard Berry, the all-
American half-back.

For the past five years Rawson
has coached some of the best prep
teams in Georgia. He was coach at,
G. M. C., which is noted in Georgia
for its hard-hitting teams, for one
year; and: at Riverside Military
Academy, which is always a likely
candidate for all-State honors in
Georgia, for three years. Last year
he turned out stellar squads in foot-
ball, basketball, and baseball

already long list of valuable con-
tributions to the “honor of old
Davidson”

Coach S. D. Tilson
In Coach Tilson) Davidson has
without a doubt one of the best line
coaches to be found in the South.
His football career began at V. P. I.
shortly after matriculating there.
Tilson came to V. P. I. straight from
a large ranch in Texas with his six-
shooter still attached to his belt, it
is said, ready to fight*his way
through. the hardships of a Fresh-
man’s life.
A football was an entirely new
thing to this large cowboy from
Texas. The game fascinaed him

port for practice. His size
Strength and fighting spirit was
strong enough recommendation for |
the football coach, who immediate-|
ly saw that Tilson was the find of;

for himself as a truly great tackle.
He was All-Southern tackle for
three years. Last year, besides
holding the captaincy of the strong
Teck team, his name won a prom-
inent place on the All-Southern and
All-South-Atlantic honor rolls, Hats
off to Coach Tilson! May his suc-|
cess as our coach be as complete as
the success which he has enjoyed as
a player.

Mr. D. B. VanSant

Mr. D. B. VanSant has © been
secured by the college to take over
that part of Mr. Jackson’s work per-
taining to. the grounds and build-
ings, the latters department having
assumed such proportions in the
past few years that another man
Was needed,

Mr. VanSant is an expert Civil
Engineer, having ‘graduated from
the Civil Engineering Department
of N.C, State. While at N.C. State,
he held a prominent place in the stu-
dent activities. During his Fresh-
man year he so led his classmates
that at the end of the year he was
elected president of the Sophomore
class. He was elected president of
the student body in his Senior year
and hence attained the most coveted
honor at State. Mr. VanSant was
also an athlete of prominence, pla
ing center on the football team two
years. So well did he acquit himself,
that he was mentioned by several
coaches for an all-State birth.

Captain W. E. Weems

Davidson College is indeed fortu-
nate in having Captain Weems con-
nected with the local R. O. T. C. unit
this year. Captain Weems comes to
Davidson with a very broad ex-
perience, in student affairs, in mil-
itary, in Y. M. C. A. activities, Bible
classes and in athletics.

Captain Weems attended South-
western Presbyterian University, of
Clarksville, Tenn: After one year
at this institution, he became a cadet
at West Point, where his sterling
character made him a leader. His
first office was secretary of the Y,
M. C. A. and dtiring his Senior year
he was elected president of that or-
ganization. He was also on the job
when it came to other student ac-

light-heavy weight champion, in

cadet captain.

After graduating at West Point,
he went overseas, and there he serv-
ed as commander of the machine
gun battalion, in the 3d division.
When the war was over, he was de-
tailed as a machine gun instructor.
Here it might be mentioned that he
passed on the machine gun section
in the R. O. T. C. Manual studied
1ere.

He was then transferred to Fort
Benning, Ga., where he served as
instructor for two years. During
this time he played on the football
squad made up of officers, and
among their numerous opponents
they played the University of Geor-
gia and Clemson, He will probably
be used’ as an official for some of
the local Freshmen games this year.

Head Coach W. L. Younger

William Lee Younger, familiarly |
known as “Monk,” has taken hold |
of athletics at Davidson with the |
same aggressiveness and skill which
won him a most enviable record in|
his college days. |

Younger received his earliest train- |
ling in Lynchburg High School, go- |
ing then to Fishburne Military |
Academy, where Bill Fetzer was |

Duofold is invaluable to students
is because fluent writing induces flu-

thoughts if an unruly pen harries your
brain. But Duofold’s balanced swing,
its super-smooth point, its fit and
business-like feel in your hand, all give
your mind free rein!

Ask your student friends who use
this classic pen—they’'ll tell you they
would ratherlet go of seven dollars than
have to part with the faithful Duofold.

Its over-size ink capacity holds a
long-distance ink supply. And its point
is not only smooth as a polished jewel,
but no style of writing can distort it;
hence, a pen you can lend without fear.

Students call it the “All-American”
