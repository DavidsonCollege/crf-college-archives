Terry cites irresponsibility

[Continued from page 2]

It begins with the proverbial
water fights. We have not

been adament toward prosecu- +

tion either from the Dean’s
office or the Hearing commit-
tee,’’ said Terry.

Terry emphasized that most
of the vandalism was because
of carelessness. He believed
most students were not mali-
cious but were simply involved
with pranks. Terry said that a
high incidence of destruction
came about because students
were playing with frisbees or
balls in the dormitories.

“T think we can rationalize
most anything away that we
want to. The fact is that

damage is being done to
materials. It costs,’’ said
Terry.

“I do not think the average
Davidson student is mali-
cious. Rather he is reluctant to
live up to his responsibilities
to himself, the college and to
other people’s property,” con-
tinued Terry.

Terry pointed out that there
had been an increase in the
seriousness of inter-dormitory
vandalism.

“This year seems to have a

more flagrant type of van-

dalism. In confrontations be-
tween Sentelle and Cannon,
Cannon has called security
three times. This represents a
special situation when stu-

dents have to do this,’’ said
Terry.

Meetze suggested that the
affects of vandalism on maint-
enence personnel who had to
fix them had not been good.

“If you call the same maint-
enance people to replace the
same window they suffer from
hurt morale. A lot of them are
proud of their work and have
to be on call 24 hours a day for
essential repairs. After awhile
they begin to feel that the
administration is somewhat
negligent--and it is a fact that
we are letting it happen.

You can’t control it under a
system of intellectual freedom
which we have set up as a
standard,” said Meetze.

BROKEN WINDOWS: Vandalism is
increasing on the Davidson
campus

Bunting will read

Basil Bunting will be on the Davidson campus
Thursday, April 15. Bunting, one of the foremost modern
poets was influential in the development of objectivism.
Bunting was born in Scotswood on Tyne, England, in
1900. He was educated at a Quaker public school and at
the London School of Economics. He has spent time in
prison for declaring himself a conscientious objector
during World War I. He has rubbed elbows with the likes
of Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound, and W. B. Yeats.

Baraka’s lines elicit empathy

By BILL PITMAN
Staff Writer

The Rockefellers, DuPonts,
and company comprise ‘‘that
handful of vampires who con-
trol the United States.”’

“The only practical revolu-
tion is armed violent over-
throw of the state mechan-
ism.”

‘ “Stalin was a great revolu-
tionary...Stalin’s work and
theories are guiding lights to
the people of the world.”

Did LeRoi Jones say those
things? No, of course not; he
was that militant black
nationalist of the late sixties.
You know, the young talent
who won the Obie for the best
American play of 1964, the
“Dutchman.’’ He was on his
way to “‘success”’ then.

The toast of the town,
LeRoi went to all the nice
parties and knew all the good
people. He was the up and
coming fair-haired boy of the
stage, so to speak. Then, to
everyone’s shock and dismay,
he threw all of that white glory
back at the establishment.

Jones left the established
theater and went back to
Harlem, and then to, Newark,
back to enlighten his people.

Maybe those at the nice
parties didn’t hear what LeRoi
was saying, or maybe they
thought it was just rhetoric or
some new fad. Whatever, he
really meant it when he called
“whitey”’ the enemy; his hate
was real and deep and violent.
That pure raw hate came out

but the sixties have come and
gone.

No, LeRoi Jones did not
speak in Love Monday. We
heard a different man, or so he
seemed, Imamu Amiri
Baraka. Mr. Baraka, the
gifted poet-dramatist-
novelist, spoke on art. The
audience soon discovered,
however, that the art of
interest to the writer was
revolution. ‘‘Poetry should be
a tool ‘of revolution,”

~ This ‘‘revolutionary
struggle,’”’ he went on to say,
is that of the black and white
workers, the proletariat,
against the owners of the
means of production.
Obviously, Baraka is a
Marxist. Violent revolution,
dictatorship of the proletariat,
instant happiness for the
massess -- he is in on the whole
act. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Ho
Chi Minh -- they are his heroes

You are the petty-bourgeoisie,
indoctrinated by your culture
to support the __ elite
‘‘vampires’’ who control
society and drain off all the
milk and honey. You can be
saved, he instructed, if only
you forsake your middle-class
ways and join the workers in
the revolution.

After his talk, Baraka read
some of his poetry which is
soon to be published in a book,
Hard Facts. The first poem,
“Gibson,” relates the story of
a friend of Baraka’s who
became one of the ‘‘few black
faces in high places.’’ It
describes his friend’s success
in politics as a token black, his
travels, and his eventual
emergence as a defender of the
white establishment.

Another poem, ‘Real Life,’’
was what he called his ‘‘post-
Watergate’ commentary. It
hits hard at Nixon, who snorts

cocaine, his wife Pat, who
relieves herself on the rug and
rolls:in it, and the team of
Jerry and Rocky, who are
respectively dumb and
corrupt. The wealthy Vice-
president is a favorite target of
Baraka, and was honored by
another work, ‘‘Rockerfeller

Is Your Vice-president and
your Mama Don’t Wear No
Drawers.”

Despite the radical political
views he presents, and the
unceasing barrage of obscen-
ities, the man has great

ability: he can make people
feel. Even if you do not agree
with his philosophy, you can-
not but experience a bit of the
misery that Baraka’s people
experience. You are forced to
see the problem in all its subtle
magnitude and to feel the
anger, the burning anxiety of
the poet. He shows you why
his heart is so eaten away by
hate and violence.

LeRoi Jones’ political phil-
osophy is different, but his
heart seems to have softened
but little.
