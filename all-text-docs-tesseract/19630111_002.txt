A More Efficient System?

Met a friend of ours during the
holidays who announced with not a
little dramatic fervor that he was
“freel” We pushed aside our books
and papers for a minute and asked
him just what he meant by that state-
ment.

He pointed to the small mound of
books and papers and asked, “What
are you doing with them?” We said
that we were trying to prepare for
exams and the frenzy preceding them
by using a little of the holiday time
to study.

“That is what 1 am free from dur-
ing the holidays,” he said. “I have
taken my exams and am now resting
and making resolutions for the rest
of the school year.”

He was. of course, under the
quarter system.

And he turned out to be quite a
promoter for the quarter or Chicago
plan. Since we were about in the right
mood, we shoved the books still fur-
ther away and asked him to go on.

He pointed out that the quarter
system divides the year into four
parts. The fall quarter runs from Sep-
tember to December with the Christ-
mas recess forming a natural break
between fall and winter quarters. The
winter quarter goes till mid-March
and the long weekend break after
exams serves as spring vacation. We
mentioned that this seemed to be the
answer for some of our faculty mem-
bers who didn’t like the way Christ-
mas and spring breaks interrupted
the thread of their courses. Our friend
acknowledged this and said that this
advantage seemed to far outweigh
the inconveniences of three exams
and three registrations during the
regular school year.

He went on to explain that the
spring quarter ends in June and three
days later the summer quarter be-

gins. In this way his school is operat-
ing at full capacity the year around
and is able to handle many more stud-
ents than a school on the semester
system. He said that the summer quar-
ters are usually very well attended.
We thought of the rising waters of
Lake Norman and imagined that Dav-
idson could probably count on quite a
few students during the summertime
too.

Our friend was particularly hap-

py with the summer quarter because.

it meant that he, by attending two of
them, was easily going to be able to
graduate in three years.

We asked him if he could possibly
cover a semester of material in a
course that ran for only one quarter.
He explained that the normal load is
only three courses at any one time
and that each of these courses meets
five times a week. In this way each
course meets at least as many times
as in a semester and students have the
weekends free to boot. The real ad-
vantage of this, though, is in concen-
tration of subject material.

A student who takes only three
courses can concentrate more on each
individual subject. This aspect as-
sumes particular importance in the
realm of languages.

Our animated friend proclaimed
that having to study and speak Ger-
man every weekday had certainly been
a boon to him!

At this point, he looked at his
watch and said he wanted to go back
and catch the rest of a bowl game
and get ready for a date that night.
As he left us, we thought of the ap-
proaching exams and papers, and his
quarter system seemed like some fairy
tale in a far-away land.

But maybe he had an idea
there. ..

A Service To The Century

To most of us, the Peace Corps
means little more than something
about: Sargent Shriver and the New
Frontier. But to the 5000 volunteers
at work in 42 countries around the
world, the Peace Corps is an oppor-
tunity for service and education.

In an appeal to college students,
Director Shriver has said: “The world
is coming alive. New countries are
bursting with activity. In Latin Ameri-
ca and the Middle East, in Africa and
Asia, there is an urgent desire to leap
into the twentieth century.

“The Peace Corps is part of our
effort to help make that leap forward
a success. It is a part of our effort to
help in the world-wide assault against
poverty, hunger, ignorance and
disease—a roots, rice roots
volunteer effort of free men.”

Although a college degree is not
a prerequisite for projects, it is
considered a definite asset, and most
volunteers are either college students
or graduates. Copies of the winter
issue of the Peace Corps News, featur-
ing pictures and stories about volun-
teers from colleges and universities,
will be distributed in a future issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Some colleges and universities
give academic credit for Peace Corps
work, primarily in language and cul-
tural studies, although independent
study pro may also be carried
out, ee ded they don’t interfere
with the basic purposes for which the

volunteer is serving overseas.

Davidson students have remained
largely uninterested in the Peace
Corps. The reasons vary: lack of in-
formation, military service require-
ments (deferment is granted for over-
seas work), or apathy. Chaplain Will
Terry has assumed the job of liaison
for the Corps at Davidson, and is
anxious to supply information to any
students who are interested in ex-
ploring the opportunities this pro-
gram offers. A test for those interest-
ed in becoming volunteers will be
given in Charlotte on Jan. 26.

We frequently complain of the
provincialism of life at Davidson and
a too-conservative atmosphere that
stunts our “liberal” education. The
Peace Corps offers a chance for serv-
ice to the underdeveloped countries
coupled with an opportunity for in-
tellectual and often spiritual growth.

The Peace Corps is a challenge to
the college graduate to give of himself
and represent America to backward
people, many of whom see the Com-
munist promise “to each according tc
his need” as the only escape from
poverty.

Too often we speak in general
terms of “helping mankind” while
ignoring the particular events which
make progress possible. The Peace
Corps offers a chance to participate
in such particular events. May we
prove equal to the challenge.

Spratt Concludes NSA
Series: ‘Wait And See’

BY JOHN SPRATT
NSA Coordinator

In the past several articles, I
have tried different approaches
in presenting the National Stud-
ent Association. The first was
rather general while the last
covered some of the specifics of
the NSA constitution. Countless
questions remain, but perhaps
the answers to two general
queries can summarize some of
what has been left unmentioned.

First, is NSA worth the price
for dues and the time for par-

LETTERS TO

ticipation? This question cannot
really be answered with finality.
As of now, we can only specu-
late. It should be clarified, how-
ever, that there is no intention
of organizing an “open branch”
of NSA on the Davidson cam-
pus.

There is little use and less
sense in squeezing another
organization into an already
muchorgenized campus. In-
stead, NSA will be used to
supplement the work of other
bodies, the Student Council,

THE EDITOR

Maloney: ‘Bomb Shelters

Are Positive
Maloney

Dear Editor:

Few things are as alarming
to a professor as
aware of impressions he has in-
advertently left with students.
My only claim to kinship with
Biblical prophets is that they
too were misunderstood.

In reference to Mr. Loflin's
article on the Civil Defense
shelter plan in the December
7th DAVIDSONIAN, I would like
to correct, the following impres-
sions:

1, The solutions to the prob-
lem of the world’s population
growth lie in birth control, in-
creased. industry and food pro-
duction, and better food distri-
bution; not the inevitability of
atomic war.

2. My primary motive for
constructing @ radietion shel-
ter was the conviction that
such shelters can be a positive
deterrent to nuclear attack.
A nation is less likely to at-
tack another nation known to
be well-prepared to survive
such en attack. The erticle on
my shelter in THE DAVID-
SONIAN last year made this
cleer.

Nuclear warfare can be con-
sidered inevitable only if we
relax our vigilance against
mechanical and human errors in
the handling of nuclear weap-
ons, or if.we exert less than our
best efforts in constant, patient,

Deterrents'

international diplomacy. As long
as nations stockpile nuclear
weapons, the possibility of such
a war is a reality we cannot pre-
tend does not exist.

T believe that families, institu-

becoming jong and communities should be

as realistic in making adequate
preparations for that emergency
is they are in matters of fire
prevention, vaccines, and health
and life insurance.

S. D. Maloney, Depatt-
ment of Bible and Religion,
Deputy Director of Civil
Defense for Davidson

Dear Editor:

Two-and-a-half-pats - on -the -
back for Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz
and his heroic little band of anti-
warmongers for their brave
Tally on Armistice Day. How
surprising to find that there are
still a few people who disap-
prove of war!

However, it seems that while
they were at it, they might just
as well have included a protest
against hate and envy and
greed, etc., etc., ete., and against
people who think they have
some sort of corner on truth. I'm
sure that such a protest would
accomplish a great deal, parti-
cularly if it were sponsored by
some of the professional “world-
savers” who seem to be so well
represented on the Davidson
campus.

John Woods

the YMCA, the Interzztionel
Relations Club.

One instance of such assist-
ance already in operation is our
affiliation, through NSA, with
Educational Travel Association,
lending aid to traveling students
and offering student tours
abroad. This program is being
combined with the YMCA cravel
program and handled by Dudley
Salley.

Another instance is our asso-
ciation, through NSA, with the
CCUN, Collegiate Council on the
United Nations, which is staging
a mid-south Model General As-
sembly in February.

A second question might be
posed of perheps further
reeching significance. Why al-
filiate with en organization
whose policies we disagree
with?

It is true that NSA has, at
times, elbowed its way down
crowded streets of opinion. It
has assumed questionable stands
on controversial issues and prob-
ably will continue to do 50.
However, I think we can weath-
er a little controversy—and
Probably to our benefit. Be-
sides, we are obligated to sup-
port no NSA policy with which
we disagree.

In time we may find NSA
completely irrelevant. As of yet,
we cannot be certain. Second
semester we will be implement-
ing some of their proposals, ap-
plying some of their sugges
tions. Only after we have seen
how the organization will work
at Davidson can we justifiably
commend or condemn it.

THE DAVIDSONIAN wel-
comes letters from any read-
er either in support of or
differing from its pollcies.
Letters should be typewrit-
ten, double-spaced, and
should not exceed 250 words.

We also will receive long-
er articles, but request that
they be cleared with the edi-
tor.

tn order to be printed in
the following issue, letters
should not be received leter
than 6 p.m. Wednesday. Ali
letters must be signed. The
mailing eddress is Box 218,

We will not publish anony-
mous letters untess the writer
consults the editor.

The Resolutions

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The following statements were submitted to the
Faculty Committee on New Year’s and Hannukah Reso-
lutions:

Charles Dana: Unless they re-name Belk Dormitory
for me, I'm going to stop my Calvin Contributions and
donate to other denominational schools—Assumption Col-
lege, Eastern Nazarene, Hebrew Teachers, like that.

Stu Jamison: (chairman, Film Committee): To pay
for our new equipment, I’m planning to cut out all arty,
obscure, nihilist presentations. We'll show Gene With The
Wind and Tobacco Road every night, unless we can work
out a co-op program with the Fox.

Dr. Schenck: I resolve to coach our cheerleaders so
they'll be better heard at noisy basketball games and so
they’ll say “Give ’em heck, ’Cats.”

Johnny Rogers (President, IFC): The IFC will do its
darndest to get the Drifters back for Midwinters, due to
popular response. ;

Mr. Stacks: I will devote 30% of the laundry’s income
to research in the ever-changing technological fields of
pants-pressing and button-smashing.

John Horton: I shall make it a point, whenever meet-
ing any prospective college students, to sell them on Dav-
idson, pointing out its liberal attitudes and. its unique
personal contact between students and administration.

Dr. Lilly: I'm sick of being a kindly old gent type,
and will revert to my secret desire of being a professional
gambler, complete with snarl, eyeshades, and brocaded
vest.

Cop Linker: To end the numerous protestations of -
moonlighting that have been leveled against me this past
year, I’m discontinuing my bread and sweet roll delivery
service to the dormitories. In the future all my efforts
will be directed against such consummate evil-doers as
visiting clergymen who try to park on campus without
parking stickers.

Dr. Abernethy: I will continue to place the initiative
to study on the students by granting them more than the
presently allowed cuts and refusing to check on their
day-to-day work by such high-school methods as writs.

Belk family: If the name of the new science building
is not changed to that of our family, Davidson College can
henceforth cease to expect financial assistance from us.
Let them look to the Harris-Teeters if that’s their idea of
gra e.

Dr. Clark: I resolve to give my old sneakers to the
YMCA, the rest. of my wardrobe to Pete Ney and Tiff
Harrington, and join the Peace Corps as an iron mucker.

Mimi Martin: If Daddy doesn’t stop leaving all the
lights in the Fine Arts Building on for me the nights of
fraternity parties, and stop making me sign that silly
pledge, I resolve to SCREAM.

C. Shaw Smith: It is my ambition for the coming
year to organize my sons into a football team, and de-
mand that they be allowed to represent the college next
season. oo

Chaplain Terry: I resolve to resolve once and for all
the mystery of students who every day stick their heads
in my office, glance around, and ask ‘“Where’s the Pen-
guin?”’

Dr. Plott: The Male Chorus will include in its reper-
toire for the coming year numerous Ferlin Huskey songs
and a trained chimp act (featuring Chuck Frew) in an
effort to receive a booking on: the Ed Sullivan Shoe.

President Martin: I resolve to devote hours of prac-
tice to becoming accomplished in the Wildcats “Let’s
Go!” hand clap, with which PM having considerable
trouble. Let’s see, clap, clap, clap- clap, clap- clap, clap,—
No. confound it! That’s not it. . .

Don Stowell: I resolve to do my best to discourage
THE DAVIDSONIAN and Bill Ferris from actively sup-
porting the Vagabonds. “Too many intellectuals spoil
the victuals.” or something like that.

Mrs. Moore: I will, in the coming months, open my
file of pin-ups which this office has confiscated through
the years and price them for quick sale. The money thus
realized, plus contributions from the fraternity court,
should be sufficient to put Pat through college.

Dean Burts: I resolve to check out of the Charlotte
Library and faithfully study Our Heritage of Hemp, Cord
in Our Culture, and Ties of Tradition. Then maybe I can
get my hands untied.

Emory U. Points Out
Need For Scientists

BY JEFF WAMPLER
Davidsonian Managing Editor

In response to the growing
need for graduates educated to
highest competence in biology,
chemistry, mathematics and
physics, Emory University has
instituted this year a modified
bachelor of science degree.

The basic core pf courses in
the humanities and social
sciences will remain an integral
part of the new B.S. .program.
The science department at
Emory feels one of the major
benefits is that students will be
able to identify themselves with
a quality science program.
