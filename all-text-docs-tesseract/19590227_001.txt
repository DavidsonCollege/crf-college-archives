Plans have b f .
ans have begun for an appearance by a group of Vice-Presidents of the Student Body, respectively, in in this morning’s after-chapel

voting. The balloting was the second run-off in the race, the first run-off having nar-
rowed the field down to Bootle, Stanley, Spiro, Macris, and Ervin Duggan.

College authorities an-
nounced this week that techni-
cians have already visited the
campus to examine the possi-
bility of broadcasting live from
Davidson.

“College Bowl” is a network
educational feature appearing
on Sunday afternoons. Compet-

This week the three candidates for the office of student body president were, ing four-man teams selected

quizzed by a DAVIDSONIAN staff member concernin ¢ 1
campus issues. Below are printed the answers of candidates Green, Huie and Liv- colleges

ingston.

What is the outlook for
next year’s student council,
now that the judicial func-
tion has been removed. What
do you feel the general func-
tion of the council and the
president should be?

Green: The main interest
will be implementing the new
Honor Court. This can be a
great step forward. Since the
council will be removed from
the judicial function it will
have a lot more to do along
the legislative line. My idea of
the office of president is that
he should . . . work to bring
the students closer to the facul-
ty and administration on mat-
ters of curriculum and so forth.
I feel that the council should
work to maintain thé interest
of this year’s council, to carry
forward the fine work done by
John Kuykendall and his coun-
cil.

Huie: I feel that the student
council should broaden its
scope, find areas in which oth-
er organizations haven't done
an adequate job. My purpose as
president would be to lead the
council in a more active role.
Specificially, this could be in
the areas of investigations,
recommendations and_ studies
by student committees on such
things as the cut system, cur-
riculum, vespers and chapel, or
any subject of student interest.

-

HUIE

I favor anything which would
give the student more oppor-
tunity to participate in student
government.

Livingston: The council's role
has heretofore been negative—
a sort of check. Now it has an
opportunity to become positive,
to create situations as well as
hendle them. Next year's coun-
cil will be precedent-making
rather than precedent-break-
ing. There are. three broad
areas of interest: the council
as a supervisory and orgapiza-
tional body; as a body which
will probe deeper into matters
such as stealing, drinking,
school spirit and attempt to re-

lieve present tensions; and as ;

a body to find and express the
voice of the student body to
faculty and administration.
NSA-WUS AFFILIATION
What are your views con-
cerning the student council’s
affilistion with the World
University Service end the
National Student Association?
Green: As for WUS, it could
be good at Davidson if enough
interest could be stimulated,
but I don’t think it should be
under the student council. This
could give the YMCA a shot
in the arm. The “Y" could do
a good job with it. NSA has a
tendency to be left-wing, radi-

cal, as shown by the legisla-’

tion passed at Chapel Hill last
year. Since it does have a shaky
reputation, I think our relation
should be formal and nothing
more.

Huie: Affiliation with NSA
and WUS would broaden the
scope of Davidson Student Gov-
ernment. The council is study-
ing N.S.A. now. I do favor
council participation in bring-
ing speakers on current affairs
to the campus, so long as it can
be done without overlapping
similar efforts by other groups.

Livingston: I feel -that the
council should maintain affilia-
tion with NSA in order to
strengthen our own position,
which is in disagreement with

Fiorida Presbyterian !

Selects Bevan Dean

Dr. John M. Bevan, Professor of Psychology, was,

officially selected as Dean of Students of Fforida Presby-
terian College last Friday. Dr. Bevan will assume his du-
ties this July 1. Thus far no one has been named to fill
his position on the Davidson faculty.

This newly conceived institu-
tion is the culmination of joint
plans begun in 1956 by the
Boards of Higher Education of
both the Southern and North-
ern Presbyterian churches. Stu-
dies were made of many out-
standing colleges throughout
the country and many of their
qualities are being incorporated
into the Florida institution. It
will be put into operation in
the fall of 1960 at St. Peters-
burg with a co-educational stu-
dent body which will have an
ultimate maximum of 1200.

Dr. Bevan is highly en-
thusiastic about the educa-
tional goals of the school.
“The emphasis is on the in-
dividual,” he said. “We will
try to give the student an
education tailor-made for

him. There will be no pre-
med or pre-law set up.”

The school will be on a three-
semester program. The middle
semester, which is only one
month long, will be used ex-
clusively for concentrated work
on a research paper. Seniors,
however, may use this period
to prepare for a comprehensive
exam in their major or begin
work on a thesis.

An Honors Course system
comparable to the one at Da-
vidson will be an integral por-
tion of the curriculum for the
junior and senior years. Fresh-
man will take a required course
in “Western Civilization” which

is to be taught by eleven pro-'ticipation. I feel that a reason-
fessors from the fields of His-; able number of scholarships is

ete.

A faculty committee has be-

four Davidson representatives.
After faculty nominations are
received, a series of elimina-
tions will. be held until four
students believed to have a su-

LIVINGSTON

ATHLETIC GRANTS
De you favor athletic sub-
sidization?

Green: I think we'd do well
to offer other scholarships in
minor sports, such as_ tennis,
golf and swimming. Athletic
scholarships should not in any
way lower the standards of the
schoo]. I feel that if we give
minor scholarships we'll be
able to maintain standards and
compete with anybody.

Huie: I would favor non-sub-
sidized athletics if the teams
we compete with do not sub
sidize. But if we remain in the
southern conference, 1 favor
the present set-up. e

Livingston: Athletic teams
are vital to generating school
spirit —- and so is student par-

every year by 1960.”

Total gifts to Davidson for

poses totaled $927,506 in the
