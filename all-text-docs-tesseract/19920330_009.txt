Yes, folks, it’s is that time of
year again when Hollywood’s best
and brightest gather for the presen-
tation of the annual Academy
| Awards. This year is historic be-
cause it is a year of many “firsts”:
the first Best Picture nomination
for an‘animated film (“Beauty and
the Beast) the first time'a mother
and daughter have been nominated
in the same year (Diane Ladd and
Laura Dern, both for “Rambling
Rose”), and John Singleton (“Boyz
N the Hood”) is the youngest di-
rector ever to receive a Best Direc-
tor nomination. However, despite
all these “firsts”, I am looking
forward to the Barbara Walters

than to the actual ceremony itself.

This past Friday the Discovery
Place in Charlotte began showing
“Rolling Stones At The Max,” a
89-minute concert video of the

Tour.” The film is the first concert
movie to be shot in OMNIMAX, a
large film medium which projects
an image five stories tall and wraps
180 degrees around the viewer.
pe Andre Picard, one of the film’s
| editors, was on handin Charlotte at
| thesneak preview to answer ques-
“| tions and explain the film’s devel-
*, | opment. Picard said the band was
S | looking to do something different
1 and then became intent on produc-
| inganOMNIMAXafter viewing a
ag. | film done in this format. Picard
i | called the film the “coming to-
| gether of two worlds - rock and roll
} and cinema.”
The movie has been a écitical
| and popular hit in the 19 giant-
1 screenOMNIMAX theaters which
| nowoffer the film. Charlotte is the
mostrecentcity to feature the film.

has a history of giving awards to
the most politically correct films
of the year instead of to those films
which are truly deserving. I am

film of all time. I’m sorry, but no

deny that Glenn Close should have
walked away with a statuette for
her role in “Dangerous Liaisons”

categories and offer my picks of :

the best performances from among
this year’s contenders.
Best Actor: Warren Beatty,

To date, the picture has earned
over $5,400,000 in box office re-
ceipts worldwide.

As the shows begins (actually
the movie is acompilation of three
shows performed in London, Turin,
and Berlin) the viewer is some-
what awestruck by the sheer size
of the screen. Although some in
the audience complained of dizzi-
ness, mostadjust to the nearly three-
dimensional image quickly.
OMNIMAX actually makes you
feel that you are at the show and it
is difficultto restrain yourself from
joining the crowd at Wembley
Stadium in cheering after every
song.
The music itself doesn’t disap-
point. Basically, the songs played

plus “Sad, Sad, Sad” and “Rock
anda Hard Place” from their latest
“Steel Wheels” album. From the
opening “Start Me Up” to the fi-
nale of “Satisfaction,” the Stones

Friends of the Arts, described
Prutsman’s final piece as being
“marvelously romantic” and “very
demanding.”

Prutsman has the distinction
of winning medals at both the 1990
Tchaikovsky International Piano
and Queen Elisabeth International

There are many actors who could

play into their fifties. The OMNI-
MAX format allows the viewer to
see every expression on the band
members’ faces and it is was clear
that they still enjoyed their work.
One highlight was the huge inflat-
able dolls that the band used as
props. Viewers are treated to a
close-up of Mick Jagger’s flirta-
tions with his oversized, helium-
holding “Honky Tonk Women.”
Forty-four speakers, situated in all
comers of Discovery Place’s plane-
tarium/theater, blast out 16,000
watts of power.

The OMNIMAX format is an
expensive and time consuming way
to make a movie. In order to pro-_
duce the large and clear images,

the film is shot at a rapid pace of

300 feet per minute. Since the
OMNIMAX< cameras eat up film
at a great clip, they can only hold
enough blank tape for seven min-

,utes. In the process of shooting the
