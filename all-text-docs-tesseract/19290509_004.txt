charge of the program and Eugene
Dubose led the singing assisted. by
Jimmy Johnson at the piano. Mrs.
Vowles and Eugene Dubose sang a
special duet.

After the responsive scripture read-
ing three members of the Freshman
class made short talks comparing life
to the daily cours o fthe sun. Chestér
Arnold taking as his text, “And Jesus
increased in wisdom and stature, and
in favour with God and man,” spoke
on the sunrise of life. He emphasized
the importance of starting out right
while we are still young and still able
to mold our characters. He urged us
to take stock of ourselves as we face
the future, to see if we are the givers
of, and if we have developed the rays
we want to tsick by us. Are we mas-
ters of our souls as was Christ?

Nat ‘Spier then discussed the sun in
the mid-day sky. Christ, the “Sun,”
sends forth his rays. Some receive
them and in turn radiate them out to
others, some fail to pass them on and
others are not even penetrated by
them. Christ lived a life of service.
What are we doing to further the ef-
fectiveness of that life? How closely
are we trying to follow his example?
May we live in such a way that men
may see our god works and glorify our
Father in Heaven.

The sunset of life was pictured by
Herbert Newman. He spoke of».the
sunset as the sure close of everyone’s
drama of life. No matter how beauti-
ful a sunset may be on an uninhabited
desert island no one can appreciate
it. And in the same manner the glory
and beauty of Christ are lost to the
world if we do not tell others of him.
Then there are things in our lives that,
as the clouds hide the sun, keep us
from having our full influence. When
we come to the sunset of our lives will
we be able to say with Paul, “T have
fought a good fight, I have finisi Yo, 7
course, I have kept the faith”?
