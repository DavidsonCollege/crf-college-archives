The Buford administration: articulating the vision

By Mary Care JALONICK

Executive Editor

When asked what nega-
tive things SGA senators might
say about his administration, War-
ren Buford takes a minute to think.

“That’s a hard question,” he
says, “I don’t want to sound like
I’m fishing for compliments.”

He doesn’t have to. No one
will say anything bad about him.

Tim Saintsing, who served
under Buford as an Independent
Senator last Spring, says, “I think

that his accessibility will be unri-
valed by any other SGA president.
I have really been able to use him
as a mentor. He has been a good
friend and a good president.”
Former SGA President Bill
Gullan, ’96, says: “As a person
Warren is first class both in ability
and personality. Virtually every
leader who sticks their neck out
engenders at least some bitterness
in others who may be ambitious or
seeking leadership roles them-
selves, but Warren amazingly leads
and has the respect, affection, and

cooperation of everybody.”

Buford ran unopposed last
year, a situation some attributed to
apathy but most attributed to the
fact that he was unbeatable. Dur-.
ing his four years on the SGA,
most people point to one thing that
has kept him so successful — ac-
cessibility.

Rusk representative Heather
Brown says she feels that Buford
has been “one of the best presi-
dents since I’ve been here. He is
really in touch with students, and
he is a great liaison with faculty

and administration.”

Buford feels that “the idea of
he president is to articulate the
vision of the students.”

A major factor in his adminis-
tration was dedication to his prom-
ises. He distributed a flyer last
January outlining his goals for the
year. Twelve months later, a re-
view of the sheet shows that he
kept them constantly in mind.

He proposed a rides commit-
tee, better town-gown relations, a
more active Council on Academic
Affairs, academic minors, and bet-

ter polling and response action from
the SGA. Of these, he has seen
considerable progress. He is cur-
rently working on a rides commit- .
tee, held a town dinner with mem-
bers of the SGA, helped the Coun-
cil on Academic Affairs with its
successful crusade for minors, and
established “Dorm Storm,” which
tabulated student opinion and pre-
sented as a resource for different
departments to use.

Prediction is an unsure sci-

of courses is never easy. Still,
when many students found them-

But mostclasses, suchas biol-

notoriously difficult to secure
places, have open spots, with the
exception of what are commonly
referred to as “baby bio” and
“kiddie chem.”

Last year at Charleston the
result was the same, but getting
two wins was much more difficult.
The men’s swimming and diving
team pulled away from the Col-
lege of Charleston to win comfort-
ably, but the women left thinking
they had lost by a point. Later, a
|scoring error changed the result

and gave the Wildcats a one point
victory.

This Saturday atCannon pool,
it wasn’t even close.

Both the men and women
exhibitioned (didn’t score points)
the last two events, and they still
won handily (women 146 - 83,
men 128 - 89).

“We’re doing really well.
There were a lot of strong perfor-
mances. I’m: looking forward to

Duke now (next weekend). We

want to beat them,” Mike McCabe}’

said. “A lot of our improvement is
just the strength of the freshmen.
Some of them are standouts, but
we're just a lot deeper. There is no
way we could have gone 1-2-3-4
last year in any event. This year we
did it in three or four.”

Actually, the Wildcats swept

department chairs, which deal in
such probabilities semester after
semester, would know what to ex-
pect from course enrollments.

By most accounts, they do.
Registrar Polly Griffin points to a
recent printout of Spring 1997
courses, which lists each class of-
fered, its ceiling, the number of
students enrolled, and the number
of places remaining, saying, “I
don’t have any concrete evidence
that this semester has been more
problematic than previous semes-
ters.”

Certainly, most course enroll-
ments reflect that. Perennial fa-
vorites such as' English seminars,

gauging course interest is political
science. Of the 16 courses the
department is offering this semes-
ter, not including independent stud-
ies, tutorials, and theses, nine go
over the listed ceiling. . Five of
those are seminars, a number po-
litical science professor Lou
Ortmayer believes is perhaps more
than his department has ever of-
fered.

Professor Thomas Kazee,
chairman of the Political Science
department, says, “The demand for
the seminars surprised us,” which
he partially attributes to the re-
quirements for the major. Political

Students return from abroad to a new house

By NARESH NAGELLA
News Editor

Due to unusually large num-
bers of juniors returning from
abroad this semester, RLO did not
have enough rooms to accomodate
all of them.

Still, with some quick think-
ing and fast work by the Physical
Plant, they were able to create a
new Residence House over Winter
Break to provide on campus hous-
ing for eight men who would have
otherwise been literally left out in

the cold. The result was “507
Concord.

The newest addition to cam-
pus housing is next to the Applied
Psychology building. It joins the
Manse as another housing option
that is not North of Chambers.

The house had to have a bath-
room added along with the cus-
tomary wardrobes, dressers, desks,
and phone lines in each room.

RLO director Kurt Holmes
says the college is “taking a sub-
stantial loss on theresidence,” since
preparing it will not be covered by

the student’s housing fees, which
remained at the double room rate.

Junior Resident Sean Keesee
says, “I enjoy being able to live in
a place with a kitchen and nice
porch. It makes the walk to school
a little more bearable.”

RLO intended to keep the
dorm for future use, but it looks as
if town zoning laws will limit its
occupancy to just this semester.
The Manse, however, will be a
new housing option that students
can choose in the upcoming lot-

tery.
