In American Economic Future

By NED PARKER
Staff Writer

Kenneth Boulding, economist
and Renaissance man, offered
hope, encouragement, and a
sense of direction to the
Davidson community last
Thursday and Friday.

During his visit to the campus
as a Reynolds lecturer,
Boulding talked of the economy,
social dynamics, world
problems, history, spiritual
needs, and of himself.

“The present state of the
American economy needs to be
viewed in light of the Great
Depression of the thirties. I first
came to this country in 1932 when

Town Council InactionFueled

By Lack Of Available Monies

News Analysis

Meeting with state experts
has done little to move the
Davidson Town Council closer
to their expresed goal of
providing some kind of low rent
housing for the poor.

The council met with officials
of the Farmers’ Honie Ad-
ministration and a state agency
designed to assist small rural
communities with problems
such as housing.

At an October meeting with
two college students, Davidson
Mayor Tom Sadler insisted that
“as people of good will we can
work together to solve the
problems of our community. We
have the means to do so, and I
believe we also have the will.”
Monday evening the Mayor
suggested to the council,
“maybe we will not be able to
solve the problem in Davidson--
and we should be willing to ad-
mit this.”

. Sadler’s change of mind came
after the Farmers’ Home Ad-
ministration informed the Town
Concil that community surveys
showed the average income of
the poverty areas too low to
enable the FHA to provide large
scale monetary assistance. In
addition, a state expert in the
area of small community
problems painted a bleak pic-
ture of the availability of gover-
nment money.

It was initially hoped that the
FHA would provide significant
funding. However, a survey
headed up by Waymer and SGA
Senator John Guthrie produced
results showing Davidson poof

could not. afford FHA help. At
the same time, that survey and

one conductéd by Town In-

spector Potts showed a
significant need.

Twenty-eight families felt
their homes were inadequate.
Eight families of the 55 sur-
veyed had more than two people
per bedroom. One house had six
per bedroom. Pott’s inspection,
based on the town’s non-housing
code, reported 17 houses
“derelict” (unfit to live in).
Another 26 units were termed
“hastening to ruin.’’ Four of the
“derelict” homes are inhabited.

The much hoped for help
from the Community Develop-
ment Act was not forthcoming .
A CDA expert explained that
the Act provides for im-
provement, but not new
development. Although to many
observers the idea of im-
provement seems a significant
step forward, the town of David-
son has neither applied for fun-
ds nor pledged to do so. Other
communities in the area have
made preliminary aplications.

The application procedure is
simple and inexpensive and the
deadline is March 1, 1975. While
no sentiment favoring ap-
plication was forthcoming at
the Monday council meeting,
contrary sentiment was ex-
pressed by Councilman Burl
Narramore. ‘Since we
primarily need public housing
and because the Community
Development Act won ’t provide
that, we shouldn’t aply for
public housing.”

A request from a private
developer to build private
housing was also dismissed as
too expensive to ‘solve the

problem.
At is at this point that the
situation now rests.

Rush Otey continues to seek
relocation for those in the wrost
situations. Charles Ratliff’s
town committee continues to
suggest immediate positive ac-
tionin acquiring whatever FHA
and CDA money is available.
to wait.

Guthrie claims to have lost
faith that they truly desire low
rent housing to the extent that
necessary measures be taken.
No council member has stepped
forward to lead, as Nancy Mac-
Cormac did in the seetting up of
the community center._

As Otey points out, ‘‘much is
being done.’’ As he also
recognized, leadership from the
political arena is sorely lacking.
Low rent housing cannot be a
reality without this leadership.

e money is available now.
Alternate plans to build public
housing can be developed.

As the state community af-
fairs official explained at the
town council meeting, “Public
housing in North Carolina has
worked. . . I realize that you
have an obvious need here. My
concern is in whether you have
a plan to meet that need.” .

unemploymeui was running at
25 percent. Today it is around 6
percent.

“That the alarm bells are
ringing is a sign of the strength
of our society, that we are
determined to take steps to
avoid a major depression.

“Yes, we are going through a
bumpy period, but it is only
minor compared to what we
have been through. It is
amazing that we ever survived
the thirties’ depression.”’

Before looking into his crystal
ball he noted, “I am always
surprised by the future but
never overwhelmed by it. I
think-understanding the future
is almost as hopeless as
predicting the past.”

Boulding projected that the
American economy will grow at
a much slower pace in the next
30 years than it did during the
past 30 years. (Real GNP has
doubled in the past 30 years. )

He also stated that he would
not be surprised if the general
price level 30 years hence were
8 times its present level. We
may live to see the kilo dollar,
even the mega dollar.

“The best way to combat
inflation is to love it,” he said.

Boulding traced present
economic difficulties to energy
shortages, excessive military
spending, particularly in
Vietnam, a non-progressive tax
structure, and the plain fact
that the science of economics is
not sufficiently advanced to
help us correct the economic
problems of today.

Boulding suggested that a
‘program to control the prices of
25 basic wholesale commodities
might have some potential for
slowing inflation.

This could be accomplished
by the government’s stockpiling
of such commodities when they
are in abundance, and selling

them when their natural supply .

gets tight.

This would permit some:
slowing down of the general
price rise while at the same
time permitting prices to do
what they are supposed to do,
i.e., change, so as to reflect
conditions of demand and

supply.

Boulding - also cautioned
against the extinction of the
American farmer, the “‘exalted
peasant of Iowa.’’ Only four
percent of the working force is
employed directly in
agriculture, compared to 40
percent at the turn of the
century.

“Much of our economic
prosperity,. particularly the
doubling of real per capita
income during the last 30 years,
can be traced to innovations in
American agriculture,’ said
Boulding. Such innovations
freed laborers to go out and
produce the goodies: toys,
candy, yoyos, and_ thhe
automobile.

On the forces of change in
society, Boulding said, ‘‘The
most fundamental process in
history is not the dialectical,
i.e., where you have us fighting
them, but rather’ the
evolutionary, biological growth
process, which is seen in the
interaction of populations of
different species, such as the
interacting of animals and
plants in a pond.

“The mammoth problems
confronting the world today--
overpopulaion, hunger,
pollution, threat of nuclear war}
and others--can be solved only’
through cooperation.”

Boulding anticipated that a
series of catastrophes will
shake the world in the next 50
years, but would not destroy our
civilization, which he praised
for its inherent stability and
vitality. (

‘“‘We may be at the end of a
golden age in history. What we
may need to do now is figure
ways to learn what we can from
the catastrophes that will
probably be occurring in the
world, so that we can go
forward more _ strongly
afterwards.”

A recurring theme
throughout his visit was that the
social sciences do. not know
enough about man and human
behavior to predict the future
with much certainty.

“The continuing challenge is
to reduce the uncertainty
through science, and _ to
overcome uncertainty and live
with it through faith.’’

land availability survey, and a
door-to-door survey, it seems
that the housing situation will
be approached from several
sides:

Temporary relocation of per-
sons now in housing that has
been condemned (with the con-
sent of the persons, of course),

Construction of some rental
units for persons able to qualify
for Farmer’s Home _ Ad-
ministration funds (minimum
rent would be in excess of $110
monthly),

Construction on available
land of additional single family
dwellings for those persons able
to qualify for low-interest loans
through the Farmer’s Home
Administration.

The greatest need in David-
son is for rental housing at sub-
stantially lower monthly fees
than the Farmer’s Home
program aliows--thus, con-
siderable efforts still must be
made toward public housing, to
be {nded either locally or
through feacral programs
which stand a good cnance of
being reinstated under the new

Congress.

Additionally, there are funds
available from the Community
Development Act which, if
allotted to Davidson, could go a
long way in improving building
sites, in establishing parks and
other community facilities, and
in generally bettering the en-
vironmental aspects of the
town.

These funds must be
requested by the Town Board
before February 28, and presen-
tly there is no rough draft for an
application, much less a com-
pleted one.

It has become evident since
the publication of the Wilensky-
Stahmann article in The David-
sonian that the great inéquities
in housing were not, being ad-
dressed in any ongoing manner
by either town, college, or
church groups.

The community owes a great
deal to those students wiis have
written, attended meetings.
walked from house to house,
and in so doing, have kept
audible the cry for justice.
