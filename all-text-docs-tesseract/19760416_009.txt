Robert Nicholson

Icarus
Too young he learned to fly Cannot touch him, hold him.
And soaring near the sun You cannot love away the pain,
He singed his wings. Now, at night, But only wait and watch unti}

He dreams, awakes, screaming
With the pain that burns and burns.
He will not be consoled. You

It fades and he returns once more
To sleep.

Anthony Abbott
