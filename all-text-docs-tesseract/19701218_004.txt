SGA Investigates Governance

By JEFF ALLENDER
Copy. Editor

With the: intent of pursu-
ing answers to the problems
of Davidson's “hierarchy”
form of campus govern-
ment, the Governance Com-
mittee of the Student Gov-
ernment ‘Association (SGA),
under junior Danny Clodfelt-
er, are working on sugges-
tions for improved joint fa-
culty-student government.

During the last summer
SGA President Ran Coble
studied various forms of
campus governance systems.
“It is my firm conviction
that the campus can be gov-
erned better than it is with
the hierarchy system,’’ said
Coble. :

He cited one of the pro-
blems currently’ ‘causing
confusion as ‘‘when finaliz-
ed proposals go to the trust-
ees, half the time is spent
telling them what is going
on in the college, rather
than working ‘on finding the
merits of the proposals.

At the other end of the
scale from the trustees, ac-

cording to Coble, is the stu-
dent level of the hierarchy:
“Right now we're at the
lowest end of the scale.’’

‘Another problem inherent
in the current defined levels
of governance he added, is
that the faculty is ‘‘spending
so much time on committee
work — there are 37 facul-
ty committees — that they
don’t have time for their
real job.”’

“For these factors, a col-
lege council is the best form
of government for this - in-
stitution,”’ , concluded Coble.
A college council from gives
governmental authority to a
council composed~ of — stu-
dents, faculty, administra-
tors, and other involved per-
sons,

Coble gave Clodfelter and ,

the. rest of the Governance
‘Committee the task of ex:
amining the governance pro-
cedures of the campus, and
hopefully coming up with a
governance proposal, or at
least a way to improve the
current system.

AED Hosts Duke

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Staff Writer

About 90 (avidson  stu-
dents attended a_ recent
meeting for those who felt
they might be getting a
“raw deal’ from the medi-
cal school application pro-
cess:

The meeting, sponsored by
Alpha Epsilon Delta, featur-
ed Dr. Suydam Osterhout,
Director of Admissions to the
Duke University Medical
School.

(Dr. Osterhout said that the
selection process’ used ‘by

eC

most medical schools is very
similar. Most schools are
trying to find.out whe will
be a good doctor and who
can. survive through four
years of medical school.
(Duke’s Admissions
mittee consists of 17 mem-
bers, including two ‘students.
Initial decisions are made
on a troika basis — by three
members of the committee,
one from the basic science
section, one from the clini-
cal division, and the admis-
sions director. Final deci-
sions are by the committee

New Deferment Policy

According to new régula-
tions issued by Selective
Service Director Curtis W.
Tarr, a young man with a
student deferment who has
a_draft number higher than

‘ 195 can drop his student de-
ferment by December 31 and
sink to a lower priority draft
group’on Januaty 1, 1971.

According. to previous
draft rules, an application
for reclassification had to be
in the hands of local draft
borad personnel before a De-
cember draft board meeting
or it could not be consider-
ed. Now, however, an ap-
plication for reclassification
need only be postmarked no
later than December 31,
1970. :

Tarr, noting that various
draft “boards around the
country were scheduling
their last meetings at vari-
ous times .during the year,
said that the revision was
necessary to’ give all regist-
rants an equal amount of
time to take advantage of
reclassification.

High school and college
deferments, occupational de-
ferments, agricultural defer-
ments, paternity ‘deferments,
and hardship  deferments

,the registrant

may ail be dropped under
the new policy. The 1-Y clas-
sifi¢ation, unacceptable for
military service except dur-
ing national emergency, is
not affected.

Tarr added that all defer-
ments are issued for limited
periods, usually one year,
and automatically lapse if
not renewed, in which case
immediately
becomes 114A.

A deferred ‘student who
has a number higher than
195, the maximum number

_any draft board my reach,

is unlikely to be drafted if
he gives up his student: de-
ferment during this year.

If he does not give up his
deferment, then his name
will. go into the list. of 19-
year-olds when his student
deferment finally expires.
Ut is therefore to the advant-
age of such a person to vol-
untarily give up his defer-
ment for a 14A. |

Com-

from four schools with a
college council form of gov-
ernance system, and an arti~
cle against such a system,
setting a target date of the
third week in January for
submitting this proposal.
Clodfelter said that the
college has made a move in
this direction already, citing
student membership on com-
mittees, sepecially the Com-
mittee of 18, ‘‘which has stu-

dents, faculty, administra-
tion, freshmen, fraternity
men, and most groups in-

volved represented.

‘We have to decide on
which decisions should be
made by joint action, which
decisions are solely in the

province-of the faculty, and
which are solely in the pro-
vince, of the students.”’

According to Clodfelter,
the faculty Governance Com-
mittee is exploring along “the

same lines, and “if they
come close to the joint gov-
ernance idea, there may be
a strong case for agreement
and cooperation in causing
a needed change.”

were a lot of things working
against the freshmen accept-

at large.

‘Dr. Osterhout advised that
applications be submitted as
early in the year as pos-
sible since most medical
schools use a rolling admis-
sions system.

At Duke, ‘‘non-competi-
tive’’ applicants are reject-
ed fairly soon. ‘Marginal’
candidates are put in a hold
file for more _ information,
ysuch as first semester
grades or an MCAT (Medi-
cal College Admissions
Test) retest score. ‘‘Com-
petitive’ students are invit-
ed for an interview.

Dr. Osterhout said that
any Davidson College  stu-
dent is considered ‘‘competi-
tive.”

Selection factors for: me-
dical school include overall
academic’ achievement
(grades), academic achieve-

- ment in the Sciences, signs

of academic improvement,
the college attended by the
student (Davidson
high), and extra-curricular
activities.

Other factors used in the
selection of medical school
students are the (Medical
College Admissions Test,

’ Letters of Recommendation

(considered very important),
the ability to communicate
(shown in the _ interview),
knowledge of what the stu-
dent is getting into, and mo-
tivation. :

‘One of the major problems
faced. by applicants to medi-
cal schools is the tremend-
ous cost of attendance. Tui-
tion. at Duke is: approaching
$2,000%a year, and the ‘aver-
age estimated cost is about’
$4,800 a year.

with the college paying the
social fees, this was an in-
centive not to pledge.

‘And thirdly many came
to this«eollege with the idea
that they were not going to
pledge a fraternity. De-
spite these disadvantages, 40
per cent of the class -pledg-
ed fraternities,”".he said,

“T have -hopes: that the
trustees can be persuaded
that -eight to four ratio of
eating clubs to fraternities
would be a healthier situa-
tion than the present one.
It would supply a greater
choice for the students at

lieve .that most freshmen
would agree to this combin-

Ralston said that he did
not feel that fraternities em-
phasize exclusion. ‘‘The
college has portrayed fra-
ternity members as enjoying
the act of excluding some-
one,’ he said. ‘‘I don’t think
this is the case, especially
at ithis school.

“I am afraid that people
will be hurt under the new
system. The proposal of the
Committee of Eighteen did
not ‘turn out as well as I'd
hoped it would,’’ he said.

MONDAY - SATURDAY

(Mrs. Spencer returned
about two weeks ago, and
she is expecting her husband
to arrive late this evening
after eight weeks abroad
observing foreign study pro-
grams.

president completed his last
week of_interviews at Heidel-
berg, Freiburg, and Con-
stance University. ‘‘All of

the trip was in Germany ex-
cept for two short visits to

When asked for her fa-

-vorite .impression while in

Europe she at first found it
difficult to select any parti-
cular site. ‘‘I think probably
the visit to Berlin was. the
reat highlight of the trip just
because of the situation of
the divided city to ‘begin
with. The free university at
West Berlin is as dramatic

and controversial as any
place in Germany.
(Mrs, Spencer. explained

that the purpose of the trip
was to give a perspective for
evaluating Davidson's for-
eign study program. ‘‘One
part of this visit was to
gather information about
American programs at for-
eign universities, and Presi-
dent Spencer met a Jot of
proféssors in these.”

The Spencers had ad op-

portunity to observe local
politics in two German
states. Mrs. Spencer said,

“It was very interesting to
view elections in-Hessen and
Bavaria because school re-
form was involved in party
alignment.

“The DAAD (German
Academic Exchange Service)
had suggested to President
Spencer that he might be in-
terested. in the way school
reform influenced the elect-
ions."’ *
