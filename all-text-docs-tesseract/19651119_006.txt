intellectual growth.

In concluding that neither fac-
ulty nor curriculum brought out
the talents of the ‘‘few really
outstanding young men in its
student body’, the committee
cited several departments, par-
ticularly with respect to the
number of men they sent to
graduate schools.

‘ The Chemistry Department
was praised both for their work
in sending a number of men into
distinguished graduate work and
for the ‘aggressive enthusiasm”
of its members. The Physics
Department was said to be doing
an adequate but average job.

At the same time the Biology
Department was hit for not man-
aging to average even one man
per year into graduate study.

The work of juniors and sen-

upperclassmen themselves were
cited as having an excessive in-
terest in soclal activities. In-
creased emphasis on seminar
and independent tresearch pro-
grams were urged as solutions
to this problem.

The committee report stated
that the genera) quality of stu-
‘dents entering Davidson was
i slowly improving but that there
'were still serious problems in
prospective majors.

The committee asked whether
‘there were too many pre-meds
being admitted and -wondered
whether it was healthy to have
73 per cent of the senior majors
concentrated in four depart-
‘ments (pre-med, economics and

demic structure and to prepare
better the number of men go-
ing to graduate school, the com-
: mittee made many suggestions,
| several of them of immediate
interest.

A test in English composition
;to be administered during the
. second semester of the sopho-

more year was recommended
for graduation, along with rem-
edial English courses to be
taken without credit for students
| tailing the test.

Also for graduation, each stu-
dent should be required to make
a certain score on the Graduate
Record examination of his major
or its equivalent—this program
to be instituted’ immediately.
Comprehensive examinations
administered by persons from
outside the college were strong-
ly endorsed. Such changes would
revolutionize Davidson’s present
graduation requirements.

ROTC

Compulsory ROTC would be
dropped under the new program.

Birch Society Member

By T. CARTER FUSSELL
Davidsonian Staff Writer

John H. Rousselot, National
Director of Public Relations for
the John Birch Society, will
speak in chapel Dec. 1 on “The
jJohn Birch Society, Its Prin-
ciples and programs.”

Rousselot, a native Califor-
nian, holds a BA jin political
science and business administra-
tion from Principia College,
Elsah, Ml.

He has been a vigorous op-
ponent of communism and s0-
cialism and a strong advocate of
uncompromising adherence to
the basic principles of limited
government and individual free-
dom.

Strategy Expert Looks
At Warfare Problems

By AL VARNER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The Davidson Audience re-
ceived a new twist in its regular
diet of chapel speakers Tues-
day.

What was a little different in
this instance was that Dr. Paul
W. Blackstock, PhD from Amer-
ican University and associate
professor of international studies
at the University of South Caro-
lina, had organized his interest-
ing generalities and actually
stuck to his three-point outline.
This outline ‘was a chronological
one which dealt with his topic.
military strategy.

The first point of the outline
dealt with historical and tradi-
tional military strategy. In the
past, according to Dr. Black-
stock, the world system has
been based on tangible power.
Countries didn’t have permanent

Scarce.”

friends, only permanent inter-
ests in ways to gain power.
Strong countries were balanced
by coalitions of weak nations,
as evidenced in the two world
wars.

Blackstock stated: ‘Power,
like wealth. is scarce,’’ and
“every nation has a dynamic
force which propels it to seek
power.”” This dynamic force is
based on 1) maintaining the
country’s autonomy and free-
dom, 2) building a strong econ-
omy and 3) gaining power for
the sake of power.

But the most important con-
cept of traditional military strat-
egy was that war was consider-
ed an integral part of deter-
rence. Armed forces were used
not only to deter, but possibly
to defeat the enemy by inflict-
ing ‘unacceptable damage.” In
World War II, this unacceptable
damage consisted of killing only

issues outside of the special

“His concern over the danger

erable attention.”

_ In the House of Representa-
tives, Rousselot served on the
Post Office and Civil Service
Committee and the Banking and
Currency Committee. In addi-
tion, he was secretary of the
California Republican Congres-
sional Delegation.

Hhe has also been director of
public information for the Fed-
eral Housing Administration and
deputy to the chairman of the
California State Board of Equal-
ization.

Rousselot served as Western
District Governor for the John
Birch Society. Since July, 1964,
he has been National Director of
Public Relations for the John
Birch Society and publisher of
American Opinion Magazine.

His professional background
includes president of his own
public relations firm, director of
a public relations organization
and a life underwriter for a
Los Angeles insurance company.

He is associated with the First
Church of Christ Scientist, San
Marino: -the National Press
Club, Washington, D. C., the
Junior Chamber of Commerce
and the Kiwanis Club.

Rousselot’s visit is sponsored
with considerable expense by
Open End, whose entire budget
comes from the College Union.

Chapel will not be held on
Monday, Nov. 29, but instead on
the following Wednesday when
Rousselot will speak. A coffee
hour will follow in the Morrison
Room.

The controversial film ‘'Par-
able’ will be shown as part of
the Vespers services Sunday at
7:30 p.m. in Chambers Auditor-
ium.

The film, starring master pan-
tominist Marcel Marceau, is in
color and lasts 22 minutes; its
showing will take the place of
the sermon. |

First showa at the Protestant-
Orthodox Center at the New.
York World's Fair, the film has
since been the center of a con-
siderable amount of controversy.

The script, written by a Budd-
hist, has been attacked for its al-
