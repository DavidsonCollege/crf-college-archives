Dorcas performs surgery on python

By STUART ANN VARNER
Staff Writer

An image of a dead six-foot, par-
tially digested alligator hanging out
of the gullet of a 16-foot Burmese
Python confirmed suspicions of a
changing ecosystem in Florida’s
Everglades National Park.

Last Wednesday night, one of
these threatening pythons arrived
from Florida via a Delta Airlines
commercial flight in a body bag to
the care of Professor of Biology
Michael Dorcas.

Dorcas, skilled in radio teleme-
try, technology in which radio
devices are inserted into the body
cavity of small animals for tracking
purposes, performed surgery on a
15-foot, two-inch 90-pound female
Burmese Python with the help of
biology students.

with the common veterinary anes-
thetic isoflourine, Dorcas implant-
ed two radio transmitters and a
temperature data logger into the
body cavity of the python.

These devices will enable a team
of scientists in the Everglades to
monitor the snake’s behavior in its
natural environment.

“Radio telemetry is usually used
to protect animals from extinction,
but in the case of the Burmese
python, we are using it to extermi-
nate them,” Dorcas said.

By learning where the pythons
go, when they are active, and what
they eat, an educated eradication
plan can be put into practice.

This past December, Dorcas and
Davidson biology major Shannon
Pittman ’08 traveled to the
Everglades to perform the same

surgery on four captured Burmese .

Pythons.

Burmese pythons, native to
Southeast Asia and capable of
growing up to 20 feet in length, are
popular in the uncontrolled pet
trade.

However, when they grow to
about 12 feet in length, owners
cannot easily take care of them and
opt to release them into the

Burmese. Pythons thrive in. the

warm, wet environment, laying up _

to 50 eggs at once. Each egg hatch-
es a two-foot python that can live
to be 30 years old.

This high reproductive rate has
made the Burmese Python a real
threat to indigenous endangered
birds, mammals and reptiles.

Until the data is collected, it is
difficult to determine the extent of
the python’s threat on such ani-

RLO to renovate Duke

By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

Duke Residence Hall renova-
tions and the construction of on-
campus town homes located on the
comer of Ridge Road and Main
Street will begin this spring.

Duke is expected to re-open in
the fall of 2007 while the town
homes will be finished by next fall.

Though the renovation of Duke
and the construction of on-campus
town homes will alleviate housing
shortages in the future, students
should expect to see serious

changes in housing distribution in
the upcoming lottery.

Residence living is moving far-
ther away from academic buildings
in the form of several small units of
housing rather than a few large

units.

The town homes will be a tem-
porary housing option for one year.
Once Duke re-opens, they will be
refurbished and sold to faculty and
staff interested in affordable hous-
ing options in the Davidson area.

Some students are concerned
about the separation of dorms dur-
ing the upcoming academic year.

“While this extra housing sounds
great for people who are trying to
cluster but can’t all live in F, I must
admit I hope it doesn’t take away
from the senior apartments,”
Lindsay deCastrique ’07 said. “My
friends and I have been excited
about living with the majority of
our class next year.”

Lottery Phase II on March 22

Kristol delivers Wearn lecture

By SUMMERLEE WALTER |
Senior Staff Writer

Conservative writer and political
analyst William Kristol delivered
the 2006 Joseph Wearn Lecture on
“Development of American
Foreign Policy in the Post 9-11
Era” last night in the Duke Family
Performance Hall.

Kristol focused on placing the
current political situation into an
historical context, arguing that the
aftermath of the World Trade
Center attacks is comparable to the
fundamentally new era that arrived
after World War II with the subse-
quent rise of Communism.

To illustrate his point concerning
the recent paradigm shift in

American political _ attitudes,
Kristol compared the 2000 presi-
dential election, during which the
attack on the U.S.S. Cole barely
provoked a reaction from either
candidate, to the 2004 election.

In 2004, American foreign poli-
cy and the United States’ stance on
terrorism proved to be the major
point of contention.

“Kristol did a pretty good job of
putting the current problems into
an historical perspective,” said
Joseph Adams ’06. “President
Bush and others haven’t done a
great job of this, but it is so impor-

tant.”

Kristol cited the debates over
foreign policy, the United States’
role in world politics, the proper

role of the judiciary and questions
of Constitutional law.

He argued that the political situ-
ation is a fluid one that provides no
obvious clues concerning what will
happen next.

Kristol also stressed the impor-
tance of the current political situa-
tion for the Republican Party, argu-
ing that it tests them because they
control both the Presidency and
Congress.

“The good news is, Republicans
finally have the chance to govern;
the bad news is, it’s hard to gov-
ern,” Kristol said.

Kristol also discussed the
uniqueness of the situation sur-
