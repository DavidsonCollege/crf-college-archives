HUMANIZING EDUCATION
TREATED BY DR. METCALF

Dr. J. C. Metcalf of the University of
Virginia English department brought his
speaking engagement to a close Tuesday
morning at the assembly hour in a
strong address, “Humanizing Education.”
As in all of his talks and addresses be-
fore the students of the college and the
citizens of the town, Dr. Metcalf pleased
his hearers not more with the solid
thought of his discourse than with the
beautiful way in which he gave expres-
sion to those thoughts.

In his address the speaker urged the
need of less stress of the material and
more of the ideal, the cultural, the beau-
tiful, in our training for the work of life.
He called to mind Huxley's definition of
education, “the ability that makes a man
able to do the thing that he ought to do,
whether he feels like doing it or. not.”
Education is thus a personal and in-
dividual matter on one hand and on the
other is of real importance to the nation,
made up as the nation is of the mass of
individuals.

While we have in late years gotten
away from the alleged evil in the ed-
ucation of other days, that it made a few
men great and Icft the masses in the
| lowlands, we have probably made as
great a mistake by increasing the gen-
eral education and not building enough
ireally great men. The speaker urged
bettering the standard for all, and also
plead for the cultivation of intellectual
giants in addition. .

Dr. Metcalf stated that one loaf of
bread for the body and a hyacinth to
promote the thought of the beautiful is
better than two loaves of bread to feed
the body. Organization without soul is
not enough. Organization did not give
Germany all she needed, though that or-
ganization was probably the most com-
plete any nation has ever known. Her
soul was not built up and she fell.

With the thought, “Earth changes but
the soul and God do not,” the speaker
closed his address and added another to
ithe list of intellectual pleasures he af-
forded his many Davidson admirers.

R. 0. T. C. BAND TO SPEND
THANKSGIVING AT
FLORA MACDONALD COLLEGE

The band has been very much elated
for quite awhile, about their Thanks-
‘giving trip. When asked where he was
going to eat his Thanksgiving dinner,
|foingsworth, the drummer boy, with
his face beaming, replied, “In the hall of
_Flora Macdonald College, Red Springs,
N.C.” Yes, this is the treat awaiting
the Davidson wildcat band on November
the twenty-fifth.

It is the intention of Capt. Freeman to
board his crew on the eleven-fifty
Wednesday morning and spend a few
j hours in Charlotte. They will leave at
five o’clock for Monroe, N. C., where the
j first concert is to be given. Next a, con-
cert will be given Thursday night at F.
M. C. After the concert—oh well, we
can't say here—!

It is rumored that the boys have to be
censored by the Faculty of the said col-
lege before’ they ate allowed to have
even a pleasant chat with the fair ones,
but we trust that such a handsome bunch
'as those in the Davidson band will have
{ne trouble from such quarters.

This trip will be the first one taken to
Red Springs by the band, and they are

’
’

Thursday night and we have no doubt of
it. Go to it Wildcats!

HANDSOME BOYS PRE-
PARE FOR CHRISTMAS

“These are fine,” “I don’t like any of
these,” “Tell me which one you like
best.” These are only a few of the
many remarks heard in Shearer Hall
last Thursday afternoon. The cause of
all this was the arrival and display of
proofs of the pictures for the annual.
Many were horrified when they gazed
upon themselves as others see them.
While some few blushingly acknowl-
edged that the pictures were almost as
good looking as the subjects themselves.
It is rumored that a certain young mem-
ber of the Macamac Company was so
well pleased that he ordered a whole
dozen finished in the “billboard” size,
saying that his ambition was to put one
in every home.

But just a little secret on the side. The
‘reason most of the fellows decided on
the spur of the moment to have some
pictures finished was in order to get an
opportunity to talk to the extremely
pleasing young lady, representing

companied the proofs—since they were
so good looking!

MADAME JO-JO, THE MEDIUM.

The ouija board has become the arbiter
of the world’s destiny! The gay and
festive spirits take delight in tipping
tables, sending messages through ani-
mated pencils, and telling the latest
scandal of the other world by means of
gifted mediums.

The greatest medium of them all is
Madam Jo-jo, the dusty beauty, whose
revelations have proven the sensation
of the spiritualistic world. She has the
enthusiastic endorsement of Sir Oliver
Lodge, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mr.
Charles Vance, and other eminent ex-
ponents of spiritualism. She gained un-
dying fame by predicting at 12 o’clock on
November 2, that Harding would very
probably be elected president. Also dur-
ing the third quarter of the game on
November 7, she gave her opinion dur-
ing a trance that Davidson would prob-
ably beat South Carolina. Marvelous!

Madame Jo-jo is coming to Davidson!
She will be one of the headliners in the
Minstret Show to be présented here on
November 27. Don't fail to see her.
