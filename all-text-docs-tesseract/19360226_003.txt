Speaker Calls on Students To
Begin Practicing Their
Religion Now

HEARING ALSO NEEDED’

Students Know the Right But
Lack Power To Do It

Dr. BR, Lacy, Jr, president
of the Union Theological Sem-
inary in Richmond, addressed
the Davidson student body at
the Vesper Sunday,
February 23.

Dr. Lacy chose a text of the na-

ture that he imagined he would
like to have heard when—he was
a student at Davidson. This text

was James 1:22, “Be ye doers of
the Word hearers
deceiving yourselves.”

Dr. Lacy stated that we must not
only be a hearer of the word, but

James “he must hear

as says,
If one does not have
these gifts of knowledge and ability

to hear prayerfully he must go to

God and ask Him for these fac-
ulties.
Dr. Lacy stated that a person

should hear the Word of God with
his heart fixed against sin and in-
tellectual pride. A humility of pride
and heart are necessary to be able
to hear the Word.

When a person becomes a stu-
dent the Word, he must then
become a “doer.” Most boys come
to an inherited faith.
When they become students of the
Word, doubt as to the truthfulness
of religion arises ins their minds.
These then put off their
doings until they find the answers
to their questions. This putting off
of religion keeps on until the stu-
dent gets out of the habit of prac-
ticing any religion,

position

Last Saturday night Law-
rence Tibbet, world - famous
baritone, thrilled a jammed

audience at the Elizabeth
School auditorium.
Tibbet, who was brought to

Charlotte by the Community Con-

cert Association, started the pro-
gram by singing “Hear Me Ye
Winds and. Waves,” by Handel,

“The Cloths of Heaven” by Thom-
as Dunhill, and “I Am a Roamer
Bold,” by Mendelssohn. i

The second part of his concert

consisted of four popular songs:
“The Wanderer” by Schubert;
“Love Song,” by Brahms; “Fare

Thee Well” by Wolf, and The Om-
by Schubert: After a
brief interlude of two piano solos,
Tibbet concluded the first division
of his concert with the aria “Nem-

nipotence”

ico della Patria’ from “Andrea
Chenier” by Giordano,

Following a brief intermission,
the famous star of operatic and
concert. stage chose his next group
of songs from some of the more
recent composers. Opening with

“The Dream” by Edward Horsman,
he continued by rendering “The
Bagpipe Man” by Howard McKin-

ney and “The Through Freight”
by Keith Brown. For his closing
selections Tibbet sang Moussorg-

sky’s unique song, “Death’s Lulla-
by,” and “Come Buy,” some lines
of.Shakespeare set to music very
effectively by Arturo Buzzi-Peccia.

Music lovers will long remember
Mr. Tibbet’s concert in the crowd-
ed auditorium of Elizabeth School.
About fifty students and towns-
people of Davidson attended the
concert.

Davidson’s Mail Arrives By
Telephone, Telegraph,
And Post Office

Davidson’s connection with
civilization is a thin and wide-
ly used thread of communica-
tion, consisting of the mail, the
telegraph, and the telephone,

The largest assortment of mail,
about 37420 of the total, is brought

over from Charlotte by truck at
4:30 in the morning. This allot-
ment is a transfer of the north and
south bound mail which has ae-
cumulated at Charlotte. Of the six
passenger trains that stop at our
outpost, the three trains from
Greensboro, No. 1 at 10:52 A. M.,
No. 22 at 1:51 P. M., and No, 21 at

3:35 P.M. leave about 45% of our

letters, The remaining percentage
of mail is carried by No, 12 from
Charlotte and No, 15 from Taylors-
ville, which arrive at 1:25 P. M.
hand 7:23 P. M, respectively. The
majority of the parcel post comes
in at 9:18 from Charlotte. Mr.
Stough, postmaster, said that there
has beenvabout a 6% gain in mail
of last year over the year before.
Amazing as it may seem, an ay-
erage of about fifty telegrams come

into Davidson every day, while
about twenty-five are sent out,
Probably more than 60° of these

telegrams come to, and are sent by,
the students. Before the dances the
