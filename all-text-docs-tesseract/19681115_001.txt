Committee Hears
New Exam Plan

A proposal for self-sched-
uled exams was presented to
the faculty's Educational
Policy Committee Wednes-
day, then tabled for further
discussion at the next meet-
ing.

No action was taken on the
proposal, according to Dean

Registration for students
who want no course changes
is already complete, said
Registar J. H. Ostwalt this
week, but changes in courses
will be possible today, next

Seniors may change cour-
ses today and Monday: jun-
iors, Tuesday and Wednes-
day: sophomores, Thursday
and Friday: and freshmen,
Monday and Tuesday, Nov.
25 and 26.

Ostwalt said that course
changes made after the de-
signated days would cost a
student $2 to “add or drop a
course.

Academic waivers for the
winter term would be grant-
ed only in emergency cases,
said Ostwalt, but those for
the spring term could be re-
quested after Jan. 20.

man. “We discussed the
exams, and we will continue
talking about them at the
next meeting.”

The plan was introduced
by the student representa-
tive on the committee, John
Williams, and was based on
similar plans in effect at
Haverford College and Mary
Baldwin College.

Williams said it would be
necessary to take a sampling
of opinion among the student
body to determine their at.
titude to the proposal.

If put in effect, the plan
would require that each stu-
dent indicate on a special
card several weeks before
exams begin at what times
he would prefer to take his
exams. The student would
receive another card back
later telling what time his
exam is scheduled.

Although there is no assur-
ance that a student will get
the time he wants, the plan
will insure that more stu-
dents will get favorable
schedules, Williams said.

The plan would raise a few
problems, among them that
professors would not be pres.
ent to answer questions dur-
ing the exams. It would also
place an extra burden on
the honor system because
students would be taking the
same exam at different
times.

Hobbie Questions
Open Door Policy

By JOHN McLEAN
Staff Writer

The prospect for more
open dorms in the near fu-
ture appeared rather gloomy
this week after Dean of Stu-
dents Richard C. Burts Jr.
revealed that there is some
disagreement between the
Residence Hall Council and
the dean's office.

The controversy in part
revolves around which of two
sets of rules will govern fu-
ture open dorms.

“I have no intention of pro-
ceeding with any open house
until the situation is clari-
fied,"’ said Burts. ;

The two previous open
dorms, in the spring of last
year and the one last week
end. were termed ‘‘experi-
mental'’ by Burts. They
were held ‘“‘partly to show
students that a new spirit
was moving,” he said.

Peter Hobbie, SGA vice
president and head of the
RHA, voiced concern that
so much emphasis was being
placed on: the rules for open
house, rather than the re.
sponsibility of the students
involved. He said that “all
this fuss over rules" defied
the spirit of the Code of Re-
sponsibility.

Hobbie said that the Resi-
dence Halt Association
should be a vehicle by which
dorms can become a social
organization in campus life.
But the administration, he
said, ‘‘sees it as a policing
force."

Hobbie admitted that
dorms should assume a cor-
porate type of responsibility
for damage to dorms during
open house, but that the RHA
should not impose a corpor-
ate direction over dorm resi-
dents’ social life.

“The purpose ef open
dorms is not to pack the
dorms with women," he said.
“And I would call it a suc-
cess if it adds something to
the social life of only five
people.”’

At any rate, said Hobbie,
“the RHC isn't going to be
just an enforcement agency.”

Late studies and virtually
all other constructive activi-
ties were squelched by the
freak snow-thunderstorm
which all but crippled the
Davidson campus and parts
of Charlotte Tuesday. The
storm caused huge limbs to
break off many of the trees
in the area and electricity
was cut off when falling
limbs shorted out power
lines.

The __ two-and-a-half-inch
snow was the earliest mea-
surable show on record at
Douglas Airport in Charlotte.
The earliest previous record-

One of the rules which the
administration favors is that
doors to be left ‘‘wide open"
during open house. Hobbie
asked whether this ‘meant

that all doors had to be left -

open, or just those of rooms
where women were visiting.
“What do they want us to
do?’ he said. ‘‘Knock on the
the closed doors and ask
‘Are you studying or making
out?’ *'

Hobbie expressed the hope
that rules would not have to
be included which super.
ceded the individual's own
responsibility for his behav-
ior, because this, he said’
would ‘‘kill the spirit of the
code.’'

FIVE-YEAR PROPOSALS

ANNOUNCED

(See Page Four)

NUMBER EIGHT

Lack Of Diversity Noted

By GEORGE ALLEN
News Editor
President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. wanted ‘‘diversity."
In instructing the Student
Government Association Sen.
ate to appoint student mem.
bers to his five commissions,
Spencer emphasized that he
wanted ‘‘diversity’’ in those
students selected. He did not
specify what sort of diversity

he wanted.

If one assumes that Spen-
cer wanted diversity of opin
ion, approach and philoso
phy. in some cases he got
what he wanted: in most
eases. he did not.

Although it-is too early to
be pessimistic about the
workings of the commissions,
it. is not. premature to dis
cuss the opinions of the stu.
dents involved in them.

A recent survey of the
Spencer commissions was
taken by THE DAVIDSON.
IAN and revealed that. most
of these students had similar
ideas on what their particu.
lar commission should. ac
complish.

All three of the students
involved in the Commission
on Coeducation, Pat Bray,
Mac Davis and Joe Murphy,
are strongly in favor of co
education at Davidson.

All agreed that their com-
mission would face the same
problems: whether to build
an alternate women's cam-
pus here, to admit women
to the present campus or to
affiliate Davidson with an es-
tablished women’s college,
and how to finance the pro
cess of going coeducational.

Not one of these students
had considered having Da-
vidson remain a men’s col-
lege. all insisting that Da-
vidson must become a Co.
educational institution if it
is to continue to attract the
better students.

Peter Hobbie, Bayard

Miller and Al Varner are
also essentially in agree-
ment as to the approach
they plan to take toward the
the Commission on Social
Patterns. All felt that the
goal of their commission is
to devise a system which
will offer every student at
Davidson equal opportunities
for social life.

Each emphasized the need
for a re-evaluation of the
fraternity system, suggest
ing that the selective nature
of the fraternity system

could never encompass the
entire student body.

The Commission on Extra-
Campus Responsibilities.

James Parks and Larry
Slade, seems to be a little

CLIMBING THE WALLS

Rumors have it the new curriculum is tough,
but Fourth Floor Cannon seems to be tak-

actually a term paper project for the new

Five-Year Plan Committee Shows

Methods To Assist Disadvantaged

A group of students have
written a proposal for ad-
mitting a large number of
disadvantaged students to
Davidson and allowing them
to take five years to grad-
uate.

The Five-Year Plan Com-
mittee released its prelimin

ary report this week and will
present it to the Commission
on Extra-Campus Responsi-
bilities, said George Rabin-
son, a member of the group.

The proposal has two pur-
poses, Robinson said. It is
designed to benefit society

by educating members of

ales 5 7

low-income and minority
groups who have previously
been. denied opportunities

for higher education, and it:

will improve the total edu
cational experiencé at Da-
vidson by providing a more
diverse student body.

ABOUT THAT CODE OF RESPONSIBILITY ...
Does Someone up there disagree?

Snow Storm Squelches Studies;
Early Flakes Knock Out Power

able snow fell on Nov. 14,
1906.

The early arrival of the
snow was partly the cause
for the numerous broken
limbs around the campus,
according to Physica) Plant
Director Grover Meetze.
Many campus trees still had
their leaves, he said, and
thus a greater than normal
amount of snow accumulat-
ed on the branches, weigh-
ing them down to the break-
ing point.

Meetze also pointed to the
high density of the snow as
a factor in the breakage of
branches. The wetness of the

snow made it much heavier
than the powdery snow nor-
mal for this area.

Although Meetze declined
to estimate the damage to
the trees, he said the costs
for trimming the trees would
probably be a few thousand
dollars. Falling limbs also
tore down almost all of the
power lines to the campus
lighting system.

Meetze said, however, that
there were no on-campus
failures of the primary elec-
trical systems. The three-
and-a-half-hour blackout
Monday night was caused by
shorts on three power lines

leading into the campus on
Concord Avenue, Depot
Street and North Main
Street.

These short circuits were
caused by limbs falling on
the wires. According to
Meetze many of the blue
flashes which accompanied
the storm were caused by
electrical arcs as the lines
shorted out.

Meetze and his crews work-
ed from 9 p.m.. until the
early morning to minimize
damage and to restore power
to the campus. Power ser-
vice was restored about 2:42
a.m,

search of the committee into
areas including selection of
such students, their impact
on the college and on society,
and operation and funding of
the program.

The Five-Year Plan Com.
mittee was organized last
spring by the Student Tutor-
jal Education Program
(STEP) executive commit-
tee to research various

means of attacking the prob-
lem of education of the dis.
advantaged, said Robert
Pyeatt. director of STEP.

The committee conducted
most of its research during
the summer, including cor.
responding with and visiting
a number of institutions
which now operate such pro-
grams, Pyeatt said.

10 Senators Put
On 3 Committees

The SGA Senate appointed
senators to three committees
and heard a favorable re-
port from John Passmore on
the possibility of self-sched-
uled exams at the end of the
trimester at its weekly meet-
ing Tuesday.

In appointing the commit.
tee members, President Joe
Murphy said He hoped the
Senate could begin doing
most of its work in commit-
tees which are set up by the
constitution. The Senate now
meets once a week but plans
to have meetings of the
whole Senate only every
other week once the commit.
tee system is functioning.

Floyd Strand and Steve
Salyer were elected to ‘the
Senate Executive Committee.
The Committee on the Union
and Social Life consists of
Peter Hobbie, Frank Weise,
Cc. L. Cheshire, Jody Turner
and Harlan Day. Rich Cow-
art, Frank Murphy and John
Passmore were appointed to
the Educational Affairs Com-
mittee.

‘Passmore presented a pre.
liminary report from the
Academic Scheduling Com-
mittee which is attempting
to introduce self-scheduled-
exams. Passmore said he
was confident this would be
approved but that nothing
definite would be known un-
til next week.

The ROTC and Chapel

Program Committee failed to
produce reports, so Murphy
instructed them to meet this
week and have a statement
ready by next Tuesday.

Harry Goldman. who ab-
stained on the vote last week
to make the ROTC program
voluntary, then spoke up
rather vehemently against
‘the committee which will
present proposals for im-
implementation of a volun-
tary program.

Second
Convention
Looms

A second constitutional con-
vention ~- but this one over
more controversial issues —
looms as a result of several
requests for changes in the
SGA constitution by the facul-
ty Student Life Committee.

Among the changes are the
creation of a joint student-
faculty court.of appeals, and
the elimination of a clause in
the Bill of Rights guarantee-
ing students their rights ‘as
citizens."

The Senate is expected to
consider proposing a con-
stitutional convention to
consider these and other
changes at its meeting Tues-
day night.
