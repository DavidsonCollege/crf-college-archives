have served as a way for one
woman to show her love for her
community. For 29 years, Jo
Anne Shackelford announced
birthdays, anniversaries, and
other events with messages of

Incoming class selected from
largest applicant pool to date

By KATE GILLESPIE
Senior Staff Writer

The Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid finished reviewing
4,257 applications on March 25 by
accepting 25.8 percent of appli-
cants for admission to Davidson.

After admitting 184 students
from two early decision deadlines,
the Office of Admission mailed
acceptance letters to 915 of the reg-
ular decision applicants.

“We’re very excited about the
class,” Director of Multicultural
Admission Wookie Payne said.
“It’s a very powerful class as far as
leadership experience, academic
accomplishments, and intellectual
curiosity. We try to shape a class
that will provide an exciting educa-
tional experience for all our stu-
dents.”

The total number of applicants
was up 2.4 percent from last year,
and the acceptance rate was lower

than last year’s rate of 26.6 per-
cent.

Payne attributed the difference in
numbers to the Office of
Admission’s commitment to main-
taining classes of approximately
460 students.

“Our approach to this class was
first and foremost not to overenroll
the class,” Payne said. ““We wanted
to admit at a rate that would not
overadmit the class and allow us to
admit students from the waiting
list. We haven’t admitted any stu-
dents on the waiting list over the
last two years.”

The Office of Admission typical-
ly expects 40 to 41 percent of
admitted students to enroll,
although Payne believes that -a
growing applicant pool may be a
sign that more students are interest-
ed in attending Davidson.

The admitted students represent
46 states and 25 countries. The

Alcohol and drug
policy under review

CCRL approves four recommendations
for change, will discuss others April 12

By Liz Barry
News Editor

The Counsel on Campus and
Religious Life (CCRL) approved
four recommendations for changes
to Davidson’s alcohol and illegal
drug policies last month:

Because of time constraints,
CCRL was unable to discuss or
vote on issues pertaining to the dis-
tribution of alcohol to minors,
drinking games, risk management
and party policies and relations
between Campus Police and stu-
dents. .

The. Alcohol and Drug Policy
Review Task Force, chaired by
Dean of Students Leslie
Marsicano, drafted the recommen-
dations after reviewing current
drug and alcohol policies over the
past several months.

The Patterson Court Council has
reviewed the Task Force’s propos-
als and is drafting several addition-

al recommendations. President
Bobby Vagt will make a final deci-
sion regarding policy changes after
reviewing the various proposals
later this month.

CCRL approved the recommen-
dation that classified using a false
ID for alcohol service on campus
as an Honor Code violation. “This
issue hasn’t been articulated clear-
ly or publicized widely in the past,”
Marsicano said. ‘‘We affirmed that
our proposed policy is a good
idea.”

The second recommendation
approved by CCRL was a stricter
drug policy that differentiates
between marijuana and harder
drugs. Currently, a first drug
offense of any kind results in a
minimum of probation and drug
education counseling. The Task
Force’s recommendation stipulates
that a first offense of a drug harder
than marijuana should result in
