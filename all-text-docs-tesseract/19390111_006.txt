QUESTION OF THE WEEK,

{Continued from Page Three]

Goerge McDonald, Sophomore: |

Believing sincerely that the ma- |
jority of the Davidson students do |
not derive any exceptional pleasure
from deliberately breaking out win- |
dow panes and doing other damage |
to school property, I consider the!
reestablishment of the damage fee |
unfair. Under the damage fee sys- |
tem, when the administration fails |
to detect the offender, as is proba- |
bly known, it subtracts the cost of |
the damage from the fees paid by
all the students and at the end of |
the year proportions what is left |
back to the students. Thus it would
be practically impossible for any
student, guilty or not, to get back!
the entire sum he deposited. I am |
in favor of letting the |
who do the smashing do the pay-
ing.

“Y” EVENTS

[Continued from Page Three]
goodness, faith, meekness, and
temperance. If we have these, of
couse we will want to share them
with others, and our generosity will
be limited only by our bank-book.

If the students here do not ex-
hibit these qualities, the “Y” has
fallen down on its job. We have
failed to make Christ real to the
students.

Gentlemen, we have failed you.
We have not shown you how Christ
can become real to you. We ask
your forgiveness and your future
cooperation. We cannot do it by
ourselves. You reached the
age where you not only feed your-
| selves, but you operate your own
boarding houses. It should be the
same with that spiritual food which
is so needed for all of us.

Don’t think that you can go
through life having religion fed to
you with a spoon. Have your own
religious experience. That doesn’t
mean you have to go to revivals.
The greatest religious experiences
come when We are on our knees
before God, beseeching him to
lighten our darkness, to give us
wisdom, and to make us want to
do his will.

Christ said, “Him that
cometh unto me I will in no wise
