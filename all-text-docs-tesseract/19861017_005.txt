Alan Alda Ain’t Here in original Mk AxS*H

By MARK CHEN

M*A*S*H the movie is not
nuch like M*A*S*H the TV
series. For one thing, television
>an’t have the real'no-no words or
the brutal facts of sexual life. You
2an depict sex on TV now, but you
can’t begin to suggest the interest-
ing positions or possibilities. For

another, there are the unwritten_

rules of television. A TV series
cannot’ get the ratings unless it
creates a warm, family feeling.
M*A*S*H the TV series followed
all these rules for TV success and
became a hit. Hawkeye Pierce
grew into the lovable Alan Alda,
who is so understanding about ev-
erybody. The army medical unit
became another extended TV
family, sometimes with the occa-
sional Korean orphan. The TV
show became a success, but it did
so by distancing itself from the
original movie.

M*A*S*H the movie is nasty,
spiteful, and cruel. At moments it
is funny, but the laughter comes
through a cruelty practiced on
others. There is no plot to speak
of, only a confused series of vis-

cious jokes. Absurd events. take
place which can only be accepted
by being ignored. The characters
rarely talk to each other in this
movie, for they have little to say.
Each is too busy trying to survive
his or her own individual hell.
There is comedy here, but the
comedy is bleak and unsentimen-
tal. *- 2

Hawkeye Pierce is not a
charming stand-in for Groucho
Marx, but a hard-bitten draftee
played by Donald Sutherland.
You could never mistake Donald
SUtherland for an innocent, little
joker. There is malice in his eyes,
and malice in his jokes. He says
little in this movie. One person
tells ‘Hawkeye to “save your
rapierlike wit for the clamdig-
gers.”

Trapper John is played by EI-
liot Gould. He does not say much
in this movie either. Hawkeye and
Trapper John do not play the Marx
brothers very often, and when
they do it does not seem very
funny. Their pleasures come out
of the practical jokes ‘which they

play. ©

Frank Burns is. played by
Robert Duvall. His part is not
funny at all. Duvall plays Burns as
an incompetent surgeon who goes
mad. Soldiers die from his incom-
petence. Burns shrugs it all off
and goes on with his prayers,
which go on forever. He is a re-
ligious fanatic who reads his Bible
constantly and ascribes all events
to the will of God. Nothing good
or human exists in Frank Burns to

‘make us laugh or take pity.

Margaret O/’Houlihan is
played by Sally Kellerman. She
represents all the puritanical zeal
of the army, criticizing all those
around her who do not follow reg-
ulations or have a good attitude.
However, she is also a nym-
phomaniac. By exposing her lusts
and desires, Hawkeye and Trap-
per John make her military stance
ridiculous.

Father Mulcahey is played by
Rene Auberjunois. You_may rec-
ognize him as Clayton, the pomp-
ous chief of staff on the TV series
Benson..Father Mulcahey is-a lost
and innocent man. He really
would, like to help the people

around him, but he is helpless.
None of his prayers or the god to
which he prays can do anything
against the cruelties of war. The
poor priest can only wander the
camp trying to give absolution.
His ineffectiveness is highlighted
when Mulcahey tries to give the
last rites to the wounded, but one
of the doctors tells him to quit be-
cause the man is dead.

The entire message of this
movie is that all such remedies are
useless against the hard realities of
war. Religion, military honor,
marriage vows, and the other sa-
cred values of peace have no
meaning in war. War is a constant
stream of violence and absur-
dities. The only refuge from war is
to break out of the rules and prac-
tice some private violence and de-
cadence. Burns is teaching a Ko-
rean boy to read the Bible when
Hawkeye first comes to the base.
Hawkeye takes the Bible out of his
hands and replaces it with a
Playboy.

In this army unit, indifference
af escape are the only ways to
become insulated from the war:

Unlike the TV series, the doctors
make no speeches and assume no
poses about love and concern for
humanity. They do their job com-
petently and quickly, but they
waste no time to be gentle. Their
services to mankind have no em-
bellishments. The main goal for '
people stuck in a war is to work
hard and well in order to have
more free time..

There is nothing pleasant. in
M*A*S*H the movie to remind a
fan of the TV series. Despite its R
rating, it is not very graphic. In-
stead it concentrates on showing
the ordinary brutalities of war. I-
didn’t laugh much, except for the
hilarious football game near the
end. That combination of violence
and absurdity was a great indict-
ment of war. However, you may
like. this. sardonic and bleak
movie. In this movie you hear the
lyrics to the theme song of M*A*

' §*H, “Suicide Is Painless.” If that

title is funny to you, then you
should like the movie. It is show-
ing on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and |
9:45 p.m. in Love Auditorium.

Picasso exhibit
graces Charlotte
for first time

By JESSICA FISHER and DIANA
MILLER _
The first Picasso exhibit in North

Carolina presents a rare opportunity to

enjoy a showcase of pieces by this great

master.

Indeed, Picasso’s quotation on the~

wall of the Jerald Melberg Gallery in
Charlotte asserts his eminence as the
foremost twentieth century artist: “My
mother once said to me; ‘If you decide to
become a soldier, you will become a gen-
eral; if you decide to become a priest, you
will become a pope . . .’ Well, instead I
decided to become an artist and I became
Picasso.” :

The pieces in this exhibit were
selected from the large collection owned
by Picasso’s granddaughter Marina
Picasso.’ These works are representative
of the breadth of the artist’s career and il-
lustrate various mediums through which
Picasso expressed himself. The subjects
of many of these works include the legen-
‘dary romances, two world wars,
- bullfights, children and pets which influ-
enced Picasso’s life.

This collection incorporates various
modes of expression’such as lithography,
ceramics, oil painting, sketching, en-
graving, aquatinting, and etching. There
were quité a few pieces which engaged

our interest. One example is “Flight of

__the Dove,” a lithograph which uses broad

strokes to depict the conventional symbol
of peace. Another captivating piece was a
large oil on canvas entitled “Bust of a
Matador.” This work, a prototype of
cubism, a movement founded by
Picasso, is painted in brilliant hues of
orange, turquoise, and green. Two com-
panion pencil sketches entitled “Woman
Leaning” offered a unique opportunity to
view two variations on the same subject.
Both sketches are executed in simple
lines yet one is an embellished version of
the other. In “The Smoker,” an aquatint,
the interplay of vivid colors such as yel-
low, pink, orange, green, and blue was
particularly appealing. The lithograph
pictured, “Portrait of Francoise” is an
exemplary portrayal of Picasso’s artistic
talent.

Picasso in Charlotte will be exhibited
at the Jerald Melberg. Gallery through

Nov. |. The gallery is located across the -

street from Spirit Square. Hours are. 10-
5:30 Tuesday through Friday, and 11-4
on Saturdays. Not only is this exhibit cul-
turally edifying, but it also provides an
excellent opportunity to beat the last mi-
nute Christmas shopping frazzles. Atl
pieces in the exhibit are for sale.
