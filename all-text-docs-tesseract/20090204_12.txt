After winning their last meet at home on
Sunday Against the Virginia Military Insti-
tute, the Wildcats continued their Southern
Conference home swing against the Spartans
of UNC-Greensboro.

UNC-Greensboro came into the meet
with a record of 2-1 in the Southern Confer-
ence and 2-10 overall, so the Wildcats knew
it would be tough to get a win and move their
SoCon record up to 2-1.

The match started at the 285 pound
weight class. The Spartans’ Joe Sheffield de-
feated Charlie Wolff ’11 by a score of 15-3.
This gave Sheffield’s team an early overall
lead of 4-0. In the 125 pound weight class,
Mitchell Johnson defeated Ben Altman °10
by a tally of 11-4, which extended the Spar-
tans’ lead out to 7-0. Alex Radsky ’11 at the
133 pound weight class was able to force an
overtime period, but Casey Boyle prevailed
7-5, giving UNC-Greensboro a lead of 10-0.

In the 141 pound weight class, Vitaly
Radsky ’11 was unable to stay with the Spar-
tans’ Chris Bencivenga, and was defeated
15-4, which gave the Spartans an overall lead
of 14-0. The Spartans extended their lead to
17-0 after the 149 pound weight class match,
as David DeCamp ’12 was unable to take
down the Spartans’ Ben Wilmore. Wilmore

took the match by a final tally of 8-6. The
Spartans continued their dominance in the
157 and 165 pound weight class matches. In
the 157 match, Andrew Saunders took down
Joe McGinley ’11 by a score of 11-0 and in
the 165 match, Victor Hojilla defeated Tyler
Mullen ’12 11-2. When these matches came
to aconclusion the lead for UNC-Greensboro
had been pushed to 25-0.

The Wildcats were finally able to get on
the scoreboard after the 174 pound weight
class match as Kevin Cook 09 defeated
Brett Miller 4-3, which cut the Spartan lead
to.25-3. The Spartans finished the match in
the same manner as they started, by dominat-
ing the Wildcat wrestlers. In the 184 pound
weight class, Mikal McKee defeated Sam
O’ Hair ’09 by a score of 7-6. O’Hair wrestled
valiantly but was unable to come away on
top. McKee’s win pushed the Spartan lead to
28-3. In the final match of the day, which was
the 197 pound weight class, UNC-Greens-
boro’s Ryan Sughrue defeated Jorge Estrada
’12. He pinned Estrada in 3:33, and this win
gave the Spartans a final win of 34-3.

The Wildcats dropped a tough match to
the Appalachain State Mountaineers Tuesday
night 25-9. This loss brought their overall
record to 4-10 and 1-3 in the SoCon.

In their next match, the ’Cats will take on
Anderson University and Belmont Abbey at
Anderson on Feb. 13 beginning at 6 p.m.

Robinson reaches milestone, but
losing streak hits six for ‘Cats

During the current six-game skid, the
Wildcats have not witnessed any shortage
of individual performances. But that’s just
the problem—it’s the intangibles, like how
the team clicks and flows, that have kept the
squad in a rut. Saturday’s match-up at Wof-
ford brought more of the same, as the team
lost 72-86 while Mercedes Robinson °10
eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for her career.

Even fourteen minutes into the first half,
the team showed no indication of letting the
game slip out of its hands. After a layup by
Mandy Halbersleben ’09, the ’Cats tied the
game at 33. One turnover later and Wofford
grabbed the lead 35-33 and held it for the re-
mainder of the game.

Up 48-37 at the half, the South Carolin-
ian rivals led by as many as 23 in the second
half. Davidson could not make enough of a
dent in the lead to set itself for a comeback.

In dissecting the numbers behind this loss,
the difference in shooting percentages stands
out most clearly. While the Wildcats hung
around 40 percent from the fioor for most
of the game—a respectable tally— Wofford

blow past Catamounts at home

The Davidson men’s basketball team
continued its march through the Southern
Conference by defeating the top three teams
in the conference’s North division over the
past week. The Wildcats knocked off Chatta-
nooga 92-70 last Wednesday, escaped Sam-
ford 55-52 on Saturday, and overran Western
Carolina on Monday by an 89-65 margin.

The Wildcats defeated Chattanooga be-
hind 32 points from Stephen Curry °10.
Curry’s total included a 75-foot heave that
brought the first half to a close. The shot
ignited a 13-3 run that allowed Davidson to
take a 51-31 lead early in the second half and
essentially salt the game away.

Curry was far from alone in excelling
against the Mocs. Andrew Lovedale “09
continued his strong season by scoring 17
points and hauling in 12 rebounds. Fellow
post player Ben Allison ’11 added 12 points,
while sharpshooters Bryant Barr ’10 and Will
Archambault.’ 10 added nine and eight points
respectively. Stephen McDowell led Chatta-
nooga with 17 points.

Chattanooga was unable to capitalize on
its large disparity in free throws attempted,
shooting only 60 percent (21-35) from the
charity stripe while the Wildcats shot 80 per-
cent (12-15).

The seli-out crowd at McKenzie Arena
did see the end of one Wildcat streak, though.
Nicchaeus Doaks’ basket 32 seconds into the
game gave Chattanooga a 2-0 lead and ended
a streak of 238:22 of game time in which Da-
vidson had not trailed. The Wildcats came
just short of extending their streak to the
equivalent of six full games.

Davidson’s trip to Alabama to take on
Samford proved to be much more eventful.
The Bulldogs, in their first season of South-
em Conference play, fought tooth-and-nail
and were only narrowly defeated at the end.
Curry scored 20 points to lead the Wild-
cats, but shot only 6-20 from the floor (2-11
from three-point range) and failed to score

over the game’s final ten minutes. Lovedale .

contributed another double-double with 13
points and 12 rebounds while Steve Rossiter
°09 added nine points.

Davidson looked as though it would leave
the Bulldogs in the dust at the game’s onset,
out-scoring Samford 22-5 to begin the game.
The Wildcats proceeded to go ice-cold from
the floor, failing to hit a field goal over the
final ten minutes of the half and allowing the
Bulldogs to close within 27-22 at halftime.

Davidson opened up a ten-point lead in
the second half, but Samford closed the gap
to one three times, the last on a layup by Jim
Griffin with 32 seconds to play that made the
score 53-52. Barr hit two free throws to ac-

With under ten seconds remaining in last Wednesday’s
game at Chattanooga, Mocs guard Nicchaeus Doak drove
to the basket but missed the lay-up with four seconds
remaining. Andrew Lovedale ‘og pulled down the rebound

and found Curry who’s amazing three-quarter court shot
beat the buzzer to put the Wildcats ahead 41-28 at the half. gz

count for the final margin. Trey Montgomery
missed a triple with ten seconds to play but
the rebound went out of bounds off David-
son. Josh Bedwell’s attempt to tie was off the
mark also and the ball Janded in Rossiter’s
hands as the horn sounded.

The game was gruesome statistically,
with Davidson shooting 32 percent from the
floor and Samford shooting 34 percent. Once
again, free throw shooting was a critical sta-
tistic. The Wildcats were 13-14 (92.9 per-
cent) from the charity stripe while the Bull-
dogs were only 14-21 (66.7 percent). Curtis
West led Samford with 13 points.

Davidson rebounded from Saturday’s
sloppy showing with a clinical performance
against Western Carolina. Curry scored 26
points (20 in the first half) to lead five Wild-
cats in double figures. Barr and Brendan
McKillop ~11 each hit four three-pointers on
their way to 14 points. Lovedale also scored
14 and added four blocks, while defensive
specialist Max Paulhus Gosselin ’09 added
12 points.

Davidson never trailed and was only
briefly threatened. Up 13-9, Curry recorded a
four-point play and would score the next ten
points for Davidson as the Wildcats opened
a 49-31 advantage at halftime. The Wildcats
continued to apply their pressure in the sec-
ond half, forcing 20 turnovers and opening
an 86-48 lead with 6:34 to play. The Cata-
mounts. shot 39.6 percent for the game and
were led by Harouna Mutombo’s 15 points.

The victories allowed Davidson to
extend its conference winning streak to 42
