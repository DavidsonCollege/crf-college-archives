Davidson’s fourmost violinists play Vail Commons

Merrill, Parker, Scrivano, and Davis give spring recital with diverse program

By Jay Hupson

Four of Davidson College’s
premiere musicians were oncenter
stage last Sunday night at Vail
Commons. Freshmen Amanda

Merrill and ‘Elizabeth Parker,

Sophomore Vidalia Scrivano, and
Junior Emily Davis performed their
spring violin recital.

All four musicians study un-
der the instruction of Davidson’s
resident violinist Jane Hart, and
they also play in the Davidson
College Symphony Orchestra.

The program included music
from the Baroque to the Romantic
musical periods, including the
works of composers Antonio
Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
Henryk Wieniawski, and César
Franck.

Each performer also played a
few smaller pieces either solo or
solo with piano.

For the finale, all four instru-

nature, compared the play to “a
fable” anda “metaphor for life,”
acknowledging that the genre
of science fiction had given
Henley a certain type of “free-
dom” in how she chose to de-
pict “the deadness of the world”
and to what extent she could
carry the social satire.

Umberger described the
genesis of Charlotte Rep’s Sig-
nature as “the biggest collabo-
ration” with which he had ever
been involved. There are elabo-
rate sets and frequent scene and
costume changes — notto men-
tion the barrage of huge video
screens, hallmarks of the de-
sensitization of Henley’s char-
acters and the distance technol-
ogy has put between them.

The production had an in-
teresting kaleidoscope effect,
making the tragedies of these
people into almost a freak-show
carnival too surreal to be terri-
fying. /

Yet as outrageous and col-
orful as it was visually, the story
itself was not compelling. Per-
haps because of the larger-than-
life presence of the video
screens, the constant movement
and swift changes in plot never
allowed us time to care what
would happen next.

Imagine watching a two-
hour MTV commercial full of
disconcerting images, crazy
plastic people, and subtle so-
cial commentary, and you’ll
know what to expect from
Henley’s Signature.

Call Mary Clare, Jeff,

mentalists teamed up and played
Vivaldi’s Concerto in B Minor for
Four Violins and Continuo.
Clearly, this was the highlight of
the concert.

Vail Commons proved to be
extremely intimate — moreso than
either Hodson Hall or Love Audi-
torium. The four string players
made the music more personal by
performing on the same level as
the audience.

Although the acoustics of the
dining hall are not that fantastic,
and the occasional interruption of
a printer from the Commons’ of-
fices was disturbing, the area
proved to be an excellent place to
hold a concert.

The concerto has three move-
ments: the opening Allegro, the
middle Largo-Larghetto, and the
closing Allegro. The allegro move-
ments are faster than the slow largo.

Each performer had a little
solo somewhere in the piece, but

-the most enjoyable aspect of the

concerto was the way the musi-

cians interacted. The musicians
played off each other, particularly
in the more energetic and lively
allegro movements. The four dif-
ferent parts intermingled to forma
single cohesive, seamless whole.
The quartet’s playing was very
tight, and this was helped by the
fact that the quartet communicated
extremely well.

Overall the program was very
well played, and it was a pleasure
to listen to. The music was ex-
tremely difficult and definitely
showed the caliber of these four
musicians. The artists have been
practicing for the whole semester,
and their work has undeniably paid
off.

They can be heard again in the

Davidson College Symphony Or-
chestra concert in Love Audito-
rium on Monday, April 24, per-
forming the overture to Mozart’s
Magic Flute, Symphony #45 by
Joseph Haydn, and Edward Grieg’s
Piano Concerto in A Minor. Dr.
James Swisher, Davidson’s resi-
dent pianist, will join them in the
Grieg concerto.

St. Patrick visits Hodson

Roger Nelson’s one-act play
explores the man behind the holiday

_ By DAVE WILLIARD

Staff writer

Distinguished scholar Roger
Nelson performed The Confession
of St. Patrickin Hodson Hall March
26. Set in the early 400s, the one-
man play follows St. Patrick’ s jour-
ney from Rome to Ireland and
chronicles his attempt, as the
island’s first Christian, to convert
the Irish heathens.

The play’s script is based on
translations of St. Patrick’s fifth
century Latin text. Written around
450, the Confession is the first
known Irish document. The text is
Biblical in nature, and the main
theme of the play is Patrick’s de-
sire to do God’s will.

Nelson, who portrayed St.
Patrick, is best known for his por-
trayal of John Wesley in The Man

from Aldersgate, another one-act
play which he has performed thou-
sands of times in over 30 countries.

Unfortunately, Nelson’s at-
tempt at an Irish accent fell apart
after the first five minutes. Also,
the adaption of the text to the stage
seemed to have an overly literary
feel and was presented in a confus-
ing, compressed manner. Nelson
tried to pull off some mood changes
that at best seemed forced.

Nevertheless, recounting St.
Patrick’s confession in a single act
is certainly achallenge, and Nelson
did an adequate job (sans accent)
with such limiting material.
