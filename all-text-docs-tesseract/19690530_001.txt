| EPC Sends Faculty

Limited ExCo Plan

The faculty Educational Policy Committee made
major changes in the student proposal for a pilot
Experimental College project at their meeting Mon-
day, according to Danny Clodfelter, freshman Rich
ardson Fellow who led the drive for the experimental

college.

“We feel that the EPC in practice has put so many

restrictions on our proposal
that they've killed the pro
gram,” Clodfelter said. “No
body now wants to carry
through the program, al-
though several students for-
merly had proposals.”

Dr. James M. Frederick-

sen, professor of chemistry.

and a member of the com-
mittee, pointed out that get-
ing the proposals through
the faculty next Thursday
would require a more struc-
tured set-up than the stu-
dents originally proposed.
“Our idea," said Clod-
felter, ‘‘was. for the college
to take some riske on some
highly motivated students.
I tnink they've simply failed
to catch the idea of what we
were trying to gct across.”

Cooks Receive
More Benefits

By GREG MITCHELL
Staff Writer

Fraternity representatives
voted to adopt a medical in-
surance ‘program for theit
cooks, to provide a minimum
sick leave program, and to
continue the present policy
of paying the cooks for holi-
days during the school year,
at a conference on the cook's
wages question Monday.

_The move came in accor
dance with the Student Life

Committee's recent recom.
mendation that Davidson
fraternities work directly

with the college administra.
tion in an effort to find «
solution ts the problem.

“I felt that the meeting
was extremely successful,”
said Robert J. Stephenson,
assistant business manager
for the college, ‘“‘and the re
sponse. from the individual
fraternities have been very
favorable.”

The fraternity representa-
tives at the meeting also
- decided to carry the problem
/of a specific wage increase
back to their respective
houses where members would
then vote on the matter.

Several of the representa-
tives indicated that their
fraternities had already de-
cided to ivicrease the week-
ly salaries of their cooks.

said this week. i

Clodféiter added that his
group would have accepted
some restrictions, but that
he felt the EPC had gone to
far. .

The added restrictions in
cluded provision that appli-
cants would not be excused
from area, major and gradu-
ation requirements, that
maximum credit would be
ihree courses, ahd that no
rising sophomore would be
admitted to the program un.
less he had already passed
at least two area exams.

Also a participant would
have to pay full Davidsoa
tuition, room and board fees
whether or not his prograin
took him away from the cam-
pus.

John }*. Williams, the stu-
dent member of the EPC,
said that the restriction re-
quiring freshmen to pass two
urea exams before entering
the program was for the
benefit of the student.

“We felt this would be an
advantage for the  sopho-
mores in that if they got
to tied up in this project,
they might fall behind in.
their preparation for the
other area exams and be un-
able to become juniors,’ Wil--
Viams said.

Fredericksen said that ne
felt that a student might be-
come caught up in his project
and thus tend to negate the
broad education wiich was
the spirit of the Blue Sky
proposals. .

bers.

Other additions would. re-

vise the composition of the
Investigating Committee and
specify the conditions under
which student rooms and
cars may be searched. Jf
approved by the students, the
faculty will vote on the re-
visions next Thursday.

SLC Batks
At 7 Of 10
New Rules

Phi Delta Theta and Phi
Gamma Lelta received per
mission from the faculty Stu:
dent Life Committee yester-
day to allow bousemothers
to reside off the fraternity
Court, said Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts,. Jr. -this
morning.

The SLC also returned to
President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. recommendations on
the "administrative regula-
tions by the Dean's Council.

Out of the 10 points in the
regulations, the. Burts said
the SLC approved only three.

Burls said there could be
some doubt about whether
the SLC's action on house-
mothers was final, since the
committee was not sure who
had the authority to make
the decision.

But he said the decisions
did not represent a. ‘‘policy -
change" on the part of the |
committee, but rather a trial
period for the ~residency

Yesterday's committee de-
cision represented a reversal
of a decision a week earlier,
when the commiftee in a tie
vote decided not to permit
the arrangement.

Burts said that further in-
vestigation by Dick Allison,
a student member of the
committee, had produced the
changed vote of yesterday.

Recommendations on the
Dean's Council report were
returned to Spencer, who
must make the final decision.
Burts emphasized that the

comments were not decisive,
but represented only ‘“‘the
feeling of the committee to
Dr. Spencer.’” ;
