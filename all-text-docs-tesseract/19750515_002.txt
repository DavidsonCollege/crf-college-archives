“The most important part of student government is for

students to be involved.”

Senate lacks power

By MARK GERGEN

The Senate, through its ac-
tions this year has shown itself
to be consistently unable to ac-
complish much. This can best
be seen in the issue of locks on
Watts. .

The Senate spent three
meetings considering the
problem, and somewhere in the
neighborhood of six hours. The
question was important; there
were interested students
present, and it concerned

student life, an area in which the
Senate should exercise power.

The actual discussion about
the locks was quite impressive,
with the Senate considering
both points of view, the ad-
-ministration’s and the stu-
dents’.

The Senate made an effort
to discover how those who lived
in Watts this year and last year
felt about the question, more
than the administration ever
tried todo.

Munce encourages students to lobby
for constitutional human rights

By JOHN MUNCE

Influence, process and pur-
suit are the key words in
student government in Spring
1975.

Influence has been exerted
and felt; this continues. Pro-
jects are in the works; the pro-
cess continues.

Pursuit is undertaken to en-
sure that these projects are
carried through to a decision
and that students. are heard
throughout the process. Pursuit
and vigilance continue.

What! No long list of ac-
complishments? A project list
is not an evaluation. The record
stands by itself; the evaluation
should help us look forward.

But there is a list. In
February an agenda was
published and adopted by the
Senate. The projects listed on it
are the ones in process now. The
Statement of Student Rights
and Responsibilities, ad-
missions, food services, the
union, etc. are still around and
kicking.

The mere fact of their con-
tinuation and pursuit owes
much to all the people who have
worked with the Senate and the
other agencies and committees
of the college throughout the
year, to all senators, and toSGA
officers, from the union to the
Y. They have done their work
and that is the important thing.

No, this is not an exhortation
for the protestant work ethic.
Davidson student style. It sim-
ply says that the most im-
portant part of student govern-
ment is for students to be in-
volved.

Get involved! Jeez, haven’t I
heard that before? Sure, but
maybe not with this twist. I
don’t mean that every student
should run to the nearest elec-
tion or join up at the closest
organization meeting.

All you néed to do is talk with
the people you see every day,
with maybe a special visit to
some of the big names. Lob-
bying is basically the function
of the Senate. Senators try to:
get the information, formulate
a program and then push.

Administrators are affected
by the responses of students.
But students must be there to be
heard and they must have their
facts straight and when this
happens, you have impact.

But this is only the first step.
The second step is the pursuit.
Once impact is made it must be
reinforced again and again.

Changing people

People will change when it
becomes too uncomfortable to
remain the same. People will
change when shows that the
arguments will not cease.
People will change when they
recognize that we know when
they are right and wrong and
will follow it up.

This takes more energy than
we sometimes have. Four years
isn’t very long, so we must con-
centrate our efforts to the things
going now. Even if we realize
that something won’t be
changed for five years, we can’t
afford to wait that long.

It is our job to push.

Platitudes are great, but what
about specifics? The Goals Com-
mittee proceedings and - the
Statement of Student Rights are
easy to grab.

The governance shift of the
past five years has forged some
changes and codified a lot of
tradition. It has had one definite
affect: the trustees play a
larger role in the ad-
ministration of the college.

The Board of Trustees has
decided to determine them-

selves what constitutes good

taste within the community, for
example. Is there such
disagreement that’ the deter-
miniation should rest in trustee
approval?

This action and its context af-
fect the status of students in the
community. Students may not
be assured that they did not

leave behind their con-
stitutional freedoms when they
entered Davidson.

Although they have asked for
responsibility and freedoms
which form the foundation of
the Judeo-Christian tradition
and the form of government for
which Davidson men have died
to protect, it appears that
students are not considered a
responsible constituency.

It is understandable that the
Trustees of a private institution
are concerned about the image
of that college. It is not un-
derstandable that rational men
support a system of respon-
sibility without giving com-
mensurate liberties.

Rights and freedoms are
given within the context of a
community, thus ensuring that
the responsibilities are
recognized. The Davidson
Faculty has certain guarantees
in the new constitution which
are placed within certain
restrictions.

This constituency neither

asked for nor received
unlimited freedom, only liber-
ties worthy of the name. Stu-
dents ask no more.

We must be vigilant, per-
suasive and aggressive in pur-
suing the guarantee of liberty
with responsibility. Students
cannot afford to simply drop
the issue.

At stake is the position and
respect accorded them as
adults, as members of a com-
munity dedicated to growth, as
the only constituency paying to
be here and for whom the in-
stitution exists.

Student constituency

The unique nature of the
student constituency forces
them to be concerned with
almost every area of the college.
It also makes them very in-
terested in the direction and
goals of the institution.

The Goals Committee has
reported. The sentiment of the
committee was that a long
range plan and some system of
monitoring decisions is
desparately needed. The
Trustees have charged the
president to produce such a
plan, while swallowing the rest
of the committee report. Now
students must pursue the issue
to ensure that they are in the
formulation process.

It is necessary that the
college maintain flexibility. The
punches will be hitting us har-
der and more often in the next
few years. But flexibility must
not be used as an excuse for
piecemeal decisions.

We can afford to plan as we go
when there is plenty of money.
There is no longer such an
abundance of the commodity,
so we had better make some
hard decisions now--and with
the students.

In large measure, who makes
the plan is irrelevant. What is
important is that it be a com-
munity plan and that the whole
community have a chance to
engage it its formulation and
implemetation.

This is the point at which
students must pursue the issues,
ask the difficult questions,
bring up the messy facts and
argue their case vehemently.
Much of the homework have
been done. The effort now must
be made to bring the planning
and decision into line with the
rational evaluation of the in-
formation.

Student government is a lob-
bying group which must chase
down the decisions and be con-
Stantly alert. The effectiveness
of any such froup still comes
down to one thing: Believing
that vou can do something
makes all the difference in the

_ world. ‘

Lawyers were contracted to
find out the liability to the
College should someone ever
get injured because of a lack of
action by the college. The effec‘
of Title Nine was also discussed
in some depth.

Three points

By the end of the three
meetings a few points were
clear. First a massive per-
ponderance of those living in
Watts don’t want the locks:
second, the screens in Watts are
a safety hazard; third, the
College except in extreme cir-
cumstances would not be liable;
four, Title Nine would make
commenserate security
measures necessary on all
dormitories.

The first major complaint
about the Senate comes in these
discussions. Time was wasted
in useless procedure. In the
final meeting the Senate went
through some masochistic
parliamentary maneuver for an
hour and a half which entailed
removing and replacing a few
passages a number of times.

Lack of power

Finally after much con-
sideration the Senate passed a
resolution calling for no locks,
and equal treatment in all
future episodes.

As far as I can tell, the effect
of the resolution was zero. The
locks are going back up on Wat-
ts this summer, barring legal
problems. This then is the
Senate’s largest problem; they
don’t have that much power.

If the administration wants
to they have no obligation to
listen to the Senate, so in’ any
case in which the desires of the
students differ from those of the
administration the net result
will. be zero.

The next incident highlights
another problem of the Senate,
militant apathy. At the begin-
ning of the year the Senate
passed a resolution on sub-
standard housing by a large
majority. In December a sur-
vey was needed to discover
what the problem was exactly,
to make the town eligible for a
government loan.

Three senators

Only three senators showed
up to help with that survey, and
\this dramatizes the third
problem. It is generally agreed
that a large part of what the
Senate accomplishés is due to
the work of individual senators
outside the Senate.

But some of the senators ap-
pear to be on the Senate just to
come to enough meetings not to
be mentioned in the paper, and
then vote. It’s true that not
many other students helped in
that survey, but senators ask
for the position and therefore
have some obligation to do
something extra.

Getting involved

This inactivity is not true for
the entire Senate, in particular
areas a single senator, or
maybe two have gotten in-
volved. Particularly in the area
of P.E. requirements, the
Union, ARA, and the housing
problem.

The power of appropriating a
limited amount of funds each
year is often pointed out as the
Senate’s main function. This is
true in that students'‘had an ex-
tra day. of counseling this year
because _ of it. Some
