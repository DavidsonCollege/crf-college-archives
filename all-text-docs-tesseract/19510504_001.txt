Red Cross Course

Ends This Week

Students at Davidson College
have recently had the opportunity
to take a course in water safety
instruction, Offered by the David-
son Athletic Association, the
course's purpose has been to train
students to be instructors in swim-
ming and life saving.

A total of thirty hours of train-
ing are included. The first fifteen
hours, which consist cf preliminary
training, were under the direction
of Gant Carlton and George

Knight. Mr. Marshall Upton, head

of the safety services of the Red
Cross chapter in Charlotte, has
been the instructor for the last fif-
teen hours of the course. Coopera-
tion between the college authorities
and the Charlotte Red Cross has
proved this program to be one of
the most worthwhile projects ‘car-
ried out recently in the Mecklen-
burg area. This is the second con-
secutive year during which this in-
Structors course has been presented,
and it is the hope of officials that
it can be offered during the spring
term of every school year.

The course, which terminated
Friday, included a review of life
saving techniques, a review of the
nine basic swimming strokes, and
the four classes of swimming—
beginner, intermediate swimmer, and
advanced. Emphasis during the
course was placed on teaching tech-
niques, and new Red Cross instruc-
tional films were used whenever
they were available. .

Those enrolled in the course were
Lewis Baker, Arthur Balk, George
Basop, Milard Coc, Dan Heizer,
John Ottley, Bill Reese, and Allan
Vance. Those renewing their in-
structors certificates were Ervin
Ellis and Dick Kelly.

AED ACHIEVES
GOAL OF YEAR

Last Monday night in the base-
ment lecture room of the Science

Building, the final goal of this
year’s development program of
Alpha Epsilon Delta, the national
pre-medical honor society, was
reached.

At that meeting, a film- and

slide lecture program on the oc-
currence, diagnosis, and subsequent
treatment and-or cure of the dread
“Cancer” problems, presented by
Dr. McChord Williams, chairman
Carolina Section American Can-
cer society an idea was started
which, it is hoped, will grow and
develop in the years to come to
its proper place of importance in
the life and thinking of this stu-
dent body.

This occurrence was the attend-
ance, for the first time, of u num-
ber of the people of the community
and members of the administration
and faculty of Davidson College.
This, AED believes, was the in-
ception of a type of program to
appeal to the entire community as
well as to the pre-medical students
at large on the campus. The society
welcomes visitors, and it is its
expressed aim in the. future to bring
to the campus a series of programs
that will develop a mature and
cooperative attitude toward medi-
cine and its functions in the minds
of the people of this community,
so that they may share their full
‘responsibility as mémbers of what
may be called the “health team”

| of this nation.

Dramatic Climax
To Arts Program

By ALDEN WILLIAMS

As a
1951 Kine Arts Week, Profes-
sor Raymond Tyson and a cast

‘of twenty, headed by Bob Gay,

will present Shakespeare's “‘Ju-
lius Caesar” in three acts to-
night and tomorrow night in
Chambers Auditorium. Tlie fes-

‘{tival climax is the result of a

month's work by the staff and
cast, and will be staged
in the abbreviated Globe
Theater production, eliminating the
last two acts. Since the theme’ of
the fourth and fifth acts is some-
what different from that of the
first three, and most familiar. acts,
this procedure is common. Profes-
sor Tyson stated last week that he
felt “dramatic and artistic justifi-
cation” for the action. |
Tyson stressed the fact that
the presentation would be con-
tinuous with no _ intermission,
and is expected to last about
an hour and a half. Mentioning
the obstacles that have pres-
sented themselves during the
closing days of rehearsal, he
implied that the shortening of

“Julius Caesar” has allowed

greater cooperation and concen-

tration on perfection of minor
parts.

As Caesar, Gay will head an ex-
perienced cast which includes Dick
Perkins as Brutus, Mac Bulgin as
Cassius and Tad Currie as Mark
Antony. Nancy Copeland and Dor-
othy Herring will take the roles of
Calpurnia and Portia respectively.

Asked to comment on any out-
standing features of the play, sup-
porting lead Mae Bulgin said,
“Although in this play individual
characters are of importance, the
success or failure of the production
is'to a very large degree dependant
on cooperation among the cast. This
is especially true in the crowd
scenes with a sense of common
action and interchange among the
characters. The core of the play,
and the dominating spirit as I see
it is to be gained from careful exe-
cution of the mob and_ peasant
scenes. To achieve the cooperation
which we seek, I. think that, in the
main, careful directing is required.
We have this in Professor Tyson.”

On the question of future
productions of Shakespeare or
any of the clasical playwrights.

Tyson expressed the hope that

Praises Conductor

“This Davidson Band is one of
the really outstanding college bands
in the country,” said Dr. Edwin
Franko Goldman, as he paused be-
tween tumbers to address the large
audience in Chambers Auditorium
which had come to hear the concert
last Sunday afternoon at which Dr.
Goldman was guest conductor. “I
heard this band two years ago at
the meeting of the American Band-
master’s Association in Charlotte,”
he continued, “and | was very much
impressed with them then. Once
again they are giving a truly fine
performance.”

The white-haired “March King’”’
also had glowing words of praise
for James Christian Pfohl, Director
of Music at Davidson and conduc-
tor of the Davidson Band. He
complimented Mr. Pfohl particular-
ly on his selection of music which
the Davidson Band plays, calling
attention to the fact that three of
the numbers played during the first
part of the program were works
written expressly for the band and
played for the first time by the
Goldman Band. Dr. Goldman spoke
briefly of the work done through
the Goldman Band of resurrecting
works for band by the better known

older composers and of. encourag-
ing the best of modern composers
to write for this medium. Citing
his forty years of endeavor in this
field, Dr. Goldman spoke proudly
of the fact that all of the best mod-
ern composers are now writing for
band as well as for orchestra, re-
ferring particularly to sucht men as
Ralph Vaughan Williams, the con-
temporary British composer, and
Gustav Holst. He called attention

Mr. Pfohl has announced
that the band will present two
campus concerts during the re-
mainder of the school year.
The first of these will be pre-
sented on Tuesday cvening.
May 8th, in front of Chambers
Building. These _ twilight
concerts on the campus will
revive a custom much enjoyed
by the student body and the
Davidson community in pre--
vious years. The concert Tues-
day will begin at 7:30 p. m.

to the fact that under Mr. Pfohl's
leadership the Davidson Band was
playing the best of the music writ-
ten for band.

Dr. Goldman captured the com-
plete interest of his andience with

pus honorary athletic fraternity.

ious tests. Students may work to-
ward membership in Sigma Delta

school year.

year are: President, Bill Pritchett;

Band,

his account of his early days as a
musician, drawing an appreciative
Jaugh by recalling that he had been
discharged from the first band in
which he had played and told that
he was utterly lacking in musical
talent. He spoke of organizing his
“Own band.” the now famous Gold-
man Band, t. prove that a band
could play just as musically as
the finest symphony orchestra and
concluded by inviting anyone in
the audience who happened to be
in New York this summer to the
nightly concerts by the Goldman
Band in Central Park.

During the concert Sunday, Dr.
Goldman conducted the Davidson
Band in playing five of his own
marches including, at the audience's
request, his most popular march,
“On the Mall.” Also included in
Dr. Goldman’s share of Sunday’s
program were “Come Sweet Death”
by Bach, the beautiful chorale
“Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,” also
by Bach, the “Slow March from
‘Scipio’ ** by Handel and the ma-
jestic tone poem “Finlandia,”
which Dr. Goldman had played
under the direction of its composer,
Jean Sibelius, during Sibelius’ first
trip to America.
