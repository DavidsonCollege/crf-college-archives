E.T.S. Announces Spring Date
For Medical Admission Test

Princeton, N. J.—The Medical
Coltege Admission Test, required
of applicants by a number of lead-
ing medical colleges throughout the
country, will be given twice again
during the current calendar year,
according to Educational Testing
Service, which prepares and ad-
ministers the test for the Associa-
tion of American Medical Colleges.

Candidates may take the MCAT
on Saturday, May 13, 1950, or on
Monday, November 6, 1950, at ad-
ministrations to be held at more
than 300 local centers in all parts
of the country, The Association of
American Medical Colleges, through
its Committee on Student Per.
sonnel Practices, recommertds that
candidates for admission to classes
starting in the fall of 1952 take the
May test. The results will then be
available to institutions in the early
fall when many medical colleges
begin the selection of their next
freshman class.

The MCAT consists of tests of
general scholastic ability, a test on
understanding of modern society,
and an achievement test in science.
According to ETS, no special prep-
aration other than a review of
science subjects is necessary. All
questions are of the objective type.

Application forms and a Bulle-
tin of Information, which gives de-
tails of registration and administra-
tion, as well as sample questions,
are available from pre-medical ad-
visers or directly from Educational
Testing Service, Box 592, Prince.
ton, N. J. Completed applications
must reach the ETS office by Aprit
29 and October 23, respectively, for
the May 13 and November 6 ad-
ministration. —

curity against tyranny on the part
of the government.

The advocates of deficit finan-
cing are practically without excep-
tion free spenders. Some of them
simply find it inconvenient to raise
funds by taxation to pay for all
they would like to do. Others claim
to have discovered some economic
principle that makes it positively
desirable for the government to run
a deficit. Those who find it incon-
venient and unnecessary to pay
for things usually insist’ that the
country, has not suffered any bad
economic effects because of the
continued deficits of the past twen-
ty. years. On the contrary, they as-
sert, we have enjoyed a rousing
prosperity, at least during the lat-
ter part of the period. As one writ-
er has phrased the matter, “If
Americans weathered this amazing
climb in the national debt with-
out any serious difficulties, noth-
ing alarming is in sight if an order-
ly and continuous increase marks
the peacetime years ahead.” (Rob-
ert K, Pepper, “What's Good About
The National Debt?” At least this
is like saying if an- automobile will
take a curve at fifty miles an hour,
it will take it at fifty-five, and at
sixty, and so on. There are doubt-
less some slrivers who hold to that
theory, but their last words are apt
to be, “We are getting along fine
so far.” America is a wealthy land,
and such a land can stand a lot ot
financial nonsense without going
over the brink of disaster, but to
assert that there isn't any brink is
+o-cutveri oneself of complete ig-
norance of human history. There
is nothing more certain than that
there is a brink and that nation af-
ter nation has gone over it. It
would be much more sensible for
the advocates of deficit spending to
assert that what others would re-
gard a catastrophe they would con-
sider a desirable state of affairs.
This is, of course, the position open-
ly taken by’ certain collectivists who
would welcome national bankruptcy
as a means of destroying the sys-
tem of private ownership. It is
clear tHat we should come to some
understanding as to what we mean
by a disaster. If by disaster we
mean such burdens of taxation as
would make it impossible for the
system of production under pri-
vate ownership to function or such
an inflation of prices as would
transfer the wealth of the indus-
trious and the thrifty to the indolent
and spendthrift, then it can be defi-
nitely asserted that continued de-
ficit financing will lead to disaster.

_ We may even question the asser-

tion that this country has not al-
ready encountered “serious difficul-
ties” on account of deficit financing
during the past twenty years.
Whether the tremendous shifts of
wealth and income that accompany
even so moderate an inflation as
that which we have experienced are
to be regarded as “serious difficul.
ties” depends upon which side of
the shift one happens to have been
on. Whether monumental levies on
the people's income appear to con-
stitute “serious difficulties” depends
upon whether one’s income has
risen faster than the tax levies.
Whether governmental interferenc-
es with markets seem to create
“serious difficulties,’ depends upon
whether one benefits more from in-
terventions in his favor than he
suffers because of jnterventions in
his favor than he suffers because of
interventions in favor of others.

Rip Van Winkle couldn’t sleep
for 20 years nowadays. He would
be up working on his income tax
and then getting ready for cen-
sus enumerators.

Cabinet Considers
YMCA Criticisms

Last Monday evening the meet-
ing opened by Randy Taylor voic-
ing the criticisms of “Y" work dis-
cussed at the Hall Prayer Meeting.
There were many criticisms sub-
mitted, the main one dealing: with
the lack of recreation facilities.
The Cabinet feels that this has par-
tially been taken care of by the
opening of the new gymnasium. No
hope of any major changes are ex-
pected until the plans for the new
student union building are complet-
ed,

ship between denominations as well,
as individuals was discussed. Ten
Davidson men attended the meet-
ing.

The members of the “Y” Cabinet
and other men who had freshmen
groups durjng orientation week
were urged to again, visit these
freshmen. Dean Bailey had men-
tioned the fact that these leaders
would be of the same service in
answering freshmen questions the
second semester as they had been
the first.

Jim Murray gave very encourag-
ing news on the interview Monday
afternoon with Dr. Alec Bachlor
and Rev. Lawrence Bottoms. Df.
Bachtor is the chairman of Negro
work in the Southern Presbyterian
Conference, and Rev. Bottoms is
Regional Director in the Syedecor
Memorial Synod. _

would not have prevented a war
but would have made it even morc.
terrifying. As obvious as this state-
ment is I still shall try to show
why I believe this.

Many people, when thinking of
another war, still apply in their
thoughts the idea of war and its
picture as it was known during re-
cent history. They think of war to
be a weighing-scale of the nations,
a search for power and domination
a fight for natural rescources and
for export markets, Also being fa-
miliar with the technics of fighting
the homefront of ‘a nation and thus
adding the psycic factor in war
technic, they still think of battles,
armies and strong airforces as be-
ing the decisive factors in a war
If going out from this viewpoint
they might be able to find some
kind of justification in what Dr.
Fuchs said to be his motives. But
we have to understand that this
viewpoint no longer can be applied
when thinking about the next war.
And why can this not be done.

What will be the factors that will
decide the next war if we should
ever have one? Is this to say that
no armies will have any place in
another struggle between the na-
tions of this world?

. No, ‘but the reasons go deeper.
The next war will first of alt be
one of ideas and ideals. There will
be a struggle between different
conceptions of what should be the
setup of human society. And in
a sence this war has started already,
more than that, it is going on ever
since Karl Marx formed his com-
munistic conception of human so-
ciety. -“

I believe that the constant devel-
apment of the history of human so-
ciety is now and then interrupted
by some kind of explosion or clo.
lision, caused by the existence of
two extremes, which then causes
the birth or beginning of a new
kind of human society, a society
with different ideas, values and
conceptions. For example, as Alex-
ander the Great conquered the Per-
sian Empire two different cultures
collided and formed a new culture,
which we still find today. And J
furthermore believe, that we ere
about to witness another of these
collision.

The Christian concept of the val-
ue of the human being and the form
of the society it should form, and
the extreme that developed partly
out of this concept and that is
known as capitalism is one of the
extremes. The individual with all its
freedoms is the most important and
decisive factor in this society. The
sence of a community life, suffers
through the extreme stress put up-
on the individual. On the other side
we find the communistic form of
society, in which the individual is
nothing and the community is every-

thing.

These two extremes cannot pos-
sible exist side by side. We are
about to see- this more and more
every day. One of theni, it seems,
must win over the other... Whether
this struggle is carried out by ar-
mies and airforces or not, is not
that important. Because it cannot be
decidedby a military victory of the
one over the other. The only thing,
a war in its known sence could ac-
complish would be the total de-
struction of our existing society,
Thus human beings would be forced
by the circumstances existing ‘to
form a society, which necessarily
had to be a new kind although it
would contain parts of both of the
former ones.

This war could be prevented, if
Dr. Fuchs’ assumption would be
right. But it would not at all change
the fact, that some sort of solu-
tion has to be found. It could pre-
vent the total destruction of our
existing human societies by force,
but would then leave the question
open as how it could be changed.
Because we have to be aware of
the fact, that the forms of society
as existing right now in America
and Russia, are going to change.

If considering all this from the
viewpoint of the general course of
human history .I1 personally come
to the conclusion that the question
as to what role the H-bomb is go-
ing to take in a future military war
is not the most important issue
that has to be aken into considera.
tion by the governments of all na-
tions. Because doing this means to
assume that war will be inevitable
ands that it is only a question of
what weapons will be used.

I think that the greatest task
not only of our governments but
of the entire human race is to find

a substitute for war. I do not know.

where we can find it. It might be
found within the teachings of
Christ or somewhere clse, But I be-
