Wofford Terriers prove a
new breed of dog this year

Davidson ends up on losing side of 51—0 score

By GIGGY MAXWELL

This past Saturday’s game,

to the uninformed, might have
seemed like another opportu-
nity for a Davidson football
victory. After all, hadn’t the
Wildcats split their previous
four meetings with the Terri-
ers? Wasn't that the only team
Coach Gatto had beaten prior
to this year? We had the Terri-
ers’ number. Our chances
were, at worst, those of a coin
flip.

You could have flipped that
coin forever and it never would
have come up ‘Cats as Wofford
defeated Davidson 51 - 0.

A lot has happened over the
past year and the teams that
met on Saturday were two
teams going in completely
opposite directions.
Davidson's football program
has been decimated by trustees
and injuries. Only 39 players
suited up for Saturday’s game
and several are now being

forced to play both offense and
defense.

The Terriers, on the other
hand, moved to Division II
from NAIA last season. That
means that they can give out
even more scholarships than
before. They have one of the
top freshman quarterbacks in
the country, regardless of Divi-
sion.

When you give out schol-
arships you get those kind of
players.

The Wildcats didn’t help
themselves any by not being
mentally ready for the game.
On their second play from
scrimmage they were forced to
use a timeout becuase players
didn’t know where they were
supposed tobe. Several motion
penalties alsostalled this initial
drive.

When the Wildcats tried to
line up for a fieldgoal, holder
Matt Matheney didn’t need
much help in noticing that

there were only eight people on
the field for Davidson. Their
second timeout was wasted
and the game wasn’t even half-
way through the first quarter of
play
When the Wildcats finally
did get down to playing, they
couldn’t stop any of Wofford’s
backs.

At the end of the half, with
the score 37 -0, Wofford had al-
ready accumulated 390 yards
on the ground on their way toa
528- yard offensive effort on
the day.

There were no bright spots
for the Wildcats. They just
picked up the pieces and drove
home.

This week’s opponent,
Southern Conference affiliate
VML, offers little consolationas
they have been doormats for
their opponents this year and
will be looking to take out a
little frustration on the
Davidson Wildcats.

What running a

marathon can do?’

What I learned from running :
26 miles at one time:

1) that if you walk around like you are in pain and people
ask, “What's the matter?” it is cool tosay,“Irana —

3) that the next four miles suck.

4) that the next four miles also suck.
