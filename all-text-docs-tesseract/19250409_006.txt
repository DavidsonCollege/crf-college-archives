THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 9,.1925

Fresh Nine Plays Two
Big Games Junior Week,

Rockingham High and Duke Uni-
versity Both Play on Richardson |
Field

The Freshman baseball season will get
under way during the Easter holidays.
The first game will be with Rockingham |
High, to be played at 3:30, Friday, on |
Richardson field. |

Rockingham has a strong team this |
year, consisting mainly of the men who
won the State Prep football champion- |
ship this last season. Broyles, their all-
southern prep quarter will probably
pitch for the opposing team Friday while
Oden will more than likely hurl for the
Davidsonians.

On Saturday ‘the Wildkittens will meet
the Duke freshmen on the home field.
Poole will probably pitch this game for
the Davidson Fresh. The following
Monday and Tuesday the team will go
to Raeford, where they will play two!
consecutive games with American
Legion there, made up of high
school and college stars in and about
Raeford.

The schedule will be a hard one and
although Coach Rawson has lost some of
his good prospects, including Harrison
and Edgar, on account of sickness and
sprained limbs, the outlook for the Fresh
scason is bright.

team

The lineup will probably be as follows:
Catcher—Wilson or McNeal.

Second Base—McAuley.
Shortstop—Kugler.
Third Base—Dulen.

Center Ficld—Johnson. °

the bleachers were found to be insecure.
Gastonia was forced to refuse to handle
the games on account of this. Bids were
received from Winston-Salem, Greens-

was considered the desirable and
profitable place, it was arranged for the
Carolina game to be played there. This
game is under the auspices of the Salis-

Military Men Honored
By Scabbard and Blade

Local Chapter Initiates Five Men
Who Are Prominent—Captain
Dougherty Also

The local chapter af the Scabbard and
Blade held an important meeting Satur-
day night, March 25. Besides the reg-
ular business there was an election of
officers and five new members initiated.
The new are: Capt. R.’°D.
Daugherty, A. S. Jones, Jr., Woodrow
Wilson, B. U. Ratchford, and George
Smith.

The Secabbard,and Blade is a national
military fraternity in which membership

members

is attained only through meritorious
work and strict adherence to business
along this line of endeavor. The local

chapter was installed at Davidson in the
spring of 1922 and since that time it has
been the coveted goal for endeavor of
the men intreested in the military de-
partment. There are only a few men
clected to the organization and the ones
who chosen have
been marked for their creditable actions
during their performance of duty. The
membership of the local chapter is neces-
sarily small which makes it more of a
distinction for those who are successful
in obtaining membership. Besides the
new initiates the local chapter has as
members: Al Lake, W. C. Ramsey, J. P.
Hendrix, Litch Huie, Jim Gudger, J. A.
Thompson, Bob Kimzey, Milton Thomas-
son and Joe Earnest.

All of these men have been prominent
inthe military work on the campus and

are are those who

are to be commended on winning mem-
bership to the fraternity. Although the
local chapter is comparatively new it
has already established itself on a firm
foundation and is one of the most sought

STUDENT REGISTRATION
RAPIDLY PRQGRESSING

The registrations for next year's
courses are well under way and no doubt
will be practically finished by the end of
this week. All students that expect to
return to college next fall are required
to sign up fortheir courses of study be-
tore April 15th. After this date a fee of
$2 will be required of all those who
register. This plan eliminates a great
deal of confusion at the beginning of the
fall term. Only the incoming Fresh-
men have to have their courses arrang-
ed after they enter in the fall.

Mr. Hengeveld is in charge of the reg-
istrations of the rising Sophomore class,
and he reports that nearly all of the pres-
ent Freshmen have registered.’

Professor Foreman directing the
registrations of the, rising Junior class,
and Professor Fleagle of the rising
Senior class. About two thirds of the
men have attended to this, all are expect-
cd to register before April 15th to avoid
