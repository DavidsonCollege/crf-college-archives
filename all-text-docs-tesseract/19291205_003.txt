Side Line Shots
At How the Wildcat Can Fight
By P. R. Alderman

Davidson 13—Duke 12 sure did end the

1929 season in Wildcat fashion for the
Red and Black eleven!

Captain Thad Brock played the
most spectacular game of his career
against Carolina—until he led his
eleven against Duke.

“Red” -Parrish found Sam Buie’s passes
more to his liking than those of his team-
mates, causing three of the Blue Devil’s
heaves.to go wrang.

That Davidson has lost a great line-
man in the person of Ledyard De-
Camp was proven beyond doubt in
the Turkey Day battle. He'll be missed

next year.

The old pigskin was certainly hard to
keep up with the way the Blue Devils and
Wildcats handled it—30 to 40 yards a
clip was the order of the day.

That 44-yard run of. Joe McCall
through the line for a tally was one of
the greatest of his many brilliant
dashes this year.

Points after touchdowns have been
aptly named “Brock” points by a recent
writer and no wonder because Thad’s

made good 10 out of 14 tries.

The Blue Devils exhibited an un-
usually powerful running attack
against the Wildcats, but found the
Davidson line too stubborn when the
goal was close.

Believe It Or Not—By Ripley: Captain
Brock of Davidson runs 102 yards but

fails to score—against Duke University
November 28, 1929,

Sam Buie is one of the greatest
passes in the South but needs a couple
of receivers that can hang on to his
bullet-like shots.

Parrish, DeCamp, Brohard and
Mills have played their last game as
Seniors for the Wildcats, and how
they did it!

A big gap was made in the Cat back-
field when Walter Fraley went out on ac-
count of injuries.

In Brewer the Duke eleven pre-
sented one of the hardest-running
backs seen on Richardson field in a
long time; he just wouldn't stop.

As Dr, Lingle said, the Davidson field
general gave a wonderful exhibition of
Wildcat fight and daring when he
elected to take the offensive with the
game already “sewed up.” Probably too
much so.

One of the toughest breaks of the
game was early in the first quarter
when “Red” Parrish dropped Brock’s
perfect pass. It was a sure touchdown,
but the little Davidson half made up
for its loss and more. i

Monk and Tex can’t be praised too
highly for their work this season. A lot of
the spirit and fight of the Wildcats was
inspired by these two great mentors.

The season is over, but will never
be forgotten by those who witnessed
the Davidson eleven come through
time and time again with a great spirit
of determination and fight! Hats off
to Monk and Tex and their War-
riors!

APPLEBY GIVES TALK

(Continued from page 1)
Eighty-five per cent of all the. crimes
mitted in New York County last year
by boys under twenty-one years of age.

“These and other conditions show the great
need for the gospel of Jesus Christ. They are
a challenge to a big job and a great service.
Napoleon exiled on Elba asked one of his
companions the ‘Who is Jesus
Christ?) And when no answer was forth-
coming he replied, ‘Alexander was a gréat
man, a great military leader, and the founder
of a “magnificent empire. So were Julius
Caesar and Charlemagne, but their empires
were founded on force and crumbled away.
But Christ founded his on love and it will
remain forever.’ Julian, the Roman emperor
who was so cruel in persecuting the Chris-
tians, as he lay dying on the battlefield said,
‘O Galilean, Thou hast conquered.’

“But we can’t have a golden society among
men with leaden instincts. Here is the chal-
lenge again. Only the gospel of Christ can
change the minds and hearts of men.

“Then there is sheer joy in the ministry.
Many people think that the ministry is a
long faced gloomy profession, but it is really
one of the most cheerful callings there is.
There are many things that give it this satis-
faction. The great need, the bigness of the
task, the power of the message and the many
friendships formed in its all add to its joy.
It is a challenge to real red blooded men
to under take a job big in every sense of the
word.
