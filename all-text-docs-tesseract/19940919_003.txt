Computer Center updates to new campus-wide system’
Some_students unhappy about loss of some well-liked features

By Jeff Fuller

Returning students who
“logged in” to their computers for
the first time this year were sur-
prised to discover that their old
passwords no longer worked.
Computer Services installed anew
VAX system, entitled Pollux, to
replace the eight-year-old Apollo
system. As a result of this new
system, Internet e-mail addresses
changed as well. Mail sent to old
addresses will be forwarded.

Many students were bewil-
dered by the changes and won-
dered what had happened to the
old Apollo system. One student
expresses his dismay by suggest-
ing that the new Pollux system
sounds like “some kind of dis-
ease.”

Sophomore VAX user Tho-
mas Wang says, “I’m not frus-
trated, but I don’t see the point in
changing.” Wang adds that he
believes many other students do

not understand why these changes
took place.

Lydia Lorenzin, Coordinator
of Academic Facilities and Ser-
vice, explains the changes: “Six
years is a lifetime for computer.”
Last year, a decline in performance
was observed on Apollo, largely
due to the increasing number of
users and the inability of the sys-
tem to support the excessive use.
Sometimes it took as much as five
minutes to log into the system.

To remedy this problem
Lorenzin explains that two new
VAX systems were installed. One
system, called Castor, will be used
for statistics classes. The other,
Pollux, is for general use.

The new systems are 25 times
faster than Apollo. ‘We were
straining Apollo to its max be-
fore,” says Lorenzin.

Wang’s primary complaint
about the new system is the ab-
sence of a “send” command. This

was apopularcommand on the old
system which allowed students to
flash a quick message on others’
screens without sending a whole e-
mail message.

Due to complaints, Lorenzin
looked into getting the “send” com-
mand back; however, she says that

it would be a tremendous expense
for that one command.

Lorenzin explains that the in-
stallation of the “send” command
in Pollux would require new soft-
ware. The operating system was
changed from VMS to Open VMS

and the network operating system.

was changed from Pathworks 4.0
to Pathworks 5.

One computer help desk
attendent says, “From my point of
view as a help desk worker, it has
been a pain as well as a blessing ...
I think with any new computer
you’re going to have bugs.”

factors in their decision to attend
Davidson.

Sophomore Ann Hatfield re-
members that her interview was
extremely important to her. “The
interview shows that Davidson re-
ally cares about individuality and
that they have time for everyone.
’ I’m not sure if it affected my ad-

mission, but it was really influen-
tial to me.”

Prospective student Eric
Wittlake was disappointed to dis-
cover the new policy: “I feel like
an interview would increase my
chances of getting in.”

The Logistics of it all

Nancy Cable Wells, Dean of

” Admissions, says that interviews
for all applicants are not possible.
The amount of visitors has gone up

_ by 80%, but the size of the admis-

sions staff has not increased.

She also says that most visi-
tors come during the spring and
fall, the busiest times for counsel-
lors. In the fall they are traveling to
various high schools around the
world, and in the spring they are
overloaded with applications.

Why the changes?

Many colleges have converted

to this small information session

method. Cable Wells thinks that
interviews are not the best way to
evaluate students. Comparing the
interview process to the SAT, she
says that students often come in
nervous and don’t present them-
selves to their full potential.

In addition, many students
cannotafford to travel to Davidson.

who are unable to make it to the
campus.
Other Ways to get Acquainted
with Davidson

Leonard Satterwhite, Senior
Associate Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid, encourages
prospectives to get acquainted with
the school in other ways. “They

need to be out meeting faculty and
students instead of sitting inaroom
with an admissions counselor. We

- are trying to get the emphasis off

the interview. There are all sorts of
ways to get connected with
Davidson.”

Cable Wells cites student let-
ters, Discover Davidson, and alum-

nae interviews around the country
as other ways to become familiar
with the college.

Satterwhite says: “If astudent
feels a pressing reason to have an
individual conversation, then we
can accommodate that.” Cable
Wells agrees: “We won't tum
anybody away.” :
