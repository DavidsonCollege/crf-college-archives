Hogan's heavy machines turn out ‘peculiar things’

By TIM BETHEA
Staff Correspondent

In the early issues of Briar-
patch magazine there is a note
to contributors which reads:
‘‘We’re interested in articles on
regional writers (those with a
sense of time and place), and on
craftsmen who keep alive old
traditions and on preservation-
ists who save the past from
destruction and on local, paro-
chial, and even peculiar
things.”

It sounds like Briarpatch
Press owners Moreland and
Priscilla Hogan should really
publish articles about them-
selves and their press. Mr.
Hogan who is listed in Briar-
patch as ‘‘Editor & Great
Panjandrum,’’ and Mrs. Hogan
(Compositor & Corrector”) cer-
tainly qualify as craftsmen and
preservationists.

The Hogan’s operation may
be a ‘‘small press’’ as literary
parlance might have it, but the
press itself isn’t small. It has
machines, black machiries made
of heavy iron. They have
weight. You can see the jaws
and guts of these machines
because they are not covered in
plastic with red digital read-
outs.

No, these are the real things
— they do work. There’s a folder
there and a sewing machine and
a big press that looks like a
small fire engine (a bunch of
knobs and wheels and stuff to
fool with), and beneath it all
rumbles a rough energy: this is
the stuff that makes books. I
didn’t actually see any of it
work, but I doubt it’s all a
front; besides, the fruit of these
machines lies around the room
in heaps. Seeing may not be
believing but: dodging is and I
dodged a lot of books (all in
different stages of birth) as I
followed Mr. Hogan around.

“You have to like tinkering

and I come from a family of

tinkerers,’’ says Mr. Hogan
about the machines. ‘You can

learn how to run any one of
these machines in a few hours. I
spent twenty minutes in the
store learning how to run that
sewing machine from the fellow
who sold it to me.”’

The sewing machine was built
near the early part of this
century. It uses a series of
tooth-like spears called needles
which work in balance with the
rest of a mass of arms and gears
and screws to sew books to-
gether. It’s kind of mean loo-
king.

“I started working near prin-
ting in high school and then
more while at Davidson. If you
look in an old annual around
1964 you might see a picture
and an article about a wooden
press I built. Then I started
typesetting in 1972,” Mr. Ho-
gan says. He then did some
work for the University of
North Carolina Press and the
University of Georgia Press.
Gradually, Mr. and Mrs. Ho-
gan became more involved in
the publishing business. She
learned typesetting and he star-
ted designing books. They re-
turned to Davidson in 1976 and
bought the Mecklenburg Ga-
zette in 1977, which they pub-
lished until Good Friday, 1979.

“That was a good experience
because we got to know many of
the townspeople. We already
had friends at the College but
we didn’t w many folks in
town,” says Mr. Hogan. ‘‘And
it gave us a chance to learn a
little more about what we can
do. It became too much. We
were running flat out every
week and it really pushed us on
our other publishing obliga-
tions.”

The Briarpatch Ptess regu-
larly publishes the Davidson
Miscellahy, The Southern Poet-
ry Review, and The Southern

_Friend (also the Briarpatch, but

on a more irregular basis). The
aim of the press is not to rival
large commercial businesses or
provide a vanity service but to

offer alternative publishing to
serious, mostly non-commercial
regional writers. The press also
publishes specialty items (like
the town calendar) and other
“peculiar things.’’ Briarpatch
Press offers publishing oppor-
tunities for special, short-run
works, which may be scholarly,
literary or plain fun. While the
press can handle large works
(like Mary Beaty’s Davidson, A
History of the Town), it tends
toward smaller works because
they are easier to do. A sample
of the books which Briarpatch
has published include: Christ-
church, William Styron; Juda-
culla’s Handprint and Other
Mysterious Tales from North
Carolina, Julia Montgomery
Street; Register of St. Philip's

Church 1810-1822; Awakening .
to Music, Fred Chappell; Poca-
‘ hontas and the Drunken Wai- ~

ter, Gill Holland; and The
Village Green; Moreland Ho-
gan.

Briarpatch magazine has only.
just begun, with some design
changes yet to be made. The
first three issues vary in size,
shape and design but not in
purpose. Mr. Hogan says. he
wants to offer lcoal contributors
a chance to get into print,
delight subscribers and readers
and advertise the ideals of the
press. Briarpatch will soon be in
regular editions and welcomes
contributions of all sorts; Mr.

_Hogan says that if anyone can

write a better short story than
he can, chances are good that it
may make it into print. Past
issues have featured Anthony

Abbott, Mary Beaty, Benjamin |

C. Garrett, Moreland Hogan,
Gill Holland, Nancy McNair,
Barbara Winder, and J.S.
Winkler.

““How much does it take to
get into this?’ I asked: Mr.
Hogan says it doesn’t take too
much money but it does take
time and probably a willingness
to learn. He is only now getting
to the point where he and

Priscilla do nearly the whole
process. He’s building a dark-
room now so that he can deve-
lop his own negatives. ‘‘I desig-
ned this flexible binding which
was kind of fun to experiment
with, and it’s pretty neat bin-
ding.’’ There the sparks jump.
It’s clear that the Hogans are
not merely business people but
craftsmen. He is interested in
the printing processes of the
Elizabethans and enjoys work-
ing in that same traditon. He’s
not in it for money (’’No one’s
getting rich from this’’), so it
must be the joy of the medium.

In the September 1980 issue
of the Briarpatch, Frank

Anderson says in his ‘‘The

Moreland Hogan.

Private Printer’s Patch’’:

“These are books which have
been carefully printed and
bound and which bear the
stamp of the tender, loving care
of a human being rather than
the random hyphenation of a
computer. In some cases the
entire book, from concept to
finished product, is the handi-
work of one individual.”

By all outward signs, the
Hogans are independent people.
They work together hard and
long on a project of craft, of
saving the past from destruc-
tion. They create lasting, useful
and pleasing things and enjoy
doing it.
