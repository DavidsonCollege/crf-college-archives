Committee Tells

Of Policy Detgils

By SCOTT DAVIDSON
News Editor

Negro admissions, . recruit-
ing, and readmittanee after
leaving the college were
prime topigs of discussion in
the series of open meetings
of the Admissions Committee
held over the past week. A
final meeting is scheduled
for this morning.

Richard C. Burts Jr., Wil-
liam B. Hight, H. Edmunds

White, Jon W. Regen, An-
thony Abbott, Ralph W.
Gable, and L. R. King were
the committee members
present.

In, an opening statement

on Monday, Hight explained
the genéral policies~of the
Admissions Committee ~ in
evaluating an application. He
said that the application
forms were all assembled
into a.manila folder.

Each folder was then. in
dividually reviewed, by -sev-
eral conamittee members.

One of the initial questions
from the was whethér
the committee advocated a
policy of lowering standards
to permit admission of. mi-
nority group members. Ab-
hott said that standards were
not lowered for athletes,
alumni, blacks or anyone
else.

From the

floer

audience, David
Sweatt suggested a hypothet-
ical situation. He asked
whether a black student with
high boards but radical po
litical views mvould be dis
criminated . against.

Hight answered negative-
ly, saying that ’such a situ-
ation would require a look
at the total application.

The committee
tioned about the extent of
recruiting. Regen, said, ‘‘We
have been hindered by size
of our staff.” He explained
that they had been doing a
good job in the state, in
surrounding states, and in
major metropolitan areas.

Students then questioned

was .ques-

_ the committee an their policy

toward readmission of stu-
dents who had left the col-
lege in good academic stand-
ing. White said that it is
always possible to return to
the college. The only time
it was not guaranteed ‘was
in the fall term because they
always reached .their high-
est enrollment at this time.

Backs
Boycott

By GEORGE KANEKLIDES
Staff Writer

Although the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee refused
to act on the matter, the

SGA’ Senate Wednesday
night passed a r®€Solution en-
dorsing a natidénwide student
boycott of classes on Thurs-
day to protest the invasion
of Cambodia. é

Boycott organizer Peter
Hobbie asked for Senate en
dorsement ,of the class boy
cott

Cecil Burney, who made
the formal motion for adop-
tion, pointed out that_a stu
dent strike njight conflict
with the college administra-
tion’s dissent policy.

That policy states that
“immediate suspension”
would be justified for any
student who disrupts the
“normal processes or activi-
ties of the college.”

A final vote on the boycott

endorsement showed nine
senators in favor with three
opposed. i

Those in favor were Bur-

ney, Roger Mills, Al Norris,
Danny Clodfelter, Bill Alex-
ander, Charley Ralston, Don
Bailey, Jim*tUpchurch, and
Chip Price.

son College campus saw a
week of protest against the
invasion of Cambodia by
armed American ,troops and
the massacre of students by
Ohio National Guardsmen at
Kent State University.

There were many groups
staging demonstrations, hold-
ing vigils and memorial ser-

¥ices probably involving
about half of the student
body.

Three professors conducted
# peace vigil in front of the
Davidson Post Office from
Wednesday morning through
Friday night, collecting sig-
natures. for a telegram to
President Nixon and distrit»
uting information on the war.

WHERE NOT TO CATCH YOUR FISH. .
Rocky River water proved fatal to several silver minnows.

‘Environment Tuesday’ Features
Galifianakis, Panel, Fish-Killing

By STEVE CROSS
Copy Editor

The Davidson ECOS, in an
effort to bring the pollution
problem to the public eye
in a dramatic way, poisoned
some fish in a tank on the
Union porch of ‘Environ-
ment Day” Tuesday morning.

Minnows were placed in a
tank of ‘water from the
Rocky River, which many
older people in the Davidson
community can remember
swimming in. The water was
a dark green murky color.

Asistant professor of Biolo-
gy David G. Grant explained
that there is no life in Rocky
River except ‘‘bacteria by the
gross ton.”

The ECOS also brought to
the campus as a featured
speaker Fourth District Rep-

resentative Nick Galifianak- .

is of Durham, who spoke in
fhe Mofrison Room at 10
a.m. ~

Galifianakis, joking that
‘after 3000 years we Greeks

are fashionable again,” said
that the solution to the pol-
lution problem was people—
especially young people or-
ganizing to do something
about it.

Galifianakis said that the
only pollution problem, to be
solved in the streets is pick-
ing up litter, and doubted
that many revolutionaries
would ‘‘stoop to conquer.”

Unfortunately, he added,
people, as well as being the
solution, are also the prob-
lem. He cited the survey of
students at Cornell University
which showed that while 84
percent felt the size of fam-
ilies should be limited, . 65
percent also wanted to have
more than two children.

During the question-and-
answer period, Galifianakis
expressed the hope that the

population probleni could be
solved, without too much
government intervention, -‘‘I
want to keep the government
out of the bedroom,” he’ said.

He also eneouraged the
audience to write their Con-
gressmen. ‘You'd be ‘sur-
prised,” he assured ‘the au-
dience, ‘how: much a letter
from a constituent can do.”

“Environment Day" activi-
ties continued with a panel
discussion on pollution in
Charlotte. There were some
analyses of the problem and
some novel suggestions for
solving it. ~

Assistant Professor of Eco-
nomics Robert L. . Avinger
said the problem was basic-
ally an economic one. Air
and water, he said, are be-
coming ‘‘rare resources,” yet
people use them as if they
were free.

He theorized that the costs
of driving a car or pollut-
ing rivers are higher to the
society than to the individual
polluter.

Therefore, he said, people
should be--made to .pay for
the right to pollute resources.

A tax on gas-eating cars,

for example, would stimu-
late industry to make clean-
er engines or refine better
gasoline, he said.

The panel's only represent-
ative from industry, Frank
Dowd, president of Charlotte
Pipe and Foundry Co., re-
ported that his business has
installed anti-pollution § de-
vices which are largely ef-
fective.

The half-million dollar
equipment pulls: fly-ash and
grease from thick foundry
smoke. Dowd said the com-
pany bore the cost for this
equipment without raising
prices or cutting wages,

Mecklenburg County Com-
missioner Dr, James G.
Martin said the -county is
looking for space to build
landfill stations for garbage
disposal.

The’ problem, he ‘said, is,
not in*getting people’ to com- .

ply with-landfill- ordinances,
but in finding places’ to put
garbage dumps.

The students were protest-
ing the invasion of Cambodia
and the massacre of students
by National Guardsmen at
Kent State University in Ohio.

The demonstration was vir-
tually unorganized, but» be
gan when a small group de
cided at lunchtime that some
public protest was in order.

About 70. students Held a
sit-in at the ROTC head
quarters right before drill
was supposed to start.

ROTC cadre officers ap-
peared to be non-plussed by
the whole affair. They step-
ped over and around the
bodies sprawled in the hall-
way, usually asking if every-
one was comfortable.

One student said that the
reason students were demon
strating at the ROTC head
quarters was to — confront
people with the fact that
ROTC was the place wher
stadents learned to kill fol,
lowing orders froin military
superiors.

There were chants — of

“Pulb out of Indochina” and

“Pull out of Ohio.”
brought

Someone along a

kazoo, so they played and
whistled the Marine Hymn
and other patriotic songs.

When drill started, the
group marched to the drill
field,

About ~30 -students joined

them along the way, bringing
their number to about 100.
Demonstrators often remark-
ed that although there was
no publicity for the demon-
stration, it drew 10 percent
of the student body.

Once .at the drill field, the
protestors did not break in-
to the ranks of the ROTC
troops, but stood on a hill

* overlooking the field, shout-

ing at indivfduals to leave
the drill and join the demon-
stration.

A quick headcount showed
there were as many protest-
ers as there were non-officer-
rank students drilling.

Tuesday’s ROTC drill Was
not a regular uniform. drill,
but an exercise in pysical
training. When the ROTC
troops fell in at the football
field, the demonstrators be-
gan to march around the
track which circles the grid-
iron.

When the protestors reach-
ed the far end of the field,
cadre officers gave the order
to fall out, and the ROTC
troops filed out of the other
the field, cutting
short the drill. ‘

Although it is. not general
practice to lock the doors
after drill, it was done be-
“cause, Col. Foster Said,

“There was no need of having
outsiders in the department
due to the situation today.”

The demonstrators took up
positions at each of the four
entrances to the ROTC of-
fices, but were refused en-
trance.

There was one dramatic
encounter when students
tried to gain entry with Maj.
Frederick Brigham, who had
been locked out.

One student held the door
for Brigham and then asked
to be admitted. He said, ‘No,

this is a place of business,”
and tried to block the door
way

The student holding the
door asked if the officers
thought ‘they were “under
seige.” Then the major reach
ed for the door handle, jerk
ed and slammed the door
slit in the students’ faces.

Col. Foster later explained
that ROTC troops would be
using practice grenades that
day, and he did not feel it
wise ‘to involve protestors in

“Violence is a symptom of

dent violence? It is law and

They were Southeast Asian

professor David Kaylor and
a former executive assistant
to Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, William Jackson.

The three professors ‘were
joined by students who set
up picket lines in front of
the post office after they
obtained a permit to parade
from the town of Davidson.

The permit gave them the
right to have ten people
marching at a time on the
sidewalk in front of the post
office, according to Peter
Hobbie, who obtained the per-
mit from the town.

Gaige organized’ a group
of students who took the tele-
gram to Nixon door-to-door
in the town of Davidson. They
gathered 129 signatures there
in about two hours, and also
received commitments from
several black people to
march in the picket lines
with students Thursday and
Friday. .|

As of press time some 700
signatures had been attached
to the telegram, including
that of College President
Sameul R. Spencer Jr., stu-
dents and townspeople.

In a letter to the college
community Spencer said he
is opposed to the invasion
of Cambodia and ‘appalled

atid senatorial campaigns.

“One thing students can do
is ring doorbells,”” he said.
“After, all, any  man—will
leave his television if a
pretty girl is at the door!”

According to Wald, the
threat of nuclear warfare
and the population explosion
are the two~-most pressing
problems of today.

The Harvard Professor em-
phasized thate no one can
win a nuclear war. But when
asked what his solution to
this problem was, he said,
“I'nf® afraid you're going to
have to find yourself another
administration,”

Wald noted that at-present
there are nuclear warheads
equivalent to 15 tons of TNT
for every man, woman, and
child in the world. ‘I think
that’s enough,” he replied.

In relation to this idea,
the Nobel Prize winner said
he couldn't resist ‘quoting
Georgia Senator Richard
Russell’s statement that if
we have to get back to
Adam and Eve, I want them
to.be Amercians.

Concerning the population
problem, Wald said that man
is the first living organism
threatened~ by—-his-own~re-
production: **Most authorities
expect a doubling of popir

lation and famine by the end
of the century,” he said.

Wald’s solution is to make
contraceptives available free
for every woman in the
world. He also favored abor-
tions saying that ‘‘No woman
should have to bear an un-
wanted child.”

Establishing the relation
between science and «current
social issues, Wald said,

“Science attempts to under-
stand all reality. One, can
gain, knowledge from books,
but wisdom onty' from. things.
That is what science is, It
extracts wisdom from

things.”

Wald thus concluded that
science is ‘‘altégether good,”

but it -is technology that
should be under constant
review. ‘‘Know all you can,”
he said, ‘‘but do only those
things -which are socially
useful.

Wald ended his speech by
quoting Deuteronomy from
which he extracted his speech
title, “Therefore Choose
Life.”

“I call heaven and earth
to witness against you this
day, that I have set you be-

fore -ifé and. death, blessing
“and ¢tirse;-therefore—¢hoose

“life “that you and your de-

scendants may. live.”
