After several frustrating days
of answering machines, eager as-
sistants, and roaming publicity
managers, I finally found myself at
the business end of a phone line
staring down Rob Bonaccorsi.

Some may wonder why any-
one would go to such lengths to
talk to Bonaccorsi, and until I suc-
ceeded, I was among them. He is,
in fact, one of three guitarists for
the Freddy Jones Band, which has
just recently released their second
major label album, North Ave.
Wake Up Call. They also played
alongside Joan Osborne and Wide-
spread Panic yesterday: at the
Blockbuster Pavilion in Charlotte.

In talking with Bonaccorsi I
learned that the band has been to-
gether for four years with their
current line up. Everything started
when Marty Lloyd (acoustic gui-
tar, vocals) met Wayne Healy (gui-
tar, vocals) in college and later
hooked up with Jim Bonaccorsi
(bass) and Simon Horrocks
(drums). Bonaccorsi completed
the group by replacing a
keyboardist who left the bandearly.

The five started out by play-
ing the bar scene on Chicago’s
north side and eventually began to

venture out.. They. released an in-...

dependent album, and while pre-

The Freddy Jones Band.

paring to enter the studio for a
second, Capricorn Records ap-
proached them looking for a band
ready to record. FJB fit the bill,
and in the fall of 1993 Waiting for
the Night was released.

In an attempt to support their
album, the band launched a tour
that stretched from fall into winter
and along 250 days with a month
break.

The band opened for such
groups as Big Head Todd and the
Monsters as well as Widespread
Panic.

_ I was curious to hear how ev-
eryone got along after driving
across.most of the country, in such
close quarters. Bonaccorsi said

that for the most part things went
well. “We’ ve got to get up on stage
and look at one another and try to
have the time of our lives every
night.”

He was excited to hook up

with Widespread again for

Sunday’s show. “We were out
with them for two and a half
months. We were like one big
family so we’ ve kept in close con-
tact,” he said. 3

Bonaccorsi described the tour-
ing schedule as “sleep, get up,
soundcheck, play, go back tosleep”
but says he loves it regardless:
“It’s a privilege to be able to be on

the..road. and. play..every.-single
night.”

Asked about how songs were
written and fleshed out, Bonaccorsi
had a lot to say. “There’s no real
formula. It kind of evolves and
manifests itself in different forms.”
Sometimes someone will presenta
song sketch, music, or just lyrics
and the band makes it their own.

The five spent three months
rehearsing before recording the
current album for which their pro-
ducer, Justin Niebank, occasion-
ally flew up from Nashville.

In the studio the songs were
recorded from rehearsed founda-
tions up to the finest details.

He said the work is a collabo-
rative effort where everyone is open
to suggestions. “The guys in-the

band are very supportive.”

What emerged from this in-
volved process was a very tight
album. The songs on North Ave.
Wake Up Call are well structured,
and the musicianship is excellent.

What didn’t emerge was any
form of progressive sound. The
backbone of the Freddy Jones Band
is classic blues rock with a sprinkle
of the college sound to tie it to-
gether.

The songs on the whole are of
the same flavor and tone, varying
little in their delivery and gim-
micks.

For the most part, this is an
album for. those. interested in the
traditional with a few twists.
