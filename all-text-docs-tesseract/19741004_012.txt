In memory of Dave ‘“Tucson

Nebraska, the  Rincoon
Rangers. were formed, but
Dave would be displeased with
their first result.

The SPE’s beat the Rangers
24-7, and once again proved
that they rank as the dog dung

on campus. Not even Stinky

will go near ’em.
These guys had their usual
*battalion of SPE’s and leading
24-0 they faked a kick-off to
draw the foolish Rangers of-
fsides. Guess they are going
for the sportsmanship trophy
along with winning their own
athletic point trophy.

In a biggie, SAE won an ex-

With the addition of
Joseph T. Gardner to the’
Theatre Arts department,
Professor of Drama Rupert
T. Barber is optimistic
about this year’s drama
plans.

Garnder will serve as
technical director for the
year’s first major produc-
\ tion, Carlo Goldoni’s ‘‘The
? Servant of Two Masters,”
) an 18th-century comedy in
‘ the style of the classic com-
media dell’ arte.

This entertaining con-
fusion of plots and cross-
plots will be presented in
an 18th-century festive at-
" mosphere. ‘‘We will try to
create an environment of a

s. carnival day,’’ Barber ex-
N plained. Performances will
'® be’ given Oct. 31 through
s Nov. 2.

% Barber emphasized the
} importance of one major
® production each term. This

this year, with Gardner

have to tighten up their ‘‘d’’ if
they are to defend their title.

Look for the Cleveland In-
dians to be tough once again
with the addition of Randy
‘*Football’’ Thomson. as
rusher and Kevin ‘“‘the jack

their already tough returning
lineup.

Next week more IMAC,

So, as Beachball bounces off

with this pearl of advice from

If you’re down, cheat your
way ahead, and then change
your underwear. That made

Plans

giving students a little
more opportunity to par-
ticipate in drama,” Barber
said. ‘

Workshops are planned
throughout the winter and
spring terms and will
feature several student- }
written and directed plays.

These plans, in addition §
to the rumored -spring
musical, will depend on
student interest and talent. .
Barber asked that all

department.
