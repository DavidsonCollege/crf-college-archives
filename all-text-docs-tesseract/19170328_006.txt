“moral code,” we should certainly re-
quire that clear, convincing evidence of
a man’s guilt along this or any other line
be given before any action is taken.

The question of revising the code
should be decided this year and by the
whole student body. Personally, I be-
lieve that the drinking question is the
least ground we have for making such
a revision. We put into the constitution
this year an all-inclusive hazing rule—
a rule specific and definite as to what
constituted hazing and what constituted
provoking hazing. But this rule, as far
as its original purpose was concerned,
has proven an absolute failure. It has
been broken continually as to the letter
of the law, and I venture to say that it
has been broken at least unintentionally
by every man in the student body, Stu-
dent Council not excepted. I do not
mean that there has been any amount of
real hazing, but who of us has not heard
“jibing” on the part of some Freshman?

We must remember, however, that
the student body passed this rule. As a
member of the student body 1 feel that
we have all fallen short of our duty in
upholding and supporting the honor sys-
tem. I also think that much of the
blame can be traced to the constitution,
but not by any means all of it. We as
individuals in the student body haven't
given the question due thought and con-
sideration. What we need is an honor
system in which every one will feel his
personal responsibility. Working toward
this end we should make the best of
things as they are. The best and only
way we can bring about this condition,
in my opinion, is to revise our constitu-
tion and in doing this let every man in
the student body take part in its revision.
Let all sides of the question be brought
up so that everybody can understand
fully the action that is taken. I believe
that student body meetings are the places
for this discussion to be made. [very
man should make it a personal matter to
strive for a constitution in which we all,
as thoughtful men, are bound up irre-
vocably to maintain and support and
nourish for future college generations.
‘This question should be decided by the
student body and decided this year.

‘This is an age of reformation. Since
the beginning of the twentieth century
radical reforms have been sweeping this
country. In some places they have taken
the shape of political and social reforms
while in others they have been religious
and moral changes. It is impossible
that this movement should sweep over
Davidson College without leaving its in-
delible stamp upon the campus life.
Lately, marked steps have been taken in
changing the morals of the campus for
the better. Up to the past year this
good work was carried out by the stu-
dents in personal interviews and other
honorable ways. ‘The changes them-
selves are a proof of the value and worth
of this system of moral reform. During
the past year, however, it seems that on
account of a few moral fanatics on the
campus that this method of reform has
received «a severe setback, the result of
which is at present the foremost topic
of discussion among the students. ‘These
extremists seem capable of looking only
upon one side of the question. “They
are eager to find the baseness and evil
in an offense but are equally unwilling
to sympathize with or aid the “transgres-
sor who perhaps is fighting a great temp-
tation. In their superficial and over-
vealous morality they have stood off in
a Pharisaic attitude and have employed
means of obtaining evidence which are
beneath the dignity of a student of Dav-
idson College.

Of course such a prominent body as
the Student Council. could hardly hope
to escape this movement. The old idea
of this council has changed to a new one.
While in former years it was supposed

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, March 28, 1917

to consider only those affairs relating to
the welfare of the student body, the
new idea is that it should investigate the
personal life of each student and, if need
be, to amend it to conform with their
own ideas. We believe that this dis-
satisfaction which has been manifesting
itself over the campus is not caused by
an inadequate governing body—as some
have implied—but by lack of knowledge
as to the purpose of this body. Its laws
and decrees, with certain amendments,
have stood ever since the system was
first introduced into Davidson College.
As the college has enlarged to over twice
its natural size, these laws must neces-
sarily be altered to suit the greater num-
ber of students. While we believe that
they should be made more definite as re-
gards certain offenses, we do not believe
that they should bear the characteristics
of a narrow minded hypocrisy. L.
