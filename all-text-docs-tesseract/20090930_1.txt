On Tuesday, Sep. 22, town of-
ficials received word that Davidson
has been accepted into the North
Carolina Main Street program.

According to the North Caro-
lina Main Street Center, the pro-
gram “helps small towns to rec-
ognize and preserve their historic
fabric” by utilizing local resources
to “build on their unique character-
istics to create vibrant central busi-
ness districts that meet the needs of
today’s communities.”

Developed by the National
Trust for Historic Preservation, the
program offers funding for the re-
newal of small town main streets
and has proven successful in over
a thousand smaller communities
across the United States.

Since the establishment of the
program in 1980, North Carolina
Main Street downtowns have ex-
perienced a gain of $1.1 billion
in new investments, a net gain of
13,000 jobs, a net gain of 3,100
businesses and the renovation of
3,000 buildings. Nationwide, Main
Street communities have received
more than $41.6 billion of new
public and private investment in
their downtowns.

The Main Street program uti-
lizes a four-point approach to im-
plement its objective of downtown
redevelopment and revitalization:
organization, promotion, design,
and economic restructuring in cen-
tral business districts.

Building partnerships between
diverse groups including mer-
chants, bankers, public officials,
civic groups and the chamber of
commerce promotes effective man-

agement and downtown leadership.
The program aims to restore down-
town areas as attractions for shop-
pers, investors and tourists by im-
proving retail merchandising and
rejuvenating community involve-
ment.

The four-point approach also
includes enhancing the aesthetic
quality of the downtown area with
attention to environmental elements
and public improvements.

Finally, the program seeks to
diversify the economic base of the
community while maintaining and
strengthening the existing econom-
ic assets of the business district.

The town of Davidson hopes to
benefit from the program guidance,
technical assistance, training, net-
working, advocacy and leadership
that the North Carolina Main Street
Center offers. Over the past year,
Davidson has been devising a new
comprehensive plan for the rede-
velopment of the downtown area.

Beginning with a restructuring
that shifted the director of the non-
profit Downtown Davidson Inc.
(DDI) to a department head posi-
tion in Town Hall, town officials
have been seeking to improve the
local business climate.

Although brokers consider Da-
vidson a great place to live, it is not

‘often considered as an ideal place

to locate their businesses. A non-
scientific survey of local residents
uncovered that most Davidson resi-
dents consider the town indifferent
to business here.

For this reason, Davidson has
hired the consulting firm Arnett
Muldrow & Associates of Green-
ville, SC to develop a branding and
marketing plan that will promote
downtown Davidson.

Vann Center expands with new programs

KELLy WILSON

The study of ethics on campus
moves to a higher plane this year
with the opening of the Vann Cen-
ter for Ethics and the attendance of
four seniors at the Symposium on
Ethical Decision-Making and Mor-
al Values to be held at Hilton Head
in November.

The Vann Center for Ethics
serves as “a catalyst for moral in-
quiry, interdisciplinary reflection,
civil dialogue, careful analysis and
responsible action regarding eth-
ics,” said Dr. David Perry, Profes-
sor of Applied Ethics and Director
of the Vann Center for Ethics.

Jim Vann °50 and his wife Lee
donated a major gift to the College
to establish an ethics center about

two years ago. College President
Tom Ross established an advisory
committee to develop the Center’s
mission, which was adopted last
May, and Perry was recruited to be-
come the Center’s Director.

“Davidson’s campus has al-
ways been infused with honor and
ethics,” Perry said. “One of the rea-
sons folks were attracted to found-
ing the Center this year is that this
is the centennial year of the student-
run honor system. Later this fall we
will host a panel discussion about
the Davidsonian tradition of honor
and integrity.”

The Vann Center is housed on
the first floor of Eumenean Hall and
partners with a variety of organiza-
tions on campus to brainstorm ethi-
cal issues that people are interested
in discussing. The Center hosts

events such as lectures and open
discussions about ethical issues.

There have already been three
events this fall that were well at-
tended by students including the
presentation “Physicians’ Integrity
and Ties to Industry,” given by Dr.
Lance Stell, Davidson’s Thatcher
Professor of Philosophy and Di-
rector of the Medical Humanities
Program, and Perry’s own lecture
entitled “Ethics and War in Com-
parative Religious Perspective.”

Funding for the Vann Center
also allows for two additional eth-
ics courses to be offered each year,
both taught by Perry.

“The Vann Center emphasizes
Davidson’s approach to facilitating
well-rounded growth in all David-
son students,” said Athan Makansi
10, Chair of the Honor Council

and Member of the Vann Center’s
Advisory Board. “It encourages
students to grapple with questions
of conduct. These questions are
just as important as questions of
academia that we all encounter in
the classroom.”

While many organizations on
campus already inform the cur-
rent ethical climate on campus,
the Vann Center focuses on ethi-
cal deliberation across disciplines,
and it provides venues for dialogue
around ethics.

The Vann Center currently is
establishing a Student Advisory
Group, which will evaluate the
Center’s events, help plan future
programs and moderate discus-
sions. The group will meet once a
