THE DavIDSONIAN

By Caro ine HAUSER

One by one, most of last week’s sporting
events were either cancelled or postponed as
news broke of the four terrorist hijackings
and subsequent attacks on New York City
and Washington, D.C.

On Thursday, Sept. 13, the Southern Con-
ference cancelled all games through Sunday,
Sept. 16. “The Southern Conference wishes
to join with the rest of the nation’s major
athletic conferences and organizations in
showing its expression of sorrow for the
victims and families of this week’s national
tragedy,” said Interim Commissioner Geoff
Cabe. “We continue to believe that it is nec-
essary for the nation to return to a sense of
normalcy as quickly as possible. However,
judging by sentiments being expressed around
the nation today, it is obvious that moment is
not at hand.”

play fair, but no matter, for my team will
win because it stands resolute and as one.

“Once more unto the breach, dear
friends, once more.”

Back in reality, I understand that not
everyone feels the hurt and loss. I vividly
remember a girl asking me why I looked so
sad on Tuesday morning, and when I asked
her if she’d seen the news her response
was, “Oh, yeah, but you know, it doesn’t
really affect me that much. I don’t know.”

And I know not everyone feels the pa-
triotism—not xenophobia— induced by the

assault on our homeland. I guess that un-
derstanding hit me when I read the words
“is responsible” scrawled under the let-
ters, “U.S.A.” I had written on my
whiteboard.

This week we’re all going on with our
lives; athletic competition resumes, school-
work never stopped, and vigils and prayer
services cease until the next tragedy. I
guess we’re to draw from all this that the
sun will indeed rise tomorrow. I don’t
know—all I want is the t.v. cameras off my
campus.
