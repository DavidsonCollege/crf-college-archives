Davidson Returns to
The Southern Conference ‘

By Tom Koonce

In aunanimous vote last May,
the Southern Conference Execu-
tive Committee agreed to admit
Davidson as the league’s tenth
member,

The move to get Davidson
back into the Southern Conference
began last fall, when the league
first presented the idea to the col-
lege.

Davidson did notimmediately
jump back into the conference.
According to Athletic Director
Terry Holland, ‘We dragged our
feet around for awhile to see what
was best for Davidson.”

Davidson was amember of the
Southern Conference from 1936
until 1988. After a few years of
competing as an independent,
Davidson joined the Big South
Conference for the 1990-91 sea-
son.

Holland commented on the fact

that Davidson was happy with the
Big South Conference and was not
looking for another league, but the
approach by the Southern Confer-
ence was something that the col-
lege couldn’t ignore.

Holland added, “Our focus
rightnowisstillon the Big South.”
Davidson will compete in the Big
South this season and begin play in
the Southern Conference in 1992-
93.

'Theideaof rejoining the South-
ern Conference was approved by
the Davidson board of trustees in
May. It was an idea that was looked
at from several different angles.
Holland said that it was finally
decided that the Southern Confer-
ence was not inconsistent with
Davidson’s concept of athletics.

In joining this league,
Davidson must begin a women’s
basketball program. While Hol-
land was apprehensive about this

when he firstcame to Davidson, he
now believes that women’s bas-
ketball is a natural next step for the
college. He added that such a
program would probably have been
pursued regardless of what confer-
ence Davidson joined.

Injoining the league, Davidson
still plans to compete at the Divi-
sion III level in football. This does
presenta problem withthe NCAA,
but this issue will not be addressed
until the NCAA convention next
winter.

The Southern... Conference
members are Appalachian State,
Furman, The Citadel, East Ten-
nessee State, Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga, Virginia Military Insti-
tute, Western Carolina, and
Marshall. Davidson and Georgia
Southern are the two new mem-
bers. Georgia Southern will also
begin competition in 1992-93.
