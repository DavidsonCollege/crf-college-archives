What's Happening at Davidson?

Something is wrong. In recent
weeks and months, I, along with
every other sentient creature on
thiscampus, have noticed that there
is a tremendous feeling of disen-
franchisement on the part of many
students. Friends who are juniors
and seniors seem always to ques-
tion exactly what became of the
Davidson we knew two years ago.
Iam not being overly dramatic, nor
do I subscribe to any revisionist
theory of memories, where every-
thing where everything was better
way back when. The facts are
simple. Davidson students are not
as happy in their lives here as they
ought to be. Controversies seem to
spring up weekly, and they are
often founded in gross misunder-
standing. Students here are failing
at achieving a state of peaceful
coexistence, and it’s everyone’s
fault. So what is to be done to ease
campus tensions?

1) Last week, a women’s eat-
ing house voted to pull funding of
a fraternity’s social doings on the
grounds that the house was, in
essence, offensive in principle and
practice. That would be fine, ex-
cept that if a martian were handed
the list of grievances, it would be
hard-pressed to figure out which
house was being censored. Sadly,
all of the houses, at one time or
another this year, have posted flyers
or sold t-shirts thatcould be deemed
inappropriate. Unfortunately,
fights are an equal opportunity
disturber, they occur at all houses,
both men’s and women’s. And
finally, if every house is to be
punished for the wrong-doing of
one or two of its members, then we
may as well tear down Patterson
Court, pave it, and improve the
parking situation (I have a feeling
Dean Terry. would pay for this out

of his own pocket) . If an organi- °

‘zation desires to “clean up” the
Court, it most certainly shouid be
done unilaterally.

2) On Thursday, a professor
irresponsibly allowed a mob to
form outside the commons, in
protest of the aforementioned fra-
ternity. Beforehand, he circulated

a letter, on Davidson College sta-
tionary, calling for action from the
Board of Trustees. Stunningly, the
professor presented no evidence

Andrew
Spainhour

per his accusations. He, too, it
seems, would like to punish an
entire house because of the actions
of no more than three of its mem-
bers, who acted as individuals and
not as flag bearers for a larger or-
ganization.

My chronicling these events
should, inno way, be misconstrued.
My aim is not to champion the
downtrodden Patterson Court,
though I obviously have strong
feelings in these matters. I think
these occurrences are endemic ofa
larger trend. Irrationality seems to
rule out every action, and the
complexities of campus wide mis-
understandings have only added
fuel to the fire. We have experi-
enced a school year marred by a
lack of communication and under-
standing, and clearly the commu-
nity is suffering. The larger ques-
tion is, what has produced the irra-
tionality of late? I have a few
ideas:

1) Students are burned out.

‘Fifteen week semesters, heavy

work loads, and worries about
grades leave people frazzled.
While thisis commonplace atevery

‘do know this:

school, when it is coupled with
tensions in the surrounding envi-
rons, it can prove devastating to
an individual’s morale.

2) Some students fail to re-
spect the feelings of other students.
A few manners on everyone’s part
goalong way, and yet, there seems
to be an unwillingness to embrace
this concept because a) I didn’t
start it, or b) it was a joke, or c) the
other person is sexist, or racist, or
homophobic . . .why should I be
nice?

3) Students have no viable
spiritual outlet. DCPC simply fails

to address the concerns of college-

age people, leaving students feel-
ing empty and hollow when faced
with troubles.

4) Students feel the admini-
stration is unresponsive to their
concerns. The minus grades con-
troversy and the shortened exam
schedule mess, for right or wrong,
have created a tremendous amount
of bitterness.

5)Somestudents feel they can’t
fitintothe established social mores.
I was told asa freshman that every-
onecould findanicheat Davidson,
given time. I have no idea if this is
really true, yet it is conceivable.
Perhaps people feel that everyone
should fit in everywhere. I tend to
think that everyone should be able
to feel comfortable everywhere,
but friends, at Davidson, as in the
real world, we simply can’texpect
to be embraced by all whom we
meet. There are places here I don’t
feel athome, butI don’t feel disen-.

franchised. I just go elsewhere. ~

I do not pretend to think that
I’ve gotten this mess figured out. I
We all need to
acknowledge, but not be ruled by,
our differences. We must realize
that we cannot all enjoy ‘“‘same-
ness,” nor would wereally want to.
We need to start anew, in order to
salvage our sense of community.

And most importantly, we need to .

move on. Campus unhappiness
and intolerance are tired old
themes.

Rude Notes and Random Scribblings

Rocks & Vials Across Davidson

By Chris Frampton

Almost every column this is-
sue refers to a letter written by a
man whose name reminds me of
the worst part of freshman year.
All but a lucky few dorks had to
suffer through those hour long
sessions of finger snapping and
alphabet recitations and I still have
nightmares. But I digress. (Sur-
prise.) ;

This week’s Opinions section
is an interesting one because of all
the events of the past week. At
least one of the other columns
suggests a solution to what has
been deemed “intolerance.” Ihave
asuggestion as well. The problem

at Davidson is strange. Although
many other schools have had to
deal with aspects of intolerance
and a lack of community respect
their difficulties lay elsewhere. Our
Situation is based on a need for
change. Here at Davidson we have
been drinking beer and bourbon
and other alcoholic beverages for
many years. Certainly, this is no
different from the rest of the higher
education institutions around the
country, but they have to break
rules to do it. We are doing noth-
ing rebellious when we carry a
twelve pack across the court and
that is the problem.

Davidson needs a rallying
point. We need to focus our ener-

gies on something people really
hate. The factis, people really like
alcohol and they don’t. actually
mind our habit. Here is my sug-
gestion: we should all begin to
smoke crack.

The administration would not
stand for it nor would the authori-
ties. We would havea great time if
we could all rally against a com-
mon enemy: conservatives. I am
not asking’ you to change your
political beliefs, I’m just asking
you to save your college while you
expand your mind. We obviously
haven’t been able to find a com-
mon ground ineducation, commu-
nity service, or friendship; let’s

Depth! Relevance!

Who's Sheltered?

“I have travelled extensively--in
Concord” (Thoreau, more or less).

She was young and behind the
Snickers and I set one on the
counter. “I love those things,” she
said, and her fingers tapped out a
pish pish crick on the keys of the
register. Little plastic numbers
popped up to show what I owed.

“Me too.”

“Gettin’ gas?”

“No.”

“Anything else?”

“No.”

But I was lost.

It’s easy to do.

You peek down Concord Road
and you See all those fields. Some
have cows in’ them--cows that
munch tranquilly whileacomputer
blinks and gulps some final draft.
Ah, wilderness. And you peek a
little further, maybe from the win-

dow of a car, and there’s more -

fields. Big ones. And great big
cows. And woods and woods and
woods.

Well, actually, somewhere
between “woods” and “woods”
there’s always some small town.
But wildness beckons and you turn-
again and again. Townturntown-
turn. ,

And you notice that the roads
round Davidson fan out east and
south, etc, and criss-cross a lot and
convolute and sometimes, you’d
swear it, fade away with the reflex-
ion in your rear-view mirror--
around the corner and gone.

All of a sudden you can only
trace back three turns out of five
towns, and you turn four times and
you're lost. The fields start getting
really big, and the cows gigantic.
You roll up the windows because
it’s cooling. But you’re safe. You
know it’s coming. There’s got to
be another town--and a gas station.

At least, that’s what I was
counting on. While out blazing
short cuts somewhere between

Davidson and I-85 north, I had —

encountered navigational turbu-
lence. But fortunately in America
a mystical connection exists be-
tween the sellers of gasoline and
point A and point B. Solsawasign
for Concord and set my nose for
fumes.

Concord, NC really isn’t that
small of a small town, and it isn’t
all that far away from things. But
this gas station was small--tiny--
with clunky pumps, aloose-hinged
brown door and the girl behind the
Snickers.

There was motor-oil in the
store, and cigarettes. There were

some food stuffs. Bread, canned:

goods, etc. Sardines. In my mind
the girl didn’t seem to fit in. Her
brown hair,loose ‘and collegiate
around her shoulders, didn’t say to

me, “I work here. This is my job?’

She was about my age’and that
seemed to be the end of it.

“NO, just the Snickers.”

Crick crick.

Grunting mechanically, the
machine spat my change out the
side on down a shoot into a well-
worn metal trough:

“Oh, and can you tell me how
to get back to Davidson from here?”

She couldn’t quite place the
name.

Davidson College community that accepts everyone. Where people do
not have to think twice about what they look like, how they feel or what
they think. A place where human dignity and therefore feelings of others

come naturally to everyone.

Where do we start? With ourselves. When Bernice King spoke last

month she told the story of two groups of peoplein paradise. Both groups
had feasts laid out before them and six foot silverware for eating. One

group was sad and starving because each individual was trying to feed

him/herself. The other group was happy, content and full because
individuals were feeding each other across the table. This campus is
Starving rightnow. A lotof good people are trying to work through these
problems, but it requires effort from everyone. Openness, respect, sen-
sitivity and introspection are needed right now -- not accusations.
Students must look at their own behavior and wonder if they are embody-
ing what they expect of others. ‘Students must themselves makean effort
to try new ways of discussing and socializing. Studentsneed to continue
their calls for administration help, and we need to be vigilant in seeing
that things change, but we need stand up and change some things
ourselves. We must all go out of our way to accomodate other view-
points, cultures and ideas and lead Davidson out of the Qld South and

into the New, and accepting, South.
