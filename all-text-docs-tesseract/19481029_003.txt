What’s the matter ¢
with: Davidson's foot-
ball team? That’s a
question we’ve heard
not a few times in the
last couple of weeks.
The boys were riding
high when they hit
Kaleigh a few weeks
ago only to be knocked
down hard. Then they
managed to edge the
Citadel, and last week
to really make things
bad in the eyes of
some, they could do &
no better than boost
Woftford’s tieing record.

By JACK HAZARD

That sounds particularly bad when
when you think of the 54-0 drubbing which virtually this same
Wildcat eleven handed the Terriers only two years ago. But
it was a vastly improved Wofford team that held Davidson to
a 12-7 verdict last year, and a much more improved ball club
which played the locals on about as even terms as could be
found last week. Auburn Lambeth’s passing alone gave the
Cats a sizeable margin in every department.

The point that we would bring ont is fiat the Davidson
football team has not slipped. It has run up against teams in
its own class who are determined that Davidson will not have
a breather, Wotford in particular has launched a program
designed to:show Southern Conference teams that it will play
cousins to no one, The Pups’ athletic staff has shown utter
disregard for any and all eligibility rules whieh conference
teams must follow. They use any ball player whether
he has played elsewhere or not. Last week they used
freshmen in absolute violation of the contract made with
Davidson.

But that does not fully answer the question of what's
wrong with Davidson, though, we feel it is one reason. The
old injury jinx has taken no yatation from Coach Charlie
Jamerson’s forces this year. The Red and Black has not been
at full strength all year. And as if that werei't bad enough,
they journey to the VMI still minus the services of four stal-
warts because the day of the game happens to be the only day
that these boys can take exams for medsschool. To us this

seems strange and we don't know whether the cause lies with

the administ#@tion or the American Medical Association, Lhe

faet is that these four boys can take the exam on only one day
and might jeopardize their chances of entrance to med-sehool
if they didn’t. Ace flankman Buddy Cheek is foremost among
this group. Cheek is without a doubt one of the nation’s lead-
ing ends. He has been among the top ten pass receivers all
season and is always a horse on defense.

Cheek’s absence will put a strong dent in the corps of
Wingmen, but to make matter’s worse, Big Bill Johnson will
will not make the trip for the same reason. This leaves left
end in the hands of Mott Price and Marvin Kelly. Price is
still limping from a knee injury sustained in the State ganie,
and Kelly lacks the size and experience of Cheek,

The blocking back spot is hit hard by the loss of J. D
Ashmore for the same reason. Aslimore returned to the erid-
iron this year after several years’ layoff and has done sur
prisingly well in helping to fill the hole left by Dave Poole,

The line will be hit by the loss of Hugh MeArn who has
played behind Buddy Chandler on offense. His Joss will

leave only Chandler and Fred Preyer,

DAVIDSON AND V.MI. IN FAMILY TUSSLE

On Saturday, the Davidson Wild-
cats will tangle with their second
Virginia foe this year—the VMI
Kaydets—in a contest at Lexing-
ton, Virginia. As a result of their
recent invasion of South Carolina,
the Cats returned to the hill boast-
ing a win and a tie in tussles with
Citadel and Wofford, respectively.
Whether their invasion of the VMI
forces will be as successful is any-
body's guess. By virtue of a 14-14
tie with the Kaydets last year,
Davidson ranks about equal with
them; but the boys from Lexington
have always been hard to beat on
their home field,’as evidenced by
the trouncing they gave the Cats
two years ago, 25.0,

The teams that will Oppose each
other at the kick-off Saturday are
virtually the same that they were
last year. However, there is a no-
ticeable gap in the Red and Yellow
forward wall which was created by
the graduation of Malachi Mills, one
of the top tackles in the Southern
Conference last year. Also miss-
ing will be Joe Gantt, who was
the starting tailback. Still present in
the VMI lineup will be Bobby
Thomason, their ace flinger, who
is just about as potent as passers
come. If you will recall, at the end
of last year's game Thomason let
loose with one of his terrific long
passes which put the ball deep in
Davidson territory as the final
whistle sounded. It goes without
saying that the Cats pass defense
will have to be on its toes in a big
way to foil this air-minded fellow’s
plans.

Last Saturday night in the game
with Wofford, several of the Wild-
eats were injured; and it is too
early to determine how many will
miss the VMI game. Carl Shepherd
didn't see action against the Ter-
riers and will probably be ready for
action this Saturday, Auburn Lam-
beth, who, despite his injured left
hand, passed the Wildcats down
the field to set up the only score
against Wofford, should be in bet-
ter condition for this week. Buddy
Cheek and Mike Williams, the two
glue-fingered '’Cat flankers, both
suffered ankle injuries and may see
only pauted action.

Duke Licks
Cat Runners

“The Duke University Cross
Country team defeated the David-
son Harriers by the score of 17
to 40. The 3.8 miles course at Duke
was the scene of the meet on Octo-
ber 22, and it was practically an
all-Duke meet. It°was not the fact
that Davidson was running slower
than usual, but it was because the
Duke men were just a little faster.
Then, too, it was on Duke's home

track, With more meets coming up,
Davidson fans can be assured that
their Harriers won't be defeated
again by such a large score
