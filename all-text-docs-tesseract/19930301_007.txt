Coeducation:
A Professor's
Point of View

By Dr. Gill Holland

The assignment given to me a
couple of days ago was to reflect
oncoeducation over the last twenty
years. I can’t do it. I have been
unable to rein in the horses. Allow
me to start a decade earlier and
consider a larger scene. Blame the
two charming students on The
Davidsonian who caught me of
guard.

During the summer heat of
second semester examinations,
which were scarcely self-sched-
uled in the early sixties, the stu-
dents would be writing furiously,
as now, but stripped to their boxers
and sweating. The high ceilings of
Chambers were lowered later in
the decade to accomodate air con-
ditioning, the wooden floors over-
laid with stone.

In those earlier years Love
and Perkins were not blind spaces.
Standing outside east of Chambers
you would have seen the spectral
outline of the tall windows that
lighted and cooled the auditorium.
The bald head of the Dome Room,
now called Perkins, had eyes too.
Under large skylights in a semi-
theatre-in-the-round, plays were
performed for a smaller audience.
The patio and cafeteria in the old
student union, on the site of the
present E.H Little Library, were a
crossroads.

Today in good weather the |

present patio gives a taste of the
conversation once common on
campus. Just north of that union
the Davidson wildcat lived in a
cage. Acouple of timesa week the
cooks threw ita chicken. Ah, the
good old days.

At assembly, student leaders
had a chance to orate; some of
today’s college leaders trained
there or in the forums of Euand Phi
and the debate team. Yes, in the
good old days there was Chapel,
ROTC for most, Vespers followed
by visits to faculty houses, Satur-
day classes, and snow.

Ruminations on that chicken
and student snow sculptures be-
neath the Chambermaids have kept
me from my assignment, but even
when I accepted the job I knew I
would not be able to say much
more about women students at the
college except welcome and thank
you. Davidson sisters had of course

, gone to class here before; they

transferred credits and graduated
elsewhere.

The shift to degree-candidate
women students came, as one col-
league put it, without creating a
ripple in the curriculum. I have
never felt that the quality of aca-
demic discourse at the college
changed much with coeducation.
Some argued women would raise
it. In my judgement, however,
what has been raised is the quality
of the college as a society. On

many a weekend in the 1960s the |

college packed its bags and left.
Tonight in the library, Friday, Feb-
ruary 26th, 1993, there is hardly a
creature stirring. Some minds are
whirring, as in the old days, but the

Female Class of "77 Wouldn't Change a Thing
Most Look Back on College Careers with Sense of Pride

By Yvette Pita

On the first Saturday of Susan
Jonas’ freshman year at Davidson,
she was invited to an off-campus
rugby party because her
roommate’s brother was on the
team. She was one of the only girls
at the party, and there were a num-
7 of team members running

around in the nude. She thought to
herself, “This is weird.”

Jonas was a member of the
class of 1977, the first graduating
class at Davidson that included
women. According to her, the
mixture of the 60s culture, the
“preppy-types,” and new girls
made Davidson a strange place.

Perspective...

When Men Were Men
& Women Were Guests

By Amy Branch

“... when men were men and
women were guests. . .” While this
seems like a distant and forgotten
pastin Davidson’s history to many,
for some this statement describes
Davidson’s “glory years.” Al-
though women have been attend-
ing Davidson for overtwenty years,
there are still vestiges of
Davidson’s all-male past lurking
around campus.

Women have certainly made
their presence

that Bid’ not ‘just ‘disappear ‘when
Davidson first admitted women.
Even in 1993, there are still some
lingering perceptions of women
that perpetuate the “old-boy” im-
age of a pre-female Davidson and,
thus, hamper the total success of
women at Davidson. This attitude
is not so much the product of spe-
cific individuals as itis the resultof

150 years of tradition.
For example, it has been very
difficult for a strong female voice
to express her-

sible for a

presidents, and
even a Hall of
Fame athlete. These past accom-
plishments have helped to create a
very positive “Davidson experi-
ence” for many Davidson women.

Personally, there has never
beena time when I felt intimidated
by a male presence in the class-
room, and I have always been
wholeheartedly encouraged by my
professors to push for my goals.
However, it would be naive to be-
lieve that female students at
Davidson have nothing left to strive
for or to think that all of our battles
have already been fought.

After all, in what other book-
store can you still find a bumper-
sticker proclaiming, ““A Davidson
man needs no introduction,” even
though the school has been coed
for two decades? While this may
not be the most heinous crime, it
certainly exemplifies a mentality

woman to write
about women’s issues in The
Davidsonian without encounter-
ing negative responses from both
sexes in the next edition.

Although women are no
longer “guests” at this institution,
they are sometimes still treated as
such. Even though females have
held: offices and won awards,
women at Davidson, present and
future, still face an immense task.
They must continue to strive to
fully integrate the female perspec-
tive into Davidson’s tradition of
excellence.

My purpose in writing is not
to chastise the male population,
but, rather, to inspire the female
portion. I hope to encourage
Davidson women to always re-
member the accomplishments that
females have made at this school,
but not to rest on them.

What was it like to be a female
Davidson student in 1973? Ac-
cording to most graduates, it was
hard, but worth it.

Some women of the class of
*77 donotsee being the first women
on campus as a contri@ution to
their decision to enroll. According
to Patricia Andrews, “It was sec-
ondary to what I was after. What I
really wanted was a good pre-med
program.” She was also attracted
by the low student-to-teacher ra-
tio.

Laurie Bumgarner agrees.
“My whole life I was set on going
to Duke, but when I visited both
schools, I realized 1 felt comfort-
able at Davidson. I really didn’t
like Duke.” Inaddition, Bumgarner
has always thought of herself as an
independent person, and she never
felt the need to be with a group of
girls. She adds, “Even in high
school, most of my friends were
guys.”

However,

inappropriate, but the next year we
set up a group of madrigal singers
that women could bea partof, also.
By my senior year, enough women
had enrolled to make an all-female
chorus.”

Andrews also contributed to
the start of female programs on
campus. There were no sports for
women, but she gives Davidson
credit for starting them promptly.
“I was the first female athletic
trainer. It was a great experience
when I worked with the women’s
basketball team, and I also met my
husband when he broke his finger
during football season.” They were
later married at DCPC.

Although many of the male
Students dated. the new women,
their reactions sometimes contrib-
uted to the female students’
struggles. According to Jonas,
“Sometimes I felt that if we were
all nice southern girls, we would
have been more
accepted. Some

other women,
like Jonas, did
take into ac-
count the fact
that they would
be a part of a
ground-break-
ing class. “I
thought it
would be inter-
esting to be one
of the first, but I
didn’t know
what I was get-
ting into. It
turned out to be
much _ harder
than I thought.”
Although
most of the
women agree
that their time at
Davidson was
hard, it was an
experience that
none of them
would replace.
When asked
why her years at
Davidson were
positive,
Andrews re-
sponds, “Well,

Davidson Sex Li

of the males
called us
“women’s
libers.’ The first
year we en-
rolled, the men
still wanted to
nominate out-
siders for the
Homecoming
court. When I
said I didn’t
think that was
fair, one guy told
me, ‘You girls
are just trying to
ruin every tradi-
tion we have.’
Comments like
that made it very
hard, and unfor-
tunately caused
many girls to try
to blend into the
woodwork be-
cause it was too
painful to stick
out and take
abuse.

“That was the
first time in my
life that people
saw me as a

tion. When! vis-

‘student.’ I felt I

ited campus for
my interview, people stared as I
walked on the sidewalk. The next
year, 88 other girls were enrolled.
I thought that was a good number
of girls, and I didn’t think [life at
Davidson] was unusual.”

Most of the women agree that
their experiences were sometimes
astruggle. Jonas believes the hard-
est part for her was a feeling of
isolation, “I felt there was little
opportunity for women students to
be together. Many of the girls had
boyfriends and got separated into
different groups.”

In addition, when they en-
rolled, Davidson still lacked many
programs for women, and some-
times did not know how to deal
with the new female students.
Bumgamer auditioned for the male
tenorchorus. “I didn’tknow it was

was doing some-
thing good for the school, but a lot
of the men who didn’t want us
there made it seem like they were
doing us a favor by letting us in.”

Bumgarner believes that in
social situations, “there were awk-
ward times. I think a lot of the men
had chosen Davidson so that they
could concentrate on academics
during the week, and date on the
weekends.

"We had a problem with them
constantly importing other women,
but we made up a saying about
them: ‘Imports are girls; we’re
women.’”

ber of the class of ’77, and later

dent Life at Virginia Episcopal
