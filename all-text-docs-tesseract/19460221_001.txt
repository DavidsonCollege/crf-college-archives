The editorial staff of “Quips and
Cranks" announces that the 1946 is-
sue of this college year book will
be a full-sized book comparable to
pre-war annuals except for’a stu-
dent body slightly reduced in num-
ber?

Active work upon the annual was
begun last semester, but since every
effort is being made to approach
annuals of the pre-war years in size
and in activities represented the new
students who entered school at the
beginning of this semester and the
old Davidson men who have return-
ed will be included in this publica-
tion.’

The Junior editors include George
Gunn, who is working on the sports
department of the book. Gunn is
also doing part of the photography
for the annual. Frank Barr of the
Junior Class and Charlie Thompson,
a Senior, are handling the various
college activities, honorary societies,
etc.

The section devoted to the social
fraternities will be edited by Bill
Campbell, a Junior and Joe Foun-
tain of the Senior class. Bill White
aker is working as art editor:
