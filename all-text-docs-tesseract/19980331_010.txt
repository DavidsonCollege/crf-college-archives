Agents of Good Roots to bring their tubers to Spring Frolies

By Wes.ey H. GoOLDSBERRY
Arts & Living Editor

Just two weeks after the year’s first snowfall,
70-degree temperatures and lots 0’ sun took
Davidson’s fair campus by storm. It’s officially
spring; time for big inflat-
able boxing rings and velcro
suits.. The annual epic out-
doors adventure known as
Spring Frolics arrives this
Friday afternoon.

Heading the entertain-
ment bill this year is the Rich-
mond-based band Agents of
Good Roots, who will begin
playing the annual outdoor
Frolics concert at 9:00 p.m.
Friday at Richardson Field.
These Agents of Good Roots
have enjoyed a decent
amount of publicity in re-

* cent months, with their first
single “Come On” getting
significant airplay on
Charlotte’s 106.5 WEND
(“The End”). Their “Come
On” video received its debut
on MTV’s “120 Minutes” in
mid-March.

The band is made up of
Brian Jones (drums/lead vo-
cals),J.C. Kuhl (saxophone),
Stewart Myers (bass/vocals),
and Andrew Winn (guitar/
lead vocals). They play a
steady concert calendar of
over 200 shows per year.

Agents of Good Roots’s
first major label (RCA) release, “One By One,” hit
the CD store shelves last Tuesday. A group of
discerning music critics and I sat down recently to
assess this culmination of the Agents’s most re-

cent efforts.

A quick listen-through of “One By One”
reveals a band struggling to find itself. Agents of
Good Roots can’t decide what genre they want to
be. However, this might not be all bad.

The first and foremost track, “Come On,”

cannot escape the dreaded “college rock” catego-
rization. But they seemed to have a Living Colour
thing happening, which wasn’ tall that unpleasant.
In fact, we rather enjoyed it. So we kept listening.

Hip-hop elements were effluentin the album’s
next few tracks. Their style seemed to be less
“fun” and more “rock,” which had us wondering
how easy it would be to “groove” to the music once
it was performed live. Rumor has it that Agents of
Good Roots live shows are more tightly focused

on their improvisatory and “danceable” repertoire
rather than on their studio rock numbers.

The album’s fourth track, entitled “Upspin,”
really threw us. Their style had switched from

heavy and electric to light and happy. With the
incorporation of what sounded like gospel singers
and lyrics such as “You'll be singing in the sun,
you'll be dancing in the rain again,” most of us
were left nonplused.

Redemption came with the next song, “Miss
Misbelieving,” which had the
cheesiest title but was my
favorite track nonetheless.
This number was the album’ s
lone venture into the realms
of alternative country rock, a
genre made popular by bands
such as Son Volt and Wilco.
This song begins with a
soothing, pastoral steel gui-
tar prelude, which was “like
little puddles of cream in a
forest, under a birch tree.” It’
was just that serene.

The rest of the al-
bum escaped uniform cat-
egorization. “Smiling Up the
Frown,” which felt like I'd
heard it before, sounded like
glorified elevator music in
spots. In some moments,
Agents of Good Roots
sounded like Primus; in oth-
ers they sounded like the
Rollins Band or something
completely different. Conti-
nuity was simply nowhere to
be found.

“But,” it then oc-
curred, “so what?” Variety
is the spice of life, or so I’ve
been told. Agents of Good
Roots offers something for
everyone, and if what we’ve been told is correct,
their live show will be an entertaining one. I'll bet
they give The Nields (‘97 Spring Frolics invitees)
a run for their money.

Sarah McLachlan lived up to expectations and dreams
Singer/songwriter electrifies Independence Arena

By ANDREW WISER
Guest Writer

Some may say that I’m not the right person to
be covering the Sarah McLachlan concert that
took place last Wednesday night — and some
might say that I’m the perfect candidate. The
debate basically revolves around my obsession
and skewed bias for Sarah McLachlan... and, uh,
her music, too.

Butit’s not like I know all kinds of crazy facts
about her like that her birthplace is Halifax, Nova
Scotia, but that she now lives
in Vancouver, Canada, or
anything. I mean, Sarah
McLachlan was born in 1968
and began with studies in
classical piano and guitar, no
big deal. Sure, her middle
name is Ann and she has
sung for Pope John Paul II
before, buteverybody knows
that stuff, right?. Sarah (and
yes I feel close enough to call
her by her first name) did
spend several months in a
cabin by herself in Canada to
write her newest album “Sur-
facing,” butthat’s not sonew
and shocking. And how ob-
vious was it that even though
she has recently married
Ashwin Sood, who’s also her
band’s drummer, Sarah
stared at me for most.of the
concert. What a concert it
was!

Lisa Loeb’s performance before Sarah’s was
entertaining and enjoyable, but her band’s image
screamed “We're on a tiny stage in the middle of
Independence Arena’s massive floor (echo, echo,
echo)!” The addition of lowered lights, two 30-

@ Sarah McLachlan

foot-high tie-dyed tapestries, and low-ambered
lights lining the floor of the stage, however, trans-
formed the stage’s appeal from swallowed and
encompassed to intimate and private when:Sarah
came out.

It may be because of my dream-like stupor,
mind you, but even positioned thirty yards from
the stage in the company of several thousand other
fans, I felt as though I was in a small coffee shop
with a local performer.

Somehow accented on a stage filled with
her fellow band members, Sarah McLachlan
seemed to soak in the glow
of the spotlights. and
stagelights that illuminated
all around. The lighting was
unbelievable. They were
able to move at all angles
and directions simulta-
neously and cast hues of
purple, red, orange and yel-
low solely on either Sarah,
the band, or into the crowd
depending on the song. The
colors’ softness and tones
embodied the suppleness and
grace of Sarah’s music.

Basically, this was
not a concert for the lover of
strobe lights, smoke blow-
ers, and stage divers. That’s
not what Sarah aims for with
her music. Although Sarah
has the hard and electric fla-
vor in some of her songs, her
music is very personal and
filled with deep emotion
(hence the cabin seclusion for her newest album).
So, as Sarah coined the characteristic of the con-
cert as being a “musical roller coaster,” we (the
audience) jaunted on a two-hour ride of mellow

£ .iP Be

straightaways, powerful twists, and acoustic turns. —

The mellowness and softness of the concert
(and my favorite part of the ride) came in the
section of the performance that Sarah dedicated to
“Jove.” The use of red lights was crucial during
this portion of the concert and were dimmed only
for the effect of a starry sky splashed onto the
backdrop. This segment also rendered soft acous-
tic guitar rifts, light background vocals, and, in one
song, Sarah alone on the stage with her piano. Soft
sighs and an occasional “I love you Sarah!” (not
from me, however, because of my girlfriend’s
warning stare), were the only sounds evoked by
the crowd between the ridiculous clapping follow-
ing each song’s conclusion (which I actually did
do).

Sarah’s roller coaster continued on through
renditions of both older and newer releases and
added an occasional twist to each that only the true
and devoted fan could catch. The concert raced

faster and continued on without any of its riders
knowing when it would end. The old adage of
“keeping our hands and limbs inside the car at all
times” was drastically broken when Sarah an-
nounced the “end” of the ride, with all audience
members jumping to their feet in reverence of the
performance and in hope of an encore.

Much to our surprise, we received two en-
cores. The first encore included the full band
playing three songs which conjoined (for me at
least). the highly visible and fun‘side of her songs.
The second encore, however, fashioned only. by
the song “Angel,” represented the feeling and
evocation of meaning which Sarah’s music stands
for. “Angel” was performed by Sarah alone on the
stage; she was solely accompanied by lowly-
dimmed house lights, her piano, and a surrounding
of white candles. It was the perfect ending to a
dreamed concert.
