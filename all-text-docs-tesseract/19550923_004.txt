Good Use of Y Gift Fund [Explain Operation

The following is a copy of

inter-Church Service in Greek
Villages, concerning the use
of the money from fast year’s
Christmas Gift Fund of the
ay

Dear Sir:

Mr. Robert B. Tillman has in-
formed me that your gift of
$2,667.52 has arrived, for which we
wish to express our sincere appre-
ciation. As a steward of this money,
we would like to give this report
to you explaining how the money
in part was spent or is to be spent.

harvest of his garden as much as
three or four weeks. This year for
the first time, we had two farmers
who built hotbeds on their own
initiative asking us only for tech-
nical assistance. There is quite a
lot of interest in our latrine pro-
gram with several schools and a
number of individuals constructing
latrines with our supervision.

The Riziany irrigation project is
one of those things that cause us,
who try to stay within budget, to
turn grey headed. The pumps were

running several different kinds
of crop experiments, most of them
in cooperation with the local De-
partment of Agriculture. We have
87 different plots of wheat, nine
experimental plots of grasses to
be used for both hay and pasture.
We are also running an experiment
with potatoes under the super-
vision of the Greek Agriculture
Department. Fertilizers are used on
a part of nearly all experiments
with check strips to show the ef-
fect and results. We have already
obtained some startling results in
fertilizing spring oats. We are try-
ing to squeeze into this year's
budget, a trench silo to conserve
feed for the lean winter months.
Also we are trying to work out a
pasture rotation program for the
shepherds of this area. There is no
end to the possibilities in this type
of work.

Our hatchery program is nearly
at a close as far as chicks distribu-
tion is concerned. To date we have
placed over 7,000 good leghorn
chicks to villagers who have built.
poultry houses to our specifica: '
tions. Along with this, we are pro-:
posing a better feeding prograni,
culling and sanitation practices. It
is a little early to see any net re-
sults but we are quite pleased with
the overall interest in this project.
This coming year we would like to
enlarge our program by obtain-
ing another 1,000 chick battery.
This will enable us to keep chicks
until they are old enough to with-
stand the conditions of the village
poultry house.

We have learned one should
never generalize on beekeeping in
‘Greece. Our program. was to
furnish anyone who had a good
hive of bees with a modern bee hive.
We would help him transfer the
bees to the new hive. The price of
the hive made in the form of a
loan is to be paid back when the
first crop of honey is marketed,
this to be a revolving fund. Un-
fortunately in some areas, it was
too dry in summer and cold in
winter, therefore, the bees had to
be fed to maintain existence. We
have extended the loan another
year in these specific cases, In
other villages, where it is much
warmer, we have obtained excel-
lent results. One to four good bee
hives to a family means a great
deal in this country.

The latrines and hot beds are
catching on fast. This is our second
year for hotbeds therefore, it was
so much easier to sell the idea to

for a hungry people. Thanks to the

_good people of Davidson College
who helped make this possible
along with others who contributed
to the installation of these two
pumps.

Enclosed is a financial state-

;ment showing how the money is

being used in our work here. If
at any time you have any questions
as to our program here in Greece,
I will be very happy to be of serv-
ice to you. Also, if at any time a
representative from your college
could come to Greece, we would
‘be only too glad to show him first
‘hand what we are doing.

| Again. please accept our sincere
appreciation for the amount you
have contributed to our project.
One of the things we are most de-

ice to students. Little or no profit
is realized from it.

The store does receive on prac-
tically all textbooks a discount of
20 of the suggested. retail price:
however, from this 20% “profit”
must come all postal charges on
books and the salaries of the di-
rector, clerks, and bookkeepers.

The greatest expense of the

store, according to Prof. Kim-
brough. is the loss on books no
longer being used by the college.
New professors, almost without ex-
ception, use different books, leav-
ing the bookstore with a surplus
of “old” textbooks which must be
sold to used-book dealers at a low
price. .

Last year the bookstore earned
a net profit of $627; had the store
been required to pay rent, light
bills, ete., obviously it would have
lost mioney. According to Mr. Mar-
tin. this $627, along with all other
profit the bookstore has ever made,
was placed in the College Loan

number of chapels per week from
4 to 3, Freshmen and Sopho-
mores will be permitted five un-
excused absences in chapel rather
than six and Juniors and Seniors

graduation but also the 27 required
in the major. ,

meet their faculty counselors by
groups in faculty counselors class-
rooms at the chapel period (10:10
