Police spot checks for alcohol policy violations only a rumor

By Mary Laura Moretz

Amidst rumors of I.D. spot-
checks on Patterson Court, Direc-
tor of Public Safety Ray Thrower
says, “Nothing has changed since
last year” in the alcohol policy as
far as the police are concerned.

Recently, RLO’s wishes to

tighten enforcement of the rules
has worried students and caused
some speculation over how the
police will handle ‘drinking on
Patterson Court.

Thrower says the public safety
workers have always had the right
tocheck the I.D.’s of party-goers if

they suspected underage drinking.
“We certainly don’t go out saying
we’ re going tocheck acertain num-
ber of people on any given night,”

- he says.

Many students. feel uneasy
about the enforcement of the alco-
hol policy because RA’s can no

problem by yanking too hard when
the door won’t open.

Sandra Guzman was tempo-
rarily locked inside her bathroom
due to a faulty door handle.
Guzman says, “They have not been
very thorough—in our apartment
at least. Since the bathroom inci-
dent, we have been without a door-
knob for a week and a half after we
had been told we were first on the
list.”

Fire and Rain

When asked to explain the
water damage resulting from the
air conditioner, Pfahl blames faulty
construction, but also cites open
windows, as part of the problem.

Flashing lights and a painfully

’ loud, high-pitched fire alarm pro-
vide a familiar scenario to Martin

Court F residents. Engineers
should correct the fire alarm prob-
lem by next week.
Cable

RLO is still working on the
cable installation. Some residents
feel that cable is the most impor-
tant issue for the new apartments.

Frank Ingram says, “They are
trying to work out a deal with the
cable company; but meanwhile,
we’re paying for it.” In the other
Martin Court buildings, cable is
already installed, and residents re-
ceive it free with the apartment.

Pfahl attributes the preceding
setbacks to time constraints: “We
needed three weeks to do what we
had only one week -to.do.” The
building was finished on a Friday,
and students moved in on Satur-
day. Pfahl says, “Right now, we
are working the bugs out.” She

expects all complaints to be re-
solved by the end of September.

Debbie Young of RLO is
pleased with the overall success of
the new building: “This has been
the best opening of a new resi-
dence hall we’ve ever had.”

In 1988, Martin Court apart-
ment buildings D and E were in-
complete until Thanksgiving, leav-
ing numerous seniors stranded in
temporary housing. As for the
“bugs,” Young says “the students
are testing out the equipment we
didn’t have time to test.”

Most residents are pleased
with the new building, despite the
difficulties. | Alison Woodward
admits, “With any new building,
there are bound to be problems.
However, Martin F is a beautiful
building and the school, mainte-
nance, etc. are doing their best.”

time falling down and sliding into _

Most freshmen contend that
although it’s frustrating to ignore
what is clearly the social center of
campus—Patterson Court—it is
important to get to know the faces
of your own class.

Freshman Buster Burk ex-
plains, “If you’re not careful, you
might go up to some senior and
introduce yourself, and wind up
feeling like an idiot.”

Sophomore Susie Spressert
says, “I didn’t want to be an RA
when I found out how strict the
new rules were.” She feels the
alcohol policy already makes it

“hard for people to drink on the
court.”

SGA representative Laura
Jefferson says the alcohol policy is
a case of constant interest for the
SGA because “‘it’s always a con-
cern of the student body.”
