BETTER THAN BROTHERHOOD

Social Affiliates Find Their Position Ideal

Ten students already live in
the fraternity system on the
same basis that will be offered
by the secondary part of a
“Type A Bid” if the Fraternity
Affiliation Committee's propos-
als for 100 per cent affiliation
are accepted by the faculty for
next year.

Eight fraternities have at least
one social affiliate at the house
with one having three.

Social affiliates pay regular
dues and board if they eat regu-
~larly at the fraternity house.
They participate in most of the
fraternity activities and can sit
in on informal meetings and
voice their opinions about fra-
ternity policy. Formal meetings,
such as initiation, are barred to
them.

Among those interviewed there
was a resounding hurrah for the
‘good deal’ of being a social
affiliate. Sam Boyte said. “I’m
very pleased: it’s better than
being a brother.’ Bill Andrews

All of them were Independents
at one time and know what an
Independent's life is like. An-
drews said that the attitude of
fraternity men toward the inde-

' pendents has improved since he

has been at Davidson.

He feels that many of the fra-
ternity men rationalize this dis-
crimination away by thinking
that the Independents have what
they want and the fraternity
men have what they want, and
that’s the way it should be. An-

ly wrong in the fraternity sys-
tem as it is now operated. An-

ty.. Boyte received a bid his
freshman year but turned it
down.

B. A. Aiken stated that he
“could never be a brother.” ‘‘As
a whole.” he said, ‘fraternities
are a very bad institution; they

need a radical reformation and
this is evolving slowly.” How-
ever, Aiken is afraid that the
fraternities are ‘“‘not moving fast
enough for their own good.”

Leslie Brown found himself
sometimes “laughing at the
whole system. It all seems rath-
er ridiculous.” he said.

Freshman Allen Pusey found
that he went through rush and
saw a lot of his friends being
hurt. He continued, “It made me
stop and think and I wondered
what people were going after.”

Senior Bill Jones said that it’s
“practically ideal for me, . . .
with no desire to be a pledge or
to be initiated.”

Although they object to the
system, they all feel that there
is something to be gained and
something that they need that
the life of an Independent can-
not supply.

Aiken feels that the social life
can exist apart from fraternities,
but at Davidson it cannot at the
moment. Bradley emphasized

Pusey decided to try the system do not eat at the house regular-’ extra-curricular activities.
“to see if the social life is that ly, and pay only when they eat

much better.”

Andrews said he found that “a
number of people at the Pika
house would be stimulating, a
part of my education, and a
helpful part. I also wanted some
social advantages that Independ-
ents don't enjoy. where I could
live humanely, take a date, go to
a party.”

Brown felt that he wanted,
other than just an advantage in
social life, “to know what they
are like’ and to get to know
both sides of the system.

Andrews felt that brotherhood,
is an over-worked phrase. “I
don't exactly know what it
means.” he said, but added that
he believed it must be real to
some people.

Boyte feels that brotherhood
is ‘nothing more than guys who
like being around each other and
like to work together and help
each other out. but it’s not more
than being a good friend any-
where else."

Aiken feels that brotherhood is
“a feeling you have; I feel as
much a brotherly connection
with these boys. being initiated
wouldn't mean any difference.”’

Yet he feels that brotherhood
“exists on a campus this small,
even if you don’t have fraterni-
ties. It's a shame to limit this
relationship to a group of peo-
ple who have gone through the
same ceremony.”

There are some ‘‘distinct ad-
vantages,’ as Pusey said, to be
being just a social affiliate. The
most common advantage cited
was that no initiation fees have
to be paid, and to one who might
be in financial difficulty, affilia-

' tion with a fraternity can be-

come a reality.

Attendance at meetings are
not required and to a few the
atmosphere is freer than if one

Programs At Wake Forest

ED. NOTE: The present fu-
ror over chapel speakers and
the Reynolds tecture series
prompted THE DAVIDSON-

Challenge ‘67 as it was pre-
sented at Wake Forest last week-
end examined “‘The Implications
of Prosperity’’ more comprehen-
sively than Davidson students
have studied any topic utilizing
the potential of outside speak-

ers.

The Challenge series is a bi-
annual symposium of a three-
day series of lectures, seminars,
and entertainment on a select-
ed topic. George Lincoln Rock-
well, Norman Thomas, Dick
Gregory, Sen. William Prox-
mire, ‘Frank S. Meyer, Dr. Ed-
ward K. Buchanan, Herb Kap-
low. Craig J. Spence. the Seren-
dipity Singers, were among this

terested citizens and from stu-
dent projects provided $9.000 for
the program.

Many of the speakers were ac-
quired through agencies; others
were contacted personally. Con-
tacts were made last Novem-
ber; however, the program was
not complete until one week be-

fore it was scheduled.

‘‘How far ahead arrangements
are made depends on the speak-
er's appeal," said a student
spokesman. Kaplow and Greg-
ory came for $1200 apiece, an
amount reserved at Davidson
only for the Reynolds lecturers.

The Challenge lectures were
also broadcast over the college
tadio station. Others in previ-
ous years have been Robert
Kennedy, Vance Packard, Barry
Goldwater. Thomas Dodd. Wil-
liam Buckley, and James Farm.-.
er.

The Lecture Committee of the
College Union is composed of
eight members from all classes
and runs on a budget of $8,000
a year. Seven speakers of vari-
ous interests are usually sched-
uled.

A representative of the com-

sports could be added to in-
crease interest in the program.
To this suggestion, Rikard com-
mented that in student opinion.
physical education at Davidson
is a “farce.” He went further
and said that expansion of the
program would be contrary to
student opinion, and therefore
unwanted.

The final vote was 8-2, with
two members abstaining.

With Matthews unable to vote,
the negative votes were cast by
John Gresham and Julian Pros-
ser, the latter by proxy vote.
The two abstaining members
were Mike Powell and Bill Wat-
son.

Ken Autrey, Tom Earnhardt
and Paul Marion were absent.

mittee said that the line-up for
next year had already been com-
pleted. One member said that
“Faculty help is indirect in all
of this, but there is no commit-
tee as such that oversees and
approves our selections other
than the Dean of Men himself.”

Publicity consists of placards
over the campus and Winston-
Salem and advertisements in the
city and campus papers. A news
conference for the speaker is al-
so held. Special dinners are fre-
quently arranged.

Agencies are principally used:
packdge deals are used to save
money, and the speakers are us-
ually travelling a circuit of Car-
olina and Duke to cut costs and
increase co-ordination among
these three.

The Institute of Literature is
composed of the English. Ro-
mance, German, and Classical
language departments with a
budget of $4,000. Each depart-
ment acts independently in get-
ting speakers, but there is a
committee to coordinate the se-
ries,

There is a speaker every two
weeks who gives two lectures:
one is general and of interest to
all, while the other is more spe-
cialized. Recently they had Rob-
ert Penn Warren.

Each department of study has
a budget for their own speakers
with the department chairman
running the program. There is
a Political Science Colloquium
every two months. Many of these
speakers are from neighboring
colleges and receive only ex-
penses. ~

A student characterized the
faculty interest by saying,
“They’re pretty up on it.’ Stu-
dent apathy is not great; in fact
there was a complaint that there
were almost too many lectures.
One student said that there must
be a “lecture a night.’ At the
lectures by Rockwell and Thom-
as 2500-seat Wait Chapel was al
most filled.

Boyte stated that he “‘liked be-
ing an Independent for I was
able to do what I liked” and that
social affiliation “keeps me in a
role I like better."’ Boyte said.
“I think I made a wise decision
... 1 don't see any hindrances.”

Andrews echoed that state-
ment by saying that “I like to
think I can retain my independ-
ence.’ And Aiken said that there
are “no hindrances—if I did
feel that, I wouldn't stay."

Brown feels the same and added The affiliates were not hesi-'

None of the affiliates feel that
there Is any compulsion to con-
form to any fraternity ‘‘stand-
ards." Bradley emphasized this
in his remarks. Boyte said that
“TI can voice any sentiment even
if I do get some kidding from
Independents about being pseu-
do-independent, pseudo-fraterni-
ty.”

Andrews said that ‘‘] express
myself as a social affiliate, and
people know what I think about
the fraternity system. I can say
what I think.”

tant to speak their mind in dis-
cussing their role.

Social acceptance is felt by
all the affiliated. All are satis-
fied with their position, and none
feel any inferior position within
the fraternity.

Andrews said that “I'm ac-
cepted in the position I am. I’m
accepted nominally by some, but
there is no animosity however,

as it is in every house—it’s just
natural... I'm not at all shut
out .. . There is some criticism, |
but some of it is justified.” He
feels that his relationship is ‘‘dif-
ferent,” but that does not seem
to matter to the brothers. Brown
emphasized “I can fit into the
system more readily. It’s ideal
for me, and I'll recommend it to
others.”
