Sporting much more ex-
perience than past seasons have
had, the Davidson College cross
country squad should be im-
proved in the coming year.

Sterling Martin, head coach
of cross country and track, feels
that ‘‘there will hopefully be
some improvement over the 5-5
mark”’ that the team compiled
this past fall.

Leading the harriers will be
Ricky Bell, who won the most
valuable award in this sport
recently. Bell, a rising junior,
has tremendous potential and
“should be our top man,” ac-
cording to Martin.

Ron Clark is the only active
member of the team that will
graduate this year. Thus, the
harriers will be quite ex-
perienced and very deep.

‘‘We will play about the same
schedule as last year,” said
Martin, ‘although we do hope to
add a few other teams with
whom we could be more com-
petitive.”

Along with meets which will
involve four conference foes,

Harriers Improving,
Experience Big Factor

Sports Editor

the team has contests with St.
Andrews and Campbell,
Washington and Lee, and a five-
way meet which includes Wake
Forest, Pembroke and High
Point.

“The conference will be about
the same as usual,”’ said Mar-
tin. ‘“‘William and Mary should
have little trouble winning,
although Furman and possibly
ECU could give them a run tor
their money.”

Speaching of the Cats chan-
ces, Martin commented that,
‘We are still talking of a sixth
place finish, with an outside
shot at fifth. We just are not that
strong and won't be for at least
two years.”"

Martin emphasized that the

team will have to improve on
their actual running, as they
will be competing on the six-
mile route the entire season.
. But he is optimistic for Bell,
who he thinks could very prob-
ably be one of the “best run-
ners in the conference next
year.’

Soccer Tries For NCAA Bid
In Stone’s Initial Campaign

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

Under new coach Chip Stone,
the soccer team will face what
is probably their toughest
schedule ever next fall.

“The schedule calls for
games with the University of
North Carolina, Duke, Ap-
palachian, Furman, and State,”
said Stone.

“These will aH be tough
games but the rest of the
schedule is pretty easy. The ad-
vantage to this is that if we lose
a big game, then we'll probably
bounce back against one of the
smaller schools,’ Stone con-
tinued.

The soccer team will attempt
two new things next fall ac-
cording to Stone. They will use a
new offense and will try to gain
an NCAA playoff invitation.

“The new system that we're
planning to use is a drastic
change from what anyone who
follows soccer around here has
ever seen,'’ Stone stated,

He explained that the new
system is more of an_ in-
ternational type than has ever
been used at Davidson.

“It’s a 2-4-4, two forwards,
four halfbacks, and four
fullbacks. In the past we have
used a 4-4-3 or a 5-3-3, the same
as most of our opponents,”
Stone said.

“The other two styles are
transitionally weak, the team’s
weakest point in those for-

mations is when they make the
transition from offense to defen-
se. But this formation
eliminates those mistakes,”’ he
continued.

The team will not have any
men on the wings, but the mid-
dle of the field will be much
stronger according to Stone.

He said that the two factors
which influenced him to in-
stitute the change are the
team's speed and quickness.

“They are the most essential
elements to a soccer team. If
you've got speed and quickness,
then you can make things hap-
pen,"’ Stone said.

“The winner of the Southern
Conference soccer cham-
pionship does not automatically
receive a bid to play in the
NCAA championships. You

have to beat some good teams
and that's why we scheduled
State, UNC, and Duke,”’ he said.

“] think that we'll have to win
at least two of our games with
those schools, if we lose any
than two games all year, then
I'll consider it a bad year,”
Stone added.

He went on to say that Ap-
palachian and Furman will also
be important games for the
team in light of the fact that
both schools have started to im-
prove their soecer programs in
the last year. Stone cited Ap-
palachian as an example,
stating that they have signed
several players on scholarships
for next year.

“I think we can be very good
however,” he said.
