Politics...

ft seems fairiy evident that Davidson wilt
continue to move along in the same groove
politically for some time, and there seems
wo be no better solution to the problem.
Here, we try to. keep polities out of clections
entirely, The ideal is the conscientious vote
ot every man.

towever human nacure just doesnt run
that way. Aneidealist is much to be admired
bur somehow his is not always the practical
attitude. We must realize that as long as
there are elections there will be polities.
This year’s election scandal. the uncovering
oi. a maze of fraternity vote-swapping en
terprises. is cnough reason to believe that
the pledge shouid be put before fraternity
presidents every year.

Open polities might work, for a ume at
Davidson, but eventually contention would
grow great enongh to make the campus a
“hotbed” of rivalry and contention. No. the
only solution, even though it is conservative
and in the same cut, apparently is tffe pol-
iey tollowed by the present student council :
“Keep the eleetions as clean as possible.”

Glee Club...

last week the Glee Club returned irom
what was termed a highly successful con-
cert tour. from the state syndicated: column
“Music Comment.” the authoress, Mes.
Laura Howell Norden states:

“Judging by their coneert in Wilmington,
last Sanday, the Davidson College Glee Club
is doing spiendid work under the direction
of Thane MacDonald. member of the faculty
of the music department. Mr. MacDonald's
quiet manner on the podium and the faet
that he conducted the program from mem-
ory made a very favorable impression.”

~~ We are ail too prone as Davidson stii-
dents to fail to give credit where credit is
due. And we feel that the Glee Chub and
their competent leader deserve an orchid. tn
the words of Walter Winchell. Probably the
main reason tor the efficient work of the
Glee Club is the degree of co-operation and
good-will twat seems to exist between the
group and the leader.

Pan-Germanicism

An Editorial by FIELD HORINE

Last weck there was Austria. This week
there is a Germany, larger by the 6,760,000
inkabitants of its newest province, German-
Austria; and, for the first time in history,
Vienna is subjeet to Berlin. Bismarck could
have had it thus in 1866 had he wished; but
he had his reasons jor not desiring a union.
This time such reasons were not in evidence,
and when opporturtity knocked Adolf Hitler
answered. For no one knows better than he
that she may knock but once. _

Most of the world stood aghast and some-
what angered. Out why? Hitler had grounds
to suppose Utat a majority of the Austrian
populace javored anschluss. That this was
the case has been adraicced by even the most
reluctant observers in Austria during the
past few days. during which popular eathus-
iasm in that country has risen to utterly un-
preesdented heights, Chanectlor Schusthnigg
had detinixely violated his Berentesgaden
agreement with Ifitler by suddenly calling
ior a plebiscite, whieh ineidentally would
‘have been illegal aecording to the 1934
| Austrian constitution. In addition, the pleb-
iscite was to have been held within the short
space of three and one hali days. There
were no adequate polling facilities, sinee
Austrians had not had occasion or oppor-
tunity to vote sinee 1930. Pjans for ballot-
ing were nothing short of farcieal, since the
answer “Yes” was to have been already
printed on the ballots, and those wishing to
vote “No” to Schuschnigg’s newest idea of
ousting Nazis ¢ompletely were to have had
to use their own sheets of paper exactly five
by ewght centimeters | Aad, besides. if Schu-
schnigg hat really wished to determine the
people's wiil. he might have called for a ref-
crendum before his conierenee with Hither.

Is it aay wonder then that members of
Schuschnigg’s own cabinet demanded his
resignation? Does it, under the cireum-
Stanecs, seem at all sirange that llitler used
the occasion to unite what is really one
people under one government and one
leader?

Senior Slants

“Davidson and Open Politics”
| In recent weeks there has been much
talk on the campus of changing from our
i present system ot elections to one of open
polities. The idea has been discussed in the
Letters to the Editor
and in the “Question of
the Weck"! eotumn, but
| feel that it would not’
be amiss to add some-
thing further here. Re-
cently I have had the
Opportunity to observe
the workings of politi-
Beal systems on other
campuses, and it seems
to me that they are
unitormiy bad. no matter how they are run.
, And, } believe that sueh systems would be
bad tor Davidson, ior reasons whieh I stall
outline bricily:
First, any good to be gained will be in-
Significant. Most of the ardent exponents
oF the open svstem sill admit that the idea
is purely selfish a method to help their
draternity gain a few more offices and thus
more prestige. But the result would he that
ottiees would have to be distributed among
all the fraternities, or among the ones in the
strongest combine, Either way would ut-
terly deprive the non-iraternity man of of-
fice, would hinder Many men in fraternities
with several poterttial leaders, and would
merely aid a ew fraternities who could fot
gain offices for their men any other way.
It is easily seen that such results could do
no good, and any prestige gained for the
lesser lodges would not be worth the price

ra

.

if its members had any self-respect what-
soever,

Secondly, it would create dissension
among the fraternities themselves and be-
tween them and other groups. In every
coliege where such a plan is used, the fra-
ternities are constantly at each other's
throats, with detrimental results to good-
will, co-operation, and school spirit in gen-
eral. Recently in a large southern univer-
Sity one student shot and killed another
e over just this sort of thing. We have re-
cently given the freshmen voting power Jin
order to aid school spirit. Such a systern of
politics would not only counteract any good
results, but would bring quick death to all
school spirit.
Davidson has a reputation everywhere for
clean politics. Let's not for any selfish
reason degenerate into a group of schem-
ing, squabbling politicians, We have enough
of them outside:

HOW SHALL WE
KNOW CANDIDATE'S
QUALIFICATIONS? . ..

To the Editor:

There has been a lot of loose
talk going around suggesting that
weshave some sort of controlled
politics on this campus. The argu-
tment seems to be that we don't
know each other quite well enough.

Controlled politics usually con-
notes party organizations and cam-
paign speeches. This would ob-
viously be a great evil. The main
argument against politics is that we
do know each other well cnough.

The fact of the matter is that we
know each other well enough Sn
one way, but not always in regard
to ability for the offices for which
We nominate each other. The us-
ual answer ‘to the question, “Whom
! gonna vote for?” is “John Doe.
He's a good boy.” or “He's a fine
tellow. [ roomed with him my
treshman vear.” We know him all
right, but not im the right way.

How then can we present each
other's qualiiications for gny partic-
ular job without getting into poli-
tics? The solution seems simple

dent council, YMCA cabinet. Dav-

around, Just so its brief. dignified.

one) should take care of itseli.

denunciation, he said:

“It simply infuriates me to see our
universities having to give courses
in elementary French or German,
taught by young scholars who
ought to be doing advanced work

be taught our children in the lower
