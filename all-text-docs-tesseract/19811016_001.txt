Problems with student noise

Davidson town council considering noise ordinance

Town and gown clashed last
Tuesday as about a half dozen irate res-
idents of North Main Street presented a
petition signed by 33 people to the

- Town Council asking for a “more com-
plete noise ordinance.” They want the
ordinance primarily to restrict noise
from student parties.

The Town Council voted unani-
mously to appoint a committee of ap-
proximately five people to study the

' complexities and legal requirements of
a noise ordinance. —

Davidson curently has no noise
ordinance.

Mayor Nancy: MacCormac said
that she will form the committee by

“early next week. Residents, College
‘officials, town officials, arid students

will serve on the committee. Mayor:

‘MacCormac said she will ask Dean of
Students Will Terry to appoint students
to serve on the committee.

_ SGA representatives intend to

“speak with Mayor MacCormac about
the possible ordinance.

Main Street started the petition in re-

“noise on campus and from perimeter

housing as well as from both off-cam- |=».

Main Street said, “I refuse to go into
hibernation like a troglodyte to hear
myself think.”

~~. Mrs. Strough’ said after the Fown -
Council meeting, “Students must real-

ize that the whole town does not re-
volve around hard study and raucous
play.”
A letter she wrote accompanying
the petition asked the Town Council to
“prohibit outside amplified music at all
hours in all neighborhoods. ‘Lower the
accepted decibel level. for outdoor

-events at the: college. Move up. the...

noise cut-off times to:10 pm on week-
days and 11 pm on weekends. See that
students living off campus realize that
better behaviour is expected of them.”

Mayor MacCormac said that the
process of enacting a noise ordinance
is “somewhat complex.” Officials
must conduct a noise survey in the
town and have state officers train town

officials © howto use ‘ measurement
equiptment.

Mayor MacCormac said that she-
and Associate Dean of Students Sue
Ross attended a workshop in Charlotte
on enacting local noise ordinance.
