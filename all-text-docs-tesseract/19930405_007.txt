In Defense of Fraternities and Sororitites (Eating Houses)

WhenI washome over Christ-
mas, a dinner guest and I, after
debating the usual topics, started
discussing fraternities and sorori-
ties. Surprisingly, this argument
became much more heated than
even our exchange about Dan
Quayle. It is not altogether shock-
ing that there are many who op-
pose the notion of fraternities and
sororities. However, the bitterness
and suppressed anger that surfaces
when these organizations are dis-
cussed caught me off guard.

“Fraternities and sororities are
‘elitist,’” she thought. “They pre-
vent one from concentrating on
school work. They are for imma-
ture alcoholics who require ready-

_ made friends. They fly in the face

of the mission of education: expo-
sure tonew things.” It wentonand
on. Finally I asked her why her
company became a company, and
notjustan informal group of people
working together. She replied that
the benefits of becoming a formal
business are many. I agreed and
asked why it is different for a so-
rority. A group of girls who are
friends cannot possibly doas much

as a group of girls who are friends ,

and an organization. Service
projects, trips, events, and activi-
ties are’all funded through dues
people pay to their fraternal orga-
nizations. Do you think I would be
in a composite picture with many
of my friends if we were not in an
organization? Would we go on

In Black and White...
Malcolm X: the Early Years

By Scott Windham and
Deidra Montague ©

This week we continue our
discussion of Malcolm X, from his
childhood to his early years in the
Nation of Islam.

Malcolm Little was born in
Omahain 1925. His father, a Chris-
tian minister, spoke openly for
black concerns and as a result was
killed—tlikely by the Klan—when
Malcolm was very young. His
mother, under severe stress to keep
the family going, slowly lost con-
trol and was committed to a men-
tal institution. Living with a kind,
white foster family, who despite
his brillianceneverconsidered him
talented, Malcolm did extremely
well in school until a pivotal meet-
ing with one of his teachers.

Expressing his desire to be-
come a lawyer, Malcolm was told
that, since he was black, he should
aspire at most to become a wood-
worker. Malcolm slowly entered
into a life of crime, spending ten
years of his young life hustling in
the streets of Boston and New York,
using drugs and robbing homes,
for which he was eventually ar-
rested.

It was in jail that he rid him-
self of drugs, developed his mind
in the prison library and his speak-
ing skills in prison debates. Letters
from his Muslim brother and from
Elijah Muhammed, the leader of
the Nation, introduced Malcolm to
Islam. Upon his release from jail,
Malcolm joined the Nation of Is-
lam, and, following the custom of
the Nation, dropped the name Little
in favor of an X. The X repre-
sented the African name Malcolm
never knew; he rejected the name
Little because it was given to his
family by white slaveowners.

Malcolm X’s notoriety spread
as he rose in influence within the
Nation of Islam, becoming more
and more closely tied to Elijah
Muhammed and helping to spread
the Nation all across the United
States. Malcolm, who considered
Elijah Muhammed his savior, was
extremely dedicated to him and his
beliefs, not only accepting but de-
veloping the ideas promoted by
the Nation of Islam. These beliefs
sparked fear among white America,
who saw them as reverse racism,
anarchy, andadvocacy of violence.

The fear of the majority of whites
in the United States was under-
standable, but misguided. They
saw only the side of Malcolm X
that the media was willing to por-
tray, such as his hasty statement—
which he later regretted—that he
was happy to hear of the fatal crash
in Paris of a large plane full of
whites.

Malcolm was not so much
anti-white as pro-black, though he

thought that white people were the -

rootof most problems facing black
America. He was the first to pro-
mote the theory that white oppres-
sion of blacks in the United States
was only a small part of worldwide
oppression by whites of dark-
skinned peoples, giving examples
such as India, Africa, and South
America. Social and economic
withdrawal from society were in-
dispensable to help blacks advance.

Malcolm X insisted that whites
had—taken— everything from
blacks—their home, their: name,
their language, and their pride.
Though he didn’t necessarily ad-
vocate violence, he believed in the
betterment of the black race,
through any means necessary to
reclaim those things stolen from
blacks.

An interesting parallel to this
mindset is that of the first Euro-
pean colonists to America. Sur-
rounded by people of another race,
these colonists felt isolated and
afraid, and were willing to under-
take whatever measures were nec-
essary—including violence—to
survive.

One of the first in the black
nationalist movement to demand
that whites respect blacks and
blacks respect themselves,
Malcolm X insisted on the need for
blacks to’ receive not only civil
rights, which affect only the law,
but human rights as well, which
affect attitudes.

The counterpart of this call

“was his disrespect of whites, which

eventually grew into hatred. Draw-
ing from hisexperiencesasa young
boy and his inside look at the life of
poor urban blacks, Malcolm began
calling the white man a blue-eyed
devil, inherently evil and respon-
sible for the misery of Native
Americans and blacks in the United
States and other races abroad.

remember our parties? Would we
develop new traditions and carry
on old ones? It is terrific to see a
“Rusk 15th Anniversary” shirt and
know that our present Ruskies ac-
cepted and will pass on the torch of
sisterhood. How proud one must
have been to be a member of the
first Connor class. It is tremen-
dously exciting to read the history
of Pi Kappa Alpha because we are
part of it. We develop friends
across the country, we have com-
mon ground with alumni, we have
responsiblilties to the Pikes of the
past, and we have something that
will follow us through life. It is
financially and historically clear
that being official organizations
makes fraternities and sororities

special.

Are fraternities “elitist?” Not
by nature. Some adopt a negative
attitude towards other people, yet
that is not caused by the fraternity.
Friendship is natural, and is based
onshared experiences. I’mas likely
to be friends with the girl who
muddled through Economics with
me as I am to be friends with my
fraternity brothers. If fraternities
are so eletist, why do I know so
many people? Fraternities and
eating houses provide continuity
at a large school and increased
opportunities at a small one. The
tradition and sense of place a fra-
ternity provides is invaluable as
one attempts to negotiate the ob-
stacle course that is college. —

‘Moore Expresses Surprise.at Accusations

Moore continued from page 5

the process of taking it from the
rack. Regardless of color, if I do
not recognize the person I will
check their identification. I’m sure
that some of you are very aware of
this practice. I admit it can be
annoying, but it’s done in the bet-
ter interest of the Davidson Col-
lege Community from a loss pre-
vention perspective.

It is unfortunate that this par-
ticular incident was made to ap-
pear racially motivated. I can can-
didly say thatI am in no way preju-
diced toward blacks, nor am I bi-
ased in any ofmy actions. Yousee,
I am also African-American; I am
also asmall part of a small percent-
age at Davidson. Iam proud of my
race, my culture, and the continu-
ing strives that we make for ad-
vancement. I never let race, sex,

religion, or anything else that can
be viewed as discriminatory, inter-
fere with my making sound, just,
and timely decisions. I have
worked here on the campus as a
Public Safety Officer for a little
over a year now and this is the first
time that I have had to deal with
accusations concerning prejudice
or-bias.

This situation is ironic because
I figured that if anyone was ac-
cused of such actions, they would
probably be white, not black. I
must admit, even though I know
that it is necessary, I have my ap-
prehensions about checking the ID
of any person whom I think could
possibye be a student or otherwise
affiliated with the college. I feel
confident that this incident will not
affect me while performing my
duties as I have in the past, yet it
has awakened me to certain reali-

ties.

One thought that I would like
to leave you with is that certain
people have responded very nega-
tively toward this departmentsince
the reporting of this incident, stat-
ing: that the fact that it was an
African-American officer involved
in the incident had no bearing on
the fact that they believed the inci-
dent to be racially motivated. It
seems that many people feel that
police officers stereotype blacks
as thieves, rapists, drug dealers,
etc. I must admit that the crime

rate among blacks on a national

basis is very high right now, but
this fact would not make it right for
police officers to stereotype all
blacks as potential criminals. Nor
is it right for anyone to stereotype
all police officers as being biased.

Sincerely,

Officer S.T. Moore

College police have top priority of keeping campus safe

DCPD continued from page 5

are up; 92.7% of persons arrested
were white.

We would like to assure all
students that the first priority of all
of our campus police officers is
your safety and well-being. It is
without doubt that some of you
will be approached by someone in
this department and asked to pro-

duce some form of ID, so please’

understand that this is done in your
best interest and without preju-
dice.

Our door is always open to
anyone wishing to address con-
cerns of our policies or actions
taken by this department.

In conclusion, the only abso-
lute solution to this problem would
be to prohibit the officers from

questioning the identity of anyone
oncampus. Unfortunately, apolicy
of this nature would not be consis-
tent with the safety and well-being
of the college community. We
will, nevertheless, do all we can to
eliminate even the perception of
prejudice.

Sincerely,
