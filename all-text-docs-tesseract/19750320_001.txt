Good Friday Fast Supports
CROP World Hunger Efforts

By ANDREW LAMAS
Executive Editor

“The idea behind our March
28th fast is that half the world’s
3.7 billion people go hungry
every day, and we want
the Davidson community to
know it and experience some
measure of it,’’ remarked cam-
pus coordinator of the CROP
hunger campaign Bob Mooty
(’76).

Mooty is organizing a fast and
fund-raising drive to aid
famine-stricken peoples in the
Sahel region of Africa.

‘“‘We hope to collect $2,500 to
$3,000 in our one-day fund-
raising drive.

“All of the money collected
will go to CROP, who will then
buy large quantities of food and
distribute it to people in the
Sahel,’’ commented Mooty.

CROP is the Community
Hunger Appeal of Church World
Service (CWS).

“Since its inception in 1947
through 1972, CROP has raised
more than $60,000,000 for CWS
programs of disaster relief and
self-help projects. This has
directly aided more than
20,000,000 people in some 50
countries around the world.”’

CROP’s operating expense
totals 19 percent of all monies
collected. Hence, 81 percent of
the money donated to CROP by
Davidson students will reach
the people in the Sahel region in
the form of food.

‘‘Most major Protestant chur-
ches fund their ‘hunger’
donations through CROP,”’ said
Mooty.

The Davidson College
Presbyterian Church will spon-
sor a communion service on
Thursday, March 27 in order to
initiate the fasting on Friday.

“The DCPC has been pushing
this fund-raising effort with its
congregation. They have been
very helpful,’’ said Mooty.

Biblical Narrative Threatens

White Middle Class America

By JIM KNIGHTS
Staff Writer

‘‘He has sent me to announce
the good news to the poor, to
proclaim release for prisoners,
... to let the broken victims go.”’

This statement of mission
was advanced by Dr. Robert
MacAfee Brown, professor of
Religion at Stanford Univer-
sity. Brown was on campus this
week as an Otts lecturer.

While at Davidson, Brown
lectured in an attempt to retell
the biblical story so that it
might be understood and in-
corporated by modern man into
his life and world.

Using a survey of various
literary genres, Brown presen-
ted his concept of ‘‘our story’’.

For Brown “our story’’ is sim-
ply white, middle class
America.

According to Brown, our
story is inherently oppressive to
both the third world countries
and minority groups in this
country. It is oppressive to
these people because our story
involves a loyalty to the sexist,
racist, flag-waving, middle
class way of life.

Brown’s reworking of the
biblical story, (Brown calls this
re-write The Story) is palpable
to all cultures and fosters cer-
tain understand from one
culture to another.

The Story is generally
equivalent to the biblical
narrative, but Dr. Brown
believes it does more than this.

“It sets us free”, said Brown.

The freedom we receive from
the story, is not a comfortable
one, according to Brown. We
are ‘threatened and made afraid
by the new biblical narrative.

“It sets us free to hear the
voices of minority groups and

third world-nations--voices
which are usually filled with
anger for our lifestyles and
values.. The values we tend
seem to oppress the rest of the
world’’, said Brown.

Brown suggests that the story
frees us for good by demanding
more loyalty to the Story of a
God who acts on earth.

“The Story demands a loyalty
to the God who participates in
the sufferings and oppressions
of the poor and weak. The
freedom we obtain from this
loyalty is subversive and calls
us white, middle class
Americans to exist as_par-
ticipants in this story, denying
our racist, sexist,\ flag-waving
middle class ideas as they serve
to separate us from our
brothers and sisters who come
out of diffferent backgrounds,”

he said.

The Story Brown told while at
Davidson was developed out of
the Bible to be applied to our
non-biblical lives. To bring this
home to Davidson students,
Brown concluded by saying:

“We should remember with
Jirn Cone that ‘The oppressors
cannot possibly mean the same
thing when they speak of God.
The God of the oppressed is a
God of revolution who breaks
the chains of slavery. The op-
pressor’s God is a God of
slavery and must be destroyed
along with the oppressors.’

“The Story demands a

Mooty, along with ten other
volunteers, has canvassed all
the freshman’ halls during the
past week.

‘So far we’ve found about 200
people to help us and jion in the
fasting.

“Soon, we’ll be going around
to the eating houses. As with the
freshmen, we’re going to solicit
their aid for the March 28 fast,”
remarked Mooty.

Those students who eat at
Patterson Court will be asked to
donate to CROP the money
their house would have spent on
food had they not fasted.

“We're going to ask the
fraternities to contribute money
to CROP on a per person, per
meal basis,’’ said Mooty.

Students who use meal tickets
at Slater’s will be asked to con-
tribute to CROP with cash or
through a system arranged by
Mooty with Director of Slater’s
Eating Service Ron Scott.

“Ron Scott said that on
Friday students could have
their meal tickets punched for
the amount of money they
would like to donate to CROP.

“«Scott would then donate fifty
percent of all such monies to
CROP, since his food costs run
fifty percent of his expenses,’
stated Mooty.

Professors, members of the
college staff, and others will
have an opportunity to donate
money to CROP at a collection
booth to be set up in Chambers
Building.

On Tuesday, April 1, at the
Campus .Community Worship
Service, Mooty and the North

Carolina-Virginia Director of
CROP Terry -Bonnette will be

present.

‘“‘At the worship service all of
the proceeds will be given to
Terry Bonnette,’’ said Mooty.

Mooty became interested in
‘aiding the people of the Sahel
region through CROP at the
recent State Youth Convention

of the. Christian Church
Disciples of Christ.
‘‘Last-year CROP sent over 85

tons of high protein food, beans,
NFD milk and other foods to the
Sahel (Niger specifically) to
help alleviate suffering.

“This year, more than $15,000
has already been sent to aid the
Aire Oasis reclamation
program. A large volume of
clothing and health and hygiene
items have also been shipped.”’

Famine is now commonplace
in the sub-Saharan countries of
Chad, Mali, Maurtamia, Niger,
Senegal and Upper Volta.

“For over six years there has
been no significant rainfall (in
the Sahel). The crops are gone;
the ‘desert is rapidly moving
south, consuming the grazing
land in its path.

‘‘Lakes, wells and rivers have
dried up. Breeding cattle and
seed grain have been eaten to
stave off approaching star-
vation.

‘Disease is rampant. Over 25
million people are affected.
Over 100,000 have already died.
One United Nations estimate
predicts the toll could go as high
as 6 million dead by November,
1975.

“Last year’s emergency aid
programs, launched world-
wide have already saved more
than 1 million Africans from
starvation.”

Co-coordinators of the CROP
fast are Charlie Shepherd, Bill
Bond, Sally Stowe, Margaret
Hinter, Mark Davidson, Susan
Murdaugh, Tenley Shewmake.
Dan Thorpe, John Munce, and
Mark WILENSKy.
