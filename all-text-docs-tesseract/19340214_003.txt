Eu Delegates Present
Program in Charlotte

A delegation from the Eumenean
®Literary Society gave a program be-
fore a combined audience of both lit-
erary societies of Queens-Chicora Col-
lege Tuesday night.

The principal feature of the program
was a debate, the query of which was,
“Resolved: That examinations as a
test of knowledge should be abolished.”
Hugh Hawkins, former president of
the society, argued that the practice
of cramming, the large field of a sub-
ject as compared with the small num-
ber of questions and the ill effects of
over-studying caused examinations to
be undesirable.

To this, John Shirey replied that
studying for an examination caused
the student to view the subject as a
whole and to refresh himself on the
major points. “ The real test of a man’s

ability,” argued Shirey, “is not what
he knows but his ability to display it

at the proper moment.”

Gordon Wood read-a-paper on Ee:
Cummings, his life, work and ability.
FE. S. Hodge discussed Hitler propa-
ganda in America, and R. T. Banks
gave a humorous reading to conclude
the program, which was led by Rufus

Morrow, president of the Eumenean
Society.
The Queens-Chicora societies will

make a return visit to Davidson in

the near future.

This indoor meet at the West Vir-
ginia school is one of the biggest of
its kind inthe East, and a strong
aggregation always participates.

The last time Davidson men entered
this contest. was four years ago, when
“Pete” Whittle, present assistant di-
rector of athletics, and Tom Brohard
attended the same meet. It was at this
time that Whittle tied the world indoor
record existing at that time in the 70-
yard hurdles.

It is around the three above-men-
tioned men that Captain Pritchett ex-
pects-to build up his 1934 track team,
for which he holds hopes of being one
of the best ever to enter competition
in Davidson’s name. The first sched-

dermen is with Wofford on March 24
