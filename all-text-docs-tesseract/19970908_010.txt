Exhibit traces artist’s

decade-long development

ake a walk this month

| through the Smith Gallery
of the Vi-

sual Arts Center

and you will see a

1960s artist Eva Hesse’s graceful
organic forms and gravity-teasing
games with the
themes and stories
that have haunted

sampling of New

York sculptor
Linda Matalon’s
work. Unavoid-

able and lending its name to the
show’s title is What Remains, a
hanging piece that dominates the
gallery space
with its con-
gregation of
paired oblong
hanging ob-
jects.
Common
to much of
Matalon’s
work is such
use of sus-
pended pieces
hung by wax-
coated wire.
Her gauzed
and waxed
forms often
hang from or cling to borrowed
gallery walls. Matalon combines

The film begins rather slowly,
tracking a cabbie named Jerry
Fletcher (Mel Gibson). Jerry likes
to share paranoid ramblings with
his passengers about goverment
plots, assassination schemes, UFOs,
and so on. Jerry is a geyser of
paranoid political fantasies, and no
passenger is safe from
his ruminations about
what “they” are doing ©
to“us.” Jerry sees plots
and conspiracies of evil
in everything from the
death of Jerry Garcia
to the success of Oliver
‘Stone. He’s also ob-
sessed with a Justice
Department attorney
named Alice Sutton
(Julia Roberts). Jerry
is clearly just not quite
right in the head. Alice
becomes entagled in
his warped world, try-
ing to determine
wheter he’s a basically benign nut,
a seriously deranged killer, or the
victim of a pernicious experiment.
Fortunately, Alice is played by Julia
Roberts, so you know she will de-
cide, and does, and the two proceed
to outwit the evil masterminds bent
on world domination. It turns out
that some of what Gibson rambles
on about is actually true, and a cer-
tain highly placed government psy-
chiatrist (Patrick Stewart) is out to

her life.
Last Thursday
Matalon spoke to a
packed lecture hall
in the VAC preceding a reception
celebrating the opening of her show
as well as the Davidson faculty
show. Students,
faculty,and
Davidson commu-
_ hity members en-
joyed the artist’s
informal nature and
preference for dia-
logue during a dis-
cussion and slide
show of her works.
Refreshingly re-
laxed and acces-
sible, Matalon en-
tertained questions
and comments
about her life and
work during and
after her presentation, when stu-
dents had the opportunity to cluster

out exactly what he knows.

Gibson gives a remarkable per-
formance as Jerry. Patrick Stewart
does powerful supporting work as
amysterious “psychiatrist” work-
ing for the CIA who may be very,
very evil, or sort of good--or some-
where in between.

After we are introduced to Jerry
throughout his ramblings and the
scene is set, the movie picks up
the pace to a comfortable level.
However, the last third of the
movie drags. I found myself
check-
ing my
watch
won-
dering
when it
would
end.
This is
defi-
nitely a
long
one, but
it. %ss
good.
Richard
Donner,
the di-
rector, said in an interview that
the movie was inteneded to be
confusing because that’s how Jerry
sees the world. The confusion we
are presented with comes in the
form of flashbacks to previous
testing of Jerry.

Thankfully this is not the brain
candy that so many other “block-
busters” this summer have been.
Conspiracy Theory is a good, in-
telligent movie where you need to

around the art-
ist to hear her
comments.
For interested
Davidson stu-
dents who
might = shy
away from the
lectures of vis-
iting artists for
reasons of in-
accessibility
a n d
esotericism,
Matalon’s pre-
sentation, was
not one to have missed.

The pieces now showing in the
VAC, though few, attempt to trace
Matalon’s development as an artist
through this decade.

Matalon testified that she began her
sculptures as a way of dealing with
the deaths of friends, a number of
whom have been victims of AIDS.

Matalon’s earliest piece here,
Breast Plate, deals with the loss of
alover to breast cancer. After deal-
ing with the pain of others,
Matalon’s work then focused on
personal issues, specifically a tu-
multuous family life.

Most recently she has moved
from narrative work towards sculp-
ture that deals with wider-reaching
themes. One worthy of mention is
the examination of physical or emo-
tional protection and the futility of
faith in its existence.

Cage-like wire
structures demonstrate
their inability to keep
the viewer away from
that which is held in-
side. This simple meta-
phor is but one por-
trayed in Matalon’s
work that applies to the
world of human inter-
actions.

Matalon’s works
are gritty and real in
their portrayal of
vulnerability and com-
plexity of human rela-
tionships.

Take a break from your doubt-
lessly already busy schedule to ex-
perience them.

The limited number of works
that this gallery can hold is the
exhibit’s.only downfall.

It also includes pieces by
Davidson professors, suchas
those featured above.

G.I Jane makes audience cry,
‘Il am woman, hear me roar!”

Wow.

After seeing G./. Jane last Fri-
day, that was all I could say. Filled
with violence, intensity, and pro-
fanity, (the three basics for a rivet-
ing action flick), “G.I Jane” capti-
vates its audience. I was ready to
sign up to be a Navy S.E.A.L. my-
self. Okay, maybe I wouldn’t go
that far, but I did feel motivated to

do a few pushups after the movie.

“G.I. Jane” is not your basic
woman kicks ass movie, although
that, of course, is part of it. Also
included in the plot is the political
scheming and back-stabbing that
would—inevitably occur before a
woman would be allowed in com-
bat. Lillian Dehaven, a high-pow-
ered, female politician, bargains
with the Navy to allow one woman
to try for the prestigious Navy
S.E.A.L. Program, a program which
60% of men who enter fail. Played
by Anne Bancroft, this dirty
politician’s motives to gain popu-
larity will infuriate you. The pawn
of her game is Jordan O’ Neil (Demi

gence officer desperate for a com-
bat related position. The majority
of the movie shows the hellish
S.E.A.L. training, complete with
physical brutality, emotional rape,
and naturally O’Neil’s struggle to
survive through it along. with the
severe gender bias she faces.

The main contributor to this
sexual discrimination is the mean
and nasty Master Chief, played by
Viggo Mortensen. . Master Chief
displays his sexual prejudice
throughout the movie, but the cli-
max of it occurs when the S.E.A.L.
Trainees are put through conditions
similar to that of a third world
P.O.W.camp. Atone pointhe beats
O’Neil mercilessly until she is left
unconscious and severely wounded,
horrifying the audience both be-
cause. of the graphic nature of the
scene and the tremendous discrimi-
nation she faces. Don’t get me
wrong, though; “G.I. Jane” does
not throw the political incorrect-
ness of women’s restricted role in
the military down your throat. In-
stead, it objectively portrays a
woman who outdoes the vast ma-
jority of her male counterparts in
completing the nation’s toughest
physical and emotional training. At
the end of the movie, even those
who were mocking the concept of a

~—~~Moore),-a_ young, female intelli- “G.I. Jane” are cheering her on to’

finish the eight weeks of miserable
S.E.A.L. Training.

Now, what about the new hair-
cut Demi Moore donned for this
part? Despite the critics who longed
for the lustrous dark hair that she
chopped, shaving her head was a
vital part of the movie. The scene in
which she makes this controversial
move is the turning point of the
movie, because it is when O’Neil
shows the audience and the rest of
her trainee comrades that she is
serious about completing the
S.E.A.L. Program. From that point
on, she just plain kicks all ass, doing
even more pushups and situps than
what is expected of her, assembling
an M-16 faster that you can
say,”enemy”, and all in all becom-
ing a lean, mean fighting machine.
It is at this point in the movie that
you find yourself praying that she
makes it to the end. "G.I. Jane”
confronts an issue that is prominent
in the military today: Can a woman
physically complete the intense
training required for combat? If we

. were living in “movie world," then

women would be a vital part of the
infantry after “G.I. Jane." They
would have no limitations, accord-
ing to the precedent set by the tough
but pretty Jordan O’Neil. As for

‘Teality, we can only wait and see
what women will do next.
