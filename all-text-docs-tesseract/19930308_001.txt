Administration Reduces Faculty Course Load

System Designed to Increase Time for Research and Attention to Students

By Shaye Benton

In the completion of a long
process begun seven years ago,
Davidson College has officially
reduced the faculty course-load to
ten courses taught over atwo-year
time period.

The recent action will com-
plete Davidson’s gradual transi-
tion to the semester system from
the former system based on three
quarters. Immediately after the
change in systems several years
ago, faculty temporarily accom-

Reneges
on No-
Cluster
Policy

By Sally Stone __

For the past two weeks The
Residence Life Office’s cluster-
ing policy has been the center of
campus discussion. Following an
SGA proposal and CCRL meet-
ing, the Residence Life Office has
revised the policy. This week,
Richard Terry, the. Director_of
Residence Life, announced that
tworoom clusters will be allowed.

This decision followed much
campus concern for the lack of
consultation involved in chang-
ing a policy affecting only stu-
dents. The Student Government
Association agreed and endorsed
a letter to Richard Terry at their
meeting Tuesday, March 2. The
letter, written by B.J. Rudell,
sophomore senator, proposed
“limiting the number of cluster
groupstotwoorthree sets ofroom-
mates.”

Alice Spivey, SGA Vice
President, noted that the SGA
"supports . . . inclusiveness,” but
does not feel thateliminating clus-
ters is the way to achieve it.

The issue was again debated
at Thursday’s Council on Campus
and Religious Life meeting. With
Richard Terry present, the com-
mittee presented several reasons
in support of clustering, like com-
patibility of hallmates; the envi-
ronment of friendship and relax-
ation; and the difficulty which
would arise in choosing a single
roommate, rather than a group.
They agreed with the SGA’s con-
cer about forced interaction and
its negative reception.

In the meeting Terry agreed
to review the policy and respond.

modated their course loads from

teaching nine courses per year
(three each quarter) to five and a
half per year.

The recent step finalizes the
adjustment by now requiring fac-
ulty to teach five courses each
school year instead of the former
five and a half courses. A larger
faculty increased by fifteen since
1988 now allows professors to
teach the originally intended five
courses per year.

Dean Robert C. Williams,

Dean of Faculty and Vice-Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs, talks
about the new teaching load in a
recently released faculty handout:

“This is desirable for the College, -

consistent with the teaching situa-
tion at our peer institutions, and
possible in large measure because
of the success to date of the Cam-
paign for Davidson.”

Thechange is designed to give
professors more time to dedicate
to their fields while continuing to
apportion quality time to students.

Faculty members should now have
greater opportunity to keep up in
their respective areas while not
feeling time constraints in prepar-
ing classes. Always committed to
giving students first priority, pro-
fessors can continue to work with
students individually, keep long
office hours, and spend quality
time with their advisees. In addi-
tion, the administration hopes to
be able to more easily recruit fac-
ulty because of the more appeal-
ing reduced course load.

To fulfill this transition,
Davidson must make some adjust-
ments. For instance, the Registrar
will slightly raise course ceilings
wherever necessary. Department
chairs will reduce the number of
team-taught courses. Chairs will
decide which courses in their de-
partment can be. taught less fre-
quently or dropped from the cur-
riculum. Faculty members will
generally schedule their sabbati-

On Track to Spring...

Soccer/Track Complex Considered
by Facilities Planning Committee

By Mary McCrory

The NCAA soccer tourna-
ment, while bringing tremendous
benefits to Davidson and the soc-
cer program, was not without sac-
rifice. In order to accommodate
the dimensions ofa soccer field, it
was necessary to widen
Richardson field. As a result, the
track was reduced from six lanes
to three.

The present track is in poor
condition, and has been for sev-
eral years. According to Sterling
Martin, the Assistant Director of
Athletics and former track coach,
“The surface was put down in
1974. It is a Uniroyal surface,
which is rubberized asphalt. Over
a period of time, the rubber works
itself out of the asphalt.” Notonly
that, tree roots have worked their
way into the track on the southeast
side, along with a lot of standing
water.

Such conditions have been
hard on the track program. Men’s

track coach Gary Andrew com-
mented, “When recruits come to
Baker, it makes an impact. Pres-
ently, our track does not have a
positive impact on recruits.” Ap-
parently, it does not have a positive
impact on Davidson track team
members cither. According to
women’s track coach Beth Manson,
“I think it leads to some of the
injuries we have.”

If the track program at Davidson
is to continue, a new facility is re-
quired. Obviously, the track team
needs an improved practice facility,
but it also needs a place to hold
home meets. Even before the track
was reduced to three lanes, only 2
or 3 meets a year were held. athome
because of the hard surface.

Like any other major undertak-
ing, building a new facility will be
very expensive. There has been
concern that money spentonatrack
and soccer complex will drain
money out of other projects like the
Union or a new science building.

According to Lee Sargent, Assis-
tant to the Athletic Director for
Special Projects, “Money is not
going to come out of any other
project for this project. Period.”

The money required to build
the track will have to be raised by
the Athletics Department. Funds
from the Campaign for Davidson
are not available for this, because

Man
Flashes
Student in
Chambers

By Mandy Curtis
Indecent exposure is not what
a student expects to see in Cham-

_bersat11:00a.m.ona Friday morn.

ing. - However, Freshman Katy
Moore was the victim of this inci-
dent on February 26. While on the
pay phone by the south end of Cham-
bers she was “flashed” by a man
who appeared to be 30 years old.

According to Moore, it hap-
pened while classes were in session
and no one else was in the hall. A
Caucasian male weighing about 160
pounds and standing six feet tall
with dark hair and full beard walked
in the back entrance of the first
floor near the elevator. Moore de-
scribed the “shady guy” as wearing
grey sweat pants and a dark trench
coat.

The man passed Moore while
she was on the phone with her
mother. He then passed her a sec-
ond time and exited the same back
door.

After only a few minutes the
man returned. He walked back into
the building and stopped in front of

_ the elevators. According to Moore,
 itwas then that he opened his trench

coat and exposed himself to her.
He was wearing a black garter belt.
Moore said that he stood five

_ feet in front of her for about five

seconds. Without a word orexpres-
