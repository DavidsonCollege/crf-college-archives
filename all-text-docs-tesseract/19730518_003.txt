Committee Offers Plan 222:
For Faculty Evaluation

By MARK DEATON
Asst. Managing Editor

The Faculty Committee on
Professional Affairs will
present their ‘‘Working
Document on Policy and
Procedure for Evaluation of
Faculty Performance” at the
formal faculty meeting May 29.
according to Professor Max W.
Polley, chairman of the com-
mittee.

“Our report deals with
methods of evaluating faculty
performance including
procedures for initial ap-
pointment, _ reappointment,
promotions, and nonrenewal,
tenure procedures, and annual
salary recommendations,’ said
Polley.

By acting on this document,
the faculty will express its will
in terms of by what procedures
they wish faculty to be
evaluated. This decision will
then go to the trustees. They
will determine whether this
document shall be made official
college policy.

Rather prominent in the
evaluation process as proposed
by the Professional Affairs
Committee is the department
chairman who with the vice
president for academic affairs
will make recommendations to
the Board of Trustees for
promotions and tenure con-
siderations.

Department chairmen would
evaluate members of their
department annually for salary
increment and at times when
tenure or promotion for that
member is being considered.

Criteria for evaluations in-
clude a_ personal interview,
discussion of courses taught,
tests, course syllabi, grade

distribution, research,
publication, professional
meetings attended, papers
presented at professional
meetings, library holding in-
creases, study of graduate
students who have studied un-
der said professor, and student
evaluation.

The department chairmen
and the vice president would
make a joint recommendation
to the president which will or-
dinarily be sent to the trustees.

“This is the second proposal
which we have submitted to the
faculty,’ said Polley. ‘‘We've
been working for a whole year
on this."

The first report suggested
that a faculty committee be set
up to evaluate each faculty
member. However, there was
little support for such a plan
from the faculty.

“I think there's some op-
position to this first proposal
based on the fact that
professors don't want to sit in
judgment of their colleagues.
Most members of the faculty
seem to think that evaluation
should be left to the ad-
ministration,’’ he said.

“The question remains, how
much administrative work do
you want the faculty to do,
along with how well can ad-
ministration evaluate the
faculty,”’ Polley explained.

“‘We’re trying to bring the two
together enough by getting
department chairmen to seek
more responsibility than ever
before in the past,"’ he said.

Professor Earl MacCormac,
a member of the Professional
Affairs Committee prefers the
first plan submitted by the com-
mittee.

EXAMINATION INSTRUCTIONS

The college calendar (as amended by the Executive Committee)
Calls for exams to be taken May 26, 28, 29, 30, 31. Not all professors
use the self-scheduled procedures described here, so each. student
should determine definitely the exam arrangements for each course.
If self-scheduled procedures are used then the following instructions

apply.

Go to the Student Store in Belk Hall and purchase an exam en-
velope for each of your courses using self-scheduled exams. Fill in the
appropriate identification information on both the yellow and red
cards and also on the top section of the envelope. Give the envelope
with both cards still attached to your professor between 8:00 a.m.,

May 18, and 5:00 p.m., May 22.

“Each examination envelope you turn in will be available to you
during each morning and afternoon session on May 26, 28, 29, 30,
31. You do not need to specify in advance when you will write a par-
ticular exam. Go to Chambers Banquet Hall between 8:40 and 9:15
for morning sessions and 1:40 and 2:15 for afternoon sessions and
ask for the envelope containing the exam you want to take at that
time. The envelopes will be arranged alphabetically by the student's

The yellow card will be detached and retained by the examination
staff. Go to any class room in Chambers Building and write the exam.
The envelope with red card still attached and containing the questions
and your answers may be returned to the examination center as early
as 9:45 for the morning and 2:45 for the afternoon.

The yellow card now receipted by the examination center will be
given to the student. Hold that card until a grade for the course is
received. In case of any irregularity it is the student's evidence that
he turned in the exam envelope containing exam materials.

“When the self-scheduled plan was adopted it was realized that it
would be an additional strain on the Honor Code, but it was also felt
that the student commitment would be adequate to preserve that
fine Honor tradition. Now that the novelty of self-scheduled exams
has worn off there is a continuing need for each student to renew his
commitment to the Honor Code,” said Registrar Richard C. Burts Jr.

Code.

‘I think it’s short-sighted to
think that faculty have no part
in evaluation,"" MacCormac
said. ‘‘However, I'm in favor of
our present document as a
pragmatic solution. If that’s
what the faculty wants. I'll sup-
port it.

“There are some 18 depart-
ment chairmen here at David-
son, many of those people
heading three or four man
departments,” MacCormac
said. ‘‘With the personal ties
within departments, it's just
that much harder to secure an
evaluation with constructive
criticism. I'd prefer to see a
committee of faculty do the
evaluations.

Professor J. Nick Burnett.
also. a member of the
Professional Affairs Committee
is in favor of the current
proposal. *'

“I'm in favor of the plan we
presently have before us where
the major emphasis is on the
academic vice president and
the department chairman to
whatever degree the vice
president delegates respon-
sibility to him,"’ said Burnett.
