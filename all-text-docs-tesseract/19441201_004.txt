Into the Life of Things -

By J. S. Blain 5

Several fine preachers have. visited Davidson in the past
few weeks, and Vesper talks made by these men have given
greater insight and inspiration to the students.

Reverend George D. Heaton of the Myers Park Baptist
Church told the students several weeks ago that “This is the
midnight hour when everyone must unmask himself.” This
is the time whengevery man must take sides, and the right

side is Christ’s. Secularization of education must cease, and

all college courses must be centered around Christ. In the
Cross the gap between man and God was bridged, and now it
is man’s duty to meet God half-way, thereby making possible
a happier and better world in which to live.

It was a real pleasure to welcome Dr. J. McDowell Rich-
ards back to Davidson, and his sermon on Romans 1:16 struck
close to the hearty of many who were present. Pointing out
that Paul preached a religion which had originated in a small,
weak country, and even fireached it to the haughty Romans,
Dr. Richards stated that we in our powerful Christian country
have no reason to be “ashamed of the gospel of Christ”.
Though Paul had reason to be ashamed, he was not, for he saw
behind Rome’s grandeur its moral decay and realized that: only
Christ it. All the learning in ‘the world cannot
save the human soul. Only by Christ’s teaching ¢an our world
Every individual must have the inner con-

viction that Kagawa had when he said, “There is nothing
good in me éxcept Christ.” :

On last Sunday evening Dr. Frank H. Caldwell, president
of Louisville Presbyterian Seminary, preached on the “balcony”
and “roadway” perspectives of life. Using Pilate as an exam-
ple of man who stands off and believes, but does nothing,
he urged the students to become committed wholeheartedly
to their beliefs, and to get down on the roadway of life and
participate. [very Christian must “act as a man of thought
‘and think as a man of action.”

This week the annual Gift Fund campaign is being started.
It is the sincere wish of this column that every Davidson man
will be much in prayer for this drive, and that all will contri-
bute to the utmost. We are indeed to in
lege, and this opportunity to memorialize those of our class-

fortunate be col

mates and friends is great. Let us all give generously and

wholeheartedly, with the hope that peace may soon come, and

that those who have paid the great price may not have died in

vain.

wards whipped a bullet to McBride
for 12 yards. After a line buck and
an incomplete pass, Lowry ‘snared
a pass from Edwards and ran to the
1 before Rogers and Akers finally
caught him. McGehee hit Black
on the 2 foot line, and Lasley made
it over. Medford kicked the point
and Davidson led 13-7. For the last

two minutes Davidson held the ball
and ran the clock out.

Both teams were hit hard. by in-
capacitated _ players. Darlington
keenly felt the loss of Yankee's
plunging and Cheatham’s _ tackle
smashes. This constituted through-
out the season the bulk of the Ti-
ger attack. On the other hand, Da-
vidson’s Bryant was not present and
his phenomenal quick-kicking was
markedly absent.
