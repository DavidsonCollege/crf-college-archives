The Davidson College Y. M. C. A. has
been do'ng splendid work not only among
the college students, where its need is
almost if not entirely indispensable, but
also in a large number of mission pro-

jects around Davidson. This mission work | fine work.

Another phase of the Y mission work
is that which is being done at the Meck-

about thirteen miles from Davidson. Reg-

Audience With Talented Voices

Before a small crowd perhaps a hun-
dred or more students and townspeople,
the Greensboro College Glee Club pre-
sented a delightful musical program in its
annual appearance in Shearer Hall last

Thursday night. The variety of the
program, ranging from the ridiculous
“There Was a_ Pig,” by Grainger, to

Bortniansky’s Vesper Hymn, enabled the
clubto present its range of talent, and it
handled each of the numbers in an ex-
cellent fashion.

There was one young lady, well known
to Davidson men, who literally sang her-
self into the hearts of every one of her
listeners. Her name is Gwendolyn Mit-
chell, who has appeared for the past two
seasons before a Davidson audience. Her
rendition of “All for You” and “Villanel-
le” caused the house to roar its approval
in collegiate fashion. Phe richness and

IIE
which the Y has most willingly put it-
seem to be numberless, all are for the
advancement of Christ’s kingdom. With
such a high motive in mind no one can
help but feel assured that they will all
be successful and that Davidson will be
known as a missionary college.

melody of her singing together with her
own personal charm and attractiveness
completely captivated her listeners on
more than one occasion. In addition to
her solo parts, she also appeared with
Mr. Gilmaty Alexander in “L’Addio” and

“Good-Night,” and as the soloist in Bort- |

niansky’s vesper hymn.

The entire program was under the di-
rection of Mr. Gilman Alexander who
contributed personally two well-received
numbers, “Even Bravest Hearts” from
“Faust,” and “Friend o’ Mine,” by San-
derson, Mr. Alexander's voice is a bari-

well it asked for an encore, but he re-
fused.

songs sung by the entire club. The young
