Let Window Painting

Brighten Your Room

By SCOTT DAVIDSON

News Editor
Students walking behind
Belk Dormory at night
have been unable to avoid

noticing the glow of the con-
stantly increasing number of
windows bearing colorful
designs. The work is that of
Ashton Trice, a Davidson
graduate now. residing in
Charlotte.

Trice uses acryllic paints
mixed with water, which he
applies to the windows with
a brush. “His subjects have
ranged from Captain Ameri-
ca to Alice in Wonderland
‘and he .has completed nine
windows so far, with re
quests for eight more.

Trice said chat he painted
he first window because he
was interested in seeing how
polymers work on. glass.

He claims his work is
“completely unaraistic. I do
whatever someone likes, if
I can do it. Actually, I’m
just copying. The only artis-
iie- requirements are re-ar-

‘tioned © that

ranging’ the designs to fit
the shape of the window.”
Mrs. Scotty Nicholls, Di
rector of Student Housing,
called the wihdows ‘‘very
colorful” She — laughingly
admitted that knew. of
no. regulatio forb'dding
window painting, but cau-
students would
receive a service charge if
the designs were not remov-
ed at the end*of the year.
Bw Mosely, whose King
Crimson design peers down
from the third floor, initiat-
ed the craze. He said he
agreed ‘to the idea because
“Ashton suggestedjit and 1
thought it would be cool.”
Alan Baragona, a first
Noor Belk resident whose
window _bears . images of
slithy toves,
momraths, stated, ‘LT was
sick: of everything being so
dull behind Belk. i
“Belk, unpainted, is some-
what less than an architec
tural achievement, Mosely's
window proved what could
be done to improve it.”

Rowland’s Football Stand Attacked;
Popenoe Offering Counseling Help

ED. NOTE: The author of
the following letter is a
member of the Davidson
College Board of Visitors
and president of Shands &
Baker, Inc.

Dear Mr. Rowland:

Today
‘une of haVing to read your
article ‘‘Football Costs In
defensible.”

It reminds me of the pic-
ture that is depicted of you

with the long hair and: the

glasses, and I just think
‘hat you ought to find, out
where the money is coming
from.

it is coming from us fel-
lows who are putting in
money simply for athletics,
and not for anything else;
and if you don’t get it from
that, you ‘are not going to
get it from the other side.

I think you had better dig
in and find out where the
money is developed for
these scholarships and then
write an article outlining
what are the actual facts.

- Thomas S. Baker ‘26
Jacksonville, Fla.

Rowland replies:

“The best information
available reveals that foot-
ball costs |totalled $267,000
annually: that figure applies
to both last year’s “winning
season and to this year’s dis-
mal showing. ;

“Even with

some .of the

I_had_ the misfor- -

-

so-called athletic — schoilar-
ships paid for by Wildcat
Club fund-raising, next year
Davidson will cough up
about—$11:7,000-for—football.

“Beneficent football fans
do--not pay for football.

“And the wasting of such
sums—of -money_when_ other
more meritorious programs
are shafted is, | still! main-
tain, grossly outrageous.

‘Mr. Baker's distress with
Cullum Roger's carricature
of me is amusing since the
same artist depicts our col
lege president: with hair at
least as long and glasses
even larger.

I_ask neither Mr. Baker
nor anyone else to justify
their wearing or not wear-
jing glasses or any length
hair; I wish this tolerance
were reciprocated."’

To the Editor:

One of the serious pro-
blems in coltege-and-univer-
sity Jife today is. the lack
of attention to the person-'
ality needs of the. students.
Suicide is the second most

common cause of death on
the campus, topped only by
automobile accidents; but
those who have studied the
subject believe that half of

the \latter are © ‘concealed
suicides,’ thus, suicide act-
ually Jeads the list.

Dr. Howard A. Rusk of

the New York University
Medical Center’ collected
estimates that 90,000 stu-

dents each year will threaten
suicide, one in‘ ten will make
the attempt. and that there
will be 1,000 actual deaths

resulting. Beyond this, he
calculates that among six
million . students, ‘some

600,000 have emotional. _pro-
blems for which they need
professional assistance.”

The National Institute of
Mental Health finds that
“the factor of human isola-
tion and withdrawal’ ap-
pears to be critical; and the
colleges recognize the ser-
ious problem created by
these ‘‘loners’’ and are try-
ing to provide help’ but ‘ad-
mit (in Hundreds of letters
to us from deans) that they
do not have »adequate solu-
_tions.

This waste of some of the
nation’s finest young people
is intolerable. Since for
every—aciual—death, nearly
a hundred, Have felt so des-
perate as to threaten it,
much light could be thrown
on ‘the subject by learning

what factors enabled the
fortunate ones to work out
their difficulties ‘and keep
going. :

With the help of a friend
who is vitally interested in
this subject, the American
Institute of Family Relations
is_carrying out a nationwide
study of what is being done
and what could and should
be done. We need to hear
from as. many students and
former students as possible
who have faced such a cri-
sis.

What pulled them out of
it? Was it aid furnished by
‘he college or university? or
other Community organiza
tion? or by. a friend? or
religion? ‘or reading? Just
how did they save them-
selves?

We will not publish. the
names of any individuals or
schools; the information will
be handled statistically and

anonymously. If you can
cajl the attention of your
readers to this study and

ask for Wolunteers who will

write their experiences to
me (‘‘personal”) at the
above address, it may con

tribute toward saving valu-
able lives. y

We shall certainly be most
grateful for any hetp you
can give.

known for his supporting

We first realize that Bob-

borer when he climbs onto
the back of a truck during.
a traffic jam and plays
Chopin on a rattling, out-of
tune old upright piano.

Soon Bobby, known to his
past as Robert Eroica Du-
pea, reveals more of his
true character to us. Robert
came from a family with ‘a
heritage of musical genius.

He is a man who is too
sensitive to live in the mas-
ses, where he has tried and
will try to loose his identi-
ty, too realistic ‘to live in an
elitest > world -where music
and excellence’ are man’s
chief end.

The other members of his
family consider their gifts
sacred and use and multiply
their talents. Robert, how-
ever, lives with no purpose

Susan Anspach plays the
young protegee and fiancee

vity and refinement prove
too much for Robert to re-
sist.

Catherine represents a dif-

delicate, cultured, and re-
fined, Robert asks her to go

uncluttered with other peo-

most piercing question.

“Five Easy Pieces’ (which
