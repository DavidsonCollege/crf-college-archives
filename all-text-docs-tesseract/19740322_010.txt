Nil Diamond Support

The Wildcat baseball team
opened the ‘74 season last
week, dropping its first three
contest. As can be expected at
this early stage of the season,
both the hitting and fielding
left much to be desired.

In the season opener against
Madison College, Davidson
sent the leader of last year’s
staff, Joel Tew to the mound.
Tew pitched well but was the
victim of some shoddy play
afield.

Madison managed an unear-
ned run in the first thanks to a
base on balls and an error by
left fielder Allen Alig.

Tew held Madison scoreless
from then until the fifth when
a pair of Madison doubles
produced the game’s second

ithe Wildcats loaded the
bases after two were out in the
second on a walk to Alig and
singles by Mitch Stone and
Gary Pomeroy, but Dave
Ingold bounced to second, en-
ding the threat.

Stone singJed in the sixth,
and after an error by Madison
pitcher Bill Henley, was
driven in by Pomeroy’s single
to left. Ingold then sent Vinnie
Jefferson to the left field wall,
but the Madison left fielder
pulled down his deep drive.

That was it so far as the Cat
offense was concerned. With
the ion of an error on
Billy Todd’s grounder in short,
the Cats went down in order in
the final three frames.

The Davidson defense and
his own wildness knocked Tew
from the box in the seventh.
Two walks, a sacrifice bunt
erred on by Tew, an error
by Ingold, and a single by
Jefferson sieeal four
Madison runs, three of them
unearned.

Ross Manire took over from

Tew and stopped the rally.

Manire finished the game
for the Cats and gave up three
unearned runs in the final in-

ning.

one were highlighted by the
adventures and _  misad-
ventures of Billy Todd in right
field. While making three
errors in the two frames, Todd
also threw out two Madison
base runners.

Despite the 7-2 loss to
Madison, Davidson chances
looked good for the road trip to
Charleston that followed.

Dwight Plemmons and
Manire were scheduled to face
Baptist College and those er-

bulldogs. ;
Dave Ingold led off the
scoring against Baptist with a
one out homer to left center
field.

Mayberry’s RBI single
produced a run in the sixth, as
did Gary Pomeroy’s solo
homer in the ninth. However,
these three runs were not
enough.

Baptist collected eleven hits
and six runs of Plemmons,
five of them earned. Ed
Willengham had a _ par-
ticularly rough time afield,
with two errors, one a costly

one in Baptist’s four run

singles.

Manire’s support in the field
was none too good as errors by
Pomeroy, catcher Mark
Rodgman and first baseman
Weicker were costly. Manire
worked out of numerous gains
and at this point looks to be a
real Cat plus. ;

While defense has been
bad, it should improve.
Ingold has all the
qualifications to do well in
switching from third to second
and Willingham will improve
with experience at short as
will Weicker at first.

Scrummy Cat Offense Moves
Ruggers Past Spartans

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer

Davidson's Rugby Club won
its first game of the Spring
season in a well-fought match
against Greenville, S.C. Sun-
day's cool weather spurred
both teams to an especially
hustling and hard-hitting
game.

Davidson's backs were the
main driving force behind the
game. They were consistently
able to move the ball down
field with well-timed passes
and kicks.

The offensive pressure
provided by the backs was
heightened by the support of
an alert scrum. With each
downfield drive, the scrum
followed closely to maintain
the Davidson push.

The scrum’s hustling led to
a score at one point when wing
forward Ted Ellett fell on a
ball which rolled into the end
zone.

Streaking Dave Kittrell
provided four more points
when he broke away from the
