OPINIONS

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1996

The first week of school is
an exciting time for most stu-
dents. Old friends reunite and
laugh over each others’ accounts
of their delinquent summer ad-
ventures, atrocious internships,
and failed relationships. But
when I returned to Davidson in
August my acquaintances
greeted me not with smiles, but
with frowns of remorse — even
pity. At first, I didn’t know quite
what to think.

Perhaps they didn’t like my
hair or my tan:(I had all sorts of
hypotheses). Curious as ever, I
asked a friend what the heck was
going on. “You’re just not the
saine,” he said. “Whatever do
you mean?” I inquired. “You’ve
lost him!” he said, pointing tomy
slim stomach, Lifting up my shirt,
I realized my terrible mistake.
There was nothing there! Noth-

For the Love of Belly

ing atall! Belly was gone! A strenu-
ous summer exercise program
coupled with a sensible diet (food
not produced on Patterson Court)
had killed Belly. My friends, as

Britton Taylor

killing such an integral part of my-
self. A social outcast, I would sit in
the corner at parties, talking to
random people about marathons,
calorie counts, or fat grams. Yep,

oversized shorts and slid them
over my boxers. Then, with one
hand I held the shorts up, while my
other searched in the closet for my
belt, without which my shorts

long as they had known
me, had nevér seen me
without him. In the
absence of Belly, I just
wasn’t cool.

The -months of
August through Octo-
ber were anything but
fun. I woke up every
morning knowing that
Belly was dead, and it

would surely fall down
to my ankles. For some
reason or another, the
grip on my shorts re-
leased as I was fumbling
through the closet. To
my complete amaze-
ment, the shorts stopped
and dangled around my
waist! I knew right at
this very moment that

made me sick to think
about it. At night I would toss and
turn, remembering all the fun we
used to have with him — shaking
him, squeezing him, punching him,
‘making him dance. The good old
days were over, though, and I
couldn’t help but feel guilty about

I was atool and everybody knew
it. I hated myself, and everybody
hated me. .

I will never forget October
18th, maybe the greatest day of
my life. After a quick morning
shower, I grabbed a pair of my

God was on my side.
Belly was alive! All this time I
thought I had lost him. To find out
that he had been hanging on to his
dear existence for such a long time
made his discovery all the more
special. I hugged him right then
and there, and I promised him I

would never, ever, let him leave
my sight again.

Today, Belly and I are lead-
ing quite a good life. I feed him
several times a day, making sure
I eat extra things (donuts are his
favorite) tomake sure he is happy.
My friends have all gotten around
to liking me again — this only after
I showed them Belly. They had
missed the old me, they told me,
and they were glad to see him
back.“It’ Il never happen again,” I
assured them, rubbing Belly in
sublime satisfaction.

The moral to this very true
story might be more meaningful
than you think. I urge you to come
up with your own, for I feel there
are some things better left unsaid.
In retrospect I can only offer one
bit of advice: Be kind to yourself,
but most importantly, be kind to
your belly.

- Patterns

After being at Davidson for
three and a half years, one begins
_ ] to notice certain patterns that re-

peat themselves daily, weekly or
even yearly. For example: there
will always be areligious scandal
in the spring. You could set your
clock by the furor that will scorch
these very opinions pages begin-
ning in March; you just wait.
Other patterns, however, can be
Observed just by sitting still some-
where on campus and watching
people. Girls will always check
themselves out as they walk by
the mirror in the union cafe. Boys
will always check their zippers as
they walk out of the bathroom in
the Commons. You can find at
least one sheet hanging out of a
Belk window at all times. Seniors
drive everywhere.

Chambers looks a lot bigger
when you’ re walking in to take an
exam. People from the South are
proud; people from the North
don’t get it; and people from New
Jersey seek each other out. 75%
of freshman girls have their first
experience with alcohol at
Davidson, and sometimes it can
get ugly.

Freshman boys look like hell
for most of spring semester be-
cause senior boys make them get
up at 3 a.m. and come turn the
television offin Ryburn. AllPiKA
sophomores and juniors hook up

at senior women’s champagne

party, and any Warner Hall girls
who want to hooks up at senior
men’s party. In the spting, se-
niors all love each other and just
want to hook up with everyone
they see. They spend most of the
semester just celebrating that
their colloquium paper is fin-
ished. Girls in Rich hang out at
PiKA. Girls down the hill hang
out at SAE. Girls in the senior
apartments hang out in the apart-
ment next door or below them.
Soccer players wear a lot of cor-
duroy. No matter how much
work you have, there is someone
out there who is willing to tell
you that they have more. Some
people use CHAL to check out
books, some people use it to check
out who else is in the ‘braire.
Teachers have an amazing way
of assigning things to be due at
THESAMETIME, and then say-
ing things like “you guys don’t
know how easy you have it, you
guys are just spoiled.”
Awesome...thanks.

Weeks come and go, and
semesters do too, but there are
things that have been around
longer than we have, and will

continue to be here after we are | _

gone. They should just make it
part of orientation to teach us
how far behind us someone has
to be before we don’t have to
hold the door of Chambers for
them.

Raising Unconsciousness

You know, sometimes itmight
seem like the injustices of this world
are enough to crush a person.

The Yankees win the world
series, a certain North Carolina
senator is re-elected over and over
again, and the musical genius
Jimmy Buffett goes his entire ca- -
reer without winning a single
award. :

If you can’t stand the unfair-
ness of the world, then by gosh, by
gum, and by golly, you should do
something about it. A

for examplen — to make people
think about those who have to sleep
outside.

When people see young,

good-looking college students -

sleeping on the cold ground, all
wrapped up in their J. Crew win-
ter coats and Eddie Bauer sleeping
bags, they will learn a valuable
lesson:

They will surely say, “Hellfire,
it must suck to be homeless, since
these people will be able to go

sciousness Raised” or.

“I Just Want'to Make Evéry- '*
one Aware that I Don’t Want My
Awareness Raised Anymore.”

If you’ re an active reader, then
at this point, you might be saying,
“Greg, how dare you laugh at the
well-intentioned people who try to
raise consciousness? What un-
mitigated gall!”

My response is this:

What the hell is unmitigated
gall? I’ve never heard of unmiti-

quick and easy way to
feel like you’re chang-
ing things is to start
your Own conscious-
ness-raising cam-
paign.

Pick your favor-
ite axe, grind it in front
of Chambers, and in-
vite others to grind it

What the hell
is unmitigated

gall?

gated arrogance. or obnox-
iousness or even happiness,
but plenty of people say
“unmitigated gall,” I’ve
alsonever heard anyone say
“mitigated gall.”

On top of that, I’ ve heard
of mitigating circum-
stances, but I’ve never
heard of unmitigated cir-
cumstances.

with you. Taking this
literally will make things terribly
interesting for everyone who walks
by, so please don’t dismiss this
language as being pure metaphor.

Here are a couple of examples
of campaigns to give you some
ideas:

If you want to make people

‘conscious of the prevalence of hun-

ger, publicly announce a two-or-
three day fast to empathize with
hungry people.

When everyone sees a couple
dozen activists fasting, they will
realize that at the end of the fast,
the activists will have a good meal,
whereas starving people will not.
Your mission, therefore, will be
accomplished,

If homelessness bothers you
and you think that no one at
Davidson cares about the home-
less, then host a huge sleep-out in
a public place—Chambers lawn,

back to their dorms in the morning,
shower, and put on fresh clothes,
when real homeless people don’t
have squat to keep them warm at
night and really don’t have the
option of sleeping inside the next
night.”

Now, where I come from, we
call this “camping,” and you might
be thinking that that’s exactly
what it is. That’s not exactly true,
though.

If you decide simply to sleep
outside, it’s camping, but if you

- put up flyers about it and make a

big enough fuss, you can call it
“consciousness raising.”

If you like the idea of starting
your own campaign, but you can’t
think of a theme for it, here’s one
that hasn’t been used yet:

“Making the Community Con-
scious of the Fact that Maybe the
Community Doesn’t Want Its Con-

Why, why, why?

“Greg,” I’m sure you’re say-
ing, “what in the world are you
talking about? Consciousness-rais-
ing campaigns about not raising
consciousness, mitigated gall, un-
mitigated circumstances? This is
all meaningless.”

My response to this is, “Yes it
is, but meaninglessness can be
awfully fun sometimes, don’t you
think?”

So whoever you are and
wherever you roam, I can only
leave you one last piece of advice
to deal with your feelings of anger

_ and frustration at injustice and

unfairness.

Lighten up, smile when you
can, watch Bugs Bunny at least
once a week, and buddy up with
José C, a saltshaker, and a couple
of limes,

Chew a little juicy fruit; it’s
good for your soul.
