Basketball beats St. Joseph’s, finishes 4-24

By. BRUCE BALESTIER

The Wildcats ended a season of frus-
tration by sending their seniors out in
‘style Saturday night, roaring out toa big
lead, and easily dispatching tiny St.
Joseph’s of Maine, 82-61. It was a fun
game, and capped a season that con-
tained very few of those.

The five seniors, Alan Hunter, Jay
Schmitt, MoGray, A.J. Morgan, and Jeff
Harris, started the game to thunderous
applause from the Davidson faithful,
and proceeded to dominate the Monks
for the game’s first ten minutes. They

Alan Hunter scored a career high of 30 points last Saturday against

jumped out to an 18-0 lead, holding St.
Joseph’s scoreless during the opening
six minutes, and prompting Giggy
Maxwell, a member of Davidson’s staff
of crack statisticians, to pronounce that
the contest was “a joke.”

And it certainly seemed that way; St.
Joseph’s, a team of NAIA or NCAA
Division III status (no one is sure),
looked horrible, leading to speculation
that a matchup between the Monks and
IMAC A-league champs Mike’s Back
might be more fair. To their credit, St.
Joseph's did begin to look better, but the

AJ. Morgan grits his teeth and kicks up his leg for a
lay-up. Morgan scored thirteen against St. Joseph’s.

‘Cats still led 46-27 at the half.

The second stanza featured more of
the same, and though the Monks
scratched to within thirteen points
twice, the last time with 8:26 left, the hot
shooting and fine play of guards Alan
Hunterand A.J. Morgan pounded them
into submission.

Four points in the final minute by
freshman J.D. Heuer accounted for the
final margin of victory. Morgan fin-
ished with a career-high 13 points, his
first journey into double figures, and
heard roars of approval from the crowd

nearly every time he touched the ball.

Hunter, for his part erupted for a ca-
reer-best 30 points on scintillating 13-17
shooting from the floor, hitting from all
angles in an explosive offensive dis-
play.. “Sweetpea” complemented | his
prolific scoring with 9 assists and 7
rebounds.

Both players had saved their finest
collegiate performances for their final
home game.

It was, as Coach Bob McKillop said, a
“very wonderful way to end the sea-
son.”
