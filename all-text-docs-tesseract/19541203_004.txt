SFC W. D. FRICKS

Sergeant First Class W. D.
Frick, Assistant Operations Ser-
geant of the Davidson College R.
O. T. C. Department, entered the
Army in 1940 at Greenville, S. C.

His first two years of army life
were spent at Fort Bragg, but in
October, 1942, Sgt. Frick depart-
ed for French Morocco, arriving
there on November 8.

After moving through Africa
and into Sicily with the Seventh
Army, Sgt. Frick was transferred
to England with the 60th Infantry
of the Ninth Division. He left
England June 10, 1944, and was
discharged from the army in June,
1945.

Sgt. Frick entered Clemson Col-
lege under the G. I. Bill, but after
one and a half years, he reenlisted
in the army and was sent to
Trieste in July, 1948, as a member
of the 35ist Infantry.

In September, 1952, Sgt. Frick
returned to the United States and
was stationed at Camp Rucker,
Alabama until April of 1953, at
which time he reported to David-
son College.

Sergeant First Class Frick’s
‘awards include the American De-
fense Ribbon, E. T. 0., with seven
Battle Stars, Good Conduct Rib-
bon with Three Clusters, Bronze
Star, and Occupation Ribbon.

year. If Floyd plays all season like
he played the latter part of last
year, when he. averaged twenty-
five points a game, the Furman
team will rate as a definite threat.

West Virginia will count on Rod
Hundley, sophomore sensation from
Charleston, W. Va. Hundley aver-
aged thirty-four points a game for
the freshman team last season, al-
though he refused to shoot in many
games. He is picked as the out-
standing sophomore prospect in the
East. To go with Hundley the
Mountaineers will have a tall team
which is changing from a zone to
a man-to-man defense under their
new head coach.

Not much is known about the
William and Mary team which fin-
ished fifth last season. The team
lost Wednesday to the powerful
North Carolina State five, 111-97.

The lower part of the standings,
composed of V.M.1., Davidson,
Washington and Lee, Virginia
Tech and The Citadel, is expected
to remain in the lower half of the
league with the only difference
being the rise in standings of pos-
sibly the Washington and Lee
team. The Virginia Tech team will
be composed mostly of sophomores
and is probably still a year away
from becoming a power in the
league.

The conference is generally ex-
pected to be tougher all-around,
and if the basketball bounces as
crazily as the football did this fall,
we may find an entirely different
picture when tournament time
rolls around. .

W. F. Will Meet With
Queens On Sunday

A joint meeting with Queens has
been planned by Davidson’s West-
minster Fellowship for this Sunday
night.

The meeting will start with a
light supper at 5:30 in the base-
ment of the church, and then
there will be a discussion upstairs
in the Student Lounge. In this dis-
cussion the group will consider the
possibilities of organizing a West-
minster Fellowship at Queens.

E. T. Miller, Fellowship Com-
mission Chairman, has planned the
transportation and the program
for this meeting. All members are
cordially urged to attend this
meeting,

occured in 1899 when a New York-
er, H. H. Bliss, stepped from a
trolley into the path of a horse-
less carriage and was killed.

his last four games.

Charlie Rankin is another form-
er Fayetteville ace on the Cat
squad. After playing his first sea-
son under Crowell Little, Charlie
sat out the next two seasons, but
he returned to the squad this sea-
son and turned in a top-flight job
at his end position. Charlie did
some fine pass-catching and really
shone on defense.

Last, but by a long shot not least,
is Jim Thacker, the 165-pound half-
back from Rome, Ga., one of the
all-time backfield greats in Wildcat
football. Jim performed in out-
standing fashion for four years,
and in both his sophomore and
junior years he averaged better
than five years per carry. Most
folks in these parts feel that Jim
could play on. almost any team in
the country, and undoubtedly he is
one of the finest backs ever to don
a Cat uniform. This season, Thack-
er often found opposing defenses
concentrating on stopping him,
but it seems they never quite suc-
ceeded. He did a great job as Co-
Captain, and despite an carly-
season injury, he was given an
Honorable Mention on the All-
Conference team.

There are three Seniors who had
a large part to do with Davidson’s
fortunes this season, though. they
did not wear the Red and Black.
Bill Acker, Charlie Cousar, and
Leroy Fargason were the coaches
of the Junior Varsity and helped
a lot with the varsity club, too.
Acker had run out his eligibility,
while Fargason and Cousar receiv-
ed injuries which kept them out
of the line-up.

THE DAVIDSONIAN
BY NINE DAVIDSONIANS

N. Seminar Attended

BY WALTER DAVIS
This past weekend nine Da-

partially settled. War was stopped
in Korea, the lives of many men
being saved. The Trieste problem

vidson students attended the semi- and the fighting between the Is-

annual U. N. Seminar which was
sponsored by the National Stu-
dent YMCA and YWCA, With us
were 100 other students from as
far as Nebraska, in the United
States, and Pakistan overseas. We
participated in a variety of activi-
ties at the United Nations Semi-
ner such as touring the U. N.
building, sitting in on committee
meetings and the General Assem-
bly, and discussing with various
speakers the duties, powers, and
problems of the 60 nations repre-
sented.

One attitude that we discussed
at length is the opinion of so
many that the U. N. is not a worth-
while organization and is not ful-
filling its purpose. The argument
against the U. N. is that it talks
much and acts very little. While
this is partially true, it was sug-
gested that these factors be re-
membered:

1. The U. N. provides the only
meeting ground for nations of the
world to meet together peaceful-
ly and discuss their problems. In
previous years, these same coun-
tries have gone to war over insig-
nificant incidents. Now probably
countless lives are being saved dai-
ly by the art of diplomacy in the
U.N.

2. The U. N. is the only hope
of small countries. Without pub-
lic opinion of suggestions offer.
ed by the U. N., small countries
undoubtedly would be swallowed
up by larger countries and the old
policy of a “balance of power” be-
tween the large countries would
again manifest itself.

Those who feel unfavorably tow-
ard the U. N. should consider the
tension areas that the U. N. has

cure of cancer does not seem far
off now with radioactive isotopes
at the beck and call of science.

Pneumonia today is not the
dread disease that it was twenty
years agd. When a case arose then,
the doctor had to see his patient
three or four times each day, but
today with the new “wonder
drugs” a patient is up and feeling
fine in a few days.

Dr. Robinson was graduated
from Davidson College with an A.
B. degree. His first two years of
medical school were spent at the
University of North Carolina and
his last two at the University of
Pennsylvania, where he finished
second in his class.

Dr. Robinson has been practicing
medicine in Charlotte for 23 years.
His son, Charlie, a junior at Da-
vidson, is a pre-medical student.

raeli and Arabs are two other
areas where the U. N. has had
great influence.

Perhaps the biggest area in
which the U. N. is working con-
stantly is that of economic and so-

cial aid. Few Americans, in our
prosperity, realize the starvation,
poverty, illiteracy, lack of sani-
tation, and lack of modern methods
of farming and technology that
exist over a large portion of the
world. A staggering fact to all of
us should be that 60 per cent of
the earth’s population never gets
enough to eat. The U. N., limited
greatly by small donations, is aid-
ing less developed peoples all ov-
er the world who otherwise would
not receive assistance.

The four main issues before the
U. N.—disarmament, peaceful use
of atomic power, economic and so-

cial aid, and nationalism—wered |”

vividly presented to us.
One point that is often over-

looked received special attention.
It is that the United Nations or-
ganization has no legislative pow-
er. It can only suggest to the in-
dividual nations certain solutions.
The power lies in the governments
of the member nations. They can
accept or refuse the suggestions
of the U. N. Of course there is
some force in mere suggestion by
the U. N. and that is the force of
publie opinion. Many nations have
felt morally bound to comply with
the wishes of so many countries.

Another attitude that was dis-
cussed is America’s prejudice and
superior attitude. We tend to be-
lieve that the United States’ pref-
erences are always superior to
those of other countries and that
the U. N. is falling unless its de-
cisions are favorable to U. S. poll-
cy. In doing this we fail to realize
one of the main functions of the
U. N., that of compromise, the
yielding of certain points by both
sides involved.

The Seminar was a very enlight-
ening experience for all of us who
attended. We feel that the U. N.

Sig Up Hears Christmas Story, Book Review

The regular biweekly of Sigma
Upsilon was held Thursday night
in the Sigma Chi fraternity house
with President Vereen Bell pre-
siding.

Frank White opened the pro-
gram by reading his short story,
“Tell Me a Christmas Story,”

is the only instrument now in use
which can possibly insure world
peace, and that the duties and
powers of the U. N. will be “ex-
panded and improved as time goes
on.”

which described an old shepherd's
narration to his young grandson
of the life of Jesus and what it
meant to the Jews. After a critical
analysis of the story by the group,
Dr. A. V. Goldiere read a book
review on The Personal Disry of
Stendhal, which also provoked dis-
cussion.

Then the meeting was adjourn-
ed for refreshments and informal
discussions. Many of the members
enjoyed talking with Mr. Carl Hol-
ty of the Arts Program of the As-
sociation of American Colleges,
who visited the meeting.
