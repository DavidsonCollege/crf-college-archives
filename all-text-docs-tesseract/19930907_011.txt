Movie Review: Scott McLean

The summer HGVies had an "I wish I hadn't" feel

Before I get down to the nitty
gritty of this week’s article, first let
me say that I hope that everyone
hada greatsummer. Imyselfspent
two months out of the country,
after which time I was eager to
come home, have a Whopper, and
watch some good ol’ American
movies at the local cineplex.

After seeing what the summer
had to offer film-wise, however, I
wished I had done an extended
stint abroad. Don’t get me wrong
now, because I enjoy seeing dino-
saurs run across the screen asmuch
as the next person, but virtually
every cinematic experience I had

this summer ended up putting me
to sleep.

In this bumper crop o’ crap as
Irefer to it, there were a few jewels
here and there which actually man-
aged to maintain your interest
through the entire picture and soin
lieu of a detailed critique of any
one film, I thought I’d just list a
few that I enjoyed this summer.

On the action/adventure scene,
“In the Line of Fire” is a highly
recommended flick. Clint
Eastwood, coming off the enor-
mous success of his multi-Oscar
winning film “Unforgiven,” stars
as an aging Secret Service agent

determined to stop a psycho ex-
CIA hitman (played superbly by
John Malkovich) from assassinat-
ing the president.

This one is a definite thumbs
up. Also, you might want to check
out Sly Stallone’s “Cliffhanger,”
although by now you'll probably
have to wait for it to come out on
video.
Though a lot of the acting is
for the birds, the action is non-stop
and the scenery is absolutely spec-
tacular. In terms of dramas, two
films from this summer stand out
in my mind. First, there is the
biography pic “What’s Love Got

to Do With It” which chronicles
the life of rocker Tina Turner.
Actress Angela Bassett is first rate
as Tina and in the concert scenes
she captures Turner’s energy and

showmanship so well that it’s al-.

most eerie. Look for this one on
video in the next couple of months.

The other excellent dramatic
movie of the summer, which I feel
got knocked undeservedly, was
director John Singleton’s sopho-
more effort “Poetic Justice.” Hav-
ing been nominated for an Acad-
emy Award for his first film, “Boyz
in the Hood,” Singleton perhaps
set himself up for the negative criti-

cism that “Poetic Justice” received.
In any case the movie centers on
Justice (Janet Jackson), a-hair-
dresser from south ceatral Los
Angeles who deals with the pain in
her life through her poetry (written
for the picture by Maya Angelou).

Aconsumer warning though:
if you go in expecting another
“Boyz...” then you'll be disap-
pointed because the film tackles
other aspects of living im South
Central. With that being said
though, I’m sure you'll find it tobe
an enjoyable little flick.

Y’all have a great semester
and I’ll see you at the movies!

building beautifully fits what we
wanted to happen in the program.”

Art History professor Nina
Serebrennikov seconds this notion.
After leaving the inadequate and
crowded facilities on Oak Row,
she says Davidson professors can
now “teach art history better than
any place in the country.” In-
creased space, high-tech lenses on
slide projectors, and the use of
videos and CD players offer pro-

hope visual

fessors much greater flexibility in
their teaching. Additionally, new
classes, such as sculpture, are now
available to students for the first
time.

In addition to having
great technical advantages,
Serebrennikov reminds others that
the building itself is also a work of
art. Like sculpture by
Michelangelo, she believes this
building is also the top of its genre.
“To actually have a building like
this and to live in it is remarkable.”

arts center will boost community

Senior Art History major
Molly Johnson is still getting used
to the dramatic move from having
nothing to suddenly being able to
work in a facility that is on the
cutting edge of technology and ar-
chitecture. She believes the new
center, with its large windows and
airy feel, will artistically inspire
many students. Additionally, she
says the building itself could be
studied as a part of a modern archi-
tecture class. Jackson sees the
Visual Arts Center as attracting

students with more targeted inter-
ests in the visual arts, allowing for
the expansion of Davidson’s Art
Department. Still, he alsobelieves
that the facility will benefit the
Davidson community as a whole.

The center’s two large galler-
ies make exhibitions more avail-
able for the public to enjoy. A
faculty exhibition will be held Sept.
10-Oct. 31. On November 6, art-

ists Kenneth Noland and Tommie’

Robinson will be on campus for
the opening of their exhibitions.

Visitors and students can also en-

_joy the Rodin sculpture, donated

by the Pepper family, permanently
placed in the center’s atrium.

The Visual Arts Center also
containsa lounge, open 24-hoursa
day. This offers a pleasant change
for students used to studying in the
orange and chartreuse surround-
ings of the library. Jackson hopes
that the building will speak. for
itself for the whole community.
“Everyone should be proud of it
and feel like it is theirs.”

Radiohead Offers More

Bands continued from page 10

Vig (semi-famous since produc-
ing Nirvana’s “Nevermind”+ and
singer/guitarist Billy Corgan, who
again exaggerate the changes be-
tween mellow passages and the
funky rock and roll in a way. that
could probably never be duplicated
live.

Only musicians as talented as
these four play such a mixed bag of
sounds so flawlessly. Corgan’s
voice, like James Iha’s guitar, al-

‘ ternates between aseductive whis-

per to a howl. And, as with their
first album, the songs’ individual
arts move along as a cohesive unit
like a good ‘Pink Floyd
song.Radiohead, like the Pump-
kins, draws attention to itself
through the extremes of rock and
roll. Anyone who has listened to
their single “Creep,” with its sud-
den, jarring guitar chops (“I wish I

was special . . . “) understands
what the element of surprise can
do to a song.» Beas
This English band, unknown
to America only three months ago
and still relatively obscure in their

own country, base their sound —

mostly on loud, crunchy guitars
that come in and out of songs. But,
like the Velvet underground (surely
one of the band’s influences),
Radiohead has something to offer
under the distortion — carefully
made songs.Each song on their al-
bum, “Pablo Honey,” is crammed
with the melodies and Thom Yorke
sings each song like “Creep” —
with sincere intensity.

In a way, the newcomers in
Radiohead offer the best of what
sophomores Matthew Sweet and
the Smashing Pumpkins are known
for — catchy melodies and sur-
prises. Still, all three make fine
musicand can expect more succes.
