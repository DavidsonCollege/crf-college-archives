Wekievasy: December ‘10, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Cross country teams finish successful season.

By EDWIN PAGE

Davidson’s mens’ and wom-
ens’ cross country teams con-:
cluded their season in the. cold
“mist Nov. 15 at the NCAA Reg-
ionals on the Furman University
_ campus. The women _ finished
‘ 28th out of 29 teams in the op-
tional meét while the men finished

31st out of 34 teams. ;
While the numbers may not
look overly impressive, it must be
remembered that this meet drew
the best teams from states all
around the Southeast. Also, many
of the teams that Davidson usually
runs against failed to field full

teams and thus were not counted
in the standings.

Junior Laura Fannin, the
number one runner for the women
on the season, once again paced
the Lady Cats over the five
kilometer course with a time of
21:07. Freshman Lisa Culbertson
came in second with a 21:25 and
junior "Morrow Reeves placed
third with a 21:33. Freshman
Missy Willis finished on Reeves’
heels at 21:36. Junior. Karen
Kemerait and freshman Ginny
White finished with 23:36 and
24:24 respectively.

First year coach Gary Andrew

said of the women’s performance,
“We didn't have a great race, but
we didn’t have a bad one either. I
think this team peaked for the
Southem Conference and not this
meet.’

The men by contrast ran a
great race despite running ten
kilometers for the only time this
season. Freshman Jay Clugston
ran his fastest eight kilometers of
the season and senior Greg Fore-
man missed his best 8K time by

‘only five seconds. Junior Chris

Fisher and senior captain Emil
Cekada missed their best 8K
marks by only six seconds.

Foreman paced the Cats with a
time of 33:09, which made him
the 10th fastest individual over ten
kilometers in Davidson history.

Fisher followed him in with a,

34:11. Fisher was the Cats
number one runner throughout the
early part of the season and Fore-

man held down that spot during ©

the latter half of the campaign.
Clugson ran a 34:24 for third best
and Cekada came in fourth at
34:31. Sophomores Bob Cornish,
Bill Hartman, and Jay Barron
rounded out the squad.
Andrew summed up the Cats’
year, “We had a great season. It

was a lot of fun and a good learn-

.ing- experience. Next year the

team will know better what to ex- |

pect from me and I will be able to
set up workouts to match their
abilities better. Everyone on the
team had a great attitude and I
consider the season a big suc-
cess.” r

Cekada also felt good about
the season. “For as young a team
as we were, we performed really
well. We were a little inconsistent
and we lacked depth but we ran
very well our last two meets, and
that’s what we were shooting for
all season.’

IMAC basketball and street hockey seasons start

By JILL BOYETTE

IMAC basketball has. offi-
cially begun with five-on-five
games in both men’s and women’s
leagues.

There are several changes in.
IMAC basketball this year. First
of all, a minimum of ten players is
required for each team roster in
men’s B-league and the women's
league. Secondly, the $10 entry
fee is non-refundable.

Finally, the baseball team will
not be officiating IMAC basket-
ball this year. To solve this prob-

lem, IMAC recruited interested

~-students, faculty and staff mem-

bers who are capable and inter-
ested in officiating for intramural
basketball. As a precaution, we
are requiring that each team pick
two members to be a ref during the
season (as designated on the team
roster). If there is a lack of re-
ferees, we will pool these team
refs and chose them randomly. to
officiate games.

Presently, we have enouglit
capable referees to handle all the

officiating necessary for this sea-

Football wrap-up

By MIKE ADAMS
+ . The Davidson football season
concluded its season with a 51-28
loss to Catawba to finish with a 0-
9 record.
The Catawba game was the
_top offensive performance of the
year for the Cats. Senior quarter-
back Steve Bradley passed for 293
yards, the best performance of his
career. He also had four of his six
touchdown passes in that game.
Unfortunately, the _ battered
_ Davidson defense was unable to
stop the Catawba offense.

A few statistics tell the story of

the Wildcats’ season. Davidson ©

scored 12.1 points per game.
They gave up‘an average score of
45.1. The Cats managed an aver-
age of 222 yards of total offense,
but surrendered yardage at a 464-

"yard clip. Davidson did manage to
out pass its opponents, though.
The Cats threw for 186 yards per
game while holding opponents to
182 yards.

Davidson outshone its oppo:
nents in one aspect of the game:
punt returns. Here, the Cats aver-
aged an excellent 16.8 yards per
return while holding opponents to
‘just over 10 yards per return.
Sophomore Brian Overcash led
the team with a 20-yard average.
Davidson used lots of razzle-daz-
zle on punt returns including re-
verses and fake reverses.

The best performers for the
Cats this season were Bradley and
senior defensive. back Gary
Stewart. Bradley passed for an av-
erage of 120 yards per;game and
threw six touchdown passes.

‘Stewart led the team in tackles
with 80 despite missing playing
time with injuries.

There is hope for Davidson's
future despite the poor showing
this season. This hope lies in the
youth of this year’s squad, from
which many solid performers are
returning.

The two leading rushers will
both be back next season. Junior
Aaron Edwards and freshman

Brian Kelly both rushed for alittle |

over 100 yards this season. Kelly
was very hard to stop for a loss,
losing just three yards on carries
all season.

The second leading quarter- -

back, freshman Peter Hughes,

will also be back. He threw four
‘ touchdown passes this year while —

yielding only seven interceptions,
The Cats also return a good

group of receivers. Sophomore —

Michael Gross caught 18 passes
for an 11.4 yard average and one
touchdown. Freshman Shan Teel
snagged 26 passes and four
touchdowns. Junior Charlie Win-
borne was the leading receiver

_ with 21 catches for 298 yards and

one touchdown.
A strong linebacking corps
also returns for the Cats. Junior
Howard Humphries was the sec-
ond leading tackler with 78.
Freshmen Ken Nazemetz and
Cole’ Thomason also turned in
good years with 63 and 60 tackles,

respectively. Six of Thomason’s —

tackles were quarterback sacks.
These young men should defi-
nitely improve, hopefully enough
to put some numbers in the win
.column in the near future.

son. They have been trained by
baseball coach George Greer, a
certified. official, so they know
their job. Please do not tell them
how to call the game. If there are
any complaints about IMAC refs,
report them to the IMAC office,
but remember that the refs have
the right to report problem
players, too.

Three new rules for five-on-
five have been established. One,
only one former varsity player al-
lowed per team and spouses of
faculty and staff are ineligible.

Two, the clock will run continu-
ously until the last two minutes of
the second half and_then it will
stop for out of bourids,; loose ball,
fouls, etc. Three, referees have
the right to throw out any player
who receives two or more techni-
cal fouls and if that player refuses
to leave the gym, then his/her
team must forfeit.

Street hockey also has a rule
change concerning an inbounds
pass. On an inbounds pass the de-
fender must be given four feet of
space in order to make the -pass.

IMAC sponsored a referee clinic
last Sunday to present this new
rule and to emphasize the neces-
sity of officiating. We hope that
all the street hockey teams will
make considerable effort to ap-
pear for their ref assignments.
Three-on-three play will begin
early ‘next week and. schedules
will be available in the IMAC of-
fice by Friday afternoon. After
Christmas, IMAC will sponsor a
racquetball contest and a swim

_ meet, so sign up in the gym if you
~ are interested.

wrestling continued

compiling a .500 record. Al-
though Sentell has no dominant
moves, his natural athleticism and
combativeness make him an excit-

ing wrestler to watch.

Junior Doug Batcheller fills
the 167-weight class. Although
Batcheller has not wrestled in col-
lege, his strength and varied re-
petoire of moves should CH, him
through this year.

Heinze has done’ extremely
well. in this year’s preseason
matches. In the Winston-Salem
State tournament he placed third;
in the Elon tournament he took
second. Last year he led the team

in falls and takedowns. Heinze
also won the outstanding wrestler
award for 1986.

‘The 190-pound weight class
wrestler is junior Doug Saintsing.
Saintsing did not wrestle as a
sophomore, but started for the

Wildcats as a freshman. Saintsing .

is quick on his feet for a big man
and took fourth in the Winston-
Salem State tournament this year.

Senior Gary Branch returns to
his position as heavyweight.
Branch is from Charlotte, but
spent his summer_at a wrestling
camp in New York and also
worked with James Johnson, a

world class wrestler. He is very
strong and quicker on his feet than
many heavyweights. He started
the season with a preseason sec-
ond place finish at the. Winston-
Salem State tournament.

The team opens the regular
season Dec.. 10 against Winston-
Salem State and the first home
match is Saturday against Barber
Scotia at 2 p.m.

Excited about the upcoming
season, Sentell said, “We're look-
ing forward to wrestling at home
and would appreciate fan support.
Personally, I’m ready to ‘Grab
“em by the face’.”
