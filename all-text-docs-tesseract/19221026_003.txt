D. C. FRESH TO PLAY
'-U. OF S. C. FRESH

The prospect that the Davidson
Freshman football team will have a
good scrap with the University of S.
C. Fresh is almost certain as is seen
from reports received from the games
the University Fresh have played. The
score was 6 to 0 in the game with P.
C. and in the game with the Clemson
Fresh it was 7 to 3 in favor of the U.
of S.C.

Two men who seemed to star for the
U. of S. C. were Klugh, halfback, who
drop-kicked from the 40-yard line and
3oatwright, who ran 30 yards for a
touchdown. ‘These are the facts in the
case but the Wildcat Fresh team is just
as good as the South Carolinians and
are confident they can bring home the
bacon.

@ We are ready for Winter.

@ Ready with a brilliant variety of all-wool
gabardine and heavy weight overcoats.

@Ready with styles that will receive the
enthusiastic approval of men who know

‘‘what’s what.”

@ Our shirts, ties, sox, hats, and caps are be-

yond compare.

A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless

Scenes
By Ibsen Shaw Milne.
Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a

rather prominent senior; he prides
himself on the nobbiness of his ward-
robe; it is his private opinion that he is
a veritable lady-killer,

“Bill? Carroll, his room-mate and a
no less prominent junior; in matter of
dress, his taste is more conservative
and substantial; in regard to his love
affairs the old adage, “Still water runs
deep,” is applicable.

PROTECTIIN

Mack—And | say old top have you
heard the latest method of catching a
girl?

Bill—No.

Mack—Sprinkle a__ little
chloride on the parlor suite.

Bill—Wait a week—go slow.

Mack—Yes, but what I am inter-
ested in now is connecting up with a
real snappy top-coat.

Pill—I presume that you have in
mind some real snappy covering.

Mack—Well I rather guess so.

Bil!—What for instance?

_ Mack—Seems like I crave one of
those new feather-weights in a snappy
light_tan. A*letter from Jack (in the
graduate school at Yale) said that
they're quite the thing around old Eli
and I guess what'll pass muster up
there will make the grade here, eh?

Bill—You said it old top, but where
will you get such South of the Mason
and Dixon line?

Mack—Johnnie was down to the
City yesterday evening and {he said
that Mellon had a nifty line, just in;
Hart, Schaffner and Marx, Hickey-
Freeman and Cooper’s—think that I
ought to find one in that lot.

‘ Bill—Well when we go down I'll
make Mellon’s with you but none of
your fancy stuff for me. Remember
his ad in last week’s Davidsonian, fea-
tured real old heavy-weights in con-
servative colors. One of those kind
that you can rap up in and let the rest
of the world go by

Mack—Together we'll go.(—adv).

College

As father sees it:

A vast laboratory of life where
youth, bright-eyed, flushed, and eager
prepares itself to solve the unsolvable.

problems of the nation and universe.

As mother sees it:
A sort of social paradise where sons

absorb that intangible something
called culture, breathe in the atmos-
phere of refinement from close con-
tact with an intellectual faculty, and
later, emerge learned in the graces and
niceties of life to take their places as
social paragons.

As self-made business men see it:

A huge drunken debauch, where
youth is taught conceit, egotism and
tthe seven deadly sins.

Asjit is:

Chapel, classes, meals, bed, and
movies when you are not broke. A dis-
piriting, stupefying, and endless suc-
cession,

TRINITY WILL BE MET
ON GREENSBORO FIELD

faving gained a glorious victory in
holding the heavier-to-a-man Virginia
Tech team toa tie, the scrapping Wild-
cats have shown what they can do
when their fighting claws are out and
their fanes are bared, and they are
now ready to take the measure of
Trinity’s fast eleven. Next Saturday
Davidson will play ‘Trinity on Cone
Field in Greensboro and as it is the
first game in football history between
the two schools, it has aroused a good
hit of interest among fans of the pig-
skin.

In the realm of football, dope is
never too certain and is frequently up-
set, as was shown in the late game with
V. P. 1. when all the computations and’
predictions of the sages of football
were scattered to the winds. If the
two teams had played in past seasons
there would be some ground for com-
parison.

As dope goes this is the way things
stand. When Trinity played Hamp-
den-Sidney, she won by a score of 28
to O and V. P I, gained a victory over
Hampden-Sidney by a 38 to O score.
As Davidson and V, P. I. tied, this
would give Davidson the odds by 10
points. Yet on the other hand, Caro-

lina beat Trinity by 21 points, Trinity
failing to s¢ore, and Carolina walked
away with Wake Forest by a 62 to 3
score. As Davidson and Wake Forest
tied, this would give Trinity the odds
by 38 points. This need not cause any
undue alarm though, for Wildcat
teams are noted for their capacity as
first class dope spillers and they are
looking forward, blood in eye, to a safe
victory over the Trinity team.
