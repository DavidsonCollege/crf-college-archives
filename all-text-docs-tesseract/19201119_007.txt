So They Did.

The cops at Winston seemed to labor
under the impression that everybody in
the grand-stand carried a pocket X-ray.
But even if the cops didn’t do any good
they did look awful handsome and im-
posing out there in their new blue uni-
forms.

Fresh Davis (“Nappy")—“Hey, De-

“Doc” Delore—“Working for Hadley
Hill.”

“Nappy"—“What's he doing?”

“Doc”—“Oh, Hadley’s settin out shade
trees and Heinie’s settin under 'em.”

The age of miracles is not over. We
have not heard of the lame walking or
the dead being raised again, but we do
know that at least one man had his
éyes opened when “Gig” Shepherd cross-
ed the line. Another man who had been
indulging in vociferous exclamations
was observed to go completely dumb at
the same moment.

We Agree.

Once upon a time there was a fresh-
man who didn’t think he knew as much
as a senior. Luke McLuke would call
this “another damli.” .

Cassell joined the saléesmen’s club. We
are told he wanted his picture in the
annual.

W. L. Roddy—‘“5 p. m—-, I'll not get
up at §-p. m. in the morning for any-
body.”

Jim Boulware and by-standers in-
duige in a large quantity of laughter.

W. L. Roddy (with blushes)—“Oh! you

Erratum.

The magazine management has asked

poem, “To A Little Fairy,” was printed
in the serious part of the magazine by
error. It was meant for a joke—Walt-

draw conclusions concerning many of
the problems that confront us in our
daily life.

Monday Afternoon.

Dr. John Calvin Metcalf gave a very
instructive lecture to the class in Eng-
lish Four last Monday afternoon in
Shearer Hall. His topic was “Literature
and Biography,” and the treatment of
this subject was divided into the study
of biographies in general and the most
famous biographies in particular.

He began his remarks by quoting
Emerson, that every great institution is
“the lengthened shadow of a great
man.” So it is with biography. The
methods of study and the various meth-
ods us€d by the biographers were
brought out in some detail and then
the greatest biographies were mention-
ed with appropriate remarks for each.

One of the most human as well as
most ancient examples of this art is the
story of Joseph and his brethren in the
Old Testament. Next in point of time
and interest comes Plutarch’s Lives,
which humanize the many lives of great
men in such a vivid fashion.

The first modern and typically modern
is Boswell’s life of Johnson. This, ac-
cording to Dr. Metcalf, is the greatest
achievement in the field of biography
in that it gives us the complete man
with all of the little arguments and con-
versations of human interest.

Dr. Metcalf suggested that all should
read Trevelyan’s Life and Letters of
Lord Macaulay and especially learn to
cultivate that most useful practice of
reading by paragraphs instead of sen-
tences, as Macaulay is said to have done.

with a mention of the interesting biog-
raphy, “Life and Letters of Sir Walter
Scott,” by A. G. Lockhart. A few sup-
plementary remarks were thrown in in-
cidental to Dr. Metcalf‘s visit to Ab-
bottsford.

Many other biographies were men-
tianed, such as the “Life and Letters of
Louis Agassi,” “Life of Artemus Ward,”
“Life of Francis Parkman,” and the “Life
;of Nathaniel Hawthorne.

After a few explanatory remarks on
these biographies the lecture came to a
close.

Stowe moralized with the negro, and
Joel handler Harris gave us the real
negro-of the South.

Then came the new comic spirit ush-
ered in by Mark Twain. Dr. Metcalf is
inclined to believe him more as a satirist
and philosopher than a humorist. He be-
‘lieves Mark Twain truly American, as
he so aptly put it, in “appearance, de-
fects, conceit, candor, sympathy, demo-
cratic spirit, and irreverence.” .

DR. MARTIN ATTENDS
SYNOD OF FLORIDA

Dr. Martin attended the sessions of
the Synod of Florida, meeting at De-
funiac Springs, last week from Thurs-
day till Saturday. The Synod seemed
glad to hear of the work of Davidson
and will include her among the institu-
tions of the Church funds for which a
campaign is to begin in the Florida
Synod as soon as it can procure the
services of Dr. Melvin. He very ably
conducted last year’s campaign for one
million dollars for the educational insti-

tutions of the Church in the Synod of
North Carolina.

While away, Dr. Martin assisted in the
dedication of the new McIlwaine build-
ing of Palmer College, Florida. Palmer
College is represented at Davidson this
year by W. H. Sharpe, of the Sophomore
