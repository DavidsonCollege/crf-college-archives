Each Chapter Could Raise
Own Endowment Fund

Some students have suggested
that the individual fraternities help
to raise some of the money needed
to build the new fraternity court. This
is a good suggestion, but one which
is easier said than done.

The administrative problems of a
student-sponsored fund raising cam-
paign would be tremendous, in addi-
tion to the fact that some fraternities
would not be able to raise as much
as others due to the varying numbers
of alumni in different chapters.

However, it would be highly prac-
tical as well as economically helpful if
each fraternity set up an endowment
fund of its own. The earnings from
these endowment funds could be used
to pay the rent of each member, to
re-decorate the houses, to reduce the

regular fraternity dues, or for any
other purpose that the fraternity sees
fit.

Already one or two Davidson chap-
ters have such an endowment. The
college treasurer manages these
funds and invests them in the same
manner that it does the college’s en-
dowment.

Therefore, if the fraternities are
anxious to meet some of the costs
of a new fraternity court, it would be
a good idea for them to set up an
endowment fund of their own. Each
fraternity should solicit donations
from alumni and friends. In this way
each chapter would receive a propor-
tional benefit from the amount of
money it raises.

Five Greatest

A special Senate Committee,
headed by Senator John Kennedy
(Dem.) of Massachusetts. has a May
1 deadline by which time they must
choose the five “greatest” U. S. Sena-
tors whose portraits are to fill empty
niches in a Senate lounge.

Since everyone else has his list of
five, the Davidsonian has compiled
their list too.

Certainly the late Senator Robert
A. Taft of Ohio is one of the ‘‘greats.”
Absolute honesty, his basic moral
strength, proved to be his greatest
political liability. He chose to be right
rather than to be President and bore
the fruits of his decision.

The great “triumvirate” which
dominated the Senate for the first
part of the nineteenth century earns
for its members Clay, Calhoun, and
Webster a place among the “greats.’’

For a final choice we must turn to
the second and third decades of our
own century and point out George W.
Norris of Nebraska. This independent
thinker often disagreed with his con-
stituents but he never sought to be-
guile them. His greatest statement to
his peaple was also his most charac-
teristic: “I have come home to tell you
the truth.”

Like the Kennedy Committee. the
Davidsonian feels that any list con-
taining only five Senators is inade-
quate and perhaps unfair. The selec-
tion might well have included such
men as Lucius Q. C. Lamar. Robert
LaFollette, Sr.. Edmund G. Ross.
Arthur H. Vandenburg, among others.

Good Man Goes

Davidson College is losing another
valuable man in the resignation of
Mr. James W. Jackson, Jr., who for
the past two years has been the Asso-
ciate Director of Alumni and Public
Relations. .

While much of his work here at
Davidson has been somewhat re-
moved from actual contact with many
of the students, Mr. Jackson has per-
formed an outstanding job in con-
tinuing to establish good alumni rela-

tions and in managing the publicity
of the college. He is the man who is

responsible for the newspaper re- -

leases that appear in the hometown
papers of many students.

Mr, Jackson has been particularly
helpful to the Davidsonian. Not only
has he provided us with a few
“scoops,” but he has taken genuine
interest in the welfare of the paper.
We shall miss his counsel.

Subtle, But There

Dr. John J. O’Conner began his
speech in Chapel. yesterday morning
as if he were going to expound’ the
virtues of individualism in a fast-
changing world.

“Change is a law of life.”’ he said.
With this truism we cannot disagree,
and indeed we would have it no other
way. He then. went on to talk about
the African Gold Coast, the new
nation of Gana, the Orientals, the
Latin Americans, and the Occidentals.

We found this discussion quite
interesting, and it served to empha-
size even more that in this world of
ours there are many people of dif-
ferent colors, of different tongues, of
different cultures. and of different
values of life.

But then, in a most subtle way,
and without mentioning any of those
pin-pointing words, he said we must
“get straight this relationship of one
individual to another.”
talk about majorities that “may be
treated like minorities one of these
days.” Gradually, we caught-on that
he was not talking about individualism
and the fact that one group is in-
herently different from another, but
to -the contrary, he was suggesting
that we equalize these differences
and become as one -by using the ap-
peal “the brotherhood of man.”

While we do not wish to open up
the race question—to which Mr.
O'Connor was obviously making refer-
ence—we do feel compelled to say
that “the brotherhood of man” does
not imply equality. Indeed, even
brothers are not equal.

Each group and each race has its
own culture, and instead of advo-
cating the mixing of these groups.
would not it be better for everyone
to keep his race and his culture as
pure and true as possible. Whether
white or black, red or yellow, all
should be proud of their heritage. It
is when one group becomes dissatis-
fied with its background and attempts
to intrude on others that the intruder
loses the respect of the other groups.

We cannot make equals out of
unequals.

Smyth’s Speech And Election Spotlight Honor
System; Hunter Evaluates Penalty Change

(Ed’s Note: Ross Smyth's
campaign speech for Student
Body President had one basic
point—the honor system must
be changed. Smyth's speech
and his subsequent election
gave Davidsonians reason to
evaluete the honor system
and the possibilities for
change. The following is just
such an evaluation by Ver-
non Hunter, a senior mem-
ber of this year’s Council who
has done much study on the
problems involved in sltera
tion of the present system.)

BY VERNON HUNTER

One of the most valuable
possessions of a Davidson
student is the Honor System.
Primarily it serves as an active
force in building strong char-
acter. Any discussion regard-
ing a change should be of
great interest to the Student
Body.

This article presents observa-
tions that come from experi-
ence on the Student Council
during trials regarding Honor

violations and from serving on
a Student Council committee

which had as its function to
study possible changes in the
punishment for Honor viola-
tions.

PUNISHMENT VS. DISHONOR

Discussion of the punish-
ment connected with the Honor
System is hardly the most valid .
approach in evaluating the
System. Recent emphasis on

the punishment would almost -

lead one to believe that we
refrain from Honor violations
because of the punishment
rather than the dishonest im-
plications.

The purpose of the System
is thought by many to be the
protection of the honorable

rather than the care of the
errant. If that protection is
impaired by a weakening of the
punishment. the System is in
grave danger.

MINOR HONOR VIOLATIONS

By lowering the penalty to
anything short of dismissal, of-
fenses against the Honor
System are placed on a par
with the Student Body Regu-
lations. This is far from what
the spirit of the Constitution
seems to be. It would mean
that “mild” forms of lying,
stealing, and cheating would be
considered in the same light as

a drinking violation, The
question arises, is there such
a thing as a minor offense
within the Honor System? As
was suggested in a _ recent
Chapel address, the letter will
not be broken if the spirit is
kept. But once the spirit is
broken, can there be degrees

of punishment?

One criticism directed to-
wards the present punishment
is that few men will turn in
another student who commits
an Honor violation because of
the severity of the punishment.
However, there seems to be
little indication that hesitancy
to turn a student in would
diminish by changing the pun-
ishment from dismissal to sus-
pension.

READMISSION OR NOT?

It indeed seems hard to
severely limit a dismissed stu-
dent's choice of schools by put-
ting on his record that he can-
not be readmitted to Davidson.
The Student Council committee
worked arduously seeking a
means of allowing a student to
enroll in another college and
yet be excluded from re-enroil-
ment at Davidson. It found no
alternative plan that would not
weaken the Honor System.
Eventuaiiy it came to the rec-
ognition that we must properly
face the basic question: “Do
we or do we not want the
student in question back in
Davidson? If ‘we do not, it is
not ethical to by subterfuge
convey that impression to other
colleges.

THOROUGH TRIALS

No one can justify the criti-
cism that the Student Council
doesn't deal fairly with all
cases involving Honor viola-

tions. It is keenly aware of the
sensitive problem intailed in

questioning a man's honor.
Part of the reason that the
trials invariably require hours
of valuable time is that the
Council has but one punish-
ment to give once a verdict of
guilty is rendered. Consequent-
ly with no recource to a lesser

LONG-RANGE ASPECTS
It seems that little opinion

punishment, the Council con-
ducts a case with more thor-
oughness and more drive to
ferret out any and all facts
bearing on the case.

With recourse to a_ lesser
punishment the trend in future
years would be for the Coun-
cil to return most frequently
the lesser verdict, whereas now
the insertion of the suspen-

sion punishment seems to be
aimed only at “special” cases.
This will occur in the sanmie
way that cheap money drives
out dear money.

POSITIVE APPROACH

All this is not a plea for
holding to the status quo. To
the contrary it would point to
the need for a more positive
approach than is now taken.
Briefly, I submit that more
stress be laid on the Honor
System in summer correspon-
dence and in Orientation, the
strong encouragement of pro-
fessors to present uniform poli-
cles regarding papers, etc., and
possibly a Chapel program de-
voted to comparison of our
system to those of other
schools.

New Plan:

Limiting Bids

BY JOHN BERNHARDT

Now that we are criticizing
the fraternity houses, let’s look
at the problem of the sizes of
the fraternities. Don't we need
some self-imposed controls to
keep the. fraternities at the
best possible size?

CHANCE BIDDING

There is a large element of
chance involved in the final
day of rush week. A fraternity
picks its boys, sends its bids,
and then waits to see if it
gets five or thirty-five pledges.
There is no guarantee that it
will get the number it really
wants or needs. So some may
fade. out for lack of members
while others may grow too big
for their accomodations or for
really close fraternal spirit.

One fraternity alone cannot
successfully limit its size with-
out hurting itself, both in the
hurried impressions of rush
week and in the interfrater-
nity competitions against fra-
ternities with more men to
draw from. A fraternity can-
not afford to be smaller than
the rest; so it works to keep
up its size, and in getting size
it loses some of its unity and
outgrows its house.

VOLUNTARY REGULATION

The following is a suggested
plan for regulating the number
of pledges taken in by a fra-
ternity. It has worked on other
campuses, and might be volun-
tarily set up by the fraternities
here to eliminate chance in the
size of a pledge class and un-
avoidable growth in fraternity
size. The fraternities weuld

the possible long-run aspects of
the plan. (Though the role of
prophet is foreign to me and I
don't have access to any un-
usually effective crystal ball,
I would like for us to project
our thoughts into the future
and consider a few things that
are of importance.

IMPROVED HOUSING

Generally speaking, frater-
nity housing is at present in-
adequate. Fraternities of sixty
men and more are crowded
into houses that were original-
ly intended to accommodate
half that number, so the im-
mediate need for more room
is obvious in many cases.

However, the more providing

of adequate space will not
prove to be the panacea for
all fraternity problems at
Davidson. If the added space
is given simply to allow the
chapter now present on cam-
pus to absorb the increased
number of students as our en-
roliment moves upward, then
I think we would be departing
from rather than progressing
toward the ideal fraternity
situation. So, in the long.
range plans for the fraternity
system, I think we should in-
clude the establishing of addi-
tional chapters on campus to
ment the ever increasing de-
mands on fraternities in future
years and build a court with

this anticipated expansion in
mind.

To many men, the fraternity
is the center of social life
during the college career. In
houses of the size proposed, as-
suming the inclusion of base-
ments for use as game or chap-
ter rooms, the brothers would
have a suitable place to bring
dates for informal entertaining,
ample room during rush week
and plenty of room for just
plain “goofing off.”

BETTER SOCIAL LIFE

In short, I feel that with the
new, enlarged houses the rela-
tionship of each man to his

agree on the number of pledges
each might take, say twenty.
At the end of rush week each
fraternity would list its twenty
first-choices for pledges, its
twenty second-choice pledges,
and it's third-choices. Each
freshman would list in order
his first three choices of fra-
ternities. The LF.C. would
compare the lists and distri-
bute the boys according to
some set rules. Thus, if a boy
listed X as his first choice and
-X listed him also as first choice,
he could then be pledged to X.
The distribution when the first
choice did not coincide would
have to be decided, but prob-
ably if a boy picked X first and
X picked him second, he would
be pledged by X if it did not
already have its quota of twen-

ty from its first choices.

REORGANIZE SYSTEM

Although this proposal at
first seems. radically different,
it is really no more than better
organization for the present
system. Fraternities at present
bid boys who are not their
first choices in order to be
sure they get enough; under
the proposed arrangement fra-
ternities would not have to bid
boys they did not want. The
fraternities would establish this
system, and might change it
as they saw the need.

The size of the fraternities.

should be controlled to protect
the little ones, make the bigger
ones more united, and justify

fraternity would be greatly en-

and the chief means for meet-
ing one’s need for a_ social
outlet. The adequate lounging
room, the advantage of a house-
mother whose sole concern is
caring for “her boys,” and the
better facilities afforded for
social life will add to the fra-
ternity at Davidson something
that has been to a great de-
Sree lacking — a closer-knit
brotherhood and an atmosphere
conducive to some of the in-

tangibles that are of great
value in fraternity life.
