The Davtdsonian

Thirteen

Ellett recalls Davidsonian bloopers

By BILL ELLETT

Four years of life at David-
son. Four years of life on The
Davidsonian. Is there really
any difference?

“The Davidsonian, a weekly
student newspaper, is edited,
written, and managed by
students. The Davidsonian has
received an All-American ra-,
ting by the Associated College
Press seventeen times since
1951.”

So I read in my brand new
college catalog during a spare
moment the third long night of

I impressed. Gee, do you sup-
pose I could work on something
as good as that? I wondered.

That Thursday they bring a
copy right to my door. 6 pages.
Boy, was I impressed!

Sunday I go to my first staff
meeting. I meet one of the
editors! My first meeting with
a REAL Davidson V.I.P. Boy,
was I impressed.

Four years. pass. The
Associated College Press
ratings came today. We just
missed All-American again. It
figures. Well, at least Buck
won’t have to re-write the
catalog next year.

Someone says ‘‘Was there
really a paper last week? They
never delivered it.’’ It figures.

I go to the office. Deaton
grunts a greeting as I walk in.
Someone else farts. It figures.

Virgin lovers

Between the two extremes
are four years. Much happens.
The paper goes from 6 pages to
16. Our printer goes offset and
carries us with him. I go from
one evening a week on the paper
to every evening on the paper.
The staff box goes from 2 to 3
columns wide. My GPA drops.

But what will I remember
about The Davidsonian?

I try my hand at headline
writing with a story on the mid-
winter’s pop film, ‘‘Love
Story’’. Money-Loving Com-
mittee Looks for Lovers with
‘Love Story’. That Thursday I
look for my headline in the
paper. Somebody had changed
it.

The next week I write Virgins
Crawl On Stomachs As

Spelunkers Explore Caves.
They run it!

I work on the lampoon. Sperm
Bank. You mean they let you
print that?

_I go to the print-shop for the
first time. No one cuts their
fingers off on the buzz saw.

Tanner makes a headline on
the Ludlow. Liquid lead spews
out on my leg.

My third lampoon. What do
you mean my story isn’t funny”

I nurse a sick computer until 3
in the morning. The next day I
sleep through a review.

The 146 mile retirement

I decide to semi-retire for my
last term. The first week back,
the computer goes out, and I put
146 miles on my car from Wed-
nesday supper to Thursday
breakfast going back and forth
between Davidson and
Mooresville.

We consider locations for the
new union. Rich Wilson
suggests the open space just
south of Johnston Gym.

The week of my 100th issue, I
open the paper and unex-
pectedly find an edit about me
on page 4. On page 5, a stray
piece of Bandwagon has fallen:
on the middle of the page.

Earle writes a cutline for a
picture of the retiring tennis
coach. ‘‘Fogleman--to be
replaced.’’ Two days after the
paper comes out, Fogleman
dies suddenly.

Hawk, Snake, Gobble: is this

Orwell’s Animal Farm?
Someone says one reason he’s

glad he works on The David-:

sonian is that it gave him the op-
portunity to know me. The next
week he quits the paper.

Lesbian shot

‘My copy read that Harvard
was the last bastion, not
lesbian. Who does your
proofreading?”

A columnist complains in
print that whoever wrote the
headline on his last story is a
complete fool. I carefully say
nothing.

/'The linotype operator sets
“shot” for “shit”. In correc-
tions, he makes it ‘‘shut’’. Then
it comes out as ‘‘shoot’’. At last
he leaves for the day and
Taylor, the owner, takes over

“Gee. do vou suppose I could work on something as good

as that:

the machine. ‘‘Shit” flies out of
the machine on his first try.

The gung-ho new editor sleeps
through his first staff meeting.

The light table breaks.

We carefully cover up part of
our “‘streaker’’ picture.. Then
we see the Amherst paper.
They covered the eyes!

Hawk runs two full pages on
what a good job Sam Spencer is
doing as president.

The Davidsonian endorses
Ralph Peeples for (SGA
president and swarms of
students protest. Peeples wins.

The Davidsonian endorses
Blain Butner for SGA President
and three students protest. But-
ner wins.

I drink three bottles of Lift
simultaneously.

Four of us gather round the
typist to translate the doctor’s
handwriting of the dynamic duo
C.A. & Y.B:

The national media focus on
Sam Ervin’s speech at David-
son, and The Davidsonian repor-

ter, Malingering Maloy, sleeps
through the entire evening.

We mis-spell Erwin Lodge
“Ervin’’ on all the invitations to
the staff banquet.

The partv’s over

The Davidsonian throws a
staff recruitment party. and not
a single new face shows up.

I get to sleep early for once on
a Wednesday night and Wassen
wakes me up at 4 in the morning
to come fix the #?/!* machine.

Wilensky argues un-
successfully for an edit op-
posing college censorship of
student publications. Two
weeks later, the college censors
Quips & Cranks.

Copy:

I have to interview represen-
tatives of The Peace Corps
because the freshman reporter
doesn’t show up. I get my only
page 1 byline. The absentee
reporter goes on to become
Editor Michael Tanner.

We get an awful first story
from a new freshman. It has to
be re-written. The freshman
grows up to become Editor
Mark Deaton.

—Leon Venable

I let a female reporter’s name
be mis-spelled and she almost
attacks me.

The good Shepherd runs the
exam regulations box twice in
the same issue.

Lame-ass and Mimms?

Gordon Widenhouse writes a
story. Hoon asks how long it is
and I reply ‘‘214 yards.”’
