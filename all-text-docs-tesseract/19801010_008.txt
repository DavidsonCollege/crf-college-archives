Sports

Hockey beats 2 club teams

' By ANNE HOCKETT
Staff Writer

The Davidson field hockey
team exhibited excellent team
play last Saturday as they
defeated the Charlotte Flickers
and the UNC-Chapel Hill Club
team. ;

Courtney Hall scored her
second goal of the season a-
gainst the Flickers bringing the
score at the half to a 1-1
stalemate that continued
throughout regulation time.
Davidson monopolized the two
overtime periods (7:30 each)
that followed. —

Carol Heppner scored an
,awesome goal as the second
period opened. Receiving the
ball off a ‘‘corner drive,’’ Hepp-
ner redirected her hit. to the

opposite goal corner ‘‘so quickly
their defense couldn’t touch it,”
according to teammate Amy
Crittenberger.

With less than 3 minutes to
go, Cathy Inabnet flicked the
final goal to wrap up the
Davidson victory.

The UNC-Chapel Hill Club
game was all Davidson’s as
Carol Heppner scored to leave
the half at 1-0. Cathy Inabnet
brought the total to two goals
as her aggressiveness in the
circle paid off.

The team goes on the road
this weekend to play Duke
(Division I) on Friday and East
Carolina (Division II) on Satur-
day. The next home game is
Wednesday at 4:00 when the
Cats meet High Point.

Frosh soccer star came to get rounded

By TOM PAFFORD

Bruce Springsteen would be
an interesting character to get
to know. How can a man that
puts out raucously refined rock
and roll turn around and sing a
lucsiously lulling love song with
the same intensity? He evident-
ly understands being ready for
the situation. .

An interview with Chris Rob-
erts gives one an analogous
experience. He has never jam-
med before 18,000 people in the
Garden, but he turns in scintill-
ating performances for David-
son’s soccer team leading the
team and currently third in the
conference for scoring. He
transfers this intensity to an
unassuming but confident life
off the field.

Chris is from Schenectady,
New York, one of the more
soccer-oriented areas of the
country, where he took up the
game in the fourth grade. While
at Niskayuna High School he
set school records for scoring
and was chosen. to play in the
Empire State Games, a sort of
summer all-star tournament.

On a trip south, he visited
Duke, William and Mary,
Washington and Lee and Dav-
idson, checking with the soccer
coaches at each one. The
coaches generally expressed in-
terest, but he was not subjected
to any high pressure recuiting.
Davideon was his final choice
for academic reasons and the
low pressure soccer program.
He had met and corresponded
with the then-coach Kremser,
but was not shaken when some
players expressed doubt about
returning when Kremser was
fired. On-Roberts’ door is a

from Sports Illustrated

quoting Coach Kremser—‘'‘I
thought the school had a com-
mitment to soccer, but that
wasn’t the case...its emphasis
was on academics.”

Precisely the quality of Dav-
idson which seems most satis-
fying to Chris Roberts is the
good perspective he sees toward
both sports and academics, the
Athenian idea of good measure
in all parts of life. He finds a
healthy emphasis on winning
but doesn’t feel pressured about
scoring. Davidson life seems a
little slow (a geriatric foxtrot to
some folks), but he finds this a
boon for academics.

This isn’t to say his life lacks
competition. Chris finds the
soccer and the classes more of a
challenge, but he is free of the
pressure in high school when he
felt like his team’s fortunes
depended on his scoring. Here
he says that he may still have a

“knack” for getting the ball in
the goal, but his teammates are
just as talented as he is. He
pointed td his assists in the past
few games as evidence of his
maturation as more well-round-
ed player.

Roberts is fairly pleased with
the season so far. He feels
better and more intense since
the competition has become a

little stiffer in the thick of the

season.

Overall, Chris is optimistic
about the next four years. It
affords him some team contin-
uity which he didn’t have in
high school, and an environ-
ment conducive to accomplish-
ing more than proficiency with a
soccer ball. His confidence in
Davidson's ostensible commit-
ment to the total individual
meshes nicely with the unas-
suming confidence that Chris
Roberts seems to possess. —
