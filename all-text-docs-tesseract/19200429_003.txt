MR. McMULLEN
ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.

Mr. McMullen, of China, intro-
duced his Y. M. C. A. speech by say-
ing that the “peace” which the quar-
tet sang about and which we have
been struggling for for years, will
not be attained until we cease seek-
ing a man-made peace and strive for
one founded on the principles of
Jesus Christ.
great need for Christian business
men, lawyers and doctors, as well as
for ministers and missionaries. The
speaker then discussed the excuses
advanced by shirkers and showed
that the testimonials of all who
have given their lives to Christian
service amply prove that such a life
is eminently worth while. Mr. Mc-
Mullen held the close attention .of
the audience and all present felt
greatly benefited by his talk. —

STUDENT BODY ASKS
DR. RICHARDS TO
REMAIN AT DAVIDSON

The threatened loss of Dr. Rich-| preachers fell-to the eats, at the big

ards has set the students of David-
son College to thinking of the seri-
ous difficulty of ever getting another
pastor who could in any measure
take his place.

The student body has accordingly
drawn up and presented to Dr. Rich-
ards the following resolution:

“Whereas, the services of Dr.

timable in value, both to this institu-
tion and to the students collectively
and individually—

“Be it resolved: That we, the
students of Davidson College, do
hereby express our gratitude and
appreciation to him and our sincere
hope that he will see fit to continue
his work among us.”

need any half-way men at all.” “If
in my own territory I went to visit

around about once every seven or
eight years.” Another = striking
statement which he made was that
every medical missionary had over
1,000,000 people to administer to.

The speaker advised the men to
take all the practical courses and
studies that they could while they
had the chance, as every bit of it
would be needed.

He closed by inviting all those
who really wanted to tackle a man-
size job to come out to China.

MINISTERS MAKE MERRY.

“T'll say they did,” said the report-
er, after seeing the way the hungry

feed (even though no chicken was
present).

The repast took place in the Col-
onel’s classroom, and judging by the
noise which escaped through the
windows, one would have supposed
that an army of “shavetails” were
drilling their companies within.

GYMNASIUM FOR
MILL CHILDREN

The Mill Sunday School is quite
elated over the new playground
equipment provided by Dr. Monroe
and his associates. A considerable
quantity of open-air gymnasium
equipment, such as is found in city
parks, has been receiyed. The ap-
paratus consists of swings, steel lad-
ders, flying rings, and a modern
“Fun Ful” (chute). The little folks
are finding the gymnasium very in-
teresting, especially the chute.
