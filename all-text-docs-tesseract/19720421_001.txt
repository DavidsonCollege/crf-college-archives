Tenure System Receives Criticism

By BILL GIDUZ
and PHIL BISHOP

(This is the first in a series
of three articles dealing with
the issue of faculty evalua-
tion and tenure.)

Great criticism has been di-
rected toward America’s  col-
leges and_ universities lately
concerning the issue of tenure
for professors.

The guidelines for tenure
were set up by the American
Association of University Pro-
fessors (AAUP) and most insti-
tutions acceded to those guide-
lines years ago with no trouble
arising until 1ecently.

The campus unrest of 1968-
1969 which questioned in part
curriculum and staff was the
first major manifestation of dis-
agreement with the tenure sys-
tem.

According to the dissidents,
tenure causes stagnation of in-
stitutions by keeping out new
ideas and people.

It appears that their criticism
is justified in many cases, but
it’s not because of the tenure
system on paper; rather it is
the perversion of that system
when put into practice.

Many people, students includ-
ed, seem to feel that once a
professor is tenured, he is set
for life. It has been stated that
tenure protects against every-
thing except ‘‘death, retirement,
or assassinating a member of
the board of trustees.”

Unfortunately, tenure has been
twisted into just such a_ bul-
wark of invincibility. In prac-
tice, tenure has often protected
incompetent or _ intellectually
Stagnant professors from evalu-
ation or dismissal.

According to the AAUP rules,
tenure is no guarantee of life-
time employment; it is merely
a guarantee of academic free-
dom. Proponents of the tenure
system say that this academic
freedom will benefit the insti-
tution and therefore society as
a whole.

In the March issue of ‘‘Civil
Liberties” Robert Bierstedt and
Walter Metzger state that, ‘‘ten-
ure guarantees to its society
that its more articulate mem-
bers will be free to critcize its
institutions without fear of eco-
nomc reprisals.”

A tenured professor is free to
espouse his views on academic
matters without fear of censure
by his college. He may, how-
ever, be fired at any time when
adequate cause is given for his
dismissal.

Herein lies much of the con-
troversy over tenure, because
‘“‘adequate cause” means only
that the cause cannot be aca-
demic in nature. Therefore it is
an ambiguous and murky term,
and each institution determines
its own meaning.

Most often ‘‘adequate cause”’
is interpreted as criminal viola-
tion, moral degradation or an
extraordinary financial — situa-
tion.

Being so hard to define, most
institutions have chosen not to

try to define it clearly and give
professors almost unlimited free-
dom.

If the institution does feel that
it has adequate cause to dis-
miss a faculty member, he must
be given a full hearing. The in-
stitution must prove his guilt;
he is not required to prove his
innocence.

Professors uSually are given
tenure automatically after sev-
en years service at a university.
Until that time they are under
one or two-year probationary
contracts.

During their probationary pe-
riod, professors are evaluated
according to AAUP standards
of research, teaching and uni-
versity service. The renewal of
their contract is considered in

light of their performance in
these areas.

One criticism of tenure is that,
during this probationary period,
professors may feel stifled in
their academic freedom because
they don’t want to jeopardize
their chance of being rehired.

AAUP policy recognizes this
lack of freedom on the part of
probationary professors and says
that they must depend ‘“‘primar-
ily on the support and under-
standing of faculty colleagues,
administration, professional or-
ganizations and the AAUP for
job security.

As a warning and hint to
young professors, the guidelines
assert that the junior faculty
member must take special care
not ‘‘to introduce into his teach-

ing controversial matter which
has no relation to his subject.”

William Van Alstyne, chair-
man of the Committee on Aca-
demic Freedom and Tenure of
the AAUP, said ‘‘academic
freedom of non-tenured faculty
will necessarily have been more
constrained given the fact that
he has continued to face the
prospect of non-renewal with-
out demonstration of adequate
cause.” No hearing is required
to explain to a professor on pro-
bation why his contract is not
being renewed.

A second criticism involves
the problem of a professor’s per-
sonality in the renewal of a con-
tract. However, many respond
to this criticism by saying that

Registrar Explains Computer Procedure
For Making Course Selections Next Year

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

In response to much confu-
sion concerning the new com-
puterized registration system,
Registrar Richard C. Burts Jr.
gave an in-depth explanation of
the mechanics of the plan.

Burts described what proces-
es will take place after each
student has returned his six
preference cards. .

“After all the cards have been
key punched with the student’s
alpha number and the identifi-

_ cation of the particular course,

the computer will draw up a
random order in which each stu-
dent’s stack of cards will be
processed.

‘A random order will be~ob-
tained for each class,” Burts ex-
plained, “and all the cards will
be run through the computer,

first seniors, then juniors, then
sophomores.

‘We have it set up so that the
first time through, every stu-
dent gets one of the high rank-
ing courses in his deck,” said
Burts. ‘

In other words, the computer
first runs through every stu-
dent’s group of cards, giving
each his first choice if that class
has not yet. been filled.

If a student’s first choice has
been filled, the computer imme-
diately gives that student his
second choice, if it is mot yet
filled.

According to Burts, it is high-
ly improbable that a student
will not get either his first or
second choice. ‘It has been our
experience in the past that usu-
ally seniors, juniors and sopho-
mores get the courses they
want,” he said.

A LAZY AFTERNOON OF STUDY
Students take advantage of warm days this week to soak up the rays.

After the computer has fin-
ished giving every student a
course in this manner, it will
run through the entire list
again to assign each student a
second course, and then once
more for the third course.

Burts said that it had not yet
been decided what would be
the order of consideration on
the second and third runs, but
he remarked, ‘‘We may reverse
the first order, or, if it would be
feasible, we may draw up a
new random order for each
run.”

Burts went on to explain that
after the first run, the com-
puter would determine whether
a student would be granted his
subsequent choices based on
both the course ceiling of those
choices and the hours of classes
which the student had already
secured.

‘We're estimating that the six
choices submitted by each stu-
dent will assure him of getting
registered for three courses, tak-
ing into consideration either of
these conflicts,” Burts added.

“If we find that a_ student
comes up with less than three
courses after all his choices
have been considered, we’ll send
him more cards for several ad-
ditional preferences,” he  ob-
srved, but went on to say, ‘‘This
possibility is highly theoretical
since it’s so improbable.”

Burts expressed his desire
that students will ‘“‘really put
down their true preferences and
not try to beat the system.

“If a person doesn’t get a
course he really needs in the
diawing, there’s a good chance
that he can pick up the course
during the drop-add period,” he
continued.

“If this is unsuccessful after
a few days, the student may
take his case to the department
chairman of the course in ques-
tion. It will be up to his judg-

ment whether or not the ceil-
ing can be broken.”

Burts suggested that courses
a Student is assured of getting
into, such as Humanities, be
placed as the third preference.
‘Beyond this, there’s the possi-
bility than a student may sched-
ule himself out of courses he
needs to be in,” he said.

“This system is of course
more impersonal than the oth-
er,” continued Burts, ‘‘but we
want to emphasize the personal
part of advisement and setting
preferences. The whole system,
I think, hinges on the adequacy
of advisement.”

The SGA Senate this week
passed a resolution opposing the
new plan on the grounds of stu-
dent dissatisfaction and the com-
plication of the computerized
system.

Junior Senator Bill Roland
enumerated his objections to
the plan, emphasizing that ‘‘stu-
dents make decisions about
schedules based on much more
complicated criteria than can
be expressed in a list of six
courses.”

He noted that “Often what a
student chooses for his second
and third courses depends on
what his first choice is, so these
must be flexible. The computer
is not programmed to give a
student a_ balanced schedule,
but one which is merely three
separate courses.”
