Last Tuesday, Ann Harriot Fisher ’99 and
Chris Tuttle’99 ended their term as Student Gov-
ernment Association president and vice president,
respectively. —

Under the Fisher/Tuttle administration, the
SGA has worked to improve the Union Cafe,
enhance trustee-student communications, help re-
vise the sexual misconduct code, expedite the switch
to the OneCard system, address student concerns
after the so-called “flier incident” with a forum on
race, and form the Lights Out Committee, which
fought to keep Chambers open and negotiated the
compromise of a 24-hour accessible Union. These
are just a few of the past year’s achievements.

At the close of Tuesday’s meeting, Fisher and
Tuttle commented briefly on their term in office.
Tuttle spoke first, thanking the senators for their
hard work, a sentiment later echoed by Fisher in her
address. “I want to challenge you to keep in-

volved,” Tuttle concluded. In her address, Fisher *

said that the SGA has “changed this institution for
the better,” citing its accomplishments over the
past year.

Both Fisher and Tuttle said that they were
satisfied with their term. “We can always -have
done more,” said Tuttle, “but I’m satisfied.” Fisher
agreed, saying that she was very satisfied with the
SGA’s. small achievements, but “I don’t think
anyone can be satisfied with big issues like finan-
cial aid.” Tuttle is most proud of the SGA’s “quick

been a member of the Student Executive Commit-

_ tee (SEC), a member of the Student Conduct Coun-
cil, the Chairperson of the Auxiliary Services Coun-
cil for two years, and the president of his class for
three consecutive years. He is also currently a Hall
Counselor on Ist East Belk. When asked about his
experience in SGA, Haselden responded, “it’s
helped me to know the student body, to know the
parliamentary procedure, and to know the methods
necessary to achieve goals, It has shown me how to
get things done and get tangible results.”

During his term as SGA president, Haselden
said that his primary objective is “to work towards
answering any questions or solving any problems
that students have. That way (we) can make
Davidson better .as a whole, whether that be in
auxiliary services, academic. concerns, or ques-
tions of diversity.” Haselden plans to respond to
student problems and interests, and he emphasized
that he is interested in achieving substantial results.
For example, he hopes to pursue any resolution that
has been approved by the SGA Senate. “In previ-
ous semesters, the SGA has passed several resolu-
tions that are sent to the faculty or administration,”
he said. “Yet, the SGA must push and persuade the
proper authorities to recognize and respond to
these requests for changes. Just passing a resolu-
tion is not enough; it must be seen to completion.”

Haselden’s reasons for running for SGA presi-
dent stemmed from his interaction with others at
Davidson/and his devotion to the College. “I’ve
always gotten the idea or motivation to do some-
thing because one of my friends had a problem,” he
said. “I think that’s what SGA and representative
government is all about. SGA is a service because
you’re elected by your friends to do what they ask
of you.” He later continued by saying, “Davidson
has given me so much. Ever since I got here as a
freshmen, I felt so fortunate to come here. Serving
on the SGA and trying to help my friends and help
my school is a way to give back to Davidson.”

the SGA’s success in the celebration of Martin
Luther King Day this year and getting other
organizations involved in diversity issues as the
SGA’s greatest accomplishment over the past
year, ~-

were what they found most difficult. “I was
really afraid there was going to be a lot of anger
(at the SGA meeting),” said Tuttle, who now
believes he “underestimated the students.”
Fisher and Tuttle cite their “outstanding
help” as one of the keys to the success of their
term. According to Fisher, she and Tuttle were
able to rely on “some excellent senators,” includ-
ing newly elected SGA president Foster
Haselden’00 of the Auxiliary Services Commit-
tee; Rives Moore’99 of the Trustee Committee;
Travis Barton’00 and Lindsey Vagt’01, who
handled the Vamanos Van; and Laura
McDonnell’01 of the Elections Committee.
Another aid to their successful term was
that “it was more of a partnership (between
Tuttle and 1),” said Fisher. At the same time, she

students should approach SGA representatives
with not only problems but also possible solu-

As for the

and Tuttle have
great faith in the

Haselden and vice

Tuttle commented
that both students
