Davidson’s Unity Church has
been very active in the past few
weeks working on new and varied
projects. Among these are a re-
cently completed eye clinic for
people of Davidson, a Leadership

clinic under the administration of
Drs. Palmers and Wyche of Char-
lotte examined the eyes of sixty
people, and as a result of these ex-
aminations about twenty bought

revival there will be an institute on
Evangelism for teachers and lead-
ers of the church. At that time
Wade H. Boggs, Jr., Y Secretary,
and Professor Archibald Currie
will speak to the group in order
to prepare them for the revival
and encourage them to do personal

rendered such great service to the
community as a registered nurse.
Many of Mrs. Mayhew’s friends
from all over Davidson will take
part in this celebration.
