education class told us, very gravely, “I don’t
believe in God.” He was only one year ahead
of me, but his bold sincerity conveyed a
depth of thought far beyond my own. We
veered into a discussion of the factors that
lead people to believe or disbelieve and the
kinds of questions we can ask in order to
clarify our own position. At the end of class,
my teacher thanked everyone for being so
thoughtful in the discussion.

My mother and I talked about God on the
way home from church. “Lots of people
don’t believe in God,” she said, “and many
people don’t think of God as a white-beard-
ed man in the sky who controls everything.
For some people, God is in nature, or is the
thing that allows people to be kind and to
love one another.”

As I grew older, I became less concerned
with the question of God and professed a
kind of casual agnosticism. Soccer games
and school mattered more to me than reli-
gion. This approach to religion illustrates a
defining feature of the Unitarian Universalist
Church, my religious community.

Very few children are raised in the
Unitarian church; it is generally a communi- —
ty of adults, escaped from their more struc-
tured religious traditions.

My ambivalence toward my own religious
upbringing often gives me pause as well; the
encouragement to question spiritual and
social norms is an invaluable gift to a young
adult, yet my own faith is so based in reason
that I rarely ponder my own beliefs.

Unitarian Universalism thrives in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, a seat of afflu-
ence and education, but not in rural or
impoverished areas. I worry it is a smug
community. of non-believers, comfortable in
their irreligiosity. Can I be humble without
God? Is my own moral and ethical code
based in something more than personal
whim and fancy?

The fact that I ask myself these questions
proves my own self-awareness and constant
vigilance against the kind of arrogant,
unflinching reason of which we Unitarians
are so often criticized.
