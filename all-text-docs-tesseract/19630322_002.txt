Student Evaluation

In one of the presidential plat-
forms proposed last week, a sugges-
tion was made that ought not be over-
looked. The suggestion was that the
Student Council sponsor a continued
student evaluation of instruction.

Any professor who has talked to
his students must realize that most of
them are probably as concerned over
the effectiveness of their education
as he is. There is also a concern over
the improvement of the education. So
if there is to be improvement (and this
is supposedly a continuous process),
it would seem best if all those con-
cerned were heard from.

We hope that the new council will
seek to implement such a program by
meeting with the faculty to determine
the specific objectives and general
form for the survey. The form would
probably cover quality of instruction,
a profile of the student, the adequacy
of the text, and organization of the
course.

Once the form was drawn up, it

In Memoriam ...

It seems as if the threats breathed
from above have stilled the brief out-
burst of coughing which occurred re-
cently. Thus the official crack-down
on extracurricular activities during
chapel and vespers continues.

These activities were a cherished
tradition of long standing at Davidson.
Three or four years ago, chapel speak-
ers never faced an audience, but
rather an auditorium filled with news-
paper readers, letter writers, sleepers,
and, it was rumored, even hamburger
eaters. In those days, it was a real
challenge to speak to a Davidson aud-
ience, for the speaker faced not only
impenetrable apathy but open hostili--
ty.

In those days bad speakers found
out that they definitely were not ap-
preciated. They really had to be good
to get any attention at all. The speak-
ers suffered; Chalmers Davidson re-
counts with glee how they suffered
when students could rock the squeaky
benches in the old Shearer Hall and

could be distributed to graduating
seniors to eliminate the possible fear
of reprisals in other classes. The senior
would be instructed to write most of
his comments about professors and
courses in his major field. The forms
would then be collected by the Student
Council and turned over to a commit-
tee or an administrative official for
compiling and surveying the results.

Of course the question immed-
iately arises as to how valid a measure-
ment a student evaluation is. We think
such a survey ,if taken as an aid and
not an absolute, could be very valua-
ble. Youth can be disarmingly honest
if the situation calls for it. We think
that if the results were tabulated over
a certain period of time the “average”
would be just as reliable as some of
the better educational and mental
tests presently available.

If there is such a thing as the crip
course, the students will be the first
to discover it. . .

almust completely drown out the
speech.

Those were the bad old days when
speaker’s feelings were hurt, and
many, including Eugene Carson Blake,
vowed that they would never return
to Davidson. And so it came to pass
that the. traditional ways hurt the rep-
utation of the college, violating one of
the sacred principles of the new era.

Decisions were announced, and
the audiences were tamed three years
ago. The tradition died with a e0-
graphed letter sent to all students. But
traditions die hard around here.

Its ghost returned to haunt us
briefly the other night in vespers,
only to be promptly run off. The bad
old ways have been squashed for good,
it seems. Now the audiences are as
cool as the students themselves,

. though in the bright and shining fu-
ture, some one of us will nostalgically
tell his grandson on his knee, “Yes,
I was the last student ever to cough
at vespers.”

JKA

Noted In Passing...

We understand that there is an
inactive committee called the Great
Issues Committee that has been ac-
cumulating funds over the past sev-
eral years. It was apparently stopped
about the time the Reynolds Lecture
Series was begun because of a possi-
ble overlap.

We conceive the committee as
not conflicting in any way with the
program of the Reynolds Lecture Ser-
les. For one thing the Reynolds Lec-
turers have been primarily scholars
of the arts and sciences. The need for
committed political speakers _ still
exists. Also the Reynolds Lecture
series has not worked with weekend
or Pear long programs with one cen-
tral theme.

In the immediate case, we hope
some of the accumulated money can
be turned over to the Student Coun-
cil’s Program. Committee. They cer-
tainly need the funds.

And plans should be laid for the

committee’s functioning next year.

@ From The Nevtral Spirit, a book
by Berton Roueche: “The presence of
alcohol in practically all existing Neo-
lithic culture does more than indicate
its early origins. It also suggests to
many prehistorians that alcohol was
an active force in man’s early social
development. It is possible, they be-
lieve, that formal agriculture, whose
introduction importantly characterizes
the New Stone Age, may have sprung
from a desire to assure a regular sup-
py of alcohol.”

The testimony of history. Next
witness!

@ A SUGGESTION TO VESPERS
COUGHERS AND OTHER DISEASED
-PERSONS: if speakers inflame your
frustrated throats why don’t you all
get together and “quarantine” your-
selves from certain programs?

It would be a much more effective
way of protesting. And sanitary too.

NSA Discusses Merits
Of USA Peace Corps

BY STAR EVINS

During the weekend of March
13 the National Student Asso-
ciation held a conference in
Washington, D. C. for the pur-
pose of discussing and propos-
ing ideas for a National Domes-
tic Peace Corps. The Domestic
Peace Corps, originally intro-
Guced as possibility by President
Kennedy, was proposed to be a
service corps for humanitarian,
social work in the United States
and set up on the same principle
basis as the International Peace
Corps. :

Secretary of the Interior
Stuart Udall, keynote speaker
at the conference, pointed out
what he considered to be the
great need of such an organiza-
tion. He said that there were
many illiterate stum areas in the
US. which could use social
workers to teach. provide rec-

reation. and perform other such
services for the people.

He also outlined’ what he and
the President's study group on
the.D.P.C. hoped would be the
basic organization of the Corps:
(1) it would be set up on a na-
tional level under the jurisdic-
tion of the federal government,
(2) it would employ any corps-
men over the age of 18 who met
the specified qualifications, (3)
it would not work in areas
where it would possibly cause
regular social workers to lose
their jobs, (4) corpsmen would
go into areas only when invited
by local governments, and (5)
corpsmen would serve primarily
as aids to professional social
workers in particular areas.

With this basis the NS.A.
conference members began
framing the basis of a bill to
submit to Congress which would

Which Way
The Beach?

If Florida press releases are an accurate indication,
Daytona Beach is going all out this year to steal the spring
vacation college trade from Ft. Lauderdale.

Roaming the Daytona beaches
during the March-April holiday
period will be top-name folk
singers, including Peter, Paul,
and Whatsit. and the Brothers
Four. A jazz combo of univer-
sity professors will also present
a number of scheduled and spon-
taneous concerts.

And this is all in addition to
the main attraction of girls,
girls, girls, plus sea, sun, and
suds.

There has been no word from
Ft. Lauderdale, the number one
spring victim of college stud-
ents for the last few years, but
it undoubtedly is preparing for
its usual onslaught of pleasure-
seeking collegians.

And they certainly will be
there, in spite of the fact that
many students last spring for-
sook Lauderdale—scene of the
movie “Where the Boys Are"—
for Daytona Beach where they
claimed they found a “friend-
lier’ atmosphere for their “ac-
tivities.”

There have been several “dis-
turbances” at Ft. Lauderdale
during recent spring vacations,
and it may be the resort's city
fathers are beginning to tire of

the college-set antics, despite |

the money.

Meanwhile, Daytona Beach of-
ficials have said that they will
spend at least 6,000 dollars to
entertain the 50,000 college
students expected there during
the spring vacation period.

The clty officials ere bank-
ing heavily on the big folk
concerts, scheduled through-
out the holideys. Appearing
along with Peter, Peul, and

Mery end the Brothers Four,
will be the Huntemen and the
Folksters.

The jazz combo of university
professors will be headed by Dr.
John Parker, formerly English
professor at Kentucky Wesleyan
College, Owensboro, Ky., and
now professor at Meredith Col-
lege, Fayetteville, N. C. ;

Also at Daytona will be the
Rev. Malcolm Boyd, Episcopal
chaplain at Detroit's Wayne
University, who has become na-
tionally known as the “expresso
priest,” because of his liking to
meet and talk with college stud-
ents.

Daytona Beach appears to be
trying its best to capture the
spring vacation college trade.
Perhaps all it needs is some
place to replace the Elbo Room.

authorize an actual Domestic
Peace Corps.

Unfortunately, conference
members became so engrossed
in framing the structure of the
corps they failed to see if there
Teally was the great need for
such a corps and if it was the
duty of the federal government
to undertake such an action at
such great expense.

In criticism of the Domestic
Peace Corps, Representative
Finley of IHinois gave substan-
tial statistics which showed that
the 5,000 proposed Domestic
Peace Corps workers would
make only a very slight dent in
the enormous amount of social
workers already in operation.
.He pointed out that there are
already many service organiza-
tions which need and employ
social workers and that there is
no great need for the federal
government to take the expense
of such an operation.

Another criticism which could
be raised against the corps as
Proposed by the N.S.A. is the
fact that corpsmen could possi-
bly be prevented from going
into an area where there is
greatest need but no integra-
tion. This factor defeats the
whole humanitarian basis of the
corps and could prevent work
in the area where it is really
needed most, the South.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ay «4 We Need Less Criticism,

More Pride In Davidson”

Graves

Dear Editor:

Like Richard R. Bernard in
his letter to THE DAVIDSON.
IAN two weeks ago, I too am
concerned about the number of
articles in the college news-
paper which are extremely criti-
cal of our college, its faculty,
and it students.

My concern, however, is not
defiance. I sincerely think that
qany such articles are excellent
and necessary to the well-being
of the school. Oftentimes, a well-
written editorial is the most ef-
fective means possible of jolting
a group out of states of laxness,
insobriety, or indifference,

But one is continually forced
to read about student-faculty
bickering over the drinking rule,
problems in the drama depart-
ment, or the faculty oath issue.
Is there really anything of value
arising from the turbid editor-
ials and torrid letters on these
topics? I am not suggesting that
students should give up their in-
terest in such issues, but I do

think that, in their unsettled.

states, these problems should
not appear so often in the pages
of our publication. When pro-
gress is definitely made and
problems are solved, then is the
time to inform the student body.

it seems thet we could, for
a change, be thankful for
some of the good things at
Davidson thet we come in con-
tect with each day, and not
worry so much about the
drinking rule or the faculty
oath. As a freshman. when.
outsiders ask me about my
school, | don’t think of those
things.

Instead, I remember our tradi-
tionally close student-faculty re-
lationship . . . our superior fra-
ternity system which affects a
great percentage of our student
body .. . our diversified curri-
culum ... our liberal scholar-
ship aid for needy students .. .
our basketball team .. . our out-
standing lecture and concert
Program ... our dance week-
ends . .. the honor system .
and the spirit of friendship and
concern for each other that
permeates the student body.

To me, these are the import-
ant things. We should always
strive for improvement, but we
should also have pride in what
we have.

David

Dear Editor:

Election time here at David-
son brings to light the basic
cause underlying many of the
Problems with which we are fac-
ed. There seems to be through-
out the year a steady undercur-
rent of gripes by the student
body from the vague drinking
rule or the question of three re-
views on one day to the lack of
academic freedom or the ineffec-
tiveness of the student govern-
ment. Whether these gripes are
validly based is not the ques
tion, but rather what the grumb-
lers are doing about it.

Those thet do the most com

Jim Graves

plaining seem fo be the very
ones who show fhe most
apathy. They'll hit you with
something Nike: “This plece
is so bad that you can’t de eny-
thing about it.” It is obvious
thet if everyone held = this
opinion, there would be 6 com-
plete lack of student interest
or participation in campus
tite.

This apathy has been demon-
strated in the elections last
week where approximately 400
students turned out at the polls.
It seems to me that to take the
initiative to vote is the chief
responsibility of a Davidson
student, even if he doesn’t in-
tend to contribute anything else.
The energy it takes to get a vot-
ing card and use it is the least
a student can do.

Dear Editor:
The literary qualities of THE

DAVIDSONIAN's feature arti- ©

cles have not been outstanding
in recent months, but one would
expect a little extra effort to be
made on those dealing with cer-
tain subjects. The story on the
late “Pop” Copeland, in particu-
lar, showed a lack of some of the
basic requirements for good
journalism.

I am not allowea space to give
a complete list of the logical and
stylistic errors in the article, but
the following examples should
prove my point. The word
“legend” is used ten times in
the article, including once in
each of the first five sentences.
Only toward the end of the
story does the writer seem to
realize this excessive repetition,
when he erroneously ses
“myth” as a synonym.

One sentence bears specific
attention: “To supplement the
inadequately harsh. light the
school had provided for his
desk, the eyeball-conscious frosh
could always find lamps of softer
electrical tones.” Did the fresh-
men want lights that, were ade-
quately harsh? And what in the
name of Edison are “electrical
tones?” In this sentence I note
the word “eyeball-conscious;”

*- elsewhere I find such phrases

as “the big life right here,”
“jungle full,” and “realm of
life," and I am told that one
can “spin his life away.” Not
all of these are major mistakes,
but taken with others, they add
up.

In addition, there is question-
able taste displayed in the head-
line and tone of the article and .
in the wording of the third and
thirteenth paragraphs. Worst of
all, the emphasis is more on the
loss of the store than of the
man. Finally, the writer showed
poor judgment in using this
article as a means of exhibiting
his personal animosity toward
the administration.

Everett Huggins

(Editor’s Note: Ail this writ-
er’s points about the article
ere not violations of the “basic
requirements for good journs-
lism.” Repetition is not neces-
sarily a stylistic error, end
unique phrases are in fact the
mark of 8 good feature writer.
Most of the “tastes” and the
“requirements” expressed ap-
peer pretty subjective.)
