Frolics Hailed Success

By JIM MORAWETZ
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Last Sunday, a tide of
over 600 girls receded from
the Davidson campus leav-
ing in their wake slowly dis-
solving hangovers, exhaus-
tion, and the last of good
times at Davidson for
months.

Spring Frolics began Friday
night with Dionne Warwick and
Mary Wells in a concert on the
front steps of Chambers Build-
ing. while Fred Smoot and the
Lettermen performed in Cham-
bers Auditorium
night.

The open air concert on Fri-

day was generally favorably re-

ceived by the hundreds of cou-
ples seated on blankets on the
front lawn of Chambers. Both
singers drew applause despite
trouble fromthe public address
system and long performances
by such minor stars as Little
Royal between their appear-
ances.

Saturday's concert drew com-
menis from. both students and
dates. Fred Smoot, appearing
first. soon established a com-
fortable rapport with the large
audience and drew loud laugh-
ter with his Johnathan Winters-

performance.

VARIETY

Perhaps the most polished per-
formance of the weekend was
given by the Lettermen, who
have appeared at over 350 col-
leges throughout the country.
The group combined rock and
roll, folk songs, traditional fa-
vorites, instrumentals, and com-
edy to create a varied, enter-
taining effect.

Despite loud cheers which fol-
lowed them off stage. the trio
expressed some disappointment
with their reception.

One member of the group com-
mented that they had never be-
fore been hissed by a crowd,
ignorant, of course, of the some-
what warped reactions which
the Davidson audience tradition-
ally offers guests of Chambers
Auditorium. F

IFC President Jim Terry no-
ted that the Lettermen were ex-
tremely concerned over the fact
that they were forced’ to begin
the concert late. and were afraid

that the audience might be some-.

what hostile for this reason.

Terry went on to explain that
a plane chartered by the IFC to
bring the group from a Satur-
day afternoon concert at The
Citadel had proven too small to
carry their drums or string bass.

Despite reluctance on their
part, they were persuaded to be-
gin without the bass, using
drums borrowed from a student.
Said Terry, ‘‘the great perform-
ance which they gave without
the bass is an indication of how
great they are.”

say that he hoped this situation
would be changed to some de-

Asked if he thought students
would actually wish to have par-
ties on campus, Burts replied
that in his opinion students
would be able to enjoy them-
selves despite current ‘‘restric-
tions” on their conduct. He went
on to say that he at least thought
that the future would bring a
closer relation between union
and campus functions.

A greater cooperation between

would be ‘‘much more diversi-
fied and satisfying.”

YMCA Outlines Plans

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

A coffee house for the ‘“‘in-
tellectual fringe” is among
the new proposals in the
plans for the YMCA next
year. Proposed by Chaplin
Will Terry, the coffee house
will be located somewhere
in Davidson, and will fea-
ture a Greenwich Village at-
mosphere.

Said YMCA President Murray
Smith, “This is not to be a place
strictly for entertainment, but
chiefly for stimulation."’ The em-
phasis will be on student discus-
sions, poetry readings. and out-

vof-class faculty lectures. Coffee,
‘soft drinks, and perhaps some
frozen pizzas will be served.

On the weekend of Aprit 10-11,
the YMCA Cabinet met at Camp
‘Thunderbird to discuss the pur-
poses and plans for the organi-
, zation in the coming year.

1

Smith reported that the retreat
+ was highly successful, and that
the programs outlined at the
meeting are already taking
shape. “We feel,’ he added,
“that we have filled some gaps
that were evident in the past
and strengthened some weak
' Areas.” °

The faculty Religious Life
Committee met Thursday for an
informal lunch, to hear a pro-
posal by Smith to expand the
vespers requirement to include
attendance at any church, the
city not being considered. This
proposal has secured the sup-
port of the Student Council, and
Smith expressed optimism that
it will be accepted.

Other changes and additions,

as a result of the retreat. in-
clude one new committee and re-
organization of others.

LECTURE PLANS

Jay Federman, chairman of
the Lectures Committee, plans
to combine Great Issues.and Fo-
rums, creating a concentrated
three day program. During this
period, probably in first semes-
ter, three outstanding personal-
ities and authorities will meet
the students to present their
ideas and to receive criticism
from each other and from stu-
dents.

George Nzongloa, in charge of
Tutorials, plans to work closely
with the local high schools in

-trying to fill the needs of pupils

who need help or. who desire ad-
vanced study. Interested per-
sons should contact him right
away.

A new committee has been
formed out of a section of the
Tutorial committee. Mike Mooty
is to head the Community Cul-
ture Committee, which will work
with local teenagers in planning
trips to concerts, movies, and

an outlet for those interested in
dramatics.

FRESHMAN DISCUSSIONS

The possibility of no rush next
year has prompted Neill Mc-
Bryde to propose the Freshman
Discussions Committee. These
discussions would be in the halls
of the freshman dormitories,
serving to enable them to adjust
to the new environment and to
meet upperclassmen and profes-
sors.

ment in the late fifties and has
the

been popular throughout

country with frequent produc-

tions ever since. It is a long one-

act play with only three char-

acters.

An old couple in their nineties
reflect on the uselessness of
their lives and prepare for a

meeting during which an orator,

who has been hired, will speak
to mankind for them, so that

their lives will not have been
lived completely in vain.

Mrs. Constance Welsh of Da-
vidson, Volumnia in Coriolanus,
and Simon Blackford. a Rich-
ardson scholar from England
who played Coriolanus in the
same production, are teamed to-
gether again as the old couple.
The burden of the play is on
them, for, for over an hour they
must’ create and sustain the
characterizations of ninety year-
olds.

“They do a fantastic job!" Ru-
pert Barber, Jr., professor of
drama and director of the pro-
duction, said earlier this week.
‘Every rehearsal they grow old-
er and older, This is an extreme-
ly difficult play and I am ex-
tremely fortunate to have two
such intelligent and capable peo-
ple doing these roles.”

The third role, the Orator,
will be played by Rawley Tur-
ner, who will double as stage
manager.

The second play, The New
Tenant, is a short after-piece,

land of Davidson as the Care-
taker: Michael Light, another;
student from England, as the
Gentleman: and Mike Arrowood

partment. with Howard Bryan
and Bill Staples in charge of
building them. Lighting wil! be

YMCA Extends Drive

The YMCA Easter Gift Fund has
collected approximately $600 to date,
in an effort to reach an intended goal

of $2400. The deadline fo

tion period has been extended to May
5 to give students a chance to recover

from Spring Frolics.
Neill McBryde, publicity

the Y Fund Drive said, “We hope to

reach our goal, but it all

student reaction to the drive.” An in-
novation this year, the Inter-Fraternity
Competition, is not working well be-
cause not enough contributions have
been received yet, according to Mc-

Bryde, but the charts are

lobby of the Union and will be revised
daily to show how each fraternity
stands in amount and percentage do-

nations.

All donations received from this
YMCA Drive will go to help send nine
students to Ecuador this summer in a
sort of “cultural exchange program.”

Fred Ehlers, originator of PRAM
and his exchange project, remarked

father’s life (V-e-r-e-e-n? You
sure about that?).

We learned that being a writer
is not an easy life, and that
Swamp Water is probably a good
book. Then Bell got around to
the prize. Third place went to
Kerr Thompson, a senior from
Blanch, North Carolina, for his

story “The Gift.” Second place -

was awarded to Herb Jackson,
a sophomore from Raleigh, for
a series of poems entitled “And
So, Love.”

Finally, the $75 first prize
check went to a freshman from
Kensington, Maryland, Paul John
deLaschmutt Monk. All right,
fine. All we needed now were a
few quotes from the winner, and
we'd be all set for the story.

So we went to see him. And
found the real story was not the
money, nor even the award it-
self, but the wild and wonderful
world in which Monk makes his
home. It’s bedlam, literally and
literarily. People are circulating
constantly around him, carrying
on several conversations at once.
Monk fields friendly insults by
the bushels, and jokes about his
poetic success.

He refuses to have anything
from his work quoted, but most
of us remember ‘‘The Saga of
Old Flamplank Oldsmobile,” that

of each. But

nutty concoction that won the
freshman writing contest for
Monk. We asked to see some
more of his work, and got more
than we had bargained for. He
is prolific, and his style has a
seemingly endless variety of fa-
cets.

Monk's friends think highly of
him. “He's serious about his
work,” they say, and tell of oc-
casions when he’s gotten them
out of bed late at night to read
and comment on a new poem.
Monk denies it, but not very ve-
hemently.

In short, he’s a character, in
the best sense of the word. Bell
describes his work as ‘‘fasci-
nating, and fun to read.’ An
English department member
comments on his ‘“‘great poten-
tial,’ which he ascribes primar-
ily to the influence of his own
English instructor, Moreland
Hogan, Of his work, most of
which is “Poetry of the Absurd,”’
some will deny its meaning, but
few its merit.

We got our story, though in
trying to tell too much of the
prize and Paul, we told too litte.
