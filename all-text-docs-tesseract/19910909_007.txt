Students Must

Speak Out About
Campus Lighting

By Curt Bickers

Reflecting on my freshman
experience here, I think back to the
first weekend. Orientation was well
underway and the Class of 1993
was being drilled about the Honor
System one evening. The meeting
was over, my new-found friends
and I were contemplating what was
said, and we walked out of Cham-
bers towards Belk, only to be
blinded by the darkness.

Needless to say, over the next
few years I have adjusted to the
dim lighting around campus, but
the issue of lighting is atopic which
everyone must face. How is the
lighting system on campus? What
is the worst area on campus? What
are the improvements which need
to be made? How safe do people
really feel inour seemingly bubbled
world?

There are many questions to be
asked and answered around cam-
pus inorder toset therecord straight
about Davidson’s lighting. lasked
students, faculty, public safety of-
ficers, the Physical Plant, Alumni

Relations, rani the Dean of ‘Stu- °

dents several questions regarding
how safe they feel on campus, what
improvements should be made in
lighting, if they feel lighting has
improved, and what area is the
worst lit on campus.

Seven students expressed a
variety of views about Davidson’s
lighting. Some students said they
do not feel safe walking at night
around campus. At the same time,
others have complete confidence
in the safety of the community.
Some use the escort service while
others have never even given it a
thought. The area that students cited
as the worst lit on campus is the
area between Chambers and the
row of dorms from Little to Duke.
They talked of almost running into
people while going orcoming from
the library at night.

Another poorly lit area is be-
tween the Sports Complex and
Johnston Gym. They repeatedly
suggested to simply put up more
lights. One senior, however, put
the whole lighting picture into
perspective. “There definitely has
been a big change in lighting since
I matriculated here, The bureauc-
racy as a whole has improved the
safety of our school so much. I’m
glad about that.”

The Physical Plant had some
suggestions for anyone wanting to
make a difference or get involved.
Philip Cashion said students who
find problems such as burnt out
lights should call in work orders.
The Physical Plant staff is not
around as much at night so they
cannot always monitor all of the
lights on campus. The Physical

Plan. does operate a system with ©

~ the police in which the night patrol

wraps ribbon around each light
pole that is out. Also, once a week
the Physical Plant turnson the lights
in the daytime checks the bulbs.
But this system is not foolproof, so
students can do their part.
Cashion informed me that the
improvements are far from over.
He said that ten to twelve more
lights will be added this school
year. The lights will be installed
around the Union, Chemistry, and
Biology buildings. Money is not a
problem. Each pole costs around
$700. Bob Collins controls the
finances and decides where the
lights go. The Physical Plant is
making a good effort to provide
Davidson with a safe environment.
Two Public Safety officers
provided helpful suggestions to all
students regarding safety in gen-
eral. The officers definitely feel
that the Physical Plant has done a
lot with the lighting and trimming
hedges to make areas safer. The
officers’ distress was with the
naivete of the students. They ask
students to call if they see someone

who is not from the campus on »

campus. One officer said that the
lighting is better here than at some
other area campuses. Like the stu-
dents, they both felt that the worst
lit area is between Chambers and
the row dorms. The officers also
pushed the escort service, because
few students use it and it is so
readily available.

Will Terry, Dean of Students,
believes that there are dark spots
on campus, but does not want the
campus bathed in light. He says we
have been very lucky not to have
had any incidents so far, but he

also commends the Public Safety

for providing a safe atmosphere
for students. He also praised the
Physical Plant for already improv-
ing greatly the campus lighting.
Sue Ross, Registrar, expressed
interest in more lighting because

’ she frequently works really late at

night, She conveys that students
can help by speaking to herself, the
Dean of Students office, or Resi-
dence Life, where they may sub-
mit-a work order or complaint.
Ross feels that the reason things

are not done is because students do

not voice their problems,

Overall, the safety of the stu-.
dents is the first priority of campus

officials. Students need to submit
written orders if they think a cer-
tain area isnot safe, It takes time to
put in the lighting and rewiring as
well. So, until the Physical Plant
can accomplish all of the improve-

ments, use the escort service, or’

walk witha friend if you are afraid.
Wehave been alucky campus, and
if the Davidson community works
together, it will continue to be safe
for all.

I do not consider myself to be
old-fashioned ora prude, but lately
I’ve been a little horrified at some
of the things I’ve read in newspa-
pers, including The Davidsonian.

reading the story, I laughed and

too much. Why a student-written
piece concerning something so
technical and sensitive was

Dahmer’s “practices” in Milwau-

subscribers were practically force-
fed pieces of information thatmay
have been best leftimplied. While
I recognize the newsworthiness
of such a story, I sincerely ques-
tion the necessity of being told
over and overagain precisely what
Dahmer did with every conceiv-
able body part.

Must we know everything?
Is it too much to ask that we be
spared a few details? I mean,
most of us really didn’t want to

Freshman Odyssey is beyond me.
Now, before everyone gets too
upset, I want to say in the most
absolute of terms that such infor-
mation is vital and awareness is
crucial.

But as far as I’m concerned,
the subject could best be presented
in another medium. Wouldn’ta
pamphlet written by a physician
and mailed to every student’s post
office box, or a hall lecture given
by Health Educator Georgia
Ringle be more effective? I think
so. Many of us are sick to death
of being grossed out every time
we read the newspaper.

topic that is sure to get me in hot
water. I found last week’s Sexual-

of serious physical or emotional
concern, there are better ways to
gain awareness than to shock read-
ers with embarassingly graphic

A: Does something vex thee, Jay?
J: Aye, but alas I fear my frustra-

tivities.

to truly cross these tracks.

A: Are you sure? Yesterday, I

went to Comwell Drugs and bought

the latest issue of Ebony magazine.

I go over the tracks on the way to

KFC. Seldom is there a place on

Main Street where one cannot see

the tracks. How can you say that

the College is afraid of the tracks?

The College is on the tracks!

J: I wish that were true, because if
the College were on the tracks, it
would be much closer to the other

side than it has ever been in the

past. But we won’t get close

enough to the tracks to see what’s

going on over there. I guess we’re

afraid of being run over by trains.

A: Buthow close is close enough?
J: That’s the point, you can never
get too close. Most of us get close
enough to tutor one or two young
people, or take a turkey toa family
at Thanksgiving, but never close
enough to see that there is poverty
anda huge drug problem once you
cross these tracks. We should all
make time to take a much closer
look at what’s on the other side of

help improve things for those who
are forced to stay there. It might
make us uncomfortable, but we
mustremember that, nomatterhow
much we dislike what we see, we’ ll
always be able to cross back.

A: Is it-your-point then that-we

_ ignore the tracks and that we must

assume more responsibility, orisit

that we inherit a way of life that is
not questioned and should be?
J: I’dhave to say both, if lunder-
stand your question correctly.
We can all do more, from indi-
vidual students like you and me
on up to the College as a whole.
We're all guilty of some degree
of apathy. With enough effort,
we can strip the tracks of their
negative symbolism. That way
they probably wouldn’thurt your
feet so badly, either.
A: Let us hope so. But I think
that it is important that we exam-
ine this environment, Can weset
up some time to discuss matters
further?

J: How about in two weeks or
so? As for now, shall partake of

A: We shall.
