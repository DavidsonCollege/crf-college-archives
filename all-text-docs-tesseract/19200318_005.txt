Probably the idea of establishing a
chair of Economics is to instruct

“Davidson never does anything by

Davidson, along with her other
distinctions, has the champion tax-

recently purchased a dog for .05 and
then paid a $2.00 tax on it.

RESOLUTIONS

Adopted by the Student Volunteer

nion of North Carolina for
° Foreign Missions.

Whereas, we have been led by the
providence of God to this good hour
and have been given a new vision of
the world and its needs, and.

Whereas,. a definite program
would lead to more and better re-
sults,

Therefore, be it resolved by the
Student Volunteer Union of North
Carolina for Foreign Missions, in
session at Davidson College, March
14, 1920:

First. That we set as our goal
this spring, seventy-five (75) per
cent of every student body reached
through mission study classes, fo-
tums, or some other methods, with
the definite call of the world for
men and money.

Second. That we unite in a goal
of giving at least one dollar per stu-
dent in our colleges during the ses-
sion 1919-20 and one dollar and a
half per student during 1920-21 for
foreign missions.

Third. That the weeks ending the
second Sunday in April and the sec-
ond Sunday in October be set as
weeks of prayer when all bands in
our union will offer our united pray-
ers that God will call whomsoever
He will of our number to become
foreign missionaries, and will use
us in reaching the hearts of our fel-
low students.

Fourth. That our college ex-
change representatives at least once
a year, under the direction of our
executive committee, thereby creat-
ing a spirit of co-operation and fel-

| : . oe
lowship and exchanging ideas and

methods.

Fifth. That a copy of these reso-
lutions be inscribed in the minutes
of our union, a copy sent to each

FRATERNITY RECEPTION |
| ENJOYED BY VISITORS |

Probably the biggest event in the
experiences of the Volunteers out-
side of the conference itself was the
fraternity reception at 10:30 Satur-
-day night. This reception was simi-
ilar to those given by the fraternities
‘during the speakings and com-
| mencement, and all were invited to
i visit the halls. It didn’t take long
|for the visitors to catch on to the
| routine of the visiting, and before
‘many minutes everything was in full
‘sway. At each hall the delegates
_and their escorts were led to the)
;punch bowl, and when the rounds
‘had been made, few there were who! WE DELIVER
had not done their duty. |

Most of the delegates attended the
‘reception, and those who did not,
lwhen they heard about it, wished,
| that they had. |

WHITE'S MARKET

Student Volunteer Conference,
Davidson, N. C., Mar. 12-14.
To the Davidson Student Body and
Community :

We, the Student Volunteers of
North Carolina, wish to express our
thanks to you for your friendly co-
operation and true Southern hospi-
tality while we were with you dur-
ing our yearly conference.

We wish to thank especially the
Student Body as a whole, the Fac-|
ulty and friends in town, for inviting
us to come to Davidson. Also the!
Local Conference Committee, led;
by Mr. R. E. McClure, upon whom
most of the burden of arrangements |
rested. We would not forget Dr.
Richards, Mr. Miles, Miss Shaw, Dr.
Arbuckle, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Tre-:
main and others who assisted in
_every way to make the conference;
a success.

We shall always remember the re-:
ception given by the Y. M. C. A. on,
Saturday afternoon. Also the Ly-,
cecum attraction given that night by

Student Body, and the. good cn |

|

afterwards given us by the fraterni-
ties.

We wish above all to thank those |
| who gave us a glimpse of the real!
life on the mission fields, and those |
| who by the earnestness of their ap-
peal inspired us “to go and do like-
i wise.”

WE print the Davidson College
Magazine, the Davideonian, and
many other GOOD publications.
The myriad of other good jobs we print would fill this

magazine to describe them---but we have room for
