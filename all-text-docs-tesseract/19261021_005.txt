Edgar Woods Speaks to
Students at “Y” Sunday

Prortinent Alumnus Makes Inter-
esting Talk

Rev. Edgar Woods, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church of Salisbury, N. C.,
was the speaker at'the “Y” vesper services
last Sunday night. Mr. Woods is a grad-
uate of Davidson of the class of 1919. W. S.
Woods, of the Senior class, is a brother of
Rev. Mr. Woods.

The speaker was introduced by one of his
fellow collegemates, Mr. J. P. Williams, who
called attention to the prominence of Rev.
Mr. Woods during his college career.

The subject:of the speaker’s talk was, “A
General Idea of Self-Respect.” He men-
tioned the brave stand of the 300: Spartans
against the host the for that
which they held sacred. They were fighting
for love of home. Then, he used the illus-
tration of the multitudes of people of the
European countries who joined the Crusaders

gto fight to regain the birthplace of the Christ.

Bringing the subject hgme to his audience,
the speaker reminded his listeners that their
bodies were temples of the living God. He
exhorted the students to fight for this tem-
ple with the same self-respect the Spartans
fought for their homes.

Some of the ways the speaker suggested
this be the careful selection of
friends, reading and other environments, and
the ability to say NO when confronted with
temptation.

done was

In the same way the country
guards the health and welfare, so we should
guard this temple of the living God.

The way to obtain honor such as Robert
FE. Lee had when he refused to sell his name
for an unworthy cause is to have: cleanliness
of thought, speech, and action; faithfulness
in life and work. “The world is crying for
men with vision to dead it.on. TH any man
stands aloof and lets his opportunity go by
he will be met with shame later in life.”

Closing his talk with the story of Will
Spencer, of - Northwestern University, who
plunged through the surf on 16 different
océasions to rescue 17 people; when he was
taken exhausted from the water his words
were, “Did I do my best?” so it will be with
us when we come to the end of our life, “Did
we do our best?”

Social fraternities exist in almost every
college or university in the United States,
except in the state-owned and state-controlled
institutions of South Carolina and Missis- |
sippi, which states prohibit the existence of
such organizations. The pressure of the
fraternities is poignantly felt in the college
life. Sometimes it may be for good; it might
be for evil. But it is believed that the good
from. such groups at Davidson
supersedes and counter-balances the bad ef-
fects that originate therefrom.

Fraternities had their inception at. this
Presbyterian institution in. 1859, when the |
Chi Pi fraternity was originated. Its ex-
istence was secret, and nothing has been
known of it since that time. Ten years later,
in 1869, the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity was
organized at Davidson, “When its badges
were displayed the college expressed its dis-
approval, and the chapter ‘acquiesced to the
wishes of the officials,.returning its charter
to the national body. It was 1893 before the
charter was again granted.

The first fraternity at Davidson to gain
open and official recognition was the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, which established
1883. Three years before that, Kappa Alpha
was organized, but it secretly existed until
1884, a year following the organization. of
the S. A. KE. fraternity. The Mystic Seven
was organized in 1885, but four years later
was merged into a chapter of Beta Theta
Pi. The Kappa Sigmas were established in
1890. For one year, 1887-1888, the Phi Alpha
Chi fraternity existed at Davidson, but noth-
ing was heard of it after that. Sigma Nu
Kappa was mentioned in the annual of 1897,
but little is known of it beyond this.

Within the last several years there has been

a marked increase in the number of such or-
In 1823, the Bach
elors Club, which has been existing for ap
proximately 10 years, received a charter from
Phi Gamma Delta. The Phi Alpha Pi local
fraternity merged into Theta Upsilon Omega
fraternity in 1924, after three years of life.
The Pi Kappa Phis were reinstated in this
same year, at
Davidson during the years of 1911 and 1918,
and when reorganized as a local in 1924, was
known as the Kappa Phi fraternity.

This makes a total of eight national fra-
ternities at Davidson today. In addition
there are three locals—Delta Theta Chi,
Sigma Delta and Pyramid Club. The first
named has been on the Davidson campus for
six years, while the last two had their be-
ginning within the past three years. The
grand total of fraternities here is eleven.

ganizations at Davidson.

The latter was in existence

Little difference is noticeable between the
percentage of students in fraternities today
and in 1892. In March of that year 42 per
cent of the student body were members. In
the scholastic year of 1924-1925, 44 per cent
were in social fraternities. In 1892 the total
enrollment was 150 students, while it exceeds
650 now, showing that there has been a pro-
portionate increase. Statistics show that in
1919-1920 only 25 per cent of the students
were inmates, but the addition of six fra-
ternites in the past six years has accounted
for increased percentage in the membership.

With almost half of the students of David-
son in fraternities, and half without the por-
tals, the question is asked whether’or not
factions do not which combat
other in student body election. The consen-

exist, each
sus of opinion seems to be that there is less
feeling of antagonism between the men in
fraternities and those outside than at present
is prevalent at any other school.

The offices of the student body seem to be
equally divided. Last year two of the most.
outstanding men were non-fraternity stu-
dents, these ‘men being the president of the

sonian. Men are generally elected on their

prestige or rating on the campus, as judged
by fraternity membership.

Many people condemn fraternities unwant-
They look upon one student sometimes
as a criterion, and oftentimes he is one who
did not take advantage of a fraternity’s as-

i sets; hence, they judge all such organizations

as being millstones instead of milestones.

| Others judge fraternities as a whole by

be the worst organization of that nature in
school. Others condemn them upon heresay.
There are advantages and disadvantages. The
former outweigh the latter, if the student
is the right kind of person.

One of the strongest arguments of those
opposed to such orgariizations is that the
social life distracts a student from his studies
—that a fraternity is a breeding place for |
procrastination. Again it can be asserted
that it rests with thé individual. -The college |

PHI BETA KAPPA ELECTS
FOUR NEW MEN

The Davidson College chapter of
the Phi Beta Kappa, national hon-

orary scholastic fraternity, an-
nounces the election of four new
men. The newly elected men are

W. A. Christian, W. S. Woods, W.
T. Covington, and H. M. Austin.
These four men stand highest in
their class in scholarship and each
has averaged well over ninety per
cent for the past three years.

All four of the men are members
of the present senior class, andare
the first men to be chosen by the
Phi Beta Kappa’s from the class.
It is very probable that other mem-
of the. sénior will be
honored by the fraternity at a later
election this year. The four men
have, without exception, taken
leading part in activities,
and each one of them holds mem-
bership in other honorary organi-
zations on the campus.

Change in Alumni |

Reunions Planned.

Alumni returning to Dovidson have criti-
cised the manner in which they have been re-
ceived. Under the present system of having

'every five-year class return they complain

that they meet men older or younger than
those with whom they were associated in
college.

For this reason a plan of having classes
return in groups is being discussed. or in-
stance, classes between 1900 and 1905 would
return at one commencement. Another group,
1905 to 1910, would return the following
year, and the other groups of five would
continue in this manner till all had been)
here once. Then the first group would have |
its second reunion, and the others would fol-

low in order. |

Suggestions from all alumni and their opin- |
ions as to the feasibility of this plan will be !
greatly appreciated. All alumni interested in
this subject are requested to write to the
Alumni Secretary.
