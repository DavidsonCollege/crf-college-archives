Basketball returnees bring hope of good season

By VAN BECK .
Staff Writer

The preseason ‘‘bottom line”
on the 1980-81 edition of Wild-
cat Basketball shows a power-
ful, veteran frontcourt coupled
with a questionable and rela-
tively inexperienced backcourt.
Third year Coach Eddie Bieden-
bach welcomes back his entire
front line along with key re-
serves, but once again the
guards are unproven and must
be productive if the ’Cats are to
compete for the Southern Con-
ference crown.

The offensive end should not
be a problem unless guard play
breaks down completely. Good
shooters abound as Davidson
shot .502 from the field last
year. Plaguing Biedenbach’s
squad throughout last season’s
8-18 campaign, defense is an
area that must be improved if
the ’Cats are to compete with
the likes of Notre Dame, Wake
Forest and UNC-C to name just
a few. The coaching staff has
added several highly regarded
recruits which should bolster
Davidson’s overall attack and
with additional improvement
from the regulars of a year ago,
Wildcat fans can expect bigger
and better things.

Down low the ’Cats will
definitely play power basket- |
ball, that is if Rich DiBenedetto
has anything to say about the
offensive sets. DiBenedetto,

game last season. One of the
conference’s finest shooters,
Haynes will captain this year’s
team. Junior Jamie Hall will
alternate between center and
forward with Haynes. Hall ex-
perienced somewhat of a sopho-
more slump while compiling
just under 10 point and 7
rebound averages, but as
Biedenbach commented, ‘The
learning experience, coupled
with off-season training, should
make the unusually quick, agile
Hall the type of player David-
son fans have been waiting to
see.”

Cliff Tribus will also see
plenty of action at all three
inside positions. The 6’10’’
sophomore emerged as a con-
sistent scoring threat late last
season and his excellent touch

‘will present matchup difficulties

for opponents.

Junior transfer John Corso
and junior Brian Rowan round
out the front court and both will
see action at small forward.
Corso played a year at the
University of Florida before
moving north and possesses the
bulk necessary at 6’5’’, 215
pounds to handle himself inside.
Rowan, the best conditioned
athlete on the team, has played
solid ball and started some as a
freshman.

finds a situation of strength in
numbers. Five different players
can swing to second guard,
including John Carroll, Frosh
John Gullickson, Rich Wilson,
Franz and Kenny Wilson. Car-
rol boasts the most experience
and plays excellent defense
which compliments his ball
handling skills. His offensive
output left a little to be desired
a year ago, but the 6’2”’ sopho-
more who played at Dematha
High in Rockville, Maryland
possesses good offensive quick-
ness and goes to the hoop very
strongly.

Rich Wilson, also a soph-
omore, played well as a fresh-
man and has good size and
strength at 6’6’’, 198 pounds to
be effective as a swing man.
Gullickson however could get
the nod due to his shooting
touch and court knowledge
which is exceptional for a
freshman. Gullickson averaged
24.4 points as a high school
senior with a high of 42 while
shooting 50 percent from the

Cats on both
ends of routs

By CRAIG WHITE
Sports Editor
After two games, Davidson’s
basketball team has tasted the
sweet and the sour, as the Cats
routed Wofford but were humil-

ms iated by the speedy N.C. State

Wolfpack three nights later.

One of the key plays in last
Friday’s 92-60 blow-out of Wof-
ford at Johnston Gym occurred
early in the second half when
freshman guard John Gullick-
son spotted forward Richie Di-
Benedetto on a long pass for a
quick layup. As basic as it may
seem, this play was typical of
Gullickson’s performance who,
along with freshman point
guard Tommy McConnell, com-
bined to score 22 points. Short-
ly after the fast break play,
Gullickson and McConnell took
turns in scoring on fast break
layups.

Between the two of them,
Gullickson and McConnell tal-
lied seven steals with McCon-
nell finishing with ten assists,
two more assists than the entire
Wofford squad mustered.

Although behind 6-0 early,
the Cats soon got into the flow
of the game when McConnell
was successful in getting the
team involved offensively. But
with nine minutes left in the
half, the Terriers went ahead
23-20 thus prompting Coach
Biedenbach to yank all starters
except junior center Jamie Hall.

It was in the second half
however that McConnell and
Gullickson perfected the fast
break scoring 16 unanswered
points. Also impressive was
Cliff Trubus’ team-high 16
points scored on eight of ten
attempts. Other key players
included Jamie Hall and junior
transfer John Corso, who both
tallied 11 points.

Just as easily as Davidson
handled Wofford, N.C. State
rolled over the Cats 89-72 last
Monday night in Raleigh. Cru-
cial in the defeat was the
inability of the Cats to stop
Wolfpack forward Art Jones
who chalked up 22 points and a
game-high 15 rebounds; the
