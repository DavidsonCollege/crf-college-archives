Come on” the
Swat’em out!’

As the big leaguers swing into action
watch those Chesterfield packages pop
out, of the pockets.

There’s big league pleasure for you...
everything you want in a cigarette.

A homer if there ever was one... all
the way ’round the circuit for mildness
and better taste... with an aroma and
flavor that connects every time.
