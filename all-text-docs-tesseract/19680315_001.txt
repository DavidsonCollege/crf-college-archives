Petition Receives

Slight Response

By ED HAY

The petition to abolish the
drinking rule is being circu-
lated at fraternity houses in
a last effort to secure more
signatures. according to
junior John Pancake, sponsor
of the petition.

“The response has been a
little disappointing. I hope

this second try at the frater-
nity houses will bring in more
signatures," said Pancake.
“I've been told that a great
number of people didn't see
the petition the first time
around."'

Although Pancake said he
would ‘‘not be disappointed’
with 500 sjgnatures, he plans
to submit it to the faculty be-
fore the spring break.

Student reluctance to sign
a petition, even though they
favored it, mystified him.

There is a good possibility,
according to Pancake, that
the drinking rule will be
changed. The changes in the
curriculum and regulations
sparked this optimism.

“The current rule is bad
psychologically,"" said Pan-
cake. “It doesn’t cut down on
the drinking. and may even
cause the students to drink
more.”

The rule, which has more
effect on campus life than to
just cut down on drinking, is
not fulfilling its purpose, ac-
cording to Pancake. He point.
ed out that there were no
“disastrous consequences at
Princeton when their drinking
rule was abolished.”

week.

Other parts of the report
will include a statement of
philosophy under which the
code is to be administered.
recommendations for the judi
cial system, and informal
suggestions for revision of
academic regulations and
minor rules.

The drinking rule, said
Carroll, is similar to the rule
at Haverford, which allows
for “‘the right of the individ-
ual to choose within the con.
text of the institution.”

Open meetings and at least
one Open End are to be held’
on the code of responsibility.
said Carroll. The report is
not to be formally submitted
until the first four parts are
completed, but will be pre.
sented to both the Student
Council and faculty at the
same time by the joint stu
dent-faculty committee.

Carroll emphasized that
next week's version is ‘‘only
a first draft."’ and said that
the CRAP committee will be
open to suggestions from ‘‘all
members of the college com-
munity."

Symposia

The upcoming Reynolds
Symposium will be David

type in a number of years.
according to Dr. James S.
Purcell Jr.

Apparently there is some
student. interest in having
future symposia at Davidson

several candidates in the
recent clections wrote in
“symposium planks” in their
platforms.

The Reynolds Symposium
was orginally planned  ‘‘as
the literary part of a week of
cullural activities."’ said Pur-
cell, professor of English.
The. other activities “did not
materialize,’ he added.

The cultural week was to
be “something of a replace.
ment’ for the annual Fine
Arts Festival. “‘one of the
oldest traditions we had,"
Purcell said. Last spring's
20th Fine Arts Festival. was
the last program of the ser-
ies; and no committee was
named this year to continue

George Core. English in-
structor and Reynolds Sym

out the advantages of a sym
posium. ‘‘Any one speaker. no
matter how good. may he
stale on any one occasion. He
may have a headache ‘or

Reynolds Talks

Change

A symposium on modern
Southern literature Monday
and Tuesday will replace the
traditional one-speaker, three-
speech format of the Rey-
nolds Lecture series.

Three speakers. Dr. C.
Hugh. Holman and Dr. Louis
D. Rubin Jr. of the University
of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill and Prof. Walter Sullivan
of Vanderbilt University, will
discuss various aspects of
the symposium's theme, ‘'Is
Southern Literature Still Rele-
vant?"’

Each speaker will present
a critical paper for the Rey-
nolds Lecture program. A
symposium,. moderated by
George Core. English instruc-
tor and symposium coordina-
tor, will end the two-day pro.
gram.

These men are ‘‘authorities
in the field’ and come from
schools that ‘“‘have shown sus-
tained interest in Southern
literature," according to Dr.
James S. Purcell Jr., pro-
fessor of English.

He said Holman’s sympos-
ium paper will probably deal
with social issues as present
ed in Southern litérature.
Sullivan will present a con.
trasting viewpoint the re-
treat of Southern. literature
into aestheticism.

Rubin will present - the
thesis that both aestheticism

existed in Southern literature.

At least five works by four
Southern authors will be dis-
cussed in the symposium:
“Absalom. Absalom!’ and
“Light in August."’ novels by
William Faulkner; “You
Can't Go Home Again,”” a
novel by Thomas Wolfe: and
‘YA Good Man Is Hard to
Find.”’ a collection of stories
by Flannery O'Connor: and

Saturday Concert Altered

In order to allow students
to watch the NCAA regional
play offs tomorrow evening.
entertainer Glenn Yarbrough
has agreed to change the time
of his concert to tomorrow
afternoon.

Social Council Chairman
Charles Cameron said the
concert, originally scheduled
for 8 p.m., has been moved
to 4 p.m. He announced the
change after talking with the
managers of the Yarbrough
tour.

“‘We wanted a good crowd
for the concert.’’ Cameron
said, ‘“‘and we knew that a
number of students would
want to watch the game on
television. With this arrange.
ment they can do both.”

Cameron described Yar.
brough as ‘‘a consistent sell-
er in the LP division.”’ He
has produced nine albums.

His latest album, ‘‘Honey
and Wine.”’ was released in
November. Along with many
of his other albums, it fea.
tures the poetry of contem-
porary poet Rod McKuen.
