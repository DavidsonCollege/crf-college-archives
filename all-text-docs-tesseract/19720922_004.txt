Cops On Campus

It is gratifying to find that problems presented to
the college are sometimes met with positive actions
by the administration. An example is the concern
students exhibited last year about security on cam-
pus. Based in part on suggestions made by THE
DAVIDSONIAN and the Senate, the administration
has instituted a new system of campus security.

Lighting is already improved by a new string of
lampposts stretching from the new College Union to
the mammoth hole beside Duke. That these lights are
temporary and experimental proves the college to be
more concerned for safety than for protecting the
image of some elaborate, and theoretical plan drawn
up in an office in Charlotte.

The ‘‘hiring”’ of the Davidson town police, through a
program which allows the college to pay half the
salaries of the men, is an answer to the problem
which may cause some anxieties among students - the
sight of a police car is always a sobering experience.

But too often people are ready to condemn what
they do not really know or understand, too many
students assume that every man in uniform is out to
get him.

In fact, the inclusion of the campus onto the beat of
experienced and responsible policemen can make
Davidson a safer place to walk from one building to
another, and a more secure place to leave a room
unlocked. The assurances that the police are not to en-
ter the dormitories unless asked to do so by students,
and the expressed position that they are to concern
themselves primarily with outsiders rather than with
students, should be taken seriously by students.

Mutual trust is an essential element of any stable
society. It is our belief that the primary responsibility
for developing trust at Davidson is in the hands of the
students, and we hope that students will not blow a
chance at creating a positive attitude toward the
security force.

If students take the initiative in building mutual
trust, the campus can be made a more secure, safe,
and pleasant place to live. If the system breaks down
in its initial stages because of student prejudice, the
students have no one to blame but themselves.

Orientation

One of the finest manifestations of small college life
is the personal attention which can be given to every
student. Ideally this personal attention should begin
as early in a student’s career as possible.

To this end Davidson provides one of the most in-
novative, informative, and satisfying orientation
programs of any college. Gone are the days when a
freshman’s parents tearfully leave their young son in
the hands of semi-sadistic upperclassmen and hall
counselors more concerned with money than morale.

In the place of all this is a program which involves
parents as will as students, a program that provides a
kind of semi-separation which serves to inform and
encourage parents and to provide at least part of
home for the student’s first harrowing hours of
college life.

The creators and planners of this year’s orien-
tation, Dean of Students Will H. Terry and Freshman
Advisors Skip Holcombe and Rob Krebs deserve high
compliments for the time and effort expended by
them to provide for the highly successful orientation
just ended.

But there have been complaints from some about
the general lack of preparation for coed orientation, a
deficiency which showed itself most clearly in the in-
sufficient assistance given coeds in preparing course
schedules (supposedly one married student was to
provide advice to all fifty new women). Admittedly,
any new program takes trial and error to perfect, and
first times for anything are seldom pleasant, but to
ask young women onto campus without counselors
and an especially comprehensive orientation
program is difficult to justify.

Mott The Wopple, Numb Elroy
Still Live In The Postnight

With the college bul—
dging with studentry once
more, I have begun to wonder
what drew me back to the cam-
pus so early, along with so
many others who came sur-
prisingly several weeks before
classes. You seniors, juniors
and sophomores will doubtless
wonder, too.

But Davoidson has a curious
attraction, especially postnight
Davoidson (postnight, gentle
freshmen, is the time from 2
a.m. to6a.m., when the campus
really lives). At first 1 thought
it was Numb Elroy (Numb
Elroy, gentle co-eds, sits naked
in a semi-lotus atop the famed
Davoidson fountain, master of
the postnight). Then, last post-
night, at mystic 4 a.m. to be
exact, I found the answer.

As I crossed the quad, I came
upon Don Guappo Lasagne and
his henchman, a. tearful
Katamite Kayrat, standing
over Kayrat’s wounded steed
Rosinante. When I asked what
had happened, they muttered,
‘He has come.”

Farther along I began to hear
a chant from the steps of Cham-
bers: We must... we
must...we-must-We-Must-WE-.
MUST!" And near Eu Hall, |
found former senator Rowland
writhing on the ground, covered
with green stains, his mouth
twitching soundlessly. He had
had a nervectomy! Scrawled in
the dirt beside his now useless
right hand was “HE HAS
COME."

Finally, I came to the foun-
tain and Numb Elroy. half-
strangled with vines and broad,
green leaves, his palest of pale
body smeared green. I steadied
him on the derelict pedestal and
bent my ear to his quivering
lips.

“The Cockasnook has flown to
our bastion in the North,” he
gasped. ‘‘Flakely the Cat has
been swallowed up. It has hap-
pened. He has come.”’

A trail of leaves leading from
the fountain and the chants
AGAIN: “‘WE Must...we must...

We — must — We — Must— WE
— MUST." I followed these to
the steps of chambers, and

there in the glove of spotlights I
saw him.

Ringed bv deans and doctors
with garlands of dollar wreaths
and the ‘Green Book of
Bureaucracy.’ he stood forty
feet tall, a mass of leaves and
vines, spreading, spreading
over co-eds, two by two, who
danced ‘‘The Library Game,”
spreading over freshmen, bun-
ch by bunch, who danced “The
Grade-Point Game,”
spreading, tortuous: King Kud-
zu!

“We must,"’ said deans and
doctors, ‘‘we-must-grow-and-
we-WILL!"’

“Dance!"’ King Kudzu chan-
ted. “Dance! Dance! Dance!”

I crept closer to hear more of
what King Kudzu said. Even as
I did, his vines slithered closer
to me. Entwined and oriented,
his victims danced. The deans
and doctors sang with King
Kudzu in the lead.
‘*We-must-grow-and-we-
WILL. We-must-grow-and-we-
WILL! Open your books,”’ cried
King Kudzu, ** to chapter num-
ber one. ‘The Care and Feeding
of Students’ is your primary
concern. When they come to
you for mercy, to continue to
learn, give them none. When
they study all summer to stay in
school, pick their nits and let
them burn.”

‘‘We must...we must...we-
must-We-Must-WE-MUST!"

*‘When they crawl to you for
money, throw it down the
nearest well. Or horde it
without telling them in ap-
propriate disquise. Don't let
them know when vou owe them,
and they can never tell; when
they finally come, blame the
error on them, and they can
never get wise.”

“We must...we must...wé
must-We-Must-WE-MUST!""

“We must,” cried King Kud-
zu, “we must...we must grow
and we WILL! fatten tne
students on baubles and sport,
feed them on raisins and figs.
Give them no doctor but soothe
their wounds and never let one
fall ill. I'll spread as I please

and gorge whom I may and feed
myself long pig.”’

‘‘We must...we must...we
must...”’

‘*Must we?" asked one doc-
tor. King Kudzu shot out a leafy
arm and pulled him into the
jungle of vines. I heard mun-
ching. Immediately I ran to
Main Street, where five shiny,
new police cars had gathered.
When I told them about King
Kudzu, they smiled and pointed
to their leaf-shaped badges and
the dollar wreaths on their
heads. And when I turned
around, the leaves had engulfed
the campus. I ran into Castle
Pinky.

“If the police can't handle
this, I'll turn to Don GUAPPO,*
I thought. He was inside with
Katamite Kayrat.

“Well, if it ain’t Mott the Wop-
ple,”’ he said to me. I told him
what I'd seen. ‘tHe has come,"
he said and pointed out the win-
dow. Outside, Davoidson was
green. I could hear the Chorus
of Kudzu.

“Dance! Dance! Dance!"’

Katamite Kayrat turned to
me and said, ‘‘Mistah Kudzu, he
alive!"

And as the leaves spread with
rhyme but no reason, the bells
of Chambers forboded that The
Year of Kudzu had come.
Again.
