One of Davidson’s best pitch-
ers turned double duty Saturday,
but one of the Southern
Conference’s best pitchers turned
the Wildcats back Sunday.

both ends of Davidson’s sweep of
a doubleheader Saturday against
Georgia Southern, the top team in
the conference. .

Butthe Eagles’ William Rush-
ing switched the tide Sunday as the
Wildcats lost 14-6.

“Certainly, if you can come
out of series against them with a
win you feel good,” Davidson
coach Dick Cooke said. “They’rea
real solid team.”

Picked by many to win the
conference, Georgia Southern
came into Davidson in first place.
Following Davidson’s 3-2 and 5-1
wins Saturday, the Eagles dropped
into second place.

The Wildcats now stand at 14-
19 and 9-9 in the Southern Confer-
ence.

The weekend series followed
a7-6 loss Tuesday at Georgia Tech
for the Wildcats.

In that game, the Yellow Jack-
ets squeaked out the win on an
eighth inning single. Davidson had
scored five runs in the fourth to get
back in the game.

The game continued a string
of solid performances by Davidson
against Atlantic Coast Conference
schools that included a win over
Wake Forest.

“We always seem to play well
down there (at Georgia Tech),”
Cooke said. “This is one of the
toughest schedules we’ ve played
since I’ ve been here. I think that if
you face some of the ACC arms
early in the season, then once you
get into conference play, you’ ll be
better off.”

In the game against Georgia
Tech, senior captain Mark Reilly
suffered a terrible season-ending
injury, dislocating his elbow and
thumb. He was coming over from
second to cover first on a bunt play
and reached out for the throw when
the runner smacked into him. The

Rugby team finds tough
luck in State Tournament

By RIcH GLENN

The rugby team took the field
for the final time this spring on
Saturday. Davidson and UNCC co-
hosted the North Carolina State
Rugby Tournament this weekend
and invited six other teams in order
to determine the best college rugby
team in the state.

RUGBY

The tournament is normally.

held at Eastern Carolina but due to
scheduling conflicts ECU was
forced to cancel. But through a
joint Davidson and UNCE effort

the tournament was held on both.

Davidson and UNCC fields.

Duke, North Carolina, N.C.
State, Appalachian State, ECU and
Western Carolina all made their
way to the piedmont this weekend
for the tournament.

Davidson faced Duke in its
first game, and it turned out to bea
great game. While Davidson domi-
nated the first half, the team
couldn’t convert any the opportu-
nities they created, and at halftime
there was no score.

The second half went the same
way as Davidson continued to play
well. Seniors Jeremy Potter, Tom
Shelburne and Simon Priestley all
played great games to lead
Davidson, which passed very well
all game.

Sophomores Chris Smith and
Thayer Long led the way on the
defensive side, each making sev-
eral key tackles. With under ten

minutes left, the game was still
scoreless, Priestly had a chance to
put Davidson on top with a field
goal opportunity but the angle was
too tough, and the kick barely
missed. .

Minutes later, Duke made a
try and then converted the kick to
take a 7-0 lead. There wasn’t
enough time to mounta comeback,
and the game ended with Duke

' winning 7-0. “The game really

could have gone either way. Both
teams played tough,” said a blood-
ied Thayer Long.

The team had to look ahead,
though, as the next game was un-
der an hour away. This match was
against N.C, State and was also
very closely contested. Potter and
Priestley both had outstanding

games, and Sean Callahan and_

Mike Kessler put on some big hits
throughout the game.

Potter made a diving try with
three minutes remaining in the first
half to put Davidson up 5-0. NC
State scored and converted mid-
way through the second half to
make the score 7-5. But Davidson
reclaimed the lead as Priestley
made a penalty kick to make the
score 8-7 Davidson.

However, in the closing min-
utes, the Wolfpack made a penalty
kick to take the lead for good. It
was another game that could have
gone either way for Davidson.

Davidson had nothing to feel
badly about as they played very
well all day but luck just wasn’t on
their side. N.C. State was very big
and had a slight advantage in that
respect. However, it was clear to
the crowd that Davidson had better
skills. “N.C. State looked like they
robbed a cattle ranch on the way

down here," added a bitter Frank
“Falcon Killer” Killian.

Astiredas all the players were,
the day wasn’t over. The team
packed up and headed for UNCC
to play Western Carolina. Against
Western, Davidson put it all to-
gether. Priestley scored a try after
a penalty in the first half, and Pot-
ter scored twice late in the game to
break the game open.: The final
score was 19-10.

Another important player in
the Western game was Craig
Murphy, who did a great job grab-
bing the ball in the lineup. The
