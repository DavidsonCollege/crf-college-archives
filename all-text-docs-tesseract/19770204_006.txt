‘Lawrimore defines WDAV proposal

By PHILIP DUNCAN ©
News Editor

Q. Tell us about the plans to
increase WDAV’s power and
range.

A. The trustees expressed
interest some time ago in
exploring the possibility of
increasing the power of the
radio station.

We worked with engineers
and decided that the best
opportunity in terms of the
broadcast spectrum was an
18,000-watt station at 89.9 on
the FM dial.

The Transcontinental Gas
Pipeline Company north of
here agreed to let us use their
tower. The engineers recom-
mended we microwave the
signal from campus to the
tower. (The broadcast waves
will reach the Greater Char-
lotte area.) .

Estimated cost of boosting
the power is $52,000. That .is
the minimum that could be
spent if the college decides,
with the approval of the
trustees, to opt for the high
power.

At latest word from the
FCC there have been no
problems with our application
whatsoever, and we expect
they will make a final decision
by the end of February.

Q. What in addition to high
power is being considered?

A. There’s almost an unlim-
ited number of options. Some
improvements in the present
studio equipment seem advis-
able, but at this point it’s a big
question as to how much can

‘be justified.

It also seems advisable to
have some member of the
college staff more directly
involved in the day-to-day
operation of the station—a
station manager.

Another question is the
engineering situation—the
man who is now the WDAV
engineer (Paul Sealy) would
very much like to work with
the new station.

Do we add these staff
members, and, if so, on what
basis—part-time, _ full-time?
That’s another question in
this.

There is one other question
~whether or not we buy
automated equipment (com-
puter equipment and pre-pro-
grammed tapes) which would
probably be necessary during
holidays and summertime
when students wouldn’t be
around to run the station.

Q. How can this expendi-
ture for the radio station be
justified in light of other
priorities—Martin Science.
eating and living facilities, for
example?

A. The big difference is Be,

we expect the radio station
will bring money to the col-
lege.

There’s a general feeling
that there would be great
public relations benefit to the
college if we provided high-
quality music and educational
programming.

Q. The automated computer
equipment enables an overseer
to put on a tape of pre-re-
corded programming and
leave the station essentially
unattended for up to three
days while the program runs.
How will the purchase of auto-
mated equipment affect the
present WDAV staff of 55.

A. I don’t like the idea of
saying to the current staff; ‘‘X
number of you are going to
lose your jobs.” That is a very
negative approach. —

- What. I want to say is

Lawrimore

‘‘Here’s what we hope to
accomplish with this radio
station. We would like your
suggestions as to how this
might best be done, using
students as much as practi-
cal.’’

If it’s possible that good
quality which speaks well for
the college is possible with 55
people participating, that’s
fine.

It’s the quality that is the
goal.

Q. What kind of program-
ming will be planned if the
high power station is ap-
proved?

A. That is also a matter of
discussion. Jack Golden and I
talked about this when he was

‘station manager and the gen-

eral idea was, in the morning,
album cuts that the students
want to hear.

In late morning and early
afternoon, verbal educational
programming, and classical
music from early afternoon
until mid-evening. Then al-
bum cuts, whatever the stu-
dents would like to play, after
ten o’clock.

The basic program would
not be much different from the
present program, except for a
little more classical music.

I think the students’ main
concerns are a) we lose our
extracurricular activity as we

have come to know and love it;
and b) we think the college
ought to spend the money on
the chemistry building.

r. Spencer and I and the
fre people with these ideas
+-we’re not boogeymen out to
see how we can mess up
students’ lives, and we're try-
ing to explore what’s in the
teat interests of the college.

We don’t view this as a
multi-thousand dollar retieti
to pour money in. If it turns
out that the cons outweigh the
pros, the project will probably
be abandoned.

Q. What has Dr. Spencer
told you about his ideas in this
matter?

A. Dr. Spencer favors the
establishment of a high power
quality programming station
with a maximum degree of
student involvement. He be-
lieves control by faculty and
staff should be minimized.

He had no qualms about the
basic high power package,
which costs $52,000. He be-
lieves the benefits will be
substanuial enough to justify
the expenditure.

He has some questions a-
bout the operating budget and
the part-time/full-time status
of the paid staff members, and

faculty to get their opinion in

The staff at WDAV has
heard conflicting stories about
what is involved in the in-
creased wattage move. “I’ve
never been told what's really
going on in one piece,” Sid
Barrett, station manager,
comments, “‘We’ye heard so
many bits and pieces that any
idea we've heard is conceiv-
able.”
Barrett elaborates on the
ideas he has heard. Paul
Sealy, the station’s engineer,
tells him the move will require
a minimum of $100,000.
$50,000 will go to the trans-
mitting equipment, which in-
cludes transmitter, tower, and
micro-wave relay system to
send the signal from the Union
to the Transco Gas Pipeline
tower. $2000 will go toward
the initial music package.

Communication breakdown results in radio station

By KEVIN SHELLY
Special Projects Editor

There’s an interesting play being
put on, some might even call it a
power play. The principal characters
are Buck Lawrimore, Sam Spencer,
Sid Barrett, Jack Golden, and Paul
Sealy, a new discovery.

There are also sixty bit parts, but
as of now they don’t have any lines.
And they might not get any at all.
It’s hard to say because right now
this play lacks both a director and an

_2uthor and the princip pales are in no

way prepared to pull a successful
improvisation.

A lot of misinformation has been
spread and none of the actors seem to
know what the others are saying.
Jack Golden, the former WDAV
station manager, knew of plans to up
the wattage for quite a while. But he
did not explain anv details tn the new
manager, Sid Barrett, before he
jaunted off to Europe last month.

Sid Barrett, who was largely unin-
formed, thought a closet-coup was
being formulated and prep to do
battle with a nebulous nemesis.

Paul Sealy, presently engineering
consultant for WDAV and likely to
take over that position full-time if the
transition occurs, is spreading misin-
formation to present WDAV staff
members for no apparent reason.

Buck Lawrimore, whose interest in
the rt Sh -over is large but unde-

fined, is on record of having said that
the ‘‘new”’ station will be the “Update
of the airwaves”’.

Sam Spencer, who thinks the new
format and upped wattage will in-
crease financial contributions to the
college, reacted to the furor that the
proposal has caused by saying, ‘“‘I am
startled by the student reaction, I
thought they knew about it and were
excited.”’

Everyone seems to be excited, but
because the major characters have so
miserably failed to communicate with
each other, no one is exactly sure
what there is to be excited about.
These five characters need a director
now.

The cost of upping the wattage to
18,000 watts will be about $52,000.

, That is damn expensive considering

the pressing needs of the school and
its declining educational facilities.

é a

But Spencer terms the move,
“Money sent after money’’, hoping to
draw increased attention and money
from a Charlotte that has embraced
UNCC and CPCC in Davidson's
place.

Maybe it will draw money, but
Spencer seems to have missed the
point. A group of 60 students are now
involved in WDAV, and have almost
complete control of their programs.

If the change to more classical

_ Music is, instituted the number of

students involved will be reduced and
those with shows between noon and 8
pm will be greatly constrained in what

they can play, and if a professional -

manager/programmer is hired he
could oversee all the programs, if that
is what the administration decided
on.

Spencer's comment about WDAV
as it is now and as it could be is

a

revealing. He said the new station is
an ‘opportunity for Davidson stu-
dents to do something professional,
rather than having WDAV just a play
thing.” Others in the administration,
including Development Vice Presi-
dent, Dwayne Dittman, have referred
to the station as a toy.

That is a frightening attitude to be
coming from the administration and
seems largely to be a rationalization
of their position, whatever that may
be.

The unanswered questions are
many: By how much will the staff be
cut? Will there be a professional
manager, or will the station still be
student-run?

How much control will students
have Over individual programs? How
many educational shows will be
produced here, rather: fobs ou
already prepared? Will this actus
