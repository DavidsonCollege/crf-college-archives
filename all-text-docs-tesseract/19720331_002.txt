by Him to preach to. to com-
municate to, and to save the
lost

He added that a person's com-
mitment to God should be a
real and passionate belief, not
merely an intellectual approach.

A basis for world outreach
exists, Said Haggai, for two rea-
sons: 1) Jesus has commanded
us to preach to all the world:
2) am enlightened self-interest
as Christians and Americans.

Haggai finished his first lec-
ture by stating that it is ‘time
to take Jesus directly from Je-
rusalem to the point of action
instead of routing Him through
Western Europe and America.”

Tuesday's lecture, entitled
“Jesus Christ Super—What,”
dealt with the fact that Christ
is the only qualified religious

leader who can meet man in
the totality of his need.

“Overwhelming evidence con-
cludes that Christ was more
than man: He was God,” stated
Haggai.

Some of the evidence given
was the promises of a seed to
Abraham which lasted for 42
generations, a promise given
when Abraham was 100 and
Sara, his wife, was 90.

Also listed as evidence was
the miraculous prophecy given
naming Bethlehem as the birth-
place of Jesus over 700 years in
advance.

Haggai further stated that
Christ is the only religious lead-
er to have ever walked away
from his own tomb.

for student aid will constitute
6.7 per cent of the 197773 in
come.

Cornell reported that this will
involve a $225 increase ino stu
dent tuition next year, pu'ting
the total cost at approvima.cly
$3,390.

Cornell felt that this figure
will place the college on a1 even
par with Davidson's stiffest pri
vate school competition, both in
the South and in the Northesst.

Also this week, in regard to a
presentation on March 14. by
former SGA President Denny
Clodfelter, urging senave mem
bers to consider a vossible par
ticipation in the National Stu-
dent Lobby (NSL), the SGA
appropriated £50 to bring a re-
presentative of the organization
to Davidson in imid-Apri!

The senate also gave its a
tention to Junior Senator Bill
Meier who delivered a_ report
concerning recent attempts of
the SGA to place stuclent repre
sentation on the BBGC.

It was discovered by Meier
that the proposal of such stu-
dent representation would re-
quire three readings b; the
Faculty Exectrive Commitiee
(FEC) which in all probability
that was circulated on March
21.

Upon Meier's suggestion. the
SGA postponed action along
this line until the fall of 972.

At this point. the Special Sen
ate Committee on Carapus Se
curity, chaired by Mitch Fur
vis, reported on the results of
a Campus security questonaire
that was circulated on March
21.

Of the 800 questionaires dix
tributed, 115 replies were re.
ceived by the committee, 4 of
which indicated ineidences of
cither theft or encoumer.

Nearly half of the replies ex
pressed a belief that the secur
itv problem is a serious onc
at this point and many offered
suggestions to improve the sit
uation. °

The questionaire also bore out
the fact that the overwheluing
majority of theit incidences on
campus occur in the dormitories
and to a lesser decree, in the
parking areas.

So far this vear, °+1 worth
of merchandise has been stolen
on the campus.

As mentioned earlier. many
replics to the questionaire of
fered suggestions whicl: might
serve to allieviate the problem.
Among these are the placing
of the campus off-limits to out
siders. an enlarged security for
ce, student patrols. increased
lighting. the locking of dorms
during vacations and increasing
encouragement of students to
better secure valuables.

FEC Changes New

Academic Calendar

The Faculty Executive Com.
mittee (FEC) met this week and
decided to adjust mext year’s
calendar so that the first day of
classes for the winter term will
be Jan. 3 instead of Jan. 2, ac-
cording to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

The committee’s action was
in response to a recommenda-
tion submitted by Freshman

-.. Student Input Needed

(Continued From Page 1)
argued that students should not
be allowed a meaningful role in
governance since students, they
Say, Cannot keep matters con-
fidential.

‘It is true there are cases
where students have not been
able to keep their mouth shut,
bu: historical observation clear-
ly demonstrates that faculty
members as well as administra-
tors are just as guilty of this
failing and in mnay cases have
violated confidence more often
than students have.

Students cannot become re-
sponsible unless they are en-
trusted with responsibility to
begin with. The only way stu-
dents are going to grow is if
they are continually challenged
to bear the burden of responsi-
bility.

Students should have a mean-
ingful role in governance in or-
der that they too may contrib-
ute to the college. Their frus-
trations with the _ institution
might subside once they realize
how the college works.

Students don’t want to run the
school. They have neither the
time, the patience nor the ex-
perience to do so. But as mem.

bers of the college community,
they are entitled to a meaning-

ful input in the governance of
the college.

Governance should not be a
contest between constituencies,
but rather it should be an en-
deavor in which these groups
Creatively search for new ways

to achieve the goals of the col-
lege.

Students do have a contribu-
tion to make and students have
a right to a meaningful input

in college governance at David-
son.

Senator Vince Rabil.

Student opposition to the Jan.
2 starting date, based on the
dangerous travel conditions of
the New Year's weekend,
prompted Rabil to appeal to the
SGA Senate and from there,
with the Senate’s endorsement,
to the FEC.

Rabil’s plan called for a sec
ond extra Saturday class to be
addded later in the term, but
the committee approved anoth-
er solution.

“The science departments arc
not in favor of Saturday class-
es,” explained Spencer, ‘‘be-
cause of the difficulty in sched-
uling lab periods then. We de-
cided to add the day to the end
of the term, which will now end
on Friday, March 9 rather than
Thursday, March 8.”

Although amending the winter
term starting date was the only
definite action taken by the
committee this week, Vice Pres
ident for Academic Affairs John
M. Bevan expressed his desire
that the whole calendar be re
considered next year.

. + + Football Report Criticism

still be running a first class pro-
Bram, with no cutbacks in
coaches’ salaries for example.
The costs for coaching and re.
cruitment would be about the
same,” he said.

As to his personal opinion of
Subsidized football, Bevan sta
tec, “I believe in subsidized
football if the institution cn af-
ford it and it is included in the
goals and aspirations of the ‘col-
lege.

Football is an auxiliary enter-

prise. It has nothing to do with
academic curriculum. It is :acst
ly P. R.." Bevan said.

Cornell noted that “1 an: com
pletely open on the question “sy
only concern is whether wil 52
Scholarships, we can still win
the Southern Conference.”

With regard to the Cammittec
Report, SGA President Ralph
Peeples noted that although the
committee made no recommend-
ation on the question of subsi-
dized football, they did an ad-
mirable job.
