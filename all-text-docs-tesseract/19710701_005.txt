McGeachy had _ filled both
roles.

“Neill did a very good job
for us at Davidson,”’ said
Holland.

“We are not opening the
job. It's set as far as we're
concerned. There ‘are major
changes taking place in the
program, but we're not

ready to say what they are.
We are going to hire a fresh-
man coach as wel as a
conch to do the recruiting.

Carolinas ‘Conference honors

America as a football re-

MINI SUMMER JOCKS
Camps Program

If you heard the patter of
little feet at Davidson this
summer, chances are that
‘hose feet were shod in ten-
nis shoes.

For the second year David-
son College sponsored a

Fogleman To Lecture
At Forest Hills Clinic

Davidson tennis coach
Harry Fogleman will be one
of the guest lecturers at the
National Tennis Teachers
Conference to be held at

Forest Hills, New York,
September 2 - 5.
Fogleman will speak on

the four days of the confer-
ence, lecturing on diverse
topics including strategy,
college level coaching, and
practice methods.

The clinic, which is to be
an auunal event, is timed to
coincide with the United
States Open championship
at Forest Hills. The confer-
ence is open to all tennis
teachers, coaches and pro-
fessionals.

Fogleman is no stranger
to tennis clinics. He was one
of tthe organizers and in-
structors in the first clinic
ever held ‘in the United
States.

His second annual Wildcat
tennis Camp wrapped up op-
erations after four one week
sessions. A special session
was designed to improve the
play and strategy of nation-
ally ranked players.

As a college coach Fogle-
man has compiled a 384-130
record with teams at Flori-
da, Duke, Cincinatti and
Davidson. His Davidson
teams have won the South-
ern Conference title six of
the last seven seasons.

comprehensive set of sum-
mer athletic agamps which
drew youngsters of ail ages
to the campus for imstruc-
tion in their favorite sport.
Camps were heid for tennis,
football, baseball and basket-
bail. ;

In addition to Davidson's
usual complement of male
campers, Harry Fogleman's
temmis camp also brought a
number of female partici-
pants who also stayed in the
residence hails.

Coexistence wiih Davidson
summer students was peace-
able, with relations smoothed
by the nightly movies which
were part of the camps’ pro-
gram.

Athletic Business Manager

Frederick Outlaw was the
director of the camp pro-

gram and seemed quite
._pleased with maximum en-

roliment, an improvement
over ‘ast year's initial oper-
ation. In addition to the
benefits for the campers
Outlaw pointed to the bene-
fits which accrue to David-
son College as a result of the
summer program. Chief

With graduation again tak-
ing, a heavy toll, including
Thompsen, Mikolayunas and
Lyon, Bagg again faces a
heavy rebuilding task jas fall
practice commences.

The Wildcats’ new face on
the coaching staff, Ernie
Tall, will share ‘the task of
rebuilding the offense with
Fagg.

Tall, 24, ‘has five years of
coaching experience on the
collegiate level. As ‘a fresh
man at Western Michigan
he sustained a knee injury
wlach ended his playing ca-
reer. Tall coached freshmen
and redshirts three years at
Western Michigan and anoth-
er two years as a graduate
assistan: at South Carolina.

Early indications from the
spring practice sessions are
that the Wildcats may move
more on tthe ground than
they have in the past. While
Thompson, Slade and Jimmy
Poole have been setting pass-
ing marks for tthe past six
seasons, the ground game
‘has been less than impres-
sive.

Senior Johnny Ribet and
junior Bill Bracken may
have signaled the end of
Davidson's complete reliance
on the aerial game last fall
with 625 and 610 yards re-
epectively. The halfback
tandem picked up more
yardage rushing than any
Wildcat team since 1966 and
both are threats to erase the
school record for single sea-
son rushing yardage.

The Wildcats also face the

problem of replacing tthe en-
tire interior offensive line.
Guard Jim Ellison is tabbed
as all-Conference material.
Guard Robert Eliott, tackle
Larry Spears, and centers
Bill Nicklas and Jim Han-
kinson were also impressive
in spring drills.

High on the list. of priori-
ties for Fagg is shoring up
a defense which last year
yielded an ‘average of 30
points a contest. Bill Gar-
rett, a junior tackle, will
lead an all new line.

Linebacking jand tthe de-
fensive backfield are strong:
points with six returnees.
All three starting lineback-
ers, Woody Montgomery,
Robert Norris and John Bar-
bee, are all-Southern candi-
dates and Joe Poteat is just
a step behind.

Terry Woodlief, Tom Van-
d.ver and John Maloney are
counted on in the backfield.
