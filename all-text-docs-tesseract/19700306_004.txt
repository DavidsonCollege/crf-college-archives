Green Plays Lead
In ‘David And Lisa’

A REVIEW
By DAN GRAHAM

“David and Lisa’ had
only four ‘actors; ‘the set
wasn't much to look at; the
lighting effects were mini-
mal; and the story was
simple.

But the play, as the chalk
on the blackboard. said, told
it “PLAIN STRAYT.”

William Green carried the
lead magnificently as David,
a high-strung paranoid young

man, groping his® way to-
ward human warmth. With
each scene he has made
some slight, almost imper-
ceptible change toward his
goal.

"They Shoot Horses’ Asks

A REVIEW

By DON HOYT

Don’t They?”

you

* question
Shoot Horses,

The m players in the
vame are: Gloria (Jane Fon
da), an embittered young
woman: Robert (Michael Sar-
razin), a well-meaning, hap-
less young man; Alice (Su-
sannah’ York), a beautiful
but pathetically untalented
aspirant to Hollywood star-
dom: Sailor (Red Buttons),
an old hand at playing the
‘game, brought down in the

end by his age:-and- Rocky
(Gig Young), the team, phy-

Sician, coach, referee, score:
keeper, banker, and announ-
cer.

The conceit is this: the
world is a marathon dance,
all of the dancers at first
struggling to win,, but most

giving up or collapsing long
before achieving success at
the end.

What is the prize for the
winnér of the game?~ $1,500;
which may not sound like
much, but in 1932, during the
middle —of the Depression,
$1,500 was worth considerably
more than most of the things
for which people kill them-
selves_today.

A tawdry waterfront ball-
room in Santa Monica, Cali-
fornia, provides the perfect

sel

setting for this parable: about
life, even to the rotating tin

globe which hangs high

above the dance flour.

Within the eenfines of this
gymiasium-like
hall the players spend liter

phorically their entire lives.

But when Gloria realizes

his brains ‘out after seeing

perfect is its presentation of
the game theory of life. If,
“indeed, the world is a point-

Cecil Burney, President of
the RHC, says that he feels
the SLC has been empowered
to specify hours for
dorms. In his view, the SLC
is just as much within its
rights “to specify 24-hours
at to specify three.”

Former RHC _ President
Tom Opie, who helped to
write the RHA Constitution

and who with Burney deliver-
ed the open dorms proposal
to the SLC, expressed dis-
appointment with’ the SLC’s
adoption of the administration
interpretation.

Opie charged that the
“reason for Spencer’s desire
to take it to the trustees is
his opposition to the proposal
rather than that such a pro-
posed change exceeds the
authority of the SLC.”

Commenting on Spencer’s
Statement (see story on Page

Davidson _ noted that
the Student Army Training

campus in 1917, while ROTC
itself was established dur-
ing the 1919-1920 school year.
He cited the many honors
won by the school’s ROTC
unit over the years, includ-
ing the fact that Davidson
produced six Generals - in
World War Two.

In his brief statement: to

drop in nationwide’ enroll-

embroiled in a tremendous
controversy whether to

student fees which make up
over 30 per cent of the in-
come of the Daily Tar Heel,
Chapel Hill's campus news-
paper.

The newspaper's critics
charge that the paper prints
leftwing editorials, obsceni-
ty, and one-sided news
stories. State legislators,
trustees, and students have
all complained of this.

(Next month, 18,000 stu-
dents at Chapel Hill will
have a chance to vote in a
referendum on whether to
keep the compulsory contri-
butions. 1,700 students have
signed a petition calling for
a vote on the question,

University officials and
Daily Tar Heel staff mem-
bers generally feel that the
paper would go under with-
out the financial. support of
the compulsory fees.

On the other _ hand
Journalism Professor Walter
Spearman, who was editor
of the Tar Heel in 1928-1929,
feels that the paper has al-
ways been controversial and
is today full of “good give
and take"’ on the issues.

The Tar Heel was, cam

ly, the newspaper came un-

ently been one of the top 10
