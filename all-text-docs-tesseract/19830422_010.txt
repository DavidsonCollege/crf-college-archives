By JOHNNY EDWARDS

It is hard to believe that Murmur is
R.E.M.’s debut album, considering
the amount of enthusiasm they have
generated, especially around David-
son. They have managed to win Vil-
lage Voice’s award for single of the
year almost solely on the basis of an
EP, an obscure single, and their live
act. R.E.M.’s popularity comes froma
chemistry which few bands achieve: a
kinetic live show, strong melodies, a
rhythm section made for dancing, sim-
ple yet textured guitar, rarely under-
standable lyrics (which enable every-
one to attach their own significance to
them), and a vocal style which im-
mediately catches one’s attention.

Murmur does not vary much from
the old formula, but its superior pro-
duction makes it much better than the
EP Chronic Town. Where the EP’s
production is lackluster, milky, and
simplistic, the album's is creative.
crystal clear, and subtly complex. A
certain delicacy characterizes the ar-
rangements — every instrument,
voice, and dial twist is “just so,” mak-
ing the album understated but not
sparse. This is the way albums are sup-

The songs on Murmur are of the
same quality and consistency as
Chronic Town, often transcending it.
They destroy inhibition in an amazing
manner and, each in its own way,
make the listener feel all different
kinds of good, at times even childlike
emotions. There is the rallying com-
mitment of “Radio Free Europe” (the
Village Voice single), the reflective-
ness of “Perfect Circle,” the glee of
“We Walk,” and the exuberance of
“Sitting Still” (a personal favorite).
Here is a band that gets its profundity
from bypassing intellect and going
straight for the lymbic system.

By obscuring the lyrics except for
snatches referring to Moral Kiosks,
walking in woods, and elysian fields,
and by backing straightforward lead
vocals with unintelligible chants,
R.E.M encourages a sense of wonder,
perhaps bordering on mysticism, de-
signed for the nonrational in the lis-
tener. While many bands attempt to do
this, REM is among the few.that excel
at it. Their songs have such a universal
appeal, in fact, that parents, teenage
sisters, ultra-sophisticated college stu-
dents, and even small children can
enjoy them.
