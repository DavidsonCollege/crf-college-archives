The Poetry of Maya Angelou

Child Dead in Old Seas

Father,

I wait for you in oceans

tides washing pyramids high
above my head.

Waves, undulating

corn rows around my

black feet.

The heavens shift and

stars find holes set

new in dark infirmity.

My search goes on.

Dainty shells on ash-like wrists
of debutantes remember you.
Childhood’s absence has

not stilled your

voice. My ear

listens. You whisper

on the watery passage.

Deep dirges moan
from the

belly of the sea

and your song

floats to me

of lost savannahs
green and

drums. Of palm trees bending
woman-like swaying
grape-blue children
laugh on beaches

of sand as

white as your bones
clean

on the foot of

long-ago waters.

Father.

I wait for you
wrapped in
the entrails of
whales. Your
blood now
blues

spume

over

the rippled
surface of our

grave.

from OhPray My Wings are Gonna
Fit Me Well

In Retrospect

Last Year changed its seasons .
subtly, stripped its sultry winds
for the reds of dying leaves,.let
gelid drips of winter ice melt onto
a

warming earth and urged the dor-
mant

bulbs to brave the pain of spring.

We, loving, above the whim of
time, did not notice.

Alone. 1 remember now.

from And Still I Rise

from Just Give MeaCoolDrink
of Water Before I Diie

My Guilt

My guilt is “‘slavery’s chains,”
too long

the clang of iron falls down the
years.

This brother’s sold. This sister’s
gone

is bitter wax, lining my ears.
My guilt made music with the
tears.

My crime is “heroes, dead and
gone”

dead Vesey, Turner, Gabriel,
dead Malcolm, Marcus, Martin
King.

They foughttoo hard, they loved
too well.

My crime is I’m alive to tell.

My sinis “hanging from a tree”
I do not scream, it makes me
proud.

I take to dying like a man.

I do it to impress the crowd.
My sin lies in not screaming
loud.

Permission from Lordley &
Dame.
