Capricious ’Cat Report:

Ney Not Underachieving

After a year, how does our mascot look? THE DAVIDSONIAN decided to try
and find out this week whether or not our wildcat has hit a sophomore slump after

his year in the Carolina Piedmont.

Now that the results of the
investigation are in, Dean Burts
and the faculty can relax. Wild-

cat lovers can relax. Peter
Stuart Ney IV is not. under-
achieving.

In fact. he has done quite
well publicity-wise for the col-
lege. When he went to spend
his vacation at Charlotte's Na-
ture Museum, WBT-TV was on
hand to get film shots of the

since his capture. He delighted
them by rolling over and over
on the good earth in the alliga-
tor's cage. The cage was com-
pletely equipped with every-
thing the cat needed for a com-
fortable living. Only the alliga-
tor was missing.

it was not very long before
Davidson’s mascot became the
museum’s top drawing card,

nn i

Even some of the directors
went out one night, just to
see Peter Stuart Ney.

They entered the rabbit's
cage, next ‘to where their star
attraction lay sleeping in the
alligator's pool. (Thought fe-
lines hate water? Ours is no dif-
ferent. No alligator, no water in
the pool.)

As the honored visitors
turned to watch the rabbits,
the cat charged from the de-
pression, stood on his hind
legs, and clawed the wire
separating the startled guests
from him. The next day a new
sign graced the front of the
cage: “Danger, Wild Animal,
Keep Three Feet Back.”

The incident did not cause
the cat to lose tenure. But in
the last half of the summer, he
did lose the star’s role—to a

. penguin. Again an old adage

was proven, no matter how good
you are, there is always some-
one better who comes along.
But a penguin?

In an article released in the
Charlotte Observer this morn-
ing, a Duke Power official de-
clined to comment on the asser-
tion that “a sizable tract of
lakeshore property ... has been
set.aside for Davidson students,
faculty, and alumni.” He said
only that officials of the col-
lege had indicated an interest in
a site and that informal talks
had been held.

Business Manager Robert A.
Currie was probably nearer to
the truth than he knew when
he stated in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN last week that, “The un-
fortunate thing at this time is
that we don’t know exactly how
much land Duke Power will
give us behind our shoreline.”

The story in the bulletin re-
lates the plans and work that
are already in progress on the

site. Besides facilities previously
reported in last’ week’s DAV-
IDSONIAN, it lists as “under
consideration,” a lakeshore
amphitheatre for classis drama
and concerts and shelters for
summer seminar groups.

The bulletin story also states
that “It is probable that David-
son will ‘have a. crew for inter-
collegiate competition -and re-
gattas.”

Martin is not a bit sorry

WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES

Now that. you have enrolled and paid your fees and boucht
your books and found your way around eatnyius and learned to
hate your roommnnte, it ix time to turn to the most’ important
aspect: of college life. I refer,.of course, to-clothes.

What does Dame Fashion decree-for the coming school year?
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many. people believe. a
fictitious ehameter. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.
Daring the invasion of the Spanish Annada, Dame Fashton—
not vet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country Inss ‘nuned
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I gay, of the Spanish
Arinada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping nrorale of
the British fleet with this stirring poem of her own composition

Don’t be gutless,
Men of Britain.
Swing your cutlass,
We-ain’t quiltin’.
Smash the Spanish,
Sink thetr boats,
Make ‘em vanish,

T ‘ke @ horse makes oats.

For Good Queen Bess,
Dear sirs, you gotta
Make a mess
Of that Armada.

You won't fail!
Knock 'em flat!
Then we'll drink ale
And stuff like that.

As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth
dubbed her 2 Dame, made her Poet Laureate, and gave her
the Wostern Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the
extent of Dame Fashion's service to Queen and ‘country. In
1580 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life-
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting
and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)

But I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously
enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who commanded the
English fleet against the Spanish Armada. The eweater is only
one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also
invented the glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible).

But I digress. The cardigan, I say, will be back, which is, I
believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Because the cardigan has
nice big pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes —
and that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all of
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s fine, comfortable,
mellow flavor and Marlboro’s filter. 8o why don’t you slip into
your enrdigun and hie yourself to your tobacconist for some
good Mar!boros? They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi-
gans come in pink for girls and biuo for boys. © 1902 Max Siuiane

Cardigans or pullovere—it’s a matter of taste... And eo is
Marlboro a matter of taste—the best taste that can possibly
te achieved by experienced growers and blendera—by sci-
ence, diligence, and tender loving care. Try a pack.
