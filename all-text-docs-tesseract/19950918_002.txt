The SGA held its first town
“meeting on Thursday evening in
the Chambers Gallery. The
meeting’s topic for discussion was
“Campus Beautification.”

Approximately 30 students
and administrators attended the
meeting, including the SGA’s
President Bill Gullan, Vice Presi-
dent Warren Buford, and Chancel-
lor Dennis Seavers; former Dean
Rusk Program Director Ambassa-
dor Jack Perry; and Director of the
Physical Plant Bob Collins. Five
of the 30 attenders were not mem-
bers of the SGA or the ad hoc
Committee on Campus Beautifi-
cation.

The discussion was informal,
with the participants sitting in a
circle. The floor was open for
anyone to bring up an issue or area
around campus which they felt
needed to be improved.

Gullan mentioned the poor

condition of Covington Interna-
tional, the three hole golf course

behind the senior apartments, and
the fence surrounding the Com-
puter Center on Main Street.

Clair Freeman brought up a -

lack of ashtrays outside the library
and Chambers where students and
professors smoke.

Perry said the cross-country
trails need to be repaired. New
Kappa Sigma Senator Tom Gibney
suggested that riding mountain
bikes along the trails after a rain-
storm may erode and damage the
trails.

Collins attended the meeting
to hear from students what they
feel needs improvement and to
answer specific questions students
had.

Students meet with town officials. Wake up, Jack Perry!

Collins stated that coopera-
tion and collective effort are needed
to beautify the campus. “There is
no need to point fingers,” he said.
“We all have to come together to
get things done.”

Most aesthetic problems with
the campus can be easily solved,
according to Collins. These prob-
lem areas are “warts that can be
fixed.” :

Perry said that the town meet-
ing is a good forum for students to
build momentum for changes they
would like to see enacted.

“T do appreciate the beauty of
this campus. I think it could be
prettier,” he said.

“In my 10 years here, I don’t
know that campus beautification
has been a high priority. Student
interest would be a gréat pressure
on [President] John Kuykendall,
the Trustees, and other commit-
tees.”

Gullan said he chose campus

beautification as the first issue to
be addressed at the town meeting
to help the newly formed ad hoc
committee. “We wanted to give
the committee just formed a spring-
board and suggestions.”

The nature of the problems
with the campus requires a brain-
storming session such as the one
Thursday night. “All of the diffi-
culties on this campus are subtle.
Looking for things that need help
requires training. We need to have
our eyes opened.”

Although the turnout for the
town meeting was low and most
participants were members of the
SGA, Gullan said, “We are thrilled
with the quality of the discussion.”

According to Gullan, the low
turnout does not mean students are
disinterested in the concept of
townmeetings. The concern for
the SGA, Gulian said, is “finding a
time, issue, and forum where dis-
cussion will be positive.”

days ago, now are memories of
happiertimes. Students were asked
how they felt about the plummet
into 21st place.

Many students reacted in simi-
lar ways. First came shock and
disappointment, then acceptance,
and lastly, adamant rejection of the
accuracy of the report which last
year seemed so reliable.

The majority of students
quickly pointed out that the source
of their disappointment had to do
with the judgments they expect the
public and prospective students to
make about the school.

Others are confident that any-
one who knows anything about the

school will know better than to put '

much stock in the report. “You
can’t describe Davidson in statis-
tics,” Patricia Perkins said. Some
pointed to our workload to prove
that we’re just as good as we ever
were. “Everyone knows that
Davidson is still hard. Our aca-
demics aren’t slipping,” said
Marion Woodworth.

Sara Jane Spivey made no at-

Overall, Davidson students
believe that prospective students
are not drawn here by statistics.
Freshman Brooke Bagwell pointed
out that the interesting people and
great environment have not |
changed. She had no idea that we
were ranked eighth at the time of
her application.

Clair Freeman said, “I think

' that the decline is, in part; a bless-

ing in disguise, because high school
seniors who are only interested in
rankings won’t bother applying to
Davidson, resulting in our future
applicants choosing Davidson for
its qualities that cannot be mea-
sured by statistics.”

Some students think that we
will rise up the ranks once more.
Jim Smith said, “It lets Davidson
look into the problem and get back
up to the top.”

Others believe that our high
ranking last year was a fluke.

Either way, most Davidson

students don’t depend on the judg-

ment of one magazine for pride in
their school and their classmates.

not run out of bonus bucks and

have unused meals on their cards.

“T don’t think any indepen-
dent is happy about having to pay
$10,” Luskey said of the new PCC
plan. “There may be some alterna-
tive ways to go.”

Luskey added that he still has
to do more research to determine
what alternatives are actually avail-
able.

. Problems with the process

Despite a record turnout of

voters for last week’s .elections,
many felt that there were funda-
mental problems with the election
process.

Complaints from the new
senators center around a lack of
publicity both before and during
election day.

Many of them feel that not
enough attention was given to the
candidates’ ‘speeches. —

~ Senators also thought that the
freshmen were not well informed
of when and where they could vote.

Are the problems real?

SGA President Bill Gullan felt
that the publicity was adequate.
He and Vice President Warren
Buford made hall visits; Election

Committee Chair Saad Gul and
Chancellor Dennis Seavers posted
flyers around campus; and an ad
was placed in The Davidsonian.
An estimated 100 more stu-
dents turned out to vote this year

‘than last.

In an attempt to remedy elec-
tion day problems, the SGA’ selec-
tions council has been trying to
analyze and update existing laws
as well as enforce those rules and
regulations which seem to work.

Gullan says, “There are often
unforeseen glitches during each
election.

“What we’ re concerned about
are structural problems that may or
may not exist.”
