INFIRMARY _AILING?
Gap In Information

At Fault -- Passmore

The SGA Senate heard a re-
port from junior John Pass-
more on the infirmary prob
lem, adop:ed two more ar-
ticles of the proposed stu.
dent by.laws and handled
various routine matters of the
SGA in a relatively. quiet
session Tuesday night.

Passmore reported to the
Senate that the infirmary
system is not so inadequate
as portrayed in Rich Cow.
art’s report to Senate last
week. Cowart’s report dealt
with an incident which oc-
curred in a freshman dorm
in which students were un-
able to secure medical aid
for an injured student.

Passmore noted that the

infirmary does have a night
phone number and that
emergency ambulance serv-
ice is available to the college
from Cornelius.

“The basic problem is one
of lack of information,” said
Passmore. ‘‘Emergency serv
ice is available to students
but the information is not
commonly known by the stu-
dents.”"

Passmore added that he
was working with college of-
ficials to have the needed
phone numbers placed inside
all campus phone booths for
reference in an emergency.

In other business the Sen
ate adopted two atticles of
the bylaws and tabled a

By NORWOOD POLAND

Results from a survey of
all fraternity treasurers this

Treasurers were asked to
release statistics on salaries
and hours for cooks. student
waiters, and house boys to
supplement and substantiate
data previously obtained.

pursued a stringent inspec-
tion policy, due mainly «to
the lack of alternative hous-
ing: for those living in sub-
standard houses.

The town official noted

-that the process of condemn-

ing only when’ the occupant
dies or moves may be slow,
but said that it was the only

reasonab:e policy, available.

The. housing project now
under way is sponsored by
the. Mayo: s Community Re-
lations Committee, and al-
though all of .the 21. hopses
which. are. now practically
complete will be occupied by
Nezroes,. the. development is
open to all.

According to Burt Narra.

more of Bridgeport Fabrics,
who is chairman of the de
velopment, the project will
ultirhately involve‘ some 72
lots. .
The first stage. however.
will be limited to 34. he said.
because new. financing wil
be reouired for the rest.

Applications are. still being
processed for the 34, and

is an estimate.

Feur treasurers were un-
able to give figures on hours,
while only one refused to re.
lease salary information.

Figures. from the eight fra-
ternities submitting complete
data showed house cooks re-
ceiving an average of $1.32
an hour. slightly above the
College Union cafeteria min-
imum of $1.25 for all work-
ers. However, this favorable
average masks a_ variation
from $1.00 to $1.65 an hour
for cooks in different houses.

Hourly rates for fraternity
student employes show an
even wider variation than
that of the cooks. Some stu.
dent waiters earn the equiv-
alent of $2.30 per hour, while
others are paid as littie as
$0.80.

‘However, the average wage
for student workers in the
houses is $1.40, which is gen-
erally above the cooks
wages. By comparison, all
student employes in the Un-
ion cafeteria receive $1.40 an
heur.

+ Estimates ot the number
of hours worked may not be
exact, for several treasurers
said that it-is bard to {fell
when the cooks are. really
working or when thev just
relax between meals. Esti-
mates of student waiters’
hours are ‘subject tb. the
same error factors.

Of course, the abov fig-.

ures do not tell the whole
story. Most house cooks are
paid for all vacation periods
during the school year, and
receive bonuses for big week-
ends. At least one house
pays the entire 44 per cent
Social Security tax for their
employees.

Several of the treasurers
contacted criticized the sur-
vey’s lack of questions con-
cerning employment trends
over the past féw years.

Ken Gallup. Sigma Phi Ep-
silon treaurer. said. ‘The in-
formation. requested is neith-
er complete nor does it re-
flect any attempts by the fra-
ternities to better pay and
working conditions.

“For example, our cooks’
salaries havecbeen increased
18 per cent in the last two
years, while tire number of
hours has teen reduced.’

Bill Sossaman. Pi Kappa

Alpha treasurer. reiterated
Gallup's point, adding that
cooks at his house dre now
paid 25 per cent more than
they were four years ago.
Norm Hurwitz of Sigma Chi
said that cooks there would
get about a 22 per cent raise
next September.
' Two other treasurers said
they plan to raise their
cooks salaries in: the neigh
borhood of 10 per cent in the
next few months.

“If you've got to sin, enjoy
it! There's nothing worse
‘than a= sniveling sinner,”
said Mrs. Gertrude Behanna,
guest speaker in chapel Tues-
day..

Mrs. Behanna. who was
previously an alcoholic, told
the story of her life and how
she was converted to. Chris-
itanity. —

Mrs. Behanna said that the
United States is not a Chris-
tian country as it claims to
be. She criticized the hypoc-
risy of printing “In God we
trust’’ on money when mon-
ey is what we really trust.

Although she spoke out on
current issues in American
life, she was mainly con-
cerned with Christian atti-
tudes of service to humanity
and concern for the welfare
of one’s fellow ‘man.

“Sister to every human on
earth, black, brown, red,
yellow, white—t he works.”
she said. ‘‘No matter how
degraded or poor or socially.
obscure an individual may
be. he deserves our aid and
concern.”

Her religious experience
changed her entire way of
life. In her own words: ‘‘It
was as though we were Sia-
mese twins, one of whom
must die so the other might
live.””

She emphasized that a de-
sire to benefit the world was.

Dobbs:
Radio
In Fall

By DAVID COOK
Staff Writer

Ed Dobbs. chairman of the
student committee for a
school radio station, said
yesterday that plans were
well underway for the estab-
lishment of a Davidson radio
station to be in operation by
next September.

Dobbs added that plans
were still under investigation
by a student faculty commit-
tee. but if approved, ‘would
allow for the establishment
of a carrier-current system
serving the main campus”
similar to the one at Wake
Forest.

“With favorable student
support,” he explained ‘this
system could be expanded
under the Federal Communi-
cations Commission into an
FM frequency. This would
allow a broadcasting range
to include the Davidson and
outlying communities."

Headquarters for the sta-
tion would be located in the
sound booth of Love Audi.
torjum.

Explaining that the college
already had most of the
equipment necessary to be-
gin broadcasting. Dobbs said
many technical questions still
remained to be considered.
Dobbs explained that the
purpose of a radio station
would be to respond to stu-
dent educational needs by
providing an outlet for stu-
dent apathy in return for a
program centering around
student needs.

Polled Students Support
Boycott And Wet Campus

By ED HAY
Staff Writer

Strong student support of
the boycott of Johnson's bar-
bershop and an almost unan-
imous desire for drinking on
campus was exhibited in a
student poll taken by senior
Kirk Reed recently.

The poll included 100 stu-
dents, 50 of which were fresh-
men, and 50 of which were
seniors. The students were
sefected at random, using a
random numbers. table.

The probability that it is
an accurate reflection of stu-

dent opinion is very high.”
Reed said. ‘‘The results
should be as concise as a
poll of this size permits.”

Twenty-two per cent of the
students polled said they had
picketed the barbershop. 17
per cent of these were fresh-
man and 28 per cent weré
seniors.

The question “I was in
sympathy with what the pick-
eters were doing.’’ resulted
in 73 per cent answered yes,
while 2 per cent had no opin-
ion.

The poll shows an almost

unanimous support of a new
drinking rule (97 per cent),
said Reed. “The results on
those who favor the boycott.
were much higher than ex-
pected.”

Campus.wide drinking on

appropriate occasions drew
the support of 45 per cent of
the students, with 32 per cent
of the. freshmen and 58 per
cent of the seniors.
, Only 3 per cent favored no
drinking at all on campus.
