Rush Returns

It is extremely difficult to tabulate

the total returns of this year’s frater-
nity rush at this time, for the normal
discontent over pledge programs has
not yet had ample time to arise, but
the overall picture of this year’s pro-
gram is a favorable one.

In the final analysis of rush itself,

it appears that there was an effort
on the part of fraternities to make
their system work to the benefit of
the freshmen.
’ However, that analysis also reveals
a small number of individuals who
remain excluded from the system.
And in that sense, very little has
changed.

Now is the time for action to be
taken.

While freshmen are still concerned
about their classmates and indepen-
dents and fraternity men are still open

to change, this is the. time ‘to initiate
the need awaited response to the cry
for a change in the system.

Waiting to, “let things cool off a
bit” is not a workable approach.

It is time for the fraternities-to re-
open discussion on bidding proced-
ures and the system’s nature in gen-
eral.

It is time for the intertratemnity
Council to initiate a joint program
of social reform with the indepen-
dents.

It is time to maintain what seems
to be the current level of interest in
finding’ a better program.

It is not time to forget the openness
to change which made initial appear-
ances during rush week.

If there is a better system, now is
the time to find it.

Student Counsel

Dr. Meredith Hall will be an impor
tant new addition to our community.

Davidson has long needed a pro-
fessionally trained psychological coun-
selor who can devote his time to deal-
ing directly with the emotional needs
of the students and the faculty on
campus. Many other schools have al-
ready hired professional counselors,
and it is good to see that Davidson is
finally bi g Dr. Hall here.

Dr. Hall is the right man for the
job. He is a warm person, he is a
competent professional, and he is a
valuable resource person. Hopefully,
he will give valuable assistance to
faculty advisors and hall counselors.
He will also be available to students
on a personal, confidential basis.

It is quite unfortunate, however,
that Dr. Hall is being hired on such
a limited basis — only a few -hours
per week. We can certainly use such
talents here more than this. But even
this much time is a good start.

Meeting the personal and emotional
needs of our community is just as
important as meeting academic Regs.
Moreover, it seems that academic\p
gress cannot be made in a m ng-

1 way without personal progress.

The acquisition.of the valuable tal-
ents of Dr. Hall is a progressive step
in the development the school, and
those responsible for bringing’ this
man here are to be commended for
their insight and thanked for their
concern.

Lots And Lots

We would like to invite the college
administration to join us on a tour
of Davidson’s improvised parking lots
at the earliest possible time.

The new lots have been in use since
early fall, but they are becoming
more and more visible now that the
snow is melting and the tire tracks
are showing up.

For the college to insist that there
is still no major parking ‘problem is
ridiculous.

That tour of which we spoke would
easily reveal the seriousness of the
shortage of available parking space.

The students in search of parking
have literally torn up the grassy areas
near Richardson Dorm; they have
packed into ‘No Parking” areas; they
have lined the roads.

It looks like a busy community col
lege, jammed with commuting stu-
dents’ cars.

And there is no real reason why
it should.

Late Bowl Thoughts

Someone in Orlando asked us after
the Toledo game if we had lost our
taste for tangerines.

The joke wasn’t particularly fun-
ny; the answer was simple. No.

No one was embarrassed by the.

game (which, if you don’t read sports
pages, Toledo won 56-33), unless it
be the Toledo supporters who pre-
dicted a shut-out.

Slade was fantastic, and the Toledo
players were the first to admit it.

The final three-touchdown victory
was one touchdown less than odds-
makers had predicted, but what no
one had counted on was the come
back. ability of Coach Homer Smith’s

STP

charges.

The passing was brilliant. The run-
ning was very admirable.

The only thing lacking was a break
or two, and perhaps some momentum
in the first half. }

Unfortunately, and perhaps ironi-
cally, Davidson’s passing power turn-
ed on just as television power went
out, and those who avoided the Flori-
da trip for the comfort of home miss-

. ed one of the best efforts of ‘the sea-

son.

A vote of confidence and thanks
to the members of the 1969 Wildcats
for their positive contribution to the
Davidson experience.

‘New Left! Disapproves

Encounter Groups: Hope Or Hell?

Sensitivity training as an
aid or detriment to the in-
dividual, his education and
occupational environment
was evaluated recently by
speakers on the, University
of Santa Clara campus.

The conference, ‘‘En-
counter Groups: Hape or
_Hell,’’ was sponsored by the
* Center’ for thée> Study of
Contemporary Values. un-
der the direction -of Dr.
Stuart McLean, assistant

professor “of theology’ '#t*

Santa Clara.

Conference keynote speak-
er, Dr. William Schultz of
the Esalen. Institute in Big
Sur, defined _ sensitivity
training as a “tool in so

’ cial revolution of openness

and honesty. The result will
be a new way of relating to
self and others.”

He traced the patterns of
repressive behavior  incul-
cated in the individual dur-
ing childhood and the me-
thods the encounter group
employs to counteract this
conditioning. In enumerat-
ing the guidelines used in
the sensitivity ‘‘session”’ he
said, ‘‘participants are to be
open, honest, talk about the

‘now and express when pos-'*"’”

sible physitally what doula

have been expressed ver-

bally."’

‘Chairman of the Santa
Clara Psychology depart-
ment, Dr. Roland Lowe, re-
sponded to Schultz with the

deficiencies inherent in the
encounter group method. He
questioned the qualifications
of group leaders and
asked for evidence ‘'to
prove that sensitivity train-
ing does what it claims."

He also challenged the
value of total honesty in re-
lation to the i:nportance’ of
an individual's privacy and
added ‘‘coping with alone-
ness ls a valuable part of

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Students Hit Independent Rush

To the Editor:

Before I get started into
the text of my statement, let
me give some background
information. I am an Inde-
pendent, by choice (I did
not participate in rush), and
have spent maybe a total of
15 minutes inside fraternities
in my whole college career.

Therefore, I have no spe-
cial interests, and no axe to
grind..This is my lend some-
what, more weight to my
statements.

Personally, I disapprove of
the fraternity system strong-
ly. But such an obscenity as
the so-called ‘A Freshman's
Guide to Rush’ cannot be
ignored by anyone, whether
fraternity or Independent.

The\statistics are fine, as if
the excellent speech by Joe
Murphy. I find nothing ob-
jectionable in either of these.

Where the obscenity comes
in is the section entitled
“A View of the Twelve.’ I
have rarely seen such a
biased, misstatement of in-
formation.

Take, for instance, the
analysis of Sigma Nu—and
I quote ‘*. . . this chapter of
Sigma Nu has been involved
in two of the most serious
incidents of hazing—putting
one pledge in the hospital
and leaving another on the
floor of his room in convul-
sions, We will be glad to
fill you “inéon the gory de-
‘tails—they are available.”

Right!! Go check the gory
details—from a Sigma Nu.
Surprise!! They aren't so
gory after all. Isn't that
amazing?

Could my fellow  sancti-
monious,  Holier-than-Thou,
self-righteous, egotistical In-
dependents be wrong? Could
they have exaggerated some-
what? Yep, they sure could
have. And did.

I have been told by others
that there are yet more mis-
statements of fact in’ the
booklet. I am sure there are.
How about that, Hobbie and
Company? Any comments?

And then, there is the si¢k-
ening attitude pervading this
volume ‘of the innate and
God-given superiority of the
Independents in alk things.
The volume~ is almost— con-
descending—almost, nothing
—it is condescending!

Since this is a family news-
paper, I will quote the Gov-
ernor of Ga. (not, incident-
ally, that this is an endorse-
ment of his politics)
Phooey!"

That is a lot of bunk. The
difference is largely one of
attitude the self-righteous-
ness of the writers of this
séction has no justification
in fact. Only in their minds.

I do not endorse the fra-
ternity system, but I realize
that it does “perform a so-
eial function on this campus
of great value, in spite of
its many defects.

What I am aiming for there
ds tolerance on the part of
the Independents. Slander

a confrontation with politi-
cal issues was described
by Ransom as the Left's
basic objection to sensiti-
vity sessions,

He found them a middle
class phenomenon and the
openness policy described
as fallacy-ridden. .‘‘Equals
can be honest — — unequals
cannot,"’ He stated the obli-
gation of society to support
the development of the indi-
vidual ‘‘which it does not
do'' and called it ‘a cruel
hoax to say we can este

been time,; tor expose the
fallacies perpetiated by the
Independent$, as Mr. Hobbie
has exposed,.those of the
other fraterpities in his well-
concieved ‘but © overdrawn
handbook.. ~

I must first commend the
Indies for a good rush, one

actually exceeding that of the
other fraternities in the vol-
ume of literature distribut-
ed and especially in the
amount of mud-slinging.

Yes, theirs was a first-
class rush, complete with a
Friday afternoon rush party,
a Monday night pledge par-
ty, and an adequate reper-
toire of rush slogans: ‘‘Fra-
ternities are bad; they hurt
people.’ “Stick with us;
we'll change the system.”’

As to changing the system,
the breeze coming from the
Independent quarter has done
little toward this end. I
agree with THE DAVIDSON-
IAN editorial of January 9:
change “must begin on an
individual level.

The strength of the fra-
ternity system is evidence
that it serves a valuable
function for those who need
a fraternity for  self-fulfill-
ment.

If the system’s bad really
outweighs its good, then just
give it enough rope and it
will hang itself.

And as to hurting people
by exclusiveness, who are
the Indies that they should
cast the first stone?

I can cite several examples
of people who have. been
deluded into thinking that
exclusion by fraternities
meant automatic acceptance
into the sjoble ranks of In-
dependent)

Yet when they try to break
into the closely-knit clique
of Indies, they are told sub-
tly but unambiguously that
they don't make it. They
might as well have been
formally blackballed.

The name ‘‘Independents’’
is misleading, since the only
thing they are’ independent
of is a national office.

The role of the Davidson
Indies is tragically analo-
gous to that of the pigs in
Orwell's ‘Animal: Farm:"
“The creatures outside look-
ed from pig to man, and
from man to pig, and from
pig to man again; but al-
ready it was impossible to
say which was which.”

Alumnus Offers Social Alternative:
New Aeademiec Schedule Criticized

To the Editor:

I read with interest and
enthusiasm the five Spen-
cer Commission reports
and was especially pleased
with the recommendations
concerning coeducation, ex-
tra campus responsibilities
and social patterns.

The report on Social Pat
terns is of special interest
to me since for the past
two years I have been em-
ployed as a Residence Hall
Director at Fresno State
College in California while
working on a master’s de-
gree in counseling.

mental in clarifying the in-
dividual's image of his po
litical self. ‘It avoids the
projection of personal pro-
blems_on the political level
amd action for the sake of
enhancing a liberal image,”

- Schultz said.

The chairman of the Advi-
sory Committee on Guides
for Moral Instruction in
California schools, Dr. Ed-
win Klotz, labeled sensitivi-»
ty training ‘‘old-fashioned
nihilism, a breakdown én the

individual's “value~ system” -

and antithetical, to. indivi-
dualism in its creation of de-
pendency on a group. “It is
a source of rebelidbn destin-
ed to be controlled by the
community.”

Dr. Joseph Powers, pro-
fessor of theology at the
Graduate Theological Un-
ion in Berkley, offered the
following theological-ethical
evaluation of sensitivity
training: Religious and en-
counter purposes basically
cornpatible.

Both seek ‘‘to find free-
dom within a group and ac-
cept feelings as an assis-
tance in making free deci-
sions."” At present, ‘we
still don't know the people
we're educating and what
we're educating them for,”’

Our residence hall pro
gram is very similar to that
proposed by the commis-
sion, and since I graduated
three years ago,.I feel that

I can realistically compare -

the two social systems.

Our residence hall com-
plex houses twelve hundred
co-ed students in nine build-
ings with living units rang-
ing from suites for six stu-
dents to floors with fifty
students.

Each living unit has its
own lounge, kitchenette,
and study room in addition
to large lounges, recrea-
tion rooms, television rooms
and laundry facilities for
each building.

Student ~ government in
the halls sponsor an active
program of social, cultural,
athletic _and-—recreational
attivities.

Each living unit includes
students from’ all classes
and~new students are fan-
domly assigned in a man-
ner which provides for.a
balanced representation of
various ages, races, nation-
alities, personality types
and interest groups.

The advantages of the
fraternity system at David-
son are also available in
our own residence hall pro-
gram but without some of
the disadvantages. Both

systems-offer .an. opportun-..

ity to identify with a small
group.on the campus and
to develop close personal
relationships within this
group.

‘Both systems provide for
participation in social, cul-
tural, athletic and recrea-
tional activities and a chan-
ce for individuals to devel-
op leadership and organi-
zational bilities through
the government structure.

I have found, however,
that a more broad-minded,
tolerant attitude is devel-
oped when students are part
of a group which contains
a diverse cross-section of
individuals rather than a
group such as a fraternity
which tends \to include peo-
ple with the same general

backgrounds.

Also, in our residence
hall program, students who
are socially less advanced
than others when they first
arrive have a chance to de-
velop social confidence
without the stigma of re-
jection or exclusion,

Finally, there seems to
be less pressure to conform
to certain patterns of be-
havior and greater appre-
ciation for a variety of in-
terests, personality types,
and activities in the resi-
dence hall system.

Although fraternities are .

still playing.a necessary
role on large campuses
where people need a small
group to identify with, I
feel that a strong, active
residence hall. program is
the best system for a small
campus such as Davidson.

Although I realize the
problems inherent in chang-
ing something with as much
tradition and emotion asso:
ciated with iit as the pre-
sent. fraternity dominated
social system” at Davidson,
I hope the students, faculty,
administration,” and alumni
can unite behind the re
commendations of the Com-
mittee on Social Patterns
to “develop the best possible
system.

vy ts et:

To the Editor: br :
I.was’ amazed at the de-
cision of the college con-
cerning “next year's aca-
demic calendar. It would
seem, that a reasonable uni-
formity would be maintain-
ed from year to: year.
Such: changes from 1968-
69 and: 1969-70 procedure are
inexplicable and, in two
specific occasions, based

,on inept forethought.

First, the college's deci-

sion to begin the fall term ,

more than a week earlier
than in the previous two
years ‘has . taken; everyone
by surprise.

I personally know of stu-
dents who have already ,con-
tracted work for the sum-
mer through the projected
date for the ‘beginning of
classes,

Are these students: to suf-
fer the penalty of cuts in all
their. classes until they are
released from their jobs
just because the college
has decided..we are to start
earlier than usual?

Secondly,. the policy to be-
gin the winter term before
the Christmas break is be-
wildering.

North Carlina State Uni-
versity has found that a po-
licy of dividing terms by
the Christmas holiday so un-
satisfactory that next” year
ft will abandon the system.

And now our college offi-
cials have decided_to_recall
this old idea. As the calen-
dar is this year (and was
last year), the break divides
the fall and winter terms,
giving students an oppor-
tunity to work if necessary,
or ‘just rest.

I realize that perhaps the
college is trying to substi-
tute studying for the Latter:
but, by doing so, they re-
Strict those who need mon-
ey badly enough to do the
former.
