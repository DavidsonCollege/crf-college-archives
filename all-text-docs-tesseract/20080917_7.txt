Aging Tour de France to Take One
Last Shot at Lance Armstrong

September 9, 2008 ~ The
Tour de France, a highly regarded
international cycling competition
active from 1999-2005, is
attempting a comeback at cycling
phenomenon Lance Armstrong.

encountered significant struggles in
international recognition between
2005 and 2008, decided to give
Lance Armstrong what will surely
be its last effort at athletic event
redemption.

After careful thought and consideration, Lance accepted Le Tour’s come-
back attempt from his Plano, Texas home Thursday evening.

In a statement released early
Tuesday moming on the Tour’s
website, Publicity Chair, Pierre
Goffard stated, “Despite its
comparatively old age when viewed
alongside other cycling tours, the
Tour de France is excited for the
opportunity to thrive once again.”

Conceming the reasons for
attempting a comeback to Mr.
Armstrong, sources close to the
Tour have indicated “a bigger
cause” and “a chance to prove
itself once again.” The Tour, which

After discussing the matter
with its family members, the Giro
d'Italia (Tour of Italy) and the
Vuelta de Espana (Tour of Spain),
The Tour announced its intention to
return to Lance Armstrong with the
goal of raising awareness about the
struggling state of cycling around
the world.

“Tt felt like someone had been
letting the air out of our ‘event-
producing tires.” After being forced
to ride on the rims and partly destroy
our previously solid foundation, we
said enough was enough.”

Even though the Tour never
tested positive for the use of
illegal marketing ploys to attract
a wider audience, the attention
these scandals caused plagued
its’ success in recent years. New
marketing management indicated
the possibility of a fundraiser
involving the sale of trendy yellow
wristbands for the cause.

“To be honest,” Monsieur
Goffard said, “it doesn’t even matter
if people are wearing the bands to
support us or because they’re the
most fashionable thing out there.
As long as money is coming in, we
aren’t asking any questions.”

Whether or not this is
successful, all members of the
Publicity Committee agree that
the Tour’s 2009 attempt at Lance
Armstrong will surely need to be a
strong one.
