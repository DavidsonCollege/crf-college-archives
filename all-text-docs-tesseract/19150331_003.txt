TO DAVIDSON CUVIZENS.

_ ‘Phe town of Davidson has betore ita
future equal in eve rv “respect to it's past,

In order thatthe best results may be
obtained, that our influence may become
as widespread as it should be, that we
may all have the full benefit of the de
velopment of our municipal affairs, what
resources we have and our trade. it. is
essential that our Jaws be framed to
make that result possible.

Ours, Lhave-heen told, isa government
of the people and whatever laws we mav
operate under are the direct: results of].
the deliberations of the representatives
of the people.

It those laws are obstructive, as thev
must be at times, it is the duty of our
business men to call attention of — the
Board of Aldermen to the fact and urge
as well as they may, good reasons for
corrections. It is the duty af all paad
citizens to take an interest in their gov-
ernment.

We have been prone to give but little
consideration to the fitness of candidates
for the office of law makers, and tf, as
occasionally happens (but in this case t
do not know when) unworthy repre-
sentatives have heen returned, it is not
the fault of the representative, it is: not
the fault of the system, but it is due en-
tirely to our own negligence and it little
behooves us to find fault with’ the result
of our own negligence. carelessness, and
lack of performance of duty.

Our form of government is just as re-
sponsive to the will of the people as anv
other of it’s size and kind that [ know of.

There is no question but that it is the
desire of those in power to do the hest
thev can to promote the welfare of the
town, and it were idle to say that wun-
iust discrimination will be made in the
face of sound opposition.

Therefore it is incumbent upon our
business men to devote some attention |.
and time to political affairs.

We must bear in mind that no serious
iniustice can be done to any branch of
industry without having it’s effect upon
the whole business structure. All indus-
trv is akin. Tniustice"*to one branch
affects all. And no great constructive
work for the gnod of the State. muni-
cipality or peenle was ever founded up-
on injustice, But what may appear to
be iniustice is oftentimes superficial
action based upon lack of experience or

much t more peneral and. more intellect

at the present.

The tinte ts here for intensive culti
vation im social and political fields as it
isin agriculture and preventive mediciac,
and this can only be effected by harmon
ious and intelligent’ co-operation amone
the business men, wage earners, and in
fact, all participants in our, present so
cial and industrial onder, [sit toa much
to visk that we have this in a constantly
increasing, measure ?

In conclusion, allow me to put in oa
plea for our children as they are the
comme generation of men and women.
They need an education. Ours is a
munipical graded schaol, Lets pay our
taxes. for they are due and the School
Board needs it’s part of the money to
meet the teachers’ salarias.

A CITIZEN.

MRS,

It was with sincere regret that. the
students af Davidson heard of the death
of Mrs. Jackson, the wife of Gen.
“Stonewall” Jackson,

Mrs. Jackson was closely associated
with Davidson in that) she owas — the
daughter of Dr. Morrison, the first
President of this college. A large part
of her girlhood days was spent in Dav
idson, in the house occupied by Dr. Mar
tin. The last part of her life she spent
in Charlotte, and she often came up. to
Fwisit the ald college and the scenes of
ther childhood. Many of the’ students,

by repute. had come to consider her a
personal friend.
Dr. Martin attended the — funeral

services held in Charlotte Thursday aft-
ernoon. A few old hymns, her favorites,
were sung and prayers were offered.
Then a long. sorrowful procession fol-
lowed the casket, covered with flowers,
ta the depot, and watched the train de-
nart that carried her body to join that of
her husband. She was laid) away in
Lexington on the following dav.

All Davidson students would extend

to the bereaved ones their heartfelt
sympathy.
L. H. Wilkinson ('13) was on the

Hill for a short time last week.
