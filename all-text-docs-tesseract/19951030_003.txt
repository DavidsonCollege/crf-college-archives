Frederick Douglass Centennial

Speaker champions Douglass
as great journalist, a great man

By Wit BrapsHaw

In a time when the press was
the only window on the world
people had available to them,
Frederick Douglass used journal-
ism to advance the cause of the
abolition of slavery and, later, mi-
nority liberation.

This is the theory of Dr. Waldo
Martin, Professor of History at the
University of California-Berkeley
who lectured on the life of
Frederick Douglass Thursday in
’ the Chambers Lobby. _

During Martin’s talk, which
lasted just overan hour, he stressed
the importance of Douglass’ jour-
nalistic career, giving special em-
phasis to the societal framework of
his readership and ‘the fact that
papers Doulgass published were a
distinctly and recognizably Afri-
can-American voice.,

“The person that bought the
paper would not be the only person
to read it,” Martin said. “It would
be recycled and read at the dinner
table, in bars, on the street, so that

Born a slave in the American
South during the early 1800s,
Frederick Douglass never knew
his birth date or his father’s iden-
tity. He seldom saw his mother, a
slave ona plantation over 12 miles
away.

Familiar with slavery’s physi-
cal brutality and dehumanization,
Douglass became determined at a
young age to gain his freedom and
a sense of individual identity.

In memory of a man who de-
voted his life to the fight for the
abolition of slavery, Davidson cel-
ebrated the Frederick Douglass
Centennial last week.

one paper might be read or seen by
50 or 100 people.”

He continued to say that the
papers Douglass published had two
main goals: “first, the elevation
and uplift of free blacks, and sec-

ondly, to get rid of slavery and end-

discrimination.”

Martin noted the extra power
Douglas gained within his reader-
ship, which was mostly limited to
Northerners with abolitionist ten-
dencies.

But Douglass did not begin
the black press tradition.
Freedom’s journal was the first
black journal to speak out against
slavery; it began publishing in
1827.

Douglass edited four papers
in his lifetime, The North Star
(1847-51), Frederick Douglass’
Paper (1851-59), Douglass’
Monthly (1859-63), The New Na-
tional Era (1870-73).

Martin noticed the egotistical
turn that the names of some of his
papers took, saying it was also
expressed in the three autobiogra-
phies he wrote. “Anybody who

It was while working for this
couple that Douglass began to learn

change the course of his life.

Douglass’ lessons ended soon
after they began, but the desire to
learn had been planted in him.

him, he eventually mastered read-

one to teach slaves to read or write,

Martin highlighted Douglass’
oratorical ability and his persua-
sive powers, saying he was an ex-
cellent speaker and so good at ar-
guing that even when he would
change his mind on issues through-
out his life, he could still make
extremely powerful cases for both
sides.

But ability to speak and argue
is not what Martin found most per-
tinent about Douglass, and it is not
why he is remembered today.
Martin underscored his importance
as aman who fought for the dignity
and freedom of all people.

“He grappled with issues we
are still. grappling mightily with
today: the issue of race, and its
meaning and consequences, and
what it means to be an American,”
Martin said about Douglass.

“He rejected the U.S. asa white

tion. He envisioned an inclusive

though he escaped to the North at
the age of 20, Douglass continued
his work to free America’s slaves.

Soon after his escape, he was
introduced to William Lloyd Gar-
rison, publisher of the Liberator,
the North’s radical abolitionist
newspaper.

Garrison invited Douglass to
become an orator for the abolition-
ist cause.

Soeloquentthat some doubted
that he had ever been a slave at all,
Douglass became a symbol tomany
of America’s possible future free-
dom.

When the Civil War broke out,
Douglass welcomed it as a war of
necessity, having become con-
vinced that moral persuasion was

idea at the next meeting the
Patterson Court service chairs had
with Community Service Coordi-
nator Catherine Turner. They were
excited to find that the other ser-
vice chairs were very receptive to
the idea.

Jill Stephenson, aservice chair
from Rusk, already had plans for a
haunted house in the back of her
mind. During the eating house
skits for freshmen last month, she

walked down to the basement of
Johnson Gym and said she thought
it was a pretty scary place.

The service chairs decided that
they would get donations from their
houses, set up a free Halloween
carnival and haunted house for the
children of faculty and from the
town. Keeping in line with the
service idea, they also decided to
accept donations at the event for
Project Life.

The service chairs then re-
served the gym, ordered the tables,
and spent several hours on Tues-
day setting up the event. Members

Frederick Douglass, 1817-1895.

Frederick Douglass

very. ‘
Av the war's; end, the 13th
Amendment officially abolished
slavery in America.

However, Douglass was
pained to see that although
America’s four million slaves had
been freed, they were still not
granted full rights of citizenship in
law or in practice.

Legislated freedom did little
to protect African-Americans from
the oppression of the Black Codes
and Jim Crow laws or the intimida-
tion and violence of the Ku Klux
Klan.

Douglass’ believed that the
solution to this situation lay in the
vote. Consequently, he led the

struggle for suffrage until the 15th
Amendment was passed in 1870.

- Never abandoning his «cause,

Douglass fought for equal rights
and treatment of blacks through-
out his. life.

Born a slave, he went on to
publish three autobiographies, es-
tablish his own newspapers, one of
which was The North Star, and
serve as the United States Minister
to the Republic of Haiti.

Last week, a century after his
death, Douglass was remembered
both for his acheivements and for
his message that the people of
America must “give up the idea
that to degrade the colored man is
to elevate the white man.”
