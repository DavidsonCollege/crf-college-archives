Racketeers Serve To Tough Enemies

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

“I really find no fault in the
play of our guys,’’ commented
Davidson tennis coach Jeff
Frank.

The statement is a tribute to
the play of the Cat netters,
considering they had just
dropped two of their last three
matches, including a 9-0
shellacking at the hands of
UNC.

Several factors should be
considered when evaluating
the quality of tennis the Cats
have been playing.

First, Carolina has a
nationally ranked team, which
is considered by many to be
one of the best, if not the top
team, in the region. The team
could have called down to
Chapel Hill the morning of the
match and called off the af-
ternoon fiasco because of the
weather.

‘“‘The boys really wanted to
play the match though,” ex-
plained Frank. ‘‘They really
showed some effort out
there.”’

The loss matched the score
by which the Tar Heels
mauled the Cats last spring on
the Hill. But the Cats played
some ‘‘tough tennis,’’ ac-
cording to Frank.

John Mitchell was the only
Davidson netter who came
close to winning his match as
he took the first set, 6-2; drop-
ped the second one, 3-6; and
drove the third set to a tie
breaker, after having been
down 5-2 early in the set.

His opponent, David Ober-
stein, is a top competitor who
is nationally ranked.

Frank was quick to main-
tain that the doubles play was
still a bright spot for the Cats.
In the match that they won
against Delaware, they en-

tered the doubles competition
tied at three matches apiece.
When it was all over, the Cats
had a 6-3 triumph.

“The Delaware contest was
really a great match,”’ Frank
said. ‘They did not lose
anyone off their team from
last year that we beat 6-3."

After the first four singles
matches, the Cats found them-
selves down by a tally of 3-1.
Senior Gary Bressler was the
sole victor in the upper
echelon of the team as he took

a quick two-set victory, 6-4, 7- ©

5.

Steve Holman came through
at the fifth spot and Mitchell
captured the win at number
six to pull the Cats even as
they began the doubles play.

The Davidson club started
off well in the doubles, as
Bressler teamed with Jim
Dorsett to gain a nifty win in
the second doubles slot. They
took the match in straight
sets.

Bill Allen and Rick Quinby
the two top players for the
Cats, combined to form the
first doubles team andthey lost
their initial set, 3-4. They
rallied in the next set,
however, to win 7-6 on a tie-
breaker.

Virtually the same thing
happened in the number three
doubles, where Holman was
playing with Bill DuPont.
They dropped the first set, but
bounced back to take the win
in the second one.

At this point the outcome of
the match was clearly in
doubt, desite the 4-3 lead held
by the Cats. Allen and Quinby
grabbed a quick 5-2 lead in
the final set, only to have to
hold on by winning Allen’s ser-
vice for a 6-4 win. This assured
the Cats of the team victory.

Roundballers Attempt
To Set Higher Goal

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

On Friday night the David-
son Wildcats will put their
basketball team back on the
court for one final appearance
in helping to close out the
present season.

The Cats will square off
against Wake Forest at the
Greensboro Coliseum as part
of the festivities surrounding
the 1974 National Collegiate
Athletic Association basket-
ball finals.

The contest will be one
where 11-foot baskets are
used, which is one foot higher
than the present rim positions.

The game is an annuai event
sponsored by the Executive
Committee of the NCAA, used
to determine the feasability of
vossible new rules.

The higher baskets will be
the only variation from the
present rules of NCAA basket-
ball.

What this is designed to do is
check into one possible
solution to the problem of in-
creased goal tending
violations and dunking rules,
pushed forward by the

growing heights of collegiate
front-court men.

One interesting feature that

Holland brought out is that
both Wake and Davidson have
very small squads.

‘Tam not sure that anything
will be seen regarding big men
in basketball, since neither
one of us have anybody that is
really that big,’’ Holland com-
mented.

Holland also stated that
uune of the seniors from this
year’s squad will participate
in the contest. Deacon Coach
Carl Tacy will use the same
strategy.

One thing that will be in-
teresting to note will be the
resulting shooting per-
centages in the game. In an
earlier meeting this season,
the Cats and Deacons both
shot around 50 percent from
the field against each other.
The Cats of course ranked
high in the nation for a long
time in field goal shooting ac-
curacy.

The game will be a prelude
of some exciting basketball
action at the Greensboro
facility. The following day will
see the long-awaited rematch
between the UCLA Bruins and
the North Carolina State Wolf-
pack. The big difference bet-
ween this game and the one in
early December is that the
Pack is rated as the number
one.team in the nation, while
UCLA is now ranked second.

to win and give the Cats an
identical win to the one last
year.

Sfeclier in the work the Cats
had taken a severe beating at

the hands of Swathmore by a
score of 8-1.But this team also
had not lost anyone from the
previous year, along with ad-
ding three new players to the
squad.

a sharp rebound from last week’s 1-3 record.

Farrell Stresses Success,
skin Fundamentals

Basic Pig

By MARK WILENSKY

Davidson College will field a
winning football team next
season. Anyone who fails to
believe that has not met Ed
Farrell.

I am not easy to impress
when it comes to football
coaches. I have been exposed
to Don Shula for too long. But
much like Shula did when he
came to Miami, Farrell is im-
pressing people with his
dedication, confidence and
style.

Farrell and I discussed the
total scope of the Wildcat foot-
ball program; a program he
feels can begin to succeed im-
mediately. Over the last three
years, Ferrell coached
Bridgeport teams to a 30-3
record.

“T have the utmost respect
for the football coaches who
were at Davidson prior to my
arrival,’’ Farrell said, ‘‘I
respected them before I got
here and since I’ve been to
look at game films and speak
to our players that respect has
grown.”’

Farrell cited the tremen-
dous odds Davidson teams
have faced in recent years.
Despite these odds and their
losing record, Farrell feels
that the players don’t talk or
think like losers. Even with
the losing situation, he and his

coaches feel the Wildcats have |

been well coached.

«While explaining that he
knew of no magic formulas,
Farrell said the situation here
is right for winning. The key is
the new schedule, providing a
realistic chance of winning
football games.

‘Davidson students are suc-
cess oriented, sad Farrell said.

“‘We intend to make their suc-
cess Carry over to football.”’

The new coach has a very
simple philosophy of football.

‘Football takes too much of
a student’s time and is too big
an investment for the school to
be worth much if done un-
successfully. We will win and
we will succeed,” he ex-
plained.

I asked the difference bet-
ween this philosophy and the
winning is the only thing”
philosophy of some coaches.
Using a Dave Fagg line,

Farrell pointed out that the at-
tempt at winning was the im-
portant thing.

“While this may be the
same thing Coach Fagg said,
the difference is that now we
have a realistic chance to win.

“Our schedule is not the
easy one some think it is, but
while Hampton-Sidney fields a
very tough team, I have to
think we’re better off playing
them than Air Force,” Farrell
added.
