Crimestopppers Program Introduced At Davidson

By Tom Price

Crimestoppers, a nation-wide
organization that allows citizens to
report crimes anonymously and
receive rewards for their efforts,
has reached Davidson. The North
Mecklenburg Crimestoppers in-
cludes the communities of
Davidson College, the town of
Davidson, Cornelius, and Hun-
tersville.

In the past, Davidson and the
other towns were included in the
Mecklenburg County Crimestop-
pers. The rapid population growth
of the northern part of the county
convinced Davidson, Cornelius,
and Huntersville that a separate
organization was needed.

Officer D.E. McLaurin is the
contact person for the Campus

that Crimestoppers works and
wants Davidson students to be-
come more involved.

“We know it works,” he ex-
plained, “Cornelius has already
cleared 3 or 4 cases.” The system
only works, however, if people are
willing to call in and report what
they have seen or heard.

As an incentive to calling in,
rewards are offered for informa-
tion leading to an arrest. Cri-
mestoppers pays up to $1000,
depending on the case. The North
Mecklenburg Crimestoppers meet
once a month to determine the size
of awards and to discuss other
business.

The whole process is totally

confidential. When citizens callin’

they are not asked to reveal their
name. Instead, they are assigned a

number. If the caller receives a
reward, he or she may obtain the
money in any fashion they wish so
as to maintain confidentiality.
Officer McClaurin explained
that if a student was to receive a
reward for his cooperation and
wanted to maintain his anonymity,

Crimestoppers would even “be
willing to ride by his dorm and
throw the money out the window.”

Crimestoppers works for any

kind of crime. From minor theftto —

drug dealing to murder, the system
is designed to help police solve all
types of cases. The main point,

though, is that Crimestoppers
doesn’t work at all unless citizens
pick up the phone.

bicycles being stolen, this year has also seen
the continued inane prank of pulling fire
alarms.

On Saturday, September 14 a student
from UNC and a student from Duke were
charged with molesting the fire alarm system.
These two people are awaiting trial. for this
misdemeanor. Eventhough these two people
were outsiders, Davidson students are often
the ones whoare guilty of pulling fire alarms.

The warning is as follows:
