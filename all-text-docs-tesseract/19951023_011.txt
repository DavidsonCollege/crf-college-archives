Uncover the Gelatins 1 in Our Closet

By Mary STEPHENS
Staff Writer

No, this is not a collection of
little-known Betty Crocker Jell-o
molds nor is ita display of Grateful
Dead paraphernalia (rest in peace
Jerry), but it is the latest exhibition
in the Edward M. Smith Gallery at
the Visual Arts Center. Subtitled
“Photographs from the Permanent
Collection,” Gelatins in the Closet
brings together photographs de-
veloped using, primarily, the gela-
tin process.

Gelatin prints were first done
during the late 19th century and
were made. from an emulsion of
gelatin soaked in water, calcium
bromide, and silver nitrate.

The photographs in this col-
lection are: mostly from the mid to
late 1900s, but the gelatin silver
print gives them an older almost
antiquarian look.

Although all of the photo-
graphs are taken by different art-
ists, they each have a similar em-
phasis on gesture. Even before one
sets foot in the gallery itself the
oversized Johnny Weissmuller (a
bust of a young man) by George
Hurrell prepares the viewer for the
montage of bodies and gestures to
follow.

Images of bodies alone or

coupled with other images or ob-
jects run throughout the collec-
tion. The sense that gesture or
poise can evoke a particular emo-
tion seems to link each of the pho-
tos.

Few of the shots represent
bodies in their entirety, but give
the viewer a glimpse of a face
behind a veil, a profile obscured,
or a torso without the extended
legs or head.

Some of the most moving pho-
tographs in the collection involve
images where the artist has delib-
erately distorted the view by ma-
nipulation of the angle.

In two of these, The Unfortu-

‘nate Man Could Not Touch the

One He Loved by Duane Michals
and Nude ona Beachby Bill Brandt
blur almost indecipherably the
camera’s angle. This shift in per-
spective coupled with the antiqued,
gelatin process create a striking
effect. Only three of the 20 photo-
graphs in the exhibit use color film
and only one of the pictures con-
tains no human figures.

Don’t miss this exhibition.’

These photographs stay with you,
especially Les Beants du Nord by
Doisneau and Parking Lot,
Volendam, Holland by Louis
Stettner, but they won’t stay up
forever. Go soon.

I risk my reputation in dis-
cussing Brown Mountain Lights,
but since it bears particular signifi-
cance in this season of spooks and
spirits, Iam going to tell you an
unexaggerated story abaut those
mysterious lights up in the hills.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN

Working in Banner Elk, N.C.
one summer, I heard many folk
tales, as one often does when im-
mersed in camp culture for three
months. I was not surprised, nor
did I give it much thought, when

stories about the mysterious
Brown Mountain Lights crept
in around the campfire. The
Brown Mountain Lights re-
mained a figment of some other
counselor’s imagination until
that night I ascended to
Wiseman’s View.

Located about 15 miles
northwest of Morganton, Brown
Mountain seems like any other
mountain in the horizon, during
the day. There is nothing man-
made on the mountain — no
buildings, towers, nor paved
roads, Trees upon more trees
encompass the whole of its ter-

Bright fi site.

and you will swear it is a differ-
ent mountain.

dirt road through the Pisgah Forest, I
had little idea what to-expect. We
hiked the short distance to the over-
look, and I was not very surprised.
We stood on the opposite slope of the
Linville Gorge looking out on a sky-
line which could be any major city at
night. Headlights moved on the blan-
keted highways, radio towers blinked

_ warning lights to the aircraft arriving

and departing, and the lighted outline
of buildings composed a city brim-
ming of nightlife. The lights moved,
twinkled, and flashed in their brilliant
colors of red, green, blue and white,
calling attention to the objects they
abstractly represent; and yet, there
were no cars moving, no towers sig-
naling the imaginary airplanes and no
city in which to arrive. What ap-
peared to be buildings were mere shad-
ows; what are those lights?

I was not the first person to query
into the mysterious lights of Brown
Mountain. Many years back, Na-

4 4

tional Geographic did an investiga-
tion as to the cause. The experiment
involved observers placed strategi-
cally on the mountain, with other ob-
servers maintaining radio contact
while watching the lights from sur-
rounding vantage points. Those
watching the lights would direct the
scientists on the mountain to the loca-
tion where the lights were appearing,

but no conclusions were ever drawn.:

Nothing was visible to the observers
on the mountain, and yet the whole

mountain shimmered in these
lights.

Of course, you will never
believe until you see it for your-
self. I can’t offer an explana-
tion, but I can give you direc-
tions. Take 1-40 West to N.C.
181 North. When you hit Sec-
ondary Road 183, take a left

_and you will arrive in Linville
Falls. Anyone in this town
should be able to give you spe-
cific directions to Wiseman’s
View from there. I have been
fortunate in that the lights were
in full force both times I visited,
once in July and once in Octo-
ber. But sometimes they last
only a few seconds and some-
times thirty minutes. People
see different lights, and inevery
type weather, all seasons. If
you watch long enough, you
will see them.

One final note: if you are
traveling alone, you might want
to reconsider— even a duo
might not be enough, especially
if you spook easily.

So enjoy yourself, and if
you see any lights, let me know!
