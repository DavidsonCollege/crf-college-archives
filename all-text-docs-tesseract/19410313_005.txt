The annual Founder’s Day Bah

was held at the Charlotte Country

“Club last Saturday night in honor
of the eleven new initiates of tne
fraternity. Sponsors of the func-
tion were Betsey Armistead, Rich-
mond, Va, with Claude Hackney;
Miss Mackey King, Columbia, S. C.,
with Stuart Rogers; Miss Jane Ly-
ons, Charlotte, with Bob Lefever;
Miss Marjorie Pons, Valdese, Chap-
iter Sponsor, with George Ficklen;
Miss Dot Hagood, Dillon, S. C., with
George Grantham; and Miss Martha
Withers, Davidson, with John
Crichton.

Many from out-of-town attended
the Ball. Highlight of the function
was the presentation of the cup for
the best freshman to Buck Fuqua
of Millan, Tenn.

It was in this discussion of campus
social life that Dr. Cunningham be-
came the interviewer with questions
of fraternity-non fraternity and
other problems. He praised the
fraternity set-up at Davidson com-
menting that it did much toward
bringing together the two groups.

While speaking in a chapel serv-
ice at Agnes Scott, he told the girls
that he bore greetings of Davidson
College and related that this state-
ment “brought the house down.”
He said that he learned fully as
much from that visit with Dr. Mc-
Cain and the girls as he did at the
other schools.

His stay in LaFayette College in
Pennsylvania also proved to be
very revealing and instructive since
it is a college of the same type as
Davidson (Presbyterian with a
slightly larger enrollment) and pre-
sents problems similar to David-
son's.

In attesting to the value of his
trip, Dr. Cunningham stated, “The
value of these associations has been
very great to me. The study and
understanding of colleges of a like
type has afforded a great deal of
information from .persons who for
the most part have been a number
of years engaged in the work of ed-
ucation. The information gained
will be of great value in undertak-
ing the duties of the President's of-
fice.”

The family of the new President
will move into the President's home
on the north edge of the campus
within a short time. Besides Mrs.
Cunningham the family includes
four children, three boys and one
girl. The oldest, Harriet, entered
Agnes Scott last fall. The three

lumbia, while Erb settled down at
Catawba for the week-end. Broth-

According to those who are in the
know about such mattets, last week-
end set a new record for the num-
ber of brothers eating supper on
the campus Saturday night. How-
ever, this was decidedly due not to
the number of brothers who played
the limber last week, but. to the
number (about half the chapter
wild-hares) who spent a wild, wild
few hours in Charlotte.

Dr. Cunningham was for six years
of Thelogical
Seminary before taking over the
pastorate of the First Presbyterian
Church in Winston-Salem. While
he considers that experience to be
of great value to him, the duties of
the President of the Seminary; a
graduate school with a very small
enrollment, are greatly different
from his present office.

After expressing his pleasure at
being called to the Presidency and
decision to come after thoughtful
consideration, Dr. Cunningham con-
cluded the interview with the state-
ment, “Davidson College offers an
unusual opportunity for a real
Christian service.”

This” reporter left the interview
with the impression that Dr. John
Rood Cunningham is the man to
perform that Christian service and
in doing so will have the aid of
some 680 Davidson Students.
