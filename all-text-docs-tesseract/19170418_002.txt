Mecklenburg County has the pep—
she is going to grow something to cat as
well as something to put on the contra-
band list.

Napoleon once wrote that his whole
anxiety was to obtain the victory with
the least effusion of blood possible. We
do not want the blood of the Germans
so much as we want our rights. But if
they come out on the international high-
ways we are liable to give them a drink
which will prove fatal.

Lf the Commencement Hall could
speak it would utter a sigh of relief.
Why? Because debating is almost over.

Discussion has ended. Congress set-
tled it. All factions are proving the
statement of (Latin) Gildersleeve:
“Hearts knit quickly in the stress of
war.”

A CAMPUSSISM.

Our campus is one of the prettiest in
the South. Abundant expression of its
beauty and naturalness comes from all
who have any esthetic. faculties. Let's
do our part to merit this, How? Co-
operate with Mr. Hill in getting rid of
those horrid little paths. We can do
more——we can stop throwing paper
wrappers and other things on the campus
as we are coming from the street. The
campus is a great asset to the advertising
of Davidson. It will be a better chan-
nel if it is pathless and waste paperless.

The ground west of Sprunt Field is
taking on a new aspect. It really looks
as good as a cloth of gold. Work on the
gymnasium has begun.

MR. P. V. NASBY I.

If you have heen reading these col-
umns for several weeks you have seen
that a great deal of discussion has clung
tenaciously to the name of Petroleum V.
Nasby I]. This is the name signed to a
scathing satire written about campus
conditions. It is a piece of quixotry about
campus problems. The Editor’s note
(by the Forum Editor) appended to
MclIlwaine's Forum article was inap-
propriate and was not an expression of
the staff. The satire needed no defense
hecause some had given it the wrong in-

‘erpretation. We, asa final word, wan:
to say that we regret this article ever
gracing or disgracing these columns.
Tho a piece of perfunctory sarcasm, it
was taken seriously by many. We know
that conditions on the campus have beer.
highly colored and discolored by writer:
contributing to this department. Some
of the very smallest things—altho prob-
ably supported by a mere thread of flimsy
gossip, have been magnified into severa!
times their normal dimensions. If you
—the outsider—have gotten a wrong im-
pression of our college life, we would
like to right the wrong that has been
done.

DAVIDSONIANISM.

This is the support that you should
give this publication. Not only you, but
the advertisers, make your Davipsontan
possible. Of course ads in this college
weekly bring manifold results. But the
advertiser does not always know what
benefits his investment is bringing. When
you go in the establishment of an adver-
tiser in Charlotte or anywhere else he
cannot tell you from a Yale or Prince-
ton student or a Philadelphia lawyer or
a resident of Fifth Avenue. If you are
carrying a musical instrument he does
not know you from a member of the
Harvard Orchestra or of some great
symphony company taking part in a
grand opera. What you should do is to
let him know that you have seen his ad-
vertisement in your paper. Tell him
that you are glad to see that he is taking
space in Trt Davinsonian or some-
thing to this effect. By this, he will feel
good, and the Business Manager will
feel better when he solicits his patronage
for a contract for 1917-18. Do this—
give your paper.a push. Buy from our
advertisers and let them know that they
are ours.

A Nu NOTE.

Some time ago the New York Even-
ing Post cawe out with an editorial say-
ing that “The old Southern complaint
that Southern literature is unjustly neg-
lected has lost its force” since as many
books have been sold of some — later
Southern writers as of “Northern con-
temporaries of equal ability.” A South-
erner should be glad to know this. How-
ever, there is one field where the study
of our literature is neglected—in schools,
colleges, and universities. ft is surpris-
ing to know, after looking thru) many
Southern college and university catalogs,
that none of them provide for anything
distinctly Southern in’ their literary
courses. “his should aot be—the Amer-
ican college student should study ow
literature as he studies New England o1
Western literature.

Dr. Fulton says that literature is. al-
ways a faithful picture of what has been
said’ and thought and done. “The dis-
tinctive tone of the happy Southern life
should be dearer to those below the Ma-
son and Dixon line than the life of the
Northerner or that of Shakespeare's or
Browning's day.

A new note was sounded to educators
in Macon, Ga. by Dr. Fulton. He
urged that colleges put this in their pre-
requisites for entrance into the English
department. Also, that Southern litera-
ture—one of the most distinctive—be
taught in the colleges. This is made
possible by a recent work of his “South-
ern Life in Southern Literature.” Tho
this fine selection of literature has been
on the market for a very short time, col-
leges are already beginning to order their
supply.

In a few years most of our Southern
colleges and universities will have re-
sponded to this note and the works of the
once neglected writers will be resurrect-
ed and we no longer will be a neglectful
people. Tt will be a glad day when this

Did you ever stop to think
of the direct advantages to be gained from
printing that will catch the eye and hold it long@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
sameness—a_ tendency
around-more’’ disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little different, if not entirely
distinctive, when compared with the current station-
ery that reaches his office.

We invite a careful and studied analysis of the
samples we always keep on hand for your inspection.
