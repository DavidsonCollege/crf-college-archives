Volleyball picks up two wins in Arizona

By Witson McCrory

Davidson continued its early-season
struggles in the first two games of the
LaQuinta/Northern Arizona Invitational, fall-
ing to Akron and UC Riverside, but recov-
ered to win the final two games of the tourna-
ment against host Northern Arizona and Rider
to record the first two victories of the young
season.

Davidson opened play on Friday against
Akron (5-1), who dominated on offense to take
a 3-0 (30-20, 30-22, 30-22) victory over the
*Cats. Jenna Dykstra ’07 hit .778 with 28 as-
sists and seven kills on the day, and Liz

Williamson’07 tallied 11 kills, but their efforts

were not enough to propel an otherwise ane-
mic Wildcat offense. Overall, Davidson hit just
.138 for the match, while Akron hit over .400
in all three games.

In the second half of the double-header,
Davidson hung tough with UC Riverside (5-
1), taking the first game from the Highland-
ers 30-28, and nearly grabbing a 2-0 lead in
the second frame before falling 30-27. The
Wildcats were unable to muster much offense
in the third and fourth games, however, as
Davidson had a -.013 attack percentage in the
next two frames for a 3-1 loss.

Davidson rebounded on the second day of
the tournament, however, claiming victories
of North Arizona and Rider to improve to 2-7
on the season.

The Wildcats swept Northern Arizona 3-0
(30-26, 30-25, 30-24) in the first game. on
Saturday, and were paced by freshman Kate
Pierucci, who tallied 14 kills on a .400 attack
percentage.

Dykstra, meanwhile, posted 40 of the 43
Wildcat assists for the match, and Lindsay

‘a

Katie Pierucci 08 and Jenna Dykstra ’07 team up for the block.

Woeste ’08 notched 10 digs.

The Wildcats also felt relieved after their
first victory in eight tries, a$ Kate Pierucci 08
said after the win, “It felt great. The first one
is always the hardest so it was great to get it
out of the way. All the hard work from pre-
season on finally paid off.

In the final game of the tournament, the
Wildcats posted a 3-1 (30-26, 30-17, 25-30,
30-27) victory over the Rider Broncos. The
’Cats hit a season-high .257 for the match,
including 20 kills for Williamson. Dykstra

posted an incredible SO assists in the match,
and senior Tamara Gallen’’05 registered 20
digs.

Dykstra was the only Wildcat selected to
the All-Tournament team, with an average of
36 assists per game over the weekend.

Despite a 2-2 split on the weekend, the
Wildcats returned home encouraged by the
tournament results, as Pierucci says, “We fi-
nally found some type of chemistry, and it just
came together. We started working well, and
we should be able to keep it up all year.”

rankings, and is third on the money list this
year despite only one victory, but his playing

. is best-described as erratic since he last won a

major at the 2002 U.S. Open. He has made
more headlines for his engagement, his return
to the Titleist driver and his feud with former
coach Butch Harmon than any low number
on the scoreboard.

But he is still the torch-bearer for golf, and
needs to be at the top of the game.

Vijay Singh, while an incredible player,
cannot carry golf in a way Tiger can. He does
make news, but more often than not it has
nothing to do with his golf game. He is noto-
riously stand-offish from the media and fans
alike.

Singh is almost as noted for his blatantly
sexist comments against Annika Sorenstam
before the Colonial last year as he is for his
swing.

Mickelson and Els are slightly more char-
ismatic, and also have games to match Singh’s,
but they too will never have the star-power
that Tiger has on tour. When Mickelson, for
example, won his first major in dramatic fash-
ion this past spring at The Masters with a thnill-
ing birdie on the 72nd green, viewership was
still down 17 percent from last year and 50
percent from Tiger’s ’97 win.

Vijay, Els and Mickelson will continue to
make compelling golf by being at the top of
leader-boards, but this week, as golf reaches
its biggest international stage at the Ryder Cup,
Tiger needs to begin the reclamation of his
once insurmountable throne. No more talk
about progress, and how his swing feels bet-
ter than ever.

Whether he needs to make up with Harmon,
dump Elin, or go back to Titleist, Tiger has to
shine this week at Oakland Hills and next year
on the Tour. Golf desperately needs the return
of the fist-pump, the thrashing swing, and red
in the final group on Sunday.
