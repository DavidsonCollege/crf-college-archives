Survey reveals cable

does not affect studying ©

By Kate GILLESPIE
Senior Staff Writer

An annual survey conducted re-
cently by Associate Professor of
Political Science Pat Sellers’ Public
Opinion class has revealed that
Davidson students are studying more
and watching only slightly more TV
than they did last year, despite the fact
that students now receive cable TV
service in dorm rooms.

The survey shows that students on
average watch 3.08 hours of TV and
study 21.85 hours per week.

Both figures have increased from
the 2.45 hours of weekly TV view-
ing and 20.13 hours of weekly study-
ing that students reported last year,
but the rise in TV viewing is not sta-
tistically significant according to
Sellers.

The survey was sent via email toa

random sample of over 900 students,
or about half of the student body.

Sellers reported a 52 percent re-
sponse rate from students.

Although the amount of time spent
studying has increased overall, stu-
dents who responded in a separate
question that they supported the
administration’s decision to bring
cable TV into dorm rooms averaged
only 19.94 hours of weekly study-
ing.

The 24 percent of respondents who
did not support the decision, on the
other hand, reported they studied an
average of 27.98 hours per week.

The statistics showing that having

‘cable TV in dorms has not signifi-

cantly affected academic life has
come as good news to RLO, as well
as to the SGA representatives who
fought for the passage of the resolu-

Davidson student Amy Jendrek
08 competed against 14 other col-
lege students in the “Jeopardy!” Col-
lege Tournament filmed at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh from October
9-10.

Jendrek made it to the semifinals
of the competition and appeared on

a show that aired November 10, as
well as one that will air on Novem-
ber 18.
Jendrek tried out for the show with
her father and younger sister in May.
“My family has always watched
“Jeopardy!” together,” Jendrek said.

“One day we saw an ad that they were
having tryouts in Nashville, which
is like two hours from my house. We

Mass emails creating problems

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

A chain of mass emails started by

~ Arifuz Zaman ’08 early in the semes-

ter generated ahostile response from
members of the student body.

A later unauthorized email by
Cameron Hardesty ’07 received a
reportedly “positive” reaction from
the majority of students.

The email aimed to generate sup-
port for the Davidson women’s soc-
cer team.

Zaman started a chain of mass
emails as a joke several weeks ago
and more recently replied to

. Hardesty’s mass email. Student com-

plaints led to the suspension of
Zaman’s email account after both
incidents.

Despite the negative response to
his emails, Zaman downplays the
event.

“T didn’t realize it was such a big
deal,” he said.

When asked whether he feels any
regret, Zaman said, “besides random
kids hating me, not really.”On No-
vember 5, Hardesty sent out a mass
email that encouraged fan support for
the Davidson’s women soccer team
in the SoCon tournament.

Reactions to the email were much
more positive than with Zaman’s
email.

“T got a lot of really positive re-
plies,” said Hardesty. “About 20
people replied back to give encour-
agement.” :

. Hardesty does list one negative
reaction.

“(A student] wrote me back an
email with a lot of expletives and
things like ‘didn’t you read the user
license agreement.””

Hardesty said that an email dia-
logue developed between the two
and that peaceful terms were not
reached.

Although she herself began one,
Hardesty condemns the mass email
started by Zaman.

“IT thought that was one of the
dumbest things I’ve ever read,” she
said. “I think that was kind of a silly
way to use it.”

The mass emails come at a time
when many students are sending out
authorized surveys for class projects.
The mass emails do not seem to be
interfering with their responses.

Young Life helps students grow their faith

By Liz Barry
Senior Staff Writer

With cheeks flushed and the smell |

of bonfire embedded in her jacket,
Emily Presley ’07 entered the library
still buzzing from an evening spent
roasting marshmallows and sharing
stories with local high school stu-
dents.

Presley is one of 41 Davidson stu-
dents who devote countless hours to
Young Life, a national organization
aimed at “introducing adolescents to
Jesus Christ and helping them grow
in their faith.”

During the school year, Young Life
leaders organize and enact weekly
club meetings, bible study groups and
contact work.

Because of the religious require-
ments necessary to become a leader,
Young Life is not recognized as an
official Davidson club.

There is a team of leaders for each
high school in the area ¢

“T sometimes feel that Young Life
is completely set apart from my ex-
perience on the Davidson campus,
and that can be difficult,” Janie
Gonzalez ’05 said. ““What has kept
me involved is knowing that what I

do has eternal value.

“The fact that so many high school
girls look up to me for guidance and
advice reminds me that I am in their
lives for a reason.”

Weekly club meetings usually in-
clude creative games, songs and skits
followed by abrief gospel discussion.
Young Life leaders work hard to or-
ganize these events, which serve to
reach out to young people in a re-
laxed, informal atmosphere.

“T never thought getting covered
in shaving cream or drinking choco-
late syrup could be so satisfying, or
