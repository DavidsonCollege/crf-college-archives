Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Wildcats of Davidson invaded Charlotte Tuesday night to snatch the season
opener from a scrappy Wake Forest team. Nearly 11,000 partisan fans packed tlie
Coliseum to see the Cats down the Deacons 95-88.

Davidson, ranked third in the
UPI preseason poll, got off to
an agonizing slow start. trail-
ing 17-7 after six minutes of
play. Although the sagging
zone defense employed by the
Deacons never kept the Wild-
cats from getting good shots,

There’s no doubt that Driesell

There's nothing of the hulking

his size.

The only people he cares to
terrify are his basketball op-
ponents. and his teams do a
terrific job of that. He is a
confident man whose very pre-
sence is encouraging. It is a
theory of his that a team is in
the game to win, and one feels
that maybe that is one reason
his teams do just that.

A LONG TIME WINNER

Driesell is no stranger to
winning basketball. He was
captain of the Granby High
School team that won the Vir-
ginia state championship in
1950; It was a.Cinderella tourna-

Granby surprise everyone. “We

Fred Hetzel pumped in a 10

to stay. When the half-time
buzzer sounded, the Red and
Black were out in front 45-34,
and it looked like tae game was
all over.

The second half saw David-

Davidson Sports Writer

“He’s probably the hardest working coach in the profession today.” That is the tribute paid to Davidson's bas-
ketball coach Charles (Lefty) Driesell by Athletic Dire ctor Tom Scott.

Dr. Scott went on to say, “He team won on the strength of a . games, both of them to the same

boy “recruited ... from a pool
room who was 6° 8°’.

-He was graduated from Duke
where he played basketball un-
der Coach Harold Bradley. and
was a forward on the Blue
Devil team that won the 1954
Classic.

For the next two years while
working with Ford Motor Com-
pany he played setni-pro bas-
ketball. The T-Model Terror won
the distinction from newspapers
of having a ‘‘golden arm” for
-his playin this league. His fame
on the court was boosted some.
what by his -compiling a 35
point: scoring average.

In 1956 he felt the call to‘enter
coaching. He returned to his
high school alma mater and as
a teacher-coach he led the jun-
dor varsity to an 184 season.
‘This included a 13 game winning
‘streak. The next year he moved
up to the varsity which had
won only three games during
the previous season. Under his
direction. Granby posted a 15-

then issued the bid. and he took
the helm of a team which had
a 2l-gauge streak going for
them. Driesell proceeded to
pilot fhe high-schoolers to 36
more victories over the next
two seasons before losing by
two overtime points late in the
1958 season.

This produced a 25-0 season

school, Woodrow. Wilson High
School.

After another winning season
at Newport News, Driesell came
to Davidson in 1961 to replace
retiring coach Tom Scott. Once
again; it was a school connect-
ed with Woodrow Wilson that
brought * halt to Driesell's
winning avays. The 9-14 season
in his first year at Davidson
gave him his only losing season
as a coach.

Before. Driesell came. how-
ever, the Wildcats had been a
consistent seventh or eighth
‘place finisher in the Southern
Conference. He began ito mold
them into a feared power. His
first game was @ victory over
nationally-ranked Wake Forest.

Needless to say, this was
something of an upset. As in
another season, that first year
saw giant-killer Davidson fall
to a smaller school, for the
Baptismal drowning was fol-
lowed the next week by a loss
to Catawba College.

Driesell brought to Davidson
a desire to win and a good or-
ganization. He believes in honest
play but not in fielding a var-
sity team so that the boys will
get the exercise. In talking to
him one feels that he does not
want a smalltime victory.

He is not concerned with
patsy schools. When he talks
about college basketball, he
talks about UCLA. the Cincin-
nati team of the turn of the
decade, and. of course David-
‘son.

DEFENSE VITAL

For his teams he puts his
emphasis on containing the oth-
er team. “I've always based my
philisophy of coaching on de-
fense. I think it's what has en:
abled us to be fairly success-
ful. Most kids nowdays know
how to shoot, but not all know
their defense. Every team that
has been great has been strong
on defense. Look at Cincinnati
or UCLA.

It was said of his high school
players that they ran to the
scorekeepers table after every
game like most other boys. The
difference was that Driesell’s
players did not ask how many
points they got. themselves but
how many did their man get.

Along with desire to win and
an emphasis on defense, Drie-
sell brought an extensive re-
cruiting effort to Davidson.
Said Dr. Scott, ‘‘No trip is too
long, no boy is too far away to
look into as a prospect. Further-
more, it’s more than just find-
ing five basketball players: it’s
finding the right kind. With
Hetzel leaving this year. we
needed height so he went aft-
er some and got 6'8”" and 6°10"
boys.

“First of all,’ says Drteseil,
“you've got to get a lot of boys
interested. It’s like any other
selling job-the more people you
see. the better chance you've
got.”

Davidson's academic stand-
ards are an extra attraction
for prospective players. ‘‘A real
good education is the primary
thing I try to sell them. A lot
of schools have a good basket-
ball team, but I don't think
there’s a schoo] in the country

three back-to-back to make the
score 78-61 with seven minutes
left in the game.

Marcon then fouled out, and
was followed shortly by Het-
zel and Snyder. Ronnie Stone,
Phil Squier. and Paul Briggs
came off the bench to put down
a last minute Deacon bid, Stone
pumping in six and Briggs five
in the final minutes.

Davidson's offense, after
breaking the opening ice, could
not be stopped. The defense,
however, was another story.

Questioned about the game,
Coach Lefty Drisell replied,
(Overall, our offense looked
good, but our defense left a
lot to be desired.’ When asked
to elaborate, he replied, ‘‘I’
(the defense) stunk.”

He attributed the defensive
lapse to basic fundamental
mistakes. Drisell’s analysis was
substantiated when examina-
tion of the statistics revealed
that Wake Forest had taken 45
shots in the second half to David-

that can offer them a better
education.”’

Driesell’s first recruit was
last year’s team captain Terry
Holland who finished fourth
in the nation in field goal per-
centages with 63.1 per cent.
As the Delights a la Driesell
began to rise to the varsity
squad. Davidson began to win.

His second year with the Wild-

cats produced a 14-10 mark and
the record has improved each
season since.

Last year he led the ‘Cats as
high as third in the national
ranking and finished tenth in
the nation for the year and
second in the conference with
a 20-4 season. For the improve-
ment he has inspired. Driesell

TEAGUE TACKLED IN TUESDAY’S ACTION

Hangs On To The Ball

Hetzel Holds Wildcat Hopes

By NEVILLE PATTERSON

Davidsonian Sports Writer

A nationally - publicized
basketball magazine said in
a recent article that Fred
Hetzel is Davidson’s most
famous alumnus since Dean
Rusk.

Hetzel has been praised. pro-
phesied about and statistically
analyzed by every magazine
that pretends to take an interest
in athletics. State and regional
newspapers have interviewed,
photographed and applauded
him on their front pages as well
as in their traditional sports
section.

Davidson's Publicity and Ath-
letic Departments have prepar-
ed a recruiting folder for Coach
Lefty Driesell to send out by
the thousands. This pamphlet,
describing the basketball team
and the school in general, de-
votes two-thirds of a page to
just listing Hetzel's basketball
honors and records.

SPECTACULARLY
UNSPECTACULAR

Last fall, Hetzel was describ-
ed as being a spectacularly un-
spectacular ball player, because
he scored his twenty-five points
with such smoothness that one
didn't realize he had been put-
ting out a great effort.

This. was explained by Coach
Driesell’s comments on Hetzel.
“Fred is an unselfish ball play-
er. He averages only nineteen

shots a game, and during the
last two years, I’ve seen him
take no more than two or three
bad shots. He is a team ball
player and passes. the ball off
rather than try to raise his ave-
rage with a risky shot.”

To attest to Hetzel’s smooth,
capable play, Driesell offered,
“We keep a record posted of
the mistakes that the players
make in scrimmage. Fred is
making fewer than any of the
rest.”’

When asked to remember the
worst defeat in his basketball
eareer he replied. “‘When I
was a senior in prep school, I
played in the B'nai B'rith Tour-
nament in Allentown, Penn. I
was assigned to guard a guy
by the name of Charles Mar-
con. Being slower than he was.
I couldn’t keep up with him.
He scored 27 points and had
the best night of his high school
career. Hetzels’ roomate, Char-
lie Marcon, just smiled.

BIGGEST WIN

Hetzel considers the 1962 win
over Duke to be. his sweetest
victory. He said that he feels
being picked this year as a
preseason choice for All-Ameri-
can is his greatest honor. When
asked who the best player he
had played against was he
limited his answer to those men
he has actually guarded.

“I guess the best men I’ve
guarded were in the Bast-West
Game and in the Olympic

their season with a 75-59 win over Wingate Junior Col-
lege in the preliminary game at Charlotte Coliseum Tues-

day night.

5 rebounds, respectively.

Coach Terry Holland. in com-
menting after the game, said.
“We played well. and I was

looking ahead to our one with
