Ithas been suggested that the
information contained in this col-
umn could be garnered in other,
less visible, locations. This is ab-
solutely true; you can easily jog
over to Student Health Services
and obtain this information. But,
let’s face it, it can be embarrass-

ing to walk into Student Health
Services, surrounded by people

with common colds, and start
leafing through pamphlets on
chlamydia and genital warts. So
most people just don’t bother,
and that lack of information can
be a matter of life and death.

I would like to take this op-
portunity to publish am article
written by Stephanie Glaser and
Jennifer Humphrey on béhalf of
the Student Health Options and
Concerns Committee (SHOC).

dom covers the warts and pre-
vents contact with warts on the

Crabs, also known as pubic
lice, is one STD that you actu-
ally can catch from a toilet seat.
Pubic lice look like crabs, are

yellow grey, and get darker as
they feed on your blood. The

symptoms include itchy bites,
mild fever, swollen lymph
glands, aching muscles, and blue
grey patches on abdomen, thighs,
and genitals. This is by far the
easiest STD to diagnose and
treat; crabs are visible to the hu-
man eye and can be treated with
a prescription or over-the-
counter shampoo. ,
Herpes is another diamond

of an STD; once you get it, you
have it forever. The fever blis-
‘ters can be controlled but not
cured with a new drug called
acyclovir. Herpes can be trans-
mitted from fever blisters on the
mouth to the genitals. Gonor-
rhea and syphilis are also fairly
common STDs. They share
many of the same symptoms of
chlamydia and can be treated

The three most common
STDs on college campuses in
this area are chlamydia, condy-
loma, and crabs. (As chlamydia
was covered in last week’s issue,
we’ll continue with condyloma
and crabs.) Condyloma, other-
wise known as genital warts, has
increased dramatically on col-

lege campuses. Although this _ with antibiotics.

If you don't recycle this
Davidsonian, it had better
be because you plan to
treasure it forever.

Rather than “save” the forest,
which implies setting it aside un-
der a glass case, the forest should
be managed. The people who in-
habit these parts of the world need

able to manage the land which
supports them.

viable. If the Brazilian farmers and
ranchers stopped burning small
plots of forest they might preserve
the species-rich forest, but they
would all die of starvation in the
process.

Buying a plotofrainforest may
look nice on paper; but unfortu-
nately, there are no environmental
police to keep the native people

from using the resources on that
land.

It would be much more profit-
able, both environmentally and
economically, to put funds towards
agricultural extension and land
management programs within the
countries where rapid deforesta-
tion is taking place.

These programs would greatly
benefit the people who inhabit the
forests. There is also a need for
funding for more research along
these lines.

to provide support for the people
who populate the rainforest and
help to preserve their way of life.
Become informed about current
environmental ‘issues and discuss
them with your friends. There are
several environmental groups that
distribute their funds for research
and extension programs. One such
group is:
Rainforest Action Network

San Francisco, CA 94133

Write to Rainforest Action and
give your support for such pro-
grams.

Finally, inform yourself about
local environmental issues by at-
tending Davidson’s Environmental
Action meetings every other
Monday night P.M. in the Union.

The next meeting will be held
Monday, September 16.

Bone Marrow: Pass This Test!

By Catherine McEaddy

Have you ever wondered what
it might be like to have your life
threatened? Now, I don’t mean
something like a near miss with an
oncoming car or your brother
coming close to killing you be-
cause you stole his clothes.

I mean areal life or death situ-
ation that you have no control over.
In fact, your only hope of coming
out on top is dependent upon the
kindness of a complete stranger.
Kind of makes you think, doesn’t
it?

At least three Davidson stu-
dents have had their lives threat-
ened and have indeed succeeded.
But without the kindness of others,
they might not be here today to tell
you about it.

What in the worldam I talking
about, you ask? I’m talking about
bone marrow transplants and the
opportunity you have this fall to
try to save a life.

Last year, Davidson College
helda Bone Marrow Registry Drive
for all students. All that was re-
quired was a little blood drawn so
that marrow couldbe tested for a

match. $30,000 was raised, ena-
bling 476 possible donors to be
tested.

That is an incredible achieve-
ment.for the very first year! But
whataboutthis year? Simple math
will tell you that there are-at least
1000 students that can be tested
this year. Now, if youare one of
those 1000 students, a myriad of
reasons can keep you from being
tested.

Financially, it costs each per-
son that is being tested $60. If able,
youareasked to providethatmoney
yourself. However, if you are not
financially able, donot fear. Much
of the money that is raised is for
students that want to donate but
would be unable to do so because
of finances.

Youmightnot wantto be tested
because needles make you queasy

orthe sight of blood will make you |

faint. I can tell you right now (ask
any of my friends), I am the big-
gest wimp when it comes to pain.

I forced myself to go under
false bravery because an eight year
old bone marrow donor told me
how easy it was and to quit being a

scaredy-cat. And you know what?
She was right. It was very easy and
it was over before I even knew it.

So what can you do to get in-
volved? Throughout the fall there
will be activities that you can sup-
port. This Tuesday there isa study
break in the 900 room. Go to it.

Free ice cream and Cokes and
lots of information on how youcan
get more involved await all com-
ers. Soon there will be t-shirts for
those who give a donation to the
Giftof Life fund. Look for them to
be on sale at football games and in
the dorms in early October.

The Bone Marrow Drive Com-
mittee will also be sponsoring other
study breaks and activities such as
successful bone marrow donorsand
people in need of bone marrow:
speaking about their experiences.

So give the gift of life. Get in-
volved. And support the 1991
Davidson Bone Marrow Drive.
Let’s get 100% participation!

Briggs Joins French Department

By Virginia Mischén
Judging from the number of stu-
dents who have been flowing in
and out of his office the past few
days, Jonathan Briggs is an en-
thused and dedicated teacher. New
to Davidson this fall, he joins the
French Department as a visiting
professor.

He comes to us from UNC-
Chapel Hill, where he received his
master’s degree. Presently, he is
A.B.D., which he explains means
“All But Dissertation.” In his doc-

torate work, he is studying French
theater from the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.

Briggs raved about his experi-
ences abroad. He has spenta great
deal of time in France; he has lived
in Brittany and Provence and out-
side of Paris. Muchrimpressed with
Davidson’s study abroad opportu-
nities, he strongly recommends
them to students. “Living in an-
other culture isan experience you’ll
take with you the rest of your life,”
he said.

Presently, Briggs i is teaching
the intermediate. and advanced
intermediate levels of French. He
hopes someday to teach literature
and cultural history, which are his
specialties.

All his classes and committee
meetings make his time goby very
quickly, but apparently he doesn’t
mind this hectic lifestyle. “I’m only
happy if I’m busy,” he explained.
Obviously he has already recog-

nized the key to contentment at
Davidson.
