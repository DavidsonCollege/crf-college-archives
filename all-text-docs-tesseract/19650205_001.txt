GREEK WEEK CHARIOT RACE
Sig Eps Race Around Patterson Court

GREEK WEEK CONCLUDES

Pledges Endure Pains

Tomorrow will be greeted with a gasp of relief as the Greek Week activities for
over 200 freshmen end. The week’s activities have included everything from the care
of dead bodies to chariot racing.

Greek Week activities began
on Monday with a banquet for
all pledges: and pledge trainers
at the College Union, The speak-
er at the banquet was Dr. Wil-
liam McK. Wright who spoke
to the pledges about ‘‘Brother-
hood,” with special emphasis
on the duties of pledges. Wright,
the first IFC speaker for the
semester, has contributed artic-
les to Banta’s Greek Exchange,
a national Greek letter fraterni-
ty magazine.

On Wednesday the first Greek
Week Annual Field Day was
held at Patterson Fraternity
Court. The first event of the day
was a chariot race. followed by
a tug-of-war across the creek.
Chariots were to be constructed

Library Now Open
Until 12 Midnight

The Davidson College
Library is now open each
weekday night until mid-
night. This new closing
time initisted on Feb. 1, is
designed to provide more
service to the student
body.

The new schedule will
be in effect for one semes-
ter on a trial basis to see
if student use warrants
such a plan. A survey of
attendance on random
nights will be made be-
tween the reguler closing
hour of eleven and the
new closing hour to deter-
mine the student response.

The Sibrary’s extended
hours are e result of re-
quests made often in the
past by the Student Coun-
cll and THE DAVIDSON.

by the pledges for less than $5
apiece, and could be pulled by
four pledges, with two pledges
riding in the chariots.

The $5 limit for materials
limited the appearance of the
“chariots” which included modi-
fied -bicycles, wheel barrows,
and little red wagons. The Sig-
ma Chi's bright red churiot was
the closest thing that resembled
a chariot while the Sig Ep’s
roller skate vehicle was by far
the noisest. After three heats,
won by the ATO’s, Phi Gams,
and Sigma Chis, there was a
final race which was won
handily by the ATOs after a
collision at the start of the race
upset the Sigma Chis and the
Phi Gams. Piloting the ATO
chariot were Lowell Bryan,
Geoff Birkhead, Julian Prosser,
and Jim McLaughiln, with Bill
Schmickle and Holmes Eleazer
as passengers.

The tug-of-war was won by
the SAE’s after many competi-
tors ended up standing in the
creek.

Besides the IFC sponsored
Field Day and Banquet, each
of the 12 fraternities have kept
their pledges busy with work
projects as well as odd jobs at
the fraternity houses. Most
pledges have risen with the
dawn to march in cadence to
breakfast, and’ many felt moved
to sing songs before entering
the house.

The early morning strains of
“Dixie Rose” which floated up
to the dorms, for example, came
from a group of shivering KA
pledges standing outside their
fraternity house. Brightly col-
ored shirts were seen on campus
this week worn by Pika, Sigma
Nu and KA pledges.

P edge projects completed by
each pledge class included: Pika
—Painting United Presbyterian
church of Davidson; KA—Paint-
ing fence at McEver Field in Da-
vidson, Sigma Nu—Painting sur-
olus jet aircraft at Mooresville

Carolina’s ‘‘Commun-

After initiating the movement:
with a resolution calling for the
repeal of ,the “gag law,” the
local AUUP chapter led the
whole faculty to adopt a simi-
lar resolution and is now seek-
ing the aid of individuals and
organizations throughout the
state in an effort to achieve re-
peal of the law.

Carrying their cause to a
meeting of the full faculty on
Jan. 19, the AAUP professors
presented a resolution similar
to their own, which the faculty
adopted by a vote of 56 to 7.

The faculty's resolution urged
that the gag law be repealed
because of the faculty’s feeling
that ‘‘this law imposes unneces-
sary and inappropriate restric-
tions upon the officers of the
institutions concerned. . . and
will, in the long run, prove to
be extremely detrimental to the
reputation and good name of
North Carolina's state-supported
institutions of higher learning.”

Evenings, until 10 p. m., were
usually spent by the pledges at

pledge tests, or in house clean-
ups.

‘Students
To Oppose

Gag Law

A group of Davidson students
formed a committee this week
to work in conjunction with the
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors Speaker-Ban
Committee in its efforts to have
the “Speaker-Ban law" repeal-
ed.
| Under the leadership of sen-
ior Jim Waldron, the loosely or-
ganized student committee
hopes to obtain the endorsement
of the AAUP’ Committee within
the next few weeks.

With this endorsement, says

Waldron, the students’ job would
be “to supplement the actions
, of the AAUP Committee, rather
‘than to work autonomously. We
would be prepared to work for
them and to help them by do-
ing things they need done, but
can't do themselves.”

Among the possible actions of
the committee would be efforts
to get student newspapers and
student governments in colleges
throughout North Carolina to
take stands on the ‘‘Speaker-Ban
law.”

The committee would also
work at Davidson to encourage
student support for all con-
structive efforts to promote the
repeal of the law. This would

_ include seeking endorsements

from the various students or-
ganizations.

In actions already taken, the
committee has prepared a sum-
mary of its preliminary legal
research into possible avenues
take stands on the ‘“‘Speaker-Ban
law” on the basis of federal
constitutional law.

Among the avenues of attack
; would be the contention that
the law is too vague, as well as
‘the fact that it violates the

.{| First Amendment. which relates

to freedom of speech. Although
the committee hopes that the
law will be repealed by legisla-
tion. it would be willing to have
the case taken to the Supreme
Court on the above-mentioned
basis.

The student committee is not
vet fully organized. and it hopes
that other interested students
will soon join it.

April when they passed. a reso-
lution opposing the ‘gag law,”
but. they withheld it from pub-
lication during last year's politi-
cal campaign, releasing it on
Jan. 15.

In the statement, the profes-
sors expressed their opposition
to the law “as professional edu-
cators, as Christians, as Ameri-
cans, as North Carolina tax-
payers, and as parents.”

“As educators,” they said,
“‘we know that minds grow to
their fullest in an atmosphere
of controversy and argument,
and that excellence is achieved
when the fewest possible restric:
tions are imposed upon the free-
dom of students to inquire.

“We are proud to be citizens
of a country that enjoys free-
dom of speech,” continued the
professors. ‘‘The blood of our
fathers. and some of our own,
has been shed for that free-
dom; we love it too much to
adopt the methods of tyrants in
order to protect it.’’

At the time of the release of
the AAUP’s resolution, the or-
ganization also appointed a
Speaker-Ban Committee to con-
duct a camphign to have the
law repealed.

The committee—composed of
Professors Richard Gift, Chair-
man, Louise Nelson, W. B. Pat-
terson. P. B. Secor, and Locke
White—began its work by fram-
ing the resolution the faculty
passed. It then proceeded to put

left for Europe on Jan. 24. They
plan to return to Davidson on
Feb. 15.

Martin first traveled to Can-
nes, France. to attend the In-
ternational Conference on Stud-
ent Exchange and Travel Pro-
grams, which ended on Jan. 29.
Robert Stone, assistant to the
president, said that Martin was
urged to make the trip by Dr.
J. O. Embry, professor of
French. ‘It was felt that Dav-
idson should be represented at
the conference since we now
have a Junior Year Abroad
Program," said Stone.

Martin is presently visiting
the two Davidson Junior Year
Abroad Programs at Montpelier.
France. and Marburg, Germany.
He will then travel to Paris to
visit the two French girls who
were guests of the Martin family
in Davidson for several weeks
this past summer. :

Dr. and Mrs. Martin plan to
complete their trip by visiting
their son Mike and his wife at
Rennes. France. While there
they will be able to see their
new grandson for the first time.

into effect its current program
aimed at enlisting the support
of individuals and organizations
throughout the state.

Explaining that the function
of the Speaker-Ban Committee
is primarily educational, Chair-
man Gift said, ‘I feet that the
people of North Carolina don’t
understand the law and that
when it is understood, it will be
repealed.”

In carrying out its ‘‘educa-
tional” program, the committee
has prepared an editorial re-
sponse for WBT in Charlotte
and is working on an article for

“the national’ bulletin of fhe

AAUP. If the need arises. it is
also ready for further press and
TV presentations.

The committee is actively so-
liciting the aid of other organi:
zations in North Carolina. The
state board of the N, C. League
of Women Voters has already
announced its opposition to the
gag-law.

Davidson Chapter President
J. H.. Ostwalt has sent a letter
to all other AAUP chapters in
the state urging them to join
in the fight to obtain repeal of
the law. Chairman Gift is
“fairly optimistic” concerning
a response from these chapters
and feels that ‘only with the
leverage obtained by contacts
with other organizations will
our opposition to the Speaker-
Ban law be fruitful.”

The committee is also work. |

ing to enlist the support of in-
dividuals, both alumni and stu-
dents, throughout the state. Ost-
walt has received ‘“‘very en-
couraging” support in the form
of letters and money from
judges, educators, physicians,
and other professional men; he
has also received some harshly
critical letters from people not
in favor of the AAUP stand.

In other -actions, the Davidson
professors presented their case
to the Mecklenburg delegation
to the General Assembly on Jan.
27. Ostwalt reported that the
delegation gave them a ‘very
courteous and patient reception,
though they didn’t say if they
had formed an opinion.” Sev-
eral of the Mecklenburg dele-
gates voted for the Speaker-
Ban law.

The law, which bans commun.
ists or persons who have plead-
ed the Fifth Amendment from
appearing at any state-operated
educational _ institution. was
rushed through the N. C. legis-

i lature in the closing minutes of

the 1963 session.

According to Ostwalt, “The
law has caused a negative re-
action in the academic com-
munity throughout the whole
-nation."”

College President D. Grier
Martin publicly expressed his
opposition to the law shortly
after it was passed ‘stating that
he felt the law was unnecessary
and detrimental to the state
programs of higher education in
North Carolina.

Faculty Members React
To Gag Law Proposal

By BOB VANCE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The recent stand of the Dav-
idson chapter of the Americar
Association of University Pro-
fessors and the College faculty
in opposition to the ‘Speaker-
Ban Law” has caused Davidson
professors to comment in a va-
riety of ways as to their feelings
on the matter.

Expressing a widely-held point
of view, Dr. P. B. Secor stated,
“This kind of law actually in-
creases the possibility of the
spread of communism becatse
it often tends psychologically to
enhance the attraction to the
young of ‘forbidden fruit.’
Where powerful ideas are sup-

pressed, they often become more
effective underground.

“These kinds “of laws give
Communists ammunition -for
charges that we don't take ser-
iously our freedom of speech,
of the press, of religion, etc.,”
continued Secor. ‘‘They say that
one class in our society tries
to maintain its: own interests by
having a closed society. by pro-
hibiting ideas which might be
subversive.”

Secor emphasized.. however.
that what he found most offen-
sive in the law was its making
it impossible for people who
have pleaded the Fifth Amend-
ment to speak in state schools.

“It is a fundamental right
that no man should be required
to testify against himself, for

whatever reason.’’ Secor declar-
ed. “It's a dangerous. sick
situation when a person is pen-
alized by our saying that he's
less than qualified to speak be-
cause he once pleaded the Fifth.
This contsitutional right civilizes
us and distinguishes us from
the Communists.”

Presenting a different view of
the ‘‘gag-law” question. Dr. J.
W. Reid said, “I see the point
‘of view of a legislator who's un-
willing to supply ready-made
facilities and a ready-made au-
dience to those speakers who
openly advocate the overthrow
of our government.” Continued
Reid, ‘“‘I don’t define the limits
of freedom of speech, but
would leave it to the legisla-
ture.”

REPORT DUE MARCH 1

Fraternities Evaluated

By WALT DRAKE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The fraternity evaluation,
committee, organized by
the Student Council and
under the chairmanship of
Will Jackson, will issue a re-
port of its findings on March
1. This report will be dis-
tributed to students, faculty
and administration, and will
summarize the actions and
findings of the committee
since its formation several
months ago.

The basis for the committee's
formation and its continuance
revolves around the question.
“Are the fraternities serving
the needs of Davidson College
and its students. and are there
specific steps that may be taken
to meet the needs?" The com-
mittee is open to volunteers, and
presently serving on the com-
mittee are Bill Council, Pat
Fisher. - Rufus Hallmark. Ed
Haselden, Art Ross, Rick von
Unwerth, Paxton Wray, Assist-
ant Dean of Students Robert
Jones, Assistant Director of Ad-
missions Robert Young, Chap-
lain Will Terry, Dr. John Kelton,
and chairman Will Jackson.

Several courses of action have
been taken by the committee.

and the March report will pre-

Court Plans Analysis

Hugh Allen has resumed his position as Chairman of the ;

Honor Court for second semester.

Allen. a senior from Win-

stonSalem was forced to drop out of school during first

semester due to illness.

Dick Bates. Vice-Chairman of the

Honor Court served as Chairman during Allen’s absence. Bates
will now return to his position of Vice-Chairman.

A special election will be conducted next week to elect a
representative from the sophomore class to the Honor Court.
The representative elected will fill the vancancy left by sopho-
more Steve Humphrey who has left Davidson to travel and
study in Europe. Those who wish to be candidates in this
election are asked to contact Hugh Allen sometime this week.

The Honor Court also hopes to undergo some self-analysis.
The court plans to look into its policies and discuss better
means of orienting Freshmen to the Honor System at Davidson.
It also plans to discuss how it can be.more effective. Chair-
man Alien stated very definitely that this does not mean in-
creased observations or trials, but rather the maintenance of
an efficient and respected honor system.

sent some results of these ac-
tions. A notice was distributed
to the student body requesting
interested persons to express in
writing their comments on the
present fraternity situation.
Jackson estimated that around
twenty persons submitted state-
ments to the committee.
Other questionnaires were
composed by the committee arid
sent to different groups to as-
sess the situation. The presidents
of the IFC, Student Council.

last ten years at Davidson were
asked to express their opinion

they attended Davidson. Also..

class of the past ten years, and
were polled as to their evalua-
tion of the fraternity system.
Jackson stated that the response
to these questionnaires has been
heavy and. will be useful to the
committee.

The committee also plans to
send prepared questionnaires to
other schools in order to find
out how other fraternity sys-
tems work and what changes
have been needed or made in
the various systems.

However, Jackson stated that
the committee is primarily in-
terested in the situation as it
is here and now. and although
the questionnaires sent to past
leaders and students and other
schools will be helpful, the
main emphasis will be placed
on information concerning the
present situation at Davidson.
The committee has interviewed
and plans to continue to inter-
view members of the current
student body, faculty, and ad-
ministration in order to learn
their views and suggestions. All
of the committee findings will
be cited in the report.

The executive secretaries of

each of the national fraternities
represented on this campus have
been contacted by the commit-
tee, and asked if they would be
willing to come to the campus
and be interviewed by the com-
mittee. The response has not
been too encouraging Jackson
commented, but he hopes that
several executive secretaries
will visit Davidson.

Each fraternity president has
been asked by the fraternity
evaluators to lead a discussion
in his fraternity concerning the
value of the national fraternity
to the chapter. After such a
discussion at a fraternity meet-
ing, the fraternity president
will write up a brief report for
the committee stating what the
genera! consensus of the chapter
is concerning the national or-
ganization, what the fraternity
gets out of natiohal affiliation,
and what financial obligation
the chapter has to the national
organization.

Jackson concluded his state-
ments to THE DAVIDISONIAN
by commenting that the fratern-
ity situation at Davidson is a
unique one. due to the isolation.
small size. all mate student
body and other factors. There-
fore. he proposed that any solu-
tions will probably have to be
unique also. He emphasized that
the committee is trying to open
several areas for consideration.
and is basing its recommenda- *
tions on information received
from all interested parties in-
volved in the question — those
satisfied with the current situa-
tion, those dissatisfied with the
situation, and those who see a
need for some changes in the
present set-up.

Re-emphasizing the complex-
ity of the problem, Jackson stat-
ed that the committee does not
want it to be thought that their
report will be a complete
answer to the problems. How-
ever. the committee hopes to
offer some concrete recommen-
dations based on their findings.
Jackson expressed the hope of
the committee that the report
will be given consideration by
all involved in the problem.

Following the report the com-
mittee will continue to meet and
explore the problem even more
thoroughly.
