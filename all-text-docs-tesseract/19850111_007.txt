Film Festival Captures Foreign Culture, People

By CRAIG DETWEILER

- Foreign Films. The mere mention of |
the words strikes fear and confusion into
the hearts of almost all Americans. Stan-
dard adjectives for motion pictures like
“flash,” “entertaining,” and “enjoyable”
are replaced by “weird,” “unintelligi-
ble,” and “stupid.” The Union Fine Film
Committee, risking financial security
and campus wide reputation, has sched-
uled a foreign film festival running Janu-
ary 14-19.

Before running to the exit at the first
sight of a caption, consider the rich inter-
national productions available next
week. Two of the four films warranted
recognition in Sight and Sound’ s interna-
tional critics poll of the ten best movies
of all time. We’re not dealing in best of
the year, but best ever. Care to argue
with snooty, high brow critics? Then
consider the heartfelt, innovative stories
offered within the series.

Forgoing the wham-bang, splish-
splash, warp-speed mentality of typical
Hollywood fare, these creations of Fr-
ance, Germany, and Japan focus on a
vanishing subject — the human condi-
tion. Each film offers a glimpse of its cul-
ture, its people, and its values. The “for-
eign” enables the audience to relate to
universal truths about the game of love,
the abuse of women, the trials of youth,
the darkness of the heart, the hope of
dreams and the problem of judgment.
The alien and foreign begins to appear
vaguely familiar once an honest, open
mind has been brought to the theatre. I
invite you to investigate the foreign film
festival. Bring glasses for the captions,

the international characters. To lessen the
cultural gap, brief capsule previews will
provide necessary background.

Jean Renoir’s La Regle du jeu, or
Rules of the Game offers a humorous,
penetrating look at social interaction be-
tween classes. The complexities and
trials created by love between the aristoc-
racy and the bourgeois mirror the ten-
sions of pre-war France. Made in 1939,
Renoir’s film captures the tense mood of
a society about to be torn apart by another
world war. While dealing with contem-
porary subject matter, Renoir turns to
baroque music and classical French com-
edy for his inspiration. The Rules of the
Game entertains and challenges the vie-
wer, embodying a people, a time, and a
universal problem.

Tuesday.’s film, Kenji Mizoguchi’s
Ugetsu Monogatari, shares the top ten
accolades of La Regle du jeu. Presented
in 1953, Ugetsu focuses upon the gnaw-
ing yearnings of Japanese men, caught
between the rising work ethic and the
fading samurai tradition. Behind the
struggling male egos lie Japanese women
desperate for attention and respect within
their culture. Ugetsu, a simple 16th cen-
tury potter, encounters a passionate and a
drab aspect of Japanese culture, ulti-
mately finding both to be a dream. From
a country absorbed by the elusive Ameri-
can Dream, Ugetsu speaks to all peoples’
aspirations and failures.

Fritz Lang’s German classic, M,
treats a more traditional cinematic sub-
ject, murder, in grand, eerie style. Star-
ring the quirky, bug-eyéd Peter Lorre as
a child murderer, M examines the sick-
ness behind the criminal mind and the

fresh eyes for the images, and heart for

sickness created by human judgment.
Tension mounts throughout the picture
as underground vigilantes seek to outdis-
tance the police in tracking the murderer
‘marked by an “M” on his coat. Lang con-
centrates upon showwing rather than tel-
ling his audience what’s occurring onsc-
reen. Exploiting the full potential of a vi-
sual medium, Lang focuses up on
Lorre’s haunted looks, the setting’s dis-
quieting atmosphere, and the camera’s
ability to exaggerate images. A power-
ful, jarring film results.

After a Monday through Wednesday
bonanza, the Fine Film Festival con-
cludes Saturday with Francois Truffaut’ $
homage to his youth, The 400 Blows.
Like the other directors, Truffaut. ad-
vances filmmaking through innovative
technique and heartfelt characterization.
Truffaut uses The 400 Blows to introduce
Antoine Doinel, a semi-autobiographical
figure who reappears in subsequent Truf-
faut works. Scenes of Antoine’s Parisian
home, neglecting parents, and neighbor-

hood school educate the viewer about the
hero.

When Antoine eventually resorts to
petty crimes, the audience sympathizes
with the boy’s plight. Truffaut creates a
heartwarming valentine to lost innocence
and painful maturation. The 400 Blows
concludes the festival with a quiet, pas-
sionate examinatoin of the hu condi-
tion, destined to draw both laughter and
tears from the audience.

Regardless of one’s prejudices about
the purpose of cinema, the four fine for-
eign films screening next week demand
serious, thoughtful attention. Vicwers
who dare to face the challenge of reading
captions or listening to dubbed voices
will find rich cinematic treasure. Take a
risk, check out a flick. You'll find
heartwarming drama, light comedy, and
tough questions coming from the screen.
Whatever your conclusions, you'll be
glad to join the select few who've dared
to confront and conquer their Fear of For-
eign Films.

Gorky Park: Intense Drama

By MATT MORRIS

Gorky Park, this week’s Pop Film,
has the rare distinction of being a novel-
into-movie that transcends the piece of
literature upon which it is based. Martin

z Smith’s engrossing if ultimately
empty story of murder behind the iron
curtain left the reader with an unsatisfy-
ing conclusion and plenty of questions.

The plot concerned Arkady, a deter-
mined Russian policeman, and his inves-
tigations into a particularly grotesque
murder in Moscow’s infamous Gorky
Park. As the novel unwound, the well-in-

. tentioned Arkady found himself trapped

in a Kremlin conspiracy where his honor-
able methods of detection mean nothing
in the face of corrupt government. The
book ended with Arkady unable to
triumph over the evil KGB or his own re-
stlessness. An unsettling conclusion if
there ever was one, and Smith unfortu-
nately gave his hero no release, no form
of protest and the novel remains not pro-
found but stuporous and tired.

Director Michael Apted (Coal
Miner's Daughter), one of our most effi-
cient and reliable artists working today
(and one of the most underrated) ties his
Gorky Park up in a sly, mystical knot
giving the film’s premise meat and
meaning. And where the plot muddles
(the first hour has some rough sledding)
Apted saves the day through the power of
sheer momentum. There is a murder, an
investigation and a coverup, all told with

such energy that you know you're in for
quite a ride from the first frame.

Opening with a deceptively pictures-
que view of ice skating in Gorky Park
(shot from a dizzyingly low level), the
film’s first few sequences hint at the in-
tense drama that lies ahead. Apted keeps
the movie zinging, all the while probing
and poking at the Russian government's
less-than-perfect methods of operation.
Gorky Park — the film — is a tale of
double agents and double entendre that at
times reaches almost Shakespearean
heights (complete with complex charac-
ters and situations). With William Hurt
in the lead role of Arkady, battling the
evil and cynical-as-ever Lee Marvin, the
film absorbs the viewer like few others of
this genre.

Fitting perfectly into this steam en-
gine of a movie, Hurt, an intelligent guy
great at playing intelligent guys, captures
Smith's Arkady in a wonderfully under-
stated way; his portrayal is straightfor-
ward and honest. Sure, it was a little
crazy casting Hurt as a Russian law en-
forcer, but you quickly forget he’s from
New Jersey and quickly remember what

- areliable performer he’s been in the past

few years. And Lee Marvin hasn't had a
role as tasty as this since Point Blank.
Watching him menace others, oozing
slime through those dark sheep dog eyes,
Marvin seems to be having the time of his
life. And what's the saying, the better the
villain the better the movie? Both are
splendid.
