SGA votes to elect ATC officers, trustee representatives

By Mary Crare JALONICK
Executive Editor

The SGA voted Tuesday to
elect the Activities Tax Council
Vice Chair and the students who
serve on Trustee Committees. In
the past the SGA president has
appointed students to fill these

positions.

The Activities Tax Council,
which allocates funding to all stu-
dent organizations that request it,
is chaired by a student for a calen-
dar year. Junior Patricia Evans has
served as Vice Chair for the last
year under Rebekah Peeples and
will head up the committee for

1997. The elected student will
become chair for 1998.

Those elected to trustee com-
mittees will begin their tenure in
April. Students sit on the build-
ings and grounds, admissions and
financial aid, athletic policy, and
institutional advancement commit-
tees.

The SGA also voted to elect a

treasurer each year. The position |

will be non-voting, but paid. This
person will maintain financial
records of the SGA and cosign all
checks or funds from the SGA
treasury.

In addition, they voted that
four students should be elected to

the CCRL instead of three.

SGA president Warren Buford
feels that election to these posi-
tions will help students to learn
more about what committees are
doing on campus. “We are trying
to give students a little more power
and response.” he says. “These
positions are important.”

Cosmic keeps coffee coming after short winter hiatus

Despite rumors that the estab-
lishment had closed its doors for
good at the end of December, Cos-
mic Coffee House, located on Main
Street in Davidson, is alive and
well and open daily for business.

Cosmic Coffee House owner

Nancy Gray relates that the busi- .

ness was simply on holiday hiatus
from December 20 through Janu-
ary 6, notification of which was
posted on the front door of the
Main Street eatery.

According to Gray, the hiatus

provided time for the seasonal shut-
down of her other Cosmic Coffee
House in Blowing Rock, North
Carolina. However, the Blowing
Rock Cosmic Coffee House will
not reopen again this spring. Cos-
mic Coffee House’s ownership has
instead chosen to concentrate its
full efforts on servicing the
Davidson community of which it
has been a part for just over a year.

. While town residents and
members of Davidson College’s
faculty and staff have provided
Cosmic Coffee House with a solid
customer base, Gray says she is
continually searching for ways to

entice more students to patronize

her establishment on a regular ba- —

sis. “We are really quite discour-
aged that only about 1% of the
student body comes here daily,”
says Gray.

Gray says that a chief part of
the rationale for locating the Cos-
mic Coffee House in Davidson was
that the small, close-knit campus
community would provide the per-
fect setting for a mutually benefi-
cial relationship to thrive.

“We are always pleased to
host functions and activities that
arise out of student or faculty ini-
tiative,” says Gray.

SGA allocates self
5% increase in budget

By Mary Care JALONICK
Executive Editor

In a vote this Tuesday, the
SGA decided to give itself an auto-
matic 5% of Activities Tax Coun-
cil Funding each year.

This move gives the SGA a
considerable raise.

Last year, they requested 4.4%
of the total budget of $292,305 and
received $11,750, or around 4%.

Five percent of this budget
would be $14,615.25 — a raise in
funding of $2,865.25.

The increase will be higher
should the total amount allocated
rise as it traditionally has.

President Warren Buford says
that this move is needed to “so-
lidify the link between the SGA

and the ATC.”

The ATC is a committee of
the SGA, but the SGA has tradi-
tionally had to petition for funds
from the ATC. Buford feels that
this current procedure leaves room
for the SGA to “strongarm” the
ATCinto giving them higher fund-
ing each year.

With the change, he feels, the
SGA will have an automatic per-
centage and petitioning will not be
necessary.

Buford says that the new ad-.
ministration will be responsible for
allocating these new funds, but
hopes that they will go toward plan-
ning SGA events, giving non-
funded organizations: money for
special projects, and, most impor-
tantly, support for a rides program.
