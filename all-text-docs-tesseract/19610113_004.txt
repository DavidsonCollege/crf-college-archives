SENIORS DAVIO ALASRAN AND HUGH BARGER work with
the infra-red spectro-photometer in Dr. J. G. Martin‘s office
in the Martin Science Buitding. The new experimental equip-

ment was made possible by a

grant to Davidson College by

Research Corporation, a foundation which provides means for

scientific investigation.

Jj. G@. Martin Awarded
Grant For Research

A new grant to aid scientific research has been
awarded to Davidson College by Research Corporation, a!
science foundation. Dr. James G. Martin, assistant pro-| sme company each year and
fessor of chemistry, recently received a $3,600 grant to auch of the Y onfusion of hav-
study the “Conformational Stability of 2,2,6,6,-Tetra-|ing an absent person in charge

The grant has made possible

the purchase. of an infra-red
spectro-photometer which Mar-
tin will use in his research.

Seniors David Alaoran and
Hugh Barger are now work-
ing with Martin on the re-
search project.

According to Martin. Research
Corporation specializes in help-
ing people who are just start-
ing professional teaching. Mar-
tin, a graduate of Davidson in
1957, joined the Chemistry De-
partment this semester after
fulfilling the requirements for

his Doctor of Chemistry degree |

at Princeton in 1960.

A recent release from the
foundation states that “unre-

_ More than 65. colleges and

universities in 32 states have

also ‘received recent Research

Corporation grants amounting

to approximately $400,000. A

totel of 95 individual grants

have been announced by the
foundetion for fundamental
scientific studies at institu-
tions in Canada, Panama,

Haiti, and India as well as the

United States.

Twenty of the current grants
are unrestricted, and the re
mainder were awarded for spe-
cific research projects in the
natural sciences.

The foundation was establish-
ed in 1912 by the American in-
ventor-teacher-scientist, Fred-
erick Gardner Cottrell. About
$15 million in subsequent
grants have aided the research |
of some 3,000 scientists.

Research Corporation also ad-

Fate Of Handbook
Remains Uncertain

The Publications Board is
awaiting action by the Student
Council on making The Wildcat
Handbook a student body pub-
lication. The YMCA terminated
its sponsorship of the publica-
tion last week.

The Student Council has yet
to make certain constitutional
changes necessary for the turn-
over of the ‘handbook, Certain
mechanical problems, especially
that of how to select an editor |
for the publication, still huve ;
not been worked out. |

The Publications Board plans
to meet right after exam period
to start working on the plans
for content and publication.
provided the Student Council !
action has been taken by that
time.

Tentative plans for the op-
eration of the handbook include
setting up a  student-faculty
committee, including a Student
Council member, a representa-
tive of the dean’s office, and
a person from the Y, to handle
the publication.

There is also a proposal that
the publication be placed
largely in administration hands
when the’ editor leaves for the
summer. In this way the actual
printing can be handled by the

The Student-Faculty Confer-

Schnewlin: Switzerland

Is

Land Of Peaceful Stability

By UVELI SCHNEWLIN
Richardson Scholar
I am not surprised that all Americans who have been
to Switzerland are impressed with its beauty. I myself
admire the scenery of many regions again and again when
I go out for mountain-climbing and ski-ing.

But I think that the Swiss
can be proud of their country
for other reasons. Since the 13th
century Switzerland has devel-
oped into a small country that
can stand on its own and has
given an example for peaceful

| stability.

22 CANTONS

The area of Switzerland is
16,000 square miles, divided into
22 cantons populated by about
five million people. There are
three main geographical parts:
the Jura (a mountain range in
the West), the hilly midlands
with woods and lakes, and the
Alps.

Just as the regions are va-
ried, so are the people. It seems
to me that it is characteristic
for Switzerland to bring all dif-

Forgotten Formal Shirt:
Who’s Wearing It Now ?

By ED RUDERT

Davidsonian Feature Writer

The Davidson College Laundry will sell you the shirt off your friend's back.
Just mention your size, and the laundry will sell you a neatly-wrapped white forma:

shirt for less than the cost of having a suit cleaned. If you forgot to

ick up your

dress shirt the last time you had it laundered, anybody in town might be wearing it”

now.

Few people in the college
community know anything about
this sideline business. Actual-
ly the enterprise is intended to
alleviate a bothersome situation
brought on by students them-
selves.

“i'd almost gve them away
to get rid of them,” said

Laundry Maenager Cc. W.
Stacks about the stacks of tux

shirts he has secumulated

during the past few years.

“These are shirts that have
been left here by boys who are-
n't here anymore. We used to
charge 25 cents extra to laun-
der those shirts because they
took more work and had to be
packaged separately.

and leave_them at the laundry
till they needed them again.
Then they would forget about
them until after they had gone
on from school. We were stuck
with the shirts.

“About four years ago,’ he
continued, “when Sam Spen-
cer was dean of students, |!
talked to him about it, and
he wrote about 75 former
students asking them where
we could send their shirts.
I think we heard from about
three of them.”

Stacks walked over to the
place where the shirts are bun-
dled up according to neck and
sleeve sizes. At first estimating
the number of shirts to be 50

dics and said, “No, there must
be at least 150 here.

“I've been selling these shirts
for a dollar to anybody that
wants them, but I'll be willing
to cut them down to 50 cents if
it'll help get rid of them now
that more people are going te
know about them.

“All of these shirts have
been here at least two years,
some of them four or five,
but a lot of them are shirts
that haven't been worn and

laundered but once,’ he said,

looked brand new except for
the starch.

WIDE RANGES

Besides such superficial dif-
ferences there are wide ranges
of political attitudes, ways of
life, and social levels. Yet the‘
feeling of being Swiss prevails
in all these things.

The so-called living standard
of Switzerland is high in spite
of the fact that the country has
almost no natural resources of
raw materials, which have to
be imported as well as a good
deal of the food.

NEUTRALITY

The Swiss Constitution is
democratic and has much in
common with the one of the
United States. But our foreign
policy is directed by strict neu-
trality (which does not mean
that people are neutral in their
opinions!) A relatively strong
militia army makes it an armed
neutrality, which watches over
the inviolability of Swiss terri-
tory.

“IT’S HERE-IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR IT”

Even before Ron Spetrino received his engi-
neering degree from Case he had good job offers
from six companies.

He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone Company
—his reason: “‘I was convinced an engineer could
go further here—if he was willing to work for it.”

As soon as Ron got his feet on the ground
in telephone engineering, he was tapped for a
tough assignment. The job—to engineer switch-
ing equipment modifications needed to prepare
Cleveland for nationwide customer dialing of long
distance calls.

Ron wrapped it up in five months, and found
he had earned a shot at another tough assignment.
In this job Ron helped engineer a completely new
long distance switching center for Cleveland. This
switching center connected Cleveland with the
nationwide customer dialing network. It was
about a year later that Ron put the finishing

can possibly find.”

Faspsnice R. Karret, President
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project.

Today, as a Supervising Engineer, Ron heads
a staff of five engineers and is responsible for
telephone switching in much of the greater
Cleveland area.

He supervises the design and purchase of $3
million worth of equipment a year. And even
more important, he is charged with developing
the technical and managerial skills of his staff.

Ron knows what he’s talking about when he
says, ‘In this business you have to do more than
a good job. We expect a man to be a self-developer.
We expect him to take responsibility from his
first day on the job and think for himself. You
don’t get ahead around here by just doing time.”

If you want @ job in which you're given every
chance to prove yourself, and real responsibility
right from the start—you'll want to see your Place-
ment Office for further information.
