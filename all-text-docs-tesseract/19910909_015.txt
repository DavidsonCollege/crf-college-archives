Thomas Likes Emphasis on Teaching

By May Martin
Dr. Harry Thomas, a new pro-
fessor in the English Department,

hasenjoyed seeing studentsaround _ prised by many aspects of south-
campus and getting: to know them
better, which was less common at

ern culture, he has been im-
pressed by Davidson, and is

is happy to teach at a college that
expects its teaches to
teach. After teaching at
Boston University for
seven years, he says
that he and his family
were glad to leave both °
the city and the'univer- ©
sity, and to come to a
place where professors
arenotexpectedtogive |
the “back’ of their left’ jus
hands to teaching and
the palm of the right to
writing and research.”

Thomas, who went Dr. Thomas, papers in hand, is ready for Davidson

to University of San

Diego and then to the University of
Michigan for graduated school,
heard ravings of Davidson and
North Carolina from a friend in
graduate school. He also knew
Charles Wright, an American poet
who attended Davidson.

As far as Davidson students
are concerned, Thomas has found
that on the average, they are better
writers than Boston University
students, although they do not

speak up in class as much. Thomas '

Boston.

Thomas is teaching three
courses this semester: a seminar
on the poetry of Thomas Hardy,
Philip Larkin, and Tony Harrison,
a poet he thought not many
Davidsonians would know. As it
turns out, Thomas found that some
here have heard of him and know
his work well. He is also teaching
a Freshman Composition section,
which he is enjoying, and English
160, a British literature survey.

them with tar late at night (the
sophomores didn’t make the fresh-
men jump out the second floor
windows to escape), or beating
them with sticks and pokers might
seem extremé, but these were ex-
tenuating circumstances. The
Freshman class of 1906, at the time
the largest in Davidson’s history,
outnumbered the sophomores
almost two to one: This outbreak
of hazing seemed to be a haphaz-
ard exertion of authority by the
sophomore class who were intimi-
dated by the Freshmen’s numbers
but refused to show it.

The freshmen found little tol-
erance for these unwarranted
pranks and decided to give the
sophomoresa reason to haze them.
After all, if you are going to be
punished, why not do something
wrong?

Painting the 12-9 freshman-
sophomore baseball score on
Davidson’s fence (some sources
say the pillars of Chambers) was
definitely something wrong, Fur-
thermore, roping (some say greas-
ing as well) the gate to the Banquet
Hall where the sophomores were
feasting waseven worse. And while
they still felt the sting of shame,
like a slap of a glove across the
face, the sophomores marched en
masse to mete out their revenge.

The force of sophomores meta

_ ets of water, rocks, and sticks bar-:
ricaded in Spence House [a house
on Main Street]. Here the details
are fuzzy. One says that the fresh-

men threatened to fire pistols if _

any sophomore breached the stair-
case, Another writes that the sopho-
mores hurled stones and threat-
ened to burn down the house (and
later rebuild it). Still another says
that the sophomores and the fresh-
men simply found themselves at a
draw, kind of like'the Cold War,

Regardless of the degree of
violence, a compromise was
reached. The terms of the truce
vary with who tells the tale, but the
end result was that neither the

hazing nor.the retaliations ceased. .

The day after, the freshman
class decided to leave Davidson
College until everything blew over.
All butthree who lived in Davidson
walked to the Cornelius train sta-
tion. There, they pooled together
their money, bought tickets to
Charlotte, sang. the Alma Mater,
and awaited their train.

Then, like the cavalry in the
Westerns, came professors from
the College. They pleaded and
begged the freshmen to return to
Davidson. The professors offered
the class their own houses, and
one, Dr. Martin, threatened to shoot
any sophomore who touched a
freshman, The freshmen walked
back to the College.

The next day the student body
informed the freshmen that they
had until 2:00 to repaint the fence
that bore the 12-9 score. The fresh-
menrefused. The faculty entreated.
The seniors, juniors, and sopho-
mores waited. President Smith
implored. The freshmen refused.
Time ticked. President Smith
looked for any freshman to rub out
the score. None volunteered. The
freshmen collected in Dr. Martin’s

‘yard. The seniors, juniors, and

sophomores stopped waiting. They
held a meeting. And much to the
disappointment of any violence-
seeking reader, the upperclassmen
voted not to attack the freshmen.

Meetings were held, and com-
promises were agreed upon and
followed. The next day President
Smith granted Davidson College a
vacation. The upperclassmen wel-
comed back the freshmen with
cheers, and the freshmen responded
with the College yell.

He has found that there is
much less diversity in North
Carolina than in a large north-
eastern city, and thus the culture
here is “entirely different.”

Culture shock has not yet
passed, but Thomas is happy
here. Quoting John Reed, he said
that he has “‘seen the future and it

is extremely concerned with giv-

community. On asmall homoge-

Davidson’s, intolerance can eas-

this is the case with the homosex-

CoMA wants to do its utmost to
increase the representation of this
