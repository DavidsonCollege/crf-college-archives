Harry Shearer, Paul Shaffer, and Rob
Reiner. Directed by Rob Reiner. *** ]/2*

Motley Crue, Def Leppard, AC/DC,
Iron Maiden, Quiet Riot, Black Sabbath
— if you harbor any feelings about these
heavy- metal bands, then This is Spinal
Tap demands to be seen. If you espe-
cially find a real humor in the absurdity
of grown men brandishing shorts,
leather, Druid costumes, or Satanic sym-
bols onstage, then Spinal Tap is for you.
Rob Reiner’s Spinal Tap does not settle
for mere satirization but serious abuse of
ithe hard rock music genre. By tracing the
itials of an aging British band, Spinal
Tap, Reiner, and company provide a
penetrating and entertaining study of a
curious subject — heavy-metal bands.

Amid lame Hollywood “comedies,” Spi-
nal Tap offers intelligence, verve, and
hilarity. It’s a real treat.

This is Spinal Tap documents the
comeback tour of a washed up, hard-rock
group. Spinal Tap tours to promote its
new album, Smell the Glove. From the
initial disagreement over the album
cover (scheduled to picture a naked,
greased woman clad with a dog collar
smelling a glove, it comes out solid black
instead), Spinal Tap zips through one
discouraging, humorous event after
another in the band’s demise.

Composed of Englishmen with
names like Derek and Ian, Spinal Tap
tries hard to impress and express raw
emotion and anger onstage, but the tri-
vial backstage interviews undercut their
“artistry.”

Director Rob Reiner portrays the fic-

Spinal Tap: Absurdist, Hilarious Filmmaking

tional filmmaker Marty Diberghi, a man
determined to discover the truth about
rock and roll. Diberghi asks probing
questions that reveal Spinal Tap’s roots.
He finds that Spinal Tap has gone
through over 30 drummers because they
traditionally die by spontaneously com-
busting onstage. The band admits that
one drummer died by choking on vomit
determined not to be his own.

Clips from old television appear-
ances show Spinal Tap’s early days, as a
Beatles rip-off and later a psychedelic
“groovy love” band. The black and white
Beatles segment and_ kaleidoscope
psychedelia shots evoke genuine and
silly period flavor. Diberghi enables his
audience to understand what makes Spi-
nal Tap the absolute critical and popular
failure they are today.

The dramatic concert footage
supplies the film’s most hilarious mo-
ments. Singing songs like “Sex Farm,”
Spinal Tap exhibits its aging, faded per-
formance prowess. Props intended to
overwhelm the audience end up dominat-
ing the band. Cacoons, scheduled to
open when the music begins, traps the
terrified bass player. While the
stagehands use crow bars, hammers, and
blowtorches to free him for his solo, Spi-
nal Tap plays on. When the lead guitarist
bends over backwards for his standard,
excruciating solo, he literally bends over
backwards. Roadies must pick the
guitarist and the guitar off the ground.

The final hilarious blow comes when
an 18-foot Stonehenge prop shrinks to
smaller proportions than the group de-

mands. Management and artistic differ- .

ences leave the band shorthanded, and a

spontaneous free-form jazz sound is sub-
stituted: absurdist, hilarious filmmaking.

This is Spinal Tap succeeds in every
frame of every scene because of the abso-
lute seriousness of performers and the di-
rector on screen. Reiner brings a revolt-
ing ernestness to his role as DeBerghi
that forces the viewer to laugh at him.
Spinal Tap’s principal members are por-
trayed by Michael McKean (Lenny of
“Laveme and Shirley”) and two current
“Saturday Night Live” cast members,
Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer.
Adopting staunch British accents and
tangled hair, McKean, Guest, and
Shearer manage to keep straight faces
throughout their ridiculous statements
and songs. Spinal Tap works because the
performers act as serious about their
“music” as real bands like AC/DC and
the Scorpions often attempt. Reiner’s di-
rection and script allow McKean and
company simply to ramble with their
ludicrous characters.

As Derek St. Simons, McKeon does
a miraculous job of retaining a biank ex-
pression, angry stare, and harmless brain
throughout the 90 roaring minutes.

The look, the feel, and the sound of
Spinal Tap are strikingly accurate.
Reiner and his cast display an obvious
understanding and mastery of the heavy-
metal genre. They know how bored
British rockers talk, act, and think. Tack-
ling a subject primed for satire, Reiner,
Guest, McKean, and Shearer absolutely
abuse the most popular bands in one of
music’s most popular, lamentable forms.
This is Spinal Tap is a lethal comedy. It’s
arare, witty film that deserves to be seen,
loved, and d praised.
