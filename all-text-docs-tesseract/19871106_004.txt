Kuykendall seeks a Savidson
“servanthood” philosophy

Service graduation requirement discussed

By SUSAN PEARSALL

In an attempt to examine the
role of service at Davidson, Col-
lege President Dr. John Kuyken-
dall has appointed a Service Task
Force of students, faculty, and
administrators, whose duties he
outlined in a forum resembling a

—pressconference Tuesday, Oct.27— quirement for graduation and the —

in the 900 Room. Sub-groups of
the twenty-member task force
will write a philosophy of service,
publicize the work of service or-
ganizations on campus, explore

new avenues of service, and write
a report to the president of the
college and the trustees to be
submitted in May 1988.
Kuykendall also. raised ques-
tions about the college’s estima-
tion of the importance of service
because it could become a re-

granting of tenure. Would a cur-

‘ricular or non-curricular require-

ment in this area defeat the pur-

pose of volunteerism? Many of |

the students present argued that

Yr

such a requirement would be
philosophically repugnant.

Kuykendall expressed hopes
that the committee’s work will
resultina philosophical statement
defining Davidson’s goals as an
institution in this area. He also
expects the committee to address
the question of possible rewards
for the college and community
which would result from a height-
ened commitment to serve.

Kuykendall explained that the
ultimate goal of the committee is

Honor Council holds open forum

Problems with self- scheduled exams cited

By GEORGE KURANI

Representatives of the Honor
Council met this Tuesday to speak
with and answer questions from a
crowd of about twenty students
and faculty members. While there
were no pre-determined topics for
discussion, the meeting lasted
about an hour and dealt with some
of the questions that have been
and are presently of great impor-
tance to the Honor Council.

The first question dealt with
recent rumors that have hinted at
elimination of student-run self-
scheduled exams. Inresponse toa
student’s concern about such a
possibility, the Honor Council
responded by saying that there has

_ been an “unusually high” number
of suspected violations over the
last few terms at the college; par-
ticularly with exams. The solu-
tion proposed by the Council in-
volved encouraging students to
take a more active role in report-
ing any suspicions -- even if it
meant calling for more students to
apporach friends who they think
may be guilty of Honor Code
violations.

Later discussion. was pee
nated by a single, pressing ques-
tion: why is there a perception that
students are not taking the Honor
Code seriously enough? .

Several factors were mentioned

and debated. Some suggested that
professors might help by taking
extra time, particularly at the
beginning of the term, to stress

+‘their belief in the Honor Code and

in the value of Honor.

‘One professor present at the
discussion noted that in his time
spent as a Davidson —under-
graduate student, promotion of
the Honor Code was left to stu-
dents since students. were also
required to implement and to en-
force it. In those days, he said, the
faculty had very little to do with

‘the promotion of the Honor Code
_ tothestudent body. He also added

that he was not sure if it should
become the job of professors to
lecture to their students on the
subject of the Honor Code.

It was suggested that students’
attitudes may be shifting because
more students are spending aterm
or a year abroad in environments
that do not value honor as highly
as does the Davidson college
community. “But what about the
time students spend away from
Davidson during the summer?”
others countered. “Should that
‘affect their sense of honor, too?”
Many of the people attending the
forum did not feel that spending
time away from Davidson should
lead a student away from the
Honor Code.

It was also suggested that the
recent increases in the number of
Honor Code violations might be
symptomatic of greater ills affect-
ing all of society. Has our culture
fostered and “Ivan Boesky” men-
tality among Davidson’s students,
and if so, is it destroying
Davidson’s sense of honor?

Students also suggested solu-
tions to the problems which the
Honor Council has faced recently.
It was proposed that the Coucil
place more emphasis upon the
positive aspects of the Honor
Code than upon the Code’s nega-
tive, threatening side. Perhaps
more should be done to promote a
feeling of mutual trust instead of
just warning students of the conse-
quences they would face if they
violated the rules?

One student said that he felt that
the Honor Code has come to rep-
resent nothing more than a series
of threats to individuals instead of

to help the trustees make a policy
on service through their research
of the issue. “Commitment to
service is a distinctive character-
istic of this campus,” he stated,
and is “a very basic aspect of what
I think Davidson is all about.”
When he became president three
years ago, Kuykendall said, he
defined the college in terms of its
qualities of Scholarship and Ser-
vanthood. Therefore, he said, he
formed this task force in order to
assist the trustees in fulfilling two
objectives in the area of Servan-
thood: to make Davidson out-
standing in its commitment to
service, and to make the student
body more aware of and involved
in a greater variety of community
- projects.

Throughout the school year, the
committee members will be
working to fulfill four main du-
ties. First of all, they will make an
inventory of all individual and
group-oriented service projects
undertaken here by students, fac-
ulty and staff members.

A survey is currently being pre-
pared to begin work on this task.

Next, they plan to survey other
institutions, especially those simi-
lar to Davidson in size, and com-
pare their service activities to
ours. From this evidence, they
will come up with some recom-
mendations for improvement,.
and, finally, suggest new possi-
bilities for service locally, in the
Charlotte area, and abroad.

Friday, November 6, 1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Perhaps the most pertinent and
interesting questions on the topic
of service were raised by longtime
Y-Student Service Corps Advisor
Dr. David Shi. He suggested that
a solution to the problems in this

- area would be the hiring of a full-

time staff member to coordinate
all-activities and to advise and
recruit interested students.

Since service usually involves
ongoing projects, it has been diffi-
cult for the YSSC to work up to its
full potential because each year
brings a change of membership,
and the new students often need
assistance in learning the ropes. A
staff member could bring a real,
elementof continuity to the group’
by passing along his knowledge of
each project. In addition, he
would be able to respond to the
needs of the Charlotte community
by keeping in contact with their
service organizations and allocat-
ing students to aid them in their
efforts.

Other decisions which the trus-
tees may have to make involve
money, naturally. The school will
probably end upspending more on
service projects.

Shi suggested purchasing a van
to transport students to problem
spots outside the Davidson area.

In any case, service at Davidson
will undergo a complete reexami-
nation within the next two terms,
and the results may be released as
soon as 1988.

and dignity. He expressed his
feeling that daily reminders of the
omnipresence of the Honor Sys-
tem (such as the inclusion of the
Honor Pledge at the top of every
College Union Announcement
Sheet) serve only as a “bitter
threat” to students instead of rein-
forcing the principles of the Honor
System.

cuts $7.5 million from
Davidson endowment

Conservative investment saved college
from even greater loss —

By RACHEL NATION

On Monday, October 19, stocks
plunged; panic gripped the inves-
tors on Wall Street, and America
experienced its biggest stock
market crash in 73 years. Fortu-
nately, however, Davidson’s en-
dowment only dropped 13%. In
fact, Bob Sutton, Vice President
of Business and Finance, assured
the Davidson community that
Davidson’s investment policy is
structured to deal with stock mar-
ket fluctuations.

Just how much have the ripples
of this crash extended to affect the
finances of Davidson College?
According to Burton Hudson,
Director of Financial Planning,
Davidson’s endowment of $66.9
million decreased 13% to $59.4
million. This figure equals the
value of the college’s endowment
in July 1986.

Hudson explained that the
Budget and Finance committee, a
subcommittee of the Board of

Trustees, has hired five different
external managers, located across
the country, each of whom has.a
different investment style for di-
versification. Thus, Davidson’s
cndoweche assets are spread out
between stocks, bonds, cash, real
estate, and venture capital.

Most colleges invest from 50%
to 60% of their endowments in
stocks. Therefore, according to
Hudson, “we’re at the low end of
equity exposure,” since Davidson
has invested only 48% of its en-
dowment in stocks. Hudson
added that Davidson had actually
been moving away from stocks as
the crash approached, He also
said that the plans for new dormi-
tories and the Baker sports com-
plex will not be affected by the
endowment drop since the funds
for these Projects have yet to be
collected. According to Sutton,
the drop in endowment funds has,

“set us back to about where we
were at the beginning of the year.”
