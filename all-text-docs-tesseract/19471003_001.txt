‘Y' Ride Board

Y.M.C.A, Facility

This is to remind all students
that the Y.M.C.A. Ride Board is
in the lobby of Chambers again
this year to help anyone who
wants a ride, or wants to offer
a ride to some one else. This
board is a portion of one of the
bulletin boards in the lobby of
Chambers. It is marked off and
labelled “Y.M.C.A. Ride Board.”
In using this board all you have
to do is write a notice telling
where you are going or where
you would like to go and pin it
up on the bulletin board. It
helps, when making such a no-
tice, if you will give your room
number so the person who may
be able to help you will know
how to get in touch with you.

Credits In English
For Journalistic Work

This year, for the first time, the
English Davidson
has decided to give extra credit in
English those students who
have articles published either
THE DAVIDSONIAN or ., the
SCRIPTS AND PRANKS.

Professor Lilly, the head of the
English Department, says that
this policy has been considered sev-
eral times before, but this is the
first year that it will. go into ef-
fect. The adoption of this” policy
was brought about by the reali-
zation that work done in connec-
tion with these publications
was equally as important as that

done in the classroom.

The editors in chief of both pub-
lications will keep a record of the
contributions made. This record,
together with the editor's opinion
of the value of the article will be
submitted to the various English
professors where .a final grading
will take place. In the final grad-
ing procedure, although he care-
fully considers the report, the pro-
fessor is at all times at liberty to
disagree with. the editor’s opinion.
