THE BUBBLE BURST?

This Monday the soccer team absorbed their first
defeat of the season at the hands of North Carolina State.
For many this was the end of a dream—that of national
recognition for Davidson. Yet, the whole matter of nation-
al recognition for soccer is a rather vague and little
known process.

Due to the expanding interest in soccer among col-
leges in the country, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association has expanded the national championship
soccer tournament into a sixteen-team affair.

The teams that make up this tournament are select-
ed by a National Selections Committee on the basis of
season records. Two teams are selected from each of the
country’s six divisions (including the South) along with
four at-large entries to complete the field. These selec-'
tions are based upon a complicated point-rating system |
computed by wins and losses and the rating of the op-
ponent. In the first round of the national to be played

etween November 21 and 25, the two regional selections ;
are paired against one another and the at-large teams|
matched. The eight winners then advance to the regionals. |
In the Regionals the Southern winner would play the Mid-
Atlantic winner; at the same time other regional winners, |
and the other regional winners and the two at-large win-'
ners would vie against one another. The four winners

of the regionals would then advance to the semi-finals

and finals to be held at Rutgers on December 5-7.

Davidson at the present time “has an excellent,
chance to receive a bid, if we remain undefeated.” (Coach '
Foglman). The four teams considered the best in this
area all play each other. So far, Davidson has beaten two
of these teams and lost to State. State at the same time
has been beaten by North Carolina and North Carolina
and Duke must still play each other.

The biggest obstacle to a Davidson bid would seem to
be in the fact that also in the Southern Division are two
of the most powerful teams in the land—Maryland (no. 2
in America the last two years) and Navy. How the
presence of these two powerhouses will affect Davidson's
chances for a bid remain to be decided by the National
Selection Committee.

There is one further consideration which muddies
the outcome of the soccer season: the National
Tournament to be held at Rutgers is for rhajor college
teams. Davidson qualifies due to its schedule for this
tournament, but there is.also a tournament for the Na-
tional Collegiate Small College Division to be held at
Tufts College and Davidson qualifies for the second
tournament.

Obviously a team cannot receive bids from two
tournaments sponsored by the same organization, but
the question is to which tournamerit Davidson can be
invited has not been determined. At the present time the
athletic office is in communication with the NCAA of-
ficials to determine the alternatives open to this year’s
eam.

Such alternatives raise the speculation as to which
tournament Davidson should attend if given the option.
To be perfectly frank the major college tournament could
involve competition with a team which gives as many as
10 soccer scholarships and could very well mean elimina-
tion in the opening.round. The small college tournament,
on the other hand, is made up of schools who either do
not subsidize soccer (Davidson) or do so only in a limited:
way.

The choice is no easy one. In one direction lies
prestige and almost assured defeat. In the other direction
lies the possibility of advancement and perhaps a cham-
pionship. ,

Any mention of national tournaments involves a
great deal of speculation and bubble blowing. So, for the
present time, perhaps the bubble blowing ought to take
a second seat to the playing lest the bubble break and the
beginnings of an excellent soccr season disappear into
apathy over pipe dreams.

HOMECOMING FOOTBALL ...

Amidst the smells of autumn and those of the. other
sex, Davidson’s winless football team searches for its
first victory tomorrow against Presbyterian.

Lest Davidson’s record suggests that anything writ-
ten about: them is done in the form of an apology, I hope
to correct that suggestion. In Davidson's last two outings
I can’t find that much about which to apologize.

Three weeks ago the ’Cats tied VMI, a team that last
week lost to nationally ranked Navy by one touchdown.
Last week Davidson lost to a heavily favored Richmond
squad who had previously been beaten by Florida (35-28)
by one touchdown.

Surely too much boasting cannot be done about one
tie and one loss. Just as surely, Davidson was beaten by
Richmond. The statistics of the game were decidedly and
accurately one-sided but Davidson could have won—a
pass interception choked off an offensive drice inside.

In the loss there were two noticable bright spots.
One was the mental attitude of the team, reported by all
observers of the game to be extremely high. It appears
that at least the football team hasn’t given up on itself.
They were just beaten by a better team. ;

The second bright spot was the play of senior Earl
Cole. Cole, playing quarterback and defensive back, turn-
ed in more individual tackles than anyone on the field,
constantly stopping the Richmond backs at the line of
scrimmage. Cole’s play did not go entirely unnoticed.
He was nominated by the press for the Southern Confer-
ence back of the week.

In the results of the last two contests, the football
team has nothing for which to be ashamed. Perhaps this
is best reflected in the fact that they were up for the
Richmend contest. But pride is another matter and
nothing supplies that like winning.

Upsets Mark Flickerball Action

As flickerball moves into its
final week, two things are ob-
vious: days are getting shorter
and almost nobody is immune to
defeat. Even those teams who
seem to have developed the
greatest immunity have had
their share of close calls.

The Phi Delts, for example,
experienced the first half trau-
ma of almost losing to the
SAE's. The “sons of Minerva”
led 6-0 at halftime but the Delts
came back with three touch-
downs in the second half to win

In the SAESigma Nu game,
the tables were turned. The
Nu's were leading by only one
touchdown with less than two
minutes to go; the SAE’s were
inside the Nu 18-yard line.
“Grub” Oehler preserved the
victory by intercepting a pass
and taking it all the way back.

Frosh-Soph BB Game

BY FORREST ROLES

In a thrill packed game, the
Sophomore Class pulled out a
71-68 overtime victory over the
freshmen in the opening action
of freshman field day. Dick
Snyder led the sophomores with
28 points and Dick Byrd led the
freshmen with 21.

Behind 65-61 with 1:44 to go
in the regular period, the fresh-
men tied the game on an out-
side shot by Byrd and a lay-up
by Joe) Williamson. The soph-
omores froze the ball until 10
seconds were left, but they fail-
ed to get off a shot when Snyder
was heavily covered.

in the overtime, the freshmen

took an early three-point lead.

and Barry St.Clair’s foul shot,
but in the last three minutes and
22 seconds they failed to score.
Snyder brought the margin
down to one point with a hook

shot with 2:11 left; Ron 6tone

put the sophomores ahead to
stay with a layup at 1:15, and
foul shots by Stone and Rufus
Adair put the game out of reach.
Freshman Coach Perry Hol-
land insisted that it was far too
early to judge how good his
team now is or will be. “We
haven't had time to organize
yet,” he said, “but I expect big
things from these boys.”

Denny Phillips, in a turnabout,
took first place with a fast 21:30
clocking over the 42 mile
course. He was followed. close-
ly by John Barrow and Tommy
Heffner, both winners in.prev-
ious meets.

Andy Little and Ronnie Reese
captured fifth and sixth places
coming in under 22 minutes.
Davidson's pushers finished
mixed in with the pack, with
persistent Steve Bunch fighting
a sustained rear-guard action.

Furman, as expected, took its
meet with host Davidson last
Friday, but the ‘Cat harriers
managed to make it a close 25-
30. The Paladin contingent was
just too strong in capturing the
first three places. As Coach
Heath Whittle pointed out, even
if Davidson could have taken

tailback Lenny Turner several
openings, but in the end the
“Sig defense proved equal to
the job.

Soccer Team Drops First
To Rugged State Wolfpack

BY ERIC NICHOLS

For the first time this year
Davidson's soccer fans went
home disappointed on Monday
as the result of a poorly-played
2-1 defeat by N. C. State.

As one of the players aptly
put it, “We weren’t up enough
for this game. Each team must
have its bad game.” The truth
of the story lies in the play of
the first half.

For the first 44 minutes the
team that had conquered Duke
six days earlier was over-confi-
dent, out-played and out-hustled
man for man. This lack of team-
work was directly related to the
1-0 halftime score favoring the
enthusiastic State squad.

As the third period opened up,
the Wildcats began their fami-
liar aggressive play. Davidson’s
offense literally swept the field
as numerous attempts were
made at the well-guarded Wolf-

The Magnificent Seven Cup
Split In Week's Competition

BY DAVID POWELL

Despite a loss last Friday to Furman. Davidson's
cross-country team rebounded on Tuesday to score de-
cisive victories over Old Dominion and Richmond, 17-38
and 15-41. The meet, held at Richmond, was tri-way but
was scored on a two-way basis.

he is a fine passer. Another
standout is fullback Randy Me-
Cranie, one of their leading
ground gainers.

One bright spot showing
through last week's 13-21 loss
to Richmond was the ‘Cats’ pass-
ing attack. Led by quarterback
Earl Cole, who has completed
27 of 54 passes this year, the
‘Cats gained 110 yards through
the air. In addition to his pass-
ing Cole did a fine job at de-
fensive haWback, climaxed by
a pass interception on the Dav-
idson 10. He raced 80 yards be-
fore he was stopped.

Then a Davidson lineman
downfield on second down with
five to go nullified a pass inter-
ference penalty which would
have -put the ball on the one-
yard line, first down and goal
to go. Instead it was again sec-
ond and five. After two unsuc-
cessful line plunges and a pass
attempt, the ball went over to
Richmond.

Davidson's first scoring play

Presbyterian brings an unim-
pressive 1-4 record into the
game. They won their opener
with Frederick 19-9, but have
lost to Lenoir Rhyne, East Caro-
lina, The Citadel, and last week
to the University of Tampa.
However, Coach Dole reminds,
“P.C. always plays tough against
us. ] can never remember an

the next seven places, the ‘Cats
would have sfil! lost by one
point.

As it was, Davidson did man-
age to take the next five places |
with Barrow, Heffner, Reese.
Phillips and Little crossing the
line in that order. Coach Whit-
tle, in commenting on the two
meets, felt that the team had|
made good showings and was en-!
couraged by “the continued im-,

provement. As things stand‘
now,” he continued, “we're
pointing for the State Meet

in Raleigh on Nov. 4th,”

The Freshman harriers also
lost. to Furman on Friday, but
by a more lopsided 18-40 score.
Still, Bob Sjorgren, who took

of the third quarter brought the
most satisfaction to an expect-
ant crowd as halfback Jan Brak-
el climaxed a penalty kick and
three corner kicks with a well-
directed headshot into the cor-
ner of the cage.

The post-climactic fourth quar-
ter was marked by a general
slowing down on the part of
both teams. State held the edge
as they generally beat Davidson
to the ball. Both squads made a
concentrated effort to break the
tie and repeatedly brought the
ball within scoring range.

The Wolfpack offensive effort
finally came through with a pre-
cision play. The ball was brought
down the side, controlled by
short passes, and then came a
cross and the ball was neatly
deposited in the Davidson goal
to break Wildcat hopes of a
perfect season.
