ALUMNI NOTES

The following letter has been received
by the Alumni Editor. He would be
glad to hear from other old Davidson
men in the service.

435th Depot Detachment, Engineers,

Camp Grééne, Charlotte, N. C.,
February 7, 1918.
“The Davidsonion,”
Davidson, N. C.

With reference to camp life, 1 am
pleased to say that | have found it to
agree with me to the fullest extent, and
am enjoying very much being in the serv-
ice of our dear “Uncle Sam.” We have
a small detachment of only twenty-six
men, the chief duty of which is handling
engineering supplies. We spend a part
of our time in drilling and are to have
guns before long, so that we will at least
not fall far behind the Davidson
“Army.” [am very glad that I took
advantage of the military training at Da-
vidson and believe it is of a great deal of
good to me in keeping up with the drill-

‘ing here. There is one thing which |
have learned about it, however, that we
did not learn in our courses there, and
that is how to get up in the morning to
stand Revielle at 6:30 and go thru our
setting-up exercises by the moonlight.
You can.easily see that we have devoured
all the hot-cakes, mush and quinine (cof-

. fee) by the time the old chepel bell
rings, a sound which we all didn’t like
to hear.

The quarantine which has kept us out
of Charlotte and the mud, have probably
caused some of us to appreciate the Y.
M. C. A. more than ever before. Tho
we do not have so much time off from
our work, we feel the need of some
place for a change, and the “Y” is that
place. 14 you could only see the work
that it is doing in the various buildings
here, you would certainly be glad of hav-
ing given your money to the Y. M. C.
A. War Fund.

The Charlotte people have been very
good to us, especially thru the churches,
and to them we feel very grateful for
such kindness as we have received at
their hands. I was quite agreeably sur-
prised to find Rev. Locke White preach-
‘ing at the First Presbyterian Church,
since the church has been without a pas-
tor. It is quite good to get with an old
Davidson man and talk over old times at
the “Hill.”

I hope everybody there is meeting
with success, and military training com-
ing along the best possible. With all
best wishes to every Davidson man, both
in and out of college, 1 remain,

Loyally,
Jas. T. Mappreey.
