HONORED
SIX MEN BY SIGMA UPSILON

‘The wearers of the mysterious
safety pin have at last been released
from their conspicuous badge. Those
who stayed down town on fast
Thursday night were greeted by the
presence of Enoch, his third daugh-
ter, Deep Dark Despair, and Dr.
Analysis Biology. The leader of the
party was a Japanese peasant. While
this little party rested in White’s
Drug Store the peasant executed a
clog dance in his wooden shoes and
whirled his bamboo cane with such
a vim that the spectators sought
safety under the tables. After this
little’ exhibition, the performers
were initiated into the Blue Pencil
Chapter of Sigma Upsilon. A feed
followed the initiation, which help-
ed greatly to revive the strength of
those initiated after “the riding of
the goat.” .

Those taken in were Eris Cassel,
W. P. Cumming, F. V. Long, D. L.
Mahood and J. R. Walker.

C. M. McCaskill has been pledged
and will be initiated at a later date.

Planned at Meeting
of Trustees

New Professors to be Added—-Dr. J.
B. Wharey Secured as Assis-
tant Professor of English

‘The meeting of the board of trus-
tees last week was one of the most
momentous in recent years, perhaps
in the history of the college. The
constructive work done and planned
for the expansion of the college will
not soon be forgotten.

Almost the entire board was pres-
ent ; 25 in persons, 23 by proxy. This
full attendance was necessary in or-
der to change the charter of the col-
lege, a two-thirds vote being neces-
sary to pass on the changes which
it is desired to make by application
to the legislature. The change asked
for will make the college able to
own five million dollars’ worth of
real estate and an equal amount of
endowment. To make this applica-
tion was the most pressing need
which gave occasion for the meet-
ing.

Kut the trustees did not stop here,
they made provision for the expan-
sion of the college in many other
ways. The salaries of regular pro-
fessors was increased to $3,000 a
year and those of the president and
other professors in like proportion.
The chair of Geology and Mineral-
ogy, the department of Economics,
the Cannon Professorship of English
Bible, and the department of Edu-
cation were established. Dr. Sen-
telle was elected to the Cannon Pro-
fessorship, and Professor Currie was
transferred to the Department of
Economics. Elections to the depart-
ment of Education and of Geology
and Mineralogy. were also made, but
no announcement of the names of
these new professors has been made.
Dr. James B. Wharey, '92, Professor
of English in the University of
Texas, was elected as co-ordinate
Professor of English. The office of
Dean was created, and Dr. Sentelle
was elected to fillit. Dr. W. R. Grey
was elected vice-president of the
college.

Reports were submitted by the
finance committee that substantial
progress was being made in the
projects of enlarging the heating
plant, of erecting a new steam laun-
dry, and of enlarging the house oc-
cupied by the Misses Shumaker to
accommodate 150 students for

Tournament Grand Finale

Place: Atlanta; time: May 13, 14,

legiate Tennis Tournament. Will
Davidson be represénted?

The Southern tournament of last
year was held on the clay courts of
the East Lake Country Club of the
Cracker capital. Davidson's repre-
sentatives on that occasion, in the
persons of Hall and Spence, went
to the finals of the doubles, where
they were eliminated by the cham-
pions of Dixie. Hall went to the
semi-finals in the singles and was
beaten only by Fleiberman, of Tu-
lane, who copped the singles title.
Davidson has both of her last year’s
representaives back, and in addition
to them Tommie Hawkins, local
singles champion of, several years
ago. Will Davidson be represented ?

Davidson has a rep in Atlanta for
the fighting spirit of her teams
which is surpassed by no other
institution. The exchanges of The
Davidsonian are coming in every,
day with tales of what their teams:
are expecting to do in Atlanta. Will
Davidson be represented?

Arrangements for intercollegiate
matches with Trinity and Carolina
are under way. It is also expected
that several teams from nearb
towns will be met in the near fu-
ture. The Atlanta meet is the big
event of the year. Will Davidson be
represented?

Schenck Alternates

The men chosen last Wednesday
night to represent Davidson in the
intercollegiate debates this year are
Chalmers, C. K. Brown, A. P. Or-
mond and Mitchell. All the speak-
ers made good debates and reflected
great credit. on their respective so-
cieties.

The question was: “Resolved,
that the. United States should adopt
some form of compulsory universal
military training.”

C. K. Brown, who opened the de-
bate for the affirmative, gave an ex-
cellent speech in his characteristic
flowery style. A. P. Ormond, who
followed, gave a very convincing ar-
gument from the legal standpoint
of the case. McCaskill had a good
speech and one that showed careful
preparation, but he depended too
much on his notes. Mitchell, the
concluding speaker, in addition to
very forceful arguments, had per-
haps one of the smoothest deliveries
exhibited during the entire evening.

R. E. McClure, who opened the
debate for the negative, had also a

|very smooth delivery, but his argu-

ments were weak. Schenck’s speech,
delivered with all his accustomed
fire and earnestness, was thought
by many to be one of the best of the
evening, but he failed to advance
any new arguments in his rebuttal.
R. 1 L. Liston followed with a
good speech, regular! unctuated
by the Alabama arm signal for “Do

Contest

cats—Sheperd and Miley Hold
Visitors to Two Safeties—
Festerman Pitches Well
‘For Catawba

Davidson added another game to
j her winning streak Saturday by
shutting out Catawba College 8 to 0.
The play was more exciting than
the score indicates and was unusual-
ily fast, as no squabbling was done
jon either side. Six errors marred
ithe game, but aside from this both
;teams put up a good brand of ball.
The Wildcats started the fireworks
in the third inning and from that
time on proceeded to run the score
up. Much of the scoring was due to
the clever execution of the squeeze
play, which the winners used suc-
cessfully three times.

Shepherd made his debut in the
‘box by letting the visitors down
with one hit in the six innings he
‘pitched, This came in the first in-
hing when with two out Atwell con-
nected for a double. From then on
-he had his opponents eating out of
/his hand, only one man reaching
first and that was on an error which
should have been handled without.
difficulty. Miley finished up the
game, allowing one hit and fanning
five. Festerman pitched a good
game for Catawha in the opening,
ibut toward the end began to weak-
ie. Six walked batsmen and two
throws coupled with a few hefty
swats on the part of the Wildcats
spelled defeat for him.

The features of the game was the

these were good clean hits and the
