canceled game with Carolina this weekend, and Georgia sports
brass was in the same pickle because their game with the Tar
Heels was also canceled.

It is no top drawer secret that the Davidson-State game
doesn’t draw an overflow crowd even in Charlotte's Memorial
Stadium, and the State officials knew that. So, by scratching
around and keeping the telephone wires of three states buzzing
for over 24 hours, they managed to put off the contest with
the Cats and arrange for their not-so-vaunted Wolfpack to
play Georgia. In the overall picture, the fact that the Pack got
“beat 49-0 doesn’t seem to make much difference, especially since
they made well upwards of $25,000 on the little jaunt to
Athens. “ °

Chances are that the whole business wouldn't have made
much difference to anybody at Davidson had the other two
schools involved in L’ Affaire Snafu simply bothered to tell them
what was going on before the shuffle was announced. Somebody
along the line evidently didn’t know or didn’t care that it takes
three parties to make a tripartite agreement.

Whittle Also Worked Fast

The tragedy at Chapel Hill in which two members of the
Carolina football team and several other students were struck
down by polio also caused UNC officials to cancel the Tar
Heel cross country meet with Davidson this weekend, but Coach
Pete Whictle wasn't about to let his team get stale.

Instead, the Dean of the Davidson coaching staff got busy
and managed to arrange a meet with not one but two other
teams and, incidentally, got his boys out of a couple days of
classes. The meet. an indoor event, was run against the Univer-
sity of Tennessee and Maryville College this afternoon in Knox-
ville.

It probably isn't very widely known, but Cat’ quarterback
Jack Ruth was the leading passer in the Southern Conference
after the Washington and Lee game. With 15 completions in 30
attempts, Jack had accounted for 129 yards and one touchdown
with his aerials. If Kings Mountaineer Ruth can just start hit-
ting for the distance and thereby break open the opponents’ de-
fenses a little, the Cats will have much easier sledding. |

Another Wildcat who is pushing at the top of Conference
statistics is Bobby Renn, the Henderson booter, who has punted
17 times in two games for an average of 40.1 yards.

Alternate captain Dick Kelley leads Davidson scoring for
the two games played so far this year. He’s caught two of Ruth’s
heaves for touchdowns, plus four others for a total of 66 yards.

As a team, the Cats ranked second behind UNC in punting
after the W&L game. Bud Wallace is the man who boots the
ball for the Tar Heels, who won't get back into action until
next week when they take on Wake Forest.

Pre-Season Workouts Everywhere

We mentioned at the beginning of this column that as far
as intercollegiate competition is concerned, things have been
pretty quiet around Johnston Gym for the past several days.
But everywhere you look somebody is getting ready for a season
which is just around the corner.

Coach Danny Miller isn't allowed to start working with
his basektball team until November 1, but almost any afternoon
he can be seen just sitting quietly on the bleachers on the court
watching a group of varsity hopefuls in a pickup game. About
the best prospect he’s got at the present time is the boy who
followed him from Wingate Junior College to Davidson, fresh-
man Darrell Floyd.

Floyd, who made little All-America at Wingate last year,
won't be eligible for Conference play this year since he left Win-
gate before completing his two-year course there. But if Darrell
stays around for a year, he'll be heard from in no small way.

In the swimming pool Tyke Ellis is supervising the early
workouts of the Cat tank men, who have a pretty good chance
of equalling if not bettering their 6-4 record of last year. Cap-
tain Jim Bryan and Al Ormond, last year's high point man,

Harriers Meet
Tennessee At

Maryville,
Knoxville

By BILL SLEDGE

Coach Pete Whittle’s cross countrymen met Maryville Col-
lege and the University of Tennessee this afternoon in Knox-

ville in a specially arranged triangular event.

Davidson was regularly sched-
uled -to mect the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but
this meet was cancelled due to the
polio quarantine there.

State Was Superior

N. C. State's superior running
completely overpowered the Wild-
cats last week at Raleigh, but
Coach Whittle stated that all his
men ran a good race and that com-
petition from here on out wouldn't
be nearly as stiff as it was at State.

Coach Whittle wouldn’t make
any predictions as to the out-

In Fall Match

Tennis Coach Dick McKee will

cat netmen are capable of when

season match. |

Later this fall the Cats will meet
P.C. again, and McKee is now
negotiating for a couple more off-
season matches with Duke.

“Davidson’s tennis team
should be very solid all the
way down, with not a great
amount of difference between
the number one and two men
and the fifth and sixth men.”
That was McKee's estimate of

his club after watching the Wild-
cats in the two weeks of fall prac-
ice.

The tentative lineup for the
atch tomorrow will include in the
singles: Lacy Keesler, Johnny
Bremer, George Snead, Corky
Clark, Leighton Green, and Bill
Bivins in that order.

Joe Dudley, a stalwart in
singles and doubles last year
has been giving most of his
time to basketball this fall and
will not play in the singles.
However, he and Snead will
combine forces to form the
number two doubles team.

Other doubles combos will be:
one, Keesler and Bremer; and
three, Green and Bivins.

For the first time in several years
Davidson has failed to come up
with an outstanding freshman pros-
pect, although there are several ca-
pable frosh out for the team. Last
season there were four freshmen
whn saw action on the. varsity
squad, including Keesler, the num-
ber one man. Others were Corky
Clark, Leighton Green, and George
Snead. Since these four will prob-
ably alt be playing regularly for
the next three years, Coach McKee
has no immediate cause for anxiety
over the future. —

for very little is known about
either of the Cats’ opponents.
However, he did point out that
Duke whipped Tennessee last
week, and that Tennessee out-

season.

_ (Cat Assault At Raleigh

U

State College's Wolfpack will be dug in with backs to the
wall tomorrow afternoon when Davidson invades Riddick Sta-
dium in Raleigh. Game time is 2:30.

Both teams will be trying des-
perately for their first win of the
season in this Southern Conference
contest. The Cats have lost to VPI
and Washington & Lee while State
has dropped three, including a 39-0
loss to George Washington and a

49-0 drubbing from Georgia last

weekend.
Postponed a Week

The State game, originally sched-
uled for last Saturday, was post-
poned a week in order to allow the
Pack to play Georgia. Both State
and Georgia were due to suffer
terrific financial ‘losses when the
University of North Carolina, hit
by polio, was forced to cancel
their games with these teams.

State is a beaten ball club
in more ways than one. They
suffered two hard setbacks
