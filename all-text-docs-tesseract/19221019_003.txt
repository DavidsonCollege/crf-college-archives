Of Raphael, Turner, Reubens, Hunt
and Michael Angelo,

They were near divine you say; their
paintings were sublime ;

Lut for true beauty I will choose
Coles Phillips every time.

I need say nothing more of him, for
everybody knows

hat he’s the guy that paints those ads
of girls in Holeproof Hose.

Martin Foil says Concord is some
town. They go to Charlotte for the
week-end with a clean collar and a $2

- bill and never change either one.

Ode to Latin 2
By M. IV. Trawick.

My Latin, tis of thee,
Short cut to lunacy,

O’er thee I'll rave;
Another week, or so
Of studying thee I know
Will send me straight below

Down to my grave.

October 12, 1922, 3:10 p. m.—Go. -
don enters the library to purchase two
sheets of drafting paper.

4:10 p. m.—Gordon leaves the
library with two small pieces of draft-
ing paper and his face weathed in
smiles.

Why the Smiles?

D. Sentelle in Bible 2—‘There now,
M. Black, just keep that in mind and
you will have it in a nut shell.”

it is really higher than the upper be-
cause it costs more, while the upper is
lower than the lower. Most people
don’t like the upper, although it is
lower on account of its being higher.
When you occupy an upper you have
to get up to your bed, and then get
lown when you get up. It is best to
take the lower, although it is higher
than the upper for the reason that the
upper is lower because it is higher, In
other words, the higher is the lower.

The bird who, when asked if he ever
kissed his girl under the mistletoe, re-
plied, indignantly, that he never fooled
around the lady’s pedal extremeties.

“Who ever said these professors lead
a fast life? asks Snag Dailey, “none of

two teams in the first four games of
the season are as follows:

V. P. I. 39; Hampden-Sidney 0.
V. P. I. 25; Wings College 6,

V. P. 1. 20; Williams and Mary 6.

V. P. 1. 6; Centre 10,

Davidson 24+; Elon 0,

The Gobblers have rolled up 89
points to 22 for their opponents, while
the Wildeats have scored 37 points
against 33 for their opponents.

When Centre with its powerful of-
fense only could rush one touchdown
across the Gobbler line the prospects
look black for the Wildcats. By com-
parison scores the Wildcats are due
to be beaten with a 50 to 0 or by a
margin of 31 ‘points—but comparative
scores do not take into consideration
that the Wildeats have not been de-
feated on Sprunt Field in many years
