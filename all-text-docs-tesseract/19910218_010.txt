THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1991

By Ben Towle '92 and
Curt Perkins '91

The following is aneeded ex-
planation of several literary de-
vices. I use the word “needed”
because anumber of Davidsonian
readers appear to be having diffi-
culty distinguishing between ar-
ticles written in a serious vein and
articles written with humorous in-
tent.

Writers throughout history (a
generalization) have employed a
number linguistic tricks to pro-
voke a humorous reaction from
their audience. The following
examples (some taken from The
Davidsonian itself) illustrate some
of these and should hopefully
serve as paradigm forreaders who
find themselves befuddled by
articles suchas D.A. Thompson’s:

a) “The Baker Sports complex i is
a very accessible facility, where

a worthy investment to be sure.”

This is an example of both
irony and bitter sarcasm.

b) “Davidson was featured in...
William’F. Buckley Jr’s The Na-
tional Review College Guide.”

This, unfortunately, is not an
example of intentional irony, sar-
casm, Or onomatopoeia; «it is,
however, true.

c) “If other schools give away
money and cars in order to beef up
theirathletic programs, why don’t
we follow suit and start schlep-
ping out afew drinks?” a

Rude Notes & Random Scribblings

On Overly-Spirited,
Alcoholic Homosexuals

Bet that got your attention, now
didn’t it? Well, tough (rhymes
with kitty). I’m-noteven going to
deal with all the crap I and my
fellow columnists have been catch-
ing this week. Even though Mr,
Woods’ roommate has decided to
add to the list of reasons why I
should be immediately impaled
upon the sort of spire which Mr.
Jasper contemplated one opium
addled dawn, I’m just going to let
bygones be bygones. Ie. @*&%
‘em if they can’t take a joke.

(That’s a literary allusion in the
third sentence of the last paragraph,
not an advocation of hallucino-
genic intoxicants. Sorry to disap-
point those of you who had so
quickly hoped to pen a letter in
which you could call for my ar-
Test.)

Actually, this week I’ve come
stand to think of those two for so
long without approaching connip-
tion. So, here weare, I hope you’ ll
enjoy these briefs from-the Rude

A Debate Of Presidential Proportions

The other day I was prying. I
overheard one Davidsonite express
to another his concern that the av-
erage students (there are afew) on
campus did notreflect the growing
national tendency towards politi-
cal apathy in their attitudes con-

cerning the upcoming SGA elec- |

tions:
“Man, anybody that would

David"Pundit"
Scott

wanna’ be SGA pres. must have
the brain of putrid peanut.”
“Yeéah, sort of like one those
shriveled pasty kind that people
‘drop in their beer at ‘baseball

games.”

“Point well taken Dood. Point
well taken.”

Having recently recovered

from a similarly bestial political
stance, I took offense and accosted
the infidels.

“Youinfidels, you "re supposed
toCARE. Things matter. Why must —
you be such slaves to the national
consciousness?” =~

Ire puddled at my feet.

“Dood man ...chillout. Dood.”

Staggered: by this retort, I

watched in mute reverie while the
budding Ciceros sluffed off to the
now cable equipped lounge and
commenced ingesting MTV.

After righting myself I real-
ized, such numbnuttedness_ de-
mands action. So I acted. I deter-
mined that DEPTH, RELE-
VANCE! this week wouldendorse
a candidate in the battle for presi-
dent of the Student Government
Association of Davidson College.
Awareness must be raised.

I wanted my. endorsement to
be. unbiased, to truly reflect. the

(excluding bathrooms) the three
candidates ran fairly even. Cov-
ington tallied 27 (remarkably pleas-
ing to the eye) poster units, Car-
berry 26, while Manjooran swiped
the first stage with a strong show-
ing at the senior apartments for a
final total of 40.

In the Bathroom: category
Manjooran owned the competition;
a significant victory considering
the vital role played by commode
cages in Davidson politics. (As we
all know, the SGA minutes appear

I set off on tour of the vital locations on campus in
search of posters and, in the resulting tally, the

T

salient features involved, and to be
consistent with what the SGA is all
about. I pondered for days, yet the
necessary criteria avoided my
grasp.

Leadership? Snicker. Influ-
ence? Hee-hee. Rhetorical skill?
My side ached. Posters? Bingo!

SGA time at Davidson means
the smell of overheating Xerox
machines hangs heavy in the air.
Candidate’s hands cramp painfully
and pulp wood barons wallow in
greenbacks while the campus or-
ganism convulses ina poster heav-
ing, resonant belch.

Thus I set off on a tour of the
vital locations on campus in search

of posters and, in the resulting tally,

the perfect President for our SGA.
The results I found intriguing.
To increase the efficacy of the
final count, I divided the campus
up into various subsections and
compared results from each.
First, in the general dorm poll

stall walls to enlighten our times
alone.) _

Anyway, colorful “P’s” basi-
cally wall-papered lavatories from
the union to Knox and beyond. In
all I counted 54 “P’s” in campus
johns and several times encoun-
tered as many as four in one bath-
room (once twoin one stall). Nice
work. Covington and Carberry
totaled only about 2-5 signs apiece
(though I must admit I. went in
more little boy’s than little girls
rooms, but “P’s” prevailed even in’
those ladies rooms I did enter). -

_In reporting the results from
here on, totals will be listed in the
following order: Manjooran,
Covington, Carberry.

Manjooran took Chambers 20,

and Carberry registered one apiece
