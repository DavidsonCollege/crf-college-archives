Groups Receive
Activities Funds

By GRAY WILSON
Asst.. Managing ‘Editor
‘Allocations for the Activi-

lies Fund have been made
for the 1970-71 academic
._ year at Davidson, pending
the submission of a revised
budget by the. trustees.

Of the nine groups which
reeeived funds, the Black
Student Coalition and WDAV
are newcomers to the list.

Only ther Pep Band was
denied its request because
it iS tovered by Athletic
®und. Tre group applied for
funds to purchase new bla-
gvevs for the band.

‘The percentages for the
jpie-pan illustration are taken
from a total of $40,000 and
are valued as follows:

Miscellany $4500
SGA 4090
RA 985
Quips and Cranks 12150
‘Artist Series 4750
IDAVIDSONIAN 7475
‘WDAV aw = 1395
iBiatk €dalition 650

Witaeat. Handbook
4nd carryover 4025
total $40,000

College Treasurer Robert
A. Currie said he expected
the carryover for next year

to be a minimum of $2700,
which would leave $1325
from which the | Wildcat
Handbook might draw _ its
funds.

The carryover will be add-
ed to the 1971-72 school year
to hedge against the pre-
dicted results of inflation.

The student activity fee
was increascd from $25 to
$40 this year, and Currie
said he thinks the present
amount can stand through
next year . without an_ in-
crease.

‘Approximately
were requested by all the
groups. Currie stated: ‘Cuts
had to be made in a good
many areas, but L think the
fund is adequate now, and
I would judge that students
do not want it to go any
higher.”’ ;

$44,000.

Red Cross Sponsors Blood Drive

‘The semi-annual Red
‘Cross Blood Drive will take
‘place Monday and Tuesday,
November 2-3, in the base-
ment of Chambers Building.

The drive, sponsored, by
the college ROTC program,
has been significantly reor-
ganized, according to Cadet

Brigade Commander Jack
Steele, ae
“This year, for the first

time, students are in charge
f the blood drive,’ said
Steele. ‘Although we are co-
ordinating our _ activities
with the ROTC Department,

we have made all the ar-
rangements ourselves.”’

Steele noted that the or-
ganizational change is in
keeping with the total pro-
gram of leadership training
which ROTC sponsors.

‘In the opinion of the de-
partment, allowing students
to take charge of the blood
drive was a good way to
give us practical experience
in leadership,"’ he said.

Steele added that the
blood bank would be .ipen on
both Monday and Tuesday
from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

Sterling Claims
No Aid Cutbacks

By JIM HANNA

There has been no ¢ut-
back in Davidson's financial
aid program, according to
Financial. Aid Director Pe-
ter V. Sterling.

°Sterling also said that
“next year we plan a pro-
gram to meet the needs of
all students who require
financial aid.’

Sterling noted that com-
plaints from’ students about

‘economic factors,

traced to a ‘“‘lack of com-
munication—between- the fi:

nancial aid office and the
students,”’ -

Another cause of confu-
sion, said Sterling, is that
“Davidson offers financial
aid equal to this office's
calculation of a_ student's

need. Many times the stu-
dent's estimate of his need
will vary from ours, and so
the student feels he has not
received an adequate
amount.

Sterling characterised Da-
vidson as “‘one of the few
colleges who are able to of-
fer such a complete financi-
al aid program.”

“Our contribution has in-
creased over the years,’
said Sterling. “Fifty-six per
cent of the students’ here
receive some sort of finan-
cial aid.’’

Sterling said that outside

a cutback in federal
private funds and
college costs, were “pubting
the squeeze on Davidson.”

“There was ‘a -decrease
from last year in the amount
of Federal monies granted
to Davidson, and I expect
another | decrease next
year.”’

He also pointed out that

for students whose family

year. Only five percent of
Davidson enrollees fall into
this bracket.

Sterling said that David-
son is making an effort to
recruit low-income pro-
spects, and that this te-
quires aid money be redis-
tributed to allow for these
students’ greater need.
