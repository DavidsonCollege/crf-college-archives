Two Million-Dollar Gifts
Establish Scholarships
and a Professorship

Two Davidson alumni have
recently given the college sepa-
rate million dollar gifts - one fora
scholarship program and one fora
professorship.

Talented Davidson students
from middle income families will
benefit from the million dollar
scholarship endowment being cre-
ated by an anonymous alumnus
and his wife. The scholarships
will attract promising science and
mathematics students from middle
income families in North Caro-
lina and the Appalachian region
of the South.

Mathematics and science are
special interests of the donors,
who were motivated to arrange
the gift by their long-time interest
in young people and their strong
tiés to the college through three
generations of their family attend-
ing Davidson.

The other million-dollar gift
came from Joseph R. Morton ’20
ofGreensboro. Morton’s gift will
establish the Joseph R. Morton
Professorship in chemistry, phys-
ics or mathematics. These are

‘areas which he enjoyed most at
Davidson and which provided
skills instrumental to his success
in the chemical industry:

The professorship represents
the major philanthropic gift of
Morton’s lifetime.

Working with estate planning
advisors and members of the
college’s planned giving staff, the
donors all made use of property
held for many years. Julius
Melton, who directs Davidson’s
planned giving program, ex-

plained, “Through these.types of
arrangements the donors were able
to augment their incomes substan-
tially while also arranging signifi-
cant endowments for a professor-
ship and a scholarship.”

President John Kuykéndall
said, “We are tremendously grate-
ful for these exciting commitments.
This new scholarship will address
the needs of a group that is often
squeezed out of other scholarship
programs. It will have a strong
impact on keeping Davidson af-
fordable for every qualified stu-
dent. With the Morton Professor-
ship, our efforts to ensure quality
teaching are dramatical strength-
ened. The hallmark of Davidson
remains that unique relationship
between the faculty and our stu-
dents.”

The new scholarships will
carry a stipend of $5,000 above
demonstrated financial need. A
committee, including two alumni
who aré scientists, will assist the
admission committee with its final
selection of recipients.

The million dollar scholarship
and professorship gifts lift the total
commitments received during The
Campaign for Davidson to $106
million.

New NEH Grant for Humanities
Program Carries a Challenge

A $275,000 grant Davidson
recently received from the National
Endowment for the Humanities
Challenge Grant Program will re-
ward Davidson’s excellent teach-
ers as well as improve its Humani-
ties.Program. The purpose of the
grant is “to promote and reward
excellence in teaching the Humani-
ties to undergraduate students, and
to identify outstanding teachers so
that they may be models and men-
tors to others.”

Davidson must match the
amount of the grant 3-to-1 by rais-
ing $825,000 in new, non-federal
contributions to the school by July
31, 1996.

The money will establish an
endowment for distinguished
teaching professorships based
solely on classroom teaching ex-
cellence.

Peter Krentz, chair of
Davidson’s Humanities Program,
wrote the main proposal for the
grant. He said that an “internal,
rotating chair” will be established,
awarded to a different Davidson
professor every two years. This
professor will devote a majority of
his or her time to Davidson’s Hu-
manities Program for a two-year
span, and will receive a salary
supplement to equal the salaries of
other endowed chairs at Davidson.
The endowment will also enable
the professor’s department to hire
a two-year replacement for the
position lost to the Humanities.

In the first year in the en-
dowed chair, honorees will team-
teach all four courses in the two-
year Humanities sequence to get a
feel for what the program encom-
passes. :

In the second year honorees
will choose atheme to develop and
present to Humanities students ina
series of lectures, and to present to
peers in workshop the following
summer. The professor will also
teach two Humanities courses.

Finally, in the year following
their distinguished professorship,

honorees will teacha seminar about
their theme in the Humanities pro-
gram for junior and senior stu-
dents.

* Nominations for endowed pro-
fessorships will be initiated from
students, faculty and alumni. The
Dean of the Faculty and the chair

of the humanities program will
select Distinguished Teaching Pro-
fessors, based in part on discus-
sions of the themes the candidates
propose for development. Krentz
believes that in addition to reward-
ing outstanding classroom teach-
ers, the grant will improve
Davidson’s Humanities Program.
He said that having a professor
working with the Humanities Pro-
gram for two years, observing
classesand developing themes, will
make the entire program more co-
herent and will re-invigorate the
regular Humanities staff.

Davidson’s Humanities Pro-
gram has been a cornerstone of its
liberal arts education since 1962,
and currently involves 20 profes-
sors from 10 different departments.

Competition among schools
to receive to receive this N.E.H.
grant was lively. Davidson’s
$275,000 grant came in light of a
maximum award of $300,000.
According to Nancy Maydole, di-
rector of grants and contracts, most
other winning schools got grants
in the $150,000 dollar range.

Davidson professors assisting
Krentz in writing the proposal were
Trent Foley, Libby Mills, Brian
Shaw, Vivien Dietz and Mary
Thornberry, as well as staff mem-
ber Maydole. Steve Whisnant,
director of major gifts, and Kevin
McCarthy, director of corporate
and foundation relations, devel-
oped the fundraising plan for the
proposal,

RECYCLE THE

lease with the college in July un-
der which the church is respon-
sible for building maintenance and
improvements. The lease in-
cluded a provision that the col-
lege cover expenses to bring the
building “up to speed,” which in-
cludes most of the current paint-
ing and floor finishing work.

Rev. Charlie Raynal,
DCPC’s pastor, said the new
three-tone color scheme in Lingle
Chapel and the main sanctuary
accentuated the intricate millwork
in those spaces. The pews were
removed so the parquet floors in
both sanctuaries could be refin-
ished, and the pews in Lingle
Chapel are being reinstalled far-
ther apart, with several pews mov-
ing upstairs to the balcony.

The dossal cloth against the
south wall of the main sanctuary
has been replaced,:and the cross
that stood on the wall in front of it
is being moved to Lingle Chapel.
A new, larger cross that has been
donated by a member of the con-
gregation will be placed in the
main sanctuary. A lot of elbow
grease from members of the con-
gregation has broughtout the shine
in the building’s brass work. The
organ was tuned and repaired, and
the sound system was redone so
that Raynal will now communi-
cate with his congregations via a
wireless microphone.

Raynal said it has beenachal-
lenge to continue worship ser-
vices during the.work. .DCPC’s
congregation sat in pews on one
side of the sanctuary while those
on the other side were removed,
and Catholics coming to their
weekly worship service in Lingle
Chapel have been sitting in fold-
ing chairs on the bare floor there.

The recent work has been
restricted to the two sanctuaries.
Theadministrative and classroom
areas of the building will be refur-
bished in connection with the
church’s expansion, which is
scheduled to begin early next year.
Raynal said the congregation now
hopes notonly to enlarge the base-
ment-level fellowship hall but to
