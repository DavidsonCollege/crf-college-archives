February 8, 1980—The Davidsonian—9

My opinion
incompatibility
led to firing

By BILL WILSON
Special to The Davidsonian
The failure to renew Karl

Kremser’s contract at the end of
this year undoubtedly surprised
many people, although perhaps
it should not have. Kremser,

this year's Southern Conference.

Soccer Coach of the Year, is a
man who has definite feelings
about the sport of soccer. These
beliefs, however, have often
been incompatible with those of
the: Athletic Department, and
as much as anything appear to
have cost him his job.

When he arrived at Davidson
in the summer of 1977 Kremser
immediately surprised some
sports observers with his de-
manding practice regimen and
his diatribes against slipshod
play. The young team failed to
win a game that first season.

Kremser soon realized a
group of good young players
was essential in developing a
strong soccer program. Al-
though provided with only a

shoestring budget, he insisted”

on a heavy recruiting program,

and often had to approach

Ernie Riegel reflects on his college basketball career.

If Emie Riegel could go back
to high school and start over,
he’d do the same thing; he’d
come to Davidson and play
basketball. He’d do a few things
differently along the way and
maybe hope for better results,
but he has no regrets about
coming to North. Carolina from
White Cloud, Michigan.

The only things he says he

would do differently given the
opportunity would be “on the
basketball court assert myself
more, and off-court, I’d get
involved in more activities.”
- Todo either would be easy for
some people on their hypothet-
ical second trip through school,
but Riegel hasn’t much room for
improvement. His coach, Eddie
Biedenbach, said, ‘Any basket-
ball coach would like to have a
guy like Ernie; he’s.a great floor
leader. He's aware of things on
the floor and alert to what we
should be doing.”

As far as extra activities go,
Riggel summed up his feelings
by . “It’s hard to have
any time to do anything else
with basketball at a place like
Davidson which is so academie-
ally oriented.’’ Practice time
adds up to about three hours a
day for a large part of the school
year for Wildcat players. With
games and travel added on to
that, basketball players hardly
have time for anything else.

Ernie Reige!

‘“‘A major problem comes
with missing school because of
the various away games,” Rie-
gel said, ‘“But most professors

, are very understanding; I’m
thankful for that.”

Riegel is a senior- and is now
in his last month of college
basketball; his four years at
Davidson have not been easy
ones for a Wildcat basketball
player. Riegel was recruited to
Davidson by Coach Dane
Pritchett, .and then played un-
-der Coach John Kochan; for the
last two years he has played for
Biedenbech.

**T had only the faintest
knowledge about Davidson
when I was recruited,’’ said
Reigel, “but I liked my visit
here. The school was. different
from the ones at home and I
liked it. Pritchett looked good
and, at the time, I thought the
program would turn around.
-We’ve been in a lot of games,
but we haven’t had winning
seasons. It’s been a disappoint.
ment in that respect.”” ‘

Riegel sees the turnover of
coaches as one of the main
reasons for the team’s dismal
results over the last years. “We
haven't bad sensitive coach-
player, player-coach selation-
ships,” he said, “and that is
what we've needed.”

“Davidson needs to stick
with Biedenbach for at least
another couple more years and
let his players establish a close

relationship of understanding,
trust, and confidence with him
and he with them,”’ Riegel
continued. “A coach needs to
have the players he recruited for
four years to-see what he can
do. Biedenbach’s learned a lot
about coaching since he’s -been
here.”

Riegel recognizes the ‘‘valid
point” of the people who ques-
tion the money spent on David-
son's basketball program, but
he holds that Davidson is
recognized because of the bas-
ketball schedule. He believes a
winning team will calm any

criticism and be the outlet that

the school needs.

“We need a winning team to.

get alumni support; then- we'll
have something to rally around..
People want-something besides
just a good academic: program
like we have here. Basketball
can be that something.”

With his English major, Rie-

gel plans to attend law school at
either Tulane or William and
Mary next year. Aside from
that, his future plans ate uncer-
tain.
But for the rest of this year,
he’s hoping the Cats will get in
double figures in the win col-
umn. If we can get some
momentum and start playing
well, something will go right for
us at the end of the season.

“That'll help a lot in recruit-
ing,” he added. “People look to
see how you end up.”

Wildcats lose to Citadel
in overtime Wednesday

By BERT MOBLEY
Staff Writer
The ‘‘Catnap’’ may be over as

the Davidson College basketball:

calendar says, but it’s been a
long nap and it’s taking thé
Wildcat a mighty long time to
arouse himself from slumber.

- Davidson lost its fifteenth

game of the year (with 7
victories) last night against the
Citadel in Charlotte 98-88 in
overtime.

The Cate now have an 0-4
record in the Southern Confer-
ence with one league game to go
against Appalachian State in
Boone Saturday, Feb. 16. The
winner of this game will stay
out of the conference cellar and
meet league-leading ‘Furman in
Greenville in the first round of
the S.C. tournament in early
March.

_ Davidson controlled the game
last night through the regula-
tion periods but allowed. The
Citadel to get close at the end.
The Bulldogs took a two point
lead with less than a minute to
go and Rich DiBennedetto was
forced to sink two free throws
with five seconds to get the
74-74 tie. The Cata had led by
as many as 1] points during the
game and had a 38-30 halftime
lead.
Davidson was connecting in
the five-minute extra period but
got in a position of having to
foul to get the bail. The
Citadel’s Greer Huguley went
10-10 from the free throw line to
assure the Bulldogs of their
win.

The ten-point margin is mis-
leading; Davidson was within
four points with less than a
minute and a half remaining in
the overtime. —

_ The Cats played without
center Jamie Hall who is in a

in the loss at Notre Dame. He
should be ready for action in

Saturday night’e game against .

South Carolina in the Coliseum.
The competition is no easier
next Wednesday night in Win-
ston-Salem when the Cats take
on Wake Forest.

While the outlook is not
bright in these games, David-
son fans are looking for the
yearly upset which has become
a tradition. Two years ago the
Cats surprised the South Caro-
lina Gamecocks and last year
had big upeet over Wake in
Chariotte.

Davidson opened up the week
with a sound drubbing by the
Irishmen of Notre Dame last
Saturday night. DiBenedetto
hit 8 of 14 from the floor and
made good 16 of his 22 free
throws for a total of 31 points,
but the Cats could have used
another $1 pointe and still come
up short. Notre Dame finished
on top with a 105-71 final.

Three Davidson players ac-
counted for 61 of the Davidson
total. In addition to DiBene-
detto’s 31, Hell had 16 and
Haynes added 14.

The Wildcats entered Mon-
day night's all-important con-
ference game with UT-Chatta-
nooga optimistically, but the
second half syndrome which has
plagued the Cate before struck
again. As in earlier games
against Furman and Western

‘Carolina, the Cats played close

in the first half and then let
things get totally out of hand.
UT-Chattanooga turned a two-
point halftime lead into a 90-75
victory. ,

Once again DiBenedetto was
the main offense for Davidson
with 29 points. Haynes pumped
in 18 while freshman Cliff
Tribus, filling in for injured
Jamie Hall, scored 16 pointe.

“Offensively, we're doing all
right,” Biedenbach said.
**We're hitting 50 percent or
better from the floor and 80
percent from the line. Scoring is
not our problem, but losing

ies is.” Davidson had

24 turnovers against Notre
Dame and 28 against UT-Chat-
tanooga.

Wildcattes
win two,
drop one

Midwinters came to David-
son but the Cattes hit the road
and were Wild. Friday night
they defeated Meredith College,
53-39, and Saturday night they ©
held on against North Carolina
Wesleyan to defeat the Bishops
in double overtime, 79-77. As
with all big weekends, the good
times have come to an end
and they did for Davidson on
Tuesday night when they
traveled to UNC-G and were
defeated by the Spartans,
14-00.

The Wildcattes play against
Meredith was not overly im-
pressive but their full-court
man-to-man defense seemed to

the field and 60% from the line
for the game but that wae
enough to assure a victory as
Meredith shot only 17% from
the field in the second half.

Sarah Womack and Kirby -
Owen led Davideon’s scoring
with 12 points apiece. Jeanne
Womack had ® points and 10
rebounds.

Friday night Davidson
travels to Fayetteville to take
on Methodist, a team that beat
Davidsen rather handily when
they played before Chrietmae
break. The Cattes’ next home
game is Monday, Feb. 11,
against Meredith College. Tip-
off time is 7 p.m. Z
