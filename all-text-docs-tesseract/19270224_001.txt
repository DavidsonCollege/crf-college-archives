The class of '29 assembled last Tuesday

night in Charlotte on the roof garden of

the Johnson building, almost one hun-

dred per cent strong, and enjoyed what

ever given by a Sophomore class. The

program was inspiring as well as enter-

taining, and a great time was had by all.

The program was opened by an invoca-

tion by Bob Covington, followed by an|

address of weleome by Bob Kell, presi-|

dent of the class.

as a]
and began the second weék
of this attempt to decide upon their life
work.

“The well-trained instructor is fast be-
coming a person who can expect and de-
mand a respectable salary because he is
expected to be a scientifically trained in-
dividual. He is also supposed to give
from a richness of experience and infor-
mation likely to. stimulate a child mind,”
said the visiting speaker.

He stated that there was no more ex-
hilarating sport than to awaken young)
men to life’s opportunities. The declara-.
tion of Dr. Elliott, late president-emeritus
of Harvard was cited as an inducement to |
enter the teaching profession, for Dr. |
Elliott has said that he would rather be
a school teacher than anything else in the
world. “Fame, fortune, and heauinea|
came to him by the highway of school
teaching,” asserted Dr. Noble.

In closing his address the speaker said
that the price of being an instructor of
education was laid down in “terms of a
sound mind and a sound body, constant
and well-organized study, and a desire
for mental development.”
