Several of the boarding houses on
Monday made arrangements for a meat-
less day or a meatless meal each day.
This is the result of Dr. Martin’s appeal
to the patriotism of the student body.
If you want to sce this spirit as fine as
it can be found at any place—come to
Davidson. This is a fine spirit and
shows the willingness to make a little
sacrifice. This scheme is endorsed and
heartily commended to private families
as well as boarding houses.

This week’s columns contain a very
interesting letter from Dr. Lingle, who
is now in France. We have other let-
ters about the military life which will

If ALL THE ALUMNI
FELT THIS WAY:

In ‘THe Davinsontax P.O. box was
found the other day a communication
addressed to “The Commanding Officer
of THe Davinsonian.” which read
somewhat as follows:

“Inclosed you will find a check, which,
by the way, is not bogus. In return for
this check . . . you will please send me
‘Tar Davipsonian for a period of nine
months, beginning immediately. It is
like grape-nuts to me—TI can't live with-
out it— There's a reason.’

“With best wishes for a most. profit-
able and prosperous year to you all, [am

“Very truly yours,
(Signed) S.C. Harris.”

There would be no need of a circula-
tion manager to dig up subscriptions—
but ‘twould take half a dizen to record
the subscriptions, an equal number of
business managers to sign the checks,
and a wheelbarrow in which to carry the
“kale” to the bank.

Have you done your part to bring
about such a condition? — 0. J. T., JR.

“A man who is not faithful to his col-
lege duties this year is a slacker.”—Dr.
Poteat, President Furman University.

“Lost is that man to tribe, to. social
usage, and homeless
Whoso, his people among, promoteth
palsying discord.”
—Nestor, in The Haid.

“Activity is man’s energy supply."—
Dr. Kepner.

“Men get enjoyment out of activity
rather than pacifity."—Dr. Sentelle.

“Man's evolution is. psychic, rather
than a spatial or a material one; the
inoral, rather than the physical aspect.”
—Dr. Kepner.

It is good to look things and facts in
the face, but there is a proper time, place
and audience.

“PETE” SAUNDERS ARRIVED
UNEXPECTEDLY LAST FRIDAY

The climate influences our achitecture
—for that matter, all. architecture. At-
mospheric conditions have considerably
changed since Chambers Building was
erected in this fifties.

The student body is greatly pleased to
See A. P. Saunders, ‘18, again on the
campus. The arrival of “Pete” this
week was somewhat earlier than has
been expected, according to the infor-
mation which had been previously re-
ceived in regard to his condition.

“Pete” and his mother, Mrs. A. P.
Saunders, are now with his aunt, Mrs.
A. B. Robeson. He will soon assume
his college duties.

R. B. Peters, 118, came down in the
