What They’re Saying

“Grade inflation, by
definition, involves a rise
in grades without a
concurrent rise in student
performance.”

—Hadley & Vitale, 1985,
as reported in the Texas
Education Review

“Tf you take out the
exceptions like Harvard,
we are not far out of line
with the rest of the
country.”

—Hansford Epes,
Davidson Registrar

“And it positions
Princeton to take national
leadership in tackling what
has seemed an intractable
national problem.”
—Princeton Dean of the
College Nancy Malkiel, on
passing the proposal

“Princeton [is] taking
risks to fix a problem. But
it’s also image
management... Is it an
academic question ora PR
question?”

- —Davidson Director of
Career Services John
Adams

“c

‘Anywhere else it
would’ve been anA.’... B
on your paper? Could’ve,
should’ve been an A. Can't
pass the swim test? Go
splashing anywhere else.”
—Opening paragraph of
Swarthmore’s The Phoenix
article on grade inflation

“It'll be like the nuclear
arms race, but with people
hoarding A’s instead of
weapons.”

—Princeton freshman Vera
Dadok, on increased
academic competition as a
result of the just-passed
faculty proposal assigning
grade expectations

“T think it is perfectly
reasonable that the faculty
should say that only
around a third of work
generally deserves an A,
and to recalibrate grades

Ato that standard.”
—Princeton freshman
Charlie Stone, on the same

proposal

Gender gap in average GPA, women higher

An investigation into historical
GPA data provided by the Registrar’s
Office has turned up a surprising
result: the average of women’s GPA
is consistently higher than the aver-
age of all-students GPA and the av-
erage of all men’s GPA. The differ-
ences ranged from 0.066 to 0.257
points in any given year, with the
mean difference being 0.157 points.

What could be causing the dispar-
ity? Davidson’s gender equity policy
in Admissions might be culpable.
Davidson students commented on
whether they think girls are studying
harder than guys, vice versa, or no
difference. But two professors specu-
lated on causes other than women are
smarter or study harder than men.

Dean of Faculty Clark Ross said,
“If there is a statistically significant
difference by gender, the obvious
question is why. I suspect there are
different hypotheses one could test.”

Ross proposed testing for group
differences in ability, time spent
studying, and course and major se--
lection.

Dr. David Martin, also an Econom-
ics professor, suggested another im-
portant factor could be, “If one gen-
der goes abroad to non-Davidson
program more than the other, then
that gender will have more pass-fails
on record than the other.”

All theories are plausible conjec-
ture to explain away some or all of
the difference. No data was available
to test them at the time of press.

Students offered conflicting an-

swers when asked if women study
harder to get better grades than men.

Carrington Skinner ’07 said, “I
think girls work much harder and
stress much more than guys at
Davidson from my perspective.

_ Though I noticed trends like this in

high school, it seems to be almost
across the board here at Davidson.”

Anne Hedgepath ’07 disagreed,
saying, “Girls tend to be much more
vocal about their stress, from my
experience... [but] at Davidson I
think most people work the same
amount.”

Michael Galdo’04 emphasized the
inability to make a direct compari-
son. He said, “My gut reaction is that

the girls I know stress about grades a
bit more, but the more I think about
it the more I realize it’s impossible to
make a generalization about the is-
sue.”

The issue is made more salient
when put in the perspective of
Davidson’s gender policy in Admis-
sions. The Board of Trustees-man-
dated policy insists on maintaining a
gender balance of 50-50 women-to-
men over the four classes.

While most faculty and adminis-
trators defend the policy, some have
criticized it because the admissions
pool is frequently much more com-
petitive for women, as they outnum-
ber men in applicants but equal them

in spots.

In the February 11, 2004 issue of
The Davidsonian, President Vagt
defended the policy in part by say-
ing, “At the end of the day... you do
not have a situation where men are at
the bottom of the GPA totem pole...
if that were the casé, [the system]
would be unfair.” '

Inresponse to these latest findings,
Vagt said, “My comment was in-
tended to extend to a disparity that
was bigger than [the gap that was
found].”

The difference occurred in all 28
years for which data was
available, going back to 1980
and including the four current under-
graduate classes.

A quick analysis using statistical
techniques found the difference to be
statistically significant, though nota
very good predictor—in essence, one
may conclude that the average of
women’s GPA is higher than men’s,
but not that being female will result
in a high GPA.

In addition, the difference was
noted in six of the seven most popu-
lar majors of the graduating classes
of 2002 and 2003. These findings -
were not tested for significance.

In 2002, women were higher in
Biology, English, History, Math-
ematics, Political Science, and Psy-
chology, while men had a higher
average in Economics. In 2003,
women were higher in Biology, Eco-
nomics, English, History, Psychol-
ogy, and Religion, while men were
higher in Political Science.

departments.

Sachs first emphasized the diffi-
culty in quantifying the evaluation
process in a literature class, and the
resulting grade, an easier task for dis-
ciplines that are more right-or-
wrong than the humanities, such as
math and the natural sciences.

said. “We get a print-out sometime
during the following semester of my
grades compared to my colleagues.”
He said the department chair has
indicated to him his grading 4n the
past two years is not out of line with
others in the French department, and
Sachs indicated if that were the case
it might be communicated to him.

Smith said, “Ihave discussed grad-
ing issues with several of my col-
leagues, but I have never been ‘in-
fluenced’ in a negative way by any
of my colleagues...

“[T]here has never been any pres-
sure placed on me to hit a ‘grade tar-
get,’ and there has never been any
‘advice’ given in the form of an un-
stated ‘requirement.’”

But Sachs recalled that during his
initial orientation that Ross told all
new faculty “to challenge our stu-
dents.” Sachs said, “I believe that
came in the same breath as don’t in-
flate grades.”

In giving an “unsupported opin-
ion,” Smith said, “The problem with
the current system [at other schools],
though, is that you have inflation
combined with a ‘price ceiling’ of
sorts,” using Economics jargon for

Does major impact GPA?
Some departments have come to
acquire a reputation for being more
difficult than others, or at least hav-
ing a lower GPA. Math, Economics,
the natural sciences, and Religion are
frequently counted by students
among these majors. Ross would not
confirm or deny if the data supported
these perceptions.
Ross said, “I think that [a
department’s average GPA] can be
“misleading. It can relate to the struc-
ture of the major.” He explained that
a department’s average GPA may be
low while the same is not true of its
majors, largely because the material
in introductory-level courses may
produce a disparity of grades.

“This, in my mind, is a huge prob-
lem.”

Speaking from his teaching expe-
rience as a graduate student at Yale,
Sachs said, “Despite all the statistics,
I’m not convinced that a grade infla-
tion problem exists” to the degree
some alarmists claim, even at the Ivy
League schools.

“In my own classroom, a grade
evaluates the work and communi-
cates something to the student,”
Sachs said.

On'that basis, Ross declined to re-
lease the data the Academic Affairs
office maintains on departmental
GPA, saying it would not be appro-
priate.

- “In the end, it’s not departments,
it’s individuals that give grades,”
Ross said.

Vagt said, “I really think that ev-
ery faculty member oughtto have the
right to grade as they see fit. I do
realize that doesn’t happen in a
vacuum.”
