Admission Applicants:

Decline From Last Year‘

By KERN PARKER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Applications for admission to
next year’s Freshman Class to-
taled 1,053 as of Feb. 1, accord-
ing to Director of Admissions
H. Edmunds White.

This total is 147 fewer than
the number of high school sen-
fors who had applied at this
time last year.

White stated that college of-
ficials are not concerned about
the declining number of appli-
cations. “We're concerned with
quality, not quantity,” he re-
marked, ‘‘and this year we have
received quite a few excellent
applications. We'll start to worry
when the quality of applications
begins to decline.”

He added that the decline is
dargely the result of receiving
fewer ‘‘weak” applications, a

trend which he attributes in
some degree to improved high
school guidance counseling.

“High school counseling is im-
proving all the time,’’ he noted,
‘tand counselors are probably
beginning to recommend that
less-qualified boys not apply to
Davidson.”

The deadline for applications
is February 15, and all entrance
material (test scores, tran-
scripts, etc.) must be received
by the college by March 1. All
accepted and rejected appli-
cants will be notified on April
14.

In past years, a large per-
centage of those accepted were
notified around the middle of
February, but this year college
officials decided to discontinue
this practice.

“Before this year we were

On NSA Affiliation

Davidson's Young Republicans
wilt present a debate Monday
night on the pros and cons of
the college's affiliation with the
National Student Association.

The meeting will be held at
7 p.m. in the Morrison Room of
the College Union.

A YRC spokesman told THE:
DAVIDSONIAN that the club
hoped to clarify the college's
status as a NSA member.

“Ii seems that every couple
of years in recent times some-
one on campus has questioned
the wisdom of Davidson's affilia-
tion with NSA. This issue is stir-
ring once again.”’ he said.

During the .year 1963-64, sev-
eral members of the student

When asked if he had anything}

operating in the dark,”’ said
White. All of the applications
that we receive should be com-
pared with each other. This new
system allows us to do a more
careful and fair job and gives
us a better chance to balance
the class.”

White commented that this
system occasionally puts pres-
sure on an applicant who is ac-
cepted by another college and is
required to commit himself be-
fore he hears from Davidson.
In such a case. White said, the
student should contact David-
son, and officials will tell him
if they possibly can whether or
not he will be accepted.

White noted that it is difficult
for the college to decide just
how many applicants to accept
in order to get a class of a par-
ticular size. ‘‘We usually figure

, that 65 to 69 per cent of the boys

that we accept will come here,”
he said. This compares favor-
ably .with Harvard, which leads
all colleges in this category with

about 75 per cent.”’ *

White urged all Davidson stu-

dents to contact and to encour-

age to apply for admission any

boy whom they think might be
interested in Davidson. He also
stated that the admissions of-
fice welcomes written recom-
mendations of any boy who has
already applied.

MRS. SCHNEIDER AND SON CONRAD MIX BATTER
They Turn Out 40 To 50 Cakes Per Month

m Cakes Gre

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Does the name Mrs. E. C.
Schneider mean anything to
you? It should. It's not a bad
bet that she made the last birth-
day cake you ate.

Mrs. Schneider, a fairly re-
cent arrival in Davidson, lives
not far from campus, on Main
Street. When this reporter ar-
rived for an interview, he was
greeted and ushered in by her
young son, Conrad, who turned
out to be quite a character in
his own right.

His mother began her business
of making “Goody Boxes’ for
students just last year. Asked
how the cake-making enterprise
came about she explained, ‘‘We
used to live in Charlotte. When
I realized I had little Conrad
here to rear, we moved to Dav-
idson, because we love the vil-
lage life. The idea of making
cakes just came to my mind.”

She added that she wanted to
do something that would allow

In announcing the appropria-

splendid grant, although not a
part of our Ford Challenge Pro-

in encouraging our faculty and
in underwriting the cost of pro-
grams to enrich the educational
experience of our students dur-
ing these campaign years.”

“The trustees of the Duke En-
dowment,”’ he said, “‘have again
demonstrated by this appropria-
tion their understanding of spe-
cific educational areas where
Davidson seriously needs oper-
ating funds in order to continue

its progress as a leader in lib- |.

eral arts education.”

her to work at home.

Cooking as a money-making
proposition was something new
she said. ‘‘I had been an interior
decorator. This cake-baking idea
was really kind of a joke with
us."

Many of her recipes were
given to her by friends, along
with advice on the care and
feeding of hungry college stu-
dents.

“We've had a lot of fun doing
it, though,’’ Mrs. Schneider ad-
mitted. “The mothers are de-
lightful: Most of them have writ-
ten a personal letter instead of
just returning the form letter
I sent out. I guess this is an
indication of what kind of fam-
ilies the young men come from.”

Mrs. Schneider turns out about
40 to 50 cakes each month.
Business is generally pretty
steady, without a real peale sea-
son. “I have the work sched-
uled so I can get it done in the
course of a month," she ex-
plained. ‘There is no set day for
delivery unless a parents asks
for it, as with a birthday.”

Her cakes and cookies are al-
ways welcomed by students. One

Officers
To Take
New Oath

Student Body President Bill
Council will administer the new
oath of office to the members of
the Student Council and the
Honor Court at Tuesday's as-
sembly.

The swearing-in ceremony
originally scheduled for the last
assembly _ before semester
exams, was postponed due to the
absence of several members.

The new oath makes the Stu-
dent Council and Honor Court
duty bound to enforce the stu-
dent body regulations. They had
previously been honor bound to
enforce. these regulations. This
change, recommended by Honor
Court member John Burks, was
approved in December by the
Student Council.
