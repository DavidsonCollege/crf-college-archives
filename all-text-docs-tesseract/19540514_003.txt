FRIDAY, MAY 14, 1054

Davidson has made
tremendous strides in
the athletic world in
the past months, as the
Southern Conference
golf and tennis cham-
_plonships this spring
. indicate. Another win
could possibly come
this weekend in track.
_ One phase of the ath-

letic program is not
keeping pace. with the
progress of the other
sports. We have a new
| gymnasium with all
’ modern facilities, our

tennis courts are s@
fine that they are the scene of the Southern Conference Tennis
Tournament and the Southern Junior and Boys Tournament,
and so-on down the line. But the Davidson track facilities are
not on a par with those of the other sports. True, the track
situation has greatly improved in recent years, but much
work is still needed. The track has only four lanes on the
side of the track next to the East stands, and this does not
provide enough room for the runners in a large meet. When
Davidson’s opportunity comes to have the Southern Con-
ference Tournament on the campus, athletic officials must
decline the honor. There would simply not be enough room.

The present situation in the jumping events is another
point which could be improved without much trouble. As it
is now, two adjoining pits serve for the pole vault, the high
jump and the broad jump. It is very disconcerting to visiting
teams who are not used to it. For example, a Central broad-
jumper forfeited one of his jumps because he had to stop
when a high-jumper landed in the pit just before the broad-
jumper prepared to leave the ground. It is only one of many
complaints. Many vaulters from visiting schdols have com-
plained that the pole which holds the public address speaker
is too close to the runway. It forms a psychological barrier for
vaulters who have not gotten used to it. This could be easily
corrected by moving the pits to other places on the field.

These improvements would cost a considerable amount,
but the prestige of the school would be increased, and it would
be worth the money in the long run. The athletic office is
definitely in favor of the changes, and the go-ahead from the
administration is all that remains in the way.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Meet Ends Davidson
Spring Sports Card

Coach Whittle’s varsity track team is in Blacksburg, Va.,
this weekend, representing Davidson in the annual Southern
Conference track meet. Action was to be run in the track and
field events today and tomorrow, with the winner being
announced tomorrow afternoon.

Both the freshman and varsity
track teams wound up the season
in winning style, adding another
notch to the list of victorious years.
Coach Whittle’s tracksters turned
in a record of four wins and no
defeats, placing second in two tri-
angular meets. On the list of beat-
en foes were Mercer, Washington
and Lee, N.C. State, and Furman.

High scoring honors at the end
of the regular season go to Phil
Koonce, who has racked up 106%
points, while still having the con-
ference meet to add to his total.
Billy Shipley is second with 52%,
and Frank Mitchener is third with
4%.

In the Jast encounter of the
season, with the N. C. State Wolf-
pack, the Wildcats trounced the
Atlantic Coast Conference team by
the score of 86% to 41%. Led by
Phil Koonce, who took first place
in the 100 and 220-yard dashes and
placed second in the broad jump
for 13 points, Davidson completely
dominated both the track and the
field events, taking 11 of the 15
first places and 11 second places.

VMI and VPI are the strong
teams to watch in the conference
meet this weekend at Blacksburg.
Jobnny Mapp will lead the VMI
team as it fights for first place
honors, and VPI could show up
very well against the Cadets. Right
behind the two Virginia teams on
many prediction lists are the Wild-
cats, and a good day could see them
in a second place spot.

The freshmen ended the regu-
lar season with a record of five
wins and one loss. Leading the
team in scoring were Pete Ash-
craft, Bill Gramley and Roswell
Mallory, in that order. Ashcraft
finished with 768% points, nosing
out Gramley who had 70, while
Mallory had 56%. A great deal
of credit is due to the two coaches,
Sam Magill and Carroll Hambright,
who worked with the team, Ham-
bright coaching the field events
and Magill coaching the track

The freshman baseball team had
a brief season as a result of three
games being rained out, but four
games were played and three of
them won. Victories were gained
over Salisbury High School, Hard-
ing of Charlotte, and the strong
Kannapolis Y team, after suffering
an earlier defeat from the latter.
Dick Belton was perhaps the out-
standing player, for, as the number
one pitcher he worked 34 innings,
striking out 57, while yielding only
16 hits.

Belton, infielders Dyke Little,
Don Comer, Bob Campbell, out-
tielders Lyle Liewellyn, Jim West,
Don McRee and catcher Ken Law-
ing should see action on the var-
sity squad next year. ;

The freshmen golf team,
coached by athletic director Paul
Scott, played seven matches against
some of the toughest opposition in
the state and was unable to gain
a victory. The team suffered tre-
menduously from the loss of Rus-
sef Barringer, Buster Jenkins, and
Ed Bell, all of whom were in-
eligible. Two matches were played
with N.C. State. A second match
with State was scheduled for last
Tuesday but was postponed. Stuart
Vaughn, George Scott, Bob Arm-
field, Dan LaFar, Tom Brewer,
Fred Teal, and John Maltsby car-
ried the load for Coach Scott's
linksters.

The freshman tennis team, while
defeating North High and losing
two matches to Myers Park of
Charlotte, uncovered some boys
who should strengthen Coach Me
Kee’s Southern Conference cham-
pious next spring. John Thorpe and
John Robinson were undefeated in
doubles play, and Thorpe won all
of his singles matches this season
in the number one spot. Following
him were Robinson in the number
two position, Tom Lee, Carl Cooper,
Huger King, and J, C. Winfrey.

Cat Baseballers End
Improved Season

Davidson's varsity baseball] team
has completed its 1954 season, and
the season’s record is definitely an
improvement over last year’s mark.
Coach Chuck Clements’ boys have
come a long way and appear to be
on the road to better times next
season,

The Wildcats finished the cur-
rent card last Saturday at Lexing-
ton, Va., against VMI. It was a
rough weekend in the Cavalier
state. They lost decisions to both
VPI and VMI by lopsided scores.
The losses dropped the Cats to
seventh place in the Southern Con-
ference, but the action of other
teams this week may put them
higher in the standings by the time
that final results are posted.

The Cats won but five contests
this season, but the wins included
decisions over the semi-professional
McCrary Eagles and The Citadel's
fine team. Next season, with the
help of the freshmen, the base-
ballers should break even for the
first timé in many years.

events. The team was led by such
outstanding performers as Bill
Gramley, who after setting records
in the discus and shot putt in the
IFC meet, was undefeated in these
two events. Pete Ashcraft was un-
defeated in the mile, and Roswell
Mallory did not lose a 440-yard
dash or an 880-yard run. John
Robison was undefeated in the
high jump in regular season com-
petition. Such top-flight performers
should bolster varsity ranks for
Coach Whittle next spring.

With many lettermen returning
to the varsity squads next year
and with the added strength and
depth from this year’s freshman
teams, Davidson can look to a
brighter future in athletics.

Spring Frosh Teams
End Successful Season

Davidson's freshman teams have completed a successful
season in spring sports, and many frosh players have shown
enough skill to assure varsity play next season.

All-Frafernity Team

Named for Volleyball]

The AllFraternity Volleyball
Team has been selected by the
representative vote of all frater-
nities. The results were tabulated
by Track Coach A. Heath Whittle,

Phifer and Larry Champion of the
Phi Gams were chosen, and the
SPEs placed Vince Gould and Lee

One of the most oustanding
freshman track teams to run the
cinder paths in recent Davidson
history was coached by Carroll
Hambright and Sam Magill this
spring. The frosh thinclads com-
piled an impressive 6-1 record,
boasting wins over Myers Park,
North and East High Schools in a
quadrangular meet, and Charlotte
Central, Asheville School, Lees-
McRae, and Lenoir Rhyne College
in dual meets. The only loss was
at the hands of Mars Hill Junior
College.

Davidson’s golf and tennis teams have brought the
Southern Conference championships to the campus in the big-
gest step in Davidson athletic prominence in several years.

Davidson, led by lefty Lacy
Keesler, entered a three-day battle
last weekend with high hopes of

bringing the championship cup
back to the Davidson campus for
the first time in four years. During

“I this period of time, the title was

held by the tennis forces from
North Carolina. The victory on Sat-
urday also marked the first cham-
pionship for Coach Dick McKee,
the former Rice Institute and Uni-
versity of Miami (Florida) tennis
star.

As it was, unseeded Corky Clark
and first-sceded Lacy Keesler
moved in an -easy fashion. Leigh-
ton Green, however, went three
sets in upsetting his sixth-seeded
teammate, Johnny Bremer. The
only other player to reach the semi-
finals was Furman’s Cordell Mad-
dox. On Saturday morning, Kees-
ler moved into the finals by
trouncing Maddox, 7-5, 6-2, 6-1. In
the other bracket, teammates Clark
and Green squared off, with the
former coming out with a smash-
ing victory, 6-0, 6-1, 6-0.

The finals saw a nip-and-tuck
battle between Corky Clark and
Lacy Keesler. Clark gave Keesler
a great match, battling for each
point and extending the match to
four sets. Keesler won, 6-4, 46, 9-7,
6-4.

The doubles championship also
saw two Davidson teams battle it
out for the trophies. The seeded
team of Keesler and Bremer met
defeat when they matched rackets
with fellow Davidsonians, George
Snead and Corky Clark. The scores
in the stunning upset were 3-6, 8-6,
6-2, 7-5.

Resulls Are To Be
Announced Monday

The annual Interfraternity race
will draw to a close Monday, when
Coach Whittle will announce the
winner. The close race between
the Phi Delts and the Betas is still
undecided, though the Phi Delts
definitely have the inside track to
the championship. Everyone else
is out of the running. The Kappa
Sigs are currently in third place,
followed by the Sigma Chis. But it
is definitely a two-team race. The
Phi Delts have held a 50-point
lead for several months, and it
seems that the Betas must make
approximately that gain in var-
sity competition if they are to over-
take the leaders.

been a banner year for Coach Dick
McKee and the new Southern Con-
ference tennis champions, the
Davidson Wildcats.

The golfers, though not having
the low-score man in the field,
carried off the championship cup.
Joe Jenkins was runner-up to Bill
Wood of VMI in individual play,
but since team score was based on
the performance of each team’s top
four men, Davidson edged William
