hight-College Exchange
Offered Next Semester

October 10 is the deadline
for applications from those
interested in participating in
the college exchange  pre-
gram during the second se-
mester.

Director of Instructional
Development Jay H. Ostwalt
reports that his office is open
for any information and ap-
propriate forms for any stu-
dent who would like to take
part in the program after
Christmas.

Ostwalt said that he was
primarily interested in jun-
ior students, but that young-
er underclassmen may also

apply.

The new change is that the
eight colleges involved in the
exchange consortium will ac-
cept students in the middle
of the year despite discrep-
ancies in the academic cal-
endar.

Only Davidson and Wash-
ington & Lee operate on
a calendar of three terms.
Hampden-Sydney, Mary Bald-
win, and Randolph-Macon
Woman's College have two
semesters in their year, but
Hollins, Randolph-Macon and
Sweet Briar have instituted
the 4-1-4 program.

Ostwalt said that an ad-
justment could be made for
a Davidson student transfer-
ring to one of the other
schools operating on another
academic calendar,

The adjustment would con-
sist of an extended studies
program linked with the oth-
er college semester to pro-
vide an equivalent half-year
program.

Presently there are 11 co-
eds from the various girls’
schools and two men from
Hampden-Sydney participat-
ing in the exchange at Da-
vidson.
