“The Man With The Golden Rules”

By FRANK BLOODWORTH

Jerry Helms, Senior, may well
go down in the history of David-
son College as “The Man With!

the Golden Rules, the Silent
Movies, and the Silver Offering |
Plates.” |

Without Jerry’s tireless service
to Davidson, the basketball team
would never have anyone to tuck
them snugly in their beds at night,
students would never get to see
the almost extinct phenomena of
silent movies, and those who at-
tend Vespers would have nowhere
to deposit their offerings, a sad
plight in the mind of any David
son gentleman. ‘i

Jerry has served for the past
two years as head manager of the
basketball team. In this capacity
he has been forced to accompany
the team on many long trips
thus unfortunately missing numer-
ous days of school.

Last Tuesday evening Jerry had
the pleasure of retiring Hobby
Cobb’s jersey, and with equal pride |
and a great deal more pleasure he |
also retired his own striped man-
ager’s shirt, to be preserved along |
with Hobby’s for posterity.

As co-chairman of the Union
Film Committee, Jerry helps to

pick out the films that most people |

have already seen or don’t want
to see, that most likely have no
sound, and that will
break during the showing. But be-
ing in charge of admissions has
its advantages, Jerry when
you can let your professors in to
see the pictures free.
