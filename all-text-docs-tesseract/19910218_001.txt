Davidson Finds
National Review’ S

Ranking Favorable _

By Sean Lind

Last week, William F.
Buckley’s The National Review
named Davidson as one of the top
fifty liberal arts Colleges in the
nation. Because of the criterion
used by The Review, however, there
has been much debate on the issue.

Administrators and students have ~

_ expressed Concern that the recog-

nitionisa reflection of Davidson’s |

antiquated traditions, rather than
an affirmation of the school’s pro-
gressive excellence.

The Davidsonian conducted a
random phone survey of 100 stu-

dents to find out how they felt ;

about Davidson’s ranking.
Some students expressed con- -

cern about the ranking. Senior. -
Ellen Ott commented, "I was not’

surprised by the ranking, but I was
disappointed by the criterion that
they used. A Jot of the Bases Wie
The Review felt were negative, |
see as: leAjuraseas of Davidson's
progress.”

‘Themajority of students, how-
ever, felt that the recognition was

positive. Sophomore Kyle Kinner
stated "Regardless of its political

intent, the article reflected us ina _

positive light and gave us some
constructive criticism."

This survey was compiled with
the help of David Thompson and
Tom Koonce:

Kuykendall Discusses The Past,
Present and Future Of Davidson

By Mark Puckett and Jay
Chaudhuri

On January 24, The Davidsonian
interviewed President Kuykendall
to discuss various issues regard-
ing Davidson.

Davidsonian: You just got back
from New York. What were you
doing there?

Kuykendall: Trying toraise money
for Davidson College. Chrono-

_ logically, our campaign is in its

early-to-mid phase. We are spend-
ing some time now following up
on some good things that have
happened--saying “thank you” to
some and trying to keep the proc-
ess going with other potential
donors. The campaign is a major
preoccupation for me right now. I
imagine that every stage is critical,
but we have reached the half way
point, and Toby Bethea and others
keep telling me that the last sev-
enty-five million is the hardest
{laughs}.

Athletics.
Davidsonian: . How do you feel
about the NCAA meeting at the
beginning of the year?
Kuykendall: In a general way it
expressed, at least for the time
being, the seriousness of the inten-

tion to bring about “reform” in two
areas, neither one of which sub-
stantially impact Davidson’s cur-
rent program. One is referred to as
“cost containment,” and the sec-
ond is what they call “mainstream-
ing.” Both terms give me some
problems, though in both instances
Iexpect that for certain institutions
those goals are necessary and laud-
able. They’re not very applicable
to Davidson’s day-to-day concerns.

Davidsonian: In your opinion is it
still possible for a school this size
toattain high athletic achievement
on the basis of what we see, say, in
basketball in other schools such as
Duke and Carolina?

Kuykendall: \t’s possible in some
areas. I think significant accom-
plishment is possible with the
exception of football. Still, fora
school Davidson’s size, the kind of
success enjoyed in men’s basket-
ball twenty years ago is a difficult
thing toenvision in today’s changed
environment. Certainly, in areas
where we have had traditional
strength, and I think we’:.ve demon-
strated this fall, for example, that
we can notonly be competitive but
be successful. I don’t know that
that’s a permanent situation, but
it’s demonstrable that there is that
opportunity. This is probably not

dependant on divisional status,
though that’s a piece of it. We are
geographically and historically
involved in Division I with few
immediate options to do otherwise.
One wonders if the competition
would be any easier at a lower
division.
Davidsonian: Well, is the invita-
tion back into the Southern Con-
ference just a pipe dream? Or is it
a plausibility? Why have they
invited us back? 3
Kuykendall: 1 think the reasons
they’ ve invited us back are internal
to the Southern Conference--to rep-
resent a desire the conference has
for balance and expansion: ambi-
tions from their vantage, plausible
ambitions. Our departure from the
Southern Conference, as youknow,
was not of our own choosing, and
I would think ourrcturn to it--if it
werc to take place--would have to
take place on our terms, which
perhaps would not match up with
the terms they seem to espouse.
The attraction is to traditional
rivals: Furman, Citadel, VMI--
schools that were in the “old”
Southern Conference. But
Davidson has done a great deal of
moving in recent years, and I think

Plans For New Residence Halls In
Martin Court Released

By Ross Sloop

In an effort to grapple with
Davidson’s overcrowding problem
the school plans to construct anew
senior apartment building. This
new building is designed to have
four floors which would include a
basement.

The basement would accomo-
date a couple of suites as well as a
spacious laundry and a large meet-
ing room.

“Hopefully this laundry will

hold about six washers and: six”

dryers. The meeting room should

~ accomadate close to fifty people,”

says director ofresidencelife Rich-
ard Terry.
~The basic style of the new

building willbe the sameas theold -

apartments. It will house 56 stu-
dents in 14 suites designed for
groups of four individuals. Adding

the 56 extra senior beds will bring ©

the number of students being
housed in apartments to about 200.
Costs for the construction have

not yet been determined. Various |

firms will submit bids for the con-
tract on March 15. Whatever con-

' tracting firm offers to build for the
lowest price gets the contract.
- “Tcan’timagine it Costing less.

than 1 million or more than 2 mil-

lion,” says Terry.

So, when will itbe ready? This
is the question that seniors who
wantto put their lottery numbers in
for the new apartment will be ask-
ing. i
Littleand Associates architects
as wellas Davidson’s physical plant
administrators hope that it will be
ready for returning students in the
middle of August. The Residence
Life Office however can make no

guarantees.
“I want to be as fair and
straightforward as possible,” says

- Richard Terry.

“Having the eperenenis ready
by the middle of August is an
ambitious but feasible project. But
there’s achance that they won’t be
ready, and some seniors will have
todeal with some temporary hous-
ing for awhile. I guess we’ll find
out who the gamblers are.”
