DR. AND MRS. T. O. PINKERTON
First Junior Year Advisers To Germany Reminisce

Pinkerton Describes
Pioneer Year Abroad

One year and two weeks ago,
Dr. and Mrs. T. O. Pinkerton
were spending perhaps the most
beautiful and memorable Christ-
mas of their lives.

They were in Nurmberg, Ger-
man city of the Kristkindel, a
traditional Christmas fair.

“I can still smell the cookies
and spices and steaming wurst
cooking, and see the displays of
toys and dolls of all kinds,”
Said Dr. Pinkerton, associate
professor of German, in his of-
fice-on the Davidson campus.

The Pinkertons were in Ger-
many with the group of David-
son students who pioneered the
Junior Year Abroad program at

the University of Marburg. Pink-
erton was academic advisor to
the boys.

“Most of my time during the
school sesion was spent in an
advisor’s capacity, as well as
preparing lectures and the gen-
eral administrative work which
was so important in that first
year.”

Pinkerton was very impres-
sed at the performance of the
students under his charge.
“They were very serious in
their work,"’ he said, ‘‘much
more than they had been at
Davidson."’

Besides their regular classes,
he continued, the boys became

After the famous riot last
year, one.of the janitors
said in his usual distilled
manner, “1 don’t know why
they rever listen to you up
there on the hill. Without
the students there wouldn't
be any school!”

As basic as this question
seems, it: is rarely aired at
Davidson but pervades the aca-
demic atmosphere here at Phil-
lips University without requiring
consideration,

This article is not designed
for the. sole purpose of hammer-
ing at the revered acrolith of
our alma mater and is written
with an awareness of problems
originating from size and lack
of funds.

‘However, several of the me-
tnods practiced here may en.
cotirage thought in those stu-
denis who are not totally satis-
fed with a high school environ-
ment and will at least promote
the Junior Year Abroad Pro-
gram as an opportunity to dis-
cover what the: air smells like
outside the walls of the six
o'clock bell.

The professor, like all other
wage earners in a structured
soziety, is’ paid a specific sum
to perform a special task, in this
case to offer knowledge of his
field to those who are interested
enough to pay for it. Here in
Marburg the professor does ex-
actly that. and does not concern
himself, unless asked, with the
social, religicus or moral life of
the student.

His public working hours are
posted in the catalogue. and he
appears on stage without roll
book, unconcerned with attend-
ance, and proceeds to do his
job. The student is given a study
book, in which up to fifty hours
can be listed without paying
more than the original fee. After
a month of visiting as many

interested in such fields as his-
tory or art, music and foreign
affairs and pursued that interest
on their own time.

Pinkerton reported that they
also were very active in extra-
curriculars. ‘“‘Dave Orr and
Jack Goodykoontz played bas-
ketball for the university team,
Charles Turner sang with a
choral group and John Good
even ran an American-style
campaign for office, and won.”

The Pinkertons themselves
found time during the Christmas
and spring vacations to do some
traveling and sight-seeing of
their own. Spending Christmas
in Nurmberg was “unforget-
able” for them, said Pinkerton.

“We arrived on Christmas Eve
and. it had started to snow, It
was beautiful, with no neon
lights and small, snow-covered
streets that looked like a picture
out of Dickens."

Pinkerton added that he and
his wife were surprised at the
number of alumni who would
turn up to visit them. “Most of
them -were in the Army, as Don
Saunders (°62) and Dudley Sal-
ley ('63). Sometimes it looked as
if we were having a real reun-
ion.”

In the spring, the Pinkertons
traveled to the French and Ital-
ian Riviera. Florence, Rome,

- Capri and on to Vienna. Before

returning to the U.S. late in the
summer, they visited Berlin,
Copenhagen and Paris.

“It was a wonderful experi-
ence,”’ he concluded, ‘‘especially
because of the way the boys

’. handled themselves on_ their

own. I think they gained a great
deal from it."

NO WRITS, REVIEWS
Junior Praises German

classes as the student wishes,
this book is submitted to the re-
gistrar.

It is processed and returned
by mail to the student, who then
has only the professors, of those
courses he wishes to formally at-
tend, sign the book, thereby. ver-
ifying his attendance for at least
one session,

This eliminates the problem
of blindly deciding which five
courses to take in a semester, or
the bothersome protess of drop-
ping a course before completely
discovering its potential.- Within
such a system, auditing a course
simply means going at the ap
pointed time.

Unless desired. the interaction
between student and professor
is limited to the rapping of
knuckles on the desk top when
the class begins, and again at
the end. There are no writs to
waste time. and very few pro-
fessors rely on questioning the
audience as a device to hide a
lack of preparation.

These methods, used in high
school because the student was
forced by the state and social
pressures to attend. become ob
solete in a community of in-
dividuals paying for an educa-
tion. It is evident that a per-
centage of the buyers do not
accept the benefits of what they
pav for. but they are given the
right to suffer for themselves
when the [nal tests come.

Not only is the use of writs
and class room questioning an
insult to the diligent student who
could be using the same time
pursuing independent research,
but it is also beneath the profes-
sor who expects the student, so
grilled by a high school educa-
tion as to be accepted by the
university, to be capable of ful-
filling his responsibility to him-
self.

This responslbility includes de-
tecting the fields of interest most
suited to his potential and neg-

lecting a secondary subject for
extra hours in the former. In
short, the only mother the stu-
dent has is left safely at home.

IT remember the professors at
Davidson who commented that
to participate in the Junior Year
Abroad Program was to be an
intellectual vagabond and those
professors who said we might
learn something, but it would not
be academic.

It seems in retrospect that

PART OF INITIATION

‘Schlagen’ Is An Integral Part
Of Fraternity Life In Germany

By SAM SMITH
Davidson Junior Abroad

There are about 33 fra-
ternities or Verbindungen
in Marburg to which about
one quarter of thé male stu-
dent body belongs.

The Verbindungen are usually
local with no national organiza-
tion.

They are not as similar to one
other as American fraternities
are, Depending on the origin of

the Verbindungen, it is classified |

as a Landsmanschaft. Burschen-
schaft, Sangerschaft,
schaft or Corps; and {t acquires
the name of a political area or
folk group such as ‘Corps Has-
so-Barussia” (Hessian-Prussen).

One aspect of the Verbindun-
gen which is not found in Ameri-
can fraternities is Schlagen.

something like fencing. In this ,;
‘ritual’ two members of differ- ;
ent Verbindungen must fight ;

each other.

Schlagen is similar to fencing,
but heavier swords about aa

meter long are used. The op- .
ponents face each other with one i

arm behind the back and ‘with
padding everywhere except the
head. There is also protection

for the eyes, nose and cheek. |

Formerly only eye protection
was allowed, and many old fra-
ternity men have hideous scars
on their faces which stand as

evidence to their participation. |

Now the cuts are rarer and not
so severe. as earlier,

Schlagen is compulsory in
Corps, Landsmanchaften, Bur-
schenschaften and Turnenschaf-
ten but voluntary in any other
Verbindungen. Usually a student
must schlag at least twice: once
to become an active member
and another to become inactive.

The duel between two fellows
Jasts either a certain length of
time or until one is cut, One
doesn’t get any credit if he
moves around, ducks or utters a
word during the duel.

Organizationally, the Verbin-
dungen are similar to frater-
nities. There is no national or-
ganization, and because the
Verbindungen are hurting for
members, there is no strict rush
ordeal. If a fellow wants to join
a group, he is usually accepted.

There are fraternity houses
where brothers eat and some-
times live. A student is a pledge
(Fux) for one or two semesters,
a Brother (Bursch) for several
years and acquires inactive

System

four years at Davidson is a
choice between intellectual or
social hibernation, shielded by
the long-tattered blanket of re-
putation.

This is because if the student
finishes preparing for writs or
reviews in time to pursue in-
dependent study, he becomes a
winged nomad, shifting between
the marching boys in green at
the bottem of the, hill and the
bell ringing in black at the top.

for the final exam.

The alumni support their
group relatively well, thus al-
lowing very inexpensive board
and moderate fees. ‘Big broth-
ers," “pledge masters’ and
other aspects are similar to US
fraternities.

One of the main functions of
the Verbindungen is drinking.

The first Sunday morning I
was in Marburg I attended the
service at the University Church
and was lucky enough to find a
seat.

The church is beautiful, im-
pressive and big, however, about
six people had to stand through-
out the service. The church
could be enlarged with difficulty,
but it seems to me that an easier
solution to the problem would
be to make attendance com-
pulsory while allowing four ab-
sences. Then everyone would
miss four services; therefore,
the church wouldn't be over-
crowded any one Sunday.

The preacher was a really old
professor, and I couldn't under-
stand all he was saying. His ser-
mon dealt with Jonah and the
whale. Most of the sermons
about the indigestible Jonah that
I had heard in America hadn’t
been very exciting, so I didn’t
mind day-dreaming, a little. Aft-

around 2 or 3 in the morning.
I've heard that you really
don’t see many totally drunk
Germans. You've just got to
wait long enough. In each fra-
ternity house there is a chest
high sink with grips on the wall.
The most significant aspect of
the social life here is the female
35 per cent of the student body.
The proximity of girls where
you're studying makes them not
such a big deal as at Davidson,
and it doesn't take seven hours
of traveling and planning for a

three hour date. Also, it be-
comes possible to think of a
girl as a human companion.

At Davidson the occasions
where you meet the fairer group
are manufactured. Here on the
other hand, some fellows allow
their girl friends to fix Sunday
lunch in the dorm, and one can
do such unadorned and unrom-
antic things as go swimming
between classes.

I don’t think that one can
make significant generalizations
as to how the German girls out

erwards, however, a_ theology
student explained that the
preacher had interpreted the
miracle in terms of modern the-
ology and had “‘of course not”
used the story in its literal
meaning.

The university church holds a
service for the university stu-
dents one Sunday followed by a
service for the town people
which doesn’t involve Biblical
criticism the next Sunday.

The next Sunday the Protest-
ant group sponsored a greeting
program. A professor lectured
on academic freedom, hinting
strongly that teachers - should
have a little more authority.
After the speeech a girl student
stood up and said his talk hadn’t
been academic at all. |

Then other students joined
the debate, arguing heatedly
either for or against, but mainly
against, the teacher, none of
whom worried about sacrificing
his grade if the teacher was of-
fended.

rank the American ones, or vice
versa. Perhaps in being naive,
however, the German girls fall
far behind.

Social functions are sponsored
by the fraternities, student as-
semblies like the World Univer-
sity Service, confessional groups
and dormitories. There seem to
be some fraternities who em-
phasize social life, but several
fraternity members felt that
most fraternity activities in
Marburg were not intended for
girls.
