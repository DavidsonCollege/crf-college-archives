Youssef K. Abagui

The Egyptian revolution of 1952
which resulted in the expulsion of the
king and royalty, brought a team of
army officers who had led the
revolution, into the political scene.
Nasser and Sadat were two of the
fourteen officers who led the revolu-
tion.

After numerous intrigues Nasser
became President of Egypt. New to
the political scene and being an army
officer with a limited perspective in
this new field, he set out on big
projects which most Egyptians, to-
day think, is what led Egypt into its
present misery and squalor.

Nasser was a charismatic figure
with a strong personality. His very
sons report that it was hard to look
into his eyes. His enemies dreaded it.

Nasser’s regime was infested with
intrigues and corruption. He nationa-
lized all the large land holdings,
factories, and private enterprises.
Instead, he appointed his favorites in
key posts. This was fatal to the newly
developing industrial area; army of-
ficers who knew very little besides
using a gun were now appointed as
heads of industiral plants. The latter

also coming from lower middle class
families saw that it was a great
chance for them to improve their
economic lot, and therefore major
embezzlements took place. The econ-
omy was heading for a drop.

In the first years of the revolution
Nasser sought the help and allegiance
of the United States. When he
presented the United States with a
large and extravagant project, of
building a dam, that cost billions, The
United States, after having studied
the project rejected it. Nasser took
the blow personally and took refuge in
the Soviets who were more than
willing to sponsor a ten year project.

Today, the high dam is useless. It
was said that it would increase
agricultural land; it has not. It was
also said it would bring electricity in
villages, which have never seen a light
after sunset; it has not. In fact it
promised a lot more, but none of it
egme true. on the contrary the hight
dam has been very harmful to the
land--it retains all the alluvium that
the Nile brings in. Egypt’s crop, cot-
ton, has diminished because of the
lack of alluvium in the soil. Ancient
monuments that have stood in upper
Egypt for 5000 years have started to
corrode during these past 20 years
because of the high humidity level
caused by the dams’ water reservoirs.

The high dam amongst many other
projects was one constructed under
the pretext of personal prestige. The
poor Egyptian farmer today still pays
the price and.so will his sons for many
generations to come. Through the
sixties, Soviet influence wormed into
Egypt, until red was the dominant
color. Bith red came a well-estab-
lished dictatorship. The intellectual
class and the nobility fled, those who

Deck the halls, we all are

back--tis the season to be slack!

The freshman hall counselors evi-
dently are doing a very poor job of
informing the Class of ’81 of the
intricacies of the Davidson academic
year, because I actually overheard
some freshmen decline an invitation
to go to Monday night’s basketball
because they had to study.

Fortunately, the College Union
knows better. It realizes that the first
three-tenths of the winter term is in
actuality Davidson’s period of recess.
It therefore scheduled a dozen or so
“mini-courses’’ in various subjects
from belly-dancing to southern cook- -
ing to aid students in their efforts to
avoid work.

The response to the mini-courses
has been so good that I think it might
be interesting to schedule other
mini-courses in the spring when
people really want to-slacken up.
There is a whole spectrum of inte-
resting fields of study with an equally
wide range of talented staff and
faculty from whom the students could
learn much.

For instance, it would bea lot of
fun to offer a course in ‘‘Hide and
Seek.” After all, people do tend to get
playful in the spring and Davidson
students, with their compulsion for
excellence in areas of peer competi-
tion, would no doubt respond to a
course that taught the finer tech-
niques of the game. Originally, I
thought the the ladies at the College
Laundry should teach the course.
They certainly are uncanny with their
consistent ability to keep some of my
socks and underwear hidden forever.

However, an even better instructor
would be Dr. Hight of Davidson's
Student Counseling Center. Indeed, it
seems absurd to have instructors
whose main forte is the mere losing of
clothing, especially when someone is

lable who is capable of losing not

stayed and opposed the regime were
cut down. The peers and mass media
were controlled, censored and dicta-
ted from the hierarchy. A period of
brainwash took place; in schools, on
television, in mosques--all condemned
the United States--it had become the
root of all evil, the source of
imperialism. Radicalism was good.
On this basis, threats of throwing
the Jews into the sea were issued.
Nasser never thought how, why, or
with what.

Most of you have not experienced a
dictatorship where your mail, your
calls, your whole life is censored.
Where even geographical movement
is prohibited. To those who like
freedomyit is an agony!

The Russian supplied Nasser with
weapons. They also supplied the
experts that would operate them in
case of air atack or defense. This is on
of the reasons Sadat threw the
Soviets out of Egypt. He did not
particularly fancy the idea of consul-
ting the Russians before launching
any attack against Israel in 1967.
Especially bear in mind that Soviet
military intelligence knew what was
going to happen on the 5th of June
1967.

After 18 years of dominance they
were thrown out of their most
influential base in the Middle East,
Egypt. Throughout their stay the
Russians have never supplied Egypt
with offensive weapons to match
Israel’s power. As long as there was a
no peace no war situation, they were
too strong, wish the excuse of protec-
tion.

The Soviets intend to form a crucial
military line, and above all insure a
commercial basis for their poor quali-
ty industries. The area’s geographic

Farrell. Those around Farrell are well
aware (and I do mean well aware) of
his self-acclaimed high I.Q. It would
beso beneficial to the College
community for him to share some of
his enlightened philosophies. His
belief in the well-rounded student
athlete and understanding of a stu-
dent athlete’s need for diversity runs
so deep that he’s encouraged several
players, the running backs in particu-
lar, to quit Davidson Football if they
wish to pursue other sports.

Indeed, his players respect him so
much that whenever I ask them what
they feel about him, I never get any

“response because they get so choked

up with emotion they won’t speak.
What little response I do get indicates,
he is somewhat of a father-figure,
because he continually tells players to
keep their problems ‘‘in the family.”
A chance for Coach Farrell to share
his deep understanding of human
needs and diversity in a mine-course
should not be overlooked.

There are all kinds of other possibi-

lities. Dr. Spencer could teach a
seminar on ‘‘History of the Jewish
Labor Movement,’’ Peter Nicholls
could teach ‘‘Modern: Ballroom Dan

_ Soviets muddle peace prospects

access to the Red Sea, Indian Ocean
and Africa makes it more prone to
Soviet greed.

After their expulsion from Egypt

(the Mother Land of the Arab World)
the Soviets set out for other gullible
political systems in the Arab world.
' Lybia was one of the most succu-
lent systems, and the easiest to digest
whatever radical ideas the Soviets
were selling.

In Lybia a young colonel (Kadafi)
had a coup against the King while the
latter was on vatation. He was then
declared president. Kadafi preached
what Nasser had preached in the 60’s
so the Soviets saw in him a figure to
oppose Sadat.

Sadat had done the opposite of
what Nassar did. Instead of the
Soviets, Sadat opened Egypt to
further influences; instead of social-
ism, Sadat started free interprise. He
had overtly criticized the Soviets
throughout the Arab World and
ridiculed them, something Nasser
never considered doing.

The young colonel gave them
military bases on the Mediterranean,.
he brought in their experts to run his
army and industry. He also threw out
all the foriegners and only kept
Russians. I wonder if the oil rich
plutocracy of Lybia would benefit
more economically by-opening its
market to the whole world, or by only
confining itself to one monopoly? The
answer lies in who really gives the
orders!

In Syria the radical Baath party
rules. This party is as closely con-
nected to the Soviets as were ‘‘Nas-
ser’s Men” in Egypt. Their allegiance
was demonstrated lately when Sadat
decided to visit Israel; the Syrians
were alarmed by his decision. The
Syrian Prime Minister (Abdel Halim).
Khaddam flew tg the Soviet Union

with no foreplans of a visit. They
confessed and he returned. Syria
would not support Sadat in his effort
for peace. They called his move
“treason.’’ The Soviets called it ‘‘a
danger to peace.’’ (What peace?!)
Whatever the Russians condemn the
Syrians and Lybians echo as does the
PLO. The PLO, however, has always
been a small group who have no other
support than the Russians. They
supply the arms and also the situation
for their use. They-have the PLO fight
Lebanon and take over the southern
border facing Israel. To the Soviets it
is ideal to have more than two borders
in conflict, especially when one of
them is seeking an end to war, and the
fourth border (Jordan) is royalist and
will not tolerate the Soviets or their
radical economy.

By observing the peace talks today
between Egypt and Israel, we see that
the countries that oppose them most
are the Syrians, the Lybians, the PLO
and the Soviets!

They refuse to negotiate, they
refuse to understand although they all
stand a fair chance of negotiating and
recovering their (and above all,
achieving peace. But still, they do not
even want, to sit and listen. They
boycott the meetings instead! In
whose benefit is this war? Is it in the
favor of the thousands that die in
war? Is it in the interest of underde
veloped countries to invest their
incomes in weapons instead of using
their resources to feed their impover
ished and hungry people? Or is) it in
the interest of some third party that

can only live on corpses.
