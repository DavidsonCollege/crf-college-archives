THE DAVIDSONIAN,

OCTOBER 16,

STUDENTS HOLD
SPIRITED RALLY

Frosh Shirt-Tail Parade Climaxed
By Mammoth Pep
Meeting .

Seven-thirty Friday night, and old
Shearer rang with the shouts of all the
classes, impatient for the fire-works to
start. Then cheer-leader Joe Dees mount-
ed the platform, surrounded by his four
aides, and a hush descended on the hall

It was the unanimous opinion of the
rear half of the gathering that red caps
were not present in the desired numbers,
so, at the behest of leader Dees, upper
classmen scattered in every direction,
and soon this deficiency was repaired
Their numbers augmented by these new
comers, the Frosh entered into the spirit
of the occasion, until came the gladsome
news that a line would form on the out
side.

Here, led by runners with flares, be-+
gan the first shirt-tail parade of the sea-
son, Upper-classmen dodged behind trees
and each other to escape the coils of the
serpentine line which zig-zagged round
the “D” and broke up before the steps
of Chambers. Here were more yells, and
the singing of “O Davidson.”

College Program Given

Over WBT Last Friday

The weekly half-hour program over
station WBT, Charlotte, was broadeast
last Friday beginning at five o'clock. ‘The

Morning Fire Damages

‘CLUB’; Now Reoccupied

The Club, a special dormitory
housing the overflow of students
from the college dormitories, the
former home of Dr. Foreman, was
damaged by a fire caused by sparks
from the chimney falling on the
shingle roof, early Tuesday morning,
October 1.

All the property was
saved, and they have been living in
the vacant Fraternity
Court, in the old gymnasium, and in
homes out in town.

College authorities estimated the
damage at $750,‘and repairs were
begun at once. Most of the house has
been reoccupied, all but four of the
students returning last week-end.
