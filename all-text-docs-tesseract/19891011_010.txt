You usually don’t have to bother

tionwagon as | backed out of the
parking space.

Those were bad days.

My step-father hated me. He was
in the mafia. He held a gun to my
head and told me if | failed the test
again he'd kill me. | wondered why
he cared.

My step-father came home late at
night. He owned this nightclub
called “Socks.” People died there
all the time. My step-father had to
stay late and hide the bodies. He’d
come into my room after he got
home and jerk me out of bed. He’d
make me drive him around while he
tinkled the ice in he George Dickle
and smoked. He said the practice
would do me good. | wasn’t allowed
to listen to the radio.

One night when we were driving,
he made me stop at Maurice’s
house. Maurice was a little younger
than my father. He told me his wife
went crazy, and he had locked her
away in a mental institution. My
step-father snickered. Maurice
gave me a little pink capsule." |
thought | was supposed to eat it,
but my step-fater told me to snort it.
He broke the capsule in half and
dumped the white powder onto a
coffee table. Then he lined it with a
credit card. In the mean time, Mau-
rice rolled up a one-humdred dollar
bill until it was as thin as a straw.
He sniffed the first line but made me
snortthe rest. My step-father said it
would help me drive better. ;

Those were bad nights.

Maurice gave me driving lessons.
It was my step-father’s idea. Mau-

going to buy drugs. Drugs scared me.

The curtains were already closed
when we got to the room. They were
orange. | heard the Wonder Woman
music on the television. Maurice
didn’t knock. He opened the door and
pulled me inside. He’d been holding
me by the arm all the time--even in
the car.

Angie was watching Wonder
Woman.and drinking a beer. She
wasn’t as old a Maurice. She had
silver hair and blue eyes. She had on
eyeshadow in three colors. | stared at
her clothes for too long, and Maurice
pinched me hard. She wore a short
black skirt with fishnet hose and a half
t-shirt with a rose decal across the
boobs. She had on high-heels too.
Maurice said, “Angie, I’d like for you to
meet Melanie.”

| thought | was supposed to shake
her hand, but she touched my face
instead: She touched my face and
said, “Purdy.”

My mother thought it was stupid that
my step-father wouldn't let me take
the driver's test again. Her lover
thought it was stupid too. My step-
father hit my mother’s lover over the
head with the fireplace poker. We
thought he was dead, but he drove
home.

My mother cried because my step-
father had Maurice, but she had no
one. | listened to them argue and

and told me to driveto the green
motel. | thought he was going to give
me some drugs--even though we
didn’t buy drugs there the time before.
| told him I'd rather go home, but he
squeezed my arm. | knew he had a
gun because he was twirling it around
his finger.

Angie was watching a talk-show on
tv, but Wonder Woman came on after
we’d been there a while. Angie kissed
me on the mouth. Maurice made me
take my clothes off and lie down with
Angie. | wanted to keep my socks on,
but he said no. Angie stuck her
tongue in my belly-button, and | got
chills, maybe from the air conditioner.
She had long fingernails. But she
didn’t scratch me the way Maurice did.

Before we left, Angie let the baby

out.of the closet. The-baby wasn’t al- .

lowed to watch Wonder Woman. He
was five or six years old, but he still
crawled. Angie fixed the baby a
Dickle and asked me to change his
diaper. But | said no because Mau-
rice was twirling his gun again.
Angie said, “Tell Melanie goodbye,
baby.” But the baby got confused.
He crawled over to Maurice and
touched his cheek and gurgled,

poured the baby a Dickle, and spun

“Puddy.”

My stepfather bought Maurice a
ring. Maurice slipped the ring onto his
penis, and it got stuck there. Maurice
didn't go to the doctor for a couple of
days because he was embarrassed.
Finally, he got so sick | had to drive
him to the hospital. He had an opera-
tion, and they cut it off.

My step-father came home from
“Socks” late one night and made me
take him for a drive. We went to the
hospital to visit Maurice. My step-
father took back his ring. Maurice
wept and adjusted his hearing aid. My
step-father broke open three laxatives
and dumped the white powder into
Maurice’s IV bag.

On the way home, my step-father
told me to drive by “Socks.” We went
inside, and | saw a woman scrubbing
the pink off a wall. She was almost
finished. She asked my step-father
for a ride home. He said, “Certainly.”
She asked my step-father if she could
bottle up the red water in the bucket
and take it home to her baby. He
said, “of course.” | played the radio
really loudly. . 3

| got pulled over by the cops three
times that year. That first time;-a-
policeman saw me driving at night
without my headlights. That was the
night we carried the maid home from
“Socks.” My step-father made me
turn off the lights. He wanted to listen
to the maid cry.

The next time | was speeding. My
step-father was speeding too. When
the policeman poked his head inside
the window, my step-father shoved a
one-hundred- dollar bill up his nose.
When he jerked his head back, we
drove away. The last time, | got |

We were in a hurry. Someone had

father that Maurice was there. My
step-father carried the fire-poker. |

So | disregarded the two stop signs,
and a policeman pulled me over. He

looked annoyed. | told the policeman
that | had a three-month-old baby at

the baby waiting.” :

My step-father jabbed me in the

My step-father buried Maurice and
Angie. In the car onthe way home, -
