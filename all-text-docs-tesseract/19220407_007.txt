Catawba Game.

Double plays,

Thursday afternoon the Wildcats
snatched victory from seeming defeat
and by an-eighth inning rally which

netted six runs took the Catawba nine
into camp by a score of 6-4.

When Hunky McLeod, the premier
swatsmith of the Pee Dee league leaned
against the offering of Gibson, the piteh-
ing ace of Catawba, who cracked under
the strain in the eighth frame,” and
smashed a slashing single over the half-
Way station sending Crawford and Prit-
chett scampering across the platter with
the deciding counters of the contest, the
stands showed the same enthusiasm as in
the old days when John Schenck and
Spratt Moore used to waltz over the last
chalk line and the scorer chalked up an-
other seven points on the credit side of
the Wildcats’ ledger.

The Catawba lads scored a brace of
tallies in the fourth and in the cighth
pushed another the plate
Krown’s triple and Mooney’s single. With
the score 3-0 against them and Gibson
still going good it looked like the kalso-
brush would applied to the
Presbyterians.

hitting for Boushee, and Marrow  bat-

ticd the Pee Dee phenom lashed out a
hit for the third time during the matinee
and the winning tallies.
Brown greeted Gabriel who relieved Gib-
son with a single to right, driving Me-

Gibson started in great style whiffing

the fatal eighth. was in

itors to tally and Sorrells’ pitching the

jfelt the loss of Chambers building as
much as did the physics department. For

/Then, on that fatal day, November 28,
16021, the work of many years was swept
away with one mighty sweep.

However, it was not long e’re a new
jlaboratory for this branch of science
was begun to be erected. Work on this
[building was rushed, but due to a large
jamount of rain, it was only completed
jabout two weeks ago.

The completed wooden frame structure
jis located due east of the power house.
{It contains a basement, ground floor, and
second floor, On each floor every avail-
able inch of space is now being utilized.

In the basement may be found two
labs, one for applied mathematics, the

these two additions to the two respeec-
tive departments, work of Doctors Hood

The first floor divided into two
labs, a stock room, a room for lectures,
and an office for Dr. Douglas.

The labs, one for the Juniors, and one
for the Sophomores, are extremely well
equipped with new apparatus and con-

Besides the equipment previoisly men-

Junior lab is equipped with brick piers

ITS PLACE IN THE PLAN
OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

After each war in which we have been
engaged since 1776, there have been cer-
tain organizations which have perform-
ed valiant deeds, acts of heroism: But
today who remembers that organization
which, like its commander, stood like a
“stonewall” at Bull Run; or the one
which made the charge at Gettysburg;
or the other one which spent its force
against the Bloody Angle at Cold Har-
bor? These heroic organizations, as far
as general public knowledge is con-
cerned, have completely passed into ob-
livion. ;
Happily, our present National Defense
Act corrects this ‘unfortunate defect in

the country’s military policy. We have
row an army of the United States com-
posed of the Organized Reserve, Na-
tional Guard and the Regular Army.
Each of these components is distributed
throughout the United States according
to population. In order to perfect this
plan the country has been divided into
nine corps areas, each area having as-
signed to it certain units of the Organ-
ized Reserve, National Guard and Regu-
lar Army, all or nearly all of which saw
service overseas. To illustrate, take the
Fourth Corps Area, which is made up of
the States of North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee.
The units assigned to this area are:

Organized Reserve—8Ist or Wildcat
Division, 82nd or Dixie Division, 87th or
Akron Division.

National Guard—3oth or Old Hickory
Division and the 30th Division,

Regular Army—Not assigned yet.

Not only the names but, through the
present policy, the organizations them-
selves will live on and on through the
enlistment and re-enlistment of
triotic people.

In time of peace the Regular Army is,
naturally, on duty at all times; the Na-
tional Guard, in addition to its armory
Cvills is given certain field training each
year; the Organized Reservist receives
15 days of field training annually except
when it interferes with his
business or when the appropriation is
not sufficient. During the time of a na-
tional emergency, expressly declared by
an Act of Congress, the entire Army of
the United States is called into service.
When participating in field training in
time of peace or called into service in
time of a national emergency all the
personnel of the Army of the United
States receives pay and allowances au-

The Organized Reserve gets its man
power from the World War Veterans,
the Civilian Military Training Camps,
and the R. O. T. C. Upon graduation a
student of the R. O. T. C. may now go
into the organization in which his father,
brother or other relative served during

McAULEY, GARRISON &
HOPKINS CO. SECURE
PLUMBING CONTRACT

It has been of those in
charge of the building of our new build-
ings to seleet- the best contractors avail-
able. In carrying out this policy, Me-
Auley, Harrison and Hopkins Co. were
chosen to do the plumbing work in the
new dormitories. They are old friends
of the college, having furnished supplies
from time to time and last year they did
the plumbing work in the two temporary
dormitories.

the policy

They are not only doing most of the
plumbing here, but are one of the lead-
ing concerns in Charlotte. Their work
may be found in nearly all parts of the
city. The Brown Betty Tea Room and
the Mutual Building & Loan building are
both being fitted up by them.

The -plumbing in a large per cent of
the newer residences in. Myers Park was
done by them: They are, just now, com-
pleting the plumbing work in the new
Myers Park Apartment House. ‘

Davidson expects that good work, the
best of work, in fact, will be put into
these new buildings, and we are sure of
getting it from our plumbers as well as
others. (Ady.)
