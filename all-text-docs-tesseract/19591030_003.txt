SIDELINES
UN SPORTS

By B. MILLNER

WE’RE STUCK WITH Tee Redding—and we're glad
of it. Things could be much worse. The Asheboro. mar-
ried man passed passably. against the ball-hawking V.M.I.
secondary at Lexington last weekend and ran much bet-
ter than anyone thought he could.

Benson has been working out this week but his
chances of seeing action against Wofford tomorrow are
slim. Again the responsibility lies with Tee Redding and
we think he'll come through. To say the ’Cats could use
a win at this stage of the game would be the under-
statement of the year.

THE INFIRMARY LIST grows longer every day.
Added to Benson's knee and Warden's ankle are Booker
Clark’s neck and Jenning’s Snider’s shoulder. Warden
was hurt at almost the same moment as Benson—in the
third quarter of the P.C. game.

30th Clark, a sophomore who started the last two
games at end, and Snider, a defensive standout lately,
were injured in downfield tackling workouts early this|
week.

Coach Dole said that he was aware that he was tak-
ing a risky gamble in scheduling rough workouts, but
explained that downfield tackling was so shoddy against
V.M.I. that the practice was necessary.

THE WILDCATS traditionally have tough luck with
the Homecoming game. Out of 33 attempts, they have
been able to win only six. Three ties with VMI have
resulted, but the Keydets whopped us last year 42-7.

There's some consolation in the record book, how-
ever. Among the sparse wins are a 54-0 slaughter of
William and Mary and 51-6 win over Washington and
Lee. In the ’20’s, when several Davidson teams were the
scourge of the state, the ’Cats whipped North Carolina
10-0.

i

MENTAL ATTITUDE is an intangible thing that
sometimes wins ball games and, just as often, loses them.
Coach Dole says the Wildcats have a good mental at-
titude toward tomorrow's Homecoming game.

We hope they do, but if they’ve taken the press re-
leases to heart, they don’t. The DAVIDSONIAN plastered
the “We May Lose Eight” headline all over the top of
the sports page two weeks ago.

We question the psychology of the source, but it
was news and we print news. For all we know, we may
lose eight—but we’re confident that 33 football play-
ers tomorrow afternoon aren't counting on it. —

Keydet Passes Throw

Cats For 34-7 Loss

Poor pass defense proved a mighty stumbling block
for the Wildcats last Saturday in Lexington, Va.

V.M.L’s Howard. Dyer noted
the gaping weakness and tossed
his team to a 34-7 Southern
Conference win,

The second-string quarter-
back connected with end Dick
Evans for touchdown aerials of

pass set up a V.ML.I. score, and
Dyer plunged over from the

The Keydets come to David-
son Wednesday, proud holders
of a 26-29 victory over formid-
able West Virginia. Their hopes
for the championship will be
on the track and Davidson, hip
deep in proven strength, won’t
be caught flat-footed. The loss
of Wildcat co-captain Larry Mc-
Neill, however, may dampen
his team’s chances. McNeill was
forced out of action with shin-
