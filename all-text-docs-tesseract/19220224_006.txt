Nothing will put a man in tune
with the universe and keep him in
perfect harmony with his work
like getting on the job early in th
morning and taking advantage ig
the full day that nature provides
out of every twenty-four hours.

Work is a natural habit of man
—the best one he can have in bus-
iness—and when he acquires that
habit and makes it a part of him-
self everything else seems to work
out to his liking.

There may be variations in the
net results of the days, but, the
sum total of the months-and years
will work out right by any math-
ematical equation.—Selected.

it, imploring its aid. But alas, he had
busied himself too greatly with temporal
things. His thoughts of God came too
late.

Although this was a primeval man,
ever since then men have been lulled by
a false sense of security. There comes
a time in every life when.food, comfort
and wealth do not satisfy the desires
of the heart. When the inevitable comes
in old age the average person tries to
cultivate the spirit with the small residue
of life left, just as this hunter provided
for calamity only at the last moment.

The speaker then forcefully brought
home to each man present the lesson.
that each one has at least two-thirds-of
his life ahead of him, it behoeves us to
early center our attention on more im-
portant things than temporary happi-
ness, and thereby be prepared for the
impending calamity when it arrives.

His righteousness.” God’s most precious
gift to man is life itself. How will yours

ment over his father, still the conditions
were such that God permitted the king-}
dom of Israel to be harrassed by the
Syrian king. ;

1. The first use of the man of God
is to give cyes to our political life. But
for the keen vision of Elisha, Jehoram
would have fallen into the traps which
the Syrian king set for him, The true
man of God is useful as giving his soci-
ety wisdom, Sin blinds and corruption
gives a false sense of security. Society
had always needed clear. headed think-
ing, and the true man of God is equip-
ped, as no one else is, for this function.

2. The second use is to warn against
the danger his vision discloses. If the
first may be said to be the cognitive, this

Lord opened the eyes of the young
man; and, behold, the mountain was full
of horses and chariots of round
about Elisha.”

4. The second division of our lesson
has to do with the “sore trouble” of the
king of Syria. He could not understand
why his schemes had failed, and he did
not understand why. Does it not re-
mind one of the failure of Von Kluck to
enter Paris? Germany never knew,
Von Kluck could never explain why his
apparently irresistible army was halted
at the gates of the French capital. As
for the king of Syria, he became suspi-
cious that his camp harbored either a
spy or a traitor. But somebody in his
confidence seemed to have done a little
thinking. The explanation offered that
in Israel there was a man of God. You
remember Kitchener’s remark when told
that the English line had held against
the superior force of Germany: “Some-
body has keen praying. |

5. And the last section of our lesson
seems designed to call our attention to|
the folly of (attempting t6 compass the}
forces of righteousness by material)
force. The king of Syria had stupidly |
concluded that his schemes had been |
thwarted by some spy; and having his |
mind set right here, he goes on to make |
ahother blunder.

his “sore trouble” made known to him}
he sets out to remove it. The folly to!

It is one of the}
hardest lessons men ever have to learn |
that they can legislate morals into a!
people. |

chariots, and a great host; and they
