Arnold, Kane
victorious in
SGA elections

By BLEVIN SHELNUTT
Senior Staff Writer

Nearly 1,100 students voted in
Davidson’s 2005 student govern-
ment elections and, despite contro-
versy, SGA novice Ryan Arnold
*°06 overcame three veterans and
was elected as the new SGA presi-
dent.

“I had been thinking about run-
ning for awhile in order to bring
new ideas and a fresh attitude to
SGA,” Arnold said. “I decided it
was time to take a chance and put
my money where my mouth was.”

Arnold does not take full credit
for his victory, however. “I proba-
bly couldn’t have done it without
the support and encouragement of
my roommate Justin, the football
team, my fraternity, and all of my
other friends.”

According to Arnold, the biggest
issue SGA currently faces is its
lack of communication with the
general student body.

“Students are unaware of what’s
going on as well as the opportuni-
ty to become involved,” Arnold
said.

Several students agreed.

‘el don’t usually know what the
SGA is working for until it actual-
ly happens,” said Dana Clifford
07.

Chuck Ostendorff ’06 said,
“Davidson’s SGA is a strong pro-
gram. I’m thankful for the pass/fail
deadline extension and cable, but
we usually don’t hear about what’s
going on and what’s been accom-
plished until election time.”

Arnold’s additional objectives
include expanding Cat Card access
to various restaurants and stores,
moving spring break until later in
the semester, and pushing for the

renovation of the sophomore
apartments.
“I’m interested in people,”

Arnold said. “I want to affect the
students and shape the college.”

Other student leaders expressed
excitement about working with
Amold and possibilities for the
upcoming year.

“This semester will be dedicat-
ed to building our Union Board

Class of 2009 off to a good start

ED apps slightly
up from last year

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson’s admissions office
recently finished with early appli-
cations for the class of 2009. 184
applicants were admitted, which
nearly matched last year’s total of
186 accepted applicants.

Davidson received 440 early
decision applications. This num-
ber slightly exceeded last year’s
total of 418 early decision applica-
tions and correlates with a slight
jump in overall applications.

“We are excited about this fine
group of students who love
Davidson and made us their clear

first choice,” said Senior Associate
Dean Wookie Payne.

Payne spoke highly of the
incoming wave of early decision
applicants that were accepted. She

specifically praised their diversity.

“This group represents a good
base for building the class of
2009,” she said. “In this group are
musicians, poets, athletes, dancers,
artists, scientists, and all kinds of
leaders.”

Payne anticipates the class of
2009 to have around 460 students.
The early decision students will
comprise 40 percent of that group,
which is a slight increase over last
year.

Payne’s enthusiasm extends to
the rest of the applicant pool that

Skewed survey results
hamper sub-free debate

By KATE GILLESPIE
Senior Staff Writer

The results of the Feb. 1 sub-
free housing survey reveal that stu-
dents who have lived in substance
free housing are more inclined to
support sub-free housing options
than students who have only lived
in “regular” housing.

The results of the survey are
skewed in that 21 percent of the
respondents to the survey for stu-
dents who had lived in sub-free
housing have actually never been
sub-free.

“There was a small problem
with people not reading directions
carefully enough before taking the
survey,” said Associate Dean of
Residence Life Leslie Marsicano.
“Eight sub-free residents took the
regular housing survey and 75
people who have never lived in
sub-free housing took the sub-free
survey. Still,
large enough that the task force
found it helpful.”

The committee on sub-free
housing will make a recommenda-
tion about the future of sub-free
housing at Thursday’s SGA meet-
ing. With the input of the SGA,
the Counsel on Campus and
Religious Life will present a final
recommendation to _ President
Bobby Vagt.

Overall, 683 students responded
to the survey for students who

the response was —

have never lived in sub-free, and
353 people responded to the sub-
free survey.

Respondents who were not sub-
free favored allowing sub-free stu-
dents to be paired as roommates
and dispersed among regular halls
over all other options. Thirty-eight
percent chose this option, while 22
percent favored keeping the sub-

free coed buildings currently

offered at Davidson.

Other options included having
sub-free halls in regular buildings,
having sub-free buildings for first-
year students and for upperclass-
men as demand requires, and plac-
ing clusters of sub-free of rooms
on regular halls.

In the non-sub-free survey, 492
respondents indicated that they
chose to live in regular housing
because they thought these halls
would be more diverse; 485 stu-
dents also cited their fear that sub-
free halls would create an isolated

Laundry service dispels rumors of washing process

institutions in the nation that continues to pro-
vide laundry service for its students.

Although it might be a stretch to say that some
come to Davidson only to avoid buying deter-
gent, separating colors, and fighting for avail-
able machines, many students find the laundry
service an indispensable and integral part of life
in the “Davidson Bubble.”

Others, however, are hesitant to trust the laun-
dry service with their clothing and are skeptical
about its washing methods.

For years, rumors have persisted that students’
dirty laundry is boiled in a sweltering pot of
water sans detergent, causing that favorite T-
shirt or pair of high school jeans to shrink and

An interview with laundry manager Aaron
Jackson sheds some light on the subject. Jackson
has been at Davidson for eight years and has
managed the laundry service for the past four.

“Ever since I have been manager,” Jackson
said, “upperclassmen have been telling the
underclassmen that we don’t use detergent and
boil the clothes. That’s just not the case.”

Jackson said that clothes are washed with jes
environrfatally-friendly detergents, but fabric }
softeners and supplementary chemicals are not
used as many students are allergic to them.

He warns students against including their own
