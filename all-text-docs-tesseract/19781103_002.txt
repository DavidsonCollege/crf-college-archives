At an open meeting of the
Advisory Council for Finance,
Personel and Development last
Tuesday, Religion Professor
Max Polley expressed his ‘‘con-
cern about the difficulty of
younger faculty members to
acquire permanent housing and
to pay for it.”

He said his concern stems
from “a sense of tension be-
tween the haves and the have
nots among the faculty and
staff members in the face of
increasing interest rates and
construction costs.

Polley said he recognized the
problem is essentially ‘‘the fault
of the economy,” yet he ques-

‘ tioned whether the present sub-
‘sidy provided by the College ‘‘is
enought and is it helping?” -

Presently Davidson College
sponsors a Housing Subsidy
Program which helps to defray
the interest payments on loans
used to purchase or to build
housing.

College Business Manager
Robert Currie describes the
program as “incentive to con-
struct or buy houses for those
faculty and staff persons, who
after two years, are expected to

be permanent members of the.

College community.”

Under the program, the fa-
culty or staff member obtains a
loan from a lending institution.

between a 6 percent and 8%

may extend for a twenty-year

“But the key feature of this
program is that younger profes-
sors received a greater amount
of this subsidy in their lower
income years,”’ explained Cur-
rie. “Therefore he has greater
incentive to build and the
College has less pressure to
increase rental units.”

The College commits itself to
providing rental housing or to
help find other housing for all
those faculty and staff persons
who are recruited by the Col-

lege. ‘‘At Davidson, the College
tries! to maintain a sense of
community,” added Currie.

“¥ don’t personally feel the
tension, but there is certainly
talk among the younger faculty
members who wonder if they
can ever have housing. Whene-
ver you have such a large gap,
I'd be surprised if you didn’t
have some tension.”

Currie acknowledged the pos-
sibility of tension: ‘Naturally
there was a rift when the old
program was stopped. But I feel

that any rift was corrected when

we liberalized the subsidy pro-
gram in 1977.” .

Presently, thirty faculty
members are taking advantage
of the new subsidy program and
Currie anticipates five homes
per year will be purchased under
the program.

‘‘At Davidson, the College
tries to maintain a sense of
community,’’ added Currie. “In

_ The Davidsonian

‘The haves and the have nots’—
a rift develops in Davidson’s faculty

fostering this spirit, the College
expects the faculty and staff to
live in Davidson. This program,
therefore, is unique in that not
many institutions need a pro-
gram of this sort,”’ he conti-
nued.

: Vice President for Academic
Affairs, Price Zimmermann e-
choed Polley’s concern. ‘‘The™
hideous increase in the cost of
new housing is putting home- -
ownership out of the reach of
moderate income families all
over the country.”

" He added that with ‘‘the
increasing dispersion of faculty

,members towards the periphe-
Ty, McConell Farm will be the
next series of lots available to
faculty members.”

Zimmermann explained in
view of this that “the drop-in,
informal relationship (between
students and faculty) works
best when there is geographic
centrality.

RELIGION PROFESSOR Max Polley says'he is concerned about
the way high interest rates have created a rift in the faculty. The
junior faculty is not able to buy big homes in Davidson.

College-based groups join leftist coalition

DETROIT, MI. (CPS)—Repre-
sentatives of over 100 labor,
community and political organi-
zations have agreed to establish’
a “coalition of coalitions” by
mid-November to counter orga-
nized right-wing activity, and
to pressure the Democratic
Party to its stated platform.

Some 200 respresentatives of
groups ranging irom the inter-
national Ladies Garmet Wor-
kers Union to the Sierra Club
have authorized United Auto
Workers Union president Doug-
las Fraser to set up two
commissions to work out details
of the new coalition. The com-
missions are expected to meet in
mid-November and the official
announcement of the group’s
formation and name will be
made then.

The coalition was agreed
on last month (October) at a
Detroit meeting called by Fra-
ser who said in his invitation,
“The time has come. . . for a
vigorous counterattack against
the right-wing corporate forces
and the political system they
dominate.’”’

one-day conference included 31

is an attempt to pressure the
Democratic Party: ‘‘The strate-
gy we propose,” said Fraser,
“aims to make the Democratic
Party in fact what in principle it
has proclaimed itself to be since
the New Deal—a progressive
party struggling against the
reactionary capitalist money’

transform Amefica into a fair
and decent sociéty.

Although there is a strong
Democratic Congress, and a
Democrat in the White House,
many conference speakers ob-
served that much of the pro-

labor unions, and over 70

social action, consumer rights,
health care, housing, tax re-

Business Manager Bob Cur-
rie said, ‘‘No decisions can be
made without a thorough exa-
mination of the situation, espe-
cially in regard to what WDAV
equipment was bought with
student money.”

College President Samuel
Spencer was reluctant to com-
ment on the matter, awaiting
further input from other mem-
bers of the administration.

Communications ‘Director
Martha Roberts also, had no-
thing to say about the funds.

Roberts is presently working
on the fine points of her
proposal for the future pro-
gramming and operation of
WDAV, which she had hoped to
submit to Spencer during the
first part of this week.

The proposal is expected to
contain comprehensive guide-
lines for WDAV’s staffing,
funding, program format, orga-
nization, and general operation.

She said that it will not be
released to the public until
Spencer has made any adjust-
ments as he desires and gives it
his final approval.
