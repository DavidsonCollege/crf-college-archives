Davidson hosts fall regatta

By JOHN WILLINGHAM

Saturday, the Davidson
College Sailing Team hosts the
‘Daryl Douglas Fall Invita-
tional Regatta. Schools expec-
ted to be participating are NC
State, UVA, Duke, Old Dom-
inion, Christopher Newport,
UNC, and Davidson.

This will be one of three fall
races held by the Northern
Division of SAISA (South
Atlantic Intercollegiate Sail-
ing Association), to which DC
belongs.

Faculty advisor, Dr. Hal-
lam Walker, feels that this
year’s team will do well. “We
have some depth and exper-

ience,’’ he stated, and ‘‘a
number of good returning
skippers.”

He concluded that he could
not actually determine how
good the team would be,
because he had not. seen
enough of the freshmen in
competition.

Dr.:Walker also pointed out
that a major difference be-
tween college regattas and
those on a larger scale, such as
tthe recently completed Ame-
rica’s Cup, is the distance of
the races.

With the shorter courses for
these SAISA races, he re-
magked that, ‘‘So much de-
pends on the start. If you
make a bad start, you don't

have as much time to make it
up.”

This meet is a points reg-
atta, which means that it will
count in the totals towards the
Fall Championships.

From these championships,
which pit Northern Division
squads against Southern Divi-
sion ones, teams are design-
ated to go to nationwide
inter-sectional regattas.

In the past, DC has gone to

Notre Dame and Ohio State.
This year, the team has hopes
of racing in the Navy Co-Ed
Regatta in Annapolis.

Sophomore Jeff Harris sta-
ted that in the races on
Saturday, that ‘‘our main
division competition can be
expected from ODU and
UA

The event begins at 10 am
and will continue throughout
the day at the Lake Campus.

After a late pre-season prac-
tice start, Coach Carl Kremser
is optimistic about the David-
son soccer team.

Kremser views opening los-
ses to Madison and Guilford
as a lack of pre-season condi-
tioning.

In both matches, Davidson
held their own against tough
opponents in the first half,
only to wear down late in the
contest. But he sees a change
coming.

‘‘T think these kids are
going to surprise some people,
because they're really working
hard. It just: takes time,’’ says
Kremser.

Kremser comes to Davidson
from Killian High School in
Florida where he coached his
soccer team to a 15-5-2 record
last year.

The Wildcats play a very
difficult schedule this fall,
including UNC-Chapel Hill,
N.C. State, Appalachian
State, Duke, and South Caro-
lina. But Kremser is pleased
with the schedule feeling his
team will be playing on the

a

level of these big colleges
before long.

‘‘We are very young, but
the team shows great promise
for the future, particularly
our sophomore group.”’

The Wildcats are led this
year by co-captain Kevin Rob-
bins, a sophomore.

Kremser pointed out,
though, that this team is not
loaded with outstanding indi-
vidual power. However, more
important to him is their
ability to play as a team.

“Sooner or later we'll have
eleven outstanding players
playing together as an out-
standing team.”

That depends on the devel-
opment of young players such
as Robbins and freshman Jay
Cox.
