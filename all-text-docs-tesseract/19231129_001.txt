manship and dogged determination to win.

While there have been more successful
seasons in Davidson history, the Wildcat
team of 1923 has lived up to the traditions
of former years in every way.

Under a new coaching regime, the Wild-

cats have won three games and lost 6 against |

representative teams of the Carolinas and
Virginia. In only one game -has the Red-
jerseyed eleven been snowed under. Furman
romped home with a 30-0 victory.

Lack of weight, as has been always the
case, is the chief difficulty which Coach
has faced at Davidson.

shape. Injuries during the season have

brought the average below this mark in sev- |

eral_ games.
Against Carolina, the Wildcats presented

a line which averaged slightly over 155)
pounds from end to end, yet the Wildcat |

spirit asserted itself and the Tar Heels had
to fight for their 14-3 victory.

In spite of this handicap Coach Monk has
done wonders with his material. The center
who played the whole game against Carolina

tipped the beam at 145 pounds, but he has |

been developed into a good linesman.

In early season, Wildcat supporters were
disappointed in the showing of Jim Hendrix
but against the Tar Heels Jim played a won-

derful game and looks good for next year’s |

eleven.
During the season Wells has developed into
‘a spectacular back. He has only played in|
two college games but in both he has starred. |

j two teams.

He was born in’ Lynchburg,  Vir-
ginia, where he received his — earliest
training. He then went to Fishburne
Military Academy. He came to Dav)

fidson in 1915, and here his college athletic
career began in a blaze of glory. In his
Freshman year Monk was All-State end,
;guard on Red and Black basketball quint,
second baseman on the baseball team, and
| high jumper on the track team. He holds
| the honor of being the only athlete who ever
;succeeded in winning a letter in four
branches of sports at Davidson. |

Monk, went back to V. P. I. in 1916 and
there made a record that: was very note-
| worthy. When the call to colors summoned
| Monk, he joined the University of Virginia
' Ambulance Unit and saw 17 months of serv-

| The next year Monk was called to V. P. I.
| where Tech made wonderful records, as a
result of his efforts.

| Coming to Davidson with such a record,
| Coach Monk started things going and the
| Wildcat varsity has scrapped like true Wild-
|cats.. Among the many things which go to
| make his work here at Davidson such a suc-
| cess, is the fact that he has won the support
| of the student body.

Coach Monk is counted as one of the most |

|
| popular men in the entire college.

Coach S. D. Tilson, Younger’s right hand
|man, began his football career at V. P. I.
| He came to V. P. I. from Texas, and al-
|though football was an entirely new thing
|to him, it fascinated him from the start, so
he reported for practice. His size and
strength and fighting spirit lead him to suc-
cess. He was All-Southern tackle for three
years, and last year his name won a promi-
nent place on the All-Southern and All-
South-Atlantic honor rolls.

Coach Tilson has without doubt proved
himself to be one of the best line coaches to
be found in the South.

Five Carolina, Two Wake Forest,
Two State Men and One Each
From Davidson and Trinity Make
Up Selection

Kight years ago, away back in 1915, Monk
Younger, then a Freshman at Davidson, play-
ing his first year of college football, was a
unanimous choice for an end position on the
mythical All-State eleven. The next year he
left the state and went to V. P. 1, but he will
always be remembered as one of the most
aggressive ends ever seen in North Carolina,

After a lapse of cight years, Monk has re-
turned to North Carolina football circles as
Head Coach of the Davidson Wileats and has
injected into the Wildeats that same aggres-
sive spirit which made him such a power on

the gridiron, Coach Monk has seen every

‘football team in the state in action on more

than one oceasion this fall, and in’ selecting
his All-State eleven for the Davidsonian he
has chosen a well balanced organization of
brilliant stars; one capable of every form of
attack, and combining with its attack a strong
defense.

On the left) wing Coach
selected Captain Casey Morris of Carolina
on account of his all round ability, both on
offense and defense. Morris is a brilliant
receiver of forward passes, a man who is

Younger has

Hhard to get around, and one who is capable ot
jhandling any man placed against him,

On the other flank is Captain "Lias Faison
of Davidson whose defensive play has stood

out in every game of the season. "Lias is

lespecially good at boxing in the opposing
tackle and many a play has gained around his

end on account of his ability to take his man
out of the play. With this pair of ends the
flanks are well guarded and a good passing
attack is assured. Captain Pagano of the
Wake PForest cleven is another end whose
work has shown up well this year.
Melver.of Carolina is the best het for left
tackle. He has weight, is hard to unbalance,
and is an adept at breaking through the line
and smearing plays. In the Davidson game
