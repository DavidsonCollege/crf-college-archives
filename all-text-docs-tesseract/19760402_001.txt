Davidson College recently named
“eam Dartmouth basketball coach Gary
Walters head basketball coach, with a
hree to four year contract.

Walters coached Dartmouth’s
basketball team to its best season
since 1958 this year with a 16-10
finish and a third place in the Ivy
League. The NCAA selected him New
England and District I Coach of the
Year.

Walters has an overall record of 75

year of coaching at Middlebury
College, where he was 7-17.

Since then he was coach at Union
College, where he was 53-13 in
1971-73 and was an assistant coach at
Princeton from 1973-75, during which
time Princeton went 38-18 overall and
won a National Invitational Tourna-
ment (NIT) championship.

“We feel fortunate to have Gary,”
said Athletic Director Thomas A.
Cartmill. ‘“He’s one of the finest
young coaches in America today. He
has proven himself both as a player
and a coach.”

Walters was All-Ivy in his Junior

team that was third in the NCAA
tournament in 1965.

Walters left Dartmouth for David-
son because, ‘‘first, it is a school with
an excellent academic reputation.

‘It is a school which I respect a
great deal, and which I can work in
the confines of,”’ he said. ‘‘Second, it
has a great basketball tradition.”

Walters had few goals to offer. He
said Tuesday that, not having met
with ther team, he could posit no
goals other than to turn the basket-
ball program around and to develop a
winning season and to have every
player work up to his potential.

Faculty daolinas SIR forms,
plans voluntary evaluations

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

The faculty recently voted
to discontinue the use of the
Student Instructional Report
(SIR) form used in connection
with student evaluation of
faculty members in favor of a
form designed with Davidson
specifically in mind.

The faculty, in taking this
action, adopted a report from
its Professional Affairs
Committee (PAC) concerning
use of the SIR forms.

Chairman of the Profes-
sional Affairs Committee R.
B. Jackson explained why the
PAC recommended to the
faculty that use of the SIR be
discontinued as unsuited to
Davidson’s needs.

“It is important to know
what use is to be made of the
evaluations..Then you can
decide what sort of form suits
your purposes best.

“The expense of the form is
also a factor. There were
complaints that the SIR was
not productive in terms of the
information gained relative to
the cost of the forms,” he said.

Jackson explained that the
original purpose of the SIR,
the use of which was initiated
by former Vice President for
Academic Affairs John Bevan,
was to aid the academic vice
president in evaluation of
faculty members for tenure,
promotion, or salary increase.

The PAC report to the
faculty recommended that
another form be designed for
use by Davidson students.
The committee report recom-
mended that when the new
form was put into operation,
students be informed that no
unsigned forms would be
accepted.

“The Professional Affairs
Committee feels that the
requirements that the forms

be signed may make some
students more responsible in
their responses and might
inhibit others. We do not feel
that Davidson students will be
so inhibited as to make signed
forms useless.

“But also, if the information
is ever to be used when there
might be serious consequences
for the professor involved,
then that professor should
have the right to face his
accusers,” said Jackson.

The PAC report to the
faculty also recommended that
when the new form is used the
dean of the faculty not place
undue emphasis upon the
results of the questionnaires.
Jackson explained why this
was included in the report.

“Basically it’s a reminder.
The temptation to over-
emphasize the results of any
quantitative study is great.
We just wanted to remind the
dean of this fact.

‘‘We did not make any
attempt to define what ‘undue
emphasis’ is,’’ he said.

A further recommendation
of the PAC to the faculty was
that no pressure be placed on
students to complete the
forms. ‘‘The Professional
Affairs Committee felt that
some students feel that they
have to turn in the form in
order to be able to take the
examination in the course.
That’s pressure.

‘‘In those cases, when a
student fills out the form when
he doesn’t want to it’s unlikely
that this forcing of responses
will improve the quality of
information in the sample,’’
said Jackson.

Jackson indicated that the
PAC report recommended that
all information gained from
the evaluation be kept con-
fidential. This would prohibit

_the use of the information for a

course evaluation handbook.

“The Professional Affairs
Committee has recommended
that information gathered
from forms of this kind be
revealed only to the faculty
member, his department
chairman, the dean of the
faculty, and the president.

“The right of the faculty
member to privacy is very
important here,” he said. :

Jackson also indicated that
such use of the information
would beinconsistant with the
purpose of the form, i.e., to be
used for evaluation of faculty
members for tenure,
promotion, or salary increase.

LUNCH AT BAILEY HOUSE: eco-
nomic problems face the College
food service

Scott considering cafeteria,
900 Room remains problem

By JAMIE KOLODITCH
Staff Writer

The Davidson College food
service may be forced to revert
to tradition cafeteria service.
Director of the ARA Slater
Food Service Ron Scott may
make such a proposal to
College Business Manager
Robert A. Currie within the
next month.

Economics represent the
most important problem of the
food service.

The parent company
expects profit of five percent,
while actual profits amount to
only two percent. Rising
prices for labor and supplies
are not the sole reason.

“Bailey has got problems,”
said Scott. ‘‘The people that
make use of the variety of
foods there enjoy it; but not as
many use it as we had

“Most of the students prefer
the Snack Bar, which is doing
very well,’ he said.

Scott also pointed out that

“the present system is. highly

inefficient. He feels that the
students would benefit from a
more balanced regimen, and
that such a change could lower
the price of board.

“The meal ticket system is
expensive to both students
and parents. We are going to

have to cut down on frills and
variety, and make sure that
the foods served are more
nutritious.

“What we have in mind is a
basic 14-20 meal per week
plan, in which a missed meal
could not be reclaimed and

which would allow unlimited
seconds. ’’

The decisionwill be made in
conjunction with Currie and
the students of Davidson
College, who will be consulted
before any changes take place.

The 900 Room, which is not
doing as well as expected,
remains a sore spot for Scott.

“The 900 Room is holding
its own, not as much as we’d

‘like it to, but holding its

own,” said Scott. ‘‘We could
be doing much better. Right
now it is a strictly marginal
operation.

“I think the major problem
is that there are too many
restraints and not enough
activities to bring the pedple
to the 900 Room,’’ he
continued. ‘‘There should be
more discos, open mikes, sing-
a-longs, and student bands.
There are any number of

‘things that could be done to

increase student participation.

“If things don’t happen up
there more often, it’ll turn into
a white elephant,’’ said Scott.
