Retires From Office

Hon. James Boyd, After 19 Years
Continuous Service as U. S.
District Judge, Retires
to Private Life

Davidson College has not a_ large
number of alumni who have attained to
prominence in the neld of law, and so
it is with great pleasure that we read of
the work and characier of Hog, James
E. Boyd, '66, whe, on October 29, prac-
tically resigned his pcsition as United
States district judge of the Western dis-
trict of North Carolina.

James Edmund Boyd was born in
Alamance county, and received his first
schocling at Graham Academy, follow-
ing this by a course at Davidson College.
He served as a private in the Thirteenth
N.C. Infantry and in the First N. C.
Cavalry under the Confederacy. He
was admitted to the North Carolina bar
in 1868, and during a part of the period
from 1870 to 1880 he was a member of
the § ate Legislature and a delegate ta
the State Constituional Convention. Ini
1880 he was made U. S. District At-
tcrney in the Western Nortn Carolina
district, holding this pesition until 1885.
From 1897 unal 1900 he was Assis:ant
At.orney General of the United States.
He received his appointment as U. S.
District Judge on July 11, 1900, which
position ne has held continuousty, with
henor to numself, since that date.

Judge Boyd passed his seveniy-fourth
birthday last February, and. altho he is
beginning to show his age slightly from

Freshman Lewis Deserts College to

+ C.-W. Lewis, of the Freshman class.
recently gave his friends on the campus
a very severe jolt. On ‘Thursday a week
ago he went to his home in Greensbvuro,
ostensibly on a very innocent little week-
end trip. The rest of the college went
calmly on ‘about its work, in sublime ig-
norance that anything unusual was going
en. But on Thursday last pandemon-
ium broke loose. “he Greensboro News
had come, and it had printed an article
in which it had announced, in plain
black and white, that C. W. Lewis. our
Lewis, mind you, was—was married!
People went about with consternation on
their faces. Where. would the next case
break out?) Who would the next victim
be? Speculaticn was rife. When had
it happened?) Why had he thus deseried
us?

It seems that Lewis and Miss Ida
Hodgkin had been engaged ever since he
went te France with the famous ‘Thir-
tiech division. He had taken a course
at A. & E.. but he wanted a little aca-
demic work before settling down, How-
ever, when Lewis went home, he and
his girl talked it over, and they de-
cided, as young people will, that separa-
tion is the worst of all evils, and thar
the only sensible thing to do was to get
married at once. So that is exactly what
they did, last Wednesday evening.
| Lewis came back to college Friday and

the physical viewpoint, yet mentally he took his things home. The young couple
is stronger than many men of fewer |are living at gor Walker avenue, in
years. “Pne resignation was something Greensbore, where Lewis has secured an

LOWSHIPS IN FRENCH UNI-

VERSITIES.

Fellowships paying a thousand dollars
a year each have been provided for 25
American college graduates who may
wish to study in France. These fellow-
ships will. be distributed among the
various universitics of that country.
They: will be able to pursue graduate
studies in any department desired, just
as in American universities, or they may
take :medicine, law, engineering or any
ef the professional branches.

The candidates for appointment must
be able to read French books with facil-
ity, must submit application in duc form,
prior to January 1, and, if appointed, be
ready to go to France in June and work
on oral French until the universities
open in September. A letter just ree
ceived from the advisory board which
selects the fellows. gives assurance that
graduates of colleges such as Davidsin,
if well qualified. have just as good a
chance of appointment as graduates .of
larger institutions,

Any alumni of Davidson who are in-
terested in this matter should communi-
cate promptly with Prof. Thos. W. Lin-
ele. who represents at Davidson the in-
teres:s of the “Society for American Fel-
lewships in’ French Universities.”

ing will be called for in the near future,
plans for this meeting including a ban-
quet. The constitution and by-laws of
the organization will also be presented

quested to notify the secretary, giving his
name and address, in order that he may
be enrolled in the Davidson Alumni As-
seciation of Charlotte.
