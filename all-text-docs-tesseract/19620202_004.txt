Blind Man: Zany Game

out for various civic services in the neighboring area.

Participating in annual pro-

twelve social fraternities lent
Manpower to five hospitals, a
church, museum, fresh air camp,

In addition to special projects
during this week of pre-initia-

groups, ATO, Bete, and Sig Ep,

heave conducted semester-long :

projects. The pledges of ATO
have been making weekly trips
to the Charlotte Rehabilitation
Hospital and plan to continue
doing so as brothers. Besides
clean-up here, during the week
they have wielded the mop and
paint brush at Mt. Mourne’s old
Center Church and the Holy
Angel’s nursery at Belmont.
The Betas have been visiting
the North Carolina Orthopedic

would require fees for heat,
light, etc., which would be about
$300-$400 a year. The college
would probably provide certain
basic equipment for the house,
but would have no control of
the organization except to see
that no restrictions were placed
on membership.

Band Tours Florida
For Five Concerts

The Davidson College Concert
Band under the direction of
Grier M. Williams will begin its
annual tour Feb. 5 which, this
year, will take the collegians to
several Florida communities.

The first concert is scheduled
in Jacksonville, and subsequent
programs will be given at Cape
Canaveral, Florida Presbyterian
College at St. Petersburg, Lake-
land, and Winter Park.

Present plans do not call for
any eating facilities for regular
board. The center would be able
to serve light snacks at dance
weekends.

If a group within the organ-
ization should eer want to
form a fraternity It would have
to withdraw completely from
the organization. Maloney was
asked what would happen if so
large a group withdrew from
the organization that the re-
maining members could not

of the church. “Jack could not
tell whether or not he was on
brick because the whole thing
was iced over,” Fitts said. “But
he had a feeling he was there;
and after he found how the
walk broadened out, he knew he
was at the right place.”

Hollenbeck feels tnat the
game of bilindman is definitely
more challenging than trying to
jam 20 people into a telephone
booth or wear out the line by
keeping it busy for a hundred
hours. “In this, you’re on your
own," he said. “And you don’t
realize how much you don’t ob-
serve until you get that blind-
fold on. That's when the fun
begins.

Duke Offers Unique

Hail! O Davidson!”

Dr. Williams announced that
tour soloists are Joe Robinson,
oboe, and James Weber, flute.
Robinson will solo in Handel's
“Concerto for Oboe in B-flat”
while Weber will perform
Chaminade's “Concertino for
Flute.”

Both soloists are active in
campus and area music activi-
ties. Both perform in the col-
lege Woodwind Quintet, Wood-
wind Trio and Chamber Orches-
tra. Both are members of the
Charlotte Symphony and have
performed in the Transylvania
Music Camp and Brevard Music
Festival orchestras.

Robinson soloed this week
with the Charlotte Symphonette
in Mozart’s “Quartet in F for
Oboe and Strings.”

Several students raised ques-
tions about the amount of for-
mal organization that the group
; would require. Martin, Goody-
: koontz, and Maloney all express-
-ed opinions that a certain a-
mount of formal organization
' would be necessary’ for efficient
functioning.

The house and facilities would
be made available by next fall.
Until then the subcommittee
and the steering committee will
supervise the formation of the
organization.

Maloney, speaking personally
in response to a question about
the role of the group in Rush
Week, stated that he felt Its
presence should certainly be
made known to freshmen and
invitations extended to them as
they now receive invitations
from other groups.

Faculty Committee would not
award the fellowship to a stud-
ent unless they believed him
qualified for it.

Duke University will decide
later if the student's work is
deserving of a renewal of the
fellowship. Davidson seniors re-
ceiving honorable mention in
competition for this fellowship
will be able to apoly for other
Duke University fellowship a-
wards.

A great many graduate fields
of study are applicable to the
James B. Duke Fellowship.

Shannon Presents
Organ Selections

John Shannon, assistant pro-
fessor of music at Sweet Briar
College, will present the third

lege Organ Recital Series at

Camp For
Freshmen

The YMCA announced yester-
day that it. would hold a 1962
Freshman Camp and named jun-
ior Danny Carrell as director.
The pre-orientation camp will
be held Sept. +6 at Camp Stew-
art in Mecklenburg County.

The idea of a Freshman Camp |

was initiated by the Y two years
ago and the 1960 event was
termed a “success” by the spon-
sors and the college administra-
tion. The scheduling of opening
of school so close to Labor Day
last fall made a 1961 camp an
impossibility.

Working with Carrell on next
fall’s program will be a steer-
ing committee composed of Jim
Glenn, Frank Mansell, Fred Me-
Guirt, John Kuykendall and Dr.
George Staples. They will make
final recommendations for the
camp staff, which will include a
business manager, program
chairman, and 14 discussion
group leaders.

An invitation will be extended
to all incoming freshmen with
registration on a limited “first-
come” basis. The camp combines
an opportunity for freshmen to
meet each other and upperclass-
men through an informal pro-
gram which combines recreation.
and discussion, ranging on all
topies of campus life.

Pi Kap Celebrates
50th Anniversary

Epsilon chapter of Pi Kappa
Phi will hold a Golden Anniver-
sary Celebration on Sat., Feb. 3
at 2 p.m. at its chapter house.
This school year marks the 50th
year of the Epsilon chapter's
existence at Davidson.

Alumni, national fraternity
officers, and members of the
college family will be present.

The program planned includes
speeches by a national officer,
and an undergraduate brother.
Archon Peter Jorgensen wil!
speak, for the undergraduates,
on “Pi Kappa Phi—Past, Pres-
ent, and Future.”

There will be a coffee hour
from 2-4:15 followed by the pro-
gram after which a buffet sup-
per will be served. The official
program is scheduled to end at
6:30 p.m.

Traffic Court's Nil Effects

Prompt Revision Of Rules

The Office of the Dean of Students announced revis-

ions to the Automobile Regulations this week in an effort
to render the traffic court more effective. The new regu-
lations have been in effect since the beginning of this

semester.

The amended regulations pro-
vide, among other things, for
stiff penalties to be imposed on
habitual violators. The penalties
include restriction of automobile
use by multiple offenders.

‘HABITUAL VIOLATOR’

Any student whose violations
exceed six for the academic
year or four for any one semes-
ter will be regarded as an
“habitual violator,” Dean Rich-
ard C. Burts explained. A stud-
ent who fails to meet the Traffic
Committee could also be re-
stricted in car privileges.

An exception will be made
for students who have already
accrued more than six violations
this year. Penalties will not be
imposed upon them unless they
violate a rule one more time. In
other words, students with six
or more violations at this time
have no more margin in which
to work.

In the past, in theory. the
committee could restrict the car
of a multiple offender: The new
additions to the rules only make

specific the number of offenses
that can be accumulated before
a student is penalized.

BURTS SURPRISED

The new amendments were
Proposed by members of the
Traffic Committe from their ex-
perience with offenders. They
feel that stricter regulations are
needed to cut down on traffic
offenses. Dean Burts; his assist-
ant, John Kuykendall; and Mrs.
Joyce Fleagle of the bursar’s
office formulated the new regu-
lations. Ken Kelley, student
Liaison Officer to the Court, al-
so had a major role in formulat-
ing the amendments to the regu-
lations.

Dean Burts admitted surprise
at the fact the Traffic Court
idea had not decreased offenses.
He had felt at its instigation
that bringing students face-to-
face with the traffic problem
would make them realize its im-
portance. However, after a se-
mester’s trial, the traffic of-
fenses seem to be steady—no
better, no worse.
