Retired Dr. H. T. Lilly ~
Views College Library

By DONALD DAVIS
Davidsonian Assistant Editor
“The library is the central

work-horse of the college,"’ sum-
marized Henry T. Lilly, profes-
sor emeritus of English, as he
commented on his concern with
the Davidson College Library.
_ Lilly retired from the English
department last spring and at
the same time retired from the
chairmanship of the Library
Committee after holding this
position for 32 years. He was
a member of the committee for
35 years.

“I don't know why they let
me stay that long’ mused Lilly.
“I suppose they just felt sorry
fer me.”

According to Chalmers G.
Davidson, director of the Li-

"After Vespers

brary, this is quite to the con-
trary. ‘When Dr. Lilly came to
Davidson the library was housed
in the Carnegie Library which
is the present Guest House.

“Since that: time the Grey
Memorial Library and the addi-
tional Babcock wing have been
erected and the book stock has
increased from 40,000 to 110,000
volumes, ’

“At the same time the library
book and periodical budget has
increased from $3,000 annually
to $95,000 and the staff has in-
creased from two professional
members to four with five assist-
ants.”

While all this has taken place.
Lilly is always locking teward
the future of the library.

“We need very soon a new li-

“Goldfish Swallowing, Panty

a talk by-Dr. H. Harrison Jen- }
kins in Monday’s chapel. He will
discuss current American col-
lege student unrest in its his-
torical and international per-
spectives.

“As a locus,” said Dr. Jen-
kins, “I shall use an octet by
the American poet Vachel Lind-
say, ‘The Leaden Eyed.’ A 1912
verse. the poem deals with the
‘quaint deeds’ of young people.”

Dr. Jenkins is currently asso-
ciate editor of The Columbia (S.
C.) Record. A native of Colum-
bia, he was educated tn the Co-
lumbia public schools and was
graduated from the University
of South Carolina in 1941 with a
BA in journalism.

He received his master’s de-

gree in English from the Uni- -

versity of South Carolina and his
PhD in English from the Uni-
versity of Florida in 1957. His
doctoral specialty was Present-
Day English with a minor in

ways getting enough money, I

to get money for the library.”
sald Lilly.

Davidson also credits Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin with much
effort in obtaining funds for the
library. **President Martin is re-
sponsible for our getting $40,000
from the Duke Endowment for
the library recently which great-
ly increased the budget. He
is determined to keep raising
money for the library too.’

Dr. J. A. MeGeachy, profes.
sor of history has assumed the
position as chairman of the Ii-
brary committee. “Dr Me-

i Geachy is very interested in the ©

library,” said Lilly ‘‘and is very
capable in this position.”

Davidson remarked of Mce-
Geachy, “He is a fine seholar
who is very dedicated and is
very competent in this field.”

In additidn to his long service
on the brary committee, upon
his retirement Lilly presented
several hundred books to the
library. “Dr. Lilly gave us many
very useful books from his own
library and also gave some
books, which our library already
had copies of, to the library at
Barber Scotia College. This
shows Dr. Lilly’s high regard of,
scholarship and his long devo-
tion to the college,"’ comment-
ed Davidson.

Always trying to credit others,
Lilly remarked, “‘There are so
many people interested in the
library: Dr. (Malcolm) Lester
and Dr. (Frank W.) Bliss just
to name two who have worked
very hard along with Dr. Mc-
Geachy. I should really thank
Davidson because I have enjoy-
ed the library so much.”

DR. HENRY T. LILLY
Always Looking Toward The Future

HISTORY IS MADE

Johnston - Kimbrough
Wedding Is A First

The Sept. 4 wedding of Letitia

Dabney Currie Johnston, daugh-
ter of Dean Frontis W. Johnston,

and Lawrence Maury Kim-

borough, son of Professor John
T. Kimborough of the Math De-

partment, was the first mar-
riage in the history of Davidson
College to be solemmized be-
tween two children of members
of the faculty.

The: wedding took place in

the Davidson College Presbyte-
rian Church which was almost:

filled to capacity with numerous
friends and relatives of both
families, including former Pres-
ident and Mrs. John R. Cunning-
ham.

A reception at the home of
Dean Johnston, “Dogwood
Dale.” followed the wedding. It
was termed an event almost as
beautiful as the wedding itself,
being held in the spacious gar-
den adjoining the white-pillared
residence of the Dean.

One distinguished guest de-
scribed it by saying. ‘‘Mecklen-
burg has rarely witnessed a re-
ception which combined in one
evening so much society and
sobriety.”

For “Tish Johnston. her
marriage in the College Church
was a doubly sentimental occa-
sion, for her ties with the col-
lege are deep. Both her mother
and father attended Davidson

-| College, as well as both of her

grandfathers.

Lawrence, who is also a Dav-
idson graduate,, is not the only
Kimbrough to marry a member
of the “faculty family.” Three
years ago his sister. then Miss
Pattie Kimbrough, married Pro-

fessor Richardson King of the
Math Department.

Students May Receive
Income Tax Credit Soon

Students enrolling at David-
son in the future may receive
substantial deductions in the
form of tax credits from their
expenses for tuition, books, and
other essential fees under a
measure sponsored by Sen. Ab-
raham Ribicoff of Connecticut.

According to the Senator's
plan, those paying college tui-
tion would receive credit for
such expenses against their fed-
eral income tax.

Advocates-of the plan empha-
size the difference between a

‘tax credit and a tax deduction.

Each dollar of credit would re-
duce a person’s tax by one dol-
lar.

If a taxpayer owed $1,000 at
the end of the tax year and
had qualified for a $400 tax
credit, he would owe the. fed-
eral government only $600 in
income tax. A $400 tax credit
would save exactly $400 for the
individual, whether he earned
$5,000 a year or $20,000.

A deduction, on the other
hand, would save a $20,000-a-
year man more tax dollars than
a $5,000-a-year man.

places where a college exists,
the town is much larger. Fre-
quently a town and gown con-
flict develops.

“Davidson is unique in the
sense that the college is com-

pletely dominant.’ He question- .

ed whether or not the town could
operate aside from the college.

He then turned the tables and
proceeded to ask a series of
searching questions about stu-

-dent reaction to Davidson and

went on to propose the possi-
bility of research in this area.
“I would be very much in-

terested to know how students ;
from urban areas react to this,” :

he added. ‘Some of them from

places of 100,000 or so probably &¥

aren’t even aware that places
such as Davidson exist.’

a sociologist seemed to be the ;

one on that perennially favorite
controversy: fraternities. Hayes

The Ribicoff-Dominick Bill of

votes) is based on the first $1,500

Memorial Award
Given For Black

A Sandy Black Memorial
Award, worth at least $450 an-
nually, has been initiated. to be
given to the rising pre-medical
student considered the. most out-
standing by the administration
and. chairmen of the Depart-
ments of Biology and Chemis-
try.

The award was established by
Mrs. Sam Orr Black of Spar-
tanburg, S. C., in memory of her
grandson, Sam (Sandy) Orr
Black II.

Black, a son, grandson and

great-grandson of doctors, was
killed last spring in an auto
accident near the end of his
junior year at Davidson.

The award will be presented
annually at Spring Awards Day.

Fascinated With His Work

The amount of credit would
be 75 per cent of the first $200
spent. 25 per cent of the next
$300 and 10 per cent of the next
$1,000. The maximam credit al-
lowable would be $325.

Thus, based on 1963 figures.
a student paying tuition of $1,190
at Davidson would receive $294
worth of tax credit. or a 24.7 per
cent reduction In his tuition ex-
penses.

Opponents of the plan point
out that many schools: may hike
their charges to make up for
the student ‘savings.’ Other
groups. such as the National
Education Association and the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors, fear that the
government will begin to vote

missions. H. Edmunds White, the
Ribicoff plan and others simi-
lar to it “have tremendous pos-
sibilities.” The extensive pub-
licity which the federal govern-
ment can give such programs
can make them more enticing
to the public.

“Colleges have loaned money
for years, but the general pub-
lic was never in favor of bor-
rowing until the National De-
fense Loan Act made it seem an
acceptable thing to do,’’ White
remarked.

“A very significant advantage
of national scholarship programs
is the encouragement offéred to
students from low-income fam-
ilies,’ White continued. ‘‘Where-
as he might not be able to go to
Harvard, he is still able to con-
sider some college—a thought
which might not otherwise have
