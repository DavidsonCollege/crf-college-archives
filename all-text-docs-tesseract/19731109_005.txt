Davidson Turkeys Comprise
Foul Butterball Community

All right. It’s the end of the
term. Exams are a week
away. Nixon has astounded
the nation once again. People
across the country are
suggesting that he resign.

There's a fuel crisis. A loaf
of bread costs 43 cents.
Students under finals pressure
are starting to suggest jum-
ping out of third floor windows
with less and less laughter at
the suggestion.

Pollution is taking over the
world. My church (for the first
time in four years) has
forgotten to send me a ‘care’
package. The Middle East
cease-fire isn’t working.

It’s time for a serious
column. Let’s get the profun-
dities and/or trivia down on
munity dust off its thinking
cap.

It’s no use. I give up. I’ve got

At times like this, strange
ideas move into the brain and
settle.

Have you ever considered
the popularity of the word
“turkey”?

My aunt asked me if
“‘turkey’’ has an obscene con-
notation. I don’t know why she
asked me. I’m always the last
to know.

According to Webster’s
“New World Dictionary”, a
turkey is a failure or a flop.
Somehow the word has taken
on new meanings.

A turkey is notoriously

stupid. It’s the only bird which
is so dumb that it can drown in
arain shower. It raises itsbeak
to catch water and forgets to
lower it. If the rain is hard
enough, the turkey drowns.

The of the word
“turkey” is not merely one
who is stupid, however. A
turkey is the epitome of clum-
siness, egotism, immaturity,
snobbishness, and
hopelessness in general. A
person can be ‘‘successful’’
and still be a turkey. Success
is not a deterrent.

Davidson has more turkeys
than a Butterball Convention.
There is the turkey who sings
at the top of his voice at 3
a.m., and the turkey who yells
at him to get him to shut up.

There are turkeys who ask
how you did on a review, so
they can show you the 98 that
they made.

There are sports turkeys
and political turkeys and
professor turkeys and com-
puter turkeys.

In fact, there are so many
turkeys around here that it is a
common bond. It is what
makes us a community.
There’s nobody here but us
turkeys.

This is the great leveler of
caste at Davidson. It doesn’t
matter how smart you think
you are, or how dumb. It
doesn’t matter how important
you are, or how ignored.

You are somebody’s idea of
a prime quality turkey.

Davidson has finally found
itself in the search for ‘‘com-
munity.’’ Listen to con-

Investigation Reveals
Political Immorality

By SAMUEL D. MALONEY
Professor of Religion

The Watergate investigation of our perverted political
morality has presented the nation with a variety of insights. One
of the earliest confessions of ethical confusion came in the
testimony last June of Jeb Magruder, campaign director of the
Committee to Re-Elect the President.

Magruder explained how he had justified his own involvement
in various illegal activities because of the illegal tactics of anti-
war demonstrators like the Rev. Wiliiam Sloan Coffin Jr.,
Chaplain at Yale University under whom Magruder had studied

ethics

reasoned that if Bill Coffin broke the law,

. Magruder
Nixon aides could also break the law.
What Mr. Magruder did not discern was the not-so-subtle
distinction between Chaplain Coffin’s open civil disobedience to
the law and Magruder’s own covert violations in an attempt to

re-elect the President.

Bill Coffin did openly demonstrate against the war in Viet-
nam; he did counsel students to burn their draft cards and
evade the draft: Believing the Vietnam War was both unlawful
and immoral, he knowingly broke the law and willingly ac-

cepted the

consequences of his actions.

He was indicted with others in 1968 on the criminal charge of
to disrupt the draft; his anti-war efforts were sym-

conspiring
bolic defiance of law.

In working to end the Vietnam War and to change certain laws

that

that war and the draft, Coffin demonstrated a

basic respect for law. He was insisting that this nation live under

just and righteous laws.

A similar line of reasoning was used by Martin Luther King

Jr. when he

mingham, Ala. in 1963. King did not object to the law requiring
such a permit.He did object to the enforcement of this law to

versations that go on around
you. More than any other
description you'll hear is ‘‘He
(She) is a real turkey.’’

As you head down the last
week of the term, you’ll find
yourself surrounded. Your
fellow students will be
classified in your mind on a
one to 12 gobble scale.

As you get to the exam it-
self, you may even run into a
few flaming 12 gobble super-
nerdics. This (than which
there is no worse) type is rare,
but known to Davidson.

Keep in mind, however, as
your temper shortens and
your list of true turkeys
lengthens, that it works both
ways. Even while you classify
someone as a four gobbler, he
is classifying you as a six gob-
bler.

Remember before you call
fowl - the gobble you hear
may be your own.

THE GOOD OLD DAYS

JYA ‘Rubbish’ Criticized,

Grims Rivaled By

To the Editor:

Although JYA-Marburg was
worth far more to me both per-
sonally and intellectually than
any year or combination of
years I will have spent at
Davidson, I don’t really care
whether JYA is maintained,
because I don’t have much
hope or respect for Davidson,
and because I'll be gone in half
a year, anyway.

Nevertheless, Alan
Blakely’s last article on the
JYA program was such a mar-
velous exercise in pretention
and ignorance that I feel com-
pelled to attempt a rebuttal.

Because the JYA_ ex-
perience is incomprehensible
to those who have never been
overseas, Blakely is
criticizing something he does
not understand.

Blakely suggests a number
of alternatives to JYA: joining
the Navy, working in a coal
mine, working on a barge,
travelling a summer in
Europe, and attending another
US. university.

How many of these has
Blakely undertaken?

know that he does not
understand the JYA ex-
perience; how many of his

both?

Another of Blakely’s alter-
natives is traveling in the
summer to Europe. Again,
travel and JYA are not
mutually exclusive alter-
natives.

The essence of the JYA-
Marburg experience, that
which makes it invaluable, is
the unavoidable informal con-
tacts one makes with dozens of
students from most parts of
the Federal Republic of Ger-
many. Through these contacts.
and in the classroomone getsa
feel for the ideas, the in-
tellectual tradition, and the
lifestyle of young West Ger-
mans.

The average U.S. tourist,
who does the church-castle-
scenic view bit, invariably

Blakely complains about the
expenses of JYA to the student
and to the college. Actually,
the student pays much less.on
JYA than he would at David-
son. Room and board are con-
siderably cheaper (and
probably better) in Marburg
and Montpellier than at
Davidson.

JYA is much cheaper than a
year at Davidson and a sum-
mer abroad, because JYA
pays for the flight to Europe.

We Marburg returnees are
just as upset over high costs as
claims to be,

Taco Bell

judgement that cultural shock
for a Southerner is as great
in the American North or West
as in Europe is absurd and
reflects his lack of experience.

In other words, Blakely does
not know what he is talking
about.

Blakely clearly had no
business writing the article he
did. I am THE
DAVIDSONIAN prints such
rubbish.

To the Editor:

Every bit as deserving of
public attention as the need to
impeach Richard Nixon is a
growing phenomenon that, if
left unchecked, will soon out-
class the Food run or even the

chain, such Mexican delights
as buritos, frijoles, en-
churitos, and, of course tacos.
