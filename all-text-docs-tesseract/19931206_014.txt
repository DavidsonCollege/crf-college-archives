Cats take

wrestling
titles at VMI,
Pensacola

By Matt Pitzer

After seven years with nobody
winning a tournament, wrestling
coach Tom Oddo saw freshman
Miles Miller win in the VMI tour-

nament Nov. 13.

That win was impressive
enough, as were the three wrestlers
that won the following week in
Pensacola, Fla., but more impor-
tant is what those wins symbolize:
the strengthening of the entire wres-
tling program.

With the whole team back
from last season, plus three seniors
who spent last year abroad and a
talented freshman class, Oddo feels
that the program is close to becom-
ing consistently competitive on the
Division I level.

One of the signs of that is that
not all of the returning starters are
guaranteed their positions this sea-
son, as freshman and other upper-
classmen fight for those spots.

“Tt’s a good problem to have,”
Oddo said, “butit’s a stepping stone
to building a good program.”

Sam Knowles, Jimmy
Stewart, and Robbie Fierro all re-
turned from a year abroad for their
final season. Oddo expects the
three, Knowles in the 158-pound
weight class, Stewart at 190, and
Fierro at 126 and 134, to assume
leadership roles on the team. In
Pensacola, Knowles won his first
tournament ever at the college
level, after reaching several finals
and falling just short.

Along with Miller at 167, the
other winner in Florida was fresh-
man Aaron Kenner at 126, show-
ing unexpected success from two
first-year wrestlers. ©

“Although they are still young
and relatively inexperienced,
they’ve preformed really well out
of the blocks,” Oddo said.

Other top wrestlers should in-

clude: Jason Deaton at 118, Sean
Harvey and Steve Duncan at 134,
Francis Mitchell at 142, Miller
Carey at 142 and 150 (when he
returns from a broken hand suf-
fered the week before the first tour-
nament), Jared Glick at 158, Derek
Spencer at 177, Tom Greene at
190, and Osric Prioleau as heavy-
weight.

Oddo feels he needs another
season of growth and another
strong recruiting year before the
program will be at the level he
desires. “We’re still relatively
young compared to most Division
I schools,” Oddo said, “but we
have more depth and experience
than we’ve ever had.”

The team jumped out to a fast
start with its better than expected
results in the first two tournaments
of the season.

“We are starting this season
with confidence,” Oddo said, “in-
stead of trying to catch up during
the season like we did last year. It
has already showed in the tourna-
ments and it will start to show 7 in
the dual matches.”

Virginia threepeats

By Will Cobb

The University of Virginia
arrived in Davidson for the second
year in arow with only one thing in
mind--to leave with the school’s
fourth national soccer champion-
ship. They got what they came for
by defeating Princeton 3-1 on Fri-
day and South Carolina 2-0 in

‘Sunday’s championship game be-

fore a record setting crowd at Ri-
chardson Field. The victory gave
Virginia its third title in a row, an
accomplishment never achieved in
college soccer.

The first game on Friday fea-
tured the #3 Cavaliers and #22
Princeton University. Princeton’s
inexperience showed early as Vir-
ginia struck quick with its first
goal only 3:14 into the game as
tournament hero Nate Friends got
a perfect pass from A.J. Woods on
a breakaway, finishing from 12
yards out to take an early 1-0 lead.
Thirty minutes later, the two would
team up again when Friends gath-
ered a rebound off a Woods shot
for an easy goal. Virginia would
strike once more before the half as
Friends completed the hat trick off
an assist from Damian Silvera. The
3-0 halftime lead would be all Vir-
ginia needed, but the Tigers would
not quit. Despite a poorly played
first half, Princeton showed a lot of
character and pride, getting on the
board 12 minutes into the 2nd half
when Jacob Dowden headed the
ball past goalie Jeff Causey off a
cross from Mike Busch. Despite a
few more scoring threats, Princeton

was unable to pull any closer. “I
am very proud of the way our team
played in the second half,” said
Princeton coach Bob Bradley,
“When you are nervous and not
playing well, a great team like UVa
can really punish you.” Virginia
tightened their play to hold on for
a3-1 victory and atrip to the cham-
pionship game.

The second game featured a
physical match-up between South
Carolina and Cal State-Fullerton
that ended with 36 fouls. The Ti-
tans were making their first ever

appearance in the Final Four while
South Carolina was making only
their second trip, the last in 1988.
The game proved to be a defensive
battle. Of the 16 shots, only 4 were
saved. The teams remained score-
less until only 8 minutes remained,
when junior Greg King took a
throw-in from the sideline that
midfielder Billy Baumhoff flicked
to reserve Jamie Posnanski, who
placed the ball past a helpless Ful-
lerton keeper. The Gamecocks
held on for the 1-0 victory, sending
them to the NCAA finals for the

first time ever. This victory gave
South Carolina their third opportu-
nity to win a national champion-
ship in school history; their last
opportunity was in 1977, when the
baseball team finished 2nd in the
College World Series.

After a rain-filled Saturday,
the skies cleared for the champion-
ship game featuring two contrast-
ing styles in South Carolina and
Virginia. The game appeared to be

Landis looks back on his first

- By Matt Pitzer

When a shoe company coined
the slogan “Just Do It,” it must
have had in mind people like head
football coach Tim Landis.

The first year coach doesn’t
want anybody to make excuses for
anything, instead he just asks his
players to hit the field and prove
themselves.

“At the beginning of the sea-
son,” Landis said, “we stopped
complaining about what we didn’t
have on the team and built on what
we do have. .. . We said to stop
talking about what we could do
and said let’s go do it. There would
be no excuses, which in a way
became our motto for the season.”

And what a season it was. The

Waymouth, swimmers on roll

__ By Staff Writer

This season’s diving teams are
flourishing under the leadership of
new coach Marsha Waymouth.
Waymouth is a graduate of Indi-
ana University and a former quali-
fier for the Olympic trials on the
ten meter platform. She has
coached at Division I Utah State
and is currently a gymnastics in-
Structor at the Lake Norman
YMCA in addition to her position
as Davidson’s head diving coach.
Diving captain Thad Reece de-
scribes the team’s response to
Waymouth as extremely enthusi-
astic.

Reece, Henry Neale, Michael
Hart, and Andy Borleski all have
excellent records this year. They’ve
racked up six “sweeps”--taking
first, second, and third place on
both the one meter and three meter
boards--against Howard, William
& Mary, Mary Washington,
Radford, College of Charleston,
and VMI. Reece and Hart have
taken to calling themselves “the

one-two punch” representative of
their tendency to place first and
second.

Meg Bently and Tiffany Sauls,
both sophomores, have been scor-
ing points for the women’s team.
Down from six divers last year, the
two are working hard under
Waymouth’s leadership. Bently
considers her second place in the
Chapel Hill meet as her strongest
accomplishment.

._ Diving is scored as one of the
individual events in a swim meet.
The performance of the divers is
integral to the overall record of the
Swimming and Diving Team.

Reece described the meet
against College of Charleston as
the most rewarding of the year. In
last year’s meet, Charleston scored
twice as many points as the Wild-
cats. This year Davidson gave them
a run for their money, losing by
only four points. The points con-
tributed by the divers’ sweep in
that meet were vital to the team’s
overall score.

season as head football coach

Wildcats finished the year 6-4,
marking the first time since 1979
Davidson has won six games. The
team was this close to winning
seven or even eight games. But
speculating on what might have

been is exactly what Landis, who |

deserves a good deal of credit for
this season, doesn’t want.

“We were in a lot of games
and you can say that if we had just
gotten a couple more breaks we
would have been 8-2,” Landis said.
“Well, you can also say that if a
couple breaks go the other way we
could lose a few more games.”

Landis, an assistant for two
years under Dave Fagg, got into
position to take over the head
coaching position this season by
winning. After being an all-con-
ference quarterback and pitcher at
Randolph-Macon, he went to
Morrisville, Pa. where he was the
town’s high school football coach.
In 1989, he was named the county
coach of the year by the local news-
paper when his team went 8-2.

Four years later, and at the
young age of 29, Landis now holds
the job he dreamed of for many
years after growing up in Princeton,
N.J., where his father was head of
the physical education department.

“This is a dream come true for
me,” he said. “I always thought
that I’d have to go somewhere else
to become a head coach. At 29,

many people will say he’s awfully

lucky. Well, I guess I am.”
He also said that his age was a

source for extra pressure, the theory
being that if he faltered early, he
might be shown the door more
quickly
than ‘an
older,
more: ex-
perience
coach.

If that
pressure
was there,
Landis
handled it
calmly,
even if the week leading up to first
game, a 7-3 loss at Sewanee, was a
little nervewracking.

“I usually don’t get too ner-
vous about'a game, but I didn’t eat
or sleep too much that week,”

-Landis said. “That was a real excit-

ing week. It was a relief to get the
game underway. To play so hard
and lose was too bad, but it was
good to see that we could play that
way because I knew that if we
played that way every week we
would win some games.”

And the Wildcats kept on win-
ning even through injuries to key
players such as Alden Smith and
Andy Stevenson. Whenever a
player went down with an injury,
Landis was particularly impressed
with the way the rest of the team
increased their level of play.

“The kids responded,” he said.
