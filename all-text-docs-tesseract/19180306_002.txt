“Fifteen” for the Juniors!

Camouflage in oratory and song, but

the most enjoyed was the camouflage in

reality at the concert and reception.

Spring and warm weather have not
proved that ‘‘Fire” is not attractive.

“Attractions often prove distractions,”
philosophizes one of our Staff.

Mumps and measles like molasses and
physics, it and not them, if you please.

Rain for Junior Speaking has been
inevitable. Many thanks for the delay.

“Shall they who lack the skill to form
their speech have skill to form the
state?” inquires Euripides.

‘WHISPERS.

The text from which we wish to
briefly scpeak to you is from the
Agamemnon by Aeschylus: “And yet a
people's whisper hath great might.”

This saying tho spoken by a pagan
thousands of years ago is of great signifi-
cance to us today. This week has seen
a number of our college men leave for
Training Camp. These men were draft-
ed. These men were candidates for the
ministry. Tho they may be blood-thirsty
yet they have this higher vision before
them. They went willingly. They re-
alized that in the future, should they
enter the ministry, they would have to
deal with men, many of them, who had
seen active service. If they had not
gone and had managed to get out they
would have been confronted with the
fact that their influence and power of
leadership was hampered. People would
sav you are yellow. cold-footed, and
without (the football term)—you
would not go with us to France and
you have nothing that can interest us.
Here is just where the whisper of the
people hath great might. Other candi-
dates who were not drafted have volun-
teered because they realized the potency
of the maxim of the old Greek.

To say what attitude a ministerial stu-

“AFTER THE SPEECH.”

dent should take, we cannot. Professors
are divided in their opinions as to this.
One faction says, “Get out if you can,”
while the other says, “It is not right to
try to get out, for it will cripple the
cause.” Both are downright dogmatic.
The student is between the devil and
the dark blue sea, If he could “get out”
and wanted to get out there should be
something to overcome this “whisper.”

The Government says stay in college.
Yer “the whisper of a people hath great
might.” To the virile college man above
the age of enlistment it should be shown
that it-is a patriotic duty to remain in
college, that is if the Government really
thinks so. Keep up the college, we must.
To keep them to a standard approaching
anything like the normal attendance
there must be something to overcome this
idea of being branded a slacker if a stu-
dent remains in college. A man with
as much backbone as the lowest verte-
brate—the amphioxus—is going to shun
doing the thing which generates whis-
pers. :

INDIVIDUALISM.

Old Bill Shakespeare made a touch-
down, knocked a home run, threw a
dozen goals, delivered a Junior Speech,
and preached a sermon in saving, “If
thou beest a man, show thyself in thy
likeness: if thou beest a devil, take ’t as
thou list.”

This is just individualism, which is
merely throwing all your powers into
whatever you do, think, or say. Presi-
dent Wilson once said to his class at
Princeton that if you- want to be the
meanest man in the world, be natural.

There is a great lack of this in col-
lege life. If we must be concrete the
Literary Society program is usually posi-
‘ive proof. Many debates are just like
the values of Tussig’s Principles of

Thru the courtesy of one of our re-
porters we are publishing a poem writ-
ten by the boys in the trenches. We
understand that this has never before
been published. We are glad to get
some real trench sentiment.

ME AND MY TWO THIN BLANKETS.
I'm here with my army blankets,

As thin as a slice of ham.
A German spy, I think, was the guy

Who made ’em for Uncle Sam.
How do I sleep? Don’t kid me—

My bed tick is filled with straw,

And lumps and bumps and big fat

bumps,
That punch me till I’m raw.

Me and my two thin blankets,
As thin as the last thin dime—

As thin, I guess, as a chorus girl’s dress.
Well, I have one heck of a time,

J pull ’em up from the bottom
(My nighties. my B. V. D.’s)

A couple of yanks to cover my shanks,
And then my tootsies freeze.

You could use ‘em for porous plasters,
Or maybe, to strain the soup;
My pillows my shoes when I try to
snooze,
And I've chilblains and cough and
croup.
Me and my two thin blankets,
Bundled up under my chin.
Yes. a German spv. I think, was the guy,
And, gosh, but he made ’em thin.

Dedicated to his majesty (?) “The
Kaiser,” with the hope that he will very
coon sleep without even this much cover.

O. C. Williamson, '18, Coyte Hunter,
"1a, and W. P. Davenport, ’20, have left
college, going to their homes, there to
await the order to report to camn.

Economics—you can prove most any-
thing you want by them. Some debaters
weave in a beautiful way what so many
supposed-to-be-authorities have to say,
and give little logic and reason. We
have heard of a reviewer or critic who
tried to inhibit the tendency in a student
for giving his own opinions. This does
not seem just. In a. debate one should
argue and give his own opinions with-
out making it purple with ego. One
should be more like old Ibsen and Bern-
ard Shaw, whose lives are individualism
incarnate,

There is no need of passively submit-
ting to everything if you do not like it.
There is no need of accepting some
theory because someone has said so if
you do not believe it. Stand on your
own bottom whatever the world says or
does, but stand with discretion.

CULTURE AND THE COLLEGE. Cornelius, N. C.

In the February number of the Book
News Monthly there is an article “Cul-
ture and the College,” which should be
read by every wide-awake college man.
Tt gives a picture of the college man and
his room in the past and today. It gives
the methods of the English professor of
yesterday and today. This is short and
entertainingly written. If you ever ex-
pect to teach English, by all means
read it.

BULWER-LYTTON.

What do you know about him? If
you want to read a good sketch of his
career you are referred to an article by
Edwin W. Bowen, of Ashland, Va., ap- i
pearing in the Sewanee Review. This
article is a review of a book started by|f
Bulwer-Lytton, added to by his son, and
completed by his grandson. His life is
an interesting one and is indicative of
one more than a conqueror.
