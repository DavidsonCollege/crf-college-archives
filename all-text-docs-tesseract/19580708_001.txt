Two Texan Tales -

(Enjoy them while you can. They will
soon be replaced by Alaskan tales: !)

A Texan was telling about teaching his
son to drive one of the fanily Cadillacs.
"But, Tex," interrupted a friend, "your
boy is‘only ten." "Shucl:s, Ah know
that," was the re,ly. “That's why Ah
only lect him drive in the hnousei"

And did you hear about the six-year-
olc Texan who pledzed >100 a week to
his church school? Sure that the lad
did not understand hat he was doing,

a member of the canvassin , committee
called on the yarents. "Oh, yes,"

the father assured him, "it's perfectly
in order. ‘le insist that the boy
tithe."
