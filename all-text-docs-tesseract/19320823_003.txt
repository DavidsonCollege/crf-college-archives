WM. S. DOWDELL, ’04

Davidson Alumnus at Helm
of N. Y. Cotton Exchange

Wm. S. Dowdell, ’04, Elected to This
Office in June. Has Been in
Cotton Business 25 Years

William. S.. Dowdell, 1904 alumnus of David-
son, has been accorded the unusual distinction
of being elected president of the New York
Cotton Exchange for the ensuing year, this
election taking place at a June meeting of
members of this exchange. The elevation. of
Mr. Dowdell to the presidency follows an active
participation in the cotton business for the past
quarter of a century.

The new Cotton Exchange president is a
native of Alabama, and after attending David-
son, he went to Alabama Polytechnic Institute.
On completing his education, he entered the em-
ploy of Weil Brothers, an Alabama concern,
and has been associated with that firm contin-
uously ever since. Mr. Dowdell comes from a
family which has been identified with the cot-
ton business in one phase or another in Alabama
and Georgia the past three generations.

This Davidson alumnus, in his work with
Weil Brothers, was in charge of developing
and handling the buying activities of this firm,
which work . took him on extensive trips
throughout the South. In building up and con-
ducting its selling operations, Mr. Dowdell-trav-
eled throughout Europe, and is one of the most

Prominent figures in the cotton markets of
this country,

Until’ 12 years ago, Mr. Dowdell had his
headquarters in Montgomery, Ala., but then he
went to New York to be manager of the New
York office of Weil Brothers, handling both
spot and futures business.

perience to make their performance worthwhile.

The difficulty is not in the backfield this
fall, for Gene McEver has a fine allotment
from which to choose his quartet. Each back-
field candidate will have to hustle this fall to
make a regular berth on the Wildcat eleven,
for in addition to the trio of veterans named
above, McEver will have Bill Flinn, the two
West brothers, Johnny Mackorell, Caton,
Wingfield, Dickerson, Fleagle, Clarke, Hutchins,
Hufford, Creech, Norfleet, O’Keefe, Bernado
and Bumgarner. Fully 20 men will be fight-
ing to obtain places in the backfield.

As passers, Mills, Pearce, Julian West and
Mackorell will be on hand. All of these, with
the exception of West, are punters, and in addi-
tion, Morgan, a strong Sophomore end candi-
date, can be called back ‘to boot the pigskin
for 60 yards or more in the pinches. Davidson
can almost offer a backfield entirely of triple-
threat men if such was desired. It may be that
McEver will divide his candidates into two
backfields of practically equal ability.

Greater difficulty faces Doc Newton, how-
ever. Experience will favor Buddy Gardner

Scott Candler Commands
Georgia American Legion

Selection for This Post Follows Long
Period of Active Participation.
Is Also Mayor of Decatur

Scott Candler, 1907 graduate of Davidson,
Was selected last June to be the 1932-1933 com-
mander of the American Legion of Georgia, and
his choice of leadership of this body was the
culmination of a continuous period of activity
in the annals of that organization since it
came into existence. Selection of Mr. Candler
also added to the important posts which he
already held in other fields.

In announcing the selection of Mr. Candler,
the Associated Press stated that he “had an
outstanding war record. He enlisted as a’ pri-
vate in 1917 and by November, 1918, had won
the rank of captain. He was a member of the
328th Infantry, Eighty-Second Division, A. E.
F., and» was in command of Compnay O of
that branch during the Saint Miheil and Meuse-
Argonne offensives. He was wounded in ac-
tion in the Saint Mihiel battle. He received

two citations for bravery beyond—the call of
duty, in the Meuse-Argonne battle.”

Mr. Candler is mayor of Decatur, Ga., and
recently embarked upon his 19th consecutive
term as director of that city’s affairs. His first
choice as mayor came shortly after the com-
pletion of his law course at the Atlanta Law
School, from which he graduated in 1913, six
years after finishing his undergraduate work
at Davidson. With the exception of the two
yearsthe spent in the army he has been actively
practicing this profession in Atlanta and De-
catur,

This active Davidson alumnus has been chair-
man of the Decatur City Commission for eight
years and served without pay on that body this
year in order to be eligible as commander of
the Decatur Legion Post. He served that post
as adjustant for the past three years. He was
chairman of the Georgia Legion’s membership
committee-during the past year.

In 1928, Mr. Candler was a member of the
executive committee of the Young Men’s Demo-
cratic League of Georgia and took an active
part in the presidential campaign of that- year.
He is.a tristee. of Davidson, and is also a
member of the trustee body of Agnes Scott
College in Decatur.

for the pivot position, though Lee will be push-
ing him for first choice, and will be a good
substitute when Gardner tires. Wootten, Batte
and Van Story are other center possibilities.

Whitfield and Wagner no doubt will get the
first call for tackle, but Hand and Siewers, and
one or two others will be giving them keen
competition. But when it comes to guards and
ends, there are complete vacancies. For the
latter, Morris and Morgan, Freshmen last fall,
have the inroad: Both are well over six feet
in height, both are scrappers, and it will be
hard for anyone to displace them if they con-
tinue their performances of last fall and in
winter practice.

Charlie Rives is almost sure of a guard place.
Rives was ineligible for varsity competition
last season, but worked with the Freshman
team, and showed unusual power. For the
other one, Fred Ogden has the inside track, on
the basis of his work in the winter drills, but
Potter, B. Forte and Brewer will: have much
to say about this.

Other line candidates include C. Forte, Greg-
ory, Nicholson, Miller, Cannon, Goodykoontz,
Jake Mackorell, Rice, Thompson and others.
