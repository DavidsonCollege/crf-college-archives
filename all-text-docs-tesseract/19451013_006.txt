Did J-J-J-J-Jeff get a date for
the Queens-Davidson Day? It seems
that he had. quite a time, but he
tried,

Potts thinks he can handle all
the surplus baggage this week-end.
More power to him.

Sally wonders if Bill’s trip to
Charlotte was so Hotsy. (I hope
you know what this means. I don’t).

Hills seems to have all his girls
on a string. He has two pictures of
a certain girl on his desk. Inci-
dentally, Spencer is interested in the
“sophisticated” picture on his desk.

Kappa Sigma

Last week-end the State of North
Carolina was entertained by a group
of Kappa Sigs. Their journies car-
ried them to Raleigh, Durham and
Chapel Hill. Scott, Boren, Wall,
Bailey/ and Masters are the boys
to watch from now on—to see that
they don’t collapse from fatigue. If
it happens just return their bodies
to the House,

“Egg-eater” Bailey seems to have
enjoyed himself over the week-end.
How many was it, Doc?

Current is still trying to explain
to his folks how the whole front
end of the car got smashed up. He
swears that he didn’t see it coming.
See what?

Talk about a disappointed lover
just take a gander at Boren. It looks
like Duke changes women for the
worse: when they go up there. “And
she was so sweet”, quoth he.

‘Touch football for the Kappa Sigs
so far has been pretty successful.
The team combined with the S.A.E.s
has won every competition so far.
So far they have been taking:it easy.
By that I mean the players go on

when they played the Phi Delts they
just used the second string line and
