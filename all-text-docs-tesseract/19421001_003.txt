Wildeats and the Rollins Vars at 8:00 o'clock in the tvening at
\merican Legion Stadium. The ‘Cats will be out for their first
win (and first Score) of the season, while Rollins, fresh from
a thorough trouncing of the strong P. C. team will be gunning

little over-confident, Davidson could do no _ better
than fight it out to a scoreless tie. Many are prone to
under-rate the boys from Winter Park again this year,
but word comes from the Floridans’ camp that they are
loaded, two fast, 170 pound ends (as heavy as ours), one
terr:.fic tackie, tipping the beam at 216, and the other no
baby at 196. both guards weigh over 190 in the raw
and are plenty rough. In the backfield Billy Justice,
i6% pound scooter, wiil be. the man to watch. He is
ciaimed to be “as good as Sinkwich” and will vie with
Davidson’s Artful Art Roach for running honors.
Coach Jack McDowell wants this game and wiil spare
no punches to do just that.

All this is intended to poimt out that Rollins will be no
pushover, The ‘Cats WILL have to tight all the way to. win.
