With very little left on
the sports agenda but con-
ference meets in tennis and
track, it’s time to look back
on a year of varsity athlet-
ics at Davidson. As far as
won-lost percentages go,
the record hasn’t been too
spectacular. The ’Cats won
53 contests while dropping
62 and tying two for a per-
centage of .453. In 1957-58
they broke even, 62-62.

In football, the old buga-
boo of late-season injuries
came back to plague Coach
Bill Dole, and the gridders
staggered out with a 5-4
record, a very presentable
mark in view of the obsta-
cles. The Wildcats lose on-
ly five men by graduation
and the outlook for next

- fall seems to be favorable.
Twelve lettermen return.

The cross-country squad,
led by stellar distance man
Angus McBryde, won three
and . lost three. McBryde
graduates but King Cole,
Larry McNeil, and David
Gilmour should be able to
take up the slack.

In its third year as a var-
sity sport, the soccer team
Fr produced an all-conference
player for the third season
in a row and _ finally
amassed a winning (6-5)
record. Ail-star Claude Fin-
nel returns help form a nu-
cleus of veterans.

Coach Tom Scott’s. bas-
ketballers struggled
through another losing sea-
son, but neverthelsss there
were bright spots. The 'Cats
at long last came through
in the Carrousel Tourna-
ment, licking Clemson, an
A.C.C. team. Davidson stu-
dents also came through
with their best display of
school spirit in an awful
long time, in cheering the
Wildcats to a _ near-win
against rough Wake Forest.
As usual the ’Cats played
well against the top teams
and were often uninspired
against the weak sisters.

By far the most success-

FINE RECORD

Coach Heath Whittle took a
6-2 season record and thirteen
men to William and Mary, feel-
ing that his team has a good
chance to place near or at the
top.

Angus McBryde is competing
in both the mile and two-mile
runs. Bill Eckbert is also run-
ning in the two-mile race. The
quartet of Chet Alexander,
Roger Beebe, Ed Kizer, and
Brownie Thurman, should be in
contention for first spot in the
relays.

John Huic and Henry Pharr

Dee Wins Both Games

PRESSLY

On their recent road trip the Wildcats lost a game
to W & L, but came back strong to beat W & M twice to
close the season. In.the game, Dee Lide went the route
for the Wildcats, giving up seven hits and four runs.

GREEN WINS FIRST

At W & M, the first game saw
Davidson take a 2-0 victory. It
was the first shut-out by a Wild-
cat pitcher since 1957. Dee
Green went all the way and ef-
fectively scattered seven hits.
Davidson scored its two runs
in the first inning. Killian led
off with a single and Bob
Groome homered over the left-
fielder’s head. Don Killian got
the only other Davidson hit, a
single in the fifth.

GREEN WINS SECOND

In the second game Green
pitched again and gave up three
runs on seven hits. The ‘Cats
garnered nine hits and scored
all of their runs in the same
inning. In the big sixth, Bynum
and Green led off with singles.
Harold Reagan tripled to drive
in two runs. Then Cole sin-

Wednesday, the team elected

Coach Stevens had the follow.
ing to say: “Killian, Cotton, and
Green have been our outstand-
ing boys this year.” He also
pointed out the lack of coor-
dination between hitting and
pitching this year. “Some games
we've had good hitting and
some games good pitching, but
seldom the two to7ether.” Team
