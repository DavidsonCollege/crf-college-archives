Bandwidth increases, but new problems surface

While heavy machines dug ditches and
constructions workers laid brick this sum-
mer, campus computer wizards worked on
another kind of renovation: the upgrade from
aT1 toaT3 Internet connection. Last semes-
ter, disgruntled students sat impatiently at
their computers, waiting with frustration for
a Web page to load or file to download. Upon
returning to campus, many were delighted to
see performance increase and wait decrease.
However, the problems of spring have resur-
faced this fall.

Last year, Information Technology Ser-
vices (ITS) and Business Services received

numerous complaints about what continues’

to be a growing problem for many educa-
tional institutions. The Internet connection
was simply too slow. Students and professors
trying to do Internet-based research were
hindered by the painstakingly long time it
took to load Web pages and download educa-
tional material.

“By middle of last spring, the bandwidth
was maxed out,” said Robert Norfleet, Vice
President for Business and Finance. This
problem was “compromising the ability of
students to get their work done.”

The school decided it was time to take
action. The Internet bandwidth was more
than tripled from last year’s three megabytes
per second (MB/s) to 10 MB/s this year.
However, the upgrade comes with a hefty
payment - $125,000 per year.

Testing over the summer showed that the
upgrade was a success. Unfortunately, as
students returned to campus, so did the prob-
lem. People once again reported slow Internet
performance, and the monitoring service for
the college web site (www.davidson.edu)

reported sluggish results.

The problem is simple: as more bandwidth
became available to students, they used more
of it. Monitoring Internet traffic has shown
that approximately 50% of the incoming traf-
fic is consumed by three protocols used to
share music and video files: KaZaA, Gnutella,
and IMesh. An even more startling statistic is
that these protocols consume over 75% of the
outbound traffic.
Adding to the con-
sumption of band-
width is_ other
Internet traffic, in-
cluding live video
streams, Internet ra-
dio, downloading of
video games, and
non-educational
software.

In order to facili-
tate educational uses
of the Internet, ITS
reduced the priority
on media protocols,
limiting peer-to-peer
file sharing to 10%
of the available
bandwidth at any
given time. Some
improvement was noticed in other Web traf-
fic, which accounts for about two-thirds of all
campus Internet use, but not enough to satisfy
all users.

“This is a problem everywhere in higher
education,” said Norfleet, noting that
Davidson is not the only college that will
have to find asolution to this problem. Norfleet
emphasized that the college provides the
Internet as a tool for expanding the availabil-
ity of information to students and faculty, and
not as a toy for entertainment. This does not

mean that students are not allowed to use the
Internet as a form of entertainment, but such
use should not interfere with its legitimate
use for educational purposes.

ITS has determined that increasing band-
width once again would be ineffective be-
cause the cost would be unreasonable and the
relative consumption of bandwidth would be
unlikely to decrease. The amount of informa-
tion transferred over
the Internet is increas-
ing everyday; so, too,
is student use.

The most feasible
solution involves co-
operation from all on-
campus Internet users.
ITS e-mailed the link
to their newsletter
(www.davidson.edu/
computing/network/
resnet/itsnews) to the
college community,
explaining the band-
width crisis and ac-
tions that should be
taken to improve con-
nection speed.

According to ITS,
Internet users should
use the Internet only when needed and elimi-
nate any unnecessary use. Minimizing the
use of media protocols such as KaZaA,
Gnutella, [Mesh, Morpheus, Audio Galaxy,
Lime Wire, and Bear Share would see the
largest improvement. By using these pro-
grams “students don’t realize their computer
is being turned into a server,” commented
Norfleet. “It makes students vulnerable.”

The use of these programs allows any
Internet user access to individual computers.
That is, anyone with the appropriate software

can scan through and download files from a
peer’s computer. This not only limits pri-
vacy, but also consumes an enormous amount
of bandwidth.

What many students and faculty may not
realize is that once the programs are turned
on, files may be uploaded from their com-
puter without their knowledge. These pro-
grams automatically share files saved to a
user’s hard drive.

The most recent ITS newsletter empha-
sizes that this sharing should be deactivated.
This action alone would greatly reduce the
consumption of bandwidth. Live audio and
video streams constantly consume bandwidth,
so it is suggested that live streams be only
used if essential. It is also suggested that the
Internet be used for entertainment purposes
during off-peak hour, from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m.
and Fridays and Saturdays after 9 pm.

Davidson Undergraduate Students can earn 16 or more course credits.
