A Wildcat batter kicks off the season against Wake Forest.

Baseball opens season with
loss to No. 15 Wake Forest

By RICHARD CONNOLLY

Last season, the Wildcats faced Wake For-
est in a home and home series and were
outscored 26-9 as the Demon Deacons won
their 11th straight game against Davidson,
an unbeaten streak that dates back to 1996.

Yesterday afternoon, the Wake Forest ball
club once again journeyed down I-77 to
Wildcat Park as both teams kicked off their
2002 campaigns.

Of special note, the meeting marked the
34th time Wake Forest Coach George Greer
has faced his old team.

Greer coached at Davidson for six seasons
from 1982-1987, and has experienced tre-
mendous success against the Wildcats, com-
piling a 30-3 record as head coach for the
Deacons.

Unfortunately for the Davidson nine, little
has changed over the past 12 months and the
15th-ranked Deacons cruised to a 7-2 victory
behind the solid pitching of sophomore Kyle
Sleeth (1-0).

“We saw one of the top pitchers in the
country today,” head coach Dick Cooke said.

“Sleeth was throwing consistently around
92 miles per hour, and he touched 95 several
times as the game progressed.”

Cooke handed starting duties to senior
Tim Frend (0-1) and the right-hander from
Maine kept the game close through 4 and 2/
3 innings before an errant throw opened the

» door forthe Deacons, who capitalized quickly

as Jamie D’ Antona cleared the bases with a
grand slam to give Wake a 6-1 lead.

“D’ Antona may be the best hitter in the
country at this point,” noted Cooke follow-
ing the game. “He got a good look at one of

Tim’ s two mistakes and made solid contact.”

Offensively, Davidson batters were held
to one run off six hits as Sleeth struck out 10
without*issuing a walk through seven in-
nings. ,

-“T thought we had a number of good at-
bats on the day, and we created several
scoring opportunities,” an optimistic coach
Cooke said.

“T was very pleased with our effort physi-
cally, we just need to tweak a few things
mentally.”

Wake Forest got on the board first when
Nick Blout laced a two-out, two-run double
off the right field wall in the second frame.

Davidson countered in the fourth as senior
co-captain Billy Ryan singled in fellow co-
captain James Marino, who had doubled
deep to center.

The Wildcats tallied another run in the last
of the ninth off a two out single down the left
field line by senior centerfielder Steven
Aldrich. Despite the loss, Frend proved his
worth on the mound yielding only two earned
runs, while striking out seven against just a
pair of walks.

“Tim pitched very well today, and I felt he
and Billy Ryan called a great game,” Cooke’
remarked.

Defensively, the Wildcats made good de-
cisions in the outfield, especially the perfect
relay involving right fielder Sam Navarro
and second baseman Eli Benefield, both
freshman, to cut down a runner at third.

Davidson returns to action on Friday, as
Brian Akin gets the nod against Delaware
State and the home stand continues through
the weekend when Big East powers Boston
College and Georgetown University cometo
town. ;
