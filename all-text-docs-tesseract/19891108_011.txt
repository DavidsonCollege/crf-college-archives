Failed two-point conversions doom
Davidson gridiron comeback in VMI game

By GIGGY MAXWELL

The final score was VMI
39, Davidson 36.

Butitshouldn’t have been
that close. Had the Wildcats
been able to do what Head
Coach VicGatto told them they
needed to do to win the game,
Davidson would have handed
VMI a rather solid defeat.

At the end of last Tues-
day’s practice, Gatto told his
team that VMI was a ballclub
that had had lots of difficulty
hanging on to the ball. They
were going to turn the ball over
several times on Saturday and
it was the ‘Cats job to not only
capitalize on those turnovers
but make sure that they stayed
in the game by not committing
turnovers of their own.

_ Gatto.was right. The VMI
Keydets coughed up the ball
five times, four times on
fumbles and once on an inter-
ception. The only problem was
that Davidson gave the ball
back to VMI three times on
fumbles of their own. One
Wildcat fumble, in the second
quarter, occurred on the play
immediately following a VMI
fumble. ;

Turnovers were. not the
only thing -that led to
Davidson's 28-7 halftime defi-
cit. Their special teams gave up
several big plays, including an

and a 57-yard kickoff return.

Davidson’s lone first} half

score was recorded on a Peter

that covered seven yards and .

To their credit, the Wild-
cats didn’t fold when they
came out for the second. half.

than the Keydets, and they _

were going to prove it.

ter saw the Wildcats drive to

stalled, Freshman kicker James

Brownopened the fourth quar-

ter by booting his eighth field

goal of the season, one shy of
the Wildcat record.
On VMI's ensuing series,

their quarterback fumbled the
ball away to Davidson at the
VMI20-yard line. The Wildcats
once again squandered a
golden opportunity as they
fumbled the ball back on the
very next play. The Keydets
then drove the ball 81 yards for
a score to increase their lead to
37-16. With 12:50 remaining,
the Davidson began its frantic
comeback. The ‘Cats took 10
playsand 4:10 to g0 66 yards as
Ralph Isernia picked up his
second score of the day. The
two-point conversion attempt
failed.

VMI 37, Davidson 22.

At the 7:12 mark Davidson
recovered another VMI

fumble, this time at the Keydet
29. Four plays later Hughes
found Isernia for his third score
of the afternoon. This time the
two point conversion was
good.

VMI 37, Davidson 30.

With 2:20 left on the clock
VMI faced a third and six at
midfield. DB Mike Carney,
coming hard on a blitz, hit the
backfield so fast that he inter-
cepted an attempted pitch toa
Keydet tailback, rambling 37
yards before being tripped up
on the VMI five yard line.

Three plays and one QB
sack later, Davidson faced
fourth and goal from the Key-
det 10. Peter Hughes found.

Mike Carney in the endzone
and the Wildcats now only
trailed by one, 37-36, with the
two point conversion still to
come.

The play was supposed to
bea pitch left to Isernia with the
left guard pulling to lead the
way in to the endzone for a 38-
36 Wildcat victory.

Unfortunately the pulling
guard didn’t and the pitch
went astray.

Isernia picked up the loose
ball and shuttle passed it to-
ward the end zone where it was
picked off by a VMI defender
and returned 90 yards for the

second safety of the day, an
NCAA first.

VMI 39, Davidson 36.

What if Davidson hadn’t
tried a single two-point con-
version and been successful on
all its PAT attempts?

Wildcats 38, VMI 35.

But that’s something for
people to argue about in the
offseason.

Rightnow the Wildcatsare
preparing for their final contest
of the season against Salisbury
State which will take place in
front of a Homecoming crowd

. at Richardson field.

Make sure you come out
and give the 1989 Wildcat foot-
ball team, in particular the
graduating seniors, the sendoff
it deserves.

definite that will happen. The
unsettled nature of conference

affiliation, the arrival of Terry.

Holland as athletics director
next May and the imminence of
Students’ college decisions are

all arguments for an approach
that doesn’t commit Davidson
to long-term action this year.

Caroline Brown, for one,
urged a cautious approach.
“We need to sit down as a col-
lege and discuss all our op-
tions,” she said.
