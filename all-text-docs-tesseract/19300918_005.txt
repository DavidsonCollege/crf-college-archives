THere are eight Freshman out for foot-
ball manager. This is one of the largest
Number to come out for this position, in
[the history of the school. This is a very
good showing for boys who have just come
‘into the college. AH of them seem to be
doing excellent work and it is hoped that
théy will continue to do as well. Football
_manager is the most coveted managership in
the school, but it is the hardest on the cam-
pus to get and the man that gains this posi-
tion clearly deserves it. The managers are
allowed to stay out until the cnd of their
Sophomore year and then all but three of the
imanagers are dropped, then at the end of
their Junior year the football lettermen vote
for these men to decide who is to be varsity
football manager and who is to be Fresh-
‘man football manager, the one receiving
‘the largest number of votes s to be varsity
football manager, the one receiving the next

‘largest number of votes is to be Fresh-
man foothall manager, and the other, man
loses out.

The following Freshmen are out — for
Freshman foothall manager: Wilbur Fugate,
Harold Eskins, Frank Holt, John Drake,
B. F. Ormand, W. A. Kirkland, Barry
Caldwell, and Albert . Colwell.

Davidson Five and
Ten Years Ago

Sept. 17, 1925—Record enrollment!

This year’s enrollment of 628 breaks even
the large enrollment of jast year by ten.
Of this number only four are co-eds and
ten are men who have been out of school
tor a while. There are still seven more
men who have made satisiactory arrange-
ments with the treasurer, but who have
tailed to register properly. Consequently the
number may increase to 635.

This number is in no way near the num-
her who applied for entrance to the insti-
tution. Approximately 225 men who applied
tor admission to the Freshman Class were
turned down for lack of class room.

lu spite of the present crowded condi-
tions, all of those upper classmen who were ,
in doubt as to their chance to enroll were
admitted and duly enrolled.

Sept. 17, 1920—New football coach.

Great was the: joy of the Davidson stu-
dents when they learned that Hugh Grey
was to be coach this year. Not only was he
one of our stars when in college, but since
his graduation has been turning out winning
teams at Bailey Military Institute. Coach
Grey became an alumnus of Davidson in the
spring of 19K, having been one of the best
all around athletes ever at this institution.
He played on the foothall team for three

years, being honored its his last year by ane

All-American selection. In addition. to his:
foothall, -he was a track star, winning his
“DD” -three tmes and setting records fot the
shot put and discus events.

Four New Homes Built

During Summer Vacation

, Students returning to the campus this fall |
havé doubtless noticed new residences loom-
ing on and in the vicinity of the campus.
Dr. Thos. W. Lingle. Dr. H. B. Arbuckle,
and Dr. €. kK. Brown have all built new
residences on the Concord Road about a
mile from the center of the campus, and a
home for Prof. Lewis B. Schenck has been
construéted on North Main Street by W. E.
Potts, contractor.

With these people moving out of the
houses they have occupied. others have moved
‘into them. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the
college. is located in the former Arbuckle
home; Fred W. Hengeveld, registrar, is in:
‘the Lingle house; Myron W. McGill, auditor,
(is occupying the home formerly used by
Mr. Hengeveld; Capt: F. M. Cochran, who
jis replacing Capt. John W. Elkins in the
»R. O. T. C. Department. will take the house
‘vacated by the latter. Capt. Nortoh G.
Pritchett, professor of Physical Education,
is undecided whether he will move. If he
does, he will take the home occupied by the
late Prof. Lb. B. Henderson. Dr. Price
Gwynn's decsion as to his location depends
upon what Captain Pritchett decides. Dr.
/Gwynn will either occupy the Henderson
place, the Pritchett house, or the former
Jackson house.

ABSENCE AFFETCS HOURS

(Continued from page 1)

for each sixteen absences which are on ‘the
permanent record, one semester hour will
he deducted from a student's total semester
hours, Therefore, for example, if at the end
of four years, a student has only 132 hours
required for graduation, and has 80 absences
[on permanent record, the number of semester
+ hours will be redtced by five and he will
have only 127 semester hours, five short of
the number required for’ graduation.

However, Dr. Sentelle emphasized that
since the administration desires to stress
‘quality rather than quantity of work, any
student who averages A in any course would
ihave all the absences which are recorded
‘on the permanent ‘record erased. Those av-
‘eraging B would have half.of the absences
on permanent record removed, and all grades
below B would have to suffer the full
amount. As an example, if a student should
happen to have even forty-eight absences .
iduring four years’ work, excused or unex-
icused, which have become permanent rec-
‘ords, and he averages A for four years in
all his courses collectively, he would not
| be affected by a reduction of semester hours.
| Of course, this example is only general. since
each course is treated separately.

A further discussion of the absence reg-
ulations is found in the booklet.
