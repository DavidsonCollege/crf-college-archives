Although few would doubt the importance
of appreciating diversity on campus, this
year’s Diversity Week programming has an
even stronger significance in these times of
conflict and terrorism, when people around
the world are dealing with the same fears and
feelings of coming together to preserve hu-
man rights.

“], like so many others, continue to regret
the fact that we need to have a Diversity
Week in this country and in this community
to remind us to appreciate our differences,”
’ said President Bobby Vagt.

“But I think that the week itself and the
programs that have been organized are really
extraordinary. I think it is too easy for those
of us on the campus to blow through these
events and not attend because of other things
and believe that we are sufficiently thought-
ful and liberated and we don’t need to attend.
I think everyone should attend or participate
in at least one event to make the week a
success.”

The week’s programming began on Satur-
day, when the atrium of the Union was hung
with flags from countries all over the world.
The annual International Student Festival,
the first event, was held in the building from
noon to 3 p.m..

The festival was organized by the Davidson
International Organization, and featured eth-
nic foods from around the world, perfor-
mances’of traditional dance and music and
countless booths describing aspects of inter-
national cultures, like acupuncture and lan-
guage. Just a few of the countries represented
included Spain, Mexico, ‘China, India, and
Bosnia,

Kim Gardner ’03, attended the festival, and

- said the event seemed “really successful” and

it was the “most involvement” from the stu-
dent body and the community that she’s seen.

Vagt summed up the significance of the
week’s programming, saying, “If ever there
were a time that we needed to celebrate not
only that which is different but celebrate also
the respect with which we look at those
differences, now’s the time.”

Pulitzer winner to give Kelley lecture

By Linpy BALDWIN

The History department’s Kelley Program
has brought many prominent historians to
Davidson’s campus; past guests have included
Princeton’s James
McPherson and UNC-
Chapel Hill’s William
Leuchtenberg. Even
among this distin-
guished group, how-
ever, this year’s Kelley
Lecturer, David Lever-
ing Lewis, is a
standout.

Lewis, currently the
Martin Luther King Jr.
Professor of History at
Rutgers University, is
a two-time winner of
the Pulitzer Prize for
biography.

He was awarded the
prize in 1994 and again
this year for his two-
part work on the life of
W.E.B. Du Bois, one
__ of the most influential
figures in 20"-century American history. Du
Bois, the founder of the NAACP, is consid-
ered the premier architect of the Civil Rights
movement; he was also a historian, novelist,
editor, and sociologist.

Lewis’ two volumes, entitled W.E.B. Du
Bois: Biography of a Race and W.E.B. Du
Bois: The Fight for Equality and the Ameri-
can Century 1919-1963, are a major rework-
ing of both Du Bois’ life and the history of the
movement with which he is associated.

The Washington Post has called the com-

pleted work “a dazzling feat of scholarship
performed with Lewis’s customary grace of
style.”

“As a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his
biography of W.E.B. Du Bois, Dr. Lewis
brings unusual stature to the lecture series
and to the campus,”
said Dr. Earl
Edmondson, the cur-
rent chair of the His-
tory department.

According to
Edmondson, “once
each semester the De-
partment of History
invites a noted histo-
rian to visit the cam-
pus under the aus-
pices of the Kendrick
K. Kelley Program in
Historical Studies,”
the same program that
supports the honors-
level Kelley Seminar.

“The overall goal
of the series is to en-
rich the intellectual
life of the College.
We hope that each
lecture will heighten interest in the debates
that the study of history engenders.”

Dr. Bob Williams, the director of the Kelley
Program, was equally enthusiastic. ‘“[Dr.
Lewis] will set the tone for a series of out-
standing Kelley Program lectures this year
and next.”

In addition to the two Pulitzers, Lewis has
also received a MacArthur “genius grant” to
fund his work on Du Bois. Despite these
honors, however, in an interview Lewis at-
tributed the attention to Du Bois’ importance

rather than his own skill. “What means the
most to me is that this person’s long life, the
battles he fought and principles for which he
stood, are getting the attention they so emi-
nently deserve,” said Lewis.

Lewis holds a Ph.D. in modern European
and French history from the London School
of Economics, an M.A. in-United States his-
tory from Columbia University, and
bachelor’s degree in history and philosophy
from Fisk University. In addition to his work
on Du Bois, he has written several other
acclaimed books, including King: A Biogra-
phy, When Harlem Was in Vogue and The
Race to Fashoda: European Colonialism and
African Resistance in the Scramble for Af-
rica.

Lewis’ lecture, entitled “W.E.B. Du Bois
and American Exceptionalism,” will be pre-
sented on Thursday, November 1 as part of
Davidson’s “Diversity Week.” The talk be-
gins at 7:30 in the C. Shaw Smith 900 Room.
