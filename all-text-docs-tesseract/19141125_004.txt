STRONG ADDRESS.
(Concluded from page 1)

Greek exercises in the book was that the

first of them had but two mistakes, and
by the end of the freshman year ’s work
not an error could be found. ‘The last
two or three pages weré devoted to per-
sonal accounts, and the sight of them
gave rise to a remark by Dr. Smith that
while he was in college it was whispered
that one man from New Orleans had
spent four hundred dollars in one year.
The average amount spent was consid-
erably under two hundred at that time.
Among the items entered in the note-
hook was a pair of suspenders at. six
cents, a wild extravagance, for why
should thev have cost more than five.

The price of board does not seem to
have been very much cheaper than it is
now, but railroad fare was about four
cents a miles, and a trip to Charlotte was
quite an item. The village streets were
impassible in bad weather, wagons often
mining just about opposite the new stores,
The path between the society halls was
almost as bad, and Dr. Smith is confi-
dent that the different stages in culture
could be traced now by the design of the
overshoes imbedded in the strata under
these places.

The principal sport was base ball,
though match games were few, and uni-
forms were unheard of. There was one
game in which Dr. Smith distinguished
himself. “The team had challenged
Charlotte, and a special train had been
run, bringing about four hundred people
up to see the game. Dr. Smith was
plaving shortstop near the grandstand,
and a ball coming toward him consider-
ably out of his reach, he made a leap for
it and won the game by catching it, but
the result to his clothes was disastrous,
and he was obliged to retreat hastily for
repairs.

College life was, of course, very dif-
ferent from what it is now. “The liter-
arv societies were the whole diversion in
anv organized form outside of the curri-
culum. But, considering the kind of
work done in that Greek exercise book,
little time went to waste,

COACH KS EXPRESS APPRECEI-
ATION OF SCRUBS WORK.

The success of the foot ball season has
been due, in a large measure, to the serv
ices of the faithful substitutes and scrubs.
The coaches are glad of an opportunity
to express their most sincere appreciation
to cach member of this faithful squad.

Their courteous deportment on the
field, their hearty co-operation and will-
ing efforts. in carrying out the instruc-
tions of the coaches, have been sources
of pleasure to us and have resulted in
great benefit to the Varsity.

The spirit of faithfulness to duty and
untiring effort is certain to be rewarded
by ultimate success and the assured pre-
sentation of the coveted foot ball “D.”

SENIORS COME BACK STRONG.

The Seniors won aver the Sophomores!
in basket ball this afternoon by a score
of 29 to 20. The Sophs outclassed their
opponents in the first half, piling up 18
points against the Seniors’ 6. The Sen-
iors came back strong in the last half:
allowing only one field goal to be scored
against them.

This was the last of the regular sched-
uled games, but the Seniors and Fresh-
men will have to play another game for
the class championship. The percentage
at present is as follows:

Won, Lost. P.C.
Seniors .. .. 6... 0 2 .666
Fresh .. 4 2 .666
Juniors .. 3 3 .500
Sophs .. .. I 5 .166

Owing to the hard times and the use-
lessness of the custom, the Pan-Hellenic
Council has decided that no flowers will
be given the visiting ladies here for Sen-
ior Speaking.

DAVIDSON SECOND ‘TEAM
TRIGMPHS OVER HORNER.

‘The Scrubs met. Horner in Charlotte
Saturday, and defeated them by a score
of 21 to o. “The game was fast and
hard fought in spite-of the large score.
and at times the Horner Lads held the
Scrubs for downs in the shadow of the
goal posts.

In the initial quarter Horner kicked
off to Davidson, and a march straight up
the field started. Finally Adams plough
ed through the line for the first touch
down after about five minutes of play
Then Horner received and Law threw
Morrison back for a safety on the kick
off. °

In the third quarter two more touch
downs were marked up to the Scrubs’
credit by Hill. He played a great game
making consistent gains during the en
tire game. Also the playing of Savad
and Critz. was fine.

For Horner, Morrison, Pressley anc
Hines plaved good ball, but their rea!
star was Orr. The line-up:

HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED 3

that in any game where a ball is
used in a compet-
itive way, that the
official ball always
bears this trade-
mark, whether it
be FOOTBALL, Sree
BASKET BALL, INDOOR BASE
BALL, LACROSSE, BASE BALL
or any other athletic game?

There must be a reason for this
universal adoption by the lead-
ing organizations connected with
sports, and there is s reason—no
one can make them as good.

The same argument applies to
all things athletic.
