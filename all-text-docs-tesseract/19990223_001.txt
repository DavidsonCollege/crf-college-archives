Year 4697, marked the start of the year of the
Rabbit.

Each year, Chinese all over the world cel-
ebrate the Spring Festival, known to us as the
Chinese New Year, with elaborate decorations,
food, and many other festivities. The Chinese
follow a lunar calendar, with a year divided into

twelve months, each of which is in turn equally
divided into thirty-nine and a half days. The year
is also divided into twenty-four terms, which rep-

the five-year cycle of the rabbit’s earth element,
which represents a year of intellectual activity,
justice, peace, and practicality. People born in the
year of the Rabbit are
thought to be sensi-

peace loving. They
also tend to value sta-

homes and family.
Rabbits are believed
to make good busi-
ness people, politi-

an important part of the festivities. Chinese homes
are generally decorated with flowers and various

visiting neighbors, and relatives. To prevent bad
luck from the previous year from carrying over,
people usually clean houses and dress up in new
clothes. The color red was originally used to ward
off Nian, the beast whose name means “year.”
