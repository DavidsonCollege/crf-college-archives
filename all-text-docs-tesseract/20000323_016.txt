Irwin Belk track to make its debut Saturday
Wildcats’ first home meet since 1990

By Grant BLEECHER

Track & Field Correspondent

In 1991, Davidson’s track was reduced
to three lanes in order to facilitate NCAA
College Cup at Richardson Stadium. After
nine years on the road, the Davidson Wild-
cats will host a home meet on Saturday.

Coming off their best

Chapman is no stranger to stellar perfor-
mances, having already blazed an outstand-
ing 1:57.27 this year in the 800 meter dash.

The Irwin Belk Invitational will be the
second meet in the outdoor season for the
Wildcats. This past weekend, Davidson joined
UNC, Bucknell, Wofford, Wake Forest, Duke
and others at UNC Charlotte. In his colle-

season in 20 years, the Wild-
cats are ready to show the
Davidson community what
it’s been missing.

provides the team with an arena to showcase
our hard work by delivering incredible per-
formances,” junior Keith Chapman added.

people can see him “get nasty.” Schernecke
recently set the indoor school record in the
200m dash with a time of 22.8 seconds,

offsetting the previous record, which was set
in 1997.

For the first time ever, Davidson is looking
to send some of its very own to the prestigious
Penn Relays in late April.

Coach Gary Andrew has suggested that
if the 800m runners perform well in the
coming meets, then they will be able to qualify
for the Relays.

Front runners for the trip to Philadelphia
include Dan Gibson, Davidson record holder
in the 800m, 1500m, and indoor 5000m; Jay
Jahnes who has delivered several heroic per-
formances, recently in the 800m and 1500m;
Keith Chapman; and freshman Jimmy
Swansborough. These Wildcats will be aim-
ing for solid times Saturday in their bids to
qualify for Penn.

Davidson’s two-time Track & Field
MVP, Brent Ferrell, hopes for the opportu-
nity to improve his personal bests and set
more school records.

“Thope we’ ll have some records go down
this Saturday,” Ferrell said. “The new track
is a truly wonderful facility—people should
see us use it.”

“The new track provides a medium for
some excellent performances,” senior Tho-
mas McElveen said.
