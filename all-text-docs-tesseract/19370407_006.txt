Rehearsals are not to begin until
the second week in May and all re-
hearsals will be short. No speak-
ing part will have more than 12 or
15 lines to a speech due to the great
number of scenes to be given. Re-
hearsals will not conflict with
academic work, Mr. Viehman em-
phasized. The participants will not

be called upon for costumes, for
these will be furnished.
Professor Fleagle is general

chairman in charge of the pageant.
The following faculty committee
heads have been appointed—by the
Centennial Committee:
Professor Mebane—Stage Con-
struction.
Professor. Fulcher—Lighting.
Professor Goldiere—Costumes.

Professor Erwin — Casting and
Rehearsals.

Professor Lyons — Scenery and
Properties.

Mr. Magill—Tickets, Seating and
Policing.

Mr. Fred Smith—Publicity.
On alkeof these committees stu-
dents are wanted and will be ask-
ed to serve by the chairmen. Mr.
Viehman will also select four or
five student assistant directors who
will aid him in production.
There is something you can

do to help.

tragedies, first, passive adaptation
when the individual takes life as it
comes and can't be bothered with
tottering worlds. They let it come
and let it go. Second, the way of
the sinning, when they live a sour,
sneering life, like a cynic criticizer
that makes no positive contribution
to life and does not take the in-
tellectual way of going through
life. These frequently become an-
archists or deadly murderers. Third,
the way of side-stepping. The sad-
dest way of side-stepping is sui-
cide and the commonest way is
drink. In other words, they run
away from the trouble. The cruel-
est way is dope. Another quite com-
mon way not recognizable is di-
vorce. He stated that he was not
taking the position that some di-
vorce cases were not justifiable,
but all too often divorce is a way
of side-stepping a tottering world.

Then, he stated, there is a right
way of facing a tottering world,
that is to accept the challenge and
to build anew. In the process of
rebuilding, the inflicted find satis-
factory results in life. The phil-
osophy of Christ and an inexhaust-
able source of power to keep on
going are ways to get away from
the other three undesirable methods
of facing tottering worlds.

Dr. Caldwell closed with a story
of a seminary student who had
found out that he would soon be
blind. He goes to tell his girl and
she refuses to marry him. He does
not fall, however, but he faces the
facts and builds anew. Dr. Cald-
well closed with a poem written by
this student.

Phi Literary Society
Selects Committees

The regular meeting of the
Philanthropic Literary Society
took place yesterday (Tuesday),
at which time there was an im-
promptu debate, and plans were
made for the remainder of this
year.

Various committee were ap-
pointed for next year, and it was
planned to have the election of
new officers held as soon as pos-
sible.

Because of the interest of the
members, it is planned to have
in the future a faculty member
as guest at each meeting to join
in the discussion and perhaps to
make a short talk.

Prominent Physicians to Be on
Future Programs

Alpha Epsilon Delta held its
last meeting on Friday, April
2 in the classroom of Dr. S.
C. Lyon.

This meeting was a_ business
meeting in which programs for the
remainder of the year were to be
discussed and planned. At _ this
meeting it was decided that all of
the forthcoming meetings would be
closed to the public and open only
to those belonging to the frater-
nity. In the past several interest-
ing lectures have been given by
several prominent doctors in this
vicinity for the benefit of Alpha
Epsilon Delta. These were open to
the public. :

They decided that for forthcom-
ing programs they would have some
internes from hospitals in Charlotte
and from Duke University to dis-
cuss obstetrics. They also asked
Dr. Lyons to give a short course
in embryology to terminate after
several meetings. Papers are to be
prepared and read by certain
members of the group from time to
time. Other prominent doctors are
to be asked to address the fra-
ternity in the near future

The date for the next meeting
has not been definitely set, but it
will probably be within two weeks
time.
