“Thirty” for the Old Editor

There are several regrets and more
apologies from the retiring staff, yet we
feel that we Have left the fate of The
Davidsonian in hands capable of setting
up the type with fewer stains of printer's
ink and other handicaps that are re-
sponsible for those regrets and apolo-

You have elected a capable person to
pilot The Davidsonian through the year
from a managing editorial staff of six
untiring workers who deserve quite a
bit credit for their contribution to
the newspaper. They are:° Joe Eve,
Jimmy Fulcher, ‘bill Lyman, Henry Me-
Intosh, Lacy MacLean, and of course,

of

led Ierwin, the new, editor-in-chief.

It has been a pleasure to work with
these men, and there is a bond existing
between us caused by common duties,
common complications, and common er-
rors. ‘The reward of friendships out-
distances all other acknowledgments of
achievement. :

But ten men could never put out a
newspaper. The co-operation of the
student body is the one thing that is
indispensable in editing one, and we wish
to say “Thank you for your patience and
willingness to help.” Needless to say,
it is necessary for it to continue in order
for the new staff to carry on.

And to this new staff, we wish the
best of luck for the coming year in carry-
ing out the motto, ‘For a better David-
son,”

TONY DARBY.

Be It Understood...

The purpose of The Davidsonian, in
relation to the student body at least, is
two-fold. First, it is a record of events,
or contemporary history of the college.
Second, it is the organ of student opin-
ion,

As to the accomplishment of the first
end, we the editors and staff of The
Davidsonian have contracted to compile

the various happenings on this campus
into the form, at least, of a newspaper.
If we do not deliver we and we alone
are responsible.

The second trust, however, lies di-
rectly with you. We invite, in fact, we
insist that you the student body take

yourself heard here on every question
that promises to create a ‘better David-

cations printed by small schools, the
