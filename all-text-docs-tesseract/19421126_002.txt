Thanksgiving at Davidson was dif-
ferent. It showed few of the features
which have come to associate with the
day. But it brought a sense of some-
thing intangible yet more real, something
less filling yet more satisfying. Could
we have learned a lesson from the
change?

taken, put in a welcome appearance at
the festivities celebratit\g the Dad’s Day:
week end at Davidson. a

That the fathers en joyed the occasion,
a the suggestion needed_turther testi-_ _
mony, was definitely settled by their
unanimous vote for a repetition of the
altair next year.

lts sponsors rather expected the par-
ents to pick a week-end featured by a
fogtball game and were amazed when
they voted the idea down in favor of a
quicter week-end.

Atypical comment pointed out that
the father never had a chance to see how
their sons livea when they were hurried
from game to boarding house to home
amid the bustle of a football crowd. He
seemed really to appreciate the oppor-
tunity of joining his. son in dormitory
room and more than one unhurried meal,
and of experiencing normal campus life :
according to an informal schedule which

imposed no requirements on either Dad
or son,

Thanksgiving Change...

Marked only, by a lengthened chapel
program and a boarding house turkey
Thanksgiving at Davidson produced
early ‘syinptoms of becoming the forgot-
ten day at Davidson.

The usual football game and trek home
or visit to the bountiful table of a friend
was absent from the celebration of
America’s most beautiful and significant
holiday for most of the students.

Absent also were thoughts of pump-
kin pies and cranberry sauce, of flowing
baskets of fruits and good things, of re
unions with families, members of which
are spread in all the queer corners of the
earth.

.__Yes. Gone from the observance of a_
serious and significant day in our crowd-—

ed lives were the superficialities of a.

heretofore disguised and-misrepresented
Cireus day.

°

Gone were things we now realize were
really unimportant. Gone were our idols
erected to Epicurius and his pleasure
worship. Gone were false ideas of luxury
and necessity, of joy and unhappiness.
of importance and simplicity.

Replacing them were prayers, perhaps

for many of us the fitst, of true thank-

_ fulness. Prayers of realization chat

much that we have so long held betore

eyes blind with “star dust” in reality is
of little consequence.

Prayers of true Thanksgiving for the
pure safety of our loved ones replaced
vain hopes of our selfish reunion with
parents. Prayers of appreciation for
our opportunity to enjoy a happy meal
in a room warmed at the hearth of fel-

-lowship thawed the chill of hate sur-
rounding thoughtless hearts. .

play. This, however, did not seriously

“~ mar the spirit of the occasion, for which

we wish great success on future occa-
sions.

New Impetus. =.

Those who did not read the announce-
ment whieh comes from Mr. Hengeveld
printed on the first page of this issue
might profit greatly by taking serious
wOtc OF It.

Although Mr. Hlengeveld refused to
conimient at all on the interpretation’ of
the communication, because he had re-
ceived no information or hint of infor-
ination as to such an interpretation, it
would seem that there is but one logical
conclusion ‘that farsighted students can
draw from the document.

Perhaps it comes under the head of
repetition of last week's editorial com-
ment t6 point it out, but we think the

point. important. enough to bear re-—
_pearmg.

‘Itis-our last’ wish to be branded as
rumor spreaders, which class we have
-oiten attacked here, but when the reserve
boards speak in terms of “not in good
standing” should a_ student's average
yeer below the mark which renders him
ciigible tor a degree, the emphasis ap-
pears to be obvious.

\n words of: one syllable, those who do
‘not have a “C” average at the end‘of the
semester -had better watch their step, if,
they wish to remain in school and be
considered for officer training. .

The drop in the student scholastic
standings generally as evidenced by the
.faternity average assumes even greater

proportions, perhaps, than we had anti-
cipated.

In any event a word to the wise should
be more than sufficient in this case, for

‘ot things is on the way out, and 4
New Order, capable in its niagni-
tude and significance of being com-
pared only with the Roosevelt New
Deal and Schicklegruber New Or-
der (note particulraly the Jatter),
is on its way in, riding the wave of
irresistible public opinion. _ Nothing
can stop it; its onward march will

sweep _alt obstacles Tronr in tron

of it. It is unconquerable.” So might
think a metnber of the Class of ‘46,
that class almighty, that. class be-
stowed with gifts divine—in plain
lunguage, the low-down freshmen.
This would seem-the case to any-
one not acquainted with the real
temper of .the Davidson student
body and the capable Court of Con.
trol, who might have scen the up-
start announcemelits left around by
mystical and doomed “Freshman
Court of Control” this past week.
Calling the freshmen to revolt, ta.
leave off wearing red caps, to walk’,
on the grass .until the fertilizer
screams, to break campus whenever _
and however they please, and to do
a_million other things that__would
-harrass and worry the institutions

would-be Byrons clutter the campus
with their nonsense, little realizing
-what the consequences will be.
What the decision of the Court of
Control avill be, we cannot presume
to say. We rather imagine its de-
cision will be sudden and drastic.
It Certainly should be—very, very:
drastic, But that must come in due
time and with due process of law, |
none of which at the present is any
of our concern. What we wilt try
to do is to impress-upon-the iresh-
—nan,—seriously, -and—from-a_ reason-
idle point of view, exactly what
they are undertaking ,to do, in
urying_to buck-tradition. The fresh-
man—“court*_is_attempting-a- very
radical thing. It’s nothing to be
proud of. Rather, it’s something any
real Dabidsonian would be ashamed
of: We hope the freshman class will
have the good sense to reject it.
In
this

the first place, members of
notorious “council” probably

it appears that the wise are the sel think they are burning their names

ones as far as an educational future is
concerned.

ting. They probably feel that they
are establishing at the beginning of
their leadership by taking over in
the face of “unbearable persecu-
tion” of the freshmen now. Soon, we
hope, they will awake to the regl=
ity that such noble sentiments dob.
‘go over so well at Davidson:

With very few exceptions, the
“real trouble-makers of -the (resh-—

they may have-their fun at times,

may not be able to see it now, they

know what its-all about.

Again, when the present freshinan
class gets to be upperclassmen
they will appreciate their puyition
now to a large extent, Whey will -
want the distinetion, exactly as we
do now, of being the only ones priv
ileged to walk on the grass; they
will demand spmeone to make their
trips to the laundry every week, just
vas we do now. Incidentally, one is
getting a bargain when he carries
the stuff one year, and rests three.
He probably does not appreciate
this now, but it’s nonetheless true,
and if he refuses to do his part notv,
you can't, in fairness, demand the
Class 6f 7 to do theirs.

‘Fhe third point is one of the most
powerful arguments of all, though

men regulations and the Court of
Control were not established tor

least, for the freshman’s benefit.
Nothing welds’ a class together so
citectively as a feeling of brother.
hood in the face of overwhelming
opposition. This the freshmen sys-
tem here tries to give you to a very
inild_ extent, when compared to
other schools. 1 grant you—it seems
a little far-fetchéd to say this, but

too many fine classes have aris¢n--=

to their freshman yegr. It's an argu-
ment that simply can’t be dverlook-
ed.
~ And lastly, Freshmen should stop
and think well before you try to
shatter 4 tradition alimost ag old as
the college itself. Not only at David-
son, but everywhere, the subjuga--
tion of freshmen hag been part and
parcel of educational systems. But’
particularly here, where tradition is
fundamental, it is better to fall in
line with freshman classes of a hun-
dred years and “take it with a
smile”, whatever may come. We
would hate to be a member of the
class that breaks such a tradition.

We ‘repeat, freshmen will prob-

ably think of this--as -the-—biggest-

bunch of “bull” they ever read.
Take it for what it's worth; but
think twice before going any fur-

ther. Don't get the wrong ideas

respected by the upperclassmen with:

But draw the tine between fun and
