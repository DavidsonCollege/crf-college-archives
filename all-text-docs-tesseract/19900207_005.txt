A drum roll pleeease ...

Ladieees (women?) and
Gentlemennnn ... present-
ing, your new sports editor,
starting next week
Bruuuce __ Balestierrrrrr.
(Cheers and immense noise).

But first, I get one last shot
(heh heh), or two.

Baker is open! I hate to say
it’s about time, but... it’s
about time. The complex has
afew new rules that didn’t
matter in Johnston. Biggest
of all is the ID requirement. If
you don’t bring your ID, you
can watch through the pretty
glass walls as your friends
play the variety of sports
available in Davidson’s lat-
est alumni-pleaser.

Also-sources say you have
to wear goggles if you want
to play racquetball (racquet-
ball?). You didn’t have to in

Johnston, but I guess the
administration doesn’tmind
us getting hurt when no one

walls and important con-
tributors walking in at any
moment, I guess we have to
wear the vision obstructing
pieces of plastic that pass for

safe’ les.

can see us. But with glass.

On the sports front

Burns’ parting shots

Next: It is time for Davidson
to hire a full-time wrestling
coach. Not someone who
works at another job all day
and then (with much personal
sacrifice, | am sure) spends his
afternoon coaching a strug-
gling program.

If we want to have a top
notch athletic department,
wrestling is a must sport (and
onein which wecancompeteat
a high level).

Trecently talked to a former
wrestler, a freshman, He wasa
highly ranked grappler in high
school who received a scholar-
ship from another school. He

did not know Davidson had a

program until he got here.
You can’t have a good team
with mediocre recruiting, or
for that matter, with four wres-
tlers. Iam not denigrating the
guys that bust their buttsevery

day in the wrestling room, but

they need a real program.

- Next: Several weeks ago I
asked you to give me ideas for
my column. Someone took me
up on that suggestion this
week. A guy onmy hall walked
by and said this (note, thisisnot

my idea): “Why doesn’t the:

school try dropping football
for, say, five years, developing

~

the other programs, get-
ting intoa conference and
then, if warranted, bring-
ing football back. What
do you think?”

After picking my jaw
back up off the floor, I told
himI'd putitin the paper.
Now, your turn, getsome
discussion going, is that a
viable alternative?

Last: “Dick Harter
sucked, but couldn’t
Steinbrenner ...er, mean,
Shinn have fired him to
his face? Wouldn't it be
great if the owner could
get fired by the City of
Charlotte or something?
Asmuchas|hatetosay it,
Rex Chapmanisa spoiled
brat.

Good luck Bruce, she’s
all yours.I’llsee the restof
you occasionally on the
opinions page opposite of
Lucia. :

Or maybe in place of
Lucia...hmm...

..One more thing, Bruce,
make sure you give the
Wildkittens equal cover-
age next year (ha ha ha, I -
kill me).

As Bart would say: so
long, dude.

looks ahead

By ROBERT GRUBB

The men’s tennis team
opened what promises to be a
challenging season witha diffi-
cult tournament over the week-
end. Fifth-ranked South Caro-
lina, fourteenth-ranked
Clemson, fifteenth-ranked
Kentucky and top 30 North
Carolina joined Lander (S.C.)
and Davidson for the Davidson
Indoor Invitational.

Davidson Coach Jeff Frank
acknowledged that the field
was extremely tough. “I told
the guys that this was strictly
for experience and _ practice.
We didn’t really have any ex-
pectations against teams like
this, especially early in the sea-
son,” said Frank.

Unfortunately, the team
played as expected. Davidson
had a difficult time in both the
singles and doubles.
Davidson’s top player, Tim
Hagood was the only first
round winner in the main
draw. Hagood beat Ben Brad-
shaw of Clemson, but was
eliminated in the second
round. He was entered in the
consolation draw, where he
lost to Mark Pauls of South
Carolina. Pauls went on to win
the consolation draw. Fresh-
man Albie Varoski also madea
strong showing. He lost his
first round match, but ad-
vanced to the semifinals of the
consolation.

Charles Jordan also played
well, defeating John Venison of
Kentucky 6-1, 6-1. The Wildcat
doubles teams did enjoy much
success over the weekend. All
four doubles combinations lost
in the first round. Frank attrib-
uted this partly to the fact that
the team is still working on
developing its strategies.
Davidson’s' number one
doubles team of Kurtis Zabell

and John Beyer lost 6-3, 6-3 to

Stephane Simian and David
Hopper of South Carolina.
Simian and Hopper are ranked
tenth in the nation. Simianalso
won the singles, beating his
partner in the finals.

For Frank, the tournament
was also an opportunity to see
his players in a match. He in-
tends to use the results to deter-
mine his lineup for the begin-
ning of the season. With the
loss of last year’s number one
seed, Sebastian Koch, the Wild-
cats are left witha top group of
several players. According to
Frank no one has clearly domi-
nated. Injuries to Zabell and
Joey Manibo during preseason
practice have also prevented
Frank from coming up with a
concrete lineup. “Hagood will
likely play number one for us,
because as a senior he has the
experience necessary to play
there,” said Frank. “Varoski
will probably play second. |
really wouldn’t want a fresh-
man higher than that.”

A group consisting of Zabell,
Jordan, Beyer and Manibo
closely follows Hagood and
Varoski, and will likely see
most of the action in the singles
slots. However, Franksaid that
nothing was permanent be-
cause there are at least three
players that can challenge for
Starting positions. “Elijah
Gowan, Gary Wheeler and
Dale Voeks.will.all likely play.
this year,” said Frank. “Ifa guy
has a few bad matches and one
of these guys has been playing
well, we'll make changes. This
should keep everyone on their
toes.”

The outlook for doubles
seems to be clearer. Zabell and
Beyer team up at number one,
followed be Voeks and
