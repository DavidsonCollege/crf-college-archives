Wildcat Harriers stumble

By DAVID HULL
Staff Writer

While most Davidson stu-
dents were enjoying a lazy
Saturday afternoon at the
football game, Sterling Mar-
tin’s cross countrymen were
running for their lives amid a.
mob of 500 runners at the
annual Stone Mountain Road
Race in Atlanta.

Among the teams running
the five mile course, the
Wildcats finished in the lower
bracket. Their overall record
dropped to 0-2 as they lost a
dual meet with Georgia State

Doug Horn was one of the
few bright spots for the Cats
Saturday, finishing 36th in the
overall contest and second in
the dual meet. His time of
25:39 was a record for a
Davidson cross country run-
ner over a five mile course.

Rounding out the top five
for Davidson were Ed Ander-
son, George Strobel, Zack
Murrell and Jay Silver. Jeff
Morrow, Tom Scott, Vasili
Carperos and Biff Umhau also
ran for the Cats.

‘Anderson was very im-
pressive and Strobel, .a fresh-

man, will consistently be in

our top five. Morrow, another
freshman, has definite possi-
bilities of breaking into the top
five,’ Martin said.

The schedule this year is the
hardest Davidson has had in
years. Martin says, however,
“‘Despite our lack of depth,
our team can compete with
any of the teams on the
schedule.”

This may be a hard year for
the cross countrymen, but
Martin is optimistic about the
future because there is a good
nucleus of runners to build on.

ED ANDERSON leads the charge
