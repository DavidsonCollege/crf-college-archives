Rugby Ends Fall With Win

Over Duke,

By Tim Harris

The Davidson rugby team
ended its fall season Saturday with
atough, 16-6 loss to St. Andrew’s.
The fall slate began witha series of
challenging matches against Ap-
palachian State, Johnson City and
Wake Forest, but ended with a
surge of momentum.

The team putona fine show of

Loss To St.

rugby Parents’ Weekend in a 3-3
tie with Western Carolina, and
followed it up with a comeback
upset of Duke, Trailing 11-0 at the
half, they stormed back in the sec-
ond half to shut out the Blue Devils
and win 16-11. Wyatt Lilly and
Mike. Cruise each recorded a try
(score), and Jamie Brown kicked
two goals.

Andrews

Considering that more than
half the team is comprised of
newcomers, the team showed
remarkable improvement. Re-
turning players made up the core
of the team, but freshmen filled
in at a variety of positions. The
new players developed quickly,
and their continued interst should
lead the team into a strong, com-
petitive spring season.

should be a lasting varsity program. But a thrown-together club team
cannot expect to play Division I basketball, and Davidson will not at-
temptit. This year’s schedule includes home and home series with Spar-
tanburg Methodist, Brevard, Meredith, Barton and Warren Wilson, and
single visits to Eastern Mennonite and North Greenville. The home
season begins with a scrimmage against Catawba this Tuesday.
