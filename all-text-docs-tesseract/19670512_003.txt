Council Termed
Unrepresentative

ED. NOTE: THE DAVIDSONIAN asked
Mike Bates to describe some of the criticisms
which have been brought by different students
against the present Student Body Constitution.
This article is his description of some of the

criticisms.

A major criticism of the present Student Body
Constitution is that its Student Council ts not large
enough to represent effectively the entire student
body. The Student Council has had 15 (sometimes 14)
members continuously since 1896, when the student
body was far smaller and more homogenous.

Obvious omissions from representation on the
Student Council are the Union Board, the Interfra-
ternity Council, the YMCA, and the Social Council.

This lack of representation causes the criticism
of fragmentation, for the constitution does not en-
courage coordination between different student

groups.

. The present constitution establishes represen-
tation on a Student Council based almost entirely on
classes. This method of representation was estab-
lished in 1896 when a student government was
formed at Davidson. However, today classes have
very little meaning at Davidson. Many suggest that
some representation should be based on the resi-
dence hall system.

Another criticism is the lack of structuring in
the executive-legislative branch. The latter simply
establishes a 15-person council with a vague and
weak statement of duties. No standing committees
are provided for in the constitution, and none in the
by-laws provide for a regular and thorough review
of all areas of student concern.

Many criticize the committee system of the by-
laws as disorderly, incomplete and weak. The by-
laws themselves show no pattern, for they were
added at irregular intervals to meet specific pur-
poses.

Many feel the need to adjust the present con-
Stitution to take advantage of new representation
provided for by the faculty constitution. If the fac-
ulty-student councils come into being, additional
changes will have to be made.

These councils may be the first step toward
common faculty-student government of many areas,
and the present constitution does not appear to be
structured to permit or encourage these changes.

Nowhere in the present constitution is there
provision for the Student Body to disapprove and
stop an action by the Student Council, except by
amending the constitution. Nor can the Student Body
initiate legislation or recall an inactive representa-
ive.

The election system leads to exténded elections
of several exhausting weeks, during which student
interest tends to fall. Critics of the present consti-
tution suggest numerous improvements which could
speed elections and increase participation.

A very important criticism of the present con-
Stitution is the weak and incomplete nature of its
preamble and statement of purpose. There is no
statement at all in which the relation of students
to faculty and trustees is made clear, and the gen-
eral assumptions on which the Student Body oper-
ates are completely ignored.

Instead, the Student Council is given the empty
purpose of “furthering the best interests of the Col-
lege.” There is no statement of rights and freedoms
which students claim (a bill of rights). Critics of the
present constitution cite most frequently its general-
ly weak tone and the absence of efficient structur-
ing. -

A_PRESENT_ AND FUTURE DESIGN

Constitution Revision Starts

By ED EMBREE
Managing Editor
Major revision of the present Student Body Con-
stitution currently being considered by the Constitu-
tion Revision Committee of the Student Council is be-
ginning to take some vague shape. ;
Following this spring’s Student Body elections the
Student Council responded to the call for revision of
the constitution which had been a part of several presi-
dential candidates’ platforms.

Senate With 30 Members

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer
The chief alternative to the
present Student Council which
is now being seriously consid-
ered by the Constitution Re-

vision Committee is the senate-
executive committee form of
student government.

The Senate would tentatively
be composed of the four stu-
dent body officers. elected by

A Bill Of Rights’

The committee also has ten-
tative plans for a student “bill
of rights” partially. based on
standards set by the Ameri-
can Association of University
Professors. The guarantees
would probably include many
of those present in the Honor
Court trial procedure.

Few changes seem to be
projected for the Honor Court
and Regulations Court. Both
would remain independent of

any Senate control, except that
the Regulations Court would
rule on constitutionality.

Of the five committees which
parallel the faculty commit-
tees, the Committee on the
College would be most import-
ant and would have the broad-
est assignment. Roughly cor-
responding to the Blue Sky
Committee, this group would
review all phases of college
life.

the student body: the presi-
dents and vice-presidents of
the four classes and the sec-
retary-treasurer of the senior
class, elected by their respec-
tive classes: one representa-
tive from every residence hal!
on campus except Belk. which
would have either two or
three: one representative each
from the IFC, Social Council.
Union Board. YMCA, IMAC.
and Independents, each elect-
ed by his organization: the
freshman adviser, elected by
the senior class: and the treas-
urer of the Senate, elected by
the Senate from the student
body.

The Executive Committee
would be composed of the four
student body officers and three
other members elected by the
Senate from among its mem-
bers. Its principal duty would

“THIS SECTION IS INCREDIBLE”

be to prepare agenda for the
Senate meetings and to hear
and discuss committee reports
and to pass them on to che
Senate with its recommenda
tions.

This form of government
would be more representative
and would give more students
a chance to participate in stu-
dent government. It would
create a central organization
with added power to which
other organizations could look
for leadership.

In doing so, it would provide
a better opportunity for the
coordination of campus organ-
izations and would probably
give the students a stronger
voice. .

Some opponents of the plan
claim, however, that perhaps
one organization ought not to
have so much power.

The council] appointed the committee from a list of
applicants and Mike Bates was appointed by Council
President Tom Earnhardt as chairman.

In order to facilitate study and revision the com
mittee has divided into three subcommittees studying
different aspects of student government. The first sub-
committee is studying the student judiciary, the pream
ble, and amendment and adoption procedures. Sub-
committee II is considering several proposals for a
student legislative body in addition to election pro-
cedures. The third subcommittee is studying the com-
mittee structure in a revised constitution.

The committee is now beginning to formulate some
definite proposals and according to Franklin Anderson,
secretary of the committee, hopes to have “a rough,
rough draft” by the end of school.

Anderson further commented, ‘We are in. a transi-
tion period with change occurring in many facets of
campus life. We want to design something that will
work both now and in the future, and we must consi-
der the recent Faculty Constitution as well as the pos-
sible changes resulting from the Blue Sky report.”

Once the Constitution Revision Committee has
completed its work the new constitution must be ap-

parailel faculty committees, and are designed for study rather
than action. This diagram is still incomplete because the Re-
viston Committee is still considering changes and additions.

Taking Shape

proved by the Student Body. Council President Earn-
hardt outlined the steps the Council will take in seeking °
approval for the constitution.

Discussion of the new constitution in the entire
Student Council will be followed by a series of Open
End discussions to receive criticisms.

The proposed constitution will then go back to the
Student Council for final revisions. A two-thirds vote
of the voting students will be necessary to ratify the
new constitution, which will be presented as an amend-
ment to the present constitution.

Earnhardt stated that, “one of our goals in this
new constitution will be finding an official derivation
of power,”

“One possibility for such a derivation is a state-
ment similar to one in the constitution of the Princeton
Board of Trustees. This statement recognizes the
Princeton Undergraduate Council as “the official rep-
resentation body of the undergraduates.”

According to Steve Oxman, president of the Prince-
ton Student Body, who spoke to the committee Wednes-
day, the Princeton constitution states that the student
government's power is “derived from the students
alone.”

The Constitution Revision Committee meets twice a week in
efforts to rewrite the Student Body Constitution. Before each
committee meeting, each subcommiltee is required to meet to
prepaie its proposals. Committee members are Fletcher Hart-

soll (L.), Peter Hobbie, Bud Couser, Chairman Mike Bates,
Secretary Franklin Anderson, Mike Powell, and, not pictured,
Bill Watson and Ben Cannon. (Staff Photo by Olson)

Lack Of Change Marks
Student Council History

By DON HOYT
Staft Writer

Dr. Chalmers Davidson.
popular authority on Davidson
College. claims the students
during his undergraduate
years. exercised a great deal
more power than do students
today.

Although he was not sure
whether the power had been
granted to the students or
whether they had seized it.
Davidson did say that he felt
increasing faculty control has
stimulated the current inter-
est in formulating a new con
stitution for the student body.

In investigating the history
of the present constitution,
THE DAVIDSONIAN found
that actually there have been
very few answers to the prob
lem of student government.
There have been basically two
constitutions, the present plan
being in operation since 1937.

In the 1800's the individ-
ual classes and their re-
spective presidents had ju-
risdiction over any matters
brought before them.

The classes could expel stud
ents for offences such as
cheating and stealing. but. as
the Spirit of the Wildcat points
out, ‘the freshmen and sopho-
mores were not as wise as the
upperclassmen in exercising
this governing privilege and
hence many mistakes were
made that were unnecessary.”

“As a result of this ineffi-
ciency, in 1896 E. H. Bean of
Salisbury suggested a student

government for the college.”
This suggestion met with ap-
proval, but under the ensuing
agreemeit “the student body
met only on rare occasions.”

E. H. Bean was a fore-
runner of the modern aglita.
for, having come to David-
son after being disillusioned
by the war—in this case the
Mexican War

The 1897 Quips and Cranks
says: ‘The venerable Eugene
Holmes Bean is a relic of some
fossiliferous age of long ago.
After the war our aged veter-
an in a true ‘Weary Willy’
fashion ‘indulged in a Rip Van
Winkle sleep on a farm near
Salisbury. N. C., until Septem
ber. 1893. He awoke refresh
ed from the fatiguing exper-
ience and imagined that time
had rolled back many decades
and that he was again a boy.
Laboring under this marvel.
lous illusion, he entered Da
vidson...

The first president of the
Davidson student body was
Archibald Currie, a man who
had made a ‘wonderful es-
cape from the horrid lot of the
generality of Freshman” (sic)
by means of his ‘withering
dignity.”

The student. body, however.
remained generally unorganiz-
ed until 1910 when C. R. Wil-
cox, who was described by the
annual as being ‘‘a complicat-
ed mass of influence. geniality,
and horse sense.’’ set up the
student council using the same

basic form that it has today.

During the Twenties the hon
or system, which seems’ to
have had no formal beginning.
but rather an existence en-
twined in college tradition.
was incorporated into the con
stitution.

The jurisdiction of the honor
court became too broad, how.
ever. as was obvious from the
1923 addition stating that there
would ‘be no playing of must-
cal instruments from 7:30 to
7:30." and during the follow-
ing year the. present Honor
Code was adopted.

The first Wildcat Handbook,
distributed in 1924, informed
the incoming freshmen of a
fifteen member student gov-
ernment, the. purpose of which
was ‘‘to perpetuate and main-
tain the high standard of con
duct for which this Student
Body has ever been justly re-
spected."'

{t Is, perhaps, a sign of
the times that the preamble
to the present constitution is
less magnanimous, propos-
ing “to provide student self-
government, and to further
the welfare of the Student
Body .. .”

The March 3. 1937. issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, besides
announcing the engagement of
C. G. Davidson, reported the
student body's approval of a
new constitution by a vote of
323 to 7, although there were
10 votes against the regula-
tion's prohibition of alcohol.

The paper did not mention
the number of students voting
against the provision read
ing, ‘*No student shall be guilty
of leading an immoral life.”

The new constitution made
few important changes. Its
main contributions were pro-
visions for a well defined elec-
tion procedure and the election
of a freshman adviser.

The foliowing year, 1938,
the constitution saw the first
of a series of minor changes.
The Wildcat Handbook of
that year notified the fresh-
men of their newly-gained
right to vote in elections dur-
ing the second semester.
This issue of the Handbook
also advised the freshmen to
“avoid the use of tobacco.”' an
admonition which unfortunate-
ly was placed opposite a cig:
arette. advertisement.

Since 1951 there have been -
seven minor changes in the
constitution, perhaps indicat-
ing a growing dissatisfaction
with the constitution.

That students are now con-
templating a complete revis-
ion. plus the fact that fn the
past decade or so there have
been frequent irritations need-
ing correction. indicates a
steadily growing interest on
the part of the students.

Perhaps the constitution of
the. future will reflect a so-
ciety other than the one of the
nineteenth century. of which
was said. “Card playing and
drinking of intoxicants is al-
most unknown.”
