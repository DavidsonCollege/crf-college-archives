Students at Freshman Reception

and Ted Jones are Two-Minute
Speakers

The biggest social event that has |
occurred at the opening of college
this year was the reception given
the Freshman class by the Y. M. C.
A. at the college gym last Monday
night. Since no monitors were on
duty to check the rolls, no one knows |
whether every Davidson boy was|
present, but judging from the large,
enthusiastic crowd that was milling
over the floor, a hundred per cent
representation of the student body
turned out to extend to the Fresh-
man class the fellowship and good
will of the older members of the stu-
dent body and of the Y. M. ¢
Each year’s progress is begun by a
Freshman Welcome, but the grand
entree of the class of Twenty-Seven
into the activities of the college, and
her organization, was the biggest}
reception the old Alma Mater has)
experienced in a number. of years,

Upon entering the reception hall,
which was draped_in the Red—and
Black of Davidson College, the mem-
bers of the student body, and espec-
ially the members of the Freshman
class, were received by the members
of the faculty and their wives, who

New Watts Dormitory Is
| Outstanding Im Improvement

/Changes Are Made « on Campus.
Watts Will Be Completed at an
Early Date

Of the many improvements made
around the campus during the past
summer, the most important to the
welfare of the college is the building
of the new Watts dormitory. | Dr.
Martin made the announcement late
last spring that bee George Watts,
of Durham, N. C., had very kindly
given the Revere funds to rebuild
the burned dormitory. Work was
soon started on the new building
and, although the construction was
held up by unavoidable delays in get-
ting material, the building is near
completion.

The design and construction of the
new Watts is very similar to that of
ithe 1 new dormitories, East and West,
with a few exceptions. The new
Watts is about 15 feet shorter than
East and West dormitories, and it
accommodates about 100 students,
or 20 less than the other new ones
accommodate. In order to lessen
the noise in the corridors of the new
Watts, the contract calls for the lay-
ing of composition flooring over the
cement in the corridors. The steps
leading to the. upper floors ‘are of re-
inforeed concrete instead of steel
and slate, as in ast and West, and

Court of Control Makes Plans and
Regulations For Control of Freshmen

Court Introduces Ne New Features to|
Regulate Conouse of Freshmen

Since the permanent abolishment !
of hazing in Davidson College and}
the installation of the Court of Con-
trol as a means of governing the
Freshmen, only success has follow-
ed the work of that body. And it is
hoped that the student body: will
continue to support it as they have
in the past. To give the students
and friends of Davidson an idea of
what has been-accomplished we take |
this opportunity of making a brief;
report of the work of the past vear,|
and beginning of this one.

From the institution of the Court
of Control early in the fall of 1922.
to the end of the school year in June
1923, there were 88 Freshmen sum-
moned to appear before the Court
for discipline. A number of these
were called twice and some of them |
three times. These figures are suf-
ficient proof that the court was not
inactive during its infancy, and that!
it received the loyal support of the
student body, without which no such
report could be made.

But the Court of Control is glad
to be able to say that it does not
estimate its success in the number of
penalties placed on the Freshmen.
Though the idea conveyed by the
word “Control” stands uupermost in:
the mind of the outsider, those who
are better informed know that this
has become secondary, and that the
court does not see its future oppor-
tunities limited to a bundle of pen-

First Y. M. C. A Service
Featured By Three Talks

Hillhouse Address Large Crowd
At Vesper Service

short talks featured the
initial Y service of the year held in
Shearer Hall Sunday evening. The
program was in the nature of a wel-
come from the Y to the student
body in general and to the new men
in particular.

Ted Jones, president of the Y. M.
C. A., was the first speaker, sum-
marizing the ideals of the associa-
tion in a few well chosen, words as
a man’s organization of which every
Davidson man is a member, and
whose chief end is to save souls. ‘He
emphasized the admirable qualities
of courage, strength, leadership, and
spiritual power to be found in Christ,
the Master and Leader.

Following: this, Albert Hillhouse,
president of the student body, made
a forceful talk, calling to every man
at Davidson to stand this year, more
than ever before, for Christ and His
principles. He put the challenge
straight from the shoulder to-every
professing Christian to fly his colors
this year. He used the parable of
the talents to urge faithful and dili-
gent work and support of all David-
son activities.

The general secretary, Mr. John
P. Wiliams, of the class of 1916, who
was president of the student body

Freshman Class Presents
Galaxy of Dumb Ones

New Men Represent Remote Ex-
tremes and Perplexing Paradoxes,
Writes a Scribe

The class of ’27 is indeed one of
remote extremes and dumb-found-
ing paradoxes, Its the oldest and
the youngest, the largest and the
smallest, the loudest and the dumb-
est, and at the same time the most
verdant and yet the most rankly
ignorant of all Freshman classes.

The-class has attached to it the
numeral 1927, which is undoubtedly
intended to indicate that its origin
dates back to a more remote age
than any previous class which has
ever entered the sacred precinets of
these halls of learnings, or watched

a single one of its sacred edifices. |
There are various facts, however,
which to men of wisdom and dis-
ferimination, such men for instance
| who. choose Camels rather than
Spark Plug, and wear only the most
aristocratically advertised and cost-!
ly: raiment, which, to these men, as |
Was said, are quite indisputable |
pproof, that the date 1927 has been)
hand ever shall be erroncously ap-
plied to the present Freshmen class,
jand gives altogether a false impres-
ision, ‘These various facets are en-

|tirely too numerous to dwell upon)

an annual feature of Tall calendar.
\Vny form of stage entertainment
will be given a tryout, and Profes-
Erwin and Dendy — will help
coach the stunts and assist new men.

mittee, composed of Ted Jones, Lis-

Two Gridirons. Baseball Diamond
and Quarter Mile Track Building

Richardson Athletic Field, the
new thirty thousand dollar stamp-
ing-ground of the Davidson Wild-
cats is fast nearing completion, and
when the last pebble is taken off,
and the last seat in the stands ready
it will be one of the finest athletic
fields in the South. The new field
located on the same site of old
Sprunt Field, but it is much larger
and more commodious, The new
field affords complete accommoda-
tions for the three major sports:
football, baseball and track, It
enclosed by one of the latest spike
top metal fences. Privacy will be
maintained by means of hedges and
shrubbery which will be planted
just inside the fence.

The genearl plan of the athletic
field is as follows :

In the extreme north corner is the
| varsity baseball diamond, As yet
this part of the field is incomplete
so the details of its construction are
not very familiar, The infield is
located on practivally the same spot
that the diamond occupied on Sprunt
Field,

Directly to the southwest of the
baseball diamond is the varsity foot-
ball field which also will be rounded
into shape soon. The field is equip-
ped with the latest improved metal
goal posts so constructed that the
supporting posts are set a yard be-
yond the actual goal line. The field
