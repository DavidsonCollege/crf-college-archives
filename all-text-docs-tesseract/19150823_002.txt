This Announcement Number brings
a message to the old men and to the
It tells of the events of the sum

new.
mer, as connected with Davidson,
tells most of all, at the prospects tor the
rapidly approaching new year, the events
of which are ver to he recorded.

It is a wondertul-oportunity which is
offered to every man on the campus. For
the old men, it is an oppartunity to re:
turn to incomplete tasks and to take up
their work with renewed vigor. “To the
men who have heretofore fallen short ot
their best, a Aew opportunity is offered
and in ng place is failure more quickh
forgotten’ and effort and success given
more ready acceptance, than on a cul-
lege campus, and especially at Davidson.

To the Freshmen, it is often a time
for putting away of childish things. An
opportunity is offered you to be “men.”
The close care and = supervision which
has surrounded many of you will be in
a way withdrawn and you will be ex-
pected to stand upon your own feet. A
cordial fellowship awaits you,, but close-
ly joined with fhis feeling is one that
each new man is being tested. In many
cases, your entire college course will de-
pend upon the first few days and weeks,
and too much care cannot he given to
the conduct and speech of this period.
Mix in a friendly way with all, bus
don’t get mixed. The best and closest
friends are gencrally not the easiest or
the most quickly made. It is useless to
give detailed advice, if this were possible.
for to each man different advice would
be given. But a clear-head and common-
sense will carry you through most diffi-
culties.

There are few pleasures greater than
the meeting of old friends and the mak-
ing of new ones and as this season at
Davidson rapidly approachees, there ‘s
the ever-strengthening desire on the part
of all who will in any way be a part of
the college for the coming year, to tuin
their steps toward Davidson. To all a
cordial welcome is extended.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. August 23, 1915

DAVIDSON SPIRIT.1

Renewing of college friendships is an
experience to be fully appreciated only
by those who have passed through it.
‘The hearty handshake and the — glad
“howdy” are manifestations that hearts
are beating true and warm. As a Junior
or Senior clasps the hand of a Suphomore
he sets on fire a love and affection icr
everything and everybody, that re-
membered after sines and co-sine, have
been forgotten,

Let us then, fellows, not suppres this
feeling but encourage it and let it find an
outlet in the characteristic Davidson
“pep” which has always been the yoy and
pride of students and alumn:; the fear
and admiration of our rivals.

Is

Vo the Editor of The Davidsonian.

After two months of very pleasant
work for Davidson College in the east-
ern part of South Carolina, it is easy for
ine to decide what was most gratifying.
Kefore my canvass 1 did not believe that
dur alumni were as loyal as many would
have us suppose, buc [I am convinced
that they are more true to the college
than ever before. I found the same spirit
and “pep” in the alumni as is shown the
night before we play the University of
North Carolina, in Charlotte.

The one thing that pleased me more
than any other was the high regard in
which other college men hold the stu-
dents of Davidson. Not once did I hear

any college man say anything that would.

reflect discredit.on them. instead, there
were always expressions of praise for
every phase of the college's life and
work. It seems, ta me that the place
given us by our college rivals ts — the
strongest advertisement we have. |

know of alumni of other colleges who

are sending their brothers to Davidson.
Particularly is Davidson respected — by
our strongest rivals, and the coach of a
team who played at Davidson last fall
said that the Davidson team and entire
student body were the most gentlemanly
set of college men he had ever had rela-
tions with,

The young men entering Davidson
this tall: have a right to expect great
things and IT am sure will uphold its
traditions nobly and well. ~

To the Editar of The Davidsonian.

During the past eight or ten weeks I
have had the pleasure of seeing a num-
ber of the Georgia alumni, friends and
patrons of Davidson College, all of
whom seem to think, regardless of the
closeness of financial matters, that the:
vear 1905-16 will be one of che greatest
in the history of the institution. The
attention of many young men contem-
plating entering college this fall has been
drawn from larger institutions to Dav-
idson, due to the fact that Davidsen,
with a student body of about 350 men,
is doing things in intercollegiate work
which equals that of many schools of
600 to 1,000 ‘men. Yours,

P. D. Patrick.

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS.

Returning students will be impressed
with the fact that the campus was never
prettier. Considerable work has been
done on the trees this summer, re-
moving dead branches, filling cavities,
and treating scarred places.

The Social Center Room, in the Y.
M. C. A., which was discussed last
Spring. has materialized. Workmen are
busy now putting the building in order,
Handsome club room furniture has been
purchased and it is expected to arrive
before ‘opening of college, so that the
toom may be christened with the Fresh
reception.

Other important improvements have

been made on the college plant—the | peeeeee

residence occupied by Mrs. Campbell
has been overhauled, a new porch add-
ed, and the house repainted. “The halls
of Georgia, Watts and Rumple have
been calcimined and the wood work
painted, adding much to the attractive-
ness of these dormitories. “The radi-
ators have been bronzed and the mat-
tresses repaired. “Fhe Chambers build-
ing also has been gone over, the walls
calcrmined and the rooms on second and
third floor South Wing stocked with
new furniture, consisting of double deck
iron beds and other furniture like that
in Georgia and Watts. .

Contractors have been busy this
month installing steam heating plants
in the Martin Chemical Laboratory and
the Shearer Biblical Hall. A new boiler
is heing put in the Laboratory and the
Shearer Hall will be connected with the
central heating station.

The tennis courts east, of the Chemi-
cal Laboratory have been graded, re-
surfaced, rolled, and laid off anew. In
order to give more room between the
court and backstops the courts have been
run east and west. It is expected that
these courts will be kept up by the Ath-
letic Association and that they will be
open for any and all students to play on.

Sewer lines have been extended to ac-
comodate the residences on Concord ave-
nue and an iron sewer laid to replace
the terra cotta line which gave trouble
last year on account of hedge and tree
roots. -

NEW FIELD SECRETARY.

‘The announcement that Rev. J. C.
Shive, of Wilson, N. C., has accepted
the office of Field Secretary for the col-
lege will take up the work with the
opening of the new term, that is the first
of September, is agreeable news to all
friends of Davidson that know anything
ot Mr. Shive and his work both in the
pastorate and in the field ot service simi-
lar to this which he is entering now in
behalf of Davidson.

While the financial side is to be em-
phasized and Mr. Shive will) primarily
endeavor to increase the endowment
fund of the institution, he will not limit
himself to this, but will seek in’ every
wav possible to present the claims of
Davidson to the natural patrons of the
college and to extend its influence and
power for good throughout all the ter-
ritory in which the college has any right
to consideration and favor.

Mr. Shive for the past six years has
had charge of the Wilson church. Un-
der his leadership the church has grown
very much in point of membership and
in the increase of contributions to all
the beneficent causes. The Sunday school
is well organized and strong and the
church in all of its departments of activ-
ity is full. of life and vigor. That Mr.
Shive should be willing to give up a
work in which he is meeting with such
marked success is a convincing proof of
how important he feels the cause of
Christian Education is and how deeply
and vitally interested he is in it. The
friends of Davidson have no doubt. that
he will bring into his new work the
same zeal and enthusiasm and kindling
interest that he has always shown as a
minister and pastor. And not only so,
from time to time, Mr. Shive has
dropped out of the pastorate in earlier

therefore as a novitiate or beginner that
he enters the field as a representative of
Davidson in particular and of the cause
of Church and Christian Education in

was not a labored argument, but it con-
sisted of two most significant words,
“Try It.”
