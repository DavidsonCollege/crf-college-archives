Zimmermann show opens

Mackinlay .Zimmermann (yes, he's really Price’s brother) has tried many
careers. From the Army, a California radio station, a Northern life insurance
firm, and a manufacturing company where he resigned the position of
vice-president, he returned to.school as a graduate student in ceramics.

Since then he has taught, prsently works as a studio potter, and is now.a
member of the Tennessee Arts Commission and the Knoxville Arts Council.

Zimmermann believes too many artists have isolated themselves from society
and are content with criticizing from a distance the poor taste prevalent in
today’s world.

From such an attitude, no increase in aesthetic sensitivity and certainly no
improvement in taste can occur. An artist must therefore participate in society.

Zimmermann’s purpose with clay is to create in the manufacture of utilitarian
ware an awakening of the aesthetic tendencies latent in everyone. The artist's
responsibility is to help create a new humanism and to return the meaning of art
to. common, everyday life.

Come meet this intriguing individual Friday afternoon at 4 p.m. in the
Union Gallery and see his work which will be on display there. Refreshments
will be provided.

Despite concert appearances as opening acts for Melissa Manchester, B.B.

duo still opt for collegiate audiences.

Together as a team nine years, they met at the University of Wisconsin and —
began a high school lyceuni‘program throughout eight states, doing 350 shows
within six months. :

After a short time on TV with which they were not particularly pleased, their’
career took off when they emceed at a National Entertainment- Conference
convention. Since then they have been averaging about 165 college dates a year.

The comedy of Edmonds and Curley is rooted in improvisation, incorporating
sound effects, pantomime and developing characters,

Says Edmonds, ‘‘Thom is the comedian. I’m more of a comedy actor: We
perform short stories by acting them out with sound effects: We don’t do
political or racial sketches, so everyone understands what we're doing.”’

Edmonds and Curley still do not feel comfortable with club dates and
television appearances. “‘If we could do one week in a club or one college date,.
we'd take the college,’’ says Edmonds.

They will be performing in the 900 Room tomorrow night at 8:30 and 10:30. _
Admission is $1.00. yt Ca
