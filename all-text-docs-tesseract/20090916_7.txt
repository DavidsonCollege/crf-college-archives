DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER —

Well the fun’ s over and he’s gone to church

Kanye West, American Hero,

New York, New York—On
Sunday night America witnessed
a heroic act from rapper and en-
tertainer Kanye West. At the MTV
Video Music Awards, Kanye West
bravely removed a microphone,
which he believed to be infected
with swine flu and anthrax, from
teen music sensation Taylor Swift.

Mr. West heroically endangers his own well-being and
sucessful career to keep the younger generation safe.

West had been backstage when
the Best Female Video winner was
announced. West, with his keen
skills of observation (generally
directed towards fashion), saw a
disgruntled and conniving Lady
Gaga smear something from her/
his infamous bulge on the micro-
phone before it was handed back
to the master of ceremonies. When
Swift accepted the microphone
along with her award, West brave-
ly intervened.

“I knew something bad was
going to happen if she accepted
that award,” West explained on his
blog. “It’s like how I rap: I don’t
think, it just happens. If anyone
else was as rich or as perfect as
me, they would have done the
same thing,” he added.

West did not want to create a
state of panic because of the po-
tentially infected microphone and

dexterously thought up a reason
why he took the microphone.

“I’m one of the best freestylers
ever! I just screamed something
about Beyonce. It didn’t even
make sense. The crowd loved it.”
West asserted that Ms. Beyonce
Knowles had created one of the
greatest music videos of all time.
In an off-the-record interview,

Ms. Knowles

confessed that
she was “pretty
turned on by
how unapolo-
getically rude
[West] was on
my behalf.”

Cameras
didn’t show
Kanye quickly
cleaning the
microphone
with anti-bac-
terial disinfec-
tant before he
handing it back
to Swift. West
notified the
event’s security
shortly there-
after. Security
escorted West
out, to avoid
any further in-
cidents with the
mischievous
Lady Gaga.
NYPD of-
ficers were on
hand to collect
evidence and
build the best

possible case

against Lady Gaga in court. After
the event concluded, Gaga was
taken into custody.

“If anyone else was as
rich or as perfect as
me, they would have

done the same thing.”

New York Governor David
Patterson said “we owe this man
an incredible debt. What he did
was heroic and selfless.”

The media frenzy over the epi-
sode has done Kanye West well.
His own plans of renaming every
Monday “Kanyeday,” are more
likely to succeed. West has also
received invitations to dozens of
unrelated awards ceremonies.

“T’ll be hosting the Pulitzer
Price shit this year. Whatever.”

Student Prevents Popularity
Saves Teen Superstar’s Life /with Terrible First Impression

Freshman Evan Estrada unwit-
tingly committed social suicide
on Monday afternoon. A panel of
experts is convinced that an error
as great as his is already working
against him to prevent any valu-
able friendships here at Davidson.

“TI was excited to go down for
burgers and dogs at Warner,” said
Estrada. “A couple guys from the
hall came with me and we started
talking to some of the freshmen
girls. That’s when it happened.”

Estrada made a casual refer-
ence to a Hootie and the Blowfish
song as an ice-breaker and it blew
up in his face.

“T don’t actually like the
band!” he exclaimed. “It was a
joke. My dad owns a record store.
1’m not some kind of dumbass!”

Estrada, an athletic and socia-
ble young man from Gainesville,
FL, normally enjoys meeting peo-
ple. Estrada was vice president
of the student body at his high
school and helped start a non-

Description: English majors
are people who take pleasure in the
art of human expression in written
form. They typically enjoy quoting
verses of poetry to each other and
creating snobby, intellectual jokes

of their studies or the fact that
they are naturally gifted, English
majors often escape into abstract
language when threatened so that
nobody knows what they hell they
are talking about.
