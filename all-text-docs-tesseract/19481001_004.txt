| We are very glad to hear that the

Democrats are to be highly com-
mended for their action which
will go down in American history
as one of the great political poli-
cies.

But we believe that the Republi-
cans agree with many of the state-
ments made by the Democratic
candidates for offices, and we can-
not help but speculate upon what
these statements may be,

We could probably say without
fear of contradiction that Governor
Dewey would support the follow-
ing statements made by Mr. Tru-
dnan:

“The West has a vital interest in
this election.” Oakland, Sept. 22.
(We're glad to hear they are back
in the Union.) ‘

‘“We all know that Communists,
along with others, have tried to
worm their way into the Govern-
ment.” Sept. 28. (Well, you can't
blame the Republicans for trying)

.'T don’t know,” Austin, Sept. 26.
(Subscription rates to the David-
sonian are very reasonable.)
This-is indeed a monumental
year for students of American his-
tory. Not since Cal (“Keep Cool
with Cal”) Coolidge condenced all
the knowledge of economics, so
ciology, and politics in that state-
ment, “Unemployment results when
a large number of people are out
