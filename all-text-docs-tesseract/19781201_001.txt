Student Auditions Held

'WDAV to end-

its long hiatus

By CHARLES ERWIN
News Editor
College Radio Station WDAV is scheduled to sign back on the air
Friday at 7 a.m. — ending its seven week broadcasting hiatus.
The station, which has for months been a source of acrimony,
rancor, and controversy on campus, will play little but classical
music for the next few weeks, according to communications

Director Martha Roberts.

On Tuesday night, Roberts
told a group of 20 students that

it is ‘‘conceivable,’’ although.

‘‘unlikely,”’ that WDAV will
remain a totally-classical sta-
tion in the future. |

Whether it does or not will
depend largely on the person
who is hired to be “Director of
Radio,” the major new admini-

proved by the college’s Board of

-She said the director will be
“the ultimate authority, the
main figure” over WDAV.

“From what I understand he
doesn’t want this job,”* they
said. Lovell will continue doing
much of the work he has done in
thepast. _ _

Roberts revealed that several
people have already been inter-
viewed for the director of radio’s
position, but said none of them
have possessed all of the “three
talents” that the administration

wants in the person it hires.
She said the n is
