By MARSHALL FEASTER

As an athletic photographer

I feel that I occupy a some
what unique position with
wegards to Davidson foot
ball; I am neither a real
outsider nor a,real part of
the team, This neither-no:
situation has, however, pro
vided me with some ‘obser
vations whic unknown
by students quite often
unnoticed by the team
In order to subst it

this point I will cite a fev
examples. It has, been said

God knows how many times
that, football is a game of

inches. In some,respects, at

least, the old cliche couldn't

be more wrong.

Take a guess, for instance,
at how much tape is used
every season to tape player's
ankles. Would you _ believe
about 200,000 yards? That's
close to 138 miles.

“The amount of ‘Take
Five’’, or green stuff as the
players call.it, that is drunk
is just as amazing. The
team manages to somehow
consume 1800 gallons cooled
by 9,000 pounds of ice every
year. This figure is even
more unbelievable if you
have ever tasted the stuff.

Somewhere around forty
man hours of work are re-
quired to keep those helmets
a shiney silver. (They have
to be painted twice . before
every game). This year's
model has the added attrac
tion of the football centenial
sticker. The stickers have
given Hogbody Hale an op
portunity to at least become
an All-American at “some
thing. Ain't nobody who can
stick those stickers like Hog.

Something else that may
not be known by the average
Davidson fan is the amount
of contrast present among
those associated with the
team. Gary Hemric, the play-
er turned coach. exemplifies
this. When Hemric was a
player, he was notorious for
his lack of speed. Now, I un-
derstand, he pounds its im
portance into the freshmen
players’ heads (as well as
into their bodies) every day.
It’s funny how a change in
position. can bring with it
a change in the threshold of
pain.

This contrast on the team,
however, is best brought out
by observation of the full-
time coaching staff. Can you
imagine standing at a prac-
tice session and hearing
Coach Fagg speaking of the
line while Coach Smith calls
the,.same thing a point of
reference?

At least in some cases, how-
ever, lack of contrast has

is when the team is at Camp
Carolina for pre-season prac
ti¢e. It's bad there all the
time, and one of the worst
things is the weather, (Even
Coach Smith can’t seem to
change it). Probably the
worst single factor there is
the fog.

When Jimmy Poole played
for the Cats, the team never
practiced the long passing
attack there in the morning.
Jimmy's bombs were the
run-under-me-catch-me_ type,
and they tended@to get lost
in the early morning clouds.

The fog does have its ad
vantages, though. Sometimes
during sprints I could see
guys slip over to the side
of the field and hide under
the fog’s happiness blanket.
Coach Todd was really pleas
ed to see how hard the boys
could run that last wind
sprint till he discovered what
was happening.

Aside from not knowing
about all this, the fan often
does not realize just how
lucky he is to be able to
see a football game at all.

Various examples come to
mind.
In Coach Smith's first

game as head coach here the
team traveled to Greenville
to play Furman, hit the field,
and then realized that the
footballs were back at Lefty’s
(Johnston Gym if you will).

Two years ago D.C. almost
did not make it to West
Virginia (maybe we shouldn't
have anyway), because the
pilot of the plane seemed
to forget where the runway
was.

That same year we did
have one good experience on
the plane — the name of
the stewardess on the flight
to Charleston and The Cita-
del was Miss Sexton. When
she introduced herself on the
plane's p.a. I somehow can't
remember hearing the last
three letters of her name.
That's the only laugh we got
that weekend.

But somehow the team al-
ways seems to make it for
the game, and this season
we even win.

of Gordon Slade.

Pikas, Sig Eps, Phi Delts
Unbeaten In

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

Through Wednesday's
games three teams, the Phi
Delts, Pikas, and Sig Eps,
remained undefeated in
IMAC flickerball action.

The Delts won two very
important games in the past
week, as they knocked off
the previously unbeaten KA’'s
and Betas to bring their re
cord to 3-0.

The victory over the KA’s,
33-31, was probably the most
exciting game of the season,
as the Delts came from two
touchdowns behind in the
last three minutes. Romey
Fisher threw five touchdown
passes for the KA’s, but to
no avail, as a ‘Delt intercep
tion brought about the win
ning score.

On Wednesday “the Delts

men. Only four players start-

with less than seven

ed.the game, as most of the
Beta team decided not to
play because of the Morator-
ium. Jeff Chetwood and Jack
Steele played outstanding

games for the Delts.

The Pikas beat the Gamms,
20-13, and the ATO’s, 33-25,
to match the Delts’*3-0 re
cord. Mark Affeldt scored the
winning touchdown against
the Gamms, and George
Graff scored three times as
the Pikas hit their season
high point total against the
winless Taus,

The SPE’s also brought
their record to 3-0, with vic
tories over the Sigma Chis,

25-6, and the Phi Gamms,
33-13. In the Machi victory
Buzz Tarver’s passing and

running were the difference,
as he scored two touchdowns.
Dave Shepler
Folger were outstanding on
defense.

In a Monday game, the
KA’s defeated the Indepen-
dents, 37-7, to bring their
record to 3-1. Romey Fisher
threw five touchdown passes,
with Steve Williams catching
two of those.

Before their loss to the
KA's, the Indies won their
first game of the season, 27-
18, from the ATO's. Coach
Bill Funderburk called the
game ‘‘a great team effort.”
Bill Shutt caught two touch-
down passes and threw one,
but the key play of the game
was an interception by Dan
Graham which went for a
touchdown.

In a Wednesday game the
Sigma Nus tripped the Sigma
Chris, 26-18, for their first
victory. The. Machis suffer-
ed their third straight defeat.

IMAC Play

Clark Nickerson threw three
toucltdown passes, two to
John Heitmann and one to
Tom Wheatley. Steve Hayes
threw to Rick BuSh for the
fourth score, Coach ‘Nicker
son felt that his team played
good defense, but frankly at-
tributed the win to the ab
sence of several Machi start-
ers.

In other games the Betas
beat the SAE’s, 40-20, as tail
back Ken Crews starred, and
the Pi Kapps forfeited to the
SAE’s and were massacred
by the Kappa Sigs, 58-0.

just too good for us to stop

While Slade was riddling
the pass defense of the Spid-
ers, the lightly regarded de
fense of the Wildcats bottled
up the potent Richmond of-
fense. :

The victory for the Wild-
cats gave them the inside
traek for the conference title,
but the schedule is rugged.
Davidson plays the. other
three top contenders, East
Carolina, The Citadel and
William and Mary, away
from the friendly confines
of Richardson Field. All
three games are scheduled
as homecomings for the other
schools.

In addition, for the first
time*in many a moon it will
be the other teams who are
taking shots at Davidson and
not the ‘Cats who are sniping

away at favorites.

But Homer Smith isn’t
complaining at. all about
that.
