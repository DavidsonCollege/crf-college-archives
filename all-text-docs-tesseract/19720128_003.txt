SOS: Security Offensive Suggested

By STEVE LeRESCHE
Staff Writer

“They knew what they were
after. They broke in the window
nearest it. Phere must have
been two of them because it was
so heavy. They carried it up the
steps and right out the front
door.”

That is how Brian Tarr, pres-
ident of the ATO house, describ-
ed the theft of that house's tele-
vision set over Christmas vaca-
tion. Despite the fact that the
number of reported thefts on
campus is just about the same
as last year, there is a growing
concern about campus security
at) Davidson.

Part of this concern stems
from the fact that security is
an important factor to be. con-
sidered when thinking of coed-
ucation. The recent attack of
one coed has already had _ its
impact. Bobbie Blackwood, an
exchange student from Hollins,
freely admits that she advises
prospective exchange students
to forget about Davidson unless
something is donc about secur-
itv on Campus.

Many male students forget the *

increased secu ity necessary
when a large number of girls
become Davidson students and
therefore are not always escort-
cd when on the campus.

Another factor adding to the
seriousness of the problem is
the growth of Charlotte as a
metropolitan area. It has been
predicted that Charlotte will ex-
pand rapidly to the north as 1-77
is opened.

Consequently, there will be
many more people in the Da
vidson area than at present,
many of them different) from
the populace in the area in the
past. With the “open” nature of
the Davidson campus this means
increased security problems.

A third factor to be consider
ed is the general lack of securi
ty on the campus in the past
The college and the students

have cue to ex:ect a non-acti-
vist roc by security officers, a
policy which has been possible
in the past. but may not be to-

day.

All these factors must be con-
sidered in the planning of a se-
curity program now. The admin-
istration is well aware of this.

C. David Cornell, Vice Presi-
dent for Finance and Develop-
ment, says that ‘Upgrading the
security system is a high prior-
ity. This year’s budget includes
a request for a significant in-
crease in funds for security.”

Cornell, Dean of Students Will
Terry, and Director of the Phys-
ical Plant Grover Meetze have
all voiced the opinion that se-
curity should be upgraded. The
question seems to be: What
should be done first?

All three men agree that there
is a need for better lighting on
campus. Meetze drew up a gen-
eral lighting plan for the col-
lege in 1964. Ever since then he
has put in a ‘‘standard request”
every year for funds for this
purpose. The request has yet to
be heeded and lighting has not
been improved.

There is also a need for an
increase in personnel. At the
piesent there is only one secur-
i.y officer on duty each eight

AN ANALYSIS
By ROBERT TOUCHTON

Associate Editor

The security of any sucieiy is
the responsibility of the mem-
bers of that system, and _ suc-
cessful security must come, in
the final analysis, from the
people within that society.

The members of Davidson‘s
society — the students them-
selves — must take premiere
responsibility for the security
of their campus.

Perhaps the major problem
in the realm of improved se-
curity lies in the lack of experi-
ence the college has had in
dealing with thievery, assault,
and other crimes aga‘nst prop-

erty and persons.

Davidson has been an isolat-

hour shift. Security officers are
trying to make the best of this
shortage by increasing their co-
operation with the Davidson po-
lice.

Linked with the problem of
personnel is one of attitude on
the part of students. Meetze
points out’ that the security of-
ficer is not employed to spy on
the students, but rather to help
them.

Terry spoke of these two
areas by saying, “‘A security
force must have sophistication
in dealing with students and
outsiders. You don‘t deal with
them the same way. We need a
good man at the head of secur-
ity who has the ability to train
others. He also must maintain
a nitty-gritty relationship with
students.”

Terry went on to say, “It
would be very unfortunate to
have a ‘closed campus’. But it
could come to that. The security
force needs the cooperation of
staff and students in reporting
outsiders on campus and in tak-
ing minimal security precau-
tions with their own _ belong-
ings.”

ed rural men’s college with a
strong honor code and an ad-
ministration which has made
security personnel into watch-
dogs rather than crimefighters
or law enforcers.

Other colleges have for years
had locked dorm rooms, armed
security men patrolling dorms,
and bright lighting that makes
the campus look like Washing-
ton, D. C. at night.

But Davidson hasn't. And
perhaps everyone—students as
well as administration — has
become so accustomed to
things in the ‘‘good ol’ days”
that they malfunction when
faced with the real world of
student thieves, men intent on
forceable assault, and a so-
ciety which tries to get all it
can by any possible means.

When Director of Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze. Jr. at-
tempted to install additional
lighting in 1964, students (sup-
ported by some faculty) pulled
up stakes and physically pre-
vented the erection of the poles
for the new lights.

And students are so used to,
and fond of, their ‘‘open dorms”
that they refuse to recognize
that there are ‘‘no trespassing”
signs on doors to all dorms and
that these apply to everyone
but invited guests and other au-
thorized persons.

The administration has plans
to “beef up” its security sys-
tem, maintaining as far as pos-
sible the privacy of students in
their actions and the tradition-
al non-interference of security
personnel in student life.

The college might be wise to
establish closer relationships
with the Town of Davidson po-
lice. Local police prevented
three thefts at fraternity houses
over the Christmas break, and
their cooperation in guarding
the campus, particularly over
vacations, can surely be gar-
nered without sacrificing the
impunity from arrest which

Student Involvement: Essential Answer

But the real answer to the
security problem lies in stu-
dent willingness to help the
college in protecting property
and person. Strange persons
roaming the halls of dormi-
tories can, and should, be
questioned as to their desti-
nation and invitation.

Perhaps students could be
hired—or maybe even volun-
teer—to aid the security force
in protecting the campus. Ar

There are certain solutions
that only the college can effect.
But if past experience holds
true, and if a real and lasting
answer to the dilemma is to be
found, students must become
concerned about the situation
and actively support the solu-
tion. The security of their cam-
pus depends, at last, on them.

Confront Similar Problems

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

Other colleges in Mecklenburg
County apparently had security
problems similar ‘to the situa-
tion at Davidson, but many in-
creased their security force to
handle the difficulties.

James Dennis Rash, Dean of
Students at the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte,
pointed out that his campus is
more spread out than Davidson
and that the students are forced
to commute in greater num-
bers.

‘‘About 7a per cent of our stu-
dents do not. live in college res-
idence halls, so we have people
coming and going all the time.
Also, we hold classes in some
of the dormitories, so there are
many people in the dorms be-
sides residents.”

He stated that they have not
been troubled by attempts to
detain coeds, although he ac-
knowledged that it is harder to
know about this situation when
large numbers of students are
living off campus.

‘We have a new chief secur-
ity officer who has tightened
things up. We have recylindered
all the locks and we have tried
to limit the number of master
keys that are distributed.”

At Johnson C. Smith Univer-
sity in Charlotte, Dean of Stu-
dents Joseph Gaston said that
the University has had some
security problems, but he was
not sure that it was an increase
over previous years.

‘Many of our students make
frequent trips to the conven-
ience stores in the Five Points

.community, and some of our

men students have been intimi-
dated by non-students in the
neighborhood. We’ve also had
some petty thievery in the dor-
mitory, but no incidents of large
items such as televisions or ex-
pensive clothing.”

Gaston said that students are
encouraged to lock their rooms.
He said that the majority of
students are careful about this,
but some leave keys on the
door sill and with friends.

‘‘We have a security force of
four persons at a given time,
with more at night and for big
occasions when the campus is
crowded,” Gaston explained.

Miss Diane DelPizzo, Dean of
Students at Queens College, re.
ports that incidents of petty
theft or attempted assault have
not been a problem at the
Charlotte campus.
