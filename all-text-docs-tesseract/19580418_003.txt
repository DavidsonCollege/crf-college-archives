Now that the Walker regime has moved in to take
over this newspaper and consequently our friend, George
Ramsey; has moved up the ladder of success to associate
editor, the editorship of this page has been turned over
to yours truly. But before you go, George, your readers
and I just want to say that we’ll sure miss you and all
those letters home to your folks.

This column will continue last years policy of
giving the side lights on sports around the campus.
Also this year we want this space to be a sounding
board for student opinion on the athletic life of the
college. §f you have any legitimate, printable gripes
about anything in the way of sports just send it
in and we'll include it, with your name, in this
column.

Memos From Spring Tennis Trip

Members of the tennis team returned from Florida
sufficiently impressed with their little mentor, Dick Mc-
Kee. McKee, hearing that Bill Talbert, former Davis
Cup captain and four times national doubles champ, was
playing at the exclusive Ponte Vedra Racquet Club,

promptly piled his boys into the cars and set off for}|COURT CAPTAIN

Ponte Vedra.

Upon arrival he walked up and slapped his old
friend, Billy, on the back, introduced him to the awed
members of his squad, and then led his dirty tee shirt and
tennis short clad warriors through the rows of million-
aires ready to watch the match to choice seats on the
spectator lawn. '

Talbert, in a brief speech before the match, com-
mented that the reason Australia is dominating the
tennis world today is because of the nation wide in-
terest in the sport. In Sidney, Australia alone there
are eleven thousand lighted courts, more than al!
the lighted courts in the United States.

Odds And Ends

Congratulations to Semi Mintz on being the nation’s
free-throw leader.

Sports spectacle of the month is George Hart’s
towering home run against William and Mary that easily
cleared the first row of trees behind the right field fence
and is believed to have joined the Explorer in orbit.

Brightest new spot on the tennis court is Greens-
boro’s Doug ©... The lean freshman, nicknamed
“The Greyhound” by Coach McKee, is beginning
to put fear in the hearts of the upperclassmen in
the upper regions of the varsity tennis ladder.

A welcomed improvement on campus is Coach Whit-
tle’s renovated track, complete with cement installments
for the discus, shot put, broad jump, high jump, and
pole vault. However, plagued: by a flood of injuries, Whit-
tle is having trouble finding men to use them. Ailing with
varying amount of severity, are Frank Cenegy, Angus
McBride, Graham George, John Huie, Marvin Bently,
and Al McKay.

The other spring sport, golf, also has a promising
future with freshman Verner Stanley shaping into one
of the finest golfers to represent Davidson in years.

The Lizard Leads
Lethal Net Squad

Leading the Cat netters into the fray this season
is their amiable captain, Tom McCutchen. Boasting a

good forehand and a slashing net game, Fom has been
a mainstay in the Wildcat attack so far this year.

Tom, a memoper of Kappa Sig-
ma social fraternity hails from
Plorence, S. C., where he has
won the town championship for
the last two years in a row. Be-
fore graduation from Florence
Righ, he led the local nettefs
at the number one slot.

Currently Tom is _ holding
down fourth position for the
Cats, although he has played as
high as nuniber two. His sea-
son record of seven. wins and
only one loss, a close three set-
match against Toledo, is one
of the best on the squad.

Davidson currently holds

Scott is optimistic about his
squad’s chances against State,
and commented that it should
be an easy win.

In a 16%-10% loss to Caro-
lina last Monday, Verner Stan-
ley was Davidson's top man,
carding a two under par 70
which was just nipped by a fine
69 scored by U. N. C. medalist
Bill Thornton. Matches with
Duke yesterday and a return
tilt with the Tarheels today
made up a full week.

CONFERENCE CHAMPS?

Scott stated that his men, who
have done well against rough
ACC rivals, were a good bet to
take the Southern Conference
championship.

Davidson will face Wake
Forest in a return engagement
at Winston-Salem on Monday.

Look To W&L Meet

By BILL HELLIER
Unable to rid themselves of the wet weather that

streak and Coach Dick Me-
Kee doesn’t think they will
have much trouble. “We
may win one or two matches
at the most,” he = said.
“Their top three men are
almost unbeatable.”

McKee added, however, that
this contest was just what his
team needed, and that it would
provide much needed experi-
ence. “We're just coming into
the part of our schedule where
the boys have something to work
for. We’ve had a pretty easy |
time with teams like Wofford
and Furman, and we need some
hard matches.”

He went on to predict a
“hard match" against Duke here
this afternoon. The ‘Cats have
not. beaten Duke in five years.

Davidson enters its weekend
activity riding a very creditable
7-1 record. They have lost only
to the Jacksonville Naval Air
Station, a team composed of
former college players. Al-
though lacking a ‘“sure-win”
big man in the initial slot, the
‘Cats accord their success to
good over-all power and depth.

The probable line-up against
Miami in the singles will be
as follows: No. 1—Dave Pear-
sall, No. 2—Semi Mintz, No. 3—
John Poindexter, No. .4—Tom

The Purple Hurricane from
Greenville edged out the Wild-
cats 6612-63% by winning the
final relay. Only two points
separated the teams up to the
last event in a nip and tuck
battle which saw the Wildcats
dominating the field events
and Furman taking the edge on
the track.

FIELD EVENTS

Dale Gramley, Stuart Nickles
and Dave Warden took top
honors on the field, each tak-
ing one first place. Warden's
toss of 42 ft. earned a tie for! , wer, ;

‘Cats were led by Jim Bownes,

er. Murray and .Bremer won| §
firsts in the broad jump and
high hurdles, and Bownes tied
with Bremer for first in the

In the two mile race, Ray
Antley paced the field with a
winning time of 10:36.4 and was
closely followed by Angus Mc-
Bride in second place. Brownic
Thurman covered the single lap
of the 440 -in :54.2 seconds| ‘
which was good for a first.

In contrast to the poor weath-
er of the Furman meet, Satur:
day afternoon produced some
rare sunshine for a triangular
contest between Davidson, N. C.
State and Clemson.

TALENTED TIGERS

Both depth and talent were
at the disposal of the Ctemson
Tigers who literally walked off
with the win. Davidson edged
State for second place mainly
on the strength of weight man!

In two other matches this
week Davidson defeated
Wofford yesterday and
soundly walloped South
Carotina 9-0 on Wednesday
without the loss of a set.
