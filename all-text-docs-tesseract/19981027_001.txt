Prominent feminist delivers 1998

Politics of Sexuality’ |

On Thursday, Oct. 22, Gloria Steinem, the
1998 Reynolds’ Lecturer, spoke to a sold-out
audience at Love Auditorium. Her lecture ad-
dressed “The Politics of Sexuality.” :

Steinem began by informally asking the au-
dience, “Are we going to:have a good time or
what?” She admitted to be nervous to follow in the

human. The difference between two men or two
women may be more than the difference between
men and women as groups.”

At the conclusion of her speech, Steinem
encouraged the audience to “behave if everything
we do matters.” Building upon the saying that one
flap of a butterfly’s wing can affect the weather
upstream, Steinem said, “Each of us has an incred-
ible amount of power and all together, we make
one hell of a butterfly.”

footsteps of such distinguished past
Reynolds’ Lecturers as Eleanor
Roosevelt, Maya Angelou, and Jane
Goodall. In lieu of the celebration of
coeducation at Davidson, Steinem men-
tioned that the presence of women at
Davidson happened to coincide with
the beginning of the modern women’s
movement.

Steinem talked about the general
population’ s trouble with the word femi-
nism, saying that “at the same time, we
do and don’t know what it means.” She
cited the definition of feminism from a
dictionary: “The belief in the full social,
political and economic equality of men
and women.” Steinem explained femi-
nism as a term whose principles. many
might agree with, but still have trouble
identifying with, due to society’s pre-
conceptions of what feminism is. The
women’s movement, she feels, has made
progress but still has very far to go as
she said, “Any social justice movement
must have at least 100 years to make a
real mark.” e

tion-and-answer period and
then a reception in the 900
Room. A poignant moment
was reached when Susan
Greene, the first woman to
run for Congress in North
Carolina, said, “Thank you
for what you have given my
life, my sisters’ lives, and
our children’s lives.”
Steinem is a writer,
editor, lecturer, social ac-
tivist, and world rénowned
leader of the modern femi-
nist movement. She serves
as a writer and consulting
editor for Ms. Magazine,

which she co-founded in _

1972, after she helped to
start New York magazine in
1968. She has also written
several books and has co-
produced an Emmy award-
winning TV documentary
and a made-for-TV movie.
The Women’s Action Alli-

Steinem referred to her topic of

ance, the National Women’s

“The Politics of Sexuality” as a particu-
lar part of where we are in this stage of
the women’s revolution. In reference to the Clinton-
Lewinsky scandal, she explained her indifference
to the case on the basis that the sexual relations
were based on free will rather than harassment.
Politics are found in sexuality in our culture, she
said, by the fact that we often define sex for women
“to be okay and moral only if it takes place within
the bounds of patriarchal marriage.”

“Our need to maintain a racist caste system in
society,” Steinem said, “is dependent on control-
ling women’s for reproduction.” Steinem contin-
ued, “It hasn’t always been this way with sexual-
ity” and mentioned ancient cultures who could
separate sexuality and reproduction and didn’t
“demonize sexuality, but even honored homo-
sexuals and bisexuals as having double the knowI-
edge.” Because “our culture is beginning to see
sexuality as moral as long as no force is involved,”
Steinem said, “it’s obviously not just for reproduc-

tion but is also a way we communicate, a form of

expression, love, spirituality, and pleasure .”, With
humor, she added that her talk was appropriately
being given “in an auditorium called Love.” If we
don’t separate sexuality from reproduction,
Steinem believes, “it’s like saying you have free-
dom of speech but only if you.say one thing.”
Steinem explained that the patriarchal struc-
ture has gotten men hooked on the idea that they
need to have dominance over others in their lives.
Stressing the importance of individualism over
grouping by gender, Steinem stated, ‘We are all

Political Caucus, and the
Coalition of Labor Union Women were all founded
in part by Steinem’s efforts. She is president of
both Voters for Choice, a bipartisan committee for
reproductive freedom, and the Ms. Foundation for
Women, a national multiracial women’s fund.
Currently, she serves as one of ten International
Working Group members of “Beyond Racism,”
an initiative that includes a two-year study of
comparative racial relations in the United States,
Brazil, and South Africa. Listed in The World
Almanac’s 25 Most Influential Women in America,
Steinem was inducted into the Women’s Hall of
Fame in. 1993.

standing up at Davidson
College to talk about sex.”
