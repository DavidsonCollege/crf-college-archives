President’s Statement

The fact that the present Union is substandard and in-
adequate is apparent to us all.
willing to sacrifice it now for something better in the future.

... Obviously we cannot have a permanent new Union before

To make an intelligent decision on a temporary
location for the immediate future, we must have before
us all the facts about all the practical alternatives. The
Union Board is now working on a report which will present
these facts. When the repor? is in, which should be in the
very near future, it will be published so that any and all
who want to comment on it may do so.

As to the long-range future, we must and will have a
Union Bullding far superior to the present one. An identi-
flable physical location for the Union ts a key factor, es-
pecially on a campus like ours.

A new Union could be created by constructing an en-
tirely new bullding or by remodeling an existing one. Space,
cost, and functional factors should be compared before a
! am asking the Budget,
and Grounds Committee, working with the Bulidings and
Grounds Committee of the Trustees, to begin work on this
as @¢arly as possible after Christmas.

RHC Reallocates Money

By THOM NICHOLL

Completely reversing its po-
licy adopted only in the previ-
ous meeting, the RHC met Tues-
day and voted 7-0-1 to re-allo-
cate to each freshman dorm
$150 for social expenses as or-
iginally provided in the RHA
budget.

About 25 freshmen attended
the meeting to protest the RHC’s
policy decision not to provide
funds for social functions of any
particular dorm, but only for
parties open to the entire cam-
pus.

The incident was touched off
by a group from Watts Dorm
who planned a party and re-
quested RHA money to fund the
event.

Dean Disposes Of First Case

By BOB HOWELL
Staff Writer

The new Governance Regula-
tions, enacted this year met
with their first test this past
week with disposition of a case
involving the violation of a fire-
works fegulation, according to
Will Terry. dean of students.

Terry said that he was work-
ing in his office Tuesday night.

December 7, when he was dis
turbed by the sound of explod
ing firecrackers. He said he
walked outside and = observed
the ensuing ‘‘war'’ between
Cannon and Watts Dormitories.

By noting which window the
fireworks were coming from, it
was easily determined which
room the students were in, so
Terry went up to the fourth
floor of Watts and apprehend

Applications Down
Twenty Per Cent

By MICHAEL TANNER
Staff Writer
Davidson, as many small
private colleges across the
country, is being faced with the
unpleasant prospect of a dwin-

dling market for future stu-
dents.
This was evident last year

when the Admissions staff sud-
dently realized that the niamber
of applications for this year’s
freshman class was down 20
per cent from the previous year.
And unfortunately, the decline
shows signs of repeating itself,
as applications are currently be
low last year’s level.

Norman R. Broadbent, Assist-
ant Director of Admissions, felt
that one of the principal rea-
sons for students choosing large
universities, particularly state
universities, over a school such
as Davidson, is financial. He ex-
plained that as money becomes
tighter, students will be forced
to compromise the advantages
of a small school.

Broadbent also added that
large umiversities, in recent
years, have modified their cur-
riculums to the point where
they can now offer the liberal
arts education, whereas befere.
the small college like Davidson
was king in this area.

The Admissions people are
coming to rely more and more
upon the present student body,
which is thought to be a pri-
mary source of recruitment en-
ergy, to arouse interest in the
home community. The Thanks-
giving ‘“‘Gift Pac” operation
was one of the first examples
of the new drive this year and
will be followed by a similar
pitch at Christmas time.

The Admissions Office is also
attempting to reach more pers-

pective students through high
school guidance offices in parts
of the country (most especially
the metropolitan areas) previ-
ously uncultivated by Davidson.
Among these are Cincinnati,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chi-
cago, Washington, D. C. and
Wilmington, Delaware.

ed the four students who seem-
ed to be involved in the caper.

At the subsequent administra-
tive conference it was brought
out that two of the bovs had
been merely on-lookers, and
they were giving warnings as
to the college's policy on fire-
works. The other two continued
in the conference with the Dean.

While Terry refused to- re-
lease any names, the residents
of Watts Hall were not quite
as hesitant, and one of the
four was located. “I think it was
handled pretty well,’ he said.
“He (Terry) gave us the choice
of wheather we wanted him to
handle it or have it brought be
fore the Student Hearing Com.
mittee, and we choose him.”

The students both admitted to
the charges and were fined $15
euch, to be payed to the Busi-
ness Office by Friday the 17th.
They also refused the option to
oppeal the case, another pro-
vision of the Governance Re.
gulations.

N.C. Fellows Selects 15

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

Fifteen Davidson freshmen re-

ceived notice Dec. 6 of their
acceptance into the N.C. Fel-
lows Program, after a week
end of final selection.

Thirty semi-finalists partici
pated in the final selection here
on campus, Dec. 3 - 5. The Fel-
lows had planned to have the
selection at Montreat, N. C., but
were snowbound on campus.

In spite of the snow, John D.
Kelton, advisor of the program,
felt that the weekend was suc-
cessful. I feel that it went fair-
ly well, considering,”’ Kelton
said, ‘‘We had to start a little
bit late and, as a result, the
interviews were not as inten
sive as we had planned."

After all the activities had
been completed, Kelton chose
the final 15 students on the
basis of the ratings he received
from the interviews and the
small group exercises in which
each individual participated.

The following 15 students
were selected as N.C. Fel-
lows: Lloyd A. Bell III, Blain
Butner, Steve D. Canterbury

Rowan D. Crews, Jr. Rich-
ard B. Damewood, Reginald M.

money would be available and
told the freshmen to proceed
with their plans.

However, instead of providing
the funds, the RHC changed its
policy, declaring that RHA mon-
ey would not e used to finance
restricted parties.

The fickleness of the RHC
may be partially explained by
the confused calendars on which
it conducts its business. The
president is elected in January,
the budget planned in the spring,
and new members selected in
the fall. Thus, last year’s RHC,
under Alexander, appropriated
the freshman funds. That bud-
get was approved by the Cam-
pus Tax Committee. However,
the newly-elected RHC, who
must approve all expenditures,
disagreed with the allocations,
and changed the subdivisions
and terms of the RHA budget.

Concerning the validity of the
change, Alexander stated, ‘‘I do
not think that the Tax Com-
mittee needs to reapprove the
budget. The RHC has the right
to change the sub-divisions with-
in its budget.

But before the meeting, Alex-
ander said, “I think that fresh-
men do not feel part of the
campus. Their social life is lack-

ing because the social system is
not working. The RHC should
use its funds to stimulate dorm
social life, especially next year
with the loss of the union.”

Alexander stated that the
RHC’s opposition to last year’s
budget was two-fold. *‘The mem-
bers felt that everyone should
pay his own social expenses,
except for the regular social
board, and that such a plan
would be an affront to the new
social system by encouraging
freshmen to stay within their
dorms.”

Freshmen David Foerster pro-
tested the loss of the funds,
‘‘We are in our formative years
and we are getting really shaft-
ed. We are not receiving a
complete education. Many fresh-
men are leaving because they
have no social vent.”

After hearing the arguments
and pleas of the freshmen and
some of their counselors, the
RHC was swayed to change its
position. Grange Roller present-
ed the motion to re-allocate the
freshman funds, stating, ‘‘The
amount of money may be trivial,
but at least it will be a token

of our interest and concern.
Clearly, something has to be
done.”’
