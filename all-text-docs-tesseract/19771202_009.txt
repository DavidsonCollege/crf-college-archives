Doctors Barbara Ballard
and John Wheeler have joined
the Davidson staff this fall as
psychological counselors, re-
placing Doctors Dockery,
Hall and Workman. A Hus-
band-wife team who have a
private practice in Charlotte,
they are available for student
counseling: from 10 to 6,

Tuesday through Friday.

Dr. Ballard is at Davidson
Tuesday and Thursdays. She
emphasizes the availability of
the counselors for students
who have problems with de-
pression or academic deci-
sions; for those students with
social problems, whether in
relations with family, room-
mates, boyfriends, or girl-
friends: and for students who
‘are under excessive stress,
anxiety, or confusion.

An essential part of her
work with students lies in
relaxation training. Similar in
purpose to meditation, it a-
llows physical relaxation and
attempts to discipline the
mind on one thing. In this way
the student can hopefully re-
cognize and come to grips with
his or her problem.

Although both counselors
agreed that at times psycho-
logical testing is a useful tool,
they rarely use tests with

students. Dr. Wheeler finds
Davidson students sufficiently
articulate and of a certain level
of psychological awareness
that such test are of little use.
Also, most of the counseling is
for a short time only, student
use of the service peaking at
the end of terms and other
periods of stress.

Dr. Wheeler, who is avail-
able Wednesdays and Fridays,
stresses the importance of
confidentiality between coun-
selor and student which is not
always possible with friends or
the people one associates with
daily. He also points to the
advantage of having one male
and one female counselor for
those who would feel more
comfortable talking with a
man ora woman.

Although Dr. Wheeler does
not feel that Davidson has a
higher number of students
needing psychological assis-
tance than other shcools, he
sees academic communities in
general as capable of creating
problems when competition is
solely directed against fellow
students or for grades.

Also Wheeler insists that he
does not attempt to persuade a
person with academic doubts
to stay in school or leave
school, but that he wants to
help the student explore the
alternatives to help him arrive
at the decision most person-
ally beneficial.

As Dr. Wheeler said, ‘‘We
are here to be of assistance,
and hope that the students
feel free to use us.”

Chris Allen proposed that the
Life/Work Planning idea might be
better in a longer and more concentra-,

moved fast in the meetings, spending
ten minutes on something that could
have lasted for hours.” ~

Ancther student found the meet-
ings too concentrated. Cathy Chester
found that the meetings became
competitive within the discussion
groups. ‘‘Everyone was turned so
inward. I wanted us to help each
other.”

Junior Debbie Elliot found that
more time in the term was needed,
suggesting perhaps that the meetings
begin earlier in the term.

The program, said Ernie Church,
‘‘makes people realize their own
abilities. It builds confidence and it
gives direction.”

Another student agreed: ‘It makes
you feel unashamed, it makes you feel
positive about what you want--it’s
self-discovery .

Anne Abernathy concluded:’’we

Life/Work Planning program
analyzes and clarifies goals

By ANN GARNER
Focus Editor
For the Davidson student
who has notyyet defined his
objectives or goals for any
post-graduate experience, in-
decision must surely be ac-
companied with uneasiness as
the day of reckoning fast
approaches. And for those
clad in academic garb, this
uneasiness must turn to horror
and fear after the ecstasy of
graduation has faded. The
question is of central impor-
tance: How can the graduate
translate his experiences at
school to an interesting job or
even lifetime career?
“Life/Work Planning
evolved from a need of stu-
dents who were having diffi-
culty with what they wanted
to do as they began to think
about Experirential Program-
ming and senior placement,;’
said Director of Experiential
Programs and Life/Work
Planning Ken Wood. “In the
Centering-Venturing program
it becomes both an individual
and group process where peo-
ple can analyze their past
experiences, identify specific
abilities, values, and interests,
and rank them according to
the greatest degree of personal
preference.”
Wood continued: ‘By work-
ing from past experiences,

egch nerson can,now question

,

himself as to ‘What do I need
to do now to get me where I
want to go ?’ which is not
necessarily a lifetime career
decision.”

The next step in the Center-
ing-Venturing program is to
put the people in touch with
those people, nowworking,
who have incorporated similar
interests, abilities, and needs
into a career and life work.

“The focus at this point is
upon enthusiasm of those who
often use their imaginations to
create a career that may be a
combination of interests and
to share this enthusiasm with
those people in the program.”

Wood does utilize testing to
provide ‘‘useful clues”’ in com-
paring one’s score to those of
people who are successful in
the particular field of interest.

Wood also mentioned that
the testing was to some extent
expected by those who partici-
pated in the program but he
strongly emphasized a major
danger in analyzing these test
results: ‘‘The testing does not
determine a person’s direction
or vocation. When used pro-
perly it can be helpful as a
reference point self-evaluation
but is not by any means a
determinative."

The Myers-Briggs type
indicator test is also used to
determine the way that one

typically approaches problems
typically approaches
problems; whether an extro-
vert or introvert, a sensing or
intuitive person, a thinking or
feeling person, and a judging
or perceiving person.
In’addition, Wood states
he is ‘‘not the slightest bit dis-
couraged by tight job mar-
kets. There are enough advan-
tages in a Davidson education
if you just take initiative.”’
Wood continued, ‘So many’
times the student who has put
his foot in the door through
internships or vacation experi-
iences will be more highly
considered when job hunting.
To satisfy this need, Wood
offers experiential and extern
programs in many national
and international locations.
Another option is the Career
Service Program where a stu-
dent may drop out of school
for a term or a year, keeping
his status as a student, to
become involved in a career
exploration program or to
serve disadvantaged people.
Wood concluded, ‘To know
and articulate your interests,
abilities, and values--the three
most important factors in a
career choice--is essential in-
formation in creating a strong
position for an internship as
well as in material decisions in
Life/Work planning.’’
