THE DAVIDSONIAN

Crime ‘kings’ one ste

to being dethroned

A string of automobile break-ins have
recently occurred in the campus parking
lots. Campus police immediately began
pouring all their resources into the case,
and within a short period of time, came
up with an artist’s rendition of the crimi-
nals. As it turns out, the artist’s sketch
was nearly identical to file photos of the
crime trio known to most of the world as
“The Three Kings.” Their name is de-
rived, ironically enough, from the Biblical
story of the three kings (found in Mathew
2:7-12). There is one major difference,
however, between the crime trio and the
biblical wise men: the modern Three
Kings sfea/gifts, rather than giving them.
These Three Kings of Orient are wanted in
4 countries in addition to the United
States and it appears that they have struck
again, this time in Satellite Parking.

This crime spree comes only two
months after their latest caper in Japan.
The trio entered through the ceiling of
Tokyo’s National Museum, disarmed the
security system, defeated several samurai
guards (subsequently removing their top
knots), and stole the ancient Cloud-Clus-
ter sword of Sosanoo. According to leg-
end,.Sosanoo first acquired the mythical
sword when he was in banishment and an
eight-headed dragon had eaten up all the
virgins in the land. He then offered the
dragon an intoxicating drink, slew him,
and removed from his tail the magnificent
sword. The Cloud-Cluster sword, later re-
named the Grass-mower by Yamato

of Japanese sovereignty. The Japanese
are offering a generous reward for the
capture of the criminals and safe return of
their sword. This reward could poten-
tially be a tremendous help to the Campus
Police department.

According to sources within the Cam-
pus Police, nsow that the trio has been
spotted in Davidson, it is surely only a
matter of time before they are appre-

hended. In addition to the aforemen-
tioned sword, they are also wanted for the
theft of seven Faberge eggs, the Emerald
Scepter of Arrabar, and several car ste-
reos. One anonymous freshman girl re-
ports she saw the criminals lurking
around behind Akers. “They said they
wanted to go somewhere they could get
good spaghetti and I saw them board a
plane with a green, white, and orange
flag.”

fi lesson in Commons etiquette

’ Aight, y’all know me. It’s “BIG
DAWG,” from the football team. Since
I’m such a big man around campus, the
newspaper wanted me to write about
some issues messing
up our campus.

there? No, not unless someone takes our
table. Which is what happened last week,
and we had to split up to like 3 or 4 differ-
ent tables. It sucked big time.

With all the
sprints we have

Today I will talk -
about a major issue
right now, especially
with all the new
froshies. And that is-
sue I like to call:
‘Commons etiquette.’

First off, the foot-
ball table is for foot-
ball players ONLY. I
may not be the
smartest nerd on
campus, but it’s easy
enough to know
which table is the
football table.

For those of you
who are still clueless
or really dense in the
cerebellum: It’s the
one the football play-
ers ALWAYS sit at by
the right side line
with the chefs table.
Next to the baseball table. Duh. Last
Sunday brunch, there was.a whole hall full
of froshies sitting there.

I mean, do I ever try to sit over at any of
the other tables at any point during the
year, even if my non-football friends are

practices, you’d
think people
would respect

walk the least

sible when

We literally
tear up the
fields we prac-
tice on, and
have to move to
different ones
because we
make them
into big sand

practice on.
That’s a
hardcore work-
out. And to do
those hardcore workouts we need to be
well energized and well hydrated.
Which brings me to my second point:

all the Powerade. Especially the blue

Powerade on the Chef's table side.
There’s nothing that pisses me off more
than pushing that button and watching
clear Powerade come out. Then you walk
to the FOOTBALL TABLE and on your

way see some skinny punk who you know
has never played a sport other than
foosbali with 3 glasses of blue powerade
getting BBQ sauce for his waffle fries. It
makes me want to knock his tray on the
ground and then do 400 pushups.

You know that athletes need to replen-
ish their energy that we lose everyday in
tough practices.

When non-athletes drink it all what are
supposed to do? Anybody seen “Remem-
ber the Titans?”

Excuse me I need to go get my catcard

excuse to hit on the employees back there.
Be sure to write that tip down.

OOPS

Juggaloz converge
on Davidson

An almost comic mix-up
caused thousands of fans of a
popular musical group to de-
scend on the Davidson College
campus.

Fans of the rap-metal band
the Insane Clown Posse, famous
for their hits such as “Ghetto
Freak Show” shared the belief
that Davidson was hosting a
convention for band devotees,
when in fact it was a festival for
jugglers.

The erroneous notion
stemmed from the strong simi-
larity between the word “jug-
glers” and the pet name for In-
sane Clown Posse followers,
“Juggaloz.” Followers of ICP,
the Detroit based duo of Violent J and
Shaggy 2 Dope, regard themselves as part
of acounter-culture cult and consider the
band to be prophets.

According to Juggalo Mark Smith ’06,
the confusion began when he misread a
news release on the Davidson College
website about the “Hurricane Hugo Jug-
gling Festival.” Said Smith, “I was going to
check out my Juggalo message board
when I saw an article about what I
thought was Juggaloz. I thought I was
tripping, cause Davidson is the most stale
place in the world, filled with richies,
scrubs, and chickens, and I was gonna
have to give it some props finally, cause fi-
nally some of the Dark Carnival was
gonna reach the Echo Side up in this
place. Plus, I was thinking that I could fi-
nally meet myself a juggalette.”

Smith then posted the pertinent infor-
mation on the main Juggalo message
board, where news of the convention
spread quickly.

Expecting there to be a large meet-up
of Juggaloz, the ICP fans soon made
plans to be at Davidson from September
3 through September 5. Sure enough, on

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope: Prophets or
Just Rock Stars?

September 5 the deluge of Juggaloz be-
gan. “The satellite and Baker parking lots
were both filled,” recalled Pat Kelly '07,
“and there were all these guys with shaved
heads and face-paint milling around first
Belk. The line for the Union cafe was out
the door.”

The mix-up soon became obvious to
the Juggaloz, when instead of finding Vio-
lent J and Shaggy 2 Dope they found
Davidson College director of media rela-
tions, Bill Giduz, and other juggling afi-
cionados.

After the error became clear, some on
campus at first feared a riot of upset and
mislead students, but their worries
proved unfounded. Explained Mel Hall
‘05, “At first, those guys looked pretty
angry. I kept hearing them mention
something about ‘scrubs’ and being ‘down
with the clown.” But soon, they started

just hanging out around campus like

Davidson students. I met a bunch of
Juggaloz down at KA and then a whole
group of them watching Cast Iron Filter
at Summit. I could have sworn I even saw
one Juggalo in the 24 hour room at the
library.”
