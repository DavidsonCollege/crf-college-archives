SGA takes action

in response to student
recycling petition

On Tuesday, the SGA passed

a two-part Recycling Program

Resolution supporting an institu-

tionalized recycling program on
campus.

The resolution was prompted

by astudent petition circulated

cling on the Court and on fresh-
men halls, the recycling com-
mittee asked for $200 to buy
recycling bins. The money was
to come from the SGA’s discre-
tionary funds. The motion was
made by Vice President Warren
Buford.

While the vote to begin a
recycling program was unani-

which receive the bins would have
to sort their recyclables and carry
them toa shed about 50 feet from the
Student Health Center,

Phi Delt senator and hall coun-
selor Rick Onkey said during the
debate, “There is no way you are
going to get anybody in a fraternity

or on a hall to carry or sort any- -

thing.”
PiKA senator Kirk Rob-

on February 8 and 9 which
showed that 63 percent of stu-
dents on campus support an
institutionalized recycling pro-
gram and are willing to par-
ticipate in it.

The first part of the reso-
lution is designed to bring the
problem to the attention of
administrators and faculty.
The SGA hopes to draw their
support for the establishment
of such a program.

The second part was a stu-
dent-led Efforts Proposal to

take action in improving cur-
rent recycling efforts. This

“Hopefully through this
proposal we will get all of
the fraternities, eating
houses, the Union, and

freshman halls recycling.”

erts asked Whitehead why only
freshmen halls would be asked
to recycle.

She replied that it is easier
to start with freshmen halls be-
cause they tend to be more en-
thusiastic and involved in
projects suchas this. Also, she
said, “It will cost alot of money
to provide the bins.”

Senior Class President B.J.
Rudell also asked about start-
ing with freshmen halls. He
said if the petition showed that

came from seniors, the recy-
cling bins ought to be put in the
senior apartments. Whitehead
didn’t have any statistics about

backbone to our petition,” ac=

cording to Maria Whitehead, who
has led the crusade for recycling at
Davidson. “Hopefully, through
this proposal we will get all of the
fraternities, eating houses, the
Union, and freshmen halls recy-
cling.” The proposal was sent to
President John Kuykendall on
Wednesday for approval.

In order to implement recy-

mous, many senators had reser-
vations about allocating SGA
funds at this time.

Some senators felt that it
was unwise to buy the bins be-
fore consulting with fraternities,
eating houses, and freshmen halls
about their willingness to par-
ticipate.

Those organizations or halls

support by class.

In the end, the SGA tabled the
request for the $200. SAE senator
Will Cowan said, “Before we de-
cide anything, we need to find out

- who supports it.” Onkey said the

senators from Court houses should
“talk to their service coordinators”
ata house meeting to gauge support.
The debate will resume at
Tuesday’s SGA meeting.

Student Advisory |
Councils formed

By Mary C Lark JALONICK

SGA President Bill Gullan’s
first campaign promise has been
fufilled with the formation of three
new Student Advisory Councils.

Student Advisory Councils to
the Director of Auxilliary Services,
to the Director of Residence Life,
and tothe Director of Campus Safety
have all been created to, according
to Gullan, “get students together
with administrators and hopefully
find soultions on an informal level.”

“It is important that students
understand the administrators’ ra-
tionales for policy decisions, and it
is equally important that the admin-
istration remains in constant touch
with the student body,” says Gullan.

The councils will consist of
two co-chairs: one SGA senator

and one other student. The other
members will be a group of stu-
dents equally distributed by class
and demographics; they will sit on
the committee until they graduate.
The administrator will permanently
sit on the committee.

Gullan is currently attempt-
ing to formulate better relations
between the administration and
students.

He says, “I have informed the
faculty and the administration and
instructed the senators that no reso-
lution will get to the floor of the
SGA unless senators have con-
sulted with the appropriate admin-
istrators.

“No bombs will be dropped in
anybody’s lap, and no premature
action will ‘be taken by the SGA
senate while I am president,” says
Gullan.
