As Grads Return...

Once again we-are glad that that time of
year 1$ upon us, when we meet and
enterlain those avho have walked these
corridors before us. Many, however, did
not have the good fertune of walking these
SAME corridors; they were students here
in the days ef the Old Chambers Building.

In spite of the fact that they did not have
the iacilities and comforts, of which we
today ‘are too often unmindiul, they took
just as much pride and interest in their
work and eritertainment as we today do.

The scenes about Davidson have changed
greatly sinee those men were here. Never-
theless, the Davidson Spirit has not changed,
and this is tae main factor in making our
Alumni feel at home. ~ 7

We here today by means of our spirit and

‘good will can take our visitors again to the
joyful days they spent here. Their minds
will revert :o the minor incidences as well
as major objectives and acquaintances.

Shail those of thirty years ago ever for-
get the mecting en masse of the old cinder
blower? The engineer, recently retired, was
a dear triend to most of the boys, for often |
he would ride them to Charlotte on credit.
Never, though, did he forget the face of his
cicbtor. Many times he would recognize
one from his cabin and woaild colleet the
debt without moving from his seat at the
thrortle, -

Welcome Alumni...
~ Welcome home. Davidson grads: Once
“again, on Homecoming Day ~yo have at}
opportunity to return to the Alma Mater
en masse.

“ Davidson College has. done everything ,
possible to give you a day that wilt not be
easy to forget. ‘The toothall game, the cen-
tral event of the gathering. promises to
be one oi the best of the season, althongh |
the team faces formidable odds. A greater
Davidson spirit has pervaded the campus,
“ever sinee the Furman victory. Morale has
returned.

An alumni banquet has been planned
which will otfer the alumni a chance to.
gather together for a'short time and renew
old acquaintances,

Nor have other social aspects been over-
looked. The iraternity Houses will be open,
as is the usual custom after games. One of

the best sezs of Homecoming dances ia the +

history of the College has been planned.
But one preeantion should be mentioned. |
The fraternity houses and danees are anen
to sober alumni only.

Alumni, you owe something to your Col-
lege. In returning once a year, you pay in
some measure a debt to che College that you
will never be able to repay. Make the most
of u. Plan to enter whote-heartediy into

“the spirit of the day.

The Davidson student body welcomes you.
Every student should offer the returning
alumnus every convenience possible. Let’s
not be seliish about it. It is primarily a
day for the alumni.

Saturday is Homecoming Day. Make the
most of itt

Homecoming Lee

When we think of Homecaming Day we
think of it in terms of th& alumni and
friends. It is a time when they come troop-
ing back to the College. Theit coming al-
ways heartens us. Some one has defined a
friend as one who knows all about you and
still loves you. The alumni are just about
the best friends a college ever had. They
kriow aif about it on the inside and on the
outside, and still love it.

Spirit Returned...

Last week. The Davidsonian pubiisned a
pessimistic editorial in the hope that some
spint might be revived in a complacently
indilterent student body.

Whether our editorial helped ar not, we
do not know. We hope it did. However,
the Davidson Coltege spirit seems to per-
vade the campus atmosphere once more.

This spirit first evidenced itself in Fri-
day night’s pep meeting The cheering Sat-
ucday seemed improved. Again we hope that
the backing the student body offered helped
the team in some measure when they battled
on the gridiron, At any rate, something
happened and the team came out victorious.

Facing the odds offered by a team such
as the North Carolina team, requires some-

. thing more than a fighting team again. One
thing is necessary: a crescendo of spirit
reaching a climax on the day of the game,

Stough brothers for their generosity in in-
viting the whole student body to be their
guests at the theatre last Friday evening.
It was a fine gesture on their part and not-
iceably inereased the morale and Spirit of
the students. Not onty dd the boys appre-
ciate the invitation but very evidently en-
joyed the motion picture itseli.

- Remembering that a ‘iree show’ has not
occurred for quite a witile now, might we
not moralize to the extent of saying that so
long as one behaves 2s a crude and vulgar
person he can expeet to be treated as such
and when one behave 1: a gentleman then
he may expect treatry, " m others fitting

It made a deep impression on us a Monday
or two ago when, after‘cutting’ a class on
the week-end preceding, we went to the
dean’s office to have it fixed so that our cut
would not count double, to be asked to sign
this statement: “I did not attend the David-

WHY BAN THE
BIG APPLE?...

Dear Editor:

Two issues ago you had inter-
views prominent
members of the student body con-
cerning the question of banning the
Nig Apple and Lule Apple at Dav-
idson dances. Their statements
were very interesting. it was not
diffieuit to tell which ones knew
how to Appte. You remember the
story of the fox wiv had his tail

with several

' cut off and then tried to get all the

other foxes to eit theirs off also.
Is there any great ew connected
with the Big Apple? Tt seems to
me that, it© is a more wholesome
iorm of recreation than some other
It is certainly

forms of dancing.
= more exercise than most dances.

At least one of the Presbyterian
women's colleges have gone so far
as to allow the girls and their dates
to hold Big Apple dances on the
campus. Then why should an in-
nocent dance be condemned and
outlawed? Because some people
don't like it or can't dance it?
Do you prohibit bow ties because
you don't like them? Do you pro-
hibit green shirts because yours
is blue? T think not. Then why
be. narrow and censorious about
the Big Apple?

One accusation has. been that
Apple daneing is undignified, thus
being ont of place at Davidson. Is
it possibly iless dignified than the
“Bird in the Cage?” Than whistling
at young tadies at football games
and elsewhere? Than hissing
speakers and_ announcements in
chapel? Than booing at the the-
ater? Than — well, we won't men-
dion that. Anyway, it can hardly
be banned because of lack of dig-
nity. Neither do T see any justi-
fication for outlawing it because
everyoneycan’t do it. Everyone
can't waltz, or shag, or Westches-
ter, but we don’t. interfere with
those who can. The Big Apple is
not compulsory, and those who do
not like it do not need to dance it.
However, don't be a dog in the
manger. Someone must like it, or
it wouldn't have swept the country
as it has. Why not let those. who
enjoy—it-have-their innocent fun?

CONCERNING NEW-
FOREIGN POLICY...

The Editor a

| The Davidsonian:

In a news article of Oct. 13, The
Davidsonian stated atthe student
body. at least “the largest majority
of all, was in accord with the prin-
ciple in Roosevelt's recent forcign
policy, suggesting that war-mad
nations be ‘Quarantined. The public
is still in the dark concerning
Roosevelt's ‘Quarantine’ policy, but
in principle the student body ap-
proves.”

Who was it that said we don't|
know what the President is up to,
but whatever it is we are behind
hin?

Tn a press conference on Oct. 15,
Mr, Roosevelt made it clear to re-
porters “that any predictions of
United States foreign policy must
be pure guesswork, emphasizing
that he did not know what it would
be himself.” ‘This was carried on
the front page of the leading jour-
nals, yet nobody seems at all per-
turbed when a man who doesn't
know his own mind tries to lead a
country after he has already stated
his intention of substituting his own
ideas tor the law of the land. :

On the fifth of this month the
President made his Chicago speech.
The following day the State De-

;

}partment issued a statement on Ja-

pan, finding Japan to be acting in
violation of the Nine-Power Treaty
and the Kellog-Briand Pact. To-
gether these two moves mean that
Mr. Roosevelt has made a dead let-
ter of American neutrality policy
and is embarked on a new course
of dealing actively with agressor
nations,

So. far, we have been offered no
constructive plan. The President's
only eontribution “has been the.
nullification of the neutrality which
he pledged himself to support. —

Let us pause a moment to look

be held in the banquet hall of
Chambers Building.

Regretted fact that I did not at-|

tend a co-educational — institution
when Winthropites descended up-
on the campus this past week-end
—couples here and couples there
and no coupl-aints. Wonder what
would happen to that waiting list
we hear about if Davidson threw
open, the gates to the opposite SeX
—after observing strange actions of
some students Saturday, wonder
what would happen to us—however,
all for more lasses ahd less classes.
Note, too, the pleasing result it had
upon the football team — would
suggest we invite lady collegians in
group up every game.

Hustling males and blushing fe-
males met in the shade of Holt's
megaphone where they nervously
awaited words from Dictator Bar-
row — this worthy having spent
‘weeks of—study and observation
upon aforementioned males and fe-
males, thereby making list of pair-

Barrow-
and

ings — perfect couples,
baked. So they met,
“lines” came together and ambled

two

down to stadium, where two more
“lines” were having fun.

(An apology -for Swifty—coming
front Tennessee, ladies, his natural
southern charm is engulfed by
that ungodly Tennessee accent, so
naturally he tried to flee, turning
you over to his North Carolina
éousin, Sam. For your benefit, al-
so, other afflicted members of our
group include Lyons, Warden, Gas-
teiger, Heilman, dc. — 'yknow Ten-
nessee, though),

All in all, everybody had a swell
time however, No Bits, No
Watkins spent very negative after-
noon... Hayseed Thomas delayed
departure of buses as he enter-
tained very convincingly... Tom
Henderson, Paul McGarity (both
supposedly ‘regulars'), and Tred
Smith flashing wits for pleasure of
fair sponsor . . . Cooper twins and
fmore charming lady twins posing
for pictures’... Bill Kiesewetter,
without the girl who stood him up
-—he's too popular for me, she says
—she read his fan mail,

Football scason. Old grads,
best girl, the family for some, the
big game. Not to—mention the
dance set with Earl Mellen fur-
nishing the music for both dances.
The fraternities wilt also be hold-
ing banquets before and after the
dances in Charlotte and feeds and
gel-togethers at the frat houses
here. in Davidson. The decorating
,of the fraternity houses will add
quite a touch of that well known
week-end spirit too. All in all it
looms up as being one of the big-
gest and best in the history of ye
‘olde schoole.

FLOWERS... Wasn't it last
year that the pohey of no corsages
was considered on this campus?
Anyway, it scems that several of
the better colleges in the east and
middle west have carried out this
idea with very satisfactory results.
The students at the Woman’s Col-
lege of the University of North
Carolina in Greensboro express
their sentiments with this state-
ment: “Less flowers but more and
better dances.” It all amounts to
the same amount of money. Put
your corsage money on good or-
chestras for each dance._

WHAT, AGAIN? ... Yes, again,
The water tank we mean. Why it's
hot even fair to paint it again with-
out finding out who the culprit
was in the first incident. However

2:30 P. M.—Homecoming foot-
ball game with the University of
N. C. on Richardson Field.

9:00 P. M.-12 Midnight—Pan-
Hellenic Council witl sponsor an

ercise. os —

in

the statement on the tank will
probably mect with more approval
this time than the first. If you re-
member correctly there was one
class in particular that didn't like
the wording of the first creation.

STRANGE ANGLE ... Does the
College expect.the water tank to
be painted every year? No? Then
why do they have an insurance pol-
icy that covers the Probability of a
eee
at the Neutrality Act. There has
been some question as to whether
it made it mandatory for the Pres-
ident to issue a proclamation and
establish an embargo.- It reads:

“Whenever the President shall find |

that there exists a state of war...
the President shall proclaim such

fact. and it shall be thereafter «un-

Day

By CHUBBY KING

Suppose you noticed excessive
amount of low grades ... what's
that all play and no work makes
Jack a dull boy — and a freshman
(already stupid) a bit. on the im-
becite side. Freshmen should real-
ize now that since, no re-exams are
given this either pass
three or pass out. It seems that
with such large numbers of stu-
dents refused admittance, that our
selective system could be improved
upon. Select the students before
they get here, rather than flunk
them out after they are in.

At Women's College this weck-
end, Pete McKnight led rebeltious
group and = reintroduced banned
“Little Apple” — was with Eleanor
Kerchner, Mark Lillard with Betsy
Wharton, John Withers with Anna
Steele, and Warren Gaw with Jane
Umstead . . . Dick Wright, Hal-
loweenishly clad — band uniform—
and Joe Craver ~ ROTC uniform—
parading the streets of Salisbury.

Halloween in Charlotte—all sorts
of horrible-looking persons prom-
enading the streets, blowing un-
earthly, horns and making irritat-
ing sounds with distorted voices—
Davidson cat-callers, booers, and
so forth were right at home in this
particular group.

But, with the nicer element .. .
Philip E. Mayhew, the DuPont
man, entertained with his friend
the judge, Mr. Black, and the D.A.

Thomas . . . Colonel Liipfert de-
livered melancholy melody, “In My
Solitude,” quite impressively.

Take It Easy
By Rut Miller

HOMECOMING ... It’s fast ap- Davidson student falling from the
proaching, this big week-end of the | tank2- They -do, according to the
the | latest rumors.

NEVER THE TWAIN SHALL
MEET: .. But that's just what will
happen when Davidson mects Har-
vard at Cambridge in two weeks._
And in more ways than football;
too. For Prof. Pfohl is planning to
even pick cotton upon that north-
ern sod. The program presented
at the Furman game wilt be car-
ried out at the Harvard game but
upon a more elaborate scale. He
is furthermore taking his own cot-
ton and negro boys to pick the cot-
ton. Ain't that sumpin’? .

ANOTHER THUMB NAIL .

This one is also a senior and rooms
in Watts. Again he has an Adonis-
like body and pleasing personality.
Yle was the recipient of>an honor
last week that is the goal of all. A_
blonde of about five fect ten inches
and rather a dandy with the ladies.
He is especially well known for his
association with lizards and jan-
itors. Incidentally he makes -him-
self cospicuous at football games
and has quite a bit to do with pep
meetings.

THOUGHT OF THE WEEK ...
