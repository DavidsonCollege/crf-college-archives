Lacrosse

Makes
History

By Robert Lloyd-Still

Wednesday, March 10 marked
an historic event in the history of
women’s athletics at Davidson. The
women's lacrosse team played its
very first matchat the varsity level.
On a spring break trip from New
York, Cortland State came for a
scrimmage. The ‘Cats played hard
but fell to the more experienced
Red Dragons by a score 16-9.

Last season the women’s la-
crosse team played a club sched-
ule. This year the competition will
increase immensely because the
‘Cats will face all Division III op-
ponents. The ‘Cats will even face
Washington & Lee, a team ranked
in the top twenty by many pre-
season polls.

In the match against Cortland
State, Megan Snyder played ex-
tremely well for Davidson. Of the
nine goals the ‘Cats scored, she
managed seven of them.

Davidson women’s coach,
Betsy Brown, summed up the teams
performance: “This was a great
learning experience for both my-
self and the team. We didn’t play

-our best, but we did play well,
especially for the first time out. We
held our own against a very good
team.”

Davidson isa very young team
led by senior captain Jenny
Plowright. After helping to revi-
talize the women’s basketball pro-
gram for the last two years,
Plowright will lead the ‘Cats in
their developmental stages. The
lacrosse team also expects big sea-
sons out of freshmen Hedy
Moolenaar, Anne, Sutton, Amy
Craigin and sophomores Allison
Adams, Nancy Hilles, and Liz
Schaper.

On Tuesday March 30,
Davidson students can catch their
first glimpse of the lacrosse team
when they face Greensboro Col-
lege at 4:30 p.m.

scribed the experience at Hilton
Head: “The whole week was one
of rearranging, rainouts, and re-
scheduling. I think we were on the
lucky side because we actually
played three matches.”

The ‘Cats defeated
Georgetown handily by a score of
9-0. Atnumber one singles, Jenni-
fer Beahm came back after drop-
ping the first set 6-0 to win the last
two sets 6-4 and 7-5. The team
then faced Marshall, winning hand-

ily 7-1. Beahm gave another out-
standing performance, winning a
hard fought match 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 to
lead the Wildcats in a match that

, did not count toward Southern

Conference play, but gives the team
confidence for their match later in
the year.

The team’s final match was
against Seton Hall, where the 'Cats
fell 5-4 for team’s second loss of
the season. Tasha Ruth and Bar-
bara Grooms teamed up for the

squad's only doubles victory with
outstanding play. At number one,
Cyndi Hess gave a super effort
with an impressive victory over
Seton Hall’s top player.

“The Seton Hall match could
have easily gone either way,” said
coach Caroline Price. “Because it
was an intra-conference match, we
had our number four doubles team
in the number three spot'and they
lost a tough one in three sets. Then
we had an injury substitution at

number four singles, where
Susannah Cobb played a very com-
petitive match, but lost 6-2, 6-3.”

After break, the team opened -
its Southern Conference play with
aneasy victory over Georgia South-
ern, 7-2. The team’s record is now
7-2 on the season including a vic-
tory over Georgia Tech.

From now until the end of the
season, Davidson will play exclu-
sively Southern Conference oppo-
nents. —

In Davidson’s last tennis
match, they jumped on the Spiders
early by taking the doubles point
and never looked back as the team
coasted to a 5-2 victory. This win
came after a defeat to the Univer-
sity of South Carolina, ranked 22nd
in the nation. Davidson’s record
now stands at 5-1 on the year.

The ‘Cats looked stronger in
the doubles than they have all year
against Richmond. Russell Briggs
and Ryan Harper earned a tough
victory at number one doubles,
winning in a tie breaker 9-8 (11-9).
Harper said of the match, “This
was our best win yet this year.”
Albie Varoski and Chris Parker
also played excellent doubles in an

Wildcat Baseball Battles Opponents, Weather

By Will Cobb

As the baseball team reaches
the season’s midpoint, it has real-
ized how uncooperative weather
can be. The team was only able to
play six of its scheduled twelve
games over break. And last week,
the team only managed to play one
game.

The team has struggled of late
and they continue to lose close
games by one or two runs.
Davidson lost five of their last six
against such tough opponents as
N.C. State (#10), Duke (#25), and
Maryland. Defense has caused
many of the problems for the ‘Cats.
They are atthe bottom of the South-
ern Conference defensively with a
.945 fielding percentage and 34
unearned runs.

The ‘Cats have kept the bats
swinging, averaging six and ahalf
earned runs per game. Mac
Chapman has led the team in hit-
ting with a .377 batting average
with sixteen RBIs and four home
runs. Also having a great season is
senior Tim Kerms, who has brought
his batting average upto .371 while
leading the team in RBIs withnine-

teen along with four home runs.
‘The toughest hitter so far has been
Brett Boretti, who in 69 at bats, has
been struck out only six times.
For the pitchers, junior Chris

’ Carrigan has been a pleasant sur-

prise, pitching 35 innings with an
ERA of 4.33. Randy Spaw has a
record of 3-2 in 41 innings with an
ERA of 5.05. Another bright spot
appears to be freshman Brian
Krehmeyer, who has been given a
considerable amount of playing
time so far this season. He has a
record of 1-1 in 21 innings with an
ERA of only 3.92, while giving up
23 hits, ©

“We're still trying to find a set
rotation,” said Coach Dick Cooke,
“which we had hoped to do this
week, but the weather didn’t coop-
erate. Still, we have a number of

_ freshmen who have shown that

they deserve some innings.”

The team stands at 3-5 in the
conference, including a win over
The Citadel, but was rained out at
App. State and that game will not
be rescheduled. The team’s next
home game will be this Wednes-
day against Harvard at 3:00 p.m.
