THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE THREE

After drawing a com-
plete blank on the 1953
gridiron and David-
son’s most recent ath-
letic defeat at the
hands of tiny Guilford
on the _ basketball
courts, the athletic
thought of the David-
. son student hit a boil-
* ing point after Wed-
nesday night's cage lid
opener. This reporter
was bombarded with
such a host of com-
ments and __ proposals

8 that we feel that we
By JOHN HANDLEY cannot conscientiously
overlook the feelings of the students whose printed organ
we are pledged to be.

Ever since taking over this post we have listened with
growing interest to the various comments and appraisals
of the Davidson situation and recommendations and proposals
for its possible betternment. Feeling in the past that to
print such usually only hot-tempered “steaming” would be
at the sacrifice of team spirit and morale without actually
gaining anything in return.

Not a Criticism, But a Questioning

In reality our feeling is still much the same and we
will recruit your aid in thinking through what seems to have
become a real problem here. We _ will not here offer any
word ‘of criticism for anyone in the sports setup here at
Davidson, not from fear of reprisal from the powers that
be, but rather, from the failure to see any actual rewards
to be gained by such action.

We wholeheartedly beg your interest in this problem of
Davidson’s thinking toward sports and we would request
your writing or talking to us concerning this matter. You
will here, of course, recognize on our part the age-old prac-
tice of “passing the buck,” but this results only from lack
of a definite opinion ourselves. We feel certain that some
of the members of the student body have given this matter
careful thought and we invite you to air your views and
share your views with your fellow students.

Grumbling Isn’t The Answer

Suppressed grumbling and Davidson’s famous griping
seems to us to be of little avail and actually to hurt rather than
to help the college community.

We would like here to bring to your attention some of
the questions which have come to us for your consideration
and thought. Should Davidson continue in its same course in
athletics, or should it go all-out, or should it withdraw in favor
of an intensified intramural program. Are sports on the Da-
vidson scene really “character-building and leadership- build-
ing, etc., etc.,” as sports were originally meant to be? Does
the problem lie, not within, but without the local campus?
That is, is it the current conception of collegiate sports on a
national scene—the pressures, etc.,—that are the underlying
causes of these problems? Should Davidson take the lead in any

movement to bring sports down out of their Roman spectacle}

stratisphere?

These may embrace only a few of the questions which
you may be thinking about. In any case we welcome your
opinions and comments and will gladly reproduce here any
pertinent, intelligent, and logical comments you may bring
to our attention.

We wish to represent the feelings of the Davidson student
and it is our sincere belief that it is time such feelings be
aired rather than to continue in the unhealthy situation which

prevails at present.

at Chapel Hill. The Cat schedule

The team will be built around
returning lettermen like Al Or-

captain the aquamen and Ormond

The varsity swimmers won only
one tilt last year, but were showing
much improvement as the season
closed. This year’s team will miss
the efforts of several regulars who
were lost to graduation last June.

There is also quite a bit of en-
thusiasm among the freshman
team which has been working hard
and will be a great asset to the
varsity in future years. The fresh-
man schedule has not been released
as yet.

The varsity meets to be held in

scene.

“Doc” has the official sounding
title of equipment manager. He is
concerned with keeping each squad
well dressed and well equipped.
You can usually find “Doc” in his
“office” in the basement of the
gym at any time of day, where he
is always busy patching and dis-
tributing equipment.

“Doc” has been at Davidson now
for twenty years, having first ar-
rived on the campus in 1933. In
that time he has become almost
an “institution,” especially to the
great number of boys who have
been fortunate enough to come into
contact with him.

Stilt Young

‘Doc” is as active as ever at 62
and hes plans for many more years
at Davidson. He has been married
for the past twenty-seven years.

“Doc's” real name is Perry, how-
ever this has been all but for.
gotten on the campus where he is
never known by any other title
than “Doc.” This has become s0
much a fixture with him that once
a visitor to the school asked for
the office of Doctor White.

Friendly Philosopher

“Doc” is always anxious to dis-
pense with a little of his home-
spun philosophy—one of his fa-
vorite topics being why someone
should beat the New York Yan-
kees, But “Doc” doesn't limit him-
self to one topic and will talk
about almost anything.

This soft-spoken little man with
his ready smile and friendly word
of advice has worked his way into
the heart of every Davidson athlete
for the past twenty years, not to
mention the many others of the
student body who have come to
know and love this wonderful man.

spot, as Guilford squeezed by the
varsity 63-56.

It was a team win for Coach
Fetzer's charges, as all the start-
ing five hit the double figures.
Alec Shepard's 19 and 18 for Gay-
lord Walker were high for the
night, with George Mitchell, David
Shaw and Buster Jenkins getting
10 each for Davidson. Jenkins and
the two Shaw brothers, David and
Bob, were all floor leaders, with
David gathering in most of the re-
bounds.

The defensive play was very
good, on the whole. Pfieffer was
held to 28 points, only 15 the
whole first half, until they broke
loose to score 29 in the third
period. The Wildkittens regained
control, however, to end the game
going away.

year, but will also prove invalu-
