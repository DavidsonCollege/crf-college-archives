In reference to last week’s article about the weights being
moved, presently the situation is still such that one may only
work out with a supervisor present. To this I would like to
speak. The new rule about supervision is supposed to apply to
everyone, and yet Wednesday a week ago when I went to the
weight room while the football team was working out, there was
not a coach or faculty member to be found. According to one
football player this is not an isolated occurence. He says, ‘“The
coach isn’t in there half the time anyways.’’ If varsity sports are
going to make rules which are supposedly in everyone’s best
interest (i.e. safety) then they should at least abide by their own
guidelines.

Here’s a letter someone sent in about last week’s column
about trouble in the weight room:

Hey youse paperboys—

Me and the boys, we thinks its cool what we having them
weights to ourselves and all. But so as nobody thinks we maybe
unfair or something, why not try this: All them math rats can
have the computer all to theirselves, just like we got them
weights, you see what I’s saying. Like, amateurs could really
screw up them fancy calculators without a instructor keeping
their eyes on ’em. :

Same goes for music wimps and practice rooms. And Jesus
majors and DCPC. And the b-ball team’s gym—keep out.

The way I’m seeing it, each person has their own thing and
everybody else ought to stay the hell away. That’s what I’m
hear on scholarship for, you read me?

Like my man Bingham says, the important thing is that
nobody sues the school for hurtin theirself.

Wrestlers destroy Paladins in SC contest

By PAUL GRIFFITH
Staff Writer

Last Saturday, in Johnston
Gym, the Davidson wrestlers
annihilated the Paladins of Fur-
man by an overwhelming score
of 51-4. In an obvious unders-
statement, Coach Bob Estock
commented, ‘Everybody
wrestled well.”

In the first Davidson-Furman
confrontation earlier in the year
the score was quite a bit closer.
About that match Estock said,
“We were fighting for our lives,
it wasn’t decided until the final
match.’’ This time, though,
“everything clicked.”

Estock believes that the
wrestlers’ hard work is really
paying off now. ‘‘We are put-
ting everything together. Our
moves and techniques are sharp
and we are stronger,”’ he said.

’The individual winners a-
gainst Furman who pinned their
opponents were John Breiden-
stine (150 pounds), Tim Bro-
therton (158 pounds), and Bob
Kear (167 pounds). Eric Hill
(118 pounds), Scott Smith (134
pounds) and Lance Stokes (142
pounds) won by superior deci-
sions. Hill'ran up a score of 14-0
, Smith 17-0 and Stokes 22-5.

in the heavier weights David-
son, received points for three
forfeits, but by that time the
match was already in the bag.

The team leaders in the
win/loss category are junior
Scott Smith (15-6), freshman
John Briedenstine (14-6-1), and
sophomore Van Wagner (6-2).
Wagner was out for a few weeks
with an injury. Estock said he
should be ready to wrestle again
by this weekend.

Davidson’s win over Furman -

gives the wrestlers: a 2-2 Sou-
thern Conference record and a
6-5 overall record.

By JIM CROWE

Davidson swimmers contin-
ued their winning ways in

Charlotte last weekend with .

well-executed team efforts and
several excellent individual per-
formances.

Victories over William and
Mary (68-45) and Washington
& Lee (72-39), and the season’s
only loss, dealt by a powerful
‘Furman squad (47-64), brought
Davidson’s season record to
8-1.

On Friday, Davidson easily
overcame William and Mary
with a solid team outing. Da-
vidson swimmers won both the
400 yard free relay (3:22.4) and
the 400 medley relay (3:46.9)
and placed well in all individual
events.

Junior Mike Schremmer took
the 1000 yard free (10:15.3) and

‘the 500 yard free (4:56.3), while
junior Warren Beck also took

two firsts, winning the 200 yard
free (1:50.7) and 200 yard back
(2:07.1) Both swam on the
winning 400 yard free relay
team.

Saturday, the Wildcats
soundly defeated Washington &
Lee. Davidson performed well
in this dual meet, Coach Pat
Miller explained, while Wash-
ington & Lee did not swim a
very strategic lineup.

The ’Cats took the 400 yard
medley relay (3:53.34) and had
the best time in the 400 yard
free relay (3:19.56) in an exhibi-
tion run.

Mike Schremmer again took
first in the 1000 yard free
(10:05.87) and the 500 yard free
(5:01.64). His time in the 1000
free set a new Davidson school

’ record, surpassing the old mark .

by over eight seconds.
Davidson team members took
firsts in all individual events at
the 200 yard length. Craig
Finger won both the 200 yard
individual medley (2:05.51) and

the 200 yard fly (2:04.4). War-

ren Beck took firsts in the 200

but fall to strong Paladins , stand at 8-1

(2:21.17).

In diving competition, sopho-
more Frank Bright placed well
by winning both one meter and
three meter diving with point
scores of 220.4 and 237.75
respectively.

This sam performance that
defeated Washington & Led
72-39 left Davidson in the loss
column against Furman. Coach
Miller said that Furman’s depth
is very hard to beat.

Furman took both team re-
lays and seven firsts in eleven
individual events. Craig Finger
gave the Wildcats something to
cheer about as he maintained
his undefeated record in the 200
individual medley. schremmer’s
record-breaking run was good
for a first in the 1000 free.

Bright won three meter div-
ing and Riddle’s 2:21.17 in the
200 yard breast also placed
first.

Coach Miller expressed
thanks to members of the
Davidson community who
served as staff at the meets in
Charlotte.

This weekend -the Wildcats
line up for four dual meets.
