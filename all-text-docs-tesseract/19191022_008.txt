FALL
CLOTHING

Another Fall Is Here

We notice that here and there the leaves
are turning brown---summer is passing away.
But the sure signs of autumn are found inside
our store. The new fall clothing for men is I
on the racks. ,. And{we are mighty proud of /
these new garments. They look good on the |
racks. They are going to look still better
when they get where they belong---on the |
backs of men. And what’s best of all, we
know the material of which they are made {
and that they are tailored as well as clothing ||
can be tailored. The big surprise isthatthese i
garments are priced unexpectedly low.

;ccnnection with his study of economics.

There are ten counties in his district,
and there will be two hundre! enume-
rators appointed. He has selected Prof.
A. Currie as his chief assistant and Miss
Dorothy Finlayson as his secretary and
stenographer,

Dr. McConnell is a very wise choice,
on account of his great interest in the
study of economics, and a better man
for the place: would have been hard to
find.
