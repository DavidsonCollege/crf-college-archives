A Land-Grant College

Davidson Mayor Tom Sadler in-
dicated this week that federal funds
are now available for the Town of
Davidson to construct new homes for
those living in substandard housing in
the area. This is good news, but the
problem exists to find the land on
which to build.

It is unlikely that any landowner in
Davidson other than the college has
sufficient holdings of land to make
such a housing project possible.

_In the interview with Dr. Spencer
and Mr. Currie printed in the Sept. 27
issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN, Spen-
cer maintained that because the
college can not find alternative
housing for those now living in the
alleged substandard structures, they

have been allowed to remain where
they are. Yet Spencer and Currie in-
sist that the college “‘would like to get
out of the housing business’’. The
solution seems evident.

We encourage the college to
examine its land holdings and find a
100 acre area which would be suitable
for a housing construction pfoject.
We encourage the college to sell this
land to the town for the purpose of
alleviating the problems of all sub-
standard housing in Davidson. -

This seems the most natural and
practical option for the college to pur-
sue if it is truly interested in bettering
the housing conditions in Davidson.

Abandoning Blinders A Land-Grant

Thé function of a stugent-run
newspaper on a college campus is not
universally agreed upon. On a cam-
pus such as this one, where apathy
reigns and conservatism is the rule,
the newspaper role is clouded further.

In recent weeks this paper has
sought to investigate issues normally
swept under the rug. These efforts
have produced mixed reviews on
campus, though the off-campus reac-
tion has been very good.

Student reaction has been. in-
teresting. While a few seem pleased
that ‘‘all of this is finally out’’ a
seemingly equal number resent the

generally dilapidated surface only
perpetuates the problems to which
these tenants have resigned them-
selves.

We would like to see students in-
volved in bettering conditions in the
community. We as students are a part
of the college, and we feel it is the
responsibility of the college to better
the housing conditions. — ot Ge

As students, we are paying the
college to maintain its property. Im-
mediately, the responsibility for
maintenance lies with the ad-
ministration and staff. We expect
them to handle our money well, using

negative publicity the paper ha&.enough foresight to prevent con-

given the college.

Certainly all is not right at David-
son. The laundry situation is con-
troversial, and therefore news. The
same holds true for other issues
we’ve investigated. News is not
publicity. It is information presented
for review, be it good or bad.

When the news is.slanted, the press
is rightfully taken to task. Both sides
need to be heard. Concerning the
housing story of a few weeks ago, we
granted a full page for an interview

with Dr. Spencer and Mr. Currie to:

present their views and opinions of
the college-owned housing in the
Davidson black community.

Students are ill-served by adopting
a policy of wearing blinders to all
“uncomfortable issues.”’ One student
letter to the editor deplores our lack
of concern over the. housing issue

because no students were pictured —

- with paintbrushes and trash cans.
Had students realized that such con-
ditions existed, perhaps they would
have given a hand in repairing broken
windows or rat-eaten walls and

floors. Yet to put new patches on a

}

ditions such as substandard housing.
If such conditions do exist though, we
expect the administration to exert
some leadership in alleviating the
problems.

We are extremely disappointed that
the college administration and many
students apparently ‘feel that our

housing story reflects no concern for
the tenants in poor housing in this

‘community nor any editorial leader-

ship asking the administration to

ameliorate these problems.

We are disappointed that such an
investigation has been called sen-
sationalism, and are equally disap-

| pointed that Dr. Spencer will not meet

with students at the present time to

discuss student involvement in |

solving an admittedly difficult
problem in providing housing that is
more than simply adequate.

We the editors and staff of THE
DAVIDSONIAN are here for a pur-
pose. To provide the community of
Davidson with a newspaper that in-
forms and entertains.

We are a newspaper, not a
‘propaganda machine.

Copper Increases

Cerebral

As I was making a nightly
pilgimage to the fourth Watts
hot water spigot a few nights

ago, I happened to notice a

strange orange and gray sub-
stance covering the floor and
encroaching upon the walls. —

With a brilliant leap of logic
I realized this was not mere
Cannon water fight residue, se
I whipped out my pocket
microscope(cunningly hidden
in the false bottom of my tea
cup) and began a tentative
analysis.

With aid from a Chemistry
major who assured me he had
just “‘wandered up’’ to the
fourth floor,(he told me that
he always breathed
heavily-the steps hadn’t af-
fected him at all,) we made an
exciting discovery. The sub-
stance saturating Watts as
well as Cannon and Richar-
dson was a combination of
zine and copper.

I was elated at the
revelation, for this proved that
Davidson freshmen were ac-
tually the paragons of in-
telligence that they thought
they were. The superabun-
dance of zinc and copper
piling up in the freshman
dorms substantiates the work
of Dr. Adon A. Gordus, a
Chemistry professor at the
University of Michigan.

Through his studies, Dr.
Adon A. Gordus found that
students with the highest
grade point averages have
higher than normal zinc and
copper deposits in their hair,
coupled with a lower iodine
content. This last finding ac-
counts for the fact that the
only place on campus in which
a wounded freshman can find
iodine is Duke Dorm.

Though the Admissions Of-
fice outdid themselves with
the class. of ’78(note zine and
copper deposits outside the

Capacity

E.H. Little Library) ,it would:
benefit the admission depart-
ment to require a lock of each
student’s hair with his ap-
plication. — .

Besides allowing the ad-
missions office positive proof
of Davidson quality, such a
policy, if adopted by all
colleges, would tend to
discourage students from ap-
plying to a great many
schools. And one practical ap-
plication of the freshman
largesse would be to create a
special maintenance crew to
pick up our deposits, sell the
zinc and copper to mining
companies and -place. the
profits in the Davidson en-
dowment.

But, a final word of advice
for all the upperclassmen who
are tearing their hair ina fren-
zy. If you want to add more
zinc to your diet, and hope it
races up to your hair follicles,
eat oysters and pure maple
syrup. For a superb culinary
and cerebral feast, boil your
oysters in maple syrup for din-
ner tonight, and watch, the
freshmen quietly usurp your
place at your eating club.

ting Thomases, Adon A. Gor-
dus does exist and can be
found on page 139 of the Sep-
tember-October 1973 issue of\
“The Saturday Evening
Post’).
