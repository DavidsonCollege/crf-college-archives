4 New Professorships |

The Charles A. Dana Founda-
tion. Inc., has announced that
Davidson College will receive
$250,000 for the establishment of
four Charles A. Dana Profes-
sorships.

“For several years we have
been assisting colleges and uni-
versities with funds for build-
ings and [acilities,"’ said Charles
A. Dana. founder of the pro-
gram.

“Eight years ago."’ he contin-
ued, ‘‘we established a continu-
ing scholarship program in 10
colleges which will have a total
of 600 Dana Scholars next year.

“It appeared to me and the
trustees of the foundation that a
third area of need, for many
colleges with small endowments
was that of the significant sup-
port which would bring outstand-
ing faculty members.”

sum with another $250,000 and
place it in an endowment fund.

According to the foundation's
plan. Charles A. Dana Profes-
sors must be teaching rather
than administrative personnel.

The college will provide a sal-
ary for a Dana Professorship
equivalent to the average sal-
ary for a full professor. To this
salary a share of the annual in-
come from the grant will be
added. ;

Robert J. Sailstad, director of
publi; relations and develop-
ment, said that the professor-
ships can be awarded to either
present or new members of the
faculty. “The actual date has
not been announced for the
awarding of the grant, but it
will be announced as soon as
possible.”

President D. Grier Martin re-
marked that ‘‘this splerdid and

timely gift is another expression
of the remarkable insight which
Mr. Dana and his associates
have regarding the most press-
ing problems that face a college
such as Davidson.

“We are proceeding at once
to raise by means of our current
Ford Challenge Program the
$250.000 which Davidson must
provide to qualify to participate
in the Dana Professorship Pro-
gram.”

The other schools which are
involved in the program are

Doughnuts, Philosophy

Blending a mixture of old-
time religion into his views on
today’s fast-paced society, the
Grim Baker of Mooresville con-
tinues his role as the midnight-
til-dawn philosopher of the Da-
vidson community

The Grim Baker, formally
known as R. C. Powers. oper-
ates the Mooresville Bakery, fre-
quented by many early-morning
Davidson scholars.

Powers admits that his busi-
ness with college students has
fallen off a bit this year, but
figures that the upcoming exam
period should see a return of
many familiar faces.

“TI always like to know their
names, sort of building up a fam-
ily here at the bakery,” Pow-
ers reminisced. The Grim Baker
listed Barry Sickles, Dick Hurd,
Fred Sackett and Andy Clay as
four of the more recent mem-
bers of his illustrious ‘family,’

although Clay had only been by
twice this year.

“Andy used to come two or
three times a week.”’ Powers
sighed, ‘‘but this year he said he
was going to study.

“Davidson students seldom get
on my nerves,’ Powers contin-
ued, luoking back on 40 years at
the same location. °

Powers voiced strong opinions

on the new morality that is
creeping into today’s society,
ranging from long hair to liq-
uor. “Sometimes I just get
plain disgusted with these fellas
with long hair,"’ muttered the
Grim Baker. ‘Why, it's a dis-
grace to wear long hair, because
it’s a symbol of woman's self-
pride and man’s weakness."

When someone mentioned that
Jesus probably wore his hair
long. the baker cried that “he
was the most brutally treated
man of all time.”

Himself a Bible class teacher
at Prospect Presbyterian Church
(“the mother church of David-
son College’’), Powers repeated-
ly revealed his extensive know-
ledge of Biblical! verises in sup-
porting his opinions.

Pointing to his assistant, J. W.
Robbins, Powers reported that
“his grandfather was in on the
meeting that set. up Davidson.
and it was set up as a religious
school primarily to train minis-
ters." He bemoaned the fact
that ‘“‘that just isn’t so any
more."

Powers said he had even
heard of students who were now
talking down the Bible, that the
Bible had little relevance in to-
day’s world. Disgustedly the
baker reported that one student,
either at Davidson or Chapel
Hill, had proclaimed “If you're
going to take liquor and women

Given

September 1968 has been set
as the tentative date for institu
tion of the revised curriculum.
according to a memorandum of
the Blue Sky Committee releas-
.ed this week.

The release also sets forth a
proposed ‘‘multi-track’’ curric-
ulum for different-quality stu-
dents and greatly increased in-
terdepartmental work.

The memorandum, released
Wednesday, advocates the pres-
ervation of present curriculum

break away from traditional pro
grams and attempting both tried
and untried innovations.

APPROVAL ASSUMED

It is also to be assumed by
the committee that the college
will implement any curriculum
changes which it proposes.

The memorandum = supports
both greater student initiative in
selecting courses and the utiliza-
tion of educational experiences
not presently available.

The ‘multi-track’ system will
offer programs for exceptional,
above average and average stu-
dents.

Objectives of the committee
were listed in the memorandum
as providing the Davidson stu-
dent with an understanding of
mankind's achievements: an
awareness of the institutions,
symbols and technologies of the
modern world; a desire for in-
volvement in the world: an in-
clination to continue learning
and to be open-minded: a facil-
ity in one discipline and an abil-
ity to express himself clearly in
English and in one foreign lan-
guage.

TIMETABLE SET

The timetable released in the
committee's memorandum _in-
cludes subcommittee reports to
be received by March 1! and
April 1. New curriculum pro-
posals to be completed by Oct.
1 and implementation plans to
be completed by Feb. 1, 1968.

Review and analysis of the
subcommittee reports. including
the report of the Subcommittee
on Curriculum Structure, will be
conducted from April 1 to June
1.

Proposals for the new curric-
ulum will be written from June
1 to Sept. 1. Review by student.
trustee .and faculty groups and
modification of the proposals
will be made from Sept. 1 to
Oct. 1.

The proposals will be sub-
mitted to the faculty at the first
meeting in October. Final devel-
opment of the plans will take
place Feb. 1. 1968.

The new catalogue will be is-

Does Alcohol

What goes on at schools
that allow, either openly or
tacitly, drinking on cam-
pus?

To answer the question,
DAVIDSONIAN staffer Ed
Embree contacted news-
papers at Eastern and
Southern colleges and uni-
versities to gain a perspec-
tive on Davidson's drink-
ing problem.

Embree‘’s story can be

Plans are now being laid by
the administration for the im
plementation of the new science
program made possible by the
Sloan Foundation.

“We will develop a two
year interdisciplinary course in
science,”’ Martin said, ‘to in
clude subject matter from
chemistry, physics, and biolo-
gy. and to be supported by work
in mathematics and in the philo.
sophy of science.”

Dean of Faculty Frontis W.
Johnston emphasized that ‘the
basic purpose of the course will
be to strengthen education in
the sciences by min‘mizing the
classical compartmental char-
acter of biology, chemistry and
physics, and at the same time.
preserve the rigor and preci-
sion possessed by the tradition
al courses. The laboratory ap
proach will also be revised to
provide opportunities for ex-
ploration rather than merely
observation.”

In introducing the program in
the fall of 1967, Davidson plans
to admit only 25 freshmen and
sophomeres initially, as it is
felt that the objectives of the
course can only be reached
through dependence on ‘‘the
enthusiasm. knowledge and
imag’nation of the instructors

curriculum instituted in Septem-
ber, 1968.

Sloan Grants College
$250,000 For Science

A $250,000 grant‘to the college.
made public this week, will
make possible. an inter-disci-
plnary science program for
freshmen and sophomores.

President,D. Grier. Martin was
in New York Wednesday to
formally accept the grant, from
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

and on the quality of the stu-
‘dents,’ Johnston commented.

“We think this attraction can
be especially strong for pro-
spective teachers in the high
school, many of whom are re.
pelled from the idea of science
teaching by the rigor and ex-
clusiveness of ¢he traditional
program,"' he said. ‘Further,
a program such as we propose
should be even more attractive
to preministerial and premedi-
cal students, to whom a broader
understanding of the methods
and importance of science is
desirable,” added Johnston.

' “We propose to staff the
program with as imaginative a
group as we can assemble, and
the college proposes to give
them, within. the bounds of
reasonable academic proce-
dures, a free reign for experi
mentation."

Among areas from chemistry
to be covered during the first
year will be descriptive inor.
ganic; equilibrium and thermo-
dynantick; analytical chemistry.
qualitative and quantitative:
atomic ‘structure and chemical
bonding; kinetics; electro-chem-
istry and topics in organic
chemistry.

Physics topics will include
mechanics and wave motion.

thermal physics. electricity and
magnetism, light and modem
physics quantum effects and re
lativity.

The biology area will include
topics in cell biology. such as
membrane phenomena, bio-
energetics and molecular biolo-
gy of the gene.

The first year will involve six
class hours a week. and two
three-hour laboratory periods.
During the second year the stu-
dent would have three class
hours a week and one three
hour laboratory period.

Major emphasis during the
second year will be on biology.
with advanced material from
chemistry and physics. Topics
such as origin and evolution of
life and of the universe, home.
ostatic mechanisms and ecology
will be emphasized

In the proposal. arproved by
the Sloan Foundation, Davidson
College will add three new fa-
culty members, one each in
biology, chemistry and physics,
and will employ a machinist-
technician to maintain the soph
isticated instrumentation which
will be a part of the educa-
tional program. There will also
be funds fur summer = study

Cop Linker’s Reenforcement Unnamed

Security Officer Sought

An interim committee compos-
ed of administrative figures is
in the process of securing an ad
ditional security officer for the
campus, as a result of a deci-
sion made before Christmas to
stiffen enforcement of the fac-
ulty’s drinking rules.

The committee is made up of
President D. Grier Martin, Dean
of Students Richard C. Burts Jr..
Business Manager and Treasur-
er Robert A. Currie Jr., Assist-
ant Business Manager Robert J.
Stephenson and Director of the

Physical Plant Grover Meetze.

‘We have nobody in sight and
have worked up no_ instruc-
tions,’’ Burts said this week.
However, he conceded that there
probably would be a single em-
ployee, who would work on Fri-
days and Saturdays.

Enforcement of the drinking
rule will not be the new secur-
ity officer's only responsibility,
Burts asserted, though he also
said “I don't want to say for
sure what his responsibilities
will be.’

One possibility of a source
would be Safe, Inc., a Charlotte
investigating service which has
supplied guards for a number
of campus social and athletic
functions.

“But we would probably have
better relations with someone
who is more locally oriented,”
he said.

No directives have been is-
aued yet to the present campus
security officers as to what pol-
icy should be pursued in refer-
ence to the drinking rule.

‘The recipients were picked on
a basis of their ability to con-
ceive original and innovative

their own fundamental prob.

Further considerations were
the degree of commitment to
improve science education, ca.
pacity to carry through plans
and ability to sustain the added
effort after the Sloan support

In its announcement, Dayvid..
son's program was cited as the
only one involving an entirely
new interdisciplinary science
program.

“We think that science itself
will benefit by an increased as-
sociation with the liberalizing
and humanizing forces which

‘Bag’ Law
Conflicts
Unresolved

No plan has been discussed
for changing the faculty regula
tions. to conform with state ‘aws
concerning the possession and
transportation of alcoholic bev
erages, President D. Grier Mar-
tin commented in an interview
Tuesday.

The recent North Carolina law
prohibiting “brown bagging’
has been certified by the Meck
lenburg Superior Court and is in
effect. It prohibits transporta-
tion or possession of liquor ex
cept in the case of transporta
tion to a private home.

The student conduct section
of the faculty regulations states
that a student may possess al-
cohol on the campus if it is in
the locked trunk of his automo-
bile. This is now illegal! accord
ing to the state's brown bagging
law.

“Obviously. students must
obey the state laws or suffer
the consequences.” Martin said.
“The college regulations will not
be changed, probably. no.”

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts remarked that last spring
when the brown bagging law

was first reinterpreted, by the

N. C. Attorney General, the Ex-
ecutive Committee considered
altering the regulations, How.
ever, an injunction was brought
to prevent enforcement of the
law in Mecklenburg County and
the Executive Committee took
no action.
