DR. LINGLE PLANS INTEREST-
ING TRIP.

On June 19 a party of voung men,
mostly Davidson students, led by Dr.
Lingle, will sail from New York for
Southampton, England, for a seventy-
day tour through England, France, and
Ita'y, spending half the time in France,
and the other half divided between Eng-
land and Italy.

The trip will be made across the con-
tinent on bicycles. Ie will be especially
interesting and instructive to the stu-
dents, because of Dr. Lingle’s skill in
modern languages and familiarity with
the historical places visited.

Some of the places to be visited in
England will be London, Gray’s Coun-
try Churchyard, Eton College, and the
Shakespeare country at Stratford on
Avon. Crossing the English Channel to
Normandy, the route lies up the Seine to
Paris, visiting the chateaux and famous
fortresses along the wav; thence to the
Auvergne country of Central France,
called by some writers the most beauti-
ful region on earth. Then passing on
to Italy, the route leads to Genoa, Pisa,
Florence, Rome and Naples.

All together this trip will afford an
oppogtunity for spending as pleasant and
as profitable a summer imaginable.
