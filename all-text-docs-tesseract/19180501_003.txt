ELECTION OF OFFICERS.

Shortly after the battle waged on
Sprunt field last Saturday there was
another one fought at the Philanthropic
Society in the election of officers for the
first three months of next vear. “The
society met at 7:15 and immediately
went into the election of officers.

The mantle of “Woody” Clark fell
on R. D. Hall. May he be as efficient
and as “peppy” an executive as the out-
going president—and we are sure he
will, since he was elected by acclama-
tion. To lead the Junior Society next
year along the flowery path of debating.
1). M. Chalmers was elected, succeeding
C. W. Worth, the present incumbent.
There were several nominations for both

Oration, W.

secretary and treasurer, but the bucky]

men were—for secretary, R. C. Clontz,
and for treasurer, F. L. Knight. W.
M. Currie was elected first critic, and
A. L. Foscue, second critic. For first
supervisor, A. L. Currie was elected.
For second supervisor C. N. Morrison.
There were several aspirants for the
position of janitor, and after a good deal
of voting and counting the secretary an-
nounced that L. L. Wilson was the win-
ner. The Debating Council chosen con-
sists of the. following: 1. G. Lilly, W.
M. Currie and C. W. Worth.

After the supervisor's, secretary's and
treasurer's reports—and several extem
poraneous speeches by “Pebble,” the so
ciety was adjourned by a unanimous vote
of the house.

NEW MEN INITIATED,

One of the most interesting meetings
of the Eumencan Society this year was
held Saturdav. Owing to the amount:
of other business on hand, the regular
program was dispensed with. William
Love read the new constitution of the
society, which has been revised, mod-
ernized and shortened. Then the new
officers for next vear were installed, with
OE. Flinn as president, William Love as
vice-president, J. R. Boulware as secre-
tary, and A, S. Potts as reviewer.

Fou new men were initiated: J. R.
McKenlin. H. H. Massey, S. R. Har-
well and W. [.. Roddey. Harwell and
Roddev made: their first: argumentative
efforts by debating on the question: “Re-
solved, That | am a better man than
vou are.” No points were brought out
on either side. McKeldin and Massey
gave: orations, Massey on the subject,
“My Home Town.” and McKeldin on
Athens, Tenn. Massey informed the
members of the society that he was from
the country, so was ineligible for an ora-
tion on his subject.

MARION BOGGS SPEAKS
AT THE JOINT MEFTING

Marion Boggs. '15, who is now in
Union Seminary, addressed a joint meet-
ing of ‘the Christian Endeavor, Volun-
teer Band, and Ministerial Band, in
Shearer Hall last Sunday evening He
chose the subject “Prayer,” from Jas.
5:13-20. He emphasized the impor-
tance of prayer especially at the present
time. He showed how prayer works
miracles in the cleansing of the human
soul, how it removes all obstacles in
one’s way, and finally, that it increases
faith. Everyone enjoyed the address.
