Compulsory Physical Education Under Attack

SGA Backs Turner. Resolution

AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Is a compulsory physical
education program’ a neces-
sary part of*student life at
Davidson?

Junior senator Jody Turn- -

er does not think so, and
next Monday he will con-
front the Educational ‘Policy
Committee (EPC) with a re-
solution’ backed by the Sen-
ate to abolish the six-term
requirement in P.E.

As an alternative to the
program Turner would like
. to make the Intramural Ath-
-letics Council (IMAC) into
an SGA committee for ‘‘cre-
ating a comprehensive in-
tramural sports program to
satisfy most Davidson stu-
dents."’

The two-year P.E. pro-
gram is standard at a vast
majority of ‘schools across
the nation, including those in
the Southern and Atlantic
Coast Conferences. ©

Reaction to the resolution
in the Athletics department
was varied, Physical educa-
tion instructor Sterling Mar-
tin is practically running the
program on his own right
now as well as spending his
évenings directing intramur-
al sports.

Martin

stated: “‘I'm_ not

totally opposed to the abo- -

lition of the program, but I
think there is still a place
for P.E. on the campus.
“We have to require P.E.
now to get students who
would never voluntarily take
the time to come here for a
little exercise. I would much
rather offer a program that
would induce ‘students to
come on their own, but un-
til we have ‘such a set-up,
the rule holds true.”
(Martin believes the depart-
ment will need a larger staff

Students Uphold

to expand, the P.E. program
into more than it is now, “If
we're going to make P.E.
viable at Davidson, it will
require at least two .more
full-time instructors."

(Martin said that there used
to be a remedial P.E. pro-
gram a few years ago, but
that the idea was discontinu-
ed because the situation be-
came touchy and ‘students
in the group were labelled
‘“‘spastics’’ by the other stu-
dents.

He added: ‘Look, we've
got 40% of the student body
out for varsity sports and
75% involved in intramurals.
In short, we're a jock school.
At the same time 40% of an
average freshman __ class

flunk the simple PT test we
give every year, and three
or four people score zero
on it.’

Director of Athletics and
Physical ‘Education Tom
Scott feels that ‘such a
move would be a mistake
for Davidson College.

‘We say we are a liberal
arts college to prepare stu-

dents for the future, and ~

health seems to me to be a
part of that future. All we
try to do is to give basic in-
struction to students in
carryover sports that they
can use later on in life.’’
Commenting on expanding
the intramural program as
an altérnative to P.E., Scott
said, ‘I don't see how we

can improve the IMAC here.
It's working at its maximum
potential now, and the only
thing. we can do is to add
a few more facilities. Any
one who wants to play an in-
tramural sport can find a
place.”

Scott admitted that the in-
struction in P.E. was_ nat
the best possible because
many of the 11 coaches
now on the staff are wrap-
ped up in their respective
varsity sports and that the
head coaches in basketball
and football do not instruct
any classes at all.

‘He said that it was often
the case for a football coach
to try to coach a tennis class
while the tennis coach was

out on a scouting trip. This
situation turns up jin many
of the sports.

EMAC President Tom Jeter
doubts that .he intramural
program can take the place
of compulsory P-E. ‘I think
80% is a conservative figure
for the number of students
involved in intramurals, but
if you're going to abolish
P.E. there must be some
other alternative program
which the IMAC cannot pre-
sently provide.”’

According to Jeter, ‘‘The
gym is so crowded now that
there is not enough time in
a week for all the teams
to play. We have to work in
teams every spare moment
that the varsity or some
other group is not on the
floor."’

A student referendum
Tuesday upheld the senate’s
appropriation of $1000 for an
appearance of Chicago Se-
ven member Rennie Davis
on the Davidson, Campus next
week. DS

‘A 2/3 vote of the entire
student body was required to
upend the senate’s action in
an election which saw_ 510
students, or 64% of those
voting, support the action
and 284, or 36%, vote not to
approve the appropriation.

a leaflet Monday night which
urged students to vote
against the senate action to
“display our better judg-
ment.”’

* Senior Chip DuRant, who
spearheaded opposition to
the senate appropriation,
said that although some of
those who had worked with

him formulated and distri- -

buited the leaflet, he had no
part in its creation.
When asked about his re-

_ actions to the vote, DuRant

said that, although he was

disappointed, he was’ pleas-

ed that 1/3 of the student
body supported him. DuRant
said that the turnout was
larger than he had expected.

A similar reaction came
from SGA President Danny
Clodfelter, who said, ‘I’m
generally pleased with the
vote, especially in the turn-
out.’

Clodfelter euieea the

clouded by the dual issues of

_ taken, I am not quite clear.

I gather they either sought
a confrontation or they
wished other groups in the
college to assume the re-

‘ sponsibility for enforcing the

present regulations.

“If they wished to seek a
liberalization of the rule or
assume a greater responsi-
bility for student life in the
dorms, there are procedures
for doing this.

‘Up to the time of this ac-
tion things were pretty much
the way the majority of stu-
dents wanted them. Why
they felt it necessary to dis-
favor any responsibility for
these regulations is quite a
mystery.

“The RHC used the tired
old argument about the hy-
pocrisy of having a rule
without rigid enforcement.
Hypocrisy does not trouble
me in most cases — some of
my .best friends are hypo-
crites, including, dare I say
it, some of my _ student
friends. What the future
holds for this issue, only
time will tell.”

Various faculty members
were contacted to get their
reaction on the question of
open dofms. Associate Pro-
fessor of English ‘Anthony S.
Abbott disagreed with the
action taken by the RHC.

_He feels that the RHC should

have worked through the
proper chanzels by bringing
this matter before the Stu-

. dent Life Committee (SLC).

The SLC then could have
brought this matter before
the faculty so that it could
have decided to maintain the
regulations regarding open
dorms or to amend them.

“The present rule should
be . enforced until formal
change takes place, and I
belieye an attempt should be
made to get people to abide
by the present rule,’’ said
Abbott?

“There are channels clear
ly delineated which students
can use. I want to see clear
evidence of how the miajori-
ty of the students feel,’’ he
commented.

“I am agaifist 24-hour
open dorms, and I cite two
major reasons.

“The first one is that the
right of privacy would be
violated, and the second one
is that the girls would be
placed, in a position which
would be unfair,’’ he con-
tinued. According to Abbott,
the pressures on the girl
caused by 24-hour open
dorms would be unnecessary.

In the Spencer Commis-
sion Reports published in

THE DAVIDSONIAN of No- .

vember 7, 1969, one report
read in part: ‘‘As for the
séxual conduct of students

. the Commission is
aware that probably it will
be worse than useless to at-
tempt to apply old standards
to control sexual behavior.

“In all likelihood the stu-
dents will engage in a long
war of attrition, to the de-
triment of everyone, as
they pass’ for freedoms in
line with contemporary mo-
rality.

“While the social lives of
the students are the Col-
lege’s responsibility to °fos-
ter, the sexual lives of the
students are their own re-
sponsibility.”

Abbott was referred to
this passage, and he replied.
“My. position is not incon-
sistent with this. Open dorms
is ‘not only a question of sex-
ual conduct. There are two
points which should be borne
in mind. ,

“The first-is that a dorm
room is like ashome, and
the individual ought to have
the right to use it without
his rights being
on by his roommate’s date.

infringed ‘
. Rowland

Also it is the responsibility
of the college not to place
people in situations of undo

“temptation.”

Assistant professor of Ger-
man Hansford M: Epes Jr.
said ‘‘the RHC , cannot be
clare open dorms. It can
say that it won't enforce cur-
rent rules, and announcing
this would not be much of
a surprise. The action of
the RHC is of monumental
insignificance."

It was recalled by Epes

that a year ago the Student:--

Life Committee of which he
was a member voted to en
dorse open dorms if the re-
sidents wanted it.

The recommendation of
the Student Life Committee
was presented to the faculty
