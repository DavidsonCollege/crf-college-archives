Landis and assistants leaving for West Coast

By MIkE ANDERSON
Editor-in-Chief

A week ago Saturday, ESPN broke a
story that sent shock waves through the David-
son football program:

Head football coach Tim Landis had
been plucked away from the Wildcat pro-
gram by anoffer from
St. Mary’s College of
Moraga, Calif.

‘Landis, who
spent seven years at
the helm for David-
son, leaves behind an
indelible legacy of
accomplishment. He
was the winningest
Wildcat football
coach since Homer
Smith (1965-1969),
and guided Davidson
to its best seasons
ever, in 1998 and
1999.

But the story of
Landis’ tenure was
one of a remarkable
turnaround. The pro-
gram won just 22: Coach Tim Landis
football games in the decade before he as-
sumed the top spot. And though things started
slow, Landis left the program in its best shape
ever.

Davidson won eight games in 1998, for
the first time in 101 years of competition.
And with another eight-win campaign in 1999,
the Wildcats earned their first back-to-back
winning seasons since the 1950s.

Also making the transition to St. Mary’s
will be long-time Wildcat Tripp Merritt and
first-year coach Steve Perry.

Merritt, along-time favorite among play-
ers, has been described as one of the finest
football minds ever to coach at Davidson.
The team’s defensive coordinator and chief
recruiter, Merritt helped develop the Wild-
cats’ nationally-re-
nowned defense.

And though Perry
spent just one sea-
son at Davidson,
the secondary
coach made an im-
mediate impact.
Wildcat defensive
backs picked off 28
passes this season,
including eight by

Ryan Crawford.
“Tt willalways be
a tremendous time
in my life,” said
Landis, reflecting
on his years at
Davidson. “Noone
can ever take away
this Davidson ex-

perience.”

“You always hate to lose good people,”
said Athletic Director Jim Murphy. “Profes-
sionally, we’ ll continue to move onward and
upward. But personally, it’s a big loss.”

Landis, Merritt and Perry will take over
a proud program that has fallen upon hard
times of late. St. Mary’s, a NCAA Division
I-AA partially-funded independent, went just

“Tim Landis took over a program at
Davidson College that was struggling to win
more than a game or two a year and devel-
oped it into an outstanding program with
outstanding athletes,” said St. Mary’s Ath-
letic Director Rick Mazzuto. “We are hoping
he will quickly bring the type of success he
had at Davidson to Saint Mary’s College.”

Landis extended job offers to each of his’

current assistants, but three of them—Al
Logan, Bob Brown, and Brett Hayford—

“I know they’re going to be real good
next year,” said Landis. “A breath of fresh air
is always good. I was just one piece of the
puzzle here, our players know that a lot of our
success has been based upon their abilities.”

“We’re going to miss (Landis) a lot. He
helped to restore credibility to Davidson foot-
ball,” acknowledged Murphy. “But I’m not
worried whatsoever about the future of the
Davidson football program.”

Many of the Wildcats’ senior leaders.
have sprung into action at the recent an-

elected to stay at nouncement. The team has

“Continuity is always good,” said Landis.
“IT would emphasize continuity and un-

Murphy expects to consider between 50
and 75 candidates for the position, with expe-
rience levels ranging from Division III to the

NFL. The Athletic Department reportedly .

received a phone call from NFL legend Mike
Ditka, who called to pitch a former assistant
from his days with the New Orleans Saints.

Landis’ successor will take over a pro-
gram at its’ peak, with a rising senior class
considered perhaps the finest in Wildcat his-
tory.

NCAA guidelines, we
(players) will do as much recruiting as we
can,” said Jon DeBord.

Many of the players see the potential
adversity as an opportunity for growth. “The
way we reactis going to show the character of
our team,” said Brian Bokor.

The squad is just weeks away from spring
practices, but no timeline’has been set for the
hiring of a coach.

“We just want somebody in there,” said
Crawford. “Before spring ball would be
ideal.”

Hockey falls in second
round of playoffs

The Davidson roller-hockey team faced
off against.the Hellfish on Thursday night in
the first-round playoff action.

The Wildcats entered the game without
two key players, Brad Stevinson and Ryan
Auster. Stevinson was unable to play due to
illness and Auster was sidelined by an injured
knee.

Playing with"only one substitute, each
player was forced to spend much more time
on the surface and play positions that they
may not have played before. In the absence
of Auster, the entire team stepped up offen-
sively, getting goals from everyone.

Evan McCormick fired home a shot to
give the Wildcats an early lead. Ron Olson
jammed in a rebound to add an insurance goal
for Davidson. Bryan Stevinson scored his
first goal of the season on a wrist shot from
the right circle.

The Hellfish then began to take control
of the game, taking advantage of a somewhat
tired Davidson team. Mark Hymerling
brought the Wildcats closer as he took advan-

tage of a rebound.

Trailing late in the game, McCormick
fired in two goals to tie the game and send it
to overtime.

Early in overtime, McCormick fired a
slapshot from the left circle. Hymerling,
standing in front of the net got his stick on the
puck to deflect it through the Hellfish
goaltender. With the victory, the Wildcats
moved on to face UNCC in the semi-finals.

In the semi-final game, the Wildcats
jumped out to an early lead on goals by
McCormick, Dave Smith, and Hymerling.
UNCC then began to pick up their play,
cutting the lead to one.

The Wildcats, playing again without
Auster, built their lead up again on a goal by
Olson. McCormick then scored on a brilliant
rush up the floor, burying a wrist shot with a
UNCC player draped across his back.

The lead held up until late in the third
period, thanks to several key saves by Heit,
when the depth of the UNCC team took over,
they used three full lines while the Wildcats
seemed to get tired.
