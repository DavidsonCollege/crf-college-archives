Abakanowicz exhibit que

The Van Every Gallery opened last
Thursday evening with an exhibit of
Magdalena Abakanowicz’s
sculptures of the last ten
years. “Her sculptures are
an extension of our own
collection of prime examples
to study in person,” said Brad
Thomas, Davidson’s gallery
director. An essential part of
studying her works in person,
involves understanding
the relationship between
Abakanowicz’s personal life
and her work.

Joseph Antenucci
Becherer, a close friend of
Abakanowicz and the first
Director and Curator of
the Sculpture Program at
Frederik Meijer Gardens
and Sculpture Park in Grand
Rapids, Michigan, lectured
in the Semans Auditorium
on Thursday evening.

Becherer has organized
four _—_ exhibitions with
Abakanowicz and __ has
witnessed her journey as an
artist. He offered a personal
glimpse into the life of
Magdalena Abakanowicz.

Abakanowicz was born
in 1930 in Falenty, Poland
to an aristocratic family.
At age nine, however, her
life entered into a period
of turmoil with the Nazi
invasion. Her family lost
their high social standing
and was forced to move to
Warsaw, where they were
outsiders isolated from the rest of the world.
Here, the young Abakanowicz witnessed the
atrocities of war. Her mother lost an arm by
Nazi gunfire, and Abakanowicz watched in
horror as she observed individuals in her new

At the same time, she searched for
a vocabulary and materials for her own
art work and found it in what Becherer
referred to as the “found object plus plus.”
Abakanowicz began by salvaging fibers in
the °50s and ’60s, as other materials during

ve

the post WWII Soviet era were scarce.
Becherer’s “plus, plus” refers to
Abakanowicz’s complete transformation of
the fibers, pulling them part, cleaning them
and weaving them back together. Her focus

community turn violently against each other.

Though it was hard to receive a formal
education during this period, Abakanowicz
studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ponza,
Poland.

Because she was a woman interested in
expressive and abstract work, Abakanowicz
became an outsider once again, though this
time it was within the art world. After she
finished her education, Abakanowicz took
a job at a silk factory where she painted
scarves.

was on the surface of the sculpture, the
physical presence of the work and its ability
to command space.

These pieces, which are referred to as
“Abakans,” reflect Abakanowicz’s desire
to command space and express practicality.
During her early career, she lived in a very
small space. and these weavings could be
folded easily and stored in her living quarters.
In the 1960s, Abakanowicz received the
Grand Prix of Sao Paolo Biennial award,
which gave her international fame and forced
her work into a larger artistic community.

In the second phase of her work,
Abakanowicz embraced the figure and hired
her first human model. In order to express the
relationship between artist and model, she
added resin and plaster to the early style of
the Abakans.

“My work comes from the experience
of crowds, injustice and aggression,”
Abakanowicz said of her figurative work. “I
feel an affinity for art when it was made a
form of existence, like when shamans worked

in the territory between men and unknown
powers [...] I try to bewitch the crowd.”

“Art is a confession, a confrontation, a
warning,” she continued. “The consciousness
that crowds are like a brainless organism that
destroys or worships on command. The crowd
that follows leaders who gain the obedience
of their nation by imposing on them deceitful
slogans.”

Her works in the Davidson exhibition
deal with the issues that surround a crowd
mentality. The often headless and armless
individuals suggest anonymity of the

group

individual but ultimately relate back to
humanity as a whole.

Her group pieces, like “Bambini,” also
act as a form of installation art as their frontal
qualities are strengthened when shown
together as a group. Several of the pieces
also deal with the idea of
overpowering obstacles
and force the viewer to
contemplate his or her
place in society. The backs
of her works, nevertheless,
are aS important as the
fronts, and their shell-like
quality suggests coffin.

Overall, the exhibit
needs to be looked at in
the round, as the backs
of the pieces are just as
intriguing as the fronts.
The focus on textures

and surfaces remains
paramount from all
perspectives.

As Becherer _ said,
Abakanowicz wants the
viewer to experience the
entire work, circling front
and back. Abakanowicz’s

works are intended to
ask questions of the
viewer. The catalog

for this exhibition is
an invaluable guide in
shaping how one can
approach the exhibition
in order to embrace the
confrontations.

“The metaphoric
language of art — can
it influence others?”
Becherer asked.
