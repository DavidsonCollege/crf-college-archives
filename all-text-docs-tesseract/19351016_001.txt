Alumni Begin Work
On Centennial Gift

Church, Field House, Library Are

In reporting the progress of the Alum-
ni Association on their contemplated Cen-
tennial Gift, Grier Martin, secretary of
the organization, said this week that the
Church and the Field House were leading
the voting with the Library, Social Cen-
ter, and Infirmary following. He also an-
nounced that almost $400 had been re-
ceived in contributions from the alumni.

Although a full and detailed report on
the voting is not available at the pres-
ent time, Martin said that there would
be a complete report issued at an early
date.

The have contributed
which range in size from $1.00 to $50.00.
The the alumni has been
as strong as was expected at this time.
It was explained that the main drive of
the campaign for funds will be made
in the spring of '36 and the spring of °37.
To further this plan the Association has
prepared a very attractive circular which
it intends to send to every alumnus. This
circular contains a discussion of the Cen-
tennial Gift plan and lists the causes for
which the alumni may vote. There are six
major causes from which the alumni are
to choose their gift. The cause which
receives the most votes will be awarded
all of the money contributed for the gift.

In an effort to make the gift one of
the entire alumni the following motto
has been adopted: “It's Not the Size of
the Gift that Counts—It’s the Giving!”

Nothing better illustrates the true loy-
alty of the Davidson Alumni than a let-
ter received by the Secretary of the As-
sociation from a member of the Class of
'73. This alumnus wrote that he was an
old, retired minister and paralyzed and
was not able to contribute to the gift
fund at the present time, but if he re-
ceived any money for Christmas he would
send that in as his contribution. ‘That's
the type spirit that marks a
Davidson man,” Martin commented.

The causes for which the contributions
are made are: first, an alumni scholar-
ship system. This would establish regional

COLLEGE REQUESTS
FANS TO HELP
KEEP TRADITION

“It is traditional on the Davidson
campus that we have no drinking.
Our guests at football games are
particularly to refrain
from violating in this important mat-
ter the wishes of Trustees, Faculty,
students, and friends of the College.”’

With this announcement Davidson
College startled the eight thousand
fans who filled her stadium for the
South Carolina game Saturday, and
at the same time set a precedent
which, many believe, will be fol-
lowed by
throughout the country.

The notice comes only as the re-

requested

sult of long and careful considera-
tion and conferences with students
and faculty. Mr. F. L. Jackson, the
college treasurer, read the request
in chapel Saturday morning, stating
that it was with a great deal of hes-
itation that he brought the subject
up and that he wished to obtain
itudent opinion. It received the unan-
imous endorsement of the student
body.

“The Audubon Society exists for one
purpose only, and that is to protect birds
and wild life,” stated Mr. Alexander
Sprunt in his illustrative lecture Monday
night.

Mr. Sprunt took as his topic “The
Why and How of Bird Protection,”
stating a fact and making a prophecy in
regard to the safety of birds. Education
and conservation are the legs on which
the Audubon society stands.

“Birds are put here to do away with
insects, rodents, and fish.” ‘We are here
because birds are here. America has at
last awakened, and is beginning to pro-
tect feathered inhabitants.

At one time birds were killed for their
plumage. Today this is prohibited by
Federal Law and is backed not only by
them but

STRIKER PURLOIN
LAST WEEK’S PAPER

The failure of THE DAVIDSON..,
IAN to appear last week was due to
the fact that the copy for the paper
did not reach the establishment of
the Queen City Printing Company
in Charlotte, printers for the college
weekly.

The copy left Davidson, according
to schedule, on a midnight bus, and °
arrived the bus in
Charlotte some thirty minutes later.
There a man who claimed to bee"
of the
company was waiting to receive it.
After taking the copy, this man
disappeared, and with him the news
of the week. While the thief’s iden-
tity is not known, the opinion is
held by members of THE DAVID-
SONIAN staff that he participated in

strike,

at terminal

representative publishing

last spring’s printers’ and
that his action was the outgrowth of
ill feeling caused at the time.

Every precaution will be taken in
the future to prevent a recurrence of
this loss, according to those in re-

sponsible positions.
