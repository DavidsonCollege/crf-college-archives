the college received 293 entries.
The entire Davidson English fac-
ulty read these entries and then
selected 45 for further consider-
ation.

A committee consisting of
Comwell, Dr. Randy Nelson, Dr.
Gill Holland, and Dr. Cynthia
Lewis re-read the 45 selected en-
tries, and narrowed the number
down to ten finalists. The ten stu-
dents were then invitedto Davidson
for interviews and a special lun-
cheon with Cormmwell held in their
honor.

At the luncheon, Cornwell
announced Sean McGrew of Char-
lotte as the first recipient of the
honorable scholarship. She con-
tinued by expressing her pleasure
at the excellent quality of every
entry. Then, the surprise came.

Because she was so impressed
with the quality of writing,
Comwell decided to establish an-
other scholarship. The Kay

Scarpetta Award for Excellence in
Scientific Writing named for amain
character in Cornwell’s books is
valued at $7,500 and is renewable

for four years.

Cornwell presented the schol-
arship which is awarded for writ-
ing that is both scientifically ori-
ented and technically based to Chad
Fogleman of Graham, NC.

In the course of her comments
at the luncheon Cornwell ap-
plauded all of the students and
continued by saying that they
would always be a permanent part
of her Davidson family, and that
she would always be available to
help them pursue their writing in-
terests.

Lottery Leaves Many Waiting

By Jason Dennis

The residential lottery finally
ended, and for many, the stress has
ended. For almost 90 men and
women, however, the struggle to
find a place to live is not over.

The almost 60 women with-
out secured rooms will find out
text Tuesday night at 5 p.m. when
the Residence Life Office hosts a
mini-lottery for the women who

had tentatively signed up for Irwin
and those on the waiting list. They
will choose between 2nd Watts
and 1st Irwin.

Originally, first Irwin was nei-
ther a men’s or women’s hall, but
left open to be determined by the
number of people on each waiting
list. Second Watts was slated to be

- amen’s hall, but the unexpectedly

high number of women left with-

Except for a quick trip to the
Post Office or the bank, Davidson
Collegestudentsrarely spendmuch
time in the town of Davidson. And
though students leave after four
years, much of the town has been
the same for decades.

Things in this unique town do
not disappear quickly, but often

~ linger and add to the rich tradition

which the town already holds. Take
a stroll on a sunny day and here's
what you might find.

Our first stop on Main Street
is Tom Clark’s Museum and Shop.
Clark, a resident of Davidson and
a professor of Religion, Art, and
Theology at the college for thirty
years, left teaching in 1988 to de-

vote all of his time to his sculpting.
Thousands of gnome-like figures
each with its own personality and
history adom the wooden shelves
and glass cases of the store which

Clark opened nearly three years

ago.

to pull it from the men’s lottery.
There are some people not in-
cluded in this mini-lottery that
might resent this sudden opening
of a highly sought after dorm to
wait-listed women. Those who
may be upset are women who got
rooms down the hill but would
prefer to be in Watts, since they

Davidson graduate, is the author of
award-winning mystery novels and

Mrs. Gardner Roller Ligo,
Merit Scholarship Coordinator,
stated of the scholarship: “[These
awards] are perfect examples of
Davidson’s emerging philosophy
of merit scholarship aid. These
scholarships recognize and award
special talent and ability and then
nurture that talent.”

Students
Want to Know

Why the
Court Stinks

By Mandy Curtis

“Maintaining” Patterson
Court, literally and symbolically,
is a concern.of students, faculty,
and staff at Davidson. Recently,
the concern has been directed to
sewage. The Environmental Ac-
tion Committee, alarmed by an
odor and rumors of leaking sew-
age pipes, has raised questions
about Patterson Court’s sewage
system. Students want to know
what the foul smell is and where it
is coming from.

According to Maintenance
Supervisor Jerry Archer, however
bad the court may smell, there is
nothing unusual happening. He
said that there has been a history of
sewage overflow from one par-
ticular man-hole on the court.
However, to his knowledge, this
has not happened in over a year.

The specific man-hole in ques-
tion is the one between Warner
Hall and Connor. There, the man-
hole has overflowed with sewage
in years past. Archer stated that
