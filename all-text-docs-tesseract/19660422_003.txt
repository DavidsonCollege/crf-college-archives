‘HUNGRY

d’ OPENS

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Comedian To Headline
Union Entertainment

By BEN LAHEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Union launches a new con-
cept in student entertainment on
Monday with comedian Fred
Smoot and Charlotte's Bill Mc-
Entire Combo performing at the
Hungry d.

Union President Peter Parrott
commented this week on C.
Shaw Smith's dream-child, ‘'For

a long time it has been felt that
Davidson and the Charlotte area
have been importantly Jacking
in the relaxed atmosphere of a
night club that offers quality en-
tertainment at a reasonable
price.

“This is what we hope to
bring to Davidson this week
(Monday, Wednesday, Thursday
and Saturday) at the Hungry
d.”

One of the least-used, but most
potentially useful, departments
among those provided by the
college is the Audio-Visual Serv-
ice.

Located in the north basement
of Chambers, the department
has various types of projectors,
tapes, recordings, and copying
machines which are available to
faculty members and students.

According to Mrs. Annamarie
Burts, coordinator of the serv-
ice, too few people at Davidson
realize the importance of the ef-
fective use of these facilties.
Mrs. Burts estimated that only
fifty percent of the faculty use
the service to any great extent.
Those who do, however, are
highly satisfied with the results.

At its beginning in 1962, the
purpose of the service was to
remove from the faculty the
worry and responsibility of or-
dering and maintaining films,
projectors, and other teaching
aids. The department has been
expanded to fill several other
needs.

The service has a large enough
variety of equipment to cover
almost any need in the audio-
visual area. Included are five
different types of projectors,
ranging from ordinary 16mm to
opaque and overhead types.

Also, there are almost 150
films and filmstrips in its libra-
ry, and over 3,000 slides. Along
with this there is equipment to
make transparencies suitable for
projection. These can duplicate
original drawings, illustrations
from books, documents, and oth-
er difficult to copy articles.

The audio portion of the serv-
ice is equally well-equipped.
There are record players, tape
recorders, and one special turn-
table which transfers directly
from disc recordings to tape.

Contained_in the department
library are a great number of
recordings on subjects varying
from Supreme Court cases to
readings from Shakespeare and
American folk music.

All available both to students
and faculty members through

taped copies of the master re-

frequently used are placed in
the language lab for conven-
lence.

This equipment can be used
effectively in many ways. Math
professor J. T. Kimbrough has
put a math course into trans-
parencies. History courses use
slides and filmstrips, while both
English and foreign language
departments use tape record-
ings.

The equipment is also avail-
able to students for such uses as

Journalist
At YMCA

As part of the YMCA forums
for this year, William Worthy
Jr. will make two appearances
on the campus Monday. He will
speak to the student body at the
morning assembly, followed by
a coffee hour at the Union. Then
he will conclude his visit with
another talk at 3 p.m. in the
Morrison Room.

Worthy could well be classi-
fied as a ‘‘trouble shooter’’. In
1956 he was deported from the
Union of South Africa where he
had gone as a correspondent for
the Baltimore Afro-American
and CBS News.

In 1957 he took an “unauthor-
ized” six-weeks trip to China.
His passport was taken away by
the Department of State and
never renewed. In 1960-1961 he
took four fact-finding trips to
Cuba, the fourth in spite of a
U. S. ban on travel to that coun-
try.

In 1960 on assignment for
Time. Worthy was 4 member of
the reporting and camera team
that produced the documentary
“Yanki No!’’ which was televis-
ed via the ABC network.

In 1964-1965 he went on elev-
en-month trip to Asia and Eu-
rope, including North Viet Nam,

term papers, seminar reports,
and other presentations which
require an audio-visual aid.

The service is under the con-
trol of the Audio-Visual Com-
mittee, whose chairman is Dr.
Hopkins. Mrs. Burts hopes that
an increase in the use of the de-
partment will cause an increase
in the budget, to allow more im-
provement.

At present, the department is
open only from 9 to 12 daily,
but hopfully this will be expand-
ed in the future. There may also
be a provision for increased stu-

Bates College and studied jour-

He has traveled around the globe
three times, and he has visited
forty-six countries while on as-
signments. ;

Worthy, a Negro, has certain-
ly made himself known. On May
2, 1964, the CBS-TV Network
program ‘'The Defenders” dram-
atized the right-to-travel and
freedom-of-the-press issues rais-
ed by his individualism under
the title ‘“Yankee Come Home.”

As 1965-66 publicity chairman
for the YMCA, Buck Lawrimore
commented on the coming speak-
er, “Worthy is a free-lance news-
paperman, writing primarily for
the Baltimore Afro-American.
He is an individualist, and a
staunch advocate of the right
to travel and freedom of the
press. Worthy will speak about
some aspect of the problems of
modern man.

“Judging from his credentials,
it appears that he will be able
to give first-hand impressions
of situations in prominent trou-
ble-spots in the world today, es-
pecially Cuba and Southeast
Asia.”

For those who wish, supper
will be served from either. a din-
ner or a sandwich menu from 7
to 8:15, with soft drinks and cof-
fee being served all evening.
The shows will be in the Morri-
son Room which Parrott prom-
ises ‘‘will not be recognizable.’’

Advance reservations can be
made at the Union desk, but are
not necessary. Reserved or at
the door, tickets will be one dol-
lar.

Special permission has been
given to Queens girls so that
they might attend the Thursday
performances. Freshmen will be
allowed out of closed study, and
all girls will have an 11:30 cur-
few.

The Union is sponsoring a spe-

for film showings.

One difficulty in this expanded
use is finding materials on the
Davidson level. But increased
efforts by the department. and
organizations such as the Pied-
mont University Center, (of
which Davidson is one of the

fourteen member schools),

should help to fill this need.

The lectureship is part of a
financial drive by the Betas
which also includes renovating
their chapter house.

Beta Arch McCallum com-
mented that the speakers would
be chosen ‘‘for the edification

Present intentions ate for these
speakers to have: at least one
private. symposium with the
chapter and at least one ad-
dress open to the public.

“The proposed program,” he
continued, ‘'will seek to add to
the liberal education through vis-

ous persuasions, in fields rang-
ing from religion to politics to

The money raised by the Betas

tablish an endowed lectureship
on campus, according to Beta!
president David Meschan.

The Bitter End Singers will
display their new Dixieland-
Rock Folk sound on Concert
Weekend, Saturday evening May
7. Their varied show consists of
songs ranging from ‘The Joker"
to “Basin Street Blues” inter-
spersed with comedy spots.

Vince Foster, the Social Chair-
man, realizing that this would
be a big weekend off campus,
said that this show would prob-
able be the best of our three
concerts and he hoped that many
students will stay on campus.

The Bitter End Singers will
perform in front of Chambers,
if weather permits, at 10 p.m.,
after the major drama produc-
tion. At midnight. the Union will
sponsor an informal get-togeth-
er with the singers and all who
want to meet them after the
show.

Foster said that at the Block
Booking Conference in Raleigh
last February this group was
the biggest hit of 15 others. They
were booked for 25 shows imme-
ditely after the conference. In
the last month they have ap-
peared about 29 times in North
Carolina and Virginia.

The Bitter End Singers have
the same manager as the Seren-
dipity Singers and the Women-
folk. All three groups had their
start at his Bitter End night-
club in New York City.

The Bitter End Singers have
twice been asked to the White
House by President Johnson. Of
special appeal is their animated
atmosphere, consisting of effec-
tive backgrounding, vocal gim-
mickry and slick harmonics.

They have recently appeared
