the Southern confer-
ernee tournament for

time it is read the semi-

and possibly the final
fracas, too. In light of

Suffice it to say that

the powers that be By JACK HAZARD
were friendly to old
DD. (. when they dealt the pairings for the affair. However,

inany Wildeat supporters and the team itself looked forward
to another erack at Coy Carson and company, a very unlikely
feat since the White Phantoms are bracketed with N.C. State,
the top-heavy favorite to repeat as champs for the third year
in a row.

Coach Norman Shepard has gone a long sway dhis season
in developing a squad which could have a strong argument in
claiming the title of Davidson's outstanding all-time basket-
hall team. Of course there are duany who will be all over us
for making such a statement. They will immediately point to
the 1942 and 1943 teams which boasted the great. Tommy
Peters. Not having seen either one of these teams in actiuy
we may not be a qualified judge. But our argument is that
Tommy Peters must have been some ball player to be rated
Mike Williams. The well-
rounded squad which ‘‘the Brain” has tutored this season has

far above either Buddy Cheek or

not produced any one player which outshines the rest, Besides
the aforementioned two, who have served as ¢o-eaptains for
the second year, are joined by Whit Cobb to form a trio
Which any coach would want.

Cobb’s brilliance as a floorman cannot be disputed by any-
one who has seen him play. Ilis set shot from the outer court
is one of the surest we've seen, Whit's seleetion by the Big
ive mentors for a second team berth on the All-State five
bears out any praise given him, ;

In plugging this vear’s squad as an all-time great we may
point to the calibre of competition which the postwar cage
