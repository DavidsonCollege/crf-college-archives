EUMENEANS SPEAK ON OPEN
SHOP PRACTICABILITY

The meeting of the Eu Society last
Thursday night was short but interest-
ing. The timely subject, Resolved, That
the closed shop is justifiable, was de-
bated in an excellent manner. Mce-
Cutchen, Beers, and Moss, H. O., upheld
the affirmative, while Henry Morris,
Moffett, and Cunningham, ably defended
the negative. The main arguments cen-
tered around the three outstanding
issues: Will closed shops work too
great a monopoly in industry, will they
cause the unions to restrict membership,
and will,;they be justifiable for moral,
financial and other reasons. The speak-
ers on each side rendered ‘strong argu-
ments pro and con which added a great
deal of interest to the program. The
judges rendered their decision two to
one in favor of the negative. The house,
voting upon the merits of the question,
decided also in favor of the negative.

R. A. M. Martin gave a choice selection
for dgclamation. His good delivery and
careful enunciation foretell an able and
ardent speaker for the Eu Society, An-
other feature of the program for ihe
evening was an oratfon on “The Creat-
est Thing in the World,” given by
Sharpe. This was a well thougit out
speech and was delivered in a very force-
ful manner,

METROPHILIANS HAVE THEIR
REGULAR WEEKLY MEETING

The Metrophilians in a hard-fought
debate last Thursday evening decided
that the closed shop is not justifiable,
and that in its present form it should be
prohibited. W. P. Kimzey and’ F, C
Thames, of the negative, won over W, k.
McCain and T. A. Lacy by a two to ene
vote.

The program was short, consisting of
the debate and current events by A. C.
Ray, the latter” speaker, who . brought
attention to bear upon every event of
interest since the meeting of March 23%
He elucidated at length on the recent
battle with the “Catawbians,” and wound
up his speech with a digested summary
of Junior Speaking.

Several important business matters
concerning graduation from the society
were brought up. The constitution com-
mittee then presented-the new constitu-
tion in mimeographed form. After it
hes been adopted with all amendments
and reservations, it will be bound in
booklet» form and copies will be sent

PHI MEMBERS DISCUSS THE
ADVANTAGE OF CLOSED SHOP

The Philanthropic Literary Society on
- last Thursday night had an interesting
and snappy program. The question for
debate was, Resolved, That the closed
“shop in industry is justifiable. The de-
= bate was full of pep from start to finish:
~ A. V. Gibson and F, S. Johnston were the
|..champions of the cause, while H. K.
> Russell and W. P. Brown Were the ag-
—-gressors. es :
In an oration J. I. Knight took the

word “Jew” and portrayed the signifi-
cance and future of the race in a man-
ner which would have greatly surprised
the prophets of old. C. W. Robinson
spoke on the baseball game which had
been played Thursday afternoon. His
speech was humorous and interesting
throughout. The program was fully up
to the usual standard.
D.
DEBATE OF THE PANDEINICS
FILLED WITH ENTHUSIASM

The Pandeinics held a typically live
and interesting meeting on March 25.
The usual order of program was ob-
served except for the fact that there
were two declamations delivered.

The query for debate was, Resolved,
That the closed shop in industry is justi-
fiable. The affirmative was strongly up-
held by C. F. Wildman and Gray, and
they were opposed by Young and Mc-
Laughlin. The house rendered its de-
cision in favor of the affirmative.

The gentlemen on for declamation
were Oecland and Gibbs. Ocland gave
the familiar piece of the Black Horse and
His Rider, while Gibbs rendered a less
familiar, but none-the-less interesting
and patriotic declamation.

The regular critic being absent, T. M.
Lowry filled the post with his usual effi-
ciency,

The next meeting of the society will
be a joint one. with the Eumeneans, iu
which there will be an inter-society de-
bate and program.

OLD AND NEW DAVIDSONIAN
STAFFS BANQUET TOGETHER

The old and new staffs of the David-
sonian  banqueted togethers at Mrs.

Long’s last Tuesday night to celebrate!

the inauguration of the new administra-
tion, Following the time-honored David-
Sonian tradition, the “gustatory and
gastronomic” element was made the
chief feature of the occasion, and figured
largely in all that was said and done,

Several of the members discovered
rare abilities along this line. Bill
Cooper's joke is acknowledged by all to
be in a class all its own. Mule Currie’s
satire in making out the-last will and
testament could not have shown itself
to better advantage. J. C. Wool rose
to the occasion and told a joke that
actually had some connection with what
he wished to say, Jim Sprunt, however,
should surely hold the honors of the
cvening, because in his own line he show-
ed himself a consummate artist. %

Mack Richards, early in the evening,
sounded the note of nearly all the retir-
ing members when he solemnly assured
the new men that their woes were come
upon them, Then the heads of each of
the old departments arose in his turn,
and bemoaned the hard, hard lot of those
who worked in the Business, or the
Circulation, or the Managing, or the
Alumni, or any of the other Departments,
and each concluded his remarks by tell-
ing of the joy he took in passing on his
work to his successor, The new men
were not to be discouraged, however,
and responded « enthusiasticaly to the
challenge thus placed upon them.

The faculty representative of the even-
ing was Mr. Jackson, and at the conclu-
sion of the festivities he rose and sketch-
ed the history and phenomenal growth of
the Davidsonian, describing the large
place it had come to occupy in the work
of the college. He concluded by sketch-
ing several plans on foot for the coming
year by which the Davidsonian hopes to
serve the college even better than in the
past.

sassin’s Alley. He rolled around his
post at first like a well oiled lawn mow-
er, cutting off base hits. He handled
17 chances in the field in a faultless man-
ner and made several sensational plays
that would look good in the big time
show. In the third, with the bases as
full as a new arrival in Cuba, Dennis
flogged a dirter ten feet to the right of
Crawford. Pat threw himself at the
ball, knocked it down and tossed the
apple to Boushee. At bat he strolled on
tour wide ones once, drove out a double
and a single and scored two runs.

Trinity Game.

In a game that developed a ragged
edge after the fourth inning, Trinity
casily defeated Davidson before a small
crowd in Winston-Salem Saturday. It
was the fifth consecutive victory for the
lads from Durham, and it was made pos-
sible by the loose fielding of the Wild-
cats and the heavy stick work of Trinity,
every man on th® Methodist team con-
necting for at least one hit.

Sorrells was on the hill for the Red and
Black and with anything like decent sup-
pert would have turned in a very credit-
able game. Many of the Trinity hits
were chances that the Davidson infield-
ers should have handled. Lefty Simp-
son did the mound duty for Trinity and
turned in a good game. :

The Wildcats were handicapped by be-
ing rushed into the game without suffi-
cient warming-up after a hard trip. They
arrived in the Tobacco City at three
o’clock and the game started at three-
thirty. The team was not in condition
and the result does not indicate the true
strength of the team.

ATHLETIC NEWS

Famous Wildcat Athletes

HUGH MORTON GREY
D** Football. D***Track

In the front rank of Davidson football
and track stars is “Wooly” Grey, of the
class of 18. After coaching two years
at Bailey Military Academy he returned
to Davidson as football mentor and now
holds the position of Head Coach at_his
Alma Mater.

Playing for three years on the famous
Wildcat teams which held Georgia Tech
to 9:0, 21-7, and 32-10 scores, he gained
a reputation throughout the South as
cne of the greatest guards in the game,
winning an All-Southern berth, and be-
ing mentioned for All-American honors
in’ 1917. The Washington Times, com-
menting on the fact that the Wildcats
were the only team to score on Georgia
Tech, the strongest team in the country,
says: “Three players stand out in little
Davidson’s wonderfully successful cam-
paign on the 1917 gridiron, “Buck”
Flowers, George King and Hugh
“Wooly” Grey who plays offensive
guard and defensive center. Grey is
21 years old, five feet nine inches in
height and weighs 183 pounds, being the
biggest player on the eleven and the
cnly third year man in uniform. But
Grey is fast, being a 103-5 seconds man
on the track. He is also an exceptional-
ly good punter, and his ruggedness keeps
him always in the line-up.” Wooly end-
ed his gridiron career in a blaze of glory
in the Turkey Day fracas with Clemson
which Davidson won. 2t-o, Playing a
great game in the line he grabbed up a
Tiger fumble and raced 15 yards to a
touchdown,

“Wooly” represented the Wildcat
track teams for four years in the weight
events, hurling the discus and putting
the shot. In six meets he made the
enviable record of five first places and
one second in both the discus and the
shot and holds the college record in
both events.

students, and almost any clear afternoon
a large number may be seen engaging in
this sport. Renewed interest has been
manifested, probably more than in any
previous year, and it looks as if golf is
rapidly advancing to a first place among
sports at Davidson.

Numerous improvementts have been
made, and the Golf Club has arranged
to keep'the course in good condition all
Spring.

The spring tournament is to be held
at an early date, and those interested
are expected to participate. The pre-
liminaries are being played this week to
classify the contestants into one of the
three flights. The four highest in the
first flight will be chosen to represent
the college in the intercollegiate tourna-
ment to be held sometime during May.

R. O. T. C. NOTES.

Major Hearn, assisted by the line of-
ficers and cadet officers, has nearly com-
pleted his preparations for the sham
battles that will be fought soon.

On April 20th, Company A will defend
Cemetery Ridge and the other- three
companies making up a battalion will
attack. On the three following Thurs-
days the Ridge will be defended by the
three other companies in turn, and the
battalion made up of the other three
companies will attack. :

As the battles will take up two periods
on Thursday, drill will be omitted on
the following Friday and Saturday of
each week in which the battles will be
fought. ‘

The Juniors who have been studying
the taking down and assembling of}
machine guns have completed this work.
They are now studying the process of
indirect fire, that is, firing at objects
that are not visible.

The next rifle match which will be
fired Saturday, will be with Mississippi
A. and M. Mississippi is reported to
have a good team and will probably give
the Davidson men a good run for their
money.
