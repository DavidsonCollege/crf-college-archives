Band Concert Features
Student Arrangements

Two Davidson students displayed
their talents at musical arrange-
ments last Friday night at the band
concert.

Grier Williams was soloist in his
own arrangement of Hayden's
Trumpet Concerto, and John Shan-
own arrangement of Haydn's
Canzon: Teast een Meskin was
played.

Both men are music majors here
at Davidson and plan to do grad-
uate work in music after grad-
uation. Williams, a senior, is vice-
president of the band and plays
trumpet in both the band and the
brass ° ensemble.

Shannon, a junior, plays the oboe
and organ. While at Duke last
semester he took a course in Rena-
issance music which helped him
to make the arrangement of
Obrecht’s work. °

The main problem faced by the
arranger is that of interpretation.
Having only the original score, he
must try to make the piece sound
as the composer would have writ-
ten it for modern band instruments.
Frequently problems arise from

instruments.

Williams’ arrangement of the
third movement of Haydn's con-
certo came about because of a rel-
ative lack of music written for
trumpet and band. Nineteenth cen-
tury trumpet virtuoso solos were
available, but they were not well-
suited for the band program.

The Haydn concerto was origin-
ally written for trumpet and or-
chestra and was adapted by Wil-
liams for wind instruments. It was
played on the band tour and also
on a broadcast.

Instrumental music was rare be-
fore the Renaissance; most music
was written only for voice. The
piece that Shannon arranged was
written simply “for instruments”
without orchestration. Shannon ar-
ranged it for modern wind instru-
ments,

The Canzon has also been ar-
ranged for chamber music and will
be presented at the chamber music
program Monday night in the Col-
lege Union ballroom. It should be
interesting to compare this arrange-
ment with Shannon's arrangement

adapting light string music to band| for band.

Pastor Sends Davidson
Woodrow Wilson Relics /To Speak on Wirt

Dr, James H. Taylor, pastor at
Central Presbyterian Church, in
Washington, D. C. has forwarded
to the Davidson College Library
a number of interesting articles
concerning Mr. Woodrow Wilson,
Davidson's most distinguished
alumnus. ;

The material consists of a num-
ber of cards addressed to Dr. Tay-
lor’s church which came with flow-
ers which the Wilsons sent to the
church each Sunday. The flowers
were from the White House gar-
dens. The only name on the cards
is Mrs. Woodrow Wilson’s, the
others had only, “The President,”
engraved on them.

ment services of Columbia The-
ological Seminary in Decatur, Geor-
gia.

Another interesting item is aj:

dent's pew. This hymnal was for
use of Mr. Wilson’s guests when
they sat in the pew with him. His
own hymnbook was given to the
Historical Foundation at Montreat.
The book is “The New Laudes
Domini,” with responsive readings;
It was not, generally used by the
President.

assorted material concerning Wood-
row Wilson. The first contains Sun-

Grams in which the service was
dedicated to President Woodrow
Wilson. Others contain: an address
at the tomb of Wilson on Arm-

istice Day, 1934, by Dr. Taylor;|"

Davidson Makes Booklet
On Anniversary Of ’28

The 25th anniversary of the Class
of 1928 will be celebrated this
commencement. It has turned out
to be a class of many distinctions
and the “old boys” are planning to
whoop it up at the end of May.
Professor Chalmers Davidson is
the historian of the Class and has
prepared a booklet on the ac
complishments of his classmates
entitled Mid-Point for ‘28. The
“Mid-point” refers to their half-
way period as Davidson alumni —
not to their physical properties,
a point of present concern, says
Dr. Davidson in his preface, to

many of the Class. “Some have
more than they want, others have
less. It depends on how you meas-
ure.”
The Class of '28 has already fur-
nished nine sons to Davidson Col-
lege, those at present among the
undergraduates being: Pete Orms-
by, Ed and Tommy Douglas, Joe
Hall, Charley Hall, Davey Jones
and Harry Peterson. Only three
sons of ‘28 have reached college
age and matriculated at other in-
stitutions.

its atmosphere, the painter today
often subordinates these to the
structure of his composition, often
weaving them into a merely formal
pattern. He may elaborate on cer-
tain aspects of the theme or iso-
lated elements as is seen in Klee's

Prepares Return
Of Girls’ Pictures

Pictures to be used in the beauty
section of the annual have been
returned by the engraver; and they
can be obtained beginning Monday,
May 4, from Bfll Bradford at 126
Duke.

The winners or tne contest will
not be revealed, however, until the
annual comes out some time during
the last two weeks of school.

This year’s annual staff has
adopted a new policy of trying to
return as many pictures as possible
to persons in them, instead of
laying the pictures out and letting
students pick up the ones they
want.

Some of the snapshots will be
turned over to fraternity presi-
dents to use in the scrapbooks; and
the remainder will be given to
individual persons in the pictures,
with the exception of those al-
ready belonging to certain stu-
dents. Mercer Kepler will be in
charge of this duty, and plans to
return them at two different times.

Some will be given back during
the next week; but a few, including
those of fraternity and class spon-
sors, will not be returned until
after the date of publication.

When the annuals arrive, they
will be distributed by members
of the staff from a room in the
Student Union. This year each stu-
dent's name will be printed on the
cover of his annual.
