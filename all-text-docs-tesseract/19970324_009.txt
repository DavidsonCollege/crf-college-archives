Sororities...Davidson style.
Sound like an oxymoron? We
have the info that shows that sorori-
ties can exist within Davidson Col-
lege without disrupting the unique
traditions of the school. Actually,
national sororities could only
complement the existing system.

Sororities are more than just
social organizations. The truth of
the matter is that national sororities
allow their members to become a
part of a group of thousands of
women looking out for women’s
issues (rights, health, etc.) all over
the world. As a member, a woman
is backed by thousands of women
worldwide. How can we, at
Davidson, deprive the women of
this campus the opportunity to be-
come a part of this network?

What could sororities bring to
Davidson College? We want to
emphasize that they would in NO
way compete with the eating house
system. The national sororities are
very willing to work with our sys-
tem. Every group we have talked
to recognizes the eating house sys-
tem as an integral part of the
Davidson tradition. The sororities
really want to come to Davidson.
The sororities that we have talked
to see the eating house system as a
longstanding tradition that has a
very strong background that no one
on this campus wants to see altered.
Therefore, the sororities realize that
if they want to survive on our cam-
pus, then they have to accommo-
date our system. Many have

Twenty-Five Years Without Sisterhood

emerged at schools’ with
longstanding traditions of eating
houses and have found no problem
with coexistence. The sororities
just scale back their activities so as
not to interfere with those of the
eating houses. We used Princeton

‘ University as an example of the pos-

sibility of coexistence between the
eating houses/clubs and sororities.
All of the sororities that we have
spoken to cite Princeton as a parallel
for us because there the sororities
have come in and adapted so as not
to step on the toes of the eating
clubs.

It is also necessary to note that
competition is irrelevant because
eating houses and sororities would
have completely different functions.
We all join our eating houses for
two primary reasons: to eat the great
food with our friends and attend the
fun parties where alcoholic bever-
ages are served. Sororities cannot
serve alcohol. The rules are very
strict and sororities are very closely
supervised by theirnationals. There-
fore, they could never interfere with
the function of the eating house sys-
tem since they would not possess
either of the two elements that form
the basis for existence of the eating
houses. It.could also be established
from the outset that the sororities
would not have houses. Therefore,
the sororities could never serve as
the social focus for women on cam-
pus.

Not only would they not com-
pete with the eating houses, but the

presence of national sororities
would enhance relations within and
between the eating houses. Sorori-
ties would be comprised of women
from all over the school, bound by
ties of sisterhood. The bonds that
would be created would cross eat-
ing house lines and allow Davidson
women to create close friendships
with women from different classes,
different freshman halls, and espe-
cially different eating houses. With
sororities, the freshman women in-
volved are given the easy opportu-
nity of meeting women besides those
on their freshman halls, or besides
the ten women they joined their
eating house with. It is really true
that the friends women make fresh-
man year are highly determined by
who lives on their freshman halls.
The way the system for women is
set up now, it is very hard for fresh-
man women to get out and make
new friends on other halls. Themen
at Davidson have no such restric-
tion. Sororities would give women
on this campus the same CEP ONSE:
nity as men.

The possibility of sororities
creating cliques within the eating
houses or acting as feeder groups
into the eating houses is not an
issue. As they stand now, the eating
houses are not free from cliques. It
is human nature to bond together
with people who are like oneself.
The sororities would actually.serve
to facilitate the creation of friend-
ships outside women’s established
circles of friends within their eating

houses or without. As it has worked
at other schools that have eating
houses and sororities, the coexist-
ence of the two has allowed women
to meet more people and has ben-
efitted all involved. Rush would be
established so as not to effect fresh-
men women’s decision in Self-
Selection. Just as an aside...has the
existence of sports teams as feeder
groups into the eating houses ( i.e.
the field hockey team into Rusk, the
lacrosse team into Warner Hall)
caused problems thus far?

‘Okay, we mentioned it, the
dreaded word, RUSH. We know
that many have the preconceived
notion that rush is a catty experi-
ence that makes everyone involved
miserable. The National
Panhellenic Conference (NPC),
which oversees national sororities,
has recently instigated a policy that
they call "no-frills rush." The theme
parties, banquets, and events that
many women see as "caddie" the
NPC deems "ynnecessary" and "not
real world." The NPC has been
begging the bigger schools to con-
form to the ideal of a more laid-
back rush. We at Davidson could
very easily maintain this ideal be-
cause of the quality of our student
body. We could create a low-key
rush in which women could have
more fun than stress. The primary
aspect that NPC wants to advocate
regarding rush is fairness and en-
suring that everyone who wants to
is given the opportunity to join a

sorority. The financial obligations

are minimal and the benefits are
infinite. The sororities sponsor pro-
grams that focus on issues relevant
to the success of women in the real
world They place a high impor-
tance on scholarship and service.
Members of sororities only begin to
reap the benefits of their member-
ship when they graduate from col-
lege. The network is incredible.
Membership is immensely helpful
in establishing job connections af-
ter college. Sorori-
ties on campus would really just
serve the function of another option
for women. They would act more
like clubs that foster the creation of
close bonds of friendship and sup-
port among the women of this cam-
pus. At this point the numbers are
not too important. We have enough
women interested to bring two so-
rorities to Davidson.

The men on this campus have

_ been reaping the benefits of their

national fraternities for decades. If
the women have this easy opportu-
nity to get in on the game, why not
take it? We; as women of Davidson
should have the right to the same
option as men, both during our
Davidson experience and after.
Even if you are not in agreement
with the idea of sororities at
Davidson, is it fair to deprive the
women of this campus the opportu-
nity to reap the benefits? Davidson
has the longstanding tradition of
brotherhood, but come on ladies,
it’s been 25 years, why not start
creating some real sisterhood?

_ Springtime, Sunshine, and Short Skirts

A while ago, I was sitting out-
side with a couple of the boys, en-
joying the warm sun and getting
overamean hangover. A girl walked
by wearing a skirt that put atwinkle
in my eye and a song in my heart.

I leaned back in my chair, took
a sip of Stroh’s, grinned, and said,
“Y’all, I love this time of year.”

Now, if you’re a guy, I’m sure
that you understand exactly what I
mean, but if you’re one of my fe-
male readers, you might be a tad
offended at this point.

If you are, I dare you to tell me
that you don’t enjoy seeing some
hunk confidently walking by in a
pair of shorts which reveal that he’s
got more than a pair of broomsticks
hiding under his Duck Heads all
winter long. Don’ ttry to pull any of
that double-standard crap on me.

Whether you’re a guy or girl, if
you tell me you just don’t get it,
you’re either repressed, in which
case you’re lying to yourself about
how you feel, or you’re not re-
pressed and therefore lying to ev-
erybody else.

Anyway, asI sat out there medi-
tating on how kind the good Lord is
to give us such a lovely work of art
as the female form; my thoughts
drifted to the way guys and girls
relate around here.

The one conclusion I have
reached over the years is that things

are whacked out to such a degree
that saying théy’re effed up beyond
belief is a gross understatement.

By andlarge, single people here
don’t go out on dates, except for the
occasional semi-formal or cautious
cup of coffee that’s so tame it could
never be misconstrued as serious in
the rest of the country.

When I asked a friend why
things are so whacked, he—or it
might have been a she, I can’t re-
member—smiled and said, “What
happens when you get 1600 nerds
together in one place?”

As we all know, instead of act-

ing mature, plenty of people just get

smashed and hook up. About a
month ago, I heard a couple of guys
talking about this.

The first guy, whom I dislike if
the truth be told, said, “So, are you
hook-up buddies or what?”

_ The other guy replied, “No, it’s
more serious than that. Sometimes
we talk during the week.”

Y’all, just to set the record
straight, “Why Don’t We Get Drunk
and Screw” is a parody of aConway
Twitty song, not a call to arms.

In the movie The Philadelphia
Story, the leading lady—Katherine
Hepburn, Ithink—gets really drunk,
and when she wakes up the next
morning, she’s forgotten what hap-

pened the night berare with Jimmy.

Stewart. .

When she asks him if they did
anything, his response is something
along the lines of, “No, there are
rules about that sort of thing.”

Guys, in case you aren’t famil-
iar with the rules, here are three:

If you go up and grab a girl ata
party, that’s called sexual assault.

If a girl’s too drunk to make an
informed decision about what she’s

doing, and you go all the way, that’s .

called date rape. If a girl says no
and you ignore her, that’s called
rape, pure and simple.

Welcome to adulthood, fellas.

Here I’ve gone and rambled,
though. I was talking about the
dating scene—or lack thereof—
around here, wasn’t I?

I’ve often asked myself why
people don’t go on dates more of-
ten. I think one reason is the utter
seriousness with which women here
take going out with a guy if they
plan it beforehand.

Ladies, when a guy asks you
out to dinner, it means he thinks
you’ re attractive and wants to get to
know you. It’s not a marriage pro-
posal.

The much bigger reason that
there’s not much of a dating scene
seems to be that a lot of Davidson’s
men have to be all liquored up to
have any self-confidence.

Guys, if a girl says she doesn’t
want to go out, it’s not the end of the

world, okay? If you’re afraid of
having your insecure little ego burst
by a sober girl, you shouldn’t be
willing to have it massaged by a
drunk one.

Instead of being such a big
sissy, you ought to think of a couple
of the prettiest girls you know, suck
in your fear, and ask one of them out
to dinner. If she thinks you seem
like an okay sort, she says yes. Then
you go hang out together and see if
there’s any chemistry there without
the aid of the active ingredient of
Beast Lite.

Let me guarantee you, having a
person think you’ re pretty cool when
you’re both sober is a hell of a lot
more satisfying than waking up next

look like in the light.

Now Ill admit that acting in a
way that upsets the status quo is a
little bit scary, but not conforming
never killed anybody. Well, if you
consider the Spanish Inquisition, I
guess that’s not entirely true, but it
hasn’t killed me yet.

I’m sure that I sound like a
condescending ess oh bee right now,
and if you think I am, that’s okay;
it’s probably true. Since I am such
a know-it-all, let me pull a bit of
wisdom out of the dusty vault sit-
ting on my shoulders and end with
it: Dating is fun. If you’re a guy, go
against the grain, act like you’ve
got a pair, and ask a girl out. Lord
have mercy, springtime doesn’t
happen every day.
