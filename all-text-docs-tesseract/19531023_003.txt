FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1953

As the band set the
scene with the dismal
and ominus strains of
“Dragnet,” disappoint-
ed Davidson fans
watched another heart-
breaker go into the
Homecoming record
book. The scrappy Blue
Hose of Presbyterian
had pulled a repeat
performance of their
last Davidson Home-
coming showing as
they edged the Cats
19-18. The jinx of such
long standing still re-
mained intact and 13
was discovered not to

be a lucky number for the Red and

For the thirteenth year in a row the Wildcats had failed
to win their gala Homecoming affair and many a disappointed

alumni and friend went away

shaking their heads and com-

menting, “Something has to be done.” The complacent Da-
vidson student body, who seldom get very excited at athletic
events after, in some cases, having never seen a Davidson
football team win, went away this time without the usual
silence-breaking remark about another “moral” victory.
However, the ever-present “wait till next year men were
on hand and, already throwing away as lost the remaining
five games on the Wildcat schedule for this year, began to
expound on Cat possibilities for next season. Of course, the
“I. can remember when...” historians were around to throw

their comments on past glory.

This is, it seems to me, a dismal picture of what, at least,

the freshmen are supopsed to have—that old, and sometimes
-seeming mythical Davidson Spirit. Every year Davidson fans
are faced with the same old story—“We're outmanned.” Al-
though this tends to get stale and eventually to hit on deaf
ears who refuse to accept this excuse this sad statement just

happens to be true.

Davidson is notoriously a first quarter and first half ball
club. When the boys get tired there just isn’t enough bench
of the same caliber to keep pace with the benches of the op-
posing teams. In every game the Cats have played this season
they have been outweighed, even in the Presbyterian game.
Outweighed and outmanned—yet Davidson fans label the Cats
as “no good” or “sorry” or the ever-present “poorly coached.”

In the words of Coach Dole and a‘number of others who
have been on hand for the game this season, the Cats are out
there “fighting their hearts out.” It seems to this reporter
that Davidson fans must wake up and face the reality that
either we must go down to play in a lower level football con-
ference, become independent and choose a suitable schedule
on our own, or put more money into scholarships so as to
attract better football players to Davidson. It’s time we quit
kidding ourselves with the hackneyed, “We've got eleven men
and so do they. ” Football isn’t played with just eleven men!

In this “Robin Hood’s barn” approach, we have been try-
ing to get at this fact—the Cats are our football team and are
giving each game all that they’ve got and are more than worthy
of our wholehearted support. We point no fingers and call no
names in rejection, but rather in praise for the 1953 Davidson
College Wildcats. Support the Cats. BEAT FURMAN.

Kappa Sigs Tops
In Football Loop

By BUDDY LILES

The Kappa Sigs took sole pos-
session of first place in the tag
football league this week as they
nosed out the defending champion
Sigma Chis in a close thriller by a
13-12 count. The Phi Delts and
the KAs moved into a deadlock
for second place as the Phi Delts
edged the Betas in another close
one, 26-25, and the KAs took the
SAEs 19-13.

The previously unbeaten Sigma
Chis slipped to fourth place after
their loss at the hands of the Kap-
pag Sigs. The Pikas stand just be-
hind in fifth place after two one-
sided victories during the week's
action.

The tag loop became strictly a
Greek league this week as the In-
dependent-Campus Club combo
withdrew from football competi-
tion. Their remaining games were
removed from the schedule and
all previous victories over them
were necessarily removed from
the standings.

The results through last Wed-
nesday are as follows:

Kappa Sigs 13, Sigma Chis 12

In the championship battle of
the week the Kappa Sigs edged
the Sigma Chis 13-12 in an exciting
eontest. Eddie Powe and Corky
Gierk led the winners while Ray
Hesding and Perrin Anderson were
the big boys for the losers.

Phi Belts 26, Betes 25

Sparked by the backfield play
of Ish Bennett, the Phi Delts nosed
the Betas, 26-25. Freshman Jimmy
Martin's passing kept the Betas in
the game’

Phi Game 20. Pi Keppe 7

Long passes and a tight defense
brought victory to the Phi Gams
over the Pi Kapps for their first
win of the season. Bob Southwell’s
running and passing sparked the

¥ Pi Kapp attack.
Pikes 39, SARs 14

The Pikas downed the SAPs in
a fast moving battle by a 30-14
count. Backfield ace Bill Hanna

and end Joe Pharr teamed up to
spark the Pika win. Steve Nor-
ton led the SAEs in their second
defeat of the week.
Betas 32, Sig Eps 0

The Betas blanked the Sig Eps
in one of the two shut-outs of the
week. The game was dominated by
the strong Bets defense while Gra-
ham Keith and “Shorty” Scheflos
led the offense in the third Beta
win of the campaign.

KAs 19, SAGs 13

The strong combined teamwork
of the KA squad brought them
their fourth victory and a second
place tie with the Phi Delts in a
close contest with the SAEs. Steve
Norton stood out for the SAEs.

Pikes 33, ATOS 13

Shifty back Bob Owens excelled
both offensively and defensively as
the Pikas took a 33-13 win from
the sagging ATOs. Linny Baker
led in the losing ATO effort.

Sigma Chis 26, Betes 20

The Sigma Chis ran their unde-
feated string to 3 against the Betas
before being knocked off by the
Kappa Sigs. Ray Harding led his
Sigs to the close win.

Keppe Sigs 40, SAlls 0

The powerful offensive attack
and the tight defense of the league
leading Kappa Sigs proved too
much for the SAEs as they went
down to defeat by a 40-0 count.
The passing of Eddie Powe was
outstanding for the victorious Kap-
pa Sigs.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

W&M, N.C.

|Whittle’s Runners Hit

State Today

By SILL HESTON
The Davidson College cross country team, after winning

today to Williamsburg to face

is | over the University of Richmond 19-37 last week, journeyed

two very strong teams, North

Carolina State and William and Mary.

This triangular meet was ex-
pected to prove to be the first real
test for the Cats this season since
they faced last year’s Southern
Conference champs N. C. State and
avery much improved William and
Mary team.

Face Strong State

The North Carolina State Wolf-
pack squad boast of three very
good runners. Among them Saw-
yer, who is one of their best men,
was conference champion in cross-
country and the two-mile last year.
Miller and Shockley are also very
capable runners, however they lost
Garrison, who was conference
champ in the mile last season.

The William and Mary runners
will not prove nearly as strong
as State but they are very much
improved over last year and may
prove stronger than expected.

Cats In Top Shape

As the Cats ran today, Coach
Whittle felt they would have
reached their best condition to
date and should have been about
hitting their top stride. |

The team held its time trials
Tuesday afternoon and the first
seven men to complete the three-
mile run and thus will represent
the Cats at Williamsburg were as
follows: Homer Sparks, Floyd
Feeney, Andy Turner, Dick Lov-
efte, John Handley, Hershel Allen
and Archie Joyner.

The number six and seven men,
Allen and Joyner, did not run last
week against Richmond, but have

improved a lot in the last two;

weeks and are expected to help
the Cats tomorrow.
Conference Decider?

Next week Coach Whittle’s men
will run VMI and Washington and
Lee in what promises to be one
of the best meets of the season.
Three of the four strongest teams
in the conference will be compet-
ing against each other and the out-
come could reveal who will be the

Cagers, Wrestlers
Begin Fall Workouts

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Davidson’s Varsity and Fresh-
man basketball teams will open
practice for their 1953 season on
November 2. Since the Southern
Conference allows no formal prac-
tice before November 1, which is
on Sunday, this is the earliest possi-
ble date for practice to begin.

The Varsity will have a large
percentage of lettermen returning
to action this year. Among those
who are holdovers from last year's
squad are: Ish Bennett, Buddy
Brown, Hobby Cobb, Pappy Fowle.
Ray Harding, Graeme Keith,
George Melton, Eddie Weeks, and
Dickie Adams.

Weeks has received an injury

which may keep him out of action
for the first two weeks of prac-
tice. Bill Proctor, who played here
several years ago before joining
the armed forces, is back, and his
presence should strengthen the
team.
During the month of pre-season
practice and during the season, the
varsity will practice in the after-
noon, while the frosh will occupy
the courts at night.

The Davidson varsity will open
it 1968-54 season on December 2.
They also meet Wake Forest and
North Carolina State in the first
week of the season.

Coach Danny Miller states that
he is pleased with the results of
spring practice and has high hopes
for the team this season.

The freshman team has several
good prospects who may turn the
frosh season into a good one, but
height is needed on the team.

The Davidson wrestling teams
will begin pre-season workouts on
November 2. Both Varsity and
freshman team, judging from past
performance of the men, show
promise of having good seasons.

The Varsity matters will have
several returning starters from last
year’s team. Missing will be Gene
Craven, Carolinas’ A.A.U. cham-
pion, who was captain in his junior

(Continved On Page Four)

winner in the conference meet
later in the season.

Following next week’s W&L and
VMI meet the Cats are tentative-
ly scheduled to participate in the
North Carolina State meet, to be
held at Raleigh. This meet has
been held annually in recent years
among the big five schools com-
posed of N. C. State, Duke, North
Carolina, Wake Forest, and David-
son.

However, this year with the
other four members of the State
conference participating in At-
lantic Coast Conference activities,
the annual affair may be called
off.

The only remaining meets on
the Wildcats’ schedule are the
Southern Conference meet at Wil-
liamsburg on November 16th, and
the Carolinas’ AAU cross-country
meet on the local course on No-
vember 21st.

FROSH GRIDDERS
IDLE THIS WEEK
AFTER FURMAN LOSS

The Davidson freshman football
team goes after its second win of
the season next Friday, when they
knock heads with the Georgia Mili-
tary Academy. The Kittens will no
doubt be working hard to get back
on the victory trail, after absorb-
ing a stinging 27-6 defeat at the
hands of the Furman freshman
team last week.

The freshmen won their first
contest of the season as they out-
played McCallie and came out on
top, 20-0. But last Friday the Frosh
suddenly developed a bad case of
jitters. In losing, they fumbled the
ball ten times, several times with-
in the Furman 20 yard line.

The Wildkittens moved the ball
well, and undoubtedly would have
fared much better if they had been
able to hang onto the ball.

Ken Lawing, the big tackle from
Hartsville, South Carolina, missed
the game because of injuries re-
ceived in the game with McCallie.
However, he will be ready for ac-
tion again by next Priday. 4

r vidson during his junior year.

Steadily Improving

Homer is rapidly proving him-
self to be the best runner to wear
the red and black in several years.
Taking only twenty-two minutes
and forty-five seconds to finish the
tough Richmond course, Sparks
has established himself as one of
the better men in the new Southern
Conference. .

Pete Whittle, cross country
coach, thinks that with the AAC
schools not competing this year
that Homer has an excellent chance
of winning the conference cham-
pionship this year.

Holds Captein Posts

Sparks is captain of the cross-
country team and shares co-cap-
tain hanors with Bill Shipley on
the track team. Homer is a mem-
ber of Kappa Alpha social frater-
nity, and comes from Anniston,
Alabama. Having attended Auburn
for two years before transferring
to Davidson, he is now majoring
in psychology.

Sparks fills the post of Boys’
Work on the local YMCA cabinet
and has been extremely active in
campus’ affairs: since his enroll-
ment at Davidson.

Gridders Meet Hurricane
in Greenville Tomorrow

By ANDY TURNER

The Davidson Wildcats will still be seeking their first win of the season when they
take on the favored Purple Hurricane of Furman tomorrow afternoon at Greenville, S. C.,
in Furman’s Homecoming game. Game time is 2:30 p.m. After last week’s heartbreaking 18-
19 defeat at the hands of P.C., the Cats will be out to try to upset the favored Hurricanes.

Last year the Cats almost did the trick, but fell one point short, losing 13-14.

FRESHMAN RUNNERS
MEET PFEIFFER JR.
FOR SECOND TIME

‘The Davidson freshman cross
country team has been holding
daily workouts in preparation for
their meet with Pfeiffer Junior
College next Monday afternoon.

After taking the measure of the
Pfeiffer team two weeks ago, the
Davidson team will be favored, but
it will be a very close meet. The
meet is to be on the Pfeiffer
course.

Pete Ashcraft and Ted Baker
continue to be the leaders in fresh-
men trials and should show up
well on Monday afternoon.

The freshman team will leave
next Friday for Chapel Hill. On
Saturday morning, they will par-
ticipate in a dual meet with Duke
and North Carolina. On Saturday
afternoon, the team will have the
pleasure of attending the North
Carolina-Tennessee football game
at Chapel Hill.

Coach Bill Dole will travel to
Furman with the squad at full
strength. The team suffered no
injuries against P.C. and had no
contact in practice this past week.

Furman Strong

“Furman has a big, strong team,
and are from three to four touch-
downs better than us,” says Dole,
“but the boys will be out there
fighting their hearts out, and that
is what counts.”

Acker is scheduled to start at
center for the Cats along with
Dickie Davis and Gene Davis at
the left and right guard positions.
Tom Owen and Captain Neil wiil
start at the tackle slots. Corky
King and Jim Davis are expected
to start on the flanks in place of
regulars Dan McCall and Jim Pat-
terson.

Gray or Rowland Direct

Either Bill Rowland or Johnny
Gray will direct the team from the
quarterback position; both played
good games against P.C. Thacker
and either Brown or Smith at the
halves along with Fargason at full-
back round out the remainder of
the backfield.

Furman, thus far this year, has
won two games, defeating the Cita-
del and Newberry by wide margins.
and has lost two; to South Caro-
lina and Army—both national
powers.

Against South Carolina, Furman
settled down after a bad first quar-
ter and played them on even terms,
gaining more yardage than any-
body else has against South Caro-
lina this year, which includes Duke
and the University of Virginia.

Fifth Ranking Offense

Furman has an exceedingly large
team (none under 190 pounds ex-
cept the quarterback) and are
strong on both offense and de-
fense. At present they stand fifth
in the nation in rushing offense
with an average of 275.3 yards a
game. In total offense they have

averaged 342 yards per game,
second only to West Virginia in
the conference.

Russell Sutton, one of the lead-
ing halfbacks of the conference, is
scheduled to be back in action
Saturday for the Hurricane after
missing the South Carolina game.
West, a good passer, will direct
the team from the quarter spot.

injury Plagued

One thing in Davidson's favor
is that Furman is still riddled with
injuries. Both of the regular ends
are scheduled to be on the side
lines, along with several good re-
serve linemen. Bob Sellinger, full-
back, has been moved up to end
to help out in that department.

AAU Cross Country
Event Slated Here
On November 21st

On Saturday, November 21st the
Davidson College cross Country
team will play host to the Caro-
linas AAU cross country meet. The
meet will get under way at 11:00
a.m. and will be run over the local
four-mile course.

AAU chairman A. H. Whittle
announced recently, that a team
trophy will be awarded along with
medals for the first fifteen finish-
ers. Invitations have been sent out
to all organized teams in the two
Carolinas and the meet is open to
any and all distance men in the
two states. This meet will be the
final action of the year for the
Cat runners who will make a
strong bid for the team trophy.

Several interested teams have
already contacted Coach Whittle
and a good representation of the
two states is expected to partici-
pate in the distance affair.
