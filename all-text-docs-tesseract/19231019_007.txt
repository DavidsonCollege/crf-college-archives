SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
MARK

During the past week the margin between
the amount already subscribed and the final
goal in the six hundred thousand dollar cam-
paign for rebuilding Chambers Hall was de-
creased by subscriptions to the amount of |
$15,000.00. There are now in the hands of |
the campaign workers between nine and ten |
thousand subscriptions, amounting all to-|
gether to $575,000.00. This leaves only $25,- |
000.00 yet to find, an amount only half as |
large as that subscribed by the students |

|

Mr. Lockhart and an assistant are now |
working the state of Georgia where they |
hope to raise the rest of the amount. Their
headquarters are in Atlanta at present, and
will probably remain there for a month or |
more.

The contract for building the south wing
has not been let so work will not begin for |
some time, however in all probability, the |
entire south wing containing classrooms and |
offices will be complete by the opening of
the next fall term.

deep into Davidson territory. After an
exchange of punts Citadel put up her
hardest offensive and made two first
downs in rapid order, but the Wildcat
line settled down and held. The quarter
ended with the ball in Citadel's posses-
sion on Davidson's 47-yard line.

Citadel opened the second quarter by
punting to Davidson’s 10-yard line, Hen- |

which was doing valient work. O’Shaugh-
nessy recovered for Citadel. The Bull-
dogs failed to make first down account
of an offside penalty and Faison’s ac-
curacy at knocking down and
punted. Mendrix accounted for a_first
down, made by DeArmon. over right
guard, by making a nice gain around
right end. “Shepherd registered a first

down when Baker dropped a pass which
he had snatched out of midair ‘tand ad-

Davidson was good for a touchdown but
for this hard luck. Citadel was forced
to punt and Davidson started another

It was in the last four minutes-of this
Davidson, in an effort to
the penalty, completed four
straight passes, Shepherd and Coving-
ton pulling down two each from the
hands of Hendrix. The half ended with
Davidson still on their march.

Davidson came back strong in the
third period and in the first few minutes
on play registered the only score of the
game, bucking the ball over after placing
it‘in striking distance by a long pass.
Play was in midfield, both
teams holding well, Lindamood did good
work in this period, breaking through
and nailing the Citadel backs for sever-
al loses.

ed and was covered, the ball going over
on Davidson’s 47-yard line. Several ex-
changes of punts followed, Shepherd get-
ting off the longest of the game, which
netted 48 yards. Fields and Pinkney
were doing great defensive work backing
up their respective lines. Davidson was
gaining in the exchanges, and play was
resumed in Citadel’s territory. The game
ended just after Black made two straight
first downs on line plays, the ball in
Davidson’s possession on Citadel’s 48-
yard line,

Hendrix ran Davidson’s team in grand
style and displayed great leadership.
Shepherd was doing great footwork and
generally excelled in all lines. Black
produced yardage on eighty, percent of
his plays for a net gain of 4 yards per

play. Wick was showing great form and
seems to be developing Judy Harlan’s
style of line bucking. Faison was in his
old form and held his end impassible.

The Davidson substitutes did them-
selves proud while in the game, Coving-
ton made nice gains at critical times and
was on the receiving end of the several
passes. Baker played right end like un-

yards gained, Berry and Allan produced
nice gains through the line. ‘Pinckney
was unmatched in his good work on de-
fensive, back of the line, having a good

ear for solving plays and frequently
plugging a big hole. Benson and Ne-
smith were good in holding Davidson

down on her usual strong point, end

Davidson played well up in the air,
completing 7 out of 10 forward passes
for a total gain of 69 yards. Hendrix
passed with uncanny accuracy and most
any Wildeat seemed able to snag them.
