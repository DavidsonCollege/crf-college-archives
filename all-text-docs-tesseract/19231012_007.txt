| ALBERT S. MAXWELL, 09,
| EXPLORES WILDS OF BRAZIL

Mr. Albert S. Maxwell, who with his
brother Herbert graduated from Davidson
in 1909, and during their stay here were
known as the “Gold Dust Twins,” has re-
cently returned from a very perilous but
successful exploration of the wilds of South
America. His tour lasted over seven
months, and during that time he traveled
| the entire width of Brazil. and even pene-
trated -Balivia. .-He had an excellent oppor-
tunity to become acquainted at first hand
with the aboriginal Indian inhabitants and
with their customs. The first half of the

dangerous, almost impossible, task was com-
pleted, and he had turned homeward, when
he was attacked virulently by the severe
malarial fever of north Brazil. He lost
flesh, his hands seemed those of a dead man,
and he lost so much strength that finally he
could not continue his journey. His friends
had to leave him to come down the river in
a frail canoe guided by a negro.

The jour-
ney was full of danger and difficulty. At
times snags and hidden rocks threatened to
overturn them, At other times wild Indians
on the share made it impossible to land and
hang the hammocks for sleeping, or to pre-
pare food. At last, however, the long jour-
ney of a month and a half was completed,
and a once white, but now yellow man, al-
most a skeleton, and with the flesh almost
dry on his bones, staggered into the little

hospital at Matta Grossa, Brazil ‘Phe long-

lost, noble missionary was safe, and has since

students on Our Devotional Life.

Hugh Wells spoke on Bible Study in con-

devote to it. He especially emphasized the
importance of half an hour study each day.

INFIRMARY PATRONAGE
TAKES SUDDEN SLUMP

The patronage of the infirmary has taken a
decided slump since last week, only three
students having made short stays there in
the past seven days. This decrease in’ sick-
ness is good evidence that the new students,
who were in the majority of those answering
the sick call the first of the term, have be-
come better adjusted to their environment.

The infirmary roll for last week consists
of one Sophomore, FE. T. Buck, ‘and two

A Fire-Prevention-Week Message

, America loses $1,370,000 of her wealth and
fifty of her citizens every day from the ravages
of fire. Seventy-five per cent of this waste and
slaughter can be eliminated through careful-
