ARE WE ULTIMATELY PATRIOTIC?

To answer this question we must sec
what other allied powers are doing in
an internal way. Then keep in mind
what we have been called upon to do,
and have we done it? Make the com-
parison between our sacrifice and that of
England.

Harry Lauder, a great and famous
entertainer, says with his own pen that
he has subscribed every single penny of
his fortune, consisting of several million
dollars, to the British War Loan. We
have oversubscribed the two Liberty
Loans and well that we did. It was pa-
triotic. But who in America has made
the sacrifice that Lauder made? It is
true that it has not been necessary in the
United States that one should go to such
straits. But the great player has exhibit-
ed to the world the spirit of self-sacrifice,
and he did it willingly.

These little verse in lighter vein give
a safe and sanc interpretation of the de-
votion and sacrifice England is making:

“A Wail From England.”
My Tuesdays are meatless,
My Wednesdays are wheatless,
I'm getting more eatless each day.
My home it is heatless,
My bed it is sheetless,
They’re sent to the Y. M. C. A.
The barrooms are treatless,
The coffee is sweetless,
Fach day I grow poorer and wiser,
M;, stockings are feetless,
My trousers are seatless,

My Soul! But I do hate the Kaiser!

Now m this regard how are we re-
sponding? Mr. Hoover, the National
Food Administrator, has asked that we
have a meatless day each week. Dr.
Martin in a chapel talk has made this
doubly impressive and positively urgent.
Tt is true that we as students are not
entirely responsible. The ladies of the
homes in which we board vie with one
another as to who can give the better
board. They are going to give us meat

before us every meal every day of the
week. But we are continuing to eat our

(H2S). If you go to some hotels on
‘Tuesday morning fur breakfast they will
trot out December 25th
turkey hash—and tel you that “This is
meatless day here.”

If it is imperative, which indeed it is,
we should ask the managers of our re-
spective houses to see that we adopt one
meatless day cach week, and one other
day. for wheat and sugarless occasions.
This is a matter of grave import. If our
government says do this, let’s do it. This
is patriotic. Financially we have sub-
scribed, and in many cases the sacrifice
was appreciably nothing. It would not
ultimately disrupt the sensous nature to
go without one of the concentrated foods
ene day during the week. Look into
this matter.

The poet was evidently not consider-
ing a college campus like ours is in its
present condition when he penned, “A
thing of beauty is a joy forever.” The
campus is besmirched with leaves which
have long ago lost their Justre and gold-
en tinge. It needs the umbrella staff of
Uncle Hiram, who went about gigging
waste paper. Worst of all—it is being
cut by little paths into little sectors—
horribly ugly in their contour. If you
were not at chapel Monday morning we
will say that Dr. Martin has kindly re-
quested that no one tread these paths.
We do not say “Never walk on the cam-
pus.” But we urge that you do not walk
in these newly-made paths. Also, let's
keep our waste paper off the campus,
soon to be so lovely and green. ,

COLLEGE TOPICS.

If you are interested in college life, its
conditions and problems, we refer you
to some current magaine articles. The
first of these is Robert L. Kelly’s “The
American College and the Great War.”
appearing in the January Scribner's.
This is a unique defense of the college.
shown by the attitude college men are
taking to hasten the vigorous prosecution
of the war. It gives definite data in re-
gard to decrease of student bodies. This
article is worth your while.

Another fine article is by a foreigner
—M. FE. Ravage, who has given Amer-
ican college men something to consider
in “The Tired College Man,” in the
January Century. He discusses the in-
digent lack of interest in the vital and
stirring issues of the day and in the great
movements of the past. This is spirited
and arouses one to a fuller sense of duty
and responsibility.
