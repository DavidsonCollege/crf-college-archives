More For The Money

Anyone connected with Davidson knows that we
could use more money. The cancellation of four ma-

jor scholarship® funds recently has served to em- |

phasize this need. are

Catalogue increases on a significiant scale are
as certain as death and taxes, even more perhaps.~*

For those reasons the hiring of a~new vice pre-

‘gident, this one in charge of finances and fund rais-
ing, seems to indicate a welcome determination to
solve. these problems. -

We welcome Cornell to our community and wish
him great and immediate success in his endeavors.

Yet at the same time students cannot help but
begin to wonder at the expanding corporate struc-
ture threatening to engulf South Chambers. Presi-
dent Spencer now has an assistant and two vice pre-
sidents more than the had last year.

We have a large new computer, costing several
‘thousand dollars a month, which-is more noted for
its failures than its successes. We have a new foot-
ball fund raiser who is still more than 75 percent
away from his end of the year goal. .

What is most needed now from this expanding
bureaucracy is action, not more expansion. If ac-
tion does not come, some serious fat trimming and
consolidation of operations would seem to be in or-
der.

Otherwise increasing tuitioit will soon push costs
beyond acceptable bounds and rising financial aid
costs or decreasing student diversity could well com-
bine to push this college rigpt off the map of reput-
able liberal arts colleges.

Alternatives To Grading

Beginning this fall term Stanford University ‘has
joined the growing list of colleges who have taken
steps to eliminate emphasis on grades in their edu-
cational systems. It is time that such changes were
considered for Davidson as well. :

Along with the elimination of the penalty F,
the system provides for grades of A, B, and C with
no plus or minus grades and with no grade. point
averages.

These changes too would be ones Davidson could
well use to improve the “exciting and challenging

experience” which college officials claim Davidson’s .

education to be.

___.Too_often courses here degenerate_into—a_con-
test between professor and student. On the one. hand
the professor is pretending to produce: tests that
purport to be numerical indications: of the student’s
knowledge. . /

On the other hand are the students, worried
over points, not knowledge, but points. By the time
the end of the term arrives most students can not
only quote their averages in’ every course but can
also tell you how many points they need on the final
reviews or exams to get the total number of points
that they, for one reason or another, want from the
course. Ne:

The nauseating absurdity of the whole procedure
of a Davidson education is then officially promoted
by the registrar’s office which not only requires
these points totals to be reported but which refines
them to the fourth decimal place.

The fourth decimal place, it is important to re-
-member, is the exact precise value of one ten-thous-
andth of the knowledge to be gained from any course
here at Davidson. :

Such a system is not in keeping with any claims
of true educational -excitement or challenge.

Perhaps if these egregious faults in our system
could be eliminated, real progress could be made
on further: educational reforms including off cam-
pus work for graduation credit, more’ independent
work, eliminating archaic attendance rules, and_the
complete abolition of the testing system as an ac-
cépted method of educational measurement in any

It is time now, when Davidson is fond of boast-
ing of its educational progress over the past several
years, to seriously “consider adopting changes such
as-those at Stanford.and elsewhere to make David-
son an educational institution rather than an insti-
tutional education. - :

Power Of Youth Requires
Impending Age Of Maturity

We have all heard it a
thousand _ times. Over
creamed chicken and apple
pie at the yearly Good Citi-
zenship Banquet, on the
hustlings, and in church, the
message is always the same.

Our young people, it is
said, are the leaders’ of the
future. Instant |, sentimental-
ity°and security in the know-
ledge of one’s mission’ in
life. ;

In spite of the almost ab-
surd triviality of the ‘state-
ment, it has become an arti-

_ Cle of faith in-our society. .!

suspect that the majority of
Americans, evén now, asso-
ciate youth with hope rather
than destruction.

So all of this talk about
power strikes me as rather
absurd. Sooner than many of

us might wish, we will have
“power: our public faith wel:

comes it, simple chronology
demands it.

‘Now the question of what
we will do with this power,
once attained, has not been
given the attention it de-
senves by anyone on either
side of the generation gap.

Although some may _be-
lieve that an Age of Reali-
zation will dawn as the» gen-
eration now in _ college
reaches thirty, I imagine
that we will see the same
old difficulties confronting
some new faces.

In ‘light of the trpubles
which America is enduring
at present, an Age of Ma-
turity would’ seem to be
more in order.

By this is meant an era
in which we learn to accept
our limitations and to work
within them for the. better-
ment of life in America.

What we are speaking of
here is, for one thing, the
death of Utopianism. As
noted last week, we have
promised ourselves too much
and are now paying -the
price for it.

The task facing future
leaders is to define those
things
can do and those with which
it can do nothing.

This will involve a. sacri-
fice which may be too much
for politicians of all ages,
the toning down of rhetoric
in favor of rationality,

The public discussion:

which needs to be conduct-
ed on the nature and extent

~ of our limitations, for they

are far from self-evident,
cannot take place as long as
mindless sloganeering. and.-
boundless promises reign
supreme in American politi-
cal life.

In order to avoid the kind

of dissatisfaction which
plagues us at present, lead

ership in the future must in- -

volve teaching more than
propagandizing, realism
rather than false hope.

Yet the recognition of

limitations) does not neces-

sarily imply impotence in
the face of social and _politi-
cal problems. Limits, if
they can be defined, would
be, the
which effective action could.

which government

boundaries within ©

take place.

Thus, the second necessary
characteristic of leadership
in the Age of Maturity would
be the ability to achieve
those things which it defines
as possible.

The prime’ task. of leader-
‘Ship would be to make its

_proposals: work, rather than
: image creation. The prag-

matie’ test would he ~ the
basis of judgment: those
things would be cast aside
which did not fulfill their
promised function.

Programs, in other words, |

would cease to be part of
their sponsors’ egos.

The Age of Maturity is a
pipedream, of course, based
on the false assumption that
man will somehow be better

PAUL ROWLAND

The . following are the
words and views of friend
and past editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, Frank-
lin Anderson.

Since the mid - October
bombing at Harvard, there
have been 80 bomb scares at
Boston University where I
am a student.

(At first evacuation of
threatened buildings was re-
quired. Some people were
bodily removed from their
dorm. But with up to 12
scares a day, they now just
notify occupants -of the
threat and let you leave if
you want.

Violence isn’t the way,
just and most obviously be-
cause it won't work. The
people who have the wea-
pons (the means of violence)
in this country are the army,
police, national guard, etc.,
but advocates of revolution
have alienated them, malign-
ing them as pigs and bomb-
ing them.

‘As I see it we have three
possible courses of action to
change the American situa-
tion: 1
. 1, Revolution by abandon-
ning the system may have
some validity but is faced
with two problems. First, as
observed above, the system
is virtually unassailable
from without, and, secondly,
there is the very real dan-
ger of replacing one disaster
with another.

2. (Renewal is basically
patchwork. It is using rub-
ber bands and scotch tape
to keep a machine running
even though it should be re-
placed.

ping outside the system to
examine it, figuring out
what needs doing; stepping
back in and doing it.

This is the most difficult
of the three: it is most. sub-

ject to the subtle treachery _

of circumstances and en-
vironment.

Nevertheless, reform does

‘have the advantage of allow- '

ing one to keep the good
that ‘is present in this Sys:
tem and in any system,

tomorrow than he is today.

Yet, if we are. serious
about justifying’ the public
faith in our potential, it
‘might not be a bad goal
to try for.

Frankly Speaking

while ripping out the ‘evil
within it. With revolution,
you losé all of the system,
but in,replacing, you may
easily restore the evil in
other forms.

We are frustrated because,
in a sense, we are under-
taking two transformations
at once: life style and poli-
tics.

By life style, I mean
everything from hair and
dress to ethics, work, and
the language we use. Often

Ag

ROWLAND

politicaItransformations
are hampered by those in
life styles, such as_long-
hairs campaigning for pro
gressive candidates.

It is urgent that Ameri-
ca be convinced that human
life, love, justice, - truth,
joy, peace — in short, all
that is worthwhile and good-
is more important than any
economic. or political insti-
tution.

We need to change not
just laws but -also people.
Though structural changes
do facilitate attitude altera-
tion» (for example, integra-
tion), and it is vitally im-
portant to incorporate these
attitudes within the system,
the work is fruitless if the

... American _ psyche’ remains
3. Reform involves step- -

authoritarian, intolerant and
narrow.

PS. Yes, I would like to
get rid of the system and all
its hassles’ and replace it
with nothing. It is an en-
chanting thought, but de-
ceiving. You don’t have to
believe in original sin to re-
alize the impossibility —
but conversely, use every

opportunity. you_get-to dump
- the’

repressive, inhuman
parts of it, and maybe we'll
all be a little better off.
