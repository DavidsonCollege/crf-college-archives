am not sure how to avoid it.

Vernon: This (adversary system) is anti-commun-
ily

Bliss: That is a different game which belongs to
a different community ... than the college commun-
ity, :

“Vernon: All this leads back to the problem of
not having a defined legal system, of course this is
just the first year of this court system. but I think
we would have beén helped by (having a written out
procedure). This would help anyone involved in the
courts and those not involved.

McLean: After these recent controversial events,
do you believe Davidson can still have an efficient
“community court’ system? ~

Bliss: I think we can.

Baker: There is a great number of people who feel
that the defendant should have taken the tack he
started out on .. . determined to sue the college. He
didn’t present any defense the first time; it looked
like it would go straight through every appeal body
up through the trustees and then it would come in
a civil case. Certainly this is not an attitude of com-
munity. --

Roberts: If you're going to. an adversary court
system, you simply can’t have a court of amateurs.
You have to have trained legal people. I don’t know
of any one member of the Regulations Court who
feels competent to even consider that sort of case.

Bliss: I-suppose that if we are going from one to
another, that we are going to, suffer for some time
from the conflicting demands of the adversary system.
I think that the college community system can work.
I think its chances of working very effectively would
be greatly.enhanced if this kind of spelling out of
responsibilities came about.

Vernon: There’s a problem in drug cases of evi-
dence, also what can be used by the defendant in the
trial (in the way of methods of active or passive de-
fense).

quired to come up with hard evidence of the nature

Harley Branch, chairman

up this point, noting that the
students who had originally
presented the Code to the

would promote student self-
enforcement of rules, speci-
fically those on drinking,
which were being ineffective-
