LIGHT DAVIDSON TEAM
RUSHES MOUNTAIN BEARS

(Continued from page 1)
Henry Sapp had snatched up a Mountain
fumble on the run and carried it for 17
yards into Lenoir territory.

In the same period, Wells carried the ball
over the Lenoir goal line, Davidson missing
a touchdown when Gresham grabbed the
fumbled ball for a touchback.

In the third quarter Hewlett ran the Da-
vadison second team, with third string men
under his command at times. Another touch-
down was made as McComb and Sapp cut off
great gobs of yardage, Hewlett slipping un-
der center for the score.

After Popsy Hunt had scored the first
field goal of the season for Davidson, the
Red and Black machine took the pigskin on
Davidson‘s 20-yard line, and Covington and
McComb carried the ball for 80 yards, Teddy
making the touchdown on a 12-yard drive
through center.

Black and Hunt had a perfect day at place-
ment kicking, both getting three try-for-
points out of the same number of trials;
and Popsy sending the ball over for a three
point score.

Campus to Have
Another Wildcat
For Its Mascot

Once more a wildcat, snarling and rag-
ing, will’stalk back and forth in his cage
at the Davidson gymnasium. That ter- |
tible fighting symbol of Red and Black

athletics will again be placed on the,
campus. |
At chapel Monday morning, a_ plan

was presented to the students by Ted
Covington, whereby a wildcat could be
purchased. A full grown North Caro-
lina wildcat was recently caught near’
Fayetteville, N. C, and is now offered
for the students of Davidson for the
sum of twenty-five dollars. Covington
stated that if each student would con-
tribute ten cents, the wildcat could be
purchased and, in addition, his food sup-
ply would be taken care of for a month

The student body immediately voted
to pay this amount for the wildcat. |

Thereupon, Covington announced that |

The first string men were. taken out be-
fore individual stars could be developed, the
whole team showing up well. Captain Davis
watched the game from the sidelines, follow-
ing an operation performed several days be-
fore. Phil Cox, playing his first game of |
the season, with Nappy and Pinkney out, |
showed the makings of a good end.

Sappenfield and Hewlett ran the team well,
while Hunt calling signals for the last few
minutes, brought the. Davidson team to the
Lenoir two and one-half-yard line, the game
ending with two more downs to go. Baker,
playing opposite a 220-pounder, showed his
usual speed and fight.

For Lenoir, Gresham, at fullback, was
almost the entire team, his defensive work
bemg the strongest point of Gurley's team.
Playing without a head gear, his bushy head
was at the bottom of all Lenoir’s tackling.
He was the spirit of the team,
