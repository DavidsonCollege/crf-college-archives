OPINIONS

Diversity demands expression

My roommate must have
reached new levels of desperation.
He has come to me, Casey
Hawthorne, the man he dubbed
“the math dork,” asking for an ar-
ticle. I guess we know who has
won the duel of majors between
math and English. Let it be known
that I would never go to the so
called “El Jefe” for help with math.

Despite, as Stan Boyd so aptly
stated last week, the gun being at
my head, I’m actually writing to
voice a true concern of mine. I
recently took part in an interview
about dating at Davidson. , After
answering the myriad of questions
ranging from “how do you define
hooking up?” to “does dating actu-
ally exist at Davidson?” I began

wondering how people at Davidson >

really get to know each other and
what activities on campus actually
facilitate such intimate encounters.

The best and most universal

example comes fromclass. We are
forced to intermingle daily with
new people with whom we must
have something in common or we
wouldn’t be in the same class. Un-
fortunately, however, I would have
to say I haven’t met any life long
friends in a

one close relationship sitting at my
house trying to digest another corn
dog or running naked through the
women’s houses on self-selection
night. :
Along with the fraternities and

social activity forums. Unfortu-
nately short.

After compiling this list I real-
ized there still exists a large neces-
sity for organizations where people
can socialize and meet. Not every-
one likes going to the court, not
everyone enjoys

lecture.
Then
there are

There are also lists of admin-
istrative programs sponsored by
the Union, and, of course, the list
of eating houses and fraternities.
Speaking from experience, I can

eating houses we have the scores
of parties each semester. But it is
really hard to get to know anyone
when you can barely understand a
word they say, or when you can’t
even remember their name the next
morning. That’s pretty much it for

edge the few
unique examples such as the Dean
Rusk Program, F.L.A.G., Hobart
Park, the Young Republicans, and
such programs provided by a few
majors such as the language tables
at the Commons or the math
coffees. But somehow I think be-

varied student body we have failed _
to meet many of the interests out-
side of writing, foreign affairs, lan-
guages, orscholarship. A friend of
mine goes to the University of
Texas where there exists such di-
verse and extreme organizations
as the Young Cross Dressing At-
torneys.

This may be 4 little bizarre,
but it proves the point that diverse
interests exist, and they need atten-
tion. We could have organizations
for displaced Yankees suffering
from carpet bagger prejudice. We
could have a crew of people who
study and enjoy certain types of
music. I would like to be the first
to invite people who love to cook
to form a cooking club that experi-

I have been consumed this
week by sex. I suppose that the
proper term is “gender,” but in this
ever increasingly politically cor-
rect world a little boldness cannot
hurt. Anyway for some reason
every conversation that I started
this week turned rapidly to a dis-
cussion of gender relations. Now
the fact that I am on the Rusk
board, and helped organize “Hook
Party” may have had something to
do with it. The truth of the matter
is that I learned alot this week from
these conversations. There are sev-
eral varieties of opinions about
what certain Davidson terms mean.
Considering that I always give my
opinion before someone asks for
it, here is my list of Davidson terms
as I have seen them over the years:

Hook: Contrary to some of the
definitions I heard from people
this week, “hook” does NOT mean
having sex. Yes, sex happens here
at Davidson, and yes it happens

sometimes while “hooking,” but a
hook can mean anything from a
kiss on the dance floor to staying
over in someone’s room for three
weekends in a row.

Watching a Movie: This term is
arguable, but from my experience

tions are good ways of getting to
know people. I have taken all of
my friends for years and they have
returned the favor. I can honestly
say I have had a better time than
most people that are suffering while
trying to “hook” with their dates.

Chillin’ by a certain fast frat boy
friend of mine, this term is the
alternative to dating at Davidson.

It is the eternal state of limbo that.

even have a VCR.

Date Function: Date Functions are
not threatening events. If someone
asks you to a date function you are
neither beholden to hook up with
them or have a relationship
(fear!!!!) with them. Date Func-

Dating: I am not really sure how
to define this considering it hap-
pens so infrequently at Davidson
except for certain seniors and jun-
iors who prefer to refer to dating as

being “together.” In other words’

she is with him and he is with her.
Hanging Out: Also referred to as

phone isa myth at Davidson. Con-
trary to the rest of the world I think
that the phones stop working on
Sunday night. So keep that in
mind next time you are waiting for
acall. Calling isa varied issue, and
inall of my conversations this week
noconsensus occurred, except that

not calling after a date function is a
major faux pas. Calling leads me
to my next term .

Saying. Hey: Picture this, you are
walking on the third floor of Cham-
bers on the Union side. “HE” or
“SHE” is walking towards you
coming from the Poly Sci side. Do
you say “hey, what’s up?” and
keep on going, or do you actually
stop and talk to the person even
through you fear an awkward situ-
ation? Chances are one or the
other of you could bolt down those

life saving center stairs. I person-

ally would recommend talking to
the person.

I have learned a lot this week.
Everyone at Davidson thinks dif-
ferently about the gender situa-
tion.

All of the chaos about Hook
Party and Senior Champagne Par-
ties has given me some hope, how-
ever, in that we are thinking, and at
least this week, we are all talking.

love it when people stop by to visit
or give me a ring. The human
voice is a lot more appealing than
a computer screen.

And what happens when you
start interviewing for jobs? You
can’t do that via e-mail. If I ever
catch someone trying to ask some-
one else out on a date over e-mail
I will go bizerk. There are definite
benefits of the technology of the
computer age, but we can’t let our-

. Selves loose every last skill we
have by-relying completely oncom-
puters.

Nothing seems real anymore.
Remember the old days when

people used to “call” on their
friends instead of using stealth
voice mail messages or e-mail to
communicate?

Remember when companies
would send real, live representa-
tives to meetings instead of speak-
ing over computer generated con-
ference screens?

Maybe I’m just old fainioned:
I like people more than machines.
When I graduate in May and as-
sume the CEO position of a major
corporation, I’m taking everything
back to old school. Maybe I dis-
like computers because they are
smarter than me.

Or maybe I just get lost i in this
age of tofu, modems, fax machines,

- fake breasts, afternoon talk shows,

athletic strikes, and Microsoft Win-
dows. Either way, I’m scared,
because if I’m overwhelmed at 21,
Idon’teven want to imagine where
I'll be at 61.
