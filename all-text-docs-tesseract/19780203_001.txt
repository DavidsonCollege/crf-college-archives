PCC announcesreserved openings

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer

At a meeting of the Patterson
Court Council Wednesday night,
representatives of each eating house
and fraternity announced the number
of openings they have reserved for
freshmen choosing to go through
self-selection.

The ceilings for the houses are
SAE-20, Emanon-25, ETC-25,
PAX-30, Pika-20, ATO-15, Phi Delta
Theta-21, Rusk 35, F&M-25, and
KA-15.

These ceilings are flexible; the
groups may elect to accept more
freshman than they have indicated.
They may not, however, accept fewer.

Briefly, the new self-selection sy-
stem*will work in this manner: Hach
freshman will fill out a sheet indicat-
ing his or her preference of eating
clubs, listing one, two, or three
choices. Dean of Students Will H.

Terry and student representatives
from each house will go through these
sheets in a random manner.

The drawing will be held February
16 in the Union. “All freshmen are
welcome to attend, Terry said.

The results will be posted- and the
houses will be asked to inform the
students.

Each freshman will be assigned to
the house of his or her first choice.

The preference sheets will be gone
through in reversed order to give
students who did not get their first
choice a chance to join the house of

their second choice. After this is done
a third time, students will be assigned
to waiting lists.

If a student is extremely interested
in joining one particular house, he or
she may elect to list that house as his
or her first choice and indicate no
second or third choices. If in this case

the house is already full, this student
be given a place on the waiting list
above other students who have listed
second and third choices.

“If a person single-shots a house,
this means joining this house is
more important to him than just
getting into a house,” said Terry.

On the other hand, the person who
lists choices is probably more con-
cerned with becoming a member of an
eating house in general according to
Terry.

Some representatives have said
that they realize this constituties a
‘‘loophole.’’ Under these rules, a
house can set a very low ceiling and
then admit people who are high on the
waitng list.

This loophole will not be taken
advantage of according to several
house representatives.

“We are going to go through the

system just like everyone else,’’
indicated KA President Vance Chris-
topher.

SAE President Will Miller feels
that ‘setting a low ceiling would not
be in the spirit of self selection” and
said that SAE would set a ‘‘reason-
able’”’ ceilings.

At present, there are 231 openings
for freshmen in eating houses out of a
class of 383.

“T am aware that a lot of houses are
very concerned about getting too
large,”’ said Terry.

He is also aware that there may not
be enough places for everyone to join
a house of their choice.

‘We will expect each house to be
conscientious about setting a realistic
limit for the house,” he said.

‘‘T am very concerned that two
houses have decided to take only 15
people,’’ said Terry.

‘“‘The houses have always been
cooperative in understanding the
overcrowding problems and _ taking
into account the needs of the fresh-

After one week of operation,

Davidson College’s Security
Force is currently underman-
ned, with each of the three
officers working overtime.
Twenty-four hours during the
week there are no campus
officers on duty.

Before the decision by direc-
tor of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze to split the
college campus from the juris-
diction fo the police, five
officers staffed the campus
precinct headed by Captain
Jackie Hughes.

No campus officers were on
duty this week from 6:30 am
to 2:30 pm on Tuesday
Wednesday, and today. One
town officer patrols off cam-
pus during those hours on
Tuesday and Wednesday. The
Two town officers patrol on
Thursday.

Meetze expects no additions
in personnel for two weeks.
‘Hopefully, we will have some
by the end of the month,” he
said. He said the college force

will eventually be composed of 3
five or six officers, including }

Hughes.
Following the January 16

announcement of the split,
officers assigned to Town Pre-
cinct #2 (the campus grounds)
were given 24 hours to decide

whether to join the colleges |

security force or remain, with
the town police department
Officers Gussie Latta and
Charles Burton joined with the
College. The force officially
began duty on January 26.

Meetze felt assured at the
time of his decision that some
of the town’s officers ' would
join the College. Had they not!
Meetze replied, ‘‘I would have
pulled a shift, you would have
pulled « shiftys we all would
have pulled on until we hired
some help.”’

Gampus precinct
lacks manpower

“The reason this all was so
sudden,’’ Meetze explained,
“is that I didn’t want all these
people wondering what was
going on, and where they were
going to work.”’

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry, although not consulted
in the decision, called it ‘‘a

A group of students have
requested that the Faculty
Professioal Affairs Committee
(PAC) conduct an “immediate
and thorough investigation’’
of the College Administra-
tion’s recent decision not to
renew the contract of Assist-
ant Professor of Political Sci-
ence and Director of South
Asian Studies Tonia Devon

The students — Dave Bar-
nard, Harry Greyard, Peggy

made the request this week in
a letter to PAC Chairman

Albert Allan ‘Wolf, Professor
of Physics.

major concerns to the atten-
tion of the PAC. The concerns
were:

A. Lack of a codified set of
procedures for soliciting eval-
uations: There ig-no specific
number of evaluations re-
quested. This institutionalizes
subjectivity in that conclu-
sions may be hastily reached,
based on an inadequate num-
ber of opinions.

B. Student Evaluations: At
least one student was ignorarit
of the fact that her comments
were to be used in the evalua-
tion of Dr. Devon. Another
student found it necessary to
inquire into the nature of her
conversation with Dr. Zim-
mermann. By such procedural
flaws, the evaluation suffers
from off-the-cuff comments.

C. Criteria: There was an
inconsistancy and vagueness
in the evaluation of Dr. De-
von. Prior to our meeting with
Drs. Spencer and Zimmer-
mann on January 18, 1978,
three criteria had been given
by the administration: pro-
fessional competence, teach-
ing ability, and community
involvement. At our meeting
with Drs. Spencer and Zim-
mermann, a fourth criterion
was given: ‘The kind of
person [he/she] is.’’

Using .the original, exito-*=
we find in the area of 1.
professional competence: par-

ticipation in faculty research
groups, recent scholarly re-
search in India, and presenta-
tion of papers at professional
meetings; 2. teaching ability:
the majority of the students
find her most effective, and
have benefitted from exposure
to her courses: 3. community
service: participation in public

affairs programs at Quaker.

and Unitarian Churches, par-
ticipation in the “‘Great Deci-
sions’’ course, a community
enrichment program and _ in-
troducing to the campus a
wide variety of cultural e-
vents. Where was her weak-
ness?

D. Failure to communicate
shortcomings: Dr. Devon was
never informed of any weak-
ness in her performance or
effectiveness. During the eval-
uation process, at least one
other faculty member was
given notice that there were
shortcomings in teaching
method. Should not the admi-
nistration be obligated to con-
sistently pursue its policy of
informing faculty members of
deficiencies?

e. Future of South Asian
Studies: The administration’s
action in this particular case
raises serious questions about
the College’s commitment to

program. :
The ‘students also raised

questions about the implica-
tions of this case for other
untenured faculty members.

“We would ask you to look
at the burden that has been
placed upon the untenuréd
members of the faculty. Al-
though we do not claim to
represent the view of every
untenured faculty professor,
we observe a dangerous trend
emerging after talking with
several untenured faculty
members.”

“These young professors see
a competent faculty member
dismissed because she had a
personality conflict with a
member of the Administra-
tion, and because she spoke
out during the Linden Affair.
These professors perceive an
administration that is stifling
dissenting opinions.

“Here are some quotes from
different untenured professors
about Dr. Devon’s dismissal:
“despicable,’’ ‘‘a vendetta,”’
“The message is clear: Don’t
rock the boat.”

“During our meeting with
Dr. Spencer, he said that the
main concern of the |admini-
stration was to build ‘an
outstanding faculty.’’ It. is
ludicrous to suggest that an
outstanding faculty can be
built on a foundation of inti-

athe. future of the Sauth Acian,.jfidation.”
