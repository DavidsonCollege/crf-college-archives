Holland Sees
‘Potentially Best Ever’

S

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

If things go as expected,
next year’s freshman bas-
ketball team could be the
best in.» Davidson's history.

Coach Terry Holland and
his assistants have already

obtained three top pros-
pects, have signed two
others who only await the

approval of the admissions
office, and have a_ sixth
player virtually signed.

The first cager to join the
Wildcats was T. J. Pecorak,
whose brother John started
for this year’s
freshmen. Pecorak, who
hailed from Fairfax, Vir-
son High School, is a 6-6
forward.

He was the first
from his high school to top
the 1,000 point mark. An
excellent shooter, he
points per
his senior year, and yet
took only 16 shots per game.
Besides shooting almost 60°
from the field, he also aver

6-5 forward John Falconi
was the second signee for
Coach Holland this year. He
is from the Bronx and play-
ed high school basketball at

forward at 188 Ibs., Falconi
neverless made the All-New
York City ‘team, a_ distinc-
“tion attained in past years
by such Davidson standouts
as Mike Maloy and Bryan
Adrian.

The third prospect who
has signed with the Wild-
cats and has been accepted
is Dave Crawford. In Craw-
ford, who is from South Hill,
Virginia, Holland found the
big man that Davidson has
been lacking for several
years. He will be one of
the biggest men ever to
play basketball here, stand-
ing 6-10 and weighing 240.

Mike Maloy would have

honors at the annual bas-

night, if only he had been
there.

Maloy, who missed the oc

vote of his teammates.

Doug Cook was named as
the team’s most improved
player while Jerry Kroll
won the free throw award
for the best percentage on
the team from the free
throw line.

team the best ever here.”

Two other prep stars have
signed with the Wildcats
and need only be accepted
by the admissions office,
which Hollands believes is
a certainty. Both prospects
are fine students with good
college board scores.

Due to the present uncer-
tainty of their status with
the admissions board, no
names can be revealed, but
Holland believes that. the
announcement of their ad-
mittance is forthcoming.

Both of the signees are
forwards. One is a 6-7 Wash
ington, D. C. product, and
the other, a 6-5 Boston pro-
duct, was one of the most
outstanding high school
cagers in New England.

Intramural Council Considers Revisions
To Maintain Competition, Participation

“The intramural program

all students of Davidson

‘College to participae volun-

tarily im competitive sports

This is the catalogue
statement on athletic com
petition for the great non
intercollegiate mass at Da-
vidson.

Just what the role of the
intramural program should
play on the college campus
is the qustion which the in-
tramural Atheltic Council is
now facing.

In the light of
dissatisfaction: with the cur
rent IMAC format, the coun-
cil met Tuesday.

sweeping changes for next

was delineated.

A committee is preparing
the constitutional amend-
ments for next weeek's

According to the
gram’s_ director, Sterling
Martin, there were sev-

prompted the move. “'! felt

The new changes, being
written into the  constitu-
tion by council members

Bill Berry and Jim Wright,
are aimed at upgrading the
freshman program.

Under the new plan, there
will be five freshman teams,
each representating

this will give a little incen-

Martin and Berry both em
phasized that the changes
would make the TMAC more
amateur in

nature. ‘“‘Any

ed in a sport will be inéli-

part,’” Martin explained. ‘In
addition if a boy is parti

kind he is ineligbile for the

The past year wasn't one
of the poorest in Davidson
history but Stevens was far
from satisfied with the per-
formance his club made in
10-15 record.

“1 was disappointed in
out overall performance
this year. | thought we'd
play at least .500 ball this
year. We were a lot better

posting a

than last. year even if we
didn’t win a_ lot more
games.”

The improvement in the

Wildcats which Stevens talk-
ed about is mirrored in the
team's final statistics. This
year’s team hit .266 as com-
pared to last season’s .218.
The team’s earned run avy-
erage dropped from better
than 4.5 last year to 2.78.

The pitching staff was the
brightest spot on the team
for Stevens. ‘‘We pitched
well enough to win. Rick
Pipan finished with two
straight shutouts. and three
wins in the last week. Wade
Shepherd did a fine job for
us and ended up with a 1.99
ERA.

“Davis Beaston and Mike
Frye both did very fine
jobs for us 189 they pitch-
ed. Beaston had a 1.43 ERA
and Frye’s was 2.04.”

Stevens also singled out
Marshall Case as a definite
bright spot for next year.

“Case didn’t do as we
had hoped he would
pitching this year because
we used him at third and
he didn't have the time to
work on his control. I hope
that next year we can re-
lieve him of playing third,
he’s a very good pitcher.”’

keys in the limited success
which the team enjoyed in
the latter part of the year.

Slade, who led the
team in hitting at .346. The
entire pitching staff will re-

“This gives the competi-

Martin also pointed out
other informal extensions of
intramurals such as faculty-
student competition and
open competition without
the championship pressure.
Despite the flaws in the
existing program which the
coun¢gil is now trying to
eliminate, both Martin and
