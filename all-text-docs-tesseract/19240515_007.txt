Class of 21 Turns to Davidson

Suite 1, 411 Marlboro St.
Boston, Mass.
May 5, 1924.
To the Class of ’21:

As most of you know, Jicky Taylor,
oru alumni class president, and I sent
out a circular letter tothe class not long
ago. Here are the results of our work
as gathered from the replies and various
other sources of information.

Jicky, whose official name is J. P., Jr.,
is living at 863 W. 5th St, Winston-
Salem, N. C. After a number of months
on the road selling flavoring extracts for
for the Hartley-Taylor Co., he has settled
down to a job in their plant at Greens-
boro.

As for me, I am a hard-working stu-
dent at Boston Tech, and expect to re-
ceive my degree next March. I’ve con-
tinued my track work and have made the
Cross Country and Track teams here. I
hope to be present for our reunion in
1926, As I expect to establish myself in
the South upon graduation, it is quite
likely that my hope will be realized.

I can always be located through the
address, 3506 Berwyn Ave., Baltimore,
Md., so you fellows be sure to keep me
posted on your movements.

Sincerely yours,
A. FRANKLIN FRICKER,
Alumni Secretary.

In the mind of every serious
thinking college man there arises a
question—“*What am I going to do
after graduation?” This question
presents a serious crisis. It de-
mands a definite decision.

In an unusual degree the Life
Insurance business combines the
opportunity for conspicuous bus-
iness success with the opportunity
for real social service. Here is a
profession that is eminently worthy
of consideration.
