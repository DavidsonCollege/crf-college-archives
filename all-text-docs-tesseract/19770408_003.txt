PIRG offers form; tackles wilds, cans, and prison

By EMILY MASON

The North Carolina Public
Interest Research Group (NC
PIRG) has completed its Off-
Campus Housing Guide for
Davidson students.

This guide contains a listing
of the location, number of
living units, conditions, rental
fees, and ‘“‘other pertinent
information’’ necessary for
people who want to use off-
campus housing,’’ according
to John Hedrick, Chairperson
of NC PIRG. |

Completed early this week,
copies of the guide have been
placed at the Union informa-
tion desk, the library desk, the
NC PIRG desk in the Union’s
student offices, and in Scotty
Nicholls’ and Dean Terry’s
offices.

NC PIRG members have
been visiting Davidson stu-
dents in an effort to ‘‘involve
students more heavily in the
PIRG organization,’’ said
Hedrick.

Point of Order

The purpose of these visi-
tations is to acquaint the
student body with the goals
and functioning of NC PIRG,
and to solicit both ideas and
help from the student body,
Hedrick explained.

A similar visitation among
the faculty is planned for the
upcoming weeks.

Beyond these Davidson-
centered projects, NC PIRG
has several on-going projects
of national concern.

First, the Boundary Waters
Canoe Area wilderness in nor-
thern Minnesota is threatened
with exploitation if the Fraser
Bill, presently being consi-
dered by the U.S. Congress, is
not passed.

Hedrick sees the passing of
this bill as ‘‘a major environ-
mental concern,” as its rejec-
tion by Congress would rep-
resent the first such opening of
lands proclaimed as wilderness
areas.

To aid the bill’s success,

Hedrick and NC PIRG mem-

bers are carrying a petition
door-to-door, requesting sig-
natures, When every on- and
off-campus housing facility
has been visited, “the petition
will be forwarded to the North
Carolina delegation of the
U.S. Congress.”

PIRG members are del-
ving into the issue of beverage
container legislation, another
national concern.

Stationing themselves out-
side the Harris Teeter super-
market in Cornelius, Hedrick
and Frank Dale asked shop-
pers to fill out a questionnaire
and indicate their preference of
returnable or non-returnable
beverage containers.

Based on some 150 respon-
ses, Hedrick sees the trend
‘going toward returnable bev-
erage containers’’ at the mom-
ent. Additional response will
be sought this Wednesday and
Thursday from shoppers at
Cashions supermarket, also in
Cornelius.

A third on-going NC PIRG

Young delays referendum

By TRACY UPCHURCH
Staff Writer
The proposed addition to
the College Constitution,

scheduled to be presented to
the student body in a referen-
dum last Tuesday, has been
postponed at the order of SGA
President Thom Young.

The addition proposed to
make the President of Patter-
son Court an ex officio mem-
ber of the Council on Campus

and Religious Life.

Young learned that the
President of the Union is also
not on the council. Since he
believes that the Union Board
president should be an ex
officio member, he has intro-
duced a new constitutional
amendment to add both presi-
dents to the council.

The new amendment must
have two readings before the
Senate before the student

PAC plan differs
from current practice

[Continued from page 1]

This rejected form is handed
to new professors by the
Academic Vice-President as
the basis for their evaluation.
It’s hard for a professor ‘’to
know the way it really is,” ac-
éording to Kaylor.

The PAC plan does differ in
some respects from current
college practice, according to
Kaylor.

For instance, the plan states
that department chairmen
should serve for five-year
terms with the possibility of
reappointment. Presently, de-
partment chairmen serve no
definite terms.

The PAC plan makes it clear
that the faculty do not oppose
student evaluation question-
naires.

It states, “‘The Vice-Pres-
ident for Academic Affairs
shall give every student the
opportunity to evaluate each
course and the performance of

each teacher through the use
of a standardized question-
naire.”’

But PAC does maintain
that such questionnaires must
be confidential, must be
signed by the student to
eliminate frivolous answers,
and must not be filled out until
after the exam period.

Also, PAC asks that the
faculty be informed of exactly
what the forms will be used
for.

Under the new College Con-
stitution, it is the respon-
sibility of the ‘‘ President or his
delegate” to meet with PAC
and come up with a ‘‘Code of
Faculty Evaluation Proce-
dures”.

Kaylor said that he has not
been approached by Dr. Spen-
cer on the subject and that
presumably he would be the

first to hear if such a code was-
being compiled.

body votes on the measure.
The student referendum has
been rescheduled for April 20.

Tax Council reports

Chairman Steve Barnes. of
the Activities Tax Council
appeared before the Senate
and received approval of his
committee’s work.

The committee, which allo-
cates funds to various student
groups, earmarked $3000 for
the Senate. Forty dollars of
each student’s tuition goes
into the Activities Tax Fund.

Committee selection

_ The Third Screening Com-
mittee, chaired by Ralph Yiel-
ding, presented three candi-
dates for the two positions on
the Finance, Personnel and
Development. Committee.

Susan Baynard, Jim Kus-
ter, and Bruce Lantelme were
the candidates. Kuster and
Lantelme were appointed.

The Senate unanimously
approved Susan Davidson and
Stacy Johnson to the Academ-
ic and Cultural Committee.

Stuart Bondurant, member
of the Senate Security Com-
mittee, was praised by Chair-
man Hans Watford for his
work on the Bicycle Registra-
tion Program.

Two reprimanded

Young reprimanded Sena-
tors Rick Rauck and John
Steifel for their poor attend-
ance at the Senate meetings.

He urged the Senate to
apply “peer pressure’ on these
senators in the hope of impro-
we their attendance.

DAVIDSON

project of national interest is
their prison reform program.

NC PIRG has helped ar-
range for a visit by David
Rothenburg to the Davidson
campus. Rothenburg is one of
the founders of the Fortune
Society, a national organiza-
tion ‘‘committed to bringing
ex-convicts back into society
in,a meaningful way,’’ ex-
plained Hedrick.

Also in conjunction with
prison reform, NC PIRG is
working with the Davidson
Penology Seminar, and is
trying to set up summer
internships which would be

available not for salary, but
“for the experience’.

Next year’s NC PIRG offi-
cers have been elected. David
Snyder will-be Chairperson,
Tom Johnson will serve as the
NC PIRG State Board Repre-
sentative and .Co-Treasurer,
David Barnard will serve as
Co-Treasurer, and Chuck
Gaddy will serve as NC PIRG
Secretary and will be in charge
of publicity for the organiza-
tion.

Next year’s other board
members will be Sam Craw-
ford, Kevin Taylor, Frank
Rambo, and Maria Patterson.
