The wrestlers started out the sea-
son a little slow but have picked up the
pace as of late, winning three of their
last four to improve their overall record
to4-6. After winning the season opener
against Wagner by a score of 21-19, the

.Wildcats experienced a losing streak
against Boston College, Columbia,
Anderson, Duquesne, and Slippery
Rock. The team then turned things
around and swept a quad meet at Wash-
ington & Lee on January 9. The ‘Cats
were victorious over Pensecola (28-
18), Washington & Lee (32-10), and
Johns Hopkins (43-3).

has been the success the wrestlers had at
the quad meet at Washington & Lee. In
the first match against Pensecola,
Davidson notched six individual wins
to help lead the team to victory. Dan

Kaplan, Alan Roe, and Jeff Storms all
came out victorious against Pensecola.

The Wildcat wrestlers were
matched up against the hosts of the
meet, Washington & Lee, in their sec-
ond match of the day. Carman, Kaplan,
Roe, and Storms were again the victors
in their matches. Ryan Owens, An-

added victories of their own to help lead
the ‘Cats to a team victory for the sec-
ond time that day.

“spurts.”

For the Lady ‘Cats, it was quite the
contrary. They would have loved to see
this December last forever.

The team went 7-0 from Decem-

opponents by an average of greater than
20 points per game.

The head coach describes this sea-
son as “the most fun yet.” Who can
blame him?

After losing a difficult setback in

rebounded with decisive victories
against UNC Charlotte, Bucknell, and

their conference record to 5-3.

With that mark, the Wildcats find
themselves in the thick of the confer-
ence hunt. They are now situated in a
four-way tie for third place in the con-
ference, just two games behind league-
leading UNC-Greenboro.

“T’malittle surprised at how com-
petitive the conference is, there are seven
teams right now in position to win the
conference,” said Filar. “I’m excited
right now, but I’meven more anxious to
see where we’re gonna go. We want to
bring a Southern Conference title here,
we want a banner.”

‘Cats finished with their most decisive
victory of the tournament, 43-3 over
Johns Hopkins. This was the greatest
team effort the Wildcats had amassed
thus far with Kaplan, Roe, Justin
Perkinson, Andrew Friedman,
Storms, Waldron, Cox, Carman, and
Bender all finishing victorious.

The rest of the season looks prom-
ising for the Wildcat wrestlers, hoping
to improve from last year’s Southern
Conference Tournament performance.
There are two more home matches this
year. The first one, on January’ 30 at
3pm, matches Davidson against Nor-
folk State, and then Davidson faces

We need them to be

Davidson’s best-
ever showing against the Seahawks.
The Wildcat men (3-7) fell by a
mere 21 points. According to head coach
Rich DeSelm a Davidson victory was
well within reach but UNCW (6-4) was
able to capitalize on the ‘Cats lack of
depth in the diving and sprinting events.
“It (the meet) was bittersweet,” DeSelm
said: “We pulled together and com-
peted well but no diving and depth in
sprinting is our achilles heel.”
Despite the loss, several Davidson
swimmers had outstanding perfor-
mances. Freshman Graham Graveley

won the 500 and 1000 yard freestyle
events. Senior Michael McCabe tri-
umphed in the 200 freestyle and took
second in the 100 free while sophomore
Kurt Hirsekorn claimed second in the
200 yard individual medley and first
place in the 200 breastroke. Also, ac-
cording to DeSelm, junior Sam
Kuykendall’s times in the 200 butter-
fly and 200 backstroke are faster than at
any point last year.

Onthe women’s side, the ‘Cats (4-
7) encountered what DeSelm termed a
“dynamic” UNCW team that stood at 6-
2 and was undefeated at home. Al-
though the final 139-92 indicates
Seahawk command of the meet, DeSelm
was pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance. “We did the best we’ve ever
done against them,” DeSelm said. “Each
year we are encouraged.”

Individual standouts for the Lady
‘Cats included junior Rachel Horak
who had lifetime best times in both the
50 and 100 yard freestyles. Also, junior
Mary Shell Brosche continued to suc-
ceed in her dual role as a team leader
and an outstanding performer. Brosche
claimed second in the 200 free, 200
individual medley, and 200 backstroke.
Also, according to DeSelm, freshman

Heidi Hester has continued to improve
as the season progresses. Hester took
third in the 500 freestyle with a time of
5:14.47.

After the tough competition from
UNCW the meet against N.C. A&T
was a welcome change of pace. The
‘Cats utterly dominated their opponents
winning by an astounding 118 points.
Davidson finished first, second, third in
nearly every event.

With one month to go until the
Southern States Championships, which
the ‘Cats have won two years in a row,
DeSelm is pleased with his team’s cur-
rent progress. ~“‘We had our best trip
(annual training trip in Ft. Lauderdale,
Fl.) in six years,” DeSelm said. “We
challenged them and they responded.”
As far as goals for the remainder of this
season, DeSelm says he would like to
see a drop in overall times and improve-
ments in the diving events.

On Friday at 3pm, the men take on
a talented Georgia Tech team, while
both the men and women compete
against a well-rounded College of
Charleston squad on Saturday at 2pm.
Both meets are at home.

last Friday night.
