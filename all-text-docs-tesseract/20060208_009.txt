Student petitions to allow masturbation as a lifetime sports P.€. credit

Earlier in the week, AndyHodge ’07, who
was recently informed he has yet to fulfill
any of his Physical Education requirements,
submitted a petition to the department head
Julie Smythe
to request
using mastur-
bation to ful-
fill a lifetime
sports credit.

Hodge, who
is currently
single, feels
that the
request will be
granted.

“I don’t see
why it won’t
be approved,”
he said. “It’s
something I’ve
been doing
pretty much ©
my whole life,
and I don’t
plan on stop-
ping any time
soon.”

The petition has started quite a campus
stir, with proponents on both sides of the
issue. The debate is particularly relevant in

light of the fact that some first-year students
recently used flashlight tag to obtain their
lifetime sports credit.

“Flashlight tag gettimg these freshmen -

credit is really what irks me,” said Hodge.
“How are you going to give them a lifetime
credit for doing something that would result
in your virtual social expulsion past the age

Townies: fi conversation with
Davidson librarian Mildred Peart

The Yowl: In this week’s edition of
Townies, we'll be talking to longtime
Davidson Town Public Library librarian,
Mrs. Mildred Pearl.

Mildred Pearl: Actually, it’s Miss Pearl;
I’ve never been married. But I like to think
that I’ve always had a loving and caring
spouse in the rows and rows of books here at
the Davidson library.

TY: Of course, and I’m sure that’s a very
* healthy relationship. Did your family always
emphasize the importance of reading?

MP: Oh, I don’t really have any family any-
more. Just me, the books and my lovely cats.
I have 93 cats, and it
would be tough to
remember all of their
names, but I have them
organized according to
the Dewey Decimal
System. One of my
favorite cats is 107.911.
The reference cats are,
of course, in their own
section of my home.
Someday I hope to
show all of them off in
my favorite non-librar-
ian oriented magazine
“Cat Lady.”

TY: They have maga-
zines for librarians?
MP: Oh, of course! My
favorite is called
“Overdue.” Actually,
last year, I wrote an opinion piece for the
magazine “No talking.” It was fairly well-
received by the librarian community.

TY: What sort of interesting things has the
Davidson public library been, up to recently?
MP: Well, I don’t even know where to begin.
We just got this new poster that says
“Bookworm,” and it has a drawing of a worm
wearing glasses and reading a book. I think
funny things like that show the lighter side
of the library.

TY: What is your feeling about overdue
book fines?

MP: Book fines iceus fresh litter in
Professor Mittens’ box.

TY: How long have you been a librarian?
MP: Oh, I've librarianed for almost as long
as I can remember. I began my career dur-
ing World War II, when all of the men were
fighting overseas and it became more
acceptable for women to find work as librar-
ians. You see, it used to be that only men
. were librarians, but few people knew that
because they still all dressed as women. It

was quite Shakespearean, actually.

TY: Right. Let’s move on to a slightly less
disturbing topic. What are some of your
favorite books?

MP: Oh my, that’s like asking me who my
favorite husband is!

TY: That doesn’t make any sense.

MP: I would have to say that my favorite
book is “Encyclopedia Brown and the
Mystery of the Main Street Ghost.” I have
read it hundreds of times,- and I am still
shocked everytime I find out the Main Street
Ghost is actually local rapscallion Buster
Davis. Oops! I didn’t mean to give away the
ending; you can
just edit that part
out.

TY: Will do. So,
what are some of
your
parts of being a
librarian?

MP: The prestige
is really impor-
tant to me. It’s
also a wonderful
conversation
starter. I can’t tell
you how many
times I’ve been to
a dinner party
and just dominat-
ed the conversa-
tion with various
anecdotes regard-
ing my work.

TY: What is your opinion of microfiche?
MP: I’m pro microfiche. But I can certainly
see the argument from the other side.

TY: What is your relationship like with the
Little Library at Davidson College?

MP: I’d really rather not talk about it, thank
you very much.

TY: Do I sense some animosity there?

MP: Let’s just say we don’t see horn-
rimmed glasses to horn-rimmed glasses.
Those Little librarians think they’re so high
and mighty just because they’re ‘academics.’
They look down on public librarians like me
because we have entire sections dedicated to

Dr. Seuss and engulf ourselves in a sea of |

cats. Did you know that they don’t even have
library cards there?

TY: Yes, that’s certainly true. Well, thank
you very much for your time, Miss Pearl. We
here at The Yowl certainly appreciate it.
MP: Wave good-bye to the nice reporter
Professor Mittens. Bye bye! Bye Bye!

TY: Bye bye...

Health Advisor Marge Plimpton supports
Hodge.

“Everything he’s doing is completely natu-
ral,” she said. “In fact, it is readily encour-
aged among the medical community.”

Plimpton said it is not only a great way to
relieve stress, but is also great for cardiovas-
cular fitness as well as a low-impact muscu-
lar workout.

“With the fast-paced and _ stressful
lifestyle of our students, it is only fitting that
we allow this as a healthy alternative to
other, more danger-

Many students campus-wide seem to
agree with Hodge.

“If this passes, it really opens the door for
those of us who are both busy and un-athlet-

feel intimidated by jumping into a competi-
tive environment with muscular and slightly
scary classmates. This is more of a solo act.”

For every supporter, there is equal oppo-
sition. Religion professor Per Ganter is one
of the strongest voices of opposition.

“This is a preposterous proposition, and it
makes a mockery of the institutions of
Davidson,” Ganter © said.

“The best part about it is that it’s free,” he
said. “Well, maybe not the best part, but I’d

Sunday mornings.”

“Students signed up for

Town police arrest VAC thief, crook

Campus Safety officers arrested Anthony

Remlinger denies any misconduct regard-

occasionally had to

Eclipse.

Despite the evidence against
him, Remlinger insists that he
is innocent of any wrongdoing.

“Stealing the artwork was
not a crime, but rather an inno-
vative piece of art in itself,”
Remlinger said. “You see, I am
a performance artist, and my
so-called theft of the paintings
was a_ performance piece
meant to highlight social norms and then
break them down.”

Davidson town police say that Mr.
Remlinger’s artful inspirations do not abdi-
cate him from punishment.

“They just don’t

Remlinger. “I don’t

When asked what

was going to free

unsure.

“My fence doesn’t let me know that sort of
stuff,” he said.

Remlinger, who will be pleading his case
in front of a jury of his peers next month,
will be auctioning off his performance art
piece “The Liberation of the VAC Art,” short-
ly after his trial.
