Instead, a guiding hand

in an editorial.of October 23, (see below)
The Charlotte Observer rebukes Davidson
Students who “seem to have forgotten
their contributors - and-their broader audi-
ence’s wishes; many more people than
Davidson's 1,300 students or board of
trustees are affected.” The writers of the
editorial, furthermore, state that they. are
more concerned about the listeners than
about who controls programming.

The writers of the editorial do not
recognize that the Trustees’ decision on

WDAV ignores the promise made to

Davidson students by the College’ s State-
ment of Purpose.

According. to that. Statement, “David-
son’s primary. purpose is to develop
persons of humane instincts, of disci-
plined and creative minds, and of Chris-

tian character for full lives of leadership, -

of service, and of self-fulfiliment.”

Note that the Statement does not refer
to a purpose or one of the purposes, but
the primary purpose. Any decision—whe-
ther it’s made by Trustees, the administra-
tion, faculty, or students—should be
answerable to that ultimatum of the
Statement of Purpose.

The Trustees have not helped to develop .

“humane instincts” and “creative minds,”
by wresting away from students their

management responsibilities at WDAV.
Creative minds are developed by giving the
students some responsibility. Occasional-
ly, the students will make mistakes, such
as mispronouncing a few words or playing
a few more jazz records than classical
albums.

But when mistakes are made, should
not the Trustees be willing to lend a
guiding hand instead of a hand that slams
students down? Surely, that must. be what
education is all about.

The amount of classical music that
should be played is certainly debatable,
and it is.regrettable that neither the
students nor Trustees could compromise.
Some of the students’ actions, shuffling
record albums into the wrong jackets,

, removing the control board, etc.—are even

more regrettable.

However, do not fault. students for
demanding an education that goes beyond
books, for demanding the opportunity to
learn by managing radio station WDAV. A
college should serve some of the needs of
the community. But now that students
have lost management responsibilities at
the radio-station, the “new” WDAV will
serve the community not through the
students, but at their expense.

The Observer speaks

The following editorial is reprinted from the
October 23 edition of ‘The Charlotte Observer.’’

Radio WDAV is silent, but the Davidson
College campus 20: miles north of Chaf-
lotte, where the 18,500-watt station ope-
rates, is buzzing.

At issue: Who will control what listeners
hear in the 80-mile radius in which the FM
station broadcasts? Should student volun-
teers who operate the station 18 hours a
day have their way in making the station a

diversified mix of classical, jazz, folk and.

rock music? Or are the college trustees,
who want a predominantly classical
station, right in demanding control be-
snag dt deligcan license and

trustees told students the school would

» control the station. They said it will

broadcast primarily classical music to fill
a need trustees see for that kind of
programming in the Mecklenburg area.
Dismayed student broadcasters then
removed the station’s key contro! panel
and other student-bought stereo equip-
ment, and-the 60 students who ran the
Station quit, A referendum Wednesday will
ask students to vote yes of no to a loaded
question whether the trustees’ actions
have been “educationally harmful, finan-

Cially unjustified and ethically irrespon-

sible.”
Meanwhile, schoo! officials, hoping to

be back on the air Nov. 20, have ordered

nearly $90,000 worth of station equipment.

Opinion

Bury

the axe,

but not the issue

By SIDNEY R. MARERTT
Guest Columnist

Now the shouting is over, and
WDAV has emerged as College
property after ten years of
student operation.

Now the agents of reconcilia-
tion, with the best of intentions,
are writing the eulogy of the
affair; they tell us of communi-
cation breakdown, of misinter-
pretations on both sides.

Reconcile? End the bitterness
and resentment? Yes, and as
quickly as possible. Carrington
and I both wish the best of luck
to anyone who would like to join
the new station, in whatever
capacity. But gloss over the
events of the past two years, as
if it were some unfortunate
accident?

No, because it. was no acci-
dent. And my liberal-arts in-
struction would be an expensive
failure if I now did not have the
courage to speak out on what
I've seen.

Put yourself in our place.

You’ve personally authored
no less than four detailed pro-
gramming proposals and sent
them directly to the President,
only to hear him remark to
another official that he was
never quite sure what the
students wanted.

When the Trustees convened
to authorize the high-power
proposal in Feb. 1977, you ask
to attend and are told that your
presence would be “inappropri-
ate.” After the meeting, Ad-
ministration officials assure you
(in writing and on tape) that
WDAV will stay like it is, that
no radical changes are coming,
that it is a “legitimate student
activity.”

And after two years of seek-
ing meetings, dialogue, clarifi-
cations, and confirmation, you
find for the first time (July
1978) that Dr. Spencer had

a. primarily classical station, a
phrase they had never once used
with you.

An Administration official]
gives you a copy of the WDAV
Statement ‘of Policy and Pur-

pose which you helped write in

1977. Except that now soméone
has altered the original wording
to say ‘‘with primary emphasis
on classical music.’’ No one
seems to know who did it.

You watch the Chairman
of your college’s Board of
Trustees, with the head of the
Communications department,
tell the Executive Board that
WDAV may not receive its
license and that we are soon to
be publicly investigated by the
FCC because a student played
one crude song that prompted a
letter of complaint.

They neglect to tell the Board
that the DJ was a freshman
with three weeks experience,
and that he was taken off the air
within an hour of the violation.
They also fail to mention that
thousands of written com-
plaints cross the FCC desk
every day, that they investigate
only consistent complaints over
long periods of time, and that in
fact WDAV already has its
license.

You watch that same Admin-
istration official on television
telling Charlotte that you re-
signed because you did not
want to play more classical
music, after you and your staff
have struggled to raise the
amount of classical played from
20 to 38 hours per week, six of
which you play yourself.

Perhaps C. Shaw Smith was
right when he said that they
promised us input because they
thought they could talk us into
doing what they wanted to do.
Well, for two years we asked the
Administration what they wan-
ted. For two years, they could
have. given us a clear answer,
but they didn’t. They waited
until last Monday.

I’m sorry, but I don’t believe
there was any lack of communi-
cation. There was a lack of
interest in communicating on
the part of certain parties. It
wasn’t the students.
