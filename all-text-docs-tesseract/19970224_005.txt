Soda Shop

By Mary CLARE JALONIC
Editor Emerita

While most businesses on Main
Street are wishing that business
could be better, Soda Shop owner
Deborah Caudle is happy with hers.

“We aren’t hurting,” she says.
She sees her success as due to many
different factors. She caters to the
community by sending out flyers
and encouraging families to come
in. She caters to the College by
keeping prices down and healthy
items on the menu. She emphasizes
a friendly waitstaff and faster ser-
vice. When she bought the restau-

rantin 1993, she expanded the hours

and modernized the kitchen.

“It’s a lot of things,” she says.
“Tt isn’t one thing that makes it
work. It all requires my personal
attention.”

She believes that a business
will succeed if it has the right items

to see to its market.

“Other merchants are interested
in trying to get more students over
[to Main Street]. But I think that’s

a function of your product.”

most businesses can succeed.

“I feel like the leader of any
group is responsible for its success.
I don’t believe in blaming [consum-
ers] for your own mistakes. It’s not
a matter of how I think they should
act, it’s how they do act.”

She still wants to maintain the

atmosphere of a small college town.
“T’ve really tried to maintain a non-
franchise-like, personal atmo-
sphere.”

She feels that Main Street
would benefit from a more diverse
set of businesses. “We all feel like if
there were more different kinds of
businesses on Main Street, then it
would be nice for everyone. But for
whatever reason that doesn’t hap-
pen.”

Like other merchants on Main
Street, she feels that she could never
exist solely on Davidson College
business.

“There isn’t a single merchant
on Main Street who says that the
College is the bulk of their busi-
ness. The College accommodates
most of [student] needs. A lot of
[students] don’t venture out much.”

Caudle says that she can’t de-
pend on any one group for business.

“Tf the students come and eat, it

‘makes me happy. If they don’t, I

still have a business. If I’m going to
be the equivalent of fast food on the
strip, which is what it boils down to,
then I have to cater to all groups.
You have to go for the whole ball of
wax.”

She says that may be one rea-
son for BackStreet’s closing last
June—they catered too muchto stu-
dents. “They probably didn’t stay
as neutral as they should have,” she
says.

The Soda Shop has remained
in Davidson for over 40 years.

lenges of public health issues on
Wednesday night.

Marks talked of the past
achievements and future tasks fac-
ing public health.

“The values and principles in

society and how they interact. They
should be focused to help people
live long and satisfying lives,” says
Marks.

His talk specifically focused
on the increasing population, prob-
lems with tobaccoconsumption, and
the “price of longevity.”

Marks says that the population
level in the year 2050 will most
probably be around nine to ten bil-
lion people. This level will need to
be managed due to “population
momentum,” where many new
people will need a greater level of
resources than before, especially
since the growing population is quite
young.

As the underdeveloped world
starts to gain higher standards of
living, it will need energy and food
supplies that could strain much of
the environment.

“This new population and re-
source consumption increase will
definitely need tobe managed,” says
Marks. :

Next, he talked about the grow-
ing problem with tobacco. He cited
CDC statistics that indicate more
and more teenagers are smoking,
meaning that more people will be
likely to continue smoking into
adulthood.

Tobacco-related illnesses are
the number one cause of death in
America.

“The problem is clearly getting
worse. It will be expensive to cure
all these problems in the future. A
behavior change is the best way to
change results,” says Marks.

Finally, he talked about the
problems America will face since it
has a rapidly aging population.

Currently, the U.S. spends a
third more per capita on health care
costs despite not insuring all its
people and having lower life ex-
pectancies and higher infant mor-
tality rates than any other industri-
alized nation.

“We cannot sustain the current
level of expenses. The prices need
to fall soon and we need to decide
how,” says Marks. “|

have a large role in determining
how to manage medical care costs.

“We must grapple with
society’s values.... Economics and
ethics are both about choices. [Pub-
lic health professionals] look to so-
ciety to find out where to spend our
money,” says Marks.

Still, despite the challenges
ahead, “it will be a most exciting
time in public health during the
next generation,” says Marks. “We
must be optimistic. Ideas and goals
take a long time for working. You
need to be patient and have perse-

Marks looks to recent history

students are already receiving a good
start to pursue a career in public
health because, “a rigorous liberal
