What's Wrong

Publications?

William Allen White, the late great
newspaper editor and publisher was start-

ed on his way to fame by an editorial en-
titled “What's The Matter With Kansas?”
The-title of this thought might be “What’s
the Matter With the Davidson Publica-
tions,” but that’s as far:as the similarity
would go. It won't start any young literary
aspirant on the success trail (which seems
to be, popularly speaking, Hollywood), but
perhaps little
thought, certainly some of controversial

will serve to provoke “a
nature.

Notwithstanding the fact that necessary
printing arrangements render DAVID-
SONIAN material either history or predic-
tion, there is a certain lack of quality in
both student paper and student magazine.
It is the belief of this writer, as well as the
belief of numerous othérs that this absence
of a quality indigenous to the best in col-
legiate writing might be overcome by a re-
vision-of the present rules of censorship.
which not only govern, but gag the aspira-
tions and endeavors of the contributors to
student. publications.

4

SUBTLETIES- TOO IMPORTANT

Unfortunately, it is the case now and has
been for years, that the biggest attraction
in. both magazine and paper lies in the sub-
tleties that have a double meaning and are
designed to slip. past the discerning eye of
the college authorities. Students like to
read this stuff, and the writers like to
write it. .But the general quality of. the
publication is noticeably lessened.

This is by no-means a condemnation ot
the present censors, for the editors of the
publications in question will verify the
statement that the gentlemen serving on
the faculty censorship committee are quite
liberal and certainly fair. So it is by no
means at the present censors that this mes-
sage is directed, but rather at the idea of
censorship in general. Perhaps it is true
that such censorship has been necessary
in times past, but would that censorship
have been necessary had the editors of the
issues in question been allowed full free-
dom of thought and thought development ?
If they had. been given to realize that the
responsibility was their’s and the school’s
to-uphold high standards of writing and
the type of writing that might be profitab-
ly connected with Davidson College?

°

STUDENT CENSORSHIP

Would it not be better if the entire mat-
ter of censorship were left in the hands
of the students, and the students alone?

If the student government is given the
power to decide whether or not a man
might remain in school, could not a stu-
dent publications board pass on the con-
tent of the publications? Would there not
be a far greater incentive for the students
to contribute to and enter into more active
participation? Count the number of mem-
bers of Sigma Upsilon, honorary literary
fraternity, who are serving on the staff of
the present paper and magazine. Only one
hand will be necessary.

FREEDOM OF THE PRESS

If Davidson students are to be trained
in the academic, spiritual and political free-
dom which the school obviously holds as
an objective, and the Davidson graduate
can guide his,life along the road of honor
and ethics to which the student govern-
ment and Christian atmosphere, are con-
ducive, then the freedom of the press must
be recognized here as well as in the Con-
stitution of the United States. The flag is
usually waved to spur inactive and re-
luctant citizens into action, Need it be
waved to stir the administration into action
by which both they and the Davidson stu-
dents would logically benefit? Our tradi-
tions are covéred by the ivy and too often
the dust of one hundred ten years. Is it
not time to cast off the swaddling clothes
and garb ourselves in the clothing of man-
hood ?

Letters To The
Editor....

Dear Editor;

In Re; The announcement made in chap-
el that a basketball game would be played
between the varsity and faculty teams to
benefit the buying of letters and sweaters
for the varsity teams.

It is common among the students as
well as many outsiders for the school to
be termed “tight.” This is all to clearly
emphasized by the name and reputation
applied. to our treasurer. I do not care to
attack or defend this point, but it is evident
that the athletic department is not willing
to lavish its money on those who earned
it and richly deserve it. | don’t mean to im-
ply that they don’t spend it for athletics,
but a poor situation is made ridiculous by
announcing such a benefit as this. Wheth-
er it was meant as a joke or not,-it’ struck
home with athletes and especially those who
earned their letters in football last fall.

As a football manager’! have become
accustomed to hearing the sad story, “sor-
ry, but we don’t have any more of those.”
Surely our teams have grossed enough to
cover expenses such as vital equipment and
their outright obligation to the players.
Other institutions never opened their bas-
ketball games to the public and still ac-
quired enough from student activity funds
to make some recognition for their players,
Here at Davidson we are peculiar, In an-
swer to this situation we have three con-
clusions. Either our student activity funds
are not sufficient or our teams are not
worth buying sweaters for, or our athletic
department can’t or won’t afford the
money to buy them. The student body
knows one of these to be false, so let us
have action. on the other two. The situa-
tion now stands that scornful giggles greet
such announcements as was made and the
letter-men-have-no-letters:-Tf-this “game”
was to be a benefit, should it not have
been for a cause that needed benefiting

not one that should be considered as an
obligation.

Sincerely,

DAVID H. GAMBRELL.

BY BOB RIERSON

Recent upheavals in the David-

son journalistic field and continuing

comment both pro and con as to the
quality of this year’s campus pub-
lications seem to me to occasion
several observations as to the fu-
ture of the Davidsenian. But numer-
ous volumes might be written on
what I have to say when it all boils
Does Davidson Col-
lege really want truly good publi-
cations; and, if so, is it willing to
do something for them? If not,
let’s drop the whole thing and go
on in the same ever-deepening rut,
hut if;,¢0, let’s think it over for a
while.

First of all, a prime requisite for
a really good newspaper is a staff
that is inclined along journalistic
lines, truly interested, so interested
in fact that it would be willing to
devote long hours of brainwork and
sweat to the output of a great
paper. Only those who Would, in-
sofar as is necessary, sacrifice
everything along extracurricular
lines should be encouraged to apply
for staff memberships. And each
application should be scanned by
the new editor for potentialities
that must exist to make good re-
porter material. It is inconceivable
to think that, from a student body
of this size, at least 25 capable men
could not be found who would con-
sider the truly valuable training
afforded by newspaper experience
worth their while. The editors
would still come from the two up-
per classes except in clear-cut cases
of exceptional merit. Nominations
and elections Of all staff editors
should also be based entirely on
merit. :

As for a new setup of the paper
itself, as a starter there would be
six pages with a gradual increase
to eight. Specifically, there would
be a news page (the front page as

down to this:

now) an editorial page (containing

exclusively editorials and letters to
the editor), a feature page (with
such innovations as weekly student
opinion polls and interviews with
campus characters), the regular
sports page, a Y. M. C. A. news
page (consisting of one page so as
to avoid too much of a good thing),
and then the regular page of carry-
overs and advertisements. When
the expansion to eight pages came,
the additional room could take the
form of another sports page and
various trivia with additional ads.
Each page would have an editor in
charge, thus giving each selected
editor a burden of work to make
him earn the privilege of bearing
his title and to give him the experi-
ence that he is seeking. Each editor
would have his own picked group
of reporters, make all assignments
pertaining to his page, and be re-
sponsible for the makeup of his
particular page. Overseeing all
would be the two top editors who
would have only the final editing,
censoring, and assembling to do.
Thus would be eliminated the long,
cold, disgusting, stretches on Oak
Row. Thus also would go the situ-
ation where two or three hardy
souls would be faced with the prob-
lem of*putting together-a news-
paper. Under the supervision of
this new streamlined staff especial-
ly selected for its journalistic lean-
ings, there would be no trouble in
putting out an unhurried and top-
flight paper that would spread Da-
vidson’s fame at least as much if

not—more than any other single
agent.
The question; once again, de-

pends on just how interested every-
ane concerned really is. If David-
son wants a good paper, there are
men here who are ready to give it.
At any rate, here is something for
students and faculty, and especially
staffs of the future, to consider.

Down Fraternity Court .

INDEPENDENTS

From among the Independents
come tidings of unrest, of trends
to the left and right, of radical
mass meetings; but from all of this
we can draw a faint ¢onclusion,
that embryonic plans for organiza-
tion are being formed here and
there, and may produce a new social
group on the campus. ... Let’s all
stand and give a chorus of “Roger
Young” for “Air Corps” Curry, the
fair-haired boy. . . . Plaster and
Clark’ returned from Winston the
other week end all_aglow. Must
have been warm up there in spite
of the snow, hugh? ... We all ap-
preciate Fesperman’s great work
in keeping up Independent sports.
(Mapes and Eborn help out no end,
too.)

DELTA KAPPA

Extensive agreement and other-
wise culminated last week in the
presentation of D. K.’s first initia-
tion ceremony, the product of much
long and arduous brainwork by
Richard, Gribben, Williams and
others. Former pledges, who
emerged pleased brothers on Tues-
day the eleventh included Clark,
Brown, Beatty, Hopkins, Calhoun,
Carr and Newton. Recent visits
from near-by Sigma Chi chapters,
notably from the U. of S. CG. have
provided fine excuses for feeds and
escapades to Erwin Lodge, with
much enjoyment netted-by-hosts-as
well as*guests. Freeman should
definitely get’ the prize for causing
the most hot-dogs to disappear.

PI KAPPA PHI

Pi Kappa Phi was glad to extend
the right hand of fellowship to new
pledge W. S. McSwain of Charlotte.
This week end found the Pi Kapps
bound for the Red Fez Club, located
on the Catawba river, which was
the scene of the Pi Kap-Phi Gam
informal dance. Among the fairer
sex were such notables “Queen Bee”
Garth, Hickory; Mac Hood, Mary
Helms, Nancy Gordon, Miriam
Wren, Anne Williams, Charlotte;
Janet Pharr, W. C. T. U.; Billy
Rose Beckerdeite, Duke; “Tootie”’

Falkner, Warrenton; and Mr. and
Mrs. Helton and Walker of David-
son.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

Brother, Ensign set the pace this
week end with his trip to Mary
Baldwin, where he ushered in a new
heart interest. Brother Sifford jour-
neyed to Albemarle and spent, the
week end playing football (he says).
Clyde Stroup, minus his tennis
team, finally got home, only to
find his lady friend attending a
concert . . . music soothes what?
Pledge Grube visited~ Winthrop,
while Brother Reese went home
again. What’s in High Point these
days? . Brother Anderson finally
got off the campus, but got no far-
ther than the square dance. Seems
Brother McElroy also visited in the
Queen City.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

We take pride in announcing the
new officers for the next year, They
are Ed Lilly, president; Dave Blev-
ins, vice president; John Hay,’
comptroller, Charlie Owens, secre-
tary; Pan-Hellenic Council Repre-
sentative, John Thatcher.

Brother Hector had a heck of a
time in the Toddle House in G’boro
Saturday night. It seems the local
inebriates were giving him a bad
time with everyone’s. coffee. Along
at the same time was Frank Barr,
who-refuses.to-comment further-on
his escapade other than remarking
that he had a fine time (and there
are no quotation marks around the
“fine”’).

PHI DELTA THETA

Deal of the week was pulled by
Brothers Tate, McLean, Newell,
Starnes, and Oglesby who sailed
forth to’Converse via the big blue
returning for Saturday classes.
Seen at the Phi Mu Post Initiation
dance in the Queen City Saturday
were Brothers Tate, Starnes, Mills,
Palmer, Turnipseed,' Sutton, Hooper
and Newell. All reports have been
favorable.

Brother McGeachy spent a quiet
week-end in the old home town. ...

And a merry time was had by all,
save for Gentleman Jim Love,

When into his ear, sweet refrains
were murmured by his Dove.

I love you Jim, more and more—
’tis only you I adore. +

Gentleman Jim, his knees did quiver
—his spine did tingle and

He did shiver. He spurned the
dance and left the floor;

He’s in the infirmary now—fever
104.

Save for the above casualty, all
have returned from a week end of
happy functioning. Dum Dum En-
nett was called on an emergency to
Asheville—his No. 1 colt for the
Kentucky opening is suffering from
distemper. An “unexpected visitor”
flushed Wood-Up alker but he
came thru the week énd in a “roar-
ing” style. A prosperous week end
was reported by Eyes Phillips and
Speed Lacy, the latter now a limit-
ed partner in the “Anchorage”.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Andrew McGinnis Crowell, prom-
inent local young business man, in
an exclusive statement to the Da-
vidsonian announced his choice of
his date for the late great conflict
held at the Red Fez last Saturday
as “The girl I’d most like to be
unique with.” Amos Ragan, wealthy
socialite, had a date with’ a bag
which came complete with interest-
ing contents and a girl to act as an
attractive background.

Mud Rock McKiethan added joy
to the occasion by getting all the

girls on the premises mixed up
with somebody else’s wife until one
of the young ladies decided he had
gone far enough, and in a very
graceful way put it up to him, mak-
ing no bones of the fact that she
intended to give him a hard time
should he insist in continuing in
his present intentions.

KAPPA ALPHA

Tomorrow night promises to be
one of the gayest evenings of the
year for K. A. The Spring func-
tion will begin with a banquet and
continue with dancing to the music
of Billy Knauf. Sponsors for the
occasion will be the dates of the
Seniors. Brother Sam Ervin was
elected to the number 1 position of
Sigma in the annual elections held
last week. The Pan-Hel represen-
tative will be Brother Dick Baxter.
Brother Clayton Scofield is IT and
Brother At Harris is the new IIT,

~The Operating Table

Following a week end climaxed
by social functions of a couple of
the brotherhoods and around
Charlotte, the problem of your rov-
ing correspondent is not so much
what to write but what will get by
the censor.

in

Lest you become wor-
ried before you read further, let
me hasten to add that we are con-
forming in every respect to the re-
cent “lilywhite” ruling of the fac-
ulty which in effect is, “If it’s too
bad‘ for Boston it don’t go.”

The S. A. E.’s held forth with a
function in honor of their new initi-
ates at the Ship Ahoy Supper Club,
and the Kappa Swigs greeted the
coming of spring with a small
rouster at the former Morris Field
Officers Club. Both organizations
have reported a rip-roaring time,
but few details if any werecavail-
able as to what took place. As the
various other spring social events
take place however, we feel certain
that we can procure more accurate
and not such general information.

Politics and Politicians

With the event of spring elections
there is a strained but friendly at-
mosphere here at the pre-seminary
school. . . . Seen hither and yon
