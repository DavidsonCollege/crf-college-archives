Green’s first exhibition
displays color, texture

By CATHY LANDIS
Features Editor

Splashed on the stark walls on the
Union gallery is student John Green's
first exhibition. The paintings range
from vivacious Marilyn Monroe to a
potted plant. Despite the stimulating
colors students frequently collapse in
the conversation pit without giving
the gallery show its due credit. But
allow your eyes to swim through the
unifying blues and greens and the
conversation pit will never look the
same.

Color is Green's medium; green and
blue are his colors. Green’s favorite
medium is oil. Unlike acrylics which
are fast-drying and hard to work
with, oil dries slowly. Green exploits
this quality of oil by manipulating the
paint on the canvas while it dries. He
specializes in making the painting
clear.

Consequently Green creates inter-
esting variations in texture. He
experiments with texture in one of his
latest works in oil based upon an
asperagus fern. He has allowed the
top layers of color to come through
the bottom ones producing a sheen-
like effect. On this particular painting
he worked with paper towels instead
of brushes in order to allow the colors
to blend together.

Another experiment in texture can
be seen in Green’s portrait of Jurgen
Sottung, a German exchange
student. In this painting he creates a
rough, layered texture by molding the
paint with a pallette knife. This
painting is perhaps the most vivid
display of colors.

Green’s use of color is more
aesthetically motivated than

symbolic. On Sottung’s portrait he
mixed the colors on the canvas rather

than the pallatte.

Green concerns himself more with
subject than with composition. He
concentrates on detailed outdoor
subjects such as weeds.. He takes a
simple plant, for instance, and magni-
fies it to the point of abstraction. His
experiences in the Classics Abroad
Program inspire much of his work. On
display now is a blue abstraction of a
mountainous Island in Greece. John
strives for simplicity.

Green has not linked himself solely
to oil. His portrait of Marilyn
Monroe, the first painting which he
completed as a freshman was done is
acrylic. One print on display com-
bines etching, aquatint, and soft-
ground as an attempt to combine as
many techniques as possible in the
most unified fashion possible. His
subject matter is of his Grand-

mother’s house.
John, a senior at Davidson comes

from Fairburn, Ga. where he has lived
all of his life. He first became
interested in art when he took art
lessons in high school.

He plans to paint for a year after he
graduates. He is conscious of David-
son’s influence on him. He thinks the

-Irv Wilson

Art Department is a good -depart-
ment. ‘‘I like its smallness’’ he
commented “‘but I foresee the coming
necessity for expansions as more and
more art majors come.”

So much of Davidson's talent goes
unrecognized. It is a refreshing to see
the products of a student’s work at
Davidson.

Sentelle launches coathangering

Whistling, whizzing, whining in the
night coathangers can be seen flying
out the south end of Sentelle Dorm
and landing on the roof and environs
of the college maintenance buildings.

If a coathanger should happen to
land near the apex of the maintenance
building roof or if one hangs from the
gutter, a loud cheer will go up form
those inhabitants of Sentelle who
have been ‘‘coathangering.”’

Coathangering is a sport, or
‘sanity outlet’’ as one verteran would
have it, played only when there is
something else that need to be done.
It involves simply the throwing of
coathangers out the windows of
Sentelle and onto the roof of the

maintenance building. A scoring

system exists but varies with the
participant.

It is thought particularly signifi-
cant if one can get a coathanger to
hang from the gutter. If this happens
the entire group of coathangerers
will yell ‘‘hanger!’’ and leap around
with exuberance. Then comes the
serious business of defense.

“The only way to defense a hanger
is to knock it off,’’ said one coat-
hangerer. ‘‘Or you can try for a double
hanger and get your coathanger to
hanger off of the other guy’s hanger.
This has been done. See?”’

“T like to play because the game is
so simple and uses such simple
equipment,” said a particpant. Its
nice to have fun doing nothing,” she

continued.

“T don’t know who started it,’’ said
a senior coathangerer, ‘‘but I am
sure that there were coathangers on
that roof four years ago.”

“The only time I play the game is
when I should be studying. I don’t
think it could hold my attention
otherwise,’ said a frank coat-
hangerer.

The game has no heroes. If a
coathangerer ‘‘peaks the roof’’ or
gets a “hanger” he is congratulated
for his skill and favored position with
lady luck. His mark, however, is
forgotten shortly by the other
players. The mark of a true coat-
hangerer is not that he plays the
sport, but that he is one.

Voters pursue haven in Humphrey

By NANCY LONG
Staff Writer

Hubert Horatio Humprey for Pres-
ident in ’76? It’s not as far-fetched as
it may sound. Recent primaries in
New York and Wisconsin have served
to emphasize the fatt that there is no
one outstanding contender in the race
for the Democratic Presidential nomi-
nation.

The primaries have narrowed the
field to a three-man race: Carter,
Jackson, and Udall are all in the
running, but no one candidate seems
to be able to get out in front. Carter
won in Wisconsin, but did poorly in
New York, receiving a mere 13
percent of the vote.

Jackson pulled a victory in New
York, but it was no landslide. Udall’s
‘‘must’’ win in Wisconsin didn’t
occur; his strong second-place finish
was just enough to keep him in the
race.

Many signs suggest that the big-
gest winner of them all may have been
a hauntingly familiar face. H.H.H.
may emerge as the Democrats’ ‘‘com-
promise candidate”’ in New York City
this July.

There is much speculation within
the ranks of the Democratic party.
Among the Democratic establishment
* Carter is not a favorite. He’s an
outsider; his thoughtless remarks
about ‘‘ethnic purity”’ have hurt. His

momentum seems to have slowed.
Liberals point to Jackson’s hawkish
Vietnam stance; conservatives insist
that Udall is too liberal.

As a result, many appear to be
turning towards the haven that
Humphrey represents:there’s some-
thing safe and comforting in fami-
liarity. He’s a middle-of-the-roader,
neither ultra-conservative nor ultra-
liberal. He’s got experience--thirty-
two years in the Senate, four years as
vice president and the 1968 Democra-
tic nomination are all under his belt.
He's got a good record and, according
to some, the ability to win.

Meanwhile, Humphrey remains
the Democratic nomination. As a

result, ‘‘Draft Humphrey’’ movement
is being organized by concerned
supporters. Although Humphrey dis-
avows any personal connection with

“HLH.H.
in
76? f
It’s possible!

the effort, it is no secret among
Humphreyites that the movement is
being organized with H.H.H.’s
approval and encouragement.

Recently Robert Shaw, chief of the
“working staff’ of the draft move-
ment, met with U.S. Representatives
Paul Simon of Illinois and Bob
Bergland of Minnesota, who have
been pressing the ‘‘Draft Humphrey”’
movement for months. According to
some reports, Short received the
go-ahead to begin contacting dele-
gates on Humphrey’s behalf. All
three men are set to begin a ‘‘mass
mailing’’ campaign for the ‘‘Draft
Humphrey’’ movement.

Could Humphrey get the nomina-
tion? The Minnesota Senator is 64;
some say he’s too old. Others feel he’s
definitely ‘‘over the hill’: his loss to
Nixon in ’68 and his failure to win the

Democratic nomination from Mc-
Govern in ’72 have branded him a
loser. Quite a few merely find him
boring. At least one American has
accused him of ‘‘diarrhea of the
mouth.”

Yet Humphrey seems to be gaining
support. The National Observer has
polled the delegates to the 1972
Democratic National Convention;
H.H.H. received 24.8 percent of the
vote compared to Udall’s 18.2 per-
cent, Carter’s 15.9 percent and Jack-
son’s 7.5 percent.

At a recent gathering of Democra-
tic mayors in New York City Hum-
phrey upstaged Carter, Jackson, and
Udall. In Philadelphia, they were
overshadowed by him. The state
AFL-CIO Convention in Pittsburg
echoed with cries of ‘‘We want
Hubert!”’

H.H.H. in ’76? It’s possible. As the
past has proven, anything’s possible
in the world of politics.

The latest Harris survey shows
Humphrey ahead except in the South,
among Protestants, and the young
he’s leading Carter by 53 to 40 percent
among Democratic voters.

Many delegates remain uncom-
mitted. Of the 65 in New York, at
least 50 are said to be Humphrey
supporters. Many other delegates
now committed to other candidates,
especially Jackson, are apparently
Humphreyites too.
