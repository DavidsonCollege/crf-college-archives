Rush Starts Tomorrow With F reshmen Visiting All Houses

By GREY PASH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Tomorrow marks the first
day of Davidson’s delayed
rush system, directed by the
Interfraternity Council.

Johnny Jeter, IFC Fush Com-
mittee chairman, pointed up the
importance of this rush period.
“T think that it is very import-
ant,” he said, “that we do our
best to make this new rush pro-
gram a success. The fraternity
situation is far from settled
with the faculty and adminis-
tration, and for the benefit of
the system we have to make
this rush work.”

A total of 271 freshmen will
be visiting on Patterson Court
for the first time tomorrow. In
order to enable the fraternities
to have organized parties, the
idea of an open house has been
abandoned in favor of fresh-
men’s being divided alphabetic-
ally into 12 groups of approxi-
mately 25 each.

Basically this is how the rush
schedule will go: Group I will
begin at the Kappa Alpha house
at 2 p.m., at 2:30 it will move
to the Bela Theta Pi house: it
will have its sixth and final
party of the first day’s rush at
4:30 at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house.

Group II will begin at the
_Reta Theta Pi house at 2 p.m.
and continue in the same fash-
ion. having the last party at the
Phi Delta Theta house.

IFC Hears
Dirty Rush
Charges

Two charges of “dirty rush”
and a decision on publication of
a.rush brochure were considered
by the Interfraternity Council at
its meeting Monday night.

The first charge was that a
number of the fraternity’s mem- '
bers were wearing name tags at
several homecoming activities
including the football game. This
specific event was not construed
to be an actual violation of the
rush regulations, but the frater-
nity was warned that name tags
should not be worn on such oc-
casions.

The most Serious charge
against the fraternity was that
a member invited a freshman to
eat with a group of fraternity
men in Charlotte on the Satur-
day night of Homecoming week-
end. The freshman declined that
offer. and he was therefore not
involved in the charge. The fra-
ternity was found guilty, or this"
‘charge and will “e fined $50.

Al Carson and Dave Perrin re-
ported that rather than publish- ;
ing a rush brochure, which they |
felt was unnecessary at this’
time, the IFC would print pocket |
name tag for rushees, The back,
of these vards will include a
rush’ schedule and a_ small
amount of pertinent information.

The council also considered
several topics introduced by As-:
sistant Dean of Students Tom
Covington. it voted in favor of
Tuesday afternoon dorm rush
but opposed the delay of accept-
ance of bids until after the
Christmas holidays.

Groups II-XII will begin and
proceed in a similar: manner
around the court. On Sunday,
Nov. 7, Group I will begin at the
Phi Delta Theta house, Group
II at the Kappa Sigma house,
etc.. with each group visiting
the six fraternities on the half
of the court that it did not visit
the previous week. Jeter urged
that freshmen’ be at the right
house at the right time, espe-
cially for the 2 p.m. parties.

Fraternity men will not pick
up freshinen at their dorm or
escort them from house to house
as has been done in the past.

Several changes in party sche-
ules and rush regulations were
made this week. The Faculty
Committee on Fraternities,
Clubs and Social Life met Tues-
day afternoon and approved sev-
eral recomendations made by
the IFC.

The first was approving Tues-
day afternoon dorm rush from
3 p.m. until 5 p.m. on Nov. 2, 9,
16 and 23.

The second change was the
moving of three Saturday rush
parties to Sunday. Parties pre-
viously scheduled for Nov. 6
will now be held on Nov. 7, Dec.
4 on Dec. 5, and Dec. 11 on Dec.
12.

Parties will be held on Oct.
30 and Nov. 13 as previously
scheduled.

In conjunction .with this
change, parties on Oct. 30 will
be from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. (six
30-minute parties), as will the
parties on Nov, 7.

The faculty
confirmed the IFC clarification

of parties on Freshman Par-!

ents Day on Nov. 13. There will
be no dates given as these will
be openhouse parties from 4

committee also.

p.m. until 6 p.m. with freshman
parents invited to attend. But
the IFC has set a lmit of 40
mihutes to the amount of time
a rushee may spend at any one
house on that date.

Finally, the faculty commit-

tee concurred with the Interfra-
ternity Council in rejecting the
Freshman Council proposal to
delay acceptance of bids until
shortly after return from Christ-
mas holidays.

Another exception is that be-

ginning with the first rush party,
freshmen and fraternity men
(pledge. member, alumnus)
may discuss fraternities on cam-
pus whenever it is legal for
a rushee and a fraternity man
to talk.

This of course does not ap-
ply to the periods of silence
which are: (1) at the end of
each open house or rush party
until 8 a.m. on the following
Monday morning (2) from Nov.
19 to Nov. 29. (3) Dec. 17, 1965

at 5 p.m. to Jan. 3. 1966 at 8
a.m. During these periods of.
silence, no fraternity man is al-
lowed to influence a rushee in
any manner.

Jeter, speaking for the IFC,
said “This program is new to

us; and we will be the first to
admit it. Theré is room for im-
provement, but a lot of thought
has gone into this rushing sys-
tem and we think that with
everyone's help, it will be a suc.
cess.”

Trustees Recommend Study

On Drinking Rule Change

Faculty Amendments
Will Remain in Effect

The Board of Trustees recommended further study
by the joint faculty-trustee committee on the new drink-
ing rule which was approved by the faculty at its meeting

earlier this month.

Thus, the new regulation
which permits Davidson § stu-
dents to consume .alcoholic bev-
erages at any time away from
the college campus remains in
effect.

Meeting on campus last Fri-
day. the Trustees reviewed the

| measures adopted by the faculty

on Oct. 12 after recommenda.
tions were made by the joint
Faculty-Trustee Committee on
Alcoholic. Beverage Policy.

The committee recommended
amendments which would have

Trustees Abolish Oath,
Institute New Policy

By FRANK FLEMING -

Davidsonian

Staff Writer

The Board of Trustees voted last Friday to abol-
ish the long-standing faculty oath that had prevent-
ed all non-Protestants from attaining the rank of

full professor.

In its place the administration and ‘Trustees now
have the authority simply to “satisfy themselves”
that a prospective faculty member is a Christian

before hiring him.

Since the real vote on the vow issue had been
taken in April, the Friday yote was simply a con-

firmatory formality. All
two separate votes.

Trustee changes require

The old oath, given to all who earned “tenure”
(full professorship), was a public confession affirm-
ing Christ as ‘Lord and Savior” and accepting the
Old and the Néw Testaments of the Bible as the —
“word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and

practice.”

The new oath requires only that the professor
profess Christianity. Thus for the first time faculty
positions are open to Roman Catholics. Also this
allows professors who had opposed the oath to gain
promotion to full professorships.

The Trustees conferred an honorary doctor of
laws degree on Dr. William Rule III, Class of ’32.
Rule has served as a Presbyterian medical mission-

ary in the Congo for the
President D. Grier

reports on the Ford Foundation drive and on the

Davidson Self-Study Program. The latter is part of
the evaluation required by the Southern Association
of Colleges and Universities.

The final business concerned revising the chart-
ter by-laws of the Trustees. According to Fred
Sackett, assistant to the president, this long-range
job “might take all year. It involves rewording some
parts and bringing other sections up to date.’

prohibited drinking at any
event in which student were
participating as representatives
of the college. Because the
faculty action_did not conform

to the committee suggestions.
the aniendments were subject to
review by the Trustees.

After considering the matter
the board recommended that the

joint committee study the mat-|!

ter further and pointed out sev-
eral. implications in particular
with which it was concerned,

Several questions were raised
about: the college's liability for
accidents involving students who!
should be drinking at off-cam
pus college functions.

Other questions were raised by
Trustees concerning the implica-
tions of the new rule involving
Social Council and athletic
events.

“When the proposal was pre-
sented, the many sides of the
situation had not been investigat-
ed thoroughly enough,” stated
one spokesman after the meet-
ing. ‘“‘The Trustees felt that the
joint committee should recon-
sider the matter in light of some
additional information,’’ he add-

ed.

Under the new ruling: students
are. still prohibited from con-
suming or being under the in-
fluence of an alcoholic beverage
while within the town limits of
Davidson or on the campus of
the college. which includes the
lake campus.

Otherwise students will be
bound by the ‘‘gentlemanly con-
duct’ clause of the faculty re-
gulations at any time,

The amendment also explicitly
permits the storing of alcoholic
beverages in the locked trunks
of student automobiles. Also, the
regulation concerning possession
and consumption within the town
do not apply to a student while
in the home of his immediate
family.

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The return of an unusual.
ly large number. of alumni
highlighted last weekend’s
Homecoming activities, hail-

ed a success by administra-

tion and student leaders
alike.

According to William L. Bon-
durant, director of alumni acti-
vitieés, about 2,900 people, in-
cluding alumni and their fam.
ilies and students and their
dates, took part in Saturday’s
pre-game barbecue.

Bondurant said that the num-
ber of returning grads was the
largest in recent years, an in-
dication of the ‘‘strong. positive
alumni reaction” to the Chal-
lenge Fund campaign.

“I am very impressed and

very pleased with the alumni’s . .

response.” he said. ‘‘So many
are anxious to help the College.
The alumni ‘are no doubt one of

the strongest assets we have."

Theobald Scrutinizes Problem
Of Cybernation, Unemployment

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Guaranteed income? Cy-
bernated society? Unem-
ployables? It seemed
Strange to hear a man who
so much resembled Kipling

re-incarnate talk in such
terms, but these were the
problems that Robert Theo-
bald, noted British socio-
economist, dealt with dur-
ing his two- day stay here,
from Tuesday until yester-
ay

His primary thesis was that
the increasing automation of our
society will soon make most
jobs of today obsolete. Many
people will simply be incapable
of doing any of the jobs that
remains. This problem can best
be handled by means of a con-
stitutional amendment guaran-
teeing everyone in the country
a minimum income.

“We have an increasing level

of unemployability,” claimed
Theobald. ‘‘The great problem
we have is that we are moving
into what I'll call a reverse leis-
ure society.

“The voint is that in the fu-
ture the people who can use
leisure won't have much and
those who can't handle it will
have a great deal.'' The only
acceptable solution is a guaran-
teed income, he felt.

The economist recognized that
there are many dangers inher-
ent in this course of action. How-
ever, “The question of incen-
tive is largely illusory.’’- Theo-
bald asked, “Is man someone
who has to be whipped into do-
ing something or is he capable
of rising to a challenge?” He
apparently believed the latter.

He also advocated giving the
present middle class a higher
guaranteed income than that
given to the laborers, since the
effects of cybernation are even

greater on the middle class, and
“‘we cannot allow either socially
or politicaly for these people to
drop to the bottom o! the lad.
der.”

A basic change in real values
is necessary to implement the
new society that Theobald pro-
poses. “‘We need," he said,
“much less competition and
much more cooperation.”

He added, “The very pecu-
liar aspect of today’s world is
that for the first time we must
start taking seriously what
Christianity has been saying for
centuries."

Wednesday night things really
got interesting. Theobald en-
gaged in a debate with Dr.
Stephen W. Rousseas of New
York University, and the fur
began to fly.

Dr. Rousseas, it seems. dis-
agrees rather strongly with Mr.
Theobald. At least one had that
impression when Rousseas saitl,
“I consider Mr. Theobald a

walking anachronism,” or later,
speaking of the guaranteed in-
come, “The naivete of this pro-
posal is beyond comment.”

It turned out to be a really
fascinating dialogue, although
both gentlemen spent a good
deal of time assuring one an-
other that they really didn’t un-
derstand each others’ terms or
hoping that now they were at a
point where they could begin
debate.

Rousseas' main differences
with Theobald were in his eval-
uation of the significance of au-
tomation.

He took the position that
“there is no scientific reason
to come to any conclusion that
automation is a serious threat.
Whether or not it becomes a
threat for the future is a po.
litical problem.”

In addition he predicted infla-
tion and an unfavorable balance
of payment as a result of the
guaranteed income.

his girl here would have have
had a good. time anyway — the
Social Council just made it that
much better. My date and sev-
eral others I talked.to were very
impressed with the activities.”

Added Rick Flinn, ‘‘The enter-
tainment had its good moments
—there was something to satisfy
anyone's tastes. The weekend
was . well-planned in that there
was something to do most of the
time. The opportunity for a good
time was there — it all depend-
ed on the individual’s desire to
enjoy it.’

“Homecoming didn’t seem
much of a holiday since most of
us didn’t get off campus. Since
there are only a few cars in our
class, most of us have been on
campus all year. All-in-all,
though, I thought it was a very
successful affair." Kim Nelson
remarked.

Mike Spann declared, “The
eating set-up was weak, I
thought. When you ask a girl
here, you want to be able to
treat her to better meals than
buffets and picnics.”

But would freshmen have been
better off in fraternities? Most
members of the Class of ‘69 ad-
mit that, never having been in
fraternities, all they can do is
speculate.

On this subject Dean Cromar-
tie said, “I think if we had been
in fraternities, most of the stags
would have had dates. That way
more people could have had a
good time.”

Frank Spence remarked, “‘In
many cases I suspect our part-
ies were better than the off-cam-
pus ones. Of course ours were
larger, and at a_ fraternity
party you can be with just your

: friends.”

Ik was a typical Homecoming
weekend, according to Mrs.
Nicholls. Only ‘faulty plumbing

Mrs. Gillespie did note one dif-
ference, however.

“This year all the girls were
real trim."’ she said. ‘I don't
believe I saw a fat one all week-
end.”

The Social Council, under the
direction of Jan Campbell,
spearheaded the social activities.
The council itself handled Sat-
urday morning's early breakfast.
the after-game cook-out and the
concert and combo party Satur-
day night.

The Union Social Committee
sponsored Friday’s Heaven and
Hell Dance, Artist Series hand-
led Friday's concert, and the
Alumni Association sponsored
the barbecue Saturday.

The Interfraternity Council
handled the queen and display
competition. Mrs. Brady Dick-
son, sponsored by Pi Kappa
Alpha, was crowned Homecom-
ing Queen by Penny Clark,
Miss North Carolina. Pi Kappa
Phi won the display contest.

‘From the comments I've got-
ten, I thought it was a very suc-
cessful weekend,” said Camp-
bell. “The council would like to
hear opinions and suggestions
for improvement.”

Richard C. Burts, dean of stu-
dents, echoed Campbell's en-
thusiasm in saying, “I think
there is a general happiness
over the event. It certainly
brought a lot of men back. I
guess the game was about the
only thing that went wrong”
