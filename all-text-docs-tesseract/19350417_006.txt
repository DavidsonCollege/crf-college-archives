Chemical Constitution Of Modern
Girl Analyzed By Doctors
At Albany

Associated Collegiate Press

Romance via the date bureau won't
work, at least at the University of Minne-
sota, for the much publicized bureau, set
up last fall, has folded up for lack of
patronage.

“People didn’t use ‘it,’ Jean Myers,
chairman of the bureau, declared. “There
is no use continuing Yt if students won't
support the bureau.”

Part of the difficulty inputting the
plan over was attributed to the resist»
ance which generally accompanies any
social innovation. The prejudice against
it could not be broken down, according
to the chairman. Students signed up for
dates in a joking way were partly re-
sponsible for its unsuccessful career, it
was pointed out.

WHO SAID, “SWEET

THING?”

College boys who think: the charming
co-eds they take out are sweet are about
to have a rude awakening from a false
illusion, for doctors at Albany Medical
College of Union University have
evolved the following chemical formula
for the young ladies of today.

YOUNG

One girl is made of enough glycerine
to furnish the bursting charge for one
naval shell. She has enough lime to
whitewash a chicken coop and she had
enough gluten to make five pounds of
glue. In addition she has enough sul-
phur to rid an ordinary dog of ‘fleas
and enough chlorine to three
good size swimming pools.

sanitize

In addition, she carries around every
day 30 teaspoons of salt, 31 pounds of
carbon and 10 gallons of water. Who
said “sweet young thing?”

not take so much effort,” spoke Redhead

at the chapel service Tuesday, “but there

is a way of being good without trying.”

Paul sums it up in unforgettable fash-|

ion: “We are all with unveiled face be-!

holding as in a mirror the image of

Christ,” and we-are transformed into the

same image.

“Character comes more by contagion)

than by conscious effort, and the secret!
of it is to live in spiritual relationships}
that do things to us.”
Rev. Redhead
speak upon “Playing the Game.” He
showed that everyone must play the’
game according to the rules and that
there are rules also in the moral uni-
verse. “If we don’t obey these rules,”
Redhead asserted, “then we'll be put out
of the game. We don’t break the moral
laws. They break us.”

Tuesday evening saw

“In the second place, what the world
needs is men who play the game accord-
ing to rules, whether it means win or
And third, the man who plays the
game according to the rules will in the
final outcome be found on the winning
side.”

This morning Redhead spoke on “Mak-
ing God Real.” He stated that we be-
gin knowing God as a formula of ex-
planation, but that it is up to one to
know lim as a fact of experience. We
cannot be satisfied with the beginning
kind of knowledge,” said Redhead in this
sermon. “It’s only a gateway through
which we pass to the second kind.”

The proof of the pudding is in the
eating: “O taste and see that the Lord
is good.’ He showed that God has a
private door in every heart—but too often
we leave the latchstring on the inside.

Redhead graduated from Southwestern
in 1926, receiving his B.D, and.Th.M.
degrees from Union Seminary in Rich-
mond. His record has stamped him. as
one of the outstanding young preachers
in the Southern Presbyterian Church.

He is now pastor of a Presbyterian
Church in Tampa, Florida.

dance, a University of Michigan (Ann

balance of the year.

were recently taken from their resting ¥
places under library tables at the Uni-|
versity of Florida (Gainesville).

Pursuit Of Knowledge
Declining In Germany

By Associated Collegiate Press

“The pursuit of knowedge in modern
Germany is on the decline,” Dr. Freid-
rich Wolfe, distinguished German play-
wright and refugee from Nazi Germany.
declared in an interview with the Sea-
wanhaka, Long Island University news-
paper. ;

As evidence of his statement, he cited
the fact that during the year there has
been a decline of thirty per cent in Uni-
versity enrollment, and the authorities

have declared this to be a favorable
sign.

“German officials believe that it is not
good taste to use one’s head too much,”
he said. Dr. Wolfe is at present visit-
ing universities and colleges here and at
the conclusion of his tour will go to Rus-
sia to supervise the production of one

of his plays.
