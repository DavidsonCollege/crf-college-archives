ission

The second notice was recently issued by the Honor Council and Dean Terry when it was brought
to their attention that some students are using fake Davidson College ID’s off campus:

-Use of any fake Davidson College ID (one with which someone has tampered or that of another
student or former student) on or off campus is false and improper use of an official college document and

receiving them from their advi-
sors. Freshmen met their advisors
early Friday afternoon and Drop/
Add began at four the same day.
Dean Terry agreed that the fresh-
man course selection was of con-
cem.

Students, both old and
new, agreed on the importance and
thoroughness of Orientation.
Schleafer enjoyed how Orienta-
tion “eased you into [Davidson
life],” even if specific panels and
lectures appeared tedious. Hall
counselors Rachel Dunifon and
Julie Petty recalled the long weck-
end as “hectic,” but felt.a balance
was attained between education

and fun.

Freshman Advisor David
Wang attributed the positive out-
come not only to outstanding orga-
nization by school officials, but to
the energetic attitude of the Fresh-
men class. According to most
people who have worked with the
freshmen over the past week, the
class of 1996 is an eager bunch,
ready to enjoy Davidson.
