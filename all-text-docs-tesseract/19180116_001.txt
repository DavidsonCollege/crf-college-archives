Reid Poole Gives
His Lite for Country

Was Candidate for the Ministry.
Died at Camp Jackson.

An announcement in chapel by Dr.
Martin on the morning of December 19
brought to us the first real impressive-
ness of the war. This was the news
that Davidson had given one son to the
cause of war, that “the war had actually
begun.” We partially realized that the
war was on last spring when so many
of our fellow students left for the train-
ing camps; but that solemnness which
must soon strike home to thousands in
America fell upon the Davidson stu-
dent body for the first time when the
death of David Reed Poole, ex-'19, was
announced. .

Reid was taken sick with spinal men-
ingitis on Friday, December 13. He had
been in’ perfect health, and his sickness
fell upon him suddenly. He contracted
the disease, it is thought, from nursing
a fellow soldier who had this deadly
disease. Death came on Sunday, Decem-
ber 15, after only two days’ illness. His
body was carried to Mocksville, N. C.,

D. R. POOLE, EX-'19

where it was interred the following

Wednesday.

To the Juniors, his fellow classmates,
and to his other fellow students there
is the familiar mental picture of the
great brawny student with cheerfulness
and determination written on his face.
For two years he roomed on South Wing
Chambers, and there made himself a
favorite. He was a diligent and faith-
ful student, and tried to make full use
of his opportunities at college.

Reid’s wonderful physique gave him
a sure bid, all thought, of making the
foothall team. He was really fond of
athletics, and in his high school days had
made a creditable showing in baseball.
But coming to college he found little
time to indulge in the sports. He played
guard on his class football team, and
showed considerable ability in putting
the shot and discus. But the seriousness
with which he took his studies bade him
neglect athletics.

Reid was a candidate for the minis-
try, and ane of the most zealous mem-
bers of she Ministerial Band last spring.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., JANUARY 16, 1918.

Service

Many Alumni and Students Have Entered Some Branch of Active
Service for Their Country.

This list is neither complete nor cor-
rect. We hear of new names nearly
every day and the men are shifted so fre-
quently that it is impossible to have a
correct statement of their location. Most
of these addresses were compiled in De-
cember, 1917.

It is a showing in which Davidson
College feels a deep pride, but it is proud
also of the hundreds of men who are
serving their country by doing their own
work well in their various spheres, and
of the young men now on the campus
who are preparing themselves for what-
ever needs the future may bring. In
many cases this is infinitely harder than
to enlist.

To the Davidson men who have enlisted
in war service:

My dear Fellows: In preparing che
lise of the students, past and current,
who have entered service in the world
war—which list appears in this copy of
Tire Davivsontax—we are mindful of
the fact that it is almost impossible to
get a complete roster. and doubtless there
are mistakes and many omissions. We
cent out a bulletin to all the Alumni ask-
ing that they give us the names of all
who have entered, but T fear a great
many have never been reported. Wher-
ever this list comes under the eve of
anv Davidson man, or friend of the col
lege, let him look it over and if there is
any error in his own record, or that of
any man contained in the list, or if there
is any omission which he can supply, it
will be a great favor to us if he will very
promptly send as detailed information
as possible. We are keeping a war cata-
log of Davidson men and we want to
make it as accurate as possible. It ‘is
even now helpful to us and. will be of
considerable importance in later -vears.
and may be a matter of great interest to
every man who has gonc into the service.
A copy of this Davinsonian is being
mailed to every man in the service whose
address we have and we hope it will
reach all of you. Later. we may get out
another one which will be more com-
plete and if the men will be interested
enough to send in all possible names and
addresses we shall be glad to send each
one a copy when we publish the new list.

Our Nation enters this war with
noblest aim and purpose. The college
realizes that you men have undertaken
a very serious business in responding to
the country’s call. While there is some-
thing of adventure to every young man
in an undertaking like this, the college
would urge every one of you to keep in
mind the true motives as sct forth by our
great President which compelled us to
go into this war, for, unless you do, the
busines becomes one of savage destruc-
tion only, and must be brutalizing in its
effects on the participants. It is our
earnest hope and praver for you all that
after you have rendered your full share
of service, acquitting vourselves as. men
(as we confidently know you will), you
will come back to the homeland safe in
life and limb. and sound in morals and
spiritual being.

One of your number, voung David R.
Poole, of the class of gig, is, so far as
we know, the first of the Davidson men
to give his life in the cause. He died
December 15, 1917. in Camp Jackson,
of pneumonia. Hf others of you are call
ed to lay down your life in this noble
cause, | pray that you may be ready to
meet Him who is the Judge of all the
earth, and find in Christ the Saviour of
your immortal souls. | believe it) was
General Leonard Wood who so admir
ably said that “it matters not so much
when we go as how we go,” and [ heart-
ily commend this sentiment to every one
of you.

May God bless and keep you all.

Names of Former Davidson Students Known to/Hon. M. R. Patterson

Speaks Friday Night

National Prohibition is Theme of
Speakers.

‘The Anti-Saloon League ot North
Carolina has announced that) the cam-
paign which is being conducted thru-
out the State inchides more than three
hundred speeches.

The Anti-Saloon League is now in the
midst of its campaign in] North Caro-
lina in behalf of national prohibition and
for law enforcement. Superintendent
Davis says that in this State-wide cam-
paign by National speakers, who’ will
make more than 400 speeches, it is the
purpose to give to our people full infor
mation as to national prohibition and
how we can help to accomplish it, as well
as what will be necessary to get. this
State to ratify. Thirty-six States, thru
their General Assembly, must ratify the
amendment before national prohibition
can become effective and altho it will
not be a very dificult thing to get 25
or even 30 States, it will be quite diff-
cult to get the 36. The liquor traffic

BX-COVERNOR PATTERSON

will do their utmost to hold at least onc
State and if in the seven years allotted
for the ratification of this amendment
thev should be successful in holding 13
of the 48 States, national prohibition
will not be accomplished at this time.
‘Therefore the urgent necessity of activ-
itv on the part of prohibitionists,

It is hoped that this campaign will
help to wake our people and officers up
on the necessity of law enforcement.
Mr. Davis savs. information recently
put out by Collector of Internal Reve:
nue Bailey that the revenue officers in
the State, in the last two months, cap-
tured over 600 blockade stills and that
in his opinion there are more than 4,000
such stills operating in the State, proves
that the Anti-Saloon League is not heat-
ing the air when we are urging law en-
forcement and proves further that some
of the State officers are derelict in their
duty. :

Davidson has been very fortunate in
the allotment of speakers that the anti-
Saloon League has made for us. Ex-
Governor Patterson, of ‘Tennessee, also
former member of Congress, is too well
known to need any introduction to our
