A New Slant -

With the release of first semester cut
figutes on chapel and vespers, a new light
has been thrown on an old question. In
spite of gripes and groans, over half
(53.4%) of the student body “forgot” to
take their allotted limit in chapel. Only
63 individuals overcut. Many reasons for
these embarrassing figures are available.
Dean Spencer mentioned a significant
evidence of student responsibility. An-
other prominent explanation rests in the
new approach to chapel by the adminis-
tration and students this year. Brief but
planned and pertinent worship services
with free communication of information
through announcements highlighted most
of these programs. Elimination of Monday
chapel also figured in the results. Most
of the student body were conspicuous by
their presence at vespers, also, with
only 25 students marked overcutting on
Sunday nights.

Regardless of the reasons involved.
these figures should present a very sig-
nificant revelation to the doubters from
“the Hill” to the M. & M., the pulpit to
the back pew percolators. Overcutting of
neither service is a serious problem, and
students can assume responsibility. There
must be something worthwhile in these
services. That many students can’t. be
wrong.

Student Responsibility--
A Tender Shoot

Not long ago, a seed was sown at Da-
vidson. It occurred right after a severe
cold spell, but the soil, on at least part of
the field, was fairly fertile. This little em-
bryo was entitled ‘‘student responsibility’
and came encased in what scholars called
“the liberal cut system.” According to in-
Structions on the package, every student
was allowed four cuts per course and five
cuts meant loss of quality points. As only
120 quality points plus a few major and
minor requirements were needed for grad-
uation, the decision on cutting rested
mainly with the student.

By now the seed has had almost three
months growth, but as we approach the
end of the term (toward judgment day),
life of the growing shoot has become en-
dangered. On behalf of its existence, it
would be worthwhile for us to evaluate
the title “student responsibility.”

The student is responsible to himself
for his education. Ask any pre-med apply-
ing to graduate school—any ROTC cadet
straining for a place on a selective com-
mission list—any business major up for
interview—what the value of his educa-
tion and background means in considera-
tion of the future. If he possesses a keen
conscience, he also feels responsible to
those who made college life possible for
him. Especially now, a student is responsi-
ble to his fellow comrades in culture, for
the continuance of this policy depends
entirely on the reaction to the system
this semester.

Perhaps it would be advantageous for
those on the danger line to reconsider the
various merits involved before turning off
the alarm and taking that fatal dive into
the sack. To those who have made them-
selves obnoxious by absences and have
flagrantly abused the system, a word of
caution. Such actions only sharpen the ax
that waits, in some places quite eagerly,
to cut down the shoot of increased liberali-
ty and responsibility that has been
planted. It would be a tragic fall indeed,
if the growing tree was felled because of
a few. .

Such a system cannot be expected to
mature smodthly into pictured reality
overnight, much in the same way that a
seed finds rough going in unworked soil.
The natural reaction to liberal limits is to
exercise the cut a little more. This does
not deny or destroy the principle involved,
however, that of education by initiative,
not compulsion, through desire to
obtain, not fear of restrictive punishment.

“See No Evil, Smell No Evil”
Equals Victorian Absurdity

Last Thursday night approxi-
mately eighty per cent of the stu-
dent body listened to the frater-
nity president read a pledge which
the officers of each fraternity
must sign on Monday after a col-
lege dance weekend. In brief, the
pledge reads that no drinking came
under the observation of the three
top officers throughout the three-
day festivities.

Each officer signs this and has
done so ever since dance week-
ends have been allowed on cam-
pus; by going through this formal
procedure the trustees and parents
and patrons of the college beam
to themselves smugly that at least
at Davidson there is no drinking on
a dance weekend as you find on so
many of the nation’s secular cam-
puses. All this form and fanfare
immediately reminds one of the
ostrich who sticks his head in the
ground to protect himself from
danger and disturbance. By ob-
serving this prescribed ritual, our
feathered friend blocks out all
communication with reality and
lays himself open to any real
danger which might be present.

Hiding from « known fact just
to be able to say that it doesn’t
exist, however, is sheer folly.

The fraternity officers can sign
the “sacred pledge of blindness”
because, in truth, they have seen
no signs.of drinking during the
week-end. Why? The answer is
evident: They are forced by a
Victorian rule to remain aloof
from any sociol activity that tekes
place off the premises of the cem-
pus.

The administration evidently be-
lieves that by having the officers
sign such a pledge (and hence
keeping them from attending any

‘off-campus parties just so they can
place their names on the “purity —

sheet") that it has performed a great
and worthy service for all con-
cerned,

In a recent poll of the student
body it was found that fifty per
cent of the students drink, and that
another twenty-six per cent do not
object to other people’s drinking.
Carrying this to its logical con-
clusion, .we might state that over
three-fourths of the fraternity of-
ficers do not object to drinking
and that of these over half would
Uke to be able to attend their
respective fraternity’s party after
the dances. Under the present
set-up they cannot do so and still
sign the pledge which awaits their
signature on Monday morning.

What does the college think that
it has accomplished by keeping the
officers away from a place where
they logically belong and by pre-
venting them from taking part in
any of the extra social affairs
which take place on a Davidson
dance week-end? I feel that the

The Mailbag:

Correspondence

Dear Editor:

* Consistently, Gilbert Gragg
proves to be one of the most con-
troversial issues on the Davidson
campus. Since he began writing
articles in the Davidsonien some
time ago, he has been the subject
of many letters to the editor as
well as editorials in the paper.

- However, I have as yet to see
an article praising him for the
good he has done by bringing to
light a new viewpoint on many
important issues and drawing to
the attention of the student body
existing issues of which they were
not aware. His work has been dili-
gent and in many respects
courageous because he has not
been afraid to express his honest
opinion on very controversial
topics. His style is a refreshing
change from the methodical exact-

signing of the pledge does no one
any good, but that, in reality, only
helps to weaken the rules which
the college is trying to uphold. 1
am not in favor of throwing the

campus open to an alcoholic orgy —

but feel that the administration is
forcing a pledge upon a segment
of the student body (which is ab-
surd and unfair in its very make-
up).

If the college wants to have an
effective rule it could restate the
pledge whereby the officers would
only have to pledge that théy had
seen no drinking on campus. I
don't feel that any of the students
would feel that this rule would be
unfair, and I believe that much
could be done toward improving
present student-faculty relations by
so revising the present rule.

There is also one thore anti-
quated rule which should be
scrapped along with the above, and
that is the ruling by the adminis-
tration that each fraternity is al-
lowed only one function during the
semester. I am not in favor of
having functions ad infinitum but
do feel that fraternities should be
allowed to have group parties on
college dance weekends. At present,
if a fraternity wishes to meet
somewhere after a dance it must be
a private “birthday party” or the
like which has been arranged by
one or two individuals in a group
who just happen to issue “invita-
tions” to all of their fraternity
brothers who just happen to accept
and be there with their dates at a
given time.

Under the present ruling I am
heartily in favor of such skirting
of the law since I feel the rule
concerning only one function is en-
tirely unreasonable and lays itself
open to being circumvented by
various and ingenius methods. The
reason I am attacking this latter
rule is due to the fact that fra-
ternity funds (which should -be for
the purpose of such parties) are
now tied up and that the money
for such “birthday parties” must
come out of the _ individual's
pocket and not the fraternity’s. I
do not believe it to be fair or
justifiable to limit fraternity ex-
penditures in this way.

If the college will not change
the present above-mentioned rules
I feel that. the student body is at
least entitled to an explanation
for keeping these laws on record
and what the administration feels
that it is accomplishing by closing
its eyes to the true situation as
it now exists. I sometimes feel that
once a law gets on the books it
stays there because no one neither
thinks about it nor wishes to take
the time to change. it. Such an
enigma is not only absurd but
deplorable.

ness of many editorials and

articles.

In appreciation for his work, Mr.
Gragg has received nothing but
personal criticism from the David-
son students who have written
about him. Rather than examining
his articles for their validity, the
students prefer to criticize Mr.
Gragg as a personality and to at-
tempt to disqualify what he has
to say on the basis of this.

Perhaps if we all spent more
time considering the arguments on
both sides of the issues facing Da-
vidson students today and less time
criticizing the people who put forth
these arguments, we would come
closer to solving the problems in-
volved in these issues.

Going National:

Student Council To Affiliate

With U.

A great many men here at David.
son are concerned that the Student
Council has tended to be nothing
more than an Honor Council in
function.

These men, including the mem-
bers of the present Council, have
been anxious for a wider interest
and participation in a process of
Student Government, which would
serve as an effective organ of stu-
dent opinion, would acquaint us
with what fellow students are do-
ing on a state, national and even
international level, and would pro-
vide every man here with a voice
in questions involving students
which might arise at each of these
levels,

Consequently, the Council has
taken steps to affiliate our gov-
ernment with the United States
National Student Association, an
organization embracing schools alt
over the country, including, in our
area, the University of North Caro-
lina, Duke Woman's College, Guil-
ford College, Agnes Scott, Ran-
doiph-Macon, WCUNC, and Greens-
boro College. ,

Locally, the Student Council
feels that through the literature,
conferences, and personal contacts
which this organization will pro-
vide, Davidson may profit by an
influx of ideas tried and proved
at other member schools. To in-
sure the careful consideration of
these ideas and the adoption of
suitable ones for our own use, an
NSA co-ordinator will be named,
who will channel information into
several large committees, com.
posed of members of the student
body and presided over by a mem-
ber of the council. By studying
these proposals and making recom-
mendations, a great many more
men will have a voice in their own
government, and, consequently, the
student voice will assume much
larger proportions in the de-
termination of policy by the coun-
cil and, conceivably, also, by the
administration. The NSA _ plan,
then, seems to provide the basis
for a more ‘intelligent, and in-
formed type of local student gov-
ernment which will have to be
sensitive to student opinion.

NSA, as stated above, is a nation-
al organization. Through member-
ship in it we could lend our voice
of concern on matters common to
ali American students. This uni-
fied voice of students has been suc-
cessful in the past few years in
placing pressure in the U. S. Con-
gress on matters such as draft de-
ferment, tex reduction for parents
of college students, and increased

The

Many persons, both student and
faculty, in the past few weeks have
been quite concerned about what
is to happen to the YMCA at David-
son College now that the Associa.
tion has left the ‘‘automatic” basis
for its membership and has de-
cided to turn to the “voluntary”
basis of membership. They have
wondered what. it will mean in
terms of the kind of program and
indeed, the type of membership
which we will have.

Man does not automatically, by
virtue of his existence or presence
in a given situation, commit him-
self to a cause or movement. He
must make some conscious affirma-
tion to the reality which confronts
him; he must align himself with a
movement or group by virtue of
his agreement with the principles
or purposes which are set forth.

This is the basis on which the
YMCA will seek to enlist its mem-
bers next year. It will seek a con-
scious commitment from students
to the purpose of the YMCA—"a
fellowship of students and faculty
united by a common loyalty to God
through Jesus Christ.”

The central fact about the
Christian Association is that it has
within its structure and purpose
the potential to become a meaning-
ful Christian community. Emil
Brunner, the famous Swiss theolo-
gian, has said that the YMCA re-
sembles the reality signified by
the Church at least as much as to-
day’s so-called churches. “For the
Church is nothing else than a
brotherhood of: people bound to-
gether with Jesus Christ and with
each other by the Holy Spirit and
leading their daily life in such
fellowship.”

Dr. Brunner goes on to say, “If
therefore the members of a
YMCA by their faith are really
united with Christ, and if the love
which Is flowing out of this faith

unites them with the fellow mem. °

immigration privileges for foreign
students. ;

Each summer NSA conducts a
National Congress for the formu-
lating of policies and for sharing
of problems and achievements of
member councils. A convention
for Student Council Presidents is
conducted annually. The ideas
gained at these two national con.
ventions would undoubtedly pro-
vide stimulus for the broadening
of our Student Government’s func-
tions and for prodding us to aware-
ness on problems of national sig-
nificance facing students.

NSA provides an Information
Center on some 150 areas concern-
ing Student Government problems
and projects. The files of the Cen.
ter would be at our disposal on
matters such as election procedure
and effective communication
methods between Student Govern-
ment and the student body.

It is highly interesting to know
that NSA has been granted Ford
Foundation funds for the past two
years. These funds have been used
te sponsor national polls, to gather
statistical data, and to delve into
problems common to all Student
Governments.

In addition to the national set-up
there is a regional organization.
We fall into the Virginia-Carolina
Region. The function of the re-
gional organization is to further
provide a sharing organ through
its annual conferences and several
projects. .

Early in March the Student Coun-
cil became interested in the possi-

bers whom they “feel as brethren,
and if these members regard their
activities as service to Christ and
to the brethren and sacrifice their
lives in this service, they are the
Church as well as any church.”
The YMCA at Davidson, there-
fore, has within it the potentiali-
ties for becoming a Christian com-
munity within the broader com-
munity of the College. It can be
a fellowship which is truly a com-
munity of love, of love poured out
in response to the love of God in
Christ and pointed in three direc-
tions: toward God in Christ, to-
wards the members of this fel-
lowship, and toward the communi-
ty at large. Within this kind of a
community all persons are seen
as equals with no barrier drawn
in respect to status or opinion.
The “Y,”" as this Christian com-
munity, has several important
functions. First of all, the most
important task is to witness to
Jesus Christ, his transforming love
in all of life, to make Him known
to all men. It is not important
whether this witness is made by
the spoken word or whether it is
made in living action, through
service to people. What . matters
only is the aim that young people
come into a living contact with
Christ.
“~ This, however, can only happen
if the members of the Christian
community are living Christians
and if they have a living spiritual

The soul of the YMCA cannot live

bilities of NSA. Before spring holl-
days the Student Council, together
with the class officers and other
interested persons, entertained an
NSA delegation consisting of stu-
dents from Carolina, WC, and
Greensboro College. As a result of
the presentation of NSA’s program
and the discussion which it pro-
voked, the Student Council agreed
to look further into NSA through
a commitee composed of Clyde
Robinson (chairman), Clark Reed,
Tom Newton, and Vernon Hunter.

The committee studied the Na-
tional Constitution, Preamble, Re-
gional Constitution, and summary
report of the 1954 National Con-
gress. It further looked into the
practical applications of member-
ship in NSA at Duke, WC, Caro-
lina, Greensboro College, and
Agnes Scott. With that background
of study in hand the committee
then grouped the advantages of
NSA into two sections. The first
concerned the benefits of our own
campus. The second covered the ad-
vantages which we would gain by
belonging to a national student or.
ganization. Some of the major
points in these two groups are sum-
marized in the first two sections
of this article.

This information was ‘presented
by the committee to a group of
thirty students (non-Student Coun-
cil members) early in April. Al-
though the group had no official
authority, it went on record unani-
mously in favor of the Student
Council’s taking the necessary
action to affiliate with NSA after
the Student Body had been duly
informed of the proposed action.

The Student Council had taken
the recommendations of the com.
mittee and the student cross sec-
tion—both unanimously in favor of
NSA—and has passed a motion
which will officially affiliate the
Davidson Student Government
with NSA effective upon publica-
tion of this article.

This affiliation simply means
that we have ratified the national
constitution and preamble, and the
regional constitution, and have
agreed to pay dues amounting to
$34 per year, We are bound to aec-
cept nothing and to act in no way
‘contrary. to our own desires. We
merely receive suggestions and
have an opportunity to voice our
opinions through our delegates to
the National and Regional Confer-
ences. The organization is
thoroughly democratic, offering us
a wealth of opportunities, yet in
no way infringing upon our
autonomy.

‘Y’-A Christian Community

is also a community of worship,
.of study, of service, and of action.
Worship is central to the life of
the Association and certain times
must be set apart for the members
to gather for corporate devotion
of God. But this worship is not to
be seen as the Divine Service;
rather, the daily life of the in-
dividual Christians, who dedicate
their lives to God as sacrifice, ex-
plicitly receive this title of divine
service.

Secondly, study must play an
important part in the life of the
student Christian Association be-
cause as Christian students we see
our primary vocation as one of
studentship. Therefore, we must be
concerned to search for the truth
wherever it may be found, be it in
Bible study, the study of Christian
faith and heritage, or in the natural
or social sciences.

Thirdly, the function of service
is seen to be aimed at directing
our love of God to persons both
within and without the community,
seeking to perform those tasks
which’ will be of aid and edifiea-
tion to others.

Lastly, the Christian Association
has the function of action. It must
seek to make relevant the dynamics
of the Christian faith to its place
in the world. As a responsibly in-
volved community in the world it
will try to act in ways which will
seek the transformation of insti-
tutions and society according to
the law of love which Christ by His
life and death showed us.

The YMCA at Davidson College
has a tremendous potential for
the future. Its student leadership
is strong, faculty participation is
active and interested, the student
constituency is waiting expectant-
ly ... and all point to the fact
that the YMCA has an extraordi-
narily good chance to serve Christ
effectively in the years to come.

Rumple Renovation
Demands Priority

The recent revelation by Dr. Cunning.
ham of the plan for the restoration of the
original quadrangle has been very favora-
bly received by members of the student
body and friends of Davidson College.
The Board of Trustees has had plans in
writing for some time now for this
project. However, the time is rapidly ap-
proaching when these plans which have
remained dormant for so long should
be put into operation. No plan, no matter
how good, is of value unless carried out.

With the completion of the new W. H.
Belk Hall and the removal of Georgia
Dormitory (scheduled for this summer),
ithe dormitory situation here will be
bright except for one dark corner,
Rumple. This building, constructed in
1901, is a very dangerous firetrap and
is also rapidly deteriorating from a physi-
cal standpoint. Its removal or complete
renovation is a project which should no
longer be put offvas it has the potential of
causing a major disaster on the campus.
Unless some donor should specifically
earmark funds for the restoration of the
old quadrangle, the college officials
should direct first their attention to the
more important project, the replacement
of Rumple Dormitory.

However, the restoration of the old
quadrangle is a project which has also
been put off too long. In the eyes of this
writer no problem other than the dormi-
tory question should merit more atten-
tion.

FINE ARTS CENTER

It is the hope of many that this may
be known as the Woodrow Wilson Fine
Arts Center and may be completed in
time for the 100th anniversary of Wil-
son’s birth next year. Wilson’s first pub-
lic speech was made in the Eumanean
Literary Society Hall, a building which
will form an integral part of the Center.

The project would include removing
the hideous stucco from Shearer Hall
and the facing of the building toward the
church. In addition if the building is to
be used by the music department, as is
suggested, it should certainly be com-
pletely renovated and modernized in the
interior.

Also included in the plan is the re-
moval of the fire-house red paint from
the literary society halls and the casting
of these buildings into permanent form.
Completing the restoration would be the
construction of the “twins” to Oak and
Elm row, which formed part of the
original quadrangle.

UNSATISFACTORY FACILITIES

It is proposed in the plan for these
buildings to house the music, art, drama,
and speech departments. However,
Shearer Hall would have to be provided
with several additional floors if the facili-
ties of the Music Department alone are to
be adequately cared for (see editorial by
Austin Strand, The Davidsonian, Friday,
-April 15). These buildings could not under
any stretch of the imagination contain
the facilities needed for the art, speech,
and drama departments.

FINE ARTS BUILDING

We would therefore propose that a
companion building, constructed in the
same neo-classic style, be constructed
across the street in the location now oc-
cupied by the cardboard village. Not only
would this beautify an otherwise ugly
spot, but it would allow the architects to
build a building of the proper size to ac-
commodate the facilities of the four de-
partments as the architects and planning
experts would determine the need. It
would seem that only with such a build.
ing could we have a real Fine Arts Center,
one which would adequately handle the
departments involved.

Another long range plan of the Trus-
tees, but which has not been recently re-
vealed is the restoration and enlargement
of Carolina Inn for use as a guest house.
Here again we have the restoration of an
historic building for a practical use, one
for which it was originally constructed.
