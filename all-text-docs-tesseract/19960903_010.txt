Movie Review

Not

really
a fan

By EmiLy SIMMONS

Arts & Living Editor

When | got back from Ger-
many in August, I was really
looking forward to seeing all
the movies I missed while I was
away plus all the hot summer
flicks still playing.

I was a little disappointed,
though, when I found out that
everything was just a rehash of
all the old jingoistic action/ad-
venture, stupid comedy, adult-
becomes-kid crap that it always
was (with of course two Disneys
to choose from as well).

I thought that the one ex-
ception might be The Fan with
the usually decent Robert
DeNiro. Well, it wasn’t any
good. I mean, how many times

can DeNiro play the psycho-

who-doesn’ t-at-first-appear-to-
be-psycho-but-really-is-psycho
psycho? He just didn’t perform
up to par, besides the fact that I
heard that Wesley Snipes
wanted to be the psycho and
probably would have done a
better job given the fact that
once you’ ve done something a
few times it becomes blasé and
clichéd.

Snipes plays baseball
player Bobby Rayburn — a re-
ally good player making the big
bucks who hits a slump — and
Robert DeNiro is his die-hard
fan who supports him through
it all.

DeNiro is a down-on-his-
luck salesman who in the same
day loses his job and the right to
see his son after leaving the
child at a baseball game.

DeNiro also used to
play baseball as a child, and it
seems he is a bit bitter about
never making the big leagues.

DeNiro ends up in Snipes’
house with Snipes’ clothes on
and then steals Snipes’ car and
child. Of course his son is the
most important thing in the
world to Snipes, so it’s a big
ordeal, and of course all DeNiro
wants is for Snipes to hit a
homerun FOR HIM — other-
wise the kid’s dead. Pretty ex-
citing so far, huh?

Well of course there’s a
twist in the end where DeNiro
proves his true psychoness and
he gets terminated and the kid
lives and justice prevails and
good ‘old non-psycho Ameri-
can basebail wins. You know,
DeNiro needs to get a new line
and America needs to get anew
deal. Seriously.

A Fresh Perspective

A first year student assesses her orientation experience

By JENNY CORKE
Staff Writer

Freshman orientation has been
a rather bittersweet experience. I
have longed to leave home and go
to college ever since I got into
Davidson, and yet I cried when I
actually did leave. I arrived here
with expectations of freedom and
anew beginning, and then realized
that this combination can be some-
what overwhelming.

Isuppose it is easier to enjoy a
major life change when it exists as
only an abstract moment in the
future, rather than right now and
right here.

But aside from my own
quickly diminishing feelings of

uncertainty, I think that Freshman
Orientation has been a very excit-
ing welcome for the Class of 2000.
From the Olympics to the Fresh-
man Cake Race, we have had a
whirlwind of fun activities. Some
Freshman have admitted that they
could really use a week of vacation
after such a hectic week, while
others have said that are only ready
for more adventure.

One thing I think that we can

probably all agree on, however, is

that we have loved being treated
like incoming royalty.

The warmth of the reception
from Davidson staff and upper-
class students has truly been in-
credible. As my roommate says,
“the people here make me feel
right at home.”

Atthis pointit is hard to create
a big picture out of what I have
experienced so far. At first I al-
most felt as though I was placed in
a foreign land without a map, and
told to find my way around, and to
meet new people. People would
introduce themselves to me, and I
would try to register their names
and faces in my long term memory,
but eventually, my mind would
becomeajumble. Eventually, how-
ever, even this feeling of social
disorganization began to improve.
After several social events, includ-
ing hall mixers, concerts, and ice
skating, I finally feel as though I
am in a familiar place with people
that I can say "hi" to by name.
What a relief!

Right now, as I look forward

to classes, to homework, and to
various other aspects of college
life, I still feel a little nervous. The
initial butterflies have disappeared,
but a fear for the unknown still
remains. But then I suppose col-
lege is supposed to be a strength-
ening experience --'a time to dis-
cover who you are and what you
canachieve as an independent. The
great writer Ralph Waldo Emerson
once said that “What lies behind us
and what lies before us are small
matters compared to what lies
within us.” Being a Freshman is all
about discovering who you are and
how you will develop when left to
your own device. And I guess it is
also about realizing that there is a
world beyond your hometown and
outside of your comfort zone.

Getting loopy at Lupie’s

Restaurant in Charlotte feeds hungry faces with success

By Dax Cross
GuestWriter

On Friday after class, I re-
turned home only to be whisked
away to Charlotte to eat by three of
my friends. As my stomach knot-
ted up in the car, begging for food
and emitting various and sundry
grumbles and groans, I began to
curse my decision to drive for half
an hour before satisfying its crav-
ing. I, however, was on my way to
Lupie’s, a trendy burger and chili
joint to which I had never been.
Therefore, I slowly cast away

thoughts of the turmoil in my stom-

ach and began to grow excited
about the prospect of dining at a
new restaurant outside of Davidson

“overbearing.

and Cornelius, two towns not re-
vered for their cuisine.

Irealized that Lupie’s was my
kind of place at first sight. It is a
small brick building with a mural
painted on one wall and fancy
wrought-iron burglar bars over its
small and dusty windows. It re-
sembled the typical unpublicized
greasy spoon with little atmosphere
but fantastic food.

Upon entering the restaurant,
I was surprised to note that my
original assessment was way off
base. This bar and grill had a nice

laid back atmosphere which was :

pleasant and comfortable yet not
The high ceilings
and exposed ventilation (a popular
style at many new and trendy res-

taurants) allowed for a spacious
feel that often eludes small restau-
rants. This place was indeed much
classier than a greasy spoon, but I
could sense where its true roots
were. '

Our sweet tea came out to us
in Po Folks style jars, which I took
to be another good sign about the
place. The menu was not expan-
sive, but certainly would satisfy
most customers. Lupie’s specialty
is chili, served three styles, but the
only one that called me was a spicy
Texas chili, homemade with all the
rightingredients. The burgers, too,
looked appetizing, and Lupie’salso

_had a wide assortment of sand-

wiches, salads and vegetables. The
language of the menu led me to

believe that I would not leave the
place hungry.

Afteralarge order of hot wings
that lived up to their name, Iquickly
downed a couple of jars of tea
which were promptly refilled by
our server, who was efficient, pro-
fessional and ready to please us,
even though she was currently at-
tending to eight tables. All of us
were impressed by the quality of
the service as a whole,

We were especially grateful
when she brought out our food. As
I stared at an enormous hamburger
on aplate piled high with chips and
accompanied by a heaping dish of
mac and cheese, Iknew that] would
