Star freshman on his way out of Davidson

"I owe it to myself to move to a higher level...”

By JOHN BURNS

Is Davidson’s hot-shooting
guard really transferring? The
intrepid sports. staff of The
Davidsonian wanted to know for
sure, sO we went right to the
source. The following is a tran-
script from an: interview con-

ducted with Bruce Elder Tuesday
night.
Davidsonian: Bruce, we've

situation here is bad, I really love
Davidson, I have no regrets about
choosing here. But, it’s just that I
have a chance to play at a higher
level and in front of 10,000-
15,000 people in a conference
like the SEC or ACC.
Davidsonian: There was a
special on you in the Charlotte
Observer recently in which you
basically said that you came to

says that you son for
will wait to chang-
make your ing, do
decision. you think
What is the your de-
situation? cision to

Elder: I transfer
feel obligated will be
to wait until a per-
new coach is aesiinainaie _ ceived as
named, to Freshman Bruce Elder likely to transter 4 contra-
give him the diction
courtesy of of that

hearing him out and seeing who it

is. I told Kit Morris I’d do that.
Davidsonian: If we get acoach
that you are happy with, or one
thht brings a possible conference
affiliation, shtion develop, would
you stay here?

Elder: I really can’t answer
that right now. I know that not a
lot of progress has been made on
the conference affiliation, and
even if we were to get in a confer-
ence I have been told that it would
take one to two years to apply and
get reinstated. By that time I'd be
a junior or a senior.

Mainly it’s not so much that the

statement?

Elder: Basketball is my main
reason for changing. I decided
when I started looking to transfer
that I was not going to make an
academic sacrifice. I would only
go to an institution where I would
get comparable academics. And
the schools that I am dealing with
are of that caliber. I don’t feel bad,
because they get the same type of
kids as Davidson, they’re going to
be similar academically and so-
cially, and I can fit in at any of the
places that I am looking at as well
as get a good education and play

big-time basketball.

Davidsonian: So you will be
happier as just a player in the SEC
or ACC rather than one of the top
players in the Sun Belt, for in-
stance.

Elder: I think so. I think I can
really make an impact on the
SEC. Some of the coaches that I
have been talking to feel I can
make an impact on the ACC as
well. I can be a solid starter in a
program of that caliber. One of
my main talents is being able to
exploit the talents of other very
good players. I can help them be
better...I can be better able to use
that talent at Vanderbilt or a place
like that.

It’s tough to go out to games
where there are not_a lot of fans
or...apathy. I think one winning
year can turn that around here.
But I think I owe it to myself to
move to a higher level to see what
Ican do there. I view it as a chance
to move from a good situation to a
better situation. A situation, I
guess, more conducive to a really
good team and great fan support.
Davidsonian: Exactly which
schools are you looking at?

Elder’ Vanderbilt has offered
me.a full scholarship. Wake For-
est offered me a scholarship to-
day. Duke ‘has shown interest, I
will be talking to Virginia later on
this week...

Davidsonian: Must be nice.

Elder: Itis nice to get the atten-
tion. A few more schools have
shown interest but those are the
main ones that I’m looking at. I’d
say Vanderbilt is still my first
choice right now. Wake Forest is
a very attractive offer.

Davidsonian: What do you
think of Bob Staak’s situation?
Have you heard the rumors?

Elder: (laughing) That’s one of
the things I’m worried about,
yeah, I’ve heard the rumors. I
really don’t think it’s fair for me
to judge anything because I don’t
know enough about the
situation....But it’s something to
think about.

I know the new coach, I know
Dave Odom, not personally, but
he ran one of the camps I at-
tended. I know their top assistant,
Gerry Wainright. He was at the
same camp. I would never ques-
tion their ethics or their integrity.
That’s not really a big problem
there.

Wake Forest is very attractive,
but at this point Vanderbilt is
probably a little more attractive.
I’m going to visit Wake next week
though.

I won’t make any final deci-
sions until I get all the informa-
tion that I can, but the way I look
at it right now is, I can’t lose from
this point. I’ve gotten some really
attractive offers -- I can’t go
wrong. —

Davidsonian: Did your high
school coach have any effect on
this decision? He did say that
itwasn’t a good situation for a
freshman to lead a team like you
have» done. ‘Shortly after: that
Statement was released, people
began to talk of you Jeaving.

Elder: No, no that didn’t have
anything to do with it really. I had
talked with him about it, but
Coach Barfield was never one to
try to influence a decision I made.
He’s like my parents, he wants me
to be happy. He’d never push me
good range on his jump shot. He
shoots the ball well for a big man
and is fairly mobile for a big man.
I haven’t seen him play for over a

year, almost a year and a half. So,
I’m not in a good enough position
to evaluate him.

Davidsonian: What will they
do with your scholarship?

Elder: I have no idea. I would
guess that will be left up to the
new coach. I had heard that they
had gotten in touch with a kid
from Marietta, my hometown.
They told him that should I decide
to leave they’d have a scholarship
for him. But he has since signed.

With the coaching job vacant
now nobody’s really in a position
to say what thy are going to do
with it.I assume that they'll wait
and try to get a player who they
will really recruit. They would
probably like to get a player now,
but it’s just so late. Again, it’s up
to whomever the new coach will
be.

Davidsonian: What was your
opinion on Hussey’s decision, or
what was your opinion of Hussey?

Elder: I really had no problem
with Coach Hussey. He always
helped me out whenever I asked
him. He was always very suppor-
tiveof me. I had no problems.

As far as the situation of his res-
ignation, obviously, I sympathize
with him. I also understand the
Situation he was in. This is a tough
j recruiting sell for anyone.

You..can never question how
hard the man worked or how
much it meant to him. He spent
long hours. It was not for lack of
effort that things didn’t work out.
He was always trying to find ways
to improve the season. I think it
may just have been a combination
of bad timing and bad luck. And,
that’s all really I can say about it.

Davidsonian: Thank you.

Elder: All right, no problem.

couldn’t beat golf team

A1988-89 season recap

By JAY CHAUDHURI AND GATES
GRAINGER

The underpublicized Davidson College
golf team recently completed a fairly suc-
cessful spring campaign. Leading the team
were Craig Carlock, Chris Fiore and Gates
Grainger. Supporting the them with consis-
tently solid play were Scott Prince and
Craig Leonard.

The schedule started March 4 at Char-
leston, S.C. With horrendous weather, the
scores for the entire field were high. Fiore

led the Cats with rounds in the low 80s as

Davidson finished 12th out of 15 teams.
Soon after the Charleston tournament,
the team got serious and played better. At
Spartanburg, Fiore shot 78 and 74 to lead
the Cats. Grainger shot 80 and 76, and
Carlock shot two 80s to support the team.
Overall, the team finished. 7th out of 15

teams, and shot the fourth lowest score the

second day. Fiore’s round included birdies
on four of the fifth holes, while Grainger
took only 27 putts to salvage his score from
the trees. Leonard also came through with
a 78 focused around a back 36.

At the Virginia Commonwealth Univer-
sity Tournament in Richmond, Grainger ,
picked up his game. A first round 75 put

~ him in fifth place. Davidson stood in 15th

place out of 17 teams. The second round
featured bitterly cold temperatures and 30
m.p.h. winds. Nevertheless, Grainger fash-
ioned an 80, and the rest of the team fol-
lowed with solid rounds, including Prince
with an 83.

Davidson ended up 17th out of 20'in a
tournament with exceptionally strong
teams which included Virginia Common-
wealth University, Duke and Maryland. -
Davidson did manage to defeat old South-” °
em Conference rival Appalachian State.
Camp Lejeune, the Marine base in
Jacksonville, North Carolina, was the loca-
tion for the Cats’ next tournament.
Davidson put in a solid performance for the
three days with a 317-313-317,

The second day’s score resulted from
Fiore, Carlock and Grainger, all shooting —
