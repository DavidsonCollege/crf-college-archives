‘STUD’ STORE GROWS
IN SIZE AND SALES

Sales For the Current Year Al-
most Double Those of
Last Year

PROFITS TO LOAN FUND

Store Established About 12
Years Ago

The Student Store has been
steadily growing in importance
since its ‘establishment on the
Davidson campus until now the
business done reaches an ap-
paling figure. It was an-
nounced by the managers that
this year’s sales to date ap-
proximately double those of
last year.

The store was established about
twelve years ago in a vacant room
in Rumple dormitory; It was com-
pletely owned and operated by sev-
eral students, and worked on the
honor system. This went on for
about two years, then the store
was abolished by the executive
committee because of a serious mix-
up in finances.

The néxt year the store was mov-
ed into the building which it occu-
pies at present. One» half of the
building was used for the sales
while the other half was occupied
by the manager of the store.

The managers now work on a
salary plan, and all money made by
the store goes into the student loan
fund. The established fund was
to be consolidated at such time as
there was enough to purchase a
swimming pool for the students, but
it is hoped now that pool will come
from another source.

Each year the managers are
elected by a committee composed
of the college treasurer, college
auditor, president of the student
body, representative from the Stu-
dent Athletic Association, and a stu-
dent councilman. There are two
managers at present, Stuart Barnes
and Hal Overton, and fourteen ‘or
fifteen clerks.

The enormous business done is
exemplified by the fact that 645
cases of Coca-Cola were sold dur-
ing the 1936 year.

‘BUCK’ CURRIE CLOSES
Y’ SERVICES SUNDAY

Sunday Vespers Last in “Liv-
ing With Christ as Pat-
tern” Series

‘CALVARY TRUE WEALTH’
Explains Life’s Law of Vicar-

ious Sacrifice

Reverend “Buck” Currie conclud-
ing his stay in Davidson Sunday
evening by preaching at vespers.
At this time Rey. Currie gave the
final sermon in a series entitled,
“Learning to Live from:the Pat-
tern which Christ Taught Men.”
The subject upon which the min-
ister spoke was “Calvary,” and he
chose his text from the 23rd chap-
ter of Luke. “And when they came
to a place called Calvary,
they crucified Him.”

Rey. Currie began his sermon by
asking the congregation: “Why
do we sing of Calvary?” After all,
he explained, the hill upon which
Christ died was “a place of the
skull,” a slaughterpen, a place where
men were punished for their crimes
and suffered ‘the worldly penalty of
crucifixtion. Yet from Calvary, this
bare, lonely, tragic spot, there came
the world’s greatest and_ truest
wealth. Here Christ, the Son of
God, sacrificed himself that we
might be saved and our lives en-
riched. Christ became poor, hum-
bled himself before the vulgar mob,
that we through his poverty might
be rich.

Dr. Currie said that one of God's
most important laws is the law of
vicarious sacrifices, which states
“Nothing is rich, unless something
else is poor.” In nature, valleys are
fertile at the expense of bare, rocky
hillsides from which all soil has
been washed by storm and rain.
Men attain brilliant _ intellect
through sweat and blood. Our lib-
erties are the result of years of
toil and sacrificing the lives of
thousands of men. David Living-
ston is an example of a man who
sacrificed much ,for others, and
thereby enriched the lives of many
African-natives-in bringing to them
the word of God. He bore his
Calvary.

We today can name our own Cal-

there

‘vary, that thing for |which we will

sacrifice, and give our lives to. We
can enrich some thing, whether it
be our family, our business, or the
kingdom of God. If we choose the
right valley to enrich, thus will the

LOST!

A valuable pearl-handle knife
was left at the post office last
Monday afternoon. The knife
was rather unusual in that it was
a combination pair of scissors,
had two blades, a button hook,
nail file, cigar holder and an awl.
Its value lies in the fact that it
is a keepsake of the owner.

Mellen Gives Interesting
Information About Band

How His Band Was

Organized; Picks “You’re Laughing at Me”
As Best Song of the Current Season

Taking a few minutes off at the Saturday night dances, Earl

and mild marfnered tone about
and expressed his pleasure in
dances. Mellen was well re-
the set and his style of music
making appealed to all who
heard it. Mellen’s seeming
youth astonished many.
“The orchestra,” Mellen said, “is
officially known as Melodies by
Mellen and is formed as a corpor-
ation.” He went on to add that the
band was first formed by himself,
the first sax player, and the drum-
mer while they were attending a
high school in Pittsburgh in 1933.
In all ten members hail from Pitts-
burgh, the two trombone players
coming from West Virginia. Most
of the vocalizing is done by Mellen
himself, aided somewhat by Gor-
don Morrison, the piano player.
The theme song “Each Star
that Shines Above You.” The band
boasts seven arrangers of its own,

and they use strictly their own spe-
cial arrangements.

Queried as to his favorite dance
orchestras, Mellen replied that Hal
Kemp is his favorite band
while he admires Andre Kostlenatz

style

for his semi-classical swing and Ted
Fiorito for his fine arrangements.
He considers “You're Laughing at
Me” to be the hit of the current
season and picked “Star Dust” as
his all time favorite tune. Mellen
seemed to think that sweet music
was tops everywhere with a little
more trend toward swing music in
the north,
