No dirty laundry here

Grass stain on your new pair of pants? Commons’ joe made you sloppy?
Someone spill beer on you at PiKA? Have no fear, the most efficient, well-run service
on campus is at your disposal. That’s right, that slight slice of mothering we all need
from time to time called the Laundry will handle the job.

All of us who have used the Laundry—and what’s wrong with those of you who
don’t?—have experienced the magic which happens there. The button you didn’teven
know you’d lost is sewn back on. The rip repaired. The “Dry Clean Only” shirt
removed from the regular laundry and treated with that extra-special touch. All these
experiences make the Laundry so special.’

Does anyone know the kid who never used the Laundry until recently and is now
addicted to it? Drops clothes off there like it’s going out of style?

Listen to a tour of prospective students as they pass the Laundry. The tour guide
announces, “This is the College Laundry. As part of your tuition they do your laundry
for you.” The prospective students eyes bulge, the father turns to his son or daughter
and says in the way parents speak to their children in a mock-attempt at public
embarrassment, “This could be the school for you.” The admissions office will never
admit it, but the Laundry is why most people actually enroll here.

Does it really matter that many of us leave‘here after four years not knowing the
difference between “darks” and “lights” or what “Dry Clean Only” means? The real
world can teach us all about “fabric softeners,” “spin cycles” and “hot and cold” when
we graduate.

Right now let us salute and appreciate the Laundry, because of the miracles it
works, and because it keeps the real world at bay.

LETTERS
Stick to the Facts

To the Editors:
I am going to make this
short because as_ the

Davidsonian has become
more opinionated and one-
sided in its “news” reporting,
Tam sure that many readers
already take its stories with a
grain of salt. But the story on
IVCF in last week’s paper
simply must be addressed. It
is a perfect example of what a
news story should not be. It
begins with a blatant omis-
sion of facts. The article be-
gins by saying that IVCF was
denied a charter last year 16-
15 and then leaves out the
rather important fact that the
SGA overruled that decision
the next week 18-11.

The article then goes on
to give almost every argu-
ment against IVCF. But it
fails to present the rebuttals
that point out the flaws of
those arguments. Or the ar-
ticle takes the rebuttals so far
out of context that they make
no sense.

lam not going to get into
all the reasons [IVCF was re-
chartered. There are too
many. That may have been
why, out of 16 paragraphs in
the article, only two can be

said to give IVCF’s (or over
two-thirds of the SGA’s) side
of the debate. If the
Davidsonian staff was truly
interested in reporting the
news, they would have pre-
sented both sides of the de-
bate. It is clear that they are
not.

This trend toward yel-
low journalism and under-
handed attampts to influence
opinion is very. disappoint-
ing. If the editors and writers
of our paper have an opinion,
they should leave it out of the
news section. They can put it
in their editorial where they
will remain completely
anonymous (after all, theirs
is the only part of the Opin-
ions section where opinions
do not have to be claimed).
At least the editors have had
the decency to remove “The
South’s Foremost Weekly
Publication” from the top of
the Davidsonian’s front page.
I guess fact is still accurately
portrayed in some circum-
stances.

Eric Sapp ’98

Editor’s Note: While we
would not normally reply to
such a letter, Mr. Sapp’s

’ charge is so fundamental an

attack on the integrity and
professionalism of certain
members of the editorial
board that we must respond.
Though the article on IVCF
may have been imbalanced,
it was not intentionally so.
There was no attempt to bias
the article or condemn IVCF.
The editors — Randy
Hartwell, Teresa White, Mat-
thew Eirich (we write the edi-
torials, and leave them un-
signed, with the understand-
ing that they represent the
positions of the editorial
board, a customary pracitce
in most newspapers) — do
not agree with IVCF’s phi-
losophy. But we have never
distorted, biased, or slan-
dered that group in the News
section nor have we allowed
any writer to do so. To prove
his charge of “trend toward
yellow journalism” Mr. Sapp
may have wanted to find more
than one article fromthe News
section which he thought was
biased. Perhaps he could not
find others, or perhaps he
thought that a bald assertion
indicting our integrity would
carry his argument.
And the phrase is: “The
South’s Foremost College
Weekly.”

Article slighted Tyler’s performance

To the Editors:

I was more than a little
shocked when I read last
week’ s article about the base-
ball team’s winning streak.
Not about the team’s win-
ning streak, but rather how
Michael Kruse, the almighty
sports writer that he is, de-
scribed Marshall Tyler. Any-
one who went to the games
against Marshall (coinci-
dence), saw Tyler’s talented
display of skills in the field,
but especially at the plate. He
hita game-winning single and
a two run homerun the next
day.

I was appalled to read
that Kruse had the audacity
and lack of respect for Tyler
and all Varsity athletes to
write “the seldom-used out-
fielder played the role of the
unlikely hero both days.” Was
his performance shocking?
Unfortunately not everyone

- -is-as gifted as-Kruse; who

seems to excel at so much
that he deems it necessary to
try and belittle the non-start-
ers. I am sure that any other
sports writer with respect for
the time and effort varsity
athletes put into practice (so
that Kruse has something to
do on the weekends) would
have commended Tyler on
his outstanding performance.
But that was not all, he also
found it relevant to point out
that Tyler is not a starter, but
to say “seldom-used.” Are
you kidding? Did you think
about this before you wrote
it? He is better than you, me
and virtually everyone on this
campus. What is this unnec-
essary angst?. Why attemptto
do something so inane to take
away from his patience, tal-
ent and effort? Would it have
been to much to say, “Tyler
lifts Cats with outstanding
performance.”
‘Furthermore, later in the

article Kruse mentioned that - -

Tyler wasthe “backup goalie”
on the soccer team. Rel-
evance? Did you give that
phrase any thought? Or are
you just a smug unhappy
man? Tyler plays two Var-
sity sports, that is two more
than Michael Kruse. Do you
think about the amount of
time and effort that Tyler and
all athletes on this campus
spend in practice, refining
their skills.

They do all this, playing
a Division 1 sport at one of
the most academically rigor-
ous schools in the country,
along witheverything thatev-
eryone else here does too. Is
it really necessary to be ut-
terly senseless and apathetic?
I would only hope that you
would refocus your thoughts
towards the important issues
in your articles, rather than
the irrelevant and demeaning
status quo.
