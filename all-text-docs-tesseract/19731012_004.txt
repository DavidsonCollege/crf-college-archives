Keeping The Faith

Davidson College is finally
reexamining its historic policies and
beliefs about the Christian nature of
this institution. Hopefully out of the
evaluation will come changes in the
focus of this Christian Commitment to
keep it more in tune with the com-
munity living here.

In past issues this year. THE
DAVIDSONIAN has pointed out- the
need for everyone to work toward im-
proving the community spirit of the
college. We strongly feel that changes
in the Christian Commitment policies
are a good way to accomplish this.

Regardless of one’s religious per-
suasions - which could range from con-
firmed atheist to devout Christian -the
college's policies have a strong effect
on one’s lifestyle and thinking. Student
opinion is affected by the fact that he
must take at least two religion courses
before graduation. that the faculty on
the surface is devoutly Christian, and
that the governing trustees express a
strongly Christian bias.

The problem is that often these in-
dications of faith come across more
strongly in words than in actions. Take
for example the recent statement by
Dean of Students Will Terry (‘ himself
an ordained minister), ‘‘There is more
smallness. backbiting. mistrust. petty
gossip. malicious rumor. and literal

enmity (at Davidson) now that at any
time in my eleven years of recent
association here.”

That is just one statement which
reveals the depth of the problem. Un-
fortunately. the solution is more dif-
ficult to put into words.

For our part we would like to see a
continued expression of the Christian
faith here. Such things as the revived
Tuesday night service are a good way
to accomplish this.

However. we would also like to see
the college expand to meet the
challenges to Christianity more
openly. As Religion Professor Alexan-
der McKelway said, ‘The Christian
man is not called to a life pious
isolation, but is both freed and
challenged to participate in the world
of men and ideas openly and
fearlessly.”

Therefore, why not open up the
faculty to those who aren't Christians?
There would be little to lose, and much
to gain - for maybe they could
stimulate everyone to really think
what their faith means. And maybe in
the process, the problems Terry men-
tioned would disappear.

And why not make religion courses
voluntary so that students don’t feel
that they are being forced into a
religious faith or understanding.

Why ROTC ?

ROTC at Davidson was founded
over fifty years ago during a time of
declared war. Since that time. it has
remained on this campus and has
secured a place within the academic
curriculum. This merits recon-
sideration. Our reasons are twofold.

First. why exactly is academic
credit granted for work done in the
ROTC program during the junior and
senior years? Much of ROTC in-
struction is of an academic nature (eg.
leadership principles. thee conceptual
methods’ of leadership and
management. and military law). but
much more of it is vocational rather
than academic nature (eg.small unit
tactics and communications, ground
and air mobility, and advanced map
reading). Yet after the sophomore
year, academic credit is granted for all
of it.

Ostensibly, the purpose of ROTC is to
supply the United States armed forces
with trained officers. But does this lend
itself to a liberal arts program? No one
ever seems to ask this. ROTC has been
at Davidson for so long that its place in
the curriculum is accepted without
question.

Secondly, we wish to point out the
seeming inconsistency of military
preparation being included in the
program of a college that professes a
Christian commitment.

Found in the Statement of Purpose
section of the college catalogue is the
sentence, ‘‘As a college committed to
the historic Christian faith, it sees.
Jesus Christ as the central fact of
history, giving purpose, order and
value to the whole of life’’.

We wonder whether this purpose.
value and order are to be achieved and
perpetuated through training in the ar-
ts of warfare.

In light of these arguments, we feel
that ROTC should be removed from the
curriculum and be made available
solely on an extra-curricular basis.

Oil And Other Things

Recent events in the Middle East
have once again turned that barren
land into a battlefield, and driven the
world into a state of shock.

For the first time since the Cuban
Missle Crisis, many people are
genuinely afraid - afraid that the Cold
War may suddenly get hot as two of
the world’s superpowers who are now
materially and _ psychologically
backing their puppet ideological foils-
in an arena already smeared with hate
and blood from a conflict extending
through much of recorded time - may
take up the fight themselves.

Why must the Arabs and Jews fight
again? For Oil? (Israel is presently
pumping 120,000 gallons a day out of
the Sinai Peninsula.) Or for increased
power and prestige in the eyes of the
world? Or because winning the ‘‘Holy
War” has become so ingrained in the
minds of most Arabs and Jews that it
becomes essential to existence - and
that losing is like going through a
horrible withdrawal?

We would not even begin to answer
the question why or to say one side is
right and the other wrong. The issues
are just too complex.

All we can say is that we too feel fear
today.

Digestive Difficulty

As if there weren't enough
hang-ups on this campus, a new
phenomenon has been ob-
served At least. it's new to
freshmen and transfer stud-
ents To those of us who have
noticed it in previous years, it’s
still a shock

1 call it the “what for you
please’ neurosis. The name
even rhymes if you push it.

The effects of this
phenomenon are felt largely in
the area of the stomach.
However. prolonged suffering
can lead to depression and ob-
sessive behavior

Recent reports also note in-
creased thermal activity
around the heart .

The ‘what for you please
neurosis strikes in a small area
of the college community
Health officials have limited it
to three houses in Patterson
Court

Some who suffer from this
disease claim that it strikes
three times a day with clock-
like regularity. Others (who.
interestingly. sleep later in the
morning) report attacks only
twice daily

This insidious corrupter of in-
nocent peptic regions causes its
victims to suffer strange
cravings.

These obsessions seem to cen-
ter around food items replete in
Vitamin C and Vitamin D.
These, of course, are the most
scarce commodities in the
region.

The disease has the effect of
sending rampaging students
flying to the Tastee-Freeze in
Cornelius to drown their
sorrows in milkshakes.

Since the craving for Vitamin
D has been so beneficial to
Tastee-Freeze business, one ob-
server maintains that the ‘‘what
for you please” neurosis is aplot
hatched by dairy maids. This
rumor cannot be substantiated.

According to reports from
sufferers. the symptoms of the
disease follow a set pattern. The
sufferer feels drawn to one of
the three houses in Patterson
Court.

This attraction is ac-
companied by rumbling from
the stomach region and diz-
ziness. Once one steps into the

rapidly

It generally takes from fif-
teen minutes to half an hour for
the more aggravated symptoms
to subside. Symptoms may con-
tinue for three to four hours,
however.

One extreme case had to be
admitted to Morganton suf-
fering from a mental break-
down. This breakdown seems to
have occurred when a sufferer
was asked ‘‘what for you
please’ and offered uniden-
tified objects called ‘‘Muffa-
letto,’’ ‘‘Chicken la-la King”
and ‘‘Barcley.”’

Doctors refuse to give a
prognosis for the student's
recovery. Gifts of Tastee-
Freeze ice cream to the sufferer
are encouraged.

One of the side effects of the
disease is called the rip-off com-
pulsion. Maddened by the ef-
fects of the illness, some relief
has been noted by those who
give in to the rip-off com-
pulsion.

One sufferer reports that
Coke rip-off is most popular.
When asked why the rip-off
helped, he responded, ‘I just
have to get back at somebody.
man” and burst into tears.

Sufferers from *‘what for you
please’’ should take the
following steps.

1) Do not go near the three
suspect houses for at least 24
hours.

2) Take a vitamin pill a day.

3) If you must go to one of the
houses, stuff cotton in your
ears, and up your nose, and
wear dark glasses.

4) Go to the Hub for dinner.
(One rash sufferer rushed to
Swain’'s for relief, and suffered
the bends. )

5) Pray for an antidote.
