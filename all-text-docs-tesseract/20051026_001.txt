VOLUME 97, NUMBER 8

Panel held
to discuss
black sorority

By KATE GILLESPIE
News Editor

Student leaders attempting to
establish a historically black
sorority on campus led a panel
last night in the Sprinkle Room
to discuss the issues involved in
the initiative. PCC advisor Joy
Hamm, Assistant Dean of
Student Life Emest Jeffries, and
Assistant Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Khoury
Ashoosh also participated to
provide an administration per-
spective.

Panelists stressed the differ-
ences between: a historically
black sorority and white Greek
organizations. Historically black
sororities tend to focus more on
service than on social life.

“These organizations are dif-
ferent from a lot of the stereo-
types out there about sororities,”
panelist Ashley Moore ’07 said.

“They, aresopen and inclusive

organizations that sponsor intel-
lectual, spiritual, all sorts of
growth for women.”

The student leaders believe
that having a: historically black
sorority on campus will increase
the participation of minority
women on the Court.

“When I was a freshman and I
came in and visited the houses
on the Court, just because of the
small number of minorities on
the Court, I felt like my only
place was the BSC,” panelist
Anna Marie Glaize ’08 said.

Although the leaders of the
initiative want their own organi-
zation, they intend to cosponsor
service and social events with
eating houses. They have
already met with eating house
presidents and made presenta-
tions at house meetings to estab-
lish a cooperative relationship.

“They want to be involved in
eating houses,” Hamm said.
“They want to be an active part
of the Patterson Court communi-
ty. They’re not going to exist by
themselves. My hope is that [a
historically black sorority] is
going to integrate the Court.” —

Lilly Program seeks
new source of funding

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Staff Writer

As funding from its initial out-
side grant runs out, the Lilly
Programs for the Theological
Exploration of Vocation is in the
process of applying for permanent
endowment from the college.

The Lilly Programs started in
2000, when Davidson received a
four-year $1.9 million Lilly
Endowment from the Lilly
Foundation, an organization that
promotes the ideas that the pres-
ence of faith in the workplace leads
to a more fulfilling career and that
the integration of one’s values,
beliefs, and principles into one’s
daily life creates more meaningful
experiences.

The Lilly Programs are headed
by religion professor Tim Beach-
Verhey and Lorren Timberman,
who is in charge of sophomore pro-
gramming.

According to Beach-Verhey, the
Lilly Programs seek “to embody
and to promote the religious mis-
sion of the Reformed tradition,
which views each of us as recipi-
ents of gifts who are called to live
lives out of gratitude to God and to
provide service to others.”

The original grant will allow the
programs to continue until the end
of the spring 2006 semester.

Starting in the fall of 2006, the
Lilly Programs will then operate
for another three years on a
$500,000 sustainability grant from
the Lilly Foundation, which can
account for up to 50 percent of the

operating budget while the staff
seeks permanent endowment from
the college.

In the interim, the Lilly
Programs must focus on finding
donors to support their continuing
operation and, more immediately,
on matching whatever funding it
receives from the sustainability
grant. The original: Lilly
Endowment provided the Lilly
Program with a yearly budget of
$550,000. Under the sustainability
grant, the budget will shrink to
approximately $300,000 for each
of the next three years.

After that period, the goal is to
raise $6 million, which will be
placed into a fund overseen by the
college, from which five percent
interest, or $300,000, will be
drawn each year.

According to Beach-Verhey, the
staff chose the figure of $6 million
because it is an attainable goal that
will allow the Lilly Programs to
continue operating at a level near
its current capacity.

Although it is in no danger of
disappearing from campus, the
shift in funding will require the
Lilly Program to pare down its
budget and to truncate some of its
programming.

“Many programs that we think
are excellent and would love to see
continue we don’t have the finan-
cial wherewithal for anymore,”
Beach-Verhey said.

Modified versions of several
programs will continue despite

U.S. Secretary of Education Spellings spoke at Fall Convocation.

Spellings challenges
seniors to lead and serve

Faculty question
speaker choice

By JILLIAN BARTELS
Staff Writer

United States Secretary of
Education Margaret Spellings
addgessed students, faculty, and
parents at Fall Convocation in the
Duke Family Performance Hall last
Saturday.

Awards were presented to sever-
al faculty members and students at
Convocation, which marked the
first time the Davidson class of
2006 donned their caps and gowns.

Spellings became the eighth
Secretary of Education in January
of 2005, after serving as President
Bush’s Domestic Policy Advisor
during his first term. She is the first

mother of school-aged children to
become U.S. Secretary of
Education. Her oldest daughter is a
first-year student at Davidson.

Spellings began her speech by
applauding Davidson’s senior class
for making it through to
Convocation.

She told seniors that she knew
that each of them would do a lot in
the world using a “disciplined, cre-
ative mind for leadership and serv-
ice.”

Spellings charged seniors to
think about what they want to do
with their lives and to live by their
own “honor codes,” just as they
had been taught to do at Davidson.

Spellings then talked about her
dedication to education, including
her concerns about educating chil-

Jump i in housing prices concerns faculty

Many professors live in the college-owned McConnell neighborhood.

By LEx! HAMILTON
Senior Staff Writer

Housing prices in the immediate
Davidson College area have
increased by a dramatic 20 percent
from June 2004 to June 2005 com-
pared to the 0.25 percent average
North Mecklenburg increase dur-
ing the same period.

Some Davidson professors have
found that rising. housing prices
limit their ability to live close to
campus.

Associate professor of English
Ann Fox encountered this difficul-

ty when purchasing her home.

“T am a single woman purchas-
ing my home independently of any
outside or spousal assistance,” Fox
said. “So my purchasing power is
directly affected by increasing
housing costs. Much of the avail-
able Davidson housing market is
beyond my budget and personal
needs. But I was very fortunate that
I found a home that met my budget
and my personal criteria.”

From a faculty and staff perspec-
tive, there are numerous advan-
