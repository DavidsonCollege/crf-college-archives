“We're going to play wide open football. No mon ;
-of this control stuff.” These were the words of Coach
Bill Dole as he described the 1958 version of the Da

vidson Wildcats who open next Friday against Catav- |:

ba in Charlotte.

Coach Dole is patterning his offense after ae
pros down to the last degree. Each player has a note-
book full of plays, formations, X’s and O’s that re-
sembles something out of higher calculus.

Dole has the squad to play this brand of ball both
from the standpoint of brains as well as brawn.

Calling the signals of quarterback will be junior
Charlie Benson, one of the league’s leading passers
last year.

On the other end of his tosses at the ends will
be Jim Bloomfield and Harold Westervelt. At tackles
will be 225 pound John Watwood and 212 pound Scott
Lacy.

Alternate captain Charlie James will hold down
one guard, while 240 pound Paul Biggers will man the
other.

At center is converted fullback Dave Warden.
Dave seems capable of replacing all conference center
Bi}l Price, who graduated. ;

The halfback positions will feature Captain ‘Craig
Wall, who was one of the leading pass receivers in the

Coach Dole will say who'll start next Friday.

Other returnees who are looking good are Tom
Redding at quarterback, Harold Bynum at center, Dan
House at end, Johnny Crute at guard, and Alex Porter
at tackle.

Coach Dole seemed pleased with his new crop
of freshmen.

Freshmen Duncan Morton, John Pucker, and
Booker Clark look good at end while Bill Whitlington
and Sonny Fraley have shown up well at tackle.

Dole said Cecil Holcomb, Durant Vick and Buddy
Reeves have stood out at guard, and singled out Bruce
Usher for his play at center.

He said that freshman Brant McRorie, Lynwood
Mallard, and Jerry Sheffield have all played well at
halfback.

A real battle for top frosh fullback is shaping .
up between Graham Allison and Bob McAllister. Sam
Jackson appears to have gained the quarterback .posi-
tion on the freshman team.

The coach declined to comment on his team's
chances, but the sly grin on his face gave warning that
the Cats will be worth watching this year.
