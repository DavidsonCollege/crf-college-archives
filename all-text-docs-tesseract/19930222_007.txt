Sensationalism: The Real Problem in the Abortion Debate

By Bryan Allison

Since there was a presidential
election this past November, the
abortion issue was raised about as
often as Amy Fisher’s story ap-
peared on daily talk shows. I have
watched with much disgust as both
the pro-life and pro-choice fac-
tions took various snipes at one
another.

My purpose in this commen-
tary is not to taint you with my
personal viewpoint on the whole
mess. Instead, I want to comment
on the various despicable adver-
tisements that both sides have used
to steer the abortion issue away
from pure facts and to situations
that rarely or never occur.

Let’s start with the pro-life
commercials that herald the moni-
ker, “Life. What a Beautiful
Choice.” A perfectly healthy white
boy is seen in various adorable
poses ashis mother reminisces back

to whenshe got pregnant nine years
ago and was tempted to get an
abortion. But even though money
was tight, she decided to have the
baby. She closes by saying, “Now
Ijustcan’timagine life without my
little Billy!”

Give me a break. How ex-
treme is this case if it really exists?
The economy has been so strong
over the past nine years, I am sure
most lower-income Americans
have been promoted to executive
level jobs and are living the Ameri-
can Dream in Suburbia, U.S.A.,
breathing a huge sigh of relief that
they didn’t decide to get that abor-
tion after all.

Idon’tsee anything beautiful
about babies bom addicted to crack;
Idon’tsee anything beautiful about
a teenager who has to drop out of
school and will be lucky to ever go
back to high school much less go
on to college. A kid born with

physical deformities or into a pov-
erty stricken family may have ev-
ery right to be bom, but stick to the
facts.

Let’s see. What is a better
way the pro-life group who paid
the thousands of dollars for this
advertisement could have spent
their money? More counselling on
the other viable options to abor-
tion? More education on the nu-
merous methods of birth control?

Ican only imagine that sucha
commercial would only cause more
resentment than actual good. I
seriously doubt some unmarried,
uneducated pregnant girl about to
have an abortion is going to see
this ad during an old “MacGyver”
rerun and decide that she ought to
reconsider.

But the pro-lifers are not the
only guilty party. Planned Parent-
hood sent out some propaganda
posters before the presidential elec-

tion that rival the stupidity of the
pro-life commercials. One poster
proclaims, “Vote now or forever
hold your sperm.”

It goes on to relate that if Bill
Clinton is elected president, ev-
eryone will be able to have sex
whenever they please. But if
George Bush is re-elected, there
really isonly onechoice: to abstain
completely from sex. Another
poster warns, “Don’t vote for
George Bush if you ever want to
have sex again.”

Viewing this from a strictly
logical perspective, the posters fail
to mention one vital factor that I
daresay the majority of Americans
are familiar with.

Or maybe I’m being naive in
thinking that mosteducated people
have heard of the amazing techno-
logical breakthrough of the
condom, Clearly, the clowns at
Planned Parenthood must view all

males as some sort of Cro-
Magnons stuck in the Dark Ages,
wanting to spread their seed wher-
ever and whenever they please
without discretion in order to en-
sure the survival of their tribe.

Of course, one cannot get out
ofa debate witha pro-choice backer
without them mentioning thecases
of rape, incest, or threat to the
mother. Again, examples of ex-
treme cases taking precedent over
more typical ones.

My point in noting the incon-
sistencies of these advertisements
is that the money could be better
spent. It is an entirely different
situation when athe owner of prod-
ucts like soft drinks or deodorant
take pot shots at their competitors.
Doesn’t the decision to abort’ a
pregnancy or not deserve more vi-
tal information and less sensation-
alism?

Deep Thoughts...

People Need to Take Responsibility

Our professors are constantly
reminding us to revise our writing
before turning it in for evaluation.
They tell us to be certain we have
read enough background material
to know enough about our subject
to make a point. Likewise, in the
classroom, the less-adventuresome
among us will keep our mouths
shut if we have not sufficiently
completed reading for class dis-
cussion. Similarly, we are asked to
read all of the given directions
before beginning an assigned aca-
demic task. The message underly-
ing all of these examples is that
good students think before they
act. Isn’t it amazing that a skill so
vital to academic success is so
rarely used outside the classroom?

Recently, I witnessed a physi-
cal altercation between two people
which aptly illustrates our collec-
tive refusal to examine the conse-
quences of ouractions before com-
mitting to them. A friend of mine,
in a spontaneous effort at humor,
pulled what he viewed as a harm-
less prank on someone else. Little
did he think that his victim might
not see any humor in the joke. In
the same way, the duped person’s
immediate violent reaction, with-
Out any attempt to respond ratio-
nally or civilly, displayed an
equivalent lack of thought.

Of course, there is a place for
spontaneous, instinctive behavior.

This week I heard a Super Bowl
referee on the radio explaining how
he makes calls during a game.
Because things happen so fast in
athletic contests, he is sometimes

Kirby Shealy

forced to rely on his instincts when
calling a penalty, much like the
athletes themselves who mustmake
quick decisions at times without
really thinking about them.

In a game situation, however,
both the referees and athletes know
and accept the risks they take when
they act instinctively. Athletes
know that they may miss a catch,
flub a pass, or turn the wrong way
and end up under a pile of bodies.

crease exponentially if we could
only devise (or reinstate) a system
that is easy, convenient, and ef-
fortless enough for the laziest of
us. (You didn’t even have to sepa-
rate anything in the old days; for
fun I used to stuff newspapers in-
side cans and bottles and put them
in cardboard boxes.)

If only all the forest green
people could band together and
harness the lime green people’s
untapped recyclables, we could live
in a veritable tree hugger Utopia.
Also, I think that the lazy people of

this school use far more beer cans
than the forest green people. That’s
just a guess, but I’d put money on
it.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but
isn’t Davidson supposed to be cre-
ating leaders of the world? Ifso, it

would only make sense that this

institution do everything in its
power to make sure that there is a
world left to lead. The removal of
the recycling bins (and from all
convenient recycling, as far as I
can tell) is a huge black mark on
Davidson itself.

Referees accept that they will
sometimes make mistakes, and
even if they call a game perfectly,
not everyone will be satisfied with
the officiating. They are willing to
put themselves in this precarious
position because, at the end of a
contest, there is a winner and a
loser. But, for the most part, no
real harm is done.

Outside of sucha setting, how-
ever, we must all try to act ratio-
nally to avoid hurting others or
ourselves. Ispeaknotjustofphysi-
cal disputes, but of verbal argu-
ments, and even friendly jibes be-
tween friends. So often, the humor
of an impulsive moment évapo-
rates after some reflection and even
appears malicious if the joke is at
the expense of another individual
orgroup. These attempts at wit are
the genesis of perhaps the majority
of the intolerant acts on this and
other campuses.

Spontaneous, emotionally-in-

spired actions are notalways harm-
ful to others or even truly harmful
to ourselves, but they can certainly
make us look foolish at times. An
illustration that leaps to mind is the
columns and letters of my fellow
students and I that appear in this
newspaper which are so often vacu
ous tracts of rubbish.
I personally know the thrill of hav-
ingone’snameconsistently printed
ina publication, but I also know all
too well the embarrassment of read-
ing a piece that I have submitted
only to discover that it did not
receive enough thought or time to
call it my best effort. We would all
do the college community and our-
selves a favor by refraining from
preSenting writing inspired by
poorly-researched anger, idle bore-
dom, or bare commitment to being
acolumnist. The result would be a
better paper and less wasted time
for all of us.

If we choose to exert restraint
over our emotions in our actions,
words, and writing, we will at last
be living the most important les-
son we will ever learn here.

this out. Filar himself later admits
that [afternoon’s] “a lousy time to
play a game... I didn’t want to be
the lead-in to a UNC-Charlotte
men’s game.” AD Holland’s fig
leaf, that “as compensation . . .
women’s basketball would keep
the $4,500 Davidson collected for
renting ... to UNCC.” Again, his
statements are contradicted by Fi-
lar, who states that “the way it was
explained, it would go into the
athIctic budget, which may or may
notcome back to women’s baskct-
ball.” It appears that somconc’s
been less than truthful.

Now about the faculty. Pro-
fessors David Martin and Mary
Anne Moore conclude that AD
Holland’s actions constitute bla-
tant sexism which “humiliated the
women’s team.” Their two-page
resolution, to be presented at the
next faculty mecting will request
“a public apology to Davidson and
Radford teams and the $4,500 to
be spent ‘as a miscrable bit of
compensation’ on academics.”
Radford coach Luby Lichonczak,
less sanguine than AD Holland,
would seem to agree. In her opin-
ion, “it's a bitter disappointment

for me to see that other women’s
programs aren’t given priority over
outside teams.”

“Cause we know they need it,
we're going to give everybody the
advice they sorichly deserve. First,
to Athletic Director Terry Holland:
Get aclue. It scems pretty ques-
tionable that you would rent out
our arena and bump the basketball
team to an uncnviable time slot.
For the sake of diplomacy, make
the apology.

To Professors Martin and
Moore: .thanks for bringing up an
issuc the administration wouldn’t
have mentioned on their own. If
you haven’t heard from the Dean
of Faculty, you surely will.

To the Faculty: Grow a back-
bone for a change. Think back to
those heady grad school days when
you cared more about ideas than
about the performance of your
mutual funds. Support thisresolu-
tion.

Finally, to the trustees (arbi-
ters of truth and justice): we think
we know where you can gct the
moncy to replace this money-grub-
bing policy. Try looking under the
rock labeled “Athletic Director."

nied benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any educa-
tion program or activity receiving
federal financial assistance.” I
think that one of the “benefits” of
playing collegiate athletics at a
small school like Davidson is the
familiar support of the commu-
nity. Coach Filar says that one of
the things that he enjoys telling
recruits is that they will probably
know their fans. How many fresh-
men at UVA can say that they have
had aclass with a soccer player, or

‘even recognize them off the field?

This “benefit” of Davidson athlet-
ics can only be truly achieved if
Davidson students give women’s
athletics achance. Davidson has a
good women’s basketball team.
They have won many more games
than they were expected to win. It

is very possible that they will have
a.500 record playing against Divi-
sion I teams. They have players
who hustle and never give up. The
problem is that no one knows. The
so-called great Davidson fans
should have been there when
Davidson women’s basketball beat
Barton and Charleston Southern.
They should have seen senior Jen-
nifer Roos ignore Coach Filar and
shoot the 3-point shot with six sec-
onds to go against Winthrop. Ev-
ery person who likes basketball
should be there on Saturday, Feb-
tuary 29th at 7:30 to watch Jenni-
fer Roos and Jennifer Plowright
play their last basketball game ever
for Davidson against Division I
UNC Asheville: I wouldn’t miss it
for the world.
