As I See It

Lately I have been very de-
pressed about some of the articles
in the opinions section. Much has
been written about race relations,
and I’m sad to see how bad things
have gotten at Davidson. Enough
has been said on this subject, so I
decided to write about something
else. I’m going to talk about friend-
ship.

Pete is the first friend I can
vividly remem-
ber. We lived on

iron and brick at its base. We were
terrified of this fence. A sixth-
grader once told us that a boy had
got his head stuck in between the
iron bars. He said that the police
could not remove the boy’s head,
so they left him there until he died
and rotted away. Pete and always
rode on the same sled. We flew
down, and as we saw the fence, we
screamed in fear. We tried to wait

until the last mo-

ment before we

Yale University
in New Haven,

jumped off. The
plastic sled
crashed against

Connecticut.
Pete was skilled
in the art of Legos, and I was not.
But that minor detail did not hurt
ourrelationship, because I was ath-
letic, and he was not. Pete showed
me how to build cars and planes; I
showed him how to throw a foot-
ball and kick a soccer ball without
hurting his toe.

There was one thing, how-
ever, that we both did well. We
both could sled. Pete and I always
took our sleds to the Dean’s house
when it snowed because there was
a huge hillin hisback yard. In fact,

to second-graders like us, it was a
- mountain. The only problem with
our paradise was the fence made of

the fence, we
laughed, and
waited to go up again.

When I moved to Mississippi,
Imadeanew friend named Bobby.
Bobby and I appeared to be identi-
cal because we both loved sports.
We playedevery sport imaginable.
We shot baskets, hit tennis balls,
and threw the football together.
Bobby played three varsity sports
at our high school, and I played
two.

Bobby and I disagreed on on
only one thing: our favorite col-
lege teams, which just happened to
be arch-rivals. I loved Ole Miss,
andhe loved Mississippi State. We
went to all of the football and base-

ball games in which they played
each other. He wore maroon and
white for Mississippi State. I wore
red and blue to show my support
for Ole Miss. We sat together, and
he yelled for the Bulldogs, while I
screamed for the Rebels.

Now I am going to school at
Davidson College. My best
friend’s name is Charlie. Charlie
and I have many things in com-
mon, but basketball is what brought

us together. We went and played
basketball every day my freshman
year, and those games helped build
a friendship that continues today.

I have to admit something to
you. Ihavebeen lying to you. The
guy from Connecticut is not named
Pete. His name is Sang Huyp, and
he is Korean. And the guy from
Mississippi, he is not a guy at all.

Gull's Nest

If Bill was

By Bill Gullan

Many of my fellow colum-
nists have been recently giving te-
dious advice to freshpeople con-
cerning all facets of Davidson life.
Some of it is useless, some rela-
tively worthwhile, and, alas, some
iscompletely incorrect. However,
I’ve put my cigarettes out and am
ready to advise the entire commu-
nity on what to do when Backstreet
is carding too hard: see a movie!

Movies are fun, relatively in-
expensive, and your neighbors and
friends might have some in their
rooms. I have a bunch if anyone is
bored one night. Here are my
favorite films, all of which one
should definitely see.
1-"Free (slick) Willie": This is the
story of a crooked and pathetic US
President held hostage by special
interests and his wife.
2- "Say Anything": A documen-

a. top Hollywood movie mogul

tary about the production of Raf
and Travis’s column.

3- "Much Ado About Nothing":
This is a somewhat boring film
about the endless discussions that
ensue at an SGA meeting.

4- "The Money Pit": This is a
documentary about the making of
our new Arts Center.

5- "Frat Boys in Paradise": Cham-
pagne Party ... ‘nuff said.

6- "Saturday Night Fever": Aregu-

lar guy develops a mysterious af-

fliction when he is asked by a cos-

metically challenged girl to a date

function.

7- "Fried Green Tomatoes": A

horror movie about lunchtime at

the Commons.

8- "Strange Brew": A confusing

film about attempts by the Admin-

istration to implement a clear and

unambiguous alcohol policy.

9- "Strange Brew II": An action-

packed sequel in which thealcohol
policy is dramatically overhauled
and students are permitted to bring
two beers up instead of one. Com-
ing soon, hopefully, Strange Brew
III. :

10- "Major League III": A predict-
able story about a team and their
legions of bandwagon fans react-
ing to athird straight World Series
loss.

11- "The Lawnmower Man": A
horror film about an irresponsible
Physical Plant worker who goes
crazy and leaves grass clippings
all over the court.

12- "Dr. Who?": A foreign film,
starring Kuzmanovich, Toumazou,
Serebrennikov, and other faculty
members.

13- "Planes, Trains, and Automo-
biles": A film about three Davidson
students rushing home for Christ-
mas this year. Only the first one

makes it in time.

14- "The Incredible Journey": An
epic that follows an undaunted
sophomore on his trek from down
the hill to class.

15- "Three Men and a Baby": A
film starring Chris Frampton and
three other actors.

16- "Summer School": A charm-
ing story of three frat boys who
finish pledging and start planning
their summer vacations.

17- "Risky Business": A propa-
ganda piece advocating enormous

‘ expenditures on extra lighting and

emergency phones for people walk-
ing around campusafter dark. NOT
based on a true story.
18- "The Distinguished Gentle-
man"; A tribute to Dean Terry.
So folks, come join us and the
guys across the hall. We’ll throw
in a flick, pop some corn, and suck
down a few Co-Colas.

is not Charlie. His real name is
DeVane, and he is black.

Ihave been lying to you fora
reason. I hope you thought that all
the friends Ihave been talking about
are just like me. I hope you visual-
ized them as white males. I have
been lying to you to prove my
point. Prerequisites for friendship
should not exist. Friendship knows
no nationality, no gender, and no
race.

Sang Huyp spoke very little
English, but our common interests
gave us a bond that neither the
English nor the Korean language
couldeverexpress. Westill played
the same games as other kids, but
we let our actions, not our words,
create the fun we had.

Yes, Courtney was a girl, but
she crushed all the stereotypes
about women. She did play three
varsity sports. She did shoot bas-
kets, hit tennis balls, and throw the
football with me. Our friendship
did not know that Courtney was a
girl.

Last, I see something in
DeVane that goes much deeper
than his skin. I can go to him with
my problems, and he can come to
me with his.

The good times will be just as
good, and the bad times will be just
as bad as if he happened to be
white. Common interests, notcom-
mon features, make friendships.
Thatis my definition of friendship,
and that is what friendship should
always be.

The filthy,

By Nathan Seay

This summer, I got an oppor-
tunity to do something that very
few people have done in recent
years. I saw "Star Wars" On a big
screen. I got there at eight o’clock
on a Saturday morning (two hours
- before the movie started), and I
was probably the four hundredth
person in line. I’m not kidding.
(Granted, the guys who stood in
line behind me talked constantly
about how cool it was to camp
outside the theater the night before
"Batman" opened. I was in my
element.)

But my point is this: I’m get-
ting old. “How in the heck did you
arrive at that conclusion?” you

dirty-rotten liars never-ever saw "Star Wars"

ask. Well, let me explain. Most of
the people there were my age or
older. The few that were younger
than I were dragged there by their
parents. Let me unload this fact
upon all of you: This year’s fresh-
men class was one year old the day
that "Star Wars" was released.
Yes, that’s right. If you go up toa
freshman and ask this person (PC
journalism) if they remember see-
ing the movie of movies, they will
answer “no.” Well, they should
say “no.” If they don’t, kick them
in the kneecaps. They’re a filthy,
rotten liar and they deserve to be
put in a great deal of pain.
Another thought came
quickly: those same freshpeople

were four years old when "Em-
pire" came out. I was older when
I saw the first one than when they
saw the sequel. I think that’s why
I can’t always relate to people
younger than I am. Waiting for
each movie in the trilogy helped
define wholIam. You cannotimag-
ine how painful it is for a kid to
wait for three long years to find out
what happens to Han Solo or if
Darth Vader really is Luke’s fa-
ther. Thiscliffhanger was dumped
on my lap when I was eight. Three
years is over one third of your life
at eight years. I feel haughty when
I’maround these people who have
only experienced "Star Wars" on
video cassette. They only have to

take. the time to change cassettes to
find out all the answers. It is im-
possible for anyone to gain the
patience and fortitude I (and the
rest of the twenty-one year olds of
the world) gained from age five
through eleven.

Am that old? Is there anyone
else out there who doesn’t think
that “Mr. Roboto” is a bad Japa-
nese movie? Is A Flock of Seagulls
within the span of anyone else’s
memory? How can I explain to
anyone just how exciting it was to
see "Spacehunter: Adventures in
the Forbidden Zone?" (It was a 3-
D movie, you see.) I’m not sure if
anyone ever rollerskatesany more,
but I know that it sure was hip in

the early 80’s (anyone remember
OliviaNewton-Johnin "Xanadu?")
Ihave a feeling that if I went today,
they probably wouldn’t play “The
Stroke” or “Superfreak.” I wish
that I could just step back intime to
the age of roller skating at Hot
Wheels, when girls were gross and
the music was funky. Well, maybe
not funky; how about synthetic?

I would give anything to re-

turn tothat age of innocence, when

the most pressing thing on my mind
was how many more summers it
was until the next episode in the
adventures of Luke Skywalker. If
I could only spend the next three
years guessing what will happenin
the next part of the series.
