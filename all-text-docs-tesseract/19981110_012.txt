On Wednesday, November 4, the
Wildcats Volleyball team met the Ti-
gers of the “Davidson of the
North.” The Princeton Ti-
gers came to Belk Arena with

a 15-10 record overall, while

Wildcats were looking fora §
win to restore their confi-
dence, as losses in the previ-
ous weekend had been minor
setbacks in their successful
season. No love is lost on
either side of a Princeton-
Davidson matchup, so the
match promised to be an ex-
citing one.

The match lived up to
its expectations. The first
game opened with both the
Wildcats and the Tigers play-
ing well. The game ended in
a close 15-12 win for the
‘Cats. The Tigers responded with force
in the second game behind some solid
play. They were able to combine strong
defense with effective offense to take
the game 15-5.

The punishing second game took
its toll on the ‘Cats. Princeton was able
to dominate throughout, winning the

third game 15-1. The Wildcats now
stood on the verge of a loss, down 2
games to 1, having just lost by a consid-
erable margin.

gers’ play. Davidson won the fourth
game 15 to9. With the teams knotted
at 2 games a piece, the match turned to
the fifth and decisive game. The fifth
was the rally game, with the scoring not
based upon control of the serve. The
rally game was close, but the Tigers
eventually emerged victorious 15-13.

The women’s soccer season came
to an end last Tuesday night when the
Wildcats fell 1 to 0 to Wofford College
in the first round of the Southern Con-
ference Tournament.

The game was highly competitive
as the two teams battled to a scoreless
first half during which time the ‘Cats
kept the Wofford goal keeper busy forc-
ing her to make five saves. Unfortu-

nately, how-

goal.Head Coach Kevin Hundley said

the game was especially tough due to .

the large number of Davidson players
out with injuries. Players sidelined with
injuries included senior Rhina Roberts,
Junior Kelly Rennick who injured her
ankle the Saturday before the game, and
Junior Kate McKnight who was lost in
the second half due also due to an ankle
injury. “Of our top fourteen or fifteen

players, only 4 played in the game,”
Hundley said. “It kept us from attaining
our full potential.”

Injuries also plagued the ‘Cats
throughout the regular season. Hundley
pointed out that three players suffered
season ending knee injuries, while
Freshmen Carolyn Stumpf and Natalie
Cox, while having solid seasons, also
suffered from series of injuries such as
calf pulls and ankle sprains. Hundley
called the injuries unfortunate and said
he wished he could have had the whole
team throughout the season.

Despite the injury-plagued season,
several individuals had outstanding sea-
sons. Junior Kelly Rennick was named
tothe first-team all conference. Rennick
was third on-the team with shots on
goal, 23. Hundley said Rennick was
especially valuable due to her ability to
adapt to a new. position. Rennick, who
is normally a mid-fielder, made the
switch to defense this season. “She was
significant and instrumental in solidify-
ing the defense,” Hundley said. ‘‘She
prevented a lot of teams from scoring
and was key toa lot of our success this
year.”

Princeton came to Davidson with
a strong team, and the match was a true
contest. Unfortunately the Wildcats
didn’t get the crucial burst of confi-
dence that comes with a win. They did,
however, play
very well as a
team. Eleven
players saw action
in the match. The
individual high-
lights were im-
pressive. On de-
fense, Brooke
Bentley led the
team with a pro-
verbial __ton’s
worth of digs. She
had 26 digs while
Mara Mordini,
Ginny Quis, and
Jennifer Ortega all
had 10 digs or
more. Janet
Duncan led the
team with 8 total
blocks. Offen-
sively, Mordini
led the team with
12 kills while
Gina Lawrence
had 10 kills. Quis led the team in kill
percentage with a 36% efficiency rat-
ing. The ‘Cats hoped.to build on these
individual performances as they looked
toward the weekend’s matches.

The loss moved the Wildcats to
18-9 on the season, but did not affect
their Southern Conference standing.

all-conf team

to the second-team all conference.
Hundley called Dye one of the team’s
best offensive players and someone they
depended ona great deal throughout the
season, especially because Dye was one
of the few players to remain injury-free
for the entire season. Dye led the team
in 4 major categories; she had 35 shots
on goal, seven goals, three assists, and
17 points. ;

With the loss to Wofford, the ‘Cats
finished the season at 7 and 13 overall
and 5 and 3 in the Southern Conference.
Their record earned them third place in
the final conference standings behind
second-place Furman and first-place
UNC Greensboro. UNCG finished on
top of the conference in both the regular

" season and in the tournament by virtue
of their 2-0 defeat of Furman in the
tournament final. UNCG will represent
the Southern Conference against
Vanderbilt in the upcoming NCAA tour-
nament.

Looking ahead, the ‘Cats will take
some much-needed time off to recover
from injuries before beginning to train
again in the spring. “We’re gonna look
to get ourselves prepared for next year,”
Hundley said.

explosive team. For senior leaders Janet
Duncan and Sarah Covell, this match
was their final regular season home
game in a Wildcat uniform. More than
anything, Saturday was a time to re-
member two athletes who have contrib-
uted a great deal to the volleyball pro-
gram and the campus community.

The Wildcats entered the match
coming off a recent breath of confi-
dence from their win against the Col-
lege of Charleston on Friday, a confer-
ence battle they won 3-0. Junior Gina
Lawrence led Davidson with 7 kills and
a .429 attack percentage in the route.
Brooke Bentley led all players with 9
digs. The win was important in restor-
ing the Wildcats after several tough
matches.
The following day, Georgia Southern
came to Belk Arena with a solid 16-13
record. The Wildcats scored early and
often. The Eagles fell quickly under the
onslaught, losing the first game 15-2.
Georgia Southern. bounced back in the
second game, outscoring the ‘Cats 15-

Both teams were playing well as

Combining steady
leadership with a defensive strength
and offensive effectiveness, Janet led
her team to the win. She had 9 kills, 7
digs and 7 blocks. Her 7 blocks led the
team. As a middle blocker who made
the Second Team All-Conference last
year, Janet Duncan has been a steady
force in Davidson volleyball.

Her senior compatriot this season
has been the defensive specialist Sarah
Covell. Sarah has been a true leader for
the entire ‘season. From her constant
enthusiasm to her example of unbroken
hustle, Sarah has never let up in her
commitment to the team. In her final
regular season match, she playeda solid
game, fulfilling her role as a defensive
specialist.

Sarah and Janet left an indelable
mark on Davidson volleyball. As the
team looks forward to the postseason,
these two seniors will be called upon
one final time. The ‘Cats will wrap up
the regular season with matches at
Furman and Wofford before heading to
App. St. for the Southern Conference
Tournament.
