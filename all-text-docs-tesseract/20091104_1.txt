The entrance to the library has
recently undergone a temporary
change: A wall has been erected
several feet from the front doors of
the building.

Construction of this wall and a
graffiti contest, which took place
Friday, marked the start of the event
series “Freedom Without Walls,”
hosted by the Department of Ger-
man and Russian to commemorate
the 20th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall.

“The fall of the Berlin Wall 20
years ago, on November 9, 1989,
marked the beginning of a new era
in history,” said Dr. Burkhard Hen-
ke, Professor of German and Chair
of the German Department. “It was
the end of the Cold War, the begin-
ning of a fully united Europe and
proof that peaceful change is pos-
sible, even in the moments when it
seems most unlikely.

“The building of the wall rep-
resented a desperate attempt by the
East German government to put a
stop to the tremendous brain drain
that plagued the new country,”
Henke continued.

“Almost ten percent of the
population had fied the regime,
many of them highly qualified in-
dividuals. On August 13, 1961, the
government blocked all access to
the western part of the city, itself
an island in East German territory.
In the next 28 years, several hun-
dred people were killed by border
guards as they tried to escape.”

Other events in the series in-
clude an ongoing exhibit and slide-
show in the Library until Nov. 16, a
screening of the film “The Lives of
Others” in Semans Lecture Hall in

the VAC on Nov. 5, and a celebra-
tion on Nov. 9, entitled “Tear down
this wall!”

At this event, the wall outside
the library will be struck down.
“We’ll have sledgehammers and a
chainsaw to bring it down,” Henke
said. “There’ll be bratwurst and
sauerkraut and hot cider.”

A week later, on Nov. 16, Dr.
Lutz Goergens, Consul General of
the Federal Republic of Germany,
will speak at the Carolina Inn. “He
will talk about the Wall and the di-

visions it signified,” Henke said.

Consul General in Atlanta since

the German Federal government as
head of the EU Internal Market Af-
fairs section, and held diplomatic
posts in Ankara, Mexico City, Tu-
nis and Algiers,” Henke said.

“He was German Foreign Ser-
vice desk officer for the Maghreb
and Arabian Peninsula states and
was political counselor to the Or-
ganization of American States for
the German embassy in Washing-
ton. He was trained in German lit-
erary history as a medievalist (PhD

Several seniors helped organize
the event series, including German
Major Moriah Wood °10, who is
responsible for the exhibit in the li-
brary. “The Graffiti contest featured
mostly German 101 students, some
seniors and international students,”
Henke said, also encouraging all
Davidson students, regardless of
major, to attend the events. “The
screening of ‘The Lives of Others’
is for students, and we won’t be able
to tear down the thing without their
help. Students are also the primary
audience for Goergens’ visit.”

‘Master Plan’ to act as framework for campus development

CRISTINA BUSTILLO
Staff Writer

Over the course of the past
few days Davidson students have
been hearing a great deal about
the Davidson Strategic Plan. Cam-
pus planning is a process, and one
of the culminating events in this
process is the creation of a Master
Plan. This plan is a framework for
future campus development.

Davidson has been working
with Shepley Bulfinch, a consulting
and architectural planning firm that
identified the changes the physical
campus needs in order to support
the Davidson’s Strategic Plan.

In order to do this, a Master
Plan was created to show all of the
changes that the physical campus
will need in order to support the
Strategic Plan.

“The Strategic Plan calls for

hiring new faculty to increase in-
terdisciplinary programs,” She-
pley Bulfinch team leader Annie
Newman said. “Hiring new faculty
means that the College will need
to have offices and research space
available for them. There is also a
need for enough classrooms to ac-
commodate the new courses they
will be teaching. Not all aspects of
the Strategic Plan will have direct
impacts on the physical campus,
but many will.”

In addition to planning new
buildings and workspaces, the
Campus Master Plan also offers an
opportunity for the current organi-
zation of campus to be revised and
improved.

The time line of the Mas-
ter Plan is 20 years, which gives
enough time to revise, improve and
add to the current campus, but it
also allows for enough flexibility

to accommodate any challenges or
opportunities that can’t be foreseen
but that will inevitably occur.

In order for the Campus Master
Plan to be as good as it can be, it
needs to have input and feedback
from all of the constituents of Da-
vidson College, which include stu-
dents, faculty, staff, alumni, etc.
Since every one of these groups
has a different experience regard-
ing Davidson, any problem areas
will be identified.

This coming Monday, the She-
pley Bulfinch team that has been
working on the Davidson Master
Plan will be coming to the College
to present the options that they have
developed to address all the issues
and needs that the campus has.

They will be presenting the op-
tions in Commons, from 12:15 p.m.
to 1:15 p.m., and in the Union from
1:45 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. They will

then be moving to the Lilly Gal-
lery to present the plan to faculty
and staff. This allows all students,
faculty and staff to attend and iden-
tify what they like and what they
don’t from the options that are pro-
vided. In addition to this, students
and staff will also be able to pres-
ent new ideas to the team for their
consideration.

The team said that they hope
to get as much feedback as possible
because it is their goal to improve
the physical campus without chang-
ing what Davidson feels like.

“While aspects ofthe masterplan
will not be complete, or even start,
before many of you graduate, we
want to be sure that when you come
back for homecoming and other
alumni events that you feel that Da-
vidson is still Davidson (albeit im-
proved),” Newman said. “We need
your input to ensure that future.”
