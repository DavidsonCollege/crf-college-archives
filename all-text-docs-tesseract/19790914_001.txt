College faces

labor charges

By JOLIN BOSWELL
Staff Correspondent

The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) has filed a
formal complaint against the
College stating that its officials
tried to ‘‘discourage concerted
activity among its employees.”

The complaint also alleges
that the College discriminated
against three employees of the
Physical Plant in regard to the
terms of their employment. The
case will be heard before a
Labor Board administrative law
judge February 4, 1980 in
Charlotte. :

The filing of the complaint on
August 7 is a major step in
what has been a long procedure
dealing with the grievances of
the three employees—Bill Rol-
land, Ruben McIntosh, and
David Alexander.

The employees complained
that after they circulated a
January petition protesting
College time clock and paycheck
procedures, the College took
unfair disciplinary actions a-
gainst them. The employees
were put on probation and

Expected fundingproblems doom NC Fellowsprogram

This academic year will be the
last for Davidson's North Caro-
lina Fellows chapter, barring a
“miracle,” said Associate Dir-
ector Mrs. D. Grier Martin.

In fact, College officials are
already working on a replace-
ment program.

and outside organizations.

According to Dr. Kello, Dir-
ector of the program, the conti-
nuation of thefellows program
has been in question for several
years. The sponsor of the
program, the Richardson Foun-
dation, has been granting funds
on an annual basis for the past
two years. Kello said that in
recent years the foundation has
not been able to procure enough
money from businesses and
other sources to run the pro-
gram.

As a result, Martin said,
there is only enough money to
get the program
through this year.

she and Kello both feel a strong

Koller and Retzer protest

Spencer denies reevaluation

of tenure decision of last May

By JOHN SIMAN
Asst. News Editor
Sociology Professor Norman Koller and Political Science
Professor Joseph Retzer have denounced both the tenure decisions
of last May and the manner in which the decisions were reached.
The two professors and English Professor Georgianna Ziegler
were the first professors to be refused tenure under the new Code of
Faculty Evaluation Procedures. The faculty adopted the Code in

March.

Retzer stated that by evalua-
ting him under the new Code,
the Administration ‘changed
the rules in the middle of
the game.’ The professors
denied tenure arrived at David-
son in 1973. The faculty adop-
ted the Code two months before
the Administration announced
the tenure decisions.

“There's nothing one can do
in the eleventh hour (about new
criteria),"" Koller said. However
College President Samuel Spen-
cer maintained, ‘‘The Code is
not a set of new criteria. It is a
codification of past criteria.”
(There was no actual written
evaluation procedure until the
passage of the present code.)

Spencer also said that since
1973 getting tenure has become
‘‘more difficult all over the
country, including Davidson.”’

Spencer concurred with Trus-
tee Dickson Phillips: statement
that “...it is likely that small
first-rate colleges face no graver
risk to their long term excel-
lence than. becoming ‘over-
tenured’ with faculty members
who (though good and maybe
better than good) are not as
vood as the best that the college
can rightly aspire to attract and

Billing change
hurts NC-PIRG

By ELIZABETH KISS
Staff Correspondent

The Davidson chapter of
NC-PIRG has lost 95 percent of
its funding as a result of a
recent change in college billing
procedures.

President Samuel Spencer's
decision to omit the $4 fee
supporting PIRG from student -
bills caused PIRG's funding to
drop to $200, down $3800 fron
last year.

In the past the $4 fee was
included in the comprehensive
fee for the school year. Those -
not wishing to contribute to
PIRG were instructed to sub-
tract $4 from their payment.
Now students must add $4 to
support PIRG.

According to Spencer, unless
students agree to reinstate the
previous system of funding in a
referendum this fall, Davidson
PIRG will have to rely solely. on
individual contributions.

The reason for the change,
Spencer explained, was that the

Tenure decisions cause junior professors to worry about job security

By TIM DWIGHT
Staff Writer

Davidson's untenured professors are
upset. They are worried because jobs in the
academic world are scarce and they feel that
tenure is no longer assured here. And as
shown by the recent tenure decisions, junior
professors sometimes have a tough time
finding out where they stand. This may
change now that the new Faculty Code of
Evalution is in effect, yet professors still
have their fears.

The common practice at Davidson in the
past has been to give tenure to almost
everyone eligible. The procedure was: come
to Davidson and walk into a tenured
teaching post.

Now Davidson is changing. The faculty
is filling with tenu-ed professors, the
Administration is tightening up its tenure
standards, and jobs outside Davidson are
hard to find. :

Davidson has always emphasized teach-
ing over publishing and prided itself on
good student-teacher relationships.

But with competition keener outside
where publishing is more important and
with junior professors realizing that tenure

not. automatic, the professors are

beginning to feel ‘‘The pressure is on to
publish more,”’ as one untenured professor
put it. ‘The pressure is on to get it done
and the pressure is on to get it done
quickly.”

But recent interviews with many unten-
ured professors indicate that they have not
changed their publishing habits. Most feel
they already publish enough. The profes-
sors did express concern over uncertainty
about the tenure standards.

All agreed that there needs to be more
communication between the Administra-
tion and the faculty long before tenure
decisions are made.

As one professor said, ‘“They should use
more systematic procedures in evaluation.
They should, at each stage of the process,
make the candidate aware of where he
stands. Evaluation is supposed to be a
cooperative process to improve teachers.”’

Another professor stated, ‘‘They should
give us comments as critical as possible and
as comprehensive as possible on all the
points in the Code.”

Untenured faculty members said that a
professor should be told ‘in writing” and
‘“fully’’ why he did not get tenure.

None of the untenured professors objec-
ted to the use of the faculty Code of

Evaluation. “It is excellent as an ideal
code” and ‘‘On paper, it’s fine,’ were two
comments expressed.

One professor did criticize its vagueness.
He said, “Il generally like it, but it is such
an Open document that it can be taken
many different ways.”

The main complaint with the Code was
that it lacked an arm for faculty input. Said
one junior professor, “I absolutely agree
that we should have a faculty Evaluation
Committee. Most of the untenured faculty
wanted it. I think Zimmermann and
Spencer wanted it.” A committee does not
exist because last year’s vote to form one
did not receive a two-thirds majority.

Another source of tension is ‘‘a vague
suspicion that the administration has some
tenure quota, ‘‘although most untenured
professors did not believe a quota was used.
All agreed that a quota would be stupid.

“A rigid tenure ceiling would be a
mistake,"’ commented one untenured pro-
fessor. “Before the Administration would
use any tenure ceiling they should think
very carefully about its effect on the morale
of the junior professors. Also, if the main
motive for it were to be saving money, then
it is wrong.”
