DR. LINGLE WAS STAR

Laird Is One of College’s
Three-Letter Men

The Davidson College faculty and
administration are not only well
supplied with Phi Beta Kappa keys
but are also well equipped with
gold “D's.” Some of Davidson's
best athletes of the
are

past century

now members of. the college
faculty and administration.

Dr. W. L. Lingle was a star play-
er on the Davidson baseball team
in 1892,

championship for that séason's play.

This team won the state
Dr. C. M. Richards was also a mem-
ber of this team and a star player.

Dr. M. E. Sentelle played two
sports. He played football and
tennis in 1894. Football at this time

ly organized
lege sport.

Dr. J. M. Douglas starred on the
Davidson College baseball team in
1893. This was Dr. Douglas’ senior
year at Davidson.

We have in the registrar’s office
the best baseball pitchers
ever to attend Davidson. Mr. F.
W. Hengeveld pitched varsity base-
ball three years and also played
varsity basketball three years. His
senior year he was elected captain
both of teams. In 1918,
his senior year, Mr. Hengeveld,
who was then known as “Dutch”
Hengeveld, won four of his five
games. The fifth game was against
Lenoir. “Dutch” allowed only two
hits yet he lost it 1 to 0 due to
errors in the infield.

Prof, W. N. Mebane, also of the
class of ‘18, starred with Mr.
Hengeveld on the basketball éourt.
Prof. Mebane played a fast game at
guard position while Mr. Hengeveld
jumped center for the Wildcats.

In Mr. G. Flake Laird we have
one of Davidson’s very few three-
letter men. Coach Laird played
three varsity years of football, three
varsity years of basketball, and two
years of varsity baseball. ‘ Coach
Laird’s name decorated many sport
pages during his four years at Dav-
idson as a student. He- won the
Norris Trophy cup his senior year,
the highest honor in sports at that
time.

Mr. A. H. (Pete) Whittle is one
of the very best trackmen ever to
trample the cinders for Davidson
College. Coach Whittle came to
Davidson from Atlanta, Ga. as a
freshman. He made the freshman
team with ease and was on the var-
sity tedttr his other three years. He
was captain of the track team in
1930. He also won the Decathon
Trophy in 1930. Mr. Whittle broke
the collegiate record in high hur-
dles in 1930. His new recerd was
15.2 seconds.

Another and more recent baseball
star is Prof. J. T. Kimbrough. Prof
Kimbrough played on the Wildcat
the seasons of

into a national

one of

of these

nine two seasons,
1923 and 1924.

A recent basketball star is Prof.
F. W. Johnston. Prof. Johnston
played three years of varsity bas-
ketball and three varsity
tennis. He was elected-captain-ef
both tennis and basketball teams
in 1930 and handed some splendid
ball playing to the fans that year.
He won -the state singles cham-
pionship in tennis jn 1930.

Dr. W. P. Cumming can well be
called the father of wrestling at
Davidson. When Dr. Cumming
came to Davidson from Japan, he

ling sport, having learned a great
deal of jiu jitsu from the Japanese.

HISTORICAL GIFT IS
GIVEN TO DAVIDSON

Colonel E. L. Baxter David-
son, ’81, Presents Fifty
Pamphlets to College

Colonel E. L. Baxter Davidson,
81, of Charlotte, recently presented
the Davidson College Library a
collection of over fifty pamphlets
pertaining to the histroy of David-
son College and Mecklenburg
County.

These pamphlets have been in
Col. Davidson’s possession for some
time, and form a Centennial Christ-
mas gift to the college.

The Mecklenburg material in-
cludes the prologue to the disputed
Mecklenburg Declaration published

by Col. Davidson, and a number
of other valuable items.
The Mecklenburg Declaration

was supposed td have been in P.
S. Ney’s mind when he wrote the
college motto for Davidson, “Alex-
enda Lux Ubi Orta Libertas.”

A rare volume of the Encyclo-
pedia of American Biography,
handsomely bound, contains ma-
terial on Col. Davidson’s family. The
statement appears in this volume
that “it can truthfully be said that
the financial support which came
to Davidson College from the Dav-
idson family became a tradition.”
Colonel Davidson himself has con-
tributed around $25,000 to the col-
lege.

FRIEND IN NEED...

My boy friend’s funny.

He doesn’t dance,. he doesn’t
drink.

You couldn’t get him into a
rumble

Seat on a moonlight night, on
a bet.

He wears the funniest clothes—

All

Black—no color to them at all.
He’s so quiet—never says a word,
He never laughs,

He's so formal, so cold, so infer-
nally stiff.
He died last week.

DAVIDSON MEN
HOLD OFFICES

Numerous Students Hold Posi-
tions in Young People’s
Organizations

STREET HIGH OFFICIAL

Four Presidents and Three
Vice-Presidents Here
Davidson College may feel proud
of her great number of officers in
the young people’s organizations of
the Southern Presbyterian church.
Of the seventeen synods of the
church, four presidents of the
Young People’s Leagues of these
states attend Davidson College.
These are Watson Street, president
of the young people of the Alabama
Synod; Frank Brown, president of
North, Carolina Young People;
Walter Dixon of South Carolina;
and Bill Brown of Georgia.

In addition to the four presidents
there are three vice presidents.
These are: Tom Anderson, of Ala-
bama; Monroe Wicker, of North
Carolina; and Sherrard Rice of

Virginia. There are several com-
mittee chairmen also who attend
Davidson,

Watson Street, besides being

president of the Young People of
the Synod of Alabama, is also pres-
ident of the entire General Assem-
bly of the Young People’s League
of the Southern’ Presbyterian
Church. He was elected to this
position at the meeting of the As-
sembly’s Council in Montreat last
summer. This is the highest posi-
tion that the Southern Presbyter-
ian Church has to offer a young
person.

Davidson should be proud to have
such boys, who are famous in the
church, in the college.

LOCAL ETA NU PI

(Continued from Page 5)
Also, during the week-end
Brother Thurston journeyed to the
W. C. U.N. C. chapter in Greens-
boro, where he planned to go over
the records of that chapter with the
local secretary.

SMITH BEGINS ALUMI
CHAPTER IN COLUMBIA

Conrad Frederick Smith, David-
son’s alumni secretary, journeyed to
Columbia, S. C., last Thursday night
for the purpose of organizing an
alumni chapter there. Coach Gene
McEver and Mr. Norman Shep-
hard accompanied him there and
they report a very successful meet-
ing. There were about twenty
Davidson alumni present.

Caldwell-Withers, '28, city editor
of The Columbia Record, was elect-
ed president of the group. It is
believed that this will be a lively
and helpful chapter.

Coach McEver made a short talk
on a subject which would naturally
be of a great deal of interest to
those in attendance. That is, the
prospects of Davidson’s 1937 foot-
ball team. His talk was most en-
joyable and the Columbia grads
have confidence that he will pro-
duce a winning team during his first
year as head coach.

Mr. Shephard also made a talk
there in which he stressed the piont
that athletics are gaining a strong
foothold in colleges and that they
are fast becoming a definite part of
the educational program. Fred
Smith spoke on plans for the Cen-
tennial celebration which takes
place next June.

Smith also announced that a
chapter will be organized in Flor-
ence before long which will include
all of eastern South Carolina.
Fred Smith was the guest of Ber-
nard Baruch on a hunting trip while
in South Carolina,

so suddenly that they have had no
time to think about anyone to take
his place. During “Mac’s” stay here
the whole student body has come to
know and love him, and his depar-
ture will cause a great breach in
life here at Davidson. .He has very
capably managed his duties at the

work to new heights.

Hal Overton Gives Talk Em-
phasizing Vast European
Expenditures

MAY PRESENT BANQUET

To Plan For Series of Spring
Programs

The International Relations Club
held its weekly meeting on last Fri-
day evening. The program for the
most part, consisted of a discussion
of the rapidly rising expenditures
of foreign countries for the pur-
pose of armaments.

Hal Overton gave a talk at the
meeting and in his remarks graph-
ically emphasized the enormous
amounts spent daily by various Eu-
ropean powers for re-arming. He
compared the costs of armaments
in Great Britain with the expendi-
tures of France, Germany, and Rus-
sia. He mentioned the fact that
England spends five million dollars
a day on her army and navy and
that Soviet Russia expended the
staggering amount of one hundred
and sixty million dollars daily in
1936 for armaments.

The I. R. C. will hold its regu-
lar meeting next Friday night. At
this time plans will be laid for a
series of spring programs.

A representative of the League of
Nations is to make a tour of the
United States in the near future
and is contemplating visiting David-
son College. The I. R. C. is dis-
cussing the possibility of present-
ing a banquet in honor of this gen-
tleman in case he decises to visit
here.
