@ O’Brien sinks a jumper.

Pulling out of a dry spell during
which the Wildcats dropped three of
five late-season conference games, John
Filar’s Wildcats defeated Furman
University’s Lady Paladins on Satur-
day afternoon in Greenville.

Davidson started slow, turning the
ball over six times while scoring only
five points in the first five minutes of
the game. Furman capitalized on Wild-
cat turnovers and sub-par shooting to
jump out to a 28-12 lead in the first half.

Filar called a time-out, and im-
plored his athletes: “We did not come
down here to do this!”

The *Cats then went on a 24-6 run
and pulled within a bucket, 36-34, at the
buzzer.

Kerry Brown paced the
‘Cats with 12 first-half points.
Her sister Jamie added 8, and
Janna Magette came off the
bench to contribute 7.

Led by a flawless shoot-
ing performance from Kerry
Brown (18 points, 7-7 FG, 4-4
FT), and Magette’s 4-of-8 from
the three-point arc, Davidson
pulled away from All-America
candidate Jackie Smith and
Furman in the second period.

“Not surprised at all,”
said point guard Jen O’Brien
of Kerry Brown’s perfection
on the night. “Kerry is such a
solid player. She has no fear,
she goes right to the basket.
She did everything, on offense
and defense, tonight.”

Davidson held Smith,
who is leading the Southern
Conference with almost 22
points and nine rebounds per
game, to but sixteen points on
the night. “One of our goals

for the day was not to lose
Jackie at all on defense,” said
Kerry Brown. “There was a
lot of communication out on
the court between the posts

nating Furman both in the posts and on
the perimeter.

Davidson knocked down four
three-pointers on the afternoon, all four
from freshman sharpshooter Magette.

and turning things around,” praised
Kerry Brown. “Not only her shooting,
but her defense was awesome as well.”
Twelve Wildcats saw floor time,
seven of them over ten minutes worth.
Kim Taylor and Jessica
Heath both played some
strong minutes in the post,
helping to contain the
Lady Paladins’ dominant
post players, Kena Hodges
and Jackie Smith. Smith
was last year’s Southern
Conference Player of the
Year, and was co-recipient
along with Jen O’ Brien for
pre-season player of the
year recognition for this
season.

It was not the lucki-
est of weeks for Jess
Montrella. The senior
fouled out with only’ four
points last Monday, though
she did score her 1000"
career point. On Saturday,
Montrella roared back with
14 points in 38 solid min-
utes of floor time, only to
be inadvertently tripped by
a Paladin defender with less
than a minute to play.
Montrella slammed her
forehead on the hardwood,
splitting a cut above her
right eye that required seven
stitches.

and we did a good job of con-

Scoring nearly 80 points per game
on 47% shooting, the Wildcat offense
ranks among the nation’s twenty best.
But in the five games leading up to
Saturday’s, the ‘Cats had been slump-
ing to an average of only 63 points per
game. On Saturday, Kerry Brown and
company shot 58% from the floor and
70% from the charity stripe while domi-

“When Janna’s hitting them,” said
O’Brien, “I don’t think anyone can hit
them any better. And she also drew that
critical charge against Jackie (Smith)
and came through with a ton of steals.
Her whole game was just money to-
night.”

“It’s a tribute to these seniors,”
said Carter Kelly. “They’ ve been a hun-

Conference with just two regular sea-
son conferences games to play.

Men drop late-season conference game to ETSU, swept by’Bucs for first time in fifteen years.

With just one week remaining in
the regular season and Davidson in a

dead heat against
Davidson _73 Appalachian
ETSU 82 State for the

North Division
regular season championship, the Wild-
cat machinery sputtered and then stalled
against East Tennessee State last Sat-
urday night.

Davidson and ASU entered the
weekend tied atop the North Division
with identical conference records ‘of
10-3. But ETSU handed Davidson their
fourth conference loss of the season,
improving the Bucs’ record to 9-5. The
loss marked only Davidson’s second in
ten games. ETSU swept the season
series with Davidson for the first time
since the ‘82-’83 season.

The Wildcats shot 40% from the
floor and a dismal 57% from the charity
stripe, compared to ETSU’s 46% and
68%, respectively.

“T’d like to credit East Tennessee
to playing a superb defensive game,”
said Coach Bob McKillop. “They com-
pletely negated our ability to score on
the interior.” —

It would be fair to say that the men

in the zebra stripes played an active role
on the night. While the teams made a
combined 48 field goals on the evening,
the officials whistled in 62-fouls, con-
tributing to 77 free throw attempts and
nearly a two and a half hour game.

“Rhythm did not exist tonight for
us,” commented McKillop. “Maybe the
rhythm did not exist tonight because
they were 62 fouls called.

“We never got into an offensive
thythm because the game was continu-
ally stopped and we never were able to
score in the post. We were unable to
score out of our transition game, and
(ETSU) always answered. They always
put us on our heels, and we were con-
stantly digging out of a hole.”

ETSU led 35-31 at the half, and
pulled away with about three minutes
to play in the game on a pair of 3-point
field goals from Gabe Lisicky.

“You give up six points on two
possessions like that, it makes things
difficult,” admitted McKillop.

maintaining his position as the third-

Junior Davor Halbauer led the

team in scoring with 16 points, 12 of
them came on his four of eight shoot-
ing from behind the arc. Ben Ebong
added 13 points and a game-high 11
rebounds.
With the loss, Davidson falls a
game behind Appalachian State in the
North Division standings. The ‘Cats
will travel to Appalachian State on
Saturday, and provided they beat
Wofford last night and Appalachian
this weekend, Davidson will still
emerge as the top seed in the North
Division.

“We have to respond to the adver-
sity of not playing very good basket-
ball,” said McKillop. “We have to reen-
gage the trust in the system, and can’t
deviate from it and can’t go off on a
tangent thinking we have to change ev-
erything or create a new plan of attack.
Our plan of attack system is very effi-
cient and very good to us. We cannot
panic at this point and think it’s the

than the actual players on
Saturday night.”
