WELCOME ALUMNI!

Davidson’s student body and faculty this
week-end extend a very hearty welcome to
our returning alumni and their friends at
this, Davidson’s 1940 Homecoming celebra-
tion.

No doubt there will be many men back
for the first time in a number of years, and
to them we say that it is hoped. they can
be with us at more Homecoming’ in the
future. To those who have been able to
attend regularly, we extend a welcome once
again. It is a fine thing that s0 many former
‘students can reunite once each year on their
old campus.

Many changes have taken place through
the years, and especially during the past
year. Davidson has been fortunate this last
year in securing donations which enable
the trustees to authorize construction of
two new buildings, the library and chemis-
try buildings. Also the are lights on the
football field niake Davidson’s stadium very
up-to-date, and adds much to the college’s
athletic facilities. Our alumni will surely be
pleased to note these improvements.

Our present students will. endeavor to
make this week-end an outstanding attrac-
tion each year, and this year, as always, will
be glad at any time to do anything possible
to help any alumnus, friend or guest. Home-
coming is put on in honor of our alumni,
and we want to see every one of them, be-
sides all others, have a fine visit to David-
son. Again may we welcome you, and ask
you to return in the near future.

BE THERE!

Friday night Joe Shelton and his junior
assistants plan the biggest Pep Rally of the
year. While definite plans are not known at
this writing, it has been stated that the
Pep Meeting will be “monstrous, superb,
and colossal,” to quote one of the cheer-
leaders. :

We-wish-to-urge-every student to attend
this rally. Last week our team/was beaten
badly at Greenville. This is no time to alibi
or go over that game again. But we have
to get in behind that team, back it all the
way, win or lose, and show them that we
are for them.

Friday night theré will be a number of
girls on the campus. Instead of using the
fact that you have a date for an excyse, why
not show her what a real Davidson Pep
Meeting is, and something of ‘what the Da-

vidson spirit is? The right place for every
man in the student body on Friday night at

across such an outstanding editorial that we
think it deserves to be read by Davidson
students as well as others.

“Europe is a madhouse. China is reeling
under the cannon biows of Japan. Spain has
tottered before the onslaught of Fascist
Franco. The United States has warned the
Axis that it will tolerate no’ foolishness.
The world is arming, and fighting.

“But I don’t want to die.

“I’m just starting life. I’ve seen but
little of the world and I want to see more.
But I want to see more of a peaceful world,
not one torn with passion and bleeding with
hysteria. Yet, ironically, because of my age
and physical condition I shall probably be
called in the first draft when the United
States declares war. But I don’t want to die.

“T shall have to shoulder a rifle, even
though I don’t want to. I shall be asked to
shoot down my fellow men whom I have
never seen and against whom I have no
grudge, with whom I would rather be friend-
ly. I shall have to shoot him’ before he
shoots me, whom he has never seen and
against whom he has no grudge, with.whom
he would rather be friendly.

“Why do I hayg to go to war? Why
should I have to go to war? There is no rea-
son in the wide world why I should be forced
to shoulder a rifle and take part in whole-
sale destruction. I’m young and there is no
season why I should die—defending my
country against invasion by fighting on a
battlefield in England ‘or Germany.

“But what chance have we, the youth who
must.lose our_lives, when_that-military..mu-
sic starts, when the band swings down the
street? What chance have we when the
worms scream at us, ‘Will you go or must

* What chance have we when the high-
a propagandists turn out atrocity
stories by the dozen, vividly imagining how
foreign women and children are being tor-
tured and killed?

“Why must we have war? Why cannot
we be rational? Why must we damn the
youth of another nation for something they
have not done? Why must we kill these
youths, protecting our frontiers in Europe?
Why. must we be such asses as to plunge
wildly into an abysmal war that may end
in a return to barbarism?

“Tam not afraid to defend my country,
but I do not want to defend others when
I live in America. I do not want war. I DO
NOT WANT TO DIE ee auy, Northwest-

With The Staff

Since Homecoming this year falls imme-
diately after Hallowe’en not much attention
has been given to this widely recognized
night. On this campus-no dafices or parties
will recognize it,.as has been done in the
past, and it will probably pass with a mini-
mum of practical pranks, However, it might
be interesting to some to look at the tradi-
tion kehind Hallowe’en, and at some of the
superstitions that have grown up around it.

The majority of superstition conéerning
Hallowe'en started. back in ancient Ireland
and Britain (so we are informed). There
the people thought that on the night preced-
ing All Saints’ Day, Saman, God of Death,
forced the spirits of the condemned to enter
the bodies of criminals. From this came the
legend-that if witches greased a broomstick
and slept with it under their pillows they
would be transformed into a. spirit, with
magical powers which would enable them
to fly with these Broomsticks.

Many superstitions soorf grew up about
methods for girls to find out who the one
man should be. One such superstition held
that if a ball of twine were thrown out of
the window, when it was rewound the fu-
ture lover of the maiden would be on the
rope’s end. Others preferred to climb the
cellar stairs at midnight and look into a hand
mirror by the aid of a candle held_in the left
hand, where the image of the future lover
would appear.

Another interesting superstition con-

cerned peeling atarge-red-apple,-so that the

peel remained in one piece. This peel, when

Sometimes we could almost wish
that we had never finished college

Goodbye in the Night

He was a star back on one of
the local college elevens last year.
She was a dewy-eyed freshman
from North Carolina and “adored”

Last week he rode sadly away

Subtle Explanation

The other night we stopped in
at Madison Square Garden to see
the cowhands who have crowded
out on Uncle Mike Jacobs and Jhis
boxers, and landed smack behind
a party of Brooklyn’ College coeds.

ers call it, was something they had

cowboy sporting a red shirt was
having a time with one of the stub-
born critters. She jumped and she
kicked, She lunged at him and sent
him flying. Finally four cowboys
rode herd’ on her and hustled her

away.
“Now you see,” quoth one of the
girls, “why milk is so high. It takes

so many men to catch one of those
things so they can milk him.”

The Right People

A merry Yale sophomore recent-
ly invited ‘a sheltered young thing
from Vassar to Néw York for ‘her
first view of Manhattan night life,

She arrived with a determined
female spinster who informed the
Yale that there would be no trek-
king to the dens of evil in Green-
wich Village. Only sweetness and
light for her innocent. Dancing was
permissible but only where the
“right people” go.

They landed knee deep in debu-
tantes at the first Saturday Night
Supper Club in the chi-chi Pierre.

No sooner had the trio been seat-
ed than George Malcolm, of the
cafe socialite Malcolms, tweaked
the nose of Ted Peckham, late en-
trepreneur of an escort service.
Mr. P. countered with a left hook.

Debbies fled screaming into the
night. The Yale’s table was over-
turned in the sciiffle and landed ‘in
the stamach of the female Cer-
berus.

They ended up in the compara-
tive quiet of one of the hottest
bistros in Greenwich Village.

Devil’s Pipe Line—Although we

what it is about. The story centers
around a fight racket where every
young fighter tries to make the
big top. The leader, Lemon, gives
only his friends a break while he
cuts the others after having used
them for a little publicity. His two
best men are finally given the gate,
but that was his fatal mistake. The
two strong young men rise up
against their crooked and snoeping
friend and throw him in a tank of
boiling red paint.'Can they beat
the rap? Well, you come and see

to giveone of his best perform-

just how it turns out.

Homecoming is practically here.
Tomorrow night the festivities
start, with the first dance set of

and his boys swinging out.

Sparkplug of Johnson’s band is
Bob Hartsell, piano player and ar-
ranger, who hails from Salisbury.
Bots played solo piano with the
“Louisiana Kings” when they were
the up and coming band of the
nation some four years ago. Favor-

of the band is listening to Hart-|
sell beat it out on the keyboard.

Backbone of the horns is Kim-
ball, first trumpet, who was for-
merly with Glen Miller. He takes
most of the trumpet solos, and will
make you hold your breath when
he starts after those high notes, and
he never-misses for he has an edu-
cated, iron lip.

Kimball’s sidekick and_ alternate |
first-trumpet in the band is Emery
Stevenson, freshman at Davidson
last year, who has transferred to

the music for his hair, which is
about two feet long. He and Harry
Lee Clark, who plays first sax,
annoy Carolina supporters by play-
ing “Oh, Davidson” at inopportune
moments. Harry Lee attended Da-
vidson for two-years and was the
backbone of Chubby King’s band
of a few years ago.

Tommy Pharr, newest member
of the band, is from Charlotte and
features in the trombone slot. You
should get some nice kicks from

[his sweet solos.

Johnson’s is one of the finer
bands of the South, featuring a
five-man sax team in which Freddy
plays alto, and many kick arrange-
ments by Hartsell.. The vocal. de-

Miss Gloria Missel, and a very

ON VARIOUS COQUETRIES
EMPLOYED BY YOUNG LADIES
IN THE BALLROOM TO INSURE
PROMPT BREAKING:

Perhaps the most common stag-
bait employed by modern beauties
is the tried and true phrase: “Come
back—I've got something’ te tell
you.” When the young gallant
rushes back to receive this impor-
tant communication, he is never
quite able to get out of the young
lady just what she meant, but he
receives further meaningful and
sly glances, and thus taps scores
of her partners on’ the shoulder
throughout the evening.

Again the coquette is quick to
establish a bond in common with

thereby to know at least a dozen
people that he knows. She can thus
employ stock“remarks in convers-
ing about them and make the av-
erage undergrad feel that he has
indeed won friends and influenced
people.

Again many. “a. lively evening is
insured by flattering the dancing
of the powerless college. man... His
reaction to this.is immediate, and
he promptly vows to impress his
mastery “of the dance on her
throughout the course of the eve-
ning.

‘She young ladies new to the wiles
of ballroom coquetry have used

to great advantage the most ‘fun-|

damental of all stag-stoppers—
namely, the wink. The success of
this artifice is practically assured
and, as it is relatively simple to
execute, it is indeed one of the
most popular ways and means.

A few of the more farsighted in
the sisterhood are well-informed
enough to blow up visiting Pan-
Hellenic men with an eye to fu-
ture cotillions and figures. This
choice bait is generally reserved
to the more veteran of the trot-
ters, however.

There are certain mechanical -de-
vices which are in~general usage
also. The pat on the back is said to
be generally effective, while the
hand-squeéze is very pertinent to
any situation also.

Every competent trotter has seen
the collegian somewhere before.
That is, she creates for him the
illusion that he has been around,
and as this is much satisfying to
the “vanity, it is a very effective
means. Sime

The young” ladies work on “the.
Principle also that everyone is a
senior, Freshmen have been known
to break time and again. on trot-
ters employing this simple artifice.

Again the trotters’ creed recog-
nizes every fraternity as the best.
There is nothing quite so able, to
raise the collegian to the heights
as to realize that his is te best
fraternity.
