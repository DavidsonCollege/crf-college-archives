While warm, summer breezes were luring col-
lege students from houks to beaches, the masters of
the Southern Conference were busy finagbing their
way out of a Ught little problem: expense. And their
solution may have signaled the end of freshman
athletics In this conference.

The masters of the comference didn't need Ed
Dwelle and THE DAVIDSONIAN to tell them that
athletics eat up a healthy chunk of a college's budget,
As schools in the conference further accelerate their
athletic programs, the cust of malniaining such an
outfit wil also inerease and place even heavier burdens
on institutions in the future, The moguls knew some-
thing had 1o give—and It did.

What “gave” was the froshman inoligibility
rulo, which had prevented frashmen from com:
peting on varsity teams since the rule was enacted

Conference Rule May Endanger Frosh Athletics

at the end of World War It. Tha conference ruled
this summer that freshman ore now eligible for
enmpalition on varsity teams except football and
boskotball.

Like most explanations of major policy changes,

the one that accompanied this was covered with syru
platitudes that secmed to sidestep the real isstie. The
reason most often given for the change was that the
old system hampered young athletes’ develapment.
This line rensoned that if was a shame that an out-
standing athlate had to wait a full year before he could
accrue the benefits of superior coaching and more
demanding competition that he would meet on the
varally. -
As ove athletic director said, why should a boy
who con run a 9.6 hundred yard dash have to wait
until he's a sophomore before he can campete in a
varsity ineet? Makes sense, doesn't it?

Toa point, yes. But of course, thera are a fow
flaws in that reassoning. Not all sports attectod
by the cule change are individual sports. For
example, soccer. A talented boy might better
bonofit from a year on a freshman team, where his
superior abilities migh! make him more of a leader
than he might become if facod with lougher com-
petition on the varsity.

The other oft given explanation is that a talented
aihtete might benefit more from the superior coaching
ona varsity. That's nice loo, except that most schools
in the conference do not maintain separaie coaching
siaffs for freshmen in the affected sports. Mosl schools
just double-up. with varsity coaches assuming a heavier
load. But so mitch for that anvway.

FRESHMAN FOOTBALLERS GET (NSTRUCTIONS FROM COACH BOB BROWN
“Wo want to Indoctrinate the team into Wildcat football”

Flickerball Heads IMAC Calendar

8 #4

ww £ a

Through the usual barrage of malarky comes one
explanation which we suspect might be the main one:
expense. In the words of Walt Drewry, Sports Infcr-
mation Director at Richmond, “We just don't have
staffs large enough to handle varsity and freshman
teams in inost cases, and it's too expensive."

Drewry's statement was backed up by other men
in the conference. Including Eddie Tengue of The
Citadel and C. L. “Duke” Ellington at Virginia Military
Institute. All said the economic factor was a major
reason. We suspect it is the major reason, since, of
course, the problem of staffing freshman teams Ly
directly related to ihe expense. If It's not, then we
sugyest hiring more coaches.

Even cansidering the expense, most schools
plan to continue some kiad of a freshman pro-
pram, even though their best freshman athietos
imight be shanghaied bo the varsity. Eddie Teaque,
athletic director af The Citadel, said his school
will continue freshinan programs In the affected
sports and he foresaw no plan to eliminate them.
However, ho admitted freshmon programs are in
trouble,

‘There is a danger that some schools may pui all
their good athletes in the varsity program.” he sald,
“and make freshman athletics about like the juniot
varcity programs in high school. We don’t want to
Tuin the freshman program, but each school must
decide for itself how to manage freshman sports.”

Drewry said Richmond will not field freshman
teains in golf and tennis. Since freshmen are still in
eligible for basketball and faotball, they will, of cunrse,
field freshman teams in these sports,

Even though most schools will nat wipe out
their freshmen taams this searan, we feel that
the ond of all freshmen sports Is near. Since it is
expensive to operate froahmon teams, athletic
diractors in the fulure will be under considorable
pressure from the colleges to save money by
erasing frashman sports.

Tf you can reasan that it's cheaper to put good
freshmen on the varsity, thea you can reason ibat it's
even cheaper to put ali of them there. Perhaps golf
and tennis coachos of the future might implement a
wud syslom, whereby all candidates, freshmen aind vat-
sity, would compete for positions, Those who failed
emald join the IMAC.

Then of course, il’s only a short step 10 removing
restrictions on basketball and football players. Ac-
coriling lo many directors. the only reason these sports
Were oot incladed is that faculty members in member
schools felt that playing on these teams drained tuo
much time which a freshman could better spend
studying or settling down.

Someday fhey may realize just how much
freshman football and basketball players practice,
and then dacide if they’d practica much more on
the varsity.

The end of fresiiman athletics would he unfor-
tuiate. Freshman athletics give boys who could never
Star on the varsity one last craek at competition in in-
termural sports. For athletes with outstanding poten-
tial, it provides a year to farther develop team leader-
ship and gain valuable experience needed to'make the
transition from varsity to college competition.
