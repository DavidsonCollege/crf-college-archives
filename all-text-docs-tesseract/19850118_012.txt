IMAC Basketball: 50 Teams Take To The Courts

By HUNTER GOURLEY

IMAC’ers abandoned the flickerball
fields and headed south for the winter —
to the basketball courts inside Johnston
Gym. The 1984 IMAC basketball season
got underway in early December. And
basketball, probably a more familiar pas-
time for most sportsters than flickerball,
met with a big turnout.

These sports enthusiasts included
jocks, ex-jocks, former junior and high
school standouts, mere role players, un-
happy bench warmers, weight watchers,
and assorted pot-bellied and balloon-bot-
tomed hacks — enough people at least to
field some fifty teams. That’s nine
women’s basketball teams, nine men’s
A-league teams, and a whopping 32-
team, five-division men’s B-league.

In the brief post-Thanksgiving 1984
half of the season, 34 games were franti-
cally played in the vain attempt to beat
the inevitable onslaught of before-holi-
day testing and paper-writing.

Women’s League Games

Rusk opened the season with a con-
vincing win over a freshman team, Sec-
ond Richardson Deuces Wild. Both
teams benefitted from fairly diverse scor-
ing. Of course, Rusk obviously benefit-
ted more in the 48-12 victory. Jan With-
ers led all scorers with 14 points, fol-
lowed closely by Mary Edwards with 12,
and Michelle Kresken and Susan Taylor
hitting 8 apiece. Kelley Malone bagged a
third of the Deuces’ total points.

BEP and F becomes a charter mem-

ber of the Rout of the Month Club with its |

unmerciful demolition of fourth Rich’s
Cloud Nine, 51—5. Dana Lemon hit for

28 points while Janet Bitter was the solo
scorer for the storm Clouds. The Subter-
ranean Devils crawled out of the base-
ment to earn Rich its first basketball vic-
tory of the young season. The Devils
trounced F & M’s Little Miss Trouble
and the Mellifluous Poptarts, 25—10.

Coach Pat Daley led the Old Ladies
to victory in a 26~7 game against Shrieks
at Midnight with her 15-point outing.
Dean of Students Sue Ross provided the
tenacious defense for the Ladies, collect-
ing four big fouls. Daley sank eight shots
in a 30-24 beating of sometime-power
Rusk.

The other rival eating house, and also
perennial power, Warner Hall’s Court
Cases gobbled up F & M’s Little Miss
Trouble, 45-10. Annie Porges Becca
Bates, and Debbie Podolin combined for
one half of the Cases’ points.

For those people who love happy en-
dings, the once down-and-out Deuces
Wild rebounded from their opening sea-
son loss to Rusk and claimed victories
over Rich rivals, the Devils, in a 21-14
game, and the luckless Cloud Nine, 36—
14. Deuces’ Max Curry hit for 10 ineach
game.

Men’s League Play

The Ubbies started the season off
right with a 83-38 drubbing of Second
East Belk. There were five Ubbies’ scor-
ers in double figures. Jay Poag led the
pack with 22 points, Lou Krempel hit for
a solid 17, while Mike Cate, Doug Neil,
and Scott Morrison got 10 apiece. Pat
Millen and Donald Davis led the Easter’s
with nine points each.

The Ubbies continued their high-
scoring, rim-banging streak by turning

off the volume on Allowed Liquid
Sound, 48-28. Cate was high scorer with
17 while the Sound’s Tyler Long hit for
12. Slaughter remained the trend as the
Bud Men from PiKA cut off third east
Belk’s Third. Legs, 45-14, and Ema-
non’s Midnight Train overran the Skeets
of Third West, 49-21.

In other, more evenly matched
league play, the SPE’s Unmentionables
beat the Fiji Purple Cadillacs, 51-43, ina
prestigious victory in what may be the
final year of the hotly-contested rivalry
between the two off-campus frats. Jody
McClain smoked the nets for the Purple
Cads with seven hits for 14 points. Joe
Moss was MVP with 24 in Yeast Belch’s
65—42 win over Emanon’s Debbie’s
Bums. Dick Shea went to the hoop for 21
of Moses and the Promised Land’s 69
points in their six-point overthrow of the
Ruling Coalition.

Starrcade °84 fell to the Collapsible
Rims despite the Dave Flowers-Steve
Soud Show, who combined for 24
points. Second west’s Slamming Sec-
onds wiped third center’s C-Men off the
court, 49-28, behind Aaron Edward’s
seven buckets. John Ponder’s 14-point
debut enabled the Women of Vietnam to
destroy the Purple Cads, 36—25.

Belk’s third center Bliff’s Yodeling
Ogres outscored the Ward 20-11, with
Matt Newsome tallying 12 points and
Jeff Carter taking home the honors for
the Ward with 8. The Ogres and Ward
currently share the Wheelchair award for
their respective efforts in the lowest-
scoring men’s game prior to Christmas,
successfully out-underscoring the Ariel
Circus’ three-point Sleeper over Book of

the Month Club, 28-25. The Heat-Seek-
ing Monster Missiles squeaked past
KA’s Dunderheads 28-25, and PiKA’s
Manson Family Singers fell to second
center Belk’s Hot Rocks, 30—26, in other
potential wheelchair games.

Men’s A-League Games

Last but not least, Men’s A-league
basketball. Becca and the Huts kept their
cool, barely beating BSC’s Breeze in a
37-36 greaser. Dave Turner took game
honors with 14 points, while Jim Sow-
erby and Will Cardwell combined for 23
of Becca’s points. The Hod Squad from
SAE had a difficult time for awhile
against rival frat PiKA’s tough junior
team, Three Seconds, in their five-point
victory, 47-42. Scott Brandon proved to
be the dominating force in the game,
contributing 22 to the overall Hoddy ef-
fort.

The mostly freshman squad, Death
by Ru Ru, shocked the older Pax team,
Basket Cases, knocking off the bigger
Bigger and Brechtelsbauer-led team 67—
3. Former Wildcat Billy Naso hit for 16
for the victors. Ru Ru went on to keep the
Cool Breeze slack with a three-point vic-
tory, 37-34. Charles Showers hit eight
baskets to lead all scorers.

Three Seconds got one in the win col-
umn by out lasting the hapless Old Men,
52-43, with Alan Futral contributing 17.
Undefeated Hod Squad evened ‘Becca
and the Huts’ record at 1-1 with a hard-
fought 39-36 victory. Finally, the de-
fending IMAC champions, Supreme
Court, successfully cefended its title
against SAE’s Far Side in a lackluster
44-37 performance.
