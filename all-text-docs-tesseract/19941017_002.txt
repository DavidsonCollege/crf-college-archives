French JYA program moves from Montpelier to Tours

By Beth Lindsey

Due to an increase in student
demand for French programs
abroad, the French department has
announced that beginning with the
1995-96 school year, its abroad
program will be moved from Mont-
pelier to Tours.

French Professor Alan
Singerman explains, “The enroll-
ment in the year-long program was
slipping, while more and more
Davidson students were choosing
to enroll in the abroad programs at
other schools in order to have the
semester option. As a department,
we feel a strong need to serve the
students at Davidson first and fore-
most, though we will continue to
accept students from other
schools.”

After much research, the
French department concluded that
Montpelier could not provide a
quality semester program. “The
[academic] structures in Montpe-
lier simply don’t accommodate the
strong semester program there,”
says Singerman.

He cites overcrowding of
Montpelier schools as another rea-
son for the move. “It has been
increasingly difficult for students
to get places in classes, and the
humanities division is terribly over-
populated,” says Singerman. The
department made its decision with
student interests at heart.

Although professors were
hesitant to abandon the connec-

tions and established relationship
with the school in Montpelier, they
recognized the many advantages
of the Tours program. “The loca-
tion is very beneficial,” says
Singerman. Tours is located in the
Loire Valley, less than an hour
from Paris and in the midst of
beautiful Renaissance castles. It
has a moderate climate and is also
regarded as the gastronomical cen-
ter of France.

Another advantage of the
Tours program is the quality of
education at both the Institut de

_Tourain and the University of

Tours. These schools will provide
Davidson students with both se-
mester and year-long programs.
Also, the Institut is “one of the
finest language and civilization
institutes in France. Many stu-
dents have gone there and have
come back with glowing reports,”

says Singerman..

Carolyn Ortmayer, active co-
ordinator of the Study Abroad Of-
fice, is currently developing the
logistics of the abroad program in
Tours for the 1995-96 year. - “It
will begin in a language school in
Paris for three weeks and then will
move onto Tours,” says Ortmayer.
Singerman will be the resident di-
rector for both the semester and the
year-long programs in 1995-96.

flyers paper
dorm walls

By Meg Wolff

On Saturday morning, women
in both Richardson and Cannon
dorms awoke to an unwanted sur-
prise—offensive flyers had been
placed either in their halls or on the
doors to their halls and on the en-
trances to the buildings.

Typed to look like a standard
informational bulletin, the flyers
made derrogatory sexual remarks
toward Davidson women. Graphic
and offensive in nature, the flyers

' were signed “from all the men out
there.”

Junior Hall Counselor Kristi
Kops found one Saturday morning
on the front door of Cannon. While
none seemed to appear on
upperclass women’s halls, copies
were slipped underneath the doors
of Warner Hall, Rusk, and Connor.

Hall Counselors Rosie
Molinary, Jill Dyer, and others plan
to take flyers to Dean of Students
Tom Shandley and Assistant Dean
Leslie Marsicano today. Not sure

what course of action to take next, .

Molinary thinks there will be co-
ed programming amongst the fresh-
man halls that deal with this issue.
“Obviously this is an unhealthy
response to frustration, and itneeds
“to be dealt with,” says Molinary.

Dyer finds the flyers offen-
sive and humorless: “It’s so offen-
sive and not even funny—f it is
supposed to be a joke, there is just
no point.”

The semester program will take
place in the fall.

Some participants in last
year’s French abroad program in
Montpelier are dismayed by the
switch. Senior Milica Tomasevic
explains that she enjoyed. the
warmer climate, the proximity to
beaches, and the atmosphere.
“Montpelier is really a university
city.’ It was so much fun to be able
to meet so many students from
both France and from other coun-
tries. I can’t imagine it being that
way in another city,” says
Tomasevic. °

Senior Anna Watkins under-
stands the need for change and
strongly supports the decision to
incorporate a semester-long pro-
gram. “Though I really wanted to
go for the whole year to get a true
understanding of the culture and to
become fluent, there are many
French students who cannot afford
to spend that much time abroad for
various reasons and really need the
semester option. This will incor-
porate so many more students in
the abroad program.”

Despite the semester option,
the French department encourages
majors to go for a year in order to
obtain a more beneficial experi-
ence, both culturally and linguisti-
cally. Students interested in the
programs should attend a general
information meeting on Novem-
ber 1 at 6:30 p.m. in Chambers
211.
