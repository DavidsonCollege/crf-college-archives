requests in Hall's behalf have
been made in the past, and the
votes have usually been close.
‘However, Meredith was
much more positive last night
than has been the case in the
past,’ Butner suggested.

Hall presented a report to
the Senate and answered
questions on his current ac-
tivities. “At times I have had
to make appointments three
weeks in advance. More and
more students are using my
services, and | can't un-
derstand why I was cut back
by the administration instead
of expanded,”’ he commented.

The formal contract hasn't
been drafted yet, but Munce’s
committee is expected to sub-
mit it to the Senate for ap-
proval in the near future. ‘‘We
will emphasize Dr. Hall's
clinical psychology services,
and hope also to achieve
flexibility, better com-
munication, and an emphasis
on the SGA’s active role in
counseling,’’ Munce said.

“Also, the college hasn't
budgeted him (Dr. Hall) for
group counseling activities,
and this will be changed,”
Butner added.

In other business, Senator
Bob Penny reported on his ef-
forts to establish a non-credit
typing course for Davidson
students. According to Penny,
the course is ready to begin
next fall.

The SGA Senate will handle
registration and will sell the
textbooks. Mrs. Snider of the
Fine Arts Department will
teach the course.

And in other business, the
Senate approved a charter for
the Davidson Christian
Fellowship.

The Congressman also calls
for a more effective and ef-
ficient change to a peace-time
economy.

Reverend Young said that
much of the nation's inflation
is caused by corrupt gover-
nment officials.

“The wheat deal, for in-
stance, was a political move
on the part of Nixon which
drastically hurt our economy.
I also have suspicions about
the oil crisis.

“The whole black political
awakening in this country is
cause for optimism,”’ he said.

“Blacks are everywhere
challenging whites in elec-
tions. Even when the black
candidates lose, the whites
usually become more respon-
Sive to poor people's needs,”’

observes Young.

Additional reasons for
Young’s optimism include the
increasing number of young
black and white Southerners
elected to Congress and the
recent attempts by Congress
to pass various welfare
measures.

Young agreed that a large
majority of blacks normally
vote Democratic.

... Young Chastises Nixon

“I wouldn't be surprised if
that vote completely turns
around in the 1976 election. It
could happen if the Democrats
turn conservative and choose
Henry Jackson as their can-
didate and the Republicans
respond with, say, a Gerry
Ford-Edward Brooke ticket,”
speculates Young.

Young said that his ministry
brought him into politics.

“I realized that the com-
munities I preached to were
being cheated out of decent
jobs, good wages, and voting
rights. Ten years ago we
didn't even have the vote.”

The Georgia Congressman
observed that churches are
quite powerful as a political
voice.

“What other organizations
besides churches, have
regular once-a-week meetings
of 300 to 500 people?’ asked
Young.

He further commented that
Biblical scriptures have often
given him inspiration for
political proposals.

In Congress Young par-
ticipates on committees
dealing with banking, finance,
and international trade.
