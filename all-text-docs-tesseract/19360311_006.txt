Turkish tobacco is expensive. The
import duty alone is 35 cents a pound.
But no other place except Turkey and
Greece can raise tobacco of this par-
ticular aroma and flavor.

the correct proportions to bring out
the finer qualities of each tobacco,
helps to make Chesterfields outstand-
ing for mildness and for better taste.

Phi Society Initiates
Six Men at Meetings

At a meeting held on March the
third, the Philanthropic Literary
Society initiated Six new members,
who are: B. J. Reed, W. F. Bell, W.
C. Johnston, K. M. MelIntyre, J. Y.
Templeton, and J. C. McClure, Jr.
Other men who were unable to at-
tend this initiation because of un-
avoidable business will be initiated
later.

Also a debate was held that was
a discussion of the theory: Re-

absolute control the student
publications, J. H. Gailey, Jr., and
H. L. Harkey took the affirmative
side, while F. M. Mack and J. F
