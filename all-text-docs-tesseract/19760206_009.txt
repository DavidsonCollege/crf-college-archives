Colbert joins Cats; g
follows Tousignant

Jim Colbert has been named
assistant football coach at
Davidson, according to a
statement released by the
off ic Athletic Director Tho-
mas Cartmill.

Colbert, who has been head
football coach at Smyrna High
School in Smyrna, Delaware
for the past four years, re-
places Robert Tousignant, who
resigned to enter private busi-
ness. Colbert will serve as
offensive coordinator for the
Wildcat squad.

The Wing-T offense which
Davidson uses has been Col-
bert’s speciality since he play-
ed for the University of Dela-
ware, where he graduated in
1972.

‘‘Jim brings a particular
technical,.expertise which
should be extremely important
in the development of our
offense,’’ said Davidson head
football coach Ed Farrell. ‘“He
was an outstanding quarter-

back at Delaware and ran the
Wing-T, our basic offense.
And he has _ successfully
coached it for the last four
years.

“His playing and coaching
experience will bring the fine
points to our offense that are
necessary to be successful.
Tubby Raymond (head coach
at Delaware) said that he has
never had a quarterback who
had a better understanding of
the Wing-T,’’ he said.

Colbert has posted a 29-10-1
record in his four years at
Smyrna, including a second
place finish in the 1975 state
championship.

Tousignant has been with
the Davidson squad since
Farrell joined the staff two
years ago. Tousignant was
also an assistant under Farrell

The Davidson girls’ basket-
ball team split its last two
games, winning over Guilford
College 82-54 in a home game
tuesday night and losing to
Anderson Junior College 47-73
in another home game Jan-
uary 28.

The Guilford game was the
stage for at least two school
records for the Lady Wildcats
as they scored 82 points and
Beth Tanner passed for ten
assists. The Guilford game
was probably the bast game
the Lady Wildcats haveplayed
all year. As assistant coach
Ken Schmader summed it,
“We finally put it all together;
it was an excellent team
effort.”’

Donna Sherrill and Renee
Soos led the scoring against
Guilford, hitting 22 points
apiece. Beth Tanner chipped
in 18 more points to go with
her ten assists.

Katherine Morton also had
one of her best games as she
hauled in a game high 14
rebounds. Davidson collected
66 rebounds in all.

The halftime score was 42-
34. In the first ten minutes of
the second half, the Lady Cats
racked up an amazing 37
points, most of it coming off of
good fast breaking and tight
defense. According to Schma-
der, it was Davidson’s height
advantage which broke the
game open.

‘‘We had a height advan-
tage which helped us on the
boards and allowed us to make
the outlet pass,’’ he said.

Wildcat ladies embarass Guilford

guards quickly it was easy for
us to fast bread and put on a
burst of scoring.” ‘

Despite the tough defense.
two Guilford women had good
games. Cyd Atkins pumped in
19 rebounds. and Wanda Rob-
bins hit 20 points and puled
down 14 rebounds.

The Guilford trampling had
to be a boost for team spirit as
everyone on the team saw
playing time. It also surely
helped erase memories of the
Anderson Junior College game
five days earlier.

In dropping their game to
Anderson 41-13, the Lady
Cats could not feel totally
embarressed. ‘‘They were nat-
ional junior college champions
last year. They play very good
basketball, and they have
eight scholarships to recruit
players with,’’ said Schmader.

Davidson looked like it was
going to be able to stay with
Anderson in the first half as
tfe halftime score was only
22-29. TLhe Lady Cats went
cold from the floor during the
second half and alowed Ander-
son to gain control of the
tempo.

Within eight minutes into
the second half, Anderson, led
by Donna Forrester and Kat-
rina Anderson, pulled out to
wide lead to put the game out
of Davidson’s reach.

Beth Tanner and Donna
Sherrill led scoring with 14
points each while Sherrill also
pulled in eight rebounds.

The Lady Cats’ record now
stands at four wins and eight

‘ losses. Upcoming games in-

clude a Thursday night home
contest with Pfieffer and N.C.
State on February 11.

losing a truly outstanding
