Students to
join Trustees
committees

By Jay JENNINGS
Staff writer

The trustees passed a resolu-
tion last week to allow student rep-
resentation on five of the seven
trustee committees. SGA Presi-
dent Bill Gullan says that he is
“looking forward to working with
the trustees” on campus issues.

Gullan says, “All the credit for
this action goes to Eric Rosenbach,
and we are all in an enormous debt
of gratitude to him” for his efforts.

Rosenbach says, “I think this
is a big step toward a good student-
trustee relationship,” and hopes “‘it
will improve communication.”

Davidson College President
John Kuykendall says, “I think it

will serve the purpose of providing
good input from the students to the
trustees and will put the trustees in
regular contact with the students.”
The five committees on which
students will serve are Buildings
and Grounds, Campus and Reli-
gious Life, Athletics Policy, Insti-
tutional Advancement, and Admis-
sions and Financial Aid. The SGA
President will be on the Campus
and Religious Committee, and the
SGA Vice President will be on the
Athletics Policy Committee.
Students will not be on two
committees: Academics and Edu-
cational Policy and the Finance
and Budget. The reason for stu-

Rosenbach

By Russ TARVER
Associate Editor

Former SGA President and
Senior Eric Rosenbach is the first
from Davidson’s 1995 applicant
pool to be awarded a Fulbright
scholarship.

The presitigious scholarship,
named for the late Arkansas Sena-
tor J. William Fulbright, who op-
posed the Vietnam war and once
chaired the Senate Foreign Rela-

6 g
tions Committee, funds talented
students seeking to bridge the gap
between the United States and other
countries.

Applicants formulate a pro-
posal to study a certain aspect of a
selected country. Interested in the
leadership of countries undergo-
ing political and economic transi-
tion, Rosenbach focused his win-
ning proposal on Bulgaria.

Newcomb awarded Watson Fellowship

Scholar will study Sufism in India, Egypt, Senegal, and Morocco

By Mary Laura Moretz
Staff writer

Named last week as
Davidson’s only winner of the
Watson Foundation Fellowship,
Senior Rachel Newcomb will go
on from India to study in Egypt,
Senegal, and Morocco.

Newcomb’s year-long study
will be funded by the $16,000
awarded with the fellowship. She
plans to explore Sufism, which she
describes as “a path to God which
combines the teachings of Islam
with the individual teachings of a
Sufi master.”

Sufism bears some similari-
ties to parts of Christian monasti-

cism and Buddism. The ‘unique
forms of Sufism in different coun-
tries can “exercise tremendous in-
fluence on the government, as in
Senegal, or they can be largely a
folk religion.”

Fascinated by the wide range
of Sufi practices, Newcomb lists
among them “going into trances,
ecstatic dancing, even slashing the
body.” Different brotherhoods
vary in their orthodoxy — “some
Sufis drink large quantities of cof-
fee to stay awake for long periods
of time,” Newcomb says.

The path to becoming one of °

about 70 national Watson Fellow-
ship winners began for Newcomb
at Davidson, where she submitted

a proposal for her project and then
interviewed with a faculty and staff
committee. Davidson then nomi-
nated her to the national Watson
Foundation. She later faced an
intensive interview with the
Watson Foundation director.

- Member of Davidson’s
Watson committee Dr. Louis
Ortmayer says he felt confident
with all of the Davidson nominees
as he has in the past. He says, “We
have historically done very well”
in the competition. “I’m very
happy for Rachel; her proposal
was very, very good.”

Newcob eagerly anticipates
the adventure which awaits her.
“T’m ecstatic,” she says.
