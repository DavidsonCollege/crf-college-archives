The Davidson Rugby Club
closed its spring season this
past Saturday with one of the
best efforts of the year as they
swept past Wofford College
14-7.

Intermittent rain and a
turfless, rocky field seemed to
promise sloppy play, yet the
Davidson ruggers overcame
these adverse conditions with
excellent play.

Wofford jumped off to an
early lead as they made good
on a 25-yard penalty kick, and
it looked like a long afternoon
for the Cats as the Terriers
swept up and down the field
seemingly at will with good
backfield play and some long,
well-placed kicks.

But the Davidson defertise,
led by the bone-jarring tackles

fullback, somehow always
managed to return Wofford’s

deep kicks before getting

killed. :

Soon the momentum turned
to the ‘Cats favor, as they
penetrated deep into Wofford

territory. But a seemingly

sure try by Pete Johnson was
disallowed by the ref in a
controversial call. The half
ended with Wofford still
leading 3-0.

But Davidson was not to be
denied in the second half, as a
series of deep kicks and some
snappy passing put them back
in Wofford territory. .

Then Mike Merworth (who,
incidentally, displayed true
macho as he played most of
ligaments) alertly pounced on
a loose ball in Wofford’s end
zone, making the score 4-3.

Wofford came roaring back,

on a beautiful broken-field run
by their outside center. Their
conversion kick failed, making

it 7-4.

From then on, it was all
Davidson as Chip Crawford
eluded the Wofford backs for.a
picture-perfect. 50-yard try.

Not 30 seconds later the
‘Cats were knocking on
Wofford’s door again, and
Pete Johnson, not to be denied
this time, bulled his way over
for another four points.

John Lovett, having
previously been frustrated due
to poor kicking angles, finally
split the uprights with a
conversion kick and thus put
the game out of reach, 14-7

With 2 minutes remaining,
Davidson maintained a
defensive strategy, never
threatening again yet keeping
the ball out of trouble with
deep kicks and sure-fire gang
tackling.

Due credit must be given to
the Davidson forwards, as
they displayed excellent
pursuit defensively, and
moved the ball well as a iit.

THE BLOOD SCANDAL |

These days a blood transfusion that’s given to save a life can cause $

a death.

Because. Though there are many reputable commercial blood banks,
blood from commercial sources is, unhappily, ten times more likely to
be the cause of hepatitis than is blood from the American Red Cross
and other community blood banks that depena on volunteer blood—

donors.

Shocking? Of course. :
So, you ask, why doesn’t all blood in American hospitals come from

volunteer donors?
Answer:

A mere three percent of all Americans are donating one hundred }
percent of all the blood that’s freely given in America. It’s not enough. 3
SO, you see, if you’re healthy, fit our easy criteria for donors, and

yet don’t give blood regularly- well, you’re part of the blood scandal in

America.
By default.

One more thing: if you think the Red Cross “gets money” for the
blood you donate, you’re wrong. The only charge that’s ever made is §
to help meet the cost of processing the blood.

SO Call the Red Cross- then roll up your sleeves. Please.

To keep people you know alive and well.

People like you, helping people like you. als

Your opportunity is coming soon!

The set scrums were
dominated by the ’Cats, as
consistently good surges made
the hooker’s job easy.

Davidson's seniors, playing
in their last game, went out in

Crawford’s try was without a
doubt the prettiest of the
season.

However, loss of these
seniors leaves many gaps to be
filled on next year’s team. So
if you have a latent masochis-

you in the fall.

host SC Tourney

Davidson is hosting the
Southern Conference Tennis
Tournament for the eighth
time in 24 years.

The Wildcats (16-11) have
won six of the eight they have
hosted, but this year they
rank as the darkhorse.

Furman (17-12) and Appa-

lachian (20-6) are the favorite:

in the tournament, which be-
gan today and will run
through Saturday.

* Other teams competing are
The Citadel, East Carolina,
William and Mary, VMI, and
newcomers Western Carolina
and Marshall.

Singles play was scheduled
to begin Thursday and Friday
mornings at 8:30 and Satur-

day at 9:30. Doubles were
scheduled for 2:00 pm each
day.

Davidson coach Jeff Frank
commented, ‘‘We play much
better on clay than we do on
hard courts. We lost to both
Furman and Appalachian in
the regular season, but that
was on hard courts. I think we
have as good a chance as
anyone to win it. = =

‘For us to win the cham-
pionship this year would re-
quire three things: 1) for the
match to be on clay, 2) for
each of the entries to play up
to his capability, and 3) a large
and vocal group of fans to be
out at all these matches to
make the homecourt advan-
tage really a homecourt ad-
vantage,” said Frank.
