The battle will be soon a row an!
Nat at Beatie, but at Cowan!

A shot rings out;.a bullet olunks;
"They got Brave William! The dirty skunks?"

The British soldiers now are whooping;
Down on the rebels, they are swooping;
The Captains to the men are shouting; .
And into Davidson's men comes doubting?
A rebel voice — "Let's quit this fight;
We'll all fetch Greene!" - - Exit right.

So ends the tale of battle gory =

Of William D's one claim to. glory.

A tear from every eye now drips -

Brave William D cashed in his chips!

4nd please, I pray, don't curse the ones
Who ran - - for still, they saved his guns!
