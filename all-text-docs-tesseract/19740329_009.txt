Davidson’s Beer Gut

By HAL HUNTLEY
Staff Writer

On a cold, rainy Nov. 29, 1965 evening,
about 11:30 p.m., two Davidson juniors
were apprehended by Campus Security
Officer ‘‘Cop’’ Linker in a secluded cor-
ner of the soccer field. They were
charged with the possession of three six-
packs of Schlitz. The two students were
permanently suspended from school.

The days of clandestine beer parties
at Davidson are gone. The midnight
bands of bootleggers smuggling six-
packs onto the campus to eagerly
waiting customers have long since
disappeared.

Since 1968, when the Board of
Trustees voted to allow alcoholic
beverages on campus, students have no
longer been forced to go to Hatties or the
Broken Anchor to talk to other students

over a beer.

Despite the availability of beer to
Students, about one quarter of the
Student body does not drink beer, ac-
Cording to the results of a poll taken of
300 Davidson College students.

The major reason these students gave
for not drinking beer was “I don’t like it.
It doesn’t taste good to me.”

One student indicated that he didn’t
drink beer because “I don’t take
anything that limits the control which I
have over my body.” ;
__‘I’m afraid that if I started drinking

beer, I’d like the taste so much that 1
might become an alcoholic.’’ another
student responded.

“I’ve found something better,’’
several replied.

Other students admitted that they like
to drink enough beer at one sitting to get
a little high or completely drunk.

“It sure beats dope,”’ said one junior.
‘The next time you see a freak, ask him
if he lights up a hot joint after he has
been working in 95 degree weather.”’

From the results of the poll, it is obvi-
ous that Davidson ladies drink far
less beer than do their gentlemen coun-
terparts. A few did admit enjoying get-
ting ‘‘pleasantly plowed once in a
while,’’ as one coed put it.

The poll shows that whereas more
juniors and seniors drink beer than do
freshmen and sophmores, more fresh-

Students polled indicated that the
most popular brand on the Davidson
campus is Schlitz. a close
second is Budweiser. Michelob, Pabst
Blue Ribbon, and Old Milwaukee follow
respectively in the popularity :

ported such as Lowenbrau and
Heiniken are popular but are seldom
purchased due to their unavailability
and expense.

Back in the days when the College
Union gave away beer in the Rat’s
Cellar, Schlitz and Old Milwaukee were
the two brands most frequently served.

polling a close second.

Another poll showed that students
considered Phi Delta Theta as the
leading beer drinking social club. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Phi Gam-
ma Delta, and Sigma Phi Epsilon
respectively were considered close con-
tenders.

Honors for the most beer drunk at a
single occasion goes to Phi Delta Theta
during a recent head-ball game. Par-
ticipants and spectators managed to
empty five kegs during the festivities.

Another famous beer tradition at
Davidson is the Phi Delta Theta ‘‘shot-a-
minute contest.” Participants must be
able to drink (and hold down) one ounce
of beer every minute, with the Delt who
last joins the ranks under the tables
declared the winner. The current record
is held by Bill McIlwain who walked
away from the table after 181 shots of
beer in three hours and one minute.

However, most students don’t seem to
indulge often in such excesses.

“I just enjoy a beer on weekends,”
one student said. ‘‘I like to spend some
time relaxing on Friday nights, and of-
ten that relaxation includes a beer.’’
