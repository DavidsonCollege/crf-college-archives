The Davidsonian

* May 5.1978

“Mac Cormac plans tenure commie.

(Continued from page 1)
mendations,’ MacCormac’s
proposal continues, ‘the Presi-

_dent shall submit the written
‘recommendation of the Com-
mittee along with his own
recommendation to the Trus-

;-tees.’’

The Proposal concludes,
“This Committee also shall hear
appeals from those faculty who
have not been granted tenure.”

MacCormac emphasized that
his proposal would be a fulfill-
ment of the College Constitu-
tion, not an amendment.

MacCormac proposed a Te-
nure Committee in 1973, but the
faculty did not enact it. What
does he think the chances of the
passage of this proposal? ‘‘I
don’t know what will happen. I
don’t want to be a prophet of
doom or a prophet of joy.

“TI think that tenure is a
greater issue now than it was
then, because of the problems of
the job market, and we have
lots of young people here.

“‘And we have a splendid
faculty here—very, very good
people here, young people and
older people, too. In my judg-
ment, this is the best faculty
Davidson College has ever had.

“So you want to have the
fairest possible system,’ Mac-
Cormac continued.

“My primary reason for pro-

posing it is the same as it was
five years ago: I believe that
faculty members have a respon-
sibility to protect their acade-
mic freedom by investing them-
selves in the process of selecting
people for tenure and not leav-
ing it to administrators.

' “The public at large, regents,
some trustees here and every-
where criticize as for using
tenure as job security, and I
thing it is in our own self-inter-
est to protect tenure so that we
can speak the truth as we see
it—and we may not always
possess the truth, but there is
no one capital truth—but so
that we can speak freely and
teach freely when we maintain
this protection for that right
and not just to hide behind it for
job security. And the way to do
that is to become involved in
the process.

“And it will be painful for a
faculty to tell other faculty that
they can’t stay here and have a
job, but they ought to be able to
assume that responsibility.

“They have a further respon-
sibility, and that is to maintain
competence of the whole facul-
ty, tenured and non-tenured.
This can be done positively by
encouragemnt, not by threaten-
ing people. So I think this
ought to be a normal thing.”

The Professional Affairs
Committee (PAC) held a meet-

ing of the faculty Tuesday to
continue discussion of the Code
of Evaluation. After completing
the Code deliberation, the sub-
ject of a faculty evaluation
committee was discussed, al-
though MacCormac’s proposal

was not specifically dealt with.

According to Professor of
History David Shi, some of the
faculty at the meeting were
concerned “that a faculty com-
mittee would tend to be too
subjective in its evaluation and
not be really rigorous. It would
want to give tenure’to everyone,
he said

Professor History David Rice
commented, ‘‘I believe very
strongly that fagulty tenure is
fundamentally faculty business.
I don’t care what, the prticualr
constitution of this college is.’’

Rice added, ‘‘I think in
general you'll find across the
country that faculty have much
more input into this decision-
making process than they do
here.”’

Rice says he supports Mac-
Cormac’s proposal ‘‘whole-
heartedly. It seems to me the
obvious solution.

“It’s time Davidson College
recognized that it has for a long.
time been living in a fool’s
paradise. It’s not the case
across the board in the country
that everyone who comes here
can pretty much presume that if

everything goes well, he or she
will get tenure. It doesn’t work
well in practice.

“The faculty is getting much .
more heavily tenured.

‘‘The time will come when
decisions are going to have to
be made by a committee of
peers rather than two adminis-
trators whose purpose is to
administer. Their attitude to-
ward the running of this college
may be in some very fundamen-
‘tal ways than those of the
faculty.

“The faculty have to live with’
other faculty; administrators
come and go.”

Rice also stated that his
experience with a faculty com-
mittee has shown him that
“faculty are harder than admi-
nistrators on these things. A-
gain, from the perspective that
decisions they make usually
involve a lifetime commitment.
It’s people thye have to live
with for the next thirty years or
so that they have to choose.

“I’ve never heard of that
argument before, and I find it
absurd on the surface. There’s
no reason why the faculty
should be more lenient than the
administraation or that stu-
dents should be more lenient. I
just think that’s a false argu-
ment; it’s irrelevant to the
whole situation.”

The real question, according
to Rice is whether faculty are
willing to accept the responsibi-
lity of evaluating other faculty.
“IT think the vast majority, of
the older faculty at least, are
prepared to abdicate the re-
sponsibility and leave it to the
administration. I regret this
very deeply.”

Another aspect of the debate
over the tenure committe
should be whether students

should serve on the committee.
Some opponents argue that
students may judge a professor
harshly or unfairly because of a
poor grade in his course or other
such reasons.

Also, confidentiality, some
argue, should be kept as tight
as possible.

MacCormac recognizes ‘‘cer-
tain limitations” students may

have in evaluating faculty, but .

he stated, ‘‘On the issue of
confidentiality, I think students
would treat it very carefully,
very responsibly, and not leak
out personnel information.

‘‘My experience with the
Honors Center the three years I
was dean was to have students
sit on evaluation committees for
other students.”

MacCormac said, “‘They were
extremely responsible, they
were harsher on other students
in terms of maintaining high
standards than the faculty ge-
nerally were, and they were
quite open. in telling other
students after the meeting of
their own will why they voted
against them—not revealing
how we, the faculty, voted, but
they would go up to a student
and say, ‘Look, I don’t think
you‘re ready for entrance.’

“Five years ago, | wasn’t
willing to recommend students
for such a committee. After my
experience in the Honors Cen-
ter, which is limited and may
not be universal, I have tc
speak out on my experience at
Davidson College, I would re-
commend having students.

“IT think the role of the
student is to ensure that there
be some fair way of taking a
random sampling and a careful
evaluation of faculty members
in terms of their effectiveness of
teaching.”
