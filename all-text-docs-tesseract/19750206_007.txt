He argued that the best way
to help the Lazy-B defendants
was through the system, by
correctly using the legal
processes that had perhaps
been used improperly initially.
And Vernon had been proved
correct.

Since being at Central Prison,
Vernon has continued to fight
for his fellow inmates and for
reforms, helping to organize the
North Carolina Prisoners’
Labor Union. Vernon’s own
case is now on trial, and much
of his future will be decided by

its outcome.

If he wins, his opportunities to
work towards his goals of im-
provement will be much
greater; if he does not win, the
struggle begins again. Either
way, Vernon has a chance to
contribute, to make it.

Staff Writer :
The organ music of Jehan
Alain (1911-1940) has a univer-
sal appeal lacking in much con-
temporary music, particularly

in music written for the organ.
A selection of his works is
featured in a Musical Heritage’
Society release (MH5-868; 1991
Broadway; N. Y., N. Y. 10023)
recorded for Erato in France by
his younger sister Marie-Claire.
While a student of such great
musicians as Paul Dukas,
Roger Ducasse and Marcel
Dupre he was at the same time
associated with the ‘Young

At Ovens Auditorium in

phony Orchestra, on the 12th at

certo’ as the major work, as
well as ‘“Ehe Herbides Over-

pieces by Saint-Saens and
Moussorgsky-Ravel. Call 372-

shows an influence that
manifests itself in Messiaen’s
music, but while he uses
unresolved dissonances
frequently the sound of his har-

akin to the ‘‘traditional’’ har-

generation--composers _like
Debussy, Ravel and Ducasse.

registrational changes. A static
piece, the sound just hangs in
mid-air.

The ‘Second Fantasy” con-
sists of two themes treated over
and over in'turn as the intensity
of the sound increases and the
accompaniments become more
complex. After the climax it
ends with a gentle variation on
the first theme.

The entire second side of the
recording is taken up by the
“Three Dances: Joy, Grief, and
Struggles”, the third being his
last work.

Of all the music he wrote, this
suite, best sums up his musical -
ideas: he was actually scoring
it for full orchestra when the
war took his life.

All the elements of his style
are here: powerful rhythms,
colorful harmonies, fine
musical ideas and form, all
combining together to make a
fascinating and moving piece of
music.

The last movement has
significance in the development
of his style: the .unresolved
dissonance not only says
something about the subject of
the dance but might be taken to
imply that he has resolved a
stylistic struggle and was
moving into even bolder use of
dissonance. This is really his
masterpiece.

The performance of these

‘ works is musical, tasteful, full

of energy and sympathy to the
composer’s intent. Nothing less
can be expected from Marie-
Claire Alain and any criticisms
are really a discussion of
relative degrees of excellence.

My only complaint is her tem-
po: She always tends to-play a
bit fast but the result is always
very>musical. It may be that
this was her brother’s style as:
well, and this seems to be im-
plied in her comments, and
writings about her brother.
