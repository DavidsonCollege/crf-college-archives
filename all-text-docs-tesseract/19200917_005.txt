Have You Noticed It {
The campus is so fresh and green
you'd think it was spring.

Our Motto:
Freshmen should be raised right
—the ceiling’s the limit.

Who teaches Schedule? We need
a course in that.

Ain’t those Chambers radiators
fine?

Steam heat in Chambers 2 Sure,
you get up steam carrying in coal.

Hang Out the Crepe.
Our girl has kicked us.

Who'd ’o Thunk It?

We see an ad that says “Put iron
soles on children’s shoes and reduce
the H.C. L.” That’s what we call,
“horsing” the children. i

Extra.

The Hammett-Fricker fracas of
last evening reads like the Demsey-
Miske bout. . .

Hammett starts by landing Frick-
er one on left jaw. Fricker swings
six to left head. Fricker places
three fast ones on stomach and one
on. jaw. Hammett staggers. Frick-
er lands twelve on head, alternating
right and left. Fricker bangs out
two upper-cuts and six on ribs.
Fricker lands fast one on nose an
Hammett falls. Hammett takes
count of five. Hammett staggers to
feet and is knocked down by hot
one right eye. Victorious Fricker
lifts the vanquished warrior to his
feet after the count of ten. Frick-
er’s dream busts.

Many a man who styles himself a
diplomat is called a plain liar by

ers.

Call the Ambulance.
Newspaper headlines “Republican
candidate spends busy Sunday—at-
tends Church.” According to this he
would work himself to death if he
had to attend Davidson for a week. |

You Tell ’Em.
“Dearest why do you talk so
much? Most folks \who talk as
much as you do get paid for it.”

He— “May I call?” ;

She—“Yes, if you won't do it too:
loud.” e

Help!

Altho most folks think “fool” and
“crazy” are synonymous. There’s
a lot of difference between “being
crazy about a girl” and “having a
girl make a fool out of you.”

Plug ‘Em Up. ;

If humming sounded to the per-

son producing the disturbance like

it does to those who listen we be-

lieve there would be a lot less hum-
ming.

It's a poor elevator that won't
work both ways. We figger that
with the income tax in force the
government owes us something.

Next week we will have a story
entitled, “A Lost Opportunity” or
“She Turned Me Down,” by Wil-
liam Minter, of the fresh class.

Heard at the Cornelius-Hoskins
me: “Give him a runner, he looks
ike he’s going to hit.”

Is That It?

J. P. Price hands out the informa-
tion that Rumple now has_ three
stories—Joe, Sam and their kid
brother,

He's A Bird. ©
We have all seen the freshmen
whom the local paper said was
“handsome, attractive and brilliant”
but we didn’t recognize him at first.

Voice down stairs—“What tinte
is it?”

Voice up stairs—“The clock’s run
down.”

V. D. S—“‘Not down here.”

The Salisbury Post carries the
news about a boy who “was injured
in an imaginary automobile ac-
cident.” That’s what we call let-
ting your imagination run away
with you.

The Way We Do, or Rules For Soci-
al Conduct.

By W. M. and C. B.

1. When calling on ladies carry
an automobile.

2. In speaking, if she does not
offer her hand, take it.

3. Remove all crushable articles
from coat pockets.

4. If there is but one chair the
gentleman must take his seat first.

5. Avoid loud vissing and smash
all street lights in vicinity.

6. Never rise to go and sit down
again—stay down. .

7. Be brave—faint heart never
got good hug.

8. Should she refuse to faint you
can trip her up—that answers the
same purpose.

9. Talk on subjects interesting to
the young lady—(There is but one.)

10. When leaving do not part
abruptly, but with a short ceremony.

Notice!

The Peanut Parcher wants the
original wit and near-wit of the
students. Write out your contribu-
tion, sign your name, and drop in
box provided for their reception in
No. 11 Chambers. Credit will be

Thanx.

THE WINNING WAY.

If you put a little lovin’ into all the work
you do

And a little bit of gladness and a little
bit of you,

And a little bit of sweetness and a little
bit of song,

Not a day will seem too toilsome, not a
day will seem too long,

And your work will be attractive and
the world will stop to look,

And the world will see a sweetness like
the tinklin’ of a brook

In the finished job. And then the world
will turn to look at you

With a world’s appreciation of the
things you've found to do.

Just a little bit of lovin’ and a little bit
of song,

And some pride to sort of make it
straight, and true and clean and
strong;

And the work that you're a-doin’, pretty
near before you know,

Will have set the world a-talkin’.
the little winds that blow

Will bring echoes of it to you, and you'll
see that you have done

More than you had dreamed or hoped
for when the task was first begun;

And you'll find the bit of lovin’ you have
put into the same

Has come back to you in lovin’ and
come back to you in fame.

And

Them that strive for fame shall miss it—
and that’s what they ought to do;

But if you put some gladness and if you
put some of you

In the task that is before you and you
put a bit of pride

Into it and you go at it glad of heart
and ager-eyed,

You will find the world is turnin’ pretty
soon to look your way

And you'll find that there's a sweetness
in the task of every day.

And the world will see your work and
pretty soon will speak your name

And you'll find you have found lovin’
and you'll find you have found
fame. —Houston Post.

FAMILY NAMES.

“A great many family names represent
the trades or occupations of our great-
great-great grandfathers. John, the mill-
er, and after that his descendants were
known as Miller,” says Clifford Howard
in an article on the meaning of ngmes
in the September number of Boys’ Life.
“And Robert, the baker, started the fam-
ily name of Baker. And thus we have
many other familiar names—Carpenter,
Mason, Taylor, Shoemaker, Brewer,
Draper, Shepherd, Fisher, Hunter, Clark
(clerk), Page, Harper, Singer and a
whole lot more. But chief among them
all is Smith. The reason there are so
many Smiths today is because there used
to be so many different kinds of smiths
—blacksmiths, goldsmiths, silversmiths,
coppersmiths, tinsmiths, locksmiths, ar-
rowsmiths, and so on. Each, for short,
was known simply as a smith; and each
different kind of smith started his own
family of Smith.

In many cases if there was something
very striking about a man—if he was
very short or had red hair or had some
peculiar trait or habit—it was used for
