SIDELINES

HOMECOMING was a good weekend for sports from
the spectator’s viewpoint, particularly if the spectator
were pulling for the wrong team. The Wildcats engaged
in without a doubt the two most suspenseful afternoons
of the fall sports season, but with traditional Homecom- |
ing luck, lost a soccer match and a football game.

IT’S HARD to use the word “lost” when you. talk
about that soccer game with Carolina, one of the na-
tion’s most highly regarded teams and a contender for
the N.C.A.A. championship.

BUT THE SCORE was one to nothing and the
‘Cats were on the short end. The score didn’t show
15 amateurs, in the strictest sense of the word, play
their hearts. out against a two-platooning team of re-
cruited specialists. It didn’t show the anguish on the
Tarheel coach's face of the desperation in his team’s
play as they fought off their first defeat in 12 games
and watched a national ranking nearly wats down
the drain.

THE SOCCER FIELD was a great wide hog slop
of mud and players often had to plough through ankle-
deep puddles to root out the ball. The Tarheels may not
have been used to roughing it — the mire may have
slowed them down — but the truth is, they were out-;
hustled and out-played. You can’t take anything away |

WOFFORD HAD SCORED and the cheerleaders,
after a feeble attempt to liven things up with « mule
and female companionship, had settled back into their
normal state of general inadequacy.

THEN, BENSON, who hadn’t done any rough work
in three weeks, suddenly was behind the center, and
Davidson could have scored on any team on the sched-
ule.

DAVE WARDEN, bad ankle and all, ran harder and
farther than he has all year. The Wofford line, which |
isn’t very good anyway, suddenly was as holy as Swiss,
cheese and Warden reeled off three first downs in a row.

THE CHANGE which spread over the Homecom- |
ing crowd when Benson first took over was as notice-
able as the change in the team. Several versions of |
pulchritude even asked who this Benson boy was,
