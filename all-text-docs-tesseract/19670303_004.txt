The Davidsonian

Proposed Faculty Constitutional Draft Analyzed

ED. NOTE: This is the first
of @ series of four articles by
Mike.. Gates, who .has . been
studying the proposed facully
constitution with Dr. Alan B.
Brinkley, chairman of the fac-
ulty committee which drafted
the document. In the next
articles, Bates will examine
specific parts of the draft.

By MIKE BATES
Editorial Correspondent

The proposed draft for a new
faculty constitution may well
have more effect on David-
son’s future than the Blue Sky
Committee, the Ford Grant or
any other event in recent Da-
vidson history.

Largely this draft is an ex-
pression of present practice.
However, when the Faculty
Constitution Committee made
custom explicit, it had to de-
cide what present practice ac-
tually is.

That is, it had to define the
present situation, which is cer-
tainly the first step necessary
for institutional progress.

The proposed draft goes be-

yond a simple formalization of
current assumption and prac-
tice. It also changes the organ-
tion of the faculty to provide
ization of the faculty to pro-
vide for greater flexibility and
strength. The changes are evi-
dent in the new committee
structure, which would replace
the present disorder and infor.
mality.

The present committee struc-

ture is exactly what one would
expect to result from 100 years
of functioning without a consti-
tution. There are now 30 stand-
ing committees, none of which
have certain knowledge of
their responsibilities and juris-
diction.
. Present standing committees
range from the Executive
Committee and other elective
committees to an assortment
of appointive committees, such
as the Engineering Commit-
mittee, the Algernon Sydney
Sullivan Committee and the
powerful committee on the lan-
guage lab.

Current practice makes
many of these committees

practically autonomous. Unless
a faculty member wants open-
ly to ask in a faculty meeting
that a certain committee re-
port its activities. these com-
mittees need never tell the full
faculty what they are doing.

The new draft would re-
quire as a routine procedure
an annual report from each
committee. Such a_ report
would describe the commit-
tee's activities over the past
year and the policy assump.
tions under which it operates.

This. simple change would
make reevaluation of policy an
easy possibility. It would thus
structure flexibility and possi-
bility for change right into the
constitution. The permanent
Blue Sky Committee provided
for in the new draft also does
this, as do the new responsi-
bilities for the Executive Com-
mittee.

In contrast, present practice
often requires that policy eval-
uation take place outside the
permanent structure. The re-
cent establishment of the Blue
Sky Committee shows this.

In other words, the present
system is structured for reac-
tion rather than real policy-
making. The proposed struc-
ture multiplies possibilities but
certainly does not decide pol-
icy. The men who fill the posi-
tions of responsibility would
continue to do that.

The Fac ult y Constitution
Committee considered the pos-
sibility of representative fac-
ulty government, such as es-
tablishing a faculty senate.
However, their draft would
continue the present partici-
pational system. It would
strengthen this system by plac-
ing a limit of three consecutive
years of service on members
of an elective committee.

No faculty member, other
than the president or one of the
deans, would be allowed to
serve simultaneously on more
than one of the following com-
mittees: the Executive Com-
mittee. the Committee on Edu-
cational Policy and the Com-
mittee on Student Life. In ef-
fect these limits would pro-
mote greater participation and

FATHER CONROY ASKS

Does The Ministry

Require Celibacy?

By MARVIN ELLISON
Stat Writer

Father Donald Conroy, a Rom-
an Catholic priest, argued in
chapel Tuesday that celibacy: is
soon “to come to the surface as
the no. 1 issue of the Catholic
Church.”

Conroy. chaplain of students
at the University of Minnesota,
said, ‘‘Celibacy raises the ques-
tion of the personal freedom of
a man called to the ministry. It
is man searching for self-deter-
mination.”

Interested in contemporary re-
ligion and a participant in the
civil rights march at Selma.
Ala.. Father Conroy had begun
his talk with comments about
Catholicism and its involvement
with current issues and prob-
lems, both within and outside of
the church.

He told of a meeting held last
year for the discussion of United
States policy in Vietnam. Roman
Catholic bishops on this conti-
nent were invited to attend, but
only one bishop sent a repre-

Debate Team Competes

in National Tournament

The Davidson Debnters flew to
Philadelphia this morning for
their last tournament of the
year.

Tom Rhodes and Greg Haynes
are representing Davidson at the
fifth annual Liberty Bell Tour-
nament at the University of
Pennsylvania.

“This will be the most chal-
lenging tournament we've ever
been to. both in competition and
scheduling.’’ Rhodes stated.

Top teams from all over the
nation. especially the New York
area, are competing for nation-
al ranking in eight rounds.

This is the first time this year
that Davidson will have five de-
bates in one day. “It’s a real
challenge to think straight after
nine hours of debate,” Haynes
pointed out.

Also this weekend. the David-
son Novice Debaters travel to
Lenoir-Rhyne for their Novice
Tournament. Competition in this
tournament is limited to debat-
ers in their first year of varsity

competition. Debate coach Ray
MeMillin will accompany this
group and act as an official
judge.

Plans for Davidson's affirma-
tive case this weekend are se-
cret, but the national topic is—

sentative.

Conroy quoted Robert McAfee
Brown's reaction to this appar-
ent apathy on the part of the
bishops to the war.

Brown had said, ‘What today
is lack of action, tomorrow will
be called an act of open immor-
ality.”

Conroy, who was speaking in
informal and relaxed manner,
then made some comments on a
Catholic issue of more personal
concern to him—the question of
celibacy in the church.

Defining celibacy as legislation
by the Roman Catholic Church
which requires its ministry to
remain unmarried, Father Con-
roy explained his own position:
“I am not talking of virginity,
and this is not an issue of
whether celibacy is a way of
showing authentic expression of
Christian life."

Although celibacy is a law of
the church, he cautioned that the
basis of any legislation must be
human freedom. ‘‘When we have
had a law of church legislation
for a good reason, it does not
mean that legislation exists as a
good law today.

responsibility for more faculty
members.

One possible problem with
the proposed draft from the
students’ point of view is the
rule against disclosing opinions
of individuals or groups ex-
pressed within faculty meet-
fngs (Article Ill, Section 10).
The form found in the propos-
ed draft is a very strong state-
ment, far stronger than the
committee realy intends for
practice.

This particular rule is evi-
dece of a patronizing and pa-
ternalistic attitude toward stu-
dents. That is, the rule would
require not only that the fac-
ulty continue to meet behind
closed doors, which is. undesir-
able enough in student opin:
fon; but also this rule would
prevent students from know-
ing after the meeting what
took place. Presently students
can generally learn the latter.

Dr. Alan B, Brinkley, chair-
man of the Faculty Constitu-
tion Committee, says that the
rule is to prevent misrepre-
sentation of the views express-

: ' Top Catholic Issue

Celibacy.’ Conroy remarked,
“has often been called a ‘pack-
age deal’.”’ He feels as if he has
been called to be a priest, and
then he gets celibacy with it.”

Concluding with several of his
own predictions, Conroy antici-
pates a forma) disassociation of
the clergy and celibacy. “I: ex-
pect to see a married clergy in
about five years,”’ he said.

Challenge Funds
$1.5 Million Short

Davidson lacks about $1.5 mil-
lion in its current Ford Chal-
lenge Program, the goal being
$5.5 million by June 30, 1968, it
was announced Saturday night.

Ford has promised to match
the college's funds with $2.2 mil-
lion in challenge grants.

nounced the program's progress

dents of Mecklenburg County.

ed at a meeting. He calls it
“unprofessional” to disclose
such views.

Actually, however, the real
motive involved if the faculty
adopts this rule is largely the
prevention of effective student
influence on faculty members
concerning issues discussed at
meetings. Stopping the flow of
information is certainly an ef-
fective, but ever so expensive
method of preventing misrep-
resentation ‘of views. Because
of the real nature of the is-
sue, Brinkley has no right to
sugest unprofessionalism.

significant: Advancement and
