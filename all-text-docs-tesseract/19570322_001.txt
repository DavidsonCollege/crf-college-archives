day cvening, in the Ballroom of
the College Union.

that institution having changed
from the quarter to the semester
system.

Balloting For 3 Major
Offices Stays Steady

During the completion of the
balloting for the three major cam-
pus officers, chairman of the elec-
tions board, Tom Morgan released
the second set of figures on this
year’s elections trends.

These major offices are Stu-
dent Body President, Davidsonian
Editor, and YMCA President.

Monday, with all major offices
still in contention, 509 votes were
cast at the College Union polls
for an electorate total of 62%

Tuesday, with the balloting in
Chambers, but with only one of-
fice in question 547 ballots were
turned in, raising the total to
67%.

Morgan again pointed out that
the insignificant difference in the
percentage taking part in the first
two days of election demonstrated
that the actual location of the
polling place has little effect on
the election response.

Willa Cather Award
Postponed To April 5

The presentation of the Willa
Cather Literary Competition win-
ner was postponed from today’s
chapel to that of Friday, April 5.

This move was necessary be-
cause of the conflict raised by the
weeks election activity.

Mr. Charles Lloyd will appear
as the featured speaker, and will
make the annual award as was
previously scheduled.

Dr. Spencer Leaves To Accept
Presidency Of Mary Baldwin

Will Finish Out Semester;
Successor Not Named

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Dean of Students here since
1954, was named President of Mary Baldwin College by the
college Trustees in session in Staunton, Virginia yesterday
afternoon.

Dr. Spencer will continue

at Davidson through the cur-

rent semester and take office at Mary Baldwin in August.
His successor has not been named.

The Spencer announcement fol-,°
lows closely on the heels of Dr.
Cunningham's resignation of a
month ago, thus leaving two ma-
jor vacancies in the College Ad-

Lministration.

Dr. Richard R. Potter, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church of
Staunton, has served as acting
president of Mary Baldwin since
the resignation of the former
President, Dr. McKenzie, in Sep-
tember 1956. Dr. McKenzie had
served for two years.

Governed by a 26-man Board of
Trustees headed by Mr. Edmund
C. Campbell of Washington. D.
C., Mary Baldwin is a Presbyte-
tian College for women, similar

-Jin) many respects to Davidson.

DR. SAMUEL R. SPENCER

Spencer's

Statement

Though I believe the work to which I am going at
Mary Baldwin represents a great need and a real op-
portunity, the decision to leave Davidson has been the
most difficult I ever faced. To say that I leave with re-
gret is not only trite but an absurd understatement.

Davidson is a great many things to us all, but main-
ly it is people. Mrs. Spencer and I will deeply miss friends
on the faculty and staff, in the community, and in the

Student Body.

One of the consolations in leaving is my conviction
that the quality of the Davidson Student Body and of stu-
dent leadership has never been higher than now. This,
together with my confidence in such people as Mr. Smith,

Dr. Staples, Mr. White, Mrs.

Little, Dr. Ostwalt, and Mr.

Bray, makes me feel that student work is stable and pro-

gressive.

We will not move to Staunton until August. After
that, the latchstring is out to any Davidson man—both at
our home and at Mary Baldwin.

Ross Smyth Elected President;
John Trask To Edit Davidsonian

Student Body elections comple
ted last Monday named rising-
senior Ross Smyth as the new
president of the Davidson Student
Body. A member of Sigma Alpha

Epsilon, Smyth is a native of
Charlotte.
Tuesday’s vote affirmed the

choice of John Trask as Editor of
the Davidsonian. From Beaufort,
S. C., the rising senior is a mem-
ber of Kappa Alpha.

The election of Dabney Stuart
as Secretary-Treasurer in Mon-
day’s primary rounded out the
slate of student body officers.

ROSS SMYTH
Student Body President

Stuart joins first Vice-President
Tom Cutting and second Vice-
President John Kuykendall in as-
sisting Smyth with next year’s
Student Council leadership.

The new president has advocated
a thorough study of the Honor
System with the view of establish-
ing a suspension penalty as a
minimum punishment to accom-
pany a maximum dismissal for
code violations.

On the question of compulsory
religion at Davidson, Smyth pro-
poses a change to voluntary at-

tendance at chapel and Vesper
services if a comprehensive exam-
ination shows such a program to
be feasible.

His stand on the new fraternity
court is one of general acceptance,
with efforts toward the building
of single houses if possible. Smyth
wishes to enforce the present Hell
Week and drinking-rule-interpre-
tation policies.

New Editor Trask made the fol-
lowing statement after his recent
election: “First, let me say that

ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM

Seminar Discusses
US-USSR Relations

Davidson College is serving as host for a Residential
Seminar on World Affairs which will continue through Sun-

day.

The seminar, which began yes-
terday, is discussing the topic,
“Evaluation of U.S. and U.S.§.R.
Relations.” This subject will cov-
er three general topics, the polit-
ical, economic, and military com-
petition between the two world
powers.

The three and one-half day
meeting is limited to no more
than twenty-five persons. David-
son faculty members who will par-
ticipate are Professors Harold
Ford, Paul Marrotte, and Russell
Brown.

With the exception of one ses-
sion, all meetings will be closed
to the public. Davidson faculty
and students are invited to attend
the Sunday afternoon meeting in
the ballroom of the Union at 2:00
p.m.

These closed sessions are deemed
necessary because it is felt that
a more free and personal discus-
sion can be held in a smaller

group. and also to prevent the
possibility of any of the partici-
pants being misquoted by outside
observers.
