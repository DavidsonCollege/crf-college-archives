Author ‘Tom Wolfe Addresses Audience On Clerisy

Tom Wolfe addresses a packed crowd In Love Audito

Om Fer apeeny ei de

rium.

By TED WILSON

“I’ve tried to be a heretic,” au-
thor Thomas Wolfe said after his
speech last night on “The Great
Reevaluation: New Ideas and In-
tellectual Fashions in the Twilight
of the 20th Century.” “Someone
had to write and talk about the

.. Clerisy as they write about other
. areas of life . . . Someone should
|. write about the world of writers.”

Wolfe, guthor of several
books, including The Right Stuff
and The Electric Kool Aid Acid
Test, is this year’s Reynold’s Lec-
turer. Sponsored by the Z. Smith
Reynold’s Foundation, the lecture
series began 24 years ago to bring
distinguished guest speakers in
the Humanities, Sciences, Arts
and Philosophy to campus.

Wolfe defined clerisy as the
world of artists, teachers and thin-
kers who have “molded” peoples’
attitudes. He said their role in the
past has been to “mold the con-
sciousness of a nation.” In the
18th and 19th centuries, the
clerisy “mediated between the
upper class and the lower class

and gave direction to the ambi-
“gions of the‘nation?” 9”

But now, there is “a disloca-
tion between objective facts and
attitudes of the clerisy,” and
hence, “the clerisy must meet the
educated public halfway.”

“The clerisy creates the at-
titude that if an American is to be
considered cultivated, he should
appreciate contemporary arts.”
Hence, there is “a huge audience
for difficult arts.” New painters
are reintroducing figures that still
have contorted features, but are
lively and somewhat narrative.

“The role of the painter today
is to take the junk of American
media and to expropriate it,” he
said. The painter must “subvert
the media itself and create a new
form.

Wolfe said today’s dislocation
between the clerisy and the people
they represent “goes back to
America’s version of clerisy.”

He said the clerisy always
seeks “some sort of catastrophic
trend to embrace.” In the 1920s,
they saw the “notion of an Ameri-
can bourgeoisie; the 30s [brought]
the Depression’; FDR’s New
Deal has been labeled “Social Fas-
cisre”; and -Lyndén.B,Johnson’s

social plan has been called “Lib-
eral Fascism.”

Wolfe said the clerisy “em-
braced the War in Vietnam like a
long lost lover by writers [who
described] the war, the enslave-
ment, and the apocalypse.” The
war justified their “role as clerisy,
set upon an apocalyptic §land-
scape.” But now “catastrophes are
lacking in this country,” he said
and the clerisy has nothing to em-
brace.

Wolfe said we are experienc-
ing “a wholesale shift in ideas and
attitudes” as the dawn of the
twenty-first century approaches.

He said such idea changes oc-
curred at the end of both the 18th
and 19th centuries. The French
Revolution in 1789 introduced
new ideas “that changed the his-
tory of the world.” And, one
hundred years ago in the 1800s,
Marxism, Freudianism, and Mod-
ernism emerged, the latter of
which provided the “look” of the
twentieth century and the arts.

He said “You can look at the
map today to see the impact of

Marxism” adding it “affected the

New Head Football Coach Gatto Sets Goals

By. ANDY BARRON

Victor (Vic) Gatto was named
as Davidson’s new head football
coach in an announcement last
Tuesday by Director of Athleti
Christopher (Kit) Morris. ;

“We are delighted to “have
someone with Vic’s outstanding
qualities become part of the
Davidson program,” Morris said.
“As an athlete, a coach and an
educator his career has been

marked by distinction and
achievement.”
“We were especially im-

pressed with his ability to restore
programs, so ably demonstrated at

both Bates College and Tufts Uni-
versity, Vic possesses the charac-
der, ifnagination, leadership and
commitment that we have sought

_in this search from day one.”

Gatto coached Tufts Univer-
sity to an 8-0-0 record in 1979 and
was named Northeastern Coach of
the Year. His overall record at
Tufts was 34-19-3 in seven sea-
sons. In addition, he was an All-
Ivy League halfback on the 1968
Harvard team that went 8-0-1 and
won a share of the conference
championship. He still holds the
Harvard career rushing record
with 2,130 yards.

At Davidson Gatto replaces
Ed Farrell, who will become di-
rector of athletics at the University
of North Carolina at Asheville.
Farrell coached at Davidson for 1 |
years.
At the relatively young age of
38, Gatto will be starting his 13th
season as a collegiate head coach
next fall. Gatto was only 26 years
old when he became head coach at
Bates College in Maine in 1973.

At Bates Gatto won his initial
game to end a 26-game losing
streak at Bates. His 1977 team
was 4-3-1, giving Bates its first
winning season in a decade.

At Tufts he coached four Divi-
sion III first team All-Ameri-
cans—defensive tackle Mark
Buden (1978), quarterback Chris
Connors (1979), tackle Mike
Brown (1980) and nose guard Tim
Keegen (1980).

“I am very excited to be at
Davidson,” Gatto said. Gatto has
several ideas to improve David-
son's playing: “Davidson football
is in a transition period but I think
with an imaginative passing attack
we can be competitive.

“We've got to take a closer
look, but my inclination is to have
a wide-open style of offense that

will enable us to compete with
many opponents. We want a ball
control, passing type of game
similar to that used by many pro
teams.

“One of our primary goals will
be to get student athletes who can
be successful in the classroom and
on the field. Another goal is to
gain support in the immediate
community and from our alumni.”

Gatto received his Masters
Degree in 1971 from Harvard and
has nearly completed require-
ments for his doctorate. He is ana
tive of Natick, Massachusetts, 1s
married and has three children

Admissions Office Focuses On Minority Recruitment

By JOHN GATHINGS

The Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid is planning strate-
gies to meet the goals outlined in
the Task Force on Racial/Ethnic
Concerns’ policy statement.

The statement, which was ap-
proved at the February Trustee
meeting, requires the College ‘to
enroll students and to employ fac-
ulty and staff whose performance
and contribution will be consistent
with Davidson’s traditional stan-
dards of excellence;” also “to in-
tensify efforts to seek trustees,
facutlty, staff and students of vari-
ous racial/ethnic heritages.”

In response to the statement,
the Office of Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid has budgeted addi-
tional money for minority recruit-

ing, scholarships and a full-time
assistant dean of admissions.

Dean of Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid John Griffith said
these changes were necessary.
“This will allow us to be competi-
tive in recruitment and admissions
of minority students,” Griffith
said

In their budget meeting, the
trustees approved an additional
$10,000 in the admissions recruit-
ing budget for minorities. Griffith
emphasized “this should be put
into perspective with the fact that
the total travel budget for last year
was $22,000.” At other schools,
“atypical admissions travel
budget ranges from $50,000 to
$80,000.

The budget also allocates

$40,000 to establish merit schol-
arships for minority students.
Griffith said the Faculty Commit-
tee on Admissions and Financial
Aid, who is responsible for select-
ing merit scholars, will “use the
same criteria as for any student.”

Griffith said these scholar-
ships make Davidson competitive
with other schools. “To compete
for the outstanding black scholar,
we would have to respond to the

recruiting activities of these
schools.”
The Trustees also provided for

a full-time assistant dean of ad-
missions. While the admissions
office is still reviewing applica-
tions for the position, other staff
members are busy with minority
concerns. “We have someone

working just about full time in the
recruitment of black students,”
Griffith said.

Presently, the office plans a
joint’ program with Charlotte
Mecklenburg schools. In a pro-
gram similar to SGA Weekend,
black juniors will visit Davidson,
but only for a day. “The strategies
we are moving toward are aimed
at identifying black students ear-
lier than the fall of senior year,
Griffith said.

The new budget goes into ef-
fect on July 1. Former SGA Presi-
dent John Laughlin said the Trus-
tees had approved a total of
$100,000 to enact the goals of the
Task Force Report. Co-Chairman
of the Task Force Bruce Jackson
said of the Trustees, “I'm pleased

that they were able to find a way to
do it.” He added, “I think this is a
very quick response to us.”

Most of the work now is left
up to the individual departments
affected by the policy. “It is an im-
plementing question now.”
Jackson said.

The Dean of Students Office
has already moved to act on the
policy. Beginning in July, Assis-
tant Dean of Admissions and As-
sistant Dean of Students Paula
Miller will become a full-time as-
sistant dean of students. Miller
said the job will involve a “sup-
port system for all students.” Al-
though there will not be a specific
focus on minority concerns, Mil-
ler said that “minority students
will certainly benefit.”
