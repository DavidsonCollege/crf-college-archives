tion. Gullan says, “I think we need
to consider character ... the ability
to live under the Honor Code.
There are so many things to being
a Davidson student. Our thrust
should: be for well-rounded
people.”

When Gullan expressed this
concern about admissions during
the campaign, many perceived it
as his desire to “dumb-down” the
student body. Gullan says, “That
is not at all what I was saying. We
need to promise them [ applicants]
a challenging academic environ-
ment.” Many freshmen felt par-
ticularly slighted since it seemed

.that Gullan was speaking espe-
cially about them. Gullan says, “I
don’t see a problem, but Isee warn-
ing signs,” such as decreased in-
volvement in extracirriculars.

Gullan’s proposes to increase
student involvement in the admis-
sions and application process.
Also, he wants students to have a
say in the goals of the Admissions
O ffice or at least regular commu-
nication with the office.

Another major goal for
Gullan’s administration is to try to
foster increased unity on campus
between whites and minorities. “It
is important to get everyone at the
table and get everybody talking
and understanding where every-
body is coming from,” he says.

Gullan’s approach to find
unity is to focus on what students
share in common rather than what

separates them. “Diversity and

unity are on the same continuum.
The more we concentrate on dif-
ferences, the harder itis to find
commonality,” he says.

Rather than focusing on group
experience, Gullan wants to em-
phasize individuality: “If we ap-
proach issues from what the blacks
feel, what the women feel, we are
missing out on individual contri-
butions.” Gullan hopes to be a
“facilitator” and not a “combat-
ant” in discussions of race and
division on campus. ‘‘All I can do
is through honest, heart-to-heart,
mind-to-mind communication cre-
ate a climate of openness. Part of
what I hope to gain is some sort of
empathy and sympathy and under-
standing of commonality.”

Gullan’s goal to increase com-
munication has the approval of As-
sistant to Director of Career Ser-
vices Tony Perez. “There are two
ways of approaching [race prob-

lems]. One is the way Billis going’

about it: trying to breakdown walls
and barriers and creating harmony
.. What Bill is doing is fine, it’s
great.”

Associate Professor of His-
tory J. Russell Snapp was recently

invited to join the Historical Soci-

ety of North Carolina.

Snapp will be inducted into
the society at its upcoming April 7
meeting. The society, organized
in 1945, limits its membership to
75 active historians. Members are
traditionally specialists in Ameri-
canhistory with an interest in North
Carolina history.

The society meets twice a
year, with agendas that include
presentations and discussions of
research reports written by mem-
bers or other prominent histori-
ans.

The spring meeting will be
held at the Greensboro Historical
Museum. Normally, the meetings
are held at different campuses
throughout the state.

Snapp is scheduled to be a
speaker at his induction. The

topic for the meeting is “Dynamics
of Politics in the Colonial South.”
Snapp will discuss how the ethnic
backgrounds of certain British of-
ficials influenced the ideas of em-
pire in the colonies.

The topic of his presentation at
the meeting is related to his forth-
coming book, John Stuart and the
Issue of Empire on the Southern
Frontier, to be published in the
next few months by L.S.U Press.

Snapp’s book deals with how
the British policy towards the Na-
tive Americans in the 18th century
angered colonists in Georgia and
the Carolinas, creating tension that
led to the Revolutionary War.

This book is his first, but Snapp
has also written many biographical
sketches of North Carolina colo-
nial leaders for the forthcoming
book, American National Biogra-
phy, to be published by Oxford
University Press. His subjects in-
clude Christopher Gaffenreid, the
founder of New Bern, and gover-
nors Author Dobbs and William

Tryon: In 1991; healso published.
an article on William Henry
Drayton, a Revolutionary leader
in South Carolina, entitled “The
Journal of Southern History.”

Snapp graduated summa cum
laude from the University of the
South and earned his Master’s
degree and Ph.D. from Harvard
University. He was a teaching
fellow at Harvard before joining
the Davidson faculty in 1988.

Davidson faculty who for-
merly held memberships in the
society include C.K. Brown,
Frontis Johnson, Chalmers
Davidson, and David Shi.

Snapp looks forward to join-
ing the society. He says, “It’s an
excellent way to get to know my
colleagues from other institutions
in the state and share ideas with
them. Sharing ideas can be very
stimulating and make one’s re-
search more vital. Also, being
from Arkansas originally, itmakes
me ote more like a North Carolin-

Students ride for Habitat

By CATHERINE ANDERSON
Staff writer

This summer, bikers from
across the nation will ride a 4,000
mile course across the United
States to raise money for Habitat
for Humanity. The tour
stretches from Washington, D.C.
to San Francisco. Each biker will
ride a portion of* ‘the
“Bikecentennial National Trail.”

The Davidson branch of Habi-
tat will participate as part of the 25
core group riders which will ride
the 4,000 miles from coast to coast.

To help Habitat raise money.
for the event, seniors Sarah Cantrell
and Jodi Lewis will head a group
of volunteers doing construction
work in Charlotte in the spring.

Cantrell helped with Habitat
over the Christmas holidays and
feels that “the bicycle challenge
really reflects the spirit of service
that Davidson embodies ... I feel
lucky to be able to have the
oppertunity to strike out on this
adventure on behalf of Habitat for
Humanity.”

Habitat for Humanity is anon-
profit, international organization

dedicated to building homes for
low-income families. In conjunc-
tion with homeowners, Habitat
constructs the homes offering a
no-interest mortgage to the recipi-
ents,

The money raised by the group
will underwrite the construction
costs of one home.

Cantrell and Lewis invite and
welcome all tax-deductable dona-
tions made payable to Habitat Bi-
cycle Challenge. Donors should
send checks to P.O. Box 3086, or
they can contact Cantrell or Lewis
personally.
