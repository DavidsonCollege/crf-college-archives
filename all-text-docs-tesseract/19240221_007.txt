Here and There

Mr. H. A. Query, the popular editor of
“The Gastonia Gazette,” and “Doc” LaFarr,
captain of the 1921 Wildcat football team,
were on the Hill to see one of the recent
basketball games.

Rev. J. C. Rowan and Mr. Archie Can-
non motored over from Concord last week.

Mr. Joe P. Moore is now superintendent
of the public schools at Mebane, N. C. He
is reported to be making a big success of his
work.

Rev. Q. N. Honeycutt, pastor of the Walk-
ersville Church, Waxhaw, N. C., has re-
cently been awarded the degree of Th.D.

Mr. T. Henry Wilson, of Gastonia, was a
campus visitor Friday.

Rev. W. C. McLauchlin, a missionary to
China, who is now on a furlough, was in
Davidson Saturday.

Rev. W. C. McLaughlin and Rev. J. Plum-
mer Smith, a missionary to Africa, who was
here a few weeks ago, both of the class of
07, are very anxious to have a reunion of
their class this spring at commencement, as
this year may be the last time they may have
a furlough together.

Rey. J. W. Goodman, pastor of the An-
tioch Church, Red Springs, N. C., who had

each other. There was a council like this
some years ago, but it was allowed to die.

In the “Y" work, which
came at the same meeting, Davidson com-
pared favorably with the other colleges of
the state. The report showed that we have
practically every activity here that is afford-
ed by any college Y. M. C. A. in the state.

At the last regular meeting of the session
on Friday morning the association voted in
favor of a full-time student state secretary,
to give his time exclusively to college “Y"
work in the state. The matter will rest with
the state committee as to whether or not he
will be employed. ;

Davidson represented on both
days of the conference. Some of those pres-
ent were: Doctor Arbuckle, Doctor Flea-
gle, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Williams, Ted Jones,
J. L. McLean, Harry Price, C. E. Hodgin,
EF. M. Regen, E. K. Regen, A. M. Martin,
A. M. Hillhouse, and M. B. Speir.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS
SEND OUT DEPUTATIONS

Under the direction of Ed. O'Connor, who
heads the Christian Endeavor ° deputation
committee, a deputation will be sent to Fay-
etteville from Friday until Monday. A. H.
Hillingsworth and W. E. “Milton will com-
pose the deputation, which is in response to
an invitation from the Christian Endeavor
Society in that city.

The program at the last Christian En-
deavor Training class meeting took the form
of a formal debate between A. Y. Bowie and
J. A. McInnis, on the question, Resolved,
that the Prayer Meeting Committee is more
important than the Lookout Committee.” No
decision was rendered, but following the de-
bate an open forum was conducted, with
practically every one of the 15 members
present expressing themselves on the issue.

Members of the Christian Endeavor Train-
ing class are looking forward to the return
of their president, Wallace Purdy, who has
been confined in the infirmary for several
weeks, but who will meet with the society
on Sunday,

DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

Plans have been completed for the evange-
listic meetings to be held Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday nights, conducted by Dr. |
Myers, of the First Presbyterian |
Church of Greensboro, Dr, Myers will be
accompanied by Mrs. Myers and a mixed
quartet, composed of two female and. two
male voices. The students can be assured
of some excellent sermons and good iiusie.

The football schedule for next fall is
nearly complete and as announced contains
six games to be played off the Hill and one
on, So far P. C, is the only game scheduled to
be played at Davidson, while Washington and
Lee, University of South Carolina, V. M. T.,
Georgia Tech. A. & E. (now known as N.
C, State), University of North Carolina, are
to be played in their lairs. Games with Wot-
ford, Furman and Wake Forest are pending.

In the Fresh-Soph Deeclamation contest in
the literary societies, A. L. Curry, of the
Philanthropic, and H. White, of the Eu
menean, won the medals.

“Dutch” Hengeveld, star player for the
last three years on Coach Fetzer's baseball
team, has been signed by the Little Rock
(Ark.) club of the Southern Association,
for the summer, From his excellent record
at Davidson we predict that he will make a
big success this summer with the “pill and
stick” It is reported that this is only one of
several big offers made him by big clubs in
the last two years.

The S. A, T. C. has been replaced by the
R. O, T, C, and Dr. Martin has been notified
by government authorities that Licutenant-
Colonel Mueller, of Camp Beauregard, has
been transferred here. While the R. O. T.
C. will not be as bad as the S. A. T. C., rifles
will have to be cleared just as before, but
they will be United States rifles, and perhaps
we will not get “stuck” as often as before.

FRESH-SOPH PRELIMINARIES
SCHEDULED FOR MARCH

The subject for the Fresh-Soph debate this
spring is: Resolved, that the United States
should adopt the Bok Peace Plan. The pre-
liminaries for selecting the society teams will
be held the first week of March. The pre-
liminary debate in the Pandeinic and the
Metrophilian Societies will be held March
8th. The preliminary debate in the Eu-
menian and Philanthropic Socicties will be
held March 6th. These are only for the
purpose of selecting society teams, The in-
ter-society semi-finals will come off the fol-
lowing week; between the Pandeinic and the
Metrophilian, on March 11th; between the
Eumenean and the Philanthropic, on March
13th. The finals between the two winning
societies will be held on March 21st. It is
hoped that a great deal of enthusiasm will
be shown by the societies.

SOPHS TO HOLD ANNUAL
BANQUET IN NEAR FUTURE

At a meeting of the Soph class last Sat-
urday night after the show the question of
a Soph banquet was discussed. The idea
received the hearty support of all the class
and from all indications the Sophs are going
to pull a big ‘un some time in the near
future.

A committee, consisting of Hudson, Shaw,
Minter, Bouvier and Regen, is now working

All that the committe can report now is that |
the banquet will be held in Charlotte, at one
of the hotels or at the Chamber of Com-
merce.

The exact date has not yet been decided
on but will probably be within the next two
or three weeks. |

TWELVE MEN DECIDE TO |
.MAKE JUNIOR SPEECHES

When the call was made for men who};
were interested in: making Junior Speeches, |
about 12 responded. Of this the
four will selected, regardless of
which literary society they are members of. !
The preliminaries will be held about the 1st |
of April. The finals will be held Thursday |
night, April 17th, the winner receiving the |

This year Junior Speaking will be in no}
way connected with commencement, the fac- |
ulty not requiring each Junior to make a}
speech as it did in former times. The fac- |
ulty has agreed to let Junior Speaking be |
optional with the’ students. .Some believe |
that it should be done away with, while oth- |
ers see the benefit and good derived from it.|

The only kind of rabbit's foot that's any

good is the left hind foot of a croos-cyed
rabbit caught iby a red-headed nigger on a
Catholic’s grave in a graveyard in the light
of a full moon at midnight of Friday the
thirteenth.

But “The luck of the Trish” was not
caused by rabbit's feet or by snake's hips,
since old Saint Patrick ran the snakes out of
Ireland.—Lune A, Tick.

In the mind of every serious
thinking college man there arises a
question—"What am I going to do
after graduation?” This question
presents a serious crisis. It de-
mands a definite, decision.
