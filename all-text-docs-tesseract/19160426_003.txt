Emory at Agnes Scott recently the At-
lanta Alumni Association arranged for
the entertaining of our debaters, Patton
and Smith, and did all that they could
to make their stay in Atlanta as pleasant
as possible. The team was met at. the
station and conducted to the Hotel Ans
ley, where rooms had been arranged for
them. During their stay a luncheon was
given by the alumni at which the Dav-
idson “pep” was in ‘evidence, and at the
debate the alumni sat in a body to cheer
the team on.

The Atlanta association is one of the
livest that the college has and one of the
most loyal. Each month there is a
luncheon held at which all of the alumni
in Atlanta gather for an evening of
pleasure and reminiscences. In addition
the association is doing a good deal to
help the’ college in a material way and
make it a better and bigger Davidson.

LECTURE TO MEDICAL CLUB.

A very interesting and profitable lec-
ture was that given before the Aescul-
anian Club, the local medical club, on
Tuesday. April 18th, by Dr. R. S. Cun-
ningham, ‘11, who is now an instructor
in Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Cun-
ningham spoke of the advantages that a
man expecting to make medicine his life
work has in attending a good medical
school that sets a high standard of work.
The advantages as outlined by him were:
better training, inspiring influences from
close contact with great men in this pro-
fession, and the great value of a diploma
from a school that has a_ recognized
standing. The importance of being well
prepared for entrance was also stressed.

While Dr. Cunningham was here he
was entertained at the home of Dr. J.
W. McConnell. and spent several days
working with the students in the biology
laboratories.

On last Wednesday. Lillian. the ten-
vear-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.
B. Mooney, through accident swallowed
three bichloride tablets. Dr. J. W. Mc-
Connell was hastily summoned and thru
his efforts the child was. relieved and it
is thought no harm will come of the
mistake.

very interesting feature was the showing
of a set of stereopticon slides picturing
the Blue Ridge Student Conference
which is held every summer. E. P. Nis-
bet explained each of the views as it was
shown and at the conclusion of the series
T. D. Sparrow gave a ten-minute talk

outlining the work, plats, pleasures and |

benefits of the conference.

GOLF ‘TOURNAMENT

for the first of the week, with matches
between Drs. Currie and J. M. McCon-
nell; Dr. Arbuckle and J. W. Clark.
The winners of these matches will play

NOTICE.

The Students’ Council calls the at-
tention of the students to the fact that in
ancient and modern language work, the
use of books with translations interlined,
or with word translations inserted, on
reviews and examinations is considered
as “receiving aid” and of course such
work cannot be pledged.

It is requested of those having such
books that they submit the book to the
professor before taking the reviews or
examination, in order that he may make
any necessary change in the assignment,
or that new books be procured.

SHAKESPEAREAN LECTURES

Dr. M. G. Fulton delivered an illus-
trated lecture before the State Library
Association at its recent meeting in Gas

ford and London had in the formation
of his work as a dramatist.

Dr. Fulton also recently favored the
Senior English class with a stereoptican
lecture, showing views connected with
historical places mentioned in) Shakes-
peare’s plays. “This was the first of the
series of three,
