Weltner Talks,
Faces Issues

By TED GLUSMAN

Davidsonian Feature Writers
The news photographer’s lights were set up Mon-
day in chapel, and a larger-than-usual battery of micro-

phones occupied the rostrum.

and when Will Jackson got

The word spread quickly,

up to introduce him, there

were few in the audience.who were unaware that Charles
L. Weltner, Democratic representative from Georgia,

was paying a visit.

There were whispered conver-
sations among the more politi-
cally oriented students. No one
seemed to be neutral about this
man, and the why of all this
controversy was known before
he began to speak. The young
congressman was the only Sou-
therner to yote “yea” on the
civil rights bill, and when named
to the House Committee on Un-
American Activities, he shocked
Capitol Hill by suggesting and
backing an open investigation
of the Ku Klux Klan.

We settled back last Monday,
anxious to hear something we
could argue about from this
congressional non-conformist,

,But those of us ‘who heard him
only in chapel were disappoint-
ed.

BLAH TOPIC

Weltner's topic was that most
popular and most described of
all stereotypes, the educated
man. What he had to say was
said well, and it was interest-
ing. though it has been said be-
fore. He dealt mainly with the
age-old requirement of the edu-
cated man, that he not be over-
ly specialized.

The only political theme Welt-
ner touched in his talk was Hu-
bert Humphrey. Weltner bears
a great respect for Humphrey,
and he made that fact abundant-
ly clear. One student. in fact.
summed up Weltner's talk in his
own mind in three words: “I
Like Hubie.”’ But the jokes were
good (and for the most part
new), sometime all too rare in
such speakers, so we listened.

A-number of students followed
him to the Union for a ‘‘coffee
hour.” Those who did got what
we expected in chapel, a look at
some of the issues that have
made this man so controversial.

_ KKK FIRST

The KKK, of course, came
first. Weltner feels that the ma-
jority of his constituents would

Campus
Groups
Fight Law

Davidson’s AAUP chap-
ter and the student “Speak-
er-Ban committee continued
their efforts this week in;
calling for a repeal of the;
North Carolina Communist
“Gag Law.”

On Monday of last week an
editorial response from the
“Speaker-Ban” Committee of
the local AAUP was aired ony

(

WBT radio and WBT in Char-
lotte. The station had supported |
the “gag law’ in an editorial,
on the air in December.

Taking advantage of the sta-
tions’ invitation for listener re-
sponse, the Davidson committee
gave its rebuttal, in which the
professors contended that the
law is ‘‘misguided—even if well-
intended legislation.”

Letters from the public con-
cerning the committee's stand
have shown approval of the
move for repeal, according to
Dr. Richard E. Gift, spokesman
for the AAUP group.

The committee is also begin-
ning to receive response to a
letter sent to each AAUP chap-
ter in North Carolina.

Jim Waldron, organizer of the
seven-man student committee
which has been sanctioned by
the local AAUP. stated that his
group had drawn up a bill to
be presented at the State Stu-
dent Legislature in Raleigh this
weekend. Tom Scott, who along
with Bill Council and Chuck
Matthews is attending the as-
sembly, will sponsor the bill for
the student committee.

Seven campus groups or in-
dividuals so far have announced
their opposition to the law:
President D. Grier Martin,
AAUP, the Young Republican

Club, the college faculty, the |

student ‘“‘Speaker-Ban” com-
mittee, Student Council,

THE DAVIDSONIAN.

and

favor the investigation he pro-
poses, and he himself obviously
feels very deeply on the subject.
“Its strength is in its secrecy,”
he stated. His idea is to let
“plain truth combat this sec-
recy’.We have a right to know
who these people are,” be adé-

After speaking briefly on sev-
eral student questions, includ-
ing the so-called ‘Speaker Ban
Law’ (he sees no need in it),
Weltner spent the majority of
his time on the civil rights is-
sue.

His constituents are probably
largely against this one, he felt,
but Republican opposition in his
area has been a great help to
the Democratic party. The
Democrats have used this issue,
aceording to Weltner, to be-
come a more national party,
and thereby a more popular
one.

LAWS NOT ANSWER

In regard to new civil rights
legislation, Weltner feels that
what is needed is stronger en-
forcement. of previous laws, not
passage of new ones. Another
helpfut factor, he said. would
be a “better attitude of the peo-
ple.”

Pressing situations, such as
that in Selma, Ala., would be
solved, or could be solved,
opined Weltner, if all outsiders
would leave, including Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King—one of Welt-
ner's Atlanta constituents. Fed-
eral statutes should then be
“implemened and rigorously
enforced,”

The boyish, likable congress-
man impresses his listeners as
a young man on the move. He
has very definite views on ma-
jor issues and is willing to fight
for his beliefs. Whether one
agrees with the man’s ideas or
not, his aggressive, emphatic
personality demands admiration.

Members of the Fraternity Evaluation Committee
generally agreed this week that changes will be recom-

mended in

Meeting twice during the
week, the committee began
determining the actual con-
tents of the long-awaited
report. Prior to this week,
all discussion has been spec-
ulative: suggestions have
ranged from maintaining
the status quo to organizing
eating clubs to delayed rush,
even to abolishing fraterni-
ties.

The committee has’ held 11
meetings since its formation in
December. Robert Jones, assis-
tant dean of students, explained
that the committee, after ac-
cepting reports and students’
opinions, has now closed its
doors to deliberate and formu-
late its opinion and make its
final recommendations.

This, he said, is to give the
committee members an oppor
tunity to make their final opin-
ions and express freely their
convictions without pressure.

Bob Young, assistant director
of admissions, commented that
no specific suggestions or mo
tions have been made, and in
these final meetings they hoped
to keep personalities out of the
situation and avoid “‘persecu-
tion by peers’ in consolidating
the final report.

PROBLEM OF DEGREE

Ed Haselden, president of
Beta Theta Pi fraternity, feels
that the committee may or may
not suggest changes in the fra-
ternity system, and that the
problem could be one of de-
gree between the school’s obii-
gation to the fraternity system.
Action will be taken to remedy
the problem in either or both
spheres.

Young, a former fraternity
member, sees gtave shortcom-
ings in the fraternity system in
retrospect, and feels that a
change is definitely needed in
the system. He feels that fra-
ternities produce a dichotomy
among the student body.

Bill Council, a member of the
committee, definitely expects a
change to be recommended. One
possibility be elaborated oni
would be no rush next year. Af-

NOTHING DEFINITE

The concensus among mem-
bers of the committee is that
there will be some changes rec-
ommended, but no definite pro-
posals were suggested. Young
pointed out that each member
of the committee will have the
opportunity of drafting a minor-

Virs. Nash

By HEYWARD CARTER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

An uninhibited and incisive ap-
proach to the essence of sexual mores
captured for Dr. Ethel Nash this week
the usually elusive attention of the
Davidson audience. .

A lecturer at Gowman-Gray Medi-
cal School, the initial speaker in the
YMCA series on ethics gave the most
closely followed and best attended
talks presented this year.

In chapel Thursday she discussed
the sexual customs and trends in the
United States today. In comparing
them with those of Scandinavia she
actually drew response from the audi-
ence, something unheard of in chapel
sessions.

In all four talks. and discussions
Wednesday and Thursday, Dr. Nash
gave some extremely interesting and
valuable information and opinions.

Discussing the attitudes towards
sex at colleges which she had visited
she noted a definite sophistication and
knowledge of the subject by the vast
majority of students. This could be
seen here at Davidson especially in
the informal discussions where, for the
most part student reaction and par-
ticipation was decidedly mature and
sincere.

Responding to questions, Dr. Nash
was specific. Asked about U. S. porno-

aphy laws, she replied that she be-

eved pornography should not be ban-
ned, as this only makes it more inter-
esting and exciting. If one were al-
lowed free access to it he would be-
come used to it and would not, there-
fore, seek it. She, in fact, stated that,

Talks Sex

“A certain amount of looking at por-
nography is good for all of us at times.”
As to such works as the Kama
Sutra, only recently allowed in the
country, she regards them as healthy
if they teach us to become more Sex-
ually knowledgable, for “being a good
lover is a learned thing,” and an im-
portant one. ;

Dr. Nash said “I would be in favor
of legalized abortion on a much larger
seale than it is at present.” specifying
such causes as the birth of babies who
would be really unwanted as being
reason enough for abortion. She statec
that there are, in a conservative esti-
mation, 1,000,000 illegal abortions in
the U. S. every year.

This means that one out of every
50 or 60 women of child-bearing age
have an abortion every year, or that
the illegal abortion rate is -approxk
mately equal to the number 0 live
births in country.” This situation,
she feels, is foolish and impractical.

Questioned about the earlier ma-
turity of youth today and its relation
to pre-marital intercourse and younger
marriages, she said that there was in-
deed more pre-marital sex, but that
there was no real answer to the prob-
lem as of yet. Asked if she would favor
a trial marriage in cases like this, she
replied, “I would favor a trial engage-
ment much more, as nothing could
really be told from a trial marriage.”

conclusion, Dr. Nash foresees
much reform in Jaws concerning con-
traceptives and abortion, great im-
provements in “the pill,” more un-
derstanding on sex in the United
States, and a general re-evaluation of
sexual values in the near future.

mimeographed copies of his
election platform to distribute
among the students, and other
candidates were allowed 200
copies.

The council voted Monday to
adjust the number of copies al-
lowed candidates for various of-
fices. Candidates for student
body president will still be al-
lowed 500 copies, while candi-
dates for other student body of-
fices will be allowed 250 each.

Candidates tor president of the
YMCA will be allowed 400, and
those for Honor Court, fresh-
man advisor, Student Council
class positions, and president of
the College Union will be allowed
50 copies each.

The order of elections was al-
so changed. Previously, the fol-
lowing order was pursued on
subsequent days: (1) student
body officers; (2) Henor Court!
(3) YMCA president: (4) fresh.
man advisor, publications edi-
tors, president of the Colleg
Union, and cheerleaders; and
(5) Student Council.

This order was changed as fol-
lows: (1) student body officers,
Honor Court, and publications
editors, (2) cheerleaders and
president of the College Union,
(3) freshman advisor and presi-
dent of the YMCA, and (4) Stu-
dent Council.

Among defeated motions were
one requiring a one-dollar regis-
tration fee to defray costs of
elections and one allowing candi-
dates for student body offices

a motion to have no YMCA
speech in assembly during elec-
tion week this year.

mous choice of .the council to
chair the Elections Committee.
