PBASKET BALL

SEASON APPROACHING

The prospects for basket ball this
year are caceedingly bright. Coach
Fetzer has consented to coach the team,
and this assures a successful season, The
remodelling of the gymnasium gives a
goed court and ample room for con-
sistent practice. Heretofore the trouble
with the team has been the lack of a
court and good coach. “Vhis year both
have been provided, and there is no
reason why Davidson should not have a
team to be proud of. .

From last vear’s squad, McDonald,
Reese, Carson, Sommerville. and Laird,
are still in college. From the Fresh-
man ‘class, R. Walker made his letter at
Clemson in basket ball last) vear, and
Austin, who attended Se. Lukes, New
York, made all State prep. With these
men and several other promising Fresh-
men, Davidson is expecting a good team
this vear.

Mi anager McDonald is at work ‘ar-
ranging a schedule for next Spring.
Davidson ought to have a good basket
ball team. ‘This has been her greatest
defect in the athletic line. and a good
beginning should be made this year.

SOCIFTY CONSTITUTIONS
ARE AMENDED

The two literary societies. the Phi.
and the Fu., have recently passed
amendments to their constitutions re-
quiring every member to contribute at
least one article to the college Magazine
during the colegiate vear. Each mem-
ber, however, is permitted to choose the
character of his article, which may be
either fiction, poetry, essay, or an_his-
torical sketch.

In order that the editor of the Maga-
zine may receive all articles of the year
with due regularitv. the secretary of
each society has divided all members of
his society into classes equal to the num-
her of times the Magazine is issued dur-
ing the year, and the members of each
class are required to vlace their articlés
in the hands of the editor of the Maga-
zine by the 15th of the month on which
their articles are due. Each required
article will be counted as the equivalent
of one society credit if the editor of the
magazine deems such an article worthy
of a credit.

‘will be ‘keenly felt.

The Alumni Athletic

were very fortunate in. securing him as

Associ: ition

t assistant coach, for he has made an ideal

man for the place.

Yo him, along with Coach Fetzer, is
due in a great measure the success of
the season. The two have worked to-
gether in perfect harmony, and have
been a pair of coaches that could not be
excelled in the South. Harris was a
thorough student of the game. For sev-
eral vears he was coached by Fetzer at
Woodberry Forrest Prep School. and
was a star there. From there he went
to U. of Va.. where he plaved great ball
for four vears, and last year was an as-
sistant there. He has overhounded in
“nen” and life on the field, and has in-
stilled this into the sauad. His untiring
services here are deeplv apnreciated.

Those who came to really know him,
found in him a friend whose departure
He was one of the
most congenial, good- natured and gen-
tlemanly men ever me

From Davidson he left for his home
in Danville. Va., where he leaves im-
mediately to take un a bie cohtract in
civil engineering. Every Davidson man
wishes for him the greatest success,
