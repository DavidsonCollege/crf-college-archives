A strong team of Kappa
Alpha swimmers overcame 1st
Richardson and dove ahead to
a strong lead to capture the
annual IMAC swim meet last
night.

The preliminary races, held
Tuesday night, left teams
from K.A., P.D.T., 8.A.E.,
S.P.E., lst Richardson, and
the two man Emanon team of
Roberty Trawick and Craw-
ford Crenshaw to compete in
the finals. The K.A. contin-
gent, with several outstanding
individuals and two good relay
teams, seemed destined to win
from the start.

In the first race of the
evening, David Hardaway of
1st Richardson barely nipped
Foster Jennings in the 100 yd.
Freestyle; in the next event,
Hardaway’s teammate David
Herrington beat Pete West by
inches to take first place.

S.A.E. and S.P.E. teams
didn’t show for the 200 yard
Medley Relay, leaving the
K.A.’s and the Delts to battle
for first. The K.A. team of
Lane, Jennings, Cornish, and
Robinson got an early lead
behind Scott Lane’s backst-
roke and swam on to a
convincing victory.

mance, and his teammate Jim
Cornish edged Pete West and
David Herrington in an imp-
ressive 50 yard Butterfly race.

In the 50 yard Freestyle
Crawford Crenshaw took the

half.

The 177 pound match saw
Scott Phillips emerge with a
close 12-11 decision to keep
the Wildcats ahead 25-15.
Freshman Joe Saunders was
outweighed by 20 pounds in
the 190 pound bout and drop-
ped a decision. Jack Summe
wrapped up the Cat victory by
pinning his Campbell oppo-
nent.

The Wildcat grapplers com-
peted last Saturday in the
Bulldog Invitational at The
Citadel.

Freshmen Dulaney and
Phillips won their respective

‘ weight classes, and Davidson
collected a silver medal from
Jacobs and. bronze medals
from Scandling and Summe.

honors for Emanon, and K.A.
Scott Lane swam another very
fast race to finish first in the
50 yard Backstroke.

At this point the K.A.’s had
already clinched first place in
the meet, but second place was
tied 15-15 between Phi Delt
and lst Richardson. The final
race of the night, the 200 yard
Medley Relay, was the tie-
breaker, as the Delt team of
Strange, Cebul, J. Taylor and
Neikirk came in behind the
K.A. #1 team of Cornish,
Robinson, Jennings and Lewis
to capture second overall;
K.A. team #2 finished a close
third in the relay.

The final point totals were

Richardson 15, and Emanon 9.
Bryan Andrews, IMAC Coor-
dinator, said, ‘the meet went
very well, especially consider-
ing that I had never run a
meet before, much less been
to one.”

Alex English finished with a
game-high 31 points plus ten
rebounds for South Carolina
as all five of their starters
scored in double figures. Mike
Dunleavy was next for the
visitors with 15. Sophomore
guard Jackie Gilloon contri-
buted 14.

John Gerdy ied the David-
son scoring attack with 19
while Tom Dore added 12

more. Tom Jorgensen was the

only other Wildcat in double
figures with ten. Dore was
Davidson’s leading rebounder
with nine, and Gerdy followed
with six. Jay Powell, who had
only nine points, had ten
assists.

Tankers find season highs,
discuss weak, strong points

The Davidson swimming’

team’s 2-4 record is the only
factor in their season that has
not lived up to expectations.
According to team captain
Ron ‘‘Scoop” Owens and Jim
Wood, the leading point scorer
for the season, there have been
several bright spots.

Jonathan Washburn, who
has set several pool and team
records this year, is the
brightest spot, according to
Owens and Wood. The team
has lost its last two meets
against William and Marry
62-33 and Richmond; 53-37,
but Washburn set three re-
cords during these two meets.

Washburn broke two pool
records in the meet with
William and Mary, recording a
time of 2:10 in the 200

in the 200 Breast stroke.
Against Richmond he broke
the pool record in the 500

of 5:17.6.

In an earlier meet against
V.M.I., Washburn set two
team records, one in the 200
Backstroke at 2:14.6 and the
other in the 200 Individual
Medley at 2:08.1.

Coach Pat Drake is con-

‘sidered another asset for the

team. ;

‘‘She has done a great job
this year,” said Wood. “She
really knows a lot about
swimming, and has helped all

the swimmers a great deal.”
“The team has another pos-
sible bright spot in the future.
If we win four out of our last
six meets we will be the first
Davidson swimming team in
at least ten years to have a
.500 season or better,’’ said

’ Owens

According to Wood, how-
ever, this possible success will
probably not be observed by
many Davidson supporters.

‘In fact, the support has
been so bad that we only had
two people at one meet,” said
Wood. ‘‘We’ll set up chairs if
people show interest in watch-
