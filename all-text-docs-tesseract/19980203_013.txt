cert begins at 8:00
p.m. in Hodson
Hall of
Cunningham Fine
Arts Building.
Tickets are $12 for
adults and $8 for
students and se-
niors.”

The first half
of Chung’s con-
cert will consistof
Bach’s “Goldberg
Variations.” Fol-
lowing the inter-
mission, she will °
play Chopin’s
“Fantasy in F mi-
nor” and
Schubert’s “Im-
promptu in E-flat
major” and
“Improptu in G-
flat major.”

She will con-
clude with con-
temporary com-
poser Lee Hyla’s
1996 work, “Riff
and Transfigura-
tion, a Suite for
Piano.”

Chung was
playing as a soloist with the Baltimore Symphony
at age 12, and studied at Harvard and Yale before
earning a doctoral degree at- Juilliard. She is
currently artist-in-residence and assistant profes-
sor of music at Gordon College in Massachusetts.

Chung was first-prize winner of the 1993
Concert Artists Guild competition, and subse-
quently recorded her first CD — Beethoven’s
sonatas and bagatelles. That 1995 release by
Channel Classics was selected as one of the best of
the year by Gramophone. The magazine wrote of

er, “Chung’s performance is inspired... a totally
absorbing musical experience.”

She has released two more recordings since

Hall on Feb. 8.

that time, one of the works by Schumann and the
most recent of works by Beethoven.

Chung has also received the U.S. Trust
Award and the Channel Classics Prize, as well as
an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 1997.

A New
York Times re-
view of one of her
performances
called her perfor-
mance
“(u)ncommonly
insightful, indi-
vidualistic and
lively... Vividly
characterized and
full of dynamic
subtleties... Her
playing was daz-
zling.”

The Bos-
ton Globe’s mu-
sic critic wrote,
“She plays the
hardest music
there is with a de-
gree of intelli-
gence and musi-
cal sophistication
that is rare.”

Chung
has given recitals
in major concert
halls around the
world and played
concerto appear-
ances with the
Baltimore Sym-
phony and the Na-
tional Symphony. She has served as resident artist
of National Public Radio’s “Performance Today,”
as well as ‘“Artist-in-Radio” at WCRB in Boston
and WGMS in Washington, D.C.

ter National Bank in honor of the Coltrane family.

Student Health Advisors

First, we would like to say that the FLAG Fashion Show was lots of fun. Also, we appreciated

the attendance and enthusiasm of the student body, which demonstrates that Davidson College is
becoming a more open and tolerant institution.

For those of you who attended the Fashion Show, you will remember the four people who were

The Non-Act

painted blue. They wrote a poem that we would like to share:

We use blue paint to enable you to see
the shapes, curves, and lines of the body.

Bodies are different.
Bodies are smooth, skinny, fat,
muscular, hairy, tall, short,
and it is this combination that is the true beauty.

People are different.
People are conservative, straight,
gay, academic, radical, creative, spiritual,
and it is this combination that makes beauty.

We are presenting ourselves to you
this is honest, it’s not a game.
This is coming out.

FLAG is an appreciation
of the differences that we are.
We’re not just our characteristics and looks,
our characteristics and looks are us.
