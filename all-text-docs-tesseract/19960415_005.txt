possibilities of new
co-ed eating house

By KirstEN RECKNAGEL
Asisstant News Editor

There was no lack of ideas or
enthusiasm among those who at-
tended the open forum for a new
co-ed eating house, held the Thurs-
day before Easter Break. The fo-
rum provided an opportunity for
discussion of the many options
open to students interested in es-

tablishing a new eating house for «

both men and women.

Ross explained that the ad-
ministration is willing to support
students who have recently ex-
pressed an interest in creating such
a house, provided they see a firm
commitment on the part of stu-
dents.

While co-ed eating houses
have existed within the last ten
years, most were abandoned due to
lack of. student interest. In addi-
tion, an attempt to begin a co-ed
house failed two years ago.

However, interest in the so-
cial option seems once again to be
gaining momentum, as shown by
the 170 student signatures collected

ona petition in support of a co-ed
eating house option.

AtThursday evening’s forum,
organizer Lora Chavis, a junior,
voiced her opinion that “a ldt of
people are looking for a change in
the monotony.”

Forum participants strongly
agreed and seemed to be enthusi-
astic at the prospect of inventing
an additional option in Davidson’s
social scene.

Freshman Adam Hickey led a
free-response discussion as to what
kind of eating house students are
interested in creating.

Views on alcohol were ex-
plored, and suggestions included
proposals that the house be dry as
well as. proposals that the house
maintain a BYOB policy,

Forum organizers said they
would like to see a co-ed house
established next semester if pos-
sible. Freshman organizer Jordan
deBree reminded everyone that
“the formation of a co-ed eating
house is going to take energy and
trust in the administration.”

“Special day” will unite students,

community in service festival

National Youth Service Day,
held Tuesday, April 23, will con-
sist of three service projects and a
community dinner.

Reach-Out Vice-president Bill
Abrams says, “The event’s pur-
pose is to recognize the union of
the community and students
through service.”

Crosses

Freshman Julie O’Connor
then taped a list to the original
crosses: :

1. Easter is about resurrection
NOT the crucifixion.

2. No one needs FCA/IVCF/
others to dictate his beliefs.

3. Your morals aren’t better
than mine.

4. Not everyone is Christian.”

However, Sophomore Demian
Dellingertook down the signs from
the crosses. “I do not think
(O’Connor) had a right to put the
sign up on thecross," he says. "She
could put it up somewhere else.
We should all learn to respect each
other’s beliefs and question them
appropriately.”

Next, O’Connor put up a sign
repeating her statement in front of
the crosses. The sign had a sheet
on which she wished anyone who
agreed with her to sign.

That sign was then taken, and
O’Connor put her message on
large, red posterboard and placed
them on the columns of the North

* entrance of Chambers. These signs
stayed up for about half the day
before they also disappeared.

No disciplinary action was
taken on either side. The Dean of
Students only told O’Connor to
not put her message on the actual
crosses.

More than anything else, the
campus wondered about the proto-
col for displaying a certain group's
-message.

FCA President Eric Sapp says,
“There is a clear set of rules to
follow. Ittakes us two weeks to cut
through the red tape. You need
permission from the Dean of Stu-
dents Office and you have to take
credit for the display.”

Sapp defends the crosses. “Tt
is a freedom of expression. The
idea came from a FLAG display a
few years ago. It is interesting that
when a minority group does it no
one minds. When it is Christian, it
is like someone is ramming it down
your throat.”

He defends “The right of ev-
eryone to express their views," but
he wishes it could have been done
ina “less confrontational manner.”

O’Connor says she put up her
signs because she believes every-
one should be able to make their
own choice. “At this stage in our
lives we should all be able to
decide what Easter means," she
says, "But the groups putting up
the crosses inadvertently feel that
their views are the correct ones.”

She also adds, “The manner in
which I (opposed the display) was

not too different than the way they
did it. The crosses are put up each
day for everyone to view ona daily
basis, whether they wish to or not.
They could have put up an infor-
mation booth or table in Cham-
bers, where if people wanted to
talk with them, they could.”

She received a great amount
of feedback from her actions —

from both sides. “A plethora of —

students supported me. The stu-
dents who did not, anonymously
called, and left some fairly disturb-
ing thoughts. I wished I could
have discussed the matter with
them.”

Finally, O’Connor says, “I
plan to have an open forum on the
issue in the next couple of weeks.
I hope everyone will come so that
we [as acommunity] can learn and
grow from this experience.”
