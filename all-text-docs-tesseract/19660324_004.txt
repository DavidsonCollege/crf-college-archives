Sociologist McKinney _

Tells Of Growing South

By ALLEN WEBB
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Duke sociologist John C. Mc-
Kinney made a very scholarly
case in discussing the direction
of growth and change in the
South in Tuesday’s chapel.

Making the point that the
South is changing in the same
direction as the rest of the na-
tion and at a rate actually in
favor of the Southem region. the
Speaker filustrated his thesis
with numerous statistical ref-
erences that were met with what
the soft-spoken professor later
called “restlessness.”

After one long and very loud
whistle, McKinney smiled, said

K

In Student Art Interest

Several student artists at Da-
vidson have recently made out-
standing showings in exhibitions
and contests in the area. indi-
cating a possible rise in student
interest in art.

Three students, Daniel Goytia,
Woody Coleman and Lou Hill,
are taking advanced studies un-
der Douglas Houchens and all
three are now showing their
work in an exhibition in Char-
lotte,

These pictures, both drawings
and paintings, range from still
life, to modern or abstract art,
to pop art. Hill is the only one
who does any pop art and this
has consisted mainly of making
a large painting of a very small
.and seemingly insignificant com-
ic strip frame.

Hill says that he duplicates the
scene exactly bu: the fact that

“Thank you" and skipped over
further percentage references.

McKinney, who serves as
chairman of the Department of
Sociology and Anthropology at
Duke, is a tranpslanted Cali-
fornian who loves the South and
who applauds the many visible
changes that are having a deci-
sive impact on the South.

McKinney added that he does
not like the mass media‘s pic-
ture of the South as a “colorful
land full of Negroes, creoles,
mountaineers, snake handlers,
bootleggers, redneck sheriffs and
itinerant preachers.”

During most of his address.
McKinney decried the emphasis

~

on the intransigence of race re-
Jations in the South and the idio-
syncracies of Southern politics,
countering these charges with
references to strong trends of ur-
banization, industrialization, im-
proved transportation and accel-
eratéd economic development

“This is a time of concern for
traditional values,’’ the graying
professor said, “but new goals
will be reached after the reso-
lution of the imbalance between
verbal and real situations.”

In the cofee hour that foliow- ine concern for the future of the

Greek Week, the culmination
of all pre-initiation activities for
the pledges of Davidson‘s 12 fra-
ternities, has been set for April
4-8.

David Westfall, IFC Greek
Week Chairman. told THE DA-
‘| VIDSONIAN, “There aren't a
large number of activities spe-
._|eifically scheduled by the IFC
this year. We are trying to al-
low the fraternities to plan their
own activities and get away from
the traditional Hell Week."

Greek Week will officially be-
gin at noon, Monday, April 4.
That night an informal banquet

[ Solisti Veneti

[To Play Tomorrow

The Artist Series Committee
will present “I Solisti Veneti,”
a string ensemble from Venice,
at 8 p.m., tomorrow in Cham-
bers Auditorium as the last at-
traction in its current series.

I Solisti Veneti,. acclaimed
throughout Europe as one of the
most extraordinary ensembles of
our time, is composed of 16 in-
strumentalists. The conductor is
Claudio Scimonet, who teaches
special master classes for cham-
ber groups at the Conservation
Benedetto Barcello in Venice.

The ensemble was founded in
1959 by a group of young musi-
cians who were connected not
only by common studies at the
conservatories of Venice, Milan
and Padua but also by the fact
that they were born in the Vene.-
tian region.

Williams and Kerr also receiv-
ed Danforth Scholarships.
This year marks the 20th an-
niversary of the Woodrow Wil-
son Fellowship Foundation,

will be held on the grounds
atound Hodson Hall. Entertain-
ment will be provided by a folk
singing group composed of Doug
Pratt, Paul Marion, Dave Fore
and Henry Whitfield.

After the banquet, William Le-
Clere will address the pledges
and pledge trainers. LeClere is
executive secretary of Chi Psi
fraternity and chairman of the
Undergraduate Conference of the
National Interfraternity Confer-
ence.

Friday afternoon a field day
will be held at the Lake Cam-
pus. .In conjunction with this,
Sigma Phi Epsilon will hold its
annual Pledge Class Regatta.
The only important rule changes
from last year are that pontoon
boats will be disqualified and
that the total value of the boats,
not the cost, must be less than
$10.

The IFC is initiating a new
type of service project this year
which will be supported by the
combined pledge classes. This
project is the cleaning and prep-
aration of the Interfraternity
Purchasing Cooperative Associa-

tion storeroom, better known as |

the old bookstore at the rear of
Chambers Auditorium.

This year, the IFC is not offi-
cially requiring a Greek Week
service project for each frater-
nity.

This will allow the individual
fraternities more independence
in planning their own Greek
Week program without specific
directions from the IFC, other
than the rules and guidelines

which is the largest private
source of support for advanced
work in the liberal arts. Those
awarded fellowships will re-
ceive tuition and fixed fees at
the graduate school of their
choice, plus $1,600 for living ex-

which have been stated previous-
ly.

Judging for the Best Pledge
Class award this year will be
based partly on Greek Week ac-
tivity, but not as heavily as in
the past. The award, to be given
during the spring awards day,
will be based on three things:
pledge class scholastic average,
field day and regatta and per-
centage of blood donated during
the Red Cross blood drive in
April.

Greek Week will officially end
at midnight, Apri! 8.

The Danforth Fellowships, like
the Woodrow. Wilson grants, are
designed to encourage outstand-

selected college teaching as a
career and to help meet the criti-

Goytia is also full of ideas on
the significance and nature of
today’s painting. He says that
Modern art can be character-
ized by “freedom of expression
and individuality.”

He says that today an artist

it is on a much larger scale
makes it “say something about
American life today.”

Over the Christmas holidays,
Goytia entered a painting con-
test sponsored in Charlotte and
he recently learned that he took
second place. Another of Goy-
tia's works was chosen to be ex-
hibited in Charlotte in a contest-
type affair. College students in
the area submitted 360 paintings
but only 90 were selected to be
exhibited.

from Buenos Aires, Argentina,

scratches it out—but maybe if
it is something different, then
he will keep it.”’
