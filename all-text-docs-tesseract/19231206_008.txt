Lad From Warsaw Climbs High In,
Local Military Circles |

In the fall of 1g21 a green Freshman

entered Davidson straight from the
long, tall verdure of Warsaw, North
Carolina. He attracted attention from

the first on account of his erect military
carriage.

In addition to his regular R, O. T. C.
work he signed up in Oz Bethea’s Prus- |
sian Guards, together with Zeke Johnson,
Jim Pleasants, Beauty Jackson and the
Melver Twins, and distinguished himself
in the service.

In the spring he proved himself one of
the best marksmen in college and won|}
the and crap-shooter's
medals with little difficulty. The next
year he repeated, being the first man to |
win both medals for two
His admirers are looking for him |
to cop the honors again this year. |

On account of a broken leg he was!
unable to pursue his R. O. T. C. work last !
year, but has almost caught it this fall.
Inthe last three months he has done!
such splendid work and overcome his |
handicaps so that at a recent meeting of
the Student Body he was. unanimously
elected) Honorary Commandant of the
Davidson R. O. T. C. unit.

It is said that a sailor has a sweetheart
in every port. In addition to his strictly
military attainments Nathan upholds the}
honor of the army in this ogpection,|
and no sailor has anything one«mm.

He is contemplating the engineering
department of the service as soon as he
completes his education. His proficiency
at bridge will prove an invaluable aid
to him in the next war, for bridges are
an obsolute necessity in the transporta-
tion of troops. He demonstrates: his pro-!
ficiency daily.

Unfortunately, he seems to have con-|
tracted a bad case of facial paralysis |
lately, which has turned his usually
good-looking, countenance into a_per-
petual silly grin. The Davidsonian pho-|
tographer has attempted to secure him|
in this characteristic pose, but all at-)
tempts have failed. This unfortunate |
contortion can be seen at any period of
the day or night. |

The Warsaw people should be proud|
to claim the acquaintance of this illus-!
trious young officer who has so distin- |
guished himself. Mr.
ments have thrilled the ladies to such}
an extent that he no longer has to buy
movie magazines, AU the movie actresses
send him their portraits and besiege him
with offers of marriage.

So far he has successfully defended

years,

himself against these tempting proposals

in training for a generalship in the next
war.

thanks to all members of '27 who aided
in any way in securing this picture of
Davidson’s illustrious son for publica-
tion,

VOLUNTEER BAND MEETING

The meeting of the Volunteer Band

was held after “Y” services Sunday
a.

night. The meeting was led by Harry)

Price. Professor Fleagle spoke to the

band on “What I Have Seen of Foreign |
Mission Work,” from a layman's point
of view.

He spoke chiefly of Porto Rico, where
he had lived for a number of years. He
said that in his opinion preaching was
not all work by means.
Once the people converted there
must be “follow-up work,” as he express-
ed it, or the people fall into a sort of
mediocrisy and lose interest. Porto Rico
was formerly Catholic and the people
looked upon religion as a form.

Professor Fleagle asserted that he|
thought the Americans on the island a
great handicap to the missionaries by |
their social activities on Sunday. They |
do not live as the missionaries are trying
to teach the native sto live. The daily
life of all Americans in foreign countries

He said that the missionary

sent...One hears of the glowing moments
in a missionary’s life but does not think
of the long dull stretches that lay be-
tween these moments. These periods are
what make the missionary’s life so hard
to endure. Professor Fleagle expressed
the chief obstacles to the missionary’s
life as being opposition by the Catholics
and other people and indifference on the
part of the natives.

The talk then turned to the great
amount of good done by the educational
work and hospitals. The occupation
schools are largely self-supporting and
are doing great things for the younger
people. Then the great-hearted, unself-

yish doctors and nurses are giving up

everything to comfort thése people who
so sadly need their care. The hospitals
generally charge something. sometimes
only five cents, but this keeps the people
from feeling as though they were ac-
cepting charity.

MEMBER OF MINISTERIAL
BAND TO SPEAK AT HOME

An extensive deputation program is
being conducted by the Ministerial Band.
Already several important deputations
have been sent out, and plans are being
made for-a number of others in the im-
mediate future, ;

Last Sunday, Guiton and McLean vis-
ited the Church of the Covenant, in
Greensboro, and spoke at the Sunday
services. They report an excellent at-
tendance at all of the meetings.

It is being planned to send a man from
the Ministerial Band to Hobson's Chapel,
mission of the First Presbyterian
Church of Mooresville, to fill the pulpit
on every first Sunday.

This is a newly

| organized church and is without a pas-

tor at the present time.

The committee on deputations has. also
written to the churches to which mem-
bers of the band belong to arrange for
them to speak in their home churches
during the Christmas holidays.
