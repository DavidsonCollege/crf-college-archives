Bad Bernard lists IMAC all-stars

By BAD BERNARD AND
BONEHEAD >
IMAC Columnists

Regardless of what you may
have heard, the simious and
addle-brained duo of Bad Ber-
nard and Bonehead are back on
the job with hundreds of bogus
and deceitful stories to report.

However, we can say in all
honesty that the cold winter
‘month of December is now upon
in and just as this is the season
in which the great furry Caty-
wampus must return to his cave
to avoid the cold and winter
chills, it is also the time when
all loyal Davidson students
must seek shelter in Johnston
gym to avoid the ‘frigid sur-
roundings”’ on campus. In other

words it is IMAC basketball ’

season. (arf-hooray und other
assorted exclamations and in-
terjections!)

Last year’s A-league cham-
pions, the SAE’s, were hurt by
graduation in the frontcourt. To
replace these losses (Bondurant
6’5’’, Daisley 6’4”’, Brown 6’4’’),
the E Baggers signed former
Davidson varsity players
Danny Hock and Locke White.

Hock, a 6’5’ junior, posses-
ses a silky smooth jumper, and
White, also a junior (although a
non-SAE), has lightning speed
in the backcourt and is also a
superlative shooter. Once they
blend with the returning nu-
cleus (Andy McDonald, Tim
Goodell, Stoney Reuning, and
Adrian. Wilson), it would take
an idiot to say this team won’t
be a contender.

strong challenge from both the

_ Excitable Boys and Bye. The

Excitable Boys are basically a
New York all-star team’ with
Kevin Doherty and Bob Lapple
leading the way.

Bye, a team which could
easily win. it all come February,
consists of former Wildcat cager
Kirk Combe, sophomore ,sky-
walker Rand Malone, and \6’7”
David Jones. More about the
teams later; now a focus on this

year’s all IMAC players.

Andy McDonald -- forward --
SAE -- a complete player, swept
all honors last season as: he
grabbed the MVP in the A-

league tourney as well as the —

player whose strongest points
are his amazing ability to move
without the ball and his pass-

Kevin Doherty -- forward --
Excitable Boys -- an all-city
player in NYC during his high

school days, had 14 against ~

UCLA his freshman year, a
natural leaper who can two-
hand reverse dunk with ease,
proved last season against VMI
and Appy St. that he svill pos-
sesses a jumper good from 18
feet, 6’3’’.

Danny Hock -- center -- SAE
-- two years experience on the
Davidson varsity, a big man

good up to 15 feet, willing to get

true hustler. ;
Tim Goodell -- forward -- 674”
- SAE -- most underrated
player in IMAC, critics say he
is a poor leaper and fails in the
transition game, but he easily
compensates with his smooth
play, nice shooting touch, re-
bounding agility, and team
attitude, and will eventually be

- lost to baseball like Lapple.

Kirk Combe -- forward -- 6’5”
-- Bye -- graduated from DC in
76, experience on some excellent
Wildcat cage teams, senior year
his IMAC team (I Felta Thigh)
swept it all, a rugged player
who performs in the clutch, an
excellent shooting touch.

Minor Sinclair -- guard -- 6'1”
-- Wagon Ho -* a player who is
excellent around the bucket, is
weak in the physical game, but
he possesses a soft shot and can
often out-finesse his stronger
opponents, must provide more
rebounds for Bye to win it all.

Adrian Wilson -- guard --
6'0" -- SAE -- a gutty player
who excells in backcourt skills,
a fine dribbler and passer,
ignites the explosive SAE fast
break, during his tenure at
Davidson he has won the 3 on 3
championship three times and
the A-league 5 on 5 title twice.

Honorable mention all-

TEAM CAPSULES:

SAE -- (1) -- a solid favorite
to repeat for the third straight
year as IMAC champs. No
visible weaknesses, team has no
gunners or ball hogs (a surprise
anytime there is this much true
hoop talent around). Hock must
accept role as chiefly a rebound-
er once Goodell leaves for
baseball if team is to win at all.

Bye -- (2) -- might be a
favorite but there are too many
“ifs."’ What if this team had a

true point guard? With their
horses up front they would be
deadly. Jones must average
eight to nine rebounds if the
team is to win. Hodge is a tough
competitor and will surprise
many with his non-stop hustle.

Excitable Boys -- (3) -- would
be ranked higher but Lapple
and Doherty will not be around
for the IMAC tourney as they
both have baseball obligations.
With the two players however,
there is no telling who they
could beat (the SAE’s, UNCC,
or even the Squatty Bodies).

Droogs -- (4) -- might be too
high of a ranking for this team
of all freshman football players,
team center Matson had two
dunks in season opener and star
guard Craig Binkley had 30
points. Other players-on the
team, though, appear to have
seen a basketball for the first
time last week.

Hurtin for Certain -- (5) -- a
young quick team which lacks a
true center, no way this team
can win it all, but they might
have a say in just who will.
Could upset a stronger team if
they used a delay game.

Wagon Ho -- (6) -- team has
some talented players in Bark-
ley, Sinclair, and Horn but first
must overcome the poor play of
its own players like Barry
Sachtjen and Harry Griffith.

Five Easy Pieces -- (7) -- too
early to tell just what they will
have. ;

Bone Crushers -- (8) -- ditto.
Later.

In Women's games, the Silly
Rabbits won big over the Bark-
land’s Babes, 48-10. Twice as
Nice, last year’s championship
team, won their first game by
forfeit over Hot to Trot. Hope
McArn and Cathy Inabnet
should help Twice as Nice give
the Rabbits some stiff competi-
tion.

Other action included the
19-17 overtime win of the Bops
over Three’s Company. This
victory marked a milestone in
the life of IMAC President John
Ratliff, as he recorded his first
win ever as coach.

The Penthouse Rowdies Plus
defeated P and the Button-
downs by a score of 18-14.
Martha Frye was top scorer for
the Rowdies. Ruskeller, led by
Ann Clark easily triumphed
16-6 over Wrong! The Amazing

Greys edged the M&M's 20-16.

Cattes drop first

By ROB GILLISON
Staff Writer

Despite Sarah Womack’s 22
points and 13 rebounds, the
Davidson Wildcattes fell to
Converse in their season’s first
contest, 58-43,

The Wildcattes led through-
out most of the first period but
a late surge by Converse tied
the score at halftime.

Converse opened the second
half with a full-court press that
disrupted the Davidson offense.
Wildcatte Coach Susan Roberts
said, “The girls just fell apart.”’
The press’ caused ‘repeated Da-
vidson ball-handling mistakes

that allowed Converse to attain
its final 15 point advantage.
“The girls definitely have the
potential to be winners,’’ said
Roberts after the loss, ‘‘but our
inexperience showed through.”’
‘We also need more than two
scorers,’’ Roberts added, refer-
ring to efforts of Womack and
Kirby Owen, who garnered 12
points. ‘Our goal right now is

_to keep on improving.”

The Wildcattes travel to Ben-
nett College in Greensboro Fri-
day, and to Davidson Commu-
nity College in Lexington next
Thursday.
