The quintet made no mistake
when it elected “C.C.C.” Quick as

With only the one court on the
campus, it is pretty hard on both
coaches and players. There are
three teams that have to practice
nearly every day and the same gym
is used for intra-mural games. All
this is not meant to criticize, but is
just a way of getting around to
making the suggestion that some
of the Centennial money about
which we have heard quite a bit
might well be used to put up a more
adequate gym and the old one left
