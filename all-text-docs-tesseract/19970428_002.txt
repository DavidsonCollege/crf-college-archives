Burk gives trustee meeting update

Buster Burk attended the Trustee conference
during the past week and reported its events at last week’s student
government meeting. He learned the phonathon raised $70,000; three
new trustees were inducted; a financial aid resolution was passed Stating
that 11.5% of the budget should go towards financial aid; most dorms
should be wired for internet access within 12-18 months; a campaign to
raise money for anew track is beginning; an appendage to Johnston Gym
is being considered as it will be converted into the new Union; and that
the admissions office's top priority is international students.

SGA to vote on ATC budget tomorrow

For any interested students who wish to voice their concerns
regarding the Activities Tax Council’s apportioning of student money
to chartered organizations, they should attend Tuesday night’s SGA
meeting at 9 P.M. in the Union Conference room. The body will be
voting on whether or not they approve the ATC’s allocation of some
$308,000 to different organizations. All organizations initially asked for
a total of $343,000. It is the responsibility of the ATC to recommend to
the SGA how to adjust the intended figures to the available amount.

Lecturer describes English and
Indian encounters in America

By STEPHEN CEFALU
Staff Writer

Davidson College’s Spring
1997 Kelley Distinguished Lecturer,
Dr. Karen Ordahl Kupperman, a
professor of history at New York
University, presented her talk, “Eu-
ropeans’ and Indians’ Perceptions
of Each Other in Seventeenth Cen-

‘tury North America,” on Tuesday.

Kupperman’s discourse most
specifically addressed the varied
responses of sixteenth and seven-
teenth century English writers to
Native Americans encountered in
and around early settlements in
North America.

Most intriguing was
Kupperman’s suggestion that these

, pioneering English scribes saw in
Native America many elements of
their own country’s lost but storied
past. “The Indians’ lives constitued
a living reproach of the modern
English way of life, particularly its
faltering attention to matters of hos-
pitality,” Kupperman said.

The English writers drew upon
the works of ancient historian
Cornelius Tacitus in comparing the
highly egalitarian customs, ways
and traditions of the Native Ameri-
cans to those of the ancient Ger-
mans and Romans, and their own
Anglo-Saxon predecessors.

Dr. Kupperman holds degrees
from the University of Missouri,
Harvard, and Cambridge. She has
published five books; the most re-
cent of which, Providence Island
1630-1641:.The Other Puritan
Colony , won the American Histori-
cal Association Beveridge Prize in
1993 for the best book in American
History.

process of completing her sixth his-
torical work, Apprehending Native
America, research from which
served as the focus for her lecture
Tuesday evening.

Davidson Professor of History
Russell Snapp called Kupperman’s
presentation “most informative and
enjoyable.”

Rhea tenure case raises difficult issues

By ANN Cup
News Editor

Ata liberal arts college such as
Davidson, what is the properly bal-
anced emphasis -between teaching
excellence and scholarly output?

The case of Mitch Rhea, assis-
tant professor of chemistry, proves
just how confusing determining that
balance can be. Last week, the
trustees voted not to give Rhea ten-
ure. The Trustees’ decision endeda
student effort to prevent his dis-
missal.

Chemistry majors and non-
majors wrote letters or contacted
President Kuykendall, Dean of the
Faculty Robert Williams, and the
Board of Trustees on the part of
their professor.

The faculty handbook requires

* student input be “ascertained by

means of interviews, letters, evalu-
ation forms, or other methods.”

“Course evaluations are the
most important student solicitation,”
says Williams. “They are read by
myself and the department chair in
year two of the tenure process.
[Rrofessors are reviewed for tenure
in their sixth years of teaching, their
evaluations are reviewed in years 2,
4, 6.] It is a very qualitative form,
but it is very informative.”

Many current Chemistry stu-
dents felt that their voices were not

heard.

“I was going to write a letter,
but was told, “Don’t bother,” be-
cause Dean Williams won’t read
them,” says junior Thu Thieu.

“Any letter a student writes is
taken seriously. We don’t want to
exclude any evidence,” says Will-
iams. “Unsolicited letters are sent
straight to the department, because
we don’t want the Faculty Tenure
Committee to see stuff not seen by
the department. Our response to
those is just ‘Thank you very much.’
Letters to Trustees become like a
iprivate communication since that is
not part of our procedure.”

The tenure process emphasizes
teaching, professional attainments,
and intellectual and moral values.
“Professional attainments are
judged by the department chair,
colleagues in the department, and
colleagues in other departments who
have worked in closely related fields
of scholarship.... In the matter of
publication, quality is deemed more
significant than quantity,” accord-
ing to the Faculty Handbook.

“Everyone is disappointed, but
there’s a bigger picture than what
students see. From our point of
view, we think he should have got-
ten it, but the students don’t know
as muchas the Faculty Tenure Com-
mittee. I think they [students] were
acknowledged, but did not influ-

ence the process. I think the admin-
istration was sensitive to students’
voices,” says junior Andrew Coates.

Thieu does not agree. “The
whole thing was frustrating, because
no one was sure if our letters and
talking to people would help,” she
says.

The Dean’s office attempts to
make the tenure review process as
fair as possible.

“Student evaluations of faculty
as teachers are taken very seriously,”
says Williams. “On the other hand, -
that is only part of the picture. Fac-
ulty are evaluating on a professional
level. The course evaluations are
balanced against what faculty say.
Faculty judge their peers and apply
the standards of the code in their
area.”

Rhea’s case makes some stu-
dents question the review process
overall.

“TI have a tenured professor in
the Chemistry departmentrightnow
who is not half the professor Dr.
Rhea is,” says one Chemistry ma-
jor. “I think it is unfair that the
decision of giving tenure is based
so much on research, because thatis
not what I pay for and that is not
what my parents pay for. They pay
for a quality education. I feel like I
got areally good education with Dr.
Rhea, and it is a big loss to other
students who have not had him yet.”
