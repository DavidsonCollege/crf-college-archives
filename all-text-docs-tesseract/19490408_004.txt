concluding «service, Dr. Heaton be-
gan by illustrating the weakness of
Christianity as due to the fact that

so few “Christians” are like Jesus
Christ. So many have a thin coat
of Christiantiy which may give

warmth, but it is not relevant to the
realities of life, and has no applica-
tion to life. When the Kingdom of
God comes out of this earth, it will
come through men—men with ap-
plied Christianity. The words from
the Old Testament, “Do justly, love
mercy, and walk humbly with thy
Lord” would make religion relevant
to daily life. God made his supreme
attempt confront men with a
religion relevant to life when God
Himself’ came into this world in
the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus
showed men their lack of honesty,
justice, mercy -and love and said
they were like white-washed tombs.
But these ancient people, not want-
ing a religion relevant to life, cruci-
fied their Savior. The less relevant
we make religion, the closer upon
us come the devouring beasts of
evil. “Let your light so shine before
men’—make the religion of Jesus

to

Christ relevant in every part of life.
