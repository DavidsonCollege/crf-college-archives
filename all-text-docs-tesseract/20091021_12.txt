’Cats continue SoCon hot streak with
home wins over Wofford and Furman

JOHN MorGAN

Marching into the final two
weeks of the regular season, the
*Cats are rolling off five wins in
their last six games, including a
home stand sweep over the week-
end. After losing to Charleston be-
fore fall break, the team rallied to
take out The Citadel, Wofford, and
Furman over the last two weeks.

The College of Charleston
match on Oct. 8 featured a flurry of
offensive strikes by the Wildcats,
but no scores. Leading the over-
all shot tally 21-5, including 11
shots on goal, Davidson dominated
the flow of the game. However, a
Charleston goal in each half put an
end to the two-game win streak at
Alumni Stadium.

For the fall break special, the
*Cats visited Charleston, SC on
Oct. 11 to challenge The Citadel.
The stat sheet shows a similar style
of game play—24 shots from the
Wildcat feet, and only 6 from their
opposition. Fortunately, the David-
son D limited the pressure on keep-
er Jessie Baxa °12, who stopped all
three Citadel shots on goal.

On the offensive front, Blakely
Low °10 and Kyri Bye-Nagel ’10
each ripped shots within the first
fifteen minutes of the game. Low
finally connected on her second at-
tempt, drilling in her fifth goal of
the season from several yards out.
She leads the team in scores on the
year.

Though the Wildcat squad
would not find the back of the net
for the remainder of the game,
Low’s early success proved deci-
sive. The ’Cats grabbed a 1-0 shut-
out and returned to their earlier pat-
tern of conference wins.

After two weeks of sweeping
offensive control, without enough
goals to show for it, the ’Cats re-
versed the trend against Wofford
on Oct. 16. This go-round, David-
son put up a 19-shot display against
their opposition at Alumni Stadium,
controlling the ball movement from
the opening kickoff.

Early in the 28th minute, Low
snuck her way into the box with
some dazzling maneuvers and
rocketed a shot at the Wofford
keeper. The shot rebounded, but it
followed a direct course back to
Low, who bounced in a header for

cats’ 1-0 win over the Paladins on Sunday. Bye-Nagel scored the
game’s only goal on a header in the 51st minute for Davidson.

the first goal of the match.

Just a couple minutes later, Low
nabbed a throw-in directed toward
the top commer of the box. A few deft
dribbles and she doubled her scor-
ing tally for the evening, lofting a
deep ball around the far post.

Seven minutes later, and the
*Cast still weren’t done yet. While
the team forced itself into a de-
fensive drudge match against The
Citadel, the players sought a safer,
more decisive lead. Allison Dru-
tchas *11 nailed in a free kick in
the 38th minute for the third goal
of the game and her second of the
season.

Resting on a comfortable lead,
Davidson coasted through the sec-
ond half at Alumni Stadium. Lor-
ing Ward °10 rested between the
pipes, notching three saves from as
many attempts on goal. Bye-Nagel
earned another point on the year

with only a few minutes left on the
clock, lofting a lob to Elizabeth Un-
derwood ’12 who connected with a
header to leave the game at 4-0.

On Sunday afternoon, Oct. 18,
the ’Cats hosted Furman for the last
game of their successful weekend
at home. Furman, boasting a re-
spectable 10-4 record, proved com-
petitive throughout the matchup.
With Ward again in goal, Davidson
dug in for another low-scoring war
of attrition.

In the first half, neither team
capitalized much on offense, play-
ing position ball to avoid any costly
mistakes. In this game, one goal
decided the victor. Heading into the
locker room tied nil-nil, the squads
regrouped for offensive campaigns
in the second half.

Wildcats score late, slip

past Paladins 2-1

The past few weeks have held
a great deal of excitement for Da-
vidson men’s soccer, as the team
earned a national ranking of 21.
Davidson went on to drop their first
two games after being ranked, first
to Elon and then to Appalachian
State on Wednesday night.

The team managed to bounce
back after two straight conference
losses and captured a vital win
against Furman on Saturday night
at Alumni Stadium, putting David-
son right back on track improving
to 10-3 on the season.

On a wet and chilly Wednesday
night, Davidson battled Appala-
chian State but could not pull off
a win. Suffering their first shutout
of the season, Davidson could not
manage to score on very close of-
fensive attempts.

Davidson’s defense was noth-
ing less than superb though as they
allowed only one goal on the night
and did not let Appalachian State
score until the 54:53 mark when a
pass off a free kick was chipped in
just inside the six yard box to put
Appalachian State up 1-0 and seal
the victory.

Recouping immediately from
their disappointing two-game skid,

Davidson fought a fierce opponent
at Alumni Stadium, defeating Fur-
man by a score of 2-1 on another
freezing Saturday night.

Davidson got off to an early
lead at the 17:50 mark when Alex
Caskey °11 headed a pass from
Furman at mid-field and Yannick
Pilgrim ’11 stole the rebound from
a Furman defender, streaking down
the right side of the field. Charlie
Reiter °10 remained close behind
Pilgrim as he ran downfield. Pil-
grim crossed it to Reiter who fired
a goal from inside the 18 yard box,
putting Davidson up 1-0.

Wasting no time, Furman fought
back sending a powerful strike into
the top left corner of the goal just
over the fingertips of Chip Sanders
12.

The score remained tied for
most of the game until Reiter sent
a lead pass to Pilgrim. Pilgrim then
created his own offense when he
broke free from his defender and
dashed down the field showing
his superior speed. Pilgrim sent a
cross to a streaking Josh Zipin ’11
who fired a goal through a defend-
er’s legs and past the diving keeper
from 10 yards out near the left post
for the 2-1 win at the 82:17 mark.
