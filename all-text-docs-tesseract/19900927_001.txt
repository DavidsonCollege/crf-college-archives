Davidson's Athletic Resurgence:
Soccer 20th in Nation, Football 3-1

By BRUCE BALESTIER

There were signs last spring
that good things were afoot in
Davidsonathletics. Terry Holland,
universally regarded as one of the
finest basketball coaches in the
land, relinquished his post as head
coach at Virginia to return to his
alma mater as athletic director. He
convinced his old friend Dave
Fagg, then associate football coach
at Arizona, to return to Davidson
as head football coach. The trus-
tees voted to distribute grants-in-
aid to women athletes. There was
an obvious new spirit in Davidson
athletics, but thatrecognitiondidn’t
prepare us for the phenomenal
success of nearly every team so far
this fall.

Since his arrival in 1980, head
soccer coach Charlie Slagle’s pro-
gram has been a model of consis-
tency, achieving six winning sea-
sons in ten years and a winning

- season just over .500. All of this is

when. one considers

ce aE ‘Davidson isthe smallest Divi-
Senior Terry Hines inoce wer Hotort and Henry Sees in Davidson's

sion-I school in the nation and
givesnosoccerscholarships. What
is yet more remarkable is what the

team has done thus far this fall.

This year’s edition has simply
found the right mix, Experienced
players like Scott Zucker, Peter
Cobb and Rob Ukrop have an-
chored the squad. Precocious so-
phpmores like Phelps Sprinkle and
Lance Kinerk have played above
their years. Freshmen have con-
tributed as well; midficldcr John
Sampers found the net twice in the
Wildcats’ 3-2 win at Duke.

With impressive wins over
Richmond, Cincinatti, South Ala-
bama and Duke, the 9-1 Wildcats
have vaulted into the national rank-
ings at 20th, an amazing feat fora
sh f our sizc..Our ranking of
4th in the South is Davidson’s
highest ever.

Even as recently as last ycar,
the football program was a dc-
pressed one. It was a program still
smarting from an txodus of qual-
ity players aftcr the drop to Divi-
sion III. But last scason’s two vic-
tories under Vic Gatto were the
most in recent years. Three of the
team’s losses were by asum of five
points, and there were defeats at
the hands of powerhouses Wagner
and Dayton. There were, in short,

signs of compcetitivencss.

Coach Fagg brought with him
a new attitude; he stressed a fam-
ily-type atmosphere. He played the
fight song very often, hundreds of
times by his own admission. He
brought with him as well a rccruit-
ing class of over 30 freshmen to
provide much-necded. The stage
was sect.

Sincc thcir opening loss to the
University of the South, the Fight-
ing Wildcats have not Ict up. They
have charactcristically founda way
to win, coming from behind with
explosive offense against Millsaps
and Emory and Henry, protecting
a Icad with staunch defense to
defeat J.C. Smith. A winning sca-
son would be just our second since
1969.

On the women’s side, itsecms
that the trustecs realized that they
could notcontinuc to expect tcams
toachicve success with mirrors. In
order to compete with bigger,

scholarship-giving schools,
Davidsen-must distribute grants-
in-aid to womenathictes. Presuma-

Acquaintance Rape at Davidson:
Students Not Only Victims But Perpetrators

By KATHRYN STRICKLAND

- [Editors' Note: Because date
rape is a major issue on college
—camp: .,
opinion ‘s piece is worthy of re-
ceivng student attention. As a
result, we have placed this article
on the front page.]

Two years ago twenty-eight ~

Davidson men chose this slogan
for their freshman hall jersey, “She
was date-raped on 3rd West, and
all I got was this lousy t-shirt.”
They printed “But if she came it
didn’t count” on the back. Today
students still mock the acquain-
tance rape issue.

Two weeks ago a Davidson
woman received this anonymous
message on her answering ma-
chine: “Bitch, [know who youare,
and I know where you live, and
one night late when you are walk-
ing back from the library, I am
going to find you, and I am going
to rape you like a ----ing dog.”

-  Whethera threat ora bluff, the
call is acrime. The administration
suspects a Davidson student, not
an outsider left the message.

Last year two women reported
acquaintance rapes to the Dean of
Students’ Office; three. students
reported attempted rapes, and no
one filed a sexual harassment

complaint.

Nationally, one out of seven
college women is raped on cam-
pus--more than half of these vic-

“There is no reason to believe
this statistic does not hold true for
Davidson,” says Leslie Marsicano,
Assistant Dean of Students.

Why then don’t Davidson
women report the crime? Guilt,
humiliation, not wanting anyone
to find out, and fearing no one will
believe them are commonanswers.

Attitudes that mock acquain-
tance rape exacerbate fears and
prevent a victim from reporting
thecrime. One female student who
did not report an attempted ac-

quaintance rape responded, “I just -

wanted to forget about it. I didn’t
want to muddy. the waters espe-
cially since his father is a very
prominent businessman.”

- These feelings, although
understandable, do not protect the
victim or other female students.
One Davidson male commented,
“Ti’s worse when a girl does not
report the rape, then guys think
she’s indifferent to it or even liked
it.” :
The administration promises

confidentiality and flexibility. The -

victim possesses several options:
reporting the crime without prose-

cuting,confronting her assailant in
the presence of a staff member,
prosecuting under the Code of
Responsibility, and or pons
criminal charges. SRE PRS
A Davidson woman attacked.
by an acquaintance the fall of her
freshman year tells why she let the
attack go unreported and how the
administration responded when she
finally did disclose the incident.
“T told the Dean of Students
office a year and a half after the at-
tempted rape. Until then I did not
feel the administration posscssed
the sensitivity and awarencss to
handle my situation. When it hap-
pened, I wanted to tell someone
desperately, but doubted the Dean
of Students would believe me or
even care. I felt helpless. The issue
had never been openly discussed
on my hall, What could I do?”
“Last spring, I attended a Rape
Awareness Committee meeting
where Leslie Marsicano spoke,”
she continues. “She seemed will-
ing to listen and ready to take ac-
tion. It was the first time I had ever
made my appointment with Leslie.
Finally, someone in a position of
power knew the problems
Davidson women face. That felt
