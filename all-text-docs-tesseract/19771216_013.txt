Faculty impressions : of grades, involvement

By ANN GARNER
Focus Editor

Is the Davidson student the com-
placent, socially oriented, ‘‘grade-
grubbing”’, and unimaginative person
that seems to typify the student of
the '70’s? The impressions of several
professors prove to be remarkably
similar.

‘‘There are some obvious things
going on,”’ observed Professor of

Sociology, Norman B. Koller,“‘The

students are generally more conserva-
tive, are showing a renewed interest
in fraternities, which reflects an
interest in social life, and a greater
desire to fit in, of being liked more.”’

Professor of Religion, Daniel D.
Rhodes agreed,‘‘Contrary to the acti-
vistic period of the '60’s, there is now
more of a mood among students
desiring to find their place in the
social order as it is coupled with a
desire to opt into the established
professions.”

David E. Shi, professor of history
elaborated further, ‘“There are larger
factors at work: we are in a general
period of prosperity and peace and the
students,unlike those of the 60’s were
encouraged to look at and question

themselves. They have, as a result .
developed a ‘step-ladder’ approach to

life. ae a

‘Today students float into career
choices without considering why,” Shi
continued. ‘‘whereas Socrates defined

. the purpose of education as ‘to know
thyself,’ students in keeping track of _-

his checklist -college, grades, gradu-
ate schooly may lose sight of who he
really is. Nenetheless, there is more
pressure to make the grades if he is to
fulfill these career plans.”

Although maintaining that David-
son students ‘‘come in all stripes,”
professor of English, Randy F. Nel-
son observed that these students
“tend to be a little-more nervous and
high strung. They are clearly more
worried about grades and about
absorbing material, but then many
express a clear interest in learning.”’

Rhodes added, ‘‘The student is in a
bind: he has to be grade conscious to
stand a. chance to follow out what he
wants to do. I don’t like it but I can’t
sit back and blame the student as

‘ competition increases for graduate

and professional schools. Yet in a
sense its too bad that so much
emphasis has to be put on grades.”

- Locke White, Jr. also noted, ‘The
employment prospects are simply not
as good as they were. In this respect
. the contern for grades appears quite
plausible. In view of the outside

NY

world, I'd see it as miraculous if
students weren’t more concerned.”’

Yet, Rhodes expressed another
disconcerting aspect: ‘‘An intense
emphasis on grades tends to push
students into taking elementary
courses, except where they can’t get
away from it in their major field. aby
would be perfectly capable but want
to protect that average so that it
won't get hurt.”

Shi reiterated, ‘I’m not sure that a
student can still take. advantage of

what a Liberal Arts education really
is: the ability to take courses for
interest rather than a grade. But in
that sense, Davidson is really part of
the system in that we’re a training
ground for other things.”’

“What Frontis Johston said. “That
a Liberal Arts education should
instill its graduates with the ability to
do almost anything’ doesn’t apply
anymore,” continued Shi.

Dean of Students Will H. Terry
pointed out ‘‘students are more career
oriented, less graduate schoo! orien-

ted and more directed towards the
business world which, I feel, is more
realistic.””

Koller commented, ‘‘We’re going
back to the 50’s in the concern with
career and job and not so much with
issues. Now students talk about those
who try and get them interested in
issues as ‘stirring up trouble.”

Postulating further, Professor of
German, Hansford Epes stated,

“Part of my judgment has been that
the minority visible as being highly

service oriented seems to be getting
smaller. From the number of students
that we have, there appears to me to
be a very low level of social concern.”’

‘Again there are glaring excep-
tions”, said Epes, ‘‘Crop, the YS™A,
several projects of the clubs and
fraternities this concern and
to their credit. But with issues the
trend is such that if a big one comes
along, people will work dilligently..for
a couple of weeks.”

In responding to the question of
student involvement Terry stated,
“It wanes and flows. This election we
had the largest number run for
hearing committee. To me that show-
ed that people want to be involved,
but they don’t feel they can afford the
time.”’

Shi also commented, ‘‘I have been
impressed with the energy and dedi-
cation of those students who are
involved in service organizations such
as the ‘‘Y’’. The participation is
sincere and genuinely concerned with
outreach to those less fortunate but I
wonder if the numbers have dwindled
in the past 10 years.”

Right now whatever lack of in-
terest there may be is a function of
two things,” added Rhodes, ‘‘of the
intense pressure for grades which
students feel they have to make and
the sense of quietism and interna-
lized, soul-searching attitudes which
makes students not quite as outgoing
as one would suspect.”

In response to the complaints of
pressure, Will Terry, four years ago
brought a man from Harvard to sbe
about this préssire. As Terry ex-
plained, ‘‘He maintained that he did
find a good bit of pressure here but
that an awful lot came from the
students themeselves--internalized
pressure.

Shi concluded, ‘‘In a way, we as
individuals have become prisoners to
pressures that we as a society have
created for ourselves.”

Grade inflation: Do we compare?

By KIM KEPCHAR

Staff Writer :

Despite campus rumors which at-
tribute to Davidson a lower grade
point average than other shcools and
an exemption from the effects of
ade inflation, a check

rable schools tends to dispel these
reports. Although the climb of grade
averages has not been stopped since
the flurry of coverage after the
itgwan State report of 1974; it seems
that the climb has slowed and in some
cases stopped or reversed.

At Duke University, the assistant
registrar explained ‘‘We_have experi-
enced grade inflation as have most
colleges and universities.’’ Although
specific figures were not available, he
noted that grades at Duke rose until
three semesters ago when they reach-

ed a plateau. He also said that they
experienced a slight decrese in the

average last term, and that the
average now is about a B.

At UNC-CH, Robert Cornwell of
the records department said that the

grade point average ‘‘is not used to
any great extent’’ as an instrument in
itself. However, he noted that a
recent faculty committee made sever-

al suggestions in light of grade
inflation. There was a redefinition of
what “‘A’’ means, and a change in the
policy shortening the period in which

a full student could drop a course
without penalty. -

Williams College, which also felt
grade inflation during the late 1960’s

At Dartmouth, where 60 per cent of
the class of 1976 graduated with
honors (summa, magna, or cum
laude) steps have been taken to
combat grade inflation. Notices con-
cerning inflation have been sent to
professors, and honors will be a-
warded on a percentage basis, work-
ing down to 35 per cent by the class of
1979.

Vanderbilt has also continued to
have slight increases in the average of
all undergraduate grades. Although
they are ‘‘watching it very closely,”
they have not had any centralized
efforts to counteract it, although
possibly certain departments are
working on it

In the following graph are figures
for grade point averages at six
schools, including Davidson. As
many of the schools which supplied
the figures stressed, there are so
many factors relative to the different
schools that too literal a reading is
unadvisable.
