Academically...

The recent poll of faculty opinion (see
Open Forum) presents some rather in-
teresting comparisons. It is worthy of
note that 82°> of the faculty partici-
pated in this evaluative endeavor, which
is somewhat indicative of their interest
and concern in these matters. Figures. of
course, are not finite in themselves, nor
can there be any definitive evaluation
of college academic rating. But the pre-
sent faculty compose perhaps the most
competent board of judges available to
us

A large majority (83.6%) rated Da-
vidson in the top 5% among liberal arts
colleges in the South, which level seems
to be consistent with normal expecta-
tions. Notice that in the United States,
Davidson is only ranked, in the upper
25° of the liberal arts colleges by 38.6%
and in the upper 15% by. 36.3% of those
taking the poll. Some (18.3%) ranked
Davidson in the top 50%.

This can be construed as a critical ap-
praisal of Southern education in light
of its national comparisons. It also serves
as some indication of our national pres-
tige, an evaluative factor often hidden in
the local prominence of ‘The Myth.” The
question inevitably arises—should we con-
sider how we stand as an institution in
relation to colleges other than those in
the South? The answer must be an un-
equivocal yes. There are many obvious
reasons for this position. One is that
more of our graduates are now attending
graduate schools in the North and East.
With subtle but effective erosion of geo-
graphic lines, competition and associa-
tion with other than Southern elements
in our society is an ever growing reality.
Further, Davidson must not limit itself
to the level of Southern educational pro-
gress. Academically, then, we still have
a great challenge before us—to keep
pace. to advance, but never to relax our
educational endeavors.

Another interesting and somewhat re-
vealing facet of the opinion returns is
the faculty vote on enrollment. It is logi-
cally correct to assume that the 12%
who voted to reduce our present enroll-
ment would not wish any further raise in
present limits. Adding this figure to the
58% who desire present population we
have 70% voting against any further in-
crease in student body enrollment. This
is certainly a strong majority, contrary
to recently established college policy, and
contrary to rumored faculty represen-
tation. It is but another very clear indi-
cation that the college community is
against further increase at the present
time—a fact which ought not to be taken
lightly.

To the Voters

Previewing the avalance of nominations,
the “Hey” boys, “Circle One” slips, and
charming platitudes that highlight the
election season, it is healthy for us to
consider a few guide posts of our system.

First, every student must vote. It is
an obligation and duty to student govern-
ment and its elective offices, to the school,
and to yourselves to vote and to vote
intelligently. Your failure to participate
is detrimental to the system and the pri-
ciples for which it stands.

Elections here should not be popularity
contests, regardless of former concep-
tions or senior witticisms. Elective offices
by their nature and by their present re-
sponsibilities are demanding proof that
capable and interested men are needed.
In order to vote wisely and effectively,
you must study the candidate, his as-
sets and liabilities. Examine his experi-
ence in the field for which he seeks
office—how much time has he spent in
that activity, how would he handle the
office? Examine his interests—is he tho-
roughly interested in working after elec-
tion, does he have the interests of the

students and of Davidson foremost?
Examine his opinions and views on is-
sues of vital importance to the college
and student body—where does’ he stand
on segregation. enrollment, academic im-
provement, student opinion. etc.?—for
his views now will be his actions of to-
morrow. Examine his platform and his
proposed plans for the betterment of
his selected office in light of their singu-
lar and comparative value. Finally,
examine his capabilities of performance
and execution of duty.

The student body is sufficiently small
to enable thorough knowledge of its can-
didates for office. It is the voter's re-
sponsibility to ask questions—it is the
candidates obligation to answer them.
Failure of either may result in failure
of both. This is student government. It
rests entirely in studen‘. control, having
great potentialities for failure or for suc-
cess. It is your decision—judge wisely
for your vote will be tomorrow’s leader-

ship.

History Repeats?

The virtual impasse that has resulted
from the South's unwillingness to accept
the Supreme Court’s ruling on the inte-
gration of public schools is reminiscent
of events of the middle decades of the
nineteenth century.

Then as now, institutions were on trial.
Then it was the question of. the perpetua-
tion of slavery; now it is the perpetuation
of segregation. Basically the problem was
the same; What is to be the social rela-
tionship between the races? The emanci-
pation of the slaves did not solve the
problem. Rather it made it more intense,
and segregation was the South's “solu-
tion,” a solution which stopped the gap
for almost a century.

Constitutionally, the point in question
seems to have changed little over the
years. Much’ of the South still believes,
rightly or wrongly, that state sovereignty
is prior to federal power. and insists on
the right of the state to interpose its ori-
ginal sovereignty to stay the action of
the federal government whenever neces-
sary.

The current interposition theory. dif-
fers little from Calhoun’s nullification
theory, which was indecisively tested in
the tariff controversy of 1832. The pro-
blem then as now was what.is to be done
when a portion of the nation refuses to
obey a national law. President Jackson
acted promptly by calling for and getting
a bill authorizing the use of. the mili-
tary in collecting tariffs. The necessity
for action was removed: when the of-
fending tariff was modified to the satis-
faction of South Carolina. The Force Bill
was then itself nullified and both parties
claimed a victory.

The split in the Union came not over
the tariff, but over alleged interference
with state institutions, which is much the
same argument as that used today. Ironi-
cally, in 1860 it was the South which was
upheld hy the Supreme Court, while the
Republican North was very much dis-
satisfied with the Dred Scott decision.

The problem remains. At the moment,
it is doubtful that we are living in the
days of another impending crisis, al-
though to many the conflict does in-
deed -eem irrepressible. But this is not
the time for rash action by either side.
Many states and communities. especially
the border ones, have complied with the
Court’s rulings, and there is growing
conviction in religious circles that segre-
gation is not morally justifiable. On the
other hand, it cannot be denied that
racial relations have been set back in
many other places. Tuscaloosa is only
one example.

The problem obviously will not be
solved overnight. It will require many
difficult years for the South to accept
the Court’s ruling, but such acceptance
will come. Whether it will come with
bayonets or peacefully depends on the
moderation shown by all elements in our
country. William Faulkner’s advice to
would be hasty elements is good: ‘Wait,
wait now, stop and consider first."—

Academic Evaluation by Department Chairmen Begins

The Davidsonian, reflecting the
mounting interest among members
of the student body concerning the
work being done in various depart-
ments of the College and how Da-
vidson compares with other simi-
lar liberal arts colleges, has sub-
mitted five pertinent questions to
the chairman of each of Davidson's
twenty-seven departments.

The answers to these questions
offer a basis for.an analysis of the
progress of the departments over
the past three years, together with
suggestion of the changes that
may be forthcoming. The result is
a partial evaluation of the Depart-
ments of Davidson College.

Questions A and B. of the study
were to be regarded as “tone”
questions. and were to be answered
optionally if time permitted. The
answers received to these lwo
questions are omitted here. but
they will probably be presented
shortly through alumni publica-

tions and a later feature article in
the Davidsonian.

This is the first of a series of
four articles in which we hope to
offer the statements of all of the
Department Chairmen. The follow-
ing answers are copied verbatim
from their reports. The Davidson-
ian is indebted to the Department
Chairmen for their interest and
support.

The “tone” questions were as
follows:

_ A. If you were to persuade an
excellent high schoo! student to
send in an application for admis-
sion to Davidson, what general ar-
gnments would you be inclined to
use?

B, If this student were thinking
of majoring in your department,
what argument would you use?

The three basic interrogations
of the questionnaire were the fol-
lowing:

1, What are the changes that

Homogenized Men

(The fotlowing is an article
first published in the January
issue of the Peabody Journal
of Education. Ed.)

One crisp night last November
our Student Council sat discus-
sing the possible sponsorship of an
exchange student from Soviet
Russia for next year. Assent was
general to the point that we ought
to make sure that our candidate
was not biased, and would not use
his year here as an opportunity
to sell Marxism and criticize our
capitalistic culture. 1 did not
assent, nor did
I say anything;
but all during
the discussion I
felt an uneasi-
ness dbout the
tone and the at-

titude of the ,
proceed ings.

morning I no i

NEED FOR EVALUATION

It has been observed that “for
an integrated education... Ameri-
ca has never had the equal of her
little hill-top colleges.” My col-
lege is one.-of these: a small,
church-related institution which
can justifiably be proud of its
reputation and of the record of
its graduates Today the small col-

lege faces economic difficulties in
keeping stride with the univer-
sities in an era of spiraling costs.
More than ever its virtues need to
be advertised and its raison d'etre
proclaimed. And at the same time,
its deficiencies need to be exam-
ined with a view toward constantly
improving the product—which is
good edycation as well as good
economics. Very shortly I shall
become one of those products and
receive the stamp Grade A.B., and
while still immersed in it I want
to venture a few comments on
that process. These are not hos-
tile criticisms, but ones offered
in love from a debtor and an

investor in the value of small col-
lege.

tSOLATION FROM REALITY

The great danger to liberal edu-
cation is that the small college
will make the process too smooth.
My college has a student body
largely homogeneous: most of us
are white, male, Southern, Pro-
testant, and middle to upper-mid-
dite class in our economic back-
grounds, This homegeneity makes
for a kind of hot-house situation,
an isolation from reality and the
real issues of life and from a
majority of the sort of people who
make up America, It results in a
lack of conflict, and a pattern of
conformity that stifles initiative
and inhibits tolerance. We fail
to mature fully because we don't
have to—there are no factors or
people in our environment to con-
front us with ideas and ideals suf-
ficiently different from our own
to force us to examine ours. We
never learn the depth that comes
from a stout defense of what we
believe, or the tolerance that
grows from an encounter with the
good case of the good man on the
other side. Security corrupts as
surely as power, and in our simi-
liarity of backgrounds and_in-
terests we are surely too secure.

CURRICULUM VS.
ENVIRONMENT

Now to be certain, it is diffi-
cult to encourage the non-Pro.-
testant, the non-Southern, the non-
white, the lower income student
to venture into our homogenized
midst. But few of our small col-
leges are making a serious effort
to recruit him. In failing to do so,
they are failing to fulfill half of
their responsibility to the student:
they provide him the curriculum
but not the environment to pre-
pare him adequately to inherit the
problems of the modern world.
And in a commendable and neces-
sary effort to preserve the best
things of our culture, they are al-
so preserving the worst—retaining
the spiritual values of the fathers,
but the prejudices of the fathers
as well. A little diversity encour-
aged among their academic as-
sociates would go far toward pre-
venting the sons from being the
homogenized men of liberal edu-
cation.

partment in the last three
years?

would you like to see made

in your department in the

next few years?

3. Would you comment fur-
ther on the academic stand-
ing of Davidson in relation to
other similar liberal arts
schools as you see it?

These are the answers to ques-
tions 1, 2, and 3, quoted verbatim
from the reports of the Depart-
ment Chairmen:

DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS

Question 1: New Courses:
1. Development of Economic

thought.

2. Senior “Seminar.

3. Economic Theory

Question 2. The department is
actively interested in revising the
departmental honors work. In the
past we have had a number of stu-
dents doing honors work in econo-
mics. We expect to encourage this
in the future.

Question 3. In our judgment the
work at Davidson compares favor-
ably We think our graduates hold
their own in the best universities
with men from other institutions.

DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL
SCIENCE

Question 1. I changed existing
courses substantially upon arrival
in 1955 and plan in 1956-57 to
modify two present two-semester
courses to four  one-semester
courses. We wilt also in the com-

THE

ing year, subject to faculty final
OK, add honors work and a special.
joint seminar.

Question 2. I consider the de-
partment as presently-inadequate
to functions of this type of col-
lege. A number of constituted
steps would be necessary to im-
prove the quality of preparation
in political science for general citi-
zenship needs, and for careers in
law, government, or graduate stu-
dies, To this end, subject to stu-
dent demand and college OK, the
department in the next few years
might: (a) offer additional course
work (National and state govern-
ments, public opinion and propa-
ganda, public administration, in-
ternational law and organization);
(b) increase such qualitative ex-
periences (perhaps with outside fi-
nancial aid from interested foun-
dations) as student participation
in political processes, field trips,
and discussions on campus by out-
side experts; (c) make staff chang-
es; and (d) attain a regular yearly
flow of three Davidson students
per year to the Washington Se-
mester Program at the American
University, Washington, D. C-

Question 3. Davidson is probably
among best of such schools in this
general region of the country,
though probably not the equal, ov-
er-all, of the top liberal arts
schools in the country.

DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED
MATH

Question 1. A course in Descrip-
tive Geometry is to be offered next
year. This course will follow the

Engineering Drawing course and
wil) conform to similar courses of.-
fered in engineering schools.

Question 2. 1 would like to see
the Applied Mathematics depart-
ment expanded both in scope and
in teaching staff.

Question 3. 1 think the quality of
work done at Davidson compares
favorably with work done in simi-
lar liberal arts schools.

DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC

Question 1. A. Credit for music
theory was increased from two
hours to three per semester along
with two theory drill periods per
week.

B. Physical training credit is
now given for participation in the
football band during the football.
season.

C. The past three years have
seen the birth and growth of the
Intercollege Chamber Music Guild,
a successful concerted effort on
the part of the combined Music
Department students and faculties
of Queens, Catawba and Davidson.

Question 2. A. The construction
of a completely new music build-
ing or Fine Arts Center.

B. The establishment of music
scholarship funds to meet the in-
creasing competition from other
schools in attracting the talented
music students.

Question 3. My guess is that Da-
vidson rates high in comparison
with other schools. I am positive
that there is not another all-male
school of comparable size any-
where in the country that = can
boast a better dept. of music.

WEEK'S CORRESPONDENCE

Implications of Segregation
Presentation Analyzed, Criticized

* .. It has always been the habit
of privileged groups to deny the
oppressed classes every opportu-
nity for the cultivation of innate
capacities and then to accuse them
of lacking what they have been
denied the right to acquire.”
Reinhold Niebuhr, Moral Man and
Immoral Society

Since Religious Emphasis Week
of last year many of us have com-
plained that we have been forced
to hear a. one-sided presentation
of the segregation issue. Last week
those people who had. complained
watched Prof. C. K. Brown take
the stage and speak out loud and
clear the things they wanted to
hear.

Prof. Brown, perhaps the logi-
cal man for the speech, reopened
interest in the bi-racial contro-
versy that has languished of late,
and in presenting what he called
the Southern position he gave
heart to students who had resigned
themselves to the bitter lot of
hearing only church leaders and
liberals give their views on the
subject. | believe that even those
who were most shocked by the
things Prof. Brown said should
admit his speech was long over-
due and was most edifying in a
number: of ways.

There are several points of Prof.
Brown's speech I should like to
discuss. I am afraid at several
places he sacrificed historical ac-
curacy for the benefit of his ra-
cial theories. The reader will re-
member that Prof. Brown claimed
almost all recorded history for
the white man. Now, in the event
that the falsity of his statement
is not apparent enough, suffice
it to say that the paper the reader
is holding (if he has continued
this far) was first an invention of
the Chinese, and that the charac-
ters he is reading stem from Asia
and Afriea.

Prof. Brown also made the re-
mark, I believe, that the white
man under the Providence of God
has been commissioned to pro-
pagate Christianity among all
peoples. As a matter of fact the
Western Europeans are compari-
tive newcomers in the apostolic
movement. As late as the fifth
century, Christianity was brought
to the Anglo-Saxons by a swarthy
African, Saint Augustine.

These facts have great signifi-
cance for us today. The heyday
of the European races is but one
of the periods in the long history
of the world. It is not only er-
roneous, but dangersous, to as-
sume that we are a superior race
with a superior culture, and will
forever enjoy the good life that
in many cases we have usurped
at the expense of others.

I want to make it clear that the
historical errors in Prof. Brown's
speech do not concern me nearly
so much as what they spell:

Racialism. Asiatic and African
peoples are today focusing their
attention on America. We can no
longer safely believe that the
South’s jealously guarded local
autonomy can be used in such a
manner that the democratic ideal
which this nation is so strenuously
trying to sell abroad is sullied
at its fountainhead. We are being
watched, and Americans are being
held accountable for the South's
present embarrasing racial policy.
it would be ironic indeed if
we were to alienate Asians
and Africans to the extent
that they would fall to Com-
munism, from which there is
no return, and form the deter-
mining factor against us, so
that we someday would find
ourselves relegated to the se-
perate-but-equal side of the
tracks!

Finally there are a few things
to be said about Prof. Brown's re-
ligious sanction for segregation.
He explained that Christians are
brothers in Christ but in no other
sense. He rejected the idea that

In an endeavor to evaluate Da-
vidson’s place among liberal arts
colleges and to determine faculty
opinion on items important to all
concerned, the Davidsonian dis-
tributed the following poll to all
members of the faculty. Effort
was made to have the poll purely
objective, and no names were
mentioned. Of the questionnaires
going out to the entire faculty,
82 percent were returned.

The results of the poll are both
interesting and enlightening. It is
of interest to note that the per-
sonal viewpoints of the majority
of the faculty members concerning
enrollment are directly opposed to
the ruling of the trustees.

Some of the faculty members
preferred the term “average” for
“adequate” in question two, voting
that there was a change of impli-
cation as the poll was originally
stated. Other results of the ques-
tionnaires are to be discussed in
a forthcoming article.

The Davidsonian wishes to ex-
press its appreciation for the en-
thusiastic response of the faculty
to this poll and to the questions
submitted to the Department
Chairmen.

The three questions, with the

this concept should be _ inter-
preted to mean worldly equality.
Christ did not endorse the strug-
gles of men for prerogative, and
the negro would do well to escape
the materialism with which many
whites are afflicted.

Now, ! am not e@ thelogian,
and | cannot attack Prof.
Brown's interpretation of the
Seriptures per se. But, al-
though the reader mey dis-
agree with me, | see impli-
cations that are certainly to
be criticized, and those impli-
cations again amount to ra-
cialism. .

Can it be that we whites are so
unselfish as to monopolize the
struggle for power in order that
the negro may remain untainted?
Or should we really say that we
are seeking to eliminate a com-
petitor? If anything can be infered
from the scriptural account of
Jesus’ life, the brotherhood of man
is not an ideal which should be ex-
cluded from the realm of prac-
tice.
