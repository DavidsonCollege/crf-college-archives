A Matter Of Principle

STUDENT CONDUCT

1. Davidson students are expected to conduct themselves as gentlemen.
Any student who is guilty of ungentlemanly conduct or whose conduct is
such as to attract unfavorable attention to himself or to Davidson College
may expect disciplinary action. This action may be expulsion, suspension or
some lesser penalty depending on the seriousness of the offense.

4. Use of Alcoholic Beverages. Davidson College is opposed as a matter
of principle to the use of alcoholic beverages by students. A student will
ordinarily be suspended if he is found guilty of drinking, possessing or being
under the influence of an alcoholic beverage while within the town limits of
Davidson or while attending any off-campus event sponsored entirely or in

part by Davidson College.

tudent drinking not covered by the rule stated in the preceding para-
graph may be dealt with under Item 1 of the rules stated under STUDENT

CONDUCT.

One For The Girls

Last week we saw the spirit of
foster motherhood give in a little here
at Davidson. The faculty gave stud-
ents the right to cut classes, up to 25
per cent. at any time they saw fit: In-
the words of President D. Grier Mar-
tin, “the responsibility now rests with
the students.”

What was: significant about this
action was that it stemmed, at least
in part, from student action. Both
THE DAVIDSONIAN and the Student
Council clearly made their positions
known to the faculty and administra-
tion. The faculty action gave testi-
mony that the college does listen ‘to
the opinions of the students and that
these opinions can make a difference.

We suggest that our fair visitors
think about this seriously. Is this the
case at your school? If not, why not?

We would, in fact, like to take
what we consider to be a typical case.
This is the case of the Queen’s drink-
ing rule.

In passing let it be said that we
chose Queen’s because right from the
start officials here (and there) seem
to encourage attitudes of “agape” on
both sides of the fence. So despite
any animalistic references, we think
most Davidson men, except those who
have passed their jewelry off else-
where, do feel a kinship.

The drinking rule, as we under-
stand it, states emphatically that
Queens ladies will not drink and if

The Way We See It

@The Baptists have beaten us to
the punch again. The ROTC Corps at
Wake Forest has announced that a
new position has been created—cadet
chaplain. He will be responsible for
“coordinating all religious ... and
any charitable activities of the cadet
corps.” And he will have an assistant.

“Company-e-e-e Pray! One-Two!”
@Any student who strayed out in
the rain during the week perhaps
noticed the flag plastered to its pole.
Shows we've got more than fair-
weather patriots anyway.

@THE PIONEER, student newspa-
per at Catawba College, is trying a
new twist to get more readers from
other colleges. We have just received
their latest effort. It was perfumed.
Yep, you're right, the editor’s a girl.

@lf you want to take your girl to
the big dance Homecoming looks like
you've got to go formal. For those who
don’t have a tux our-man-under-arms
has a solution.

President
Alternate signers must be

designated and approved in
advance)

they do the minimum punishment

will be suspension.

Let’s examine the logic of this.
Logic that many of us are all too fami-
lar with. First of all, from the ad-
ministrative point of view, there is
something inherently bad about drink-
ing. Moreover. the above rule assumes
that the college girl is less than re-
sponsible when it comes to drinking.

The rule assumes that each and
every girl will rationalize something
like this before she turns in her room-
mate or close friend:

“This is a rule and rules were
meant to be obeyed. Besides she is
doing something that is bad for her
so I will be rendering her a real serv-
ice if I turn her in and she is sus-
pended or exovelled from school.” And
this is only on the altruistic level.

Pragmatically, we have observed
that the rule doesn’t really work. Its
only results are to get someone kick-
ed out of school every once in a while.

We don't pretend to speak from
any height of perfection. We have our
own drinking incongruity which pre-
scribes that twelve are responsible for
850 (see above).

What we find apalling about the
whole situation, as is the case with so
many restrictive rules, is that the
students take little or no collective
action to make their feelings known.

A question occurs to us. Will you
put your faith in the status quo for
the rest of your life too?

Wear your ROTC uniform!

@We couldn’t help noticing in
THE SALEMITE, Salem College’s
newspaper, the editorial which stat-
ed, “Gov Ross Barnett and other of-
ficials of Mississippi can only be ad-
mired...”

It reminded us of another com-
ment by Negro Commedian Dick
Gregory. To paraphrase, “I admire
Ross Barnett and all that, but I sure
wouldn’t want him dating my sister.”

@There’s a sticker in the student
store that’s creating quite a furor. The
cocky subtitle says, “A Davidson Man
Needs No Introduction.”

Obviously meant for _ girls’
schools, we are waiting to see some-
thing like “And Sweetbriar Ladies
Don’t Want One.”

@ After all’s been said and done,
there is one hopeful thing about the
Mississippi chapter.

Perhaps now the black supremist
and communistic propagandists will
forget about Little Rock.

Poll Reveals Opinions
Of Faculty Cut Ruling

BY JEFF WAMPLER
Davidsonien Managing Editor

This past week, THE DAVID-
SONIAN conducted a_ public
opinion poll among a small num-
ber of students concerning the
recent. decision of the faculty
to abolish the holiday clause of
the cut system. Questionnaires
were distributed at random to
17 members of the sophomore.
junior, and senior classes.

The two questions posed were:
(1) Do you plan to cut any
classes before or after holidays?
(2) In view of the fact that the
new cut rule is in effect on a
trial basis, what action do you
think the faculty should take if
a mass exodus occurs, that is,
if a large number of people cut
their classes before and/or
after a holiday?

in answer to the first ques-
tion, five students indicated
that they did not plan to cut
clesses before or after holi-
days; the remaining 12 indi-

cated that they did.

The answers to the second
question fell into three general
groups, with some overlapping.

Seven of those questioned
felt that if a large number of
students cut, the faculty should
‘not take any action. A junior
business major write: ‘1 fail to
see why it should affect the
faculty member very much eith-
er way. The persons hurt are
the students who cut, not their
professors. It seems to me that
the size of his class should not
affect the quality or effective-

ness of his lectures.”

A junior math mejor. dis-
agreed—"If there is a very
large number who cut, it will
have a bad effect on the pro-
fessor.”—but failed to elebor-
ate. All seven emphasized that
the student should definitely
be held responsible for the
material covered in class.

Four students, all juniors,
commented on the possibility of
professors scheduling writs
and/or reviews on the period
immediately before or after a
holiday. Three felt that tests
should not be scheduled on
these days. The fourth, an eco-
nomics major, disagreed: “No
action should be taken immed-
jately; it must be looked at
from the students’ point of view
ie. does it really affect the
grades of those who cut before
holidays? If it does, then pro-
fessors could give reviews be-
fore holidays which the stud-
ents couldn't cut.”

The third general group, num-
bering five students, felt that
some type of cut penalty should
be imposed. Commented a sopho-
more: “If the vacation rule as
ft now stands were removed,
the new cut system would be
worse than the old. This is
really its only advantage. I think
some restriction, such as a
substantial number of cuts as
a penalty, will be needed.” A
senior English major felt that
the faculty should take action
only to the extent of double or
triple cuts.

One reply to the second

question that defied classifica-
tion was that of a senior Eng-
lish major: “If a guy wants to
cut his own throat, let him.”
These are the results. What
significance can be attached to
them?

The fact is that the number
of students polled was small
17). But the questionnaires
were distributed at random. Of
the 17, three were sophomores,
12 juniors, and three seniors.
Their approximate grade aver-
ages ranged from 1.00 to 2.70,
with the average being 1.78.

There were four English ma-
jors, four business majors, four
pre-med majors, two economics
majors, two math majors, and
one major in chemistry.

One fect to be kept in mind
concerning the first question
is thet there are some stud-
ents who have always cut
before or after holidays be-
cause they live at a great dis-
tance from Davidson.

This poll was taken by THE
DAVIDSONIAN solely to feel
the pulse of student reaction to
the new cut rule. The real test
of the faculty’s confidence in
the maturity and responsibility
of the student body will come in
six weeks with the Thanksgiving
holiday.

Whether or not the faculty
will allow the new ruling to
remain a part of the cut sys
tem will depend to a large de-
gree on the attitude of the stud-
ent body as manifested at that
time.

Plan Offers

More Freedom Of Choice

Berea, O. — (1.P.) Required

weekly assembly programs have
been discontinued at Baldwin-
Wallace College. A new system
has been substituted whereby
students will receive one hour
of college credit per year for
attending a variety of out-of-
class academic and cultural
events.
~ During each quarter, stud-
ents will be required to at-
tend ten events, chosen from
at least five of the following
seven broed areas: music,
ert, drama, general humani-
ties, religion, selence, and
social. There will also be two
required essembiies per quer-
ter for the purpose of com-
muniecsting with. the student
body in face-to-face situation
and for traditional and essen-
tial convocations.

Faculty and student represen-
tatives on the committee strong-
ly supported a program which
would make the liberal arts
mind more aware of the cultural
events and opportunities avail-
able on campus and favored the
idea of offering greater freedom
of choice on the part of the
students.

Tucson, Ariz. — (P.) — In-
ter-Fraternity Council scholar-
ship sanctions will go into ef-
fect this year at the University
of Arizona. According to Dr.

men’s average.”

The sanctions apply to fra-
ternities whose grade average
falls below a 3.00. The meas-
ures include a letter written to
the fraternity's national office
notifying them of their local
chapter's scholarship status and
pledging restrictions.

tf restricted, the house will
only be able to pledge men
who were in the upper half of
their high school graduating
class, having a “C” average in
high school, or at least a 3.0
over-all grade average at the

University, or the equivalent
of a 3.0 if they have trans-

ferred. Measures to be taken

for grade everages below 3.0

in subsequent semesters are:

First semester—the frater-
nity will not be allowed to par-
ticipate in such University-spon-
sored events as the Homecoming
ceremonies, Spring Sing, Var-
sity Show, and Greek Week
Olympics.

Second semester—the frater-
nity will lose all social privi-
leges.

Third semester—the frater-
nity will lose intramural privi-
leges and will be placed on
academic probation.

Fourth semester—all activi-
ties except chapter meetings and
internal affairs will be suspend-
ed, including rush privileges
and IFC voting rights.

Fifth semester—the fraterni-
is local charter will be revok-
ed.
