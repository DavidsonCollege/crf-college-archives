THINGS ARE LOOKING UP

Tonight's opener with Catawba gets another athletic
year underway at Davidson College, and from all indica-
tions, it’s going to be an exciting one.

We thought that an overall preview of things to look |
for this year might be appropriate, and we might as well |

inform you from the beginning, things are looking up.

The football team, to put it mildly, is loaded. Dole |
has more experience, more depth, more speed, more’
everything on hand than he’s had in years. Chances for |
a winning season are excellent, and a Homecoming vic-
tory is practically a sure thing.

The basketball team may still be a year or two away,
but you can bet your bottom dollar that Lefty and Com-
pany will be a top contender when the conference tourna-
ment rolls around. The freshman basketballers (and who |
hasn’t seen them walking around campus ducking under
doorways, etc.) may have All-Staters sitting on the bench
and should go undefeated despite a schedule that  in-
cludes Duke, Carolina, and Wake Forest.

The baseball team will be the best in ages since all
but one starter returns from a team that won six confer-
ence games and five of the last six games a year ago.

With only three starters returning, the soccer team
may not better last year’s 8-3 mark, but should hold its
own against a tough schedule.

The track team has Coach Whittle back and that in
itself means a successful season.

As usual, Davidson should shine in the minor sports
such as swimming, wrestling, cross country, golf, and ten- |
nis. One of these to especially watch is tennis. New coach |
Harry Fogleman is renowned for the excellent tennis
players he has turned out.

With the prospects for a good year sportswise — so
prominent, we hope that school suppurt.and spirit will be
evident at all contests.

Dole Confident As

Coxton Directs Attack

Coach Bill Dole took the wraps off the 1961 edition
ot his Davidson College football team tonight at 8 p. m.
in Charlotte’s Memorial Stadium, where the Wildcats ¢ol-

lided with Catawba.

The resurgent ‘Cats, heavily
favored in tonight's opener for
both squads, were expected to
display a surplus of offensive
punch to go along with the
same stingy defensive unit that
was tops in the Southern Con-
ference a year ago.

Optimism is the keynote with

Dole and his staff, who have
been working fervently since
September 1 striving to mold
the potentially powerful ‘Cats
into a solid football team.

COXTON SHINES
Dole’s work has been made a
lot easier though by Benny Cox-

ton, sophomore quarterback des-
tined for stardom at Davidson.
With Coxton on hand, the veter-
an mentor has had fewer head-
aches than a year ago when

quarterback was a problem.
Says Dole of Coxton, “It's
truly uncanny the way that boy
can move a football. Not only
is he an excellent passer, but
a terrific runner. We have
geared our offense this season
to utilize his ability.”
OFFENSIVE TALENT
Teaming up with Coxton,
;some of the best offensive tal-
ent in years is available to
Dole: Included in this talent
are the following:

of which to be proud.
WE'RE IN STYLE

The old saying, ‘Clothes make the man,” must have |
caught on down in the athletic office. Several Davidson |
teams will be sporting new “clothes” this year. |

The football team donned its new headgear tonight
against Catawba. The new helmets are more or less aj
combination suspension and non-suspension helmet. They |
are designed to absorb the blow and yet cut out much of
the head-rattling after effects of the suspension types.

The basketball team will be a uniforms |
in the Wake Forest opener, December 2. The cagers have
both new home and road uniforms, and we're glad to an-
nounce that fans will know what team is playing. David-
son is in block letters across the front of the jerseys.

The road uniforms will be a different color scheme
this year. Instead of red, the uniforms are black with red
letters and numbers, bordered in white.

A FEW PREDICTIONS

The Southern Conference likes to get a head start.
It is the only major conference that gs into full ac-
tion today as every conference member opens its sche-
dule.

We gazed into our crystal ball and saw our brothers
faring as follows: Memphis State over The Citadel, Fur-
man over PC, George Washington over Florida State,
Richmond over West Virginia in the opening loop battle,
VMI over Marshall, and William & Mary over VPI in a
night loop contest at Roanoke.

Frosh Gridders
PrepFor Opener

This year’s freshman football team began taking
shape last week in preparation for the frosh opener here
on September 28 against Chowan Junior College.

graduation gaps left by such
stalwarts as All-American goalie
Claude Finney, AllSouthern
fullback Dick Dalton, and All-
Southern forward Mike Laugh-
lin.

Despite these losses, Cap-
tain Joe Kelly reports, “We've
got a lot of enthusiasm. Team
spirit is better than ever.”

The Wildcats have a_ fair

share of experience and talent
on hand also. Dave Dakin, Frank
Tulloch, and Kelly are the re-
turning starters, and Tom
Green, Greg Winkler, George
Kuyndahl, and Charles Sasser
lettered a year ago.

New Coach Harry Fogleman,
who comes to Davidson from the
University of Cincinnati . and
who will also serve as tennis
coach, has seen his men only

Four Records Set
In Ability Test

Four records were broken in
the annual physical. ability test
for freshmen this year, Dr.
Tom Scott, Athletic Director, |
recently announced.

“This year's freshman class |
has a lot of good athletes ac-|
cording to the results of this)
test,” Dr. Scott said. “Only 25% |
failed it as compared with 33% |
of last year’s class who failed.”

in addition, this year’s frosh
compiled an average score of
343, which betters last year’s
class by 24 points.

The records broken were as
follows: :

Parallel bar dip — old mark,
26 dips; new mark, 41, set by
Pat Fisher.

| ed their finest record (8-3) last he's seen.

“We're going to try to keep
up the tradition of good soc-
cer at Davidson,” says Fogel-
man, “and things look real’
good.”

Other material available to
Fogelman includes five Rich-
ardson scholars and sophomore
standouts Tarby Bryant | and
Fred Schoen.

Season opener for the booters
is October 7 with King College
in Bristol, Tenn. The first match
on home soil is with Carson-
Newman, October 13.

Both Fogelman and Kelly
hope for widespread student
support this year. Fogleman,
notably pleased with local
interest, concluded, “We've
got a good turnout, but one
more man might be just the
man we need.”

One note of interest on the
booters’ schedule is the fact
that North Carolina, always a
powerhouse, will play here Oc-
tober 24. N. C. State is here
November 2, and the ‘Cats
travel to Duke November 13.

Whittle Expects
Good Season From

fensive ends in the conference
| last season, but has been shifted
\to the offensife team in order
to utilize his blocking and re-
ceiving ability.

Jerry Sheffield, senior end,
is a transplanted halfback
whose speed should make him
one of the conference's most
elusive pass receivers.

Alex Gibbs, junior halfback,
‘is a true speedster and a con-
stant breakaway threat.
| Joe Jones, sophomore half-
back, has service ball experi-
ence under his belt so shouldn’t
make sophomore mistakes.

Bob McAllister, senior full-
back, is a real tank up the mid-
dle and his speed has definite-
ly improved.

The interior line looks set and

the following piayers are there
to clear a path for the backs:
Mike Owen (195) and Bill Dole,
Jr. (230), tackles; Russell Walls
(200) and Dave Lovette (215),
guards; and Bruce Usher (175),
center.
