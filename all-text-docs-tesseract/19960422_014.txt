Baseball slides into
conference as 8 seed

By Kevin ZVARGULIS
Staff Writer

Fighting to stay alive in the
Southern Conference playoff hunt,
Davidson taok two of three at VMI
on Apr. 13 and 14, but suffered a
three-game sweep versus second-
place Western Carolina on Satur-

day and Sunday.

The Wildcats nevertheless se-
cured the eighth and final spot in
this weekend’s league tournament
in Charleston, SC, when Furman
swept cellar-dwelling Marshall.

Davidson (14-30, 6-18) will
face top-seed Ga.. Southern 32-8,
17-3) on Thursday morning in the
double-elimination tourney.

After Saturday’s first contést,
a 9-6 Western victory in which Jon
Coulombe (3-6) pitched a com-
plete game for Davidson, giving
up seven earned runs on 12 hits,
the second of the twinbill was sus-
pended due to rain after three-and-
a-half innings, with Western lead-
ing, 3-1.

Trailing 4-2 in the sixth in-
ning in Sunday’s continuation,
lumbering first baseman Brad
Edwards sliced an 0-2 pitch down
the leftfield line for a bases-clear-
ing double, handing the Wildcats a
one-run advantage heading into the
final frame.

But Western sent the game
into extra innings, in which Cata-
mount DH Dave McKay curled a

homerun around the rightfield foul
pole for the 7-5 win. Chris Pollard
(4-8) pitched all eight innings in a
losing. effort.

Western completed the white-
washing with an 11-6 victory,
pounding out 15 hits.

Edwards starred with a
homerun and four RBIs, while
Luke Goodwin contributed with
three hits and three runs. “We
played well this weekend,” said
head coach Dick Cooke, “It’s just
that Western Carolina kept com-
ing at us offensively.”

After a nonleague tuneup on
Tuesday with Winthrop (3:00 at
Wildcat Park), Davidson plays in
Thursday’s conference tournament
opener.

‘Said Gus Quattlebaum, “I
think we can make some noise.”

In nonconference matchups
this week, the Wildcats bettered
Campbell, 13-4, and lost to cross-
town rival UNC-Charlotte, 9-1.

The loss in Charlotte was two-
fold, as pitcher/center fielder Rhett
Ingrick injured his knee in a freak
collision.

He sat out all three games
with Western, and his availability
is questionable for this weekend’s
tournament.

Ingrick (3-3,'5.94 ERA) was
drafted by the Florida Marlins in
last year’s professional draft, and
had tied the school’s season triples
mark of 5 this year.

In addition to Pastel’s cham-

_ pionship, freshman Paul Wulfsburg

was part of one of the most excit-
ing matches of the tournament at
number five singles.

After splitting the first two
sets with Furman’s Brett Damadio,
Wulfsburg led 5-3 in the final set
when he was crippled with severe
legcramps. Wulfsburg stood help-
less on the side of the court as he
received first a point and then a
game penalty for delay of game,
putting himself within one viola-
tion of match default.

But with the cheers and en-
couragement of his teammates,
Wulfsburg positioned himself back
on the court, where he forced a
double fault and ripped three win-
ners, giving Davidson a much
needed victory on the first day of
play.

“T still can’t believe I won,”
Wulfsburg said. “It was a great
way to start the tournament.”

Jeff Tonidandel also finished
third at #6 singles, dropping only
one match to the eventual flight
champion, ETSU's Antonio
Serrante.

Senior co-captain Bill
Mitchemconcluded his career with
a strong showing at #1 doubles
with Pastel, and Eric Bourn and
Theodore Kaplan finished fifth and
sixth in their respective flights.

Kaplan teamed with Judson
Sutherland to earn fifth place at #2
doubles, and Tonidandel and Blake
Clifton finished their season witha
win over VMI at #3 doubles.

Rugby closes

e e e
with big win

The rugby squad closed
their season on Saturday at the
IMAC fields by dominating St.
Andrews on its way to a 36-5
blowout. :

The win upped the Wild-
cats’ final record to an impres-
sive 6-1.

An undermanned St.
Andrews side, bolstered by the
addition of several Davidson
players in the first half, gave
Davidson all it could handle, as
a Hank Ackerman drop kick just
before intermission made it only
3-0, Wildcats.

But Davidson exploded in
the second period. Dave Der-
rick, Thayer Long, John
Spainhour, Warren Buford,
Mike Lassiter, and Ackerman
all scored tries in the high-scor-
ing affair. Matt Burkhardt con-
tributed his strong kicking game.

Davidson alumnus Simon
Priestly’s score accounted for
St. Andrew’s lone points.

Seniors Sean Harvey and
Keith Davis turned in admirable
efforts in their final Davidson
contest.

The season added to Coach
Jeff Frank's string of 24 non-losing
seasons.

“We had an extremely young
team this year,” Frank said. “The
effort that this team put out sheds a
great deal of hope on the upcoming
seasons, our results will only ge
better.” :
