LAST WORD ON
THE AMENDMENTS

VOL. XLII

Bus.-Economics Club/ @

Names Averyt Pres.

The Davidson College Business
and Economics Association recent-
ly terminated its first year of
operation under the leadership of
President Bob Owens and Profes-

sor Fred Morton as faculty adviser. | ,

In reviewing the progress made
this year, Owens emphasized at the
closing meeting the aid and en-
couragement given the association
by the Charlotte Sales Executive
Club.

One of the highlights of the
year was a combined dinner meet-
ing of the two clubs at the Hotel
Charlotte where the Davidson stu-
dents were given a chance to see
at first hand the opportunities of
the business community. With the
tremendous industrial growth of
the South and the concern of in-
dustry for trained leaders, the
possibilities arising from a closer
relationship between the associa-
tion and neighboring industry are
practically unlimited.

Owens also pointed out how the
association was filling a big gap on
the Davidson campus; before its
formation there was no organiza-
tion primarily interested in the
economics and business students.

In the election of next year's
board of directors the following
men were chosen: Gayle Averyt,
Henry Brown, Johnny Buxton,
Corty Cooper, Roy Davis, Stebbins
Ingram, Tommy Lambe, Harley
Smith, Austin Strand, and Bob
Stogner. During a subsequent spe-
cial meeting, the Board elected as
its officers Gayle Averyt, presi-
dent; Stebbins Ingram, vice presi-
dent; Roy Davis, secretary; and
“orty Cooper, treasurer.

Plans for next fall are already
well under way and tentative ar-
rangements call for three programs
before Christmas.

DISPLAY IN LOBBY

Now on display in the lobby of
Chambers Building is the entire

lege Union.

I, R. C. ELECTS

At a business meeting last week

Union the International Relations
Club elected officers for the com-
ing school year.

dent, Kiki Lewis was selected to

chairman, and Gilbert Gragg was

new membership procedures.

Mike York, retiring president,
presided at the session and com-
mented on some of the club's
activities for the year. After dis-
cussion of changing of the meeting
date from Wednesday to another
night, literature pertaining to cur-
rent affairs was distributed.

Best Military Students
Picked At Grand Finale

By TOMMY THOMPSON

In the final parade of the David-
son College Cadet Corps on Tues-
day, May 11, outstanding military
science students were honored.

Heading the awards was the pre-
sentation of the Henry E. Fulcher,
Jr. Memorial Medal, an award
given to the graduating cadet best
exemplifying the principles of good
citizenship. This medal is awarded
by the Davidson Lions Ciub in
honor of 2nd Lt. Henry E. Fulcher,
Jr., a Davidson graduate killed in
World War Il. Cadet Colonel Leroy
M. DeVane, Jr., of Jennings,
Florida, received the award pre-
sented to him by Dr. Henry E.
Fulcher.

The 108th Infantry Division Cup
was ‘given to the company com-
mander of the best company in the
Davidson Cadet Corps. The 108th
Infantry Division awards this
medal, and Lt. Colonel G. W. Craw-
ford, representing Brig. General
Mayfield and the 108th Infantry
Division, presented the award to
Cadet Captain William P. McAl-
ister of Barium Springs, North
Carolina, commanding Company

STUDENTS CHOOSE
THE KINSEY REPORT

Library statistic indicate that the
Davidson College student has ap-
proximately the same literary taste
as the rest of the nation.

The circulation figures for the
year 1053-54 end with the Kinsey
report on the human female at the
head of the optional reading list,
even though the two copies owned
by the Davidson library are kept
on permanent reserve and are not
available except on special request.

The second-best read title indi-
cates a more literary interest:
Ernest Hemingway's “The Old Man
and the Sea.” It is a small book as
is also number three, Armour’s
humorous “It All Started With Co-
lumbus.” The popularity of the
short books is perhaps indicative
of the digest trend of our times.

If the Davidson list differs from
the national list in any significant
respect, it would be in the promi-
nence of books by Carolina authors
on the local list, though all of these
were national best-sellers as well.
Mrs. Elizabeth Coker of Hartsville,
S.C., wrote “India Allen,” James
Street of Chapel Hill wrote “Veivet
Doublet,” and LeGette Blythe of
Huntersville collaborated with Mrs.
Mary Martin Sloop of Crossnore in
writing “Miracle in the Hills.” It
can hardly be said at Davidson
that a prophet is without honor in
his own country.

The most popular titles (exclu-
sive of required reading) are as
follows:

Kinsey: “Sexual Behaviour of the
Human Female.”

Hemingway: “The Old Man and
the Sea.”

Armour: “It All Started With
Columbus.”

Paton: “Too Late the Phalarope.”

Sharpe: “Brain Surgeon.”

Coker: “India Allen.”

Herzog: “Annapurna.”

Michener: “Bridges of Toko-RL”

Street: “Velvet Doublet.” .

Costain: “The Silver Chalice.”

Frank: “Hold Back the Night.”

Blythe and Sloop: “Miracle in
the Hills.”

Morehead Poll: |
Opinion Poll Suggests,

Student Distavor

In order to establish a valid
register of student opinion on im-
portant issues concerning the en-
tire student body and to create
greater interest in them, the
Davidsonian conducted last week
the first in a series of student
opinion polls to be continued next
ear.

The poll this week,

fluence but to record student
opinion. The poll was taken by
ten reporters and obtained the
opinion of 102 students in six
dormitories. The following ques-
tions were asked with the results
given in percentage of the total
polled.

Are you for or against the pro-
posed Crutchfield amendments as
they now stand? For: 24.5%;
Against: 56.9% Of the 569%
against: Are you for or against
modification of the proposed
amendments? For 81.1%; Against:
18.9% (Undecided: 11.7%; Igno-
rant of the amendments: 6.9%).

port of the amendments were: They
are an adequate answer to the re-
cent drinking episode; they will
give the student council more
definite and defined power.

The main reasons given by those
against the amendments but in fa-
vor of modification were: That they
are a step in the right direction
but some definite changes need to
be made; the compulsory signing
of the honor pledge should be
abolished because it is too
stringent; that the honor court
should have more members; that
the forced testimony clause is too
strong and should be amended;
the drinking penalty should be
lightened.

Of those opposed to modifica-
tion two views were expressed: the
present constitution is too out-
dated for amending and should be
abolished and a new one created;
the present system is satisfactory.

A feeling of general indifference
was expressed by those who are
undecided.

This pol} was taken by reporters
T. Warlick (East), John Hiers
(West), J. Brooks (East), T. Thomp-
son (Carolina Inn), J. Trawick
(Georgia) M. Crouse (Watts), H.
Antrim (Rumple), S. Miller
(Georgia), T. Griffin (Watts), J.
Bourroughs (West).

By Lowly Seniors

faculty and the seniors which was

the seniors. The invincible golf
