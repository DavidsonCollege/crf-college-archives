Davidson trips at end,
falls to Central Florida

By CARTER PAYNE and
JOHN BURNS

The streak continues... the
Wildcats lost their eighth
straight game Monday night to
Central Florida in a_heart-
breaker: 53-51.

After shooting 42 percent in
the first half the Cats led 27-26.
Central Florida controlled the
inside game in the half, as evi-
denced by Ken Leeks’ (no. 44)
two thunderous first half
dunks.

Paul Denmond once again
played well for the Wildcats,
leading the team with 17
points, scoring 10 of those in
the second half and two three-
pointers. But Denmond was
the only player in double fig-
ures. Darry Strickland was.the
next leading scorer with eight
points, six in the second half.

With 15 minutes left in the
second half, Davidson started
what would bean 11-3 run that
ended with 11 minutes left and

a 41-32 Wildcat lead. From this
point on; Central Florida re-
mained in the game with blaz-
ing three-pointshooting, even-
tually cutting the deficit to one
with one minute left. .That’s
when the excitement really
started.

Davidson brought the ball
down court and wasted the
clock until 38 seconds showed
when Denmond’s errant pass
was intercepted by a Central
Florida player. CFU converted
on a six-foot baseline jumper
with 20 seconds left to go up52-
51.

The Wildcats threw the ball
in and got it to Denmond, who
took a three-pointer that
bounded off the front of the
rim into the waiting hands of a
Central Florida player.
Davidson. had to foul three
time in order to get into the
bonus. The process took the
clock all the way down to nine
seconds.

Central Florida’s shooter
choked under the shock of
hearing the Davidson crowd
for the first time all night and
missed the shot. The ball
bounced towards three
Davidson players, who missed
the ball. Central Florida’s point
guard came up with the re-
bound and was fouled with
three seconds left in the game.

The player hit the first shot.
Jay Schmitt grabbed the errant
second shot and let loose a
three-quarter court heave that
missed entirely. Final score:
Central Florida 53, Davidson
51.

Davidson next moves into a
fairly hard stretch of games as
they travel to UNC-Wilming-
ton, have Winthrop at home,
and then go to face an excellent
Appalachian State team in
Boone on the 22nd. Before re-
turning home to play Wofford,
the ‘Cats face South Carolina in

How I lived a little over break (gasp!)

By MARK D. PUCKETT

1) Walking into the house on
that first day of Christmas
break, I entered the kitchen—
bags in hand—and looked
around until my eyes located
and zoomed in on a plate of
brownies, caramel oozing from
the center of each one.
After throwing down my bags

and rushing to the table, I rav-

enously inhaled two. I chose a
third, caressed it, lifted it tomy

mouth, halted my action be-
cause something was amiss,
ran to the microwave, popped
it in for 15 seconds, ran to the

' fridge, poured myself a glass of

cold milk, ran back to the mi-
crowave, removed the
brownie, and ate it standing
there at the kitchen sink in
chewy rapture, gulping a swal-
low of milk after every bite. . . .

2) I drank a beer with my
brother because I told him that

I didn’t drink and he punched
me in the arm and said, “Aw,
come on, have a beer with your
brother.”

3) I then.ate three pieces of
caramel cake made by my
grandmother. It is a cardinal
sin to refuse caramel cake
made by a grandmother.

4) I ate some meat because
my family said I need the pro-
tein since they thought I looked
a little pale.

But, amid all of this holiday
frivolity, I never overate and I
still exercised regularly—and
you can do the same. Every-
body needs to break down
every once in awhile and in-
dulge, just as long as it doesn’t
become a regular thing. Got it?

Also, in case you haven't
noticed, I’ve adopted a new
“nicer” approach to you be-
cause. if it weren’t for you

awake readers I wouldn’t be
here. Besides, I showed some of
my columns to Mom and Dad
and they said that I should
“tone it down, son.”

. Therefore, to all the over-
indulgent porcine sows and
cows that I insulted before, I
take it all back. And to all the
walking beer guts that I had no
right to affront, | apologize. Itis
a new year and I have a new
attitude.
