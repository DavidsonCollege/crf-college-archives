A Wise Move

The trustee decision to abolish com-
pulsory ROTC deserves praise. It has
shown an openness and responsiveness
in the board that, frankly. many stu-
dents did not see there. By reopen-
ing a previously closed case, recon-
sidering the information in the light
of changing times and changing im-
plications. and finally, reversing their
decision of last year, they have shown
a commendable willingness to deal
with the problems of the college in
the present tense.

The decision itself, though, could
hardly be avoided. For those who had
argued that ROTC must remain com-

A Drop Of Mercy

Although it is indeed difficult to
accomplish things on the Davidson
campus, the Residetice Hall Council
has managed to come through with
several minor improvements that do
help to ameliorate the slummish liv-
ing conditions here.

One recent bit of mercy was the
restoration of temporary parking
spaces behind Watts and Little after
some heartless maintenance depart-
ment personnel closed off the area.

‘And tomorrow's planned meal —
free, yet — on an off weekend is
welcome. ,

These and other improvements,
which include the advice that the
RHC is offering for planned dorm
renovation this summer, are accom-
plishments worth a vote of thanks
from the college.

pulsory to exist Dr. Sandy McKelway
answered the question Thursday night
with some of the evidence faculty
members had gathered. The faculty’s
evidence, he said, showed “rather
conclusively” that ROTC would con-
tinue to stick around.

The ethical argument was telling
in Thursday night's discussion. Time
after time, the question came back
to whether it was right to force some-
one else to accept military training
against his will, even with his parents’
consent. And the trustees rightly de-
cided that it wasn’t.

And the junior who said all stu
dents are too immature to be per-
;mitted to decide for themselves? It
is these same 18-year-olds that can
be trusted with jobs on which other
lives depend in Vietnam. As another
student made clear, for all that par-
ents and freshmen know about ROTC
before they arrive, they might as
well flip a coin as to whether to en-
roll. The lack of information was en-
forced immaturity for both parents
and freshmen.

Thus, the trustees followed the
weight of the evidence and decided
the case in accordance with the facts
and the purpose of the college. If
the openness and responsiveness con-
tinues, it may be a new era for Da-
vidson, especially as commission re-
ports come in and the Academy for
Educational Development reports its
findings. The trustees have done
their job well. We look forward to
the next few years with expectation.

Don't Forget To Leap

As the commissions conclude their
studies and the Academy for Educa-
tional Development readies its report,
it is worthy of note that this is the
college’s third try at reforming itself.

First was the self-study report of
several years ago. The recommenda-
tions of the report were numerous, but’
the visiting committee. from David-
son's accrediting agency was unhap-
pily accurate when it termed the
recommendations dull and unimagina-
tive.

So the school tried again with the
Blue Sky program. That too has been
more myth than reality so far. The
program was adopted in its entirety
except for two parts, the two which
offered some measure of real reform
but were controversial: voluntary
ROTC and abolition of fraternities.

The Honors College will be restrict-
ed to a few top-notch scholars, but
good grades don’t mean a person gets
educated. What of the other students
who come here? They get left on the
outside as a selected few get David-
son's best. Non-Western studies of-
fers no.major, and thus reasserts the
“natural superiority” of the Western
Way of Life. The much-talked-about
area exams and 3-3-2 program have
turned out to be just the old system
under the new name, where course

WILSON ON REFORM

“The American college must
become saturated in the same
sympathies as the common
people. The colleges of this
country must be reconstruct-
ed from the top to the bot-
tom. The American _ people
will tolerate nothing that sa-
vours of exclusiveness ... .
The people are tired of pre-
tense, and f ask you... . to
heed what is going on.”

credits replace semester hours.

One AED representative who was
here recently talked in terms of a
quantum jump. He said Davidson had
been gradually improving for a long
time, but that at some point it would
have to jump a fence, so to speak,
and get on the other side.

He was right. If Davidson doesn’t
do it on the third try, energy for the
fourth may not be there.

The move must be made,’ and it
must be effective. It cannot be the
half-hearted and half-way efforts of
the past. Davidson has looked long
enough. The time has come to leap.

Beyond Usefulness

What used to be reasonable safe-
guard against abuse of need scholar
ships has now become an injustice
and a subtle form of social discrimi-
nation: the cars and scholarships rule.

The rule forbids any student on a
scholarship granted on the basis of
need to have a car on campus for
more than three days at a time.

The reasoning has been that a stu-
dent who was poor enough to need a
scholarship was too poor to have a
car.

But now the car has become a vir-
tual necessity in a technological so-

For Consistency

A minor item in the proposed in-
crease in student fees for next year
which has drawn little attention is
the $45 increase in the cost of a sin-
gle room.

Such a minor increase is really
nothing to raise a big fuss over. After
all, it has long been understood that
it costs much more to maintain a
single room than a double room or
suite. ; ;

And in the case of the janitors, it
is quite logical that it requires mure
work (and therefore better pay) to
empty one waste paper basket than
to pick up two at a time.

What it does suggest, however, is
that the rising cost (now $75 more per
year than a double room) is making
the single room a luxury. ;

Let the Committee on Admissions
and Financial Aid take notice.

It is only fair that those students
holding single rooms on campus not
be allowed to receive need scholar-
ships.

ciety, just as electric lights in dormi-
tories. Because of this, the meaning
of having a car has changed, and it
is no more undesirable for a student
to have a car on campus than ‘it is
for him to have an electric typewriter.

Lack of cars also adds to the iso-
lation of students already stuck 25
miles out in the backwoods of North
Carolina. Since one of the justifica-
tions of required assemblies was the
bringing in of outside speakers, it
seems contradictory to restrict the
students’ means of returning to the
outside world.

Also to be considered is the matter
of the fraternity-independent distinc-
tion. When a person is in a fraternity,
transportation becomes much less of
a problem than when a person is an
independent. To begin with, it is just
easier to get a ride from within a
fairly cohesive group.

But then, what sort of time can
someone have if he is restricted to
nothing but double-dating?

However, the worst problem with
the car and scholarship. rule is the
possibility of what would happen if the
admissions office ever applied the
principle with any consistency.

Students would find themselves
limited to $5.28 on dates a month,
unless of course their dates. paid the
cost. Overeating would be forbidden,
and scholarship students would re-
ceive ration cards. Refrigerators, tele-
visions and record players would be
contraband for scholarship students
because someone who was so needy
as to require a scholarship shouldn't
have these.

The parody of the rule could con-
tinue, but the point is made. The rule
has outlived its usefulness, and needs
to be repealed.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Newspaper, ROTC Are

Compulsory--Buchanan

To The Editor:

THE DAVIDSONIAN’s con-
tinued blasts at ‘our ROTC
program have finally hit
home.

Now that I realize and fully
understand the ethical impli-
cations of the question, I am
enthusiastic about ridding all
features of Davidson life
from morally compromising
situations.

After all we do wish to ex-
perience the ‘‘real world.”

One particularly galling sit-
uation which has heretofore
been overlooked is that we
students are forced to sup-
port the student newspaper.

Although one. of its de-
fenders told me that the pa-
per was not an onerous nor
nefarious thing, I fear that
he was ignoring the moral
implications.

A more just policy. and
one more in line with our
moral perspective. would be
voluntary student support for
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

-But I am sure that even
this ideal scheme would mect
with some opposition. Paper
supporters would maintain
that the paper could not sur-
vive on this basis.

THE DAVIDSONIAN needs
the funds from all student in
order for those students who
wish to take advantage of
the paper to do so.

Well, if the paper cannot -

justify itself by itself. then

it has no place on this can-
pus.

If we find it uncomfortable
to have on campus the same
institution which has brought
us Dwight Eisenhower, the
Korean war, et. al... then
think how inconsistant it is
to force support for the
breeding ground of future

ED NOTE: This letter is a
reply to THE DAVIDSONIAN
editorial of March 28, “ROTC
Has To Go.”

My position. lest anyone
imagine me unnaturally bel-
ligerent or accuse me of hav-
ing ulterior motives, is I am
enrolled in advanced ROTC—
for purely pragmatic rea-
sons; I would not be in ROTC
today had the course been
voluntary; I am opposed to
the war in Vietnam and con-
cerned about the military -
industrial - educational com-
plex in the United States.

My argument, and | must
be amused by THE DAVID-
SONIAN’s sudden concern

at anf

sibly be.

The main point of argu-
ments for a voluntary pro-
gram has been that fresh-
men in college are mature
enough to decide for them-
selves the value of ROTC.

On this point I disagree.

If their reasons for not en-
rolling in the program are
valid, then parental approval
of their actions would follow.

As to the degree of matur-
ity of mos students, why
dees THE DAVIDSONIAN
find it necessary scold cer-
tain elements of the student
body for having and enjoy-
ing activities such as scav-
enger hunts and = general
brawls?

I genuinely feel that the
need to maintain the ROTC
program on campus is vital.
It would be a mistake to
jeopardize the program as
a result of the idealistic and
inconsistent arguments of
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

with teuth, is with the paper’s
assumption that ROTC is in-
compatible with a liberal arts
education that ‘trains stu-
dents in the pursuit of truth.’

I consider the essence of a
liberal arts education to be
the presentation of as many
facets of human experience
as possible.

If anything ‘‘trains students
in the pursuit of truth,” it
is showing them that because
life is so varied and complex
there are no, or very few,
absolute truths.

ironic that two of the things

son have been ardently cam-
paigning are the abolition of

Jones Knocks Area Exams

To The Editor:

I too almost fell off my
chair when I heard Robert
Bryan speak for the first
time on national TV — but
from sheer delight, not from
the sort of fury evinced by
Taylor Adams. (DAVID.-
SONIAN, April 11).

Captain Bryan, like all
good Southerners, is a con-
summate actor and puton
artist, and his sense of style
makes a usually drab pro-
gram really sparkle for a
change.

The Robert Bryan charac-
ter is now known to some
60 million viewers. The fact
that he projects this charac-
ter with only a few lines
each program is, I think, a
notable and praiseworthy
achievement.

The bit about “riding to
the hounds" was a vertitable
coup de maitre. I can picture
him chuckling to himself with
glee as the molasses - like
tones of this roll across the
country and set the teeth of
thousands of humorless,

short - sighted Yankees on
edge.

To pseudo - reconstructed
Southerners like Taylor
Adams I say pooh-pooh.

In his Spartan program of
self-betterment, he seems to
have lost his sense of humor
along with his Southern ac-
cent.

To The Editor:

Although my acquaintance
with Blue Sky at present ex-
tends only to the Midi, I will
take exception to your edi-
torial on area exams (THE
DAVIDSONIAN, April 11)
asserting that ‘‘no student
should go through a liberal
arts education’ without en-
countering Sartre, counter.
point or the ‘“‘cold eye’’ of
Yeats, among other things.

I cannot accept the idea
that there is a list of sub-
jects that should constitute
anyone's education,

You recugnize value in ‘‘ex-
citing the enthusiasm of the

students and giving them a
chance to explore.”’

I sense a_ contradiction,
somewhere.

Reflecting on my ‘‘educa-
tion’’ thus far, what I have
learned is directly propor-
tional to the extent that my
interest coincided with what
I did.

Not surprisingly, such was
greatest when I had the most
choice in what I was doing.

If the development of abili-
ty in communication and of
critical capability are more
important than acquaintance
with Yeats or Sartre (or
Lycophron or Vico), perhaps
the students could satisfac-
torily choose worthwhile sub-
jects for themselves, es-
peciali, if each student has
a personal adviser (who
might better be chosen by
the student than assigned) as
you suggest.

My implicit assumption, of
course, ‘s that most students
have parti..'sr interests.

LATE AEE

‘Police Power’

Recently in the mass media there has been a
great deal of criticism of those tried and true defen-
ders of the American Way, the police. Obviously, the
police have gotten the worst of the argument and your
columnist feels it is time some patriofic soul stepped
forward and came to their defense. However, it is

not going to be me.

Contrary to communist propaganda, the typical
American policeman is not a blundering, sadistic clod.
He is really genial, intelligent, decisive and shrewd.

There is a story now going around campus that
illustrates the perspicacity of the men in blue of our
neighboring community of Mooresville. Recently one
of Mooresville’s finest stopped a carload of students
passing through late at night and asked each of them
where they were from and where they were going.

One of the students, a Richardson Scholar, re-
sponded that he was from, let us say, Poland. “Oh
yeah, wise guy?” the cop replied. “Name me a town

in Poland.”

With such shrewed detective ability as this it
is easy to see why the Mooresville police are renowned

far and wide.

Police in other urban centers across our nation
are similarly analytical..They stock up on riot con-
trol weapons, and feeling the need to get a little
realistic tactical training with them once in a while,
they clear the streets of the two major criminal ele-
ments in our society, students and Negroes. This is
known as “Law and Order.”

However, they have shown little desire to deal
with some of the more aggressive elements of the
underworld, e.g., the Mafia, which is probably one of
America’s largest industries and is still growing. In all
too many cases the degree of law and order seems
inversely proportional to the amount of the payoff.

Leaving out fuzz of the Bull Connor stripe as
being too unbelievable to deal with, the police seem
to have shown a remarkable ability to antagonize
even law-abiding moderates on occasion, thus earn-

ing the appelation “pigs.”

If there was one conservative reporter tagging
along in a civil rights march, he would get maced.
Onlookers at Duke were chased across campus and

tear gassed in the chapel.

The anti-ROTC campaign at Harvard was doomed

to failure until the a

nistration called in the police

to attack the demonstrators and 8,000 moderate
‘students moved several degrees to the left after the

sickening spectacle.

The problem of the police is the problem of an
affluent society that has underpaid too many unquali-
fied men to do a difficult job. It is a job with little
prestige and few rewards. But many of the men who
hold it deserve few rewards.

The Hydra-headed monster of the police mentali-
ty cannot be eradicated in a decade, but it must be
eradicated in a generation. Law enforcement is too
important to be left up to the police.

Reader Defends ROTC

subsidized athtetics and com-
pulsory ROTC—moves which
would reduce the number of
elliptical people at Davidson
~—while at the same time
they have been calling, right-
ly,.for more diversity within
the college community.

Not only would these
changes deplete two signifi-
cant sub-cultures at David-
son, the jocks and the ROTC-
jocks, they would also shrink
the ROTC and physical edu-
cation department probably
the most heterogeneous de-
partments at Davidson.

It is a fact, however un-
fortunate it may be, that the
military forms a large part
of American society—indeed,
of international society—and

‘knowledge of its workings

can be an important contri-
bution to a iiberal arts edu-
cation.

Granting this, one stilt
must acknowledge that ROTC
does not have the intellectual
scope offered by other dis-
ciplines.

if on this basis (i. e., to
make ROTC. equivalent. to
the other crip courses, which,

as far as | recall, are all
electives) if is decided to
make ROTC voluntary, then
1 will wholeheartedly concur.

I do not believe. however,
that because of the nature of
the subject ROTC should be
made voluntary.

I can envision a course cov.
ering the works of Clause-
witz, Kuhne, Foch, Saxe and
Guibert, and emphasizing the
theory and philosophy of war-
fare, which would be as stim-
ulating as any other course
Davidson offers.

The practical  side.drill,
rifle cieaning, etc.—would be
no less a contribution to the
liberal arts than the science
labs.

The best argument { can
offer for the retention of
ROTC at Davidson is sum-
med up in a comment made
by the dean of Wharton: “tn
the Army you don’t learn a
great deal about business,
but you learn a lot about peo-
ple.”

If learning about people
isn't the activity of a liberal
arts education, what is?

NSA Convention
Plans Draw Fire

To The Editor:

I read with some dismay
that Mr. Peter Hobbie, the
self-styled champion of stu-
dent rights. has decided to
attend the National Congress
of the National Student Asso-
ciation in El Paso this sum-
mer.

This so-called Congress,
better called two weeks paid
vacation, will be on the stu-
dent body’s expense account.

In reaction to such a waste
of money, three years ago
Davidson voted NSA off cam-
pus, and three weeks ago,
the University of North Caro-
lina, a founding member of
this organization 23 years

ago, disaffiliated.

However, the student body
leaders at Carolina, perhaps
a little more wary of student
opinion than Mr. Hobbie,
have returned money formal!-
ly appropriated for their ex-
pense by the student legis-
lature.

Mr. Hobbie. who seems to
claim to know the student
body’s will better than they
themselves, seems to be un-
willing to allow formalities
like student body referenda
and Senate appropriations to
stand in his way
