Honesty, Despite Dis

The honest air that surrounds the
new head coach follows him as he hits
the long and weary trail that leads to
the superstars of tomorrow.

There were two other important
things that Brickels wanted to say
about recruiting. The first deals with
the standards that are present at
Davidson, which have been referred
to on numerous occasions as disad-
vantageous to the recruiting efforts of
coaches.

“Actually the standards are a help
to the program and it benefits from
them,”’ stated Brickels. ‘‘We can sell
the school because it is a good, solid

academic institution. There are many
smart basketball players and we just
have to get them.”’

The second thing that Brickels is
concerned about with regard to the
recruiting predicament is the anxiety
that most people have over the Cats’
lack of a “‘big man.”

“I really do not believe that bit
about us being a great team if we just
had a big man,”’ contended the new
head coach. ‘People are always
saying they are waiting for us to sign
the bigman.

‘“‘We could have signed a couple of
big men already. But they wold not
have been the players that would have
helped us. They were not that good

here. But I do not think that if we nad
had Tommy Burleson playing for us
that we would have been national
champs. I just do not think that the
big man” issue is that crucial.”

A coach's directness and honesty
with people is definitely an integral
part of the business. That aspect
which Brickels and his staff possess
could be one of the key factors in how
well the team fares, both in recruiting
and in actual game performances.

Brickels concluded with the remin-
der that this is not the most important
year for recruiting; not nearly as

much as the coming year will be. But ~~

he is still confident that some key
people will still sign at Davidson.

Brickels has the confidence in both
his players and his assistants that
they can get the job done. When the
people that have to do the job believe
in themselves, then the job generally
gets done, and usually done well.

And somehow, with his attitude and _

those of his assistants being as they

are, it is just hard to believe that they

will not be able to work the miracles
that seem to become necessary as the

days pass by.

“I think we have had an ex-
cellent recruiting year,” ad-
mitted head tennis coach Jeff
Frank. ‘‘When you consider
all the things that are involved
we have really done well.”

It certainly has been a good
year for the Cats, as they have
signed four of the top six
players they were after, and
still have a fifth hanging on
the line.

The first prospect that
Frank lured to Davidson was
Chip Bondurant, a top player
from Winter Park, Fla.

Stuart Boswell is the third in
the list that Frank has
acquired this recruiting
season.

Boswell was one of the top
three junior players in the
metropolitan area of
Washington, D.C., which is
known for being a_ tough
region as far as tennis com-
petition is concerned.

“He is a super strong player
and we are certainly
delighted that he has chosen to
come to Davidson to play ten-
nis,” Frank pointed out. ‘He
turned down some big scholar-
ship offers from Tulane and
Vanderbilt to come, so we
really think highly of him.”

Boswell is about six feet tall.

These four players were
among the top six that Frank
was concentrating on getting
to come to Davidson. There
are two others, one of which is
going to Virginia (at last
report). The other is deciding
between here and Princeton.
There are several other ten-

Davidson next fall, each of
whom Frank will look at long

his squad for the coming year.
