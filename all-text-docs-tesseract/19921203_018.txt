THE DAVIDSONIAN —

Wa 5
/ THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3,1992

By Chris Hoveland
The opening of the North
Carolina Blumenthal Performing
' Arts Center, which took place
November 21, marks a superb
achievement for Charlotte and the
performing arts. The $46 million
complex includes the Belk Theater
which seats 2,100, the Booth Play-
house which seats 440, as well as
the multi-purpose Studio Theater.
The new Arts Center is lo-
cated in Charlotte’s “Art and En-
tertainment District” (which may
have a new name in the future, if
the City can make up its mind).
Event-goers can find parking in
the NationsBank Corporate Cen-
ter Parking Garage, and take the
“skybridge” into Founders’ Hall.
There they can find entrances into
either Belk Theater or Booth Play-
house. The new facility is handi-
cap accessible.
The “European” horse-shoe
designed Belk Theater is distin-
guished by excellent acoustics,

Center Provides New Opportunities

plush seating, and a fiber optic
lighting system. The farthest seat
from the front of the stage.is only
135 feetaway, which indicates the
intimacy of the design. Kathy
Mattea with Hal Ketchum will per-
form here on December4 , the Char-
lotte Symphony Orchestra on De-
cember 12, and the North Carolina
Dance Theater will perform The
Nutcracker on December 17-20.
(Call the Blumenthal Ticket Of-
fice at372-1000 for more informa-
tion.)

The Booth Playhouse is a sub-
stantially smaller theater which is
ideal for repertory theater,
children’s theater, film, commu-
nity theater, choir, seminars,
emerging dance companies, story-
telling and others. The Oratorio
Singers of Charlotte will perform
J.S. Bach’s Weihnachis Oratorium
(“Christmas Oratorio”) on De-
cember 19, and the Charlotte Rep-
ertory Theater will perform A Man

for All Seasons by Robert Bolt on

December 3-13. The front seats of
the gallery at Booth Playhouse can
be removed to create a cabaret the-
ater or theater-in-the-round.

While the new facility is
widely praised in many circles,
there have been some criticisms.
Forone, Belk Theater has a smaller
capacity than Ovens Auditorium.
The problem arises when a
performer’s agent refuses to lose
the revenue of 500 fewer seats.
Tickets would have to be raised
roughly $10 per ticket to alleviate
this problem, but the Blumenthal
administration will not take this
step. While some claim that the
difference in size will offera greater
variety in performance halls, oth-
ers consider it an esoteric decision
on the part of the designers. Also,
those seated in the back seats of the
orchestra level will not be able to
read the superscripts shown during
an opera because of the overhang
of the second level.

Ultimate Study Break

By Chris Hoveland

Studying Tuesday night?
No? Maybe you need a release
from the stress of upcoming ex-
ams. If that’s the case, you defi-
nitely won’t want to miss the per-
formance of The Percussion
Group at 8:15 p.m. in Hodson
Hall. This unique, energetic en-
semble, formed in 1979, includes
three percussion virtuosos: Allen
Otte, James Culley, and Rusty
Burge. Their performance is guar-
anteed be powerful and lively, and
willcertainly satisfy anyone’scrav-
ing for exciting entertainment.

The Percussion Group is the

Ensemble-in-Residenceat the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati College-Con-
servatory of Music. A special rela-
tionship with many composersover
the years has brought abouta large
body of new and often experimen-
tal music written for, dedicated.to,
or first performed by The Percus-
sionGroup. They have performed
inEuropean, Asianand many North
American concert halls including
Alice Tully Hall, Kennedy Center,
Lincoln Center, and many other
halls and festivals. Davidson is
very fortunate to have these per-
formers — this concert is a must-
see.

Below Grandfather Mountain

sometimes in these hills

a spirit settles in:

thunder’s distance-muted din
or wisps of engine drone
from near the buried sun

a wind-breath, abrupt and chill,

threads the valley, high and creek-carved,
and stories heard and never heard

recall themselves: old Isaacs, his skeleton
perched upright, intact in the cave

its discovered; stock of the long gun

eaten away but powder and primer dry
enough to fire after two decades

a ridge further down-the lights
of Brown Mountain: tales of love beyond the grave

these times are sealed by the sounds

that persist after dusk: the whippoorwill’s
reminders, the creek’s incessancy, hounds
baying-hounds lost or gone wild in these hills.

bugle on hill and through hollow

Dal, or whichever midnight coffee man,
rousing nudges the aged-grimed
pot black on the embers

myth or fox: predetermined winner-
hark to the race, swig with cronies,
cling in heart’s heart to the frosting earth

persimmon weather again and someone you knew,
were, the ghost in the ruined dog trot,
stirs, whispers in the dusk

Persimmon Weather Again
(for Gabe)

“Persimmon weather again,” you wrote,
And listened to ken the echo
of running hounds in a distant hollow.

Out there, in that ruined dog trot,
Stirred the voice of a human howl.
Someone we knew, you said,
“whispering in the dusk.”

Now it is persimmon weather again.
Like cronies roused by the horn,

we gather near turned earth and stone,
listening in the November air.

The cry of someone we knew,

whispers in the dusk.

Poet

Once again, with reservations,
Herman sets his muse a-warbling,
Pines to share his meager rations,
Vows to scorn the critic’s garbling,
Finds (since Pegasus will not fly):

Warble, NOUN-subsurface swelling
Caused by maggots of the botfly.

Garble, VERB-rings less romantic
Than garbanzo, NOUN. (Play, Gypsy!)

Is Garbanzo dashing, antic?
No, alas, he’s just the chick pea.

Impure rhymes and unclear meanings,
Faithless verbs and nouns you look up
-Modern verse and nuclear preenings-
Herman shuts both muse and book up.
