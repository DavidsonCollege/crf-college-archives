Smyth Gets

to Talk

In Vesper Service

Pinned,
The ceremony is military, not romantic, however, as Cadet Ross Smyth receives his pledge rib-
bon from Lawrence Trotti during Scabbard and Blade's spring tapping at Tuesday's drill,

From 1940 to, 1945 he served
with the United States Army, and
was assigned in 1941 and 1942 as
an R.O.T.C. instructor at David-
son. Later he was assigned to the
Army Air Forces with air intelli-
gence and administration. He was
for one and one half years in the
European theater, and was dis-
charged with the rank of major.
