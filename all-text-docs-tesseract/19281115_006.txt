Report For Rifle Team

Manager Long is Arranging
Schedule of Matches With
Other Teams

“In response to an announcement in
chapel on November 4g, relative to the
meeting of the Davidson Rifle Team,
forty-two men turned out, only three
of whom were members of last year's
team, namely: C. P. Gryer, R. D. Rus-
sell, and W. M. Long. Among the re-
cruits were twenty Freshmen and
nineteen Juniors and Sophomores. ~

According to W. M. Long, manager
of the team, only nine matches have
been definitely arranged so far, while
some twenty more are yet to be
scheduled. Those matches already ad-
justed are with the University of Wy- |
oming, Michigan State, Kemper, Uni-
versity of Illinois, Texas A. and M.,
Rutgers, University of Washington,
and the University of Alabama.

The schedule is by ng means com-
plete and several matches including
some shoulder to shoulder competi-
tions are still pending. But it is prob-
able that they can be arranged suc-
cessfully. Among those teams with
which these pendant matches are being

made are the Charlotte Rifle Club, Gas-

tonia Rifle. Club, V. M. I., Citadel,
Wofford, Clemson, N. C, State, and

The Sophs had pretty good team-work

unerring accuracy. Something seemed

DR. HOOD SPEAKS
TO MINISTERIALS

Psychologist Suggests Practical
Application of his Subject

“Practicing what he was preaching,”

Drm Frazer Hood, chair of psychology,
furged the members of the Ministerial
Band to whom he was speaking Sun-
da yafternoon to gain the attention, to
,hold the interest, to fix an impression,
{and to bring about a positive response
of their pastorates.

With a rare and figurative interpre-
tation of the parable of the sower, Dr.
Hood opened his talk, saying that the
minister is a “sower of the seed.” The
soil into which the seed is cast ‘is the
congregation. Part of the soil is pre-
pared, some is unprepared for the seed.
Part wjll bring forth an hundredfoid,
some will produce that which withers
away.

According to Dr. Hood there are
three professions, salesmanship, teach-
ing, and preaching, which require the
gaining and holding of attention, the
fixing of an impression and production
of a response. The secret of gaining
attention is concreteness; of holding
the attention is varying approaches to,
and aspects of, the subject; of fixing
an impression is association of sub-
jects and personal application. Re-
sponse is the result of the first three
steps carried through successfully.

Juniors Win Class
Basketball Series

Juniors Defeat Seniors by Good
Score to Cinch Title

The Juniors cinched the interclass
basketball title last Thursday night
when they beat the Seniors by a score
of 20 to 11, The Juniors had practical-
ly won the title when they beat the
Soph team on the preceding Tuesday
night, but to do the thing up right,
they took the Seniors into camp in
their last game.

Furness Johnston was high-point
man of the game and was the out-
standing star. He looped 13 points,
just to show the customers how it
should be done. Furness evidently be-
lieves in a good beginning and. good
ending, as well as a good intermediate
part. He got twelve points in the first
game of the series. His thirteen points
in this game were enough to<béat the
Seniors if his team-mates thad not put
in a single shot.

Johnston was about the only man on
the floor who got very many baskets.
In fact, the game was marked by ex-
tremely close guarding all the way.
Only one goal was made during the
entire first quarter, McGavoch, Junior
center, looping that. The Seniors
guarded closer in this game than they
have in any of the others, but were in
turn closely guarded had frequently
missed the shots they did get a chance
to try.

With The Other (Colleges

Air De-humidizers

Dickenson College—(CNA)—The pos-
sibility of the development of an air de-
humidizer for silencing over-talkative
souls is being, considered by Prof. E, A.
Vuilleumier, head of the Chemistry de-
partment of Dickinson College, according
to an article in the Dickinson student
paper. :

They quote for authority an article in
an issue of Science by the professor :

“Arizona is perhaps best known in the
demi-lands as the abode of strong, silent
men. So stepped in sentimentality is the
lore of their locanism that a pragmatic in-
terpretation has become imperative.

“The low humidity of Arizona is almost
proverbial as the silenge of her strong
men. For low humidity begets parched
throats and it is axiomatic that a desic-
cated larynx and a vociferous tongue are
incompatible.

“A practical application suggests itself.
Long-winded speakers have been a prob-
lem of not only the Senate but also every
after-dinner meeting in the history of the
country, A.local anesthetic administered
with the aid of a potent air dehumidizer
would be effective.”

The Dickensonian suggests the appli-
cation of this machine to assembly speak-
ers. It could be installed near the speak-
er’s place and turned on when his talk
became. uninteresting and lengthy,

No Shirt-Tail Parade

Washburn College—(CNA)—A threat
to abolish student government at Wash-
burn College, by Dr. Parley P. Womer,
president, has followed student disorders
at a shirt-tail parade and student walkout
a week ago. 2

The student body refused to attend
classes Friday and while out tore down
labor union banners, disrupted classes in
the high school, invaded the girls’ dorm,
and took over the town generally!

“If the student government cannot
handle the students any better than such a
demonstration we will have a
monarchy. Take your choice,” Dr, Wom-
er told them.

They Live Longer

College — (CNA) — A
Haverford graduate has exactly 50 per
cent cent more chance to live longer if he
is a graduate of this school than if he
drops out before he gets his diploma.

Haverford

This was figured out by Royal J. Davis,
editorial writer of the New York Evening

Post, from the alumni directory recently |:

issued by Haverford.

Figures show that 78 per cent of the

1,730 graduates are now living, while only |’

52’ per cent of the non-graduates are liv-
ing.

“What could be better proof of the
evidence of the value of the Haverford
atmosphere,” Davis concluded in his com-
munication to the publicity department.

Undergrad Debts

Yale College—(CNA)—The student
who graduates from college with a debt
hanging over his head is held back at the
outset of his career, Dean Clarence W.
Mendell, of Yale College, declared in ex-
pressing his opposition to the borrowing
of money to defray the expenses of under-
graduates at college.
The Yale educator also expressed his

_| opposition to the system proposed by Dr.

Trevor Arnott at Chicago recently where-
by colleges would be run in a more busi-
nesslike fashion, with consequent higher
costs to students. Dr. Arnett ‘favored the
policy of the students borrowing money to
meet the needs of such high costs to the
student, while Dean Mendell opposed him
in every respect, denying that it is best
for college expenses to be increased.

As to the inadvisability of students go-
ing into debt to pay his way through col-
lege, Dean Mendell added that the student
who does adopt this means of getting
through has the wrong incentive at the
very beginning and instead of building
steadily for the future his energies are
absorbed in an effort to pay off debts
hanging over him.

New Arch Lectur

Butler University—(CNA)—The domi-
nating feature of the new campus- of
Butler University is the fact that all the
offices, class rooms and even laboratories
are housed in one building. There are
54 class rooms, the administration offices,
the college of liberal arts and religion, the
library, science hall, laboratories, domes-
tic sciences and arts, and a botanical con-
servatory which consists of a herbarium
and greenhouse. The building fs of
gothic structure and five other buildings
of the same time are being planned to car-
ry out uniformity on the campus. The
foundations are from 12 to 20 feet thick
and tre walls are three feet thick.

The Weather

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
-(CNA)—Weather forecasting for avia-
tion is included in an advanced course in
meteorology by the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology.

The course, believed by ‘the institute to
bé the first of its Kind in the country, will
be given by Dr. Carl-Gustaf Arvid Ross-
by, a native of Sweden and recently chair-
man of the committee on aeronautical
meterology of the Daniel Guggenheim
fund for promotion of aeronautics.

ABE MARTIN ON THRILLS

i

“The great unsettlin’, disturbin’ factor
in American life t’day is th’ insistent an’
growin’ thirst for thrills,” declares Abe
Martin in the December College Humor.
“Women especially crave thrills. Look
how they rush t’ go under th’ knife fer th’
thrill of an operation. Ther hain’t a thrill
left in housekeepin’, ’cept perhaps climbin’
on a stepladder now an’ then. Men, too,
are beginnin’ t’ complain. They git a
thrill out o’ spendin’ money, but earnin’ it
is growin’ tiresome an’ prosy.

“It’s the great variety o’ present day
thrills that’s alarmin’. Robbin’ a bank
when you don’t need th’ money, drinkin’
anything that smells like formaldehyde,
startin’ off t’ Paris in one-motor planes,
walkin’ home from thickets at three a. m.
I don’t believe ther’s any thrill left t’ a
first kiss; it comes to easy these days.
We're gettin’ so blase that we walk out
on a lion act.”

a day or hour may bring forth. Without

a Guide, we run into the line separating
the finite from the infinite, and are apt to
lose our mental stability in this realm un-
suited to man’s petty reasoning powers.

Fear of physical disability faces all of
us; and though we may find a Milton or
Scott occasionally who can surmount these
obstacles, the average person is very much
depressed by handicaps of this nature.
Likewise, the man of the world who sees
his youthful dreams of success fading, is
prone to feel embittered and that life is
not worth living.

Yet the All-powerful Friend, “For all
power is given unto Himin heaven and on
earth,” will be our constant Guide, Com-
