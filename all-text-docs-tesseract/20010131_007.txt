THE Pa

By Derek Lou
Staff Writer

The Pledge reminded me of John Sayles’
Limbo in the way that it transcends its genre
to become a movie about something, not just
its plot.

Sean Penn’s film is
disguised as a thriller
involving a serial killer
who preys on little
blonde girls in red
dresses. Underneath its
engaging storyline is a
movie about how
promises can lead to
obsession.

finds himself with the
burden of delivering
the bad news to the
girl’s parents ina scene
that itself is worth the
price of admission.

Patricia Clarkson, who was unforgettable
as a junkie in the best romance of recent
years, High Art, plays the girl’s mother. She
asks Black to promise to find her daughter’ s
killer. He swears he will, and so we have the
movie’s title and the set-up for a study of
obsession.

the body. Exploiting his mental capacity, the
police get a quick confession and an end to
the case. Jerry senses something is wrong,
and keeping his promise, he devotes his life to
finding the real killer.

Jerry sets up two traps in hopes of finding

cethe killer. sined are so wonderfully subtle that

I don’t want to reveal
them. All I will say is
that we are so ab-
sorbed by the film that
we don’t realize the
horrifying existence
of the, second trap un-
til it may backfire and
end someone’s life.
This is one of the great
things about The
Pledge: the way that
Nicholson’s perfor-
mance and Penn’s di-
rection prevent the au-
- dience from recogniz-
ing the depths to
which Jerry Black has
sunk.
But The Pledge
isn’tdeceptive like M.
Night Shyamalan’s
films; on the contrary,
it’s a little too honest
in its examination of Nicholson’s character.
Penn gives us too many shots of Jerry pretty
much doing nothing. At first they are effec-
tive and inspire the viewer to think about
Jerry’s predicament. But after a while, they
become boring, and we are restless rather
than meditative.

Also, I had trouble believing the catalyst
for Jerry’s obsession, the pledge. He is a
good, honest cop who makes a promise he

into the ground and turn him insane?

I forgive The Pledge for these flaws for a.-

few reasons. First, I liked Jack Nicholson’s
quiet performance that anchors the film in
reality. I also was intrigued by some of the
small touches of Jerzy Kromolowski and
Mary Olson-Kromolowski’s script. For ex-
ample, there are a number of mentally re-
tarded characters in the story, which are used
not as novelties, but as symbols for Jerry’s
diminishing sanity. Finally, it is rare to find

a movie so dedicated to its ideas eather bigs
its plot.

Though it does provide us with an explana-
tion to the murder, the film does not care
about that resolution as much as it does about
the changes in Jerry Black. And after all the
thrillers I’ve seen about perverted killers, I
was grateful to see thriller about a character,
rather than perversity, stakeouts, and chase
sequences.

Snatch fun but slight

By PuHILuip STEWART
Staff Writer

Guy Ritchie’s Snatch is fitful entertain-
ment, but it’s not going to make the splash
that his first film, the exhilarating Lock Stock
and Two Smoking Barrels, did.

There is nothing
new here. Worse,
what is there feels
somewhat stale and
over-baked—the
shots feel more like
gimmickry than use-
ful stylistic nuance, {
the characters have
obnoxious descrip-
tive nicknames like
Franky Four Fingers,
and slight character
actions cause major
plot ripples (think a
mob version of Seinfeld).

In one particular scene, a character opens a
window to eliminate a smell; by this time in
the movie, we are so in tune with the screen-

{There's never been a better time to build your career with us}

play, we know by opening that window,
something catastrophic will happen. I was
reminded of the Seinfeld episode when Kramer
drops a Junior Mint into a man’s chest cavity
while observing surgery; that Junior Mint
turned out to save the patient’s life.

The film is full of unexpected surprises and
some great lines, and the
performances by Brad Pitt
and the wonderful Dennis
Farina (Get Shorty) out-
shine the mostly British
cast.

Benicio del Toro gives

another brilliant acting
| job; he has turned into one
of the most prolific, en-
gaging, and brilliant ac-
tors working today.

Guy Ritchieisa talented
director. It?s a shame he
makes this film without
taking any risks. The movie will not hurt his
career, but it certainly won’t get him any
closer to greatness.
