murdered in Cincinnati, Ohio in
1978.

form a support group with other
local families who were stricken
with a similar tragedy.

In 1981, the organization was

formally chartered as Parents of
Murdered Children or Other Sur-
vivors of Homicide Victims, or
POMC, and hasexploded in growth
with new chapters nation wide.

The organization exhibits a

Mark's Gospel
Solo Performance

To Be Presented

By Meredith Hammons

Max McLean will be present-
ing his acclaimed solo perform-
ance of Mark’s Gospel on Thurs-
day, February 7 at 8:15 pm in the
900 Room of the College Union.

Mark’s Gospel has toured all
over the United States, Canada,
and overseas before thousands of
people in colleges, seminaries,
conferences, churches, and con-
ventions.

Mark’s Gospel is believed to
be the earliest account of the life
and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.
McLean said, Many people per-
ceive the gospel as obscure and
hard to understand. It’s not. It’sa
story written to be told. When
liberated from the printed page it
springs to vibrant life. Jesus be-

comes more accessible and wecan’ “~~

encounter Him just as His follow-
ers did.”

Charles Colson, author and
columnist for Christianity Today
Magazine, writes, “Max mcLean
is an extraordinarily gifted Chris-
tian artist. His dramatization of
Mark brings the gospel to life ina
unique and powerful way. I-felt
like I was there-- with Jesus-- in
the greatest drama of all time.”

“In presenting Mark he uses
no costumes, no makeup, no po-
dium, and no props other than a
chair.

Audiences quietly lost track of
the fact that McLean in quoting
Bible verses.

They even forget that he is
using carefully rehearsed body

motions, facial expressions and
voice inflections.

Instead they sit engrossed in
the story of Jesus,” wrote Moody
Monthly Magazine.

As an actor McLean has per-
formed a number of leading roles
in Great Britain, Europe and New
York, including Stanley in A
Streetcar Named Desire, Snoopy
in You’re a Good Man, Charlie
Brown, Berowne in Love’s La-
bors Lost, and the Priest in Mur-
der in the Cathedral.

Born in 1953 in Panama City,
Panama, McLean came to the
United States at age four. Because
of his father’s career as a military
officer, McLean lived in various
places across the United States, the
Far East, and Europe... -

“striving to protect the faith.”
“Jihad is almost always under-

‘taqwa’, that Muslims feel God
has put within all human beings.
One of the Islamic beliefs is that at

Dr. Grant believes that there

sympathetic to his views. He also
thinks that the college is not that

" interested with conserving its natu-

ral green spaces.

Besides Dr. Grant, there has
been no other vocal opposition to
the project. Most in the depart-
ment have remained quiet on the
subject of the development. Oth-
ers, such as Associate Professor
Verna Jean Case, are torn between
wanting to preserve the land and

Mahony believes that Ameri-
cans should make a greater effort
to learn about Islam, which is now
the world’s fastest growing reli- ~
gion. Demographers predict that
in the United States, Muslims will
outnumber Jews in another 30 or
40 years.

Mahony hopes for another “day
of Abraham,” whenall Jews, Chris-
tians, and Muslims will all sitdown
at the same table. The three relig-
ions share many of the same basic
beliefs, and trace their lineage to
the same great biblical patriarchs.

“Tslam is not so different from

Sutton said that alternatives will

done: by possibly leasing a pond
for biological needs.

According to Sutton, over the
next five years there could be up to
120homes on the property. Around
two-thirds of this will be available
for purchase by the faculty, staff,
and the general public. The other
portion will be leased to faculty
and staff. In this way, the College
wouldretain ownership of some of
the land throughout the- years.
Sutton comments that this will,
“provide affordable housing for
faculty in the long haul.”

The project will begin in three or
four months after financial matters
and other issues are resolved.
Sutton believes that there will
