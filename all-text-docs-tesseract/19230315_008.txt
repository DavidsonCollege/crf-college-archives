will be unusually keen. An exhibi-
tion of some real oratory will be the
order of the morning.

In the ‘afternoon the first of the
two baseball games with Oakridge

good games are certain. Come out,
and watch Buck’s proteges in their
first two contests. :

HANK THE HIPPO DOES THE

Probably anticipating the untime-

The “As-you-like-it” Club will be
entertained by Mrs. O. J. Theis on
Friday afternoon. This club meets
every two weeks and is composed
of the wives of the younger mem-
bers of the Davidson faculty to-
gether with other young ladies of
lthe town.

Hippo the Houck has begun spring

the first day work-out was the de-
monstrating of the Darwin theory
by the ascent of the bare walls of
the placid front which makes up the
face of West.

The immediate occasion of such
a perilous work-out was said to
have been the betting by casual on-
lookers as to Hippo’s inability to
perform the seemingly impossible,
coupled with his burning desire to
show himself as the logical succes-
|sor of Young.

a well turned ankle seems more de-
sired than a well turned or witty |
line. “That DeKoven set the whole |
English speaking world ‘agoing

cal and dramatic parlance. The rea-|
son is that dear old Robin, with its
clever tale of the twelfth century
and its tunes that just naturally

won't die, furnishes, as the press |

agent well said, ‘musical thrills and
scenic beauty unsurpassed’,”

“Robin Hood” is more than an
opera—it’s an institution, and a part
of a liberal education, and as long
as Americans are Americans, a
worthy presentation of it will attract
a host to enjoy it. It is May Val-
entine’s production that is coming,
the identical cast, one and all that
has played it the entire past year in
more than two hundred cities includ-
ing the best theaters of Louisville,
Indianapolis, Omaha, Chicago,
Washington, Baltimore, New York,
Philadelphia, Detroit and Cincin-
nati.

It wil be at the Auditorium, Char-
lotte, N. C., Tuesday, March 20th,
1923.

‘Ask a Girl for Speaking’

DR. LANE LECTURES
Continued from Page 1
Doctor Lane made very clear the

inconsistences that have appeared in
the attitude of the Allies toward the
Turk since 1914. The failure on the
part of France and Britain to act to-
gether has allowed the complete de-
feat of the Grecian armies.

Turkey demands recognition as a
nation, and India is making the same
claim. Turkey, however, is the first
Asiatic nation that has taken definite
steps toward bringing about this rec-
ognition. .This recognition will not
come soon, Doctor Lane said, but,
just as in the case of Japan, he be-
lieves that there will some day arise
a new Turkey that’ will deserve and
receive it.

‘Education is a capital to a poor
man and an interest to a rich man.

tertainment for the young members
fo her Sunday School class on Tues-
day of last’'week. The six little girls
with the six young men they had
invited played from seven thirty to
nine o'clock, and then enjoyed the
delicious refreshments the hostess
had prepared for them.

he groups consisted of Daisy

Charles DeVane, Sarah Thompson,
Billy Hunter,Susie Jackson, Fred
Fleagle, Mary Foys and John With-
ers, John D. McConnell and Eliza

Dr. Lingle filled the pulpit of the
First Presbyterian Church of Dur-
ham last Sunday, in the absence of
the pastor who is on a tour of Pales-
tine. Dr. Lingle preached at both
the morning and night services and
delivered splendid sermons.

The Health Committee is to have
charge of the window display at
Goodrum’s store during this week.
Mrs. Withers is the the chairman of
this committee.

The Book Lover's Club met with
Mrs. W. R. Grey, Friday afternoon
and the program for the coming
year was discussed.

Miss Mary Black has been quite
ill for several days and her large
circle of friends joim is wishing her
a speedy recovery.

Dr. C, M. Richards and Dr, J. M.
McConnell were visitors in Winston-
Salem last Monday on college busi-
ness,

The Thelemite Book Club held
its April meeting at the home of
Dr. and Mrs. W. J. Martin, Wed-

read a paper on “West Point as a
character builder.” Refreshments
were served at the conclusion.

'those higher up in the art to which
