THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

They Said It Couldn't Be Done

If our recent visitor Mr. Khrush-
chev had come to Davidson and ap-
proached a member of the Class of
*63—as he surely would, due to the
red beanies—with the request to
“take me to your leader’ he would
more than likely not have been taken
to Mr. Martin’s office. The freshman
would rather have tipped his red hat
and taken Mr. K straight to Court of
Control Judge Milton. Gee.

Members of the upper three class-
es can hardly do more than stand in
open - mouthed awe as they watch
Court Judge Milton Gee weld the
Class of ’63 into a body solidly be-
hind him and the Court.

This reaction is understandable;
everyone was expecting the tradition-
al “Hate Gee” chants from the frosh.
We can’t remember a judge who
wasn’t sneered and jeered at.

The applause and cries of “There's

‘Bigotry’... Or
Self-Preservation

“The New York Times gave page
one display to the shooting in Puerto
Rican gang ambush of a_ Bronx”
schoolboy. In deddpan style The
Times reported that “the killing was
the first since school opened last
week; six other juveniles died this
summer in attacks on the city’s
streets.”

Commenting on the protest of
parents in Glendale, another section
of New York City where Negro and
Puerto Rican pupils are being trans-
ferred in an effort to integrate
schools, The New York Herald Trib-
une said in an editorial that the
parents’ behavior was-“shameful . . .
intolerable . . . an ugly thing...
turning an eight, nine or ten year old
child into a todl of bigotry.”

Some parents are peculiar enough
to risk bigotry in the hope of pre-
serving life in their children.”

An Opportunity
To Learn

The “Book of the Semester Pro-
gram” is gaining steam as the date
for the arrival of Vance Packard
draws near. Tommy Colvin and 4co-
horts have been in seclusion for! the
Jast several weeks attending to the
details of the visit of our important
guest on October 21.

Already, Colvin reports, approxi-
mately two hundred of the seven
hundred copies of “The Status Seek-
ers’ ordered have been purchased
and the drive to sell them to interest-
ed alumni and other patrons of the
college has just been launched.

Also plans have been formulated
to secure a panel of distinguished
men from Charlotte and surrounding
localities to question Packard on his
views. If this part of the program is
successfully arranged, it should add
much to his visit.

our leader!’’ as a Judge returns from
recovering a freshman cap mark a
new day, we think, in the Court of
Control.

Even more of a tribute is the fact
j that it is Gee who is largely responsi-

spirit. Acting in conjunction with sev-

was Gee who engineered and executed
the pep rally and bonfire last Friday
night. We seniors had never seen a
Davidson pep rally before, nor can
we remember giving whole-hearted
support to the football team on a Sat-
urday afternoon.

The proverbial shot in the arm
has been administered, and the ball
has started rolling. All we can hope
is that it has enough momentum to
keep rolling and gain speed. With the
Court and the Class of '63 pushing,
we think we have a good case.

agreed to devote his Vesper’s sermon
the Sunday evening before Packard
arrives to the problems of status
seeking. Plans have also been laid to
have various professors familiarize
themselves with the work so as to
be able to lead student discussions
on the topic.

To add spice to the occasion, a
bus may be chartered to bring inter-
ested status seekers from our sister
institution, Queens College.

As anyone can see, a lot of hard
work has gone into this project. It
needs just one more thing—student
support. One doesn’t need an editor-
ial writer to tell him that nothing
can succeed on this campus, or any
other for that matter, unless it has
the students behind it.

The DAVIDSONIAN urges that
the students and faculty, read the
book and support the program. A lit-
tle enthusiastic support never hurt
anybody. Besides, we might learn
something.

Big Dividends

A Swedish in ialist who visit-
ed the campus this week was im-
pressed most not by the fine physical
plant or the highly reputed Davidson
faculty, but by a-tradition.

All too often we forget the im-
portance of the little everyday things
that are so important to the David-
son way of life.

‘

The visitor was -most impressed
by the friendliness and cordiality of
the students. So impressed was he
that remarked that this is the kind
of Americana that Chairman Khrush-
chev should have been shown. “It is
so warm and friendly here,” he re-
marked. It seemed a bit funny that
he should be so impressed, but his
reaction was typical.

The next time you see a stranger
on campus be extra friendly. Show
him that he is welcome. He may be
an alumnus, the father of a student—
or Mr. Dana.

HOW GOOD IS TOO GOOD?

Is Davidson Too Hard To Get Into? Facts Say “No”

By ERVIN DUGGAN
Davidsonian Managing Editor
Is it too hard to get into Da-

| vidson College?

SS

Faculty and administration
Officials this week answered a
resounding “No!” in the face
of growing criticism from alum-
ni, would-be applicants, and
athletic: department officials.

“We're right at the top in
the South,” said Assistant Dean
H. Edmunds White this week,
“But we've still got a long way
to go before .we’re at the top
of the heap.”

Davidson students, consistent-
ly chalking up the highest col-
lege board scores in the south-
east, still cannot compete with
the established eastern schools,
he said. This year, he reported,
ten per cent of Davidson's
freshmen were turned down by
other schools—some by more
than one college.

“Most of the schools which
rejected present Davidson stu-
dents -were Ivy League
schools,” White said. “Rice In-
stitute in Texas is the only
southern college which reject-
ed a Davidson applicant. But
Williams, Princeton, Yale,
Dartmouth, Amberst; Oberlin,
the.service academies and some
others all turned down one or
more applicants who are now
students at Davidson.”

INTELLECTUAL HAVEN?

The figures released by White
tended to alter somewhat the

image, created by detractors of
the college admissions commit-
tee, of Davidson as a haven for
intellectuals of the genius cate-
gory only.

The admissions committee has
met widespread criticism re-
cently concerning the difficul-
ty of gaining admission for top
athletes, alumni sons and sons
of possible donors to the col-
lege,

White stressed that the
search of the admissiops com-
mittee for top-quality academic
prospects in no way implied
that the consideration of extra-
curricular and athletic achieve-
ment was neglected, as wide-
spread rumors concerning the
admissions policy have  inti-
mated.

According to statistics con-
cerning college board entrance
examination scores, Davidson
students score higher than any
other leading schools in the
South. Last year’s test scores
indicate that Davidson stands
at the top among southern
schools, but is considerably be-
low many northern and west-
ern schools.

DAVIDSON (Q: 120

Just what are the capabilities
of Davidson students as_ indi-
cated by entrance test scores
and high school records? Fig-
ures from the college testing
center and the registrar’s of-
fice indicate that Davidson is

dents—but few so brilliant as
to discourage “normal” candi-
dates from applying for admis-
sions.

“The mid-score on the college
board tests at Davidson is
somewhere between 550 and
570," said Professor Jay Ost-
walt. “This is well above the
‘national overage, which is
about 450.” Ostwalt estimated
the median Davidson 1.Q. at
“around 120,” a score consid-
ered in the “superior” category
by testing experts. :

He stated that the high
school average of Davidson ap-
plicants averaged about 93 this
year: “somewhat higher than
that in past years.” The class
of 1960 had a high-school av-
erage of 91.5; that of the class
of 1961 was 90.5.

TOP MEN OF ‘63

Forty students in the class
of 1963—about twenty per cent
of the class — were valedic-
torians, salutatorians, third or
fourth ranking students in their
respective classes, according to
college registrar F. W. Henge-
veld.

Three students this year
achieved scores in the near-per-
fect percentiles on the mathe-
matics division of the College
Board tests, reporting’ scores
above 750 of a possible 800.
Eleven students admitted by
the college reported scores be-
low the national average on one
category, but Hengeveld stress-

In The Quiet College Atmosphere
A Comfortable Decay Sets In

By JACK TAYLOR

In his small, dimly lit office carried with more pride.

on the third floor of Chambers,
Professor John Christian Do-
right ‘leaned back placidly in
his well-worn leather chair and
inhaled deeply, adding to the
glow of contentment which al-
ready warmed him.

Autumn had arrived in force,
priging with it the Professor’s
feeling of well-being, for this
was ‘the season which he loved
best.

Professor Doright knew that
these sentiments were not
shared by everyone. There
were many who regretted Au-
tumn’s arrival, who thought of
Autumn as dormant and death-
like, as an evil that sapped life
from all that lived.

But, for Professor Doright,
Autumn signaled a return to
sanity, a time when things
settled back into their old
postures and habits, returned
to their normal, usual ways.
For him, Autumn was simple,
certain, and reassuring.

Also, with the coming of
Fall, came the students. “His
boys” had become the Profes-
sor’s life, his very existence,
and he bestowed upon them
every ounce of fatherly devo-
tion -and affection’ which his
tired old heart could muster.
“Father John” they called
him, and no laurel was ever

Professor Doright trusted
his boys, but, like the father
who waits up for his son‘s re-
turn each night, he worried
about them when they were
away for any length of time.

They were young and imma-
ture; hardly old enough or
strong enough to protect them-
selves against the cruel reali-
ties of life. Professor Doright
always felt a sense of relief
when they returned to the fold.

The professor had neither
time nor respect for those
heretics who were constantly
screaming that experience
was the best teacher, that
birds learned to fly by be-
ing pushed from the nest
at an early age.

“His boys" would Jearn of
the world all too soon; it was
best to condition them first to
the right things in life, that
they might have something to
cling to when the nest was
gone and the full force of the

gale struck them.

Here, in the safety and se-
curity that are Davidson, he
could teach “his boys” the
right values, give them the
right answers, and guide them
along the right paths.

As the sapling is bent, so
the tree grows. This philoso-
phy became an intrinsic part
of the professor's teachings.
His tecture notes were
steeped in the right values,
the accepted attitudes, the
traditional answers. Not a
question was asked, not an
unknown pondered. Nor, for
the past fifteen years, had
he felt any need to revise
or review his notes.

Long shafts of dusty light
fell across the room, giving it
‘ahe hollow appearance of a
medieval cloister. A stench
of staleness hung in the air.
Slowly, contentedly, Professor
John Christian Doright inhaled
the sweetness of his comforta-
bly old pipe.

ed that no students are admit-
ted whose low scores in one
category are not brought up to
an acceptable level by high
scores in another division.

“NO APOLOGIES”

The facts released this week
indicated that Davidson is ad-
mitting students of good—but
not of the very best—academic
quality. But alumni, coaches,
and even some faculty members

TOIL AND TROUBLE

still complained that Davidson's
“ood” is too good.

One admissions official sum-
med it up: “It’s hard to satisfy
everybody. We're being ac-
cused of looking only for
geniuses, which isn’t true at
all. But I'm convinced that we
need not apologize for seeking

-out and finding the best ada-

demic bets for Davidson; that’s
what’ we're doing now.”

National Debt Is

Thorn In Our Side:

By JOHN STONE

The United States govern-
ment owes more money than
all other governments in the
world—-combined. The question
is: How dangerous to our na-
tional well-being is the debt?
If, we find it dangerous, what
can be done about it?

The debt is about $290,000,
000,000. Assuming that we
ean’t pay this sum out of hand,
there arises the necessity for
servicing the debt more ef-
ficiently and for countering the
inflationary pressures caused
by it.

First, however, let us look
at some relatively hopeful
statistics. In 1946 the debt
was equal to 125% of the
gross national wealth. In
1957 it was worth but 65%
of the same.

Between 1953 and 1957 the
debt rose only 4%. Private debt
in 1957 was 62.7% of all in-
debtedness, public and private.
Furthermore, most of the debt
arose from moneys borrowed
to fight World War II, so we
must inveigh more against war
than any inefficiency.

The servicing of the debt
would be of little consequence
as a problem if it were not

Bae:

at the moment, there is an
unhealthy condition surround-
ing the ownership of the
debt. The debt is owned by
those of great wealth; indi-
viduals, banks, and corpora-
tions.

The primary source of money
for interest, however, is the
taxes of the persons of ordinary
means. Thus wealth is redis-
tributed upwards. One simple
solution to this is to increase
the income tax in the upper —
brackets. I don’t see this hap-
pening anytime soon.

The problem of the infla-
tionary pressure exerted by
the debt is perhaps solved
more easily in terms of
political resistance. At pres-
ent the government is doing
most of its borrowing from
commercial banks. This in-
creases the supply of money,
making alt money less valu-
able.

The problem is to put the
ownership of the debt in pri-
vate hands. Before this can bo
done, if is necessary that in-
terest rates be hiked slightly,
and that all bonds be long-term
— perhaps even sold in the
open market. This would also
expand significantly the. base

a political issue. As it stends of ownership.

Inepressible Pair Is
Back After Western Tour

It’s not very good to be back at school this year.
Selma and I took a vacation trip through the West this
summer; everywhere we went we saw Davidson boys
canning peas. That takes a high degree of intelligence
and scrutinization; each pea has to be visually inspected
and passed. before it can be sealed in a can. The in-
spectors use forceps most of the time, but every now
and then you’d see a Davidson boy taking one im his
hand. o

As you know, Selma has been expecting ever since
last Homecoming, and, around. the middle of July, she
got just what she was expecting. An extra mouth to
feed and all the extra cargo shet our budget to pieces
as far as the trip was concerned, but things ironed them-
selves out a few weeks later when we discovered we'd
left it at a motel.

Selma’s been a little bit gloomy ever since, but I
keep telling her there’s another Homecoming in a few
weeks. Whenever anyone asks us, we look grave and
say, “We lost our last child.”

s e *

Selma got a little nervous at the prospect of going
to the bonfire Friday night, with all those men stanc
ing around, and all those Davidson students, too. I told
her she wouldn’t have any trouble if she played it cool.
“That's all you have to do af anybody’s pep rally to get
by; just be sophisticated.”

So I took her up to the Anchor to buy a little sophisti-
cation beforehand.

We.tried hard, but they quit selling it at quarter till
twelve and we still didn’t feel sophisticated enough to
come. It’s a lost cause with some of ds.

The YMCA, justifiably seeking status on the David...
son cainpus, has initiated the Book-of-the Semester pro-
gram. This in no way implies that Y members can read
only one book a semester, although the page-a-day plan
has proved successful. The college suggests that any
student unable to complete one book in a semester en-
roll in Professor Ostwalt’s Speed-Reading course for
cretins.

The author of the book under consideration is Vance
Packard. Packard, seeking literary status, whipped this
book off in less than a semester and is coming on cam-
pus to lead a symposium on the work.

Hundreds of Davidson students, seeking intellectual
status, have bought the book at the bookstore and are
now on page twenty-two.

Mr. Packard, a thinking man, has not only literary
status but also myriads of hobbies, one of which is chang-
ing base literature into gold.
