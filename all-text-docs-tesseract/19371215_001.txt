Professor Avery Patton, of the

dressed the group. Professor Pat-
ton discussed the difficulties that
a pre-mediea! student may expect

‘these difficulties by dridging the
gap between the undergraduate
school and the medical school.

A general business session was
held following the talk, and plans
were laid ‘for ‘the -ehapter—to visit
Duke Memorial Hospital. Also ar-
tangements were furthered to se-
cure prominent. physicians from
neighboring. cities for lectures here.
The program for the first meeting
after Christmas was projected, Joe
Bailey being asked to lecture on the
_Telation of photography, including
X-ray, to medicine.

J. B. Graham, president of the
chapter, announced that informa-
tion and statistics doneerning med-
ical schools had been received by
him from Dr. Morris Fishbein, edi-

--tor-of the American Medical Jour-

nal, and were available to anyone
