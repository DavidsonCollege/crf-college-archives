“‘We’re starting fresh with a

berts told the Trustees that
WDAV may well lose its license
because of an obscene record

Citelbonite: . that WDAV
broadcast a record by “‘someone
called Johnny-Piss-Off” on Oc-
tober 5 which ‘‘used all the
expletives I know.”
Although students complain
that Roberts trumped up her
statement in an attempt to
wrest the station away from its
_ former. management, Roberts
told the Trustees, ‘‘We can
expect a full investigation and
all the attendent publicity that
will bring. It is quite possible
we. will not be granted the
license for the station.”

Chairman of the Board War-
ner Hall said Tuesday that,
after talking with attorneys he
believes that it is quite likely
that WDAV will be investiga-
ted and that Monday’s decision
will make it ‘‘far easier for us to
defend ourselves.’’

Hall cited the example of a
Pennsylvania college station

WDAV is presently operating
on a $28,000 a year budget and
admitted this will probably
have to be revised.

“I think’ it's unquestionable
that it will cost more than that
now,”’ said Spencer, adding
there are other ways of cutting
costs.

Davidson’s president then
suggested that the station may
have to broadcast’ fewer hours
each day in an effort. to save
money.

“Also, students have charged
that the Trustees walked all
over the College’s 1976 Consti-

tution in making their decision. .

The Constitution gives pro-
gramming authority to the sta-
tion manager, gives the station
manager the same rights as the
editors of student publications,
and puts WDAV under the
control of the Media Board.

Thompson said, ‘“The Consti-
tution is evidently worthless
now. The Trustees just had no
respect for it when they made
their decision. I think that
President Spencer and the Exe-
cutive Committee practice the
lowest form of ethics, they’re
too low to be considered
ethics.’

‘Hall and Spencer seemed to
be relatively unperturbed by the
accusations that they had viola-

constitution was violated but '

sion depends on how involved

students become in the new .

WDAV.

Asked if they would now try
to cooperate with the Universi-
ty of North Carolina at Char-

‘lotte's WFAE, a radio station _

which will also be playing .

mostly classical music, to make
sure WDAV and WFAE do not

“step on each others broad-

casting toes, Hall and Spencer
said they would.

Hall said that UNCC and
Davidson are both members of
the Charlotte Consortium, and

_ that, “‘We don’t try to slit each

others’ throat.”

Both refused to give specifics
on the future of such coopera-
tion, but Spencer said he ex-

pected WDAV to become more
of a fine arts station and WFAE
to become more of a public
affairs station.

“WFAE would probably shift
in that direction,” he fgrecast,
because of their affiliation with
the National Public Radio net-
work.

Spencer said that he recently

suppert two NPR stations.

He wdtild not rule out the

possibility that WDAV will

seek NPR ties.
On Monday afternoon, just
after the Trustee statement was

‘Yeleased, about 10 former staff

members ransacked the WDAV
office.

tion’s office. They then tore
their posters and licenses off the
walls, shuffled many of the
station’s albums into the wrong -
jackets, removed their personal
property, and left.

whether the administration de-

liberately misled the students or
not.
An ‘faculty mem-

anonymous

ber said, ‘“‘Students were at
least allowed to believe, if not
encouraged, that things were
staying the same -- that there
were no major changes to be
made after the switch to high
power.’ oe

ted, “I think the students were
misled early on. I got the
feeling that (this type of station
has) been in the works all
along.’ :

White, however, felt that
“the purpose of the station was
from the beginning pretty clear-
ly to go classical.”

He expressed surprise at such
a strong reaction, ‘I guess I
know the Trustees would never

‘have sucked in so much money

if it weren’t going to be a
classical station.
“It’s -hard for me to under-

McKelway concurred on this
point, ‘I think it’s really too
bad the students involved could

-not understand the need for the

kind of programming the Trus-
tees want.

“A classical station is the
only reasonable sensible option.
There’s no justification for any
other kind of station. Everyone
should’ve understood that from
the first.”’

.MeKelway. did, however,
sympathize with the student

feeling ‘‘that they were not
frankly told what the station
was going to become.

“I don’t think there is any
doubt that that was a mistake.
I think the Administration was
wrong in not dealing with the
question ahead of time.”

Student opinion regarding
the reaction of the staff to the
Trustees decision was also

Boone said, ‘‘Some of the
things they did, like taking out
the control board, were -ridicu-
lous.

“T sympathize with the staff,
but I think it’s overreacting. It
doesn’t solve any problems.”’

Other students, however, saw
the actions as necessary.

Senior Rusty Vester re-
marked, ‘‘I think what the
students did was justified. I’m
pleased the students stood up to
the Administration.”

Another senior, David Haas,
said, ‘‘I guess the students had
a point to make, and this was.
probably the best way to do it.

_T_would as soon they not do
it this was though,’’ Haas
added.

Faculty, staff and students
expressed concern over the fi-
nancial viability of WDAV.
They questioned whether funds
and contributions to the College
should be used for a station run
by professionals rather than
students.

French Professor Lauren Yo-
der, Said, ‘It’s a very expen-
sive proposition and it may not
even achieve what it’s supposed
to if the station is going to be
run by professionals, it will be
an auxilary enterprise at David-
son, not really a full-fledged

part. If it’s student operated, it

Poe.

“The contral of the Trustees
should be limited to reviewing
what students propose,”’ he
continued.

Junior Merideth Durden be-
lieves, ‘‘The Administration
really doesn’t want student
input unless it’s on their own
terms.

“The Administration should
start a station of their own or
compensate the students with
another station.’.

The future of WDAV remains.
unclear, and there is no definite
answer to what solution, if any,
will be found to the problems
surrounding the controversy.

’ “One would wish we could all
start from. scratch now,”
McKelway concluded.
