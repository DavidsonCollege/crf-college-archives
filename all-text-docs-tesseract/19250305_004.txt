“Say,” the driver snarled, “this ticket is
two days old.”

“T've been waiting patiently.) Said the stu-

“LT can't see my hand before my face.”
“Great Scott! What's the matter?”
“Tisn't there, idiot.”

INFIRMARY NEWS

Flu and pneumonia are valiantly vieing
for supremacy in Mrs, Robson’s domain.
During the month of February, seventy-
seven sufferers submissively surrendered
themselves to the solicitude, and
concern of the college home for the in-
firm.

Many of those undergoing the pangs
of flu were chemically cured by Dr. Mac-
Connell, through his administration and
their inhalation of chlorine gas. Presi-
dent Coolidge was recently thus benefited.
The student body regrets to hear of
the critical condition of Charles Ander-
son, who is ill with lobar pneumonia.
They will be glad, however, to learn that
Dr. MacConnell reports that “the out-
look is favorable.”

Reds and Blacks
End Game in Tie

The second football game of the spring
series, played last Saturday the
“Reds” and the “Blacks,” ended in a_ tie,
0 to 0, and only twice was either goal in
danger. In the third quarter when the
Blacks forced the Reds back to their own
six-yard line, they threatened to score, but
failed to carry the ball across for a score.
Again in the last two minutes of play when
Grey, for the Reds, missed an attempt for
gol by a few feet. with a placement kick,
from the 20-yard line, the Blacks lost their
opportunity to win.

between

Throughout the game the crowd was im-
pressed by the excellent punting, which was
resorted to bysboth sides; and also the first
half, the Reds had a slight advantage over
the Blacks, and it was during this period that
they made three of their four fitst downs
while the Blacks made only one first down
During the seeond half, the Blacks appear -
ed to have the advantage and during this
time they made five first downs to one for the
Reds, which made a total of 6 to 4 for the
game.

There were no individual stars during the
game, but a few players need commendation
for their excellent playing. In the backtield,
“Red” MeCombs and Claude Allen were
especially noticed for their excellent work in
earrying the ball, while “Mutt® Nesbit and
“Count” Leggette did some very fine punt
ing. John Melton and Bob MeMillan both
showed up well in their end runs and. line
plunges. “Red Anderson and) Long did
some fine tackling, awd Baker, Arrowood and
Pinkney showed up well at the end positions,
Wilson and Wells displayed their usual good
judgment in running a team at quarter? and
Sims and Joe MeConnell tilled) the
positions with great-ability.
