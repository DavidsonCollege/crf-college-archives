Question

of the Week

A few of this country’s leading
universities employ the system of
unlimited cuts to all students. Such
freedom would of course, have both
its advantages and its faults, but
would it be possible in a school
the size of Davidson? Princeton
University, with one of the highest
enrollments in the United States,
maintains at the same time one of
the foremost scholastic ratings un-
der this system. Could Davidson,
with its small classes wherein the
close relationship of professor and
student is an important factor, up-
hold her standing  scholastically
without required class attendance?

Here is the question: What do
you think of the unlimited cut sys-
tem as applicable to Davidson Col-

lege?

I eo

Neal Scott, Junior:

This system would hardly be suc-
cessful for everyone in a_ school
the size of Davidson. However, it
would no doubt be a good thing
for Juniors and seniors who have

made a B average. These men
would continue to maintain their
high standing while poorer stu-

dents might tend to fall down in
their work with non-restricted at-
tendance.

*

Shaw Smith, Senior:

* * &

I'm entirely against such a pro-
gram in respect to freshmen and
sophomores, though perhaps _ it
would be a good thing for men in
the two upper classes who have a
high scholastic rating. If a man
doesn’t realize the value ‘of study
by his junior year, there’s little hope
and not much need of forcing him
to attend classes. The system calls
for an expulsion unless a man
keeps up his studies so this makes
a more definite check upon his
work than any cut system possibly
could,

dall Rose, Sop

e:

I'm thoroughly in favor of this
measure except in the case of fresh-
men. Davidson's calibre of work
will not permit a man to cut a
great deal without falling far be-
hind, and expelling a man who
fails checks upon his work more
accurately than the cut system.

Dick Shore, ‘Sophomore:

I believe that unlimited cuts
would never be effective in Dav-
idson College. There would be a
tendency to cut every class with
the result that about half the
school would fail. in their work.
Perhaps unlimited cuts could be
granted juniors and seniors for
maintaining a high average during
their first two years.

* * & *

Beverly Royster, Sophomore:

1 am of the opinion that fresh-
men and most sophomores would
not attend classes at all if this priy-
ilege were granted the whole
school. Juniors and seniors would
have learned the value of study in
their first two years and might be

given unlimited cuts profitably.
: f

, haat, dent, J

Walter Harper, Junior:

I think the unlimited cut sys-
tem would be fine at Davidson Col-
lege. Interest in their work and
fear of falling behind would cause
most students to attend classes reg-
ularly. If the constant threat of
being penalized for’ overcutting
classes were removed, the tendency
to overcut classes so often would

be less.

* * & &

Bobby Williams, Sophomore:

To my point of view the unlimit-
ed,cut system would be a decided
step forward in the history of
Davidson College. Many of the
leges and universities in the Unit-
ed States have adopted this sys-
tem almost universally, and we also
should follow the éxample of Ox-
ford-and Cambridge in this respect.
I think that this system would
prove the real merit of its students.

Student Body
Hears Bishop
Sunday Night

Father of J. C. Pfohl Delivers
Sermon on Personality

At Vespers
Bishop J. Kenneth Pfohl of the
Moravian Church in Winston-

Salem led the regular evening Ves-
per program last Sunday night. His |
sermon was based on “The Three
Questions that God Asks of Every
Man.”

After the responsive reading of
the scripture; which consisted of se-
lections from Psalm 119, Dr. P. H.
Gwynn of the faculty introduced
Bishop Pfohl to the audience “as
the head of a great church,” and |
“as the father of one of our fac-
ulty members.” §

Dr. Pfohl then began his sermon
by saying that he had a question
to which every man must seek the
answer, and this question is close-
ly allied with two other questions.
God was and is the greatest teach-
er in the world, the Bishop pointed
out, and He uses the question and
answer system of teaching because
He deals with intelligent individ-
uals who enjoy being mentally stim-
ulated. :

The first question was the ques-
tion which God asked of Adam in
the Garden of Eden just after he
and Eve had sinned. “Where art
thou,” asked God. This question
is as vital to us as it was to Adam.
In a world in which the conditions
are such as they are today a man
must take time out to discover
where he stands, and if he is not
satisfied with his position, he must
do something about it.

The second question was asked

of Cain just after he had killed
Abel. God asked Cain, “Where
is thy brother?” Does not this

question face every individual to-
day, not only in the war-torn areas
of China and Spain, but even here
in America. Here in the peace-
fulness of our democracy, we are
inclined to forget our fellowmen.
We should realize the challenge of

this question and try to better our- |

selves accordingly.

The third question is found in
Exodus 4:2, and it was asked of
Moses when he was by the burn-
ing bush. Moses had shown. fear
of carrying out the great plan of
God, and suddenly he was met with
the question: “What is that which
is in thine hand?” He had a rod
in his hand, and we know by God's
miracle of changing the rod into a
snake that Moses’ faith was
strengthened. By this question ‘God
means for us to take account of the
talents and benefits that He gave
us, and even though they may seem
small, through the grace of God
they can become gigantic factors in
the spreading of Christianity. No
man should use as an excuse for
not doing something, “I am not
gifted in any way,” for it is up to
every man to discover in
ways he is gifted.

God gave every man an individ-

Spanish Frat
Initiates Two

Sigma Delta Pi Bids Jim Bal-
lard, Jack Lee

On the evening of October 17 two
new members were initiated into
Davidson’s Omega chapter of Sig-
ma Delta Pi, national honorary
Spanish fraternity. The initiates
were Jim Ballard and Jack Lee.

The chapter also decided to work
up and present a number of one-
act plays as a special feature to
be presented in conjunction with
other colleges who have groups
especially interested in Spanish.

Sigma Delta Pi has about forty

what

chapters in various colleges and
universities throughout the United
States, and its requirements for

membership are based upon one
semester of advanced Spanish be-
yond that required for graduation.
