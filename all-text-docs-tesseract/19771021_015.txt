By BAD BERNARD
and HOGMAN

There is a tremendous strain
on us to write the IMAC
column this week. We have
been the targets of abuse and
the butt of so many jokes that
we find it hard to continue
writing in our positive cons-
tructive manner.

Hogman finds it impossible
to function in the wake of the
narrow loss to the rump roasts
of Texas. Bernard was sent
into mourning when he learned
that his former friend and
coach, Ray Mears, was
shipped to the crazy house for

How you people think that is
funny is beyond me.
Bernie, in his kind manner,
looked beyond the abuse and
sent Ray a box of Dog Chow
< 1d a few steak bones.
Besides having to weather
the comments about the Ra-
zorbacks and Mears, we have
received a pantload of comp-
laints from the female flicker-
ball population about our lack
of coverage of girls’ flickerball.
In response to that pressure,
we would like to dedicate the
rest of this paragraph to
Aj presenting our first annual

| girls’ flickerball awards, keep-
ing in mind that girls’ flicker-
ball is a legitimate IMAC
sport.

L.D. Simmons, with rounds
of 74 and 73, finished in
second place and led the golf
team to a third place finish at
the Eighth Annual Etowah
Golf Invitational.

Despite the heavy tackle
golf schedule earlier this fall,
the golfers were in third the
whole way behind two first
rate golf schools, Georgia

Now that we've met our
‘equal time’ obligations, we
can get on to the real world of
flickerball.

The last weeks of the season
presented IMAC diehards
with some big-time games
before the beginning of the
tournament. In the biggest
game of the week the SAE’s
behind Mike “I Spike” Dais-
ley and Jim ‘“‘Christy Moore
Where Are You?’’ put on a
second half surge to beat the
War Kiwis 40-24.

MacFleet and Stuff, utili-
zing Johnny Stroud’s speed
and Bill McKinley's fists,
pounded the previously un-
beaten Whizz Kids 34-18.

Fupped Duck played its las?
game of the season and drib-
bled past KA #2 44-0. The
Ducks. most now leave the
world of big-time Top Ten and
play Davidson basketball in-
stead.

The FIJI’s remained un-
defeated with a sterling 25-6

‘ victory over the paraplegics of

Hiya-Hiya. That game

marked the 15th consecutive
FIJI game played on Field #1.
Hmm.

The Steel Raisins bolted
from the third spot in our
bottom ten when they stum-
bled past 2nd Richardson's

Beavers 24-21.

David Shi's jokes kept KA
#2's defense at bay and Jeff
Frank clubbed the Southern
Boy's offense senseless with
his tennis racket as the Old
Men triumphed 38-0.

KA #1 took two unimpres-
sive squeakers from Pika (73-
6) and the SPE’s (47-6).

In other games, the Bongs
crushed Son of Somf 77-0 and
PAX 38-0. 2nd Watts kicked
the Nads 48-6 while the Delts
nipped the Beavers 13-7. Seat-

The flickerball tournament
is supposed to start next
Tuesday with all teams sched-
uled to play. A meeting will be
held this Sunday evening to

tournament and to clarify
rules.

Every team is asked to send
a representative.

Graeme Thompson will also
raffle off the things he’s ripped
off from the equipment room.

Reggie Jackson and the
Yankees suck. Later.
