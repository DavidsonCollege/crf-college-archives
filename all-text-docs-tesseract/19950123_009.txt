THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1995 ;

At the end of last semester
there was a little controversy con-
cerning a minority men’s lock-in,
in which a member of the Nation of
Islam was invited to speak. A Mr.
Alan Staggers wrote an inflamma-
‘tory article to The Davidsonian
because he felt that he was dis-
criminated against when he was
not allowed to hear the speaker.
He also suggested that the meeting
was called to discuss hate, because
he belitves the Nation practices
such things. I want to make it clear
that these assumptions were to-
tally unfounded, and obviously
written out of anger.

The meeting was held because
some Davidsonemployees felt that
there seemed to be a lack of unity
and a high level of apathy among
Davidson minority males. It was
invitation only because the parties
involved wanted to have a frank
discussion on what should be done
to squelch apathy and disunity
among the men. The meeting was’
held in the BSC house, yet it was

not a sanctioned BSC event and
several BSC members were ex-
cluded because of this. Mr. Stag-
gers was not turned away because
of his race. Rather, he was turned
away because he was not invited,
and frankly, because the meeting
did not concern him.

A member of The Nation of
Islam was invited because his pres-
ence would assure that a large per-
centage of minority men on cam-
pus would show. The only reason
I was interested in going was be-
cause of Minister Lee. He spoke
for no more than twenty minutes,
yet the meeting lasted almost three
hours. So, needless to say, he was
not the reason for the meeting.

Mr. Staggers asked if such a
group should have been invited to
Davidson. ‘To answer that, you

have to know its importance in the
minority community. Regardless
of how the Nation is viewed from
the outside, it has a powerful and
positive force within the African-
American community. Itis the one
organization that has been with us
since before the Civil Rights move-
ment and is still strong today.
Even though I do not know
much about the Nation of Islam, it
does not seem to teach hate of any
race. As the speaker emphasized
that ‘night, “The Nation of Islam
has no reason to hate white people.”
What it does teach is self-love and
the importance of self-knowledge.
It is a separatist group, which is

- why many people, white and Afri-

can-Americans alike, question its
true worth. It is important because
it is the one group that forces us to

see ourselves in a positive and re-
alistic light. It is the one group that
believes we have to do for our-
selves what no one else is going to
do for us. It teaches the impor-
tance of hard work, and the power
of unity. Isn’t this what we all
want to see from the entire Afri-
can-American population? Hard-
work and unity!

I, too, was skeptical of Minis- ©

ter Lee’s presence, because I do
not agree with everything the Na-
tion does, but I knew that the
speaker was not called to discuss
hate. Because of that lock-in, I
now believe that minority men are
in a much better position to handle
Davidson College life and make
positive and progressive changes
for themselves.

I want to finish by saying that

Mr. Staggers grossly misrepre-
sented the BSC in his article. As I
stated before, the lock-in was not a
BSC event. The BSC has always
welcomed the membership of any
student of any race. Its purpose
has always been to create a posi-
tive environment for minorities,
and tocreate racial harmony among
all of Davidson’s students. Even
though this policy has always been
used, there are still not many
caucasian members of the BSC.
To go further, the BSC has always .
expressed the need to see more
Davidson students at all of its
events, yet there seems to be an
overall lack of interest on the part
of most Davidson students. You
are not only allowed, but you are
wanted at BSC functions!

Mr. Staggers, as for your state-
ment: “But then I’m only a little
ignorant white-boy who doesn’t
understand, right?” If the content
of your article is an indication,
then that may not be far from the
truth.

and donated bone marrow to needy
recipients. Considering the odds
of finding a match on the national
register, it is hard to believe that
our community could witness so
many examples of the good that
this program can accomplish.
Bone marrow transplants are

Davidson community on the Reg-

This week Project Life is host-

Soucey was the recipient of a life-
saving marrow transplant in 1993.
As mentioned in the front page

unable to finda tissue match among
family members, it is extremely
difficult to find a suitable unre-
lated volunteer donor. The chances
of finding an unrelated donor with
a complementary tissue type are
about 1 in 20,000. Each year these
odds are improved by the work of
our organization. In the past five

lights display was a carefully
planned collective effort supported
in full by every member of the
house. I was, however, very disap-
pointed by the reaction of almost
every single member of Phi Delt
whom I confronted—most of them
responded by saying, “Hey, I didn’t
doit,” or “It wasn’t me, I promise,”
or “It’s just a joke, lighten up.”
The fact is, it’s not a joke.
There is a difference between call-
ing a group of men hogs and mak-
ing acrude reference to a woman’s
sexual organs. Referring to a
woman as a “ho” or a “box” de-
means and degrades her sexuality.
It reduces her entire body to a
sexual entity alone. When you

insult my sexuality, you insult my
worth as a person.

Those who pleaded innocence
might reconsider their silent role
inthe matter. Becoming amember
of a house does not mean that you
automatically assume the stereo-
typical image of its members, but
you must, however, take responsi-
bility for an action that reflects
upon the whole house. If youdon’t

support your fraternity brothers’
actions, why not take a stand in the

house and voice your opposition?
If youcan’tdo even this, could you
at least unplug the lights?

I don’t believe that Davidson
should do away with the fraternity
system. Ido, however, believe that
we live in a society that exploits
and demeans women’s sexuality

one night stand

in all areas—from advertising and
the media to yes, even the frater-
nity house. The women of Connor
and the women of Davidson de-
serve far better than that, and I
think it’s about time-that the men
and women of this college com-
munity give some thought to the
way we relate to each other.
Maybe I shouldn’t be so dis-
turbed—after all, we trek down to

’ Patterson Courtevery weekend for

another party filled with slurred
conversations and casual sex. Quite
a tragedy, in my opinion, for I
think that men and women at
Davidson have far more to offer to
one another than a few beers and a
one-night stand.

Objectivity in knowledge an eigen goal

are of great import forthe College’s
advance into the front ranks of
American liberal arts institutions.

Nonetheless, it is important to
be precise about the reasons why
the requirement should be dropped.
SGA President Eric Rosenbach was
quoted as saying that ‘the idea of
being taught Buddhist traditions
by a Buddhist monk, for example,
is just very exciting to me.” You
echo that sentiment in your edito-
rial, suggesting that “‘it is a shame
that wecan’thave a Buddhist teach
courses in Zen or a Muslim teach
courses in Islam.”

Indeeditis. But what makesit
ashame isnot that Buddhists should
teach Buddhism, or Muslims teach
Islam, but that anyone should be
free to teach anything. That prin-

ciple, and that principle alone, is”

fully consonant with the liberal
ideals which lie at the heart of the

education offered in institutions
such as Davidson.

To be fair, neither Rosenbach
nor The Davidsonian articulated
the proposition that only Buddhists
should teach Buddhism or Mus-
lims Islam (or, for that matter,
Christians Christianity, or Marx-
ists Marxism, or African-Ameri-
cans African-American history,
etc.). But that argument is often
heard these days in academic
circles, and it would be easy to slip
into the facile assumption that par-
ticular religions, cultures and his-
tories should only be taught by
individuals rooted in and formed
by them.

Such an arugment derives ul-
timately from the conviction that it
is not possible to have “objective”
knowledge of anything. This is
not the place to rehash the debates

over “deconstruction” and “post- ”

modernism,” intellectual move-

- ments which have, in different

ways, sharply limited our capacity
to “know” things for certain, ex-
cept to note that most academics,
myself included, would accept that
proposition that objectivity in
knowledge is impossible.

‘But it seems to me that one
can at least strive for objectivity.
Unless we are to condemn our-
selves to a world of permanent
intellectual and cultural
ghettoization, we must assume that
humans can, inthe struggle toknow
and to learn, rise above the con-
striction of ideologies, theologies,
political conviction and cultural
bias. The effort to be objective, ©
even if doomed, provides the saf-
est means to ensure that open-
mindedness and tolerance and cu-

_. tiosity which, more than anything,

constitute the aims of liberal edu-
cation. 5

fair. Many student organizations
gathered volunteers to work at the
gift fairs. These groups include:
Connor House, FIJI, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Delta Fheta, Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon, Warner Hall, the Women’s

Issues Committee, Intervarsity Stu-
dent Fellowship, Fellowship of
Christian Athletes, Westminster,
and the Methodist Fellowship
group. I extend a very sincere
thank you to all students from these
organizations that contributed to

the fair. And I would also like to
thank Candice Worth for making a
presentation at the Pines and all the
people in the Chaplain’s office for
your outstanding help.
