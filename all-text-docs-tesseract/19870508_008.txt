Sam Ragan iscusses poeiry an DOECTICS

By SUDEEP SEN

Sam Ragan is the poet
laureate of North Carolina. He
was this year’s judge for the Ver-
een Bell Creative Writing Awards
and one the three invitees along
with Georgia Senator Wyche
Fowler and Cyrus Vance at the
Spring Awards Convocation. The
following ‘is a conversation be-
tween Ragan, Professor Anthony
Abbott, the creative writing
teacher at Davidson, and Sudeep
Sen, a student at Davidson who

was the second prize winner of the | |

Vereen Bell this year.

SUDEEP SEN: How does it
feel to be among the students as a
renowned poet laureate?

SAM RAGAN: Well, I never |

really leave the students. I try to
stay in touch with them as often as
possible because I feel that it is

one way of keeping oneself

young. I do some teaching from
time _to*time in various colleges
and universities and lecture as
much as T can. I have two or three

other jobs as an editor, jour-—

nalist, . . ..and of course write

and talk about poetry whenever I

find a freé hour or a free day.
SEN: I have seen here and

back home in my country in India, ]

the growth of'these so-called poe-
tic cliques who, for all practical
purposes, refuse encourage’ any-
one outside their cliques and just
pat each others backs.
’ RAGAN: Unfortunately that
exists, but I don’t feel that exists
in North Carolina. Among the’
writers I know, they are just
pleased at the publication or the
success of a fellow writer as with
their own work. And I am sure
you (Prof.Abbott), have noticed
the same thing.
PROF. ABBOTT: Sure!
RAGAN: You can find these
cliques in places like New York,
Los Angeles, other major cities.

They seem to huddle together and no matter what you write —

freeze out anyone else, but I
haven’t found that in this state or

anywhere in the South.

prose or poetry , because so many
of the major publishing houses are

now part of big corporate con-

‘ poet), to be be recognized? And if it
‘is important, how important are .

the mechanics of the situation?
ABBOTT: There are two dif-

ferent kinds of recognition, na-

tional and regional. It is a lot

easier to get regional recognition.

than national. Writers in the South

. do lot more reading in their area.

Do you think that’s true? : . .
RAGAN: That’s right.
ABBOTT: .. . whereas

these writers may not be well

known in the New York, Boston

or Chicago.

the work. I really think the future
of publishing as. far as creative

writing is in the regional press and |

the academic community. Really
it is here some of the. best works

~ are being produced.

SEN: So, as a poet, how im-

peding do you think is the com-'

mercial world?
RAGAN: Well , unfortunately

I don’ t know any poet can make a

living off poetry and that has been
true through the times. Even
Robert Frost, who was America’ s
number one hit never ‘could

make a living off poetry . . . . He
had a farm, sold real estate and did
a little bit of everything.

SEN: What do you think are
the recent trends in writing? How
do you think has the growth or

“even deviation’ from from a par-
rather than at the true quality of ~

ticular form have been? Do’ you
think it has evolved, where does it
stand now?

RAGAN: I think we have
seen a movement towards realism
in American literature and par-
ticularly poetry in the past quarter
of acentury. I don’t know whether
it is a fad or a long term trend to-.
wards realism. The language is
perhaps more geared to everyday
life. ¥ 2

SEN: Judging from a more
conventional standpoint and the
_ Way poetry is written nowadays
and the way it is going to writ-
ten . . . even snapshots from the
telephone directories or punch
lines from advertisements or films
have been anthologized in poetry
volumes. What are your impres-
sions about these?

RAGAN: I don’ t pay much at-
tention to these. That’s all like

y contemporary paintings. I think if

you take poetry seriously, there
“are guidelines. These modern fads
are not meant to be. taken seri-

i ously. They are obviously. not

poetry, or art.

SEN: Since you have brought
it up, certain people are of the firm
belief that if you write ‘free
verse,’ which is what most people
write in nowadays, you ought to
master the conventional verse
forms. And now what has’ hap-
pened is (both from personal ex-
perience and from the other young
people who write), we being in the
present day society, we have
never written ‘naturally’ in me-
tered and structured verse forms
as we have always seen free verse
ever since we were born. With
that in mind, what do you have to
say to this old school of thought?

- RAGAN: I think we have

gone beyond the strictures of

highly structured poetry. -Xou
must remember that a lot of rhyme
was fad at one time which hap-
pened to have lasted for a long
time. I think most poets have gone
beyond that and I think this is
going tolast,too. _.

SEN: Another trend in poetry
which might be termed as gim-
micks by some. people, bu
nevertheless it is a very important
movement and innovation in writ-
ing. It is the use of visual
* metaphors, In concrete or struc-

turalist poetry, the typographical
arrangement of the poem on paper
is as important as the literary
metaphorical images .

_- RAGAN: . . . but I think that
is secondary, although I see a lot
of that happening and I suppose a
lot of that is due to the presence of
computers and word processors.
SEN: If you really go back to
the people who experimented with
it and. started it, like Guillaume
Apollinaire, a modern European
poet, we learn that he never had a
“Computer, or even May Swen-
son’s Iconographs which rely pur-
ely on visual structure. Do you

think that this is an important
growth in poetry and added sig-
nificantly to the value of poetry? ”

RAGAN: ° I ‘ani ‘not’ ‘sure
whether it has or not. I still think
that substance is more important
than form and these typographical
gymnastics are secondary to the
content. The feeling, the idea, the
choice of words — that is impor-
tant.

SEN: The two other aspects I
was wondering about is ‘mood’ .
and ‘spontaneity’ in poetry. There
are two ways to attempt to write a
poem. One is “the spontaneous
overflow of powerful feelings” as
according to Wordsworth; the
other is a conscious effort to write
everyday and consequently ‘shar-
pen your skills. What are your
views on poetry writing, more so
for poets writing today?

RAGAN: I think each poem
describes its own talent. I think it
was Theodore Roethke who said
that “any poem is more an act of

compulsion than an act of will.”
So I think it’ s really got to start in-
side you and certain! y in. my case,
a poem is written a ng time be-
fore it is committed to paper. It
takes time for the feelings and
ideas to gel, get to the place they
should be. Spontantity is just one
way, you have to wait and let it
happen. I am not sure whether you
sit at 10 o’clock everyday and say
that I am going to write a
poem... you may very well
write something, but it may not be»
very good. I am not sure whether
you can force it.

SEN: I am not sure either, at
“least personally speaking. Though
I know some people who write
very well in spite of writing com- |
pulsively everyday. Of course
they write a lot of bad stuff, but
then they have an enormous vari-
