Just as many com- @

shance to play Ham-
tet, and dance band
musicians to do a stint
with a symphony or-
chestra, sports writers
also find themselves
occasionally wishin g
for a chance to step
out of their own pro-
vince to have a say on
other affairs. So we
hope you'll pardon
this one concession to
impulse while we @
campus  elitice aad By DICK ROPER
the discussion on the bombshell dropped by the Faculty Com-
mittee on Fraternities last Monday night. .

The proposed regulation of that ‘committee which would
require freshmen to take their meals at the new College Union
cafeteria for their entire first year is calculated — whether
or not intentionally — to work a great hardship on all frater-
nities on the campus, and it could well be the death knell for
some of the smaller ones.

TWO MAIN PURPOSES OF PROPOSED RULE

The purposes of this new rule, as we understand it, are
twofold: First, to make the College dining facilities self-suf-
ficient; and second, to foster the growth of something called
“class spirit” and “unity.”

Now it is quite understandable why the College desires
to avoid losing any more money on its dining facilities. We
understand that they have been suffering a considerable loss
on this service in recent months, with only a small number of
students eating in the Dining Hall. Now, it seems, the College
has figured out a way to avoid this loss — at the expense of
the fraternities and their boarding houses.

These boarding houses are, of course, the last thread
which holds fraternities together at Davidson. Except for the
weekly meetings of the Greeks on Thursday nights, there are
no other regular occasions on which all members of the fra-
ternities are gathered together. The College years ago out-
lawed fraternity houses with living quarters, so we have to
resort to the next best thing, which is the boarding house
system.

BOARDING HOUSES NEED FRESHMEN

The only thing that makes these boarding houses oper-
able at a reasonable fee to the individual members of the fra-
ternities is the presence of a large group. Without freshmen,
many of these boarding houses could no longer operate with-
out charging an intolerable amount. So it seems pretty clear
that if this proposed change in the College rules is approved
by the Board of Trustees when it meets Feb. 18, the hand-
writing is on the wall for many fraternities.

Now, as we have said, we recognize the fact that the Col-
lege is having a tough time financially. But is it fair to impose
this burden on the fraternities? Should it have the power
to make a freshman pay board to it, whether or not he wants
to eat cafeteria food, in a room with two hundred people
milling around? The College at present can compel students
to be present at classes, chapel, and vespers. But it seems a
little too overbearing to dictate to a boy the place he must take
his meals for his whole first year in college.

IS “CLASS SPIRIT” NECESSARY?

The avowed purpose of fostering “class spirit” anu
“unity” may sound somewhat worthwhile at first. But just
what is “class spirit”? The phrase implies rivalry. Rivalry be-
tween, or among, whom? For what purpose? Is this a neces-
sary thing? Necessary for what? Why should the Class of ’53
be “better” than the Class of 54? School spirit and fraternity
spirit we can understand. “Class spirit” not only sounds gram-
mar schoolish but completely unnecessary.

But whatever the purposes or potential effects of this pro-
posed change may be, the fact remains that if it is to be defeat-
ed, the impetus will have to come from the student body. If
the students want to give up at the start, the measure will
almost certainly be passed. The College, in its wisdom, has
evidently decided this is the best thing for Davidson, and the
Trustees will probably approve it unless the student body,
through letters and actual discussions with the members of
the Board, can show them what its real effect will be and
convince them that the change is undesirable.

as Coach Charlie Parker’s grap-
plers go after their first win to-
morrow afternoon at 2:30 in John:

Both squads have met Carolina,
with Carolina eking out a win over
the Wildcats, while Duke beat
Carolina, so it looks as if the Wild.
cats may be in for a lot of grunts
and groans.

KEY BACK AT 123 LBS.

Bobby Joe Key, a flashy sopho-
more grappler and a_ holdover
from last year’s squad will wrestle
in the 123 pound division. Getting
the assignment in the 130 pound
division will be Charlie Murray.
Either Ron Reid, junior holdover,
or newcomer Hugh Neisler will
handle the 137 pound competition.

Most experienced of the David-
son wrestlers ts senior Gene Crav-
en who will be the Wildcat entry
in the 147 pound class. Handling
the duties in the 157 pound divi-
sion will be John Buxton, a sopho

liance. Bill Coe is the Wildcats’
man in the 167 pound class.

A fading Wildcat quintet will go into action against South

The tusste with the South Caro-

the Cats who face The Citadel on
Saturday night in Charleston and
then return to face a strong Ten-
nessee club on the Johnston Gym
boards on Monday night.

South Carolina, which faced
State Wednesday night with a 7-8
record, had won three in a row at
that point. Their most recent SC
victims were Furman and Clemson.

* The Gamecocks are led by their
senior center Johnny Peterson
who had been averaging over 16
points a game in the 15 game
string before the State encounter.
The other four starters for South
Carolina are all freshmen and so-
phomores as Coach Frank John-
son’s team is in a building year.

Saturday's opponent, The Cit-
adel, has faced Southern Confer-
ence opposition six times this sea-

soundly beaten. The Cats hope to
keep things this way when the two
teams meet for the first time this
year.

King Leaves School,
Will Go To Ohio

Davidson lost half of its top
scoring combination this week
when Guard Jerry King with-
drew from school. King plen-
ned to transfer to a college in
his native Ohio.

King averaged a little over
14 points per game for 11
games this year. He and cen-
ter Joe Dudley were the only
consistent scoring combina-
tion the Cats had.

King plans to enter either
the University of Cincinnati or
Ohio State University. Jerry
has been contemplating the
move for some time because
he wanted to go to school a
little closer to his native Ham-
ilten, Ohio. He will play bas-
ketball if he can, but that was
not his reason for the mid-
year transfer.

Coach Danny Miller has not
yet decided on any permanent
replacement for King. He will
try freshman Hobby Cobb in
the guard slot, but plans to
keep shifting his lineup till he
finds a workable combination.

KAs Remain Undefeated As
Season Hits Halfway Mark

By BUCK REINHARDT

The Kappa Alpha five continued
to display their superior talent in
the past week's interfraternity bas-
ketball action. The KA’s now are
the only team to possess a perfect
record, having five victories with-
out a defeat tucked under their
belt.

However, the Phi Delts are put-
ting the pressure on the KA's for
the honor of first place, by gaining
undisputed possession of second
place with victories over the Pi
Kapps and Kappa Sigs in the re-
cent action.

These wins gave the Phi Delts
five victories with only one de-
feat, and put the Phi Delts in posi
tion to sneak into first place
through the backdoor.

Catlish Host To ROTO Marksmen Set

This Atternoon

Coach Carroll Hambright’s Cat-

when they took on N. C. State here
this afternoon.

Hambright believes his team is
in better shape than it was last
week when it was defeated by
Carolina. Charlie Hull has improv-
ed considerably over his previous
performances and was set to take
over the brunt of the work in this
department.

Jim Bryan, who has been handi-
capped with a cold for some time,
was expected to be in top shape
for this afternoon’s event.

Al Ormond swam his fastest
laps of the year in last Tuesday’s
practice session, and was expected
to place high in that event this
afternoon.

Among the freshmen swimmers,
Bo Abern.thy has made outstand-
ing progress in cutting lis time,
while Phil Hicks and Larry Par.
rott have recently slashed their
old marks.

The next meet for the Catfish
swimmers will be with South Caro-
lina next Tuesday. The USC team
beat Hambright's charges in their
first meeting of the season.
