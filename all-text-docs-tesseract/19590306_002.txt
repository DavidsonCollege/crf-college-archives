THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGES

Should Davidson

It is inevitable that the students,
faculty, and trustees of Davidson
must face the question, “Will Negro
students be admitted to the College?”
The final decision of this matter may
have to come this year, or it might be
delayed for ten years, but it will cer-
tainly have to come.

During our four years on campus
such a possibility has been discussed
only in a low voice, and then behind
locked doors. As is the case through-
out the South today, concerning the
race question, both students and
faculty have seemed afraid to face
the question openly and express opin-
ions.

We think the time has come to
end such ostrich-headed attitudes.
Why not consider the possibility?
Why not honestly try to find out what
effects there might be if a qualified
Negro student enrolled at the Col-
lege?

As we consider the problem, our
first emotional reaction is to recoil
from the thought, but when we search
for a reasonable excuse for not admit-
ting Negroes, we find ourselves at a
loss. The College would not collapse.
Instruction would certainly go on. If
the student were fully. qualified, aca-
demic standards would not suffer.
Actually, no one at Davidson would
know the difference.

The most serious problems would
come to the Negro student himself.
His social life would be cramped, fi-
nances strained, perhaps, to meet the
high cost of a Davidson education. It

Admit Negroes?

is, frankly, rather difficult to under-
stand just why a Negro would want
to come here. However, if he did, and
if he were qualified, we cannot see
any legitimate reason for not admit-
ting him as a student with all
privileges and opportunities for ac-
quiring an education.

Such action would meet with the
full approval of the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian Church, the ulti-
mate policy-setting organization of
the College.

Our attitude on the subject of Ne-
groes at Davidson may be the highest
type of heresy, and we would be the
first to admit that our natural inclina-
tion is to disagree, even with our-
selves. Yet, any defenses erected to
keep qualified Negro students out of
Davidson must be based on such
flimsy arguments that they seem to
be rationally untenable.

At any rate, now is the time to be-
gin to think about the issues involved.
It would be better to know something
about the matter when the time comes
to face a decision than to have to act
blindly, using subjective emotional
beliefs as our only materials for ac-
tion.

The DAVIDSONIAN does not wish
to suggest that we have presented all
the aspects of this matter, or that we
have the final answers. No one could
when such intricate issues are in-
volved. Therefore, the pages of this
paper will be open to anyone wish-
ing to express an opinion on this is-
sue, regardless of what that opinion
may be.

Kuykendall’s Record: A Challenge
To The New Administration

The students have made their

choice, and Dee Green has been
elected President of the Student Body
for 1959-60.

. He faces the most. challenging and
demanding year in the recent history .
of the Student Council. and the effect
of his leadership next year will help
determine the place of the Council
in student life for some time to come.

Furthermore, his actions as head
of student government will inevitably
be held up for comparison with those
of this year’s president. John Kuyken-
dall’s record as Student Body Presi-
dent will not be an easy one to match.

He has been the main force be-
hind constitutional changes that: will
remain on the books for a long time
to come, and as a result of his efforts,
an entirely new branch of student
government is about to come into be-
ing.

Not only has Kuykendall steered
the Honor Court, the elections amend-
ment, and the abolition of firearms
through the devious channels of stu-
dent approval — he has also set an

example for future presidents by his
quiet, unostentatious, but purposive
and determined way of handling the
business of the Student Council.

Kuykendall’s successor will have
a high standard to measure up to, and
he will also have to face wholly new
and unfamiliar demands rising out of
nature of the situation in which next
year’s Council will find itself. In the
past, the Student Council’s judicial
function Has to g large extent defined
its general oses and the attitudes
of its members.

This judicial function now will re-
side in another organization, and the
Student Council is in imminent dan-
ger of becoming a figurehead on cam-
pus, a refuge for “good guys” who
can get elected to office but whose
positive contribution to student life
is nil.

Whether this happens or not will
be the responsibility of President Dee
Green, his fellow officers, Jim Bootle,
Verner Stanley, and D. G. Martin,
and their colleagues on the Student
Council.—C.H.C.

Other Side Of The Coin

So much has been said about the
great god Conformity, who received
a few more punches during the re-
cent Winter Services, that another of
the ‘Barriers’ on which the speakers
for the Service spoke has been built
on the foundations of Conformity.

We hear so much about conformi-
ty that we are very willing, yea, even
desirous, to go along with the crowd..
“Everybody’s doing it,” so, if we can
attain the standard of the masses,

we are ‘in.’

So we suggest that critics shift
their blows from conformity to com-
placency. As Dr. Russell chose to put
it, we might say “Don’t Park Here.”
Press beyond your present attain-
ments; press on beyond the crowd.
Dare to be different. This sounds like
_the other side of the coin that says
“Don’t Conform,” but at least it will
‘have a different ring —G.W.R.

EUROPEAN FREE TRADE MAY BE ANSWER

Foreign Student Comments On Scandinavian Economics

By WILLI BARENTHIN

An economic cooperation be-
tween the Scandinavian coun-
tries seems to be quite natural
for geographical reasons alone,
but also considering the com-
mon historical background and
the strong cultural relations. In
recent years serious efforts
shave been made to realize this
project.

In 1952 the Nordic Council
was established, sponsored by
the governments in the coun-
tries concerned: Denmark, Nor-
way, Finland, and Sweden. Ac-
cording to the Council’s Report
from October 21, 1957, the

should embrace 80 per cent of
the Nordic trade, thus exclud-
ing agricultural commodities
and those produced by the fish-
ing industry and by the textile
and shoe manufacturers.

The Nordic market, accord-
ing to the Report, should be a
tariff union with a common cus-
toms tariff to protect the area
from other countries. A close
collaboration is desired in the
production of iron, steel, auto-
mobiles, electric power, ma-
chinery, and construction ma-
terials and also in the fields of
research and education.

EUROPEAN PLAN
At the same time, however,

¢

similar forces began to work
on the European continent. In-
stitutions like the European
Council, the OEEC, and the
Coal and Steel Union, soon to
become the Euratom, attempt-
ed to unify Europe — or parts
of it — cconomically and po-
litically.

Countries with trade inter
ests on the Western European
continent watched this develop-
ment with anxiety, Great Bri-
tain in particular and quite na-
turally the Scandinavian coun-
tries. Great Britain in 1956 pro-
posed the establishment of a
general European free-trade
area, keeping the different

German Writer Describes And
Criticizes The Campus “Beast”

By Erns!-Helge Schoenfelder

Have you seen it? Can you
recognize it? The everpresent
phenomenon that surrounds
you, dominates you, links you
with your fellow beings and
gives you external security. To
you it is the perfume that
sweetens the daily Hfe just as
you sweeten the pickles to es-
cape their sourness. To others
it is like the stench of a skunk
that sticks to you, an odour of
which only a few of you have
been capable of ridding your-
Selves.

Changing its colors accord-
ing to the demand of the situa-
tion, thus forming a_ perfect
mimicry, it still remains the
same beast, lounging in the
warm moisture of: complac-
ency.

wherever you go. You may
be made to accept it with a
shrugging of your shoulders,

or it may arouse your opposi-
tion, piling up tension after
tension within you. And yet,
the beast is so friendly, it
even smiles, and greets you
with a “Hi” and “How are
you?”

It is personified in two little
straps held together by a piece
of metal; you may call it the
embodiment of the beast. You
may find it in the rhythm de-
scended from African tribal
concerts and in the schmaltz
music that fill the dormitory
or fraternity house like stink-
ing sulphuric fumes, stifling
the occasional visitor and in-
evitably stimulating abrupt
muscular resctions and jerking
limbs of those who live in these
melodious sulphur clouds.

how you can stand the odour
of this beast of gregarious-
ness except that you love it.

| have come to believe that
this, in fact, is true.

You support -and feed it
whenever you can, and it
blooms under your care. You
sacrifice your thoughts, ideas,
feelings, words to it without
realizing that, at the same time,
you are giving up the qualities
that make you an individual.

You always dedicate your
words and thoughts to the
same subjects, to the sweet-
sour reactions of candy and
,lemon that girls can arouse in
you, to the mass consumption
of dry pap before exam days,
the jelly-Jike vanity produced
by grades, and the intoxi-
cating incense of success.

These are only a few of the
fares with which you keep your
beast alive so that .it may con-

Call For Girls And ‘New God”

Dear Editor:

Your article on the “satis-
fied freshmen” in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN is a complete
farce. I am probably the most
unsatisfied freshman east of
the Catawba River. With your
permission I would like to voice
a few suggestions which might
satisfy me.

WANTS GIRLS

I was overjoyed to hear about
the construction of a new
dormitory. However, I was sor-
ry to hear about the occupants
— males, Davidson has been
unoriginal before, but this
beats all. Every dorm on cam-
pus at present is crammed with
males. It's about time we did

ourselves a favor and to put
Davidson in the headlines of
national and international pa-
pers at the same time. Let’s
put girls in that new dorm.

Just think of the tremendous
boost in morale; the student
council wouldn’t have to worry
sbout student body spirit any
more. This would also eliminate
all the extra trouble of getting
girls here for dance weekends.
In fact, we could have dance
weekends every weekend.

Our academic accomplish-
ments might plunge to unpre-
cedented depths, but grooming
and manners on campus would
reach a new height. Also, if
girls attended classes, there

would be no desire for unlimit-
ed cuts at all.

APPOINT A GOD

Finally, I wish somebody
would appoint a new God for
Davidson. Thus far, acts of our
God have prevented the Four
Freshmen, Vincent Price, and
the Kingston Trio from fulfill-
ing their obligations to our cul-
ture-starved campus community.
With all student council elec-
tions over. a campaign for the
office of God would keep the
vote-hungry big wheels busy

countries’ national tariffs to-
ward outside nations. This plan
was supported by Denmark,
Norway, Finland, and Sweden.
So far, however, no final re-
conciliation has been made pos-
sible.
SWEDEN'S ROLE

Sweden has been actively en-
gaged in the work of the OEEC,
since 70 per cent of its exports
go to Western Europe. The pro-
ductivity of this action is of
a vital importance to Sweden,
as a third of these exports
would go to the Euratom area
and would be met by high
tariffs.

The free-trade area would in-
clude about 300 million people

in 17 countries with a high to-
tal industrial capacity. Will the
Nordic union become part of
it by abolishing the remaining
20 per cent of restrictions? It
is hard to tell. It certainly
would not be very popular
among Swedish farmers, who
are dependent upon high
tariffs.

It might, though, prove ad-
vantageous to the Scandinavian
countries to join the free-trade
area, since the Nordic union — ¢
which would not be deserted —
would increase the competitive
power of the four nations in-
volved in it by being a separate
force within the great unity.

Ocasionally, even the Davidson gentleman longs to
leave his lair, our own dear pinnacle of collegiate per-
fection, and thus it happened that Godfrey Cringe, Boris
Treadway, and I sallied forth to the Queen City the other
night to view the cinema. “The Old Man and the Sea”
was our choice. I had my apprehensions as to Hollywood's
ability to refrain from re-writing Hemingway, half-way
expecting to see Jayne Mansfield inserted into the story
as a Cuban mermaid, but I was agreeably surprised.

Except for a few technical hitches in the scene where
the Old Man battles the marlin, the film was a master-
piece, capturing enough of Hemingway’s artistry to make
it so. Just as entertaining were the reactions of a few
fellow citizens who sat near us in the theatre. I am think-
ing specifically of a small, rather moist and vocal child
who had journeyed in from Suburbia with his parents.

For the greater portion of the performance, he was
content to sit quietly imitating B-29’s, but he grew tired
of this and decided to widen his repertoire to include
skylarks and Russian wolf-hounds. His mother held him in
check with annotative comments such as: “Look, Georgie,
the man is going to catch a fish” or “see the man’s hands

bleeding, Georgie!”

Near the picture’s end, when the Old Man was going
home at night through the streets of the village, he
stumbled and fell in front of a church; at this disturbance,
a rather degenerate looking alley-cat was shown fleeing

from a garbage can.

With the insight of a true scientist, Georgie shrieked,
“Kitty!” “That’s right,” his mother said proudly and she
elbowed her husband in the kidney to notify him of his
son’s keen mind. Apparently overcome by his own bril-
liance, Georgie was content to spend the rest of the time
gnawing on the arm-rest of his seat.

Despite these minor disturbances, everyone seemed
to have enjoyed the movic, except one woman whom I
overheard complaining about the lack of dancing and
pretty costumes. We stopped for milk and pretzels be-
fore coming back to school, and I decided that the Specta-
tor should recommend the movie to other Davidson gentle-
men. I thought about how good the book was, clean and
hard, and wondered if the Army would hit the moon
with a rocket and what it would prove if they did.

THE PHILOSOPHES
Modern Preacher

Calls For Funds

By DABNEY STUART

It was the Sunday before
Every-Member-Canvass Week
and the preacher was kicking
it off. Up there in the pulpit,
sweeping the air with his black
sleeve, he talked about steward-
ship, and the need to tithe.

“Where your treasure is
is exactly where your heart is
going to be. Put the bulk of
your money in the country
club and the bulk of your
interest, energy, and time
will be spent there, too.

“Invest the major portion of
your income in the stock mar-
ket and you'll read the stock
report sheet in the morning pa-
per instead of the Bible.

“Wherever you put the fruit
of your labor, there you will
find the root of your concern.”

He filled the pauses between
his phrases and examples with
piercing looks and surging mo-
tions. The very wind of spirit
seemed to swell the sails of his

urgency. His manner was i
sharp contrast with that of the
chairman of the drive, who ha/d
delivered the layman’s Pia
just before the preacher hdd
mounted the bridge.

“I ask you to consider the
plece of your church in your
life. tf it isn’t at the center,
then one way of helping to
place it there is to be certain
of your tithe.

“I do not ask you to tithe for
the sake of your church, but
for the sake of yourself. The
church needs your tithe to
exist, of course, but that is the
by-product of the tremendous
good you can do for yourself,

“Put yourself in the center
of the .church, and the church
in the center of your life, by
putting your treasure in the
church.”

The sermon was liberally
sprinkled with illustrations
of men who hed given large
portions of their incomes to
the church of God, and had
felt the corresponding resurg-
ence of life. Some had even
gone to the extreme of giving
every penny.

“Fill yourself with giving,”
the preacher said, and closed
with a prayer.

As the congregation rose to
sing God's praise the sun slant-
ing through the stained-glass
windows glinted on one of the
diamond earrings the preach-
er’s wife was wearing.
