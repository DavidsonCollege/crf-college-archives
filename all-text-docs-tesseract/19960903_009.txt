“Better one suffer, than a nation
grieve.” -Dryden

A great patriot, wasn’t he? If I
liked patriotism, I would be really
impressed by that passionate dec-
laration of love for country. I bet a
lot of you are Davidson patriots.
You probably love your little town
so much you want to burst. I don’t
feel that way about where I live.
But, alas, (sigh) I live in Cornelius.

It took a long time for me to be
able to say that. Not that Cornelius
is a bad place, it is a very funny
place actually. I just hate the word
Cornelius so much.Why would
someone name a town Cornelius?
I suppose the obvious reason is
that it was the founding father’s

name. Cornelius is your basic Ro-
man name, but that does not make
it a pretty sound. There is some-
thing about a name that aspires to
evoke greatness and civic pride
and falls so short that is a bit charm-
ing. In a sick way. To a sick and
sarcastic person such as myself.
We tried to live in Davidson,
but RLO prevented that with some
sorry lottery numbers. Our previ-
ous landlord was more emphatic
about his refusal. to accomodate
our request for another year on
Watson Street. We don’t miss him.
So, we were relegated to Cornelius.
For a while, when asked that ever-
so-popular, “Where do you live?”
I replied, “Behind Blockbuster.”
That sounded even worse and was

Reunion 2046

Following is an excerpt from
a piece written by Dean of Fac-
ulty, Robert C. Williams which ran
in the Spring 1996 Davidson Jour-
nal.

Those of us who returned to
Davidson for our 50th reunion in
2046 were few in number, survi-
vors in our “global maturity.” As
the reading of names of our de-

’ ceased indicated, AIDS, the Ebola
virus, and the mad cow epidemic
have all taken their toll in recent
years. The disastrous decline in
global sperm count reduced our
legacies to Davidson even further.
Nevertheless, we were glad to see
each other and to revisit the
Cornelius-Lincolnton-Kannapolis
Research Triangle once more after
so many years.

Davidson, you will be pleased
to know, remains a nationally
ranked small liberal arts college of
14,000 students, nearly 40 in resi-
dence. Thecollege’s beloved State-
ment of Productivity which we re-
vised 50 years ago is still in place.
Tuition remains under $1 million
per year, again paralleling closely
the cost of anew mid-size helicop-
ter.

... The staff has been greatly
reduced from its peak of 75,000 a
few years back and have, at any
rate, all been promoted to facilita-
tors, so that our U. S. News and
World Report ranking has stayed
high.

The donation of 400 acres of
artificial turf by a former golf coach
eliminated 86 groundskeeper po-
sitions ... Combining the religion
and athletic departments into a
single department of entertainment
would have kept the athletic bud-

get below 92 percent of the operat-.

ing budget overall if the merger
had not required raising the bas-
ketball floor another three feet fur-
ther toward heaven ...

The most puzzling thing about
the reunion was the large number
of stories we heard about the great
Duke Power Blackout, the day a
few years back when power fail-
ures and a solar eclipse, together
with electronic pulses from the
Chilean nuclear attack on Peru,
completely zapped the IT infra-
structure of the college.

For a period of many months
students and facilitators discov-
ered that they were once again
compelled by the failure of tech-
nology to engage in a moral enter-
prise of learning and teaching
grounded in faith. The relation-
ship with the Presbyterian Church
UN was renegotiated. Task forces
on athletics sprang up again like
mushrooms, struggling with the
old division 21 or 23 questions.
Humanities instructors took ‘over
the campus classroom. There were
real conversations — face-to-face
interactions, as we called them —
about topics discussed in the books
which had escaped The Burning.

... The library ceased for a
while to be a Museum of Curricu-
lum and ‘became a place where
students actually read books and

conversed with their facilitators ...

Most remarkable was that the
banned politically incorrect key-
words began to appear on campus
— mission, purpose, character,
honor, community, warmth, love,
humane instincts, wisdom, ethics,
values, friendship, commitment. I
must say [had not seen those words
in the home page for years, ever
since the old Honor System gave
way to the Information Sharing
and Caring Team...

And one more thing; if you’ re
interested in learning more about
Reunion and the Great Blackout,
there is lots more on our reunion
home page. It’s under GSD, for
“God Save Davidson.”

Dispel the rumors. Write for opinions.

Corntown Shuffle

almost always followed by, “In
Cornelius?” To which I had to
choke out, “Yes.”

So, I live behind Blockbuster
in Cornelius. I have a pool and
tennis courts and a weight room. I
also have neighbors. And they have
kids, and the kids have bikes and
the bikes have training wheels and
that is frustrating when you are late
to class and the sea of children will
not part.

Inspired by the sheer number
of children, I tried to figure out the
demographics of my living ar-
rangements. I finally did so with
the help of a fellow Cornelian and
friend who lives at the other apart-
ment complex in Cornelius. With
her help, I discovered that she lived

in the swingin’ singles apartments
(Alta Harbor) and I lived in a half-
way house for lake-bound families
whose homes are not yet finished
(One Norman Square). You prob-
ably didn’t even know there was a
singles scene in Cornelius. I didn’t
and I was happy without that
knowledge.

I am not being entirely fair to
Cornelius, or, as it is sometimes
euphemistically referred to, Lake
Norman. It can be a rocking good
time. For example, after tiring of a
party in Davidson, a friend and I
went to a bar in Cornelius. We met
some people who asked us a lot of
questions and drank five drinks to
our one. Another incident of fun
being had in Cornelius was re-

THE MANY MOODS OF BOB DOLE

ported by one of my roommates.
She heard a snappy and interpre-
tive rendition of “Bust a Move” on
karaoke night at the Tropicana.
With the tragic demise of
Backstreet, Cornelius could be the
answer. Hell, you can all sleep at
our place. Just kidding. |

So what if Cornelius does not
satisfy my aesthetic need. With my
postmodern propensity for anti-
cool, I have embraced Corntown
as my (very temporary) home. So,
So, I'm waiting in vain for the tee-
shirt that reads “London, Paris,
Rome, Cornelius.”

At Wake Forest, every dorm

each room has two computer plug-

And what do we pay for this?
The cheapest housing available, a
triple, goes for $1,075 a semester.
Students living in the senior apart-
ments are shelling out $1865 a
semester.

guess,” suggests another UNCC
student.

Well, here: at little, uppity,

character building going on in

At least we don’t go to the
