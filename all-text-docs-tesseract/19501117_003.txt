Hang Your Hat
At Hugo's

By NAT DANIELS

The reception of the letter which
follows fired the sparks for me to
begin an undertaking long planned
and never realized: a city column
for the Davidsonian, and so I be-
gin, not without some apprehen-
sions, to try to help our student
body to remember that for nine
months of the year they are the
adopted citizens of Mayor Beaty’s
Metropolis, the second largest in-
corporated town in Mecklenburg
County.

To the City Editor of the Da-

vidsonian:
Dear Sir:

Since the college term began in
September, I have been consider-
ably annoyed and even frightened
by the carelessness of a minority
of the students who own automo-
biles, who have not been properly
trained in their use.

Tt was also brought to my at.
tention that several of our more
elderly citizens have been peculiar.
ly endangered by these more
childish drivers, in particular a red
roadster bearing a Georgia dealer’s
license, indentified by a student as
a 1950 Plymouth.

I feel that some action should be
taken concerning the irresponsi-
bility of this car’s driver, for though
several students have demonstrat.
ed their ability to handle their cars,
this red monstrosity has prevented
me and my friends from venturing
from the comparative safety of our
homes except on rare occasions.

I would like for you to investi.
gate this case for me. and publish
a report in the Davidsonian, for it
concerns the safety of our town’s
citizens, especially those who either
have not reached the age of dis-
cretion, and those who no longer
have their youthful agility.

Thanking you for your kind con.
sideration in this matter, I remain

Sincerely yours,
Miss Prudence Ann
. Temperance.

And so I investigated Miss Tem.
perance’s complaint, and find that
not only she, but several other good
citizens of North Carolina and her
good neighbors, Virginia ‘and Ten-
nessee, not excluding some mem.
bers of the faculty and student
body, have been trying to discover
the why and wherefore surround.
ing the misuse of our friend’s red
Plymouth, and so in all due de-
ference and respect to its driver, I
present the following facts for your
perusal:

Mecklenburg and Iredell county
police records show:

1. Apprehension and a reprimand
in Cornelius for speeding. No ex-
cuse.

2. Reprimand i: Davidson for
endangering pedestrian’s with ex
cessive speed, in this instance a
member of the Davidson Police
department. Excuse: Sleepy—too
early in the mornin x.

3. A complimentary from the towr
of. Mooresville for overtime park.
ing. Excuse: No small change.

State police records also show:

1. Arrest for passing a stopped
school bus on opposite side of “
four lane highway. Excuse: No
children in sight.

2. Arrest in Statesville for speed-
ing in excess of 65 miles per hour.
and resisting arrest. Excuse No. 1,
thought plain clothes policeman
was a hot-rod enthusiast who want-
ed to race. Excuse No. 2, radio was
turned up so loud the siren was
inaudible.

Latest encounter: Scene: Bristol
—U. I. C. Bristol police note red
Plymouth convertible stopped on
shoulder of main traffic artery.
and upon being informed that there
was no car trouble involved, re-
quested that the driver move on.
Time: 10:00 p. m. Excuse: .No side
roads available.

For the benefit of Miss Temper.
ance, I took my findings to mem.
bers of the Psychology department
for an analysis, and they came up
with the following analysis:

Our subject's reaction is similar
to that of a young child playing
with a new toy which was origin-
ally developed for more mature
children, and they go on to say that
this phobia can be cured only by
the sobering of years. However
they declined to make any state-
ment concerning the law of aver-

MEMBERSHIP DRIVE STARTED BY SIGMA DELTA PSI

Davidson's chapter of Sigma
Delta Psi, national honorary ath-

letic fraternity, under the direction

of president Bill Pritchett an-

nounced this week its plans for ex-

panded activity this year.

The Davidson chapter, eighth in
the country in membership last ‘year
and fifth the ‘year before, hopes
through an expanded membership

drive to capture first place in mem.

bership in the United States this
year. Sigma Delta Psi is fast be.
coming one of the more important
honorary fraternities on the Da-
vidson Campus.

Several social functicus will be
held during the yeas mot promi-
nent of which will be an initiation
banquet in the spring in honor of
new initiates.

Sigma Delta Psi had eighteen
brothers at Davidson last year and
those back this year include Prit-
chett, Tommy Haller, vice-president,
Joe Miller, secretary-treasurer, Ken
Goodpasture, Bruce Ballenger, Ed
West, Murry Remson, Bob Turk,
Fred Spach, Al Cook, Andy Horne,
and Don Lazenby. Pete Whittle is
a faculty brother and advisor to the
chapter.

The membership requirements
for Sigma Delta Psi are true tests
of a good athlete and are intended
as a challenge to the boys to prove
themselves as a well-rounded ath-
lete. Besides a challenge for the
candidate to prove himself, it is a
challenge to bring honor to the
school and chapter.

Most work on passing member-
ship requirements usually comes
in the spring. This spring larger em-
phasis will be placed on gaining

‘In a letter received recently, Char-

As for his studies at Oxford,
Charlie is taking, mainly, modern
history courses. with emphasis on
the Medieval Period and English
history. He is working toward a
B. A. Honors degree in History.
Under the Oxford system students
attend lectures voluntarily, do most
of their work on their own, and,
confer frequently with their tutors.

There is a major interest in poli-
tics at Oxford. Charlie reports that
he has joined a socialist, 2 conser-
vative, and a labor party. He was
asked to join a communist party
but refused.

This week I'l! have to admit thar

I've been wanting to do for a long

a fellow named George Shearing.

the blind English pianist whe
came to this country from England
about two years ago. While in Env
land he had a little combo called
the George Shearing Trio, consist.
ing of piano, bass and drums. They
recorded for London Records and
it was for them that they made
what I believe to be their best
record to date, a Gershwin tune
called “Someone To Watch Over
Me.”

After coming to this country he
increased the size of the combo to
a quintet adding a vibraphone and
guitar and almost from the time he
arrived he was a hit as evidenced
by the multitude of better night
spots he has been playing ever
since,

One look at the line-up of in-
struments used in the quintet and
you'll see that his is not what one

Too Young to Die

One of every 12,500 Baltimoreans

As usual, college ‘age drivers made
up an abnormally high proportion
of those involved.

Why this should be—why those
drivers in ‘the prime of life. the
most alert and theoretically most
intelligent drivers, with the most
to live for—is a question plauins
traffic experts. But we ali see either
the potential or the occurence of
one of those accidents nearly every
weekend.

slightly less dangerous than a tank;
the one-arm, go-90 cowboys—we

forget about them. It’s the next
morning that we miss them, when

128 Historic Years

War I. It was purchased from a
New York firm, the FE. Howard
