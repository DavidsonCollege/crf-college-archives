JEFF GEORGE, EDITOR OF THE 1973-74 ANNUAL
The school annual slated to arrive during the first week of the
school has been delayed. The holdup has been attributed mainly to
financial and arganizational difficulties.

Alternatives In Christian Service

By HUGH MOORE
Contributing Editor

(Ed. note: This article is the
second in a two-part series on
Davidson's Christian com-
mitment. Last week the faculty
tenure requirement was
examined. Today’s article deals
with other expressions of this
commitment.)

One way Davidson College ex-
presses its Christian com-
mitment is through a
requirement which stipulates
that all tenured faculty mem-
bers be Christians.

However, discussion of this
very requirement has caused
both supporters and opponents
of it to realize that Christian
commitment means much more
than this.

A resolution calling for the
deletion of the restriction, pro-
posed by Professor of Religion
Alexander J. McKelway, was
before both the faculty and the
Board of Trustees, when the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) presented a second
resolution last May.

The EPC resolution
questioned the tenure policy, as
did the earlier proposal, but it
also called for a reexamination
of Davidson's entire Christian
commitment.

‘‘We feel that increased ef-
forts are needed by trustees,
faculty members, and students,
acting in consultation with each
other, to find new and effective
ways of expressing the historic
commitment of the college to
the Christian faith,” the EPC
said.

The Faculty Executive Com-
mittee and the officers of the
Board of Trustees met on May
31, in response to the resolution,
and agreed to enlarge the group

discussing Christian com-
mitment to include the Faculty
Religious Policy and Program
Committee (FRPPC), Chair-
man of the Trustee Committee
on Religious Policy and
Program G. Don Davidson Jr.
and Minister to Students Rush

Otey.

They also agreed to ask the
FRPPC to prepare a report on
the expression of Davidson's
Christian commitment on the
college campus.

The FRPPC responded by
preparing a memorandum at
their July 24 meeting which
identified five broad areas in
which the Christian witness of
the college should or could be
manifested: celebration or
worship, giving or stewardship,
discipline or study, fellowship,
and relationship to the church
and the larger Christian com-
munity.

Several members of the ad-
ministration and _ faculty
responded to this memoran-
dum, pointing out particular
concerns in the general outline.

“As we undertake to make
the college’s Christian com-
mitment more explicit and ap-
parent,’”” FRPPC member J.
Harris Proctor said, ‘‘we must
take care not to create the im-
pression that there is some

standard form of essing
this commitment * which
everyone here ought to adopt.

“‘A person who chooses to ex-
press his Christian com-
mitment through the giving of
services, for example, rather
than through regular par-
ticipation in systematic public
worship programs should not be
considered a delinquent or in-
ferior member of the com-
munity,”’ Proctor added.

1973 Yearbook Arrival
Set For November 11th

By ANDY LAMAS
Contributing Editor
When will the annual arrive?

Several weeks ago no one on
campus could have responded
to this question. Finally we
have an answer.

‘‘We have just recently
reached an agreement with the
American Yearbook Company
and have been assured that the
annual will arrive the week of
Nov. 11th,’ promises Jeff
George, editor for the 1974 an-
nual.

Last year's staff planned for
the annual to arrive during the
first week of this school year.

“There's really no good ex-
cuse for the annual being three
months late, and I had nothing
to do with it.

“I have been elected to put
out the 1974 annual, and I can
assure you it will be out on time,
possibly in the spring of this
school year,’’ commented
George.

In the past, annuals were

Another committee member,
Professor of English Charles E.
Lloyd, commented on the item
on Christian vocation in the
memorandum. ‘‘We ought in
every way we can to express
our conviction that a man’s
character is more important
than his career, and must con-
cern him before his career can
be anything.

“‘We probably overemphasize
outward achievement in awar-
ding honorary degrees, and we
need to honor more people
whose victories have been those
of the spirit.’’ Lloyd cited Mr.
Whitlow the wheelaligner and
Mr. McKissick the cobbler as
examples.

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry, in commenting on the
memorandum, failed to see
very much of the Christian
spirit on the Davidson campus.
‘*There is more smallness, back
biting,’ mistrust (sometimes
justified), petty gossip,
malicious rumor, and literal
emnity than at any time in my
eleven years of recent
association at Davidson,’ he
said.

“It involves the treatment of
faculty and administration and
staff with one another,”’ he con-
tinued. “It is inter-
administration. It is inter-
faculty. It transcends both
groups.

“It involves student's treat-
ment of one another, and
student treatment of the
faculty, though students are
less involved than others. Oc-
casionally, thankfully it is only
occasionally, I fear it involves
faculty treatment of students.

“Until we resolve this mat-
ter,"’ Terry insisted, ‘‘all the
committee meeting programs,
pamphlets and words will be
sounding brass and tinkling
cymbal.”

Terry notwithstanding, the
Joint Committees met again on
July 27. They discussed the FR-
PPC memorandum and agreed
that the group should be further
enlarged to include Minister of

always distributed during the
spring quarter of each year.
The tradition was altered when
Ron Connelly became the an-
nual editor.

‘Until 1971, when Ron
became editor for the 1972 an-
nual, it had been policy to get
the annual out during the
spring,’’ stated Business
Manager Robert A. Currie.

Some of the annual staff’s
problems can be traced to
financial difficulties.

‘“We need to look at the whole
annual financing policy and see
what’s going on. I don’t un-
derstand it, and I don't know
who does,’’ complains Dean of
Students Will Terry.

The campus tax allowance for
the 1971 annual was $12,150 (or
$12 per student).

Approximately $1500 to $2500
may be added to the campus tax
because of additional revenue
gained from extra sales to
alumni and from advertising.

In making preparations for

‘Body President Bo Phillips, and

the 1972 annual, Ron Connelly
requested an additional $1000.

Instead of receiving an
allowance increase, the annual
budget was cut by $4150.

In other words, halfway into
the school year (a time when
most of the work for the annual
is completed), a 30 percent cut
in the budget was announced.

“This type of financial plan-
ning by the Student Body Finan-
cial Committee can be hard for
an annual editor to deal with,”
commented Currie.

Ron Connelly was elected
again as ‘“Quips and Cranks”’
editor, with a budget of $8000.

“Ron planned for a 1973 fall
annual from the very begin-
ning. I guess he made the choice
based on his previous year’s ex-
perience,’’ George said.

(Connelly, attending East
Carolina Medical School, was
not available for comment. )

The question of why the an-
nuals will be three months late
still remains.

“I think there are several
reasons why the annual is late,”’
said George.

“First, planning for an an-
nual should begin one and a half
years in advance of its
publication date.

‘‘Last year’s photography
editor didn’t put out assign-
ments until after Christmas!”’
George claimed.

Women Complicate
Maloney'’s Program

By PHILLIP BISHOP
Contributing Editor

(Ed. Note: This article is the
second in a three part series
dealing with Davidson advisory
programs for various types of
graduate schools. The sub-
sequent one will focus on the

pre-med program.
A pre-ministerial advisor
should be part juggler. He must

balance a student’s religious
conviction with seminary

requirements and with the.

demands of the student’s par-
ticular denomination.

To do all that requires not
only a juggler’s sense of balan-
ce, but also ‘‘a_ personal
knowledge of the students and
the seminaries,’’ according to
Religion Professor Samuel D.
Maloney.

Pre-ministerial advising has
been further complicated by
two relatively new phenomena
on the Davidson campus:
women students and religious
fundamentalism.

“How realistic is a girl who
wants to go into the ministry?”’
asked Maloney. ‘‘Once she is or-
dained, she probably can’t find
a pulpit.”

Maloney cited the Episcopal
Church as a denomination
which does not accept women
into the ministry.

More Davidson students are
interested in attending ex-
tremely conservative
seminaries, and Maloney at-
tributes this to the ‘fad of neo-
fundamentalism’.

“Not all forms of religious
faith are wholesome, and some
can cripple a student’s life,”
remarked Maloney, a former
Presbyterian pastor himself.

Most crippling for a student is
to attend a_ conservative
seminary and to find at
graduation that he cannot be or-
dained, said Maloney.

Maloney said his job was to
steer students away from the
pitfalls in selecting seminaries
with partial or questionable ac-
creditation.

Maloney’s view that the pre-
ministerial should not em-
phasize campus ministry, was
echoed by students. ‘‘You can’t
swamp an undergraduate with
material about being a
minister. Seminary teaches you
that,”’ said one pre-ministerial
student.

Most applicants to seminaries
are not confronted with the
competition facing those
seeking admission to medical or
other graduate schools.

“There's not much pressure
on people applying to
denominational _ seminaries.
But at the good divinity schools,
there is the same stiff com-
petition as at other graduate
schools,”’ said Davidson senior
John Simms.

The pre-ministerial com-
mittee has been reorganized
this fall in an effort to anticipate
the crush of applicants now
plaguing other postgraduate in-
stitutions. The committee has
been bolstered with a budget of
$1000, Maloney said.
