(collected by Gill Holland)

The one that flew

She's up on her toes in a jewelry store
To find a gull to fit her chain,
To fit it, silver wings all back,
Like it’s flying fast, like it’s flying late.

She know what it’s like and she saw one once
In a shop in Vermont, costing far too much.

So we missed our train, so we skipped our lunch

For the wings all back, to fit her chain.

She’s up on her toes in a jewelry store,

And a starfish bends to fit her chain,.
Lacking gulls that day, so she had it do

For the one that flew with its wings all back.

—James Barrat

Sinbad’s vacation
at North Myrtle Beach

The sail luffs

on the clothesline,

obstructing my view;

But as | look from the deck

out to the sea

| remember

“The Return of Sinbad the Sailor”
(In which | starred, | might add.)

| reflect on my great victory

at Trafalgar;

J count the gold coins | stole

from the Spanish Armada;

And | remember how—

faster than the bullets | dodged

on board the blockade runner “Greyhound”,
and more powerfully than

the battleship | commanded in

the Phillipines moved,

Yet as gracefully as the dolphins swam who
used to follow the charter boat

| sometimes fished on—

| performed my three-sixties —

then surfed into

the waiting arms

of bikini-clad beach babies

who called me Supersurfer.

“Thams” music in the background
reminds. me.of my kid brother;

out on a date he met surfing.

(| wonder if he can do three-sixties?)
.He’s driving my convertible

to the latest hot-spot: .

“The Spanish Galleon”; maybe,

or “Another World.” -

HE will not have to fight

the battle of Trafalgar, tonight.
