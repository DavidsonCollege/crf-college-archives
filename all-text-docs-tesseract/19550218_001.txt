Morehead fo Edit
Wildcat Handbook

The YMCA cabinet has an-
nounced the selection of Dick
Morehead to edit the Wildeat
Mendbook for the 1955-56 term.
The Handbook, a publication of the
Y, ‘will be distributed to all stu-
dents early in the fall semester.

Morehead, a junior from Hunting-
ton, W. Va., is a member of Kappa
Alpha social fraternity and an Eng-
lish major. He served Philan-
thropic Literary Soicety as its vice-
president and is manager of the
swimming team.

He has gained experience in pub-
lication activities as associate edi-
tor of the Hendbook, feature edi-
tor of The Davidsonian, and copy
editor of the Quips end Cranks.

As editor, Morehead plans an
analysis of some of the better
handbooks published by other col-
leges in order to issue a Handbook
of “similar quality to last year’s
commendable publication.” The
nature of the new edition will be
structurally correspondent with
last years; there will be a change
of style, however.

‘Bishop Misbehaves’
Recommended For
Pre-Danceé Activity

What in the world are you going
to do with your date between the
hours of 7:30 and 9:90 tonight (Fri-
day)? We suggest that for two
hours of fun and entertainment, as
well as some good drama, you all
see the Red and Black Masquer’s
production of “The Bishop Mis-
behaves.” After last night's ex-
cellent performance to a packed
house, tonight's should prove to
be superb.

As well as affording you an op-
portunity for holding hands, this
play will be a good means by which
to test your date. If she acts em-
barrassed, a little nervous, and
wants to head for the dance at
intermission time, then you had
best give her the other half of her
round-trip ticket on the spot. If
your date chuckles politely, think
seriously about Saturday night’s
dance. But if she howls uproarious-
ly ... a good thing.

Dublin Players Present
“Juno”, “Blithe Spirit’

By O. H. OGDEN

On Friday and Saturday Feb-
ruary 25 and 26, “One of the finest
acting companies that has ever
come to this country .. .” The
Dublin Players, will perform on
the Davidson stage in conjunction
with the college Artist Series. On
Friday, at 8:15 ,p.m., the troupe
will be seen in Noel Coward's most
famous play, Blithe Spirit, and
dune and the Paycock, by Sean
O'Casey, is to be given on Satur
day afternoon at 3:00. .

The Dublin Players was origin-
ally formed by Ronald Ibbs ip
Ireland in 1947 under the name
of the Ronald Ibbs Company, and
was designed to be a touring com-

. pany in Ireland which would play

a season each year in Dublin. Mr.
Tbbs had been leading mar at the
Gate Theatre in the Earl of Long-
ford’s Company, where his wife,
Maureen Halligan, was also a lead
and a director.

BARLY IBBS COMPANY

After two years of playing in
Ireland, the Jbbs Company was
encouraged by Eric Bentley, critie,
author, and dramatist, to make 2
tour of America under the auspices
of the International Theatre Ex-
change. It was during this first
two-year period that the players
performed Hemlet in tweeds and
modern dress under the direction
of Tyrone Gutherie, famed direc-
tor of the Old Vic Theatre in Lon-
don.

For this first American tour,
Ibbs divided his company into two
units, one to travel in this country
under the title of The Dublin
Players, and one to remain in Ire-
land. Miss Halligan directed this
touring group.

The original American tour was
so successful that the time was ex-
tended and Mr. Ibbs rejoined the
company in New York. This is
their second coast-to-coast series
of appearances, which will encom-

‘ pass more than 100 major cities

of the United States and Canada
this year.
The Dublin Players company is
composed of the finest actors from
Ireland’s famous Abbey and Gate
Theatres. These theaters have

formed a cradle and a nourisher
for modernity in the theatre in
Ireland, as well as the internation-
al theatre.
ABBEY AND GATE
THEATRES

Between 1899 and 1902 the Ab-
bey Theatre experimented with an
Irish theatre, with W. B. Yeats
and others, and led to the found-
ing of the Irish National Theatre
Society in 1902. Such names as
Lady Gregory, A. E. (George Rus-
sell), and J. M. Synge have been
connected with it as directors and
as playwrights. In 1904 Miss
A. E. F. Horniman gave a subsidy
and the free use of the Abbey
Theatre in Dubfin and six years
later the Theatre was bought for
the players by public subscription.
Generally known as the Irish
Players, they toured the United
States in 1911-12, and twice in the
thirties.

The Dublin Gate Theatre, which
the Earl of Longford and Lady
Longford joined in 1931, was de-
signed to be international rather
than local.

NOBL COWARD'S TALENTS

Noel Coward is considered to be
the most representative of the
playwrights of post-war (World
War I) Britain and his exceptional
versatility is evidenced in the fact
that he has nearly run the gamut
of theatrical expression in the
quarter of a century since his first
play appeared.

Coward's gift for humor will be
exhibited in the Friday night pro-
duction of Blithe Spirit. In New
York in 1941, Blithe Spirit was
given the longest run that any
Coward play has had anywhere.
This is a “fantastic comedy” of a
man, married for the second time,
who is plagued by th& ghost of
his first wife. This smash hit of the
London, Broadway, and Dublin
stages is now recognized as a
classic of the modern theatre.

ALSO SEAN O’CASEY

“Among the Irish dramatists
who came to the fore after World
War I, Sean O’Casey has no peer,”
wrote one critic. We feel that in
this area his one superior may be
J. M. Synge. For his characteriza-
tion and ability to write dialogue,
O'Casey is probably the outstand-
ing playwright of our time. Lack-
ing in classic form, he writes of
the life and the people about him;
like Chekhov, Schnitzler, and
O'Neill, he projects his own life
before the footlights.

In 1924 “. . . one of the cen-
tury’s great dramas... ,” June
and the Paycock appeared. The
play is a tragedy, dealing with the
late terror of the civil war (1922)
and the struggle for security in
Ireland. John Gassner has termed
the work, “. . . poetic, high-voltage
realism.”

The masterful presentations of
the Dublin Players come from the
pens of such pillars of the dra-
matic world as Shaw, Yeats, Ibsen,
Synge, Lady Gregory, Oscar
Wilde, and Shakespeare. “They
speak more beautifully than any
group I've ever heard,” said Ben
Gross in the New York Daily News,
and Fulton Oursler has called
their performances “Sheer magic
in the theatre.”

Business-Eco Mee
Will Feature Forum

The Business-Economics Asso-
ciation features Mr. Kenneth
Kramer and Mr. Ed S. Dillard in
a program entitled “Current La-
bor Problems” in the Ball Room
of the College Union at 8:00 P.M.,
Thursday, February 24.

Mr. Ed Dillard is familiar to
many Davidson students. He was
a panelist on one of the first pro-
gtams presented by the Business-
Economics Association entitled
“Opportunity vs. Security.” Mr.
Dillard is president of the Old
Dominion Box Co., of Charlotte,
a company having seven plants in
three states.

RIGHT-TO-WORK CHAIRMAN

Since his last visit to the David-
son campus, Mr. Dillard has been
elected chairman of the National
Right-to-Work Committee. This
committee is a new organization

attempting to make “every citizen -

conscious of what union compul-
sion really means.” The president
of this committee is former New
Jersey congressman Fred A, Hart-
ley, co-author of the Taft-Hartley
law.

Mr. Dillard declares that his
committee wants to “obtain over-
whelming acceptance of the idea
that no American must be a mem-
ber of a union to hold a job.” He
believes that a number of union
members who are now bound by
union shop contracts, do not ap-
prove of compulsion and would
like to see it clearly banned by
law.

He notes that 17 states now
have right-to-work laws. In the
forthcoming program Mr. Dillard
will express his views on this and
other related issues facing man-
agement and labor.

CIO ORGANIZER
Appearing on the program with
Mr. Dillard will be Mr. Kenneth
Kramer, the assistant Southern
Organizing Director of the Textile

Workers Union of America, C.LO.

Mr. Kramer has been an organizer
for the Textile Workers since 1933.
He has served on the National
C.1L.0. Community Services Com-
mittee, and as a labor panel mem-
ber of the Wage Stabilization
Board in 1950 and 1951. He is
well acquainted with labor prob-
lems from the position of organized
labor.

Dr. Jones, Charlotte,
Will Speak at Vespers

Dr. James A. Jones, pastor of
the Myers Park Presbyterian
Church in Charlotte will speak at
vespers this Sunday night.

After graduating from Davidson
College with a B.S. degree, Dr.
Jones attended Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, Virginia.
From this institution he earned
his Th. M., and Hampden-Sydney
College later awarded him the
honorary doctor’s degree. He has
also done special graduate work
at New College, Edinburgh Uni-
versity, Edinburgh, Scotland.

From October 1948 to March
1949, Dr. Jones, representing the
Foreign Missions Committee as one
of the two ministers from the
Presbyterian Church, U.S., visited
the mission fields of the world.
He spent some time in the Belgian
Congo, where he attended confer.
ences and visited nine stations and
other outposts. He preached ‘to the
missionaries during their confer-
ence and had conferences with the
native pastors and leaders.

After leaving Africa, Dr. Jones
flew to Brazil, where he visited
three missions of the Presbyterian
Church. Again he held special
meetings and preached to both
the missionaries _ and native
leaders.

At the request of the Board of
World Missions and‘the American
Presbyterian Congo Mission, Dr.
Jones again visited the Belgian
Congo in 1952.

Recently he has been chosen
president-elect of Union Theologi-
cal Seminary in Richmond, Vir-
ginia, and he will be inaugurated
later this year.

DOROTHY KAE ... Morrow’s Beautiful Songstress

Student Constitution Has
Had Several Revisions

If the proposed revisions of the
Student Government Constitution
meet with the approval of the Da
vidson student body within the
next two weeks, they will repre-
sent the fifth major change in this
document since its inception in
1911.

Just as we have found that our
present day constitution is not
completely in accord with our ever
changing attitudes and opinions,
so also have previous generations
of Davidsonians taken it upon
themselves to ‘modernize’ their
constitution when they felt it
necessary to do so.

FIRST REVISION IN 1914

The first major revision came
just after the first constitution was
written. Under the leadership of
Alfred Scarborough of the Class
of 1915, the student council
secured the help of Justice T. B.
Fraser, an alumnus of Davidson
and an associate on the South Caro-
lina Supreme Court, and improved
the existing document. The new
version, which was adopted in Sep-
tember of 1914, was incorporated
under one article with eighteen
sections, and dealt principally with
the honor system. A second article
which was attached to the first
was titled “Moral Code.” There was
also two further additions which
defined and outlawed hazing.

SECOND IN 1920

Revision number two came in
the spring of 1920 when the en-
tire constitution was rewritten and
divided into nine articles rather
than the original two. This draft
differed a great deal from its
predecessor since the student body
officers, in defining the honor sys-
tem, made it extremely broad. For
instance, included in the article
dealing with the honor system
were not only the present rules
concerning cheating, stealing and
so forth, but a section which stated
there would be “no playing of
musical instrument between 8 p.m.,
and If p.m. except on Saturday
and Sunday.” A student, thus, was
on his honor to report violations
of this nature.

THIRD IN 1926

In 1924 the incoming and out-
going presidents of the student
body, realizing that the scope of
the honor system was too broad
to be effective, presented a joint
revision which limited and defined
the honor system as applying only
to cheating, stealing, and lying
under oath. A further change was
made when the other provisions
formerly lumped together under
the “honor system” article were
put into a separate article known
as the “Student Body Regula-
tions.” The year 1924 also saw the
establishment of the Publication
Board and the Student Store Board
of Control.

FOURTH IN 1937-38

The final revision came in the
year 1937-38 when some of the
existing articles were divided and
the sections applying to the
mechanics of student government
were more clearly defined. This
revision also brought about a
revolutionary change in the privil-
eges of freshmen, as they were al.
lowed, for the first time, to vote
in school elections. The point
system represents a further addi-
tion of this revision.

Last year a group of students
made an effort to bring about
several amendments in the consti-
tution, but no major changes re-
sulted.

It is obvious that if interested
and conscientious students
throughout the last four decades
had not exerted their influence to
bring about necessary changes, our
constitution would be a useless and
out-dated document indeed. I€ is
now a great many years since the
last major revisions were made,
and there is little doubt that cer.
tain changes are very much in
order now.

The student government com-
mittee on the constitution has
spent many hours in analyzing the
document article by article and
section by section, and has evolved
some excellent, much needed pro-
posals, It is the hope of those who
have followed the activities of this

Tonight With Play

Morrow Will Supply The
Music For Two Dances

By JOE CONARROE

The Davidson student body is exchanging the “hook look”
for the formal look tonight as it settles down for a delightful

weekend with the fair sex.

Activities for the festive Midwinters weekend will get
under way at 7:30 this evening with the Red and Black Mas-
quer’s production, “The Bishop Misbehaves.” The play, which
stars Fred Summers as the Bishop, will be presented

in Chambers Auditorium.

LF.C. Reveals Policy
Governing Hell Week
And Other Activities

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Ronald Wilson this week re-
vealed a new “self-regulation”
policy for governing Hell-week and
its related activities. These regu-
lations were arrived at by a com-
mittee consisting of fraternity
presidents and_ interested  in-
dividuals representing each of the
charter fraternities of the Inter-
fraternity Council.

This group has met more than
eight times since the second week
in November, representing a total
of 300 man-hours expended in
seeking a workable solution to this
problem. President Wilson empha-
sized the fact that this group was
working on their own initiative,
apart from any faculty pressure.

The object of the meetings and
the gist of the plan itself was to
place fraternity pre-initiation
“ceremonies” in the proper per-
spective with regard to the pri-
mary scholastic function of the col-
lege. The heart of the plan ap-
pears in the resolution adopted and
passed unanimously by the com-
mittee and subsequently adopted
by the Interfraternity Council as
the fundamental policy for the
year 1955:

“No pledge shall be injured.

No pledge shall be publicly
humiliated. No pledge shall be
required to carry out any
action which would bring dis-
evredit upon himself, his fra-
ternity, or the college.”

Further details as viewed in the
light of the broad generalities as
expressed above and as interpreted
by the Interfraternity Council in-
clude: 1. Pledges ere required to
have (a specified amount) of sleep
during the week. 2. Pledges ere
held responsible for maintaining
their studies during the week. 3.
All Hell-week activities will be
plenned for and implemented by
a specific Hell-week committee
within each individual fraternity.
4. No individual fraternity mem-
ber will be permitted to carry out
any Hell-week activities without
the authorization of the Hell-week
committee of the fraternity. 5. All

YALE MUSICIAN VISITS D.C.:

Prof. Wilson Leads Band

The Davidson College Concert
Band will be presented in concert
Wednesday night, February 23, at
8:15 o’clock in Chambers Audi-
torium. Keith L. Wilson, Yale Uni-
versity Band conductor, will be
guest conductor.

Mr. Wilson, also associate pro-
fessor of wind instrument playing
at Yale University, was appointed
to the faculty of the Yale School
of Music in 1946. After graduat-
ing from the University of Mli-
nois, he was woodwind instructor,
theory teacher, conductor of: the
operas and assistant conductor of
the bands at the University of
Iowa.

He received the degrees of B.S.
in Musie Education, Bachelor of
Music, and Master of Music from
the University of Mlinois, and
while there was also clarinetist in
both the University Band and Uni-
versity Orchestra.

The guest conductor spent three
summers on the faculty of the Na-
tional Music Camp at Interlochen,
Mich., where he also studied clari-
net and conducting. He has con-
ducted concerts of the New Haven

Symphony, the University Orches-
tra, a number of chamber music
orchestra concerts, and has been
guest conductor for several high
school and college bands.

As a dlarinetist, he plays num-
erous chamber music recitals
throughout New England and the
New York area. He serves as a
clinician and adjudicator for high
school music festivals and contests,
and has recorded for Contempo-
rary and Epic records.

Featured on the program are
Gounod's “Mirella Overture,” the
“Military Symphony in F” by Gos-
sec, “Folk Song Suite” by the con-
temporary English composer Ralph
Vaughan-Williams, and a medley of
famous marches.

Professor Kenneth Moore of the
Music Department is director of
the Concert Band which will make
its annual spring tour this year,
beginning on March 28 to Tulane.
University in New Orleans.

There will be no admission
charge for the concert. The stu-
dent body and public are cordially
invited to attend.

Following the play the scene of
the evening's activities will shift
to the Johnston Gymnasium where
the formal dance will take place
from 9:30 p.m. until 1:30 am.
Buddy Morrow, his nationally fa
mous orchestra, and featured
songstress Dorothy Kae will be
supplying the music.

AFTERNOON CONCERT

Tomorrow afternoon the David:
son swains and their ladies will be
treated to a concert by the Mor-
row musicians. The music will be
gin at 3:30 in Chambers Audi-
torium. The weekend festivities
will be climaxed tomorrow night
with an informal dance. The Sat-
urday dance will begin at 8 and
last until midnight.

Ronnie Wilson, president of the
Interfraternity Council, has an-
nounced that a permanent canopy,
to be used at all future dances in
case of rain, has been erected be-
hind the gymnasium. If former
Midwinters weekends are any in-
dictation of what might happen
tonight, the new canopy could
very well get a good workout.

RAIN DANCE THEME

Ted Andrae, chairman of the
decorations committee for the
dance, has disclosed that the deco-
rations center around the theme
“Rain Dance,” which, he said,
“seems peculiarly fitting for Mid-
winters.” The theme is carried out
with the golors of white and
American-beauty-rose red. The
committee has been working on
the decorations for several days,
and the results should prove en
joyable to the Davidson dancers.

Bandleader Morrow, the man
with the mellow trombone, is mak-
ing his second appearance at Da-
vidson this weekend. At the Home.
coming activities in 1952 his dance
music as well as the afternoon con-
cert met with enthusiastic approval
of the student body. Since that
time he has played throughout the
country and has continually
broadened his repertoire to in-
clude many more instrumentals,
as well as good danceable music.

Morrow's musical activities be-
gan during his early teens in his
hometown of New Haven, Connecti-
cut. He received his musical edu-
cation at the Julliard School of
Music in New York. His musical
career has included experience
with Paul Whiteman, Artie Shaw,
Eddie Duchin, Vincent Lopez and
the Dorsey brothers.

Eye Witness Gives
Account of Theater
Fire Monday Night

By MALCOLM WILLIAMSON

At 8:45 on Monday night the
Davidson theater was consumed by
fire. There were about 30 devotees
of the arts in the building when
the flames concluded the long
period of service provided by the
local flick.

For perhaps thirty minutes be-
forehand, the building had been
filled with smoke, but we thought
it was from the cigar of U. S.
Grant as he sat beneath a tree
talking peace with Sitting Bull.
Some of the patrons had become
rather nervous, but when the
ticket seller made an inspection
trip to the back portions of the
building and walked up the aisle
with a calm serenity, we felt as-
sured that nothing serious had
happened.

But as the smoke became so
thick that it was difficult for the
flickering light from the projector
to reach the screen, many of the
student patrons began to mutter
“This place is on fire!” But no
