CINEMA NEWS

The Union is indeed fortunate
to have Dave Simpson as chief of the
film committee. Dave was the driving
force for the highly successful fine
film festival here this spring and
promises us a summer series that
Will almost match thet of the springs

The first film will be Charge

of the Light Brigade, one of the
outstanding films to come out of
Hollywood. This film is taken
from the poem of the same name
by Tennyson. see e

Micheal Curtiz is directing
Olivia de Hevillend and David Niven
in this film, and that would seem
to be @ recommendation in itself.

‘This film is to be shown on
Friday and Saturdey ‘nights at
8:00 o'clock on the Union patio.

CINEMA VI

R.E. Schreder, manager of the
Visulite Theatre, is inaugurating
his summer series of films--Cineme VI—
this Wednesday night at 9:00 Pi,

The opening show is to be one
of: the most powerful Ingmar: Bergman
films, The Seventh Seal. This should
be @ memorable series, and one well

-worth its cost:

The cost is $2.00 per seet for
this performance and $6.00 for the
entire-series. This seems to be @
worthwhile investment for those
who demand that cinema live up to
its potential as an art.

THE LAW

"J have but one rule for
Davidson students: be gentlemen."
This is a familiar rule for those
who have taken the time to study
the little handbook of regulations
for Davidson students.

Gone is the day when such rules
were actually in effect. In the
second desede of this century, the
University of Virginia had but two
rules of conduct: each student was
to comport himself as a gentleman,
and no pets were to be allowed in
the dormitories.

Now, there are countless
interpretations of gentlemanly
behavior in every college handbook.
Does it not seem odd that a virtue
that wes teken for granted fifty
years ago must now be explained
to us in the minutest detail?

ALL DESKMEN MEET AT THE UNION AT 3:00 PM TODAY
