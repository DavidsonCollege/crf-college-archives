CORNELIUS LEADS IN
SUNDAY S. ATTENDANCE

In spite of the bad weather and the
snow on the ground the “Y”" Sunday
Schools had good attendances Sunday.
On account of the impassible condition
of the roads the boys could not reach
Oak Grove and consequently there is
no report.

The five teachers at Caldwell were en-
tertained at one of the homes for supper
after Sunday School. It is rumored that
they had four kinds of desert and there-
fore ten teachers will go next Sunday.

The report follows:

Present. Teachers.

STUDENTS TO ADDRESS
Y. M. C. A. NEXT SUNDAY

The Y. M. C. A., of course, aims to de-
velop the students as much as possible
along religious lines. With this in view,

plans have been on foot for some time to

have some of the students themselves
speak at the regular Sunday night meet-
ing. One of these meetings has been
arranged for next Sunday, when Flynn
Long, “Jick” Taylor and C. K. Brown
will speak. It is hoped that the stu-
dents will come out in farge numbers,
to give these men a hearty reception.
The following Sunday Dr. McCrory
and his famous colored quartet from
Biddle University, Charlatte, will be on
the hill. The enthusiastic comments of
the students when this matter was first
discussed seem to indicate a big crowd
will hear Dr. McCrory. Certainly, the
“special music” which has attracted so
much attention in the past few meetings
will go under, eclipsed on this night.

DAVIDSON BIBLE CLASS
LECTS OFFICERS

D. R. Freeman Is First President.

Much interest was manifested by the
announcement that Dr. Fraser Hood
would take charge of the Davidson Bi-
ble Class, and about 70 men assembled
for the first meeting on Sunday, Jan-
uary 23d. The second meeting which
was held in the Phi Society hall last
Sunday afternoon, marked the begin-
ning of a new custom on the campus.

At this meeting officers were elected.
D. R. Freeman will be the first presi-
dent, G. B. Sorrells, vice-president, and
H. H. Smith, secretary and treasurer.
In the future this class will be held in a
section of the Sunday School at the
church.

The interesting way in which Dr.
Hood presents the lesson, together with
his strong personality, makes him an
ideal teacher for young men. Students
who do not use this opportunity to learn
more about the vital things of life are
losing something worth while.

STUDY OF NEW BOOK BEGUN
BY SUNDAY MORN'’G CLASSES

Bible study has taken the place of
mission study on the hilf and under the
leadership of Jim McKeldin, chairman
of the Bible study committee, work
along this line has taken a new start.

Beginning with last Sunday morning a
new book, “How Jesus Met Life Ques-
tions,” by Harrison S. Elliott, was used
as a basis of the discussion.

As. there are 29 chapters in this book
and only 16 more Sundays before the
summer vacation, a committee has been
appointed to choose the best 16 chap-
ters for our study.

Copies of this book may be obtained
at the book room and it is hoped that
as many as can will obtain them.

Last Sunday morning 279 men attend-
ed the opening meeting of these dis-
cussion groups.

WOODROW WILSON
ON THE BIBLE

This io What President Wilson
Wrote for the Testaments for
the Soldiers and Sailors.

“The Bible is the word of life. I
beg that you will read it and find
thie out for yourselves—read, not
little snatches here and there, but
long passages that will really be
the road to the heart of it. You
will find it full of real men and
women not only, but also of the
things you have wondered about
and been troubled about all your
life, as men have beon always; and
the more you read the more it will
become plain to you what things
are worth while and what are not,
what things make men happy—
loyalty, right dealing, speaking the
truth, readiness to give everything
for what they think their duty, and
most of all, the wish that they
may have the real approval of the
Christ, who gave everything for
them—and the things that are
guaranteed to make men unhappy
—~eelfishness, cowardice, greed and
everything that is low and mean.
When you have read the Bible you
will know that it is the Word of
God, because you will have found
it the key to your heart, your own
happiness and your own duty.”

MINISTERIAL BAND.

The Ministerial Band met Sunday aft-
ernoon for a short meeting. After the
regular devotional exercises, Albert
Wildman, J. O. Knight and Buck Curry
made interesting informal talks. It is
hoped that every ministerial student
will come to the meetings.

BRIEF BITS OF R. O. T. C. NEWS.

All men who expect to go to the sum-
mer camp this year will have to be vac-
cinated soon, as the cold weather is the
best time.

The camp this summer will be held at
Chattanooga, one of the most beautiful
and historic of Southern cities.

A band concert is planned for Wash-
ington’s birthday. Band Leader Free-
man has not yet made all his plans, but
will soon have completed them.

The rifle range will be completed for
use on March the rst. Each man in the
corps will be allowed to fire 200 rounds.

A rifle team of 20 is to be picked. They
will be allowed to use all the ammuni-
tion they wish. They will not leave the
hill, but the comparative scores will be
sent to the other colleges and the win-
ner wilt be announced.

Hereafter classes that are missed will
be made up by handing in an outline of
the work covered in the recitation miss-
ed. The drill will be made up some aft-
ernoon when there is nothing to conflict.

The faculty has decided that punish-
ment tours of one hour for each excess
demerit will be walked off on Saturday
afternoons from two to six. The cadet
officers do not have to walk but are un-
der pledge to remain in their room dur-
ing the time indicated.

The snow last week having inter-
rupted the map making in the R. O. T.
C. department, the time was taken up by
the showing of moving pictures of actual
map sketching, as done by Uncle Sam’s
regulars in the field. The pictures were
interesting as well as instructive. They
began with a panorama view of a val-
ley with its small farms, village, rail-
roads, streams, etc., and then showed a
correctly drawn map of this same area.
Different signs weré given to show the
varied physical features that must be
represented on a map of this nature and
also show to determine distances from
different points.

To make it plainer a view of the coun-
try was shown from an aeroplane and
how the contours of a mountain would
look to a person from that position. The
pictures were well worth seeing and will
be a great aid to Uncle Sam's future map
sketchers.
