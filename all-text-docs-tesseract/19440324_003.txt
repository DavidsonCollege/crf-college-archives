ITH THE
ILDCATS

By JIM LOWRY

Perhaps the most important sports feature to Carolina fans
this week is the Charlotte Open at the Myers Park Country
° Club. With most of the top-flight golfers in
the nation playing under the bright sun, shirt
sleeved; fans saw Dutch Harrison setting the
pact at the half way mark with a blistering
136. Trailing him by two and jour strokes
respectively are Jug McSpaden, with 138 and
Byron Nelson with 140. Harrison, aiter a
superb round of 66, came back with a brilliant
70, ineiuding a hole-in-one cagle, on which the
litle white golf balf behaved very similar to a
three cushion English shor by Willie Hoppe.
With Jupiter J luvius slowing down the tour-

one round will be played Monday and]

“the finacs Tuesday, if the lovely Charlocue weather isi’. running
down the sewer, lt is almost a certainty that one o: che
above mentioned golfers will Knock down top money. Today.

Harrison plays with MeSpaden and Geb Jlamilton, and Nelson

plays with Tony Penna and Ed Dudley.

Basketball . .

It’s March the 20th and basketbal) js still in full
swing with the Eastern and Western N. C. A.
tourneys at the Garden. The first games saw St. Johns
edge Bowling Green 44-40, and DePaul’s heavy laden
navy team romp on Mulenberg by 20 points. Ken-
ttucky, the best civilian team in the south. and possibly
the best in the nation, takes on the Utah Utes, and are
heavily favored to go into the finals against DePaul.
In the Eastern playoffs, the Big Green from Dartmouth
is favered to clash with Ohio State in the finals and
it will probably be DePaul and Dartmouth in the
championship tilt.

Track

{if Gil Dobbs runs a mile every week by the tirst of May he
“dught to have run ike four minute mile. Last week in Chi-
cago, the bespeckled preacher won the Bankers mile with a
seintilattineg £:07:5, and Jast night atter his sermon he went
out and galloped a mile in 4:00:4. Nobody seems to be able to
_eateh hint sol think they ouehttopur_amechanicaloabbiin

This and Here from That and There
~ Jack Wyman, co-captain of last vear’s crack Davidson cage
squad is now a second licuténant at Camp Maxey, Texas. Jack
gut married last summer and is expecting a litte Wyman in
the next few montis. Jt seems that Davidson arhleces of last
year are scaitered ali bver the country, Oregon. Texas, Louis-
iana. Benning. and nobody today knows where fohnny lred-
cricks its.

Liu. Lacy’ McbLean, who was one of the best publicity men
Davidson -has—had_in the past years, is down in Louisiaha.
and expects to be sent across within the next two or three)
months. — _

The Davidson baseball team. with prospects none tov
bright anyway lost their best prospect last week when Red
Williams got his Air Corps orders after two days of pritc-
tice.” It seenis like a-wise: man spoke the truth awhen he
said to be a Wildcat means to have -had breaks.

_—— —Interfrat Track Meet

eek

_K._A’s won.the inter frat-track-meet Jast- w:
by overwhelming score of some thirty points. They
placed in- every event and won most of them. They

were helped extremely by the Kappa Snapper house,
a member of their farm system, which contributed
22 points. Somebody said that if a freshman went out
on the track with a red hat on and Royster saw him.
Prof. Royster could run a 45 second 440.

Carolina had 60 men out for basehall last week. The only
thing we can say is that song about “we three, we’re all alone.”
Well the Tarheels new song is 'V-12, we're ail alone.” And
so with this quaint remark we leave the little town of Chewing-
Gum on the Bedppst until next time. Will the Air Corp learn
anew song? We don't know.
