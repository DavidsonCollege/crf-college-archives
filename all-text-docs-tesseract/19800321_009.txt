forced: nearly all schools away

schools, allow individuals to

A close friend of ours by
the name of Ann Landers
informed us of the unfortunate
problem of her receiving excess
mail at her office. She asked if
she could forward some of her
mail to us at B and BB Inc. We
told her we were happy to
handle some of her troubled
writers and that we were emi-
nently qualified to do so being
that we all are working hard at
getting our B.A. in Abnormal
Psychology under the tutelage

of Tom Cartmill, Richard

Coincidentally, a few of the
myriad of letters Madanie Lan-
ders sent us are applicable to
today’s scene at Davidson
College. May we be permitted
to share some of these demented
letters with you?... Thank you.
Dear Abigail van Brick Bros.,

I am a thick junior at

" Davidson College with an infini-

tesimally small GPA. But small
tock (sic) aside, I was wonder-
ing how you sine (sic) up for

President of SGA. I got (sic)
some really sooper (sic) ideag—
yue wanna hear ‘em? You
better, or I’ll kick yore (sic)
butt. Here is (sic) some of them.
1) Put a wait (sic) room in the
library.

2) Incarcerate (sic) a new major
sport. G

3) Beer in the wodder (sic)
fountains.

4) Another thing I’ve been

thinkin’ sort of like, in Cincin- ©

natti'we kind of do this and like
the intramural fields with the
hirls with Chambers and you

know the Post Office—and
Maybe like with us being more
aggressive with more minor like

we could lower the tuition as a~

result (all very sic).

5) Substantiate (sic) professirs
(sic) salaries by letting ‘em do
the grownds (sic) around heer
(sic). I’ve always liked picking
up looose trash; and I . think
they could make munny (sic)
and everybody would be really

“happy and would want tow (sic)

party.
