FIRE AT WILL

Two members of the Davidson rifle team get into position for
some invigorating target practice.

Duke, Hig

By FRANK STIEFEL
Staff Writer

Last Friday at Davidson,
the Wildcat soccer team
‘played a top 20 ranked team
for the second time in a week,
with the opponent this time
being Duke University.

_Due to the fine playing of
this year’s team, as well as the
importance of this contest, an
excellent crowd was on hand.

However, things did not
start off well for Davidson this
~time. From the onset, Duke
showed an excellent passing
game which enabled them to
keep the pressure on.

Davidson managed to get
the ball into Duke territory,
but seemed to always lack
that one last break necessary
for scoring. In the meantime,
Duke’s offense was. still
moving well and, with about a

third of the first half gone,
they finally beat the tough Cat
defense.

After this Duke score, the
Cats still couldn’t get their of-
fense going, and Duke had the
pressure on again. Great
playing by the Davidson
defense as well as several
good saves.and long kicks by
goalie Charlie Slagle managed
to keep Duke at bay.

Unfortunately for Davidson,
the half was a minute too long,

as a Duke penetration finally ©

ended in a score. At half, the
score was Duke 2-Davidson 0.
As the second half started, it
‘ was quite obvious that David-
son had no intentions of giving
up. Right away the Cats put
the pressure on Duke, also
managing to almost com-
pletely shut off the Blue
Devils’ offense.

However, Davidson was still
having trouble getting a good
shot off - a problem that
plagued them all day. Finally,
mid-way through the second
half, Duke was called for a
hands violation. Tom Black-
wood put the Cats on the
board, scoring on the penalty
kick.

Davidson continued
assault on the Duke goal.
However, two sensational
saves by their goalie, along
with several missed chances
by Davidson, proved to be too
much for Davidson, as they
lost 2-1. Davidson had totally
out-played Duke in the second
half, but just couldn’t get a
break.

On Tuesday,
hosted High Point College.

Shooters Aim At Matches,
Winning Season In Sights

By CHUCK KENNON
Sports Editor

Following two years of
‘‘building,’’ the. Davidson
College rifle team has come of
age. This is the optimistic pic-
ture presented by Capt. Abel
White of the ROTC depart-
ment, the director of the team.

“In the past I’ve been trying
to generate interest-.in the
team. At the same time I’ve
wanted to establish a realistic
schedule. I believe that this
year will be a success in both
respects, and I’m pretty sure
we'll have a winning record,”
White predicted.

White bases these hopes on

kick by Joe Duncan.

Early in the second half,
High Point came back to tie
the game up on a goal after a
good save by Slagle.

Davidson continued to keep
on good offensive pressure,
and finally scored on an ex-
cellent long lob shot by fresh-
n Chuck Fiden. ,

the ability of returning
shooters and the strength of
the other schools in the
Southern Conference.

The rifle team has seven
definite returning lettermen,
White said. He stated that all
of these are capable of turning
in consistent scores of 250 out
of 300 possible points. Bob An-
ders and Pete Goodman are
probably the best consistent
shooters on the team, ac-
cording to White.

There are also five new
shooters who have indicated
interest in the program.

However, Davidson’s defen-
se couldn’t keep a persistent
High Point team from scoring,
or keep themselves from
scoring, as the’ Cat defense
scored for High Point while
trying to clear.

It was a definitely disap-
pointing tie for the Cats, as
High Point was not expected
to give Davidson that tough a
battle.

sity, and the search is on for
someone to fill her sling. “I
believe that either Curt Goho
or Dallas Kirkendol will take
her place‘on the team, but the
slot is still open,’’ White said.

Predictions for a good
season are also founded in a
belief that Davidson is
prepared to compete with all
other teams. ‘“The Citadel and
Clemson have the biggest
programs and are always
strong. We are even with some
schools and there are others
we always can defeat,’’ he ex-
plained.

White is chairman of .the
Southern Conference Rifle

Association for this year. He

said, “I’m pleased becausé”
this year, for the first time,
the Southern Conference will
have full representation.

“East Carolina and Furman
have added teams. This is
great because now all those
schools have marksmanship
programs and that is what we
want - to generate interest in
marksmanship.”

The Davidson team is
currently engaged with prac-
tice three days a week. The
first Contest is a tournament
on Nov. 16. The first match
here is Jan. 11.
