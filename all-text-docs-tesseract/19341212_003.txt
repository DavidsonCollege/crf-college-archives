THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 12, 1934

Davidson Colleg

e Half-Hour

Introduces Novel Ensemble

Saxophone Sextet, Orchestra, And
Glee Club Present Radio
Program

SKIP BROWN ANNOUNCES

“Good evening .. . Ladies and gentle-
men. You are listening to the popular
melody of ‘O Davidson’ as it introduces
the regular Davidson College half-hour
brought to you through the remote con-
trol facilities of Station WBT, and
originating in the auditorium of the
Chambers Building on the college catn-
pus at Davidson, N. C.”

With these words Skip Brown, David-
son’s radio announcer extraordinary, in-
troduced last Friday night’s presentation
by “the Salon Orchestra, the\Glee Club,
and a novel instrumentation unit in the
shape of a saxophone ensemble. ‘The
initial selection” was “a rendition of the
famous ‘Sleeping Beauty Waltzes’ by
Tschakovsky . .. This number is ideally
suited for the salon orchestra instrumen-
tation made up of three first, violins, two
second violins, one viola, one cello, one
string ‘bass’, a flute, two clarinets, a
bassoon, two trumpets, two french horns,
a trombone, and a tympanni.”

Whereupon, with Prof. Prohl handling
the baton, the aforementioned organiza-
tion soothed thousands of. ears with a
very smooth musical accomplishment.

“The Davidson College Glee Club in
a Chorale number ‘Break forth O
Beautious Heavenly Light’, by Bach. The
season of Christmas could be no more
appropriately ushered in than by this
classical chorale from Bach's Christmas
Oratoric.”

In their most polished manner David-
son’s men o’ vocal might responded to
Prof. Pfohl’s direction. throughout this
enchanting selection. Following this by
singing “Lo, how a rose e’r blooming”,
by Prytorious, an early writer, the Glee
Club completed their activity for that
part of the program.

There followed an announcement con#’

cerning organist Kennedy’s Tuesday eve-
ning concert in the auditorium, after
which we came to “the feature of this
evening’s program. In all of Sousa’s
concerts, the outstanding novelty was al-
ways a saxophone band. ‘This instru-
ment . . . has classical possibilities, as
will be initimated by the Davidson Col-
lege saxophone ensemble, in their offer-
ing of ‘El Capitan’, by John Philip
Sousa.”

With Buddy Robinson, alto saxophone,
standing before them, the ensemble, com-
posed of Chrisman, Sanford, Rolt, Mar-
tin, and Thompson, in addition to Robin-
son, presented the number announced
showed in a striking manner the wis-
dom showed by John ‘Sousa in the prom-
inente he gave to his saxophone section.

After deftly avoiding collision with
string bass and music stand, the college
quartet, composed of Morris, first tenor,
from Winston-Salem; McClannahan,
second tenor, from Pittsburgh, Pa.;
Tucker, baritone, from High Point; and
Morgan, from Miami, Fla. arrived be-
fore the “mike”. From their well-trained
throats came forth the humorous and
ever-pleasing strains of “Shortenin’
Bread,” a “special favorite with college
audiences.” :

After that came the Glee Club's inter-
pretation of “The Old Road”, by John
Prindle Scott, followed by another Saxo-
phone number, again a Sousa composi-
tion, “The Stars and Stripes Forever.”
Next the Glee Club sang a piece which
they have familiarized to all Davidson
students, “Ye Watchers and Ye Holy
Ones”, “a German melody of the 17th
century and an early example of contra-
puntal vocalization.”

Announcement was then made of the
fact that the annual candle light Christ-
mas service of the Y. M. C. A. and the
musical organizctions of the college
would broadcast from the auditorium at
seven-thirty o’clock on Sunday night,
Dec. 16th. Mention of the popularity of
this program, witnessed last year by
1200 persons, was made.

After a joint rendition by the Glee
Club and the Salon Orchestra of the
“Gloria” from Mozart’s “Twelfth Mass”,
these two organizations united in the sig-
nature, “O Davidson’, as announcer
Brown, with a plea that letters of con-
structive criticism of the college pro-
grams be sent to Prof. Pfohl, bade his
unseen audience “a very pleasant good-
night” until another Friday evening rolls
around,

last Monday morning, December 10th.
After a drop in temperature Sunday
night, Davidson looked out on a cold
cloudy sky Monday morning. Snow be-
gan to fall about 10:30, and steadily fell
faster, to stop ‘at about four o’clock. Due
to the actual dearth of flakes and to the
comparative warmth of the ground, the
snow stayed but a few hours.

Latest Pictures Of Deacon Contest
Shown To A aa

In order to help the football players
to profit by their actual mistakes, the
Athletic Association and the Alumni As-
sociation combined to buy a motion
camera for the college.

The latest subject to be “shot” was
the Davidson-Wake Forest game on
Thanksgiving Day. During the course
of the game, Bill Lyons took about five
hundred feet of film pictures, and, as
they turned out exceptionally well, these
pictures present a very revealing account
of many of the more exciting plays of
the game.

The pictures were shown to the Quad-
rangulars Club on Thursday night, and,
the coaches having seen them already,
they will be shown to the football team
in the near future. They will be shown
to the alumni in the spring.

Brown Speaks At
Pledge Gathering

A feed was given by the Kappa Alpha
Fraternity of the pledges of the other
Fraternities in order that they might
get acquainted easier, on Wednesday
night, December 5.

An interesting talk was given by Pro-
fessor C. K. Brown on the fraternities.
One of his various statements was: “Al-
though you are lucky in being pledged to
a Fraternity, there are many good men
who failed to become a Fraternity man
for different reasons; and for this rea-
son you shouldn't think that you are the
salt of the earth.” He also explained the
purpose of the Phi Beta Kappa and how
the men were chosen, and mentioned a
few of the honorary Fraternities. After
his’ talk the refreshments were served
and a general discussion was held.

The Sorosis Club held its regular
meeting Friday night at the home of Mrs.
J. J. Withers. Mrs. N. T. Smith
