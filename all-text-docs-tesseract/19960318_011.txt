PROFILE BGONg SHOWALTER

Sophomore singer earns
first in state competition

By CuHap FOGLEMAN
Staff Writer

Abigail Showalter confesses,

“T didn’ tthink much of voice” upon
entering Davidson last year, “but
now I’m a music major!” The
sophomore from Lewisburg, Penn-
sylvania recently placed first (tied,
actually) in the National Associa-
tion of Teachers of Singing state-
wide competition held at Meredith
College in Raleigh.

In earning her first in the col-
legiate sophomore women’s divi-
sion, Showalter was judged against
singers from schools throughout
North Carolina, including large
universities such as Appalachian

and East Carolina and North Caro-

lina School of the Arts.

Diane Thorton, Showalter’s
voice instructor, marvels, “there is
quite a bit of talent floating around
" among these 1500 would-be doc-
tors and lawyers.” Three years
ago, Thorton began at Davidson
teaching only three students; to-
day, the vocal program has “‘mush-
roomed,” Students are choosing to
sing “challenging classical pieces
as opposed to Broadway, and han-
dling it very well,” notes Thorton.

Each contestant prepared a
repertoire of four pieces;
Showalter, accompanied on the

Abigail Showalter.

Abigail Showalter

pianc by freshman Aaron Lesher,
chose for her first piece Puccinni’s
“O Mio Babbino Caro,” and the
judges selected “Wie Melodien
Zieht Es” by Brahms and Argento’s
“Diaphenia” for the remaining
three.

Last year (in her freshman
debut) Showalter placed third and
advanced to the regional contest.
Unfortunately, she is ‘unable to

make this year’s trip to Maryland

and compete ata higher level. Still,.

for Showalter, who’s also a mem-
ber of Davidson’s Chamber and
Concert Choirs, the singing is
what’s “fun.”

Beonthe lookout for BachFest
‘96 at the end of this month, when

you can catch Abigail and the rest:

“Small World” pieces
together new order

By ANNA Kemp
Guest Writer

The Davidson College Union
Gallery committee is currently ex-
hibiting 18 collages by artist David
Kamm in the Union Gallery.
Kamm uses original woodcuts,
lithographs and etchings to create
his works which are part of his
touring exhibition, “Pages from a
Small World.”

He says the exhibition “com-
bines various aspects of two dif-
ferent media. Printmaking —
woodcuts, lithographs and etch-
ings — provides the basic visual
vocabulary and lends specific types
of marks and surfaces to the work.

It also offers a format of sequential.

image manipulation whichis char-
- acteristic of many print processes.”

“Collage incorporates actual
objects into the finished work, in
this case the reality of previously
existing prints. It also contributes
unexpected juxtapositions through
the deconstruction and reconstruc-
tion of forms which search for sig-
nificance other than that of surface
appearance. -

“T have come increasingly to
believe that it is not coincidence
that these works are created in a
culture which threatens increasing
fragmentation, where a bombard-
ment of bits and pieces is meant to
substitute for the whole, and frag-

bs

ments represent totalities, where
each person is left to bring order
out of chaos the best they can.”

Visual Arts Center printmaking
studio Thursday, March 21, at7:30
p.m. This workshop is free and
