Rendered Valuable Service
For College

Mr. R. M. Miller, Jr., of the class of
1876, died in Atlantic City Sunday after-
noon, October 11th, at five o’clock. The
daily press has carried an extended ac-
count of his successful business career.
Here it is wished to record something of
his interest in and enthusiasm for his
Alma Mater.

Mr. Miller was elected president of
the Alumni Association at the commence-
ment meeting in May, 1916, and served
until 1922. During his term of service he
was instrumental in reviving interest in
the Alumni Association and making it a
means of coordinating the interest of the
alumni and doing something in a con-
structive way for the college.

In 1918 he endowed a fund to provide
annually the Alumni Freshman medal
given to the member of the Freshman
class making the highest scholastic
record. In 1920 he was elected by the
Alumni Association as a trustee of the
college, but declined to serve, requesting
that he be relieved of this responsibility.

Mr. Miller was general chairman of
the Six Hundred Thousand Dollar Cam-
paign Fund, giving liberally of his time
and splendid business talent to the pro-
motion and work of the campaign and
he was likewise a liberal cupporter and
provided a Memorial Room in the New
Chambers buldng.

A letter came to the college from Mr.
Mller within the past ten days in which
he stated that next commencement would
be the fiftieth anniversary of his class
and that he was already planning for a
re-union of his class and that he had
plans revolving in his mind that would
be of interest to the college.

In the passing of Mr. Miller Davidson
has lost a staunch friend anda most loyal
and devoted alumnus.

The college was represented at the
funeral by members of the faculty and
officers of the institution.

Mr. F. 1. Jackson,

Davidson, N. C. |

Dear Mr. Jackson: |
T hiven't heard anything of the Alma |

Mater in quite a while,
the Davidsonian today, as T am always
interested in any Davidson news.

IT am vice-president of the
pany and we are now where we can
look around us after being in the hole
for a long time and we hope to be-firmly
established in three or four months. No
doubt you have heard of the Florida
boom and we are IT as we are in the
middle of it here. By IT I mean Miami
as it now comprises 350,000 persons while
it had 29,000 when I was in school and
is growing fast. If you ever have the
opportunity of coming down this way I
would be pleased to show you around
the city.

Best regards to you and the college.

G. D. Fleming, Jr.

DAVIDSON WILDCATS WIN

las the Wildcats.

The Quakers, although outplayed in nearly
every respect, put up a scrappy game and
fought hard the entire time. They succeeded
in making only one first down, while Davids-
son garnered 12. But in the punting game
the Quakers averaged practcally the same

gained over six times as much as did*those
of Guilford.

The game was cleanly fought, there being
a few penalties and these far between.

added the extra point with dropkick
squarely between the bars. This ended the|
scoring for the day. |

In the last quarter the varsity entered into |
the game for three minutes and failed to gain |
as consistently as the second team had been‘
able to do. But they were soon replaced by |
other reserves who finished the game. |

The game gave great promise of future |
Wildcat teams. Allen, Leggette, Harrison,
Ritchie and Grey, all with one or more years
at Davidson, showed up exceedingly well. |
The punting of Leggette and also neat gains |
torn off through the line brought him once |
more into the limelight. Harrison’s brilliant |
broken field running was easily the sensation |
of the day. Allen was on the job at offense,
and his defense work was also worthy of
note. At one time he intercepted a Quaker
pass with one hand that would have gone for
a nice gain had it been completed.

In the line, Grey, the newly found guard,
kept up his good work and frequently smear-
ed the plays of his opponents. Maulden, at
the other guard, also played well. Ritchie
tore through the Guilford lines several times
and threw the backs for a loss. He also
starred in a new role, his kick-off after the
touchdown in the third quarter going far
down the field, a kick worthy of Dick Grey
himself.

In the Guilford line Captain Warrick, at

a

center, was in every play on the defense and
