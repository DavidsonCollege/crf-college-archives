Students, alumni, faculty, players, and friends of Davidson College joined in
a chorus echoing the victory refrain, a 16-7 win over Wofford last Saturday, but few
probably know that “Davidson's greatest effort in over six years” materialized on
a golf course two days before.

A custom of the coaching

attempts.

Since things turned out so

were only the three plays of
many spectacular plays, of-,

accounted for 16 points.

It was somewhere around the
thirteenth hole that it was de-
cided to employ coach Tom
Stevens’ theory’ to thwart the
potent Wofford offense. Basical-
ly, it was to stop its main re-
ceiver and check end = runs
which had proved fatal too often
in previous scraps. “4
