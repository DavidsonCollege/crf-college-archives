THE DAVIDSONIAN

Page Three

Question of
The Week

The Davidson Campus,

on Sat-
urday night is almost completely
vacant. Probably the reason for

this is that there is practically noth-
thing for those who want to stay
here to do. “In what way can we
as students improve the social life
here on the campus on Saturday
Night?” Here are a few opinions
on the matter.

But, the only trouble
is that this social life has been most-
ly off the campus. A new gym, a
social center, or a revision of

lution. If the administration has

the hypocritical

or for the construction of a build-
ing given over to a combination of
athletic events and social life, I
think that an additional fee should
be added to the Student Activities
tax to take care of it. A round of
parties, banquets, picnics, hayrides,
etc., could be given with the funds
provided by this allotment.

Many a small dance given by any
of the multitude of organizations
we have here on the campus could
be easily staged in the present
gym, if our trustees would awake
to the fact that they were young
once, that social life is good for
young people, that it is only a nor-
mal process, and that most civiliz-

ed, genteel, and cultivated people
approve of dancing as a_ social
medium.

Charlie Robinson, Sophomore:

I would like to see more indoor
sports on the campus such as we
now have at the Y. Alsa games
like badminton and shuffleboard:
These would add a great deal to
the average students enjoyment of
weekends and should probably cause
many more boys than, at present,
do remain on the campus for week-
ends, to do so.

Bill MacLauchlin, Senior:

One thing that I should like to
see is a free movie, or perhaps one
which carries the tariff of one thin
dime. I would’nt want it as long as
the regular full-run feature, but
more as relaxing and different en-
tertainment, It might be that a
half-hour of swing music would
serve to rest and refresh the tired
and lonely. However, ‘this carries
the difficulty of keeping Joe Barn-
well and company on the campus
for these Sat. nite sessions. One
thing that I have always dreamed
about has been the possibilities that
the golf course presents. It strikes
me as a natural setting for a weiner
roast or some campfire program.
At least this would be different.
The best thing that I can concoct,
however, is the idea that no profes-
sor assign any homework fort Mon-
day classes, and there would thus
be no problem of social entertain-
ment on the Davidson campus.

Jim McCrary, Junior:

About. the only thing that can be
said about social life on this campus
on Saturday night is that there sel-
dom is any, When faced with the
question of improving said condi-
tion, we are confronted with the ty-
cle: “There can be no social life
at Davidson on the typical Satur-
day night because no one is here,
and no one wants to stay here be-
cause there is no entertainment to
speak of.” If every one would
promise to stay on the campus some
Saturday night, maybe Ralph Wil-
liams could get up an amateur show,
or some other snazzy entertain-
ment that he is planning, as Social
Chairman of the Y. However, it
would sure have to be some super-
duper affair to win over the “call
of the wild hair.” Or maybe we
shouldn’t compete with the big
dealers,, but have the shows, weiner
roasts, or what have you, just for
those who wouldn’t stray so far
anyway. A concert by Barnwell’s
band with a few tricks by the ma-
gician would be another suggestion.

Pat Williams, Sophomore:

If we want to improve the social
conditions on the campus on Satur-
day night. I'd like to see several
things done. I think we ought to
have a big square dance out on the
lawn in front of Chambers some
night when it’s warmer. However,
it presents the problem of getting
girls on the campus, and this would
be inconvénient for a good many
boys who can’t get rides. There are
