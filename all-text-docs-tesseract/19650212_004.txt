MRS. CHARLEEN WHISNANT
Expounds On Pound

Lamented Mrs. Whisnant of
her college days, ‘‘At Meredith
and then at UNC, everyone we
talked about was dead.” Judg-
ing from her own remarks, the
campus visitor settled on an
interest in Ezra Pound largely
because he had not expired.

On a hasty decision, young
Charleen journeyed with a box
of candy to Washington, D. C.
to get‘a first-hand look at Pound.

noted, “My Baptist momma
used to say, ‘When you visit the
sick or the crazy you take

' Candy, ..°”*

Charleen made note of the
fact that Pound was in a ward
of sex criminals, a fact which
detracted somewhat from her
peace of mind. Before Mrs.
Dorothy Pound arrived, she had
been offered and had nervously
accepted a peanut butter-fig
sandwich.

Mrs. Whisnant digressed from

' her personal narrative to give

Pound’s biographical _ back-
ground. After firmly establish-
ing his reputation as a man of
letters, she noted, he became
interested in economics.

He decided, after observation
and reading, that the world’s
problems could be placed at the
feet of usury and usury, of

course, at the feet of the Jews.

Pound became interested in
Mussolini and made broadcasts
fram Rome attacking the dan-
gers of the New Deal. He was
declared persona non grata by
the United States and at the
conclusion of the war was con-
fined in a cage in one corner
of a prison of war camp for
three months.

Broken by this ordeal the

poet was declared “unfit for

trial” and confined to an asy-
lum. Always a patron of young

five or six talented young peo-|

ple while thus confined: he was ’

constantly visited by respected
men of letters... and Charleen.

Esquire took up Pound's de-
fense and finally in 1958, he
was released and cleared of
treason. Deciding to go back to
Italy, he invited Charleen to ac-
company him. But as she re-
lated it, ‘‘I was 14 months preg-
nant at the time and it was out
of the question. . .”’

Says the editor, ‘‘We wanted

high time to give an argument
to Wiliam Faulkner’s myth that

Clark explained thet the
theme has been broadly in-
terpreted in the belief that
every true ertist has some-

; thing akin to a poetic vision.

In this year’s Festival are
nearly all the fine arts, in
cluding poetry, music, the
drama, painting, and the cine
ma. Reports Clark, “The idea
of the Festival is to concen-
trate student attention on the
various events sponsored by
the Fine Arts Department.”

The Festival began Monday
with a chapel talk by Charleen
Whisnant, Charlotte poet and
confidante of Ezra Pound. The
only other chapel speech in-
cluded in the series will be
Dr. Lesley Frost’s appearance
on Feb. 25. Miss Frost is the
daughter of the late Robert
Frost, and is also a poet in
her own right.

Also included in the Fes-
tival will be the Drama Depart-
ment’s production of Jean
Anouilh’s comedy, Thieves’
Carnival, on Feb. 18, 19, and
20. The Film Friends Commit-
tee will also present three
classic movies, D. W. Griffith's
Birth of a Nation on Feb. 22
