Ticket sales
lower than
past shows

By BLEVIN SHELNUTT
Senior Staff Writer

For the College Union’s spring
concert, Ben Folds will perform in
Belk Arena this Friday at 8 p.m.
David Beckeley will open for the
concert. ;

Approximately 675 Davidson stu-
dents, faculty, and staff, along with
650 community members have pur-
chased tickets to the show, making
the total quantity of tickets sold 1,375
out of 3,000.

Union Director William Brown
expects to sell another 400 to 800 by
the end of the week.

The Union sold approximately
3,300 tickets for John Mayer, over
4,000 tickets for Dave Matthews and
4,500 for Bill Cosby.

Brown speculates that that if it was
not for the two fraternity formals on
Friday night, then student sales for
Ben Folds would surpass those of
John Mayer.

Brown says the Union is satisfied
with ticket sales thus far.

““We’re very pleased. We are very
close to our projections,” he said.
“The sales this week will tell, but we
are on target to stay in budget if we
sell another 200 tickets, and we will
surely do that.”

The decision to get Ben Folds was
a result of several factors, including
scheduling availability, price, and
student responses to concert prefer-
ence surveys given throughout the se-
mester.

In the final survey given to stu-
dents, 700 said they would definitely

Cable confirmed for fall

By Bair McGraw
Senior Staff Writer

Cable television will be available
in every residence hall room next se-
mester, as RLO has finally decided
on a suitable provider.

The situation was “a whole lot
more complicated than we had an-
ticipated,” but RLO believes they
have found a good solution, said
Dean Leslie Marsicano, Director of
Residence Life.

The cable service will be provided
by Campus TeleVideo, a company
that works with colleges and univer-
sities.

Campus TeleVideo buys satellite
television from providers such as
DIRECTV and then repackages the
channels for colleges.

There will be 55 channels avail-
able, including two channels origi-
nating on campus.

“One channel might be devoted to
academics, the other might be de-
voted to student life,” among other
things, said Marsicano. Student pro-
gramming is another possibility.

Because thecollege could not find
a subscriber willing or able to pro-
vide cable ona subscription basis, the
cable will be provided to all rooms
as part of the room rent.

The cable is expected to cost each
student an extra $10 to $15 every
month.

Although service will be available
in the residence hall rooms next se-
mester, Martin Court must wait until

spring 2005 due to the difficulty of

wiring the apartments. Cable will
likely only be available in the living

rooms.

Adelphia will continue to provide
service to Martin Court until the
changeover.

Students seemed to be either en-
thusiastic or indifferent about the de-
cision.

“Tm pretty excited about it since
I didn’t have it this year,” said Jay
Chitty ’07. “It’s a pain only having
two TV’s for five floors |in
Richardson]}.”

Of the rent rate increase Chitty
said, “It’s not a problem. It’s a small
price to pay.”

Jeff Wright’07 said, “I think [have
enough distractions already, and my
parents probably won’t notice the
[change in rent].”

Jennifer Felder ’07 and Kathleen
Levy ’07 said, “The option to watch
TV in our rooms is nice to have, but
we hope it won’t distract us from our
studies.”

About the rent change, each agreed
that “the students should have the
option to decide if they want to pay
for cable.”

After approving the cable decision
earlier this semester, President
Bobby Vagt and the college decided
on several criteria in choosing a pro-
vider, including subscriber based
service and the decision not to use
any Davidson College funds.

No company met all the criteria
the college started out with, however.

“We really do appreciate President
_Vagt’s flexibility,” said Marsicano,
as some of the criteria had to be re-
laxed.

Is grade inflation a threat?

Registrar's records show little evidence of higher grades

“Hoping Harvard’s trend of
graduating 90 percent of its stu-
dents with honors will work its way
to Davidson? Not bloody likely.
Grade inflation does not exist at
Davidson. Atall. But the adminis-
tration keeps battling away against
it, just in case.”

Many students’ perceptions of
the phenomena knownas grade in-
flation may be colored by this defi-
nition entry of Davidson
buzzwords in the Wildcat Hand-
book, the guide distributed to ev-
ery first-year student.

A slightly more accepted ac-
count from the Texas Education
Review reads: “Grade inflation, by
definition, involves arise in grades

Does Davidson’s GPA,
rigor help or hinder grads?

In the last 20 years, while
Davidson GPAs have not risen sig-
nificantly, the available statistics
show that GPAs at other leading
institutions have. This disparity
raises concerns that some
Davidson students will be disad-
vantaged in the job market or in
graduate schools. Faculty and ad-
ministrators downplayed the im-
portance of GPA in determining
one’s post-collegiate prospects.

Mike Galdo ’04 said,“‘I believe
that it is easier to have a 3.5 at
Harvard than a 3.15 at Davidson.

schools will drool over that

time, across academic depart-
ments or among academic institu-
tions.”

Grade inflation has been back
in the national news in a big way
recently. Princeton University re-
cently announced a proposal tocap
the number of A-range grades
given in a department to 35 per-
cent for undergraduate classes.

The Wednesday, April 7 pro-
posal is aresponse to findings that
65 percent of students in the Class
of 2002 have GPAs above B+.
Princeton faculty adopted that pro-
posal, with minor amendments, in
a 156-84 vote on Monday.

the Davidson student will get the
same respect.”

According to John Adams, Di-
rector of Career Services, GPAcan
hurt most at the places that screen
applicants first using only GPA.
He describes this practice in most
cases as the “inappropriate use of
GPA as objective criteria.” GPA
measures classroom performance
rather than workplace perfor-
mance, Adams said. “The research
just hasn’t been done to show the
relationship between them.”
