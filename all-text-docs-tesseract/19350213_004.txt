“TARZAN” SHIREY

One could hardly see for looking in
the Wildcat's lair Saturday with so much
going on to attract the eye. “However,
Felix the gent’man who covers his do-
main like a roof, allowed very little to
escage the range of his peepers, and here
he is to make his report:

“While watching the Wildcat
gridders engage in their first intra-
squad game of the winter practice
session I heard Luther “Tarzan”
Shirey, ' discussing with some of
his. friends the wrestling match
the Davidson team was to hav
with V. P. I. that night. ‘ie
friends began to kid him about the
way in which his much heavier
opponent would tie him into knots
when they met on the mat. ‘‘Tar-
zan’’ took it all quiete philosophi-
cally and presently he replied,
with ’Popeye’-boldness, ‘he'd bet-
ter watch out, boys, cause I eats
my spinach.’ f
“Those were certainly true words ut-

tered by that Wildcat grappler. When
the time came for him to tackle his foe
from V. P. I. Shirey stepped on to the
canvas weighing 155 pounds and the Vir-
ginia lad tipped the scales at 210. It was
really a typical enactment of a “popeye”
bout. Despite Luther's losing the match,
he stayed with the hefty grunter for ten
minutes and prevented him from scoring
a fall, which would have given the gob-
blers another two points.

“Shirey was wrestling in the
unlimited weight replacing Cap-
tain Charlie Fort, who went to the
infirmary a week ago with the

mumps. Discrediting neither
Shirey nor his opponent, I feel
reasonably confident that Fort.

could have taken the measure of

the unlimited grappler from V. P.

L., in which case Davidson would

have been victorious. But that is

only what might have been.”
MEET AGAIN

~“Pwo loyal Wildcat supporters never
fail to meet on Richardson Field when
there is anything of an athletic nature
going on there. They are Dr. Albert
Sidney Johnson, pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church in Charlotte, and Mr.
Joe Johnston, President of the Davidson
Alumni Association, and Superintendent
of Barium Springs Orphanage. Saturday
was no exception. ‘The Alumni Presi-
dent arrived first, but soon afterward Dr.
Johnson entered the stadium and began
to look for his Barium friend.

“It is no longer necessary for
them to make engagements to see
one another, if one desires to con-
sult the other all he must do is
come to Davidson and in all prob-
ability find him awaiting on Rich-
ardson Field.

“They both have sons on the Davidson
football squad. so their interest is not
unwarranted, and even if this wasn’t the
case their support is heartily welcomed
by the Wildcats.”

PIKA GAGERS

“Every man in the starting lineup for
the Wildcat cagers Saturday night when
they met Elon is a member of the Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity. This combina-
tion works plenty smoothly ‘too. Perhaps
the mutual fraternal affiliation is an in-
centive to better team work.

“I was told not many days past
by a backfield star on a certain
prominent southern football team
that on his club he had to. make
his own way when it was his turn
to carry the ball unless there were

SHIREY REPLACES FORT

Davidson Gets Two Falls And
One Time Advantage

V. P. I. defeated the Davidson mat-
men last Saturday night in the local gym
by gaining four time advantages and one
fall in the eight matches while the David-
son grapplers won two falls and one time
advantage. The final score was 17 to
13.

The match was exciting throughout
and the outcome was not decided until
the tinal bout. between Dailey of V. P. I.
and Shirey of Davidson, the former win-
ning by time advantage. Captain Charles
Fort is in the infirmary with a case of
mumps and was unable to join his team-
mates against the Gobblers. The absence
of Fort put the Wildcats at a tremendous
disadvantage, forcing Shirey to fight out
of his class against a man who out-
weighed him:some forty or fifty pounds.
This was the first defeat Davidson has
suffered during the current season,

V. P. I. brought a strong team to
Davidson which are worthy representa-
tives of that school’s reputation in wrest-
ling fame. Coach Tilson has developed
a group of skillful, cool-headed, matmen
who have enjoyed a successful tour
through North Carolina. The Gobbler
wrestlers are particularly adept at tying
up their opponents arms, causing them no
little difficulty.

Parker, 135 Ib.
work of his man,

Wildcat, made short
He applied a punish-
ing head scissors to Allison in the open-
ing moments of their bout and in three
minutes Allison was pinned to the mat.
Parker, in his first year of varsity com-
petition has shown marked ability and
his aggresisve determination is likely to
carry him far in the game. Quarterman,
veteran Wildcat grappler, showed com-
plete mastery over his opponent, winning
by a tall in 5 minutes and 30 seconds.
Leroy Blackwelder defeated Bell of V.
P. I. with a time advantage of 8 minutes.
Blackwelder has remained undefeated
this season and has shown a’ remarkable
degree of improvement since last year.
He is unusually strong and very agile.

Polk Moffatt, Davidson sophomore,
lost a heart-breaker to Evans of V. P. I.
vans pinned Moffatt’s shoulders to the
mat only ten seconds before the whistle
blew ending the match.

The Wildcats journey to Chapel Hill
Thursday to meet the Carolina team.
Later in the season a match has been
scheduled with State.

BRIGHT GRID HOPES
“Coaches ‘Doc’ Newton and
Gene McEver are rounding into
shape a lot of powerful promising .
looking football candidates these
days. The game Saturday was a
little ragged for the most part, but
‘there's gold in them thar hills,’
and the Wildcat mentors are
rapidly mining and molding it into
attractive ornaments for the Wild-
cat eleven.
“The Davidson grid aggregation of
1935 should be a superior eleven to the
one last season, and you may lay to

that.”

Reid, Barrow, And Kieswetter
Outstanding Kitten Loopers On
Virginia Prep School Invasion

Last Saturday afternoon Coach Grier
Martin’s Wildkitten basketeers defeated
the Darlington Tigers 38-31 on the local
court. They exhibited a greatly im-
proved offense which enabled them to
maintain a fairly comfortable lead
throughout and win handily. y

Captain Wade Barrow, Dan Iverson,
and Reid led the local attack with eleven,
nine, and eight points respectively. Kies-
wetter also played well.

Byars and Trotter were outstanding
for the visitors. The former was high
scorer with thirteen points to his credit,
and his all-around play was of high cali-
ber. Trotter displayed a deadly eye for
the basket, caging four shots from well
behind the foul line. ‘

The Kittens returned Friday from a
successful invasion of Virginia prep

school circles. Monday afternoon the
yearlings reached Lynchburg and prac-
ticed in the Virginia Episcopal School
gym. “Tuesday night they played a
strong team from Augusta Military
Academy and the*Kittens were beaten
by a score of 34-22, The following night
they defeated Fishburne Military Acad-
emy at Waynesboro 34-30. Woodberry
likewise bowed to the Kittens by a score
of 24-16. Coach Martin said his team
played brilliant basketball on the trip,
showing up mitch better than they have
been on the home court.

Players making the trip were Barrow,
Iverson, and Kieswetter, forwards; Reid,
Harris and Moyer, guards; and Rhine-
hardt and Cline, centers. Reid, Barrow,
and Kieswetter were outstanding for the
Kittens.

Their play Saturday showed much im-
provement over their last showing here
a fortnight ago against the Tar Babies
of Carolina.

Davidson Team To Meet Wake
Forest Quintet In Raleigh,
Wednesday

Fresh from three straight victories of
the past week, the 1935 edition of Wild-
cat cagers swing around the Old North
State this week and by the time this
humble page has gone to press will have
played Duke University, who defeated
them by a small margin early in the sea-
son.

Tonight they take on the Tar Heel
team from the University of North Caro-
lina, leaders of the Southern Conference
and previous victors over Davidson by a
score of 36-26.

Saturday night the basketball team
will play High Point College, leaders of
the Little Six, and resting for a few days,
play Wake Forest Wednesday at Raleigh.

Having. won 10 and lost 6, the first
time in a few yeats that a Wildcat bas-
ketball team Has been so favored, the
team bids fair to make it three out of
four on this invasion, despite the quality
of opposing teams,

Carolina is the Southern Conference
leader and Duke is second. In recent
games, Duke has beaten Carolina and
has beaten Army which also beat Caro-
lina, Yet the Blue Devils were able to
vanquish the ‘Cats by only a four point
margin in early season while the Heels
made it 10,

High Point College is at present top-
ping the percentage column in the Little
Six and should offer tough opposition.
The Deacons have not done so well, hav-
ing yet to break in the win column, They
lost 40-25 to Duke and humbled them-
selves before Carolina by an 18 point
margin.

Davidson Matmen Plan
Meet At Chapel Hill

Davidson's wrestling team will have its
third match against college competition
when the Wildcats meet the Carolina
grapplers at Chapel Hill Friday night.

The Wildcat team will leave Davidson
Thursday night and will probably return
Saturday. It is still uncertain whether
Captain Fort will be able to wrestle Fri-
day night, but in case he is unable, Law-
rence Quarterman will act as captain and
Luther Shirey will wrestle in the un-
limited class. Other than these, there are

Monday Is Last Day New Track
«Candidates Can Report
For Practice

Captain Norton G, Pritchett, director
of athletics and track coach, has announ-
ced that anyone who wishes to come out
for track should report by next Monday
at the latest, except those who are out
for winter sports. Pritchett stated that
men who haven't taken any part in the
conditioning work of winter track would
not be allowed to participate in spring
track.

Captain Pritchett also stated that the
team needed anyone who thinks he has
any ability along these lines, especially
in sprints, since none of last year's
sprinters have returned to school this
year.

The track candidates have been prac-
ticing since exams were over, and are
rapidly getting into shape for several in-
door meets which have been scheduled,

Davidson will send a team to the
indoor meet to be held in Charlotte next
Monday night. This meet will be an in-
vitational affair and only those will be
sent who have turned in good marks in
the past. Earle Frazier will be sent and
also probably Johnny Lee, Archie Mc-
Fadyen, Billy Merchant, and perhaps a
hurdler and a sprinter. Davidson will
also be represented by a team at the
Southern Conference indoor meet at
Chapel Hill on March 9.

The Wildcats this year have the fullest
outdoor track schedule in the history of
this sport here.

practically no other changes in the line-
up.

The Carolina team has a group of
skillful and aggressive wrestlers, who will
be a real threat to the local grapplers.
In the Carolina-V. P. I. match, the for-
mer team was victorious, so according to
comparative scores, which are in no way
reliable, Carolina has the edge over
Davidson. If the local wrestlers are vic-
torious in the match Friday night, David-
son meets State for the State champion-
ship.

The following is a tentative line-up of
the Davidson team for the Carolina
match: Moffett, 118 Ibs; Allen or
Thompson, 126 lbs; Parker, 135 Ibs;
Owens 145 Ibs.; Quarterman, 155 Ibs.;
Hodgin, 165 lbs.; Blackwelder, 175 Ibs.;
and Shirey, unlimited.

WHITES EXE OUT
WIN OVER REDD

Muddy Field Mars . Passes
Practice Clash Saturday
; Afternoon

Davidson's football candidates, now
participating in winter gridiron exercises,
went through a practice game last Sat-
urday on Richardson Field to feature a
7-6 victory by the “Whites” over the
“Reds”.

The winning tally came as results of
a play in which Paul Pittman of the
Reds, on the point of being mobbed by
a host of Whites, heaved the pigskin
through the air in a forlorn attempt to
allay a 15-yard loss, only to have it in-
tercepted by “Teeny” Lafferty, who im-
mediately checked out on a 60-yard jaunt
to the promised land. Hack Sanders ac-
counted for the point, which later proved
the winning margin. :

In the last few minutes of the game,
the Reds, who had worked themselves
deep into enemy territory, took advantage
of the Whites “closed in” pass defence,
with Pittman twirling the oval through
the ether to Fields Young, elongated end
for the final score of the game. Pitt-
mans’ kick for extra point was blocked.

Due to a wet field, numerous fumbles
occurred to add to the ragged appear-
ance of the teams. This was caused to
a great extent, by the fact that several
shifts have been made by Coaches New-
ton and McEver in order to plug up the
holes made by the graduation of Hand,
Fort, Lee, Morgan, Potter, Siewers,
Batte, Brewer, Wingfield, Mackorell, and
Hutchins.

Consequently, with this factor staring
them in the face, the coaches have made
several changes, particularly the follow-
ing: Ed Armfield, formerly at Tackle,
has now taken position in the backfield;
Morris Freeman, 200 pound tackle, is
being tried at right end, and Dick Cathey
has been put at the pivot position.
Hogan, Lafferty, Denis, and Harrison,
all rising Sophomores, looked particularly
good in Saturdays scrimmage and will
be relied, wpon next fall as replacements
for the famous pony backs of '34,

Dick Johnson, Tom Corbin, and Bud
Hunter, performed in expected fashion,
while “Chief

Katwonk” Sanders served respectively as

Baxter Yarborough and

mainstays in the backfields of the Reds
and Whites.

“Pinkie” Stowe, rising sophomore who
recently reported for practice, provided
one of the highlights of Saturday with
his ardent and enthusiastic “scrimmage”
with the new Blocking machine. Stowe

should prove ample replacement for

“Tubby” Hand in the line.

The lineup for Saturday's scrimmage
was as follows:

Whites Reds

McClung LG Vass

Cat Cagers Take Pair
Of Hard Fought Games

Basketball Team Defeats Char-
lotte “Y’’ 35-31 In Game At
Paw Creek

JIM MORGAN STARS

Loopsters Eke Out 45-43 Win
Over Elon Christians

Continuing their custom of winning
or losing games by a margin of only a
few points, the Wildcat basketeers added
two more hard earned victories*to their
record last week.

On Thursday night of last week they
met the Charlotte Y. M. C. A. quintet at
Paw Creek and won by the narrow mar-
gin of 35-31. The game was close all
the way through, neither team being able
to gain a safe lead. At the half David-
son held a slight lead of three points
and managed to hang on to it throughout
the remainder of the game.

Charlie Harris was the high scorer
of the game with a total of twelve points.
Bill Quick also contributed a great deal
to the Wildcat victory. For the Char-
lotte Y, Edwards was the star, well sup-
ported by Fort and others. Edwards is
a former U. N, C. athlete who is now
coaching at Paw Creek.

On last Saturday the Wildcats eked
out the other victory in a free-scoring
battle with Elon College by a three point
margin, 46-43. This contest also turned
out to be a nip and tuck affair, the final
result of which was in doubt until the
last minute. A large crowd of specta-
tors witnessed the game, which was part
of last Saturday's feature athletic pro-
gram, in which four squads, participated _
in three different sports to make the oc-
casion the most complete program ever
put.on so far this year in the local gym.

“Big Jim” Morgan, star Davidson cen--
ter, made a sensational scoring spurt in
the first half, ringing up a total of ten
points in that period, only to subside in
the second half and finish the game with-
out adding but one other point. Roye of
Elon was the high scorer of the game
with a total of sixteen points marked
down to his credit. Smith’s play for the
visiting team was also outstanding.

Lineups for the Elon game were:
