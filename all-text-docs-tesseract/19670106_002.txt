Brotherly Obsolescence

A century ago, a new phenomenon.
the fraternitv, began emerging on
Southern college campuses. At the
time. the concept of brotherhood with-
in a small cohesive group of 10 or so
men was viable and meaningful.

But in the intervening 100 years.
the ‘adventures in brotherhood” have
grown into a giant business with huge
budgets and fulltime staffs. operating
out of infamous national offices.

Few Davidson fraternity men are
ignorant of the demands the national
office places on local chapters, all in
the name of the brotherhood-at-large.
Such programs as elaborate buildings
to house the national headquarters.
full-time staffs of executive secreta-
ries. field secretaries and stenograph-
ic secretaries. loan funds and scholar-
ships drain the local chapters. It’s not
unusual for Davidson fraternities to
pav $2.500 or more a year into the
coffers of the national office, all in
the name of the national brotherhood.

In return, they receive little more
than harassment for failing to turn in
reports on time and an occasional free
bed in a house when a brother visits a
strange town.

Whether or not brotherhood can ex-
ist in a group of 40 to 60 people eating
together daily is a moot question. But
the idea of brotherhood binding to-
gether thousands of undergraduates

and countless more alumni, few of
whom have ever seen each other, is so
ridiculous that it doesn’t even merit.
discussion.

It. is conceivable that the name and
reputation of a national fraternity
might help local chapters at some
schools. but at Davidson, the central
organization does little for locals oth-
er than take money and stifle initia-

tive.

Most fraternity men here acknowl-
edge the anachronism national frater-
nities represent and yet are reluctant
to break the ties with the mother
group. The usual explanation is a sin-
gle fraternity's fear of being alone in
its move. with possible detrimental
repercussions in rush.

The obvious solution lies in concert-
ed action by the entire fraternity
court. In doing so, no single fraternity
could be adversely affected. The ob-
vious locus for such action should be
in the Interfraternity Council, where
representatives could maintain a liai-
son between the rest of the court and
individual members.

The move for local autonomy would
have a doubly beneficial effect: Not
only would local chapters find them-
selves in an improved situation, the
college’s reputation would be boosted
by moving away from an anachronistic
system.

Change: Will It Come?

When the disciplinary case involv-
ing a student found under the influ-
ence of alcohol triggered last month
a shortlived discussion of the faculty’s
policy on drinking, a minor change
was made in the wording of the pun-
ishment against drinking infractions.
giving a wider range of disciplinary
actién.

At the time, the faculty’s action was
understood to be an interim policy,
until a detailed examination of the en-
tire drinking situation could be under-
taken. But since that time, the only
action resulting from the discussion
has been an announcement that en-
forcement will be more stringently en-
forced—not a word about looking into
possible changes in the existing rule.

Realism alone should force a reex-
amination of the present policy. which
is virtually unenforceable without
ruinous consequences. President D.
Grier Martin was quoted last month
in THE DAVIDSONIAN as saying that
the increase in security personnel and
the drinking rule should not be taken
“as a sort of public relations thing”
for the benefit of parents and trustees.
It is inconceivable that such a thought
should even occur, for if the adminis-
tration is willing to take the steps nec-
essary to enforce the rule, in particu-
lar, room searches, the result would
be anvthing but public relations, at
least favorable relations. The result-
ing publicity could do a great deal of
harm to the college's reputation.

There is no getting around the fact
that in any society of mature fhdivid-
uals, there must be a concehSus about
an acceptance of the rules under which
the society lives. The gbvio(ylexcep-
tion is that of a police state. -*'

Maintenance of a dry campus has
always been student enforced, and the
repeal last year of student regulations
does not reduce the necessity of con-
sidering student opinion and feeling
on the matter.

When the college underwent a sim-
ilar trauma over the alcohol question
two years ago, an acceptable solution
was found only by joint conferencés
between students and faculty. Such an
approach is obviously needed now;
procrastination in initiating the study

is only postponing a difficult problem

that must ultimately be faced and
solved.

ROTC’s Lasting Benefits

Elsewhere in this issue is an article
describing the nationwide controversy
over the ROTC program. It is appar-
ently a vital issue at a number of
schools, and has been made even more
so by the nation’s misgivings over the
course the military is carrying out in
Vietnam.

But despite strong feelings of a few
students, there has never been any
strong protest here over the Army's
presence on campus and very little
over the compulsory nature of the
basic program.

In fact, the ROTC program often
appears so attractive to certain stu-
dents (we have in mind certain ath-
letes whose height exempts them from
the program) that they elect to take
the course despite their immunity.

Apparently they feel that the last-
ing benefits derived from the week's
Leadership Laboratory and care and
cleaning of the M1 outweigh those of
other elective courses.

Sloan Opens The Door

Interdepartmental programs in. col-
leges and universities are a dime a
dozen, and despite boasts five years
ago of Davidson’s pioneering with
its Humanities program, such survey
courses of Western Civilization are no
exception.

However, the quarter million dollar
grant from the Sloan Foundation will
enable Davidson to make a valuable
contribution to the interdepartmental
approach to education, for such ven-
tures in the field of the sciences are
virtually unexplored in the twenti-
eth century Knowledge Explosion, in
which scientists in particular have
been forced into more and more nar-
row specialization.

The grant will allow Davidson to be
true pioneers in the field, and a suc-
cessful program could boost the col-
lege’s reputation across the country,
as other schools will consider imple-
menting similar programs.

Indeed. even receiving the grant in-
dicates a certain confidence in David-
son and the college’s proposed inter-
departmental science program. Other
Southern schools are at a premium on
the list of the 20 schools receiving the
prants, and the recipients are all rec-
ognized as being among the leaders in
American education. Many are among
the schools the Blue Sky Committee
will be visiting and studying for ideas
for currculum reform.

The opportunity for such a program

is particularly suited to the small lib-
eral arts college, which obviously
would be unable to produce the spe-
cialist in the first place. By grounding
the student in the history and phi-
losophy of science and the scientific
method, not only is the college pursu-
ing its goal of the liberally educated
man, but it is preparing any student
for a better overall view as he under-
takes the inevitable specialized grad-
uate study.

Belligerent Females

The idea of conscripting women into
military service is nothing new, but at
a recent conference on the draft, an-
thropologist Margaret Mead gave a
novel reason for not sending them
into combat.

Women are just too fierce, Dr. Mead
said. “Men have nice rules, like not
fighting on Christmas,” she added.

The Christian Science Monitor
points out several historic female war-
riors whom Dr. Mead may have had
in mind. Witness Boadicea, the An-
glican queen who sacked three cities
in the first century before her army
was crushed by the Roman oppressors.

Whether or not Dr. Mead’s reason-
ing is valid, she made a valid point:
Women can well serve in such vital,
though not so bellicose, roles as typing
and filing.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Watson Proposes Cure The Gospe
For Coliseum Ticket Ills According

Dear Editor:

Any student who attended
the Davidson-Princeton game
and who sat in the ‘‘student
section’’ can recall the annoy
ing confusion over seating.

The Coliseum management
directed Davidson students to
several sections in the left
mezzanine and told students to
sit anywhere in that area.

But the management also di-
rected non-student ticket hold-
ers to the same sections and
seated these people in their
specific seats. The results—
often a group of friends was
split or a student and his date
were forced to move to a new
seat.

To correct this confusion. .1
have the following sugges-
tions:

1) When selling student .and
date tickets the Athletic Tick
ect Office should sell all tick
ets.in their numerical sequence
and sell each section entirely
before opening a new section.
Thus all seats in a section or
part of:a section would be sold
only to Davidson. students.

2) Clearly mark. these sec-
tions und a partial section as
reserved only for Davidson
students and their dates. Signs
reading ‘“‘Davidson Student
Section” could be used.

3) Once these sections have
‘been determined, allow David-
son students and their dates
to sit anywhere within the de-
lineated . student section.

4) Designate a final day for
picking up tickets that would
be convenient for both stu-
dents and the Coliseum. Thus

\

the Coliseum would have am-
ple time to sell the remainder
of a section that students had
partially filled.

I hope that Dr. Scott and
the Coliseum management will
find these suggestions useful.

‘System’ Victim
Finally Sees Light

Dear Editor:

1 have not the ability of ex-
pression which a number of
my fellow Davidsonians seem
to possess. But I do have a
large amount of pride in Da
vidson and an equal amount
of concern for its future
growth.

And } do have a unique po
sition of being able to view
Davidson from “‘the outside.”
For these reasons I have de
cided that ] must contribute to
the mix which will in the end
hopefully build a better Da-
vidson.

Allow me this’space to tell
of an individual experience.
which will hopefully be of
some aid in the current cur-
riculum revision discussions.

For my freshman and soph-
omore. years, I was probably
as good a follower of ‘the sys-
tem" as any of my colleagues.

I cut only when absolutely
necessary, studied my assign-
ed lessons diligently. got my
assigned papers done and
proofread with time to spare.
‘‘browned’’ my share of pro-

fessors and avoided hall and
house bull sessions (which
only subtracted from the time
which I could more effectively
(?) use memorizing my par-
roted notes).

I thought I had the secret,

But then my bubble—my
ctazy, secure bubble — burst
wide open. Somehow I had de-
cided to spend my junior year
in Germany. The success I
had previously sought hit me
square in the face without its
incognito garb: and I saw at
last the pscudo success that it
actually was. Being a ‘system
man.’ I have tasted the sys-
tem of the German university
and ‘have seen how drab, how
unstjmulating, how utterly
nonsensical the "other sys-
tem" is. “The system’ has
robbed me of individual initia
tive. of. the chance to seek
what I believed. and of the
time to pursue, and to think,
and to discuss: and to act.

I was robbed of time to set:
about studying our. modern
predicaments and atlempting
to do something about them,
if even in a very small, per.
haps insignificant way.

No, time for that was in the
future, after I had my degree,
after successfully completing
graduate school. Then my
chance would come.

But is the world waiting for
me to complete my “formal
education’. and could I ever
really escape from my ‘'sys-
tem” after it had become my
life for so many years?

Many of my colleagues man-
aged to form a compromise
with “‘the system,"" but, as a
result, they sacrificed a much-
needed grade-point average for
a grappling with the prob-
lems of society. But one ‘must
have that grade-point average
to get into graduate school.
after which he will have the
position (by now being ac-
cepted as an authority) to ex-
press his ideas and be listened
to. Therefore, our system goes
forward — stagnating minds
which will later be called on
to lead our society.

But why not progress? The
Germans have a pretty good
idea of how. They seem to
wrestle with the problems of
society and advance to their
degrees at the same time.

But how do they do it? How
can. they possibly be learning
if the professor doesn't make
sure through regular tests?

They do it through matur-
ity. The immature don't make
it; they fall by the wayside.
The mature, the ones who will
eventually lead the immature,
are offered the highest free-
dom to pursue their studies
when and where and how they
please. And they do pursue.

But one says this academic
freedom cannot exist on the
American campus. Why just
look at. the multitudes who
would take advantage of the
new-found freedom to have ua
good time.

The mature, however, will
carry the load in any system
in which they are placed. So
why not give the student a
system in which he can ma-
ture and then advance at his
own mature pace?

New ‘Miscellany’ Offers
‘Bitter-Sweet' Literature

A Review
By SAM DARBY
Statt Writer

The current number of the
MISCELLANY is a_ bilter-
sweet collection of lHterature,
organized and presented plain-
ly and tastefully. The intro-
ductory editorial says that the
absence of a central theme
prohibits any congruence of
the divers parts, and an edi-
tor can only present the pieces
out of context or meaning—
rather like a box of assorted
chocolates. A reviewer is in
the same position—he cannot
criticize the magazine as a
whole. but only select parts
for commendation and con-
struction.

Perhaps the most pleasant-
ly surprising thing about this
issue is the short story by a
freshman, “Wilson Russell's
Suicide.” A very sensitive
piece about a boy's mistrust
of himself. his friends, and
finally his mental effort to re-

join the life he is leaving via
a slit wrist. A very good piece
of primitive fiction.

There are so many poems
written by people our age
which abound with offbeat
similes (‘upon four-legged for-
est clouds the cowboy-angel
rides”), They exude a general
frustration which is depress-
ing. It is always delightful to
find form and meter and
rhyme in young poetry.

“Vivaldi” carries an under-
current of heavy rhythms
much like classical Baroque
music. The unnamed poem by
William Farr, another “new”
writer, has a light Renaissance
grace and yet a tragic theme
of wasted life. “Concerto for
Two" paints two vivid pictures
and then blends them into one
movement of life and music:
“Orsamavedas" reflects Hin-
du and Bhuddist optimism and
faith in the cycle of life.

What does one say about
W. H. Jackson's poetry? Noth-

ing. perhaps. He puts words
together to get sounds and
moods and images, but it is
personal—not only to the poet,
but also to the reader.

**A Senior’ points an accus-
ing finger at some undefined
intellect which dictates to us
our idols and needs, dislikes
and prejudices’ and makes our
existences seem meaningless
compared to the freedom of a
pastoral life. Charles Vick's
searching poem bewails the
Gehenna of philistine South
now dry of the culture and
dignity it once was so proud
of.

The three ‘‘non-literary ar-
ticles — Legette Blythe's on
Thomas Wolfe (not the con-
temporary Tom Wolfe), the
interview with Padraic Colum,
and Rob William's lithograph
are welcome in the Miscel-
lany. They add scope and dig-
nity to the work and pick up
a pace which might otherwise
be dull.

1 MEAN SOMETIMES we just go along, accepting
“things” as they come to us. | mean sometimes we
don’t react to life and when we don't we've cheated
someone, a friend. a parent, our lover, otrselves.
You have to have an answer of some sort to what
happens to you. You can’t just let things pass you
by: at least not the important things. not the things
that you really find always staring at you. These
are. the things that are aiways there unless vou do
something, anything. And you have to answer: it’s
the only way.

A freshman at Davidson, man. | had arrived.
This wasn't just one of those-everyday sort of things.
1 was up there. I had experienced all the usual stuff
and all the things that allowed for a kind of smug
feeling, a feeling secured hy the fact that 1 was en-
titled to a part in a relatively select group. It didn’t
take any talking about; 1 knew there were plenty of
others that had precisely the same type of feelings.
but the point was: I was a part of something pretty
fine, and Davidson was going to make it all much
more of the type of life it had already been.

HOW CAN ANYONE tell a freshman who es-
sentially has “had it ynade” that things will be any
different in the future? Don’t get me wrong; I was
able to rationalize right along with Lucy in “Pea-
nuts” wondering why we can’t have “ups and ups
and ups.” But I wasn’t quite ready for any “downs.”
First of all I was making new. friends at the rate of
275 or so every two or three days; I figure that was
about how long it took one to make the cycle of in-
troductions three or four times... . And man, like
all the rest, I was ready for rush. I “knew” like every-
one else that things could happen and go wrong, but
they never had, and there was no reason to think
that they would at this time.

So it went. Unlucky freshmen today; vou miss
something by not having to know that glorious first
week we experienced. I’m serious, throughout that
first week Davidson was out of this world. We all
pretty much decided where he wanted to pledge and
although we knew something could happen. .. . Well,
they were all really nice guys, and someone would
get you through the “session.” He could make a
speech in the session threatening to resign or some-
things; you’d make it.

EVERYONE was encouraging. Why should you
for a minute really believe there was much hurt in-
volved in college? It was too new and too fast-mov-
ing. The whirl was great. Everyone complained about
the endless dorm rush, and then secretly counted
the notes from “the men.” We'd slip out to play
flickerball secure in the notion that we knew. what
was going on and had things well under control.

I mean most of us didn’t know too much about
fraternities, but they seemed to be a pretty good
way to continue the “in” way of life which most
everyone at Davidson had known. Anyway, anything
that seemed to go wrong always happened to others,
those most of us were used to sympathizing with.
Then suddenly rush was over, and things were really
in pretty good order for the beginning of classes.

THE WALK to pick up the bids was interestin
because I knew what would be there; after all, the

What is important is that Davidson College has
no justification for fostering a system like the pres-
ent fraternity system which can result in such real
hurt as I felt. I'm not really speaking to fraternities;
they are what they are. I’m speaking to you: students,
faculty, administration, trustees, alumni; as long as
only one person is hurt unnecessarily by a part of
the college when something can be done about it
then you are in the wrong.
