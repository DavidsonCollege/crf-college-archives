The campus police department
has replaced an old vehicle for a
more dependable car this year and
‘updated the 911 emergency sys-
tem. However, these changes are
unrelated to the $10 increase in
parking registration.

According to department
records there are 663 cars regis-
tered to be parked on campus. The
extra $6,630 elicited from this
year’s registration will drop di-
rectly into the general school bud-
get rather than increase Police
Department funds.

However, most Davidson stu-
dents do not seem overly concerned
about the increase. Ben Lukey ‘98
says he did not mind paying an
extra $10.

“T was a little surprised, but
it’s not so bad when you consider
the accessibility of parking and the
fact that you are paying for the
entire year,” he says.

The Davidson College Police
Departmentresearched vehicle reg-
istration prices at schools all over
North Carolina. Compared to other
schools in the region, Davidson
either matched or beat most other
schools’ registration costs. Ac-
cording to the Police Department,
this has been the second increase
ever instituted.

$10 dollar parking increase not related to new car or emergency system

Furthermore, Davidson allows
students to pay per semester
whereas other schools make stu-

dents pay for the full year, even if -

they go on leave for a semester.

Ray Thrower, Director of Pub-
lic Safety and Police, states that
“(Due to the increase], I feel like
we’re starting to get in line with
other schools.” He adds that stu-
dent concern caused the Police
Department to lower the cost of
changing a vehicle. If one decides
to bring a different car to school
sometime during the year, he/she
will be charged an extra three dol-
lars instead of five.

The Police Department modi-
fied their own transportation this
year. This summer the department
was granted a used Taurus by the
Davidson College motorpool. The
Taurus replaced a Suzuki Samurai
which the department previously
had.

“We purchased the Samurai
as a temporary vehicle that we
would use for one year. That was
four or five years ago, and getting
a new car kept getting put off and
put off until it [the Samurai] was
worn out,” Sergeant Dave Harding
says.

In addition to the Taurus, the
department still has use of a 4-door
Sidekick, but that car has been
repainted white to match the new
addition.

Harding says that the new car

had nothing to do with an increase
in crime or any criminal concerns
on the part of the department.
“The Taurus was what the
motor pool had, and we needed a
new vehicle,” he says. “And the
car works fine. It is still small
enough to get around campus, but
we don’t worry about it breaking
down, and it gets us where we need
to go, whether it’s a'call on cam-
pus, in town, or the Intake Center

[the

(the county jail).”

And as police officers jour-
neyed to vehicle improvements,
they instituted a new system in
which emergency calls travel to
Charlotte rather that Davidson.
Thrower states, “We're riding on
Charlotte Police
Department’s] technology; all
we’re having to pay foris our equip-
ment with a small maintenance
fee. We feel very fortunate that

they asked us to come on.”

The change interrupted a 20-
year association between the
Davisdon college and community
police departments. Until now,
when students dialed 2-911, the
call reached dispatchers in
Davidson who then transferred the
calls to the college.

With the new system, students
must dial 9-911 to request emer-
gency assistance. The call then
filters through dispatchersin Char-
lotte who will be able to provide
better assistance than before.

Thrower complains that dis-
patchers in Davidson were inexpe-
rienced and often rude to students.
Of the new system he says, “‘As far
as professionalism and technology
are concerned, the [Charlotte-
Mecklenburg] system is one of the
top agencies in the country. It is
not unusual for them to have 20 to
25 people at the same time in the
office.”

The College will not have to
pay much more for the updated
service. Charlotte is even financ-
ing a new repeater to be placed at
the north end of the county to im-
prove communication capabilities.

The last system was not only
cost-inefficient but police officers
could not tell where students were
located if they were not calling
from a call box. The new dis-
patcher service will also alleviate
costs to the town of Davidson.

New Writing Center opens doors to all students

By KirstEN RECKNAGEL
Staff Writer

Sunday, September 10,
Davidson’s Writing Center will
open its doors for the first time.
Designed to provide writing assis-
tance during any stage of the writ-
ing process, the center affords stu-
dents a unique opportunity to con-
sult trained writing tutors.

Creation of the Writing Cen-

ter was pioneered by Assistant Pro-
fessor of English Shireen Carroll.
Carroll explains that, since she
came to Davidson three years ago,
she has “worked with faculty across
the curriculum” in terms of writing
and composition. Her extensive
surveys of both faculty and stu-
dents highlighted several concerns
pertaining to student writing abil-
ity.

Professors agree, Carroll

states, that “effective writing is a
crucial skill for liberal arts college
graduates.” However, professors
_ are often unable to devote time to
teach writing skills in addition to
their own coursework and research.
Students also indicated their desire
for more avenues of support in
composition.
In response to these discover-
ies, the English Department spon-
sored a proposal, drafted by Carroll,

for the creation of a formal system
to help students with their writing.
The plan gained faculty approval
in May 1995 and this fall, the Writ-
ing Center, located in Chambers
Building’s north basement Room
B-6, will open with a staff of four
supervised, trained tutors.

The tutors will be students who.

are currently enrolled in one of
Carroll’s upper level English
classes and will have been trained

by her to provide effective assis-
tance to their peers in such areas as
compositional organization, gram-
mar, and clarity. Carroll stresses
that help will be available “at any
stage of the writing process, from
prewriting through revision.”

However, tutors will not serve
as editors or proofreaders. In addi-
tion to peer assistance, the center
will offer computer instruction in
areas such as grammar and writing
mechanics.

Professors of students seek-

_ ing assistance will be notified of

aid sessions and specific issues
addressed by Writing Center tu-
tors. Professors will communicate
with the center as well, designat-
ing any areas or issues they prefer
tutors not address. In addition, fac-
ulty may refer students to the Writ-
ing Center for instruction. This
open communication between stu-
dents, professors, and Writing Cen-
ter staff will serve to clarify, for all
involved parties, any questions that
may arise with respect to the Honor
System.

To take advantage of the
wealth of instruction and informa-
tion that may be found in the Writ-
ing Center, students need only to
drop in. A list of the Writing
Center’s official hours will be cir-
culated soon.
