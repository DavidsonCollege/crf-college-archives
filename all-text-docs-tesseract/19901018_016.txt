Unless you really enjoy reading manuals,
get a Macintosh.

Tim Moses
Computer Science
Vanderbilt University

“Macintosh practically eliminates the need to
keep manuals next to my computer, because—
regardless of which program I'm using—I can
open, close, save, and print files in exactly
the same way. And you cant say that about
any other computer.

“Today lots of other computers are”
attempting to look and work like a
Macintosh, but it’s just not possible.
They'e too fundamentally different
to. begin with. This may sound.

a little strange, but comparing

a Macintosh to other com-
puters is like comparing apples to
Oranges. You can squash the orange
into shape and paint it to look like an apple,

but underneath the makeup, it’s still
an orange.

‘It’s funny—I work at the Vanderbilt:
computer store and I've seen lots of eee
switch from other computers to Macintosh, _
but I've never seen anybody with a

Macintosh switch to another computer.”
