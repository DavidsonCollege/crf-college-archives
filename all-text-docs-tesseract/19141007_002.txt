D.AVIDSON’S INITIAL VICTORY

Even Davidson's opponents last Sat-
urday were torced to concede that the
tie game with Clemson was virutally
victory tor the Red and Black Machine
on account of the tremendous odds
against it, and the undeniable superiority
which it showed in the lase half. All che
more will) Davidson men everywhere
clain it a victory, and will rejoice in the
splendid opening of the 114 season.
Davidson is proud ot its team and. its
coaches, and ot the irresistable fighting | °
spirit. which has awakened trom its
seven-year slumber, never to sleep again.
March on!

SATURDAYS CHLERING.

The rooting at the Saturday. game
was the best organized and those effective
for -vears. “The student body was lined
up on one entire side of the field. and
there. were five cheer-leaders. Did vou
try crossing tothe other side, and listen-
ing to it fron: there? . dy was cthunder-
ous, and to this mighty cheering whe
Clemson was sweeping toward our yoat

in tite first quatter, “Hoid ‘em David
son!” is duc. in large part. the stone
wall defence which Davidson put up

under the shadow of her goal posts, the
only time she was in danger.

FOOT BALL AND LIFE.

—— f;

A clean foot ball game is a pictire of
the game ot life, as it ovghr to. be.
very man is plaving not for bis owe
‘interest. but tor the glory of a common
cause, Every ove has a part and a hi iz
part. Tt aman is nor runing with rhe
ball. or leading the attack, He is running
interference for those that do. Courage
and grit and self-control are prime fre-
tors,

Lf men would put into their battle. of
lite the fire and fight that the foot bal!
warrior puts into a gridiron gatne, there
would be some mighty victories scared
instead of crushing defeats.

DR. W. R. DOBYNS COMING.

Dr. W. R. Dobyns, of St. Joseph. |
Mo,.. will reach Davidson October 14
to canduct the regular Fall Campaign.
Dr. Dobvns is a wonderful speaker, ap-,
pealing in a unique way to college men.
Many. would rank him ahove Robt. F.i
Speer in the wonderful power of his per-
sonality. Ut is said thar audiences. after
being held with strange power by his
words, will leave the hall in silence, and
walk for some distance through — the

streets before a word is.spoken,

Davidson is indeed fortunate to hate
such a man for six davs, October 14th
through the 20th.

As.a striking evidence of the food at
tendance and interest shown in Y. ML.
C. A. work this vear, the regular Thirs |
day night services are being held and

“all continue to beheld in Shearer Hall.
feos a glad day when the Davidson
VY. AE CLA. outgrew the cramped, 4
adeauate quarters occunied heretofore.

Fvervone is palling for a new Y. ML.
C. A., so great is the need.
