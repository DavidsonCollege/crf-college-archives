Memphis - Georgetown Square Off For National Championship

By ANDY BARRON

The NCAA basketball tournament
has proved at least one thing; the Big East
is college basketball’s best conference.
Big East teams dominated all comers
over the weekend to place Georgetown,
St. John’s and Villanova in the illustrious
NCAA final four. Never before has one
conference placed three teams in this exc-
lusive group.

For those of you who don’t believe
the Big East is the best, a comparison of
the top conferences is in order. Though
the SEC surprised a lot of people (includ-
ing me) during tournament play, the cin-
derella runs of Auburn, Alabama and
Kentucky do not a strong conference
make. The Big Ten flopped in NCAA
post-season play, compiling a yawn-cre-
ating 4-6 record, and ending its claim as
the nation’s top roundball conference.

In fact, the Big East has but one com-
petitor; the ACC. At the start of tourna-
ment play, ACC fans were riled by the
NCAA’s tournament committee giving
both the Big East and the Big Ten more
bids than the ACC (six as opposed to
five). This complaint was well-founded
in the case of the Big Ten. Not so for the
Big East. In head-to-head meetings be-

tween the two conferences, the Big East
won five out of six meetings (Georgia
Tech beat Syracuse to prevent a Big East
sweep). Every ACC team was eliminated
by a Big East team. Not once did a Big
East team lose a game in which they were
favored to win. However Duke, Mary-
land and North Carolina were all upset;
these ACC schools clamped on the
choke-collar against Boston College (for
Duke), and Villanova (for both Maryland
and North Carolina). After last weekend,
Big East fans were reciting the following
to any unfortunate ACC supporter they
saw: “What does the Big East eat for
lunch?” Answer: “The ACC.”

ACC fans did have one thing to
chuckle about last week: my predictions.
I was wrong on all four ACC teams.
Maryland not only failed to win the
Southeast region, they failed to win a
game. UNC beat Auburn and N.C. State
beat Alabama to prove Alabama should
stick to auto racing. Yes, even Georgia
Tech won a game I said they would lose.
In fact, Georgia Tech just missed upset-
ting mighty Georgetown and going on to
the final four. I have a feeling the boys
from Atlanta will be in the thick of things
next year.

As for the rest of my predictions, I’m
sure no one noticed I was perfect in the
mid-west regional. In addition, I picked
three out of the final four teams. Keeping
this back-patting in mind, I now give my
predictions concerning the last two
rounds.

Georgetown-St. John’s is easy.
Though CBS is tickled pink by having the
Hoyas and Redmen meet for a fourth
time, I’m sure St. John’s coach Lou Car-
nesecca isn’t. Every NCAA champion
has one close call before winning it all.
Georgetown got their close call out of the
way against Georgia Tech. Though St.
John’s did beat Georgetown earlier this
year, Patrick Ewing and company sought
and got revenge with a capital “R”,
twice. St. John’s looked sluggish at best
against N. C. State and was lucky to win.
I think the game will be close most of the
way. However, when the game is over,
Georgetown will win by ten. The biggest
question in my mind is whether or not
Georgetown coach John Thompson will
have another copy of Carnesseca’s lucky
sweater.

Memphis State-Villanova is much
more difficult for me. I think Memphis
State has a lot more talent. But Memphis

State reached the final four despite their
strigent efforts to the contrary. While
Memphis State tried to lose every game
they played, Villanova’s “never-say-die”
attitude overcame poor first halves
against both Maryland and UNC. In other
words, I want to pick Villanova.

What keeps me from doing so is the
past. A cinderella tear gets to the final
four every year, or so it seems. Last year
it was Virginia, N. C. State the year be-
fore, etc. N. C. State managed to win it
all; but that was an exception, not the
rule. The last underdog from Philadel-
phia to make the final four was Pennsyl-
vania in 1979. Pennsylvania lost to eve-
ntual champ Michigan State 101-67!
Memphis State will stumble by Villanova
to gain the dubious honor of facing Geo-
rgetown.

The championship game will feature
All-Americans Patrick Ewing of Geo-

tgetown and Keith Lee of Memphis

State. Unfortunately for Lee, Ewing’s
supporting cast possesses far more talent,
depth, and experience. Ewing won’t
dominate Lee, but Georgetown shouldn’t
have too much trouble with Memphis
State. Final Score: Georgetown 69,
Memphis State 53.

Davidson scored big wins over
High Point and Virginia Tech
early in the week. The end of the
week saw Davidson get nipped by
N.C. State and beaten by Wake
Forest.

Davidson’s week got off to a
great start against High Point. The
Wildcats won 9-1, a score that
obscured the talent on High
Point’s strong squad.

“T think the clay hurt them
{High Point],” said Coach Jeff
Frank. “They had some talented
kids; we just played very well that
day.” .

Davidson’s busy schedule had
the Cats playing Virginia Tech the
next day. A different team, but the
results were the same as the day
before. Davidson beat Virginia

made the team work harder. We
really got some great perfor-
mances from Trip Caldwell
(sophomore) and Michael Meyer
(sophomore).”

The next two matches in-
volved ACC foes. The first one
against N.C. State resulted in a
disappointing 5-4 loss for David-
son. However, Davidson won two
of the three doubles matches as
senior Sedge Gray and Dallas won
number one doubles 7-6, 6-4, and
senior John Hackett and Caldwell
took number two doubles 6-4, 6-
4. In singles play freshman Jim
Thompson won number three 6-2,
7-5, and Hodge won number six
4-6, 6-3, 6-3.

“The fast courts really helped
me,” said Hodge. “I’m still get-
ting used to playing on clay and
the courts at N.C. State helped me
get out of a slump. | think my play

“They were a very experienced
team and it showed. I thought we
might have been able to win two
of the singles matches we lost.
Stull, our doubles play was great
and I was pleased with our perfor-
mance.”

The Wake Forest match was
Davidson's only big loss of the
week. The Demon Deacons won
8-1, undoubtedly aided by their
fast courts. The one win for
Davidson was Thompson's 1-6,
6-3, 7-6 win in number three sing-
les.

“Jim Thompson has played
extremely well this year,” said
Frank. “He has won some clutch
matches over some big oppo-
nents. We are very pleased with
his progress.”

Davidson's schedule con-
tinues to be densely packed,
though the caliber of competition
begins to relax in the weeks
ahead.
