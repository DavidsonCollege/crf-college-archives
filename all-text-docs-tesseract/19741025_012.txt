some of the mottos that our
club team takes to their hearts
as they courageously and
dauntlessly adorn the college
gridiron with missed tackles,
broken plays, clips, face
maskings, late-hits, and foul
language, which hopefully
(God forbid) won’t bring us

On the more serious side,

Davidson’s soccer team:did
not have one of its better
showings last Friday, losing to
the Citadel 1-0.

Davidson looked ragged
throughout the game, as
neither the offense nor defense
played very well. Late in the
first half, the Citadel got a
score on a breakaway.

That was all the scoring for
the game. In the second half,
the Cats mounted some good
offensive attacks, but never
seemed to get off a good shot.

The Citadel also put on some
good pressure, but. goalie
Charlie ‘Slaglé made good
saves.

The Cats definitely missed
the person of Tom Blackwood,
who was still ragged by an in-

record on the line, will meet
the club team from U. N.C. on
the practice football field at 10
a.m. on Saturday. This game
definitely reflects some
histcrical meaning, in that it
was two years ago on
Homecoming; at 10 in the mor-
ning, on Saturday, and on the
practice field, that the Cats
(0-5) met U.N. foi then 5-0. The
outcome was 2-0 in favor of the
Cats and an impressive win.

Credit for the win goes to Eric
Scharling, who after three
quarters of a fine no-hitter by
Carl Rizzo, blocked an at-
tempted U. N.C. punt that
meandered out of the Tarheel
end zone for the game’s only
score. Star watchers have
predicted yet another upset
win this weekend, as our
spiritual leader KRSNA says,
“The stars are right and the
Gods are pleased.”

For those of you who are
“stats ” nuts, we have none to
offer, and for those who are
Monday mornin quar-
terbacks, we have
that really detracts from the
purpose of this fine article..

«What we want to do here, is

show some insight into this
wonderful, masochistic game.
You know-—“‘local color.’’

In our first game of the
season, our hearty team
travelled to Duke University,
where we were up-ended by
some key tactical mistakes
(showing up in the first place)
that resulted in a drubbing of
our heralded crew and the
misfortune of this season
beginning as all others. have.

The most outstanding play for
'the Cats-in this

game was
a team effort that resulted in
the blocking of an extra point
attempt, causing the miscued
score (27-0) and resulting in a
great moral victory for the
Cats. From here, it proved
that all the club team could
successfully and consistently
do every weekend, was bend
the point spread.

On the nest weekend, David-
son was pitted against
Western Piedmont Com-
munity College, a two-year
lumber jacking school from
Asheville. Their visit resulted
in yet another axing of the
Cats’ for stardom, a bowl
bid, and Howard Cosell. Once
again, Davidson was guilty of
making some key tactical
errors, and before you can say

“paiistiutt munnaatt’” (Fin-

nish for fried eggs), the score

jury™ received in the Ap-
palachian game.
On Tuesday, the Cats

travelled to Raleigh to play
North Carolina State. David-
son scored first, as Joe Dun-
‘can connected on a 25 yard
shot thirty minutes into their:
st half. Davidson managed to
hold off State until about ten
minutes before the end of the
half. Then State scored on a
center from the left wing. The
half ended with the score tied
1-1.

In the second half, all the
scoring belonged to N.C.
State. Five minutes into the
second half, they scored on a
play similar to their first half
goal. Midway through the
half, State’s left wing made a
beautifrr maneuver to beat

r

enty. But:

was 21-0 and the final gun had
sounded.

On that festive occasion two
weeks ago, the Cats produced
a club record (ready stats
nuts) of two outstanding
plays. We will deal with these

in order or occurrence. First , -

with’ five mmutes and 32
seconds left in the third quar-
ter, Jim Clark, playing in his
old high school position (rear
end), while pursuing on a
sweep play, managed to wipe
out Western Piedmont’s entire
cheerleading section. He
knows the difference between
a collision sport and a contact
sport. More power to ya, Jim.

Secondly, with 42 minutes of
the game yet to play, David-
son’s vaunted offense got it
together on a three yard down
and out. pass completion to
Gogo-—the Spanish Fly. We are
all very proud of Gogo, and
with every game, it appears
that he develops into more and
more of a deep threat. More
power to ya, Gogo.

The third week of contention
(?) brought an event to the
Davidson’ gridiron only
rivaled in history by Custer’s
last stand. On
crossed Sunday, the Central
Piedmont Community College
Outlaws (droogies: wor-
shippers of ultra-violence)
walked onto the playing field
and out fought us tooth and
nail in a closer game than the
39-0 score indicates.

However, it must be noted
here for the records and all
those stats nuts, that the game
was called by the Davidson
bench after it was decided that
the game was having \too
many sobering effects on the
team. In this game, there was

-only one outstanding play, the

calling of the game, which can
be argued out on moral
grounds anytime and any day
in room 211 Duke.

This game did, however,

produce more serious results.
Scott Prince, our outstanding
right offensive guard, broke
his left wrist while retrieving
his left hand from the face
mask of an opposing defender,
and Lester Abberger was lost
for the season with ligament
problems in his knees. Lester
was the team’s leading pass
receiver and his talents will be
sorely missed.

All this leads to the season’s
most remarkable quote by an
opposing team (you’re on,

the fullback and scored from
in close. That ended the
scoring, with State taking a 3-1
victory.

Playing a good game for the
Cats were Duncan and Billy
Hawke. Blackwood didn’t
even make the trip as his leg
was still bothering him.

The Cats could be.-in serious
trouble if Blackwood doesn’t
return soon, as his ball control
is sorely missed.

The Cats tried to com-
pensate for Blackwood’s loss

by changing their set-up from ‘

a 4-3-3 to a 2-4-4, hoping to con-

trol play in the middle of the |

field.

Davidson will be out to
break this losing streak on
Saturday when they host Fur-
man at 10 a.m.
