ever, the new leaders stated that their vision goes
further than that. They intend to encourage debate
between the parties as well as within their own
organization. As Kozicharow noted, the college

decide what one believes.

eval Eu-

ment on Alan’s part to allow those voices he
created to be expressed by other people. For him,
it’s a chance to see his characters come off of the
page, but it’s also a risk because they will be
expressed by people other than himself.”

Parker is confident that the Katherine and
Tom Belk Visual Arts Center will make an excel-
lent venue for the production, though it has never
been previously used for theatrical performances.
“It’s a dramatic space,” Parker said. “It has balco-
nies, a big atrium with an upstairs and downstairs,

“and strange places for entrances and exits.”

In addition to the Davidson publication party,
Parker will travel to New York for another cel-
ebration of the book on September 24 at New York
University. In addition, he will teach at NYU for

Though he will attend some of the rehearsals,
Parker has pledged Lambert full artistic license
for the production. Lambert noted, “I don’t think
