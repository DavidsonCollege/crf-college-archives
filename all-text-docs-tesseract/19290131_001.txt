Second Summer School
Will Continue On Same
Plan As That Of First

Varied Offerings in Curricula are
Announced for Session

BULLETIN ISSUED

Five Classes of Students Inter-
ested in Course

Davidson College’s Second Summer
School which begins the 10th of June
and runs through the 19th of July, will
offer a number of varied courses for those
wishing to attend. The Summer School
at Davidson is still in its infancy as the
first summer sesson was held last year;
but the quality is beyond reproof. All
college credits are accepted by this col-
lege and the professional credits are ac-
cepted by the State Department of Pub-
lic Instruction.

The College has gotten out a bulletin en
the Summer School in which is stated
the groups to which the Summer School
should appeal. The groups areas fol-
lows:

1. High school graduates who intend
to enter college next fall, and have en-
trance conditions to remove.

2. College students who are deficient
in their work, and who wish to remove
this deficiency.

3. College students who wish to ad-
vance their college standing by summer
work. ae

4. Teachers who wish to raise the
grade of license held.

5. Teachers who are not college grad-
and who wish to continue work
toward a degree.

Each day an assembly is held during the
session which is vital to the Summer
School. It consists of devotional exer-
cises and instructive talks. The daily an-
nouncements made at the assembly are
mportant: because any changes announ-
ced at that time may affect the work
throughout the school. The attendance
at these assemblies is required,

The dormitories of the college are avyail-
able for the use of the students of the
summer session. Those attending may
board at the hotel or at some private
boarding house. The board will be from
$5.00 to $6.00 a week, and the boarding
houses are convenient for the students
to both dormitories and classes.

The Davidson College Library, con-
taining more than 30,000 selected volumes
are at the use of the students.

The courses offered tentatively, with
the understanding that additional coursese
will be given if there is sufficient demand
for them.

Bible—Old Testament History or Old
Testament Ideals—6 hours,
FEducation—Educational

vision—3 hours.
