The responsibilities of all and the power of one |

B y this time, you have all heard
about the death of 20-year-old
Benjamin Wynne at Louisiana State
University in late August. Ben-
jamin was found on the floor of his
fraternity house in the early morn-
ing hours of Tuesday, August 26,
1997, along with about a dozen
other stu-
dents who
were
passed
out from
excessive
drinking.
Four other students were hospital-
ized, and Benjamin was pronounced
dead as a result of acute alcohol
poisoning. His blood alcohol level
was reported to be .588, almost six
times what is considered legally
drunk.

Benjamin Wynne was a sopho-
more returning to Louisiana State
and had just accepted a bid to join

Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The
drinking that occurred on the night
of August 25 was said to have been
incelebration of “Bid Night,” LSU’s
version of our own traditions such
as First Night Down and Self-Se-
lection Night. It was intended to be
an introduction to fraternity life and
a celebration of be-
coming affiliated.
However, as a re-
sult of out-of-con-
trol drinking, this
exciting night that
Benjamin should
have never forgotten became one
that he will never have the opportu-
nity to remember.

At its heart, this issue isn’t at
all about SAE, or even Greeks in
general; it’s about college students
and the culture in which we all live
that supports alcohol abuse and en-
courages students to drink in ex-
cess. It’s also an issue of responsi-

Miscellaneous musings

QO" my mind:

* It’s nice to see that the college
has finally made a strong statement
condemning the use of drugs on
campus. An extra twenty pages of
coverage in the Red Book all but
confirms the fact that drugs indeed
are really bad. When it all comes
down toit,I con-
sider myself a
man of policy,
and I am posi-

ward spiral. I leave the choice up to
you. Make a difference. Apathy
kills.
¢ Leaving my bitterness be-
hind, I turn to a heartwarming story
regarding the Carolina Panthers.
The team itself can’t score a touch-
down, but the organization is de-
serving of recognition. Last Sun-
day I partici-
pated in a car
wash at the

tive that from
this point on, no
Davidson Col-
lege student will ever smoke pot
again. Let’s celebrate our newfound
purity by burning all the incense
that until now has been stored in our
desk drawers.

¢L also want to complain about
PDA (public displays: of affection)
in Chambers. I can’t begin to tell
you how many times last year that I
saw a young couple embrace or kiss

Wendy’s in
Huntersville.
For five or six
; hours I, along
with thirty other fraternity brothers
and two girls dressed like Wendy,
jumped around nearby streets ac-
costing and amusing motorists, hop-
ing that they could take five min-
utes out of their day to have their
vehicles washed and in the process
contribute to a worthy cause. All
the money earned at the event went
to an employee named Randall who

before is trying
they went to raise
to class. funds for
Alltcan Drugs, PDA, and the nice- a _iife-
say to that a _ saving
is “Geta OQUY bad-player Panthers. multiple
life!” organ
Now that trans-

I think about it, | am not even sure
if I can tolerate hand-holding as a
viable option. Tell me, honestly, is
there anything romantic about go-
ing toclass? Furthermore, the cham-
bermaids of chastity do not approve
of sexual activity under their roof.
If steps are not taken to curb this
ridiculousness, the only justifiable
and foreseeable action I can think of
would be a ten page “petting”’ sec-
tion in next year’s Red Book. Is this
what you want? I suggest that you
frown upon all your friends that do
that french kiss thing in Chambers.
“If not, you can expect life here at
Davidson to continue on its down-

plant. ; .

The highlight of the day for
everyone came when Sir Purr, the
mascot of the Carolina Panthers,
appeared. He stayed about two
hours, harassing cars in the drive-
thru and helping us wash cars. Sir

’ Purr even found time to antagonize

ahurried Richard Terry as he waited
in line for his Kiddie Frosty. Ap-
parently, Mr. Terry doesn’t enjoy
being cuddled by a large, furry ani-
mal. Nevertheless, Sir Purr was a
giant success and a welcome pres-
ence in a world filled with so much
pessimism. Kudos go to the Pan-

thers!

‘took my title.

bility, both individual and collec-
tive. Was this 20-year-old LSU
sophomore responsible for how
much he drank thatnight? Yes. Are
the individuals who provided the
alcohol to Benjamin responsible for
his death? You bet. Were his
fraternity brothers and those with
him that night responsible for look-
ing out for him? You better believe
it.

Would things have been differ-
ent that night at LSU if someone
had told Benjamin that he was drink-
ing too much? Would Benjamin be
alive today if another student would
have offered to walk him home be-
fore he had the chance to drink
enough alcohol to stop his’ heart?
There are no answers to these ques-
tions, but it is certainly frustrating
to think that perhaps one individual
saying the words, “I think you’ ve
had too much tonight, let’s go home”
might have saved a young man’s

life.

Each student at Davidson car-
ries some amount of responsibility
for the campus culture and the stan-
dards of what is and what is not
acceptable behavior for Davidson
students. We’re all in this together.
We all need to watch out for one
another and prevent a situation such
as this from happening on our cam-
pus. Just because it hasn’t hap-
pened here at Davidson College
doesn’t mean that it can’t. Now is
the time to educate yourself, your
hallmates, your fellow fraternity or
eating house members, your team-
mates, and your fellow students
about just how dangerous exces-
sive drinking can be and just how
quickly a night of celebration can
go irreversibly wrong.

As First Night Down ap-
proaches, keep in mind the respon-
sibility that each of us has for our-
selves and those around us. Al-

though First Night Down and Self-
Selection Night certainly receive
the most hype of events down on
the Court, responsibility and cau-
tion néed to extend beyond these
events. Incidents including alcohol
poisoning, sexual assault, and vio-
lent behavior can just as well take
place on Second Night Down or at
any time during the semester. In
fact, they are perhaps more likely to
occur at these times since we are all
less watchful.
The beginning of a new school
year is afun and exciting time for all
students, whether new or returning.
Have a great time. Celebrate with
friends. Make memories. Most of
all, please-be safe and responsible.
Remember that it might only take a
few concerned words from one in-
dividual to make an immeasurable
difference in someone’s life.

Hobbie does his own research

ast week, one article (other
L than my own) demanded my
attention above others. For
those of you that did not read,
“Strange man wanders campus, ver-
bally accosts student in Union,” it
chronicled the adventures of a “5-
foot-8 Caucasian male in his late
20s with curly brown hair” in and
around the Davidson community a
few weeks ago.
He did anumber of weird things
like call

cinated me, so I went to the town
library to investigate.

Although scared of what might
happen, I approached the librarian’s
desk and asked her, “Are you the
one he called the anti-Christ?”
When she said yes, I asked, “Well,
are you the anti-Christ?” She an-
swered, “No... I don’t think so.”

Mmmh. After this cryptic,
somewhat mysterious answer, I
searched the library’s holdings for

more evidence that

the town might point to the town
librarian - library as the beginning
“the anti- of the end of the world.
Christ,” Both books about the
undress a anti-Christ in the card

female junior with his eyes, and tell
a student in the Union Cafe that “he
was going to take him out to the
football field and ‘kick his a—.’”

The article disturbed me for a
number of reasons. Mainly be-
cause the comfortable, safe, warm-
fuzzy feeling of the Union had been
violated by some “freak.” Also, I
was upset that this fellow took the
title for which I have been vying for
more than three years now: campus
freak. That jerk!

This man and his experiences
caused me to think a lot about freaks
this week — and not just because he
What is a freak,
really?

Someone different? Different
from the norm? [recalled that many
people who were seen as different,
threatening, and crazy in their time
ended up changing the world for-
ever. For good or worse, their freak-
ish ways became the norm. The
most obvious example for me is
Jesus of Nazareth, a fellow that was
pretty wacked out, yet managed to
become the inspiration for a world-
wide religion. :

Was this man, our “campus
freak,” that far out? He mentally
undressed a female junior (heck,
I’m often guilty of that) and told a
student that he was going to “kick
his a—.” For all we know, that
student may have really needed a
good a— kicking. Don’t we all
need one sometimes? OK, don’t I
need one sometimes? —

Finally, he called the town li-
brarian “the anti-Christ.” This fas-

catalogue belonged to another li-
brary, but I did find a great book on
ceramics under the call number of
the beast, 666. Notes on “firing
clay bodies” graced the back.
Sounds like hell fire to me!

Before I left, I also applied
some numerology — i.e. calculus
— to the “campus freak’s” name,
Dwayne. If you assign a corfe-
sponding number to each letter of
the 26 letters of the alphabet, and
apply them to the name you get the
set: four, 23, one, 25, 14, and five.

By adding these together, you

get 72. Then if you divide by the -

number of letters in the name, six,
you get 12. By dividing this by two
and then multiplying that answer by
111, you get 666! Creepy!

Even after this important dis-
covery, I left the library somewhat
more confused than before. Luck-
ily, the librarian gave me a great
lead in my search. She said that this
strange man had repeatedly used
the library’s computers to write re-
ligious texts. So off I went to the
Internet!

‘On Yahoo, our trusty
websearcher, there are only nine-
teen site matches for “‘anti-Christ.”
Although none contain information

~“ on the mysterious “Dwayne” and

halfofthem are for Marilyn Manson,
the ones left over are some real
doozies.

There is a site that claims that
The Koran is the testimony of the
anti-Christ. This same site claims
that people should be more open
minded. Yeah, man. The “Top ten

list of possible anti-Christs” ranges
from Mickey Mouse downto No. 1,
Kathie Lee Gifford. The ‘David
Hasselhoff is the anti-Christ” site is
a must-read, but the most amazing
of the websites is
www.Antichrist.com.

The site, created on June 6,
1996, holds pages and pages of text
about how the author, a resident of
Las Vegas, is the resurrection of
John Lennon and the anti-Christ.

* He, John Lennon/anti-Christ,
signed the introduction to his pages
of Bible verses and Beatles lyrics,
“Yours truly, David, the anti-Christ.
P.S. Sorry I’m late.”

According to him, he is one of
the 24 elders in the Bible’s Book of
Revelation.

“These are the end times,” he
states, “and we have risen.”

Pretty scary, but before you tell
granny to get her gun you have to
remember a couple of things. First,
David, the anti-Christ was only rated
number four out of 10 for possible
anti-Christs. : .

You have Kathie Lee, Bill
Gates, and Dennis Rodman (and
maybe the librarian) to worry about
before him. Second, unless you’re
really enjoying life in a beautiful
and plush private college, the end of
the world is a good thing. Uh-oh.

As the millennium approaches,
websites and freaks announcing the
anti-Christ and the end of the world
will only increase.

“‘Heaven’s Gate” was only the
beginning.

We must band together to keep
our sanity at Davidson, to encour-
age each other to be insane once in
a while, and guard against freaks on
campus that might expand our
minds. Students, we must unite!

In the meantime, join some
other “campus freaks” like myself
at the Union this week where Katie
Kostner will speak on date rapé, the
film Cool Hand Luke willbe shown,
a hypnotist will, well, hypnotize
you, and coffee and doughnuts will
keep you going at Coffeehouse and
Jumpin’ Java. :

Check-your Union Calendar for
times and places. And I'll see you
at the Union — at least until the

apocalypse.
