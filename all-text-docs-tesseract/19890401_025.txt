games. Another difference was
the Wildkittens, the equivalent of
a junior varsity. Almost every
sport had a Wildkitten team.

One issue Davidsonians were
concerned with in the fifties was
highway deaths; several students
were killed in automobile
accidents. Davidson administra-
tion began its habit of telling
students that dorms would be
completed in a week when
reality proved to be at least two
months.

senselessness of war. Students attended a
program featuring folk songs and
speeches by professors such as Max
Polley.

Things had begun to change in other
ways as well by the late 1960’s. The
Spencer Commission report of 1969
recommended a move toward coeduca-
tion. The administration proposed an
exchange program with several girls’
schools.

Another part of the Spencer Commis-
sion report evaluated Davidson’s athletic
policies and debated the possibilities of
adding or eliminating scholarships.

In many ways, the day to day life of
the average Davidson student has
changed very little in 20 years.

The typical student used to have
difficulty finding a parking space back
then. The phone system elicited com-
plaints. The cafeteria food wasn’t quite
up to par with Mom’s.

Students had to worry about dates for
Midwinters. They sat through disap-
pointing football games. Freshmen had
transportation problems (one hall bought
acar tomake their lives easier).

Students in the 60’s pulled all-nighters;
they fought with their roommates; they
played flickerball; they hung out with
their friends; they worried about grades
and careers and lives; they loved
Davidson.

returned to campus as a result of a zoning
ordinance. Sadly, Davidson experienced
the loss of four eating houses: ATO, ETC,
Emanon and Fannie & Mable’s. There
was, however, the founding of a new
nouse in 1985. What was described in the
anuary 25, 1985 issue of The Davidsonian

most shocking court stories involved

national fraternities. Kappa Sigma and Sigma Phi Epsilon were the
newsmakers in the 80’s. With the addition of Kappa Sig and the return
of Sig Ep, the college holds with 7 national fraternities, 6 of which are
oncampus. In the early 80’s relations between Kappa Alpha (KA) and
the Black Student Coalition (BSC) were strained due to the KA “Old
South” ritual, which involved the wearing of Confederate uniforms
and parading while so dressed. The conflict resulted in the KA’s
having their traditional weekend off campus thereafter.

In sports there is perhaps only one story which will have any par-
ticularly dramatic effect upon life at Davidson, and that is the Trus-
tees’ decision to move the football program out of Division I and into
Division III. This is something any avid reader of The Davidsonian
could have seen coming. In a May 1985 issue, an article by then senior
Dwane D. Wright entitled, “Four Years as a Football Player: No

Hoopla, No Respect” appeared. In the article, Wright complained

about the absence of “perks” from the
Davidson program. The lack of bags,
sweats and jackets as emblems of their
team membership was an issue by which
Wright was particularly offended. He
continues, in his article, to scold the lack
of “respect” of the college for its football
players, citing his high school as a place
where football players received their
proper due. Wright claimed in the article
that “one gets the feeling that Davidson
tolerates football but does not support it.”
In the 80’s Davidson—along with the

nation—was formally introduced to yuippiedom and all that it entails.
While politics were pretty consistent, our musical tastes at Davidson
have most certainly changed. The 900 Room has played host to all
sorts of bands from country rock to techno-pop. The early 80's,
however, were perhaps the musical highlight of the decade. In 1980,

. Davidson was privileged enough to host Marty Bear, whom his critics
called “the voice of the 80's.” From the looks of him, I. think Marty
was scheduled to do a guest spot or two on Knight Rider, and may
even have been up for a role in Grease II, as he truly seems the quintes-
sential “actor/singer.” Other groups included R.E.M. and the Bangles.

Davidson has changed significantly over the past decade, for better

past, found in the form of people,

places and ideals, lingers on. On the threshold of the 90’ s, Davidson
shows both a sense of history and an ever-present ability to change its
