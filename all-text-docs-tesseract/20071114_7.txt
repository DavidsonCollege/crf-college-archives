D- -purr online magazine lands on its feet

By JENNIFER GAMBRELL
Staff Writer

A recent addition to Davidson College’s
publications, the online magazine D-Purr
bridges. the literary gap between The
Davidsonian andLibertas. The brainchild of
Matt Hayes ’08, D-Purr was conceived in the
spring of 2007.

When Hayes shared his idea with class-
mate Erin Doyle ’08, the two eagerly com-
posed a proposal to the Student Activities
Committee to get the magazine officially
approved.

It took only take a few months for D-Purr
to reach its online status in early November
2007.

Readers may wonder how the name D-
Purr originated. The original name for the

magazine was “Descricted,” but, in the mid-
dle of the planning process, Doyle suggested
something a little more Davidson-centric.
The editors chose a “D” for Davidson and
then added the “Purr” in honor of our
beloved Wildcat.

With an amusing slogan -““What makes
you purr?” the editors knew they had fash-
ioned a winning concept.

Pronounced “deeper,” the name of the
publication reflects the goals of the editors -
to delve creatively into the heart of campus
issues.

Hayes, Doyle and Owen Bussey, the co-
editors- in- chief, want D-Purr to serve as an
outlet for student writers to share their cre-
ativity and passions.

The writers may choose their topics as
long as they remain considerate of their audi-

ence’s beliefs and opinions.

Currently, the magazine has six staff writ-
ers who rotate writing articles.

“We definitely encourage anyone and
everyone to submit articles,” Doyle said.

In order to keep readers interested in the
journal, D-Purr’s website receives daily
updates.

The page itself is a sight to behold. Bussey
serves as the page’s main designer, and
Hayes creates the site’s graphics and art-
work.

Type www.dpurr.com into the internet
search bar, and a webpage full of vibrant
action greets you. A running artwork
slideshow featuring the week’s articles
appears, and there are links to previously
published works.

Since the articles are self-assigned, there is
no telling what subject you might come
across.

For example, Natty Hutchinson ’09 wrote
about network TV pilots last Wednesday, and
David Dennis ‘08 reviewed Jay-Z’s top-sell-
ing albums.

Film reviews, cultural criticisms and opin-
ion pieces also make appearances.

If a writer meets the dreaded writers block,
the editors happily hold a brainstorming ses-
sion to help generate fresh ideas.

D-Purr has opened a venue student expres-
sion. It is a publication meant to reach out to
the masses.

Without a specific target audience, and
with ever-changing articles on a variety pf
topics, the reader is sure to find something of
interest.

D-Purr’s editors hope that the pervasive-
ness of our online culture will add to the pop-
ularity of their publication.

They encourage students to read their
peers’ writing.
