“Woodstock Two”

‘4 Damn Good Album’

By STEVE SUFLAS
Staff Writer

“Woodstock Two" is an al
bum with problems. First,
it will be immediately com-
pared to the first ‘‘Wood-

stock"’ album, which is
probably unfair. ‘‘Wood-
stock’? was not a motion

picture soundtrack; it was a
musical documentary, inde-
pendent of the film, master-
fully produced and edited;
in short, a unity. ‘Wood-
stock Two” is merely an ex-
tension of the first album.

If someone were to com-
bine the two, they would
have a fantastic: thing, but
“Woodstock Two" lacks the
unity and direction of the
first album.

The second problem that
the album has is that the
best material was taken for
the first album. For example,
side one of ‘‘Woodstock
Two” is entirely Jimi Hend-
rix. The three cuts with their
stoned raps in between are
excellent. However, they
cannot compare to his ‘'Star-

Spangled Banner/Purple

Haze,"’ since that piece con-
tains some of the ‘greatest
guitar work eyer laid down
anywhere.

The third problem of the
album Is that it is a bold-
faced rip-off. Cotillion is
capitalizing on the magic of
the event, the fine flick and
the excellent first album to
sell an overpriced inferior
product.

You then are very justified
in asking why you should

Pay your good money to try:

and bring back a dream that
was beaten to. death at the
Altamont Speedway.

I have only one response

and that is in spite of
these great obstaeles,
“Woodstock Two" is stll a

damn good album. The Hen-
drix cuts make his death
much more painful because
they make you realize his
stature as a musician.

The Airplane cuts are of
their usual quality, tremen-
dous. The Butterfield Blues
Band cut is better than their
bummer. cut on the first al-
bum. Joan Baez is nice.

Crosby. Stills, Nash and
Young steal the album with
“Guinnevere,”” ‘4 plus 20,”
and ‘“Marakesh Express.”
There are the missed cues
and flat notes from their
performance on the first al-
bum, leaving excellent vocal

performances and beautiful —

harmonies. They’ serve to
make you that much more
impatient for their new live

album which is due out any

day.
Melanie finishes up the
third side with two songs

that serve to {sum up the
whole occassion: ‘My Beau-
tiful People’ and ‘The
Birthday of the Sun" and she
leaves you with a smile.

The fourth side is probably
the best one on the record
because it comes closest to
having a purpose. It starts
out with two killer cuts from
Mountain and closes out with
“Woodstock Boogie” by Can-
ned Heat.

The side serves to show the
great ‘Battle of the Bands,”
with each band trying to

Thus, Canned Heat, who

Listen to “Woodstock

Our opposition to this pro

fraternities themselves, only
with the site that has been
selected. At a time wheti re-
creational facilities in David-

would be a mistake to do

summer recreation.

Walking into

The collection — includes

irises and daffodils and the
Wisteria Beauty—sort of a
laughing view of what a
lazy woman could content

herself with. In contrast,
Miss Grosch_ energetically
mixes free and interesting

shapes with bright or pure
colors.

Most of the large. can-
vasses give strong depth sen-
sations: others, especially

Crs.

One must respect Laura
Grosch for her abandon, in
choosing a proverbial sub-
ject and in her mode of ex-
ecuting it. With “red-rags
und pink flags,” yellow blots
und brightness, she gives us
a Gauguin type fresh look
at old obvious beauty.

The bug's eye view Miss
Grosch selects may insult
the overly subjective obser-
ver, but it is recommended
you ignore the inclination
and groove on the happy
bouncing stuff.

The exhibit will be on dis-
play in the galleries until the
annual student show in May,
which will feature not only
paintings and sculpture but
a student film showing ‘as

a danger to already poor,

To the Editor:

In, compliance with. the
tradition of ‘Letters to the
Editor’ I intend to snort
and paw the earth. I am no
weirdo, But let me not be so
crass as to limit myself to
a single item as others have
done, For I have “rejected
the rest of my former pseudo-
morality and resolved to tell
all’ (Mrozek,  Slawomir;
‘Charlie’; Grove Press,
1967.) Hence, forward com
rads into the lament!

Last week Shaw Smith once
again demonstrated that he
is too big for Davidson.-For
what towly student could re-
sist the personal persuasion
worked by the smiling. di-
rector of placement on the
aged and the very young.
But riding a board with no
veto power is dangerous,
Shaw. This-time you almost
fell off. Next time it may
take more than magic. —

year partially to ‘maintain’

to be vaguely Telated to the

person has prescribed exer
cise and a low-fat diet. Ano-
ther told me that a little
nitroglycerin wouldn't hurt.
But I am sure that, were I
