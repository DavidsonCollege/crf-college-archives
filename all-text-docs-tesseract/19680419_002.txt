CRAP--On Second Look

Underneath all the hoopla and head-
lines about drinking and open dorms
that accompanied the release of the
CRAP report draft last week is an-
other proposed change of far more
importance.

What the Committee on Rules and
Punishments is asking for is not just
a liberalization of two rules. More im-
portant, the committee wants a whole
new attitude on the part of the college
towards its students.

For too long the college has clung
to the old-fashioned notion that its
job is to replace the student’s parents,
dictating morality to him and cuffing
him when he steps outside of the nar-
row bounds prescribed.

It is time for the college to realize
that it has some responsibility in help-
ing its student find answers to the
social questions which naturally arise
at this stage of his life. Then it will be
the student's job to show that he can

make the decisions in a responsibly
mature manner.

If the.college passes over CRAP’s
recommendation, students will go on
doing what they have done in the past.
maintaining their ‘surface conformity
to the standards desired" and drinking
behind locked doors and pulled
shades.

It comes down to this: until the
college’s attitude is changed, the stu-
dents cannot count themselves reason-
ably mature. Until the college admits
that its students can conduet them-
selves properly even in situations in-
volving alcohol and women, they can-
not prove to the college that the men
it is educating are responsible.

What happens now is up to the
faculty and trustees. The student body
thinks it can accept the new respon-
sibility, and the CRAP Committee does
too. All we ask for is the chance to
prove it.

Justice, Charlotte Style

Folks in Charlotte are fond of call-
ing their town the ‘Queen City” or
“the city of action.”

After watching their judicial sys-
tem and news media at work this
week, however, we would suggest an-
other term.

Bush league, for instance.

Four Davidson students were ar-
rested, jailed briefly and hauled to
court for a typieal schoolboy prank:
going out beyond the spectator area
at a Charlotte airport to watch the
planes.

Who the students were and whether
or not they committed the offense is

Worth A Try

A critic we know took one look at
the recommendation of the Constitu-
tion Revision Committee that political
parties be created on campus and said:

“That is the worst idea that com-
mittee has come up with yet.”

We beg to differ. If we had political
parties, we wouldn't have to choose
among seven presidential candidates.
We probably wouldn’t be subjected to
the inevitable. “me-tooism” in plat-
forms. We would not have to wade
through runoffs. And, best of all, it
might make for a more vigorous stu-
dent government.

For any one of those reasons, at any
rate, it's worth a try.

The Long Ride Back

The saying goes, “When you
drink, don’t drive.” But when every-
body's been drinking and you have
to get back to campus, you don’t
have much choice.

There will be dozens of parties
this weekend, and drinking at all
of them. An estimated 300 gallons
of spirits will be consumed.

All of this imbibing will be off.

campus. it must be: drinking is not
yet permitted on campus.

All weekend long Davidson stu-
dents and their dates will be up the
road and on the road. Some sober,
some high, and some dead drunk.

Nobody walks to Hattie’s or to the
perties. The cab companies in

neither here nor there.
The fact is. one of the students was
convicted, and the judge who convict-

ed him was apparently thinking more —

of recent events at the cdilege than
the alleged offense itself.

“It seems to me." he told the stu-
dents, “that with all the picketing, the
hissing of the ROTC Department and
the hanging of the’ Communist flag.
you boys wouldn't have time to get
out on airport runways.”

When the students’ lawyer asked
permission to address the judge, he
replied: :

“Don’t address me as the jury.
Speak to me as the law—because I am
prejudiced.”

He wasn’t the only prejudiced one.
A Charlotte radio “personality” who
prides himself on his wit and home-
spun philosophy picked up the story
for his hourly program.

He retold the trial story, with relish,
concluding: “Sock it to ‘em, judge!”

The behavior of both the judge and
the radio announcer is unorthodox,
unethical and inexcusable. They chose
to judge the students on the basis of
what they knew about some Davidson

‘students.

It would be a little presumptuous
on our part to tell a judge and a news-
man that snap judgments have no
place in their professions. But then
obviously there are a lot of simple
things they haven’t learned yet.

Statesville and Kannapolis don’t
answer at 3 a.ni.

This may be the weekend that
somebody doesn’t make it back.

The CRAP Committee has sug-
gested that drinking be permitted
on campus. It is a wise proposal and
a realistic one.

t€ the faculty and trustees see
fit to go along with the committee
report, the danger of drunk driving
will be reduced.

At least some parties could be
held on campus if the report is
adopted.

Somebody’s life could be saved.
But in the meantime . . . Cheers!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Satires Score Previous Letters

To The Editor:

In my four years at David-
son College, I have never
been so shocked. disappoint
ed, and thoroughly disgusted
in anybody as *¥ was Mon-
day.

Unfortunately for me, I
had just finished my mid-
morning snack at the Col-
lege Union and was enroute
to my third hour ROTC class
when I saw the Confederate
flag hanging from a. window
in Watts dormitory.

Unashamedly I admit the
sight of the flag made me
sick to my stomach to the ex-
tent. that 1 spontaneously re-
gurgitated my delicious Slat-
er cinnamon roll and eleven-
cent coke.

You, the enlightened ones
of this liberal institution or
whoever hopes to reinstitute
disastrous regionalism should
go even further. The great
unity that we as Americans
are currently enjoying was
founded by the sound defeat
of regionalist factions over a
century ago. The war was a
costly one.

Men have fought and died
so that we -as Americans
now enjoy the greatest feel-
ing of unity and common in
terest of. any nation in mod.
ern history.

It is a shame that you
guys show off in front of men
who are at least attempting
to prepare themselves for
defense of us in case the un.

ity of this great nation is
once again violated.

‘If you value regionalism
more than this country's
principles, then leave. Please
leave. There is no room for
you in America. But more
important. you are not want-
ed.

With the past_weeks of sad

events and America’s at-
tempt at peace and the pres-
ervation of unity in Vietnam,
I find it hard to understand
that some of you have no
better way to spend your
time.

This school has left me
with many wonderful mem-
oriés. I'm proud of David.

Davidson College

To The Editor:

After reading and ponder-
ing the Challenge asserted
‘by Professor Workman, and’
duplicated by Professor Mc
Gavock. we, the undersign
ed, have arrived at 4 pro-
posal which seems to be a
logical extension of the one
offered by the aforemention-
ed faculty members.

We, the concerned students
of Davidson College, wish to
establish a fund which will
have as its purpose the ac-
ceptance of a black profes
sor on the faculty. We feel
that such a ‘faculty scholar
ship’ will add considerable
diversity to an otherwise
colorless faculty.

To stpport our contention.
each of us has agreed to con.
tribute $7.50 toward such a
fund, since this amount ap-
pears to be somewhat com
mensurate with the donations
of McGavock and Workman,

Thus, we challenge you.
the faculty members, to
bleed us white, therefore
demonstrating to us that—
YOU CAN!

Respectfully yours,

Cockrill Cites Activist Paradox

To The Editor:

Davidson College has long
been praised as one of the
nation’s leading academic
institutions. This apparent
strength has been credited
to many factors—curriculum,
excellent faculty, physical
plant and others.

Davidson’s greatest
strength, however, always
has been its student body.
At a time when Davidson is
going through so many
changes, the thoughtful stu-
dent should consider what
has made his predecessors
so outstanding.

The image of the David-
son student body has been
one of men striving for ac-
ademic excellence, men who
are proud of themselves and
proud of their college. In the
eyes of the public they were
clean-cut ‘‘gentlemen™ and

consequently they command.
ed the respect of peers and
elders alike.

Today's progressive stu-
dent body, however, has lost
this image of pride, and is
rapidly losing the respect of
the public. Unfortunately, the
public is receiving a greatly
distorted picture of David-
son.

The student body is still a
strong one, but the’ public
sees only a small, unrepre-
senative minority. This prob-
lem is not unique at David-
son, but is a general symp-
tom among American stu.
dents today.

The student body that the
public sees is one composed
of men who claim to be lib-
erated from the dogmas of
the past. They actively work
for the rights of the individ-

ual even if their methods de-
prive other persons.

They accuse those who do
not agree with them of being
bigoted. In order to secure
justice, they endanger the
liberty of others.

Their. methods are shame-
ful; they say they believe in
individual freedom yet they
refuse to recognize the free-
dom of an individual if his
views are not their own.

The cause is lack of pride
and respect for other people.
Lack of respect that results
in making a personal attack
on a member of the ROTC
Department, just because he
has pride in his country, in
his work, and in himself; a
man who is just as actively
working for his beliefs as {is
the Davidson activist. The
liberated student should stop

Davidson Should Produce
Men Of Humane Instincts

To The Editor:

“Davidson's primary pur-
pose is to develop men of
humane instincts.” I was dis-
couraged to read that sever-
al students believe this goal
is being properly accom.,
plished by maintaining a
stereotyped student body who
believe in the “traditional
Davidson education.”

I find it hard to see the
value of an education which
produces leaders for the ear-
ly part of this century.

Tl be the first to admit:
ability to converse. over a
cocktail with a Southern
belle, knowledge of liquors
and wines, skill in memoriz-
ing important facts and lists.
learning that I am superior
to some humans (even
though I was born -BY
CHANCE to white parents
rather than black parents),
cleverness in diving reviews
and snowing professors, pro-
ficiency in cleaning and dis-
mantling my own M-l—yes.
all of these are extremely
important in a liberal educa-
tion.

Thus we find that David.
son offers us a perfect back-

ground preparation for life
as an upper-middle class
professional man who joins
the ‘right’ church. and the
“right clubs. But what
about the rest of the world?

We have no specific cours-
es about Africa, India. Asia
(until 1969). or South Amer-
ica. Of course very few peo
ple live in these countries
and their contributions to the
world are nil.

But let me hasten to add
that we do offer courses on
the making of a general,
identification of ‘‘hill zones”
and “the enemy.” and the
fine art of defending our na-

tion against the communist
monolith.

Yet. we are supposed to
develop men of humane in-
stincts. Why not have a
“ROTC program” to prepare
students for VISTA or Peace
Corps services; are Davidson
students so interested in ac-
quiring ‘‘an education” that
they lack time to learn to
help others rather than
learning to clean an obso-
lete weapon?

_Is it so preposterous to
suppose that a Christian,
church-related college could
teach its students to help
their fellow men? I say NO.

Is it preposterous to think
that our students are ‘‘step-
ping out of line’ and hurting
our ‘image’ by trying to
help the black people of this
country? They have advanc-
ed little so far because peo-
ple have feared that their
‘image’ might be hurt.

Our ‘image’ should be of
the man with humane in-
stincts who has had educa-
tional enlightenment and at-
tained cultural maturity by
helping others to help them-
selves and not just by living
a life of seclusion and lack
of concern for those less for-
tunate than we.

1 hate to disappoint some
but I do not have long hair
or a beard: I take baths; I
am not a Communist. Thus

I'am not in a minority of
one.

I am discontented, which
some feel is bad for David-
son’s image; but I would re-
mind these people that the
most famous discontented
personage in ‘the past was
probably none other than the
man Jesus who lived among
the poor, wore a beard, and
was called an outside agita.
tor by his enemies.

Take a moment to reflect
what might happen if Christ
had marched in the picket
line in front of Johnson's
Baber Shop.

I believe in Davidson for
its purpose. It has produced
great men and numerous
leaders but I believe we can
produce men who are better
prepared for 1968 and the
problems which confront our
society. .

Davidson has an unlimited
opportunity to provide hu-
manitarian. educated, objec-
tive leaders not just for Mt.
Mourne or Greenwood but
for the entire world.

But whether we be pre-
med or pre-ministerial we
need to remember: Most of
the people of the world are
neither Presbyterian, nor
white, nor American—THEY
ARE HUNGRY.

Associate Editor
Will Chambers Become Lingle Manor?

Remember way back in January when Dr. D. Grier
Martin announced his resignation as Davidson’s presi-
dent? And remember all the fanfare and flurry about
how trustees, faculty and even students would all join
hands in finding a new president?

_ Ah yes, it was a grand scene! The generous Mr.
Lingle invited students to form a committee to sub-
mit candidates for the office. Student Council mem-
bers and columnists on this newspaper hailed the. in-
vitation as a major step toward student power, what-
ever that meaningless phrase really means.

Now here it is April, and do we have a winner? No.
No one has been named for the job.

The student committee has filed a list of candi-
dates. But other than that, the committee seems to
have had little influence. on the decision-making pro-
cess. One member of the committee said that he has
no idea how many times the trustee committee has met
or what progress has been made toward naming a presi-

ent.

___ Students should have been skeptical of this offer
in the first place. The trustees suggested the formation
of the student advisory committee so that there would
be one body to represent student opinion. The sugges-
tions would be funneled through the committee to the
trustees, thus giving the committee a fairly strong
position as the final authority on student views.

But then the trustees weakened the position of the
committee by offering to accept student suggestions
directly. Mr. Lingle offered to consider any suggestion
submitted to him by a student. Therefore, the trustees
established lines of communication which ignored the
student committee. If this policy was to be acceptable,
T wonder why a committee was formed in the first
place.

Then after the list of candidates was submitted,
Students were never consulted or even informed con-
cerning the progress of the selection process.

What has happened to the selection process? Are
we going to have a new president soon? Will Mr. Lingle
foliow the steps of his father who, while chairman of
the board of trustees in 1929, appointed himself presi-
dent to succeed another President Martin? Will Dr.
Samuel Spencer be hired?

___ Who knows? If someone does, he’s obviously keep-
ing quiet. But the silence of the trustees has led many
students to believe that the president was in fact chosen -
months ago. The announcement has not been made,
they feel, because the trustees want to foster the myth
that they really have considered student suggestions.

These skeptics think the new president to be either
Dr. Samuel Spencer of Mary Baldwin or Mr. Lingle
himself.

I’m going to make no prediction here. Nor will I
completely endorse the above theory. But it is time
that Mr. Lingle and the gang let us know how things
are going at the soap factory.
