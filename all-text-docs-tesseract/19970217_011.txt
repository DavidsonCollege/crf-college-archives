THE DAVIDSONIAN

Palatable Pleasures

Better than beans and just as cheap

By Jecrery CroMartie
Chef-in-Residence

Life basically boils down to
borrowing energy from other stuff.
The trick is to be able to utilize the
energy to drive your cellular meta-
bolic pathways before the environ-
ment decides to rather viciously re-
claim the borrowed energy. Any-
way, one. good way to stay one on
top of the nasty energy sucking win-
ter chills is to eat. Eat a lot.

As Americans we somehow
came up with the idea that it is our
God-given right to have lots of ev-
erything at no cost. Well, when we
are talking food, there are many
options that are packed with usable
energy that cost very little. I’m
talking about pasta. I’m talking
about beans. I’m talking about
rice. Even at Harris Teeter, these
food stuffs are cheap. More Value
macaroni and cheese sells at 5 boxes
for a dollar. Each box feeds pro-
vides a large one course meal for
two full-grown, hungry, drooling
males or one female athlete. Sure
you have to add a little milk or
butter, but the total cost of the meal
will not more than 30 cents per
person. Also, you are getting the

best kind of energy source, com-
plex carbohydrates; these puppies
keep you going strong. Just ask a
runner.

* ‘Need a protein source? I sug-
gest little baby plant embryos; I
mean beans. I go for red kidney
beans over rice with onions and
spicy peppers. Beans are cheaper
than expensive. dirt, and they taste
better. However, there are a couple
draw backs to beans. First, if you
buy dried beans, then you have to
soak them which takes a few hours.
You are well aware of other side
effects which can be avoided if you
choose to predigest your food with
the enzyme beanohydrogenase. Red
beans and rice can be a delicious
and filling meal at very little cost.

Keep in mind that the Com-
mons charges you $6 for every din-
ner. Sure, you have many more
options at the Commons like mint
chocolate chip ice. cream, but you
could by 30 boxes of mac and cheese
for the cost of one meal there. The
cool part about eating at the Com-
mons is that you don’t have to wash
the dishes, and there are plenty of
entertaining people to sit and chat
with. Pleasing everybody is impos-
sible, but the Commons always

seems totry. However, if you want

to save some dough stick.to-the .

staples during the week, and with

the money you saved buy salmonor |

tenderloins on the weekend and live
it up.
Enough Dogma: Let us Cook!

LastnightI wentuptoWakeForrest .

to watch my culinary mentor in
action. Ronney showed yet another
simple yet elegant dish — Bruchetta.

Take some garlic buds (.5 to 1
clove) and peel and mince it. Add
a dash of olive oil and wrap the
paste in foil. Put the foil pack in the
oven to roast for about 10 minutes
at around 350 F.

While the garlic is roasting,
take some cherry tomatoes (about a
dozen) and cut them into eighths.

Slice up a about a quarter of a
red onion (they look purple to me).

Next, chop up some fresh ba-
sil, and grate some parmesan.

Mix every thing together, in-
cluding the garlic, in a large bowl
and add salt and pepper.

Slice up some french bread and
brush the pieces with olive oil.

Spoon the mix over the bread
and bake at 350 F for 10-15 min.

Hope you enjoy.

Hornet’s Nest swarms
Charlotte, leaves readers stung.

By GreG GARRISON
Staff Writer

I’ve just read Hornet’s Nest by
Patricia Cornwell, and I’m honestly
ambivalent about her newest novel.

The story revolves around
Andy Brazil, a rookie reporter, and
Virginia West, the Deputy Chief of
police. Brazil’s assignment for the
Charlotte Observer is to experi-
ence firsthand the life of a police-
man and to write stories about them
for the newspaper.

Right before Brazil receives his
assignment, a serial killer begins
murdering businessmen who are
visiting Charlotte. The killer then

. paints a black-widow-spider-style
hourglass on the victims’ crotches.

While Brazil is learning what it
is like to be a cop and relaying
stories to the public, West is search-
ing for the black widow killer. Al-
though at first she dislikes Brazil,
the two grow close.

Never having read a Cornwell
before, I looked forward to reading
it with great anticipation. I had
heard that her books were exciting,
interesting, and fun, and although I
enjoyed it, the book didn’t really
meet my expectations. —

The characters are exactly that
— characters, notreal people. When
they are in danger or about to dis-
cover a secret or make.a decision, I
didn’t have the on-the-edge-of-my-
seat experience that I often have
with action stories.

Often, reviewers refer to a book
as “a real page turner.” This over-
used phrase is not particularly ap-
plicable to Hornet’s Nest. The plot
is pretty thin, and it often drags.

Having said that, though, I must
admit that I enjoyed the book and

‘about places

would recom-
mend it to a
friend.

One thing
that I enjoyed
about the novel
was the setting;
it’s set in Char-
lotte and
Davidson, and
Iloved reading

and locations
that I know
well.
Another
merit was the
strength of the
female charac-
ters. Strong
women are so
rarely charac-
ters in crime

novels that the prevalence of them
in Hornet’s Nest was a treat. The
women were not weak, fearful, or
spineless, and they did not depend
on men to get them out of danger-

’ ous situations. There should be far

more stories like this.

Having heard a little bit about
how Cornwell got her start as a
writer and what she’s like as a per-
son, I enjoyed trying to figure out
which character she made herself.
It may be presumptuous to believe
that she’s any character, but I do it
in my own stories, so I assume that
many other writers do it in theirs.

There seem to be little bits of

Cornwell in many of the characters,

and I got the feeling that by writing |
about Davidson and by making
Andy Brazil’s career much like the
early days of her own, she had a
blast writing this book.

Hornet's Nest reminds me of

old pulp fiction, like Doc Savage or
Fu Manchu, where action, not char-
acters or plot, is the star. Having
read plenty of pulp, let me assure
you that this is a big plus for me.

The gteatest difference be-
tween Hornet's Nest and the other
books, however, is that Cornwell is
amuch more careful and interesting
writer than Kenneth Robeson or
Sax Rohmer were.

To make a long story short if
it’s not too late, the book has its
strengths and weaknesses, and I’d
suggest that you go out and buy it,
except that 20-odd dollars is adamn
sight too much to pay for almost
any book when you’re a college
student.. Wait a year and get the
paperback. It’s a book written for
the sake of entertainment, so don’t
expect The Brothers Karamozov,
sit back, relax, and let yourself be
entertained.
