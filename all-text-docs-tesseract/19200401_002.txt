game promises to be as fast and as| onds.
interesting as the two of last week.
The Catawba team comes with
more or less mystery surrounding
them. Having played only one game
this season they carinot easily be
sized up. The strong Lenoir Col-
lege team barely nosed them out in
their first start. It is reported that
they have an exceedingly strong
battery. Unusual ability is credited
their well known catcher and at
least one good pitcher is on the
staff. If this is so the two teams
will be fairly evenly matched in this
respect for they are to play only one
game, calling for only one pitcher.
This is the first appearance of the
Catawba representative at Davidson
for several years. The last game
that Davidson played them was on
their home grounds, so no past
record helps to point out the victor,
for Thursday. |
The Davidson team is in good
shape. Several of the bunch have
complained of sore arms but with
the week end rest they should have
rounded into shape. Johnson has
been under the cover for the past
few days with a healthy case of the
mumps. He will no doubt be missed
but with Wrenn to rely upon and a
one game series to be played the
team will be in good condition.
Since Davidson is expecting some
rather strong opposition it seems
to point to a good game for the
spectators. The showing of Cat-
awba will nevertheless be watched
with interest due to the fact that
they are fairly new on the hill.

L. B. SCHENCK HEADS
BASKETBALL |

TEAM NEXT YEAR. |

The Davidson basketball team is
very fortunate in having as its Cap-
tain next year Louis B. Schenck, a
veteran player and athlete as well
as leader in many other college
activities. Mr. Schenck had the mis-
fortune of injuring his knee early
this season which prevents him from
playing the remainder of the year.
Next year it is hoped that he will,
have better luck and that under his
leadership the Wildcats will surpass
the records which they have hung
up in the past.

The prospects for the team next
year are exceedingly bright. Though
it will be hard to fill the places of
Chalmers, this years Captain, and
Hall star forward, both of whom will
graduate this Spring, there will be
an abundance of material to draw
from and Davidson will be assured
of a team that will uphold the for-
mer honors of the Alma Mater.

LET’S GO TO CHARLOTTE.
WATCH WILDCATS WIN.

A-I-l—A-b-o-a-r-d—Speciat train
to Charlotte for the A. and E. game
on April 10, The baseball manager
has been working for this a long
while and although final plans can
not be shaped, it is safe to say that
an extra coach or so will be put on
the 12 o’clock train that day and a
special train.back to Davidson that
night.

The railroad agent states that un-
less the boys patronize this accom-
modation of the company, it will be
difficult to get service-in the future.
So fellows save your pennies, bor-
row, attach, any way get the cash
and all turn out the 10th, and show
N. C. State and Charlotte that ol’
D. C. is still on the map.

It is going to be a good game, that
is assured, and as a matter of fact
should be the best game of the
season. Everybody should see the
Wildcats Top the Tallies of the Ag-
gies. Fellows, let’s go four hundred
and fifty strong, and help.the team
win.

DIAMOND DUST

“Shep” labled one of Richardson’s
offerings across third base for a
couple of sacks in Thursdays game,
but the ump saw otherwise and as
a result the Wilmington lad was
robbed of a hit.

“Cop” dinn’t bunt the old pill two
feet in the eighth, but by the time
the Oak Ridge team finished booting
the sphere around, the Charlie Chap-
lin backstop was resting peacefully

on the third sack.

On the above mentioned play,
Gardner trying to get Richards go-
ing to second heaved the pill to cen-
ter field. With a roaming attitude
the ball rolled through center field-
ers legs which resembled a wicket,
and ambled leisurely toward the
fence. Meanwhile “Johnnie” dented
the rubber with the winning tally.’

Why did “Barney Oldfield” Currie
run for Miley in Thursday’s game?
You can’t find out in speed circles
here so you might as well inquire
elsewhere.

McArn’s pickup of Cassell’s throw
in the seventh was along the spec-
tacular variety. If this keeps up
Connie Mack will be getting our
“Caruso” away from us.

“The early bird gets the worm” |
according to Philosophy. But wait!
Ask “Cop” if this works when you|
leave third for home before a sacri-|
fice fly has been caught.

With Cassell and Shepherd on in
the first, inning, Richard’s signal
may have been to sacrifice—but the
result looked like a marathon race
between the Oak Ridge outfield to-
ward the fence.

Did you notice that “shoulder mo-,
tion” in Miley’s delivery which so
baffles the baserunners? Wonder
why Bill doesn’t try to get a posi-
tion as instructor at “FOX's”.

Who brought in the winning run
of Wednesdays swatfast? With the
score five all in the sixth, Wrenn
lived on an error, McArn advanced
him two pegs and Eris Cassell’s
bingle to left brought Wrenn across
with the winning tally.

If baseball hides cost like shoe
soles it must be rather expensive to
play games like the recent two
where twenty-five clean hits were
made.

Was the music there? I'll say it
was. Captain Mueller’s Original
Jazzarime Band furnished the har-
mony (?) in abundance.

Keels Burgess was on the Hill
Sunday visiting his brother, Sam,
‘21. He will be one of the '24 bunch.

cat victory. The pitching and all
around playing of Richardson fea-
tured for the losers. He secured a
brace or hits in three attempts and
scored one of his teams runs. The
Oak Ridge nine made a wonderful
stab at victory in the ninth by stag-
ing a rally that only come one short
of the mark, but Miley worked out
of the hole after two tallies had been
shoved across.
