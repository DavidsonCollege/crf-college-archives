. Anne DeLattre Brings New

Opportunities to Davidson

By JENNIFER SIECK

Professor Anne DeLattre is
teaching this semester at Davidson
as Distinguished Visiting Profes-
sor of International Studies. De-
Lattre’s third teaching experience
at Davidson, she finds Davidson
College “very stimulating. . . The
students are on the whole very
hard working and bright and eager
to learn.” DeLattre is teaching two
Center for Special Studies courses:
African Development Trends and
The Integration of Europe. She
brings impressive resources to
these courses and to Davidson.

From the Universite de Paris,
DeLattre earneda Baccalauret and
Licence des Lettres. She then trav-
eled to the United States to com-
plete Masters of Arts at both Co-
lumbia and Johns Hopkins Uni-
versities. She began her career
working as an economist for the
International Monetary Fund.
Later, as an economic journalist in
France, she edited a weekly news-
letter until 1962 when she began
working for the Organization for
Economic, Cooperation and De-
velopment (OECD). Her focus with
the OECD wasalways on develop-

ment problems and policies, and in
1976 she became founding direc-
tor of the Club du Sahel, a position
she held until her retirement from
the OECD in 1988.

DeLattre has traveled exten-
sively throughout her career. In
1953 she spent a year in Iran; she
did much traveling in Asia, the
Middle East, and A frica when serv-
ing on the Board of Directors of the
International Food Policy Research
Institute from 1982-88; and 30 to
50 percent of her time in the past 14
years has been spent in West Af-

rica. She has crossed the Sahara
Desert, and her favorite country is
Niger. In January, she will return
to Africa on a project to develop
economic integration in West Af-
rica, sponsored by the OECD and
the African Development Bank.
DeLattre enjoys “very much”
living in the United States. “I find
this country very dynamic, open
and capable’ of responding to all
sorts of challenges : . . I like the

American encrgy. [like the Ameri-
can feeling that problems can be
solved... 1 think perhaps I’m more
American than European in my
outlook on life.”

DeLattre also finds life in
Davidson amenable. “It’s a won-
derful place from every point of
view--a beautiful campus and
unbelievable facilities for stu-
dents.” She particulary enjoys
taking advantage of the college
library and the swimming pool.

Caffiene: A Legal Addiction

Caffeine is considered the
“single most widely used psy-
choactive drug” -- interesting way
of looking at it, isn’t it? Although
some controversy exists as to
whether caffeine is a dangerous
_drug or a needed but unharmful

rounding caffeine is concerned,
there is no concrete evidence that
caffeine causes cancers of the uri-
nary tract, breast, ovary or pan-
creas, Although some studies have
supported this, many have been
criticized or disproved by contra-

caffeine exist in Vivarin, soft
drinks, coffee and tea, but also in
chocolate and in over-the-counter
medications such as Anacin, Ex-
cedrin, Dristan and Sinarest. Caf-
feine is also used to flavor many
processed and baked foods, but it’s

boost of energy, it has been proven
that caffeine is physically addic-
tive. A tolerance to caffeine can be
built up. “Quitting” caffeine can
cause withdrawal symptoms, even
when the person who “quits” has
only been drinking one cup of
coffee a day.

Some withdrawal symptoms of
caffeine include headache, insom-
nia, irritability and listlessness. The
reasons why you must go through
this morning hell if you are used to
a cup of coffee before class but
don’t have time to get one have to
do with a chemical in the brain
called adenosine. Without caf-
feine, adenosine is uninhibited, and
can continue dilating blood ves-
sels as it normally does, causing
headache and fatigue. fe

Withdrawal symptoms can
begin as soon as 12-24 hours after
caffeine is consumed. This means
that, for example, someone who
typically has no caffeine at night,
but has a morning cup of coffee,
may experience a mini-withdrawal
every day!

As far as the controversy sur--

dicting information. Another study
suggests that caffeine increases
athletic endurance when ingested
one to two hours before exercise,
butthis has not been proven either.
Studies linking caffeine to irregu-
lar heartbeats are largely un-
founded. Caffeine has been linked
to infertility, but as yet it is uncer-
tain whether this connection is
valid. Itisrecommended that preg-
nant women try to cut their caf-
feine consumption, especially
during the first few weeks of preg-
nancy, because the fetus has not
developed the necessary enzymes
to break down caffeine, and caf-
feine can remain in the baby’s
system until a considerable time

- after birth.

I used to believe that I hadn’t
taken any caffeine into my system
since 1985 when I went to Lenin-
grad and couldn’t drink the water.
All we had was Pepsi and tea. My
hands were shaking the whole time,
so I swore I'd never drink soft
drinks again. However, I didn’t

" anticipate that caffeine is practi-

cally unavoidable. Not only does
