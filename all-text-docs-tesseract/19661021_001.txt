Church attendance by David-
son College students ‘during the
first six weeks of the semester
as compared with last year's at-
tendance has been varying in
different degrees in the several
Davidson churches.

Rey. Paul Lowder, minister
of Davidson Methodist. Church,
stated that weekly attendance by
Davidson students has _ been
averaging approximately 35.
This is an appreciable decrease
from last year’s average. |

Lowder said that at times
last year the attendance reach-
ed a peak of about 125 students.
But attendance depended mainly
upon the type of week-end activ-
ities in which the students had
been engaged. Attendance on
concert and dance weekends
was exceptionally low.

During the first four weeks of
this semester approximately
ohe-half of the entire student
body was in attendance at
either Davidson College Presby-
terian Church or St. Alban’s
Episcopal Church.

Rev. Will H. Terry, pastor of
Davidson College Prebyterian
Church, stated that student at-
tendance at his church over the
first four weeks ranged from
350 to 400, but this number has

decreased in the last two Sun-

days to only 200 to 250.
Terry emphasized that church

attendance by the Davidson stu- .

dents has been better than ex.
pected.

Social Sciences Get
Council’s Scrutinization

By BOB BUCHANAN
Staff Writer

An independent study is now
in progress to evaluate the
Davidson Social Science Depart-
ment.

The study is being undertaken
by the Student Council Sub-Com-
mittee on the Social Sciences,
composed of two political sci-
ence majors, juniors Julian
Prosser and Mike Powell.

“The motive behind this
study.” Powell said, ‘is to re-
quest that the Faculty curricu-
lum Evaluation Committee put
the proper emphasis on the so-
cial sciences in Nght of student
demands.”’

The study will be carried out
primarily through a social sci-
ence questionaire which is dis-
tributed by the council sub-com-
mittee to a cross-section of the
student body.

Said Prosser, ‘This question-
naire was modeled after the one
presented‘by the Religious Life
Committee last year.”

“This is not an opinion poll,
he continued. “This is a study of
individual opinion. and each
questionaire will be evaluated
considering whose it is.”

“There will. be no majority
vote.” added Powell. ‘No tabu-
lation will be made at all.’ The
results of this examination are
to be given to the proper admin-
istrative offices.

Powell stated that in general,
the main question to be answer-
ed by the questionaire is ‘‘As-
suming that the Social Science
Departments are at their very

best under the existing circum-
stances of curriculum and of
manpower, ‘what if anything,

WAR GETS CREDIT

By ROBERT PYEATT
Staff Writer

‘Increased Army manpower
requirements have caused a
significant increase in applica-
tions for advanced ROTC at
Davidson, but the increase has
not been as great as at some
other colleges and universities,"
Colonel Frederick B. Outlaw,
professor of military science,
stated this week.

“In recent years we have had
an average of 60 per cent of
the rising juniors taking advanc-
ed ROTC, This year 65 per cent
of the junior class are taking
advanced ROTC," he continued.

Outlaw said that this year
about 75 per cent of the rising
juniors applied for advanced
ROTC. About 20 were rejected
‘or physical reasons and some
were rejected for reasons, such
as attitude and academic re-

cord.

The change in advanced
ROTC enrollment, Outlaw cx-
plained has not been as great at
Davidson because there was al-
ready a high percentage in the
advanced program.

There were also some appli-
cations from seniors this year
to compress the program into
one year. Although there is a
precedent for this in the Junior
Year Abroad program, these
applications require approval
from Third Army Headquar-
ters, Outlaw pointed out.

Students taking advanced
ROTC and those on ROTC
scholarships get a military de
ferment, classification 1-D, to
complete undergraduate work
and go to graduate school.

Students not taking advanced
ROTC are classified for draft
purpose on the basis of either
class standing on score on the

and consider the duties of the
college chaplain. .

Much of the procedure is in
doubt. because of the by-law
changes.

All committees were enlarged
to include each board member
in a committee. rather than
having all committees composed
of only the Executive Commit-
tee members.

IFC Seeks
Telephone
Solution

The Interfraternity Council is
working toward the possibility
that a new telephone trunk line
might be brought in to David-

. son from the main line on U.S.

21.

Bobby Vagt, sophomore IFC
representative from Pi Kappa
Alpha, said that there was a
critical shortage of available
lines in Davidson. ‘‘At least six.
fraternity houses would like an
additional line. The IFC is work-
ing on this. It would cost about
$1500 to bring in a new line
pos-
sible.”’

Vagt added that a new line
could benefit the entire commu-
nity. ‘Besides the extra phones
for the fraternity houses. phones
could be installed in the faculty
offices .on Jackson Court: and
the citizens on party lines could
obtain a private line.”

Grover Meetze, director of the
college plant. said that if enough
campus groups want a line, the
college might pay for it. There
is also the possibility that the
telephone company might pay
for the installation.

At the end of the past school
year the Phi Gamma Delta fra-
ternity canceled their telephone

on Patterson Court.

ROTC Rolls Increase

Selective Service College Quali-
fication Test.

A student must be in the
upper half of his freshman class,
in the upper two-thirds of his
sophomore class and in the
upper 3% of his junior class in
order to retain his student defer-
ment. He must be in the upper
fourth of his graduating class
to be deferred for graduate
school.

A score of 76 on the Selec.
tive Service College Qualifica-
tion Test is required for a de-
ferment for four years of un-
dergraduate study and a score
of 80 is necessary for a grad-
uate school deferment.

“I would strongly recom-
mend that all students who have
not done so and are not in
advanced ROTC take the Selec.
tive Service College Qualifica-
tion Test,’ Outlaw emphasized.

Outlaw anticipates that Army

4 Teams
To Visit
Schools

Fina! preparations for the
Student Council ‘‘Educational
Planning” program were for-
mulated this week in hopes of
its inception in two or three
weeks.

The program, first proposed
by council Vice-President Tom
Earnhardt, consists of four
teams of three students each
who will speak at a number of
high school assemblies in the
Carolinas.

Earnhardt stressed that the
programs “are to be offered by
the student body of Davidson
as a service project, not merely
a propaganda speech for David.
son College.”

In a prepared letter to be
sent to principals of the high
schools, he pointed out that the
program will deal with three
subjects—choosing the right col-
lege, the immediate post-high
school years as a period of pro-
found change and a “‘challenge
to success.”

‘Stating that the program
would also be beneficial for
those students not going to col-
lege, Earnhardt said that as
far as he knew “‘it is unique
for a student-oriented group to
undertake such a project.”

H. Edmunds White, admis-
sions director. stated that al-
though the admissions depart-
ment had ho specific authority
in the program, there was a
tremendous enthusiasm for the
success of the project.

In the letter, Earnhardt con.
tinued by saying. ‘“‘The pro-
gram was prepared by a group)
of 12 juniors and seniors who
worked closely with the dean of
students (Richard C. Burts).
the director of admissions
(White), director of alumni. ac-
tivities (Bill Bondurant), and
assistant. director of the College
Union (Tom Covington).”

The project will be offered
free to the high schools, with
each presentation scheduled for
35 to 40 minutes in length. If
“Educational Planning” is well-

received, Earnhardt said, there|-

could quite possibly be trips to
Atlanta, Richmond and even
more distant points.

The students involved in the
project are Joe Jelks, Bill Wat-
son and Vince Foster in ore
group: Ron Hunt, Mike Mooty
and Chuck Matthews in the
second; Mike Booe, Tom Frist
and Earnhardt in the third; and
Tom Rhodes, Ken Autrey and
Rick Mildner in the fourth
group.

manpower requirements will re-
main about what they are now
for the next several years.

He gave the length of the con-
flict in Viet Nam and the ulti-
mate settlement of that con.
flict as reasons, pointing out
that the final settlement might
require large American forces.

“Our basic instruction has not |.
changed,” he remarked. ‘‘We
have placed more emphasis on
certain aspects of the advanced
ROTC program.”

Enrollment in ROTC this year
includes 261 freshman, 258
sophomores, 143 juniors and 107
seniors. About 47 percent of the
senior class is participating in
the advanced program. This
figure does not include appro-
mately 13 per cent dropped for
physical reasons, There are
eight students on four-year
ROTC scholarships and four on
two-year ROTC scholarships.

insured by the FHA. In this way
the families are assuted of hav

The Davidson Mayor's Com
mittee on Human Relations, a
representative group from the
community, has revealed plans
to develop a new housing pro
ject here in Davidson.

The committee, whose chair-
man is H. B, Naramore, mana-
ager of Bridgeport Fabrics in
Davidson, has been working on
this project for over a year now.

Dr. Daniel D. Rhodes, pro-
fessor of Bible and religion and
a member of the committee,
“a
total community project, whose
purpose is to provide real estate
for families with modest income.
who want to own better homes.”

“It is intended to help those
people having difficulty in find.
ing adequate housing get decent
homes of their own.” he said.

Rhodes added that it. may
turn .oul to be a predominant-
ly Negro housing development

“The company will use a
variety of patterns, but it will
be able to give somewhat cheap.
er rateS when building a large
number of units,’ continued
Rhodes.

The people who participate
will be able to specify the type
of house they want.

“We expect to take the names
of those people interested in this
project in fhe near future,”’ ex-
plained Rhodes. ‘’We. will try to
determine then how many peo-
ple are interested and thus how
many units will be called for in
the first round of building.”

Rhodes added. that this project
should help to alleviate the hous-
ing in Davidson, which he call-
ed critical at all income levels.

Not only would it provide
many new houses for people who
want to own their own homes.

‘but it will. also provide old

houses, many of which are in
fairly good shape, for other cit-
izens who cannot afford to buy
new houses at the present time,
