Athletic Director search avai to x

Two Davidson alums possibilities for Holland’s old position

By Matr Pitzer

One of two Davidson gradu-
ates involved in sports administra-
tion could return to his collegiate
roots.

A third person, not a Davidson
graduate, could join the commu-
nity.

- John Gerdy, ‘Davidson’s all-
time leading men’s basketball
scorer, and alumnus Jim Murphy,
currently an assistant athletic di-
rector at Georgia Tech, are two of
the three finalists for Davidson’s
vacant athletic director position.

The third finalist is Tom
‘ Shupe, an associate athletic direc-
tor at Virginia Commonwealth.

Several members of the five-
person search committee and other
sources said no candidate has
emerged as the favorite yet. The
three candidates will come to
Davidson within the next two
weeks for in-depth interviews, and
one source said the school hopes to
reach a decision by the end of the
semester.

“We all probably have our in-
dividual favorites, but I don’t think

there is a group consensus yet,”
one source said.

Still, each of the three candi-
dates is intriguing, and speculation
from outside the official ranks of
the school and administration has
centered on the possibility of bring-
ing Gerdy to Davidson.

As one of five players to have
his jersey retired and a recent in-
ductee into the Davidson Hall of
Fame, Gerdy is certainly the most
widely-known name on the short
list.

But one source said the school
may have trouble luring Gerdy,
until recently the associate com-
missioner of the SEC in charge of
compliance, academic affairs and
rules interpretations, away from

his current roots in New York City.:

Committee members seem to
realize the name value and recog-
nition that Gerdy could continue to
bring to the school after the well-
known Terry Holland left to take
the same position at Virginia in the
spring.

Said one member, political
science professor Tom Kazee,
“[Gerdy’s] familiarity with
Davidson and what Davidson does

Field hockey

Dealing with a less predict-
able season than last year’s and an
unexpected tournament move from
Davidson to Appalachian State due
to wet fields, Davidson’s field
hockey team finished its season
with a Depp South Tournament
championship like they have done

FIELD HOCKEY

for the past six years.“*Last year we
cruised through the season, but this
weekend we had to really step up
to the challenge to win the tourna-
ment. We came through and did a
great job. It was a lot of fun,” said
an enthusiastic Erin Smith. Smith,
a sophomore, scored one of the
goals during Saturday’s 5-0 win
over the Catawba College Lady
Indians.

Holly Kledis, a senior, earned
MVP. Shescored two goals against
Catawba and set the tone in the
next round match-up with Appala-
chian State when she scored the
first goal of the game midway
through the second half off an as-
sist.

The other goal in the Appala-
chian game came from senior
Nicole Ficeto on a short penalty
corner. The Wildcats held the
Mountaineers to a 2-0 final score.
Ficeto, along with juniors Heather
McAlpine and Mary Dowd, were
named First Team Deep South
Tournament players at the end of
the championship game.

“T would say that this has been
an up-and-down season,” said head

coach Betsy Pryor. ““We had some

~diffieatties early on, but this week- >

end we were feeling really posi-
tively.”
The championship game for

‘the Wildcats was one of emotion.

There was a lot of ball movement,
but Davidson clearly had control.
Only after Kledis’s score did the
Cats look like they knew they were
going to win. “They fought hard,”
said Pryor about her players in the
Appalachian game.

Ficeto and Kledis won’t be
wearing the red and black uniform
next year, but the future still looks
bright for the Davidson field
hockey program. Three freshmen
started regularly this season. One
of them, Lindsey Parker, had an
important role as sweeper in
Sunday’s game. She repeatedly
thwarted the opponent’s attempts
to'score and picked up the pace of
the defense in the scoreless first
half. “Lindsey is a tough, tough
player,” commented coach Pryor.
“It was so appropriate that Nicole
and Holly scored the only two goals
in their last game at Davidson.”

athletically would be assets. We’re
very impressed with his under-
standing of what Davidson and
Davidson athletics are all about.”

All members, however, cau-
tioned against considering anyone
the front-runner and said that se-
curing another well-known candi-
date to replace Holland was not
vital.

“We're not looking at names,”
one source said. “We're definitely
looking at each one’s qualifica-
tions. If the name comes with it,
that’s great... . Terry Holland got
us out into the public realm and got
us the publicity. Now we’re just
going for the qualifications, not
the names.”

Echoed committee member
and vice president for institutional
advancement Toby Bethea, “Idon’t
think the name is as important as
the qualifications. I think it’s more
important to find somebody who
believes intherelationship between
athletics and the mission of the
college and the ethics and morality
of athletics, which are a given here,
but not necessarily at other
schools.”

The committee also seems in-

tent on hiring somebody who is
flexible enough to deal with the
specific challenges Davidson faces
as the smallest coeducational Di-
vision I school in the country.

Also lurking asa problem area
forthe next athletic director is deal-
ing with the almost constant mur-
muring about a possible shift to
Division III, a problem that has
part of its roots in financing prob-
lems.

While no one thinks that
Davidson will make that move
anytime soon, several sources were
quick to point out that something
unforeseeable could happen at any
time.

“We need an A.D. that under-
stands Davidson’s needs to be far-
sighted in that there might be spe-
cific pressures on the school,”
Kazee said. ‘We’ re not looking for
someone whois Division I or noth-
ing or someone who is Division III
or nothing.”

The committee does not ap-
pear to have a specific timetable in
place after:the three candidates
come for their interviews, but it
has reserved the right to open the
search again if none of the three

seems perfect for the job, although
that search would likely be much
more limited than the one which
began this summer. ,

In, 1979, his best year, Gerdy
led the Southern Conference in
scoring with 26.7 points per game
and also led the Wildcats in assists.
He remains second all-time in
Southern Conference scoring and
is also 14th nationally. That year
he was also named honorable men-
tion All-American by The Associ-
ated Press and United Press Inter-
national. He was a third-round pick
in the ‘79 NBA Draft by the New
Jersey Nets, but didn’t make the
team and had a short career in the
Continental Basketball Associa-
tion.

After his playing days, Gerdy
earned a doctorate in sports ad-
ministration from Ohio University
in 1986 before joining the SEC.

Less is known about the other
two candidates, but Murphy ap-
parently has a wide range of power
at Georgia Tech, while Shoop has
helped run a very good program at
Virginia Commonwealth, which is
more similar to Davidson in terms
of its size and budget.
