The most significant works in
the Davidson National are
primarily concerned with
medium.

Indeed, Clinton Hill’s untitled
work of hand molded paper cuts
to the very center of this issue
with the pure aesthetic of the
paper medium itself.

Hill’s work is produced
without the use of any external
graphic depiction that is not a
component of the paper itself.

Freddie Fong’s “Untitled No.
1,” a lithograph, is in effect a
trompe l'oeil of folded brown
paper. Whereas Hill’s paper ac-
tually is paper, Fong uses paper
and lithography to create the
illusion of paper on paper.

“New Art”

Another paper conscious
work is Mark Pierce’s ‘‘Tea
Stained Monologue, Two AM,”
an intaglio-collage. Pierce ex-
ploits the avant-garde concern
with the aesthetics of pén-
manship and __ incidental
markings on paper.

- Pierce’s work may be our
best example of the ‘new art.’’
It reflects evidence of com-
monly shared life experiences
in a primary concernfor media.

Carol Summer’s woodcut,
“Hilo Bay,” is typical of her
work since before the second
World War. It uses a technique
of wet on wet woodcut that was
developed experimetally in the
old WPA fine arts projects... It
deals with the bleeding proper-
ties of paper.

Sue Hettmansperger’s un-
titled - watercolor-pencil
drawing is of paper and uses
color. It is only secondarily
about the image ‘of paper which
serves as the | structural
framework for her particular
exploration of watercolor and
pencil.

There is some exploration 0

metal-flake mixed inks and
pigments in this shéw. This can
be seen in Paul K. Wong’s
‘“*‘Agypten Theatre
(Hologram),”’ a lithograph-
Screen print; in Michi Itami
Zimmerman’s ‘‘jiyu
Murasaki,” an intaglio; and in
its most thorough exploration in
No. 136, Jo Spohn’s “Ink Cans.”

Spohn is able to achieve a
clarity of space and color unlike
any other work in the show.
This is all due to the crystalline
light-holding -properties of
small metal particles.

Drawings Flowe?

As Jackson acknowledges’ in
the catalogue, drawings have
become the major issue for the
juror this year. They demon-
strate a wide range of uses and
techniques.

The delicacy with which
many. of these works were han-
died should « prove’ to make
many of them very popular.

There is much coming to ter-
ms with color in several
drawings. These range from the
flashy to the more subtle: from
David Kessler’s photo-real,
‘Doug’ Custom Trout Door
Handles,” to Douglas Martin’s-
calligraphic ink and_ pencil,

_ “Particle Size.”’

Other drawings dealing suc-
cessfully with color are Roy
Castleberry’s _ pastel-conte
Crayon, “‘Flesh;’’ and Tucker

' Cooke’s pencil, ‘‘April 12-Safari

Lady’s National Gallery Tour
with Cataract Veldt Felt.’’

Serigraphy

Several serigraphs were
selected. This is a. stencil
technique which attempts to
recapture the rich pigmentation
qualities found in paintings, but
it has the advantage of jim-

personal rendering in a flat. sur- |

face.

Perhaps the best direct use of
photography and color in this
show will be seen in Raffaele De
outlandish

serigraph, ‘‘La Terza Cantata,”’
a winner of a Davidon College
Purchase Award.

Jo Baer’s, ‘6,’ demonstrates
a very tightly controlled use of
serigraph. It is quite ‘‘simple”
but very complex in color sen-
sitivity.

Will Barnet’s trendy, orien-
tal, “‘White Stairway,” involves
a highly calculated linear
design with equally calculated
use of color. This work is a
genuine masterpiece. -

This brings us to Jim
Nawara’s gargantuan
serigraph: “Mound Vicinity.”
Although this domineering
work shows ambition and is
based on a very stable abstract
pattern of dots and splotches, it
actually comes off as a tacky,
worm-eaten billboard which
has been erectedin the lobby as

a gimick to “kick” the show. I «

detect many derivations and in- ‘

fluences in this show. Some: of
the big name artists to whom
many of these works are direc-
tly in debt include M.C. Escher,
Albrecht Durer, Hans Har-

should be very popular indeed.

Other works in the show could
be grouped in the categories of
fairy tale fantasy, humorous,
paranoid, psychotic, pop,
nostalgia, still life, and lan-
dscape. ’

Apparently Judith Goldman
is not falling for the Museum of
Modern Art’s sixties’ attempt to
artificially inseminate the art
world with op art. For the first
time there is scarcely a single
piece of op art in a Davidson
National.

Neither will we find any
examples of concepual or idea
art, kinesthesia producing
‘works, collage gimickry, or
prints that move into the realm
of sculpture by the heavy use of
embossing techniques. As one
student who assisted the juror
said, ‘Judith called bullshit on

Masterpieces

Throughout my analysis of
the show I have tried to em-
phasize the uses of media.

However, there are a few.
works which achieve a beautiful
equilibrium between the
psychological-connotative qual-
ities. of their media and the
iconographic meaning of their
creation. It is in these precious
few works that we get a feeling
for the content of the literary
and other story-telling com-
mentaries in hundreds of rejec-
ted entries.
