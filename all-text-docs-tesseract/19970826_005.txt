THE DAVIDSONIAN y WELCOME FRESHMEN MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 1997 .

Take advantage of what Davidson has
to offer — but not just 1 in the classroom _

By MIcHAEL J. Kruse.
Editor in Chief

Welcome, members of the
Class of 2001, to the next four years
of your life — four years that will
(hopefully) consummate the often
rough-and-tumble, trial-and-error
transition from adolescence to adult-
hood.

A mere two years back, I was,
like you are right now, a wide-eyed
frosh lost in the bureaucratic roller
coaster knownas Orientation. Dur-
ing my first few weeks at the Big D,
I kept on having to remind myself
that this was not simply Camp
NoAdultSupervision.

This was the real deal. Here I
was, acollegiate, really and truly on
my own.

And here you are.

‘Everything’s new and unex-
pected. And, if your current state of
mind is anything like mine was that
frantic first weekend, you’ re living
day by day, hour by hour, minute by
minute.

Anything beyond the now is

really irrelevantat this point. You’re
just struggling to determine major
campus landmarks, attend the
plethora of required informational
sessions, stay afloat in a mass swim
test at Cannon Pool, and keep your
dignity while diabolical upperclass-
men lead you through their amus-
ing (for them, not you) Union ob-
stacle course.

And in the middle of this zoo,

: you are trying to make friends, some
- of whom - many of whom, really -

may become life-long comrades.
Think about it: you could meet your
future spouse today. Or tomorrow
at a seemingly ridiculous, pointless
hall mixer. Or maybe you already
have. As incomprehensible as,such
a thought seems right now, it’s the
truth.

I know, it’s all very intimidat-
ing.

So I understand full well that

it’s tough for you to step back, take .

everything in, and seriously assess
your new surroundings and con-
sider what’s to come in both the
near and distant future.

Right now, I’m sure, advice,

instructions, and. suggestions are -

being thrown at you from. every

which way. So I will spare you,

another such rambling discourse.
But I will offer these few pithy

words of wisdom:
You’re here to learn, but not

only — and maybe not even pri- |

marily — in the classroom. In
fact, as much as I’ve learned from
the professors here over the past
two years, the bulk of my learning
has happened outside the walls of
any academic building. As a stu-
dent at Davidson, you’re now sur-

rounded by gobs of smart andinter-_ .

esting people. Get to know them.
Listen to them: They’ re sometimes
the best teachers of all.

Commit yourself to an extra-
curricular. Notice I said commit,
and not.just join. Instead of becom-

ing a blithering resume-stuffer, do-

ing a little of every godforsaken
activity. known to man, pick one or
two and do them .with pride and
energy.

Alwaysmakesure yourdorm |

room has more decorations than
your study carrel. And check your-
self periodically on this one. Be-
cause when your room’s wails are

_ Virtually bare and the pictures of

your loved ones are plastered all
over your personal study hovel in
Little Library, a red warning light
should pop into your head.

For that’s when you know
Davidson is using you, and you are
not using Davidson.
