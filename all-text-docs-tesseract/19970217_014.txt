DAVIDSONIAN

Women avenge early season loss to

Eagles, grab fourth place with win

Carolyn Kirsch scored a game-
high 22 points to lead Davidson
(14-8, 6-5) over Ga. Southern (11-
12,5-6) Saturday in Statesboro, Ga.,
75-62.

The win gave the Wildcats four-
teen for the season, tying the all-
time program high set by last year’s
squad. Davidson will look to break

that record Monday at Tenn.-Chat-
tanooga.

The win over the Eagles
avenged an earlier 66-63 defeat at
Belk Arena in January. The Wild-
cats now stand a game ahead of Ga.
Southern for fourth place in the
conference.

CK, Scooch, Mo leave winning legacy

By MICHAEL Kruse

Sports Editor

It’s about 20 minutes after the
women’s basketball team’s win over
Western Carolina last Monday.

There are two girls playing on
the near hoop in Belk Arena. One
looks to be 10 or 11, the other a
couple years younger.

The older one is wearing a t-

shirt that reads, It’s a man’s

game...Not! She dribbles around
the perimeter, looking to pass to an
imaginary teammate.

“CK, CK, CK,” the younger
one yells from the other side of the
court, calling for the ball.

I take note. CK. Carolyn
Kirsch, of course.

“What’s your name?” I ask the
girl with the t-shirt.

It’s Marilyn or Melody or Har-

mony or something like that. But
it’s not CK.

“Who’s your favorite player?”
I ask, knowing full well what the
answer will be.

“CK,” she says with a smile
and in an of-course tone.

Carolyn Kirsch and fellow se-
niors Monica Winter and Amy
Scalcucci.will play their final regu-
lar season game in Belk Arena Sat-
urday against Marshall.

Along with last year’s class,
the trio has spearheaded the remark-
able ascension of Wildcat women’s

.basketball over the past four years

in the Southern Conference, willing
the squad from perennial cellar-
dweller into legitimate title threat.
The mere fact that there is a
little girl running around the Belk
Arena floor pretending to be CK,
that area youth girls basketball
leaguers come to all the home
games, that they scurry down to the
locker room after them - pen and
program in hand - looking for auto-

graphs, all of this is real-life proof
of just what this class has done for
this team.

After suffering through five-
and four-win seasons in 1992-93
and 1993-94, the Wildcats won a
program-best 14 games last year
and advanced to the league semifi-
nals in Greensboro.

The goal for this season - and a
realistic one - goes beyond the semis.

And Kirsch, Winter, and
Scalcucci were at the heart of this
remarkable emergence, a building
block progression to recognition and
respect.

“This group of seniors has given
the program real credibility here on
campus and inthe conference,” said
coach John Filar earlier this month.

“They’ ve shown the younger ladies ~

what kind of commitment it really
takes to be Division I athletes.”

Winter, earlier this season, be-
came the program’s all-time assists
leader and Scalcucci will leave
Davidson as one its best three-point
markswomen ever.

Kirsch - who dominated the
European continent at an American
high school in Heidelburg, Ger-
many, earning All-Europe hoops
honors three times and, between
basketball, soccer, and volleyball,
capturing eight European champi-

‘ onships overall - was selected sec-

ond team all-league last year, and is
a virtual lock for first team this
season and a very tenable Player-
of-the- Year candidate.

“T couldn’t be happier with the
program,” Kirsch said recently.
“This is my favorite team over the
last four years. I think the coaching
staff has its stuff together and I’m
just really happy overall. Icouldn’t
ask to end my career at Davidson
any better.”

If they don’t yet, the record
books will soon say that Kirsch is

Records to fall this week

By AARON DUNHAM

The two most important
Davidson women’s basketball
records could fall this week.

First, with just one more vic-

tory, the 1996-97 Wildcats would

become the all-time winningest
team in the history of the program.
That milestone will represent
quite an accomplishment for head
coach John
Filar, whores-
urrected the
formerly de-
funct program
just five short
years ago.
Sec-
ondly, senior
standout
Carolyn Kirsch will likely become
the school’s career scoring queen
tonight in Chattanooga, Tenn.
With her 22-point performance
Saturday against Ga. Southern,

Kirsch now has 1293 career points,
just six points shy of Mike
Frankhouser’s mark.

Our Own Crazies

The Davidsonian sports sec-
tion has been very critical of the
poor fan attendance at Davidson
basketball games in recent weeks.
And although we are still disap-
pointed by the number of fans show-
ing up at Belk Arena, we must give
some credit to a particular group of
students who do.

The Phi Delts have been ex-
tremely vocal during the women’s
games this season, firmly establish-
ing themselves as Davidson's
“Cameron Crazies.”

Most often perched behind the
visiting team’s bench, they not only
support the Wildcats and harass the
opponents, but also have a firm
knowledge of the game.

Before the Western Carolina
contest, one Phi Delt brother walked
into the press room to ask if he
could borrow some chairs. The
bunch wanted to hold up chairs
throughout the game to mock Cata-
mounts coach Gary Peters, who
was suspended for the game be-
cause of a chair-throwing incident.

the finest all-around women’s bas-
ketball player in Davidson history.

She is the program’s all-time
leader in rebounds, steals, and free
throws, and will likely become its
most prolific scorer tonight at UTC.

“As of right now, there’s no
doubt. She’s by far the best women’s
basketball player ever to pass
through here,” said Filar. “I hope
one day - and I hope it’s soon -
they'll retire No. 14. I don’t think
anyone else could wear No. 14 quite
like Carolyn Kirsch.”

Indeed. She has left an indel-
ible mark of success on women’s
basketball at Davidson - as a bubbly
personality on and off the court, as
a player unmatched in talent and
production in the program’s annals,
and as perhaps the driving force
behind the creation of a Wildcat
team on which winning is not sim-
ply adream, but an expectation and
a reality.

For anyone ever again to even
have the opportunity to wear No. 14
would be an injustice."

Even so, Kirsch will likely end
her competitive basketball career at
the conclusion of this season, opt-
ing to continue her education rather
than play professionally.

She is a Psychology major and
has applied to six grad schools.

“T mready tolivea life without
competing,” said Kirsch. ‘“‘As it
gets closer and closer, I’m so scared
to have a life without basketball. I
guess I want people to remember
me as somebody who really had a
passion for the game.”

She stumbles alittle, then thinks
for a few seconds.

“T just want them to remember

”

me.

Well, the little girl with the t-
shirt sure will. And chances are,
she won’t be the.only one:
