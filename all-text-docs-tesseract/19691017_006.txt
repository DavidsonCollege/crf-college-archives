Carthage Bans Updike’s Bestseller

Several professors at Carthage College, in Keno-
sha, Wis., have taken a stand against the John Updike
bestseller, ‘‘Couples,’”’ according to the campus paper,
“The Arrow.”

The paper reports that the book was ordered by
the campus bookstore and then returned on delivery
becausegthe store manager, Stanley. Hagan, thought
the book was risque.

The issue has caused quite a controversy among
several of the faculty members, who claim that the
book should not be banned from the shelves.

According to the paper, Hagan cited his reason
for keeping the book as, ‘This is a Christian school,
and I think we have to maintain standards.”

YAF Aims Suits At ‘Tolerant’ Administrators,
Disrupters

Duke University and. the University of North
Carolina are among the 32 colleges and universities
identified by the Young Americans for Freedom as
“priority targets,” in a campaign against students
who disrupt classes. ,

The campaign, labeled the “‘campus freedom of-
fensive,”’ is aimed.at the New Left and members of
the Students for a Democratic Society.

The: YAF intends to bring two kinds of suits, one
against the class disrupters themselves, and the other
— a breach of contract suit — against administrators
who did not maintain uninterrupted classes.

Duke and UNC were the only Southern schools
in the list of institutions where the YAF said its mem-
bers.would “exert special emphasis.”

Park Sees Little Change In Ind

By RICH WILSON
Staff Writer

Reflecting on the last de
cade of India’s current his
tory, Dr. Richard L. Park,
professor of political science
at’ the University of Michi
gan and specialist on South
Asia, predicted what changes
will be made in India during
the next 10 years

Park, who has written nu
merous books on India, de
livered on Tuesday two lec

tures: the first, held in: Per
kin’s auditorium was entitled
“India: “Politics. of Moderi
zation,” and the second held

in Hodson Hall concerned
“India in the 1970's: A Po
litical Projection.”

In both lectures Park
touched on the past and cur
India and

on what will be done to
solve these problems in the
future.

things

because so
many have to be
done, some problems won't
even be approached in the
forthcoming decade.
Concerning the — physical
appearance..of India, Park,
who has lived in Southeast
Asia for 13 years, felt that
in 1980 India will look ex
actly like it does today.
“Ancient civilizations such
as India don’t change: very
fast,’’. he noted. ‘’Because
India is a very poor country,
much will remain untouched,
especially the rural areas.’’
Park illustrated this pain

he did, Polley said, Morri-
son showed his resentment
for what the government was
doing, and his igreat love for
all mankind. The Quaker
hated nationalism and the
influence of the military,
Polley recalled.

Dr. Robert L. Avinger,
Assistant Professor of Eco
nomics, cited some fascinat-
ing population and casualty
statistics which proved that
since the North Vietnamese
‘growth rate is three times as
great as ours, there is in
deed a war of attrition be
ing waged--against us. Pro
portionately, he concluded,

cried how the Army and the
landed aristocracy there are
imeding needed reforms. If
South Vietnam had_ gone
Communist in the fifties, he
said, a _ nationalistic Com
munist state would have de
veloped which China would
not dominate, because of the
traditional hatred of the
Vietnamese people for
China.

Asked about the so-called
“Domino theory,’ according
to which all of South Asia
will fall to Communism if
South Vietnam does, Gaige
rejected it, saying each
country should be considered
separately. Cambodia and
Thailand are stable, he said,
but Laos is in trouble and
‘Burma is a mess.”’

Dr. Ernest F.- Patterson;
Professor of Economics, be-
gan his speech by saying
that he was delighted to see
so many fellow traitors here
today."’ He then dwelt for
some. length. on the contro-
versary surrounding his al
leged ‘‘socialism.”’ ‘‘In any
other country in the world,”
he said, ‘I'd be a_ socialist.
But in America, nobody in
his right mind would be a
socialist.”’

As Dr. Patterson sees
it, the main problem
with Vietnam is the pro
blem of surplus capital.
In the past countries
of Europe’ have’ grabbed
for colonies all around the
world. They would sink their
surplus capital in these col-
onies to get raw materials
for their home | industries.
But since the decline of im-
perialism, such devices as)
higher government spending,
Lend-Lease, and military ex-
penditures have been seized
upon to use up surplus capi-
tal.

In connection with the
birth controls movement,
Park elaborated on some of
the methods which are now
being employed.  ‘‘Sripati
Chandrasekhar, Minister of
Health and Family Planning,
is behind the birth control

drive,” he said.

Although India is large
and is split into many fac
tions, the congress seems to
be ‘able to absorb people
from the right and left.
“Ghandi does her old song
by proclaiming
the socialist line, byt in real
ity the Congress is basically
conservative,"’ he said.

Park sees little threat of
a takeover by the commun-
ist forces or those of the mil
itary in the event of a crisis.
