Y OPONGDRD
BOYS: PROGRAM

Sixty Men Already Participating
In Various Forms Of Boys’
Work

* The Boys’ Work Department of the
Davidson Y. M. C, A. is looking forward
to a highly successful year with ap-
proximately sixty men already partici-
pating in the program: which is under
the direction of Ben Rose and Ed Hodge,
members of the “Y” cabinet,

Since many men carry over into col-
lege their interest in Boy Scouts. and
other organizations, it has been the cus-
tom in the past to maintain these activi-
ties for those interested, and at the same
time render a great service to the boys
of the surrounding communities.

This year the work has been divided
up into five departments, namely: The
Hi-Y group, Football Scouts,
Boys’ Clubs, and a workshop for boys

The Hi-Y group with Archie Shu-
ford, captain, will have Billy Merchant,
Bob Sours, and Haywood Hill as assist-
ants to aid in this work,
will conduct various campaigns to help
the needy, build character, and make
the spirit of Jesus Christ effective in

teams,

These men

each boy's personal, school, and social
life. ?

The football teams, which are under
the supervision of Abbott Whitney, cap-
tain, with Lawrence Reel and J. J. Meg
Nobb as organize the
hoys into several teams, and thus build

assistants, will

up a spirit of competition and frir play
in athletics. ;

The Scouts, with Ed Hodge, Scout-
S. Cook, M. B. Crisp,
Harmon Woodward, R. M. Wilson, Er-
nest Dooley, Harold Sugg, and Dick
Hayworth as assistants, will carry on a
program with whicl® every student at
Davidson is femiliar

The Boys’ clubs, which this year will
be divided into two
white boys and the other

master, and J.

groups, one for
for colored

boys, will have Carlyle Lewis, Jack
Branch, Chester Chase, L. C. Vass, F
S. Furness, Tredway Purnell, John

Walker, and Ernest Dooley in charge.
These men will conduct various® games,
parties,cnd other social activities during
the year. |

The workshop with J. S. Cooke, R. M. |
Wilson, and Bob Sours as_ instructors |
will @gdin conduct classes in the manuel
arts among the boys of the surrounding |
communities. However, due to the re-
moval of old Louisiena dormitory which
served as the workshop. last year, the
classes will not be conducted until a
definite place has been decided upon.
Many recent additions have been made
in the way of tools for the shop, and a
record number of boys are expected to
attend,

Although only a ‘sm: ll number of men
have been assigned so far, to these com-
mittees, more will be added later in or-
der that the best results in these de
partments may be obtained.

New ‘Davidsonian Stat f
Moves Into Elm Row

The editorial and business staffs of
the Davidsonian have moved their perma-
nent-offier-into the east building of Elm
Row, renovetion of which has just been
completed.

The new office for the college weekly
is just opposite the old office in the west
building of Elm Row, which has been
the headquarters of the paper for sev-
eral years. For the past two years,
however, owing to a lack of necessary
space in the old quarters, temporary -of-
fices have been sct up in the parlors of
various dormitories.

The interior of the building, one of
the oldest on the campus, has been com-
pletely gone over, the walls having’ been
papered and the woodwork painted. The
new office will house both the editorial
and business departments of the paper,
and all equipment will be kept there.
The headquarters of the “D" Club, in
the same building, has also
finished.

We begin with the right

mellow them like rare wines
for flavor and taste.
Next we add just the right
kinds and the right amounts
of Turkish tobaccos to give
Chesterfield the “seasoning”

better.
Finally we ‘‘weld”’ these
