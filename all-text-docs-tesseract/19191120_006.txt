It was the first time | had seen
me of your college papers and let
ne tell you what I have even dared
'o tell my own college, and it is
hat “The Davidsonian” is the best
‘-ollege weekly I have ever looked
hru, and you know, we think the
” is pretty good.—An Alum-
‘tus of Another College.

“*The Davidsonian’ is a publica-
_ ion worthy of note, being a five-
column paper of eight pages. It
atries quite a variety of news, and
°§ a paper which the college could
boast of."—An Exchange.

“Please accept this small check

how much we who are at home en-
joy reading about the college. We
have particularly enjoyed — the;

“And in closing allow me to say
hat the present sheet more than
justifies the faith of the paper’s
founders and is indeed a credit to
the college.”—One of the Founders.
