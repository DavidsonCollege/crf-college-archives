Approval Of Campus

By THOM NICOLL
Staff Writer

Reaction this week to the Un
ion Board's proposal to move
the College Union functions to
the Guest House seems to re-
present at least a concensus of
conditional approval.

SGA President Ralph Peeples
stated that the plan is probably
the most practical short-range
measure, though he found the
idea somewhat disappointing.

“You really don't realize the
need for large meeting rooms
until you lose them. I'm also

concerned about important stu--

dent offices such as THE
DAVIDSONIAN and the SGA of-
fices."" he said. ‘I'm not sure
about how they'll fit into the
new plan.

**However, I think that this
has been researched fairly wel!.

I hope that the college remem-'

bers that their first responsibili-
ty is to the student body. es-
peciatly the freshmen."' he con-
tinued. “The way the union
space is appropriated will in-
dicate the administration's at-
titudes. Are they going to try
to serve the student’s needs?”

Dean of Students Will Terry
echoed one of Peeple’s  state-
ments. ‘Until we started to tear

dewn the Union. no one seemed
that attached to it.

The Union is no great center
through which all students pass,
except the freshmen. The activ-
ities of the Union Board. which
are very important, can be car-
ried on adequately in the Guest
House.

‘All we really need is a hub
out of which to operate. The
social functions of the college
will be changed in the near fu-
ture anyway, especially with co-
education, which is inevitable,”
he said.

“This move will enable us to
change the entire focus of so.
cial life. which may become
more centered in the dorms.
The move will damage us only
if we let it because of negative
attitudes.’ Terry said.

Vice-President of Academic
Affairs John Bevan approved
the move. emphasizing. how-
ever, that it was only a tem-
porary measure. He also dis-
cussed the new Union, and
stated. “‘Before we make any
decisions, we had best take a
hard look at our definition of

Southern Railroad donates depot for youth center.

From Depot To Youth Center

By JAMES HANNA
Staff Writer

Youngsters in the town of Da-
vidson will have a student-op-
erated youth center by the
spring of this year if financial
roadblocks can be overcome.

YMCA President Adrian Long
Said that the feasibility of mov-
ing and renovating the old
Southern Railroad depot on De-

have their parties.

Activities on Patterson Court
during the weekend will be
open.

The Davidson Wildcats will
tackle the USC Gamecocks Sat-
urday afternoon in Columbia,
S. C., and that game will be
televised.

Saturday night The Nitty Grit-
ty Dirt Band will perform in
Love Auditorium at 8 p.m.

Following that concert, some
of the new proposals will go
into effect in the form of a
“aight club” in Chambers Din-
ing Hall.

The hall will be redecorated
and improved acoustically to
make a more pleasing and re-
laxed atmosphere, according to
Social Council Chairman Jim
Campbell.

A new stage will be erected,
at the opposite end of the hall
from the present stage area,
with a thrust stage which will
allow the performers to move
around.

Students will be able to sit di-
rectly in front of the stage, and
around the thrust stage, on
mattresses or at tables at the
rear of the room. The middle
area will serve as a dance floor.

Two bars will be in operation
during the concerts, one sery-
ing beer and one mixers.

The ‘Chambers Night Club”
will feature The Hampton
Grease Band, a rock band from
Atlanta, and Betts Midler, a
favorite of The Johnny Carson
Show.

These acts will alternate sets
and run_ until approximately
3 a.m, -

The movie will he shown for
a second time Saturday night,
and the Union Bar will remain
oper. the entire weekend.

pot Street was being studied by
the Business Office of the col-
lege.

“My only fear is that this
project is going to turn out to
be terribly expensive,’ said
Long.

Long explained that the cost
of the center will include mov-
ing the building to a college-
owncd fot. completely finishing
the interior, and hiring a part-
time director for the center.

“The inside of the building
will have to be completely re-
modeled. sinee there isn't any-
thing in it right now,” said
Long.

“We don't want anything fan-
cy or plush, but we do need of-
fices for the YMCA and STEP
programs next year, and we'd
like to have rooms for the STEP
tutors to take thcir pupils, in-
stead of the tulors having to go
to the schools,” he said.

l.cug said that the YMCA has
allocated two thousand dollars
of its funds towards completion
of the project. but that the rest
of the money will have to come
from other sources.

“The Southern Railroad Com-
pany will sell us the building
for one dollar, and the college
will provide the lot, but we

necd to see how much the whole
thing will cost before we can
go ahead.” said ‘Long.

"We hope to get our opcral-
ing expcases from the United
Community Service organiza-
tion. and the town council has
offered to reallocate the funds
from the two teen canteens that
are being closed down, but this
docs not meet our immediate
aveds,”’ he said.

Long was critical of the Da-
idson town council for what he
calls the council's ‘‘lack of re-
sponsiveness” toward the cen.
ter.

“The council is pretty tight.
fisted. and thcy don’t see the
need for a youth center," said
Long. “In fact, I don't think

any of the members of the
council have teen-aged  chil-
dren.”

Long said that the YMCA has
asked the council for funds to
help get the center under way,
but that the “not large amount"
of money formerly going to the
(we cantcens was the only aid
the council would permit.

"We've been planning this for
nearly a year now, and hope-
fully, if the meney becomes
available, we can open the cen-
ter by spring-time,” said Long.

By DAVID HANIG
Staff Writer

The Co-curricular Committee
and the Union are jointly spon-
soring a Black Arts Festival to
give the Davidson student some
idea of Black culture in Africa
and the United States.

The Festival consists of sev-
cral events from January to
April, the first of which was
Vinie Burrow’s show ‘Walk To:
gether, Children.”

The climax of the Festival
will be Ali A. Mazrui, pro.
fessor of political science at
Makerere. University in Ugan-
da, who will be co campus
April 4 through 6 as a Reyn-
olds Lecturer.

According to Peter U. Ster.
ling, Union program coordina.
tor, Mazrui is the leading Af-
rican political scientist today.

According to Sterling, “the
purpose of these programs- all
of which can stand by them-
Selves.- is cultural. We wanted
the Davidscn student to have
Some background before Dr.
Mazrui speaks here.”

As part of the Festival, the
Union will show 10 lunch films
Starling in February and is
renting a collection of African
art to be exhibited in April.

‘Lester Strong is producing
Leroy Jcnes’ one-act play “The
Dutchman,” and The Friend-
ship Baptist Church Choir from
Charlotte will sing in April on
campus.

Sterling stated that Shirlcy
Chisholm, congresswoman from
New York, and poetess Gwen-
dolyn Brooks had both been in-
vited but that, as yet, the Un-
ion had received no answer from
them.
