Bailey Reports on Case;
Suspicious Auto Seen

At noon today there had been no further developments
in the search for a slightly built gunman of college age, who
entered over 20 rooms in three dormitories here, escaped
with approximately $350 plus a wristwatch and threatened
two students, who challenged him, with a gun.

In chapel this morning Dean
Bailey told the student body that
police were following up several
leads which they hoped would re-
sult in the apprehension of the
criminal,

He also reported that Mr. Ed
“Cop” Linker, campus policeman,
took the license number of a sus-
picious looking car parked near
the College Union early Thursday
morning, in which a young man,
apparently a student, was sleep-
ing.

After having taken the license
number, Mr. Linker checked the
Union to see if any foul play
-was afoot there, and when he re-
turned to the car, the man had
left.

The car was described as a late
model two-tone Oldsmobile, bear-
ing a Georgia license plate. In-
vestigation revealed that the car
was registered in the name of a
Mrs. Fields of Atlanta. Dean Bailey
asked if any student had any
knowledge of the car that would
clear it of suspicion that he report
it to him immediately. At present
police are scouring several states
in search of the automobile.

Gunmen Described

Several students who saw the
gunman said that they thought
they would be able to identify
him. Their descriptions of him
were similar, All agreed that he
wes about 20 or 21 years old,
slightly built, with a rather full
face and prominent jawbone. He
was wearing a brown checked coat
and a brown tie.

They also agreed that he was a

Entrance Examinations

To Be Required By 1955

Beginning with the fresh-
man class entering Davidson
in 1955-56, applicants for ad-
mission into Davidson must
take the Scholastic Aptitude
section of the College En-
trance Examination Board
tests. ;

This action, recently taken by
the Administration, requires that
all prospective students wishing to
enter Davidson must take this test
or one substituted by the college.
The main advantage of giving this
test to prospective students is that
of helping the Admissions Com-
mittee to select the boys fitted
for study at Davidson.

The college plans to use these
tests in two ways. First, to require
all applicants below a specific level
to be screened by the members
of the Admissions Committee, with
a final decision by that committee
being made on the basis of the
complete record of the prospective
student. No cut-off point for re-
jections is anticipated, as the
CEEB does not set a cut off score,
but leaves the matter up to the
judgment of the institution.

The second use of this test
would be in trying to eliminate
those students who would not be
able to do successful academic
work here.

Advantages in the plan to use
this test are six: improved judg-
ments by the Admissions Commit-
tee; removal of testing pressures

from orientation; listing in the
College Handbook (published by
the CEEB, not Davidson's); asso-
ciation with the better universi-
ties and colleges of the U. S.; re.
ceipt of techniques offered by
CEEB, and a source of strength in
resisting outside pressures to ac-
cepting unqualified students.

Disadvantages center around the
loss of some good prospective stu-
dents who would be unwilling to
take the tests, which costs six
dollars. Besides this there is a
cost to Davidson for the service,
and these tests are inadequate for
predicting academic success in col-
lege.

Almost all of the tests are of
the objective variety, utilizing
moultiple-choice answers. The com-
plete examination is administered
in two sessions of three and one-
half hours each. Verbal and
mathematical sections are given
in the morning, followed by a va-
riety of one hour tests in the aft-
ernoon.

These tests are given four times
annually at selected centers all
over the world. Here at Davidson
Professor Ostwalt is the key man
in giving tests of a similar type.

The college entrance tests will
not be used for the incoming fresh-
man this year. The tests are al-
ready being used extensively in
colleges throughout the United

States.
