Drop/add improved
but not perfected

By Jennifer Kerns

It’s six o’clock, one hour be-
fore the pandemonium starts, and
there is already a large crowd form-
ing in the Gallery. Students anx-
iously await an event that only
happens twice a year. The line
snakes in and out of all corners of
the first floorof Chambers. Voices

grow louder and more impatientas ~

the clock ticks toward7 p.m., when
the doors will open.

This is the drop/add of old. In
years past it has been a monster,
causing confusion even among
upperclassmen and mass frustra-
tion to many participants.

This year, however, the
Registrar’s Office updated its sys-
tem in response to requests from
the SGA’s Academic Affairs Coun-
cil and students.

However, students have mixed

feelings about the changes made.”

Sunday afternoon time slots were

given out for the evening drop/
add. Sophomore Kristen Rich-
ardson says, “For me, the time

cards gave me piece of mind. Last

year I waited in line all day to get
into aclass.” Some doubt the effi-
cacy of these time slots. “People

still got there early, so there was ©

still a line,”
Milligan.
The phone-in system received
both good and bad reviews as well.

she wanted 100- and 200-level
courses, which could not be picked

up over the phone. “Why can’t we

add these lower level courses as
well?” she asks. Some _ upper-
classmen fear that freshmen get
priority to these lower level classes.

Senior Daniela Welsh argues,
“Freshmen should be the last to
choose. Afterall, they have eight
semesterd of classes, while the
upperclassmen have less time to

fulfill requirements.”

The freshmen drop/add ran
exactly as it has in the past. Fresh-
man Ryan Lonatser calls it “cha-
otic," with "snaking long lines” all

through the first fioor.

While lines still remain, up-
perclassmen ‘agree that the hassle
was less than in years past. “The
lines were not as long, and every-

thing was less hectic,” comments
junior Alicia Dandar. Some, how-
ever, contend that getting the
classes one wants is still just a
matter of good luck.

Despite controversies, course guide

By Meg Wolff

After widespread concerns
that acourse evaluation guide could
cause a rift between students and
professors, the Davidson Course
Guide has been published and dis-
tributed. Editor-in-Chief Jamie
McConneltook a leading role in
producing the book and was
awarded a charter by SGA as well
as funding from the Activities Tax
Council. \
The course guide includes
numerical evaluations of courses
in six categories: the class overall,

the professor, the difficulty, the

: readings, the workload, and the

pace.
The book also lists class en-
rollment and reasons to enroll.
. Managing editor B.J. Rudell
‘and McConnel distributed one
course guide to each freshman,
sophomore and junior room. Due
to a short supply of guides, only
Resident Advisors have the books
in the senior apartments. Inter-
ested persons can also find three
course guides on reserve in the

library.

Some students, such as senior
Stephen Brackbill, disagree
strongly with the principle of the
guide: “It is really hard to get any
sort of valuable consensus on some-
thing so subjective.”

Despite skepticism and com-
plaints that such a course guide
would be too subjective, both
Rudell and McConnel claim to have
observed greater curiosity anden-
thusiasm about the guide. Ruddell
says, “people who were at first
against the guide are now using it.”
McConnel says complaints that the

book published for fall

course guide is too subjective are
unfounded because of the number
of aspects of acourse that are evalu-
ated.

Junior Brooke McRae says the
“reviews in the guide are accurate
and even helpful, but not enough
classes were reviewed.” Accord-
ing to McConnel, certain classes
that did not appear in the course
guide were left out because less

' than five people reviewed those

particular courses.
Both McConnel and Ruddell
hope that the project will grow.

Sophomore Katie Wheatley is glad
that the course guide was pub-
lished: “It is nice to have a guide
when you are picking courses, es-
pecially when you have no idea
who the professor is or how hard
the class is going to be.”
Freshman Colin Kelly agrees:
“The book is very informative for’
freshmen who have no prior knowl-
edge of classes. I personally have
used it to find out about the pace of
classes - ithas been most helpful to
me to find out how quickly a class

that, according to Rudell, “This
will not become another weight

Holland has located a distribu-

purpose surface for one year, free

within six hours.

After much debate, the SGA
tabled the resolution until Tuesday
so that senators would be able to
discuss the issue with their con-
stituents before voting. Rudell
says, “The current outdooi court is
anembarrassment. It was designed
for use at summer camps, not for
Davidson students.”

Several senators disagreed
with the resolution. Connor sena-

tor Jo Burrows says, “The main
reason I’m opposed is because bas-
ketball only caters to a small popu-
lation at Davidson. There is not
enough parking as it is, and it is
inconvenient to walk to Baker.
Why not use the money to reno-
vate Johnston Gym?”

Rudell says he is “kind of up-
set the issue was tabled, but I un-
derstand that people need to dis-
cuss it."

College to study
economic efficiency

By Court McBryde

Davidson College appointed
a task force in the spring of 1993 to
assess the efficiency of the col-
lege. The task force’s purposes are
to come up with more cost-effec-

* tive suggestions to better the col-
lege and to avoid any financial
turmoil in the future.

The Andrew W. Mellon Foun-
dation funded the establishment of
the task force with a $225,000
grant. Professor of Economics
Peter Hess heads this group with
the intent to continue first rate edu-

‘cation at an effective cost.

The task force has spent the
beginning of their three year charge
learning about the college by ex-
amining the budget and revenues
and conducting one-on-one inter-
views with college employees. “I
am impressed with the willingness
and cooperation of the staff to come
forward and discuss their views
with us,” Hess says. "Our ap-
proach is to geteveryone involved
and more conscious on ways to do
their jobs better.”

“The definition of efficiency
is doing more with less." Hess
says, "We haven’t hit an emer-
gency situation, but we might run
into real constraints in the future,

and we want to avoid that.”

He says the group wants to
instill a culture of communication
and for employees to understand
each others' responsibilities “to set
up quality circles.”

Hess explains that the group
not only examines cost-efficiency,
but ways to improve the quality of

_ life for the students. Fot example,

one of the ideas the task force
discussed was the establishment of
ashuttle service to Charlotte on the
weekends.

Hess welcomes students’
views, and the group plans to so-
licit their opinions on topics “‘such
as a solution for more study space
at night.”

The task force “illuminates the
problem,” Hess said. The sugges-
tions are then taken to the principle
executives of staff. The task force

_ has already recommended to the

Committee to have a more formal
evaluation for employees.

. Other members of the task
force include Professor of Chem-
istry Rodger Nutt, Tony Terry with
Physical Plant, Jane Price with the
Controller’s Office, ex officio Bob
Sutton, Richard Terry with Resi-

dence Life, and ex officio Robert

Williams.
