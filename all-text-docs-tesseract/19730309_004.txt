Amnesty

Amnests” What exactly does t! mean? For many
Americans it conjures up the treasonous thought that
those who tled their countrv in a time of crisis, when it
needed them. will be allowed to return home and be
accepted again as true Americans.

Though on the surface the maze of moral questions
involved seems to be most important. beneath this.
the present stand of.the Nixon Administration on am-
nestv appears to indieate more significant. covert and
grim realities of American thinking after Vietnam.

Why not give the conscientious objector amnesty?
After all, we seem willing to spend millions of dollars
to rebuild North Vietnam, once considered our mortal
foe. Why not then accept the moral decisions of our
own sons? For certainly they are not the enemy.

However, if we let young men run from the service
now, in the eyes of many, a dangerous precedent has
beensset. What will prevent them from doing it again
in the future?

But does this reference to ‘‘future’’ mean that
someday soon we will be involved in another Viet-
nam? No one will ever say this, but one’s stand on the
amnesty question undoubtedly seems to betray one's
expectations.

The Nixon Administration has stated to a relieved
America that it intends to be much more discriminate
in the future in terms of committing American men
and arms to fight in skirmishes far from our shores.
The move to an all-volunteer army indirectly for-
tifies this. If the army is all-volunteer. the President
will have to be careful} in how it is used, or no one will
enlist.

So. for all intents and purposes, the fate of the
fugitive is irrelevant to the American military of the
future. The fugitive is an outcropping of the draft.
supposedly a thing of the past. Paradoxically.
however. the government insists that the fugitive
question is still pertinent to the military.

What does this mean? At the very best. it reflects
only -a personal bias of the President. but his
vehement stand tends to imply grander stakes. If he
believed wholeheartedly in prudent future military
operations. amnesty would be nothing more than a
means of healing. But. the Nixon administration
demands justice.

No more wars? Perhaps: but if the intellectual
complexion of America and its government can augur
the future. don't count on it.

Third Class Mail

The problem of the financial stability of Davidson
. College has become of utmost concern to many
people. from administrators to faculty to students.

To remedy this. the Administration. particularly
those under Mr. Cornell's command. claim that they
are doing evervthing possible to alleviate the crisis.
Cuts have been made in many departments to keep
the budget in the black. Yet the college continues to do
little things that seem to us quite needless. which add
to the financial strain.

Take. for instance. a letter that all students received
dated February 27. 1973 from Cornell regarding fee
increases for next year. Those letters were sent by first
class mail at tne approximate cost of $80. Yet these
letters did not travel more than a nan 2 mile. the
distance {rom Chambers Building to the U. S. Post Of-
fice in Davidson.

Thus seems an absurdity to us, when these same let-

mn ‘een sent third class mail for about a

ters could have uv Lt
fourth of the cost. It migin mean tha ww ‘he ceive the

letter a day later, but with regaic “a
question, another day would not have matter.. | -ua

Taken bv itself, this might seem like a drop in tac
bucket as compared with this year's budget of some
six million dollars. However. when one takes into con-
sideration all the mail that the college sends to
students, this could turn out to be a pretty significant
sum of money.

Savings in this area could conceivably run into
thousands of dollars, if the college would limit the
mail they sent to essential items, sent third class.

In July late I was led by the
nose under one Carla to Rici's. I
had figured by now she was
along for the meal and was
ready to make a getaway.

Then in the doorway I saw my
old friend from class.

She was called D. and came
over to sit until dinner. Her
boyfriend came along and we
had a nice foursome except |
wished it was a threesome.
*‘Miles,”’ she ays, ‘‘this is Barry
Parkhill."

I suppose somewhere in the
gap that followed my name was
given away with Carla's while |
sat looking. But I don’t remem-

Barry is no less a legend in
Virginia than Lee or Jackson or
Richbrau beer, but Jesus here

he was.

Allport called him the best
guard in the nation and he was
most valuable in the ACC. I
mean a basketball player. the

Humanities Program Blasted,

Untortunately, many students

Anyone who resperts ne ef-

that in the face of an oversupply
of professors in the market
must result a falling price for
professorial services.
