: Aristotle's

Ha! | bet you didn’t expect to see my by-line on
the sports pages of THE DAVIDSONIAN. However,
consistent with my policy of extending tentacles into
all areas of Davidson life, ole’ Aristotle has infiltrated
sports, too. .

As this is written Tuesday I don’t know the South
Carolina-score, naturally, but at least we played at
home. For this year’s team playing at home has been a
definite advantage, as they have lost five on the road
in eight'tries and the three wins have been over
toughies ECU, VMI and Georgia.

wae a win over West Virginia in Charlotte
and a loss in Morgantown, a win over a_ strong St.
John’s team and choking in the final minutes. against
Pittsburgh, or coming close to Wake Forest while
getting blown. out of the Princeton gym.

Steve Kirley, on the other hand, has at least had
better statistics in away games (for instance, 21 points
against WVU up there and nothing like that in Char-
lotte). For this sort of inconsistent offensive>perform-
ance, Steve wins the Rodney Knowles Award for Best
Play When There’ Are No Students There to Watch. |

On the other hand, neither Kirley nor anyone
else on the team will win the Rodney Knowles Award
for Awful Defense (this goes to the freshmen as a
team). The defense has been tremendous all season,
with a lapse against Brian Taylor at Princeton, but
like everything else has been toughest at home.

. Of course, this tendency to be weak away from
home is unlikely to hurt us Saturday against the Rich-
mond Plumbers, who managed to provide VMI with
its first win Monday.

Before the season I figured the Wildcats would
be good for 20 wins this year, too, but of course the
eed to Eric Minkin and Brian Adrian shot that

own.

One disappointment | have felt this season has
been the general absence from the floor of Lester
Strong. Lester plays defense ds well as anyone else
on the team, rebounds well and can shoot from out-
side, but he just doesn’t fit in Coach Holand’s of-
fense.

Lester is basically a run-and-gunner; from the
Stacked post he is too short, and from the wing he
gets neither room nor permission to go the one-on-
one route which he could follow. =

It is unfortunate that as soon as we graduated
the players Strong might have replaced, we also grad-
uated the only style of offense that suits his parti-
cular abilities. \

_ For these reasons Lester wins the Rocky Cross-
white On-the-Bench ‘Award, and I win the Rocky
Crosswhite Ignorant Sportswriter’s Award.

Interest Created
Around Fencing

By ERINE SHIPE

sor Hiram Walker has been
helping this group.

Walker, he explained, is
the school's expert on the
sport and would be ideal to
coach such a squad. Walker
competed at the varsity
level at Princeton and coach-
ed Duke University’s team.

Student incerest has been
a driving force in creating
interest group clubs which
later developed at Davidson
into varsity teams.

The soccer and_ sailing
teains are two examples and

now &ecording to Sterling
Martin there is a growing
interest in fencing.

Three years ago (Martin
began offering fencing class-
-es as part of the physical
education program and now
student ‘interest has been
wretted enough that there is
growing talk of creating a
fencing club.

‘Fencing is an ideal sport
for a student at Davidson,
for it has great carry over
value,”: (Martin. said.

‘I’m teaching four classes
of fencing each year and
now we have a group of stu-
dents working out individual-
ly in the afternoon from
‘which this interest is | grow-
ing,’’ he added.

(Martirf’said he hasn't had

time to work with the after-,

noon ‘group but that Profes-

Professor Francis Ghigo is
another experienced fencer
who could help in the pro-
gram.

‘Fencing is a’ sport that

gets into your blood,’’ Mar-
tin said. “If the interest
that has been created here
lasts for two or three years
there is a good chance a
club could be financed and
start to compete.”

Martin explained that fin-
ances would be a major dif-

‘ficulty in fielding a club.

If a team could be form-
ed there are several schools
in the area which would pro-
vide. ' competition. North
Carolina, Duke, and The Ci-
tadel are among the many
area schools’ who have clubs
although it is not a recogni-
zed intercollegiate sport,

Ray Swetenourg and Tom
Richardson made particular-
ly fine showings as the in-
door track season opened
last weekend with the VMI
relays, according to David
son track coach Heath Whit
tle.

Fourty-one colleges and
universities were represent:
ed at the relays, among
them Tennessee, Georgia,
and all the ACC schools ex-
cept Duke. Over seventy
contestants were registered
in each event.

Whittle took only five men
to the meet, but Swetenburg
placed fifth in the 60 yard
high hurdles and Richard-
son sixth in ‘the 60 yard
dash.

Swetenburg, a junior from
Gainesville, Ga, ran a 7.3
in the hurdles for a new
Davidson record. He said he
felt extremely good before
and during the meet, and
hopes to improve on this ini
tial performance.

‘He also commented — that
Whittle ,is looking for him
to break his record of 14.6
in the 120 yard high hurdles.

Richardson, another junior
from Roanoke, stated that he
was ‘‘particularly encourag-
ed by his performance.’’ He
said that he had run 6.3 a
couple of times before but
never so early in the year.

Both admitted that the
performance could be a re-
sult of their having started
workouts early this year.
Coach Whittle has had-~ sev-
eral members working out
regularly since Octoher.

Other members of © the
team who participated but
did not place were Howard
Boyd in the 2 mile, Steve

Shankweiler in the shot and

Tom. Rogers in the broad
jump. .-

However Coach Whittle
said he was ‘‘well pleased
they did as well as they
did."

Boyd ran his fastest ever
in the 2 mile.

‘Whittle said this years
team should give the best

performance of any David:
son team ever in the con-
ference meet.

He ‘expects a fourth place
finish behind William. and
Mary, Furman, and ECU.
The one place he did men

tion where the ‘Cats may
suffer is the 440.

There are still two indoor
meets left, the Big 7 meet
at Chapel Hill and The con
ference » championships — at.
VMI.
