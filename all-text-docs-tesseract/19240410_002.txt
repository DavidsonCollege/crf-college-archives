LAKE AND PATTON: ELECTED
ASSISTANT TRACK MAN-
AGERS

At the election held last week for as-
sistant track manager the two highest
men were Al Lake and J. H. Patton.
Heretofore the track team has not offer-
ed letters to a manager, the manager be-
ing selected from the members of the
team. This year, however, it has been
decided to select a man from the stu-
dent body to manage the team and work
for a letter just as they do in the other
major sports. :

Next year the man elected will be al-
lowed to take any one trip that he wishes
to take and will be awarded a letter.
This is one step that is being taken that
shows that the track team is coming to
the front and ranking in its importance
with the football, baseball and other
teams that are considered in the leading

places in college athletics.

Columbia Freshmen were publicly

judges. Those who knew their songs re-

know them received a dose of shoe black-

Horsehides and hickories seem to hold
sway these days, so we'll get the baseball
up-sets and set-ups off our chest before
we start the general dope on who’s who
in spring’s other sports.

Up-set number one was Guilford’s 8
to 4 win over the mightier Wake Forest
aggregation, and we would like to men-
tion that Wake Forest is rated a good
team this year in.as much as Guilford is
due all the credit for a timely win.

Set-up number one scems to have been
South Carolina for Lenoir. They’ve got
South Carolina for Lenoir, Again they
down their opposition 4 to 0, and its hats
off to Lenoir. They’ve got a fast and
smooth working outfit and bid fair to
rack up a good record this season,

It’s good to see Sion Alford back on
the job at short after a minor illness.
And speaking of Alfords reminds us,
Frank still remains alone in the home
run class. How about a few others step-
ping up to give him a “run” for his
money. That's one way of improving the
game.

Morris, of Carolina, did the grand stand
act last week in account for half of
Carolina’s 8 to o victory over Guilford
by closing out a homer with the bases
drunk, :

Davidson’s real test comes this week-
end in four games in a row, three in her
own back yard and a return game with
Wake Forest in Wake Forest territory.
Tt will be a hard row but you can’t tell
when that Wildcat spirit will produce re-
sults. We don’t predict.

Hippo Houck begs pardon to announce
that he is now operating a Woolworth
Wrestling School, with nothing over ten
cents for a lesson. Special attention to
cauliflower cultivation.

Things are happening pretty lively in
track circles. V. P. I. has taken David-
son into camp only to be beaten out by
State and thus lower Davidson’s pros-
pects for state honors,

Red Anderson has stepped into the
limelight as second honor man in the
opening meet, and Gracey continues his
one man track team stunt with a num-
ber of points in as many events. North
Carolina has taken Clemson into camp,
and shut out Clemson’s ace dash man,
allowing Mr. Chandler only second place
in the 220 and not a berth in the century
dash. And plans have been changed to
convert the Clemson dual meet into a
triangular meet with Clemson, Furman
and Davidson entered.

Old Kid Jupiter Pluvius has played
havoc with sporting activities on the
hill during the past week—raining out
the Elon game, the Seminary tennis
match and suspending further activities
in the golf tournament. Prospects look-
ed better than the weather to us though,
and we believe it would have been bet-
ter had the weather not intervened.

Lenoir Whips Wildcats
In Hard Fought Game

Younger’s Men Fail to Hit When
Hits Meant Runs”

Coach Monk’s nine went down fighting
before Lenoir’s fast baseball team April
2nd, on Richardson field by a score of
4-0. Lenoir’s timely hitting, coupled with
the Wildcat’s untimely errors accounted
for Lenoir’s runs, while the Wildcats
failed to find Philip’s benders, getting but
six hits with no two in the same inning.

Lenoir started the fireworks with two
tallies in the third. Whisonhunt doubled
to left; he advanced to third on Gres-
ham’s single, but was caught between
third and home, Kelly Johnson running
him down, Laird let the next man by
and then an error and a sacrifice fly
brought two men across the plate.

In the seventh Boggs rang up another
tally for the Hickory nine. An error won
the first sack, two sacrifices carried him
to third, and a single by Deaton brought
him home. R. Clemmer made the last
counter in the eighth frame. A single,
an error, and Hawn’s Texas leaguer did
the work,

Harry Vance’s fielding featured the
home team’s defense. He made a shoe-
string catch in the third that brought
the crowd to their feet. Again in the
seventh he pulled down a_ sky-liner.
Harry turned his ankle on this catch and
was forced to leave rightfield to Lucien
Wells.

State Is Favorite In

Meet With Davidson

Techmen Whip V. P. I. Team Which
Won Decision Over Wildcats
Last Week

With their 1924 escutcheon emblazoned
with a cleancut victory over V. P. I. at
Raleigh Saturday, the N. C. State team
will enter the first intra-state track and
field meet of the year and are doped to
win over the Davidson athletes by a
good margin. In the initial fray here
last Thursday the Virginia Techmen con-
sistently ran their way to a 76 1-2 to
49 1-2 win over the Red and Black ag-
gregation but two days later the invaders
fell before State’s great superiority in
the weight events, losing by a 71-55
score.

Despite the fact that the Virginians
won only four out of 14 first places, the
contest was close and when the last
event was called, they had a chance to
tie the Engineers by winning all three
places in the javelin throw. They failed
to do this, their only strength being in
the middle distance races and the high
jump.

The State outfit is especially strong in
the weights, being captained by Hamrick,
holder of the North Carolina inter-col-
legiate record for the shot put. He is
supported by Crater. Byrum, winner of
both 1oo and 220 yard dashes ran them
under the time of the Davidsop-V. P. I.
meet, but Clark, who hurdled his way to
two first places, made the same time as
Gracey on the highs.

With Koenig back with the Wildcats
for the dashes, with Gracey going good,
with Anderson and Williford showing up
nicely in their first match, and with the
two teams well matched in the other
events, Coach Ellis’ men are out to get
revenge for the 88-38 defeat which State

served last year in a drizzling rain at Ra-
leigh.
