“MILITARY GIRLS”
COMING ATTRACTION.

Next Friday night the third number
of the Lyceum Course will be given in
Shearer Hall. The attraction will be the
“Military Girls,” consisting of six at-
tractive girls, who appear as a drum
corps and orchestra. In the drum corps
they give selections from many old mili-
tary and patriotic airs. As an orchestra
they render their selections from the
songs that evervone knows and that ap-
peal to all. There is one reader in the
company, and most of the girls are indi-
vidual soloists.

Tt was announced: in Ttte Davinson-
WAN that the Lyceum Course had been
discontinued, but by special effort on the
part of the management this number and
the one given last week were secured.
As to whether there will be any further
attractions after Friday night, all de-
pends upon the backing given to it by
the student body and town. he fu-
ture Lyceum Courses at Davidson de-
pend upon whether a success can be
made of it this year or not. . There is
no reason why a success can not be made
of it this vear if the student body will
back up the management by attending
the attractions.

verv good crowd was present at
the number given last week, and it is
hoped that_as many and more, too, will
be present Friday night.

The “Military Girls” is a high priced
entertainment and will be given at Dav-
idson at a reduced price. If every one
will come out some more good numbers
are assured in the future.

DR. MARTIN ATTENDS
OGLETHORPE EXERCISES

Dr. Martin has returned from a trip
to Atlanta, where he, as Moderator of
the General Asembly, presided at the
exercises which were held in connection
‘with the laying of the cornerstone of the
new Oglethorpe University. The exer-
cises, which were held in the North Ave-
nue Presbyterian church, included ad-
dresses by Dr. Jas. 1. Vance, of Nash-
ville, Tenn., and Dr. Green, of Dan-
ville, Ky. After the conclusion of the

rogram ‘luncheon was served by the

adies of the church. A large pariy of
those present then went by automobile
to the site of the University, where the
formal laying of the cornerstone took
lace. - That evening a banquet for the
oard of trustees and their friends was
given at the Winecoff Hotel.

While in Atlanta Dr. Martin met
with the Georgia Association of the Dav-
idson alumni at one of their monthly
meetings and lunches at the Hotel Ans-
ley. large number of alumni were
present and an interestng and enthusi-
astic meeting was held, during which
the association pledged its support to the
- movement now being perfected for the
upbuilding of Davidson.

The 23rd and 24th were spent by Dr.
Martin at Athens, Ga., with Dr. Row-
land, chairman of the Laymen's Conven-
tion, with whom he discussed plans for
the convention and for the attendance
of the Davidson student body at its
meetings.

Returning, Dr. Martin stopped aver] sail for the home stretch.

in Charlotte to attend a meeting of Lav-
idson alumni there, at which plans for

the proposed improvements at Davidson] tract with the Minneapolis club of the

were discussed.

SOPHS 6, FRESH o.

In a game in which both teams evinc-
ed to a high degrre that fighting, tenac-
ious, unconquerable spirit, so character-
istic of all inter-class games, the Sophs,
on Tuesday afternoon, January 26, were
the victors over the Fresh by a narrow
but well earned 6 to oO score.

During the first half neither team
could claim any marked advantage or
make consistent gains when gains would
count for a touchdown. The Fresh line,
lighter perhaps than that of their gop-
ponents, held like adamant against the
repeated line bucks of the Soph back
field. Around the Fresh ends, however,
a weakness was soon revealed and Mc-
Kinnon and Porter made several bril-
liant gains by short and long end runs.
But all such gains Ives and Crouch for
the Fresh counterbalanced by a_ like
strategy. Neither goal was in imminent
anger of being crossed during the first
alf.

Soon after the beginning of the sec-
ond half the Soph tactics of short and
lang end runs and occasional line plays,
aided by good interference,. began to
show perceptible gains; and the ball, at
the end of the third quarter, had been
carred to the Fresh two-yard line. One
play, a short right end run by Porter, at
the beginning of the fourth quarter,
brought to the Sophs their only touch-
down of the game. A try at goal failed.
In the last few minutes of play Ives,
eluding the Soph back field, made a
beautiful broken field run of — thirty

yards. The line-up of the two teams
was as follows:

ANNUAL WORK
BEING RUSHED.

Practically all of the individual pic-
tures for the Annual have come in and
shipments are being made ,to the en-
pravers every two or three days. The
last of the group pictures have come in,
too. The art staff is being rushed to get
all of the drawings on time, while the
editor hopes to send the first installment
of the printed matter to the printers
some time this week. He is said to be
unable to think of anything except
Quips and Cranks now. It is simply a
matter of getting the work into the
hands of the printers and the engravers
in time now, and all hands are crowding
