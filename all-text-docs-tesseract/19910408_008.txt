EMPOWERMENT --- And A New-Found Hope

By John Patton

On my way back from break in
Boston, I was reading The Econo-
mist (trying to get back in the right
frame of mind) when! first noticed
the amazingly clear view of the
landscape. I had never seen New
York City, Washington or Phila-
delphiaso clearly from anairplane.
The view was striking as were
several prominent dichotomies
disguised on the ground in the
sprawl and bustle of these cities.

It appears from the air that all
three are almost perfectly ordered.
That order, which from living in
Boston I don’t associate with the
city, is actually comforting in that
itimplies simple logic and organi-
zation which are not so apparent at
the street level. However, the real-
ity on the streets of Boston, (and I
would guess New York and the
other cities), is far from comfort-
ing.

The other dichotomy occurs
most prominently in New York
andcan be seen from the groundas
well as from the air with equal
clarity. It is the vast difference
between uptown New York and

* the Jersey shoreline of the Hudson
and other parts of New York City
itself. The indigence of Fort Lee
and Newark as well as parts of the
Bronx and Harlem starkly con-
trasts with the enormous affluence
of uptown. It is a glaring indict-
ment at this half century’s failure
of attempts at social reform.

What does this mean? Well, it
appears that we stand at a cross-
roads in domestic welfare policy.
The relative failure of past policies
and the recenteconomic downturn
have brought many social issues
back to the forefront. Direction
and conviction are needed -- but
from where? Empowerment
coupled with (1) an even distribu-

tion of tax dollars across city, (2)
racial and ethnic lines, (3) lasting
enterprize zones, and (4) arenewed
emphasis on city-wide equality in
the public education system would
be a strong beginning.

What is empowerment? It
means changing the underclasses
in our cities from people who
depend on welfare to people who
depend on themselves. It means

gram’s added fiscal burden would
not only be alleviated, but (2)
when money would be saved.
Improved education in the ghettos
is the key to such a long-term re-
covery.

American cities must have
equitable educational systems. All
those educational opportunities that
are open to white suburban kids,
including extracurricular activities

What is empowerment? It means changing the
underclasses in our cities from people who depend
on welfare to people who depend on themselves.

tenant-managed and eventually
owned housing projects. It means
low-interest or interest-free loans
to qualified home buyers. Itmeans
a restructured welfare system
where recipients are threatened
with a cut-off of payments unless
they find work, thereby giving them
the impetus to find work. It means
guaranteed day care for single
mothers if they can overcome the
lure of welfare’s pervasive secu-
rity. It means federal monies for
good job training programs so that
these same recipients and mothers
are not abandoned but trained, so
they can find these jobs. It means
more tax credits for those earning
below a certain level of income,
say $15,000. It means empower-
ing inner city youth to become
successful, independent members
of society instead of providing them
with welfare’s shelter from reality
and responsibility.

Can empowerment do this
alone? Clearly not. In fact a pro-
gram like this wouldn’teven make
it out of committee in Congress
without clauses detailing (1) a
foreseeable time when the pro-

like sports, need to be opened to

blacks and other minorities as well.
How?

The way to start is to redistrib-
ute tax dollars so that each com-
munity ina particular state receives
proportionately the same amount
of capital per student with which to
work. This would help alleviate
problems like those in Washington
D.C. where the schools in the North
west part of the city are sound but
dismal in the South. In factin 1989
almost “four times as many black
men were jailed in the district’s
prisons as graduated from its pub-
lic schools,” and thatin acity where
Blacks comprise well over half of
the population.*

Anequitable distribution of tax
dollars for the schools and for col-
legiate scholarships would be a
start to keeping kids in school rather
than on the streets -- or in prison.

Another component of a po-
tentially successful program is
enterprise zones. Enterprise zones
are areas where businesses are
granted tax breaks if they establish
a branch within that zone, thereby
creating new jobs. They area great

way to bring jobs to the ghettos and
create an atmosphere to which the
students who received the college
scholarships would want toretum.
Their return would bring not only
educated and more wealthy people
to these regions, but would show
the young people that there is an
alternative to selling drugs.

The problem has been, how-
ever, that the tax breaks: are so
temporary and small that either
businesses do not take advantage
of them or are not willing to relo-
cate permanently into the depressed
areas. In light of that, what is
needed is both lasting ante.
tial tax breaks to make the move
into the ghettosa financially sound
one for big business.

From living in Massachusetts,
I have scen the effects of an
enormous, all-encompassing and
often unquestioning welfare sys-
tem, the weight and irresponsibil-
ity of which have led to, among
other things, the worst bond rating
on Wall Street of any state in the
country and a two billion dollar
deficit -- and consequently less
money foreveryone. Philadelphia
is another example where city
government burdened by both
expanding welfare payments and
cuts in federal funds is not only
strapped for cash, but in this case,
is onthe verge of bankruptcy which
could mean almost no money for
anyone. -

These issues are not explosive
like the Gulf War, and they are not
as visible as elections, but more
and more they are eating away at
the very social fabric of this coun-
try. Consider these statistics: in
1988 62.2% of all black babies
were born to unmarried women
(compared with 16.7% of white
babies)’; in 1987 the infant mor-
tality rate was 18 black babies per

1000 (compared with 7.9 per 1000
white babies’; last year’s unem-
ployment rate among Blacks was
10.5% almost twice thatof whites*;
the average black student is more
likely to go to prison than univer-
sity*; in 1985 24.5% of Whites and
40.2% of Blacks had had less than
twelve years of education’; and
finally, on a different plain, the
failing welfare system has tripled
in cost since 1965 -- (these figures
are calculated by the value of the
dollar in 1988) from $141 billion
in 1965 to $520 billion in 1987,
with no apparent improvement in
the situation in our Cities *.
Allof these statisticscan proba-
bly be at least partially explained
away; but what is clear to anyone
who just looks around even in
Davidson on the way to I-77, is
that this country is seeing a grow-
ing disparity in wealth. Clearly,
the old system is flawed, and the
more we delay as a nation to form
a comprehensive policy to. deal
with this disparity, the harder. it
will be to change it. Despite some
of his failings, Lyndon B. Johnson
said it well in 1965,
“If we stand passively by while the
center of each city becomes a hive
of deprivation, crime and hope-
lessness. . . if we become two
people, the suburban affluent and
the urban poor, each filled with
mistrust and fear for the other. . .
then we shall cripple each genera- ©
tion to come.””* ;
Time is moving and so must we.

any other marked passages or
quotations were taken from either
staff written articles (pgs 11,17) in

McLaughlin and Kinner being
Saddam Hussein, and Mr HP being
his propagandists.

I would now like to turn to an
issue of more relevance for me as
an Arab. Ihave been distressed by
the increasingly belligerent stand
the American public has taken
towards the Arab people.

I did not realize how serious of
an issue it had become until only
recently when a friend’sconfusion
allowed me to put things into per-
spective. She said, “I saw and
heard about so many Muslims
around the world rallying behind
Saddam Hussein. I don’t under-
stand! How can a true Muslim
believe Hussein is areligious man?
‘How can such an unholy person
lead a holy war?”

It became clear to me that her
view was the result of the propa-
ganda that the media and govern-
ment have been conveying to you.
It certainly has not been so. black
and white here in Italy. Maybe that
is because the people can see
through it.

It’s sad that even you students
of the liberal arts have failed to see
through the efforts of a group of
Ivy League clones in the White

House. Their propaganda has

succeeded in making you forget
that this war is about oil and in
convincing you that this is a war to
stem the rising tide of Muslim
fanaticism which supports Saddam
Hussein.

This issue, however, is more
complicated than the obvious
Machiavellian strategy of Saddam
Hussein to use religion as ameans
of mobilizing the masses behind
him. Whatis happening is that the
Arab people, frustrated with a
world order which has kept them
politically, economically, and,
mostimportantly, psychologically
inferior are saying, “We’ve had
enough.” A condition which very
few of you know anything about.
Acondition which is the result ofa
history of colonialism and neo-
colonialism which made and main-
tains your wealth and standard of
living in the west while the Arabs
continue to live in poverty and
destitution in the third world. —

If you truly understood how a
person in the third world feltknow-
ing that he/she and his/her land are
the sources of your wealth, you
would not be giving this war'a
chance. Moreover, you would see
through the outlandish justifica-
tions for this war. ButI guess what
Iam asking you todo isto putaside

that complacency which all of us
feel in that great haven, Davidson
College, and try to understand why
people are reacting the way they
are.

In short, I do not by any means
support Saddam Hussein. How-
ever, I support and sympathize
with the millions of Arabs who are
manifesting their anger at the in-
justice in this world. Now, itseems,
things will only get worse. Once
again, the world has slammed the
door in their face.

So don’t fall into the simplistic
view which our government has
chosen to present in justifying its
military presence in the Gulf. Not
all Arabs are Muslims and not all
Muslims are “fanatics’(whatever
that means). And if it makes a
difference, there are a good num-

-ber of Arabs who are-Christians.

Together, these people are sick of
trying to get through to you ina
less vociferous manner because
you haven’t been listening. If Is-
lam gives them the dignity and
courage to stand up and fight the
vile injustice which they face ev-
ery day, thenall the power to them.

chided, “You are such a little wuss
sometimes. Why don’t you just
ditch school and come anyway?”

place. Wars rage, Europe...uh.

Davidson administrators (job pos-
sessors!), we do NOT need grand-
mother’s encouraging truancy.

Come holiday season, Simple
Living practically entails gorging
with Grandmother. This travelling
on Easter Sunday bit has got to go.
Don’t you see? Are you not Hip?
Thathurry-up, high-paced lifestyle
of our heartless past has passed.
So get with it! Pamper us. We
have some shirking to do.

In closing: Hey administra-
tors, y'all are goobers. So take that
(my tongue is out), and that (dex-
terous fingers speak), and that (you
don’t want to know). Family val-
ues are at stake.

Women

traditonal gender roles,and these-
roles place women ina position of
dependence on both a social and fi-
nancial level. Women must enter
the public sphere and establish
themselves as social and financial
beings based on their own merit.
Only when women are freed from
dependency will they be viewed as

men’s equals.

You might. ask: “What about
the children?” The work place
must begin providing child care
services, and all other forms of
domestic Jabor must be: shared
equally by men and women. Lib-
eration from dependency willcome
only when men and women work,
side by side, in both the public and
domestic spheres.
