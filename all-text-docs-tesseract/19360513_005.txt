Junior Officers Initiated

\ Into Scabb

Lads Appear on Campus at S
A. M., Draped in Fantastic
Uniforms

HAVE BROOMSTICK GUNS

Impressive Drill Is Staged
Near Church

“What fine new ROTC uni-
forms!” “Who were those men
who marched by here this
morning? Marines?”

Questions and remarks such as
these filled the air on the morning
of Thursday, May 7. jBut such sur-
mises were wrong: Scabbard and
Blade was mercly holding its in-
formal initiation for the members
of the rising senior class just bid
to the society.

At 5:00 o'clock A. M., the poor
lads had to arise and to appear in
full uniform for drill, The uni-
form was most fantastic, blue denim
coats and pants, with olive drab
roll-leggings, topped off with brick-
filled knapsacks. Soldiers of this
caliber deserved superior weapons,
which they had in the form of
broomsticks. .

In chapel the initiates were forced
to make original announcements,
many of which took the form of re-

{ marks directed against Cokcy Bran-
ton, master—of-ceremonies for the
day. This worthy person retaliated
ewith a command for squad open-
order drill immediately after lunch,
near the church. .
As a result, the ears of students,
returning from the post office or
from their boarding houses were
greeted by cries of “Hit it! Ad-
vance! Hit it!" and their eyes beheld
strange visions of blue-draped fig-
ures, flinging themselves upon the
earth, only to rise and trudge for-
warda few more steps. All this the
rospective members underwent
while carrying a load of bricks
tipon their backs.
; The final humiliation of the oc-
. casion was the watch kept by the
1 new men until midnight. Then, and
then only, they threw those bricks
from their backs, broke in twain
their broom-stick rifles, and slipped
off those cursed jeans,
You sce, it takes the “stuff” to
join “this man’s army!”

CLASSES HOLD
JUNIOR-SENIOR

High School Banquet Given in
Chambers; Edward Jackson
Presides

The annual Junior-Senior banquet
of the Davidson High School was
held Friday night, May 8 in the
banquet Qall of Chambers Autli-
torium,

Edward Jackson, of the junior
class, was master of ceremonies, and
Kenneth Foreman, toastmaster.

The welcome speech was made by
Shirley Parker, president of the
junior class. Immediately follow-
ing came a toast to the seniors by
Kenneth Foreman. Cyrus Colvin,
president of the senior class re-
sponded to this.

To add variety. the waitresses
gave a stunt between toasts. Several
songs were also sung.

Virginia Isenhour then made a
toast to the teachers, and Miss
Mary Richards responded.

The dinner: followed these short

speeches, and during it;-the sen- |-

iors were further entertained. Inez
Sherrill, of the junior class, read
the class prophecy. This was fol-
lowed by games which were ar-
ranged by Julia Hobbs and Stella
Johnston. oo

One of the features of the pro-
gram was a piano team of Bill Mc-
Ilwinen and Frank Tucker from
the College. They played “Tiger
Rag,” “O Davidson,” and other se-
lections:

Mrs- Gaffney had charge of the
banquet and was assisted by Mrs.

CRIBBING GROUP
ORGANIZED AT OHIO

Unite to Discover Ways and
Means of Baffling Unwary

Proctors
—

Columbus, Ohio.—(ACPJ— The
hand that never rocked a cradle
may nevertheless be an old hand at
the crib.

Not to he outdone in the mad
race of. American undergraduates
to organize, Ohio State students
have formed the University Society
for the Promulgation of Cribbing
(unrecognized, so far, by the Dean's
Committee on Student Affairs) and
their researches have brought to
light many esoteric and devious
ways of confounding the unwary
proctor,

The commoner methods, such as
coff-writing, are frowned. upon by
the USPC, which interested rather
in investigation like that done by
a NYU researcher who discovered
that crib notes could be written
with grapefruit juice on glasses or
watch: dials.

Another favored method is known
as “the scroll.” The despairing stu-
dent makes his notes ona long strip
of paper, which he attaches to two
match sticks and rolls up into a
scroll. Use of this device. as in the
case of the co-ed’s bandkerchicf
system. calls for some knowledge
of histrionies,- since a. certain
amount of hand - wringing is tndi-
cated, while peering at the notes. °

The “pedal transfer" is recom-
mended in case where a pal needs
aid. A note is prepared, and one
foot-is-pliced—zpon one's knee. The
note ~is then slipped into the shoe
and the whole device, leg; foot, shoe
and note, placed close to the drown-
ing man, who drops a pencil nearby
and extracts the life-saver,

There are other ways of con-
fusing the instructor. the society re-
ports, citing the case of a member
who had been annoyed by an over-
ly suspicious proctor. The examina-
tion fell on the first of April, -and
the game was therciore legitimate.
Noticing the’ student's repeated
glances at a large watel, the in-
structor demanded to see it. Writ-
ten on the dial were the words:
“April Fool?

-[—Batfled, the instructor -retreated,

and the student immediately re-
sumed his long looks at the watch.
The,canny proctor decided that this
was a part of the strategy, and came
back for a second inspection. This
time the slogan ‘Fooled
Again.’

But a-University of Wisconsin
student did this better a year or so
ago._-A_certain instructor-had ac-
cused him of cheating throughout
the semester. Came the day of the
final. and retribution. The exam ivas

Professor Porter gave a few jin-

do in affecting the clothes, oceupa-

tribes observed.

Central Asia, Northern Sweden,
and parts of Africa are spats in
which nomads are prevalent. Amer-
jen has never hada nomad people
in its isolated arcas due to the lack
of domestic animals. The tespomse
to particular conditions is the rea-
