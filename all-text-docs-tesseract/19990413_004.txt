Information Technology Services (ITS) will
soon be changing the email service for both faculty
and students from Pollux to anew, more up-to-date
system — Microsoft Exchange and Outlook.

Director of Computing Support Lydia
Lorenzin said that the Pollux server, which cur-
rently serves all faculty and students, is a number
of years old. Given the choice of whether to
replace Pollux or renew some costly parts of it, the
ITS was influ-

person’s first name and his or her entire last name.

The changes will take place soon.’ All stu-

desired, students or faculty can switch now. The
ITS has already held demonstrations to help ac-
quaint its new users, and it will hold more if
needed. Students, faculty, and the administration
can request to be switched to the new system by
emailing the help desk at helpdesk @ davidson.edu.
Information about how to use Microsoft Outlook

The new President forthe

Stoops, and the senior

lier and Whitney Frazier. »
The new President forthe

and Jehan Shamsid-
Deen. The new President

Legerton. New Honor
Council Members were

Ksenija Milutinovic are

2001. The new Honor ;
Council Members for the class of 2002 are Carrie
Frazier, Aditi Sethi, and Mary Kat White.

Randy Skattum ‘01, the inde-

pendent Sena-
tor, and Matt
West °01 ran
the elections.
This year, one
of their main
‘objectives was
to encourage a
large voter
turnout. They
put up 350
posters around
campus and
sent out voice
mails and e-
mails to en-
courage stu-
dents to vote.
Skattum
thanked every- |
one who helped
organize the
elections, say-
ing, “Without
you guys, we
wouldn’t have
actually had
elections.”
Despite the efforts to encourage
voting, only 42.9% of the student

class of ’00 during ’99-00.

body participated in the elections. In the general
election the rising sophomore class boasted the
highest voter turnout with 50.9% of the class
voting. They were followed by. the rising juniors,
40.6 % of whom voted. In the rising senior class,
35.9 % of ‘the class
voted. About half of
the students who
participated in elec-
tions voted in cham-
bers, accounting for
51.3% of the vote,
and the rest of the
vote, 48.7%, oc-
curred in the Com-
mons. Skattum ex-
plained that there
could be several rea-
sons for the low
voter turnout. With
no campus-wide of-
fices at stake, some
students may have
considered these
elections to be less
significant. Also,
because the large
majority of candi-
dates were for Honor
Council, they were
unable to campaign,
which may have re-
sulted in a lower level of student awareness of the
elections on campus. Long lines for voting may
have been another factor that affected the student
participation in the
elections.

After the elections,
the new Presidents of-
fered suggestions to
encourage more vot-
ing. Monica Martinez
suggested that the du-
ration of the campaign
period should be a
week rather than a
weekend. According
toSGA by-laws, how-
ever, the dates for
elections are set. Julie
Chevalier suggested
that the time period
for the campaign
should be extended.
In order: to initiate
such an extension, an
amendment would
have to be made to the
SGA by-laws. Jehan
Shamsid-Deen of-
fered an alternative
solution to the low
voter turnout, sug-
gesting that students who work the election tables
be more “pro-active” by soliciting students to
vote. ‘
