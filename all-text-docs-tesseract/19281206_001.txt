DAVIDSON’S FIGHT UN-
DAUNTED

Too much Duke Reserve Spells
Defeat for Red and Black in
Final Encounter

(The Charlotte Observer) :

Duke easily hurled the final barrier
along the torturous path that leads to
a clash with North Carolina for the
state football crown by a 33 to 0 rout
of Davidson in Durham November 20.

Old Man Dope had his inning, but
the slightly lop-sided count neverthe-
less proved a surprise and leaves out
of the picture the valiant struggle that
a vastly more inexperienced and light-

er Davidson squad staged with the
odds heavily gainst them from the
outset.
Dazzling Attack
Duke, confident of its prowess,

launched a dazzling offensive from the
start. It seized an unrivalled chance
to eliminate its sole remaining foe be-
fore accepting probably the most
glamorous pigskin opportunity its
history, a crack at the state title for
one of the institution’s most powerful
teams in its tilt with North Carolina
at Chapel Hill Saturday week.
DeHart's Blue Devil crashed through
to their initial touchdown in the first
seven minutes of play to evidence their
superiority in an unmistakable man-
ner, They accomplished this task in
a brisk, business-like manner to forge
ahead and then promptly strengthen-
their advantage by exemplifying
the admonition of that well known
adage which says something about a
good offensive is always the best de-

in

chance for any fluke to beat them.
Duke took the opening kickoff and
on the fourth play chalked up the first

another first down and a punt carried
the ball to the Presbyterian’s 27-yard
line. Warren soon afterward blocked
a Davidson punt and Rosky recovered
for Duke on the visitor’s 13-yard line.

Successive assaults through the line
paved the way for a touchdown over
left tackle by Godfrey with Buie kick-
ing goal. Another seven points was
tallied in the first quarter after David-
son started filling the air with passes
that were consistently incompleted.

After an exchange of punts, Duke
uncorked a sparkling aerial drive be-
ginning with a pass from Buie to Mur-
ray that netted 18 yards. Another first
down resulted from a 10 yard floater
from Buie to Rosky. These series of

C. A. Promoted Tonight

Tonight has been set aside as the
night for the solicitation for the Frank
Price Mission Fund. the annual pro-
ject of the Y. M. C. A. Each room
on the campus will be visited and
everyone will have the opportunity to
contribute. It is hoped by the direc-
tors that each Davidson Man will feel
his opportunity and responsibility in
the support of Frank Price and will
make his gift as large as possible.
Money gifts or pledges payable by
April Ist may be made.

For several years Warren Cox was
supported in China. Last year Schol-
arships were given to Banner Elk
students. This year the Y. M. C. A.
has pledged to raise $1,000 for Frank
Price in China, The wonder of Price’s
work in the building of New China
has an appeal to all students wor'd-
minded in the interest- of Christ's
Kingdom, but Frank Price further de-
mands the loyalty of every Davidson
student, because he himself is an old
Davidson man and one that can be
‘pointed to with. sincere pride.

The Mission Display in the Y-Room
will continue through December.

Kell and Knox Talk
At Gastonia Church

“Y” Deputation Visits First
Presbyterian Church

who

A deputation composed of R. EF.
Kell and H. A, Knox visited Gastonia
Sunday night, December 2, for
vices at the First Presbyterian Church

ser-

‘This was the first of a number of
visits which have been planned to
nearby towns and cities.

Three meetings were held during
the evening. Knox spoke to the Sen-
ior Christian Endeavor while Kell
talked to the Junior Christian En-
deavor, The night church service

was turned over to the men at which
time Kell addressed the congregation.

“Prayer” was the subject of Knox's
talk in which he impressed his listen-
ers the importance it plays in the daily
life of a person. Kell discussed with
the Junior members the topic of
“Leadership” and at the Evening wor-
ship his discourse was upon “Love”.
In the latter talk Kell showed how
love was the fundamental principle of
Christianity.

The Deputation team will make
other visits during the winter. If any-
one desires the team to come to his
home town, he may see F. R. Brown
and he will try to make arrangements
to do so.

Change of Hour

Sunday, December 9, the Min-
isterial Band will change the hour
of meeting in an attempt to in-
crease attendance by getting men
who go on Sunday deputations
to come. The meeting, which
has formerly heen held at 2:3)
in Shearer, will) henceforth be
held at 1:30. A personal canvass
of the ministerial students is be-
ing. made to get a 100 per cent
attendance at the band meetings.

is expected to draw a crowd that will
fill Sherer Hall. The production, a
one-act play of present-day China,
has won recognition as the best of its
kind published last year. The scene
is laid in the office of the President
of a Western College; a Chinese Stu-
dent disgusted with the Christianity
of America rejects his fatth; his father
in China’is then encouraged to kill
Dr. McKean, the Missionary teacher
who sent Chun to America. Barbara
McKean, the Missionary’s. daughter,
by a most dramatic display of cour-
age and love wins Chun for Christ
and the heart of her lover for China.
The play is an effective, inspiring and
marvelous combination of humor, pa-
thos, life and love in its highest and
truest form.

Former Aviat Speaks on
“Wi ickedness of Folly”

At ie Vesoees last Sunday night,
Rev. A. J. McElway, of Laurel Hill,
N. C.,, former aviator in the World

War and student at Hampden-Sidney

| spoke,. using his text Roclesiaktes
1:17—"I applied my heart to know the
| wickedness of folly.”

as

“Sin and folly, a sinner and a fool,
jeach means the same thing,” Rev.
McElway stated. “The Matthew.

| Mark, and Luke Christ” spoke almost
entirely in terms of wisdom and fally
}and not of righteousness and sin. On-
ly in the last of the four Gospels,
| John, is the thedcratic term, sin, used.
In fact- throughout the whole canon
jof Scripture, the term folly is used
|more than sin to express evil.”

| “Today we are prone to separate
these terms as far as meaning is con-
cerned. For instance, some men are
really proud of being called sinners
while no one likes at all to be called
a fool, although there is essentially
/no difference.”

“The terms ‘folly’ and ‘wisdom’ are
therefore seen to have different mean-
ings in the eyes of God and in the
eyes of man. To get the right mean-
ing one cannot take the verdict of
the crowd. For instance, Wright
making his first attempts to fly, and
| Fulton making his first trip in his
| Steamboat, were each called fools by
the crowd, but were they? The crowd

proved to be the fool and not the
minority.”
“There are,” said Rev. McElway, “in

my mind, two great sins from which
j all others begin. They are, first, the
sin of living independent of God.
|Even though we admit that there is
ja God and profess Him, yet we at-
tempt to live without Him.”
