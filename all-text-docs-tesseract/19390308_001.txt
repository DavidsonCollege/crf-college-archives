with Chief William Linker; he,
Chief Henry Mosley and _ Patrol-

man Albert Goodrum of the Meck-

raided the home of John Lee Tor-
rence, colored, and found there
small quantities of whiskey. Also
found there were various articles
such as glasses, bottles, etc., indi-
cating that rather frequent booz-
ing parties were held. The liquor
found was perfectly legal in the
sense that it had been made up by
a standard company and all the
taxes paid on it,
into possession of it an
manner. Torrence claimgd that the
whiskey had been sold to him in
Charlotte, which in theory a
dry town. Apprehended at the
same time was Willie Torrence, a
relative of John Lee Torrence.
These two were tried Saturday
morning in the County Recorder’s
Court, at which time John Tor-
rence was fined $10 and costs,
while Willie was ruled not guilty.

A decidedly more important case
was begun when, early last Satur-
day morning, Chief William Link-

four five-gallon tins of bootleg
liquor. Caldwell’s case has been

house” in the physics labora-
tories in Chambers Building.
The object of this “open house”

was to show some of the principles
of physics through a series of nov-

el experiments. Members of the
club were on hand to demonstrate
these experiments. Some of them
were;

(1) A television outfit, showing
the effect of waves thrown on a
screen. A weird picture was the
result.

(2) An oscillograph: showing the

variation of electric waves on a

screen,

(3) A Tesla coil discharging 150,-
000 volts through the air, showing
burning effect and lighting up a

discharge tube.
(4) Expansion of a hollow tube
