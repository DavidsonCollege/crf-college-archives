Peace Coalition Completing
Moratorium Day Activities

Despite the failure to suspend

Classes, plans for the peace
moratorium § activities, sched-
uled for Thursday, are being

completed.

Ralph Peeples, spokesman for
the campus Peace Coalition,
said that Thursday's schedule
of events should be ‘“‘very full,
with something going on at all
times of the day.

“We want to crowd a lot into
one day. so that the community
can engage itself in as much as
is possible. There should be
something to stimulate the
thinking of everyone.” Peeples
said.

Two major speakers will be
the feature attractions for the
moratorium. Peeples emphas-

Gays of amazing archaeological
findings and  antnropological
theories.

Evans’ most intriging talk
Was on the ‘‘Transpacific Con
tact at 3000 B. C.,” in which he
spoke about the Japanese fish-
erman in Equador.

Evan's most intriguing talk
way: “Given a similar environ-
ment situation in two parts of
the world, an accidental intro-
cucuon of dierent elements can
eman in Equador.

Armed with color slides and
iu personal examination of over
500,000 pieces of pottery, Evans
began to develop his theory.

3ack in the Jomon period of
civilization in Japan, inhabitants
hving on the islands of Hok-
kaido (7000 B.C.) and Honshu
‘9000 B.C.) began the develop-
ment of a culture which includ-
ed pottery.

These orientals were primari-
lv fishermen not farmers, and
for approximately 5,000 years
they refined their crafts, creat-
ing characteristic designs for
their pottery.

Then sometime about 5,000
years ago (5,000 B.C.) a boat-
load or fleet of fishermen were
caught in a storm and thrown
at the mercy of the sea.

As fishermen, these Japanese
were able to survive while ocean

currents still present in the Pa-
cific Ocean carried them thous-
ands of miles across water.
finally depositing them on the
coast of Equador.

The sailors found that the
Equadorian people were living
in much the same way as they
did in Japan with a _ simliar
substence level, except that
they lacked pottery.

The sailors were accepted and
introduced this single idea into
tie toca! culture. At this point

Kinnaird

What ts form? How does one
believe in form? What is be-
vet! What is art? What is a
Richard Kinnaird?. What is a
yvood beginning?

There we were in Stowe Gal-
lery at the request of our art
history teacher, our studio art
teacher and the illustrious cam-
pus newspaper, with no idea of
what we were doing or how
we were doing it.

What we saw was the work
of one Richard Kinnaird, a pro-
fessor of studio art at U.N.C.-
Chapel Hill, whose speciality is
variety. .

The show includes works done
in’ the mediums of newspaper
collage, cut Masonite. fiber-
glass relief and plastic.

Everything is a play — of
form with form, color with col-
or and color with form.

His works can not be called
paintings nor can they be call-
ed sculpture, what they can be
called is off-the-wall reliefs.

The cut Masonite works are
layered and then colored into
intriguing compositional rela-
tionships. These are representa-
tive of Kinnaird’s early work—
but are not to be experienced
without knowledge of his future
works.

The display is a sampling of
Kinnaird’s art forms over the
years yet it is not arranged
chronologically ; therefore, one

cavations in Valdivia Bay on
the coast of Equador. Tnese are

ized that the speakers would be
scheduled around classes’ so
that as many as possible might
attend the talks.

Ron Young, one of the na-
tional directors of the Fellow-

ship of Reconciliation, an inter-
religious group of militant pac-
ifists, will speak Thursday
morning at 10. According to
Peeples, ““Young has been mil-
itantly active about seeking so-
cial change. particularly in re-
gards to the Vietnam War.”

Sister Elizabeth McAlister, a
member of the Harrisburg 12
accused of attempting to kid-
nap Presidential aide Henry
Kissinger. will speak either that
afternoon or evening. Peeples
said that the time of her speech
is not vet certain. for the David-
son peace group is sharing her
expenses with a similar group
at UNC-Charlotte. and she will
also be speaking there.

Peeples said that tentatively
there are plans for continual
discussion groups. led by fa-
culty members. Among those
professors Peeples mentioned
professors Ernie Patterson, SAdm
MecKelway.
Biglow. and

Maloney Sandy
Fred Gaige. Frank
Dave Kaylor.
Also, a speaker sponsored by
the Young Americans for Free-
dom will be present on cam
pus. YAF spokesman Bob Mor-
ey has indicated that Mike
Thompson. a veteran of the

Vietnam War and an anti-mor-

atorium leader, will be their
speaker.
Peeples said that during at

least one hour of the days ac-
tivities will be devoted to a
workshop on conscientious ob-
jection to war, and will be led
by several Davidson students
who have already been granted
a CO status.

Also, something similar to
guerilla theater, under the di-
rection of several students, will
be presented.

Peeples said that religious
services, under the leadership
of Ray Mendenhall, chairman
of the Campus Religious Life
Council, will also be held.

“We are not simply hitting
people with the morality of war
and the ethical debate it in-
volves.” Peeples said, “but we
are instead presenting related
issues as well.

“The purpose of the morator-
ium, which is being held in
conjunction with nationwide ac-
tivities of a similar ntaure, is
to stimulate and organize local
action against the war among
each community across. the
country,’ Peeples stated. ,

Peeples said that an attempt
to have classes for the day sus-
pended was considered, but
practical cons.derations and
“sound advice” from certain
members of the faculty brought
the moratorium committee to
decide to forget such efforts.

Kinnaird doesn’t seem to hide
