Mills discusses marriage and literature

By DAVID BEARCE

Professor Elizabeth Mills, a
visiting English lecturer, spoke on
Jan. 19 at 5 p.m. in the 900 Room.
Her talk was entitled “Marriage in
Literature and Marriage in Life,”
and it was sponsored by the
Women’s Concerns Committee.

Professor Mills based her talk
on “The Yellow Wall-Paper,” a
short story written by Charlotte
- Perkins Gilman. Gilman was a
writer during the late 19th century
and early 20th century. “The Yel-
low Wall-Paper” was later made
into a film.

_ “In the last ten years, this of-
fice has been successful in placing
at least 95 percent of these people

Wood said. “It is not something
students have to set up on their

Professor Mills first addressed
the question of why only stories of
bad marriages appear in literature.
She responded, “Life and litera-
ture are not the same. Marriage in
literature is different from mar-
riage in life: very different.

“Literature is a work of imagi-
nation,” and not intended to be “‘a
sociological document,” accord-
ing to Mills. Because a writer

-must keep the attention of his or ~
her audience, it is necessary to
concentrate on the most interest-
ing aspects of a marriage. A good
marriage makes a bad subject just

as “good people make boring sub-
jects. A character in a book who is
consistently well-behaved is prob-
ably bad for the book,” she said.

Mills read selections from Gil-
man’s diary concerning her mar-
riage. At first, Gilman’ was
euphoric about her marriage. But
later she recounts many bad feel-
ings and experiences in her diary.
Finally Gilman was sent to a phy-
sician to be treated for depression
and possible suicide.

Her physician recommended
that she live a completely domes-
tic life with her ehild, avoiding in-

ee

tellectual stimulation. Gilman fol-
lowed this advice until she began
to experience intense mental pain.
Gilman separated from her hus-
band in 1890 and then wrote “The
Yellow Wall-Paper.” The story
was an attempt to convince her
former physician to change his
practices of treating women.
Mills then showed the film
version of “The Yellow Wall-
Paper.” It portrayed a women kept
alone in a room under the advice
of her physician. The woman is
disturbed by the wallpaper in the
room. The woman eventually

loses sanity and is reduced to
crawling around the room tearing
down the wallpaper. Mills stres-
sed that this story is not an auto-
biography because Gilman lead an
active life untike the woman in her
story.

“Stories offer perceptions of
reality,” stated Mills. They allow
a reader to “transcend their own
eyes, past; and condition.” Mills
concluded by commenting that
while “reading is a spectator
sport, marriage requires participa-
tion.”

“It seems to me that Davidson

has been negligent in bringing
enough focus to bear on our
economic system and the way we
use money in our country and in
the world,” Wood said. “I feel
we're cranking out people with
the sole intention of making
money, but I’m not sure we’re
equipping them to deal with the
ethical problems of.our economy.
This institution is Presbyterian
and has an ambition to serve
people rather than exploit people.
I fear that sometimes we're put-

ting out people to be exploiters in
the name of the almighty dollar.”
