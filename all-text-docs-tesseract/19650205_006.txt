ROTC Officer Transfers *”
Here From S. Vietnam

has been reported in
Sports Jl.ustrated that pregnant
beagies can roan: over this
“lazy southern campus and
cross streets: at will without
fear of motestation.”” Such an
atmosphere mu:t be quite ironic
to Cav. Robert Crittenden,
newly ‘assigned to the David-
son ROTC Department.

Crittenden, who officially re-
sumed his new duties as of
Jan. 1, came here from a
year's assignment in Vietnam.
At that post, he spent. six
mon.hs at division operations
level.

Davidson’s new addition had
the misfortune to step on a
mine while in Vietnam, neces
sitating some extended medi-
cal .attention. “It was a small

one,” he said. “It didn't tear
my foot off.” Immediately re-
flecting on this remark, the
‘young Captain cmiled at his
own nonchatance.

In his tour of duty, Critten
den accumulated some reflec:
tions on the conduct of the
wat. He found the morale of
the soldier in the field was
high, even if proper leadership
and motivation were frequent-
ly lacking.

Noted Crittenden, “The Viet-
namese soldier is used to tur-
moil and constant change; he
operates on a day-to-day basis.”

He pointed {out that the
South Vietnamese army is not
a highly-trained, professional
organization, as one might ex-
pect from the relatively high
morale.

Of the Viet, Cong, he said,

Seminary President To Speak Here

Dr. James I. McCord, presi-
dent of Princeton Theological
Seminary and former Dean and
Professor of Systematic Theo-
logy at Austin Theological Sem-
inary, will speak in Vespers
Sunday night.

JAMES !. McCORD
Princeton Head

t

A native of Russia, Tex., Dr.
McCord received his AB from
Austin College in 1938. He
continued his study at Union
Theological Seminary in Rich-
mond, Va., and was awarded
his BD there. He studied also
at the graduate school of the
University of Texas while ser-
ving as instructor in the De-
partment of philosophy.

Dr. MeCord has attended Har-
vard University and New Col-
lege, University of Edinburgh.
‘He holds an MA from the
University of Texas: BD from
Austin College and Davidson
College: ThD, University of
Geneva; DD, Knox College and
Princeton University.

Besides his present admini-
strative post, Dr. McCord serv-
ed as pastor of the University
Presbyterian Church in Austin.
He continues to lecture in
schools and theological semi-
naries throughout Europe,
Canada and the US. He has
also published numerous artic-
les and reviews.

“, . This is a well-indoctrinat-
ed, disciplined body the prime
objective of which is the spread-
ing of propaganda. Their wea
pons and equipment have been
poor but they're getting better
all the time.”

He went oa to note a familiar
military generalization: one-
third of the people are loyal
to the government; one-third,
to the Viet Cong; and one-
third just want to be left alone.

Crittenden's division was
featured last spring in Life
magazine’s bloody pictoral on
the Southeast Asian conflict.
He was familiar with several
of the officers featured in that
story and recalled the activi-
ties of the pres in the area.

The sector featured in Life
is the favorite area for news
media and an easily accessible
region just south of Saigon.
The army, extremely sensitive
to the importance of public op-
inion in the Vietnam campaign,
supplies each newsman with

his, own helicopter and all the
cooperation one could desire.

Crittenden recalled with a
smile one newsman who had
interviewed him. He later re-
ceived the paper end discover-
ed, as many unfortunately have.
that he was credited with some
observations he hadn't made.

Davidson’s newest faculty
member was graduated from
VPI in 1957 with a degree in
architectural engineering. De-
spite his lack of local ties, he
still prefers to call Richmond
his home. He and his wife now
live in Cornelius.

Crittenden will be an instruc-
tor in all military science class-
es (on a subject rather than
a class level) and his tour will
probably be for three years. He
appeared happy with his new
post; “I requested an assign-
ment in this area and I'm very
pleased with the school. The
atmosphere couldn't be friend-
lier.”

STUDENTS AND FACULTY COMMENT

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1965

President Will Jackson urged that the Student Council
adopt a resolution to support the faculty’s stand on the

North Carolina Speaker
ly meeting Monday night.

His proposal took only the
form of a suggestion, however,
since all action at this meeting
was unofficial due to lack of a
quorum.

Eleven representatives consti-
tute a quorum, and only ten of
the sixteen members were able
to attend the meeting. Jackson
explained that the absentees had
responsibilities at the Pledge
Banquet held that same even-
ing.

Jackson also announced the up-
coming meeting of the State
Student Legislature. He asked
that anyone desiring to attend
this meeting in Raleigh Febru-
ary 18-20, see him. The Student
Council, he added, might as-
sume part of the expenses of the
trip.

“The first report of the Fra-

Jackson, noting that this was

Effectiveness Of Humanities Evaluated

By BOB HOLLADAY
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Now in the third year

since its inception, David-
son’s Humanities program
has become to approximate-

sophomores a familiar part
of their academic lives.

THE DAVIDSONIAN last
week interviewed students
and. professors involved in
the course to discover their
views of the program’s ef-
fectiveness.

“We feel that the program
has developed and is succeed-
ing perhaps to a greater degree
than we had a right to hope,”
said Dr. Daniel D. Rhodes, pro-
fessor of Bible and chairman
of the first-year teaching team

IN MONDAY CHAPEL

Wright Urges Honesty

Tze mischievous hand of fate
fel uso Dr Willlam Mes +o
Wright Monday morning at 10:20
a.m. Associate Dean of Students
at DePauw University, Wright
initiated the IFC speaker series.

“. mpete Honest y—bah,
Hum svg!" was the topic for

ersion. If no one leaned for-
ward in rapt attention at the
announcement of the topic, no
one disputed its relevance.
Wright attacked the moral
honesty of his generation.
Growing out of this situation,
he felt, was a failure to com-

did hit all the ‘high points.
Brotherhood, he pointed out,

and it isn't merely friendship.

is not such a nebulous term

of six professors.

“It has been our hope that
students who take these courses
will have a sense of where they
come from—to understand their
spiritual and philosophical men-
tors—in the hope that we all
will be able to cope with our
modern situation in a meaning-
ful way.

“We are not unique in this’
among courses at Davidson,
Rhodes pointed out. The main
difference for the Humanities
student as compared to the stu-
dent who did not elect to enroll
in‘the course is the integration
of materials. Receiving from the
inter-disciplinary course credit
toward the fulfillment of history,
Bible, and English require-
ments, the student reads in
chronological order materials
covering the entire span of
Western civilization.

Rhodes said that the volun-
tary nature of enrollment in the
Humanities course “creates the
conditions in which you can
have a lively discussion” be-
tween Humanities students and
students who get a different
viewpoint by studying each dis-
cipline separately.

MORE EASE

Dr. George Labban, professor
of Greek and also a member of
the first-year team, said, “The
students last year and certain-
ly this year reflect more ease
in the course. It's not new—
both students and instructors
know what ta expect.”

He said that one advantage of
the course might be an increase
in the quality and quantity of
material that could be offered
in other courses. “I would like
to see this as a motivation for
professors’ ‘beefing-up’ of a
number of their courses because
of the higher number of Hu-
manities students in them.”

Dr. Richard C. Cole, professor
of English and also a member
of the first-year team, said that
a full evaluation of the course
would in his opinion be most
possible next year. “I'm hoping
we can make out an elaborate
questionnaire to give out to the.
seniors next year to evaluate the
Humanities course in its value
in the last two years here.”

CAFETERIA-STYLE

Dr. Philip B. Secor, professor
of political science and a mem-
ber of the second-year Humani-
ties team, said, ‘Mostly I'm
very enthusiastic about it. I

think it does get around the
problems of  ‘cafeteria-style’
education’ in its integrated ap-
proach.

He noticed differences in oth-
er classes between Humanities
and non-Humanities students.
“Students who've had Humani-
ties are more eager to partici-
pate. There’s a value to intro-
ducing freshnjen and _ sopho-
mores to the seminar program.”

He also assessed the personal
value the course had for him.
“There's no doubt that it has
a special kind of value for those
who teach it. It makes me a
better teacher in my own dis-
cipline to.see how my subject
relates to others.”’

“Essentially. the program
hasn’t changed much since we
made it.” Rhodes said, explain.
ing that. the organization of the
course had been worked out
during the two summers and
the school year prior to the
course’s beginning.

CHANGES

The main changes in the first
year program were two. The
team decided to omit the library
paper required during first se-
mester, continuing with required
short essays. Then, during sec-
ond semester, the student was
required to write a library paper
in addition to the themes. ‘We
think the results have verified
our procedures,” Rhodes said.

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts said the attitude toward
the program had become more
positive. ‘‘I sense a change in
comment from the time we
started this. I felt there was a
negativism in the very begin-
ning because of the standards
and very likely because it is
a more demanding academic
program. People got kind of
scared of it and whatever hap-
pened people used as a justifi-
cation of their fears."

‘Burts said the closest thing
to a lability that students might
experience if enrolled in Hu-
manities was the pressure the
reduced academic load for fresh-
men placed on them not to fail
the course. Once failed, the
freshman would under normal

circumstances be certain of

having to attend summer school
in order to enroll as a sopho-
more in the succeeding fall.
Referring to this reduced load
for freshmen, Rhodes said that
he had hoped the reduced load
would encourage freshmen to

work harder and more intensive-
ly. By and large, it hasn’t. “‘The
students are more relaxed and
this may be good. On the other
band, we've been disappointed
that this hasn’t shown up in the
grades as yet.’
“BEST WE’VE GOT”

Burts said that he strongly
supported the course, despite
the narrow safety margin for
flunkers. *‘Many mén shy. away
from it, but I think they're
shying away from the best in-
structional program we've got.”

Students reaction was widely
varied. One junior said, ‘‘T feel
real. strongly that it was good—
I think it’s been about half my
education already. It saves the
students all the synthesizing he'd
have to do some other time out
of class—plus the forced read-
ing in fields outside my regular
interests.”’

Another junior expressed re-
gret that he had missed much
of the course's significance. “I
think the discipline it gives you
and the intellectual inspiration
it gives you are valuable, but
you miss a lot of it. You’re going
so fast over such significant
material at a time in your edu-
cation when you are just begin-
ning to be aware of human
problems, that I think a lot of
the specific material is lost on
you.

“You get historical periods
et cetera, but I feel it's a shame
that I'm able to look back and
see how much more I could

A freshman just out of his
first semester of Humanties
called it ‘‘my favorite course.”
He appreciated getting the diffi-
cult material right away. Hel.

Humanities because “it sounded
better than Bible and everything

PROBLEM

A sophomore discussed a prob- |
Jem that had bothered him dur-
ing the course: ‘‘the professors,
having to teach subjects outside
their chosen fields would nat-
urally come out with different
students having different view-
points in the same course.” He
knew of one professor who had
stressed Alexander Pope's idea
of God in the ‘Essay on Man,”
while another had said the idea
was concerned only with the
idea of man, God not entering
into it except in a remote sense.

Law at the Council’s week-

that the committee would con-
tinue to meet.

_ Tommy Heffner told the Coun-
cil that students from Amherst
Coilege would be visiting Da-
vidson late in March on a kind
of “cultural exchange pro-
gram.” They will attend classes
and mingle with the student
body to gain some insight into
student life at Davidson.

Heffner said that about twen-
ty-five Davidson students had
expressed a desire to travel to
Amherst during spring break for
similar activities there.

The evening's discussion pro-
gressed with a critical discus-
sion of the inventory of the Col-
lege bookstore. Bill Council ex-
pressed a desire to see the
variety of the publications avail-
able increased to please a great-
er number of students.

Tom Frist introduced the final
item of discussion when he
asked if the Council could aid |
in finding information on sum-
mer jobs in Europe. He men-
tioned that he had heard of
students earning travel money
by helping with archaeological
expeditions.

Chuck Matthews said that Ed
Armfield had been assigned the
job of chairman of student
travel, and that those interested
in such a program should see
him.
