ebration" week. The annual mem-
bership drive was broadcast live
‘from the Morrison Room in the

air in pairs, urging listeners to call
in their support for WDAV. +

Students and a volunteer core
of about 150 people from the
WDAYV listening area helped out
answering phones and taking
pledges. Neighboring food estab-

lishments donated food for the
week.

“Celebration” is held each fall
to increase membership and raise
money to support the 100,000 watt
Davidson College radio station.

fundraiser, said that this year’s goal
was 2400 members, which includes

bers.

$500,000 budget comes from
membership pledges and program
underwriting from businesses.
According to Station Manager
John Clark, this total is higher
than most public radio stations.
Another function of “Cel-
ebration” is to accent WDAV’s
support of not only classical mu-
sic, but “the arts” in general.
During the week, guest perform-
ers, Community announcers, and
guests from various arts organi-
zations supplement the normal
schedule of classical music.

Attacked in South Carolina
Kimbrough Shot, Robbed in Beaufort

By Mandy Curtis

Tish Kimbrough, secretary in
the Dean of Students office, was
shot in the mouth on Friday, Octo-
ber 9 while touring Beaufort, South
Carolina. After dining in a restau-
rant in the small town, Kimbrough
and her companion, Francis
Hillman of Concord, were attacked
by two men in the parking lot.
After shooting Kimbrough, the
men stole both of the women’s
purses.

Kimbrough and three other
women from Concord were tour-

ing the historical South Carolina
town that weekend. Having fin-
ished the candlelight tour, the
women went to eat at a restaurant
only two blocks from the bed and
breakfast where they were staying.
At 10 o’clock Kimbrough and
Hillman walked out to the parking
lot. After the two women got in,
two men immediately appeared on
either side of the car. One, with a
ski mask on, stopped Kimbrough
from closing her door.

According to Kimbrough, the
first thing she can remember is the

gun that the man held about twelve
inches from her face and then a
shot. Before saying anything, the
man shota bullet that wentthrough
Kimbrough’s upper-lip, hit her
teeth, and lodged itself in the back
ofherneck. He, like the otherman,
proceeded to reach across
Kimbrough to grabher purse. With
that, they took off.

“Tthappened so fast; itcouldn’t
have been more than two seconds,”
stated Kimbrough, “There was a

Clinton Preferred

in a Campus Poll
Democrat Leads Bush 47% to 33%

By Tom Koonce

Tomorrow the people de-
cide. Will President George Bush
beelected for asecond term length-
ening the Reagan-Bush era to six-
teen years? Will Governor Bill
Clinton succeed in convincing
Americans of the need for change
and put a Democrat back in the
White House? Or will Ross Perot
pull off a miracle by persuading
Americans that they need to move
away from party politics and elect
an independent? We should know
the answer as to who will be our
next president by tomorrow night
around ten, unless the trend of this
election year continues and the
unpreditcable occurs, sending a
close race to the Electoral College
to be decided or maybe ultimately
toa vote in the House of Represen-
tatives.

National public opinion polls
have beena partof the daily report-
ing of this year’s presidential “horse
race.” This past week members of
the Davidson Young Democrats
conducted their own poll of the

Davidson campus to determine
who the majority of the student
body preferred to be the next Presi-
dent. The group polled-727 stu-
dents under the guise of reporters
for the Davidsonian.

Out of the 727 students polled
Governor Bill Clinton was pre-
ferred by 47.3% of the respon-
‘dents, President George Bush by
32.5% and Ross Perot by 6.4%.
13.3% of the students polled were
undecided. The poll did not differ-
entiate between whether or not the
student planned to vote. .

College Democrats and Re-
publicans have also been working
hard on this campus to try and
further the cause of their candi-
dates. Several students have vol-
unteered at campaign offices
around the county.

The Young Democrats volun-
teered in Charlotte and helped out
in organizing and preparing for
Governor Clinton’s rally last
month. They arranged for a bus to
