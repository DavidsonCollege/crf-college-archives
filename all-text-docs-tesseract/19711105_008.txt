To News Hazards

If someone in your neighbor-
hood is watching the evening
news, he could be potentially
hazardous to your health.

Leonard Berkowitz, _ presi-
dential commission member and
chairman of the psychology de-
partment at the University of
Wisconsin, proposed this thesis
in an address Tuesday.

Berkowitz pointed to FBI data
which showed a marked rela-
tionship between a rise in seri-
ous crime and publicized in-
cidents like the Speck and
Whitman murders, the Detroit
riots, and the assasinations of
Jolin Kennedy and Martin Luth.-
er King.

‘Aggressive behavior may be
impulsive,” said Berkowitz.
“The observed event has par-

ticular, aggressive meaning to
the observer. Internal aggressive
reactions can stimulate other
aggressive behavior.”

The probability that an in-
dividual will respond to pub-
licized violence with aggres-
sive behavior is very small, but
with the size of our population
this still presents a problem.

“What we finally do depends
on our values, not our social
seiences.”

Campus Security Problems

AN ANALYSIS
By BILL GIDUZ

Staff Writer

One of the problems that has
arisen in the past few years
as a result of Davidson's in-
creasing contact with the out-
side world and relaxation of
rules is one of campus secur-
ity.

Dean of Students Will Terry
remarked that the crime rate
ou campus has risen markedly
during the past two years.
“There are more outsiders on
. we have a lot of

campus . .
local kids in the dormitories
who have no business being
there.”

The problem of outsiders on
campus was echoed by Grover
Meetze, director of campus se-
curity. Meetze cited the fact that
the campus is becoming better
known through its general open-
ness and special group visits
such as summer camps.

Most of the people caught for
theft are not members of the
college, but Meetze pointed out
that students can steal small
items and money more easily
than can non-students because
they are not conspicuous in the
dorms.

EPC Contacts Colleges
For Data On Coeducation

Despite students belief to the
contrary, the college, in its own
hesitant manner, is doing some.
thing about coeducation. The
Educational Policy Committee's
(EPC) coeducation subcommit-
tee is presently contacting col-
leges comparable to Davidson
which have recently gone coed.

Headed by Associate Profes-
sor of History William B. Pat-
terson, the EPC subcommittee
on coeducation has already done
a substantial amount of work.

It has recently met with the
Student Government Association
(SGA) committee on coeduca-
tion, and the EPC coeducation
committee has been favorably
impressed by some of the re-
commendations of the SGA com.
mittee.

The SGA committee on co-
education is pushing for the
adoption of a plan that would
allow Davisdon to accept wom-
en for the next academic year.

Patterson, though sympathe-
tic to this view, feels that next
fall is an unfeasible date for
the introduction of coeducation.
However, Patterson does feel
that coeducation could be prac--
tical in two years.

The EPC is not studying the
philosophical reasons for or
against coeducation, since this
has been done in the past.
Rather, -it -is trying to find out
the technical details confront-

ing a college going coed.- The
coeducation subcommittee is
presently in contact with about

ten colleges which have re-
cently gone. coed to discover
some of the problems these
schools have been faced with.

In conjunction with the alum-
ni office, it is sending out a
questionnaire about coeducation
to the alumni. In addition, the
coeducation subcommittee _ is
planning to poll the faculty and
student body about certain as-
pects of Davidson becoming co.
educational.

If it were not for these ques-
tionnaires, Patterson feels that
the EPC coeducation subcom-
mittee could make a report on
the feasibility of coeducation to
the EPC hy the end of this
term. In any event, Patterson
feels that his subcommittee will
be making a report to the EPC
in the very near future.

The members of the EPC
subcommittee on coeducation
ere agreed that Davidson
Should go coeducational, but it
is still unclear to them when
and how this should be done.

purposes and goals of an ed-
ucationa! institution will remain
unrealized.

Brinkley listed 12 instances
since 1965 which he said com-
pused a history of the trustees
“replete with instances of dis-
respect for the professional aca-
demician, of contempt for fa-
culty judgment, and of distrust
of faculty loyalties and motiva-
tions.”

In a series of recommenda-
tions Brinkley asked that all
work on the Governance Com-
mittee as well as work on other
committees which have faculty
members be suspended until the
faculty and trustees attempt to
solve the problem of confidence
in the faculty.

No faculty action was taken
on Brinkley’s proposals, and
faculty sources remain uncer-
tain on just how much support
these proposals have in the fa-
culty as a body.

The faculty will continue their
debate on the governance is-
sue when Spencer returns later
this month.

The present three man (one
per eight hour shift) security
force serves almost strictly as
a watchman agency rather than
as a true law enforcement
group. Security officers have
been given direct orders by
Meetze not to enter the dorm
rooms on campus, and he fur-
ther pointed out that the only
reason officers enter the dorms
at all

clocks.

Checking on suspicious char-
acters, answering complaints,
and patrolling the grounds are
the main duties of the Davidson
security officers.

Meetze explained the philoso-
phy of the security department.
“‘We’ve started out here on a
very low key type security
force and we'll develop it as
trends make it necessary, but
we don’t want to move too
fast.”

It is evident that most David-
son students seem happy with
the present security force, and
would rather not see it highly
expanded.

At the same time, though,
outside and inside influences
could force that expansion and
the security force would then
be faced with the problem of
becoming too much of an en-
forcement agency.

It appears that a thin line
needs to be drawn to simul-
taneously cope _ with rising
crime and too much law en-
forcement, which many times
follows the former.

Terry outlined his thoughts
on what is needed. ‘‘We need
a better trained security force
to handle emergencies . . . and
one which has better rapport
with students. We need a man
in charge of security who has

a desire to get along with stu-
dents. He also has to be able
to supervise other men.”

Terry expressed his opinion
that a couple of more full time
men are needed to cut out the
need for Burns Security Force
men and to concentrate on spe-
cific areas of the campus.

is the campus really protect-
ible with the type of security
force that is desired? Meetze
feels that because of the very
size of the campus, an extra
man on duty would probably
not substantially cut down on
burglary.

The fraternity court is an es-
pecially vulnerable area. For
convenience purposes, most
fraternities remain unlocked at:
night, and until recently this
has not presented any prob-
lems. During the past few
months, however, at least two
stereo turntables have been
taken from houses on the court.

Even though just one more
man may not do much good,
it appears that a much strong-
er, much larger security sys-
tem could cut down on campus
thievery.

However, all parties involved
are opposed to this idea. ‘‘We
would rather take it easy than
have to become a full-fledged
police force,” said Meetze.

Budgetwise, a larger force is
quite feasible, and, according
to Terry, more money will be
allocated to the force next year.

Ultimately, the students wilt
decide the type of campus se-
curity. To avoid a real police
force on campus, students will
have to play a more active role
in preventing campus crime.

Students should lock their cars
and report strangers and

strange activity in the dorms.
