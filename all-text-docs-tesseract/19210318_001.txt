Dr. W. W. Moore Delivers Fourth
Series of Lectures on Otts Foundation

DAVIDSON COLLEGE. DAVIDSON, N. C., MARCH 18, 1921.

tnent Theologian Discusses “The Permanence of the Christian Ideal” in
Bminen Masterfal Addresses-Works to be Published in Book Form.

Rev. Dr. W. W. Moore, D.D., LL.D., president of Union Theologica!
Seminary, of Richmond, Va., delivered the fourth series of lectures under

the Otts Foundation,
day, the 12th, and Sunday, the 13th.

The Otts Foundation was established
by the Rev. Dr. J. M. P. Otts, then of
Alabama, in 1893. The lectures are in
defence of Christianity against current
heresies, especially such as may seem
directed against the foundations of the
Christian faith. The first series was de-
livered by Dr. Otts himself; the second
by Dr. Robert L. Dabney, and the third
by Dr. J. B. Shearer. It is understood
that Dr. Moore, following the custom of
his predecessors, will publish his lec-
tures. In all probability the volume will
be available by the middle of the com-
ing summer.

Dr. Moore, a member of the class of
1878 of Davidson College, is well known
as the president of one of the best
known theological seminaries of our
Southern Church. His learning, his tact,
his consecrated work, is at once the
property and the glory of his alma mater
and the whole Southern Presbyterian
Church. He is, to use the words of a
member of the faculty, “an alumnus
whom this or any other college could
well of proud of.” Through the years
he has been a constant and loyal friend
of Davidson, ever solicitous of her wel-
fare. Elsewhere in this issue is an in-
terview with him in which he has
sketched Davidson as he has known her
and as he hopes she will be in the years
to come.

Perhaps the best tribute that can be
paid to the personal charm and mag-
netism of Dr. Moore is that he held the
attention of an audience composed main-
ly of college boys through a lecture on
Apologetics; and he did it not once, but
three times. From an easy platform
Position, using the simple old Anglo-
Saxon words, without show or affecta-
tion, Dr. Moore ably defended the great
truths of our faith. .

In discussing “The Permanence of the
Christian Ideal’ Dr. Moore saw fit to
divide the subject into three phases.
Saturday morning he discussed “The
Impregnable Center” of the Christian
ideal; Sunday morning “The Embodied
Ideal” of Christianity, and Sunday night,
in the concluding lecture, “The Moral
Power of History,” it was shown that
history has vindicated the ideals of
Christ.

Noted French Lecturer
Speaks Friday Night

M. Emile Villemin Comes to Davidson
Under Auspices of Le
Cercle Francais

“Le Cercle Francais” takes great pleas-
ure in announcing that they have se-
cured the services of the noted French
lecturer, M. Emile Vilemin, for Friday
night, March 18th. ‘M. Villemin, sent to
us from the headquarters of “L’Alliance
Francaise,” as official lecturer of “The
French Alliance,” comes with a wonder-
fully successful lecture upon the sub-
ject, “Le Mont Saint Miehel.” M. Ville-
min brings with him stereopticon views
itlustrating the wonders and beauties of
the subject, and explains them to his
hearers in a most distinct and forcible
French.

French students and enthusiasts are
calted upon to support this first attempt
of what we hope will be a series of such
entertainments. “The French Alliance”
sends annually a group of noted lectur-
ers to its chapters throughout the coun-
try, and M. Villemin is the first to be
sent to the local chapter. French stu-
dents are not only asked to come out to
enjoy a night’s entertainment and to
receive this distinguished visitor to our
campus, but also to rally to this high
standard set by the local “Le Cercle
Francais.” '

M. Villemin is quite a student of his
language, being the author of several
plays and text books. Especially notice-
able is his book, “Natural Method to
Pronounce French.” In his lecture he
will pronounce it-so clearly that even
the most inexperienced ear will be able
to comprehend the subject. Felix Weill,
General Secretary of “L’Alliance Fran-
cais” wrote to Dr. Lingle: “M. Villemin
cannot make his lecture in English, or
even a part of it; but he expresses him-
self so clearly in French that I am sure
the audience will not have the slightest
difficulty to follow the development of
his talk.”

NEW SERGEANT ADDED TO
PERSONNEL OF R. O. T. C.

Another sergeant has been added to
the R. O. T. C. personnel. Sergeant J.
P Marshall, Cavalary, comes to David-
son from recruiting service at Hickory,
N. C. He is a veteran in army service,
having been in the Cavalary: for nine
years. During the war he saw six
months overseas service. He was supply
sergeant for an ammunition train. His
home is close to Davidson, at Concord,
N. C, and he should understand our
ways pretty well.

Three schools in this area were given
honorable mention by the inspector who
has just completed his tour. They were
Auburn, Citadel and Clemson.

Mr. W. W. White, of Atlanta, Ga.,
spent the week-end on the hill visiting
his son, Houston White, '21.

Copies of Annual to Be
Ready May Tenth

Quips and Cranks of 1921 to be
Dedicated to “Dad”

The ‘21 QUIPS AND CRANKS will un-
doubtedly be the best annual in the his-
tory of the college. The engraving,
which is of the best workmanship, has
been finished and the proofs have been
received.

The annual went to press on February
14th, and it is thought that the copies
will be ready for delivery by the 10th
of May.

Probably the most unique feature of
the annual is the fact that it is dedicated
to one who does much for us and gets
little credit: “Dad.”

The annual is made up of six books;
the first book is composed of Campus
Scenes, Faculty, Annual Staff, and Con-
tributors.
Calendar; the third, Athletics; the
fourth, Fraternities; the fifth, Organiza-
tions; and the sixth, “The Wildcat
Weakley” and Advertising Section.

The first 24 pages are done in sepia
on cameo ivory paper, which adds much
to the appearance and quality of the an-
nual.

On the cover, which is stiff, is an em-
bossed picture of Chambers Building
as viewed from the side. The composi-
tion of delicate colors in the picture add
to the beauty of the stately old building.

Sixty pages are assigned to Athletic
department. Each “D” man has an in-
dividual picture and write-up. In other
departments of Athletics there are group
pictures: Golf, Tennis, and the Cham-
pion Class Basketball Team.

The humorous section is especially
good. Of all the humor in the world,
it is said, none can be compared with col-
lege humor. The “Calendar” is import-
ant, in as much as it records the David-
son “notables.” (If the “Calendar” didn’t
get you, the ‘AWWildcat Weakley” did!)

It isn’t too late to get your extra
annuals. You can get them with your

in Mortal Combat

Sir Massey Carries the Field Against
All Combatants

Ye gods and little fishes. The shadows
of the great minds of the past have been
brooding over the campus for the last
two weeks and have been lending their
genius and brains to the worthy com-
batants in the greatest contest that this
little college has ever seen. The strat-
egy of the football gridiron, the care-
fully worked out plans of the basketball
team, the.minor tactics of the R. O. T. C.
even fade into insignificance when com-
pared with the great brainwork which
modern knight-errants have exemplified
in their recent conflict.

With the checkerboard as their battle-
field, with the checker men to carry out
their bidding, these warriors clad in
their intelligence have fought to the
jdeath. Twenty-six valiant heroes risk-
ed their lives in the dangerous contest,
and but one survived the ordeal. With
impregnable armor, with an attack that
could not be stopped, Sir Massey com-
pletely put to rout all opponents and
overcame the entire field.

Great and terrible was the conflict; the
sound of clashing arms and falling bodies

names—or if you choose, “her” name—| smote sharp on every ear. Each hero

ordered now if you failed to do so he-
fore. Don’t fail to pay up your dues, be-
cause all annuals must be paid for be-
fore any deliveries are made.

Wildcat Wrestling Team
Makes First Appearance

Washington and Lee and V. M. 1. Win
From Davidson Mat Artists

W. and L. Match.

In their first wrestling meet Davidson
suffered defeat at the hands of Wash-
ington and Lee gn the latter’s mats last
Friday night, by a score of 26 to 3.

Washington and Lee finished a very
successful wrestling season with this
meet, and having done excellently with
both V. P. I. and the Army earlier in the
season.

Due to the fact that this was David-
son's first appearance in this form of
college sports and to any absence of
expert coaches along this line of com-
petition, Davidson supporters are very
well peased with the showing made by
Captain Cumming and his men against
their more experienced opponents.

In the 115 pound class, McGill of W.
and L. won a decision over Cummings of
Davidson after the latter had held the
upper hand by a head hold and scissor

(Continued on page 2)

sallied forth with a large following cheer-
ing him on to victory, and many and
disappointed were the cohorts of the de-
feated. Clad in his armor of gold, Sir
Nesbitt seemed impregnable, but the
quick eye of his opponent caught him
unawares and cast him to the ground at
the very onset. Sir Lewis, of moving
picture fame, was also chosen as a win-
ner, but his cohorts were doomed to dis-
appointment. .

The four who lasted to the very end
were the Green Knight, Palmer; the Red
Knight, Bailey; the Black Knight, Mc-
Caskill; the White Knight, Massey. The
Green and Red fought to and fro in
mortal conflict, the thunder of clashing
armor and the click of the sharp swords
could be heard for miles. But, finally
when the dust of battle had cleared
away, the Red Knight had fallen and the
Green Knight limped off the field victor-
ious. By consummate skill and lightning-
like movements, the great White Knight
easily overcame the Black Knight and
then the Red Knight and remained the
conqueror of the conquerored.

The issues at stake were great, the
fighting was of the first order, the chiv-
alry of the contestants could not have
been surpassed, and the tournament will
pass in history along side with those
held by the Knights of the Round Table
in the day of King Arthur.

Many students took short trips, and

Knights of Checkerboard!

An unusually Jarge corps of

Speakers and Leaders.

Mr. Charles F. Evans, Southern States
Secretary of Christian Endeavor,will be
present for address and conferences on
methods. Mr. Evans is brimful of good
plans and knows how to put them over
in great style. He is a great leader, as
all who have heard him realize.

Dr. C. M. Richards, pastor of the Dav-
idson Church, will conduct the devotion-
al exercises at the opening of the Sat-
urday afternoon and night and Sunday
atternoon sessions, and will preach the
convention sermon Sunday morning. The
delegates have a real treat in store in
hearing Dr. Richards. The devotional
spirit is being stressed in the convention
plans and will be in the convention it-
self, and large results are expected.

Mr. Frank Wilson, Field Secretary for ,
North Carolina and Virginia, will be
present to help in the conference and the
general inspiration of the convention.
Since his graduation from the Presbyte-
rian College of South Carolina, he has
been doing splendid work as a Christian
Endeavor. field man and will be a big
help in making the convention a success.

Rev. Daniél Iverson, of the Tenth
Avenue Presbyterian Church of Char-
lotte will deliver an address Saturday
night. A minister who plays the piano
is unusual, but Mr. Iverson is unusual in
more ways than this. He is full of life
and an enthusiastic believer in Christian
Endeavor as the training school of the
church.

Mrs. W. H. Howell, of Wilmington,
State Junior Superintendent. will direct
the work for the younger boys and girls.
Mrs. Howell is the mother of one of the
Davidson students, and he will be justly
proud to have his Davidson friends know
and hear her. A heart full of love for
boys and girls and a large experience in
work for them will make her a valuable
addition to the convention program.

Mr. G. M. Beaty, of Charlotte, State
Intermediate Superintendent will have
charge of the work for the boys and girls
