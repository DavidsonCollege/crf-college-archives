“A TALE OF BATH.”

There are times
When beastly crimes
Have sounded forth o’er hill and crest,
And blood runs cold,
And mothers hold
Their whimpering children to their
breast.

But oh the shame
That we must name
The most atrocious crime of all,
For it’s enough
To turn necks rough,
Or make hair rise and let it fall.

So listen well
While we dispell
All happy, joyful thoughts of yore,
And tell to you
A story true,
A tale that makes the tears brim o’er.

Not long ago—
A week or so —
All Georgia, Watts,
joined,
And: soon they made
A mob-like raid,
And Rumple’s loafing bench purloined.

Then hostile grew
The Rumple crew,
And said a few unholy words,
And did not wait
To long debate
But threw all cautions to the birds.

For Rumple knew,
And knew ‘twas true,
She only had to wet her foes
To win unscathed,
For they are bathed
But yearly, as appearance shows.

But ah the shame
That we can name
A few, who did not, would not, fight,
And be it known
That they have shown
A spirit that is pepless quite.

And thus engaged
The battle waged ;
Until the very ground was soaked,
And often those
Of Rumple’s foes
Were wet and washed and nearly
croaked.

And O the din
Would make you grin,
And wondrous sights would make you
stare,
For Hawkins smote
From off his throat
A drop of water sprinkled there.

And Lawson tore
His pompadour
And swore he'd never wash again,
And Flossie White,
Who lost that night
A half his weight, replied “Amen.”

And who will say
That Dishongh's bray
Seemed louder for to those inside
Than Ben White's yell
As water fell
And landed on his dusty hide.

And on that lawn
Dark thoughts were born,
And plans for terrible revenge.
For they did blate
A hymn of hate
And tush their suffering to avenge.

A full six score
They rushed and bore
Awav a Rumpleite or two,
With wrath intense
Thev bore them hence
To Watts to wet them thru and thru.

And all that night
And following night
They made for once their showers flow,
But Rumple smiled
With tempers mild
For they were used to H20.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, May 2, 1917

And e’er we end
We fain would lend
A moral to this tale so harsh,
For we would pray,
And pleading say
To Georgia, Watts, and Chambers,
“Was.”

—watch the rich, mellow soil fall heav-
ily; see the upturned mouse nest and
see with Burns the “Wee sleekit, cowrin,
tim’rous beastie,’ and have pity at the
sight of that “Wee bit heap o’ leaves and
stibble.” On the most disagreeable warm
day which comes, let Keats visualize for
you in his vivid imagery in “The Eve of
St. Agnes.” ‘Ihe time spent in reading
Dickens is a pleasure and one appre-
ciates his power of vivid description,
and new jdeas present themselves in
quantities.

This is, in the worn out expression,
killing two birds with one stone. You
will have experienced some of the most
recreative hours of your life. And in
the second place, of the many things ac-
quired, you have a vast fund of whole-
some knowledge which you would not
otherwise have gotten. You have as-
similated a better expression for your
own thoughts. You have had real aes-
thetic pleasure in that you know the best
lof the world’s best expression. You
get a close contact with nature and an
intimate association with human nature
thru the character personage of litera-
ture, which is one of the best ways of

be much better prepared to-do whatever.
your brain seeks to do. Unconsciously
you are in contact with concentration
and study.

For this position very little experi-
ence is necessary. Another feature, you
have choice of preferred territory.
