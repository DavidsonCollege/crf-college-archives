We've Been Wondering
Why all the fellows out at the track meet
last Saturday didn’t take the Dry Cleaner’s
tages off their clothes before appearing in
public.
You can wander anywhere in the United
States, but you have to go to Italy to Rome.

Why isn't this the morning after the night
before?

Because Junior Speaking started only this

love Dantzig.”

Buck Shaw—"Then shall we step out on
the floor and have a dance, or is your cold
too bad?”

married to the most beautiful girl in the
world.”
She—"Oh, Jimmy, were we happy ?”

John as the old Stutz rounded the curve

The latest fad in the Northern co-ed col-
leges is to wear men’s socks over the ladies’
hose. The girlies say that this is quite hot
even in the coldest weather, and it looks lots
better than those ungainly galoshes,

“Did you get all the questions on the test ?”

“Yes, it’s the answers that I missed.”

“May, aren't you getting too big to play
with the boys?”

“Oh, no, Mother, the bigger I get the bet-
ter I like them.”

with the falsetto voice?”

At Easter one’s finest thoughts are aroused
--apathy is challenged--a desire to express one’s
finer self is awakened into glorious activity.

How better can you, with your natural and
inherent love for fine things, convey your
nobler sentiments to friends and loved ones
than with “Unusual Candies?”
