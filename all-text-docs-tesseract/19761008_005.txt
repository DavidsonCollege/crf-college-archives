Letters to the editor

To the Editor:

As a new recruit of the cold, cruel
world, I have to admit that IT was
pleased to receive a complimentary
issue of the Davidsonian. It was one
of the few times I have ever read it
from beginning to end! Even though
the subscription price is the same as a
seven-month subscription to Play-
boy, you can count me as a sub-
scriber.

One of the articles in your first
edition covered a very controversial
topic, the yearbook. It seems strange
to me that during my four years at
Davidson, I could count on finding a
copy of the Davidsonian at my door,

week after week, (I might add that
even when I'spent my junior year
abroad in France I had some belated
access) yet during that same period
only two yearbeaks were published.
Granted, one edition of the yearbook
is a lot more complicated and time-

consuming than one edition of the
paper. However, if one edition of the
paper should fail to make deadlines,
the paper does not roll over and play
dead.

Granted also, the yearbook is a
one-shot deal, and past late editions
must eventually be accounted for.
However, this itself is a strong
argument that steps must be taken to
prevent the present situation from
even happening again.

The simple fact is that the 1975
editor had too much power in his
hands. His only incentive was that
we, the students, were expecting a
yearbook. 3

What is needed is some coordina-
ting body that assures all campus

Let this sink in.

These’ days a blood transfusion
that's given to save a life can cause
a death.

Because. Though there are
manyreputable commercial blood
banks, blood from commercial
sources is, unhappily, ten times
more likely to be the cause of
hepatitis than is blood from The
American Red Cross and other
community blood banks that
depend upon volunteer blood
donors.

Shocking? Of course.

So, you ask, why doesn't all
blood in American hospitals come
from volunteer donors?

Answer:

A mere three percent of all

Americans are donating one-
hundred percent of all the
blood that’s freely given in
America. It’s not enough.

So, you see, if'youré healthy, fit
our easy criteria for donors, and
yet don't give blood regularly —
well, youre part of the blood
scandal in America.

By default.

One more thing: if you think
the Red Cross “gets money” for
the blood you donate, youre
wrong. The only charge that's
ever made is to help meet the
cost of processing the blood.

So call the Red Cross — then roll
up your sleeves. Please.

and well.

entralization of publications urged

publications run smoothly. However,
I do not believe that student publica-
tions should be taken out of student
hands entirely. The ideal situation
would be a centralized publishing
house on campus that can handle all
publications, including the Wildcat
Handbook, the Davidsonian, the
Davidson Update, Quips and Cranks,

The Miscellany, the catalog and -

publicity brochures. Such an entity
would leave autonomy to the indivi-
dual publications in policy and mate-
rial, but would act as a supervisor and
coordinator. More specifically, why
not put all publications under the
same roof and invest in printing
equipment that all could share? Of
course, this initial investment would
be great, but eventually it would save
money. It is always the first step that
costs.

The efficiency of this system has
two tremendous advantages: (1)

To the Editor:

I did not cast a vote for Belk dorm
senator. It was not out of protest, or
even apathy. I went to the post office
to pick up a ballot and vote. Scanning
the list of names, I only recognized
one.

Was I out when all the prospective
senators came knocking at my door to
get my vote? Were they too shy to put
up campaign statements in our bath-
room? Only one person put up
posters, and these posters said
nothing.

I wonder about senators who are
too busy to campaign, and especially
I wonder about a senate which is

in their duty. (2) The cooperation
among the various publications would

‘prevent time-consuming repetition

and ease organization. For example,
the pictures that go in the Davidson-
ian, Quips and Cranks, and -the
Update would all be within an arm’s
length. The class pictures in the
yearbook could be assembled in
fraternity composites and thus make
money themselves. There would not
be a series of middlemen, and of
course no publishing for profit. The
advertising for the newspaper and for
basketball brochures could be central-
ized. The list goes on forever.

There certainly is enough publish-
ing done on campus to make such a
venture worthwhile. If the right
people are found to manage it (a staff
of both students and professionals),
and if the financing could be found, I
firmly believe the results would be
admirable.

elected in this way.

Here is my theory. No true demo-
cracy can operate in this way, so all of
these senators are communists. These
people, assisted by others already in
the senate, will be in the majority by
the next meeting. All of our senate
money will be funneled into Moscow:
the sickle and hammer will be taken
out of someone’s bottom drawer and
displayed proudly in the senate
offices; then certain students will
start disappearing...

Well Davidson, you can breathe
easily for a while yet.I think the
communists have reviews next week.

Facetious bomb threat

To the Editor:

I wish to thank those God-fearing,
peace-loving Christians who so ably
defended my freedom of will, my right
to choose and.plot my own course,
irregardless of what constellations’
may guide me.

Luckily, I, too, am a Christian and
recognize that the real issue is my
freedom of choice, not (as some have
mistakenly suggested) what options
exist for me to choose from. Thank
God that America has seen fit to
preserve mankind’s oldest and most
respected right- the right to keep and
bear arms in order to prevent

incursions upon my freedom of choice.

Thank God Americans have the
option to study war, to perfect the art
whereby we may destroy our race
more effficiently. Thank God that He
protects me with His almighty sword,
and not His inseparable love (Romans
8:38-39) since everyone knows you
can’t fight wars by turning the other
cheek (see what happened fo Neville
Chamberlain?).

We should be proud of those who
devote their lives to studying war,
risking their lives daily so we can
attend the church of our choice and
hear ‘‘Peace on Earth, geodwill
towards men’ and “‘love your

enemies’ on the Lord’s Day, or any

day we choose.

Of course feeding the hungry and
clothing the naked are worthwhile,
but since America and the West alone
are aware of this, we must maintain
our powerful armies to prevent the
domination of non-Christian powers
over such peace and freedom-loving
peoples as ourselves.

Why, look at Chile! Thank God
America intervened when she did, and
helped overthrow the savage,
repressive, totalitarian Allende
regime, one that completely denied
the dignity of man and his natural
freedoms, ‘and instituted instead the
liberating, emlightening and just
hand of the present military leader-

His ultimate gift to a wise and free
