J. M. WALKER GUEST
(Continued from rage 1)
The Woman at the Well
It was only by touching David's
sore spot that Nathan was able to
influence him, said Dr, Walker? In
just the same way, it was only by
reminding the “woman at the well”
that she had no real husband that
Jesus was able to convert her from
her harlotry to Christianity.
Then came David's confession,
open, complete, with no excuses, It
was hard for David to confess, but
it was his only way back to God.
The minister pointed out two im-
portant things about the confes-
sion: (1) That sin appears to the
Godly man as something warped,
twisted, and imperfect; and (2)
that the sin was not against Uriah,
Bathsheba, his children, and_ his
subjects, but against God. “Against
Thee and Thee only have I sinned
and done: this evil in Thy sight,”
said David. Said Dr. Walker, “You
have to go to’Calvary to realize
how heinous sin is in God's sight.”
That separated David from
God, and it was necessary for David
to realize, that before he could ask
God's forgiveness.

sin
