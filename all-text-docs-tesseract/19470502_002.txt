Chapel...

Despite past president bill MelLean’s
plea some tew weeks ago for more decor-
ous conduct in chapel, we are. still, it
seems to me, over-demonstrative in our
morning services. Phere isa time and place
for everything in the way ot good, clean
fun, and I, would be the last to decry the
humorous student body reaction to an-
nouncements ; but seriously, don’t you think
they're somewhat out-of place on the three
or tour days of each’ week when there are
guest speakers or members of the admin-
istration on the platform? :

Keep in mind that most of our guests

in chapel are here, often for the first time, !

to deliver a serious message, and they must
be a bit thrown off balance when their in-
troductions are preceded by several min-
utes of tom-foolery from us. Those speak-
ers who are Davidson alumni probably,
with a reminiscent mind, can at least un-
derstand our mass repartee; but imagine
yourself for a moment a visiting speaker
from, say, the University of Southern
California, You are on your way to New
York on a mission concerning the World
Student Leadership Movement, and at the
invitation of the Davidson College Pres-
ident, you ‘have stopped by the school on
a Monday morning to present the subject
closest to your heart to a thousand of the
world’s students. As they assemble be-
fore you, you remark to yourself that the
Davidson student body looks like a repre-
sentative cross-section Of the post-war
small college — no richer, no poorer, no
more frivolous, no more sober than any of
the many comparable groups you've seen.
Then, at a nod from the college president,
a young man on the front row rises and
begins reading announcements to the stu-
dent body. You are thinking what an ef-
ficient mode of transmitting news this is,
when suddenly a perfectly routine-sound-
ing declaration is made concerning some
organization called Sigma Upsilon — im-
mediately there rises a crescendo of
strange explosive responses, “Oop, oop,
oop,” increasing in pitch, and followed by
a general chuckle of self-approval from
the audience. You are-now available for a
Scabbard and Blade military ball; no
sooner_are these words out, than the air is
segmented by several hundred mock
swordsmen, accompanying their pantomine
by audible ‘“‘swishes.”” The laughter dies
down, the sttident leader is finally able to
finish the last announcements; as he sits
down, you hurriedly consider a last min-
ute revision to your address. You had
“come prepared to impress~on-the-students
of a noted small school the tremendous re-
sponsibility they face as leaders of tomor-
rows ‘nation and world. But now, almost
dismayed, you wonder if maybe your
weighty words will not be over their heads,
and they perhaps, if bored, will not get up
and walk out on you. You have a mission

through, you suddenly come to the heart-

squirming clock-watchers, you have the

student body president. Simply facing the
audience-that assembles in chapel each day
is task enough — we should not complicate
the job-of reading announcements by in-
attention and distracting rejoinders. The
chapel comedy is a good thing — it reflects,
I believe, a close-knit student spirit, but
we must employ a bit of discretion in its
use.

Letters To The Editor

*( Note :—Lecause of the editor’s desire to air
the current’ elections controversy, Lob Rier-
son’s feature appears on the back page of this
issue, )

Dear Editor ;-

Asa member of the forgotten class of voters,
1 would like to reply to the letter of Mr, Ed
Sutton, who attempted’ to refute the excellent
arguments presented previously by Mr. C.. A.
MeNair, '

By the “forgotten class of voters’ I mean those
of us who are not fortunate enough to have been
at Davidson for the three years that Mr. Sutton
gives as the time in which the prospective candi-
dates should have been campaigning for office.
Some day in the glorious future, | may rise to
the senior class, and then | hope to know the
record and qualifications for those for whom 1
cast my ballot.

3ut why should I have to wait a few years
before I can excerise my rights intelligently ? 1
must admit that before coming to Davidson 1
did not read the Davidsonian, and therefore-am
still quite a bit behind as to who's who. We fresh-
men number more than.a few head, and have too
many votes to be voting for so-and-so because
he is vaguely known by a friend's friend, or be-
cause he has a good old family name.

The least that could be done would be to run
the Davidsonian before election impartial
acheivements of each candidate, this account sery-
ing to enlighten those of us who have not been
around long enough tos enlighten ourselyes, I
admit that the ideal thing is to know personally
sach candidate, but since so many of us don't,
why can’t someone tell us about them, either by
speeches or by write-ups? :

Hopefully,

Dear__ Editor :-

I would like to congratulate Ed Sutton, emi-
nent sociologist, on the merit if his letter to the
Davidsonian in favor of our so-called closed
elections, Since he is serving on the elections
board, it is perfectly natural that he should de-
fend the system and see to it that the functions
are carried out according t6 its established polici-
es. But I feel it imperative to defend my position
and the position of the majority (according toa
recent poll) of the student body,

In answering my letter which favored some
type of open elections system, Mr. Sutton im-
plied that I was taking an absurd stand by saying
that our participation in national and minor civil
elections would be hampered: by the training that
\we do not receive in college. I would like to re-

and a.message, however, so you go ahead

fer you to a recent article in the Reader’s Digest

The Operating

CU UL

Table

With the advent of spring and
rising sap, our newly elected prexy,
one “FEERLESS HUGH” HILL
was off to GREENSBORO to meet
an enchantress there, who was to
have heen awaiting his coming to
take in the local matinee. On arri-
val, our hero found that the prin-
cess had been swept away by the
proprietor of a local flea circus
and had last been seen scratching
her way towards a secret rendez-
vous to meet the rogue. With a
nefarious gleam in his eye, our
hero stated that he had broken the
ill fated romancé and disposed of
half a can of D. D. T.

Most of this week’s undercover
work was done at the Salem fracas,
but unfortunately we can only tell
in part of operations in that sec-
tor if we wish for our beloved editor
to remain in this here institution.
It seems that in spite of his speed
on the cinder path, GENE BING-
HAM was unable to kick up enough
dust at Winston and was trapped.
On the other hand BIG BILL
JOHNSON and his 200 pounds of
bone and muscle was reported to
have drawn a veritable Venus ex-
cept for the unfortunate fact that
this maiden had arms which kept
Sir William at bay for the eve-
ning. Other members of the

smarter social set drawing lovelies
were Betas CAL SCHMIDT and
FRANK LEMMON who entertained
the fair damsels with many cho-
ruses of “Hail to Wooglin” and
feasted on dog liver between re-
frains, All parties attending Salem
festivities report a wonderful time
after about two hours when one
of our F. B. I. aspirants came
through with maps and data which
relieved much of the early tension.

Letters To Editor Con’t-

(.\pril 1947 issue) in which Mr,
H, Gallup, Director,

Institute Public
Opinion, says that one of the two
dhief things responsible for the
general lack of interest in our
national elections is, “that our
schools and colleges fail to give
even a rudimentary knowledge
of the workings of their own
government and fail to arouse
interest in public affairs.” 1 will
leave the obvious conclusion to

in his case.

evidently, Mr. Sutton did not
notice that in the same issue as
my letter appeared that an article
Was printed in which 75% of the

student body prefers some change

in the elections system. This to
me is an indication that there is
certainly a change desired in the
minds of the students even if it
is only temporary to correspond
to the increased size of the stu-
dent boty. But if Mr. Sutton did
read the article, however, I take
it as an indication that he favors
the minority rule.

In conclusion, Mr. Sutton cites
an example of a college at which
the principal offices are held by
social fraternity men, implying
that the same would happen if
we were to adopt theopen SYS-
tem. On this point I merely want
to say that if it did happen on
this campus—as—a result of the
open system, that it would be an
indication of failure on the part
of the-college to instill in its
students the rudiments and func-
tions of the principles which it
so effectively teaches; How else,
other than actual practice, can
the success of its teachings be in-
dicated? By refusing’ to put them
into’ the situation for which they
are intended?

Respectfully,
Champ MeNair. -

bared his cussed cranium to the

barber’s shears, while the fair
“Grecian” woed his fair maid ’neath
a waning purity light up at the big
blue school. Social-climbing Sam
Tate led most of the lads up to

grace over the peas, carrots, string
beans, and squash at the “boo’’-fet
supper. On the gamboling greens
of Salem were Brothers Willing-
ham, who holds down a mean sec-
ond; Cobb, who held his own in
the shaded interior of the Big
Blue; Starnes, who finally got that
redhead to talk. She said, “I’m
hungry”; Hollister, who kept ‘the
lovely Page right busy during, in-
termission; Hills, who kept things
loose as a greased goose, snaking
on the brethren with his winning
way; and Bobby Long, who, con-
trary to all prevalent rumors, was
not hit in the mouth with a tomato.
Frank Hooper apparently got side-
tracked and wound up in the gym
with a little girl from the junior
school at their final dance. Her-
bert Miller pursued his Unitarian
studies’ in earnest and endeavored
to increase his wide radius.

In a recent exclusive interview
with representatives of the David-
sonian, socially insignificant organ
of the Phillips purity league and
temperance society, retired chap-
ter president Bob Crowell an-
nounced, “Having cut only a rela-
tively small number of times this
semester, I plan to take off to the
beach this week end and make up
for lost time. It is my intention
to spend as much time as possible
snaking on the dates of everybody
with whom I am acquainted. It is
my belief that training received
during service experience will be
of invaluable aid in this effort.”

Brother Campbell received a
great big smile of approval from
both Professor Blackburn of Duke
University and chapter president
Murdock McKiethan for winning
second prize of $0.00 in the Vereen
Bell Memorial Award Contest for
excellence in creative writing.
Stated author Campbell: ‘The
money means nothing to me. I
write for the pure joy of creating
personalities. I especially enjoy
making female characters.” Best
wishes of the entire chapter go with
Brother Campbell in future creative
endeavors,

Homer Ragan insists that state-
ments made in last week’s column
be retracted. Either he wants it

nothing, I forget which.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON
Things were sorta quiet at the
Sig-Ep lodge this past week but
one might ‘add that.Marty (better
known as “Snags’’) Pitts is now
the bicycle boy. He is what you
might call a “wheeler.” Bill Plonk

was all excited Sunday nite over at
the Presbyterian church in Char-
lotte. It must have been one of
the near-by Queens lassies who
gave him the sudden frustration.
Most of the brethren are making
all sorts of plans for summer vaca-
tion. We have everything from
beachcombers to Canadian explor-
ers. Furman, Barr, and Davis in-
vaded Salem and came back with
news of a big time.

Congrats! to Parson Ed who is
showing up as one of the finest
hurdlers in school and is one of
the» highest scorers on the track
team. The Taylor twins took over
Spartanburg but details were _in-
complete at the time of writing but
it would suffice to say someone
was Snafu.

BETA THETA PI

The Beta house was practically
deserted this week end with most
of the brothers enjoying the festivi-
ties at Salem. Unconfirmed rumor
has it that Brother “Hot Lips”
Crane lost his pin recently. Brother
Earl Groves was spotted trying the
back seat of his new Buick for size.
Other brothers whose names are
not available enjoyed a pleasant
evening out at the “cabin” and were
noticeably absent from the dance.

Plans are under way for the
spring dance next week end at the
Charlotte Woman’s Club, with Billy
Knauff and his orchestra. Friday
night there will be a barbecue on
the campus, and brothers are en-
couraged to plan their own enter-
tainment for the evening. Satur-
day night there will be a banquet
and dance.

New officers for next year have
been elected and are as follows:
President, Al Scarborough; vice
president, Bill Joyner; secretary,
and rush chief, Dave Shepperson;
treasurer, Vincent Long; Pan-Hell
representative, Frank Rawley.

nounce ‘the pledging of Walter

A fine excuse for a most enjoyable
function, for which thanks to Bill
Calhoun, was provided last week
on the occasion of a visit from
members of Alpha Tau chapter, of
Sigma Chi from the University of
North Carolina. An excellent feed
was enjoyed by all at Erwin lodge
and it is reported that Miller,
though far behind in the hot dog
consumption race now holds the
ham devouring prize. Efforts of
Treasurer Rodney Whisnant to
liven up the otherwise calm and
collected meeting sessions are bear-
ing fruit now—three brothers faint-
ed last week when the “Which -
would - you - rather -.do - or - pay -

was overheard to say that he wished
that he had been born rich instead
of so darned handsome. This pro-
vided an occasion for speculation:

want to miss this Dorsey story. In

about whom no comment is needed.
Humor, beauty, and the other nec-

This is an historical film of po-

Rogers steals the whole show as
she defends pure democracy in the

the historical background of the
