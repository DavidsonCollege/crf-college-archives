Is the reunification of the two Germanies
possible? Bush wants aid to Panama

EAST GERMANY: As written
in a recent New York Times ar-
ticle, the emergence of a multi-
party system in Eastern Europe
has resulted in confusion.
Under the one-party system of
the past 40 years “everything
was politicized, except for poli-
tics which was depoliticized.”
The East European people
were molded into a certain
mindset that was not condu-
cive to politics. Now “after 40
years of one-party rule, the
basics of Parliamentary proce-
dure need tobe learned all over
again.” The opposition parties
have found it easy to criticize
the Communist party but
harder to put their opinions
into policy once they have
gained power; their rapid
emergence and growth has
made it difficult for them to
keep track of their platforms

and goals.

Recent developments in East
Germany illuminate these
problems of establishing new
democratic systems. Eleven
parties have emerged in recent
months torival the Communist
Party; West German political
parties are using the upcoming
elections as a battleground for
the .reunification question.
Elections were set for May 6but

were moved ahead by two
months to March 18 in light of
mounting civil unrest that
threatens to divide the nation.

East Germany’s political
changes have also opened up
new opportunities for eco-
nomic restructuring. Last week
Christ Luft, the East German
Economics Minister, an-
nounced that the government
will allow majority ownership
by foreign investors of busi-
nesses with 500 employees or
less, while a 49 percent cap will
exist for larger companies so
that a “wholesale buy out” by
West Germany will not occur.
This plan isan effort to gain the
foreign capital necessary to
modernize the Eastern Bloc
nation, and Western econo-
mists estimate that East Ger-
many will need $295.4 billion
to do so.

West German officials be-
lieve that the lifting of these
restrictions and implementa-
tion of other radical reforms

should lead to German coop-"

eration with currency; as cited
by The Wall Street Journal, one
Bundesbank official envisions
a monetary union before the
two Germanies resolve their
political division. East German
Officials are not so optimistic.
The federal government in
Bonn will continue to.push for
such unifying measures for the

long-term interests of both
states; Western officials believe
that a monetary cooperation
will put an end to the huge
immigration from East to West
that could lead to economic
collapse for East Germany. A
recent poll conducted by the
University of Bochum in West
Germany showed that most
immigrants are leaving for
economic rather than political
reason.

Erich Honecker, former
leader of East Germany, was
arrested Monday for high trea-
son. Honecker was taken from
a hospital directly to prison.

US/CHINA: The U.S. House of
Representative’s recent over-

‘riding of the presidential veto

of a bill protecting Chinese
students was cancelled by the
Senate’s failure on Friday by
four votes to reach a two/
thirds majority. The bill, which
protected Chinese students
from deportation from the U.S.
by waiving the requirement
that they return to China for
two years after the expiration
of their visas, was vetoed by
President Bush in November.
The President claims that he
will protect any Chinese stu-
dent returning to Beijing but
“insists on a free hand in shap-
ing relations with Beijing.” The
issue rapidly became a bipar-

san struggle with the Republi-
cans siding with Bush and the
Democrats seeing the vote asa
chance not only to criticize the
President for his policy butalso
asa way todirectly “bash” him.
The sharp response to the vote
by China’s Foreign Ministry
spokesman surprised even the
Republicans. It was one of the
fiercest anti-American
speeches to be released from
China in recent months.

US/PANAMA: On Friday
President Bush announced
that the US would provide
Panama with $1 billion in eco-
nomic aid. The package in-
cludes cash, loans and humani-
tarian assistance to the-nation
that has suffered up to $2 bil-
lion in general economic strife
and physical damages from the
US. invasion last month.

The offer came after a task
force led by Deputy Secretary
of State Lawrence Eagleburger
visited Panama to assess its
economic situation. The U.S.
government has also released
about $140 million Panama-
nian assets that were frozen as
sanctions against now deposed
General Manuel Noriega, and
it will release another $250 mil-
lion soon.

U.S./US.S.R.:For the first time
arms negotiators agreed to al-

low inspections of the opposite
country’s warheads. This
movement is viewed as a way
of accelerating work on the
arms control treaty currently
being negotiated between the
US. and US.S.R. in Vienna.

WESTERN EUROPE: A fierce
winter storm ripped through
Southern England and four
continental countries, killing
62 people. With winds of 110
mphs and torrential rains, the
storm disrupted traffic, school
and communication.

JAPAN: Last week the Japa-
nese government, under the
auspices of the Institute for
Space and Astronautical Sci-
ence, launched a moon-orbit-
ing satellite that will provide
data on temperatures and elec-
trical fields. The Muses-A proj-
ect is an attempt by the Japa-
nese to build up its space tech-
nology, and if successful it will
make Japan the third nation in
the world to have this specific
launch capability. Though Ja-
pan’s space budgeting is only
one tenth of that for the US, it
has lined up several different
cooperative ventures for the
next few years. These include
sending a payload specialiston
a US. shuttle flight and a TV
journalist to the Soviet Mir
space station.
