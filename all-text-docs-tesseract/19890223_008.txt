Wednesday night, in the second
to last game in cozy Johnston
Gym, the Wildcats played proba-
bly their best game of the season
in a 65-63 heartbreaking loss to
Miami of Ohio.

The Redskins crept back,
however by an outstanding per-
formance from Tim Stewart who
scored 19 points in the first half,
15 of which came off 3-pointers.
Despite a Alan Hunter bomb from
40 feet, referee Lenny Wertz
tuled that the buzzer had sounded
before the ball left Hunter’s hand.
Miami led 37-34 at halftime.

Davidson and Miami matched

each other basket for basket but
by the five minute mark, the ghost
of missed shots plagued the Wild-
cats as they only scored four
points down the stretch. With :47
remaining, Mo Gray, who led
Davidson scoring with 19, was
fouled by Jeff Scott as he knocked
in a basket off the glass. Gray
missed the ensuing free throw,
and Miami took the rebound
down court. After running the
clock down to :16, Miamicalleda

As the clock resumed, the Re-.

dskins fumbled the play, but the
ball was saved from going out of
bounds by Tim Stewart. Stewart
threw to Jeff Scott who was posi-
tioned under the basket for an
easy two. Two seconds remained.

In reference to Davidson’s final
play, coach Hussey said, “Our
idea was to get the ball to half
court and then call time out, but
it’s hard to score at the distance.”

“We had a chance to win it,”

Hussey continued. “I thought they
got an extremely lucky break.”

FOOTNOTES:

Senior Andy Nilsson, the Wild-
cat mascot, joined the team on the
bench rather than cheering on the
side lines this week. Nilsson
broke his leg atlast Wednesday
night’s game while performing

the traditional rope stunt. As he
swung from the rope onto the
court, Nilsson’s hands slid too far
and he landed hard onto the floor.
Nilsson will wear a cast for four
weeks.

A Johnston Gym memory

By LARRY DAGENHART

It was the only game Skip Brown would ever start
for Davidson. The 1982-83 version of the Wildcat
basketball team had five seniors, four of whom
started while Brown sat on the bench, until tonight.
It was senior night, their final home game in
Johnston Gym.

It was acold Saturday nighton February 19, 1983,
and Davidson was geared up foracrucial conference
battle with UT-Chattanooga, who had that week en-
tered the Top 20 at number 20.

Johnston Gym was jammed. The seniors were
playing their final game; people were lined up up-
stairs behind the railing; people were sitting along
the sidelines and some, like myself, were crammed
into a corner. A win tonight against nationally
ranked Chattanooga would give Davidson needed
confidence for the upcoming Southern Conference
tournament.

The student side was ready to go. As the Wildcats
took the floor for their warm-up, the whole house
rose and clapped in unison to the fight song. There
was electricity in that gym.

As a follower of Davidson basketball, I knew that
Skip Brown rarely played; but this was senior night

and Hussey gave him the start. Brown, 6'-11" and -

lanky as could be, was the last starter introduced and

the students, with whom Brown was a favorite, went
crazy.

Yes, Brown was getting his “token start” but that”
was not his attitude. Brown did not even jump center
but he was soon to be the star. As Davidson won the
tap, it was like Chattanooga was afraid to guard
Brown. They left him alone at the top of the key and
when he got the ball, he let it fly from 15 feet—
swish. Pandemonium. I had never heard Johnston
Gym so loud. What amazed me even more-was that
he canned two more from about the same place. He
even got a tip-in after a missed shot. No one could
believe it. Brown, the eternal reserve, got eight big
points in a crucial game. At the fourteen-minute
mark, Brown was taken out of the game. to the
loudest standing ovation the gym may have ever
heard. I thought the roof was going to cave in right
there.

From my spotin the corner on the floor; Isaw UT-
Chattanooga beat Davidson 73-71 ona lastsecond 3-
pointer in one of the most exciting basketball games
I have ever seen. It was an expected win for Chat-
tanooga but a heartbreaking loss for Davidson. In a
gym that has seen 11 undefeated seasons, the Lefty
Driesell era and even a'59-game winning streak from
1962-1971, Davidson’s game with Chattanooga will
most likely go unremembered. But I’ll bet Skip

Saturday’s six-hour ride back
from Atlanta seemed even longer

freshman Chris Clark joined the
other three on the trip. Clark and
Buss wrestled one match each
while Binns and Farmer both
encountered two grueling
matches. As Binns and Clark

conceded in agreement, “We got.

But light finally shed on the de-
termined Davidson wrestlers last
Wednesday night. They met
Gardner-Webb in Boiling Springs

Brown won’t forget.

Wrestlers whip Webb

and came home victorious in itive
out of six matches. They not only
defeated their opponents, they
also embarrassed them.

Captain Joé Binns wrestled at
the 142 and 150 pound weight
classes: He won both matches
with scores of 14-5 and 13-5.
Binns walked away with 14 out of
20 team takedowns. At 158 and
167, Chris Clark shut out one
opponent with six points and
manhandled the other 17-3. Eric
- Farmer pinned his man at 190, but

- Jost the second match in the

heavyweight class.

Last Wednesday night’s victo-
ries gave the Cats the boost they
were looking for all year long.

In retrospect, the wrestling
team started with misfortune
which amplified as the season
progressed. An unusually large

number of long-term injuries.

spread throughout the lineup.
Nerves were endangered from

neck and back problems, Liga-

ments tore as a result of hyperex-
tended knees and stretchéd feet.
Bones were broken from: unac-

Consequently, only four wres-
tlers lasted the whole season. The
decreasing number not only af-

fected the morale of the team, but
also made daily practices very
difficult. Heavyweight Eric
Farmer usually had no one ‘to
work with. Practicing with lighter —
weight wrestlers meant he con-
stantly had to hold back and not
go 100%. Conversely, a light
weight usually wrestled defen-
sively, not being able to improve
on his offensive moves.

Individually, each wrestler had
a brighter outlook: Buss felt glad
to have finished the season. Clark
cited the same, “I guess it was a
major accomplishment ‘(to do
so).” Binns emphasized on the
wrestlers who “stuck it out,” the
type who came to practice spit-
ting blood along with the sweat.
“You’ve got to hand it to them,”
said junior Wade Heinrichs who
had one more week before his
ankle cast could be removed. a4
