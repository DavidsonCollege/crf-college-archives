The ‘third member of the
affice is its secretary, Mrs.
Nancy Blackwell, who has
been the continuing element
of ithe office for 25 years. Ac-
cording to Arbuckle and
Long, she Knows more about
Davidson alumni tian the
college computer.

Despite its talents, the
“umn staff has tad its
problems, as Arbuckle mreal-
izes. ‘‘We know that we are
far from being above criti-
cism. There are a lot of
ways in which alumni rela-
tions at Davidson could be
improved, \and we recognize
this.

“It’s ridiculous to say that
we have an excellent pro-
gram, because tthere is much
improvement that dan be
done. I dike ‘to think ‘that
alunyni: relations are growing
and that we're miaking at-
tempts to improve them,
however."’

One of the greatest criti-
cisms of the Office of Alum-
ni Activities is that its or-
ganization does not allow for
a full use of students and
faculty in relations with
alumni. There are many
ways, the arguments 99, in

bers. Students are ‘‘stnongly
urged”’ to attend these class-
es ito provide alumni with
different perspectives on the
miaiters discussed.

The ‘annual Alumni Lunch-
eon, at which‘all seniors are
guests of the alumni, willl be
held on ithe front lawn of the
campus at 1 p.m. Students

to attend miay purchase a

Dedication of tihe new Sen-

cording to Arbuckle, some

pany the dedication.

Athletic contests in foot-
ball and tennis will pitt, the
present varsity teams against
a collection of alumni play-
ers at 3 p.m: Among those
playing for the alumni will
be Steve Heckard '65 of the
Los Angeles Rams, Neill Mc-

Lenoir-Rhyne), Sandy Carne-

sophomore at Davidson), and

‘Russell Walls ’64 (now a psy-

chology professor on the fac-

which students and faculty
could exchange views with
alumni and ‘‘take the col-
lege’ to these former stu-
dents.

‘‘We feel the necessity of
using students and faculty in
our alumni programs, and
we're beginning to institute
programs enabling us to
make ‘full use of these cam-
pus resources,'’ Long said ‘in
response to this argument.

““We've begun to use stu-
dents ‘and professors in our
regional alumni meetings
regularly this year to Jet the
alumni hear from those here
at Davidson now just what's
going on iat the college. We
plan ito use students much
more in future alumni pro-
grams, iif ‘the: students show
any interest."

Arbuckle echoed Long, em-
phasizing that the students
now at. Davidson, even if
they don't graduate from

ape, become Davidsen alum.

Another criticism of the
Davidson alumni program is
that it does not make good
use of the college’s-atumni,
and that it has not organ-
ized the alumni into any sort
of strong, cohesive group.

According to Long, howev-
er,.in some areas Davidson
has an ‘‘active core group of
alumni... We're still building
alumni groups, however. We
are not meaching everybody
yet, we know."’

This year, under . Long's
direction, the alumni office
‘sponsored over 50 area ‘alum-
ni meetings across tthe coun-
ttry. .“'We isimply wanted to

‘ inform ialumni tabout David-

son, to hear from them their
responses, to seek their -sup-
port, and above alll to bring
them together as Davidson
alumni,’’ Long said.

A third criticism of David- .
son’s alumni program is that
of money. y. In a time of finan-
cial woes, there are many as-
sociated with the college who
feel that the alumni office
should be able to solicit
much of the money that is
needed.

Arbuckle, who ‘heads the
Annual Fund Drive, pointed
out that ithe talumni office
has almost reached its goal
for financial contributions

for the year, however.

The purpose of ithe banquet

Arbuckle expressed hope
that students would actively
involve themselves in tthe ac-
tivities of the weekend and
thereby assure iits success.
In summary he said, ‘It's
something new,’ and indeed
it is,
