been attained at these social gather-

The

finest tobaccos
—only the center
leaves

The very heart of Lucky Strike’s
fine quality is choice tobaccos—
ripened by warm sunshine, rich
soils and gentle rains. Right now,
up to $100,000,000 worth of fine
Turkish and Domestic tobaccos,
the Cream of the Crop, are aging
and mellowing for the makers of
Lucky Strikes. For only a special
selection of choice tobaccos is used
in making your Luckies so round,
so firm and fully packed—free from
loose ends. The reason why Luckies
are always the same in mildness,
smoothness, in delicious taste.
