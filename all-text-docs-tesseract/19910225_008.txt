Let s Have A More
Flexible Ticket Policy

By Will Canu ’94 and
Jennifer Humphrey ‘94
Life shouldn’t be so complex.

Why can’ tadults open child-proof
bottles? Why do small people wear
extra-large shirts? What are Um-
bros made of? Why do you park in
a driveway and drive on a park-
way? Why does D.A. Thompson
whine about school spirit and not
attend games? Well, maybe we
can answer that last one .. . Could
it be the ticket policy?

Maybe D.A. went to the ticket
office to get a ticket a day after all
friends gi oten their seats. To his
great dismay his seat was in a dif-
ferent section, a differnt row, and
mightas well have been ina differ-
ent country. Weighing the deci-
sion of either cheering alone in the

though they would have to arrive a
bit early. But perhaps this crew
likes to be fashionably late? They
could still be together if they
planned ahead and obtained the
tickets for the seats in the firstthree
rows that would remain reserved
seating. With the frist three rows
of the student section remaining
reserved, diehard basketball fanat-
ics would still have the option to
get up before dawn to obtain these
coveted seats to see eyeball to
eyeball with Pat Holloway.

What would make this dream
complete? How about allowing
each student to be able to pick up
ten tickets instead of only five.
After all, five tickets is only two
couples and a fifth wheel, while
ten makes an even five.

How about allowing each student to be able to
pick up ten tickets instead of only five.

midst of apathetic students brood-
ing over their schedule for the week
or snuggling up to a bag of micro-
wave popcorn and a_brewski
(unavailable at Baker during events
under NCAA regs), D.A. decided
that he didn’t want to be a loner in
public and went for the popcorn.

Has something like this ever
happened to you?

Maybe if D.A. could have sat
with his friends he would have
attended the game, but the current
ticket policy restricted this would
be avid supporter. This problem
can be circumvented if the student
section was made to be general
admission (i.e. first come, first
serve seating). By this process, it
would not matter when a student
got their ticket, they could still
rally for the Cats with their friends.
Imagine the ease of cruising into
the game with your buddies and
sitting wherever there was room,
but knowing you would be to-
gether.

So, your’re a popular student,
similar to our bud D.A., and you
have, oh say, fifty friends. With
dates (a.k.a “Social Function”),
general admission would allow
even this crowd to sit together,

But wait! D.A. has friends that
don’t goto Davidson - lots of them.
Every now and then they like to
visit to catch a good basketball
game. Now, it just doesn’t seem
polite to make them pay $6 for a
bleacher seat! All students have
ten guest passes on their ID to
bring guests into Baker Sports
Complex (a $5 value). Might we
use these passes for basketball
games? It surely would be nice, but
this is far too simple for the elabo-
rate structural regulations of the
Davidson ticket office. (aren’t we
paying those guys?)

To change the current ticket
policy from reserved seating to
general admission (save the first
three rows) and to allow guest
passes to be used for basketball
tickets is worth the effort. This
will encourage souls like D.A. to
leave the popcorn in the dorm and
go cheer on his team. Just these
adjustments to the ticket policy
will make getting tickets less of a
hassle thereby making life just a
little less complex.

A Collection Of Quotations:
Western Thought And War

Again, we haven’t gone crazy.
If you can figure it out, this collec-
tion of quotes represents a distilla-
tion of human thought and emo-
tion in the face of some pretty com-
plex societal issues. We support
the prosecution of this war; if we’re
there, we had better get the job
done.

But killing people

itself to itself relates itself to an-
other.”
Soren Kierkegaard

“Strange is our situation here
upon earth. Each of us comes fora
short visit, not knowing why, yet
sometimes seeming to divine a
purpose. ..there is one thing we do

impossible to carry out. YetI keep
them, because in spite of every-
thing I still believe that people are
really good at heart. I simply can’t
build up my hopes ona foundation
consisting of confusion, misery,
and death. I see the world gradu-
ally being turned into a wilderness,
I hear the ever approaching thun-
der, which will destroy

for any reason, and es-
pecially when a nation
collectively decides
such an action must be
taken, is sort of discon-
certing. So we took a
week (or maybe a little
less) to pick out some
people and ideas we feel
reflects the profound
sadness with which an
honorable nation must
necessarily approach
war.

yet, if [look up into the

and peace and tranquil-

“Here I stand; I can do none

Martin Luther

“...wecan not dedicate—we

men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it

. . itis for the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished

“For I know that my redeemer
liveth, and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth . . . and
though worms destroy this body,
yet in my flesh shall I see God.”

Job 19:25-26

“Sir, when did we ever see you

“Cry for the broken tribe, for

“Never shallI forget that night,
the first night in camp, which has
turned my life into one long night,
seven timescursed and seven times
sealed. Never shall I forget that
smoke. Never shall I forget the
little faces of the children, whose
bodies I saw turned into wreaths of
smoke beneath a silent blue sky . .
. Never shall I forget these things,
even if 1am condemned to live as
long as God Himself. Never.”

Elie Wiesel

“Tts really a wonder that I
haven’t dropped all my ideals,
because they seem so absurd and

color, or odor. Without
atrace. I think that world literature

has it within its power in these
frightening hours. . . to communi-
cate the condensed experience of °
one region to another in sucha way
that we will cease to be split apart
and our eyes will no longer be
dazzled, the units of measurement
on our scales of value will corre-
spond to one another, and some
peoples may come to know the
true ‘history of others ‘accurately
and concisely and with that per-
ception and pain they would feel
[as] if they had experienced it
themselves~and thus be protected
from repeating the same errors.”
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

“The American is anew man,
who acts upon new principles; he
must therefore entertain new ideas,
and form new opinions . .. Here
individuals of all nations are melted
into a new race of men, whose
labors and posterity will one day
cause great changes in the world."

St. Jean de Crévecoeur

“We know through painfulex-
perience that freedom is never
voluntarily given by the oppres-

"sor; it must be demanded by the

oppressed .. . If the inexpressible
cruelties of slavery could not stop
us, the opposition we now face will
surely fail. We will win our free-
dom because the sacred heritage of
our nation and the eternal will of
God are embodied in our echoing
demands.”

Martin Luther Kings Jr.
