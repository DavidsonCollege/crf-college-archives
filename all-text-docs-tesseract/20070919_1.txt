Alumni flock back

to

beloved alma mater

Staff Writer and News Editor

Over the weekend, alumni
walked, ran and stumbled. their
way around campus, attending the
football game and parties at their
former fraternities and eating hous-
es. While upperclassmen rejoiced
to see their old friends return from
the real world to the Davidson bub-
ble, underclassmen were under-
standably less gregarious with the
alums.

Who are these people who love
Davidson so much that they fly
back from all over the country for
Homecoming Weekend? What do
they do now? What have their
Davidson educations done for
them?

Some alumni _ graciously
answered these questions for The

Davidsonian, when our reporter
could catch them.

“Now J am a deputy district.

attorney out in California,” Erica
Schwartz ’02 said, “so I’m a prose-
cutor. I’m a lawyer; Pm a grown
up.”

Schwartz is proof that the so-
called Davidson mafia network is
alive and well, with graduates
always willing to help out a fellow
Wildcat.

“At the end of senior year I con-
tacted a bunch of alumni,” she said.
“J actually took a year off and
worked for a judge while I applied
to law school and then went to law
school the next year. For me it was
a pretty easy transition. I felt like I
needed a year to get things organ-
ized and stuff.”

Policy Forum invites public discourse

By Monica JaMOUNEAU
News Editor

An Academic Policy Forum was
held last week to discuss issues
such as the changed pass/fail
option and the concern about possi-
ble grade deflation at Davidson.
Meikaela Zwieryznski °10 began
the meeting with approximately 15
students, although a few more stu-
dents arrived toward the end of the
discussion.

Colby Uptergraft °09 and
Whitney White 08 also managed
the meeting. Zwieryznski,
Uptergraft and White serve as stu-

dent representatives on the Student
Academic and Educational Policy
Committee as well as on the
Educational Policy Committee of
the Faculty.

The forum began with a discus-
sion of core requirements for grad-
uation. Some students believe that
for non-majors, the core require-
ments in mathematics and the sci-
ences, as well as philosophy and
religion, are too demanding. The
rigor of the classes has deterred
some students from taking them,
one forum attendee said.

“The Mathematics and Science
Departments do a good job of

offering non-major classes,”
Lindsay Kallman ’10 said, “but the
English Department does not. This
often deters students from taking
introductory classes in English.”

The writing course requirement
can be completed through almost
any department, not only English.
There are chemistry, French and
religion “W” courses available to
fulfill the core requirement.

A discussion on the pass/fail
option and the changes to it last
year took up much of the meeting.
White said that if upperclassmen
had the option of the new pass/fail,
which is a retroactive choice of
three pass/fail classes at the end of
a student’s senior year, it would
require a huge amount of work by
the Registrar’s office.

Someone would have to go back
and count how many pass/fails
each student had taken and then
inform every student how many
pass/fails he or she had left.

“That would be a lot of work,”

White said. “Although, I personal-
ly don’t think that’s the best argu-
ment.”

At Johns Hopkins and MIT,

pass/fail, Zwieryznski said at the
meeting.

“Tt would lessen the incentive to
get good grades,” Kallman said,
but added, “It’s Davidson. You still
need to work hard. You can’t get
away with doing nothing and get a
C.”

Students also debated the expec-
tations and intentions of professors
in certain circumstances. White,
for example, asked attendees of the
meeting if professors expect a stu-
dent to read every page of reading
assigned to them.

“Are professors out of touch
[with students]?” White asked.

It can be difficult to switch from
studying Spanish to English to
math, one student said, questioning
whether professors understand the

Jena 6 and
racism at
Davidson

By ALISSA CURRAN AND
SUMMERLEE WALTER
Staff Writer and Editor-in-Chief

One year ago, a racially-based
“prank” sparked a race war in a
small Louisiana town, and now
ithe echoes of that event are rip-
pling across the nation, reaching
Davidson’s Black Student
Coalition in the form of a discus-
sion on Sept. 12. While many
choose to turn a blind eye to the:
racism still present in this coun-
try, the story of the “Jena 6” is
forcing Americans—including
Davidson students—to confront
the uncomfortable but critical
issue of racism.

In September, 2006, an
African-American freshman at
Jena High School in Jena, La,
asked the principal if he was:
allowed to sit under the “white
tree” in front of the school.
‘Unbeknownst to this freshman,
his question would be the catalyst
for ongoing warfare between
African-American and white stu-
dents.
| Traditionally, black students at
Jena sit in the auditorium, while
white students sit under the tree in
front of the school. The day after .
asking his fateful question, the’
freshman proceeded to sit under
the tree among the white students.
The next day, students arrived to
find three nooses in school colors
hanging from the tree. The mes-
sage could not have been clearer,
but, when the principal attempted
to expel the responsible students,
the superintendent intervened,
claiming the nooses were a.
“harmless prank.”

The district attorney, however,
was not so cavalier when it came
to pursuing punishment for six |
African-American students from |
the high school who beat a white
student after several instances of
