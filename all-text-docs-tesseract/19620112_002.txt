(All Unstgned Editorials by the Editor)

New Cut System: Maturity Unlimited

The meeting didn’t break up until
nearly 6 p.m., but out af it came a
major finished accomplishment. The
far-sighted group assembled was the
Davidson faculty, and the legislation
was a new cut system for the college.

It wasn’t long before the news
had spread around campus. The
thought of “unlimited cuts” excited
many, especially the freshmen. But a
second look at the new plan, to go into
effect next fall. shows several import-
ant ramifications. First, a reminder:
the “25 percent rule” is in effect right
now; no student can cut any course
more than nine times, excused or not
excused, without failing that course.
In effect, only the quality-point re-
quirement: has been removed.

But several new provisions have
shifted a larger burden of responsibili-
ty onto the student’s shoulders. In-
stead of only three cuts to handle, a
student will have nine (in most
courses) to parcel out for athletic,
musical ane other organizational trips,
and medical reasons. And since dean’s
office approval will be required before
any tests can be made up, it looks like
the days of the flimsy infirmary
“dive’’ are over at last.

A Private Yes

At its recent meeting, the faculty
voted once again on a resolution to
remove the racial restrictions govern-
ing Davidson admissions. Although
the result of the vote will not be an-
nounced until after the Trustee’s
meeting to which the resolution will
be. submitted. there can be no doubt.
that, in the light of previous ballots.
the motion was carried by a large
majority.

Indeed. neither the motion itself
nor its victory are so important as the
fact that it is “private’’ information
for the Trustees. The Faculty stand is
no longer revolutionary. it merely re
affirms the resolutions of years past.
It simplifies the complicated vote of:
five alternatives of two years ago to
a simple “yes.”

. The resolution is a private “yes”
to the Trustees because the heated
discussion, the agitation of past years
is now dormant. This is a year to
watch and wait. The first resolution
of the Faculty, the DAVIDSONIAN’S
Trustee Special Edition. the Congolese
Committee have done their job. Hav-
ing opened Davidson to Presbyterian-
approved Congolese, the Trustees
have shown that they desire to be fair
and reasonable, even Christian. Con-
sequently, the Faculty and other
campus groups have been willing to
give them time to consider—perhaps

‘to make Davidson's policies fairer.
‘more reasonable, more nearly Chris-

Agitation has made the Trustees
aware of the problem which exists, but
agitation would probably do little
more than irritate them at this time.
We hope, however, that this quiet,
considered reaffirmation of the inte-
grationist position by that campus
group which, unlike many of the
Trustees, is close to the Davidson sit-
uation and the academic world, and

Achilles?

The Union movie schedule for
the exam period, the selection which
has been brought to us in the previous
three semesters, and the plans for
the remainder of the year are proof
positive of the heroic interpretation of
Davidson history. Those of us who are
able to compare the excellent offer-
ings of the present with the grade-D
scum of former years will certainly
agree that history has been made. And
in this case, history has been made by
the hard work and devotion of one
man.

There are a few new restrictions,
too: no cuts will be permitted two days
before or after a vacation; professors
retain the right to make stricter cut
policies for their own classes, which
it is certain some will insist on doing.

But a new responsibility will fall
on professors, also. The ones who now
face nodding and indifferent classes
will find the back row absent instead
of asleep, unless dusty old lecture
notes are revised and new life inject-
ed. Those who make up lectures solely
on textbook material will probably
find many students preferring not to
hear the same old phrases. Certainly
the faculty dean ought to investigate
when he finds some classes which
most students cut to the hilt.

The new cut system, then, will
be on trial next year. The reaction of
the student body will be the measure
of its success. The faculty has taken
a brave step in giving nine cuts to all
students, regardless of class or scho-
lastic standing—a policy which is not
followed at many liberal schools. Un-
less the plan is successful, the student
body has every right to anticipate its

repeal.
D.B.S.

which is more mature, more objective
and better-informed than most of the
Students, will carry a very consider-
able weight.

The death of racial segregation at
Davidson began years ago when the
first Oriental student was admitted.
The position taken by the Presbyterian
Church has increased the pressure fo
integrate completely. Since the heat
following the 1953 Supreme Court de-
cision, many of the non-radicals in the
South have come to realize. if not
accept, the fact that public racial
segregation is doomed—again the
pressure on Davidson has been in-
creased.

Leading Southern universities
have already begun to revise their
policies. Votes such as a recent one
at Furman University (Faculty: 80-12
for integration, Students: 512-432 for
integration) have set the pace in South-
ern higher education. The admission
of Congolese was the reductio ad
absurdum of a system once valid but
now false. Finally, Davidson's decision
to become a leading national institu-
tion spells the death of this vestige of
regionalism.

The faculty has presented its case
to the Trustees, but the documentation
is incomplete. In its meeting Wednes-
day, the Student Council began a move
to fill the gap. The opinion of the stud-
ents should be submitted. as well. We
suggest that a simple ‘‘yes” or “no”
resolution be presented bv the Council
for student vote to give the Trustees
the student opinion.

For us, this is a year to watch and
wait, for we hope that the Trustees
will give a simple ‘“‘yes” to leadership
in the South. For the Trustees, we
hope it will be a year of decisive,
Christian action. LK

At the end of this examination
period, he stands a good chance of
becoming (like all true epic heros)
what some people might consider a
hero in tragedy. If he has underachiev-
ed, it is because he has done more in
threc semesters than most of us will
do in eight (or more). Signal evidence
of his devotion is the fact that he has
completed arrangements for the Fine
Film and Experimental Film Festivals
for the next semester before taking
his leave. As he goes, he carries with
him our thanks.

Professors Debate Over

Underachievement Cure

BY BILL HAGEN

Davidsonian Managing Editor

Underachievement—a __—prob-
lem or an opinion? And. if it
exists, how can it be detected
and what can be done about it?

To find the answers to these
and other questions concerning
the issue, raised by Dr. Puckett
on this page last month, THE
DAVIDSONIAN recently con-
ducted a vol! of the faculty. Al-
though replies were received
from only one-fifth of the facul-
ty (perhaps revealing the o‘her
side of the issue at stake) rcp-
resenting nine depar'ments. it
was felt that thev constituted a
cross section of opinion. ,

Practically all of h-s> polled
recognized the existence of the
problem and half admitted that
it was “ser’ous.” Serious enough
to constitute grounds for sus
pension most agreed.

In the minority was the pro-
fessor (one of two anonymous
replies) who, afler dispensing
with the “seriousness” of the
problem. stated that Dr. Puckett
was “all confused.”

Dear Editor,

Last month Davidson had the
opportunity to hear a fine artist.
Mr. Stewart Gordon, whil- not a
Name pianist (yet), showed him-
self to be a thorough master of
his instrument, and a sincere
interpreter of dcep musician-
ship. His program was a sur.
prisingly varied and most stimu-
lating one, and he played with a
like variety of sty!a- avd cffe-e
In short it was a most pleasant
and musically delightful eve-
ning.

It would have been much
more so had the audience been
larger. I hesitate t> pass judg-
ment, but it seems that quite a
few people could take time from
their studies to attend “The
Lovers” that was being shown
at the same time in the Union.
Most of these people could prob.
ably not spare the time other-
wise.

I shall not here go into the
grim possibility of the presence
of a culture ghetto here at Dav-
idson: I shall simply say that
it is amazing how little concern
for the concerts, lectures, ex-
hibits and the like is shown here
at a school supposedly well-
rounded and intellectual. Some-
times the level of clodhood
seems almost to approach that
of a state university. ..

HODSON EMPTY

But to Monday night’s con-
cert, for my real purpose is not
to condemn but to plead for
some sanity on the part of some-
body with authority. What im-
mutable law requires that con-
certs be given in Chambers? For
weeks we have been hearing the
delights of the Cunningham
Temple to the Muses re
and yet Hodson Hall sits empty
on the concert evenings. The
sometimes ravishingly fragile
tone of Mr. Gordon's Debussy
was lost in the acoustic night-
mare of Chambers.

Facilities seem worse in other
aspects—the spotlight went off
once during the performance,

Half of the professors said
that possibly % of their students
were slackers although there
was a distinct minority who put
the number at 15% or less. The
old adage of the ‘sophomore
slump” held up as an average
of 46% of the above under-
achievers was listed as belong-
ing to this class. The rest of the
average percentage places re-
served in this distinguished sec-
tion were divided equally by
the three remaining classes.

The probable number of sloth-
ful studiers in the student body

‘was roughly agreed upon as 10-

25%. About half of the dissen-
ters put the range under 10%
and the rest over 25%.
Obvious difficultics were en-
countered in the area of idgnti-
fying specific underachievers.
Solutions to the problem of
evaluating’ a student's perform-
ance with revard to huis ability
ranged from “can’t be done” to
proposals for a series of tests.
College boards, 1Q, and high
schoot grades were suggested
as helps. Several professors

seemed to think that only the
student himself could be abso-
lutely sure he was a slacker.
Consultations with the individ-
ual involved, and -possibly fel-
low students, were urged in
these cases.

The majority of the faculty
was willing to take on them-
selves the ultimate responsibili-
ty of deciding each case. The
Dean of Students or the Scholar-
ship Committee was also men-
tioned as tho possible final
authority.

The subject of what action to
take was an area of numerous
diverse opinions. One of the sug-
gestions was .that “teachers
should wake underachievers up:
with clubs, if necessary.” Again,
most of those polled. gave them-
selves the responsibility of try-
ing to cure the situation. Being
“less timid about failing” a stud-
ent was listed as a solution. One
professor even went so far as
to say that there would be “no
trouble with students if faculty
members did their own work—-
properly and on time.”

Goa Goads Discussion Of
~ Indian Political Attitudes

BY GEORGE DEY
Richardson Scholar

Americans have been quite surprised by the sudden

attack of Indian troops on

oa. For a clarification of this,

it will take some background and criticism. 7

India has diversity in every sense, whether political,
geographical, or cultural. It has three strong parties — 1.
Congressional, 2. Socialistic, and 3. Communistic. Demo-
cracy in India is very different from America and per-
haps has even lost its real meaning there. Many aspects
of the constitution are never practiced.

FREEDOM DRIVE

It has the second largest population in the world—
about 410 million people. America is very fortunate to
have three times as much area and also less population.

In India, with the expansion of education, the people
have pushed for more personal freedom. Because of the
unemployment situation, which seemingly disregards an
adequate education, they are reacting in the negative.
Communism was spreading rapidly in India because of

this economic situation.

REVOLUTION —
The country needs a big revolution to change the
political structure and in order to facilitate opportunities

for those who deserve them.

But population is a big prob-

lem which can never be solved. ;

The people are now of the revolutionary type. They
feel it at heart but can not put it into action. This em-
ployment question, without a doubt, would have changed
India completely toward socialism or communism but ‘for
the success of the two five year plans.

CIVIL ATTITUDE —

Average péople criticize and also dislike the pattern

of the government, because it changes from time to time.

Therefore all of its actions

must not be accepted as Te-

flecting the feelings or opinions of the people.

As to the attack of the

troops on Goa, many Ameri-

cans are surprised to learn the fact that it is not the
people who have brought this about. Average Indians
are not at all concerned about Goa. They are really much
more seriously concerned about China’ and Pakistan, who
are always flashing vreedv eyes on India.
GOVERNMENT CONTROL ;

It was mainly the command of the government which
brought Goa into the hands of India. The people did not
play. any active roll in having Goa made a part of their
country, though it was a question to be thought out by
the people. I think most citizens want only the opportun-
ity to see prospects of a rich future instead of Goa.

Much strong criticism, particularly in this country’s
newspapers, was brought about by this action. But the
reactive government has every Key which opens the door
and lets the “flv go out from Pandora’s Box.” Whether
India should be blamed or not for her role in this situation
is mostly a personal concept of each individual derived
from the complex background existing there.

Few of those polled thouaht it
necessary for the administration
take action except in ex'reme
eases. Academic probation,
limiting extra-curricular partici-
pation, and notification of oar-
ents were suggested though.

The members of the faculty
were anything but reluctant in
making gcneral comments or
specific suggestions concerning
the whole problem. Time spent
in extra-curricular activities and
allowing for special occasions,
such ag dance weekends, was

almost distracting Mr. Gordon
to what would have been a dis-
asterous interuption of the slow
movement of a Mozart sonata.
The doors were constantly har-
monizing with a dull. grating
creak that rarely failed to in-
trude on the pianissimos, some-
one in the balcony evidently had
a ptncil made of very slippery
wood—it rolled noisily down the
stairs several time.

Every whisper, cough, belch,
was megnifie? out of all just
proportion by the hideous acous-
tics. But worse of all is the dry,
cold, forbidding Chambers at-
mosphere—who can relax and
enjoy music in those chairs?
There is always a chilly edge to
the audience just from having
to sit in such a primitive audi-
torium.

ASKS ACTION

T should therefore like to ask:
what earthly reason makes it
impossible to use the new audi-
torium with its intiniate tonal
design, its relaxed and comfor-
table atmosphere, its easy-to-
get-along with feeling—so un-
like, that of Chambers, which
makes one feel vaguely antago-
nistic just by walking through
the door. How much finer Mr.
Gordon's excellent tone would
have been if it had not been
swallowed; how much better it
would have been to sit in com-
fortable seats and not always
have to strain out the door-clos-
ing, pencil-dropping, throat-
clearing sounds.

T therefore beg: The Nether-
lands Chamber Choir is coming

records I can say that they are

tastic beauty and spirit, perhaps
the finest choral group in
Europe, and certainly finer than
anything this country can boast
of. To place them in Chambers,
where their stained-glass beauty
would be shattered and ragged,
would be nothing less than an
inexcuseable crime against mus-
ic, an insult to the Choir itself,
and an outrage to the people
who attend the concert. It's time
somebody did something.

Dear Editor,

We were privileged to have
the opportunity to see the film
“Operation Abolition” and to
hear the Lewis-Patterson debate
a few weeks ago.

With respect to the film
“Operation Abolition,” a good
portion of those sincere David-
son students who saw the film
have come away convinced the
film was basically honest and
true. This group was equally
convinced that the so called
“Patterson group” was for a
reason not readily apparent, at-
tempting to discredit the film
and the HUAC.

TRUTH UNTARNISHED

It was stated that this film
has been put together in a way
that although it gives the im-
pression of presenting a con-
tinuous account of events actual-
ly presents incidents out of con-
text and out of continuity to
prove its point. Fulton Lewis
who edited and narrated the
film freely admits that it was
impossible to determine the ex-

ID JUST LIKE TO GET AWAY,
AND 6O OUT AND SEE NEW
THINGS AND MEET NEW PEOPLE

act sequence of some of the
segments of news film.

But any reversal of sequence
or other details upon which the
“Patterson group” attack is
based, have absolutely no effect
on the truth of the film or on
its importance as a document to
which the American people
should be exposed.

The film shows a group of
identified and undenied Com-
munist leaders and a group of
young people who were whipped
up by these Communists to dis-
orderly conduct. The clear con-
nection between the Commun-
ists leaders and the resulting
riots was not refuted.

REASONS QUESTIONED

We saw in the discussion be-
twecn Patterson and Lewis fully
revealed the nature of the case
against the film, a case built on
irrelevant details. And thus, a
caus* of deeper concern to us is
why this attack on the film is
earried on with such vehemence
in view of the weakness of the
case against it.

When a duly constituted com-
mittee of Congress prepares for
presentation to the American
people, a film showing one phase
of the Communist menace, we
wonder with grave concern why
such strenuous and continuing
efforts are made to dismiss it
as a “fake,” which it is not.

The simple fact is that no-
thing has been faked. All of
the scenes are actual news films
of actual events taken on the
spot by cameramen of San Fran-
cisco TV stations. In an effort
to present the story as it hap-
pened, these films were obtain-
ed from the stations which cov-

listed as a definite depressant
by several professors.

“The false standard establish-
ed by grades” was hit by one
professor.

On the positive side, special
privileges for the overachievers,
such as being excused from
exams, were suggested. Unique
was the proposal of requiring
more quality points from the
more able students.

At any rate, as a person put
it, perhaps “getting by is a Dav-
idson tradition.”

ered the event as a news story.
This is the reason why the film
appears disjointed in some se-
quences, and why some of the
film is of poor quality.

If the film had been deliber-
ately made as a “documentary,”
with staging and “dramatic” ren-
dition of the events, then there
might be some question as to its
authenticity. But the opposite is
true.

COMMON ENEMY

None of the foregoing contro-
versy casts any light whatever
on the main idea that the House
Committee is trying to impart
in this film: namely, that a
small group of revolutionaries
can, by their skill, dedication,
and preparation, influence a
large and innocent crowd of
loyal, intelligent Americans to
subvert and defy established
law and justice, to the further-
ance of the Communist aims and
to the detriment of the very in-
stitutions that have made Ameri-
ea great and free.

This is not a time for disunity
and dissension. This is a time of
crisis when all responsible, loyal
groups in the United States, in-
cluding the Davidson faculty.
newspaper, Chaplain’s office and
students should be working to-
gether for the destruction of
the insidious, immoral and un-
godly conspiracy of Communism.

Communism is, by its own
declaration, the implacable ene-
my of all of us. We know that
you are aware of this awful
truth. Let us all join in a dedi-
cated, militant effort to destroy
the evil which threaffens to
destroy us.
