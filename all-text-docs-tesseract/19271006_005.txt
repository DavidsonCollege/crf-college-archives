JOACHIM LECTURE ON INDIA
PRAISED BY TESTIMONIALS

Mr. H. H. Joachim, noted author, traveler,
and authority on India, who is to speak at
Shearer Hall next Wednesday night, is held |
in very high esteem by those who have heard
him, as is shown by the following testimon-
ials from various sources :

National Secretary of the Gideons:

“IT heard Mr. Joachim lecture on compara-
tive religions at the Men’s League Convention
in Columbus, Ohio, and was much impressed |
by his thrilling address, which surpassed any- |
thing I have heard for years. His English
was faultless.”

J. Knox Montgomery, President, Muskin-
gum College, New Concord, Ohio:

“No speaker has so challenged the atten-
tion of our student body or so thoroughly
gripped them with the mastery of his pre-
sentation as did Mr. Joachim when he lec- |
tured on comparative religions. It was one)
of the keenest discussions, as far as_ its
analysis is concerned, that it has been my
privilege to hear.”

David Beecroft, President, Scarsdales, N. |
Y., Congregational Church Men’s Club:

“Mr. Joachim’s lecture on Gandhi was one
of the clearest and most logical presentations '
of what the reformer stands for that I have
ever listened to.”

Secretary, Women’s Club, Princeton, N. J.:

“Mr. Joachim speaks with’ the compelling
eloquence of one who loves his subject and
must make others love it. His style is vig-
orously intense, vivid, and -his splendidly
rounded sentences bear a message that holds
the interest of every hearer.”

Ralph D. Wellons, Dean of Tusculum Col-
lege, Greenville, Tennessee:

or

“I was for seven years connected with a
college in Lucknow, India, and can say with-
out reservation that Mr. Joachim has given
one-of the most balanced and national discus-
sions of India’s problems that I have heard
since leaving that country three years ago. It
seems to me that such a lecturer should do
much to bring our American people to a real
appreciation of their relationships to the peo-
ples of other countries,” 4

Sarah McMillan Rogers, Coker College,
Hartsville, S. C.:

“He impressed his audience by. his superb
use of language, by his clear, rational and
unbiased point of view and his fine sincerity..
We were equally. charmed by his personality

Army Officer Returns to Davidson
After, Prolonged Absence Due to

Operation

Lieut. R. C. Beckett has again returned |
to Davidson as an officer of the David-
son College R. O. T. C. unit, after an ab-
sence of several months which was pro-
longed on account of an operation that
he had to undergo last July.

Lieutenant Beckett was operated on at
the Walter Reed Federal Hospital at
Washington, D. C,, last July, his opera-
tion being one that required some time
for recuperation. The remainder of the
time not spent in the hospital was spent
in and around Washington.

This year the tactical officers will re-
main the same with the exception of
company “D,” Lieutenant Otto will be in
charge of that company in the absence of
Captain Weems... The other officers in
charge of other companies are: Company

Cullum Speaks to
Members of Band

Professor E, J. Cullum, Davidson's new
music instructor, was the chief speaker
of the day at the weekly Sunday meet-
ing of the Ministerial Band. Aside from
his speech the instructor also played and
sang a song.

Church*hymns was the subject on which
the professor spoke. He brought up a
phase of the subject, about which most
ministers rarely hear, that of which
hymns should be sung, and how to sing
them. During his very interesting: talk,
in which he traced the development of
the hymn down to the présent day, he
mentioned that there are only sixteen
hymns that can be found in all the stand-
ard Protestat hymn books.

Prof. Cullum announced that every
Thursday night at 7:30 o'clock, the Y.
M. C. A. quartet practice would be held.
Anyone is eligible to try out for it. Also
at 8:30 o'clock on the same night .every
week he said that he would conduct a
class especially for ministerial students
on how to choose hymns and how. to léad
Irynin singing, He said, however, that
the class was open and

to anyone no

; grades would be given! No new business

was discussed,

Prayer Emphasized 7
by Volunteer Band

The topic for the last meeting of the
R. F. Sloop
was the principle speaker of the meeting.

Volunteer Band was Prayer.

He spoke on the general topic of prayer,
with special emphasis on its application to
the mission field, and its vital importance
in the life of the individual. To quote
the speaker, “Prayer is one of the mys-
teries of life, and the biggest mystery of
all is that- people don’t pray more.” Aft-
er the talk the meeting was thrown into
an open, discussion of prayer and the
value of having prayer groups on the

campus. It was urged that each mem-
ber be responsible for the organization
of prayer groups on each hall. This has
been very successful the past and
much good has been done ‘by them among
the students.

in

The purpose of the Volunteer Band is
to further the cause of missions, and that
it-has~-been=done-welt-in-the-past is” evi=
denced by the long list of missionaries
on the foreign and home fields. A few of
these men are Dr. Price, of China, whose
'son Harry, was a most popular, man on
‘the Davidson campus, Mr. McIlwaine,
and Mr. Hudson, In a recent meeting
‘the Volunteer Band was addressed by
some of the leaders of the “Y,” Jim Ap-
Hugh Arrowood.and others.

pleby,

Theyband hopes to make its influence
as wide-spread as it is helpful by the
books on missions, which may be ob-
| tained at the “Y,” and its ether-dotivities.
