Dartmouth's Big Green rolls all over Wildcats 38-7

By MATT TERRELL
and STEWART RAWSON

The woes of Davidson football
continued this week, with the:
obliging assistance of the Big
Green of Dartmouth. The Wildcats
dropped their fifth game this sea-
son, 38-7. Davidson played the
game in a way which is becoming
commonplace for the squad.

Davidson fell behind early in the
game and once again played the
second half out of pride, albeit a
much wounded pride. The Wild-
cats’ misfortunes came in the form
of a porous defense and turnovers
uncharacteristic of Davidson foot-
ball.

Dartmouth started out the game
with a quick field goal and a 45-
yard strike to Craig Morton from
quarterback Chris Rorke. The
second quarter brought no relief for
the Cats. Terry Phillips of Dart-
mouth racked up a pair of sixes for
the Big Green with touchdown
scampers of eight yards and one
yard. “Before the two teams headed
to the locker room, though, Dart-
mouth found the end zone again,
this time on a one-yard run after a

~ The cross-country teams trav-
eled to Boone, North Carolina, this
past weekend for the Appalachian
State University Classic. Coach
Andrew knew the meet would be
tough in both races and hoped that
such excellent competition will
help to strengthen and develop his '
squad. The weather was not as
ideal as expected with the tempera-
ture being forty degrees and a wind
chill factor of twenty degrees.
However, the races were still fast
and exciting.

Rugby: Gentleman's Game?

By BILL SMITH »

Who are those men who throw
their unshielded bodies into
crowds of similar animals? Well,
we are rugby players. We are a
special breed blessed with the

fierce desire to run over people as .

well as the superior intellect to
understand this intense game. Fif-.
teen of us play in games that last
- eighty minutes with forty-minute
halves. There are no time-outs
\unlike most sports and only two
substitutions can be made during
the entire game. Guess what that
“means, Yes, we are well-condi-
tioned athletes, or else we disgorge
violently and pass out often.
Rugby is not a sport for the
weakhearted.

ately numbered from one through
eight, lodge their heads, arms, but-

tocks, and whatever other body.

form a “scrum.” Within this scrum

the ball, an enlarged egg-like ob-

‘The first half proved disastrous
not only because of the Dartmouth
scores, but also becausé of three
interceptions thrown by Peter
Hughes and the first quarter depar-
ture of freshman Bryn Robinson
due to a thigh injury. With
Robinson’s injury the bulk of the
Davidson offense was sidelined.
Mike Skoczynski commanded the
Davidson offensive unit during
most of the second half and con-
nected on seven of twelve passes

for 85 yards. The highlight of the —

game for Davidson, excepting the
fourth quarter touchdown pass
from Skoczynski to Robert Sickles
from 29 yards out, was an 85-yard
return by Brian Overcash brought
back ona clipping penalty.

The Dartmouth victory marked
the first win of the season for the
Big Green (1-2). Having lost his
opening games by a combined
score of 75-6, the victory gave
first-year coach Buddy Teevens
his initial win and the first for the
school outside the Ivy League

since 1977. Davidson carries its

season into a Homecoming week-
end clash with Wingate at
Richardson Field Saturday.

The men performed well with
each of the top five runners getting
his best time of the season. Appa-
lachian State conquered their home
course, an eight-kilometer course
extending over open and wooded
trails with mostly level or downhill
terrain, due in part to overall win-
ner Dean Duncan. Duncan fin-
ished with a time of twenty-five
minutes, forty-one seconds. Vir-
ginia Tech followed ASU’s thirty
points with forty-one while our
team finished in the latter half of
teams with 154 points. Jay Clug-

another man (the number nine
man) picks the ball up, curls around
the pack, and hurls it toward, yes,
the ten man. This man then runs
straight up field into a gang of
opposing players and proceeds to
be ambushed.

however, he tosses the ball to a
teammate several yards deep who
in turn repeats the process. This
continues until the ball is either out
of bounds, touched down for a

score of four points, or obtained by -
the defensive team. Theseplayers-

who run with the ball are generally
the backs with numbers ten
through fifteen.

said, and in some cases corrected,
