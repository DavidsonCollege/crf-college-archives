artmill reexamines pay-as-you-go policy

By KEVIN SHELLY
Staff Writer

The Physical Education De-
partment has not yet an
nounced a definite policy con-
cerning the use of clothing and
equipment.

The P.E. Department’s ori-
ginally announced policy of
pay-as-you-go has met with
strong student opposition.
The equipment will remain
locked and unavailable to stu-
dents until a final decision is
made.

The new policy is being re-
examined by Athletic Director
Thomas Cartmill. A meeting
was held Tuesday by Cartmill
with members of his staff to
discuss problems with the new
policy and possible solutions.

A meeting of the same
nature occurred Wednesday
between Cartmill and a com-
mittee from the Student Gov-

ernment Association. The
Davidsonian was barred from
attendance at that meeting. -

Cartmill has said he intends
to release full details of any
changes in the new policy by
early next week. According to
students at that meeting some
revision seems likely but pre-
cisely what they will be re-
mains unclear.

Physical Education Director
Raymond Stone commented
‘last week that the new policy
questions the integrity of the
honor code.

Will Terry, Dean of Stu-
dents, responded, ‘‘I don’t
think’ it is a reflection on the
honor,system, rather on the
organization of the gym.”’

Assistant Director of Ath-
letics Tom Couch, asked about
Terry’s comment, said, ‘‘Will
is a minister. I don’t know
what kind of background he

has to judge. I wouldn’t say
he’s wrong, but it isn’t proce-
dure, it is a lack of personnel.’’
There is general agreement
within the department that
better supervision of the buil-
ding is needed. Members of
the department refused to
directly comment on the qual-
ity and dependability of the
work-study students formerly
assigned to issue equipment
and patrol the gym, stressing
rather the need for full-time
supervision, particularly be-
tween 4 pm and midnight.
Cartmill stated that the
budget does not allow for that
sort of expansion this year,
but it is possible next year.
Cartmill would like a super-
visor for each area of the gym
and he suggested a club
system with ID cards as a
means of controlling users
outside the immediate college

‘community.

Couch feels that selling,
rather than loaning equipment
will definitely cut down on
losses because the attitude will
be, ‘If it is mine, I'll take care
of it.’’ However, Will Terry
disagreed with the sale’s pol-
icy, commenting, ‘‘It seems to
me to be grossly unfair for
what a student pays at Dav-
idson that he is not provided a
reasonable amount of equip-
ment for Intramurals, phys-
ical education and recreation.’’
Cartmill responded to Terry’s
statement by noting that it is
not the format of most colleges
to supply equipment in the
free play area and that Intra-
mural and physical education
equipment will still be covered
at no extra cost.

Cartmill emphasized that
equipment will be sold at cost
and that it is not his intention

interdisciplinary studies

By LYMAN COLLINS
Asst. News Editor

Dean of the Honors Center
Robert L. Avinger Jr. has
initiated a major change in
focus toward interdisciplinary
studies. ;

“This year we’re trying to
stimulate‘an academic interest
in two major interdisciplinary
projects,’’ explained Avinger.
“They are an American Stud-
ies program anda Public
Policy program.

“In our programs we want
to mesh and to intertwine
various areas around a com-
mon theme. An example of
this would be American Cul-
ture in the twenties and thir-
ties as a part of our American
Studies program,’’ he con-
tinued.

Avinger just recently as-
sumed his’ duties as dean,
taking over in July from Dr.
Earl R. MacCormac, now
chairman of the philosophy
department.

Avinger explained that the
purpose of the Center is to
perform certain academic
functions and to facilitate
certain student programs.

“While emphasizing our in-
terdisciplinary work we want

to keep in mind that students—

do apply to the Center to do
advanced research and inde-
pendent study and we do wish
to accommodate them,’’ he
said.

Avinger pointed out that
the three-year study of the
Rocky River, which had in-
volved the entire Honors Cen-
ter, was how complete. Exten-
sive projects along the lines of
that. project are still in the
planning stages and depend on
a number of factors including

funding.

“I think another project of
that nature would be struc-
tured differently,’’ said Avin-
ger. ““There were some prob-
lems with the Rocky River
project because every student
in the Center was required to
participate:

“‘We got different feed-
backs, of course. For some
students it was a tremendous
learning experience, but for
others, well, it was almost a
waste of time.

“That project illustrated the
fact that we need to try to fit
studerits to their natural ele-
ment,’’ he said. ,

“If you review the applica-

tions to the Center, the stron-
gest emphasis is probably on
the interdisciplinary work,’’ he
added.

Avinger pointed to the Re-
discovering American Movies
series, which the Honors Cen-
ter is sponsoring along with
the English Department and
the Union Film Committee, as
an example of the kind of
outgrowth possible from the
American Studies program.

“We're not trying to com-
pete with the Union in plan-
ning activities for the student
body,’’ he said. ‘‘We’re pro-
gramming things for students

THEFTS in the gym have been

to make money from the sales.
Coach Martin said, ‘Frankly I
think very few students will
buy the equipment,”’ and he
agreed that some of the quoted
prices may be high but that
most are in line with costs.

Jeff Brown, Intramurals
President, responded to the
question of whether or not he
would buy a uniform by
saying, ‘‘Buy clothes? No, not
at those prices.”’

Responses to the question of

‘whether or not the new policy

would affect gym use were
varied in their optimism. Cart-
mill felt that it would not
influence gym use but added,
“if it becomes a problem I
want to talk to a student
group about it. There is no-
thing golden about this thing,
I’m open to input.”’

Stone’s response was more
guarded, ‘‘It is too early to tell
but my prediction is less use,
even though I hope not.’”’
Brown did not think it would
affect major sports but felt
that handball, squash, and
other sports that cater more to
casual participation would be
affected.

Overcrowding moves Counselling

from Chambers to Union basement

By AMANDA HALL
Sports Editor

The basement of Grey Un-
ion now houses the offices of
Dr. William Hight, Director of
the Student Counseling Cen-
ter, Davidson’s two clinical
psychologists, Dr. Amelia
Dockery and Dr. Meredith
Hall, and Ken Wood, the
Director of Experimental Pro-
grams and Life/Work Plan-
ning.

Hight and Wood were loc-
ated in Chambers Building,
while the psychologists were
in Phi Hall last year. In order
to give the counselors more
room and to keep the three
programs in one location plans
were made to move Dockery
and Hall into Chambers base-
ment.

‘“They tried to put it in
Chambers basement, but there

was just not enough room,”’
said Union Director C. Shaw
Smith.

‘*‘When it got to a point
when all the professors would
not have private offices there
was no question that counsel-
ing would go here,’ he said.

Smith originally planned to

use the area to experiment
with new programs for the
Union like an expanded Arts
and Crafts program, or an
informal lounge with a TV and
"a fireplace.
“We are sorry we couldn’t
experiment with the area like
we wanted, but we’re very

happy to have counseling
here,’’ Smith said. ‘‘A liberal
arts college as much as any
institution I know needs to
give the students any oppor-
tunity possible to let them find
out what they want—not nec-
essarily just jobs. We are not a
training school.’’

“The other angle is, and this
is part of the Union’s ideal,
there is so much demand for
academic excellence that there
is little chance for learning
how to live. The Union is
trying to give that chance, and
the counseling is also,’’ he
said.

The Union Board included
in the proposal for a new
Union building five years ago
the request that all counseling
facilities be located in one
