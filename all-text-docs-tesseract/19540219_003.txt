FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1954

During the course
of the coming week
each of Davidson’s
winter sports teams
will draw another sea-
son to a close with only
post season tourna-
ments remaining on
their respective dock-
ets. The basketballers
will be the last of the
cold-weather groups to
close up shop for this
year when they travel
up to West Virginia
University for the
Southern Conference
basketball tournament

By JOHN HANDLEY
on March 4-5-6. The wrestling and swimming squads will wind
up their 1954 activities next weekend with their Conference
tournies.

With these sports about to complete their schedules for
this season and the weather turning warm, the season for
the spring sports to come into predominance is at hand. Al-
ready the football team has half completed its spring training
period and Track Coach Whittle’s voice can be heard in the
afternoons across the Richardson Field turf urging on his
charges. Monday afternoon the baselvall team swings into its
first practice session and tennis will soon get underway.

Prospects are good for another good track season under
the magic tough of “Pete” Whittle who hasn’t had a losing
team for the Red and Black in thirteen years. “Pete’’ has sev-
eral good men back from last year with a few newcomers
stepping in to fill the shoes of last year’s graduates and should
come up with another of his fine teams.

Coach Dick McKee may be coaching a Southern Confer-
ence champion tennis team as May and the end of the season
rolls around as this is the year that the Cats have looked for-
ward to with Carolina and Duke in another conference and
the men who have been playing the top positions during their
first two years at Davidson really coming into their own this
season.

The baseball team is the big question mark on the spring
slate. Last year’s Cat baseballers failed to break into the win
column, but with most of the first team back for another
year’s action, coupled with a few good breaks and the Cats
may come through with a good team.

As the cage season draws to a close the Southern Con-

- ference standing seems to be pointing toward either Furman

or Richmond being the Cats’ first-round opponents when

they travel up to Morgantown. The outcome of the Furman-

Richmond game at Richmond will be the deciding factor.
Furman beat Richmond in Greenville earlier in the season.

Cats meet State Here onda

Tankmen Meet
Wofford Here

Davidson’s Varisty swimmers tangle with Wofford here
tomorrow in a meet which will wind up the current season.
The team is making final preparations for the trip to Blacks-
burg, Virginia, next week for the Southern Conference swim-
ming meet. The meet is to be held on February 25-27.

The Cat swimmers split ne .
cisions in a r of mee
weekend. on Friday, Davidson Wildcat Gridders
edged The Citadel swimmers,
44-40, getting revenge for a loss

the Bulldogs handed them earlier
this season.
Ormond Sets

Al Ormond set two new pool
records in winning the 150-yd. in-
dividual medley and the 200-yd.
backstroke events. Then he teamed
with Montgomery and Patton to
set a new mark in the 300-yd. med-
ley relay. The 400-yd, freestyle re-
lay, the final event, was the de-
ciding one, and.the Cats had what
it took in the clutch.

On Saturday, the swimmers
played host to the swimming team
of Emory University. The Emory
splashers led most of the way as
they took a 46-38 decision. Glancy
led the individual scoring as he

won three first-place honors for[

Emory..
The Davidson freshman swim
team, now sporting a 3 wins-1 loss

record, finish the season at High
Point on Wednesday. The team will
send six representatives to the
Southern Conference meet to com-
pete in the freshman division.

Former frosh cage coach Tom
Fetzer has joined golf’s honored
few after shooting a 123-yard hole
in one on the Mooresville Mills
golf course on January 10. Fetzer
who also serves as backfield coach
during the football season per-
formed the golf oddity on Moores-
ville's fifth hole with a nine iron.

Will Close Practice
Sessions With Game

After a very impressive scrim-
mage last Saturday afternoon the
Wildcat gridders will not scrim-
mage tomorrow because of the
dance weekend break, but go
through their paces again next
weekend. With seven days remain-
ing to Coach Dole and his Red

and Black charges for the spring |:

practice sessions under the NCAA
ruling, they will continue their
afternoon workouts into the first
week of March with the big D
Club sponsored Red and Black in-
tra-squad game slated for March 6.

Good Blocking
The team showed good blocking,
especially downfield blocking on
punt returns as the Blacks edged
the Reds 5 to 4. The surprise of
the day was frosh halfback Don
Comer who tallied three times
during the afternoon. Comer ran
for two and gathered in a Dyke
Little pass for the third.

The freshmen from last fall’s
sensational team showed up well
and Coach Dole expressed his ap-
proval of the showings made by
the team thus far’ and expects to
get a lot done toward a much im-
proved Wildcat record on the grid-
iron next fall.

the top slot in the league, but
the Kappa Sigs have overcome stiff
opposition in the last two weeks
to take over the second spot and
put themselves in contention for
the crown.

Barring upsets, these two clubs
should continue to set the pace in
the league. The Betas are still un-
defeated and could possibly finish
that way if they can get by a tough
Pika team. The Kappa Sigs have
lost only once—to the Betas. The
Kappa Sigs, led by Corky Clark
and Johriny Smith, defeated the
Pikas and the ATOs to take over
sole possession of the second spot
from the other two clubs.

Phi Gams 41; Pi Kepps 28

Champion, took a 41-28 win over
the Pi Kapps in the opening round
of the week. Swain led tife losers
with 12 markers.

Pikas 41; SPE 27

John Handley and Lindley
Beardsley tallied 11 points each to
lead the Pikas to a 41-27 victory
over the SPEs. Brown got 10 points

Powerful State ’Pack

PAGE THREE

y Night

Ranked Heavy Favorites

By BUDDY LYLES

The North Carolina State Wolfpack will invade the John-
son gymnasium next Monday to engage the upset-minded Wild-
cats. Coach Everett Case will bring his usual array of talent,
and will definitely be the favorites by at least twenty points.
Such familiar old faces as Mel Thompson and Dick Tyler, and
the sophomore sensation, Vic Modelet will be trying to make
the return engagement a runaway. Then there's the tre-
mendous bench strength that will be all in State’s favor in

case the Wolfpack tries the infamous press.

Captain Graeme Keith still re-
covering from a bad cold which
slowed him down considerably
against The Citadel, will carry the
Cats’ big hopes along with reliable
Hobby Cobb. Ray Harding has
been showing improvement’ Jately
and has added considerably in the
scoring punch. Harding replaced
sh Bennett when Bennett was in-
jured and should probably see
plenty of action on Monday night.
George Melton, who did a good job
of guarding Carolina's center Paul
Likins and matched him point for
point, could help a great deal in
the rebound department.

The Wildcats missed a_ big
chance to secure a hold’ on either
sixth or possibly fifth place when

day night has hurt the Cats

they dropped a 75 to 70 contest
to the Citadel last Saturday. De-
spite playing without the services
of Ish Bennett who injured his
ankle the night before, and with
Captain Keith suffering from a
bad cold, the Cats, led by Hobby
Cobb and Ray Harding almost
pulled the game from the fire. Ish
Bennett injured his ankle in the
Cats’ win over the College of

ad

Charleston and saw little action in
that game, but should be back in
form by the State game.

Keith had one of his better
nights against the Tar Heels, hit-
ting for 19 points while Harding
had 14, and Cobb 11. These three
boys with the return of Ish Ben-
nett to top form could be able
to give the Wolfpack a tough time
as the Wildcats are traditionally
noted for upsets on their home
court. Bennett who has failed to
hit in the last three games due
to being slowed by his injury, can
give the. Cats an added scoring
punch.

Davidson now sports a three won
and four lost conference record.
Conceding a probable loss to Fur-
man, which will give the Cats a
3:-5 record, it will leave them in
at least seventh place when the

tournament opens.

FRESHMAN CAGERS

END ‘54 SEASON
IN STATE PRELIM

By BUGIE KING

The steadily improving freshmen
face Pfeiffer’s basketballers to-
night in what promises to be a
real battle on the Misenheimer
court. Although the Davidson Kit-
tens won the first game 78-57, the
Pfeiffer club has recently been
showing a real scoring punch. They
beat Charlotte College 104-74 just
before the Kittens handed the
Owls a 74-40 licking. It may be a
case of offense versus defense, as
the low scores of many of the
Davidson games this year indi-
cate.

Walker Leads

Freshman scoring this year has
been led by Gaylord Walker and
David Shaw, who had 19 and 15
respectively against Charlotte in
their last outing. Shaw and Walker
will be the sparkpiugs tonight, but
the rest of the team has been
scoring consistently too. This
teamwork has been the keynote
