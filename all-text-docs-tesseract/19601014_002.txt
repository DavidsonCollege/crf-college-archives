Vote Shows Need For Exams

For the past three weeks THE
DAVIDSONIAN has investigated the
possible adoption of comprehensive
examinations at Davidson.

We have presented statements by
officials from outstanding colleges
and universities where comprehen-
Sives have become an essential part
of the academic program.

The success which other schools
have had with comprehensives is en-
ough in itself to merit Davidson's
serious consideration.

Dr. Frontis W. Johnston, dean of
faculty, has said, “Comprehensive ex-
aminations can be good for Davidson
College if properly administered.”

‘We see no reason why Davidson
cannot properly administer these ex-
aminations.

THE DAVIDSONIAN received a
vote of confidence concerning the ad-
ministering of comprehensives from
* a majority of the college departmen-
tal heads last week. This enthusiasm
on the part of the faculty will help to
insure the proper administering of
comprehensives if the examinations
are adopted at Davidson.

We feel that the results of the stu-
dent body poll.on comprehensive ex-
aminations (see page one) are evidence

that Davidson needs to adopt the pro-
gram. By almost a 2-to-1 majority the
student body voted against the adop-
tion of the comprehensives.

The results of the poll indicate that
students under our present academic
program feel unprepared, or are too

lazy to prepare (‘I don’t want to get
shot out of the saddle my senior

year”) to be tested on their two years
work in their major subject.

When students are unable to recall
and relate the majority of their acad-
emic work in their major subject
there is a definite weakness in the
academic system.

Certainly one goal of an academic
institution is for students to depart
upon graduation with ‘a satisfactory
understanding of their courses of
study. But it is evident that a student
does not have a satisfactory under-
standing of his course of study if he
cannot recall or relate the majority
of the material in his major subject.

If comprehensives are adopted they
can help relieve the academic defici-
ency of Davidson College and raise
academic standards by requiring
more of her students. Then graduates
will leave Davidson with a more com-
plete education.

It's Working After All

After viewing the new chapel at-
titude with a somewhat jaundiced eye
for the past three weeks, we're ready
to back down—it is working after all.

Student cooperation with the fac-
ulty’s “get tough” policy on chapel
conduct has been the key factor in
better chapels this fall. The David-
son gentleman is a redoubtable mes-
ter when it comes to the subtle dis-
ruption of an auditorium—assembly.
He could have made it extremely dif-
ficult for the faculty to get tough
with any effectiveness.

We alse commend the planning
committees for producing mere in-
teresting chapels. Henry Shue and
the Student Council have done an
outstanding job so far. Dr. Martin is
scheduled to take on the student bedy
in another question-answer session
during the Monday assembly. We feel
that this type of program is one of
the most valuable innovations in the
chapel format in recent years. Per-

haps it could be extended to include
question periods with other members
of the faculty and administration, and
with leaders of student organizations.
We would make one suggestion for
the more effective use this type of
program: the “man on the spot”
should make his answers shorter,
more concise and to-the-point, so
that more questions can be asked.

The Thursday chapel for religious
programs has the only weak
point in the ceca of assem-
blies. With the exteption of Sewan-
nee -President McCrady’s talk last
week, none of these programs has
been particularly inspiring. Students
rather sarcastically refer to it as
“Holy Day.”

Student Body President Henry Shue
has asked for ideas for the student
assembly programs. If we want to con-
tinue to make chapel a rewarding ex-
perience instead of an ordeal, we
should do all we can to help him out.

The Organization Man

Last Wednesday afternoon Dave
Clark and Malcolm Seawell, two of
North Carolina’s top political figures.
showed up in the Union for a coffee-
discussion and a little politicking
among the college set. The trouble
was, the college set failed to show..

Ed Johnston, the Union's Organiza-
tion Man in charge of getting top
newsmakers to the campus and mak-
ing them glad they came, was stuck
with congressional candidate. the
ex-Attorney General, and seven stu-
dents who had wandered in from the
snack bar.

Johnston, whirring into action, sug-
gested that the pair go on a tour of
the campus and meet the administra-
tion. In the meantime, he hustled off
to the dormitories and began to round
up the few students who weren't on
the flickerbail fields or in the library.

Back at the Union 20 minutes later,
Johnston had corralled a dozen puz-
zled students, several faculty mem-
bers, and a few townspeeple. Dave
Clark made his pitch and left, a little
disappointed at the turnout, but

promising to help secure another big
name for Johnston’s pre-election ef-
forts to crack Davidson’s strange

apathy where political matters are in- |

volved.

Johnston deserves a big vote of ap-
preciation for his accomplishments as
chairman of the Union's Roundtable
Committee. He failed to get Nixon to
the campus, scored a very near miss
‘with Adlai Stevenson, but managed to
lure Mrs. Joe P. Kennedy and Robert
Gavin for. brief speaking stints. He
still has high hopes of securing Sam
Rayburn, Jimmy Byrnes and Richard
Russell before the election, and
Charles Raper Jonas afterwards.

It wasn’t Johnston’s fault that the
Clark-Seawell discussion was a flop—
it was dropped into his lap the day
before and no one would cooperate
with publicity.

But Ed Johnston isn’t a man easily
discouraged, and if he has anything
to say about it, Rayburn and Byrnes
and Russell will all be here, even if
they do have to speak to a captive
audience.

We admire his persistence.

By BILL ARMSTRONG
Davidsonien Feature Writer

About Tuesday of every week,
I find myself faced with the
perplexing problem of the ap-
proaching week-end. 1 discov-
ered early in my college life
that Davidson College is no
place to spend a week-end. To
remain on campus is pure folly
and, I might add, quite danger-
ous.

During my freshman year,
one boy went completely ber-
serk after spending two week-
ends on campus. He began
talking to himself and later
was discovered hitting his head
against trees, just. to hear the
sound. Too much quietness af-
fects people in strange ways.

TYPICALLY ‘BLIND’
But I am getting off the sub-
ject. I was telling you about
my week-ends. Fate has, for
some unknown reason, taken
me in hand and bestowed upon
me the dubious honor of being
looked upon as a typical blind
date. For some unknown. rea-
son, people are drawn to me
when they have the need of a
sucker for a blind date.

Because of this, I have be-
come in the past few ‘years,
somewhat wary of the glowing.
or not so glowing, phrases used
to describe these hidden and
unknown beauties.

There are two phrases that -

&

ONLY IN DAVIDSON

will strike terror in the stout-
est of blind-date hearts: “She
has a wenderful personality,”
and “All the girls like her.”
What terrible things to say
about any girl.

PERSONALITY?

First of all, have you ever
seen a good looking girl who
had a wonderful personality?
Let's face it, the good looking
girls don’t have to have won-
derful personalities. With
everything else, who's going to
notice a little thing like per-
sonality? What good will it do
if she can carry on a brilliant
conversation when you can't
even stand to look at her?

Now let us turn to, “All the
girls like her.” If you have a
girl who once gave you the
shaft, then this is the best way
in the world to get back at her.
Once it gets around that all
the girls like a girl, then she is
branded for lite. This girl is
lost. she doesn't stand a chance.
She doesn’t even have a won-
derful personality. And to top
it all off. she offers no compe-
tition to the other girls, this

‘is why they can afford to like

her.
, NO ROOMMATES
Also beware of roommates.
It is very seldom that two at-

tractive people room together
in college. After all, look at

Wary, Worried Don Juan
Wrestles With Weekend

your roommate—see what 1

you to date his girl’s room-
mate, beware!

Girls are very cagey in de-
scribing their roommates. The
most popular phrase is, “I just
love my roommate, she’s really

crazy!” This can mean any-|

thing. The girl may be an ex-
pert in judo, or she may smoke
cigars; you never can tell, but
nevertheless, beware! '

This brings us up to the real-
ly glowing phrases. Occasionally
a boy will describe a. prospec-
tive date as, “The best looking
girl I've ever seen.’ I am al-
ways a bit suspicious of this
type. If this girl is so beautiful,
why isn't he dating her? Why
ask me?

TOO LATE

‘I never get the answer until
it is too late. Somewhere in be-
tween the time that he last
saw this girl and the time that
I date her, some kind of meta-
morphosis takes place. He later
explains that she seems to have
“put on a little weight.” This
means the girl looks like she
is going into hibernation.

So beware of the “friend”
who would help you out dur.
ing the week-end. Your best
bet is a girl with no personality
and one whom tke girls al] hate.
But until you find her, welcome
to the ranks.

Editor's

Editor’s Note: Dr. Ernest Petterson is professor of Economics
at Davidson. Below he discusses the 1960 Presidential election.

There is considerable evidence that the “undecided”
vote in the current Presidential election is presently
large. This is not surprising for the independent voter is
presented with few real differences.

The two Presidential candidates are almost identical
in age, experience, intelligence, etc. Both possess in al-
most equal amounts the limitations and virtues of con-
temporary middle-class Americans. Both are religious,
but not so deeply that it has any real influence on their
behavior. Both would rather be President than right.

The vice-presidential candidates are nonentities, al-
most complete ciphers. One cannot make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear, and the boys on Madison Avenue, who
often convince the American public that a sow's ear is
really a silk purse, are not even trying to do anything
ith the vice-president material which the political par-

When one turns to the issues, the situation is the
same. In the area of foreign policy Kennedy correctly
says that our foreign policy is bankrupt, a complete
failure, tut all he offers is to do better that which has
been done in the past, and it is difficult to be enthus-
iastic about bigger and better failures.

This is the most important issue of the campaign.
The American people need to be told, among other
things, that we must negotiate on disarmament. not mere
reduction of armaments, with the Russians as equals,
even though this will be difficult and trying; that we
must meet the “revolution of expectations” that is occur-
ring in Africa, Asia, and Latin America with assistance
and policies that are not based on anti-communism and
maintaining United States private investments intact;
that we must cease refusing to recognize the de facto

government of China and
rightful place in the counc

reventing it from taking its

of the world. This requires

a wise and courageous leadership for which neither can-
mean? So when a friend asks|didate has the ability or inclination.

On the domestic scene there is again almost no dif-

ference. No matter which

candidate is elected, the

legal and institutional framework in which labor-man-
agement relations operate will be little changed; the
farm program will continue inadequate from both the
farmers’ and the consumers’ standpoint; the aged will
get some medical benefits, again fer short of adequate;
taxes and government expenditures will remain high,

and likely increase.
It is only in connection

am

with using fiscal

licy to
solve the problems of unemployment, recesstot . "and
economic growth that there is any noticeable difference,
and even here the distinction is nebulous and uncertain..
Both parties will use fiscal policy to prevent a “reces-
sion” from becoming a “depression.”

_ _But the record and philosophy of the Republicans
indicate that they will use it grudgingly and petulantly,
and only as a last resort, while the reeord and philosophy
of the Democrats show that they are likely to take the
necessary action with enthusiasm and amiability, and be-
fore being forced to do so by the course of events.

With our economic system so interdependent and
delicately balanced, this slight difference—the uncer-

tainty lies in the presence

of conservative Seuthern

Democrats in Congress, who, in 1960, voted with the
Republicans on over one-half of the importent issues
—might spell the difference between prosperity and

depression.

So on the basis of this tenuous distinction, .1 am in-
clined to vote for Mr. Kennedy, but the inclination is so
weak. and the dissatisfaction and disgust so strong, I may
be led to write in Norman Thomas’ name.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Wallenburg Knocks Spiritual Sterility;

Fraternity Men Clarify Pledge Proposal

Dear Editor:

Quite possibly the strangest
situation ever to arise in the
affairs of this college during
the past few years was the mis-
behavior in Chapel and Vespers
which reached a peak last year
and which has since subsided.

it was strange because, to
my knowledge, there never
appeared the usual masses of
protesting letters-to-the-edi-
ter, never did the standard
panel discussion group arise.
Instead, there were only mu-
ted discussions among the .
students and determined
Statements from the trustees
and administration. Why was
it that a controversy so wide-
spreed, judging from the dis-
turbances in chepel, found
80 little pubWc expression?

First, it was not because of
expected retaliation from the
college. Indeed, the. college
once asked for an expression
of opinion contrary to its own
views, but could find no one
willing to make such expres-
sion. This was because there
was no one willing to admit
that the only reason for the
misbehavior was that it was

a fad, just as black umbrellas

are.

Indeed, the reasons for the
misconduct were never dis
cussed, and it was assumed that
the fault lay in the programs
presented. Now that the prob-
lem has been solved by placat-

ing the student body with a

few extra cuts, perhaps the
true question can be discussed
more intelligently. Does this
college nave the right to force
students to attend Chape) and
Vespers, even if this conflicts
with the students’ moral ideals?

This is nothing more or less
than the question of religious
toleration which has always
been @ problem, in all ages.
Does a society, any society,
have the right to dictate to

its citizens their moral vat-

ves?

Can a Hitler suddenly decree
that murder and rape and pil-
lage are the measures by which
a man can be judged? The tra-
ditional view in the United
States is that he eannot. Other
possible viewpoints are beyond
the scope of this letter.

Thus, the only complicating
factor in this case is that a
student enters this college of
his own free will, and that he
thereby supposedly gives up all
right to protest against Chapel
and Vespers. Indeed, the whole
argument for required services
rests on this point.

When a student goes to col-
lege, his aim is supposedly
to receive an education and
to develop his powers of ree
soning. Thus it is that some

students form an honest ob-
jection to Christianity after
arriving at coflege and being
exposed to new ideas. Is it
tight for this college to de-
mand that its students not re
spond to eny of the ideas pre-
sented them?

At present the only course
open to a person who comes to
disagree with Christianity is
to leave Davidson. If this is to
be the policy of Davidson Col-
lege, then it is my opinion
that every entering freshman
should be informed of it, if
only for honesty’s sake.

If Davidson is to be a school
of mental eunuchs and relig-
lous hypecrites, as it is today,
then of course the present state
may be allowed to stand.

John G. Wallenburg

Dear Editor:

We would like to clarify a
statement you made in your
editorial “Put Up or Shut Up”
in the October 7, 1960 DAVID-
SONTAN.

The original pledge pre-
gram proposal was originated
and presented to the IFC by
the three of us, whose names
ere signed below, and not by
the Sigma Nu Fraternity.
This propose! was net pre-
sented to Sigma Nu before
the time thet It was present-
ed to all the fraternities.

Sigma Nu, along with two
other fraternities, voted approv-
al of the original program when
it was presented but in no way
sponsored it originally.
