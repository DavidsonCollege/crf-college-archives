Student’s Store???

Through the years at Davidson Col-

Tege, the Student Store, under student
managership, has served our student body
with low prices and honor system open
counter service. We were always of the
opinion, and I think rightly so,-that one
of the main objects of this business was
not to make profits on a large scale but
rather to make the store truly for the
students, who are not in general men of
the higher income bracket. That was in
the past. Try and grab a bite at the
“Stud” now and see if you can come out
under thirty or forty cents. This seems
to us to be out of line with the policies of
a store which is supposed to put large
profits in the background. Not only is this
true of the food, but of supplies, and other
commodities. The stores in town are in
some cases actually under selling a store
which has always been the most economi-
cal on the hill. We must take into con-
sideration that prices have jumped every-
where, and it is admitted that labor costs
are at an all time high, yet we are stiil in
doubt as to whether this would make
things as high as they are if the store was
really being run for the students on a low
profit basis.

Public Speaking...

To put it mildly, appearing before the
Davidson student body is an ordeal. A
student needs all the courage that he is
able to muster to confront so critical an
audience. In fact, dtie needs more than
courage; one needs instruction and “know
how” which can only be gained through
painful experience or through competent
instruction. One of the greatest needs at
Davidson today is a course in public speak-
ing. Davidson graduates (inteligent, well
educated men) leave Davidson with only
the slightest knowledge of the subject. We
expect our alumni to be the leaders of to-
morrow, and yet this can never be unless
our graduates are properly prepared to
stand on their feet before the crowd and
‘make their influence be felt.

The Davidsonian

NG:

Iditor of
Davidsonian,

Dear led:

It is rather:late to discover the reason
tor the decline in the old Davidson spirit,
but | am submitting it for what it is worth
and the good it may do in seasons to come.

During last week, that famous David-
Son spirit consisted of three very feeble

“eat Richmond’s” in chapel, a few dis-

gusting “Fights!” during the fourth per-
iod touchdown drive our ’Cats engineered
against the Spiders,.and the rest of the
would be cheers were on the dormitory,
where many a shout issued forth from
those showing their spipi® by listening to
the Army Notre Dame game instead ot
supporting their own boys.

After much pondering, T think that |
have stumbled on the reason for the’ de-
cline. We veterans constitute over sixty
percent of the student body, and the trou+
ble lies with Us. We seem to think it’s kid
stulf to go down-and yell our lungs out
for the team. Stuff like that is for Fresh-
men, not men! If it were a Freshman
team, this would be a question indeed
and entirely up to the individual. But
among those Freshmen on the field are
a bunch of vets who play their hearts out
along with the next guy. We watched
out for our buddies in the big fight. Why
don’t we watch out.for them in these smal-
er fights?

It takes spirit and lots of it to make a
fourth period touchdown against big boys
the way our team did. They had spirit,
even when the chips were down, even when
it seemed so hard. As easy as it is to
support them and as much as it must mean
to them to get a little backing from the
sidelines, | wonder why we haven't got-
ten on the ball sooner.

It still isn’t too late. How about all of
us old men, a score years old and therea-
bouts, shaking off our wartime “tough-
ness” dnd being our own kiddish., (it
that’s what it takes) selves! !

A Veteran Anon.
Editor of The Davidsonian

Dear Ed:-

Just a note before leaving the campus
to commend the Davidson student body
for carrying on the finest of all David-
son traditions,.the wildcat fighting heart.
It is gratifying, to say the least, to find
that even a global war was unable to da-
mage the will to fight on when things were
looking black.

When a team is in the red by four
touchdowns, in the final period of play,
and with no possibility of leaving the field
victorious, and still fights its way .to a
score against-a superior foe, it has some-

and more important yet was the fact that
it wasn’t just the team on the field but
the team in the stands that didn’t give
up. That greater team, the Davidson Stu-
dent body, will always have something that
the other schools large or small never ob-

and their fighting heart. So may it al-
ways be.

thing inside that turns defeat into victory,

“tain, so hats off to the Davidson men}

Throttlebottle the Terrible has
come and gone once more after
viving me a glimpse of his mightily-
swollen left arm, still aching from
the vicious penetrations of the Da-
vidson doctor who administered my

boy his influenza shot last week.
Regatso was extremely perturbed
over the whole affair since he had
to buy himself—a-new~ T-shirt2
size larger than he usually wears.

As a consequence one side of him
(one might be moved to
question the expression ‘one side’)
and the other side is swollen out
of all proportion. Regatso has
expressed the desire that I relate
to you his experience at tse infir-
mary since he is unable to appear
in chapel as was planned. The idea
was to convey to the students and
faculty a typical (7?) student’s
opinion on the shots, not to men-
tion the doctors.

droops

I quote from Throttebottle: “As
I approached the entrance to the
infirmary, I saw a great mob of
trembling humans formed into a
semblance of a line before the door.
Suddenly I heard a blood-curdling
shriek coming from the top of the
building, and a frantic freshman
was seen standing on the edge of
the roof, gazing with horror be-
hind him. Into view then came a
big hulking doctor carrying threat-
eningly a huge needle of about two
feet in length. The freshman took

death on the cement below rather
than be caught. The doctor wiped
his instrument of death on _ his
sleeve, grinned wryly, and went
back. All this did little to help
my state of mind, especially when
I saw men emerging from sick-
bay and collapsing into prepared
stretchers to be hauled away to the
refuse pile. On the inside numer-
ous jittery juniors were banded
together praying and ministerial
students were kept busy giving last

one last look and plunged to, his}.

rites to their buddies. Every now
and then a low moan or a terrify-
ing shriek would issue from the
interior, and once two doctors armed
with needles, not square or pointed,
but more of an octagon shape,
chased a sobbing sophomore into
the cellar. An ensuing struggle
was heard, and then silence. One
ef the doctors returned, —blood-
stained but triumphant. As I drew
nearer the massacre, my knees
weakened. When it was time for
my pal, who was in front of me,
to get his shot, I watched eagerly.
A doctor stood on each side of him
and took target practice at each
arm. Several hits were ‘scored,
but the doctors weren’t satisfied
until one needle went all the way;
through his arm. His funeral serv-
ices will be held in the college
church on Monday. My turn was
next, but I foiled them! Just as
the medicos, harboring wicked
gleams in their green eyes, pounced
on me, I picked up a chair and
crowned myself over the head, thus
avoiding the torture involved in
the slaughter to come. I can truth-
fully say that I have 58 holes in
my two arms, one terrific scab
where, they finally connected, a
huge lump and brain concussion
where I hit myself, but I ain’t
gonna catch the flu. Boy, ain’t that
serum wonderful ?”

I, as a summarizer, cannot add

modern medicinal methods in our
revered infirmary. Regatso has
done a noble job with his first-hand
(or arm) report. We of the Da-
vidson student body should be very
thankful that the serum was avail-
able to us. Our sympathies must
all go with Sir Throttlebottle for
his present swollen condition, but
at least we may rest assured in
the knowledge that such a valuable
correspondent as my boy is safe

from the flu,

Down Fraternity Court

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON
With signs of a full recuperation
of the chapter after Homecoming?
the gates were opened wide for the
week end and the flood surged foyth
engulfing young and old, women
and children, “Pagans and Pres-
byterians.”

Greenville threw up a barricade
but too late to prevent Brother
McAllister and pledges Sample. R:
Little and White from seeping
through to the Converse dance
while Brothers Grimball, Carrow,
McGeachy and Pledge Bruce floated
in for alumni Brother Mac Bruce’s
wedding. Brother Ashmore who
also made the trip, holds fond mem-
ories of soft lights, sweet music
and the Greenville Country Club
and has been heard singing the
first eight bars of “Somebody Else
Has Taken Your Place.”

The chapter has tried to keep it
a secret too long, but as with all
good things the news gets around
so for official release here it is:
Mrs. Elkin Has the Best Boarding
House on the Campus, barring none!

PI KAPPA ALPHA
P As yet most of the brothers and
pledges have not fully recuperated
from the’ Homecoming week end
but some seemed to be quite capable
of getting off the campus for
various escapades this past week
end. Saturday afternoon Brothers
Smoak and MeNair left for Wilkes-
boro. Smoak now admits that
everything is “chicken” as far as
the little lady is concerned. Broth-
ers Dockery and Wood seem to
think there is no place like Char-
lotte to spend Saturday night, while
Brothers Shelton and Ensign sing

“There's No Place Like Home”.

Brother Robert Stroup was seen
at the ball game with the belle of
Mt. Holly. Seems that they are
together nearly every week end
now. Pledges Boyd and Fanjoy
were seen Sunday afternoon in the
company with many beautiful young
ladies and they admit that they
were so engrossed they couldn’t
come back to Davidson. A feed
was held at the house Sunday night
and all who were present seemed
to enjoy it. Since the curtailment
on the number of lines allowed in
this column went into effect last
week, guess that’s all for tonight.

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Sam Pharr, anxious to preserve
a good reputation in view of future
expeditions to Randolph-Macon
(Salem girls please note) spent the
week end quietly at home in Moores-
ville. Last week, while snaking
skillfully on several of the trust-
ing brohters, Pharr’s friend of the
moment yelled exasperatedly, “Do
you have-any idea what good clean
fun is?” Sam gleefully replied,
“T’ll bite, what good is it?”

Mrs. TommAlou Larson caught
up with Adolph finally. At the
football game she blocked all his
lone wolf activity by public an-
nouncement over the P. A. system.
The Rock Hill boys, Strait, Jenkins,
Newton, and Poag came back from
home with an odorous joke about
she was only the garbage man’s
daughter, but she was not to be
sniffed at. Tom Clark tore up sev-
eral hearts at Winthrop; Leighton
McKeithan lured two ladies into
seeing the more interesting spots
of the campus; Fireplug Fairly,
part of a party observing opening
ceremonies at El Morocco, reported
a conversation between A. Ragan
and date, to wit: “Do you want to
stop the car and eat, precious?”
“No, pet.”

under any amount of grilling. .

Phikeia’s Band gathered for a
feed at the house following the
services on Sunday night last at
which all Brothers, Pledges, and
their guests were in attendance.

But for “Mullethead’s Manifesto”
severely curtailing the reporting
of Graecian deals, this column
would cover pages attempting to
account the operations of the once
limber Sigmas, for “Moose’s Men”

a very successful homecoming cele-
bration, embracing the dances,
house feeds, and Charlotte Hotel

bull tosser, Awful Alfred Taylor.

During the past week end, most
of the renowned wheels slowed
down to the extent of taking in
Mr. Ringling’s~ extravaganza ~in
Charlotte. \It was a case of “beau-
ties and the beasts,” the latter of
course referring to those owned by
the circus, as Brothers Amos, Tay-
lor, Currie, Lawson, Coffey, P. Wil-
liams, M. Williams, and Pledge
Cheek escorted their respective
lovelies to the big show. » Cheek
returned with the nickname “Feath-
ers,” bestowed by his date who
avowed the lean Alabaman was
the biggest chicken she’s ever met
from Davidson.

Delta Theta continued its series
of deals for the year over the week
end. Brothers Sutton, Newell, and
Tate were quite in evidence with
three Queens lovelies at the Rich-
mond fracas while it is rumored
that Brothers McLean, Oglesby and
Co. took over the night shift with
the same group of fems. Brother
Richardson was off to Decatur on
urgent business while Brother Shel-
ton Colson sat wide-eyed and sor-
rowful in his lonely room, dream-
ing of his fair maid in Jax.
Brother Robertson was reported
in gigantic operations in the Queen
City. A broad cloak of ‘secrecy
shrouds all movements of Brother
O. E. Starnes who won’t loosen up

fined to the college infirmary (com-
plete with hot and cold. running
chills) for the past week. Brothers
are urged to visit John and quicken
the weary hours.

Last but certainly not least, the
heartfelt congratulations of all
Betas on the hill go to Lamar Wil-
liamson who has been tapped into
Omicron Delta Kappa: within this

Happy memories of a very suc-
cessful Homecoming still linger on
in many of the KA minds. The
banquet, dances, feed, and natural-
ly, the girls combined to make it
the best week end thus far.
