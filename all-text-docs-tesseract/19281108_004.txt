Col. A. L. Gaston, '96, of Chester, S.
C., has accepted the invitation extend-
ed him by the Davidson College Alum-
ni Council to speak here on Home-
coming Day, November 17. Col. Gas-
ton will address the alumni, students
and friends of the college at the sta-
dium after the R. O. T. C. battalion
stages a parade on Sprunt Field,

The principal speaker for Homecom-
ing has attained quite a reputation as
a lawyer, and is frequently asked to
address gatherings of all kinds in
South Carolina. Since he obtained his
bachelor of law degree after gradu-
ating from Davidson he has steadily
advanced in his profession, and ranks
high in the confidence and esteemyof
the people of South Carolina, which
received expression when they elected
him to the House of Representatives
of that state.

Most of the arrangements for the
big celebration at Davidson on Novem-
ber 17 have been completed, though
many minor details must be
out before that time. An invitation,
accompanied by a miniature alumni
newspaper and a blank for ticket res-
ervations, was mailed to Davidson
alumni everywhere by the alumni sec-
retary this week.

The program for iiie day will be
similar to the ones in recent years, be-

alumni luncheon in the gymnasium,

which is to be given over WBT, Char-
lotte,-on Tuesday night, November
13, 8 to 8:30 o'clock.

As the time for the annual return
of alumni approaches, officials of the
alumni association are becoming more
confident that a record number of
alumni will pay the college a visit. A
greater number of classes and states
will be represented than heretofore.
It is definitely known that alumni will
be here from Pennsylvania, Oklahoma,
Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia,
and North Carolina. Reservation for
tickets early next week will reveal the
approximate number who expect to
return.

dents’ interest so that it may be a real
benefit to the battalion. This competition
will start in the parade Wednesday, No-
vember 7. Last year a great deal of
interest was derived; the people from
town viewing the parade, offered their
opinions as to what platoon had the best

importance and ultimate reality of spirit-
ual values.

Yet a faith of conviction and obedience
is not enough without an appreciation of
the beauty found in the life of Jesus and
in His teachings. Beauty, not in the or-
dinary sense as applied to flowers and
poetry, but in the deepest meaning, is
as important as knowledge, for no man
would or could worship Jesus if it were
not for the beauty of His soul. It is this
beauty that stirs the heart of man and
prompts him to great deeds.

These human elements of intelligence,
vigor, and love of beauty plus the divine
aid of the presence of Jesus will give us
a faith whose fruits can be tested by the
demands of life and not be found wanting.

Coach Is Looking for Permanent
Bachelors

Doc” Stewart of the School of Mines,
branch of the University of Texas, built a
good team last year, but it had one weak-

ness, its romantic heart. Cupid made
touchdown after touchdown,
Six of Doe’s players have discarded

moleskins and pigskins. A seventh has
married, but may return to the gridiron
anyway. Stewart is looking for an entire
team for the season of 1928,

Even before the season started last year
Blain, McNutt, bidding for the backfield,
married Laura Pearcy, of El Paso. , Then
Halfback Lee Cherry Smith, star broken
field runner, heard the signal for the
eternal knot formation and was thrown
for a loss by Martha Pearcy, McNutt’s
sister-in-law. Meanwhile, Billy Clark,
tackle, got his signals crossed and rushed
away to marry Eleanor Gosset, of Austin.
That ended the first half.

Then, in April, Felix Ducharme, half-
back, and Alice Rodehaver, of El Paso,
and Buster Smith, lineman, and Lulene
Crowder, also of El Paso, figured in a
double pass that gained valuable yardage
for Cupid. Bill Bulger, guard and tackle,
married Lola Mae Crowder, of Las
Cruces, in June. Then Bill Powell, end,
and Freda Gibson, of Monahans, were
married in the middle of the summer.

whips into shape will be composed entire-
ly of bachelors who want to stay that way.

Co-eds, according to, Brewer, show far
less interest in the football games than
did their sisters of 10 years ago—unless
the men offer to take'them. And as a re-
sult, he has pointed out, salesmen of ath-
letic ticket coupons are laughed at when
approaching sorority groups. “They’ve
lost their institutional spirit,” te declares.
“They're grafters.”

All this has brought stinging retorts
from the co-ed population of “Columbia.
“Nothing of the sort,” they return.

“False,” says Miss Lois Jacquin, secre-
tary-treasurer of the student government
association, in her reply to Brewer’s
charge that the co-eds fail to buy tickets.
She cites her own sorority as an example,
asserting that its members attend the foot-
ball games-in a body. “Perhaps girls
have degenerated into a bunch of grafters,
but why blame the girls? The boys take
the initiative—why not let them pay the
bill?”
