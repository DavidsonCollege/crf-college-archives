A Conversation With President Spencer

(This week, DAVIDSONIAN Editor Alec Hoon and
Managing Editor Bob Howell discussed with College
President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. how the college has
changed since his arrival in 1968.)

DAVIDSONIAN: What do you see as
the high points in your years at
Davidson?

Spencer: First of all, I want to em-
phasize that the positive changes that
have occurred have been the products
of the work and thought of a lot of
people, not just personal ac-
complishments.

One of the primary changes that have
taken place in the community was the
decision to enlarge the student body
from around 1000 people to 1500 - 1600. It
was felt that we could keep the small.
residential college nature at that level.

Obviously, one of the most important
aspects of that decision was that the ad-
ditional 500 - 600 students would be
women.

Along with the larger student body
was the basic decision to make the
library a much larger building. This in-
volved changes in the whole concept of
a new library. including financial
aspects.

In the area of academics, what we've
been doing is fleshing out the Blue Sky
curriculum which was adopted about
five years ago.

The Honors College was a feature of
that program, and I think that, having
gotten under way as it has, it’s a good
base from which to move ahead.

The South Asia program also has
been successful in many ways, though
it has not grown in terms of student in-
terest as much as we had hoped.

Concerning the foreign study
grogram in India with the University of
Baroda, there has been no more
progress due _ to _ international
diplomatic problems, though we still
hope to pick it up again and have it ap-
proved by the Indian government.

The Extended Studies program is
another area that I think is a very im-
portant aspect, insofar as it enables
students to relate nonclassroom ex-
perience to classroom experience as a
part of their education. Currently the
program is being evaluated to insure
that work done is of high quality and
demanding.

DAVIDSONIAN: Are there any
aspects of the past few years which you
think could have been handled better?

Spencer: I think one of the areas we
have not moved very fast in but have at
least made beginnings in is the whole
question of making a better situation
for minority students. Numbers here

have grown very slowly despite efforts
to increase them.

We're just beginning to get minority
members into the professional staff,
and I hope very much that that will con-
tinue and that we will make faster
progress than we have.

DAVIDSONIAN: Do you have any
regrets about the decision to restruc-
ture the social system? How do you
think it’s working?

Spencer: I don't have any regrets
about the decision. Everybody agreed
that the fraternity system was
deteriorating. and it seeed to me that it
Was a policy of wisdom and courage to
do something and not sit back and let it
just fall apart.

I think it remains to be seen how wise
the way the changes were made will
prove to be. I believe it will take at least
a college generation to sift out what's
good. to modify it and make it the best
we can get.

The big gain is that we no longer have
a situation in which some percentage of
the freshman class — early in the year
— felt themselves branded as socially
inferior.

DAVIDSONIAN: How do you see
your role as president in regard to the
the two areas of academics and finan-
cial development?

Spencer: I would personally not be in-
terested in a college presidency which
was purely fund raising or purely ad-
ministrative. Things have become so
complex, but in a college of our size I
still think it is possible for the president
to exercise a role in the entire opera-
tion of the college.

The president should have and ex-
press, I think, overall objectives and
ideals, and should put the weight of his
office behind these through the faculty
and the other officers of the college, and
be one to keep pushing to see that these
things are carried out.

DAVIDSONIAN: Considering the
need for funding of such programs as
the new Union and new housing, what
will be the respective roles of the
development office and yourself?

Spencer: You certainly need an
adequate development staff, but there
is always the question of whether we
are spending too much on staff for what
we're getting back. This is very dif-
ficult to measure.

Now, there are certain calls which
the president must make, and the role
of the development staff is to organize
the development effort in such a way
that, at the appropriate time and
Situation, the president can be best
used.

SPENCER
ort:

It takes time for a staff like this to get
moving, and we've had to start almost
from scratch, but we've made some
definite progress. With the annual fund
and the Wildcat Club, for example,
we've raised the total to more than
$400,000. whereas up until three years
ago we'd never raised more than
$200,000.

DAVIDSONIAN: What are your
thoughts on the distance between the
president and the student body?

Spencer: This is a problem for all
college presidents. more today than
ever. There was a day when things
were less complex, when there were
fewer time consuming things to do on
the administrative level. when
presidents had more time to spend with
both students and faculty.

This year I've been away more than
ever because of the Queens-Davidson
campaign, and it's a real frustration.
Having been dean of students here, I'm
conscious of and would like to have the
kind of relationship with students |
know is possible.

Two ways we've been trying to ease
the problem are through the dean of
students and by choosing a graduating
senior for the position of assistant to the
president. Even so. after this fund-
raising campaign is over, I hope I can

pick up on things I used to do in con-
nection with students.

DAVIDSONIAN: Do you think there
has been any communication break-
down between the administration and
the faculty?

Spencer: My ideal is that all groups
who work on this campus feel they are
part of a common enterprise, not
categorized and split into divergent
groups.

There will be some disagreement bet-
ween and within students, faculty and
administration, but I don't like always
to see one group set against the others.

Undoubtedly, we in the = ad-
ministration have made mistakes, we
should've perhaps gotten more of an in-
dication of faculty or student feeling
before making certain decisions; I hope
in the future we can do better.

DAVIDSONIAN: What do you see as
some of the significant steps the college
has made this year?

Spencer: I think we've made real
strides in alumni relations. A lot of
alumni were upset about fraternities.

missiveness"’ on the campus. I believe
that most of our alumni who were disen-
chanted have gotten some perspective

Obviously, a big step has been the
beginning of coeducation. | think it was
important to have the women we had
this vear who have given us some un
derstanding of the needs and problems
of women students as they come in as
freshmen next year Another aspect
of significance is the progress made
toward the resolution of the whole
governance question

DAVIDSONIAN: Regarding gover-
nance, do you feel that students should
have a vote in the new governance
system?

Spencer: I've always felt that the
faculty should be the central element in
any legislative body on a college cam
pus.

At the same time, I believe that there
should be a college body of some kind
which includes the entire faculty, but in
which there are students and ad-
ministrative staff people who do have a
vote on matters which appropriately
concern the entire college community.

DAVIDSONIAN: Could you give an
example of a typical day as president?

Spencer: There isn't really a typical
day, but it runs everywhere from in-
terviewing a new faculty member, to
conferences with the staff, to
correspondence which has to be han-
dled, to planning for trustee meetings.
to luncheon and dinner meetings for
fund raising... these kinds of things.

I think the generalization that can be
made is that the job of a college
president is one of infinite variety -
you just never know what's coming up
next
