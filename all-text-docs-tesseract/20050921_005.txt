solving these problems,” Director of
Instructional Support Diane Sterling said.

Epes feels that the decision to curb non-
academic use of classrooms will be support-
ed by the student body.

“T believe that the student body as a whole
wants equipment working in class when they
get there, wants classrooms clean and well
maintained, and wants priorities placed

where they ought to be,” Epes said.

Few students, however, are aware of the
administrations position, and opinion is
often divided.

“I did not know that we could no longer
use these classrooms for entertainment pur-
poses. It really does not make much of a dif-
ference to me as I try to stay as far away
from Chambers as possible in my free time,”
said Keally Miranda ’07.

Other students feel that the administration
would be depriving them of an entertainment
and social outlet. ,

“On the one hand I understand the
College’s need to reduce costs and to pre-

serve the connectivity of devices, but on the -

other hand students whose roonis are without
televisions or who are not satisfied with the
televisions in their lounge will. invariably
suffer,” Colin Brown ’07 said. +

weekends,” Amir Vaez ’07 said.

There are no clear indications on how
extensive classroom misuse actually is.

“We really have no way of knowing how
rampant the usage of the classroom for non-
academic purposes is. We do go to the class-
rooms and monitor the hours of use and try
to prevent an outage during scheduled class
hours, but random use makes this a little
trickier,” Sterling said.

“I don’t believe the usage is rampant at
all, but a combination of occasional encoun-
ters, sometimes by those showing class-
related videos at night, and scuttlebutt indi-

cates that it might be desirable to say some-

thing about the matter before it becomes a
major problem,” Epes said.
