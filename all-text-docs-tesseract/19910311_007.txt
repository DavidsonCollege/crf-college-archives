Clandestine Presbyterian Sex Plot Uncovered

Well, kiddies, can you guess
what’s going down at your friendly,
neighborhood Presbyterian
church? We bet you couldn’t--
since the number of you that got up
to go to the Gulf Conference is
only slightly fewer than the few of
you who get upand gotochurchon
Sunday.

Far be it from us to comment
on the fact that the “demonstrated
Christian commitment” you dis-
played on the admission applica-
tion was written by the same people
who now have trouble dragging
their lazy butts out of bed before
two o’clock on Sunday afternoon,
and only then because State’s play-
ing Tech at 2:30. In fact, if we
were going to comment on some-
thing like that, we mightalso ques-
tion whether or notit would be nice
if more than two of the faculty
showed up at DCPC once in a blue
moon.

But, we won’t. No, the subject
of this week’s column (since our
ratings have slipped due toserious
journalism) involves SEX!!! !!!!!
How, you may ask your lazy selves,
are we going to combine those two
pastimes most dear to Davidsoni-
ans--church and SEX--into_ the
same space without someone
shouting Hallelujah? Well, you’re
all so darn apathetic that we could

probably say anything we wanted,

short of revealing George Bush’s

Oval Office phone number (which

we know, by the way), and nobody

would say a word. Such is life.
Anyway, back to

Topeka, it's a different matter en-
tirely when a newspaper like the
Observer (on the level of, say. . .
The NY Postor Hard Copy) makes
the same statement. So, since there

appears to be some legitimate

church make room for adultery
and ‘responsible sex’ among
singles in a revised ethic designed
to be more relevant to contempo-
rary life.”

Interested yet? The regular

SEX. And church. If
you’ ve been diligently
reading your copy of
the Presbyterian Lay-
man (and we know
that you have), you’re
already aware that
there’s some pretty
interesting stuff in the
Feb. 1991 issue. It's
the same issue with
that article entitled,
“Mission. Worker
Labels Sandinista
Mass Murders ‘Inter-
nal Matters.”” Maybe
it is the National
Enquirer for Presby-

Presbyterians were;
according to the Ob-
server, a group of Pres-
byters (or whatever
they’re called) had to
postpone their meeting
at Hilton Head an extra
day to plot strategies to
kill this report. Al-
ready, this seemingly
innocent documenthas
caused mayhem, forc-
ing pious Presbyterians
to spend an extra day at
worldly, sinful Hilton
Head (oh, the sacrifice)
just to come up with a
suitable response. How

terians. But the head-

line on the cover, “G. A. Task
Force Revises Sex Ethic,” was
interesting enough to read the
whole article (maybe there are
pictures, maybe therearen’t--we’re
not saying).

When The Charlotte Observer
tan essentially the same story on
its front-page, we really took no-
tice. It's one thing to have the
National Enquirer report aliens in

news here (known in journalistic
termsas ‘An Easy Target’), we felt
compelled to bring you the gory
details.

Tell that to Moses. Far be it
from us to condemn those who go

“Thou shalt not steal?” Release

simply acontinuation of that tradi-

Let. Them .Get Ahead

By Kelly Crews
The origins of female bonding
can be traced back to the most

primitive hunting and gathering

tribes, in: which women were left
alone to gather food; cook meals,
and care for children. During the
long male absences, tribal women,
bound together by their common
plight, established intimate rela-
tionships among themselves. This
close comraderie between women
remained virtually unknown tomen
until the feminist mévement and
the founding of consciousness-rais-
ing groups.

All of a sudden men realized
women were a step ahead - acon-
ceptthe male ego couldnotendure.
Making a mad dash to achieve the
closeness, intimacy and empower-
ment that women had known for
centuries, men searched for their
own forms of male bonding. Some
men organized male-only church
groups, some spent thousands of
dollars for week-long nature ex-
cursions, and still others found
solace in Robert Bly’s Iron John:
Men, however, need notmake such
an effort, for male bonding is only:
as far away as Davidson College.

The first place that male bond-
ing occurs is on the athletic fields.
Here, Davidson men express their
support and compassion for their

teammates with a tender butt-slap_

or the ever so gentle helmet-head-
butt, _ Hugging is reserved for
women and homosexuals.

Sports-oriented bonding also.

occurs college men watch football.
Every Monday night, united in a

common goal, and sitting side by

side around their electronic idol,
they share their innermost frustra-
tions and triumphs. “Can you
believe that call?” “What are you
blind? That guy was in!” Notonly
do they soul-search, but every so
often they look toacompanion and
indulge themselves in physical
intimacy - a high five.

While sports satisfy some
men’s desire for malerelationships,
other Davidson students, search-
ing for something more private,
join fraternities. Built on the glo-
rification of the male, these or-
ganizations offer their members
closeness through a variety of
unique bonding experiences.

The most crucial element of a
fraternity isits exclusion of women.
To this end, each organization has
secret meetings, oaths and hand-
shakes. Further attempting to set
themselves apart, fraternal groups
have even created their own trade-
mark drinks - the hairy buffalo and
the bullfrog punch. Yet, these
tactics finally proved too secre-
tive. The fraternities’ activities
were notenvied, nor, actually even
noticed. They had failed to bond
properly. Correct male bonding
has to be bold and noticeable.
Fraternity men, admired for their
intellect, were quick to develop
bonding logos. These symbols
previously known as Greek letters
come in a wide array of combina-
tions, but when translated, they all
say the same ‘thing ~ “Notice me,
I’m malebonding.”*)"

Fraternities should notbe criti-
