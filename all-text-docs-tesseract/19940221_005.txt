This Week in Washington
Russia pressures Serbs to withdraw

By Brett Marston

Taking the West by surprise,
Russian officials announced on
Thursday that they have persuaded
the Serbs tocomply with the recent
NATO ultimatum, which threat-
ens the Serb forces around Sarajevo
with air strikes unless they move
their artillery away from the city.

Deputy Foreign Minister
Vitaly I. Churkin met with Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at
the end of the week to negotiate a
plan which would bring 800 Rus-
sian peacekeeping troops into

Bosnia if the Serbs comply with

NATO demands.

“We can say that any airstrikes
on Bosnian Serb positions are ruled
out,” Churkin announced on Thurs-
day, according to the New York
Times, “for the simple reason that
there will be no targets for these
. Strikes.”°

UN military spokesman Lieut.
Col. Bill Aikman confirmed that

the Serbs around Sarajevo are on.

the move. “Literally, they’re mov-
ing out in convoys, not in indi-
vidual vehicles,” he said on Thurs-
day. “Clearly there’s a major with-
drawal going on.”

On February 9th, NATO
pledged to begin air strikes of
Serbian positions around Sarajevo
unless the Serbs move their heavy
artillery to positions twenty kilo-
meters from the city or turn the
weapons over to-.UN. forces in-the
area by 1:00 AM local time on
February 21.

NATO also threatened to or-
der air strikes sooner if Serbs con-
tinue their shelling of the Bosnian
capital.

Further. the NATO ultimatum —
urges the Bosnian government to
“refrain from attacks launched from
within the current confrontation
lines in the city,” and to place their
artillery under UN control.

Admitting that “neither we nor
anyone else can impose a peace
with military actions,” U.S. De-
fense Department spokesman
Walter Slocombe announced in a
press conference on Feb. 10th that
NATO intends to “show resolve”
and “reduce the kind of carnage we
saw last weekend,” referring to the
Serbian mortar attack on the cen-
tral market in Sarajevo which left
68 people dead and 200 wounded.

On the Wednesday after this
attack, UN Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali wrote a let-
ter to NATO leaders reminding
them. of the UN resolution from
last July which names Sarajevo a
“safety zone,” arid recalling a
NATO statement from Jan. 11th
which threatens the Serbs with air
strikes should the war in Bosnia
continue.

Ghali urged NATO leaders to
make preparations for air strikes.

In a statement on Feb. 9th,
President Clinton presented justi-
fications for NATO’s move. “We
have an interest in showing that
NATO, history’s greatest military
alliance, remains a credible force

for peace in post cold-war Europe,”
Clinton declared,:according to the

New York Times: “We have an
interest in stemming the destabi-
lizing flows of refugees that this
horrible conflict is creating. And
we clearly have a humanitarian
interest in helping to prevent the

- strangulation of Sarajevo and the —
continuing slaughter of innocents
in Sarajevo.”

Originally, neither the Rus-
sians nor the Serbs showed much
enthusiasm for NATO demands.

Soon after NATO issued the
ultimatum, the French newspaper
Le Monde quoted a Bosnian Serb
official as saying that “the first
victim of intervention will be the
muslim army [and T]he second
victims will be the ‘blue helmets,’”
referring to the UN peacekeeping
troops.

Just days after the NATO de-
cision, Russian Foreign Minister
Andrei V. Kozyrev sent a letter to
Boutros-Ghali, announcing that
Russia would veto any NATO op-
eration put before the UN Security
Council.

The Russian announcement
last week and Serb compliance with
NATO’s demands could amount

to new chances for peace around —

Sarajevo.

Karadzic himself seemed op-
timistic. “We are going toward the
end of the war at least in Sarajevo,”
he said on Thursday, again accord-
ing to the New York Times, “and

that may be the introduction of the

end of the war in all Bosnia and
Hercegovina.” —

Karadzic has made similar
pronouncements before. But if

this peace lasts, and NATO isn’t
forced to follow through on their

threats, then a new, slightly more
hopeful phase of the Balkan war
may have just begun.

NOTES

Generation X ...a myth?

“This generation, they wrote last year in the Atlantic, is the
product of a ‘countermood popping up in college towns, in big cities,
on Fox and cable TV. It’s a tone of physical frenzy and spiritual
numbness, a revelry of pop, a pursuit of high tech, guiltless fun. . . .
A generation weaned on minimal expectations and gifted in the game
of life.'

There’s just one problem with all of this thumb-sucking on
behalf of America’s young adults. It seems that disaffected
Twentysomethings appear to exist only in the fervid imaginations of
a few writers and pop psychologists, claims political scientist Everett
Ladd in the latest issue or Public Perspective.

Areview ofsurvey data suggests to Ladd that young adults aren’t
more or less optimistic than other generations about their personal
condition or the future of the country, nor do they feel they’ve been
given the short end of the of the economic stick by their greedy
parents.

For example, they noted that two years ago the Gallup Organi-
zation asked a random sample of Americans whether, ‘in general, are
you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your
personal life?” Among those 18 to 29 years old, only 18% expressed
dissatisfaction with their lives, compared to 22% of those 30 to 49

Shi, Ortmayer speak on Vietnam as part of Dean Rusk forum

By rhe Clare Jalonick
Changes in American foreign
policy affected by the Vietnam War
were addressed by Dr. David E.
Shi and Dr. Louis Ortmayer in
“Interventionism: the Vietnam
Syndrome, Past and Present.” Shi,
former Davidson history depart-
ment chair, and Ortmayer,
Davidson political science profes-
sor, delivered their lecture in con-
junction with the Dean Rusk, Na-
tions Bank conference on “Con-
science and Foreign Policy.”
According to David Shi,
Vietnam was a “highly ambigu-
ous, highly civil struggle.”
Shi began by giving an ac-
count of the emotional and physi-
cal toll taken by the war. 2.5 mil-

lion were killed, including 58,000
Americans killed and
4 BT injured. Soldiers re-
‘|turned with severe
psychological and
physical scars.

Although these
Statistics are comparable to any
war in which America has been
involved, Shi says Vietnam was
different because it left Americans
“with a sense of bad conscience.”
“Vietnam affected all of us,” he
said.

One of the most immediate
effects of the war was the Vietnam
Syndrome, a new attitude in Ameri-
can government. Many politicians
claimed that America ought never
toengage in military conflict again

The Dean Rusk Program
Newsletter to spread word about International Student Association

By Saad Gul
The International Newsletter
will serve as a forum for Davidson
students who wish to share per-
sonal international experiences
with others who are interested.
The new project is a joint
venture initiated by the Interna-
tional Student Association and the
Dean Rusk Student Advisory Com-
mittee.
The aim of the newsletter is to
enhance interaction between inter-

national and American students at
Davidson, as well as to increase
international awareness among the
student body as. a whole .

In the past, functions such as
International Jeopardy, lectures, fo-
rums and discussions have not at-
tracted large numbers of students
partly because students who would
have been interested were unaware
of the events.

unless attacked. There was much
support for the idea of abandoning
military force as a control over
foreign policy.

As the Vietnam decade passed,
attitudes changed again and for-
eign policy shifted towards inter-
ventionism. Shi argues that Ameri-
cans tend toward intervention and
the glorification of war because,
“from the colonial period to the
present, Americans have seen
themselves as divinely ordained.”

Shi believes that the lessons
taught by Vietnam can be valu-
able. “We did not use our political
innocence, for that faded long ago,
but our naive confidence. The tragic
experience can be good. It reminds
nations of their fallibility.”

the campus as a whole informed
about ISA activities, as well as its
nature and aims. The organization
is open to all students, but few

Ortemayer spoke about the
recent grapplings with the Viet-
nam syndrome. George Bush
claims that “the Vietnam Syndrome
has been laid to rest.” Ortemayer
believes otherwise.

He hopes that the current gov-

in dealing with such conflicts to-
day as Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia.
