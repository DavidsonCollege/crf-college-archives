VICTORY.

grounds. Carolina had a well-balanced
team, and showed that thev had able
coaching under “Gi” Guerrant. “Babe
Adams, who relieved “Big” Mills,
pitched a good game. Shuler, at third:
Edens. at first, and Plexico, in center
field, all plaved a fine game, For Dav-
idson the pitching of Osteen stood out
prominently, while Flliott, behind the
plate, caught a great game. The bat-
ting of the entire team also featured.
Stough made a difficult catch in center.
Cravton nipped a liner before it could
touch, and Somerville made a_beautiful
hare-hand stop at second. The game
thoughout was full of ginger.

Dave Hevwood,. one of the fastest
men in the South, had to be carried off
the field when he sprained his knee slid-
ing back to first.

THE SEASON REVIEWED.

and Boggs;

When the curtain fell on the 1914
base ball campaign a “good taste” was
left for every Davidsonian, when one of
our greatest rivals was overwhelmingly
defeated. .

Both in foot ball as in base ball, Dav-
idson almost invariably has the good
buck of closing the season in either a

viet rv or Wstring of victories—making
a rang fi ale,"Las it were. Looking
at the-geason isd whole it has been a

credit to Davidson, and except for the
bad breaking of luck in several of the
carly games, it would have been a glor-
ious success. For next vear the prospects
are the. brightest that Davidson has ever
had for only one man on the team will
graduate. and. therefore, evervane else
should be hack, and Davidson should
put out the best team that has ever ren-
resented this College. and should easily
win the South Atlantic championship.
Resides the eresent Varsity and Scrub
meg, there should be several good men
ja ‘the Class of 1918. —

ATHLETIC NOTES.

_ At a meeting of the Athletic Execn-
tive Committee it was decided to sell
season tickets rext vear for Foot Ball.
Base Rall and Track. for $5.00. This
#s a verv reasonable amount in view of
the fact that the holder will oet fully

that amount in ames on the Hill.

The movine picture show will be
run next vear bv Enoch Faw and Lex
Kluetz for the inint benefice of the An-
nual and the Athletic Association,

°

The Track team elacted Gilchrist
captain for next year, and N. Johnson
manager.

Glancine back over the season, we
recall the fact that the early part of the
se-con this locality had much snow and
rain. and the field being of clay, it was
rendered unfit for service for some time.
This was a great handicap to the team.
and Coach especially. since several new
plavers had to be developed. “Practice
makes perfect,” but when a team can't
practice, it can't become verfect. This
fact, together with the fact that many

off Adams. 6.].
El-|

of the big games came at
of the season, is responsible for several
of the vames lost by a very close score.
After the team did get to going good, it
was hard to stop them. Out of the last
6 games. § of them were won bv a good
margin, and the other was lost in one
inning when several errors were made.
Three of these victories were over three
of our biggest rival-—U. of N. C..
Wake Forest and U. of S.C. As the
season neared its end the team got bet-
ter and better until in its final shape it
is to be much doubted whether anv
team in the South Atlantic could win
aver the “Red and Black Machine.”
One thing that must be said of the en-
tire team is, that thev had plenty of the
old-time Davidson pep. and in every
single game they put up a scrappy and
pepperv game until the last ball was
thown.

Captain Cravton has made a splendi¢
leader for the team, and in every gam

of pep. Christenburv leads the team in
number of scores made. Davidson dur-
ing the season tallied 80 runs to our op-
ponents’ 47, and of this number Christy
made 15. He also leads in walking.
taking 8 trips bv this route. He and
Kluttz, tie in number of bases stolen,
each getting 11. Out of his 14 hits he
secured 3 doubles and a triple. Somer-
ville was second in number of bases on
balls. Brown leads the team with the
stick at .368. Out of his 7 hits he
secured a double and a triple.

The pitching staff has been strong this
vear with Osteen and Currie. Thev
have beth pitched superb ball through-
out the season. Murphy had a bistered
finger, and was sick at the first of the
season, which kept him from pitching
more games. In the first U. of S. C.
and ake Forest games he showed
that he had plenty of stuff: Osteen has
vitched the majority of gamés, and has
certainly pitched great ball and worked
hard. Bill has been chosgh as captain
for next year. and well deserves this
honor. Stough leads in, heavy § hitting
and in number of hits. ut of his 20
he got § doubles and ¢ triples. Klurtz
tied Christenburv for number of bases
stolen, and was second in batting. Out
of 18 hits he secured 2 doubles and 4
triples.

There were 9 “D. C.'s” awarded to
