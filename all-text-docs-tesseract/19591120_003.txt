SIDELINES
ON SPORTS

By B. MILLNER

LAST WEEK, this columnist was subjected to the

criticisms of a trio of irate cheerleaders who aired their
views in the “Letter to the Editor” columns of this news-
paper,

Perhaps these criticisms were justified, perhaps
not. In any case, this writer would like to offer some
constructive criticism of his own. We sincerely hope
that the readers do not misconstrue these suggestions
and criticisms as a means of “hitting back” or of re-
taliation. This is not our intent.

FIRST, we feel that the cheerleaders, on occasion,
have been. inadequate. Only about half of the cheerlead-
ing squad was “in uniform” for the Lehigh game last
week. Organized yells during the second half were
sporadic and not a single effective yell was led during
the fourth quarter goal-line stand in which the Wildcat
line held Lehigh on the two-yard-line for four downs.

Second, the cheerleaders have, at times, lacked
organization. The pep rally before the P.C. game was
superbly organized, but the “burying of the Wofford
Terrier” just before the Homecoming game was not
even seen by half of the spectators.

THIRD, an efficient public address system and a
Jeader’s platform would make cheers twice’ as effective.
This is one area in which the athletic department could,
and should, help out. If modification of the P.A. system is
impossible, hand megaphones should be provided.

Fourth, the -procedure of selecting cheerleaders
should be improved. Try-outs or “auditions” might be
a solution. Perhaps the selection of the Chief Cheer-
feader should be done by student body election.

Davidson Suffers Worst Season Since ’53

GREENVILLE, S. C.—
Davidson’s undermanned
Wildcats stumbled to their
worst loss of the season
here this afternoon as Fur-
man’s opportunistic Purple
Hurricane erupted in the
second half for a 35-7 win.

Furman quarterbacks Billy
Baker and Bob Cante ran and
passed the Wildcats-batty and
took advantage of every David-

HART SCORES
Davidson’s only score came
in the second quarter. Tee Red-
ding passed to George Hart for
32 yards to move deep into
Furman territory. Hart plunged
into the end-zone from the four-

yard line. Bruce Usher kicked
the extra point and pulled. the
‘Cats into a brief 7-7 deadtock
with Furman, which had scored

One thing must be clear by now: Cheerleaders,
with microphones, platforms, mules, or what have you,
can’t make a thousand people cheer who don’t want
to cheer. We'd like to believe that most of the people
who come to Davidson athletic events have at least
a little of that intangible “school spirit.” We hope
that, with some well-organized stimulation, some of it
will someday come to the surface. We'd like to be-
lieve that the cheerleaders aren‘t really wasting their

time.

and sophomore record-breaker

Barry Branch, the Catfish are
a definite threat for a confer-| -

The Davidson Soccer team invades Atlanta tomor-

row to face unpredictable
final game of the season.

The Wildcats of Coach Paul

The Phi Gams, on the strength of four first place finishes, muscled their way
to the Interffaternity wrestling championship Wednesday night. Mustering a total
of 83 points, the Gams commanded a sizeable lead over the SAE's and Sigma Chis,
who tallied 61 and 50 points respectively.

cross-country team ran to a

fourth place in the Southern

Conference meet in Richmond last Mondav.

V.M.1. WINS

The mect was captured by
V.M.1. (39 points); with West
Virginia, second (71 points);
William and Mary, third (79
points); Davidson, fourth (96
points); and Furman, fifth (101
points.

Eckbert came home in third
place with a time of 20:59, his
best of the year, to head the
Wildcat contingent. Dave Gil-
mour, a sophomore, was the.
ninth man across the line, his
time being 21:16.

ALL-CONFERENCE

Both Eckbert and Gilmour
were selected to the eight-man
All-Conference team. Also in-
cluded. on this honorary squad
were Willie Castagnola of
V.P.L, who took home the title,
Baldwin of West Virginia, Hud-
die of V.M.L,, McDougal of
VMI, Spelsbey of West Vir-
ginia, and Williams of V.M.I.

Selection of the team was
based on performance in the
conference meet and also per.

place.

formance throughout the regu-
lar season.

Davidson's chances of placing
higher in the conference were
hurt by the illness of Mac
Brownlee, who ran in the meet
despite his stomach ailment.
Gilmour also was hampered,
his trouble being a severe cold.
ECKBERT AMAZES COACHES

Coach Whittle said of Eck-
bert: “All the coaches were
just amazed at Eckbert. He’s
not a strong boy. He's just got
a lot of intestinal fortitude.
He's the most improved runner
on the team.”

Whittle felt that if Brownlee
had been up to par the ‘Cats
would have probably ended up
in third or possibly second
“However,” he said,
“even with Brownlee, we would
have had no. chance to beat
VMI.”

Brownlee, also a sophomore,
was consistently the third-run-
ning Wildcat during the rege-
lar season.
