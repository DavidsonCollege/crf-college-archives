The greatest advantage of this
plan is that the entire freshmen
class would have a common ex-
perience for four and one-half
month.

This would foster class spirit
and have a unifying effect. There
would be less administrative work
under this plan as compared with
the Rotation Plan.

The greatest disadvantage is
that it would be uneconomical for
the Cafeteria and the boarding
houses, because of the great de-

Tgor Talks To IRC
At Monthly Meet

|

Igor Sviatoslavsky, Davidson's
‘ student from the Middle East, gave
ja talk to the International Rela-
| tions Club at its regular monthly
| meeting in the Green Room of the
i Student Union on Wednesday,
March 4th.

Taking as his topic “Palestine
and The Near East,” Igor gave
a vivid. description and analysis
of the present dilemma in Pales-
tine, After tracing the history of
this important land in world af-
fairs from the Turks to the British,
he then turned his attention on the
controversial Jewish-Arab pro-
blem.

Igor discussed the terrorism em-
plofed by the Jews, such as the
Essenes group, especially in 1946
and said that it helped the British
decide to leave in 1947. At this
time the Jews started coming back
by the hundreds to their home-
land, and also 500,000 displaced
Arabs returned, thus creating an
area of high tension where the
two groups met around Haifa and
Jerusalem.

The war between the two has
been very bitter, and even the
United Nations intervening in the
conflict has brought no lasting
promise of peace. Igor stressed
the fact that the problem is indeed
grave because of the intense na-
tionalism of both the Jews and
