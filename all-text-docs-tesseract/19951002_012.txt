Wine tasting livens up the
weekend what-to-do-blues

You may know that Virginia
is for lovers, but did you realize
that Virginia is also for wine lov-
ers? Home to 46 wineries, Vir-
ginia boasts profuse vineyards and
festive celebrations to promote the
products of these vineyards, the
wines of Virginia.

As the official Virginia Wine
Month, October hosts a plethora of
wine festivals. These events fea-
ture craft shows, live music, and
the finest wines of the state. If you
have never been to a wine or food
festival, then get ready for an inter-
esting and fun experience.

I spent last Sunday at Smith
Mountain Lake’s seventh annual
Wine Festival. I arrived on an
overcast day at the tent-strewn field
full of inquisitiveness and antici-
pation; I was not let down.

Having ordered my ticket in
advance (which saved me $5), I
went to the head of the line, where
I received my wristband and wine
glass with the festival logo. Fif-
teen wineries were represented, and
each had brought with them any-

where from 5-10 selections of their
finest wines. I proceeded from one
tent to the next, tasting select wines
as I browsed among the art exhib-
its and craft stands and listened to
the live band.
I went knowing little about wines,
but through friends and the winery
representatives, I left knowing
much. .
Although my favorite wine
from the entire tasting tour was
mulled from apples — a glorified
cider — several other “real” wines
made quite favorable impressions.
Totier Creek Vineyard presented
their ‘93 Merlot; its distinctive fla-
vor and blend with Cabernet
Sauvignon stole the show. I also
enjoyed Rebec Vineyards’ Autumn
Glow, which is a unique blend of
Reisling and Pinot Noir.

By this point, I am sure you
are wondering how to experience
the food, wine, music, and dis-
count prices on wine purchases for
yourself. One of the best bets is to
escape to the region between
Charlottesville and Culpeper on
the weekend of October 14,15.
Four vineyards (marked by *) in
that area host fall festivals that

weekend, with barrel tasting, semi-
nars, vineyard tours, hayrides, and
sampling of new fall releases. Also
that weekend, at Rebec Vineyards
is the 5th Annual Garlic Festival,
where five Virginia wineries will
be exhibited amongst festival fan-
fare. On October 28, try Jazz on
the Lawn at Stonewall Vineyards,
with tastings and tours; that same
day, Rose Bower Vineyard pre-
sents the Autumn Color Festival
with similar activities.

I advise calling ahead and ac-
quiring tickets for the festivals, as
well as getting specific directions
and times.

If you want to turn a wine
festival weekend into a relaxing
get-away, I suggest checking into
a bed and breakfast inn. These are
comparable in price to staying in a
hotel, but with atmospheres which
make you feel like an individiual
and not just a name on a computer
screen.

Once again, if you have ques-
tions or comments, please contact
me through voice mail box 3389,

keting Program at (800) 828-4637.
Cheers! :

toroom, questioning students about
their languages, cultures, home
lives and even governments.
Susanne K6nig, a one year interna-
tional from Germany said, “I think
it is interesting once people come
and start to talk to you. They ask
questions, and they show that they
are réally interested. It’s great!”
Meanwhile, visitors could
snag a foreign treat to nibble on
tour. There were French crepes,
German cakes, Japanese tea, Ma-
laysian deserts, Indian papard and
candies among a plethora of other
cuisine; “It is a great way to intro-

duce Americans to Indian culture
and cuisine,” said a freshman from
Maharastra, India, Chris Martin.
“It was nice that Americans en-
joyed learning about foreign cul-

\ tures.”

Often one was greeted by
someone in traditional dress. Visi-
tors could have their hands deco-
rated with mendhi, a henna mix-
ture used in India. Others were
taught games or had their names
written in foreign languages. The
final stop was the 900 Room where
dynamic performances and vibrant
music energized audience mem-
bers.

“One of the highlights was the
Ghana dancer, who swept the en-
tire audience with powerful emo-
tion. He was just incredible,” ex-
claimed sophomore Erika Rissing.

Students sang love songs in Ko-
rean and top chart pop songs from
Japan. Aparna Iyer performed a
dance in Bharatnatym style with

grace.
The participants were also

excited about sharing their cul-
tures with those who were curious
enough to ask them about their
countries. “I feel very interna-
tional,” said a prominent junior
from Pakistan, “wearing these
clothes, seeing this stuff which
comes out only once a year and
eating all this food which also
comes out only once a year.” Saad
Gul was proud to be representing
Pakistan at the festival.

“Besides the fact that it’s the
largest one ever,” explained Ruth
Pittard, “the best thing is the feel-
.ing. And this year they really did
it together, cooperatively. Every-
one worked together — the Union,
ISA, Cultural Events, professors,
host families. There’s a sense of
family. It was just so fun!”

4 single serving steaks
1/2 cup vegetable oil

3 Thisp. lemon juice

2 Tblsp. Dijon mustard

if you desire.

again!

If you are a steak and potatoes kind of person, then we have a
recipe for you! To prepare this meal, you will need the following

1/4 cup red wine vinegar

2 Ibs. All purpose potatoes

8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese

2 Tbisp. butter or margarine

1 medium chopped onion

3-4 slices of chopped bacon (optional)

The total cost for this meal will be about thirty dollars. Al-
though the initial price may be high, you will be left with enough
ingredients to prepare this savory marinade several times through-

To begin, combine all ingredients of the marinade recipe in a
serving dish and mix thoroughly. Poke holes in both sides of the
steaKS to allow the marinade to soak in. Place steaks in serving dish
with the marinade and allow three to five hours for steaks to soak in

the marinade. Cover serving dish with aluminum foil and place in
the refrigerator. For best results, flip SteaKs vet during the

three to five hour period. Cook steaks on preheated grill to desired

To prepare cheesy potatoes, begin by cleaning the potatoes
under running water. Next, slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch thick
discs. There is no need to peel the potatoes first, but you may do so

Boil the sliced potatoes for 15-20 minutes. When they are done
cooking, drain excess water. Place potatoes in a baking dish. Add
butter, cheese, onion, and ‘bacon (if desired). Mix ingredients
thoroughly. Place dish in oven set at 325°F and bake for 30 minutes.

Depending on the size of the steak you select, your grilling time
will vary. You will want to time it so that your potatoes will be
coming out of the oven at about the same time that your steaks are
coming off the grill. On average, a 3/4 inch thick steak will take 10-
15 minutes to cook. We hope that you enjoy this feast and please do
not hesitate to call us with any questions orcomments. .. ‘til we cook

body could deliver such a blow, I
was unwilling to find out.

The only other band member
that struck fear into my heart was
Jimmy, aman who seemed more at
home on a Harley than a dark cor-
ner of the cafeteria. He also had a
mustache that travelled from one
side of his chin to the other. But
Jimmy played a small mandolin
which did a lot to lessen the blow
of his appearance when he had to
hunch over in order to finger the
instrument’s tiny fretboard.

The rest of the ensemble
looked fairly normal in their jeans,
cowboy boots, and shirts.
front line was made up of a violin-
ist — although I suppose techni-
cally he played the fiddle. Next to
him stood the lead vocalist who
also played acoustic guitar. It was
this man who did most of the talk-
ing, joking with the crowd and
generally having a good time,
though he seemed to be as con-

The.

fused as the rest of us as to why the
band was playing at the Commons
in the first place. Jimmy and Earl
completed the first wave. Behind
them, hidden in the shadows, was
the bassist playing an upright.

Countléss requests were called
out, but the only one.I recognized

was “Sweet Home Alabama”
which the band refused to play on
the grounds that they hadn’t in-
gested nearly enough alcohol. I
was privileged enough to hear the
band’s version of “Dueling Ban-.
jos” which was lead by Earl and
the guitarist. Many of the other
songs had three or four part harmo- »
nies and double-time solos from
guitar, violin, banjo, and mandolin
(the guitarist calling out “Are you
finished?” to insure he wasn’t cut-
ting Jimmy off) which were all
well performed.

The atmosphere surrounding
the band was one of amusement
and fun which easily crossed over
to the audience. The comic scene
provided a nice change.

Nevertheless, I’m going to
have nightmares about Earl. He
never did talk much....
