JUGGLING gives students a tension release.

(Hunter Jennings)

spirit infects jugglers

[Continued from
Brown, however, aiicres that the
most intectious stage lasts only the

first couple of days and afterwards
people are more willing to save
practive for free time.

' Most jugglers agree that it is a
good tension-reliever, a good thing to
relax with in times of stress. But
there are other reasons for juggling.
For Peeples, ‘‘juggling is just one of
the varied ways of drawing attention
to myself.’’ Brown, who noticed in

that juggling is within reach,
explained, ‘‘What I especially like
about juggling is watching that
moment of discovery... Juggling is a
great springtime thing.”

Plans for an advanced juggling
class for spring term are crystallizing.
George Draughon, a Davidson ('72)

alumnus, has agreed to instruct the
class. Draughon studied mime in
France on a Watson fellowship and
attended the Ringling Brothers Clown
College. He has also worked at Circus
World and now lives in Charlotte.

Another opportunity for jugglers
will be the arrival of the Locomotion
Circus on March 25. This outfit
featuring Bounce the Clown and
Cyrus will offer a 10 a.m. performance
in front of Chambers and an evening
performance in the 900 room.

The spirit of juggling is evident in
the spirit of the juggling class at
Davidson. A special fellowship exists
among jugglers. As Brown expressed

it, ‘People in the class take it as their

challenge to teach another person to
juggle. That challenge is built into the
spirit of the class.”’

Gynecology termed

too specialized care

{Continued from page 8]

One main reason for not
providing adequate gynecolo-
gical care for women is that
gynecology-is considered a
specialized branch of medicine
and the whole philosophy of
the college and the Infirmary
is against specialized medi-
cine. But is gynecological care
for women actually a specialty
that is comparable to others
such as dermatology and oph-
thamology?

Van pointed out that a
frequent argument against
providing that kind of service
to women is that ‘‘if they
provide that they will have to
provide a similar counterpart
for males—but thére isn’t
one.”

Providing adequate birth
control counseling and gyne-
cological care is not catering to
women, it is simply attending
to the different health care
needs of one third of the
students at Davidson.

specialize in at age sixteen,
and continue on with that
specialty when they enter a

-university. Exams come at the

end of four years and encom-

‘pass the entire four year

period. The liberal arts con-
cept as Americans see it is

‘non-existent in Britain; stu-

dents specializing in history,
for example, take only history
courses. Patrick emphasized
that there was hardly any

ious classes at British univer-
sities, and that the upper-
classmen were rather ‘‘snoo-
ty’. Sidney was surprised at
the number of professors that
lectured at Davidson. ‘‘In
England, one sees more of the
class discussion format.’

All were amused at. the
not-so-subtle differences in
speech. “Listening to Ameri-
cans, especially those from the
South, is like listening to an
entirely foreign language,’’
said Lucy. Patrick laughingly
pointed out that the meanings
of slang terms vary drastical-
ly. “I was at a party the other
night, and the girl I was
dancing with remarked, ‘You
shag brilliantly!’’’ With an
obvious gleam in his eye,
Patrick remarked, ‘‘I dared
not tell her what the word
‘shag’ meant in England!”’
