smoke, reduce the amount, and you’ ve already improved things far
more than you would by changing to a “healthier’’ brand.

One final thought: if you’re planning on having kids, don’t
smoke. You’ll have to turn around within the next 15 years and drop

a load of money to pay for your children’s doctor bills. Kids of

smokers (especially small children) come down with a whole buffet
of diseases and ailments resulting from hanging around self-indul-
gent parents. Women especially should not get into the habit. I’m
not even going to touch what smoking does to a forming child.
And then there’s the cost factor. If you smoke, you will spend
somewhere in the neighborhood of $4,500 in the time here at
Davidson if you smoke a pack and a half a day. If you reduce that
intake to a pack a day you’re only dropping $2,912. (Pocket change
for most of us!) On top of that, there’s all those cigarettes Joe
 CChewning is always bumming off everybody. I mean, somebody’ s
gotta pay for them. It gives a whole new meaning to Joe’s Lungs,
doesn’t it?!

We can share our drepmt.

Tam glad to be with
You.
