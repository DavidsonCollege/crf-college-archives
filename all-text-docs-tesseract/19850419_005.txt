Night MotherExplores Mother/Daughter Relations

By LIZ RELYEA

Night Mother, by Marsha
Norman, is a fascinating character
study of two women. Thelma
Cates, played by senior Alva
Moore, is in her late fifties. She is
a strong character who holds that
things are what she says they are.
Her daughter Jessie is played by
sophomore Meitra Khazaeli. Jes-
sie is in her late thirties. She suf-
fers from epilepsy but, in the past
year, with the aid of phenobar-
bitol, she has been free from sei-
zures. She has gained control of
her mind and body, and she is de-
termined to hold on to that con-
trol. To maintain this control, Jes-
sie has decided to commit suicide.
This act will be the one thing she
has done for herself independent
of all others.

The action of the play centers
around Jessie's suicide wish.
Mother and daughter discuss Jes-
sie’s impending suicide as if Jes-
sie were going ona trip. Jessie has
provided for her mother. She has
ordered groceries and made prep-
arations so that Thelma will be
able to care for herself. During
periods of more frequent seizures,
Jessie was forced to make lists so
that she could remember what she
needed to do and where things
dround the house were kept. She
has made these same lists for her
mother.

Jessie’s desperation — stems
from the inability she has to con-

trol her own life. Thelma’s an-
guish is centered around Jessie’s
epilepsy. Thelma denies all re-
sponsiblity for her daughter’s con-
dition, blaming it on Jessie’s
father. Thelma feels guilty about
her daughter’s epilepsy, so she
Overprotects Jessie. Everything
has always been provided for Jes-
sie. Thelma even introduced Jes-
sie to her ex-husband. During her
final moments with her mother,
Jessie discovers that her life has
been much more controlled than
she realized. Thelma had masked
Jessie’s childhood seizures under
the guise of clumsiness. Jessie's
husband Cecil was the first to get
Jessie’s seizures diagnosed by a

doctor. After a horseback-riding
accident, Jessie’s seizures became
more severe. Thelma _ blames
Cecil for this accident as well as
the dissolution of her daughter's
marriage, but Jessie sees it as
another example of her inability to
control her life. “It was his
[Cecil's] idea that I could do any-
thing if I just made up my mind to.
I fell off the horse because I didn’t
know how to hold on. Cecil left
for pretty much the same reason.”

Night Mother is being directed
by senior English major Jenny
Cooper. Cooper has directed two
other plays at Davidson. The first
was the workshop — one-act,
Thymus Vulgaris. The second was

this year’s children’s play, Henry
Mouse. Cooper says she chose to
do Night, Mother because, “I'm,
for obvious reasons, interested in
plays centered around women.”
Cooper hopes to go into directing
professionally.

The play is currently in the
process of being blocked. Block-
ing is generally a slow and painful
process for both actors and direc-
tor. The stage has yet to be built,
and there are no props to work
with. The director must be able to
conceptualize the finished prod-
uct. Cooper encourages input
from her two actors. When al-
lowed to move in accordance to
their lines, actors are much more

natural in their performance.

More and Khazaeli have
worked together previously in this
year’s one-act play Tell Me
Another Story, Sing Me Another
Song. In Night Mother, their
mother-daughter roles are re-
versed. The three women work to-
gether exceptionally well. Moore
and Khazaeli reveal the frustration
and anguish of their characters, as
well as the love they share for each
other,

Night Mother is a very intense
play. The emotional level is quite
strong, but the actors carry it off
successfully. It will be presented
in the 900 Room on Wednesday,
May 8, and Thursday, May 9.

Existential Pathos In The Punch-Drunk Clerisy

Introducing . . .

Few encounters raise one’s
complexion to full blush as intro-
ductions do. Perhaps that’s why |
forgot last week to introduce my-
self and “Punch-Drunk.” While
one-time, mild-mannered More
or Less columnist Ann Meador is
in France visiting art shrines and
otherwise having a “great spring
term,” | am The Davidsonian’s
new weekly, if that often, colum-
nist.

By DAVID McGEE

Being the co-editor emeritus
of The Davidsonian that | am, |
want so much, for a change, to
write about those things I care
deeply about. You probably —
no, make that might — recognize
my name from the by-lines on all
those front-page stories whose
relevance somehow didn’t quite
take your eyes beyond the first
two paragraphs.

My forgiveness flows out just

as the column inches on R.A.C.E.
meetings and reports, editorials,
news analyses, the new and im-
proved president, athletics, Sigma
Phi Epsilon’s return to Patterson
Court, and substance abuse on
campus did for a year and a half
from my pen. So let's get to the
important stuff!

But why “Punch-Drunk?”
One need go no further than A
Browser's Dictionary, by John
Ciardi, (New York: Harper &
Row, Publishers, 1980, p. 318).
Ciardi's definition of punch-
drunk reads: “Dazed, incoherent,
clumsy. [Commonly said of prize
fighters who have lost too many
fights, the condition being usually
attributed to repeated heavy blows
to the head with resultant damage
to small blood vessels and causing
small cerebral clots and impaired
flow of oxygen to the brain.

“Hemingway, however, in
Death in the Afternoon, insists
that the condition is due to
syphilis: “Boxers, bull fighters,
and soldiers contract syphilis for
the reasons that make them choose
their professions.

‘In boxing most sudden re-
versals of form, the majority of
cases of “walking heels,” are
products of syphilis. You cannot
name the individuals in a book be-
cause it is libelous, but anyone of
the profession will tell you of a
dozen recent cases." ]"

As you can see, “Punch-

Drunk” can mean many things.
Sadly, however, not among any
construed definitions of “Punch-
Drunk” should fall my sex life
All credit, though, is due to Ross
Holt, another co-editor emeritus,
who found “Punch-Drunk” in A
Browser’ s Dictionary just before
deadline last week.

As for myself, the name calls
up visions of a typical Patterson
Court party where a luscious drink
known as “grain punch” 1s
served.

Down a couple of glasses of
that stuff, and you won't need
matches to light your cigarettes.
Usually some innocent soul
empties another pint of Everclear
in the vat every half hour or so —
without compensating the brew
with an equal amount of Kool
Aid. The result, depending on
what you had for dinner, is, that’s
right, “Punch-Drunk.” Well,
that’s the introduction (Wheww!)
— nice meeting you.

For several minutes at Tom
Wolfe's lecture a week ago Tues-
day, all of Davidson tacitly as-
sumed everyone in the room un-
questionably belonged to what
Wolfe called the “clerisy.” soct-
ety’s well-educated, intelligent
elite. He told us what the clerisy
was — and that he did well! But
he didn’t bother mentioning who.
specifically those here at David-
son, can rightly claim that they

stand in the same station with this
country’s clerisy

Tom, Tom, Tom! You let us
down! We wanted names!

Now Wolfe couldn't very well
have started pointing out who 1s,
and more importantly who fsa'7,
a card-carrying member of the
clerisy, could he? But that’s the
beauty of it! How baffling! Ev-
eryone at the speech had his or her
academic back against the wall.

If you concluded, “Ot course
I'm in the clerisy, | have a Ph.D.
(don’t bother asking in WHAT!)
— that still counts for something
these days, 'ya know.” then
Wolfe's speech was “one of the
most profound lectures I’ve ever
heard at Davidson.”

Or instead, if you fessed up
and admitted that the clerisy,
when you applied, just laughed
and sent back your resumé, well,
Wolfe's talk was “a bad
humanities lecture.’ Once every-
one had things straight with them-
selves, they began looking around
Love Auditorium.

“Oh, the artsy-fartsy crowd
from Charlotte, who are they kid-
ding, anyway?” And what of that
non-tenure track professor who
rarely appears in anything but ten-
nis shoes and ten-year-old frater-
nity sports wear? Who had the gall
to trash Vice-president for
Academic Affairs and Dean of the
Faculty T.C. Price Zimmer-
mann’s yard with toilet paper and

shaving cream and who thinks
Chamber's lawn ts just another
classroom?

Is he Gor she) clerisy ? Ot
course not!

Others were more desperate
to prove that they belong, When
Wolfe met with about 20 of
Davidson's best and brightest at
the Center Wednesday. there were
so many names dropped that [im
surprised no one stepped on any
on their way out the door.

A typical question asked ot
Wolfe went as follows: “Do you
think the existential pathos you
touched on in The Painted Word
(right around p. 63 paragraph
three) compares to, say. an curly
John Irving, or an aged and empty
William Faulkner?”

Well, what was really being
asked was: “Tin in the clerisy
aren'tl?”

Yet. there are some here at
Davidson who just got their ticket
into the clerisy, but they had to
pay $58 to do it (and keep a 3.6
or better G.P.A. while in school
here). The 43 brand new Phi Beta
Kappa members certainly can
nightly stand inthe winners’ circle
of that lustrous clerisy. can't
they”

Well, can they? “Vm in the
clerisy, aren’ tl?” And how about
all those economics mayors who
read maybe one good novel a
year? Are they clerisy? Whe
knows tf anybody 1s!
