Workshop focuses on prejudices

By Jay Jennings

Last Friday, the National Coa-
lition Building Institute helda one-
day prejudice reduction workshop
to teach students, staff, and faculty
new methods to counter discrimi-
nation, to become more sensitive
to prejudice problems, and how to
run future workshops.

The workshop, held in the
Chambers Multi-Purpose Room,
lasted seven hours. Thirty stu-
dents, staff, and faculty signed up
for the workshop in all; students
composed half of the group.

The NCBI is a national orga-
nization based in Washington that
has given the same workshop on
campuses all over the country.
Alumna Bonnie Wright ran the
workshop along with Collin Rustin,
Jr. They both work out of the
NCBI Raleigh branch.

Richard Terry hopes that this
workshop will lead toa “core group

Chambers invites
nocturnal students
to the quiet
asylum of its

upper floors

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Many students often have a
hard time finding a quiet place to
study. . Some-seek a quiet room

within the halls of the Chambers” “ff

building but are disappointed when
they find that many classrooms are
inaccessible.

This problem has recently
been rectified; now many more
classrooms will be open to stu-
dents at all hours of the day.

Junior class president B.J.
Rudell and Freshman SGA repre-
sentative Josh Gaffga went to reg-
istrar Polly Griffin to investigate
the problem. She originally agreed
to open up three more rooms, but
then decided to open all but nine
classrooms. Rooms 212, 228, 301,
304, 309, 312, 325, 337, and
Perkins Auditorium will not be
open for studying. All other rooms
will be open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.

“It seemed that having only
six rooms open was unfair,” says
Rudell. “This is a big step.”

Rudell says the rooms were

previously closed due to students
leaving them in disorder. There
was also some worry about safety
within Chambers with so many
people going in and out in the
middle of the night.

Freshman Michelle

McDonald studies in Chambers,
and has found the new policy ben-
eficial.

“It’s hard to find aroom some-
times because you want tobe alone.
This should improve things a lot,”
she said.

Tolbert reflects on feminism & Christianity

Bible continued from page 2

Tolbert insinuates that these “au-
thorities” intended to do other than
reveal the word of God.

Tolbert also undermines the
modern “personal power of the
pastor” whose congregation be-
lieves he has the ability “toread the
Bible’s magic correctly.” Accord-
ing to Tolbert, such power enables
the Church to dictate and delegate
judgement within the community.

Pastor James Howell of
Davidson United - Methodist

Church expressed his belief that’

such pastoral power can deliver
useful and comforting effects to
people in need of the uncondi-

tional love and acceptance found
in Christianity. Tolbert replied
that part of mature Christianity is
recognizing that the pastor is not
God. In her experience, pastoral
power has led to abuses of author-
ity over the oppressed and minori-
ties (e.g., the pastoral advice,
"wives submit to your husbands”).

Tolbert clearly and readily
admitted that she has her own po-
litical and social agenda for which
she seeks justification in the Bible:
the liberation of the oppressed. This
agenda was evident in all of her
interpretations and arguments
against the status quo Church au-
thority. Tolbert constantly ques-
tions, “Quibono?” (for whose good

is it?).

Until recently the answer has
always been “for the betterment of
the politically and socially power-
ful.” This answer falls short of
satisfying Tolbert’s quest for true
Biblical authority. She refuses to
put her understanding of the Word
of God in the hands of priestly
politics and challenges us to do the
same.

Mrs. Tolbert is the author of
Perspectives on the Parables, Sow- .
ing the Gospel: Mark’s World in
Literary and Historical Perspec-
tive and the editor of The Bible and
Feminist Hermeneutics.

campus problems when they arise.”

The Harmony Committee paid
for the workshop with money
granted to the school by the Philip
Morris Company designated for
promoting diversity.

The Harmony Committee was
created two years ago after several
incidences of racist acts occurred
on campus. After some campus
leaders began meeting to talk about
the problems, the committee offi-
cially formed.

Assistant Dean of Students
John Eaves, in charge of the Morris
grant along with the Harmony
Committee, thought the workshop
was an excellent way to use some
of the money.

Reaction to the workshop was
positive. Although the workshop
was lengthy, junior John Ford said,
“Tt did not feel like seven hours,”

and the experience gave him new
ways to think about prejudice.
Professor Don Kimmel said the
workshop allowed the participants
to “investigate characteristics of
their individual groups and find
out of which things they should be
proud of and not proud of.”

The Harmony Committee did
not expect miracles with the work-
shop but hoped that the people
attending would have a greater
understanding of how to deal with
prejudice.

The turnout was a bit smaller
than the committee had hoped; the
lower numbers were attributed to
the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment game on the same night.

Before the workshop, Terry
said that if it was successful, they
would try to have the workshop in
an extended form next fall.
