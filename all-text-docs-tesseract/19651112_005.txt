THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE FIVE

NOTHING GLAMOROUS

Cross country is not a glamorous sport by the
farthest’stretch of the imagination.

Thousands of fans will holler themselves hoarse
as 22 well-padded young gentlemen try to
each other into the turf ofa football field.

Hundreds of fans will turn out to shout insults
at lousy referees as 22 bruised-shinned soccermen
try to break each other’s legs.

Evenitens of fans will turn out to heap ridicule,
scorn, and enmity upon a rival fraternity’s flicker-
ball team

But the only fellow t# watch a cross country
meet is fhe coach, or someone who accidentally is
watching something else when some scantily-clad
“harrier”, as these cross countriers are called, comes
running by'in his black boxer drawers.

“Cress country is not a very popular sport, you
know,” track coach Heath Whittle confessed as he
sat on a bench in the cross country dressing room
late Wednesday evening. “All you can see is the start
and the finish.”

But between the start and finish, the part you
never see, the race is run — and won.

Between ihe start and fimish, four miles of
misery spread aut a tightly packed mass of a dozen
or more runners into a long line ef ones and twos.

What happens between the gun and the tape is
impossible to write. Each runner faces a thousand
challenges that eventually break the mass down to
individuals — How fast to start? To take the man in
front of you now, or later when he’s tired? To run
fast up a hill, or fast down a hill? Whether to throw
an elbow back or to run faster? When to slow down
‘on a turn? How best to run in mud? How best to get
over gravel? or sand? or pavement?

Few “sports” fans really appreciate sport —
pure sport — and if nothing else cross country is
pure sport. For there are no cheers and laurels for
the victor, only a throbbing side, an aching chest,
burning eyes filled with sweat, and limp legs that
feel stretched, twisted, and pulled all the wrong
way at the same time. Only a runner can appreciate
fully the pain it takes to run. Even a winner must
realize he will never be fully repaid in glory for the

pains he bled in solitude.

But a loser; then you have absolutely no glory
to show for the work and no one really remotely
cares how much you sweated or bled or hurt... .

CROSS COUNTRY CAPTAIN

Little Paces Weak Harriers

By K. D. WEEKS
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Andy Li ttle, Davidson
cross country team’s senior
standout, has consistently
set the pace for not only his
team but usually the entire
conference field as well.

Of seven meets this season,
Little has finished ahead of the
pack in two of them, and one of
those victories came in a tri-
meet involving ECC, VMI and
Davidson. He finished second in
two more meets, losing the num
ber one spot by only two sec
onds.

Campbell Upsets Booters;
Emory, SC Tourney Ahead

By JOEL KEYS
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Coach Harry Fogleman’s soccer team suffered a painful defeat at the hands of |
Campbell College, 3-2, here Friday.
With the score tied, 1-1 at the end of regulation time, the two teams went into
two overtimes before Campbell squeaked by, 3-2.

Tomorrow the Wildcats jour-
ney to Atlanta where they. will
play Emory in the final contest
of the regular scheduled season.
Fogleman is hoping for'a David

son victory in that contest. The.

basis for his optimism is the fact
that Davidson defeated Belmont
Abbey, who conquered Emory.
Neither Campbell nor Emory
fields a football team, so their
entire toe talent is devoted to
soccer.

Fogleman is awaiting the up
coming Southern Conference
Tournament which will be held
here November 18-20. Five
teams, Davidson, Furman, Wil-
liam and Mary, George Wash-
ington and West Virginia, will
compete in round-robin play. for
the conference championship.

Each team will play two 22-
minute periods against each of
the other teams. In case of a tie
a 15 minute overtime will be
held. If the teams are still tied
at the end of the overtime, sud-
den-death play will begin in
which the first team to get a
corner kick is declared the vic-
tor.

The team with the most vic-
tories will be the Southern Con-
ference champion. In case of a
tie the championship will be
shared.

ning the two mile course and
even sometimes at night jogging
around the stadium track again
and again. One freshman claims
that he and his date saw Little
running around the football field
after midnight one Saturday
night.

Another example of his eager-
ness to work and improve is in
a statement that Little made
after being asked about his long-
est workout. ‘Last Saturday
after the game, I ran a good
way up the road toward Concord
then back down the road almost
into Cornelius, just for enjoy
ment. Other times I don't enjoy
working out so much, but this
time I did."’ This lengthy jog
was “just to loosen up’’ as he

put it.

The greatest effort and finest
accomplishment Little has made
this year came in the VMI, ECC,
Davidson tri-meet when he fin-
ished in near Davidson record-
time for the course, missing the
mark held by former runner
Sterling Martin by only five sec-
onds.

Commenting on the race itself
Little said ‘“‘Four miles is a long
way, and like anyone would, I
get ‘tard’. I run about two miles
and think ‘I’ve only been half
way’, then when I have only one
half mile to go and find I have
plenty left I wish I had poured
it on in the middle of the race."

The season comes to a close

day for Morgantown,

West

Virginia, where the

Southern Conference cross country meet is to be

held Monday.
“William and Mary

is favored to finish first,

Furman should finish second, and West Virginia
third,” said Coach Heath Whittle. “I expect Andy
Little to do well in this meet.”

Last Monday the North Carolina state cross

country meet was held. The varsity placed sixth out
of nine teams in the meet. Duke was first, UNC
second, and Wake Forest third. Little placed eighth
and won a medal over the four mile curse. The Fresh-
men came in seventh out of a nine team field. Randel
Phillips finished fourteenth in the race. UNC placed
first, Duke was second, and Wake Forest third.

Concerning the state meet, Coach Whittle com-
mented, “We ran about as well as we have all season
— I was well pleased with them.” Whittle also com-
mented on next season. “The freshman season is over
and next year we should have a much better team
— deeper and much stronger with the up-coming
Freshmen and Sophomores.”

“I'm really pointing toward that
race; but the course will be two
tenths of a mile longer and a

lot flatter than I like’’ he says.

Of Little’s success, Coach
Whittle remarked “‘We are well
pleased with Andy's running this
year, and we are expecting him
to do well in the Conference
meet,"’ Whittle, on the Southern
Conference Board, went on to
say that Little has a good
chance to make the eight man
All-Conference team if he does
well in the meet Monday.
