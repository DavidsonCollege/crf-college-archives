THIS WENT OVER WELL IN L.A!

Greg Dunn exhibits his amazing sense of balance dur-
ing the East Carolina game. None of the Pirates could do

this trick

A new program of electives
to satisfy the Physical Educa-
tion requirements was revealed
by Athletic Director Thom Cart-
mill on Saturday, Feb. 5.

“T believe that these options
allow a greated@iegree of
flexibility. commisserate with
the maturity of today’s David-
son student,’’ Cartmill stated.

“These options fit in perfectly
with all phases of the average
student’s lifestyle. We don’t
want ‘to interfere with their
serious pursuits,’’ he added.

The new program consists of
five separate individual and two
team sports. These include:

The Charles Atlas Body
Building Course. This is
designed to be done in the
student’s spare moments. The
charge of $9.98 plus shipping
and handling is added. to the
student’s Activities Fee.

Sword Swallowing. This is
designed for both sexes but
SGA President John Munce ex-
pressed hope that attendance
would consist primarily of
women students. ‘‘We feel that
this course is one that the girls
can gain practical experience
from and apply in their free
time.’’ The course is team-
taught by Dean of Women
Diane Stone and Economics
Professor C. Louise Nelson.

Neck and Skull Conditioning.
Students practice »anging their
heads against the wall to
toughen the muscles in the in-
terior -of the skull cavity. “We
give any student a personally-
determined number of times to
bang his head per day. The
number is arrived at by taking

the inverse of his G.P.A. and
multiplying that: by the number
of terms he has left at David-
son,’’ Munce explained.

Waterbed pushups. This is a
rigorous system of pushups
designed to be performed on a
waterbed. This course accepts
only partners. Usually one
team-mate is on top, with the
one underneath pushing off to
maintain a steady rythymn. “‘I
am especially fond of this cour-
se. It encourages the healthy in-
terplay of people that Davidson
has. always sought to foster,’
Dean of Students Will Terry
commented.

Simplified isometrics. In this
course students are taught a
convenient system of isometric
exercises utilizing the natural
tensions that run through many
“This is a
super-handy course. I love it
because the kids can knock off
studying for a few seconds and
do these things with the chair
right there in their carrel. All
work and no play makes for a
dull Wildcat,”’ Vice President in
charge of Academic Affairs
Jack Bevan enthused.

In addition to the above ‘‘in-
dividual’’ sports, two ‘‘team’’
sports have been added to the
P.E. roster. These are:

Cats Trundle Past VMI, 94-93

Dunn, Verlin Spark Yawner

The Wildcats, generally
regarded as inept on the road,
summoned up from somewhere
deep within their tortured
psyches those twin virtues of
hustling and fast, good playing
to overly toy with the Virginia
‘Military Institutes’ immature
Keydets and finally arrived at a
drawn-out 94-93 victory.

The Cats took their own sweet
time, as they threw the game in-
to double overtime before
dashing the over-eager tin
soldiers. In fact, during the
second half, if looked as if
Davidson Coach Bo Brickels
had once again spotted the op-
ponent 10-15 points.

VMI lead by six at the half, 41-
35, and seemed to be on the way
to taking their turn at making
the Cats run themselves into the
hard dirty court. With 13
minutes left the improbable
Keydets had chiseled a 14-point-
lead onto the scoreboard and
eight minutes later, with less
than six minutes to go, they de-
luded themselves with an 11-
point advantage.

Ah, but in vain did the boy

‘soldiers fight, as the deter-

mined, fired-up, battling Wild-
cats placed themselves back in-
to contention behind. the
sublime striving of junior Tom-

mie Verlin’s joust-high 29
points. Well done, lad.

What happened is that, like
VMI had a free throw and
missed it, so like Greg Dunn
(he’s C.A., you know) got
fouled on the rebound an’ he
made like both shots. There was
only two seconds left, so man

Planned

Squaring the Circle. Small
groups of students gather on an
informal basis to put their
heads together, do. deep-
breathing and breath control
excercises and contemplate the
Chain of Being. ‘‘This is another
fine excercise that embodies
the actualized principles upon
which Davidson is founded.
Students can come together and
benefit in mind and body in a
meaningful way,” said Terry.

Weekend Gymnastics. This
sport frequently includes coed
students who are _ interested
enough in, or blindly led to, the
strange physical games played
by Davidson men. The stagnant
supply of Davidson females
who indulge in these usually
nocturnal romps, and the scores
can become the topic on many
lips about campus. ‘In the past
this has always been the most
popular game on campus, and I
am glad to see students get of-
ficial credit for it now. It sup-
ports the highest ideals of
Davidson and the trustees: the
sense of a community, people
living and playing together in
harmony, loving familiarity
and mutual understanding,”
Terry stated.

The new courses begin in the
spring.

the Cats got overtime.

Then like, man VMI had to
put it into the second overtime,
and the Cats nearly got really
messed up. ‘Cause like even
with less than a minute left VMI
had a 3-point lead and man like
it looked all over.

But big Sheldon Parker, who
frankly folks has _ been
something of an enigma this
year, and that’s putting it
mildly, came through with his
only basket of the game to put
the Cats within one, and Dunn
hit a layup with 23 seconds left.
Dunn was the clutch player for
the Cats tonight, making 20
points overall, six in the crucial
second overtime.

Brickels regarded the game
to be something of a rush. “I
said to them boys af halftime, I
said, ‘You gotta shape up bet-
ter, boys,’ I said. I gave them a
real good talking-to, and it

really musta perked them up a.

little, I mean, lookit what they
did they. went and won the damn
thing. I never knew I had it in
me. I’m so happy, really Iam,”
he stated.

The Keydets repeatedly in-

jured themselves with fouls this"

evening, and this cost them the
game when they made an of-
fensive foul with four seconds
remaining.

The military pawns doubtless

have little love for the Cats, who
held up their attempt at a 12th
victory, for the first time since
1964, which coincidently is the
last time they made a Davidson
basketball team taste defeat.
The loss drops VMI to 11-9
overall and 6-4 for the season.

Conversely, the win helped
Davidson’s record, raising it to
surprising 6-15 against all foes,
and 3-5 in the conference, which.
is the Southern Conference,
which has a tournament that
the Cats still have a_ slight
chance in hell of playing at
home in.
