Davidson strikes huge TV deal with future Final Fours in mind

Men's soccer —

gets set for
UNCC match
Thursday

By Will Cobb

After a couple of tough losses.

to top twenty teams, the Davidson
soccer team begins preparation for
county rival UNCC. The Wildcat’s
record now stands at 1-2 on the
season after losing to the four-
teenth ranked South Carolina
Gamecocks 5-0 last Wednesday.

The Cats got their first win of the’ _

season by defeating Syracuse Uni-
versity 4-1 two days earlier.

In the Syracuse victory, Ben
Hayes scored twice, Andy Haile
once and Reed Maltbie recorded
his first. career goal. Davidson
played their first three games in
only five days, and have come to-
gether asa team quickly. The eight
day break between their last game
and UNCC on Thursday allows
the coaches and players ample time
to work out their problems. Coach

Slagle, who is pleased with-the_

team’s talent, has concern about a
lack of leadership displayed on the
field. With the loss of many expe-
rienced: players from last year’s
squad, this year the team has en-
countered more unforced errors,
difficulty with defensive move-
ment, anda general lack of control.
This situation will improve game
by game once players become more
comfortable and used to playing
with each other. There is an excel-
lent level of talent on the team so
big wins should be expected as
much as disappointing losses.
The soccer team now looks
forward toits big match with cross-
county rival UNCC this Thursday
at home at 7:00 p.m. This will
make the third top twenty team in
four games. With the return of
Mack Cozier, arguably the fastest
soccer player in the country, the
49er’s have a potent offense.
UNCC is coming off a big win
over Clemson and big upset loss to
Virginia Commonwealth. This
game is traditionally close and in-
tense, and this year should be no
different. UNCC is quick to re-
mind everyone the last time
Davidson officially beat them. But
Davidson knows who played in
the Final Four last year and who
did not, and Davidson knows who
choked last year and who did not.
Come help fill the stands this Thurs-
day to greet our Cats at their first
home game.

larity in America.

Davidson is hosting the 1993
and 1994 NCAA soccer semifinal
and final games, but the television
package created this summer might
give the college a big role in an
increasingly popular event indefi-
nitely.

“The key tomaking the cham-
pionships bigger and better isn’t a
larger site than Richardson Field
liere at Davidson, but a national
television audience,” says Millen.

Alarger television audience inevi-
tably creates more demand for tick-
ets. If Davidson can develop a
large television audience for soc-
cer, the dollars raised forthe NCAA
from ticket sales will be increas-
ingly insignificant compared to the
sale of television rights, and

Volleyball set for fall season

By Peter Amidon

If 1992 was seenas the transi-
tion year with new coach Carolyn
Blake taking over the helm, 1993
should provide the results of this
change of leadership. The first few
weeks of this young season do
indeed demonstrate results. The
team returns five lettermen from a
year ago. Seniors Katherine Ander-
son and Amy Howard will serve as
captains for a squad which reflects
tremendous balance with two se-
niors, two juniors, a sophomore,
and a freshman starting.

Junior Lori Logan returns as
the starting setter. Hampered by a
broken bone in her foot last season,
she returns healthy and experi-
enced. Anderson and Howard hope
to dominate at the net this season
with Howard playing outside hit-
ter on the right side for the first
time in her career.

Junior Carol Bitter enters the
starting line this season and will
play outside hitter. Sophomore
Michele Augustin returns healthy
and explosive after earning South-
ern Conference Freshman of the
Year a season ago. Freshmen Tara
Smith or Jenny Bruner will also

start for the Wildcats. Freshman
Ami Bondurant will back up Logan
at center. ‘

A tough schedule will chal-

lenge the Catsthisseason. Already .

they have competed in the Georgia
Tech Tournament and placed sec-
ond. They lost to eventual, cham-
pion Georgia Tech in the opening
match.

They then went on to defeat
Eastern Carolina, Coastal Caro-
lina, and Winthrop to finish sec-
ond. Head Coach Carolyn Blake
commented: “I was really pleased
with our play. We did exactly what
we needed to do to win, and I think
we played better than the scores
showed against Georgia Tech.”

Davidson will. open a five
game stint at home beginning with
the Tarheels of North Carolina on
September 14 at 7:00 p.m. Co-
Captain Howard reflects on her
hopes for the team by stating, “we
hope to raise our level of play and
become a dominant force in the
Southern Conference.”

The time for transition is over
and now is the time when a healthy
and talented Wildcat team will
prove themselves.

remain onthis campus forever, but
dobelieve itis possible to keep it in
the Charlotte area with Davidson
acting as the permanent host.
“When it outgrows Richardson
field, we could move to Memorial
Stadium in Charlotte, and from
there to the NFL stadium once that
is built,” he explained. “But the
key for us would be to maintain our
involvement as hosts, both for rev-
enueand for the visibility and pres-
tige it would bring to Davidson.”

Millen got involved with the
television deal because the NCAA
was essentially uninterested in
working on it, Millen said, Sens-
ing the possible benefits, Davidson
bought the TV rights for the two
semifinal games from the NCAA
more than six months ago and
started trying to interest sponsors
in the event. “It didn’t take long,
though, for us to realize that live

Football struggles to
7-3 loss at Sewannee

By Robert Lloyd-Still

Davidson knew that their first
three games were going to be ex-
tremely tough. .On Saturday, the
Cats played their hearts out. Un-
fortunately for Davidson they fell
a little short, losing 7-3. On the
first possession of the second half,
Davidson marched 69 yards and
Drew Fasset hit a 28 yard field
goal. Sewanee came back with a
score of their own when Carl Cra-
vens ran the ball in from 36 yards.
Cravens was tough all day. He
rushed the ball 29 times for 150
yards.

Davidson had plenty of op-
portunitiesin this game. Twice they
had the ball deep in Sewannee’s
territory, but were unable to capi-
talize. Davidson threw an inter-
ception from the 16 on one drive
and fell short on a fourth down at
the seven yard line on another.
While the Cats only managed a
field goal on the day, they did
movetheballup the field extremely
wellinthesecondhalf. Davidson’s
quarterback, Richard Howell,
played another fantastic game in
his illustrious career. Howell

passed for 112 yards and ran the
ball for 101.

The defense was the story of
the day for Davidson. They man-
aged to sack Sewanee’s quarter-
back six times. The defensive line,
led by Mills Ariail and Curtis
Burns, put pressure on the quarter-
back all day long. And some credit
is due to the secondary who cov-
ered the receivers so well that some
of those sacks were due to cover-
age.

In the second half, the Cats
played strong offensively. They
controlled the line of scrimmage
and created huge holes for the run-
ners. Seniors Jack Barry and Rob
King created the gaps that helped
Davidson rush the ball 40 times for
191 yards. With the running game
in high gear, wide receivers Ike
Bailey and Kelly Shirley worked
underneath the defense for short
completions. If the Cats can play
an entire game like the second half

‘on Saturday, there should be no

trouble in winning games this year.
Davidson plays their first

home game versus Rhodes Col-

lege at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday.
