Discriminating Davidson men wouldn’t have bothered.

What is perhaps the college
man's only sacred cow — the
slick-paper siren of Playboy's
centerfold—proved to be truly
bovine last week when one of
that exalted number appeared
in the flesh for close-ups in 13
loci where Playboys are digest-
ed monthly and avidly. The
grass is greener on the other
side of the camera. and it would
seem that our specimen had

partaken indiscriminately of
that sumptuous pasture. A
toast, then, to make-up and

photographic genius.

Miss Nancy Jo Hooper, Feb-

Call To Action Set
For Down-Trodden

Tonight at 11 o’clock, the

be the scene of the “first an-
nual all-purpose demonstra-
tion.” According to the or-
ganizers (who understandably
wish to remain anonymous),
@ considerable amount of
philosophical contemplation

event.

The demonstration will
serve for the ventilation of the
pent-up energies, the suppres-
sed desires, the latent detes-
tations of all and any David-
son students.

Central to the whole event
will be a protest against un-
imaginative lectures, reviews,
as well as gnome professors

‘and administrators. Anyone

may make a statement to the
convocation if he so desires
so long as he makes a state-
ment of intent and régistra~
tion. with the steering com-
mittee in 410 Duke.

All demonstrators must

titles for signs: Help Stamp

For those who have no de-

been suggested for later in the
evening. “The possibilities,”
noted an organizer, “are end-

The Smith Rare Book Room
of the Davidson College Library.
a memorial to four brothers].
who attended Davidson, will be
formally opened on May 9.

The room will house many of
the library's old and rare books.
Highlights of the collection, ac-
cording to Dr. Chalmers David-
son, the directory of the library,
are more than 100 European
and American first editions of
Robert Burns’ works and two
“incunabula’* (cradle books).
which were printed before 1500.
One of the incunabula com.
prises the complete works of
Seneca, and the other includes
a biography of Thomas a Bec-
ket.

Other rare works in the li-
brary include a two-volume set
of Dr. Samuel Johnson's fam-
ous dictionary, believed to be
from the first edition of 1755.
Both rare books and rare maga
zines are included in the col-
lection, most of which, Dr. Dav-
idson said, has been donated to
the library over a long period. |

Funds for the renovation of
the second-floor room are be.

in honor of his father. Dr. C.

uncles, Drs. Hay Watson Smith.

treme pleasure, and was hard-
ly able to contain herself on
about eight separate occasions.

Miss Hooper spread ‘herself
as thinly as possible under the
circumstances, stopping at
each fraternity house and
Lingle Manor to pose for
cheesecake snapshots and
conduct five-minute forums.
Some of the discussions at the
houses were rather animated,
notably an interview with the
Sigma Chis. After a subtle in-
vitation — ‘‘Doesn’t anybody
else want to kiss me?” — the
erstwhile beauty bestowed a
tantalizing sample of her
charms on wave after wave
of the brotherhood.

Playboy spoke of her as a
simple home-town Georgia
Peach. Miss Hooper (Nancy

Ann Harrison) hails from Spar-

YMCA President Burns

Announces Cabinet Posis

BY JIMMY WHITE

[

Lanier Burns, recently elected president of the YMCA, has announced his
cabinet for next year. Those appointed head committees with a specific function in

next year’s “Y” program.

The Executive Committee,
elected by the student body, is
composed of Lanier Burns,
president: Eric Nichols. vice-
president: Mac Otts. secretary:
and Barry St. Clair, treasurer.

Rick Brand and Jay Feder-
man will head the forums com-
mittee. Second semester of next
year, Jay Federman will con-
duct a sefies on -philosophical
ethics and Rick Brand will run
a similar series on practical
ethics. This committee is also
in charge of securing speakers
from varied vocations.

The Great Issues Program, a
first semester program under
Fred Sackett, will center on the
individual's responsibility in
concerning himself with elec-
tions. especially the national
elections.

The spiritual life committee is
to be headed by Bill Rule. Next
year, it will be changed to com-
bine with the various fellow-
ships, bringing closer co-ordin-
ation between the two. Rule will
also be in charge of voluntary
chapel and hopes to improve
student-faculty relations with
better informal discussions.

John Crow and Decker Faw
will run the deputations com-
mittee which will be expanded
to include all opportunities such
as churches in this area. The
aim of this committee is to get
Davidson students involved in

working with these churches
and at other colleges as part of
the Student Exchange Program
in which Davidson students go
to other schools for discussions
and students from other schools
will come here.

Steve Ramsburgh is in charge
of the Community Work Pro-
gram which will remain similar
to this year’s program of work-
ing with scout troops, coaching
area athletic teams and other
community service projects.

The Tutorial Service, started
this year, will be continued and
expanded under John Curry and
Duncan Newcomer.

A new committee has been de-
vised for next year. This orien-
tation group committee, under
Vernon Anderson will start dis-
cussion groups and related pro-
jects on the freshman halls next
year to promote freshman hall
unity and more rapid orienta-
tion.

George Nzongola and Jon
Miller are in charge of the In-
ternational Students Program
which is to further orient for-
eign students. It will remain
much as it was this year.

The publicity committee is to
be headed by Charlie Dibbie,
Buck Lawrimore and John
Alexander.

Students who contributed
blood were excused from ROTC

increase in” contributions was
due to many cadets’ nating that
drill would be held regardless
of the weather condition.

The ROTC department spon-

son: this time Capt. Donald M.
Campbell was the co-ordinator
of the program. About 80 vol-
unteers from the Davidson com-
munity contributed their serv-
ices aS nurses, registrars and
hostesses, while the sergeants
from the ROTC department al-
so donated their time and ener-
gies. In addition, some ROTC
students assisted Red Cross
personnel and received extra
merits.

Capt. Campbell termed the
drive this week ‘very success-
ful’” and added that more pints
would have been collected had

WILL SPEAK IN FRIDAY CHAPEL

Ole Miss Professor Plans
Lecture On Race Situation

BY HARRY CARR

James Silver, a controversial University of Missis-
sippi history professor, will be on campus Thursday and
Friday as the second of three speakers in the YMCA’s
forum on the racial situation.

“William Faulkner’ will be
Silver's topic on Thursday eve-
ning in Hodson Hall. In con-
nection with the racial theme,
he will deliver the address
“Mississippi Rises’’ in chapel
Friday morning. Because of
Silver's appearance, there will
be no chapel on Thursday.

As Silver stepped down from
the presidency of the Southern
Historical Association last No-
vember, he presented a highly
controversial attack on his
home state. Although he admit-
ted that Negroes have made
some gains in Mississippi, he
called the state ‘‘a closed so-
ciety."*

In his 27 years as a professor
at Ole Miss, Silver has appear-
ed numerous times before the
Board of Trustees to defend
himself against charges by the
White Citizens Council. The
charges ranged from practicing
Communism to desecrating the
memory of a Confederate gen-
eral.

Later this month, NAACP
lawyer Herbert Hill will com-
plete the Y’s three-part pro-
gram on desegregation.

Former Professor

of Theology at Louisville Semin-
ary, will speak at vespers Sun-

to his alma mater as a profes-
sor of theology in 1946. Winn
holds a BD and a ThD from
Union Seminary in Richmond.

There will be one other guest
speaker this year. Dr. Albert
Wells, pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church in Laurinburg

final vespers service of the year
