Buddie—“Good morning, Jim, how are
you feeling?”
Jim—‘Oh, pretty well. I have felt bet-
ter, but it has cost me more.”

“Don’t Know.”
_Junker—“Ts that fire burning?”
Wilkinson—“No, but the coal is.”

“Fit One.”
There was a young tea hound named
Doubles,
With his girls he always had troubles,
They say that one day
His girl sent him away,
For she found he was just blowing bub-
bles.

Fit Two.
John:Simpson, a guy from the alley,
Once forth. with his coal box did sally,

But he left his big trunk
With all of his junk
And didn’t even wait for “Talley.”

Prohibition.
Bob McCuen finds a certain class so
dry he has to have liquid refreshments
sent up to him during the class.

“Listen.”

The speaker came to the climax of his
speech to a group of South Carolinians,
among whom was one Texan, our friend
Tucker. The speaker proposed the
question, “How many people in the house
are South Carolinians?” , Everybody
arose except Tucker. The speaker went
to him and said, “My brother, what are
your”

“A Texan,” was the prompt reply.

“And why are you not a South Caro-
linian?” asked the speaker.

“Because my father, grandfather and
great grandfather were all Texans,” was
the answer.

“Friend, if your fother, grandfather
and great grandfather were idiots, what
would you be?”

“A South Carolinian,” was the quick
reply.

GAMMA SIGMA EPSILON BIDS
SEVERAL ‘CHEMISTRY STARS

On Friday night, February 24th, the
Gamma Sigma Epsilon held a meeting
in its club room. The meeting was call-
ed for a business session. The chairman
on extension reported favorable cor-
respondence with several leading institu-
tions, regarding the installation of chap-
ters in these institutions. A number of
men have been pledged and will later
be initiated. These men are leading
chemistry students of the Junior class
and are H. H. Smith, C. F. Wildman, and
N.’R. Currie.

The local chapter is taking as its pri-
mary study this spring, the Vitimine
question. T. M. Lowry entertained the
club at this meeting with the first paper
on this important biochemical question.

PROSPECTS BRIGHT FOR A
TRACK TEAM
WORTH WHILE

On your marks! Get set! Bang! The
pistol flashes and the Wildcat track sea-
son of ’22 is under way. Almost fifty
aspiring candidates gathered on the ath-
letic field last Friday to listen to Coach
Grey’s first words of instruction. If
the material at hand can be taken as
any indication, the coming season should
find the Wildcats roaring in
after the state championship.

earnest

Six letter men will, in all probability,
be on hand in an effort to hold their
positions against the host of new candi-
dates out. In the dashes Luke Erwin,
the only letter man back from last year,
feels that he can be of more service on
the diamond than on the cinder path,
and while Luke is a speedy man, the va-
cancy will probably be ably filled by the
two Greensboro flashes, Koenig and Hen-
drix, and by Hoye, an arrival fram Mis-
sissippi, and a host of other men as well.

In the distance events McBryde and
Galloway, two of last year’s traveling
blast furnaces, will be on hand to circle
the oval any number of times. Last
year McBryde hung up a new record for
the two-mile, and even more is expected
from him this year. Besides the two
letter men of last year, G. B. Roberts,
Sprunt, Russell, Guiton and others will
be out.

The hurdles are vacant this year, but
with the wealth of material at hand,
some one will be found fitted to race
over the obstacles in winning time.

In the field and weight events the sky
is rosy also. Big Knight, captain of this
year’s team, tosses around the discus
and shot just for the mere pleasure of it
and ought to hang up more than one
first place this year.

The various jump events will be ably
cared for by Gentry and McGukin, from
last year’s squad, and Pritchard and
Gracy, two new men who are sure to
make things hot for them.

Coach Grey intends to carry fifteen
men on all the trips this year, so there is
plenty of inducement for everybody to
work hard. The schedule is one of the
hardest the Red and Black has ever at-
tempted but under the able direction of
Coach Grey the Wildcats should make
the feathers fly when they visit the
roosts of their opponents. The sched-
ule follows:

April 8th—V. P. I. at Blacksburg, Va.

April 15th—N. C. State at Davidson.

April 22d—U. of S. C. at Columbia, S. C.

Early in May—State meet at Trinity.

LIFE-WORK PARAGRAPHICS

(Continued from page 3)

Competition, 1.1 per cent.

Speculation, .7 per cent.

By forethought and intelligent prepara-
tion, it is possible to avoid most of these
pitfalls. Their victims are nearly always
the ignorant, the untrained, the im-
petuous, and the vacillating.

Those who are wise undertake to know
themselves, to analyze the opportunities |
ahead, to recognize the channels from
the rocks and shoals, the occupations
with good futures from the “blind alley”
occupations, and on the basis of this
knowledge they form a clean-cut, de-|
liberate plan of procedure.

Things to Consider About Each
Occupation.

1. Its nature and peculiar require-
ments (including physical, educational
and general.)

2. Your personal qualifications for it
and your special interest in it.

3. Special preparation necessary to
meet requirements and how and where
to obtain it.

4. Conditions characteristic of the oc-
cupation (including location, environ-
ment, kind of employers and employees.)

5. The starting point and opportu-
nities for growth and advancement.

6. Compensation—Beginning, Average,
Top.

7. Tendencies of the times and present
demands.

8. Public service and personal satis-
faction.

Hew to Make the Most of Your Talents,
Experience and G al Equip t.
1. Begin early to do well some useful

work.

2. Choose work that appeals to you
or poh, none has a special appeal, choose
work that nets some income, a good deal
of experience, employs an increasing
amount of ability, and is of genuine value
to others.

3. Acquire confidence in yourself and
the respect of others by doing what you
set out to do.

4. Let your preparation be one of
progressive trials followed by elimina-
tion or concentration (as the case may

Le) until you have a background for in-|*

telligent judgment and choice.

5. Avoid making an carly or hasty
final decision. Take all the helpful ad-
vise you can get and in the end decide |
for yourself. Think Things Through.

Certain qualities such as health, char-|
acter, judgment, mental
capacity, initiative, and the like are im-

personality,

portant factors in achieving conspicious
success in any line,of endeavor. For this |
reason and the further reason that many |
persons sare able to do
passingly well, it is possible to become!
fairly proficient in more than one oc-|
cupation. Specialization’ and close con-|
centration are necessary in these days |
tor large success. |

PARAGRAPHICS.

Every vocation has*its important and |
necessary place in the life of every com-|
munity; cach contributes to the sum
total of comfort, happiness, and prog-
ress. Let no one deceive you by sug-
gesting that one is more or less honor-
able than another. The value of each
to society depends upon the service of
the individual engaged in it.

“There is a perennial nobleness, and
even sacredness in work—in idleness
alone there is perpetual despair—the
latest gospel of the world is, Know Thy
Work and Do It.”—Carlyle.

The earlier young men find out what
they are best fitted’ to do and intelligent-
ly and whole-heartedly get at it, with
the vigor, enthusiasm, and idealism of
youth to their credit—the greater will
be the sum total of wealth, happiness,
and progress.
