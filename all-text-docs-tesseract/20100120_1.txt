Day events at Davidson

On Monday, people came to-
gether across the nation to cele-
brate the life and works of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. In Davidson,
North Carolina, students, faculty,
and community members joined
in Martin Luther King, Jr. Day ac-
tivities organized by Dean Ernest
Jeffries. “What we try to do with
MLK Day is to have events that
will touch a wide range of ages,”
he said, “And also some things that
would draw the community outside
of the College as well as the Col-
lege community together around
celebrating who Dr. King was and

President Tom Ross recently
appointed College Controller and
Director of Business Services Ed
Kania to Vice President of Business
and Finance. Kania will replace
Karen Goldstein, who is retiring. At
their meeting on Jan. 30, the Board
of Trustees will ratify Kania’s ap-
pointment to this position, which
is essentially the college’s Chief
Financial Officer (CFO).

As College Controller, Kania
was responsible for managing a va-
riety of areas including accounting,
audits, banking, budgeting, Cen-
tral Services, financial projections,
Purchasing, Post Office, short-term
investments and taxes.

His new position encompasses
a larger and more strategic role that
includes overseeing about 300 em-
ployees in the offices and services
of the Physical Plant, Business Ser-
vices, Human Resources, Invest-
ments, Information Technology

what he’s meant to us all.”

For Jeffries, the day provided
an opportunity to raise awareness
about the man who spoke about
“freedom and equality and about
coming together, no only for Afri-
can American people, but for ev-
erybody.”

The day began early at 9:30
AM in front of Richardson Stadi-
um with the Martin Luther King Jr.
Unity Walk for Change, sponsored
by Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha
Psi and Alpha Kappa Alpha. Me-~-
gan Lisa °10 described the walk as
“a time to come together and cel-
ebrate. A time for unity.”

More than simply a morning
stroll, the walk symbolized “a very
similar march that was in D.C. and

Services and Auxiliary Services
(Bookstores, Dining Services, the
Guest House and Laundry).

Kania will report directly to
President Ross and will handle
the college’s $100-million annual
operating budget as well as the
$420-million endowment, which
funds financial aid and professor-
ships. His office will be located in
the South Wing of Chambers.

One challenge he faces is en-
suring that people don’t treat him
differently. “I want people to un-
derstand that I’m not different per-
sonally,” he said. “I want to be in
touch with them. I don’t want to
do everything through channels. I
still want people to stop me on the
way across campus and talk to me
about what’s going on. My job is
different — it’s a big job — but I’m
the same person.”

Kania’s goals include “keeping
everyone connected with the mis-
sion of the college and understand-
ing the role each person plays in
supporting the high quality educa-

that made history,” according to
Britney Pillsbury °12. Neverthe-
less, Kiara Boone *11 admitted,
“The Monday morning exercise
doesn’t hurt either.”

Students were not the only par-
ticipants in the walk, which Jef-
fries described as a way to “get
some folks to come out and walk
with them just to show unity in the
Greek community on campus.”
Professor of Anthropology Matt
Samson, who grew up in Louisiana
during the desegregation period,
characterized the walk as “a time
to reflect on what it means to live
across social boundaries. We live
in a different era of activism, but

tional environment,” he said. Both
of these objectives are key to the
maintenance of the college’s suc-
cessful financial condition, espe-
cially in difficult economic times.

“To me what’s exciting about
my job is being able to do what I
do in a place where I understand
the effect that it has on the mission.
The only way you can stay in touch
with the mission of a college is by
getting to know the students.

“You have to understand the
amazing qualities students bring
to the place — how hard they work
here, the things they accomplish at
Davidson and beyond — that’s what
energizes me,” he continued. “It
makes it real for me. The end re-
sult of everything I do is a tiny little
fragment of having students walk
across the stage in four years, and
that’s what makes me excited.”

His outlook on the everyday
financial management that his job
entails is positive. “As I move
into my new role, I do so feeling
confident in the way the college’s

Winter Fest

Thanks to the collaborative
effort of the Union Board, Patter-
son Court Council and the Student
Government Association, Saturday
January 23rd will mark Davidson
College’s first annual Winter Fest.
From 10 PM to 3 AM students can
come to the Union to take advan-
tage of an event that has been in the
works since September.

The committee of students re-
sponsible for planning Winter Fest
has designed an event that will
completely take over the Union,
with hopes of attracting all types of
Davidson students. Up-and-com-
ing artists Mike Posner and Chiddy
Bang will perform in the atrium
soon after the event begins, with a
DJ set to follow their performances
beginning at midnight.

Students will be able to lounge
in beanbag chairs and watch epi-
sodes of Entourage and Sex and the
City in Room 313. The 900 Room
bar will be open for those over 21
and there will also be a game of
Jeopardy from 10 to 12 followed
by karaoke from 12 to 3. In addi-
tion to the free food and drinks that
will be offered, the ever-popular
After Midnight Union Board event
will also be providing free Chick-
fil-A.

The third floor will also feature
a raffle with prizes including a Wii,
an HD flat screen television, and
gift cards from iTunes, Summit and

endowment investments are being
managed,” he said. A number of
decisions were made in 2009 that
reduced the overall risk of the port-
folio while providing strong invest-
ment performance.

Although the economic down-
turn negatively affected the col-
lege’s endowment, careful financial
management and fundraising have
allowed Davidson to remain in a
stable position. “The good news is
that the college was already operat-
ing with a philosophy of fiscal pru-
dence and responsibility,” Kania
said. “We are used to doing more
with fewer resources than many of
our peers. We have maintained a
very low level of debt, and we have
a strong credit rating.

“We also are very fortunate to
have generous donors,” he contin-
ued. “More than 60% of our alumni
give to the college every year, mak-
ing us one of the top five schools in
the country in that regard, and that
includes the Ivy League. Even dur-
