4 ih So.

Frank Santore, the play-by-play
announcer for the Davidson Radio Net-
work, desperately wants students this
winter to come to men’s basketball
games —
and he’s got
the cash to
prove it.

Here are
Santore’s
demands:

:. *Atleast
_ 450students
must attend
every Wild-
cat home
game start-
ing with the
Jan. 12.con-

test against VMI.
*At least 700 students must attend
the UMass game on Jan. 22

Big crowds come mean bucks for SGA.

And at least 1,000 students must
attend the Feb. 4 conference block-
buster against defending league cham-
pion and 1997 Sweet 16 participant
Chattanooga— an event Santore would

like to dub the “Night of a 1,000 Wild- -

cats.”

If Davidson students fully comply
in all three respects, the third-year Voice
of the Wildcats will donate $1,000 out
of his own pocket to the Student Gov-
ernment Association “for anything they
deem necessary.”

“Tf they want to have a party forthe
whole school, that’s fine,” Santore said
after Saturday night’s game versus
Carnegie Mellon. “I'll pay for it.

“But if we get 449 for one game, it
ain’t going to happen. If we get 699 for
UMass, it ain’t going to happen.”

“It would be awesome,” SGA
president Buster Burk said when in-
formed of Santore’s proposal. “A thou-
sand dollars, you could do a lot with
that. Yeah, the best use might be just a

big party.

“I wantto have astate of the school
address after break, and we could have
a party for that. We could have lots of
pizza there and stuff.”

According to Burke, the money
could also go to the Vamanos Van or
Diversity Week, among other things.

Ultimately, though, the decision
would not be Burke’s, as his term ends
in late January.

Santore apparently came up with
this idea after the Wildcats’ near miss
against Wake Forest Wednesday night,
a game that saw Belk Arena house its
second-largest crowd ever — 5,478,
including an unprecedented 851 stu-
dents.

“T felt very proud of the student
body for the first time in my three years
here,” he said of the game against the
24th-ranked Demon Deacons.

“They weren't lethargic. They
need to support this club all season
long, and I want to give them an incen-

tive.”

“T think this school could be the
next Duke,” added Santore, a 1981
Davidson graduate who lives and prac-
tices law in Greenville, Tenn.,and com-
mutes toDavidson and any and all away

sites to broadcast all football and men’s
basketball games, and select men’s soc-
cer, women’s basketball, and baseball
games. “If Duke can have their Cameron
Crazies, we'can have the Battlin’ Bas-
tards of Belk.”

Naresh Nagella of the Davidsonian
| sat down with Gene Graham, a dining
service worker at Vail Commons whom
students know well for both his good
cooking and singing talents.

The Davidsonian: Gene, how long
have you worked at the Commons?

with Gene Graham

Commons crooner
discusses food, gospel

D: What is your favorite gospel song?
G: “Do You Know the Man?”

D: What church do you attend, and do
you sing in the choir?

G:1 go to Ebeneizer United Methodist
Church, and I do sing in the choir. I
love
singing
for the
congre-
gation.

D: What
is your
favorite
meal at
the Com-
mons?

G: I love

Graham: It has been about 10 and a
half years now. I plan on staying fora
while, too.

D: What are your main duties, and
which of those are your favorites?

G:I mainly do the short order and grill
cooking because that is my favorite.
Of course, that only takes a little of my
(work) time. In between meals, I
clean floors or help (other cooks) pre-
pare the meals.

D: How long do you usually work
each day?

G: I do not work every day, but today
my shift is from 8:30 in the morning to
closing (7 p.m).

D: How long have you been singing,
and is gospel your favorite type of
music?

G: I have been singing all my life,
even when I was just achild and, yeah,
I love gospel.

chicken,
and we
do a lot of different dishes with that in
it, soit’s hard to name just one.

D: Gene, you address many of the
students by saying “What do you want,
‘G?’” What does the “G” stand for?

G: I don’t really know. It’s just slang.
I always thought it was just a friendly
greeting.

D: Gene, many diners at the Com-
mons notice that pasta is probably the
most common dish served. Do you
know why that is?

G: I think it is because of the vegetar-
ians among you guys (students). Pasta
is the best dish to serve without meat in
it.

D: What is your favorite thing about
working at the Commons?

G: I love the people here. And, of
course, I love seeing you all (the stu-
dents) come through here everyday. I
am glad you all let me sing during
breakfast, also.

Stoops educates about

homelessness in U.S.
NCH director pays another visit to Davidson

By Jessica GooDsoN

News Editor

Michael Stoops, Director of the
National Coalition for the Homeless

‘dnd through whom several Davidson

students recently experienced an “Ur-
spoke Friday about
homelessness, civil rights, and the fu-
ture of poverty in the United States.
This is not Stoops’s first visit to
Davidson; a year ago he held a box
sleep-out on Chambers lawn during Into

_the Streets Week 1996 to promote

awareness of homelessness. The 12-
hour experiential sleep-out took place
on one of the coldest nights that year.
Several Davidson students also heard
him speak at the 1997 COOL (Campus
Outreach and Opportunity League)
Conference last March in Cleveland,
Ohio.

The speech began witha slide pre-
sentation — “Faces of Homelessness”
— compiled of poignant photographs,
quotations, and music which reflected
the reality of homelessness: 7.4 percent
of Americans have been homeless at
some point in their lives.

Slides portrayed average people
and families living in tents, posting
cardboard signs, waiting in unemploy-
ment lines, motionless, contemplative,
and often praying. Stoops is hopeful
that the Presbyterian church, which has
expressed interest in putting his slide
presentation on video, will help him
fund distribution of such video tapes.

Stoops related the story of Mildred,
one woman featured in the presenta-
tion, who had seen the slides before she
passed away. She said that it reminded
her of photographs taken during the
Great Depression. Mildred, who spent
hours in the Library of Congress pour-
ing over Depression photos from the
Works Progress Administration, had a

fear of banks asa result of her childhood
experiences during the Depression —
illustrated by the 600 one dollar bills
that were recovered from her belong-
ings after her death.

“Look into the eyes of the home-
less people you see,” said Stoops. “One
eye is full of despair and the other eye is
full of hope.” °

Stoops became interested in advo-
cating for the homeless after his alco-
holic grandfather froze to death on a
riverbank in 1959. His Quaker up-
bringing also instilled him with the de-
sire to help people who are less fortu-
nate than he.

“Homelessness has not always
been part of the urban landscape,”
Stoops said. In 1980, federal social
programming was cut by 75 percent
because it was viewed as a “‘safety net”
for shiftless people.

As a result, said Stoops,
homelessness became increasingly vis-
ible during the decade that followed.
The government currently spends
$823,000,000 each year on
homelessness all: over the country.
Nonetheless, distributed federal funds
only cover approximately 25 percent of
what it costs to run a soup kitchen.

In the 1970s a typical homeless
person was middle-aged and alcoholic.
In 1997, the average age ‘of.a homeless
person is 25. ‘Twenty-seven percent-of
homeless people are children. In fact,
“the average age of a homeless person
in New York City is nine,” Stoops said.
“Homeless children are unfortunately
destined to become homeless adults.”

According to Stoops, the govern-
ment must raise minimum wage, re-
form the health care system, and make
affordable housing readily available
before homelessness will abate.

“Any congressman who’s against

_ Taising minimum wage should have to

work for it,” said Stoops.

The National Coalition for the
Homeless is known for its non-tradi-
tional methods of lobbying congress.
At one point, the Coalition served sev-
eral eviction notices to unsuspecting
politicians and even carted the furniture
out of Dan Quail’s office. Stoops him-
self has been arrested 25 times for civil
disobedience, and continues to practice
such activities as stealing airplane pil-
lows and blankets and granting over-
night access to bank lobbies using his
ATM card.

The Coalition lobbies in particular
for homeless voting rights. In many
states, the homeless are effectively pre-
vented from voting because they have
no mailing address. In 10 such states
the Coalition has passed laws granting
voting rights to homeless-people, and it
currently.has voting rights bills in both
the Senate (S.1503) and House of Rep-
resentatives (H.R.74).

Forty-four percent of Americans
are no longer upset by the homelessness
they witness. Laws against panhan-
dling, sitting on sidewalks, and camp-
ing on public property are becoming
increasingly. common nationwide.
Some officials have suggested requir-
ing a license to. panhandle.

In Richmond, Virginia, a law
which prevented churches from feed-

“ing more than 30 homeless people at

one time was recently rescinded, only
after repeated protest.

Stoops believes that socially en-
franchised people should not discrimi-
nate against the poor.

“Nobody chooses to be homeless,”
said Stoops.

“If you want to find out how shab-
bily homeless people are. treated, par-
ticipate in an Urban Plunge.”

As an old African proverb states,
“Poverty is slavery.”

The Outpost will be open for exam week for the first time this
year, from Reading Day (Thursday) to Dec. 17.

The hours will remain from 10:00 p.m.-3:00 a.m.

Delivery service will also be in operation.
