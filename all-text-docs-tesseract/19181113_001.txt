War Work Campaign
Will Start Today

Davidson’s Last-Year Quota is Doubled | Generals Outweigh Wildcats, But Are Not Able to Handle Them—Johnson

~—$4,000 to Be Raised.

The United War Campaign, a stu-
pendous appeal, which should be answer-
ed by the “giving tilf it hurts” of every
loyal American, is now sweeping over
the country. All colleges have been ask-
ed to double their subscriptions of last
winter, so that Davidson's quota this
year is $4,000. ‘This will require sacri-
fices on the part of every man on the
campus, but it is confidently believed by
the committee that not only will the
quota be reached, but it will be oversub-
scribed, Every man in the student bod
has had opportunity to become acquaint-
ed with every phase of the appeal and it
remains for him to ask himself what he
ought to Rive. and then double his an-
swer. It is not neeessary in this article
to show why every man should — give.
That has been done fully since Sunday.
The campaign has been pushed to the ut-
most at Davidson, and a successful can-
vass is expected this afternoon.

The campaign committee far the col-
lege is composed of Dr. Arbuckle, chair-
man; Mr, Jackson, treasurer; Dr. Me-
Connell, representing the faculty; Mr.
Moore. the Army Y. M. C. A. secre-
tary, for the S. A. T. Co; Lieutenant
Candler, representing the officers: E.G.
filly. president of the College Y. MLC.

S. ‘TP. McCloy. fA. Woods, D. M.
Chalners: and C. W. Foreman, repre-
“senting respectively A. B,C and D com-
panies; and C. M. McCaskill, represent-
ing the college students. “Teams have
been picked who awvill canvass the bar-
racks this afternoon for subscriptions im-
mediately after the meeting held in
Shearer Hall. Every man is requested
to be decided as to his gift so that the
canvassers will not lose time. The re-
sult will-be announced shortly after the
completion of the canvass. also the
amount raised by each company. The
floors should work up competitions as
well as the companies. and it is believed
that Davidson will show her spirit .in
this as in everything else. When the
fellows come back from France. eam
everyone look them in the eye and tell
them he has treated them square ?

“It is hard to die at all times,
But it’s harder still to live,
A slacker to your country
If she calls on vou to give.
Give the little that is in you,
Give your all, then give some more,
Tf vou want to hold your head up.
When our boys have won the war.”

In one of the prettiest games of sev-

the first kick-off to the last sound ot the
whistle Davidson's goal was in danger

only once, and that in the third quarter.

was carried to within

around left end saved the day. David

tion and decisively defeated her heavier

antagonists. “he. game was the first
for Davidson, but it showed up the dif

mixture of the good qualities of Flowers

men of last year. His sidestepping is
phenominal, his ability to pick holes in
a line wonderful, and his receiving of
passes uncanny. He caught — several!
passes in which he made 20 to. 25 yards

admit that the Davidson S.A. ‘PLC. ts

Dennard announced this on Monday as
soon ats the signing. of the armistice was

ment he had a twofold motive: — First,
that-the men could prepare to leave, and
second, that the other men would realize
that it was not all over. When inter-
viewed by the reporter; Lieutenant Den
nard stated that he believed all members
of the S. ALP. Co would have a chance
to see foreign service,

If the war is over, does it: necessarily
mean that the §. A. ‘I. CG, work is aver?
Does ito mean the officers will be slack
in the military training: which they are
giving us? No, the military training and
disciple shall contnue just the same,

ast Frday afternoon Campany B be-
gan its training in erench digging. On
the old tennis courts which are on the:
north side of Concord street, just across
the street from Lieutenant Dennard’s
home, is located the havonet’court. ‘The
first line trench is at the west end of the
court. Between the first and second
line trench there is a line of dummies,
some standing and some lying down,
As the boys go “over the top” of the first
trench, they strike with their bavonets
each dummy that they come to, “Phere
is also a second line of dummies just in
front of the third trench, which must
also be struck,

It might be said that this third trench
will be six feet wide and will contain
rbout two feet of water. Te will be up
to the bovs to either do a good job of
temning this trench or they will be |
soaked.

While the hays over there have stop-
ned sticking their bavonets thru Fritz.
the bovs over here have just begun.
