Bot es discusses security,
sketches precinct controls

By PHILLIP DUNCAN
Assistant News Editor

The Davidson Police De-
partment, which protects both
the town and the College, has
been reorganized. Precinct 1
(in town) and Precinct 2 (on
campus) are now independent
and separate units. Jackie
Hughes, promoted from Lieu-
tenant to Captain, heads the
campus force.

Captain Hughes said that
the lack of coordination be-
tween the two precincts had
been causing some confusion.

“Sometimes I would tell an
officer to do something and

Author Miller lauds Truman,

diagnoses current problems

News Editors

Merle Miller, author of
Plain Speaking: An Oral Bio-
graphy of Harry S. Truman
spoke about Truman and the
contemporary political scheme
when he visited Davidson
Wednesday.

Miller, who spent months in
conversation with Truman at
his home in Independence,
Missouri, -before writing the
biography, said he was sur-
prised at the success of the
book.

“I thought the book would
sell fhe usual 20,000 copies. It
was an accident because it
came out at the same time
Dick Nixon was sinking and
the book was about an ap-
parently honest man,”’ said
Miller.

“I don’t think there is such

a thing as a truly honest man.
Some are just more honest
than others.’’

Miller also said that he had
not planned on writing the
book until after his conversa-
tions with Truman.

“T had no intention of
writing a book about Truman.
I had had these conversations
with Harry Truman, and I
slung them together in a
phenomenonally short time--
four or five months,” he said.

Miller has been a part of
Washington politics since
Truman’s presidency and of-
fered some comments on both
Truman and contemporary
politics.

“Harry Truman was a very
simple man. I don’t know if he
was really simple, but he made
himself appear simple. Inde-
pendence, Missouri was sort of

-a macho town when Truman

was born there.
“Why, we have lost what we

had when Harry Truman was
president. God knows what
happened; it just seems to
have occurred. te
“Part.of it is that some fool
invented television, the enemy
of us all. Truman did not get
on television; he had to get out

on the streets and talk to

people who were then able to
say, ‘Here we have a true
human being.’ ”

Miller has referred to. Tru-
man as “‘the last human being
to occupy the White House.”’
Truman offered some compa-
risons of Truman and Richard
Nixon.

‘‘There was a time when
Truman’s popularity was
lower than Nixon’s Twenty-
one percent it was when he
(Truman) fired MacArther.

“The difference between the
two is that Truman had the
right as Commander-in-Chief

him to do something else,’’
Hughes said. “I didn’t think
the problem was all that bad,
but the town commisioners
decided that things would
operate more efficiently if we
were independent.”

Evaluating the status of
security Davidson, Hughes
said that ‘problems this year
are less numerous than in the
past. I think that may be due
to our ‘walking security’
around campus. We patrol the
public buildings on foot and
cover Patterson Court, the
college-owned housing on
Main Street, the lake campus,
and other outlying areas with
the car.’’

Larcenies are the depart-
ment’s biggest worry. Hughes
believes that outsiders are
responsible for most of the
thefts.

“Early this year two school
janitors were taken to court on
larceny charges. Since then,
thefts have dropped off mark-
edly. Youths in the area have
also been caught with prop-
erty stolen from Davidson
students. But in at least one
incident of thievery this year,
outside involvement is doubt-
ed and evidence indicates that
a college student was the
culprit.

“We are here to protect you
students,’’ Hughes continued.
His force is aware that there
are drugs on the Davidson
campus. However, he says,
‘*We will not send an officer

‘into the dorm looking for

drugs.

“If we see a_ student
smoking marijuana, we ob-
viously must do something
about it. Any investigations of
drug use would be conducted
by a narcotics squad. The laws

‘ on drugs are very specific

these days, and experts would

Hughes indicated that coed-

,ucation at Davidson has

caused a few new problems.
“Sometimes we pick up men
on campus from Concord,
Kannapolis, and other nearby
towns who have heard there

are some pretty women here
and have come to. see the
sights. Also, my officers are a
little leery of entering the
women’s dorms even when
called. They’re afraid they
might run into an embar-
rassing situation.’’ Overall,
however, coeducation has not
caused serious security prob-
lems. Hughes credits the
“‘good sense of the girls here’
for the smooth transition.

“The new security phones in
Watts, the library, and Mar-
tin can be very useful if they
are not abused,” he said. The
phones are direct lines to the
police dispatcher in town.

“However, some students
have been picking up the
phones as a joke or out of
curiousity. This is a nuisance
to the dispatcher.

~The Department does not
deal with an area Hughes
terms “vandalism.’’ College
officials at one time asked the
security force to intervene and
halt one of Davidson’s tradi-
tional waterfights But
Hughes did not intend to enter
the dorms and become in-
volved.

‘‘Seats have been ripped
from Love Auditorium, dump-
sters have been moved, and
last year the card-lock doors of
Watts were taken off and
carted to the roof of the
library,’’ he said. ‘‘These
student pranks are sometimes
destructive, but they are dealt
with by Grover Meetze, Direc-
tor of the Physical Plant.’

This Friday Gussie Black
Latta will join the force of
Precinct 2. She is the first
woman to serve on the David-
son Police force. ‘‘Mrs. Latta,
a mother of three and a
Davidson resident, knows
many of the children in the
town,’’ said Hughes. She will
be able to spot those who have
no business being on campus
so we can run them off. And
with the female enrollment
increasing, we felt that the
force could better serve the
students’ needs by adding a
woman to the force.”’
