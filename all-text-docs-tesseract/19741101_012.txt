...New Law OpensRecords

(Continued from page 2)

should the bill be ratified next
month, there has been self-
study on the matter which will
continue ‘‘to arrive at specific
policies for particular offices—
the policies may very well dif-
fer in each office.”

Two other questionable mat-
ters affected by the law are in-
firmary records and financial
statements. Will the law affect
infirmary records, previously
closed to all but the infirmary
staff? Also, should a student
be entitled to review his
parents’ financial records,
such as income tax?

“It’s a matter of the right of
privacy--a matter between
two adults,”’ Terry felt.

Vince Rabil, a Davidson
senior, thinks the proposed

law is a “good thing, because
you never know when things
get in your record that are
false or biased. This would
give students a chance to ap-
peal.”’

x

He compares it with actions
taken by North Carolina
Senator Sam Ervin regarding
the “threatening of civil liber-
ties by computerized files—
information collected on in-
dividuals by various
organizations.’”” Commented
Rabil, ‘‘This law seems to be

-in the same vein.”

Another Davidson student,
sophomore Coty Pinckney '
thinks the bill is ‘‘a good
idea,” but doesn’t personally
consider the issue ‘‘all that im-
portant.

If certain recommendations

made by the North Carolina ~

Association of Independent
Colleges and Universities are
acted upon by the N.C.
Legislature, then North
Carolina resident students at
Davidson may receive up to
$400 in financial aid, regar-
dless of need.

According to Davidson
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr., “‘At present, the
college receives $200 per year
for each student who resides
in North Carolina. However,
this money is distributed ac-
cording to need; not all North
Carolina students benefit from
this state contribution.”

Last year Davidson
received roughly $70,000 from
the state of North Carolina.

Included in the new proposal
for additional state aid is the
request to continue the
present program of a $200 per
year allowance. for resident
students. In addition to this
sum the Association of Private
Colleges and Universities has
asked the state to provide aid
for all private college stud-

“In high school, it makes

sense te keep records closed, *
but I think by the time a
student is in college, he’s *:
responsible enough to know :
the contents of his own re- :

cords.”’

Quipped Pinckney, ‘Since
I’ve gotten this far, I think I’d
be able to handle finding out
my IQ is only 83.”

While the law is due to go in-
to effect in November, certain
“unclarified | ambiguities’’
may calise a delay.

Until that date, Davidson
will continue to study the
possible ramifications of the
law, developing specific
policies. And when and if the
bill is made effective, David-
son College ‘‘will, of course,
conform to the law,” Terry

college hires should be an ex-

history. Secondly, it was
suggested that the number of
professors of history be in-
creased. The average history
class size is 42 students.

The committee is also in-
vestigating an extended

authorized add period, in-
creasing course availability
for freshmen, foreign studies
programs, proposals for year-
round use of the college, and a
viable three year degree
program.

education requirements were
discussed.

Rabil stated that there ap-
peared to be general support 3:
for intramural, but not club %:
credit. Also, attendence in
physical education classes

ents, up to 50 percent of the
average per capita cost to the
state for each student at a
UNC campus.

“If the. legislation is acted
upon, a $400 tuition grant will
be given to each North
Carolina undergraduate for
the 1975-76 year,’’ stated Spen-
cer.
“For the 1976-77 year, an in-
creased $600 grant would be
given,’ added Spencer.

The main reason for
declining enrollment in the
private sector is the in-
creasing difference between
tuition costs to students at-
tending public and private in-
stitutions of higher education.

Total indifference to the
plight of the private in-
stitutions may eventually lead
to their extinction, according
to Spencer. He views such a
prediction as catastrophic.

According to Spencer, ‘‘The
existence of our independent
colleges helps to provide the.
diversity which has been the
trademark and strength of
American higher education.”

“The existence, side by side,
of state and private in-
stitutions has also injected an
element, of competition which

has raised the level of both,”’
Spencer explained.

In regard to the situation at
Davidson, Spencer was more
optimistic. ‘‘We, along with all
private educational _ in-
stitutions are having to cope
with the rising costs of in-
flation, but I see no reason to
begin worrying about major
financial problems.”

The new proposal has been
sent to the Board of Governors
of the University of North
Carolina. There it will be
reviewed and_ hopefully
‘recommended, and at this
time, the proposal will be
taken to the North Carolina

Legislature.
“T suspect that the number
of applications would

definitely increase in view of
the broadened availability of
‘financial aid,” said Spencer in
regard to Davidson.

On a larger scale, the enact-
ment of the association’s
proposal would help to. insure
the necessary balance bet-
ween the private and public
sectors of higher education. It
is hoped that this important
piece of legislation is ap-
proved to secure the future of
North Carolina’s private in-
stitutions of higher learning.
