Rating of Davidson Teams Has
Risen Considerably in Past
Few Years

One of the greatest features of the
class of 1926 has been its athletes—men
who have borne the brunt of attack of
foes of every nature, who have zealously
fought against tremendous odds, who
have won many victories, and who have
gone down in defeat manfully.

It is the opinion not only ofthe class of
1926, but of many others, that the pres-

ent graduating class has given to David- |

son some of the best men in the last
decade. It is seldom that a three-letter
man can be found who is good in all
three sports, and it is seldom that man,
by his fight and spirit, even though far
lighter than other contenders, win berths
over others.

The class of '26 has presented to Da-
vidson two three-letter men, two winners

“RED” LAIRD

of the Norris Trophy cup for the best
athlete at Davidson, and two all-state
football men. When these men made the
mythical eleven it was the first time in
several years that Davidson had placed
a man on this team.

Vance and Laird are unquestionably
the best that the class has for all-round
athletes, and to make a distinction as to
which one is best would be difficult.
Opinion seems to be that they are equal
in their prowess and in their ability as
athletes.

Laird is a three-letter man in football,
basketball and baseball. In basketball he
made his letter for four years, captain-
ing the team the last season. His posi-
tion at this sport was forward. In foot-
ball Laird began in the backfield, playing
with the varsity his freshman year in
several games, making memorable touch-
down against V. P. I, and then kicked
goal to tie them. In the game with
Georgia Tech that year his toe was
largely responsible in keeping th@ score
down. He was shifted to’the line, how-
ever, playing center and tackle. In base-
ball he has been one of the mainstays on
the pitchifig stat for thepast-three sea-
sons, as well as playing in the outer gar-
dens, and occupying the hot corners
some of last season.

Vance won his spurs in football, base-
ball and wrestling. Particularly prom-

a number of good, heavy tackles in the

state.

There are three men whom the class of
1926 will claim, despite the fact that they
will not graduate this year. It was
the fall of 1922 that they began their
career at Davidson, and even though it
will not be possible to cast their final lot
with the present graduating ‘class, the
latter will claim them as their own.

Nick Sappenfield was and is one of the

able to make much headway with the

the all-state position without much
question. Rackley was a triple thtfeat
man, while Sappenfield’s greatest assct
was the use of his head. He broke his
leg in the Elon game, and did not have
the chance to match wits with Rackley
in the Wake Forest game. Sappenfield is

mates will watch the results with inter-

The captain of the past year’s team,
Wick Black, will be claimed by '26. He
can best be characterized by the descrip-
tion, “that pile-driving, battering ram
fullback from Dayidson.” -If a. glance
could be made through the reporters’
notes of all the games, it would be seen
that it was a rare thing for Davidson to
lose a single inch of ground when “Black
back” was called? He was used a sub-
stitute catcher on the varsity nine this
year, and went in.several times as a
pinch-hitter, making a creditable show-
ing.

The new captain for 1927 is also from
the class of 1926, and thus is could be

Oden and Kugler both made letters in
baseball their junior year, but the au-

to only nine, and they did not: receive
one, though each went into a number of

games. Kugler has played first, second
