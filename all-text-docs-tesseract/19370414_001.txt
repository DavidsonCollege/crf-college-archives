The American Chemical Society,
of~which four instructors in the

entire U. S. It is unique in that it

ganization in the world. The so-
ciety has a total enrollment of
more than 10,000 members and ap-
proximately one thousand or more
were expected at the present meet-

It is an interesting fact that the
society is very extensive in the divi-
sions of chemistry which it covers.
At present there are 29 different
sections, each“of which deals with
a separate division of chemistry and
each of which is under the leader-
ship of a prominent chemist in that
particular section of chemistry.
These twenty divisions embrace
practically every type of chemistry
known, many which would seem
not to be of a chemical nature.
There is a division of photography,
one of dyes, one of inorganic and
organic chemistry, and some twen-

turned after the holidays from an
extensive and successful northern
trip, on which they won the only
decision debate in which they par-
ticipated. This was with Washing-

ton. The Davidsonians took the
affirmative side of the Minimum
Wage question.

Before the Washington and Lee
debate, the audience voted as fol-
lows: affirmative, 58; negative 39;
neutral 19. After the conclusion,
the vote of the audience was: af-
firmative, 67; negative, 34; and
neutral 5. This in itself is a com-
pliment to the manner in which
Sugg and Port presented their side
of the question.

decisive. Sugg and Port khen trav-

the question: “Resolved: That col-
lege athletics should be openly
subsidized.”

Next was the debate with La-
fayette in eastern Pennsylvania, in
which Sugg and Port took the
negative of the Minimum Wage
question, as they did at the Univer-
