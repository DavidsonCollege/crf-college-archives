George Washington Big Favorite Over Cats Tonight
__vtldeat Sports

This is not the kind
of stuff that makes
glowing copy for the
Sunday morning pa-
pers, but in view of all
the deserved praise that
is being heaped on the
rejuvenated Davidson
' football team, it seems
in order to point out
one not-too-widely rec-
ognized reason why the
Cats have made consis-
tently good showings
w even with several key
players sidelined with
injuries.

The big reason for
that. in this reporter's opinion, is chiefly the crackerjack job of
recruiting that Bill Dole and his assistants have done. The Da-
vidson head coach didn’t accept his present job until last March,
and besides having to scout around for some good freshmen,
Dole also faced the equally important task of lining up some

‘capable assistants.

To say that Dole has come through in a big way,
would be a gross understatement. In bringing Chuck Cle-
ments and Carroll Hambright to Davidson as lieutenants,
the former Eastern Carolina head coach got what have
proved to be two very good men. But that was only a
start.

With very limited financial resources to work with, Dole
and his assistants have come up with one of the most outstanding
freshman crops in years. One reason for the lack of recognition
of this fact is that largely, the holes Dole had to fill in the Da-
vidson football machine were not the positions which the fans
notice the most. His job was mainly to build up his defense,
and to give his bench some reserve strength.

The fact that the Cat coach has done well was proved, we
believe, by the 38-19 licking given Richmond last Saturday (the
first home win, in two seasons). With not one but both his full-
backs out with injuries, Dole put freshman Jim Shelton into the
lineup. The results of that move provided the brightest moments
for a Davidson football crowd in a while. In 24 carries, Shelton
gained 156 yards for an average of 6.5 per try, and passed 3
times for 60 yards, while his team rolled on to victory.

The guy who might be labeled the Quiet Man in the Cats’
defensive machine is halfback Bobby Renn. This versatile per-
former from Henderson has handled almost all of the punting
duties this season, and right now owns something close to a
40-yard average, not including his quick-kicking. Renn, if you
remember, was the man who kept putting Davidson back on
the offensive last Saturday, intercepting three Richmond aerials
in the last quarter alone. Probably the main reason a whole lot

of to-do isn’t made over Bob is the big factor in his favor— |

he’s one of the most consistent men on the Davidson squad.

The man who plays across the field from Renn on de-
fense has been another standout all season. Tal Broughton
is the name. This solid Salisbury, N.C., product has been

SIGMA CHIS, PIKAS TO PLAY MONDAY

Possible 4-Way Tie For
Top Spot In Tag Loop

By JOHN HANDLEY

The crucial game between the Sigma Chis and the Pikas,
which may decide the tag championship, has been postponed
until early next week, Interfraternity sports director Pete Whittle

said today.

After bad weather had postponed
the Monday and“Tu-ssday games,
the Sig Eps stepped in on Wed-
nesday to knock the Pikas out of
their tie position with the Sigma
Chis in a 13-6 victory. The Sigma
Chis downed the SAEs by 26-0 to
stay on top in the interfraternity
race,

Only two other games involving
title contenders remain to be
played. Today the second-place Phi
Delts went against the cellar-dwell-
ing ATOs, After the Pika loss to
the Sig Eps the Sigma Chis now
have cinched at least a tie for first
place. Should the Pikas win, there
would be a possible four-way tie
for the top honors,

Such a situation would in.
volve the Sigma Chis, the
Pikas, the Phi Delts, and the
Sig Eps (depending on the out-
come of their Kappa _ Sig
game). However, should the
Sigs take the important vic-
tory, they would be undisputed
winners of this year's race.

By these complicafions and the
very fact that they might arise, the
closeness of the race can be seen.
There has been some stiff compe-
tition in the league this year and

as this new type game ends its
second year here, we find some
fine teams developing as the local
Greeks catch on to the new brand
of play.

This week’s games:

Sigma Chis 26; SAEs 0
Sig coach Paul Eastman entered
the attack against the SAE to di-
rect the offensive platoon while
Paul Sellers led the defensive ef-
forts of the top-place squad. The
Sigma Chi reserves saw action’ in
the lop-sided contest which saw
Steve Norton lead the losers’ at-
tack. It was the Sigs’ ninth win of
the campaign.
Sig-Eps 13; Pikas 6
The fine backfield maneuvers of
Horace Ball coupled with a pass
interception and long pass play by
Fred Stowe provided the Sig Eps

with their victory margin over the

Pikas. In the tight defensive con-
test Bill Hanna and lanky Lindley
Behrdsley stood out as the Pikas
suffered their second defeat.
Kappa Sigs 19; KAs 6
A fine Kappa Sig defense con-
tained the KA attack to the tune
of 19-6 in a hard fought contest.

McCall In At
Quarterback
For SC Tilt

Dan McCall, a junior from
Marion, N. C.. will be in the
driver's seat tonight to direct
Davidson's attack against a fa-
vored George Washington team
in Washington’s Griffith Sta-
dium.

McCall will step in as quarter-
back where Jack Ruth and Johnny
Gray left off. Both Ruth and Gray
appear lost for the season.

George Washington, owner of a
4.2-1 record, is a three-touchdown
favorite in tonight’s Southern Con-
ference tilt. But if Davidson con-
tinues to show the drive they have
for the past two weeks, the game
should be a real battle.

If all the spectators present
at last week's game with Rich-
mond had known the whole
story on the physical conditon
of the Cats, that 38-19 victory
would have been appreciated
even more than it was. Torn
ligaments, bruised muscles and
twisted knees were the order
of the day for the team that

Captain Joe Dudley and J. V.
Howell are looking good. Isti Ben-
nett, Gerald King, and freshman

fered in the Harvard game a couple of weeks ago hurt Tal’s
tackling capabilities, so he just blocks ’em instead.

In the line, the big names among the frosh have been Tom
Owen and Jim Patterson. Owen, who usually plays defense,
once on an offensive assignment got three men on one play to
help enable Jim Thacker to hit paydirt. Patterson’s outstanding
end play has worried Cat opponents all season, and he’s im-
proving all the way.

When it comes to sheer defensive ability, there probably
isn't anybody in the Davidson line who can boast more consis-
tently fine performances than Harold Davis. Against Harvard
Davis played such a brilliant game that he received no criticism
at all on the performance sheets which the players receive after
each game. The Gastonia husky is another man who has been
improving with time, and his appearance in the Cat Tine next
™ year bodes no good for any Davidson foes.

There are several others who have seen quite a bit of action.
End Dick Jones, center Chuck Miller, end Jimmy Davis, and
fullback Russell Rogers, all have made valuable contributions in
the seven games played so far this season.

Others who haven't played a lot but who nevertheless
provided good reserve strength for the Cats are Bob Strozier,
Bob Graves, Bill Abernathy, and Bill Taylor.

This week Dickie, who opened
huge holes in the Spiders’ line, and
Jim Shelton, who ran through
those holes, have been picked as
Co.Wildcats of the Week. Without
that combination the outcome of the
game might have been different.

An_ offensive linesman’s daily
work is usually taken for granted
when he makes the alleys for~the
backs, but when a back plows into
a mass of humanity at the line of
scrimmage, spectators wonder who
missed his block.

The spectators last Saturday had
little opportunity to wonder who
missed blocks for Shelton, because
there were very few as Davis had
his man out of the play almost
every time.

During his first two years on
the varsity, Davis has proven to
be a sturdy little block of granite,
having never missed a game on

any account. He has played regu-
larly since he took over a starting
berth his freshman year, but his
outstanding performances have
come during the last few games.
Against Harvard he consistently
opened big holes in the much big-
ger Crimson line. He helped to let
Harvard know that they had played
a football game. .

The: opposing linemen have been
seeing number 51 pushing them
all over the field so much that
they are beginning to believe Stan-
ley Woodward who, in a national-
ly circulated football magazine,
picked Davis as one of the out-
standing linemen in the. South.
Even though he probably will be
outweighed by every lineman he
faces this year, few can pack more
drive and hustle into their playing
than Mr. Dickie Davis.

Even with Jimmy Thacker’s ex-
cellent running and scoring four
touchdowns, Neil Graham's vicious
tackling, Johnny Gray’s fine show-
ing in his new job at quarterback,
and the overall fine playing of ‘the
whole team, Jim Shelton was. the
real spark of the Cat attack.

Jim, who hails from Winston-
Salem, is a freshman who until
last week had been running third-
string fullback behind Henry
Brown and l.eroy Fargason. Due
to the injuriés of Brown and Far-
gason, Jim stepped into the lime-
light Saturday, and gave the finest
performance from the fullback po-
sition that has been seen all sea-
son. He accounted for about 40
per cent of the Cat's total offense

Dear Dick:

My sophomore year at Davidson
1 was working in the sports pub-
licity office, and it fell my lot to
file freshman football games for
The Observer.
gaine I can recall outstanding play
by A. C. Gregg and Roy White,
but at the time my story seemed
to point up A.C.'s performance far
and above that of Roy. It was, of
course, just the way one man saw
the game, but Professor F. L.
Blythe reminded me in no uncer-
tain terms the following Monday
that Roy White had played a ball
game.

Since that fall of ‘49 T have seen
Roy play a lot of football, and
a lot of good football. But I don't
believe I ever saw him play a bet-
ter game—offensively and/or de.
fensively than he did Saturday
against Richmond.

Why go to the trouble to point
this out? Well, I suppose I was
abit disappointed in the coyerage
and credit given Roy by The Ob-
server for his latest afternoon
activity. Again, perhaps, it was the
way one man saw the game. But I
should like to come back four
years later to make amends some-
what and point up the praise I
