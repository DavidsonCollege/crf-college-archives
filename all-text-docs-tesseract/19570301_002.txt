Hectic Week For The Council

Attempting to follow the Student
Council’s wrangling over the elections
system this week left most of us going
around in circles.

Emerging from one of the most hectic
and time-consuming weeks the Council
has put in in some time are several gen-
eral observations which we feel are
worthy of consideration.

While all the members of the Council
are of necessity thoroughly familiar with
the sections of the Consitution dealing
with the Honor System and Student Body
Regulations, there is an understandable,
but unfortunate lack of knowledge. in
regard to the other. less-often encount-
ered, sections.

We feel that every Councilman should
make it his business to become thorough-
ly familiar with the entire document,
simply in order to be able to function
intelligently in his elected office.

In addition, there was a crying need
Monday night for a parliamentarian on
the Council. It was necessary for Phil
Lewis, a spectator whose specialty is this
sort of thing, to rule on points of order
for the Council to proceed correctly.

Grantéd that only rarely does the
business at hand get sufficiently compli-
cated to require rulings on parliamentary
procedure, but when it does, it is impor-
tant that the Council have a designated
member prepared to settle parliamentary
complications.

One of the most glaring deficiencies

is that the Council currently must de-
pend on less than ‘its entire membership
in dealing incisively the knotty questions
which it continually faces. One group
carries the load of discussion and prob-
lern-solving, both at the trials and regu-
lar meetings. The break-down of repre-
sentative government is obvious.

It is also apparent that Councilmen
have no effective means of determining
the prevailing opinion on controversial
issues held by the students they repre-
sent. This failure to mirror the views of
the represented cannot be charged to
the Council.

Students should contact their repre-
sentatives and see that they understand
their opinion on the subject at hand. This
is what should have happened last week
with the impending elections systém
vote, but with a few exceptions, the
Councilmen were left to make up their
own minds.

It is highly probable that the real
culprit is the system within which we
work. At the present time, Councilmen
actually represent no particular group,
except. nominally the classes or entire
Student Body, which elected them. There
is no natural tendency or habit for a stu-
dent to keep his representative informed.

Perhaps it is high time to begin to
consider our entire system of representa-
tion, and attempt to find one in which
the man on the Council is a direct agent
of the students who elected him.

Campaigning Plan Must Be Defeated

. Out of the recent meetings of the Stu-
dent Council and the Elections Board
have come several new and we hope pro-
gressive reforms in our ancient methods
of Student Government elections.

Monday of this week, Creighton Peden
presented a petition to the Student Coun-
cil for further changes in the elections
system, which, rather than being pro-
gressive, perhaps border on the radical.

Under the proposed amendment to
the Constitution, the present sections of
the Constitution forbidding combines,
solicitation of votes, and financial ex-
penditures would be deleted.

In their place, Mr. Peden would put a
weakly-worded paragraph that says in
part that the Elections Board shall “set
forth previous to the election period a
set of definite and specific rules includ-
ind clear-cut specifications of the amount
of money that can be spent by or for a
candidate; these rules and specifications
to be composed by the Board each year
subject to the approval of the Student
Council... .”

What Mr. Peden asks for here is frank
and free campaigning, unhampered by
any rules whatsoever, except those that
successive Elections Boards might see fit
to create.

The Student Body will be called to

vote upon this constitutional amendment
in the near future. This amendment,
which would make cliques, combinations,
and financial expenditures necessary for
a candidate to be elected, must be de-
feated. The elections system at Davidson
must continue to be regulated by the Stu-
dent Body Constitution, and not by the
whims of various elections boards.

There is a need, however, to increase
student interest in the elections so that
they will take the time to vote. This
might be best done by a series of debates
and discussions by the candidates, held
in the Union under the auspices of the
Elections Board.

In addition to creating more student
interest, such forums would enable all
candidates to present their qualifications
to the Student Body. At the same time,
Students would have an opportunity to
question all candidates point-blank on
specific issues.

The end result should be the election
of better qualified candidates who more
accurately represent the views of the
Student Body.

This wouid correct, to some degree,
one of the weakest links in our elections
system—election on the basis of per-
sonality rather than qualifications and
ability —A.W-F.B.

Prodigal Pants Come Home

A friend of ours told us a sad story
the other day.

Seems he sent one of his best pairs
of pants to the College Laundry back
during exams.

Two weeks later when he got around
to going by for them, the lady said she
was sorry, but there wasn’t anything for
that number. Our friend was a mite dis-
turbed. Pants come pretty high these
days to lose ’em in the laundry.

After a couple more weeks of futile
waiting, he determined to at least try '

to collect a little money from the laundry ~

to help finance another pair. Seems
reasonable enough.

But when he went down to register
his complaint and asked’ for reimburse-

ment, the lady produced a little pink tag
which was stamped, she said, with the
date the pants were picked up.

Apparently, the stamped tag certifies
the removal of an item from the laundry,
thus relieving them of any financial re-
sponsibility.

Convinced now that someone had
picked up the pants by mistake, there
was nothing to do but sit tight and hope
the’ error would be discovered.

Last week the pants came ‘home.
From the laundry. Said they had found
‘em hanging on a nail in the back.

But what about that official-looking
certified pink tag?
We wonder.

DAVIDSONIAN POLLS STUDENT OPINION

Proposed Changes In Election System Are Discussed

Because of the intense amount of interest among the student
body concerning changes in the elections system, The Davidsonian
has interviewed a number of campus leaders, asking them the following

three questions:

1. Are you in favor of the proposal to consolidate on one ballot the
offices of President, Vice-Presidents, and Secretary-Treasurer of
the Student Body along with the Editors of the three publications?

Comment.

2. Are you in favor of the proposal to eliminate from the Student
Body Constitution the article prohibiting active and open cam-

paigning? Comment.

3. Are you in favor of the plan to vote in the Student Union as
adopted by the Student Council? Comment.

Their answers to these three questions are printed below. Note
that each answer corresponds to the number of the question asked

above.

Carl Cooper

1, No—I feel that setting up
the consolidated ballot is a risky
precedent.

2. No—But I would like to con-
sider this more fully.

3. Yes—This type of voting
would — encourage citizenship
among the students.

Dan LaFar

Bunny Perkinson

1. No— It is perfectly obvious
that in some cases a man suited
to more than one of these offices
could: be excluded from running
for some particular post. In this
way, a man of abilities inferior
to one excluded could be elected.

However, the idea of some type

of limitation on the number of of-
fices held by a single student
would, in my opinion, insure the
student body of maximum effici-
ency.

2. Yes—Due to the background
of election procedures here I do
not feel that open campaigning,
party systems, and other methods
of electioneering followed in
many similar schools will immedi-
ately crop up in our system. I feel
that the proposed changes would
evolve into a healthy elections

procedure. that would greatly en-
hance the value of our elections.

3. Yes—I am certain that the
advantages have been clearly
stated numerous times and need
not be repeated.

Gordon Bondurant

1, No—Our present system has
given us good leadérship in these
offices. This might be sacrificed
simply to speed election by a few
days.

2. No—not until a thorough
study is made regarding limits
on campaigning and methods of
enforcement.

3. No—In order to get the
largest number of students to
vote, voting should continue in
chapel. I feel this is the only
way in which we can get a truly
representative, non-cliquish vote.

Vernon Hunter

1. No—On a campus the size
of Davidson's, it would be a mis-
take to lose the leadership of a
competent person simply because
he was defeated in another major
activity.

2. No—I am in favor of more
campaigning than is presently al-
lowed. However, the proposal ad-
vocates a position far more liberal
than that I personally hold. I am
in favor of a more moderate
amendment which would include

more written regulations that
would allow more campaigning
yet prohibit the development of
unwieldy political machinery.

3. Yes—I feel that the type of
voting procedure represented by
Union voting is the best and most
realistic means of balloting during
elections. It promises to be a way
of stimulating more interest,
building a more responsible elec.
torate, and bringing issues into
sharper focus.

Reitzel Snider

1. No—this would prevent a
versitile, capable man having an
opportunity to run for the second
office of his choice.

2. No—on a campus as small as
Davidson ill will and personal re-
sentment would run rampant and
do irreparable harm should we
choose to openly campaign.

.3. No—not enough students vote
as it is. I realize that this pro-
posal would eliminate thoughtless,
irresponsible voting, but an office
as important as President of the
Student Council needs a campus
wide endorsement regardless.

Ed Young

1. No— This creates the proba-
bility of conflicts between activi-
ties which would be entered by
the individual.

2. No—The influence of big fra-
ternities voting as a block would
destroy the fairness of the elec-
tion system.

3. Yes—I think that this pro-
posal is worth a try in that it is
likely to bring about a more in-
terested and alert voter.

John Bernhardt

1. No—The basis of the argu-
ment for this proposal is the con-
cept of an office as the culmina-
tion of a personal program of ex-
tracurricular work, and not as the
spoil” coming from being ca-
pable and popular on. campus. The
argument against it is that most
boys do not plan their campus

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Reader Answers Opinions

On Purposes Of Hell Week

Dear Editor:

It is my opinion that Tom Mor-
gan missed the point in fast
week's Davidsonian. He gave the
impression that fraternity Hell
Week serves one of two purposes:
either it builds up the brothers’
egos by tearing down the pledges;
or it promotes “responsibility, de-
pendability, and self-discipline”
in the pledges.

The first purpose is admittedly
bad; the second is not too
realistic. To what extent can a

week of work that is compulsive
and closely supervised, even if
it is constructive, develop moral
strength?

Fraternities may carry on con-
structive projects, but at least one
of their major functions is social
activity. The moral character Mr.
Morgan desires is certainly valu-
able. But most pledges have 3

‘more immediate need to feel that

they are at home and accepted.
Hell Week can help them in this
direction by promoting activity
which develops esprit de corps,

a feeling of unity and belonging
and interdependence, within the
pledge group.

Editor’s Note

activities with only one goal in
mind, and some certainly are
equally capable of working on sev-
eral different projects. I personal-
ly agree with the second view.

2. Yes—We need more empha-
sis on ideas around campus poli-
tics. Politics based on personali-
ties cannot include many people,
but the ideas behind campus life
are the concern of everybody. If
the campaigning is controlled with
espedt to expenses and coersion,
the effect on campus _ interest
should be very favorable; this con-
trol must be firm, however, to
prevent freedom which will
amount to chaos.

3. Yes—There is a_ definite
tendency toward sleepiness and
unthinking in chapel, and to move
the ballots out of that environ-
ment should increase the interest
and thought connected with cast-
ing a ballot.

Sonny Ferguson

1. Yes—-The proposed system
will speed up the elections.

2. No—This proposal would
prove to be too costly for certain
individuals who would otherwise
be the one for the position.

3. No—The results of this pro-
posal. would be less voting on the
part of the students.

Bill Bondurant

.1. Yes—I am in favor of the
consolidation, on the grounds that
a consolidation would effectively
shorten the present election pe-
riod by perhaps two weeks. More-
over, by the tendency in the long
run toward “specialization” in one
of the publications or in the Stu-
dent Government that would fol-
low adaption of this proposal,
more positions would be open to
a larger number of students who
would like to enter into these
activities.

2. No—Davidson, by the size
and closeness of her Student

Body, does not need an election
system of this nature. I feel that.
provision should be. made for stu-
dents to question the candidates
on their policies, perhaps in an

of us need to know more about
parliamentary law. This is even
more true if we are going to use
it to block a measure desired by
a majority of an assembly. To do
such is entirely ethical, for to my
mind the primary purpose of
parliamentary laws is to protect
minority rights. To use it in this
justifiable way, however, puts one
in danger of having the law
turned against him. To be ready
for such emergencies he should
be thoroughly familiar with all
facets of parliamentary procedure.
s s e s * *
Perhaps it would be in line
to suggest a week of school-
ing in parliamentary law for
the new council members
elected this year before they
take office. If student interest
in Council affairs remains at
the high tenor it was this
week, perhaps such training
will be a necessity for future
council members.
e ¢ e e 2 e
This idea leads to what I think
is the primary good to be found
in open campaigning. In such
campaigning the student body
would learn much more about the
qualifications and background of
candidates as well as their ability
to express themselves on their feet
under fire. Further, in voting on
representatives you would leern
what type of platform they would
support in the Student Council.

On the other side lies the fact
that open campaigning with un-
restricted combines would cause
political parties to form. This
would cause a rift in the student
body between two major factions
on campus that would be most un-
healthy for our student body and
legendary friendly spirit. Also,
this might be that a coalition of
the stronger and larger fraterni-
ties would control all campus af-
fairs. A freshman who did not be-
come a member of one of these

3. Yes—I feel that balloting in
the Union and the lobby of Cham-
bers would be a much more effici-
ent method of voting. This too
would shorten the election per-
iod, since balloting could be done
five days a week. The large in-
terest already shown this proposal .
testifies as to the number of stu-
dents who will take a few extra
seconds to vote.

Bill Fraley

1. Yes—I feel that there will
be no conflicts between those run-
ning for student body offices and
those running for publication
positions.

2. Yes—But there must be a
well thought out program which
will not start before next year.

3. Yes—I realize that this is
experimenting, but if it works, it
would be a more efficient system
and far less haphazard than the
one which is now being used.

Ross Smyth

1. No—The proposed consolida-
tion is based on the assumption
that one candidate would not be
suited for more than one job. I
do not believe this would be true
every year—-perhaps never. It
would be more feasible to con-
sider the consolidation of these
ballots after nominations had
been made. Then the elections
board could see whether or not
consolidation would be possible.

2. No—Open elections at David-
son would be practical only if
rigidly controlied, and I do not
believe that such a controlled, sys-
tem would be at al} successful. It
would be better to put more em-
phasis on issues and student in-
terest under the present system.

3. No—Moving elections to the
Union seems to me an unneces-
sary complication of a relatively
simple election system. I do not
think that this is the right step
toward arousing student interest
in elections, but that on the con-
trary, it will decrease student par-
ticipation.

Correction!

in last week's Davidsonian,

I mean forums at some easily ac-
cessible place sponsored by the
elections board. At these forums
the candidates would be allowed
to express their views and en-
swer questions from the floor.
There would be a different forum
held for each office.

In addition each candidate would
be allowed to distribute a limited
amount of literature. No advan-
tage should be given to the man
who could afford to spend more
money on campaigning.

The elections board, however,
plans to go ahead with elections
this year without waiting to see if
Creighton's amendment to allow
campaigning is approved. That is,
we will do this unless there is
strong agitation on the part of the
student body to have us wait to
see what action is taken on the
amendment. We do this because
we feel that even if the antend-
ment is passed, the difficulties in-
volved in putting it into effect
could not adequately be solved
this year.
