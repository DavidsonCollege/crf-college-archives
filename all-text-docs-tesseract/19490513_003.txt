Over a week ago an
official statement
from Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts was issued
the effect that
Norman Shepard, di-

to

rector of athletics and
basketball
Dayidson College, had

eoach at

accepted the position

of head basketball
coach at Harvard.
During the days
following the — sur-
prise announcement it
has been the most

By GORDON SCOTT

topie on the campus,
aud every word that we have heard has been in praise of
Coach Shepard and in sincere regret of his leaving.

TO most of us, Norman Shepard has been as much a part
of of

is difficult to think of Davidson without him. Aside from the

Davidson as any her time-honored traditions, and au
facet Davidson is losing one of the nation’s foresmost authori
ties on basketball, the college is losing a ventleman in every
sense of the word. The effect that he has had on those students
around him, particularly those whom he couehed, can onot be
inewsured in words.

During his thirteen vears at Davidson, Shepard has vear
after year produced quintets that have been a credit to him
and Davidson, While not always Winning, on all oe@casious his
teams have had spirjiand fight that have been uusurpassed
in the Southern Conference.

vroup of factors has served as such a good advertisement for

Certainly no single factor or
Davidson-as have Shepard’s basketball teams.

While some may dispute this, we are inclinéd to believe
that Shepard’s last effort with a Davidson five was his best,
and it is indeed fitting that as a climax to his tenure at David-
son his team should have compiled such a record as did: his
"48-"49 Wildcats.

As Norman Shepard goes to his new post, the thanks and
deep respect of the Davidson student body, alumni, and
friends go with him for a job well done, Best of luck, coach,
Well be looking for a rejuvenated Harvard team in the Ivy
League next year.

With the assistance of a slow bus and a scorching sun,
Clemson's track team brushed off Davidson last Saturday,
handing the Cats their first loss of the season. It avas early

ing time for the meet. The temperature soared to the low
nineties While the meet was being run off, and the sim got
under the skin of several of Davidson's top fight performers.

Jack Gray won the mile event, but became sick and had to
withdraw from the 880. Blake Bradley

little trouble with a bleeding nose but went on to top the field
the diseus throw, It was a pretty miserable afternoon for
all the boys due to the intense heat. The only shade afforded
them was a slim shadow cast by the grandstand, whieh was
little better than nothing.

Bill Pritehett evidently wasn’t aware of the heat as he
sailed across the high hurdles in 15:1 to win the event, ahead
of Clemsoy’s Doffort and Ed Hopper, Cat Hurdling specialist.
In covering the 120-yard streteh in 15:1, Pritchett posted one
of his best times to date. His average for the event has been
about 15:4, but he has come under that. Probably the most
improved man omd¢he squad this season, Bill will be tough to
handle next year an&é should be a top contender in the con

ference for high hurdle honows.

Jack Gray's win in the mile event was another rung on

his ladder of wins since he eanie to Davidson four years ago

In winning the event Saturday, “‘Gunder™ closed out his

college track career undefeated in dual competition——one
of the best individual records in recent years at Davidson,
In defending his string of wins for the last time, Gunder was
pressed by Pulkinen of Clemson who turned on the steam
down the home stretch, However, Gunders long stride and
the lead that he gained earlier put him across the finish line
in front. His winning time was 4:43. :

With skys threatening and

took the first set from Bo, 6-1. Bo
surprised the shivering spectators
by going ahead 5N in the second
set. But like the bumblebee who

is supposed to be unable to fly, the

Southern Conference singles ¢

seemed not to know he was
posed to lose that set, so he took
SIX consecutive games to win the
set, 7-5, and the match.

Clark Taylor, the other half of
the Carolina*l-2 punch, had more
trouble than Seixas, and was forced
to the limit to down the hard-hitting
Veddy Weesler, 9-7, 6-4,

Whit Cobb just wouldn't be
bothered by the ‘Tarheel's reputa-
tion, and defeated» Grunner, 947,
6-2" Mike Williams also was vic-

by

torious virtue of his 6.3, 4-6,
6-2 scores over Rice.

The Tarheels Nos. 5 and 6 men
were on top when scores were

turned in by Henry Neisler and Rob

Palmer

In & mateh which was almost

Cobb combination again was vic-

feated Grunner-W instead with
comparative ease, 6-3, 6-2, but
Neisler and John Crosland lost to
Rice-Wilder, 7-5, 6.3

Five to four is the same score
by which Carolina defeated David-
