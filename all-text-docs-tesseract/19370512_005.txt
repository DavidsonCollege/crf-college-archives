Episodes in Lite of Ney

To Be Given Over WSOC

will Be Third in Br in Broadcast Se-
ries Depicting Dramatic
Events

GIVEN EACH THURSDAY

Script Written By Cates and
McKnight

Peter Stuart Ney, designer
of the Davidson College seal,
is the subject of the third dra-
matic episode of the Davidson
broadcast series over Station
WSOC in Charlotte. The
sketch will be given on Thurs-
day, May 13, at 1:30 P. M.s

The cpisode will open with Mar-
shal Ney’s trial in France and the
execution scene. Then the chief
events in the life .of Peter Stuart
Ney will be portrayed. Though

. given as a short play the outstand-
ing arguments for and against the
identity of Marshal Ney and Peter
Stuart Ney are interwoven with the
action. The story of Peter Stuart.
Ney has recently aroused much
popular interest -because of the
popular biography on the subject
by LeGette Blythe of The Char-
lotte Observer staff and because
of the proposed attempt of Mr.
Allison and others of Charlotte to
exhume the body of Peter Stuart
Ney at Third Creek Presbyterian

Church. *

The script for the broadcast was
written by C. A. McKnight and A.
T. Cates, in collaboration, after
a thorough study of the books and

documents in the Davidson -library..|—

The episode presented last week
dealt with the fotinding of the col-
lege and the manual Jabor revolt.
The script for the sketch was writ-
ten by Gibson Smith and Hal Ov-
erton. The dramatis personac con-

—gisted of Wilbur Edwards, narra-

tor; Professor Johnston, announc-
eer; Tyler Port, chairman; J. S.
Brown, President Morrison; Rich-
ard Vowles, Mr. Pharr; Dr. Cum-
mings, Colonel Davidson; Sidney
Crane. Mr. Sparrow; Walt Dick-
son, Colonel Allison; Bill Mellwin-
en, Dr. Robinson; Locke Vass,
Overseer; C. K. Malone, Bradley,

STUDENTS REGISTER TO
MOVE EXAMINATIONS UP

Final examinations for this sem-
ester have been moved up three
days and therefore the period for
spring term exams will be from
May 24th to June 2nd, inclusive.

This needed change was accom-
plished through the co-operation of
students and caliege administra-
tion in order to create a three day
vacancy between spring exams and
commencement. During this period,
members of the pageant cast will
have free time for concentrated
practice. in chapel last Wednes-
day, Professor Fleagle offered the
student body this chanee to have
exaininations moved up three days
if three hundred and fifty would
agree to stay on the campus three
days and hetp make the centennial
celebration a bigger success. Near-
ly four hundred students showed
their enthusiastic approval of this
plan by signing up within the 24-
hour specified limit.
