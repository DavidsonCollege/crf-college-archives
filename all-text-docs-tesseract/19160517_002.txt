Alas, examinations and burning of
midnight oil have come to the editors as
well as others, and they, too, must
“stretch the traces.” “l'his then will be
the last issue of THe Davivsontan for
this year.

ROOST THE DAVIDSONIAN,

For the past year Tre DAvinsontan
has been a booster. She has advertised
the college. She has advertised and
tried to help every phase of college life.
No activity has been left untouched. It
is only fair that in return every reader—
student, alumnus, and friend of the col-
lege—should speak a good word for her
at Commencement and during the sum-
mer. Boost THE Davinsonian.

THE CLASS GIFT.

Tt has been the custom of the graduat-
ing class for a number of years to present
the college with some handsome gift.
Last year the class gave a set of beautiful
electric lights for the Library front.
This time the Senior class will present
the college with a very handsome Italian
marble sanitary drinking fountain. It
wll be placed at the old college well. It
is of a very pretty design. On the base
will be engraved the class motto with
the class numeral. The class expects to
have it erected by commencement, if not
a week before.

MINISTERIAL BAND HAS
ELECTION OF OFFICERS

At a meeting of the Ministerial Band
Sunday afternoon the following officers
were elected for next year: E. H. Ham-
ilton, president ; G. C. Bellingrath, vice-
president; T. B. Carwile,  secretary-
treasurer. At the request of the presi-
dent, J. G. Pattan made a helpful talk
showing what the object of the band war
and giving excellent advice as to the
work of the members on the campus.

REVIEW OF THE MAGAZINE.

With the recent action of the student
body regarding the Magazine, a new in-
terest is being felt towards this publica-
tion. The issue which appeared this
week is the best that has come out this
year. It seems to be better balanced
than any of the others. But perhaps its
best feature is that it has descended to
the realms of Davidson life. Three of
the articles published were directly con-
nected with the campus. There is a
wealth of interest here if we can only
touch it. ‘The last issue has made a step
in the right direction.

The story “A Tale of Bath” is quite
good and somewhat above the average
college boy story. We are certainly glad
to see that a Freshman is taking an in-
terest in the work of the Magazine. His
story, “At the Devil’s Door or There-
abouts,” is good. It’s plot shows some
knowledge of technique. “Love's Labor.
Lost—Up-to-Date,” is very witty and.
carefully planned. The essay, ‘The
College Man and the Press,” shows
thought and touches a subject which
should prove interesting to all college
men. “Overheard Before Mail Time,”
also touches Davidson life, and should
be interesting to people connected with
the college. Veniens seems to have a
monopoly on the poetry, but he deserves
it.

The Staff of the Magazine is to be
congratulated on the four issues they
published this year.. All of them were
up-to-date and full of interest to David-
son men. There is a great field of pos-
sibilities in this Magazine and it is sin-
cerely hoped that the new staff will find
them.

NUMBER OF NEW MEN

The prospects for the class of '20 are

an era of prosperity dver the country,
and this means that there will be a
larger number of persons attending the
different schools and colleges, and Dav-
idson will get her share. Fach year the
Freshman class seems larger than that
which preceeded it, and we have reason
to believe that next year will be no ex-
ception to the rule, especially as David-

vertising than usual. Our successful
athletic teams, coupled with the endow-
ment campaign, have placed Davidson
under the observation of many previous-
ly disinterested parents, who may, and
in all probability will, consider David-

pare their sons for life.

Y, M. C. A. MEETING.

On Thursday night the last Y. M. C.
A. meeting of the term was held. At
this meeting F. H. Smith, '16, gave a
talk on the subject, “What Davidson
Has Meant to Me.” In this talk the
speaker outlined the followings things
which make Davidson unique among col-
leges: the beauty of the campus; the
wholesome friendliness of the students;
the almost pure democracy that exists
thruout the student body; and the great
regard that this body has for honor. In
closing the statement was made that four
vears of life at Davidson gives a student
a better and higher idea of what a true
man is, and gives also a sane view of life.

A VOTE OF THANKS.

At a meeting of the editorial staff last
week an appreciative vote of thanks was
given to those faithful supporters of
Tue Davivsonian who assist the cir-
culation manager in the office on Wed-
nesday.
