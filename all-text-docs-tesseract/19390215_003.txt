Question

of the Week

This week The Davidsonian has
decided to start something new in
the “Question of the Week" by

asking various:men about the cam.
pus, “What do you like or dislike
in particular about girls?” In view
of the
Day, some of

have a very decided opinion upon

this matter.

student bodies the same ‘question
with respect to boys.
Dick Arnold, Sophomore:

As a whole I like girls, but there

company unbearable by continual-

are certain ones

and generally thinking only about
the appearance they making.
Another bad habit is to make boys
wait for no good reason at all.

Howard Woodward, Senior:
Beauty and’ brains are the prime
essentials with but the more

are not beautiful should possess a
good personality and lots of en-
thusiasm. A girl without a good
conversation is absolutely a blank

and make-up. Most girls realize
that the boys are only  sftooting
them a line and one who can string
the boys in turn, although not

too far, is my idea of an ideal girl.
Ed Morrow, Senior:

I appreciate the calculating clev-
er stupidity that nowadays an
integral part of a party gal’s make-
up. It’s always great, but somewhat
foolish, to fool the fool who fool-
ishly thinks she is fooling you.

George Stowe, Junior:

I dislike a girl who thinks she is
just a little, often a lot, better than
the ordinary person, and who in-
sists on being boisterous, especially
in a crowd. Friendliness, personality,
and, above all else, good looks are
fine things; but a girl who tries to
string along every boy doesn't go
with me. A good sport pleases me,
although the girl who does foolish
things just to keep the party lively
doesn't get far with me. A sense
of sophistication is the best quality
I know, while naturalness and lots
of “IT” are also good traits.
Fred Siceloff, Sophomore:

The chief thing I dislike in
girl is insincerity, although being
too dogmatic is another bad thing.

a

A girl needs personality and an
excellent sense ©f humor to get
along well, while beauty helps.’

Good looks are not a prerequisite
for an attractive girl in my opinion,
but they are a help to anyone, I
admire fastidiousness in private, but
discrimination in dress and make-up
will do more for a girl than constant
powdering in public. Good back-
ground and intelligence play an im-
portant part, though they are of
secondary importance. I like a girl
who treats men as the men they
are and not as children.

Terrell Porter, Senior:

I dislike the sweet, sentimental,
baby-doll type, but like all men I
love beautiful women. Girls with a
line don’t Suit me all, while
blondes, brunettes and redheads are
particularly my type. Poise and
sophistication are very well if not
carried to excess and a girl who
knows how to be
or crazy an ideal companion.
Talking a long time and saying no-
thing is almost as bad as making
their dates wait, or being artificial
in everything they do. I like sym-
pathetic women but not the beau-
tiful, dumb ones with stereotyped
remarks for every The
“gum-chewers” are the
worst.

Bob Kellogg, Junior:

My ideal is a girl under twenty,
unattached, who can carry on an
intelligent conversation for five
minutes without weakening, The
chief quality I admire in a girl is
intelligence with looks, money,
taste, and personality in a crowd,
important as they are, being of
secondary consideration. I also like
a good dancer and a girl who has a
good sense of humor—not the prom-
trotter’s chuckle which always ap-
pears when she thinks the boy has
tried to be amusing.

False Ideas
Soggs took up two or three er-

idea of forcing people into Christ-

His second point concerned the

the idea held by some that only if
we can obtain campus honors, we

selves Christian leaders; however,
