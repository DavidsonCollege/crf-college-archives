From The First

At an enthusiastic meeting on Wedvesday night, March
18, the Davidson College Student Body voted for the establish-
ment of a weekly newspaper. Later, an editor and business
manager were elected and a staff appointed. The present issue is
the firstfruits of this action. The Davidsonian makes its initial
bow.

In the inauguration of such a newspaper, many questions
no doubt arise. “Why a college weekly? Does it have a real
value? What will it stand for?”

The newspaper is largely what its name implies, com-
posed of news. It should be in close touch with every phase of
College life and the life of the community about it. Even in a
small college, life becomes more and more complex, and as the
students are broken up into an increasing number of groups, there
is a tendency not to look beyond the questions and matters in
which one man is directly interested. The college newspaper
should give live information about every group and department
of college activity, keep them acquainted with each other, and
thus promote a feeling of mutual interest and encouragement. In
addition, there are the things which vitally concern évery stu-
dent, and yet which are not well known or misunderstood.

But the boundaries of a college are not the limits of its
campus. In close contact with it every day is acommunity which
is certain to influence and be influenced by the student. The town
column should make every man feel that he has friends in the
town, and their interest in the college should be increased by the
weekly items and topics about it.

The old Davidson spirit which has held sway at Davidson
in tradition and fact for years goes with the graduate that leaves
here... .

The newspaper...can increase the spirit in athletic, literary,
social, and religious life here; itcan be a link between college and
community, alumni and alma mater. The Davidsonian asks for
your earmest cooperation.
