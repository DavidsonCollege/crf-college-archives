Barium Coach Gets
Praise in Write-up

Recently there appeared a very in-
teresting article in one of North Caro-
lina’s most prominent newspapers on
R. M. “Red” McMillan, ’26, and his
coaching at: Barium Springs Orphan-
age, Barium Springs, N. C. He heads
what is probably one of the most
unique coaching plants in the nation.

This institution Tor boys and girls
has more different football teams than
any other educational school in the
country, ‘it is believed. Seven distinct
division teams, “playing in a division
set aside for each team. At the weight
of 80 pounds the tots get their first

taste of football and as they grow
larger they progress in the football
way. From the 80-pound team they

are promoted to the 100-pound outfit;
from there they go to the 110-pound
squad, and so on until they finally
reach the varsity. By the time a play-
er has gone through seven years of
football under one unified system there
should be no doubt in his mind what
to do when the time comes to clip
the halfback instead of tackle him.
For years the Barium teams have been
outstanding in their class.

Coach MeMillan himself has had a
most eventful career on the gridiron
and performing on the track-here back
in the years of 1922 through 1926, Be-
fore coming to Davidson to play he
played for the, Winston-Salem High
School team when that eleven played
Fayetteville for the state championship.

Mr. McMillan said that he had some
thrills while playing football here that
are very cherished memories. He tells
of the time when Davidson held a
strong~V. P. I. team to a #+7°tie after’
the mighty, Virginians had defeated a
mighty Centre team and were predict-
ed to hand Davidson a terrible lacing.
Coaching football is one of the great-
est things a man can do, McMillan
thinks. Outside of the Sunday School,
and classroom, coaches and athletics
are doing more for boys and youth
than anything else, he contends.

“The one thing Barium and Mc-
Millan try to get over to the boys in
training them for the king of sports
is that the game is helping them alone
and not the school or the coach. Give
all an equal chance, Demand respect
and give, the sdme, is my formula for
coaching,” the red-head states.

Varsity Basketball
Has Good Prospects

After a poor season last year, in
which only three of nineteen games
were won, the varsity basketball squad
has. begun practice for the coming
season,

Prospects are bright, and better re-
sults are expected this year. There
is a large squad on hand, and several
more are to be out after the football
season is over. Many sophomores are
on the squad and some will see action
this season,

Four lettermen, Captain Harris, Hol-
land, Lafferty and are back;
they will undotibtedly be counted” on
to do most of the work.

Ross,

Although no games have as yet been
scheduled for the coming season, the
team will probably. see action against
several strong foes some time before
Christmas. Two of their probable op-
ponents will be the Statesville All-
Stars and the Charlotte “ Y.”

NEW MUSICAL TALENT
URGED BY MR. PFOHL

Since the personnel of the Davidson
Band and Orchestra has beén an-
nounced, several letters have been re-
ceived by Professor Pfohl from high
school directors to the effect that many
of their best players at Davidson were
not represented.

Pfohl, whose work has remarkably
strengthened the music department
here, has stated that he is not begging
students to come out for the organ-
ization, but that he would appreciate
as full a representation of the campus
music talent as possible.

Pfohl says that particularly string
talent is needed, and if any violin,
‘cello, or double-bass players are on
the campus, he asks that they use
their talent building up the symphony
orchestra and at the same time gain-
ing for themselves additional experi-
ence.

PLANS MOVING PICTURES

Professor Stoeppelwerth at Con-
cordia College, Ind., is planning the
production of four moving pictures,

time.

these leaders

Mr. Cannon, presidentgof the organ-
ization, gave a report on the progress
and development of textile and cotton
manufactures in this state. He declared
that the textile industry was one of the
oldest industries and that it was ac-
quainted with its A. B. C.’s a year ago,
but since then it had to become fa-
miliar with the N.R.A.and the A.A.A.
workings. Cannon, in his address, de-
clared that the N.R.A. “is a great plan
that is being tried in this country dur-
ing the emergency to increase employ-
ment, increase wages, and control po-
tential over-production.”

In closing his talk, Mr. Cannon
voiced the approved sentiment of the
textile industry, saying, “The cotton
textile industry has supported the
President’s recovery program whole-
heartedly from the first. I do not
think that we should expect less than
a sympathetic, co-operative spirit from
all the departments in Washington.”
