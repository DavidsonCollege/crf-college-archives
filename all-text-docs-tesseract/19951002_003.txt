Students demand meal-

Underclassmen want eating options at the Commons

By Apam Hickey
Staff Writer

The Auxiliary Services Com-
mittee, a division of the SGA, is
attempting to reform the meal plan
program as offered by the Com-
mons in an effort to save students
money and add convenience. The
committee, chaired by Sophomore
Class President Buster Burk, is ex-
amining the five-meal and 19-meal
plans in particular.

Currently, the five-meal plan
is offered only to seniors. It allows
them to purchase five meals per
week in advance at a price lower
than that they would pay if using
cash. :
Burk feels that underclassmen
would benefit from being offered
the plan as well. Those students

who eat primarily at their houses
orin the apartments but who would
still like an occasional meal at the
Commons are most likely to take
advantage of this plan. Atthis point,
such students only have access to
the 10-meal plan, a large portion of
which is usually wasted by stu-
dents only desiring a few meals.

Director of Auxiliary Services
Richard Terry agrees the plan has
advantages, but he has reserva-
tions about hastily making such an
option available without further
study. According to Terry, the
larger 10, 14, and 19-meal plans
are priced on the assumption that
students will miss a certain num-
ber of meals; hence, a lower per-
meal price is charged.

However, students who pur-
chase a five-meal plan would be

more likely to use every meal. The
Commons would have to adjust
the price of the five-meal plan such
that the dining service would not
be losing money on the plan. This
may require rasing the cost per
meal so high that it would be al-
most indistinguishable from the
“door price,” or cash price that
persons without a meal plan pay.
Terry is also concerned that a
large number of students who cur-
rently use 10-meal plans would
drop to the smaller plan, creating
an imbalance which could lead to
serious income loss. He concedes
that the number of students who
would purchase a five-meal plan
as opposed to not having one may
make up for any loss, but he feels
further analysis would be. neces-
sary to predict results accurately.

The Auxiliary Services Com-
mittee has also pursued the idea of
allowing freshmento choose ameal
plan rather than being forced into
the 19-meals-per-week option.
Terry responds that there are two
reasons for mandating that fresh-
man use that plan.

. First, the purpose is ‘“some-
what paternal. The college ... is not
going to put a first-year student in
a situation where he has to make a
decision about whether he is going
to eat a meal on a particular day or
not.” Second, the plan allows a
financial “base” for the Commons
to depend on from year to year.

Terry stresses, however, that
profit is not a motive for Auxiliary
Services as a whole. The college
requires that roughly five percent
of the Commons revenue be re-

turned to general college funds.
The remainder is used to meet costs.

Consistent with this, he
stresses the Commons exists to
serve students: “If we’re trapping
students into a certain plan [with-
out reason], then we’re not doing
our job.”

His goal is to provide plans
which allow students to eat at a
reasonable cost while still allow-
ing the Commons to support itself.

Burk and his committee are
also planning to investigate other
reforms, such as constant orange .
juice availability, gloves for food-
line servers, and longer service
hours.

At the same time, he praises
efforts made to-date by Commons
management; “It’s réformeda great
deal in the last few years,” he says.

Shattering the Mirror Myth

Rally, movie, panel highlight
Eating Disorders Awareness Week

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL

Designed to increase aware-
ness of potentially deadly disor-
ders such as anorexia and bulimia,
Davidson’s first-ever Eating Dis-
orders Awareness Week concluded
last Friday. :
~< The week was-sponsored by
the women’s eating houses, Cam-
pus Forums Committee, Women’s
Issues Committee, and Counsel-
ing Center.

. The program boasted several
events including a self-esteem
rally, a study break screening of
the film Dying To Be Thin, and a
forum featuring a panel of experts
and Davidson students who spoke
about their experiences with eat-
ing disorders.

Asmall but enthusiastic group
of students and faculty gathered in
Richardson Plaza Tuesday evening
to participate in a self-esteem rally
during which participants were
encouraged to “trash” those things
that made them feel ashamed or
angry about their bodies.

Coordinator of Eating Disor-
ders Awareness Week Marianna
Whitehurst and Assistant Profes-
sor of Spanish Magdalena Maiz-
Pefia led the proceedings.

_Once Maiz-Pejia had offered
a few words:about the devastating
effects of eating disorders, the rally
got underway.

Items trashed included bath-
ing suits, diet pills, and magazine
articles and advertisements sug-
gesting that an individual’s worth
is determined by his or her appear-
ance.

At the rally’s conclusion,
Maiz-Pejia voiced her hope that in
the future, men and women will
learn to use their energy “not to
control [their] bodies ... but to cre-
ate and empower.”

‘Wednesday night’s showing
of Dying To Be Thin drew acrowd
nearly twice as large as the previ-
ous evening’s rally. Students and
faculty alike viewed the 35-minute

documentary which chronicled the
experiences of several recovering
victims of anorexia and bulimia as
well as their families.

Dying To Be Thin addressed
the common misconception that
men are immune to the devastating
affects of eating disorders, featur-
ing first-hand accounts by a man

who had struggled. with: bulimia.

for much of his life, as well as by a
husband and wife who had lost
their teenage son to anorexia.

The week’s final event, a fo-
rum on eating disorders, yielded
the program’s largest turnout.

Held Thursday evening in the
900 Room, the forum featured a
five-member panel which offered
information and advice on dealing
with eating disorders.

The panel consisted of Sue
Luke, a counselor and nutritionist
from Charlotte, three Davidson stu-
dents, and psychologist DeWitt
Crosby of the Counseling Center.

Luke spoke of the deadly nature of
eating disorders, explaining the
physical and mental symptoms of
the illnesses. Luke also discussed
the role she plays as counselor to
those suffering from anorexia or
bulimia.” ;

ries of their own personal struggles *

glimpse of the destructior
diseases wreak on the victims’
families.

Crosby concluded the forum,
highlighting typical warning signs
of eating disorders as well as ad-
vising the audience on how to help
someone with a disorder.

Organizers hope to make Eat-
ing Disorders Awareness Week an

annual program which offers valu- ~

able insight into a dangerous phe-
nomenon. As Crosby explains, the
stresses and pressures of college
provide a situation “ripe to ignite
into an eating disorder.”
