The Davidmoanedagain/Friday the 13 5

By TAMMY FAYE

Basketball Coach Bobby Hussey last
week bought a $385,000 condominium
in Florida for use bu the basketball team
between games. The apartment sports
gold-plated faucets, mirrored ceilings,
and 15-foot diameter revolving water-
beds.

Hussey refused to talk with The
Davidphonian after repeated attempts to
contact him.

Assistant Basketball Coach Jim
Baker justified the purchase saying “It’s
important for us to have a place to relax
after all our efforts. We think our fans
would not begrudge us this little luxury.”

Hussey financed the purchase
through contributions to the Wildcat
Club. Wildcat Club brochures soliciting
donations say that the funds pay for
“scholarships that allow starving young
people to have a chance to live through

Carnegie said he wasn’t aware of what
Hussey does with the $8,500,000 the

Soud On Life

Well. folks, it’s been an eventful
week to say the least, and although I'd
like to write a column on each of a variety
of subjects, I shall do my best to limit my
digression to but one article. Now that
I've gotten rid of that mouthful, I'll get
on with the show.

I'd like to say a few words about
IMAC sports. Everyone knows that it is
the most fantasmic legal activity at
Davidson. Why, who can forget those
kick-ass pick-up games we had last fall? I
know I'll be dead in my Baltimore grave
before I do. Sweating is the very essence
of life’s struggle for existence and a
microcosm for the struggle in the world,

you gotta admit. It’s just a wonder that
only five sports are required for gradua-
tion. I know I’ve learned more on the
cross-country course than hope to ever
gain in the classroom.

And another thing, I’m glad to finally
see the basketball team get a proper facil-
ity. Dr. Beatty’s office should do just
fine, and so will Spencer’s office (See re-
lated article p. 3). I really love basket-
ball. | mean a lot. | mean probably more
than you can imagine. I’m just a little
ticked that the Csar has to share a desk
with Vice-president for Academic Af-
fairs and Dean of the Faculty T. C. Price
Zimmmmmermannnnnn. I knew the of-

BUT IS IT?

Club gives him but didn’t feel “buying a
condo is too far out of line with the pur-
pose of the Club, I think.”

tice would suffer a loss of prestige when
they made it a real committee.

Oh yeah, minor sports. The track
team runs a lot. Like well-oiled pistons
their legs churn into the air, eating up the
miles with every stride. It’s hard to con-
vey the feeling of intensity as they whiz
by, especially since you can only see
them for three seconds max. It’s some-
thing to see though. So get out there and
see them.

Somebody tells me that the girls play
stuff too, but I’m not sure what. You
should go see it though. It’s probably
free.

Don't forget to shout at the players
too. Get nasty, like a northerner.
