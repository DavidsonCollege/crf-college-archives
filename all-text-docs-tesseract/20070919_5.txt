THE COMMONS STUDY
Light Side vs. Dark Side

According to a recent study by
the Anthropology and Sociology
Departments at Davidson College,
Vail Commons is home to two dis-
tinct species.

The study, which began in 1947
as a subset of the Milward Jenkins
Experiment, has focused on the
particular habits, customs and mat-
ing rituals of Davidson students
indigenous to Vail Commons. The
data the study found is startling.

Vail Commons is divided into
what anthropologist Beauford
Stevens calls “dueling hemispheres
of xenophobic pride.”

One side, believed to be descen-
dants of Cain, are territorial by
nature, preferring the fertile land of
the “Light Side” nearest the

well as the occasional ululation.
. The millenia have been cruel to
them, however. In a ruthless dis-
play of evolution, only the
strongest of their clan have sur-
vived, fending off the sun's inex-
orable rays of fury through the
development of the backwards,
upside-down, preferably neon-tint-
ed visor. .
Men of the Light Side move in

“Scarface” and
“Mr. T.” They are

The other clan, descended from
Cain, roamed the plains of
Commons both inside and out for
generations before finally settling
in the shadowy cradle of Vail's
western valley, commonly known
as “The Dark Side.”

inhabitants of the Dark Side dis-
play an apathetic individualism
evidenced by their curious

wardrobes of tweeds, Tie-dye,
clogs, and Umbros. Eschewing all
things new or of the “main stream,”
Dark Siders show particular rever-
ence for analogue watches, vinyl
records, used automobiles and
dirty underwear.

Deities of these pagans include
their moon-god, “Donny Darko,”
their god of rodents, the Modest
Mouse, and their Lord of the
Dance, Moby. In their religion,
when one dies, he is ferried across
the River Styx in the Death Cab,
whereupon he will meet Cat
Stevens .

Pass-times of these natives
include Parchesi, observing the
Circle of Life and writing poetry
on one's blue jeans. The mood of
these people can best be described
as morose, especially when un-caf-
feinated.

Hundreds of years earlier, a more
happy-go-lucky branch of Dark
Siders strayed to the % ery

they have been revel- #7
ing in hammocks and
trees ever since.

Unlike the Light
Side, where inhabi- 2
tants are cast away
after their early twen-
ties, old age and wis-
dom are encouraged
here. Beards are a sign

Asked to elucidate
the differences between
her own breed and their Light Side
counterparts, Dark Side denizen
Daphne du Drossier ‘08 said, “They
are Philistines, cannibals, funda-
mentalists, and goons. Many
moons ago they would occaisional-
ly cross the Great Divide to watch
their Panther demigods on the
Television Set. Now they only
come to steal our cattle and our
deep-fried eggplants on the day of
the Commons festival.”

Stevens, who has spent the last
10 years immersed in the culture of
Vail Commons, claims he has
never seen anything like this. “Not
a trace of symbiosis here,” he said.
“These two species won't go any-
where near each other. Similar to
creatures found in the Galapagos
Islands, they have mutated sepa-
rately, and quite frankly it is a phe-
nomenon of science that they have
managed to coexist.”
