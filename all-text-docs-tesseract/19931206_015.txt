Turnovers - Samford 20, Davidson 18

By Robert Lioyd-Still

Defensive pressure and offen-
sive balance have provided the
Wildcats with a perfect season so
far. In their first four matches,

~- Davidson has defeated the Char-

lotte Royals, University of the
South, the Italian National Team,
and Samford. On Saturday night,
the Cats drilled the Samford Bull-
dogs 78-51.

Davidson’s defense domi-
nated the Bulldogs. ‘Wildcat point
guard Chris Alpert provided the
pressure and the Cats defense
caused 20 turnovers, which led to
numerous scoring’ opportunities.
With that type of defense and the
addition of the 35 second shot clock
this season, the Bulldogs were un-
able to execute offensively.
Samford threw up 23 three-point-
ers, most times out of pure des-
peration.

Joey Davenport was the lone
bright spot for the Bulldogs, scor-
ing 14 points. For the game,
Samford shot 40% from the field,
while the Cats shot 51.7%. While
Samford struggled to convert a
pass, Davidson seemed to do what-
ever, whenever they’ pleased.

Two tremendous dunks
sparked Davidson in both halves.
Shortly into the first half with the
Cats down 5-0, Brandon Williams

got the Cats going with a break-
away slam. The next dunk, ten
minutes into the second half, oc-
curred when Jeff Anderson hit
Mark McGuire on a thundering,
alley-hoop dunk. That dunk was
the exclamation point on a well .
played night for the Wildcats.

Coach McKillop stated, “I’m
most delighted with our effort. If it
becomes a constant, we’re going
to have a very enjoyable season.
There’s a better bounce in their
step, more muscle on their bodies
and it’s obvious in the way they are
playing.”

Davidson’s size helped them
against the smaller Bulldogs.
Throughout the night, the Cats
scored at will, from inside or out.
Senior Janko Narat led the Cats
with 14 points and 11 rebounds.
Alpert added 12 points on 5-6
shooting. Williams scored 11,
McGuire 10, and Harwood,
Zimmerman, and Spain each
scored 8. All of this showed the
balanced offensive attack this year.

In the next two weeks
Davidson will face the stiffest com-
petition of the season. On Monday
night, the Cats travel to Winston-
Salem to face Wake Forest. And
then in two weeks, the Cats will
face some other ACC opponents,
Clemson and N.C. State.

Friends: Davidsonian

By Will Cobb

The story of the weekend
would be Virginia’s junior forward
Nate Friends of Vienna, Va., who
scored all five of the Cavalier’s
goals.

With most of the opposition’s
attention on the sensation Claudio
Reyna and offensive threat A.J.
Wood, Friends was able to run
loose and make the big plays for
the Wahoos.

Entering the weekend with
only 7 goals this season, the five
goals was definitely a surprise. “I
thought I would score this week-

end, but as long as we win I don’t
care who scores,” said Friends,” If
we had lost and I had scored five
goals, I wouldn’t be that happy . .
. It feels good to have been a posi-
tive contribution to this champion-
ship team.”

Friends decided to play soc-
cer at Virginia during the summer
following his senior year of high
school. Though he was recruited,
he was not on scholarship, and had
to decide between basketball and
soccer.

Being the son of a college
basketball player at the University
of Chicago-Loyola, Friends inher-
ited basketball skills that convinced
schools such as William and Mary
and the Naval Academy to recruit
him.

He decided to play at Virginia
with the hopes of winning a na-
tional title while receiving an ex-
cellent education at one of the
nation's finest research institutions.

He now has three national
championships, and with his gov-
ernment major, plans to pursue a
law degree. |

Still, the sport of soccer is a
team sport, and the congratulations
should be given to the whole team,
not to one individual player.

Friends knows that as well as
anybody.

All five of his goals were as-

. sisted, which is a tribute to the

teamwork style of play that Vir-
ginia instills in its players. Even
with the probable exit of star
Claudio Reyna, Friends does not
consider himself to be the leader of
next year's squad. Maybe he is just
modest, because he sure is a class
act. neato esau
