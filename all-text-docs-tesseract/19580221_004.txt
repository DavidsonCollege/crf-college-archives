Prof. Lloyd Has |
Speaking Hobby

By GORDON LEGRAND
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Speaking is a very logical interest for an English
Professor. One of Mr. C. E. Lloyd’s reasons for enjoying
speaking is that he must have something unique to say,
and consequently, he himself, learns a lot of interesting

facts.

Probably his most intense of Harry Paschall, he has even

the German individual that he|
could make his own decisions
at the local level of govern-

ternational affairs.

The department felt that the
spirit of the New England town
meeting would be a salutary
thing for Germany.

To further this program Mr.
Lloyd made close to four hun-
dred public speeches a year (in!
German), most of which were’
followed by question periods.

These ‘speeches were his first
concentrated taste of public
speaking. Mr. Lloyd enjoyed’
the excitement and satisfaction
of usually walking away a win-
ner from an audience general-
ly having a hostile element.

His audiences were fascinat-
ing. Frequently he encounter-
ed crack pots of varying cate-
gories — religious maniacs. vi-
sionaries, those obsessed with a!
spirit of nationalism — some’
hot-headed and others calm and
persuasive. ;

As a testimony to the suc:
cess of Mr. Lloyd's mission; to-,

then inaugurated are still fune-

have been swallowed up by |
older German groups, and a few
lrave been “eaten away by the:
teeth of times.”

Today. Mr. Lloyd continues
his interest in speaking by ad-;
dressing literary societies and
social clubs. At the instance

Dr. J. M. Dabbs, writer and
educator from Mayesville, S. C.,
and Mr. W. E. Debnam, radio
newscaster and author from Ra-
leigh, will hold a panel dis-
cussion on integration, at the
monthly meeting of the YMCA
Thursday, February 27, at 7:30
in the Union Ballroom.

Dr. Dabbs will speak in favor
of integration, while Mr. Deb-
nam will take the side of segre-
gation.

Dabbs has contributed regu-
larly to the Christian Century
and the Presbyterian Outlook,
and some of his writing has
appeared in Christendom and
the Yale Review.

Active since World War 1 in
the study of racial retations,
Dabbs has served as a member
of the South Carolina Council
of Human Relations and is now
president of the Southern Re-

Colonel Adams

(Continued From Page 1)

Col, Adams praised Davidson
highly. He personally likes a
small school like Davidson. “The
secret of Davidson is the caliber
of students here.” For this
reason he added, “I want advice
and suggestions from advanced
students. I will ask for it.”

Connected with this, the
PMS&T was asked about rum-
blings about the grading system

used first semester. He said that;

the criticisms were invalid.
Grades were arrived at care-
fully.

-The instructors made an esti-
mate, and this original estimate
was worked over “ten or fif-
teen” times before the final
grade was given. All of the of-
ficers worked on the grades.

Commenting on Davidson Col-
lege and his assignment here:
“Tye had as much fun in six
months as most people have in
six years.”

He said also that the best
thing about this assignment was
working with young people and
watching them shape-up.

Col. Adams’ field of interest
also includes the Davidson com-
munity. He is adviser to the
young peoples group at the
Presbyterian Church, he is pack
master of the local Cub Scouts.
and is vice-president of the local

Present for the ceremony, as

several honored guests, includ-

on the question of whether or.
not to allow campaigning and
was of the opinion that elections.
could be sneeded up by holding'
them in the Union where voting
could take place five days a
week instead of three if held in
Chambers after chapel.

Secretary Stuart and Bern-
hardt were in favor of cam-
paigning: Stuart felt it was
“good theoretically” but point-
ed out that there was not too
much student interest in coun-
cil affairs after elections. He
believed it was “necessary for;
any candidate to make his views |
known to the electors.”

Councilman Bondurant, al-
though in favor of campaigning
“in general,” went on record as
being “opposed to any elec-
tioneering that would lead to
setting up posters and running
around seeking votes on the
campus.”

Bernhardt questioned the
value of the five-minute
speeches by candidates for stu-
dent body offices. Stuart and
several other council members
doubted that the duties of class
officers justified retaining the
offices and, as they “don't do
anything,” suggested the elimi-
nation of junior and sophomore
vice-presidents and  secretary-
treasurers in the spring elec-
tions.

OPEN FORUM CAMPAIGNING

President Smyth closed dis-
cussion on elections with his
opinion that if any campaigning
is permitted it should be of the
open forum type with a limited!
number of questions asked.
Smyth then requested Bern-

maxed much hard work which
began over three years ago when
Professor Trakas suggested that
the college have a language
laboratory.

About a year later the col-
lege formed a committee con-
isting of Professors French,
Trakas, and Watts (chairman),
and authorized it to begin work
on a laboratory.

The biggest problem. that of
financing the construction of
the laborartory. was solved when
Dr. J. W. Jervey, Jr., indicated
his desire to present. the labora-
tory as a gift to the college in
memory of his son.

ANOTHER INCREASE

Asked if a further increase
might be made in the foresec-
able future, he answered by
saying that the new President
might, and possibly would see
a similar increase.

D. Grier Martin, Treasurer of
the College was also very happy
with the results of the meet-
ing. “The tuition increase is
good for Davidson College.”

He emphasized that this in-
crease would enable Davidson to
feel more secure in its present
