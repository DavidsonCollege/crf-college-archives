Hedrick, PIRG Propose
Voter Initiative For N.C.

ByJOHN WOOD
_ Staff Writer

A constitutional and
legislative initiative amend-
ment will be considered by the
General Assembly due to the
initiative of sophomore John
Hedrick.

Hedrick as citizen, Davidson
student and secretary of the
Davidson chapter of the North
Carolina Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG) has

_been outspoken in his efforts to

promote legislative initiative.

The plan for the initiative
proposal: is to give citizens
greater and direct access to the
Constitution and legislation by
referendum.

“The initiative is

Wynn Advises College On

Research Associate for the
Office of liistitutional Research
at the University of Michigan
G. Richard Wynn addressed
the Trustees and other guests
at Davidson on February 20,
1975.

Wynn subdivided American
colleges into three groups.
Colleges in the first group are
those with solid financial bases
offering quality education.
These colleges will almost cer-
tainly remain viable by 1980.
Davidson is in, this first
category.

Colleges in the second
category are moribund in-
stitutions in various stages of
decay. Seventy to one hundred
. such learning places have suc-
cumbed since 1970 and Forbes
predicts that a total of 874 will
fold by 1980.

Colleges in this group are
typically new institutions with
open admissions policies
(resulting in average, SAT
scores in the four to five hun-
dreds), a low percentage of
PhD’s, enrollments averaging
about 800, and libraries con-
taining approximately 40,000
\ volumes. In these colleges
tuition usually pays for 95 per-
cent of expensés.

A third category is a middle
group of colleges which are the
key to ‘future economic
progress, said Wynn.

The history of these colleges
is replete with much failure,
expecially during the Industrial
Revolution, but in the post
World War II boom they met
wih an enormous success.

However, the recession in the
late sixties marked the end of
the golden years for colleges in

general but particularly those
in the middle group.

Wynn noted that there is now
a trend toward declining
enrollment ‘that will become
increasingly apparent after
1978 and by 1987 should be very
much different than enrollment
today.

For example; in Wisconsin
there are now ninety-five
‘thousand seniors in college
compared -with 62,000 two-year
olds. However, an increase in
older people wanting to attend

college will partially offset the
decrease in younger students.

In pricing, public institutions
will experience an increase of
about 16 percent in the period
1970-75 whereas private
stitutions will experience a 23
percent increase.

In short, there is a widening
gap between the cost of public
and private education. In most
cases the endowment of these
colleges will simply not keep
pace with spiraling expenses
and will be directed mainly

Jaworski To Give

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
News Editor By

The 1975 Spring Con-
vocation Address will be
delivered by former Watergate
Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski on Friday, April 18,
at 11 a.m. in Love Auditorium.
At that time, Honorary Doctor
of Law degrees will be con-
ferred on Jaworski, Dr. Harry
B. Price, and Mr. Edward A.
O’Neal.

Jaworski’s topic, ‘‘Our Lives,
Our Fortunes, and Our Sacred

Honor,”’ will be based on the

Declaration of Independence.

Jaworski’s speech at Spring
Convocation will he _ the
highlight of Alumni Weekend.
The conferring of degrees will
be the only transaction _ of
school business; other
scheduled events include a 10
a.m. reception and a 12:30 p.m.
luncheon.

“We want to honor Jaworski,
Price, and O’Neal. The fact
that Jaworski was the special
prosecutor in the Watergate
trial really brought him into
the public eye, but our degree
does not necessarily honor him
for that. I expect we’ll honor
him for ‘special service to his
country as a lawyer and public
servant,’ ”’ said Assistant to the
College’ President Jerry C.
Godbehere.

Jaworski is the son of an
Evangelical Lutheran minister
who migrated to Texas from
Poland. Jaworski grew up in
Waco, Texas, and, along with
his two brothers and his sister,
worked his way through Baylor

in-|

toward operating expenses.

In the realm of student finan-
cial aid, Wynn foresees the
development of a cycle in
which increasing tuition forces
increasing grants of financial
aid with the extra funds coming
out of revenue that would be for
operating expenses. Yet, since
financial aid constitutes a
deficit in the college’s budget,
officials will be forced to raise
tuition to counteract increasing
grants of aid.

There will also be an in-

University, where he earned a
Law degree in 1925.

After his graduation, Jawor-
ski entered practice with the
Houston firm of Fulbright,

Crooker, Freeman and Bates.
Jaworski’s ability to totally
master a Case the night before
it was to be tried and then give
a brilliant performance in

. court the next day brought him

accolades as one of the finest
trial lawyers in Houston. He

‘mechanism that allows the
citizen to petition and enact
directly constitutinal amend-
ments as well as certain types
of legislation,’ stated Hedrick
in a letter to newspaper editors

throughout the state.

Hedrick has received en-
dorsement from N.C. PIRG and
consumer advocate Lillian Woo
for the initiative proposal.

“North Carolina is‘ pretty

much dominated by special in- |

terest groups..from industry,’’
commented Hedrick in relation
to North Carolina politics. This
domination has to some degree
hampered the success of the
initiative concept and another
PIRG issue concerning brown
a_ lung disease in textile mills.

Finances

crease in the number of no-
need scholarships awarded on
the basis of ability and not
need. In effect, colleges will
buy students which Wynn
thought was rather ..ridiculous
in light of the financial aid
cycle.

Wynn spoke of the college as
a financial plant and em-
phasized the dangers of the ten-
dency of many colleges to
decrease the reserves. they
keep to hedge against
depreciation.

“The irony is that areas that
need the initiative the most are
the least likely to see it suc-
ceed,’’ asserted Hedrick. He
also added that it could take as
long as two years before the
legislature makes a decision
concerning the _ initiative
proposal. ‘‘PIRG will be
devoting a considerable amount
of its time this term to the

Brown Lung project,”’
remarked Hedrick.
Brown lung disease is caused

by breathing heavy con-
centrations of cotton dust in the
cotton and textile mills. It is a
disease much like emphysema
where shortness of breath is the
predominant symptom.

This last winter term the
Davidson-N.C. PIRG chapter
leafletted textile mills in the
Belmont and Mt. Holly areas.
Spring term the chapter will

- concentrate on the.Concord and

Kannapolis mills.

PIRG is pushing to both
educate the workers in regard
to brown lung disease and to
pressure the mill management
to lower the cotton dust levels
and conduct breathing tests for
employees at least once a year.

“The best generalization is
that they (the management) is
striving to avoid the brown lung
problem--or listening and then
not doing anything about it,“

(See PIRG, page 2)

Awards Address

became a senior partner in his
firm in 1951. In 1971 Jaworski
was honored:as he was-selected
president of the American Bar
Association.

Jaworski, a Democrat, sup-
ported Nixon for re-election in
1972. His $250,000 a year
position’ with the firm
Fulbright, Crooker and Jawor-
ski made him a pillar of the
Houston establishment. His
selection by Nixon to replace
Archibald Cox as_ special
prosecutor in the Watergate
trials was seen by many as a
sure sign that whatever cover-
up was being perpetrated
would succeed,

Jaworski instead became a
hero. Instead of undermining

Jaworsky

Cox’s work, he began his stint
as prosecutor by ordering that
his staff continue’ with
whatever they were doing un-
der Cox. He then proceeded to
bring about the completion of
the trial and the serving of
justice in months, instead of

the years Cox believed it
would take.
Jaworski’s manner was

always polite yet his absolute
insistence on reception .of
documents the White House
refused to release proved to be
the factor that made the
Watergate trials as efficient as
they were. He obtained most of
the documents, although not all
the ones he wanted, by .sub-
poena.

Jaworski had nothing to show
when he came to “clean up”
Washington. His salary as
special prosecutor was $38,000,
less than a sixth of his salary as
an attorney in Houston. Jawor-
ski’s ambitions were primarily
filled when he became special
prosecutor, and a quest for
notoriety was not a reason for
accepting the position.

The honorary LL.D. from
Davidson is an award for a
man who brought about the
resignation of the President of
the United States. But Jaworski
is not proud Nixon left office.
He fought hard to bring about
justice, but has since fought
just as hard to defend Nixon
from imprisonment or _ in-
carceration of any kind. He
speaks now saying that the
humiliation of Watergate has
been more than enough punish-
ment for the man.
