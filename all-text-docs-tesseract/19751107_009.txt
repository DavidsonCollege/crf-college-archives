Cats down Kenyon
for first grid victory

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Staff Writer

Davidson recorded its first
football victory of the year,
downing Kenyon 14-10 on the
strength of two touchdown
plunges by senior running
back Steve Stec.

Although the offense con-
tinued to have trouble getting
untracked, the Wildcat’s de-
fensive unit repeatedly halted
Kenyon drives with a much
improved pass rush and a
school record of six intercep-
tions. a

In addition the defense pro-
vided what proved to be the
turning point of the game
when Bob Sanders stopped a
Kenyon running back at the

line of scrimmage on a fourth-

and-one situation at David-
son’s 42 yard line with the
Wildcats trailing 7-6. From
here the offense drove 58 yards
for the go ahead touchdown
with Stec scoring from the
one.

Coach Ed Farrell praised
the team’s defensive effort and
was encouraged by the de-
fense’s ability to stop the
Lords when they had to late in
the game.

‘‘We didn’t make any dra-
matic improvements over the
previous weeks except we
played good steady defense
and did not give up the one big

Dropping backs: Mike Harding (45), Byran Ratliff (46) and Tim
Nichols (16) sack the Kenyon quarterback. Defense like this

forced six interceptions.

play. We bent, but we did not
break,’’ noted Farrell.

On offense the Cats com-
piled a total offense of 133
yards with 95 yards in 59
rushes and 2 passes to John
Morrissey from freshman
quarterback Bill Wolar ac-
counting for the other 38
yards.

Still Coach Farrell is opti-
mistic that the offense is
getting better and will contin-
ue to improve over the last
three games of the season.

“We sputtered on offense as
we have all along, however
there was a situation in this

ball game, where we needed a
drive for the winning score,
where we put it together under
pressure and scored the go
ahead touchdown,”’ Farrell
pointed out.

‘We are inching along, get-
ting better all the time, and we

still feel our best game is
ahead of us.”’

As in the past Farrell has
strongly urged the fans and
administration to be patient
and give his team time to
adjust to his new program
which is only in its second
year.

‘It’s hard to be patient
when things are going so
badly as they have for us this
year, but if you start jumping
around trying this idea and
that idea then you never get

good at anything.

“You need to build a good
foundation on which you can
get better and better.”

The Wildcat offense is based
on execution rather than ex-
plosive speed according to
Farrell. He indicated that this
is one of the major problems
for his young offensive unit.

‘‘We think our offense is
perfectly suited to our person-
nel, but there is a lot of
intelligence involved in the
offensive line play rather than
just brute force and it takes
time to get good at it.”’

“I’m disappointed for this
year’s seniors and I’m sorry
that the school has to take so
much flak about the season so
far but if everyone can hold on
their hats, I think the program
is headed in the right direc-
tion,’”’ said Farrell.

Hardaway looks for a hole in the
Kenyon line in last Saturday’s win.

Football team faces Lehigh

with a 7-1 record, including
wins over Delaware, Pennsy]l-
vania, and Rutgers. The En-

gineers’ only loss was to Army
in the second game of their
season. They are presently
riding a six-game winning
streak.

“They are probably. the best
offensive football team we
have played to date,’’ said
Davidson head football coach
Ed Farrell.

“Their offense is the same
as ours (Wing-T), but they
have been making good yard-
age from it, and they throw
the ball exceptionally well.”

Lehigh is averaging 38.5
points per game. The offense
features a powerful running

‘attack led by fullback Ron

Gardner with 844 yards and
halfback Mark Weaver with
527 yards.

Weaver is also a threat as a
pass receiver, having caught
16 passes for 390 yards and six
touchdowns.

The running attack is com-
plimented by the passing of
quarterback Joe Sterrett.
Sterrett has completed 95 of
159 passes this season for
1,489 yards.

Lehigh defeated Davidson
53-6 last year, and Farrell
indicated that this year, Le-
high would possibly be the
toughest opponent the Wild-
‘cats have faced.

‘‘We’re approaching the
game with a very. positive
attitude,”’ said Farrell. ‘‘We
got trounced last year, but
physically, we stayed with
them the whole way. The
players and coaches are all
looking for another shot at
them.”’
