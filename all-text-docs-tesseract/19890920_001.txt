S.A.T.s optional for Davidson admission?

Advisory Council considers pros and cons

«By GARY WHEELER
The ‘Advisory . Council for Admis-
sions and Financial Aid is considering
recommending that the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (S.A.T.) be an optional

part of the application process at —

Davidson College. The council met last
week to discuss the matter.

Ruth Ault, chairman of the council,
said that applicants that chose not to
submit their S.A.T. scores would be re-

tional would simply be a move that
would substitute “one form of testing
for another,” she said.

Ault added that the council has just

begun to consider the matter. “We're.

not that far along in the process,” she
said. If the council were to recommend
optional S.A.T.s in a formal proposal,
then the proposal would have tobe pre-
sented to the college president and the
Board of Trustees.

S.A.T. scores since 1969, Bates voted in

William Hiss, Dean of Admissions
and Financial Aid at Bates College, is
concerned that the S.A.T.’s importance
has been exaggerated by both appli-
cants and deans. Instead of serving as
just one of many predictors of college
success, the S.A.T. has become “a kind

Ramirez chosen N.C. Professor
of the Year from 500 nominees

By TRINAJANIEC
Julio Ramirez, associate

professor of psychology, was

recently named North Caro-
lina Professor of the Year by

the Council for the Advance-

ment and Support of Educa-
tion (CASE). ;

Ramirez was also named
one of 11 distinguished gold
medal winners in the country.
- Ramirez's award makes him

’ the sixth Davidson professor

in five years to be recognized
by CASE.

“No other school in the
country has a record compar-
ing to Davidson,” said Ann
Mosle, a public affairs assis-
tant at CASE.

Davidson nominated Ram-
irez in May. Ramirez was re-

quired to submit his curricu-
lum vitae to CASE along with
letters of recommendation
from students and colleagues.
He was selected from a pool of |
over 500 nominees.

Ramirez’s selection reflects
his commitment to his field.

“The future of the human
race and of all the species we
share this planet with will
depend upon our commitment
as scientists to improve the
quality of life, all life,” said

Ramirez hopes the award
will allow him to publicize his
viewpoints.

“As a scientist, I have a cer-
tain set of concerns which gen-
erally involve the lack of scien-
tists in the United States now,"

said Ramirez. "I think this seri-
ously threatens our economic
and scientific prominence in
the future.”

Ramirez worries about the
shortage of women and mi-
norities being trained in the
sciences, saying the situation is
“absolutely abysmal.”

Ramirez graduated magna
cum laude from Fairfield Uni-
versity in Connecticut, earned
masters and doctoral degrees
in biopsychology from Clark
University in Massachusetts in
1983, and did post-doctoral
work at the Masssachusetts
Institute of Technology.

At Davidson, he is teaching
an. introductory psychology
course and several upper-level
courses in neuroscience.
