Reagan blunders,
Ford gains ground

By BILL PITMAN
Staff Writer

After showing good leads
over Ford in pre-primary polls
taken in New Hampshire and
Florida, Ronald Reagan blew
it.

By coming out with his
90-billion dollar federal budget
cut and let-the-states-take-up-
the-slack-plan, along with
some mumbled something
about investing Social Sec-
urity funds in the Stock
Market, he gave Ford the
ammunition necessary to
make him take cover.

Reagan spent the last mo-
ments before the New Hamp-
shire showdown trying to ex-
plain away Ford’s charges of
amateurism and ineptitude,
and tried to present himself as
conservatism’s fair-haired
hero who would ride into
Washington and clean up gov-
ernment. His boyish smile,
smooth talking, and organi-
zation were not enough, how-
ever, as New Hampshire vo-
ters gave the President a
stunning upset victory.

Reagan, believing he could
knock Ford out of the race in
the early primaries, was forced
to change his Florida strategy.
Breaking what‘he called the
Republican 11th Command-
ment, the former California
governor vigorously attacked
Ford, especially on detente
and slipping military might.
Again, this was not enough.
Ford, having forced Reagan to
defend and clarify his contro-
versial economic plans, real-
ized, after much thought and
deliberation, that he was, after
all, President.

Florida, one of the solidly
conservative states on which
Reagan counted, was chalked
up to the incumbent. Ford,
confident and in charge, had
Reagan gasping for breath
going into North Carolina.
The Californian’s campaign
was in deep trouble and there
were calls from Republican
leaders, notably N.C. Gover-
nor Holshouser, for Reagan to
junk his adventure: Reagan
responded by campaigning re-
lentlessly and by embar-
rassing Ford’s regional cam-
paign manager in his home
governorship.

While keeping Reagan’s
chances alive, the North Caro-
lina victory seems to change
little in the long run. Tearing
the nomination away from an

incumbent President is a
mammoth job. Even during
the depths of the Depression,
Republicans returned Herbert
Hoover as their candidate.

Reagan supporters saw a
flaw in the application of this
precedent, however, in that
Ford had been placed in office
by Congress, not a national
vote. Also, he appeared in the
beginning of the race to bea
stumbling, uninspiring, nice
guy, who was put in a job well
above his ability. After Flo-
rida, this no longer seems
true.

Ford, at least in image,
comes across as the man of
confidence, the man in control.
Citizens see Ford now as
President, a force to be dealt
with, and not as a stop-gap
measure of Watergate.

_ In additon to his problem of
battling an incumbent, Rea-
gan must show himself to be
an alternative to Ford. Reagan
must show how he differs from
the President on the issues.

Reagan must persuade
voters that his extra little bit
to the right will bring big
returns.

On federal spending, for
example, both want to hold
the line, although Reagan,
with his $90-billion budget
cut, would be much ‘more
austere in his quest to balance
the federal budget. Concern-
ing unemployment, both agree
that government public ser-
vice jobs are not the answer,
and that this problem should
be solved by the private
sector. Both oppose forced
busing, but Ford will not go
along with Reagan on a consti-
tutional amendment. Both
disapprove of abortion on
demand, but again, Ford will

‘not support an amendment to

the Constitution, as would
Reagan.

Perhaps the most important
issue, on which Ford is extre-
mely vulnerable, is detente
and our sagging military pos-
ture. Indeed, Ford has drop-
ped detente from his vocabu-
lary; Reagan has not. To
Reagan, Ford’s detente is a
one-way giveway by the U.S.
He has allowed our military to
become number two, thus
threatening our security and
the security of the free world.

If Reagan is a long shot to
replace Ford, why is he still
rynning and what will be the
effects of him staying in the
race? Obviously, long shot or
not, he believes he has some
chance of winning. Perhaps he
has aspirdtions to become
Ford’s Vice-President, al-
though he has denied this. It
is possible that Reagan be-
lieves that even if he does not
win, he will pull the President
more to the “‘right.’’ This has
happened as Ford blasted
Castro (‘‘the International
Outlaw’’) and repeatedly em-
phasized his belief in a strong
military.
