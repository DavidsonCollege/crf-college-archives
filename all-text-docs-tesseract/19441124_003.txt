they did right handily 27-7. The game featured excellent ,

passing and slashing end runs by Laurinburg. Only in
the shadow of their goalposts did the -Wildkittens ever
muster,enough strength to throw back the opposition. ‘This
they did once most magnificently. Laurinburg gained a
first down on the Davidson 3 and three times they plowed
over tackle, but every time they failed to move the ball.
On the fourth they tried again, but the Kittens held them
to stop the threat on the one foot line. There were several
of these spirited stands and it was really heart-rendering
when that big machine finally put it over on fourth down.

Well, so much for the bad side—let’s look on the
bright side of the ledger. Exactly seven days before Dav
idson engaged a light, fast Mooresville Hi eleven and de
feated the outclassed invaders 33-0. Probably the most
sensational feat was a quick kick of 85 yards by Gabby
Bryant.

The whole team played bang up ball, and our
stalwart line kept them bottled up most of the afternoon.
Which leads me to say that we do have a stalwart line.
Any line that can stand out there for 60 minutes against
the onslaughts of Laurinburg and still come back for more
