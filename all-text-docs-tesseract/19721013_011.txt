that if an athelete is playing a
varsity or JV sport. he is
ineligible only for that
corresponding sport in in-
termurals. This allows
baseball players to do in-
lermural track, wrestlers
to play basketball, etc.

Led by nobody in particular,
beat-up SI backed into their first

rest of their schedule. (Note to

look at his record.

Foreign Policy:

President Nixon went to Moscow in May of this year
where he negotiated agreements with the Soviet
Union to limit development of antiballistic missile
systems, jointly explore space, and combat the
diseases plaguing mankind. In March, he visited
Peking where he made a start toward improving
relations between the U.S. and the People's Republic
of China. The President has called a halt to crisis
diplomacy, seeking to reduce tension in such troubled
areas os the Middle East.

The Economy:

President Nixon has taken strong action to flatten inflation and
increase employment. He initiated a 90-day wage-price freeze,
followed by more flexible controls, and introduced a package of tax
cuts to stimulate the economy. The inflation rate has been cut in half,
and the Gross National Product has expanded at a yearly rate of
over 7%. Housing starts are up 42% over last year.

Vietnam: the President has done everything in
his power to bring
peace to Vietnam
without sacrificing
the South Vietnamese
in the process. He
has brought home
500,000 men...
reduced casualties
by 98% ... and
cut spending by
two-thirds. As this is
written, strong steps
are being taken to
27 get the enemy to
cease its aggression
and moke peace.

Young Americans:

President Nixon has signed into law the bill giving 18-
year-olds the right to vote ... overhauled the selective
service system with the goal of establishing an all-volunteer
army ... and has proposed an education program that
would guarantee a college education to all who qualify .
