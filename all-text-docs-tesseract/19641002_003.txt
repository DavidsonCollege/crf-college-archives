Keynesian Economics Set
In 'Changed Market Place’

BY DR. ERNEST F. PATTERSON

Professor of Economics

Changes in the material conditions that characterize a society produce a new
economic problem or problems that require solving. The politicians, the business-

men, etc., through a process of trial and error arrive at policies and develop institu-: J

tions that solve, more or less, satisfactorily, the problem or problems.

Then someone who is com-
pletely, or largely, removed
from the market place, the
scene of action, and who ean,
therefore, better see the whole
Picture, is able to distill the
essential elements from the
great mass of data, and formu-
late a theory which explains
to the men of action what they
have been doing.

Thus Adam Smith, a profes-
sor of moral philosophy, and
David Ricardo, a retired mil-
lionaire stock broker, were able
to explain to the English manu-
facturer and businessman of
1800 what they had done to
establish modern capitalism,
and furnish them with a theory
of economics that served more
or less adequately for over 4
hundred years as a basis for
public economic policy and the
source for economic philosophy
and ideology.

When the material conditions
that produced laissezdaire capi-
talism changed and new econo-
mic problems appeared, which
were solved by the public econ-
omic policies associated with
the American New Deal, John
Maynard Keynes, a professor
of economics at Cambridge
University, produced in 1936
the economic. theory that ex-
plained what had ‘been done.

But there is one other thing
that must happen, and that is
that the society must accept the
changed situation, the new in-
stitutions, as permanent and
abandon any idea that the soc-
iety can return to the “status
quo ante.” Or more accurately,
it must be accepted by those
who, by virtue of their position
and situation in the society,
possess the. real power.

The real econome and politi-
cal power in this country is
possessed by the bureaucrats
who own and/or control the
two or three hundred largest
corporations. Their power is
not absolute, by any stretch of
the imagination.

The new situation has been
accepted aS permanent by the
majority of this: power elite
since the mid-1950's. Although

as late as 1952, they believed
that we could go back to the
good old days, and they con-
trived to elect Eisenhower to do
just that. He, or rather George
Humphrey, his Seeretary of
Treasury, tried It, with almost
disastrous results.

Humphrey was persuaded by
his fellow bureaucrats to re-
turn to private business, and
he was replaced by Robert
Anderson, who quickly revers-
ed the field, so to speak, and
the Federal Government ex-
perienced the largest peace-
time deficit in history and the
country was saved.

In 1960 Nixon acd Kennedy
worked both sides of the street,
but both promised to continue
the same public economic
policy.

So today most of the big
business bureaucrats overtly or
covertly support Johnson be-
cause they know that he is
not going to attempt.to repeal
the New Deal, and they fear
that Goldwater is just honest
or ignorant enough to try it.

That Goldwater is aware of
the reason for the lack of sup-
port from big business is shown
by his answers to questions
on economic policy — or rather
anwers written for him by Pro-
fessor Milton Freidman
University of Chicago and Pro-
fessor Warren Nutter of the
University of Virginia, publish-
ed in the September 26th issuc
of Business Week.

The answers almost sound
as if Mr. Keynes himself had
written them, but anyone with
the least bit of savy ~— and
those hard-headed bureaucrats
in G. M., G. E., Standard Oil,
AT. & T, are the saviest in-
dividuals so far as business
and economics are concerned
— knows darn well that Fried-
man, Nutter, et. al., do not re-
ally believe in the validity of
the Keynesian analysis, and
that not only does Goldwater
not believe in it, but he does
not have even the foggiest
notion of what it is.

In a democracy it is neces-

of:

sary for the general public to
understand and accept the
validity of the theory on which
public economic policy is bas-
ed before it. can be used en-
thusiastically and uninhibitedly
and thus effclentiy and adequa-
tely, by those responsible for
formulating and carrying out
the policy.

This understanding and es-
pecially this acceptance, is a
difficult process because it in-
volves abandoning long-held and
dearly cherished ideas and
notions.

Keynes was acutely aware of
this difficulty, even for such
intelligent people as economists
and he warned his fellow
economists of it in the preface
to his general theory of un-
employment, interest, and
money:

“The diffisvlty lies, not in
the new ideas, but in escaping
from the old onés, which rami-
fy, for those of us brought up
as most of us have’ been, in-
to every corner of our mind.”

Every new idea has to, face
this difficulty and its origina-
tor can expect attack and criti-
cism from his colleagues and
his fellow citizens.

Both (political parties) are
derelict ir their duties. Both

Professor of Economics
Since our last letter, we have completed our first
academic year at Forman-and what a new experience in
teaching it has been! Not only is the general level of the
students in terms of motivation, preparation and discrip-

line a factor, as described in the last letter, but also the :

operation of the educational system.

In this new, developing coun-
try, as you can imagine, things
are somewhat ‘‘unsettled’’—in
the’ words of one of our Pakistani
friends: ‘“‘We are in the process
of making our traditions.”’ Also,
Forman is not autonomous but is
not autonomous but is an af-
filiated college of the University
of the Panjab.

Thus a professor does not
know at the beginning of a
course such things as exactly
how long it will last (the univer-
sity announces examination
dates during the year), how
many holidays will be declared
by the authorities or simply tak-
en by the students, how many
tests he must give, how he will
handle the course and what the
external examiner will regard
as important.

I can't help out but daydream
about what Forman could do if
it could become autonomous and
be adequately supplied with pro-
fessors who have the philosophy
of education that we have in the
United States.

It could then demonstrate what
can be done in higher education
and thus make a real contri-
bution to the massive task of
shaping up the educational sys-
tem here—one of the many prob-
lems the-country is dealing with
in its economic planning. °

As for the MA courses, the
University syndicate has approv-
ed our offering them, beginning
in September. The application
must yet be approved by the
government, which should be
doné without difficulty since the
officials concerned are very
much in favor of our helping
to take care of the large demand
for MA work in economics. The
students taking the two-year
master’s course are at about the
stage of juniors and seniors in
the United States, the BA degree
being awarded here after two
years of degree work.

We have now been able to see
in this developing economy re-
presentatives of the Christian
Church at wotk as ministers,
sociologists, agriculturalists, en-
gineers, architects, physicians,
nurses, technicians, teachers,
etc, It is a real joy to discover

what the Church has done and is -

doing for persons here.

I have in mind a young fellow
who is completing his degree
work this year. Helped by the
Church, he is striving to lift him-
self from a situation of poverty

and illiteracy that is so typical ~

for Christian families here. He
says that if it had not been for
the Christian missionaries, who
began educating him when he
was eight years old. in face of
complete apathy on the part of
his illiterate, poverty - stricken

father, he would probably be.

pulling one of the man-drawn
carts today.

Instead of, he plans to con-
tinue his study of economics and
theology, and would like even-
tually to engage in a type of
work that will make use of both
of these subjects. I have sug-
gested to him the area of de-
veloping cottage industry among
the village people.

In our last letter, I indicated
that I have been very much im-
pressed with the significance of
the socio-cultural factor in de-
velopment and the difficulty of
altering values and institutions
that seems to perpetuate eco-
nomic underdevelopment.

Not only is the type of social
structure significant, but also
the characteristics of the human
resources—the quality and the
quantity. Quality encompasses
the health. education and spirit
of the population, while quanti-
ty refers to the total number,
especially in relation to the
quantity of other resources,

The significance of changes in

the quantity can be seen in look-
ing at what has happened in
Pakistan. Between 1950 and 1963,
the total real national income
increased by more than 40 per-
cent, but with an annual popula-
tion increase of 2.2 percent, the
real per capita income increas-
ed only 8 percent.

The desirability of having a
reduction in the birth rate ac-
company the reduction in the
death rate, rather than follow it,
is clearly seen. The Five-Year
Plans make some provision for
family planning, but it is rel-
atively small,

A feature of the plans is that
the extremely limited resources
are spread too thinly over all
sectors in an attempt to satisfy
everybody. In my opinion, the
planners should boldly move
ahead in certain areas that of-
fer the highest returns— e. g.,
exploiting the abundant natural
gas resources, and putting more
into road improvement and less

into glamorous PIA aircraft.

The public library is for all

upon the recommendation of two
card-carrying residents.

There is also a nervous in.

was most apparent in the feel-

toward the Citizen Council and
other white segregationists: they
feared loss of job. loss of friends,
loss of status and reprisal for
their children.

A part of the same culture,
the Negro population has many

‘| of the same fears as the white

residents, but they have in ad-

j{ dition the real fear for the very

lives of members of ‘their fami-
lies. They live also in constant
fear of property destruction. In

Dear Editor:

When I read Mr. Kimrey’s
piece about the Rochester incid-
ent, carried in the September
19 issue of your always-interest-
ing (let me say) The Davidson-
jan, in which he is rather critical
of the white citizenry of that
city, and in which he states
that the trouble started with
the police attempting to arrest
an inebriated colored youth at
a street dance, I wondered if
Mr. Kimrey feels that the free-
dom which he craves for colored
people includes freedom from
arrest when discovered inebriat-
ed in public places.

National Pundits Tremble
As Davidsonian Predicts

BY MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
‘  Davidsonian Managing Editor

A long roll on the drums! A trumpet blast! Let Gal-
lop. and Roper beware! This week “The Davidsonian”

The editoria) staff has rung no
door bells, made few long sur-
veys, and has consulted no one
in person. Nevertheless, it feels
perfectly qualified to make its
own unbiased predictions.

The opinions expressed on this
page are not necessarily the
hopes of THE DAVIDSONIAN
they are the results of cross-
compiling of polls and opinions
from several newspapers and
news magazines.

Each week a different section
of the county will have its pre-
sent voter opinion analyzed by
the editorial staff. The issue im-
mediately preceeding election
day on November 4 will contain
the final election predictions.
The purpose of this is not to
give a propaganda boost. to any
candidate, but rather to give a
total analysis of the present poli-
tical feeling to the willing or un-
willing Davidson Weejun.

Let the roll-call of. the South-
ern states begin.

TEXAS: Most presidential
candidates are expected to carry
at least their home states—at
this time Lydon Johnson still
holds a slight edge. The minori-
ty vote in Southern Texas seems
certain to be almost totally for
Johnson: and the major oil and
natural gas magnates. are said
to be falling in line behind the
President.

ARKANSAS: Johnson has this
state in the bag right now.

LOUISIANA: The race is even
here with Goldwater holding a
big edge in the northern counties
and Johnson gaining ¢he support
of urban New Orleans. How
many of the Northern Louisiana
Democrats cross-over to vote for
the Republican candidate will
probably decide the winner.

MISSISSIPPI: This troubled
state goes for Goldwater.

ALABAMA: Governor Wallace
has his wish: to stand on both
sides of the fence. Goldwater
gets the largest popular vote
and the unpledged electors,
jump on the winning side.

begins its election forecasts.

GEORGIA: The long record of
support for the national De-
mocratic ticket goes unbroken.
Despite discontent over civil
rights in the rural areas, the
heavy Atlanta vote, plus an in-
creasing Negro vote. join with
the prosperous counties to give
Johnson the lead.

FLORIDA: Goldwater's latest
pronouncements have done little
to solidify his position with this
state’s heavy ‘‘oldster’’ vote.
The Senator from Arizona holds
a narrow lead at the moment,
but a Johnson visit could turn
the tide other way.

SOUTH CAROLINA: Strom
Thurmond’s defection carries
just enough voters to give Gold-
water a slight edge over John-
son. Civil Rigits Act discon-
tent and high emotions add to
Goldwater's strength at present.
but watch for a mud-slinging
battle on the side between the
defecting Democrats under Thur-
mond and the regular party-line
Demos.

NORTH CAROLINA: Refusal
of Democratic
nominee Moore to endorse. the
national ticket points up the
schizophrenia of the Democratic
Party here. While the Citizen-
For-Goldwater organization is
strongly built from many bases
of support and the corresponding
Johnson organization almost
non-existant, fear of Goldwat-
er's. “farm program” down east
and “font-lash” in the Pied-
mont urban areas make the
struggle even here.

VIRGINIA: Edge slightly to
Goldwater. Watch for a switch
to Johnson in the next two weeks
as rural Democrats have second
thoughts.

Total electorial vote predic-
tions in the South:
electoral votes

Goldwater—5 states with 51
electoral votes.

Johnson — 3 states with 43
electoral votes

Toss-Up — 2 states with 23
toral votes.
