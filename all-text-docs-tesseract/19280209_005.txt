THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 9, 1928

Dr. Oren Moore

Speaks On

Parable of Good Samaritan

Sunday evening -at the Y. M. C. A.\
vespers Dr. Oren Moore addressed the,
students of the college for the second
time during the year. He was formerly
heard as one of the speakers on Home-’
coming day last fall. At the “Y” services |
he was introduced by Ernest Milton, |
alumni secretary, as a prominent young |
physician of Charlotte, a former touch- |
down man for Davidson and at present, |
an enthusiastic supported of his Alma!
Mater.

Dr. Moore based the theme of his talk
on the parable of the good Samaritan,
developing the subject in an original man-
ner by giving the attitude of the various |
men who came into contact with the Jew
who was robbed and mutilated.

First there were those men who had
waylaid the Jew, robbing and leaving him
wounded, These men represent that class
of people who take as their doctrine the
principle that might makes right. Dr.
Moore then explained the nature of the
cycle through which

civilization passes. |

This cycle covers a period roughly esti-
mated at 1,800 years. It begins with the |
savage with whom might makes right. |
It then gradually progresses until it |
reaches that stage when the humanitar- |
ian impulse is introduced. It then fur-
ther evolves until it begins to degenerate
and defeat its own ends.

The next men who come into proxima-
tion with the Jew are the priest and the
Levite. Both of these men passed by on |
the other side. They are_the representa- |
tives of the class of people in the world |
today who have the attitude that they can
do whatever they may please with what
they possess. The priest and the Levite
had certain business they were supposed |
to do and helping their fellow Jew out
would have possibly interefered with their
convenience.

But the Samaritan approaches the
scene. The Samaritan was an enemy of
the Jew as a race and as an individual.
He had to have some pressing business to
bring him on the road to Jerusalem. But
he had time enough to stop and give the
wounded Jew medical attention, sympathy
and money.

Applying a touch of his own profession,
Dr. Moore mentioned the fact that the
Samaritan knew the fundamental basis
of medicine. He poured wine into the
wound. As a first aid this was good
remedy as alcohol is a wonderful an-
tiseptic. He then bound the wound with
oil which is the basis of all healing oint-

_ ments.

The Samaritan was a tall man who
helped somebody. Tall in that he tower-
er above the littleness of his fellow
Samaritans and inimical Jews. Dr.
Moore’s final touch was the modern ap-
plication of the parable. Everyday the
more. unfortunate are demanding three
things of us: Our time, money and sym-
pathy. Do we have the “It’s yours, I'll
take it” attitude, or the “It’s mine, I'll
keep it” feeling, or yet, the “It’s mine and
I'll share it” tendency?

dean of the college, there was this year
a smaller number of men who were re-
quired to leave school on account of their
failure to pass the required number of
subjects than in previous This
encouraging fact was due, Dr. Sentelle
believes, to the care with which the stu-
dents enrolled in the college have been
chosen in the past few years. Selective
tests were used in picking the men to be
matriculated and in this way a limited

years.

‘number of men especially fitted for col-

lege work were chosen from a large field.
Year before last there were 31 men who
were forced to leave, last year there were
19, and this year there were only 12.
The continuation of this selective policy
will, it is felt, create a very high scholas-
tic standard for the school and as a re-
sult the number of failures will be re-

‘duced to a minimum,

Dr. Greene was formerly pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Greenwood,
S. C., but for a number of years past
has been located at Columbia Theological
Seminary. He is considered one of the
strongest of Christian characters, and one
of the ablest of ministers, in the Presby-
terian Church. He is a preacher with a
powerful appeal, an appeal that is espe-
cially strong to the young men of today.
He comes to Davidson with a high rec-
ommendation from its alumni at Colum-
bia. A telegram from Joe Garrison, of

College Paper Not
for Provincialism

Lake Forest, Ill. (New Student Service)
—While an occasional editor now is kept
busy trying.to explain to a critical com-
municant why the college paper limits
itself to campus happenings, the editor of
The Stentor of Lake Forest College, has
tried to explain to the student council

why he doesn’t restrict his paper to the
campus exclusively,

The editor, Fred Genschmer, who gently
ignored the council's first summons to
discuss the paper’s policy, was informed
that he is “only an appointee of the
council and subject to its action.” As re-
ported in The Stentor:

“The council point of view was epito-
mized by Mr. Macklin who stated that
the students were not interested in lit-
erary and technical matters appearing in
various columns; that more items of local
interest should be covered; and that the
news should be written down to the in-
terest of the readers. The Student Coun-

cil further contended that not enough
space was being devoted to important
student activities, such as the Junior

Prom, Athletic events, etc. In answer to
these arguments the editor pointed out
the growing tendency in modern col-
leges to outgrow provincialism; that it is
by far easier to fill up a paper with ac-
counts of events with which every reader
is already acquainted, that news articles
were purposely condensed so as to get a
wider range of subjects; and that the

students might voice their opinions in
letters appearing in the paper. The Coun-
cil, however, contended that the school

paper should be more a matter of record
than of - student or comment.”
The meeting ended in a deadlock, and
