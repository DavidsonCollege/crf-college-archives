The Good Earth

This week's Ecological Do-In is: an
effort worthy of commendation in that
it seeks to bring home the immediacy
of the problems which have occurred
through man’s unthinking neglect of

his environment.

The work details and the request
that automobiles not be used in Da-

» vidson will be valuable object les-
in the sacrifices which
‘ be made if our enviromental problems

sons

are to be solved.

Yet, when all is done, a great deal
remains to be said. The ecological
disruption which now confronts us is
inextricably bound up with the un-
technological
which has occurred in this country
over the last half century, an advance
from which all of us profit in one

way or another.

And since all of us have profited is
this technological prostitution
of nature, it follows that all of us must
be {in some way inconvenienced by
controls on this technology. A ‘“DoIn”

Thirdly this change in the social
calendar would eliminate the big re-
view trap that inevitably follows on
the week after one of our blow-ups—
and some don’t even find their books
until Tuesday—some don’t even look
for them until then.

Lastly, such a change would hope-
fully revamp the social life in such
a way as to improve our attitude to-
ward the opposite sex which hits an
all time low on these occassions—and
also our whole emphasis as far as
social life—-less strenuous and less of
a sham, but perhaps more frequent,
and really more enjoyable.

Cut Time

Faculty academic
is still alive and well at Davidson
College. It was last seen at Mon-
day’s faculty meeting.

First the faculty voted down a pro-
posal which would have allowed stu-
dents unlimited cuts._Perhaps’ their

conservativism

logic. is sound since professors can

generally set their own cut rules.
However a second: move, one which

reaffirmed the rule that professors

must turn in to the registrar a list

of every student's cuts, deserves un-

qualified ridicule.

If a professor is satisfied that a
student has passed his course, of what
use is a record of cuts? Perhaps in
spite of the BlueSky attitude, rules
still precede educating students when
it comes to administrative priorities.

| Beckmann Doubts Faculty Logic;
Baskin Asserts ROTC Must Go

To the Editor:

Quite recently on this
campus there have occur-
red two events ‘which I
find totally _pérplexing._In
- the first case, the faculty
voted to deny that what was
actually happening was
actually happening, and in
the-» second, the students
voted to ignore the fact that
the=,faculty did not mean
what it had said. I refer, of
urse, to the seething is-
“of open dormitories.
»what ‘little second-
, information I have

The first reason could bé
called the ‘Moral -Argu-
ment.” The argument is
that there are certain
basic moral standards that
‘ah individual professor
hag; by: voting fer open
dotms,**the professor feels

. that either (1) this will en-
able (or cause) the student
to transgress those morals
more. easily, or (2). in .so
voting, he has violated his
own sense of morality.

As-'to the fit point, a
student should, .of course,
respect the moral stand-
ards ‘of a faculty member
: (0% anyone -else, for. that
matter) as a set of personal
beliefs; But by the same

ly

token, the faculty’ member
should so respect the stu-
dent's morals—needless to
say, these two sets. of per-
sonal beliefs need not coin-
cide,

In the second case,
faculty member may feel
that by voting against open
dorms he is condoning a
proclivity toward homosex-
ual activity (given the pre-
sent composition of the Da-

‘ vidson student body) which,

rie

’

in our progressive society, is
objectionable under any cir-
cumstances.

The second reason could
be called the ‘Argument

@ormitory. structure does not
provide sisitable conditions
<‘openzdorms. ‘This is ptv-

.» Mably: tev, “but®(1) students

have been living under such
“unsuitable conditions” for
some: time, and (2) even
though they (and not the
faculty) will be the ones to
suffer from*.such circums
stances, nevertheless they
still appear to desire open
dorms.

The primary point’ is that
adoption of the epen dorm
program will not appreciab-
ly increase student housing
problems simply . because
whatever problems might a-
rise probably already exist.
To use thé argument of de-
sign, is simply a case of
denying that what is actually
happening is actually hap-

the

pening.

As I see it, the main ques-
tion to be considered is:
if the faculty rejects the
plan, how will it ° enforce
its stand? But, of course,
this assumes that the fac-
ulty really means what it
says. I suppose the best
solution is to continue un-
der the existing program,

placency under the Hypo-

about Earth Day, April 22,/

in the entire newspaper.

That is inexcusable. Ad-
mittedly, our ECOS or-
ganization did not choose to
do spectacular things on
April 22. We chose to help
with the community clean-
up and to try to call people's
attentioh to the whole pro-
blem by circulating pam-
phlets and petitions. We
didn't burn an automobile
nor did we lynch an indus-
trialist. That might have
gotten a little publicity, but
it would have helped no-
thing. :

The famous apathy of Da-
vidson students is palpable
irk regard, to this issue—al-
‘most no one volunteered to
help with the automobile
boycott. Perhaps because
they didn’t understand ex-
actly what is was to be,
but more likely because it
meant that tney wouldn't
get to drive their cars from
the dormitory to the frater-
nity house at lunch and sup-
per.

Quite a few people did
volunteer for the clean-up
and maybe we picked up
all the litter that was de-
posited spring frolics. But
I'm being unnecessarily bit-
ter. The whole point of the
movement, the whole point
of Earth Day, was to make
people. understand. that

everything rests. on the in- .«

dividual.

ing to have our teach-in on

excellent program schegul-
ed and the publicity for it
will come out shortly. After
that, the real job begins.
ECOS must continue as a
vital organization on cam-
pus—there is an infinity of
ways we could help solve
some of the problems of the
county and the state. There
is a wealth of talent and in-
fluence on this campus and
it needn’t be as slothful as
it has been up to now. THE

enormously if it would give

needs and deserves.

feel that the article on

this false impression by

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter in
response to the pamphlet
recenlty circulated to the
student body concerning er-
rors by the CRC, the Ex-
ecutive Committee, and
the Admissions Committee,

What disturbs me are the
references to ‘dropping out
of school. to get’ the ROTC,
the only legal means to do
so."’ This indicates to me a
lack of: moral courage and
intellectual fiber on the part
of the student involved in
the attempt to get out of
ROTC. ~ NGS)

There is another legal
means to get out of ROTC,
which takes more ‘courage

setae aotres tec

~are stated

and initiative, but.is a much
more honest approach, and
in the long run has greater
benefits in improvement of
the social matrix in which
we find ourselves in this
gountry. This means is re-
signation from the ROTC
program.

Dropping out of school to
get out of ROTC seems to
be somewhat _ intellectually
dishonest, because: 1. It is
an avoidance of facing the
issue. with the ROTC de-
partment personnel on the
basis of an intellectual or
moral conviction on the part
of the person resigning
which is antithetical to pro
per service as an. officer;
and/or 2. It is taking advant
age of the benefits of the

ROTC program ti.e., $50 a
month) without proper in-
tent of fulfilling the  con-

tract: ethical considerations

implicit in the nature of a

contract call for at léast an
effort on the part of the one
who is resigning to offer te
pay back part or all of the
money paid to him if he
does not wish to fulfill the
contract.

A frank “resignation will
at one ‘and the same
time illustrate disillusion
ment with the military, forc-
ing reform in order to run
the Armed Forces at all,
and, if the basic complaints
clearly and
enough times, will give a
basis on which to build re-
form.

-In this case, dropping out
is copping out. and seems
to me to be a very poor
approach to the problem of
getting out of ROTC.
