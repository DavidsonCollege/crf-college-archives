Eating House rivalries lead to prank war

Once again, the annual Court Selection
Night was affected by the long-standing
and often violent rivalries between eating
houses, leading to mischief, tomfoolery,
and high jinks. According to the Davidson
College Police Department, the number of
reported eggings, break-ins, vandalism
events, and other pranks increased two-
fold since last year’s Court Selection night.

Said Patterson Court Council (PCC)
president and Rusk member Jennifer
Craftall ’06, “While the fierce rivalry be-
tween eating houses is an old and storied
Davidson tradition, it cannot devolve into
mayhem as it did this past weekend. All
Patterson Court activities should be car-
ried out with the utmost respect for the
Code of Responsibility, Honor Code, and
the wishes of the PCC for a peaceful and
fun night. I guess those bimbos in Warner
didn’t get the message.”

Members of the administration had
been worried about the escalating vio-
lence for several years and had made
many changes to try and tone down the
rivalries. Said Patterson Court Advisor
Molly Wilson, “We thought we had finally
ended the cycle of violence last year, when
the reported infractions were at an all
time low. For one, the changed method of

Soon, the houses will lose their connota-
tions, and women in one house might
even have friends in another. Also, the
change in title of ‘Self Selection Night’ to
‘Court Selection Night’ should help to
stem the violence by decreasing the re-
sentment of women who did not get into

their first choice house.”

Missy Rogers '08 disagreed that it
would be possible to end the rivalries. “I
am a third generation Connor, and ever
since I could talk, I knew that I hated
Turner. My mother wouldn't let me have
anything green in my room growing up,
and I remember her teaching me the old
anti-Turner song, ‘Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya,

Rusk Court Selection cancelled
due to condiment shortage

While all of the other eating houses on
Patterson Court were initiating their new
freshmen by dumping various condi-
ments and dessert toppings on them Fri-
day night, the members of Rusk were
having to explain to their freshmen why
they were not being given the same loving
treatment.

As it turned out, just prior to the Friday
night Court Selection festivities, Rusk’s
ample supply of condiments that had
been reserved for their freshmen turned

up empty.

Unfortunately for members of
the Rusk House, these
condiment bottles were empty

Upon arriving to the house Friday

» gvening to prepare for the event, the up-
_ perclassmen of Rusk began checking their
_ supplies only to find that all of the bottles
_ of chosen condiments were either empty
or missing, and, being that it was Friday
' night and the Food Lion was already
closed for the night, there was no time to
run out and restock the supplies before
_ the freshmen arrived at the house.

“All of the bottles were clearly marked
‘DO NOT USE: For Self-Selection Pur-
' poses Only.’ I don’t know how $300
| worth of condiments could have disap-
_ peared so fast!” said Rusk president Kara
_ Hastworn’o5.

Lily Singler ‘06, another Rusk member
explained, “The food really wasn’t too
great this week, and there were a ton of
leftovers that needed to get eaten. Instead
of just throwing all of it out, we figured
that it couldn’t hurt to use some of the
condiments to spice up the food so that it
would at least be edible. Who would have
thought that we could’ve used it all up in
less than a week.”

Some of the condiments were even

tasted so good”

eaten without accompanying food. Said
Marie Lee Masters ’07, “We just started
having our regular ketchup eating contest,
but then we got a little bit carried away
and started squirting ketchup into each
other’s mouths. That was fine, but it got
really crazy as soon as the mustard came
out. Eating whipped cream with chocolate
syrup for dessert made the whole thing
magically delicious and a great college
memory.”

Needless to say, the first year Rusk in-
ductees were disappointed. “I was really
looking forward to getting crap dumped
all over me. It’s supposed to be tradition.
All of the guys thought we were really
lame and wouldn’t come near us all
night,” complained Rusk initiate Jennifer
Mark’o8. “Instead, they kept going after
Connor girls covered in chocolate.”

Masters also regretted the lack of tradi-
tional Court Selection events, “It’s too bad
that the freshmen didn’t get to experience
the same sort of Court Selection night that
we did. Condiments have never tasted so
good.”

She went on to explain how Rusk plans
on preventing a similar problem in the
future, “Next year we're going to hide all
of our supplies in Warner until we’re
ready to use them.”

Turner is for rejects.”

Turner, traditionally rivals of Connor,
began the night in front of their house
when a large group of freshmen, led by
the Turner upperclassmen, began a re-
peated chant of “Connor sucks! Connor
sucks!” Connor members got revenge
when the Turner initiates went inside by
burning “Connor” into the front grass and
placing the camouflage Connor flag on
top of the Turner house. Turner made the
next move by putting laxatives in
Connor’s beer stash, while the members
of Connor kidnapped the Turner frog
mascot, Hopper.

Meanwhile, the always vicious Rusk/
Warner rivalry got off to a high-pitched
start when Rusk set up a trip wire outside
of the Warner house, sending the fresh-
men flying when they set up for the run
into the house. The Rusk women then
added Tabasco sauce to the Warner con-
diments, making the traditional condi-
ment dumping more uncomfortable for

the first years. Warner struck back in cre-
ative fashion, replacing Rusk’s DJ with a
Klezmer band.

Said Betty Lennox ‘06, “We were ex-
pecting to have a hip-hop party, but then
it turned into ‘Fiddler on the Roof.” The
Warner girls were also seen on the roof of
Rusk pouring an unidentified liquid, re-
portedly cow blood, on anyone trying to
get into the party. They also replaced
Rusk’s famous hot dogs with vegetarian
ones made of tofu.

As CoHo has no traditional rival, they
engaged in guerrilla-style warfare against
eating houses as well as fraternities. In
one prank, they tricked members of both
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Delta Theta.
According to CoHo member Peter Nox
06, “We told a group of SigEps who were
running from house to house in their un-
derwear to go into the Phi Delt house, be-
cause it was Warner. They got freaking
pummeled. A couple of them actually had
their noses broken. Man, that really
brought me back to the days when I was
pledging Kappa Sig.”

According to members of the adminis-
tration, over $50,000 of damage was
done by sunrise of the next day. The
money is expected to be raised by a com-
bination of increased PCC sticker fees and
possible house or individual fines.

But some see the damage as more than
monetary. Said Claire Thanes ’08, a new
member of Connor, “I used to be friends
with some of the girls in Turner. Not any-
more, because now I know that anyone
like me who lives and breathes Connor
can never associate with those losers in
Turner.”
