THE DA IAN

’Cat Golfers Undefeated
Netment Conquer West

Page Four

Although Davidson may not have a leading football team, the ‘Cats
stand high in all spring sports. Davidson sports turned upward when
the basketball team made the semi-finals of the Raleigh tournament,
being beaten by the winner. With the advent of spring, the 'Cats
swing into their own. Thus far the golf team has won five straight
over representative teams in the south on their annual tour, and the
tennis team has won all their matches which were reported before the
paper went to press. The only unreported match on the schedule for their
western trip is with the University of Texas, a fine team in any man’s
league. The baseballers got off to a flying start in two warm-up games
by beating Larkwood and Colby. The nine is still plenty rough in
spots, but this should improve with warmer weather and more practice.
Davidson's trackstars went down by a close decision to South Caro-
lina, the meeting being decided by the last event.

Saturday of this week will find all teams except frosh golf and
tennis having entered their regular schedule. This afternoon the ‘Cats
seek revenge for the 23-9 shellacking that Catawba handed them
last season on the diamond. Tomorrow the linksmen take on the
University of Georgia at Charlotte in their first home match. Fri-
day the frosh baseball team meets Greensboro High here while the
Varsity trackmen look for their first win when they meet Mary-
ville College here. At the same time the frosh take on Barium
Springs. Saturday brings Carolina to Davidson in another ball game,
while the frosh play Charlotte High there. It’s a full week for
players and spectators alike.

Diamond Dust

With baseball hitting full stride this week Coach Laird has been
working extensively with the entire squad in order to smooth things
Going around
the team, with a few notes here and there, here’s the way it looks
now. Behind the plate is Rusty Hellekson, ineligible reserve last year,
who has been showing up well defensively, and who has had two hits

out as much as possible before the season really starts.

Hurling duties are being taken care of

by seven men, three of whom have seen action already.

these Ficklen, Reinhardt, Connor, and Cagle are counted on for relief
duty. At the initial sack, Laird is working on Frank Niven, sophomore,
who garnered three for four in the Larkwood game, and is showing
improvement in his fielding. Black Dog has second in his clutches, being
a holdover from last with before him. Rusty
Edmundson and Walt Fitzgerald are waging a merry battle for the
shortstop slot, with Edmundson apparently on top at present. Fitzgerald
at
short consistently. Veteran Sam Hemphill has shown up well in hitting
thus far, having a brace of doubles and four singles to his credit now. He
will handle the hot corner this year.

In the outer gardens Hugh Verner, in left field, has been having
trouble at the plate, and at present is working on his hitting. Tub-
by Hand in center is batting third in the lineup, and besides slam-
ming out a homer in the Colby game, is fielding faultlessly. Eddie
Steere, senior right fielder, is the hard luck man of the outfit.
Counted on as a starting pitcher this season, he broke his arm last
fall in touch football, and will not be able to pitch at all this spring.
With the bases jammed ahead of him, and the score Colby 8, David-
son 6, Eddie cracked out a long ball to deep left field which fell
foul by a few inches out by the fence behind the left fielder. How-
ever he walked and Rutsy Hellekson took the hero’s role by scoring
a single which drove in the winning runs just before the third out was
made as Eddie (again) was caught slidding into third.

Intramurals Hit Stretch

Intramurals are now entering the last lap with one more major
sport remaining to be played after the present volleyball tournament is
over. During the year Pete Whittle and his referees, Alcorn, Cowan, and
Tice, have kept the whole program running smoothly with plenty of in-
terest shown by everyone. In the interfraternity competition the Phi
Gams are now leading, while the Seniors hold a big majority of points
in interclass competition. Competition for the individual intramural
trophy cup is centered between Bill Marquess and Steve Fowler, both
seniors, who have gathered 40 and 36 points respectively. Next high are
Tom Abbott and George Jones with 30 markers each. Jones however is
ineligible for any more intramural competition because of his varsity
tennis team position. Thus far competition for the cup has been much
stiffer than last year, for Yates Faison took the honor in '38 with a
36-point total. Congrats to Whittle for heightening interest in intra-
mural sports this year.

South Carolina Wins
Over Davidson Men

In a meet at Columbia last Sat-
urday Davidson's varsity tracksters
lost to the South Carolina Game-
cocks by the close score of 69 1-3
to 56 2-3.

Little of South Carolina was high
point man of the meet, chalking
up victories in four events—100-
yard dash, 220-yard dash, 220-low
hurdles, and the broad jump. Cap-
tain Larry Craig of the Gamecocks
was the individual star of the aft-
ernoon, however, bettering the rec-
ord in the discus with a throw of
148 feet 9 inches and showing up
superbly in the shot put and jave-
lin. Captdin Boo Walker led the
Wilcat cindermen with wins in the
mile and half-mile for 10 points.

Kit Trackmen

The Freshmen track team is rap-
idly rounding into shape for its
first meet which comes Friday,
April 7 with Barium Springs. The
Kittens are conceded a very good
chance the Barium
boys, who usually present a strong
aggregation.

In the weight departments. the
yearlings are especially strong, with
such men as Knoeller, Freeze, Bell,
Charlie Webb, and Terrell to do
the heaving. Probably the individ-
ual star of the team is Archie Tay-
lor from Winston-Salem who runs
the hurdles’ and sprints. Other
leading sprint candidates are Spen-
cer, Williams and Loy.

Distance Men

The distance runs will be taken
care of by the following: Cop-

During the annual spring tour
the Davidson golfers won all their
matches, defeating five opponents.

Thursday afternoon, the first day
of spring holidays, the Cat divot-
diggers met Hampton-Sydney at
Charlotte. Davidson won, 12 1-2 to
5 1-2. Granville Sharpe, football
star of Beester fame, divided the
low scoring honors with Jimmy
(Chicken) Cooper. They both held
8279;

Citadel was next to fall under the
scores of the Wildcat links-
men. The Citadel scored 3 1-2
points to the Cats 14 1-2. Again
Sharpe was low scorer with a 75.

Ray Pittman, captain of the
team, was next best with a 76.

Beat South Carolina

Davidson made it three straight
by defeating South Carolina, 9 1-2
to 8 1-2.

Emory was the next to succumb
to the Cats. This was another close

low

match, in which the Cats barely
squeezed out a 9 1-2 to 8 1-2 vic-
tory.

Finally, to celebrate the ending
of the spring vacation and also the
ending of a successful tour, the
golfers defeated the University of
Georgia, 13 to 5.

Yesterday afternoon, Alma Col-
lege of Michigan came to Charlotte
to meet the Davidson linksmen.
The match was played too late for
results to be placed in this issue,
however.

Kits Prep For
First Contest

With three weeks of preparation
behind them, interrupted only by
the spring vacation, the freshman
baseball team is rapidly rounding

into shape for the coming season.
Coach Norman Sheppard, disap-
pointed in the hitting of the yearl-
ings, spent a good part of last week
correcting faults in the batters. His
efforts were apparently in vain as
the Regulars were shut out for
four innings by Ed Lucas in the
practice game Monday. The Yan-
nigans pounded the offerings of
“Fireball” Chastain for three runs
and five hits. Among them were a
double by Jack Clark, a triple by
Bob McLeod, and a home run by
Jackie Simonds.
Infield Chosen

Coach Sheppard has just about
settled on the infield combination
which will bear the brunt of the
burden during the season, It con-
sists of Bill Nelson at third, Jim
Owens at short, Tommy Yarbor-
ough at second, and Bobby Carter
at first. In the few pre-season con-
tests which the team has had this
year this infield has shown good
promise.

Outfield Open

The battle for outfield positions
is still wide open. With Mac Morris,
Bob Smith trying for left field;
Sid Daffin and Cam Wilson for
center, and Frank Caldwell and
Ralph Stair for right, a fine group
of flychasers should be developed.

In preparation for games with
Greensboro and Charlotte on Fri-
day and Saturday, a practice tilt
will be held either Tuesday or Wed-
nesday with the varsity reserves.

Tennis Aces

Alternating at the number one
and two slots on the tennis team
are Rae Tenney of Atlanta, Ga.,
and Billy Turner of Chevy Chase,
Md. Tenney, a junior is playing
his second year as a member of
the varsity, besides a year with the
freshmen. Turner, sophomore star,
played at the first Pposition’on last
year’s frosh team. Traveling on the
western tour with the team, these
men played good tennis in all
matches on the trip. Both men are
ranked high among leading players
in colleges throughout the country.

Tennis Team Undefeated

On Spring Vacation Trip

With six matches of their holi-
day trip reported, the varsity ten-
nis team is still undefeated, hold-
ing victories over Univ. of South
Carolina, Emory, Southern Meth-
Southwestern, Baylor, and
Univ. of Mississippi.

In the opening match on March
23 the Wildcats defeated Emory in
a close match 6-4. On the 25th
downed a strong Univ. of
Mississippi by a score of 6-4. Turn-
er, Northcross, —Captain Jones,
Hunter, and Cloyd gained victories
in their singles matches, but Turn-
er and Tenney were the only Da-
vidson team to win in the doubles.

The Cats followed these up with
