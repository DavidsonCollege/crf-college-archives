Blade TI, We Were Soldiers are worth your time

By MicHAgEL GALDO

Staff Writer

Within a week I watched two movies that
covered the entire spectrum of American
cinema: We Were Soldiers and Blade 2. I
know, you’re probably thinking Blade 2?
Ok, that may be
a bit of an exag-
geration, but I’m
still not gonna
take it back.

Ihave seen We
Were Soldiers
twice already,
and it is quickly
becoming one of
my favorite war
movies. Based
on the true story
as told by Lieu-
tenant General
Harold G.
Moore (played
by Mel Gibson)
and civilian war
correspondent
Joseph L. Gallo-
way (portrayed
by a very talented Barry Pepper), the movie
tells the true story of the first major battle
between U.S. and Vietnamese forces in the
Vietnam War. The vivid. battle scenes with
their graphic and brutal portrayal of pain and
misery on the battlefield are nearly as grip-
ping as Black Hawk Down (another one of
my favorites). However, We Were Soldiers

Were Soldiers

does a better job at developing the characters
before sending them off to war. True, the
opening thirty five minutes can be a bit slow
and mildly cheesy at times, but when men start
to die on the battlefield one sees them more as
individual men, instead of a gear in the war
machine or as an unnamed “casualty.”

Another aspect of We Were Soldiers that
connects the audience with the characters is the
grizzled humor of veteran actor Sam Elliot. In
one scene a young sergeant walks past Sam
Elliot’s character and says “Good day sir.”
Elliot’s replies in a gruff tone, “How do you
know what kind of God Damn day it is?” Trust
me, it’s funny. Anyways, he says a few well-

timed grizzled, bitter lines throughout the.

film that reinforce the human quality of
men while at. war.
It does not matter
what the situation,
mankind has the
ability to express a
full range of emo-
tions no matter
what the situation.

Blade 2, on the
other hand, is the
continuing story of
a vampire-slaying
half-vampire born
with “all of their
strengths, but none
of their weak-
nesses.” Yes, it’s a
ridiculous premise,
but not.as ridicu-
lous as the script.
Sometimes I won-
der if the same per-
son writes every
action movie from
The Mummy to,
well, every Arnold
Schwarzenegger
movie ever made
(except, of course,
the brilliantly written Conan the Barbar-
ian 2). Well, this movie follows in this
tradition, with corny lines describing ev-
erything from bombs in people’s heads to
female anatomy.

Despite the fact that the movie con-

proval

tained three wrestling moves (including a Ma-
cho Man inspired flying elbow) Blade 2 gets the
Galdo stamp of approval. I mean, even without

Wesley Snipps and Blade I
get Galdo’s stamp of ap-

vampire powers and a 4-
foot-long silver sword,
Wesley Snipes is cool
enough to carry a movie.
O, and the intense fight
scenes and good cinema-
tography didn’t hurt. I en-
joyed this movie com-
pletely sober, although a
few might enhance your
movie going experience
(of course, I don’t recom-
mend drinking in the the-
ater out of one of those
giant cups they give you-
that would be
wrong).These two films
are completely different.
One ended with the death
of a vampire, the other with
the names and home states
of very real men who died
in the real battle you just
saw. You leave the theater
excited from Blade 2. You
leave the theater proud to
share a nation with men of
such courage from We

Were Soldiers. | don’t recommend seeing these
two movies in the same night. However, both
are a solid investment of your time, and your

five bucks.

Brian Grazer: “I found that my
calling was to tell stories as a pro-
ducer, and I just love doing just
that. In the case of A Beautiful
Mind, the story and the subject
were personal and important to
me. And to receive an award for
making this movie is a miracle.”
