THE DAVIDSONIAN
WEDNESDAY,
APRIL 27, 2005

The tennis team’s season came to an end
last weekend at the Southern Conference
tournament in Charleston. Davidson fell one
win short of the NCAA berth they have come
so close to obtaining in each of the last four
seasons. Since August, the team’s goal for
the season was clear.

“Our main goal was to win conference and
get to the postseason,” said assistant coach
Avi Kigel. A chance to play in the champi-
onship match at the SoCon tournament is a
great accomplishment, but the ’Cats had
done that already in 2003.

After wins over Wofford and the College
of Charleston, the Wildcats’ first-ever victo-
ry over the Cougars, the Davidson women
faced a Furman team on Sunday that narrow-
ly defeated them a week earlier. The ’Cats
fell short again by a 4-0 margin, though the
score did not reflect the closeness and emo-
tion of the final match.

As the second-seeded team in the tourna-
ment, Davidson received a bye into the quar-
terfinals where it squared off on Friday
against Wofford. Victories in two out of the
three doubles matches and routs at the sec-
ond, third and fifth singles positions earned
the ’Cats a routine 4-0 win over the Terriers

A late-game rally proved insufficient for
the baseball team last Wednesday as they lost
to in-state rival Duke with a score of 9-8. A
disappointing series against College of
Charleston, ranked 19th in the nation, fol-
lowed the loss.

and set up a Saturday morning match against
a Charleston team that has never lost to
Davidson. Earlier this season, the Cougars
beat the ’Cats 4-3.

Davidson came out strong in the doubles
matches to win at the top two positions,
which earned them the doubles point for the
10th straight match. Kelly Fillnow ’05 and
Meghan Fillnow ’05 snapped a three-match
losing streak with an 8-3 win at the top spot,
while Meggie Patterson 05 and Kelsey
Linville 08 won 8-4 at the number two posi-
tion for their 18th consecutive doubles victo-

ry.

“Winning the doubles point against
Charleston was huge,” said Linville. “The
Fillnows’ win really pumped us up.”

The ’Cats quickly stretched their 1-0 lead
to 3-0 with singles wins from Linville and
Meghan Fillnow. Linville cruised in her first
set at number three, and after struggling
through the first five games of the second
set, she eventually finished off her opponent
for the 6-1, 6-4 victory. Fillnow’s 6-3, 6-4
win at number four brought the Wildcats
within one match of victory.

Charleston made things interesting with
wins over Kelly Fillnow and Patterson, but
Kate Levitt ’07 clinched the match for
Davidson moments later with a 6-4, 6-3 win
at number five.

On Wednesday, the
Blue Devils took an early
lead in the second inning,
when they managed three
runs on four hits and two
walks. After a scoreless
third, Davidson reduced
the lead slightly when
Greg Zage ’07 hit a lead-
off home run to right field.

Zage again sparked the
offense in the sixth inning,
when his single led to
another run for the ’Cats,
who trailed just 3-2 after
Six innings. Duke
responded quickly, how-
ever, rallying for five runs
in the bottom of the sev-
enth inning and giving
themselves a comfortable
six-run lead.

The ’Cats rallied for six
runs in the top of the eighth, a run that final-
ly gave them a chance to take the game. It
began when Zage and Alex Entrekin ’06
both got into scoring position on walks. and
wild pitches, and Taylor Shoop ’06 stepped
in to pinch hit and promptly drove ina run.

Sam Navarro ’05 stepped to the plate and
singled to center to bring in Entrekin and
Shoop and reduce the lead to two runs. Next

Player of the Week

The 4-2 victory was the
’Cats’ first in 21 meetings
with the Cougars and vault-
ed Davidson into the cham-

pionship match against
Furman.
The match between

Davidson and Furman was
not just a battle of the con-
ference’s top two seeded
teams, but a battle between
two nationally-ranked
teams. The Wildcats and
Paladins were separated by
only two spots in the rank-
ings entering the champi-
onship, ranked 61 and 63,
respectively, and the match
reflected the tightness
between the two teams.
“We knew that the dou-
bles point might decide the
outcome of the match, as
we’re pretty even with them
in singles,” said Kigel.
After Sarah Borkowki ’05
and Kim Whelan ’08 posted
an 8-4 victory at number
three, Davidson needed

to the plate was Mike Muniz ’05, who dou-
bled down the right field line and brought
Navarro home. After a_ sacrifice bunt
advanced Muniz to third, Andrew Musashe
’05 hit a single up the middle.

Muniz scored and the ’Cats tied the score
8-8.

Justin Hartanov ’05 came to the mound to
close the game, and
although he succeed-
ed in throwing a per-
fect eighth inning, the
Wildcats were unable
to add any runs in the
eighth or ninth.

In the bottom of
the ninth, the Blue
Devil’s plated the
winning run and sent
Davidson home with
the loss.

The ’Cats bounced
back two days later as
they traveled to No.

the Southern
Conference-leading
Cougars. Unlike their
previous game,
Davidson got off to
an excellent start and

Jay Heafner ’06’s RBI single and a three
run double by Eli Benefield ’05 led the scor-

tom of the third, but in the top of the fourth
inning rain caused play to be suspended.
