An Honest Response —

It is with great sense of apprecia-
tion that we commend the faculty for
its action regarding the Vietnam Mor-
atorium.

Quite franklv it came as a surprise
to the vast majority of students. Al-
though many students had indicated
support of the war moratorium, few,
if anv. expected unified faculty sup-
port. for the effort.

The simple, two-sentence statement
isued by the faculty on Tuesdav pro-
vides a model of cooperation with the
students who have expressed grave
concern over the entire scope of our
activity in Vietnam.

~ The—faculty—has- opened . the- door—

to an honest confrontation on the
part of each Davidson student with
his own conscience and with the feel-
ings of others.

The major concern on the part of
many persons, however. is the respon:
se which the student body will give
to the moratorium.

There has-been considerable feel-
ing floating around which has given
rise to worry about the ever-present
nemesis. student apathy. and its ef-
fect on the serious efforts of a num-
ber of students and faculty members
who are altempling to bring an en-
hancement of awareness regarding
.JéTHain t6 Davidson.

the community to spread the confron-
tations The. Davidson committee has

as its only goal the desire to bring
more awareness and interest regarding
Vietnam to as many students as pos-
sible.

The achievement of that goal lies
in the willingness on the part of Da-
vidson students to be mature for one

but it is the honest concern of-a ma-

ders.

The moratorium provides the op
portunitv; it is-up to the students
to provide a mature response. If any
issue deserves some mature, well-di-

-rected thought, certainly this.one does.

Last week’s “New Republic’ pub-
lished .a front-page cditorial which
speaks to this point. The editors point-
ed out that the university is not ‘‘nor-
mally organized to function as a po-
litical institution.” but commented ,
that “the times. are abnormal” as a

result of the actions of our political

figures.

“We hope that every member of

torial concludes. “fronv the youngest

Of Community

For some time a large percentage
o: Davidson students and faculiv have
been looking for a -new sense of com-
munity, of common interest in the pur-
suit of relevance in education.

For the brief period Monday David-
son found its community.

Before students ran off to schedul-
ed labs and classes. and while parents
Were still on campus sharing in the
excitement of formal procession, Da-
vidson stopped the race tt has heen
running with itself for some time to
listen to a man sneak aboul something
that really mattered.

The first annual convocation. much
to the surprise of skeptical professors
and seniors, proved to be overwhelm-
ingly successful. Tt was a moment
“svmbolic of academic renewal.”

Dr. Samuel D. Proctor. in his role
as the initiator of that renewal. was
perfectly cast. A man of keen intelli-
gence, he summed up in short mea-
sure what admissions personnel, stu-
dents and faculty alike have been
trying to say for a long time.

His analysis of the crisis in educa-
tion for the black student and his
admonition for the college in respect.”

to its responsibility in that area could
not have been delivered to a better
audience at a beiter time. +

His cal for an environment which_

would allow-even a knotted pine io
grow should serve as a guideline to

be followed as we consider the ques
tion of admissions and recruiting of
the poor white and the poor black.

The convocation commiltee is to he
commended for its success in adminis-
tering the convocation in a manner
verv suited for the academic commun-
itv. which admissions nfaterial makes
Davidson appear to be.

But the success of the convocation
reats..primariy on Proctor—himself-
on his wit, on his ‘talent both as a
writer and an brator and on his sense
of timing.

His message and the sense of ur-
gency which it carried should provide
Davidson with a needed impetus to
maintain the community which it
shared for an hour Monday,

Working aS a community in
thorough pursuit of responsibility in
our response to Proctor’s call, we
may also stumble on that relevance
for which we so desparately search..

Last Summer

Davidson's summer school 1969 en-

rolled 56 students first session and -

51 second session. |’

Without knowledge of what part of
this meager number attended both
sessions, it still appears fair to con-
clude that the college should either
do something with the summer school
or be rid of it.

The easier course would be to aban-
don the summertime stepchild: but
we are reluctant to encourage ahban-
donment of what could be of mutual
benefit to college and__individuals
alike.

Davidson has a physical plant and
location particularly suited to summer-
time study and recreation. A pool
ahd tennis courts are complemented
by the Like Camous offerings of
boating and swimming.

Academic buildings are air condi-

tioned and at least some rooms of
the library are air-conditioned.
. We have one air conditioned dorm
and othei's could he so equipped with
the expense for the air conditioning
borne by summer room rent. (Rent
presently uncollected as the dorms
stand empty for three months.)

One of the longstanding abuses of
American education has been its vir-
tual abandonment of expensive -faeil-
ities for one quarter of the calendar

year.

It is to Davidson's credit that such
programs as the Liberal Arts Program
for Teachers and the Project Oppor-
tunity program for high school stu-
dents have been held here during the
summer months. But there is room
for much more activity here: more
church conferences could use the
Davidson facilities, even business and
professional groups — often seeking
some protection from the intrusions
and distractions of the city — could
make use of the campus. In addition,
in the past such arrangements have
often held long term. benefits for the
college. .

These possibilities notwithstanding.
we suggest that the summer school
itse!f be given first priority.

Further, we propose that one dorm

+e set aside for women matriculants.
(Women students here in the past were
afforded no opportunity for college
housing.)
—dInformation about the summer pro-
gram would have.to be disseminated
among coed universities and women’s.
colleges across the Southwest.

Davidson could go coed next sum-
mer with little on no capital expense
and no change in present facilities or
faculty — except that both would be
to better use. Which they should be.

There are no needles in: the haystacks.

A divided Germany, Arab-Israeli open warfare, ,
the Sino-Soviet border clashes — students of inter-
national politics warn against hopes for real solutions.

Most have come to regard Vietnam in the same
perspective — a long, recurring nightmare that’s
always there. in the morning.

Dr. Pail S. Crane recognizes these insomnious
symptoms of the United States but sees the causes
and the cure differently from many of this country’s

insomniacs.

“Y think that history will be where the wisdom
of this nation’s policy will be recognized,” speculated
Crane after Monday’s convocation, at which he re-
ceived an honorary degree for his efforts as a medi-

cal missionary in Korea.

“Even to the loss of American lives over there.
I think: you will be proud ten years from now that
the United States did what it did — and that it did
so because ‘nobodies’, people who had-no power to
wield, who were being killed in the night.”

“a

Once.the game_is.started terrible things hap-

pen,” added Crane. “But you have to look at who
kicked the first ball.” Crane has more than a nodding
acquaintance with war in the far east. He headed’ a
medical support team for guerillas in Korea in 1947.

Recalling the Korean War, Crane said that Japan

and not South Korea,
down the peninsula.

was the object of the drive

Japan is still Communist China's first objective,

said Crane.

But threat or no threat, the Republic of South
Korea has functioned quite well by many standards.
Continuing border skirmishes have not prevented
achievement-of a-high annual growth rate — reaching

14 percent in 1968.

More importantly, perhaps. if Crane's analysis is
correct, is the change in attitude of the young men

and women of._Korea.

“There was rioting in Seoul today.” commented
Crane in response to a question about the current

political situation in Korea.

“The young people have assimilated the values
of a democratic society. For four thousand vears the
Koreans have lived under authoritarian rule. Now

breath of fresh air.”

, they have a chance for something else: It’s like a

. The rioting was part’ of a crisis that has been
brewing since July when President Park Chung-hee
called for a vote of confidence through a constitu.
tional amendment bill that would allow the president

to serve a third term-

The rioting students are a part of this opposition
— With their paramount objective the establishment
of a tradition of peaceful transition of power. long
considered essential to a truly democratic system.

“After one devastating war, two revolutions, five
constitutional amendments . . . the opposition insists
the Park government should give South Korean
democracy a chance to mature, to take root,” says

Crane.

While we have of recent vears talked authorita--
tively on “the oriental mind” and how we shouldn't
ing needs of Davidson stu-- be so ethnocentric as to force our own brand’ of
democracy on that mind, perhaps we should have
factored in the old saw “never underestimate the

power of youth.”

And as we move toward October 15 .we should
be hoping that in a few years the students will be
rioting in Saigon for the same things they were

rioting for in Dr. Crane’s Korea last Monday.
