Storage Warehouse
To Be Constructed

New Building Between East
‘and Laundry
By Kent Christopher

That new building construction
blocking the path between East and
the laundry is to be additional
warehouse and’storage facilities for
the college and not garages for stu=
dent limousines as was hopefully
rumored last week.

This new warehouse is being con-
strueted as a government project
from its surplus material. The J.
A. Jones Construction Company of
Charlotte, who recently completed
an addition to the laundry plant and
construction of the cardboard vil-
lage here, is doing the work.

Large piles of prefabricated
panels which have been trucked in
and obstruct the parking qrea ad-
jacent to the R, O. T. C. build-
ing are salvaged sides of former

barracks and warehouses of the
Greenville, S. C., Army Air Base.
They are only a part of the ma-
terial to come and the remainder
is expected to come from Tulla-
homa, Tenn. Yet, it will be neces-
sary to construct a ‘new front end
for the building.

Dimensions of the main part of
the building which will rise from
its concrete block foundation ap-
proximately ten feet above the
level of Stud Store Boulevard, are
125 feet long by about 25 feet wide.

Completion of the structure jis
expected tobe accomplished — in
about four weeks. It was expected
by W. G. Clany of Mooresville,
project superintendent, that neces-
sary masonry and a surface water
drainage ditch at the east end would
be finished by the end of this
week.

The government projected the
new building at Davidson after an
investigation revealed the fact that
there was an urgent need for stor-
age facilities here. When the Stud
Store was enlarged last fall it took
up the college’s warehouse space
and made it necessary to store un-
used furniture and supplies a mile
north of Davidson in a barn on the
farre of Sgt. Burton, R. O. T. C.

instructor, according to Mr. F. L.
Jackson, college treasurer.
Mr. Jackson went on to state

that the college was very grateful
to the government for .the benefi-
cent service rendered through gifts
of various articles or sale of such
at nominal costs.

with Davidson again host for the
March 1 gathering. A minimum of

In a recent meeting of the Fresh-
man Court of Control, seven par-
ticularly wretched members of the
Class of 50 were given fair trial
and sentenced in accordance with
their just desserts, for violation of
many of the which
through the years have kept the
hallowed walls of Davidson sacro-

traditions

sanct,

Just prior to opening of the court
session, George Ennett, scribe of
the state-
ment to of the
Davidsonian present, issued a stern

court, in an exclusive

representatives

warning to freshmen who, taking
advantage of a period of recupera-
tion deemed necessary following
examinations, have begun with pro-

fligate abandon to ignore the fresh-
man traditions which through the
years have kept the sacrosanct walls
of Davidson hollowed. Especially
emphasized in the court statemént
were the misdemeanors of leaving
chapel seats before all Seniors have
left the auditorium and refusal to
wear regulation freshman caps; as
well as the henious crime of sleep-
ing through chapel.

First defendant of the session
was George McKee,’ who was
charged with being most discourt-
eous toe both upperclassmen and
freshmen in the student store and
Hbout the campus. McKee was
reprimanded severely by Judge
John McAllister, who cited the case
of Cailliet vs. Otts, 49 Territory of
Alaska 250 (1850); and was sen-
tenced to write a 2,000-word paper
on common courtesy.

Judge Expounds

In an exclusive statement to rep-
resentatives of the Davidsonian
present, Judge McAllister said,
“The court feels that it was justified
in being most lenient upon this cul-
prit despite the grave misdemeanor
which he committed. In the 110
years of Davidson’s traditional ex-
istence, such__reprehensible ‘ acts
have not been tolerated from mem-
bers of the freshman class. Very
strict and stern punishments have
been the rule; however, this year
members of the court feel that con-
structive punishment is of more
value to freshmen involved as well
as to*the traditional spirit of good
will that exists within the hallowed
walls-of old Davidson: Brother, for
the next offense, times will be
tough all over.”

Freshman Jake Wade was hailed
before the court on the charge of
excessive exhibitionism on the ath-
letic field, an attitude not consider-

spirit of sportsmanship that exists
within the sacred walls of hallowed
Davidson. Wade was acquitted on
the grounds that no exhibition has
been possible for members of the

Improvemen ts

February 19 was the date of the
semi-annual meeting of the Board
of Trustees. Dr. J. McDowell Rich-
ards, President of Columbia Theo-
logical Seminary. Decatur, Ga.,
presided.

Reports were made the preceding
day by the Grounds and Building
Committee on the landscaping of
the campus, the construction of the
new Gymnasium and the new
Chureh, and on the providing of
more clearly defined parking areas
about the campus. This commit-
tee is composed of Messrs. J. A.
Cannon, of Concord, S. Clay Wil-
liams, of Winston-Salem, and Dr.
Hamilton McKay, of Charlotte.

Other -matters—which also re-
ceived the attention of the Trustees
were tuition charges for next year,
salaries of faculty members, furth-
er enlargement of the faculty, and
enrollment policies. Consideration
was given to a financial campaign
to add to the funds which were
raised three years ago for the new
Gymnasium and the new Church,
and for additional endowment funds.

There are fifty Trustees, elected
by the nine Presbyteries of North

Florida, and by the Alumni Associa-
tion. About forty were in attend-

Concert Band

DAVIDSON, Feb. 13. Plans
were completed here last week for a
Southern tour by the Davidson Col-
lege Concert Band this week which
includes concerts in Florence, S. C.,
Atlanta, Thomasville and Waycross,

| Ga., and Newton, N. C.

James Christian Pfohl, Director
of Music, who made the announce-
mént of the tour, conducted all four
concerts.

The fifty piece organization
which has been called “The South’s
Finest College Band,” resumed the
Southern Tour this year after war
time travel difficulties forced can-
cellation of the trip in every year
since 1942.

Melvin Sipe, 22 year old sopho-
more from Lincolnton, N. C., was
the featured soloist in all four of
the concerts. A veteran of three
years of Navy service, including
performances with Admiral
Nimitz’s personal orchestra, Sipe
performed on the violin. He has
received instructions in the instru-
ment since he was seven years old
and was a member of the Davidson
band before the war. He is also a
member of the Charlotte Symphony
Orchestra. :
