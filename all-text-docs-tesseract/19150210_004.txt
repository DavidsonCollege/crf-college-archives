The

SPRING GOLF TOURNAMENT.|FINE LYCEUM ATTRACTION

With the near approach of spring

there arises in the breasts of all a desire
to get out of doors, and this call or de-
sire comes to no one so strongly as it
comes to the golfer. Hence the young
but fast improving Davidson course is
every afternoon crowded with the lovers
of golf. ‘The interest in the game here
is increased, however, by other causes
than the excellent weather conditions of
the past few days. One of these is the
approach of the time for the spring tour-
nament. It will be remembered that
the winter tournament had to be post-
poned on account of the unfavorable
weather conditions. The club is, how-
ever, making definite arrangements for
a spring tournament. Yet, since the
new holes will not be complete until
about April 1, it was thought best to
ostpone the tournament until near the
atter part of April or the 1st of May.
The addition of the new holes will be a
vast improvement and the additional
time will give the golfers opportunity to
recover from the lack of practice during
the winter.

At a meeting of the club on Thurs-
day of last week it was decided to al-
low students to join the club for three
dollars for the rest of the term. The
rule of five dollars as membership fee
will not go into effect until next year.

INTERESTING Y. M.C. A.
MEETING HELD

Last Thursday night an unusually in-
teresting Y. M. C. A. meeting was held.
The first of a series of Life Work meet-
ings was led by Messrs. Roy Perry and
L. A. Mullen. In short, snappy talks
these men showed clearly how the pro-
fession of law needs upright, Christian
men to help raise the standard of law as
well as other professions.

It is very interesting to hear men up-
hold the profession which they have
chosen as their life work, and it is hoped
that large audiences will greet the next
speakers.

CAMPUS NOTES.

“Ed” Carter, who was successfully
operated on for appendicitis at St. Leo's
Hospital, Greensboro, is expected to re-
turn to college within the next few days.

G. Somerville has left for his
home in Virginia on account of illness.
Before returning to Davidson he will
attend the Mott mectings at Chapel
Hill. Somerville was recently elected
president of the local Association for
1915-16.

Tom Misenheimer is still confined at
his home in Charlotte, but his condition
is much improved and it is hoped he
will soon be able to return to the Hill.

DEATH OF DR. R. F. SMITH.

The Davidson Student Body learned
with deep sorrow of the death of Dr. R.
F. Smith, of Easley, S. C., on last Fri-
day afternoon.

Dr. Smith was the father of Frank
Smith, of the Junior class. Announce-
ment of the serious illness of Dr. Smith
was communicated to his son only a few
days before his death. Promptly upon
receipt of this word he left for his home.
Dr. Smith’s illness, which was caused
by pneumonia. was of short duration and
everv effort in his behalf was of no
avail,

As a mark of respect to him the busi-
ness establishments of Easlev closed dur-
ing the afternoon of the funeral. and
the students of the public schools at-
tended in a body, the schools also being
closed.

Dr. Smith was prominent in the life
of his home city. being president of the
Easley Loan & Trust Company, presi-
dent of the Easley Oil Mill, owner of
the R. F. Smith Drug Company, and
a director in several of the other enter-
prises of that and other towns of the
county. .

The svmpathy of the entire college
student body goes out to his family in
their bereavement and great loss, and es-
peciall yto his sons, who have taken such
an active and prominent part in the
student life of Davidson.

LAST FRIDAY NIGHT

A military spirit, not as comprehen-
sive and as dangerous, however, as that
which is so much in evidence among the
warring European nations, gripped a
large and appreciative audience of Dav-
idson students last Friday night as they
watched the excellent performance of
the “Military Girls.” From the time
that they appeared on the stage as a
drum corps with the martial air and
step of a soldier regiment until they
rendered the closing number, “Dixie,”
on the orchestra, there was not a lull in
the performance.

Orchestra selections, humorous songs,
violin solos, and readings, constituted
the greater part of the evening’s pro-
gram. It is a universal verdict that the
orchestra selections of the evening would
measure up to any ever given at Lyceum
attractions at Davidson. The humorous
songs, in which each of the six leading
characters in turn took a part, were gen-
erously applauded.

The support given to this entertain-
ment by the student body will make it
possible for the manager of the Lyceum
Course to give at least two more at-
tractions this spring. The next num-
ber, a witty, humorous entertainment by
a skillful cartoonist, will be given, if at
all possible, during Junior Speaking.

TWO SERIES OF
ADDRESSES PLANNED

The Y. M. C. A. announces two very
interesting scries of addresses for the

DAY OF PRAYER ‘TO BE
OBSERVED AT DAVIDSON

The day of prayer for American
schools and colleges will be observed at
Davidson, Sundav, February 28. Dr.
Richards has invited Rev. R. T. Coit,
a Davidson alumnus and missionary to
Korea, to speak at the evening service
that day. Mr. Coit was one of the lead-
ing men of the college when he was
here, being prominent in every activity
and one of the most popular men among
his fellow students that has ever been

ere,

The Y. M. C. A. is endeavoring to
secure a speaker for two vesper services
on the Friday and Saturday preceding
this Sunday.
