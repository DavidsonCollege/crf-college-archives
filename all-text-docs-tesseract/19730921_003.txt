Barber Designates Cast
For Shakespeare Play

By DAVID RICHARDSON
Staff Writer

The Drama Department
recently completed auditions for
‘“‘A Midsummer __ Night’s
Dream,” its first production of
the 1973-74 season.

Rupert T. Barber Jr., direc-
tor of the play, expressed his
satisfaction with the
auditioners. ‘I was greatly
pleased with the turnout,” he
said, although he showed some
disappointment over the small
number of girls present. There
were 10 coeds out of 50 students
that appeared to audition.

“I cast less than 50 percent of
the students,” Barber stated.
He explained this as the result
of the lack of time and staff
members.

Work committees involving
the cast have already been
designated, according to Bar-
ber. Presently, there are 19 cast
roles. A complete cast of 25
students is expected to be
reached in the near future.

Barber explained that out of
the 19 cast roles, 11 were taken
by students new to the Drama
Department and five of these
were coeds. There are no town-
speople in the cast.

The successfully cast students
with previous experience in
the Drama Department are

" proposed

Set production for ‘‘A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream” is
progressing under the direction
of Mike Ramsey. Barber an-
nounced that a new stage would
be built for the play.

“The core of the lab work is to
be done by Drama 21 class,” he
said, although adding that ‘we
are in the throes of production
looking for people with special
talents.”’

presently operating on the
campuses of Duke, Wake
Forest, St. Andrews, and
Davidson, with state offices in
Durham.

Modeled on suggestions by
consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, NC PIRG allows
students to maintain a full-time
voice on issues affecting the
lives of North Carolina citizens,
especially in areas of research,
investigation, and action on
problems of pollution, health
care, consumer protection, and
race discrimination.

NC PIRG is funded through
$3 contributions from each
student on the participating
campuses. Each student has the
opportunity’ to withdraw his
support from PIRG_ by

ing a refund of the $3, a
renea of the college
comprehensive fee.

Director of the Davidson

Chapter of NC PIRG, Andy
‘Lamas, indicated that ‘the re-
fund process at Davidson willbe
in ect during the fourth week

“The refunding will be

properly advertised,’ Lamas
explained.

‘“‘We hope the Davidson PIRG
will be a loose organization
where individual students will
solicit funds from the state
PIRG by filling out forms
available in the Extended
Studies office,’’ he said.

“‘NC PIRG has a bad taste in
everybody’s mouth because of
the funding method,’’ said
Lamas. ‘‘We’re seeking ways to
change the method of funding
next year.

“Funds are most available,

and it is my hope that all the
money put into PIRG by
Davidson students will return
through individual and group
projects,’ Lamas noted.

The Davidson’ chapter
director expressed interest in
seeing Davidson students make
use of the Extended Studies
program in order to carry out
extensive projects they might
have in mind..

Ina meeting here at Davidson
Saturday, leaders from other
PIRG chapters in the state
hopes of making a
broader base for PIRG by

i

getting the state schools
involved.
“The Davidson Chapter of
PIRG exists for persons having
jects which will require a

of interest arises, we'll supply
the necessary manpower to see
it through.”

PIRG will make their refund
offer good this week. Those
students who went to collect
their $3 refund rather than sup-
port NC PIRG should see the
Comptroller during the up-
coming week.

PIRG projects currently
scheduled at Davidson for 1973-
74 include taking part in a
statewide prescription drug
survey, doing a bank interest
survey, investigating unfair
advertising by automobile
salesmen, studying conditions
in the federally funded housing
projects in Charlotte, and doing
research for a coastal land use
project.

Lamas emphasized that the
program was _ sufficiently
flexible to give help to any
student with an individual
project.

The faculty had urged speedy
consideration of the Faculty
Constitution, deemed to be the
fullest expression of faculty
opinion on governance, while
agreement was reached that
the faculty does not expect the
committee to make a final
decision on approval of their
Constitution.

In discussion of the Faculty
Constitution general consensus
determined that the President
should remain the presiding of-
ficer and that it might be
desirable for the faculty to elect
a non-presiding faculty chair-
man to serve aS a com-

The administration expressed
concern over this office as
having potential adverse effects
on educational policy and an
overall decisive impact.

The committee heard a
revision of the

Educational Policy Committee

(EPC) assuming primary
faculty responsibility, and
agreed that student par-
ticipation on the EPC is
working well.

Strong student interest in the
operating budget was voiced.
and the committee agreed to

divide the present Budget,

mittee into two: a Budget com-
mittee and Buildings and

asked to submit an alternative
model, Model II also for
