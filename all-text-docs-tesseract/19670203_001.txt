SYMPOSIUM INITIATED

Hawkins Analyzes LSD Effects

By JIM COOLEY
Stett Writer

Dr. David Hawkins. a psy-
chiatrist and faculty member
of the University of North Car-
olina Medical School, initiat-
ed a second semester LSD
symposium sponsored by the
College Union and the YMCA
in a chapel address to the stu-
dent body Monday on the his-
tory. effects, and dangers of
the controversial drug.

Hawkins traced the develop-
ment of the drug directly to
experiments by a young Swiss
investigator. Dr. Albert Hoff-
man, in 1943.

After publication of his re-
sults four years later, research
was stepped up: but before
elaborating on the rather
alarming aspects of this re-
search, Hawkins turned to a
consideration of the drug and
its effects.

He described LSD as a taste-
less, odorless, colorless deriva-

tive of a fungus which, taken
in very minute quantities (75-
100 micrograms), can produce
profound effects from eight to
24 hours. Few other drugs
work in as small a quantity
as LSD, yet there is ‘“‘very
littie physiological effect,’ he
noted.

The common adjective used
to classify LSD is ‘“‘psyche-
delic’’ which Hawkins trans-
lated from the Greek as
“mind-manifesting.”” LSD ac-
tually changes the function of
the mind in a manner similar
to alcohol and opiates, he ex-
plained, but it lacks the linger-
ing effects which the latter
produce.

Hawkins admitted that there
are several problems in try-
ing to describe what it is like
to take a ‘‘trip.*” Sense im-
pressions are so vivid and un-
usual that a proper vocabulary
does not exist to describe the
experience.

Another problem results
from the fact that the drug af-
fects different people in dif-
ferent ways and even the same
person experiences various ef-
fects when he takes the drug
at different times.

A person's ‘‘psychological
make-up” at the time of tak-
ing LSD. and, even more im-
portantly, the setting in which
the drug is taken alter the
drug's effects:

LSD is obtained in the form
of a pill; however. illegal dis-
tribution of it is usually in an
aqueous solution which is
placed upon a sugar cube.

Approximately 30 minutes
after taking the drug. lights
become bright and seem to
shimmer. Hawkins described
the changes in_ perception
which take place through the
use of a rug which seemed to
increase in depth and to ex-
hibit beautiful, brightly-colored
patterns upon its surface.

Laughter and uncontrollable
giggling are symptomatic of
the user's extreme happiness
during the trip, but these peri-
ods of happiness can be fol-
lowed by other periods of deep
depression.

A sense of empathy and of
thinking that one knows the
answer to everything leads the
user to what Hawkins termed
“the transcendental moment
of oneness with the universe”
or which has also been called
“the clear white light."

The LSD trip can be a ter-
rifying experience. Hawkins
commented, with the periods
of happiness followed by de-
pression. The subject should
never be left alone while un-
der the influence of the drug.

“It is an interesting, in-
tense experience for some.”
he concluded, ‘‘but for others
it is sheer hell."

Again considering the re-
search which has been carried

out recently. Hawkins outlined
four areas in which LSD has
potential importance.

It can be very important in
research on mental illnesses,
specifically by mimicking cer-
tain aspects of those ilinesses,
and it can be used for the
training of mental health work-
ers by giving them some idea
of the distortions experienced
by schizophrenics.

itawkins indicated that LSD
could also have significant
therapeutic value. particular-
ly among chronic alcoholics.

The fourth possible value of
LSD was in providing what
Hawkins called a ‘‘new relig-
ion’ through an ‘‘expanding
of the consciousness.’’

Though neither agreeing or
disagreeing with the LSD
oriented religious movement
headed by Timothy Leary and
Richard Albert, he admitted
that no new moral or ethical
system nor a new philosoph-

ical outlook has yet appeared
from this movement.

Three dangers were outlined
by Hawkins which have arisen
from the casual use of LSD.
The danger which is present
while actually taking the drug
is that of poor judgment and
the resulting fear, terror and
motivation to self destruction
which has already caused a
death at Chapel Hill.

Hawkins expressed the opin-
ion that most users of LSD
are above average. often ar
tistically inclined. young peo
ple from upper middle-class
grounds.

He accounted for their turn
ing to the drug as a desire to
break away into new experi-
ences beyond those offered by
the middle class.

The question which must be
asked, explored and faced by
young people today, according
to Hawkins, is “Is this trip
really necessary?”

New Library Site Proposed

By BOB DUNHAM
Staff Writer

The area between the College
Union and Duke Dormitory has
been added to the growing list
of possible sites of the proposed
new library building.

The site was proposed by J.
Russell Bailey, an architect from
Orange, Va.. who visited the
campus Wednesday to look over
the campus and evaluate pos-
sible locations.

The Guest House site, which
had appeared to be heading the
list as the most likely candidate,
was felt by Bailey to be too
small; he felt that the library
would be cramped in the area.

He also rejected the idea of
making additions to the present

David Fisher (R) beams as he and Terry Eastercamp (back

library, as an alternative to
building a new library.

The Virginia architect pointed
out that the College Union-Duke
site had the advantage of ade-
quate space, since the road pass-
ing through the area could eas-
ily be moved eastward toward
the stadium.

Another advantage, he said,
would be its convenience both to
the academic area. that is,
Chambers, and the living areas
of the dormitories.

A generally accepted theory,
he said, is that a college library
should ideally be located con-
veniently to the academic area.
as opposed to the living area,
the justification being that stu-
dents have less free time dur-

ing the daylight hours than at
night, and the time lost in get-
ting to the Nbrary would conse-
quently be more significant in
going from the academic areas.

The possibility of a coordi-
nate women’s college being built
to the north of the existing cam-
pus has made the Guest House
location attractive. as well as
the convenience to the dormi-
tories.

Another proposal, that the 1i-
brary be erected where Lingle
Manor now stands, would also
be convenient to a girls’ campus.

Bailey returned to Virginia
this week.to review all the sug-
gested locations and to study
preliminary sketches of the li-
brary. He will send an evalua-

tion and recommendations to the
Library Committee sometime
next week.

Once his letter has been re-
ceived, the committee will be-
‘gin to evaluate the recommen-
dations of the experts who have
been consulted.

The committee has already
heard from Charles F. Gillette,
the college's landscape archi-
tect, and Keyes D. Metcalf, re-
tired director of the Harvard
library, who is considered the
leading authority on library
planning.

No final decision on where to
place the library is expected
until next fall.

student was safely placed into
an automobile.

According to his report, Car-
tiker then conducted a routine
investigation of White's room to
find out how the situation had
developed.

White’s roommate Bill Bar-
nette who was on the scene at:
the time of the incident reported
that he did not remember that
the officer had stayed to help
the injured student.

Gresh Bayne in a letter to
THE DAVIDSONIAN expressed
indignation over Carriker's ap-
parent lack of concern for the
student and chided the officer
for seeking to find drinking as
the cause for the injury.

Because both White and Bar-
nette are members of a social
fraternity which recently re-
ceived a friendly warning about
the dangers of drinking in the
fraternity house as a result of
a check made by Carriker, the
administration has investigated
the possibility of a connection
between that incident and Car-
riker's claim of misrepresenta-
tion in the White incident.

The investigation has failed to
turn up any substantial support
for this theory according to an
administration source.

VMiatthews Questions
Rusk About Vietnam

Basic War Queries

Find No

Answers

“Our basic questions about the December and January.

Vietnam war weren't really an-
swered,"’ said Chuck Matthews,
Davidson student body president,

‘| about the conference with Secre-

tary of State Dean Rusk that he
attended with 45 other college
student leaders.

Matthews said that the group
was impressed with Rusk’s ‘‘ob-
vious integrity and honesty,”
but that “it appeared to us that
the U.S. was too much commit-
ted to a military solution in Viet-
ham and not willing to take
enough steps to lead to negotia-
tions any time soon.”

A RESPONSE

The meeting was a response
to a letter to President Johnson
signed by 200 student leaders in

J
?

In replying ‘for the President.
Rusk invited the group to come
to Washington and meet with
him.

Matthews paid his own ex. —
penses, and was not acting for
the Davidson Student Council.

The group, witch included rep.
resentatives from UNC, UCLA,
Harvard and others, met with
Rusk two hours Tuesday after
noon.

COMMITTEE

A new steering committee was
formed by those attending the
conference in order to reply to
what Rusk said.

Another letter is to be circu.
lated to the original 200. This
letter witl hopefully produce a
conference with the President
himself, since it is the President
who makes policy.

The questioning of Rusk cen-
tered around the broad aspects
of the war. rather than specific
issues.

It was the feeling of the group.
said Matthews, that “‘the divi-
dends to our national interest
from a military victory would
not be worth the cost."

ORIGINAL LETTER

The original letter questioned
what it called ‘‘apparent contra-
dictions in the American position
on efforts to negotiate a settle-
ment.”

In addition, the devastation of
the countryside of both North
and South Vietnam and the risk
of America's vital interests were
criticized.

The letter and its results have
represented the more moderate
student questioning of the war.
and arose in a split with those
in the National Student Associa-
tion who favored civil disobedi-
ence and demonstrations as the
way to voice their dissatisfac-
tion.

When Rusk replied to the let-

' ter, a steering committee was

THE WRATH OF GOD?

last spring, no change seems to have been noticed in the
student body. The College Presbyterian Church seems not to
have fared so well, however. THE DAVIDSONIAN was not
able to determine whether the church had been struck by the
wrath of God or whether the damage was caused by the high
winds of the past weekend. (Staff Photo by Olson)

formed. of which Matthews was
a member, to try to arrange a
conference and draft a reply to
Rusk’s.

SECOND LETTER

The second letter is expected
to be in the hands of the orig-
inal 200 by the end of next week.

It will be sent to the President
“with the hope that it will open
up a dialogue with the President
as it did with the secretary of
state last time."’ said Matthews.

Matthews emphasized that
Rusk was cordial and ‘very
generous with his time.’
