challenged Furman in what
Gray Gilchrist called a “gradge
match. Furman beat us last
year and their coach used to
‘came to head the Davidson
team.” *

The Cats met the challenge
and beat Furman by a score of ”
2-0. Kirk Cameron and Cathy
Inabnet provided the needed
goals in a well- played team
effort. x

Last Friday, the squad faced
Converse with some nervous
apprehensions. Injuries had
brought the team down to the
minimum of eleven players,
leaving no available substi-
tutes.

In spite of such an unfortu-
nate situation, the team banded

bout with the goalie. :

Tuesday brought Appala- | ~

chian to Davidson and judging
from the game statistics of both

among all the players was high
as co-captain Ann Clark admit-
ted prior to the game, “I’ve
been psyched for two months to
play them.”

At the start’ of the game, the
team all toasted the seniors as
this was their last game of the
regular season. Red roses were
given to co-captain Kirk Came-
ron, Jamie Watt, Lea Pitten-
ger, and Margaret Herman.

This type.of excitement held
up through the entire game.
Previous game records showed
that Appalachian had lost in
overtime to Chapel Hill by 1-0
while Chapel Hill had beat
Davidson 4-0. Yet the Cats
played their best game of the
season yesterday in a 1-0 loss to
Appalachian. The match was
solid proof of their continual
improvement since the Chapel
Hill game.

The first half was closely-
played between both teams.
During most of the second half,
however, Davidson came back
stronger and aggressive to do-

minate the game with out:

offense keeping the ball on the
attack. Although the team fi-
nally allowed Appalachian a
goal, the players were proud of
the way they had played.
Perhaps the most notable
aspect of the Appalachian game
was not directly on the field,

but on the sidelines. This game

Guilford stuns sleeping Cats

By BERT MOBLEY
Staff Writer

Davidson’s middle guard
Svend Pedersen summed up
last Saturday’s Guilford game
very well: “Guilford really came
at us. But we played ‘poorly.
The defense played very poorly.
We weren’t ready and they
were.” .

Over-confidence was a pro-
blem for the Wildcats in the
Lion’s Club Charity game.
Comparative scores indicated
that Davidson would win handi-
ly over the Guilford Quakers.
Davidson had beaten Randolph-
Macon 42-0 and Guilford lost to
Randolph-Macon 27-0.

After Saturday night’s game,
the scoreboard was lit up with
an entirely different story. Guil-
ford won 42-35.

This week the. Wildcats will
be going into the Furman game
at Greenville, S.C., as an
underdog. This game is possib-

year.

Davidson Coach Ed Farrell
lauded this week’s opponent by
saying, ‘‘They (the Furman
Paladins) have a good balance
of offense and defense. Their
running game is a good, steady
one and:they also pass the ball
well. They are not flashy but are
very basic and sound.”’

Before the season began,
Lehigh and Furman were seen
as the toughest’ games~of the
season. Davidson staged a furi-
ous comeback a few weeks ago
against Lehigh but failed to
come up with the last second
touchdown that would have
won the game. Davidson
dropped that game by. a score of
27-21.

The Bucknell Bisons were
also seen as one of. the year’s
best opponents. Davidson also
lost that, one in the closing
seconds at Richardson Field by
a 21-20 score.

Ironically, the 'Cats have
played their toughest oppo-
nents enthusiastically and lost
by close margins while losing
some of the ones they were
supposed to win,

The Wildcats will need a very
enthusiastic effort Saturday as

- they play Furman for the first

time since 1973. The Paladins
lead the series 29-15-0.. Furman
had a 42-12 win over Marshall
to extend the season record to
5-3. Davidson fell to 4-4 after

| the loss to Guilford.

Last Saturday night started
off badly for Davidson when
Wildcat John Porter fumbled
the opening kickoff. The Quak-
ers took advantage of this break
to score first and went on to up
their halftime lead to 28-19.

Guilford came back in the
second half to add another
seven points and took a 35-19
lead. The Davidson passing
game led the Cats back into the
game.With-the-threwing of Al
Rhyne who passed for a total of
279 yards on eleven of 25
passes, tne Cats knotted the
score at 35-35 with 11:51 left on
the clock.

Guilford’s running game
proved to be the difference of
the game. The Quakers pecked
away 256 yards with 56 rushing
attempts. The passing game for
Guilford was also very success-
ful. The Quakers picked up 192
yards by completing 15 of 20
passes.

After Page Walley had tied
the game with a plunge from the
one yard line and Rhyne hit
Gifford Piercy for a two-point
conversion, the Quakers did
what they had to do to win they
game.

They constructed a 14-play,
75-yard drive that ate five
minutes off of the clock and
picked ‘up the winning score.
Davidson came back 41 yards
with a closing drive but failed to
score before time ran out.
