Blues Explosion and Ben

each other’s new albums

By Curis MANN
Staff Writer

Inthe hardly extensive liner
notes on the Jon Spencer Blues
Explosion’s 1993 release Extra
Width consisting solely of ex-
cerpts from a Bad Vibe maga-
zine review of a jam session,
writer Herb Hitts notes, “... The
explosion celebrated life with
the rock’n’roll spirit raging in-
side their souls.” Now the
Explosion’s back with a second
album, Orange. This time there
are no liner notes — and with

for itself. If you are searching
for some traditional, Mississippi
Delta Blues, look elsewhere.
This is gritty, hard-edged, New
York inner-city blues of the
worst kind. Cocky, rough-shod
gems pervade Orange from the ,
opening “Bellbottoms” all the
way through to the slick, occa-
sionally funky “Greyhound.”

Spencer, former frontman
of the noisy Pussy Galore writes
about cowboys, diggin’ ditches,
sweatin’ profusely, and great
sex. He slurs, scowls, and
screams through 13 tracks, lay-
ing down a couple of splendid
instrumentals along the way.
Definitely not for the weak at
heart. Fortame, clean-cut blues,
go buy Clapton’s From the
Cradle, but if you thirst for
something with gut-wrenching
soul and a nasty disposition, let
the Blues Explosion rock you
“Star Trek style,” whatever that
means.

Somewhere on the dia-
metrically opposite pole of the
music spectrum lies North
Carolina’s own Ben Folds Five.
This threesome takes a
minimalist approach with Ben
Folds’ superb piano playing and
vocals at the forefront, aided by
bass and drums. Their epony-
mous debut LP on Passenger
Records harkens back to early
Billy Joel. That is to say the
Piano Man withoutall the dread-
ful overproduction and dramat-
ics which have plagued his re-
cent efforts. Famed southern
act producer Caleb Southern
does a splendid job of hands-off
production. The listener can
delight in simple harmonies and
straightforward, well-crafted
pop tunes. Sure, there’s some
added saccharine in the lyrics of
many songs, most of which deal
with old acquaintances, a
drugged-out uncle named
Walter and the like, but a
“hummability” and the can’t-
get-it-out-of-your-head feel of
the album prevails in the end. If
you can stand pizza with a little
bit of extra cheese, this is sheer
harmonious bliss.

To set the scene: it is a crisp
Saturday night, and the encircling
throng chants, “Toga! Toga!
Toga!” You have never seen so
many naked legs in one place.

You are standing behind Of-
ficer Scott Misenhammer. You
ask him how many students he
anticipates jailing. “Itjust depends
on how much alcohol they drink,”
he says.

- Turning around, you stumble
into junior Chris Salud, who freely
volunteers, “Well, since you asked
me, this is a great disappointment.
They published ‘Otis Otis Otis,’
but what do we have — ‘nothing
nothing nothing.’”

Many others shared Salud’s
sentiment. Otis was supposed to
play at 10:30 p.m. but made no
appearance until half past eleven.

And then, before anyone real-
ized that he was actually perform-
ing, he was gone again ... destina-

Otis lives on!

tion unknown.

But while he was on-stage,
Otis Day proved why he drew the
biggest crowd in the middle of
Patterson Court since The Dave
Matthews Band’s performance in
1993.

Otis has acquired several new
Knights since he appeared in Ani-

mal House, but other than that (and

_about a half-pound of hair) he

seems very much the man from the
movie.

He played “Shamma-lama- —

ding-dong,” of course, and
“Shout,” both from that already-
too-much-referred-to movie.

The band presented these and

other famous Otis tunes in their
typical jam style that incorporated
elements from classic rock and roll,
blues, and soul.

Bluegrass Experience plays to open of International Week

By JAMES BERRY
Staff Writer

“How am I going to write a
whole article ‘about this? I don’t
know anything about bluegrass!”

My roommate and I had just
settled down to dinner on a slow
Tuesday evening to the sweet
sounds of an acoustic set plunking
along from the dark side of Com-
mons. It’s true. I know nothing
about the music and counted my-
self lucky simply to recognize the
instruments which weren’t quite
as foreign as I’d expected.

In answer to my question my
roommate stared at me dumb-
founded. “Just look at these guys!

Are you trying to tell me you
couldn’t write a page on Earl
alone?”

Earl, we had just learned, was
the powerhouse behind the banjo.
His silver hair sported a rigid crew
cut and the sternness behind his
eyes was enough to convince me
that the man had battalions under
his control. It was this stone gaze
that kept me from betraying any
reaction ‘whatsoever to the music
or the jokes that accompanied it for
fear of his pacing the 30 feet that
separated us and punting my un-
ruly little butt into oblivion.
Whether his somewhat paunch

Disturbing thriller Seven scores in originality

By Ep AcLE
Movie Critic

One school of thought believes
that everything written has basi-
cally been written before. These
days it’s become increasingly dif-
ficult not to extrapolate this school
of thought onto film. In an age
where there are few new ideas com-
ing out of Hollywood, the canni-
balization of older films has be-
come standard practice. At first
glance Seven seems to continue
this trend. What’s worse, the di-
rection makes it difficult at times
to even understand what’s happen-
ing. Uponcloserreview, however,
it becomes apparent thatSeven does
some new things which finally
make it worth seeing.

The story should sound famil-
iar to any regular moviegoer. A
deranged serial killer is on the

loose, killing innocent victims left
and right. A young, fresh-faced
detective with a temper (Brad Pitt)
gets paired up with a wise older
veteran on the verge of retiring

(Morgan Freeman). Together the.

dynamic duo will fight, argue, be-
come friends, then finally try to
find the madman before he strikes
again. Hey, Lethal Weapon meets
Silence of the Lambs!

First the bad news. David
Fincher directed Seven. Knowing
this should automatically set off a
warning signal to anyone who has
ever seen his previous effort,Alien
3. Great directors tell a good story
while still managing to pull off
certain flourishes that let the viewer
know who was behind the camera

at least one character always dis-
