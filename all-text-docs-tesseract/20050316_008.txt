Farmer’s Market offers organic
food and eclectic conversations

By KATHERINE SORRELL

We as students get caught up in talking
about social welfare and advocating for the
rights of those whose voices go unheard, but
I suggest putting your money where your
mouth is and getting to know a vibrant
Charlotte community that often. goes over-
looked. Between the days of Tuesday and
Saturday, from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. and grab
your keys, a few friends and make-your way
to Yorkmont Road in Charlotte.

Listen to a few voices who are certainly
willing to make themselves heard about pret-
ty much anything, including farming, broken
A/Cs, — basketball tournaments, and
Charlotte’s fickle weather. Only the
Charlotte Regional Farmer’s Market offers
good people, good produce, strange soaps,
and the most reasonable of prices.

Aside from selling fresh flowers, organic
produce and fresh baked goods (you can find
the most variety in products on Saturdays),
the Farmer’s Market hosts a very eclectic
group of customers, including men, women,
and children of many ethnicities and socio-
economic levels.

In addition, the vendors, including retired
engineers and insurance salesman as well as
avid golf fans, craftsmen, and of course,
farmers, are extremely eager to chat with
their customers.

They always attempt to remember their
customers’ names and will talk at length
about anything that interests you. Some ven-
dors have worked the market since its open-
ing days 20 years ago. There are others,
however, who have only sold their goods for
a few months.

Whether they have just set up shop or are
long-standing salesman at the market, all of
the vendors will open up to you about the
stories of their lives. A few minutes of con-
versation reveals their unbeatable work
ethic and the pride that they take in their
quality products. Fresh muffins, homemade
salsa, collard greens, or black-eyed peas—
the market offers all of these foods.

In one of the buildings alone, there are
15,000 square feet to explore. Vendors sell
nearly everything that can be found: at
TajMa Teeter for a fraction of the price. I
found that I could buy red potatoes for fifty
cents a pound, when at the supermarket they
cost nearly $4 a pound. I would rather buy
wholesale a few times a month, giving my
money to the farmers themselves, than go
elsewhere. The TajMa Teeter, of course,
benefits from extensive advertisement, and
the Farmer’s Market remains largely
unknown, but believe me, it’s worth the trip.

Even if you are worried about not know-
ing how to prepare the brightly-colored bell
peppers, crisp green beans, tiny bok choy, or
red, white, and sweet potatoes, then don’t go
for the food. Go for the people. And listen
for a while.
