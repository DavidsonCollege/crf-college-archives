Tom McLean, student at the

Union Theological Seminary |
in Richmond, Virginia, con-
ducted the Vesper Services

last Sunday night.

Quoting the Bible verse, “Who-
soever doth not bear his oWwn cross
and come after me cannot be
disciple,” he chose as a subject for
Peril of Follow-

ing Jesus.” He referred to the pas-

his message “The

sage in the New Testament in which
Jesus gave his followers a discourse

upon the dangers of discipleship as |
he was going ‘to Jerusalem for the |

last time.
There were two dangers in fol-
lowing Jesus, he stated. The first

danger is that those who pick up |

his cross will not take him serious-
ly. Among this group will be found
those who follow Jesus for selfish
ends, and those who think religion
is easy, being nothing but a group
of rituals and services which must
be performed. people's
thoughts have resulted in a pitiable
caricature of the religion in Jesus,
as evidenced by conditions in the
world today.

These

The other peril in following Him
is to take him seriously. We have
to bear own and hate
our father, mobher, and even our
own life. We must think of the
cross as more than a symbol: we

our cross,

must see it as a stark, ever-present
reality in life.

Jesus’ summons is to a way of
life. This way is of the cross, and
takes all the courage a main _pos-
sesses. Taking Jesus seriously is a
costly thing, and one dare not take
up that way without first stopping
to count the the

Davidson’s Reputation Asa
Little Chicago is Rapidly

Davidson’s reputation as a
crime center seems to be rap-

idly growing. First it was a
bootleg raid, and then last
week a prophesied—but lucki-

omniscient police force of Lan-

For hours the John Laws stood
watch over the bank, much to the
amusement of the impecunious stu-
dent body, who had nothing what-
soever to lose by the event.

the bystanders
and the relief of those few pluto-
