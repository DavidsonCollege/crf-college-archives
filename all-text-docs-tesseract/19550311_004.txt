"Ten Worst Movies’

Atlanta, Ga. (ACP)—"“The ten

worst movies of 1954" were listed
in the Emory Wheel, “The South’s
Most Independent Collegiate News-

paper,” by columnist Larry Custer.
His choices:

tumed attractive:y, making the

poleon as a great lover.

“Demetrius and the Gladiators”
—They should have left well
enough alone. “The Robe” was
enough.

“The Adventures of Hadjii Ba-
ba"—-We could never figure out
how those tire tracks got out in
the middle of that desert.

“The Egyptian’"—We don’t know
just where they dug this one up.
Sex in spectacular proportions.

“The Vanishing Prairie’—Just a
remake of “The Living Desert,”
but an Oscar should go to those
prairie dogs. And that lady buffa-
lo really put herself into her per-
formance.

“The Barefoot Contessa”"—A fair-
ly good movie, but it had the most
disappointing scene of the year.

“Beau Brummel”—So what was
all the fuss about?

“Prince Valiant”—Just another
one of those medieval horse operas
that seem so popular today. We
could have listed dozens of others.

“Phffft"—The New Yorker best
summed this one up: “tui.”

“White Christmas”—Bing should

OTHER NEEDS

“Higher education must not con-
ceive its relationship to the econ-
omy as a trainer of highly special-
ized manpower and as a center for
research in such terms that its
capacity to fulfill other needs of
American society will be severely
limited,” said Dr. David.

“If the institutions of higher edu-

automatically and with maximum
efficiency only to the current needs
of the economy, they would take

Lambeth looked as good as he
ever did in college in turning loose
his bull’s-eye passes: On two oc-
casions, Alumni receivers missed
getting a TD by letting an on-the-
spot toss slip through their fingers.
Showing the famous calm manner
under fire, Lanfbeth often stepped
back and hit his receivers, only to
see them miss easy grabs. The Var-
sity's pass defense looked shabby,
but it is doubtful that next season

Alumni line failed to become ex-

The game was seen as a success
