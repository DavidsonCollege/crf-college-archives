College students may receive
less government aid in future

By SALLY CAMPBELL
Staff Writer

Students may have fewer
funds available to them for
financial aid if Congress passes
the Carter Administration’s fin-
al budget proposals.

According to the College
Press Service (CPS), the pro-
posed budget calls for a re-
duction of federal funds availab-
le to support Guaranteed Stu-
dent Loans (GSLs), the most
expensive federal financial aid
program. The program is also
widely used. A nationwide sur-
vey of freshmen conducted re-
cently by the University of Cali-
fornia indicated that one stu-
dent out of five has such a loan.

Although all students have
been eligible for the loans in the
past, Carter’s budget proposes
that from now on only students
with established financial need
receive GSLs. The loans would
be limited ‘‘to the amount of
need”’ to be decided by financial
aid officers, according to CPS.

The budget suggests using
‘‘reasonable family contribu-
tions,” other financial aid sour-
ces, and school costs as guide;
lines for determining ‘‘needy”
students and the degree of their
need.

As the program stands,
students borrow money from
banks or state guarantee a-
gencies at an interest rate of 9
percent and the federal govern-
ment pays the difference be-
tween that and the current rate.
Carter’s proposed budget, how-
ever, ‘‘had no provision for pay-
ing the interest subsidy, and
allowed banks to charge stw
dents a higher interest rate on
the loans,” according to CPS.

Associate Director of Finan-
cial Aid Kathleen Stevenson
said Davidson is ‘‘operating
under the assumption that
{availability of GSLs] will be as
it has been in the past.”’

As of December 31, 1980, 275
Davidson students had GSLs.
Stevenson estimated that by
the time the application process
is complete, 300 students will
have GSLs to help finance their
education.

There are no extra funds
available through Davidson to
help “‘non-need’’ students who
currently hold GSLs. ‘‘We
would be able to continue
supplying loans on the basis of
financial need, but non-need
based loans would not be avail-
able through Davidson,’’ Steve-
nson said, since financial aid at
Davidson is based on need.

Faculty OKs PAC salary proposals

By TIM WHALEN
-- Assistant News Editor

“The faculty passed the Pro-
fessional Affairs Committee’s
(PAC) recommendations for in-
creased faculty salaries on
Tuesday, according to PAC
representative Lance Stell.

Stell said the recommenda-
tions passed with only one
dissenting vote.

The recommendations are
contained in a report prepared
by Stell of the PAC in conjunc-
tion with Physics Professor Bob
Manning of the American As-
sociation of University Profes-
sors (AAUP).

President Spencer will pre-
sent the report’s five recom-
mendations of the Board of
Trustees at their meeting in two
weeks. The recommendations
are:

1. That the President report to
the faculty whether there exists
an institutional resolve to halt
the deterioration in the faculty’s
financial position and to begin

the restoration of the losses

experienced over the past 14
years.

2. That the minimum salary
increase for each faculty mem-
ber should offset the rise in the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for
the previous year. Merit in-
creases should be added to this
base.

3. That the targeted increase in
endowment for faculty purposes
in the 1987 Program be adjust-
ed upward to offset anticipated
rises in the price level.

4. That Davidson’s extremely
unfavorable relative position for
salary compensation at the
Assistant Professor level
amongst North Carolina insti-
tutions be rectified quickly.
5. That the College aim for
quadrupling of the endowment
over the next 10 years.

Stell said, ‘‘the near unani-
mous endorsement by faculty
should give the Trustees reason
to consider the report closely.’’

Manning said, ‘‘The recom-
mendations that salaries rise
with the CPI is long overdue

and the health of the institution
depends on it,”’ adding. ‘‘I don’t
see how the College can con-
tinue to pay the faculty less
money every year.” He explain-
ed that over the last decade the
faculty’s salaries have been
steadily declining in terms of
constant dollars.

However, Vice President for
Academic Affairs Price Zim-
mermann said last week that
there was ‘‘no chance’”’ of the
second recommendation’s pass-
ing at the Board of Trustees
meeting.

The only discussion about the
proposals involved the gheond
recommendation, according to
Stell. He said that some fauclty
members felt the administration
can ensure superiour perfor-
mance from tenured faculty
only by granting salary in-
creases solely on a merit basis.

The Faculty’s Council on Fi-
nance and Development also
passed the recommendations
and will present them to the
Trustees, according to Council
Chairman Earl MacCermac.

Students piqued at planned parking changes

By JENNY O’BRIANT
Staff Writer

Proposed changes in campus
parking and traffic patterns ha
upset some students, according
to SGA senator Kevin Pressley.
- Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver Meetze discussed the plann-
ed changes at the SGA meeting
on Feb. 5.

Meetze said that the adminis-
tration plans to convert the
road running between Belk and
the laundry into a walkway.
The traffic from that road will
be routed around Patterson
Court turning Patterson Court
into a ‘‘main artery”’ for traffic,
according to Meetze.

‘In addition, the parking lot
on the west side of Belk will
remain open, and the road
running from Jackson Court to
the gym will be expanded to two
lanes.

Pressley said, ‘‘most people
think that the changes will

cause more congestion around
Patterson Court because the
people use the roads now as
much for walking as riding.’’ He
also said, ‘‘The average student
wants to be able to park as close
to his eating house as he can.”’

Meetze said that walkways
will be put in across Patterson
Court to the eating houses. He
said that the new walkways and
perimeter parking will make the
campus more compact.

He stressed that the adminis-
tration does not plan to cut
down on campus parking spaces
but to relocate them. Two new
parking areas will be added to
opposite ends of Patterson
Court, he said.

He also emphasized student
involvement in the parking
situation. The students rather
than the administration should
be the ones most concerned
about the parking situation, he
said.

Black students cite need for role models, social opportunities

more black faculty members.

background in common.”

News Editor

Black students feel that Davidson still has some
distance to go in satisfying their needs.

This was the view that dominated Wednesday’s
panel discussion sponsored by the Black Student
Coalition.

Entitled ‘‘Black America: A Davidson Perspective,” —

the forum consisted of a panel of black students fielding
questions from five international students.

French Professor Charles Dockery, who moderated
the discussion, said the students chose the format
“because of the unique status of the international
students as newcomers to our community.”

Dockery added that they were ‘‘unbiased”’ and could
‘‘shed new light on black students and their
relationship to the campus.”

A major concern of the students was the need for

Junior James Jones said, ‘‘We need more black
professors since they have experienced some of our
same problems. It’s hard to talk to white professors
since their background is different.’’

Sophomore Yvette Mingo disagreed. ‘‘You can talk
to white professors. The fact that we’re a minority is
something we've always lived with and something that
won’t change soon.”

‘‘Black professors would act as role models,
something we don’t have right now,” she added.

Monique Daam of Belgium asked the panel if they
felt isolated from other black students.

Sophomore Leo Walker said, ‘‘I personally don’t feel
we're isolated from other black students.”’ He also
pointed out that athletics is a common focus for many
Blacks on campus.

“Athletics is important but an athlete at Davidson

- must be a student as well. We all have our academic

Senior Vincent Parker felt athletics often serve to
divide Black students.

“F don’t play basketball or football. The majority of
Black guys here do. I felt isolated when I came
freshman year because all the other guys had been here
for a few weeks working out and already knew each

other. (Continued on page 11)
