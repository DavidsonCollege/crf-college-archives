Cross country off to good s

By MARK POSTOVE

The Davidson cross country

team evened its record at 1-1
with two meets last week.

The Wildcats defeated High
Point Thursday in a meet run in
the rain over the Panthers’
mud-slicked course.

Two days. later, Georgia
State edged Davidson in a dual
meet scored from the results of
the Stone Mountain Road Race
in Georgia.

High Point’s Dennis Couahey
was the overall winner in 27:44
over the five mile course.
Davidson took second and
third, with junior co-captain
Coty Pinckney finishing in
28:11 and freshman Doug Horn
in 28:12.

Rounding out Davidson's top
five were senior Fred Borch in
fifth place, junior John Barks-
dale in seventh, and sophomore
Zack Murrell in 11th.

The usual method of scoring
the top five finishers for each
team resulted in a 28-28 tie.
However, the tie-breaker of
scoring the top four gave
Davidson a 17-19 victory, the
low score winning in cross
country.

“I wasn't displeased at all

with the team,” said Coach
Sterling Martin. “In fact, I was
quite pleased. High Point has
picked up some _ outstanding
freshmen.

“This was our first race of the
season, while High Point had
already run two meets. This
gave them a little edge over
us,” commented one of the
runners.

On Saturday, Davidson par
ticipated in the Stone Mountain
Road Race, a five-mile race
which attracted over 400 run
ners from the southeaster Uni
ted States. The top five fin
ishers for the Cats were the
same as in the High Point meet.

Pinckney finished 46th in
26:11, a personal best, which is
better than a
average,

“Coty was 47th last year in
26:53, so although he improved
42 seconds, he only moved up
one placecommented Martin.

“This indicates the strength
of this year’s field.”

Another indication of the
improved competition was the
performance of Georgia State's
top runner, Wayne Roach. He
finished third last year, but
could manage only sixth place
this year despite a time of

ing course record.

Horn ran 26:50 for 77th
place, while Borch finished in
84th place in 27:04,
personal best.

“Horn did a beautiful job,”
said Martin, “but Borch has
been the real surprise of the
team. He did an outstanding
job. He has improved tremen
dously.”

Koller and Martin ran in the
30-40 group, with respective
times of 33:50 and 30:40. Kol-

considering this was his first
competitive distance race ever,
according to Martin.

With the start of practice less
than a month away, the wo-
men’s basketball team does not
have a coach.

A conservative
interpretation of the rules at
the 1974-1975 NAIA Women's
basketball tournament stripped
the team of its coach. Accord-
ing to the rules, the coach of a
women's team must be, “wo-
men whenever possible,” and
the coach cannot be an under-
graduate student.

At the state tournament last
year, a resident of Davidson
was acting as the official coach
despite the fact that all coach-
ing decisions were made by
men undergraduates.

Following an opening round
victory, a protest against Dav-
idson’s eligibility was filed be-
fore the NAIA. No action was
taken against the team and the
victory was allowed to stand.
But it was made clear that the
team could not play this year
with undergraduate coaches.

The athletic administration's
delay in finding a new coach has
turned many of the team mem-
bers against the administra-
tion.

“They've hardly been: help-
ful, all want is to play
basketball, and now this tech-
nicality is holding us_ back.
We're getting a raw deal,” said
one team member.

Joe Dunean, one of last
year’s undergraduate coaches,
agreed with this view. Duncan
pointed out that while the
women's team takes the game
as seriously as the men’s team,
the athletic department has yet
to treat the two teams on
an equal basis.

“They don't pay as much
attention to the girls’ basket-
ball program as they should or
where they would anywhere
else,” Duncan stated.

Athletic Director Thom Cart-
mill feels however that, “there
is no basic change on the part of
the administration.”

Cartmill also stated that a
coach is expected to be chosen
from several applicants, “with
intercollegiate experience,”
within the next week.
