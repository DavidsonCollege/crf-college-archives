NEW BOOKS PURCHASED

Records Show Tuition Now
Higher Than in 1837

On display this week in the

dibrary is a collection of old

Davidson College documents
and papers belonging to Dr.
Walter L. Lingle.

These documents include one of
the first diplomas issued. It is in-
teresting to note in this connection
that the first class. was not the
class of 1837, but the class of 1840.
No graduation exercises were held
until 1840, when the first class re-
ceived their diplomas, one of which
is now on display. pe

Slave Release

There is also a_ slave release
written and signed by Maxwell
Chambers, who donated the bulk

of the cost of old Chambers build-
ing. A receipt for tuition paid in
September of 1837 shows that tui-
tion in those days was somewhat
lower than today.

A report on the college by a
committee of the Fayetteville Pres-
bytery shows that four faculty
members was cohsidered a reason-
able size and that two dollars was
considered not too much to ask
for room rent. Other papers give
further insight into life at Davidson
in the early days.

The jacket display this week rep-
resents books ~purchased recently
by various academic departments,
those of most general interest be-
ing a number of interesting and
helpful books bought by the Eng-
lish department. The upstairs

ets from books bought by the for-
eign language departments,

New Books

Some new books purchased this
year which have not been mention-
ed in these columns before are:
“New Light on Hebrew Origins,”
by J. Garrow Duncan; Hugh Wal-
pole’s “A Prayer for My Son;”
Lloyd George’s War Memoirs for
the final months of the war, 1918;
“Planning Under Capitalism,” by
A. W. Rather, and the 1936 edition
of Chemical Formulary, contain-
ing new formulas, new methods and
new chemicals.

During the course of the year
the library has added to its lists
several new magazines. The new
“Life” and “Scribner's” have come
as continuations of the older mag-
azines by those names. “Coronet” is
now subscribed to, as well as
“Asia.” Several of the new “Di-
gests” which are now flooding the
market are also being received. A
number of back numbers have been
bound, including the “Reader’s Di-
gest.”

Professor Davidson is continy-
ing his duties as librarian in spite
of his added burden of two classes
in the History department.

DR. CALDWELL SPEAKS
TO MINISTERIAL BAND
ON SEMINARY CHOICE

Against Being Misled By |
Unsound Advice

ADVISES INVESTIGATION |

Speaks at Salisbury Before
Coming Here |

Frank H. Caldwell, president
of Louisville Theological Sem-
inary, talked to the Ministerial
Band at 2:30 last Sunday af-
ternoon in the Social Center
on the subject, “Choosing
Your Seminary.” |

During his talk Dr. Caldwell
warned the members of the band
against being led into
by unsound advice, and told how to

seminaries

not be-
cause one’s pastor or friends advise
it, he explained.
Location and Cost |
“Also,” he said, “do not enter a|

seminary because of the location, |
or because it is near home. And do |
not consider the cost much, |
for practically all are about the |
same in this respect.” |

In choosing a seminary he
vised the group to investigate the
prospective institution carefully.

“Look into its faculty, its curri-
culum, and especially see whether
or not its student body is cosmo-
politan,” he said.

Dr. Caldwell also pointed out the
fact that, generally speaking, it is
best to go into the seminary di-
rectly from college, of
waiting one or two years as many
He explained that students
who wait often get side-tracked |
into other occupations and give up
the ministry.

Answers Questions |

After his address he opened the |
floor for discussion, and replied to
questions on seminary life and oth-
er aspects of Louisville Seminary.

Before coming to Davidson to
talk to the Ministerial Band, Dr.
Caldwell preached at the Sunday
morning service of the Presbyterian
Church in Salisbury. After deliver-
ing the sermon at vespers here Sun-
day night, he left f6r Winston-
Salem.

It was also brought out at the
meeting that Ward 1 of the Meck-
lenburg Sanatorium had requested
four more Sunday School teachers.
Two of these, D. A. McLean and
D. D. McInnis, have already been
secured, and the officers of the |
Ministerial Band will appreciate
volunteers for the other two posi-
tions.

The next meeting of the Band
will be held on Siinday afternoon,
April 18. |

Philip Merivale says:

“My throat’s grateful for Luckies

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who
said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated

they personally prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Merivale verifies the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
‘Te’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.

In one of the first important parts I
did in America, the play called for a
long and very trying individual perform-
ance. In every scene for five full acts I

ously. The strain made it imperative that
I safeguard my throat and voice. After
trying different brands of cigarettes, I
came across Luckies. They stood the test
