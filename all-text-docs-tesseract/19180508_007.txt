PHI SOCIETY, SAT. NIGHT.

The meeting of the Phi Society Sat-
urday night was a very fitting one to
close a very successful year of work. In
place of the regular program, the tithe
was taken up by several orations and
other speeches. The: following orations
were given: “QO. Henry,” by R. H.
Stone; “America’s Attitude Toward the

War,” Peters; ‘Generalissimo Foch,”
W. T. Dunlap, Jr.; “The Lrish Ques-
tion,” by . Currie; and “Our

Neighbor Mexico,” by R. C. Garth. A
selection from Wendell Philips’ “The
Scholar and Politics.” was given by C.
G. Long. D. M. Chalmers and W. C.
Cumming. contested in a very heated ex-
temporaneous debate concerning the con-
tinuance of society meeting during
Exams. Both sides were ably defended
by their supporters. The judges decided | =
2 to 1 in favor of the affirmative. After
a brief business meeting the society ad-

journed to take up regular society work|(§

on September 7, 1918. At the next
meeting the recently elected officers will
be installed and the reports of the pres-
ent officers will be considered.

J. D. Howell, ex-'20, stopped over on
his way home from Annapolis and spent
Monday on the Hill.
