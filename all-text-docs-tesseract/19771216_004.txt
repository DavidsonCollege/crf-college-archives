A
After Marburg...

Davidson does not measure up

By DAVE NASH

The hardest thing about going
abroad for your junior year is having
to come back to Davidson. I have felt
closed-in and frustrated since I got

back, but only recently have I come to -

understand why Ifeel that way. I
want to get at some of the reasons by
first describing the situation in M-
burg and then applying my exper-
iences there to Davidson. This is by
no means a full comparison of Phillips
University and Davidson Collége. ith

_more could be said. I am in the 900
Room almost every night.

Met of the courses in the German
liberal arts curriculum are seminars
with 25 to 100 students. (the few
lecture courses that exist have 50 to
200 students, generally cover basic
topics, and are often bad.) The
seminars differ greatly from Davidson
poses a general title and syllabus for
the course, but the latter is open to
discussion by the class. The entire
group influences the direction the
course it to take and chooses specific
topics to be discussed. The students
often modify and sometimes com-
pletely change the professor's propo-
sal.

Because the groups are so big they
divide up into work groups of four or
five, each taking a specific topic,
studying it in depth, and presenting a
short paper for discussion by the
entire class. The work groups I was in
turned out to be excellent learning
experiences. For example, in one we
studied the idea of the charactefin
drama. Because of a quirk in the
German language, we had trouble

deciding if we were supposed to be
discussing characters in drama or the
character (essence) of drama. We
worked on the first until somebody
suggested that maybe we were sup-
posed to do the second. After a week
we realized that we were trying to do
the impossible, so we went back to the
first. In all the confusion, however,
we came up with some intriguing
questions. I feel that I learned much
more from those questions than I
would have learned had I been given
the anwers.

Mybe I should get to the point.
Davidson is frustrating. Met of the
courses are lecture courses where the
class just accepts what the professor
says. A lecture is an efficient way of
covering material--everyone knows
that we cover more in one term than
many schools cover in two--, but I
question how much we are learning.
Sometimes | feel as if 1 am only

learning to paraphrase on a test what

the professor says in class and then to
forget it as soon as exams are over.
The seminar I have now is very
refreshing, but I have heard that they
are not all so good. We fall too easily
into our classroom roles where pro-
fessors are authorities required to
think and students are only supposed
to get it all down in 50 minutes. The
alternative is the yo-yo discussion
where the professor ends up answer-
ing his own questions_when students
cannot anticipate him. It seems we
would all learn'so much more if we
could think and discuss on the same
level. Mybe then Davidson would be
an academic community (in my view,

a place of real learning and not just

accumulation of knowledge.) It is not .

now, but nobody is really to blame;
that is, everybody is to blame.

I’m also frustrated by the paterna-
lism of the administration, The three

_course requirement is a good example.

Why does the administration feel it
needs tto strictly enforce such an
artificial measure of what we are
learning? Well, Davidson is a contin-
uing educational experience. Fine.
What does the number of courses
taken per term have to do with a
continuing educational experience?
Why can’t a two course term be just
as educational as a three course term?
Becuase you don’t cover as much

The other reasons given for the new
move hardly deserve mention. ONe
implies that students are not mature
enough to avoid a pre-graduation
disaster”. Another defends the need
for ‘uniformity’ in the running of a
small college.

The three course requirement does
not really bother me. The attitudes

behind it do. I think that Davidson is
in a very bad position at the moment.
We lack the real basis and momentum
of-an_academic community, and the
attitudes of the administration are
pushing us backward instead of
forward. But they should not have to
take the blame either.

The essence of all this is that we are
standing in our little pools of compla-
cency when we really need to be
moving together to improve our
situation. We need to change--or at
least talk about--many things. The
three course requirement is a small
one. If you want a big one try
Christian Tenure. But we can’t just
concentrate on that kind of issue,
because we always seem to get caught
in the emotional overtones and lose
sight of the underlying concern--that
Davidson be (or become) an academic
community of the highest order. I
think the place to start is in the
classroom with a reevaluation of our
purposes and methods of learning. If
we start any higher, we'll miss the

point.

‘Tis the season for
song and fun

REV. HYDEN SEEKER

There are many ways to tell when
its close to Christmas around David-
son. One sure way is noting the
characteristic cramming for before
break reviews. Another method that
is not as prevalent this year is
recognizing hw most of the talk about
the basketball team by Christmas
time concerns next season.

Then again, there’s always the °

sound of spontaneously organized
carolers singing into the night that
indicates that the Christmas spirit
has indeed descended upon Davidson.
to these latter-mentioned makers of
merriment I would like to offer a
special gift. It occured to me that
these carolers might occasionally get
tired of singing the same songs overr
and over again. After all, most of

“them have been around for genera-

tions. Some of the following, if not
more enjoyable, may at least be more

DECK US ALL

‘(sung to. the tune of ‘‘Deck the

“Halls.”’) :

Deck us all with courses plenty,

Fa la la la la, what else to do?
To hell with three, just give us
twenty,

Fa la la la la, ‘You can’t take two!”
Zimmerman wants sharp precision,

(Load us up, load us up, we’re here
to learn)

So he makes our own decision,
Fa la la la la, there goes spring term!

I’ MREAMAG OF A TRUE UPDATE

(Sung to the tune of ‘‘White Christ-
mas)

I’m dreaming of a true Update,
Alumni have a right to know

meses uc zlemes leaving

So Football’s grieving
And Jewish hiring’s going slow...

I’m dreaming of a true Update
Where good (and bad) remain in
sight;Though its news is dreary and
trite,

At least, may its articles be right.

IN____EXBISML, _ PEPTO
(Sung to the tune of ‘‘Joy to the
World’’)

Joy to the Girls, of A-R-A!

Let earth grow old in line.

Let every heart, with gas consume.
And wonders of Ron’s fries,

And of the meat he buys,

And temptuous temptings for the
flies.

OH S.A.E., OH S.A.E.

(sung to the tune of “O, Christmas
Tree’’)

Oh S.A.E.,oh S.A.E.,

Your parties are a treasure.
From boxes juke, at half-past three,
You've given us such pleasure.
You play it loud so we can hear,
That you've got lots of Christmas
cheer,
But that’s because you're full of beer,
Oh, S.A.E., oh S.A.E.

WDAV

(Sung to the tune of “‘O Little town of
Bethelehem’’)

O little W.D.A.V.,

Your tastes make sane men cry.
Above us all you claim to be,
With a staff that’s oh, so high.
But in that dark, deep basement
Lies “Heart” and ‘‘Fleetwood At”:
Just take a clue from R-0-Q,
You'll get some listeners back.

My everyone have a safe and joyous
holiday season!
