Renowned Poet Sharon Olds Will Appear ‘Thursday

Sharon Olds, one of the most
popular contemporary poets in the
world, will read from her work at
Davidson College on Thursday,
November 21. The event is free
and open to the public, beginning
at 7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room of the
Union.

Olds is widely recognized for
her television appearance on Bill
Moyers’s 1989PBS program, “The
Power of the Word.” She has given
readings of her work, which boldly

probes intimate private experience
and calls for conscientious public
attention, at more than 100 of the
finest colleges and universities na-
tionwide, as well as the Library of
Congress, the Folger SHakespeare
Library, and the National Council
on the Arts in Washington, D.C.
Olds’s poems frequently appear
in The New Yorker, The Paris
Review, The Nation, Poetry, and
other magazines. Olds also leads
workshops around the country. It
was at the Geraldine R. Dodd
Festival that Bill Moyers taped her

for use in his PBS series on poetry.

The 1991 edition of the Norton
Introduction to Literature contains
nine poems by Olds, more than by
Ezra Pound or Sylvia Plath, Wal-
lace Stevens or W.H. Auden. Her
poetry has been translated into
French, Italian, Chinese, Russian,
and Estonian.

Stephen Yenser, writing in The
Yale Review, said of Olds’s poems
in The Gold Cell, “Olds character-
istically shoulders muance aside
and goes straight at her subjects.
Her work is chock-full of striking

metaphors that are rarely delicate,
never precious.”

Publishers Weekly said of her
work, “She has the cathartic power,
fury and righteousness of aMedea,
an Antigone of our time.”

Born in San Francisco in 1942,
Olds earned a B.A. with distinc-
tion from Stanford University and
a Ph.D. in English from Columbia
University. She currently lives in
New York City, where she is an
associate professor in the graduate
writing program at New York
University.

Olds has won the Best Younger
Poets Award, a National Endow-
ment for the Arts fellowship grant
in poetry and a Guggenheim
Memorial Foundation fellwoship
grant. Her first book, Satan Says,
was published in 1980. The Living
and the Dead, published in 1983,
won both the Lamont Poetry Prize
of the Academy of American Poets
and the National Book Critics
Circle Award. Her third book, The
Gold Cell, was published in 1987.
The Sign of Saturn was published
in 1991, and The Father is due
from Knopf in March, 1992.
