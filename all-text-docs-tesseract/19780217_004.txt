Money or morals?

The question of Davidson's investment
policy raised by Jeff Metzel is important.
Is Davidson indirectly supporting a racist
* regime in South Africa by investing our
funds in companies that operate there?
We think so. Granted, the question can
be debated on many levels.

Some think the multinationals repre-
sent a progressive element in South
Africa. They have promised to work for
racial equality at the workplace. On the
other hand, there is Ghiy so much they
can do. Under Apartheid, it is illegal to
pay equal wages to blacks and. whites.
And at this point, it looks like white
supremacy rule is there to stay.

We think it basically boils down to
this: the South African government is an
extremely repressive regime dedicated to
the principle of white supremacy. The
country’s economy and therefore the
success of that government depends
largely on investment from abroad (of
which 17 to 20 percent comes from the
United States). By investing its funds in
companies that do business in South
Africa, Davidson is neiping to support
Apartheid. The connection may be tenu-

ous, but nevertheless it is there.

What should Davidson do? The final
answer has to come from the college
community, but here are a couple of
possibilities. We could put pressure on
the companies and support any stock-
holder votes to withdraw from South
Africa. Or we could invest our money
elsewhere.

Will Davidson’s action affect the
course of history? No, not by itself, but a
rumber of colleges around the country
have taken action already (Oberlin and
Wisconsin are notable. examples), and
Davidson could play a part in a growing
grassroots movement. There is no ques-
tion of the importance of such a
movement. It is highly unlikely that
change will come from the corporations
or governments involved without consi-
derable pressure from the bottom.

We do realize tnat Davidson's tinancial
position cannot be ignored. The college
might have to give up some very
profitable investments, but, in the end,
this is a question of moral integrity. If we
really are a Christian college, we’d better

show it. —DVave Nash

Enough talk

From The Davidsonian, December 19,
1975, in an article concerning evaluation
of faculty for promotion and tenure:

“Spencer, following an outline pro-
posed by ex-Vice President for Academic
Affdirs John M. Bevan, is ‘working on a
more systemized and formalized set of
procedures which spell out the criteria
more specifically.”

Now, over two years later, the Student
Government Association is expressing
its concern that Davidson College suffers
from the “lack of well-defined procedures
and policies for faculty evaluation.”

Since the College Administration’s
December 15 decision not to renew the
contract of Professor Tonia Devon (the
event that motivated the SGA resolution),
the pages of this newspaper have been
filled with articles, editorials, and letters
concerning the procedures used by the
Administration in evaluating Devon.

There has been talk from one side that
the evaluation process was “unprofes-
sional,” “incompetent,” “unethical.”
There has been talk from another side
that Davidson will retain only the “very
best” professors, that it seeks “not just a
good faculty, but an outstanding one.”

From one side, talk. From another
side, taik. There has been enough talk.

When the SGA resolution is presented

to the the Trustees, we ask the Board to
act, to issue a directive that sets
Davidson College on the course of
establishing a code of faculty evaluation
procedures.

A push from the top is. necessary to
bring all elements of the community
—students, faculty, and administra-
tion—into the evaluation process.

Students must participate repsonsibly
through course and instructor critiques.
The. faculty must assume the burden of
judging itself through a faculty commit-
tee on Appointment, Evaluation, and
Tenure. The administration, while retain-
ing the final and decisive voice in faculty
hiring, must show willingness to decen-
tralize the evaluation process and solicit
broad-based input so as to avoid the:
appearance of a ‘closed-door, smoke-fil-
led room” process.

We have said before, and say again
that as long as Davidson College
operates without a professional code of
evaluation for faculty, its efforts to
encourage good scholarship and obtain
truly outstanding teachers are crippled.
The longer that Davidson operates with-
out a code, the more rumors we will hear
of inconsistent and arbitrary administra-
tive evaluations.

From fhe Davidsonian, January 20,
1978, in ai article concerning evaluation
of faculty for promotion and tenure.

‘He (Vice President for Academic

Affairs Zimmermann) and Spencer con-
cur that a “more thorough-going evaiua-
tion” and more specific guidelines are
needed. ; ‘een

“We are currently working with. the
Professional Affairs Committee of the
Faculty on revising this whole procedure
in an attempt to put it in a codified
form.’”

Remember the adage “the more things i

change, the more they stay the same”?
We must not allow it to hold true at

Letter to the Editor

‘Token’ view of Jew

To the Editor:

For the last fews weeks The
Davidsonian has _ played
the soapbox for various view-
points concerning the Middle
East situation. Being a Jew, I
suppose there’s the possibility
that I may be oversensitive to
certain allegations concerning
‘my people but, be that as it
may, I would now like to offer
my own token opinion.

Before anything else let me
explain the concept of God’s
chosen people as it was taught
to me in my 8 years of Hebrew
school at an orthodox shul. It is
not in any sense a doctrine that
proclaims that due to my ances-
try I am in any way more

deserving of reward or privilege -

by divine activity. Rather it is

the obligation to lead an exem-~

plary life as according to the
torah, in return for a personal
G-d’s historic intervention.

Secondly, some further infor-
mation concerning the massacre
at Deir Yasin (and should it
matter, my source is the
London Times, a paper that
could hardly be considered pro-
jewish at the time(. It seems
people enjoy harping on this
singular incident as proof of the
intrinsic murderous mentality
of the Palestinian Jews. It
should be remembered that this
atrocity was committed by a
terrorist group typical of but a
small minority of the Jews.
Furthermore, Official organiza-
tions, such as the Jewish
Agency, wished to express its
horror and disgust” upon know-
ledge of the massacre. (For
myself, I cannot recall any
official Arab condemnation of
Arab terrorism.)

Thirdly it should be noted
that terrorism was: definitely a
mutually practiced maneuver.
As early as 1920 there is a
documentation of anti-Jewish

violence by the Arabs. Before .

Deir Yasin, within a period of a
few months there were Arab
terrorist attacks on Jewish
colonies such as Tireh (assaul-
ted by 40-50 Arabs), Ramat
Rachel (attacked by approxi-
mately 100 Arabs), Neve
yaacov, Hartov, and Mishmar
Haemen, to name a few. (As far
as I can tell the only difference
between these terrorist activi-

success at carrying out the
original intention.)

Official Arab statements as
the time consisted of such
quatations as Syria's Prime
Minister Mardem Bey’s state-
ment calling for ‘‘teach(ing) the
treacherous Jews an unforget-
able lesson” and M. Chamoun
of Lebanon’s proclamation that
the Jewish state would envelope
the entire Mid-east and that the
Arabs were defending the world
against communism which was
being introduced by Zionists. (I
guess Moscow’s ties with the
Arab nations must have slipped
M. Chamoun’s mind at the
time.)

Upon the declaration of state-
hood by Israel after the end of
the British Mandate (the Jews
were not in any way given
Palestine on a silver platter),
the state proclamation called for
equality for all inhabitants
without distin ction for race,
creed, or religion, and for amity
with the Arab nations. The
response to this was invasion on
all sides. Fighting would again
be initiated by the arabs in
three more succesive wars.

Nor has Arab terrorism
stopped as can be witnessed by
MaaLot or the ‘72 Olympics.
Certainly I can’t condone the
Israeli reprisal but I would like
to recall the bombing to Beirut
airport in which.the Israelies
warned of the oncoming bomb-
ing so that only planes and not
people would be destroyed.

Now Israel is being blamed
for the failings of the present
peace conferences which, as has
been pointed out in a previous
letter, called for demands never
considered legitimate by Israel
at present. (I wonder how
people can expect Israel to hand
over the West Bank when such
groups as Yasser, Arafat’s PLO
have dedicted themselves to the
destruction of the Israeli state.)

I do not want anyone to think
that I consider Israel to be
blameless for its actions and
positions but I do think it is
necessary for people to realize

that the Arabs have not been |

the most conscientious of
neighbors. Perhaps when both
sides truly realize that conces-
sions must be made with equal

‘ consideration peace will be had.
