team drove out cight hits, but Davidson's
fielding was superior to that of the Le-
noir boys.

“Buck” Flowers led in batting, get-
ting three hits out of four trips to the
plate, Captain “Dutch ~Hengeveld
played first base, and nothing got by him.
Rufus Clarke made his debut as a pitch-
er, and acquitted himself well, while
Burns upheld the receiving end. Errors
at critical moments were largely respon-
sible for Lenoir’s defeat.

WHITE SOX VS. NO SOX.

AGUA

While Davidson's “big league" team
is away winning victories, Sprunt field
is seeing some wonderful games. ‘Those
that play call if baseball, but to the spec-
tators it looks more like a track meet.
An aggregation of “stars” who, unfor-
tunately, did not go out for Varsity base-
hall, issued a challenge to the rest of the
student body for a triple-header Monday
afternoon. “They styled themselves the
“White Sox" amd the student body team
that responded received the name ‘No
Sox.” Everybody wanted to pitch, but
finally Knox and Stogner out-talked the
other candidates and took the mound, for
the first game. ‘The heavy hitting that
followed was cnough to gladden the
heart of any college coach, but the same
thing cannot be said for the pitching.
No one attempted to keep the score. so,
alas, both still claim the victory. The
second and third games were duplicates
of the first except for the fact that new
twirlers were introduced. Among the
best of these was Love. whose very
wind-up struck terror in’ the batters’
hearts. Perhaps in some future day an
investigation will be held to determine
the winners in these important games.
Other games will follow thruout. the
week until everybody has been given a
chance to demonstrate their ability as a

second “Christy.”
