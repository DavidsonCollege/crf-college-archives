above the rest and seemed to
completely fulfill all the neces-
sary qualifications, according to
Jackson.

Warren visited the campus
and met students, faculty, and
administrators. Jackson said he
got varied student reactions,
but nothing negative. Also, the
faculty was polled.

“Everyone seemed to feel he
was a good choice. I think they
trusted my recommendation,”
said Jackson.

Physics

The Physics Department and
the administration decided
Wednesday on the final selec-
tion of a candidate to replace
Professor of Physics John I.
Hopkins, who is retiring.

“Our first choice turned out
to be the administration’s first
choice. Presumably, an offer is
going out to him this after-
noon,’’ said Professor of Phy-
sics Locke White, Jr.

White added, ‘‘He’s a mighty :

strong candidate and I hope he
accepts.’’ According to White,
the department was looking for
a younger person with particu-
lar competence in astronomy
and low temperature physics.

Close to two hundred appli-
cations were recieved in re-
sponse to an advertisement.
White also interviewed appli-
* cants at the convention of the
American Physics Society in
San Fransisco.

The department also sent
notices of the opening to some
women’s institutions in the
Southeast hoping to get an
increased number of qualified
applicants. However, White
said, only one woman was under
consideration after the preli-
minary screening and she was
not chosen as one of the four
final candidates.

White said, ‘‘We had a whole
lot of Orientals and Asiatics
apply, but none of the appli-
cants I know to be black.”’ All
of the four final candidates were
white males.

Each of the four top candi-
dates had lunch with the senior
and junior physics majors and
gave a colloquium. White said,
“We consulted the students for
their reactions, superficially,
I’m sorry to say. Time sort of
got away from us. There was a
pretty clear concensus among
the students.”’

White said that Zimmermann
had told him that any disagree-
ments between the administra-
tion and the department would
be resolved by discussion. How-
ever, White noted, ‘‘They can
make the offer and we can’t.”

Religion

The Religion Department is
in the process of making final

selections for a permanent re-
placement for former Professor
of Religion Gordon Michalson,
said Professor of Religion Alex-
ander McKelway, Jr.

The top four candidates have
already visited the campus and
been interviewed by the admini-
stration and the department.

McKelway said, “There. were
around a hundred applicants.
‘We were looking for someone
who could teach an introductory
course in Buddhism, teach an
introductory course in religious
phenomenology (the study of
religion), and show theological
and philosophical competence.

McKelway commented, ‘‘We
received applications from peo-
ple of almost every religion. The
fact is there was not a non-Chris
tian to our™knowledge who

seemed to us to be completely,

qualified for the position. All
those that we felt had the
credentials turned out to be
Christians.”’

Each of the top four candi-
dates gave a lecture which
students attended, and stu-
dents were then informally con-
sulted.

“Student opinion is certainly
an important factor. We defin-
itely seek student participation
in the evaluation process. Their
opinions seemed to be close to
our opinions,’’ explained Mc-
Kelway.

There have been no major
conflicts between the depart-
ment and administration over
the selection of the candidates.
McKelway said, ‘‘We find the
department recommendation
weighs very heavily: At least
we have not been frustrated.

He added,‘‘It’s not that the
administration rubber stamps
our decision. Our own selection
process has been effective.”

Sociology

The Sociology Department is
seeking a senior professor to
chair the department, a position
vacated by Professor of -Socio-
logy Joseph T. Drake: in 1977.

“Acting Department
Chairman Robert D. Ruth poin-
ted out that the candidate
chosen for the position will
come in with academic tenure.
‘‘We will have to be extra
careful in the sense that if we
make a mistake it could haunt
us for decades.’’ he said.

Zimmermann explained, ‘In
a junior candidate we're looking
for promise. For a tenured
position the standards are more
severe. We want to see the
evidence now. If their talent
hasn’t developed by now, it’s
not going to.”’

Ruth described the depart-
ment’s expansion as being very
important in terms of new areas
and having a more just and
adequate department.

The Sociology Department
has a higher student-faculty
ratio than any other, he noted.

The ideal candidate, remark-
ed Ruth, would have a strong
background in several areas
including population and demo-
graphy, race and ethnic rela-
tions, collective behavior and
social movement, social devi-
ance, methodology and stati-
stics, and woman's studies.

There were approximately 45
applicants for the position of
Department Chairman.

Spencer has said from the

beginning of our search, and

Zimmermann has re-echoed
that we are going to give every
possible consideration to minor-
ity candidates; particularly
blacks and women.” said Ruth.

Three candidates, one a wo-
man, have already visited the
Campus.

Three to six Sociology majors
have had the opportunity to
meet the candidates at each
meal, said Ruth, and have been
responsible for raising some
excellent questions. ‘‘We put
them through the paces even
when they’re eating,”’ he re-
marked. ~

Each visiting candidate
teaches a class, said Ruth. “In
each instance we have used Dr.
Myers’ 8:00 Intro.’’

Psychology .

The Psychology Department
will bring in a new Child and
Development Psychologist to
replace retiring Professor of
Psychology Jay H. Ostwalt.

Department Chairman John
D. Kelton estimated that there
were over 100 applicants for the
job. Three candidates have
already been to the campus,
with a fourth coming next week,
he said.

Three of the candidates under
serious consideration are wo-
men. “The last years have been
unusual in not having any
women in the Psychology De-
partment,’’ said Kelton.

There were women on the
Psychology staff as early as
1950, he noted.

Students have come into
contact with the psychology
candidates, picking them up, at
the airport, inviting them to the
eating houses, and’ hearing the
professors’ colloquia.

French

The French Department has
an opening for a fourth full-time
professor. 4

Professor of French Lauren
W. Yoder explained that the
French department seeks some-
one with ‘‘near native fluency in
French, a great deal of experi:
ence abroad, and experience
leading a student group a-
broad."’

PIEDMONT INSURANCE AGENCY, INC.

GENERAL INSURANCE

If all these requirements are
filled, he added, the department
could also use a member with a
specialty in the 18th century.

There were over 100 appli- ’

cants for the position. Four
candidates have been visiting
Davidson for final considera-
tion. “At least two of these were
non-Christian,’’ said Yoder.

Student contact with an reac-
tion to candidates are of ‘‘pri-
mary importance,” remarked
Yoder.

Candidates ‘meet with the
French International Students
as well, he added.

History

Although Professor of His-
tory David Rice will be leaving,
Professor of History Malcolm
Lester stated, ‘‘We will not be
making a permanent appoint-
ment in History at this time.’’

Lester explained, ‘It’s too
late for us to enter into a
full-scale search for a new
professor. We prefer to recruit
in the fall.”

‘“‘We may have a visiting
professor; negotiations haven't
been completed. There are sev-
eral people we are in contact
with. It might well be in the
summer before we know defin-
itely.’’

Political Science ~

In the Political Science De-
partment, it is still uncertain if
Professor of Political Science
and Director of the South Asia
Program Tonia K. Devon will
be replaced this year.

Professor of Political Science
Harris Proctor stated, ‘‘We will
not take steps to replace her
until she indicates she will be
leaving. She can remain at
Davidson the rest of this year
and next year.”

Proctor added, ‘‘As far as we
know, she doesn’t plan to leave

_paper. We follow every lead.”

at the end of this year. We have
prepared the schedule for next
year on the assumption that she
will be here. We're not doing
anything right now--just wait-
ing.”

Proctor also said the main job
to be filled would be Director of
the South Asia Program.

Hiring Procedure

The building of a faculty,
from ‘the technical standpoint,
flows from the Trustees to the
President, who delegates it to
the Vice President for Academic
Affairs. He usually delegates
the responsibility to the rele-
vant department chairman.

The department chairman in-
itiates the search, puts the
advertisement in educational
journals and interviews the
candidates. He and tenured
members do the initial screen-
ing.

The chairman comes. back
with six to eight dossiers. He
then talks to the Vice President
and they decide on three or four
to invite onto campus.

The candidates are
interviewed by Spencer and
Zimmermann, and the chairman
of the relevant department. The
candidate is often asked to give
a class or presentation. On that
basis the department decides
and makes a recommendation to
the Vice President.

The ultimate responsibility
for a decision lies with the
President. It usually is the

_ person the department has re-

commended.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. commented, ‘‘Stu-
dent input is a factor. It should
not be overdone, though. The
total record is more important
than the one performance deal.

“It is a joint project. We're
trying to get the best informa-
tion possible because we want a
distinctive faculty. We don’t
accept just what we have on
