Women’s and men’s cross country began
their seasons this weekend, as the women
traveled to Boone for the Covered Bridge
Open, and the men went to Charlotte to com-
pete in the Charlotte Relays.

The women came out strong, with five fin-
ishers in the top 20 in their opening meet on
Friday.

Co-captain Brenna Burns ’08 finished sec-
ond overall in the meet, recording a time of
18:17.44 on the 5K course.

Co-captain Allie Martin ’06 came in sev-
enth with a time of 19:03.29.

The underclassmen showed great promise
in the meet, making up four out of the top
five Wildcat finishers.

Caroline Sanker ’09 came in third for the
Wildcats and 11th overall with a time of
19:19.77.

She was followed by Megal Atias ’08 and
Brittany Crawford ’08, who placed 16th and
19th, respectively.

This great performance was no surprise for
the Cats, as the team had much enthusiasm
and confidence before the meet.

Burns said, “This is definitely a great year
for Davidson cross country. We have six tal-
ented and hardworking new freshmen, who
have already contributed so much to the
team through their enthusiasm and excite-
ment.”

The Wildcats placed ahead of Coastal
Carolina, who came in third, and

The season got off to a rough start for
the volleyball team, who lost all four of

their games by a score of 3-0 at the Nike -

Portland Invitational in Oregon last
weekend.
The competition was stiff for the

’Cats (0-4), who went up against ~

worked together and ended up beating one of
our bigger rivals (ASU),” said Boone.

In a pre-season Southern Conference vote,
the women were chosen to finish third
behind Chattanooga, who placed first last
year in the SoCon, and Appalachian State.

On the men’s side, competition began on
Saturday with the Charlotte Relays at the
McAlpine-Greenway Park.

The ’Cats, who came in third, entered
three pairs of runners, with each partner run-
ning a 5K.

The host and winner of the meet, UNC-
Charlotte, posted only nine points, while the
second place finisher, Virginia Intermont,
came up with 19 points.

The men’s top team, composed of Douglas
Noreen ’07, who ran his leg in 16:16, and
captain Austin Mercadante ’06, whose per-
sonal time was 16:03, finished with a com-
bined time of 32:18.

Other Wildcat pairs included Andy Kifer
’08 and Sam Morris ’08, whose team time
was 32:51.

James Garrett 09 and Andrew Hazen ’07
ran the course in 34:51.

The best overall time for the Wildcats was
run by Lance Harden ’09, who ran alone and
finished in 15:51.

“The team entered the meet at less than
full strength,’said coach Gary Andrew.

Two of the top runners, Thad Sieracki ’09
and Jonathan Baker ’06, are recovering from
injuries.

“There are a lot of unknowns this season,”
said Mercadante, referring to the injuries
plaguing the team.

Andrew, however, has high expectations
for future meets.

The Wildcats, despite a strong effort,
still ended up losing the game and the
contest, 3-0. Liz Williamson ’07 led the
way for Davidson with 12 kills.

pitted ‘Davidson against perhaps its
toughest opponent of the entire year: the

factor depending upon how they handle the
transition to the longer collegiate race dis-
tance (8K),” said Andrew.

“IT wouldn’t be surprised if a couple of the
freshmen run in our top five at our next
meet.”

The men’s team, projected to finish sixth
in the SoCon, will compete next on Sept. 17,
in the Winthrop Invitational in Rock Hill,
S.C.

The women will be back in action on Sept.
9 and 10 when they travel to Charlottesville,
Va. to run in the Lou Onesty Invitational.
