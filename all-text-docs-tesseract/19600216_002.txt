THOU SHALT NOT
KILL.

THOU SHALT NOT
COMMIT ADULTERY.
THOU SHALT NOT

Two of the greatest paradoxes in modern history
are in evidence at the present time. The first is that
the liberal democratic tradition of the U. S., manifest in
the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution,
has been superseded by a crass materialism, symbolized
by the divinity of Gross National Product, the adoration
of creature comforts, and the desire for security, while
the socialistic materialism of Marxism has been trans-
formed into theocratic infallibility by Communist Russia.

The second paradox is that even with the emula-
tion of materialism, the US has fallen behind Russia
in many areas of national strength in the past fifteen
years. Russia has developed into the leading nation in
spece exploration, and has made remarkable strides
in medicine, education, agronomy, chemistry, and
transportation.

THOU SHALT he In the past twenty years world responsibility has

en foisted upon an immature US. Our foreign policy
LOVE THY WHITE has become a monomanical drive against communist
NEIGHBOR AS aggression on order “to give the rest of the world a
THYSELF. chance to live under democratic system.”

. in this drive for world. alliance it has been diffi-
cult for Americans to comprehend that most nations
in the world do not care about democracy. The new
nations want independence, a stable economy end
world recognition.

The lack of international understanding, the decline
of western idealism, the fanatic desire for the “good
deal’’"—all have weakened the US’s position.

Eventually the world will no longer be divided
into two armed camps. The Afro-Asian Bloc will serve
as the balance of power, or perhaps The Power.

It would be in the US’s best interest to alter its
policy and its national attitude from one of fantastic
countering of every Russian movement by developing
a concrete standard of morality to offer new nations.

Education Too Valuable To Ignore.

prejudice is almost unavoidable to a
person who was reared in the South.
But try as we have to find one, a
significant justification of a segregat-
ed Davidson is almost non-existent.

Almost a year ago, the Board of
Trustees accepted the report of a
special committee appointed to study
the problem of admitting qualified
Negro applicants to Davidson. Such
an application had been made.

THOU SHAITNOT
EAR FALSE. WITNES
THOU SHALT NOT

lf we try to discuss it with leaders
of the college, we are shushed. If we
try to discuss it with certain students,
we are met with venement oaths and
emotion. If we try to communicate
directly with the Trustees, every word
must go through the administration.

The Supreme Court had stated its
position. So had the General Assem-
bly of the Presbyterian Church of the
U. S. It was Davidson’s turn. She pro-
fessed to be a Christian, liberal arts,
edueational institution, supposedly
dedicated to “the search for truth.”
Many thought her to be a leader in
Southern education.

To be sure, this is a private insti-
tution that can admit or reject any
student it likes. But does this absolve
the college of her obligation to so-
ciety and Christian principles?) We
think not.

The result of the committee’s re-
port was the terse announcement by
the Board that “it is not in the best
interests of Davidson College to admit
Negroes at this time.” That was all.
No explanation, no reasons.

that the Trustees had squared this
stand with every moral, ethical and
intellectual consideration. As the
teaching arm of the Presbyterian
Church, Davidson seemed blissfully
unaware that the Church had taken
the diametrically opposite stand.

There is a lot missing in the cryp-
tie statement. Having stated a posi-
tion, does the Board intend to sweep
the whole mess under a convenient
carpet? What does “at this time” refer
to? This year? The’ next five years?
The next hundred years?

It is disappointing to see prejudice
sneak into the meetings of the policy-
making body of the college. This

discriminating against that applicant,
but is denying a point of view and
valuable interchange of ideas to her
Students. We fail to see the reasoning
and wisdom behind the decision to
blindfold a‘student to situations and
denying him opportunity to cope with
them. Are these means to a well-
rounded intellectual experience?

We do not deny that there are
practical aspects to be considered.
But these aspects should be the only

deterrent to Negro admission. Differ: .

ent points of view are necessary to
solve the problem, and it is for this
Teason that we urge the Trustees to
appoint a committee, including stu-
dents and faculty members, for the
purpose of discussing it.

Where Is The Bugbear?

When DAVIDSONIAN editors ask-
ed various members of the faculty and
administration for comments on the
racial question (see page one,) we
were astonished at the reaction. It
seems that the racial bugbear has
caused many individuals to turn face
to wall. If it is ignored, maybe it will
go away. We doubt it.

It is their privilege to make no
comment if they feel they can't. But
to explain this reaction by saying that
the question is not on the agenda of
the Trustees, or that a statement
would be “inappropriate” at this time
leaves something to be desired.

True, it isn’t on the agenda. We
feel, however, that it should be at
the very top. One official said that

A Giant Step

Westminster Fellowship’s meeting
with Dr. Richards tomorrow night is
another giant step in the right direc-
tion.

One of the questions we hear most
discussed is the Philosophy of Educa-
tion, with emphasis on the Faculty
Oath, the curriculum, and aspects of
a Christian education. WF is taking
the lead in establishing means where-
by students can get first hand infor-
mation on these topics. Mr. Gorrell’s
appearance was a tremendous suc-
cess, and we expect the meeting to-
morrow night to be ‘equally success-
ful.

“The Board has enough {(o do without
having to go off on a tangent on this
thing.” If this is the attitude preval-
ent among faculty and administra-
tion officials, it looks as if no problem
has a chance of emerging from the
administrative bldnket.

And we further say that no time
is “inappropriate” for discussion of

‘such a pertinent issue, no matter what

camp the speaker is in. Anyone can be
wrong, but if he is, he will certainly
not discover his error if the question
is repeatedly hushed up.

In short, we feel that only if one
opens his eyes, ears, and mouth can
a problem be solved. We hope to see
a better interchange of ideas in the
future.

Along the same line is David Rob-
inson’s seminar on the Philosophy of
Education. This informal group takes
up valuable time, but it repays it with
an even more valuable experience.

We are glad to see that students
are interested enough in these basic
questions at Davidson to actually do
something about them. It shows, we
think, a thirst for answers—ones that
cannot be found in an answer book.

The meeting tomorrow night, how-
ever, won’t do the good it can if only
a few students appear. We urge our
readers to make the most of this op-
portunity.

Independent Raps IMAC Ruling

Larry Wells

Dear Editor:

If serious issyes are to be
considered at all, they must be
considered in a serious manner:
an issue of such import as the
admission of Negroes to the
Davidson Student Body, involv-
ing both the well-being of Dav-
idson College and the peace of
Christian consciences, warrants
slightly more responsible hand-
ling than was demonstrated in
the casual and somewhat frivo-
lous “poll” which was made in
Tuesday's chapel.

It was obvious to any intelli-
gent person that the procedure
followed was worthless, and
could not possibly obtain any-
thing approaching a true and
exact revelation of student
opinion.

The slipshod affair was not
even dignified with announce-
ment or explanation from the
stage, and those who bothered
to answer the questionnaire
were, left to their own devices
in interpreting its contents.

This fs enough to disqualify
its results from any serious con-
sideration or attention.

This is not written to be
picayunish;. it is written with
an awareness of both. the grav-
ity of the issue involved and
also of the necessity for deal-

WE NEED... ‘TALL

ing with it in a responsible
manier.

No one would imagine that-
college policy will be radically
changed or finally determined
according to its results, yet
these results will certainly be
noted, especially by those who
agree with them. But the prin-
cipal danger of this poll .does
not consist in the unscientific
nature of its findings; the harm
it-will do is to confuse even
further what the real issue is:
whether Davidson College is to
determine policy on a moral
issue according to majority
vote, or in conformity with the
Law of God.

Dear Editor:

At the end of last semester
approximately fourteen fratern-
ity men decided to quit their
fraternities and asked several
of us who are Independents
about playing on Independent
athletic teams.

Since the Independents
have no system of bidding,
any man who de-pledges or
goes inactive is automatically
eligible to play for us (since
once he goes inactive he will
not play for his fraternity).

Coach -Whittle, for some rea-

NIGGERS’

son or other, suddenly became
a fiery champion of the fratern-
ity system, fearing perhaps that
everyone would suddenly desert
those shabby, ill-planned huts
the administration was so kind
to build and ‘become radical,
Bohemian Independents.

He passionately opposed such
a shocking move because it
would be absurd if the Inde-
pendents were perhaps to win
one or more of the intramural
championships. Everyone knows
that they are generally spastics,
and it would not make the fra-
ternity boys feel very good to
lose to such a group.

Of course whet the IMAC
has done is absurd and will
have to be revoked at least
by the beginning of next
year. Theoretically a man
may be in a fraternity, but
practically (and this is the
only way in which the IMAC
is concerned) he is an Inde-
pendent.

I don’t see how anyone can
justifiably stop a man from
quitting his fraternity and play-
ing for the Independents. I cer-
tainly shouldn’t think Coach
Whittle has to worry about los-
ing too many of the good old
fraternity boys to the Indepeh-
dents.

Allan Gravely.

Comments On Poll Indicate
Flippant Student Attitude

‘" just don't give a damn
what Davidson does after this
year." Thus read a comment
written by a senior on the re-
cent Davidsonian poll on the
race question.

Thirty-seven students out
of the 647 returning the poll
preferred to make their
own statements rather than
check one of the statements on
the poll. Most of the comments
were in favor of integration.

The freshman class provided
the most comments. One stu-
dent wrote: “I believe that it
would be quite foolish for Dav-
idson College to jeopordize the
standing it has attained in over
100 years of educating young
men by yielding to the cry of
‘Un-Christian,’ 1 feel that the
question is very touchy, but I'm
sure that the Presbyterian
Church has Negro Colleges as

does my denomination. I am not’

a confirmed segregationist. I
think that integration will
come, but I hope not to David-
son College."

Another commented, “4
want the Christian thing to
be done, but | don't know
what the ‘Christian thing’ is
in this situation.”

“We could use a few ‘tall

niggers’ on the basketball
team,” was one student's sug-
gestion.

Another statoment submit-

ted: “I believe thet any boy,
regardless of race or color, is’
entitled to receive a college
education, and, if his academ-
ie record is satisfactory, to
receive that education at Dav-
idson College.”

One student observed: “Has
not Davidson College already
broken down the ‘race and col-
or’ barriers referred to? For
example, Sung Kyu Kim, Mario
Acuna, ete. It is, I believe, a
matter of adherence to strict
standards regarding scholarship
and general character when
considering a student for ad-
mission. These are the only
bases necessary.”

Another student made the
following suggestion. “It ap-
pears to me the way the recent
editor seeks to make a ‘hit’
here is to twist the knife a little
harder. If you seek to have
things changed so, sir, why
don't you leave?”

The sophomore class also
managed to hand in s number
of comments. The most inter-
esting was: “We keep this
schoo! ss a rule free from
‘integration’ of women as
well as negroes. Why are we
accused of being prejudiced

against negroes who are aca-
demically qualified yshen by
merit of sex, not race, we also
keep women out? Are we
prejudiced against women?”

Another, student wrote: “I
don’t know whether or not col-
or and race lines should be re-
moved. I only wish the Trustees
would do what they feel is
morally and ethically right re-
“‘gardless of what is best for ‘the
good of Davidson.’”

Junior and senior com-
ments were scerce. Many of
these were very short com
‘ments. “Never!” “Keep ‘em
out.”

Other comments were “I be-
lieve that Davidson College
should take the leadership in
white supremacy in the New
South,”

“I didn’t come to the South
to go to school with Negroes.
I could have done that at
home.”

One student had this to say:
“I would not be interested in
sending my sons to Davidson
College if Negroes were ever
admitted.” .

Another student submitted
the following: “Society would

prevent any sort of integration.

at a social and scholastic insti-
tution that has a background of
many years“backed with Pres-
byterian tradition. The trustees.
alumni, and students would tear

this college into unreparable -

pieced—and Davidson College
as we know it now would cease
to exist except in memory. Such
is society.”

The time is approaching, aided by rapid industrialization,
immediate nationalization and the “population explo-
sion”, when the US will no longer be able to coerce and

cajole.

Such a policy, therefore, is more than a philoso-
phical tenet concerning racial equality or individual
enlightenment or self determination; it is simply sound
politics to consider the nations of the world as more
than potential enemies of Russia.

These people need initial aid, both monetary and ©
technical. (We must realize nevertheless, that this aid
will not necessarily ally these people with us; it will
only serve to help them develop their society to a degree
to support independence.) At the moment, there are few
places in the world where thorough technical training

can be attained.

The US must make its vast educational and techni-
cal resources available to these Poople. Governmental

grants, corporation, church, an

private scholarships

will be necessary to train men and women in medicine,
education, agronomy, economics, finance, and myriad
other areas. At the present time, the US is woefully

weak in this area.

We can not afford to live in the myth that newly
developing nations will automatically gravitate to the
US pole. Either we learn to rub shoulders with blacks,
yellows and whites now or they will rub our noses into
the ground in the future. We are not so superior or
chosen that we can afford world segregation.

Davidson College should consider wisely its role
as a national educational institution and as an instru-
ment for world development. The concept that “the
race problem” exists only in the southern part of the
US is fallacious, myopic and, | believe, detrimental

to the US.

Perhaps the present policy of Davidson is in its
ostrich tradition, the wisest; however, when those men
of authority at Davidson determine the college’s position
they should not only determine its effects upon white
Protestant Presbyterians now, but also upon future

whites.

Faculty Poll Reache
Trustees Tomorrow

Results of a recent faculty
poll on the Trustee Segregation
Policy will be presented to the
Board tomorrow.

The poll’s outcome has been
kept secret pending arrival of
the Trustees. but a faculty
source this week said there is
“little doubt” that a majority
of the faculty disapprove of the
Trustees’ racial ban.

One rough-estimate of the
voting set the majority at 31,
with a minority vote of 19.

Present indications are that
conservative faculty members
are dissatisfied with the poll
outcome. A petition has been
cireulated affirming the policy-
making power of the Trustees;
this petition was defeated as a
substitute resolution to the fa-

culty poll at the faculty meet-
ing.

The DAVIDSONIAN was this
week unable to find any indi-
eations that Trustee policy-mak-

ing power is in serious jeopar- .

dy: '

This would indicate that the
conservative petition is not a
proposal or a gauge of opinion,
but a subtle reminder to the
Trustees that the faculty poll
does not obligate the Board to
act.

As one faculty segregationist
put it: “We have the assurance
even now that the Trustees. not
the faculty, are the ultimate
policy-making body.”

Will the Trustees act to re-
vise or explain their stand?

On the eve of the meeting, no
one has an answer.

race rule removed. I do not see
how a Christian college can
justify such a rule,

“We have the unique oppor-
tunity to lead in a wonderful
thing. I am convinced that in-
tegration will come about and
I don't think that we ought to
postpone it indefinitely.

“I would like to stress that
this is my personal opinion. I
do not see why anybody
shouldn't express a personal
opinion for one can certainly
take a stand and still realize
that the Trustees have the final
sayso in the matter,

“This does not rule out the
individual’s freedom in express-
ing himself. If men didn't have

this right then there would not
be any progress. The status quo
would never change unless
someone was dissatisfied with it
and spoke out against it.”

Dr. Trakas, who will assume
duties as professor of Spanish
at Florida Presbyterian next
year, commented that he didn’t
believe that the new school
would have any restriction that
excluded students because of
race, creed, or color.

Dr. Satterfield of the Music
department, who will also trans-
fer to Florida Presbyterian next
year, commented that, “An ed-
ucational institution loses its
definition to the extent that it
accepts students on any other
grounds than their qualifica.
tions for learning. There is no
consistency in a church's hiring
missionaries to save colored
souls for eternal segregation.”
