xington-and if they get past this one, they may end the

in L
season with the best average in sone Years, The Generals are
doped as a conference darkhorse and are being made heavy
favorites to give the Cats the same treatment issued last year.
Another factor in favor of the Virginians is the fact that they
will be playing before a friendly Homecoming crowd. How-
ever, the Cats should net forget the way in which the same
W&L team spoiled Davidson's Homecoming last year,

For the same reason the Cats may be installed as favorites
next week as they tangle with VMI’s Keydets before the Old
Grads on Richardson Field. For our money the game would

rate asa toss-up, but the Cats gain the nod by virtue of the,

local surroundings. The Keydets last week went down before
Richmond, a team which has made a very poor showing this
year, losing to Rollins and W&L by one-sided scores, These
scores don’t always mean too much, but ip should be the Cats’
game,

As pointed out above, the Spiders from Richmond are not
the strong outfit that downed the Red and Black last vear.
This should be an easy one as should The Citadel contest in
Charleston. The Bulldogs were no match for W&M, Only one
week after the Cats held the Indians. The Citadel went to Vir-
init only to rin home stinging from a 54-0 loss, The Cats also
