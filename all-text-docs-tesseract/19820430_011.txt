frogless 20; form letter to my important people

Hello, it’s back again

from some remote time zone like pilot

pushing a button — ;
or like a pilot light in South Dakota that suddenly —
goes out

for a year, ora week, and then melts _

all the plastic in America—

like a man who disappears

and returns, impossibly, in Topeka or

a bar&grill in Idaho—

sometimes the soul can slowly vanish

and some time later reappear on the other side;
a man can grow in tunnels.

A transition might be through a slab of concrete
or it might happen in some numb creek between

frogless 22, letter continued

Re-turning from a bad note
might be like a musician,
I don’t know.

And sometimes it is hard, .being

dragged over a rainbow,

it is the unannounced jig,

unpremeditated egg roll, sudden

trillium

sprouting out of the jersey taxicab ,
that unkinks the ‘hard, being

dragged’

to reveal'a straight and wide truth,
a one-voice chord in the center of
the face.

The sudden trillium might well be
an ordinary mayapple that discov-
ers Fort Benning

and eats it, Arecibo-like.

frogless 26, some. old things happening i in re-

: v play- end of the letter
sheets of ice;
it is the change that matters:
the form never changed a thing I tried to sink my bike
the process never changed the result through anoth ied 69 orange chevy
and though a man like a quantum may tunnel with the white canvas top--

through an indefinable existence
yet the tunneling could not change the changing.

frogless 21, continuation of the let-
ter, containing rejection

A wart can be just a knob,

or a String attached toatooth; —
a frog might bé a lord, a frogless line
a tough confessional

but a rejection is a deal,

a dealer in black vinyle and stain-
less steelware _ .

and it is hard to settle with-.

just as a man will not write

a letter to the editor while the
inexplicable sock crawls between
his toes, being unready to write.

The sky falls, the sun falls,

months later the the typewriter Mew |

with rumblings that suck the mud, ... 1...

° _DAVIDSONIAN f Friday 30 April 1982.

ane AO os RB Borin.

tried to put that bastard through the right front
fender,

straight on, and out the left

with a sound like the prodigal gear

trying to come home again,

to the old dog who eats tangerines.

I wanted this, or please

at least put me over, around, under
even, but not to bounce and break.
That would have been too much. So.

With the only umph I saw in the ;
still world between my front tire and the chevy, —
I umphed and sprung.

Like a superman, or a frog,

or some boot thrown at the dog or mailman,

I went over and

into the road, not breathing.

not knowing, not knowing, ore
and plowed there for some years, '

and now, often months later,

Iam whole, yes. Sy cae & Aten
