Williams sees faculty program void

By SCOTT REID

There is no formal “faculty deve-
lopment program” at Davidson Col-
lege at this time, although Vice Pres-
ident for Development Craven Wil-
liams and others would like to see one
put together as soon as possible.

Williams, who is quick to point out
that he is not an expert on developing
the teaching skills of faculty mem-
bers, devoted a section of the Internal
Case Statement to ‘faculty develop-
ment.”

(The Internal Case Statement is the
75 page document which is the
preliminary outline of the -College’s
goals for development by 1987.
Williams is its primary author.)

In ‘outlining ‘‘a planned and sys-
tematic program of faculty develop-
ment,’’ Williams lists five activities
which could be included. The first is
an “In-Service Training for New
Teachers.”’ Second is a program by
which classroom presentations by
professors could be video-taped and

The third proposal calls for funding
of faculty research and experiment-
ation into the nature and means for
improving teaching methods.

“Funds are necessary to allow
faculty members to try new ap-
proaches whereby students might
learn easier or better,”” explains the
Internal Case Statement.

William’s fourth proposal suggests
that ‘‘at least one symposium a year”’
should be conducted ‘‘which focuses
on the role of the college professor,
the state of undergraduate education”’
and related subjects. Outside experts
would conduct much of the sym-
posium and provide consultation for
individual professors.

A Mentorship Training Program is
the fifth proposal. Its purpose would
be to develop and improve ‘‘skills in
human relationships’’ primarily bet-

ween faculty and students. It would
raise such questions as: ‘‘What kind
of relationships with students will
pr result in ee. * 7 eal

ment and growth?” and “‘What kind
of gestures reflect understanding and
instill trust in faculty-student rela-
tionships?”

Finally, the Case Statement noted
that the intellectual growth of indivi-
dual faculty members outside of the
classroom is currently promoted
through the sabbatical leave pro-
gram, and special workshops,
meetings, and seminars.

As it is set up now, the sabbatical
program provides full pay for a
faculty member to leave the college
for one term after every six years he >
or she spends here.

Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs Frontis Johnston said, ‘I wish
we had longer sabbaticals than one
term at full pay. Yet to replace a

YMCA’s own officers blame

Dean’s office establishes
assault reporting procedure

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

Four members of the college
administration met recently to
establish procedures to be
followed in the event of an
assult or theft on campus.

According to Assistant
Dean of Students Mary Lou
Dietler, she, Captain Hughes
of the Security Department,
Director of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze, and Dean
of Students Will H. Terry met
primarily to consider proced-
ures to follow in the event of
rape or assult on campus.

The group also discussed
procedures to be followed if a

others for disorganization

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Executive Editor

The Davidson YM/YWCA
has recently come under at-
tack from its own officers who
charge that the YMCA is dis-
organized. These officers ad-
mit to missing meetings or not
knowing when they are held
but somehow place the blame
on others for the YMCA’s
demise.

Much of the blame for the
disorganization and demise of
the YMCA belongs with the
makeup of Davidson College
students. At least that seems
to be the concensus of opinion
of many YMCA. officers.
Whatever the reason, disor-
ganization has taken its toll in
YMCA programs. The Step
Tutor Program is funded by
the YMCA and attracted more
than 85 students last year to
help grammar school children
in the area after school.

According to YMCA Vice
President Karl Goodhouse
however, the Step Tutor Prog-
am “‘would like very much to
be out from under the juris-
diction of the Y.”’

The YMCA is still in the
process of buying an old
Southern Seaboard Railroad
depot. So far the YMCA has
spent approximately $4000
toward this purchase. Another
$2000 remains to be paid, yet
the YMCA, in the words of
Treasurer John Jones, gets ‘‘a
speaker to come talk to us in
the depot maybe twice a
month and sponsors a lunch
there once a week.

“The decision to acquire the
depot was made 6 or 7 years
ago. If I were starting over
again I might. look hard to
determine if it was worth the
money. The thought among
preceeding YMCA cabinets
has been that it is worth the
money,”’ continued Jones.

The original plans for the
depot were never consumated.
It was to be a place that would
provide recreation for gram-
mar school students. This
responsibility has now been
taken over by the town of

theft occurs or if a suspicious
person is seen on campus.

“In the event of a rape or
assult, the police should be
called immediately. I cannot
stress this enough,’ said
Dietler. ‘‘After calling the
police, the person should go
straight to the college infirm-
ary.”’

According to Dietler, the
police will notify either her or
Terry. “One of us will meet the
student at the infirmary,’’ she
said.

“It is important that some-
one meet the individual and
make sure everything is all
right. The person should have
someone to talk to.

“Also, either Dean Terry or
I will contact the ‘student’s
parents if necessary. Some-
times a situation like this will
upset the parent more than the
student,’’ said Dietler.

The group stressed that a
description of the attacker
should be given to the police.
Besides such details as age,
hair color, eye color, height,
weight, and build, a descrip-

tion should include any dis-.

tinguishing marks or charac-
teristics.

“Watch for scars, tatoos,
eye glasses, a limp, and so
forth,’’ said Dietler. “These
details are especially helpful to
the police.’

“Also try and see if the
attacker uses a car. Remember
such things (about the car) as
color, year, make, body style,
and license number if possible.
Tell these things to the po-
lice,’’ she said.

The group emphasized that
thefts, suspicious persons on
campus or suspicious inci-
dents should be reported to
the police immediately.

According to Dietler, the
Security Department has ins-
talled six emergency phones
on campus.

One phone is in the first

floor lobby of Dana Science
Building and a second is in the
elevator in the library. The
other four are on each of the
four. floors of Watts Dormi-
tory.
“These phones should be
used only in an emergency, as
they are direct lines to the,
police department,’’ said
Dietler.
