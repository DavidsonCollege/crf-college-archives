MINISTERIAL BAND
DIRECTS VESPERS

The Y. M. C. A. vesper service, con-
ducted by the Ministerial Band, on Sun-
day evening, was a change from the usual
vesper service, in that it was entirely in
the hands of the students. No speaker
was included, and the program consisted
largely of songs, responsive readings and

prayers.

A special solo by Mrs. H. M. Moffett
was a very enjoyable feature of the meet-
ing, which was characterized by thought-
ful and earnest devoton of all the students
in attendance.

E. P. Moye, presdent of the Ministerial
Band, was in charge of the meeting, while
F. D. Miller, after some appropriate re-
marks on the “Praise of God,” read the
146th Psalm, which is a psalm of praise.
Cecil Lawrence led the responsive reading.

Juniors and Sophs
First in Basketball

As a result of the Seniors’ win last Fri-
day night over the Juniors, and the Sophs
beating the Freshmen, the interclass bas-
ketball tourney is all tied up. The Juniors
and Sophomores were leading with two
wins and one loss each, and the Seniors
and Freshmen were jointly occupying the
cellar. Both had lost two games and won

one,

Despite the fact that they are tied with
the Sophomores, the Juniors are the best
{team in the race. They played against
|the Seniors without the services of Mc-
| Gavock, their regular center. His playing

Seniors and the Freshmen for third place.

PRESS CONVENTION

dress the convention in the chapel at

Queens.

Leaving Queens, the delegates will
barely have time to make the five
o'clock picture show at the Carolina
Theatre, the management of which
theatre has offered complimentary en-
trance to the convention delegates.
The last event on Friday will be a
dinner, followed by a dance at the
Hotel Charlotte. This dinner and
dance is given with the compliments of
the Observer Printing House. Prompt-
ly at eleven, the dancing will be ter-
minated and the delegates will all re-
turn to Davidson, being again trans-
ported by the Bierman Engraving Co.
Of the business session, on Saturday
morning, the most important part will
be the discussion groups. These dis-
cussion groups are probably the most
important things of the convention in
the way of advancement. There are to
be five: annual editors, managing ed-
itors, business managers, newspaper
editors, and magazine editors. The ma-
jority of these will be entirely con-
trolled by students, although it has
seemed bést to have such ones as the
business managers, assisted by some
of the representatives of the printing
and engraving companies, present.
Julian S, Miller, the editor of the
Charlotte News has agreed to speak,

Dr. Wilson Lectures
On Edgar Allan Poe

Poe Represented as a Man of
Many Paradoxes

A paradoxical lecture on a para-
doxical man is an exact characteriza-
tion of Dr. James Southall Wilson's
speech on the personality. of Edgar
Allan Poe to the class in English 4,
Monday, October 29. It was a para-
doxical lecture because, though sym-
pathetic in every note, it was exact in
every detail; and though intellectual
in its composition, it was appealing in
its presentation.

Poe’s personality, according to Dr.
Wilson, is the most discussed, most
contradicted, and most dark of that
of any man of American literature:
a Hamlet he is to all generations, In
a few words, he was a paradox to
humanity, denying most charges made
against him, he wrote them plainly in
his life as true. All his old biographers
were moral partizans4.they took their
own idealization, or condemnation, and
around it fashioned his personality,
using the facts of his life to accom-
plish their personal ends.

At this point Dr. Wilson ran through
a sketch of Poe's life, pointing out the
circumstances which he believes had a
great influence on the personality of
the poet and author,

Having thus considered the frame,
Dr. Wilson turyédeto the picture, por-
traying the physical characteristics of
the literary artist with beauty of
touch. A contrast was made between
the man when his spirit was at rest
and when it was stirred by the fire of
opposition or of dissipation, Dr, Wil-
son stated that there is no blanket
statement which can cover with truth
Poe’s habits of drunkenness, since he
was not regular or consistent in his
drinking. Wi

Poe was characterized as an intel-
lectual aristocrat by choice. He was
also by choice a Virginian and a Dem-
ocrat; an Episcopalian by birth. A
man of immense energies, he was very
prolific in literary hack work. Gen-
erous with his money and his critical
defense of young authors such as
Hawthorne and Lowell, he was easily
fired by a seeming injustice in a criti-
cism of his own or of other’s writings.
The’ author’s best defense was pen-
ned by himself in ‘the poem, “To
Helen,” which describes physical
beauty, intellectual beauty and spirit-
ual beauty. With a powerful and
emotional reading of this poem, Dr.
Wilson closed his address.

Very few members of the student

men know exactly what the point sys-

to the effect that the point system is
a means of becoming eligible to a bid

Many Social Events |
Featuring N.C. C. P. A.

A luxurious round of entertainments
for the Press Convention here has been
provided by the courtesy of Charlotte and
local business firms. A banquet at the
Maxwell-Chambers Hotel here tonight at
8:00 o'clock begins the program. This
will be followed by a trip to the Davidson
Theater, sponsored by Stough Brothers,
where Don Terry and June Collyer are
displaying their film wares in ‘Me,.Gang-
ster.”

Tomorrow noon the delegates will be
entertained at a luncheon at the Myers
Park Club, whence they will motor to
Queens College, where they will sip tea’
for an hour with the coveted queens. At

his various duties overload him with
weight and responsibility

No man is permitted to hold two 5-
point positions, or hold positions total-
ing more than ten points. In this
way, in addition to the lessening of
responsibilities, there is a more even
division of the honors.

The point system in usage is as
follows:

President of the Student Body—s
points.

President of the Y. M.C. A—s5
points.

President of the Athletic Associa-
tion—5 points.
President of the

Senior Class —

5
points.

Editor of the “Davidsonian” — 5
points.

Editor of the “Quips and Cranks” —
5 points.

Manager of Football—s5 points.
Manager of Baseball—q points.
Manager of Basketball—4 points.
Manager of Track—4 points.
Editor of the “Chameleon”—4 points.
Business Manager of the “Davidson-
ian’—3 points.

Business Manager of
Cranks”—3 points.
Business’ Manager of the “Chame-
leon’”’—3 points.

Judge of the Court of Control—3
points.

President of the Glee Club—3 points.
This point system went into efféct
with the class of ’27, and has been in
effect ever since. As to.the reference
of the point system to O. D. K., the
fraternity has an entirely different
method of choosing its members and
the ones eligible for membership. Their
grounds for membership are weil
known to all, but their canon of mem-
bership is secret.

-Class Track
Meet Held Today

For the first time in the history of
Davidson | College athletics, a track
meet is to be held during the fall
semester. This track meet is to be
held this afternon, beginning at about
four o'clock. The meet will take the
form of interclass competition, and
keen rivalry between various classes
is expected, :

Because of the number of entrants
in the different events, it was neces-
sary to hold preliminary tryouts yes-
terday afternoon, and the winners of
these preliminaries will compete this
afternoon in the finals. Points will be
scored as follows: first place, five
points, second place three points, third
place, two points, fourth place one
point. Prizes will be awarded to the
winners ofthe first three places.

An innovation in intercla§s track
meets will be introduced this after-
noon, when novice events will be held
in the field events. These events are
open to any member of the student
body who has never won a place in a
scholastic or an intercollegiate track
meet, and prizes which are awarded
this afternon have been donated by
local and Charlotte merchants.

A similar meet will be held in the
spring before the regular track season
begins, and a cup will be awarded the
class winning the meet. One of the
big reasons for holding these class
meets is to promote student body in-
terest in track, and to assist the
coaches in uncovering prospective var-
sity material.

Inter

Sailor (after having’ met run-away hus-
band) :. “He isn’t much of.a mate.”

Another Sailor: “More like a skip-
per, I'd say.”

5:00 a special show will be given them by
the Carolina Theater, where Glenn Tryon
and Barbara Kent are suffering the usual
amorous agonies in “Lonesome ;” there is
also a Keith vaudeville number,

The last social event of the convention
will be a luncheon with special features at
the Maxwell-Chambers, Saturday at 12.
This last gaiety adjourns the meeting, and
after it the home migration will begin.
