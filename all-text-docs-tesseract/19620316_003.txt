JARMAN MAKES ALL-STATE

MORE CONGRATULATIONS to Bill Jarman, who
was recently named to the Greensboro Daily News’ col-
legiate All-State squad.

Jarman, who also made second team All-Southern
Conference this season, was one of ten outstanding col-
e players in North Carolina named to the squad,
ich did not specify a first or second team.

This year’s All-State team, which is chosen annually
by the Daily News’ sports staff, is indeed a real dream
team, which, according to Sports Editor Smith Barrier,
“would challenge any collegiate All-Star aggregation in
the country, no holds barred.”

1]
Ww

The main reason for the above statement is, of course,
big Len Chappell, the All-American giant from Wake
Forest. Another All-American, Duke’s Art Heyman, was |
also named to the squad. Incidentally, Jarman outscored |
both of these men when the Wildcats met them in the!
first two games of the season.

Other players named to the team include Larry |
Brown, North Carolina guard; Bobby Frank, Pfeiffer
center; Mel Gibson, Western Carolina guard; Russ Mar-
vel, N. C. State center; Jeff Mullins, Duke forward; Billy
Packer, Wake Forest guard; and Dave Wiedeman, Wake
Forest guard.

During the season these ten cagers all averaged
in the double figures. The average All-Stater scored 19.8
points a game, collected 9.8 rebounds per contest, hit
48.9 percent from the floor, and sank 70.4 percent of
his free throws.

In each of these departments Jarman was above
average. The big redhead junior averaged 21.4 points,
and 11.3 rebounds, and hit 51.4 percent and 73.4 percent
from the floor and free throw line, respectively.

The top performance in each of the major depart- |
ments includes the following: scoring average — Chap-|
pell, 30.7 (fourth best in the nation); rebound average — |
Frank, 18.1; field goal percentage — Gibson, 58.1; and|
free throw percentage — Packer, 80.0.

The team’s average height is 6-3 with Chappell and |
Frank being the big men at 6-8, while Packer is the|
smallest at 5-9. Once again Jarman, who stands 6-5, is|
above average.

The team has experience as only Mullins is a sopho-|
more. In addition to him, Chappell, Frank, Marvel, and
Packer are seniors, while Brown, Gibson, Heyman, Jar-|
man, and Wiedeman are juniors.

Only three home-grown boys are on the team—Jar- |
man (Gastonia), Frank (Greensboro), and Gibson (Rock-|
ingham). The other seven come from Pennsylvania (Chap- |
pell), and Packer, New York (Heyman and Brown), Ken- |
tucky (Mullins), Indiana (Marvel), and New Jersey (Wiede-
man).

AND THEY SHALL BEAT THEIR
CANNON BALLS INTO BOWLING BALLS

EVER WONDER what the ROTC instructor and staff
members do with their spare time? Do they shine their
shoes, polish their brass, clean their rifles, etc.? Some-
times, of course, but most of the time you can find them
_— at the luxurious AMF bowling Lanes in Concord,

at.

On Wednesday nights several men from our ROTC
department, including Col. Wheaton, Capt. Hampton,
Sgt. Crump, Sgt. MacCurry, and Sgt. Gregory, participate
as a team in a bowling league in Concord. And they’re
pretty successful. They won the first half championship
this season, and are now vying for the second half crown.
The league champion will be decided by a playoff be-
tween the first and second half winners.

Pacing the attack of the Davidson military experts,
who are defending champions of the league, is Sgt. Gre-
gory. Gregory, who usually bowls about 170, once rolled
a score of 254.

Two Cheerleaders | ‘
To Be Elected Soon|

Under a new procedure
adopted by the Student
Council, any student wish-
ing to become a candidate
for cheerleader must file
his name with Joe Martin,
head cheerleader, by Wed-
nesday, March 21.

Martin indicated that at least
two positions will be open for
next year.

The new procedure provides
that election will be permanent,
and that vacancies created by
graduation and drop-outs will be
filled by student body elections.
In a separate vote, the Council
ruled that service during 1961-
62 should be considered equal
to permanent election.

The number of cheerleaders
will be maintained at ten, with |
each class being represented |
by at least two men. To com- |
ply with this rule, one of the
men to be elected this year must
be a rising junior.

A slate of candidates recom

be presented to the student

body after spring holidays. This
group will be chosen from those
men who file with Martin by
Wednesday.

Martin's room is 403 East.

Five School Records Fall
As ‘Catfish Finish Fourth

BY CHARLIE SHAPARD
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Coming back strong on the final day of the meet,
the Davidson College swimming team jumped from last
place to fourth in the Southern Conference meet last
weekend in Charleston, S. C.

VMI swept the three-day
event by edging out VPI by two
points, 98-96. The Citadel plac-
ed third, Davidson fourth, Wil-
liam & Mary fifth, and West
Virginia sixth.

Although the ‘Catfish did

not have any first place finish-
es, five Davidson school rec-
ords were broken.

Placing second in the 400-yd.
medley relay, the Davidson team
of Tom French, Stefan Young,

, Jack Hollenbeck, and Barry

Branch broke the existing school
record by four seconds with a
time of 4:07.8.

In the 50-yd. freestyle, Hol-
lenbeck, who finished fourth,
and Branch, who placed fifth,
both felled the school mark of

respectively.

Branch also broke the
school record in the 100-yd.
freestyle by placing fourth
with a time of 52.9 seconds.

French broke the — school
record in the 200-yd. backstroke
by two seconds with a time of
2:17.9 while placing fourth in
the event.

Qualifying second in the 100-
yd. backstroke with a swift time
of 1:00.2, French dropped to
fourth in the finals.

In the 100-yd. butterfly,
Hollenbeck placed third with
a time of 59.7, bettering the
efforts of any previous Dav-
idson swimmer.

Young placed fourth in the
100-yd. breaststroke with a time
of 1:10.2, and was just touched
out by the VMI breaststroke for
third.

The freestyle relay, consist-
ing of Carter, Mebane, Bill Am-
brose, Mike Weeks, and Bill
Whittington, took a fourth
place.

STEVENS and CAPTAIN HARRY CLINE. Action will begin at 1:30 p.m. on the local diamond. The
game will be the first of a 28-game schedule for this year’s baseball squad, which is co-favored
with West Virginia to win the Southern Conference. (Staff Photo by McCutchen)

Fast breaking at every
opportunity, the talented
Kappa Sig cagers set what
is probably an I-F basketball
record Wednesday after-
noon by pouring in 105
points against the Sig Eps in
a convincing 105-29 win.

With eleven straight wins un
der their belts, the Sigs have
mathematically clinched _ this
year’s I-F cage championship
and need only to beat the Sigma
Chis to complete an undefeated
season.

Meanwhile the Phi Gams vir-
tually clinched second — place
this week with wins over the
Sig Eps and Pikas.

This week's LF checklist in
cludes the following:

MONDAY

The Phi Gams, playing with-
out their usual first five, clip
ped the Sig Eps, 60-41, Dickie
Fulp paced the Fiji attack with
19 points, while freshman John

Lehman scored 12 for the Sig|~

Eps.

Toney McMillan scored 20 and
Ed Hines 16 as the SAE's edged
the Sigma Chis, 49-47.

The ATO's clobbered the Sig-
ma Nus, 63-23, behind Paul
Duvall’s 24 points. Freshman
Arthur Clark had 13 for the
Nus.

TUESDAY

The Kappa Sigs pulled away
from the Phi Delts in the second
half behind the guard play of
Johnny Rogers (22) and Jimmy
Hendrix (10) for a 52-36 win.

Paced by Tommy Hamilton’s
14 points, the Betas fourth quar-
ter rally fell short as they fell
to the KA’s, 42-39. Rick Smyre
and John Sharp led the KA’s
with 11 each.

Pfeiffer Tomorrow

The baseball team opens its
1962 slate tomorrow afternoon
at 1:30 in a home stand against
Pfeiffer College.

The game, which will be the
first of -28 for this year's nine,
will be an exhibition-type con-
test since both Coach Tom
Stevens and the Pfeiffer coach
plan to use three or four pit-
chers and to substitute freely.

GOOD GAME

However, Stevens did predict
a good game. Said the Wildcat
mentor, “We've always had
good games with them. Last
year we split two games with
them—they won one by 5-4, and
we won the other by 5-4.”

Experienced and confident
, the Wildcats are out to better
‘last year’s 10-13 overall record
and 66 conference mark. With
every reguiar returning except
third baseman Russ Cotton, plus
some excellent sophomore help,
the 'Cats have been ranked as
high as co-favorite with West
Virginia in the Southern Con
ference.
