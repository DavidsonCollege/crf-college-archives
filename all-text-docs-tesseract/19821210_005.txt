Endowment

Grows

The endowment of Davidson Col-
lege has passed the $30 million mark,
acording to an announcement by David-
son College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

Spencer noted that Davidson’s en-
dowment was just over $1 million in
1941, at the start of World War II. It
pased the $2 million mark in 1951, $5
million in 1958, $10 million in 1966,
and $20 million in 1978.

A 1981 study by the National Asso-
ciation of College and University Busi-
ness Officers ranks Davidson 30th
among the nation’s liberal arts colleges
in terms of the value of endowment.
Dartmouth leads the list, with an en-
dowment of $234,055,000, more than
$100 million above second-place Wel-
lesley.

International
Food Fest Held

By MIKE TANTILLO ’85

The International Festival, featur-
ing representative food and music from
over a dozen countries, invaded the
Union Patio last Saturday.

About 75-100 students sampled the
various foods. Sophomore Edwin
Evans said, “The food is incredible; it

gives my tastebuds a new, international
perspective. I would like to see more
things along these lines.” Senior Trig
Adams said, “It was all wonderful. We
try to get foreign students incorporated
into our society, but we don’t really doa
lot to understand foreign cultures, so
things like this are a good idea.”

Geoff Andrews, a dual citizen of the
United States and the Bahamas, brought
back conchols and conch fritters that his
mother made during Thanksgiving
break. Maria Nicolaides fixed baklava,
a Greek dessert. Shirin Hanafi and Am-
breen Fraser served semose, a Pakistani
snack. Fraser said, “The festival was
really good, watching all the people was
very interesting, and a lot of my friends
got involved in helping make the food.”

Laura Terry, who made and served
French crépes, said, “The festival went
really well. I’m glad we were able to
have it outside—that way a lot of people
saw it and just wandered over.”

Andres Sanz, who served a Spanish
potato omelette, said, “The Internation-
al Festival is a good idea, but food is not
enough. In the spring festival, we
should also try and have dancing and

games.”

Yu Chienwen, from China, served -

egg rolls made with shrimp and vegeta-
bles. Chiewen said, “The Festival was a
good chance for a cultural exchange and
to intermingle with the American stu-
dents. Things like this help bring us
closer to the American students.” David
Taylor, who was JYA at St. Andrews
last year, added shortcake from Sco-
tland.

Charitable and Educational Fund of
Jacksonville, Fla., has granted David-

mons for Mrs. duPont.

lass of ’83
lans Gift

a’

By ANN MEADOR ’85

The Class of 1983 has decided on a
gift for Davidson.

According to Class President Sher-
burne Laughlin, a pledge of $100,000 to
be used for scholarships will be present-
ed to the College at next spring’s gra-
duation ceremonies.

To reach this goal, the class will

campaign among its members, asking

for individual pledges of one percent of
each member’s gross adjusted income
for the five years following graduation.
Laughlin said they hope to achieve 100
percent participation from the class.

The class will present a check for
$100,000 to Davidson at its fifth reun-
ion. The money will be used to augment
the financial aid packages of students
who have already received some finan-
cial aid.

The presentation of the class gift
will coincide with the sesquecentennial
of the College.

$78,226 already pledged in SGA Phonathon
Davidson on the line

By THURSTON HATCHER ’85

With one night still remaining, the
combined efforts of the SGA, the
Development Office, and over 400 Da-
vidson students have led to $78,226 in
total pledges from the third annual SGA
Phonathon.

Last year the Phonathon produced
$127,000 in total pledges and $140,000
in actual donations. Lee McCormick,
co-chairman with Ken Krieg and
McNair Helm, says that this year’s Pho-
nathon is running about even with last
year, in spite of the economy. One ma-
jor accomplishment is the gaining of 10
percent more donors every night.

For the first time, the Phonathon
staff used computers this year to help
with the extensive tabluations and
cross-references. Problems persisted
with the computer programs for the first

few days, but, says McCormick, “after
a little work we got it running smooth-
ly.”

According to McCormick, the Pho-
nathon was initated three years ago with
a threefold purpose. The major reason is
to increase totals of gifts and new do-
nors. A second reason is to help estab-
lish rapport between students past and
present. Finally, the activity helps vo-
lunteering students and the alumni who
are phoned realize the importance of
giving and keeping the living endow-
ment strong.

McCormick estimates that the 1982
Phonathon will contact over 2,000
alumni and parents of current students
before it ends.

The Phonathon Staff wants to thank
all students from the various participat-
ing houses, fraternities, and organiza-
tions. Night totals are as follows:

PiKA: $15,877
PAX/Emanon: $7,095
Rusk/Warner Hall: $10,643
KA: $9,255

Andrew Wilson and John Lyday pretend to phone someone.

ETC/Sig Ep/ATO: $10,613

Fiji/F & M: 16,786

SAE: 7,957

Phi Delt and the BSC will call tonight.
