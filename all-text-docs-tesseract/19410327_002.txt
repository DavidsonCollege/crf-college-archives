Letters to

the Editor

On The Davidsonian.
Dear ‘Tony:

There has been some discussion
recently among various members of
the student body as to what most
needs to be improved in the David-
sonian, and the major improvement
seems to be needed in the columns
and articles. Apparently
the contributors have gone “type”
mad. Of the three features pertain-
ing to Davidson students in last
week's issue of the paper, two of
them exhibited the big fault of the
current Davidsonian features: cuss-
ing and discussing students, dates
‘and what have you according to
types. One feature took up the
three types of dates that boys have
down for dances:.the “one and
only,” the “potential lock,” and the
relative or friend. The other fea-
ture grouped Davidson studefits ac-
cording to the greeting ‘they give
to fellow. students on the campus,
but the time worn grooves were en-
tered when writer typed the boys
as being either BMOC's, timid fel-
lows, or studs. In the dirt column,
types were avoided, but not so a
plan of four parts governing the
remedy of a “grave social  injus-
tice.” The type, however, reared
its ugly head in the COMPASSING
CAMPUSES column in the treat-
ment of the “flush” wires. It all
added up to the readers of our
weekly paper heing submitted to a
barrage of broad and perhaps inac-
Ctirate generalizations which, in the
main, had been swallowed time and
time again by readers of previous
issues.

The column which Cauble has is,
to my mind, the only part of the pa-
per which is entitled to the use of

feature

“

“types.” This column is of such a
nature that generalizations are ex-
pected. Cauble did a plenty good

job this year with clever and ironic |

discussions of collegiate suberfuges
and foibles; when he was good, he
was very good,—in fact, usually the
best thing in the paper—and when
he was bad, he was no worse than
anyone else in the particular issue.
Whoever takes over his column for
the coming year should likewise be
allowed to use the “type” system,
if he does not overdo it or repeat
what has been said before.

The feature stories should try to
demonstrate more originality and
less repetition of the “type” system
of hackneyed Davidsonese, namely,
such local and overworked words
as “cut,” “mish,” “limber,” “flush,”
and “wild hair.” If there is nothing
new to. be said in. a feature, why
write one anyway? And if there
is something new to be written, then
the writers should. use their gray.
matter more and their stray patter
less. As to the dirt dopester, here's
hoping he will avoid using the
names of the same two or three
“big operators” in every other para-
graph of every column he writes
during the year. There must be
other Davidsonianites whose escap-
ades are also worthy of dishonor-
able mention. The dirt column
writer can also do without using
type A, type B, type C, and ad
infinitum in his column.

These are the chief criticisms
that have been mentioned. The Da-
vidsonian has been fine this year.
Yet there's no reason why it can’t
be even finer next year.

Yours for a, bigger
Davidsonian,

AN INTERESTED SENIOR.

On Stapling Ballots

Dear Tony:

In line with Mr. Dale's editorials,
I wish to voice an opinion heartily
favor the . stapled ballots,
which keep the identities of the
voters secret; there“are also a few
suggestions I would like to make.
The aim of the secret ballot system
is that each voter feels free to vote
as he desires without his selections

in of

being known to anyone else besides |

a few pledged persons, who tally
the votes. The only reason that the
name of the person is heeded is to
prevent absentee balloting and the
“stuffing of the ballot-box;” check-
ing for suspected “combines’’ may
also be needed. But the checking-
off of each voter from a list makes
further identification

sary, unless an investigation is con- |

ducted,

The stapled ballots could
opened under such a condition,
The present open-faced ballot would

be adequate if members of the
Elections Board safeguarded their
| confidences as well as they are

pledged to, but the odds are against
such a consistently sécretive com-

mittee

The stapled-ballot system would
only {ncur the expense of -the
stapling machines and perhaps

slightly longer ballots, so that the
folded bottoms would not lap over
the list of candidates. The only re-
sulting trouble would be negligible
to outline the simple plan to the
students, and in keeping with the
two or four machines in good work-
ing condition.

As an amendment to this plan, if
there is needed any check-up as to
fraternity combines or “swings,” I
suggest that each person be re-

|quired to state his fraternity or else

ON SPRING HOLIDAYS: |

That much chronicled and long
awaited holiday season for which
the spring-feverish collegian has

yearned is at last upon us.

The peculiar attractiveness of a
seven-day recess at this time ob-
viously includes more than a mere
suspension of academig, work.

Let us then consider ‘the motives,
wishes, and desires of the average
undergrad in regard to this partic-
ular matter.

In the first place, the date has an
economic effect on the senior class
that ‘4Il-ers can now navigate
their machines on paved roads in-
stead of being forced to frequent
the muddy and rutted hidden by-
roads. This practically
wash jobs altogether.

Thus legal cars for ‘seniors after
the holidays is a potent motive al-
though it might be called a minority
wish in that it affects directly only

one class.
A second goal-set for his holiday
period is the wanderlust which

legian with the coming of spring.

ami, Havana, and Nassau , must

Phe fact that this .0009 per cent

This is a decidedly potent factor in
motivating all, bat as a 100 per

a minority.

On the other side of the fence are
those’ who are violently opposed
to the spring recess—at least to
this particular one. This group in-
cludes those who are required to
take deferred exams and re-exams
in order to toss their hats into the
B. Av ring.

diploma in this manner must indeed
