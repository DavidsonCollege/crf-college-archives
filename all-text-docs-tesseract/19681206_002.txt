The Mess Hall Affair

Something about the Union cafe:
teria situation is fishier than last
Friday’s menu.

In the first place. although just
about everybody concerned is worked
up over the 71 rating that haven of
culinary delights received last month.
nobody seems to know precisely whom
to blame for it.

And in the second place. if the
Student Life Committee hadn’t just
happened on the scene, it’s not at all
unlikely that the college would have
done the usual in meeting the prob-
lem—i.e., practically nothing.

Even now there’s still a possibility
of another cover-up job, for the Stu-
dent Life Committee, after hearing out
Slater Manager Klaus Kleeberg and
Business Manager Robert A. Currie
the other day, exerted itself positive-
ly enough to recommend only another
in a long line of committees for this.
that and the other.

Of course, the proposed committee
—to be composed of several meal
ticket holders—can help the situation
considerably. If the Slater manage-
ment does meet with that committee
regularly, as it has promised to do,
grievances should at least get an
airing.

Up to now. unfortunately, legiti-
mate grieving has been a waste of
time. A few weeks back a Food Ser-
vice Committee formed by the Union
Board came out with a detailed re-
port itemizing good features and un-
satisfactory ones in the cafeteria and
made some recommendations for im-
provement.

That Ant

One of the more mundane irrita-
tions now afflicting Davidson students
comes in the form of an ant infesta-
tion in some of the dormitories.

The ant plague, centered in Watts
but reportedly moving rapidly into
Little and Belk, is accompanied by an
onslaught of cockroaches and occas-
ional other assorted vermin.

Few things are more disconcerting
than to open one’s drawer in the
morning and take out a pair of ant-
covered underwear. The current breed
of small ants particularly prefer desks,
underwear drawers, lavatories and
commode lids, though they occasion-
ally slip into beds and other areas.

Dorm residents report that although
the custodians periodically spray the
insects, it only reduces the ants’ ac-
tivity for about two days, when they
return, like the swallows coming back
to Capistrano.

The ant infestation is nothing new.
It is only one of a number of prob-
lems in those living quarters — that
would be considered undesirable in
any urban slum.

For anyone who has never been
inside a Davidson College dormitory,
it is an experience similar to entering
a tenement in Spanish Harlem.

The dorms are all designed on the
floor plan of a stable, with the excep-
tion of Duke. There are lobbies only
in Belk, Little and Richardson.

Not surprisingly, the social center
of every hall is the bathroom. Even

A month before the health inspec-
tors hit the cafeteria with its cele-
brated “C,” the committee was re-
porting bandaids, insects, pills and
hairs in the food (reports of the dis-
covery of a mouse’s tail could not be
confirmed). It was bemoaning menu
monotony. price discrepancies and the
demise of the popular snack bar. And
it was recommending. among other
things. clarification of the college’s
responsibility in supervision and
evaluation, posting of menus, special
meals and more variety.

But not only were the committee’s
offerings not taken to heart, thev
were also apparently not even read
hv some of those to whom they were
directed.

There are a number of other
bothersome questions as well. Like.
how can the food service that calls
itself “America’s most experienced
dining service’ explain away an in-
excusable health rating? Or, again.
how can the college explain the
$10,000 profit the annual treasurer’s
report says it made on the cafeteria
last year (with an operative snack
bar)?

What is needed is a little less pussy-
footing around and a lot more direct
action. The college is responsible;
Slater only provides the management.
What is needed is direct supervision
on a regular basis—and if the admin-
istration can’t do it, we’re willing to
bet students could handle it.

Otherwise, the next time the health
inspectors come calling, the “71 Club”
just might flunk its exam.

Infestation

ANTS

this effort at facilitating social inter-
action was thwarted in the newer dor-
mitories, which have two bathrooms,
one at each end of the hall. In the
older dormitories a small central bath-
room serves as meeting area and in-
formal lounge.

The rooms are for the most part
square—in fact, entirely square.

There is no ready or even remote
answer to general complaint about
students housing now. But the plague
of ants does seem unnecessary. They
are not pleasant bedfellows.

Boosting The Board

With all due respect for its recent
victory, football is not the only area in
which Vanderbilt is making progress.
The Vandy Board of Trust recently
amended its bylaws to allow recent
graduates of its undergraduate school
to serve as full voting members of
the board. A member of the current
senior class will serve four years on
the board beginning next fall.

The purpose of the change, in the
words of Chancellor Alexander Heard,
is “to bring the viewpoints of recent
students to the deliberations of the
board, to forward the knowledge of
young alumni concerning the univer-
sity, and encourage their participation
in its activities and service.”

The board is simply raising its mem-
bership by four members to allow four
young graduates, who have no other
connection with the university than
as alumni, to serve four-year terms
on the board. These men will be elect-
ed by the members of their own class
and the two classes which preceded
them in graduation.

Since we've heard talk that the

method of electing trustees at David-
son may be re-examined in the near
future. we hope that our own trustees
will consider making such a progres-
sive and practical change.

Such a move would recognize the
substantial contributions which such
men can make to the understanding
of student affairs at Davidson and to
the ways in which the educational pro-
grams of the college can be improved.
A similar recognition has occurred by
the appointment of students to faculty
committees, where students have al-
ready made some valuable contribu-
tions.

Probably most significant, though,
would be the enthusiasm which young
graduates would bring to the board.
It would be an honor to be elected a
trustee, and those elected would. un-
doubtedly feel a compelling obliga-
tion to make a significant contribution.

Besides, if progressive educators
like Terry Sanford advocate appoint-

ing young men to high government.

positions, we feel the Board of Trus-
tees certainly ought to consider having
some young men in its ranks, too.

Students Will Chase
Any Beautiful Face

By DAVID SWEATT
Managing Editor

While students continue to
ery crododiie tears over the
dearth of female companion-
ship in the Davidson envir-
ons, there appear to be some
prospects for a more shape-
ly future around the old col-
lege.

No steps have been taken
toward any permanent resid-
ency of the fairer creatures
here, despite the train of
“lets-get-'em-now’’ editorials
in THE DAVIDSONIAN's
columns and the pleas of
passion-starved students.

Despite reports of an over.
whelming persistence of no
minds at the University of
North Carolina, Charlotte.
that school now has a num.
“ber of local lasses on its
rolls and with the opening
of dormitories on campus
next year the prospects for
a better selection are good
indeed.

Besides, Davidson men
have not always shown
themselves completely dis.
satisfied with young women
outside the nation’s intellec-
tual elite. Davidson cars
have plied the road to Queens
for many years now.

And for the foreseeable
future the road to the sacred
altar of Aphrodite appears
to be paved with the same
old asphalt.

Yet with the coming of the
predicted bonanza at UNC-C,
comes also a new access to
what could prove to be a
major source of heavenly
terrestrial bodies for future
generations of Davidson stu.
dents,

Construction of a road
from the UNC-C campus on
1-85 to Mallard Creek Road
was to begin early last
month. The two-lane artery
to be widened to four, may
carry the lifeblood of David-
son's future social life.

The road won't be com
pleted before some time in
1969 or 1970, but a visit to
the new girls’ dorms early
next fall may show the new
access route to be just that.

Another possible avenue,
one almost completely unex-
plored to date, is Central
Piedmont or UCLA (Univ.
ersity of Charlotte Lizbeth
Avenue) to you locals.

school,

I¢’s worth a check. Some
of the girls aren't bad at all
and are a little more down
to earth than their cool
“‘what's-your-major’’
counterparts.

Another nearby school de-
serves attention is South
Carolina's Winthrop College
in Rock Hill, Surprising as it
may seem, Davidson is the
closest men's college’ to this
concentration of several
thousand belles —- mostly
Southern.

It’s a mixed bag and blind
dates are not scorned. Ex-
perience has proven that
such encounters can be most
satisfactory.

But this enlightened search
for the scented creatures is
not the only means to a
better social life. Another is
obviously to improve the
functions planned for the
times when the lovelies are
here on campus.

Students at Amherst re-
cently staged a sort of ‘tap.
in’ during a Sunday after-
noon open house. With girls
from nearby Holyoke, a
volleyball net, a football and
three frisbees, the half keg
went down smoothly to the
strains of Bob Dylan.

Many students at Amherst,
Mount Holyoke and Smith
said they missed the casual
friends of the opposite sex
they once had. So they tried
this.

“No one was jumping up
and down with wild enthus-
jasm, and no tears were shed
when the girls left,’ report-
ed The Amherst Student,
“but comments indicated
that an afternoon of sitting
around and talking was a
pleasant but all too infre-
quent change of pace."’

The advent of keg parties
at the fraternity houses here
has brought a little more
casuality to this campus, but
with the recent rules changes
inventive social chairmen in
fraternities and at the Union
should be able to come up
with more variety than has
been possible under the old
two-concert - two - rock-party
routine for big weekends and
the rather drab offerings of
little weekends.

“Jt must be that they're
all so smart or something,”
puzzled a girl from a nearby
college after having spent
only one evening on the

Davidson social circuit and
vowing great hesitancy at
the thought of returning.

How about a little imagi-
nation?

while eating his dinner.

If that enterprise doesn't work, maybe someone
would like to cover the thousands of ants who call
the Union home with chocolate and export them to
Europe: Rats are considered a delicacy in parts of
Africa. and surely there should be a few of the furry
little creatures hiding somewhere in that place.

Several were found in the cafeteria two years ago.
which incidentally was the last time Slater promised
to clean up the facility.

Pretty soon people won't know whether those
signs reading “UCH” refer to Union Coffee House.
or are merely expletives uttered by a man who’d
rather get his penicillin by injection than on his bread.

Maybe the best plan might be to make the kitchen
a science laboratory, featuring rare samples of mold,
insects, mice and assorted grunge. And for food, well,
there’s always Mrs. Copeland’s.

But what makes the cafeteria situation so bad is
that the criticism has been voiced for at least five
years. Probably longer. Years ago in Summer school
the manager told us the egg and peanut butter caked
on the silverware were “calcium deposits from the
water.” You bet.

Then there was the time some irate Independents
dragged a certain member of the administration down
to the lunch lines for a demonstration of the fact that
Australian aborigines aren't the only people who eat

dirt. .

Or the “stomach disorders” which weren't food

oisoning, but that struck only those who ate at the
inion.

If the college is so interested in making the
Union the great ecumenical force on campus, one
would think officials would want to make the cafe-
teria and snack bar facilities appealing to students
rather than other life forms. The Christian Commit-
ment doesn’t mean we have to establish an insect
sanctuary.

But until someone in authority gets interested
in the situation, the mold and grime are safe. It ap-
pears that the fraternity curfew isn’t the only issue
some people are indifferent toward.

Students And Educators
Approve Of Coeducation

By College Press Service
Although the place of the
sexually segregated college
has been questioned since

Winter Frolics

women literally and sym.
bolically began» wearing
pants, this year’s coeduca-
tion advocates have some

rather impressive support.

Recently at Princeton Uni-
versity a committee complet-
ed an in-depth study of the
merits of coeducation. The
committee concluded that a
male-female education pro-
gram would ‘‘greatly enrich
the cultural and social life
of (Princeton) students and
would tend to develop in
undergraduates (of opposite
sexes) a sense of responsi
bility toward one another.”

Although the study was
compiled for use at Prince-
ton. it has served as a model
for other colleges. both male
and female, who on the
strength of their own find-
ings have initiated coeduca
tional programs.

The increasing interest in
coeducation (among those
who don’t take it for grant-
ed) is due not only to the
advancing position of women
in the world, but is also a
response to the cry for uni-
versity reform.

The thrust of the ‘student
movement” has been to im-
plement social change
through relevant education.
In many cases reform has
. been directed toward trans-

school is located.

Such an academic com-
munity would most of all be
diverse — an exchange mar
ket for ideas and points of
view. One of the most ob-
vious sins against this educa-
i, tional model is the exclusion

of the opposite sex. Accord

ing to the Princeton survey.

the sexually segregated ar-

rangement ‘‘tends to encour-
iS age the view that intellec-
tual activity and the opposite
sex are incompatible.”’

Solutions to the coeduca-
tional dilemma have been
many. The three primary
plans are the multi-college
exchange program, the co-
ordinate college plan and
total coeducation.
