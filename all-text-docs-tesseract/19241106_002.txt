The Kick-Off

By Don Wharton

As Home-Coming Day on November 15th
‘approaches with the first home game with
Carolina in 25 years to be the feature, the
‘old grads and alumni will return to gather
about in groups before the fires and in the
stands and talk of the great Wildcat plays
and famous Davidson games that have passed
into the annals of sport history.

But great as they may have been and spec-
tacular as they certainly seemed, none will
exceed and few will equal the spirited come-
back and the wonderful attack that the fight-
ing team of Wildcats sprang Saturday aft-
ernoon before a holiday crowd of Pinehurst

lack of weight. The teams they have played
this season average around 15 pounds more
than the Wildeats, but they have been seen
fighting in every play that has been run and
using their heads, thereby getting creditable
results.

The Clemson team will average approxi-
mately 14 pounds more to the man than the
Davidsonians, and have a drive that is hard
to stop. They have some dangerous men in
the backfleld,, Robinson and) Harmon, and
Holohan shows up well at right tackle.

The Tigers have an advantage in previous
scores. In the games played between these
institutions Clemson has won seven, while
Davidson has won four and three of them
ended in a tie. The South Carolina Aggies
won last year by a 12-0 score.

With the Tigers engaging Wildcats on
hostile terms there is sure to be fur flying
around Wearn Field when they meet, and one
of the best games of the season in this see-
tion of the state is expected.

they today speak of the Red and Black team.
Out of the years of defeat and gloom they
have brought the college into one of success.

They still have a hard row to hoe, as the
Clemson, Carolina and Trinity games come
in quick succession. Behind them must stand
the undivided support and encouragement of
every man,

Saturday Davidson plays Clemson for the
first time in Charlotte since back in 1917,
when Davidson won on Wearn Field 21-9.
Last year the Tigers won from Davidson
12-0 hy two blocked punts.

They have a good team down. there this
season, ‘defeating Elon 60-0 and holding Au-
burn to one touchdown and two field goals.
Many who saw the Tiger-Gamecock fray
said that the Clemson team outplayed the
University though it lost three to nothing.

The team must be better than North Caro-
lina since the Tar-Heels were never able to
get near the South Carolina goal Saturday,
getting their score on a blocked punt.

Except for the one time when tricked at
Pinehurst, the Davidson team has not been
penalized in the last two games.

As a State player in his dressing room ex-
amined a bruised shoulder, he said: » “Look
where those — Wildeats scratched me.”

Charlie says that when the news was wired
to Davidson that Laird had kicked a’ field
goal, he threw a rooster into the Wildcat

bucked it over on the fourth down and kicked
goal,

In the last minutes of the first half Grey
booted the ball for a perfect goal from the
38-yard line while Wilson held the ball.

The second half was all) mediocre foot-
ball in which both teams would break loose
with good gains but neither side did any
consistent gaining and few first downs were
made, Both teams attempted a great many
passes, completing only a few.

Trinity completed a long pass for 30
yards across the goal line, but this was call-
ed back because one of the Trinity men was
offside.

Buster Swift, Trinity captain and quar-
terback, showed up well, bearing the brunt
of the offensive and defensive work.  Ste-
vens and Kelly showed up well on their line
also, For the Wildkittens, Grey, captain
and half-back, did some pretty punting and
running, also showing up well in his de-
fensive work. Wilson, quarterback, played
a steady, cool game and ran his team well.
Ritchie, at tackle, played a fine game, often
getting the Red Devils behind the line of
scrimmage; he also blocked one of their
punts. Arrowood played a fine game at end
