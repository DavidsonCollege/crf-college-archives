Council settles social polic y

By SHERI GRAVETT
Staff Writer

The Advisory Council on
Campus and Religious Life
(CCRL) in a meeting this week
approved a proposal dealing
with the scheduling of social
events during the week.

This proposal will now be
sent to College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. for his
approval.

Experiential programs offer
expansion in education

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer

Director of Experiential
Programs and Life/Work
Planning Ken Woods
describes the role of his office
as one of helping ‘‘students
find off-campus experiences
that still contribute to their
personal growth and develop-
ment.”

This program can provide
students with the opportunity
to gain exposure to other
cultures, reflect on personal

interests, values, and goals,
investigate career possibil-

ities, ahd to discover and test
skills.
“My job,”’ says Wood, ‘“‘is

to help students clarify what
their interests are, and then to
help them find the experience
that fits.”

He stresses that '’students
need to begin from within to
find out where their enthu-
siasm and energy is focused.”

Once this focus has been
considered, the student is free
to work with the office to
develop a plan specifically
adapted to his individual
needs.

One of the opportunities
available to students is parti-
cipation in a career service
program. A student chooses a
career option that interests
him and designs a program
which will enable him to gain
some experience working in
that area.

These internships can last
from one term to an entire
year. During this time the
student is regist#red as a

career service student and is
guaranteed a place at David-
son when he returns. It is
possible to receive academic
credit for such work experien-
ces.

This year there are six
Davidson students serving in-
ternships as teachers in Ken-
ya.

It is also possible to partici-
pate in part-time internships
in Charlotte. In this case a
student would remain at Da-
vidson and take two or three
courses in addition to working
in a county government de-
partment, law office, coun-
seling service, or any enter-
prise he chooses.

An extern program has been
designed to allow students to
explore career interests on a
short term basis. For up to one
week students are exposed to a
particular vocation or setting
to observe and learn more
about that particular career.

According to Wood, many
Davidson students have esta-
blished valuable contacts
while participating in pro-
grams of this sort and have
received job offers as a result.

To become involved in an
extern program, a student
chooses his job and location
preferences. Wood then makes
the necessary contacts whith
alumni and other friends of the
college who are connected with
the student’s occupational
choice, and sets up the extern-
ship.

These externships usually
take place during Spring

Break, although they can be

set up for any time a student
feels he can spare a week.

The Office is currently
working.on a program that
would be connected with the
Outward Bound school. De-
signed as a summer program
for rising sophomores and
juniors, this would involve,
according to Wood, nine days
to two weeks of intensive
outdoor pursuit dealing with
the question of ‘What now?’.”’

Several times during the
year Wood takes a group of
students to the Appalachian
Mountains to observe and talk
with the people in the medical
field who approach their work
with a humanistic, outlook
and a genuine concern for
people.

Every term a centering-
Venturing workshop is offered
to sophomores, juniors, and
seniors. The purpose of this
program is to help each stu-
dent match: his particular
strengths, abilities, lifestyle,
self-attitude, and values with
his concept of the types of
people he’d like to work with,
the environment he’d prefer to
live in, and the world problems
he feels need attention.

Having arrived at some
basic decisions, the student
then considers the ways in
which he could go about
achieving his goals.

A Centering- Venturing
workbook consisting of ques-
tions, exercises, and informa-
tion is used in the workshop.
This fall the.second edition is
being printed and is available
free for all those participating
in the workshop, Other stu-
dents may pugchase it for
$1.00.

Wood emphasizes that not
all students have to decide
immediately what they want
to do for the rest of their
lives, but rather should ‘‘think
in terms of what they want to

try.”

Anyone who is interested in
trying any of these programs
or would like to know more
about other ways he can turn
his ideas into experiences
should contact Ken Wood or
Suzie Summers in the Office of
Experiential Programs and

Life/Work Planning in the

Union Basement.

According to the proposal
‘social campus-wide events

should be scheduled to provide

a balance of cultural, educa-

tional and social events.”

Campus-wide events were
defined as events; *'a) to which
all students are invited and a
substantial number are expec-
ted to attend and, b) which
require a significant portion of
time.”

These events, the proposal

stated, ‘will generally be sche-
duled on Friday and Saturday

nights.

According to Dean of Stu-
dents and chairman of the
CCRL, will H. Terry, the
proposal, if approved by the
will “‘serve as a
guideline for scheduling.”’

president,

He went on to add that the
proposal is merely the written
form of an already understood
policy.

are looking for name recogni-
toin and alumni support. In
the ’60’s virtually all publicity
talked about the phenomenon
of a small college with high
academic standards playing
big-time basketball. That can-
not be denied.’’

Spencer indicated his op-
position to subsidizing other
college sports. He gave three

reasons.

“First [ think it is the kind
of thing there is no stopping.
This is what. happened with
football. We did not start out
with 52 grants, just a few.”’

“Second, I do not think it is
a necessary expenditure. We
would not get enough for our
money.”’

“And finally I am afraid the
students without scholarships
would be pushed to the bot-
tom.’’

currently underway, Dittman
said that the project is pro-
gressing “very promisingly."’

“That's a unique strong
point we have here,” pro-
claimed Dittman. ‘There is
not a penny of debt."’

“In the first fifteen months
(beginning July '76) more that
$4.5 million has been given or
committed,’’ he added.

Concerning funds to reno-
vate Martin Science Building,
Dittman confirmed that he is
“hoping for some gon. ai@Wws™
in the very near future.”
