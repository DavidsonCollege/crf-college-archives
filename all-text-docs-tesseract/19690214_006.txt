Social Activism

By BILL LINEAWEAVER
Asst. Managing Editor

Leon Howell, a Martin lec-
turer. spoke Wednesday night
in the Morrison Room on the
general necessity of social
activism and responsivness
in American society.

Howell. a 1957 graduate of
Davidsén, addressed an au-
dience of about 50 people. a
large part of whom were fac-
ulty members. Having served
in several international or-
ganizations, he has had con-
tact with students in many
parts of the world. He is
presently an associate editor
of “Christianity and Crisis”
magazine.

Talking about. Davidson.
Howell remarked that it is
“no worse than other South
ern schools Some of the best.

“One does have to work
harder here to really under-
stand what is going on in
critical areas." he added.
“For instance, I am appalled
at how little of the outside

“I think this experiment
will clarify debate on co-

life of the college,” Jewett
said. , ;
The visitation committee
has been broken down into

Murphy and Bliss are re-

ties. and Todd Hobbie heads
a group working on eating
and living arrangements.

Negro
Scholar
Unnamed

By JULE YOUNG
Statf Writer

The recipient of Davidson's
Negro Scholarship Fund is
still undetermined according
to former SGA president Joe
Murphy. Action will not be
taken on the award until later
this vear.

Murphy stated that ‘‘David-
son has had more Negro ap.
plicants this year than any
year before — I understand
that there are now 19 appli-
cations from black students."

Murphy said that the schol-
arship would probably be
given to one student for’ his
entire four years at David-
son.

In Murphy's words. “The
scholarship will probably be
used to replace the need for
the black student to accept
the college financial aid of-
fice’s usual $500 loan.”’

He nuted that the amount
raised in the fund drive was
not enough to completely un-
derwrite a black student's
expenses at Davidson. but
that one stumbling block to
the lower-income is the dif-
ficulty in repaying college-
incurred financial burdens, a
problem which would be les-
sened with the use of scholar-
ship money.

Murphy said he hoped that
the fact that students raised
the money -for the scholar-
ship would demonstrate that
students at Davidson went
sincerely beyond tokenism in
their interest toward blacks.

a member of the panel, said
that the only real difference
he found between the U.N.C.

In discussing what makes

out that he thought the best

city for hard work and of

In response to a question
concerning specialization in
