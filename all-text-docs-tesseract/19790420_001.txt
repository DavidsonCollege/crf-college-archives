Media Board sets
editorial election

By JIM GARRETT
News Editor

A new editor for The David- ~

sonian will be chosen in a
campus election on May 8,
according to Media Board Di-
rector Harry Greyard.

The date, determined by the
Media Board on Monday, is
subject to SGA approval.

Media Board members opted
for May 8 to enable the new
editor to organize a staff and to
recruit new writers well in
advance of publication next fall,
said Greyard.

The new editor will serve only
from September to December.
A regular election will be held in
December according to normal
sequence.

In the meeting Monday, the
Media Board also outlined a
proposal designed to help can-
didates for the editorship grasp
“the awesome responsibilities of
media,’’ according to Greyard.

The proposal, subject to
Trustee approval, requires can-
didates for the editorship to
sign a ‘‘statement of intent”

Leceunee leaves in protest

Canon Burgess Carr balks at
apparent slight to African student

By RICK JENKINS
News Editor

Reynolds Lecturer Canon
Burgess Carr refused to’ speak
Wednesday night at his sche-
duled 8 p.m. lecture and ended
prematurely his stay at David-
son by leaving early Thursday
morning.

According to College Union

Director Shaw Smith, Carr was ~

offended when Davidson’s only
African student, Janette Okom-
ba, was not included in the
preparation and welcoming ac-
tivities planned for his visit.

At the official greeting dinner
for Carr Wednesday night, O-
komba, as a regular ARA Slater
employee; was serving the meal
rather than attending it. as a
guest, Smith said.

Carr, according to Thurs-
day’s Charlotte Observer, said
“My position is that as the only
African student here she should
have been invited to sit down
with us... She should not have
been serving.”

Speakers Committee Chair-

PCC proposal designed to promote financial stability of eating houses

By EMMA CRICHTON
MILLER
Staff Writer

If the Patterson Court Coun-
cil’s proposals are passed next
Wednesday, choosing an eating
house could become a year-long
commitment.

According to PCC Chairman
Jeff Harris, the new proposals
stipulate those leaving one eat-
ing house or fraternity to join
another and those terminating
membership at an eating house
would have to pay a $40 penalty
to that house.

There will, of course, be
exemptions, Harris said. Those
going abroad, or involved in
other Davidson programs which
make staying at an eating house
impractical will be invited to
put their case before the coun-
cil,

The complicated issue of who
exactly should be exempt from

.the penalty’ has not yet been
fully discussed, and will be
decided next Wednesday, he
said.

Harris explained that propo-
sals are designed to cope with
the problem of people joining an
eating house enthusiastically in
the fall, and then changing, or
simply dropping out.

Were their money spent sole-
ly on the food, they ate, this
would not matter, but eating
houses have to pay overheads
and wages before they begin to
buy food-or provide for a social
program, he said.

The problem becomes par-

ticularly acute in the spring

te Woy tae ee

term. Harris pointed out, “In
the spring people want more
flexibility, to spend days at the
lake campus, or weekends away

from Davidson, and so more™

tend to drop out.”

Even a small drop-out per-
centage can radically affect the
economics of a house, he said.

Members of the administra-
tion, including Dean Terry,
believe the houses will not last
more than twenty years — that

small group feeding simply is
not economically viable. The
new Commons is being designed
to handle up to 1600 people —
perhaps with the thought that
they may have to provide for
eating house members in’ the
future.

The Patterson Court Council
feels the eating house is too
valuable a social institution to
be lost. It allows groups of
friends who may not share

.courses to meet at regular times
each day, Harris said.

Harris emphasized that, ‘“‘the
new proposals are intended to
benefit the majority who do
remain at their eating house,
by ensuring an adequate bud-
get, and are not designed
merely to penalize those who
leave.”

‘‘They are essential to the
economic survival of Patterson
Court,” he added.

Patterson to leave Davidson for administrative post

By ANN GARNER
Co-Editor

History professor Brown Pat-
terson is leaving Davidson to
become the Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences at the
University of the South, Se-
wanee, Tennessee. He will as-
sume the position in Fall, 1980.
Until then, he will be complet-
ing research on James I and the
early 17th century, as a New-
berry Library fellow in Chicago.

“The position is equivalent to

_the Dean of Faculty here,”’

Patterson explained. ‘‘I will be
primarily involved in two areas:
faculty development and cur-
riculum.”

Having taught at Davidson
for 16 years, Patterson com-
mented ‘‘I've been here long
enough to have served on
almost every committee of ma-
jor importance except the ad-
missions committee.”

“I wasn’t at all SNAP DY .
Davidson.”” He continued,

and scholarship here. Yet I’ve
been given a chance to help
direct and strengthen the whole
academic program at Sewanee.”

Patterson, a 1952 Sewanee

graduate, is also attracted by :

Sewanee’s affiliation, he said.
An ordained Episcopal priest,
Patterson served as the official
vicar of St. Alban’s in Davidson
from 1969-1978. He thinks this
experience ‘‘might be quite
appropriate in some ways.”

As Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences, Patterson
said he plans to encourage the
faculty to pursue scholarship in
their own particular fields as

well as to attract the best.

possible faculty members to
““Sewanee is very fortunate to
have received a grant from the
Mellon Foundation for faculty
development.”’ (The Mellon
Foundation gave Davidson a
similar grant two years ago.)
He added that in the area
of curriculum Sewanee needs

“to strengthen the Humanities

program with inter-disciplinary
courses and to redefine the
nature of Liberal Arts at Se-
wanee.”

As of now, the History
department has made no moves
to replace him. According to
Patterson, the department has
already decided not to replace
him while on leave for the 1979-
80 school year. Patterson es-
timates the department will

begin recruiting a new professor

‘to fill: his vacated position

sornetime next year.

man Ann Tutwiler said she
invited Okomba to the dinner
last week when she was issuing
invitations, but Okomba had
already committed herself to
working for ARA at the dinner
that night.

Okomba, however, said “‘she
(Tutwiler) had mentioned it (the
dinner) to me about a week ago,
but she had not issued an
invitation for any particular
day.”’

Tutwiler explained the con-
fusion over invitations may
have resulted from the fact that
formal, written invitations are
never issued for guest dinners.
Tutwiler said invitations are |
issued on an informa! basis, ;
usually over the phone-or in
passing.

Carr was scheduled to lecture
at Davidson Wednesday and
Thursday, after speaking at the
United Nations Tuesday after-
noon. After the formal welcom-
ing dinner held for-him Wed-
nesday in the Union’s Wilson
Room, he was to have presented
a talk in the 900 Room entitled
‘‘Christianity and Politics in
Africa.”” He had spoken earlier
in the day in the Gallery and

- had attended.an open luncheon.

“‘He was not at all belli-
gerent,’’ Smith said. He politely
refused to present his talk
according to Smith.

Smith subsequently made the
announcement to the approxi-
mately 100 guests who were
waiting to hear him.

“I’m sad about it because I
could have prevented it,”” Smith
said.

According to the Charlotte
Observer, Carr did not think
Davidson officials ‘‘were at-

tempting in any way to be

malicious. It was‘just the type
of insensitivity that gives you a

African leader. I did not want to
