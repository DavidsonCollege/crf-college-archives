WEEKLY MEETINGS.

The subpect for Saturday aight, Oc-'
tober 14th, “Resolved that the judges of
the Supreme Court should be elected by
popular vote,” was upheld on the. afirm-
ative by C. B. Robson, Cousar, Bellin-
grath and Bachman, who contended that

the present system of appointment of'

Supreme .Court judges is inconsistent
with democracy and leads towards mon-
archy; that it has been a failure in the
past. and there would be too much pow-
er placed into the hands of a few. The
eegative, defended by Bennett, Fraser,
Price and Matthews, argued that the
electorate was incompetent of judging
the ability of lawyers from the judicial
standpoint: that popular election tends
te lower the standard of the judiciary;
that it hampers the independence in case
decisions, and that past history upholds
the svstem of appointment. The decis-
ion of both the house and judges was in
favor of the negative. Under the head
of initiation of new members, J. S$. Bach-
man and G. M. King were received
into the society.

After the usual opening exercises in
the Phi Society on Saturday night, a
rather one-sided debate, from the view-
point of merit, was held. Those uv-
holding the affirmative were: R. W.
Robinson, R. L. Murrav, ‘T. N. Mor-
ton, B. H. Leyburn and D. C. Stagner.
Those on the negative were: R. H.
Stone, J. A. Thames, W. C. Neel, and
G. D. Sample. The negative won out
by unanimous decision of the judges.
and the house also decided in their
‘favor.

gram was rendered Monday morning:
C. G. Brown gave a declamation en-
titled “Christopher Columbus; L. L.
