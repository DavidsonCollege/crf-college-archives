The Ravidsaniat

Fuzzballers Bounce Back To 15-4

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

With only one more week
of regular season play re-
maining, Davidson's netters
_are, according to Coach Har-
ry Fogieman, “playing real
good tennis.”’

The squad now has a 154
overall record, Early in
April, the ‘Cats. were crip-
pled by the loss of Hy Lan-
kenau and captain Jeff Chet-
“wood due to torn ligaments.
The result was three straight
losses to Harvard, Virginia,
and Navy.

But when those two. re-
turned, the Wildcats began
what has stretched now to a
five match win_ streak.
V.M.I. and Richmond fell by
9-0 scores. Davidson then
beat The Citadel 8-1, George
Washington 7-2, and most re-
cently William and Mary 90.

Fogleman seemed pleased
“with his team's progress
throughout this season.

“We had that first part of
the season when we were suf-
fering from a lack of prac-
«tiee,”’ he said, ‘but we have
overcome that. We definite-
ly should be the fa@prite in
the conference tournament,
if we can keep from getting
overconfident.”

That Southern Conference
Tourney will be played next
Thursday, Friday, and Sat-
urday here.

David ‘Weaver, who plays
in the number two spot for
the Wildcats, echoed Fogle-
man’s optimism concerning
the team’s chances. He term-
ed Davidson's chances as
“excellent."’ He continued,

The Davidson sailing team
completed its final warm-up
for the South Atlantic Inter-
scholastic Sailing Association
finals by finishing second in
a regatta at the University
of Tennessee last Saturday.

Davidson finished behind
Clemson and® ahead of Ten-
nessee, Duke, and South Car-
olina,

Skippered by Al Lundy in
the A _ division and Jim
Hunter in the B_ division,
the Wildcats were only three
points off the pace set by
the winning Clemson team.

The Tennessee regatta was
the ‘Cats last event before to-
morrow’s ;Association cham-
pionship regatta at Hartwell
Lake in Clemson, S. C.

“Davidson is, along with
The Citadel and Clemson,
one of the top three teams
to watch for in the cham-
pionships,"’ said Hunter, the
team's senjor skipper.

‘We've improved a_ heck
of a lot this year. We should
definitely be in contention.”

In tomorrow's competition
the A_ races will be sailed
in ‘'420’s’’ while the .B
events will use “Penguins.”

Davidson’s skippers will be
either ~Lundy or. Bob Hag-
gard in the ‘A division and
Hunter in the B section.

“I have no doubt that we
will win.”’ f
‘Weaver was also optimistic
about his chances. “‘I have
not been too sharp all year,
but my game has picked up
in the last couple of weeks.
The whole thing may be psy-
chological and if it is, I hope
my game comes around by
tournament time.” —
Weaver was happy with
the progress of his freshman
doubles partner Bill Allen.
“Bill has been playing well
recently,”’ he stated, ‘‘but
perhaps not completely up
io his potential. But he has

greatly improved as the sea-
son has progressed.”

The number one player for
Davidson, Bob Koury, was
also pleased with his game.
‘In the last couple of match-
es,”’ he said, ‘‘my game has
been the best it has been all
year. I am especially happy
with the way my volleys are
coming around.”

Fogleman said that his
players would pass up any
opportunities to go to the
N.C.A.A. tennis champion-
ships in order to help him
teach his annual summer ten-
nis clinic.

Six of the Davidson net
ters will join their coach in
the instruction camp.

Davidson's last week of
matches before the tourna
ment is going to be far from
an easy set of Warm-ups.

The coming week's sched
ule includes some of the
toughest opponents for the
year for the Wildcats.

Today the Wildcats enter
tain. Presbyterian,

Fogleman called the Blue
Hose ‘‘the best tennis’ team
we will face this year.”

Fogleman added that Pres
byterian is favored to cap-

ture the N.C.A.A. small col-
lege championship.
Tomorrow the ’Cats travel
to Durham to face Duke.
They have matches sched-
uled for each of the two days
immediately prior to the
tournament, . going on the

lachian, and returning, home
