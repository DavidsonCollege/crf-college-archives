The International Relations Club
Sponsors Lecture

“The Current International Situa-
tion,” a topic of universal discussion,
was the subject of a talk given Friday
evening, November 24, by one of the
most notable speakers Davidson stu-
dents have had an opportunity to listen
to, Dr. Arnold J. Toynbee, director of
studies in the Royal Institute of Inter-
national Affairs, and research profes-
sor of international history on the Sir
Daniel Stevenson Foundation at the
University of London. Dr. Toynbee
came to Davidson under the sponsor-
ship of the International Relations
Club on the local campus.

The distinguished speaker, after be-
ing introduceddby Dr. T. W. Lingle,
discussed the social and political rela-
tions which prevail between Germany,
Russia, Austria, and Japan. “There
are two danger points in the world
today,” he began, “Germany and
Japan are both in the state of revolu-
tion. These two countries are alike
in the respect that only 20 per cent of
their university graduates are able to
find positions. The graduates have to
wait until five or ten years later before
they are able to go to work.”

“Germany ,has practically wiped out
the Communist party,” he continued.
“The situation in Germany today is
terrible, and the Germans have suffered
an economic crisis since the war.”

Dr. Toynbee was struck with the
helplessness of opposition to the Hit-
lerite government in Germany. The
mail, radio, press, telegraph, | public
gatherings, etc., are in the hands of the
government and are therefore closed
to opposition. All opposition is iso-
lated and paralyzed.

“There is an ill-feeling between the
old and young in Germany,” the speak-
er continued, “The young think that
they are privileged to push the old
out of their position, and the old are
resentful of this.

“What are the present and future
effects of Germany's ‘National Social-
ist’ revolution upon the rest of Europe?
War is more likely since youth is be-
ginning to believe that war is the only

Relic of Ney Is
Now On Exhibit

Testament of Mysterious Figure
Is Placed in Library

The internationally enigmatic figure
of Paul Stuart Ney, designer of the
Davidson College Seal and reputed
Marechal of France, broods over the
exhibition case of the library this
week. A French New Testament,
which belonged to him and contains
his handwriting, has been in the Lingle
family for nearly a century; Moses
Lingle, a graduate of Davidson and
uncle of President Lingle, the present
owner of the volume, received the
New Testament from Ney about 1840.

This book, now on exhibit in the li-
brary, is open to Ney’s autograph and
a page of French script (largely a
paraphrase of selections from the Ser-
mon on the Mount).

Paul Stuart Ney, whose profession
was that of teacher, prepared Moses
Lingle for entrance to Davidson. The
problem of P. S. Ney’s true identity
is, next to that of the Mecklenburg
Declaration of Independence, the pet
hobby of local antiquarians.

Professor T. W. Lingle has also pre-
sented for loan exhibit three old books
which have been in the family for
generations. These include a book of
devotional and liturgical literature,
printed in Weimar, Germany, in 1744,
a copy of the Heidelburg Catechism,
printed in Halle, 1795, and a German
Bible, with illuminated title page and
with the original wooden, leather-cov-
ered boards, printed in 1770.

Christmas Gift Fund

“The first duty of Davidson
College and community during
lean years is to relieve need and
suffering at home.” This feeling
led the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet to
decide that the Christmas Gift
Fund shall be given this year to
the Davidson Unity Church.
Each year the “Y” conducts a
campaign throughout the student
body to raise a sum of money
which is given to some worthy
cause. Through the channel of
Unity Church, formerly called
the “Mill Chapel,” the amount
raised this year will be adminis-
tered to alleviate cases of desti-
tution arising from long-contin-
ued economic stress. Food, cloth-
ing, and medical attention will be
provided where needed. The
campaign will be held December
11, 12, 13. The objective will be
$1,000.

Dramatists Plan First
Performance of Year

The first performance to be given
by the Red and Black Masquers this
year will be “The Second Shepherds

a conception of the birth of Christ.
It will be presented during the Christ-
mas services.

The time for the tryouts for “The
Second Shepherds Play,” which is un-
der the direction of Professor Erwin,
will be announced later.

As yet no definite program has been
made for the remainder of the year,

Among these is the presentation of the
plays, “Children of the Moon,” by
Martin Flavin, and “Candida,” by
George Bernard Shaw.
