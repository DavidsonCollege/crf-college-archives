John Theis Is Disgusted
With Outlook Of The

Taxi Business

By Bob Preyor
John Theis has been driving a taxi
for twenty years—and is disgusted
ed about the whole affair. Of course

there were interesting moments.
For instance, in 1933 two bandits
commandeered John’s brand new

taxi and after a fruitless chase by
the escaped—leaving
bullet holes engraved in the rear of
his car. “I made the pay
for it,. the bums” remarked Mr.
Theis in his usual caustic fashion,

Tonight

By A. Freshmen

Lo, the poor freshman! all
the persecuted humans this
topsy-screwy globe today, none is
more persecuted than a lowly first-

more on this side of the fence than
a member of Davidson’s humble
Class of '44. And, so I say, Behold,
the poor freshman!

Consider his case! He arises (in
the particular case I have in mind)
