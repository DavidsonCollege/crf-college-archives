Fagg Enthusiastic, |

Smith Cites Strain

By DON PARMAN
.. Sports Editor

As the old regime ends on
a-note of discouragement,
the new regime. enters. with
enthusiasm. ©

Newly appointed head
football coach Dave Fagg
was very optimistic and en-
thusiastic over the chances
for the fall edition of the
Wildcat squad. “I'm very
excited over the potential of
the boys we have coming
back and .I’m really look-
ing forward to next fall.’

“I don’t plan any changes
in. the offense. I'm just
awful happy with the way
the offense moved the ball
last year and I hope we can
continue to move it that
well. Our running game was
better than people
realized last year, The run-
ning was underrated and un-
derpublicized

most

because we
had some boys who earned
national recognition in’ pass-
ing.

“Right now I’m not sure

how we'll line up defensive-,

ly: My experience’ is with
an even line but we might
work with an odd line, what-
ever is more effective. One
thing | know is that our de-

fensive attitude will not
change. It has been buiid-
ing since 1965 and they

really have a fine attitude.”

Davidson is expected to
name a new defensive back-
field coach within a few
days. Offensive line coach
Turnley Todd has agreed to
remain on in his position.
Fagg said, ‘We couldn't be
more fortunate in having a
coach like Turnley Todd on
the staff. It thrilled me
when ‘he said he'd. stay.”

Fagg admitted that the
recruiting has been ‘‘slug-
gish,”’ but indicated that
Davidson still has a chance
at several outstanding ath-
letes who have applied here.

“The uncertainty of - the
position of the football pro-
gram hurt us in our recruit-
ing and so has the uncer-
tainty in the coaching situa-
tion, Before Coach Smith re-
signed Jimmy Jordan” had
already resigned to return
to graduate school and his
replacement hadn't been
chosen.”’

Departing head coach
Homer Smith indicated that

he considered one of the +} football

?

“disadvantages that Dave
Fagg has to work under, he
can’t have Dave Fagg as an
assistant.’

Smith's decision to resign
was the result of discourage-
ment he felt with the Da-
vidson football program and
his relations with it

“Why did I resign? I was
discouraged. Internally I
wasn't functioning very well.
There was a lot of strain,
and I felt it through 365
days. It. was almost ex
actly 365 from the day I
realized. that there was
serious consideration of do-
ing away with. ° subsidized
-football to the day I resign-
ed.’

Smith
he was
with the decision
after analyzing it closely. “i

of the football team be made

“| didn’t sense the har-
mony that I’d hoped the de-
cision would provide. From
the people who had advocat-
ed a deemphasized program,
| sensed a _ prophecy of
doom. They saw Davidson
football dying because of the
difficulty in raising the
money.

SMITH

. . . discouragement

“In looking back I see
that I had no other choice.”
Smith also indicted that
the change in admissions
policy made last spring by
the admissions committee of
the faculty did affect him
in his role as coach. ‘‘The
changes made did distress
me. I wanted to see what
\ could ‘be done to maximize
recruiting results.

I wanted to be part of the
decision making and I
wasn't.” )

Smith looked back over,
his tenure with pleasure. “I
don’t think any Davidson
person could have loved the
school more than I did,

“There really wasnt any
single. high point for me. It
would be easy to call last
season a high point but for
me it wasn’t any more so
than 1965 or 1966. | don’t
think that I'll remember the
years by wins and losses.”

“Davidson football has im-
proved steadily over the last
five seasons. We have never

velopment. The offense we
created was designed to fit

way that we could hate won

The Davidson swimmers

to Coach Tom Stevens, any
finish higher than that is
practically impossible,

“East Carolina should win

Mary has their best team
in years but they just don't
have the depth to win the

overall we don't have a
chance of beating VMI."

Stevens sees the be'st
chance for Davidson win-
ners in the freestyle sprints
where the Wildcats will fea-
ture Jim Newton and Mace
Davis. Newton has looked
particularly impressive in
recent meets, setting
school records in the 50 and
100 yard freestyle events in
the final meet of the season

“I have to pick the seed-

“and that will mean an East

Fall To Duke In Finale

By RICK BUSH
Sports Writer

When was the last time
Davidson beat UNC?

It was only last Saturday
as the wrestlers of Coach
Charlie Parker handed the
Tarheels a 20-14 loss at
Chapel Hill.

“We went after them and
stayed on top,”’ said Parker.
‘It is unusual for a team
so young to be so aggres-
sive.”"

Heavyweight Sean McCor-
mic sealed the _ victory
against UNC with a decision
in the final match of the
day. The tight contest was
not .decided until “McCor-
mick’s 6-3 win.

Also taking decisions for
Davidson were Ronnie Wil
fiams, Jack—--Jacobs,—-Rob
Benton and Jeff Dumansky.
Williams won by an im-
pressive 18-8 margin.

The regular season finale
in Johnston Gym Tuesday
night was a different story
for the. ‘Cats. The Duke Blue
strong contenders
for the ACC championship,
stopped the Wildcats by a
26-9 margin. ,

Davidson proved to be
weak in foo many import-
ant spots to upset Duke al-
though three grapplers did
win decisive victories.

At 126 Benton upped his
record to 7-1 with a 6-0 deci
sion over Irv Walker. Du-

‘ mansky picked up his fourth

win against three losses
with an. 8-0 decision in. the
134. pound class. ‘Several
times Dumansky was close
to a pin but lost his advant-
age and had to start over.

Davidson's third win’ was
a big one as Jacobs explod-
ed for a lopsided 17-1 vic-
tory in the 158 pound class.

cord to 6-2.

The Wildcats now begin

preparations for the Seuth-
ern Conference tournament

Despite ‘the team’s 35
final record, Parker points
to Dumansky, Benton and
Jacobs as contenders for in

dividual honors. “‘We won't
be first, but we won't be
