“Did you get thru all right?”

“Yea, boy.”

Such expresses the outcome of Senior
Speaking. Many a glad heart there is
among the Seniors and many the bur-
dens that are lifted and many the cares
that have melted away. “The last speech
is finished, and the last fair visitor has
flown. Senior Speaking, on the whole,
was an enjoyable occasion, and this is
said even after the experience of hearing
over two-thirds the orations. Many
facts that we had not heard before and
many ideas of which we had_ before
had no clear conception were brought

to our notice in an interesting manner,

and we acquired a good deal of infor-
mation about varied topics.

The war certainly proved highly bence-
ficial to many of the speakers, for we
were treated with a deluge of patriotism,
and “making the world safe for Democ-
racy” was sounded with aggravating
monotony.

There was once a cartoon of politi-
cians rushing to the graveyard, and
bringing forth all the great issues of the
past to bolster up their candidacy. This
cartoon showed them bringing out the
Declaration of Independence, the Dred
Scott Decision, and all such things as
that. It must be that there is some such
graveyard around here. Seniors hauled
out many of the great men of the past
time: Plato, Horace, Washington,
Patrick Henry, Emersan, Shakespeare,
all came in for a share of the glory.
Woodrow Wilson and Governor Bickett
also got honorable mention.

But for all that one cannot have else
than praise for cach and every Senior,
and congratulations on his speech.

ALL-STAR-JUNIOR GAME.

In a hard fought game of basketball
before a large crowd of visitors and stu-
dents a picked team defeated the class
champions by the score of 58 to 45. It
was due to the excellent shooting of
Hengeveld and King that the All-Stars
were able to pile up such a large score:
The shooting of Hawkins for the Ju-
niors was also very good, while the
guarding of McAskill was the best seen
here this year. Line-up:

Sixth Successive Vietory Won
When Wildcats Defeat Tigers

Despite Many Disadvantages - Davidson Overcomes Clemson's Lead
and Vins by Score of 21 to 9.

Outweighed fully twenty pounds per
man, handicapped by a heavy, muddy

field and soggy ball which placed all the

advantage with her opponent’s straight

football, and outlucked at the very start
of the game, Davidson closed her 1917
football season in a great blaze of glory
when she gamely fought back the lost

ground and turned in a final score of

21 to 9 over Clemson, keeping her slate

free from defeat by the Tigers.
The game, which was one of the best

to witness and one of the hardest to

endure that Davidson has billed this
year, started off mighty inauspiciausly
for the Wildcats when Banks received
Grey's initial kick-off on his own 5-vard
line and slipped down the sideline for
a go-yard return. A_ touchdown was
barely averted on this run by the spee
work of “Wooly” Grey, who ran Banks
down and stopped him on Davidson's
6-yard line. On the next play, David-
son was penalized 5 yards for offside.
and Clemson easily made the 1 yard
necessary for a touchdown. The Tigers
were out for blood, and their whole
season had been worked up gradually to
the express end of defeating Davidson
and avenging the 33-0 slaughter of last
fall. This first touchdown gave them
plenty of “pep,” and they tore into Da-
vidson’s million dollar line with great
vim, but. their steam soon subsided when
they failed to gain consistently, and the
remainder of the first half resolved itself
into a see-saw affair, with punting and

fumbles playing the main roles. David
son came back in the second quarter with
a touchdown on as pretty a forward pass
as Henry Spann and George King, those
peerless exponents of the Zeppelin va.
riety of football, have engineered this
season. Spann, despite the slippery con-
dition of the heavy ball, hurled the oval
25 yards to King, who ran thru the
Clemson backfield for a touchdown.
Grey kicked goal, and the score was
tied, Davidson, 7; Clemson, 7.

Clemson scored two more points near
the close of this quarter when Davidson
was forced to punt from behind her goal
line on acount of penalties and a costly
fumble, and Grey let the ball elude him,
‘Thackston tackling him 1 yard behind
the line for a safety. Wooly * barely
missed getting the ball into the field, his
last step taking him out of hounds -in-
stead of into the field, or the two points
would have been saved. The first half
thus ended with the score: Clemson, 9;
Davidson, 7.

Clemson entered the second half full
of hope, but they left it with her chances
blasted. Davidson opened up forward
passes of all varieties, and soon after the
beginning of the third quarter had the
ball in striking distance of the Tiger
goal. Armstrong here intercepted a Da-
vidson pass, but on attempting to return
the ball, fumbled, and Wooly Grey
scooped the ball up and galloped 15
yards for a touchdown, kicking goal a

Review of Davidson
Football Season

Coach Fetzer Makes Wonderful
Showing With Team.

With the game Thursday, Davidson
wound up her ‘1917 football season.

From many points of view this has been
her most successful one. With compara-
tively little material from which to pick,
Coach Fetzer has turned out a team of
which we should be—and certainly are
—proud. Messrs. Fetzer and Klutz took
four Varsity men, half a dozen “D.C.”
men with a few more from class football
and the Freshinan class and) moulded
them into a fighting machine worthy of
the Red and Black reputation.

For the first game of the season the
Fetzerites journeyed up in: Maryland to
play Navy. According to the Washing-
ton Star! “Both teams showed that vaca-
tion is just over. Coach Dobie’s big,
powerful linemen and fast, aggressive
backs failed to measure up to our expec-
tations when they hit up against. that
scrappy bunch from) North Carolina.”
Navy's weight told in the end and Da-

COACH FETZER.

vidson lost 6-27; but Navy’s season start
was spoiled—her goal line was crossed.

On the next Saturday, Davidson lost
to N.C. A. &-E., in Raleigh, 3-7. The
weather was too warm for much “pep.”
Burns and Flowers plowed up A. & F.'s
line almost at will, but the whistle for
the half caught them lacking one yard
for a touchdown.

In the Georgia Tech game Davidson
really struck her stride. Against Coach
Heisman’s ‘Golden Tornado” David-
son matched her best. When the final
whistle blew, Davidson had recorded a
touchdown and a field goal—the largest
