lodge a berth for th’s year’s tournament, -On parade will be
some of the greatest basketball players in-the entire South.
Glamack of Carolina, McFadyen of Clemson; Price of Duke,
and DeWitt of Maryland will be a few of the many stars parti-
cipating-in-thts year’s tournament. But don’t sell those ever
dangerous Generals of Washington and Lee short. They look
mighty from this column. It seems only a short time

Basketball Season Comes To Close

Coach Shgpard’s basketball club hit their—full_ stride —last
Monday’ night as they swept through the Purple Hurricane
of Furman. Too bad that they couldn't have been that hot all
season. Davidson will miss many of those boys next year.
Gone will be Footsie Cowan, a mainstay of the team for the
past three years. Benny and Hayseed will surely be missed
for their all round play has added much to the teams success.
Apie Means, playing jis first year of varsity ball, turned in
creditable performances the entire season. After last
Monday's game, Réferee Blume said that the Wildcats played
the cleanest game that he had called all season, A truly great
compliment. Also—his first all-state basketball team would
follows—Glamack at center, Cowan and Price at for-
wards and Cline and Hogg at guards. For a man who sees
them all play, that should be a fairly accurate team, By
scoring eighteen points against Furman, Cowan grabbed seéc-
ond place among the conference seoring leaders for this year,
Hogg came in at sixth place. Next year’s basketball team
should prove to be better than this year’s club. With the re-
turning of Hogg, Simonds, Yarborough, and McLeod, and the
rising of several promising freshmen, Coach Shepard should
be able to mould a formidable quintet for next year. Hats_off
to the student body, who backed the team 100 per cent this
year.

Spring Athletics Begin

Spring athletics will soon be under way. Already base-
ball pitchers.and catchers have bégun to work out and the
entire team gets down to practice next week. Thomas, Mc-
Lean, Lucas and Ficklen will take care of the mound duties.
Hunter, Fitzgerald and Carter should add to the batting aver-
age of this year’s team. ; ;

This year’s tennis team should again be good, with the
returning of Tenney, Turner and Hunter. Already a long
trip has been planned and the team,-under the direction of
Coach Johnson, looks forward to a successful year.

Due to heavy rains-the-first two
days, and any players—out. with
injuries, spring praetice ray rather

slow last week, with the coaches
resorting mostly to light scrim-
mages—and..pass.defense..and_ of-
fense.

Coach McEver spent most of his

time last week working on new
pass plays and pass defense set-
ups. The backs also spent much
timeworking oh play-timing and

Spencer, Sharpe, and Fredericks

worked-on--quick-kicks, while the
ends were coached in pass receiv-
ing by Coach Spearman.

Blocking Machine

Last week, Coach | Spearman
brought his now invention, a
hydraulic blocking machine which
registers the pressure of a block,
and also puts up a resistence-as of
a charging lineman. Coach Spear-
man has just completed this gadget
and has gotten a patent on it. The
linemen have spent, much of their
time working on this machine, in
an effort to improve their charge.

Many Injuries

Several of the boys out with in-
juries are Dick Arnold, Bob John-
son, Ed Hipp, Dave Maliney, Gran-
ny Sharpe, Bill Pharr, and Jay
Bolin. Fhey are, however, expected
to be back in uniform before long.
Several others of the early starters
have dropped off—some for scho-
lastic reasons and others for numer-
ous reasons. The squad now ‘$tands
at about 40 members.

Practice last week was topped off
with a game scrimmage on Satur-
day, in which the two teams bat-
tled about terms. Both
showed well developed offense
but weakness on defense. Attempts
will be made to eradicate these
weaknesSes in the practice sessions
that will continue till the holidays.
