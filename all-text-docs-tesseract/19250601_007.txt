THE DAVIDSONIAN, JUNE 1, 1925

Judge T. B. Fraser Passes

Away at Sumter Home

Graduated from Davidson in 1881—
Justice of South Carolina
Supreme Court

“The blue flag of South Carolina flies at
half mast atop the State house—token of
the state’s sorrow at the death at Sumter
yesterday morning of Thomas B. Fraser, as-
sociate justice of the Supreme Court of
South Carolina.”

So says the Columbia State in a lead ar-
ticle in its issue of Friday, May 22. The
account continues :

“Justice Fraser last week had sat with the
court for its regular May session, and Sat-
urday had left Columbia apparently in’ the
best of health and spirits. Yesterday morn-
ing came the word of his death.

“As a mark of respect to the dead, the
state flag was ordered lowered to half mast
as soon as the news reached Columbia. It
will be continued at half mast today.

“All offices of the state government will
be closed today as a mark of respect, and
practically every branch of the government
will be represented at the funeral.”

The news brings a touch of sadness to the
Davidsonians who knew and loved
this distinguished alumnus, of the class of
1881. Judge Fraser is vividly remembered
by many Davidson students for his masterfu!
address before the Y, M. C. A. last fall.

Thomas Boone Fraser, in addition to being
an eminent lawyer, of whom Davidson might
justly be proud, was’ a strong man of God.
At an early age, he united himself with the
Presbyterian Church, of which he has been

Concerning his character, the account. of
his death says the following: “The associ-
ate justice was a man whom everybody in
the community respected. Sumter was proud
of him, for he was a learned lawyer, a fear-
less and painstaking judge, -a good and pa-
triotic citizen, and a pious and sincere Chris-
tian gentleman of whom no one could ever
say one word of reproach.”

He was stricken with a heart attack about
midnight. At that time the family physician

Mrs. Fraser, formerly Miss Emma Ed-
munds, was away at the time of the heart
attack, attending to their daughter, Miss
Claudia Fraser, who was sick at Kannapolis,

N.C. The sympathy of all Davidson is ex-
tended to Mrs, Fraser and Miss Claudia
Fraser.

An editorial in the Cohunbia State pays
so fine a tribute to this eminent son of Da-
vidson that it is here quoted in full:

“Son and namesake of the editor and cir-
cuit judge, Thomas Boone Fraser, Mr. As-
sogiate Justice Fraser, whose death in
Sumter, South Carolina, laments today,
worthily wore through 65 years .an honored
name, and served well his Church and State.

“Lawyer 30 years at the Sumter bar, 11

years member of the lower House in the |

General Assembly, during five of which he
Was chairman of its judiciary committee, and
since 1912 a member of the supreme court,
Mr. Fraser throughout his career held and
practiced exalted ideals of public service, He
bore himself, as lawyer, legislator, and judge,
with simple dignity, with high-minded regard
for professional decorum, and with the most
delicately scrupulous care for interests com-
mitted into his hands. The fine tradition of
the South Carolina supreme court gains no
little by reason of his 13 years on its bench.

“Mr. Fraser in private life was a modest
Christian gentleman, faithful and diligent in
the work of his Church. Earnest Bible stu-
dent and teacher, (he powerfully influenced

for good the many young people who first |

and last held membership in his classes.

“South Carolina’s name and fame neve:
rested more secure than in the hands of T.
B. Fraser.”

We would suggest the following method of
grading for all professors: :

25 per cent for knowing the name of this
college. :

13 per cent for originality.

15 per cent for arriving on time.

10 per cent for staying the whole period.

10 per cent for knowing who wrote the
text-book,

23 per cent of the student doesn’t sleep
more than half the time.

2 per cent for knowledge of subject.

Five hundred are expected to be present at
the annual luncheon of the Alumni Associa-

boro, is the president of the association and
will preside at the luncheon. Mr, H. T.
Mills, ‘06, of Spartanburg, S. C., is the first
vice-president, and Mr. J. C. Harper, ‘15, of
Lenoir, is second vice-president. Prof. T. L.
Blythe, '07, of Davidson College, is the sec-

The Alumni Association has done much to
help in the improvements which have been
taking place during the past few years. The
president of the association, Mr. “Lump”
| Richardson, is the donor of the Richardson
| Athletic Field, a cut of which appears below.
This field includes two gridirons, a baseball
diamond and a quarter-mile cinder track. For
two years the athletic contests have been
played on this field, although the grass had
not come up well. Now, however, there is a
good stand of grass on the entire field, and
it is one of the best in the state.

The reunions of the various classes will
be held at this time, the class. of '24 ‘holding

its one-year reunion, the class of '20 its five-|

year reunion, and the classes before them
