ro

Union anticipates three turn- overs

By KIM KEPCHAR
Staff Writer

The elections for Union
executives are largely pre-de-
termined, with two of the
three positions running uncon-
tested. John Monroe and Da-
vid Barnard will vie for the
office of vice-president in
charge of the Social Council,
while Mary Jo Clark will step
into the position of Union
president and Amanda Hall
into the position of vice-presi-
dent of the Co-Curricular
Council.

David Barnard is running
for Social Council vice-presi-
dent stressing ‘‘how strong
the Union can be.”

As a member of the Senate
last year, he had a tendency to
concentrate on social improve-
ment, being active in the
organization of the campus
wide party in front of Belk last
year, the Top Hats and Cat
Tales talent show, and the
Sophomore Class De-orienta-
tion.

In office, Barnard would
like to work for a coordination

Some things he would like
to see are more Open Mike
programs, involving the use of
student talent, faculty and
student ‘‘Songs and Beer,”’
and events such as the marsh-
mallow roast held earlier this

Barnard
year.

Wanting to get students
involved in social events,
Monroe would like to see more
gatherings at the Lake Cam-
pus and better publicity for
other campus-wide events.

Monroe feels that he could
bring to the vice-presidency a
natural talent for communica-
ting and organizing. He is
mostly interested in alterna-
tives which encourage student
and community involvement.

Mary Jo Clark enters her
position with substantial ex-
perience. Founder and organi-
zer of the Union Short Courses
and Wednesday Open Lun-
cheon, she is presently chair-
man of the Union Minorities
Committee and ex-chairman of
the Poetry Committee.

As Union president she will
work with Union Director C.
Shaw and the administration
in coordinating Union Activi-
ties. She will channel the
energy of Social and Co-Curri-
cular Councils to ensure
smooth running, and as presi-
dent is charged with activities
not under either council’s jur-

isdiction.

Finally the president is re-
sponsible for policy-making
with respect to activities and
planning.

Clark wants to ‘“‘enhance the
Union’s function as Davidson

Monroe
College’s living room, rather
that Davidson’s study.”

To achieve this she will
strive for improved communi-
cations and planning with
Patterson Court and the SGA
and plans for the publication

of a Union newsletter.

Amanda Hall, as Co-Curri-
cular Council vice-president,
will coordinate programming |
of cultural events on campus:
those programs dealing with
such series as Open End,
Evenings With, Gallery ex-
hibits, speakers, and Fine
Films.

She will ‘‘serve as a com-
munication and information
source,’’ to advise these com-
mittees of various possibilities
for programs.

Having already served as
chairman of the Cultural E-
vents Committee, Hall comes
into the position with experi-
ence.

As. Council vice-president
she would like to see an
emphasis on American tradi-
tional events, such as pro-
grams that Davidson is al-
ready. sponsoring like Odetta
and Count Basie.

Media contestants aim for innovation

of Union and Patterson Court Wildcat Handbook

activities, feeling the students
suffer from a lack of such
coordination. He also feels
that spending could possibly
be more efficient.

One idea he would like to see
the Union investigate is of-

fering buses to events in.

Charlote: to Davidson basket-
ball games, concerts, and o-
ther social functions.

He feels costs could be cut
by using speakers and bands
who are already in the area for
other schools.

He would also like to see a
better utilization of the physi-
cal plant, including Richard-
son Plaza for large gatherings
and the 900 Room perfor-
mances.

John Monroe, if elected as
Social Council vice-president,
would like to get away from
what he jokingly refers to as
Davidson’s social norm of a
week of ‘‘books and (then)
getting blasted on weekends.”’

Having worked with the
Uncommitted Committee, he
would like to see more sponta-
neous and creative events on
campus.

There are three challengers
for the editorship of the Wild-
cat Handbook. Sophomores
Noelle McHugh and Anne
Woods are running for co-edi-
tor positions, as are Sopho-
mores Aida Doss and A.T.
Miller. Junior Beverly Bortell
is the third contender in the
election.

McHuch and Woods want
to continue to make theWild-
cat Handbook a useful tool
freshmen,

“As co-editors, we feel we
can achieve this goal, as we
would not be limiting the
handbook to one person’s cre-

.ativity. Having worked toget-

her before on self-initiated
projects, we have recognized
our cooperative potentials and
feel that we can make a
constructive contribution to
Davidson.”’

Doss and Miller feel that
their strong points are diversi-
ty and previous experience in

publications. They hope that
their varied interests and in-
volvements at Davidson will
give them lots of creative
drawing power.

The two:have no radical:
changes in mind for the Wild-
cat Hc--dbook, but they plan
to work on such things as a
more realistic and useful des-
cription of the Patterson Court
houses. They also want to
continue to have seperate
Handbooks for freshmen and
upperclassmen.

“Actually, anybody could

put a Handbook together, but -

we’re willing to take on the
responsibility to do it well,’’
said Miller.

Although running alone for
the position, Bortell states
that she expects to have at

least-a-small_staff_and will be
open to input from others. She
is currently planning on a
career in mass communica-
tions or public relations, which
accounts for her interest in the
position.

“I think it would be a real
challenge to make the Hand-

book attractive enough that
the freshmen will really want
to read it.”’

As a junior, Bortell consi-
ders her experience and know-

ledge of freshman needs and
her familiarity with people and
places in the area to be assets
worthy of consideration.

Quips and Cranks

Cline

Steve Cline ’79 and Lana
Sims '79 are running uncon-
tested for the Quips and
Cranks editorship. Cline and
Sims were surprised at the
“lack of interest in the year-
book as evidenced by the
factor that no one else is
running for the editor’s Pposi-
tion.”

However, the soon-to-be

Sims
co-editors are admittedly ‘‘ex- '
cited about the responsibility
and enthusiastic about the job
that lies ahead.”’

The duo hopes to blend their
ideas and previous publica-
tions experience with input
from the College community
and the yearbook staff in order
to produce a really creative
Quips and Cranks.
