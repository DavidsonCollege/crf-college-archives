Student Missionary Brings Christmas Message to Russia

By Bo Bartholomew

This past Christmas Break I
was fortunate to be invited to go to
the Soviet Republics in order to
take part in their first Christmas
holiday since 1918 and help share
the meaning of Christmas. This
year marks the first year in sev-
enty-five years that the people of
Russia have been allowed to cel-
ebrate Christmas publicly and le-
gally.

Many churches were driven
underground during the Commu-
nist reign and have been celebrat-
ing this special day in private. Now
all have freedom to celebrate
publically.

Inhonor of this special Christ-
mas in Russia, a group called To-
gether International made up of
American and Russian Christian
partners organized a contract with
the Soviet Government to erect a
60 foot tall Christmas tree in
Moscow’s Red Square. In the
middle of December the artificial
tree was delivered from California
and set up between the Kremlin
clock tower and the colorful St.
Basil’s Cathedral.

Ten Americans made up the
American half of Together Inter-
national: myself, my parents, my
sister Anne, and Ken Alexandrov
(a metro cop in Nashville), Rever-
end and Mrs. Watson of the First
Baptist Church of Miami, Mr. and
Mrs. Sprinkle (contributors from
Miami), and Deneen Alexandrov.
Deneen Alexandrov is a gospel
singer who has a Russian mother

“and a Ukrainian grandmother. She
leamed both languages growing
up and now has produced the first
gospel album in Russian with the
help of the Russian government.
Deneen organized and ran the trip
for all of us. Our Russian partners
were business men in Moscow and
leading officials of Dynamo, the
powerful soccer organization in
the Ukraine. With this group we
set out to Iet as many people as
possible know the reason for
Christmas.

We visited several orphanages
and homes for mentally retarded
children. I got to tell several chil-
dren about how Jesus died for them
and about His birthday. We gave
eachchilda Children’s Bible trans-

lated into Russian and a Barbi doll
or matchbox car. These children
had a few toys, but never any they
could keep and call their own.

At one home for mentally re-
tarded children, my sister and I did
a skit in which I acted like a plane
and a chicken. After the skit and a
prayer we helped the children look
through their new Bibles and play
with their new toys. As I was help-
ing one girl play with her Barbi
doll, a gameat which did not have
much experience, she started hug-
ging me and muttering something
in Russian. The joy in her smile
which I could definitely under-
stand made the whole trip worth
while.

At the end of the trip, one
orphanage gave a song and dance
show for us, and several little boys
ran up to see if I would dance with
them. I didn’t realize the impact
we had made on these children.
They had so little in their lives
compared to the worst orphanages
in America, and yet they were still
full of joy. Inrooms the size of one
of the history classrooms in Cham-
bers there would be twelve to fif-
teen little beds. It is hard to imag-
ine the life people live outside of
America because we are so well
off.

When we weren’t at an or-
phanage, we spent a lot of time on
Red Square around the Christmas
tree even though it was zero de-
grees Fahrenheit (not counting the
wind chill).

Rev. Watson brought around
“40,000 copics of a pamphlet my
mother and I had made which told
about the Christmas tree, Christ-
mas, and Jesus Christ. Walking
around the tree giving these pam-
phlets out, we were amazed to see
the delight on faces in the crowd
around the 60 ft tall Christmas tree.
In the United States this would
‘have been a simple pleasure. The
pieces of paper we handed out
would have ended up on the floor
before anyone would even care to
read them, but in Russia people
were curious and glad to receive
what we had to offer. As I was
handing out our tracts, one
babushka or Russian grandmother
gave me a big smile showing her
many gold-capped teeth and mo-

tioned for me to dance with her to
the music of the festival. It was sort
of a jig rather than a dance and I
think its main purpose was to keep
you warm. Several older ladies
were whirling around to the upbeat
Russian disco music,

On New Year’s Eve came the
big tree-lighting ceremony. Be-
cause there are two Christmas days

in Russia — one on December 25

for most of the Christian faiths and
then one on January 7 for the Rus-
sian Orthodox church which
chooses to use a different calendar
— the government chose to light
the tree on this neutral day be-
tween the holidays. On New Year’s
day the Yeltsin government puton
several entertainment shows about
Santa Clause and different musical
dances, The big guy with a beard in
a blue suit seemed to be Santa.
Besides the dancing grand-

mothers, the military guards pro- -

tecting the tree, and the freezing
weather, we saw some interesting
things around the tree. The first

was New Year’sEve onthe square.

About five minutes to midnight we
ran out to Red Square. An air of
excitement arose from the histori-
cal site and the enormous amounts
ofalcohol the Russians were drink-
ing. As the Kremlin Clock Tower
rang out its twelve gongs, fire-
works, champagne, and shouts
exploded from the crowd.

At one end of the square was
an array of red flags with the ham-
mer and sickle. The old Commu-
nists were having a demonstration
as Well as ‘trying’to keep Lenin’s
tomb safe. All of a sudden a large
crowd carrying the red, white, and
blue flags of the new Nationalists
party which supports Yeltsincame
running in. One nationalist was
wearing nothing but shorts and
downing vodka and it was at least
20-30 below. Our Russian hosts,
afraid a fight might break out, be-
gan ushering us away from the
action. As we left, the crowd was
gathering around the Christmas
Tree, although the tradition in the
past has been to spend New Year’s
Eve in front of Lenin’s tomb.
Deneen said, “I hope we are start-
ing a new tradition.”

The second major event was
the Start II treaty talks between

Stapleton Program Offers Service
Opportunities in Urban Charlotte

By Grey Timberlake

Thinking about plans for this
summer? The Stapleton/Davidson
Urban Service Internship provides
a great opportunity for four
Davidson students to spend ten
weeks of the summer doing Chris-
tian service in inner-city Charlotte.
Each intern would receive a $2500
stipend, supported by the Stapleton/
Davidson endowment. Housing is
provided by members of
Charlotte’s First Presbyterian
Church and Covenant Presbyte-
rian Church.

Last summer’s interns,
Kathleen Gordon, Erin McGee,
Rob Hughes, and Grey Timberlake
participated in a variety of service
work, all of which proved to be
challenging, rewarding,andsome-

times frustrating. Gordon served
as an intern at the Children’s Law
Center, an agency which provides
legal representation and advocacy
for children involved in the Juve-
nile Court System.

McGee worked with families
through the Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Housing Partnership,
an agency which seeks to provide
affordable and well-maintained
housing to low income families.
Hughes worked with children and
adolescents involved in family cri-
sis at the Relatives, a youth crisis

intervention center which seeks to’

provide comprehensive services to
young people ages 7 to 17 and their
families.

Timberlake served as a third
grade teacher for disadvantaged

children from one of Charlotte’s
low income housing projects at the
Seigle Avenue Presbyterian
Church Summer Christian Educa-
tion Program. Hughes and
Timberlake also served part-time
at Crisis Assistance Ministry in the
financial assistance program. In-
terns learned much about the Char-
lotte social service network, by
visiting many of Charlotte’s social
service agencies. Interns also en-
joyed getting involved in their host
churches. Committees from each
church provided friendship, sup-
port, and advice for the interns.

President Bush and President
Yeltsin on January 2, 1993. The
Christmas Tree is right at the en-
trance where Bush drove into the
Kremlin. Our tour of the Kremlin
wascanceled because of this meet-
ing. As Bush and Yeltsin were
talking in the Kremlin maybe they
looked out the window and real-
ized that the past decade has im-
proved Russian and American re-
lations more than could have been
dreamed - even to: the point of

having a Christmas Tree next to

Lenin’s tomb.

The second half of our trip
was in Kiev, Ukraine. The state of
affairs of this republic is just about
identical to all the others. Here we
toured and saw the sights. Deneen
Alexandrov is a celebrity here, so
we got first class treatment. One
adventure for us was going to a
Ukrainian Opera for the equiva-
lent of five cents and then having
eleven cokes and three pastries for
about sixty-five cents. This cul-
tural experience was one I would
never have missed.

The large central square in
Kieviscalled Independence Square
and even had its own Christmas
Tree. Across from this tree was a
place where one year ago Lenin’s
Statue stood. Now there is a stage
set up with a large picture of Mary
and Baby Jesusright where Lenin’s
statue had been. Our fifteen-year-
old interpreter told us, “Tonly hope
the people of Kiev will replace
Lenin with Jesus Christ in all ar-
eas.”

’ Mikhail, the interpreter, told

us he had arranged the schedule so
that Pastor Watson would be able
to speak at a new church he at-
tended. It was so new it did not
even have a name. That night in a
large classroom of an office build-
ing 200 people had gathered. There
was no heatand their hymnals were
hand-made copies. Soon there were
300 people packed in the room.
The Pastor asked me to open the
sermon with testimony and scrip-
ture. In five minutes I prepared my
small sermon which Mikhail trans-
lated. Speaking through an inter-
preter is notatall easy especially if
you try to keep your thoughts on
track. I toldof my experience with
Christ and how he helped me on
the football field. I am not sure if
they understood everything, but
they laughed either with me or at
me and several kids smiled. After
Pastor. Watson spoke, each child
from the age of four to fourteen
recited Christmas poems. It was an
amazing evening.

Moscow and Kiev are pov-
erty-stricken cities in foreign lands,
but I loved every minute of the
special magic of their people and
culture. Whether this trip was a
missions trip or a tourist vacation,
we will never forget the people and
the smiles of the children whose
lives we were able to touch. A lot
is needed over there from basic
necessities to a trustworthy reli-
gion. Their spirits are still up, how-
ever, and they definitely raised
mine.
