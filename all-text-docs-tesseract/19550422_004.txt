Edited by WATT McCAIN

“Those imbecilic yardbirds in
Belk’s basement have been a thorn
in my flesh for twelve months.
Sergeant Sketches, propaganda pic-
tures, bundles of trash for front
page release. The. PIO used to
send me twenty article a week; I'd
print nineteen and they’d fume
over the lack of publicity. Just
last week Hank's shot of federal
inspection sent the cadre into a
military dither. They claimed we
made their exhibition look like a
dog show or pet shop.

“My detest for ROTC began in
high school. Three years of play-
ing GI at McCallie was plenty for
me. I was in a state of flux then
and flexed the opposite way. At
least Joe MecCarthy’s on my side.”

Henry placed his ROTC pennant
on the carrel shelf and lowered his
chair from its editors’ tilt. “Then
McCutchen kept telling me how
to run the paper. How can a guy
be editor of the Davidsonien and
answer questions for everybody
every week when he doesn't know
the answers himself? I begged for
scoops but the staff could never
keep a secret ‘til Friday. And my
only attempt as a Washington cor-
respondent failed; my copy never
got back to Davidson.”

“The general appearance of the
paper did improve. don’t you
think? But there was Hiram Caton.
And Gilbert. Too many words for
the type of ‘content and too much
content for the words. Gragg never
argues; he just reveals. That pub-
lication was a real sweat. Felt like
I'd had a baby every Friday after-
noon.”

“My views were never too ac-
ceptable. I’m the only person in
school favoring compulsory Y
membership. And a paper I wrote
on fraternity social life that Dr.
Abernethy read in class almost
caused an open revolt. The SPEs
elected me rush chairman two
years because I was the least hope-
ful personality and would insure
maintainance of an _ exclusive
group.”

Back at his single room in Duke,
Brockmann pulled out a twisted
pipe and chewed on it carefully,
not letting it slip between his two
front teeth. On his chest of
drawers lay a chain with Phi Beta
Kappa and ODK keys. “T’ve been
doing honors work in English Con-
stitutional History. Did you know
T was the first person in Davidson
history to take an honors course
in summer school?”

On the closet door hung an eve-
ning dress. “My girl’s. Got my
wife picked out but she won't
marry me until she graduates. On
dance weekends ‘she used to stay
at the Mebane’s. 'd move there

Two Frafs and CC
Elect New Officers

Two social fraternities and the
Campus Club have announced the
results of thelr elections of of-
ficers for the 1055-56 term. As
yet the SAE’s are the only re-
maining fraternity to hold elec-
tions.

The Pi Kappa Phi Order has
chosen Carl Jackson president;
Phil Hicks, secreary; Bill Bard,
treasurer; Jack Williamson, IFC
representative.

The Sigma Chi group will have
Jeter Abernathy as president;
Charlie Robinson, vice-president;
Jim Kuist, recording secretary;
John Trotti, corresponding secre-
tary; Jimmy Kiser, treasurer; Ray
Harding, IFC representative.

too, to the room next door and
we'd talk. When 1 pinned her I
missed and pinned her waist.”
“My greatest thrill at Dayidson
has been waking every morning to
the golden sunshine and green
grass. ‘Good morning birds, good
morning trees, good morning sun.’
I got a charge out of pulling the
‘ultimate’ on Will Terry. We
answered about fifty magazine ads
in his name, and in one day he
received two dozen chicks, a
sample box of kleenex and a repre-
sentative from Cyclone fences.”
“Will and I used to double-date
together. You know I never did
appreciate those exhibitions at
Neisler’s cabin. I’ve got strange
views I guess. After my campaign
speech last spring Dr. Davidson
called me a rabble rouser. Will
named me ‘Little Caesar,’ because
of dictatorial ideas. But then Cae-

THE DAVIDSO

Is Interested And Varied)

By CARL COOPER

“Hello, My Coney Island

Baby . . .” On the evening of

September 12, 1954, the melodious words of this familiar song
rang out at the Queens College Freshman Dance in Charlotte.

The music was received enthusiastically by those present;
the arrangements of this and other songs on the program
were new and different; the four singers sang as though
they tremendously enjoyed singing together.

As they road back to Davidson
that night, the four singers
stopped singing long enough to
make some plans to sing together
in the future. At that moment The
Four Lamplighters, one of the
most colorful and versatile musical
groups Davidson has seen in re-
cent years, was born.

The new quartet, consisting of
Sandy -McGeachy, Leighton Mc-
Cutchen, Joe Garrison, and Bob
Martin, began to accept engage-
ments to sing at church suppers
and club meetings; Mr. Plott of
the music department, noticed
them and encouraged their ven-
ture.

At Homecoming the group sang
at various fraternity houses dur-
ing the dance intermissions and
sang at the Y party at Erwin
Lodge. Their first appearance in
chapel was greeted with the en-
thusiastic praise of the student
body.

Shortly before Christmas the
quartet, who insist on being called
the Four Lamplighters, lest they
be confused with a nationally-
known group called the Lampligh-
ters, began to receive many in-
vitations to sing, in fact, more
than they were able to accept.

Since each member of the quar-
tet belonged to the Male Chorus,
Mr. Plott arranged a spot for them
to sing in the Male Chorus con-
certs. This gave them an opportu-
nity to sing before large groups in
the South and Southwest on the
Male Chorus trip during spring
holidays.

Well known to Davidson stu-
dents is the Four Lamplighters’ ar-
rangement of “Mr. Sandman,”
which was done by Joe Garrison.
Most of their arrangements, how-
ever, are done by the entire
group. Their most recent one is
of “Blue Moon,” which they hope
to sing during one of the dances
of Spring Frolics this weekend.

A concrete indication of the
ability and success of the Four
Lamplighters is the fact that they
have been offered a chance to
make a recording. The offer is to
record “Decatur St. Blues,” a new
blues number by Chick Thompson,
on one side of a record, and any
selection they wish on the other
side. Their new arrangement of
“Blue Moon” will probably be the
selection.

They will be flown to Nashville
in mid-May to make the recording.
With coverage promised in two
nationally circulated magazines—
Vertety and Gillboard—there is a
definite possibility of substantial
royalties from the record.

Clearwater, Fla. is a senior, a
music major, and he plans to at-

Leighton McCutchen, first tenor,
a senior from Nashville, Tenn.,
also plans to attend Union Semi-
nary. He is a history major.

Joe Garrison, baritone, is a
junior from Greensboro, majoring
in English. He plans to attend
Princeton Theological.Seminary.

Bob Martin, lead, is a junior
from Welsh, La. majoring in
psychology. He will attend either
Princeton or Columbia Seminary.

The Four Lamplighters  re-
hearse three times a week for
about two hours. They practice
where ever they can find a place—
Shearer Hall, the church, or the
showers. They are genuinely sorry
to see two of their group leaving
because of graduation. As one
member put it, “We really get a
big kick out of being together and
singing together even when we
are just fooling around.”

Raleigh (Harold Hall), a youngster,
one week out of training camp,
have been detailed to lead a day-
light raid across No Man’s Land to
capture a German prisoner.

Judging by the horrible fate of
previous raids, even the Colonel
(Tom Mann) knows that their
mission is practically murder, for
the Germans dominate the situa-
tion so thoroughly that they mock-
ingly tie red rags beside the wire
where they know the raid is bound
to come. Raleigh is too inexperi-
enced to know how slight are his
chances of returning, but “Uncle”
Osborne understands completely.
Maintaining an undeceived and un-
deceiving coolness, he prepares for
the ultimate emergency.

What is most remarkable about
‘Journey's End” as a whole is Mr.
Sherriff's ability to underwrite
every scenec, to suggest black
peril behind the casualness of the
dialogue. In the last few minutes
that remain before this foredoomed
raid begins, the
achieved the most delicate dia-
logue of the play — doggedly
whimsical, full of suppressed ex-
citement, vibrant with mute de-
termination.

All of the men in ‘Journey's
End” are seen not as soldiers,
heroes, or villians, but as individ-
uals. With one exception each of
the officers, in this all male cast,
stands for something individually
so fine that it is difficult to choose
among them.

The war has made a hard drinker
of the naturally temperate Captain
Stanhope, played by Dunbar Ogden.
But for all this hard drinking to
steady shattered nerves, Captain
Stanhope is a resolute leader of

Duke University. An English ma-
jor, he has been active as an
executive editor of Seripts ‘n
Pranks this year, a member of
Philanthropic Literary Society, the
Forensic Council, Sigma Upsilon,
Alpha Psi Omega, and Tau Kappa
Alpha, and served as a managing
editor of Quips end Cranks and a
writer for the Davidsonten last
year.
FRED M. HUDSON

Fred, a Phi Delt from Miami,
Florida, has been awarded a $1200
assistantship in chemistry at the
University of Tennessee. He has
been vice president of the Concert
Band this year and solo trombonist
for the last two years, a first Heu-
tenant in ROTC, and is a member
of Scabbard and Blade, Gamma
Sigma Epsilon, and Phi Mu Alpha.
Fred's major is chemistry.

JACK H. KNOX

Jack, an ATO from Salisbury,
North Carolina, has also been
awarded a $1200 assistantship in
chemistry at the University of Ten-
nessee. Another chemistry major,
he is also in Gamma Sigma Epsilon.

The Committee on Graduate
Scholarships is very pleased with
the number of awards won this
year and it is expected that the
official announcements of several
more will be made in the near
future.

Big Spring Frolics ...
(Continued From Page One)

One foot behind Lochinvar’s elbow
sits his date.

Arriving at the informal dance,
which began an hour and a half
ago, as only unsophisticated fresh-
men appear at 8:00, the fashion
wise stud notices his cotton suit,
be it blue, grey, or blue-grey, is in
correct style. Scattered here and
there are accepted slacks, if they
are black, pleatless and belted you-
know-where, combined with a cord
coat to form a chick get up.

Flannagan’s fantasy leads us in-
to another dream night of Spring
Frolics, but the spell is broken at
the stroke of midnight. Come Mon-
day morning, the student dons
dirty bucks and his wrinkled
khakis to begin another week in
traditional Davidson vogue.

ing. For all his amusing obtuseness,
the corpulent Lieutenant Trotter
(Albert Harris), is responsible and
good natured under trying ordeals.
Lieutenant Raleigh becomes a
hero by instinctively following the
‘rules of fair play he has learned
on the soccer fields of England.

The greatness of this play ties
in its universality. It breaks the
bounds of 1918, for war has been
known to man since his beginning,
and is a part of each of us today.
Breaking even the bounds of war,
here are presented human beings
in conflict and under tension. Their
natures are stripped of superficiali-
ties, there can be no chain here.
The action and the idiom are
simple and direct and in these men
we find those we know—and we
find ourselves.

“Journey’s End” will be pre-
sented each evening at 8:15 p.m.
in Chambers Auditorium. Tickets
may be purchased at the box office,
Chambers foyer, before each per-
formance.
