Reduced faculty work loads?

According to Dean of Faculty Robert Williams, the new policy reducing
each professor’s course load to only five per year “brings Davidson into
conformity with other colleges.” Fine. However, Davidson students and
professors alike have long taken pride in the school’s unwillingness to fit the
norm.

The matter seems a tricky one to us. Reducing the course load will no
doubt have a ripple effect throughout the college, the foremost of which is
the inevitable reduction of courses offered each semester. At a school as
small as Davidson, where resources are limited by size and money, a wide
range of interesting classes is already hard to come by.

Even now it has been our experience that so few courses are being
offered this semester, we find ourselves sticking with courses inside our
major. Why? Because that is a subject we find interesting. To take

something else, the subject matter must be enticing. And for an English’

major to be convinced to tackle a biology course takes a lot of enticing. And
vice versa.

The diversity of courses offered will only decrease.

The administration, for its part, has promised to find the money needed
to hire more professors, and thus increase the diversity of courses to its
original level. We, however, are yet to be convinced that increasing the
number of professorships and keeping their required work load at a higher
level is not a better option.

We must concede that we are far from well versed in matters concerning
such administrative affairs. But it'seems that as students we have a right to
understand why we are being forced to suffer the licens this new plan
inherently brings with it.

Perhaps the answer lies in the increased attention each professor will be
able to pay their respective duties. But who knows. Teachers are people, too,
and free time is free time.

But the decision has already been made. And as is Davidson tradition,
it takes quite some time to change a decision once it has been carried out,
even if it is a bad one. Witness this year’s scheduling debacle. So we can
only implore the administration and the professors to hold up their side of the
bargain: do find the money to create new professorships, do spend more time
with students, and do pay more attention to teaching. Judging by the

standards of many of today's colleges and universities, there is no need to fit
the norm.

College shouldn't accept tobacco money.

To the editors,

Tama 1977 graduate
and Presidentof the Virginia
Group to Alleviate Smoking
in Public (GASP).

I am disturbed to read
in the Davidson Journalthat
the college is prostituting it-
self by accepting a
$100,000.00 grant from
Philip Morris, the world’s
largest drug lord.
Smokingisnowblamed
for one out of every five
deaths in America. Tobacco
companies work aggres-
sively to addict young chil-

dren tothis product both here —

and abroad, then sell them
their drug until it kills them.
I have seen giant pictures of
the Marlboro man on bill-
boards in squalid third-world
villages.

In South America, vans
with cigarette logos distrib-
ute free samples to junior
high school students and of-
fer a light on the spot.

The Philip Morris grant
serves the same public rela-
tions purposes as their spon-
sorship of sporting events
and gifts to such charities as
the United Negro College
Fund. Such smoke-screens

are an attempt to buy legiti-
macy and divert: attention.
from their deadly drug push-
ing.

Tobacco companies
have recently concentrated
their efforts on minorities,
who statistically smoke at a
higher rate than whites and
have a far higher death rate
from lung cancer. Those

minority students at
Davidson who accept the
Philip Morris funds should
know that they are being used
big time.

Sincerely,

Hinton Oliver ‘77

Thanks to community for 3rd world help.

(Chaplain

McKelway corrects Statement article.

To the editors,

Thank you for an infor-
mative article on the State-
ment of Purpose issue. One
correction, however, needs
to be made. The much dis-
cussed first two sentences of
the second paragraph of the
proposed Statement do not

all religions,” nor do I be-
lieve that “acceptance of
other beliefs is a natural re-

present “an affirmation of -

sult of Davidson’s Christian

_ heritage” as your reporter

claims.

The proposed Statement
says that “the loyalty of the
college extends .. . to the

whole human community .
and includesopenness to and :
respect for the world's vari-

ous religious traditions.”
“Openness” and
“respect” are quite different

from “affirmation” and ' “ac.

ceptance.” — ,
ex Because the experience

_ of God isalways specific, no

particular faith could affirm

“all religions,” but in so far

as it is God who is known (a
God captive neither to
church nor creed), any au-
thentic faith would have to

* be open and respectful to-

ward others.
Sincerely, —
A.J. McKelway
