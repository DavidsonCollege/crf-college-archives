EPC Ponders Issue
Of Grading Deletions

By ANDY LAMAS
Senior News Editor -
Two significant proposals
concerning academic
regulations are now under
consideration by the
Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC). They will be
decided upon by a vote in next
Monday’s meeting of that
committee.
The two proposals are:
(1) To lengthen the course

drop period from one-tenth to
one-half of the term (from one

week to five).

(2) To delete a failing grade
from the grade point average
once that failed course has
been repeated and to include
in the grade point average

computation only the repeated
course guide.
Vice President for

Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan said that the- proposals
will again be discussed in
Monday’s meeting of the EPC
before the final vote is taken.

drop period is one of the prin-
cipal issues now facing the
EPC,”’ he said. -

The majority of the EPC
members support lengthening
the drop period to two weeks.
A two week drop period was
college registration policy in
the early 1970's.

It was brought up in the last
meeting of the committee that
a longer drop period is not
necessary if the student is able
to determine how he is doing
early in the term.

The student members of the
committee to this
saying that students often do
not know how they are doing in
a course until many weeks in-
to the term because many

professors are delinquent in
grading and_ returning
reviews.

As a result of this, Bevan
issued a memorandum to all
faculty members, advising
them of a new college policy
on this matter. The memoran-
dum states that no professor
will be able to give a review
until he has graded the
previous one and returned it to
the students.

In its last meeting, the EPC
also passed two extended
studies proposals. The first is
that a student may now post-
pone extended studies 301 until
his senior year, if such action
is warranted by the nature of
the project. A postponement

and because of the growing in-

hasbecome essential to an in-

and universities.

Davis Grant Boosts
Renovation Funds

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

Davidson has just received
4 grant of $50,000 specifically
St eet for ine renovation
Significantly, this is the fit
gift designated just for the
creation of a new college
union.

The Florida based Arthur
Vining Davis Foundation is
the source. of this con-
signment. Davis, its philan-
thropic founder, became
president of the Aluminum
Company of America in 1910.
He later advanced to Chair-
man of the Board of Alcoa and
was renowned as a director of
humerous major corporations
and as a Florida business
magnate.

Director of Development
Donald Winston has indicated
that the Davis Foundation “‘is
one of several institutions that
Davidson has applied to for
funds.”’ These applications
are presently pending.
Notably, the Davis grant has
been under consideration for
2% years.

This lengthy wait was

due to the Foun-
dation’s national popularity.

During the broadcast, there will be a short two-minute in-
formational film on Davidson College.

Davidson was assigned to a
waiting list of institutions
seeking an endowment. Win-
ston noted that the Davis
Foundation has always been
generous to small liberal arts
colleges similiar to Davidson.

The Davis Foundation has
concentrated the grants
program in private education,
medicine and religion. Its
avowed is to ‘‘em-
phasize the institution’s own
goals, and its progress in im-

them, rather than
the merits of a
proposal which has been sub-
mitted.”

Winston observed that in
this case the Foundation was
given a “shopping list"’ of the
college’s needs. The Davis
Foundation finally decided to
allocate $50,000 to ‘‘convert
the old library into a student
center,’’ in the words of the
Foundation’s Trustees.

“The renovation of Grey
Library is the college’s first
priority,” according to Win-
Ston.

Assistant’ to the President
Rich Wilson noted that with
this grant the college ‘‘won't
have to take that amount from
the budget.”’
