Drama production explores the horror of the Vietnam War

By WILL RAGLAND
Staff Writer

Last week the Davidson Col-
lege Theatre Department presented
Strange Snow, a play by Stephen
Metcalfe, in the Black Box The-
atre. It centers around three char-
acters, two friends trying to cope
with a painful past and one of the
friend’s sister, who has her own'set
of problems. The story is set in the
Midwest, in the early 1980’s, on
opening day of the fishing season.
There is a “wondrous strange
snow” on the ground. The two
friends’ names are Megs and David,
both veterans of Vietnam who can’t
escape the horror of an experience
that has left a permanent impact on
their lives. Martha is David’s sis-
ter and they live together in their
childhoodhome. Marthaisaschool
teacher and lives a sad, reclusive
life. The story is one of change,
reconciliation, discovery, and love.

_I found this play to be truly .

moving and emotionally power-
ful. The acting was superb and the
set was impressive as well. It was
definitely a play centered on the
individual characters, one that fo-
cused on relationships between
humans and how our lives can be
shaped by past experiences. The
play had so much feeling and artis-
tic qualities that added to its over-
all excellence. It made one really
think about the lives of these people
and how they were changed in the
context of a day.
_ Josh Gaffga played the part of
‘Megs, a zany truck driver who was

sometimes called Jackknife. Josh’s
portrayal of Megs was commend-
able. Josh was both comically
entertaining and touching at times.
He took the character to its fullest
extent and did it well.. In his char-
acter was a man trying to embrace
his past and live beyond the pain
that had affected his life in so many
ways. He came to visit his friend
and go fishing on opening day.
Megs was full of enthusiasm and
friendliness. He loved people, es-
pecially his old Vietnam pal Davy.
Megs was always cracking jokes,
dancing around, planning to do fun
things, and remembering good
times. As the play developed,
Megs’ inner struggles were re-
vealed and his air of happiness was
often a wall behind which lay the
emotional scars of war and death.
Inside was conflict, a battle Megs
was trying to win, and trying to
overcome.

Dominick Talvacchio played
David, a depressed drinker whose
life has been destroyed by his ex-
periences in Vietnam. Dominick
did an excellent job playing the
part of David. He convincingly
portrayed a man overcome by his
past. He showed in his character
the intense conflict that had shaped
his life. David was a person who
was drinking his life away, ver-
bally abusing his hard-working sis-
ter and showing malice towards
all, even his friend Megs. He con-
tinuously dwelled on his accom-
plishments in high school and his
failure as a man. His relationship
to Megs was interesting. He out-
wardly hated him because Megs

_ the shadows.

was such a physical symbol of the
pain that was burdening his life,
but eventually their relationship
became one of reconciliation.
Philippa Finch played the part

‘of Martha, David’s lonely sister.

Philippa’s portrayal of Martha was
equally impressive. She showed
in her character a woman how
lived a disappointing life, having
todeal with both her spiteful brother
and her own personal failures. Her
life was one of endless monotony
until Megs came onto the scene
and gave her an opportunity for
change. She was never a pretty or
popular girl and always stood in
She hated herself
and her shortcomings and had de-
cided to-settle for a lonely life.
Megs became the doorway through
which Martha could find the per-
son she wanted to be. In spite of
her brother’s discouraging words
and warnings, she persisted in
changing her outlook on life and
her physical appearance. She found
acceptance and love in Megs and
began to discover her own beauty
through him.

The play left me with a sense
of reflection as I thought about the
symbolic and conflicting aspects
of it. It told a story that enveloped
the concepts of human interaction,
soul-searching, and rebirth. It was
truly a play that took the audience
on an emotional roller coaster. It
was excellent in the way it took on
many of the complexities of life in
a simple way. It was a story worth
telling and the actors’ portrayal of
it wa something to be applauded.
