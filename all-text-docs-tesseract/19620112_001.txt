“Even before Rusk’s appoint-
ment, when he was president of
the Rockefeller Foundation,”
commented R. J. Sailstad, as-
sistant to the president, “efforts
were made to obtain him as a
speaker. When the appoinment
was made, he still indicated in-
terest in coming, but the time
had to be suited to his heavy
schedule.

Rusk is a member of David-
son’s Board of Visitors. This is
his second visit to the campus
‘in recent years as a speaker,
since he spoke to the student
body some four years ago.

Rusk, the son of a Presbyter-
ian minister, worked two years
in an Atlanta law office before
coming to Davidson and enter-
ing upon a busy schedule of
study, work, and extra-curricu-
lar activities.

While earning his Phi Beta
Kappa key and a Rhodes Schol-
arship, Rusk, better known as
“Elijah,” put himself through
school by working as a clerk in
the local bank in the afternoons
and by waiting tables at a board-

| ing house.

Council
Approves
By-Law

The Student Council voted
Wednesday night to pass a pro-
posed by-law to the Student
Body Constitution concerning
the possession of pistols on
campus and the keeping of fire-
arms in automobiles.

This move was a follow-up to
the recent approval by a 313 to
93 vote of the student: body of
the council-proposed amend-
ment to the Constitution which
banned firearms from fraternity
houses.

The new by-law reads as fol-
lows: “Permission is granted by
the Student Council for students
to keep their firearms in the
gun room located in the base-
ment of Belk dormitory or in
the trunks of their automobiles.
Permission will not be granted
for the possession of pistols u:1-
der any circumstances.”

The council also voted to send
nine delegates from the student
body to the State Student Legis-
lature in Raleigh on March 8-10
in the spring.

Vagabonds’ Plan
Next Production

Looking

forward to next semester, Prof. J. A.

Sneden, director of the Vagabonds, reports that the group
is optimistically making plans for their production of
George Bernard Shaw’s Androcles and the Lion and also
for the dramatic festivals which will follow.

Androcles and the Lion, to be
presented February 21, 22, and
23, will feature a “cast of
thousands.” .“We can use as
many extras as we can get.”
said Sneden, “Roman cohorts,
Christian prisoners, and of
course, the lion.”

For those “thousands” inter-
ested, Sneden said that tryouts
for the play will be held Mon.,
Jan. 29 at 8 p.m., and then again
on Tuesday both after drill and
also that night at 8.

The Vagabonds plan to make
their own costumes under the
direction of Mr. Courtney Hill,
a former Davidson graduate who
designed costumes for the off

Broadway play Little Mary Sun-
shine and for the Charlotte
Music Theater this summer.

In the latter part of March
the Vagabonds will be hosts for
the Carolina Dramatic Associs-
tion district festival of one act
plays. Sneden plens to use as
Davidson's entry a group of ori-
gine! plays written by Davidson
students.

In April the Vagabonds will
travel to Chapel Hill for the
CDA state festival of one-act
plays. and if time permits they
will present another play on
campus near the end of the
semester. .

Faculty Approves Proposal
For Liberalized Cut Policy

Integration Poll Taken:

BY TOM LOFLIN
Devidsonian Staff Writer

A revised cut system passed the faculty at an action-filled meeting last Tuesday
afternoon. To go into effect next fall, the new system was proposed by a faculty

committee headed by Prof.

“Everyone seemed to have
his own ideas on different as-
pects of the new rules,” Dr.
Martin said. But the regulations
that were finally decided upon
go far toward giving students
here greater freedom than éver
before.

VOTE ON INTEGRATION

The faculty also discussed an-
other policy of significance to
Davidson—the question of in-
tegration. A proposal had been
made at the last faculty meet-
ing by an interested group of
professors that the question be
voted upon at the meeting of
Jan. 9. A vote. was taken; how-
ever, Dr. Martin declined to
comment on the outcome.

President Martin told DAVID-
SONIAN interviewers, “If the
Trustees were to see the results
announced in the paper, they
might think that the faculty is
trying to dictate to them. The
outcome of the vote will be an-
nounced to the Board of Trust-
ees before any official state-
ment is given for publishing. It
is up to them alone to decide
the official policy of the college
on a matter of this type.” |

President Martin also stress-
ed that the outcome of the vote
is merely the opinion of the
faculty on whether or not David-
son should open its doors to
students of all races. and that
its results in no way indicate
what action the trustees will
take.

“ABSENCE” REGULATIONS

In a prepared statement given
to the DAVIDSONIAN, the new
cut regulations were discussed
in full. Dr. Martin said that he
preferred to call’them “absence”
regulations because, “Officially
no more cuts will be given in
classes.”

The regulations, which go into
effect next September, enable
any student to cut up to 25 per

cent of the scheduled mectings
of a class without loss of quality
points. Any student who, for any
reason, cuts more than 25 per
cent automatically fails the
course, as has been the policy
in the past.
No special adjustments will be
made for work missed because
of absences, and all grade re-
ports issued by the Registrar
will list the snumber of ab-
sences in each course. Absences
due to late registration will
count against the 25 per cent
limit. The Executive Committee
of the Faculty ‘has been em-
powered to make decisions on
any absences which the regula-
tions do not cover.
STIPULATIONS ADDED
Several important stipulations
concerning absences have been
put into the new regulations,
however. The most important
for all students is the fact that
each individual professor is

s

authorized to impose his own.

attendance on
students.

Another stipulation is that no
absences will be allowed from
any classes on the last two days
before or the first two days
after any holiday of more than
one day. Any absences taken on
these days would have to be ex-
cused by the Dean of Students.
At ‘rresent, Homecoming would
be the only holiday for which
the rule would not apply.

Attendance will be required
for the following: all academic
exercises, if a student is on
probation; all tests assigned in
advance; and all semester exam-
inations. No professor can give
a make-up review or exam with-
out an excuse from the Dean of

requirements

Students, arid the excuse will.

not be given unless the absence
is because of circumstances be-
yond the student’s control.
UNAFFECTED AREAS
The new regulations do not

_ apply to vespers, chapel, or phy-

sical education. The cut rules
previously governing these ex-
ercises will remain in effect.

Tke new rules allow the Pro-
fessor of Military Science and
Tactics to establish his own
policy for ROTC drill. When.
asked if there would be any
changes made in the rules cover-
ing cuts from drill, Col. Whea-
ten gave the answer in two
words: “Status quo.”

To conclude the meeting, it
was announced that the college
has raised $700,000 toward the
challenge grant made by the
Richardson Foundation for fa-
culty salaries. This means that
the foundation will give David-
son $233,000, matching our
every $3 with $1 of theirs.

MEN

Midwiniers Concert
Brings Highwaymen

Midwinters festivities will begin Friday night, Feb.
16, with an informal dance to the rock and roll music of
Heuy Smith and the Clowns. The IFC had planned to have
Shirley and Lee, but because they couldn’t arrange
enough dates in this area, they declined to come.

The Highwaymen, made popu-
lar by their Negroq folk song
“Michael,” will give a concert
Saturday afternoon. These five
honor seniors from Wesleyan
University in. Connecticut joined
together their. freshman year
and now’ sing only folk music.

They sing in four languages to
the accompaniment of instru-
ments including a “ten-string
South American  charango”
made of an armadillo shell and
a Nigerian talking drum. The
group’ includes Wesleyan’s
champion pole-vaulter and the

campus radio station announcer.
A Mexican garbageman taught
one of them to play the guitar.

The price of the Midwinters
entertainment will be about
$4.50. $3 less than Homecoming
was. In keeping with the tradi-
tion of the past, classes will be
held on Saturdav. But not every-
one plans to follow tradition.
Said IFC president.Bob Waugh,
“Tll regret not being able to
attend class, but Charlotte suits
me better.” There will be no
dance Saturday night.
