Off-campus houses
broken into

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

As usual, burglars made a
timely appearance at several off
campus houses. Apparently, these
burglars were having trouble wak-
ing up. They took at least five
alarm clocks, and little else.

One target was 210 Watson
Street. As the three residents re-
turned late in the night, they found
that someone had been in the house.

Amber Huffman, a resident of
the house, says, “I didn’t even re-
ally notice that anything was wrong
until I noticed my answering ma-
chine was missing and some furni-
ture was turned over.”

The burglars took some
clothes and the clocks, but didn’t

take anything valuable. Luckily,
most students took their expensive
possessions with them or packed
them up for winter break.

Huffman and other residents
of 210 Watson called the police as
soon as they realized that their
house had been broken into. A
special “crime team” of police took
fingerprints and comforted the vic-
tims.

“The police were very helpful
and responded right away. They
were very nice, especially consid-
ering the fact that it was about 4:30
in the morning,” says Huffman.

“It’s not that much of a shock

thing to ) worry about.”

Next door, on Depot street,
Jesse Kenner came back to find
that his house had been burglar-
ized as well.

The burglars took alarm
clocks, a jar of change, a calcula-
tor, and a pillowcase. They also

broke a phone cord. They didn’t

take the computer or the two TV’s
that the three residents had left
there.

The burglary apparently took
place on Christmas Eve. They had
locked a lot of their things up in
dorm rooms on campus.

“Tt was pretty funny,” says
Kenner, “when we discovered that
a pillowcase was missing. They
must have used it to take the alarm
clocks.”
