Better Lighting Is

By Chris Hood

Looking around the 900 Room
during “Take Back the Night” last
Tuesday, I noticed that far more
women than men were in atten-
dance. This was no great surprise,
but it leads to another point | find
interesting and, perhaps, disheart-
ening.

As the crowd began somberly
exiting the 900 Room, I walked
over to the table where the SGA
Security Committee’s Petition for
Better Campus Lighting was being
presented by Jonathan Orr. Obvi-
ously, with the abundance of
women present Tuesday, the vast
majority of the signatures were

women’s.

I began to wonder how re-
sponsive Davidson men would be
if offered a similar opportunity to
sign the petition. That evening, I
presented the sheet to a number of
men, many of whom eagerly
signed. Still, a significant number
chose not to sign the document,
claiming that lighting was adequate
or that the College would do better
to spend its money elsewhere.

Personally, I generally feel
safe most anywhere I walk oncam-
pus, regardless of the time of day.
My experience shows that far more
men than women share this senti-
ment.

Since I began my Davidson
career, I have heard an increasing
number of stories about students

-being harassed and assaulted on

campus, often in dimly-lit areas.
How many of these stories are fact
and how many are fiction I do not
know, but I am beginning to won-
der whether my feeling of security
is legitimate ora sign of ignorance.
I fear the latter is becoming more
valid.

Better campus lighting would
hardly terminate all assaults and
fears, but I can’t help but think it
would lessen the chances of such
events. After a long period of stu-
dent lobbying, more lights have

been erected, particularly between
Belk and Chambers. But walk from
the library to the Union, and you’d
better watch your step; you may
not notice the steps. I know many
students who will not walk down
the hill alone at night. Mostevery-
one seems to have suggestions on
strategic locations where lighting
and safety are probably propor-
tionally linked.

While we often think of
women as being the victims of
assaults, men are certainly not im-
mune. Though many menareaware
of this fact, too many are not. Bet-
ter lighting and security are not
just women’s issues; they are cam-

Essential for Campus Safety

pus issues. Icannot claim that more
lighting will stop such crimes from
occurring, but it seems that greater
visibility will be a deterrent in a
number of cases.

Far too often, we act retroac-
tively; itisn’t until after something
terrible has occurred that we take
steps to prevent it from happening
again. Insufficientlighting has con-
tributed to various assaults oncam-
pus in the past; this must be a
concern of men as well as women.
If you haven’t had the opportunity
to sign a petition or stand up in
favor of more and better lighting,
please look for such an occasion.
In the meantime, watch your back.

Seay Rations...

A Liberal
At Last

By Nathan Seay

I’m sure that the foremost
question on everyone’s mind last
week was: ““Where is Nathan’s ar-
ticle?” I apologize for the incred-
ible turmoil I subjected most of
this campus to. Without your
weekly dose of yours truly, I’m
sure that many of you failed tests,
blew off papers, and maybe a few
of you flew into a bloodthirsty
rage, bludgeoning your roommate
with your Norton Anthology.
(Maybe. I’m exaggerating a bit. I
think maybe two people asked me
about it.)

(The nextfew paragraphs have
a “devil’s advocate” character in
it, so don’t let that throw you.
You're all gifted students. You
can handle it.)

But I’m-extremely—excited
about my being censored. “Why
are you so proud that you wrote
something so terrible that it can’t
be put in the paper?” Well, I’1l tell
you. I have joined the ranks of
Perry Farrell and Robert
Mapplethorpe. “Are you coming
out of the closet?” No, silly. I’m
trying to tell you that I’m now an
oppressed artist. “You call that
crap you write art?” YesI do. This
is how I express myself; so there.

Itis every liberal’s dream to be put
down, to be censored. At last I’m
officially a left winger. “And
you're really happy about that?”
Shut up. “You can’t make me.
You’re a pacifist.” Yeah, well...

“At least satisfy my curiosity.
Whaton earth could you have writ-
ten about that was worse than un-
derage drinking, picking your nose,
farting, or having sex with dead
people? All that stuff got by the
censors.” Well, I can’t exactly tell
you. I’llgive yousome hints. You

. do it when you’ re alone. “Sleep?”

No, but it makes you sleepy. “Jog-
ging?” No. Jerry Seinfeld devoted
an episode of his show to it. “Oh.

That. What were you thinking?
Don’t you have any pride?” Not
according to some of the stories
I’ve heard.

It just happens that I watched
JFK the other-day,-and-I-started
putting two and two together. I
listened very closely to Donald
Sutherland and started asking my-
self just who benefitted from the
omission of my article. I was de-
termined to get to the bottom of
what was obviously a conspiracy.

The first group of people who

wouldn’t want this article tocome .

out would be females. They
wouldn’t want me to blow open
this taboo subject. I backed it up

with facts and figures. The women
were scared. They didn’t: want me
to blow their cover. Fine, girls.
Just remember next time I’m play-
ing I Never with any of you, I know
at least-three-fourths-of you-are
lying.

The Catholic church was an-
other part of the conspiracy. They
didn’t wantme advertising the ben-
efits ofa venial sin, especially since
I’m one of their flock. Maybe it’s
because I’ma white male. Perhaps
the newspaper staff thought that
the WASCs (sorry, I’ma Catholic)
get too much coverage in this pa-
per. Or maybe it’s just because
I’ma bleeding heart liberal and the

paper is run by a bunch of guys
who actually think that Ronald
Reagan was a good President.

If some of you want to read
the article anyway, please ask me;
and-l’ll give-you-a-copy.—It’s not
that graphic, I swear. The “m”
word isn’t even mentioned once.
Don’t be shy. I’d be incredibly
flattered- if some total stranger
walked up to me and said, “Hey,
aren’t you the guy...” (If I look
scared at this point, don’t worry.
I’m probably just frightened that
you’re going to tell me something
about last Friday. Just continue
with your question.) I'll be more
than happy to help you.

Reduced Teaching Load Improves Academic Life

Berkey continued from page 5

something thatcan only come about
- through diligent reading and re-
search. By extention, the expan-
sion of our intellectual horizons
depends upon the research and
writing of women and men such as
those on the faculty at Davidson,
as well as their peers at other insti-
tutions of highter education.
Moreimportantly, teaching at
the post-secondary level involves
more than merely transmitting in-
formation, however currentand up-
to-date. Itinvolves demonstrating
to students what it means to “do”
history, or physics, or economics.
It involves showing students how
and why one explores a particular
question or issue within the con-

fines of a particular discipline, how
and why one can hope to achieve,
through hard work, some better
understanding of the world.

It is for these reasons that be-
ing involved in a disciplined pro-
gram of reading and research, what
I have heard termed an "active life
of the mind,” can be essential to
discharging one's teaching duties
atan institution like Davidson. To

~putit succinctly; to bea professor;

one must have something to pro-
fess. Indeed, Davidson's long-
standing "Code of Faculty Evalua-
tion Procedures" recognizes this
imperative.

This is not to say that research
alone producesa good teacher. Nor
is it to say that Davidson should
expect its professors to produce X

number of books and Y number of
articles every few years.

Mr. Windham betrays an un-
familiarity with what most aca-
demic publishing involves when
he glibly labels it “worthless,” but
the quality of one’s “life of the
mind” need not, and in many cases
should not be measured by the
number of words committed to
print.

The quality of thatintellectual
life, for the encouragement of
which an institution such as
Davidson exists, does, however,
requireconsiderable blocks of time.
Therein lies a compelling justifi-
cation for a five-course teaching
load.

There is another more practi-
cal matter which Mr. Windham,

and those who share his opinions,
would do well to bear in mind. The
value of their degrees from
Davidson College will depend
upon the reputation of the College.
That reputation, in turn, depends
almostentirely on the professional
standing of those who teach here.
Like it or not, in the real world, the
professional standing of this or any
other faculty rests squarely on the
extentand quality ofits program of
research.

That is why a five-course
teaching loadis by nomeans slack,
by the standards of those institu-
tions to which Davidson likes to
compare itself. To take one popu-
lar yardstick: many of those insti-
tutions ranked among the top 25
“national liberal arts colleges” by

U.S. News and World Report re-
quire their faculty to teach only
four courses per year, not five.
These schools are recognized as
excellent, not because of their fac-
ulty members teach fewer courses,
but because teaching fewercourses
allows them the time ot develop
their own excellence, and to en-
courage it in their students.

If some feel strongly that the
measure of a college’s excellence
is to be found in the number of
courses individual professors teach
there are plenty of institutions
which set a teaching load of seven,
or even eight courses per year.
Davidson, however, has chosen a
different path to quality. 4

Sincerely,
Jonathan Berkey
