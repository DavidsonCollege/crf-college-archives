devil Bob Bourne, Davidson might
Have been resigned to following in
the dreary convention of football,
basketball, and the rest. However,
after viewing Bourne’s remarkable
achievements since coming to D.C., |}
college officials have begun to
seriously consider inserting some
modified form of racing in the
sports curriculum.

The student responsible for all
this, despite his phenomenal rec-
ords in the Morning Boardinghouse
Run and the Huntersville-to-Char.
lotte International, is actually the
antithesis of the boisterous tone
usually associated with racing. |,
Most of his spare time is spent
calmly before a TV screen or at
one of the flicks on the Moores-
ville-China Grove-Kannapolis-Con-
cord circuit, where his appearances
are as unexpected as a McGeachy
writ. Described by an anonymous
fraternity brother as resembling
Submariner, “but with an olive-
drab effect,” and exuding a strange,
almost Oriental charm, the smooth,
soft-spoken Bourne is reputedly a
pretty fast man either on or off
the track. As a matter of fact, his
somewhat large female following
has earned him the dubious title
of Ahab the Arab.

Whatever his other activities,
Bourne is at his best behind the
wheel of his 98 Olds. The story
of his climb to racing fame begins
at the Darlington Speedway where.
at the age of three, little Abab
piloted his suped-up Montgomery-
Ward kiddicar to second place in
the midget auto race, only to be
disqualified for improper registra-
tion. Undaunted, he pursued his
first love diligently until today
he is one of the most feared drivers
since Mauri Rose.

At present he is a most vigorous
exponent for the establishment of
auto racing as a major sport at
Davidson. Speaking before the
Wildcat Club several days ago, his
suggestion for altering Richardson

judo and weightlifting), Ahab’s de-
votion to automobiles is exempli-
fied in the homecoming incident
when he discovered a ping in the
motor during a dance intermission
and sacrificed the remainder of the
evening to tuning up the motor
behind Watts dorm.

Field to accommodate a midget
speedway was highlighted with a
plea for progress, “Why lag be-
hind when such contemporaries as
Stetson, Rollins, and Miami are of-
fering degrees as well as letters
in this great American sport? This
is Davidson’s greatest opportunity
in national sorts since 1837.”

never letting the Cadets penetrate
within the fifteen yard-line. They
turned in thelr best performance
of the season despite the absence
of six key men who didn’t make
the trip because of sub-par grades.

In the first quarter, Tom Lee set
up the first Davidson touchdown
when he recovered a Citadel fum-
ble.. The tally followed shortly
when Dyke Little completed a pass
to McRee. In the second period,
McRee scored again for the Kit-
tens, this time on a_ five-yard
spring. The half ended with Da-
vidson ahead, 12-0.

In the final period of ptay, the
Davidson team added another
touchdown when McRee snagged a
pass from Dick Bolton. Don Camp-
bell added the extra point, and
Davidson led, 19-0.

For the freshmen, the game
marked the end of a very success-
ful season. Working together for
the first time, the frosh lost only
to the Furman freshman team.
They have claimed victories over
McCallie, Gordon Military Acad-
emy, and The Citadel.

FOR THE SOPHOMORES

There is at the present time a
question before the upper three
classes of the student body which,
although it may seem to affect
only the members of the senior
class with any degree of import-
ance, should be of direct concern
to the sophomores es well. ' The
question regards the diploma which
will be presented to each graduat-
ing senior at commencement this
year and to each of us as we are
graduated in the spring of 1956.

Shortly after the founding of our
college in 1837, a beautiful
diploma, designed by Peter Stuart
Ney, was adopted as the official
diploma by the college and was
awarded to members of the first
graduating class in 1840. In accord-
ance with trends which were
prevalent in 1930, this traditional
document was abandoned in favor
of a modernized diploma, which
has been used since that time. The
1930 version” of the diploma not
only lacked the full Davidson tradi-
tion but is also printed upon a
sheepskin the size of which is al-
together too large for practical
purposes. This fact and others have
been realized by a number of
members of the student body who
are now urging that we adopt this
year a diploma which will bear
all of the original tradition of the
Ney design and will be printed
upon sheepskin of a more practi-
cal size.

In order to accomplish this aim
it. will be necessary for two-thirds
of the potential voters of the three
upper classes to cast a ballot in
favor of the change. Each of you
will have the opportunity to vote
Monday morning, November 16.

This is not so much an effort to
solicit your support of the meas-
ure, although I personally feel that
the change will be worthwhile, as
it is an appeal to you to cast your
ballot whether it be pro or con.
You have the opportunity to voice
your opinion; make use of it! .

ready for varsity action next year,
and has given the coaches a chance
to see their potential stars of 1954.

The YMCA Bible Class whicn
meets each Sunday morning at
10:00 has set up its program a bit
differently this year than in the
past. Realizing the need of the
students here at Davidson for an
interdenominational, voluntary re-
ligious service for Bible study, the
Bible Class seeks to offer the stu-
dents a worship service which they
themselves plan and carry out.

At the beginning of the school
year the students were presented |::
with several ideas for study ma-|*
terial for the year. It was decided | ;

that the class would use Bernard
Anderson's “The Unfolding Drama
of the Bible” as a basis for the
first part of the year’s study. This

guidebook offered a sweeping look j.

at the total message of the Bible.
Various students have spoken on
the main ideas of six of the eight
lessons and led the class in a dis-
cussion following that. There are
two more lessons remaining in this
particular series, one concerning
the Christian church’s duty in the
world and the other concerning
history's finale.

Although a traditional institu-
tion here at Davidson, the Bible
Class has the aim of presenting its
program in a contemporaneous
light, helping with the present day
problems of the students. Would
that the students might realize
this aim and take an active in-
terest in the program. The class
is always open to suggestions from
sincerely interested persons as to
its program and its procedure.
There is an active interest on the
campus but this interest is stem-
med by other situations and prob-
lems. Too much organized worship
in a compulsory form is foremost
among the problems facing a group
like this that desires to offer vol-
untary worship and study. The
Sunday School, which Is an integral
part of the church and very im-
portant at all age levels, can be
a vital and living fellowship seek-
ing the Christian way of life and
its implications for the individual
and society.

We realize that there has been
failure in part, at least, of the
Bible Class in meeting its respon-
sibility to the needs of the campus.
We believe, however, that there
are those who haven't recognized

at Davidson and for preparation
for their life in the future.

It is our hope that others who
share in the idea of an interde-
nominational, voluntary worship
and study group will stop and con-
sider carefully the tremendous po-
tentiality for a group such as the
Bible Class here on the campus.

fer discrimination in many fields,

one of which is medical care.

This hospital is sponsored by
all the Protestant denominations in
Portugal so that non-Catholies can
get good medical care and treat-
ment. At the present time it is
the only such hospital on the en-
tire Iberian peninsula. A group of
Protestant doctors have offered
their services to the hospital for
a very small salary.

Most of the money necessary for
the construction of the building
has already been raised, and the
Davidson contribution would go
for the purchase of equipment.

In reality, the Davidson contribu-
tion would be larger than the
amount donated because the fav-
orable rate of exchange on the
American dollar in Portugal makes
it worth more than a dollar there.

(Continued From Page Three)

Steve Korcheck, linebacker, and
George Dancu were the main de-
fensive standouts for George
Washington and are expected to
give the Cats some trouble in the
line Saturday.

Good Passing

George Washington has a very
good passing attack as evidenced
by their encounter last week, ex-
celling Maryland by completing 8
of 19 tosses for 75 yards.

Bob Sturn of Muskogee, Okla-
homa, a sophomore quarterback,
will probably spearhead the
Colonials’ attack along wtih ends
Richie Gaskell and Dick Gaspari.

The Wildcats will start the game
tomorrow without the assistance
of backs Leroy Fargason and Jim
Shelton. Fargason is practicing
with the team, but won't be able
to start because of injuries: Shel-
ton, right halfback, is out with a
charley horse.

Corky: Burdette who has been
improving all through the season,
will be a starter against the
Colonials tomorrow for the first
time this season.

Citadel Next

The team after meeting George
Washington will face the Citadel
next Saturday in the closing game
of the season here on the David-
son gridiron.

The 1954 football schedule for
the Wildcats was released
Wednesday by Mr. Paul Scott,
athletic director. It was revealed
that the Cats will drop Georgia
Tech, Richmond, Harvard and
George Washington next year
from the schedule adding in their
place VMI, Florida State and Wof-
ford.

The schedule for 1954 will be as
follows:

ish Bennett, Max Devane,
Phi Delts

Ish Bennett, and Max Devane
were named from the Phi Delt
squad which tied the Sigma Chis
for first place. Max served as
quarterback and also was a good
defender due to his speed. Ish,
another basketball player who
didn’t see action in the last games,
was a top scorer for the Phi Delts
as well as being an_ all-round
player.

“Pappy” Fowle, KAs

The final position on the dream-
team is held down by “Pappy”
Fowle, the KAs versatile athlete.
Until dropping out due to basket-
ball practice, Pappy ran and passed
the KAs into contention for one
of the top places. Pappy usually
had a hand in all of the scoring.

The next seven boys in the vot-
ing were named to the second
string all-campus team. They are
as follows: Hobby Cobb, Kappa Sig,
a sophomore, also a varsity basket-
ball player; Grahame Keith, senior
standout for the Betas, along with
Tommy Lamb, junior, who excelled
on defense for the Betas; Dan
Leach, junior, all-around star for
the champion Phi Delts; Corky

the Conference meet with two wins,
one tie, and three losses. They
have defeated William and Mary
and Richmond, while tying Mary-
ville, and losing to N.C. State,

metals will be presented.

man for this section of the county and for Davidson College.

Christmas seals will be delivered
by mail to the students on Novem-
ber 16, and the seal sale will con-
tinue through December. The 1953
seal features the face of a sing:
ing child, wearing red mittens and
a green stocking cap and muffler,
and holding an open book of carols.

“As warmly personal as the chil-
dren singing carols at your door,
the 1953 Christmas Seal will bring
a happier and more meaningful
Christmas to everyone who pur-
chases them,” said Mr. Sapp, re-
calling the 1500-year-old tradition
of singing associated with the
Christmas season.

“A new song will be added to
our Christmas repertoire this
holiday season,” Mr. Jack Johnston,
general chairman of the 1953
Christmas Seal Sale reported.
Rodgers and Hammerstein, co-
authers of musical shows includ-
ing “Me and Juliet,” “South Paci-
fic,” and “Oklahoma,” have com-
bined their talents again to write
“Happy Christmas, Little Friend,”
the official song of the 1953 Seal
Sale.

‘Davidson students are perhaps
much closer to the tuberculosis
problem here in the county than
many of the county’s permanent
residents,” Mr. Sepp said. “Many
of them have helped entertain
patients at the nearby county sana-
torium, and they are well aware of
the good that is being done, and
can be done through the sale of
Christmas Seals.”

Davidson College students have
supported this worthy cause whole-
heartedly in previous years. Mr.
Sapp expressed his confidence that
this year would be a record-breaker
among the students in their sup-
port of this program. The county
goal of the 1953 Seal Sale is $44,-
037.50. This is based on the mini-
mum amourit needed to carry on
a worth-while and vigorous pro-
gram of tuberculosis control dur-
ing the coming year, in the fields
of case-finding, health education,

rehabilitation, scholarships, and
medical research.
-"I confidently believe that,

through generous purchases of
Christmas Seals, Davidson College
students and other residents of
Mecklenburg County will give the
green light for a much more inten-
sive effort aimed at wiping out
tuberculosis, the No. 1 killer among
infectious diseases,” Mr. Sapp said.

one of the best passers in the
Greek lengue; Perrin Anderson,
sophomore who helped spark the
Sigma Chis to first place; and Bob
Owen, senior, Pika, formed the
scoring punch for the Pikas along
with Bill Hanna.

The two teams were chosen by
the voting among the individual
players of each team. Each player
was entitled to seven votes with
seven players eligible from each
of the eleven Greek groups.

Three more games were played
this week and their results are
as follows:

Phi Delts 41, SARs 20

The Phi Delts downed the SAEs
in their season final by the score
of 41 to 20. Max Devane-and Dan
Leach where the stars in the Phi
Delt attack. Freshmen Dan Haley
and Buster Jenkins excelled for
the SAEs.

Phi Gams 19; ATOs 12

The Phi Gams directed by Char-
lie Hall, overcame a fast ATO team
and went on to a 19 to 12 victory.
Harold Riley and Watt Moore
snagged several passes and did
the scoring for the Phi Gams. Don
Massey and Phil Koonce were the
chief men in the ATO attack.

KAs 12, Betas 12
(KA win, overtime)

The KAs and the Betas battled
to a 12 to 12 tie in the regular
game and the KAs won the game
on the yardage in the overtime
period. In a fasting and exciting
game, Rosewell Mallory matched
passing ability with Eddie Schon-
berger of the KAs as both teams
fought evenly all the way with the
KAs gaining more yardage in the
overtime period.
