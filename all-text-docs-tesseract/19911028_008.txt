technical error, however, theauthor’ s name was not included. The edi-

MALEDICTION

(To the Scrawler of Swastikas on a Jewish Poster
Outside the Religion Department)

“Ha-ish attah” (2 Sam 12:7)

You drew a cursed sign and penned words
that have killed.
May this be your fate:

May the tool that marred carve emblems of shame
on your face and in your mind.

May you sicken at the sight of your own image,
frozen in that instant you took
pen to hand to destroy and deface.

You failed to sign your name.

May your name nowabandon you, remain unspoken,
unheard.

May your name be borne by no one.

May no parent bear its burden, no child its legacy.

You have wrought murderous words from letters.
When you lie in the ground, may you hear

the words of Abel’s cry

six million times

echoing from unmarked, mass graves.
May no letters combine to console you.
May this be your alphabet:

Country

~ Continued from page 7

too good for other performers or
too busy for one’s fans means swift
burial in Nashville. Image is all-
important.

It is true that most of these
people come from simple begin-
nings and are, therefore, extra-
appreciative of theirsuccesses. But
they are also gracious and thankful
to their heroes and their fans. My
point is, they’re (on the whole)
pretty down-to-earth people who
(believe it or not) are in it not so
much for the money as to have fun,
make people happy, and do what
they love.

Example: Duet albums make
less money and are certainly less
productive toward an act’s career -
hence the lack thereof in most for-
mats of music. But duet albums
abound in country music. Why?
Much of the reason stems from
artists who just want a chance to
record with some of the other
musicians whom they have grown
to love.

Does this all sound boring?
Maybe so. But I for one was re-
freshed to see Holly Dunn’s re-
sponse to the date rape contro-
versy surrounding her song “When
I Say No I Mean Maybe”. Unlike
pop acts who issue argumentative
statements, go to court, and make
themselves look like spoiled chil-
dren whoare acting under the guise
of creativity and art, Holly Dunn
asked that the song (though she
personally saw it as harmless) be
removed from the radio, lestothers
be further offended. The song was
on its way to being a big hit.

Well, I could write forever on

the virtues of country. The fact is,
Iam not some crusader who would
have all other formats of music
abolished. To the contrary, enjoy
thoroughly almost all types of
music known in America. My
point is simply that country music
has a great deal to offer to any
listener. If you still haven’ t opened
up, I sincerely hope you will give it
an honest shot. You won’t be dis-
appointed.
