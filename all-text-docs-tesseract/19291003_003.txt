SIDE LINE SHOTS

At the “Scrappiest Eleven”
in-the Country

By P. R. Alderman

Judging from current comments, opinions
and what-not, there doesn’t seem to be
much complaint on the part of Davidson
about the Wildcat-Tiger clash last Satur-
day. And why should there be? We came
out on the small end of the score because
it couldn’t be helped. A real Davidson
team with that old Wildcat spirit entered
the field Saturday against a great football
machine that had practically all odds in
their favor and gave them a battle that
won't be forgotten any time soon. No-
body could ask for more because they
gave all they had and, with the backing
of an equally enthused studenf body,

handed ‘a surprise to the ‘football’ world in
general,

It’s always very hard, almost impos-
sible, to pick out any one or two men
on a Wildcat team who outshone their
teammates in a gaze because all are
almost equally deserving of praise and
mention, But the work of Captain
Thad Brock in the line and “Red”
Parrish and Joe McCall in the back-
field against Clemson was nothing
less than spectacular. Whatever his
duties, offensive or defensive, Thad
more than once showed himself to
to be of all-state calibre. While two
fleet(footed and elusive backs, McCall
and Parrish were a constant threat to
to the Tiger’s goal. The former's 85
yard run and the 68-yard one of the
latter furnished two of the high spots

of the game as well as Davidson’s two
touchdowns.

Let’s not forget the rest of the eleven,
however, in giving due mention to these
men. Outweighed between 15 and 16
pounds to the man, they forced their
much stronger opponents to take to the
air and resort to end-runs to s¢ore 32
points. That thin Red and Black line was
tried as it will probably not be tried again
this season and it proved too sturdy for
the good of line-plunging Clemson backs.
This was well-proven when it took four
downs for the Tigers to advance a little
over two yards for their only touchdown
that was not the result directly of end-

ae and passes. They just wouldn't back
up

To much can’t be said in behalf of
the Davidson eleven, but there is quite |
a bit of credit due the Clemson squad,
especially one or two of its well.
known members, Anyone looking for
speed certainly must have enjoyed the
game greatly, because there was
plenty of it, and Johnny Justice, fleet
Tiger halfback, exhibited his share
of it. His ability to skirt around i
end almost before the rest of the men
got into action, coupled with Mc-
Millan’s deadly passing, proved the
two most disastrous factors of the day
to the Wildcats. In fact these two
events, happening so continuously, ac-
counted indirectly for all of Clemson’s
touchdowns and directly for four of

them.

There will’ be othcr games this year,
however, and no doubt Monk and Tex
will see to it that a better defense against
a passing attack is developed before many
more Saturdays come and go. This has
proved a weakness, and a very costly one,
in Wildcat teams for the past two sea-
sons, as was evidenced by the Carolina
game of last year. But Davidson jis pretty
severely handicapped by the lack of tall
men, especially on ends, and it takes men
of pretty good height to very effectively
combat a strong aerial attack. As is clear-

ly evident, though, a good defense against

Game—McMillan and Pustus Star

Before the largest crowd eyer to witness
a football game in Charlotte, the Davidson
Wildcats fought the Clemson Tigers to a
standstill through ding-
dong football, only to have a possible victory
taken from their grasp by a brilliant passing
attack. The Tigers, outweighing Davidson
almost twenty-pounds to the man, found their
weight of little advantage to them ‘against
that indomitable Wildcat fight, and it was
not until the fourth quarter that they could
run up the score on the exhausted Cats.

The game packed into its sixty-minute
diiration all the thrills the most rabid foot-
ball fan could desire. It saw an under-dog
rise to supreme heights. It was full of
sparkling defensive plays, of lightning-like
passes, of sweeping end-runs. And to cap
the climax, the game showed one of those
raritiés of football—a touchdown from the
kickoff. Late in the fourth quarter, Joe Me-
Call caught a Tiger kickoff on his own ten
yard line. Tucking the ball under his arm, he
headed up the sidelines behind perfect inter-
ference that mowed down every would-be
tackler. He left them all behind in midfield
and raced on across the goal-line untouched,
This was undoubtedly the outstanding play
of the entire contest.

It would be impossible to pick out any one
man and label him the star of this game. But
in the final analysis, it was those seven fight-
ing -Wildcats who made up that “thin red
line’ to whom most of the praise belong.
Facing what is generally conceded to be one
of the most powerful forward walls in the
South, that line refused to give against the
most determined charges of the Tigers. They
went into the game determined to do every-

such is the prime need of the team this
year, because that line holds its own
against off-tackle plays and the like.

Quite a bit of diversified opinion is
abroad concerning this year’s fresh-
man team, but generally the comments
are more favorable than otherwise.
It’s true they haven't made as good a
showing in scrimmages with the Var-
sity as could be desired but they’ve
got some good material out there and
“Red” Laird will undoubtedly make
the best of it. The results of their
clash with the Oak Ridge cadets to-
morrow will clear up a lot of ques-
tions about this year’s kittens. They’ve
got a strong opponent for the first
match but with about three and one-
‘half weeks practice ought to give the
prep-schools all the competition they
could desire.

in last Saturday’s clash with the strong Clemson Tigers proved one of the out-

standing features of the day.

Kittens Play First
Contest Tomorrow

Tomorrow afternoons “Red” Laird, fresh-
man coach, will send his Wildkittens against
Oak Ridge at Oak Ridge. This is the initial
game of (the season for the Freshmen and
the second for the cadets. They battled Har-
grave Military Academy last Saturday, de-
feating them on the Virginians’ own soil,
7-0, in a hard fought game. Oak Ridge
scored in the first five minutes of play.

I past years the prep school’s teams have
proven exceptionally strong, and since the
fresh material this year is very promising,
according to Coach Laird, the game will be
close as in the past. Oak Ridge defeated the
Wildkittens last year by the score of 18-0
and the year before 11-0.
