Y. m. C. A. LAUNCHES IMPROVED PROGRAM

From The Secretary's: Desk...

By BILL SMITH

Are you very much interested
in the “Y" and its work on the
Davidson Campus? Some are; how-
ever, many of us merely accept it
and never sincerely examine our
interest in it. There seems to be
at least four good reasons why
all of us should be vitally con.
cerned with the “VY” and its pro-
gram.

L. First, it is the channel through
which we can give expression to
our religious convictions, There are
only fifteen men in our entire stu-
dent hody who are not members of
some church. This is indicative of
some sort of conviction, One who
is genuinely convinced that God
is, desires to express his feeling in
a wholesome and profitable way.
This practical application of one’s
faith is made possible through the
varied activities of the campus “oy”
le provides us with the opportunity
of expressing that which we cher-
ish as highly as anything — our
right to the ee Faith,

Il. Second, the “Y" is designed
to broaden our te allege experience
beyond = that of purely academic
pursuit.
of a college is to prepare one for
his station in fife. The. “Y" makes
an effort to contribute its important
part to that preparation. One does
not necessarily have to be active in
“Y" work to derive his benefit.
Many phases of the total program
are designed so as to benefit those
who will give their time to re-
ceive. We see an example of this in
the Spring and Fall services. held
each year on the campus under the
sponsorship of the “Y.” If we are
interested in the program and policy
of this organization we can not
help but broaden the whole of our
college experience,

IML. Third, it helps vs to.form the
habit of giving ourselves to some-
one or something outside of our-
selves, This is admittedly a very im-
portant principle in living a whole.
some life. Most of us are inclined
to be selfish with our time, our per-
sonality, and our possessions. There
are few who will admit that this
is good, Therefore it is wise that we
seek to develop less selfish attitudes
as we prepare for our particular path
through life, We believe in this
principle so strongly that about one
hundred and fifty men are willing
to give of their time. unselfishly
to help those who need them. Then
too, every year we have neatly one
hundred per cent of our student
body that responds generously and
nobly to the annual “Y” Christ-
mas Gift Fund. More often than
not we really do for ourselves
when we do for others.

IV. Fourth, we should be con-
cerned with the “Y" program be-
cause we actually have an invest-
ment in it: It.is primarily of the
‘stadehts and for the students. The
financial obligations are met large-
ly by a part of the student activity
fee and the Sunday evening offer-
ings. The actual work it does is
done by students. With this sort: of
an investment, it seems only logical
that we should be concerned with
what the “Y” does.

'Y’ Sunday School
Conducted In Lounge

Each Sabbath morning at 10:15
a Sunday School Class is held in
the lounge of the Guest House for
all students who wish to attend.

The teachers fur these classes
have been various members of the
faculty. Each teacher has attempt-
ed to present the lesson at student
level, applying the lesson to college
life and practical situations~ Differ-
ent students each Sunday lead a
short devotional service before the
lesson is delivered.

Bob Gay, Y cabinet member, is
directly in charge of this aspect of
the Y program. He has followed the
custom of past years by having cof-
fee and doughnuts served just be-
fore the class convenes. This is for
the fellows who do not arise in
time to enjoy the morning meal.

It is well to note that the Sun-
day School Class is not limited to
any one denomination or group,
but welcomes all students desiring
to be taught the standard Sunday
School lesson from Sabbath to Sab-
bath.

iChape Programs
Show Purpose of ‘Y’

Lverybody bas a mouthpiece or
some means of communication by
which it can express itself. bt is|
this function which the Monday
morning chapel’ programeclaims for
the YMCA. ‘the function of this
chapel program is to inform the.
student body of the purposes and
projects of the V.M.C.A.

The \ plays a very definite part
in the tives of all the students at
Davidson. It is a means of unify-
ing the whole student body into a
project of Christian helpfulness for
the students ‘themselves and for
the cominunity round about the
-chool. It is therefore the duty of
the chapel progrant to show the
students some of their own needs
and the needs o1 cthers.

It is the first purpose of these
selected Mondays to show the stu-
dents that the Y.M.C.A. is. not a
group of pre-ministerial students,
but is made-up of the men of the
same substance with the same likes’
and- dislikes, all other average
Davidson ‘students have. The

Y.M.CA is for every Christian to
work in and enjoy, whether he is
planning on going into business,
medicine, or any other field. It is
therefore, simply an organized out.
let for Christian young men.

It is with this principle in mind,
that the Y cabinet. has planned this
series of chapel programs for the
year. So far there has been a va-
riety in the programs which seems
to have been enjoyed by the whole
student body.

This past Monday the ¥.M.C.A.
worked in cooperation with the
Student Council of Davidson to
heip put across the true outlook |
and cooperative function of each
student. toward his fellow-students
and his own studeni government.

The program for the rest of the
year should prove to be quite en-
tertaining for all. These are some
of the programs scheduled: the fa-
mous Johnson Family Singers; the
Davidson Male Chorus; the David-
son Concert Band; Mr. Melvin
Sipes, a great violinist with versatil
Alfred Neuman at the piano; then
it is hoped that the Johnson C.
Smith University Chorus will give
us 4 program; and a program that
showld delight all Davidson Stua-
dents, the Queen’s ‘Choral Club.

On October 15, forty young Da-
vidsonians desiring a pure impulse
from the wilds of nature made a
pilgrimage to Montreat College as
guests of their freshman class, The
transportation waé furnished by
Montreat, and after a five hour trip,
these nature lovers arrived in time
to enjoy a tantalizing meal as a
beginning of their week end. This
was the first time that. such a par-
0 had been undertaken by the Y.

1. C. A. or any other organiza-
tion on the campus: and it is our
hope that this will become tradi-
tion,

A square dance was held Satur
day night in which the music was
furnished by three of Davidson's
cultured hill-billies. We atso fur.
nished the caller, but Montreat
furnished the most important. in-
gredient — young ladies. During
intermission their sophomore class
entertained everyone with reiresh-
ments, and several girls showed
forth their practiced talents. After
the dance the couples bid goodnight
in Davidson-Montreat fashion. On
‘Sunday morning the boys escorted

Emphasis In Boy’s Work
Stressed In Years Program

The Boy’s Department of the
Y. M. C. A. plays a very active
part in the lives of the boys in the
communities of Davidson, Corne-
lius and Huntersville. When one
thinks of a Y.M.C.A. he automatic-
ally thinks of boys and recreation.
Our purpose is to take these boys,
encourage active participation in
sports and at the same time culti.
vate habits that will result in
strong character. One of the pri-
mary influences is sportsmanship.
Many boys form their ideas of
good and bad sportsmanship at
this early stage, and good leader-
ship at this time. can influénce his
thinking a great deal.

Here, the students of Davidson
come in for an active part for our
department is run entirely by the
students. Two or three times each
week, the student leaders go into
each of these cammunities and
work with the boys. The groups
range in size from about twelve or

fifteen to thirty or forty members.
They are divided into two age
groups, the first called the Gra-Y
which is made up of boys from
nine to twelve years of age. The
other group is called the Jr. Hi-Y
and is made up of boys from twelve
to fifteen years of age. With these
two age groups, this year we plan
to have at least two teams in each
community, therefore we need at
least two leaders in each place, So
far we have had a good response
from the student body, but we
could use a few more leaders. Our
present student Jeaders include Bob
Griggsby, Cecit Rhodes, Bob Pos-
ton, Charlie Mann, John Nisbet,
Charlie Hawkins and Mac Doubles.

As I stated above our purpose is
to encourage the participation in
sports and teach good sportsman-
ship. Therefore, the first thing a
leader does upon entering a com-
munity is to organize a football

the freshman class to church and
then retired for dinner.

Vorty Davidsonians returned to
campus late Sunday afternoon with
varied tales about their retreat to
Nature. It seemed that Nature was
too-much with them in the form of
two days of continuous rain, With
the blossoming forth of new ro-
Mmanees we expect several of these
boys to be going back to Montreat
in the near future.

The Y. M. C. A. sponsored an-
other. party on October Ist, when
Salem College was our guest for
an afternoon and night. One hun-
dred and ghirty girls invaded our
campus, but thé Davidson — boys
soon had the situation in hand
before they could dig in. The “D”
club gave a dance in the old ym
(*) which was brilliantly decorated
in white and red. The dance final.
ly began after several hours work
on a coy phonograph, The dance
was culminated with fifteen min-
utes of music furnished by “The
Cripple Creek Boys,” an ingenious
group that has become followers
of the famous Roy Acuff. After the

Christmas Gift Fund
Reduced In 49 Plan

For: some years now, the Y.M.
C.A. on the campus has: sponsored
large and successful gift projects
ior various worthy causes. Recall-
ing the Gifts Fund during the past
several years, the student body has
every right-te pride itself over the
remarkable success with which each
of these drives has met. None of
the pifts in recent years has been
less than five thousand dollars.
and last years drive rang an all
time high when over six thousand
dollars were contributed,

Because the “giving spirit” is
naturally at- it» strongest during
the Christmas season, the campaign
will be Jaunched again this year in
the month of December, With a
slightly reduced student body and
with the sources of giving not quite
so bountiful as previous years have
found them to be, perhaps it would
be wise to set the goal at $4500.

As we look at the Gift Fund
drives yet in our memories, we
find that our generosity has bene-
fitted probably far beyond our
imagination people in dire need of
other countries. The men who are
now Seniors gave in their fresh-
man year to the rebuilding of
Hangchow Christian College in
China; the “next year- our gift went
to the construction of a Y.M.C.A.
building in Japan; and then last
year We sent our record sum of
over six thousand dollars to the
“Casualty” students of Marburg
University in Germany. In the past
the projects have exhibited great
merit not only in the need they
were fulfilling, but also in the proc-
lamation of the message of Jesus

Christ which they embodied.

One: of the most poignant stories

pensive casket and multitudes of
ilowrrs. One of. the friends ot the

Do such facilities warrant
_ plaints;
The V cabinet readily agrees

with the student body that such an
inadequate program as this should
be corrected, It has long been Tee
alized that the VoM.C A. program
eu the campus will not be com-
plete until this embarassing sitwa-
tion has been corrdcted: Sure, you
say, its been realized, but nothing
has been done about it.

Now, jase to clie you in, some.
thing his been done about it. “The
plans concerning this problem. have
received much notice this year. Ev-
en late the middle of last
year plans were formulated on the
supposition, that the Y recreational
facilities. would moved to the
old gym when the new gym is com.
pleted. ‘Whese plans are still the
basis for hopes of the cabinet that
this problem may soon be remedied.

Af-and. when such theughts on
the program do materialize here is
what will be 6n hand for all stu-
dents who are interested. Adequate
ping pong tables, pool tables, prob-
ably badminton and shuffle board
courts will be available at all hours.
Other moré strenuous games. will
be played in the new gym.,

Ax these plans proceéd. the Stu-

thus this faithful old building will
become the real ceifter of. student
activity on the campus. With
such recreational facilities available
so near the Student Store, cer-
tainly their usefulness will be great-
ly increased.

This is not written in defense of
the Y program, its actions speak
for this; but these words are pre-
pared. to give to student and aluin-
nian idea of one of the great ob.
jectives of the YV.MLC.A. -on the

Prayer Meetings Supplement Academic
Week With Needed Spiritual Experience

As the Y. M. C. A. goes about
its task of serving the Student Body
by cultivating the spiritual life of
each student on the campus, it
finds no greater road of service
than through weekly Hall Pray.
er Meetings. The tradition of these
short devotional periods has be-
come one of the most hallowed and
useful customs handed down
through the years of the College.
Many students have been able to
point to this one service as their
chief source of spiritual develop.
ment,

The purpose of these meetings
is conceived to be to provide a spir-
itual experience for all men on the
hall; to provide a life. and an op-
portunity to deepen convictions, At
the beginning of the school year,
this department surveyed the whole
tradition of the Hall Prayer Meet-
ings and attempted to point the
work this year in the direction of
greater service to a larger number

of men. The progress thus far has
been very successful in achieving
this goal with a record making
mark of 476 boys. attending the
first night. These meetings have
already been providing a new spir-
itual opportunity.

The organizational. set up of this
division of the Y is centered around
the twenty-six Halil Leaders. These
men are responsible for the super-
vision of the weckly meetings and
are in constant touch with the Y
Cabinet. Another phase of their
work involves the encouragement
and support of daily devotions on
the part of all members of their
hall. They work hand in hand with
the six Dormitory Leaders who
have general supervision over the
work in each of the dormitories.
They are thus perhaps the closest
link between each student and the
organization of the Y. The men
selected this year to serve in this
important work were chosen with

an emphasis upon their ability to
get the support of the men on the
different halls and to lead them
through the year.

One or two uew steps have been
emphasized by these leaders and are
being generally observed through-

out the Tampus. One of. these new |

steps is the rule of limiting the
meetings to 15 minutes. It is felt
that this policy, understood by all’
students, will help increase atten.
dance and support. Emphasis is
being placed on avoiding preach-

the proverbial

ing and
mtarathons."' Sincerity,
and brevity are being

stressed.

The HaJjl Prayer Meetings are
the responsibility of every student.
They can become a source of real
spiritual development for every man
on the campus. They require the

support of us all. _
