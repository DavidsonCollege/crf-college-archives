Tough Shoes

With a great deal of challenge
aforethought we accept the well-pol-
ished reins of THE DAVIDSONIAN
handed over by outgoing editor-in-
chief Charles Dibble. Unfortunately
Editor Dibble left us no hints on com-
posing our first editorial; otherwise,
he did vacate some giant shoes which
are going to be mighty tough to fill.
One man alone cannot fill those shoes.
Only with the capable staff—from as-
sociate editors to general reporters—
that is sharing the weekly responsi-
bilities with us would we dare con-
sider the mammoth job ahead.

The foremost problem ahead, prac-
tically speaking. is getting the paper
out ‘‘on time’’. This vear’s 50 per cent
increase to six pages has combined
with other unforeseeable obstacles to
create a comolex problem that may
demand‘ several weeks to solve.

Another change to improve the
qualitv of THE DAVIDSONIAN is a
special features page which we hope
to inaugurate before the end of the
vear. Every other week one page will
be devoted to an examination of some
aspect directly or indirectly concern-
ing Davidson. Through this medium
we hope to present a fresh approach
and apvearance to the paper.

Lastly, we intend to pursue a con-
scientious editorial policy. along the
lines of individual freedom and initia-
tive which the students of this college
have entrusted to us. We have no
qualms about differences of opinions
and solicit comments from readers at
anv time.

We read with interest the remarks
of Jonathan Daniels, editor of the Ra-
leigh News and Observer, in a recent

Reconstruction

To the off-campus reader of these
pages during the past few months it
must be evident that much thought
concerning the overall value of David-
son’s fraternity system has taken
place.-And indeed it has taken place.

The proportionate amount of print-
ed space devoted to this problem has
been large, for hardly anv aspect at
Davidson so directly affects each stu-
dent as does the social life provided
by the college through the staid Greek
system.

Tuesday the faculty will receive
the report of the Committee on Fra-
ternities, Clubs and Social Life, which
has been studying the fraternity eval-
uation ‘for nearly three weeks. The
concern and effort shown by the mem-
bers of the committee during this
time is indicative of the impact that
their recommendation will have.

Hardly anyone dares to deny that
shortcomings permeate the present.

Growing Up

Granted that the Commander of
the American Legion in Tuesday’s
chape] made an asinine defense of
the North Carolina Speaker-Ban law,
nevertheless the Davidson student
body gave the Commander a reception
in chapel that was both extremely dis-
courteous and sickeningly childish.

If it were a high school audience
that howled and heckled the speaker.
such behavior at least could be under-
stood in light of the immaturity of the
students—but at. Davidson there is no
excuse for such behavior.

One of the principal arguments of
those who favor a Speaker-Ban law is
that college students are too intellec-

tually immature to give Communist |

propaganda careful consideration and
analysis. The “Harry-high-school” an-
ti¢s of the Davidson student body in
Tuesday’s chapel must have been an
effective reinforcement of this belief
in the mind of the Commander.

It is really quite remarkable that
Davidson students that prattle about
giving each man and each idea a
chance to be heard should attempt as
was done in Tuesday's chapel to si-
lenc a man’s defense of an idea by mob
heckling and ridicule. Students seem

not now and never has been any one
model of the personal journalist or
the crusading editor. Many of those of
the past would look as awkward on
marble pedestals as some do now with
prizes in their hands or framed awards
on their walls... . Not all, of course,
were virtuosos of verbal violence.

“As much of the impression of the
press on American history has been
made with sugar as with vinegar... .

“There will always be crusading
newspapers and editors. The weakest
and strongest papers and editors are
inescapably crusaders. Mediocrity gets
its message across. Timidity can be
taught, and in too many towns it is
being taught... .

“But, actually few things change
in the character of the American
press ... There will always be Wash-

and Jeffersons who hold to their faith
in freedom despite freedom’s faults.
And there will also always be editors
incapable of flame and force in the
use of freedom.

“But—and it is the great and pre-

word-armed and word-ready, in the
tradition of the crusading editors of
the past. Impertinent often, pugna-

uncaptured by conformity, they will
be at the barricade of America bat-

be lost when their spirit is gone.”

social structure at Davidson. As dis-
cussed in this column in previous
weeks these inadequacies must be cor-
rected.

No other proposed solution meets,
the problem so squarely as does the
majority report of the Fraternity Eval-
uation Committee. Such a statement
does not come easily, for we disap-
prove of change merely for the sake
of change; but we cringe even more
at the blindness of some members of
the college community to the crum-
bling pillars on which the fraternity
system now rests.

No amount of watered-down mor-
tar is going to correct our social struc-
ture now. We hope that the faculty
will realize that a half-way solution
will only create as ‘many problems as
it can possibly solve. This repair job
will require mortar with real sub-
stance.

to give only lip service to the concept
of intellectual fair play — that each
idea should be met with rational argu-
ment and at least courteous consider-
ation.

Perhaps it is unfair to. lay the
blame on the entire student body for
the blatantly rude treatment given to
the Commander. Perhaps only a small
minority of students were responsible.
But for whoever was responsible, this
remains: Intellectual maturity does
not consist in using ridicule against
unpopular ideas. Intellectual maturity
does not consist of using laughter to
silence an idea. Only very immature
individuals hide in the anonymity of
a crowd and attack a man and his
ideas through howling and hissing and
jeering. |

A certain professor was reported
to have told his class that he was
-proud of the studen‘ behavior in that

chapel. It is a sad commentary on the-

maturity of some professors that they
are willling to give courteous atten-
tion only to certain ideas.

'f anyone should be concerned
with the freedom to speak and to be
heard and the free rational dissemi-
nation of ideas, it should be the col-
lege professor. But apparently at least
this one man forgot about his com-
mitment to academic responsibilitv—
this one man apparently forgot that
this principle of intellectual fair play
was the safeguard for dissemination
of his own ideas.

We agree that the Commander's
presentation violated many principles
of English grammar, logic and com-
mon sense. We privatelv feel that
many of his ideas were ridiculous, but
this man and his ideas deserved a
chance to be heard and polite treat-
ment during this presentation—and
the Commander was not given this
chance.

Intellectual maturity requires that
each idea be given a fair and careful
consideration — intellectual maturity
does not react to disagreeable ideas
by heckling and ridicule from the
safety of a crowd. There are a good
many Davidson students and at least
one Davidson professor that still have
much intellectual growing-up to do.

Archaic Davidson College:
Safe Place To Send A Boy

Now that Spring has returned, it’s time for the

revival of that archaic pursuit—criticism of David-
Nege.

twelve imperiled little houses, derrieres bedecked

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Lakey's ‘Inspiring V Words
Cause Sophomore To Gag

Dear Edor:

With the inspiring words of
Leroy Lakey still ringing in my
ears I pauze to make one brief
comment on the fascinating
material pzesented to us by
the second of Tuesday’s chap-
el speakers.

Laws prohibiting libel and
slander require that I mask my
full impression of this excei-
lent. and I presume typical.
representative of the  pro-
Speaker Ban Law faction.

Wa.le not a member of any
committee or group seeking to
have the law repealed and as
an out-of-stater who has not
given the law detailed atten-
tion (apart from an occasional
snicker of amazement that any
legislature could pass a law
condemning a man simply for
utilizing such constitutional
privileges as taking the Fifth
Amendment), still as an_ indi-
vidual with at least a shred. of
intelligence I found it impos-
sible not to guffaw loudly at
some of Lakey's statements on
Tuesday.

The essential point I wish to
question is his desire to shield
our impressionable young
minds from danger. While Mr.

- Lakey does not feel that college

verted by certein lecturers
on certain top:cs — hence the
need fo: the Speaker Ban Law.

Yet Lakey blew this whole
thesis at the close of his speech
by reading ‘us that subversive
communi.t autnored poem en-
titled ‘Goodbye, Christ.” As
he stated, the purpose for read-
ing it was to demonstrate to
us the dangers of having com-
munist material presented to
students. Yet by reading it he

takes for granted that we, al-
though students ourselves, in

reality are discriminating
enough, are intelligent enough
to distinguish the dangers of
communism without the help of
the North Carolina Legislature.
But if this is the case and of
course it is, then why the need
to gag communist speakers?

Only through the exercise of
our heritage of freedom can de-
mocracy prove superior to to-
talitarianism. The real adn-
ger comes when state legisla-
tures introduce such methods
of thought control as those sup-
ported by Mr. Lakey. No mat-
ter how well intended, the gag
Jaw stinks.

Dear Editor:

It would be foolish to sug-
pose that the mucn maligned
Tuesday chapel speaker was of

the caliber of his opponent. but

regardless of the quality or de-

livery of his side of the {issue
we, the studen‘s, owed him our
respect. The decency witihn us
should demand a more cour-
teous reception.

I plead no innocence in. this
aberration, and appeal primar-
ily to those who engage in
such abuse as was leveled at
our speaker. ‘Let us act in a
manner more becoming of our

image as gentlemen.

Dear Editor:

best college in the South and one of the best in the
nation. Come to the school that only in recent years
has erased ‘a safe place to send your boy from its

financia) documents.”

Today, Davidson College
survives on its reputation.
The institution has retreated
from the front lines of edu-
cational progress, if, indeed,
it ever joined those ranks. De-
ception is the weapon David-
gon uses—unabashed decep-
tion of the national education-
al community and self-decep-
tion. Tne college is, at pres-
ent, undeniably distant from
that number of institutions
counted as “the best.”

While , educational theory
and practice are in the throes
of tumultuous innovation,
Davidson lies satisfied, lan-
guishing in its isolation. It
prefers to remain static amid
the din of educational accel-
eration. Rather than looking
optimistically io a promising
future, Davidson continues to
Strengthen its ties with the
past.

‘BOARD OF TRUSTEES
The most unsurmountable

stumbling block impeding Da-
vidson’s path is the jaded.
conservative ‘Board. of Trus-
tees, who, upon their return
to the campus, want to see
it “just as it was when I
was here.” Are these gentle-
men of the Board truly blirid
to the erupting influences af-
fecting modern education's re-
quirements and goals? Their
dogged retention of David-
son's fabled faculty oath sup-
plies the answer to that ques-
tion.

Within the college itself
there are a multitude of glar-
ing weaknesses.

Visiting scholars are con-
tinually- astounded that there
exists in the twentieth cen-
tury a college of Davidson's
reputed stature still ordering

In America

The Fifteenth Amendment to the
Constitution is a short one. It reads:

“1. The right of citizens of the
United States to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by the United
States or by any State on account
of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude.

“2. The Congress shall have pow-
er to enforce this article by appro-
priate legislation.”

The Voting Rights Act of 1965, now
before Congress, indeed aims at pre-
venting racial discrimination in voter
registration, and we endorse this aim.
However, this bill goes far beyand
providing means to prevent violation
of the Fifteenth Amendment, to the
extent of almost making a mockery of
the Constitution it purports‘ to pre-
serve.

The iirst article of the Constitu-
tion gives to the states the authoriiy
to decide the qualifications of voters,
and this authority was reaffirmed in
the Seventeenth Amendment, adopted
in 1913. Yet the proposed legislation
gives the: national government the
power to abolish this authority, under
the guise of power granted by the Fif-
teenth Amendment, which through no
Stretch of the imagination gives the
national government such a power.

This paradox does not stand alone
in the bill. A glaring absurdity in a
bill whose purpose is the prevention
of discrimination is the statistical re-
quirement for application of the law.
Enforcement will only result in those
States in which less than 50 per cent
of the voting age population voted in
the last election (excluding fifteen
states with literacy tests, such as New
York, where such tests prevent hun-
dreds of thousands of Negroes and
Puerto Ricans from voting because of
illiteracy in the English language),
and in those states which have literacy
_tests (excluding states such ys Texas,
where only 44 per cent of the voting
age population voted in 1964).

Only six states fall into both of
these categories and only in these six
States will the national government,

under the “authority” of the Voting
Rights Act, be impowered to abolish
all tests of citizens’ ability to read and
write our language as a qualification
for voting. Thus the glaring possibility
arises of a moron being given by fed-
eral agents the right to vote in Ala-
yania. but denied this “right” in New
ork.

This irony, says the Wall Street
Journal, ‘is not funny. Beneath the
paradox lies a serious question. Is it
moral that national laws should apply
one rule to one State and another to
another, requiring that the people of
one State abolish qualifications for
voters while the people of another
State may uphold their standards?”

The paradoxses of the bill reach
the absurd where the Act provides
that these six states are guilty of dis-
crimination unless they can prove
themselves innocent, directly contra-
dicting the American system of law,
by which a person is innocent until
proven guilty. Further, the states have
to prove that no discrimination against
any individual has existed in the last
ten years, an impossibility even in
New York City, Chicago, or Johnson
City, Tex.

The equal rights fight could be pur-
sued and the Fifteenth Amendment
enforced with a bill requiring every
citizen to renew his registration and
providing for federal inspection to in-
sure that every individual is given
equal opportunity to register, regard-
less of race and subject to the same
impartial literacy requirements.

But the present Voting Rights Bill
proposes to abolish certain constitu-
tional rights of six states and substi-
tute federal executive decree. As one
Senator recently noted. “If this can
be done for this Administration, for
the purposes of this bill, to punish
the States it has chosen, it can be done
at other times for other purposes to
destroy the constitutional rights of
others, the Constitution notwithstand-
ing.”

But surely it couldn’t happen in
America.

It seems to be a time on tutions. There is an institution cal consideration as the fra-
the Davidson campus for criti- on the Davidson campus which ternity system:

this is the

ROTC department.

I do not object to the ROTC
program as such; in fact, I
think that it is a great oppor-
tunity for those students who
wish 0 pursue advanced
ROTC,

What I do bitterly object to
is tae fact taat all stuedntls,
regardless of their plans con-
cerning advanced ROTC, are
required to enter the program
for two years.

Seeing that the ROTC depart
ment can be maintaincd on the
Davidson campus only it at
least one hundred students sign
up for the program aurng
their freshman year, it 15 not
true that those students who
are not planning to enter the
advanced program are being
“sacrificed"’ to this same pro-
gram? Is it not true that those
students are required to under-
go the program for two years
merely for the sake of preserv-
ing the advanced program?

Perhaps the college receives
some financial benefit from the
government for everyone en-
rolled in the ROTC program. If
this be the caze, this is even
a more deplorable reason than
the f.rst one that I ment:oned.
In either case those students
who do not plan to enter the
advanced program are being
used by the college.

if the fraternity system, a
system which adversely affects
vnly one-fourth of ‘the student
body, is to be criticized so
tnoroughly, I feel that che
ROTC department, which at-
fects the entire college, should
at least receive a little con-
sideration.

tradition is not to be entirely
castigated, but required wor-

link {o the Puritan past.

The alleged flies, flits, what-
ever you shall call them, en-
rolled at Davidson are a crit-
icism laid at the doormat of
the Admiiszions Committee.
The weakness of that office
rests, however, not ‘with iis
acceptance of that band, but
with its insistence upon ac-
cepting virtualis no one who
does not fit into the worn
mold of the proverbial Da-
vidson gentleman. There is
no Bohemian element on this
campus, no group of crusad-
ers, no one who cannot re-
main satisfied within ‘the
mold. Admissions procedures
insure exclusion of any
‘risks’ which might damage
the image. The Admissions
Committee will not indulge
itself to look beyond those ris-
ing SAT scores, that ever-
swelling academic average.
It has, of its own volition,
trapped itself in a tradition
which demands annual in-
creases in those verbal and
mathematical numbers. Where
is that purportedly ‘“well-
rounded” student body? It is
not at Davidson College.

CURRICULUM

Foundations of the college
are multi-fold, but the ulti-
mate criteria for scholarship
resides in the college cur-
riculum. Under one bridge
reaching from teacher to stu-
dent rests the ogre of Da-
vidson’s academic inferiority.
in the area -where an out-
standing college should excel,
this college fails.

Wnere_ are Davidson's
courses in geology, in as-
tronomy, in Oriental langu- .
ages, in non-survey contem-
porary literature? They do
not exist. Further, vast num-
bers of courses are offered
only in alternating years.

Even _ excusing failure
through omission (which is, in
a highly-rated college, inex-
cusable), the existing cur-
blight. While dying trees are
sheared in front of the Cham-
bermaids, behind those para-
gons of virginity the student
of sociology or Latin must
pursue his major in a de-
partment statfea by only one
prolessor. li he desires study
in Greek, Spanish, or politi-
cal science, he must be sat-
isfied with only two profes-
sors.

In order 10 alleviate. the
“‘missing courses problein,”’
why hasn't the college offer-
ed a reading program oxercis
ed under the supervision of a
qualified professor, to gap the
void left by course omission?
The student could’ study an a

mester hour credit. The so-’

There is not justification
with which Davidson College

Stagnant waters of this insti-
tution are growing mossy and
