cussion leaders, and young people's
workers. As such, they also serve,
secondarily, to develop the stu-
dent through experience in leader-
ship, speaking, and social work.
Deputations

The deputation activities are
centered around young people’s
groups in surrounding churches
and schools. So far, around twenty-
five deputations have been made
to such institutions of learning
as Queens, W.C., Winthrop and
Wofford, and to churches located
al] over the Carolinas.

A deputations team, usually con-
sisting of four students, meets well
in advance of the proposed trip,
discusses the program with chair-
man Scholl, and then returns
again for a briefer prior to de-
parture. Traveling in the Y car,
the team hold their services
throughout the week in SCA’s or
some denominational group con-
sisting of high school and college
age young people. Of the near
forty who signed up, some twenty-
five have participated in these
deputations, coming from all four
classes and all varied interests
and intended occupations.

The overall aim of the comrit-
tee has been to attempt to conduct
discussions that will raise eye-
opening and thought-provoking
questions in the minds of the
audiences, rather than to lecture.

Due to frequent requests, the
committee is planning a religious
emphasis in May at Elkin High
School. A different DC student
each morning will lead the chapel
exercises centering around the
general topic, “The Maturing of
Christian Young People.”

There has been a constant de-
mand throughout the year from the
churches and schools for these
deputations. All requests have been
fulfilled and several more are
scheduled for completion in April

Davidson Chorus
Praised by Observer

(Ed note: The following re-
view of Wednesday night’s
Male Chorus concert is re-
printed from the Charlotte
Observer.)

By WRISTON LOCKLAIR

Observer Staff Writer

Although the very competent
Dartmouth College and Princeton
University Glee Clubs have been
interesting and entertaining in re-
cent programs here, they are not
as accomplished in the art of sing-
ing as a group of 30 young men
right in the neighborhood—the
Davidson College Male Chorus.

The visitors from the Ivy
League, who drew large and ap-
proving audiences, sang every-
thing from Handel to Gershwin,
and sang with spirit. They were
delightful in popular tunes and
college songs. But the Davidson
chorus is more interested in the
production of music for music’s
gake. It is thoroughly serious. And
the product of this attitude is a
timbre and a finesse that must
have been the envy of many larger
colleges and universities visited on
the recent chorus tour in the
North.

Quality High

Usually, there are about 90 can-
didates for the chorus, with about
30 boys from all four classes ac-
cepted in the fall. Rehearsals are
about three times a week. There
is no better example of good quali-
ty in relation to small quantity.

The early sacred music, which

occupied the first portion of the
concert was sung in Latin and was
beautifully projected. (There is ex-
ceptionally fine resonance in the
bass voices, giving the ensemble
a solid foundation.)
' The four Schubert songs were
the most stimulating section of
the diverse program. “La Pastorel-
la” has never sounded more melo-
dious, and the “Widerspruch” was
admirably unfolded.

Randall Thompson’s Taran-
tella” is a somber and striking
composition, set to a text by the
eccentric Hilaire Bellotk. The color
and contrasts in the vocal line are
numerous and the harmonies are
dramatic. With Robert Crutchfield
singing the tenor verses, there was
a haunting quality to the familiar
€Poor Wayfaring Stranger.” (Ear-
lier, tenor Leighton McCutchen was
recalled for a seeond bow follow-
ing his solo by Gluck, “O Del Mio

Dolce Ardor.”

Sunday School Extension

The Sunday School Extension
Committee is very similar to the
former committee, being identical
in purpose, type of activity and
personnel, and in continual com-
petition for the Y car. The Sun-
day School Extension Committee
centers its efforts on Sabbath
teaching in local rural churches
and the sanatorium, with an at-
tempt to expand the work done
among the churches. The churches
served are located at Bethel,
Ramah, Mt. Mourne and Gilead,
with student teachers alternating
every other Sunday.

The most hopeful step toward
progress is the work which ts
going forth  suecessfully in
Sharrar Town under the direction
of Jim Daughdrill and Blake
Brinkerhoff. A class for small chil-
dren has been organized and meets
every Sunday afternoon in a local
home. The adults have become
slightly interested and plans are
under consideration to use a few
appropriate films to arouse further
interest among them. It is hoped
that these groups will continue to
expand in the future.

Among other plans of the com-
mittee is the purchasing and dis-
tributing of New Testaments
among the Negro group at the
sanatorium.

One of the major problems facing
both committees is how to utilize
the large number of men signed
up for this type of Y work. Most
of those unable to go on deputa-
tions or teach have aided in the
overall planning of the various

the proposals and to set a date,
probably next week, for formal pre-
sentation to the student body.

The Student Council must review
the amendments and air their
views before presentation to the
students. The delay has been at-
tributed to the fact that council
members have been busy making
up time spent in last week’s hear-
ings.

Amendment originators also have
been forced to ease their push
somewhat by last week's loss of
time in composing sessions.

According to the Constitution,
the Student Council must present
the proposed amendment exactly
as petitioned. Following the pre-
sentation the amendments will be
tabled at least ten days.

Realizing the development of
some misunderstanding over in-
dividual amendments, petitioners
agree that a great deal more ex-
planation, particularly in the mo-
tives and background of respective
proposals, is needed. They are par-
ticularly anxious to receive any
questions that may have arisen
among students.

Plaris are being made for open
discussions and printing of views
by the originators.

Sunday night’s discussion in the
YMCA lounge following vespers
gave an indication of the deep and
widespread interest held by stu-
dents. Participants exchanged
several views, pro and con, and
clarified a number of points in the
proposed amendments.

Robert Crutchifeld, who brought
the signed petition before the stu-
dent body in assembly, feels that
“the student body as a whole is
rather enthusiastic for something
to be done about the existing sit-
uation. The student. body is ready
for the change these amendments
will produce.”

College Male Chorus sings. All
attention is to the best presenta-
tion of a song. They are not
theatrical. They do not win you
by hamming all over the stage.
They win you by their seriousness
and by their musicianship.

All of this, of course, reflects
on the direction they are getting
from Donald Plott. He, too, uses
a minimum of gestures. His ap-
proach is straightforward. His
musical acumen is advanced and
he apparently knows many of the
choral pitfalls. Mr. Plott is an im-
portant talent in front of a group

WILL TERRY

Will Terry, prophetic senior
from the tobacco field of Dur-
ham, N.C., is silently serving
as cheirman of the Sunday
School extension committee
of the Y. Calling on his many
years of good attendance in
Sunday School and his crea-
tive ability, he has greatiy ex-
panded the formerly small ex-
tensions committee. He is 2
history major with e future
set in the ministry.

serving as assistant editor of
Quips and Cranks and on the

chief commencement marshal,

erary Soicety, and an officer

year elected to Who's Who.

As the old saying goes, you
can’t work both sides of the
street—not and claim to be
acting justly.

The second argument stated
above—that an accused should be
required to testify aganist himself
since attendance here is a privil-
ege enjoyed at the sufferance of
the college—is one which cannot
be successfully refuted by logic
and reason, because it proceeds on
other bases. It should be enough
to say this: The college, being a pri-
vate institution, can certainly do
what it wants to, in the manner it
deems desirable, in any matter
concerning its affairs as long as it
does not violate the law. This fact,
however, does not mean that any-
thing the college does is neces-
sarily just or fair or right. It
means merely that the college has
the force to back up its rulings;
no more and no less.

the Faculty, such general
matters of discipline as it may
desire to transfer, provided
that any action of the Student
Council involving discipline
shall be reported at once to
the Dean of Students. Any stu-
dent has the right of appeal
from the Student Council to
the Faculty, but all appeals
shall be made direct to the
Faculty.

Thus the Crutchfield amendment
offers to students no right of ap-
peal, which is fundamental in any
law structure, and further it is
actually incompatible with the
views of any of the other groups
vitally concerned with the further-
ing and advancement of student
government.

By the simplest analysis you can
see that what is proposed here
consitutes a power which we stu-
dents just do not possess.

The Answer

The proposed amendments to
the Student Government Constitu-
tion as they now stand are ambi-'
gous, ill-conceived, unrepresenta-
tive, illegal, solve no problems but
only create many more difficult
and complex ones, and finally rep-
resent immature thinking.

There is only one of the amend-
ments with which I partially agree
and that is the drinking rule. In
the past the penalty has been en-
tirely too severe and so inter-
preted that few offenders came
under the rule and those that hap-
pened to get caught were martyred
as an example to others.

It would seem that the cam-
pussing business and the pledge
are too juvenile for college stu-

dents, but there certainly ought
to be some way of treating first
offenders with greater mercy than
has been shown in the past.
What is sow needed—and badiy—
is a thorough overall investigation
of the Honor System as it now
is conceived. Through the demo-
cratic processes of committee in-
vestigation, analysis, and recom-
mendation a_ solution can be
found.

The Crutchfield amendments are

solutions of sorts. We need solu. °

tions of equity and right.
