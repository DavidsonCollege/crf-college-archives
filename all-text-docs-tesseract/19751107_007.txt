In every composition, something

for anyone to tackle. This difficulty is
confounded in drama by yet another
problem: successfully doing justice to
aman and a time of such complexity
in two-and-a-half hours.

This, I think, is perhaps an
insurmountable problem of all histor-
ical drama. The tendency is, more-
over, to reduce the hero of historical
drama either to demonic or messianic
proportions.

‘‘Wilson”’ tries to tie the diffuse
period of time together by linking
scene by scene with aid of audio-vis-

“ual effects. In the play, however,

these effects have the reverse effect:
the time element becomes confused
rather than clarified.

-Poor in quality, the newsreels,
tapes and slides muddle, instead of
enlighten, the audience.

‘Man and Frog’: Menard uses drab skin colors to
contrast with frog:

Although in substance accurate,
‘“‘Wilson”’ does contain some needless
historical falsities. The Prologue has
House returning from a European
peace mission in March, 1917, that
never took place; Lodge is depicted as
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee in 1917, when,
in reality, he assumed that post in
1919.

“Wilson,” it must be emphasized,
is still a play in embryonic form. The
play, for example, was cut from a
length of four hours to two-and-a-
half. Those who see ‘“‘Wilson’’ next
weekend will witness further adapta-
tion, particularly in sequence of Act
nD,

“Wilson,” despite its shortcom-
ings, does accomplish its primary
purpose— giving dramatic life to a
moot historical figure.

Lisa Mackie is equally as colorful in
her work.In her compositions, naked
women are associating with nature in
swarms of vestel color straight form

is happening, and although that
something may be very queer, it is
at the very least unambiguous action.

David Becker teaches art at Wayne
State University in Detroit. He em-
ploys the itaglio print, making his
work appear ‘ike it is just fresh from
illustrating .an old book. The subjects
for Becker’s compositions are little,
misshapen people. They seem to be on
a picnic. The stumpy bodies are
either standing around dumbly or off
in the woods removing their clothes

in childish shame.

Helmut Schmitt, whose parents
were missionaries, presents a series of
pencil drawings showing women
sqeezing their breasts, oblivious to
whatever is going on around them.
The effect is that the subjects seem
insane or distracted. One might feel
that these women were under some

¢ work is the background he gives his

compositions. He employs zig-zag
patterns which both distract from and
incorporate the human subjects in his
work. With this insanity as a back-

drop, Schmitt’s women stare blandly .

and contort their bosoms.

Lloyd Menard has had 75 shows
since 1964. His word in ‘‘Strange
Sensibilities’’ involves man in the

peculiar situation of being in bodily
contact with animals.

Awoman is ina sleeping bag with a
giant beetle between her breasts. A
man is kissing a giant pet frog.

Menard’s use of color is drab with
regards to the human flesh. The color
in his compositions comes from the
animals he uses, the creatures in the
compositions are the instruments of
visual excitement.

Kleenex tissue.

Mackie is adept at using color and
background to create a feeling of
depth in her compositions. Light
fades toward. darkness, and images
become blurred from Mackie’s fore-
grounds to her backgrounds.

The pastels tend to make Mackie’s
people seem vulnerable and soft.
Because of this softness, Mackie’s
subjects achieve an other worldliness
and intensity as they regard the
nature that surrounds them.

The women are not merely
‘living within nature; they seem
to be co-habitating with it. Her stock
in trade is the justaposition of
situations, similar to Menard’s. She
suggests that these situations show
her feelings. What a feeling it must be
to come home to a goat!
