ITH THE
ILDCATS

By JIM LOWRY

The second half of the summer softball season ended
officially today as most of the teams quit by popular con-
against the ASTRP cadets and came out on top by the
sent. The Sigmas, paced again by the
pitching of Dill Mediord, won the second
half by a full game over the KA PikKap
Pika team which finished wwo tuli games
ahead of the etas. The Sigmas still had
ta play the Betas and the runnerup Greek

team, but it was with the sincere wish -of-
everybody that play desisted.

l.asi Friday night the embronic 1945
Cat basketball team made its first start
overwhelmingly scant margin of 29-27. The Cadets paced
by an all state guard Biando ran away to an early lead but
the Cats on baskets by Hicks and J.owry ran up a two
point lead at the half 17-15, and kept it during the remain
er of the fracas. The Cat starting team of Owens, Bry-
ant, Hicks, Edwards and Lowry, worked fairly welt for
their first game together and showed promise of becoming
an average wartime squad next year. With over fifty
treshmen coming in this fall and with the necleus of this
summers team the Cats could turn out a teani that will
live up to the Battling Bantams of last year who were one
of the better civilian teams in the South. They play the
Cadets again next Tuesday and would appreciate a turn-
out of most of the student body, and all the freshmen.

Since the last time The Davidsonian went to press.
it has detinitely been ascertained that there will be a foot-
ball team this fall. It will be classed as a Davidson fresh-
man team and will play only prep schools and high schools
There is enough material around here to turn out a fairly
good freshman tea which should give a lot of pre
‘schools ats.

Plans for the post war gym are coming along very!
nicely. Lverything that has to do with athleues ts insidc
of it. There is no doubt about the fact that when it ts built
that it will be one of the best in the South if not im the
whole country, Erom the blueprints of it it will put even:
Carolina’s Woolen Gym in the shade. Surely it is much
better than Duke's or State's ofd cracker box. After the
war when the gym is built it will be hard to keep boys
away from here after they have seen it and the records}
that future Cat basketball teams should and will hang up.
The war has undoubtedly hit Davidson harder than any
school around here. When the boys started leaving school
it was just the beginning of what might easily be called
the golden age ot Davidson athietics. Surely last year
and this year we would have had one of the better foot-
batl teams and one of the best basketball teams and one of |
the best track teams in the South and even the famous of
maybe infamous Davidson clowns might have won some
baseball games. However, after the war things will pick
up again and old boys will be back and new ones coming
in and we who have had the fortune or perhaps it will be |
our misfortune to finish our education in the midst of this
war will look back with a sort of envey on the school that
we knew of with a student body of two hundred and fifty.
While I hardly think anybody who has ever been to Da-|

ever forgotten what it stands for. There will at the same
time along with the pride that we will have for it have a:
sort of envey for the boys up here after the war. David-
son has always been tops in academic work but after the
war She will undoubtedly earn for herself a place in the
athletic world for something more than her moral vic-
tories and for her fighting spirit.
