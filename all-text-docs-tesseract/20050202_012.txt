WILSON’S PICKS
OF THE WEEK

‘Wildcat Game of
the Week

Women’s Basketball
Davidson vs. East Tennessee State
Monday, 7:00, Belk Arena

The success of the men’s basketball
team in conference play has overshad-
owed the fact that the women are playing
some outstanding basketball as well. They
have won six of their last seven games and
are 10-4 in the Southern Conference. It
seems as though every player has settled
into a contributing role, and the ’Cats can
win in a variety of ways; they can play up-
and-down basketball or slow it down with
a more defensive game. Tia Washington
07 has been an especially pleasant sur-
prise by ee — point eee posi-

SPORTS

The NFL is the best pro-
fessional league in America,
bar-none. There is extreme
parity, each game has signif- ©
icance, and the product on
the field is the best in profes-
sional sports. I plan my
weekends around Sunday
afternoons, when I plant
down on the futon to take in
all of the day’s games.

But for me, the season
might as well end once the
conference championship
games come to a close.

I admit that last year, when my Carolina
Panthers advanced all the way to Super Bowl
XXXVIII, I enjoyed every minute of it. I
watched “NFL Live” and “SportsCenter”
analysis each day leading up to the game
until I had memorized every Sean Salisbury
word. I read newspapers, magazines, and
anything else I could get my hands on, tak-
ing in all the good things the media had to
say about my Panthers.

After waiting so long for the Panthers get
any kind of national publicity, those two
weeks between the NFC Championship and
the Super Bow! were almost better than the
game itself. Fortunately, the game proved
worthy of such a build-up, despite a heart-
breaking field goal by Adam Vinatieri.

Now that I am once again an apathetic
bystander to the Super Bowl, however, I
again see that the game falls so far short of
the World Series, the NBA Finals or March
Madness. Heck, even the BCS is better than
this.

In what other sport does the championship
game have so little to do with what actually
takes place on the field?

For example, despite being one of the best

if Elon can win,

Note: home team in CAPS.

APP. STATE over The Citadel

Appalachian State will be rested for this
Thursday’s game against The Citadel after a
30-point pounding of Longwood to start the
week. After Monday night’s loss to Wofford,
Citadel coach Paul Davis said, ‘““We looked
like a very tired basketball team tonight.”
Look for the Mountaineers to jump to an
early lead and never let go against the
Bulldogs.

Wilson: App. State; Drew: App. State

CHARLESTON over Western

The College of Charleston has not lost a
home conference game all season, while
Western Carolina has yet to win a road con-
ference game all season. I don’t expect any-
thing to change on Thursday night when the
Catamounts visit the Cougars.

Wilson: Charleston; Drew: Charleston

Saturday, Feb. 5

CHATTANOOGA over Elon

Congratulations to Elon for its first confer-
ence win of the year. Can the Phoenix get its
first winning streak of the year against
Chattanooga on Saturday? Sorry Elon fans,
but the answer is no.

Wilson: Chattanooga; Drew: Chattanooga

GEORGIA SOUTHERN over Furman

Something’s got to give in this game, as
Furman comes into Statesboro as one of the
most proficient three-point shooting teams in
the country. The Paladins convert on nearly
43 percent of their shots from behind the arc,
while Georgia Southern keeps opponents
shooting at just a .343 clip from outside.
Whichever team wins the battle from outside
will come out on top.

Wilson: GSU; Drew: Furman

rom the Sideline

Super Bowl games in the
league’s _history, the
Patriots’ 31-28 victory last
year will forever be over-
shadowed by “the boob.”
When ESPN.com ranked
the top 100 moments of
Super Bowl history,
Vinatieri’s game-winning
kick was No. 10. Janet
Jackson came in eighth.

That is emblematic of a
game that has everything to
do with entertainment value
and “almost nothing to do
with who actually wins.

To many, and in fact probably most, the
Bud Bowl, the Maxim party, the commer-
cials or the half-time entertainment is far
more important than anything that could ever
happen on the field.

People go to the Super Bowl not to see a
game, but to be around the glamour of Super
Bowl week and perhaps sneak a glance at
some B-list celebrity. The fans, meanwhile,
are relegated to their couches or favorite bar
to watch the biggest game of the season.

The actual game feels like far more of a
stuffy corporate production than anything
related to football.

But in the end, while the media circus is a
big reason that my enjoyment of the Super
Bowl has again gone to nil, I really dislike
the last Sunday of the NFL season because it
is almost inevitably a let-down of Ryan Leaf
proportions.

With two weeks to kill between the con-
ference championships and Super Bowl
Sunday, every possible match-up is picked
apart until I feel like I could personally craft
a game-plan for victory.

“Sure, just spread the Eagles four-wide

WOFFORD over East
Tennessee State

East Tennessee State
will be plenty rested for
this conference battle after
its game last Saturday
against Appalachian State
was cancelled. Still, I
expect Wofford to build
off its last win at The
Citadel and defeat the
Buccaneers at home.

Davidson over UNC-G

Elon won its first game last week. Does
this mean Davidson will lose its first game
this week? Not when the Wildcats are play-
ing such solid basketball.

Wilson: Davidson; Drew: Davidson

Monday, Feb. 7

Charleston over CHATTANOOGA

Charleston will take its recent home suc-
cess on the road Monday and come out on
top against Chattanooga for the Cougars’
first conference road victory of the year.
Hey, if Elon can win a conference game, I
guess anything can happen.

‘Wilson: Chattanooga; Drew: Chattanooga

Davidson over WOFFORD

As the conference season progresses,
every team will be trying to hand the ’Cats
their first conference defeat. Still, Wofford

just doesn’t have the fire-power to take down |

Davidson and its SoCon player of the week,
Brendan Winters ’06.

East Tennessee State over ELON
Someone needs to tell Elon that coming in
last place doesn’t guarantee them the number

and then hit them up the middle with Corey
Dillon. Don’t forget to keep them honest by
going deep, though. You can still attack their
secondary if you give Tom Brady time in the
pocket.” J

Just_give me a‘head-set and a sweatshirt
and I could be Bill Belichick too.

Once that bone is picked dry, every story-
line is hashed and re-hashed ad nauseam
until the opening kick-off.

Over the past week-and-a-half, I can’t tell
you how many times I have heard the ques-
tion, “Will T.O. play?” I have heard he’s a
distraction, and an inspiration, and a decoy
in the same breath.

I have learned that Owens’ doctor won’t
let him play, the Eagles might, and God cer-
tainly will. Owens literally said, “The pain is
minimal. God has already cleared me. I have
the best doctor of all, and he cleared me.”

That doesn’t even mention the story-lines
about the Patriots’ dynasty, the Vinatieri
aura, Richard Seymour’s potential return and
Donovan McNabb’s first Super Bowl, all of
which have surfaced over the past two
weeks.

In the end, that hype is too much for one
game to handle.

For every Super Bowl XXX VIII, there are
a handful of Tampa Bay-Oakland match-ups
waiting to take its place. The average margin
of victory in Super Bowl history is 14 points,
meaning the only drama usually remaining
in the fourth quarter is who will be named
MVP.

Unfortunately, with Tom Brady behind
center again this year, that award probably
won’t be in question by the fourth quarter
either.

But hey, at least there will still be commer-
cials, and I hear the Lingirie Bowl on Pay-
Per-View is supposed to be pretty solid,

one pick in the draft.

Furman over THE
CITADEL

After watching The Citadel
play Davidson, I couldn’t
even begin to tell you who
their best player was. I even
had a friend fall asleep (more
like pass out) in the stands
44. while I watched the game. In
] on ii) the short time it has taken me

_ to make my pick, I have
decided The Citadel has now passed Elon as
my least favorite team in the league.

Wilson: Furman; Drew: Furman

App. over WESTERN

I have managed to pick five road victories
for Monday alone. The Charleston game was
a reach, and I have no clue about this one,
but if all of these predictions come true I’ll
be living the high life when I write my arti-
cle next week.

Wilson: App. State; Drew: Western

Tuesday, Feb. 8

UNC-G over Georgia Southern

I can’t possibly pick six road teams to win
in a row, so the madness must stop some-
where. UNC-G will thump Georgia Southern
after losing two SoCon battles in a row.

Wilson: Georgia Southern; Drew: Georgia
