Holocaust Survivor
Speaks About Experiences

By Russ Tisinger

On Thursday, April 4 in the
Morrison Room, Irving Mond, a
survivor of the Holocaust, spoke to
Davidson students about his expe-
riences during World War II. ~

Mond miraculously avoided
the Germans for the duration of the
war. During these years he moved
with his family around Belgium
and France, never staying too long
inone place. After the war, Mond
moved to the United States and
now lives in Charlotte.

In 1940 Mond was 16 and lived

‘with his father, mother, and two
younger sisters. When the Ger-
mans basically arrived at their
doorstep in May, the family tried
to flee to France, but by that time
they couldn’t get past the border at
Calais as they planned because the
Germans had already captured the
town.

They then looked for a ship to
take them to England from the
coast of Belgium, but had no luck.
At that point, they returned to
Antwerp which was under military
occupation. They were lucky.

Pittard Wins
Rotary Scholarship

By Tom Koonce

Ruth Pittard, program advisor
at the Davidson College Union,
has won a Rotary Scholarship for
study at the University of Canter-
bury in Christchurch, New Zeal-
and

Pittard will study for a mas-
ter’s degree in English. She will
leave Davidson for a year begin-
ning in January 1992. The Rotary
Scholarship covers all of her ex-
penses during the year.

Pittard grew up in Conover,
North Carolina. She received a
degree in English teaching from
ECU. Pittard began work, at
Davidson in 1975 in the audiovis-
ual center and language lab. She
started her current job with the Un-
ion in 1984.

She decided to apply to the
University of Canterbury because

it offered the combination of a

master’s program and a good col-
lege union. While at the univer-
sity, Pittard will study how New
Zealanders relate their theories of
education to extracurricular activi-
ties.

Achance to further her educa-
tion motivated Pittard to apply for
the scholarship. She has always
wanted to go beyond undergradu-
ate work, but got caught up in edu-'
cating herchildren instead. Pittard
said, “Now I'll have a chance to
get back to the life of a student.”

Pittard received the scholar-
ship from Rotary’s District 767.
That district covers the Charlotte/
Mecklenburg area. The scholar-
ship requires that Pittard speak to
Rotary clubs in New Zealand dur-
ing her scholarship year, and to
Rotary clubs i in this area sar her
return. *

Kruze Hopeful of
Arab-Israeli Solution

By Jay Chaudhuri

The United States needs to
recognize the rights of the Pales-
tinians, according to Donald Kruze,
acurrent official with the State De-
partment, to a Carolina Inn audi-
ence last Wednesday night. “The
United States continues to be out
of line with world opinion con-
cerning the Palestinian situation.”

Kruze’s lecture “Palestine
Predicament, Israeli Dilemma”
suggested a menu of U.S. actions
that included giving Israel the will-
ingness to compromise; gaining
the confidence of Palestinians and
supporting their right to self-deter-
mination; gaining peace with Jor-
dan for a joint peace proposal;

dealing with the question of Jerusa- -

lem and the insuring time for tran-

sition when the changes occur.
“The, U.S. also needs to states its
willingness to participate in the
United Nations,” said Kruze. “The

West had a large hand in creating |

Israel and we should not abandon
our duty for reconciliation.“

Part of the dilemma in the
Middle East region is due to the
process of decolonization that
hastily resulted in Israel and twenty
other Arabnations after World War
II, said Kruze. “The anomaly of
the Middle Eastis that itconsists of
an old society in a new _nation-

State.” New rulers in the Middle
East have not bought psychologi-
cal satisfaction to their people,
according to Kruze, because the
region is tom between the Western
way of life and Arab culture.
Moreover, noted Kruze, no Arab
king is accountable to his people.

Yet the U.S. is also at fault
with the recent Gulf crisis because
Americans are ignorant of Middle
Eastern society, said Kruze.
“Reading the Arab mind is not an
American skill,” he said. None-

theless, Kruze felt that the U.S.can

play an important role in resolving
the current Arab-Israeli conflict.
“Perhapsitisadream,” said Kruze,.
“but it is a good dream.”

Kruzeisaretired Foreign Serv-
ice officer, having served as a po-
litical military specialist in Naples
and London. Hehasalso served as
consul from 1976-80 in Jerusalem
andalso workedas deputy director
in the Sinai mission from 1980-81.
He received his bachelor’s degree
from Wheaton College and mas-
ter’s degree in international affairs -
from the University of Pennsylva- -
nia. Kruze is a native of Philadel-
phia.

The ideas expressed by Kruze
were solely personal and did not
reflect the viewpoint of the State
Department:
