How do the
four years in college strike an intel-
ligent young man or woman—and on-
ly the highly intelligent will be able to
formulate significant verdicts—imme-
diately after they are over? Does the
time seem to have been well spent?
How much was learned? What was
gained in other directions—by social
contacts, and so on? How many of
the instructors encountered seemed to
have anything genuinely valuable to
impart? Was lifedin general, pleas-
ant or not? Is there any feeling at
the end that equipment has been im-
proved? Does college arouse a desire
for further learning, or do.the four
years seem enough?

The contestants will be expected to
name their colleges, and to give the
names of any teachers they may dis-
cuss, especially those who have struck
them as competent. The final day for
sending in MSS. has been put beyond
commencement time, so that frankness
need not imperil diplomas. The MSS.
submitted will be judged by their hon-
esty, their intelligence, their freshness
of viewpoint, and their interest as hu-
man documents. The competition is
open to the students of all American
colleges of good repute. Contestants
will be free to discuss all of the inat-

ters suggested, or any one of them, or
anything outside them. It is desired
to give them the utmost practicable
freedom, MSS. may be sent in at any
time before July I. The names of all
contestants save the prize-winners will
cbe held strictly confidential.
