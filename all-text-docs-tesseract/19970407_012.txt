What was actually the most
impressive, though, were the scads
of people on the field who were
really and truly frolicing. Sure, the

The Intimate Perfor-
mance Committee is gen-
erally known for bringing
Davidson laid-back, acous-

tic-based music, but on
Saturday night, Chapel
Hill’s Archers of Loaf de-
livered a more straight-
ahead rocking show than
Davidson has seen ina long
time.
Prior to the show, gui-
tafist and singer Eric
Bachmann expressed con-
cern over playing colleges,
saying that the bandis never
sure whether the Crowd will
just be confused or will ac-
tually get into the music.
As things turned out Satur-
day night, the crowd in the
900 Room was anxious to
move to the high energy
set.

The Archers began their one
hour set mostly with material from
their latest full length, All the Na-
tions Airports, from the dirge-like
“Distance Comes in Droves” to the
more poppy “Scenic Pastures” and
“Form and File.” By mid-set, they
dipped into their older songs such
as “Nevermind the Enemy” and
“Underdogs of Nipomo.” Toward
the end of the concert, they even
brought out their live classics like
“Plumbline” and the encore of
“Web in Front” (which really got
people moving) and “Slo-Worm.”

Throughout the show, the
crowd matched the energy level of
the band, bouncing to the rock songs
and bobbing their heads to the
slower ones.

To help create their sound, the
band used a variety of guitars with
special ‘‘adjustments” such as dif-
ferent tunings and strange string-
ing methods. They also employed
a sampler to generate sound loops
over their two-guitars-bass-and-

found hedging the “track” (I use the
term loosely), dodging frisbees and
water guns so as to not muss their
coiffes or soil their crisp linen, but
the majority of students were getting
down and dirty. No doubt the
competetive drive blazed through
more than a few keep-away players
and lawn dart fans, but the atmo-
sphere remained one of relativly
good-natured fun.

Other events during the week-
end included the International Ball

the music itself, the exc;
quality did not
go unnoticed.
The Archers’
sound guy,
Craig, even
commented on
how outstand-
ing they
sounded.

The Ar-
chers’ last stop
onamini-tour of
the Carolinas
before they play
an 18-date Mid-
west tour, Sat-
urday night’s
concert hope-
fully sent the
group off feel-

and a poetry reading on the Union
patio Saturday afternoon where stu-
dents shared both published and
personal poems.

Saturday night featured the Ar-
chers of Loaf playing in the 900
Room toa large, enthusiastic, head-
bobbing crowd. Kudos to those
brave few who broke out of the bob.

And kudos, again, to all who
made Spring Frolics happen — we
may be able to frolic on our own,
but it’s not every day we can eat a

eGmne while wearing a velcro

ore confident that this
d knows how to “get
usic.
