for bringing qualified stu
cents from minority groups
to Davidson.

A student-operated concert
and lecture series financed
by grants from foundations is
another of Hartsell’s propos
als. He alsq advocates an
expanded intramural pro-
gram to compete with teams
of the town of Davidson and
to involve the college com
munity in the affairs of the
town.

Hartsell wants to establish
an experimental college
which would give students
non-credit seminars and
courses which they cannot
presently obtain at Davidson.
This college would be held
In cooperation with Johnson

College and the University
of North Carolina at Char

Hartsell is a member of

vice president of the Stu-
dent Council and chairman

mittee of the Constitution Re

been vice president of his

Leadership Need

Serious--Smith

“In the position of presi-
dent, it’s the development of
an attitude of leadership
which is more essential than
any specifics ‘which a plat-
form could include."

This statement is the posi-
tion of John Smith whose

primary aim as_ president
would be ‘‘to instill a new
attitude ‘of cooperation be-
tween the student body and
the college as an institution."

“As next year we're going
to be minus a couple of ad-
ministration members. it is
essential that students take
advantage of positions which
will enable contacts between
the administration and the
students to create a better,
understanding and avoid such
attacks as the recent one on
Dean Burts.”’ Smith said.

“I wish to continue the im-
provement in the relationship
between the faculty and stu-
dent body which Tom Earn
hardt has _ inaugurated."
Smith added.

Smith said that he had filed
for the presidency before he
was aware that so many can-
didates were running. He
added that he was glad to.
see that such a strong slate
of candidates has been estab.
lished.

WILLIAMS ~
Williams
Foresees

New Ideas

John Williams, one of seven
candidates for the office of
Student Government Associa-
tion president for 1968-69,
foresees major changes in the
job of president.

‘Three of the most im-
portant things that the Stu-
dent Government Association
president will have to do
next year are organize the
new SGA, deal with prob.
lems raised by the new cur-
riculum and discuss campus
issues and life with the new
college president so that he
can get a perspective of life
at Davidson,"’ Williams said.

Williams said that his plat-
form consists of two main
points: maintaining dialogue
between the faculty, trustees.
administration and the stu-
dent body: and enabling the
student government to gain
the respect of the student
body.

Williams said he planned to
do the first by means of in-
creased student participation
in faculty committees and
faculty participation in stu-
dent committees and by re-
taining campus meetings.
such as the one held several
weeks ago with Deans Rich-
ard C. Burts and Frontis W.
Johnston and Trustee William
White.

Williams has served as
THE DAVIDSONIAN report-
er to Studént Council meet-
ings this year and has been
a reporter for three years. He
served in YMCA tutorial
work. for two years and fs
a member’ of Stimulys and
Pi Kappa Alpha.

Orienting,
Adjusting

Dave Clemmons, candidate
for student body president.
believes that the most im-
portant task for next year's
president will be helping the
new college president adjust
and orient himself to David-
son.

“The student body presi-
dent will have to be able to
relate to the new college
president,”’ he said.

Another issue Clemmons
feels will be of importance
is the new code of student
conduct presently being cre-
ated by the Committee on
Rules And _ Punishments
(CRAP). Clemmons, a mem
ber of the committee, ex:
pects the new regulations to
place more responsibility on
students for their behavior.

He also wants Davidson to
have a symposium like the
IMPACT symposium being
held this year at Vanderbilt,
to which this year’s Student
Council is sending five David-
son delegates.

Clemmons, who transfer-
red to Davidson last year
from Vanderbilt, feels he is
well suited to organize such
a Symposium, since he was
a member of the committee
at Vanderbilt which organ-
ized the symposium of two
years ago.

“I also feel that the new
SGA president will havé to
set precedents for the im-
plementation of the new con-
stitution,'' Clemmons said.

_ Clemmons, a Sigma Chi
and fraternity rush chair-
man_ was president of his
freshman class at Vanderbilt.

Forbid Students
Lying, Trice Says

The Honor Syste:n should
be changed so as to forbid
students to lie in any circum.
stances.

This is one of the main
planks in Ashton  Trice's
platform which also recom-
mends changes in the punish-
ment policy of the Honor
Code -in order to make pun-
ishment commensurate with
the seriousness of the of-
fense.

“I think that the degree to
which a crime endangers the
college system should de-
termine the severity of the
punishment."

Trice also lists two other
basic proposals. The first is
to continue the Committee on
Rules and _ Punishments
(CRAP) and expand its
membership, despite the fact
that it will have already
made its report by next year.

He denied reports that he
was opposed to either volun-
tary ROTC or subsidized
athletics and termed a rumor
that he wished to abolish stu-
dent government ‘‘absolutely
false.”

Frank Murphy

Plans Moderation

Frank Murphy, president
of the Junior Class, is basing
his platform on a concept of
moderation.

He hopes to bring about a
modification in the present
drinking rule to allow drink-
ing in specified areas of the
campus.

He also hopes to change
the present dormitory rules
to allow open dormitories at
certain hours and, to bring
about improvements in the
dorms themselves.

The concept which under-
lies all of his platform is in-
tegrating the social and aca-
demic areas of Davidson
life.

Major problems next year,
Murphy feels, will be work-
ing. with the new president
of the college, initiating the
Blue Sky changes, working
for. a new drinking policy,
and enacting the recommen-
dations of the Committee. on
Rules and Punishments.

MURPHY

Murphy, a member of Phi
Delta Theta, was president

of his sophomore class. He
was a member of the com-
mittee for the Residence Hall
Association and the student
recruitment. committee and
is a varsity baseball player.

Newspaper Candidates Take Positions

Hooker

The student newspaper at Carolina a few years
back ran on the solemn slogan that its job was “to print.

the news and raise hell.”

That, in brief, should be the role of THE DAVID-

SONIAN.

THE DAVIDSONIAN — believe it or not — is a
very good sma: college newspaper. Its consistent
award-winning proves as much.

But it can be better.

THE DAVIDSONIAN needs
more readability. It is often
dull and lifeless, for it is
dealing with a generally dull
campus and is read by gen.
erally apathetic students.

THE DAVIDSONIAN needs
more reliability. It is all too
often inaccurate.

THE DAVIDSONIAN needs
a better organized and coor-
dinated staff to insure this
reliability and to create a
more readable newspaper.
This newspaper should not
be so much a one man show.

Therefore. ] will work to

create:

-A vigorous, constructive
editorial policy in which no

toes will be safe from..being. .

stepped on. J will continue
and expand the present edi-
tor’s editorial board—to as.
sist in writing editorials and
shaping overall policy.

—Objective, accurate news
pages. Emphasis will be
placed on in-depth. reporting
of both campus and beyond-

campus issues, and a team
of expcrienced, conscientious
reporters win b® formed to
ensure more complete cover
age of campus affairs.

—Entertaining, informative
features, including more
“brites’’ and human interest
material on the news pages.

~—More colorful sports pag
es. The paper's sport pages
should follow the format of
an afternoon daily, that is,
they should contain more per
sonality features and behind.
the scenes stories.

THE DAVIDSONIAN can be
made more reliable and more
readable without becoming
a scandal sheet. I believe. |
can do it.

1 sabmit three years’ %x-
perience on this newspaper
as a reporter, news editor
and managing editor. plus
two summers’ professiona!
newspaper experience,“as an
indication of my eagerness—
and ability-.to edit a news
paper. that the student body
will want to read.

Jasper

QUALIFICATIONS: NONE! I have no qualifications

whatever for this office .

.. none at all. In fact, if 1 am

elected (and stranger things have happened) I will
delegate everything except the responsibility of the
office and the editorials to my opponents. WHY AM |]
RUNNING? Because I feel that in the three years that
1 have been at Davidson THE DAVIDSONIAN has done
little more than alienate fraternity men, unsuccessfully
try to mirror student sentiment, and stay out of

trouble. If I am elected the
following will be the stand
of the 1968-1968 DAVIDSON.
TAN:

1. We know we drink on
campus, the faculty knows
we drink on campus. and
Ranger Smith knows we drink
on campus. Therefore there
will be a front page headline
editorial until realism  re-
turns to Davidson.

2. Until a better plan is
presented, for the first time
in memory THE DAVIDSON-
IAN will not be anti-frater.
nity.

3. ‘Specific disciplinary ac-
tions are more likely to evoke
a thoughtful, considered re-
sponse from other students if
they have confidence that col-
lege authorities -will attempt
to make fair and intelligent
{ judgments.” ‘That just about
} covers the position in regard

&to the Dean of Students...

4. The Davidson Student
Government Association will
be supported as an instru-
ment of the students and THE
DAVIDSONIAN- will once
again refléct the opinion of
the majority of students in-its

- editorials; however, , guest

columnists will present their
views in a format similar to
“POST” magazine.

3. Apathy is the keynote
that will be presented so
many times during the next
two months of elections that
you'll want to puke. There-
fore, no editorials will be run
concerning the apathy of Da-
vidson students.

6. Such things as open dor-
mitories (not as bad as it
sounds, Mom!), abolition of
fraternity house curfews, and
easier conditions for rooming
off.campus will be campaign.
ed for in cooperation with the
SGA.

7. Why not bring the wail-
ing wall where it will be seen
by all the students .. . to the
paper.

8. LET'S STIR UP A HOR.
NET'S NEST ABOUT WHAT
WE WANT AND NOT RE.
-ELEGT ONLY. THE , VIEWS
OF WHAT THE FACULTY
WILL LET US HAVE! !

So if you're interested, I'l!
be happy to have your vote
and if you just don’t give a
damn Till be glad to take
your vote. too... I ain't
proud.

Reid

A student newspaper should be more than an an-
nouncement sheet and more than the tool of a small
number of students. Rather it should be a positive
force in the life of the school. To do this, it must report
in detail the issues which affect the life of the college
and must campaign vigorously for student rights.

From the editorial columns, this newspaper should
take the initiative in petitioning administration, trus-
tees and student government for reforms, such as
modification of the drinking rule, increased student
representation on faculty committees and formation of

joint student-trustee commit-
tees to meet regularly to dis-
cuss campus life.

On the news and feature
pages, this newspaper needs
to print lively, informative
reports on campus and na-
tional issues which affect stu-
dents. Examples of this in-
clude draft taw revisions and
the work of the Committee
on Rules and Punishment.
Too often THE DAVIDSON-
IAN has given surface treat
ment to these important top-
ics. :

Sports should not remain a
neglected department on this
newspaper. The staff should
be enlarged so the sports ed-
itor can give the readers
more color - feature stories
rather than rehash old
games.. Coverage of ir.za-

‘sy mural sports should be en-

larged, too.

Also. THE DAVIDSONIAN
must remain an independent
force in campus life, and
must not fall under control
of specia’ interest cliques.
This independence must al-
ways be maintained.

Finally, this newspaper
needs to become a vigorous,
useful force in the life of this
campus. THE DAVIDSON.
IAN needs to be jolted into
action. Unless this happens,
reading this newspaper will

become as worthless an exer-.

cise as attending compulsory
vespers.

My experience as reporter,
assistant sports.editar. sparts.
editor and managing editor
plus two summers’ work on
professional newspapers and
part-time work as a writer
for United Press Internation-
al, will, I feel, enable me to
present an exciting, Torceful
newspaper.

Presidency

Joe Murphy: Need
To Be ‘Forceful’

“What I want to do is get
someone forceful as president
of the student body."’ Joe
Murphy said.

Murphy, a candidate for
the presidency, believes that
the major problem with this
year’s Student Council was
that ‘‘we would bring up an
issue, then we would form a
committee to study it, and
the committee would recom-
mend its findings to a faculty
committee, where the issue
would get lost."

Gpen dorms, drinking on
campus and being able to
schedule one's own exams
are three other proposals in
Murphy's campaign.

“These things are sort of
Lusies,”’ he said. “I would
also like to have a student
present at every faculty
meeting and a faculty mem-
ber present at important stu-
dent government meetings.”

Murphy, who fulfilled his
last campaign promise of

bee ee

getting vending machines in
every dormitory, also work-
ed to secure more physical
education cuts for freshmen
and sophomores. He is the
Student Council representa-
tive from the junior class
and is a member of the Com-
mittee on Rules and Punish-
ments. He is a member of
Alpha Tau Omega.
