Class of '98 plays it up in pre-court season, ready for first night down

By Elizabeth Coleman

This weekend, freshmen will
get their first legal exposure to
Patterson Court. Despite restless-
ness during the three-week restric-
tion from Patterson Court, most
freshmen have utilized the time by
bonding and getting to know their

classmates.

“It’s important to get to know
the people in your class because
they’re the ones you’ll be spend-
ing the next four years of your life
with. After all, you never know—
your next door neighbor might turn
out to be your bridesmaid,” says

freshman Jennifer Neal.

Freshmen relax at the lake after the regatta during the all campus

fall festival.

Alcohol-free activities sched-
uled for freshmen include hall mix-
ers, during which girls and guys
get to know each other through
pie-making contests, body paint-
ing, and games like “Win, Lose or
Draw.”

The class of 1998 spent its
first weekend at Davidson square

dancing and gambling at Casino
Night. One freshman girl said,
“Square Dancing was really cool
because everyone let loose and
made fools of themselves to-
gether.”

Country line dancing, karaoke,
and “Freshmen Feud” were among
activities offered at Casino Night.

Freshman Tom Kapioltas says, “I
sang ‘Mony Mony' and a bunch of
country songs I didn’t know in my
unharmonious voice. It was a
blast.”

Freshmen ended their first
week of classes with a trip to a

Patterson Court opens to freshmen soon

Members of the Class of 1998
eagerly anticipate their first night
down on Patterson Court, which
should an exciting night for fresh-
men and upperclassmen alike.

Three years ago, freshmen
were forced to wait six weeks be-
fore venturing to fraternity/eating
house parties. The period of time
was shortened in order to alleviate
the mystique of the Court.

Freshman Advisors John
Murchison and Wendy McHugh
explain the shift. "The longer they
(freshmen) wait, the bigger deal it
becomes," says Murchison.
McHughagrees: "Freshmen won't
feel obligated to prove whata great
first night they had."

This weekend's festivities will
begin Friday afternoon at SAE with
a reggae band co-sponsored by
Warner Hall.
