As long as a squad of twenty reason-
ably experienced and willing athletes can
be recruited Davidson should put a foot-
ball team in the field. The game 1s not
played for the sake of winning only; nor
for the glory of Davidson supremacy over
other colleges. The game is played for
the value of developing true sportsman-
ship, co-operation, co-ordination, consci-
ciousness of the value of team play, com-
petitive effort among groups of individu-
ousness of the value of team play, com-
other good game.

If we say we must have no team except
one of experts we would have to banish
big league baseball for the duration, be-
cause the better players are largely gone
to the war.

All thing are relative and it is conceded
today that the average college cannot as-
semble athletic teams in any sport that can
compete with even a well staffed prep
school. It is no disgrace to put on the
field a group of relatively green talent and
perhaps lose games. The few colleges
who can avail themselves of Army and
Navy talent are well known, and obvious-
ly must be avoided in scheduling.

Obviously schedules will be odd and
partially haphazard. As the season pro-
gresses, possibilities will develop. Any
sport.at any time is more worth whiteand
interesting when teams are evenly match-
ed. The current sittiation offers unusual
opportunity to do just this. Perhaps it
may mean some high school or prep school
games.. This would be no disgrace—why
should it? Perhaps both the prep school
and Davidson might benefit from such
contacts.

Here is an ‘Opportunity to make new
friends indeed, to try out contacts that
could develop to be of permanent schedule
advantage, ‘here may never be another
such chance.

Also it might be pointed out that many
boys who would ordinarily not make even
a varsity squad would have the oppor-
tunity*for such stimulating and unusual
experience. The adage that every cloud
has its silver lining—that out of every
bad thing often comes some good, would
be heaven for these boys; it might mean
much to them all their lives they never
otherwise would have had!

_There are many other arguments. One
is the thought of “keeping the home fires
burning”-as much as possible. The boys
overseas want this; more than anything
they want to come back to find. things just
as they were. They want the structures
maintained of the routines and customs
they loved. Anether point is that many
of the seventeen year olds, the medical
students—even 4F’s—may often be real
athletes. Why deprive them of their op-
portunities for collegiate competition and
experience.

Davidson is known for its men, its
ideals, its sportsmanship, and its spiritual
attainments rather than any number of

winning teams. Any group of boys ap-
pearing in public competition, whether
they be football players or musicians;
whether they be young or old; whether
they be good or bad; whether they play
in New York, Raleigh, Kannapolis, or
Cornelius, can still be capable of main-
taining and spreading abroad Davidson’s
splendid heritages of Christian influence
and honorable tradition. Let’s go!

Con...

The question of the participation of D.
C. in intercollegiate athletics next fall is
one which has been widely discussed on
the campus this summer. For some men,
the prospects are dismal while to others
the possibility of fielding a team is quite
likely and they think that without too
much trouble Davidson could find enough
talent to have a winning team.

Throughout the years, D. C. has had a
team, noted for its scrappy spirit and
punch. The Red and Black in past years
has won many a ball game against op-
ponents from schools many times their
size in number of eligible students. Dav-
idson, though so very much smaller, each
year has played V. M. I. and N. C. State.
Invariably, though with a deficiency. in
number, we have put up games which
draw commendation from our opponents.
The Davidson spirit and its ability to put
out dangerous elevens enjoys a reputation
which reaches throughout the entire
South and well up into the North. Why
shall we fail to produce a team this year
with a reputation like that at stake? Let
me tell you.

The Student Body at Davidson now
numbers less than ever before in its his-
tory except during the Civil War. We
have less than 200 men to choose a team
from. The team that a coach would draw
from this number would be sorely lacking
in substitutes even though the first eleven
men might be of the better class of foot-
ballers. This team would be composed of
seventeen year old civilians with practical-
ly no real experience. Lack of experience
is a direct pointer to injury. Many men
might be playing for the first time and,
amdng beginners, damage flourishes.
Some boys, because of the lack of materi-
al, might be tempted onto the field to try
out for the team although they were not
physically fit to play ball. This would be
a terrible thing for one easily might be
hurt if he were.in this category.

In order to stay “‘out of the red”’ financ-
ially during a football season, the teams
must play before moderate sized crowds.
With the rationing of gasoline becoming
more and more strict by the minute, it
would be out of the question to suppose
that Davidson could play before suffic-
ient crowds throughout the year. The
prospective spectator will take into con-
sideration what the crowds will number
before he attends a ball game. The color
of the crowd adds or detracts much to a
game.

Almost without exception, colleges in
the predicament in which our fair Alma
Mater finds itself have decided to suspend
intercollegiate football for the duration.
This means that there will be little, if any
competition for the Wildcats next fall.
Schools re-enforced by the Navy trainees
will most probably offer football on the
competitive basis. With only these to
play, our outlook grows darker and our
gloom deepens. Once again, as in prev-
ious years, Davidson will be scheduled as
an easy game that will be a sure victory
for the opponent. Once again, as in prev-
ious years, it will fall Davidson’s lot to be
the team of spirit, the team that never
gives up, the team that always carries on
although they are completely out-classed.
We will again be the team that makes a
dull game for the powerful opposition.
We will again be the team that tries in
vain to throw a scare into its formidable
Opponent.

It Could
Be Worse

Typographical Erring

For many years The Davidsonian
which is not proof-read by its edit:
vrs, has been’ notorious for ity
typographical errors. In the last
volume a front page headline read
“Student ‘Boyd Elects Officers.”
Once “professor” was spelled three
different ways in the same paragraph
(profesor, proffessor, and the right
way). That's no worse, however,
than the 4000 ways of spelling
“Shakespeare” (Shakespear, Scak-
esper, Shaksper, Shakespere, et ce-
tera. The complete tist is found
in “A Plea for Simplified Spelling.”
He is said to have spelled it sev-
eral different ways in his own will).

Even newspapers like The New
York Times, whose copies the David-
son College library has seen fit to
keep bound because of its reputable
accuracy and clarity, often jumps the
track, as in this want ad: “Chauffeur,
white, nice quarters, beautiful coun-
try home exchanged for services;
kind treatment; could use wife.”

A worse catastrophe than this, how-
ever, occurred when the magazine of
the University of Arizona ran this
advertisement :

From Worse

To Bed

By AL McNAIR

In combating disease, no one will
dispute that attention to minor cases
is the first important step in any
successful control of the more ser-
ious disease. Each student coming to
Davidson has a peculiar condition
in respect to his own physical per-
son, and while some minor disease
is not serious to some students, for
others it would develop into a ser-
ious condition. This calls for early
treatment as well as does the fact
that many of the so-called minor
diseases are contagious and are
therefore dangerous to the health of
the student body as a whole.

The Infirmary misses its purpose
in not being available to any mem-
ber of the student body for immed-
iate attention in the case of sickness
which requires attention to promote
the health, not only of that parti-
cular individual but also of the
whole student body, The two-and-a-
half hours a day during which the
student body can visit the Infirmary
are wholly inadequate, for many of
the students have conflicts either
with classes or other compulsory
activity

The student has a right to expect
medical care in the case of an emer-
gency and an arrangement must be
made so that he can receive court-
cous admittance if and when it is
necessary. Of cotirse with a disease
as Polio being so prevelent, it is
more important than ever that the
Infirmary stand ready to carry out
the peventive measures at any time
it is called on to do so.

There is a shortage of personnel,
but this éxists everywhere and in
the case of essential activity, men
and women all over the country
have done wonders. No one will say
for a moment that this is non-essen-
tial. All are carrying heavy burdens
during the war. The Infirmary in
order to serve its purpose must do
so too. :

There’s a boy now among the stu-
dents who was sick for a week be-
cause instead of spending two min-
utes to mop his throat, the disease
was allowed to spread into his lung
which has always been weak.

The Infirmary must have definite
hours for its work, but in the case
of an emergency when the student
cannot go to it at any other time,
an exception must be made rather
than putting the boy out simply
because he is there out of hours and
in the meantime allowing the disease
to develop with impediment.
