A Tribute And A Task

Students here are often cited as
being unusually hard, cynical, apathe-
tic, sophisticated, ete, and usually
such charges have a substantial basis.
But last Friday, as radios all over the
campus told of the incredible assas-
sination of the President, something
began happening as facades disap-
peared into dismayed shock.

Friday afternoon we saw these

same students wandering

in the halls or sitting on the edge of
a bed, staring at the floor. Saturday
morning the college church was jam-
med for a special service, and in a
few classes professors sat down and
explained as best they could the sig-
nificance of what had happened.

Then Sunday afternoon over 150
students spontaneously got up from
watching television and headed to
Washington to pay a first-hand tribute
to the only President our generation
has ever really identified with. Many
went in cars, some.caught buses, and
not a few hitchhiked up Sunday night.

Professors were unanimous i

called off Monday classes and even
encouraged students who could to go
to Washington.

No doubt some saw the cancella-
tion of Monday’s classes as something
students would take advantage of, but
the student reaction in that respect
made it seem to us that a genuine
tribute was intended rather
mere curiosity—by far the majority
of those who went to Washington
were in class Tuesday,

We hope that the feeling of tragedy
and sadness that surrounded and
lingers after the Washington burial
will carry over into an awareness that
more than ever before, our genera-

come the hatred that exists between
races and between fanatic extremists
on both left and right—to overcome
the hatred that is slowly eroding the
moral core of this country, and that

Vietnam: Catholics, Reds
Irrelevant To Its Situation

BY PAUL A. MARROTTE
Associate Professor of History

Whatever else it might be, Vietnam is a study in irrelevancy. And the sad his-
tory since 1945 of that former French colony has only pointed up the dilemma of
irrelevant domestic relationships and irrelevant solutions to serious and pressing

problems.

Take, for example, the
emergence of a communist state
of North Vietnam. The real is-
sue which brought communism
into a position of power in 1954
was definitely not economic dif-
ficulties but the strong emotion
of native nationalism against
the long-time foreign oppression
maintained by the French.

Actually, communism, with
a@ theoretical “international.
ism” of its own, was irrele-
vant to the political and eco-
nomic problems facing the
Vietnamese in their struggle
against the French from 1945
to 1954. Yet, there was no way
of denying to the Vietnamese
communists a decede ago the
tremendous harvest of popu-
larity accompanying their na-
tionalistic propaganda against
the French.

Today, communism has com-
pletely irrelevant answers to
South’ Vietnam’s political and
economic problems.

Or take the example of the
Diem family regime in South
Vietnam since 1955. Here we see
a newly-independent state
(South Vietnam) being directed,
and increasingly so, by a bu-
reaucracy largely controlled by
a family clan of much wealth.

In case the reader has missed
the point, the bureaucratic

~

“I

control by a clan of wealth in a
newly-independent Asian state
is entirely irrelevant to practi-
cal, successful national govern-
ment.

No one doubts that in times
of government crises. democra-
tic procedures are irrelevant.
But, the point which the Ameri-
ean critics of the Diem regime
made during the past six months
was that clan government which
rejected policies designed to
encourage popular support was
doomed.

Clan government almost by
definition is irrelevant in South-
east Asia today, but to alienate
popular support was stupidity
as its utmost. The scoundrel of
Indonesia, President Sukarno,
has learned this lesson well, and
the least type of protection
which he needs is an armed
fortress against his people for
a palace.

One can also claim that as
the religion of the Diem gov-
ernment, Catholicism was en-
tirely irrelevant to the relig-
ious setting of South Viet-
nam. While it is true that
militarized Buddhist sects ser-
iously impaired the domestic
peace and security of South
Vietnam in the mid-1950’s,
government by persons favor-
ing Catholicism over Budd-

hism in this predominantly
Buddhist country was openly
asking for trouble.

Without doubt, if President
Diem had been a Buddhist ‘he
would still be in power in Sai-
gon today.

Perhaps the most glamorous
irrelevancy to appear on the
world political scene in quite
some time is Madame Nhu her-
self. In terms of what she rep-
resented, and particularly, what
she said, she was irrelevant.

She had just one theme:
“those dirty communists and
small-time Americans are try-
ing to kick us out.” The relev-
ant questions, such as, how
does one fight a successful war
against communist guerillas in
South Vietnam, she refused to
face. This refusal reveals her
lack of any real political
acumen, and must have height-
ened for her the shock of the
news of the military coup.

Perhaps the most dangerous
irrelevancy of all is the possi-
bility that the crisis in South
Vietnam will become an issue
in the American presidential
campaign of 1964. If the new
military government in Saigon
fails to pursue the war more
successfully than Diem’s gov-
ernment, the result will be an
important campaign issue next
summer. As one reporter com-
mented, “The military govern-
ment had better win the war,
for the sake of the present Ad-
ministration.”

The only answer is that, if
the present military govern-
ment cannot ~ ‘eat the com-
munists, they are not going
to be defeated by anyone,
with or without American aid.
it is that irrelevant to an
American presidential cam-
paign.

At this point, the reader
‘might well ask, “Is it really
this involved to get. at the basic
issues o£ contemporary affairs,
such as the crisis in South Viet-
nam?” The answer is that the
basic issues stand clearly for
all to see, once you willingly
east aside the mass of irrelev-
ancy.

Critics Present Views
On ‘A Separate Peace’

BY WILLIAM WALKER
The agonizing process of a
boy’s maturing is the theme of
John Knowles’ first novel,
A Separate Peace.

The setting is the microcosin
of a New England prep school
during World War IT. The title
alludes to the fact that the
protagonist, Gene Forrest,
‘makes his peace” with the
world. For Gene and his pal
Phineas, the war is far remov-
ed—and likely a fake. A farce
conjured up by “fat old men”
as Phineas puts it.

By using such a microcosm,
Knowles is saying that each
man’s enviromuent contains all
the possibilities for good and
evil.

Gene hates Phineas, a superb
athlete, because Phineas has an
uncanny power over him: he
goads Gene into committing
acts, which.. while they are not
bad, are not the things Gene
would do if left to himself.

Gene can’t endure the
thought that he’s relinquishing
his independence to Phineas,
and that Phineas has indeed
become a necessary part of him.
When he suspects Phineas of
trying to hurt his grades, the
one thing he can be unexcelled
in, his situation becomes unen-
durable.

He hurts Phineas in the worst
way he can be hurt—physically,
as an athlete—by pushing him
out of a tree, crippling him for
life. Phineas still maintains an
influence over Gene, however.
Not until Phineas dies from
a second, accidental fall does
Gene seem to find release.

Unlike the hero of The Cat-
cher in the Rye, whose prob-
lems seem insoluble, Gene con-
cludes that hoe conquered his
enemy. But does this mean that
he overcame whatever in him
made him push Phineas out of
the tree, or does it mean that
Phineas himself represented an
enemy that had to be sonquer-
ed before Gene could be him-
self? Knowles’ answer is not
clear,

A Seperate Peace, while it
cannot match Catcher in the
Rye for acridity and force of
expression, is a compact and
polished narrative.

BY BILL FERRIS

It has been said that great
men both open and close doors
to those who follow them. When
a great artist deals with a sub-
ject it is often done so well
that efforts by others on the
same .subject appear sick in
contrast to his.

I am afraid that John
Knowles’ fits the category of
those who follow the master;
the master in this case being
John Salinger. A Separate

Peace is a very weak attempt
to capture the prep-school at-
mosphere Salinger describes so
well in A Catcher in the Rye.

Knowles manages to break
his silent sea of words occasion-
ally with scenes like Brinker’s
trial of Phineas. Unfortunately
these scenes lose their effect as
soon as the narrator reenters
with his cold, clinical descrip-
tions. The above scene, for in-
stance, ends with a sentence
beginning, “The excellent ex-
terior acoustics recorded his
rushing steps . . . then these
separate sounds collided into
the general tumult of his body
falling clumsily down the white
marble steps.”

So what? Who gives a damn
about “excellent acoustics?” The
reader is concerned with the
emotions of Phineas who has
just stormed out of the room.

Knowles tries to describe
these and other emotions and in
doing so he explains them
away. His entire novel is too
filled with dry descriptions. It
lacks the action and emotion
necessary for the reader to as-
sociate himself with the work.
The suggested suffering and
despair of two youths is never
made clear to the reader. They
lie buried beneath Knowles’ de-
scriptions and lack of feeling
for his subject.

BY W. H. TILLEY

A Separate Peace concerns a
young man who at a New Eng-
land school during the second
world war struggles with and
kills his roommate and best
friend. He does not kill him di-
rectly. He jars him from the
limb of a tree, breaking his
leg; later the leg is broken
again and the friend dies while

it is being set. We understand
that the friend dies because he
has been made to see that he
was injured deliberately, that
his roommate has crippled him
for life. The young man respon-
sible for this injury and death,
having learned from the friend
he feared and hated how to con-
quer fear and hate is at last
ready to take a man’s place in
the world.

Events of the novel—possibly
excepting the death of a young
man from the operation of set-
ting his broken leg—are plausi-
ble enough. The characters are,
if not compelling, convincing.
The one weakness of the novel
—or at least the salient one—
lies in the idea that someone
can conquer hatred and fear by
contact with someone whom he
has deliberately killed.

Neither fhis nor any other
idea in the novel is new. But
familiarity does not make them
more persuasive. However
smoothly the story is told, how-
ever well its incidents are put
together, however its main
characters convince us—we
must return to the same prob-
lem: is it possible for a young
man to gain tranquillity of
spirit from someone whose
“harmonious and natural unity”
he has personally destroyed? It
hardly seems likely. Nor can
any way of looking at the
novel—metaphorically, symboli-
cilly, allegorically, or whatever
—make this problem seem any
less important.

Students Reflect

BY BILL FERRIS

“All ah could do was cry when they told me the
news,” whispered the colored cook. I nodded and walked
out of the kitchen, understanding the twisted empty look
of her face. He is gone. Her tribute to him was a few
tears wept in a dark corner.

These years seem filled to bursting with the hatred
and death of such innocent people. We have seen the
nightmare of riots at Ole Miss; the death of innocent
children worshiping in Birmingham; and now the death
of our president. What is happening to our country?

With the president’s death our Dream of Democra-
cy has slumped a little lower. He stood for the goals our
forefathers dreamed of when they wrote “liberty and
justice for all.” He stood for the innocents slain in Miss-
issippi and Alabama. And now he lies dead.

Our hearts are growing old and hard with so much
hatred. Who among us has the softness left in his heart
to weep at this tragic death? We want to scream that
the world is too much with us but lack the strength.

Where do we go from here? We cannot surrender
the dream for which he died. It is time we cease our
loud words of hate and look within ourselves for a gentle
love that will let us live together in peace.

BY JOE HOWELL

Last week many Davidson students experienced the
greatest tragedy in their lifetime. The president could
not have been shot. He could not have died. It just was
not possible. The confusion, doubts, and despair sent
pangs of fear, hate, and insecurity running through the
insides of many of us, causing us to look bewildered at
each other and ask Why, why did it happen? What is our
world coming to? °

We drifted to the church at 8 o’clock on a gray,
drizzly morning. We tried to pray, but somehow there
weren’t any words. We. tried to sing the hymns, but
somehow our voices would not behave. We tried to smile,
and we did, but we knew the hollowness inside. We tried
to justify the act. We looked for causes, for answers. We
talked until late at night. Yet somehow the pain would
not leave.

We drifted to class. Certainly the professors would
share our grief. Perhaps they would have some insight, -
some consolation. They are men of learning, men of
wisdom, Christian men of commitment. If they would
not give us answers, they would share with us our doubts,
despair, and frustration. Yet, in the classroom, we ex-
perienced even mére frustration; for most professors
lectured as always, as if nothing had happened. Sure,
they were hurt. They must have been, but now was not
the time to talk about such a thing. The material must
be studied, and the class must proceed as usual.

Yes, the class must proceed — but isn’t there some
relation between history and the murder of the presi-
dent, between Christianity and the chaotic world of
which we are a part, between economics and the results
which such a tragedy will have on our country. We
should not let such a tragedy effect our classes we are
told, it really isn’t that bad. But, we scream hopelessly,
it is that bad. There is something wrong with our society.
The shooting of the president is only a symptom of the
insecurity and despair that all of us feel. If history, Eng-
lish, economics, and psychology have nothing to say
about our world, then why waste our time in class?
Christianity has nothing to say then why go on pretend-
ing any longer? If men have commitment, if they feel
any relation between their subject, between Christianity
and the world in which we live, now is the time to ex-
press their commitment.

Best of luck fo

The Wildcats in the coming
basketball season.
