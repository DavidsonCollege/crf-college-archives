TWELVE THOUSAND PLEDGES

will be used to build a new Chambers’ build-

ing. The college authorities are going to|

have the work started on the south wing of
the building as soon as the corrected plans
are in their possession and bids are received
from the contractors.

There was an unavoidable delay in the let-
ting of the contract of the Chambers build-
ing because of the decision of the architect,
Mr. Hibbs, of Nashville, that changes could
be made in the plans of the building which
would add to its beauty without any addi-
tional expense being incurred in its construc-
tion. These changes are almost completed
and it is expected that work will be started
on the building at an early date.

The Young Matrons Club was enter-
tained by Mrs. Kenneth Foreman last
Friday afternoon at four o’clock.

| Students vs. Smallpox
| The cold shoulders presented to!
| strangers coming into Davidson are}
nothing more than preventions against)
fondling of the sore arms with which all |
boys are acquanited. Smallpox
made its appearance and vaccination |
forthwith became the fad. Sore tempers
have ‘been the result of some of the
scratches and the infirmary has housed !
|a few, among them being Martin Teague,
R. G, Faucette, Harry Price, Niblock, J.
J. Clark, Taylor, Kornegay, and Ernest
Milton. The scare is rapidly passing off
with the advent of vaccination although
many say that they prefer the disease to
the cure, !

Dr. Sparks Addresses ‘Students
Dr. Edwin E, Sparks, president-emeritus |
of Penn, State College addressed the stu=!
dent body last Wednesday morning at!
the chapel period, in behalf of higher |
scholarship, He urged his hearers to
think of the importance of keeping in|
mind the idea of coming to college,
namely that-of acquiring an cducation |
and fitting one’s self for the battles of
life. His plea was for the building up of
a system of higher scholarship in the!
colleges of America, and he depicted the
results that will surely come from such |
an endeavor. He is making a tour of |
the South in the interest of his work, |
Dr. Arbuckle, a close friend of the speak: |

LITERARY SOCIETIES ADOPT
NEW PLAN FOR SPRING
TERM

At the last meeting of the literary

| societies before the examination period,

each of the four societies adopted the
plan submitted by Alpha Phi Epsilon
Literary Fraternity in regard to the

meetings will be held. Men of national | PTO8TaMs of the societies for the spring

term. A member of the fraternity from
each society presented the plan at the
regular meeting, and Professor Dendy
also attended the meetings and spoke
in behalf of the plan. The plan was en-
thusiastically adopted by the societies.

The plan was presented in full in a
former issue of the Davidson. In brief,
the plan follows.

Each society is to be organized as a
regularly constituted legislative body,
maintaining the same officers as under
the old plan. The regular debate of the
evening is to be eliminated, and in its
place an open discussion of a question

brought up at a previous meeting be
held. The reviewer or critic in the soci-
eties is to decide whom, of those speak-
ink during the meeting, shall be recom-
mended for credit toward graduation.
The meetings are to be held strictly in
| regard to rules of parliamentary pro-
| cedure, and will serve the double purpose
| of increasing interest in literary society
work, and to provide better opportunity
|in the practice of rules of parliamentary
procedure, Greater opportunity will al-
so be given members to take part in the
| meetings, which will enable the members
(to gain more credits in a given time.

What a difference

just a few cents make!”

Monk will devote his time to the other
sports.

The call for spring practice was issued
| last week and Monday about 60 men re-
| ported. This goes to prove that football
is an all-year sport. Coach Tex states
| that practice will start right at the bot-
|
|

tom and as soon as the men get harden-

jed he will scrimage them at least four
times a week: ‘The spring workout will
last two months, through February and
March. During this time the men will not |
be on training. As soon as basketball
| season is over certain football men who
are now playing basketball will report
for football practice.

| Owing to the condition of Richardson

| field the practice will take place on the
| Fresh field, golf links, and tennis courts.
| Of course there will be many days when
| practice outdoors cannot be held but
these days will be taken up with skull
practice indoors.

Along toward the latter part of the |
season there will be a game between a
team composed of men who have been
out for practice and a team made up of
football men who are graduating this
year. |

THE UNIVERSAL CAR

Forecasting A Tremendous

Spring Demand

739,626

more Ford cars and trucks were pro-
duced last year than the previous
year, an increase of over 5< per cent.

In spite of this tremendous increase in production, it was
impossible to meet delivery requirements during the spring

and summer months when orders for 350
and Trucks could not be filled.

000 Ford Cars

This year winter buying for immediate delivery has. been
more active than ever before—and in addition 200,000
orders have already been booked through the Ford Weekly

Purchase

Plan for spring delivery.

These facts clearly indicate that the demand during this
spring and summer will be far greater than ever, and that
orders should be placed immediately with Ford Dealers as

a means of protection against dela
