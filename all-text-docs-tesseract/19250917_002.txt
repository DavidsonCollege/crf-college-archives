Reserves Crowding Regulars for
Positions on Varsity Squad—
Season Opens Saturday

Tired and dusty—some of them—from
many weary hours of travel, the Davidson
Wildcats came back to Davidson, once more
to begin their football practice. They came
back around September 1, when there were
but few students to greet them and to give
them encouragements as they donned their
uniforms, to go out on the sultry field and
under the beating rays of the sun to practice
for hours each day.

The season will soon have been begun, In
the interim of September 1-19, the Wildcat
mentors have been training, drilling and
working with the men, in a tireless effort to
put an eleven on the gridiron this season that
will come through with victories. ‘They have
been mindful of the intense heat, however,
and at times have slackened in their practice,
realizing that it does not pay to work them
too hard,

Twelve letter men returned; seven did not.
Around that 12 the coaches will build their
team. Even though the freshman class of
last season sent up some good men, and even
though the trainers have some good scond
string material from last season, such regu-
lar varsity men as Boggs and Davis are go-
ing to be sorely missed, as well as the sub-
stitutes Hunt, Covington, McAulay and Sum-
mers. :

The 12 men returning were Baker, Vance,
Laird, McConnell, Pinkney, Bohannon, Sap-
penfield, Black, McComb, Leggette, Ander-
son.. With that even dozen men, and three
dozen more, will be built the Wildcat ma-
chine—as yet an unknown quantity.

There can be much speculation over the
Prospects of the entire season, The ex-
tremely optimistic see nothing but a glorious
season ahead. The semi-optimistic look at a
splendid reserve material and say that David-
son will have a good team, but use no super-
latives in describing it. Then there are the
conservatives, who are not willing to com-
mit themselves, but prefer to remain silent
and watch the season progress.

Twenty-two men were out for backfield
one day last week, and 24 for the line, which
is somewhat out of proportion for the num-
ber of places to be filled. But in that. 24
linemen are some men who will be well ac-
counted for before the season is over.

There is Red Grey pushing Joe McConnell
for center. McNeil, Baker, Maulden,
Mitchell and Vance are battling away for
guard position, Baker having been shifted to
that berth this season. Lincoln, Anderson,
Laird and Ritchie are a foursome of hefty
players, two of which are going to play
tackle.

Then there are the ends, Pinkney and
Bohannon, alternates on right end of last
season, are working zealously and tirelessly
for a regular place. They know that Arro-
wood and McEachern, of last year’s fresh-
man team, are pushing them close, and the
best man of the four wins. They are all
working hard and Coach Monk Younger will
have a good second string to run in.

Sappenfield will most likely run the team,
with Hewlett being used as a substitute
quarter, The coaches were somewhat wor-
ried for a while for a substitute quarter,
until Hewlett came back. Black is having

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

The surrounding hills of Davidson will
echo and re-echo two days from today with
the shrill blast of a referee’s whistle, and the
1925 Wildcat season will have been laurtgh-
ed. The Wildcat will have been let loos
once more to begin its clawing, scrapping,
fighting way through a season of 10 games.

Not only will the. Elon’ game Saturday
mark the beginning of the Wildcat season,
but North Carolina football fans will have
their chance to witness the first game. of |
1925. Only one other game will be played in|
the South that same day. |

Eleven men will be lined up on the field. |
Perhaps 30 more will be sitting on the side-
lines anxiously awaiting a chance to match
their brawn and brain against their op-
ponents. And where will the almost 600
remaining men be? They are expected to be
on the bleachers, giving their best in lusty
yells, And it is thought that most of them
will be there. |

“What do you think we will do with |
Elon?” is asked among the students frequent-
ly. Then someone chimes in, “I hope we
win by a large score—at least more than
14 to 0, as we did last year.” Maybe when
the one who cries for a big score thinks a
second time he will see the bad psychology
therein. If the score should be a large one
in our favor, the public would be expecting
the Wildcats to go through the season like
a tornado.

If, on the other hand, the difference be-
tween the two ends is small, the public will
wonder if Davidson has anything like a
team up here. Maybe they thought last
year that the “thin red line’ would crumble
under the onslaught of far heavier opponents.
They had the privilege of changing their
opinion. To keep the score down, we think,
is the best policy.

Elon lost almost her entire line, according
to reports in the paper. Other reports, less
authentic, say that she will have a better
team than last year. They will scrap, no
matter what the true status of their team
may be.

Some of the students seem to think that
Davidson will have a better team than that
of last season. Some think that it will be
about the same. Some think it will not be
as good. And finally, some don’t think at all.

PREVIOUS ENROLLMENT

(Continued from page 1)

The class of ’27 has taken the biggest
slump this year as regards numerical strength
and is the smallest class on the hill. Out of
the 160 members which it boasted last year
only 76 have been signed up on the files of
the registrar. As one is a co-ed, the number
left in the ranks is only 75. This is a de-
cided contrast to that of the class of ’26 last
year, which had a total of 118 registered.

This session’s Senior class outnumbers its
predecessor by five.
93 members enrolled as compared with the
88 who enrolled last fall as candidates for
the diploma. Only one student has been reg-
istered for post-graduate work up to the
present time.

to the fact that the squad is smaller and that
last year’s class contained an unusual amount
of good material.

Coach Mattox has started work with a
rush, showing plainly that he will make the
best out of whatever material he may have.
At this early date he has been unable to get
a line on any of the men personally, as only
two practices have been held. However, he
states that a number of the men have been
showing up well.

A few of the candidates were captains of |e.

Homegreen, of San Antonia Academy, and |

Covington, Myers, Black, McConnell, and |
Lindberg seem to be aboye the average also. |

with the leading fresh teams of North and

The records made by both the varsity and
freshmen last year were good ones. The |
varsity won seven, lost one and tied two, her
goal line being crossed but three times. The
Wildkittens won six and lost but one—the
last one, to Furman freshmen, from which
