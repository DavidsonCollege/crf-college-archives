ABBREVIATED EDITION

The entire staff of THE
DAVIDSONIAN sincerely re-
grets the necessity of limiting
the Midwinters edition to four
pages. This action is the re-
sult of a request by our printer
who desired to finish the work
on THE DAVIDSONIAN as
soon as possible so that he
might devote the remainder of
the week to the installation of
a printing press in his shop.
When this press is installed we
will be able to print the paper
in Davidson, and as a result,
can supply the student body
with more accurate and up to
date accounts of all campus
activities.
