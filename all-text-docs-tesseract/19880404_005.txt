Rusk Scholars

“America is fun, Assan funky, and d generally quite ariot”

By MARIA DOUGLAS

Springtime at Davidson
College is characterized by
singing birds, bathers at the
lake campus and the Rusk
Scholars. For the eleventh
year, three men and three
women from St. Pauls’
School in London have taken
part of their year off between
high school and college to
attend Davidson.

The. six of them—James
Harding, Thomas Marsden,
Michael Helfgott, Isabel
deMay, Rachael Shaw and
Victoria Fathers—recently
sat around a table in the Union
cafe eating popcorn,
“sweeties” (candy) and
smoking “fags” (cigarettes),
discussing just what brought
them here, what they liked
about Davidson and what
they found bizarre.

The opportunity to come to
America and go to. school
topped the list for most of
them.

“IT wanted to go to America.
I knew it would be fun, inter-
esting, funky and generally
quite a riot,” said Harding.
For Fathers, doing “arty
things” appealed to her. She
had been studying engineer-

ing since she was 15 and felt |.
“agreed they liked the size of Davidson

she needed a changé before
getting back into her major.
Marsden lived in Russia for
two years and had never been
to America. He wanted the
experience of living in both
Super Power countries. So
far, Marsden has found that

“the way they live and view things is
very similar.” The people there [in
the Soviet Union] are very open and
friendly, much like the Americans
are, he said.

The scholars find Davidson the seat
of friendliness. They marvel at how
gregarous and outgoing Davidson
Students ares Besides the people, most

and its location in the southern United
States.

Coming to Davidson meant to her,
as well as the others, learning yet
relaxing, not being stressed, a chance
to meet people in a structured envi-
ronment and most of all, having fun.

The scholars’ experience hasn’t
been without confrontations with the
unfamiliar or bizarre. All agreed that
alcohol and its importance is the most
strange.

According to them, people ion not
drink as much in England. The drink-
ing age is 18, which may account for

_the lack of interest in drinking. The
beer here has not changed Harding’ s-

habits: “I’m not impressed by the
beer,” he said.

Also of the Davidson social life,
the scholars have noticed that people
are Classed by their fraternity. Har-
ding described the fraternity scene
“very freaky.”

Shaw found it strange that tel
n

cans think nothing of driving’ lo

two weeks since I’ve been here,” she

- said.

“I’m amazed at the popularity of
basketball,” admitted Helfgott.
Added deMay, “The language is
strange. And they [students] are all
ebséssed with grades.” * :

Perhaps the most bizarre observa-
tion was made by Shaw.

“Cow-tipping is the most bizarre
thing I’ve heard of,” said Shaw as she
laughed hysterically. This activity
involves sneaking up on a sleeping
cow and tipping it over.

On a more serious note,
Helfgott observed that the
atmosphere on campus is “a
lot less political.” Accord-
ing to him, in England one is
considered trendy if one is
Strongly opinionated--radi-
cal, in fact.

Finally, what's consid-
ered to be “cool” in England
isa farcry from what Ameri-
cans consider “cool.” Ac-
cording to the experts on
cool and trendy, Harding
and Marsden, Americans
consider it cool if you are
sporty and know everyone.

Not so in England. “To be
cool, you must smoke, be
streetwise, hit clubs, listen
to trendy music, wear fash-
ionable clothes and be
aloof,” said Harding and
Marsden.

Trendy . music includes
Eric B. and Rakim, anything

.. funk, soul and Motown.

During their stay, the
Scholars will take two

©. classes and attend a series of
distances. “I’ve been to Florida in the

lectures developed by Paula
Moore, the Assistant Dean
of Students. The series is
entitled “A View From a
Window in America.”

Various Davidson profes-
sors and townspeople will
lecture on aspects of Ameri-
can life to the Rusk Scholars
as wellas to the international
students.

A Tea and Crumpets wel-
coming party for the schol-
ars was held March 30 at 4
p.m. in Vail Commons.

Answers

I. (f) Pain, itching, lesions, fever, muscu-
lar aches and headaches are all symptoms
associated with initial outbreak of the dis-
ease. Not everyone who has genital herpes
experiences all of these symptoms.

Recurrences are usually less severe and
rarely involve the flu-like symptoms, e.g.:
muscular aches and fever, of an initial
outbreak.

2. (d) The incubation period varies
greatly from one individual to another.
Usually, the first outbreak occurs within
three weeks after sexual contact with an
infected and contagious partner. However,
in some cases, it can take as long as three
years before symptoms appear.

3. (b) The average herpes patient will ex-
perience a recurrence three or four times a
year. But here, too, there is a great deal of
individual variation. Some people, appar-
ently, never have a second outbreak, while

others have recurrences so frequently that
‘they may think of their herpes lesions as a

chronic condition.
4. (b) Testing by a physician is the only

- way to get an accurate diagnosis of genital

herpes. Seif examination is the way most
people come to suspect they have the dis-
ease; however, there is a possibility that
they may mistake some other skin condi-
tion for herpes lesions. Herpes lesions will
eventually disappear on their own but the
herpes virus remains in the body, dormant
until something triggers a new outbreak.
Physicians have reliable laboratory tests
that can determine if the condition i is indeed
genital herpes.

5. (b) Genital herpes is treatable, al-

though not curable. There is a prescription
drug available called Zovirax (acyclovir).
A doctor can advise on the role of this drug
in the treatment of genital herpes as well as
offer self-help measures and counseling to
help control the disease.
- 6. (e) There is some indication that hav-
ing herpes might predispose a woman to de-
veloping cervical cancer. Fortunately,
cancer of the cervix is easily detected in its
very early stages by a pap smear. It is rec-
ommended that women with genital herpes
have a pap smear every six months.

Additionally, if active lesions are present
in the birth canal at the time of birth, the
newborn may become seriously ill. If you
have herpes, it is important to notify your
obstetrician so that you may be monitored
during the final stages of pregnancy.
