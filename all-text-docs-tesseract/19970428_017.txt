Kruse’s Cubby
Year-end
musings

By MICHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

Fact: Golfer Fuzzy Zoeller said this
about Tiger Woods: “Tell that little boy
not to serve fried chicken next year...
or collard greens, or whatever the hell
they serve.”

Opinion: The media did not portray
Fuzzy Zoeller as a racist bastard. Fuzzy
Zoeller portrayed Fuzzy Zoeller as a
racist bastard.

Fact: The Hornets are down 2-0 in their
best-of-five first round series with the
rough-and-tumble (or maybe just plain
rough) Knicks, which resumes tonight
at the Charlotte Coliseum.

Opinion: In the midst of all their child-
ish trash-talking and lip-smacking rev-
elry, the Knickerbockers are forgetting
one thing.

They play in the Eastern Confer-
ence and so do the Bulls and therefore
play for the opportunity to lose to the
Bulls. It’s really very anticlimactic.
But then again, so is the NBA.

Fact: A team - some team - will win the
Western Conference. We know this.

Opinion: Said team will lose to Jordan
and those aforementioned Bulls in the
Finals. (Although some would say this
is not an opinion at all, but a hard fact.

Fact: 5,076 people watched the Pan-
thers practice Saturday afternoon at
Ericsson Stadium.

Opinion: 5,076 people are in dire need
of (a) something to do, and (b) a life.

Fact: Ken Griffey Jr., who had 13 home
runs in 23 games going into Saturday’s
action, is on pace to hit 92 homers.

Opinion: Pundits and prognosticators
have long assumed that the hardest part
about a potential run at Maris’ record of
61 single-season dingers would be han-
dling the swarm of media late in the
season.

But the way Junior is losing base-
balls so far this spring, that “late in the
season” bit could become null and void.

Fact: The Observer sends Tom Sorensen
all over God’s green earth to comment
on athletic events.

Opinion: Whether the dateline reads
New York or Tuscon, Boise or
Timbuktu, Sorensen continually pro-
vides sample after sample from which
budding journalists can learn how not
to write.

Fact: With the academic year coming
to areluctant close, we - the students of
Davidson College - now enter the world
of optional class days and self-sched-
uled exams.

Opinion: The optional class days are
about as optional as breathing and the
self-scheduled exams are anything but.

If they were truly self-scheduled,
we would be taking them mid-morning
in our rooms and over a late-night bite
at Denny’s.

Or at least we could if we wanted
to. Hence, they’d be self-scheduled.

Fact: I’m going to be Editor-in-Chief
of this paper next year.

Opinion: I know, [ think it’s funny too,

Until August, then, I bid farewell.

Women’s tennis looks to build on 4th-place finish

By Jay CANTRELL
Staff Writer

Going into “this season,
women’s tennis coach Caroline
Price knew that the Southern Con-
ference title would be up for grabs.

But last weekend in Greenville,
S.C., the Wildcats couldn’t quite
capture it, finishing fourth in the
flighted tournament.

“T told them that this was the
most depth and parity we had ever

seen in the Southern Conference for
women,” Price said.

Marshall, Furman, Tennessee-
Chattanooga, Georgia Southern, and
Davidson all had legitimate shots at
the title. During the regular season,
Price’s team played close with each
of those school except Chattanooga,
a match they lost 7-0.

“We just wadded that up and
threw it out the window,” she said
of the atypical performance.

The three other duals ended 4-

3, with Davidson beating only GSU.
“It was a solid season,” Price
continued, “But not satisfying. We
fell just short in the 4-3 matches.”
The Wildcats entered the tour-
nament led by the play of last year’s
Freshman-of-the-Y ear and all-con-
ference performer Dana Casner.
“We had a good chance going
in,” she said. “There were four or
five teams that were really close.”
Ironically, Casner lost in the
semifinals to this year’s top rookie,

Karolina Glocwska of Chattanooga.

Casner finished third in the No.
1 singles with a 6-3, 7-5 victory
over Marshall’s Courtney Hague.
In doubles, Casner and partner
Amber Bradford also earned a
bronze. After being down 5-2, they
rallied to defeat Marshall’s top team
8-6.

“We had a lot of energy on the
court,” said Bradford. “It was a good

Maybe the baseball team was
inawe of Riley Park in Charleston,
S.C., the top-
of-the-line
facility that
was com-
pleted just in time for this
weekend’s double-elimination
Southern Conference tournament.

“Tt was definitely one of the
nicest parks I’ve ever played in,”
said Luke Goodwin. “Icould prob-
ably speak for the rest of the team
on that too.”

Or maybe it was just the fact

- | that sixth-seeded Davidson entered

the event losers of its last six.

Whatever the reason though,
the boys of summer made an early
exit in the Lowcountry, losing
Thursday to The Citadel 18-8, and
Friday to Appalachian St. 7-5.

“It’s real frustrating to have it
end this
way,” said
rightfielder —

Gesu. +s

Quattlebaum, who has starred vir-
tually throughout his four-year
Davidson career. “We have no
excuses.

“We hit the ball well through-
out the tournament, but we needed
some timely hits that we didn’t
get.”

But getting hits was really not
the problem Thursday night against
the No. 3 Bulldogs.

Six Wildcats — Ben Brown,
Brad Edwards, Jeff Coker, Mike

.|DeSimone, Anderson Marvin, and

Brian Joyce — contributed two
hits apiece, as Davidson mounted a

13-hit attack and tied a single-game
tourney record with three triples.

Down 4-2, the Wildcats
stunned the 2,459 Citadel faithful
by tallying three runs in the top of
the fifth on RBI singles by
Quattlebaum and Coker.

The Citadel then bounced back
with a six-spot in the bottom of the
inning, taking a commanding 10-5
lead.

But Davidson manufactured
three runs on three hits and a pair of
Bulldog errors in the seventh, nar-
rowing the margin to 10-8.

It was all Citadel from there
though, as the heavy-hitting Bull-
dogs — who totaled 20 hits —
notched four more runs in both the

seventh and the eighth to register _

the blowout victory.

Davidson starter Jonathan
Coulombe, who has been a work-
horse for the squad all season, bore
the brunt of The Citadel’s assault,
allowing 10 runs on 11 hits in 4 1/3
innings.

“He and Mort (Mordecai Stolk)

have been logging a lot of innings © :

for the past three or even four years,”
Quattlebaum noted. “That may have
something to do with their not hav-
ing as strong a performance late in
the season.”

“Jon threw pretty well,” said
Joyce, who went a combined 5-for-
: 8 with two

triples in the
tournament.
“They’ve just
got solid hitters.
Our bats were
there and their
bats were there.
They just won
out in the long run.”

damage enoughearly, scoring three
runs in both the first and fourth on
their way to a 7-3 advantage.

The Wildcats countered with
tworuns in the bottom of the sixth,
but could never quite get over the
hump, and Appalachian held on
for its 10th straight victory over
Davidson and fourth in the last
week.

“App. doesn’t have over-
whelming pitching, but they have
a few guys who can hit their spots

Men’s hoops secures shot at national champs

By MICHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

To be the best, you’ve got to
play the best. And the men’s bas-
ketball team has put itself in a posi-
tion to do just that.

Coach Bob McKillop con-
firmed Friday that the Wildcats are
one of four teams scheduled to play
at the Fiesta Bow] Classic Dec. 28
and 30 at the 14,428-seat McKale
Center in Tuscon, Ariz.

Davidson is unofficially slated
to play Kansas St. in the opening
round and either James Madison or.
defending national champion Ari-
zona in the second.

Arizona, a four-seed in last
month’s NCAA tournament,
knocked off three No. 1 seeds -
Kansas, North Carolina, and Ken-
tucky, incidentally the three
winningest
schools in the
history of col-
lege basketball -

on its way to the

title.

The ‘Cats return virtually their
entire roster next year.

“We want to play the biggest
teams possible,” said shooting guard
Mark Donnelly, whose cousin
playedon Arizona’s 1994 Final Four
squad.

“This is what we want to do,”
said center Chadd Holmes. “It’s
what you dream about as a kid,
playing the big schools in front of
big crowds.”

And the Wildcats will definitely
get that opportunity next season,
whether it comes in the desert or
not.

In addition to the Fiesta Bowl
tourney, Davidson is set to battle
Wake Forest Dec. 3 and UMass Jan.
22 here in Belk, and UNC Charlotte
Dec. 10 at two-year-old Halton
Arenaand Southern Methodist Dec.
20 in Dallas.

“We have the same big teams
again,” said scoring extraordinaire

‘MVP Miles

David Burns, “and I think we’ Il fare

. better against them next season.”

Added Donnelly: “Now UMass
and Wake have to come back to our
place and we’ll be a year better.”

Final Four

Simon scans

The
Wildcats
and the
Wildcats
might clash
in Tucson
next year.
