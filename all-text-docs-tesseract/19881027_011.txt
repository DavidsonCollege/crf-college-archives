Volleyball wins stunning victory over -UNCC

By MARY FAITH MOUNT

Volleyball coach Rebecca Hawkins can
scarcely believe her team’s performance.
“Unbelievable, not unbelievable... incred-
ible!” she says, reflecting the general mood
after last Thursday’s win over county rival
UNC-Charlotte in Johnston Gym last
Thursday. ,

Davidson again employed enthusiasm
and skill to hold tight and defeat the Forty-
niners, 15-13, 16-14, 8-15, 3-15, 15-13.

Hawkins was quick to mark this victory
as “the biggest win Davidson has ever
had.”

ball coach, Hawkins has much to praise in
her team. .

UNCC is a member of the Sunbelt Con-
ference, which includes Jacksonville,
Western Kentucky and Virginia Common-
wealth, among others. Before the game, the
UNCC coach informed Hawkins that this
was her best team at the school.

The first two games were very intense
and close throughout with Davidson
emerging as the victor of both.

After these two close victories, the Wild-
cats seemed to show their mental and
physical fatigue, dropping the next two

But the team rallied, as the crowd helped

restore the previous enthusiasm. Inspired _

by the play of Mimi Plauche, Davidson
won the fifth and deciding game.

Hawkins commended the crowd for the
boisterous support. The crowd seems to
raise the intensity of the team, she believes,
and she wants the team to maintain that
level of intensity.

Although this win was most definitely a
true team effort, the crucial player was
Plauche. She had 19 kills and 44 attempts
for a hitting average of .385.

Hawkins said the only way UNCC could

-have beaten Davidson was to shut down

Plauche, and Thursday night she could not
be stopped.

Hawkins commended three other players
for their all-around play. Ellen Ott’s defen-
sive game was a plus for Davidson. She
also added extra punch to the Wildcat at-
tack.

Molly Graver again played consistently,
as did Holt Hathaway, who suffered nag-
ging back pains.

The team travels to Limestone College
on Wednesday, then UNC-Greensboro on

Wildcats top Sewanee

Last week the Davidson field
hockey team upped its record to 5-
8-1 with a 3-1 win Saturday over
the University of the South.

The Cats first goal by Suzanne
Mauze was called back due to an
- offsides penalty but five minutes
later, Mary Russ knocked one in
from outside the penalty circle--a
goal that! was difficult to stop for
the Sewanee goalkeeper. _

Davidson continued its good
offensive pressure throughout the
first half, and with four minutes
remaining, Marta Bukowski
scored from the left side amidst a
scuffle around the goal giving

Davidson a 2-0 halftime advan-

Wildcats have tough Virginia trip

By WHIT WILKS

Davidson travelled to Virginia last weekend for a
pair of games against Liberty University and James
Madison University. The Cats were surprised by
Liberty 5-1 and fell to a solid J.M.U. squad 1-0.

In the process, Davidson’s record fell to 7-10-2
heading into last evening’s contest at Appalachian
State.

On Friday, the Cats continued a season-long trend
and fell behind in the first half. The Flames opened
the scoring roughly twenty minutes into the match to
go up 1-0.

Davidson soon responded, however, as Peter
Cobb scored the equalizer only. moments later. The
teams went into the half tied at one.

Unfortunately, the second half was reminiscent of
the Belmont Abbey game. Liberty scored only sec-
onds into stanza to take a 2-1 lead. From there the

situation only worsened, as The Flames added three
more scores in registering the 5-1 victory.

On Sunday, Davidson looked to get back on the
winning track as the team went to Harrisonburg to
play J.M.U. The Cats had an opportunity early, as
Neco DaSilva just missed only two minutes into the
first half.

The Dukes did not waste much time after this near
miss, however, as they scored: at the nine minute
mark to lead 1-0. —

Neither team could generate much offense the rest
of the first half, and J.M.U. clung to the 1-0 advan-
tage.

The second half saw a continuation of the offen-
sive void. J.M.U. managed to blank the Cats for the
remainder of the match and won by the 1-0 margin.

Davidson plays at home this Sunday against Wake
Forest University.

Dodgers and Athletics continue

baseball’s great fall traditions

By HAP BRYANT
The World Series, that ever-

present rite of fall, has graced us .

with its presence once again.

It seems like only yesterday
that the Yankee Stadium crowd
was chanting, “REG-GIE, REG-
GIE,” for the three home-run per-
formance of their star and future
candy bar. In fact, that was eleven
fall classics ago, and a new “Mr.
October” has yet to emerge. —

However, the 1988 World Se-

ries will go down in the memory

banks as a great one in its own

right, for seldom have we seen

such drama, such fortitude, and
such enthusiasm. —_

The Dodgers, following the
underdog tradition of the Twins
and Royals of recent years,
seemed grossly outmanned by the
huge Monster Bash Bunch from
up the California coast.

Even the first game was a land-
mark. The first-inning home run
by Mickey Hatcher, perhaps the
most unlike! of all, set the
stage for the heroic struggle of
desire vs. ability, of intensity vs.
apathy.

“Jose Canseco’s mammoth

grand slam in the fourth inning
turned the tide, but the Dodgers
held on.

Trailing 4-3 in the last of the
ninth, Dodger manager Tommy
Lasorda called on his crippled
superstar, Kirk Gibson. With one
man on base, Gibson came to the
plate to face the Athletics’ bull-
pen ace, Dennis Eckersley.

Gibson looked sick on the first
several pitches, fouling four off

“and limping away from the plate.

Reflections on the Series

._ By JOHN MAHERAS

One of the biggest shocks in baseball history
occurred during this year’ s World Series. One of the
most powerful run-producinhg clubs ever assembled,
the Oakland Athletics, with the likes of Jose Canseco
and Mark McGwire, were défeated handily in five
games by a team, who at the beginning of the season
was picked to finish third in their division: the Los
Angeles Dodgers.

The Dodgers captured the momentum in the
World Series after the climactic finish to Game 1.
After falling behind to the A’s 4-2 due to Jose
Canseco’s grand slam, the Dodgers’ hope for a.
victory quickly diminished. —

But the Dodgers managed to manufacture a run in
the latter part of the game to cut the A’s lead to 4-3.
The score remained the same going into the bottom.
of the ninth. —

The A’s had their Seen Dennis Eckersley, °
on the mound to try to finish off the game. The first
two Dodger batters grounded and popped out.

Then Mike Davis came up to bat and managed to
get on by a walk. Suddenly, Kirk Gibson, who was

doubtful to play in the World Series due to an injury

sustained in Game 6 with the Mets, limped to the
