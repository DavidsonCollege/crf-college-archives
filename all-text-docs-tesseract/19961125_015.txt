best at Nike Invitational

By WILL BrapsHAW
Sports Editor.

Men’s basketball is not the
only squad to run into top ten com-
petition early this season. Eigh-
teen swimmers traveled tothe Nike
Cup Invitational in Chapel Hill on
Wednesday, facing off against
some of the nation’s elite programs.

“We went to a meet with
NCAA level champions and high-
powered Division I programs, and
it was a great showing,” head coach
Rich DeSelm said. “It was great
competition, and a great pool. Our
team had a chance to see the high-
est level of swimming in the coun-

“T’mreally proud of the group,
to come away rewriting the season
best times list and having a lot of
people break into the all-time top
ten. It’s really exciting to get faster

swims before the last dual meet of
the semester (against Georgia
Southern and Eastern Carolina on
Dec..7 at Cannon pool).”

On the women’s side, North
Carolina won with 1120.50 points,
and Kentucky finished second
(1037). According to DeSelm,
Carolina should be a top ten team,
and Kentucky should boast sev-
eral All-American swimmers. The
Wildcats finished tenth (40) , beat-
ing William & Mary (16).

Maty Shell Brosche high-
lighted the women’s performance,
setting school records in the 200
back (2:08.24, 17th) and 400 Indi-
vidual Medley (4:34.38, 11th). She
also grabbed 14th in the 200 IM
(2:10.25), 23rd in the 100 back
(1:02.21), swam the anchor for the
200 free relay (1:43.17, 16th) and
400 medley relay (409.00, 16th),
led off the 800 free relay (8:02.87,

medley relay (155.30, 17th).

“T was really excited. [usually
don’t swim fast unshaved and
unrested, but this year I’ve done
well,” Brosche said. “It could be
better, but I’m happy with what
I’m doing now, and I hope it will
get better.”

Other top Wildcats were
Kathleen Paffenroth and Zannah
Bozzone. Paffenroth grabbed 16th
inthe 200 fly (2:11.36), 22nd in the

Tennessee won the men’s
meet (977) with North Carolina
taking second (835), and Davidson
grabbed eleventh (5) avenging an
early season loss to Virginia Tech
(4). DeSelm said the Volunteers
should vie for the national title,
while both UNC and Florida (3rd
place, 600) should be among the
nation’s top ten or fifteen teams.

Freddy Schnell scored the only
individual points for the Wildcats
in the 200 back (1:56.25, 20th),

_and he swam the front leg of the
400 free relay (3: 15.21, 15th). The —

Wildcats trailed Virginia Tech

heading into that final relay, but

Schnell, Dave Maddux, Scott

Harper, and Keith Nelson vaulted ©

Davidson over the Hokies.

“We didn’t even know we had
beaten them (Virginia Tech) until
after the meet was over,” Harper

’ said. “That was cool, but it was not

our main goal. We wanted to swim
well and watch some great swim-
ming, and we did that. It was a
positive meet.”

Wrestling begins
season at App. St.

By Drew WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

While most freshmen this se-
mester are feeling the rotund ef-

_ fects of “freshmen 15,” five new

wrestlers are learning to combat
the cheeseburgers and fries served
by the Commons.

The five rookies and two oth-

‘ers traveled to App. St. this week-

end for a preseason tourney.
“It’s probably one of the
toughest tournaments we will go

‘'to this year,” said Coach Oddo.

Ian Cambell placed fourth out
of 30 competitors in the 150-Ib.
division. Oddo also praised the
efforts of Miles Cox and Stuart
Frye, who both won matches in the
tourney. .

Coach Oddo is expecting big
things from Ben Wall, Seth
Herman, Andy Sterling, and cap-
tain George Escaravage.

“George is three times the
wrestler he was last season,” said
Coach Oddo, “As long as we stay
healthy and avoid injury, we should
do well.”
