ANNUAL MEETING OF
BOARD OF TRUSTEES
IS HELD HERE TODAY

PETITION FOR DANCES
IS SUBMITTED TODAY

Another petition for dancing
on the Davidson College cam-
pus was presented to the trus-
tees for their consideration at
their annual meeting Wednesday,
February 19.

The petition reads as follows:
To the Board of Trustees:

In view of the fact that the
dances given by Davidson stu
dents this year have been con-
ducted in a most
and decorous manner, which fact

respectable

we consider proof that Davidson
dances CAN be.so conducted re-
gardless of the place where they
take place; we respectfully re-
quest that the board consider al-
lowing dances to be presented on
the campus at the earliest time
which it deems possible.

Respectfully submitted,

When interviewed on a criti

open, Mr. F. L. Jackson, treas-
urer of the College, made the
following-reply :

The Business Office of the Col
lege is run solely as a service unit
of the institution, Its one purpose
for existence is to serve and make
more effective the other divisions
of the College work.

The bookstore is operated for the
convenience of the students. It 1

too many books are not left on our
vands, a small profit is made, Such
profit, if made, has for a quarter
of a century gone into the student
loan fund. Several hundred boys
have been helped through college
in this manner,

We might keep the store open
all day, or any part of the day the
students might like This would
necessitate adding to the cost of
the text books. The College Busi

ness Officer’s Association, however,
feels that the text books
are already too high and is doing

everything possible in a co-opera-

tive way to get the prices reduced.
It would be possible also to employ
clerks to keep the store open for
longer periods, but this would
either add to the cost of the books,
or necessitate adding a line of eats,
drinks, novelties, etc., which would
be in direct competition to the stu-
dent store.

Suggestions for the improvement
of the of any part of the
Business Office are always solicited,
considered, and appreciated.

If some other hour would be
more convenient for a majority of
the students, we would Uke for it

MERITS OF FRESHMAN
FRANCHISE...

In recent issues of The David
sonian, there have been opinions ex
pressed concerning the question of
Freshman voting. There can be no
doubt that the question is one
which warrants the, earnest consid
eration opi evefy member of the
student body. To the man who is
seriously and_ sincerely interested
in the general well-being of Dav-
idson, there is nothing of more im-
portance than the revision of some

of our freshman rules and regula-

tions,

the last freshman class allowed to
vote. The vote was taken away on
the grounds that freshmen were
most easily influenced ofa mem-
bers of the student body, and that
they knew the nominees less than
any other members. The first point
is difficult to gainsay, though it
seems as if a mountain were made
out of a mole-hill in regard to it.
The second point can not only be
questioned, but actually refuted.
We of the upper classes are prone
to consider that the freshmen do
not know us, simply because we do
not know them. If we are able to
go back, in memory, to ‘our fresh-
man year, we will find that we
knew far more upper classmen than
we might at first think, It is an
established fact that one knows

For the reheving of the situation
alluded to above, a plan has been
worked out which entitles each
freshman to a half-vote. Thus, one
upper classman vote would equal
two freshman votes. This feature

would climinate practically all dan-

vide that each freshman ballot be
so marked when printed, so that
there could be no possibility that
freshman votes would count more
than their prescribed value. In
this manner, the freshman class
would be re-incorporated into the
student body. It is unjust, and in
a sense, unconstitutional to segre-
gate any class, as the freshman
class is now segregated. It might
be added that since the placing of
this additional restriction on the
freshman class, the classes have

been more inclined to disregard or

disobey present regulations, and va-

rious demonstrations of so-called
“class spirit’ have been far more
obvious than formerly.
