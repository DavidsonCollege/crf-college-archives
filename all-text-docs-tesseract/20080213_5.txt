Charleton Heston moderated the
college’s first anti-gay panel.

Moderated by Chuck Norris and
Charleton Heston, Tuesday's
homophobic forum in the Union
900 Room proved to be one of the
most pleasantly cheuvanistic and
single-minded experiences in
recent memory. The homophobic
panel, the first in Davidson's histo-
ry, provided a unique opportunity
for rabid biggots and fascit pigs
alike to vent their loathing for those
who, as Heston delicately phrased
it, “putt from the rough.”

For the past four weeks, the resi-
| dents of Base Rich have suffered a
series of odious, distasteful pranks
in the dorm’s two bathrooms.

Junior Hall Counselor Timmy
Chang detailed the nature of the
foul practical jokes:

“Basically, some douchebag's
been laying his turds down on the
seat rather than in the bowl.” Each
of the dorm's 24 residents admitted
to having witnessed at least one of
the fecal gifts.

THE YOWL

Your Davidsonian Honor Section

Once a safe place to relieve one-

self, the Base Rich bathroom has
fallen victim to unsightly dumps.

“IT mean you can tell it's just one
guy,” Tyler Roberts explained. “All
the dumps have a similar length,
girth, consistency, texture and
taste. At least the dude's got a reg-
ular cycle.”

Today, that “douchebag” has
been identified as freshman Parker
McStone, who lives two floors
above on 2nd Rich.

Homophobic Forum a

Good Ole Time

Heston began the discussion by
quoting Leviticus 20:13: “If a man
lies with a man as one lies with a
woman, both of them have done
what is detestable. They must be
put to death; their blood will be on
their own heads.” Everyone on
hand agreed on the aptness of the
verse and its applicability to 21st
century America.

After a few minutes of earnest
discussion about the detriment of
gays to the military, the institution
of marriage, the economy and the
o-zone layer, the discussion lapsed
into recollections from panelists’
favorite episodes of “Straight Eye
for the Gay Guy,” fishing stories, a
crammed viewing of the boot-
legged Paris Hilton sex tape on
Norris's laptop and a heated argu-
ment about whether or not
Refrigerator Perry could have
eaten 50 hard-boiled eggs. “I think
today was an important step
towards eliminating diversity,” said
Mark Wampler ‘08. “Hopefully
such discussions will foster a better
campus understanding of the dan-
gers of progressive thinking.”

spotted the culprit leaving the base-
ment's south bathroom at 2:42 yes-
terday afternoon.

Pritchett claims McStone looked
suspiciously up and down the hall-
way before scurrying out the door
and up the stairs. ,

Pritchett then entered the bath-
room and found the smoking gun, a
steamy deuce plopped directly on
the center stall's porcelain seat.

“Tt stunk pretty bad, but what
really struck me was its size,” the
shocked Pritchett told us. “I'd say
it wrapped three quarters of the
way around the seat. Not bad aim,
actually.”

The Base Rich hall counselors
have said they don't plan to pursue
legal action against McStone;
they're just happy the whole thing
is over.

“We gave him a pretty good talk-
ing-to,” Chang said. “Hopefully
he'll be leaving his dumps where
they belong, up there on 2nd Rich.”

Asked why he chose Base Rich
as the target of his rogue defecation
operation, the mostly mum and
mysterious McStone replied,
take most of my dumps within
minutes of eating at Commons.
Why would I walk all the way up
the stairs to 2nd when I could just
as easily lay ‘em down here?”

Amy Winehouse Busted

THE DAVIDSONIAN. 5

F.. The Davidsonian

Trying to Cross Border in
Trunk of Kanye’s Hummer

sree

This jail-bound toothless wench
had plenty to be wistful about.

British singer Amy Winehouse
was discovered last weekend while
attempting to cross the United
States border en route to the 2008
Grammy Awards. Denied a visa
earlier this month, Ms. Winehouse
was discovered in the trunk of fel-
low Grammy nominee Kanye
West's yellow Hummer.

Currently residing in England,
Ms. Winehouse was unable to
obtain a visa to attend the ceremo-
ny, which was held Friday in LA.

Mr. West's yellow Hummer, was
first spotted at a popular vacation

Michael Vick in prison.

spot for the stars just south of the
United States border patrol station
in California.

The hummer, which was recog-
nized because of the vanity plate
“FIZIKS,” was confiscated by the
local police and has yet to be
returned, although the police did
escort Mr. West to the ceremony,
where he accepted four Grammys.

Ms. Winehouse, however, was
not as lucky and was detained. She
received her five Grammys via
satellite, and was returned quickly
to rehab, that toothless vixen.

Hammered Trebek Ditches
Davidson Jeopardy

Alex Trebek chose the Korner Pub over Jeopardy: Davidson Style

Following an atrocious debut for
Jeopardy: Davidson Style, matters
did not improve much in the sec-
ond installment.

Minutes before the cameras
rolled, scheduled host celebrity
host Alex Trebek was no where to
be found.

According to several eye-wit-
nesses, Trebek stumbled through
the Union’s first floor doors at 8:45
p.m. He was sweating profusely,
he reeked of bourbon, and his tie
was tied around his head.

Trebek immediately spotted the
Union Board’s ever-so-cute tempo-
rary ice-skating rink. With the

refined grace of a veteran game-
show host, he hurdled the wall and
glided across the ice on his chest.

Trebek, screaming obscenities,
tackled several faculty children and
freshmen couples holding hands.

After several minutes of utter
mayhem, which culminated in
Trebek pissing himself as he was
dragged off the ice by Police Chief
Faucet Runner, the show upstairs
finally started.

Trebek could not be reached for
comment, but his agent notified us
that he had spent several hours at
the Korner Pub, where he chal-
lenged several regulars to darts.
