Baker Arena brings
new ticket policy

Students must get tickets in advance

By JOHN BURNS

The ticket policy for the
1989-90 basketball-geason and.
beyond was recently released,
outlining the seats available to
students, faculty and staff.
Reactions to the policy have
been mixed at: best, and many
people have harsh criticism for
the plan. Some students. say
they feel they are being
shunted aside to make room
for wealthy contributors who
may not even attend most of
the games. ©

Shawn O’Rourke and
Sandy Smith, managers in the
ticket office, argued that this
was not the case. “We're trying
to be fair to everyone in-
volved,” said O’Rourke. “The
students and the season oot
holders all need to be t
fairly.” There are going t
of changes for everyone be-
cause of the new building.”

' Smith, who is beginning
his first year at Davidsonaftera
stint at Virginia Tech, showed
his frustration by saying, “No
matter how hard we try to
appease people, you're going
to piss someone off. Everyone
wants a front row seat.”

Under the new policy, stu-
dents must pick up tickets at
the ticket office the day before
all home games between 7:30
a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Students are
given seats ona first come, first
serve basis in the designated
Ean section. .

’ The design of the seats in

@ new Baker Arena prevents
open admission, the seating
method used in JohnstonGym,
because every section is di-
vided into individual seats.

- “We have 1,324 lower level
chairback seats and 2,200 ‘bum
seats’ on each side in the
bleachers,” said O’Rourke.
“That means we sell over 6,000
individual seats. We can’t have
people sitting anywhere they
want to.” ~

Students are seated in
' what amounts to half of the
lower level sid facing the

home bench. This gives stu-
dents 340 seats on the lower

level. Smith pointed out that
that is more than any-othef
single group. “Remember,” hié
said, “there are only as mafiy
seats on the bottom level 48 we
had on one side of Johnston

Gym, and you guys get 340 of
them.”

This lower level section is”

for Davidsonstudents only. No
non-Davidson guests will be
allowed. “Wethought that was
only fair.” ike stated.

If students do not request
all of the 1,100 upper level seats
that are reserved by the dead-
line, the ticket office will begin
to sell them to the general pub-
lic. “But we will never sell the
bottom seats,” Smith said.

There are also large sec-
tions set aside for season ticket

bersand corporate sponsors, as
well as the visiting team’s fans
and the families of players and
coaches (according to NCAA
regulations). The public and
faculty and staff are left to split
one side section and both ends
behind the goals. Faculty and
staff who wish to use their
complementary tickets can
only sit in the upper level on
the far left. They may purchase
lower level seats for half price.

Smith stressed that no one
will be unhappy with the seats
on the upper level. “Don’t use
the term ‘nosebleed seats.’ I
hate that word! There are no
bad seats in this arena. It is a
beautiful building.”

When asked why students
couldn’ t just show their I.D.s at
the gate and receive a ticket
stub, O’Rourke pointed to
auditing procedures. “We
have to know how many seats

we fill with paying customers:

and how many we fill with
complementary tickets. When
you get your seat, we scratch
your name off the list until we
fill the section. We do this with
football and with games at the
Coliseum. It’s strictly an audit-
ing problem.”
