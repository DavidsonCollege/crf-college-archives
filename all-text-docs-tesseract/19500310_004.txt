date for the Y presidency, comman-
dant of the Duke defenses, and the
only man is the history of the
school to flunk out four room
mates is really just a simple Amer-
ican boy—according to his present
roomy “Jelly Belly” Kelly.

J. C. Evans was born in Char-
lotte and comes to us by way of
McCallie and through the grace ci
Chief LineBerry. “Slick” faces re-
tirement from student ‘activities
this spring With the hopes of going
into the cotton business with his
father which he says is merely a
front.

Following in the footsteos of
“Dum Dum" Ennet! and other it
lustrious Duke alumni, “Slick” has
carried on the trad‘tion by organiz-
ing the Evan's Marauders. These
are a small group of specially train-
ed soldiers under the leadership of
Lt. Henry Wilson and Sgt. “Joy”
Malloy.

This group maintaims strict dis-
cipline. Once when “Toy” messed
up in ‘ranks he. was handcuffed and
locked. up in a closet with a chicken
leg and a biscuit to stay for the
week end. He’ was sayed by a last
minute reprieve from .the com-
mandant. :

Kelly also has a record of ship-
ped roommates and they are-a well
suited pair. However Jelly says,
“Everything hé and I do is under-
cover,”

“Slick” has had a varied career.
Last year he was. leading in votes
for the “Y" presidency up until a

sudden shift in the last ballot. He

says this was because the boys
were saving an honest man for
treasurer,

Besides politics he claims an un-
defeated record in interfraterni.s
hand ball competition. In tennis he
says he is strictly a cash’ player
having recently taken a member of
the tennis team for $17.

At the present time “Slick” is
in training for his forthcoming duel
with Grover Lee to decide who gets
Kelly. Grover says he ain't trained
any yet but that he fully believes
that he can beat his patoose.

“Slick” wouldn't comment on his
recent fishing trip to Florida but
“Sandy: Rankin volunteered the
information. He said they started
for Florida on Wednesday and got
there Saturday, where they spent
several days enjoxing the sights
of the local junk yard. He added
that “Slick” drove a thousand miles
to catch one fish and had to throw
him back: because he was too little.

Since he did so well on that ques-
tion “Slick” referred me to “San-
dy” when I asked him about his
women. When he asked “Sandy”
what he was waiting for he said,
“I’m thinking of something nice te
say about your girls, but I can't.”
_As I was leaving the room a little’
squirt with a harmonica stuck his
head in the door and said, “Pop,
ain't it time for your evening brew
at the road house?”

In college days I must confess,

T've often heard it said:

“The biggest block to one's suc-
cess is usually one’s head.”

In Fayetteville, Arkansas, there is
always a friendly gathering of
University of Arkansas students at
the Student Union Building. And,
as in college campus haunts every-
where, ice-cold Coca-Cola helps
make these get-to-gethers something
to remember. As a refreshing pause
from the study grind, or on a Satur-
day-night date—Coke belongs.

Ask for it either way ... both

other trips are planned by AYH
local Councils throughout the U.

as $1.25 a day. :

These trips, Dr, Miller added,
now studying in American schools
to join their fellow students who,
since the war, have been traveling
at home and in Europe in unpre-
cedented numbers. He predicted
that twice as many students would
go on hosteling trips this summer
as in 1949,

Hosteling — inexpensive hik-
ing or cycling along established
routes with overnight stays in hos.
tels maintained by Local Councils
of interested citizens — has long
been a popular mode of travel for
young people abroad, and is at-
tracting many followers in this
country.

Trips sponsored by the AYH Na-
tional Headquarters will range in
length from five to ten weeks and
will start in late June and early
July. On these trips, hostelers wil.
travel in small mixed groups with
trained leaders. -Estimated costs
tange from $1)5 for some trips in
the United States to $780 for trips
to North Sea and Mediterranean
areas. In all cases costs cover the
entire trip from starting to finish-
ing points. For overseas trips this
means embarkation and debarka-
tion points.

In the United States, hosteling
groups will visit northern | New
England, the Great Lakes, Long
Istand Sound and the Colonial Vir-
ginia area. Of particular | interest
are the seyen-week National Parks-
High Sierras trip for hikers and
the Rolling Hostel trip, in which
specially equipped trains will take
hostelers cross Country, permitting
them to cycle in scenic areas, us-
ing the train as their Hostel each
night. Rolling Hostel trips will go
to the Grand Canyon and Yellow-
stone Park.

Trips planned for the North
American continent will take hos-
telers to the Canadian Rockies,
Gaspe Peninsula, Ontario, the
Maritime Provinces and the Sague-
nay River area, all in Canada, and
to Mexico, Guatemala and Alaska,

The trips to Europe will include
visits to the British Isles, Scandi-
navia, France, the North Sea area,
Central Europe, Western Europe,
the Mediterranean area and South-
west Europe. Trips involving work
projects will also be conducted in
Germany and Holland, Possession
of an AYH Pass, which costs $2.00
a year for those under 21 and $3.00
for those over, permits a hosteler
to remain overnight in any hostél
in this country or abroad at a
charge of not more than SOc.

Hosteling in the U. S. began in
1934 and has since spread from
coast to coast. At present there arc
AYH Local Councils in 29 States,
which supervise 160 hostels in such
parts of the country as the New
England coastal and mountain
areas, Long Island Saund, the
Great Lakes, Colonial Virginia and
the mountain regions of the West.

Hostel accommodations are lo-
cated in barns and farm buildings,
in cabins and private homes, and
are supervised by resident house-
parents. Each hostel provides sep-
arate sleeping quarters and wash-
rooms for young men and women,
a common kitchen where hostelers
may cook their meals and, in most
cases, recreational facilities. Hos-
telers .travel light, knowing thal
they will find clean blankets, clean
beds and cooking utensils at each
hostel,

John D. Rockefeller, 3rd, presi-
dent of American Youth Hostels,
believes that in addition to its rec-
reational value, hosteling is a fac-
tor in fostering international under-
standing. In a recent statement, he
said, “Hosteling provides unique
and sound opportunities for nor-
mal, friendly relations between the
peoples of different nations. It af-
fords practical experience in the im-

“Live Dangerously’;

Grinnell, la—(1.P.)— A chal-
lenge to college and university stu-
dents and their faculties to’ ‘think
and live dangerously” was issue
here recently by President Samuel
N. Stevens of Grinnell College:
President Stevens declaréd: “I“find
fault with the complacency which
seems to exist among-studénts and
faculty in most colleges and univer-
sities in the United States. Edyca-
tional institutions should be ‘dan.
gerous’ environments in which
young people live during the forma-
tive years of their lives.

“It is proper for young peoptc
to be radical, restless, and discon
tented with the status quo and ea-
ger to see great changes occurring
in a social structure. It is unnatural

portant business of getting along
with people of differing back-
grounds and points of view, Al-
ready twenty-six nations have youth
hostel organizations. Over a period
of years the many thousands of
young people returning each year
from visits to other countries will
make a basic contribution to inter-
national friendship and understand-
ing.”

will interest all students.

Muntz.

The Golden Warrior is an his-
torical novel which relates, as no
history could, the life of King Har-
old of England. It illumines what

ter of English history — the Nor-
man Conquest. At Hasting, iri the
year 1066, Harold’s great English
army was defeated by the Normans
under William the Conqueror, and
Harold himself lost his life — but
in that battle he won everlasting
fame and a permanent place in Eng-
lish hearts, Harold had sacrificed
much for the sake of the crown.
He had given up his beloved com-
mon-law wife, banished his own
brother from England, and became
a man almost without friends. The
lives of few fictional heroes can
match that of Harold, whose ex-
ceptional personal qualities charmed
even his arch-foe William and
won him the love of all England.

III. Chips Off the Old Benchley
——by Robert Benchley.

Chips Off the Qld Benchley
is a collection of material by
Benchley which has appeared in
various magazines and newspapers
beginning as far back as 1915, and
represents some of the most inspir-
ed writing the Old Master ever
did. Undaunted by problems and
phenomena that would phase any
ordinary -man, he courageously
tackles the future evolution of man
(tree or miammal?), puts forward
his own five year plan, elucidates
his new bone dust theory of hu-
man behavior, and finally plunges
straight into the mysteries of March
15. In short here js a collection to
delight, equally, both the sinful and
the pure in heart. -

IV. Little Squire Jim—Robert K.
Marshall,

Little Squire Jim is a story of
North Carolinian mountain folks
and particularly the story of the
boy James Braxton Boyden and a
Catholic mother. Left an orphan
Little Jim lives a lonely, secluded
life, emerges only to run into
trouble, and finally dies, “killed” as
his neighbors believe, in the fami.
ly tradition.

U. N. Chiet’s Statements
Urge Peace Negotiations

Lake Success, New York —Some

small conference room here at Unit-

That man is Trygve Lie, the 54-
