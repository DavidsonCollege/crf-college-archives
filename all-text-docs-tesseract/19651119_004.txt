THE DAVIDSONIAN

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1965

_ By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Davidson’s athletic depart-
ment and biology department
are the chief beneficiaries of
the recommendations made by
the Physical Plant Self-Study
Committee in the Self-Study Re-
port issued this week.

Major additions to Johnston
gymnasium and construction of
a campus golf course, a new
guest house, a new college
union, a limndlogical labora-
tory, and a greenhouse for the
biology department, are the ma-
jor recommendations of the
committee, in addition to en-
_dorsement of a new library,
an item which was left to the
Library Committee to explore
in detail.

The committee reiterated the
position previously taken by
THE DAVIDSONIAN and others
that an addition should be added
on the north side of Johnston
Gymnasium, which would in-
clude three more basketball
courts on the upper floor, sev-
eral handball courts on the lower
floor. and additional storage
space and locker facilities.

ATHLETIC ADDITIONS

The Physical Plant group also
suggested an increase in the
seating capacity of the gym. in-
stallation on Richardson Field
of adequate lighting for night
football, construction of a roof

ment weather, and construction
of an eighteen-hole golf course
on the site of the farm area
owned by the college on the
north edge of the campus.
Although there are adequate
justifications for the construc-
tion of these facilities, as have
been presented by Athletic Di-
rector Tom Scott and others in
the past, the committee failed

‘in its-report to present the justi-

fications for their recommenda-
tions, limiting itself to an ob-
jective of existing facilities and
to presenting no reasons for
adding new ones.

The same shortcoming of the
committee exists with regard to
the advocation of construction
of a greenhouse and limnologi-
cal laboratory on the Lake Cam-
pus. Nowhere in the report
are these needs presented and
supported, except for the one
sentence recommendations at
the end of the report,

GUEST HOUSING

In recommending a new guest
house the committee did point
out the need for ‘a larger num-
ber of rentable rooms for tran-
sients and excellent dining fa-
cilities.”

In its description of Ovens
College Union, the committee
did depart from its general pol-
icy on not commenting on the
adequacy of the facilities by
stating that, “For the present
enrollment and program of ac-
tivities, this building is consid-
ered fairly adequate.

However, although this is all
it has to say about the present
union, the committee recom-
mends “‘that plans be made soon
for the construction of a more

IFC Sets

New Silence Period

The Interfraternity Council
discussed the upcoming rush
parties, set a new period of si-
lence and made plans for the
National Interfraternity Confer-
ence at its meeting Monday
night.

The entire IFC plans to attend
the national conference Dec. 1-4
in Washington, D. C. Some of
the areas which the council will
investigate are IFC organiza-
tion, financing and authority,
systems of delayed rush, pledge
program standards and methods
of communication between fra-
ternities and faculty.

The schedule for picking up
and returning redates was es-
tablished. The freshmen will
pick up their redates next Mon-

59 Students Accepted
On Early Decision Plan

Fifty-nine members of the
Class of 1970 were accepted
this week on the Early Decision
Plan, H. Edmunds White, di-
rector of admissions, has an-
nounced.

Of the 120 applications, White
said, the remaining applicants
were deferred for consideration
under the regular plan. ,

The plan is for high school
seniors who “have good grades,
test seores, recommendations
and extracurricular activities
and who are certain they want
to attend Davidson,” according
to the college catalogue.

One member of the group is

-_

Charlie Scott. a senior at Laur-
inburg Institute. Scott was re-
cruited by Coach “Lefty” Drie- .
sell as a member of next year’s
freshman basketball team.

White also pointed to two
other future freshmen who had
attracted Driesell’s interest with
their ‘basketball prowess: Jan
Postma from Marianna, Fla.,
and Jerry Krowell ‘from Hous-
ton.

James Puckett, son of Dr.
W. O. Puckett, R. J. Reynolds
professor of biology, was also
in the group. Puckett is vale-
dictorian at North High School
and a member of the state

“We are glad to have this
plan,”’ White said. ‘It's good for
both us and the boys. From our
point of view, we've already got
22 per cent of our class deter-
mined. From their point of
view. it relieves a lot of their
worries to already know where
they're going to school.”

Approximately 10 members of
the group, or 17 per cent, are
from out of state, a figure rough-
ly comparable to last year’s
group. There were 121 appli-
cants and 65 acceptances in the

day in the lobby of Chambers
and will return them by 8 p.m.
Monday to ballot boxes which
will be set up in Chambers and
in the College Union.

A change was made in a pe-
riod of silence. There will be
no period of silence over the
concert weekend as originally
scheduled. A period of silence
will, instead, begin at 8 a.m.
Monday, and will last .until 8
a.m., Nov. 29. |

Because of the change, the
dorm rush previously planned
for the afternoon of Nov. 23,
was. changed to Nov. 30.

It was pointed out that dur-
ing a period of silence, a fra-
ternity man may not pick up a
hitchhiking freshman, even aft-
er ll p.m.

The decision was also made
that the redate parties operate
like rush parties in previous
years. Freshmen will be pick-
ed up at their dorm, walked
from party to party and walked
back to their dorm by fraternity
members.

The consensus of the IFC in
regard to the rush party held
last Saturday on Freshman Par-
ents Day seemed to be that it
was a success.

Tom Brown, IFC treasurer
and Pi Kappa Alpha represen-
tative, remarked. “I thought
that it was real good. It gave the
parents a good opportunity to
see a fraternity system which
is certainly unique among fra-
ternity systems. It also may
have helped to dispel some ideas
of fraternities as ‘dens of in-
iquity.” Most of the parents
seemed pretty impressed.”

present what are probably valid
needs; yet the total failure of
the committee to even begin to
state why the needs are valid
certainly presents a major
weakness in the report.

The report does note in its]}.

study of instrumental facilities
that “classroom and laboratory
space does not seem to be a
problem,”’ that office space is
“excellent and that ‘major
improvements" are needed for
Chambers Building, including
more electrical outlets, better
light control equipment, and a
remedy for the ‘extremely
poor’’ ventilation.

Dormitory space is adequate
for Davidson’s student body,
the report notes, but its state-
ment that “married housing is
not good’’ is at the least a vast
understatement. The committee
described the college's posses-
sions in this field of only four
three-room housing units. known
to some occupants as ‘The
Cardboard Village’, but fails
to propose any solution to the
poor housing situation.

The report also presents a list’
of parking lot capacities, which
if totaled, show that there are
over 50 more cars with student
permits than there are student
parking places, even when the
impractical parking area across
the street from the fine arts
building is included.

PARKING PROBLEMS

Noting. “If these cars were on
the campus at the same ‘time,
parking would be a serious prob-
Jem", the committee evidently
failed to recognize that most of
these cars are often on the
campus at the same time and
that parking is in fact a pretty
bad problem.

The report does give a fairly
complete description of David-
son’s existing physical plant and
does present some good recom-
mendations, but the failure to
discuss fuily the shortcomings
and needs of the physical plant
hamper to a great extent the ef-
fectiveness of the report.

The Physical Plant Commit-
tee was chaired by Dr. Tom
Scott, and included faculty mem-
bers R. T. Barber, E. E.
Brown, J. Y. Causey, D. G
Houchens, W. N. Mebane, W. E.
Meeks, O. J. Thies, and G. M.
Williams.

UNIQUE SPECIMEN

College ‘Gets The Axe’
From Davidson History

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

" President D. Grier Martin lit-
erally got the axe Wednesday

| afternoon.

“The axe” is a broadaxe dat-
ing from the time when David-
son was founded by Presbyte-
rians in days of yore. Dr.
Peter Pelham presented it to the
college, and it was accepted by
Dr. Martin and Dr. Chalmers
Davidson in a brief ‘ceremony
in Martin’s office.

Dr. Pelham is a descendant
of Maj. John Davidson, whose

daughter, Betsy Lee, married
her cousin William Lee David-
son, on whose land the college is
located.

Dr. Pelham is now president
of Mount Vernon Seminary in
Washington, D. C. Dr. Pelham's
father, Charles Pelham, was
also present at the ceremony.

Dr. Davidson explained the
significance of the instrument:
“Dr. Pelham, being a collat-
eral descendant of the family
who gave the land for David-
son College, had in his posses-
sion a broadaxe which origin-

idson and which was tradition-
ally used to hew the logs for the
origina! buildings of the col-
lege.”

According to Dr. Davidson the
axe is also of interest as.a speci-
men of the earliest manufacture
practiced in this area.

“The broadaxe represents the
first important, industrial devel-
opment in western North Caro-
lina, that of the iron foundries,”
Davidson explained.

“Major John Davidson was
one of the original developers of .
the ore in Lincoln County and
chiefly through his energy and
ability built up an exceptionally
useful and profitable industry.
The early fortune of such fam-
ilies as the Davidsons were
based on this industry. The Lin-
coln County furnaces and forges
furnished cannonballs for the
War of 1812."

It seems, then, that Davidson
may owe its existence to that
broadaxe in more ways than
one. In any case, the college has

; added a unique and interesting

item to its collection of David-
soniana.

of the information, he might get
his answer back audibly,
printed on a teletypewriter,

as a video image,

or a facsimile print.

Some of these services
aro available now.
Others are being tastcd.

For tho next week or so,
better get a move on.
