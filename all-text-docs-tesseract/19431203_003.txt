’Cat Five Opens Season On Friday

Meets Morris Field in First

Hardwood Battle
The 1943-44 Wildcat basketball

squad officially opens its season
Frday night at 8:15 in the Davidson
gym against the airmen of Morris
Field. This game will be important
in that it will give same indication
ef the power ef the war-weakend
Cat squad.

In spite of the loss of nine lettcr-
men to the armed forces from last
year's crack cage team, Coach Nor-
man Shepard is rapidly building a
fightag court aggregation ta send
into the wartime Southern Confer-
ence race With Jim Lowry, only
returning letterman, and Ed White,
of fast year’s frosh team, as a
nucleus, the Cat coach has been
building a polished quintet, filling

.| the remaining slots with standout

frosh cagers.
Lowry is expected ta head the
attack from the center position in-

stead of his usual guard slot. White
and freshman Bob Flowers will pro-
bably fill the guard positions, with
freshmen Mike Williams and Free-
man Jones in the forward slots.

A hard blow to the cagers is the
loss of Lennox Turnbull, a member
of last year’s freshman team, who
suffered an injury! to his shoulder in
practice early this week. It is hoped
that he will be back in the run
after.the Christmas: vacation.

Closely pressing the first stringers,
whase jobs are by no mean clinched,
are Sammy Hay, football captain
and ex-intramural star; J. D. Ash-
more, freshman football standout,
and Dick Chessen.

According to Coach Shepard the
squad has shown much improve-
ment since practice started. Al-
though the team is composed mainly
of young and unexperienced players,
a goad performance is expected
from them Friday night.
