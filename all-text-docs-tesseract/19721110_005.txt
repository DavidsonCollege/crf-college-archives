Parking Tickets Rape Students’ Purses

Never let it be said that my
fiery rhetoric is too sublime for
the meanest of issues, and since
other more vapid _ space
elsewhere in this 12-page
weekly cheesecloth polysyllabic
pitterpatter has been devoted to
the absence of space, car
space, I also have a few words
about the parking situation at
Davidson.

The first premise might be
called ‘‘The moral irrelevance
of revenue,’’ that is. what is
good for the administrative
piggy bank (enter the
comprehensive Phee-Phee
Bird) is not necessarily good for
the student body.

Parking tickets do not
promote the ecology nor do they
prepare Piggy Logan for the big

world outside. They are
designed primarily as a luxury
tax on students who bring their
wheels to campus.

Some people have been
reminded of this luxury as
much as three times each day.
Others run up a bill as great as
$200 a year for their vehicular
sins.

The students thus do their
unwilling share to support a
school that spends more time
and energy handing out tickets
than handing out an education.

The second premise concerns
administrative action, but since
this heading lacks substance
I will address myself rather to
what has not been done to
alleviate the burden of parking
and the accompanying tickets.

Personal Study Tried at Clemson

The professors in the psychology department at
Clemson University no longer give daily lectures and
regular tests to their students. Instead, they have
begun using the so-called Personalized System of In-
struction (PSI).

PSI is a self-paced method of learning based on the
assumption that learning is an individual matter. A
student who enrolls in a PSI course moves through the
course at his own speed. The course is divided into
units. When a student completes a unit, he is required
to take some form of mastery test or oral interview
which is given by an undergraduate student proctor
who has been chosen by the professor.

Failure to demonstrate satisfactorily one’s mastery
and understanding of the unit material to the proctor
is not held against the student. He simply must
restudy the unit material until he is proficient enough
to pass the interview or the written mastery test. The
grade for the course is determined by the number of
units completed in the course and by a final
examination.

The Personalized System of Instruction seems to be
highly successful at Clemson. Although there are a
large number of student drops (about .23 percent),
the majority of the students finish the course with an
SSA’.

All PSI students interviewed agreed that they lear-
ned more under PSI than they probably would have
learned given the same course in a standard lecture
format. One student said, ‘‘I really like PSI. I was
able to move at my own pace and finish ahead of time.
Now I can devote more time to my other subjects.”

Honors Programs Accused of Elitism

Elitism was a subject of concern at the recent an-
nual meeting of the National Collegiate Honors Coun-
cil in San Francisco. Many directors and students in
honors programs at various campuses across the
nation felt that charges of elitism are undermining
college honors programs.

The council discovered that many individuals
dislike certain privileges honors students have, such
as advance registration privileges, closer ties to
faculty members and administrators, and smaller
classes. The council agreed that accusations of
elitism have developed as students have taken a more
egalitarian approach to higher education, wanting
equality of opportunity for all students.

John Portz, president of the council, discussed
other problems that honors programs face besides the
problem of elitism charges. Portz stated that
student applications for honors programs have fallen
from last year. He also pointed out that honors
budgets have been cut on many campuses and that
many honors directors’ jobs are threatened.

In the first place, building
walls across a main street on
campus for inebriated jockdon
to drive their cars off of is not
the answer.

This only makes it more
difficult to get from one end of
the campus to the other via a
tour of the soccer, even if the
college can claim 15 more
available spaces for students.

Spencer’s Mountain (CGD),
that fiasco of red clay next to
Chambers, has not helped
matters since it swallows up the
old faculty-staff parking lot for
no apparent reason other than
the exaltation of an Allison
Fence declaring ‘‘Sorry for the
Inconvenience.”’

As a result, anyone wanting a
space on Concord Road during
school days anymore might find
himself riding all the way to
Egg Rock for a place to pull off
the road.

In addition to the fact that
nothing has been done to add
measurable space in the past
four years, there is the matter
of the traffic court.

This zoo belonged to the
administration until this year,
and back then it was easier to
get yourself a fix than get a
ticket taken care of through
appeal. The best thing the hill
ever did was to turn it over to
the students this year, but more

on this later.

There is one other innovation
which the administration has
made in reference to parking
through the work-study
program in creating a vigilante
group of students to do the dirty
work along with Linker.

I have heard a report that one
of these Minifuzz almost got his
own ticket punched while billing
the car of a fellow student.
Anyone under 22 caught billing
my car may consider himself a
potential hit-and-run victim,
and just imagine the esthetic
immediacy of a face being
recapped while the rest of the
body spreads a racing stripe
down the street the color of
current jelly.

Unfortunately those students
coerced into this hazardous line
of work have little choice in the
matter, and the last one I tried’
to question was brandishing a
net and trident and started
yelling, ‘‘Zacho, he plenty mad
man!”’

My advice to the work-study
program is that instead of
contributing to the financial
rape of the students, it might
better spend its time checking
on all its impoverished
recipients who have their own
unregistered vehicles which

they are not supposed to be able

to afford on campus. Surprise,
surprise.

The last premise might be
called ‘‘the relevance of student
action.’ The traffic court this
year took the only reasonable
and appropriate measure
available by excusing every
ticket which was appealed until
the student Senate could rehash
the ridiculous fines which
existed in the past.

This temporary suspension of
fines created no ‘‘chaos’’ on
campus except in a few palsied
minds trained in administrative
apologetics, and the only real
effect was a decrease in
paranoia among students.

There 18 nothing
reprehensible, morally or
otherwise, in thwarting a
corrupt and petty
administrative practice which
has bled the student wallet for
too long, and Peeples and
Cunningham are to. be
commended for the way they
have handled the entire mess.

I trust this exposee has not
been indiscreet, for I realize
that only by tackling the really
big problems at Davidson will
we ever get down to the ones of
lesser importance, like getting
rid of about 500 wasps to make
room for all the black students
coming to Davidson next year.

Ladies Of The Night Have Fun
With Restaurant Approaches

Standing in the main salon of
Mooresville Bakery. I smelled
hot doughnuts tossed into
greasy little sacks. The treat
tastes strange tonight.

Arms encircle me from
behind and a body moves
warmly against my back. Lips
carressed my ear and
whispered that I had been here
before. Yes, now I realize.

Charlottesville, Virginia
glaring fluorescent beacon, not
Carolina hot bread and brown
panelling. University Diner, not
grim baker. I was scared
forgetting the U.D., but I hada
hunch I could remember.

Distinctions of cities and all-
night eateries blend into one
another at 3 a.m. Charlotte
becomes Atlanta and Richmond
and Danville and _ even
Charlottesville.

I was pretty sure where I was
though. The waitress smiled
when I ordered my grilled
With. (When she left I began to

-wonder what a grilled With

was. )

Waitress returned to my right
to serve. Her _ briskness
highlighted the uneventful room
that night. She stood by for a
moment looking at the way I
sat, my clothes and customary
bare feet.

She expected recognition or
conversation and sat down to
wait. From behind a hand
began to massage my shoulder
and fingernails lightly etched
my skin. I turned, looked
closely into the loveliest face I
had ever seen.

Deep brown skin covered
more than ordinary skin, more
than skin was meant to cover. A
shock of black hair fell over
both eyes, and I looked into an
open and pouting smile.

Even her smgll was different
from any I had known or
expected. Every dark face

hides some mystery which can
excite. Lord though rarely
creates white face of any
intrigue.

‘‘Hey baby, you ain't gonna
eat all that food and go to bed by
yourself, are you?”’

‘‘Honey, you leave that man

be, he ain't even got no shoes
on.”’
“Baby, things been so slow
tonight I'm ready to do one for
free. Man I might just let you
have one on me.”

There were now three ladies
with me. At the last remark all
howled madly. One grabbed a
friend’s arm and two grabbed
mine.

Now four in my lonely booth.
Lights above shined more than
the girls liked. People of the
night find asylum in this light
only a moment.

“Feel that arm, will you.
Must be a schoolboy.”

‘Schoolboy, shit. Dress em
up, buy em books, send them to
school and all they want to do is
eat the...”

“Shut your damned mouth.
This one here is a nice school
boy. Hell, he’s a school man!"

More laughter from all sides.

Prostitutes are nothing new.
Even in South Virginia they
have a respected occupation in
social clans. Every tenant
farmer knows who's sporting
and where. Banks see the big
money come back on Monday
morning. Quality is low,
though; a great premium on
those who don’t curse in bed.

I had never met ladies so
gentle and young. Now a pro is
fair game anyplace except in a
restaurant. There she is like
any other animal with food. Any
approach she considers an
attack on her meal and she
responds as an animal. Thoreau
said salvation was in wildness. I
wonder if this is what he means.

By now we could all
communicate, and talk would
begin to turn to business. I
watched the waitress, though,
as she dropped her hand to the
junction of her legs and then
slid a forefinger back and forth
at her throat. I read the sign as
did my two friends.

‘Well shit. What are you doin’
telling all you know, bitch. He
ain’t no different, let him take a
chance. It ain’t even for certain.
Anyway I'm tired and I don’t
wanna go back up town.”’

Second woman cackled at her
friend’s despair. ‘‘Honey we
don’t ever get students
anymore. She just likes
you, cause you go to
school. Few years ago it was
fun. We were as respectable as
the liquor store. Now it’s too
easy to get some, over in those
dorms. What we do for money is
the big damn college sport for
amateurs.”’

Yeah but I'll tell you. We've
always been treated real good
here. My Momma told me she
heard that Ol’ Thomas
Jefferson himself brought the
first whores up here. Slaves
built him a big old house down
there by where the railroad
tracks are now.

Just to keep them students off
the farms and messin’ round.
Couldn't get no whores up here
for a long time though, and he
had to run it himself by hand."

Knowing now, at last, some
humble unhappiness. Lives
tolerant of human intolerance,
accepting all strangers.
Watching this night blend
madly into all the other nights
of the two ladies at the U.D., we
laughed long and again, and
more at everything said.

Somehow I don't believe
Jefferson realized he had much
of a problem.
