FROM THE
BENCH

ROCKY CROsswHITE

The Windy City

During the trip to Chicago last weekend, our loss
to the University of lowa wasn’t the only thing that
went wrong. There were a good many insignificant
mistakes which led up to the conclusion Saturday
night.

The Thursday before we left, Mike O'Neill received
a letter from Irish Echo magazine, which could possi-
bly be the exiled voice of the IRA (Irish Revolution
Army) in America. Anyway it seems that the magazine
picks an athlete of the month for each issue, so they
decided that O’Neili was a good Irish name and wanted
to know what part of Ireland his forefathers were
from. This was fine in that O’Neill’s family is Irish
but the next day Mike Maloy received the same in-
quiry. I know that Maloy sounds Irish but let’s not
be absurd.

We left on Friday and flew into Chicago’s O’Hare
Field. For those of you who have never had the
pleasure of flying into that airport, it’s one of the
few places I know of where it takes longer to taxi
to the terminal building than it does to fly to Char-
lotte. They even have road signs on the approaches
to the runways to keep the jets from hitting each
other on the ground.

Once safely in the terminal building, we rented
several cars and headed for Chicago Stadium for our
afternoon practice. I had the fortune of getting in
a car with Tony Orsbon at the wheel and Fox De-
Moisey navigating. We were lost inside of 30 minutes
but at least we saw most of the city. Also we were
greeted by such signs as “Mayor Daley weicomes you
to the great city of Chicago,” and “Happy Valentine's
Day—America, The Chicago Police Department.” At
least they’re advertising.

After our sight seeing tour, we found the Stadium
with help of directions from one of Chicago's finest.
Whenever we work out on a large coliseum-type floor
which only has two baskets, Lefty has eight members
of the team‘ that play shooting at both baskets. The
remainder of the team, the skins, usually go off to
one side of the court and run through the opposing
team’s offense. Besides this we also run up and down
the steps of the auditorium dribbling a ball or just
trying to look busy until we’re needed.

Unfortunately, in Chicago we could only find four
balls, and the starters used these. One of the managers
went out and borrowed a half-inflated rubber ball
from the Boy’s Club across the street and gave it
to the skins. We couldn’t dribble but we had a good
time passing it around.

We stayed at Lake Shore Holiday Inn which over-
looks frozen Lake Michigan. With its 33 floors and
revolving restaurant, the building is really nice. The
four elevators used to go upstairs are the fastest
machines I have ever seen. One time I wanted to get
off on the third floor but before I could push a button,
we were at six and rising. Too bad our offense didn’t
run _.as well that night.

The programs for Saturday night’s games read
“The University of Jowa vs. Davidson University.”
A roster of the players inside had several names
spelled wrong. and other mistakes on heights, weights
and such, but the biggest error appeared where Lefty’s
name was supposed to be. The ili-favored paper book-
let had the Head Davidson basketball coach’s name
listed as Harv Schmidt. Somebody really messed up
there. Harv Schmidt sounds like a beer sign or some-
thing.

enyway old Harv was not very happy after the
game and he had every right not to be. We shot 28%
and lost by 15 points. Before the game a resident of
Chicago told me the only thing he knew about David-
son was that the college had a good basketball team.
1 wonder what he thinks now.

LEWIS MILLS
A Blend Of Color, Class

Tuesday Night
Is Mills Night

By BOB DUNHAM
Sports Editor

It would indeed be an
understatement to label
Lewis Mills as ‘‘color
ful.” .

Lefty Driesell is color
ful. Lou Carnesecca is
colorful. But Lewis Mills
is more than colorful.
He is color with a bit of
showmanship added in.
He is characterized by
an ability to please a
crowd.

crowd.

Last season's game in
Johnston Gym saw Mills
turn in disbelief from a
referee's call. look into
the student section and
ask, “Did you see that
one?"’

Mills takes a bit more
ribbing from Wildcat
supporters than do most
of the coaches who fre-
quent the local gym, but
Mills always takes the’
ribbing a bit better than
the rest, too. There is
always a smile or a
wave to the crowd.

When Mills’ Spiders
come to Davidson Tues-
day night, they will
bring a_ disappointing
record with them. But
one can bet that Lewis
Mills will be just as
crowd-pleasing as ever,
for Mills has that added
class which compliments

the result of miracle-work-

ed a team that two year
ago wasn't good enough to
make the conference tourna
ment into the highest scor-
ing team in the Southern
with an 85.8 average.

The Colonials’ scoring suc.
cess is due largely to a
couple of Tallents namely
Bob and Mike. Bob. a senior
transfer from Kentucky, is
leading the conference with
a 30.2 average while little

brother Mike is hitting at a '
