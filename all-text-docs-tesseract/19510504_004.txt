As a prelude to the Spring Frolics dances, the Campus Club
on Friday night held a banquet in honor of their five members
graduating this spring. Keynoted by informality, the function
was held in the reereation room of the local Methodist church,
with the ladies of the church providing the menu. Bill Suttles

was toastmaster. Piano selections
were rendered by David Bridgeman,
and Miss Billie Mancin, of Char-
lotte, presented a toe dance. A
quartet composed of Charles Her-
ion, Owen Leland, Bill Suttles and
Russ Miller, gave forth with the
“Tennessee Waltz” in true Spike
Jones harmony.

The latter part of the program
featured Russ Miller, who, accom-
pained by Owen Leland at the pi-
ano, sang “Home” and an aria from
Verdi's “Riggoletto”. In addition,
he presented a pantomine skit
which he had lifted from an old
TV show, and called on Bill Sut-
tles for a rendition of “When that
Red-Red-Robin Comes S8ob-Bob-
Bobbin’ Bobbin’ Along” that‘probably made¢ Johnson ve eee that ‘probably made

court at Statesville subjecting the
defendant to the possibility of high-
er court costs and inconvenience.

As we understand it, this situation

is peculiar to the court at Moores-
ville and one wonders why.

While the fine stands excessively
high, it still stands; and while there
is inconvenience and extra cost in
a jury trial in superior court, it
seems there is going to remain that
inconvenience and extra cost to
those who wotld speed. All violat-
ors should pay for their violation.
But there should be a scale rather
than a blanket with which the price
is set for the particular offense.
