Students To Scrape
Bricks During Class

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell announced today that
students will scrape bricks
during the two Saturday classes
this term.

It appears that the college
saved the bricks from the old
union to be used to extend
Davidson’s network of brick
sidewalks.

“The problem is that the old
concrete needs to be scraped
off. This is where the students
come in,’’ Cornell said.

Students will report to their
Saturday classes at the ap-
pointed times when they will be
supplied with a metal hammer
to scrape off the concrete.

“Students say they want to
help the college economy, so
here's where they can help,” he
said. Brick sidewalks are num-
ber one on our list of priorities.

“After all, when you think
it out what college doesn’t
have brick sidewalks, *’ he ad-
ded. ““When I was out at Pomona
they had brick sidewalks. These
are essential to the modern
college.”

Historian in residence

Chalmers Davidson hailed the
brick scraping days as a new
tradition at Davidson.

A display case of bricks has
been set up in the library and
several books on bricks have
been put on reserve, according
to Davidson.

In a rare display of controlled
emotion, Student Body
President Ralph Peeples
responded to the announcement
by saying, ‘‘Nocomment.”’

Several faculty members
however were outspoken again-
st the Cornell plan, but few
could agree as to why they were
against it.

One faculty member said he
was against the plan after he
realized Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan supported it. When he
learned that Bevan had
proposed credit for the outing,
the faculty member said,
“That's just academic gold-

Bevan tried to explain that
the brick scrape was a new, in-
novative, modern approach to
interdisciplinary study which
all the colleges are doing now
days. But his efforts were
fruitless.

Davidson Gets Threat.
+ In Nixon Ultimatum

The Nixon Administration
has given the college until mid-
night tonight to dismiss or
suspend certain professors and
students considered offensive to
the government or face
“maximum and_ effective
retaliation of the severest sort."

Usually reliable sources in-
side the government report that
the Nixon administration,
realizing how quickly the North
Vietnamese buckled under
when their cities were bombed,
has decided to use similar tac-
tics to bring dissident colleges
into line in support of Nixonian
politics.

Whether the administration
will choose to use such severe
measures in the case of David-
son or not is_ uncertain.
College officials refused to
comment on whether specific
forms of retaliation were given
by the government.

The college was contacted
last week by government of-
ficials who gave the college 10
days to suspend notorious
radicals on the campus or face
an uncertain result.

Professors William E.
Jackson Jr. of the political
science department and Max E.
Polley of the Religion faculty,
absent from the start of classes
last week, were contacted in
Davidson over the weekend but
refused to comment on reports
the college was using them to
negotiate with government of-
ficials led by Gerald Friedheim
of the Defense Department.

Ironically, the two are repor-
tedly on the list to be suspended.
The condition worsened after
the “Prayer for Peace” meeting
on Jan. 4. The names of YMCA
President Larry Duncan and

Coach Wave tf agg groaned,
“but it’s not me I’m worried
about as much as the fine young
Wildcatters that will
deprived of their God-given
right to belt people.

‘Davidson has always en-
joyed the reputation of being a
tough-nosed bunch of fighters,”
he added, ‘‘but now it looks like
we're chickening out."

Brickels thereupon offered to
drive up to the Colonel Sander’s
in Mooresville and buy for
everybody. Fagg declined com-
ment.

Fagg has reportedly been
contacted for a special teams’
position at Alabama under
‘“‘Bear’’ Bryant, but must wait
until the present waterboy
graduates before moving. |

Terry Holland, head
basketball coach, received word
on the decision one day after the
college was put on suspension
by the NCAA for recruiting
violations.

The violation stemmed from
an investigation which charged
Holland with using another
sports program to ‘‘cover up” a
basketball scholarship recruit-
ment.

The player in question, 7'4”
Edgar ‘Eiffel’ Keszarsky, was
reputedly a legitimate golf
team ringer, until it was
discovered that his handicap
was 36--‘‘either twice his shoe
size or half his I. Q., whichever
way you want to look at it,”
stated NCAA _ spokesman
Farley Breen.

“The whole
ludicrous,'" commented
Holland. ‘‘Besides Koszarsky

Religion Professor Daniel
Rhodes, two of the sponsors of
the meeting, were added to the
list.

On the original list were Er-
nie Patterson and Charles
Ratliff of the Economics Depar-
tment, W. Brown Patterson of
the History Department, and
Thomas F. Clark of the Religion
faculty (reportedly at the
suggestion of Billy Graham as a
threat to the religious unity of
the country).

Other students on the list
were SGA President Ralph
Peeples, McGovern campaign
director Erwin Barron and
DAVIDSONIAN editor Rich
Wilson.

Dean of Students Will Terry
was also listed.

The college administration
although denying the verity of
the reports, has made some
preparations for what it con-
siders the inevitable result of

standing up for academic
freedom.

Tuesday and Wednesday the
college organ’ in_ Love
Auditorium was _— secretly
dismantled and boxed.

It is to be moved during the
day today. The two Xerox
machines in Chambers will be
moved to Mooresville for safe
keeping after office hours.

Sympathetic sources in the
administration, contacted late
Wednesday night, identified
some of the sites reportedly on
the bombing target list. These
included the Rho Alpha Chi
(PAX) house, Cunningham
Fine Arts Building, and E. H.
Little Dormitory (reportedly
because men and women live
together in it), in addition to
Chambers Building. Hattie’s
was also mentioned on the list of
strategic support centers for
the campus.

Participants Leave
On ‘Organs Abroad’

“Organs Abroad," a new
Davidson travel-study
program, will send its first par-
ticipants to Europe July 5-
August 12. Music Professor
Wilmer Hayden Welsh and ap-
proximately a dozen eager
students will make the trip,
checking out European organs
of all shapes and sizes.

“T couldn't think of a more
pleasurable and satisfying way

to spend the summer,” Welsh

said ‘‘We’re hoping we can get in-

side some of the larger organs

Discards

golf game is improving too.”’

“Anyway, this is the last
straw,’’ raged Holland as he
prepared his resignation. ‘‘It
proves that this place never
cared at all about the job we
were doing. I should’ve gone to
Wake like Mom said.”

Scott boozingly submittingly
submitted his resignation along
with Fagg and Holland, saying
that he was ‘‘innshulted
bekawse noboddy efen tolde me
fashe to fashe. How humilio-,
How himisti-, how
dizhgushtink! I haddto find owt
from good ol’ Ray Turn-hic-er,
bilesh his liddle hearrt.”’

Spencer dishearteningly ac-
cepted all the resignations, but
claimed that the college was
‘working on a sports schedule
for next year.”

‘So far we've contacted
Washington and Lee, the Fort
Bragg All-Stars, and the Hollins
Intramural squad. It looks like
it might be a good year for us.”’

and really explore them in
depth.”’

The participants need not
have any knowledge of music to
make the trip. ‘‘All that we ask
is that they be truly interested
in finding out about some of the
best and most interesting
organs around.”

Sophomore Bill Bass said he
expected that the trip would be
“titillating, even scintillating,
perhaps. I think we can really

get into those o organs, especially
if they let us play.”’

Welsh stated that before the
students leave, they will be
given comprehensive _in-
structions about what and what
not to do with the organs. ‘‘We
don’t want to get anyone in
trouble because of ignorance,”
Welsh stated.

Freshman Bob Fluter said
that he had always wanted to
see Europe and that, with this
program, he could pick up some
valuable experience on the side.
“A well-made organ is an
exquisite thing, and we’ll get to
experience some of the best.”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John Mr. Bevan said that
he thought the program should
be ‘quite an experience” and
very educational. ‘‘I wouldn’t
_—_ going myself,’’ Bevan
said.

Other programs under con-
sideration for future use include
“Electric Organs of the
Americas’’, ‘“‘Accordians
Abroad’’, and for science
majors ‘‘Mammalia Abroad’’.

When asked for his comment
on the action, Vice President for

President Samuel R. Spencer

ness coupled significant, and
