THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING

Ever think of moving off-cam-
pus? While it definitely has its
advantages, living off-campus is
not all pure amusement. In fact, if
scrubbing bathroom scum, fork-
ing over a check each month, or
undertaking the occasional run in
with a plumber doesn’t sound like
fun, it may not be for you.

However, for 109 Davidson
sophomores, juniors, and seniors,
the glories of life off-campus far
outweigh the housekeeping hor-
rors. Now responsible for their
own toilet paper, they have de-
cided to leave the comfort of those

Making the move

Upperclassmen share views of living off-campus

lovable hall counselors and brave
living on their own.

The obvious conveniences are
overwhelming. As anyone who
has ever survived life on a fresh-
men hall will gladly admit, space is
not exactly abundant. Once off-
campus, whether in an apartment
or a house, increased living quar-
ters are almost a guarantee. Also,
junior Henry Darst says that he
enjoys not having to put up with
excessive noise and adds that his
bathrooms are cleaner than those
shared by ar entire hall.

Susanne Herring, one of the
29 females living off-campus, ap-
preciates the privacy of having her
own room, cooking her meals at

fat count of, oh, say 99 grams. This
is equivalent to an entire plate of
fettucini alfredo or a single order
of Scallion Chicken from Lotus.

The English may have one
upped us on eloquent accents, bet-
ter French Fries (the chip is one of
the better things to have come out
of that country, next to “Abso-
lutely Fabulous!” of course), and
cool castles, but as my friend said,
“These people don’t know the first
thing about making a decent de-
odorant — or wearing one!” I
don’t think it’s so much that they
tryto offend everyone around them.
They simply don’t have a concept
of the benefits of using a device to
mask one’s less than pleasing
bodily functions. Deodorant is not
just for your own well-being; it’s a
gift you give your neighbor.

I guess it’s not fair of me to
blame the English for this. The
main perpetrators of this crime of
nature were the flood-like tour
groups of teenage Italians. They
could call us loud, obnoxious
Americans quite legitimately, but
one thing we were not was teenag-

ers. Try and picture the kid that .

played Vinnie on “Doogie
Howser.” Now multiply that im-
age by 95 on any given day or at
any given hour. They made even
us feel like locals, and that’s say-
ing something.

Despite taking a dive in the
River Cam while punting, falling

‘downa flight of stairs on the double

decker bus, and getting my back-
pack stuck between the closing
doors of a train (I was on the out-
side, my pack was not), England
was glorious. The tea was cheap,
and so was the Guiness, and so
were the hostels — for reasons that
became glaringly clear once you
had paid your five pounds for a
short, thin mattress in a room with
a dozen or so large Germans that
may or may not have been other
girls. I think they may still be
taking steroids over there. And if
you ever feel like sleeping on the
floor of the YMCA in Dover, En-
gland with 50 other people (most
of whom you don’t know) and
sharing one shower is something
you must do to live a fulfilled life,
well, remember: there are people
out there who will steal your towel.
Oh, and don’t forget to ask Dave
Dwyer about the fight he started at
a pub in Cambridge. Good story.

home, and, of course, the extra
space to “hang out.”

For many students, off-cam-
pus living is a well deserved change
of pace. Herring knew that a sub-
stantial number of juniors would
go abroad for either a semester or
the year. Often, they can alleviate

which captures the hyper, happy,
aura about the CD. “Stash,” origi-
nally from A Picture of Nectar,
follows, leading us to question life
and other deep, human concerns
such as rotting solar garlic.

The third track, “Gumbo,” fea-
tures true elements of jazz, most
noticeably the trumpet intertwined
in the chorus. “Montana,” a new
insturmental track, is short, but
Fishman and Gordon’s percussion
and bass truly groove.

The 21-minute “You Enjoy
Myself,” originally from Junta, is
absolutely incredible and far better
and more relaxed than the original.

The second disc contains ma-

‘terial from A Picture of Nectar,

Lawn Boy, and several unreleased
tracks that by no means lack the
talent and versatility that is ever-
present in Phish quality. The 31-
minute jam on “Tweezer” is crazy
and unstoppable — I loved it.

the hassle of coordinating room
assignments by moving off-cam-
pus. Though Herring decided to
remain in Davidson, getting out on
her own was just the “something
different” she was looking for.

ning to (or already has) worn off,
you may find yourself asking how
to arrange for off-campus housing.
The Residence Life Office can help.
Though they only accept a few
students, accommodations in
Davidson are fairly accessible for
interested students.

The album’s finale, “The
Squirming Coil,” is by far the best,
most intense song on the CD.

Page McConnell on the key-
boards is incredible, and the en-

ergy level is amazing as he brings
the song to a shattering climax,
then ends the album with an amaz-
ing piano solo that is definitley
phunkengriiven.
