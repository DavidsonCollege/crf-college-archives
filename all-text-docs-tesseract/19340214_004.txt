In the general sales and turnover
taxes is seen the beginning of a new
and miportant form of taxation by the
American States, Dr. B. U. Ratchford,
Duke University economist, declares in
an article in the Harvard Business Re-
view.... “It is true that two of these
laws are due to expire in 1934,” says
Dr. Ratchford, “and that eight others
will terminate in 1935, but it is quite
probable that most of them will be re-
enacted, perhaps with modifications

John B. Christenbury, who has made
an enviable record coaching at Cross-
nore, has been granted a leave_of ab-
sence to take additional work at Co-
Jumbia University. He took over Cross-
“‘nore’s team with the athletic depart-
ment $200 in debt and wound up the
first year, 1930-31, owing only $13. Dur-
ing the season he gave Mitchell County
its first football performances. He also
put in basketball and won-a dozen

was elected ‘secretary of the North
Carolina Club at Columbia, and he has

J. H. McKinnon, of Jacksonville,
Fla., has accepted a call as assistant
pastor of First Presbyterian Church
at Durham. He will go ta Durham in
the early summer and will remain until
fall, at which time he will return to

Lenoir to manage the furniture fac-
tory which his father had founded.

Then he decided that music, and not
business, was his career, and this de-
cision was reached in spite-of the fact
that he was eminently successful in his
business endeavors.

Since he took over the Lenoir High
SchoofBand there has been a remark-
able development in the» interest in
music in Lenoir. Recently the town
voted the extra tax assessment for the
schools, in order that the band could
be retained. That shows the feeling
of the people of Lenoir for the band.
Letters have been received from many
prominent people in this country and
abroad, congratulating the band and
the director.

The organization has played at most
of the colleges in North Carolina, has
won many przes for high school bands,
and has in many other ways been hon-

»] ored.

Mr. Harper himself is recognized as
a leader in the musical field, and par-
ticularly in the field of high school
bands, having been recently elected one
of the three directors of the National
School Band and Orchestra Associa-
tion, He has written several marches,
one of them, “The Fencing Master,”
having gained popularity throughout
the country. :
Mr. Harper accepts no pay for his
services; in fact, he puts money into
the Lenoir band, and considers it a
wise investment. The interest that has
been aroused in music in Lenoir is
shown by the fact that, out of a stu-
dent body of 303 pupils, 75 are in the
senior band, 40 are in the junior band,
and there are 115 on the waiting list
to try out for the band.

The best tobacco for pipes
comes from Kentucky .. and it’s
called “White Burley”

E use White Burley in making

YY Granger Rough Cut. It comes
from the Blue Grass region of Kentucky
—ripe, mild leaf tobacco that just about
tops them‘all for fragrance and flavor.

From the right place on the stalk we
select the kind that’s best for pipes. Then
we make it into Granger by Wellman’s
Method and cut it up into big shaggy flakes.

White Burley tobacco— made the way
old man Wellman taught us how to make
it— that’s Granger.

“Cut rough to smoke cool’?
is the way pipe smokers
describe Granger —try tt
