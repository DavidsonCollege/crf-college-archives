ROUSSELOT PRESENTS HIS CASE
“Anti-Communism And Patriotism Are Not Enough”

Bircher Shows Society
in Unexpected Fashion

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Probably the best way to de-
scribe it is that everyone was
a little surprised, to say the
least. From all past experi-
ences in the average Davidson
student’s tenure here, any
speaker who professed to be
a right-wing conservative has
been inarticulate and overly
biased in his opinions. But John
Bircher:- John H. Rousselot was
not.

A former Congressman from

California, Rousselot is now na-’

tional director of public rela-
tions for the John Birch Society.
He appeared concerned over the
problem that his group has been
misrepresented by the press and
by members of the society itself.
It was his professed aim to
clarify the opinions of the so-
ciety and to create interest in
its operations.

Interesting enough was his
brief sketch of the society’s
namesake, John Birch, who was
a militarily-oriented missionary
in China during World War II.

Birch was a real hero in the
fight against Communism after
the war, Rousselot said. but he
was murdered in his prime by
“typical Communist tactics,
stategy and style.” It was his
death that drew the battle lines
of the “undeclared World War
1.”

Founded in Indianapolis in
1958 by Robert Welch, the Birch
Society now boasts about 5,000
chapters averaging between 10
and 30 members each. ‘*Anti-
communism and patriotism are
not enough to become a mem-
ber.”’ Rousselot said. A_per-
son must also have ‘‘good will,
conscience and high religious
ideals.”

This country, he continued,
“must pull itself out of the evil
of collectivism to individual-

ity." The Birchers’ battle cry
is more responsibility and less
government.

The Communist ‘criminal con-
spiracy is threatening our world
and it is every Bircher’s duty
to stop it, Rousselot explained
as he outlined the group's plan
of action. ‘We are aiding the
desemination of books and
pamphlets, such as J. Edgar
Hoover’s (asters of Deceit, in
order to make the public aware
of the danger which is within
our country as well as with-
out.”” The society is also push-
ing the circulation of conserva-
tive literature, and is attempting
to contrast the effect of radio
and television commentators in
their view of the John Birch So-
clety.

In addition, the society is be-
ginning a massive letter-writing
campaign to stimulate interest,
and is forming ad hoe commit-
tees, sucli as a group supporting
the local organizations of law
and order, the police.

“We are attempting to wake
up America to the activities of
pro-communist groups, the Ku
Klux Klan and the American
Nazi party. Our weapon is to
make known the backgrounds of
leaders and members of these
groups.”

One of the things which dis-
turbs the society most is that
of the articles of legislation out-
lined by Communist leader Wil-
Nam Foster in his book, To-
ward a Soviet America, some
20 years ago, of which about
70 per cent has already been
passed.

The core of the belief of the
society is that ‘individuals are
the important tenants of life,”
he said. However, “‘too few are
accepting the responsibility to
participate." Morality is falling
down and ‘‘just not enough peo-
ple are involved.” -

[Off-Campus Events,
‘|Road Trips Examined

The joint Faculty-Trustee Committee on Alcoholic
Beverage Policy met Monday night to discuss the recent
faculty action in the drinking regulation change.

The meeting was open to all
faculty members and Trustees,
and certain. students represent-
ing -various organizations on
campus were extended oral in-
vitations to attend.

Trustees attending the meet-
ing were Dr. J. McDowell Rich-
ards and D. R. LaFar Jr., presi-
dent and vice-president of the
board respectively. Approxi-
mately 20 faculty members were
also present.

Students who attended includ-
ed Jim Terry and Al Carson
from the IFC, Bill Council and
Billy Clark from the Student
Council, Jim Stokes from the
Honor Court. and Tom Earn-
hardt and George Kuykendall!
from the Social Life Evaluation
Committee.

According to Dr. J. G. Martin.
a member of the. joint commit-
tee. the committee hesitated to
throw the meeting open to the
whole student body. “The stu-
dents who attended represented
many varied aspects of student
opinion.” he continued.

However, no member of the
Social Council was invited to at-
tend the meeting: despite the
that the council was jnvolved in

Ensemble
To Play
On Monday

The Davidson College Wind
Ensemble will entertain the col-
lege and community with a con-
cert in Hodson Hall at 8:15 p.m.
next Friday.

Whereas the concert is not to
be primarily a holiday perform-
ance, it will include two brass
choir selections appropriate for
the season: ‘‘Canzona No. 2” by
Gabrieli and a sulte of tradition-
al Christmas carols arranged by
Leroy Anderson. The brass choir
will be composed of selected
members of the Wind Ensemble.

The Wind Ensemble itself will
present ‘‘Serenade for Clarinets"’
by Pierne, ‘“‘Symphony for
Band" by the French composer
Jadin, the ‘Jericho’? number
which was performed in- the
Ensemble’s chapel program.
“Carnival” by H. Owen Reed
and a brassy circus march by
Karl King.

Dr. Grier M. Williams, direct-
or of the Wind Ensemble, indi-
cated that he will select several
of the works from this program
for performance on the organ-
ization’s tour to Florida this
March, so that this Friday's con-
cert will give the college com-
munity a chance to hear a por-
tion of the tour program.

and had proposed one question
that was discussed at the Mon-
day night meeting.

“AN OVERSIGHT’

Martin, commenting on the
statement of Campbell, said that

[

aS,

it was simply an oversight. }|

“They should have had an in-
vitation.”’

Martin said that the first is-
sue discussed was that of trips
of college organizations. He said

college’s business whether a stu-
dent drinks on organization
trips; and can the coaches and
advisors control the students
without rules and regulations?”

Opinions on both sides of the
issue were expressed. Repre-
senting the coaches’ viewpoint.
expressed earlier in THE
DAVIDSONIAN by Coach Heath
Whittle. were Coach Harry
Fogleman and Dr. Tom Scott.
director of athletics.

DISCIPLINE PROBLEM

Whittle. had made the state-
ment. earlier that ‘‘since the
minor sports have no scholar-
ships. a problem of team dis.
cipline could conceivably arise."

The second issue brought up
was the question raised earlier
by Campbell in THE DAVID
SONIAN. He had stated, ‘‘The
change puts pressure on the So-
elal Council to sponsor off-cam-
pus parties so that students may
drink.”

Martin said that “not all agree
with Campbell, and this question:
caused much interest.’’ Martin
continued, “everybody stated
their views on the issue, but no
vote was taken — this commit-
tee just forms en opinion and
proposes: we are not an execu-
tive committee.”

A third point discussed was
college liability in case of ac-
cidents involving college-owned
automobiles or cars used in ser-
vice of the school. Martin said
that the college carried $500,000
of liability insurance, but that
there was still the college's mor-
al responsibility.

CLARIFICATION

At the urging of several stu- |
dents atending the meeting of
the joint committee, Richard C.
Burts, dean of students, issued a
statement clarifying the faculty
action. This statement was dis-
tributed after chapel Wednesday.

Martin. gave THE DAVIDSON.
IAN his opinion on the meaning
of the sections of the faculty ac-
tion. ‘In some circumstances
drinking is proper, but in others
it is not. It is proper in a res-
taurant, bar or party where it
is served, but not at a concert
or theater. Loss of equilibrium
at a. party is not the same as
ata ball game.”

Burks’ Honor Proposals

By JOHN SAILEY
Davidsonian Stat? Writer

John Burks, senior representa-
tive on the Honor Court, will pre-
sent his proposals in assembly
Monday for equalizing the en-
forcement of the Student Body
Regulations among the Honor
Court, the Student Council and
the student body as a whole.

Burks has stated that he large-
ly has the concurrence of the
members of the Honor Court
and Student Council for his plan,
which calls for the deletion from
the oath of office for the two
arms of student government of
the words, ‘‘that I will be honor
bound to report any violation of

the Honor System or any other
provision of the constitution
which comes under my observa-
tion.””

He is quick to emphasize that
“this has absolutely nothing to
do with the Honor System,” the
enforcement of which is already
provided for in Article VII, Sec-
tion 4 of the Student Body Con-
stitution.

The purpose of the deletion is
to no longer require members
of the Honor Court and Student
Council to report violations of
the Student Body Regulations
which the students themselves
are unwiling to enforce.

Burks also proposes to ‘‘call

for a general referendum on all
of the present Student Body Re-
gulations, in order to determine
for which of the regulations the
student body is willing to as-
sume responsibility.”

He {s pursuing his plan of ac-
tion on the assumption that “if
student jurisdiction is valuable,
it is worth the responsibility of
the whole student body, not just
the officers of the student gov-
ernment.”

The central importance of
placement of responsibilty for
enforcement is emphasized by
both Burks and Jim Stokes,
chairman of the Honor Court.
Stokes stated that “‘the proposal

To Be Offered Monday

will put more responsibility on
the students, which is good.” He,
too, pointed out that the Honor
System will not be endangered.

Burks said that necessary im-
plications of the plan will elther
be an acceptance on the part
of the student body of responsi-
bility for enforcement or else a
rejection of this. responsibility
with the consequences that
“original jurisdiction . . . should
reside with the faculty.”

An informal “Open End” type
discussion will be held in the
Union Monday night to discuss
the proposals and answer any
questions on the part of stu-
dents.

the questions were: ‘‘Is it the|’...

109 Students Receive

Academic Warnings

Mid-semester grades brought
109 students greetings from the
Dean of Students Office in the
form of academic warnings.

The warnings are. issued at
each mid-semester and at the
completion of every semester
and are sent to all students
failing to receive credit for 12
semester hours and 12 quality
points.

The warnings, in the form of
letters from the Dean's office,
notify the student that his aca,
demic work is unsatisfactory
and that he must report to the
Dean's Office for counseling.

The total consisted of 49 fresh-
men, 23 sophomores, 22 juniors
and 15 seniors. For second se-
mester 1964-65, 142 students re-
ceived the warning, Richard C.
Burts, dean of students, said this
week.

“The main purpose of the
warnings is to create a dialogue
between the student and this of-
fice,” Burts said. “Where the
old academic probation, used
up until] last year, had teeth in
it, the new system has no re-
strictions,”’ the dean pointed out.

“However,” he continued, *‘the
new system does provide that
adidtional action can be im-
posed beyond the counseling
stage. Though this ‘action’ has
never been taken, we may re-
sort to it in the case of repeat-
ers,”

Burts said the action could
be flexible and, if used. would
be adjusted to the individual
case.

The dean noted that in the
case of the sophomore, junior
and senior classes, the number
of repeaters receiving a pre-
vious warning decreases with
the higher classes.

“While all but two of the soph-
omores receiving warning were
warned at some time last year,”
Burts pointed out, “only two
seniors on the list received ‘

ee Nt

warnings last year."

“A lot of the sophomores still
haven't gotten over the hump.
But as they stay in school, stu-
dents either catch on to the hang
of things or they weed them-
selyes out," Burts conjectured.
“By the time a student gets
to be a senior, he has usually
done something about his
grades.”

He noted that several seniors
who had received warnings fail-
ed to receive mid-semester
grades in seminar courses, thus
preventing them from receiving
the required 12 semester hours
credit.

“T'm encouraged,”’ Burts said,
“that most of the students re-
ceiving the warnings show no
significant tack of hours or qual-
ity points. Almost all are very
near the cutoff point.”

dorm rush was held Tuesday.

The remaining rush parties
will each be one hour in Jength,
with three parties being held
each of the two Sunday after-
noons from 2 until 5 p.m. Re-
dates for these parties, the only
ones for which redates were
necessary, have already been is-
sued by the fraternities and ac-
cepted by the freshmen.

Upperclassmen will return to
the old practice of walking fresh-
men from the dorms to the fra-
ternity court for the first party
and then returning them to the
dorms following the final party
each day.

Bids must be accepted by the
freshmen during the Christmas
vacation. Freshmen will mail
their acceptances to the Inter-
fraternity Council representative
of the fraternity which they
pledge.

A list of IFC representatives
and their addresses will be mail-
ed to each freshman along with
his bids. Acceptances must be
postmarked before the end of
the Christmas vacation.

In appraising the rush system
at this stage from a freshman's
viewpoint, Bayard Miller, presi-
dent of the Freshman Council,
said he felt the rush was ‘‘too
long. too dragged out.”

He wished that the rush could
have been ‘‘started earlier and
finished more quickly.” How-
ever, he said there was still!

Rush Climax Awaited

“exceptional enthusiasm"
among the freshmen toward
rush and joining fraternities.

From the fraternity man's
point of view, Dave Perrin, Sig-
ma Chi representative to the
IFC, said that he believed rush
“was going pretty well consider-
ing the system within which it
was being conducted.” He felt
there is too much restriction on
contact between freshmen and
upperclassmen.

Fabulous Five Sef
| For Combo Party

A post-game combo party
featuring the Fabulous Five
will be held tomorrow night
from 10:30 until 2:30 in the
basement of Chambers

Sponsored by the Social
Council, the party will high-
light Davidson's first home
basketball game of the season,
against Bucknell.

Social Council President
Dan Campbell indicated that
there would be no unusual at-
tractions at this party but em-
phasized, “The Fabulous Five
will certainly provide excet-
fent entertainment for every-
one.”

He also stated that plans
were underway for the en-
nual College Union Christmas
party Dec. 17.
