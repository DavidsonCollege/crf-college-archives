Religious Limitations

This week the Education Committee of the
Board of Trustees will consider Davidson’s policies
concerning tenure of faculty members. In such
discussions, the issue of the religious requirement for
tenure is bound to be debated.

It is a highly controversial issue. Many faculty
members disagree with the policy but are afraid to
say so publically. College President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. didn‘t.even want to be quoted on the issue.

We find such attitudes perplexing.

The issue at hand is not whether Davidson will
maintain its Christian character. This college is
currently committed to the Christian faith and we
believe Christian principles to be central to the
quality of life on campus.

Instead however, the issue is that the religious
requirement limits the quality of education that
students may receive here. By requiring that tenured
Davidson professors must be ‘‘active members"’ of
the Christian church, the trustees severly limit the
field of quality professors from which this college
may hire.

We can envision a situation in the future where the
college might be forced to hire a second-class man
simply on the basis that no first rate active Christian
professors are available to come here.

This religious limition has other effects as well. It
forces the faculty members to conform to a relition
for the sake of their job. They must profess a faith
which many may not believe in their hearts.

Such hypocrisy will undermine the character of this
college.

In essence we believe this religious limitation is a
failing attempt to artifically support the Christian
faith here. A strong and true faith is not destroyed by
a few objections: rather such intelligent con-
sideration of a faith should strengthen the Christian
convictions of the students here. This college is
violating the principles of its own purpose by en-
forcing religious conformity among its faculty.

Certainly the administration can strive to hire ac-
tive members of the Christian church. and by in large
we encourage them to do so. But to maintain an am-
biguous rule arbitrarily enforced on the faculty of this
college will ultimately undermine what religious
spirit that still exists on campus.

We hope that the Education Committee will recom-
mend to the board this fall. that the religious
limitation on tenured professors be dropped.

Such an act will not weaken Davidson's Christian
commitment but strengthen it.

A Good Thing

_ Last year Davidson instituted a new system of
judicial procedure regarding student conduct which is
based on flexibility and right of appeal.

The plan is basically good. and it is working well.
But the system presents Davidson with some real
questions and some potential problems.

The system is tied to the personality of a par-
ticular dean. and based,on the synthesis of his dual
position as counselor and disciplinarian.

Will Terry has handled the situation well as he was
expected to do when it was put into operation. But
someone else might not react so well to the ad-
mittedly difficult dual role. and the students and ad-
ministration cannot sit back forever and bask in his
personality.

We encourage students to read the Code of Respon-
sibility and its regulations. In interviews this week
some had no idea what the Code proscribes. and this
senseless innocence could cause them difficulties in
the future.

Davidson has a guoc thing going. The governance
systvi. so far appears mcderaie. responsibie and
responsive, out college cannot risk the chance of
destroying its good thing through negligence.
ignorance, or unconcern.

Numb Elroy Gets Information
On ‘Der Goot Coolered Volk’

Where do they go, those
people lost to history? Scholar
upon scholar has pondered what
gulf swallows them up, all sear-
ching in vain. Until now. Until
one of my own friends has
joined their ranks.

Not long ago, at the 4 a. m.
pickup. my friend the Masked
Nid (rest easy; you don’t know
him) received a letter stamped
with a green leaf and returned
addressed “‘K.K., Davoidson,
Land of Mystery."’

It informed him that he
hadn't existed for the past year,
that the Great God Iberia had
devoured him and that his self
as a junior was still roaming the
postnight campus in its ec-
toplasmic state.

We. not to say the Masked Nid
himself. or himnoself were
greatly disturbed, even to the
point of making a pilgrimage to
Numb Elroy.

So on September 30.
something of Walpurgisnacht
for Davoidson. which is five
months behind the world ‘or
seven ahead of?), the postnight
crew went suppliant to the Holy
Font. the holy blissful martyr
for to seek.

Numb Elroy was there,
musing over a_ green-bound
tome.Informed of our plight. he
bowed his head. eyes closed and
lips moving almost in-
discernably. his whole body

swaying on the font, vibrating
with the rhythms of a tuneless
threnody.

‘Many,’ he whispered,
“many are the rumblings and
the bumblings of King Kudzu.
Deep is his plotting, and his
vines are long.”

And with an agonizing effort,
he held before us the book,
“Kudzu's Code.” And moaning
the dread incantation of King
Kudzu, he drew the hordes of
Davoidson from the shadows.

This host of our enemy, a list
of missing persons, passed like
specters, beckoning the Masked
Nid to join them.

They had all found refuge in
Davoidson: Marshal Ney,
Judge Crater, The Women's
Auxiliary Pinochle Team of
Atlantis.

King Kudzu had taken them
uncer his leaf.

But chief among them. most
terrible of all, was a man sought
by thousands for nearly 30
years, concentration camp com-
mandant, and Hitler's personal
phrenologist, Herr Rumpstein
Von Tumper.

Now Kudzu's right vine. Tum-
per. slavering with delight.
revealed to us his plan to
cement King Kudzu as Master

of Davoidson!

Tradition in keeping up

Since hazing by up-
perclassmen has withdrawn to
a.most piteous state. there are
no longer treshmen lost in von-
der woods at such ungodly
hours Now. more. sinister
Stratagems are instigated for
freshmen.

These tricks go under the
disguised names ot orientation

harangueded by der Davoidson
S.§.

“If der coolered volk ist to be
happy kleine darkies, dis ac-
tivities, extracurriculum or ud-
dervise, ist got to be shtopped!

‘No more vith dis making der
shtoppings on der campus. Der
coolered volk must remember
dot Verk Means Frreedom!

‘Dey must familiarize der
poleezmen mit vat ist der goot
coolered volk und vat is der bad
coolered volk.

‘‘Der goot coolered volk has got
to be giving der poleezmen der
numbers of der vagons, of der
laundry, of der zocial zecurity,
und of der tooth fillinks.

‘Der goot coolered volk ist to
be vering from now on mit all of
der clothes, purple or ud-
dervise, eine liddle pink vater-
melon, dot der poleezmen may
know vot ist der good coolereds
und vot is ist der bads. In dis
vay. everybody is der happy
happy shtudent.”

Horrified, we covered behind
the fountain. All but our
feartess familial patriarch, Don
Guappo Lasagne. Flicking a
cigarette ash into Von Tum-
per’s breast pocket, Don Guap-
po strode forward with a sneer.

“What's all dis buncha
scallopini? If youse is out for a
peesa de action. youse is gonna
hafta do better den dat!

“Youse is fiddling wit a
minorities group and_= us
minorities groups ain‘t gonna
sit still for dis messin’ around!
Youse is lookin’ to get youse
hedge clipped."

“On der contrary.”’ replied
Tumper. ‘Tomorrow. ve begin
registration of all shtudents of
Italian. Polish. Israeli, und
Melanesian extraction.

“It iss all for der-own goot, zo
dot dey may haff eine happy
Davoidson.”’ .

And. whistling 'Kin-
dertotenlieder."’ he turned back
towards Chambers. from which
came a rustling of leaves.

But even above the rustling.
came the sound of feet. trom-
ping a path away from Davoid-
son. where the vines could not
reach.

Inflicts Heirloom
Upon Unsuspecting Freshmen

pigeons ‘or something equally
Brotesque’. Even though quite
useless the heirloom is inflicted
upon every coming generation.

The mixer lives on under the
pretense of allowing freshmem
to meet what Queens and Salem
have to olfer Fair, young
‘virgin’ | maidens, treshly shorn
from mother’s apron come with
new found hopes in their heads.

They meet and talk. Sallv
plays the flute. Bertha likes to
eat. Tom is pre-med. (Oh')
Dick is pre-law. Oh') Harry is
per-verted What! Oh what
sweet inspiration there is in the
human voice!

The area behind Richards
House seems to be God's chosen
site tor all outdoor eating ex-
periences. It is here that the
birds and bees are quite visible
tor any who dare to look.

The conversation, during the
course of the meal, through
periods of intense silence which
are tollowed by spasms of

violent eruptions.

“Is it true that they burn wit-
ches at Salem?” Do Davidson
bovs have more fun?" “Boys.

Where's a boy?”

The dance serves the lofty
purpose ot giving the freshmen
something to do with their frien-
ds. Coke is served for those who
think they can handle it.

If not. there is also beer.
When the elock strikes the--
twelfth hour the little prin-
cesses must tear themselves
from prince charming. David-
son reverts to its original pur-
pose. an institution of higher
learning ‘or so one hears).

All said. however. the mixer
serves its purpose. It is indeed
sad that such a purpose is not
manitest to any save a few ar-
chivists. Perhaps with the
coming of coeducation al
Davidson. the Davidson Mixer
will find its true place of honor.
Until then
