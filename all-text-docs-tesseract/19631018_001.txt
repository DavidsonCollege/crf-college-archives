YMCA Fund Campaign
Nets $2,600 In Drive

BY HARRY CARR

More than $2,600 in student contributions and pledges is the result of the 1963
fund raising campaign of the Davidson YMCA. it was announced this week.

Faculty donations and offer-
ings from the vesper services
will add about another $1,000 to
the funds of the YMCA, accord-
ing to President Joe Howell, Al-
though the final figure will still
be far below the anticipated
$4,500 Howell expressed the
hope that the organization can
still carry out its projects ef-
ficiently.

At the present time, the Great
Issues Program is the service
club's largest project. Of the six
scheduled speakers on “Emerg-
ing Africa,” three have already
made appearances on the cam-
pus.

Other speakers for the near

- future include; David D. New-
som, deputy director in the of-
fice of North African affairs at
the State Department; Godrey
K. J. Amachree. under secre-
tary of the U.N. Department of
Trusteeship for Non-Self Gov-
erning Nation; and the David-
son Valedictorian of the class of
1960, David W. Robinson, Jr..
who has spent the last two years
in Senega! after graduate work
at Union Theological Seminary,
New York.

The YMCA will present its
Book of the Year lecturer
shortly after Thanksgiving
this year. Although there has
been no report of the identity
of the scheduled spesker, the
group hes definitely signed an
author.

Under the direction of Steve

David Names Staff
Of ‘Cat Handbook

Roger David, newly-elected
editor of the 1964-65 Wildcat
Handbook, filled the major posts
on next year’s handbook staff
Wednesday in announcing his
appointments.

David, who won the election
for the editorship on Monday
over Ed Stopher by a narrow
margin of 199-192, is a pre-
medical student and a member
of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.

The new staff includes busi-
ness manager, Bob Bryan; asso- |
ciate editor, Dave Orr; and
sports editor, Danny Boone, with
Jennings Bryant, Alan Johnson, |
Ernie Larkin and Jim McQueen
serving as section editors. Bil)
Council completes the staff ap-:
pointments as an assistant to the |
business manager. ~

David said in an interview,
“I would welcome any sugges-
tions from the student body for
additions to the new book, and
also criticisms concerning what
they liked and did not like about :
last year’s handbook.” David
said that he had already written i
several schools for copies of |
their handbooks, so that the best |
aspects of these books might be—
incorporated in ours.

David also announced that;
some minor positions on the:
handbook staff were still open’
to any interested students and
urged those students to contact
him as soon as possible.

“The section editors have not
yet been assigned specific see-|
tions,” David said. This will be
done in the near future when

David was elected.

Ramsburgh, the community serv-
ices committee is sponsoring a

taking of the Y members this
year. Already in progress, the
canteen for colored students
takes place every Friday night

planning stages, the white can-
teen will go into action soon,
according to Howell.

Also in the planning are the
coaching of wrestling at Tor-
rence-Lytle School and an activi-
ties period for children at the
Ada Jenkins School for four or

The official program will be-
gin tonight with a Wind Ensem-
ble concert in. Hodson Hall to
be followed by a coffee hour for
the parents and. the Ensemble
in the Stowe. Art Galleries.

Saturday morning’s activities
include registration. a coffee in
the Student Union, tours of the
campus conducted by members
of the Freshman Class and visi-
tations of dormitories, the ROTC
Department and selected classes.

From noon until 1:15 p.m.
a luncheon will be served for
the freshmen and their par-
ents in the Banquet Room of
Chambers. Following this, an,
assembly in Chambers Audi-
torium will be held. °

Ben Reeves, acting chairman
of the Freshman Council, will
serve as master of ceremonies,
while Chaplain Will Terry, Dean

assembly. Music will be provided

uebec-Cuba Peace Walk
Shows Beliefs -- And Fears

BY TOM |.OFLIN

They are a group walking, they hope, to Cuba. And every mile they tread is step-
ped with the phantom companion terror.

Because they could speak
freely here, 10 of the more than
20 members of the Committee
for Nonviolent Action’s Quebec-
to-Guantanamo Walk sat on a
stage in the College Union Mon-
day night and looked out over
stoney-faced Cubans and skep-
tical students.

They did not attempt to con-
vey their escort, fear, to the
audience; and yet it was with
them the whole time that they
spoke words of peace in a
world with none.

The 10 came from all walks of
life; there were men and boys
and girls. All had two things in
common: the deep conviction
that peace is the only answer
for mankind and the apprehen-
sion that they would not pub-
licly admit.

In the words of Marvin David-
ov, their official spokesman that
night, the overall objectives of
the CNVA is “for each nation
to unilaterally disarm, for al)
peoples to resist their military
leaders and for every nation to
adopt a policy of nonviolent ac-
tion to defend its interests.”

Their desire, then, as publicly
stated. is for the dove to fly
over the world; their walk..

which originated in Quebec, is
designed to gain the true story
in Cuba while attempting to
persuade the Castroites by
marching from Havana to Guan-
tanamo to send the Russians
home and live in harmony with
this country. And they also want
the United States to live in
peace with Cuba—Castro’s Cuba.
Castro’s representatives have
assured them they will be wel-
come.

Their leader, Brad Little, the
man who organized the walk
relying on experience gleaned
from a similar march he organ-
ized and carried out through
East Germany, Poland and Rus-
sia, is a picture of contrasts.

He did not appear particularly
peaceful in the question-and-
answer period Monday night; he
repeatedly spoke sarcastically
and sharply to various ques-
tioners éspecially Cubans hav:
ing trouble with the language.

But Little was all for friend-
ship to prevail among nations.
Jt may have been that he was
merely trying to illustrate that
without an attempt on the part
of people to have harmonious
relations with one another. there

can be no peace.

To the question: “Are you

‘politically ehead of your
time?” he answered, “Obvious-
ly.”

Davidov explained how he
thought the ONVA, through
such maneuvers as walks. could
help the world move closer to
peace: “By our walks and exam-
ples of civil disobedience, we
effect the cheapest advertising
possible. We hope to start peo-
ple to thinking and then acting
for peace.”

A humbler member of the
walk, Ken Meister, explained
why he is so passionately de-
voted to the committee. “I
think our committee can help
reduce tension in this coun-
try. Through our marches and
literature, | think we made
the people of this country.
more conscious of peace,” he
said, “and thus helped the
test ban treaty pass by as big
a margin as it did in the Sen-
ate.”

When it was suggested that
the committee might not’ suc-
ceed in its goals of creating
more good-will in the U.S. for
our énemies, Little did an ob-
viously unusual thing for a man
with his betiefs—he grew an-
gry.

“Of course we'll succeed.” he
snapped. “Our idea of nonvio-
lence has already taken hold in
the world. It’s a growing philo-

school communicate, a sounding
