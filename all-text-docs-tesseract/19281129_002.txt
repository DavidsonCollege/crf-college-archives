THANKSGIVING DAY
Thanksgiving Day is with us
rey
again. The day of thankfulness to

our Creator for the many blessings
that have been bestowed upon us.
Yet how many really pause to give
thanks for their benefits? A few.
Yes. Is this due to ingratitude?
Probably not. A more logical cause
is, negligence and _ forgetfulness’
We, in our hurry and materialism,
forget the purpose of the original
Thanksgiving, or if we do think of
it, give to it only a passing thought
and hope that someone else gives the
thanks that are due. Even though
the very spirit of Thanksgiving has
changed, we should not forget the
origin of its being. How, over three
hundred years ago on the bleak and
dreary coast of New England, a
group of weary Puritans gathered
together and, in the midst of hunger,
cold, disease, and discouragement,
found time to set aside a day to give
thanks to God for His mercy. It
took men and women with strong
wills to carry on through the first
hard years of work and then give
thanks to the Lord for His kindness.
It took men and women with iron
constitutions to stand. the hardships
of those times and then to praise the
Maker for letting them get away
from the softness of old England.
Among these people was the first
Thanksgiving.

The program for the day then was
simple—contests, feasts, and church
services, and then the day was over.
How different is our day. It is true
that we still have the contests, but
the Puritans did not have thousands
of people in stadiums cheering men
that they only know by reputation.
Yes, we still have the feasts, but not
a simple meal of home-grown prod-
ucts, but an elaborate dinner whose
ingredients are-gathered from—all
over the United States. We still
have the church services, hut how
many people attend in their hurry to
get off to the big game? We still
have the same elements in our
Thanksgiving as did the early Puri-
tans, but our proportion of them has
changed. In the olden times, the
church services and the thanks to
God were the main elements, but in
our day the main and preponderent
element is the football game.

We do not advocate the abolish-
ment of the new Thanksgiving.
Times have changed too much.
Neither have we any fight with foot-
hall, but we call for a more religious
amendment to our Thanksgiving. A
Thanksgiving when more thanks
shall be given to our Lord than to the
coach who turns out a winning team,
Far too few people attend the
usual Thanksgiving services of the
churches, far too few pause, in their
hurry to fill the holiday with some-
. thing, to give thanks to the Divine
_ Being who is the founder of this na-
tion of ours. “ORE J.

CONSIDER THE DEBATER

While literary societies at David-
son gasp for breath the Forensic
Council announces that it has be-
come a member of the Dixie Debat-
ing League. Intercollegiate debat-
ing, in spite of its many rivals in the
fields of athletics, journalism, and
scores of other extracurricula activi-
ties, has become important enough
for organization.

The most exacting work in extra-
curricula activities at Davidson is the
lot of the varsity debater. Although
the period of preparation does not
extend over quite the length of time
as does the season of any one of the
major sports, it is far more concen-
trated when it does last. Athletic
training, although involving an ele-
ment of work, has much of the spirit
of play in its process, and no great
amount of other recreation is needed
in the day’s program. There is no
such spirit of play in the preparation
of debate; hence recreation must be
taken outside of time used for re-
search and for performing the aca-
demic duties as well.

A place on the debating team
therefore comes as an expensive op-
portunity for development and hon-
or. The debater, if he contends on
home ground, must meet classes even
on the day of, and on the day after,
the engagement. There must then
he some great neglect of one part of
the day's program: either recreation
or preparatoion of debate or class-
room work must be sacrificed.

Debate has a great intrinsic value.

It breeds a» wholesome regard for
truth and facts; it demands a high
degree of accuracy and exactness; it
broadens the point of view more
than anything else can do; it makes
the person come to the realization
that “all finalities are lies, including
this one ;” in presentation it demands
a great understanding of human na-
ture and psychological. laws. Jn toto,
the process of debate fulfills more
nearly all the requirements of .edu-
cation than any other college fune-
tion,
In view of such facts it seems evi-
dent that debate demands more ree-
ognition from the administration
than it now gets. If nothong else
were done, it would go a great way
to provide for a better debating pro-
gram, to excuse each varsity debater
from preparation for classes for a
week preceding the debate.

THE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT

Charles Franklin

Thwing, in the
current /lorld’se Work, is more

than generous in his praise of college
students generally. He covers the
field from end to end and finds in
every respect, an improvement in the
type since, say, 1878.

An interesting fact which he calls
to the attention is an evident one.
“The increase in the number of in-
dividuals in Dr,
Thwing, “is accompanied by a de-
crease on the number of individ-
ualisms. Similarities are more
abounding in the present college
group than are eccentricities.”

Recent surveys by fashion experts
hear out this statement as they re-
port uniform changes in the matter
of dress from the slouchy tendency
of recent years to a tidiness and care
formerly unknown. This is a true
symbol of the uniformity which is
the rule of the campus.

college,” says

Another point in common among
students is the care which is taken
to shun superiority and at the same
time, inferiority. There is no desire
to be above the average college man,
but rather to be typical and “regu-
lar.”

Here is a personality strangely
foreign to the college of a decade
ago; an entirely different being; a
pattern, so to speak, cut in the form
of the true and the average college
person; and yet, a being possessing
a quality differing from those of the
“old grad.” He is a social demo-

crat.

Followers of the gridiron saw a good

no possible way of getting from Charl-

CONTEMPORARY
THOUGHT

BE SOBER AND MISTRUST-
FULL

McGill Daily: A certain laboratory at
McGill University preaches a sermon in
eleven words to whomsoever enters its
doors. For there, painted in unassuming
black letters on the wall above one of the
tables, are the words, “Be sober and mis-
trustful; these are the sinews of the un-
derstanding.”

It seems ‘almost unnecessary to com-
ment on a sentence like that. Breath-
taking in their significance, the words
come out of the past, like a dash of cold

water in the face of complacent cred-
ulity.
How often have we seen students

thrown into an intellectual panic on hear-
ing two professors teaching completely
divergent views upon the same, subject.
“Which are we to believe?” they. ask in
an aggrieved tone of voice. It probably
never enters their minds that it might be
disbelieve both, to soberly
weigh the evidence themselves, and then
to form an opinion of their own. unlike
cither of those proposed. Students are
not required to believe all they are told.
The professor who has stimulated his
class to think for themselves has done a
mightier deed than one who has merely
poured into their all-believing ears a mass
of informatoion colored by his own per-
sonal opinion, Just because a professor
swears by a certain poet, is no reason why
the student should not think that same
poet assinine and insipid. Nor do the
professors expect otherwise. They want
their students to think—not to hold their
mouths open like a nestful of birds, wait-
ing for providence, or some other inter-
ested person, to send a worm,

But the ancient physician who bequeath-
such advice did not advocate

opposite extreme, the “doubting
Thomas” attitude. Everyone is familiar
with the man who cannot be told any-
thing. He considers an opinion unlike his
own as worthless, and refuses to believe
that there may be something, after all, in
what the other fellow says. He is mis-
trustful of other opinions, but his mistrust
does not onclude the
conclusions.

We must, then, be soberly mistrustiul
even of our own opinions and prejudices.

ing.”

To the Editor of The Davidsonian :

Sir: In the last week’s issue of, The
Davidsonian there appeared an artidle in
the open forum column which seemed to
me, inane, to say the least. It was that
in which it was suggested hat the Senior
class gift be in the form of a flag, to re-
place the traditional old relic which now
flaps in tatters from the pole near Shearer.

It is my opinion that only such a de-
crepit old rag. would be in taste on a
campus which has for its sole chapel, such
a one as Shearer; which numbers athong
its dormitories, “The Barracks,” and
which houses its Physics and Biology de-
partments on such a splendid pile of
scrap-wood as is the “Temporary” build-
ing. |
I will confess that the idea of offering
a course of instruction in War at all at
Davidson, has always seemed rather in-
congruous to me. If there were no War
department here, there would neither be

that remnant of a flag which now beats
the breeze, on our campus.

It is an ancient and age-old custom, this
Thanksgiving. In the olden days, folks
gathered around Thanksgiving Day, ate,
drank, and enumerated the many things
for which they were thankful. Now, in
this modern regime, folks eat a hurried
dinner, gather together in the stadium on
their team’s side of the field, drink, and
are thankful—provided their side is win-
ning.

Contrary to custom, we wish to enum-
erate some things which we will be thank-
ful for after Thanksgiving. These are
all with the proviso that what we hope for

| will come true.

1. We will be thankful that the Wild-
cats frocked (a word used in substitute

VIEWS AND REVIEWS

By Chatham Clark

=

It is with a spirit of reverence and ap-
preciation that we read “Blades,” the last

ot thirty outstanding novels by George

Barr McCutcheon. We remember him as

the author of the Graustark books, as

well as many interesting novelettes. Some
one has justly called him “The King of
Story Tellers,” and in this last novel he
has proven himself even more deserved of
this title.

The book derives its name from that of
its hero, Jasper Elias Bernadotte Blades,
otherwise known as “Barnaby” “The
Barnacle,” because he stuck like a leech
you simply couldn't shake him off. This

or

was evident on the football team, and in |

his valorous war record.

On his return from France he was one
of the few that did not think the world
owed him a living for having fought in
defense of so noble a cause. In the busi-
ness world he did not prove a success, but
in social affairs he was constantly in de-
mand. This steady strain on his pocket-
book led him to investigate the estate left
by his great uncle, Prime Dimmesdale,
who when quite a young man gave up his
home in New York to join a “Company of
Ghosts,” thus retiring to a secluded spot

|

And lastly, the idea of having I the
Senior’’class keep the college in flags,
with their Senior class gifts, is prepos-
terous. If the Seniors want to give a
class gift they should give one, and if
not, why suggest that they should offer
as their parting gift awhandful of tooth-
picks to the biggest eater—or something

equally as tasty as that?

in Canada, completely out of touch with
the surrounding world.

The first task for Blades was to estab-
lish the fact that,the was really the grand
nephew of Prime Dimmesdale. Second,
to live among this “Company of Ghosts”
for a trial period of three months. | He
readily established his claims and set out
to oinvestigate this remote spot, but not
without some slight apprehension.

After several days of travel, mostly on
foot, he arrived at the little town, New
Scrooby, which was to be his home for
three months. This town was one ex-
actly as would be found among the pages
of “Pilgrim's Progress.” Completely a
where such acient
custom as punishment in the stocks, and

| the night watch were still is existence.

The village contained forty small houses
and a church where the church officer still
went the rounds with his staff prodding its
members to keep them awake. The Barn-
aby Blades of old learned to love this
place and consider its inhabitants his peo-
ple. His period of trial was extended to
six months in order to give him time to
accustom himself to the life, and arrive at
a definite decision. During this time he
fell in love with beautiful Cynthia Stand-
ish, which in the end turns out as one
would expect it to, completing a beauti-

| ful love story.

He was called the “Barnacle” because it
was not in him to let go of a thing, but
after six months he gave up the name for
Jasper, for in so doing he relinquished all
claims to his former life and for the first
‘time found himself.
