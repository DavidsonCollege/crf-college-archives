Big High School Track ©
Carnival to be Held at
Davidson During March

March 19th Set as Date For Inter-
School Meet

THIRD ANNUAL MEET

Invitations Are Sent Out to Leading |
Secondary Schools—Competition |
Will Be Keen |

March 19th has been set by Coach Tex
Tilson as the time for the high school track |
carnival, which is staged annually at David-
son, at which time the high schools of the
state are given an invitation to participate,
a cup being awarded to the winner. No an-
nouncement has yet been made as to who will
donate the trophy this year.

The idea of the carnival was instituted at
Davidson in the spring of 1925, and the two
that have already been staged were a success.
Interest in this affair is gradually growing,
as seen by the number of high schools which
sent representatives last year. The object
is to develop a spirit of friendly rivalry be-
tween the track squads of the state high |
schools, and prepare them for the state mect
at Chapel Hill each year.

Competition is keen between several of
the high schools, and the participation of the
Davidson freshman track squad lends interest
to the affair. The Wildkittens are ineligible
to win the cup, this always going to a high
school. Charlotte, which has had a crack

Special effort is going to be made this year
by local officials to get a number of high
schools who heretofore have not taken part,
to send men. [Even if a school can not send
but a few men, they will be urged to have
them on hand, to make the affair more
closely contested.

Forester Wheeler

Last Monday morning Mr. Wheeler, State
Forester of North Carolina, gave a very in-
teresting lecture to the student body on the
general subject of forestry. Mr. Wheeler
has been in the forestry service for about 17
years, and during that time has acquired an
unusual knowledge and tlie

The Veenbeaal Giiidines Institute
to Give Lectures to Undecided Men

The College Y. M. C. A., under the direc-
tion of Secretary Jim Appleby, has made
plans this spring for possibly its greatest
piece of work yet undertaken, and one which
will undoubtedly be of wonderful benefit art
acceptability to the students. This plan calls
for a Vocational Guidance Institute, some-
thing which has never been tried in the South
to any appreciable extent. This institute,
sponsored by the Y. M. C. A. but conducted
by leading professional men of the State and
South, will begin the second week of Feb-
ruary and will continue, as is planned at pres-
ent, for five or six successive weeks. The
Y. M.C. A, realizes the fact that every year
many men are going out from Davidson
without having any preferred vocation in
view, and to help decrease, by means of
life-work conferences and studies, the per-
centage of such men causing such a condition,
the Y. M. C. A. will initiate this Vocational
Guidance Institute.

It is somewhat striking and astonishing
just what per cent of college graduates enter
into the world with no definite life work to
undertake. Davidson’s graduates and stu-
dents are no exception to this per cent of
“undecided.” So to the men here in college,
as yet undecided, the Vocational Guidance
Institute will be of especial interest and
help. It is quite impossible to devote time
and talent to every single profession and
career chosen by students, and so only those
vocations for which the great majority of
Davidson students are interested in and are
preparing for will be placed in the curricu-
lum of this institute.

Every Wednesday night for five or six
successive weeks some noted man in some
particular vocation will be here to present a
vocation in a very informal, way. The stu-
dents will hear first-hand knowledge of some

particular vocation at each time. Nothing

inspirational will be presented, only the real
truth and facts of each vocation. Facts and
statistics relative to graduate work, problems
met in that vocation, its opportunities, its de-
velopment, its merits and faults—all will be
given. In other words, an absolutely fair and
just insight into a vocation given in a prac-
tical way by one who kriows will be the
offering for Davidson students. In addition,
during the week which is turned over to a
certain vocational study, the Y. M. C. A. will
have in its room exhibits of all kinds of
books and catalogues as to choosing one’s

life work, and especially relative to that one |

vocation before the students each week.

To these lectures all students will be in-
vited, but particularly those who have chosen
as their life work the vocation under dis-
cussion, and those students as yet undecided
These lectures are only for students, and it
is hoped by the Y. M. C. A. that they will
be well attended and much benefit gained,
thus proving the institute a success.

Medicine will be the first vocation in the
curriculum. Dr. James M. Northington, of
Charlotte,, who is editor of the “Southern
Medical and: Surgical Journal,” will present
his profesion to the students. Dr. Northing-
ton is of great prominence. in the medical
fraternity, and because of his position and
experience, and, incidentally, his interest in
and nearness to Davidson boys, the Y. M. C.
A. Board could certainly have chosen no
more capable man. He will give the whole
course of a medical life and its requirements,
couching upon the required four years’ post-
graduate work and the two years’ interne
duty, and then proceeding deeper into the
possibilities and scope of its practice.

The second week will be devoted to teach-
ing as a profession. Dr. M. C. S. Noble,
Jr., last year Professor of Education and

The Southern Bell Telephone and Tele-

nouncement from the company’s bureau of
jemployment and training.

Mr. Kendall Weisiger, head of the tele
phone company’s bureau of employment and
training, will arrive in Davidson on Thurs-
| day afternoon, February 3rd, and will speak
to the interested members of the Senior class,
outlining for them the opportunities offered
by his company. Announcement of the exact
time and place of this interview will be made
at an early date.

Five members of last year’s Senior class,
O. L. Brenner, H. Y. Alexander, H. L.
Vance, N. R. McLeod and L. B. Huie,

and university graduates by the telephone
|company last summer, and upon completion
| of their preliminary training were given as-

according to a_ recent

ene

-|signments in the various fields in which the

|company operates.

Mr. Weisiger’s visit this year is of greater
|than ordinary significance since he brings
with him Col. R. T. Rees, of New York City,
who is director of employment and training
for the entire Bell Telephone system, insofar
'as college students are concerned. Colonel
| Rees was until recently connected with the
| general staff of the U. S. Army, and during
|the war he was responsible for all relations
| between the War Department and the col-
|legess of the nation. He is now a member
of the Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education, and is a member of the
committee which has direction of the three-
year survey, now being made in this country
and abroad with a view to improving engi-
neering education in America.

Members of the Senior class, interested in

Bible lands from Ur of the Chaldees
to Rome, and from Greece to Egypt.
He will conduct services at the church

During the past two Sundays, the Y. M.

A. was especially fortunate in the secur-
ing of speakers to address the students. On
January 23rd, Prof. J. C. Bailey, of the Da
vidson faculty, addressed the for
the first time since he has been on the college

Professor Bailey chose as his text Prov.
4:18, “The path of the just is as the shining
light that shineth more and more unto the
perfect day.” At the opening of his speech,
he illustrated his text by giving an example
of a citizen enlisting in the army. ‘“Techni-
cally and legally he is a soldier. Yet he
not what we consider as a soldier just as a
man that draws a football uniform is not a
football player. However, what is the dif-
ference between the recruit ‘and the soldier ?
The soldier has lived the life of the army
and has developed the spirit and attitude of
the soldier. He is not developed over night
by signing papers. He is the outgrowth of
living a certain kind of life.”

The speaker then made the Christian life
analogous to this illustration. He pointed out
that an enlisted man and a man that has just
joined the church are both raw material, and
both are different from the trained men, The
old regular has certain attributes that tell
you his mode of life. He has the spirit of
obedience and patriotism and will do what he
is instructed to at the proper time. These.
| Christian characteristics are the result of a
Mong training in the life of the Christian.
Suppose the man after he had enlisted tried
\to’return to his former mode of living? He
| would possess none of the Christian’s marks.
In the conclusion of his speech, Professor
| Bailey summarized the attributes that are
