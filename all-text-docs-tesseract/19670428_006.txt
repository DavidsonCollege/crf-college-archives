New Education Program
Reaps Good Response

The student-led Educational
Planning Program for high
schools has been a tremendous
success this year. according to
the student organizer for the
program, Tom Earnhardt.

Earnhardt, commenting on the
first yéar of the new program.
said that the results had been
“very gratifying.”

“Everywhere we went,” he
said. ‘“‘we received tremendous
audience response.”

The program, which is de
signed to inform college bound
high-schoolers on the problems
and advantages of a college ca.
reer, is the product of the care
ful preparation of Director of
Admission H. Edmunds White.

Its first trial came early in
the school year as three-man
student teams visited high
schools in North Carolina. After
a tremendous initial response
from these schools, the program
was. expanded. At the beginning
of the second semester letters
of information about the pro-
gram were sent out to schools
all over the South.

“We feel fortunate to have
been invited to as many fine
schools as we were on such
short notice.” said Earnhardt.

Since that time, the’ four
groups have visited high schools
as far south as southern Flor-
ida, as far north as Washington.
D. C.. and as far west as Little
Rock. Ark. The groups’ travels
have taken them over a com-

playwright developed his ar-
tistie credo. Green began his
talk with -this credo.

“I believe that there is a
principal impetus in mankind
toward the creation of a truly
beautiful world,"' he said.

“The fine arts are the fire
and fervor of life. ‘and this
creative impetus, despite its
misuses. still stirs within us.

“The creation of these arts
challenges the best in man,

years he spent in Hollywood
writing screenplays for such
movies as ‘State Fair.”

Green described the anguish
he felt as he saw ‘‘our people
betrayed" by motion picture
producers who ‘‘sold out" ar-
tistic interests for the sake of
profit, exploiting ‘‘cheap sex,
violence and corruption.”

As an example of this prac-
tice. Green related an experi-
ence which occurred while he
was serving in Japan as Asi-

but no nation comes of age
until they are developed.”
Green continued.

In his narrative, Green ex

When his Guggenheim Fel-

Academy of Arts and Letters.

Ammons’ informal but com-
pelling reading of his poems
drew an attentive crowd in Eu
Hall Wednesday night. He dis-
eussed the ethnic background
required to write poetry. “Ev

ground is necessary to ground

ence to write from.”

good of mankind.

It was then that he first con-
ceived the idea of the outdoor
drama, which led to the open-
ing in 1937 of the amphitheater
at Manteo where Green’s The
Lost Cofony is still performed
annually.

Other dramas soon followed,
and now permanent outdoor
theaters can be found around
the nation.

In closing, Green expressed
the hope that these theaters
and plays. aimed primarily at
preserving the national herit-
age, would be looked upon as
“*memorials to those who add-
ed to life’’ — America’s relig.
fous and historic pioneers.

Examples of outdoor drama
are Unto These Hills, perform-
ed regularly at Cherokee. N.
C.. and Horn in the West, at
Boone.

Green’s_ talk was supple-
mented with slides and com-
mentary by Mark Sumner. di-
rector of the Institute of Out-
door Drama at UNC. Sumner
has worked closely with Green
in producing several works.
His slides presented various
amphitheaters and productions
which can be seen throughout
the country.

Green's lecture was the sec-
ond of three in the series of
Reynolds Lectures. which con-
cludes with the visit of sci-
entist Dr. Jacob Bronowski on
May 9.

The Reynolds Lectureship
Fund was established in 1959
through the resources of the Z.
Smith Reynolds Foundation.
The fund provides for an an-
nual series of distinguished
guest authorities in the human-
ities, sciences, arts and philos-
ophy.

Normally, the lecturer will
spend several days at David-
son, presenting both formal
and informal talks, and some-
times discussing with students
various problems in some par-
ticular field of study.

POETRY, POLITICS AND LIFE

nile.

Spender Draws From His Experiences

Spender: Economic Decay
Produces Revolutions, War

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

Economie decay produced
revolutions such as Nazism
and Fascism in the Thirties,
and a world war, according to
British poet Stephen Spender.

Spender. who is co-editor of
Encounter, spent two days on
campus this week discussing
poetry, politics and life in the
Thirties.

The poet, whose visit here
was sponsored by Beta Theta
Pi fraternity, addressed the
student body Wednesday at
chapel.

Drawing from his reflections
and experiences as both an ob-
server and as a participant in
the political affairs of the pe-
riod, he chronicled the rise of
revolutionary movements, and
the ensuing war.

The 58-year-old poet com-
mented that the economic
breakdown in 1929 ‘‘amounted
to a collapse of the whole so-
ciety.”’ He continued, saying
“that the collapse led to a pe-
riod during which people, as
consumers, were forced into
buying goods when they could
not afford them.”

“The economv was suffer-
ing.” said Spender. ‘and need-
ed some type of reconstruc-
tion. The,gsvstem became de-
pendent, as is natural, on an
expensive proposition, that of
war.”

Speaking of Nazism and
Fascism, he proposed that

Nazism is not “just a revolu-
tion.”

He said that it had some
special features, such as op-
position to all intellectual free-
dom, a program of suppres-
sion of literacy and a type of

totalitarian dictatorship.

Spender said that the concept
of totalitarianism ‘inherent in
Nazism was the reason that
this movement was so terrify-
ing.

‘It meant,”’ Spendér contin-
ued. “that anyone who gave
any opposition could be im-
mediately removed.’

In calling Nazism ‘‘an ex-
tremely wicked system.” he
said that “wickedness usual-
ly produces martyrs, but Naz-
ism eliminated martyrdom by
completely removing and for-
getting the possible martyrs.”

Spender referred to the pe:
riod of Nazi domination of Eu-
rope as a “nightmarish period
of modern society”

In his ‘short address, Spen-
der demonstrated the compar-
atively small change in the po.
litical systems of the Thirties
and the present day. He said
that the suppression of oppo-
sition in Russia in 1967 is much
the same as it has been for
the last 50 years.

The ELK’S Now Operated Under New Management

Tuesday afternoon and eve-
ning Spender met with stu-
dents to read and comment on
both his poetry and the poetry
of other writers of this cen-
tury.

He visited classes on Tues-
day afternoon. During this
time he reviewed his works
and commented on modern po.
etry. In speaking on modern
poetry, he said that he favor-
ed modetn American poetry
over the English product but
went on to say that ‘‘one has
the feeling of waiting for
something much more inter-
esting.”

Tuesday night Spender en-
tertained a large group of stu-
dents who gathered in Euman-
ean Hall to hear him read his
own works. The reading cen-
tered around a comparison of
his works during his under-
graduate days in London and
some of his later composi-
tions.

In commenting on U. S.
wars and economy. past and
present, Spender said that the
war economy of the United
States during the late Thir-
ties was much the same as the
present. This war economy.
according to Spender. is ‘‘ex-
tremely unhealthy, in the
sense that it may break down’
should the war end abruptly."

Davidson was an en route
stop for Spender, who is on his

‘way to Northwestern Univer-

sity where he plans to spend
six weeks as a visiting pro-
fessor.
