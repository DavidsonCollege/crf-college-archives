The Making Of A Dictator

SIX

President Nixon is a strange
dude. He seems to delight in the
unexpected to accomplish his
ends.

The most recent examples of
this are his firing of Archibald
Cox, and his release of the
White House tapes.

We are appalled by the Cox
dismassal, for it represents the
quashing of a credible in-
vestigation, which was in-
dependent of the Justice Depar-
tment, at a time when there
were indications that Cox and
his staff may have uncovered
evidence potentially damaging
to the President.

As for the release of the
tapes, that was obviously the
right course of action; only it
came months too late, after
nearly precipitating one of the
most serious constitutional
crises since the founding of the
Republic.

We find these unexpected
changes in policy to be very
disturbing because they in-
dicate either that Nixon has lost
touch with the beliefs and
viewpoints of the American
citizen, or even that he just
doesn’t care what the average
citizen thinks.

We suspect it is a com-
bination of the two: That Nixon
makes decisions without get-
ting significant input from
anyone outside a group of in-
timate advisors, who them-
selves seem to know little about
what Americans think; and
that the feelings of our citizens
are only of secondary im-
portance anyway (We can't
possibly know what is best sin-
ce we are not as informed as
Nixon! ?!)

Since there are no laws
against a President making his
own decisions in any way he
sees fit, this in itself is not
ground for impeachment. It is,

"Seer

however, something that must
be corrected, for the longer
King Richard continues to be
unresponsive to the will of the
people, the more his tenure in
office will turn into the reign of
a dictator.

As for impeachment, we feel
that it would be wise to wait un-
til all the evidence from the
various investigations is in
before making any move.

Until then we can only wait ...
as painful as that may be.

Commitment To Liberal Arts

Most Davidson students
came to this college with an un-
derstanding that an _ ap-
preciation for the liberal a7
would be instilled or further
developed in them.

Yet each year, disconcerted
students grumble their discon-
tent with the area require-
ments, physical education
requirements, and the lack of
academic activities outside the
classroom situation. Not a
small number advocate aban-
doning the physical education
and academic course require-
ments.

Perhaps the reason that
students express opposition to
these requirements is not
because they find themselves in
opposition to a liberal arts
program, but only to the im-
plementation of these
programs at Davidson.

Students find themselves
faced with the inevitability of
taking three courses from each
of the four areas of study. Yet
are there three courses taught
within each area which are
designed with the purpose of in-
troducing the student not
majoring in that area to

thought provoking material

and discussion?

Is there truly an effort to
stimulate study, which, while
not involving the student in
highly detailed material vital
for a major, helps that student
develop an interest in that field
of study?

In the case of the student
majoring in pre-medicine, one
can see a commitment to im-
plement programs in the areas
outside the natural sciences to
enrich that student’s study.
Courses in medical ter-
minology, medical sociology,
and ethics are open to the pre-
medicine major.

Yet one has to examine the
Davidson curriculum intensely
to discover this same effort to
offer meaningful courses in
areas not specifically related to
the student majoring in the
humanities and social sciences.

Chances are, no matter how
intense the investigation, one
finds that the options simply
are not there.

For example, the natural
science ‘‘21 level courses’’ are
notorious as alternatives to
meaningful study or hard work.
The ‘‘31 level courses’’ are
equally notorious for offering
detailed memorization without
much thought.

Somewhere between these
two alternatives, there must be
a place for a professor to teach
enthusiastically, to provoke
thought and study in his
discipline for the benefit of the
non-major. _

If Davidson is to uphold its
tradition of area requirements,
which we strongly feel that it
should, the curriculum must be
reexamined to insure that
students and professors alike
do not face a morning of area
requirement drudgery, but a
challenge to provoke discus-
sion ‘‘in the realm of ideas’’.

Secondly, the gymnasium is
unfortunately not recognized as
a great bastion of enthusiasm
for the liberal arts.

The athletic department of-
ten appears to be too concerned
with coaching varsity sports to
allow the Davidson student a

chance toenrollina P. E. cour-
se.

Moreover, most of the cour-
ses which are taught are con-
veniently scheduled at 9, 10, or
11, the hours during which
students are usually engaged
in academic or other pursuits.

Physical education require-
ments are valid if the em-
phasis is placed on teaching
students sports which they can
not only practice at Davidson,
but pursue after graduation.

We fail to see the value of the
physical education require-
ments if the emphasis is
simply on getting the student
out of the gym area.

And finally, it seems
necessary to ask whether the
Davidson community is going
to condone the scheduling of
classes at 10, an_ hour
specifically designated as an
activities hour.

When a student chooses to
take a course marked on the
registration sheet TBA (to be
announced), that student can
expect to have a class at 10.

And although many
professors may deny that they
have any _ intention of
scheduling a course during the
activities hour when they fail to
designate a time period for
their class, there seems to be a
rather remarkable proclivity to
find that students already have
classes at 8, 9, 11, 12, and 2,
leaving the 10 o’clock hour as
the only available time at
which the entire class can
meet.

The significance of the 10
o’clock class is significant.
With such scheduling sym-
posiums, lectures, films and
other activities designed to
bring the entire college com-
munity together cannot be
programmed.

We feel that students have
legitimate complaints con-
cerning the dedication of
Davidson to its liberal arts
program.

If we are to continue to value
the strength of the Davidson
College liberal arts program,
some investigation and change
is necessary to provide stu-
dents that physical, mental and
spiritual liberation Davidson
promises in.its catalogue.
