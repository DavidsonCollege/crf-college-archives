Studentsinvent reliefs for frustration

By ANN WICKER
Staff Writer

Combatting frustration may
well be the most frustrating
work one can do. Time con-
suming, mentally agrevating,
and physically exhausting, the
war against frustration how-
ever, because it is important,
continues to occupy much of
the Davidson student's ef-
forts.

Each individual at David-

son had his own particular set
of frustrations and usually a
set of partially satisfying re-
liefs. A senior English major,
for example, writes to vent his
spleen. Another senior said, ‘‘I
got so depressed last Sunday
that I ate five packs of M &
M’s.”
_ Davidson has various facil-
ities for help in relieving
frustrations. The athletic fa-
cilities are the places for physi-
cally taking out frustrations
by such activities as playing
basketball, running around
the track, or any other physi-
cal exertion. “Running really
helps me clean my head,” said
one student.

At times the overcrowded
gym can be a source of
frustration all its own, so some
students prefer to relax at the
Union. Union director C Shaw
Smith ovserved, ‘‘We can offer
a yaluable partial answer, if

we (students and union staff

can make it work.”

‘‘Its not Hatties, but the
900 Room is nice,’’ said one
student. Another person ob-
served, ‘‘The Union would be
better if it was 200 miles away
from campus.”

“I think,’”’ said one senior,
“its a neat place and could be
great if more people partici-
pated. It would be nice, for
example, to go over at ten
o’clock every morning and

in each of the dorms, out after
the planned-for kitchen in
Little is completed, the pro-
gram could screech to a halt.

“We would have to displace
students to install more cook-
ing areas, and without addi-
tional housing, removing
dorm rooms is impossible,’’

said Currie.
The handbook states that

‘‘,.Richardson and Little are
air-conditioned, and further
air-conditioning is planned.’’

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. clarified the dis-
crepancy.

‘‘We have no plans to
air-condition’ any more

dorms,”’ said Spencer.
As Director of the Physical

Plant, Meetze is also in charge
of planning future construc-
tion on campus.

“I don’t try to make policy
in my position. Of course I
have my opinions and _ ideas,
but I learned long ago not to
become involved in policy
‘disputes.

‘*I’m not sure whether we
lead in planning for the future
or simply react to student
demands.

“Ideally, we look for ideas

read your mail and see peo-
ple..’

Housed in the basement of
the Union building is another
place to take your frustra-
tions. The counseling center
with a staff of psychologists is
readily available to all stu-
dents. Dr. Meredith Hall ex-
pressed doubts about having
such a ‘‘center.’’ ‘‘Its a nice
facility, but its too formal in
many respects,’’ he said. ‘‘I
would prefer a more relaxed
situation.”

A student also responded
along these lines when ques-
tioned about the value of the
counseling center. ‘‘The idea is
basically good, but by the
time anyone gets it into their
head to go it’s too late. It’s a
last resort because society has
leu us to believe getting this
type of help is a sign of
weakness and its hard to
overcome that stigma,’’ she
said.

Many students feel that one
of the most viable ways of
dealing with the frustrations
of Davidson life is to leave for
a while. ‘‘Going abroad or
otherwise leaving Davidson
for a term or a year can really
help you out of your rut,” said
one senior. Another student
added, ‘‘You get so styled
here. During a term away you
can break out and be your own
person. Going abroad was the
best thing I’ve done in my
whole career at Davidson.”

Meanwhile, there are many
unique ways of relieving frus-
trations that ingenious David-
son students have come up
with. The more common pas-
times people mentioned were
Funning, eating, sleeping, eat-
ing ice, and goofing off by
talking to people.

One student said, ‘‘I turn on
Mott the Hoople or the Stones

from_everyone at the College
and then anticipate what the
needs will be.

Meetze is certain of his
future responsibilities to up-
keep dorms: ‘‘My task is to
maintain the dorms and their
mechanical systems as they
are. They may not be perfect
now, but we will not allow
anything to go downhill,’’ he
concluded.

very loud and yell a lot. It
helps but it doesn’t relieve all
the tension.’’ One junior’s
approach was different. ‘I go
in my room, clean up, and
listen to Jackson Browne. and
cry,’’ she said.

A Senior added, ‘‘I like to
throw things, especially
rocks.” A former resident of
Cannon basement mentioned
that the shower room on that
hall can be turned into a steam
bath. “We used to get four or
five people and a bottle of

Johnny Walker and go in there
and sweat and talk our prob-
lems out. It was great!’’ he
observed.

One sophomore expressed
his favorite relaxation as piano
playing. ‘‘I like to find the
most, secluded piano possible.
Just playing takes my mind
off everything,’” he said.

Another student observed
that, ‘‘Any kind of weird,
bizzare behavior relieves the

tension.”
Problems of frustration are

obviously mot unique to Da-
vidson College. The. Davidson
experience seems to be good
for some and difficult for
others.

“Its a question of trying to
balance the tensions,’’ ex-
plained a student. ‘‘You
should enjoy your studies,
bvut not become obsessed

with them. You just have to

‘learn what you want and how

to get what you want from
life.”

Statement of Student Rights
questioned at open end.

By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor

Wednesday night’s Open
End on the Statement of
Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities, Article XII of the
College Constitution, raised
several questions concerning
the document.

Ten students were present
at the discussion on the eve of
the student referendum on
Draft 13 of Article XII. This
document defines “‘some of the
formal relationships between
students and other groups
within the college,’’ according
to its preamble.

SGA President Bo Baskin
introduced the subject by
giving a brief history of the
College Constitution and Art-
icle XII issues.

“We took twelve drafts to
the faculty and they were shot
down, primarily because they
said the documents defined an
adversary relationship be-
tween the students and the
faculty,’’ Baskin stated.

He continued, ‘Last spring
the faculty said it would pass
it in principle if the ‘conten-
tious language’ was re-
moved.”’

Over the summer the draft
was rewritten, and in Sep-
tember the Trustee Gover-
nance ‘Subcommittee on Art-
icle XII met and accepted the
new draft.

The discussion at the Open
End was primarily centered
around two topics, the extent
to which the Article as it
stands was watered down, and
the relative values of the

election results ana taculty
interpretation of them.

»The sparse audience was
somewhat unresponsive and
much of the discussion was
conducted by Baskin, Mar-
shall, and Davidsonian editor
Matthew Covington.

Covington expressed a be-
lief that the document was
‘‘watered down and hard to
translate into reality.”

‘“‘My concern is for the
mechanics of implementing
the statement and the respon-
sibility for implementation.”’

He stated that implementa-
tion is not provided for in the
document itself but in the
College Registry, which is un-
completed.

Covington added that he
felt terms such as ‘‘due pro-
cess’’ and ‘‘appropriate chan-
nels” fail to supply sufficient
protection under all circum-
stances.

Baskin pointed out that it
should be kept in mind that

Article XII is a ‘Statement of
Student Rights and Responsi-
bilities’, not a ‘Student State-
ment of Rights and Respon-
sibilities’. Students work with

‘faculty and staff representa-

tives in all phases of the
governance operation.

Concerning the question of
the fate of the document
following the election, Baskin
said that, ‘‘If it is voted down
and it went to the faculty
again I doubt we could get
anything better.

Another possibility was rai-
sed by Covington, who said
that the faculty could be
shown that students objected
to the weakening of the article
and registered this displeasure
by rejecting the document.

He proposed fostering stu-
dent interest in this issue and
if the statement were rejected
more interest be | shown by the
student body in the drawing
up of a new and possibly
firmer article.
