ON THE Y. M. C. A.—

For three years we have observed an ele-
ment in Davidson boys which is not at all to
be admired. To be specific, we are speaking
of the attitude of cynicism, of criticizing ev-
erything and everybody. The idea that there
should be no criticism is absurd, but it should
be constructive.

Best example of how this attitude has en-
rooted itself in us is the cynical outlook that
we have adopted toward the local Y. M. C. A.
and its every effort to benefit us spiritually.
We have pinned the term “mish” on boys who
take an active par tin the “Y” and its work.
In many ways we have shown contempt for

the organization. Shaw Smith and his worthy |

assistants have met the student body more
than half way in an attempt to remedy this
situation. While aN Gl
actives and non-actives haye improved, Shaw's
efforts have not met with the success they de-
serve :

relations between he

Another field in which this shows forth is

in that of athletics. We criticize Davidson's
team’s complain because no scholarships are
offered, but when the coaches solicit names of
prospective

have we to criticize a team when
we are too lazy to*go out ourselves ?

“He's a sorry guy.” How many times have
you heard someone say that about a boy that
you don’t even know and have immediately
“listed” him, as the saying goes, without_mak-
ing any attempt to get to know the boy and
form an opinion of your own? This is per-
haps another form of criticism, passing judg-
ment on a person without giving him a fair
chance, but itis nevertheless a fault we would
do well to eliminate here at Davidson.

Of course there have been many other meas-
ures tried for the purpose of aiding in student
development. We have been required to at-
tend chapel services and required to attend
church and required to take Bible courses.
And it cannot be denied that from these things
we have received much inspiration and much
spiritual enlightenment.

But our point is this. Intellectual develop-

ment is not handled by haranguing the stu-
dent body en masse. No, each student is treat-
ed as an individual, and:our college spends
Jarge amounts of money to provide each man
with the courses he particularly needs for his
own development and to keep an accurate rec-
-ord of his progress in such courses. In the
realm of physical development a similar ‘an-
alogy can be drawn. It is the express purpose
of our athletic department to provide every
man the opportunity for personal physical de-
velopment in some sport.

But when it comes to things spiritual, we
fail to find a definite, integrated program de-
signed to fit each man’s spiritual needs. And
we repeat that if ever such an individualized,

GIVING FULL CREDIT—

Perhaps sometimes we are guilty of not be-
ing appreciative of all the efforts that are ex-
pended by certain groups at Davidson in the
interest of the student body. Sometimes we
seem to look over ‘the work done by baék-
stage actors who have necessary roles jn cam-
pus organizations. We refer to men who are
assistants to the sports managers, the sports
managers themselves even, the business staffs
of our publications and others, whose jobs may
not seem difficult; but require their time and

American children discovered bright-col-
ored Easter Eggs last week-end as though
they had found the “hot rocks” of a diamond
thief; however, over in Europe the lads and
lassies of the allied nations found no such “hot
rocks,” but only the burning particles of shrap-

nel scattered everywhere.

It was a Happy Easter for Americans with |

all our material blessings. The weather was
fing, and we-all had the opportunity to dress
in new spring_clothes. We paraded around as
though we saw a bright future ahead. We at-
tended church and heard again the truth con-
cerning the Resurrection and renewed our
hope in Christ. The majority of Americans
had a happy day in their individual places, but
did our thoughts extend further to consider
Faster over all the world?

Maybe we did think of the hated Hitler and
the danger that the Nazis impose upon the
whole world. Maybe we thought again of the
steps that America has taken toward further
endangering herself. But did we think of the
great spirit that Willkie said he found in Eng-
land.

Easter was altogether an intangible com-
memoration and not a tangible celebration in
the Christian countries of Europe. No chic-
kens, no ducks, no rabbits, no eggs, no candy;
but a hope based on their faith in the Risen
Lord. The terrorizing Hitler does not scare
them-when they have this hope. The allies
sacrificed material values, but have
achieved an exalted spirit which cannot be
beaten. Easter was not a time for them fo
show what they had, but to give what they
had. From them we can draw a good lesson.

is the time to face what may come. We must
not be desirous of self-satisfaction, but do
everything possible to develop national ex-
pediency. Strikes and revolts cannot be tol-
erated. “Old Glory” must continue to wave
over the “land of the free and the home of the
brave.” : :

many personal complications and
hard feelings. ;

But somewhere along the line
the system is breaking down. Be-

Smith did not vote for Jones, it is

This picture rated four stars be-
cause of the fact that it is unusual.
It is a comprehensive review of the
inspiring and stirring history of our
country, from the days of the col-
onists to the present. The story is

told in scenes from feature  pic-
tures, shorts and news reels, and in
it you will see the Revolution, the
War of 1812, the Gold Rush of ’49,
the Civil War and many other
events leading up to the present.
The film has ups and downs in in-
terest, sometimes vitally gripping
and occasionally a little slow. Many
scenes afford chances to recognize
your favorite actors or actresses as
they appeared years ago. The en-
tire profits from the picture will go
to the war relief charities, and it af-
fords an excellent opportunity to
enjoy an evening and contribute to
war relief at the same time.

We leave the two! sophisticates
at this time, for already we may
gather several good points from
their little conversation. First, ob-
serve that the junior year gen-
erally marks the departure from
such sophomoric courses as “Gold-
bricking 21: The Study of How
To Proceed From A To B Without
Cutting C.” In short, such witch
willies as “Advanced Mitosis and
Chromosomial Behavior 91” should
be avoided, because this course re-
quires frequent trips to the Campus
Observatory, located on Nurse's
Nob. You should substitute for this
a good’ second-period course such
as “Simple Putting Pfoblems and
How To Dissolve Them 2” or
“Cribbage South of PaNgo-PaNgo
3,” for apple-knuckling will be
stressed next year. The ‘Putting
Problems course will be extremely
interesting, since a number of stim-
ulating field trips will be taken by
the class as a whole} The itinerary
of these trips includes such stops

can see, this offers a wide range
of operation forthe entire apple-
knuckling department.

Group Honors may be taken in
one of eighteen fields, the best of

these being Field I, the Barley
Field, or “How To Mow Your
Own.” This group allows for a

lot of cutting, and is valuable for
that reason only. However, top

cided’ not‘ to pursue this interesting
set of-courses, next year, so you
will have to buy some textbooks,
after all.

One of the most»amusing courses
to be instigated next September.
will be “Faculty Calisthentics 1234,” »
which is of little other interest to
our discussion, except that said
course will do away with alt 8:25
appointments on Mondays. A re-
cent commique from the curriculi-
curricula committee of the college
stated that all) members of the

the new National Defense measures
