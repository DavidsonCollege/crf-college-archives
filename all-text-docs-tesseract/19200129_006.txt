Phi Society.

“The gentleman will please pro-
ceed with his speech” was used but
once by President Calhoun in’ the
hottest debate that has taken place
in the Phi hall for some time. No
one present could doubt but that the

Phi spirit of days gone by had re-)

turned—and to stay,

The debate was on the very time-
ly subject, Resolved, That the
League of Nations be an issue in the
next presidential campaign.

The affirmative, represented by R.
P. Brown, b.. . Burney, and EH. C.
Hamilton argued that this question
should be brought before the people
as this was a republic and politicians
should not rule. By this plan the
people would all have their say and
the plan would be sure to receive an
honorable ratification or rejection
in which politics played no part.
This was also pointed out as being
the only practical way to settle the
question, all other methods, even
Dcompromise, having failed. This
plan was said to be the present prac-
tice in England, The delay of 14
months that this plan would cause
would be a benefit rather than a dis-
advantage as ample time would be
given the people to thoroly think the
matter out for themselves.

The negative, consisting of F. V.
Long, J. C. Deaver and W. K. Me-
Cain, argued in opposition to this
plan ,that the delay was too great
and that party politics would play a
strong hand, thus making it unfair
to the people. It was brought out
that this was not and therefore
should not be made a party issue.

The decision of the judges was for
the affirmative.

Poetical Poteat, who was to give
an oration, seemed to have suffered
from a lapse of memory. He was on
the point of retiring from the hall
when the president reminded him of
the fact that he was to speak. Re-
turning, he gave a short talk on the

Destruction of the Western North
Carolina Forests.” “Many millions
of feets of lumber” have been de-
stroyed by forest fires, according to
Poteat. He recommended protection
to our forests and suggested several
practical methods.

The extemporaneous debate on
“Resolved, That students be allow-
ed to go to the library without wear-
ing coats” was very amusing. The
hall at times was little short of a
pandemonium. Coyte Hunter, for the
affirmative, argued that this was an
age of economy, and clothes are
worn for comfort and not show, mil-

Nichols replied that we were not
a working class of men and that
there was no reason why we should-
n't dréss like gentlemen. It hurts
none of us to wear our cuats to the
library. If this privilege was given
then some of the students who are
inclined to be bolshevik in their ac-
tions would want to go without their
shirts.

The affirmative won the judges’
decision, Throughout the entire
program Booker was not to be
heard. The hypothesis has been ad-
vanced that he must have been as-
leep, but reliable authorities state
that. even sleep does not keep him
quiet.

The declamation contest was an-
nounced as coming the second Mon-
day in February, Seniors were ad-
vised to look up their credits and
not be short when commencement
comes.

Eu Society

There was no regular program at
the Eumenean Society Saturday
night on account of the election of
officers for the second term. [. H.
Mauze and Papl Ci Menge were re-
ceived into the society.
dy?"19, made a short talk outlining
the importance of the suciety work

and stating the benefits he had re- .

ceived from its membership.

C. A. McGirt was elected presi-
dent and J. C..McCaskill vice-presi-
dent by a unanimous vote. EE. B.
McGukin was elected secretary and
RK. T. 1. Liston, reviewer: W. OB.
Sullivan, valedictorian.

On accotunt of the large member-
ship the society was divided into two

sections, as nearly equal as possible,

one section to meet on Saturday
night and the other on Monday, The
purpose of this division was two-
fold: first, to allow men to serve on
the program more frequently; sec-
ond, to arouse more interest in the
society by having contests between
the two sections, There will be one
president, but cach section witl have
its own vice-president, reviewer and
seeretary. ltvery six weeks a juint
meeting will be held, at which meet-
ing all business will be transacted
and a debate held between the two
sections.

“Tingua bal Chenesi,” said Menge,
closing a most cloquent and force-
on the affirmative of the
debate in which he, speaking in Chi-

hese, opposed W. P. Cumming, nega-

tive, speaking in Japanese. on the
subject, “Resylved, That China is a
greater country than Japan. The
hous® and judges both decided in
favor of the affirmative. White
criticized the debate in Spanish. Im-
mediately after this pentecostal out-
break, nominations for respondent
were declared in order, and Liston

litical oratory, seemed to equal
those of Demosthenes, nominated a

however, moved that Mr. Liston

charming host and victim at a mur-

der party after meeting; funeral,

services were held from the house
at 4 p.m. Sunday). Boulware, lead-
ing candidate on the Listonian
ticket, was declared elected respond-
ent and the house adjourned.
