JOURNEY TO CHINA

By Brooke BAGWELL

Staff Writer

As students studied far away
places through the classroom,
other Davidson scholars explored
foreign countries first-hand.

Last semester, Professor of
English Gill Holland sponsored a
semester abroad in China through
a program based in Washington
D.C., called China Educational
Tours. Living in Beijing, the capi-
tal, the students studied at a Chi-
nese university and had several
opportunities for adventure.

Ten students from Davidson
and 9 others from Presbyterian
College, Guilford College, the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, and Wake Forest Uni-
versity attended the Capital Nor-
mal University College of For-
eign Languages in the western
part of Beijing.

The students lived in dorms,
took four classes for four hours
each day, including two language
classes, a contemporary Chinese
literature class taught by Dr. Hol-
land, and a seminar on Chinese
environmental issues.

Davidson student Chris Wil-
liams says the “workload was
probably light in comparison to
Davidson” and allowed time for
travel and experimentation with

Chinese culture. Travel consisted
of weekly group trips and indi-
vidual trips. The difficulties of

transportation proved to be an ob-
stacle for the students, but Hol-
land says the Davidson students
“were fearless in accepting the
challenge of Chinese transporta-
tion.” Transportation within the
city was most convenient by taxi
or bike.

Individual exploration took
students all over China from tour-
ist attractions to little known rural
towns: Katie Saldarini described
journeying eight hours by bus to
visit a small Tibetan town in the
Gansu Province, called Xiahe.She
also trekked to Xi’an, where an
army of terra-cotta soldiers are
buried, and to a private beach for
communist Chinese officials. John

Spainhour and Williams also went
to Shanghai and to the Great Wall
of China.

Living, traveling, and study-
ing among the Chinese provided
each group member the opportu-
nity for total immersion in Chinese
language and lifestyle. Students
initially reported difficulty with
the language, but as Williams said,
“the language barriers fell down as
the semester went by.” Saldarini
mentioned that once the students
began to understand the language
better, it was “much easier to use
because there are no verb tenses,
and you can form sentences
quickly.”

Many students of the group

plan to keep up their Chinese and
possibly pursue careers dealing
with China or the Chinese lan}
guage. Both Spainhour and Will}
iams indicated an interest in con4
tinuing study of Chinese aq
Davidson; they are both consider+
ing living in China again afteq
college. Williams still communi-
cates with his Chinese roommate
and plans to go into marketing of
sales dealing with China.
Holland felt the main succes
of the trip was the motivation o:
the students. Holland said, “It wa
a challenge and the students ros
to the occasion. They took advan
tage of every opportunity an
earned the respect of everybody.’

AIDS
speakers

“When you get beyond the
shock and adjustment of finding
out you’re HIV positive,” says Joel
Goldman, “you realize that you
need to make the most of every
day.”

When Goldman discovered he
was HIV positive, he decided to
help others prevent the deadly dis-
ease. With a mixture of humorand
real-life college scenarios,
Goldman and his friend T.J.
Sullivan will present “Friendship
in the age of AIDS” Wednesday at
7:30 in Love Auditorium.

Since the pair began traveling
in 1993, they have presented their
program to more than 150,000 stu-
dents. The two travel full-time
with their program to more than 80
campuses each year.

Sullivan believes that this pro-
gram will stick with students more
than most AIDS awareness pro-
grams: “Students don’t expect to
laugh this hard at an AIDS pro-
gram,” he says, “It doesn’t take
them long to realize that we’ re not
your typical AIDS educators.”

ment is toward the creation of iso-
lated subdivisions, connected only
by major roads.

According to the Davidson
Plan, however, traffic would be
free to move in any direction rather
than emptying out onto several
heavily trafficked thoroughfares.

Although the plan may affect
certain areas of vacant campus on
the outskirts of the College’s main
grounds, Lawing says, “the exist-
ence of the campus affects’ the
town much more than the Land
Plan Will affect Davidson [Col-
lege].”

Bob Collins concurs and ex-
plains that there is a possibility
that roads may be constructed on

some of the college’s vacant prop-
erty between Highway 115 and
Grey Road in order to relieve traf-
fic in the downtown area.
However, he says, “we will

‘ try to minimize impact and find a

nice balance between land.use and
college need.”

In addition to traffic issues,
the Plan addresses modification of
future urban development.

In what Lawing describes as
a “reorientation” toward an older
neighborhood concept, the plan
aims to preserve open space. Rather
than building homes isolated by
large lots, builders are granted per-
mission to develop more homes on
smaller plots of land, creating a
greater sense of community and
neighborhood. Creators of the plan
say they’ve also attempted to en-
courage a level of mixed housing
not often seen in today’s develop-

| ment.

Yet many members of the
Davidson community feel that, as
stated in the draft of Davidson’s
Land Plan, “It would be difficult to
improve upon the traditional
American small town...” For this
reason, the Land Plan seeks not to
change Davidson’s character, but
rather “to adapt the best of this
tradition to the conditions of the
late 20th and early 21st Century.”
