SPECIAL WEEKEND

This is that special weekend.

This is the Davidson dance weekend. The local in-
habitants, popularly known as “Gentlemen,” put on
their best for the invading hordes of pulchritude.

We have sort of a tag team affair working this
weekend, with Buddy Morrow running the Friday night
lap and Ralph Marterie subbing for the Saturday night
fling.

If the date knows no better than to ask about Da-
vidson athletics, the Gentleman will have to confess that
the boys aren't having, their best seasons. But he'll
hasten to point to Semi Mintz, one of the top foul shoot-
ers in the country, Westy Westervelt, who decked the
conference wrestling champ last week, and Tom Hudgins,
who just signed the swimming record book.

Down On The Range

If the Gentleman seems a little hard of hearing, his
guest will hear the story of his day with L-square and the
boys down on the 1000-inch range.

Since no athletic events are slated for the cam-
pus this weekend, the Gentleman and his date will
have to go elsewhere for sport. The Homecoming
belles were fortunate enough, you'll recall, to see
our soccer team in action.

Of course, they can always perch themselves be-
fore the magic screen and watch the ACC haskethall
scrap. You'll have to admit, you can’t hardly find that
brand of ball nowhere else.

The typical dance weekend itinerary will carry
blissful pairs past the football practice field, where the
Gentleman may recreate for his date visions of padded
watriors knocking heads-to gain a spot on the Wildcat
eleven.

This will give him an opportunity to recall his high
school days, impressing the date with his all-county ef-
forts (honorable mention) for the old alma mater.

The victory was highlighted
by some of the best floorwork
and ball handling seen to date.

High men in the point column
for Davidson were Ferguson and

Tuesday night as the ‘Cats,

out of steam and ended up on
the short end of an 85-70 score

Our Gentleman may even bring out his old DAVID-
SONIAN and reveal to her how he won a handball game,
or scored the winning touchdown, or took third in the
100-yard freestyle, for old Iota Lambda. He'll point out,
too, that the Iotes are running third in overall I-F compe-
tition. “And we always pick up a slew of points in ping
pong.”

The athletically-inclined student won’t stop at
the football field, but will also show the lady the
scenic wonders of the tennis courts, the soccer field,
the golf course, and, if he really likes her, the 1000-
inch range.

lipstick stained shirts, and the silent footprints of Cop

not easily forgotten.

VPI Grapplers Take
Cats By 33-3 Margi

Harold Westervelt captured
the only- Wildcat victory as the
Davidson wrestling team fell vic-
tim to the rugged V.P.L. matmen
Monday night, 33-3.

V.P.L, by far the toughest
opponent the Wildcats have met
this year, pinned six of the lo-
eal grapplers.

Carroll Pitts, Bobby McIntyre,
and Wallor Taylor were pinned
in the 123, 120, and 137 pound
classes, respectively. Charlie
Lampley was then pinned by|
Vandievender. In the 157 pound
class, Milton Gee gave Crowgey

V.P.L, with four individual
champions, will be strong fa-
vorites to cop this year’s South-
ern Conference tournament.

On February 20, the ‘Cats
travel to Pfeiffer for the sec-
ond meeting between the two
teams. Davidson won the first
match here earlier in the sea-

The Wildcats will end the cur-
rent season February 26 in a
match with Washington and
Lee, following which the ‘Cats
will spend a week in prepara-
tion for the Southern Confer-
ence Tournament to be held in
Lexington, Virginia, March 7-8.

Westervelt, who currently is
participating in the Georgia
AA.U. meet in Atlanta, will
be favored to keep his Con-
ference title and will carry the
Wildcat hopes in the tourna-
ment.

So the Kappa Sigs have Joyner. So the K.A.s have

Ferguson. So the Sigma Chis have Killian. Don’t believe’
that the basketball tournament is being closed out, how-

ever, bv anv of these teams.

After twenty games, the K.A.s,
Kappa Sigs. and the Sigma Chis
are in a tic for first place with
three wins and no losses apiece.

On Tucsday night the K.A.s
j downed the Independents, 68-22
_with Fred Streetman and Dave
. Page leading the scoring, while
the Kappa Sigs eased out the

Betas by a slim 8 point margin
with Donny McQueen standing
out as the winners’ leading
; Scorer.

Then on Wednesday night the
Sigma Chis, sparked by Don Kil-
lian. rendered a determined
S.P.E. offense powerless as they
fell before the tricky Chi squad
by a score of 73 to 30.

SECOND PLACE

In second place are the ATO’s,
with two wins and no losses to
their credit. The SAE’s hold

the terms of the team members,| third place with three wins and

one loss, with the Pi Kapps
pushing them from fourth place,
having two wins and one loss.
There is a four way tie for
fifth place between the Phi
Gams, Betas, Phi Delts, and Pi-
kas, cach team having one win
and two losses in the records.
The Independents and Sigma
Nus are tied for sixth place with

no wins and three losses apiece
while the S.P.E.s are in seventh
place with no wins and four
losses.

HANDBALL
After four rounds in the
handball tournament the Phi

DeltsS, Sigma Chis, and Betas
are tied for first place with
four wins and no losses apiece.
There is a three-way tie for sec-
ond place also between the
K.A.s, Kappa Sigs, and A.T.O.s,
each team having three wins
and one loss to their credit.

The third place ‘slot is held
by the Phi Gams who have won
two and lost twa, The SA F.e
are in fourth place with one win
and three losses while the Pi
Kapps, Sigma Nus, Pikas, and
S.P.E.s are tied for fifth place
with no wins and four losses
apiece.

Both the basketball and the
handball tournaments promise
a pretty close and exciting race
before they are finished. Coach
Whittle said that this pleased
him very much and that he
thought that all the fraternities
were doing a wonderful job in
making this a very successful
inter-fraternity sports program.
