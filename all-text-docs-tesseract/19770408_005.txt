Dissidents, dissent and the USSR

By ERNEST PATTERSON
Faculty Guest Columnist

Everyone is in favor of ‘‘human
rights.’ Everyone is also against sin,
or at least against anyone enjoying it.

The specific ‘‘human right’’ that is
currently getting the most attention
in the U.S. is the right to dissent,
especially the right to dissent of
Soviet and Eastern European citi-
zens.

There are several facts about
dissent and dissidents that are uni-
versal in time and space. Every
society has ‘‘dissidents,’’ ‘‘heretics,’’
and “‘subversives.”” What constitutes
“dissidence,” ‘‘heresy,’’ or ‘‘subver-
sion’’ differs from society to society
and from time to time in a given
society. Every society suppresses and
punishes its “‘dissidents,”’ directly or
indirectly, openly or subtly.

Any person who dissents should
accept such suppression and punish-
ment as an occupational hazard, and
understand that the more ‘‘danger-
ous’’ the dissent is conceived to be by
the ‘“‘powers that be,” the greater are
the hazards and the more severe the
suppression and punishment.

What specifically constitutes
‘“‘heresy’’ ‘‘subversion,’’ or ‘‘dissi-
dence’ for any given society will be
determined and defined by the ‘“‘es-
tablishment,’’ the dominant class,
group, or faction. That is to say,
though beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, heresy is in the mind of the

To the Editor:

I’ve often felt the urge to write to
this newspaper, but until now I’ve
always managed to put off any
production ef verbiage until after the
deadtine for the next issue. Why have
I finally come through? Because you
have offended me. :

resulted in my taking offense at
something printed in your newspaper.
On the editorial page of your last
issue, for the first time in several
weeks, I found an editorial vhat
_neither condemned my apathy or
competitive spirit, nor incited me to
riot. To my dismay, just below I
found a short editorial that seemed to
call me a hypocrite, or, at least,
purported that I was “poisoned with
hypocrisy’’. I resent that, both for
myself and for the others on the
board, whom I respect.

ruling class, or more accurately, in
the minds of the mandarins—
Veblen’s, Defenders of the Estab-
lished Order and Guardians of the
Vested Interests who formulate
and defend the accepted theories and
philosophies of the society.

The only really ‘‘dangerous’’ heresy
in the U. S., socialism or communism,
is effectively suppressed by the
complete cultural hegemony—a con-
cept developed by the Italian Marx-
ist, Antonio Gramsci—that is exer-
cised by the ideology of capitalism.

“Cultural hegemony’”’ refers to that
process by which a cohesive ruling
class imposes its values on the society
as a whole, (through the efforts of the
above mentioned mandarins, who
man—no pun intended —the media
and the schools,( and is thereby able
to induce voluntary acceptance of its
privileged position by the subordinate
groups.

The most important factor operat-
ing in this area is the ‘chill factor,”
produced by the rapidity and certain-
ty with which college professors,
among others, are fired whenever
they are identified as active socialists.
Any professor who remains a
Katheder-sozialist will experience rel-
ative mild punishment.

Ronnie Dugger, in Our Invaded
Universities, describes the
firing of an University of Texas
professor who had publicly identified
himself as a socialist. Sugger records
how the chairman of the University
Board of Regents used the American
Association of University Professors
Statement on Academic Freedom to
justify firing the professor. He quotes
a colleague of the fired professor as
saying the use of the Statement was ‘
nothing short of brilliant.’ "’
Dugger, more acutely and accurately
observes, ‘‘...It was nothing short of
proof that the AAUP concept of

You are apparently concerned that
the three members you mentioned in
your editorial will exert undue
influence upon the board in favor of
WDAV. Now that I-have told you
some interests of other board
members, maybe we can have our
names mentioned in an editorial as
well. After all, I might pressure you
into giving my employer reduced
rates, get poems by young
Communist. poets in the Miscellany,
or ask WDAV to play more Dylan and
to have Sid Barrett sing Happy
Birthday to my daughter.

It would seem to most serious
students of the USSR that Soviet
ideology is sufficiently established to
exercise cultural hegemony and that
there is little need, beyond the same
level of internal spying exercised in
the 'U. S. by the FBI and local police
departments, for any vast or wide
suppression of dissent in the Soviet
Union.

‘‘Dissidents’’ can be, and are,
sustained by the knowledge of the
important and necessary role that
‘“‘dissent’’ plays in every society.
(Alan Barth wrote that “criticism and
dissent are the indispensable antidote
to major delusions (in a society)).
Also by the knowledge that in the
long run, though it is listed under
“error,’’ opposite “truth,” by Roget,
“heresy” has frequently become or-
thodoxy.

The importance of ‘‘dissent’’ and
‘“‘heresy’’ for the continued good
social health of a society is indicated
by an observation of the late Judge
Learned Hand. He noted: ‘Heretics
have been hateful from the beginning
of recorded time; they have been
ostracized, exiled, tortured, mained,
and butchered; but is has generally
proved impossible to smother them;
and when it has not, the society that
has succeeded has always declined.”’

Since it is highly unlikely that the
USSR will follow President Carter’s
advice and cease suppressing its
heretics, it follows from the above
that the USSR will decline. (If such
advice should be followed, and the
USSR remains a strong and viable
society, Mr. Carter would surely lose
his seat on the Trilateral Commis-
sion.)

Before the U. S. takes too much
comfort from the ‘‘inevitable’’ decline
of the USSR, it should be recalled

that, as noted above, dissent and
heresy, i.e., socialism, has been
effectively eliminated in this country,

‘and the same logic supplies here.

But, as Keynes remarked, ‘In the
long run we are all dead,”’ and this
applies to heretics, who may be, and
have been, dead in a shorter run that
the average person. Therefore any
self-respecting ‘‘dissident’’ would like
to have all the legitimate and effective
support possible.

The question then becomes, what is
the most legitimate and effective
support? As a general rule, support

- from private individuals is much more

effective, and certainly infinitely more
legitimate, than support from govern-
ments. :

It is generally conceded that the
least effective support is from govern-
ment officials of another society,
especially from one whose past behav-
ior gives some cause for believing that
said society does not wish complete
success and eternal life for the
“dissident’s’”’ society, and such sup-
port is not likely to result in full
cession of persecution.

Dr. David Owen, the new British
Foreign Secretary, in a recent speech
made an important and practical
distinction between what individuals
and governments can usefully and
properly do in championing human
rights. As reported in the

‘Manchester Guardian Weekly, he no-

ted that ‘‘it is quite proper and
usually splendid for people ‘to stand
up and be counted,’ but governments
are required to calculate the varied
consequences of their words and
deeds and the problems of human
rights in the conduct of interna-
tional affairs is one of immense
complexity and subtlety.....A Gov-
ernment’s first task is to provide and
sustain the framework of peace and
security within wiuch human rights
can be discussed, championed, and
enlarged.’ ”’

Dr. Owen also stressed a point

-which has never been understood and

accepted by the U. S. public, nor by
any leader since FDR, i.e., ‘that the
objectives of ‘detente’ haVe never |
included preventing’ the emergence
and continuadnceof the. USSR as a
global power or to ‘Cotivagt the
Russians and their allies from Com-
munism.’

President Carter is certainly to be
commended for hig statements in
favor of “human rights,” though one

hopes that he does not get carried

away and resolve to speak out against
deprivation of ‘human rights”:
time and wherever

To do so would require ec e
tention 24 hours a day, ya
year, and 366 days in ext
Presidential election year, ittle

time would be left for pT and

and security (economic, not military)
within which human rights can be...

The support for “dissidents” that
comes from individuals which is both
effective and legitimate is that from
fellow ‘‘dissidents,’’—that is,
Servetus, not Calvin; Eugene Debs,
not Woodrow Wilson, (who refused
even to pardon Debs) — and preferably
from “‘dissidents” of one’s own coun-

It follows, then, that the best
advice one can give to “dissidents”’
and “heretics’’ everywhere is, “Look
All-Gift Horses in the Mouth.”
