completing engagements at the
Glen Island Casino, the Strand
Theater in New York, and the
Ritz Club in Bridgeport, Conn. His |
orchestra has been. playing ~ for
some months, over the National
Broadcasting Company’s wave
lengths.

Spivak: recently played at a
dance set of the University of

Georgia, in Athens, where he was
a treméndous success, according to
MacLean. MacLean added. that he
played to capacity crowds there.
Spivak’s trumpet playing is said
to be among the best in the field, |
and the style of his band is accord-
ingly built ‘around it. It is report-

ed that the orchestra specializes in

tclear-cut, subdued, sweet ing,
| but plays little of the so-called “hot”
