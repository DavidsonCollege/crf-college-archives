THE DAVIDSONIAN

purchases the Pulper

By Jessica GooDSON

Of late, Vail Commons has
been on the tongues of many
Davidson students. In particular,
the newly-purchased “Pulper” has
generated intense discussion.

Many students have questioned
the value of installing the machine.

Commons representatives
Barbara Metzler and Dee Phillips
maintain that their latest investment
is cost-efficient and environmen-
tally sound.

Metzler, manager of the Com-
mons, attributes the need for the
pulper to poor drainage and flood-
ing in the past, amenace todishroom
staffers.

“We literally walked on wa-
ter,” she said. The Pulper alleviates
the problem by removing excess
water through asieve, allowing it to
flow through narrow drainage pipes
unhindered by bulk trash. Water is
also recycled through the pulper to
conduct food and paper waste into
its grinder.

In order for the pulper to func-
tion properly, it must pulverize a

high volume of fibrous material.
For this reason, the Commons cur-
rently purchases pressed styrofoam
cups in lieu of reuseable glasses.
The cups lend the bulk necessary to
maintain efficiency.

Pressed Styrofoam, as opposed
to bubble styrofoam, is nontoxic. It
is not made with CFCs and is not a
threat to the Ozone layer.

Taking the place of a garbage
disposal and eliminating the need
for three dumpsters, the pulper is
also self-cleaning, which reduces
the manpower required to keep the
dishroom in ship shape.

The new 10-0z. cups hold just
as much beverage as glasses (al-
though students tend to think the
Styrofoam cups are smaller), and
the cost of regular shipments is off-
set by the reduction in staff, wasted
water, and trash pick-up.

While the Commons once
dumped 72 cubic yards of trash in a
week, they now take only 16 cubic
yards to the dump per week, a re-
duction of approximately 78 per-
cent. This is a reduction in trash
density, not in the amount of raw
trash.

What you may not realize
about your dining service

e — Printing the Davidson logo on the cups, napkins, and sugar packets is
actually less expensive than purchasing ordinary paper products. Stamp-
ing the logo is essentially a pledge from the Commons (which has the
purchasing power) that they will buy every.cup, napkin, or-sugar packet in
the shipment. Because the manufacturer is guaranteed to profit from each
bulk shipment, it offers a reduced price.

¢ The Commons can accommodate students with allergies or dietary
restrictions by preparing special meals or alerting students to problematic
ingredients. Ginger Taylor, a registered dietician, is available to give free

counseling to students.

¢ Dee Phillips, purchasing and production manager, is always looking
for new recipes. If you have suggestions, contact her at ext. 2600. In
addition, Phillips is more than willing to take any curious students on a tour
of the kitchen and dish room, which includes a stop at the Pulper station.

¢ From 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m. Sept. 17, vendors sponsored by the U.S.
Food Service will offer a range of entrees, fresh fruit, and desserts to be
evaluated by students for possible addition to the Commons menu.

The Commons

Service organizations across

campus to form council

By Mike Brapy
Staff Writer

he statement of purpose indi

cates that one of the primary
goals of Davidson is “to assist stu-
dents in developing humane in-
stincts and disciplined and creative
minds for lives of leadership and
service.”

Service has always been an in-
tegral part of the Davidson experi-

ence and, with the inauguration of

President Kuykendall in 1984, a
formal challenge was made to the
college community to meet the
needs of service and leadership on
campus and in the greater society.
As a result, the past 13 years have
seen countless service projects and
the growth of numerous service or-
ganizations.

Somany different activities and
groups arose that in 1988 the Task
Force for Service decided that a
“service council” or umbrella orga-
nization was necessary to.unify the
Davidson service effort. This idea
became the organization known as
Reach Out.

Since the creation of Reach Out,
service on campus has grown and
blossomed to the multitude of op-
portunities for service that are avail-
able today. With service going on
in 21 different Reach Out projects,
Patterson Court, the faculty,
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
Dean Rusk, alternative breaks,
Project Life, Into The Streets, and
many others, service opportunites
are now available throughout the

°

campus and region. However, these
options can at times be problem-
atic. There are so many choices that
some projects are overlooked or
students could feel overwhelmed.
So when a second Task Force
for Service met in 1997, there was a
definite consensus that a more di-
verse campus wide umbrella orga-
nization would be helpful in con-
centrating student service efforts

by providing one central location

students could go to for information
on volunteering.

Their efforts evolved into the
Service Council. Davidson’s ser-
vice department, headed by Ruth
Pittard, Laura McCarthy, and Bill
Abrams, placed the responsibility
of getting it started into the hands of
senior Ben Kinnaman and sopho-
more Ann Culp.

There are currently 400 stu-
dents doing service on a weekly
basis and 85 percent of the entering
freshmen were active in commu-
nity service.

“Service has become an inte-
gral part of the Davidson experi-
ence,” Culp said. “The Service
Council’s jobis to bring representa-
tives from each service organiza-
tion together to create one vision for
service at Davidson. Each group is
doing avery good job already, but if
we work toward one goal, we can
do even better.”

Kinnaman and Culp have been
involved in many service projects
through Davidson and have put in
many hours working with staff and
students to put together a council

and define its purpose, mission, and
benefits.

Currently, the council is com-
posed of two co-chairs, a secretary,
and 16 representatives from exist-
ing service organizations and acom-
munity representative.

The council’s main purpose is
to pull together all the service groups
on campus and be able to provide a
central location for service infor-
mation regarding many different
aspects of student life.

Though it will do no service
within itself, the student run coun-
cil will be able to provide the struc-
ture for larger projects by having
access to the whole student body
and the many service organizations.

Having this structure will
greatly reduce the planning time of
large-scale projects.

“If a structure like this had ex-
isted for the Wildcat Habitat House
we could have cut the organiza-
tional time by about a semester,”
Kinnaman said.

The council hopes to become a
source of monetary support and fa-
cilitate the handling of budgets for
campus service.

Even more so, the long term
goal of the council is to provide a
means to see how Davidson service
can greater affect lives and the com-
munity around us.

As the purpose of the College
states, service, leadership, and hu-
mane instincts, are central to: the
Davidson education and experience.

The council has its first plan-
ning meeting Wednesday.

Moving away

By Laura CRAVER
Staff Writer

Students opened their Sept. 13,
1957 Davidsonian to these welcom-
ing words from President Pietonpol:

“Davidson College seeks to train,

young men whoare Christian gentle-
men.”
No one was surprised; in fact,

this very credo had lured them to

, the Presbyterian school. A record

number of students — 246 to be
exact — moved to Davidson in
hopes of leaving as refined, South-
ern, Christian gentlemen.

But 40 years later, freshmen
are not so intent on the same goals
outlined by Dr. Pietonpol. Approxi-
mately 230 women registered this

from College’s proudly homogeneous past

semester, not in hopes of graduat-
ing as gentlemen, but rather in hopes
of receiving the finest education a

second mortgage can buy.

Today, one will not find a
Davidson yearbook boasting the
Davidson mission of 1957, but in-
stead will gaze upon the faces of
over 1600 men and women of all
sorts of backgrounds, nationalities,

and religions.

Of the 250 men whocomprised
the Class of 1961, 187 called either
North Carolina, South Carolina, or
Virginia home, and all but four grew

up below the Mason-Dixon Line.

No longer is such geographical
concentration the case. The Class
of 2001 claims students from all
over the United States, as well as

the world. As a result, students

. from countries such as Turkey and
‘Japan add a much-appreciated in-

ternational flavor to the campus
community.

Just as today’s Davidson takes
pride in its heterogenous composi-
tion, the institution in 1957 took
pride in being homogenous.
“Davidson has been accused in the
past of producing the ‘homogeneous
man,’”’ wrote one student in an edi-
torial.

People with the same back-
grounds of ideology, religion, so-
cial status, economic standing, and
heritage, we plead’ guilty with a
sense of appreciation.”

Simple observation will prove
Davidson has matured into more

than a “finishing school” for the
wealthy, middle-to-upperclass,
Christian young man. In 40 years,
Davidson has evolved into a more
cosmopolitan campus while still
managing a firm grip on precious
Davidson traditions.

One of those traditions is
Patterson Court, which began con-
struction in the fall of 1957. Atthe
ground-breaking, the Davidsonian
reported 12 houses were to be built
— complete with quarters for the
house mother — at an estimated
cost of $30,000.

So while 40 years may have
brought monumental changes in
Davidson’s student composition,
1957 may best be remembered for |.
