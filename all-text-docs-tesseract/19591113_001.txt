Students Pick Hospital —

For Christmas Gift Fund

Student voting this morning selected the Bangkok Christian Hospital for the |

— Christmas Gift Fund Project. The YMCA will begin receiving student and)

faculty
Joe Eifort, chairman of the
1959 Gift Fund, urged student
support of the drive: “Solicita-
tion will begin on the 16th or
17th (of November). All solicit-
ing will be done by students;
both students and faculty will
be approached. We hope to re-
ceive all contributions by Wed-
nesday the 25th, before Thanks-
giving.”

As in past years, the stu-
dent body selected the re-
cipient of the annual Christ-
mas Gift. Two proposals were
presented to the student body
in chapel programs. These
were: aid to Hong Kong stu-
dents and a contribution to
a Thailand hospital.

Mr. Leon Marion of the
World University Service spoke
Thursday about the need for
support of student refugees in
Hong Kong. There are at least
1,000 student refugees in the
city, who are but a part of the
one million political refugees
in Hong Kong.

The students need assistance
in order to continue their
schooling. Their needs include
food, clothing, housing, medical
facilities, and books. These are
but a few of the many needs of
these refugee students.

donations the first of next. week.

Col. Adams presented the
second project Friday. He
spoke on the need for support
of the Bangkok Christian
Hospital. Opened in Thailand
after the close of World War
ll, it is presentiy headed by
Dr. Marshall P. Wells, a
Presbyterian Medical Mission-
ary.

Even with limited facilities
the hopsital treated 58,400 pa-
tients in the first seven years
of operation. With tensions
along the border of China, the
flow of Christians into free
Thailand is very heavy. Thus
the treatment of refugees is a
great problem.

Commenting on. his associa-
tion with the hospital, Lt. Col.
Adams related) many stories
from his period of active duty

in Thailand. Among them is a
narrative about a servant boy
named Thep, who worked for
him. Through the ceaseless ef-
forts of the hospital staff, Thep
had a maimed foot restored to
usefulness. He was both cured
physically and restored social-
ly, for such an infirmity casts
a shadow of prejudice against
any native living under a re-
ligious system of reincarnation.

“The problems in Thai-
land are great both for Chris-
tianity and for the medical

profession. The missionaries
work hard hours with limited
facilities.”

At present two Davidson
families have been in the Thai
land mission fields: Dr. and
and Mrs.
and Dr. and Mrs.
ris. The Harris family has had |
some member in the Thailand)
mission for over 100 years.

this proposal

“My abiding
hospital makes

much more than a passing in-|

terest for me,” stated Col
Adams.
Mr: Leon Marion, who

spoke for the first project,
is from the Regional office of
the World University Service.
The organization is interna-
tional with headquarters in
Geneva, Switzerland. It ad-
ministers to student needs
throughout much of the
world. In this country it is
supported by various Church

related movements: YMCA,
Universal Christian Youth
Movement, etc. 8 ea

Eifort commented on the

goal set for this year's fund.
“Last year we raised only

$2200, as compared with $3900
in 1957. We hope to far surpass
last year’s total by setting a

goal of $4500.”

Dr. Martin Seren
Birthday Plot Instigated

At the crack of dawn last Wednesday morning over 100 representatives of the

Davidson R.O.T.C. cadet corps and about 30 shivering students gathered under

Dr. Grier Martin’s bedroom window and honored the president with the strangest
birthday party since the days of Marshall Ney.

The highlight of the early
morning proceedings was the
dedication of the Davidson Col-
lege Honor Guard as The Mar-
tin Honor Guard. The name
“Martin” over the past 90
years has been prominent in
the history of Davidson College
and its ROTC program.

At 6:30 am., a bleary-eyed

band and Honor Guard formed
at the ROTC department and

snuck up to the president's
house. At a little before seven,
the band burst forth with a
salvo of “Happy Birthday” and
a bleary-eyed Dr. Martin ven-
tured out onto his front porch
to see what was going on.
Col. Adams, representing
the ROTC department, and
Dee Green, representing the
student body, greeted Dr.
Martin and explained just

what all the music was about.
Cadet Brigade Commander
Bob Croom then read the of-
ficial proclamation which re-
designated the Davidson Col-
lege Honor Guard as The
Martin Honor Guard.

T he prominent § Martins’
recognized in the proclamation
were Col. William J. Martin,
who. served the college from
1869 to 1888 as Professor of
Chemistry, vice-president and
acting president; his son, Dr.
William Joseph Martin, who be-
came president of the college
in 1912 and was president dur-
ing the foundation of the Da-
vidson College ROTC program
in 1919. Also recognized, his
son, W. J. Martin, Jr., M.D., who
has actively supported the col:
lege; his. grandson, Second Licu-
William J. Martin, II,
who was a Distinguished Mili-
tary Graduate of the Davidson
Cadet Corps, Class of
1957, who died on active duty;
and finally, Dr. D. Grier Mar-
tin, thirteenth president of the

y college and an active supporter
s of the Cadet Corps.

Following the reading of
the proclamation, Croom pre-
sented the Honor Guard, un-
der the command of Cadet
Capt. John Wilsey, to Dr.
Martin for inspection.

Wilsey then presented a gi-

gantic birthday cake topped off!

with the emblem of the Honor
Guard to the President, who
is 49.

Dr. Martin, clad in a_ bath-
robe and pajamas and clutching
a morning newspaper, seemed
surprised by the
whole thing. “I'm sorry you
all had to get up so early, but
I really appreciate it,” he
smiled.

The dedicatory ceremonies
were covered by Charlotte
newspapers and television re-
porters.

Mr. Robert Porterfield, asso-
teiated with the Barter Theater
in Abingdon, Virginia, visited
the campus Thursday and Fri
jday. Noted as a consultant on
| drama and drama facilities, he
{discussed plans for the 300-seat
janceoetne, which will be a
/major construction factor in
| the new building

“All too often. lack of fore
| sight permanently ruins a thea
jter or auditorium. There are
imany technical problems in
volved, and budget skimping
creates even more,” Porterfield
said during a discussion with
several faculty members and
two representatives of Red and

|

Black Masquers.
PLAN PRECAUTIONS
He recommended _ certain

general precautions in planning
a stage. “A stage should always
be as flexible as possible. There
must be facilities for many and
varied lighting effects, and
good arrangements for each of
the many events for which the
auditorium will be used.”

In meetings held with Mr. J.
B, Lashmitt, college architect,
Mr. Porterfield and the admini-
stration were able to present
recommendations for plan

changes in the interior, No
major construction changes are
foreseen at this time

The college will attempt to
fit the suggested changes into
the exterior plans already en
visioned. However, should
drastic changes become nece
_sary in the future, the outside
will be changed accordingly

TOM RIDENHOUR

“A system of unlimited cuts
for Davidson? Why. you must
be joking. That would make the
students more mature in their
class attendance and place re-

professors would .not have a

many “dead heads” could and
would be weeded out.”

DAVE ROBINSON

“A more liberal cut policy,
would, I feel, be a positive con-
tribution to the Davidson pro-
gram if accompanied by other
reforms. Higher quality — lec-
tures and more intensive and
independent student work
could well result from an. un-
limited cut program approached
in several steps from our pres-
ent system.

“However, I feel that the DA-
VIDSONIAN's campaign is too
narrow in scope; a more liberal
isystem with regard to class at-
}tendance should be accompa-
nied by a curriculum more fe-

sponsive to student needs.
Thus, I think that the DAVID-
SONIAN should campaign
equally intensively for such
things as more seminar oppor-
jtunities, additions to one man

departments, interdepartmental

work, a Christian ethics course
to replace one of the present
offerin of the Bible Depart-
ment, increased attention to
the problems of modern cul-
ture, and comprehensive exam-
inations at the end of fhe sen-
ior year.” :

DEE GREEN

“I am certainly in favor of
a more liberalized cut system
at Dayidson. We talk a great
deal about the ‘responsibility
ithat is given to the Davidson

tunity to see exactly how much
faith can be placed in the ma-
turity of the kind of men now
at Davidson.

a real step in improving and
vitalizing the quality of instruc-
tion and also the learning pro-
cess on the part of the student.
