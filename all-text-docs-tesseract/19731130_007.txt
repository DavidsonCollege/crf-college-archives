faces a long trek with her unicycle - up three flights of stairs to

her room.

‘How Do I Love Davidson,
Let Me Count The Ways’

Now that all the students
have been here at Davidson
for at least one term, we feel
that it is fair to hold a student
contest.

The contest is simple. In 25

words or less complete the

sentence: ‘I LIKE
DAVIDSON BECAUSE ...”

Keep in mind all of the
advantages this small, quaint
school has to offer. Remember
the wholesome atmosphere of
a tiny community.

Recall that here everyone
knows personally or knows of
nearly everyone else so that
people freely talk with or of
each other. There are no
personal biases or prejudices
here — we're all part of a jolly
family.

And the faculty members,
remember, are part of this

mitories because President

pay more for housing than

The extra money could be

tents. They can always try to
buy off the scholarship
tudents that are living in dor-
tories with promises of a
ride in a Cadillac for a few
nights of sleep in a dormitory.

The scholarship students
would most naturally be
placed in the tents. This
placement would occur for

two reasons. First, they could
be threatened with losing
their scholarships if they did

family group. Keep in mind
how they trust the students so
much that they allow students
totake their examsany timeof
the day ... as long as the sun
is shining.

They also respect our

the faculty meetings that they
often allow invited student
body members to attend.

We're gracious and beholding

Try to mention, in the 25
word answer, those evil
townspeople whom _ the
students have such a good
influence upon. Though the
dark ones are often naughty,
we righteously spank their
hands and scold them ‘‘poo-
poo.”

Remember the open stack,
no-check library system that
is so flawless that we never
lose more than 500 books in

any given year.

Then there is the awful town
called Mooresville to the north
that Davidson students vastly
improve by occassionally
visiting.

And of course include the
appreciated non-selective
social system that is so
respected that even off-
campus groups respect it —
though one national off
campus group traditionally
speeds up the system.

Student activities are a
major part of anyone’s reason
to appreciate and praise
Davidson. The Student
Government Association is so
well liked that upon the mere

‘mention of it, the average

student roars with laughter.

move the Student Union from

of the students will be happy
with at least one of the various
locations.

Keep in mind all of these
excellent points of
Davidsoniana. If there are any
problems, simply consult any
of the Davidson catalogues
from the past five years and
glance through them. They
will give wonderful hints
about what to appreciate and
praise.

PS. The winning entry was
just judged. I read as follows:
I LIKE DAVIDSON
BECAUSE I think that the
campus is So nice.
