-

"THERE ARE FOUR TYPES

of tobaccos found in the more popular
cigarettes,namely... Bright, Maryland,

Burley

and Turkish.

ALL THESE TOBACCOS except Turkish (which is
bought direct from the planters in Turkey and Greece)
and Maryland (which. is bought through sealed bids
under government supervision) are bought at public :
auction, just like any other auction where you might
have bought in a.table or a chair.

MAKE YOUR NEXT PACK

AT THE AUCTION SALE the tobacco is piled in
__baskets weighing from about 100 to 500 pounds and
each purchaser buys_all of his tobaccos by competitive
bidding for the particular piles he wants.

‘THE CHESTERFIELD BUYERS buy the best of

‘these mild ripe tobaccos for the Chesterfield blend.

And it is Chesterfield’s Combination ...the @ght amounts
of Burley and Bright... just enough Maryland... and
just enough Turkish—that makes the big difference
between Chesterfield and other cigarettes.

Ir IS BECAUSE of this combination
that Chesterfields are COOLER, have
a@-BETTER TASTE and are DEFINITELY
MILDER. They are made of the world’s
best cigarette tobaccos. You can’t buy
a better cigarette.
