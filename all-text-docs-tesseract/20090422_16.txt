Stanford, Duke drop ’Cats

After travelling up and down
the east coast, the women’s lacrosse
team returned to campus for its first
home game in a month. The two
games this weekend afforded no
respite for the squad, as the ’Cats
faced two top-20 opponents.

First up on Friday night was
Stanford who is currently ranked
14 on laxpower.com. As was the
case for both weekend match-ups,
the visiting team attacked early and
left no opportunity for an upset de-
cision. Stanford racked up the eve-
ning’s first 11 goals, taking com-
plete control early in the first half.
The Cardinals doubled Davidson’s
tally in ground balls, 10 to 15, and
launched 19 shots.

Anna Smith ’12 broke the
drought with an unassisted goal
23 minutes into the first half. Any
potential spark in the Wildcat of-
fense was extinguished by two
more Stanford scores before the
intermission. The superior Cardi-
nal depth, 10 subs to Davidson’s
four, enabled the guests to prevent
any morale-boosting back-to-back
scoring.

The second half drew steadily
into a drudge match, as each side
went back and forth with equal pos-
session and shot attémpts. Stanford
capitalized on six more scoring op-
portunities, while Davidson tallied
three to close the gap.

Again, Smith got things start-
ed with an unassisted goal — this
time the first in the half — just over
seven minutes into the period. Jen
Crawford ’10 and Haley Cook
”10 rounded the final tally to four,
against Stanford’s eventual 19.

Against the deluge of shots,
goalie Michelle Pav °10 grabbed
two saves. On a positive note, the
’Cats showed consistent compo-
sure on draw controls, owning that
stat column with 15 to Stanford’s
nine.

Then on Saturday afternoon,
Davidson took on Duke, laxpower’s
third-ranked program in Division
I. Coming off a loss to the North
Carolina Tar Heels, the Blue Devils
exploded out of the gates. The vis-
iting team would net 8 goals before
Cook put Davidson on the score-
board with a goal off a free position
shot. Duke continued the offensive
pressure by scoring six more in the
last 10 minutes of the first half.

In the second half, the game’s
rhythm leveled in Davidson’s fa-

vor as the ’Cats held the ball more
on offense and sent a few more to
the back of the net. Smith took on
a support role midway through the
period, feeding Callie Seymour ’09
for the team’s second goal. Their
efforts were followed by three
straight Wildcat goals, one from
Crawford and two from Cook’s
free position shots. Both Crawford
and Cook lead the team in scores
this season, with 26 and 23, respec-
tively.

Pav stifled an impressive eight
Duke shot attempts, keeping both
the score and the Wildcats’ spirits
in check.

The Blue Devil offense simply.
maintained more control, with 35
shots in the match to Davidson’s
14. The visitors held a slight ad-
vantage in ground balls, 17-12, but
dominated draw controls 17 to 7.

In both games, the ’Cats un-
doubtedly benefitted from the
experience of playing top-notch
competition. The fluidity of the
Stanford and Duke offenses, their
confidence in clearing, and their
unrelenting tenacity are aspects for
the Davidson squad to emulate.

On Tuesday, April 21, the team
got its last opportunity to show off
its development, taking on Presby-
terian in Clinton, SC in which they
proved themselves well, winning
20-9.

SoCon basketball tourneys
heading to Charlotte 1 in 2010

Ray FRANCIS
Staff Writer

The Southern Conference men’s
and women’s basketball champi-
onships will move to Charlotte in
2010, the conference announced
two weeks ago. The tournaments
were previously scheduled to take
place in Chattanooga, which played
host this year. The Tennessee city
will host again in 2011.

The move ensures that the
Charlotte area will still be the
most important site in the Southern
Conference.

The decision seeks to reduce
travel costs for teams, as Charlotte
is closer to the conference’s geo-
graphic center. ,

“We are thrilled with the oppor-
tunity to host the tournaments next
year and are looking forward to
hosting the conference, its schools
and fans in Charlotte next March,”
Mike Crum, CEO of the Charlotte
Regional Visitor’s Authority, said
in a SoCon press release.

The tournament will be held
on March 4-8, 2010. The first three
days of action will be held in Bo-
jangles Arena (seating capacity
9,605), with the semifinals and fi-
nals to take place in Time Warner

Will Archambault ’10 and the Wildcats will compete for a Southern
Conference championship in nearby Charlotte next March.

Arena, home of the Charlotte Bob-
cats (seating capacity 19,026).

“We think this is a step that
will help insure the future growth
of our basketball tournament,” So-
Con Commissioner John Iamarino
said in the same press statement.
“This decision is not a negative re-
sponse to our recent experience in
Chattanooga. On the contrary, the

tournament has had some of its best
financial outcomes and has been
run extremely well in Chattanooga,
and we’re pleased to be returning
in 2011.”

Next year’s tournament will be
the conference’s 89th, making it the
nation’s longest-running confer-
ence tournament.

No. 27 Georgia Southern sweeps Wildcats

The men’s baseball team lost
all three games in their series
against No. 27 Georgia Southern

Men’s Golf
LILBURN, GEORGIA

Michael Saari ‘o9

last weekend in Statesboro, Ga.
The team gave up a staggering 42
combined runs in three games, los-
ing 7-12, 8-20, and 2-11 on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday, respectively.
Davidson dropped to 13-20 over-
all and fell below .500 in Southern
Conference play, at 8-10, with the
series sweep.

On Friday Davidson could not
survive Georgia Southern’s sev-
en-run seventh inning onslaught.
Thomas Middour *10 made the
start for Davidson, giving up a re-
spectable three runs in six innings
of work. Georgia Southern got to
the Davidson bullpen however,
tacking on eight runs in the final
three innings.

The Davidson hitters came
alive in the ninth inning, instigat-
ed by Drew Gadaire’s ’12 leadoff
home run to left field. Jay Honey-
cutt °10 continued the rally with
a double to right center-field and
Seth Freeman ’12, Chris Fitzpatrick
’09, Will General ’11, and Graham

Hoyt sets school record at Joe

Chapman ’09 drove in four runs on
four straight hits to bring the score
to 7-12. However, Davidson could
not complete the unlikely come-
back; Gadaire grounded out in his
second at bat of the inning to end
the game.

Saturday wasn’t much better for
the Wildcats. The Wildcats trailed
by at least seven-runs all game in
the 8-20 loss and were down 1-17
after seven innings.

Chris Lamb ’12 gave up seven

runs on six hits in the first inning,

fueled mostly by Brian Pierce’s
three run double to left field. The
Davidson staff surrendered eight
extra base hits and 23 total in the
loss.

Jake Brown stifled the David-
son offense all day, tossing six in-
nings and giving up only one run
on six hits for his Georgia Southern
squad. The lineup finally rattled
the Georgia Southern staff in the
eighth, putting together another
seven-run inning.

Gadaire continued to swing
well; he hit his second home run in
as many days with a three-run shot,
scoring Zach Kayne ’09 and Chap-
man. The blast was Gadaire’s team-
leading 10th home run of the year.

Georgia Southern completed
the sweep on Sunday with a 2-11
win. Matt Web ’09 made the start
and struggled through four innings,
giving up nine runs (eight earned)
on nine hits.

Georgia Southern’s Matt Mur-
ray stifled the Davidson offense, he
scattered nine hits and surrendered
only one run in six solid innings.
The Wildcats could not buy a run
off of Murray—the lineup left 13
men on base, seven in the first three
innings.

Gadaire tried to fuel the of-
fense in the first inning; his double
to right field scored Kayne to give
Davidson the early 1-0 lead. Gad-
aire, however, would finish 1-5, fiz-
