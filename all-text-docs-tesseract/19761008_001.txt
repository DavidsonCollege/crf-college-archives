SGA makes plans for media board

By LYMAN COLLINS .
Asst. News Editor

The SGA Senate will soon
begin taking the initial steps
toward setting up a media
board to oversee student med-
ia specified in Article XI,
Section 5 of the College Con-
stitution.

The board will consist of
three students, two adminis-
trators and one faculty mem-
ber; those six will then select
three additional members from
the college community.

SGA President Bo Baskin
said that the Senate would
“probably appoint some peo-
ple next week’’ for the board.

The function of the board
will be to oversee all student
media, including the David-
sonian, Quips and Cranks,
The Miscellany, The Wildcat
Handbook and WDAV.

“One of the first things the

board -will need to do is to
draw up standards of respon-
sible journalism as a guideline
for student media,”” commen-
ted Baskin.

The media board was app-
roved by the Trustees last
May as a part of the entire
College Constitution, all of
which was approved except for
Article XII, the Statement of
Student Rights.

The idea for the board is a
direct outgrowth of Article
XII. “The media board in my
mind is very much a part of
the Statement of Student
Rights,’’ added Baskin, ‘‘I
think of them as first cou-

Vol. LXVI, No. FOUR

sins.’

Dean of Students Will Ter-
ry, in explaining why the
media board wasn’t included
in the Statement, said, ‘‘It
was the feeling of the Trustees
that anything that actually
sets up a board ought to be
separate from the section deal-
ing with student rights.

“It would be like including
the Supreme Coirt in the Bill
of Rights.”’

According to Article XI the
board authorizes college spon-
sored student media, ‘‘ap-
points and dismisses editors
and general managers; app-
roves the budgets of these

media; reviews their finances;
promailgates and periodically
reviews the standards of res-
ponsible journalism by which
the media abide; and assures
media adherence to them.’’
The board also must be con-
sulted on problems of libel.

Baskin said that the pro-
posed By-Laws for the board
clarifies the powers of the
board. The board will have
appointive powers only in
concurrence with SGA By-
Laws.

‘‘SGA policy is that there
will be elections and the board
will rubber stamp the results,”
added Baskin.

Last week’s Student Gov-
ernment Association (SGA)
Senate elections were clouded
by confusion and controversy.

The vote was delayed twice
at the direction of temporary
Election Council Chairman Ed
Rees, first to allow time for
more publicity and the second
time because of a possible
conflict between the procedure

; followed and the SGA By-

Laws.

The initial delay in publici-
zing the elections resulted
from a mistake made by Rees

Faculty deletes sentence

Faculty approves Article XII
Trustee decision pending

By CATHY LANDIS
Features Editor

Meeting on Tuesday, the
faculty approved Article XII
of the proposed College Con-
stitution. This brought to an
end the struggle for approval
that authors of the document
have been waging for two
years.

Article XII is also called
The Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities.
The draft presented to the
faculty this week was the
13th draft of the document.

The 12th draft of Article
XII was rejected by the fa-
culty last spring because it
contained what was described
as “contentious language.” A
subcommittee altered the wor-
ding and presented the revised

document to the faculty in
September.

The faculty sustained a
motion to delete one sentence
from the revised document.
The sentence was part of
section six, dealing with stu-
dent publications. The deleted
sentence read: ‘‘Student, fa-
culty, administrative, or pub-
lic disapproval of content or
editorial policy may not be the
sole grounds for removal.”

After passing the motion to
delete this sentence, the facul-
ty unanimously approved Ar-
ticle XII. It was suspected by
some members of the faculty
that the document would have
passed, though not unani-
mously, without the deletion
of the sentence.

According to SGA Presi-

eS

ment and the entire College

table. Rees commented, ‘‘I

* made an honest mistake, I
§ thought freshman senators

were elected first.’’ Actually
dorm and off-campus senators
are elected first and freshman
senators the following week.

dent Bo Baskin, the deletion
of the sentence means that the

cause for dismissing an editor
could be disapproval of his
publication’s content or edi-
torial policy. But he feels that
“such a move would be blatant
censorship. I can’t imagine a
board ever doing that,” said
Baskin.

With the faculty’s approval
Article XII will now be subject
to a student referendum

If approved by the stu-
dents, Article XII will come
before the Board of Trustees
on Friday, October 15. Appro-
val there will pass the docu-

Constitution into effect. The
trustees are expected to accept
the document.

Rees felt he needed extra
time to rectify his mistake and
informed SGA President Bo
Baskin of his intention to do
so. Baskin characterized his
initial ‘response as ‘Don’t do
that,’’ but left the final deci-
sion to Rees.

Rees explained, ‘‘My auth-
ority specifically states that I
can change dates and I did not
overstep my authority. Every-
thing I've done was with Bo
Baskin’s okay.”

Warren Soule, who was
responsible for counting the
vote for the SGA, feels that
Rees’ action broke the spirit of
the By-Laws. He stated, ‘‘The
jurisdiction of the Election
Council is to enforce the
By-Laws, not circumvent
them.”

A second delay arose when
it was discovered on election
day that a candidate’s name

An editorial

Article XIl softened
by compromise

History was made this week. The Statement of
Student Rights and Responsibilities was passed by
the faculty, freeing the document to be approved by
students and passed into effect by the Board of
Trustees. The temptation is to be facetious, to revel
in overstatement of what has happened. The truth,
as we see it, is that nothing significant has
happened. But read on and take comfort in the fact
that the opportunity to make a difference has now
fallen back to the student body where it began.

The thirteenth draft of the Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities was approved this week
after the deletion of an important sentence
concerning student publications. Does that make
the document accepted this week the.fourteenth
draft? Maybe so, but the point is that the document
originally drawn up as a statement of the way
students understood themselves as members of the
Davidson academic community has now been

He indicated that he expec-
ted little change in the elector-
ial process of selecting new
editors and general managers
for the student media.

“I expect the next election
will be run very similar to
those in the past,” he said.

As to the make-up of the —
board, Baskin said that the
selection of the student mem-
bers would be chosen in accor-
dance with SGA By-Laws,
which have yet to be deter-
mined.

‘It was my initial feeling
that no present editors ‘should

did not appear on the off-
campus ballot and that Rick
Rauck, who was also running
for an off-campus position,
was living on campus.

Baskin explained why Carol
Connor’s name was not inclu-
ded by saying, “Apparently
publicity was bad and a few
who missed the deadline for
filing were included by Ed
because they hadn’t received
adequate notice. Carol talked
to me about running and it
wasn't Ed’s fault at all that he
didy’t know she was inter-
ested ”’

Commenting on Soule’s
charge of circumventing the
By-Laws, Baskin responded,
‘Tf we did break the law the
real problem is that we miss

what our aim is. The purpose
is to get people to run, not
shut them out.”
