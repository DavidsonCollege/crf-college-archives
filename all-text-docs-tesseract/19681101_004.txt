Life In A Small-Time C

the chantp. *

(Second in A Series)
By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer

A few days ago a Southern
Conference sports writer
made the statement that
“this conference is- on its
last legs as a major colleg-
jate league. All that is left
for the conference is David-
son College basketball.”

A brash and deceptive
statement? Not at all, after
a brief look at certain statis-
tics.

With the departure of West
Virginia and Virginia Tech
from the conference, the last
shred of football prestige was
stripped from an already
weak conference.

Not since VPI's brief period
of fame in 1966 has a South.
ern team been mentioned in
the nation’s Top Ten; nor has
a conference team played in
a major bowl game. This dis-
tinction is one that very few
conferences that claim to be
“major collegiate leagues”
have.

Of course, this year the
conference champion will
win an automatic bid to a
minor bowl game, the Tan-
gerine Bow] in Orlando, Fia.

Unfortunately, the probable’

opponent ‘witt-
ion of the Mi. Arnerigan Con-
ference, once considered
weaker than the Southern.
but now boasting some of the
nation’s -most , powerful
teams.

For instance. the leading
candidate for the Southern
title, Richmond, was whipped
by a Mid-American so-so, To-
ledo. while another possible
winner, William .and Mary.
fell to Mid-American power
Ohio, 42-0.

To add injury to insult, the
Southern teams have won
just four games outside of
the conference this year
while rolling up a total of
19 losses. The four wins, fnci-
dentally, came over the ‘‘po-
tent’’ teams from Lehigh.
Connecticut, Presbyterian
and Parsons.

The records of poor show-
ing by conference teams out-
side of the conference goes
on and on. from
departures that eve
ern team (except for David-
son's basketball team) has
made from various NCAA
tournaments in recent years
to the combined record of
the conference schools in all
sports, giving the conference

wins in only 30 per cent of
its games.

The question now is this:
just where does Davidson
presently fit into this weak
conference sports program?

To be sure, Davidson has
added very little to the con-
ference in most sports. ‘‘Lets
face the facts,"* one Charlotte
sports writer said, ‘Davidson
has one helluva basketball
team that can play with any
major school. Some of the
lesser sports can hold their
own fairly well, but in cer.
tain sports your coliege is
just not-and probably never
will be of major college cali-
ber.”

“Probably the biggest ad-

MERRITT

vantage to the conference

system, at least as far as —

I'm concerned, is the sched-
uling aspect.” said tennis
and soccer coach Harry
Fogleman. ‘Otherwise, in
my sports it doesn’t mean
that much.”

Considering that the soc-

cer team plays a grand total .

of three SC teams in the
regular season and the tennis
team faces no more than
seven in about 25 matches,
Fogleman’s point of view is
understandable.

In most of the other sports
dn which Davidson fields a
team, it is the same; other
than scheduling and a few
minor points. the Southern

Wildkitten Sikes Follows
Tracks Of Wildcat Kelly

By STEVE WILLIAMS
Sports Writer

Most Davidson coaches
agree that finding a good end
of the same calibre as Wild-
cat Mike Kelly is not an easy
task. Yet it appears that
freshman Coach Gene Mc-
Ever has another one in the
growing stages.

Greg Sikes, a freshman
from Statesboro, Ga. has be-
gun to prove his ability
after three games at split
end. During this time he has
hauled in 14 passes for a
total of 286 yards.

“Greg was, off a little at
the Richmond game last
week,""’ McEver said. He
only caught four passes for
around 76 yards. but he
totaled more than 100 yards
during each of the first two
freshman games this sea-
son.

Davidson lost to Richmond
16-6.

Sikes is a quarterback’s
dream. Both of the fresh-
man quarterbacks, Rick
Kemmerlin and Rick Pipan.
find him an easy target. Both
commented that his height
was a great advantage. Sikes
is 6-4 and weighs 185 pounds.

Kemmerlin said ‘‘Greg
takes a long stride and he
is very deceptive with his
speed. He just seems to
have a natural instinct for
finding the ball once it is
thrown.”*

Pipan went on to add that
“the probably has the great-
est hands on the team. All
you have to do is put the
ball in his area and he will
come. up with it.”

In addition to his hands he
probably has one of the most
impressive records compiled
by a high school athlete.
Sikes was a four-sport letter-
man at Statesboro High
School, pulling in all-confer-
ence honors in each one.

He lettered for two years
in both baseball and track

t

The Student Store

and four years in football
and basketball. Sikes was
also selected to the Georgia
All-State squads in football
and basketball.

Topping his high school
career off he was given hon-
orable mention as a high
school All-American in both
football and basketball. He
went on to participate in the
Georgia all-star tsasketball
game. He was also selected
to play in the all-star foot-
ball game.

Coach McEver note that
“Greg isn’t as fast as we
would like him to be and he
needs to build up his should-
ers, but we have high hopes

that he will be another Mike -

Kelly.”

Sykes and the freshmen
meet the Citadel . freshmen
this afternoon. at 2 p.m.. at
Richardson Field.

The team will be running
at full strength, with the ex.
ception of offensive tackle
Greg Johnson, who sustained
a fractured forearm in prac-
tice two weeks ago. John-
son is out for the remainder
of the season.

The times keep getting
better as the Davidson cross
country teams points to the
Southern Conference champ-
ionships, which come up in
less than two weeks.

Despite their best perfor-
mances of the year, however,
the harriers still saw their
record drop to 4-6 in a five-
way meet with Appalachian,
High Point. Pembroke, and
Wake Forest on the David-
son course Monday. The
Wildcats beat only Wake
Forest. .

Newman, Louthan Shine
In Five-School Meeting

Wildcats was junior Stagg
Newman with a five-mile
time of 28:55. His time. good
for ninth place overall, re-
presented the fastest time
for a Davidson runner in two
years.

Coach Heath Whittle called
Newman's performance ‘‘a
truly outstanding job.”’

Also singled out was sopho-
more Reeves Louthan who
did a ‘‘magnificent job” ac.
cording to Whittle.

The team's consistent im-
provement is shown in their
victory over Wake Forest in
Monday‘s meet. Earlier in
the season Wake had defeat-
ed the Wildcats at the Dea-

con home course.

The state meet will be
held Monday in Raleigh
where Whitt!e and the Wild-
cats are aiming for a sixth
or seventh place finish out
of 16 schools.

He hopes the harriers will
hit their peak in the confer.
ence meet where they will
meet some of their stiffest
compétition of the year. The
meet is scheduled for Nov.
11 in Greenville, N. C.

Leading the team in these
two big meets will be New-
man, senior captain Randy
Phillips, freshman Chris
Sikes. and Louthan.

Conference has nothing to
offer thé sports program.

Perhaps the biggest case
against the conference came
last year when Lefty Dreisell
found the Wildcat basketball
team forced by conference
rules to play a preposterous.
as far as Lefty was concern-
ed — 14 - game conference
schedule. After much haggl-
ing and arguing, it was final-
ly compromised that each
conference team must play
10 other Southern teams.

“That really wasn't too
bad with West Virginia in
the conference, because they
were a good team that
would test us,’ Dreisell said.
“But when West Virginia
left. . ."° The quote was left
unfinished, but the insinua-
tion was there.

By playing 10 games with
such weak teams as_ the
Southern Conference has, the
Davidson basketball team is
limited in its chance to play

onference

there.”

“I don't know what we're
doing for the conference,”
‘said one Davidson coach,
“but it's not doing much for
us.”

Davidson is doing a lot for
the conference, according to
conference official Dallas
Shirley. ‘Every school means
a lot to us in the conference.
Davidson is no exception.
Your program is as import-
ant to the conference as any-
one else’s. The Davidson
basketball team is always a
conference power.”

For some reason, confer-
ence talk always seems to
come back to Davidson's
basketball team.

“It’s only natural that the
conference praises the Dav.
idson basketball team,” said
Dick Hammerstrom of the
Charlotte News. ‘It's really
all that the Southern Con-
ference has left in the way
of prestige. And what is a

ROCKY CROSSWHITE

A Way To Live

After reading Vince Lombardi’s book on the Green
Bay Packers and watching the summer Olympics on
television, Lefty believes he has found the way for
this year’s Wildcat basketball team to win the national
championship. It’s all in conditioning.

Although we have been practicing for only two
weeks, it seems like a month. Lefty told us that we
will rue the day the American Broadcasting Company
decided to carry the Olympics live. Between watching
the Kenyan runners sprint the last lap after running
six miles and seeing swimmers like Don Schollander
and Mark Spitz splash at full speed for 400 meters,
Lefty is convinced we can give the same kind of
effort.

| know that writing about conditioning is almost
as interesting as most of our chapel speakers, and
needless to say both tend to put me asleep. But the
next three weeks could be a gruesome experience for
the Davidson team. Lefty’s final words, “I’m going to
show you just how out of shape you all are,” could be
the end of some of us. ;

The conditioning might not be as bad as most of
us think. With 16 players onthe team right now, it’s
not as hard to hide as it has been in the past. Still,
this scheme has it’s drawbacks due to the closed circuit
TV that Lefty runs during most of the practices. We
may be able to rest without the coaches knowing it but
that “big brother” machine could get us in the end.

Practices now begin with a variety of medicine
ball exercises followed by calisthenics and agility
drills. After this we usually have several defensive
drills and some spot shooting. Then, teams are divided
up with the black shirts (this year’s skins) working
against the red shirts. After various other drills, Lefty
lets most of us go.

Those who are lucky enough to be chosen to stay
are players that Lefty feels are unduly out of shape
and need more work. It’s usually the same two or three
players and they run suicide drills, skip rope, do push-
ups, and various other healthful activities. A suicide
drill consists of sprinting to quartercourt and back,
halfcourt and back, three-quarters court and back,
and full court and back. These players have been
dubbed the “sub-par boys” or the “kamikazi squad”
for apparent reasons. Lefty calls them his “‘extracur-
ricular gang.”

Speaking of conditioning, Lefty received a letter
from Rodney Knowles, one of last year’s “sub-par boys”
now with the Phoenix Suns. In talking about the rigors
of professional. basketball, Rodney came out with a
classic statement, “You have to love it.” Lefty com-
mented that it was too bad Rodney didn’t know that
four years ago. Knowles has two points in two games
so far while Dick Snyder, another former Wildcat
player now with the Suns, had 20 and 26 points in his
first two games.

Still, despite all the emphasis on conditioning
Lefty has promised us several Saturdays off if we work
hard in practice and look good. I sure hope we do well
because I believe some of us will need the extra day
to recuperate. I know I will.

Davidson Meets
Citadel Saturday

The Citadel brings a pro-
set offense and an upset de.
fense to Charlotte tomorrow
for a Southern Conference
meeting with Davidson at
Memorial Stadium.

The offense features the
running power of Jim Mc-
Millan, who has carried 101
times this season for 425
yards.

The defense, however, is
in poor shape after last
week's 39-0 loss to Chattan-
ooga. All-American _line-
backer John Small suffered
a concussion in the contest
and is out for the season with
a pinched nerve and bruis-
ed spine.

Small's depafture brings
added misery to the squad,
which had already lost its
other starting linebacker
Jackie Zorn to a neck injury.
Citadel Coach Red Parker is
faced with replacing the
tough pair from an inexper-
ienced group.

The losses will greatly
hamper the defensive power,
as Small and Zorn were rated
as the toughest linebacking
duo in the South.

Quarterback Tony Pass-

ander has 42 completions in.

An interesting study of The
Citadel's effectiveness in

ing outscored their oppon-
ents in that quarter, 36-0.

Hannen Returns
To Halfback Spot

George Hannen has: be-
came a movable fixture on
the Wildcat football team
this season.

After starting the season
and playing for four games
at halfback, he moved to his
former Davidson position at
end. The move pushed sop-
homore sprinter Rick Lyon
into the ‘Cat backfield.

Lyon, however, reinjured
his leg in the Furman game,
and is out of the Davidson
line-up again, so Hannen has
been moved back to the half-
back spot by Coach Homer
Smith.

Hannen's__ return to the

backfield makes room at the
end spot for sophomore Rusty
Lawrence, the second lead-
ing ‘Cat receiver.
