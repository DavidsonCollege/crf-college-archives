Boxing Tournament Is

To Be Held In Spring

The annual intramural boxing tourna-
ment has been scheduled to take place
sometime during the first week in March.
An exact date has not been decided upon,
but it 4vill be set sometime in the near
future.

The tournament will last two days, the
preliminary matches being fought on one
night and the finals on the next. All
contestants will be divided into seven
classes, according to weight, and hand-

some medals will be awarded to the win-

ner in each class. The medals are now
on exhibition in the trophy case in the
lobby of Chambers building.

The different weights will be divided
as follows: 120 pound, 130 pound, 140
pound, 150 pound, 160 pound, 175 pound,
and unlimited classes. Due to * this
complete weight classification all matches
will be more or less even.

Entries will not be made until a few
days before the tournament, but Capt.
N. G. Pritchett urges all men intending
to enter the tournament to attend his
daily class in boxing, which is held on
the second floor of the old gymnasium
every afternoon from 4:30 to 6 o'clock.
A number of candidates for fistic hon-
ors have been working out ,daily for
some time.

Showing Scientific Film

A talking picture, “The Arrangement
of Atoms and Molecules in Crystals,”
was viewed by approximately one hun-
dred and twenty-five students in the Mar-
tin Chemistry building, Tuesday, Jan-
uary 29.

Sir William Bragg, noted English
scientist, directed the production of this
three and one-half reel picture. He
presents a story about the construction
of crystals with special reference to
carbon. Dr. Bragg explained with sev-
eral models, the construction and ar-
rangement of atoms in molecules.

A capacity audience at the first show-
ing of the films necessitated a second
show to be held for the college students.
Only students taking chemistry or phy-
sic courses were admitted, due to the
small seating capacity of the lecture
room.

The films were obtained through the
courtesy of the General Electric Com-
pany, free of charges, except for the
cost of transportation.

pected.

rather than to return to Tennessee, his
alma mater.

This news bulletin was followed by
the playing of William Tell Overture, by
Rossini, the highlight of the program.

The program was announced by
Moreland Cunningham.

Two Address Sigma Pi
Sigma At Club Meeting

Sigma Pi Sigma, national physics fra-
ternity, held its regular bi-monthly
meeting Monday night and discussed
future plan§ for the club.

Speakers for the occasion were John
Willis, who spoke on “Ether” and W.
P. Creech who selected the paradoxical
subject, “Accomplishing Something by
Doing Nothing.”

Willis discussed the qualities of ether
aiid the part that it had played since
it had been discovered. Creech showed
that certain gasses, notably Argon, were
inert but were necessary in the operation
of the incandescent lamp. “If they were
active,” said Willis*in considering the
gases, “they would be useless.”

$72,000 Set As Value
Of College Education

Only two boys out of every hundred
receive four years of college education,
according to the statistics compiled by
a leading insurance executive.

The value of an education was pointed
out by the executive, who cited some
statistics of the Massachusetts depart-
ment of labor and the college of busi-
ness administration of Boston Univer-
sity. The cash value of a college edu-
cation was set by the statistics at $72,000.
The total earnings of a college grad-
uate from 22 to 60 average $150,000.

“When a boy goes to work at 14,” says
the executive, “he reaches his maximum
income at thirty, earning less than $1,200
a year. As his income depends largely
upon manual dexterity, and physical
strength, his income falls off gradually
after he is fifty.

“The high school graduate goes to
work at 18, and passes the maximum of
the untrained man within seven years,
rising steadily to his maximum of $2,200
at 40. He continues at that level the
remainder of his active life. His total
additional earnings make the cash value
of his high school education $33,000 more
than the untrained man.

“In the case of a college trained man,
he doesn’t start permanent earnings .un-
til he is 22. By the time he is 28, his
income equals that of the high school
graduate at 40, and continues to rise
without a break.

“The great difference is that. the col-
lege trained man’s income is dependent
upon his mental ability, and training
constantly improves it by practice. ‘With
an average income of $150,000 total in-
come between 22 and 60, the college
education is worth $72,000 more than
just a high school education.”

Plans for a meeting with Phi Beta Chi,
scientific fraternity, at Queens-Chicora
College in the near future were discussed
with much relish and the choosing of
speaker for the occasion was considered.
Gamma Sigma Epsilon, chemistry fra-
ternity represented at Davidson, will act
jointly with Sigma Pi Sigma in this ven-
ture.

wide variety of shadings. Being a man
of the day, he thinks in the modern
idiom and plays the music with instinc-
tive appreciation for its meaning. There
was poetic imagination and bravura bril-
liance. A young artist of genuine

grew as a lecturer and he has now lec-
tured in most of the larger schools of
the country. He holds at present a posi-
tion on the faculty at Princeton Univer-
sity.

“The conference is indeed fortunate
in securing Dr. Nathan for this occas-
ion,” stated President Charles Lucas in
commenting upon the speaker.

Lucas announced the selection of three
important committees who will handle
phases of the coming convention. Lamont
Brown was chosen chairman of the place-
ment committee and will be assisted by
Wilbur Edwards, Don Bailey, Paul Har-
lan and Harold Sugg. This committee
will be in charge of finding places for
the 200 delegates expected.

Warner DuBose will be in charge of
Registration and Mims Rogers will head
the Entertainment Committee. Assist-
ants for these two will be selected later,
announced Lucas. Several will be busy
ushering the delegates around to their
places and it is possible that the David-
son Boy Scouts will be used for that pur-
pose.

Those initiated at the meeting include:
Wade Boggs, Carleton Chapman, Camer-
on Deans, Wilbur Edwards, Gordon
Green, Paul Harlan, Edwin Holt, Blan-
ton Little, Bob Lindsey, Tyler Port,
Harold Sugg, A. C. Stutts and Tom Sut-
ton.

Lamont Brown, Tom Downie, John
Newton and Hugh Yelverton were not
present for the initiation and will be
initiated in the near future.

Presbyterian Church. The occasion was
the monthly special meeting- of men’s
group.

A, A. Gammon of the Students Vol-
unteer Union in co-operation with the Y
went across the tracks to the Unity
Church Sunday to talk on Mission Work
in Brazil.

Mr. Gammon was born in Brazil and
received his preparatory education in
Brazilian schools and is in position to
give a first hand description of actual
conditions in that great South American
country. ‘To add to the interest of the
talk, Mr. Gammon showed a large num-
ber of slides depicting life in Brazil.

Next Sunday deputations have been
planned to the Front Street Presbyterian
Church in Statesville, where representa-
tives are sent quite frequently, and to
the Prison Camp near Huntersville,
where representatives are ‘sent nearly
every Sunday except the first in the
month.

pecuniary support. In view of these con-
ditions, the publications board felt that
it was not advisable henceforth to pub-
lish a yearbook in the name of Davidson
College which would not be thoroughly
worthy of the institution’s other activi-
ties.

It was hoped that these measures would
arouse the men who have not thus far
paid their visit to the annual’s photo-
graphing studio to do so at once, and
that the situation which has developed
might thus be remedied as far as the
present term is concerned.

Scientific Pictures
To Be Shown

Chemistry Building. Scientific motion
picture films are obtained from Ethyl-
Dow Chemical Company, General Elec-
tric Company and other manufacturers
of chemical products, free of charge, ex-
cept for the cost of transportation.

At present only physic and chemistry
students are allowed to attend these film
showings. Students are requested to at-
tend these shows on time and to remain
through the entire presentation of one or
both pictures.

Satisfactory arrangements are in prog-
ress to obtain adequate sound effects in
Chambers auditorium so that all scientific
inclined students will be afforded an op-
portunity to attend these showings.

School, losing also to Paw Creek, Bel-
mont Abbey and the Tar Babies from

the University of North Carolina.
Playing a fast game against an out-
classed team, the Freshmen ran up a
48-6 score against Davidson High School
Thursday night in the College Gym-
nasium. Lawrence Reid, Captain Bar-
row, Keiswetter and Harris figured
highly in this barrage of field goals, and
for the High team, Graham and McLain

did well.
