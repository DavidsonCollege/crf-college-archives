Dean of Students Puts Frat on Double Secret Probation
SPEs Shoot and Mortally Wound Pledge During Annual Shootout

By Harvey Dimple

On Thursday, April 26, a
brother of the Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity was shot and killed dur-
ing the Second Annual “SPE
Shoot.”

In the incident, freshman
Alfredo Urbino, an international
student from Venezuela, was

- blown to bits.

The Dean of Students has sus-
pended all social activities at SPE
until further notice and placed the

- fraternity on double secret proba-
tion.

Dean of Students Will Terry
said thatthe Dean’s Office hasalso
set up a Review Committee to de-
termine “the culpability of the fra-
ternity as an organization in this
event.”

According to a police report,
atapproximately 5:30 pmon Thurs-
day, all SPE brothers gathered at
their Patterson Court house for the
“Shoot Out.”

A SPE brother, who asked to
remain anonymous, explained the
activity: “Once a year, we SPEs
think it’s neat and cool to get to-
gether and shoot paint pellets at

16s which the cadets had set next
to the harmless paint guns. They
aimed point-blank at the unsus-
pecting Urbino and shot.

An ambulance was sum-
moned, but Urbino was pro-
nounced dead on the scene of mul-
tiple, close-range gunshot wounds.

As one SPE present at the in-
cident aptly summed up, “Oops.”

Services for Urbino were held
at DCPC on Sunday. He is sur-
vived by his father, mother, and
two sisters. :

The tragedy occurred just two
weeks after Urbino, affectionately

known as “Roadkill” by friends,

was dropped on his head in the
laundry parking lot during an at-
tempted road trip.

Patterson Court Advisor Kurt
Holmes said thatas of yet the Dean
of Students Office is dealing with
the problem, pending evidencethat

could lead to CCRL or Honor
Council involvement.

The students involved in the
shooting have been issued a sum-
mons by the Dean of Students Of
which reads, in part, “... students

In a somewhat bizzarre, but
progressive move, Davidson Col-
lege admitted its first-alien stu-
dents this past week. The four
Students, Garkmel
Schmeilinheimer, Matt
Bumstead, Laura Dennis, and Sa-
rah Gayle, all hail from P486III, a
small, hydrogen-based planet in
the Andromeda Galaxy.

Bumstead said the following
of his acceptance, “I’m pretty ex-
cited because I hear the school
paper might just be stupid enough
to let me write a very long, very
boring column extolling the vir-

one another. It’s kind of like that
carnival game... Each brother take¥
atumrunning back and forth while
five others shoot at him at close
range: It’s fun.”

This year, the fun backfired.

The police report continues:
Urbino was the first to volunteer as
atarget. He donned his protective
helmet and pads-and-went-to the
back of the house, where he.waited
to be pelted.

Apparently, some SPE broth-
ers who are ROTC cadets (there
seem to be quite a lot) had run
straight from maneuvers to the
house, so as not to be late for the
fun.

The first-round marksmen
mistakenly grabbed the loaded M-

tués of Country music. On ;
we’ve grown light years ahead of
this dribble that these no talents
call music, but hey, you haven’t.”
As forthe other threealiens,
they all share a primary goal. “We
want to stop the offensive stereo-
typing of Alien-Americans and
help the college learn to tolerate
peoples ofdifferentcultures,” says
Schmeilinheimer. “We're tired
of being called ugly just because
we don’t look like humans.” -
Whenasked about how these
chosen few were accepted, Ad-
missions head Nancy Cable Wells
commented; “Basically we see
this as an excellent opportunity.
We were able to do the same thing
with women and African-Ameri-
cans decades ago. Basically, we

just want to make sure that the

. white boys know who their going

to have to deal with in the real
world. If they don’t know how
these people act, how are they go-
ing to know how to control them.

Hey, isn’t that what a liberal arts °

education is all about, anyway?”
The students will be living in

Richardson, but they are all going
toroom together. As forthatmove,
head of Residence Life, Dick Terry
pointed out that “we don’t know
anything about these people. For
all we know, they may just crap on
the floor.”

For those interested, the stu-
dents will be arriving on campus

three days prior to the beginning
of next years classes. If you: want
you can line'up along the path to
Rich and stare and gauk at them
until your faces fall off. And, yes
fellows, the breasts on the girl on

Editor Surprised With Academy Awards

By Bells Wack

Editor-in-chief, Harrison Rob-
erts, formerly of the Davidsonian,
was surprised to win both best sup-
porting actor, best director, and
best animal trainer, for his movie
Back Door Barney. The film,
which stars Roberts as himself and
a large German Shephard as

Barney, was the first independent
winner of the best picture award
ever! ,

When asked what he thought
of his surprise recognition, Rob-
erts slammed a PBR and puked.
Then he added, "What?"

But despite his complete lack
of knowledge of what was going

on, telegrams have been Hooding
into the
country ask- —
ing, "Who
the hell is
Harrison
Roberts?"
The Acad- -
emy insists that they know and

have been quoted saying. "We're
right! We're right! He won the
damn things!"

At a recogniton party this
morning, Roberts announced that
he will be producing a new film
based on his donkey, Odie. The
movie is currently titled, Donkey
Odie.

SAE Back K on Campus; Tree to be New House

a

After months of torture living
in their rat infested Thompson
Street home, the SAE's are backon
campus. Unfortunately, they have
no House. Said Anthony Foxx,
head of the Committee to Decide
Whether SAE is a Bunch of Sin-
ners, said this: "Well, they've been
doing alot. Imean the seven books
they donated are really making the
library alot better, and Iuse they're

stupid calendar every day."

So the SAEs will be returning
to campus next fall. They won't,
however, be allowed to rush, walk
through the front doors of Cham-
bers, or eat anywhere besides in
the bathrooms of the Commons.
Said President Norwood, "Hey, it's
a step!"- (Actually, he may not be
president, but nobody knows who
is anyway.)
