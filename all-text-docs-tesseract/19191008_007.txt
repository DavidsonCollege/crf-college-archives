Did it Rain Saturday Night?
Ask Watts

It Never Rains But it Pours—Watts
Gets Thorough Bath

The inter-dormitory water fights open-
ed with a splash. “The dormitories were
full of pride challenging each to each"
and each, as it seems, called the other's
bluff. Saturday night from 10 until 11
was the time: Watts, Rumple and:
Chambers the scenes of watering. |

On the tick of ten by Bitzer’s Inger-
soll third floor Watts cut loose on Geor-
gia with paper bags. The response was
most gratifying and an expedition for
revenge was organized in a concise time.
The upperest berths of the pivotal struc-
ture were dewly attacke and irrigated.
By some miracle the showers in Watts
were still provided with hot water and
the same was provided, not a la mode,
for the assailants. However, the Geor-
gians soon held the floors and Watts fell
from her lofty citadel.

The combined forces of dormitories
2 and 3 next fell on Rumple. Rumple
fell on her knees, with the exception of’
-one or two Fresh, who put up a plucky
but unlucky resistance. The staff re-
porter present went up to the hall of
conflict to get information. He got
drowned. Scon the famous weanie,
weechy, etc., message of Caesar was sent
back to headquarters by the invaders.

middle of April.

She was weeping bitter tears into her
afternoon tea.

“Oh, my dear!” she said to her only
friend, “I do not know what I shall
do. Ted and I have only been married
six months, yet he spends every evening
at his club.” !

“Well, do not worry, darling,” seid
the other. “Percy is just the same. But
I shall never scold him again for spend-
ing so much time at his club.”

“Why not?”

“Weill, last night a burglar got in
the house and my husband knocked him
senseless with a poker. I have heard
several men speak of him as a poker ex-,
pert. He has evidently been practicing |
at the club for such an emergency.” |

SCRAPPY THIS YEAR.

| With a bunch of about 40 men out
for basketball, all of whom are working
hard, there is no doubt but that there!
will be seme good, scrappy games be-
'tween the classes in the near future. .
-The fellows have been practicing from
the day the ball came, about two weeks '

The senior team will need some re-:
plenishing this year, as Chalmers and
Prep. Hall joined the varsity last year.
McAlister is playing football and Cald- ;

mie Hawkins, who formerly played
good ball. is ready to fill one of the va-
cancies. Askew and Craig are the only:

‘play.
The junior team gave

up Schenck

‘and Harrington to the varsity last year. '

There are some enterprising juniors who !
are working for the vacancies, Oltman
and King are both good players. Brice, !
A. P. Ormond and Finley are last year’s :
plavers who are eligible.

The Sophs’ ranks were not broken by
the varsity claiming any of them, yet
Denny, one of their best forwards, is:
not in college. The other four, who
are Doubles, A. C. Ormond, Cornelson
and J. P. Price, are ready for work.
The Erwin brothers are showing up
well.

The Fresh have never rounded their
team into shape as yet. They have some
good men out and no doubt they will
put out a strong team. Some of their
best players are Crawford. Covington,
Dick, Toney, Mauze and Sorrells.

Mrs. Geo. V. Zeigler and Mr. and
Mrs. W. L. Moceley and son, of Or-

SPLENDID TALENT
COMING HERE ON
LYCEUM COURSE

Sale of Season Tickets
Should Be Large.

ATTRACTIONS WELL SELECTED

Numbers Will Be Both Inspiring
and Enjoyable—Course Is
a Community Asset.

An excellent Mst of attractions has
been selected for the Lyceum Course
here this senson, and the sale of sea-
son tickets should be unusually large.

Reports from the well-known Red-
path Bureau, from which the attrac
tions on the course were secured, stnte
that never before have so many com-
munities arranged for Lyceum courses.
People everywhere are welcoming the
great opportunity offered by the Lyce-
um for good, clean entertainment and
lectures of an {nspirational and au-
thoritative character.

A Lyceum course is certainly an as-
set to any community. It brings to the
community men of note to talk on im-
portant themes, and it also furnishes
music, song and story of high stand-
ard. The Lyceum cannot but make for
better citizenship.

The local course has been carefully
selected, and the attractions will be
found to be both Inspiring and enjoy-
able. The different numbers may be
briefly described as follows:

RICH-WERNO ENTERTAINERS.

Miss Rita Rich and Miss Laura
Werno, who entertained and delighted
Lyceum audiences as members of Tho
Killarney Girls company, have been
engaged by the Redpath Bureau to ap-
pear together as a new company to
be known as the Rich-Werno Enter
tainers.

As the Dublin Girls, Miss Rich and
Mies Werno have just recently toured
one of the big Redpath Chautauqua
circuits and their programs have ev-

| srywhere been most cordially received.
In selecting a name for these enter-

RICH-WERNO ENTERTAINERS.

tainers it was at first thought that The
Dubiin Girls should be retained as a
title, but because thelr program in-
cludes songs, stories and impersona-

tlons of many other peoples besides .

the natives of the Emerald Isle, it was
decided that the company should de-
rive its name from its own membere—
Miss Rich and Mies Werno.

Miss Rita Rich immediately wins |

the hearts of her audiences. She ts
well known for her impersonations of
children and also as an impersonator
of the grown-ups of many countries.
As a singer, in appropriate costumes,
of the folk songs of various nations
she wins enthusiastic commendation.

Miss Laura Wesno, reader, pianist
and singer, hos appeared in public

ever since she was eight years old as -

a reader of dialect selections. She is
a clever planologist and her character
songs always win a hearty reception.
