By JULIE GIBERT
Staff Correspondent ;

Center for Special Studies
Dean Robert Avinger an-
nounced today that $1000
grants will be awarded to four
students this summer.

The students will study the
impact of urban areas of sur-
rounding small towns.

The grants will be awarded as
part of a program entitled ‘‘on
the City’s Rim: Small Towns
Responding to the Prospects of
Urban Growth.” The program
began last spring when the
Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company awarded the Center a
$6000 grant to fund research by
five students over the course of
two academic years.

Students participating in the
program will recieve a grant of
$1000 to fund approximatley
two months of summer research
and study. This research, which
must focus on ‘some issue
related to urbanization and
small town identity,’’ according
to Avinger, will be supervised
by a member of the Davidson
faculty.

One grant was awarded last
summer, leaving four grants
available for students who with
to study in the summer of 1979.

Selection of students to re-
cieve the four grants will take
place during spring term.~A
student need not be a current
member of the Center for Spe-
cial Studies to apply.

Although no academic credit
will be given for the profect,
Avinger hopes that ‘‘the. stu-
dent will use this, research and
study as a basis for further
work of an academic nature.”

future years if it is successful.

SGA President Bruce Brown
hopes that the special weekend
will catalyze their interest by
offering personal attention from
faculty and students.

According to SGA President
Bruce Brown, ‘‘We’re most
concerned about attracting the
cream of the crop, those who are
the first batch to be accepted,
and who frequently decide to go
elsewhere.”’

Currently, the Admissions
Department enrolls approxima-
tely six percent of those appli-
cants who are accepted. During
March, when the first letters of
acceptance go out, approxima-
tely 300 people are notified. Yet
only 34 percent of these stu-
dents decide to attend David-
son.

The program will be funded
by $1000 from the Admissions
Office and $500 from the SGA.
The money will cover food and
publicity expenses.

Main events will include a
series of mini-courses informing
prospective students about pos-
sible avenues of study and a
field day with upperclassmen to
acquaint prospectives with Pat-
terson Court.

Service Corps public policy dis-
cussion at 7:00 Thursday night
in the Center for Special Stu-
dies. The discussion is open to
the public.

At 10 am on Friday, all
juniors interested in applying
for Watson Fellowships next
year can discuss the program
with several of the former
Fellows in the Morrison Room
of the Union.

Residence hall
rules suspended

By KEITH HEARLE
Staff Correspondent

The Student Government
Association voted recently to
suspend the Residence Hall
By-Laws, which serve as the
charter for the Residence Hall
Council, to permit reorganiza-
tion of the Council on a two year
trial basis.

The Council was originally
formed to work with Housing
Director Scotty Nicholls on
dorm problems. According to
SGA Vice President John Jack-
son, who initiated the proposal,
the Council has been generally
ineffective during its seven year
existence because of lack of
interest and direction.

The new Council will handle
the purchase of dorm cleaning
and recreational equipment,
and investigate reports of van-
dalism and violations of the
Code of Responsibility. It will
also work on solving problems
with the room lottery, and will
aid Nicholls in enforcing hou-
sing regulations.

The Council includes five
members appointed from the
student body, all dorm mana-
gers, and the SGA Vice Presi-
dent. During the trial period,
the. five student members will
be appointed by the Dean of
Students, the Housing Direc-
tor, and the SGA Vice Presi-
dent to ensure their competancy
and interest.

The revitalized Council will
be re-evaluated after the two
year trial period to gauge its
effectiveness.

Clarifications

An article on college radio
station WDAV on the front
page identified Mr. Don Lovell
as the station’s director. Lo-
vell’s current title is ‘‘part-time
Community Relations Co-ordi-
nator.”

Two sentences were unknow-
ingly fused in last week’s edito-
rial on History Professor Jona-
than Boulton, to create a new
sentence of some embarassment
to this newspaper.

The paragraph as it read: ‘‘In
the first place Boulton has
spent about half his time tea-
ching Humanities and history
survey courses which usually
attract a dozen students and
have never attracted fewer than
six.”

The paragraph as it was
written: ‘‘In the first place,
Boulton has spent about half
his time teaching Humanities
and history survey courses,
both of which have naturally

filled up. As for his medieval
history courses, they usually
attract about a dozen students
and have never attracted fewer
than six.”
