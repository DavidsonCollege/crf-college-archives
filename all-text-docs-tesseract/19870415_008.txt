Dynamic ZooStory plays tonight in

By TIM JACKS

If everyone lives in their own
little world, then Edward Albee’s
The Zoo Story is an illustration of
what happens when one world in-
vades another. The Zoo Story is a
very well done offbeat student
production directed by Wayne
Magruder. It is being presented in
the intimate setting of the 900
room on April 15 at 7:00 p.m. dur-
ing the space of one hour. The au-
dience watches the: lives of two
men, Jerry and Peter, unravel in
peaceful Central Park.

Peter, played by Randy In-
gram, is a middle-aged man witha
wife, two daughters and two
parakeets, who.comes to read on

his park bench regularly. Michael
Gross plays Jerry, whose light
colored clothes and hair contrast
with Peter’s dark hair and dark
three-piece suit which sharply ac-
cents the opposition of their per-
sonalities. (One is reminded of
yin-yang opposition in their ap-
pearance.) Jerry is poor and un-
educated while Peter is middle-
class and enjoys reading.

> Magruder’s staging helps to
further the distinction between the
two men: Jerry stands or walks
around bouncing his tennis ball
while, Peter sits quietly on his
bench. Ingram’s style of subtle
movement: makes Peter seem
realistic and believable. His ex-

pressions make his character dy-
namic and prevent him from be-
coming part of the set. Gross de-
livers Jerry’s thoughts with force
and enthusiasm. With his voice
and his actions, he gradually in-
creases the tension of the play,
culminating in the insanity of the
conclusion, in which both actors
‘excel. The duo that Magruder cast
work well together.

The dialogue is based on
Jerry’s need to talk to somebody.
Jerry begins a conversation with
Peter, asking Peter questions that
Jerry would like to be asked of
himself. Even though at first Jerry
seems simple, he knows more
about Peter’s unhappiness at

home than Peter will admit to him-
self. They both need to talk to
somebody, but Jerry is more ver-
bal than Peter.

The subjects of conversation
become more complex as Jerry
talks about the Zoo, his house, his
dead parents, sex, love, and God.
A gradual reversal of opposites
takes place as Jerry’s honesty , in-
creasingly detailed story-telling
and sarcasm make Peter look sim-
ple.

The dialogue gradually builds
up to the point where Jerry is exp-
laining his own intriguing philos-

“ophy on life. “We have to know

the effect of our actions!” he sh-
outs. He believes that it is not im-

portant whether or not one loves
or hates someone, but only
whether or not one ‘makes con-
tact’ with someone. Kindness and
cruelty in and of themselves are
not important. It is what those val-
ues teach about reality that is
_meaningful. Magruder definitely
chose a thought-provoking play.
Jerry becomes fed up when
,Peter does not understand and he
intrudes deeper into Peter’s world
by taking over the park bench in
order to make Peter. understand.
Jerry ‘wins’ the bench in a stun-
ning climax and Peter’s last line
describes the horror of the revela-
tion: “Oh my God . . . ” Double >
