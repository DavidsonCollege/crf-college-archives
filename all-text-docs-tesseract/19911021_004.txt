Talk Show Hosts Verbally Abuse Homeless

By Tom Koonce
The following is part of the
transcript between Beth Mitchell
and the WCNT 1480 am morning
talk show hosts Brad McGuffin
and Matt Clark:

McGuffin: Beth, good morning
my name is Mark McGuffin, now
I am a Cornelite I live just across
the tracks over there in Cornelius
from you in Davidson. To the best
of my knowledge there is not a
great homeless situation in the twin
cities of Davidson and Cornelius,
but in Charlotte you got more pan-
handlers than youcan shake a stick
at. Now why don’t y’all get a bus
or something like that and go
sleep down on Tryon Street or
something like that.

Mitchell: Well, if we had the time
and resources we would try and do
that, but..

McGuffin: Well, you want to make
a statement right?

Mitchell: Right.

McGuffin: You want to get chan-
nel nine, channel three, channel
thirty-six. That,I mean that’s, let’s
think about this, you know up there
in Davidson its going tobe more
like an outdoor slumber party with
a bunch of kids who are going

to skip class the next day ‘cause
they’re so groggy from staying up
and drinking cheap wine and ciga-
rettes and stuff.

Mitchell: Umm, | hope not.

McGuffin: Well, I mean I was in
college, Imean daggone, you know
whenever we spent the night out
on the grass it was usually passed
out or in some other, uh, fun thing,
and I mean I’m not saying its not
going to draw attention to it butuh,
you know...

Clarke: It’s8:47, our guestis Beth
Mitchell. She’s a publicist for the

student service organization for
Davidson College and this coming
Wednesday they are planning a
big sleep out to add awareness, to
heighten awareness for the home-
less problem. My question Beth is
that, this is in all sincerity, I’m
being completely honestand don’t
take it the wrong way, but why not
just give these people a, aah, what’s
the term I’m looking for, a copy of
the classified ads and find these
people a job.

McGuffin: They don’t want to
work Matt.

Clarke: Well, I know they don’t
want to work but instead of sleep-
ing out, those people are choosing
to sleep out. I know for a fact be-
cause I lived in New York in the
summer of ’89 and dealt with a lot
of pan-handlers every day on the
way to work. I took the subway
down to Wall Street every morn-
ing and I dealt with these people
and a lot of them make thirty to
fifty a year, pan-handling. My
question is why not, instead of
sleeping out and mimicking their
behavior, why not give these people
an opportunity and give them a
job, find them a job instead of
sleeping out on the grass at

_Davidson.

Mitchell: Well, we have twocom-
mittees on campus that are for
hunger awareness and for home-
lessness and they are involved with
organizations in Charlotte that ac-
tually try and do that. They try and
give these people job skills, they
try and teach them how to read,
and provide daycare for them if
they have children and need to go
to work. We have people involved
with all those specific things. Per-
sonally, from my point of view I
think there are a percentage of
people out there thatare truly home-
less. I mean I know people who
have worked with them and been
on the streets with them. I know
that they actually experience this

——

problem,-and those are the people
that we are trying to reach, I don’t
think we are trying to reach the va-
cationers. We’re trying to reach
the truly homeless. (Beth went on
to explain about the various dif-
ferent days of ‘Into the Streets.’)

McGuffin or Clarke: Now do you
have a day targeted to go down to
the Greyhound _— StationonTrade
Street and talk to some of those
bums that hang out down _ there?

Mitchell: No, we didn’ thave time
to plan stuff like that.

McGuffin: Let me give you an
example Beth. I work at another
radio station on the weekends here
intownas, I hate this term, as adisc
jockey, sounds like some kind of
contagious disease, any way, I went
in Saturday morning andI g o t
there at five-thirty in the morning
and the station is in downtown
Charlotte. At five-thirty in the
morning I pulled into the parking
lot and here’s some bum pan-han-
dling me out ofmoney. Now, to
keep him from beating his head
against the door for four hours
while I’m on the air in thatradio
station, I gave him a handful of
change to get him off my back.

Clarke: Loser.

McGuffin: Well, my point being
that, you know, its nice to be on the
front lawn at Davidson. I hope the
weather cooperates, but daggone it
you got to get down here into the
“Queen City”wher2 we’ve got a

lotof homeless people and make:

your point down here, I think. And

maybe you could get one of these -

TV types to hang out with you and
do one of those human interest
stories that they like to do so well.

Mitchell: Well, we’ ll take thatinto
consideration, like I said we have
committees that plan activities all
year long. But we have to start

small, and knowing this time of
year with students, we’re trying to
be realistic and actually get people
that will come out.

McGuffin: Well I can understand
that.

Clarke: Beth, are you a student at
Davidson?

Mitchell: Yes, I’m a senior.
Clarke: Well, where are you from?
I’m from York, South

Mitchell :
Carolina.

McGuffin: Down Yorkway, that’s
great. Beth, thanks for your time
this morning.

Mitchell: Oh, you’re welcome.

(McGuffin and Clark hung-up with
Mitchell and then explained why.
Mitchell was interviewed)

Clark: So Mark if you’re driving
home, back to Cornelius Wednes-
day night, don’t freak out if you
see five or ten people in khakis,
button-downs and blue blazers and
Weeguns and no socks sleeping all
over the lawn. There probably
hasn't been a murder, don’t forget
this is a sleep out.

McGuffin: Yeah, I think!I’m going
to go streaking. I think I’m going
to streak through the quad man at
Davidson.

Clarke: Oh, what a crock man,
what a crock.

McGuffin: Davidson is a fine in-
stitution, I wish that more schools
were like Davidson. They really
have good academic standards up
there.

Clarke: But whata crock, though.
The way to help the homeless is to,
in my opinion...

McGuffin: Hit them in the head?

Clarke: ...is to help them geta job.
McGuffin: No, my opinion is to
just give them a little money and
they’ ll go away.

Clarke: That’s the short term so-
lution.

‘McGuffin: Well that’s the only

solution, its the practical solution.

Clarke: I was speaking about New
York a second ago, when I was
living up there.

I was new in town. For about
the first three or four weeks the
topic in the office was always bums
and my astonishment at their au-
dacity to beg for money. And,
finally one of the guys who had
been in New York, lived in

Jersey, and was actually born
in Jersey and had lived in New
York all his life _ said, ‘Man, you
actually give these people money.’
And that was the first step to
becoming, I guess a New Yorker,

- was tocompletely ignore the bums

because if you have whatit takes to
walk by these guys and Mark, I’m
not kidding, some of these people
were just plain pitiful...

McGuffin: Well they are pitiful... ’

Clarke: We’re talking nasty, dirty
living on the sidewalks.

McGuffin: ...but Matt this is not
New York, this ain’t no party, this
ain’t no disco, this ain’t no fooling
around, this is Charlotte, North
Carolina and I got nothing against
somebody that wants to beg for
money. If they have no self-es-
teem, if they have no, noprideatall
and they want to beg for money I
admire people like that. Anybody
who’s got the guts to walk up to
somebody inthe parking lot at
five-thirty in the morning and pan-
handle him for some change and
then say thank-you, is just to mea,
its a human drop.
