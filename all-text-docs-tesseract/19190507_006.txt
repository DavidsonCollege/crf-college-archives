bate was held in the Eumeanean Society
hall Wednesday night. ‘This debate de-
cides the possession of the Alumni De-
bating Cup, which poes to the society
winning the decision in this debate.

The subject of the debate was: Re-
solved, ‘That the R. O. ‘T. C. units
dhould be perinanently continued — by
the United States. “Phe Philanthropic
Society, represented by Messrs. Spence,
Chalmers and C. B. Alexander, upheld
the affirmative. Vhe Eumeanean So-
ciety, represented by Messrs. McGirt,
Woods and Liston, upheld the nega-
tive. The judges were Drs. Sentelle
and) McConnell, and Profs. Reed,

rendered in favor of the affirmative.

Mr. Chalmers for the Philanthropic
and Mr. Woods for the Huameanean
Society were chosen as presenting the
best debate for their respective sides,
and will receive medals at- gommence-
ment.

The speakers all gave evidence of
careful preparation and delivered their
speeches with unusual expressiveness.
The speakers were interested in the de-
bate and so made it spirited and enter-
taining.

An unusually large number of stu-
dents were at the “Y" vesper service
last Sunday evening to hear Professor
Garnand.
at few songs and a well-played violin
solo by C. E. Cunningham. ‘The sub-
ject chosen by Professor Qarnand was:
“The Idea of Christian ducation,”
and he gave the audience some new
thoughts on this interesting subject.

We are face to face, said Dr. Gar-
nand, with a great problem. We have
at last succeeded in making the world
safe for democracy. But we have
awakened to find that democracy is not
always safe for the world. Russia and
Mexico are two dangerous tilustrations
of this. In) Mexico, for instance, su-
perstition, religion, and ignorance are
the cause of her unsettled condition, If
Mexico had a Christian education, she
would not have descended into the pres-
ent state of corruption and disintegra-
tion. A democracy requires a higher
order of intelligence than a monarchy.

The Christian Church has an oppor-
tunity of doing what our government
cannot do by educating the Mexicans.
The conditions are largely the same in
Russia. Uf the people themselves are
not all right, a democracy cannot. suc-
ceed.

We won the war by force of men
and cannon, But a people’s morals can-
not be changed in that manner. This
is the Church's opportunity. And the
Christ realizes that for such problems
Christ is the only solution, Treaties or
leagues of nations are of no avail, nor
are prohibition, equal suffrage, and
many other suggested reforms. ‘This is
the cause for the billion dollar cam-
paign that the Protestant church in the
United States is going to launch and
finish before the end of this year. In-
creased missionary forces, new schools,
and advancement of Christianity over
the whole world will result from the
campaign. But this cannot be done
without men. And it is the purpose of
the Christian College to fit men for this
manner of work by imbuing in them
the high principles and noble character-
istics of a Christian education.

QUIPS AND CRANKS TO BE

HUGE SUCCESS.

Witl Not Be Delivered Until Summer.

The 1919 volume of Quips and
Cranks promises to be one of the best
that has ever been published for the in-
stitution. Although the management
has been pushed for time in getting the
book out this spring, due to late deliv-
ery of cuts, the book will be delivered
not later than the first of July.

The book will be entirely different
from its kind that has been published at
Davidson in a long time.

All students who will not be .at their
homes during the summer will please
write to S. M. Gilbert, Montreat, N.
C., giving him your present address so
that you will not be delayed in getting
your book.

SIGMA UPSILON DISCUESSES
O. HENRY'S WORKS

The Sigma Upsilon Society met last
Wednesday night. ‘The subject for dis-
cussion was the works of O. Henry—
William Sidney Porter as he is known
outside of the literary world. The dis-
cussion was informal ahd every one
took part in it. Some of his works had
been read by the members and were re-
ported on, while different phases of his
life were discussed also. Sandwiches
and punch were served and the meeting
adjourned.

This was the last meeting of the
Sigma Upsilon during this year, Each
member is to do as much reading this
summer as possible and next fall they
are to tell what author they found most
interesting and why..

As a result of the argument that red
butter comes from a red cow, “Babe”
Sherrill ‘was wet in’ front of Rumple
Thursday evening. Upon retreating to
his room he found himself seated in a
pond of water in his bed. Sherrill’s an-
ger was kindled and he wanted to
know who had committed this crime.
It was here that “Red” Smith appeared
upon the scene, and said: “I did it and
am proud of it.” As a result of chang-
ing clothes in the middle of the week
“Babe” is suffering from a severe cold.

Since there was no “fire” at 7:11 last
Monday night, there was no need for
the “fire” department.

“D” Club to
Get Busy Soon

A Large Number of Men Soon to Re-
ceive their “Baptism.”

With baseball season completed, the
“D” Club will increase its membership
considerably. Besides the _ baseball
men, there are the tennis, track and
back letters to be awarded. Following
are the new men winning their “D” in
baseball. “Cop” Johnson, Harry Sam-
ple, “Dug” McArn, “Joe” Miller, J.
D. Watt, basketball manager, and
Frank Hall, tennis champ, will also be
taken in. ‘Ihe track men to be ini-
tiated will probably be Craig, Finley,
Brice, Sprunt and McLeod.

Prospects for good teams next year
are good. Only a few men will be lost
from the “D” Club by graduation and
Davidson should turn cut some fast
teams. In football, Spann, McAlister,
Massie, Douglass, Fishel, McMaster,
and Brady will be back. Jonny Johnson
will probably return. ‘The loss of Rob-
son at guard will be felt, as this place
will be hard to fill, if it is to be held
down like it was this year.

Baskgtball suffers the worst. losses.
Only three men are certain to return.
‘These are “Prep" Hall, Chalmers, and
Schenck. Harrington is undecided but
hopes to return. Davenport, the only
man on this year's quint who was shoot-,
ing accurate, will graduate. McAskill,
our center and captain, will also grad-
uate and incidentally leave a big gap at
that position. ‘The loss of these two
men will cause a breach, which will be
hard to fill.

‘The baseball team will lose three
men, but among these is found the
mainstay of this year’s team. Miller,
Boswell and Clark graduate. “The loss
of “Railroad” Clark is regretted deeply
because he has been the one conspicuous
figure on this year’s nine. Holding up
the heavy end of the pitching — staff,
Clarke has done A-t work in all games.

The following men will return:
‘Johnson, Currie, Miley, Sample, Me-
Arn, Ratchford, Cassell, Richards and
Spann.

In track, Craig, our crack distance
runner, will be lost. Those returning
will be Murray, McQueen, — Finley,
Brice, Sprunt. and = McLeod. Frank
Hall, tennis champ, will be back.

All right. fellows, let's give fifteen
for the fellows that upheld the pride of
Davidson, and wish them success as
they step out into their life's work,
Think, eat, and sleep on Davidson dur-
ing the summer—and talk it up. In
September, coime back .ready to fight
for the teams of Greater Davidson.

BOYS! Now that hot
weather is here, keep
cool by wearing Szoors-
Schaefer Kool Kloths
made especially foryou,
from the very latest
patterns.

We guarantee satisfaction on
every deal.
