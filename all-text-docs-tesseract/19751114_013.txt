despite lost diving

The eleven-member David-
son College swimming team is
now going through pre-season
practice under coach Pat
Drake. Drake expects this
season to be a successful one,
and looks forward to improved
times and an improvement on
last year’s 3-9 record.

“‘There’s one _ holdup,
though,’’ she said. ‘‘Our
diving facilities have been
taken away, which means we
forfeit sixteen points a meet
under NCAA scoring.”

She has written the teams
against which the Cats will be
competing, requesting they
compete with Davidson on a
swimming basis only.

ever,’ she said. ‘“‘If they don’t
want to just swim us, we can’t
do anything about it.’’

This year’s team has lost
distance record-holder John
Scholler to graduation, but
Drake expects freshman Tim
Bodie to equal Scholler’s times
and sophomore Mike Knowles
to add distance depth.

In the sprints, junior John
MacArthur and freshman
John Fredrick should be a
successful pair, backed by
sophomore Tom Horn. Mac-
Arthur will also help out in the
backstroke, complementing
Skip Bradley, a freshman who
will swim the individual med-
ley as well.

John Washburn to do well in

JV team in limbo,
lack of interest cited

By DAVE WILEY

Davidson College may not
have a junior varsity basket-
ball program this year.

“No firm decision has been
made,” said head basketball
coach Bo Brickels. ‘‘But the
way things look now. I would
guess there will be.no JV.”

A final decision must be made
shortly, so that the opposing
teams can be notified in the
event the program is dropped,

according to Brickels.

The decision will be made
jointly by Athletic Director
Thomas Cartmill, Assistant
Athletic Director Tom Couch,
and Brickels; with final ap-

break both his breast stroke
records. Freshman breast
stroker Ken Noorwood shows
potential while sophomore
Marshall Brown and junior
Ron Owens sould be point-
getters in the butterfly.

Drake expects a ‘‘good,
exciting season.’’ Discounting
the automatic sixteen-point
deficit, Davidson swimmers
may be able to win six of their
twelve meets. Teams which
the Cats will compete well
against include Emory, The
Citadel, Pfeiffer, UNC. Ashe-
ville, Augusta College, and
possibly Appalacian.

“I’d like to make our sche-
dule realistic,’’ said Drake,
“and I think I’m getting
there.”

Brickels cited three primary
reasons for doing away with
the team: lack of interest, a
mediocre schedule, and little
benefit for the varsity prog-
ram.

“There was very little initial
interest,” said Brickels. ‘‘It
may have been our fault for
not advertising well enough,
but we had only eight or nine
players out the first week. If
twenty guys had shown up,
the question would have never
come up.”

The athletic department had
decided to drop the program
when a group of eleven inter-
ested students asked them to
reconsider their decision.

“Right now we are in a state
of limbo,’’ Brickels coment-
ed. ‘“‘One possible reason for
the lack of interest is the
absence of ‘name’ schools on
the schedule.”’ ;

‘‘The ‘JV schedule is not
very good,”’ said Brickels,
‘because no one in the South-
ern Conference has a junior
varsity program this year. In
previous years we could count
on at least Furman and East
Carolina having teams.”

Others schools which usual-
ly play Davidson but have
likewise dropped their JV
programs include Wake For-
est, Duke, UNC-C.

“That leaves North Carolina

as the only big school on our
schedule,” said Brickels. ‘“‘We
have had to resort to sched-
uling home-and-home contests
with junior colleges, when,
before, we never had to bother
with travelling to them.’’

Brickels sees IMAC as a
competitor of the junior var-
sity.

“With intramurals becom-
ing so competitive,’’ he noted,
‘‘a number of players who
would normally be on the JV
are choosing to play in IMAC
instead.”’

Brickels is undecided about
the junior varsity program.
He would not mind fielding a
team, but forsees little benefit
for the varsity.

“Obviously I would like to
have the program or else the
games never would have been
scheduled,”’ he added. ‘Other
factors entering into the de-
cision are expense and gym
time. We will save money
without having the team,”’
noted Brickels. ‘‘But that is
not very important.”’

“However, since we have to
share the gym with the girls’
team and the student body, I
am not sure if it is right to ask
for one or two more hours of
floor time a couple of days
each week.”’

‘“‘My main problem,’’ he
added, ‘‘is that I do not know
how the students feel.”’
