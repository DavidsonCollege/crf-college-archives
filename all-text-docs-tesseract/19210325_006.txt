DAVIDSON SUFFERS LOSS
IN DEATH OF MAJOR
HARPER.

Graduating in Class of '59, He
Rendered His State Marked
Service as Soldier and
Citizen.

In the death of Major Harper at
his home in Lenoir Wednesday,
March 16th, Davidson lost one of
her oldest alumni and staunchest
friends, and the state of North
Carolina one of her most valued
Only a few days ago the
writer was a guest in his home,
where all members of the house-
hold showed the respect def-
erence, and affection due to a man
of the Major’s age, character, and
position. He exhibited many
things of interest about his home
and in the bank that he founded
23 years ago and of which he was
still president. Among other
things of interest he showed me a
portrait of his father who came
down from the Scotch-Irish of
Pennsylvania in the early days to
find health in the pure air of West-
ern North Carolina, At the Pres-
byterian Church on the previous

esteemed elder, was in his ac-
customed place, interested in all
things pertaining to the Church.

citizens.

Major Harper was born in Cald-
well county in 1834 and entered
Davidson College in September,
1855, as a member of the class of
's9, though not remaining to grad-
uate. This was just a few years
after the two halls of the literary
societies had been erected, and be-
fore the foundations of Chambers
was laid. In this class were men
who later attained to great dis-
tinction in the life of the State and
Church. Among these were judges
J. D. McIver, Armistead Burwell
and R. T. Bennett, of the Superior
Court of North Carolina, the last
serving also in Congress for a
number of years; Hon L. L, Polk,
founder of the department of

of our present state treasurer;

Rev. Dr. J.. M. P. Otts, scholar, *

author, and founder of the “Otts
Lectureship” at Davidson. As we

read this list of names, along with .

many others of note appearing in
a single class, we are restrained to
remark that “giants dwelt in the
land” in those days.

The most of Major Harper's

Confederate Army, some attaining
to distinction, while a goodly num-
ber fell in battle or died in service.
As we study history of men who
attended Davidson in ante-bellum
days, and note the large propor-
tion of those surviving the Civil
War, who attained to eminence in
various walks of life, we are re-
minded afresh of the irreparable
loss sustained by our South Land
to the god of war.

Major Harper enlisted in 1862 in
Co. H, 58th N. C. Infantry, and rose
steadily to the rank of Major. This
regiment saw service at Chick-
amaugua and on many other bat-
tlefields of Tennessee and Georgia,
and the Carolinas until it surrend-
ered in Guilford county in April,
‘65, as a part of Gen. J. E. John-
ston’s army. Major -Harper was
wounded at Resaca, Ga. In the
State Hall of History in Raleigh
are found various articles used by
members of this regiment during
the war,—all the gifts of Major
Harper.

After the war Major Harper re-
turned to Caldwell county, where

early years of Davidson's life—

THE DAVIDSONIAN,

HERE AND THERE

from that time onward he was
identified with the business,
church, and social life of the town
and county. He played a promi-
nent part in the construction of

the C. & N. W. R. R.,, to which the
town and county so largely owe
their development. For years
Major Harper was a Trustee of
Davidson College and of Concord
Presbytery, and for many years he
was a general contributor to the
support of the work of both. His
son, G. F. Harper, of the class of
‘86, a few years ago succeeded the
Major as a trustee of Davidson;
while his grandson, Capt. James
Harper of the class of '15, of The
Wachovia Bank and Trust Co.,,
Winston-Salem, is one of the most
loyal and enthusiastic of David-
son’s younger alumni. Thus it is
that the expansion of Davidson in
recent years, its increasing mate-
rial equipment, its growing body
of students, its loyal young- alumni,
are traced back in many cases
more than one generation to stu-
dents like Major Harper, with
memories clustering around the
