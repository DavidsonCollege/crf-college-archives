Novice reporters ~

tell IMAC history

By THE KNAVES

Egad friends! The KA’s are
holding two-a-day tryouts, the
SPE’s have traded their fris-
bees in on a new pigskin, the
SAE’s are busy dumping the
sand out of their sneakers, and
the freshpersons are bumbling
in front of Chambers.

These phenomena can only
mean that forthwith, flying,
flagrant fumbles will fill fields
with forlorn frosh. Flickerball
is upon us.

Fron-Fron once told us that
history is nothing but the
reading and re-reading of old
IMAC score cards. Thus, with
the kind permission of com-
missioner Jeff Brown, who is
vainly attempting to replace
the irreplaceable Bowie Kuhn,
we spent the past week re-
searching in the IMAC arch-
ives.

What did we discover?
There are no archives. Alas,
left to our own devices, -we
pooled our vast intellectual
resources, and came up with
the history of Flickerball.

Time and space do not
permit a complete coverage of
the subject.

Therefore, this week we will
concentrate on some of the
more illustrious figures that
once won acclaim on the
intramural fields.

One of the most forgetable
games ever played at David-
son pitted an administration
team led by Registrar Richard

Burts aginst a hapless team of —

real zeroes.

The outcome of the game
was always in doubt. Neither
team played above its capabil-
ities. However, in the closing
seconds, Dick Burts broke
into the open on a long flick, a
desperation flick came his
way, and unfortunately for the
administration, the ball slip-
ped through his hands.

His only excuse to his
disappointed teammates. “I’m
sorry but my hands were
tied.”’

Professors have not always
been paid well here at David-
son. It has only been in recent
years that the need for a
professor to hold down a
second job has diminished.

One of the most popular of
the moonlighting jobs was to
referee IMAC flickerball game
at two bucks a game. Profes-
sor of Philosophy George Ab-

this garbage) revolutionized

ernathy was one of the
school’s most respected ref-
erees.

Like every other referee he
was never able to complete a
game without meeting some
trouble from the more obnox-
ious gross teams on campus,

It is remembered that in one
game, there was heated ar-
gument over a touchdown call.
The players demanded Aber-
nathy to tell them whether it
was a touchdown or not, his
classic reply was, ‘‘What is is;
what is not is not.”

One of the greatest split
ends in the history of David-
son football was the elusive
and deceptive Carroll Ensley
whose pass patterns consist-
ently left the field strewn with
athletic supporters.

Ensley, who was editor of
the Quips and Cranks when
not practicing his flicks, had a
natural ability to get lost in a
crowd. Tragically Ensley’s
career ended on a down-and-
out pattern into the woods of
field five and across the state
line,

The first recorded injury in
flickerball history occurred in
the late 1920’s. Chalmers Dav-
idson (voted the tailback of
the century by the writers of

DAVIDSON RUGGERS practice for

of the ball) in IMAC flickerball play.

the game with his legendary
“Southern weave’’.

This maneuver involved

running backwards at full
speed which both concealed
the ball from the defense and
allowed the tailback the option
of a quick pitch to,a trailing
halfback.

On the day of the 1927
Championship game Chalmers

well-endowed mint juleps and
47 deep knee bends. Eye-
witnesses still claim that they
had never seen the weave
executed more perfectly —even
between plays Chalmers had
the weave at work.

However, late in the game
on a crucial fourth down play
Chalmers ran his ‘Southern
weave” into a stand of South-
ern pines: A plaque was later
placed on the first tree Chal-
mers hit and even now in the
drier months you can see the
indentation made by Chal-
mers’ head.

In the true American trad-
ition flickerball has been
wracked by its share of scan-
dals. An over zealous fresh-
men in 1939 by the name of
Slammin’ Sam Spencer got
hold of a play book from
Williams College and tried to

use it in the playoffs.

If it’s good enough for
Williams, by golly, it’s good
enough for Davidson—right
Slammer?

Only two years ago IMAC
sports was rocked to its foun-
dations by a sex scandal when
a squad called The Sty tried to
pass themselves off as a girls’
flickerball team. No doubt
about it, some teams will go to
any lengths to win.

Flickerball history may
even be made this year and if
so, these intrepid reporters
will be there to cover it.
Perhaps the Zeroes will win a
game. Maybe the Delts will
stay straight for both halves
of the game.

Who knows, this column
might even be semi-humorous
for a change. Only time will
tell.
