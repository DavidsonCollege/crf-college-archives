Gull's Nest...

There is More That Unites Us Than Divides Us

However you may view the
legacy of Richard Nixon, he did
come up with a memorable phrase
at the height of the Vietnam War.
Nixon referred to the “silent ma-
jority” of Americans who worked
hard, paid their taxes, loved their
country, tried to save for their chil-
dren, and needed a great deal of
provocation to speak up.

I think that perhaps we have a
silent majority at Davidson. I wrote
recently that Davidson is a more
“moderate” than a truly “conser-
vative” institution, but this is not a
matter of politics. Most students
here are working so hard that it
takes a real effort to attend meet-
ings, put together « petitions, or
frame a thoughtful letter to this
newspaper. Asa freshman used to
the class meetings of high school,
Ibelieve assembling our entireclass
from time to time and encouraging
everyone to express their opinions
would prove popular and benefi-
cial, but it has yet to be tried.

It’s great that The Davidsonian
is as much a journal of opinion as

a chronicle of events. However,
The Davidsonian is not synony-
mous with Davidson. Anyone
reading this newspaper through-

Bill Gullan

out the past year would conclude
that the overriding issue on cam-
pus is “diversity,” and that student

“apathy” is a major problem.

The fact is that, whatever our
time constraints, we are anything
but apathetic about what concerns
us most directly. I believe that we
are dedicated to this school, its
traditions, and its future. How else
to explain why so many people
applied to be Hall Counselors and
Tour Guides? It wasn’t apathy
that induced the students to paint
cat paws all over town during the
soccer season, or for so many ser-

vice projects to find sponsorship |

here.

As for diversity, I think that
what most Davidson students care
aboutis simply tohave good people
come here. Weare not concerned
with percentages, gender or
ethnicity. There is no need to
“update” our Statement of Pur-
pose. Yes, Davidson has a Chris-
tian character. Georgetown may
be run by the Jesuits, but non-
Catholics and non-Christians feel
just as comfortable there. You
don’t have to be Jewish to go to
Brandeis, or black to goto Howard.

Ofcoursediversity, including ideo-
logical diversity, is healthy, but

‘everyone should be judged by a

single standard. Are there too many
Southerners at Davidson? Too
many Presbyterians? The
Davidson tradition is what unites
us, honor is its touchstone, and that
does notever gooutof style. There
can never be toomany good people.

The late writer Theodore
White once noted that when he
was a student there were really two
Harvards—that of the “grinds” like
himself and that of the “snobs,”
with little communication between
them. There is only one Davidson.
Sharing the same ideals is much
more important than having iden-
tical ideas. The laid back Davidson
of Thursday nights at Back Street
is not antithetical to the intensive
Davidson of sustained’ Sunday
studying.

At the same time, workload
does notdefine an outstanding aca-
demic institution. Time for reflec-
tion is just as important. Davidson
already boasts the primary requi-

site of high-quality education: an
accessible and dedicated faculty.
How much we manage to get outof
this environment is up to each of
us, but the opportunities are there
for all.

Despite the clustering ordeal,
there are still freshmen I haven’t
met (whoI’m sure want to hear my
opinions at closer range). Sinceall
friendships are based on shared

experiences, I will make friends”

with those who share my inter-
ests—even if I haven’t met them
yet. It all happens naturally.
Most importantly, I hope that
next year more students will take
the opportunity to speak out. If
Trustees can find the time to come
to campus, it is our obligation to
give them an authentic impression
of how it really is here. Like in the

clustering episode, student opin-
ion can affect change, or even re-

sistit. Open your mouthand watch
what happens. As Davidson stu-
dents, there is alot more that unites
us than divides us. I think we can
all agree on that.

F.L.A.G. Panel Deserves Credit

By Will Lazenby

Before spring break some stu-
dents did acourageous thing. Those
students formed: a panel center
stage in a packed 900 Room and
recounted their experiences as ho-
mosexuals. And they were warmly
received.

As a member of the audience,
I was at once impressed and upset.
I was amazed at the fortitude of the
speakers, but I was saddened thatit
required a public gathering for our
students to admit something that
they had to keep hidden so long.

Last year there were a lot of
problems on campus concerning
the harassment of homosexuals.

In fact, oné‘of the panel members”

in the 900 Room was a former
Davidson student who transferred
because he was treated so horribly.
He even received death threats.

Each panel member gave an
account of what life was like grow-
ing upa homosexual. And mostof
them said the same thing, that ho-
mosexuality was not a choice.
Some of the members even forced
themselves to date people of the
opposite sex to rid themselves of
homosexuality.

The forced dating didn’t work.
Nothing did. Those members of
the panel that tried to fight their

feelings eventually gave in to what
couldn’t be fought. What mem-
bers did was finally give in to be-
ing themselves. :

Because of the
mindedness of some people, the
panel members understood what
they were feeling to be wrong.
They were taught that homosexu-
ality was bad, and that homosexu-
als-were outcasts tobe shunned.
Just now are those students on the
panel able tocome out and say who
and what they are.

Ithink each of us would like to
change at least one thing about
ourselves. If you’re like me, you’d
like to fix alot more than one thing.
But we’re stuck with us. That’s
something I re-learn everyday.

closé-—

Like it or not, I’m just me. Some
days that’s a tough lesson to re-
learn. But I don’t get out of bed to
face scom and ridicule, as many
homosexuals do. And they
shouldn’t have to either.

It’s not right: to persecute
someone for whoheis. If someone
is wrong about something, argue.
If a person does something bad to

you, let them know. But don’t
blame a person for being him or
herself, especially if that person
has already tried to change. In-
Stead, try to open up, even to put
yourself in his shoes. You might
sympathize, and you might find
that who that person is isn’t so bad
at all.

Malcolm X's Message Often Misunderstood

We'd like to salute those

people who held a panel in the 900
Room a few weeks ago to discuss
their lives as homosexuals. We’d
especially like to salute Meg Jones,
who took a potentially larger risk
than others since she’s still a stu-
denthere. We were alsovery happy
with the level of support the speak-
ers received from the audience.
Davidson really impresses us
sometimes.: —
_ _ By presenting both the bad
and good aspects of his philoso-
phy, we hope to eliminate some of
the misunderstanding surrounding
this controversial but brilliant and
influential character. What fol-
lows was written by Scott.

Contrary to popular belief

“about Malcolm X, his final ideol-

ogy promoted acceptance of all
types of people, regardless of race.
Most people are familiar with him
only through the first, most out-
spoken years of his career as.a

spokesman for the Nation of Is-
lam.

This organization, which is
still strong today, insisted upon the
superiority of the black race, the
inherent evil of the white race, and
the need for black people to with-

* draw, socially and economically,

from white-dominated society.
Malcolm X was saved from a mis-
erable existence on the streets and
in jail by members of the Nation,
and later helped build itinto alarge
and successful enterprise:
* He rose to power within the
Nation, but was ejected shortly
before his holy pilgrimage to
Mecca. The trip to Mecca com-
pletely changed Malcolm’s views
of white people, and he returned to
the United States determined to
preach his new gospel. Assassins’
bullets cut him down in 1965 be-
fore he had a chance to make any
progress.

Many people misunderstand

Malcolm X’s message. This is
largely because his philosophy was
being constantly developed and
revised to fit his growing experi-
ences. There are two main parts to

Malcolm’s philosophy. The part:

he developed early in his career is,
in many ways, contradictory to the
part he developed late in his career.

Early in his career, at the time
when Malcolm was very active in
the Nation of Islam, his most vola-
tile anti-white statements were
being recorded and reported by the
(white-dominated) press.

His message risked alienating

whites, especially those who were .

alive then, who understandably see
Malcolm X’s philosophy as threat-
ening, dangerous, and even revo-
lutionary. His message also risks
misleading younger people, blacks
and whites alike, who know
Malcolm X only through pop cul-
ture—ads for the movie, hats, t-
shirts, and a few powerful quota-

tions taken from these more ag-
gressive days.

This pop culture cannot possi-
bly present Malcolm X in a com-
plete and fair view; it aims only to
make him a fad. Most of his early
thought is, indeed, somewhat dan-
gerous. His late career, however,
saw the development of a univer-
sal philosophy of harmony and
acceptance.

His trip to Mecca, where he
saw Muslims of all races acting
like brothers, radically altered his
opinion of white people. Sadly, it
is his lastand most important mes-
sage that is the least-known and
most frequently neglected.
Malcolm X’s autobiography, col-
lected by Alex Haley, gives a very
good insight into his real inten-
tions, and gives the whole story of

-his life, from his days of poverty in

Michigan to his trip to Mecca. Itis

this book which is the basis for our _

presentation of Malcolm X.
