Rush Week Confirmation Should
Be Out Of Fraternities’ Hand

It is apparent that some changes
must be made in the present system
of confirming dates for Rush Week
parties.

The confusion and alleged irregu-
larities that went on during the Mon-
day afternoon confirmation period
make clear the necessity for a revised
system. What is needed is a plan that
will take the whole matter out of the
hands of the fraternity men and put
the sole decisions in the hands of the
freshmen and the LF.C.

Take Away Pressure

The new system mist take away
from the fraternity men the oppor-
tunity to pressure the prospective
rushees into giving a particular fra-
ternity dates in general. or certain
dates in particular.

At present the Interfraternity
Council is working on such a plan.
A committee was appointed before
Rush Week began. This committee,
headed by Charles Stowe. is to evalu-
ate Rush Week and to make recom-
mendations for improvements.

It has been suggested by some
that we abolish the present method
of having fraternity men rush into
the dorms on Monday afternoon to
confirm the dates and then to hurry
over to the master charts to make
permanent these dates.

Suggested Plan

Instead. it is suggested that the
IFC handle the matter itself. Such a
plan might work as thus:

1. The IFC give to every fresh-
man a regular sheet of paper. On
this paper, the freshman would write-
out the schedule they wanted for
the first three nights of Rush Week.
Their choices of fraternities. of
course, would depend upon the date
cards they had received prior to con-
firmation.

This schedule would be handed to

the IFC and would serve as a master
chart for the IFC.

2. In addition, each fraternity
would be assigned a box. At a pre-
scribed time, every freshman would
drop into the various boxes date
cards telling that particular fraternity
when they have dates with the rushee.

Advantages

Such .a system seems to have
many advantages. First it would elim-
inate any pressures to visit a par-
ticular fraternity..

Secondly, it could be executed
within thirty minutes.

Thirdly. it would rule out the con-
flicts and hard feelings between the
different fraternities.

This same procedure may be used
for the return dates on Thursday
and Friday nights.

Some changes must be made in
the present system. This plan seems
to eliminate the difficulties of the
present one.

Phone Needs

Regulation

The direct telephone exchange to
Charlotte is one of the best services
to come our way in a long time.

The problems of waiting in line
to use the phone. however, take away
much of the pleasure and conven-
ience of the new service.

Could. not some system be worked
out whereby students would not have
to crowd around the steps and the
TV room waiting for the phone?

Perhaps the student on duty at
the Union desk could be in charge
of regulating the use of the phone.
It would be a.lot more convenient for
everyone if some system could be de-
vised so that a student could make
constructive use of his time while
waiting for the telephone.

One such suggestion would be the
numbers method... The man on duty
at the Union could give each student
a number, and at the end of every
five minutes he. would call out the
next number which had the right to
use the phone.

At least this method would give
students some idea of how long they
must wait.

The College Union has gotten a lot
more business .because of the tele-
phone exchange. They would be do--
ing the student body a needed service
if they helped to regulate its use.

Another
Milestone

Tuesday night’s drawing for loca-
tions on the new fraternity court
marked another milestone in the his-
tory of Davidson's fraternity system.

It is perhaps too early to predict
what ultimate effect the new houses
will have on the administration’s and

students’ philospohy toward fraterni-
ties.

Maybe the new court will bring
with it different ideas about certain
social restrictions now on the books.
Probably any significant modifica-
tions, however, will be long in com-
ing.

Neverless, it is certain that the
new court will make more sure the
fraternity system on this campus.

Last spring the DAVIDSONIAN
said that the administration’s back-
ing of the court meant ‘100% en-
dorsement of the fraternity system.”
Certainly Tuesday night's drawing,
led by Mr. D. Grier Martin and Dr.
William G. McGavock, is further evi-
dence that fraternities are a perma-
nent institution within the college sys-
tem.

Davidson is blessed with many de-
sirable features. One of these is a
stable group of good fraternities. In
this present era when the entire fra-
ternity. system is under attack by
those who would seek to destroy it,
we can be thankful that the faculty
and .administration of Davidson Col-
lege have reasserted their support.

Neophytes

Rumblings of discontent have
been heard from both sides concern-
ing the Monday morning meetings
Freshmen are required to attend with
their faculty advisor.

Perhaps it might be well to review
the purposes of these faculty-fresh-
men sessions that were instituted a
few years ago.

First, there should be a discus-
sion of the academic requirements of
the College. Secondly, any errors in
registration should be corrected. And
finally, and: most important, here is
an opportunity for the newcomers to
ask the questions that they would
hesitate to ask before the entire
Freshman Class, or the whole student
body.

COMMITTEE MEETS THIS WEEK

Curriculum Revisions Called Key To Future

By LAURENS WALKER

The Faculty Curriculum Com-
mittee met last night to begin
the long and no doubt painful
task of hammering out a mod-
ern curriculum for Davidson.
It's difficult to say what will
be accomplished this year, or
even next, for some one once
said that changing a_ college
curriculum was as hard to do
as moving a grave. yard. One
thing is certain. If Davidson
is to remain a leader in the
field of liberal arts education,
some revisions must be made.

Modern ccducational thought
proposes that the real need of
the college student is an op-
portunity to gain a broad base
of understanding and general
knowledge while in college.
Technical training can come

later, but the chance to gain
understanding and a view of
the “big picture” may never
come after college years.

SCATTERED AND DIVIDED

Does Davidson‘ now offer this
opportunity? I think not. The
largest part of the curriculum
seems to be an opportunity to
gain miscellaneous information.
scattered and divided data, and
specialized skills. The ideal of
unified insight finds no haven
among the quadratic equations,
verb declensions, physics for-
mulas and the like which contin-
ually beset us. What we need
are not courses which teach
one to be a_ physicist, but
courses that give one an un-
derstanding of its basic theor-
ies and its importance in the

LETTERS TO EDITOR

“Rights” Stand Attacked

Dear Editor:

Once. again the cry of ‘States
Rights” was sounded in last
week's DAVIDSONIAN. And
President Eisenhower was
viciously attacked for using
Federal troops to restore peace
in Little Rock. Certainly, it is
the privilege of every Ameri-
can citizen to voice such criti-
cism, but let us examine just
what States’ Rights were vio-
lated, and who violated them.

FLOUTED DUTY

As the editar pointed out, it
is the States’ right and duty to
preserve and enforce peace in
the State. However, an objective
study of the Little Rock situa-
tion reveals. that this impor-
tant function of the State was
intentionally and = inexcusably
flouted by the ‘one man who
is directly responsible for the
maintenance of peace in the
State—Governor Faubus. . . .

By calling out the National
Guard, Governor Faubus not
only profaned the daty entrust-
ed to him by the citizens of
Arkansas, but actually stimulat-
ed the mob violence and mass

hysteria that last week shocked
al! followers of American
Democracy.

NO ALTERNATIVE
I am the first to recognize
the tragedy of using the Unit-
ed States Army to enforce the
law of our country. But in
Little Rock there was no altern-
ative. The scathing racial hate
which had been incited into the
people by the wanton action
of Faubus and other white su-
premacists, had reached such
an extreme that no'longer was
it possible to preserve the
peace solely by focal and state

police... .
DON STEIN

Dear Editor:

I was very disappointed in
your editorial last week con-

cerning Eisenhower and_ the
Little Rock situation.
Mr. Eisenhower has _ not

“broken faith with the spirit
and meaning of the Constitu-
tion of the United States.” He
has not “denied the state of
Arkansas the right to handle
its own affairs” or “prevented

it from performing one of its
natural functions.”

UNREPEALED STATUTES

It .is true that Congress has
Tecently voted down -the civil
rights bill and repealed a law
permitting the President to use
federal forces in civil rights
cases. But according to Dean
F. D. G. Ribble of the Universi-
ty of Virginia Law School, a
noted authority on constitution-
al law, there are statutes in the
U. S. Code which have not
been repealed and which pro-
vide that “when the President
considers that unlawful  ob-
struction or assemblages make
it impracticable to enforce the
laws of the United States by
ordinary course of judicial pro-
ceedings, he may call into the
federal service such of the mili-
tia and use such of the armed
forces as he thinks necessary."

When the President saw that
the forces of the state of Arkan-
sas were not adequately hand-
ling the situation, he legally
and justly invoked federal
power to uphold federal law.

Fraternity Court Problems

By JOHN TOUMARAS

The opening of the Patterson
Fraternity Court next fall pre-
sents the solutions to the prob-
lems of crowded fraternity
houses and, in many instances,
overcrowded, delapidated, and
outmoded boarding houses. The
move to construct the new
houses was undoubtedly the
right one under the circum.
stances, but the wisdom of tak-
ing such a step without first
considering the problems en-
gendered by the new houses is
to be questioned. The court is,
in a sense, a reality, but the
problems are far from being
definitely resolved.

RENT INEQUALITY

One problem produced by the
court is that of rent. The in-
equality in numbers of men in
each fraternity makes the pay-
ment of rent by each fraternity

completely ridiculous. Fraterni-
ties with sixty to seventy or
more members would probably
encounter no difficulty in mak-
ing its payments, but consider
the pljght of the smaller fra-
ternities. A higher rent would
mean higher dues; higher dues
quite possibly would mean less
pledges; and soon the fraterni-
ties would begin to die.

A system whereby each mem-
ber of the fraternities would
pay an equal share of the total
rent of the entire system as
a part of his general fees is,
perkaps, the best answer to the
problem which has been offered
to date. Recent remarks by Dr.
McGavock and Mr. Martin lead
this writer to believe that such
a solution will be adopted.

BOARD BILLS

The problem of board, how-
ever, still remains. The in-
equality of fraternity member-

ship would mean that the larg-
er fraternities would be able
to eat better and cheaper than
smaller fraternities. In order
for the smaller fraternities to
eat as well as the larger ones,
board bills would have to be
raised. And so once again less
pledges are obtained and the
fraternity dies.

It seems that both the prob-
lems of rent and board could
be easily resolved by the use of
a “preferential bidding system.”
This would not mean that the
fraternity system would have
to absorb those individuals that
it considered to be undesirable.
Rushing and bidding would be
in the accustomed manner. Each
fraternity, however, would be
limited to the number of
pledges that it could obtain. In
several years all fraternities
would have equal memberships
and therefore rent and board
per individual would be equal.

jectively looked into.

A general science course
would be of value with physics,
chemistry, biology, and astron-:
omy considered for equal per-
iods of time. Emphasis would
be placed on theory and un:
derstanding rather thant on
problem solving which is too
much the case now. It might
be necessary to rotate profes-
sors as the subject matter
changed, but this
worked out with little confus-
sion if welt planned.

The math = depariment has

made marked progress with its
11 courses. This type course
should be expanded and care-
fully studied to make certain
that all the possible benefits
are being gotten out of it.
The possibility of a semester

could be ,

of speech, the fine arts. crea-
tive writing, and others deserve
consideration. It is quite possi-
ble, now, for a man to graduate
from Davidson and not even
know who Bach was, much less
have an appreciation for his
music and the reasons for his
greatness. This situation should
be corrected.

SMOKE AND FIRE

This issue of curriculum
change will doubtless not bring
forth any great oratory or epic
literature, but it is certainly
the most important thing hap-
pening at Davidson this year.
An interested student body can
do much to insure that at least
a little fire will come out of
the smoke that is about to be
venerated.

Dear Boxholder

By PHIL LEWIS

Well, the honeymoon is about over, and a lot of
people are learning that attempting to fit the 25-hour
Davidson Standard Day into the normal one causes much

confusion.

Both on the college level and on the fraternity level,
the Freshman has discovered that far from being king,
he is now little better than an amoeba. Big Brother is

once again observing closely.

Standing Room Only

Lessons are causing serious interference in the most
important things around campus, but standing room only
crowds surround every TV set. After all the battle be-
tween the Yankees and the Braves is far more important
than that between Knowledge and Ignorance, at least for

the time being.

Bob Jones’ face really turned red Tuesday when he
drew his own fraternity first. Everyone seemed pretty
well satisfied with the locations, especially those in the

northwest corner.

Wee Hours

Speaking of fraternities, we heard that the Betas
had a large crowd of visitors in the wee hours of last Sat-
urday morning. We guess all the “Dear Boxholder” let-
ters had been sent, and they had nothing better to do.

We were talking to Tom Cutting, and he feels he is
recovering quite well indeed from the knee operation he
underwent last month. He also remarked that he heard
a campaign is underway to change the name of Chambers
Building. Seems like that’s the thing to do nowadays.

COFFEE BREAK

Rush Week:
An Evaluation

By JOHN BERNHARDT

Rush Week of 1957 is now
a thing of the past. It was -the
hardest fought and, in fact, the
dirtiest Rush Week most of
the upperclassmen can _ recall.
But should it be so strenuous?
Should such emphasis and ef-
fort be put into Rush Week?

Fraternity has been by far
the most important factor in
the lives of the Davidson stu-
dents this last week, but it is
not like that all the time. On-

ly during Rush Week do boys.

who normally are friends stop
speaking to each other, and
neighboring fraternities slash
at each other with genuine
hatred. Everyone puts studies
at the very last of the list of
“things that really ought to
gét done sometime-or-other”.

SUSPENSION OF VALUES

Conscientious boys who usual-
ly stay well within their moral
limits, under the strain of the
competitive mania support or
carry out policies they would
abhor at other times. Rules are
kept only by straining at  in-
terpretations, and then only be-
cause of fear of punishment.
In short, there is a brief. but
total, suspension of values.

Fraternities are the cause of
this, but we do not keep up
this emphasis throughout the
rest of the year; with a sigh
of relief we return to the cus-
tomary patterns, the normally
aceepted morals and friend-
ships. and the comparative de-
emphasis of fraternities. We
have given a false impression,
and the burden of it is begin-
ning to hit the pledges now.
They have been sold on the
line that Fraternity is every-
thing. and that their fraternity
would like very much to have
them as brothers.

ANTI-CLIMAX

Now, after Saturday's pledg-
ing, the climax of the entire
year for the fraternity bas been

foe
i°:

passed, and the brothers all
tend to drop the fraternity and
forget the pledges. If we seri-
ously thought the fraternity was
worth suspending all morals
and duties for, we should try
now more than ever to make
of the pledges and fraternity
something worth having.

Some hold that the fraterni-
ties on the Davidson campus
are nothing more than “eating
clubs”, where friends get to-
gether for meals. This may be
selling them short, but certain-
ly nobody could claim that here
they are party-giving social
clubs or civie-minded service
groups. Perhaps these might be
good approaches to try, at
least for the novelty. But no
matter how loose the fraternal
ties may be, the fraternities do
mold the boys in them just as
any consistent association may
do. This fact calls for an evalu-
ation of the fraternity. Does it
develop the full potentials of
its members?

FRESH MATERIAL

There is now fresh material.
Teady to form and be formed
by the group. Every rusher who
said his fraternity was the best
should look at it now, free from
Rush Week fever, to see if it
really is forming the boys in
the way that is best. They
Should be developing properly
in education, ability to lead and
to work, skill in athletics, so-
cial noise and manners, and
general outlook on life. If the
fraternity does not do this for
them, it has been false, to its
Tushees, and will disappoint
and fail with its pledges.

Last week we gave up all our
old values for the over-master-
ing love of the fraternity. The
LF.C. is readjusting the rules.
It. is up to us to evaluate our
thinking about Rush Week and
to readjust the fraternities
along whatever lines will truly
make them the best.
