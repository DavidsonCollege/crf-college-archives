dazzling display of intricate passes

It is entirely too early to predict

... for tobacco
cut right to smoke right

There’s a right way to carve a chicken or slice a ham.
And there’s a right way to cut tobacco.

When the tobacco in your cigarette is cut the way
it is in Chesterfield... right width and right length

... it burns even and smooth... it smokes better.
