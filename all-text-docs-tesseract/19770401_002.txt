WDAV Station Manager
Sid Barrett, recently elected
President of the -Publications
Board, plans to rejuvenate the
board, making it more effec-
tive in solving some of the
problems in the student med-
ia.
“We need a clearer vehicle
to express student thought,”
said Barrett.

The Publications Board is’

made up of College Business
Manager Robert Currie, the
general manager of WDAV,
and the editors of the Wildcat
Handbook, Quips and Cranks,
The Davidsonian, and The
Miscellany.

Barrett will call meetings of
the board more frequently,
and would like to tighten
communications between edi-
tors in order to better organize
student opinion.

“T’d like to see more oppor-
tunities for the student to
come talk to all the media
heads together.

“‘I would also like for the
students to share, if possible,
some of the benefits from the
high power radio station, es-
pecially the opportunities- in
radio journalism.”

The Publications Board is
not a decision-making author-
ity. It works in conjunction
with the newly-formed Media
Board.

The Publications Board is

not a decision-making author-
ity. It works in conjunction
with and makes recommenda-
tions to the newly-formed
Media Board.

The Media Board has a

broad range of powers over the
student media—among them,
appointing and dismissing ed-,
itors, reviewing financies and
budgets, and establishing a
code of responsible journal-
ism.

“The Media Board is made

up of people not directly
involved with student media,
which is probably a good
thing,” said Barrett.

“unresponsiveness of the ad-

Citing the proposed policy
of the Uniom in regard to
vandalism, and certain _poli-
cies of the Athletic Depart-
ment as examples, he stated
there seems to be ‘‘less and
less student input” in policy
making since he has been a
student.

He urged the Senate to
make the administration ac-
countable for its decisions.
