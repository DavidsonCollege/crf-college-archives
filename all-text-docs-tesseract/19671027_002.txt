It’s Us

ED. NOTE: The following Is a review
of The War Game, a movie which is to
be a featured part of the proposed Peace
Week. If was written by K. Jon Morris
of The Ouke Chronicle.

The War Game should be shown on
every television station and in every
theater from coast to coast. It should
be required viewing for every man or
woman in this country (or any other)
who advances even tne slightest justi-
fication for the pattern of modern de-
fense and modern warfare. More im-
portantly, it should be required view-
ing for each and every member of
what Norman Cousins has called “the
Shockproof Generation,” the genera-
tion which has decided to stop worry-
ing and accept The Bomb. ;

Thirty-one-year-old Peter Watkins
produced this 47-minute documentary
for BBC Television. Horrified by the
realistic portrayal of the effects of a
nuclear attack on Kent County in
England by Kent’s own citizens, the
BBC has banned The War Game from
British television and from sale to
other networks. presumably to prevent
mass panic, probably to prevent giving
life to what is now a dead political
issue. Herein lies the trust of Wat:
kins’ efforts: to portray in a personal
way the incredible physical and mental
destruction and pain that would result
from nuclear war, and to illustrate how
removed is the average citizen from
the power structure which controls
the use of atomic weapons, and indeed
how far removed is the very thought
of The Bomb’s existence from the
consciousness of the man in the street.

It is not a pretty or happy thing to
see: it is grotesque and _ ironic.
Projecting itself into the near future,
it postulates a world-wide crisis pre-
cipitated in Southeast Asia. The
Chinese invade South Vietnam; the
United States threatens nuclear re-
taliation; Russia announces that she
is preparing to occupy West Berlin:
Riots at Checkpoint Charlie provoke
the Russians to act, NATO comes to
the rescue, and, in the face of superior
conventional forces, it launches tactic-
al nuclear weapons. The war is on. At
no point is there a means within the
power structure to prevent the in-
evitable chain of events leading to
holocaust.

From this point, the attention is
centered on the personal effects of the
attack. As local emergency commis-
sions begin to implement what are obv-
fously inadequate evacuation and civil
defense programs, the problems of
coping with large numbers of evacuees
are overshadowed by real and poig-
nant questions: would women refuse
to leave their husbands and homes to
be evacuated to a strange and only
slightly safer refuge?

And then the bomb. A small boy
looks up at the sky and the fireball
from a single-megaton bomb landing
27 miles away burns out his retinas.
Buildings are reduced to rubble in a
matter of seconds. Human flesh burns
until charred black and split open.
Fireman trying to put out the blaze

are felled by carbon monoxide and
methane gas and consumed by the 100-
mile-an-hour winds and the 800 de-
gree Centigrade temperatures of a
“fire storm.”

The after-effects are just as grue-
some and more prolonged. One wit-
nesses the tortuous and lasting effects
of radiation: a child who has had half
of his red blood corpuscles destroyed
and who faces seven years as an in-
valid and then a slow death. Equally
telling are the effects on society. Peo
ple live in total dejection and inertia,
wallowing in their own filth. Morality
disintegrates. Even among the re-
spectable middle-class, there is wide-
spread disregard for law and order,
resulting in pilfering, theft. black.
market, and eventually murder. In
the face of mass malnutrition and scur-
vy. hunger riots against government
control are inevitable. Many survivors
will never overcome fear and shock
and will live in a state of permanent
neurosis.

Where does the responsibility lie?
Watkins lays it at the feet of every
uninformed and apathetic citizen who
allows his government to continue
playing nuclear games, who expects
his churches to continue rationalizing
his apathy, and who expects his infor-
mation media to continue shielding
him from the possible consequences
of staying on our present path.

The War Game defies accurate de-
scription. It is an experience that
transcends fear and shock. Those are
not Japanese or Germans on the
screen. It’s us.

Deaf Ears

Out of all of the verbiage that has
been printed editorially about the anti-
Vietnam war protest in Washington
last week, comes this little gem from
The Christian Science Monitor: ‘Pro-
testors cannot undertake to wreck
with their own hands laws which they
don't like. Legal ways and means
are available for changing policies.”

Since that comment appeared last
Saturday, the editorial writer did not
have the benefit of President John-
son's statement Monday night about
how responsive he is to legal ways
and means.

The communists, he said, ‘cling
stubbornly to the belief that their
aggression will be rewarded—by our
frustration, our impatience, ovr un-
willingness to stay the course.” (bold
addéd.) He continued, “It will not be
so.”

Tf all the protest did was cause the
President to say he is unwilling to
heed the popular calis for an end to
the war, then, sadly, we must conclude
that it was a failure. But, somehow,
we had the idea that in a democracy
the government was supposed to pay
attention when a growing percentage
of the populace called for it to change
its course. Or is that not a legal way
or means?

Stepping Down

Davidson's affiliation with the Pres-
byterian Church has been hit many
times by THE DAVIDSONIAN. Un-
fortunately, much of the criticism of
the relationship has been limited to
Selfish, although valid, complaints

about the position that the college

takes on campus drinking largely as a
result of the church connection.

Recently. however, the church has
given another reason for the college
to reconsider its affiliation. A little
less than two weeks ago the Mecklen-
burg Presbytery made one of those
hypocritical moves that have very
often been evidenced in church be-
havior. The presbytery decided to
worship and glorify God by refusing
to face up to the issue of open housing
in Charlotte.

An eloquent and perceptive evalua-
tion of this action was given in a letter
to The Charlotte Observer Tuesday.
Ear! W. Lawrimore, director of the
college news bureau, wrote, “Meck-
lenburg Presbytery did not just take
a step backward in tabling the ppen-
housing project; it took a step down-
ward. The men who voted to table that
proposal seemed to say to all the
world, both black and white, ‘We
care more about the value of our
property than we care about the value
of human dignity and freedom.’

“And yet they did not have the
actual courage to vote openly against
the provosal; they perferred to table
the motion, apparently fearing that
even discussing it would be too up-
setting, as if their discomfort would be
greater than that of the thousands of
trapped Negro ghetto-dwellers in
Charlotte, who often find their neigh-
borhood as great a stigma as the

color of their skin.”

If the reasoning behind the action
is the old argument that the church
should involve itself only in matters
of the spirit and not those of the flesh,
then the supporters of that argument
should not be surprised when poten-
tial church members decide that they
can be more meaningful Christians by
avoiding the church.

It is extremely doubtful that this
issue would cause the college to be
ashamed of its church affiliation, but
it does make us wonder. We can only
be thankful that someone was open-
minded enough to push for some ac-
tion on the problem in the first place.

New Math?

Visiting mathematicians have never
Stirred quite the campus excitement
that winning basketball teams create
—neither is attendance at their lec-
tures quite so impressive.

We nevertheless tip our hat this
week to Dr. Howard Eves, professor
of mathematics at the University of
Maine, and to the Piedmont Univer-
sity Center which brought him to the
campus.

Dr. Eves, the author of several text-
books and a history of mathematics,
lectured twice while here; and each
occasion proved stimulating to math
major and layman, both of whom have
frequently been left behind in the dust
of the advanced and esoteric presen-
tations which such men frequently
produce.

These were different, and the dif-
ference was pleasant. We can only
hope that we get more of the same.

Hit Civilians? “I Probably Did”

ED. NOTE: This story was
written by Mike Norris, a
former Davidson student
who now works for VISTA.

Brakes squealed as the red
Chevy bounced off the road
and skidded to a stop at the
side of the highway.

The driver was a good look-
ing guy motioning. ‘Hurry
up. kid.’ so I threw the bag
in the back seat and jumped
in.

The tires squealed again
and we were off down the
highway. laughing and talk-
ing. Where'm I from?
Where’m I headed? School?

“No, I'm a VISTA. Off on
the highway — you learn a
lot from the highway.”

And he? Just back from
Vietnam. Tail gunner on a

HUEY helicopter. He'd shoot
at anything that moved.

But the civilians — wasn't
he afraid he had hit some
civilians?

“Well, I probably did.”
Pause.

“A village leader during
the day might be a VC at
night.” And the pilot? He did
his part. ‘Whenever I'd shoot

‘my machine gun. he'd fire

his rockets and machine
guns.”"

Didn't he aim?” ‘‘Naw,
he'd just fire them the mo-
ment he heard me fire. Didn’t
matter what they hit.”

He paused again.

“I carried 300 rounds of
ammo with me. If we didn't
see anything to shoot at I'd
be sure to shoot up all the

ammo before we got back to
base.”’

What did you shoot at?
‘Various things. I'd just fire
it all.”

Two years ago a Davidson
senior met a black soldier on
the bus. The soldier was
bumming around 'til he got
up enough guts to kill him-
self.

He'd been on an American
Big Brother mission to Latin
America. They had a sniper
cornered in an old building
and he'd been the one to
throw the grenade.

Inside they found a mother
and two kids.

Collection Of Non-Stories
Gives Insight Into Fiction

ED. NOTE: The book re.
viewed this week, The Wild
Years by Gene Z. Hanra-
han, ed., Dell Books, 75c,
is available at the Student
Store.

By SAM DARBY
Staff Writer

Ernest Hemingway died
five years ago, ‘but I have it
on good authority (by the
grapevine) that he left his
last wife enough manuscripts
to provide for her for the rest
of her life.

However The Wild Years
is evidently not one of .those
manuscripts, but property of
the two Toronto newspapers
for which Hemingway worked
in the early 1920's.

Instead of another Move-
able Feast, which Heming-
way meant to have published,
The Wild Years is ah antholo-
gy of newspaper articles
compiled by an overly zeal-
ous editor, Gene Z. Hanra-
han. who says that these
stories “tell a story as few
books do of the men and
events which made the age
we remember today as the
wild and roaring years.” (See
what I mean bv ‘overly zeal-
ous’?)

The articles are divided in
to five categones according
to their subject matter and
not chronological order. Their
subjects are the issues of the
times (Prohibition. German
reparations, French politics.
Oriental) wars) with a few
stories on the outdoors and
local satire.

But they are not news stor-
ies in the strictest sense be-
cause Hemingway reported
on personalities in relation to
their situations and this: in-
sight removes them from the
the realm of news.

But on the other hand, sim-
ple insight cannot raise them
to the level of lasting litera-
ture. Last week I bought a
print by Picasso because it
was by Picasso.

One would read these stor-
jes by Ernest Hemingway if

one were either a devoted
follower or a serious student
of literature (both must real-
ize that a god like Heming.
way had to learn to write
somewhere).

Throughout these pieces are
scattered devices and turns
of phrasing that became the
gems of his novels and the
essences of his stories. Here
in the early writings one can
see them born—and the wit-
nessing is most engaging.

There are stories (Episode
in the Black Forest) that
compare favorably with his
later work and also examples
of unparalleled reporting
(Amateur Starvers or The
Mark's Last Stand): but most
of them must be waded
through with a pilgrim’s faith
or a mother’s sympathy.

If the prospective reader
were to offer any other rea-
sons, then I would refer him
to The Dark Hills of Africa.

Presidents Into Ploughshares

Washington, D. C.,-was where it was at last week-
end. The march on the Pentagon drew peace people
from all over. the country. Although officially the police ,
estimated the crowd at about 60,000, I would guess the
actual figure was closer te 100,000.

The militant turn which the peace movement has
taken was thrust upon the attention of the nation. Civil
disobedience was presented by march leaders as a
legitimate option for the demonstrators. About three
to five percent of the demonstrators chose this option.
The potential for violence (as opposed to mere civil
disobedience) was present, despite the leadership ef-
forts to encourage a non-violent approach. This pos-
sibility had earlier caused more moderate, older groups
like SANE to withhold sponsorship.

Such a militant attitude stems from two causes.
First, the increasing cynicism on the part of those who
have long. opposed the war through traditional politi-
cal channels has resulted in the withdrawal of many
older people from the tactics of demonstrations and
marches. Secondly, the youthfulness of the demonstra-
tors acted as a spur for greater militancy, since college
students are not normally subject to the restraints
imposed by parenthood and the necessity for steady

employment.

This is not to suggest that the majority of the
marchers were ready to get beaten up, tear gassed, and
arrested. Humor was abundant: one sign read ‘Beat
LBJ into a Ploughshare,” another, “The White Man’s
Burden Is Giving Me a Hernia.” One man, decked out
in mock military regalia, introduced himself as Gen-
eral Hersheybar, and proposed that no-one be allowed
to go to Vietnam unless accompanied by his parents.
Nonetheless, the marchers provided a contrast to the
middle-class, middle-aged, coat-and-tie crowds of, say,

two years ago.

The question of motivation entered my mind as I
viewed the throng at the Lincoln Memorial and at the
Pentagon. ['m sure many of those present came to
Washington because of the lure of the Jefferson Air-
plane and the Fugs. However, I doubt that very many
who came were in favor of the war, even if they were
attracted simply by the entertainment. Also, the dem-
onstration was called a.Mobilization, one of its purposes
being the crystallizing of opposition on the part of the

demonstrators themselves.

This aspect of the demonstration is often over-
looked by detractors who fear that the march failed in
its purpose by alienating the silent Americans who op-
pose the war. The demonstration was conducted as
much for the participants as for the public.

I am not sure as to the long-range value of the
march. I fear that attention is diverted to the marchers
rather than to the Vietnam war. However, the value of
the whole movement in general has been adequately
demonstrated by its continued growth and the increas-
ing opposition of the American public to the war. Per-
haps the long-range effect of this particular march will
be a furtherance of this cause, despite initial negative
reaction on the part of Americans over 25.

Government Influence Dangerous

ED. NOTE: This is the last of a
series of four articles excerpted hy
permission of Random House, Inc.
from The Arrogance of Power by
U. S. Senator J. William Fulbright,
D-Ark., Copyright, 1966 by the
author.

Whatever the circumstances of the
moment, whatever the demands of
government and industry on the uni-
versities—and whatever the rewards
for meeting these demands—the high-
est function of higher education {is
what might be called the teaching
of things in perspective. toward the
purposes of enriching the life of the
individual, cultivating the free and
inquiring mind. and advancing the ef-
fort to bring reason, justice and hu-
manity into the relations of men and
nations.

Insofar as the study of politics is
pertinent to these ends. the university
is properly a place in which scholars
‘analyze existing public policies with
a view to determining whether they
advance or retard the realization of
basic human objectives and whether
and how they should be changed.

Only insofar as the university is
a place in which ideas are valued
above their practical application, in

which there is greater interest in
contributing to the sum of human
knowledge than in helping a govern-
ment agency to resolve some practical
problems, is the university meeting
its academic responsibility to its stu-
dents and its patriotic responsibility
to the country.

Obviously there are great mutual
benefits in relations between the uni-
versities and government, but when
the relationship becomes too close,
too extensive, and too highly valued
by the universities, the higher func-
tions of the university are in danger
of being compromised.

The danger goes far beyond con.
tractual associations with the Central
Intelligence Agency. which, unfortun.
ate though they are, are so egregious
that once they become known, there
is a tendency to terminate them with
all possible haste, although at a last-
ing cost to the integrity of the insti-
tutions involved.

Nor is there great danger inherent
in government-sponsored research of
and by itself; on the contrary, gov-
ernment contracts bring needed
money to the universities and needed
intellectual resources to the govern-
ment. The danger lies rather in the

extent and the conditions. implicit
as well as explicit, of these govern-
mental associations: as long as they
involve secondary functions for the
university they are not harmful, but
when they become primary areas of
activity, when they become the major
source of the university's revenue and
the major source of the scholar’s pres-
tige, then the “teaching of things in
perspective’’ is likely to be neglected
and the universality of the university
compromised.

In lending {tself too much to the
purpose of government, a university
fails of its higher purposes. It is not
contributing to the re-examination of
the ideas of our ancestors on which
human survival depends: it is not
dealing with the central problems of
the first generation in human history
which holds the power of life and
death over its progeny; it is not. in
Archibald MacLeish’s phrase, trying
to produce ‘‘an idea that mankind can
hold to.’’ It is not, therefore, meet-
ing its responsibilities to its students
and to society.

The university, it is true.
separate itself from the society of
which it is a part, but neither can the

annot

ing public policies as if they set limits
scholars proper function, as if the
scolar’s proper function. and only
proper function. were to devise the
technical means of carrying these
policies out.

The proper function of the scholar
is not to exclude certain questions
in the name of practicality, or in
the name of a spurious patriotism,
but to ask all possible questions, to
ask what hes been done wisely and
what has been done foolishly and
what the answers to these questions
imply for the future.

It would be a fine thing indeed if,
instead of spending so much of their
time playing “war games," political
scientists were asking how it came
about that we have had for so long to
devote so great a part of our re-
sources to war and its prevention, and
whether we are condemned by forces
beyond our control te continue to do
so.

The scholar can ask what is wrong
with the “other side,” but he must
not fail to ask as well what is wrong
with our side, remembering always
that the highest devotion we can give
is not to our country as it is -but to s

community of scholars accept-exist-—~.concept of what we would like it to be.
