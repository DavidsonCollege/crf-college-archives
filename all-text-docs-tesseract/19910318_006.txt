Codeword: Ecofeminism

My eco-socio-political orien-
tation as a feminist-environmen-
talist attracted me to the idea of
ecofeminism, even before I really
knew what it was all about. To
those less oriented:towards femi-
nism and ecology, ecofeminism
may seem ridiculous, strange, and
probably scary. Chances are,
however, that the conception the
general public has of ecofeminism
is a misconception.

Ecofeminism is an attempt to
draw relationships between femi-
nism and ecology. It is a mecha-
nism through which these two
movements can work together,
each to benefit the other. Ecofem-
inism tries to answer the question
of what it is in feminism (or ecol-
ogy) that has a specific interest in
ecological concern (or feminist
concerns). Ecofeminism explores
the connection between women,
ecology, and development.

Ecofeminism was started in
developing nations by women. Itis
easier to see the impact of environ-
mental degradation on women in
developing nations due to the
greater immediate dependency

women have ona healthy environ-
- fl

ment in these nations.

One paradigmatic movement in
ecofeminism is the Chipko (“to
hug,” Hindi) movement of north-
ern India. When a company came
into this area to deforest the land,
the women of the nearby villages
banded together and protested by
hugging the trees and refused to let
the trees be cut down. Hence, the
Chipko movement was born.

Women in this area and in many
other developing areas hold a re-
spect for the sustainability, gen-
erativity, and maintenance of the
forests (and other natural resources)
for good reason. The effects of
irresponsible industrialization take
their toll most dramatically on the
livelihoods of women.

In general, women of develop-
ing nations hold the responsibili-
ties of cooking, cleaning, child-
rearing, livestock maintenance, and

working in the fields. Women are
dependent upon healthy and plen-
tiful firewood for cooking, fodder
for feeding livestock, and water.
Women depend on the maintenance
of environmental diversity, healthy
forest ecosystems, and controlled
watershed and flooding in order
for the survival of their communi-
ties.

The effects of irresponsible eco-
nomic development destroy the
way of life for these women and

their communities. Deforestation,
devegetation, and irresponsible ir-
rigation lead to poor water table
levels, desalination, and a scarcity
of firewood and other necessities.
The results include flooding and a
scarcity of wood and food in the
general area, forcing women to
walk up to eight hours a day in
order to sustain their family and
community.

As senior Sandra Smith points
out, “Development for the crea-
tion of markets for economic op-
portunity, and progress defined as
material advancement for a soci-
ety, are not necessarily detrimen-
tal ends in themselves. It is the
means, however, such as exploita-
tion of nature, particularly of non-
renewable resources, destruction
of forests, and attempts to reduce
agriculture to cash crop farming,

that can have irreversible and
damaging effects.”

Irresponsible economic develop-
ment does not consider how to
meet the immediate needs of the
local communities. Instead, it has
alarger vision of an increased GNP,
without considering the physical
quality of life of the majority of the
people this development will ef-
fect. Irresponsible industrialization
has direct negative effects on the
villages and environment, with
women feeling the brunt of the
problems it causes. Therefore,
women have started environmental
movements outof their own direct,
personal involvement with their
environment.

Some ecofeminists, especially
those of developed nations, also
tend to stress the correlation be-
tween the exploitation, abuse, and
rape of women to that of the envi-
ronment. Others want to empha-
size the Woman-Nature relation-
ship.

Obviously, like every other eco-
socio-political movement, ecofem-
inism has a great spectrum of di-
verse ideas. But what must be
stressed about ecofeminism and
every other form of the environ-
mental movement is that the envi-
ronment is not an issue only for
feminists, but it is an issue for
every person who lives on this
earth. ~

Ecofeminism appeals to every-
one concerned about the environ-
ment. Ecofeminism isa movement
which is taking every member of
humanity into the twenty-first
century, and it should be consid-
ered with the utmost seriousness.

ecofeminism, check out Judith
Plant’s Healing Our Wounds (New
Society Publishers) and Vandana
Shiva’ s Staying Alive (Zed Books).

Most of the information for this
article came from conversation
with Sandra Smith, a senior his-
tory major who has done research
in this area.

Depth, Relevance: A Shameless Plea For Help

Dozing at tle Senior Apart-
ments has undergone a transfor-
mation of implication. No longer
can this word imply napping, a
simple rest break for the soul. Such
pastimes belong to times past for
these days, to doze is to bulldoze
and who likes to practice defores-
tation in their sleep?

“Not me,” you say, “Right on!
those bulldozers sure are loud, etc.”
Such reactions are preferred. Being
the first paragraph of an “Opinions
Piece,” column, or, in campus
slang, “Piece of Liberal Propa-
ganda,” the goal is to snow you, the
reader; to get you on the write side,
ie. my side, ergo, the side of the
writer. But please don’t feel brain
washed, then I couldn’t pull the
wool over your eyes.

The train of thought set in
motion in paragraph #1 could
continue along multifarious tracks,
an example of which might be the
following. One could discuss the
mud. Perhaps, if in an investiga-
tive mood, one could go out into
the mud. Sit down in it. Play. Lie
down and make little mud angels.
Smell, wallow, grovel, dissipate

into the goopy glory of upturned
éarth. This is called going the extra
mile and allows one to identify
with the plight of the workers, the
earth movers, the mercenaries, the
tree assassins, the salt of the earth,
depending on your point of view.

The astute Opinionator might
then associate things. Weigh, per-
haps, the temporary aesthetic blight
of scarred earth against the perma-
nent aesthetic blight of dorm build-
ings too close together and decide,
is it worth the pain? The aforemen-
tioned Opinionator would be as-
tute because either interpretive op-
tion demonstrates her conviction
that the dorms are dippy, Cancers!
Unseemly boils on the epidermis
of us all. .

This possibility, of course, has

‘nothing to do with the editorial

stance of the DEPTH, RELE-
VANCE! society. We write for
Opinions and thus care only for
effect. Truth dulls the soul.

The great thing about the Opin-
ions business is that you can say
anything, especially in The
Davidsonian since we're so des-
perate for material. I could tell you

for instance about the proverb I
recently came across. It stated,
“Man, if you ever wanna’ steal
something, robaGirl Scout. That'd
be the easiest crime in the world! “
This statement followed hard upon
the speaker’s discovery that the

in Comelius on Friday. Very in-

They devoted enormous
amounts of time and energy into
making the drive happen, even
when it looked rather hopeless.
Their commmitment to this proj-

its success, and I am proud to say
that I have had the chance to work

Hackett Responds to "Jones" Article

To the Editor:

I must make some clarifica-
tions pertaining to my article about
Alan Jones (March 11). The ar-
ticle's title (which was not my own)
misleadingly suggests that Alan's
piece "Two Suns" is a "jazz"
composition. Rather, it and his
entire "Electric Journey" cassette
are in a decidedly "new age" vein,
given their free-flowing, atmos-
pheric stylings and Alan's exclu-
sive implementation of electronic
synthesis (both techniques are
popular, though not universal in
the genre).

Categorization is a danger to
truly original music; it limits the
potential audience for new music
and, by establishing pre-set
boundaries, restricts its artistic
scope. Thus, one must always use

their own ears and decide for them-
selves (including those who take it
upon themselves to title music
articles). In any case, "jazz" is not
"new age", however you define
those styles. fe

As for "fame"- no one would
scoff at radio airplay; getting this
kind of music on the radio is a
special achievement, but Alan
would agree that fame has yet to
grace him. We'll wait for a Jones
article in downbeat to make that
decision.

Also, credit is due to David
Floyd, engineer at Jay Howard
productions, who took the photo of
Alan.

sightful.

One could also scribble about
Cushmans. I met someone who
claimed they dreamed aboutcrazed
security buggies running them
down from every direction. Sortof
Christine-ish, I guess. The escort
comes to get you, but. . . there’s
NO DRIVER! This same person
considered in-class nose picking a
column-worthy subject. Writer’s
block or no writer’s block, I’ve
gotta draw the line somewhere,
and I may as well do it in boogers.

Hats are a stellar subject as
well. Particularly apropos might
be the rule in the Baker weight
room stating “No Hats Allowed.”

This is a very wise legalism.
» Someone could be hanging

upside down from the pull-up
bar wearing a hat. A careless fel-
low pumper might drop aweight, a
big one, and itmightcatch the brim
of the previously discussed hat on
the way down. If the hat-ban failed
to disconnect from the poor
hanger’s head, how disastrous that
would be. One deCAPitation is
one decapitation too many.

InOpinionating, flippancy can

be very useful.

Finally, as all pap must, this
too shall end. In closing I would
just like to say, what we need in
this decadent age of ours is more
WILLING WOMEN, dammit!

Such statements normally
cause approximately half of one’s
readers’ eyeballs to get noticably
larger.

Yes, as each day passes our
society experiences an increasingly
unconscionable numberof females
dying with absolutely no instruc-
tions whatsoever left behind about
what to do with their personal
possessions.

It’samazing, absolutely amaz-
ing thatone can get away with such
statements. So write for Opinions.
If you don’t fill the space we will!
