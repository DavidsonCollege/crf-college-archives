elsof how human beings should
integrate themselves as part of
their environment.

“The air in the sky and the
water in the rivers and clouds
flow across the globe without
recognizing national bounda-
ries,” observes Dr. Rolston.

-“Humans must also learn to

flow across the world in such a
manner. Besides, national
boundaries aren’t very intelli-
gently related to geology.”

The philosophy professor cites
Socrates as observing that man
is a political animal. However,

“Can we have an appropriate
respect for the whole Earth?” asks
Rolston. ““We need a new idea of
who we are and where we are as
residents of the Earth.”

bian students nor possess a non-
discriminatory clause on the basis
of sexual orientation. (The faculty
and staff of Middlebury College
have endorsed a non-discrimina-
tory clause which is presently
pending trustee approval.) When
told this fact, the student responded,
“I’m encouraged that not all col-
leges are like Davidson.”

In another interview a homo-
sexual studentexplained, “It wasa
traumatic moment to admit to
myself that ] am a homosexual. . .
Notall gay men go clubbing in the
big cities dressed in leather and
chains. Some homosexuals wear
fraternity letter, button downs and
duckheads. Some even have girl-
friends.” Because of social expec-
tations, this student dated a woman
for a year before admitting to
himself he was a homosexual. “I
am not romantically or sexually
attracted to women. I was sexually
active with my girlfriend because
that pleased her, not because I
wanted to.”

Criticizing the “naive blind-
ness” on campus, the student re-
counted, “Once an acquaintance
told me, ‘Oh, there aren’t any gay
students at Davidson.” This as-
sumption not only pervades the
student body, but also influences
some professors. The homosexual
student noted that in a lecture a
professor remarked, “We will all
have to deal with the opposite
gender in sexual relationships.”
Not 10% of the population. Dis-
cussing the immoral life of a play-
wright, another professor com-.
mented outside of class, “First of
all he was gay, of course that is not
that nasty. . .” Onhearing of this
remark the gay student asked “If
racist remarks are unacceptable,
why isn’t the disparagement of
homosexuals?”

This fall Dr. Maloney of the

. religion department conducted a
survey in his contemporary moral
issuesclasses, He asked fifty-eight
students if they would vote for a

tions are his greatest. He points
out that although he is a political
animal, man is Earth-bound and
therefore his greatest responsibil-
ity is to his environment.
“Although the planet has pro-
duced abrilliantevolutionary crea-
ture with hands and a mind, that
creature can become a cancer to
the planet if itcan’t show with it’s
hands and mind that it has an ap-
propriate respect for that planet,”

qualified woman for president. Ten
percent responded “no.” When the
candidate was jewish, five percent
refused; when the candidate was
black, 7% refused. 57% of the
students said that they would not
vote for a homosexual.

In response to these statistics,
the gay student suggested, “There
aren’tany visible homosexual role
models on campus.” Dr. Rose-
marie Tong, a philosophy profes-
sor who taught ten years at Wil-
liams College before coming to
Davidson, agrees. She largely at-
tributes the success of the gay and
lesbian alliance at Williams to the
respected faculty members who
openly joined the organization. Ac-
cording to Leslie Marsicano, a
similar phenomenon occurred at
Duke University.

Advocating homosexual rights,
agay professor at Middlebury Col-
lege has written columns for the
campus newspaper. A recent sur-
vey at Middlebury determined that
only 5% of 110 students surveyed
“strongly feared or hated homo-
sexuality.”

The gay Davidson student I
interviewed described his experi-
ence here:

“College is supposedly the envi-
ronmentin which you explore who
are. I missed that at Davidson.
One essential part of my life has
been neglected for four years. I
have had some gay friendships,
but overall they are hard to find in
this repressiveatmosphere. I often
feel no one understands me. I’m
leaving Davidson without people
really knowing who I am and that
feels dishonest. I would be afraid
to come out publicly here.
Davidson can be brutal socially if
youare differentin any way. Intel-
lectually, I havereally grown here;
unfortunately, I have had to sacri-
fice my education in other areas.”

Both Leslie Marsicano, the as--

sistant Dean of Students, and Ruth
Pittard, the Union Program Advi-
sor, admit, “Currently, we do not
take care of the gay population at
all.” In the past four years, the
Dean of Students Office occasion-

Rolston believes that the chief
worry of the last half of this cen-
tury has been, will humans destroy
themselves? He thinks, however,
that the chief worry of the upcom-
ing century is going to be, will
humans destroy the world?

“The military is a threat to any
sort of Earth ethic,” claims Rol-
ston. “The distribution of natural
resources has been the center of
many wars throughout the ages.”

As people change, the world
also changes. Dr. Rolston pointed
out that the relative size of the
planetis decreasing as man’s popu-
lation and man’s ability to travel
across the world quickly increase.
From a philosophical standpoint,
this will force man to make trade-
offs and decisions about what is
truly valuable in the world.

Dr. Rolston agrees with the
Bible’s prophecy of who will ob-
tain power here on Earth.

““The meek shall inherit the
Earth’, only in an environmental
sense the meek will be powerful
creatures who are able to control
their power.”

ally advertised a post office box
for gay and lesbian correspon-
dence. However, of the few re-
sponses, most were abusive. This
year the post office box is alto-
gether defunct.

Davidson’s history and size do
notexcuse this apathy. Amherst, a
student body of 1600, not only
offers support groups for its gay
and lesbian population but also
films, speakers and discussions
open to the entire campus. Known
traditionally as aconservative “rich
white boy school,” Amherst was
an all male college until 1976.
Today, its Lesbian, Bisexual and
Gay Alliance has 35 members; a
second organization for the friends
of lesbians, bisexuals and gays has
amailing listof400 students. Most
colleges with which Davidson
compares itself similarly educate
their campus communities.
Swarthmore, a student body of
1330,and Bowdoin, astudent body
of 1350, also present forums and
speakers addressing gay and les-
bian discrimination.

A few members of the
Davidson community are initiat-
ing efforts to understand homo-
sexuality. The campus forum
committee is scheduling speakers
on gay. and lesbian issues for an
eleventh hour next fall. This April,
during alumni week, Karen Hester,
a Davidson graduate, is sponsor-
ing areception for gay and lesbian
students, faculty and friends.

Davidson’s liberal arts educa-
tion is ideally a social educatioft.
As Dr. Tong expressed, “It is an
invitation to expand one’s sympa-
thies, to eradicate narrowness of
mind and constrictions of heart.”
A heterosexual student I inter-
viewed accepts this invitation. One
reason he did not attend an equally
competitive liberal arts college was
its high gay population, Ironi-
cally, he now rooms with a homo-
sexual at Davidson. Hecomments,
“Homosexuality used to scare me.
I know my parents would not
approve of my friendship with my
roommate, but he has helped me
overcome a prejudice. I think that
is very healthy.” ae

said Fowler. “Environmental con-
trol went from a political liability to
an asset for politicians.”

Yet, Fowler noted, much has
changed in the last 12 months,
particularly with the Persian Gulf
War. “History will judge the war as
a classic conflict of natural re-
sources,” said Fowler. “Nobody
can imagine a more heinous act
than the deliberate oil spill and
setting 600 to 800 oil wells on fire.
No one, in my mind, can excuse
Saddam Hussein from environ-
mental terrorism.”

The war, Fowler said, also
showed our own failures as well.
The fact that we have begun to dig
deeper for fossil fuels indicates the
need for a new environmental pol-
icy. “We thought we crossed the
river in 1990, but we have a_lot of
ground to cover,” stated Fowler.
“Bush deserves accolade for put-
ting together an international coali-
tion for the war, but wouldn’t it be
wonderful if such a coalition was
put together for the environment?”

Fowler, however, admitted that
while running for Senate he never
foresaw the environmentasan elec-
tion issue. What was amazing,
according to Fowler, was the

amount of people who asked,
“Why is it that the government
cannot insure that the air we
breathe, the food we eat and the
water we drink is .not contami-
nated.” “All ofa sudden the envi-
ronmental problem had mystically
been transferred into an issue of
health,” said Fowler. “It does not
go away.”

Fowler then focused on the
future of the environment. “The
next war in Middle East,” predi-
cated Fowler,” will be over the
water in the Gulf.” He supported
his hypothesis by stating that the
Governor of California has to de-
cide whether or not to import water
from Canada because of the
drought that state is experiencing.
Seventy percent of all water used
for agriculture, noted Fowler, is
imported.

Although Fowler found
Bush’s environmental policy
“woefully inadequate,” he was
hopeful that the President would
be able to address this problem
during a*time of extraordinary
unity in Congress, especially the
energy crisis. “The more depend-
ent we become on fossil fuel,”
concluded Fowler, “the more de-
pendent we become. More benign
forms of fuel would lessen our
dependence.”
