THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1961

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor).

Victims Of Ambiguity

The Executive Committee last
week campused for four months eight
members of the soccer team under the
Red Book regulation prohibiting
“drinking . . . while attending an off-
campus event sponsored wholly or in
part by Davidson College.”

Without entering into the judg-
ment on the guilt or innocence of the
students involved, THE DAVIDSON-
IAN wishes to protest the rule under
which the boys were tried.

It has been common knowledge
for some time among students and
faculty members that drinking has
occurred on trips sponsored by the
college, and no action has been taken.
Indeed, the term “college sponsored
event” has been interpreted ambig-
uously; the rule has not been applied
to after-dance parties.

This purely expedient “solution”
points up the unenforceability of the
regulation: why is an athletic trip any
more a college-sponsored event than
a publications convention. a student
council conclave, a dramatics trip—or
a fraternity after-dance party?

The students in this case are un-
fortunately the victims of a long-
dormant regulation open to ambiguous
interpretation. This is not the only
regulation on which there is question
of meaning and interpretation in the
minds of students. Earlier this fall the
Student Council president, Honor

Court chairman, and editor of THE’

DAVIDSONIAN went before adminis-
tration officials seeking to prevent
just such an unfortunate case. No
statement was made on this particular
issue at that time.

The ambiguities have remained,
yet the Executive Committee has been
forced to take action in this case. Does
this action represent its answer to the
problem? We hope not. A single en-

“~forcement of a regulation does not
constitute a clarification, nor does it
take into consideration the basic
questions of the justice and enforce-
ability of the rule.

We suggest a re-examination of
this regulation. It is our opinion that
it should be eliminated.

The YMCA -- Project Alert?

Fulton Lewis III and Prof: Patter-
son have rescued the YMCA lecture
series on Communism from a rather
unfortunate beginning in assembly
Monday and given it a strong impetus.
The beginning has been interesting
and worth-while. The future is nebu-
lous.

As plans now stand, the YMCA
is considering spending its remaining
funds on three speakers, Eugene
“Lyons. Franklin L. Budette, and Al-
bert Burke, ail of whom place strong
emphasis on the problem of Commun-
ist aggression . and Communist
methods.

A YMCA spokesman has describ-
ed the primary purpose of the series
as an informative one. It is designed
to acquaint the student with the prob-
lems of Communism as a basis for
the student’s own evaluation. As such,
it fits very properly into the YMCA
Area of Citizenship.

If the YMCA is to carry out its
purpose .in this series, however, it
must make the series more inclusive
than it now plans. As the program now
stands, there will be no speaker who
will deal with Communism as an

ideology and its meaning to Western
philosophy and the Western Christian
tradition. The series as.it is now
planned seems also to take a very
“conservative’’ tack—a one-sidedness
which violates the purpose of the
series to inform the student.

If the YMCA truly seeks to build
good citizens at Davidson, we com-
mend them. If they intend to turn the
Citizenship Area into an _ alarmist
“Project Alert,” we are not in sympa-
thy with their aims. In the Era of
John Birch, it is necessary that the
YMCA select its speakers with a care-
ful and judicious eye, taking a long
lonk at their views and qualifications.

Communism is an issue about which
there are many colors and shades of
opinion. We hope that the YMCA will
make a genuine effort to present the
full spectrum, presenting each opinion
as fully and justly as possible. The
YMCA Cabinet should take care that
the building of the series reflects a
real interest in truly informing the
student and does not reflect the opin-
ions and interests of one individual.

A Service Suggested

With the recent abundance of
good lectures and fine musical pro-
grams, it has become obvious that
Davidson should be doing something
to preserve the benefits and enjoy-
ment of these events.

A busy schedule and other ob-
ligations often prevent interested
students and faculty from attending
all these activities. At a recent 1-2-5
luncheon in Charlotte, an alumnus
was commenting on the many “educa-
tional’ attractions scheduled which
he would unfortunately be unable to
attend. “I wish the college could do
something to make them available to
people like me,” he lamented.

Something could be done. With
the equipment presently available,
permanent tapes could be made of all
the more outstanding lectures, regu-
lar performances of the Male Chorus
and Concert Band and special guest
recitals like the recent organ convo-
cation. Addresses of the calibre of
the Reynolds Lectures and Otts Lec-
tures deserve more permanence than
they now receive.

During Dr. Tillich’s recent visit,
tapes of his lectures were made by
the Mental Health Center in Char-
lotte, which is donating copies of
them to the college. These could be
the excellent beginning of a new
permanent library of tapes to be
housed in the fine arts building.

This library would be available
for student and faculty borrowing or
playing on the college's tape recorder
in the Cunningham Building. Copies
could be sent out by mail, at a slight
fee, for individuals, alumni meetings
or the like.

Printed copies of the lectures
could also be obtained from the tapes
There is always a local demand for
copies of vespers sermons and other
speeches and many students would
welcome printed copies. These would
also satisfy a need from the alumni
standpoint. Complete texts or summar-
ies might be distributed to them reg-
ularly. In this way, the college could
truly extend its continuing service and
benefit to its alumni, which it has in-
dicated a desire in doing.

Disdain For USSR, Facts

Dr. John Turkevich,. Phi Beta
Kappa Visiting Scholar, drew a
crowd of 23 Davidson commun-
ity regulars and 14 students (in-
cluding two Phi Bete’s) for his
lecture on “Science and Educa-
tion in Russia.” This presenta-
tion in Hodson Hall on Tuesday,
Nov. 28, concluded a two-day

visit to the campus..

After a slow start, Dr. Turke-
vich got down to business. Put-
ting aside “all that business
about steel production,” he pre-
dicted the ultimate failure of
Communism. Communism will
not win because Communism as
a system is an inefficient way
to run a government and be-
cause the Russian worker is un-
able to produce so well as the
American.

TRANQUILIZING EFFECT

Disregarding such boring fact-
ual details as steel production;
ignoring unimportant matters
such as the ability of a socialist
dictatorship to mobilize, con-
centrate, and unify its indus-
trial, scientific, and cultural ef-
forts in a way unknown to
Western capitalism, this scholar
was able to allay our fears with-
in a few minutes of the opening
of his address,

A dynamic and persuasive
speaker, Turkevich appealed to
the full range of American pride
—~from “America sits on the
sunny heights of a mountain en-
joying the fruits of life” to
plumbing. “I was wrong in my
newspaper statement about Rus-
sian toilet facilities, they don't
need 200,000 new units, they
need two million!”

Ah, America! the land of the
indoor john and Delsey Tissue

RUSSIAN EDUCATION

Dr. Turkevich did, however,
present some very. interesting
details about Russian education

BY LEE KIRBY

from his own personal exper-
ience.

Although the schodls are
rigorous in their discipline and
graduation is dependent upon an
examination at the end of high
school, grades lower than ‘‘ex-
cellent’ or “good” are. seldom
given because of pressure from
the people.

LABORER-STUDENTS

There is a great stigma attach-
ed to low grades because the
Soviets never account for dif-
ferences in talent or interest
among students. “In Russia,
everybody is considered capable
of doing everything!”

A new system of Marxist
“Polytechnical” education has
been instituted which requires
that all high school students do
some practical work and that
évery high school graduate work
two years in a factory before
entering the university.

The admission of a student to
the umiversity is contingent
upon the vote of the worker’s
committee in the plant in which
he works. The polytechnical
system teaches the students the
dignity of labor and the worker
and helps solve the problem of
university admissions and over-
crowding.

PROGRESS DOWNGRADED

Russian technology, Turke-
vich emphasized, is not nearly
so highly developed as the
American’s. The Russians have
made their spectacular achieve-
ments by concentrating in
special areas at the expense of
other areas and basic research.
Using American research, they
boast that they will “ride our
backs to victory.”

“I just don’t see how the Rus-
sians send up their rockets after
carrying them on those rickety
trains and in those outdated
trucks on those rough roads!”

Dr. ‘rurkevich exclaimed.

What Dr. Turkevich ignored is
that the Russians have sent up
those rockets. Their basic re-
search may be weak, they may
ride our. backs, but this is no-
thing new. The United States
rode the back of European re-
search in developing our tech-
nology, but we still developed.
Dr. Turkevich did poor justice
to a history which shows that
the Russians are able to accom-
plish their goals and come
through in a pinch in spite of
their draw-backs.

REVISIONIST TREND

Dr. Turkevich’s speech is a
part of a “revisionist” trend in
our evaluation of Russia. There
is no need to fear, the 37 faith-
ful were told: the Russian Giant,
like Premier Khrushchev (‘Mr.
Nibbs” to Turkevich), is “just
so high—just two feet tall!”

The lecture was an interesting
and informative one, but it pre-
sented a view which seemed a
bit superficial. Too often, Dr.
Turkevich made his statements
@ priori without backing them
up by a factual analysis. Too
often he spoke in the tone of an
agent of the State Department
or Chamber of Commerce, for
whom he has done service in
Russia.

SPEAKS KNOWINGLY

Replying to this reporter's
question about a recent com-
parative study of American and
Russian education in the human-
ities, he commented, “The fel-
low probably didn’t even know
Russian! I’ve seen that kind of
people go over there and do
those studies!”

Dr. Turkevich's lecture un-
fortunately disguised the fact
that he is a scholar; what he
was not able to disguise was his
Russian heritage—he is a na-
tural born propogandist.

Diaz Interprets Adlai's
Revolutionary Suggestion

BY TONY DIAZ

Adlai Stevenson, United
States Ambassador to the United
Nations and especial envoy of
President Kennedy to South
America last year, when rep7rt-
ing his impressions to the Presi-
dent, asked for “a revolution
in order to end with feudalism
in Latin-America” and also as
the only way to stop communist
infiltration in our hemisphere.

Persons I talked with this
Summer were very much sur-
prised by the suggestions of this
distinguished North American
politician, since recent events
witnessed by the world have
been able to measure what these
“revolutions” can signify. Bo-
livia, Argentian, Cuba are good
examples.

Stevenson’s declaration, never-
theless, has a perfect explana-
tion. We all know that when a
foreign dignitary arrives in our
countries, as soon as he has step-
ped off his plane he is surround-
ed by politians intent upon get-
ting U. S. foreign aid.

NEW DEALER

Stevenson’s declaration fav-
oring a revolution is also ex-
plained since he is a “new deal-
er.” The North American new
dealer is considered by many in
South America to be a version, a
little bit corrected and pasteur-

ized, of the South American left-
ist who is half socialist, half
radicalist and who believes that
Capitalism is bound to disap-
pear.

The new dealer believes very
much in the State as a regula-
tor of life, and pays tribute to
the economy directed from
above not realizing, however,
that North American greatness
was made and is still being made
from below.

The bad thing about Steven-
son and his declarations is his
influence in the circle that sur-
rounds President Kennedy.

REVOLUTIONARY RESULTS

Revolutions don’t work if they
intend to increment the nation-
al income of a country; they
make it fall to the lowest levels.
Nor do revolutions work when
they intend to bring freedom,
because when the social struc-

ture of a country is changed by
violent means the only way to
keep these changes standing is
terror, whether the revolution
comes from the people or from
the government. Poverty is only
conquered with prosperity, in
my dictionary that is to say
work, labor; but the prere-
quisite for human labor is free-
dom.

For many years the U. S.
commited the mistake of giving
their warm sympathy to the
Latin American oppressors;
feeling that we were not ready
or mature enough for freedom
yet.

If the U. S. followed Steven-
son’s advice, it would commit
a second and unforgivable mis-
take. Revolutions don't serve to
build up countries, nor to pull
them out of misery, nor to as-
sure them freedom.

Double TUC System Logic

BY BOB IVEY

In covering a recent uprising of the natives of the
distant land of 4 bsalom (David’s son) Harry Hotscoop has
forwarded us the basic information about the situation.

that the grand sovereign and his advisors
(consisting of some bored trustees from the old folks
home and a Tourists’ Board) are having difficulty in
explaining the reasoning behind one of their long-stand.
ing policies.

The government here owns and controls all of the
labor in fis lovely land from its central office on the
hill. The laborers are required to work at their tasks
every day in order to receive their wages semiannually.

Other than recent loss of leg, head, or life, the only
way they may be excused from their work is by the in-
genious system of TUCs (Tasks Uncompleted Condoned)
given by the government. Usually, four TUCs are given
to each laborer semiannually, allowing him to take his
absences as he desires, one TUC per day.

The recent trouble was brought about from the fact
that these officials charge double for TUCs used immed-
iately before and after the Festival periods. This means
that those who live in the far away land of Faraway have
no opportunity to take advantage of the entire Festival
period without forfeiting an extra TUC each time—giv-
ing them a total of two days vacation per half year period
if they desire to be with their fellow Farawaians at
Festival seasons. The natives have submitted that this
is unreasonable—to be given free time and then to be

penalized for using it.

The thinking of the government seems to be that
just because labor is carried on on the days immediately
preceding and following Festival days, they will attempt
to force the workers to be there, even though the work is
no more important then than on any other day—and
even though production can be carried on just as suc-
cessfully with fewer men for one or two days. Their only
statement concerning this has been that we do this so
that we can stop work when we say we will.

In other words, this government seems to be en-
forcing laws just because they have been made and en-
forced in years past, and because they are upheld by a
few other small townships who are in the same rut.

Thinks may improve, however, for Harry Hotscoop
reports that at a recent press conference, the grand
sovereign indicated that he himself might well be in
favor of a more liberal TUC system.

Let’s hope so, for after all, if any group of people
is capable of regulating their own absences, certainly
these sons of David are.

Concern For Peace Stirs
Students To Demonstrate

BY BILL HAGEN
Davedsonian Managing Editor

To promote concern—this was the reason 45 stud-
ents fasted over the Thanksgiving holidays.

Students from Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith,
colleges, and the University of Massachusets picketed
the White House on Thanksgiving day, eating nothing,
to demonstrate against resuming above-ground nuclear
testing.

A spokesman for the group said that, “We want to
dramatize to families at home on this day of abundance
that there should be concern for public discussion of
this matter.”

A similar group from Cornell (lowa) College drank
only water during a 72 hour period; carrying on a “Vigil
for Peace” begun the week before by students from
Grinnell, Carleton, and Bluffton colleges.

Silently marching, as they did for at least five hours
a day, with a chilling wind and early Christmas shoppers
for company, the placard carriers looked ridiculously out
of place. A few tourists, trying for the White House, even
took their picture.

But their very orderliness and gravity, perhaps an
alien phenomena to some goldfish-bred elders, gave a
certain dignity to their purpose. More used to reading
about bed-pushing marathons, curious passers-by were
probably a little surprised to see, on the statements of
purpose handed out, “We are making this trip . . . to
demonstrate our concern and show our willingness to
work for peace.

“Although we hope to convince our campus and
friends of the immediacy of this problem, we feel a
great need for other students on other campuses to
demonstrate their concern in some way.

“We do not plan to stop our efforts with a trip to
Washington. When we return to school we will continue
to work constructively for peace in campus and national
groups, and by further discussion and study.”

___Inacity accustomed to causes, this idealistic optomis-
tic statement rang singularly true. One was prompted to
ask, “How many times have the American people made
the stockpiling of bombs or hatred of the enemy a
national purpose rather than peace?”

; Surely, as utopian as it may sound, it is better to
epitomize this than the ideas of building up a “balance
of terror” on one hand or meek submission on the other,
with an alternate to both of enslavery and dsath that the
extremists would have us embrace.

The idea of “peace on earth...” won’t be achieved
by witch hunts and simple hatred of all Reds. A man
guilty, until proven innocent, public charges made by
government officials, without a following trial, condem-
nation for using a constitutional right . . . Fascists hated
Communists too.

“If our demonstration makes others give more
thought to the problem, if they are moved by what we
have done, if they decide to make a committment to work
for peace, then we will feel that our efforts have been
worth-while.”
