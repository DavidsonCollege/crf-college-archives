NEWS
Davidson town planning moves forward

By Randy Hartwell
At an October 25th Board of
Commissioners meeting, work
continued on Davidson’s monu-

way it is,” she says. “I came to
Charlotte 35 years ago, and I’ve
seen it ruined by growth and
change.” .

Barbara Freund, co-owner of
Main Street Books, vehemently
opposes Davidson’s anticipated
growth. “I like it [Davidson] the

inevitable — it’s so hard; you want
it to stay autonomous.” She adds,
“The days of town and gown are
gone.”

students

concerned

Many students are unaware
that although their initial transcript
is free, the Registrar’s office has
raised the price of additional tran-
scripts from one dollar to three
dollars. Registrar Polly Griffin
cites legitimate reasons for the in-
crease; however, many students
complain that they already spend
enough money on tuition and fees
to cover this relatively minor cost.

Senior Steve Krause says the
change is ‘ridiculous, because it is
the college’s job to help students
get a job or apply to graduate
school. This process is already
expensive, and I donot believe that
it costs three dollars to produce a
transcript.” Krause believes that
students should “get at least one
transcript free each year.”

Griffin says that although the
fee had been the same for several
years, one dollar “did not cover the
costs.” Sheexplains that because
of mailing bills and labor, it costs
much more than a dollar to pro-
duce a transcript. She believes that
three dollars is a “much better rep-
resentation of the costs.” The
money from the transcripts goes
back into a general fees account.

The cost of transcripts is at-
tributed almost entirely to labor.
Griffin says that the job of produc-
ing transcripts takes “35% to 40%”
of a person’s job in the Registrar’s
office.

After deciding that the one
dollar fee did not accurately repre-
sent the costs of producing a tran-
script, the Registrar’s office de-
cided to look at what other similar

‘schools charged for transcripts.

Some schools like Wesleyan and
Swarthmore charge five dollars,
while others like Washington and
Lee have an administrative fee built
into the tuition bill and do not
charge for each transcript. Griffin
decided that a rise to five dollars
would be too drastic; thus the three
dollar charge represents acompro-
mise in her eyes. She did not feel
that it would be fair to have the
administrative cost, because cur-
rent students would then be paying
for the transcripts of graduates.
Griffin wants to emphasize that
this change was not an “arbitrary
change” and represented signifi-
cant research,

Griffin adds that she is “very
sympathetic” to the concerns of

_ the students, but that the increase

was necessary. She said that there
is good news, because students can
“charge the fee to their accounts
and-not have to pay for them in
cash.”

Senior Josh Rogers says that

__the change is “‘another way for the

Registrar’s office to fund itself”
and believes it is “hard to justify a
300% increase.” Rogers does not
feel that Davidson should compare
itself to other schools and “try to
conform to what they are doing.”

mental task of finding the best
course of action forthe town’s new
and expected growth. To do this,
an 18-member land development
planning commission will be ap-
pointed, consisting of the nine
members of the planning board as
well as nine town residents.

Town planner Tim Keane feels
confident about his prospects for
the establishment of a unified mis-
sion. ‘‘We’ve gotten to a point
where people want to do some-
thing,” he says. In anticipation of
this, a workshop will be held on
November 12 at UNCC with David
Walters, an architect and urban
designer.

On November 28, a town
meeting to discuss the land plan
will be held at Town Hall. While
many residents anxiously await the
progress of a bustling new town,
some look back wistfully on
Davidson’s picturesque past.

Lou Green of the Christa Faut
Gallery says, “I think growth is

Davidson townspeople fear potential, looming development.

Concentrations: International studies,
neuroscience, and medical humanities

By Beth Lindsey

International Studies

Beginning in the 1987-88 aca-
demic year, International Studies
was the first concentration intro-
duced at Davidson. There have
been between 10 and 22 students
in each graduating class, with 13

. students enrolled in the graduating

class of 1995.

The program has several dis-
tinct facets including the incorpo-
ration of classes of an international
and/or multicultural nature, profi-
ciency ina foreign language, anda
study or work experience outside
of the United States.

Says Dr. Clark Ross, Profes-
sor of economics, “I really like the
idea of having a distinct major and
being able to build on their interest
in an interdisciplinary study. To
me, the transcript recognition is
not as much the emphasis. of a
concentration than is the opportu-
nity for a student to explore an area
of his or her interest in a certain
area. A student’s interest in the
subject is what really matters.”

Anotherimportant facet of this
study is the emphasis on contem-
porary problems. “The problems

‘of today’s. society simply cannot

be solved by looking at it solely in
a historical, economical, or social
context. This program aims at
involving students in an interdisci-
plinary that is representative of the
teal world.”

Applications should be sub-
mitted by the conclusion of the

drop/add period of the fall semes- -

ter of the senior year to accommo-
date those studying abroad during
their junior year. Questions can be
addressed to Dr. Clark Ross.

Medical Humanities

The Medical Humanities con-
centration consists of 50 sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors along
with six to eight students who are
majoring in Medical Ethics through
the Center for Interdisciplinary
Studies. There are 20 faculty mem-
bers involved in this program. ,

“The concentration really
helps us to pull together from a
variety of different disciplines, in-
volving a diverse number of de-
partments which provide different
ways of thinking but maintain a
principle unity around a common
theme,” says Dr. Rosemarie Tong,
Professor of Medical Humanities
and Philosophy.

“It presents to students a
broadly conceived notion of medi-
cine and health care reflecting the
fundamental issues which affect
the human psyche. The interdisci-
plinary nature is necessary for this
subject matter due to the large num-

ber of considerations when con-

fronting issues of health care and
medicine in today’s society.”
While Dr. Tong likes the con-

cept of the concentration because
it can primarily be built upon the
courses already being offered, she
says concentrations also provide a
reason to offer new courses. “A
faculty member may get an idea
for a new course that would fit
under this topic while the exist-
ence of this concentration could
also cause a department to choose
to initiate course X over course Y
because it now has this added use.”

Applications for the Medical
Humanities concentration should
be submitted by the last day of the
spring semester of the sophomore
year. Any questions concerning
the program can be directed to Dr.
Rosemarie Tong.

Neuroscience

The Neuroscience concentra-
tion, am in-depth study of the brain,
has been in place since 1992. It
was first initiated by Dr. Julio
Ramirez, a professor in the psy-
chology department, because he
simply felt the time was appropri-
ate, and Davidson does have the
faculty to support it.

Participants mainly include

psychology, biology, and chemis-
try majors with an average of two
to five students graduating each
year as neuroscience concentra-
tors. :

“The concentration technique
is really ideal for the study of neu-
roscience, for it allows for much
more flexibility within a curricu-
lum. Developing areas in science
can be explored not only in-depth

‘but more importantly on a interdis-

ciplinary level,” says Ramirez. “It
includes an intensive laboratory
combined with a pedagogical fo-
cus, involving student exploration
of a particular problem from mul-
tiple perspectives.”

The program itself. includes
two required courses along with
four elective courses which can be
chosen from the list of possibilities
found in the course catalog.

Applications must be received
by the last day of the spring semes-
ter of the sophomore year for con-
sideration. Dr. Julio Ramirez of
the psychology department can
answer any questions.
