Ironman Cowan
downplays streak

By MICHAEL KRusE
Sports Editor

Senior lineman John Cowan,
who will co-captain this year’s
Wildcats with linebacker A.R.
Barrington, has started all 30 games
since he arrived on campus three
years ago. But the 6-2, 240-

Football Notebook

pounder from Cartersville, Ga.,
dubbed “the glue” of the team by
Landis, insists the Ripkenesque
stretch is not on his mind: “I feel
like I’m really lucky to have had
that opportunity, but I honestly
don’t think about it. I just think
about winning football games.” .

Last year’s traditional red
pants, black (home) and white
(away) jerseys, and red helmets
broughta dissapointing 1-8-1 mark.

So to go with their new and
improved size and speed, the Wild-
cats will sport spiffy new uniforms
this season.

The duds, which will hope-
fully translate into more wins, fea-
ture a white pants - black jersey -
black helmet ensemble at home
and a black pants - white jersey -
black helmet combo on the road.
The pants also have a pawprint on
the left hip.

And don’t be surprised to see
the team break out in an intimidat-
ing all-black outfit for an espe-
cially big game this fall. : .

Emory & Henry (Va.),
Davidson’s Sept. 28 Homecoming
opponent, was ranked 12th in the
country in Sports Illustrated’s Di-
vision III pre-season poll. The
Wasps, who own a 22-game home
winning streak and are among the
nation’s leaders in D-III atten-

dance, blanked the Wildcats in last

year’s meeting, 32-0. . .

Sophomore speedster Karim
Lawrence, who ran track last
spring, is playing organized foot-
ball for the first time in his life.
Called “a project” by Landis,
Lawrence should ultimately be-
come a deep threat. . .

James Cassidy, Davidson’s
all-time sack king (22.5) who, as a
senior last year, set the school single
season sack standard with 11, cur-
rently plays for the Munich Cow-
boys at the highest professional
level of American football in Ger-
many. Cassidy is one of seven past
Davidson players or coaches who
have taken partin pro football over-
seas since 1993...

Davidson will scrimmage
Schowan, a Division III school that
faces many of the same Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference
(ODAC) teams the Wildcats play,
on Saturday in Murphysboro, N.C.
The team will then have two weeks
to prepare for its Sept. 14 opener at

Maryville (Tenn.).. .

gional top 10, which includes all
schools in North Carolina, South

Hundley’s recruiting class of

15 this year is the largest in pro-
gram history.

On the men's side, seven play-
ers (Dennis Buck, Robert Clarke,
Bryce Jewett, Keith Kleeman,
Chad Lagerway, Isaac Stewart, and
Dan Guill) spent last semester
abroad, allowing many younger
players to gain valuable experi-
ence during the spring season.

. “Last spring was really im-
portant,” said junior Phil Julien.
“People like (midfielders Jeff)
Harrell and (Patrick) Cahan were
mainstays on the spring team. They
got a lot of experience.” ...

Boston University, scheduled
as Davidson’s second opponent in
the FIU Umbro Invitational in
Miami on Sept. 29, has withdrawn
from that tournament. The Wild-
cats’ alternate opponent has yet to
be determined. . .
