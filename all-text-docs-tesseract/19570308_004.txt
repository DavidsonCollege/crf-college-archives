Velma Returns

Lovis “Satchmo” Armstrong concentrates on his work while
Velma Middleton, his hefty vocalist who polled a substantial num-
ber of votes for cheerleader after her last performance here two
years ago, gives forth in a concert in Johnston Gym Wednesday

night.

Satchmo and Dixieland
Reign At Gym Concert

By GRIER DAVIS

When Louis Armstrong played last Wednesday night,
Elvis lost significance, progressive jazz seemed cold and

wan, Bach was trampled under beating feet—Dixieland

reigned supreme.

Satchmo himself said that Bach
“just didn't have that beat,” and
that progressive jazz was ‘almost
too much mustard for a dime,”
but he did think that Elvis was
a “real showman.”

Before the concert while Louis
and the boys were warming up,
they -broke into an impromptu
jam session. He coaxed his coro-
net around through its upper
register and grinned, “I ain’t as
old as I is. Oh, man! We'll give
‘em a real ball tonight.”

Lovie had been to Davidson be-
fore and he commented that he
was glad to see all the girls here
for the concert. “Eight hunnert
boys up here all alone! Why man,
that's onnatural!”

Louis Armstrong is undeniably
a showman. Standing outside the
door before the concert, he said

to Trummy Young, “We should
have marched right off the bus
aplayin'’,” and then strutted all
the way up to the stage amid the
frenzied cheering.

He blew a short run, smiled a
toothy grin and said, ‘Ah, that’s
right.” Then the sextet broke in-
to “Back Home In_ Indiana.”
Everyone seemed to enjoy it in-
cluding Louie, who laughed and
shook hands several times with
Trummy.

While Velma Middleton
shimmied. and shook in her dress
of green sequins, Louie looked on
at her in mock surprise. “What're
you doin’ there gal?”

Then ole Satch standing all
alone, let his trumpet wander over
the blue melodies from “Deep

River” to “St. Louis Blues,” the;
musie which is our very heritage. uled for vespers next fall.

At the same time the Eumanean

gram around foreign students’
views on Davidson College. Par-
ticipating were Hugo Misle, Ed
Pantigoso. Oyvind Norstrom, and
Alfred Wang. The panel generally
agreed that the Davidson student
leads a cloistered life, and he is
inclined to neglect the remaining
one-half of the world.

and particularly the clergy of the
church are now in. One is the
meeting of the Central Committee
of the WCC last August in Galya-
tetoe. Hungary. Highly propa-
gandized reports of this meeting
were released thru the Hungarian
press, and were a_ considerable
factor in sparking the idea of
revolution among the Hungarian
Protestants. The second situation
lies in the fact that the anti-Soviet
revolt was greatly instigated by
the church, the actual rebellion
having started at the Budapest
Theological Seminary.

Since the October-November re-
volt stemmed largely from the
ranks of the church, the leaders
of the Hungarian Reformed
Church are now in jeopardy from
both Hungarian and Russian gov-
ernmental authorities.

West Dorm was given the name
of “J. Archer Cannon” dormitory
Wednesday in honor of the late
Mr. Cannon of Concord.

The renaming, announced by
President John R. Cunningham,
was unanimously approved by the
Board of Trustees.

Mr. Cannon, at the time of his
death last July, was vice-president
of the Davidson College Board of
Trustees, a position he had held
for the preceding 20 years.

The dormitory was completely
renovated last summer, receiving
new flooring, ceilings, and baths.
The exterior will be refinished
this spring.

Mr. Cannon served as chairman
of the Buildings and Grounds
committee of the trustees during
the entire administration of Dr.
John R. Cunningham, which began
in 1941. During that time seven
major buildings were constructed,
the older dormitories were reno-
vated, and the grounds land-

Mr. Cannon served as president
of the Concord Rotary Club and
of the Cabarrus Country Club,

BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION |
AT IBM?"

‘Two years ago, Robert Everett asked himself this question. Today, as
Administrative Assistant to the Divisional Controller, Bob reviews his
experience at IBM and gives some pointers that may be helpful to you in
taking the first, most important step in your business career.

Who.

“What's it like to work for a big, ex-
panding company like IBM? What
would I be asked to do? Would I get
ahead fast?’’ These were some of the
questions that filled Bob Everett's
mind as he faced up to the big prob-
lem, “How can I put my M.B.A.
training to the best possible use?”

Bob came directly to IBM from
Cornell in July, 1985, with an M.B.A.
in finance. He was immediately as-
signed, with twenty-nine other
M.B.A.’s, to a Business Adminis-
tration training program. This six
months’ program comprised general
orientation in the entire IBM organi-
zation, a six weeks’ field trip to the

Why Bob picked IBM

Bob made a careful study of existing
opportunities before selecting IBM
for his career. He had a dozen campus
interviews; took nine company tours.
IBM's M.B.A. program interested .
him—because, as he says, “It gave
me a chance to review the entire
company before starting an actual
line assignment.’” He was intrigued
by the increasing use of data process-
ing equipment in finance and he knew
that IBM was a leader in this field.
Salary-wise, he found IBM better
than many, but.it was company
growth potential that motivated his
choice. “Opportunity certainly exists

alone will account for many new exec-

trend toward decentralization, which
also creates new jobs. These factors,
plus IBM’s ‘promote-from-within’
policy, add up to real opportunity.”

IBM hopes that this message will help to

Developing a new system

months at the Poughkeepsie manu-
facturing facilities. There he gained a
functional knowledge of IBM ma-
chines, particularly the 700 series of
giant electronic computers.

His training completed by January,
1956, Bob wasassigned tothe Methods
Department as a Methods Analyst at
IBM World Headquarters in New
York City. Here, with the cooperation
of operating department personnel, he
worked on the development of systems
and procedures for the various Divi-
sion areas. In addition to normal
methods techniques used in develop-
ingsystemsand procedures, hestudied
these projects in terms of possible
machine application for either IBM
high-speed giant computers or con-
ventional accounting equipment. One
project was the study of the Machine
Ordering procedure with the objective
of simplifying and mechanizing it and
at the same time improving the source
information to provide for a more
complete analysis of sales and pro-
