MINORITY, from page 13

keep the lack of minority students at Davidson in
mind when we implement this increase. We need to
.create literature addressing minorities.

I call upon the Dean of Students and his staff to

create programs toretain and aid minority students at

Davidson. One reason minority studentsare reluctant
to come to Davidson is because there is a lack of an
adequate support system. Notonly is Davidson frigid
to minority students, it is also hostile. We can learn
from other liberal-arts schools who have imple-
mented a host of programs directed at helping minor-
ity students. A support system for minority students
must be initiated by the school and.not by students.
I call upon the Dean of Academics and his staff to

recruit and retain minority faculty. Again, there is a_

pool of qualified minority professors in this Country.

To support this fact, we only need to look at two.

“Davidson minority educators, Gail Gibson and Julio

Ramirez, whoin recent years were chosen by CASE as

the best professors in North Carolina. If the atmos-

phere is receptive and warm, we will be able to attract

and retain minority professors. One short-term solu-.

tion is to bring visiting minority professors from the
area to teach ethnic-related courses. However, this is
not a long-term solution; it should not serve as a
substitute for retaining regular faculty.

I believe that one key to change is money. Unques-
tionably, it will take a considerable amount of
to recruit and retain minority students, faculty and

-administration. It will also take money to create and
implement programs to aid minority students. |

Davidson has recently made public its $150 million
endowment campaign. I call upon ouradministration
to reserve $4 or $5 million to subsidize the aforemen-

tioned programs. I callupon the Vice-President for In-

stitutional Advancement to solicit funds from the
abundance of organizations, foundations and trusts
who support and aid minority programs throughout
the nation.

___ Lastly, and most importantly, I call upon the Presi-
dent and the Board of Trustees to create a committee _

and establish a work-plan that will produce a richer
diversification of students, faculty, administrators
and courses at Davidson. If the President and the

Board is unwilling to increase the number of minori-
ties and ethnic-related courses, our efforts will prove
fruitless. We need their commitment and leadership.

Davidson needs and has thé ability to change.
Davidson has demonstrated this ability in the past.
Last decade, werecognized theneed toenroll women.
Our students, faculty, administrators and Trustees
took appropriate action: committees were created, .
studies were made and reports were produced. The ¢
Class of 1993 has an unprecedented number of
women: approximately 47 percent, or 179. With this in
mind, we now must look forward and change. We
need to increase the number of minority students,
faculty and administrators. We need more African.
Americans, Hispanics, Asians and women. We need
to have programs to aid them. We need coursesinour
curriculum that reflect the rich and unique composi-

_ tion of this country.

Finally, we need to work collectively. tr onde: to.
