November 30, 1979—The Davidsonian—9

By BERT MOBLEY
Sports Editor —
Davidson meets Wofford to
start the basketball season Sat-

Gym. The Cats have a lot of
experience returning to this
year’s squad, and they’re ready
for action. Davidson travels to
Lexington, Va., Monday night
to play VMI before playing in
-the First Union Invitational at
the Colisieum December 7-8.

The Davidson College bas-
ketball guide for 1979-80 does a
fine job of publicity when it
mentions - ‘‘Davidson’s incred-
ible climb to top 20 rank in nine

, Of the past 16 years.” The fact
that the last of those top 20
seasons came in 1969-70 is all
the more reason for even David-
son’s basketball hopefuls to
look with reserved optimism on
Coach Eddie Biedenbach’s. se-
cond season at the Wildcat
helm.

What will be success for this
year’s squad? Regardless of any
optimism, the answer will more
than likely not be another top
20 year.

Success as Coach Biedenbach
sees it is ‘doing what we do well
and doing the best we can do.”
He admits the best may not be a

winning season, but he believes
an improvement over last year’s
8-19 won-lost record is a definite
possibility.

“I'm hoping we win this
year,” he said,“‘but I'm build-
ing a whole long term program.
For lack of a better explanation,

I'll. say we're in a rebuilding
year; we're building a program
not concerned with an indivi-
dual win or record but.con-
cerned with a program to match
the great educational institu-
tion which Davidson is. Alum-
ni, faculty, administration,
students, and the athletic staff
are all a part of the program and

But the immediate success of
Davidson basketball rests on
the 14 guys on the team along
with Biedenbach -and ‘his three
assistants, Marv. Kessler, Jeff
Bzdelik, and Rick Barnes. Bz-
delik and Barnes are both in
their second years with the Cats
while Kessler is a newcomer
with impressive credentials. He
was head coach at Martin Van
Buren High School in Queens,
N.Y., with a 146-36 record.
Later, he was head coach at

Adelphi University where he.

also compiled a winning percen-
tage. He played on the college
level at N.C. State and was a

‘‘we’ve got. te play our.best
every night.”’ While thc possi-

bility of a top ranking may be

slim, the Cats have set the goal

high. That goal is winning the

ing a spot in the NCAA

regionals. Biedenbach ‘sees |
Furman, Appalachian, East .

Tennessee, and Marshall as the
most formidable opponents in
the conference.

Outside the conference, the

¢ Pennsylvania,
N.C, State, uth Carolina, and
UNC-Charlotte in the Coliseum
and Wake Forest, St. John’s,
and Notre Dame in road games.
“With our schedule,’ Bieden-
bach said, ‘‘we could win by 20
points one night and lose by 20
the next with a better effort.
We'll be underdogs in half of
our games.” ,

A tough schedule is not the
only obvious obstacle to a
winning season. John Gerdy
graduated, and with him goes
the high scorer in 21. of last
season’s games and an average
of 26.7 points per game. In
addition, Biedenbach says the
team this year will be guarded
better because the defenses
won't be keying on Gerdy; thus
the Cats will have. to shoot

better. But Biedenbach has -
more to say about this year’s
non-Gerdy team: “Each team .
has a new complexion. Obvious-
ly, we'll miss Gerdy, but with
small improvement in every
area we should be a better
basketball team.” '

He continued, ‘‘Last year,
our guys had Gerdy and. gave
up the advantage of some shots
they didn’t recognize. . We'll get
a better team effort without —
Gerdy because of our maturity
and the talent of the incoming
freshmen.”

Davidson don. return five

‘‘starters” to the squad in-
cluding sophomores. Rich DiBe-
nedetto who missed last year,
Jamie Hall, and Brian Rowan.
Todd Haynes, the _
on the team, is. back
senior Ernie Reigel. ——

Tribus and senior Rich Perky.
The next two rounding out the

“top 10” according to Bieden-
bach are sophomore Greg Ber-

son.

This io a: large edlidoe be bs
considering for starting spots,
but Bietlenbach likes the depth.
“T believe we have eight or nine
stronger players than .we had
last year,” he said. “The key
will be getting the most out of
them. and getting them to
complement each other.’’ He
feels the Cats’ objective is team
work both on offense and de-
fonee.

" DiBenedetto and Hall, slong
with Rowan and Haynes, will be
strong rebounders, and Bieden-
bach cites the team's free throw
shooting as a definite asset.

continued, “Our team-oriented

Definitely, the emphasis for
Biedenbach and ‘his ‘staff this
season will be a team effort with
many players contributing.
Biedenbach has been pleased
with the effort so far during
