THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS & LIVING

Masters have class

By WESLEY GOLDSBERRY
Staff Writer

Apart from the series of out-
standing concerts showcased as a
part of last week’s Vail Music Resi-
dency (“Masters at Davidson”),
there were several opportunities for
music students to both seek the ad-
vice of the resident virtuosos and

observe as they assisted others in ~

enhancing their musical skills.

Ten of these forums, known as
“master classes,” were held in ven-
ues across campus last week.

The term “master class” is not
an allusion to the “master” musi-
cians involved. Rather, they are
essentially music lessons held open
to the public, in which present stu-
dents may elect to perform for the

strumentalist.

Many of these classes lasted
for up to three hours, and some of
them were attended by many
community music students and
enthusiasts. Students from as far
away as Raleigh made the trip to
Love Auditorium to participate
in Thursday’s violin masterclass,
held by Kerry McDermott, con-
cert soloist and member of the
New York Philharmonic.

In addition to the two for
violin students, master classes
were also held for viola, cello,
bass, horn, oboe, clarinet, flute,
and bassoon.

The classes served an integral
part of the residency, a unique event
in Davidson’s history, giving stu-
dents a chance to meet and interact
