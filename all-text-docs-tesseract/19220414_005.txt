THE

DAVIDSONIAN,..APRIL 14, 1922.

Hard lines.
He dropped a Weighty Remark; 1t
landed on the floor and cracked.
He picked up the Drift; and it froze
his hands.
He cast an Endearing Glance; it re-
bounded and bowled him over.
He Caught his Breath, strangled it and
threw it to one side.
He Grabbed a Chance, but it hit him
and he died of infection.

If you don’t believe it, here it is in
print:

“One dozen of eskimo pies are equal to}

10 pounds of tomatoes.”—News: Item.
Since science has discovered that one
dozen eskimo pies is of equal value with
10 pounds of tomatoes, our own math-
ematical department rushes forward

with additional figures to complete the|

equation. Eight pounds of beef steak
have been proved to equal 61-4 pairs of
low shoes, if placed one upon the other.
A ton and a half of celery if packed in
old crates will equal two Davidson
Thanksgiving turkeys and a dash of
spaghetti. A gross of egg plant if
properly packed will equal one cold
storage emporium,

As’a final triumph of equivalents it
has been found if 5 pounds of sausage be
carefully rolled and kept in thermos

A chaperone is a useless functionary
which accompanies young people in

They've put on prohibition, and are do-

regulated that it will be easier to get
out of prison than to get into wedlock,
and then—some prohibition officer will
discover that the juice of an apple or
peach, if allowed to pass through a cer-

bears resemblance to the fluid given
forth by the mythical fountain of youth.
After that it will all begin over again.

A MERRY DRAMA.

In Many Acts and Numberless Scenes
By ‘Thien Shaw’ Milne.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides himself on
the nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his
private opinion. that he is a veritable
lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and a no
prominent junior; in matters of
dress, his taste is more conservative and
substantial; in regard to his love affairs
the old adage, “Still water runs deep,”
is applicable.

Act I—A FLAPPER’S CRIME,

Scene: A room, third floor Georgia,
back. -The time: 10:50 a. m.

Lennox (looking up hastily from a let-
ter that he has been reading):
|of Noah and may the Holy Pink-Toed
Prophet quail in his tracks.

Carroll (the while continues to
absorb history from a blue-bound book
of generous proportions): Your com-
|mand of the prophets would indicate that
you found Fresh Bible a crip.

L. (with agitation): Would the pa-
tience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon
were mine—Mary spills all the beans in
this.

C. (closing his book): Not the Queen’s
Mary?

L. (moodily): Even so.

who visited Davidson three weeks ago,
said:

“As I am about to leave the South for
New England, I cannot go _ without
snatching a moment to say what very

remain of my visit to Davidson. Long

siderable pride have I been able to say
in other colleges that I have visited, Da-
