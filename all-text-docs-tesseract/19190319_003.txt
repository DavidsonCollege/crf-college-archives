The subject for debate last Saturday
night was: “Resolved, “That the Peace
Conference should cheek Japanese ag-
gression in China,”

The debate was unusually good and
fall of “pep.” and all men showed some
preparation, Sume of the speakers, espe-
cially Liston, waxed eloquent at times.

The affirmative, upheld by Mctl-
waine,. McQGukin, Ormand,, A. C.. and
Liston. proved: First, “Phat it) is con
trary to the open door policy, which
means that no nation shall go in and in-
terfere with another nation... Secend.
That.it is contrars to the Peace League,
Third, ‘That every nation wants to main
tain its national integrity.

The negative. upheld by Price. J. K..
Richards, J. ML. Ratchford and Robson,
C. RB. argued: First, That as conditions
now exist China is a liability to the
world, but if Japan were allowed to go
in she would become an asset, China is
avery large and rich: country. but her
resources have nat been developed. Sec-
ond, ‘Vhat) Japan, being a highly edu-
cated and enlightened nation, is the right
nation to intervene. “UVhird. Phat Japan,
because of her rapidly increasing popu-
lation. must expand somewhere.

C. B. Sanders rendered a very inter-
esting, declamation on “he Founders of
Texas.” ‘Vhis was a very appropriate
subject and one .in which he especially
should be very interested in being a na-
tive ot ‘Texas himself. Summers ren-
dered his declamation, “A Eulagy on
Abraham Lincoln,” in a very easy and
forceful manner. Both these declama-
tions were a credit to the men.

Phi Society.

The Phi Society met Friday night.
The speakers showed a thorough know!-
edge of the subject for debate. T. C.
Stone and R. D. Hall took the afirm-
ative, while J. P. Poteat and bk. N.
Booker spoke for the negative. “The
judges decided in faver of the afirm-
ative, ‘I’, A, Alexander gave a good
oration on Junior Speaking. The sub-
ject of the extemporancous debate was:
“Resolved. “That steam is more useful
than electricity.” W. ‘T. Dunlap rep-
resented the affirmative sad won over
H.C. Hamilton, the negative contender.

PPHE NEW'WATCH

ON THE RHINE)

On Friday, the 13th, in the fifth week
ot the armistice. the troops of the Allied
armies crossed the Rhine and so entered
upan the last phase af occupation, says
The Stars and Stripes, overseas journal
ior the American Expeditionary Forces.
‘Today, the sentries who guard its bridges
and pace their posts within the shadow
gt the ancient castles are not German
soldiers. Poilus and ‘Tommies and
Yanks. these three— and it) was then
very best present to a tired, thanktul
world—these three are keeping tae
witch on the Rhine.

It was just at dawn that the close
‘massed forces uf the “Uhird American
Army moved forward in the dismal De-
cember rain té take and hold the bridge:
head that is theirs today. By — teur
bridges and four ferries, they moved
quietly across the river, which is more
beautiful’ than any eur own country can
show and which means mere to Ger
many than any American river can ever
mean to us. The Rhine, for all its cas:
tle-crowned steps, for all its massive
and impotent fortresses, is more than «
mere moat to guard the Fatherland.

Ve the Germans, it is a river of proud
memories, the silver thread on which
their History is strung, the link of Tore
and legend, the inspiration of their song:
for which through countless generation
its Hisping waters have crooned a sott ac-
companiment. And then, in the gray ot
a December morning, an American army
moved across the German Rhine.

For this great hour in the, histosy ol
the United States, many Americans were
up and abrodid an hour in advance of che
sun, though reveille meant nothiag in
their lives. Gray-hatied stati ofhicers.
Salvation Army lassies, covks from
neighboring messes, Couriers, artists, wit
correspondents, they were. all there wait
ing at the Coblenz pontoon --the Bridge
of Boats—for the electric moment wheo
the Rhine bridges should give forth the
music, the ever-recognizable,  eer-stir-
rie music of American infantry on the
march,

Yet they knew in their hearts it would
he what the French would regard as an
indifferent show. ‘They knew from long
and gloomy experience that the Amer
ican Army simply retuses to be dra
matic! “They were right. “Phere wae
no fuss and feathers, no flourish of trum
pets. Chere never is. On the stroke of
seven, the first mounted men: clattered
forward over the cobbles of the quay say:
the order ‘Forward March” sounded
from post te post alony the river front.
It was raining and there was scarcely
enough light in the heavens to rival as
yet the winking street lamps. Faint
silhouetted against the gray sky were
visible the great ramparts of Ehrenberert
stein and not far below, where the Mo-
selle swings into the Rhine, could be seen
in sharp relief the stupendous statue of
the first. Wilhelm.

This bridge~-it was at the — point
where, according to Rhineland legend,
the lovely Riza walked upon the waters
from shore to shore a thousand years age
—this bridge was set aside for the First
Srivade. It was the same brigade which,
less than a year before, had, to the in-
tense and audible amusement of the Ger-
man Army, modestly settled dawn in the
American old home sector “northwest of
Toul.”

First came Major Paul Daly, of New
York. He was on horseback and two
mounted men followed clase — behind.
Then, if history must have the prosaic
order of march, came Brigadier-General
Frank Parker and some officers of his
staff. “Then some. French officers. “hen
