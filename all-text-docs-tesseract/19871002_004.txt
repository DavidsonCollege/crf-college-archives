‘By TRIPP HELMS
Michael Toumazou

Davidson’s newest classics
professor Michael Toumazou
does not just read about ar-
chaeological data; he finds it him-
self. for the past five years
Toumazou, originally from
Famagusta, Cyprus, has partici-
pated in archaeological digs on
mainland Greece and Cyprus.

Toumazou first came to the
United States as a high school for-
eign exchange student. After
spending a required two years in
the army of Cyprus, he returned to
the U.S. and went to Franklin
Marshall College. There he com-
pleted his bachelor’s degree in
physics and classics. -

He went on to Loyola Univer- —

sity in Chicago where he got a
master’s degree in Greek. He
completed his degree work at
Bryn Mawr College with a mas-

ter’s degree in archaeology and a
doctorate in classics and archaeol-
ogy. _Toumazou married in

Pennsylvania. He and his wife
have two children by her previous
marriage — John, aged 15 and
James, aged 13 — and have a
daughter Katie, aged 60 months.
Toumazou: enjoys photography,

skin diving, fishing, and personal
computing when he is not par-
ticipating in his favorite hobby,
archaeology. He is a member of
the Greek Orthodox Church, and

has been active in scouting,
CROP, and fundraising for re-
fugees in Cyprus.

For Toumazou, life in David-
son is much.like life in Cyprus —
“slower and less hectic than in
New England.” Because he has
been a full time student for the last

to the students and looks forward
to working with them and getting

‘to know them better. In the near *
future, Toumazou hopes to takea

few interested students on a exca-
vation with him.

Nina Serebrennikov

For Davidson’s newest art
® professor Nina Serebrennikov,
“art history is an  CXCMIRG field to
be in right now” and she shares
that excitement with her students.

Serebrennikov was originally
interested in literature, not art.
She spent a year in Paris studying
French literature in 1967 and
1968. Her interest in art was first
evident when she found that she

was “spending more time in the
Louvre than in the library,” she
says.

She did not immediately begin
to study art, however. Serebren-

Serebrennikov later decided to
complete a Ph.D. in art history at
the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill. She did most of her
research in Brussels, Belgium,
where she studied the sixteenth
century artist Bruegel. “As

“drunk with words”, Bruegel is
drunk with figures, using very

Before coming to Davidson,
Serebrennikov was a professor at
Ohio State University where she
taught classes of as many as 250
students. She enjoys Davidson be-
cause “instead of teaching 250
students ina required course, I am
teaching classes of twenty-five
who are taking the course because
they are interested in learning
about art.”
