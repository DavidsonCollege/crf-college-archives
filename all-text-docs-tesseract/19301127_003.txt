backs and five linemen, all of whom have
contributed a great deal to the suctess of
the team this season.

McCall,
Thad

Fraley, quarterback; Joe
Tom Brohard, fullback;
guard; Bill Mason, center;
Hub tackle; ‘Charlie Parker,
guard, and Jim Proctor, end. The football
career of Dan Goodykoontz, also a_ senior,
was brought to an end when he was forced
out by a bad shoulder injury.

All these men will likely make their let-
ters this year, and upon their graduation
will leave the gaps which the Davidson men-
tors will have to fill in fashioning theis first
string next fall.

Captain Fraley, holder of two varsity let-
ters in football, will start his last game as
captain tomorrow. His work all season has

to a

Neither team was able to gain
through the stone-wall defense
presented by their opponents, and offensive
efforts for the afternoon were on the whole
unspectacularn, and failed to produce any
thrilling moments for the large crowd of
spectators. ,

The football managers held the better end

of the decision, especially during the last
half, when sweeping end runs featuring
Mosely, who came out of the line to carry

the ball; McLean, and others kept the ball
in Track territory most of the period. A be-
lated passing attack by the Track bosses,
featuring Sisson on the hurling end, failed
to stem the tide of the advancing Gridders
until late in the fourth period.

The only real scoring threat of the game
came late in the first quarter when Mebane,
halfback for the Football squad, leaped high
in the air to intercept a pass from Sisson
and then streaked down the sidelines until
stopped on the five-yard line by a sensational
tatkle by Sisson. (The tackle stopped Me-
bane’s efforts for the day, too.) On the next
play, however, Jones fumbled and an alert
Track forward fell on the ball to break up
the threat.

It would be unjust to name any man as
the star ofhis'team, but Mosely of the Foot-
ballers drew loud cheers from the stands by
his scintillating runs and sterling line play.
Jones’ play as safety man was likewise no-
ticeable. McLean and’ McKinnon likewise
plaved good football. For the Track Man-
agers, Sisson’s play stuck out like a red nose
on a cold day. He shone in backing up the
line and in hurling long forward passes.
Marsh looked good on the defense, also.

The trip into Virginia which Davidson
has been making heretofore
carded and several teams of South Carolina
will be played in lieu of this. Another swing
through North Carolina will make up the
other long trip of the season. Most of the
3ig Five members will be met on this trip.

The schedule as it now stands is far from
complete, with probably ten more games to
be arranged. This will give between 20 and
25 engagements in all, and will present sev-
eral new teams which were not played last
year. These include the University of South
Carolina, The Citadel, and the College of
Charleston, which will be met on the South
Carolina trip.

Only two of the Big Five have been defi-
nitely scheduled, both N. C. State and Caro-
lina to be: met once each in Charlotte and
later the road. Dates with Duke and
Wake Forest have not been decided upon
definitely at this time. Lenoir-Rhyne, Elon,

"EM OVER

With W. H. Matthews

The Wake Forest Demon Deacons,
whom Davidson would rather beat more
than any other team on its schedule ex-
cepting possibly Carolina, will furnish the
diversion for the Turkey Day fans who
jump up froma delightful feed of Turkey,
cranberry sauce, rice, potatoes, dressing,
and lots of other things, to run out to the

football field. The Wildeats have not been

able to.win from the Deacons in ten
years, and they feel that now is the time
for all good men td rise up and smear

them all over the Central High gridiron.
That, however, is a much more dif-
ficult thing to accomplish than it is to
write it down on one’s.typewriter.
The fight which Wake Forest gave
Carolina, the struggle they gave the
Blue Devils last week-end, and their
general play throughout the season
has stamped them as
strongest of the Big Five. Davidson
could well have picked a more auspi-

one of the

cious year to break a jinx which dates
back a decade.

We look for the game tomorrow to be

a harder game to win, if Davidson does
win, than was the Carolina game. We be
lieve, however, that if they put out for

fsixty minutes and fight as they did against
Carolina those last that
the Wildcats can upset this heavy, strong
Baptist team. It will take football of the
high quality the

same which upset Tar

though,

The makeup of the Wake Forest
team will make it harder for’ David-
son to handle them than even were
the Tar. Heels. Boasting a line which
averages 190 pounds from tip to tip,
200 pounds from tackle to tackle, the
Deacons have one of the most im-
posing forward walls of any team in
the state, and one which is just about
the best. At least four men of that line
are being seriously considered for All-
State berths. A pair of ends second
only to those of Duke and two tackles,
one a 230 pounder and the other
weighing 218, give a well protected
flank on both sides.

It will take everything Davidson has
to gain consistently through such a
line. They will doubtless have more
trouble doing it than they did against
Carolina. But it has been done; Temple

we honestly believe Davidson can and

Davidson's chances of victory were ma

terially enhanced by the fact that Wake

they are bound not to be in tiptop form
mentally for Davidson. Wake Forest had
heen looking to the Duke game for two
weeks; thinking about nothing — else,

Manning for nothing else, and then fight-

ing-in the game as if nothing else mat
tered after that. They cannot possibly be
in tiptop shape for the following game,

and are apt to be in the throes of a severe

let-down.
On the the Wildcats

have had ample time to prepare for

this game, and should be in as good
shape now as at any time this year.
We look for them to play just such a
game as they put up against North
Carolina, and it will take play of the
same high type they exhibited there

to win.
