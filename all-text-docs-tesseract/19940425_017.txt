Crawdads:
another
team to

follow

By Jason Byassee

Rats. Basketball is over.

It has been a couple of weeks
since Duke’s season ended on Chris
Collins’ 80-foot jumper. The Char-
lotte Hornets have just been elimi-
nated from pro basketball’s play-
offs.

Most of you will agree that the
only non-Hornet worth watching
the NBA is currently wearing a
pin-striped White Sox uniform. Oh
well. So what is there to do sports-
wise, to pass the time between now
and the NFL pre-season? Playing
basketball at Baker doesn’t seem
to be an option. It is hard enough to
get into a game in the fall, but with
both men’s and women’s teams
playing pick-up ball on spring af-
ternoons, it is now close to impos-
sible. We need more options.

Ithink I found the answer. It is
the Hickory Crawdads.

Youknow, minor league base-
ball. Ballparks that hold 4,000
people. Hot dogs that cost only a
buck. Little kids having birthday
parties and chasing foul balls. Lots
of really drunk rednecks. All the
things that make an enjoyable
evening, plus a little baseball to
boot.

Now, I am going to say that
the Crawdads play really great
baseball. They do have a pretty

decent record and a third baseman |

named Pete Rose, Jr., but the last
time I was there, there were three
errors in half an inning. One was a
dropped infield fly ball. Ouch!
Sounds more-like an IMAC soft-
ball game, huh?

There were, of course, redeem-
ing qualities. There was also a re-
ally cool mascot (imagine a life-
size crawdad), a cameo appear-
ance by the Hornets' cheerleaders,
and a brand new, relatively
crowded park. There were guys
selling popcorn and Crackerjacks
and the Crawdads’ very own fight
song during the seventh inning
stretch. This town does A- level
baseball right.

Baseball has something other
sports don’t — the fact that any-
body can experience it. The most
inexpensive bleacher seat in a ma-
jor league park is $7 at Fenway,
still $2.75 more than a Crawdads
ticket.

Baseball’s farmsystemallows
the sport to branch out to the Hicko-
ries all over America, each with a
personality all its own.

There’sevenatouch of Ameri-
can idealism in minor league base-
ball. Although most of the players
onasingle-A roster will never play
in “The Show,” they’re getting a
chance to play a few years of base-
ball and to make money doing it.
Some hard work and talent will
move you through; a bad break
will get you cut. That’s the game,
and it's good.

Men's tennis finishes second in conference

By Patrick Jopling

The men’s tennis team won
seven out of nine matches Sunday
to jump from fourth to second in
the Southern Conference. Coach
Jeff Frank, whose team has now
finished as runner-up four years in
a row, called Sunday’s perfor-
mance “an amazing effort.”

Holt Vaughan and Dan

Parham ended the tournament for
Davidson with a conference title.
They won the Number Two
doubles flight by defeating Peter
Lawrence and Kurt Swoboda, 6-3,
6-7, 6-4 in an intense, two-and-a-
half hour battle. Vaughan said,
“The freshmen stepped it up. The
victory made all the hard work
worthwhile.”

Parham was equally excited
about the victory, for he “was glad
to end on a positive note.”

In the other doubles matches,
Bill Mitchem and Chris Parker
soundly defeated the Number
Three squad from East Tennessee
State, 6-2, 6-4 to finish third in the
flight. At Number One doubles,
Russell Briggs and Ryan Harper

finished seventh in the flight by
default over an injured Western
Carolina team.

On Sunday, the singles high-
lights were numerous. Parker fin-
ished third in the Number 3 flight
by avenging a regular season loss
to Alex Zeiter of UT-Chattanooga,
7-6, 6-3. Parham also inflicted
revenge by defeating Erik deVries
of Furman, 6-4, 6-4, to finish third
in the Number 5 flight. deVries,
the #1 seed, did not lose a regular
season conference match. Dan
Grinnan took third in the Number
4 flight, defeating Zack Sharpe of
Appalachian State, 6-4, 7-5.

‘ In the Number One Singles
flight, Davidson’s top player and
the Southern Conference Player of
the Year, Russell Briggs, played
his final match. He faced Gwinyai
Tongoona of UT-Chattanooga, a
member of the Zimbabwe Davis
Cup team. Tongoona, the #3 seed,
was the only conference opponent
to defeat Briggs in the regular sea-
son, and, unfortunately for
Davidson, he was did it again on
Sunday, 6-4, 6-3. Briggs was gun-

etic had

ning for his 91st singles victory as
a Wildcat, but his brash, intimidat-
ing style of play was not enough to
knock off the quicker Tongoona.
While disappointed, Russell dis-

played class in defeat, for accord-
ing to him, “The guy deserved to
win. He just outplayed me.”The
final standings were Georgia
Southern 71, Davidson and Furman

Baseball greats
Boretti and
Freitas. will be

missed

By Matt Pitzer

When it comes to baseball,
seniors Brett Boretti and Jazz
Freitas are what you might con-
sider opposites. In the field, they
are as far from each as possible:
Boretti starts at catcher, while
Freitas roams center field.

Atthe plate, all Boretti wants
to do is hit the ball as hard as he
can. Freitas, however, tries to
reach base any way he can, en-
abling him to use his speed to
“wreck havoc” on the basepaths.

But in terms of success, the
two are similar. Earlier this sea-
son, both reached that magical
200-hit barrier previously broken
by just two Davidson players and
neither knew about it until later.

Boretti, from Beverly, Mass.,
currently ranks fourth on the team
in batting average, second in hits,
and third in both home runs and
RBI.

“He’s a guy players like to
see up with guys on base,” coach
Dick Cooke said. “He’s proven
he can be a dominant hitter in
college.”

The starting catcher since
mid-way through his freshman
year claims to have no special
philosophy about hitting. He just
“thinks about hitting the ball as
hard as I can."

Despite the success he’s had
this year and despite becoming
the third Davidson player toreach
200 hits, this season has statisti-
cally been a letdown from last
year when he hit .386 with 13
home runs and 48 RBI, and for the
team which was 14-27 entering

So long,

senior sports stars

performances on the courts, the track, and in the fields.

last weekend’s play.

“T think our record stinks,” he
said, “I think we should be better
than that. We’ ve got enough talent
to play with anyone. Sometimes
we haven’t been ready to play ev-
ery day.”

Boretti adds an important di-
mension to the team aside from his
offense and role as team captain.
Catcher is regarded as the most
vital position in the game. Boretti
has lived up to that billing so well
that Cooke has never had to call a
pitch from the bench.

The low-key, but very intense
Boretti doesn’t believe he has such
a large part of the pitching; instead
he understands his job to suggest a
pitch to the hurler.

“T think that if you like base-
ball, you were born on it and grew
up with it,” Boretti said. "It’s so
much fun, especially as a catcher
when you are in the middle of
every play. Iconsider myselflucky

“Tennis says goodbye to Hess

By Tracy French

Cyndi Hess says she doesn’t
watch much professional tennis on
television. “It’s kind of boring
now without Monica Seles, and
with Steffi [Graf] winning every-
thing, and I don’t really watch that
much television.” Hess
doesn’t have time to watch T.V.
She is too busy studying and play-
ing number one singles and num-
ber two doubles for the Davidson
women’s tennis team.

Hess, a senior religion major
from Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
started playing tennis at the age of
ten. After her high school tennis
coach suggested she look at
Davidson, Hess decided to visit.
Davidson appealed to her. “It is a
small, Southern, liberal arts col-
lege, and I liked what I knew about
the tennis program.”

Hess has played the number
one singles position since her fresh-
man year at Davidson. “I like
playing one because you get a lot

of tough matches that way.” When
asked if she felt pressure to win at
the number one position, she re-
sponded, “No, my position means
as much as every other position,
so there is no added pressure.”
She has handled the position well,
however, with an overall winning
match record every year.

Next year, Hess will work in
the business department at the
Van Der Meer tennis center in
Hilton Head, South Carolina. She
then plans to go on to graduate
school in religion. Last week,
however, she was concentrating
on her last tennis tournament as a
Davidson tennis player: the South-
ern Conference Championships.
“I’m excited—especially about
the doubles. Kimberly [Nance]
and I have had a great year, and
this is my last tournament at
Davidson.”

At this year's Southern Con-
