The Davidsonian

Library sparks

By Vijay K. Verghese
Guest Columnist

It stands in splendid glory, the
high priest of wisdom, its darkened
partats reflecting the glare of a harsh
winter’s sun, its inner secrets witheld
from mortal view. What lurks within?
Amazed at my. temerity I cautiously
push open a door and slide into the
sombre hush. The heathen in the E.
H. Little library. Bright neon lights
cast a mantle of hope on a myriad
, hapless souls that lie littered in
‘disorganized profusion, bleary eyes

perusing through closed lids, hands °

desperately clutching enormous vol-
umes perched precariously on somno-
lent laps. Transcendental education, I
think to myself as I step boldly in.

But wait--something moves in the ond

shadows. It approaches me with &
murderous intent. Is it man or boats
Forsooth, ’tis a walking bookshelf.

Avast villain thou shalt rue this day’ +

I back up to the wall in cold sweat and '
strike a heroic pose. Ahh--tis only a
young student who has overindulged
his passion for borrowing books
unable to see.over the vast stack he
has amassed in his. loving hands. He .
floats by, beatific smile on face,

blissfully unaware of a certain Indian
youth who averted fatal collision only
through his alacrity and nimble leaps.

“Could I lend you a periscope?’’ I
mutter. ‘‘WATCH THAT STEP.’’

To the Editor

(crash)..Too late. The aforementioned

~ gentleman lies on the green carpeted
floor, ribs crushed by tién black neatly
bound volumes of Biology. One
Davidson soul stuffed with the eclec-
tic nothingness of liberal Arts is off to
meet its maker.

Nothing more can be done for that
poor unfortunate; so I plod up the
stairs to browse through the news-
papers that provide ones only contact
with the outside world in this micro-
scopic bucolic town which could be
easily transported to Outer Mbgolia
without any of its gentle folk realizing
the difference in location or clime.
Sinking into a soft beckofiing arm-
chair, I laboriously unfold and spread
out what appears to be a promising
paper. ‘Julius Ceaser Invades Bri-
tain’, scream the headlines. Christ!
There must be something a little more

_ recent than this. I plough through the
dusty shelves in a frenzy, hurling
magazines and newpapers around me
in frantic desperation. ‘‘Informa-
tion’, I croak, to no one in particular,

proves fruitless and I stagger‘‘down-
* “stairs again, breathing heavily, care-
oaipuily- avoiding the mass of uncon-

scious humanity that snores on,

catvigus Ph of the shredded paper,
of eae shelv ves and desola-
Yon that bear niuté stimoriy to the

* 4 The heathen calms his hysteria. I
need to talk to someone, I think to
myself. This solitude is unbearable.
With slow measured stride, an air of
nonchalance and composed mien I
stroll over to the nearest corpse and

Policy shafts females.

Tothe Editor: —

% ‘The college administration seems
perplexed as to why some decisions
produce unanticipated student resis-
tance. (Is it just desultory youth
rebellion?) They unwittingly ask:
What formula can be employed to
avoid future confrontations? But such
a line of reasoning will not. remedy ‘the

situation -- the problem should be.»
_ long-ago-developed sentiments of

recognized as one resulting essentially
from the improper frame of reference
from which policy is interpreted, not
political miscalculation. ©

Refusing to hire a Jew and the
subtle discharging of an Atheist, the
unjustified rejection of a Russian
language course, heavily fining a
freshman girls’ hall for a harmless
lipstick and shaving cream prank,
concealing blacks from prosective
white students, and the patronizing
dictation of uniform (?) course loads
all are indicative of a flaw in basic
attitudes, and create an image incom-
patible with a purpose imbuing
enlightenment.

The archaism is revealingly dis-
played by the unchanged status of
females in admissions ‘policy: a me-
morandum slipped under my door
announced that of the proposed
admittance of 350 students for next
year, only 100 can be women. Why is
entrance to Davidson so much more
restrictive for females than males,
what’s the justification for the refusal

of a sex-blind admissions practice
based on merit, not sexual bias? The
reasons I've heard are far too weak for
justifying such a yisieiiaey aiid pos:
eture..: 5 hb:

The real: salahattets I suspect, and
I hesitate to mention it because it
constitutes such a sharp accusation
.and because it probably lies-undis-
closed at the bottom of a set of

which the policy-makers are uncon-
scious, but'this base motive is the
attitude that females do not possess

, an equal claim to an education. It was

under societal pressures and the fear
of the college becoming unattractive
to modern-day males that the Trus-
tees yielded to co-education. But once
those initial requirements were met,
no further concessions were consi-
dered, no thought to the moral
rightness of denying women the same
consideration as men.

Of course we need to arrange the
numbers to fit the physical facilities
and freshman halls should remain
single-sex. (It’s not absolutely im-
perative that all freshman co-eds be
contained in a single building.) But
determined quotas which more _accu-
rately reflect applications are neces-
sary if we are to represent our
admissions policy as somewhat fair
and equitable.

“Are you Indian?”

‘‘No, I'ma Russian secret agent

to say but instead I nod my head in
polite-confirmation.

He beams at the astounding accu- .
racy of his observation. ‘‘How come
you speak English?”

‘IT learned it on the plane’
Humour him, I think to myself. After
all, his mental horizons and world
vision have been circumscribed by the
perimeters of this: vast metropolis,

liberal Art tidbits and quickie
courses,
“Do you have holy cows in India?”
“No, we have communist buffalo’s.
A Sphistophelian gleam flickers a-

cross my eyes.

am by now like’a man possessed. I
wipe my brow with my everpresent
handkerchief and gaze in wonderment

_at the multitude lost in study,

_ The apotheosis of futile ‘enlighten-
ment and the waste of four years. No
time for simple human relationships;

_no time even to absorb and assimilate

the multitudinous information (how-
ever transient), pouring into the
benumbed minds that serve as short

, term. repositories till the next bother-

some exam. Exiguous knowledge and

‘gnawing loneliness, the siblings of a

Liberal Arts descent. z

Ah well, the people are terribly
nice, I think to myself and seek
consolation in the reassuring fact that

Davidson -is a gigantic, megalopolis, ,

all hustle, bustle and excitement.
Wiest theatres, races, avant garde
art, superlative music, cosmopolitan
culture and other interesting diver-:
sions: all available-- -within the radius ©
of seven hundred miles! Fortunate are’
we to have been so blessed by the kind
hand of fate.

All of a sudden, I am torn out of my
reverie as the door bursts open and a
shivering figure lurches in, eyes

shining with a strange brightness
that augers ill. Rushing up to him, I
enquire discreetly--‘‘Slater?’’ He
manages a feeble nod and promptly
dies in my arms. Lucretia Borgia
cheers lustily in heaven as I lower the
body of my fallen colleague to the
ground and mumble a pater noster.
The Gourmets flee, the corpses re-
main insensitive to this high drama.
‘Hello there” I shout at the top of my
voice, Mecho races through the empty
silence as a cold dampness clutches
nfy heart. I awake? The
heathen trembles. Truly tis the work
of the devil.

Splutters in rage, delivers adeft blow

to my shoulder, screams, and collap-
ses, the victim of a weak heart. The
hibernation is over. Pandora's box
lies open and Communists, Radicals,

Jews and other such sundry plagues

and nuisances spring forth to haunt
the young bewildered upper bourgeois
class minds that meditate within this
warm insulated sanctuary of splendid
seclusion. Wlexpostulations fall on
deaf ears and I am forced to beat a
hasty retreat out into the fading glow
of a winter sunset. It had to happen
sometime.

Someone walks by--‘‘But I have
promises to keep and miles to go
before I sleep, and miles to go before I

sleep...'’. ‘‘Stop that Robert’’, I
shriek, ‘‘the library is right over here;
sleep tight.”’

+ There is nothing more I can do to
ameliorate the lot of my poor fellow
men so I trudge back through the
crisp fallen leaves to my room. The
Brown &f's Burden is hard to bear.
Happy Christmas.
