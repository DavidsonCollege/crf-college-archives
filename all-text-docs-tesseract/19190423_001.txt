As “Y’” Secretary for Year 1919-’20

Has Accepted Offer Made by Students in sdents in Face of Many Other Calls. Bright|Clark Hero of Victory, Strikes Out Thirteen Men and Gets Three Hits.

Outlook for Next Year.

Listen, everybody! Davidson is to
have a real Y. M. C. A. secretary next
year! Yes, ‘tis true, and what's more,
Davidson is to have the very best Y* man
alive. In other words, Mr. R. W.
Miles, Jr., has been persuaded to re-
turn next year as student secretary. ‘The
enthusiasm and interest of the students
over this announcement has never been
equalled in the history of the college
association.

The determination of the students
to secure a secretary—and if it were hu-
manly possible, to secure Mr. Miles—
has enabled them to overcome all diff-
culties and has finally led to the accept-
ance of this position by Mr. Miles.

The history of their efforts is inter-
esting reading and gives one an insight
into the spirit and temper of the stu-
dent body. About four weeks ago at a
regular Y meeting, the question was
raised as to whether the college would
secure a secretary for next year. Several
who knew declared that the state of the
college treasury would not permit such
action at this time. ‘Well, let’s do it
ourselves,” was the reply and so a com-
mittee was appointed to look after the
matter at once. After careful figuring
and conferences with students and fac-
ulty this committee submitted the fol-
lowing: resolution to the student body

“Realizing the supreme importance of
securing a ‘Y’ secretary for the collegiate
year 1919-1920, we, the students of Da-
vidson College do hereby promise to pay
the sum of three dolars each towards
his salary, provided,

(1) That a Board of Directors be
elected to control the collection of this
money and to guarantee the remainder
of his salary.

(2) That this money not be collected

before the opening of the fall term
1919-'20.”
This resolution was unanimously

adopted, although some students thought
that the amount promised was rather
small. The next step was the election
of the Board of Directors, which now
_consists of Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, chair-
man; Coach W. M. Fetzer; Professor
Macon Reid; Mr. F. L. Jackson and
the following students: S. H. Askew,
W. B. Sullivan, L. B. Schenck, J. R.
Boulware, Jr., and the Y. president, D.
M. Chalmers. This board immediately
called Mr. Miles to this work for next
year, and in the face of such determina-
tion and spirit on the part of the students
he could not do otherwise than accept,
although a dozen churches and colleges
were clamoring for his services.

Mr. Miles is a member of the class
of 191t, but owing to a foothall acci-
dent in the spring of his senior year, was
prevented from graduating with his
class. In addition to his Y. M. C. A.
and athletic work here this spring he
has found time to complete his studies
and will receive his diploma with the
members of the class of 1919.

Dr. Martin Invites
Alumni to Commencement

To the Alumni:

The approaching commencement will

e@ an occasion of unusual interest to us,
the Alumni. Many of our number—a
large proportion in fact—have met in
various ways the acid test of war dur-
ing the recent months. So far as I know
all have done their heroic duty and many
have won distinction.
A chosen few of our number have
been called upon to make the supreme
sacrifice for the flag—for civilization—
for us and the things that we cherish,
and now are asleep with the heroes be-
neath the lilies of France.

This coming commencement, _ then,
will be peculiarly one of reunions. Those
returning from France are thinking ex-
pectantly of happy meetings with old
friends. Those of us who could not go
will lose much if we are not here to
greet the returning ones and hear the
tales they have to tell. All of us will
be privileged to join in the memorial
service in honor of those who will not
return.

It is greatly to be hoped then that as

Alumni Paragraphs

By Pres. R. M. Miller, Jr.
A college is judged largely by the loy-
alty and affection of its Alumni. Are

you loyal ?

Davidson has given to the world men
of the highest type, who have been sin-
gularly successful in their chosen sphere

of work.

Davidson Alumni have carried into
life and put into practice the principles
instilled into them during their college
days. :

In 1919 it is Woodrow Wilson, Pres-
ident of the United States; in 1874 it
was Tommy Wilson—-one of the David-
son “boys.” His habitation now is the
White House; then it was Chambers
building, first floor, north wing.

One of the foremost, if indeed, not
the foremost, gifted and eloquent theo-

In the prettiest game of ball pulled off
this season Davidson applied the white-
wash to the fast Virginia team on Wearn
field ‘Vhursday afternoon, ‘he old dope
was completely spilled, the Wildcats
vutelassing their opponents in every de-
partment, “Phere were owe big reasons
tor the one-sided score, the main one
being Rufus Clark and the other the hit-
ting and all round good playing of the
whole aggregation, “Railroad was the
outstanding hero of the victory. He kept
the batters at his merey at all times and
seldom even had to work out of a pinch.
Not only was he the mainstay’ on the
defense, but he also got three out of
the seven hits obtained, cach one bring-
ing across aorun, “The whole squad was
hitting: better than ever before and in
only one inning failed to get a man on
first. With the exception of two slight
bobbles the fielding was also perfect.

The fact that the score was 5 to o does
not mean that Virginia had an off-day.
They presented an excellent infield,
Kavk especially holding down the third

tiring the locals with a total of eleven .
men left on bases.
