Fraternities Question Spencer _.

By GRAY. WILSON
Asst..Managing Editor

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. met with a
group of fraternity represtnt-
atives and freshmen senators
at his home Monday after
noon to hear complaints and
to answer questions about
the recent trustee decision
to abolish selective fraterni-
ties on campus.

The meeting was set in
response to a Saturday after-
noon pre-game demonstration
on the football field by frater-
nity men and their dates.

Jim Cantrell,’ spokesman
for the group, began the dis-
cussion with objections to
the vagueness of the second,
paragraph of the trustee re-
port which cites ‘‘changing
economic. condition’ and
“changing student attitudes”
as a basis for the recent de-
cision.

Spencer responded that the
reference to economic con-
ditions meant the deficits in
five of the fraternities, which
did not exist five years ago.
He said this did not refer
to the overall debt of Patter-
son Court.

He explained “changing
Student attitudes” as » grow-
ing dillusionment with ritual
and dying loyalty to the na-
tional fraternity, but several
students answered that the
phrase implied. a change
from pro- to anti- farternity
feeling on campus.

Spencer followed these re-
marks by stating:.’’The prin-
ciple of exclusion was the
nub of the change.”

He mentioned that’ com-
ments made ‘as early as 1918
by Walter L. Lingle and re-
ports from the Blue Sky Com-
mittee, Social Patterns Ad-
visory Commission, and the
AED -opposed exclusion as
the number one problem.

Cantrell and others propos-
ed a compromise in the form
of a 6-46 or 4-8 split of the
court into fraternities and
eating clubs, but Spencer
posed a question ratsed at a
recent IFC meeting: ‘How
do you decide who goes and
who stays? If you fiave a
half-and-half system the ex-
clusive half will look more
desirable to: students. You
stilt have the ‘ins’ and ‘outs’
of fhe problem.” —

Discussion then centered
around the general attitude
at the meeting of the trustees,
and David Weaver comment-
ed: “Our main objection is
that the student body as a.
whole was not récognized.”

John Bollinger added: ‘You

misled us into thinking that ~

this was a matter of prin-
‘ciple, but the Trustees’ ‘action

‘was very specific.”

He men-
tioned the explicit instruc-
tions on off campus dining.

Spencer replied that these
particular provisions
not by him but by another
trustee, '

Spencer then asked what
the group thought the differ-
ences between the old and
new systems would be, and
Cantrell answered that ‘some
houses are’ inevitably going
to have a reputation zs be-
ing better than others, and
students will want to go to
them.”

Spencer said: “You would
still be able to have a close
group of friends as you do
now, but under. the new sy-
stem no one would be hurt.”
He added that the important
thing about the new system
is that the student chooses,
not the group. He offered the
possibility of swapping. among
fraternities.

Cantrell asked what sort
of showing of student opinion
might. affect Spencer and the

tional institutions. Bevan an-

plementing the changes.

left the task of © selecting
their representatives. up to
the fraternity presidents

‘We'll have to .move on

from here,” said Bevan.
“There are a lot of rather
difficult problems but we
plan to direct our attention

at these;

“T recognize
few fraternities that want to
make the transition but are
afraid of financial collapse

there are a:

-before the transition is ef-
fected. I hope we can deal
with this problem.

“This is a tremendous op-
portunity for (Davidson to
lead in a new type of social
affiliation. We want to ap-
proach it with that kind of
attitude.

“Tt is now up to the fra-
lernities to decide whether
they will aceept it or not.”

Celebration Hits Campus

AN ANALYSIS
By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

White-faced clowns wand-
ered in and out of the dark-
ness among the crowd of 100
or more, whispering, exhort-
ing, clapping, drumming up
enthusiasm and excitement.

Loud, pulsating and _per-
meating jazz-rock from the
musical trio in the center of

the room poured over and

under ‘and through the throng.

Date Housing Adequate

According to Housing Di-

rector Scotty Nicholls, there .

was no shortage of places for
dates to stay during” Home-
coming last week.

In. fact, ther¢ were empty
bed in several places,” Mrs.
Nieholls noted. “‘I really can’t

be grateful. enough to the °

faculty members who went
out of their way. to make this
work. They were ty co-

operative.”
Mrs. Nicholls said that she

did not anticipate as big a
problem for Midwinters and
Spring Frolics since the num-
ber of dates for those week-
ends does not match that of
Homecoming.

“For .every person on the
regular list there is probably
one more in town who takes
in dates,” Mrs. Nichols said.
“They prefer to give the
places to students they know
rather than be bothered by
calls,

“IT. will say that there ‘were
some very disgruntled people
in town, people who had
dates fail to show up after
they had made preparations.
How the students perform be-
tween now and Midwinters,
how they handle the people
in town, will tell the tale.”

Mrs, Nicholls indicated that
there were very few, people
except new faculty members
who housed student dates for
the first time.

On eee,

It was a religious orgy, an
ecclesiastical cataclysm of
emotions, an experience rare
at Davidson.

It was called. a ‘‘celébra

Howard Hanger Trio, leaders
in the “revolution in  wor-
shin” in religion today.

Wardlaw, professor of hom-
iletics (preaching and com-
munication) at Columbia
Theological Seminary, is the
church’s answer to P. TT.
Barnum and Ed Sullivan, an
expert at attracting atten-

In preparation for his
“celebration,” Wardlaw spoké
Tuesday morning on the re-
volution in worship. He em-
phasized the. “rebirth of
wonder” in our culture and
in religion.

Wardlaw said that an ex-
perience is worshipful ‘only
as long as it is: meaningful
to the participants.”

The clown figure played an
important role in Wardlaw’s
talk. ‘The clown is the best
prototype of this celebration
worship, a mixture of de-
light and despair that is life.”

Wardlaw attempted to put
all this. together in the
celebration service that night,

slides, contemporary musi-
