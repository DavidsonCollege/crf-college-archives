To the Trustees

Davidson must not enlarge its student
body at the present*time. The question of
enrollment involves three primary factors
—facilities, standards. and qualified opin-
ion. If these factors are ignored, it will be
to the detriment and gradual deteriora-
tion of the prestige, quality, and life of
Davidson College.

In our present circumstances, we do
not have the facilities to adequately house,
teach, or handle an increase of some 150
students. A greater enrollment would im-
pose the following conditions on all con-
cerned. First, available dormitory space
can only manage 850 students with the
proposed destruction of Georgia dorm.
More students would necessitate three to
a room. Second. the ratio of students to
faculty would be greatly enlarged. Aver-
age classes would rise to around 37 in
place of around 23 which is the normal
size now. The benefits sought by many
such as more seminar type courses, smal-
ler classes, enlarged curriculum. and gen-
eral courses for the layman would be im-
possible and forgotten. In fact, the aims
for which they stand and the principles
which they espouse would be destroyed.

Third, increased enrollment would
necessitate more instructors and make
unanswerable demands on certain class-
room facilities. It would abandon any
raise in faculty. salaries, a step which is
long overdue, both in regard to attracting
top flight professors as well as to retain-
ing the present ones. Fourth. there would
not be adequate seating in chapel or Ves-
pers. particularly the latter. It is incon-
ceivable that these services would be
dropped or their buildings enlarged. Fifth,
the library, already deplorably low in
comparative standards and capacity, would
be dwarfed by the figures of a larger en-
roliment. And sixth, other aspects of cam-
pus life would feel the pressure of
cramped conditions, especially fraternity
houses, some ‘boarding houses, and the
gymnasium. So much for facilities.

All of the above factors would affect
the quatity of student and calibre of man
to graduate from Davidson. Granted that
we owe to society a greater measure of
graduates; but we have a still greater and
peculiar challenge to produce a man of
high quality, characterized by educational
and spiritual maturity and promising abili-
ty for Christian leadership. Not only would
the standards of the Davidson graduate be
lessened by quantitative measures. but
the quality of Davidson as an academic
institution would noticeably decrease on
all standards by which colleges are rated
today. We are not interested in, maintain-
ing present standards but in reaching
higher educational levels—progress. not
Stagnation or mediocrity. It is not conceiv-
able shat those closely associated with
Davidson, its past and present, would
want it to commit academic suicide in the
future.

Finally, the element of qualified opin-
ion must be considered as a strong de-
termining factor in this question. In the
recent vote of the student body, 56.5%
expressed a desire to remain the same in
size, while only 33.5% wished to enlarge.
This is a clear cut majority of over half
of the student body. It was evident in
analysis that those for the status quo were
decidedly more emphatic in their opinions
than those in favor of a bountiful in-
crease. Also in conversation and contact
with members of the faculty, it has been
revealed that many of Davidson’s out-
Standing professors, both in regard to
longevity as well as high educational po-
sition, are in strong favor of retaining the
same enrollment. Several prominent and
respected members of the administration
are of the same opinion. Certainly these
vital elements of the college—students,
faculty, and administration — who are
closer to the actual life and situation than

any other groups, are best qualified to
express the correct position for Davidson
today.

Therefore, on the basis of present fa-
cilities, quality, and opinion Davidson can
not and must not enlarge at the present
time.

Should Davidson enlarge its enroll-
ment toward 1,000 in the future? Yes—
but with an emphatic IF. Only if the fa-
cilities can be adequately enlarged to ac-
commodate larger numbers, only if the
quality of the present can be met and
enhanced. and only if contemporary de-
ficiencies can be corrected. To accomplish
this in financial terms would require an
increase of $1,800,000 in endowment ac-
cording to figures just released from the
treasurer's office. To accomplish this in
educational terms will require much fore-
thought, planning, and careful considera-
tion of all the conditions involved.

It is true that Davidson has a direct
and challenging obligation to the greatly
rising tide of those seeking admission to
colleges today. It is true that we can meet
this obligation without serious loss to the
atmospheric elements of a small liberal
arts college. It is further true that an in-
creased enrollment, if adequately pub-
licized bevond the limits of our present
territorial expansion. could attract men
who will add ‘variety, depth. and educa-
tional stimulants to a student body often
deplorable in stereotyped homogeneity.

But the benefits and demands of a
larger enrollment should not and must
not come without first meeting the pre-
requisites. The problem is one of time and
quality. Enlargement must come on a
gradual basis and only after present con-
ditions have been satisfied and surpassed.
We should be concerned now with en-
hancing the quality and calibre of David-
son and adequately filling the deficient
gaps in our educational. physical, and fi-
nancial situation. We should also make
careful plans for future consideration of
an enlarged enrollment—to accept the
challenge of educating more men in the
Christian traditions for a better tomorrow.
To enlarge in the present, however, can
only mean crowded conditions, lowered
standards, decreased quality, and an un-
healthy atmosphere pervading the whole.

The question rests with the trustees.
They are urged to consider wisely—for
the future of Davidson weighs heavily in
the balance.

Layman’s Lament

In a letter to the editor last week a
physics major expressed the strong need
for an enlarged curriculum and increased
intensity of present courses within the
Physies department. This is one side to a
propdésal we have advocated before.

The other side would be a greater
science course for the layman. Under this
system, a student could chose from biolo-
gy, chemistry, or physics for his first
semester; second semester would be de-
voted to the history and philosophy of
science. A science major would take a dif-
ferent course. one geared to meet the
advanced requirements of his particular
field of study. Another suggestion along
this same line would be to take the pres-
ent courses as now offered, strip them of
unnecessary detail and intellectual tech-
nicality, and present them with emphasis
upon instruction and application of the.
scientific method and with special atten-
tion on modern developments. This need
not be a crip course nor one that is too
general: but suffused with practicality
and new methods, it can hold great prom-
ise for the layman.

This course has been initiated with
success at such institutions as FSU, Michi-
gan State, Washington and Jefferson, and
Chatham College in Pennsylvania.

The layman wants and needs science
in his educational background — but
science that is modern, understandable,
and stimulatingly useful.

AS TRUSTEES MEET

Campus Leaders Speak as Enrollment Debate Roars

Prospects of astronomical increases in the American college popu-
lation in the immediate future have brought forcibly home the question
of what role Davidson is to play. This week the Davidsonian presents 6
cross-section of opinion from student teaders on this pressing problem.

BLAKE BRINKERHOFF: I am
by no means a staunch apostle of
change. Nor do I believe that tra-
dition, simply for the sake of tra-
dition, is good. However, weighing
in the balance as many facts as I
can obtain, both pro and con, [
feel that the increased demands
should be met and our enrollment
raised to 1000. Of course this could
be done logically only when the
financial need is met and the
increased. number of students ade-
quately handled. I personally do
not believe we would be sacrificing
quality for quantity; yet reconize
the fact that many people have dif-
ferent interpretations for the word,
“quality.”

JASON McMANUS: I am in favor
of an enrollment of 1000. David-
son with 150 more men than she
has now would not differ sub-
stantially in the “intangibles” I
think, and Davidson must expand
with the college. population. [
would like to ‘see the expansion

of student—more non-Protestants,
Ton-upper to middle class economi-
cally, more non-Anglo-Saxon. Part
of education is environment, part
is curriculum. Our environment is
stereotyped, homogenized. With
more students there will be at least
the possibility of a broader repre-
sentation in type, and more stu-
dents will lessen the pressure to
conformity.

BUNNY PERKINSON: It is gen-
erally accepted that Davidson has
a great deal to offer both as an ed-
ucational institution and as a way
of life. If the physical plant can
accomodate 1000 men, as stated
in the editorial page of this paper
last week, it seems unfortunate
that as many men as possible are
not benefiting from what David-
son has to offer. I hardly think an
increase of approximately 150 in
the student body would destroy the
small school atmosphere.

significant contribution Davidson
can make to society will come

Freedom of the Press?

By PAT MILLER

We who are members of an
academic community would do
well to take note of what is going
on at our sister institutions. The
University of North Carolina is
involved in a situation that is
appalling to many minds that have
always regarded the university as
the citadel of free thought through-
out the world. Now, however, we
witness the attempted restriction
and denial of one of the basic
human rights and freedoms. It is
a situation that challenges all who
believe in a democratic society
and way of life to cry out at the
injustice that is inherent in these
attempts at restriction.

The Daily Tar Heel, which
is the official student publi-
cation at UNC, is regarded by
many as one of the best uni-
versity newspapers. It has
often presented the most con-
cise picture of the news on the
campus, in the state, in the
nation, and in the world. While
its coverage has sometimes
been inadequate, The Daily
Tar Heel is to be congratulated
on its attempts. The present
editors of the newspaper are
two of the best in a long line.
Both Lovis Kraar and Ed
Voder are top students, the
latter being a Rhodes Scholar.

AGREEMENT IS DULL

Their editorial outlook has been
stimulating and challenging. Very
few may agree with all their opin-
ions, but their views have been
carefully thought out and given
with conviction. Their editorial
policy is correct, and they should
have the right to present their
opinions without limitation. Before
last spring's elections Kraar and
Yoder stated what their editorial
policy would be and were elected
on this as part of their platform:
“While the news pages and letters-
to the editors column are designed
to reflect student opinion, we do
not believe that the editorial col-
umns should necessarily mirror the
prevailing opinions on the campus.
Constant agreement is dull. We
will attempt to put out a news-

paper which will stimulate opin-
ion, challenge unjust prejudices. .”
(The Daily Tar Heel, Feb. 2, 1956).
. Believing in freedom of the press,
the editors have carried out this
policy and provided one of the
few powerful liberal influences on
the campus.

Because of this stand the
editors now face a recall elec-
tion and potential defeat in
what looks to an outsider like
complete absurdity. Upon the
announcement of the hiring of
Jim Tatum as football coach,
the editors spoke out against
this as the introduction of pro-
fessionalism to the campus.
Whether one agrees at ail
with this viewpoint, one
should not deny them the
right to express it.

RECALL PETITION,

Yet a strong and large faction
has arisen on the campus of UNC
that would deny the editors this
right. Headed by E. L. “Junior”
Nance of Charlotte, a petition was
drawn up asking for the recall
of the editors. Approximately 700
names were on this petition. The
school constitution requires only
10% of the student body in order
to hold a recall election. Conse-
quently on February 14 a new
election for the job of editor
will be held.

Nance, as leader of the opposi-
tion, says that the petition was
not drawn up solely because of the
Tatum editorial, but because of
the paper, He maintains that be-
cause the paper is financially sup-
ported by the students and that
the editors are elected by the stu-
donts the students should have
their views represented in the edi-
torial policy.

It is strange to me how a large
university such as UNC could be
so conservative. One would ima-
gine that the University would
reflect the liberal imagination and
feeling not only in the academic
realm, but elsewhere. It is a great
shame that free thought and liber-
alism face strangulation in a dem-
ocratic university.

through raising its standards to an
optimum level, becoming a truly
superior institution, and turning
out a truly well-educated man. The
admission of additional students
can only hinder this development.
Davidson can reach its potential
only if it admits as many students
as possible without any lowering
of the standards. Neither the facil-
ities nor the endowment are ade-
quate for an increase.

Much of what is best about
Davidson can be lost if her size is
increased. A Davidson education is
unique because it allows for in-
dividual guidance, a friendly dem-
ocratic atmosphere and rapport
found in student-faculty relations.

PAT WOODWARD: In view of
all the factors involved, I feel that
the best course for Davidson in the
near future would be that of in-
creasing her enrollment to 1000.
There are adequate, and unused,
facilites for the handling of these
few extra students, and this in-
crease could be made without turn-
ing Davidson into a “big” college.
The enrollment would not neces-
sarily have to increase over that
number. Although this would cer-
tainly not relieve the problem of
increased applications, it should
lead to an even better small col-
lege atmosphere than that existing
at the present.

PERRIN ANDERSON: I am at
present in favor of maintaining the
present enrollment policy of the
college. There are several consid-
erations which lead me to this
decision. Among these is the fact
that some of the small campus
atmosphere and benefits would be
lost if the enrollment were expand-
ed. In addition it would take an
enormous amount of money to
offer to an increased number of
students the type of education that
now is available.

I feel that our first objective
ought to be improvement of pre-
sent standards and facilities. If this
can be accomplished to a_ satis-
factory degree then the question
for increased enrollment can be
reopened.

JOHN CHILD: Recognizing the
increasing number of qualified stu-
dents who will be seeking enroll-

ment in Davidson during the next
five years, and the fact that a
group of management engineers
report that with our physical fa-
cilities we could adequately handle
1000 students—I am still of the
opinion that our role might best
be played by maintaining enroll-
ment with 850 as a very maximum.
There does seem to me to be an
obligation to the economy, so-to-
speak, but I wonder if this could
not be met by even going the
other way, which in all probability
would necessitate a raising of our
requirements and standards.

JOE BILLY PHARR: Of the two
positions defined in the Davidson-
ian of February 5, I would def-
initely favor increased enroliment
to 1000 students. This position is
based upon several factors: (1)
Economic feasibility of enrotiment
of 1000 students without too great

ODK STAND
ON ENROLLMENT

BE IT RESOLVED BY OMICRON
DELTA KAPPA: that it is our con-
sidered feeling that any considera-
tion of an increase in enrollment
be postponed until the facilities,
faculty, and endowment are avail-
able to maintain and improve the
quality of the type of education
that Davidson represents.

In no case should quality be
sacrificed .to quantity because of
alumni, church, or population pres-
sures.

We feel the pressing issue now
is improvement of the present edu-
cational process, by such means as
enlarging the library, increasing
faculty salaries, ete. Then what is
involved in an increase in enroll-
ment may be considered
i
a loss in “intangible values of a
small college” (2) An “obligation”
to meet educational needs of the
time (3) Belief that Davidson misses
a number of outstanding students
who apply because of its small en-
rollment (4) Confidence of in-
creased. endowment to keep the
present average per student and
even increase this average be-
cause of industry's realization that

our nation's colleges and univer.
sities furnish it most of it’s. exe-
cutives, managers, etc. I however
do not favor a continuous _in-
crease of enrollment.

ROSS SMYTH: It is my opinion
that Davidson should increase its
enrollment to approximately 1000
students for the following reasons

Davidson, as an institution of
learning, and especially as a
Christian institution, has an obli-
gation to boys who want a college
education and who can meet David-
son's requirements. It would be en-

tirely possible to iticrease the pre--

sent enrollment by some 150 stu-
dents and still maintain the pre-
sent caliber of Davidson men.

I do not feel that this inérease
would seriously affect the “small
college atmosphere” which is in-
deed an integral part of Davidson.

STUART VAUGHN: I think that
the Davidson College enrollment
should be increased to approxi-
mately 1000 studenta There are
several reasons why I hold this
Opinion. With so many boys apply-
ing for entrance to Davidson, there
are many good boys who are not
accepted because of the limit
placed on the number of freshmen
who can be accepted each year. If
the limit were set at 1000 students,
Davidson men would still have the
benefits of a small college, but
would also have these other boys
who are not able to enter now, be-
cause of the limit.

DEE HELM: Davidson has long
been acknowledged as a leader in
academic circles. To maintain this
position of respect, the college
must expand its enrollment in
order to help relieve the problem
caused by an overall increase in
college attendance.

Nevertheless, before the college
takes this inevitable step it must
not only assure that’ its academic
standing does not suffer, but
should also provide more adequate
facilities for its current enroll-
ment. Specifically, our library de-
mands improvement. This one
necessity has retarded our progress
for over a decade, and should be
the immediate concern of the
Trustees.

A THING OF
BEAUTY...

Dear Editor:

The recent fixtures to the land-
scape at the north end of Chambers
have given me a wonderful idea.

Why doesn’t the college put
fences around all the plots on the
campus? Really, it would add so
much, and also it would keep the
grass nice. Of course, it must be
realized that this undertaking
would be somewhat expensive, and
thus the project might have to be
started with only beautiful white
stakes like those near the Union,
but in time perhaps a rich alum-
nus would become so interested in
the work he would finance its com-
pletion in the proper manner. In
the meantime the funds devoted to
the upkeep of the grounds should
be centered on the task at hand
since otherwise the campus looks
almost perfect (what with the at-
tractive lamp posts, telephone
poles, etc.). Also it must be noted
that cable is to be preferred over
wire, though the introduction of
the former might have to be post-
poned for a while. Such as that
may be, all efforts should be made
to go ahead with the idea because
it would effect a disciplined at-
mosphere such as that needed at
Davidson.

{ believe the general con-
sensus of the students has al-
ways been that the wide ex-
panse of ground, especially on
the front campus, needed to
be artistically broken by some-
thing like galvanized pipes.
The college is certainly ed-

vancing, and its progress is
clearly reflected in this recent
development.

BOB JONES

BEST SINCE 1954?

Dear Editor,

I'd like to make a few comments
about your learned music critic’s
article last week. It was stated that
Mr. David Bar-Illan’s recital was
the best since Isaac Stern’s in
1954. The critic must have had in
mind the view that sound is only
sound when interpreted by a sen-
sible receptor, e. g. if a tree falls
in the forest it really doesn’t make
a sound unless the vibrations
find understanding ears.

So when the Budapest String
Quartet and Blanche Thebom gave
their recitals, those vibrations only
echoed back and forth against the
dead wood of those who were not
so fortunate as to be in Paris.

What is en ‘authentic musi-
cal artist’? A foreigner who
can discuss Kant at the Con-
noisseur? | guess that was the
trouble with Bob Merrill, the
kid from the States who tried
out with the Brooklyn Dodgers
the same year he auditioned
for the Met, and who probably
can’t even pronounce Dostoev-
ski’s name, much less know
what he wrote.

The review of his recital came
as a big surprise to me. I was out
of town that week-end, but mem-
bers of the music department and
voice students said he gave a
splendid performance. We'll be
looking with interest for the N. C.
Little Symphony Concert review.

Community Work and. Scouting.
Through these posts, the young
people of the Negro and White
communities have participated in
athletic events, scouting, discus-
sions of their vocation and how
they could be made Christian voca-
tions. There has been an added
emphasis on the spiritual life of

‘these young people.

DEPUTATIONS

Weekly, men have gone to
various schools and churches
on deputations and taught Sun-
day School at the sanitorium.
The Social Committee has
sponsored exchange days and
parties on dance weekends.

There has been a real attempt to
encourage study groups by the
Commission Chairman. These com-
missions have been responsible for
bringing such men as Seward Hilt-
ner and Nicholas Goncharoff to
the campus.

Approximately 200 men are en-
gaged in

active’work, but it would seem to
us that the “Y” should be more
than an organization to keep so
many people engaged in busy
work,

PRIMARY FUNCTION

Work is a result of faith in the
Person of Jesus Christ. The pri-
mary function of the “Y” on the
Davidson Campus is to stimulate
the latent spiritual energy on this
campus and to stimulate the de-
sire for a greater commitment to
God. If the “Y” fails to do that, it
has failed in its task, even if it has
850 people working.

The “Y” fails if the claims of
Christ on our corporate and indi-
vidual lives do not shake our spirit-
ual complacency and stimulate us
to fulfill our Christian destiny to
glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
You, the general membership, fail
if you do not demand that we make
a spiritual impact on your life and
suggest to us ways in which we
can fulfill our obligation as a part
of the Church and servants of
Jesus Christ!
