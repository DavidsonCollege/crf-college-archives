“The Barber of Seville.”

wonderful week for music

” As the end of the term draws near, the weeks seem to get busier than the
weekends. This week is no exception, but hopefully there will be enough time for
your to take advantage of some of the non-study activities to ease your mind.

Two music-oriented acts will be featured this week. The first is The-Barber of
Seville, presented by the New York City Opera Theatre, as the first Artist Series
performance of the year on October 31.

The New York City Opera Theatre is a touring group, founded in 1944 to bring
opera to students.

Its version of The Barber of Seville is in English and promises to be quite
amusing. (And hopefully quite popular—William Brown proudly announced
that all but 50 seats in Love Auditorium have been sold forthe series.) —

Second on.the musical agenda is the folk duo of Meisberg-and Walters. They
will perform at the Tuesday night worship service (which, incidentally, will-be
held in the 900 Room this week) and possibly ithe 900 Room after the Opera.

They will also play on Wednesday and Thursday in the 900 Room at-9: of find
11:00. They are well worth taking a study break for!

| parents, pumpkins and more

MEISHURG AND Walters wil perfor on compas Toswday, Wednesday and |
Thursday. Take @ bresk snd hear some good folk music.

I refuse to print the entire schedule for Parents’ Weekend. It’s in the
announcement sheet, on posters and in brochures. But I will mention a few of
the more interesting and pertinent events and also a few changes that have been
made.

The main item of general interest on Feiday is the 9:00 performance of
Windfall in the 900'Room. Windfall is a student group and they will also perform
Saturday night.

For those whose parents are coming, the President’s "Picnic Lunch on
Saturday has been moved to Richardson Plaza (in front of the: ’braire) and it will
feature entertainment by the Jazz Band and 1894. .” '

Other changes: the matinee performance of The Miser has been Wee to 2: 30,
and the basketball scrimmage will be in Charlotte at 5:00, °

That's it for Parents’ Weekend —now for the week’s other noteworthy event,
namely Halloween.

Return of the Vampire will be shown in Belk Quad at. 12:30 Suthrday
night/Sunday morning to kick off the freaky festivities. Nothing spooky
happens on Sunday, but Monday brings several Halloween oriented events.

At'8:00 pm on WBTV, the classic It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown will
be shown, hopefully on the big screen. Also at 8:00 that night, ET€ sponsors a
costume dance, with music by ‘“‘The Dynamic Upsetters.’ ‘Beer too, of course.
At 10:00 there will be a Halloween poetry. reading in the 900 Room. '

ie Last anddefinite!y least, we come to the big day itself: October 31st. In typical

Davidson tradition, there are (as of press time) no Halloween ‘activities taking
place om Halloween. Maybe next year!
