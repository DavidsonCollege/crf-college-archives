Cats Snap ‘Streak With 8-1 Net Win

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

The Davidson tennis team
snapped a two-match losing
streak Wednesday afternoon
with a close 6-5 win over the
squad from Harvard.

Bill Allen led the Cats by
winning the number one
singles position, 6-1, 6-4. There
were seven singles matches,

making for the large final

"Head coach Jeff Frank
praised Allen for his efforts
saying, ‘Bill has really been
playing well lately. When he
gets beat, it is not due to his
poor performance. It is
because his opponent is just
playing superb tennis.’’

The Cats had lost to both
South Carolina and Duke by

along with four doubles games

TIME OUT

with
MARK WILENSKY

We have new head football and basketball
coaches. Jeff Frank has been here not quite two
ears. Chip Stone coached Davidson soccer for the
irst time last season. Where have the Fogleman’s,
the Smith’s and the Driesell’s gone? In the last two
years Davidson has lost its head coaches in foot-
ball, basketball, tennis and soccer. At the same
time, the Wildcats are experiencing a change in
Athletic Directors, with Thom Cartmill replacing
Tom Scott.

Athletic schedules are made up years in ad-
vance. Because they are, Davidson may now be
over-scheduled. When Harry Fogleman was collec-
ting Southern Conference tennis championships the
level of our competition was increased. Now, before
Jeff Frank has had any reasonable amount of time
to develop a tennis program of his own, he is faced
with a schedule so murderous that beaking even
looks to be a realistic goal The same is true of Bo
Brickels in basketball. Bo wasn’t just kidding
when he said that he could ’t guarantee he'd still be
happy next winter. His schedule is a killer, and
unless he gets that elusive big man, Bo stands to be
hard pressed to remain afloat.

What needs to be done? Perhaps a re-evaluation
of Davidson’s athletic policy. It took four long
years and the sacrificing of a head coach, but

avidson finally realized that playing East
Carolina and Air Force in football was an exercise
in futility. Ed Farrell is here and is perhaps the
only céach of the four big sports playing reasonable
a schedule. The foot program is on the way up.
While down scheduling worked in football, it is not
the answer in basketball. Recruiting is. Basketball
is king and here and with money combined with
Brickels’ personality, perhaps the Cats get the
people needed to continue as a top team.

Perhaps.

Tennis players used to flock here to play for
Fogleman. Until Frank gets a chance to develop a
program, they will go elsewhere. It’s rare that the
Cats play a tennis or soccer team that doesn’t have
players on scholarship. The teams Davidson plays
are increasing their scholarships each year. How
much longer can the Wildcats count on getting
enough ‘‘walk on’’ — to compete? I think the

season records lately show that the luck is about to
run out. Davidson has got to su oe

oe or they’1l go the same way as
it was necessary to downschedule. That
can be avoided in the cases of tennis and soccer.
The ball is now in Cartmill’s court. It’s obvious
that our Athletic program is not what it once was.
In what sport can you be sure that Davidson has the
best team in even the Southern Conference? David-

players should not have to pay their own ways to
England. Tennis scholarships are needed. A pro-
rap wager be gt oratory» wr pd
to do so. Driesell, Smith, Fogleman and Hollandare
gone. Let’s give Farrell, Frank, Stone and Brickels
eS ‘a entive: ‘And ona

identical scores of 8-1. In both
matches, the Cats scratched
only in the first doubles slot
with Allen teaming with Rick
Quinby for the wins.

“‘We are veally getting some
great results from Rick and
Bill at the top doubles,’’ com-
mented Frank. ‘“‘Now they
have wins against State, South
Carolina, and Duke. That is a
pretty impressive record for

anyone.’

Frank also had high regards
for the number one player
from Duke, Mark Meyers.

“He is the classiest player
we will see all year,’’ Frank
said. ‘‘He just plays super ten-
nis.’’ Meyers is the defending
champion in the Atlantic
Coast conference.

One of the other key players
in the Harvard victory was
Gary Bressler, a senior who
plays in the number three
singles position. Bressler took
arelatively easy 6-0, 6-4 win.

Frank also expressed his

‘eling that Bressler was

aying very well for the Cats.

Steve Holman took the vic-

ry at the fifth singles slot.
His win came by a score of 6-1,
644.

John Hutchens rounded out
the Cat victories in the singles
competition by taking a 6-2, 6-2
win at the newly invented
seventh singles.

The doubles were split with
the Davidson duos winning the
top two seedings. Allen and
Quinby teamed together to
gain the edge in the number
one singles by a score of 8-5 in
a professional doubles set.

The pro set is designed to
save time by limiting play to
usually one set, playing that
section to eight games for a
minimum winning number.

Bressler then teamed with
Jim Dorsett to take the top
spot in the number two
doubles position, 8-6.

The win places the Cats at 5-
7 for the season with three
matches on tap for this
weekend.

On Friday the Cats will host
William and Mary in a key
Southern Conference en-
counter. Frank noted the im-
portance of this match
because of the relative
strength of Davidson in com-
parison to the Indians.

“We really need to win this
one because of the great ad-
vantage that Appalachian and
Furman have in the con-
ference race with scholar-
ships,’’ Frank explained. ‘‘We
are both pretty close
together.”

EYE ON THE BALL
Top speed Bill Allen intently watches the ball as he prepares

to his his forehand return.

The Cats then host Rich-
mond on Saturday, while The
Citadel comes to town on Sun-
day. Three games in three
days i is a tall order, but Frank
is hoping for the best remem-
bering that the team could get
above .500 for the first time
this season.

Frank turned to some
brighter notes by saying that
he has gotten a very high
prospect to come to Davidson
next fall. Chip Bondurant, a
top junior player in Florida,
has decided to come play ten-
nis for the Cats.

Frank expressed his
pleasure at Bondurant’s
choice, saying, ‘“We have got-
ten him away from some other
schools with scholarships.
That has to be saying
something. He is just a super
player and will really help our
program.”’

amazing new whistle. Wear it

Frank went on to state that
Bondurant will be counted
upon heavily as a freshman
next season, especially due to
the Cats loss of five of 11 team
members and the top three
singles players.

Looking at the schedule for
the rest of the season, Frank
was optimistic, depending to a
great extent on how well the
Cats do this weekend,
Needless to say Frank is
holding out for a three-game
sweep and the chance to get
the squad above the even
mark for its won-lost record
for the rest of the season.

The William and Mary mat-
ch will be the opening con-
ference game for the Cats.
They definitely need to get a
head start before Appalachian
and Furman come to David-
son on successive days later in

the campaign.
