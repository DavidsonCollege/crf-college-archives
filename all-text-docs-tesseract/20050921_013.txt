Baseball and football: Bo knows

By NATHAN BRADSHAW
Senior Staff Writer

September and October are always con-
flicted months for me. While others blithely
traipse about, reading books, writing papers,
taking tests, and having
their lives planned on a
syllabus for them, I
carry within me a strug-
gle of deep moral con-
sequences.

Do I watch’ the
Yankees or the Panthers
tonight?

I have played baseball
since I was five years
old, and I have a love
for the game that once
was America’s pastime,
but now seems merely a
playground for
Congressional drivel
and steroids, now more
than just Viagra (I
promise, that’s the only
Rafael Palmeiro joke
I'll have).

I have also been born
with the name
Bradshaw, and with it comes a world of asso-
ciations to the only Super Bowl Champion
quarterback to accidentally throw a touch-
down pass (no, we’re not related, not even
by divorce). And so, for two months of
sports overlap, I find myself violating the tel-
evangelists’ Eleventh Commandment: “Thou
shalt not change the channel.”

In all seriousness, I don’t see how anyone
can readily choose between the two. From
many Septembers and Octobers amid my
peers, I have discovered that people tend to
prefer football, for the most part. In fact,
until everyone and his Democratic candidate
became a’ Red Sox fan last year, I would
often hear the public cry of “Baseball sucks,”
or “I hate baseball,” or worse still, “Yogi
who?”

Why do you have to hate on baseball? Did

you never watch “Field of Dreams?” Were
you never on a little league team where you
got that one hit, that one peffect swing that
hit the pitch exactly on the sweet spot of the
bat and sent it screaming into deep left-cen-
ter to drive in a run and give you a stand-up

Bo Jackson played for the NFL and the MLB before injuring his hip

double? What parents don’t put their chil-
dren to bed with stories of games they
remember seeing, legends they remember
watching make history?

Of course, I already have my answer. As
any good Davidson student will do, I plan to
pull out the text. Murray Ross wrote a truly
incisive essay entitled “Football Red and
Baseball Green:” the point was essentially an
exposition of the fundamental differences
between the two sports. Even more funda-
mental than the shape and size of the ball, the
number of players, or the measure of scoring
is the philosophy, the ideal that underlies the
game.

Baseball, says Ross, is a “pastoral” game,
whereas football is “heroic” in its essence.
Baseball’s peaceful, relaxed pace, where no
clock ticks the precious seconds away and

the game will end when the game will end,
leaves the spectator with a sense of respite
from the hurried, frantic world.

Football plays on the spectator’s desire for
action, for glory, for triumph in a titanic and
physical struggle, an escape from the mun-
dane and the ordinary
into the world of brutal
combat, bodily sacrifice,
and individual prowess.

Personally, I find
nothing wrong’ with
either of these ideals.

I jump up and down,
swear at the television,
pray to such divinities as
Lombardi and Gipp, and
when it’s over I am
exhausted.

The day after my
Panthers lost to the
Patriots in Super Bowl
XXXVIII, I barely spoke
to my mother, a Pats fan.
On the other hand, I love
relaxing with a game of
baseball; where I can eat
my lunch and forget that
I have two papers, a
quiz, and six club meet-
ings to manage before the weekend is over. I
was watching and predicted Derek Jeter’s
first career grand slam (the announcers were
jinxing it with talk of his never having done
it for five minutes solid; it had to happen),
and was quietly beaming for the entire week
after.

I realize the tenor of this article may seem
primarily pro-baseball, but I promise that I
write thus largely because I believe my audi-
ence is, on the whole, pro-football.

So by all means, enjoy both the sports for
what they underscore in our society. Burst a
blood vessel screaming for a review to be
overturned and then relax with a crafty hit
and run play.

And if you’re going to “hate the Yankees,”
at least be able to name half of their starting
lineup.

’Cats extend losing streak to four

By KEVIN BIRNEY
Staff Writer

The field hockey team extended its losing
streak to four this weekend in Oxford, Ohio
with losses to Saint Louis and Miami (OH).

The ’Cats began action on Saturday
against the Billikens of St. Louis (3-4), a
club that Davidson is very familiar with from

St. Louis’s days in the Northern Pacific.

Kelly Brennan ’07 will try to help the ”Cats get a win in
their next game this Friday vs. indiana University.

Conference.

The Billikens wasted little time getting on
the board, however, scoring a goal near the
end of the sixth minute on a penalty corner.
St. Louis then added another goal in the 23rd
minute on an unassisted chance, running the
score to 2-0 by halftime.

Davidson did not give in, however, and

played much better defensively in the second —

half despite many shots on goal. Overall,
Saint Louis won the
shot battle 20-13.

In a highlight for the
’Cats, however, one of
their 13 found the ne<,
as . co-captain Emily
Davis ’06 scored off a
rebound from the goal-

keeper’s pads with
about five minutes to
play.

The score was now 2-
1, but time ran out on.a
comeback bid for the
’Cats as they dropped
their third straight.

Goalie Rachel
Kiselewich ’07 was
strong in a losing effort
with 11 saves, a career
high.

Said coach Lisa
Thompson, “We came
out so strong at the
beginning of the game,
but couldn’t convert on
early scoring opportuni-

ties.”

“We played hard aggressive hockey this
weekend but unfortunately we were unable
to finish,” said Davis.

The second half of the weekend double-
header featured the Cats against the home-
town Red Hawks from Miami (OH).
Unfortunately for Davidson, the script was
similar to the first game, as Miami scored in
the third minute and then added another goal
in the 17th. Davidson went into halftime
down 2-0.

In the second half, goalkeeper Brittany
Rollek ’09 made her debut, saving seven
shots and holding the Hawks scoreless for
the rest of the game.

Asked about the difference between the
high school and the college game, Rollek
said, “The shots at times were more chal-
lenging and the mental aspect of the game
was definitely a higher level. At the colle-
giate level you are forced to think two steps
ahead of the present play, not just one as was
the case in high school.”

Miami had 25 shots on goal during the
entire game and won 2-0, dropping
Davidson to 1-4.

“We took great shots, but just didn’t con-
nect,” Thompson said. “There are two main
areas we will be focusing on — finishing
with a goal inside the circle and not letting
opponents score on their first possession.”

Said Davis, “We came so close to scoring
several times, and we are going to be work-
ing very hard on our attack this week.” The
team’s next game is on Friday at home
against Indiana University (PA).

_. Heading into the week with a 1-6
record, the young Davidson team looked
to improve its record with the five
matches ahead, including the Spring Hill
Suites Classic hosted by Charlotte.

In the first match, held at Belk Arena
at Davidson, the team took on Liberty in
a highly contested match. Each game
had late ties and went down to the wire,
with Liberty coming back from a 2-1
game deficit to win three games to two,
knocking Davidson to 1-7. Davidson’s
effort was led by Nicole Keroack ’08
and Katie Pierucci ’08.

One the ene the Wildcats lacked

en 3. pees losing
es sa North Texas by
only four points, the "Cats once again
could not completely put it all together
for an entire match.

Against Winthrop, Davidson lost all
three games but showed a lot more of

. the improvement the team had been hop-

ing for.

Said Narr, “The team played together
much better than before. There were
signs of brilliance against Winthrop that

_ we need to build on.”

4n the Winthrop match, Davidson’s

attack was led by Tierney Hodge ’09,
