DAVIDSON SEIZED

‘BY DIME LETTER

Majority of Students Approached
Are Unfaithful to Their
Chains
By Hat Overton
Dime!

Send A Share the Wealth!
Such was the caption of many a letter
that poured into the focal postoffice last
week as the Denver chain letter fad
invaded Davidson, |

Most of the letters/are alike, bearing
the title: “PROSPERITY CLUB—In
God We Trust.” Following a list of
six names and addresses come the sug-
gestive words—Faith, Hope, Charity. The
following is a typical letter:

“Phis chain was started in hope of
bringing prosperity to you.

“Within three days, make five copies
of this letter, leaving off the top name
and address, and adding your own name
and address at the bottom of the list, and
mail to five of your friends to whom you
wish prosperity to come.

“In omitting the top name, send that
person ten cents wrapped in paper as a
charity donation.

“In turn, as your own name leaves the
top, you will receive 15,625 letters, with
donations amounting to $1,562.50. Is
this worth a dime to you?

“FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND
WATCH THE DIMES ROLL IN.”

Opportunity knocks but once, but once
it knocked several times for many for-
tunate students last week, One sopho-
more received 5 letters in the same day

The total cost of continuing the chain
equals 28 cents— 6 three-cent stamps
and a dime—a paltry price to pay for
$1,500! But the wretch who breaks the
chain is hard-hearted and keeps six peo-
ple listed from getting a total of $390.50,
the price of 7,810 ice cream sodas, or
2,003 and 1-3 banana splits.

Thirty-two of 50 students questioned,
or 64 per cent admitted having received
chain letters. Most of these got more
than one such letter, the average being
2.34 per According to
these figures, 384 students out of the
student body of 600 have been blessed
with the opportunity to become: rich, re-
ceiving a total of over 750 letters to
date,

ever, is shown by the fact that of 68

swered slightly over one-tenth.

Military Heads Permited to Con-
tinue Next Year

Major J. T, Rhett, P. S. M. & T.,

and Captain F. M. Cochran, Instructor

in Military Science and Tactics, will re-

main at Davidson College for another

year, according to orders received from({®

the ‘War Department.

Major Rhett has been at Davidson for
four years and states that he has enjoyed
the four years very much and especially
enjoyed working with the high type of
men at Davidson College; also that he
went to college in an adjoining state and
knew a lot about Davidson, and that he
had never heard of anything that was
not in favor of the school.

Captain I’, M. Cochran, who has also
served four years at Davidson, came
here direct from service in the Phillipine
Islands. He was a colonel in the late
World War and established the first
C. C. C. Camp in Western North Caro-
lina. He has been in charge of the
Freshmen taking R.O.T.C. and also has
been directing the work on the improve-
ment of the golf course, under F.E.R.A.

He states that he has gained an inti-
mate insight into this fine branch of the
service, that his associations here both
officially and socially have been most
pleasant and that he is quite proud of this
year’s graduating class who entered with
him four short years ago. He hopes they
can keep somewhat in touch as the years
go by.
