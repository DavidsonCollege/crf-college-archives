Warren Wilson president speaks on liberal arts

By DAVID WILLIAMS

“Most of us know that there
have been strong studies pub-
lished recently that call for a great-
er integration of studies and a re-
turn to a more clearly defined core
of studies at the heart of a liberal
arts education,” President John
Carey of Warren Wilson College
said before an audience of nearly
75 students and faculty in the 900
Room Tuesday night.

“T personally think that all lib-
eral arts colleges should have
‘some kind of requirement that
causes students to come to grips
with problems of a global mag-
nitude and cultures other than our
own, and to understand their own
lives and our own country and
times in the context of interna-
tional issues,” he said.

Carey, who has been influen-
tial in establishing and strengthen-
ing peace studies programs at
.Warren Wilson ard at Florida

‘ State University, said that both in-
ternational studies and peace
studies programs at American in-
stitutions of higher education have
tremendously served the purpose
of attaining this goal.

In tracing the development of
such programs, he said that before
World War II, “there were courses
in Western history and the study
of ‘Western civilization that at-
tempted to move us beyond the
parochialism that we brought to
college and the ethnocentrism that

is the site of his home and his
studio in which he sculpts wood
spirits or gnomes and miniature
people. Until Dec. 31 the site also
included the Thomas F. Clark
Company’s display/sales area,
where reproductions of .Clark’s
sculptures were sold.

The company employs 50
people who manufacture and
package 2,000 copies daily of
Clark’s creations at his Troutman
plant; an additional 100 area resi-
dents work in their homes hand-
painting the statues.

Clark’s immediate plans in-
clude opening a sales outlet on
Main Street in the former Don
Carey Insurance Company
building; Clark will continue to
sculpt, receive visitors and em-
ploy a bookkeeper and recep-
tionist at his studio. The planned
Main Street outlet will consist of a
sales counter without a showroom
of Clark’s works: “I assume it will
be a little like a laundry,” he said.
‘Visitors can see the display [at
the Grey Road studio] and have
me sign their collections.”

Joe Poteat, Clark’s national
sales manager, also represents
other artists through his Caim
Studios: Poteat’s Cairn Computer
Center will continue to operate on
Main Street.

Long-range plans remain un-
decided, Clark said.. He antici-
pates completion within six
months of a Mooresville statue re-
production factory now under
construction.

Asked if he were considering
moving his entire operation to
Mooresville following the recent
Davidson decision, Clark said,

civilization.”

But after the Second World
War, Carey noted, “the momen-
tum clearly began to develop to-
wards expanding” these pro-
grams. International education
programs soon began to feature
courses and research on geo-
graphical areas such as Africa,
India, and the far East. Institu-
tions began “joint reciprocal re-
lationships” with foreign coun-
tries, including faculty and stu-
dent exchanges. He said that be-
cause of these programs there
soon began to develop “a growing
awarenéss” among students and
faculties “that sophistication in a
world like ours goes far beyond
Western Europe and Western cul-
tures.”

Carey said that not long after
international studies programs
had become a hallmark of many
institutions, programs in peace

amazing rapidity” across the na-

‘tion. “Why did that happen?” he

asked. “Why was not the global
consciousness, the global awak-
ening of the Third World and Af-
rica and Asia and the Far East and
the interdisciplinary studies that
were a part of international af-
fairs — why was that’ not suffi-
cient?”

As peace studies programs
emerged, Carey said, they com-
prised many similarities to inter-

“That remains to be seen. We’re
growing at arate we’re not certain
about. If we keep growing like we
have been, we are going to need
both the Mooresville and David-
son offices.”: ;

Clark expected the vote’s out-
come. He requested both this and
a previous hearing (held in Janu-
ary, 1986) to ask the board to ex-
tend the zoning amendment which
permits use of residential property
for specific types of business sub-
ject to periodic review. Clark
said, “The decision the year be-
fore {at the January, 1986 hearing]
was the big surprise. I thought
they’d be more considerate of all
the people who wrote in to the
paper and who signed petitions. I
hoped all that display of sympathy
for me would change their minds,
but it did not move them. They
had every right to make the deci-
sion, of course.”

non said, “There are some margi-
nal cases, but I don’t know of
any.” Asked if the board’s deci-
sion in Clark’s case indicates
tightened enforcement of local
zoning ordinances in the future,
Brannon said, “Yes... if we
didn’t enforce the ordinance, we
might as well not have it.”
Brannon noted that Clark’s

national studies programs. A con-
cern for other cultures, an interest
in current affairs, and interests in
East-West tensions, in North-
South issues and in the problems
of the so-called “Fourth World”
embodied both types of programs.

Additionally, peace studies and .

international stutlies programs
each shared concerns for the im-
portance of experiential learning,
the need for interdisciplinary in-
quiry, and the advocacy of world
government.

Yet Carey asserted that peace
studies programs have developed
“a difference in the angle of vi-
sion” from that of international
studies. He said, “Very often in
programs of international affairs

* the world is still looked at from the

U.S. point of view.”

But students of peace studies
“make some very serious efforts
to try to find some global perspec-
tive and try to look at the involve-
ment of the United States in the
world’s political complexities

Carey noted that peace studies
programs generally focus on “the
pressing question of what alterna-
tives there are about our own na-
tional priorities” and on questions
of “better health care for our citi-
zens, better educational _re-
sources, more child care for our
citizens, and more senses of
human dignity for people of all
ethnic backgrounds and races.”

Peace studies programs also

where. The hearing also con-
cerned Section 5E, “nonconform-
ing uses of conforming struc-
tures.”

Brannon said, “He can sculpt
and he can have visitors — it’s
just the selling of the gnomes on
the premises that is prohibited by
the ordinance.” °

Under Clark’s new arrange-
ment neither sales nor orders will
be accepted at the Grey Road
studio. Instead, Clark said, “It’s
more like a little museum out
here. You go to the museum and
then to the shop at the foot of the
stairs and get your postcards and

what not. Well, that shop will be’

downtown and not here.” .

geopolitics and the behavior of
superpowers,” Carey said. Stu-
dents of peace studies recognize
that “there is a tilt to the right in’
our political consciousness. It’s
not accidental that that’s per-
ceived in cultures other than our
own.” Yet when Americans begin
to understand that both superpow-
ers have always acted and will
continue to act in predictable pat-
terns, he said, America will have
had “a breakthrough in conscious-
ness for many people about inter-
nhational perspectives.”

‘Additionally, Carey said,
peace studies emphasize the im-
portance of ideology in interna-
tional relations. Peace studies pro-
grams have been “building on a
little maxim that every country
has its own kind of ideology. And
in telling its story, certain people
benefit from telling that story in
that way.”

He noted, “If you’ve never
quite thought about this, I might
ask about that traditional ideology

bring internal love and nurture to
the family nest. Males, we’re
often told, are kind of fashioned

_by God, to work on the outside, to

struggle with the economic arena,
and women come to their fulfill-
ment in being the home creators
and nurturers and sufferers of the
life and faith.”

“It’s just kind of interesting to
ask, because we’ve all heard that
story, who benefits?” he said.

ing amendment. Ruth said, “Basi-
cally, it was a very legalistic deci-
sion that we had to make.” At the
public hearing, Ruth stated, “1
feel that legally I have no choice
no matter how sympathetic I
might be toward Dr. Clark but to
treat this as a legal matter and I see
no new evidence to change the
original decision.” Tate, who
lives on- property adjoining
Clark’s but which fronts on Davis
Road, said, “Tom is a neighbor
and I have a very friendly relation-
ship with him.

“My primary concern is the
zoning designation of the proper-
ties in that neighborhood, because
the official zoning sanction of any
business operation would tend to
lower property values ina residen-
tial neighborhood,” Tate said.

“Who keeps telling that story?”

In regard to a similar matter,
he noted that “there are a lot of
people in this country who benefit

‘from telling” the story that.“there

is a great hostile power out there
that is just about to gobble us up,
and if we don’t arm ourselves to
the teeth and be ever-vigilant, that
big bear is going to be here and
destroy everything decent about
our civilization.”

He said, “If you haven’t
thought about that, you might
think about the interesting place of
the defense industry in America,
and of what.a vested interest huge
segments of our own society have .
in telling that story.”

Carey noted that upon receiv-
ing her Nobel Peace Prize, Jane
Adams said that “her great hope
for America is that it would be a
country at its own best.” He said.

‘her. saddest thought about Ameri-

ca was that “in spite of its own ide-
als as a country that we did not live

that it’s good for women to be the—up to those ideals, and that if we

could manifest those as a country
in our own political system, we
would light our own unquencha-
ble light to'the world community
of nations.

“I do know that this is one
campus where these two stredms
of education, international studies
and peace studies, need not oper-
ate antithetically, but. coopera-
tively,” he said. “If one can do
that, I think Davidson College
will have the best there is.”

ery favored granting Clark an ex-
tension. Exlpaining her vote, she
‘noted that the board did not re-
spond to Clark’s invitation to tour
and examine his studio. “We
didn’t investigate or talk this thing
over,” she said. “I felt as if it
wasn’t done right. Some of them
[were] catering to the other side.”
The board received letters and
petitions with several hundred sig-
natures requesting the extension.
However, the board based its de-
cision on the ordinance itself
rather than on external evidence,
Ruth said.

Clark said of the decision,
“People in other towns seem sur-
prised. I’ve had people in other
towns ask me to move to their
towns. This is definitely my
home, my love.”
