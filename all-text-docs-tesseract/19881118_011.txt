Cats fall to Lafayette 38-13, end season 0-10

By BRUCE NEWSOME

The Colonial League-leading
Lafayette Leopards defeated
Davidson 38-13 last Saturday in
the Cats’ final game of the season.

The Cats came into the game
with high hopes since the Lafay-
ette starting quarterback did not
play and their back-up quarter-
back was hurt in the second quar-
ter. Because of these injuries, the
Leopards were led by a freshman
for most of the game.

However, four Davidson mis-
cues led to 24 first half points for
the Leopatds, while Davidson
was not able to get on the score-
board until the third quarter.

The first problem occurred on
the Cats’ second drive. Topher
Hardin, after handling a low snap
from center, had his punt blocked,
and Lafayette recovered in the
end zone for a touchdown. This
was a continuation of Davidson’ 8
season long punting woes.

Then, on the Cats’ first posses-
sion of the second quarter, quar-
terback Nicky Crawford fumbled
the ball and the Leopards recov-
ered it on the Davidson 26-yard
line. bay
"Six plays later, the Lafayette
tailback went in for a touchdown

to give the Leopards
a 14-0 lead.

On _ Davidson’s
next possession,
Crawford fumbled
the snap at the Lafay-
ette 29-yard line and
Lafayette recovered.
On second down and
24 yards to go from
the Davidson 47-yard
line, Lafayette con-
nected on a 47-yard
pass play for another
touchdown.

With 1:35 left in
the first half, the
punting problems
continued. Hardin’s
punt only travelled
ten yards to the
Lafayette 47-yard
line. The Lafayette
drive ended with a 47-yard fiel
goal to make the score 24-0 at the
half.

Although Davidson led in the
total yardage category at the half,
the Cats trailed by 24 points. .

On the opening drive of the
second half, Lafayette expanded
their lead to 31-0. On third down
and goal from the Davidson 5-
yard line, the Leopards ran a re-

Davidson finally got or the
scoreboard late in the third quar-
ter. The Cats went 75 yards in 13
plays and Mike Wright ran in
from 5 yards out for the touch-
down.

After Lafayette scored on their
next possession, Mike Wright

down made the score 38-13 in
favor of Lafayette.

A notable statistic for the game
was the Cats’ 5 for 6 performance

In spite of this year’s record and
his overall record at Davidson,
Gatto feels good about the prog-

quoted in The Charlotte Observer
as saying, “We feel good about
where we’re at. From a talent
level, we’ve taken a real big step.
We’re close.”

unique institution

* By HAP BRYANT

Approaching his second season, Davidson baseball
coach Jim Stoeckel is upbeat about the state of Davidson
athletics and about his program in particular.

Stoeckel sees the harmony that has developed between
the academic and athletic sides of the Davidson experience
as unique. He hopes that the institution will continue to
provide its students with opportunities to grow both physi-

- Cally and mentally.

“I think we’ re in a unique position,” says Stoeckel. “We
offer a tremendous education and an opportunity to play
high-level Division I athletics.” -

He believes that Davidson is fulfilling its call as a

’ liberal-arts institution through its commitments to aca-

- demics and athletics. “The whole goal of liberal arts is to
develop the entire person. That was, and is, my sense of
what Davison is all sbowt: Fate w seo things caring that.
