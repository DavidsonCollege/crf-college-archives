Compostable cups make > their debut on Patterson Court

KeEtsey LILLEY
News Editor

Beginning Monday, Jan. 25, Patterson
Court organizations were able to take advan-
tage of Davidson’s newest innovation in sus-
tainability: compostable cups.

Through the new electronic party regis-
tration, Patterson Court houses can now reg-
ister their party and
order the new cups,
which are similar to
the Solo brand cups,
but compostable.

The idea _ for
compostable cups
originated within the
Patterson Court Sus-
tainability Council,
a part of the greater
Patterson Court
Council. After the
initial concept was
discussed, Patterson

to be maintained.
This includes environmental,
social and economic
responsibilities...”

ability Chair Lee Dorsey ’12

with the correct type and opacity cup, Dors-
ey said he settled on a brand “based on what
is most similar” to the traditional Solo cup,
made by Genpak Harvest.

Looking and feeling like a Solo cup, the
minor difference between the compostable
cups and traditional plastic cups is that the
new cups are white, rather than red.

The compostable cups also provide a va-
riety of benefits that
the typical plastic
cups do not. In four
to six weeks, the
corn-based and bio-
degradable cups de-
compose without re-
leasing toxins, unlike
the 450 years needed
for decomposition
and toxic chemicals
released by typi-
cal petroleum-based
cups.

In addition, the

Court Sustainability

Chair Lee Dorsey ’12 said that he began re-

searching the prospect of compostable cups.

“T kind of got caught up in it and it...
expanded and multiplied,” he said. After a
lengthy “cold calling” process to companies
and distributors through Davidson’s Dining
Services that included finding companies

use of compostable
cups means that potential waste is diverted
from taking up space in a landfill to being
used as compost around campus, saving not
only fuel costs and pollution, but also saving
the College from having to buy all its com-
post.
Dorsey said that this change will improve

Davidson’s _ sustainabil-
ity, but noted that his un-
derstanding of “sustain-
ability” differs from its
stereotype.

“We must move be-
yond the ‘tree hugger’
stigma generally asso-
ciated with sustainabil-
ity and recognize its full
implications,” he said.
“Sustainability is the
ability to be maintained.
This involves environ-
mental, social and eco-
nomic responsibilities to
the communities that sur-
round us both closely and
more distant. I sought to
consider all of these fac-
tors in developing the
compostable cup initia-
tive.”

The new compostable
cups are being offered
for sale to Patterson
Court organizations at
the price of $5.00 per 50
pack, compared to $5.22
for the same amount of
Solo cups, as locally re-
tailed. Rather than being

ERNEST FINNEY PATTERSON AWARDS

The Ernest Finney Patterson Awards recognize and
honor the life of Emest Finncy Patterson, beloved
professor of econmics at Davidson College (1957-1979)
and social activist.

The Department of Economics will grant up to a total
of $1,200 a year to subsidize formal study, research,
field work, or community service by currently enrolled
students at Davidson College that promotes improving
society and bettering the human condition consistent
with the personal ideals of Professor Patterson. More
information and application forms can be found at
Davidson’s Economics Homepage at:
http://www3.davidson.edu/cms/x3632.xml

Completed applications are due by February 12, 2010 |
to Dr David Martin, Chair of the Department of
Economics.

subsidized or paid for out
of grant money, the lower
cost of the compostable
cups is due to price ne-
gotiations with the com-
pany.

Dorsey also noted
that as Davidson establishes a reputation for
buying compostable cups in bulk with this
new company, Patterson Court organizations
might see a slight price decrease in the fu-
ture.

According to estimates from the social
chairs of Patterson Court organizations, more
than 33,000 cups are used per semester at
registered court parties, not including house-
only functions, apartment parties or general
student body use.

Dorsey said that the availability of com-
postable cups only to registered court parties
is a first step toward opening the process to
the rest of the campus, allowing the Sustain-
ability Council “to iron out all the creases in
the process” before allowing a larger variety
of groups to purchase the cups.

In addition, Dorsey noted that this semes-
ter is a good time to initiate such a project
to ensure that new Patterson Court members
become used to using compostable cups and
the new recycling protocols, then continuing
the tradition for future members.

Already this semester, Dorsey noted al-
most 100 percent participation among Patter-
son Court organizations in recycling, a major
increase from past semesters.

Changes in recycling protocol include
having a recycling bin behind the bar of ev-
ery court party to allow for easier recycling,

separating compostable cups from cans or
any other trash and placing all recycling on
the curb for pickup by Physical Plant. Dorsey
said that these changes may be incorporated
into the Patterson Court Standards if ap-
proved by organization presidents.

Dorsey attributed the success of the proj-
ect to cooperation between and among a mul-
titude of organizations on campus. In partic-
ular, he recognized the structure of Patterson
Court as allowing individuals the freedom,
but also the support, to take on projects like
compostable cups.

“Without PCC, who would I sell [the
idea] to? There’s no legitimacy,” Dorsey
said. “What’s my base to build from? There’s
the entire student body...The magnitude of
that would essentially be starting a small
business.”

“The structure of the Court encourages
the most efficient environment for devel-
oping lasting change,” he continued. “The
impact of a little effort from many people is
magnified. I believe that here, on the Court,
at Davidson, we have the opportunity to cre-
ate a community that changes communities
and that starts with the individual; with you
and with me. Together we can all make a
sustainable difference.”
