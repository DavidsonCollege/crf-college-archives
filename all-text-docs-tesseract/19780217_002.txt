Kello announces plans for NC Fellows

By CAROL LOPTSON
Staff Writer :

After the Orientation week-
end for newly selected mem-
bers, the North Carolina Fel-
lows, are now concentrating on
firming up internship plans and
scheduling speakers for lun-
cheons during Spring term.
Director of N.C. Fellows John |
Kello, Professor of Psychology,
and Louise T. Martin, Assis-
tant Director, have also
begun looking over evaluation
forms turned in by participants
in the selection process.

‘‘We’re on a week at a time,
month at a time basts for
now,” said Kello.

The Orientation Weekend
was held January 27-28 at a

_ private beach home. The new

Fellows ived and discussed
a packet of information on the
structure of the program, inclu-
ding funding strategy, an ex-
tensive report on last year’s
internships, and a presentation
of possible workshops, retreats,
and program activities.

N.C. Fellows invites local
leaders in various professions to
speak at luncheons held every
other Friday. Recent speakers
were Dr. John Melbourne of the
Neighborhood Medical Clinic in
Charlotte, former Senator Sam
Ervin, and Charles Ravenel,
nominee for Democratic candi-
date for the Senate from South
Carolina.

According to Program Chair-

man Maria Patterson, “Our

SGA elections signup

All interested sophomores and juniors sign up
in Dean Tery’s office from between Tuesday,
February 21, and Tuesday, March 14.
Elections will be held March 21.

big thing this year is to try to
open up the speaker programs
to the whole campus.”

Patterson is corresponding
now with several possible
speakers for Spring term, inclu-
ding local political leaders, a
spokesman from Spirit Square
(a cultural and educational cen-
ter in Charlotte), and'a book
reviewer and staff reporter from
the Charlotte Observer.

In addition to speakers se-
veral other programs will be

held this spring. In April, a’

representative from the Center
for Creative Leadership will
hold a half day workshop for
Fellows. Early in the Spring
term, there will be a luncheon in
Charlotte with a group of
bankers.

Ken Wood will discuss in-
ternship goals and ways to get
the most out of internships. The
Fellows also plan to have a
luncheon for first year faculty
members.

The Fellows are encouraged
to suggest speakers and activi-
ties they are interested in, and
to help arrange the programs.
“We're not providing shows,”
quipped Kello.

“We rely on the input of the
group. Weare fortunate to have
had a succession of Program
chairmen who’ve been very
interested and involved,” said
Kello.

Internship plans are now

being finalized for many sopho-
more and junior Fellows. Both
Martin, who is an “excellent
source for contacts’’ according
to Kello, and Kello himself are
working with Fellows on defin-
ing internships.

A few examples of the intern-
ships being considered include
a medicine-related program in
South Asia, chemistry research
with a company in New York,
political internships with Con-
gressmen, and internships with
doctors and lawyers.

“T want to emphasize that the
impetus comes from the stu-
dents. N.C. Fellows does not
provide a smorgasbord of in-
ternships. We try to choose
students who are self-starters.
Our job is to provide as many
resources for these students as
possible,’’ said Kello.

Freshman Fellows are still
“digging around and thinking
about internship possibilities,”
explained Kello.

“We had some tremendous
internships last year because
students were’ interested
enough to put in a lot of effort
and time to get them, but the
program is not a magic carpet,”’
commented Kello.

Kello and Martin have begun
to look over evaluation forms
from selection, but an intensive
review will not begin until this
summer. Any changes in the
selection process are ‘‘still sub-

ject to discussion,”’ according to
Kello.

One possibility under consi-
deration js. to allow interviewers
more time with each candidate.

A second possibility is to trim
the initial screening process
from three weeks down to two
weeks to avoid having to com-
pile results over Christmas
break when no secretarial help
is available.

A third possibility is to have
the same people serve as inter-
viewers and group observers. In
the recent selection, individual
interviewers and group obser-
vers sometimes differed widely
on their evaluations of a candi-
date.”” The same people really
need to be seeing all of it,’”’ said
Kello.

Evaluation forms _ also
showed that having N.C. Fel-
lows visit Freshman halls was
“especially effective’ according
to Kello. Kello also said that the
basic calendar for selection
would remain much the same as
this year’s.

In talking about the evolu-
tion of the Program, Kello siad
that a few years ago, N.C.
Fellows concentrated on intern-
ships. ‘‘While that is still a
major focus of the program, our
idea of the program now is to
make it a more active, direct
organization. We seek to encou-
rage leadership development
through service.”’
