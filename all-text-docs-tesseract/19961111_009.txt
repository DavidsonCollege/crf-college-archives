Antidisestablishmentarianism

You know, there are plenty of
brilliant people around here, and if
you’renot one of them, that’s okay.

I realize that you might feel
like a clod for being so thoroughly
overshadowed by other people’s
academic records, but as someone
who is in the same position, let me
offer you a few ways to make
yourself feel better about it or make
other people think that your grades
are an anomaly in the life of a
soon-to-be-recognized-as-brilliant
human being.

One way is to adopt a lifestyle
that’s appropriate ‘to your lousy
performance in class.

Here are some examples of
decisions you’ll need to make to
fulfill this image: Monday’s the
first day of the week, so get sauced
to loosen up your brain and make

-homework go more smoothly later
on.

Tuesday’s twenty-one-year-
old night, and I don’t need to tell
you what that means.

Wednesday’s the mid-week
slump, soa little party-pick-me-up
will make things more interesting.
Thursday’s almost the weekend,

and so take full advantage of this
and go boozing. :

Friday and Saturday are, of
course, the weekend, which means
the Court is open. Sunday’s a day
of rest and therefore a good day to
study.

you'll feel okay.

Now, you may be more con-
cerned with people’s image of you
than with your inner struggle over
why you always get Cs. If this is
the case, and people think you’re

if you’ ll only do the same.

Since you probably don’ thave
the best memory from books,
studying all of the six-syllable
words in the dictionary and then
forgetting them will not be the best

way to sound smart.

Of course, becoming rich and/or
famous sometimes involves gradu-
ate schools, who unfortunately
have a skewed understanding of
the role grades play in one’s aca-
demic life.

Keep this consideration as far
out of your mind as possible, and

an effing moron, this can easily be
overcome.

Everyone here uses words that
are frighteningly large, and in ev-
eryday conversation at that. Two

a genius,” and s/he may further-
more come over to your carrel and

say something along the lines of,
“That reminds me of an article I
read in last month’s Journal of the
Evils of Western Culture.”

You may then enter into a
conversation about whatever s/he
thinks you were talking about.

Talk as little as possible and
nod regularly, inserting comments
like, “Yeah,” “Absolutely,” and,
“You mean someone else feels the
same way I do?”

Now s/he might be a big faker

’ like you, and if you get the feeling

that this is the case, ask them to
explain what s/he meant by that
last comment.

This may shatter his/her im-
age of you as a genius, but if s/he
can’t tell you what s/he meant, you
will have found a fellow member
of the intellectual underclass and a
true friend forever.

If you’d just as soon be known
as someone who’s cool as hell but
doesn’t get the best grades in the
world, that’s okay.

Just make sure you satisfy the
first part of the description, which
is something you really might not
want to bet money on.

‘Too Much Sex

The following is an opinion
on the issue of sex and society:
society is saturated to an obnox-
ious degree with sex. Now wait a
minute, you object. Sex is anatural
part of human life. Surely there is
nothing wrong with a frank
acknowledgement of its rightful
place in human affairs. We con-
cur. Unfortunately, in our society
sex is referred to in connection
with practically every aspect of
life so that it is seen as the only
thing that motivates or that is of
any real significance. Frankly,
this Freudian theme has become a
bore. There are plenty of other
natural, enjoyable aspects of life to
champion. ‘

We say, it’s time to crown a

new monarch. One might argue
that food, or the act of eating it-
self, is already well on its way to
the throne. Very well! Letus com-
plete the ceremony and contrive
to exploit the role of eating to the
utmost! Call in to your local radio
stations and request “‘ Cheesebur-
ger in Paradise” and “Eat It” ad
nauseam. Demand the inclusion
of chefs and gastronome in block-
buster movies. Bring to the atten-
tion of music television the de-
plorable lack of food in their vid-
eos. Boycott all merchandise
whose advertisements do not men-
tion food. Advise the producers of
Friends. that they will boost their
ratings if only they will change
their tack. Forexample, have them

advertise as such: “ Next time on
Friends, will Rachel and Ross go
out for pizza... Or stay in for a Full
Course Meal?!” Perhaps you might
also suggest that instead of alluding
slyly to old hat sex jokes, characters
could coyly bring out a favorite
fruit or veggie to tantalize the
viewers.Cosmopolitan can run
headlines like, “Killer Milk Shakes:
Women Who Know Tell All.” Food
ads should be filmed in black and
white to add an air of mystique (As
a kindness, inform Levi’s and
Calvin Klein of this technique as
well. They may also want to do
something creative with silver-
ware).
You get the point.

Do We Care

The proposal I made in SGA
to give Veterans’ Day the same
privileges as Martin Luther King
Day has been tabled by the SGA
to be considered at a later date.
