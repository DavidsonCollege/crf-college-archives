Y Devotional
Penned By 66
Contributors

The YMCA's devotional booklet
for January, February, and March,
“Faith on the Campus,” was dis-
tributed through the dorms yester-
day, with contributions from %6
members of the student body.

Stuart Plummer, in charge of
publication, explained that holidays
were the cause of the tardiness of
January appearance, and stated that
work will begin soon on the spring
issue,

Four “themes” run through the
three-month guide. The first is the
Kingdom of God, the marks of its
citizens, and the meaning of the
Kingdom for various classes of
people. The second theme is that
of prayer. There are «discussions
on prayer, and then a breakdown
of the Lord’s Prayer over a two
week period. The Christian attitude
toward such things as gluttony,
drink, sex, politics, and science and
religion are treated next. The final
section, the latter part of March,
is composed of writings on the
meaning of the Cross.

In addition to the four major
themes, there are also special in-
sertions in 18 instances.

Of Expected Goal

Final pledges to the 1951 YMCA
Christmas Gift fund amounted to
approximately $3,500—$2,500 short
of its goal—it was announced today
by chairman Bryan Robinson.

Of the pledged total, about
$2,500 has been collected. Rob.
inson pointed to the fact that
yesterday, January 10, was the
deadline for payment of the
pledges and urged that all out-
standing pledges be paid as
soon as possible.

All money must be in the hands
of the YMCA before checks can
be sent to the various recipients—
The Caswell Training School, re-

AtNCAA Meeting Radio Troupe

By JIM MOORE

Davids« ollege has sent two
representa..ves to the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association meet-
ing in Cincinnati this weekend.
They are Dr. Frontis Johnston, a
member of the faculty committee
on athletics, and Mr, P. K. Scott,
Director of Athletics.

The two men are representing
Davidson and its athletic policy on
a national level. They are expected
to go along with the recent recom-
mendations of the Presidents of the
Southern Conference which Da.
vidson supported at the time of
their formulatién. These recom-
mendations, if adopted, would bring
about a de-emphasis of athletics.

Two Maxims .

The general athletic policy of the
school, as outlined by President
Cunningham in a recent statement
to the Raleigh News & Observer
consists of two maxims. (1)) No
activity, academic or otherwise, de-
serves a place on the college cam.
pus unless it contributes positively
to the educational process. (2) In-
ter.collegiate athletics can claim no
special exemption from this test.

Meeting for its 46th annual con-| few recommendations this year,

Hetics, particularly

vention, January 10-12, the 300-
odd member association will con-
sider rules aimed at changing it
from a loose supervisory group into
a body with power to enforce strict
controls over athletic practices.
Mainly it is a question of whether
the NCAA should assume broad
legislative powers or should con.
tinue as a body whose principal
functions are establishing rules of
play and conducting championships.
TV or Not TV
Problems of televising of foot-
ball games; over-emphasis of ath-
football; the
sports gambling scandals; the re-
duction or abolition of off season
practice sessions; and the future
of post-season bowl games were a
few of the matters expected to come
before the NCAA members wher
they got down to the weighty par.
of their convention Thursday.
The rules committee of the Foot-
ball Coaches Association, whose de-
usually are an im-

To Play Here

The famed Longines Symphon.
ette Orchestra, one of the world’s
most renowned symphonettes, will
appear at Davidson Wednesday
night, January 16, at 8:15 o'clock,
Mr. J. C. Pfobl, director of music,
has announced. The Symphonette
is making its initial tour of the
country,

Conducted by Mishel Piastro, the
Symphonette has won fame for its
radio broadcasts and public concerts
since its formation ten vears ago.
The group broadcasts each Sunday
afternoon over the CBS radio net-
work in addition to other broad-
casts and public appearances.

Setections included on their pro-
gram are: “Aria” by Bach, Fritz
Kreigler Favorites, including solos

by the first violinist, “Claire de
Lune” by Debussy, and “Die
Fledermaus” selections by = J.

Strauss.

The Symphonette is actually a
full symphony orchestra in all re-
spects except number, with all in.
struments represented. The main
difference between the Symphon-
ette and the usual symphony or.
chestra is merely the fact that
the Symphonette has a smaller
string section.

The number of musicians mak-
ing the broadcasts vary; slightly ac-
cording to music being played that
day. The 31 New York musicians
to play at Davidson with Mishel
Piastro are the average number
heard on the radio, They are often
times referred to.as “the average
man’s symphony orchestra,” for
they play short, light pieces of
great composers.

The magnificence in their playing
is achieved through using some of
New York City’s finest musicians
and playing only mnsic from com-
posers’ original scores.

Author's Family
Presents Library
Studies Of Ney

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson, di-
rector of the Davidson College li
brary, announced today the gift of
a collection of unique material per-
taining to North Carolina's mvs.
terious Peter Stuart Ney by the
family of the late Dr, James Ed-
ward Smoot of Concord.

Dr. Smoot devoted many years
to research concerning Ney and,
like many others, arrived at the
conclusion that the North Caro.
lina school teacher was the same
man as Napoleon's famous Marshal
Ney of France. ;

Dr, Smadot's, conclusions appeared
an his book, “Marshal Ney—Refore
and After Execution,” published in
1929,

Many Photos

The Concord doctor collected
numerous photographs from Ameri-
ca and France for his book, A great
number of these were used as illus.
trations for his book, although
many had to be omitted.

Dr. Smoot also acquired many
additional pictures and papers after
the publication of his biography.
It was his plan to revise the book
and incorporate the additional ma-
terial, but he had not had the re,
visions published at the time of his
death.

Gift Contents

These photographs, the volumi-
nous correspondence and the addi-
tional chapters to “Marshal Ney—
Before and After Execution” form
the bulk of the material which was
presented to Davidson College.

Also included in the gift are 15
printed volumes pertaining to
Marshal Ney. Several of these are
French editions and very rare in
this country.

French Works

The works include two volumes
of “Memorie Du Marechal Ney,”
published by his family in Paris in
1833, and the monumental three-
volume “La Vie Militarire Du
Marechal Ney,” by General H. Bon-
nal, which was published in Paris
in 1911,

Regardless of the identity of the
two men, Davidson College has a
vital interest in Peter Stuart Ney.
In 1840, he designed the official seal

Highway Pleas
Hit Red Tape

In line with the December 14th
Davidsonian article dealing with
the poor stretch of road between
here and Charlotte, Dr. Cunning-
ham has written Governor Scott
inquiring about altering the foad
so as to by-pass the Davidson
township.

Acting upon this letter, Gover.

||} nor Scott wrote Henry Jordan,
'} chairman of

the State Highway
Commission, asking him about it.
He, in turn, wrote Otis ‘Poole,
Highway Commissioner for this
division, asking him to communi-
cate with Dr. Cunningham.

Mr. Poole’s letter to Dr.
Cunningham mentioned that
such a road had been discussed
previously by himself and Mr.
Beaty, division engineer, but
that nothing definite has been
decided.

Mr. Poole stated that he would
contact Dr. Cunningham early this
year to arrange a conference with
him. As yet, nothing further has
been done.

Foster has done extensive
work in the radio, wire service
and newspaper ficlds, A New
England Yankee, he was grad-
uated from Dartmouth College.

He is visiting this area to com-
memorate the expanding of facilities
by station WIST in Charlotte and
comes to the campus as a result
of the cooperation of Mr. R. A.
Furr of that station.

Foster steers to the right of
center in political. matters and

jects along the coast near
Pawley’s Island.

Mr. Murry. who is formerly of
Charlotte, resigned from a highly
successful business some ten years
ago to devote himself exclusively
to painting.

Philip Moose, director of fine
arte at Davidson, highly praised
the work of Mr. Murry, point-
ing out that the paintings now
on display “reflect the artist’s
understanding and love for the
misty, ever-changing play of
light over mountains and hills.
“They have the flowing wetness

which bespeaks an artist with great
command of his medium and a man
who has found peace and content.

At a meeting last Friday of the
Interfraternity Council and frater-
nity presidents, it was decided to
go ahead with the program pro.
posed by Adams and his Greek
Week Committee.

This proposition is purely
experimental and participation ,
is voluntary, but the enthusias-
tic reception it received from
the majority was encouraging.
Stockton reported most of the

frats expressed their whole.

few were dubious, and some even
hostile; but this was expected.

The tentative schedule for the
week is as follows: Monday after-
noon there will be a combined
pledge project to make the David-
son business community sanitary
and beautify it wherever possible,

The colored school building
will receive a coat of paint and
the entire project will be under
the direction of Pete Kalo-
gridis.

Both Monday and Wednesday
nights will see an exchange of
pledge groups at supper, with one
half of cach class visiting another
house one night, and then reversing
the situation the next. Sandy Mor.

put on a skit for the entertain.
ment of its fellow pledges.
There. is is a tentative contest

scheduled for Wednesday afternoon
between the brothers and pledges
of each fraternity, but it is not
definite as yet what game will be
played.

Possibly a medicine ball will be
utilized, or something similar, and
Bob Boyd will be in charge of this
event,

Wednesday night will see a

ROTC Deferment
Adds To Service

A discussion of the mandatory
signing of new deferment agree.
ments by those men wishing to re-
main under deferment contracts
was presented the junior and senior
members of the Davidson regiment
this week by PMS&T Lt. Col. J. L.
Ballard.

Under the new deferment agree-
ment a student accepts his com-
mission with the understanding
that he will be in the reserve corps
for cight years instead of five years
as prescribed in the old deferment
act.

The student still must take
his two yeara of basic ROTC
training and then apply for ad.
mission into the advanced
course. If he is accepted then
he will continue for his last
two years in ROTC and upon
gtaduation accept a commis-
sion in the army.

Two years of active duty are
required of the officer and this
length of time is included in the
eight year period. 1

A new requirement for accept.
ance into the advanced course is.
that the student must have signed
the new deferment agreement.
