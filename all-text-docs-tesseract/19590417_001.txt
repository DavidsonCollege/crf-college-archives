Bowl Team Heads For
DC-Minnesota Wrangle

By ERVIN DUGGAN
Davidsonian Managing Editor

“ “Twas brillig, and the slithy toves—” Before the question was finished, a light

flashed and the answer came.
“Sir, that’s from Lewis Carrol’s ‘Jabberwocky’
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the rest of the poem

Glass.’ The voet’s real name
goes like this—”

So it went in the last practice
session of Davidson's College
Bowl Team Wednesday. The
questions came, and the answ-
ers came fast. Right answers,
too.

After weeks of preparation,
the team was ready. Numerous
practice sessions were behind
them. Hours of study in alma-
macs, textbooks, newspapers
past. Now what lay ahead was

a two-day period of rest and.

study in Spartanburg, S. C.,
then Saturday’s plane trip to
Minneapolis and the big game
before millions of viewers on
Sunday afternoon.

“We're scared,” said team
captain Bobby Livingston, “but
the team has gotten together
real well and worked hard. Tell

was

everybody we're hopeful.”

The four top scholars left by
car Wednesday night for a stay
at team member Laurens Wal-
ker's home in Spartanburg.
They will drive to Charlotte
early tomorrow morning, where
they will meet Professor Paul
‘Marrotte and team alternate
Monty Bracey and fty to Min-
neapolis.

Eastern Airlines officials an-
nounced this week that they
will sponsor a send-off cere-
mony at Charlotte airport to-
morrow morning before the
team leaves on the 9:30 am.
flight to Minnesota.

The team will arrive in Min-
neapolis late tomorrow. After

Kuykendall Calls For

New Court

Of Control

A presentation of a revised constitution and recom-

mendations for changes in

the Court of Control were

passed into the hands of the newly elected Student Coun-
cil Monday night. In its final meeting of the year, the
1958-1959 council concluded business on these items and
prepared for the change of administration.

John Kuykendall, student
body president, presented the
suggestions for revising the
eonstitution in chapel today.
Mimeographed copies were dis-
tributed at. the doors. The
changes involve no amendments
but only a rewording of misun-
derstood statements and sec-
tions affected by amendments
passed this year. The student

body will vote on the revision
at a later date.

COURT INEFFECTIVE
In its written recommenda-
tions, the council expressed
disappointment in the lack of
effectiveness of the Court of
Control and suggested consid-
erable re-evaluation and modl-

fication of its program. It feels
a shorter period of jurisdiction
is desirable.

Only four of the present reg-
ulations are advocated in the
effort to streamline and short-
en the present system. They
are: 1—Freshmen required to
uphold Davidson tradition of
speaking to everyone they meet
on campus; 2—must wear caps;
3—cannot walk on grass; and
4—must wear orientation name
tags.

GREEN INSTALLED

Dee Green will be installed
as the new Student Council
President in chapel next Tues-
day. At that time the new coun-
cil will also take office.

the Davidson students will re-
tire for a good night's rest be-
fore Sunday's activities. The
group declined a telegraphed
message from Minnesota’s team
offering Saturday night dates
(“Sounds like sabotage,” said
one team member), asking the
Minnesota team captain to ar-
range dates for Sunday evening
instead.

On Sunday at 5 p.m. (EST)
the contest between Davidson
(student body: 900) and the Uni-
versity of Minnesota (student
body: 26,000) will be beamed
across the nation via the net-
work facilities of CBS. “It’s like
another meeting between David
and Goliath,” said a faculty
member. “I just hope the out-
come is as satisfactory.”

Over thirteen thousand alum-
ni, parents and “friends of the
college” this week received ad-
vance postal notices of the
team’s Sunday appearance. In
addition, students were urged
to notify friends of the pro-
gram, called by President D.
G. Martin “the best opportunity
for national publicity in the
history of this college.”

Meanwhile, the team mem-
bers attempted to remain as
calm as possible. The Spartan-
burg trip was proposed and the
college approved it as a way
of protecting the team from
last-minute jitters.
