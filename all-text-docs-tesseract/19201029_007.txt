Bob Miles, our “Y” secretary last DR. THORNTON C. WHALING
year, received a warm welcome here HEADS COLUMBIA THEO-
during his short visit last week. He LOGICAL SEMINARY.
stayed over Saturday morning and —_~——
then went to the game in Charlotte. Classmate of Woodrow Wilson
Stands High in List of Davidson's
Sons.

Rev. Dr. Thornton Whaling, President
of Columbia Theological Seminary, was
born at Radford, Va., June 5, 1858.

He, with President Woodrow Wilson,
entered Davidson as a member of the
class of '77, but like the President did
not remain at Davidson long enough to
carry away the diploma of the College.
Towever, he made good this deficiency
by winning the A. B. degree at Roanoke
College in 1879; the family having moved
from Charlotte to Salem, Va., and that
of A.M., in 1885.

He attended Union Theological Sem-
' inary, New York, 1879-1881, and Colum-
bia Theological Seminary, 1882-1883.
Roth Austin and Roanoke College
honored him with the degree of D.D.,
and later the Southwestern Presbyterian
University added an LL. D. to his name
and, in continuance of the good work,
Louisiana College made him Doctor of
Literature.

Ordained to the Presbyterian ministry
in 1883, Dr. Whaling held pastorates in
Cheraw, S.C. and Birmingham, Ala.
from 1883 to 1902. From 1892 to 1806 he
served as Professor of Philosophy and
Economics in Southwestern
rian University. From 1896 to 1905 he
='was pastor of the church at Lexington,
Va. Called from Lexington to Dallas.
‘Texas, he served in the pastorate here
from 1905 to 1911.

Since tout Dr. Whaling has been Pres-
ident of Coiumbia Theological Seminary
and in connection with the duties of this
office has ‘filled the chair of Didactic and
Polemic Theology.

During these busy years
teacher, and executive, he has found
time to write a great deal. In addition
to his contributions to the
papers and quarterlies he has written
and published among others, the follow-
ing books: The Church and Education;
Jesus Christ and Christian
Questions in Theology.

In 1913 Dr. Whaling was chosen to
deliver the Avera Bible Lectures at
| Trinity College. ;

It might be difficult to decide in what
line of work Dr. Whalitig ‘has attained
his most marked success.
is most widely and favorably known as
an orator, as a sermon-maker, as a
writer, interested particularly in both
philosophy and theology and ecclesiasti-
cal questions. Both in religious periodi-
jcals and on the floor of the Church
courts from the lowest to the highest
he has proven himself a brilliant debater
and profound thinker. In his platform
work he lacks neither thought, oratorical
power, or cogency in argument or pro-
nouncement. His command of English
is notable and affecting as he does the
polysyllabic word, the ambitious phrase,
and the rhetorical figure, and enlivening
his discourse, where occasion permits,
with a touch of humor, he is heard in

tion, if a person capable of filling Carl

Just now the club is working on col-
lege songs, such as “O Davidson,” and
“Alma Mater,” Later on a good deal of
popular music will be taken up.

A tour of Southern female colleges is
being arranged for February. Plans are
under way for concerts at Queens, Win-
throp, Converse and Agnes Scott.
