served. Among those who were present
were Misses Louise Manning, Sarah

Annie Jones, Anne Payne, the Misses
Hood and the Misses Smith, and
Messrs. Foster, Harding, McClure,

HAND BOOKS ARRIVE.

The Y. M. C. A. Hand Book for
1915-16 was distributed to the students
the first part of last week. This little
book is published annually by the ¥. M.
C. A., and contains much valuable in-
formation for the students, both old and
new.

Among the things to be found within
its covers are the names of the student
body and class officers, and also those of
the Athletic Association and Y. M. C.
A. The rolls of the student council.
fraternities, and other organizations are
given in full, The directory of stu-
dents found in the back of the book will
be of great value to all, as will also the
information relating to the library, li-
brary societies, honor svstem, etc.

This year’s edition is practically the
same as that of last vear, very few
changes being made. The editing and
publication was in charge of L. G. Fad-
gerton, -as manager, assisted by J. A.
Thames.

Y. M. C. A. MEFTING.

The regular meeting-of the Y. M. C.
A. last Thursday night was led by Mr.
P. B..Price (17). His subject was
“Prayer.”

He chose four Bible characters to
illustrate the different types of prayer.
Enoch was a man of ceascless prayer.
He walked with God; and doubtless
talked with Him as he walked. Jacob
was a man of importunate prayer, spend-
ing a whole night wrestling with the
Lord, and as a blessing he was changed
from Jacob the thief of ‘man, to Israel.
the prince of God. Elijah was the man
of faith in prayer—his prayer to relieve
the three-year famine came when the
sky was clear, but the seventh praver
brought rain. Jesus was a man of pas-
sionate prayer, sweating great drops of
blood in Gethsemane.

From these examples, prayer should
be ceaseless, importunate, faithful and
passionate. Tt should he specific and
purposeful, and made alone and aloud
to give more direct communion with
God.

Announcement was made of the
Chapman-Alexander meetings, and earn-
est praver was offered for their success.

Trinity College—Through the gener-
osity of Messrs. James B.+and Benja-
min N. Duke, a granite wall thirty
inches high will be built around the
campus of Trinity College. Work will
be begun immediately and the wall com-
pleted as soon as possible. Since ‘Trinity

base ball team is utilizing the good fall
weather for baseball practice, and states
that practice will continue as long as the
weather will permit. About forty men
are out trying for positions.

A “cub” reporter on a New York
newspaper was sent to Paterson to write
the story of the murder of a rich manu-
facturer by thieves. He spread himself
on the details and naively concluded his
account with this sentence: “Fortun-
ately for the deceased, he had deposited
all of his money in the bank the day be-
fore, so he lost practically nothing but
his life.”"—-Harper’s.

A Scotch minister in need of funds
thus conveyed his intentions to his con-
gregation:

“Weel, friends, the kirk is urgently in
need of siller, and as we have failed to
get money honestly we will have to see
what a bazaar can do for us.”—Tit-bits.

We are always giad to see you.
