THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 28, 1927 :

WILDCAT MIRACLE-MEN

MONK YOUNGER

TEX TILSON

Younger and Tilson Given Sobriquets
of “Gloomy Boys” and ‘‘Miracle Men”

Sporting writers and football fans like
to call Monk Younger and Tex Tilson the
“gloomy boys” of North Carolina football.
At Davidson College, where they coach,
they’re looked upon as miracle men.

Back in the fall of 1923 Monk Younger
and Tex Tilson arrived in Davidson, fresh
fromthe Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
where Younger had been a gridiron coach
for many seasons, and Tilson had just
completed a spectacular gridiron career,
as V. P. I. lineman and captain. They
found football interest at Davidson at a
low ebb, and a scarcity of gridiron ma-
terial that appalled them.

It had been six years since the Davidson
Wildcats had made ny sort of showing
in state football circles, and there seemed
little “chance of improvement with the
mediocre material with which Younger
and Tilson were called upon to work.
When sport scribes introduced them-
selves to Younger and asked what he
thought of Davidson’s chances to stage
a comeback on the gridiron, he let up a
howl of despondentcy that was echoed
throughout the South. That was in 1923.
He is still “crying” over Davidson’s pros-
pects along with Tilson, who has stuck by
him in his remorse. They never smile.
That’s why they’re called the “gloomy
boys” among North Carolina coaches.

A glimpse at the records explains why
Davidson fans look upon them as miracle
performers, and why they’ve made sucha
scramble to retain the two coaches. After
a dismal showing during the season of
1923, Monk and Tex returned to the lair
of the Wildcats, still gloomy, and set to
work building up an eleven that surprised
even its closest friends by the spectacular
climb to third place among North Caro-
lina’s “Big Five.” The following season,
the Davidson Wildcats, now accustomed
to the Younger-Tilson tactics, went
through a highly gratifying season ‘and
ended in a tie for second- place honors
among the leading teams in the state.

It was during the fall of 1926 that Monk
Younger and Tex Tilson sprang their big-
gest surprise. The wisest sport observers
in the Old North State, impressed with
Younger’s gloom, predicted early in the
season that Davidson, with a light team
and no outstanding players, would do well
to keep out of the “cellar” position in the
standing of North Carolina elevens, while
a majority of sport scribes frankly de-
clared that. Davidson was destined to end
the season a’ weak third or a probable
SS that abi contender,

Thanksgiving Day rolled around’ and

morning to read in their papers that Da-

Carolina fans awoke on Sunday

vidson had won the 1926 “Big Five”
pionship, having passed through the en-
tire season without suffering a defeat at
the hands of a single North Carolina
eleven. Carolina had been trounced by
the Wildcats in one of the most startling
gridiron reverses several years, and
had bowed to the Wildcats in a 10-0 de-

LUNCH IN GYM

(Continued from page one)
ing Day program has held such an attractive
feature, and while there will be no speeches
or entertainment during the luncheon, it will
be ari excellent opportunity for the old men
to get together before the game.

The high spot of the day’s program will
start at 2:30 o'clock, at which time V. M. I. |
and Davidson will clash on Richardson Field
for the Wildcats’ second encounter on their
home ground. This game bids fair to be one

of the teams have shown up well in the games
they have already played this year. Davidson
is anxious for the chance to trounce the
Cadets for the defeat at Lynchburg last year,
when the Wildcats took the small end of a
12-7 score. A record crowd ‘is expected for
this game, and ticket sales already promise to |
surpass any of former years.

“Stunt Night,” a regular feature of Home-
coming Day, will be staged in Shearer Hall,
at 7:00 o'clock. A most unique and satisfy-

will be presented by the classes and other
organizations both in musical and dramatical
lines. It will be remembered that in the past,

feat. The influence of Younger an
son was more in evidence in the st
displayed by the Wildcats in that game
than ever before, and the Tar Heels, sur-
prised by a devastating aerial attack in
the opening quarter, went down before
the light Davidson team for the first time
in six years,

(=

this has been-a night of nights for college
talent, and those in charge of the program
have spared no effort to make the numbers as
attractive and entertaining as possible.

The returning alumni have been requested
to register at the office of the alumni secre-
tary, in Elm Row, immediately upon arrival

| at the college, where they will be given tags

to be worn in the lapel of the coat throughout
the day. These tags will have on them the

{ Fy .
| name, class and residence of the alumnus, and

will serve to identify the alumni to each other
and to the students. This custom was initiat-
ed at the commencement exercises of last
spring, and was so successful it was decided
to continue it. All of the old men have been
notified “6f the exercises prepared for them
through circular letters.

The Y quartet has been formed and
will make an all-day deputation to Hope-
well Church next Sunday. It has been
planned for the quartet to take a large
part in Dr, Vander Meulen’s services,
and various meetings of that type. A
brass sextette has also been organized by
Pya@j. Cullum, and this is rapidly aiding
work 6éf the Y in spreading to dif-
erent fields of endeavor.
