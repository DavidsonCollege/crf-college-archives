Student Art Displays Vitality, Variety In Showing

By MATT MORRIS

This year’s student art show
stands as one of the College’s
finest ever. Rarely will you see a
better collection of student art and
in so many different mediums—
intaglio, prints and, of course,
painting are all demonstrated here
to exciting effect. If someone
wanted to make a 1930s movie
poster about this show they might
accurately call it an “avalanche of
art” or a “painter’s paradise.”

The display is packed with in-
teresting  explorations—among
my favorites (not in any particular
order here) include a conté crayon
triptych by Jean Webb, set in
some strange George Toober
space; Barry Elledge’s delight-
fully abstract piece, filled with
sneaky words and what appear to
be large, expressive pieces of
fruit; Frederick Horlbeck’s eerie
delicate etching, “Woman and
Birds,” which looks like a scene
out of some ancient German hor-
ror film; Mary Nix’s funky self-
portrait done with a masterly pen-
cil and photo-realist eye; Bill Har-
mon’s clunky, rhythmic forms; a
very erotic spray-paint by Mark
Whalen; and a touching, hilarious

portrait by Nancy Barber of what
appears to be a regular at the Par 4,
all add up toa visual feast compar-
able to a visit to Morrison’s
Cafeteria—solid, dependable
and, while no dazzler, ultimately
pleasing.

Jennifer Haithcock, Katrina
Lammers and Ken Pooley strike
out into even richer territory and
their images go beyond the other
pieces—Pooley’s small works,
done on unassuming bits of wood
have a rich texture and electric
colors that come slowly to the pa-
tient viewer. Pooley’s ability has
clearly improved and these new
works suggest a moody, complex
emotion worth experiencing again
and again. File Katrina Lammers
under the “improved and going
places” category as well—last
yuear’s prize winner. Lammers
was justly awarded once again for
her new painting, a large piece
that plays with huge shapes of
pure, imaginative color, while
avoiding the syrup and sentimen-
tality one comes to expect of most
“‘Neo-Matisse” artists. It’s a dy-
namic painting—as effortless as it
is deliberate.

Jennifer Haithcock seems to
have come out of nowhere in “the
world of art” and her canvases are
the real surprise in this show.
Haithcock’s rhythmic, Rubens-
flabby women contort and twist in

a manner that is hard to label—al-
ternatingly innocent, _ erotic,
primitive and _ psychological,
Haithcock shows a true under-
standing of form and color (also
the use of scraping) and these are

Jennifer Haithcock’s painting

some of her first efforts! It’ Il be in-

teresting to see what she does
next, but until then, go forth to
Chambers Gallery and absorb
these images into the right side of
your head. Art’s good for you.

Black Experience’ Week Provides Mixed Films

By MATT MORRIS

Whether you are aware of it or
not, Fine Films has held a “Black
Experience” week and thus far,
from “black” movies, including
Patch of Blue (1965), The Auto-
biography of Miss Jane Pittman
(1975), Claudine (1974) and Nor-
man Jewison’s In The Heat of the
Night (1967) have been screened.
Tonight, we can look forward to
the series’ grand finale Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner? Or can
we? The fact that three out of the
five movies shown star Sidney

Poitier, or maybe more impor-
tantly, none of the films shown are
directed by black filmmakers
ought to tell you something. Yes,
once again, for overall intent, fine
films gets an “A,” for artist qual-
ity; for creating a truly meaningful
series on the “Black Experience”
this critic gives those nice people
from the Union a C-plus. The
problem with almost all the
movies shown is that they are in
effect “white people’s black
movies”—none of the films, as
said before, were actually created

Tempest Provides Magic

By SCOTT McKINNEY
Productions of Shakespeare
present special problems. First,
you must have 20 or 30 actors
competent enough to deliver lines
that are sometimes difficult to
even read. Secondly, stage and
costume design must be dealt with
in certain confines while also
being original. The Davidson Col-
lege Drama Departments’ spring
major production of The Tempest
provides healthy portions of both
to make it magical in its own right.
Joe Gardner’s set and costume
design complement solid perfor-
mances (many of them first time)
from a well-rehearsed company.
Gardner uses shapes, mechanical
gadgetry, and carefully crafted
costumes as a background for
Prospero’s wizardry. The stage is
light and airy, not heavy and stale.
Like a musical ensemble, a
company of actors in a play should
work as a group; complementing
one another like pieces of a puz-

zle. In The Tempest, the pieces tit.
There are no show-stealing per-
formances here. Instead we can
delight in good performances
from top to bottom. From John
Marks powerful yet refreshingly
human Prospero, to the tightly
choreographed nymphs, we hear
well-delivered lines and pre-
cisely-placed steps. Maxine
Curry, in her Davidson debut,
works nicely as the innocent
Miranda, while Laura Pell’s
Turnburke gives Prospero’s en-
slaved spirit Ariel a bouncy, mag-
ical quality that gives you the im-
pression she can control the un-
knowing with the snap of a finger.

I could ramble for at least two
more pages on all the good perfor-
mances, all the wonderful aspects
of the set and costumes, and all the
little things that make The Tem-
pest worth seeing. But all I really
need to say, is nice acting, nice di-
rection and production, and most
of all, nice magic.

by a black. Instead, we are given
“Hollywood liberalism”—the
bright inventive black who helps a
blind girl; the bright inventive
black who solves a murder, or as
in tonight’s case, the bright inven-
tive black who falls in love with a
white girl. Sidney Poitier is a fine
actor capable of excellent perfor-
mances, but only /n The Heat of
the Night rises above a ‘self-im-
portant’ level—Patch of Blue is an
interesting weeper with a remark-
able performance by Shelley Win-
ters but remains a small low
budgeter and does not really fit
into the series as a whole; The Au-
tobiography of Miss Jane Pittman
reeks of TV movie marathon pom-
posity; Claudine has a spotty belly
laugh appeal with one truly hilari-
ous moment involving a S-year-
old and Tarzan, Lord of the
Jungle, and tonight’s offering

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?
is passable Stanley Kramer goo
goo muck redeemed by a brilliant
Spencer Tracy soliloquy, but the
fact remains that all of these films
are white, white, white. If Fine
Films really wanted to do Black
filmmaking justice, why didn’t
they include any of Gordon Parks’
classic movies? Or how about
Sweet Sweetback’s Baaadass
Song by the extremely gifted Mel-
vin Van Peebles? Both of these di-
rector films, often savagely pow-
erful accounts of what it is to be
black, deserve attention and
would have fit perfectly into a
“Black Experience” film week,
but instead, apathetic Davidson
(as David Resnik so aptly put it) is

given white schlock art that pre- .

tends to be important.
However, the series is not a
complete failure (C-plus) and last

night’s film, /n The Heat of the
Night remain, the true gem of the
lot. A bigoted cop (Rod Steiger)
reluctantly joins forces with Sid-
ney Poitier and they both become
involved in a moody, suspenseful
mystery that not only excites, but
explores black/white relations.
Heat probably made a bigger im-
port in the racially chaotic 60s
than it does today but its com-
ments on human relations and
brotherhood are loud and clear,
and the Quincy Jones backup
score ain’t bad either.

So there you have it—a mixed
bag of movies this week.. Let’s
just hope that next time someone
gets a great idea from a film series
they don’t blow it on commer-
cialism. Movies are too important
to play around with that way.

Stuart Speaks At Convocation

By LAUREN SMITH

When I read in an announce-
ment that Dabney would be in
Davidson on April 26th to speak at
convocation and to read his
poetry, I asked some of my pro-
fessors about him. “He graduated
from Davidson,” they said. “You
should read some of his poetry.”
Then, sometimes, they chuckled
and told me a story. Each person
had a slightly different version, so
when I was asked to write this arti-
cle, I called C. Shaw Smith to get
his account.

Dabney Stuart was a senior at
Davidson in 1960. He was Phi
Beta Kappa and a member of the

Beta fraternity. At graduation he
gave the Valedictorian address.
“It was such a shock,” said Shaw.
Stuart went to the podium and said
simply, “I cannot improve on
what Jesus said, ‘Love your
neighbor.’” Then he sat down. It
was the last Valedictorian address
at Davidson College.

Since his graduation Stuart
has attended Harvard as a Wood-
row Wilson Scholar, and has been
awarded the Howard Willet Prize,
the Dylan Thomas Award of the
Poetry Society of America, and a
grant from the National Founda-
tion on the Arts and Humanities.
His volumes of poetry include

Found and Round, A Particular
Place, and Common Ground. He
is now teaching at Washington
and Lee University in Lexington,
Virginia.

As you are reading this article,
you will already have had the op-
portunity to hear Stuart speak at
convocation Friday morning, and
read his poetry Friday afternoon.
As I talked to Shaw Smith, how-
ever, and as I write this article,
Dabney Stuart’s arrival at David-
son is in the future. “Well,” said
Shaw over the telephone, and he
laughed, “I look forward to hear-
ing him speak.” So do I.
