The idea of using Byrne’s music
for a dance production was an in-
spired one; its intricate polyrhythms
make it éminently suitable for this
sort of treatment. Byrne’s music and
Tharp’s choreography share another

attribute which makes them particu-

larly complementary of one another:

ground for this ‘current review,
which, of course, must deal simply
with the recorded portion of “The
Catherine Wheel.” Without its visual
aspect, “The Catherine Wheel”
stands on its own as one of the most
enjoyable collections of music ever
released upon the popular market. It
is an infectious and imaginative work
which constantly explores new fronti-
ers of sound. Hearing the score makes
one hunger to see the dancing which it
is meant to accompany, but it is easy
to imagine the sort of movement such
urgent music might impel.

While the album jacket lists a
“cast” (mostly members of.a typical
household), only a quarter of “Cathe-
rine’s”. score contains lyrics, and
these are sung by Byrne himself rath-

for the modern family, in which the

“The Catherine Wheel”. plus a few in-

the album, it is more readily accessi-
ble to a mass audience, and contains a
larger proportion of material similar
to pre-“Remain in Light” Talking

ly does it contain some of the most in-
triguing music. from “The Catherine
Wheel,” but it also creates.a more af-
fecting aura due to a better balance of
vocal and instrumental selections. In
the context of the entire score, which
concludes in the same way as the con-
densed version, the relatively
straight-forward finale is .purging
rather than disappointing.

“The Catherine Wheel’s” limited
run on Broadway denied most of us
the opportunity to experience the
work in its complete manifestation.
Perhaps it will eventually be per-
formed on tour by-the Twyla Tharp
Dance Company, or filmed for pos-
terity and/or wider distribution. In the
meantime, at least we have this wond-
erful aural document of a unique mi-
lestone in the history of modern
dance.
