Roanoke Defeats
Davidson In Debate

Wins Two to One Decision Over
Davidson Team.

Davidson matched her debating team
with Roanoke’s on the platform at
Salem, Virginia, last Friday night. The
subject of the debate was: “Resolved,
That the United States should adopt
system of compulsory military service..’

Messrs. W. C. Robinson and O. F.
Blackwelder, of Roanoke, upheld the
affirmative; R. H. Ratchford and J. A.
Thames, of Davidson, the negative. “The
judges rendered a decision two to one in
favor of Roanoke.

Mr. Robinson, of Roanoke, opened
the debate. He showed how inadequate
our present army is for our defense. He
argued that our volunteer system had
fallen down in the past and that we had
suffered greatly by using untrained sol-
diers. He also contended that our navy
was inefficient, poorly equipped, and
slow, and that we had a ten thousand
mile coast practically undefended.

Mr. R. H. Ratchford was the first
speaker on the negative for Davidson.
He showed that compulsory service was
incompatable with American ideals, and
that it was militaristic in tendency,
eventually leading to militarism. “Ihat
it was undemocratic in its very nature.
He refuted the argument of the affirma-
tive that compulsory sérvice would be
democratic because it would be universal
and affected everyone alike, by saying
that to imprison everybody would be
universal, but would nor be democratic.
He said that Germany had this system,
that everyone bore the same burdens and
obeyed the same orders, therefore Ger-
many was an ideal democracy according
to his opponent's argument. He also
showed how our volunteer system had
won every war in the past.

Mr. Blackwelder was the second and
last speaker for Roanoke. He argued
that service in the army would make the
American youth more obedient and law-
abiding, that it would make them more
patriotic and give them a broader view,
at the same time giving them good phy-
sical training. He argued that compul-
sory service in the United States would
he democratic because the orders would
come from the people and not from a
Kaiser. as in Germany. He closed by
asserting that Great Britain had the
“compulsory system,” and Germany the
“volunteer system.” His speech was
marked by fine oratory and sarcasm.

Mr. ‘Thames closed the debate for
Davidson. He overwhelmed his oppon-
ents with facts, logic and sarcasm, taking
up their own statements and turning the
tables on them. He contended that the
affirmative had to show that we needed
a powerful army all the time for our
safety, before they could prove their side.
He showed how difficult it was for any
nation to land and equip an army across
the ocean. That England had not land-
ed a single soldier on German soil in
spite of the fact that her navy was four
times superior to Germany’s, and that
Germany, with her powerful navy, had
not landed a single soldier on Russian
soil. He also pointed out the slowness
of. the Gallipoli, Salonica expeditions.
Then he asked the question if any Ger-
man professor could invent a powder

Davidson won the second game ot the
past week by defeating Wake Forest on
Sprunt Field here on Wednesday atter
noon by a 3-1 score. The game was
slow but interesting. In the carly stages
of the game Wake Forest secured a one
run lead, but in the seventh Davidson
came back strong by scoring all thice of
her runs. With Miller on base K.esier
singled, scoring him. Keesler then stole
second. At this point Hengeveld pro
ceeded to win his own game with a drive
to center field, which he managed to
stretch into a home run, scoring Keesler
ahead of him.

One of the prettiest fielding features
of the game was a catch of a foul fly
by Legget in the seventh, the player fall
ing over the visitors’ bench in making
the catch, but retaining the ball, Fu

In one of the fastest and most interest
ing games staged on the Hill this season
‘Trinity and Davidson struggled to a uc
last Friday afternoon, “Phe game was
held up until 4:30 o'clock on acchnal6t
threatening rain, and at that time, the
weather looking favorable, the game was
begun.

The Red and Black swatters took a
lead in the first inning when by a series
of walks and hits they put three runs
across to their credit. In the fourth in-
ning ‘Trinity came in strong, bunching
several beautiful hits and scoring three
runs, tieing the score. “There was con-
siderable hitting on both sides, besides
the bunching that resulted in the 3 to 3
score, but all were sufficiently scattered
to not allow any additional runs. Both
teams threatened to score after the
fourth inning, but the extra tap could
not be made.

The game was called off after the
seventh inning on account of darkness.

In the individual starring list may be
placed Beal, first-baseman for Trinity.
He played a good game at first, and his
hitting was spectacular. The pitching
on both sides was good, both striking out
8 men each. and keeping the hits well
scattered. Box-score:
