Defeated in Six Encounters

Overwhelming Scores

To date the showing of the Davidson var-

encouraging, having met defeat in all of their

The Charlotte “Y", Furman, |
North Carolina, Duke, and Erskine all boast |
Victories over the local quint, with the first |
named team having two wins to their credit. |

In the opening fracas the Linkmen of
Charlotte “Y” tripped “Flake” Laird’s 1933
model Wildcat basketeers on the local floor
37 to 27, The game was fast and interesting
with the “Y” leading 14 to 9 at the half. |
Edwards of Charlotte was high scorer of the
game with eleven points, while Peabody and
Harris each garnered seven to top Davidson’s
scorers.

Charlotte ‘Y” 37; Davidson 29

In a return game with the lads from the
Charlotte “Y” the ’Cats again suffered de-
feat, but showed improvement. The second
game was almost a repetition of the first
one, and the Linkmen bagged the contest by
37 to 29, Up until half time, Davidson was

Many Davidson students and alumni
were greatly disappointed by the action
taken by the Southern Conference in its
recent meeting at Richmond, Va., in not
admitting Davidson into its membership.
Many thought Davidson’s chances of
getting into the Conference would be
great, especially since the split was ef-
fected, but once again things looked
different when the group decided to limit
its membership to the ten colleges al-
ready entered.

There will be no reason for disappoint-
ment when you consider the circumstances
which influenced the decision of that body.
One of the~chief-reasons the split in the
old-Southern Conference was effected is that |
the body was too large. There were twenty-
three teams in it. At the Richmond meeting,
the first of the group as a new conference,
no less than seven colleges made application
for membership. The conference would not |
have benefitted a great deal by the split if
it had admitted the seven schools.

ference did the most logical thing and flatly | barrage
| markers.

refused membership to any of the appli-

cants.

Had there been only three, or possibly
four applicants for membership, we ac-
tually believe that the conference would
have admitted the schools and increased
its membership to thirteen or fourteen
colleges. But we hardly believe that it
will ever allow itself to grow into a 17-
college, or greater, conference again.

At the Richmond meeting, the conference
did not definitely
ten schools, but rather indicated that the
limit would be expanded, .A committee of
three was appointed to make recommenda-
tions by-September Ist for any college which
might be admitted at that time. That Da-
vidson stands a good chance of being rec-
ommended by the committee is not in the
least doubtful. We base our opinion upon
the fact that the Southern Conference re-
cently tightened its scholastic requirements
for athletes, until the new rules approach
the regulations which have been in effect
here at Davidson from times remote from
our memories., A committee which finds a
school that has had for some time regula-

Once David is ded be-
fore the body, we do not believe that
members of it will deny her admittance.

Led by the uncanny shooting of Nau, who
garnered twenty points during the fray, they
were considerably better than the Wildcats.

Harris led the Davidson contingent with

North Carolina 56; Davidson 18

Carolina, led by Aitken and Weathers, All-
Southern players, completely routed the
Wildcat pentagon in Charlotte by the oyer-
whelming score of 56-18. The score at half
time was 36 to 9, and at no time did David-
son threaten the Tar Heels. Harris of Da-
vidson was high scorer of the evening, close-
followed by Weathers and Aitken, who
took in eleven apiece.

Duke 58; Davidson 14

Close on the heels of the lacing given
them by North Carolina, the Davidson five
was knocked into a cocked hat by an espe-
strong aggregation from Durham,
wearing the colors of Duke University, by]
the one-sided score of 58 to 14. The game
belonged to the Blue Devils all the way
through, and at no time did the Wildcats

In the last contest before the ’Cats took
to their lair for a ten-day period of exams,
they were nosed out by a fighting crowd

from the Southern Conference, surely
they would refuse to allow their athletic
teams to meet those from Davidson.

namely Erskine College, by a 33 to 32 ver-

finish, no great margin separating the teams
at any time, and the lead constantly shifting.
Paker’s unerring. eye put Erskine in the win
column, and made him high scorer of the
game with twelve points, followed by Cap-
tain Peabody of Davidson with ten.

Answer First Call Monday

Last Monday Coach “Doc” Newton called
all candidates for the 1933 varsity Davidson
football team to come out for spring foot-
ball. Forty-five promising candidates an-
swered the call,.4nd this crowd was much
larger than the coaches had anticipated.

Uniforms have been issued and light work-
outs have been given the players. Signal
practice, blocking, fundamentals, of offensive
and defensive technique have been given the
players with harder work to come later. The
workouts have been naturally short, due to

basketball for the first time last year with | the fact that supper has been at 6:00 P. M.

’Cats Leave to Meet
South Carolina Foes

Coach Laird and his Wildcat basketeers
will leave January 30th for a two-day trip
in South Carolina. They go first to Green-
ville, where Furmain will be the foe, then
on the night of the 3lst, it will be Wofford
at Spartanburg.

The Wofford quintet is now. leading the
race for championship honors in South Car-
olina, and even though Furman stands fourth
they have an excellent five. These will both
be tough foes. Coach Laird says, however,
that, his are rapidly improving, and
should be in good shape for their Palmetto
trip.

A graduate of Davidson and of Union studying abroad’ writes:

“There are able scholars here whose _books..are.known-and.read....
all over the religious world. None of them can surpass some of our
professors at Union as teachers, and none of them can challenge a
student to joyous, practical Christianity as did our professors there.”
