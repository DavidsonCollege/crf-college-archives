BLUE RIDGE CONFERENCE TO
LAST FROM JUNE 13 TO 23

The time of year has again come
around when we are thinking about the
Blue Ridge conference. Every fellow
who can possibly make the trip should
seriously consider doing it for Blue
Ridge is undoubtedly one of the finest
student conference grounds in America.
Any student who has the opportunity
ot spending ten days there will find it
more valuable than any one year of his
college career. The influence of the
student conference upon the leadership
and thought in Christian and educational
fields is beyond measure.

Last year there were present 136 pro-
fessors, ministers and secretaries; 101
preparatory students and 367 college
men, including a number of foreign stu-
dents. They represented 54 colleges and
universities and 14 preparatory schools.
Oi the 604 delegates, 105 were Baptists,
108 Presbyterian, 155 Methodists and
236 belonging to various other denomina-
tions. Those who were there will ever
remember the stirring addresses and the
rich fellowship and wholesome recrea-
tion of the conference of 1921.

This year’s program should prove to
be one of the strongest in the history of
Blue Ridge conferences.

This conference will last from June
13th to June 23d. The expenses, aside
from railroad fare, are $5 for the pro-
gram fee and $25 for board and room.
Davidson will no doubt be well repre-
sented.

D.
VACANCIES ON “Y” BOARD
OF CONTROL ARE FILLED

The election of those to fill the vacant
places on the Y. M. C. A. Board of Con-
trol was recently held at a meeting of
the student body. Prof. F. K. Fleagle
from the faculty, G. B. Sorrells from the
Junior class, and ‘M. D. Field and A. M.
McBryde from the Sophomore class,
were chosen to fill these positions. These
men will guide the financial affairs of
the “Y” for the coming year.

T).

VOLUNTEER BAND APPOINTS
OFFICERS FOR COMING YEAR

Last Sunday morning the Volunteer
Band elected officers. The following
men were chosen to lead the band next
year: Guy Weeks, president; Ted Jones,
vice-president; Victor Hoye, secretary,
and M. P. Calhoun, treasurer.

After the election, Angus McBryde
talked on the need of going into ath-

“letics from the standpoint of getting in-
to personal touch with fellow-students.
T).

PANDEINIC OFFICERS FOR
NEW TERM ARE INSTALLED

On Thursday night the Pandeinic So-
ciety installed its officers for the term
which runs through the balance of this
term and until November of the fall
term, These officers are: President,
Arnett Gamble; vice-president, Perrin
Hudgin; secretary, Harry Price; first
critic, Bascom Sorrells; treasurer, Wil-
liam Baker; sergeant-at-arms, Raymond
Oeland.

J. C. Bailey as acting president con-
ducted the installation service, after
‘which the new président gave a short
inaugural address. In this he urged the
members to seek the standards contain-
ed in the old saying that reading makes
a full man, writing an exact man, and
speaking a ready man, and to never be
satisfied to be mediocre men. The new
officers express their intention to keep
up and carry to greater heights the fine
work this new society has done since its

beginning last fall.
T).

In a recent issue of the Davidsonian
the list of student body officers for thie
coming year was carried, but due. to &@
reporter’s error there was a mistake if
the name of the secretary and treasurer.
This place will be held by H. B. Price,
of the Class of '25.

C. E. TRAINING CLASS
HAS A PROSPEROUS YEAR

The Christian Endeavor Training Class
has made wonderful progress during the
last year under the direction of W. A.
Gamble. A summary of the work done
and the organization of the class into
committees will be of interest to many
at this time.

They have added much to the success
of the Wednesday night Bible classes
under the leadership of T. I. Fraser,
general chairman. P. H. Biddle and W.
R Kretchmar, committee ort’léaders’ at-
tendance, have been largely responsible
for the good work done by the leaders
in their classes. J. M. Carr, H. M. Wells,
and C. C. McMillen haye been on the job
regularly putting up posters and adver-
tising the classes.

A committee on attendance consisting
of T. A. Guiton, A. M. Martin, and P. B
Freeland have been successful in helping
to get the boys out at each meeting.

The deputations have been in the
hands of J. L. McLean, who is now in
correspondence with several points.

The secretary of the Southwest C. E.
Union, at Dallas, Tex., wrote the cther
day to know of the workings of the
class.

The Endeavorers feel that the year has
been a most interesting and successful
ene, and are looking forward to a great-
er work in the coming year at Davidson.

ference of the young people of the Pres-
