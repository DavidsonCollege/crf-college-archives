Social System Floundering;
Freshman Interest Waning

AN ANALYSIS

By TODD EADES
Staff Writer
The plan of the new

for freshmen is no

social
system
functioning as well as it was
envisioned.

Many freshmen have stopped
going down to the social houses
and one freshmen dorm has or.
ganized a social council.

The problem ts that freshmen

are mot eating at the houses
and are no: participating in the
Dean of Students
Will Terry says. “Things
just drifting.”

Few reports of hostility to-
wards the visiting freshmen
have been voiced. But apathy
on the part of the houses has
been widespread and this dis-
courages returning to the house.

Some freshmen prefer eating
at the Union to eating on the
court because they feel the food

social life.

Other houses have had mem-

participate in house activities.

Terry has met with interested
freshmen and with hall coun-
selors, and plans to meet in the
fu'ure with house presidents.
Then representatives of these

A possible plan is to have

house. later in the term, after
kee parties to acquaint fresh-
men with the houses, and then
allowing self selection.

Another plan is to shorten the
tune a freshmen eats at one
house from five weeks to two
or three weeks, to allow him
to experience more houses.

What is being sought is a
