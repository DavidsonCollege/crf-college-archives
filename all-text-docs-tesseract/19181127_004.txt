“¥” SERVICE ATTENDANCE
WAS RECORD BREAKING

The sorrow of the student body at
losing Mr. Moore, the “Y” secretary,
was shown by the record breaking at-
tendance at Shearer Hall last Sunday
night. During the two months — that
Mr. Moore has been at Davidson, he
has won the admiration and respect of
the boys completely. His sympathy with
those in trouble, his fairness as a referee,
and his Christian spirit all combined to
make him a man among men. It is in-
deed with sorrow that the college sees
him leave, for a man of his calibre is
not often found.

After the preliminary song. service and

reading, Mr. Moore made his final talk
to the student body. He took as his
subject’ the advice ‘of Paul to the Co-
rinthians: “Watch, stand firm in’ the
faith, play the man, be strong.” Watch-
fulness, said Mr. Moore, is one of the
most important duties of a soldier. Lack
of watchfulness while on the post of duty
is punished by the supreme penalty—
death. ‘Vhe fate of his comrade, the de-
cision of a whole battle, may rest on the
watchfulness of the sentitiel. And so it
is in the spiritual fight. Unless we keep
watchful, the enemy is likely to steal in
on us. unaware and overpower us. “Po
stand fast in the faith is an injunction
especially needed now by men in col-
leges, when there are so many tenden-
cies to draw away from the simple faith
of Christ. - Materialism, the “I should
worry” philosophy, and many others are
striving to undermine Christianity, But
Paul dees ‘not by this mean one ta he a
religious fanatic. He tells us to play
the man, to be a man four square, and
not a freak. Don’t play the fool, but
play the game fairly and squarely,
whether it is easy or not, All the ad-
vices of Paul are summed up in his
final command—“be strong.” He means
by this, mental strength, not physical.
Paul was a weak man physically, bur-
dened with infirmities, but he was men-
tally one of the most powerful charac-
ters of his age.
, Mr. Moore closed with the hope that
those present would remember — these
four commands of Paul, and endeavor to
carry them out.

DEATH OF MRS. McMILLAN
SADDENS STUDENT BODY

The Davidson townspeople and old
students were saddened on Tuesday,. No-
vember 19, by news of the death of Mrs.
Sallie Thornburg McMillan. Mrs.

and she entered the Presbyterian Hos-
pital for treatment, where she remained
until the end.

Mrs, McMillan came to Davidson in
the fall of 1915. During her stay here
she won many friends. because of her
splendid Christian character. During
the last two years of her stay here she
kept Dr. Shearer’s house, and won the
esteem of all by the care and faithful-
ness with which she attended him.
While here she kept a boarding house,
and became very popular among the stu-
dents. She was always willing to help
in any way possible to give the boys a
good time. Many banquets and socials
owed their success to Mrs, McMillan’s

work, much of which was done at an

inconvenience to herself,

Besides her husband, Mrs. McMillan
is survived by four children and two
sisters: Miss Jean McMillan. Alex-
ander, Robert, Harold. Mrs. T. N.
Smith, of Davidsone and Mrs. Wright,

Does Not Keep Us From Delivering

morning just before “Reveille. “We
might not hear Bitzer's bugle.” “This
fear, coupled with the knowledge that
an inspection would possibly be made at
Reveille for flaws in dressing, was the
inspiration prompting the setting of, the
clocks. — But by the extensive practice
of the night before, the extra time was
not needed, despite the fact that some
fingers were ‘all thumbs” and a com-
plex pile of strings, canvas and khaki by
the bunks.

After the Saturday's inspection was
accounted for and the week ended. Sun-
day afternoon. gave promise of numerous
cameras and kadoks carrying out once
more their functions. How many moth-
ers and “cousins” will get snapshorts
shortly? A few really had themselves
snapped at “port arms” and “right
shoulder arms;" but most were taken
“without” rifles. How vain is man!

By the time this is read the novelty
will have worn off and the men will be
brillantly arrayed in all the glamour of
a Sammie’s uniform, and, tho not as
gorgeous as some soldier of the — far
Orient, will -present a striking appear-
ance of uniformity.

A word of description would not be
amiss: This lot, the first ‘issued, is a
cotton affair of two shirts, a blouse and
one pair of breeches, besides three pairs
of woolen socks, two suits of woolen un-
derwear, one pair of canviiss leggings
(the kind known best as “rabbit hunt-
ing’) and one hat and belt. Strange to
say, every man drew a fit in the belt.
The shoes are expected shortly, as are
the overcoats, hat cords, insignia and
woolen uniforms,

It is true we have been soldiers since
the first of October, and the fact that
the uniforms were so late in getting here
is generally well understood. The in-
ability of factories to put out their regu-
lar amount of work as well as other un-
avoidable delays naturally resulting in
such a time of stress. But now that at
last we have “them,” it should be the
final exhortation to a soldier’s duties, for
besides branding a man as “FE. Pluribus
Unum” it should be a source of pride to
him.

Auburn, and was, when the war broke
out, pursuing a theological course in the
University of Emory. We are glad to
have Mr, Rutland, and shall endeavor
to co-operate with him in all ways pos-
sible.

PAY ROLL SIGNED.

Monday and Tuesday were days of
more anticipated joy. The men again
signed the pay roll for their thirty per
for the month of November. The actual
cash will be handed out any time be-
tween now and Christmas. Anticipa-
tion, however, is the best part of an ac-
quisition anyway—TI don’t think.
