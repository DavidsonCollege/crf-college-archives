.

Freshman Regulations have
accomplished something this.
year: In spite of the lack of
the usual water fights and
only one abortive attempt
to burn the beanies, the
freshmen have shown’ an
unusual amount. of class
unity for this short period
of time. This fact can be
traced to only one source,
John Barrow. Freshman Ad-
visor.

Barrow has been .praised by
upperclassmen and freshmen
alike for his administration of
the Freshman Court. his or
ganization and planning of the
Field Day, the publicity of all
Freshman events, and the in-
stitution of the Joe Jones Award.
Most of the praise was directed
towards the ingenuity with
which justice was handed out
by the court.

The. Joe Jones Award prob-
ably caused more .controversy
among the freshmen than any
other measure instituted by Bat-
row. Jesse Sims. the evident
avinner of this award, has been
the victim of a smear campaign
by the freshmen.

Signs have been appearing on
campus with passionate pleas to

Three Fall Retreats

Planed For Students

In a continuing effort to instill new life into the
Davidson religious atmosphere, three retreats will be,

sponsored Oct. 24-25 by campus organizations.

Each retreat has been or-
ganized around a_ different
theme and all will be open to
any interested student. Student
leaders stress that diversity
is being offered rather than
competition among the groups.
Faculty members have been ten.
tatively invited.

The Westminister Fellowship
will hold its retgeat in Montreat
attempting tytreate a subjec-
tive religious” atmosphere in
contrast to the usual intellec-
tual emphasis on campus, .ac-
cording to president Charles
Raynal.

Experiments in worship and
meditation will be mixed with
liberal portions of free time for
social activities with the

Frosh Council Shape
Program For Future

Freshman Council has under-
taken several projects during
first weeks. of the ‘school, year
and plans to ‘remain active
througr out the year in many
areas.”’ according to John Bar-
row. Fresman Advisor.

The annual Freshman Sopho-
more Field Day. the group's
first undertaking, was executed
by the Planning. Prblicity. and
Personnel ‘Committees appoint:
ed by the Council. The Plan-
ning and Publicity Committees
were also responsible for organ-
izing the recent mixer with the
Converse College freshmen.

Regarding plans for the near

Music Convocation

ally recognized American com-
poser of organ and church mu-
sic, will be the guest lecturer

Stigall. guest organist: and stud-
ent organists of Davidson Col-

future Barrow commented,
‘Parents Day is the only thing
that the council is required to
do, but a Special Projects Com-
mittee is investigating the possi-
bility of future activities.”
Freshmen Parents Day. sched-
wled for Nov. 7, will. be under
the direction of the council's
Steering Committee.

Barrow, who is. serving as
moderator until a president is
elected by the council after the
first grading period, remarked.
“The members have shown an
unusual amount of enthusiasm
and seem to be willing to work
in making the organization do
a good job in representing the
freshmen.”

The members of the council,
elected by their classmates, are
the following: Harry McMullen,
Bruce Vanderbloemen, Paul
Monk, Tom Pope, Ben Cannon,
Gary Pekio, Dan Sweet. Mark
Brown, Frank Powell, Bo Per-
ty. Mike Mooty. Lyle Smith,

Queens WF, Raynal explained.
He urges anyone interested to
contact. him immediately, as
only a limited number may go.

Rufus Hallmark is directing a
YMCA - sponsored retreat to
Camp Stewart near Charlotte,
centering on the relation be-
tween aesthetics and religion.
“Discussion about the reli-
gious overtones ox painting,
music, dance, poetry and drama
will be included, as well as
participation in worship
through different artistic
media,” Hallmark said.

An invitation has been ex-
tended to participants from
Salem College but a reply is
pending.

“The retreat will aim for some
continuity with the variety of
worship services being  oc-
casionally here during Wed-
nesday chapel period,” com-
mented Bill Rule, YMCA Spirit-
ual Life chairman. '

The Methodist Student Fel-
lowship, led by Decker Faw,
will examine the rélation of
ethics of. business and Christian-
ity, at a Lake Junaluska Con-
ference.

The inimitable Dr. Ernie Pat.
terson and a well-known indus-
trialist will lead discussion on
the “paradoxical ethics of to-
day's businessman,” Faw noted.
“The theme, ‘The Nonsense of
Christianity in the Business
World, suggests that.there can
be no Christian commitment in
the business world, for to em-
brace such a radical message
involves certain, financial
suicide,” Faw commented.

“The santitiy of the profit
motive claims the reverence of
man. Whether or not the Chris-
tian claim has any future, will
likely be questioned within this
framework,” he added.

Rule urges that all interested
Students contact the respective
leaders at once. In general,
gtoups will leave Saturday after
lunch and return late Sunday
afternoon. A maximum charge
of two dollars per person is ex.
pected. ‘

T. Kimbrough are presently
studying the proposal for the
store and how it might be fit-
ted into the over-all Student
Store structure.

As it is now being proposd
and discussed, the used-book
store would operate purely as
a business enterprise. Instead
of having students set their
own prices and hope or buy-
ers, the store would buy used
books from students, add a cer-

tain percentage for overhead, |
and then sei] them at new.

And when you think of CAMPUS CLOTHES —

Remember Patrich (sic) Hen-

ry!"
It might interest some fresh-
men to know that Jesse is col-

| lecting these signs and is cover-

ing the walls of his room with
them, He plans to-save them and
show them to his grandchildren.

Jesse, not wishing to be .con-
sidered a campus maniac. but
rather more of a Dutch uncle
to the freshmen. says that it
#s for the good. of the freshmen
that he is doing this.

As one upper classman put
it. “You can’t just tell a bunch

of freshmen that this is David- —

son College and that it is theirs.
You have to make them realize
that they are not yet a part of
the college in spirit: they're
still a part in name only. They
may. be ‘the best freshman class
ever,” but they still haven't
proved that they belong here.”

Taking time off from their
usual pastime of killing rats
and ants, the fourth floor of
Watts seems to be the base for
most of the threats and the
anti-Sims plots. Sims feels this
special attention showered upon
him by the freshman class is
undeserved.

Although the freshman class
was too sophisticated this year
to resort to water fights and
beanie burnings, they must be
grudgifgly praised for the am-
bition shown in the. signs and
for the newly developed method
of rebelling against freshman
regulations—passive resistance.

Chaplain Will Terry, comment-
ing on the topic, stated that
Golden recently has given this
same talk at Oberlin College
into Ohio, Terry presumed that
Golden would probably relate
his talk to the current ptesiden
tial campaign. Later during the
semester another speaker will
be brought to.Davidson by the
YMCA to speak on ‘‘What A Con-
servative Expects.”

Golden is well known through-

‘out the nation, especially in the

South, for his editorials and
books. Living in Charlotte, Gold-
en edits The Carolina Israelite,
a newspaper published six times
a year. It is composed chiefly
of serious and humorous articles
by the editor.

As an author, Golden has pro-
duced several books. Only tn
Americs, a series of short es-
says is his mast famous book.
He has also written the best-
seller For 2 Cents Plain and
Enjoy, Enjoy. As a biograph-
er, Golden wrote Carl Sandburg,
and recently Mr. Kennedy and
the Negroes.

A well-traveled man, Golden
has spoken all over the nation,

and often has had more speak-
ing engagements than he could

A crusader. Golden has fought
against censorship of books and
movies. In his speeches, edi-
torials, and other writings he
picks to pieces many of man's
prejudices.

In his previous visits to Dav-
idson, Golden has spoken on a
variety of topics. Several years
ago he talked to a chapel audi-
ence about the ‘Industrial
South.” More recently. in a

Crowds of listeners have always
marked his visits to the campus,
whether at required chapel pro-
grams or at informal coffee
hours and disccussions.

Golden has always been well-
received by Davidson audiences,
even though they often don't
support his particular viewpoint.
C. Shaw Smith. director of stud-
ent activities, who has heard
Golden speak numerous times
commented, “You can’t ignore
him, even if you don't agree
with what he is saying. He will
slip up on your blind side, and
shake your mind into thinking
about what he is saying.”

A true showman, Golden is
very likeable and very open. He
has many friends at Davidson.
and once commented that he
would walk to Davidson to speak
if need be.

A coffee hour in the Morrison
Room of the Union will conclude
Golden's visit to the campus.
