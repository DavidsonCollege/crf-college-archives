Not that I’m the vindictive
type. but a wrong has been
done, and since it was done to
me, who better to right it?
Some saboteur in the pay of the
forces of reason mislabeled my
coulmn of two weeks ago.

The title, befiting the tone of
my little offering, should have
heen “‘The Adventures of Mott
the Wopple: The Quest Begins.”
Let not the Enemy befuddle you
again, then, for, regardless of
what it Says up there (see
above), this week's title is ‘‘The
Adventures of Mott the Wopple:
The Lay of Elroy.” Despair ye
not. All will be made clear.

To the Editor:

T don’t believe that any mem-
her of the college community
can honestly deny the continu-
ing meed that exists on this
campus for adequate and quali-
fied student counseling. A glance
at Dr. Workman’s or Dr. Hall's
appointment books will bear
this observation out.

We at Davidson have been
foriunate in having available
dur‘og the present school year
two excellent and highly quali-
fied clinical psychologists. The
counseling program is in overall
excellen: shape and has encour.
aging potential for reaching
even more students in the fu-
ture.

It is because of these observa.
ticns that I get to the point of
this letter: specifically, to deny
and dispell any sort of rumors
or reports which may be circu-
lating within the college com-
munity concerning a conflict of
interest or an alleged violation
of confidence cn the part of the
counselors.

At no time has there ever
been anv breach of faith: the
confidential nature of the inter-
views has always been religious-
lv adhered to.

Despite my good intentions, I,
too, did a wrong. A few nights
ago, Katamite Kayrat, one of
my postnight cohorts, burst into
the Helper Inn, spewing right-
eous indignation all over the
rug. My column, it seems, had
snidely remarked that the light-
ing on campus was inadequate.

Kayrat pointed out to me that
he wouldn’t have it any other
way. And I agree. God forbid
that postnight Davidson should
be whitewashed into anemia by
blinding spotlights.

Nothing is more soothing to
the pos‘night devotee than the
spectral 4 a.m. campus, rich

with shadows and speckled with
pastel oases of light. Take away
that lighting and you take away
the lives of countless postnight
inhabitants, who flit from island
to island, taking refuge in the
darkness.

Surely the most dependent of
all on the contemplative nature
of the early morning campus is
Numb Elroy. Many’s the time
Kayrat and I have sought the
comforting wisdom of that ghost-
ly seer.

Numb Elroy sits on top of the
defunc: water fountain beside
Phi Hall. He's always there, his
palest of pale form in a weak-

Protests Rumors

I am sure that almost every
member of this community is
aware that we have at David-
son two clinical psychologists
who are men of absolute integ-
rity on both the personal and
the professional level. The ma-
licious and unfounded reports
which have been making the
rounds as of late concerning
these men is nothing short of
slander. It makes me sick to
believe that the originator of
these rumors might be a stu-
dent here at Davidson. He should
know better.

For the possible damage done
to the repu‘ation of the counsel-
ing office and perhaps to the
personal reputation of our coun-
selors, I publicly apologize.

To the Editor:

Upon recently transferring to.

West: Virginia University I had
the occasion to visit their libra-
ry to obtain some novels for my
English Literature class.

Much to my surprise there
were no books whatsoever to be
found !! Upcn lengthy inquiry
as to just where in the sam hill
the books were I was informed
that to obtain a book one had

to go to the circulation desk and
fill out a requisition slip and
one of the workers then scur-
ried off to the stacks (I sup-
pose, as I have never seen them)
to get the book.

After a twenty minute wait I
was informed that both ‘‘Crime
end Punishment” and ‘Run
Rabbit, Run” had been stolen.
The deskman then kindly sug-
gested that I buy a _ personal
copy.

Later I was told that one
must have a stacks pags to get
into the stacks to browse. To
obtain one of these stacks pass-
es one must be a professor, a
graduate student, or have a 3.0
or higher grade average.

Since it takes two semesters
to establish a grade point aver-
age at this university, I am
banned from the stacks libra-
ry!!

I am writing Dr. Davidson to
send me some addresses of
some paperback book companies
so that I can obtain a copy of a
novel to read for my English
Literature class.

Davidson is not so bad libra-
rvwise.

kneed lotus position, but the sun
all but erases him from view,
so wasted, so nearly transparent
is he. Only the thick darkness
of postnight Davidson gives him
substance.

The distinguishing feature of
Numb Elroy is that his brain is
completely disconnected from
the rest of his body. What he
sees and speaks in no way re-
flects what’s going on below his
neck. Consequently, his body is
often swollen and welt-covered
without his even knowing it.

Just last week, for example,
I was strolling with the Honor-
able Senator Roland (spelled
R-o-l-]-a-n-d ameng friends) who.
speaking of the new adminis-
tration, was just saying, ‘‘There
is coming one whose sandals I
am not fit to untie,’’ when we
passed by Numb Elrov, squat-
ting complacently upon his dried
up pedestal.

Though his eyes were bright
with awareness of our approach,
he seemed completely uncon-
scious of the spider that was
descending from the céiling
which protects the fountain from
the contaminating touch of even
rainwater. As Numb Blroy
spoke, the spider began to dan-
ce its web around his legs.

“TI rejoice to see you, wayfar-
ers.” Numb Elroy always begins
like that; he seldom sees any-

“You have stumbled upon
me in the midst of the direst
sort of academic ruminations.
which thrive in solitude.”

As he spoke, the spider thread-
ed the fingers of his left hand
and worked its way across his
frail chest. I asked Numb El-

“It is the will of the trusted

wanderers should pass by my

parched wellspring.’’ The spider
had by now enmeshed half of
Numb Elroy’s body.

flew a predatory nocturnal

As Elroy’s lower jaw became
entangled in web. the Cocka-

When the senator and I turn-
ed to leave, I heard a new sound
among Numb Elroy's_ custo-
mary declamations, a muffled
groan that rose from deep with-
in his body rather than from his
head. But when it had passed
the mumbling continued.

I have seen Numb Elroy often
since then, and the rhetoric has
changed very little. If your
hours do not permit your seeing
him in person, perk your ears
next time you pass that foun-
tain, and perhaps you'll hear.
