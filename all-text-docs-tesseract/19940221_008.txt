THE DAVIDSONIAN O PINI ONS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1994

I heard nothing. I only knew that
' the outside of my high school, just
50 feet away, had become a war
zone.

Months later, I overheard the
words, “gun in the parking lot,”
and I ran outside to find myself
staring down the barrel of a gun.
For some strange reason, fear did
not become a factor. I just stared
into the eyes of a young man who
‘seemed to have no spirit and told
him to leave; he was breaking a
state law.

Weeks later, asmall freshman
girl was mugged on campus dur-
ing lunch by a 22-year-old repeat
offender. And within the follow-
ing month, as I was leaving a foot-
ball game, I saw two young men
and the shadow ofa gun. I walked
immediately towards them until
my boyfriend came running after
me and dragged me in the opposite
direction. The next morning the

F., the past couple of weeks, I
have been reading responses to
Joan Miller’s recent encounter at
Dover’s Supermarket, and frankly,
I am tired of the attitudes in these
responses.

The prevailing attitude seems
to be that Joan Miller overreacted

and had no right for. “yelling”? rac...

ism because of poor service.
Granted, poor service to an Afri-
can-American by a white-Ameri-

can does not constitute racism or |

discrimination, but without a doubt,
each race will see the same situa-
tion very differently.

Imagine this: one Monday
afternoon you are walking down
the street and all seems well. The
sun is shining and nothing could be
better. Then, suddenly, a blonde-
haired man with.blue eyes attacks
you because you have a “better
tan” than he does.

Next Monday comes. around
and you are feeling happy once
again, and then the same blonde-
haired, blue-eyed man attacks you
again for the same reason. This
goes on every Monday for the rest
of the year.

Ask yourself this question:
“What would I expect on the first
Monday of the new year?” You
would probably feel anger, frus-
tration, and maybe even a bit of
helplessness, but you would no
doubt expect the same attack when
you see that blonde-haired, blue-
eyed man.

Now imagine that this hap-.

pens to you every day, every week,
every month of your entire life,
and then imagine how you would
feel and what you would expect.
The sad factis that African-Ameri-
cansin this country have to live out
this scenario, whether they are in
the highest or lowest socio-eco-
nomic positions.

the derogatory glances that blacks
have to look for. Whites don’t
have to be concerned about hidden
agendas in the actions of people of

paper told of the gun that went off
as the two young men scuffled.

Now, two years later, the story
of a freshman boy, quiet and shy,
haunts the halls of my high school
is. He murdered his parents as they
slept and then buried them in a
shallow grave in the backyard be-
cause he wasn’ tallowed to goroller
skating.

I went to school in the suburbs
ofa small city. It was the premiere
high school in our state and one of
the top public high schools in the
country.

Still, there was nothing my
high school could have done to
really change these nightmares. In
the midst of all of our prestigious
awards and high rankings, we ,too,
began to feel the turbulence that

was sweeping the nation.

I came to Davidson and was
initially overwhelmed by its set-
ting. How could life be so tranquil,
void of violence and bloodshed? I
went home during my breaks and
told glimmering stories of how
wonderful and ideal life was in the
small town of Davidson. All my
friends oohed and aahed, and I
beamed proudly over the gem I
had found. I realized that few of
my friends at Davidson have seen
what I saw in high school, and that,
unfortunately, the majority of the
world is similar to my pre-
Davidson days,

Very few of my friends here
know what it is like to have vio-
lence around them. While I am
glad that they didn’t have to expe-

rience the fears, a crucial part of
reality is missing for them, a real-
ity [learned a lot from. The reality
is that some teenagers—an ever
increasing number—get pregnant,
join gangs, kill their families, be-
come addicts, or other horrible
truths.

My outlook now has changed.
Davidson is wonderful; it is ideal
in many ways. But the vast major-
ity of the world outside of Davidson
is far from similar to our little
town.
The only way for us to leave
here and move on to our respective
futures promoting change is to ap-
preciate our world now and realize
that ideal living is possible; we
have come very close to emulating
it here.

The concept is achievable.
The need is to remember these
days and make the ideal a reality

for the world away from Exit 30.

they are historically rooted in reli-
gious traditions. They are spiritual
values. And as Mark Schwehn
observes in his book Exiles for
Eden: Religion & the Academic
Vocation in America (Oxford,
1993), “the practice of [such] spiri-
tual values is and has always been
essential to the process of learning,
even within the secular academy.”

So, while the Christian tradi-
tion shouldn’t set the parameter of
what we can study or believe at
Davidson, it can provide a context
for learning which is neither nar-
row nor exclusive. In fact, it pro-
vides a firm basis for the very
ethical categories of justice and
compassion which are the under-
pinnings of our respect for each
other, even when there are differ-

ences between us.

Ifwemake Christianity merely
ornamental (i.e., “we were founded
by Presbyterians, but that fact has
no bearing on what we’re about
today”), we run the risk of impov-
erishing ourselves. Schwehn again:
“,..0ur present-day academies
[may] be living off a kind of bor-
rowed fund of moral capital. Al-
though they may be able to draw
upon these originally spiritual re-
sources for the time being...[they]
may not be able either to replenish
the fund or to transmit it intact to
the next generation.”

If Davidson is to appreciate its
Presbyterian inheritance, it has to
do so not merely in a reactionary
fashion that fears ch-ch-changes.

Instead, we have to spend this
inheritance in forward-looking

ofourcontemporary, multicultural,
postmodern situation, it provides
excellent currency for building a
new phase of our institutional life.

If we want to be a college that
treasures the intellectual pursuit of

truth, that promotes the virtues

which lend integrity to learning,
that values diversity in the acad-
emy, and that encourages its gradu-
ates to be individuals of fine char-
acter who can serve their commu-
nities in meaningful ways, the wis-
est course before us is to root our-
selves in a tradition which values
the life of the mind and the life of
the spirit, and which, at its best,
provides a strong but flexible basis
for our identity as an institution of
higher learning.

I'm excited about shuffleboard and équestrianism.

Of course, I have to spend
some time discussing the ladies in
the spotlight, Nancy Kerrigan and
Tonya Harding. . I’m going to go
onrecord and say that I hope Tonya
takes the gold medal. Let’s face it:
evil is sexy. Who wants to date

have beer and pizza? Tonya is my
beautiful, muscular lager and pie.

As for Nancy, being a victim is just
too unattractive. Did you see that
cover of Newsweek? Ug-leee.

I place figure skating in the
same class as ballet. Both of these
events require extraordinary physi-
cal prowess, combined with a natu-
ral, flowing gracé refined by years
of hard work. It takes both skill
and determination to rise to the top
of the field after incredible expen-
ditures of time, money and sweat.

And despite all of the death-defy-
ing stunts and superhuman acts of
strength and balance, both ballet
and figure skating are incredibly
boring to watch.

Don’t despair. In two years
we’ll have the Summer Olympics
in Atlanta. Then we can look for-
ward to even more exciting sports
like the marathon, shuffleboard,
and equestrianism. Boy, it almost
makes me excited about the future.

_ one felt, but never seen. You will

Up until this point, my opin-
ion articles have focused primarily —
upon ways of living our lives in the
most harmonious and loving way
possible. If anyone has tried to
practice any techniques of nonvio-
lence, or crossing barriers, then
you have come to the same conclu-
sion that I have. It can’t be done. _
Sometimes, people will piss me
off so much that I simply can’t
treat them in a loving manner.

So how can we live up to these
standards of human conduct which
we all feel are true in our hearts?
How can we truly love our en-
emies? How can we continuously
treat each human being with dig-
nity and respect, no matter how
different they are? How can we
overcome our own pride and hy-
pocrisy? How can our wounded
souls become mended and whole
once again?

The answer to all of these ques-
tions is so simple that we often
dismiss it and construct our own
complicated explanations. The
answer is so powerful that we can-
not look at it directly and we often
run away.

To be honest, I don’t have the
answer. Rather, the answer some-
how mysteriously and
undeservedly has me.

This ultimate answer is God.
God the Creator. God who is both
Mother and Father of us all. God
the Son who has been revealed to
humanity and who reunites us with
him. God the Spirit who flows
among us. God who loves us no
matter who we are.

Wait a second! Stop the
presses! Sound the Jesus freak
alarm! How can anyone make
such a truth claim in this
postmodern, pluralistic world?
Rather than addressing the myriad
of criticisms of Christianity (many
well deserved) or countering vari-
ous scientific explanations of faith
(yes, God is oftentimes merely a
psychological projection of our
own humanity), I would like to end
with a single image which my fac-
ulty advisor once told me.

Picture in your mind a pottery
maker spinning her or his wheel,
while gently shaping the moist clay
with the slight touch of a finger or
thumb.

If the clay is even a little off
center, then asthe wheel spinsfaster
and faster, the clay begins to fly off
of the wheel, eventually becoming
a bunch of orange muck on the
wall. But if the clay is properly
centered, beautiful works of art are
a mere fingertip away.

I feel the same is true of our
spiritual lives. Only through being
properly centered with our Creator
can we become the beautiful uten-
sils needed to receive and spread
God’s love.
