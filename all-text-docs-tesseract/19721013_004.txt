Voting Delay

Students found themselves somewhat confused this
week when the college notary refused to notarize elec-
tion application forms. It was just two weeks ago that
College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. vigorously
encouraged students to participate in the fall elec-
tions.

The process of notarizing the forms is a simple one
requiring little time or effort; yet, college officials in
the Business Office refused to perform this small ser-
vice which they maintained was ‘‘an annoyance.” Not
only that, but several individual students were rudely
treated when they simply inquired about notarization.

This is not the first time we have received com-
plaints about the treatment of students in certain of-
fices of the administration. Although some students
may not act in a manner which deserves polite at-
tention, by in large students are usually friendly
animals that will not become riled unless provoked.

The incident this week about notarization may ap-
pear to some to be small potatoes, but it is symp-
tomatic of a larger prevailing attitude among some
administrators and secretaries that students are their
enemies.

We find this disappointing. The administration
exists to help the students get an education not per-
petuate its own existence. An inquiry from a student
should not be considered an intrusion, but rather an
opportunity to help.

When you think about it, it really isn’t very hard to
smile at another person. In fact most people will
respond in a similar fashion.

Little's Generosity

The dream of every college is a special benefactor
who, though not an alumnus or parent of a student.
will volunteer his help in the building of academic ex-
cellence. John Harvard, James B. Duke and John D.
Rockfeller, Jr. come to mind.

Davidson has such a special friend in E. H. Little, a
man for whom an existing dorm is named and whose
name the new library will bear.

Little, a self-made millionare, has given time and
money to help Davidson become one of the finest
colleges in the South. He has given of himself coun-
tless times to the betterment of the College, not only
in monetary ways but also through service on the
Board of Visitors.

We believe that E. H. Little deserves the ap-
preciation of the academic community and the ad-
miration which should be accorded a true leader in
the efforts for educational superiority at the college.
We welcome him to come and visit again.

Fall Scenes

Just as sleep again fills the mind, the horrible mur-
mur of the electric sundial warns of the approach of
eight o'clock and the long day which must soon begin.
Out from under the cover darts a fast arm, silencing
the noisy menace for the time being.

A few more precious minutes and. all too soon, the
Chamber Maids resound with the clanging of the ten
‘till eight warning. Slowly, resentfully, the covers are
thrown back and an ill-clad body climbs from its
resting place, none too anxious for the sharp shock of
the cold floor and the air outside.

Without thinking, this week's worn jeans and jersey
are slipped around the shivering body, accompanied
this morning by a sweater and jacket. A mad
scramble for books and pencil is capped by a quick
run from the dorm to Chambers, during which the
trees seem to be freeing themselves of their only
protection in haphazard disarray.

Fall has come, and all somehow seems different--
fresher, newer, more exciting. Maybe it's only the

weather. Perhaps it’s hope of better things to come.

A Review

By BOB WRIGHT
Staff Writer

It was Saturday and the city
was as hot as hell. Dave and
Veronica called about noon and
made a date for dinner and
maybe a movie afterwards.
From the table I heard Sharon's
“OK. fine. About six over here?
Sure. See you later.”

Now what the hell did vou tell
them that for?’ I said as she
stepped back into the kitchen
“You know I can't stand Dave
at the movies. He considers
himself the greatest non-
publishing critic in the Western
World. He drives me crazy."

“Well, see if you can put up
with him just for tonite.’ she
said. “It's their anniversary
and we ought tobe nice tothem .”’

All right, but let's see if we
can forego the movies and just
serve drinks or something after
dinner.”

“We'll see.” she said. “but
don't push it. It is their an-
niversary.

I worked all day on some
reports for work through what
must have been the hottest day
of the year. The air conditioning
in the building broke down
about 4 p.m.

I walked down to the park to
cool off and to get out of the
apartment while Sharon made
preparations for the dinner that
night.

Outside the heat was a little
less than unbearable. The
streets overflowed with af-
ternoon traffic and the smell
was intense.

Asphalt has a reflective
quality that will throw heat up
in your face as vou walk over it.
so it seemed hotter on the
streets than inside.

Garbage lay rotting on the
curbs all along the route to the
park. Even in the park itself it
was impossible to escape the
smell or the heat either

At least grass doesn't hit vou
with heat from below. Water
does though as I found out by
the lake. Water's just as bad as
concrete.

When I got home Dave and
Veronica were already there.
We had a few anniversary

drinks, then sweltered through
dinner because the air con-
ditioning wasn't fixed yet.

As we drank our coffee (iced)
afterwards I realized there was
no way to stay in the place that
night. I, for one, had to get out
of there and into some air con-
ditioning. .

We discussed movie
possibilities a few minutes and
then hurried across town to see
‘Deliverance.’ Inside the
theatre it was as cool as could
be expected with the place as
crowded as it was

I generally like adventure
movies and “Deliverance” had
plenty of fast action. Lots of
white water canueing and fine

photography

I also like Jon Voigt’s style of
acting. he never plays a
stereotyped character but

manages to show every im-
portant side of the man he ts
playing. I liked him the best

Afterwards as we were
fighting 1] p.m. trattic I said as
much. Veronica and Sharon
agreed that Burt Reynolds was
the best looking of the tour main
characters and theretore their
favorite in the movie

Dave. tor once. was silent
Conversation turned to other
matters until we reached home
Dave still hadn't spoken

Sharon insisted on serving
drinks at our place so she and
Veronica retired to the kitchen
while Dave and | sat oan the

couch. ‘‘Well, thank God they
got the air conditioning fixed,"’ |
said.

“Yeah.” he replied, ‘but
someday they won't. Someday
‘they’ won't get anything fixed.
And then...survival. Just like
Burt Reynolds said."

“Yeah but look what happens
to him. That river kicked the
shit out of him. And it killed that
Drew" guy. Hell, even Jon
Voigt almost got killed."

“Uh, huh. That's right.’ he
said.

We sat in silence for a minute
until the women came in with
drinks

An hour later we stood on the
curb and said our goodbyes
“Dave.” I said as the girls
talked of babies and shopping.
“do vou really believe that

stuff. .about it all coming down
to survival in the end?”

“No.” he said, “not. sur-
vival... deliverance They re
two different things.”

We didnt see Dave or

Veronica for a while and the
next time we called them there
was somebody else living in
their apartment.

“T think they left the city tor
good.’ the landlord told us
“Veronica was pregnant and
Dave just couldn't stand the
streets anymore.”

Today the air conditioning
broke down again. Dave would
be pleased.
