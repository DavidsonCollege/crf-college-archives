LANGUAGE MEET

Representatives Attend Meeting
Of South Atlantic Modern
Language Association

PROGRAM IS INTERESTING

Vowles And Watts Read Papers
Before Convention

The College of Charleston was host to
the seventh annual meeting of the South
Atlantic Modern Language Association
which convened in the historic and beau-
tiful South Carolina city on last Friday
and Saturday, November 30 and Decem-
ber 1.

Almost all the professors in the Mod-
ern Language Department here attended
and took active parts in the activities of
the convention. Professor Erwin, a past
president of the organization served as
chairman of the auditing committee.
Professors Blythe and Fleagle, of the
Spanish department, were present and
Professor Fleagle led the round table
discussion held for the Spanish division.
Dr. Vowles, of the German department,
read a’paper on the irregularities in the
German language and also served on the
committee for the nomination of general
officers. Professor Minault and Dr.
Watts represented the French depart-
ment here and Dr. Watts read a paper
on Louis Racine’s De La Grace. He also
served as chairman on the committee of
general nominations.

It is reported that the attendance was
good, but that it was not up to expec-
tations because of the inconvenience of
the place of meeting. The representatives,
including those from Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, North and South Carolina,
Tennessee, and Virginia, will meet next
year at the University of Georgia in
Athens.

There were three general sessions of
the convention, one time set apart for
group meetings, and one meeting devoted
to research work, during the two days
of the convention.

During the meeting on Friday after-
noon, the progress of the Speech Atlas
was outlined. This is a compilation of
linguistic material into book form and
sponsored by this organization in the
South Atlantic states. Of other interest
was the presentation of Gullah Readings
by Mr. René Ravenel and a play, The
Romance of the Willow Pattern, pre-
sented by the College of Charleston Dra-
matic Society.

The meeting was drawn to a close on
Saturday noon after the officers for the
ensuing year were elected. The new
officers were as follows: President, Pro-
fessor J. C. Dawson, U. of Alabama;
Secretary and Treasurer, John A. Straus-
baugh, Emory University; Executive
Committee, Professor Clement Vollmer,
Duke and Professor Elizabeth Johnson,
Winthrop.

During the unoccupied intervals of the
meeting, the visitors enjoyed the histori-
cal points of interest and the scenic
beauty of Charleston during this time of
the year.

Photographer Will
BeHere This Week

This Is Last Chance To Have Pic-
tures Taken Before Christmas
Holidays Begin

The Annual Photographer will be at
school three days of this coming week to
take more pictures for the annual. He
has made several trips to, Davidson for

* the purpose of getting the annual photo-
graphs in a little early but his purpose
seems to have been defeated. The plea
for getting the pictures for the annual is
very important and it is hoped that all
the boys who have not had their picture
taken will do so on his appearance this
trip. He will be here ‘Wednesday, Thurs-
day and Friday of this week and will be

‘in the parlor of Watts till 9 P.M. each
night. It is asked by the annual staff
that the students-please have their pic
tures taken on this trip. Boys wh
would like to have their picture before
Christmas will have to have them taken
now.

The pictures that wete taken on the
last visit of the photographer are here
now and those students who have seen
them seem to be very well satisfied. The
fraternity pictures are here also and they
‘too seem to be exceptionally good.

NINE DEBATERS
OELEGTED FROM
THYOUT ENTRIES

Boggs, Port, Selango, Smith,
Stutts, And Sugg Named Reg-
ulars On Team

TWENTY - SIX COMPETED

Dubose, Edwards, And Harlan
Chosen As Alternates

Davidson College will stand a good
chance to carry off high honors in the
field of intercollegiate debating this win-
ter if the tryouts for varsity debating
are a good way to judge her potential
strength.

This year there were more men inter-
ested in debatittg than formerly. Varsity,
debating seems to be regaining interest
in the eyes of Davidson students; not
only were there many trying out, but
from time to time during the debates
members of the student body came in and
listened for a while.

Out of the Qwenty-six men who were
competing for places on the team, six
were elected and three alternates named.

The six who will compose the team
are: Wade Boggs, A. T. Port, James
Salango, Jr., R. H. Smith, A. C. Stutts,
and Harold G. Sugg.

The alternates are Warner DuBose,
Wilbur Edwards, and P. Y. Harlan

The judges were Dr. W. P. Cumming,
Dr. C. K, Brown, Albert McClure, and
Gordon H. Brown who acted in an ad-
Visory capacity to the judges and also
as presiding officer.

The debates were judged on two prin
cipal points, the convincing power of the
speaker and the argument presented.

The tryouts which were to be held in
the Eumenean Hall were transferred at
the last minute to a class room in Cham-
bers since there was not adequate heat
in the Eumenean building.

The twenty-six contestants drew for
their order of speaking. Each speaker
was given five minutes for his arguient.

As yet there has been no decision as
to who will make the trips which have
been planned for the team. Bob Smith,
president of the forensic council, said
that the trips will be made in pairs, two
going on each of the three trips which
have been planned.

It is our privilege this year to assist
this man in carrying on this great work.
