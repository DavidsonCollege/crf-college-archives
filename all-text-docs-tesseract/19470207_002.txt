As I was thinking over past editorials
suddenly I became aware that most had
given the entirety of their length toward
seeking improvements, and thus decided
that this time it would be fitting to praise
the results of our efforts.

Student Store

Due to requests voiced by the David-
sonian, it was moved back to its original
position behind Georgia and extended.
Cleanliness was stressed and a truthful
endeavor gave the students what they
wanted, The question of higher prices a-
rose and by publishing letters to the Edi-
tor, the managemnet sought to reveal
their economic stress together with their
basis of operation.

The Wildcat Spirit

... has-shown a remarkable climb since
the first of the year and for this we wish
to congratulate the cheer leaders and en-
courage the student body on until the
time when it might again be said “You
may. beat Davidson, but. you won’t out-
cheer them,”

Walks WereyNeeded
and the College answers our request
by making the school grounds a better
place to walk on.

Friendliness was Emphasised
. and the students responded feeling
the need of that warm old Davidson tradi-
tion of speaking on the campus. And then

I thought of our motto— “Allenda lux
ubi orta libertas”—lit. ‘Where there is

light... ...

THE LIGHTS HAD GONE OUT!
Now I am not a very stable person and
this changed my entire viewpoint. Why
must the lights go out? Anyone who stays
in the vicinity of Davidson long realizes
that there is little variation in the ‘in-

clemency—just rain ,But that night—the
moon was out, quite bright, but not suf-
ficient to read by, which madé it very
hard for those with last minute studies.
This has occured all too frequently in the
past and I see no reason why a remedy
could not be sought.

First of all, not only does it place a
handicap upon all in the dormitory but
presents a serious menace on the stairs
which in several dormitories are not even
lighted by windows. I do not wish to place
undue emphasis upon this menace, however
since most of the damage done is that to the
ear-drun resulting from boisterous sounds
ending in ‘Turn on the. . . lights.’’ Al-
though this is quite successful in breaking
the monotony of a sultry night, I’m sure
that none of us feel any the better for it.

My purpose is not to over-rate this an-
noyance to the point that it becomes amus-
ing, but to merely paint out that this is
one of the little things that might be
little effort
authorities, thereby making our life on

bettered with by proper
the campus more enjoyable. And_ that,

should be a main*consideration !

Speaking of considerations, I feel it
only fair to illustrate a gross injustice done
to numerous students during registration.
Although Mr. A, had an exam on Friday
afternoon, he heeded the rules of the ad-
ministration and went to register Friday
morning. After two hours of assuming
numerous positions of standing and sitting

in the hall—which was not designed to fol-

low the curve of the spine—he was shock-
ed to find the door closing while he was

far behind. Thus rather sore for this ex-
perience, he went to his exam. Saturday

but after several hours he again saw the
door close. Monday morning he ‘got in —
and paid a fee for being late. This happen-
ed not to one but a great number of
students.

Now I’m not finding fault with the
Registrar’s office nor the Few.loyal ones
who help, but I do see room for improve-
in the system. Not only does this long
wait and fee become a major annoyance
but when the former occurs during exams,
it becomes serious.

I have been told before that an objection
against the system carries more weight
if an improvement is suggested. The Col-
lege could employ’ more people to help
the Registrar, who was too heavily loaded
during the last registration, and thus make
it easier as well as being sure that the
courses are planned according to expected
date of graduation. Many students were
forced to go back several times of conflicts
and too few hours,

Another great help would be—a-means
of making an oppointment and thereby
eliminate unnecessary waiting. To be
frank, the present situation was a pain
in the neck and it is the hope of the
student body that such will never again
exist.

BY BOB RIERSON

Just to keep up appearances, this
column would like to get seriots
for one issue and echo an item
that was included on last week’s
Davidsonian editorial page. This
editorial a discussion of the
relative merits of the quarter. and
semester systems of the college
year and came to the appropriate
conclusion that the old semester
to. which Davidson. still
is outmoded and in
the forward-looking
followed this
school. This corner would now like
to add a hearty, though possibly
ineffective, second to the opinions
expressed,

To be sure, there are good points
on both sides of the question, as
there are in any debate, but the
quarter system, already adopted by
most of the outstanding education-
al institutions in this country, seems
to have a substantial majority on
its side. I believe everyone will a-
gree that the bright prospects of
Christmas and spring holidays are
considerably dimmed by the know-
ledge that, on return, the poor Da-
vidson student has the horror of the
‘ages, examinations, awaiting him.
The fall quarter ends right before
Christmas, and all themes, term
papers, parallel reports, ete., are in
and forgotten, and the student can

(Shades of a long weekend!) This
might raise some objection because
certain classes might be too hard
to have to prepare for every day
Then too the factor of boredoin
might enter in. These objections,
however, may be countered by
stating that there are just as many

courses where five days > a week
would be most beneficial because
much more can be leared by hay-
ing a course every day, as many
of us who have attended such
classes in other colleges can testify.
Then too the assignments need not
be quite so long when a class meets
every day.

Another point in favor of the
quarter system is that three” quar=
ters comprise the school year, thus
allowing for examinations to come
more frequently and eliminating to
a great degree the
amount of work that

“Mighty McQuirk”

The only information that could
be found on the whole of the David-
son campus concerning the alove
motion pictures was the fact that
Wallace Berry is starred in “The
Mighty McQuirk,” and “Gallant
Bess” is a very colorful story of
a horse. So just put your 32 cents
“on the nose” and be thankful for
a “show.”

The Operating Table

Leading the list for this week’s
table are those members of our
noble clan who line themselves be-
fore the wailing wall as the usual
number of flush notices come pour-
ing in for the Mid-Winters set.
Without a doubt top honors go to
“FOOTS” CURRIE, who not only
got the word but received the en-
gagement announcement at the
same time. It is rumoured that Cur-
rie has been seeking advice from
“THE GREEK” on how to handle

such a situation. Not to be left
completely out of the picture is

the notorious “FIREPLUG” FAIR-
LY. Not onee but twice have the
fateful telegrams been delivered
to our comrad in the cause. Un-
daunted, however Fairly has reach-
ed into the depths of the little
black book and has brought forth
a_third.-

Interesting operation of the week
was pulled by “SOCIAL SAM”
TATE and Phi Delt compaions.
After many harrowing adventures
in the Queen City in quest of suit-
able companions, the quartet end-
ed the journey with a group of
noises from the Memorial Hospi-
tal Area. Details are being more
closely guarded than the Phi Delt
ritual.
