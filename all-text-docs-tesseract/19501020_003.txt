Davidsonian Commemorates First Homecoming, 1923

Stunts Featured —
Homecoming, 1923

Stune night has made ite bow
to the students of Davidson,
and the success of the occa-
sion warrants its perpetuation
as an annual student body
function. Stunt night ie well
qualified to fill the place of
the deceased Senior speaking.
It should be preserved as the
biggest event of the Fall
calendar, and made a nucleus
around which a week-end of
social activity can be builded.

At Davidson a man is trained
for mental and physical
prowess. The courses of in.
struction, the publications, the
literary organizations, occa-
sional lectures, sermons, the
library, and campus expression
all tend to make of the David-

* gonian an intellectual peer. The
athletic teams, gymnasiums and
R.O.T.C. atrive toward de-

* velopment of physical prowess.

* But what is done for the de-
velopment of the Davidsonian’s
eocial being?

The Junior Speaking event
in the Spring is the only social
occasion spared, since the aboli-
tion of Senior Speaking. Es-
sential in man’s preparation for
life are those elements of
social conduct the development
of which the average man at
Davidson is deprived. These
things seem to be forgotten in
Davidson’s rush for scholastic
and athletic attainment. The
need is for a big social event
during the early months of
the college year, and Stunt
Night has offered a solution to
the problem. Stunt Night in
the Fall! Junior Speaking in the
Spring!

A Davidson graduate should
be an all ‘round man, to take
his place in the ranks of the
world, socially as well as in-
tellectually.

Such was Editor-in-Chief Lis-
ton D. Elkins’ editorial comment
as The Davidsonian celebrated the
the birth of its child, Homecoming
week-end. Then, as now, ‘The Da-
vidsonian was “the livest wire on
the hill,” according to its masthead
and the advent of the new Fall so-
cial week-end was its latest triumph
over complete intellectualism on the
campus.

Replacing the defunct Senior
Speaking, the new “Stunt Night”
was coupled with the Citadel game
on Saturday, October 13, 1923.
These two. events plus the dedi-
cation of Richardson Field formed
a program which amply satisfied
every student's social cravings. The
first Homecoming Dance probably
came several years later, when,
after having dedicated all nearby
fields, the college realized that it
would soon run out of that com-
modity and would have to throw
in a replacement to keep the par
value of the tuition up.

Stunt Night in the Fall! Junior
Speaking in the Spring! A verita-
ble merry-go-’round of social en-
gagements, well calculated to keep
the Davidson scholar out of the
heretical depths of philosophical
concentration. What a Sunt Night
it was, too!

The -first event on their thvill
packed program was the rendition,
by the Jazz Orchestra, of three
hit-parade tunes of 1923, “The
House of David Blues,” “Some-
body’s Wrong,” and that tear
jerker, “Sobbing Blues.” Following
these numbers “Bevo Davis, im-

Our movies include three classes
of people—we, the students, the
faculty and friends, and kids. Some
years ago a gentleman would never
smoke in any public building where
there were mixed crowds, nor
around ladiés. Although smoking
is quite the fad among the women
of some sections, it has not reached
here yet.

The town people object, the

faculty does not like it, and our,

friends, many of them, say nothing,
but they must consider it bad taste.
It is bad for all three classes, be-
cause it makes the hall very close
on hot nights, it mars the clearness
of the pictures and it is a nuisance
to the students. We have to place
our cigarettes somewhere, and
those above throw them down on
those below. Those below natural.
ly re-act and it causes disturbances.

It shows little courtesy for the
faculty or our friends, It is cer-
tainly to the discredit of our man-
ners. No one could go into a de-
cent theatre smoking away on
cigarette stubs. It sets the kids bad
examples and in attempting to fol-

New Road Connects|Orthodoxy of Profs
Davidson, Charlotte |Praised by Speaker

The Davidson College Highway,
formally dedicated to the service
of the State on Monday of this
week by Governor Cameron Mor.
tison, is an already important
artery of trade, connecting two
of North Carolina’s most important
business towns and embracing a
number of smaller towns in which
there is a great volume of busi-
ness. The total cost of this as.
phalt highway was $1,218,000, or
about $32,000 per mile.

The total length is 38.4 miles,
the new highway effecting a sav-
ing of 4.7 miles distance between
Charlotte and Statesville. The
new way has eliminated nine dan.
gerous crossings, thus helping to
prevent many accidents. The road
itself is a masterpiece of the road
builders’ art and is said to be the
best road in the state. It has a
concrete base five inches thick and
two inches of the best quality as-
phalt for a top layer; this latter
offering a firm, yet resilient trac-
tive surface for all kinds of vehicles.
The width, 18 feet, allows plenty
of room for two vehicles to pass

each other, eyen at a high speed.

Kinnon filled the hail with that
old spiritual, “Nobody Knows How
Green I Am.” Available historical
documents do not reveal just how
“J. O. Craig and the Earnest
Brothers entertained the audience
with a trio played on ordinary
carpenters’ saws.” There is some
evidence that leads one to believe
that they beat the so-called “Kiser
Twins” to produce the sound to
the tune of “My Father's Comical
Mule.”

During a visit to our office the

that the enforcement of prohibition
had quite taken his breath away.

these days of arrogant and impious
denials of the divinity of Christ
and of the immortality of the soul.

He referred several times to an
advertisement which had previous-
ly appeared in an Atlanta paper
over the signature of Davidson
College, under the caption, “The
Faith of Our Faculty.” The ad-
vertisement concerned a question.
naire circulated among several
thousand teachers of science in
American colleges. Two hundred and
eighty-nine answers were received,
of which number 53.7 per cent de-
clared their belief in God, while
44.7 per cent said they disbelieved
in the theory of the immortality
of the soul.

“I was happy to note that no
such deplorable situation prevails
among the faculty members of Da-
vidson College, according to this
advertisement; and regret that more
of our American Colleges are un-
able to boast of the same type of
instructors,” said Mr. Holcombe.

“If the agnostics, the liberalists,
and the modernists have captured
as many colleges as the showing
indicates, give them seven years to
work in and they will capture the
entire student body of our edu-
cational institutions. These students
will go out into the world and
begin preaching and teaching the
same arrogant and impious denials

This action on the part of the
Generals, although it may mean
a momentary defeat in the-transient
season of 1923, is a laurel on the
brows of the team from the Old
Dominion. It is a victory in the
fight the Southern colleges and
universities are waging against race
equality in intercollegiate athletics.

Stand behind the Generals, col-
lege men of the South! They are
taking a step which should be fol-
lowed by every college in America.
The Northern school has gone be-
neath the yoke, but it is still the
privilege of the Southern teams to

came accustomed to the gruelling
spectacle; then becoming braver
they even tried their skill at this
most engrossing game. Dazed by
the power of which they suddenly
became possessed; they have -used
this power to the detriment of even
the members of the upper classes.

With the completion of Watts
Dormitory and the advent of Dr.
C. K. Brown's long and distin-
guished tenure of office on the
faculty, 1923 promised to be a big
year in Davidson annals.

And so it was. Governor Cam
Morrison ran a highway from
Statesville to Charlotte, 38.4 miles
of road builder’s masterpiece, which
incidentally, ‘passed by Davidson's
already hallowed portals; the stu-
dent store was placed on the honor
system; and the poor college presi-
dent, then as now, added a few
gray hairs completing a campaign
for funds to restore recently burned
Chambers.

From our viewpoint, however,
1923 looms large on the horizon as
the year of the first Davidson
Homecoming. Twenty-seven glori-
ous Octobers have passed since
then, and, with the exception of two
war years, old D. C. has annually
called back its alumni to watch

Observer Sport Page Called Partial To Carolina;
Fails To Reveal News Of Important Wildcat Game

“Reliable is news service,” is one
of the salient points advertised on
the initial pages of the Charlotte
Observer. Students of Davidson
College, and supporters of the Pres-
byterian cleven throughout the
South, and we venture to say, free
thinkers in general, are beginning
to wonder if this same policy of
“reliability” has been drilled into
Bailey Groome, of “One Man’s
Opinion,” fame, and conductor of
the Observer sport department.

Reliability to the nth degree is
Groome, in one sense of the word,
at least. We know that he will
string the Chapel Hill Tar Heels
from one column to eight, and we

can “rely” on his doing it every
week; we can rely, also, on his
suppression of everything that

possible to believe that they will
ever depart from that policy of
excluding the blood of Africa from
their ranks.

Washington and Jefferson is to
be commended for their spirit in
declining to accept the Virginia
school’s forfeiture. They prefer to
have the game entered on the
pages of football history as a can-
celled contest.

Of the Davidson-V.P.I. game
last Saturday, a contest which has
as much significance in the race
for state championship honors as
any game participated in by North

nothing, and probably for the reason
that it might reflect credit on the

appropriate only as a grammar

Mr. Groome, are you just out
and out antagonistic to Davidson?.
Or, do you mean well, but just

can't arouse the necessary punch
and pep which is required to edit
a creditable sport.sheet? Or is it
your love for Carolina that domi.

terians.

by the Observer sport scribes to.

of a prominent member of your.
Chamber of Commerce) is allowed
to enter into your work of serving
