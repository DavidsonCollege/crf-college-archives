GREY HOUSE—

“continued-use” &
or “non-conforming use’?

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

“With the proposed zoning
plan, the town certainly does
not have in mind an active
direction of the expansion of
the College,’ said Davidson
Mayor Tom Sadler.

“All must realize, however,
that the development of the
‘town and the College go hand-

‘in-hand.

“The proposed zoning plan
will ensure that this develop-
ment is orderly and planned,”
he continued.

“The planning commission
has worked for years on their
zoning proposal, dealing with
all segments of the community
—the black population, com-
mercial interests, industries,
and other townspeople, as well
as the College and its stu-
dents.

Zoning code for Davidson community

Town's future awaits

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

The planning commission of
the Town Council is nearing
completion on a new zoning
code for the community of
Davidson.

The proposed code divides
the town into areas for resi-
dential, commercial, and indu-
strial activity, setting guide-
lines for future development in
Davidson.

major landowner

Davidson College 1s one ot
the major landowners in the
town, and certain segments of
the proposed code are of
special interest to the College
community.

Under the zoning ordinance,
which must meet the approval
of the Town Council, the
campus proper would be zonea
into two areas: the first,
College A, where administra-
tion buildings, classrooms and
faculty dorms would be per-
mitted; the second, College B,
in which student housing and
operational! facilities (laundry,
steam plant, etc.) could be
located. College A contains
the campus land from Concord
Street on the south to Dorm
Row on the north; College B is
the land from Dorm Row to
the north border of the cam-
pus.

dormitory construction

Any further dormitory con-
struction, according to the
ordinance, must be 200 feet
inside the College B boundary
lines. The 200 foot buffer zone
ensures the homeowners on
North Main Street that .a
student housing facility will
not be built ‘‘in their back

The. status of the College's
perimeter townhouses is also
considered in the proposed

zoning ordinance.

Dr. Annamarie Burts,
member of the planning com-
mission, said “there is some
feeling among the townspeople
that the College has been
irresponsible in increasing efi-
roliment without expanding
dorm housing on-campus.

‘‘And with the passing of
the College’s role in loco

parentis, some believe that the
school has not*made it clear to
students in perimeter houses
that they are residents and
members of the community
with responsibilities beyond
those of the on-campus stu-
dents.”

three Categories

The zoning ordinance classi-
fies the ‘‘multi-person’’ hous-
ing into three-categories: 1)
Shared dwellings—four or
fewer unrelated individuals
living in one facility. Shared
dwellings will be permitted
everywhere in the areas zoned
‘residential’. 2) Rooming
house —five to eight unrelated
individuals living in one facil-
ity. Rooming houses will be
allowed along Concord and
Main Streets on lots within
200 feet of the campus proper.
3) Residence hall—nine or
more unrelated individuals liv-
ing in one facility. These are
permitted along Main Street
on lots within 200 feet of the
campus.

“Under the ordinance, any
person can house up to four
individuals without special
permission required,’’ said
Burts.

additional townhouses

“If, the College, or any
developer, wanted to convert
another townhouse to hold five
or more students, a lot within
200 feet of campus would have

to be found. The developer’s
plan for the house must in-
clude ample parking for occu-
pants, provisions for mainten-
ance, upkeep, and other re-
quirements,’’ she continued.
A-crucial question is the

-impact of the proposed ordin-

ance on the College’s existing
perimeter townhouses.
continued-use label

If the houses are designated

“Determined efforts - have
been made to be fair to all
sides, and the proposed?zoning
regulations are not aimed at
one group or another.

“We don’t believe that the
proposed regulations will solve
all problems in one fell swoop.
But nowhere are there better
people than the people in Dav-
idson, and if we work in good
faith with each other, the
proposed zoning plan will be a
better, stronger ordinance
than we now have, and the

new guidelines will be a solid.

foundation for future growth.

“Over the years, relations
between the town and the
College have been real good.

‘‘When the town is inona
decision with the College, we
always get a reasonable hear-
ing. The final decision isn’t
always the one we wanted, but
it is a fair decision.

zoning

“continued-use facilities’’,
they will be able to operate as
usual regardless of the new
ordinance.

five-year evaluation

However, if the town com-
mission decides to label the
houses “non-conforming
uses’’, the facilities will be
evaluated by the Town Coun-
cil five years_after_the ‘ordin-
ance takes effect.

“Town and College must
keep closer communication.
There are people with the town
government who are close
friends with administrators at
Davidson. Brother Meetze
(Director of Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze, Jr.) and I
are the best of friends—I talk
to him almost everyday.. But
just because I speak with him
as a friend does not mean. I
know all the details of his job
or the policies and plans for
the future of Davidson. It’s
just not natural to announce
to your close friends the intri-
cacies of your job.

“There should be an official
line of communication between
townspeople, students living
in town, administrators of the
College, and town officials.
Complaints could then be voi-
ced and problems cut off

before they start.’’

plans

If by this time the non-con-
forming perimeter houses are
still in: violation_of the stand-
ards of the zoning code, the
town would have the right to
close the house. Closing of any
perimeter facility would fur-
ther pinch Davidson's crow-
ded housing for students.

lectures on
Robert Frost

By ROBERT HUTCHINSON
Dr. Carlos Baker, Princeton profes-
sor of literature and noted literary

critic will visit Davidson Tuesday,

Baker, an authority in modern

American and English. literature,
gained wide recognition in the fall of
1952 with his publication of the first
full-length story of Ernest Heming-
way, entitled Hemingway: The Wri-
ter as Artist.

The volume was enthusiastically
received by leading critics. One stated
in the New York Herald Tribune:
‘Full of lucid and informed interpre-
tations, this is that excellent kind of
criticism which, whether we agree
with all of its conclusions, helps
everywhere to clarify our reaction...
Baker has done a major job of literary
reevaluation..."’

After Hemingway's death in 1961,
Baker was invited by publisher
Charles Scribner, Jr., to undertake a
biography of the writer. The final
version, entitled Ernest Hemingway:

A Life Story, was a Book-of-the-
Month Club selection for April 1969.
It has to date been translated into
eleven foreign languages.

He is currently at work on a
biographical study of Ralph Waldo
Emerson, as well as a fourth novel to
be called The Fence.

Baker has also done critical work on
Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats, Cole-
ridge, Fielding, and Frost.

Baker will be in the Conversation
Pit at 10 am on Tuesday for an
informal chat, in the 900 Room at 2
pm for a question and answer session,
ahd in the 900 Room again at 8 pm for
his main lecture entitled ‘‘Robert
Frost: The Harsh Divorce."
