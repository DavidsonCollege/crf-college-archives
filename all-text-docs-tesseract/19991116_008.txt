Dancing outside the box: NCDT shines on stage

By Kristen TAYLOR
Staff Writer

The North Carolina Dance Theatre (NCDT)
remains a tour-de-force. As Amanda Lanier, head
of the Union Board Artists Series Committee, puts
it, “Bringing NCDT to Davidson is a real coup.”

Friday’s show opened with “Duo Concertant,”
choreographed by Artistic Director Jean-Pierre
Bonnefoux to the music of Igor Stravinsky. The
program explained that the piece “celebrates the
art of partnering.” Well-matched Traci Gilchrest
and Hernan Justo kept a spontaneous flow of
movement. At certain intervals they walked to the
area where violinist Eun-Sun Lee and pianist Anna
Brock played and respectfully listened, expanding
the partnership metaphor between the two dancers
and the dancers and the music.

The second piece, “Syrinx,” also choreo-
graphed by Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, spotlighted
Kati Hanlon appropriately accompanied by a lilt-
ing flute. A siren, Hanlon’s green eyes flashed,
and the calculated style with which she worked the
stage proved a sharp-.contrast to the freer first
piece. Ms. Hanlon’s gaze only left the audience to
be directed at Amy Blumenthal, playing Debussy’s
famous work for solo flute. A series of stylized
grande battements ended the piece, toying with an

audience that wanted a longer time with Hanlon.

Another standout piece of the evening was
“Beethoven Sonata.” Amy Earnest sparkled as a
woman torn between her love for dance and the
restrictions her partner placed upon her. Her im-
passioned face carried the piece to a level that also
examined the art of partnership. At times reminis-
cent of the film “The Red Shoes,” Ms. Earnest
primarily seemed a modern Coppelia, boxed in by
her partner like a doll. Mark Diamond’s vibrant
choreography emphasized a motif of the male’s
arm pushing their female partners in front of her
face. Towards the end, Ms. Earnest adopted this
move with another woman. This piece reflects
even more deeply the relationship between two
dancers that are partners, collaborators.

Paul Taylor’s classic “Esplanade” closed the
strong program. The skin-toned costumes allowed
the audience to focus on the real message of the
piece, the constant re-creation and invention of
dance. In the first movement, the upbeat music
matches the dancers’ smiles as they athletically
create “an exhilarating dance vocabulary.” In the
second movement, however, the arms become
rigid and unflexible, the movements strained. The
end of this movement shows the dancers moving
in unison in a circle on all fours: without artistic
freedom the dancers have been reduced to an

animalistic state where movement becomes for-
mulaic and contrived. In the last movement, the
music brightened once again and the dancers moved
so freely that the audience laughed with them as
one dancer literally hopped and skipped over six
prone dancers. Then the female dancers run and
daringly jump into their partner’s arms, defying
gravity and the gasping audience’s expectations.
The entire piece seemed to focus on pushing bound-
aries, and the unparalleled choreography of “Es-
planade” remains fun with this powerful ensemble.
NCDT’s athletic approach more than handled this

well-known and important piece, and with pure

joy on their faces brought out the subtleties of

Paul Taylor.

How marvelous it will be when the new
Student Union is built, and Davidson can afford
artists a stage on which they will not have to
rework blocking. Hodson’s stage seemed
crowded in the last two numbers, the space barely
accommodating the larger ensembles. Not often
a forum for professional ballet, Davidson was
privileged to have hosted this elite ensemble.
