_ “The Y is an important
potential service organization
which can raise the value
consciousness of the campus
and the students’ sensitivity to
social concerns,’ said YMCA
President Jay Silver. °

Few students or faculty
members realize what the
YMCA does, what projects have
been undertaken or what the
goals of the organization are.

The local YMCA is not
directly associated with the
national branch of the YMCA
but is rather a private service-
oriented program of Davidson
College.

“The key word of the Y is
facilitate,’’ said Silver.

“We need people who are
interested in committing
themselves, who would like to
take an interest in the Y and
help the cabinet develop the
means to communicate to
students and to get ideas for
services both on and off cam-

‘In order to coordinate the

various service organizations
on campus, a Community
Relations Board, chaired by
SGA Senator Will Miller, has
been set up.

tatives from the
Y, from APO and from all the
houses on Patterson Court,
meet regularly to inform one
another about what each group
is doing.

The houses on Patterson
Court have been taking more of
an initiative in starting service
projects. The Y serves as &
mediator.

If there is a need in the
community the Y can approach
one of the houses on the Court
and suggest that they undertake
a project.

One of the major problems
of the Y has been its lack of
publicity. Therefore, the Y is
planning forum lunches, and
social activities to stimulate
student interaction, and the Y
will also publicize its events in
The Davidsonian and over
WDAV.

The Y holds informal
luncheons at the Depot every
Thursday. ‘Although turnouts

Take power seriously

The most powerful positions students can hold are on the

advisory committees and the EPC.

Decisions are made and policy is set in the committees
concerning the future of Extended Studies, the Honors Center,
Patterson Court, club sports, intercollegiate athletics, budget,
admissions and financial aid, just to name a few.

These are the areas which directly affect the lives of the

students here. \

No one knows this. Some students on the committees do
not even attend the meetings. Other students either do not
know the committees exist or do not take advantage of their

potential power on them.

Advisory committee members have full vote on any issue.
They also have the opportunity to persuade others on the

committee to vote as they wish.

Equally as important as the vote, however, is the student

imput.

If you are not on a committee, find out who is and tell them

how you feel about an issue.

If you are on acommittee take your job seriously enough to
affect pos.tive decisions and change when necessary. If
enough students use their mouths as such the student voice

will be heard.

for more freshman par-
ticipation,” Silver said.

The Y is planning to have
occasional speakers and invite
former faculty members to
these luncheons.

The orgenization is also
working on the possibility of
using the depot as either a

. resource center for the eleerly,
an and crafts center, or as
a coffeehouse that would offer
music and various activities
and which would offer an outlet
for student talents.

The Y also sponsors S1KP,
a tutoring program for
elementary school children. In
the next year it hopes to
strengthen and expand the
program. There are currently
sixty tutors but it would like to

~Complaints

By BILL PEEPLES

All year long, Davidsonian articles
have been laced with complaints of an
academic program on the decline, the
quality of courses and progessors not
being in keeping with the needs of the
students. The student body has taken
to the media to complain of academic
standards that too stringent, forcing
students into an apathetic social
system in which they are unable to
confront members of the opposite sex
with any marked degree of reality or
social maturity. Still others assail an
administration with deaf ears, totally
unyielding to students’ demands. The
administration claims that ‘‘we are
working on it.”

Well, who is in the right? Who
possesses the secret for solving all our
problems and grievances? ‘l'o some
degree, we are all correct, and we all
have the resources to rid ourselves of
these unwanted circumstances. Then,
why all the fuss? Why blame Sam
Spencer, Will Terry, the SGA, Scotty
Nicholls, the police, the faculty, the
coaches, the girls, the national frater-
nities, the guy across the hall? Try
blaming ourselves for a change. If we
gain nothing else from the Davidson
Experience, the liberation of a liberal
arts education, we must recognize
that we are all human, we all err, and

Grades are

As regarding G. E. Michalson’s
article in the recent Davidsonian, I
overwhelmingly empathize with his
sentiment, however I can’t but help
feeling somewhat tired and bitter
upon hearing it another time, just as I

did back in high school. The whole ~

concept of grades being unimportant
and that learning is the true reward is
a thoroughly acceptable ideal and in
our present society a total crock.

¢ For nearly six years now, numer-
ous and varied teachers have tried to
impress me with this attitude and the
fine institutions where they work
have always responded to this fullest
capacity by showing it to be unapplic-
able. As long as we’re stuck in a
culture that has to evaluate and
numerate everything to a set stan-
dard, personal acheivement as felt by
the individual alone, leads to nothing
positive outside his own inner uni-
verse. Even-were someone-to-feel
completely satisfied with his present
eyolution towards his intellectual

ting-spring term

increase the number to 100.

There has been a problem
recently in the variety and
number of activities that tutors
can participate in with their
tutees.

Currently the Y is looking
into opening up the ceramics
workshop in the Union for those
in the STEP program.

It is also trying to make the
tutors aware of activities
available in the Community
Center, which sponsors
basketball clinics and arts and
crafts programs.

The Christmas fund drive
provided the Y with enough
money to give the Community
Center $500 to buy a movie
projector so that cartoons and
short films can be shown.

don’t help

we must work together if we are ever
to amount to anything in the real
world.

Easier said than done. Granted,
President Spencer is very much at
fault for failing to realize our needs
and wants. But we are at fault for not
making Uncle Sam, or any other
administrator, aware of our problems.
As one Davidsonian staffer recently
noted, the campus attitudes and
causes of the sixties are now history.
But one problem lingers on, and we
will be forever burdened by it if we do
not act immediately. We must bridge .
the omnipresent gap between stu-
dents and administration. Otherwise
we will always have an outdated
Science Building, and inadequate
Infirmary, rising vandalism, freshmen
disappointed at self-selection, a losing
and criticized jo¢kocracy, and a narrow
course selection, a hampered and pam-
pered administration.

Everyone will never be totally
satisfied all the time, or else no one

, would be at Davidson to learn and to

improve. But griping is not the
solution, for actions will always speak
louder than words. We all were
judged as having the motivation and
intellect to be admitted here, so let’s
all put our brains in gear instead of
our mouths. Case rests.....until we do
something!

nirvana, when he tries to continue his

imagine that somewhere along th line

effect on his life.

I certainly don’t see Davidson as
being a leader in any revolutionary
movement towards erradicating this
ridiculous practice so until we all
divorse ourselves from the fenters of
this. transient material world, I fear
the professors will just have to suffer
those attempts at labeling ones
self-G.P.A. acceptable, unless, or
course they don’t mind supplying the
world with more taxi cab drivers and
oragne packers who have to try to
find personal contentment with the
realization. that they have been en-
hanced and everyone just doesn’t
appreciate them (or did all Davidson
professors obtain their present posi-
tion with mediocre, institutionalized _
credéntials?).
