Catatonic Freshmen Seek Counselors

Tripping down my hall after
yet *another endless study
break, I lard a moan oozing
from nty hall counselor’s
room. «

* Amazed that any human oc-
curance could mar the calm of

a Davidson paragon-hall coun- ~

selor, I knocked on the door
and went in. Sprawled about
the room, all in a state of near
catatonic inaction were my
hallmates.

The one sound in the room
was the groan which‘had first
tugged at my better instincts,
issuing from Betty Jane’s
mouth, followed by the chant,
pre-med yes, pre-med no, pre-
med yes, pre-med no.

“Okay you all,” I com-
manded in my. best child
psychology voice and
toward the shade, ‘‘What you
need is a little light in here.”

“No, don’t!”’ a terrified wail
came from under one of the
beds. ‘‘Wait, wait—please. I
took Biology and I know what
those rays can do to you-—don’t

touch that blind. Quick, before
it’s too late, find a hole and
hide.”

“Uh, okay,’’ I said
carefully, “thow about a little
air freshener? Would you like
some nice raspberry patch
air?’’

“To the shelters! To the
shelters!” the biology student
under the bed cried.

“The more spray cans you
use, the more chlorofluoro-
methanes in the atmosphere

and the more chlorofluoro-.

methanes the more the
ozone’ level decreases,
and when that happens
we're all going to get skin
cancer—especially white Scots
like me.

“If we all go on spraying our
underarms blithely the ozone
level will be down by 30 per-
cent by 1994. Go, go, find a
shelter.’ We dropped the
flap of the cover and disap-

peared. .
“Sorry,” I apologized at the
empty bed, “I guess I just

ANNE FICKLEN
didn’t know the history behind
spray cans.”’
“History,’’ boomed a hollow

’ voice, “repeats itself.”

Searching for the per-
petrator of this cliche, I saw a
bundle of clothes which I had
assumed to be a pile of laun-
dry, sit up into a Hunranities
student.

“Well then you need only
take half as many notes,” I
quipped, trying to insert some

Imagine then our surprise
when, having reached

Arena and asked for

presentation of our govern-
ment-issued credit cards.

“Oh, I’m so sorry,’’ said the
ticket-seller. ‘The only seats
reserved for sub-citizens this;
year are in the sections

two buckets.

This statement astounded
us, since one of the
details, admittedly a minor
one, about our old seats was|
that we could see the game.

‘We inquired as to the
for the change in the seating
situation.

“Well, the government has

developed a new policy,” she

“Since those seats are con-
sidered so lucrative , they’ll be
sold to aristocrats. It is
estimated that this policy will
generate at least $39.16 in ad-
ditional revenue for the gover-
nment.”

“But why weren't we
notified about this new policy
and given a chance to argue
its merits in public?”’

“Oh, there was a public
meeting. It was held last sum-
mer; the government thought
that that would be a good time
to hold it since people don’t
have as much work then as
during the winter and thus
have more time to attend such

“And of course there are so

‘“‘Right!”’ she exclaimed.
“And to attract even more at-

at 3:00 A.M.; that way, those
who had to work during the

“You see, the government
conducted things right out in
the open, as usual, to insure
public approval of the new
policy. The government really
does have your best interests
at heart, you know.”’

“Maybe so. It just seems a
shame that we won’t be able to
support the team as much
anymore. But we should
probably remember the motto
of Kingdom Come: Money is
Everything.”
“That’s the spirit!” she
cried. “‘Things really aren’t so

Here are your tickets. Oh, by
the way, since there won’t be
as many seats for sub-citizens,
you'll have to sit two to a

A panting behind me,
previously masked by Betty

specimen in the corner. On
closer analysis, it proved to be
my roommate.

“What’s wrong with you,

my usual sensitivity.

“Just fulfilled all gym

“How, how?” I pleaded,

She turned “The

Davidson PIRG StopsTilting Windmill,
Tent Ripping Cripples Outing Club.

To the Editor:

Recent and current articles
in The Charlotte Observer and
THE DAVIDSONIAN have
been concerned with a project
of NC PIRG’s Davidson Chap-
ter--the courtwatching

project.

These articles have shown
that PIRG is no longer con-
cerned with tilting at wind-
mills and Duke Power.

The courtwatchers from
Davidson have learned a great
deal about justice as it is prac-
ticed in this area.

They have also been given
an opportunity to demonstrate
the concern for the com-

munity which is supposed to

be a part of the Davidson way
of life.

The courtwatchers will ask
the General’‘Assembly to enact
new laws to reform the court
system. :

With this in mind, I hope
that more students will be in-

terested in continuing the
project on a larger scale after
Christmas.

The local PIRG has several
options for community in-
volvement for those not in-
terested in the reform of the
courts. The ‘‘Wastehunt”’
project gives students a chan-
ce to contribute a very real
benefit to the effort to solve
the energy. shortage--which
should concern us all. :

try to demonstrate that there

are ways for .students -at-

‘Davidson to influence in some
small way the world in which
they live. 6

It is also to give PIRG a
plug, and to suggest that
PIRG at Davidson be thought

of as an organization for those
interested in doing projects of
meaning and value, rather
than as a band of wild-eyed
radicals.

To the Editor:

‘We, as Davidson students,
have been told that the cam-
pus community is built on a
foundation of trusf, honesty,
and integrity. The actions of
certain individuals Thursday:
night, Dec. 12, call such beliefs
into question.

The Outing. Club recently
purchased a set of tents so
Davidson students could go
camping without having to
purchase this expensive
equipment. This service was
crippled thanks to ‘the
thoughtless actions of the
aforementioned individuals.

The tents had been erected
so that the seams could be

- tions to

waterproofed. This is a simple
process, but it required us.to
leave the tents standing over-
night.

During the night, someone
came through the tentsite,

_ resulting in the breaking of

cords .and the ripping of the
tents. We shall allow such ac-
for themselves.

The Outing Club has been
hoping to provide a number of
useful services. The actions of
these persons. » though, could

It is up to the Davidson com-
munity to put a stop to such
prerequisite for maturity. Let
as students, strive to
display a higher . caliber of
values by insuring that we are
not the cause of such irrespon-
sibility in the future.
