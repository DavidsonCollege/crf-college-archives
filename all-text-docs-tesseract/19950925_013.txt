Crusading to Make

Davidson A Funnier Place
“Right Here, Right Now” asks for reader input

By JORDAN DEBREE
& Nick PAuL
Staff Writers

Good evening. A few weeks
ago you may have stumbled across
a peculiar little interview titled
“The Thrilla From Manila.” This
was no chance accident. We, Nick
Paul and Jordan deBree, of sound
mind and body, want to make a
Statement. We want the world to
know that Davidson College isn’t
just about books and studying. We
don’t just think about derivatives,
complex biological organisms, the
literary significance of War And
Peace or the strategical value of
Borneo to American interests. We
are fascinated by other things too,
and of course we have certain ques-
tions. This column is all about
these questions; what do students
really think of dorm bathrooms?
What kind of social life do our
librarians have? How do we char-
acterize the behavior of imbibing

students crammed around a beer
keg? Can people with no arms and
legs learn tae kwon do? (You
wouldn’t believe the answer to that
question.)

While you may not have
guessed from reading it, our last
article was supposed to be funny.
If you did not notice this, please go
back and read it again. If you still
do not notice this, it’s time to look
into the therapeutic value of ni-
trous oxide. “Right Here, Right
Now’ is all about what makes you
laugh. Actually, it’s about what
makes us laugh, which may en-
compass far more areas than is
traditionally recognized as normal
or communally shared. Neverthe-
less, we are here for you. We
viciously funny, devastatingly
handsome, and otherwise impec-
cably dressed gentlemen, are here
to provide you, the student body,
with a hearty chuckle.

We are two freshmen who
want nothing more than to provide

acolumn in the newspaper that can
act as a humor replacement for
those who are Farsidically chal-
lenged, Calvin Hobbesically im-
paired, or otherwise cartoon illit-
erate. We also want to be a sort of
interactive column. Soif you want
your faithful reporters to address a
certain issue, just give us a ring at
either 6364 or 6358. That is not to
say you can’t give us a ring for no
reason at all. Obviously we’d love
communication with our readers.
Leave rude messages. Tape re-
cordings are great. Give us your
name and number and we’ Il try to
send you some terribly gross re-
sponse. Possible topics in later
columns include: Bathroom Sur-
veys, Movie Review of Desperado
and The Political and Economic
Implications of World Bank Loans
to Third World Countries. (That
first idea is just a joke) Until next
time, we wish you all well. Please
know that we’re thinking of all of
you.
