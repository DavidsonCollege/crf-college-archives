One of the most annoying
aspects of life in our local
village is trying to drive
through Davidson at night.

Except for the afternoon
rush hour, Davidson’s traffic
is never very heavy. After 8:30
p.m. or so, it is very possible
to drive through town without
passing any other cars at all.
Yet, in the one quarter mile
stretch of Main Street down-

Davidson's red light district

town, there are no less then
four traffic lights--a formidible
barrier to anyone who would
prefer to travel more than 3
m.p.h.

“The Gentle One”’

_ The light at Main and the
road to I-77, at the entrance to
the parking lot behind Cun-
ningham Fine Arts Building,
is the most merciful of the four
traffic lights. If there is no
other traffic, a driver ap-
proaching the light from I-77
or from the Cunningham
parking lot will-find ‘The
Gentle One’’ red, but will trip

it green and be on his way ina

couple of seconds.

For all of the drivers on
Main Street ‘‘The Gentle One”’
will always be green (again,
assuming no interfering traf-
fic). Davidson students find
this traffic light to be green
and highly reasonable almost
every time.

At first, the light at the
other end of town also appears
to be quite reasonable. (There
is an obvious purpose for the
light there.) The intersection
of the road up to the Elemen-
tary School and Main Street is
probably the’ most confusing
and dangerous intersection in
town.

Also, it is sometimes a good
idea to slow down traffic from
Cornelius before it cruises into
the congested area of town--
but this can’t be much af a
factor at night when there is
no other traffic. Still, there is
almost no way for Cornelius
traffic to beat this light and
then the next one, even at
night. It guards the hallowed
avenues of campus well, and
thus its nickname, ‘‘St. Pete.’”’

“Peter” religiously follows a
timed sequence for its changes
from red to green and back.
This light is untrippable. Of
course, many times the driver
from the south will find it
green. The only trouble is,
when this light is green, the
one at Concord Road will
usually be red. Only if he hits

St. Peter’ right after it has.
switched from red to green will
the driver hit the next lights
green as well.

Peter principle

Whether you hit the light at
this fortunate moment: is a
matter of sheer luck. On the
other hand, if you happen to
hit ‘‘Peter” red, the best
policy, even if you are impa-
tient, is to wait for it to turn
green. By then accelerating
up to about 40 m.p.h., you

should hit the light at Concord
Road yellow and the next two
lights green. This may not
work for slower cars. (This is,’
of course, not recommended if
police cars are in open sight.)
You can ‘be sure’ of . this
because these next two lights
are locked into their patterns:
they can’t be trippéd either.:

Detour

The intersection at Concord
Road is. notable in that,
coming from the south, right
turns are -always permitted.
Som¢ students maintain that,
if you hit “‘Peter’’ late in one
of its green rotations, and then
find the Concord Road. light
red, you.can save time by
taking ‘a right and then
coming in the back door to the
campus through | Jackson
Court. If you chogse to stick
to the Main route to campus,
and wait through the red -at
Concord Street, you will prob-
ably just hit the next light red
as well.

‘‘Meetze’s Mealticket”’

It is ‘this next light, at
Depot Street, which is' perhaps
the most irritating of them all.
It: serves little: purpose in
terms of traffic. It has been
said that its sole purpose is to
stop motorists and visitors
where they will get the pret-
tiest impresion of the cam- .
pus’s appearance, and thus its

nickname, ‘‘Meetze’s Meal-
ticket.”
However, as pointed out

above, coming from the south -
you can be sure of hitting it.
green or of having avoided it
at Concord Street. Neither is
‘‘Meetze’s Mealticket” much
of a problem coming from the -
Main Street.campus exit.

If you hit this light red, by
pretending that its a blinking
red light (‘‘Blinking my eye-
lids a lot usually convinces
me,’’ said one student) and
going on through the inter-
section after checking for traf-
fic, the Concord Road light
and St. Peter will both be
green. If patrol cars are wat-
ching the road you may prefer
te restrain your imagination.
