By MARY AMOS

In tennis action the girls’
Varsity Tennis team added
four straight wins to their
record last week by defeating
Carolina, Salem, Pfeiffer, and
USC.

The girls’ team began their
winning streak by defeating
UNC-Chapel Hill 6-3 Tuesday.
Davidson collected four victo-
ries in the singles matches.

Number one pl#yer, Kirk
Cameron, defeated her oppo-
nent 6-4,7-6. Becca Stimson
lost her first set 4-6, yet rallied
to take he second set 7-6, and
the third 6-4.

Dea Booth, the number
three seed, and Andrea
Murphy, playing number six,
also won their matches.

In the doubles, Murphy and
Stimson won their number one
doubles match; as did the
number two team of Booth
and Sue McAvoy.

Coach Pat Drake is very
pleased with the performance
of the team. ’’They were
somewhat worried about Cha-
pel Hill, but once the match
began, the team gained confi-
dence, and proved they could

singles matches, although
there were several games
which were carried to three
sets.

Nancy Brown, number four
seed, won her first set 6-4, lost
her second 3-6, yet had a
strong come back in the third
set to win 6-0.

Stimson, number two player
remained undefeated in singles
action this year as she whip-
ped her opponent 6-4, 6-0.
Number four player, McAvoy,
won her first set 6-3, and after
a tie breaker, took the second
set 7-6. Brown, playing num-
ber five, and Murphy, number
six, also contributed singles
wins.

Davidson’s only win in
doubles action came from the
number one team of Cameron
and Stimson.

"The girls are gaining mo-
mentum with each match. I
just hope they can keep them-
selves sharp for the State
tournament next week in Cha-
pel Hill,” said Drake in sum-
ming up the week’s win.

The team will meet Wake
Forest on April 19, and will
travel to Chapel Hill for the
State Tournament April 22

Muench cites this as part of
the season for losses to Wake
Forest and William and Mary.

The Cats outhit the Demon
Deacons of Wake Forest last
Thursday, yet only produced
one run.

The Deacons used their hits
more effectively, and scored

: six runs.'Senior hurler Joel
Tew was saddled with the loss

which dropped his season re-
cord to 2-6.
Tew’s sub-par performance

|. this year has puzzled both

Muench and him.

Although the Cats have a
poor overall record they have
played well in conference
games. The team traveled to
Williamsburg last weekend
with a 4-4 conference record.

After losing the first game
of a doubleheader with the
William and Mary Indians
4-0;the Cats bounced back to

' win the second game 8-2, and

they returned to Davidson still

at the .500 level.

Mike Hall, the team’s most
consistent pitcher this season,
pitched well against the In-
dians according to Muench,

but he received no support
from his hitters.

The Cat batters managed
only three hits, and advanced
only one runner post second
base in the entire game.

The Cat’s outs boomed early
in the second game, however,
and after one inning the
Davidson led 4-0.

Stan Brown rapped three
hits, and drove in three runs to
run his team leading RBI total
to 15.

Freshman Ron Cannon
pitched a no hitter for five
innings before faltering
slightly in the sixth inning and
allowing two runs.

The Wildcats will play N.C.
State in Charlotte at Griffith
Stadium Friday at 1:30 pm.
