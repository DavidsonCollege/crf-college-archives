SO YEARS OLD

Che Havidsunian

By Alex Crumbley

These early years of The
Davidsonian stand at the midpoint
of Davidson’s life so far. Eighty
years ago, and 77 years after the
founding of Davidson, a group of
11 men led by Francis William
Price, the first editor-in-chief, had
their motion to establish a weekly
newspaper approved by a vote of
the student body. Thankfully, the
staff elected to name the paper The
Davidsonian rather than the Haka-

Raka, as one student suggested.

War and fire

The first years of The David-
sonian were exciting years in the
history of the United States and of
Davidson. Woodrow Wilson, a
former Davidson student, occupied
the Oval Office for most of this
decade and led his country to a
successful campaign in World War
Les
The old Chambers building
burned in November of 1921, and
in 1923 the college began building
new Chambers, which, at the time,
was called “The most modern col-
lege building in the South.” Watts
dormitory burned ona March night
in 1923, and neighboring Rumple
‘dorm was narrowly saved from
also going aflame by student ef-
forts to hold the Watts fire at bay.
The paper reflects the stern
attitudes of wartime—little humor
found its way onto its pages (which
some would say is still true), and
Students were always referred to
by initials and last name. Only 308
students attended the college in
1915, and the town was so close-

knit that information such as “Miss
Alice McCullas, of Raleigh, is vis-
iting here for a few days as the
guest of Miss Ann Payne,” were
considered newsworthy.

World War I

Davidson definitely did its
share to help with the war effort.
After the U.S. entered the war in
April, 1916, 156 students and 576
alumnienlisted in the armed forces,
and of these, 21 died and 366 be-
came commissioned officers.
Many others spent their time work-
ing on supply production farms in
the area.

Davidson began officer train-
ing oncampus, and Watts, Rumple,
and Georgia dorms served as bar-
racks for student soldiers.

We do love our basketball ,

_ But other aspects of campus
life weren’t so different from now.
Basketball was always an event at
Davidson, even in 1918, in the
midst of World War. A front-page
write-up of an intramural game,
called “the best basketball game of
the season,” described Company
C defeating Company B in a thrill-
ing one-point victory.

By our standards, though, it
probably wasn’t so thrilling. It
seems that both teams could have
used some work on shooting, as
the final score was 12 to 11.
When were the good old days?

Student concerns don’t seem
to have changed much, either.
When we think of the good old
days, we conjure up images of

simple times, with none of the com-

petitiveness of today’s post-col-
lege world. But the beginning of
an editorial in a 1915 issue of The

Davidsonian suggests that the col- .

lege senior 80 years ago had the
same complaint.

“According to the statistics
gathered by The Davidsonian last
fall, 158 of the students enrolled at
Davidson have decided what call-
ing or profession they expect to
enter. The remaining 150 have
either not decided or are delaying a
definite decision.

When none of the professions
were crowded and a man of ordi-

narily good education could be
successful in most any one, the
question of a young man’s life
work was not as perplexing as it is
today. Every modern field of work
is calling for only the best. This
increases the importance of care-
fully weighing the opportunities of
the various callings and their dif-
ferent demands upon the powers
and talents that a man may pos-
sess.”

For all the changes our school
has seen in 80 years, one thing has
stayed the same-- we no idea what
to do when we leave.

We still debate about the
brevity of Woodrow’ Wilson’s
Davidson career. Did he not like
our school? Did he flunk out?
Why did he go to Princeton after
his freshman year here?

The first issue of The David-
sonian contained an article which
addressed these questions and of-
fered the following explanation.
Describing a meeting between the
President and Davidson’s Presi-
dent Martin, the editor noted,

“He (Wilson) also expressed
regret that ill health had com-
pelled his withdrawal from
Davidson at the end of his fresh-
man year.

This is a clear explanation of
the facts connected with his leav-
ing, which is a matter that has not
been fully understood by every
one before.” :

The paper was always very
supportive of Wilson, consider-
ing him one of our own, and dedi-
cated an issue to him in 1921,
when much of the country turned

on him and his idea for the League

President Wilson

Wilson

of Nations. The front page stated
simply, “We are proud of you,
Mr. Wilson.”

Whatever the conditions of
his premature departure, Davidson
students ‘felt a special kinship
with President Wilson. An edito-
rial from December 9, 1914, said
it best: “Davidson men are proud
that their college could with but
one year’s training place in the
Presidential chair one who has
left such a worthy record behind
him.”
