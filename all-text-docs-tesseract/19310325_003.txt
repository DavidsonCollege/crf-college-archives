SEASON TO-DAY

Wildkittens Will Meet
Belmont Abbey Today

First Game Will Test the Strength
of Coach Laird’s Yearling Nine

KOONCE SHOWS UP WELL

Next Game is to be Played With
Charlotte High

This afternoon at 3 o’clock the Davidson
Wildkittens will meet their first test on the
diamond when they encounter the nine from
Belmont Abbey. Nothing is known of the
strength of these boys, but they always give
the Davidson Freshman team a real battle
on the sandlot. Last year the team from
Belmont eked out a 11-10 victory over the

Wildkittens. ;

The yearling nine is looking good this |
year, but not as good as usual. Behind the
plate Coach Laird has Boyd Morris as
first-string and McLemore as Morris’ un-
derstudy. Both of these men look goed in|
practice, according to Coach Laid. There |
are five men out for pitcher this year. They |
are Koonce, Lineberry, Hudspeth, Holland, |
and Burks. Of this quintet the only one |
that shows great promise is Koonce. How- |
ever, the others are improving steadily and |
will, in all probability, develop into good |
boxmen. At first base, McLean and Smith |
are having a little battle to determine who!
is the better of the two; at the present writ- |
ing McLean has the call over Smith. Blan- |
ton seems to have the keystone sack all to |
himself, as there is no stiff competition of-
fered him at this position. At shortstop there |
is another battle with Smyre and Armstead |
the competitors; at present Smyre seems to!
be the better of the two and will start in- |
stead of Armstead. The hot corner is held |
down by Gladstone and Grant with Glad- |
stone holding the upper hand in this fight. |
The three positions in the outfield are sought |
for by five men, Wilson, Alexander, Casali, |
McClintock, and Harrington. Wilson and |
Alexander hold the call over the other three, |
but it is not known as yet who will he the |
third man in the outfield. As a whole, the
outfield does not look very good, but Coach
Laird is fastly rounding them into form for |
the first game of the season. |

Following the Belmont Abbey game to- |
day the Freshmen will meet the- Mount |
Pleasant team tomorrow at 3 o'clock. Noth- |
ing is known as yet of the strength of this
team, but they are always known to have a}
good team and the Freshmen cannot let up|
on this game. Then on Monday the Wild-
kittens will encounter the Charlotte High
team. This year Charlotte has a very good |
team, probably as fine a team as it had last
year. Last year they played the Wildkittens
to a 9-9 tie. This game will be played in
Charlotte, probably at 3 o'clock.

Tentative line-up for Davidson Freshmen |
for the Belmont Abbey game:

Pitcher—Koonce. |
Catcher—Morris.
First base—McLean.
Second base—Blanton. |
Shortstop—Smyre. |

Third base—Gladstone.

Outfield—Wilson, Alexander, and either |
Casali, McClintock, or Harrington. |

This line-up will be the same for. the other |

two games with the only change being the |

pitchers.

Try This One

The following problem was pre-
sented by Prof. J. T. Kimbrough to
the Editor of The Davidsonian to be
published for the benefit of those
stridents who are mathematically in-
clined so that they may have the
opportunity to test their ability to
some extent. While it is true that it
is a brain teaser, it is possible to
work it. This is the problem:

A baseball diamond is a square,
90 feet on a side, and the distance
from the pitcher to the home plate
may be taken to be 60 feet: A base-
runner is 6 feet off of first base and
tries to steal second base; and he
can run at the rate of 261-4 feet
per second, starting two-fifths of a
second before the pitcher throws
the ball to the catcher. The pitcher
can throw the ball 100 feet per
second, and the catcher who is four
feet directly behind the plate can
throw the ball 90 feet per second
to second baseman; but the catcher
takes two-fifths of a second to get
the ball off. The second. baseman is
standing 3 feet away from second
on the path to first. It takes him
one fifth of a second to apply the
ball to the runner who is sliding
under him, Is the runner safe or
out?

Eight Matches Are

In Tennis Schedule

A schedule of eight matches and the State
Tournament has been arranged for the ten-
nis team under the managership of J. L.
Hall. Though arrangements for several more
matches are penidng, with Citadel and Se-
wanee, they are not definite enough to war-
rant announcement.

On April 21, Duke will be met in the first
match of the season at Durham. Then on the
following day Carolina will be played at
Chapel Hill. From the 23rd through the
25th Duke is host to the State Tournament.
Following the tournament, there will be a
northern trip, during which Wake Forest,
on the 27th; V. P. I. on the 28th; Washing-
ton and Lee on the 29th, and the University
of Virginia on. the 30th, will be met.

N.C. State Track Team
Opens Wildcats’ Season

First Dual Meet Features Part in
Saturday’s Junior Speaking
Program

KEEN RIVALRY EXPECTED

State Brings Outstanding Middle
Distance Men of South

On Saturday, March 28, the Davidson
track team will compete against State Col-
lege in the first meet of the season for either
team. The meet is scheduled for 2 o'clock on
Richardson Field, and it is expected that an
unusually large crowd will be present, espe-
cially those guests who are coming up for
Junior Speaking week-end.

Since State has engaged in no previous
meet this season, the quality of its track
team cannot be estimated, but the usual
brand of good athletes is expected. It has
been reported that State has many promis-
ing Sophomores on its team besides a num-
ber of veterans.

Davidson's track team this year is one of
unusually high calibre, being composed of
many lettermen from last year, and several
Sophomores who won their numerals on last
year’s Freshman team. This is also the first
meet of the season for the Wildcats, only
three men having engaged in the non-con-
ference meet held in Chapel Hill on March
6. These men, Fleagle, George, and Kuyken-
dall, scored eight points, tying P. C. for
first place. .

As this issue goes to press, no tryouts for
the coming meet have been held, but it is
expected that the following men will par-
ticipate in their respective events: 100-yd.
dash, Captain McCall, Fleagle, and Kuyken-
dall; 440-yd. dash, McGehee and Tyack;
880-yd. dash, Neal, Drake, and Cannon; the
mile, Earle and Howard; two-mile, Bran-

The team will take a nine-day rest before
further competition when they meet V. P. I.
and Erskine in the first series of home
matches on the 9th and 12th of May, re-
spectively.

This week will see the beginning of the
Freshman tournament. The Freshman team
will be largely determined by the results of
the tournament. Jim Halverstadt is in charge

Charlotte -Hi at

Before the next issue of The Davidson-
ian comes out, we shall know with a
pretty definite certainty just how all four
of Davidson's major teams will fare this
spring. The track team has yet had no
severe test, but their meetings with
State, Furman, and Duke in rapid succes-
sion will test them to, the utmost. The
balleball team, too, meets Carolina and
other strong teams and Davidson follow-
ers will find just how strong this year’s
nine is.

The freshmen, too, will run up against
strong competition on both the track and
diamond, April will see some one of
Davidson's teams in action almost every
day.

The fifth annual high school track meet
vent off with a great deal of success, in
spite of the bad weather. Not that it mat-
ters any, but have you ever seen one of

{non and Murphy; high jump, Allen, George,
and Wilson; broad jump, McCall and
George; pole vault, Flinn, Roane, Stroud,
and Brock; weights, Boyle, Hall, and Wag-
ner; high and low hurdles, George, McCal-
lic, and Little; javelin, McCall, Arnold, and
McCullough.

the high school meets that it didn’t rain?
Charlotte won the meet again, but this
time with more gusto than was expected.
Their strength in the weight events was
enough to offset the division of points to
other schools on the track. Charlotte was
strong enough to win first and second in
three events, and piled up other points to
almost double their nearest competitor,
High Point.

Golf and tennis are coming back strong
now with the coming of spring. It is al-
most impossible to get a tennis court at
about four thirty on any pretty afternoon,
and as for golf, dodging flying balls from
other people's club enhances the sport of
the contest.

Both varsity teams have already
scheduled good trips and have meets with
a number of strong teams. Tryouts for
the tennis team will be under way soon
after spring holidays. The golf team try-
outs will doubtless be completed soon.
Letters are being given in both these
sports now, putting them on equal foot-
ing.

The varsity baseball team is rapidly
rounding into shape, but pitchers are still
in need. Coach Younger is fairly certain
about six of his nine positions, but short
stop and third base can still be said to be
open for competition. Armfield, Proctor
and Goodson are rather certain of their
old posts at catcher, first and second, re-
spectively. Doc Mathis and Hub Coving-
ton will likely patrol left and right fields,
unless they get jobs as batterymen.
Mathis has been showing up nicely as a
pitcher, and is likely to be one of the reg-
ulars on the hurling staff. Covington is
understudy to Armfield behind the bat.
Bradsher will likely be the third man in
the outfield.
Mills has been showing up well at
short and he is perhaps an even break
against the field for the place. Bernhardt
and McCoy are staging a hard fight for
