“If the Trustees would send
a committee to me right now,”
he continued, “and give me
blanket authority, I would have
to say that I wouldn't know
what to do. This is not a simple
thing.”

The Deon squeiched a cam-
pus rumor that a dance week-
end curfew had been pro-
posed by some members of
the faculty. “! have no of-
ficial information concerning
this.

“I have not missed any facul-
ty meetings and would certain-
ly have known about it if any-
thing had taken place. Of
course I cannot’ predict what
action might be taken.

“There are problems to be
solved here but I am not push-
ing the adoption of a curfew.
I do not think a curfew would
solve any problems because
dates could be kept out of town
if students wanted to get
around it, and reguation of this
would necessitate other restric-
tions that would be undesira-
ble.”

Concerning the drinking rule.
Bailey said, “I think the in-
terpretation of “under the in-
fluence’ is somewhat hazy and
I don’t think it should be that
way.

“However, the best courts
in the land are trying to de-
termine exactly what ‘under
the influence’ means.

_ “The situation,” stated the
Dean in regards to after dance
parties “is dangerous. If there
was some unfavorable occur-
rence in some of the locations
frequented, the Davidson ad-
ministration, or any other ad-
ministration in a similar situa-
tion, would be forced to act.

“The students should. realize
the seriousness of the situation.

Again I must say that I do not
know the best answer but feel
obligated to work toward ob-
taining it.”

Bailey then commented on
the Trustees relation to these
probloms. “There are certain
individuals on the Board of
Trustees that are concerned,
but they expect the faculty to
handle it directly. They have
not taken any official action.

“However, a committee was
appointed last year to study the
problem, but so far as I know
there were no specific recom-
mendations.

“1 do not know what is in
their minds concerning this

matter. They do have the ulti-'
mate legal responsibility for

the College.

“Also there has been no of-
ficial faculty decision concern-
ing these problems this year
although several members are
concerned.

“A trustee or faculty de-
cree is not enough, however.
The students should realize
what an unfavorable incident
could do and should co-ope-
rate to work things out.”

Bailey’ commented that he
felt student-faculty relations
have been improved this year.
adding that he considered it a
“very good year” in that. re-

Bill Whitesell, Freshman Advisor to the Class of
1963, has announced the names of the group counsellors
for next September. He discussed the plans for Orienta-
|tion Week, September 10-15.

“Our main job is to see that
the entire program comes off
smoothly.” said Whitesell, He
cited a few minor changes to be
made in the plans of last year.

“We'll inelude a tatk about
the Honor Court, along with
one about Student Govern-
ment in general,” he said.
This is in addition to com-
ments made to incoming
freshmen by faculty and stu-
dent members of various de-

on campus.

NO. 28

By TOMMY COLVIN

Davidsonian News Editor
At its regular meeting last Monday at 10:00. p.m.

the IFC passed the regulations for next year's rush week.
Included in these regulations are several new rules which
will alter several aspects of rush week.

The biggest change concerns
ithe beginning of dorm rushing.
‘Although next year’s freshmen
|will arrive on campus Thurs-
day, September 10, no dorm
i rushing will be allowed until
' 8:00 a.m. on Saturday. Septem-
‘ber 12. IFC president Ward Me-
Keithen stated. “This is to al-
‘low d freshman to get tempo-
rarily settled before rushing be-
gins.”

The IFC passed two other ad-
ditions to the rushing regula-
lions.

One of these requires that
“no rushing will be carried
out which would interfere
with orientation.”

The other states that “no fra-
ternity member or pledge shail

|any violations of this section to
|the IFC for consideration.”

The regulations concerning
‘rush parties are the same as
last year. Confirmation for rush
parties will take place Monday
in Chambers Auditorium under
the direct control of the IFC.
Rush parties will get underway
Monday night at 7:00 p.m.. con-
cluding Friday evening, Formal
pledging will take place be-
tween the hours of 3:00 to 4:30
p.m. on Saturday, September
19.

Next year the IFC will pro-
vide permanent name tags to
the rushees to be used dur-
ing all rush parties. The IFC
is also considering removing

from the post office. This
would be done to avoid any
mixup in the dates for the
last six parties to be held on
Thursday and Friday.

The usual restrictions will
still be in effect. Any fraternity
which violates a rushing regu-
lation will be fined fifty dol-
lars.

Ward McKeithen announced
that the IFC would explain the
rushing regulations to the rush
chairmen at a meeting next
Tuesday.

The dates for the dance
weekends were also set at the
mecting. Homecoming will be
on the weekend of October 30-
31. Midwinters will take place
February 12-14, while Spring
Frolies will be held on April
22-24. President McKeithen
commented, “We are announc-
ing these dates a little early so
that everyone will have time
enough to get a date.”

The IFC discussed further
the possibility of having a
concert by some name group
after a football game next
fall. Other items discussed
during the meeting were pos-
sible new plans about the
scholarship trophy and the
trustee-fraternity tuncheons
to be held next week.

Questioned after the meeting
about plans for next year, pres-
ident McKcithen stated. “We
are planning to revise our con-
stitution next year.

“We have also decided to
withhold any discussion about
