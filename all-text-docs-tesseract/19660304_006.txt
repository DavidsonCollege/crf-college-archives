ARCHIE DAVIS
“Only Oursetves To Blame”

By BILLY FARR
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The 100 Davidson students who
have National Defense Educa-
tion loans may no longer be
able to receive such aid, accord-

President Johnson has not re-

Davis Firmly Defends
UNC Trustee Action

By ALLEN WEBB
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“We had to decide who is go-
ing to run the university.” re-
plied UNC trustee Archie K.
Davis in the coffee hour Tues-
day. °

He replied to a question about
the UNC trustee meeting the day
before in which they had agreed
almost unanimously to delegate
control to UNC officials over
visiting campus speakers.

Davis added, ‘Delegated re-
sponsibility is the concept by
which one runs a university.”

Venture

Termed ‘Successful’

Approximately 75 people ate
at the Union's special restau-
rant Saturday night during Mid-
winters, and Bill Beckham,
Union manager and coordinator
of the project, called it a “‘suc-
cessful venture.”

“We consider it successful,”
he said. “I was very encour-
aged by the attendance, and I’m
certainly agreeable to doing it
again.”

Beckham said that the sea
food, ‘shipped directly from
Boston,”’ was the most popular
item on the menu, followed by
the two dollar steaks.

The next opening of the res-
taurant, dubbed “‘The Hungry
D,” will be the March 12 con-
cert weekend, with subsequent
openings later this spring.

Mike Bates won the “Name
the Restaurant Contest’ spon-
sored by the Social Council al-
though his title was not actually
selected. Bates, the only partici-
pant in the contest, submitted
nearly 50 names, and Beckham
promised him a-steak dinner.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, super-
visor of dormitories, later sug-
gested ‘The Hungry D.”

earlier addressed chapel as a
representative of the banking in-
dustry and warned of the ser-
dous threat to the nation’s dual
system of state and federal
banks resulting from the ‘‘dere-
liction of responsibility at the
state and local levels.”

Davis assessed the situation as
only one facet of a greater ten-
dency toward centralization; a
trend for which ‘‘we have only
ourselves to blame.”

Although proving with figures
the tremendous growth since
1900 in the population of North
Carolina, agricultural produc-
tion, electrical power and ag-
gregate personal income, Davis
explained that the. figures .are
still not high enough and that
the problems for the state are
still numerous.

He pointed out the “crying
need in agriculture for supple-
mentary income” and the fail-
ure of many counties to sup-
port public education adequate-
ly.

‘We have only begun to
scratch the surface,’’ said Davis
and pointed out that the grow-
ing tendency toward centraliza-
tion is aggravating these prob-
lems.

The federal government is im-
patient with these failures at the
local and state levels and is
assuming responsibilities that
the states have neglected.

To check this tendency, ad-
vised Davis, we must think in
terms of state development of
natural resources with a sense
of responsibility.

FRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1966

The NDEA loan program,
which was begun in 1958, has
been a most important part of
the financial aid program at
Davidson. Over $200,000 has
been loaned through the school
since initiation of the program,
White said. The plan could be-
come self-sustaining in a few
years, for money is now being
repaid into the fund with the
former borrowers showing ‘‘a
fantastically good repayment
record,” White continued.

As it now stands, however,
the college will not have the
funds available to effect this,
since Johnson has not request-

ed an extension of the program.

In its place. the President has
proposed a guaranteed Joan sys-
tem, in which the money for
loans would be provided by pri-
vate banks and insurance com-
panies and guaranteed by the
Federal and state governments.
North Carolina has instituted
such a state loan program. “I
do not think this will serve the
same purposes in the same
way,” White said.

Under the proposed program,
there would be no assurance
that the most needy students
would receive aid. Since more
students would be technically

eligible, there might also be an
insufficient amount of loan
money available from the pri-
vate companies involved.

Furthermore, the new plan
would not be as useful to the
student in making his decision
where to attend college. As it
now stands, loan money through
NDEA can be made available
to the student almost concurrent-
ly with the acceptance.

Under the new program, a
greater time lapse would be
necessary, perhaps forcing a
student to make a decision with
incomplete knowledge of his po-
tential funds.
