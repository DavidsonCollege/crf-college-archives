The football prospects at this time
are most favorable. All of last year's
team, with the exception of A. M. Mc-
Keithan, who graduated last spring, will
be in college the coming year. Coach
Fetzer, who has been in charge of the
boys’ summer camp near Brevard, N.
C., will return to Davidson next week.
Active practice will begin with the open-
ing of college or perhaps even earlier.
In addition to such a wealth of old ma-
terial, much new material, out of the
extra large class that enrolls this fall, is
sure. Not until near the time of the
first game will the personnel of next
year's team be known. All candidates
for the team, both old and new, are put
on an equal footing. It should be said
that every footbail team should have
two or three men who can play any
Varsity position well, so the number of
openings for candidates is large when-
ever this fact is taken into consideration.

Next year’s team will be captained
by B. N. White, who for the past two
years has played a brilliant game at cen-
ter. Fight and “pep” he has to an un-
usual degree. A. B. Reese will manage
the 1916 delegation.

The schedule as printed above calls
for several hard games early in the sea-
son. The first three teams which Dav-
idson meets are usually contestants for
All-South Atlantic honors. The one
radical changd from the schedule of
previous years is the Thanksgiving game.
For the past six years Davidson has
met Wake Forest in Charlotte for the
Turkey Day contest. This year she
meets Clemson, a team which she has
tied for the past two vears.

Below is given a copy of the athletic
regulations now in force at Davidson:

1. No one shall represent Davidson
College in any athletic contest except
under the following conditions:

(a) He must satisfy the Faculty
Committee on Athletics that he is a
bona fide student of the college, and
that he is taking at least twelve hours
per week on class of regular college
courses, and that he is maintaining the

New Men Welcomed
By Y. M. C. A.

A Warm Reception Awaits New
Students.

To the Class of ‘20:

The cabinet and members of the Y.
M. C. A. take this opportunity to ex-
tend to you a cordial welcome to the
student body and to assure you that we
are at your service in any way that may
be desired.

Knowing the confusion which is al-
ways attendant upon the opening of col-
lege and realizing that you are strangers
in a strange place, the Y. M. C. A. has
a regular committee whose members
will meet the incoming trains and will
conduct you to the campus where they
will assist you in getting registered, and
then show you to your rooms in the re-
spective dormitories. This committee
will be composed of men who have been
in college for several years and who

twill be able to give you accurate infor-

mation. Members of this committec
will wear badges at the trains so that
you may identify them.

On the Monday after college opens
there will be held in Shearer Hall a
rally meeting of the student body at
which the different phases of student
activities on the campus will he taken
up and outlined for che benefit of the
new men. This is intended to give them
information about the departments of
college life with which all of the stu-
dents come in contact throughout. the
vear. Each of these topics will be dis-
cussed by men who have taken a leading
part in Athletics, the Y. M: C. A.
The Davidsonian, the Magazine, the
Annual, the Literary Societies, the Stu-
dent Body government, etc.

Immediately following this meeting
a reception will be given to the new
class. “he members of the faculty and
a number of the people of the town will
be present and an opportunity will be
given each man to become acquainted.

As soon as possible after the first
rush of opening, the Y. M. C. A. is
planning to take up the work that has
been outlined for the coming year. This
will consist of work in the territory sur-
rounding Davidson as well as in the
town itself, and will comprise mainten-
ance of Sunday schools, night schools,
surveys, and extension work, as well as
committee work on the campus, weekly
religinys meetings on Thursday nights.
and th® maintenance of a Social Center
which serves as a lounging room for the
students where they may read, study, or
enjoy games and music.

Each of you ts coming to college in
order to equip yourself for life and to
acquire what is termed an education,
In order that this education may be as
broad and of as satisfying a character
as possible it must be of the kind which
educates the mind, the body, and the
spirit, the three component parts of the
human being, whoever he may be. The
college curriculum offers an opportunity
for the development of the mind, .he
athletic field an opportunity for the de-
velopment of the body, and the Y. M.
C. A. an opportunity for the develep-
ment of the spiritual side. The work
of which the Y. M. C. A. has charge
offers an opportunity for practical work

Timely Information
For New Students

No. 1

to Old Men

President Martin Writes Frank|Dr. Martin Writes Appreciatively

Letter to Class of 1919.

You, who are expecting to enter
Davidson College next month for the
beginning of your college course, will be
interested to hear that your class prom-
ises to be a large one. Up to date more
new students than. ever before in the
same period of time have been accepted.

Let nothing interfere with your com-

ing, if your certificate has been approv-|

ed. The college was never better
equipped to serve you and much = has
been done this summer to improve the
plant and make it more efficient.

Be sure to come on time. Late en-
trance badly handicaps a student, and,
unless it is necessary, all new students
should be here to matriculate on ‘Tues-
day, the 5th of September, as there will
be some congestion on Wednesday, the
6th. It is well to have a day to look
about, get your bearings, and become
settled.

Committees from the student organi-
zations will meet you at the trains and
aid you in finding vour rooms, “They
will direct vou to Mr. Jackson, — the

Business Manager, to whom you will

pay your dues and secure your room key.
You then report at the President's office
for matriculation. We shall be glad to
welcome you and have you share with
us all the advantages. opportunities and
pleasures that the college offers. Come
prepared to do your best during the en-
tire year and to make the right start to
that end, and you will find that Faculty
and old students alike will appreciate
your earnestness and honor you for it.

Please understand that T shall alwavs
he glad to see you and talk over with
you any problems of interest, which you
would like me to consider with vou. 1
am entirely at your service. This
true of cach member of the Faculty as
well,

Hoping and expecting to meet you
the opening, T am,

Sincerely yours,
Wo. J. Martin,

President.

ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB.
The manager of the College Orches-
tra and Glee Club wishes to ask all of
the new men who play anv musical in-
strument to bring same with them and
to answer the call for practice which
will be issued soon after college opens.
This organization is composed strict-
lv of Davidson students and furnishes
the music for entertainments on the
Hill, Senior and Junior Speaking and
Commencement. In addition — several
trips throughout parts of North and
South Carolina are taken cach year.
The manager states that two good trips
are already planned and that there may
be other short ones during the vear.
All men who can play a musical instru-
ment will be given an opportunity to
make a place in the organization. There
will be regular hours for practice.

To the old students: Have your
courses been so qrouped that you are
cure of a diploma? Examine the catalog.

New student? Read the catalogue.

Old Student? Peruse the catalogue.

We trust you have thoroughly enjoy-
ed your vacation and will come back
refreshed and invigorated for a good
college year. Every one united in ex-
pressing the belief that last year was one
of the most satisfactory in the history
of the college. We hope you will help
to make this a better year still. Some
changes were introduced in the Student
Body government and some others go
into effect this year; let every man do
his part in making them effective for
good to the whole body and to the in-
dividual student.

Te will pay vou before you come to
make a forecast of the coming year and
plan to get the most and the best out
of it.

First, what tickets you will take.
selecting them if possihle with reference
to your life work; how you will order
vour life so that each day’s work will
he thoroughly and promptly done, and
how all proper student activities which
widen your interest and give vou valu-
able experience may be so interlaced
with the class reay work as not to in-
terfere with this, the most important
feature of your college course,

Second, of what service vou may be
to your fellow student to help him make
the best use of his college opportunicy
Especially should this be true of your
attitude towards all new students. Re-
call your own sense of strangeness and
vour difficulty of the first three months
in adjusting yourself to your work.
Recall how any assistance or thoughtful
suggestion of an older brother in the
college body helped you and how you
possibly were hampered (it may be seri-
ously so) by. the thoughtlessness of
some of the older men. We all want
the new students to succeed from the
start. If they do, the chances are de-
cidedly in favor of their staving through
the whole four vears. This increases the
value of the college to them and their
value to.the student body and increases
the number of students. “Too many
drop out discouraged by the first two
months. The old students can do much
as elder brothers, to make this class
quite materially smaller and so make
glad many a home. — Before you return
then give quiet and serious thought to
both these problems: How can [ get
the best out of this college year, and
what can T do or not do to be the most
help possible to the younger men in
college?

Tf we will all plan our vear’s life in
this wav and live up to it. old David-
son will reach a new high-water mark
in effective service to the splendid body
of young men who enlist under her
banner,

A cordial welcome awaits vou.

Wa. J. Martin.
