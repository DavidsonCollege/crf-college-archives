Whereas, to stand still is to slip backwards, by
some devious logic, and whereas, Drivelson must main-
tain a tradition of change to meet the awesome needs
of the future, we of the Blue Fly Committee herein
propose a new curriculum revision to succeed the old
revision when the Philosophy Department gets tired
of the old plan.

Although we have not been appointed by the ad-
ministration, we feel we are eminently quaified;
Mr. Beard because of his charm, and Mr. Jones be-
cause he once told Earl MacCormac that he was wrong.
Therefore’ we propose the following changes:

RUSH
Rush shall be held the first week of the first
semester. All freshmen not getting bids will have to
go home. Thus we will have effective 100 per cent
affiliation.
DRINKING RULE

There will be compulsory drinking at least three
times a week.

LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT
In addition to Urdu, the other language having
immeasurable influence on Western culture which has
not been previously taught at Drivelson should be
taught, namely, Linear A.

FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP

Whereas, the benefits of female companionship
been deemed necessary for the proper transaction of
the educational process, and whereas, women have
been proclaimed to be the intellectual equals of men,
we conclude that the beneficial effect derived from
female companionship is the result of physical rather
than intellectual factors, namely, the differences in
anatomical structure.

We believe that such benefits could be most ef-
ficiently secured through the establishment of Dook
dormitory as a brothel.

Failing this—in that such differences will there-
fore be revealed to be inconsistent with the ideals of a
liberal education—we propose that such differences be
abolished.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES
All physical activities such as smoking, shining
shoes, auto driving, listening to records, idle talk,
shaving, card playing, eating, etc., being mundane and
fleshly and therefore inconsistent with the ideals of a
liberal education, should be forbidden on the campus
or in the town. i
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Student government, which pursues practical
rather than theoretical ends, and is therefore incon-
sistent with the ideals of a liberal education, should be

‘abolished.
THE ADMINISTRATION
The administration, which pursues practical rather
than theoretical ends, and is therefore inconsistent
with the ideals of a liberal education, should be

abolished.
CHRISTIAN COMMITMENT
In keeping with Drivelson’s Christian commitment,
at least one bona fide saint shall be included in each
freshman class.

ATHLETICS
In the light of the maxim, mens sana in corpore
sano, two years of Latin shall be compulsory, with nine
cuts allowed in a semester, all but five of which must
be made up. Part of this requirement may be met at

the lake campus.
SCHEDULE

The following holidays will be added to the
schedule: George Washington’s birthday, Thomas Jef-
ferson’s birthday, Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, Robert
E. Lee's birthday, Jefferson Davis's birthday, William
P. Davidson’s birthday, Chalmers Davidson's birthday,
Don Davidson’s birthday, Chet Davidson’s birthday
and James W. Reid Appreciation Day, which shall be
celebrated on the first day of classes.

CURRICULUM
Since there are 37.5 hours of instruction offered

for a three hour course, and there are 5 hrs, 50 mins.
in a class day, such a three hour course could be ef-
fectively taught in one week (six class days of six hours
each). Since the average Drivelson student takes five
courses each semester, or 10 courses each year, he
could complete a year’s work in 10 weeks.

In the light of these facts, we propose that the
schedule be revised, such that a semester course is
taught in one week, and that graduation requirements
be met in 41 weeks, that is, by the end of the freshman

ear.
’ A two-track program will be intiated: the student
may elect to graduate at the end of his freshman year
and go on to graduate school after the usual 14 week
summer vacation, or he may spend his sophomore,
junior and senior years engaged in prayer, meditation,
reading of scripture, throwing of frisbee, playing of
flickerball, rushing of fraternity and other activities
not deemed by this committee to be inconsistent with
the ideals of a liberal education.
EXTENDED RUSH
All students who do not get into Dook dormitory
when rooms are assigned will be given an opportunity
at extended rush.
Respectfully submitted,
The Blue Fly Committee

WASHINGTON (IPU) — Representative
J. Storm Burman, chairman of the House
Committee on Un-American Proclivities.
said Friday his committee has discovered
that black revolutionaries have been using
“soul, music’’ to communicate with their
followers.

“The lyrics to those songs carry special
meanings for revolutionaries," Burman
drawled. “For instance, the words ‘let me
wrap you in my warm and tender love’ really
mean let me zap you with my cold and hard
gun.”

Burman also reported that other songs
carry meanings too. For instance, “Dancing
In the Streets” refers to the riots that will
signal the revolution, and “Gonna Wait ‘Til
the Midnight Hour’ contains the key for the

Meaningless double talk is wordi-
ness.

A meaningless phrase is another
meaningless phrase.

However, meaningless phrase could
be soundless fury saying nothing.
Also, it is probably another meaning-
less phrase.

Again, if this meaningless phrase is
a meaningless phrase, then it will per-
haps seem to be a meaningless phrase.

Is a meaningless phrase really a
meaningless phrase? Not always.
Some meaningless phrases are parts
of meaningless sentences.

Therefore, the administration, fac-
ulty and students should unite in a
meaningless phrase, but the meaning-
less phrase should be positive and
constructive.

“That explains why Motown headquarters

The songs even list the cities to be burned,
said Burman. For example, the song ‘‘Danc-

including Baltimore, Philadelphia and De-

‘dancing in the street.”

“This is just anuthah éxample of the state
