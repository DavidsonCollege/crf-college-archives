for September 1, 1956. An artist’s conception of the four-story
structure is shown on the right. Interior furnishing will be similar
to the new Belk ODormitory.—(Photos by Daniel.)

States during the Colonial period will be displayed in the ball-
room of the College Union beginning Monday. These maps
were used by Dr. W. P. Cumming in a lecture at the Mint
Museum Sunday, September 25.

The maps are hoth rare and
beautiful. They include — the

fOrtelius “Florida” of 1584, the

earliest printed map to show the
interior of any part of the United
States; Collet’s North Carolina
(1770), the first map naming the
town of Charlottesburg: and the
great 1775 Mouzon North and
South Carolina, historically the
most important map in the collec-
tion because both George Washing-
ton and Cornwallis, with their gen-
erals, planned their Carolina cam-
paigns on Mouzon maps and it re-
mained the basis of all maps of
the Carolinas until well into the
nineteenth century.

Among other interesting items
in his collection are the Delisle
(1718), mother map of all later
maps of the Mississippi and the
first upon which the word “Texas”
appears, and two rare hydrographic
charts used by mariners to ap-
proach the Carolina coast.

Dr. Cumming is the author of

the first comprehensive reference
work on these early maps and
their makers, which is in the
process of publication by the
Princeton University Press.

He has also recently edited the
journal of John Lederer, the first
explorer of the North Carolina
picdmont, which will be published
this winter at the University of
Virginia.

His interest in colonial carto-
graphy began in 1931, when he
found in a London print shop a
copy of the Speed Carolina (1675)
which showed a huge lake cover-
ing northern Georgia and western
Carolina, and the Arenosa Desert
across Central North Carolina.
Searching the reasons for the
curious errors has led Dr. Cum-
ming into twenty years of fas-
cinating and constantly broadening
cartographical study.

JOINS WITH PRINCETON, U. VA.:

Davidson a Leader in
Wilson Commemoration

Davidson College will play a
major role in a national tribute to
her most distinguished alumnus
when the Woodrow Wilson Centen-
nial is observed in 1956.

As the first alma mater of the
late President, Davidson will join
with Princeton University and the
University of Virginia in special
activities this spring. Wilson at-
tended Davidson for one year, in
1873, and visited the campus while
he was the nation’s 27th President.

Dr. John R. Cunningham, David-
son president, said today that plans
for Davidson's role in the celebra-
tion are as yet incomplete, but will
include “at least one major ad-
dress from the college campus. Dr.
Cunningham is a member of the
National Citizens Council for the
Wilson Centennial.

The Woodrow Wilson Foundation
of New York is coordinator of Cen-
tennial programs, as _ lectures,
seminars and exhibits are being de-
veloped. Bernard M. Baruch key-
noted plens for the celebration in
may with an address entitled “Free-

dom for Man—A World Safe for
Mankind.”

Mr. Baruch emphasized that the
entire program is based on the im-
pact of Wilson's ideas today, rather
than a review of his role in na-
tional and international affairs.

Although at Davidson but a year,
Wilson was active in campus af-
fairs, and there are records of his
activities. He left in the spring be-
cause of illness, and attended no
college the following year because
of poor health. When he did return
to college he entered Princeton.

When Wilson was President and
his attendance at Davidson was a
popular topic for local discussion,

legend had it that he had been

anything but an exemplary student.
Some even said that he'd been
asked to leave because of a com-
bination of poor deportment and
poorer grades.

Actually, he was a good student
and had no black marks on de-
portment. He averaged 90 on such
subjects as Ancient Geography, La-
tin, Mathematics and Greek, played

in at least one varsity football
game and was a member of the
Eumanean Literary Society.

He was the son of a Presbyterian
minister, the Rev. Joseph R. Wil-
son, who was with the Columbia
Theological Seminary in Columbia,
S. C., when young Tom, as he was
then known, entered Davidson. The
elder Wilson later became a pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church
at Wilmington and served as a
member of the Davidson Board of
Trustees from 1874 to 1881.

It is likely that Wilson engaged
in his first public debate at David-
son, for he was a member of the
negative team that debated the
subject “Resolved: that Republican-
ism is a better form of government
than a Limited Monarchy.” It was
sponsored by the Eumanean
society.

A special section of the Davidson
College library is devoted to Wil-
son, his personal history and his

ideals.

FROM THE DEAN:

There has apparently been some
misunderstanding about the func-;
tion of the ushers at Vespers. The
ushers are there to be helpful to
visitors and students alike. How-
ever, it is the responsibility of each
individual student to be present
on time and to find s seat whether
or not an usher is present.

The following procedure will
hereafter be used at the vesper
service:

1) Any student entering the sanc-
tuary will be issued a white card
up until 7:30, at which time the
doors will be closed.

2) The doors will be opened again
for the seating of late-comers dur-
ing the first hymn. Students who
enter the sanctuary at this time
will be given blue cards. No cards
will be issued after the doors have
been closed for the second time.

In no case hereafter will cards
be issued to students who do not
enter the sanctuary and remain for
the service.

Samuel R. Spenrer, Jr.
Dean of Students

responsibility of each student to
go by and have his chest X-Ray
meade during the period the ma-
chine is here. There will be

students may sign up for defi-
nite times and minimize waiting

‘Y’ Membership Meeting

BY MAURICE CROUSE
Dr. Harry Moffett of Gastonia spoke on ‘The Cost of
Christian Discipleship” at the first YMCA membership meet-

ing of the year Tuesday night.

This meeting, held in’ the

Union Ballroom. was postponed fron: 7 o’clock to 8:15 so that
mathematics students would be able to attend.

Using examples drawn from his
varied experience as a univorsity
astor, Dr. Moffett illustrated his
text from Romans: ‘Don’t let the
world around you squeeze you in-
to its mold. but let God remold
you from within.” He noted that
many pressures found in state uni-
versities are net found at David-
son College. but he warned that

formalized religious services might] -

be¢ome quite as much a mold as
the attitude of the anti-religious.
He spoke of two molds which are
common or likely to be common
on college campuses The first is
the mold of the pious who “know
all the answers” and tend to judge
others by their own standards. A
second mold is the converse of
this: the identification of all
religion with the first group.
College is the period. in every-
one's life when one is being mold-
ed. he said. and it is necessary to

realize that no {wo persons fit the}

same mold exactly. He noted also
that many of the present-day molds
or prejudices are, being subjected
to great tensions and may change
radically.

Comparing the working of God
within the individual with the ris-
ing of a loaf of bread,-he made the
point that the bréad, and hence
the individual, was much the bet-
ter for not being squeezed into the
mold but overflowing it because
of an inward leaven.

Dr. Moffett spoke to the YMCA
membership after a devotional per-
iod had been led by Harold Mé-
Keithan Chairmen of the three
commissions outlined their pur-
poses and plans during the next

Fred Myers Speaks
To Eu Society Meeting

Eumancan Literary Society held
its first meeting of the year last
Monday night, October 3. Fred
Myers. who has recently returned
from a year of travel and study in
Europe, presented a number of
full color slides he took in France,
Italy and Spain.

Mr. Jim Marshall, newly elected
president of the Society, opened
the meeting with a statement to
the effect that he hoped Eumanean
would rentain the oldest organiza-
tion on the campus and he also
promised to deliver his inaugural
address at the next meeting.

The meeting then turned to new
business and Mr. Archie Joyner
was appointed parliamentarian. The
Society then voted to immediately
extend bids to several members of
the student body who were deemed
worthy of the distinction.

Mr. Tom Morgan, vice-president,
announced that next week's pro-
gram would consist of the reading
of three sophomore papers, one
each by Messrs. John Bernhardt,
Willard Wolfe, and Bob Sloan.

Mr. Myers presented his color
slides after which the president
adjourned the meeting.

DR. SCOTT REVEALS
PHYSICAL ED.
DEPT.'S NEW POLICY

Dr. Tom Scott. director of ath-
letics and physical cducation, has
announced a new policy for the
physical education program at Da-
vidson. All juniors and seniors who
have passed the physical fitness
test given to freshmen are imme-
diately excused from any further
required physica! (raining. Those
who have failed it must remain in
the program for the remainder of
the year

All sophomores must take this
test. next week and those who pass
will be excused at the end of this
year: all who fail must remain in
the required program for a third
yearor until such time as they are
able lo pass the test. Freshmen
must remain in physicial training
for a minimum of two years, and
if they have passed. the physical

approved by the committee.
faculty meeting on Tuesd:y. Octo-
ber 4, the entire faculty also ac-
cepted this proposal, but with one
amendment. That amendment being
that juniors and seniors would be
excused only if they had passed
the freshman physical fitness test.

There were two main reasons for
the proposal. according to Dr.
Scott First of all, approximately
half of the two upper classes are
already excused from P.T, because
they. are twenty-one, participants
jn some varsity sport, or are in ad-
vanced R.0.T7.C. Secondly, most
other colleges and universities in

and off the campus.

As for the Band Leader himself,
few American musicians have
created such a ferver of excite-
ment as Art Mooney. ‘His waxing
of “I’m Looking Over a Four Leaf
Clover” became a national institu-
tion, which won for him top posi-
tion in every type of musical poll
and catapulted him into the most
prominent position of the band
world.

Mooney is currently injecting
some of the old Glen Miller trade-
marks into his. music: the clarinet
leading the sax section; the
trumpets muted and thin, lending
to dreamy and easy listening.

Art’ Mooney makés no preten-
tions about his goal in the music
business His aim is simply to play
what the public wants. Sensing the
national nostalgia for music in the
Miller mood, Art began to re-stock
his hook with arrangements by men
lrke Jerry Gray and Norm Leyden,
both of whom at one time did

arranging for Miller. Mooney is not
trying to imitate the Miller style;
‘rather, he is incorporating into his
own music something that has long
become a national institution
