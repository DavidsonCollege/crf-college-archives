Stevens Happy With Progress
As Swimmers Open Season

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer

Davidson swimmers are
Starting to mold into a team
for competition in the meets
in December, January and
February. Most of the tank-
men have been working out
every afternoon since the mid-
dle of October and are starting
to get into shape for their
events.

The coach this year is Tom
Stevens who returns to David-
son after a year on sabbatical.

Looking ahead to the
season, Stevens commented,
“‘We have a tougher schedule
this year than we have had for
a while. We will be swimming
11 meets and in the Southern
Conference Meet at the end of
February.”

Stevens seems pleased with
the team. He remarked, ‘‘We
are short on numbers, but the
swimmers we have are
working hard.”’

There are several returning
tankmen who are looking good

Track Construction Begins,
Martin Pleased With Move

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sperts Editor

Construction has begun in
the first phase of Davidson
College's Uniroyal  All-
Weather Track.

At the present time men are
at work building a drainage
system that is necessary for
the type of track that the
college is having put in.

Don L. Winston, director of
development, explained that
the track could not have been
financed without the money
from the Heath Whittle Track
Fund, honoring the former
long-time coach of Davidson
track and cross country. The
generosity of Bill Williamson
‘52 and president of Blythe
Brothers Properties, Inc.
of Charlotte was also essential
to the financing of the project.

Winston estimated the cost
of the track itself at close to
$30,000. It will be a six-lane
track which will have several
important luxuries. Those
luxuries include permanent
striping, little or no main-
tainence, and fast drying con-
ditions. It will thus be possible
to use the track during the en-

Carolina at Chapel Hill, the
University of South Carolina,
Colorado, Auburn and West
Virginia.

Head track coach Sterling
Martin was very pleased with
the move to build the track
here.

“I think we have waited a
long time for a facility such as
this,”’ he said happily. “I think
it was essential for us to get
such a track to offset some of
the disadvantages we have in
recruiting, since we have no
scholarships.”

Martin indicated pa he
hoped the program
expanded to include some high
school tournaments. This
would also improve the
recruiting for the track squad.

“It is a major step in the ad-
vancement of the track
program here,” Martin ex-
pressed. ‘‘It makes us eligible
to host the conference tour-
nament now and it will also
save the team a tremendous
amount of time which used to
be spent keeping up the old
track.” -
new facility will have include
a runway for long and triple
jump areas and a runway for
the pele vault. There is also
hope that a water jump will be

Mumby, a diver; and Ronald
Owens, swimming butterfly.

Other starters in the coming
meets include Jeff Costelli,

backstroke and free, and Ann
Bode is swimming free.

The coeds will be competing
in the meets whenever the
other teams have female
swimmers competing.

Stevens feels the team is
getting into shape, ‘‘although
it’s hard to stay in shape with
the breaks interrupting prac-
tice schedules."’

The team travels. to
Asheville Dec. 11 for the first
meet of the season.
