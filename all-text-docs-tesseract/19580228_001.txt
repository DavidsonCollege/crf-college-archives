OTTS LECTURE SERIES

Dr. Charles W. Ranson will deliver the Otts Lecture)
Series at Davidson March 16-

Ch

RANSON TO DELIVER

The Otts Lectures were founded at Davidson sixty-
five years ago when the Rev. J. M. P. Otts, D.D., LLD.,
gave Davidson an endowment, the income from which was
to be used to bring outstanding lecturers to the campus.

Dr. Ranson is the son of a
Methodist minister
born in Ireland. He was edu-
cated at the University of Bel-
fast and Oxford University, hold-
ing the Doctor of Philosophy de-
gree from the later.

INDIA MISSIONARY

He was ordained to the
Methodist ministry in 1924, and
served as a parish minister un-
til 1929, when he went to India
as a missionary. He spent near-
ly twenty years there, several
years of that time being spent
as Secretary of the National
Christian Council of India, Bur-
ma, and Ceylon.

In 1947 he was unanimously
elected secre-
tary of the
International
Missionary
Council, with
h eadquarters
in New York
City. He is
widely re
garded as one
of the best-in-
formed per-
sons on Far
Eastern affairs in the Christian
movement. He is the author of
several books, the most recent
being “That the World May
Know.”

He has lectured on endowed
foundations at Drew University,

Dr. Ranson

and the Pacifie School of Re-
ligion.

Dr. Ranson makes his home
with his three children in Lon-
don. :

The lectures, delivered every
two years, are published in book
form. Dr. George Buttrick of
Harvard University delivered
the lectures in 1956.

Long Reports New
From Washington

For several years Davidson has participated in the
Washington Semester Program with The American Uni-

versity in Washington, D.C.

Under this program, it is

possible for as many as three Davidson students each
year to go to Washington for the second semester’s work

at the American University.

This semester, David Long,
‘69, is representing Davidson in
this program. The following are
excerpts from a letter which
Long wrote to the Davidsonian
this week.

“My work includes a thesis
project for three hours credit.
My subject is ‘Nationalism as a
Political Factor in the Middle
East.’

“Since I must have fifteen
hours this semester, I am having
to take three night courses, two
of which are on the Middle
East. ,

THE REAL THING

“Another phase of the pro-
gram includes a seminar course
on government. Rather than
read material from a text, we
see first hand the operation of
the government. .

“At the present time, we are
studying Congress and its func-
tions in the political systems.
This study has included inter-
views with Congressmen, com-
mittee staff men, and personal
relations men.

“A large part of our time is
spent observing Congress in ses-
sion, going to committee meet-
ings, press conferences, and

eating where it says ‘Senators
Only.’ On the whole, my experi-
ences have been enlightening
and at times, highly entertain-
ing—never a dull moment on
Capitol Hill.

A SMALL WORLD

“It is a small world, even in
Washington. Living two blocks
from me is 2nd Lt. John Childs,
Davidson ‘56. Other alumni in-
clude Lt. John McLaughlin, '56,
Nelson Grice, '56, and several
graduates before my time.

“I had dinner with Dr. Hal
Ford recently, who is in the
process of buying a house. He
told me that the wife of the
person who owns the house that
he is trying to buy is a sister-
in-law of Professor MacBrayer.

“Another personnage of im-
portance is one T. Woodrow Wil-
son, deceased, who resides under
a marble slab two block down
the street from me at the Wash-
ington Cathedral. The only one
of importance that I have ‘not
seen is Mr. Eisenhower.

“I hope that I can make this
letter the first of a series which
will give you a briefing on my
semester in Washington—David
Long.”

Bradford Reports
Annual Progress

Dave Bradford, editor of the
Quips and Cranks, has an-
nounced that this year’s annual
will come out earlier in the year
than the 1957 annual.

The first half of the annual

has already been sent to the
printers and engravers, and the
last half is scheduled to be sub-
mitted on March 3.
_ Quips and Cranks will con-
tain more informal snapshots
and campus pictures; also more
space will be dedicated to ath-
letics.

Bradford also stated that this
year’s annual will be larger due
to the innovations and revisions.

uninformed on the process

After conferring with IFC
President Bob Jones, it is my
intention to present here a gen-
eral sketch of the idea together
with a typical hypothetical case.

Jones explained that a pref-
erential bidding system operates
at W&L, Dartmouth, and Prince-
ton, among others, but that the
proposed quota pledging system
limiting the size of the frater-
nities, if effected here, would
be unique at Davidson although
it. is commonly used by sorori-
ties today.

Among the few schools
around the nation which have
quota systems are the Univer-
sity of Arkansas, Washington
and Jefferson, Denison, Univer-
sity of Maine, and University of
New Mexico.

The IFC would control both
bidding and pledging. Each
rushee would list his preferred
fraternities in order, and each
fraternity, in this reciprocal re-
lationship, would list its pre-
ferred rushees. °

However, if the quota of a
fraternity was set at say 16, then
the first 16 or “top boys” it
really wanted are to be listed in
no order of preference, The
rest of the rushees — the
“second, third, ete, string”—
are listed in order.

An impartial and disinterested
group would then determine the
highest correlation between the
two lists. This would involve a
tremendous amount of computa-
tion and an IBM machine is used
at Dartmouth for this purpose.

of the proposed innovation.

Each fraternity would be as-
signed a set quota based on the
size of the fraternity in Septem-
ber before Rush Week. Jones
stated that “60 should be the
limit set for the total number
of members in a given fraterni-
ty and 45 would be ideal.”

By limiting the size of the
pledge class and thus, too, the
total aggregate size, over a
period of say 4 or 5 years, the
fraternity size would become
stabilized.

As a result the big fraterni-
ties would maintain quality
while sacrificing quantity; the
smaller fraternities would build
up to the size of the larger.

Let us consider the case of
Joe Smith, a typical freshman
beleaguered with the usual Rush
Week problems. Joe lists his
choices as 1) Alpha, 2)Lambda,
and 3) Iota, in that order.

Now Alpha's quota, e.g., is 20.
Alpha lists Joe as number 24.
Lambda, Joe’s second choice,
whose quota is, say 18, has him
down as number 27, while Iota,
his third choice, names him in
its first group.

Joe Smith’s Choices:
1, Alpha
2. Lambda
3. Iota
Fraternities’ Lists: Joe Smtih—
Alpha Lambda Tota

Now if Alpha has to go to

Frafernities Launch

Most fraternities have
launched fund raising campaigns.
to take care of furnishing the
new houses on Patterson Court. :

Generally, the estimates for|
furnishing the houses run be-!
tween $10,000 and $15,000. The
variation results from the dif-
ferences in expenses connected ,
with the kitchen equipment.

While several fraternities are
planning to use their present;
equipment, others are having to.
install new kitchen facilities.

The fund raising campaigns
consist of an initial letter sent
to all alumni of the chapter, this!
letter explaining the plans for
furnishing the house. the availa-
ble finances, and the amount
needed by the chapter to com-
plete its plans,

These letters are being signed
by prominent alumni and mem-
bers of the facuity who are
members of the different. frater-
nities.

Folldwing these initial letters,
appeals are sent for donations.
while progress reports are issued!
at certain intervals to let the
alumni know the results of the
campaign.

These campaigns last through
the semester. The new houses
are scheduled to be ready for
occupancy in the fall.

Phi Beta Kappa
Bids Discussed

By PETE

KELLOGG

Davidsonian Feature Writer
Several students have been asking about the system
used in issuing Phi Beta Kappa bids. Here are the answers

There is an obvious discrepancy

between the scholastic ranking
of the senior class as
preted by the Registrar and
published in the Dean’s list and
the ranking used to determine
the recipients of Phi Beta Kap-
pa bids.

The Registrar computes a
weighted average; that is, a stu-
dent making a B on a two-hour
course and on a four-hour course
will receive twice as much
credit for the four-hour course.

The credit given is, then di-
rectly proportional to the grade
and the number of hours. AIl-
though official information is
not available, it is believed that
Phi Beta Kappa recognizes no

| difterence between three and

inter-: four hour coursés.

If this is true, a student tak-
ing four four-hour courses re-
ceives 25% less credit than one
taking five three-hour courses,
although he is carrying the
heavier load.

Phi Beta Kappa is an hon-
orary fraternity whose member-
ship. is by invitation, and
scholastic achievement is not the
only membership requirement.

_ Nevertheless, would not a
clarification of the discrep-
ancies between the public

scholastic ranking and the Phi
Beta Kappa rating promote
greater understanding?
