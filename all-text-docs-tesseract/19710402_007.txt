If the weather improves,
Davidson could haye one of
its best tennis seasons in re-
cent years, according to
head coach Harry Fogleman.

‘‘We have had two matches
postponed due to snow,"’ Fo-
glemen said, ‘‘but, more im-
portantly, we have lost much
valuable practice time.’

In their first match after

the weather became favor-
able, the netters blanked
MIT 9-0.

Fogleman said that the
lineup for this year has final
ly been. set.

The team is young, includ-

ing only two seniors, but Fo-
gleman felt he could call it
‘fone of the best in the_coun-
try.”’

The two seniors are Jim
Cantrell and Jeff Chetwood.
Backing them up are. four
sophomores, Jéff Dumansky,
Bobby Koury, David Weav-
er and Hy Lankenau. The
sole freshman on the team is
Bill Allen.

Fogleman said he was
pleased with the way the
team has looked so far, and
that they havé been working

harder and playing better in
the last weeks,

He especially cited Cantrell
as making great improve-
ment.

The team has posted a 6-1
record, before the match yes-

terday with Wake Forest,
their only loss coming to
Rollins.

Today the team will com
pete at Furman, and then
move to Emory for’a match
tomorrow. -

xt week the team will
host four matches, beginning
with the University of Indi
ana,

Tuesday the netters will
meet Hope .College, and on
Thursday they will host In-
diana State University.

Yesterday Dr. Tom Scott,
director of athletics, met
with Bevan and C. David
Cornell, vice-president of fi
nancial affairs, to discuss the
proposed budget.

“We will see the proposals
they give us, and then see if
our budget to the
amount,’ Scott said. “If we
then we will offer a
counter proposal for them to
consider.’ k

Colonel F. B. Outlaw, di
rector of athletic finances,
stressed that this was not an
across the board cut for all

athletics,

law emphasized that any part
of the program would be
subject to a budget cut.
