University of Maryland Assistant
Coach Dave Prichett has accepted the
position of Head Basketball Coach at
Davidson College.

His acceptance followed . immedi-
ately upon the resignation of Dart-
mouth Head Basketball Coach Gary
Walters Monday.

Walters resigned his position at
Davidson and returned to Dartmouth
after a consideration of the jobsHe
said that he was “‘just an Ivy League
kid at heart and felt uncomfortable in
the big time.’’

Walters has said earlier that the
Davidson position ‘‘was too chal-

lenging to refuse.’’ He admitted that
he was probably committing ‘‘pro-

fessional suicide’ by resigning, but

felt that his decision was correct.

Prichett, originally Davidson's se-
cond choice in its search for a
basketball coach after the firing of Bo
Brickels, was given a four year
contract and a salary estimated at
close to $30,000. He was on the job
within 12 hours of being hired.

Prichett is optimistic about his
position at Davidson. ‘‘I am con-
vinced that if the students, faculty
and the community want a class
program then we can get the job done
at Davidson,” he said.

“I think Davidson has enough

tradition and academic image that it
can be a situation the faculty,
students, and community can be
proud of in a national sense,’’ he
continued.

Director of Athletics Thomas A.
Cartmill was also optimistic about
Prichett’s acceptance. ‘‘I am de-
lighted that Dave has decided to
become our new basketball coach,”’
said Cartmill. ‘‘He is one of the finest
young recruiters in the country today.

“I feel he is the one man who can
salvage the recruiting year and put us
back in business by next year,’’ he

continued.
Prichett was an assistant coach to

Lefty Driesell at Maryland for three

years where he built a reputation as
an excellent recruiter. Driesell said
that Prichett is ‘‘an excellent coach in
all areas, not just a recruiter.”

“He is young and ambitious,’’ said
Driesell, ‘‘and I hate to lose him. I
think he will do an excellent job at
Davidson.

Davidson basketball players said

. that they were pleased with Prichett’s

hiring and feel he is competent
enough to run a good program.
Prichett’s basketball experience in-
cludes assistant coaching positions at
Boston College for two years, posi-
tions as assistant and freshman coach
at Bluefield State, West Virginia for
one year, and freshman coach for two

space for boys and girls

Students march to veto calendar,
Spencer sympathetic, helpless

By BRAD SWALWELL
Senior News Editor

A crowd of approximately
‘300 students gathered next to
the house of College President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. last
Tuesday in support of a Stu-
dent Government Association
(S.G.A.) petition to change
the academic calendar for the
1976-77 school year.

The crowd witnessed
S.G.A. President Bo Baskin’s
presentation of the petition,
which was signed by about 800
people, to Spencer.

The petition asked the Fac-
ulty Executive Committee
(FEC) to change next year’s
calendar by reinstating the
study day for next Fall’s
exams and by delaying the
return from Christmas recess
from Monday, January 3 to
Tuesday, January 4 in the
interest of student return-
travel convienience.

Before presenting the peti-
tion to Spencer, Baskin com-

mented on the purpose of the
petition and the gathering.
“‘We’re presenting this peti-
tion to Dr. Spencer so that he

‘ can in turn’ present it to the

Faculty Executive Commit-
tee.

“He (Spencer) only votes on
the committee in case of a tie.
He’s not the one to convince.
This is not directed, at Dr.
Spencer, but at the Faculty
Executive Committee,” said
Baskin.

Besides Spencer, the mem-
bers of the FEC are: Profes-
sors Burnett, D. Grant, Hol-
land, Kelton, Nelson, and
Winkler; Academic Vice Pres-
ident Johnston; and Dean of
Students Terry.

Baskin outlined previous
efforts of the Senate to change
the calendar. ‘‘We’ve visited
with individual members of
the Committee. We met with

the full committee twice. .
We've presented them with .,

two unanimous resolutions--
this makes our third.
'“T think it would be good if

all the students would go by
and see the members of the
committee. Tell them how you
feel,’”’ he said.

Baskin expressed disap-
pointment in the decisions to
date of the FEC. “I think it’s
unfortunate that an academic
calendar should cause such a
hassle. This has been an
inordinately big hassle about

an issue which students

should have some say.

‘‘We (the Senate) have
taken a very accomodating
attitude. I really hope some-
thing can be worked out,” said
Baskin.

In accepting the petition,
Spencer reiterated Baskin’s
comment that the decision was
not his (Spencer’s) to make,
saying, ‘‘What Bo has said
about procedure is accurate.
It’s in the hands of the
Faculty Executive Commit
tee.”

Spencer said that, had he

voted, he would have voted
against the proposal to cancel
classes on Good Friday,

against the proposal to delay
opening until January 4, and
for the proposal to reinstate
the Fall study day.

‘I think the study day is
important and I will tell the
faculty that,”” said Spencer.

(In an earlier proposal to the
FEC, the Senate had asked
the cancellation of class on
Good Friday. This request
was not included in the peti-
tion presented to Spencer.)
Spencer added that the FEC
had expressed a desire to
begin work on the academic
calendars for the next few

Williams.

The completion of Carnegie
Guest House and transforma-
tion of Chambers Banquet
Hall into an art gallery are
among upcoming plans for
structural improvements.

Emphasis on ‘‘perimeter
housing’’ to meet increased
student housing demands and
a piecemeal renovation of
existing forms also figures in-
to the improvement picture.

‘‘We are approaching an
enrollment of 1300 students,”
said Williams. After consid-
ering economic factors and
Davidson’s continuing
commitment to high-quality
education, the Trustees. have
decided to stabilize enrollment |
at 1300 for the foreseeable
future.

“Expansion plans are being
made with the number 1500 in
mind as a long-term goal,” he

“The Martin Science
Building needs considerable
improvement to bring it up to
the standards of other teach-
ing facilities at Davidson,”
continued Williams.

“Most of the interior features
are old and outdated, but the
building itself is structurally
sound and its exterior is
compatible with other campus
buildings, he said.

“*A complete renovation,
including use of the attic
would make available 25,000
square feet of space, adequate
for a student body of 1500,”
said Williams.

“The Chemistry department
has been waiting for years for
an improvement, and they
have presented plans for the
project. Funds are now being
actively pursued to renovate
Martin at a cost of $780,000.

‘‘This summer we hope to
remodel Chambers Banquet
Hall into a multi-purpose art

gallery with these needs in
