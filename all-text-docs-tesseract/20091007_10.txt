10 THE DavipsoniAN

The men’s cross country team won its
first two meets of the year, the Eye Opener
and the Winthrop Invitational in demanding
fashion. They knew that Saturday’s meet in
Louisville, Kentucky was against the best
teams in the country, and they would have
to run their best in order to come out on top
again. Well, according to Coach Andrew,
“This was one of the best performances ever
for Davidson men’s cross country.”

The Wildcats finished an impressive
sixth out of 38 teams. The top-5 team finish-
ers were University of Louisville (68 points),
University of Kentucky (158 points), Uni-
versity of Tennessee (188 points), Central
Michigan University (205 points), and Mid-
die Tennessee State University (251 points).
The Wildcats finished with 258 total points.

Leading the Wildcats was Lance Harden
”10 with a Davidson-best time in an 8000-me-
ter race. He finished in 25th place with a
time of 24:43. Behind Harden was Ryan
Hopkins °12, finishing in 31st place overall
with a time of 24:49. Other Wildcats finish-
ers included: Tom Divinnie ’10 (44th/25:05),
Thad Sieracki ’10 (86th/25:38), Ian Tupper
°12 (95th/25:43), Peter Bruton °10 (25:49)
and Charlie Schmitt ’11 (26:19).

the box. Their approach succeeded in its pri-
mary objective—the Spartans could not pen-
etrate the back line. Nevertheless, one of the
visitors let a shot fly from 30 feet. It soared
straight into the upper-90, top right shelf.
What the ’Cats did after allowing that
goal represents the full extent of their growth
this season. Prone to letting by points in
quick succession, the players implemented
their next-five, best-five strategy — after a

lege finished in first place overall with a time
of 23:33. Rounding out the top-5 individuals
were Carison Kemei ’13 of McKendree Col-
lege (2nd/23:47), Barnabas Kirui ’11 of Ole
Miss University (3rd/23:52), Mike Crouch
"11 of . University of Charlotte-Queens
(4th/23:55), and Matt Bruce from University
of Louisville with a time of 24:02.

The men’s team will hope to continue
their great season when they head to Boone,
N.C. for the Blue Ridge Mountain Open on
October 16, 2009. Additionally, the Wildcats
moved up to 13th in the Southeast rankings.

The women’s cross country team finished
runner-up in its first two meets of the year,
the Eye Opener and the Winthrop Invitation-
al. Just as it was for the men, Saturday’s meet
in Louisville, Kentucky was against the best
teams in the country, and they would have
to run their best in order to finish well. They
did just that.

The Wildcats finished in 11th place out of
38 teams, which, in such a talented field, is a
job well done. The top-5 team finishers were
Purdue University (88 points), University of
Kentucky (130 points), University of Lou-
isville (141 points), University of Missouri
(173 points) and Western Kentucky Univer-
sity (173 points).

The Wildcats finished with 360 total
points. Leading the Wildcats was Natalie

Atabek ’13 with a time of 18:32. She finished
in 48th place. Behind Atabek was a trio of
juniors. Lauren Childs °11, finished in 61st
place overall with a time of 18:43, Danielle
Ruggieri *11 finished in 65th place with a
time of 18:46, and Heather Connaroe ’11 fin-
ished in 69th place with a time of 18:47. The
final runner for the Wildcats was Jane Gay
12, who came in 121st after running the 5k
in 19:21.

Coach Straub was very please with her
team’s effort, as she noted, “At a very com-
petitive meet, our goal was to finish in the top
11 and thanks to smart running, we were able
to do that! We are a very young team, but
I am very pleased with our progress to this
point. We are definitely moving in the right
direction and running well right now.”

Janet Jesang °10 of Western Kentucky
University finished in first place overall with
a time of 16:47. Rounding out the top-5 in-
dividuals were: Tarah McKay °10 of Univer-
sity of Louisville (2nd/17:02), Justyna Mudy
"12 of Shorter College (3rd/17:09), Marion
Kandy °12 of Western Kentucky University
(4th/17:21), and Camille Buscomb °13 from
Purdue University with a time of 17:23.

The women’s cross country team will
hope to continue their great season when
they head to Spartanburg, S.C. for the USC
Upstate Invitational on October 17, 2009.

scoreboard setback, don’t lose heart.

The tenacity reverberated throughout
Alumni Stadium as Davidson turned on the
jets in those critical moments, racing down-
field to set up shots for Allison Drutchas ’11
and Callan Elswick ’11. As the 80th minute
approached, the ’Cats forced a desperate
Spartan D into two comer kick situations.

The second one reversed three years of
Greensboro supremacy in the Southern Con-
ference. Drutchas nailed a deep ball into the
far side of the box, gathered up by Lauren
Conner ’10 who lobbed a shot on goal. In the
chaos that ensued, Kyri Bye-Nagel ’ 10 head-
ed the deflected rebound toward her fellow
senior who scored the game-winning goal.

With 10 minutes left, the Davidson de-
fense had learned from its earlier mistakes.
It adopted a new approach to lock up the
Spartan attack — the best defense is a good
offense. Capitalizing on the go-ahead goal
momentum, the ’Cats repeated their strikes
on goal. They nearly put the game away for
good on several occasions.

But the effort would work well enough.
Jessie Baxa °12 cleaned up her opposition’s
late-game desperation offense, totaling five
saves on the evening. A pair of deep David-
son clears in the final moments put the game
out of the Spartans’ reach, overthrowing their
unbeaten conference rule.

After the wild Friday night affair, Sunday
was all business. Elon waltzed into Alumni
Stadium, bouncing off a five-game win streak
and the best start of any SoCon team. Their
light step was disrupted by a determined Da-
vidson squad.

The ’Cats played with a particular ur-
gency to earn another W. Before the crowd
had time to settle, Blakely Low ’10 ripped a
smooth assist from Suzanne Sittko ’10 into
the top corner of the net.

The offense kept up its intensity after its
first goal, with Bye-Nagel and Amanda Flink
*11 each directing shots toward the shaken
Elon defense. It was only a matter of time
before the Phoenix made a mistake.

Just before the 12th minute, the visiting
squad lost control of a ball on the right side
of the box. A streaking Bye-Nagel refused
to let the opportunity slip, and she snuck the
ball into the back of the net from the six-yard
line.

After the blinding rush of two scores ear-
ly in the game, Elon could not recover. Up
by their highest margin in weeks, the ’Cats
settled into a lockdown defense, allowing
10 shots all game and only two on goal. In
her first shutout of the year, Baxa snuffed out
both opportunities.

Over the course of the weekend, the
Wildcats revealed their top-down approach
to shaking up the SoCon standings. By dis-
mantling the top two teams on the charts,
they ignited a scramble for the precious four
spots in the conference tournament. With
three weeks to go, it’s a free-for-all down
South, and Davidson has just entered the race
as a top competitor.

Thursday, they conclude their home
stretch against College of Charleston, which
boats a 3-1 conference record. Over the
weekend, the ’Cats have a match in Charles-
ton against The Citadel on Sunday, Oct. 11.
