“VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR BULLIES.

"Ar this season of the year the Sopho-
mores are taking great ‘interest in’ a
course not mentioned in the catalogue
but given with the tacit approval of the
faculty, that is, field work in petty ty-
ranny. They the authorized to in-
dulge in one of the most pernicious of
human instincts, the abuse of power and
the gratuitous interference with the
rights of others. ‘The student daily of
the largest university of the world puts
the common belief with brutal frank
ness:

“That there should be a certain
amount of animosity between the two
lower classes is not alone natural, it is
also desirable. ‘Phe old adage — that
everybody loves a fight holds on the
campus as it does elsewhere.”

That “everybody loves a fight” is a
genial explanation of the state of Eu-
rope and it is undeniably “natural” to
delight in the annoyance of inferiors,
but the campus does not seem a suitable
place for the deliberate cultivation of
primeval viciousness. Recent — regula-
tions have done away with the grosser
forms of hazing but have left the moral
evil of it untouched. Saving the fresh-
men from the torture and danger of the
old customs is doubtless desirable, but
the net gain is slight, since the milder
forms of tyranny meet with more gen-
eral toleration and inflict more lasting
injury upon the characters of those who
impose them and those who sumbit to
them. To tie a man to a railroad track,
to bury him alive or brand him with
silver nitrate are not pastimes in which
one is apt to find delight after his sopho-
more days, but the habit of. imposing
one’s will upon others in the matter of
dress and conduct is not so easily out-
lived. A man who has been allowed to
dictate to younger and less educated men
what color neckties and socks they shall
wear, what they shall sing and where
they shall walk, is apt to carry into later
life the belief in class destruction and
intolerance which his college training
has given him.—N. Y. Independent.

IN THE LIBRARY.

For the benefit of inexperienced de-|C. A

baters, a small collection of books about
debating is placed in the Reference
Room, to be used as reference books.
These can be studied to advantage even
by others than first-year men.
