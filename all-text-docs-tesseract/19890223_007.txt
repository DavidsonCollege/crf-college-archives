APEGOAT FoR THE

TAPIA, from page 5

and I said yes. After preaching
there, I decided that I would like
to become a pastor rather than
return to counseling.

The church asked me back for
sixteen Sundays. At this point, my
father told me that-I had a good
chance to become pastor of the
church, but that I needed a part-
time job in the meantime. With
my father’s encouragement, I put
in an application for a job here at
the college.

Having grown up in Davidson,1 .

had seen blacks employed at the
college only in domestic-type
jobs, so I didn’t really expect that

I would be hired. And I didn’t
really want the job because of the
small-town atmosphere; I had
seen the world and I liked it better
than Davidson, To say the least, I
was surprised when I got the job.

I took it because I felt that it was.

God’s will and I was committed to
do His will.

The job gave me the opportu-
nity to do something I had vowed
to do as a child. As a child the
major intellectual stimulation I
felt came from Davidson, its pro-
gtams and faculty. Ever since

then I wanted to give to Davidson -

some of what it gave to me,

UP

after so many years?

A. Growing up was not easy,
because Davidson is asmall town.
I always felt that the railroad
tracks were a wall. Coming back
was quite a shock because in At-
lanta many of my friends were
white and we never thought of
each other as being black or
white--we were just friends. I had
“forgotten” what it meant to be
black in Davidson.

Q. Has being black or being a
woman hindered you in any way?
A. No--I have always been my
own worstenemy. I define myself
from the inside out, rather than
from the outside in, so I need only
to depend on my own feelings and

ideas concerning myself. instead
of on what others think. I never
gave society enough credit or
power to let it define my being,
and I always felt that whatever I
received would be by God’s will.

Q. How do you feel about the way
the college is celebrating Black
History Month?

A. I would prefer that the college
be more inclusive of black history
and culture. We do not celebrate

White History Month. The col-

lege needs to integrate black his-
tory and culture with white his-
tory instead of celebrating it once
a year.

Q. What are your goals for the

future?
A. I don’t really have any long-
term goals because I prefer to set
goals according to where I am at
the moment. I do hope that before
-Tleave Davidson I will see a Vice-
President of Minority Affairs es-
tablished.

I feel that Davidson can. be a
better college because I see it as it
can be and:as God wants it to be.
Right now, it is better than most
other schools because it will not
enroll black students just because
of their race and because it will
not lower its standards fos any
reason, I hope for a time when the
campus will have a racial and
cultural diversity that is natural
and without prejudice.
