“War educates the senses, calls intu
action the will, perfects the physical con-
dition, brings men into such swift and
close collision in critical moments that
man measures man,"—LEmerson.

Recently in this column we spoke of
the introduction of the Rifle Club. Ua-
der the then existing conditions we are
still of the same opinion. Under those:
same conditions we would not retract,
but since Congress has declared = war
against Germany, we are going to sup-
port this action as hard as cannon bally
even tho it contradict everything that has
been said.

As yet no action has been taken by the
student body as a unit in this regard.
But the general concensus of opinion is

that we are going when needed.  Prob-
ably some will go at first call. Others
will follow later if they are needed.
Some will go to mobilization — camps.

others to chemical laboratories or to
olaces where their genius bids fair to
vender the best service to their country.

On account of the absence of Pres-
ident Martin the faculty has not given
its expression as to what policy will be
followed. But this is expected soon.

Davidson men are voicing the same
spirit of democracy and injustice as the
whole world is doing. We are going to
fight for the maintenance of our na-
tional honor and integrity. The princi-
ples which are sacred to man and God
will be upheld and fought for by the
“Red and Black spirit as long as those
principles exist. Davidson stands for
championing the right.

THE SPIRIT.

“Yes, boys, that is a bad mud hole
(just north of town) and it ought to be
fixed. The Mecklenburg line goes be-
yond that sign and there the Iredell linc
hegins. Neither will fix it, and some of
them will have to pay for tt some day!"

These were the words frankly spoken
by a farmer, sixty years old, who resides
near here. ‘This conversation took place
on the highway to Statesville last “Mhurs-
day. The man was lame. tanned, and
the white beard was growing out some-
what on account of the neglect for sev-
eral days. He had an air pf thoro seri-
ousness and intense carnestpass.

“Boys, | have been down to Davidson
to find out the war news. T hear that

—}about the war.

vongiess is going to declare war, and .
un skeered. Yes. “here are two boy.
at home—one is twenty-two, the oth.
will soon be twenty. “Lhey are delicau
oys. | fost three older boys wit
.uberkulosis. My wife is worried abou
hem too.”

“PU tell you! Germany wants to ge
he Newnited States into this scrap. We
sre always good to our prisoners. W
ave never inistreated them. Germany
-nows that if she surrenders to Anglane
wt France that she will be blotted off the
zarth. Germany wants lo surrender te
.8 because we will treat them square.”

Have you ever heard this staced in thi.
way before? “Uhis stands in the face oi
‘eason. «It is a good philosophy.

“L have never forgotten the other war.

“or first two years we lived pretty goou
—my father left plenty to eat. But 1h
ell you the truth, in the last two we like
o starved. I have walked with my
sammy every two weeks from a littic
crossing just above here to Statesville
or half gallon of salt. And then maybe
ve would not pit it ontil next draw day.
_ had rather gu to war than for my boys.
if they kill me they will cheat me out of
a few years. When I was in town awhile
ago | saw those students lined up and |
hought then that they would soun be in
another kind of line.”

‘Then we talked about some members’
of the faculty and what they thought
He, in his way, spoke in
most complimentary terms of — thuse
whom he knew. But he could not keep
from talking about war.

“Ul tell: you, boys! We are going
to win this war. God is on our side.
Amerique has never lost a battle, and
we are going to win this.”

Midnight raids by acroplanes over this
country were discussed. ‘Then as to the
probable damage that would be done to
our munition plants. He exprest his
contempt for the Germans trying to
raise a riot among the colored — race.
“When they do 1 will shed the last drop
of my blood. And those old Mexi-
kans—they are liable to give us trouble.
But we are going to win.”

A swift little breeze blew a treacher-
ous cloud above the horizon. After tell-
ng him how much we enjoyed having
ialked with him—we departed, no.
snowing his name. ‘hese few moments
were impressive for two college boys
Impressive in many ways.  Altho he
rarely spoke a sentence correctly, yet he
had some good ideas about the war anu
he had the spirit of Americanism. As:
a ten-year-old boy he had so suffered
hunger and had realized the awful ex
periences of war that he was able to give
us a more vivid picture of what wa
really is. ‘This shows the spirit—the
paternal care—would take the place of
his boys; it shows the absorbing interest
that this war is commanding; it shows
the true genuine spirit in which we
should face the enemy's fire, the we
know the horrors, we should die for our
country if needs be. Then, too, he had
solved the situation—we would win—
we had been kind to our prisoners of war
and Germany wanted to surrender to us
—Gad is on our side.

REPORTERS’ STAFF
TO BE FORMED

At a recent meeting of THe Davin-
SONIAN Staff a new plan of competition
was adopted for the reporter's staff which
was as follows: Every man who de-
sires to compote for the reporter's staff
must hand his name to the Assignment
Editor, who will send to him each week
at least one or more assignments. These
assignments will be turned into the dif-
ferent members of THe Davinsonian
Staff. who will correct and grade the
assignments and then turn them over to
the Managing Editor, who shall keep a
record of each man’s work. From the
number handing in their names, ten men

id you « you ever stop to think

D of the direct advantages to be gained from
printing that will catch the eye and hold it long@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
ing sameness—a tendency to cause a ‘“‘look-
arourd-more” disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little different, if not entirely
distinctive, when compired with the current station-
ery that reaches his office.

We invite a careful and studied analysis of the
samples we always keepon hand for your inspection.
It isthe aim and purpose of each unit that gocs to
make up the Presbyterian Standard Publishing Co.
to lend every effort possible to satisfy a customer

absolutely. A thorough test will furnish anv proof desired.
