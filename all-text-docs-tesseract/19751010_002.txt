Long to complete ’75 annual,

By STEVE BELL
Staff Writer

At the request of Randy
Hunter, current editor of the
Quips and Cranks, the SGA
Senate has officially appointed
Zach Long to co-ordinate the
1974-1975 yearbook that Car-
roll Ensley has left uncom-
pleted.

Ensley’s term as editor for
the 1974-1975 yearbook ended

with the end of the school
year. Technically, this left
Randy Hunter with the re-
sponsibility for finishing last
year’s yearbook as well as for
this year’s.

Long has volunteered to
finish Ensley’s yearbook, and
the Senate agreed without
dissent to Long’s appointment
as ‘‘coordinator’’.

task of finding out information
on the hiring and evaluative
policies in the school system,”
continued Wood.

The three weeks in Atlanta
were spent primarily in inter-
viewing Atlanta Board of Ed-
ucation members, school prin-

tem this past summer.

The Plunge group- con-
ducted an intensive three week
study of teacher evaluation in
the Atlanta public schools.

The proposal for the project
originated in the Office for
Experiential Programs and
was coordinated by its Direc-
tor Ken Wood. 7

A grant from the Institute /
for Undergraudate Reform in  *
North Carolina provided most |
of the funds for the project,
with additional assistance pro-
vided by the Office for Experi-
ential Programs.

With this money, students
were provided with lodging
and given an allowance for
travel and food. Dr. Ruth also ;
received a stipend for his |
participation.

cipals, PTA presidents, and

administrative officials, as
well as talking with the com-
munity groups to insure a
wide perspective of views.

“The Atlanta school board
is unique in that it has a
perfect racial and sexual ba-
lance. Of the ten members,
five are women and five are
black,” remarked participant
Rob Harshman.

“The first week was the
hardest,”” commented partici-
pant Dana English, “because
nobody had a clear idea as to
what we were doing or how to
limit the topic.

“That week we interviewed

‘nine of the ten Board of

Education members and
waited for a letter of introduc-
tion from the associate super-
intendent of the school system
before beginning interviews
with the 22 principals and
corresponding PTA presi-
dents,’’ stated English.

“The same interview ques-
tions and questionnaires were
given to all principals and
PTA presidents to facilitate in

heard a proposed revision of
the SGA By-Laws: the propo-
sal is to have a yearbook
editor’s term extended until
the book is actually published.
According to Senate proce-
dure, the vote on this amend-
ment will have to wait until

next week’s meeting.

In further business Tuesday
night, the Senate rescinded
$10 parking fines and restored
the $5 fine. John Guthrie

proposed that the $10 fines be
repealed, arguing that they
were not serving their pur-
pose.

The Senate approved the
$10 fines less than a month
ago as a measure to discourage
the increasing number of park-
ing violations.

However, Alan Malcolm,
chief of the parking patrol,
explained that the $10 fine has
not decreased the number of
parking violations.

Lynn Keener moved to table
Guthrie’s motion so that Ed
Willingham, chairman of the
Parking Committee,” and
others could be invited to
discuss the proposal. In the
first close Senate vote of the
year, Keener’s motion to table
failed 8-9.

Marc Menchel proposed
that any repeal of the $10 fine
be made retroactive; his
amendment passed 15-3. How-
ever, the procedure for previ-
ous parking violators to reco-
ver $5 from their fines has not
yet been established.

Finally, the motion to repeal
the $10 fines passed 9-7, with
2 abstentions.

...Wood suggests using right brain

(Continued from page 1)

“T hope that this institution can
move in the direction of incorporating
problem-solving experience into the
curriculum which would enable the
students to enter into informed and
sincere discussion in and out of the
classroom.

Left side of the brain

‘“‘We know the left side of the brain
is used for cognitive activity, whereas
the intuitive part of the brain is the
right half. Davidson is so one-sidedly
cognitive that we must be wasting at
least half of our potential.”’

About 70 percent of Davidson
students go on to graduate school but
Wood said, ‘You probably don’t need
to stay in school as long as you think
you do. Staying in school may bring
prestige but is not necessarily of
practical value in terms of being able
to function as a steward in the
world.”

“Study after sociological study has
shown that there is no correlation
between grades and success in a
chosen occupation,’” Wood remarked;
“nor do I suspect a correlation exists
between years of higher education and
achievement of a_ satisfying life.
Competence is important, but there
may be better ways of acquiring
competence than spending years in
graduate school.”

The Life/Work Planning Work-
shops for this year which Wood put
together over the summer are desig-
ned to answer three questions:

1. What is my uniqueness? (skills,
interests, personality traits, values)

2. Where do I want to apply my
unigeness? (geographically, in terms
of which organizations, causes, people
that I want to be around)

3. How can I find the place that will
enable me to actualize my potential?

To answer the first question, each
student lists the ten achievements
which he would rank above all others
in his life. Other participants in the
workshop help him to factor the
achievements for specific skills and
traits.

Personality Tests

The Strong-Campbell Vocational
Inventory Test and the Myers-Briggs
Personality Type Test are adminis-
tered, and there are group exercises to
get at a definition of values.

The workshop attempts to clarifies
questions two and three by taking a
day and going into Charlotte, called a
practise field survey. The students
use business firms, telephone books,
and even newspapers to identify
people in Charlotte who have similar
interests. Then they contact the
people, preferably by going to them in
person.

This straightforward approach

sounds outrageous, but Wood did it
this summer in a strange city, with
astounding results.

According to Wood, the people he
selected could not wait to speak with
him at length about a shared interest;
they cancelled previous engagements

so as not to miss the opportunity to |

discuss something which was impor-
tant to them with someone who
understood.

Analyze a community

In this manner students learn
about additional skills they might
need to develop and off-campus
experience that might be helpful.
They gather information about places
to live, people who could help them,
and how to analyze a community to
decide where they might fit in.

Three Life /Work Planning work-
shops for seniors, juniors, and sop-
homores are already in progress,
meeting either for two hours at a time
in six sessions or in four-hour sessions
on each of three weekends. More of
the same are planned for winter and
spring terms, but places are filling
quickly, and anyone interested should
sign up in the near future, according
to Wood.

He emphasized that the workshops
are designed not just for people who
cannot decide on an occupational field
or who are looking for a job. Each
student, even if he has already

decided upon a life/work plan for
himself, will be able to come up with
one or two altenatives by the end of
the workshop, Wood claims.

What is the point of developing an
original life/work plan if there is no
demand for it on the job market?
Wood would reply that students do
not have to. rely on. traditional
understanding of the job market; that
is an excuse which keeps them from
exercising their rights and responsi-
bilities.

He believes from his own exper-
ience that if a person knows what he
or she has to offer and can locate
places or firms where a plan might
work, soliciting for a job is not a
humiliating business.

Making contacts

Wood explained, ‘‘You make con-
tacts, tell them what you can do for
them, and interview them to see if
they can offer you a position which
would facilitate your self-shaping.

“Organizations do not want to hire
people who come begging for any old
job. They are looking for people with
initiative, who will have a zest for
their job and thus will perform well.”’
Wood's methods rely on contacts with
individuals in various walks of life
who could perhaps help, but
““success’’ according to Wood, de-
pends ultimately on the resourceful-
ness of the student.
