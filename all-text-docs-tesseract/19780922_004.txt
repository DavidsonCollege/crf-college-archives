mic Vice President Price Zim-
mermann’s Code of Faculty
Evaluation, as revised with
Professional Affairs Commit-
tee, follows.

1. PREAMBLE

The goel of Davidson's ap-
pointment and evaluation. pro-
cedures is to recruit and retain
for the faculty outstanding men
and women who will carry on
the College’s mission as set
down in the Statement of
Purpose. Article IV, Section 5
of the Trustees’ By-Laws sets
forth the President’s basic
charge with respect to the re-
cruitment of faculty members.

The qualities of the ideal tea-
cher are easy to delineate,
difficult to realize. The exem-
plary college professor would no
doubt be a scholar widely res-
pected by his or her peers in the
field, who is not only excited
about the prospect of learning
and discovery but capable of
communicating this excitement
to others, a teacher deeply con-
cerned with the welfare of
students and eager to have
them learn and grow, one who
succeeds in capturing their irna-
gination, who teaches not only
by books but by personal
example, who is demanding yet
compassionate, always
maintaining a sense of just pro-
portion and ever respectful of
the moral worth of individual
students and their potential for
intellectual and_ spiritual
growth.

_No one teacher is likely to
realize all of these attributes in
the highest degree, but the
College must continually seek
to recruit men and women.who
strive to do so to the greatest
extent possible, Moreover, a
church-related college which is
faithful to its heritage has the
obligation of securing for its fa-
culty teachers and scholars
who, above and beyond their
professional commitments, -are
sensitive to needs and problems
which transcend local, regional
and national boundaries, who
uphold the highest ethical ideals
and whose motive is service.

Because of the foregoing con-
siderations, Davidson's evalua-
tions concerning persons for ite
faculty cannot be bound exclu-
sively by standards employed
elsewhere in the profession, nor.

holistic nature. Successful
teaching involves to a great
extent the personal and moral
qualities as well as the intellec-
tual capabilities of the teacher,
making it difficult to establish
rigidly precise standards of
excellence. Within any group
even of highly successful tea-

approaches

styles of teaching--all of which,
- from the -standpoint of the
experience of the students, is
highly desirable. Indeed, not
every student finds the esme
teacher exciting or stimulating.

Hence, as with any process
involving human interaction, it
is inevitable and necessary that
judgements at Davidson will

contain a subjective element.
What is important is that
judgements at all stages in the
Process be made as conscien-
tiously and as fairly as possible
both to the individual and to the
institution, and that the per-
spective taken be the welfare of
the entire community and the
achievement of its goals.

Procedurally, the means by
which. the College arrives at its
judgements must be clear
enough to be fair, yet flexible
enough to accommodate indivi-
dual circumstances and to se-
cure for the College the various
strengths which it requires.
For the protection of both the
individual and the community,
the procedures must entail.
strict confidentiality. They
must include evidence obtained
from department chairmen, col-
leagues and students.

They must also reflect the
fact that ultimately college
policy is defined by the Trus-
tees, and that, as the chief
executive officer, the President
bears a special responsibility for
the welfare of the enterprise as a
whole. The Board of Trustees
has affirmed that ‘the line of
responsibility for determination
of faculty needs and the search
for persons to fill these needs
flows from the Trustees to the
President and through him to
those specifically designated by
him, primarily the Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs.”

However, if Davidson is to
accomplish its mission in higher
education, the difficult and
sometimes painful task of up-
holding high standards in the
recruitment and evaluation of
faculty members must be con-
scientiously accepted and
shared by everyone participa-
ting in the review process.

Finally, Davidson's faculty
evaluation procedures must be
closely related to institutional
strategies for faculty develop-
ment. The academic profession
is a demanding one.

Good teaching requires con-——
tinual study and work to keep
up with general developments
in one’s field as well as advances
in one’s specialty. In a liberal
arts context, still further rea-
ding is required to achieve that
understanding of related fields
which makes possible conversa-
tion with colleagues and which
assists students in integrating
the various aspects of their
intellectual experience at the

College by providing living .
models of wide learning.

_ Students are quick to per-
ceive which of their instructors
are active professionals, which
merely living on past capital.
The College must see that
evaluation and opportunities for
development are linked in such
a fashion as to nurture and
reward the professional growth
of those upon whom the tea-
ching mission of the College is
ultimately depeniient.

While it must inevitable func-
tion in some aspects as a
mechanism for selection, none-
theless the overall sim of
Davidson's evaluation process
is to strengthen skills in
teaching capsvities. Evaluation
procedures function best when
their operation is seen as a

means of improving individual
performance, and hence the
general sense of faculty profes-
sionalism, student satisfaction,
and institutional morale.
It. CRITERIA FOR FACUL-
TY EVALUATION _
The three criteria for faculty
evaluation at Davidson are (1)
excellence in teaching, (2) de-

,monstration of superior profes-

sional attainments in research,
scholarship, and curriculum de-
sign, and (3) exemplification of
the intellectual and moral
values for which the College
stands, as manifested in con-
cern for students and service to
both the institution and the
wider community. ;
Given the need to consider

individual strengths from the
standpoint of the College’s .

overall priorities, no precise
weights valid for every case can
be attached to each of these
three areas. However, excel-
lence in teaching is a necessary
condition of consideration for
tenure.

In regard to.the first criterion
--excellence in teaching -- evi-
dence will be sought from the
department chairman,
colleagues in the department
and in other programs in which
the candidate has been: in-

volved, and from students as to_

the instructor's ability to com-
municate not only knowledge
but enthusiasm for the subject.

Also important are quality of
imagination in perceiving the
problems students encounter
and skill in helping overcome
them. Well organized and sti-
mulating lectures, skill in con-
ducting discussions, and suc-
cess in helping students learn to
think analytically and express
themselves cogently, both oral-
ly and in writing, are among the
key components of successful
teaching. It should be borne in
mind that the College is seeking
distinctipn in teaching, not
simply adequate or generally
competent performance.

With regard to the second

2. Students

In most instances students
are not in a position to assess
professional competence but
they are in a position to
comment on the instructor's
enthusiasm, his or her concern
for them, and whether or not
they feel he or she has helped
them in understanding the sub-
ject matter. They can testify to
the instructor’s availability,
fairness, concern for their pro-
blems and performance, and
care in evaluating their work.

The satisfaction of students
with the instruction they are
receiving at the time they are
receiving it is an important
ingredient in the morale of an
institution. Through
interviews, letters, or_evalua-.
tion forms, students will be
called upon to testify to their
opinions regarding an instruc-
tor and their perceptions of his
or her effectiveness.

regarding the instructor’s im-
pact on the intellectual life of
the College generally, his or her
interest in other disciplines, and
the relationships of his or her
particular discipline to other
disciplines within the liberal
arts framework.

With regard to the third
criterion --, exemplification of
the intellectual and moral
value’ for which the College
stands -- evidence will be
sought from students, chairman
and colleagues in three areas:
(a) concern for students, (b)
service to the institution, and
(c} service to the wider commu-
nity.

Davidson College’s emphasis
on service in each of these areas
stems from its belief-as a —
Christian liberal arts college
that it is the function of
liberally educated men and wo-
men to lead lives of service to
others and that it is imperative
that the members of the faculty
in their own lives serve as
examples.

(A) Concern for students may
be exemplified by the candi-
date’s availability to students,
concern for their problems, and
care and promptness in evalua-
ting their work. The willingness
to serve as a faculty adviser
both to underclassmen and to
majors is an important factor in
this area, as is the faculty
member's willingness to share
personal experiences with stu-
dents and to help them on an
individual basis to realize their
own potential.

(B) Service to the institution
may be demonstrated in a
variety of ways -- participation
and leadership in committee.
work at the faculty level, active
participation in decisions at the
departmental lével, willingness
to speak to groups of parents,
trustees, or alumni, helping to

3. Department chairmen

Although at Davidson de.
partment chairmen are not con-
sidered administrative officers,
nonetheless, because of their
responsibility for coordination
of the work of the department,
including encouragement of the
continuing professional deve-
lopment of its members, they
have an important role in the
evaluation process.

Normally it will be the chair-
man who conducts the most
extensive review of the instruc-
tor’s course work, including sy]-
labi, tests, and grades awarded,
as well as the instructor’s re-
search, publications, papers
and contributions to the depart-
ment generally in the evolution
of educational policy, participa-
tion in the development of
library holdings, and so forth.

Chairmen may visit the clas-
ses of members of the faculty on

priateness of materials selected,___
and indications that the in-
structor’s courses are reflecting
current developments in the
field.

Evidence will also be sought

willingness to work for the
welfare of others in the context
of church, town, state, nation,
and world through such organi-
zations as church and civic
groups, political organizations,
or other religious social, hono-
rary, special interest, or athletic
groups. ;
