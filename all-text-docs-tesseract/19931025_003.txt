Dating Games

The events were originally designed
exclusively for fraternities

By Sally Stone &
Rachel Dunifon

Today the weekends known
as Homecoming, Midwinters and
Spring Frolics bring to mind fra-
ternity-oriented date functions that
dominate the entire weekend. Not
so long ago, however, these events
were something completely dif-
ferent.

Homecoming, Midwinters,
and Spring Frolics were conceived
in the late 1940s, after the trustees
allowed dancing on campus. Ac-

cording to Dean of Students Will

Terry, these events were “frantic”
weekends in which hundreds of
females from colleges throughout
the Southeast vacationed in Belk

dorm, as their hosts doubled or
tripled with their friends to make
space for them.

Dances were held in Johnston
Gym, and involved the whole stu-
dent body, mingling in their for-
mal attire and dancing tothe sounds
of big band music. Although each
fraternity, as well as the indepen-
dent students, occupied sections of
the gym, the focus was on the dance
floor, where the whole college in-
teracted.

The more rebellious Davidson
students of the 1960s did not find
big band music to their liking, and
their fraternity parties moved off-
campus for the big weekends.
Following the admission of alco-

hol toon-campus parties, date func-
tions returned to campus in 1969.

The year 1972brought women
to Davidson and the conception of
the women’s eating houses. By
design, women’s date functions
were scheduled separately rather
than all in one weekend like frater-
nity functions.

Today, Davidson’s main date
functions continue to be fraternity-
oriented while women’s occasions
are held individually throughout
the year.

With only 60% of Davidson
men joining houses, a large num-
ber are excluded from these frater-
nity-led events. According to
Patterson Court president Julie

Petty, male and female students on _

the whole express some dissatis-
faction with big weekend date func-
tions. Senior Merrill Earnestshares
this view. Although a member of

a fraternity, he believes that date

functions such as Homecoming do
not promote community on the
Davidson campus. They can be
uncomfortable for males not in fra-
ternities, as well as for females
who do not have dates. Addition-
ally, as a senior, he feels that the
novelty of date functions has worn
off for him.

Fellow seniors Ed Denning
and Greg Livers believe that the
quality of a date function varies,
depending upon one's date. On the
whole, though, Denning enjoys the
variety that date functions add to
the monotonous life on Patterson
Court.

On the female side, sopho-
more Amanda Davis also enjoys
big date weekends. However, she
notes that this is due to the fact that
her boyfriendisina fraternity. She
acknowledges that, while they are

often fun, date functions are “not
all that inclusive,” and that
Davidson lacks opportunities for
independents and other students
on the big weekends.

Independent senior Michael
Oehler says that the only reason
that he would have joined a frater-
nity would be to participate in such
events. However, efforts are being
made to make such weekends more
fun for the entire campus.

SGA senator Brad Hilsmier
organized the masquerade ball on
Saturday, which was advertised as
a campus-wide event, rather than
just for independent students.
Hilsmier is trying to start a new
trend of increased social opportu-
nities for all Davidson students on
the big weekends. Similar cam-
pus-wide events will be held on
future weekends, such as Midwin-
ters and Spring Frolics.

Graduate school advice offered by Careers Of

By Scott Windham

Students who have taken one
ofthe graduate school testsoncam-
pus this semester, the MCAT,
LSAT, or GRE, are familiar with
the Office of Career Services. Carol
Jordan and her co-workers at Ca-
reer Services are the ones who ad-
minister those dread exams tohap-
less souls.

, Jordan wants students to know
that Career Services offers much
more in the field of graduate study
than just graduate school place-
ment exams.

The Careers library on the first
floor of the Julia Johnston house is
stocked with information that will
help students with each step of the
graduate school process.

Library assistant Ann Melton
recommends the Barron’s and
Princeton Review series of study
guides to help students prepare for

the aforementioned exams as well —

as other references to aid in select-
ing and applying to graduate
schools.

In addition to the six-volume
Peterson’s Guides to Graduate
Study, the library contains sepa-

rate guides to specialized fields of
study from Business to Psychol-

ogy, as well as books on writing

top-notch personal statements and
application essays.

The library also owns Career
Services’ recently-revised Guide
to Graduate and Professional
Study, a compilation designed to
help students plan their path to
graduate school. :

Computer printouts listing
Davidson alumni in graduate
school are also available, as is the
Gourman Report ranking schools
by discipline.

Students interested in finan-
cial aid for graduate study might
consult the library information
concerning scholarships, grants,
and loans.

The library also houses cop-
ies of the GAPSFAS form, an ap-
plication necessary at many uni-
versities to receive financial aid.

Staff members note that stu-
dents may also get information
from other sources on campus.

"That's disgusting, let's see it again"

By Wendy Lee

“That’s disgusting; let’s see it
again” is the mentality that many
Japanese citizens hold of the United
States, according to Chris Field, an
American correspondent fora Japa-
nese TV station.

Field, a Dean Rusk speaker,
gave a presentation on Japanese
views of Americans Thursday,
October 21 in the 900 Room of the
Union.

Excerpts from Field’s work as

areporter were replete with scenes
of shootings, fires, riots, and hos-
tage situations confirming the fact
that the Japanese are as fascinated
by tabloid TV as much as Ameri-
cans.

Field provided reasons why
the Japanese media heavily covers
the U.S. because the U.S. is the
world’s political and financial cen-
ter and the image of Hollywood is
reinforced.

Another reason Field noted

was a superiority/inferiority com-
plex amongst Japanese.

Their image is reinforced by
viewing the decayed state of the
U.S.; however, they are also afraid
that Americans will “bash” them.

Field said that a mini-revolu-

‘tion inside Japan with a recession

and government changes is alter-
ing economic andcultural attitudes.
“We know everything there is to
knowabout America. Tell ussome-
thing new.”

FEELING
ALONE?
