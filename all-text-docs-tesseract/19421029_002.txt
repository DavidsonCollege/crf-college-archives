Our Viewpoint...

Whether fair or unfair, true or false,
there is an attitude towards the youth
of,our country on which we have often
found occasion to comment as it regards
faculty, administration, and trustée re-
lations.with the students,..It-is now. -evi-
dencing itself in national public opinion.

We réfer to the enigmatic ideas which
the American people harbor as to the
soundness and capabilities of the eighteen
and nineteen-year-olds.

Our newspapers daily exalt this sec-
tion of American manhood and desig-
nate it the hope and potential savior of
the nation. They tell us that this group,
of which the Davidson student body,
like all college contingents, is. largély
composed, will make the best soldiers of
any in the Jand.

They intorm us that we are at exactly
the right age and stage of physical de-
velopment, as well as the period of form-
ative psychology, to receive afd absorb
army discipline. They. inform us, in
short, that they are ready to consider
us as men and as soldiers. es

In thessame breath or on the same
page, however, these front page philoso-
phers (and congressional contradiction-
ists) will begin to hedge. They say
that we are old enough and morally
strong enough to offer our lives in their
protection, but that-we-do-not-have the
moral fortitude to face the personal

temptations of life.

They decide that the army, which has .

proved its discipline. by cleaning out
every city near which it has a canip; will
not provide in this respect for its men,
and that it falls within the limits of the

politicians’ duty to take over in this”

respect, a matter in which the military
authorities have ‘proved them notably
lax.

AN Pyesénis

They accuse the army of having no
knowledge of the length of time neces-
sary to train its own men. They are
like a patient who has paid an expert to
preseribe and are not willing to swallow

their medicine.

It would appear that we who are
affected most, we of the class in ques-
tion, should be allowed to express our-
selves. We think we speak almost unan-
imously when we say that we are ready
and glad of the chance to serve our coun-
try in any and every way.

We do not demand, as some seem to
think, the right to vote or any special
privileges. We only ask that if and
when we are called that we be called all

the way. We beg that we have the
opportunity of training with veteran
troops and seeing action when our mili-
tary leaders consider us Teady,

We ask that we be considered moral
nfen capable of solving our own pro-
lems and meeting our own temptations
We ask that

the public accept our faith in the leaders

as well as physical men.

of the army and in ourselves.

We think we have a just basis for our
requests in the conduct of our comrades
who have already seen fit to enter the
service. We believe ourselves, capable
of living up to their example, which
should convinee anyone, we think, of the
seriousness of our purposes,

Perhaps our actions in the past have

Per-
haps some of our water fights and win-

justified suspicions of our aims,

dow breakings have been adoiescent,
But we think the increased maturity of
the average youthful mind has passed
every test in any real crisis.

We ask no favors, then. We ask no
exceptions nor lightened tasks or re-
sponsibilities. We simply ask the con-

sideration we believe we have earned.

the English language is a lack of

How about “Love’? That also has
come to mean practically nothing,
but you hesitate to use a word that,
in itself, could have vast implica-
tions. Besides, you’ye had but one
date with the girl.

At this point you rack your brain
for ideas, and-remember that some-
one used to sign her letters “Al-

about “Fondly”?

Little has been said from the

men and for college. men
everywhere in these stirring times
than the thought uttered there by
President Cunningham on the open.
ing day of school and—again last
week, concerning staying in college
and applying oneself to the task of
absorbing all the information and
practical knowledge one is able in
the month§ of grace left to the col-
lege man in the near future.

You will remember that Dr. Cun-
ningham emphasized the crying need
felt by the government
trained leaders which
from college campuses, and the fact

now ior

must come
that the government was not hand-
ing out special privileges to college
men simply because they were col-
lege men, but because this need ex.
isted and must be filled. Leaving
the men in college to receive those
qualities of leadership was the most
eXpedient way of meeting these va-
cancies. For this reason and for
this reason only, reserves for every
branch of the service had been cre-
ated, and it would be no shirking
of -patriotic duty to sign with one
of these reserves to obtain the time
to finish the training that one needs
to fit himself for the task that lies
ahead.

Placed in this light, the unpatriotic
aspect would lie in not following
up to its full advantage the oppor-
tunity we possess here at Davidson
of rendering valuable service to the
country» even while we continue
our seemingly ordinary lives here
on the Wildcat campus. The United
States Government has judged it
wise to leave valuable potential ma.
terial for the armed services in
school for an admittedly uncertain
period of time—as long as feasible
to the best interest of the nation;
evidently they believe that the edu-
cational institutions of America are
well-prepared to provide their stu-
dents with training that they will
use in the dangerous game ahead;

this being” so, and the: authorities °

having fulfilled their part of the
bargain, it remains our job—our
patriotic, solemn duty—to continue
to perform our part of the bargain
with renewed diligence and to the
utmost of our ability. In doing so,
in all fairness to ourselves, we

should not overlook the long-range
side of the thing, When the-war-is
over,/and millions of men are re-
turning to civilian life, and to busi-
ness competition, those of us who
did not see fit to finish our educa-
tion may find ourselves regrettully
looking back to the Opportunities
We passed up at this time in our

can insure now

in this consideration, we
