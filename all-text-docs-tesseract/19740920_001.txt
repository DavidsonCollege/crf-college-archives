Displeased Coeds Petition:
‘Spencer On Laundry Issue

By NANCY NORTHCOTT
Staff Writer

The controversy that arose
last year over the laundry
situation at Davidson has star-
ted again.

It bagan last year when
Steve Canterbury pointed out
in a column in THE DAVID-
SONIAN that the college was
discriminating against un-
married male students by
making the $130 laundry fee

mandatory for them and not
for women or married stu-

dents.

That aspect of the situation
has been remedied: this year,
all unmarried students must
pay for laundry ‘service as
part of the comprehensive fee.

“The college  .acted
typically,’’ Canterbury com-
mented. ‘‘The gross un-
fairness of the laundry was ex-
pressed in my column. And
later, in a referendum, the
students favored an optional
laundry; therefore the college
made the laundry MAN-

DATORY for ALL students.

It’s beyond the realm’ "of
reason. -

“What to,do? Every timeja

Spencer, with a copy fo an
alumnus friend. Perhaps

therein lies the solution,’’ Can.
terbury advised.

The referendum to which
Canterbury referred was held
last spring. In it, 92 percent of
the voting students favored
having a laundry of some sort;
most preferred the idea of an
optional laundry service.

However, College Business
Manager Robert Currie in-
dicated that this is not feasible
financially.

Currie indicated that the
college will be flexible; if
students don’t want the laun-
dry, it can be eventually
phased out. Some of this is
already being done by not
replacing employees who
retire. For this academic
year, however, the status quo
will remain.

This does not end the con-
troversy. The main complaint
that many students have with
the laundry is shrinkage. This
makes many of the women
students somewhat hesitant
about sending anything they
valuetothe laundry. <=

Although: many have not
tried the laundry, most prefer
to do their own clothes.

At a meeting in Little Dor-
..mitory Monday night, many of
“the upperclass women agreed
that their dissatisfaction
comes from having to pay the

They agreed that the best
thing would be to make the
laundry fee optional, as far as .

cerned.

Barring that, they
established three objectives:
to have the coin slots removed
from the washers, <to~have
machines on each floor, and to
get facilities for ironing put on
each floor.

The women signed a petition
to be sent to College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. as an
expression of concern over the
laundry fee.

“© just feel that last year
most of the coeds were

arrangements that existed in

organized the meeting.

Grey Building Gets Funds

From Unexpected Revenues

By BRUCE CORSER

Senior News Editor
Having received unexpected in-
come from several sources, Davidson
College has realized a reserve

estimated at $312,000 from the:

operating budget for the fiscal year
1973-74.

This reserve has been designated
for the funding of the $440,000
renovation of the Grey Building from
the college library into the college
union.: An earlier grant of $50,000
from the Arthur Vining Davis Foun-
dations’ of Miami, plus the reserve
funds, leave an$80,000 deficit which
has yet to be raised.

Comptroller Robert: W. Davidson
indicated that the balance would
probably come from interest on
various funds.

‘“We feel that we can come up with

. $440,000 for the union renovation.

However, building materials such as
steel and concrete have really gone
up since July 1,” said Davidson.

Although an audit is not, complete,
unofficial figures indicate that the
college received income above
budget expectations in ’73-74 in the
following major areas:

-$63,500 in tuition. and fees,

primarily because fewer students :

than expected dropped out of school
or transferred during the year.

-$174,000 from the current fund in-
vestments averaging almost 10 per-
cent interest.

-$32,000 in additional: interest. in-
come from the endowment, trust nae:
ds, and the Annual Fund.

College President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. said, “We feel very fortunate

to have had such a good year,
especially in view of the capital ex-
penditures and increased operating
costs just ahead.” .

“‘The trustees and the ad-
ministration are committed to a-
balanced budget, and are pleased we
have finished another year in the
black,” he added.

As favorable as these sources of in-
come have been to Davidson’s finan-
cial status, they won’t obviate the
probable necessity of increasing the
tuition next year.

Davidson remarked, ‘‘I would think
that there would have to be some in-
crease.: But all we can do is recom-
mend such an increase to the
trustees.”
