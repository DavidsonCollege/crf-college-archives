Gavignaud finds U.S. land

of blue skies, new styles

By ED TRUMBULL

Mademoiselle Genivieve Gav-
ignaud had never been in the
United States before she came
to Davidson this term as part of
the Davidson/University Paul
Valery in Montpellier exchange.
Nor did she speak English. But
that’s getting better. ‘‘Students
have offered to give me English
courses,’” she said.

She has never taught in an
American-type university, even
though she’s been teaching for
ten years. That was the major
reason she chose to come over,
to experience teaching in the
American university system.
“They’re very different,”’ she
said, ‘I’m getting used to this
one now.” .

Since she has been here only a
month and a half, Gavignaud
didn’t want to make any value
judgments about the two differ-
ent systems. For that, she
thinks she’ll need more perspec-
tive. She has been struck by one
difference; the strong campus
life here. ‘‘In France, there isn’t
any campus life.’’

Teaching here is different. In
Montpellier, Gavignaud teaches
History, especially agrarian
history of the Southwest of
France. Here she’s teaching
Conversation and Composition
and a Senior seminar on the
historical context of literature.

I asked her if there were
problems with teaching these
courses, and she said no. Her
degree qualifies her to teach any
of the liberal arts. She is trying
to give her students an idea of
the methods of writing French
analytical papers. ‘‘This me-
thod is the same, whether one is
treating philosophy, history or
literature.”’

The classroom styles in the
two systems are also different.
Here students and professors
are encouraged to deal with
each other personally, in small
classes. ‘‘The French classes are
often lectures, with little stu-

dent participation.’’ She thinks
that there ought to be a balance
between the two types of clas-
ses. Though small classes are
beneficial, larger ones are equal-
ly valid in a complete education.

She does not want to be
considered just a teacher. Re-
search is also important for her.
She has worked on a history of
Langued’oc, which will appear
in the spring. Currently she is
working on articles treating
relationships between rural and
urban society in her native
Roussillon.

I asked her what she would
do when she returns to Mont-
pellier in February. She will
have to make up for the classes
she missed by coming here.
“That was the only way I was
allowed to come,”’ she said.

And finally, I asked what she
missed most from her native
Southern France. ‘‘The Medi-
terranean. But you have the
same blue sky.”

‘Davidson, don't you just love comedy?’

By JAMES FUNSTEN
Staff Correspondent

If you told your mother you
wanted to be a comedian, she
would probably either burst out
laughing or say ‘‘that’s not
funny’’. A stand-up comedian
faces both of these reactions in
an audience. And comedian Jim
Hanna of Charlotte, who kept
the good times rolling in the 900
Room Homecoming Weekend,

says he likes the challenge an ~

audience presents.

The challenge of comedy lies
in the nature of the art and in
people’s reactions to it. Comedy
is the art of dialogue. Unlike
music, people cannot listen
“with one ear” and be enter-
tained by it. Because a come-
dian requires an audience’s
undivided attention the audi-
ence tends to have high expec-
tations of the performer.

me laugh”’ or ‘This guy better
be good” surface in audiences
when a comedian steps up to
perform.

Jim Hanna gave a lively step
up to the 900 Room stage
Saturday night. He wore a
beige-yellow suit. His long
brown hair and slightly hun-
ched shoulders gave him an
almost juvenile look as he gazed
out at the audience. Hanna is
not a man given to silence, so he
quickly went to work on captur-
ing his audience. By speaking
about Davidson, then asking
questions and joking along with
the answers, Hanna managed to
get the audience’s attention. He
then turned to his prepared
routine to get the laughs rolling
and develop rapport.

At first, audience response to
his questions was minimal, but
Hanna just chuckled and said
‘‘Davidson, Davidson, gosh
darn it, don’t you just love
comédy?’’ As he told about a
new cereal called Rice Quaa-

ludes (Snap, Crackle, Puhhh. .

.) and about the fortune he was
going to make by marketing
Sheer Energy briefs for men
(with the all day massage),
things loosened up. Ko

Jim Hanna has lived. in
Charlotte many years and
comes from a family of come-
dians; his father and sister are
both professionals. Hanna re-
cently spent a year in Los
Angeles, where he frequerited
night spots in order to study
other comedians. There he
learned how important the
makeup of an audience is to a
comedian’s success. ‘‘One show
a performer would come off

‘really well, and then the next he

would use the same jokes, same
timing —everything—and he
would bomb!”’

Hanna’s work in North Caro-

lina centers around the Comedi

Inn at the Camelot Restaurant
on Providence Road. The inn is

unique in Charlotte—its enter-
tainment is limited to comedy.
Part of Hanna’s work at the
Comedi Inn is ‘‘absorbed in

educating and furthering new

comedians.”’ By holding work-

shops and having ‘‘open mike”
