Hopes to improve on 2-8 record

\

Farrell stakes hopes on wing-T

By JIM SITTERSON

Despite a very young team,
head football coach Ed Farrell
is looking forward to his second
season at Davidson with high
hopes.

Last year was one of trans-
ition for the Wildcats. A new
coach, a different system, and a
lack of recruiting combined to a
poor 2-7 showing.

“This year however, we have
more basis for optimism and
should make great strides,”
Farrell stated recently. “We
are pleased with our upper-
classmen, they’re a group com-
mitted to our philosophy of
football, and the freshmen are a
good group both talent and
number wise,” Farrell contin-
ued.

Davidson will enter the
season with a new Wing-T
formation on offense. The
Wing-T is a versatile system
which involves the use of a
running quarterback. “It pro-
vides a great opportunity to

bring four runners into the
‘game,’ Farrell said.

The Wing-T enables a more
balanced attack and forces the
defense to over-commit itself
according to Farrell. The new
system will place a heavy

emphasis on deception and
quickness in the backfield and
sophisticated line play.

“A typical play starts with
the fullback going up the mid-
dle, the halfback sweeping one
way, and the quarterback the
other,” said Farrell, adding
that, “We will attack inside,
outside, and pass.”

Hopefully, if one aspect of
the offense is successful, the
defense will over-react to stop
it, this providing a vulnerabi-
lity in another area. This re-
flects a portion of Farrell’s
coaching philosophy.

“We scored all our touch-
downs by passing last year, but
we never would have com-
pleted them unless the defense
was trying to stop our running
game.”

The only drawback to the
Wing-T according to Farrell is
that with an emphasis on
deception and execution, the
timing takes a while to develop.

‘“‘An execution-oriented
offense takes time,” ‘Farrell
commented. It should be noted

however that the ‘Cats don’t -

begin their season until Sept.
27 which should provide time t«
develop the necessary timing.
Devensively things are a
little more predictable for Dav-

idson this year. The defense
which gave up 346 points in
nine games last year should be
able to enjoy more success this
year. An experienced squad
and only minor changes could
make the defense a pleasant
surprise this fall.

“We have more veterans on
the defense, the ends, tackles,
and linebackers are all exper-
ienced, the secondary is the
only relatively untested part of
our defense,” Farrell noted.

The defense will align itself
in a 5-2 formation with a down
noseguard. This defense is not
very different from last year’s
according to Farrell. The only
innovation will be the down
noseguard on the line of scrim-
mage.

“Last year we had a man in
the same position, only he was
standing up. and was a few
steps off the line,” Farrell
commented.

“The noseguard is the key to
this defense; he has to clog the
middle of the line with his
quickness,” Farrell added.

Davidson's schedule opens
with VMI, and will provide a
stiff challenge to the Cats. The
Keydets are heavily favored to
repeat as Southern Conference
Champions this season.

“We're happy with this sche-
dule; there’s no single team

that’s untouchable,” Farrell
said.

Cats lose by 3-0

23 shots on goal after their
second tally. A Madison wing
penetrated deep into the Cats’
corner and forced Perz to
charge out to cut off the angle.
He centered the ball and it was
kicked past Barringer for the
final score of the afternoon.

Head coach Chip Stone was
pleased with the performance
of his club, despite being
understandably dissappointed
with the outcome.

“We controlled the ball very
well,” Stone commented. “We
had many chances to score,
one-on-one situations and good
shots, but did not put them
a

Madison does, however, have
a strong team, indicating the
relative strength possessed by
the Cats. Stone noted that “this
is the best team ever to play
soccer at Davidson.”

On the schedule for the
season, Stone indicated that
the Cats have a tough road

ahead. Upon being asked how
many wins he could see on the
schedule at this point, he
replied that there was only one
sure victory. The rest he
labeled as toss-ups.
Considering the overall
strength of the team, Stone
expressed pride in the
defensive ability of the squad.
“When Perz gets accustomed
to our fullbacks, we will have
an extremely strong defense,”
Stone contended. “No other
team should score as many as

three goals against us.”

Prospects for the Southern
Conference appear very good,
in Stone’s eyes. Appalachian
ranks as the _ pre-season
favorite, while William and
Mary has attracted some
attention.

“Appalachian will be tough,”
admitted Stone. “But we should
be able to beat them.” He also
noted that he did not think
William and Mary could “stay
on the same field with
Madison.”
