Fine Arts Construction |And (Country Cricket Teams
Caps Year Of Planning |

By DON SAUNDERS

Davidsonian Managing Editor

With construction set to begin this week on the John R. Cunningham Music.

and Fine Arts Building, over a year’s wor:h of planning and preparation has been
completed. The general contract for construction was signed with the Barger Con-
struction Company of Mooresville.

Final preliminary plans for
the building were drawn up last
May. In a DAVIDSONIAN in-
terview this week Robert A.
Currie; Business Manager of
the college. gave several rea-
sons for the delay in the letting
of the contract.

ideas, from the student
body and faculty for the fa-
cilities in the new building
“were made last spring. “We
passed all this information
on to the architect,” said
Currie. “During the month of
dune we made several trips
to Winston-Salem to meet
with Mr. Lashmit concerning
changes in the building.” The
engineering firm of Lashmit,
James, Brown, and Pollock is.
handling the architectural
details.

“We were accompanied to
Winston-Salem by Mr. Russell
Graves, a lighting specialist in
the drama department at Chapel
Hill. He reviewed all our plans
at a final meeting in Winston-
Salem late in June,” said Cur-
rie,

The acoustical firm of Bolt.
Beranek and Brown, of Cam-
bridge. Massachusetts, also act-
ed as consultants on the build-
ing plans. Their specifications
called for unusual construction

techniques,

“During the month of July,
there was no activity, except

the architect completing the
plans,” Currie said. He ex-
plained that several  last-
minute changes were made
by the acoustical consultants,
and that Lashmit took longer
than he anticipated in draw-
ing up the final specifications.

Plans were complete about
August 1. Bids were received
on August 30, with the Barger
firm making a low bid of $519.-
300. Currie stressed that this
figure included only basic con-
struetion costs. ‘The figure
does not include running heat
and light to the building, land-
scaping, drains, furnishings,
architect's fees, etc.’ Total cost
will probably run close to $650,-
000.

Another item still to be con-
tracted for is the stage wagon,
an unusual feature of the Fine
Arts Building. This huge stage.
complete with lights and cur-
tains, will be mounted on roll-
ers so that it can be stored off-

stage, and set up for use with
dramatic productions only. The
permanent stage area will thus
be left acoustically fitted for
musical performances.

“The acoustical engineers
had two problems to work
out,” said Currie. “First, they
hed to isolate the rooms from
one another, and second, they
head to meke each room. as

As A Conservative

A soft-spoken Bob Gavin, Republican gubernatorial |
candidate. quietly spoke the words which produced mild
political turmoil on campus Tuesday. The sanford (town, |
not surname) lawyer appeared in chapel, delivering a
brief talk and answering questions from the floor, and

also attended a reception in
room.

Gavin's chief request was for
a two-party system in North
Carolina. His appearance on
campus, along with his two-
party request, stirred lively
discussion between campus Re-
publicans and Democrats for
the remainder of the day. |

Republican candidate Gavin
presented himself as “‘the con-
servative candidate” {or gover-
nor in his chapel address.

PRETTY GIRL ANALOGY

The Republican distinguish-
ed consérvative from reaction-
ary and radical with. the aid
of his “pretty girl’ analogy.
When offered a blind date with
“the prettiest gir) in ‘Meclkien-
burg County’ Gavin. said. the
‘reactionary. would turn it.down
beeause the date would not be
properly chaperoned.,

On the other hand, the rad-
ical in his dirty shirt. and blue
jeans would climb onto his mo-
torcycle and speed headlong in-
to an acceotance of the date.

The conservative, Gavin con-
tinued, would not make a rapid
decision. Rather, he would ex-
amine the finances he had avail-
able for the date and several
other factors before making his
decision. (Incidentally, the con-
servative would decline.)

SOUTHERN INFLUENCE

Gavin said that the South has
lost influence in national poli-
ties. The influence will be re-
gained when the South returns
to the two-party. system, he
maintained.

Gavin concluded his chapel
appearance by stating. “I: will
appoint the best men I can find
to state offices.’ He explained
that if elected he will {cel ob-
ligated to the Democrats be-
cause “they will help elect me.”
No state employees will lose
their jobs because of their po-
litical affiliations, he said.

At a= reception following

his honor in the union ball-

chapel. Gavin gave some sur-
prisingly liberal answers to the
questions put. lo him by stu-
dents.

SCHOOL INTEGRATION ]
“Lot

On the problem of school in-
tegration, Gavin said, “I would |
certainly hate to see any schoo 5 |
closed .. . I look at it from a!
logal standpoint. That’s the on: |.“
ly way I look at it. I don't thin:
a goyernor ‘should lecture ta
people about morals.” !

Continuing, he said. “The|
next step is-for the leaders to
sit @down and work it out. We
need leaders who recognize and |
obey. the law. You're going to
have to have compromise on
both sides.”

He added. that he back the!
Pearsall plan. North Carolina is |
not ready .for total integration, !
he said. It will only come about
when the people want it.

INDIAN STUDENTS

Gavin, himself, called atten-
tion to the recent attempt by
several Indian students to enter
Dunn High School. He explain-
ed that the Indian students had
been promised that three new
classrooms would be added to
the school which they were at-
tending.

Soon afterwards, however,
they were told that there was
no money for the classrooms.
Gavin said. “It looked like
somebody was not acting in
good. faith. I think it would
have been good practice to ad-

mit. them (te Dunn High
School).

Gavin made it clear however,
that under normal circum

stances he felt. it best for the
Indians to attend their regular
school. He added he understood
the students applied for admit-
tance mainly to bring attention
to the fact that the new class-
rooms had not been built.

-air-conditioning equipment. Or-

nearly perfect as possible,
acoustically.”

The second problem was ap-
proached in an unusual way.

Walls in the music listening

rooms will be “splayed,” or
angled from floor to ceiling. In
the band rehearsal room, the
chorus room, and the auditor-
ium. a second wall will be built,
with. metal baffling and wood
strips, which will permit sound
to reverberate behind them. To
more completely “deaden” these
rooms, heavy draperies,can be
drawn over these false walls.

The exterior of the building
has been planned to conform
with the rest of the original
quadrangle. it will have the
traditional four columns,
made of brick under a stucco
cost. The center section,
housing the auditorium, will
be two stories high. The wings
will be of only one story.
On the roof of each wing a

high brick facing wall has been
planned, to house heating and

iginally two tall false chimneys
were to conceal the equipment,
but they have been eliminated
in the final plans. Currie assur-
ed THE DAVIDSONIAN that
this added wall will not be
visible from ground  leével
around the building.

The auditorium will be the
central part of the building.
Interestingly enough. the stage
wagon idea was suggested to the
architect by Ervin Duggan, and
was modeled roughly after the
auditorium in the new Jewett
Fine Arts Center at Wellesley

Dr. Martin at first refused
to voice his opinion, stating,
“It seems to me that if any
question exists which is a mat-
ter for which the student body!
ought to assume responsibility.
this is it.”

“It seems to me, though. as
an individual, that the type of

certainly does not have a place

President Martin then went

Editor s Note: This is the
second in a series of articles

written by the Richardson
Scholars on customs and char-
acteristics of their homelands,
cr on their impressions of
Davidson.

Cricket is generally consider-
ed a typically English game,
and without attempting the for-
midable task of explaining the
rules of the game, I would like
to.give some idea of the status
of cricket in English society as
I have known it.

I will begin with the form of

cricket with which I am most
acquainted — school cricket. In
all schools in which games are
organized to any great extent,
and which have grounds avail-
able, cricket is a major sport
in the summer; the schools to
which I refer principally are
the public schools and grammar
schools.

The standing of the cricket
team may affect somewhat
the stending of the schoo! in
the eyes of the public, if only
because important cricket
matches are reported in “The
Times.” Moreover, since the
Program of our school team
involved its members in about
seventeen hours of nlay a
week, it can be seen that
some sacrifice in general
school life must often be
made for the geme.

After school, cricket  con-
tinues in three streams: village
cricket. club cricket, and coun-
ty cricket. Village cricket is
usually played in the evening
in the two hours available after
work until the light fails. Thus
full..length games are impos-
sible, and “twenty over” crick-
et is played, which restricts
the length of the innings.

After the game the players
often repair to fhe “pub”. the
social center of most villages.
Their cricket, like their heer
drinking, is a serious social ac-
tivity,

These who aspire to greater
heights are able to play in
their county teams. Alf coun-
ti2s have two Xt‘s filled large.
ly by professionals; of these
the less good are often mem-
bers of the ground sta‘f of
the county cricket club.
County teams are crad>4 on
a naticnal table, and for the
professionals, ths incentive to
win is provided by a bowus.

icapidly as is in evidence in the
United Naticns.

The cricket played under
these conditions is very ser-
ious, and the first XI matches
last for three days, (playing for
six and a half hours a day),
while second XI matches last
for two days.

In international cricket, the
games last for five days, and are
followed enthusiast i c ally
throughout the county. The
players can be either amatuers
or professionals.

In as much as in England
everyone can play cricket at his
own level, and the interest in
games of all types is consider-
able, it is fair to say that crick-
et is a thriving sport, and not
to be considered a relic of “Ye
Olde England.”

'Umbrella Cult Founder
Reviews Davidson Days

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Davidsonian Associate Editor
Ever hear of John Harmon?

He's the man responsible

for that black umbrella vou carry. Harmon. class of ’56,

was the first to carry an umbrella at Davidson. He made them a fad; thev became

a tradition.

He chalked up a phenomenal
academic record — then flatly
refused a bid to Phi Beta Kap-
a.

a]

“A CHARACTER”

Faculty members remember
him as “interesting.” His con-
temporaries sspeak of him as
‘a character — a nonconform-
ist.”

Harmon returned to David-
son for a visit last week.

We interviewed him in the
snack bar of the College Union.
“Nonconformist? I wasn’t a
non-conformist. I just wasn't in-

terested in what the rest of the .

people here were interested in.
When I was here they all be-
lieved in the usual things—you
know, Mother, God, Country,

that sort of thing. I just was- |

n't interested, and when I found

|

that my interests coincided with |

other peoples’, I didn't let it
bother me.”

He lit a cigarette.
JUST PRACTICALITY

“The umbrella wasn't non-
conformity, just practicality. It
was cheaper to lose an um-
brella than a raincoat. Now I
hear that if you don‘t carry one
around here, you’re considered
rather strange.”

We were asking him what
he ‘considered Davidson's great-
est weakness. The juke box
blared, and Harmon scowled.

“That's it, Rock and Roll.
When I was here, I was presi-
dent of the Union Committee
and I said it would be over my
dead body that we got a juke
box. I understand you people
didn't get that one until last
lyear. Well, it’s terrible.

“I don't like to think of Da-
vidson in terms of weaknesses,
but I can tell you what the
greatest thing about Davidson
is. It's the spirit. Whenever
Davidson graduates get togeth-
er, the conversation is always
about Davidson. It’s not like
that with people from other
| schools. Davidson people al-
ways start remembering the
fantastic things that go on here,
and outsiders are always fasci-
nated.”

MORE FREEDOM

“You've got more freedom:
here than we had. There’s evi-
dently no censorship, and that’s
good, up to a point. But-a little
bit of censorship is a good
thing.”

We asked him why he turn-
ed down the Phi Bete bid.

“I was tired of seeing people
after tangible reward, I  sup-
posc. And Phi Beta Kappa
seemed so final — like the end
of everything, I came“here with
the desire to get a Phi Bete
bid, but when it came it scared

me a little — like the last rites | |

Gr something.’
