Obituary Number 3:

DYING DEMAGOGUE

WILSON STARR...

By DICK MOREHEAD

“Hippodrome of hypocrisy, hip-
podrome of hypocrisy, that’s what
it is,” said he with a twitch, a
twinkle, and a bang on the table
that almost turned over the
glasses. As we moved closer, we
saw that this red faced man was
surrounded by evident devo-
tees, Y scouts, and the oddly
curious. Puzzled and perplexed, my
buddy turned to me and _ said,
“What is this madness?" Where-
upon, I took him aside and re-
lated some of the fascinating facts
and figures on Wilson C. Starr,
180 pounds of diabolical intellect,
vivid imagination, amazing experi-
ence, and terrestial tastes.

Mr. Starr, better known as
“Brother Beelzebub” among those

‘who know him best, is a senior
according to the latest report from
official sources. In private, he ad-
mits that his home is somewhere
in “the Switzerland of America,”
West Virginia. A pre-med by
choice. he is preparing for Duke
graduate school with hopes set on
becoming an all around, finan-
cially secure M.D. .

Wf you wonder who pilots that
“big black thing” up, down, and
eround U.S. 21, ponder no more.
Mr. Starr conveys his person (and
numerous others) around in this
elongated hearse, affectionately
called “Grace.” By definition.
Grace is a sleek, black, eight pas-
senger, custom-built Packard
weighing some 5,500 pounds with
roll up windows between front and
back lounge chairs that make it
a joy for double dating. Its owner
claim that‘she formerly belonged
to Mrs. Henry L. Daughtery. chief
stockholder in Cities Service. al-
though rumor has it that Al Ca-
pone ditched it on a dry run
through W. Va. Grace leads a very
active life. During vacation sprees,
she can be found freighting a load
of mountaineers to “the hills of
home;” over blast weekends, she
conveys couples from Davidson to
extremities; and when not on spe-
cla) “mission” duty, she ferries the
boys—from New York to Natchez,
from Craigy House to Cornelius.
When asked what would happen
to Grace when her owner passed
on to greener pastures, he dramati-
cally replied, “I couldn’t bear to
have her in hands that did not ap-
preciate her. There is only one
thing to do—take her to Catawba
and dynamite her.”

Mr. Starr is a man of distinction
known for his distinguishing tastes.
His sophisticated search for fine
foods takes him all over the east-
ern U. S. Annually, he goes on a
cultural pilgrimage to Washington
for champagne “served in a con-
tinental setting, as it should be
served;” to the Pheasant Farm for
exquisite bird; to New England
for lobster; to the beach for
shrimp; and to Hatties for the
stimulating atmosphere. This past
summer, he conducted a well-at-
tended “Starr Course” on “How to
drink socially,” but was forced to
retire due to a lingering occupa-
tional «disease. A prominent
socialite, he weaves in and out of
Huntington society, where they
serve “Ohio beer—only the rabble
drink that W. Va water.”

A lover of fine animals, Mr.
Starr has surrounded himself with
the best pet birds and fish availa-
ble. He is still in mourning for
his Siamese Fighting Fish who
passed away recently because of
the extreme ‘cold and inconsistent
diet of Fronzen Daphne and tropi-
cal fish food. It is now somewhere
in the Catawba.

Now Cornelius is where the
Starr manse is located. It is 2
small but quiet adequate five-room
house encompassed on the sides by
the Satterfields and a truck driver,
in back by rising foothills, and in
front by a placid lake which often
serves as experimental ground for
nightly nauticals. This manse is
further inhabited by epicureans
Cannon, Hall, and Ponder, who
with our young Socrates of society

AF
° ae

¢

For impeccable taste

make this a center of political,
cultural, social and when unavoida-
ble, intellectual pursuits.

Among other refined abilities,
Mr. Starr is a virtuoso of some
one note. In his greener years, he
battled courageously with Bach,
Brahms, Beethoven, and Brubeck.
Not content with individual
achievement, he also pursued two
piano composers until forced to
relinquish the keyboard when the
instructor became ill. His distinc.
tive interests in music is mostly
responsible for a tremendous col-
lection of records and some 200
odd piano rolls.

These records were formerly
played with penetrating volume by
a revised Capehart model changer,
capable of spinning fifty disks,
front and back without repeating,
stopping, or touch of human hand.
That makes two solid days of
music. He confesses that many a
lost weekend was thus spent soak-
ing up the finer things of life. This
player was also the nemesis of
Georgia dorm, which rocked in the
AM to the Grand Canyon Suite and
tumbled quietly with uncensored
releases in the P. M.

Our subject was also dabbled in
interior decorating. In fact, he
is chairman of that famed design-
ing and decorating committee of
the Kappa Alpha lodge, where
those “telltale tastes” are in strik-
ing evidence. This work of artistic
allusion has aroused much com-
ment, ranging from “that Parisian
poolroom” to the “oriental apart-
ment” by more conservative critics.

Always an admirer of J. P. Mor-
gan,. Mr. Starr traverses financial
circles with fanatic freedom. As
treasurer of his social fraternity,
he establishes assessments, sells
raffle tickets on old furniture, fre.
quents wholesale houses, and gen-
erally bankrupts brothers. As di-
rector of disbursements (self ap-
pointed), he purchases religious
records (“Shake- a hand”), TV
aerials, Confedrate collections,
“The Best of Playboy,” and such
items as one gross of monogram-
med ping pong balls. His treatment
of the books has often been com-
pared to his equally acute manipu-
lation of physics solutions.

A man of critical taste in the
realm of belles lettres, he has also
contributed to the arts a little bit
of his creative ability and aristo-
cratic analyses. He has also pre-
sented many immortal luncheon
lectures, called the “How Series,”
and featuring such subjects as
“The social benefits of million dol-
lar churches,” and “How to get
ahead in a behind world.”

One of Mr. Starr’s more hidden
talents is his lyric ability. His
latest creation is entitled “My Al-
ma Mater” and reads:

“Oh, give me a home

Where the middle class roam,

And the YMCA boys play.

Where seldom is heard

An intelligent word,

And we think about sin once a

day.”

Although most of his work is
now written, he has aspirations of
attaining a place on the shelves of
the Davidsonian Room in later
years.

GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP HINTS:

Starr Scholarship Committee [Essay Contest Open |At Davidson Soon

Gives Advice On Grants

By TOM MORGAN

in the past few months there
have been long lists of graduate
scholarship announcements pub-
lished in the Davidsonien, The
fact that most students fail to real-
ize is that these scholarships could
be won by Davidson students.

According to the Graduate
Scholarship Committee, the key to
winning such scholarship is to begin
preparation early, preferrably in
no later than the sophomore year.
The committee, composed of Pro-
fessors Cumming, Gallent, Labban,
Penk, and Watts, with Prof. Aber-
nethy as chairman, would urge the
student to begin by writing for a
catalog from several graduate
schools in which he might be in-
terested. Also, one might plan a
short trip to the campus of a
schoo! he is considering.

Of primary importance is to take
the courses which are required for
admission by the school. For in-
stance, Latin, calculus, and statis-
ties are necessary in some far re-
moved fields of study. This advice
cannot be overstressed.

Next you should talk with the
faculty member in your major de-
partment and with some member
of the Graduate Scholarship Com-
mittee. If you are interested in
particular scholarships such as
Rhodes Scholarships, see Prof.
Cumming, or Fullbright scholar.
ships, Prof. Watts. For scholar.
ships in science, see Prof. Gallent.

Finally, when you do start fill-
ing out the application and getting
recommendations, be sure to re-

McCutchan in an article in the
Davidsonien earlier in the year:
notify the professor well in ad-
vance that you would like his
recommendation, provide him with
all the data on your college activ-
ities, and get the forms to him as
early as possible.

The gratifying record of stu-
dents in the past who followed the
above plan lends support to its
validity. Last year, for instance,
about 20 awards ranging in stipend
from $900 to $2500 for the first

door track team to Lexington,
ably what everyone expected.

However, things went well for
Davidson. With a team of only
seven men— Gramiey, Ashcraft,
Huffaker, Koonce, Diuguid, Mitch-
ner, and “Mr. 440” (Roswell Mal-
lory), the team did outstanding
work, bringing back ten beautiful
medals. Two of these were won
by Pete Ashcraft in the one mile
and two mile runs. The remark-
able thing here is that Ashcraft
has not run this distance in con-
‘secutive laps since cross-country
season. With a third place under
their belts, the boys were satisfied
and looking forward to another
outdoor season.

As I have said before, it seems
that the Kappa Sigs are the team
to beat in the fraternity basket-
ball tourney. They overpowered
the Sigma Chis handily last Tues-
day night to gain undisputed pos-
session of first place. However,
the Pi Kapps almost upset the
apple cart Wednesday night with
the Kappa Sigs winning by a two-
point margin.

Last week I was fortunate enough to travel with the in-

year of graduate study were won
by Davidson men. In addition,
there have been three Rhodes
scholarships, three Danforth
scholarship and six Morehead
scholarships awarded to Davidson
students in the last few years.

The prospects for receiving a
scholarship are brighter today than
ever before. First, because there
are more scholarships offered and
also because many student go
from college directly into the
Army.

Also, there is an interesting new
feature in the way of graduate
scholarships. This is the offering
of interdisciplinary studies, which
consists of studying several fields
related to your major rather than
specalizing in one field. For in-
stance, taking work in the social
sciences and humanities as a whole
rather than just history or
sociology alone. Pomina and Stan-
ford offer this type of program.

Northwestern, Columbia, ana
Pennsylvania have introduced area
studies. Here history, political
science, economics and_ related
fields are combined to help in the
understanding of whole areas like
Southeastern Asia, Africa, Japan,
Eastern Europe, or the Middle
East. ;

In addition to the usual fields
the committee is interested in see-
ing students apply for scholarships
in less crowded fields such as
political science, public adminis-
tration, social work, group work,
and high school teaching. They
feel that if Davidson, as the lead-
ing men’s college in the South, is
to fulfill its obligation to supply
the South with well-qualified men
in al areas of experience and de-
velopment that it must also begin
to produce men to serve in these
areas,

If you are interested in graduate
work, there are many possibilities
open for scholarships. The im-
portant thing is to begin preparing
for these very early in your col-
college career,

time undergraduate student regis-
tered in a college, university, or
junior college in the United States
or Canada for any term of the
school year 1954-55. No student
who has written professionally is
eligible.

General theme of the contest is
“Drinking in College.” Editorials
may deal with any phase of the
theme and each writer shall select
his own title.

Maximum length of each edi-
torial is 800 words and the mini-
mum length is 500 words.

Manuscript must be typewritten
(double spaced) or written in ink.

blank must accompany each entry.

Deadline is May 1, 1955. To be
considered, an editorial must not
be postmarked later than this date.

Judging will be based on sound-
ness and originality of thought,
quality of research, clarity of ex-
pression, and accuracy of basic
facts.

Library Adds Latest
Popular Best Sellers

The Davidson College Library
has recently acquired five new
books, including the top three fic-
tion books in the country aggord-
ing to the New York Herald
Tribune of January 30. The other
two additions are Good Morning,
Miss Dove, rated sixth by the
Tribune, and a non-fiction book,
The Ssturdsy Evening Post
Treasury.

View from Pompey’s Head

Hamilton Basso’s View from
Pompey’s Head, rated first in the
fiction books of the nation, is the
story of a New York: lawyer who
returns to his birthplace in the
South, Pompey’s Head, for the pur-
pose of investigating a literary
claim. The book compares the
social distinctions of the small
Southern town with the questions
of reputation and standing in New
York literary circles.

Love fs Sternel

Rated second is Irving Stone's
Love Is Eternal, a warm and stir-
ring novel which deals with Mary
Todd and Abraham Lincoln up
to the time of Lincoln's assassina-
tion. The author takes certain
liberties with history in trying to
persuade the reader to accept Mary
Todd as the one who lifted Lincoln
to success.

No Time for Sergeants

Mac Hyman’s No Time fer Ser-
geants is rated third. It is a light
and hamorous story of Will Stock-
dale, who is inducted into the
army and tries to help everybody—
even the sergeants. But his
methods only get him into trouble.
