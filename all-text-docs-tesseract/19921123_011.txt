In Black andWhite...
The Court: Equal Opportunity?

We'd like to start off by say-
ing that we’re glad Bill Clinton got
elected. Even though we have
reservations about him, at least mi-
nority issues won’t be totally ig-
* nored like they have been during
the past twelve years (touché, Bill
Gullan).

This week’s article has noth-
ing to do with Bills (Clinton or
Gullan). Our once again theoreti-
cal conversation deals with the
awkwardness—even
the isolation—felt by

the fact remains that you don’t see
a lot of them on the Court—one of
the main social outlets at
Davidson—because they don’t
enjoy it.

Scott: Why not?

Deidra: Well, I guess you could
say that it has to do with upbring-
ing—or rather what you’ re used to
from home. When I’m at home,
my social activities are completeley
different. If I go to a party, there’s

group that’s performing. If you’ve
never heard of the group why would
you pay to see them? (This is not
to say the Union is not trying its

. besttorepresentall of the different

groups on campus, it’s just a fact
that when there is a majority view
on something—whether it beacon-
cert or a movie—the others who
don’t agree are left with their opin-

ion.)
I admit that the speakers that
have come recently

many African-Ameri-
can students at
Davidson.

Scott: Why do so
many African-Ameri- ~
can students disappear
on the weekends? I
rarely see them on the
Court or at concerts.
Deidra: A lot of the
social activities at
Davidson do not ap-
peal to the African-
American students.
You don’t see many
of them on the Court,
because they don’t

have been good, and
for this I send a shout
out to the Union
board and all other
committees involved
in bringing - them.
However, a speaker
here and there. does
not make a social life.

There really is
Not a social outlet to
which the African-
American students
belong. Many begin
to feel isolated. This
‘isa big reason why at
least two African-
American students

often enjoy the music

per year transfer from

at parties, the exces-
sive drinking, or the
atmosphere as a whole: they usu-
ally go to a party to dance or hang
out with friends. Since those kinds
of parties are rarely here, they go
. Out of town.

Scott: Surely you’re not suggest-
ing that all African-American stu-
dents like the same kind of music;
that there aren’t different types of
music for different races.

Deidra: This is not what I’m try-
ing to say. There are different
types of African-Americans who
like different types of music, but

usually dance music playing and
everybody’s hanging out talking
to friends or on the dance floor.

The. parties at Davidson are
not the same. A lot of times you’ll
find me on the Court running
around with my friends, but if I
want a party like the ones I go to at
home, I go out of town.

Let’s also. take for example
the concert groups that coine to
Davidson; nine times out of ten,
many of the African-American stu-
dents haven’t even heard of the

Davidson. They feel
like they don’tbelong
to this school. When they look
back on their college years they
don’t want to remember the exams

or all-nighters (granted, if hard.

work isn’t learned here it ain’t
learned), but good times, great par-
ties, and most of all friends. I
honestly don’t think some of the
African-American students will
remember Davidson for the great
times.

The Ever Different Column Title...
Thanksgiving, F-Ball, and Grandpa

On Thursday, many of us will
be going home to celebrate the
traditional Thanksgiving with fam-
ily and friends much like the Pil-
grims and Indians did a four hun-
. dred years ago:

JOHN SMITH: Could you

pass the corn bread please?

SQUANTO: Yes, John Smith.

JOHN SMITH: Thank you.
Can you please pass the turkey?

SQUANTO: Yes, John Smith,

~ would you care for the lumpy po-
tatoes?

Howis the turkey John Smith?

JOHN SMITH: Uh, it’s
very...uh... WHAT?!!_ NO: PASS
INTERFERENCE?!!

He wasallover the guy! Man,
Squanto, you gotta agree with me;
he
was hit way before the ball even
got there.

Thanksgiving Day Football
has given the opportunity for fami-
lies all across America to get to-
gether and huddle around a 20’
television set, discusscommercials,
talk ‘about their lives, watch an
exciting match up between the
Detroit Lions and the Greenbay

Packers and listen to Grandpa Ed’s
unforgettable Thanksgiving day
football story about the time HE
was sitting in the stands when the

Tony Tunasit

Lion’s Len Dawson threw that
game winning touchdown pass and
Grandpa suddenly realized that his
~nose was FALLING OFF because
it-was the COLDEST DAY IN

RECORDED. HISTORY and the
guy next to him tumed into an
LIVING SNOWMAN and people
couldn’t even hear the person next
to them because THE WORDS
FROZE -OVER BEFORE ANY-
ONE COULD HEAR THEM and
BIG WOOLY MAMMOTHS
roamed the fifty yard’ line and
Grandpa had to spend Thanksgiv-
ing with a big nurse named BER-
THA.

Thanksgiving Day Football
actually originated some three hun-
dred years ago when Faith Brown
asked her dear husband Samuel
Browntohelpher baste the Thanks-
giving turkey and Samuel, search-
ing for any reasonable excuse be-
cause he was a firm non-baster
replied,‘‘Uh, honey, uh, I can’t be-
cause there's this football game
between Detroit and Greenbay!”
Faith believed him.

Men all around quickly

' picked up on this excuse and thus,

over the years, while the women
have toiled in the kitchen perfect-
ing the turkey withcranberry sauce,

Idle pondering of the prob-
lems associated with our gen-
eration (ie. drug abuse, depres-
sion, apathy, etc.) hed led me to
the conclusion that our parents
have failed us. Do not take this
assertion the wrong way.-I-do
not intend to condemn the
parenting skills of those who send
their children to Davidson. The
generation to which they belong,
however—The Baby Boom—
has blundered miserably. Their

grander shortcoming of our par-

heroes and a corresponding fail-
ure to instill in us a romantic
view of the infinity of our poten-

in the process of trying to solve the
civil rights problems.” Several
months later, he added that “‘the
new civil rights act was passed to

protect 14% of the people. I am’

also worried about the other 86%.”

Diane Mosbacher, whose fa-
ther and brother are chief GOP
fund-raisers and Bush campaign-
ers in Texas, calls the GOP stand
on lesbians and gays “neither ex-
pedient nor ethical.” Ms.
Mosbacher is one of many tar-
geted by the “cultural war” de-
clared by Pat Buchanan at the Re-
publican Convention.

At that convention, placards
read “Family rights forever, Gay
rightsnever.” Mosbacher declared,
“When you have the President of
the United States and Vice Presi-
dent standing up and making
homophobic remarks it goes be-
yond just denying us our basic
human rights.”

Pat Robertson lead the: tax-
exempt Christian Coalition in rais-
ing over $13 million in their at-
temptto support “pro-family Chris-
tians and achieving working con-

trol of the Republican Party in 1996.
The Christian Coalition actively
lobbied against the gay rights ini-
tiatives in Oregon and Colorado as
well as working to defeat an equal
rights amendment in Iowa that
Robertson déscribed asa “feminist
agenda...that encourages women .
to leave their husbands, kill their
children, practice witchcraft, de-
stroy capitalism, and become les-
bians.” So when do we start bum-
ing these witches?

Last week, Governor Fortice
stated, “The less we emphasize the
Christian religion the further we
fall into the abyss of the poor char-
acter and chaos in the United States
of America.” This is the same
governor who said that he would
call the National Guard to fight
any court-ordered tax increase
funding at Mississippi’s nearly

‘segregated universities and angered

environmentalists by calling the
“tree-huggers”. As the GOP falls
further out of the mainstream their
support falls, also.
