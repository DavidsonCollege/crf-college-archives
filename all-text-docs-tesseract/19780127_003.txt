The Davidsonian

Advisory Councils: First in a series

Trustees defined

By HELEN WHITE
Staff Writer

Misconceptions among stu-
dents prompted Assistant to
the President Gary Barnes to
lead an open. end discussion
Tuesday about thenature and
function of the trustees.

The trustees have ‘‘com-

plete ownership, management
and control of the College’’
according to Davidson’s con-
stitution. Barnes explained
that the 46 non-paid members
are the highest authorities in
the campus hierachy. The
President of the College serves
as a consultant to this group.

Finance committee oversees budget

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer

In spite of a prevailing sense
of unity and cooperation, se-
veral members of the Finance,
Personnel and Development
Council, an advisory commit-
tee of the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA), feel
the Council is hindered by its
poorly defined purpose.

The Constitution of David-
son College states that the
Council “is consulted by the
President...at stages which
permit 6rderly consideration
of the Council’s advice prior to
the final formulation of the
budget.’’ (Article IV, Para-
graph 2.)

Council Secretary Lauren
W. Yoder noted that the
committee has been ‘‘pres-
sured for time in implementing
the budget process’’ and has
not been able to define its
goals. Yoder further noted
that the other primary aspects
of the committee’s concern,
personnel and fund raising
(development), had been al-

Scholarship seeks

By LYNN PEACE
Staff Writer

Leaders of the Stuart Scho-
larship Program and current
Stuart Scholars met at David-
son last weekend to organize
selection committees and dis-
cuss final plans for the Febru-
ary 18 District interviews.

The Program Directors, on
the basis of applications, have
narrowed the field of about 400
candidates to 64 semi-final-
ists. Following District Inter-
views, the regions will invite a
total of 16 to final interviews
at Davidson March 14—15.

The four scholarship win-
ners will be announced around
April 1.

Four full scholarships, re-
newable each year, are being
offered. Last year, the first
year of the program, the
Stuart Foundation gave two
$2,000 and seven $500 awards.

The change, explained Pro-
gram Director Seddon Goode,
is due to the appeal of more

contpetic:ys séhobarships in .

most completely neglected.

SGA President Thom,
Young echoed Yoder’s con-
cern. ‘‘I wonder if our scope is
too big. Maybe there should
be a separate finance commit-
tee.”

Young added that a body
should exist to deal- with the
personnel and development
areas, especially if the budget
recommendations require
longer to formulate in the
future.

Professor of Sociology Ro-
bert Ruth, the committee
chairman, could not be
reached for comment.

The group consists of six
teaching members of the facul-
ty appointed by Spencer, three
students se'ected by the Se-
nate each Spring, as well as
several ex officio officers.
Serving presently are Ruth,
Yoder, Professor of Mathema-
tics Benjamin Klein, Professor
of History Malcolm Lester,
Professor of Economics Glenn

Lindsey and Professor of Ger-
man Thomas Pinkerton. The

The Foundation extended
the Program to Virginia,
South Carolina, Tennesse, and
Alabama this year. North
Carolina and Florida were the
sole participants in 1977.

In 1976, friends and class-
mated of alumnus Ed Stuart
set up the program in his
memory with the purpose of
attracting strong Christian
leaders to Davidson.

The scholarship is based
solely upon merit. The appli-
cation stresses four criteria:
Christian character, leader-
ship, scholastic achievement,
and ‘‘vigorous outlook.’

A student may not apply for
the scholarship. He must be
recommended by an alumni
chapter or by his principal.

Scholars, once at Davidson,
are expected to ‘‘keep up their
scholastic ratings’’ and ‘‘to
bring honor to themselves and
honor to the school,’’ said
Goods, : ;

i
. students are Jim Kuster,

Bruce Lantelme, and Thom
Young.

Young noted the main acti-
vity of the Council is an
“awareness of faculty needs
and student needs in the
budget making process.

“This year’s recommenda-
tion to College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer, Jr. included
funds for cost of living in-
creases for faculty salaries,
lighting of tennis courts, fa-
culty research, and library
expansion, in terms of both
periodicals and books. The.
SGA President described the
latter as ‘‘a great selling point
for the school.”

Yoder pointed out that an
open meeting was held for the
first time in the Fall to
augment faculty—student in- |
put for their recommenda-
tions.

A particular area of concern
was the large increases in book
prices and periodical rates
within the last year. Many
reiterated Young’s view that
the library budget must not

Director of Admissions H.
Edmunds White sees three
primary values in the Stuart
Scholarships for Davidson: 1.
It will enroll four ‘‘truly
exceptional’ students, 2. E-
ven though a candidate may
not be selected for the scholar-
ship, interest in Davidson may
be stimulated during the ap-
plication process. 3. ‘‘Alumni
involved in the program will
learn a lot more about current
Davidson.”

fall behind the yearly rate o!
inflation, which would ulti-
mately reduce its quality.

Both Young and Yoder cited
the tone of cooperation within
the committee itself, though
Yoder stated that some facul-
ty members outside the body
are “leery over increased allo-
cation of funds for athletics.”

Opinions of the professors
are solicited each Fall for
incorporation into the Coun-
cil’s recommendations. After
the Council reviews its find-
ings in November and Decem-
ber, the suggested findings are
sent to Spencer for considera-
tion.

If Spencer rejects the re-
commendations, he is required
to inform the Trustees of the
decision and of the findings in
what Young sees as an impor-
tant check on the school
administrations

Preliminary reports on the
budget will be completed with-
in the next two weeks, and the
final draft will be considered
by the Trustees in mid—Feb-
ruary.

The majority of the Trust-
ees are elected by the Presby-
teries of North Carolina and
Flgrida. Other members are
chosen by the Trustees them-
selves on the basis of merit
contribution to the College.

All members serve four year
terms and most can be re-
elected for three successive
terms befors having to relin-
quish their positions. A one
year period of inactivity is
necessary before the candidate
is again eligible to serve.

Barnes said that within the
body of Trustees the most
powerful group is the execu-
tive committee made up of
chairman, vice-chairman and
secratary (all one year posts,
renewable indefinitely).

Although the Trustees as a
whole convene only three
times a year, the executive
committee meets at least twice
as often and may declare
policy decisions by which all
Trustees are bound, without
general consent of the board.

The present group of Trust-
ees, like the student body, is
mostly from the South, and
ranges in age from 40 to 65,
Barnes pointed out. Although
no one profession dominates
the group—the ministry, bus-
iness and education are all
represented—all but two
members are male.

The Trustees will be on
campus February 16 and 17.
Barnes said that there will be
several opportunities for stu-
dent input—at receptions,
dinners or through Student
Government President Thom
Young, who is given the
opportunity to voice opinions
at each of the three annual
meetings.

He added that students may
at all times contact Trustees’
by letter or through him if
they have any further ques-
tions.
