The Harlem
Globetrotters

In the midst of March Mad-
ness, a reminder that basketball
can be enjoyed as entertainment
without cutthroat competition
pleases and even surprises us. Last
Sunday, March 19, the Harlem
Globetrotters performed in the
LJVM Coliseum in Winston-Sa-
lem. None of us had seen them
before, save for that episode of
Scooby-Doo, but we knew the
music and, before the evening was
over, we knew “Sweet Lou.”

“Sweet Lou” Dunbar is the
reigning “Clown Prince of Bas-
ketball,” and this season kicks off
his farewell tour with the
Globetrotters. Following in the
footsteps of Reese “Goose”
Tatum, the original “Clown
Prince,’ Dunbar was pursued by
many professional teams includ-
ing the- Houston Rockets (he
played for their summer pro
league), but being a natural come-
dian and asupporter of the family,
he chose to pursue a career with
the Globetrotters.

“I was young and ready to
play,” Dunbar says, “and the
Harlem Globetrotters provided an
excellent opportunity. Friends
whoreally know me say it was my

drug and alcohol problems. He
also loves spending time with his
wife, playing golf, and collecting
cars.

He says, “I know that I play
for a special team and I recognize
what the audience wants to see.
Seeing all those smiling faces
makes me want to go out and have
fun every night.”

And that is just what “Sweet
Lou” does. The Globetrotters tour
the world, and have entertained
more than ten million people on
six continents. They possibly could
be the most winning basketball
team in history, having come out
victorious in more than 3,400 con-
secutive games.

What did the audience think
of the performance? One young
girl said, “I wish they had taken

~ me out [on the court]. I would
have been too embarrassed,
though. They did embarrass some
of the kids, but it was all fun.” Her
mother added, “The kids love it,
and that’s what it’s all about.”

We agree. Maybe it was just
the beer and the nachos, but after
the Globetrotters left the court,
none of us could keep from smil-
ing. We had been reminded of
our youth — of a time when a
game was a game and basketball
nets were unreachable. The
Globetrotters are for the children,

calling because I’ve always been ° still

the practical joker in the group.”

Golf team finding
stroke mid-season

By JoHN RoE
Sports writer

The men’s golf team is half-
way through the season and seems
to be finding its stroke.

Despite a makeshift lineup,
the squad has played fairly well in
three competitions this spring. The
golfers placed 14th in the Charles-
ton Southern Invitational, eighth
in The Citadel Invitational and,
lead by Chris Dana’s third place
finish, the Wildcats took third ina
match last Thursday.

“The team is working hard to
improve,” said coach Joseph Mark.

Their next match, the Lonnie.

D. Small Invitational, comes April
2-4 at Campbell in Blues Creek,
N.C.

“In this weekend’s tourna-
ment, there will be a very strong

field,’ Mark said. “This tourna-
ment will be an excellent warm-up
forthe (Southern) Cdnference tour-
nament.”

The teams’ top four golfers
are Jason Carlock, Andy McDaniel,
Jason Lina and Danny Tedrick.
The fifth spot ig a toss up between
captain Kevin Miller and Aubrey
Proud. The team’s goal is to shoot
a 300, which means that the top
four scorers would have to average
a 75.

Davidson’s best score so far
this season is a 309, but if the
golfers could knock nine shots off
that mark, it could make for a suc-
cessful conference tournament.

That tournament will be hosted
by Georgia Southern at Forest
Heights Country Club in
Statesboro, Ga., on April 10th and
11th.

more, and the kids I coach now are
a lot more acceptable."

Born in Pittsburgh and having
grown up in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
Frank started coaching in his se-
nior year in high school when he
coached the freshmen, who had a
separate team because they weren't
allowed to play on the varsity team.

He graduated from Davidson
in 1966 and went on to get a law
degree from the University of
Florida, where he did some coach-
ing for the varsity team there for 3
1/2 years.

After that he coached tennis at
a prep school in Atlanta for three
years. When he was asked to come
back to Davidson and coach the
Wildcats, he jumped at the chance.

When asked whether or not he
would keep coaching for a while,
Frank said he intends to say on as
the coach for at least another nine
years. Afterwards, he would like
to do some travelling and some
writing as well,

His advice for anyone consid-
ering being a tennis coach? "Find
another profession! The NCAA —
puts a tremendous amount of pa-
perwork on us, and its very diffi-
cult if you have a family. I advise
anyone to think carefully first."

Globetrotters?

I doubt it, baby.

"Sweet Lou” Dunbar

What is the one thing you have enjoyed most about the

The kids. When the kids come, you never know if it’s their first time.
You put a smile on their faces, and I think that’s very important today.
What are you going to be doing after this season?

I will still be involved for another year, playing on the West coast. I
might come back as a coach; I don’t know yet.

Are you going to come back like Michael Jordan?
