Body Chooses
Seni or Blazer

Ballots Reveal Tan Camel’s

Hair Is Choice
Chairman Terrell Porter of the
senior blazer committee made it

known in an interview last Satur-
day evening that a decision has
been reached as to the blazer to
be ordered.

It is to be a tan camel's hair
coat, three-button, single breasted,
an extreme drape with a plain
back. The results of the balloting
revealed that approximately nine-
tenths ‘of those desiring blazers
wished no “D” or numeral on the
jacket.

Several meetings were held at
various times to vote on the blaz-
ers. There were only a small num-
ber present at the meeting Moday
night, October 31, but better at-
tendance was noted at another
meeting November 3. So far about
forty have signed up for blazers,
but it is hoped that at least fifty
will get them in the end. At the
meeting last Thursday night some
objections were raised to the price,
$15.00, but it was pointed out that
according to the voting the major-
ity was in favor of the camel’s hair
coat,

Johnny Spratt, representative

ing measurements. These have now
been finished, and the blazers are
expected within the next few
weeks.

Student Body

DownsMotion

Proposed Motion Is Defeated
By Vote Of 204 to 139

“Resolved, That any body which
will act as a committee or other
representative unit of the  stu-
dent body shall report all its
plans and activities to the stu-
dent body for approval and informa-
tion of the latter.”

The motion was defeated by a
count of 204 to 139, The students
voted in a secret ballot during this
same assembly. A simple majority
was all that was required to de-
feat the measure.

Presented By Torrey

The resolution, presented in the
form of a motion, was drawn up
by Archer Torrey and seconded by
Wallace Sherer, Dan Walker, and
Bill Diehl. It was sent by mail to
Fred Stair, president of the stu-
dent body, who read it at the as-
sembly.

Torrey explained that the pur-
pose of the motion was to find out
the activities of the various groups
representing the student body. This
he stated would do away with the

misunderstanding which ogeurs so

often between the students and
these various organizations.
Motion Discussed

In the discusion that followed
Ned Iverson asked that the motion
be more fully explained and_ its
purpose be »made clearer. Sam
Spencer stated that in its present
form he believed that it would

only serve to slow down the ma-
chinery of the organization. Wal-
lace Scherer, speaking for the mo-
tion, stated that every student
body should know the activities of
its representatives.

This was the first motion to be
brought before the student body

Director Shepherd also gave the
plans of the Athletic Department to
permit the students to designate
two home games each year in the
future as those at which they might
purchase girls’ tickets.

He explained that the idea of girls’
tickets in the beginning was to

soon become a sort of tradition to
have girls’ tickets at each game.

Friends and Graduates

By DR. W. L. LINGLE

There is a very beautiful thought

enshrined in the phrase. “Home-
coming.” It contains the intimation
that when once a student attends

a college, the college is forever aft-
erwards his home. That is just as it
should be, In after-years, as one
looks back at his four years in col-
lege, they are among the very hap-
piest years of his life. At any rate,
there is something about the memo-
ry of those years that make them
different from all other years. They
were’ the years in which the stu-
dent grew from boyhood into man-
hood. Not only so, but the years in

which he made his finest friend-
ships.
It is not necesary to say that

there will be a warm welcome for
all former students who come back
to the old College on Homecoming
Day. That goes without saying. It
