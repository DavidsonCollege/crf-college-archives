Science for the Layman

Education merits progress. In recog-
nition of the general trend in education
and the needs of Davidsgn in particular
the following proposal is presented for

criticism, consideration, and possible
action. .

According to the present system, a
student in order to graduate must pass
one course in the field of science, chosen
from either chemistry, biology, or physics.
The implied purpose behind such require-
ments is that a liberal arts graduate would
not have a complete education without a
year’s exposure to the mysteries of
science. It has been felt by many that this
worthy purpose is not fulfilled nor cur-
rent needs met by the present system.
Would not a general science course afford
the solution?

Such a course would initiate two fields
of instruction. Science majors would enter
an accelerated course in their respectivé
fields and the remainder of the student
body would be offered a course in general
science. This course would present all
three sciences, with emphasis upon
modern times, and developed around
understanding and application of the
scientific method. It would be flexible
enough to include recent éxperimentation
and discoveries such as the Salk vaccine,
atomic power, and the H-bomb without
utilizing front page headlines for a text.

There are many reasons to support a
general science course. As it now stands,
the present courses, especially in physics
and chemistry, are geared too low for
science majors and too high for the lay-
man. According to first semester figures
(Davidsonian, Oct. 15, 1954), only 25% of
the 640 expressing professional interests
are pre-med. Allowing some 5% for math
and associated majors, that leaves around
10% (pre-law, pre-business, pre-min, etc.)
who are required to absorb fairly tech-
nical instruction. There is then a need for
more advanced individual courses and a
generalized presentation for the layman.

On the basis of a test given around
five years ago at Davidson to seniors and
sophomores, it was found that Biology
boys knew little if anything about Physics
and Chemistry, and students of the latter
were equally embarrassed in the other
sciences. There is then a need for breadth
of scientific instruction.

Many reasons for this course are found
in the benefits which it could bring to
our curriculum. It would present an in-
formative and practical knowledge of all
three sciences to the student who is not
interested or does not have sufficient time
to major in an individual science. It would
further offer to science majors comp?e-
hensive preparatory courses in their field,
presenting more technical knowledge and
concentrated laboratory . requirements
which would provide an invaluable founda-
tion for later work.

Further, the scientific method, per-
haps the crux of this course, could be bet-
ter presented and practically analyzed.

The trend in education is toward
general liberal arts training, not specific
and detailed lectures which by their very
required nature limit discussion and
scope. Specalization is not encouraged in
most fields until graduate level today.

A course of general science could be-
come: a reality. Text books have been
written, and such schools as Michigan
State and FSU among others, have suc-
cessfully employed this type of instruc-
tion in their curriculum.

Such a course need not develop into
a crip by any means. It would present a
challenge to both student and professor
and depend upon the interest and de-
termination of both. It could be flexible
without being flippant or attached to the
trivial.

Davidson need not wait until the last
hour before it presents a modern,
practical, and interesting course of in-
struction in general science. May educa-
‘tion not be denied the benefits of progres-
sive presentation.

Farewell To Arms-An Evaluation

At the beginning of the present
school year, a unique program
came into existence in the Cadet
Corps at Davidson College. A far-
sighted staff of military science
instructors looked 58 senior cadets
over closely and handed the opera-
tion of the cadet regiment entirely
over to them with the exception of
classroom instruction. ‘Twas a
shock to be sure . .. No more
would cadets be told how each and
every phase of ROTC activities was
to be conducted. There was no
doubt about it—it was a sink or
swim proposition. It was meant to
be so. Next came the inevitable
cynical remarks which characterize
the Davidson scene, to the effect
that the “new look” in the ROTC
Dept. wouldn't last six weeks. Well,
it did last . . . And most observers
have agreed that it has grown into
something which may produce
some of the best qualified officers
which the Army Reserve has ever
received from Davidson College. It
is well worth while analyzing the
reasons for the survival and ap-
parent success of the new system
of operation.

From the heginning, all men in
ROTC pitched in and attempted
to show that the cadets were capa-
ble of running their own corps.
Sure, there were problems, but per-
haps problems are a sign of a
growing organism. On Tuesday aft-

Are We Lagging ?

By CORTEZ A, COOPER

ernoons, more and more David-
sonians reported to drill with brass
a little bit sharper and shoes which
showed evidences of much polish-
ing. To the senior cadets, this was
a good sign... esprit de corps, a
pride in the cadet corps which had
long been dormant..

A man does his best work and
expends most energy when he has
a personal interest in what success
in a task will mean. This was the
case in the cadet corps this year.
if we have succeeded the credit be-
longs to us... If we have failed,
then the stigma belongs to us. And
I am prepared to say to anyone
that the men, who earned through
hard work and a lot of preparation
the finest rating which can be
awarded in the annual Spring In-
spection, made a smashing success!
Davidson has every right to be
proud of its having such outstand-
ing and far-sighted men as Lt, Col.
Sapp, our PMS&T, and his entire
staff of officers and non-coms as
the guides of a system such as the
present one. Theirs hasn’t been
an easy year... Supervision and
advice often require more effort
and sincere application than going
on and doing a task yourself.

These comments are not in-
tended to present a rose-colored
picture of all that has taken place
in the military scene at Davidson.
Basic and Sophomore cadets should

Liberal Arts And

To evaluate objectively the edu-
cational program of any school js
almost an impossible task, much
less one which we love as much
as Davidson. It would not be dif-
ficult to write countless articles
enumerating the excellent aca-
demic standards of our alma mater
of which we are justly proud, but
we believe that constructive
criticism has a better chance of in;
inducing action than deserved
praise; this seems like an -appro-
priate time to say we believe the
quality of our curriculum in some
areas is not on a par with our
splendid faculty and high calibre
of our educational program.

HUMANITIES

The major failing in our curri-
culum is the lack of a broad course
in the humanities which a tour
through the catalogues in the
registrar's office will reveal almost
all colleges and universities offer
if not require. ; Of course it is
dangerous to judge the academic
program of any school by simply
comparing courses offered, but we
feel that there is much of positive
value from such a study. It would
be impossible naturally to have a
course in the great ideas and per-
sonalities of history as at Prince-
ton, Harvard, and Yale where stu-
dents for the most part really take
education seriously, but we could
have a four semester Cultural Heri-
tage course as Bates (846 students:
Lewiston, Maine) offers. Their
course, as does a similar one at
Haverford and eight-semester one
at Coker, at least famitlarizes the
students extensively if not inten-
sively with the great thinkers from

By GILBERT GRAGG

"Homer, Sophocles, Plato, Augus-

tine, Virgil, Aquinas, Dante, Ma-
chiavelli, Rousseau, Hegel, Dos-
tolevski, Freud, Marx, and Mann.
Admittedly such a course would
have to be on a superficial level
and be under the joint leadership
of several departments, but it
would open up whole new areas
of learning for those who cannot
major in English, Philosophy, His-
tory, and Economics at one time.

Why could not Davidson fresh-
men be given placement tests in
English as they are in Math and
the top scorers be allowed to graze
in greener pastures? Certainly
many prep school graduates find
Freshmen English on a very low
level and would profit much more
by a course such as Presbyterian
offers—Readings in World Litera-
ture; in some schools this course
is offered as an alternative to
British Literature, which is very
limited in scope. Many schools are
beginning to offer a type of hu-
manities course to freshmen called
Philosophy Through Literature
which would be of inestimable
value.

RELIGION AND BIBLE

Although sex is still first in most
Davidson bull sessions, religion
runs a close second. Everyone is
an amateur theologian, and col-
lege should be the place of re-
thinking the faith which was
handed down to us—this means
studying religion in general as
well as the Hebrew-Christian Scrip-
tures. instead of tossing fresnmen
right Into the Garden of Eden
with ite fertile soll for cynicism,
why not have an opening semester

receive more than 1% hours of
credit per semester for ROTC, and
efforts are being made to take up
this matter with the trustees, And
I feel confident that any needed
adjustments in cadet administra-
tion of the program can be brought
about by recommendations from
students as well as from instruc.
tors. Sure, there has heen loose
motion in the cogs that turn the
wheel of the ROTC, but learning
from these mistakes will lead to
greater success in the future.

All in all, even in the face of
tender young critics who have
taken it upon themselves to cru-
sade heartily (and loudly) against
anything or anyone who wears a
uniform signifying service in the
armed forces, ROTC at Davidson
has had a good year. And credit
for this goes directly to the stu-
dents who have seen a task and
performed it well... the cadet
private on up through the cadet
officers. Possessing no sage-like
wisdom to throw out, I would
simply say to those who are to
move up a notch in the military
next year that if being “GUNG HO"
entails working hard at preparing
yourself to do your part in the
defense of all that you believe in,
then it is my fervent hope that you
will be just as “GUNG HO” as you
possibly can!

Davidson

on the history and psychology of
religious development as proper
background for spending a semes-
ter on Hebrew History and then
® semester on New Testament?
The fourth semester could well be
spent studying Classics of Religious
Thought (Pascal, Eckhardt, Wool-
man, ete.) as at Haverford or, hav-
ing a semester as Agnes Scott does
to study History of Christian Doc-
trine. Even staunchly Baptist Fur-
man requires more courses in Re-
ligion than Bible without neces-
sarily minimizing the significance
of the scriptures.

Davidson is admittedly a fine
liberal arts school, but it is out
of step in these ways with the
best small Nberal arts schools in
the country. Any student wishing
an humbling intellectual experience
should listen to the College Quiz
Bowl (WIST) in which selected
schools send student teams to
match minds, and then think twice
before he says Davidson is the
best school in the South (both
Washington and Lee and Duke have
been recent guest schools) again.

Four years at Davidson is a chal-
tenging, exciting, disappointing,
thdughtful, and joyous experience
from an academic standpoint, and
we covet for future Devidgoniens
an even higher quality of courses
—only when students have been
exposed fo all areas of learning
will our already excellent college
cause its students to realize that
the laborious and often painful
fourney up the steep mountain of
understanding is Infinitely worth.
while and eternsity rewarding.

For a Better Davidson:

Sweeping Curriculum
Changes Necessary

By JOHN REED

Davidson is a swell school. Just
ask anyone who doesn’t go here.
But the belief in the Great David-
son Myth that has so seduced most
of the outside world is not nearly
so compelling to those of us here.
Not all in the Davidson community
are so sure that Davidson is the
best of all possible educational
worlds. In fact, often something
very like this takes place in lieu
of the educational experience that
a college supposedly provides: A
man comes to Davidson, in most
eases eager to learn and anticipat-
ing a great experience, and is im-
mediately confronted with numer.
ous courses of questionable value
which are often taught at the high
school level by bored professors;
he feels that the terrible pressure
for conformity in the matter of
disdain for the intellect and de-
sirability of the social life.

Consequently, he goes through a
period of resistance to the system
and then finally succumbs super-
ficially or in fact and becomes
another impotent glob in the ag-
glutination of nothings that com-
prise Davidson. Finally, when he
receives his diploma and looks to
see what he has acquired over his
four years, all he can find is a
slightly polished personality, the
prospect of a good job afforded
him by the reputation of the di-
ploma he carries, and a few mis-
cellaneous facts that he learned
during an examination period that
his mind has not yet been able
to expel. His mind is the same
sluggish hunk of nervous tissue
that, it has always been, not having
been exerted much since the mas-
tery of long division.

What can be done about this
situation? What changes must be
made before Davidson can begin
to train minds which will be capa-
ble of coping with the problems of
modern society, minds which can-
not only adapt themselves to their
environment but also can change
environment for the good of all
men. It seems to me that there
are many steps which could be
taken. Here are a few of them:

1. Require the College Board
Examinations of ali applying stu-
dents and make it a determining
factor in the selection of the fresh-
man class. This would serve the
double purpose of attracting more
applications from the brighter
students and discouraging those
with less ability from applying.
Such a procedure would raise the
level of collective intellectual ca-
pacity immeasurably.

2. At least 76% of the courses
at Davidson should be conducted
on a higher, more mature level.
There should be more parallel
work in the library and fewer
class lectures, leaving more time
for discussion and questioning. To
make such improvements in the
quality of courses would require a
much greater effort than is exerted
now on both the part of the stu-
dent and the professor.

3. The faculty should be en-.

larged by the addition of young,

By Popular Demand:

naive teachers whose enthusiasm
has not yet been deflated by un-
appreciative students. The depart-
ments of psychology, physics,
sociology, and philosophy are great-
ly lacking in manpower.

4. There should be a radical
change in the courses required for
graduation. Some of the changes
needed are as follows:

Bible—Two full years of work
in the Old and New Testaments is a
waste of'time when one considers
the courses which must be omitted
in order to take Bible. A compre-
hensive, one-year course in com-

parative religion with special atten- .

tion to Christianity and the Bible
should be substituted. The student
should be exposed to the nature
and philosophy of religion and to
the doctrines found in the more
important faiths, and then allowed
to accept or reject as his reason
guides him, The professor should
describe; the student should aval-
uate.

oSelence — Non-science majors
should not be required to take a
pure sciegce course. In its place a
two-semester course would be
substituted in the “Tactics and
Strategy of Science,” as J. B. Co-
nant puts it, designed to introduce
the student to the purposes and
methods of scientific inquiry. Ex-
amples would be drawa from classi-
cal and contemporary chemistry,
biology and physics. This change
is one of the most needed at David-
son, where the rift between science
and ‘religion constantly widens; it
would do away with much of the
misunderstanding between scien-
tists and non-scientists. A man can
hardly appreciate science if his
only exposure to it has been in
drawing a drupe fruit or an arche-
gonium.

With the current increase in the
population of prospective college
students threatening. to modify
every standing educationel pattern,
it seems to me that Davidson is
going to have to make a very
crucial decision in the near future.
Is Davidson to continue to train
personalities only and provide
southern society with men who are
pillars of their communities, who
live reputable, middle-class
lives devoted to the preservation
of the status quo? Or is Davidson
to make an about face and begin
to train minds as well as person.
alities and to graduate men who
are capable of improving the status
quo, of creating as well as main-
taining. In the men standing at
the frontiers of knowledge in all
fields we see the hope of the
modern’ world—does Davidson
want to produce some of these
men? If we choose the first alter.
native, we must give up our reputa-
tion as a first rate institution of
learning and accept the equally
worthy reputation as a polishing
factory for reputable, middle-class
citizens. On the other hand, if the
latter alternative is our choice,
some program similar to the one
I have outlined here and much
more must be instituted.

Condensation of Vesper Sermon

By OR. WILLIAM BENFIELD

Progress in forceful Christian
living is inseparably related to
men and women who can stand up
and say “I believe.” This right to
believe or not believe is a precious
freedom but there are some things
which need always to be recognized
about those who do not profess be-
lief in God. For one thing, some
so-called disbelief is essentially
not a protest against the existence
of God but against crude and
childish concepts of Him. Then,
too, some probably deny the exis-
tence of “God on a basis which
cannot be substantiated. There are
the people who protest this thing
called faith and claim to live by
fact alone. They pride themselves
on being realists but they forget
the fact that when there is no
real participation in life, there can
be no wholesome growth apart
from the element of faith.

If our Christian belief is to be
meaningful and productive, we
must remember two things. We
must never be apologetic for our
belief nor should we be ashamed
of our doubts. Every man has his
creed, of one kind or another. The
Christian must stand up for that
which he believes or his Christian.
ity is meaningless. At the same
time, however, it must be remem.
bered that doubt is not necessarily
a sign of weakness. The person
does not live who has never said
“I do not know” and who has never
been tempted to say “I wonder...”

The important thing is te be will.
ing to face up te doub?, examine it
honestly and openly, and te em
phasize the things we can and de
believe. Membership in Christ's
Church is not reserved for those
who have all the answers but for
those who want to find the
answers. The Christian Church is
not intended for people who have
already arrived but people who
are willing to launch out in the
adventure of growing in the better
Nfe—committing themselves to
pnrist and being willing to follow

Letter to the Editor:

Dear Editor:

It has been hard to see why
books should cost more at the col-
lege bookstore than almost any
other source (such as Efird’s, or
other bookstores), We are aware
that students do not have to buy
their books at the college store and
that the prices are usually the
book list prices. We still feet that
a lowering in price might be
achieved, or at least figures and
reasons should be shown as to why
this lowering in price cannot be
accomplished here.

Our Tight Little
World

Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish master
of paradox, had these unparadoxical
words to say to this Davidson generation:

“What is education? I should suppose
that education was the curriculum one
had to run through in order, to catch up
with oneself, and he who will not pass
through this curriculum is helped very
little by the fact that he was born in the
most enlightened age.” ,

We can catch only a glimpse of the
full meaning of these words. Once upon
a time we were so sure that we had all
the answers (what did it matter that we
did not know the questions?) but now
we are not so sure. The glory of certainty
has departed, leaving us humble before
the vast areas of our ignorance. Our col-
lege education has taken us out of the
deep ruts of our provincialism and given
us new insights into life. Or has it?

Unfortunately, the Davidson student
body falls short of the idealized portrait
drawn above. We form such a tight little
family that it is possible to pass through
this institution of “liberal education” with-
out once having our most precious views
seriously challenged. We enter believing
in the supremacy of our unique culture
and we shall probably leave with our faith
still unshaken.

UNIVERSITY CHRISTIAN MISSION |

A significant example of our unwilling-
ness to “catch up with ourselves” is the
“reception given to the University Chris. .
tian Mission with its theme “The Mature
Christian in a Changing South2’ Previous. |
ly we had complained that the Religious
Emphasis Weeks were so far removed
from everyday life that they had little
interest for us. But when the UCM at-
tempted to apply Christian principles to
important areas of what we usually regard
as secular life, we suddenly found that we
did not want anyone telling us that our
previous concepts of life and religion
might be wrong.

We sit calmly through a chapel speech
which tells us we ought to love our neigh-
bor, because we have heard all this before
and know that things really should be
that way, of course. But when an ethics
professor tells us that we can demonstrate
our Christian love by accepting a Supreme
Court decision, we conclude that he has
overstepped the traditional boundary be-
tween the “ought to be’’and the “shall be.”

Or when the same professor tells us
that our growing industrialization in the
South is based on cheap unorganized
labor, our regional pride is injured and
we begin to suspect him of trying to stir
up uncalled for controversies between
workers and employers.

OVERSIMPLIFICATION

Take the much-debated football issue
as another example. We oversimplify the
issue so greatly that persons voting on a
petition may not realize that they can
object to the manner in which the petition
was drawn up and circulated without at
the same time necessarily objecting to
subsidization. The question is submitted
as either/or, but neither may be the cor-
rect answer.

REFLEX ATTITUDES

Student opinion tends to be a reflex
action which opposes whatever action may
be taken by the faculty or the trustees.
When will we realize that the college
officials have the interests of the college
quite as much in mind as we have, and
that they have a much broader back-
ground of experience from which to draw
in making their decisions?

All too frequently we deny ourselves
the opportunity to catch up with ourselves
by shutting out any ideas that challenge
the ideas which have become so comfort-
able for us that we do not want to disturb
them.

If Emerson was correct in his defini-
tion, there are probably few scholars at
Davidson College.—M.A.C.
