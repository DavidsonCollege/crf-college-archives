A speech and readings by
author Imamu Amiri Baraka
on Monday night opened
Black Week, 1976.

President of the Black
Student Coalition, Derry
Harper, pointed out the need
for a week of activities that is
oriented towards a black
audience.

‘“‘Davidson is an isolated
institution,’’ said Harper.
“Black students have a
heightened problem in adjust-
ing, especially if they-come
from a predominantly black
background.

“Having this week gives us
a chance to come into contact
with other black students and
allows us to invite performers
and speakers to the campus
that might not come other-
wise,” he said.

John Munce addressed the
Senate Wednesday night as an
advocate for the incorporation
of student media. (Incorpora-
tion would establish the media
as independent of the jurisdi-
ction of the Davidson College
administration).

He listed as a major reason
for incorporation that ‘‘we
have had violations of the
media in the past,’’ and asked,
‘‘why leave ourselves open?
Incorporation would separate
us from the legal entity of the
college, and therefore release

annual festival centered
around ‘‘expressions. in
black’’, but this year the
diversity of activities
sponsored has been increased
to include events that range
from an address by Marxist-
Leninist poet Baraka to
the Gospel Night held Thurs-
day.

Although the Coaltion is
interested in providing diver-
sions throughout the year, it is
restricted by a severe lack of
funds, according to Harper.
For Black Week, the Coaltion
had to pool some eight thou-
sand dollars drawn from over
ten sources.

Twenty-five of the thirty
black students on campus
provided ‘‘needed help’’ in the
planning and coordination of
events for this week. Among
these were Darlene Cunning-
ham, Pat Hudson, Joann Mit-
chel and Harper.

Harper summed up the pur-
pose of the events in an

sibility for what was printed.”

In other action, the Senate
approved four persons to the
Advisory Council on Campus
Life, two to the Council on
Psychological Counseling, and
one to the Library Council.

Benita Franklin, Mark
Rabil, Andy McKelwey, and
Dave Patton were appointed
to campus Life posts, Tricia
Drake and Dave Rainey to the
council on counseling and
Holmes Harden filled the lone
slot on the Library Council.

Later, John Guthrie pre-
sented the SIR course evalua-
tion results from Fall Term to
the Senate.

activities we will present this
week will reflect our feelings of
pride in the uniqueness, the
richness and the diversity of
the black experience.

munity several expressions of
black culture, we can have fur-
