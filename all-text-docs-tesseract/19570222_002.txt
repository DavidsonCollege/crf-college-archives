Council Stand On Elections

A wide-open split between the newly-
formed Elections Board and the Student
Council appeared in the offing as the
Council prepares to vote Monday night
on the hotly-debated proposed changes in
the elections system. .

Tom Morgan, who is chairman of the
Board, is the most outspoken, proponent
of the two revisions, which provide for
balloting for all student body offices and
the three publications to take place in the
Union instead of Chapel, and that the
elections for the offices listed will be run
off simultaneously on one single ballot.

While the argument rages primarily
around the first provision, Morgan finds
himself without any support whatsoever
on the Board which he chairmans, while
Dan LaFar, who has stated from the out-
set his unalterable opposition, is beset
with a Council apparently determined to
push the changes through.

So dead set against the change is
the Elections Board that individuals com-
posing it have said privately that they
would resign rather than implement the
modified system.

The fallibility and unsoundness of
both proposals are obvious. Should the
polling for principal offices be moved
from Chapel, the probable result would
be a decisive and unhealthy decrease in
the number of votes cast. The plan’s sup-
porters are quick to admit this, but say
that this method would insure that votes
cast would represent only those who
have a genuine interest and sense of re-
sponsibility in selecting the next genera-
tion of student leadership, while elimi-
nating the ballot of the man who votes
uncaringly and unthinkingly.

While this in part,may be true, we
feel that it is the duty of those in con-

trol to make voting as easy and conven-
ient to the voter as possible. The idea of
attempting to up the quality of the elec-
torate by making balloting more diffi-
cult is both undemocratic and unsound.
It is important that an officer of the
student body or a student editor have
a sufficient mandate from the body which
he represents in order to effectively and
confidently perform his duties. And cer-
tainly the man who is to preside over
the enforcement of the Honor System
and Student Body Regulations should go

‘into office with the endorsement of at

least a sizable segment of the student
body.

In addition, day-long balloting in the
Union would encourage the mass voting
by fraternities or cliques or the like.
Whether rightly or wrongly, this ap-
proach to elections has always been suc-
cessfully minimized at Davidson, but the
proposed system would inevitably en-
courage combining.

As for the second proposal, forcing
a candidate to choose at the outset be-
tween running for a student government
post or an editorship will sooner or later
cost student leadership the services in re-
sponsible places of highly capable men
‘who lose the election which they choose
to enter, and are then unabie to enter
the other race.

While this type of conflict is not for-
seeable this year, it could easily arise in
the future, and the elections system
should not have to be amended when the
situation arises.

We ask that the Student Council care-
fully reconsider its position before the
vote is cast Monday night, and that pos-
sible reversal be strongly considered.

An Educator For President

The resignation of Dr. Cunningham
has many ramifications and implications.
Few people, even on the faculty, can re-
member when Davidson was not being
guided by his competent and far-reach-
ing hand.

Even though students felt that the
end of his tenure was imminent, it is
hard to think in terms of Davidson apart
from Dr. Cunningham. Truly, he is a part
of the heritage and tradition which he
did so much to formulate.

Now the College is faced with the dif-
ficult task of selecting a new leader. Dr.
Cunningham himself has expressed the
opinion that the main objectives that he
projected for himself have been obtained.
Would it not be for the best if the new
president had something of a different
outlook on the whole program?

To be specific, it appears that Da-
vidson is on an exceptionally sound basis,
financially and physically. The faculty,
as a group, is as fine as is found in the
South. The greatest area for advance-
ment here lies in the whole concept of
teaching.

For this reason, many students have
expressed themselves as being in favor

of an educator as our president. And,
with sound reasoning, they suggest any
one of two or three within the Davidson
campus as candidates both qualified and
worthy of the position.

There are logical sequences for ar-
riving at this conclusion. In the first
place, a member of the present College
Community not only would have a solid
educational background, byt would be
familiar with the Davidson approach to
liberal arts and ready to work carefully
and critically on the program.

It is a well-known fact that, with most
of the outstanding members of the facul-
ty having standing offers of more lucra-
tive positions, a particularly unsavory
selection could result in a mass exodus
of. men Davidson could ill afford to lose.

This is only a small element in the
total argument. Following in the wake of
a man of Dr. Cunningham’s achievement
will be difficult at best. We ask for care-
ful consideration to a person already de-
dicated to Davidson, to one who knows
Davidson’s strong and weak points and
the general trends of education in gen-
eral, and who portrays best the trite old
phrase, “gentleman and scholar.”—F.L.H

Hell Week And The Regulations

Bunny Perkinson and the Interfra-
ternity Council have assumed the
weighty responsibility for the conduct of
Hell Week, which got officially underway
today.

It is a healthy thing that the pro-
gram should be student-regulated, and
that the Faculty has seen fit to remain
in the background. Student leadership
has proved itself capable of dealing out
the reforms in initiation procedures
which the temper of the times has de-
manded.

While the program as set up this
year voids practices recently common-

place but now forsaken, no fraternity
should have trouble in planning an effec-
tive informal initiation. The essence of
what each group feels to be important
should be adle to be retained without
running afoul the letter or even the spirit
of the regulations.

Since this is true, it is of utmost im-
portance that each fraternity take extra
pains to insure that this system works.
While the Faculty seems generally satis-
fied with the present program, if
conscientiously adhered to, it is not in-
conceivable that a rigid crackdown would

follow any glaring abuse or violation of |

the system.

CHAIRMAN OF ELECTIONS BOARD

Student Body Election System
Needs Revitalizing Change

By TOM MORGAN
Chairman, Elections Board

At the meetings of the Elections
Board and the Student Council on
last Monday night I presented pro-
posals for cer-
tain changes in
the _ elections
system at Da-
vidson. The
Student Coun-
cil has consti-
tutionally the
right to decide
what procedure
‘shall be = fol-
lowed in elec-
tions and they

adopted both of these proposals.
Since some reaction has developed
against these proposals and there
is still doubt in the minds of some
of the council members I feel that
the situation merits an explana
tion to the entire student body.

Morgen

Special Polling Places

The first. proposal would move
the place of balloting from Cham-
bers Auditorium to the College
Union. (In lieu of the Union any
Strategically located place could
be used: e.q. the lobby of ‘Cham-
bers.) At the polls would be set
up desks with members of the
Elections Board presiding at them.

To vote a member of the
student body would go to the
appropriately designated
desk, give his name, and re-
ceive a ballot. When he re-

ceived the ballot his name
would be checked off a roster
of the entire student body.
He would then mark his bal-
lot and deposit it, as custom-
arily, in the ballot box.

The polls would remain open
from 10:10 a.m.. to 9:00 p.m., so
as to allow sufficienf time for
every person to vote. The roster
of the student body would be di-
vided up alphabetically at dif-
ferent tables during rush hours
to prevent waiting in long lines.

Many Benefits

I feel that this proposal is bene-
ficial for many reasons:

(1) It will allow voting to take
place five days a week rather than
three as would be the case if vot-
ing ‘took place after chapel.

(2.) All possibilities of vot-
ing more than once or voting
in class elections when one is
not s member of the class
would be eliminated. This
has occurred in almost all past
elections to a small extent
and should be completely
eliminated.

3.) To those who say that the
percentage of students voting
would be cut down by such a pro-
posal, I would suggest that the
vote could rather be increased. A
longer period in the day during
which voting would take place
would give students who have re-
views or some other reason to
miss chapel a chance to vote later
in the day. In addition, some dis-

ke to sit

interested group like ODK could
put on a “Get out and Vote” cam-
paign to make students conscious
of their responsibility.

(4.) The plan would pro-
mote good citizenship. A stu-
dent would have to take time
to think before he voted. He
would realize that voting was
a more serious matter than
merely marking the first
name he saw on a slip of
paper he was hended as he
left chapel.

Citizenship, oddly enough, is
one of the traits that we are never
taught at Davidson. Certainly to
have obtained an adequate college
education of the calibre Davidson
gives in other areas, one should
have also learned to realize some
of his responsibilities as a citizen.
This is training which cannot be
given by the faculty in lectures.
It must be promoted by student
organizations through participa-
tion.

Would Combine Ballots

The second proposal. as amend-
ed by the election board before
I presented it to the Student
Council provides that the elec-
tions for Student Body officers,
and editors of all three publica-
tions should be held simultane-
ously at the first of the election
period. This prevents a man for
running for more than one of
these offices. That is, losing one
and then trying for another. Al-
so, it would help to speed the
elections process, which as all up-
per classmen know is a long and
erduous process.

0 feel that if a man is nomi-
nated for two of these posi-
tions, he should be able to
choose in which of them he
could contribute most to the
student body.

In the past candidates have been
concerned with winning an office,
any office, for the prestige value
and not for what they could con-
tribute through the position. This
is not a mature attitude toward
extra-curricular participation.

Encourages Specializing

The adoption of this proposal
would encourage a student to put
all his effort in one of these four
channels as he went through
school. Then, as a senior he would
have no difficult decision to make.

These proposals are only one
part of an overall idea to encour-
age more reasoned participation
in extra-curriculars. Along with
them will have to go such changes
as a revitalized and effective point
system to limit extra-curricular
participation. Also, during orien-
tation more emphasis must be
placed on extra-curricular guid.

LETTER TO EDITOR
Required Vespers,

Chapel Questioned

Dear Editor,

“, .. LT take no delight in your
solemn assemblies.” Amos 5:21.

There is a certain difference
between the attitude toward ves-
pers and chapel of Davidson stu-
dents, and that which the College
would like the students’ attitude
to be. The administration has la-
bored very hard and very sincere-
ly toward bringing us into a vital
awareness and understanding of
religion by improving the quality
and content of chapel and ves-
pers services.

I have sensed an improvement
in the past two years. At the
same time it must be realized
that the best program by a famous
and distinguished religious lead-
er will have little effect upon the
hearers, unless the audience is
eager to hear the message. It
seems to me that we do not pos-
sess a yearning desire to rush to
chapel or vespers.

There appear to be two pos-
sible answers which are interde-
pendent. One depends on our own
responsibility to change our own
attitude. We indeed have a long
way to go in order to snap out
of our languor. Another solution
depends upon the patterns and
codes which are enforced upun
us. I do not believe that Christi-
anity should oblige one to believe,
for this seems antithetical to the
Christian message. Faith can not
be forced.

If Christianity involves and
necessitates the free acceptance
of God, then religious rules and
codes should be so constructed
as to best enable one to worship
God of his own free will. At pre-
sent, however, there are two wor-
ship services on campus which are
forced upon students. This situa-
tion does not seem spiritually
healthful.

Perhaps the College administra-
tion might look at this problem
and reply that although this is
true, it is also necessary because
Davidson is a Presbyterian col-
lege. I recognize the extreme dif-
ficulty in attempting to solve a
problem like this, and I appreci-
ate the position of the College.
I realize that I have the prejudice
of a student in my views also.

I would nevertheless propose
these two considerations: (1) that

Two kinds of fraternity men
participate in Hell. Week. There
are those who ridicule, harass,
and order pledges to do ridicu-
lous things simply to glorify their
own egos, satisfy repressed de-
sires for power, and titillate. their
somewhat distorted senses of hu-
mor. On the other hand, there are
those who require pledges to act
constructively and immediately, in
order that they may be reminded
of the responsibility, dependabili-
ty, and self-discipline which fra-
ternity Fife requires, and which
may be of value to the world of
more significant affairs beyond
the confines of the campus.

it is only in this latter re-
spect that any form of “in
formal initiation” is justified,
so it behooves each member
of every fraternity to exemine
the motives, methods, and
consequences involved in any
ect required of pledges, to in-
sure thet whet is being done
is for the mutual benefit ofs
the pledge and the fraternity.

Peter, the Practical Politician
(a boy with real leadership abili-
ties), came to Davidson, and de-
cided to become a BMOC. Te
achieve his goal, he utilized cer-
tain political techniques used in
mational and state elections, but
to his dismay, he was eliminated
on the first ballot, and later dis.
qualified as a voter for violating
Article V. Section 9, of the Stu.
dent Government Constitution.

Having learned the hard way
that Campus Politics has little re-
semblance to national politics,
Peter drew up a list of rules for
political success at Davidson,
which he applied successfully dur-
ing the following year, and defeat-

attendance at chapel and vespers
be made voluntary, or (2) that
attendance at vespers be made
voluntary and that chapel be
turned into a student assembly
(which, in fact, it is now.)

In reply to these suggestions
one might say that if attendance
at vespers drops off, the quality
of speakers will -‘orrespondingly
diminish. I do noi believe that
this necessarily follows. If it
should, I hold that the vitality
and interest of the audience or
congregation is more important
than the number of degrees fol-
lowing the speaker’s name.

Here are his rules, in order of
their importance:.

(1) Completely hide any politi-
cal pretensions and ambitions be-
hind a facade of seeming inno-
cence.

(2) Learn the name of each stu-
dent, and use it on every con-
ceivable occasion.

(3) Never disagree with anyone
about anything (publicly).

(4) When significant issues are
involved, be conservative.

(5) When insignificant issues

solutions of problems.

oe @ @he

The student body has a ten-
dency to be severely critical of
chapel talks which present a re-
actionary religious point of view,
perhaps with some justification.
But before we condemn a person
completely for such a position, we
should perhaps remind ourselves
that it takes considerable intesti-
nal fortitude to say what we real-
ly believe under such circum-
stances.

We might also recall the Chris-
tian maxim which is applicable
to most circumstances even if we
reject the authority of its source:
“Let him who is without sin cast
the first etone.”
