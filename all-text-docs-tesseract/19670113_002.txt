Think First

Pity the poor freshman. No sooner
does he finish his first, trying, if not
traumatic, examination period than
hordes of super-cool fraternity men
converge on him, each describing the
unique virtues and advantages of
membership in his particular exalted
order.

Despite a semester of low-key rush-
ing, freshmen are generally painfully
ignorant of what fraternity member-
ship entails. Fraternities offer a num-
ber of advantages on an otherwise
socially-barren campus, particularly
on dance weekends. Few people, offer-
ed the chance. would choose one of
the Social Council’s dry, on-campus
functions over the primitive condi-
tions fraternities offer, as epitomized
by. though not restricted to, liquor. or
a suitable substitute, in light of the
state's neo-Prohibition.

But this year’s freshmen, despite a
lack of frank exposure to the fraterni-
ty question, doubtless came to David-
son more sophisticated than their
predecessors. And a semester: of im-
provising their own social structures

and entertainment has made them less
dependent on the structured social life
found on Patterson Court.

At the same time, subsisting for a
year on Slater food and putting up
with an inadequate Union program.
hampered by a lack of funds. makes
the prospect of fraternity pledging al-
most too attractive to pass up. in spite
of whatever reservations the critical
freshman possesses.

Despite the administration’s refusal
to realistically acknowledge the plight
of individuals wanting an alternative
to fraternity life and despite the re-
fusal to make the commitment neces-
sary to provide for such an alternative.
tremendous strides have been made
in the past several years.

The prospect of continued improve-
ments is likely, though by no means
certain. But it should at least give the
thinking freshman cause to reflect
before being pressured into a four-
year relationship that could, and often
does, restrict his growth as an individ-
ual.

Unrealistic Timetable

The Blue Sky Committee’s time-
table released last week, giving a
schedule for implementation of the
proposed curriculum revision and re-
form suggests a striking parallel to
President Johnson’s War on Poverty
— a good idea, with good intentions,
but too eager for quick tangible re-
sults.

Last spring, when the structure of
the committee was first being formu-
lated, and again this fall, Dean Fron-
tis Johnston suggested the curriculum
reform would entail almost revolu-
tionary changes, changes that would
put Davidson in the vanguard of edu-
cational institutions.

But the committee is now request-
ing reports from a number of its sub-
committees by March, when the make-
up of the subcommittees has hardly
been named. It is in these groups that
much of the groundwork and investi-
gation should take place. Three
months is hardly time to do a thorough
job.

The schedule makes no allowance
for contingencies that may arise. Yet
it is inconeeivable that when such im-
portant changes are being effected.
when so many vested interests are in-
volved. when so many diverse groups
are represented. things will go ac-
cording to schedule.

The inevitable result of. the hurry-
up job would be either less-than-
adequate changes because of improper
homework or, should the radical
changes envisioned come about, a
makeshift structure whose defects
will eventually come to light with the
test of the years.

Davidson has gone a long time with-
out a Blue Sky Committee; unfortun-
ately, the present committee will be
the last one for a like number of years.

The long-term character of the re-
form, as weil as the potential for truly
forward-looking changes, make it
worthwhile to spend a little more time
to insure a meaningful project.

No Organ-ization

A completely revamped curriculum
by 1968. A pioneering interdiscipli-
nary science. course. Four new endow-
ed professorships. The prospects are
exciting, and our imagination leads us
to reveries of Davidson College taking
its place among the really great edu-
cational institutions.

But then some little thing brings us
back to earth and reminds us that this
is still a Presbyterian college set in
the Piedmont of North Carolina. As
such it’s justified in pulling stunts that
would be bush league anywhere else.

A lack of planning and coordination

‘turned the occasion of the dedication

Monday of the organ in Love Audito-
rium into a comedy of errors.

After a number of postponements,
the date was set for last Monday. But
missing parts, forced the concert .to
be moved to the church. making it the
first time an organ was ever dedicated
by. proxy, as organist Wilmér Welsh
quipped to his patient audience.

The only trouble was that most of
the audience missed Mr. Welsh’s hu-
mor because of chattering teeth. It
seems that someone didn’t get the
message about the removal of the con-
cert to the church. Consequently, the
central heat had been off for a num-
ber of hours, and the audience sat
through the concert without removing
their coats. ,

It's a comforting thought that things
are going along, as usual.

Mature Election System

This year has seen an unprecedent-
ed interest in and effectiveness of
student government in academic and
social matters, indicating a more so-
phisticated, and informed student
voice. ‘Now is the time for the Student
Council to begin revamping election
laws to bring the anachronistic struc-
ture into harmony with the new politi-
cal acumen.

Three years ago changes were made
to allow platforms to be mimeograph-
ed, encouraging candidates to ap-
proach the campaign somewhat more
thoughtfully. Since that time, plat-
forms have become so homogeneous
and prolific that few people make a
serious effort to be informed of candi-
dates’ stands.

The most serious obstacle today to
a streamlined election system is the
restriction on bloc voting, for it fails
in its intended purpose, while curtail-
ing the positive benefits that could be
derived from bloc voting.

The justification for the ban is, of
course, to discourage fraternities’ vot-
ing as groups and trading votes for
favorite candidates. Yet such practices
go on. and few would try to stop it, if
indeed they could.

At the same time, the ban prevents
the formation of groups, parties, if
you will, formed expressly for the pur-
pose of promoting a particular plan of
action, composed of reasonably like-
minded people. Parties would not only
force candidates to think out even
more carefully their plans of action,
but they would also increase the ef-

fectiveness of elected student leaders.
who could present a more united
front. .
Naturally, one cannot simply decide
he will form a party. Parties must
spring from a genuine need. They may
nevér appear on campus. But there is
no excuse for maintaining useless
rules which restrict their formation,
should the need arise.

Civil Disobedience

It’s hard to accept affirmations of
administration concern for student
welfare, supposedly one of the advan-
tages of a small school, when the
president of the college passes off the
conflict between state and college
liquor laws with a bland “students
must obey the state law or suffer the
consequences.”

Such a statement and the refusal of
the faculty to remedy the situation,
by bringing college rules in line with
civil law indicates either a refusal to
face the reality of the campus liquor
situation or a stubborn obsession with
the idea that nothing is more import-
ant than the faculty drinking rule.

One of the products of a liberal arts
college should be a respect for the
State and its institutions. Yet by the
very existence of the ban on liquor in
dorm rooms the administration is giv-
ing the student a choice of obeying
the faculty rule and in the process dis-
regarding State law or of conforming
with the state law and risking suspen-
sion.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Fraternities Hurt Some
But Benefit Many More

‘Dear Editor:

Mr. Bailey's ‘‘Gospel"’ col-
umn of fast week's DAVID.
SONIAN echoes an argument
against fraternities that has
been resounding at Davidson
for at least as ‘long as I have
been here, but an argument
that has failed to dissuade 75%
or so of the classes each year
from affiliating with fraterni-
ties.

An argument that favors the
abolition of such a widespread
system is hardly going to gain
ready support from. the great
number of people. here who
have benefitted from. the sys
tem and who believe the sys-
tem can benefit others.

However. being a member
of a fraternity. 1 don’t believe
TI am.a particular exception
when I say from the fraternity
point of view that fraternity
life is not the only workable
system for those who desire
some social life at Davidson.

The establishment of the so
cial council. the increased ac-
tivities in the Union, and the
allowance ‘for freshman cars
on campus are notable exam-
ples that the independent at
Davidson no longer lives in a
stagnant. social environment.

In Mr. Bailey's and my
freshman year. there was little
time for us to observe the cons
as well as the prus of the
fraternity system
course there are both in a-
bundance), but the freshmen
this year have had a semes-
ter to observe that system and
see that there is the question
of if fraternity as well as which
fraternity.

If a freshman decides on
his own that he does not need
the type of social life, fellow-
ship. etc. that fraternities -of-

(and of :

fer, he should not pledge. If
he is rejected by the system
he should have already seen
that such a rejection means
neither the loss of friends in
fraternities, nor the death
sentence on his suetess at Da-
vidson.

It would be a boon to the
entire social system at David-
son if the men not interested
in fraternities were to remain
independent. thereby strength-
ening the independent sectors
of the campus by killing the
sity idea some students have
that independents are some-
how inferior. and making more
room in the houses for those
interested men who might
have otherwise been rejected.
as well as reducing apathy
within the houses.

When the fraternity system
is considered fully and ob-
jectively by the student body
and rejected, then it will be
time the system folded. But.
to counter Mr. Bailey's con-
cluding statement. as long as
a segment of the student body
is- benefitted by a part of the
college. we have no call to
flatly outlaw such a system.

Officer Sees Duty,
Looks For Liquor

Dear Editor:

Tuesday night several stu-
dents encountered an unfor-
tunate incident in more ways
than one.

A student engaged in some
typical dormitory antics fell
out of a second story window
in Richardson and seriously

We were trying to get him
safely onto a makeshift
stretcher and into.a car when
up prances Cop Linker's right
hand man, all thumbs and a
big badge,

After being informed that
the boy had fallen, this law
enforcer immediately saw his
duty, and, with a comment to
the effect that “He must have
been pretty drunk to fall out of
a window,” he ran upstairs
for one of his exciting room
searches, a gleam.in his eye
and hands on his note pad and
pencil.

Meanwhile. we struggled un
aided to get the boy to the hos

hide and seek with some ghost
beer cans on second floor
Richardson.

Thanks, Johnnv.

Fools’ Name

Fools’ Faces laf

Hey You - Freshman

THIS BEING THE LAST issue of THE DAVID.
SONIAN before Rush Week begins, I would like to
offer some comments about that venerable tradi:
tion and some of the aspects of the System of which
it is a part. You have heard a great deal from upper-
classmen about our fraternity system lately, and you
will hear a great deal more before rush is over;
everyone has his own opinion on it, which he will
readily offer. If you're tired of it, don’t read any
more of this column. I wouldn’t blame you because
I’m tired of it, too; I’d like to ignore the whole thing.

But ignoring the problem won’t make it go
away, and I am concerned about it. ] am concerned
because I love Davidson College — its strengths and
its weaknesses — and it has given me a great deal,
probably more than I deserve.

AND BECAUSE I love this college I am interest-
ed in her future; a major portion of the fortunes of
her future lies in the hands of those whom she
serves, her students, of which the Freshman Class
is a distinct entity. In other words, I am concerned
with the fortunes of this Freshman Class in the‘
college. 1 hope that they can learn from the mistakes
of the past and avoid them in the future.

The times when each class went through rush
the first week of school, when freshmen really had
to obey Freshman Regulations, when “Joe Jones
would get you” if you didn’t are gone. But we still
have rush, even though it has been moved to a better
time. And rush will not disappear, nor should it.

Because there is nothing to take its place until
we (the college) solve the much larger problem of the
whole social life of the student at Davidson, and by
social I mean all aspects of his life spent outside the
classroom itself. _

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? I can’t form and give

an accurate conceptualization, but it seems to me to’
center around the idea that Davidson College isn’t
the exciting and stimulating place that it appears it
1S on paper. The amazing thing is that it does as
well as it does.
_ And I think part of the problem is that the exist-
ing fraternity system somehow—I don’t know how
or why—saps, takes up and out a major portion of
the energy of the college. And I don’t have any solu-
tion to any part of the problem; I don’t know of
anyone who does. Maybe they don’t think there is
any problem.

1 am not going to criticize the fraternity system;
I'm not “against it.” It’s not a fraternity system -any-
way; it’s a system of eating clubs, and it is necessary
because people are going to congregate somewhere
0 eat.

THERE IS VERY LITTLE, if any, “brotherhood”
on Patterson Court and few “brothers” will claim
that there is. It is a necessary form of social organiza-
tion. I don’t know of a single member of my class
who is a “gung-ho” fraternity man.

Those who are in fraternities have friends in
other fraternities and friends who are not in fra-
ternities. If they spend more time with the boys of
their own fraternity, it is only because they know
them better. have been exposed to them more. And
there are always people in their own fraternity that
they don’t care much for. It is the same old Story.

_. YOU MUST CREATE your own patterns of
living if you are not in a fraternity; you must be
your own man. Obviously, not everyone wants to do
this: Some people need the support that a fraternity
offers at first. Later, they stay there because it is the
easiest thing to do. and they have formed friendships
and living patterns which they have accepted.

_, No, I'm not going to tell you whether or not to
Join a fraternity nor how to choose one if you de-
cided to join. Hopefully, you have been thinking
about these decisions already. You will be doing
more thinking and judging during rush, and I want
to make only one comment about rush: Remember
that it is what its label implies.

It is when the fraternities have their best foot
forward, and the pressure is on. It is just like your
giving the “rush” to some sweetie. But above all, I
want to urge that you not let yourself get caught up
in the onrush of emotionalism prevalent during rush.
_ MAKE A COOL and calculated decision, a ra-
tional one. You will probably stick by it for the rest
of your career at Davidson; it will definitely affect
the rest of your life.

If you pay no attention to the rest of this column,
I beg you to accept this advice: Make a rational de-
cision. Rush is a process of selling and buying, and

the motto of the marketpl 3
beware! place applies: Let the buyer

Army Preserves ‘Heritage Of Freedom'

ED. NOTE: The following article
is taken from a recent issue of
Arthur Hoppe’s daily column “Our
Man Hoppe” as reprinted by Chroni-
cle Features.

“Excuse me, Captain,” said Priv-
ate Oliver Drab, 378-18-4454,
saluting. “But that was sure a swell
indoctrination talk you gave us on
‘Our Precious Heritage of Free-
dom.’ And we wondered could we
get a copy maybe?”

“Well, thank you, soldier,” said
Captain Buck Ace. preening his
military. moustache. “We want you
boys to know what you're fighting
or.”

“Yes, sir. And we'd like to run it
in the first edition of our news-
paper. Right next to my editorial,
‘None Dare Call It Slop.’ That's
about our chow, sir.”

“Newspaper? Slop?”

Yes, sir,” said Private Drab, en-
thusiastically. “Like you said, sir,
a free press is the cornerstone of
progress. And we want to do our
part. I guess you kind of inspired
us, sir.”

“Look here, Drab,” said the Cap-
tain with annoyance, “you can’t
Start up a newspaper. It’s against

Army regs.”

“I can’t, sir?” said the Private,
crestfallen. “But how can we pass
the word to the fellows about join-
ing the union?”

“Union?” said Captain Ace with a
scowl]. ‘What union?”

“Well, you know, sir, how you
talked about one of the blessings
of democracy being the free trade
union movement. And we figured
that we were all kind of in the same
trade and not too happy with our
conditions...”

“Working conditions?” The Cap-
tain looked stunned.

“Well, it’s mostly wages and
hours, sir,” explained Private Drab.
“But some of us are pretty concern-
ed about inadequate safety factors.
You know this thing I’ve got about
not wanting to get killed. But if we
could negotiate a package...”

The Captain’s face darkened.
“This is the Army, soldier!”

“Oh, don't worry, sir. We wouldn’t
call a strike in the middle of battle
or anything like that. No, sir, if
some grievance did come up in the
middle of battle, we'd be perfect-
ly willing to submit it to compul-
sory arbitration.”

“Drab, you’re a trouble-maker!
Where did you get these crazy
ideas?”

“From you, sir. You said...”

_One more peep out of you sol-
dier, and it’s a court martial!”

“But sir, what about freedom of
Speech? You talked about freedom
of speech and said... ”

“SHUT UP!” thundered the Cap-
tain. With a manful effort he pulled
himself together. “Of course, son,”
he Said, smiling sweetly, “the Army
also believes in freedom of religion.
You can take your problems to the
chaplain of your choice.”

“I don’t understand it,” said
Private Drab later to his friend,
Corporal Partz, as they squatted on
the ground, eating out of their mess
kits. “The Army tells me what an
honor it is to fight for these free-
bt and then it gets sore if I want

“Don't worry,” said Corporal
Partz. “I know in my heart that the
day will come when we'll enjoy all
the freedoms this here Army’s
fighting for.”

“Honest?” said Private Drab
hopefully. “When?”

‘When we get out of the Army,”
said Corporal Partz.
