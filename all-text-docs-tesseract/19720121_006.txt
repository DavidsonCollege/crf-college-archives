Money Brings WDAV To Grey House

By BILL GIDUZ
Staff Writer

After four and a half months
of repairs and reorganization,
campus radio station WDAV
(640 AM) is back on the air.

The station began operations
in April, 1970, and operated with
increasing difficulty until the
first few days of this school
year. At that time, the quality
of the station’s inadequate
equipment had degenerated so
much that it was necessary to
ierminate broadcasting until re-
pairs could be made.

Station manager Scott Keeter

told about the state of the sta-
tion at the beginning of this
year. “Our engineer Skip Smoak
had done an excellent job of
wiring in that he had matched
things that were never intended
to be matched. But after a
while things caught up with us
and our studio facilities got to
the point where we had a mi-
crophone amd one turntable
working but that was it.”

Also, the station’s signal,
which reached only the dorms
and the president’s house, was
of a very poor quality due to re-
wiring in some of the dorms
over the summer break.

Keeter and other members of
the staff appealed to the Stu-
dent Senate and administration
for funds after the station was
shut down, and their request
for $4,000 was met. The money
was used for a new turntable,
a $2,300 control board, and to
pay professional engineers who
set up all the new equipment
during Christmas break. Keeter
commented, ‘‘Now we have an
A-1 operation in terms of our
signal. We've also added Grey
House to our transmitting set-
up.”

The new control board will
permit a greater degree of ver-

Arabs Thrown Into Desert
By Zionist Military Power

By STEVE CROSS
Staff Writer

“The Middle Eastern crisis is
a very complicated problem,”
said Hatem I. Hussaini. *‘From
my point of view it has been
greatly distorted.” Hussaini is a
Palestinian Arab who spoke in-
formally in the Morrison Room
Monday at 8:00 p.m.

Hussaini, who works for the
Arab Information Center in
Washington, D. C., said that
many people support Israel to-
day out of sympathy for the
persecution of Jews in the past,
but he did not agree with the
Zionist position of support for
Israel.

The Jews do mot need a state

of their own simply because
they were persecuted, Hussaini
said. The land they settled on
had been previously occupied
by Moslem and Christian Arabs
for centuries.

Hussaini said that the new
Israeli state was forced upon
the Palestinians ‘‘by British oc-
cupation and later by Zionist
military power.” There are now
1.5 million Palestinian refu-
gees in surrounding countries.

The Arab professor said that
when he himself visited the
Middle East in 1969 he was not
permitted into Jerusalem, the
city of his birth, because ex-
iled Palestinians are not per-
mitted to return unless they

al] in the 1972-73 academic year.

The largest portion of the
funds, $135,000, will be used for
“compensaticn (salaries and
tringe benefits) . . .; cost of liv-
ing adjustments: special merit
adjustments where deemed nec-
essary; faculty and staff en-
richment, including grants for
iravel and research: special
training of staff personnel.”

Also $65,0000 will go to libra-
ry operations in a time when
book prices have increased up
to 10 percent and the college’s
new curriculum has required
additional reading and research
materials.

A third portion, $30,000, will
assist the college in remodeling
present structures om campus
into facilities for College Union
activities. The present Union
building will be razed in June
1972 since the new E. H. Little
Library will be built on the site

Studies are now being con-
ducted by Davidson to deter-
mine where to place Union
functions during construction of
the library and in future years.
It has already been determined
that Union dining operations
will be divided among three
houses on Patterson Court no
longer occupied by social fra-

ternities.
for the contining support of the
years,” said President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. ‘Without this
support. the quality of our pro-
grams, facilities amd personnel
could not be what it is today."

ment has provided financial as-

sistance to Davidson, and to-

have members of their imme-
diate family in Israeli-occupied
territory.

He rejected the religious idea
that God “promised” Palestine
to the Jews as ‘‘nonsense,” and
added that ‘“‘there is no rela-
tion between ancient Hebrews
aod modern Jews.”

He said that present-day Jews
are descendents of converted
Romans, Greeks, Phoenicians,
Arabs and other nationalities as
well as the ancient Hebrews.

Recalling the claim that the
Arabs want to throw all Isra-
elis imto the sea, Hussaini said
that he did not think that that
was true. On the contrary, the
Palestinians were thrown into
the desert, he said, and it was
only natural that they would
want to fight back.

Hussaini’s solution to the prob-
lem is a “secular democratic
state” im which all Arabs and
Jews would be equal. He said
that all Palestinian Arabs
should be permitted to return
home.

He decried conditions in Is-
raeli-occupied Jordan and Gaza
territories, in which he said that
Arabs are detained without trial
and transferred to other areas
against their will.

Hussaini noted that there are
many Jews in the United States
and in Israel who support the
Palestinian struggle, naming
specifically the Israeli Socialist
Organization in Israel, and in
the United States many young
Jewish political activists.

Rogers Accepts Call

By KURT GEISINGER
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Presby-
terian Church, without a minis-
ter for almost a year, has @nal-
ly found a man to fill the em.
pty pulpit.

John B. Rogers, Jr., a 1963
Davidson graduate and an alum.
nus of Union Theological Sem-
inary in Virginia, has accepted
‘ne Davidson congregation's call
and will assume his duties here
in mid-February.

Rogers, presently the associ-
ate minister at the First Pres-
byterian Church of
where he has served for a little
over a year, has also served as
an instructor in the Depart-

Durham.

ment of Religion and as chap-
lain to students at Presbyterian
College.

Rogers, who is ‘looking for-
ward to getting to know David-
sot students personally,” feels
that “‘the church as a commu.
nity should minister to the
needs of the students.” He also
said that he encourages the
church to ‘be the living body
of Christ.”

The new minister is “‘optimis-
tic about the potential of the
Davidson congregation. It can
become a real community of
faith, a true prophetic commu-
nity,” living in the present in
such a way as to build the fu-
ture.

satility in the WDAV program
schedule. A telephone has been
hooked into the board so that
students can call in to request
songs (892-1908) and on the air
conversations can be ccnduct-
ed.

The basic programing sched.
ule will be the same as it was
before the station left the air
in September. Classical music
will occupy the 7-9 p.m. shift
followed by an hour of educa-
tional programming, and con-
temporary music will be on the
air from 10 p.m. until sign-off
at 1 a.m.

The educaticnal shows will
feature programs on many sub-
jects, ranging from ‘“‘The Swed-
ish Woman” to forums on po-
litical issues.

This year’s staff is composed
of Keeter as manager, Eric
Vernon as personnel director,
Mike O'Malley and Gary Scibal
are in charge of sports, and
George Kaneklides will head up
the WDAV editorial board.

There is stil! space for any-
one who is interested in work-
ing for the station, however.

Keeter spoke about this, ‘We
encourage everyone who has
any interest at all, even if they
don’t have any experience or
talent, to come out and pitch in
a hand with the station. We
feel that the station can benefit
the student body in more than
one way. Not only can they
listen to it, but they can also
learn something by coming and
participating in it.”

Future plans for the station
are mainly directed toward go-
ing FM. The step would be rela-
tively inexpensive, only $3,000.
but the administration and staff
want to be sure that the pro-
gramming is of sufficient qual-
ity to merit broadcast to the
entire community.

Overali, Keeter seems quite
happy that the station is now in
such good shape and he is look-
ing forward to 2 progressive
future for the station. *‘We’re
excited about being on the air
and hope that the student body
and faculty will share in our
cathusiasm and will come in
and share in some of the fun
and some of the work so we
can make it into all it can be.”
