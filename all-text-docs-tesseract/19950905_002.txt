Gullan promises
more interaction

By Jason McMULLAN
Staff Writer

Together with Vice President
Warren Buford, SGA President Bill
Gullan hopes that the student gov-
ernment can take a more hands-on
approach to campus affairs this
year.

“Taking decisions out of a po-
litical environment and putting
them in the hands of people who
are interested and enthusiastic at
making progress and changes” tops
Gullan’s agenda.

Gullan plans to increase sen-
ate meetings totwo per week. “The
second won’t be an official meet-
ing; attendance will not be manda-
tory, and minutes won’t be taken.
Instead, I hope it will be a town
meeting-type thing, with more stu-
dent interaction.”

Gullan also stresses that all
SGA meetings, the first scheduled
for Tuesday, September 5, are open
to anybody who wishes to come.

Increasing student govern-
ment activity also rests in the new
Student Advisory Councils
(SACs). An integral part of
Gullan’s campaign last year, the
new process will form SACs to
talk about problems and discuss
ways to make campus organiza-

tions more student friendly.

Current plans will set up coun-
cils with the directors of three de-
partments: Residence Life, Cam-
pus Safety, and Auxiliary Services.
The committees will be formed by
the end of this month.

The positions will be perma-
nent so that members really be-
come aware and informed about
campus issues, and to builda sound

relationship between students and °

administration.

Gullan would also like to form
an ad-hoc committee to discuss
drinking and driving both on and
off campus. He will present plans
to utilize the Rides Committee to
help the impaired get home safely,
which would greatly expand the
duties of the committee beyond
transportation to the airport during
holidays.

Gullan also hopes to finalize
plans to allow cigarette sales on
campus, extend, Cat card use to
local businesses, and form a cam-
pus beautification/preservation
committee.

Emphasizing involvement for
this year, he states, ‘““We’ve made
an attempt since January to get
active and represent the student
body, and the best way to insure
that we continue is to get involved.”

Food Share Program
offers discount
groceries for service

By Rosert Briccs
Staff Writer

Davidson students looking for
a way to stretch their food budgets
are well advised to look into the
Food Share Program.

The Food Share Program is a
service-for-food program spon-
sored by the Ada Jenkins Commu-
nity Center in Davidson and is
conducted in conjuction with an
area grocery distribution ware-
house.

The program is open to all
members of the community, in-
cluding college students. Any per-
son willing to pay $15.05 at the
beginning of the month and con-
tribute a few hours of community
service is eligible, regardless of
socio-economic background, race,
or nationality. In return for their
time and monetary investment,
participants receive $25 to $30 of
grocery products at the end of the
month.

The service portion of the pro-
gram may range from writing a
letter for an-elderly person to de-
livering groceries to the home of
someone who is physically unable
to shop for himself or herself.

Correction:
In an article last week, The
Davidsonian reported that
the mediun SAT score for
the Class of 1999 was
1190-1270, when really
itis 1190-1310.

Anyone interested in partici-
pating in the program forthe month
of September should call Lena
Connor at 892-9566 after 4:30 p.m.
to arrange a time to bring money
and place an order.

Connor stresses that the pro-

_gram will accomodate anybody

willing to participate, and that it is
a good way to help yourself and
your community at the same time.

One of the new additions to campus this fall includes an access ramp on the

north side of Chambers.

Davidson updates to meet
Disabilities Act requirements

By CATHERINE HART
&: ANDY ARMSTRONG
Staff Writers

The campus may seem alittle
different for returning students
this year. Members of the Physi-
cal Plant were busy over the sum-
merrepairing and adding to many
of the buildings on campus.

Besides general mainte-
nance, David Holthouser and
Davidson’s maintenance group
had to make changes to comply
with Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) requirements.

Most noticeable are the
ramps added*to the outside of
Chambers. This was done in or-
der to make classrooms more ac-
cessible for handicapped students
and visitors who previously had
to enter through the rear entrance
across from the library.

A similar ramp has been
added to the guest house thanks

to a grant which was given to the
school by the Duke Foundation.
Also in response to ADA re-
quirements, Davidson has added
braille numbers to many of the
buildings, including all of the
dorms. This project, which has
been in the planning for over a
year, was put off until now because
of its immense scope and high cost.
Other colleges have been go-
ing through the same changes ful-
filling ADA policy. According to
Director of the Physical Plant Bob
Collins, the project was not com-
pleted earlier because “there’s a
tendency to wait and see how the
problem can be best addressed.”
The mostcost efficient method
Davidson found was to train its
own maintenance people in the
production and installation of these
signs. They began with a method
that required the use of two pieces
of plastic.
They felt this was the best

method because the pieces were
different colors and therefore
stood out.

The braille, however, was
easily scraped off, and the dots
had to.be replaced. In order to
minimize costs, the college came
up with a new process, one in
which only one piece of material
was used and the braille was in-
dented in the background piece.

This and most other work
this summer was done by David
Holthouser and his maintenance
group.

Along with changes made to
meet ADA requirements, the
school responded to faculty re-
quests to update classrooms.
Many rooms now have video pro-
jectors and other technological
advances.

Bob Collins believes that this
renovation is an ongoing process
and that “those classrooms will
be the first of many'to come.”
