THE MAGIC FORMULA

WINNING THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE crown
at the Charlotte Coliseum next weekend will be no mean
lask and though Davidson finally found the magic formulas
last year, suceess this vear will certainly represent 2 tre.
mendous comeback from the mid-season stump which
overtook the ‘Cats and sent hopes of a 20-win season
winging up to freshman practice.

FOR DAVIDSON, the path to » glory could te made
considerably smoother if Richmond beats William and
Mary tomorrow night in Willlamsburg, The loser falls
into West Virginia's bracket, and with a team so erratic
could bea! Davidson, but lose to Furman and
VMI all in the same week, Davidson should prefer to meet
Richmond a game in which the "Cats would have a defi.
nite height advantage.

Another problem to bringing the truphy and nets back
fo where they have spent the past year is the first game
which will be against Furman or George Washington. As-
suming Furman is seventh, here is another team which
has given Davidson two ‘ood games, or rather a good
game and a good first half, and hoes the ability to pull a
major upset.

Speaking of upsets, look for William and Mary to be
jal first division team to succumb. With o season
like theirs, if they get past the first round, they are the

Sometimes ane can find parallels which might give

remember, West Virginia lost down here last year and
then beat us in the return game at Charleston. Last time
was the first time thal the tournament game represented
a rubber match and Davidson pulled it out. The only other
lime thot situation occured was In 1963-64 but the ‘Cats
never were able to meet West Virginia in the finale. This
year the scene is sel for the rematch and the only chance
of meeting the Mounties is in the finals. But we have to
get there.

Another parallel. Richmond was our second
