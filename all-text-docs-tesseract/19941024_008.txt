Gull’s Nest: Bill Gullan

How Fall Break renewed my faith in America and in our generation

I can’t honestly say that I had
enough time to be genuinely de-
pressed before Fall Break, but the
abiding patriotism that has influ-
enced my opinions on things was
beginning to fade as we were in the
midst of two foreign policy opera-
tions: one to restore a weak anti-
American in Haiti, and the other to
boost the popularity of our sagging
President.

Let me quickly share an ob-
servation about the Caribbean situ:

of people we want here? I say give
them a Coke, a Big Mac, and the
oath of citizenship right there on
the beach. This in mind, I was
definitely in a malaise.

Fall Break has always been
fun. Freshman year had me being
enthusiastically greeted at the air-
port by an old girlfriend. Last year
saw forty ingenious Davidsonians,
fraudulently under the auspices of
an FCA chapter, renting a mansion
in rural Tennessee and converting
it into a big cooler of beer, Fun

they were, but this Fall Break te-
newed my faith in America, her
inhabitants, and our future.

We stocked up at Dover’s and
hit the road. Oh how joyful it was
knowing that up the road someone
was coming home from a dead end
job, going 67, and nervously look-

Either way, we were having
fun driving towards Morehead City
to meet the gypsies, tramps, and
thieves who comprised the rest of
our group (and who had followed
the directions more carefully and
were angrily pacing the street out-
side Carrie’s beach house upon

One of the members of our
party, whose weekend would cer-
tainly fit Art Flagg’s definition of
binge drinking, provided constant
amusement for the group with his
battles against the stairs to the beach
and his struggle with simple spell-
ing and pronunciation. Another

the long drive like
tired cats. Carrie, who preferred
notto sit next to me, was beginning
to snooze in the back, as was Matt;
but Beth, our driver, and I were
determined to prevent boredom:
she by passing alot of cars, and I by
enjoying steady doses of Michelob
Light and Marlboro Reds. Regret-
tably, Beth would eventually lose
interest in passing cars and begin
to pass exits, missing ours by a full

that Friday night, 15 college kids,
in the prime of our lives, settled
into a spacious beachfront Shangri-
la, with nothing to do but drink and
do beach stuff.

And that’s essentially what we
did. There were epic spades

next CD, ill-conceived romantic
encounters, and heated games of

in mounting a lit candle on his
baseball cap, an achievement the
dexterity of which was only
matched by my mastery of peel-
and-eat shrimp. Anyhow, you get
the picture: stupid revelry occurred
and a good time was had by all.
So where does America fit
into all this? The answer is simple:
the right to be dumb and embar-
rassing was exercised constantly
by our group. We had not acare in

the world. Not only did the group
impress me with its unconscious
rejection of being lumped in with
the tormented Generation X, but
none of us even encountered one
unlikable person of any genera-
tion. The evening-news America
of gangs, guns, hatred, and squalor
seemed to be worlds away. Even
the typical redneck, whom we nois-
ily accosted to take our final beach
group picture, smiled his toothless
grin and asked us to say “sex” on
the count of three.

So, we, the future leaders of
America, hada good time on break.
And I, while admiring the glorious
sunset and waiting for the shrimp
to boil and the kegs to arrive, had
an epiphany. No matter what they
say, America has nothing to worry
about from us. Should one of us
win the White House, he or she
might not solve all the world’s
problems, but we would definitely
give our nation one helluva hang-
over and a model for the enjoy-
ment of life.

Body image:
more than a
reflection

She moved to our school in sixth
grade. Tall and thin with dark,
long curls and bright green eyes,
she immediately mesmerized ev-
eryone. We became fast friends;
thrilled that she wanted my com-
pany, I wentout and bought Reebok
hightops so I could be just like her.

She excelled inthe classroom.
She dominated student activities. I
would walk proudly beside her,
beaming that she was my friend.

Everything changed in eighth
grade. Slowly; she began to wither
away. I’deat anextra cheese sand-
wich at lunch, gulp down a Pepsi
while she sipped on water and
nibbled at carrots, all the while
complaining about how full she
felt. My beautiful best friend was
hurting herself, and I had no idea
how to help her. As her cheeks
sunk in, her spirit faded, and fi-
nally, she was hospitalized.

No one told me what to say or
how to handle it. Instead, the par-
ents would whisper and hope we
didn’t hear, so we, too, wouldn’t
“get an eating disorder.” I remem-
ber thinking back then, in between
our awkward hospital visits, that it
wasn’t something she just “got.”
The anorexia wasn’t in a drink or
bite of food she had eaten after
somebody else. It was something
that evolved in her as she heard
certain stereotypes and continu-
ally received praise for her deli-
cate frame. She believed that thin-
ness was an integral part of her
identity, as important as her intel-
ligence or kindness.

She has been hospitalized
many times in the last eight years.
Every few months, her health spi-
rals down into some incredibly
dangerous state, and she leaves her
prestigious university to receive

treatment and counseling. She is
no better, unfortunately,.but those
of us around her are.

I’ve learned you can never
begin too early with the discussion
of body image. It is the failure of
anyone to speak to her in those key
years of development that harmed
her the most—years when who she
was exteriorly factored into her
identity greatly. Ifeveryone hadn’t
tried so desperately to hide the
demon of eating disorders from us
so we wouldn’t get any “crazy
ideas,” perhaps we would: have
been better prepared when we be-
gan to evaluate our own bodies.
Instead, we saw it as some great
evil, and we became too aware of
what we were eating. In the years
that followed, almost all of us de-
scended down into dangerous eat-
ing patterns. We couldn’t have
just learned with her.

I realized finally what our
greatest fault had been with her
and each other. We reinforced

thinness—not just thinness, but -

emaciation.

“T wish I was as thin as you,”
we would say. Those words went
deeper than any “Good job on that
test” we had ever muttered.

We rewarded each other for
having small appetites, for exer-
cising incessantly. We began to
think that womanhood was reached
in numbers, and the smaller your
numbers were, the more of a
woman you really were. We aug-
mented the belief that women
should be petite and delicate.

What could we have done dif-
ferently? At that age, when we
were all somewhat awkward, per-
