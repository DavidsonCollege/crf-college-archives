POLAND: Police force increased
last weekend to control demon-
strations by independent: groups
supporting Solidarity in Cracow
and other cities. Since February
6th, the day that talks began be-
tween the government and Po-
land’s banned trade union, “anti-
communist” groups have pro-
tested. Lech Walesa has been
encouraging supporters of Soli-
darity to abandon violent gather-
ings so that the union may accom-
plish its goals peacefully at the

negotiating table. ,

SOUTH. AFRICA:. 14-year-old
activist Stompie Moeketsi was
buried February 25. His.body was
found near Soweto. Two of Win-
nie Mandela’s bodyguards have
been blamed for Moeketsi’s mur-
der. There is some dissention
within the anti-apartheid move-
ment as to the circumstances of
the death. The imprisoned Nelson
Mandela met with his wife on
Monday and urged her to make no
more public statements concern-
ing the incident.

‘ Foreign

EL SALVADOR: President
Napoleon Duarte submitted a
proposal to El Salvador’s legisla-
ture that would have postponed
the presidential elections sched-
uled for next month. Duarte
pushed for a six-week delay in an
effort to obtain a cease-fire be-
tween the military and rebels so
that direct negotiations may res-
ume. Thé proposal would have
finalized the FDR/FMLN’s ef-
forts to'seek change through po-
litical channels instead of mili-
tary struggle. It was rejected by
the legislature.

EGYPT: During a five-country
tour of the Middle East, Soviet
Minister Eduard
Shevardnaze restated his pro-
posal that the United States and
the Soviet Union mutually with-
draw their naval ships from the
Persian Gulf. Shevardnaze ac-
cused President Bush of “promot-
ing superpower rivalry”
Middle East and suggested. that
the administration follow-a path
of “cooperative diplomacy.”

Trustees meet, cover. range of topics

"By PETE MANGONE

This past weekend Davidson’s .

board of trustees met on the
Davidson campus for their annual

._ winter gathering. Although their

presence was much, less publi-
cized than. their last visit which
dealt with the football contro-
versy, they, made some important
decisions concerning the budget,
tuition, fundraising, athletics, and
new members.

Most importantly, the trustees
approved next year’s budget of
$32.179 million, almost a 9%
increase over last year’s budget of
$29.581 million. According to
Jerry Stockdale, director of Col-
lege Relations, the increased
costs are due to a “compensation
adjustment pool” for all college
employees, increased financial

aid for students and start-up costs:

for new programs and buildings
(such as the Baker Sports Com-
plex).

Unfortunately for students, the

budget also contains an 11% in- .

crease in tuition for next year,
thus driving the tuition up from
this year’s total of $9,790 to
$10,867 for next year.
Conceming athletics, the trus-
tees approved a resolution mak-
ing Davidson women’s soccer a
varsity sport next year. The

team’s schedule has not been en-
' tirely determined yet. The money

for the team, which has garnereda
large amount of support this past
year, was approved in next year’s
budget. In addition, the trustees
are expecting to hear a report in
the spring on Davidson’s status
concerning Title LX regulations,
Finally, the trustees held elec-

Stroessner left the country Febru-
ary Sth after a coup ended his 35-
year reign, but enthusiasm over
prospects for democracy has
dwindled among citizens. Presi-
dent Andres Rodriguez, the
leader of the coup that overthrew
Stroessner, has vowed “‘to shep-
herd the nation toward democ-
racy.” He faces a poor country
that under Stroessner existed on
smuggling, counterfeit goods and
drug trafficking. Violence, how-
ever, is minimal. Although Ro-
driguez is a member of the Colo-

rado Party, Stroessner’: S Own po-
litical regime, his ministers are
interested in reforming electoral
laws that give the opposition
more opportunities in the elec-
tion. Opposition leaders have
asked the government to postpone
elections and may nominate their
own candidate.

WESTERN EUROPE: Secretary
of State James Baker toured
NATO-allied countries last
month expressing the United
States’s desire to modernize the
short-range nuclear Lance missle.

"aah ae par

While Prime Minister Thatcher .
approved of the plan to replace
the Lance with a 450 km range

’ missile, West German Chancellor

Helmut Kohl expressed reluc-
tance for modernization. There is
a strong public opposition which
is calling for additional talks with
the Soviet Union for the removal
of short-range weapons. On the
other hand, France expressed
interest in cooperative efforts in
military practices and the procur-
ing of alternative weapons to the
Lance.
