PEAKS QUNDAY

Two Thousand Persons Gather
At Charlotte Auditorium
Sunday Afternoon

R. L. OWNBEY PRESIDES

400th Anniversary of English
Printed Bible Inaugurated

Dr. W. L. Lingle, president of Da-
vidson college, delivered the address at
the celebration Of the 400th anniversary
of the printing of the Bible in the Eng-
lish language before two thousand per-
sons gathered at the Charlotte Armory-
Auditorium last Sunday afternoon.

The meeting was under the auspices of
the Mecklenburg Ministerial Association,
with Dr. R. L. Ownbey, president of this
associgtion, presiding. The Davidson col-
lege band under the leadership of Prof.
James Pfohl rendered several hymns, and
a capella choir of Central High school
sang the Hallelujah chorus.

Rev. W. H. Frazer, president of
Queens Chicora college, introduced Dr.
Lingle, who spoke on the “History and
Influence of the English Bible.” The
speaker traced the origin of the Bible,
beginning with Moses, 500 years before
Christ, and closing with John, 100 years
after the death of Christ. He said that
the Bible had been translated into Greek
before the time of Christ, and the New
Testament was written in Greek.

Dr. Lingle said the first English scrip-
tures were written by Venerable Bede in
735 A.D., and King Alfred translated
some more of the Bible in 900. John Wy-
cliff presented the Anglo-Saxon version
in 1383, while in 1525, William Tyndale
translated the New Testament into Eng-
lish and printed it. Ten years later Miles
Coverdale published the first complete
printed translation of the Bible into Eng-
lish,

The minister stated that the Bible had
a great influence in English history, and
cited several vivid examples showing the
truth of his statement. Many American
writers use the Bible as a background
for their works.

He attributed the backbone of the
moral character of the English speaking
people to their study of God’s word. The
Puritan movement found its rise in the
Bible, and the settlement of North
America was due to the search for God.

Dr. Lingle closed with a description
of the spiritual power of the Bible, which,
he said, meant more than literary and
moral influence. His last words were “the
Bible needs no defense, all we need to do
is to preach it, to read it, and bring it
into the lives of our children.”

French Club Members

Give Play At Meeting

In the last meeting of Le Cercle Fran-
cais, held Tuesday night, November 19th,
at Dr. Watts’ home, business matters of
the club were discussed and this was
followed by a scene from the French
play Knock,

The part of Knock, the doctor, was
played by Val Cassels and his two pa-
tients were Ralph McClelland and Sam
Cothran. Following the play, refresh-
ments were served by Mrs. Watts, and
with the singing of a few French songs,
the meeting was adjourned.

The next meeting will be held at 7:00
P. M., Tuesday night the seventeenth.
The meeting will be featured by the
reading of a French scriptural story by
Henry Eve, a French narrative by Jim
Cothran and a double quartet, directed
by Val Cassels, featuring Frank Tucker
as soloist. The string ensemble will furn-
ish the music for the French Club
Christmas: Finale.~Dr.- Watts will relate
some French stories and Professor
Bailey will render a few piano selections.

Proposed trips to Winthrop, Converse,
N.C.C.W., and possibly Greensboro Col-
lege are planned for the after Christmas
program. The details are not yet com-
plete but the cast including Wade Bar-
row, Mrs. Grier Martin, Frank Poe,
Woodrow Hassel, Dick Vowles, and oth-
ers, will soon begin rehearsals on the
play.

Thrilling 0-0 Tie

The Wildcats soccer team was
held to a scoreless tie by the Duke
Blue Devils in a rough, exciting game
played here Tuesday afternoon. The
Wildcats scrapped until the final
whistle and threatened to score
but lacked the final
punch to push it through. The un-
coached and unsupported Wildcats
fought the highly touted Dukes in
truly traditional style and all the
spectators agreed that they deserve
