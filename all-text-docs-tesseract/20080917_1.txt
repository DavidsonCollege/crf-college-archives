Presidential ads
spark controversy

Cuint SMITH
Staff Writer

In a statement that took many
political experts by surprise and
seemed drenched in irony, former
Bush advisor Karl Rove claimed
that the McCain campaign has gone
“one step too far” with some of his
recent attack ads against Demo-
cratic presidential nominee Barack
Obama.

Rove did, however, also level
similar claims against the Obama
campaign.

“McCain has similarly gone one
step too far, attributing to Obama
things that are, you know, beyond
the 100% truth test.” Rove said in
an interview with Chris Wallace on
Fox News Sunday.

The Obama campaign jumped
on the quote and immediately is-
sued a strong statement that was
sent to the media moments after
Rove’s startling comments.

“In case anyone was still won-
dering whether John McCain is
running the sleaziest, most dishon-
est campaign in history, today Karl
Rove — the man who held the pre-
vious record — said McCain’s ads
have gone too far,’ Obama cam-
paign spokesman Tommy Vietor
said.

Karl Rove is considered by
many to be the infamous archi-
tect of George W. Bush’s 2000
and 2004 presidential campaigns,
where attack ads were frequently
run against both his primary and
general election opponents.

Rove’s cutthroat tactics have
been criticized by Democrats and
Republicans alike, to the point
where negative ads run during an
election at any level are often re-
ferred to as “Karl Rove politics.”

Rove said that both candidates
should be extremely cautious with
their attacks on one another, claim-
ing “that there ought to be an adult
who says, ‘Do we really need to go
that far in this ad? Don’t we make
our point and won’t we get broader
acceptance and deny the opposi-
tion an opportunity to attack us if
we don’t include that one little last
tweak in the ad?”

Both campaigns have recieved-
harsh criticism for their negative

Kappa Alpha Psi Chapter
chartered at Davidson

ALEX KOWALESK!

Staff Writer

A new fraternity, Kappa Alpha
Psi, has been chartered by Davidson
College. Kappa Alpha Psi, founded
in 1911 at Indiana University, is a
historically black fraternity open to
men of all race, ethnicity and be-
lief. Its membership currently ex-
ceeds 150,000, with 700 chapters
worldwide.

Although Davidson students
have joined this fraternity in the
past, chartering allows Kappa Al-
pha Psi to hold official functions on
campus. The leaders of the frater-
nity are President D.J. Singleterry
’09, Vice President Elliot Campbell
"11 and Treasurer Brandon Giles
09.

Receiving charter permission
from President Tom Ross entailed
significant cooperation between
Kappa Alpha Psi and the Davidson
administration.

“We found this current adminis-
tration very accepting,” Giles said.
“The biggest problem was con-
vincing the entire community that
we were unlike other fraternities
here...proving we could provide
for the whole community was the
biggest obstacle.”

Campbell agreed. “We look at
all aspects of life,” he said. “Our
sole purpose is to enlighten people
on issues people don’t talk about
and to raise awareness about these
issues.”

The fundamental purpose of
Kappa Alpha Psi is achievement
in every field of human endeavor.
The fraternity plans an ambitious
fall schedule toward achieving their
goals.

On Thurs., August 28, the fra-
ternity gave away carnations to fe-
males to welcome the student body
back to campus.

This Saturday, Kappa Alpha
Psi will hold the Kappa Cooloff, a
free cookout, at 4:30pm outside the
Union atrium.

“We want to encourage every-
one to come out to the cookout...
well-cooked, all you can eat,”
Campbell said.

Community service and politi-
cal awareness are also high on the
fraternity’s agenda. Members of
Kappa Alpha Psi are already in-

volved in the Guide Right Program -

at Ada Jenkins every Monday, tu-

_ toring young students and helping

them with homework, as well as
serving as role models for the stu-
dents.

" Starting at. the Cooloff and
throughout the next week, Kappa
Alpha Psi will be selling boxes of
Krispy Kreme doughnuts to raise
money for the St. Jude Foundation,
a children’s research hospital which
fights pediatric cancer.

On October 30, at 7:30 p.m.,
the fraternity will sponsor a 2008
election forum, with Dr. Roberts,
Dr. Aldridge, representatives from
College Republicans and Young
Democrats and a fraternity mem-
ber. The focus of the forum will be
on issues important to college stu-
dents.

In November, Kappa Alpha Psi
will continue activities in the spirit
of its fundamental purpose, help-
ing Davidson students learn finan-
cial responsibility and how to save
money through G-L-A-D, Greeks
Learning to Avoid Debt.

The leaders of Kappa Alpha Psi
appreciate support they have re-
ceived from the school so far.

“We want to let everybody, es-
pecially the college administration,
know that we are very glad to be on
campus and are thankful for the op-
portunity,” Campbell said.

Giles agreed. stating, “This year
we were given a chance and are not
holding back.”

Freshmen

experience First
Night Down

KE.ty BEGGS
Staff Writer

Every year, after three weeks
of collegiate maturation, David-
son’s freshmen are deemed ready
to discover a new part of campus:
Martin and Patterson Court. After
spending nearly a month cooped up
in dorm-room parties, hiding from
hall counselors and on-duty RLO,
freshmen are officially allowed to
take their epic walk down the hill
for First Night Down and to fi-
nally vocalize the question that’s
been plaguing them since day one:
“Where’s F?”

While First Night Down is an
event that generally focuses on
freshmen, the Patterson Court-sea-
soned seniors began Friday night
behind F with a “Last First Night
Down Luau” sponsored by Cam-
pus Police and RLO. Temporarily
exchanging their police badges for
brightly patterned Hawaiian shirts,
the campus police grilled burgers
and hot dogs to celebrate the Class
of 2009’s fourth and final First
Night.

As the pre-parties started,
freshmen came down the hill in
what Chief of Campus Police
Fountain Walker characterized as
“troops” with as many as 40 in a
single group. Traveling in packs is
always an inherent characteristic of
freshmen, but this year, according
to Chief Walker, the herd mental-
ity was even more pronounced. He
said that the tune “When Johnny
comes marching home” kept play-
ing in his head as he watched hoards
of freshmen stream down the hill.

Walker explained that “Our job
is to watch after students’ safety,
and also to enforce the law with re-
spect to the environment we’re in.”
This college-campus-sensitive law
enforcement becomes problematic
“when a large group of people en-
masse descend upon Martin Court
to engage in illegal drinking in front
of the police.” As a result of the
blatant underage drinking that took
place last weekend, many freshmen
