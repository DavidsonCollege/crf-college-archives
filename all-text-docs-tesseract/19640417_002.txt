A Flurry Of Confetti

A plethora of platforms stealthily
posted on the walls in heads and halls
across the campus distinguished this
year’s political sweepstakes—for its
industry, at least. The approach was
new, if unexciting. for Davidson.

Further, deadpan Davidson politics
got a shot in the arm from darkhorse
Ed Boston’s “New Tradition,” and
his happv-days-are-here-again chapel
address. This could be the start of
something grand, as the song goes.

But as the season wore on, and the
candidates studiously paraphrased
each other, the tedious sea of mimeo-
graphy overcame the public. The flut-
tering signals of progress became
something more than trash but less
than information. One conscientious
voter accepted his duty as he saw it.
methodically and tirelessly burning
every one of the platforms posted in
Richardson dormitory in an effort to
preserve the eyesight and sanity of
his fellows.

Third and fourth round candidates
waxed imaginative. using brightly
colored magic markings to draw in a
sucker or two. But the manifestoes re-
mained a cut below the high school
campaign poster, in interest if not in
sophistication. The flicker of progress
was smothered under a blanket of
suffocating typewritten verbiage.

Fraternity brothers and friends of
the candidates watched their favorite
sons go down in quiet gloom. Support
for ideas ran silent, but not necessar-
‘fly deep. A misinterpretation of the
bloc-voting restriction caused frater-
nity fireballs to shy away from soli-
citing around their respective hearths.
The rule prohibits inter-fraternity
bloc-vote swapping and forbids coer-

cion “for the sake of the brother-
hood.” But taking the fraternity to
the polls en masse is simply good
politics.

The issues this year were not great;
but neither was the ostensible ambi-
tion. Politics at Davidson could mean
something if we wanted it to—if
candidates believed in themselves
enough to be aggressive,

The lead in aggressive campaigning
belongs to the capable friends and
supporters of office-seekers. Modesty
is no qualification for a politician, but
it shouldn’t be even a consideration
for the political well-wisher. Soap-box
rhetoric on the Union steps, rallies at
the Post Office after chapel, im-
promptu debate between rival sup-
porters wherever a crowd will gather;
anything can go to focus attention on
your candidate.

At larger schools, convincing cam-
paigns are conducted successfully with
a negligible monetary expense. A $25-
a-plate barbecue isn’t the only way to
buttonhole voters. And a Monday
morning assembly isn’t the only aud-
lence for the political hopeful. Any-
body can play, but only one can win;
and the winner is usually the one who
reaches the most voters.

Well, the first time is the hardest,
and Davidson will laugh up its madras
sleeve on the first round of stump-
Standing oration. But grassroots cam-
paigning, conducted by campus poli-
ticos and respected upperclassmen.
can smoke out some issues and liven
up a bland Davidson spring. It re-
quires some effort to read a platform.
but it doesn’t even take much sense

The ‘Representatives’ Act

Leaping into action at its first
meeting, the newly elected Student
Council voted to oppose the attempt
by Mississippi state officials to revoke
the charter of Tougaloo College, a
private, predominantly Negro school.
The action on the part of the Missis-
sippi officials finds its roots in. the
state’s racial problem.

- An intensive campaign in Touga-
loo’s behalf has been waged in recent
weeks by the United States National
Student Association (NSA) and the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP).

On the basis of the limited informa-
tion available. we agree with the
council’s opinion on the Tougaloo
charter action.

Nevertheless, we strongly protest
the decision of the members of coun-
ci] to participate in this, a political
matter, as a group rather than as in-
dividuals. Although academic matters
are involved in the Tougaloo case,
nevertheless, the problem remains es-
sentially political, a product of ‘Missis-
‘sippi’s racial struggie.

In answering a DAVIDSONIAN poll
of candidates for the student body
presidency last month, then-candidate
Will Jackson wrote:

I do not believe that the Student Council
should take official stands on specific poli-
tical issues of the day. It seems that an
interesting parallel on this subject can be
drawn toward the past actions of the NSA.
Much criticism has been aimed at NSA for
formulating official stands on national or
international political issues which are es.

Mrs. M.

In the wake of Mrs. Moore’s deci-
sion to resign as Supervisor of Dormi-
tories, we find a position that will be
difficult to fill at all and impossible
to fill as well.

We are not losing merely a Super-
visor of Dormitories; leaving is a per-
son who has served in the amazing
capacity of confidant—administrator
— motherfather — hostess — dean
— liaison.

Exhausting are the duties of such
a multi-lateral position. But with the
position goes the pleasure of success,
a success which has come primarily
from Mrs. Moore's contact with stud-
ents. With keen interest she daily has
demonstrated her discerning under-
standing of students and their prob-
lems. Partially through the nature of

sentially outside the realm of specific stud-
ent affairs and problems. I think that much
of this criticism is validly founded. In the
same sense, then, I feel that the Student
Council's role on this campus is directly
dedicated to the welfare of the student body
and its rightful representation in student
affairs, and that political stands. are neither
logically within this scope nor consistent
with this aim.

Council member Tommy Heffner,
responding to the same poll, stated:

I do not think the Student. Council should
itake political stands. In the first place, that
is not the role of a student government as
ft exists here. Furthermore, I can't see
how the council could adequately represent
student opinion on most political issues
where so many diverse opinions are held.
It would be difficult to draw the line and
say just what sort of political issues the.
council would take stands on and exactly
how far it would go. Also this seems to be
something that would take up time which
the council could better devote to matters
more pertinent to the students.

Surely the Student Council should
reconsider its action in view of the
precedent being established.

We encovfrage student participa-
tion in political affairs. But such ac-
tivity should be carried out by the
student either as an individual or
through a politically. oriented organi-
zation. We had hoped that the newly
elected councilmen would be more
interested in implementating _ their
platforms than in seeking . methods
by which the student support behind
council might be split.

her position, but even more because
of her individual efforts, she has suc-
ceeded where many others have fail-
ed — in spanning the hiatus with
students.

Only Mrs. Moore knows the name
of every student by the first of Octo-
ber; and only Mrs. Moore knows what
makes each Davidson man “tick” by.
the end of his freshman year. It is this
interest and understanding that has
won for her the admiration of the
student body to which she has devot-
ed herself for the past seven years.

Sadness will confront us next year
as we await — yet fail to hear — the
sound of the familiar short steps ac-
companied by the lightly tossed warn-
ing of “Mrs. Moore on the hal

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Workman Cites Need
For Sexual Restraint

Dear Editor:

I. wish to commend Duncan
Newcomer for a lucid expres-

‘sion of a point of view in ‘‘An

Urchin's Way‘ in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN,

Such expressions as his are
essential if there is to be a pro-
fitable dialog between the gen-
erations (to a great extent. con-
flicts of morals are conflicts
between the generations). There
must be an effort at just as
lucid an expression from the
other side.

Honesty, like Mother and
Flag. must be admired and
eulogized: but, as one of our
vesper speakers two or three
years ago said about sincerity.
honesty can be a half-virtue.
Honesty is necessary. yes: but
it is not sufficient. To admit to
having a passion or a drive is
honest’ (and also healthy): to
act as the passion or drive di-
reots is neither honest nor dis-
honest in itself.

For example, if | am tempt-
ed to steal, it is honest to
acknowledge the temptation,
but can ! justify stealing by
saying that it is an honest ex-
pression of my desire? (1 am
defining stealing as taking
possession of property with-
out due process.) There are
processes by which [| can
legitimately gain possession.
Sex, tke possession, is not
good or bad in itself; circum-
stances provide the ethical
quality.

For a second example: I have
a genuine desire to tell a lie: is
telling the lie, then, an honest
act?

Another point. more pragma-
tic: in my counseling exper-
ience I have found the following
case not unusual. A student
comes to me considerably dis-
turbed. deeply remorseful, feel-
ing heavy guilt. He has been in
love, the love was mutual, and
the love was experienced as
eternal. The love justified sex
as an honest expression of the
whole relationship of two per-
sons, the fusion of two spirits.
What need was there for ‘‘the
incantations of a priest. for the
mumbo-jumbo of a medicine
man”? (That quotation is al-
most verbatim from more than
one client.)

Now it has turned out that
the love was not eternal. Now
at least one (often it is onty
one) of the former lovers feels
naked and alone, unsupported
in @ loveless world; his (the
ones who have come to me
have been men) act of love is
left unsanctioned; neither the
society of which he is a part
and on which he is to an ap-
preciable degree dependent
nor a great, enduring love
undergirds him.

While we are thinking about
the virtue of honesty, we should
not neglect to recognize the vir-

tue of restraint. Maybe they are
both half-virtues, and maybe
together they make a _ pretty
valuable whole.

Dear Editor:
Several important points

should be noted in reference to
rast week's editorial concerning
the Student Council-Honor Court
room check for missing library
books:

First. the plan for the check
was clearly announced weeks in
advance by the DAVIDSON-
IAN, ana a later issue of the
paper stated that the Student
Counci! had set a definite date
for the action. Thus, the check
should have been a surprise to
no one, and objections, if any,
could have been voiced prior to
the actual search.

Yet, to our knowledge, no
one expressed any official
complaint or objection § to
either the Student Council or
the Honor Court.

Secondly, the search was
hardly conducted as a “‘blitz-
krieg."" as you so vividly de-
scribed. The check was quiet
and orderly, and permission to
enter and search was requested
and granted in every room
where an occupant was present.

In those rooms in which there
was no occupant, the members
of the Student Council and Hon-
or Court entered and, with the
door plainly open, checked all
obviously visible books on
shelves, desks, or beds.

Thirdly. at no time were the
Court and Council members in-
volved in “rummaging through
the rooms of students,’’ as you
stated. Only those books ex-
hibited in open places were ex-
amined, and places such as
drawers, trunks, or boxes were
not disturbed at all.

Fourth, as you stated in
your editorlai, “we admit that
in certain situations such as
the Ilbrary problem, a search
is the only answer.” We main-
tain that the Honor Court and
Student Council do possess
the authority to search rooms
on this campus when a parti-
cular situation merits such an
investigation, and that this
authority is expressly under-
stood in the roles and func-
tlons of these Student Govern-
ment organizations.

It is our opinion that the li-
brary circumstances in question
did indeed merit such a search,
and that search was car-
ried out tactfully. and with as
little inconventence to the Stud-
ent Body as was possible.

BY STEPHEN GRAHAM

Governor George Wal-
lace’s “victory” in the Wis-
consin primary, insofar as
it is representative of na-
tional sentiment on the
Civil Rights Bill, is insignifi-
cant.

Wisconsin presidential _ pri-
maries are anathema to pro-
fessional politicians. The politi-
cal reforms of Robert La Fol-
lette and his Progressive Re-
publicans may have cleaned
out bosses and political ma-
chines, but they have also play-
ed havoc with effective party
organization in that state.

Undoubtedly the unique cross
primary (in which party mem-
bership obligations are not
binding at the polls and which
California junked after a short
trial) contributed to Wallace's
obtaining twenty-five percent of
the popular vote.

But Wisconsin’s stringent
election laws go beyond the

cross primary. Incorporated

By Wallace In Wisconsin

tegal party machinery is for-
bidden, patronage is almost
non-existent, political adver-
fising and radio and televis-
jon broadeasts are taboo
twenty-four hours before elec-
tion time, and ao candidate
can hire cars to take voters to
the polls or pay poll workers.

These conditions have. helped
to produce such national anom-
alies and political surprises as
Joe McCarthy and the begin-
ning of the end for the Presi-
demial aspirations of Hubert
Humphrey in 1960. The vestiges
of McCarthyism also helped
Alabama's excellent showing in
the late Senator's old district.

To what then can Wallace's
rather substantiai vote be at-
tributed? The answer may well
lie in the fact that Wallace did
well indeed in traditionally Re-
publican districts, where Wal-
lace was associated with the
conservative reaction to power-
ful government and its activi-
ties.

in this light Wallace can be
viewed as a front man for an-
other more prominent, but
Republican, candidate—Bar-
ry Goldwater. The vote for —
Wallace would thus seem to —
stem from the extreme con-
servative Republicanism in
Wisconsin and not from popu-
lar opposition to the Civil
Rights Bill. (The influence of
McCarthyism is obvious.)

In retrospect it would hardly
seem possible for Senators to be
greatly influenced by this up.
start nonentity from Alabama
in the erratic presidential pri-
maries of Wisconsin. The battle
lines have been formed, and the
fight for rights has already be-
gun. There can be no turning
back for the truly committed.

This last-ditch effort of the
adherents to a lost cause has
come a bit late, and having oc
curred as it did, seems futile,
foolish, and even a little farci-
cal.

Honor Court Policies
Defended By Arbuckle

In Regard to Search . .

Dear Edtor:

Insofar as Charles Dibble's
first editorial in the DAVID-
SONIAN issue of April 10, 1964,
entitled ‘‘A Search for the
Means. ... ",. he has misap-
plied the law of ‘‘search.”

The College in furnishing a
room for a student’s occupan-
cy reserves the right, either
by expressed contract or im-
plication, for access to that
room for any of its authoriz-
ed personnel or representa-
tives.

For instance, the janitors
have the right of entry to clean,
Mrs. Moore to inspect, and
maintenance to repair. Further-
more, the President and the
Dean of Students have recog-
nized the rightful authority of
the Student Council and the
Honor Court to apply this means
of search to a legitimate end.

Any suspected violation of
College rules and regulations
affords sufficient reason for
entry and search. Contrary to
Dibble’s and Loflin’s opinion
suspicion had arisen. This sus-
picion is not directed at any
particular persons but at the
college community as a whole.

Kt is a fact that even the
DAVIDSONIAN accepts that
student conduct in the Hbrary
has created an increasingly in-
tolerable situation.

The dorm check was ini-
tiated nof only to find viota-
ters and missing books, but
also was to fet the student
body know that the Honor
Court and Student Council are
interested in this problem and
plan to do more than pay lip
service in correcting this
problem.

It is a student problem and it
should be handled by students.
It is both Spratt’s and
my opinion that this check was
done not only in the best inter-
ests of the College but in the
best interests. of the student
body.

In his editorial Dibble used
such words as ‘blitzkrieg’,
“March 26 raid’, “‘indiscrimin-
ate searches”, etc.—all imply-
ing a misuse of power and will-
ful negligence and abuse of a
student's rights.

The dorm check (1.e. search)

Is a result of the Council and
Court asking permission to
settle a serious student prob-
lem without interference from
fhe administration. Both the
library and the Dean’s Office
felt this would be the best ap-
proach.

Several articles were written

about the problem and an ap..

peal to a students’ sense of hon-
or was made. It got little re-
sponse and it became evident
more active means must be em-
ployed.

A dorm check was decided
upon and this decision was
printed in the DAVIDSONIAN

some three or four weeks be-
fore the search.

A joint meeting of the Council
and Court decided on the pro-
cedure to be used. It was un-
derstood that there would be no
“rummaging through the rooms
of students’’ or into their pri-
vate belongings. The search
was directed toward bookselves.

There was also to be no forci-
ble entry. If a student did not
want his room entered, Court
and Council members were to
comply with his request.

The procedure suggested by
Charles Dibble would be appii-
cable only to a student's private
possessions which have been
secured by lock. For instance, a
student's trunk could not prop-
erly be broken open without his
consent or without good grounds
for believing he was secreting
therein something contrary to
College regulations, such as
stolen property.

In making. a search of this
nature all necessary safeguards
should be followed and Dibble’s
suggestion might well be appli-
cable, It is not, however, appli-
cable to a room furnished a
student by the College the use
of which is subject to the pleas-
ure of the College, and to the
rules and regulations of the Col-
lege.

The Council and Court acted
as agents of the College in an
attempt to regain College prop-
erty.

§ trust the above will help
clarify in some measure this
editorial which attempts to
treat a student’s room as his
“castle’, whereas the very
nature of his tenure make
inapplicable the safeguards
inherent in the “right of
search” as applied to private
Property.

I trust also that the students
will see the dorm check as an
acceptance of responsibility by

B.C.

YOu MEAN YOU HAVE

NOTHING To SAY ABour Racks:

the Council and Court to pro-
tect the students from continu.
ed misuse of the library.

As For Book Stealing . .

in the second editorial of
April 10. Dibble stated. ‘Part of.
the trouble the Student Council
and Honor Court are meeting in
the library book hullabaloo is a
direct result of the groups’
failure or refusal to recognize
the problem for what it is —
Stealing.”” I take objection to
this statement in three ways:

First, Dibble does not rea-
lize the undue strain this
broad statement would put on
the Honor System. tt is neces-
sary to reatize that if this vio-
lation were an honor offense,
it would make it an honor of-
fense not to report. There is.
the strain of reporting and not
fo mention the enforcing.

Second. the intent of the taker
is not being taken into account.
It is an oversimplification not
to consider intent, If intent is
not considered, it would be per
missable to dismiss someone
from college everytime a per-
son fails to sign a book out.

Thirdly, the Honor Court cor-
rectly applies the law when it
refuses to consider a theft of a
library book to have been com-
mitted unless coupled with the
taking there is something else
that would constitute wrongful
intent.

The removal or attempting
to remove the College’s iden-
tifying marks makes out
wrongful intent.

It is not essential that the
taker benefit from the taking.
but only that there ‘is present
something to evidence wrongful
intent—such as the intent to de-
prive the College permanently
of the book. The — significant
thing is that the taking must
be coupled with the additioral
element of intent.
