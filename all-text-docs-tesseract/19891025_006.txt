Those who wander into the wilder-
ness of Davidson College beyond Pat-
terson Court and all other signs of civi-
lization may be surprised to discover a
new type of wildlife besides the birds
and insects. This wildlife can be seen in
the form of dorm cookouts, “silly girl
parties,” carpools to Chambers and
mixers with freshmen halls. It is the
wildlife of nearly 90 sophomores and
their resident advisers who inhabit
Akers, Irwin and Knox dorms.

Those students who are participat-
ing in the infamous “sophomore year
abroad” describe their dorm location as
both a blessing and a curse. While some
claim that their residence here is simply
a reflection of “awful lottery numbers,”
others state that they specifically chose
these dorms.

“We chose to be down here to live
witha fun group of sophomores and to
get to know different people in our
class,” said Lesley Vauclain.

Mary Russcites “the overall bonding
experience of sophomore year abroad”
as the reason she and her friends chose
tolive down-campus. “I’m glad we did
it, even if we do end up driving to our
classes,” she adds.

Residents have found reasons other
than just camaradcrie and new friend-
ships to enjoy life down-campus. “It is
definitcly a more rclaxcd, quiet envi-
ronment down here,” stated Paul
Pritchett. Anadded bonus, according to
Missy Anderson, is the fact that “you
canleave yourroom messy because you

know very few people will make the

journcy to visit you!”

Most male residents say they have
few complaints, as they reside in the
only place oncampus witha five-to-one
female-to-male ratio. Unlike previous
years, all but the bottom floor of Akers
houses women. The men of first Akers

hope that this will help their social lives
a lot.

John Turner finds the situation ad-
vantageous in other ways: “It makesita
lot easier to get the chicks to do your
laundry,” he asserts.

Some tips and words of wisdom for
surviving life in the “wilderness”) of
Davidson College? “An answering
machine is key,” offers Glenn Kinken,
as a solution to the problem of never
being in his inconveniently-located
room.

Students have also found alternatives
to the long hike up-campus primarily
through carpools, bikes and occasion-
ally the dubious piggy-back ride. Most
would agree with Michelle Carswell
that “it will be a long, cold winter with-

out a good carpool system!”

As a junior survivor of SYA, Carey
Murrey reflected on her days of down-.
campus life: “I enjoyed it while I was
there, but I can definitely say that once
is enough!”

This sentiment will no doubt be ech-
oed next year when the 90 residents
return to central campus, with a new
appreciation for proximal locations,
stronger legs and, for the men, maybe
even clean laundry.
