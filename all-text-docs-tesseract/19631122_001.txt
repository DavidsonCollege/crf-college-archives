LBJ: A Texan Takes Reins

BY JIMMY DOWNEY

The 36th President of the
United States, Lyndon Baines
Johnson, was sworn in this af-
ternoon after the death of Prezi-
dent John Kennedy.

The new President was near
Kennedy in a separate car when
the assassin’s shots rang out but
was unharmed,

Gerving as Vice President un-
der Kennedy since 1081, John-
son, known popularly as LBJ,
now will take the reins of the
country as the chief executive.

Born near Stonewall, Texas, on
Aug. 27, 1008, LBJ is the eldest
son ef Samuel and Rebekah
Johnson, both of whose families
were pioneer families of cen-
tral Texas. He attended the
Blanko County schools in John-
son City and was graduated in
1924 from the town’s high
school.

By doing janitor’s work he
was able to attend the Southwest
Texas State Teachers College.

-He was graduated in 1930 and
became a public schoo! teacher
in Houston.

Two years tater Johnson
went to Washington, D. C. as
pecretary to Representative
Richard M. Kleberg, holding
this position until 1935. After
ae year at Georgetown Law
School in the capital, Johnson
became state director of the
National Youth Administra-
tlon of Texas. He resigned in
1937 to become ea candidate for
the House of Representatives
from the Tenth District of
Texes.

At the age of 29, LBJ received
the Democratic nomination to
fill the post left by the death
of James P. Buchanan. He ran
in the election on a platform
endorsing Roosevelt's policies,
including the Supreme Court
reorganization plan, and gained
a seat in the House.

Johnson represented his dis
trict for five terms, unopposed

in his election in. 1938. Three
days after the attack on|Peorl
Harbor, LBJ joined the US.
Navy and was commissioned a
lieutenant commander. Station-
ed in New Zealand and Austral-
ia, he saw action in the South
Pacific and was awarded the
Silver Star in mid-1942.

A member of the House Naval
Affairs Committee, Johnson in
1943 was named chairman of a
Naval investigating subcommit-
tee, serving in much the same
way as the Truman investigating
committee of World Wer II hai.

In 1048 the Texan announced
his candidacy for the United
States Senate. In a very close
and highly disputed election,
Johnson was declared the win-
ner in a case which went even-
tually to the Supreme Court.
The newly elected Senator was
made a member of the Senate

mittee and the Committee of

Student Council Weighs

Election Modifications

Devoting most
ent Council revised

of its time to discussion of the p:
several sections of the tentative by-laws changes an

to decide upon the proposals at a future meeting.

The modifications include the
tequirement that, “No student
shall be a candidate for Student
Council and Honor Court posi-
tions.” Also, “All candidates for
Freshman Advisor will auto-
matically be senior candidates
for the Student Council unless
the individual candidate spect
fies otherwise.”

Fred McGuirt brought forth a
motion that, “A candidate shall
tun either for a student body
office or Honor Court position
on the first day of elections, and
if defeated in both, he is then
eligible to run or a Student
Council position.” The motion
was defeated 7-5.

President John Spratt sug-
gested that the Elections
Boerd through the Student
Council should pay for a print-
ed statement by any cendi-
date who wishes, which would
outline that person’s stands
and aims in the election. A
decision will be reached on
this when the proposed

changes ere voted upon.
Spratt announced the replace-
ment of Hill Wellford by John
Barrow as Traffic Court Advisor
for this month.

Reporting on a trip to Raleigh,
Tom Frist and Fred Sackett gave
a resume of the National Stud-
ent Association conference at
N.C. State College over the past
weekend. The 310-179 victory
which insured the permanence
of NSA on the campus for at
least a few more months was
briefly reviewed.

At the Student-Faculty Con-
ference Committee meeting
yesterday Spratt brought vp
the problem of seating David-
son students at the Charlotte
Coliseum basketball games. At
present the seats are behind
the goals at $1 per student.
He ennounced at the Student
Council meeting thet action
would be taken in this matter
and that the students were
certainly entitled to some of
the better seats without pay-

roposed election changes, the Stud-

determined

ing the high reguler prices.

Also discussed at the Thurts-
day meeting was the possibility
of keeping the gymnasium open
until 11 p.m. on school nights
to enable greater use of the
facilities. Dr. Tom Scott's main
objection is tat his help is al-
ready overworked and that he
doesn’t want to lay upon them
the extra burden of tending the
gym at night. To this Spratt sug-
gested that students be in
charge of the gym at night and
operate without the help of the
regular daytime assistants.

The Student-Faculty Commit-
tee also discussed the possibility
of forming a group for the re-
ception of distinguished speak-

ers like Premier Nagy. Mention.

was made of some apparent
lack of planning concerning cir-
cumstances of his arrival.

The Student Council will take
a recess next Monday and re-
sume its duties with a meeting
on Dec. 2.

Hungarian Ex-P.M. Meets

Many Queries From Few

BY GREG GOVAN

Perhaps because Ferenc Nagy came without a bodyguard and a battery of re-
porters no one thought him important. Or perhaps Davidson suffers from a glut of
ex-prime ministers who come with something to say.

Whatever the reason, there
was hardly a frenzy of enthus-
jasm over his presence on cam-
pus; of the sleepy throngs in

to the “lecture” that evening.
Host Will Terry was looking
somewhat apologetic.

EX-PM Ferenc Negy pauses in snalysis of the &

was a somewhat dry affair, for
not too many Davidsonians have
lived through a Communist
menace face to face, so not too
many are interested in the ab-
Stract expression of a modern
foe from the north.

But in the informal groups,
Nagy was not a political polemi-
cist. He was the prime minister
of Hungary who traded his resig-

nation to the Communists for
the life of his four-year-old son
in a neat transaction at the
Austrian border, one boy for
one slip of paper.

Nagy also had some things tu
say more directly to people than
to an unempathetic audience
For instance, that the failure on
the part of the Free World in
the 1956 Hungarian rebellion
was not a failure of arms, but a
failure of recognition. Face to

{' ” face, it was tacit indictment of

The man looked for all the

world like a tired burgomaster,

as if he were the embodiment of
a nation with a thousand years
of history and a record of num
erous oppressions. So he spoke
almost world-wearily to the em-
bodiment of a young nation
never overrun; and he spoke
with authority.

It was authority based on ex-
perience. He knew European
politics, both by having lived
through it and by having known
those involved in making it. Or
the Far Bast. So when Romir
Chatterjee baited him about the
aims of neutralist countries,
Nagy could argue, and cap it
with, “I had a most interesting
talk with your prime minister
last summer.” And a talk with
Truman. And De Gaulle.

Oh yes, he knew eastern
Europe, in the dnly way, per-
haps, jit can be known. And
seven or eight students, Presi-
dent and Mrs. Martin, and a
“fellow landsman” came to hear
about it.

Governor Of Texas
Also Hit By Bullets

President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is dead at the

age of 46, the victim of an
Tex.

assassin’s bullet in Dallas,

The President was shot in the head at 1:25 EST this

afternoon while riding with

Texas Governor John Con-

nally to deliver a speech at a trade fair luncheon.

Lyndon Baines Johnson, 55,
who has succeeded Kennedy as
the 36th president, was riding
some distance behind the presi-
dential car and was not injured.
According to early reports, an
unidentified secret serviceman
was killed in the assassination.

Gov. Connally is injured ser-
iously with two bullet wounds
in his back but is expected to
recover. Mra. Kennedy and Mrs.
Connally, both of whom were in
the limousine, were not injured.

Dallas police have taken into
custody Leo H. Oswald, 24, in
connection with the slaying.
Oswald has been charged in the
death of a Dallas police officer
and is being interrogated in con-
nection with the assassination
of the president.

Police said the President

lumped forward with blood on

his head and chest immediately
after three or four shots rang
out as the motoreade passed
just west of downtown Dallas.
The President’s bubble top
limousine, with the top down,
sped immediately to Dallas Park-
land Hospital. The President
succumbed in the  hospital’s
emergency room at 2 p.m. EST.
A high-powered rifle with a
telescopic sight was apparently
the assassination weapon. Short-
ly after the shooting police of-
ficlals discovered four shells on

the fifth floor of an office build-
ing directly across the street
from where the assassination
occurred.

Police immediately closed off
the area and began an intensive
search of the area.

John F. Kennedy was the
fourth American President as
sassiated while in office.
Others to die by the assassin’s
bullet were Lincoln, Garfield
and McKinley.

The youngest man ever to oc-
cupy the presidency, Kennedy
was born in 1917, the second
eldest of nine children. He was
graduated from Harvard Univer.
sity in 1940 and did graduate
work at Stanford University.

Pntering the Navy in 1941, he
served as a PT boat commander
in the Pacific, receiving two
decorations for bravery.

As a politician, Kennedy was
undefeated in all races for na-
tional office. He served in the
House of Representatives be-
tween 1946 and 1952. During the
Eisenhower year of '52, Kennedy
squeaked out a victory over
Henry Cabot Lodge to win a
Senate seat. In 1958, he was re-
elected by a landslide margin.

After barely failing to capture
the Democratic vice-presidential
nomination in Chicago in 1956,
Kennedy won the party’s presi-

Newspaper Offers
Journalistic Grants

The Newspaper Fund of the
Wall Street Journal is again of-
fering its scholarship program
for students working as news-
paper reporters this summer.
Under this program students
will receive a beginning report-
er’s salary in addition to a $500
grant by the Fund.

This program is primarily de-
signed for students at liberal
arts colleges which offer no
courses in journalism. This
would make the program. parti-
cularly applicable to Davidson.
Last year two Davidson students,
Charles Dibble and Charlie

The vacated student store area

“All of this,” states Smith, “is
just a part of the general plan
of improvement of the Union
facilities, especially in the area
of food service, so that Indepen-
dents, freshmen and faculty
members might have the privi-
lege of eating in a genteel at-
mosphere which fraternity men
now enjoy.

IFC Proposal Bounces
For Midwinters Formal

parabe to those at Davidson.
New plans were formulated call-
ing for a combo dance on Friday
night after the Georgia Southern
basketball game and for a con-
cert, featuring a “big name”
act, on Saturday night. The
combo party will last approxi-
mately two hours.

At the regular Monday night
meeting this week, dates were
eet for the annual Barium
Springs Christmas party and the
blood drive. The blood drive will
be on Dec. 10 and, according to
Red Cross regulations, all stud-
ents 21 years of age and under
will be required to present a
Telease signed by their parent
or guardian. The - Barium
Springs party was set for Dec.
13, and will include children in
the first through seventh grades.

The greup also decided te
investigate the alleged unsatis-
factory seating set-up for the
Coliseum games and, if neces-
sary, to lodge a complaint.

In previous action, the IFC
had announced the results of the
poll conducted several weeks
ago. A total of 252 students vot-
ed against a dance at Mid-
winters. Of these, 147 voted for
no dance with a concert on Sat-
urday night, 46 for no dance
with a concert on Saturday af-
ternoon, and 59 favored two
concerts only on Saturday.

Of those favoring a dance on
the weekend, 104 marked a semi-
formal combo dance as their
preference, with 83 students
voting for a formal dance and
54 for an informal combo dance.

Greek Week has been set for
the first week of second semes-
ter and will run from Thursday
of that week through Wednes-
day of the next. This will allev-
iate the problems caused by
Midwinters on the following
weekend, according to the coun-
cil.

Former President To Speak

Let There Be Light...

“Improvement of the lighting system around the fiter-
ary society halls is being given top priority in our program
for overall improvement of the system of outdoor lights on
the campus,” states Grover Meetze, Davidson's director of

the physical plant.

As a direct result of the recent assault in this area on
8 Davidson student, ia new light has been added to both the
Phi Hall and the Eu Hall. in addition, lamps with higher
wattage then those now in use have been ordered and are
to be put in use in the immediate future.

Meetze reported that more improvements in lighting

are expected to be made in the literary hall area end other
areas as soon as his office completes a study of the present

lighting system and determines what improvements

are

necessary. Concerning this study, he said that “most of the
buildings are pretty well lighted already, end we are now
concentrating mostly on lighting the roads and walks.”

“This study,” he noted, “will probably be concluded in
about three months, and then the Business Office will have
to act on our recommendations before any action is taken.”

Meetze also pointed out

that other places with poor

lighting Include the areas around the laundry and around
the road leading from the gym to the Concord Road, and
that these areas will have second priority in improvements.
Mercy vapor lamps will probably be used along roads and
incandescent lamps on the walks.
