THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 13, 1922.

THE PEANUT PARCHER

Getting out jokes once a week is no
picnic. If I print jokes they say I am
silly. If I don’t they say I’m serious.
If I put in original matter, they say it
lacks variety. If I copy anything from
other papers, they say I’m too lazy to
write. If I don’t go to church, they say
Im a heathen; if I do they say I’m a
hypocrite. If I stay in my room I ought
to be out hunting some jokes. If I hunt
for jokes I ought to be studying. If I
wear old clothes, I’m sloven; if I wear
new ones they’re not paid for. What am
I to do? Like as not some one will say
I swiped this from an exchange. So I
did!

Night Time.
He stood before the mirror
With his eyes closed very tight,
Trying to see just how he looked
When fast asleep at night.

Joe Rice—Well, I ought to, I’ve been
practicing all night.

Mixed Up.

While Bob McLeod was in Charlotte
the other day he walked into Kress’ and
asked the music clerk for “Chilli Beans.”
The clerk replied with outraged dignity,
“This isn’t a grocery store, young fel-
low.”

received a two-cent postage stamp.

Doctor—What was the greatest reign |
in history?
Zeb—“Why, I guess that was the

Jam—‘“Snapshot!

MAKE A FRIEND

“Friends may come and friends may
go, but a true friend is with for
ever.” I don’t know who said that, but!
I do know where it will apply.

A fellow said to me, the other day,
we were discussing certain business men,
“T feel like an old friend in some places
in which I have been only a few times,
and like a stranger in others where 1
have been many times.” To illustrate his
point he related this incident: “I have
ouly been in Ed. Mellon’s a few times,
but I feel as if I. had patronized that
store. all my. life. The first time T went |
there the clerk treated me as an indi-
vidual, a personality and not as merely

These-questions were not asked’in an in-

ond time I went to Charlotte IT was in-
terested to know whether or not this
clerk would remember me. To satisfy}
|my self on this, I went into the store all
ee this clerk’s particular department. He |
|ealled me by name, shook hands with me |
jand asked about a certain incident which |

{had happened recently in my. home}
|

town.”
That, of course, is an illustration of)

scientific salesmanship; but it is infinite- |
ly more than that. This fellow has a}
friend on the sales force at Ed Mellons, |
a man with whom he feels free to talk. |
!You know what that means to you when |
you want a suit, an overcoat, a pair of|
sroes, or a hat. If you are dealing with |
a stranger you often take an article |
which you do not like, rather than seem |
hard to please. On the other hand if you|
are dealing with a friend, you keep look- |
ing until you locate just what you want. |
Then you have an article that will be a}
constant source of pleasure to you. |

When in Charlotte make Mellons your |
headquarters; let them know who you|
are and where you are from. They are,
interested in you, first because you are
you, and second because you are from
Davidson. Ady.

What Is a Vacuum Furnace?

N an ordinary furnace materials burn or combine with the oxygen

of the air. Melt zinc, cadmium, ‘or lead in an ordinary furnace and a
scum of ‘‘dross’’ appears, an impurity formed by the oxygen. You see
it in the lead pots that plumbers use.

.

In a vacuum furnace, on the contrary, the air is pumped out so that
the heated object cannot combine with oxygen. Therefore in the
vacuum furnace impurities are not formed.

Clearly, the chemical processes that take place in the two types are
different, and the difference is important. Copper, for instance, if
impure, loses in electrical conductivity. Vacuum-furnace copper is
pure.

So the vacuum furnace has opened up a whole new world of chem-
ical investigation. The Research Laboratories of the General Electric
Company have been e::ploring this new world solely to find out the
possibilities under a new series of conditions.

Yet there have followed practical results highly important to
industry. The absence of oxidation, for instance, has enabled chemists
to combine metals to form new alloys heretofore impossible. Indeed,
the vacuum furnace has stimulated the study of metallurgical proc-
esses and has become indispensable to chemists yesponsible for
production of metals in quantities.

And this is the result of scientific research.

Discover new facts, add to the sum total of human knowledge, and
sooner or later, in many unexpected ways, practical results will follow.
