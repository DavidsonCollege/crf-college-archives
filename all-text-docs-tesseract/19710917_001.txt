Baroda U. Program A

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

As a part of the college’s
growing offerings in the area of
South Asian Studies, the facul-
ty has approved a Junior year
study program at the Univer-
sity of Baroda in Gujarat
State, India.

Although the program must
still gain the approval of the
Ministries of Education of the
state and the central govern-
ment in India, the college hopes
that approval can come by De-
cember of this year so that the
program can be initiated in
July, 1972.

Although instruction is in En-
glish, each student will be re-
quired to study either Hindi or
Guparati during the two-semes

Grey House Coeds
To Elect Senator

By JOHN KEPCHAR
Staff Writer
Another step in the accept-
ance of coeds as a part of
the Davidson student body will
be the election of a student
representative from the Grey
House, according to Danny
Clodfelter, president of the stu-

dent body.
Every other dorm has 2 voices
in the’ student government,

Clodfelter said. The presence
of a coed senator will be tacit
acknowledgement of the com-
ing realization that coeds are
an actual part of this student
body.

The girls seemed to express
am active interest in running
for the office. Many said the
establishment of ithis senate
seat is important to them since
it would mean an active voice
in such issues as dormitory re-
gulations at Grey House.

Many of the girls were parti-
cularly concerned about dormi-
tory hours since some come
from colleges with open dorm
policies.

Awaits Indian Approval

ter academic year. The study
will be directed toward com-
munication with the Indian
people rather than study of
Indian literature.

In addition to language study,
each student will enroll in one
regular course of the university
each semester, participate in
a seminar on current Indian
economic, social, and cultural
developments, and work on a
project of interest to him lead-
ing tto a ‘“‘substantial” paper.

Although the requirements
may seem rather lax, students
will find adjustment to life in
India demanding, and this ad-
justment should represent the
greatest part of their learning
experience, said John M. Be-
van, vice president for aca-
demic affairs.

Fifteen students will parti-
cipate in the program each
year. Students will be selected
on the basis of their academic

‘performance and their matur-

ity. Ability to adapt to the In-
dian life will be an important
requirement.

The college pians to rent or
lease several large bungalows
near the unviersity for the lodg-
ing of students in the program
and a few of the Indian stu-
dents who cannot find lodging
in the university’s overcrowded
hostels.

The Davidson students will
have their overall academic
and extra-curricular activities
supervised by an American di-
rector who has had previous
living experience in India.
‘The program director will
conduct the seminar each sem-
ester and before each year will
prepare for the anticipated
problems of adjustment.

Students will be urged to par-
ticipate in extra-curricular ac-
tivities of the regular univer-
sity, such as sports, drama, and

debating, to widen their cultur-
al experiences. They will not
be free to travel in India ex-
cept during vacation periods or
at the end of the year.

Among the seventeen Indian
states Gujarat has the second
highest percentage of educated
people. Its people are business-
men who control much of Bom-

Faculty Approves

Two Amendments

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

Proposals for student repre-
sentation on the Admissions
Committee and the Budget,
Building and Grounds Commit-
tee passed by majority vote on
first reading at the faculty
meeting Wednesday.

In order for these amend-
ments to be included in the
faculty constitution; however
they must survive a_ second
reading by a three-fourths vote
of the faculty at its next meet-
ing, and then be endorsed by

opted

bay’s business and industry and
much of the trade in other
parts of India and in East Afri-
ca.

The University of Baroda is
among India’s best, and is per-
haps her most experimental,
Bevan said. Her student body
numbers about 15,000; her fa-
culty, about 1,000. It is pri-
marily a ‘“‘liberal arts” college,
with course offerings in areas
similar to those at Davidson.

* On Representation

the trustees.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. said that the vote
on the Admissions Committee
proposal was 51-29, while that
on the Budget, Building and
Grounds Committee proposal
was 42-33.

Spencer said the faculty ex-
pressed some concern about
the actual function of the Bud-
get Building and Grounds Com-
mittee.

“This particular section of
the faculty constitution deals
with what is termed ‘faculty
concerns,” Spencer said. ‘‘Sin-
ce this may include policy on
faculty salaries, several facul-
ty members expressed hesitan-
cy in allowing student in-put on
this subject.”

The Admissions Committee
proposal allows for two. stu-
dents selected by the student
Senate from nominees present-
ed to the Senate by any mem-
ber of the student body.

Although the students on the
committee will not have access
to confidential information or
vote on the application of pol-
icy to individual cases, they
will be able itto express their
opinion on general admissions

Peace Coalition Outlines Fall

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

An October Moratorium, a
National Peace Action Day,
and a continuing campaign to
end the draft will comprise the
major portion of the Fall Of-
fensive for the Davidson Peace
Coalition.

Outlining the programs for
the coming year, Ralph Pee-
ples, spokesman for the group,
said he hoped that classes
might be suspended for Nation-
al Moratorium Day, Oct. 13.

Peeples said that a suspen-
sion of classes would allow the
community to hear speakers
and attend discussions in an ef-
fort to bolster local conscious-
ness about the continuation of
the Vietnam War.

Peeples then unfolded pro-
posals for the National Peace
Action Day, scheduled for Nov.
6. National leaders for the ev-
ent call for miassive regional
demonstrations in 12 population
pockets, including Washington,
D. C., and Atlanta, Georgia.

Peeples said that these dem-
onstrations will feature massive
civil disobedience in an effort
to dramatize the death toll a-
mong Vietnamese civilians. and
soldiers and American soldiers.

The uncertain status of the

Selective Service Laws prompt-
ed Peeples to urge increased
letter-writing to postpone inde-
finitely reinstatement of ‘the
law.

Peeples shifted the discussion
to a thorough denunciation of
the ‘“‘Write Hanoi’ campaign,
popular last spring in this area.

He contended that evidence

now shows that’ the campaign
was a deliberate effort by the
government to replace public
outrage with the conduct of the
War to concern for U. S.
P.O.W.’s.

He added that citizens con-
cerned about the ‘‘prisoner is-
sue” might better write their
own capital in Washington.
