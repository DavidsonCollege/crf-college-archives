Religion Professor McKelway’s New Book Advocates
Recognition Of "The Freedom Of God"

By John Wilson

In his latest book, The Free-
dom of God and Human Libera-
tion, _ Professor Alexander—J.
McKelway, of the Religion De-
partment, says people should not
view God by their own morals and
values. McKelway’s argument
emphasizes that “we should not
project our own image and values
on.God, because we would miss
"the freedom of God”’, or the real-
ity of God.

The statement asking “Was
God on our side?” follows a mes-
sage McKelway sends tothe reader
in his book.

“The book causes the reader to
recolonize their conception of re-
ality with the reality of God,”
McKelway stated: ‘He says we
should notconfuse our values with
God’s values because it will inter-
fere in our understanding of divine
freedom for human liberation.

McKelway,aprofessor of reli-

gion since 1965, argues how we
must not project our own interests,
values, and ideals on God. “‘When
we do this,” he stated, “we become
rigid and dogmatic: We close our
eyes to the other possibility in the
way God may work.”

He focuses on democracy in
one example. “We must not as-
sume that democracy is.the only
possibility for freedom in Eastern
Europe.” He writes, “theology

- must be open to the infinite variety

of ways that God’s freedom for
human life takes place.”

One example McKelway dis-
cusses how ideology failed to iden-
tify itself with divine truth is seen
with the Soviet Union during the
Cold War.

The Conservative party sought
tooverthrow the government, while
the Liberal party believed an revo-
lutionary approach was notneeded.
Both sides represented divine truth.
However, both sides were wrong.

One of McKelway’s points in
the book focuses on encouraging

suppressed groups that a sacrifi-

cial element is needed before free-
dom can be reached.
The theory of freedom relates

Alumnus Tom Earnhardt
Speaks About Environment

By Russ Tisinger

Last Thursday in the Morrison
Room, Tom Eamhardt,a Davidson
graduate and now National Direc-
tor of Trout Unlimited, a water
conservation -group,; ; spoke . to
Davidson students about what his
job entails, his experiences work-
ing in the Soviet Union, and finally
about the state of the environment
there.

The {08 costed plans
early in life of dedicating himself
to his current vocation. After
graduating from Davidson he be-
came alaw professor. Eventually,
however, he combined a life-long
interest in fishing and a knack for
photography into slide shows for
his own enjoyment. He soon be-
gan to be approached to work for
the Sierra Club and other conser-
vation groups, and he was eventu-
ally chosen as national director of
Trout Unlimited.

Earnhardt travels stienialVély

speaking and conducting seminars:

_in water conservation for conser-
vation groups. — Interestingly
enough, he spends the majority of
his time outside the United States.
He spent all but three days of the
past summer working and speak-
ing overseas, and has been to the
Soviet Union four times.

He focused on one trip in par-

ticular that he took to the Soviet
Union. He received 2 an official in-

vitation to talk with the local gov-

ernment of the city of Murmansk.
The cost of the trip was prohibi-
tive, but ee favors of spon-

sors, he was able to make all the
extensive arrangements necessary
for the voyage. After plans had
been made and he was ready to go,
Soviet officials did everything in
their power to subtly make it im-

possible, for him to get into the.

country.
Just one day before he was to

leave, he was informed that his

visa had been denied due to an
unreasonable technicality. After
flying to Washington and contact-
ing as many other friends as he

his meetings and to talk more about
improving tourism in their city.
He ended up making friends
that he would always remember.
The meetings that were planned
for the visit were all with Soviet
officials. In the Soviet Union there
simply aren’t Organized interest
groups that could arrange aconfer-
ence. However, after Earnhardt’s
meetings, Soviet citizens ap-
proached him and asked him to
come to their apartments and talk
with them about environmental

to a familiar slogan seen in Mat-
thew 10:39. Here, the idea sug-
gests people should not project their
own images of God, before trying
to recognize the underlying truth
of God.

McKelway argues that the
Bible is not only a message of
liberation but one as a “liberating
word”. McKelway explained, “The
Bible acts as a mirror on the im-
agery of God. We have to under-
Stand that the Bible’s personal
imaginary for God directs us to a
reality quite different from our
own.”

McKelway emphasizes that the
“free word” of a free God in the
Bible does not become fixed by the
limitations of the authors. He

Stands. against the practice of
reshaping the “God-language” in
the Bible.

The practice of altering the
male nouns and pronouns portrays
another act of projecting. Again,

McKelway tries to remind us not
to apply our own images on God.

McKelway writes that we must
“avoid the Bible’s way of speak-
ing of God, but to employ that
language with theological under-
standing.”

The idea that our projections
on God must go through a phase of
thinking which McKelway dis-
Cusses in more detail in the book.

- McKelway’s book is based
upon the Warfield Lectures he gave
in 1987 at Princeton where he
served as the Guest Professor of
Theology during 1986-1987 aca-
demic year. Hereceived his bache-
lor of arts in history from Davidson
College in 1957.

McKelway has previously pub-
lished two books, The Systematic
Theology of Paul Tillich and The
Context of Contemporary Theol-
ogy, as well as numerous articles.

Soviet citizens approached Earnhardt and asked
him to come to their apartments and talk with them
about environmental pollution,

could, he finally secured entry.

Once he actually arrived in
Murmanskhe was descended upon
by a whole team of custom offi-
cials that examined every inch of
every piece of the enormous
amount of baggage that was trans-
ported over with him. He was
finally taken to meet with a board
of officials who informed him that
his actions would be restricted and
he would not be allowed outside
the city.

After that was over, one offi-
cial had the courage to ask how

they could improve tourism for the

city! At that, Earnhardt couldn’t
help but give all of the officials a
piece of his mind. They listened,

- and once he was finished, their
tone softened, and they asked him

to return the next day and conduct

pollution and other environmental
issues. He ended up meeting many
Soviets this way, and: talked to
them about everything from water
pollution to fly fishing.

Finally, Earnhardt addréssed
the state of the environment in and
around Murmansk. He showed
slides and talked about problems
plaguing much of the Soviet Un-
ion such as sedimentation, clear-
Cutting, and acid rain.

In the area surrounding Mur-
mansk the land was reported to be
holding 40.to 50 tons of sulfur per
acre. The lack of restrictions on
the. industrial. complex of USSR
combined with the lack of any sort
of organized environmental inter-
est groups in that country presents
unique and particularly dangerous
situation it the Soviet Union.
