~Fower emphasizes value of liberal arts education

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Although busy celebrating his .

twenty-fifth class reunion with
fellow alumni, Georgia Senator
Wyche Fowler '62 agreed to an-
swer a few questions about David-
son’s role in the molding of public
officials. Besides serving the’ state
of Georgia as a senator, Fowler
has also served Georgia citizens as
an alderman for the city of Atlanta
and as aU.S. Congressman for ten
years. Following are his com-
ments.

Davidsonian: How have your
experiences at Davidson affected
your career?

Fowler: I still believe strongly
that the finest foundation for liv-
ing responsibly and with a sense
of community, of sharing, and of
one’s obligations to community
and society is a liberal arts educa-
tion. The values that come from
the study of history and literature
and of those who have come. be-
fore are what, not only mold one’s
character, but give one that wider
perspective — that all the prob-

EPC proposal reshapes calendar and amriculum

By JIM DILLON

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) has made its recom-
mendation for changes in the
Davidson curriculum and calen-
dar and approved it by a vote of
eight to zero with one abstention
and will now face the faculty for
approval.

Major changes proposed in the
recommendation report are based
on a new semester system, which
the committee recommends
adopting. The new semester sys-

tem would basically entail stu- -

dents taking four courses over a
period of two terms in a year, and
32 courses required for gradua-
tion. Faculty would be expected to
teach five coursés in a year.
Courses would meet for 50 mi-
nutes on Monday, Wednesday

lems that you have, someone else
has had before and that the only
limits to manmade problems are
the lack of imagination and deter-
mination to put new ideas and new
eminds to work on solving these
problems. 7

My education at Davidson has

had a profound influence on me. It

taught me to be curious. It chal-
lenged my preconceptions and
prejudices in many areas that [ar-
rived with as a hot-shot high
school student. I remember in Dr.
Polley’s Bible course having to
read Schweitzer and Niebuhr in
the first three weeks. I never had
read anything except some little
Biblical tract to challenge my un-
derstanding and perspective of my
faith. So it was a powerful experi-
ence. I don’t know whether
Davidson taught me how to think,
but it certainly taught me how to
reflect and to rethink.
Davidsonian: In_ reflecting
‘upon the Iran-Contra affair and
the recent indictment of a Con-
gressman, it is hard not to believe

and Friday or for 75 minutes on
Tuesday and Thursday.
Additional changes
take place as follows:
Course numbering would be
altered such that 100 level courses
would be introductory courses;
200 level courses would be inter-
mediate or general courses; 300
level courses would be advanced;
and 400 level courses would be
specialized courses in one’s major
and intended only for seniors.
Each major department would
offer a “capstone seminar” for
seniors. This would be used as a
medium for “intellectual dis-
course amont students as well as
between students and professors.”
Interdisciplinary senior seminars
would also be instituted.
Students with a grade point

would

that many politicians simply lose
their sense of ethics once they at-
tain a position of power. Can a
college such as Davidson provide
a strong enough background for a
person in public service to main-
tain his sense of ethics and mor-
als? ‘

Fowler: I would like to think
that the quality of my public ser-
vice will reflect those principles
that I learned both in my church
and in my education at Davidson.
I can say that “full stop” as the
British say, end of sentence. But
in our country, the people are the
government. I am merely a repre-
sentative. I am a steward of that
trust. And in a-democracy, the
people get the kind of government
they deserve, because it’s their de-
cision as to who serves.

That means that.if you tolerate
apathy in your, public officials,
you get apathy. If you tolerate cor-
ruption in your public officials,
you are going to get corruption.
But it is only the activism of the
citizen who realizes that the

average of 3.2 or better would be
eligible for honors work in their
major. Students would be “en-
couraged to consider an Honors
program of study.” Students
would also be encouraged to con-
sider a senior thesis or project.
‘Concentrations would be
adopted which would allow stu-
dents to supplament their major
and would be recognized as such
on a transcript. Concentrations
would require the taking of four to
six courses in the concentration,
two of which must be at the 300 or

400 level. Concentrations would .

require faculty approval by the
first semester of the junior year.
Independent studies would be
encouraged. Sophomores would
be allowed one independent study
in a year while juniors would be

people form the government in
this country and that you are pretty
much going to get elected repre-
sentatives who reflect, not only
the hopes and aspirations of the
people who elect, but also the
ethical standards and the moral
precepts that govern their charac-
ter and their conduct.

When you get Congressmen
who are in trouble, again that is
the genius of the system in a way.
The United States Congress, the
535 people, pretty much reflects
the traits and problems and
peculiarities of the people they
represent. That means that if three
or four percent of the society are
alcoholics, you will probably get
three or four percent in the Con-
gress. And if you get three or four
percent of the society who tum out
to be crooks, you are probably
going to get that reflected also in
the Congress. But it is the people
and the citizen who can make that
determination because they can
throw the bad ones out. And that’s

allowed two and seniors would be
allowed three. All independent
studies would necessitate faculty
approval:

Departments would be en-
couraged to assess the quality of
their major by comparing David-
son senior majors to national aver-
ages. The committee recom-
mended that Graduate Record
Examinations (GRE) “provide ex-
amples of what might be done.”

The committee recommended
changing the current area require-
ments from 12 courses (three each
in four areas of study) to 10
courses which would be distri-
buted in: the following manner:
one course in literature (English or
foreign); one course in art, music,
theatre or speech; one course in

State of computers 1s mixed.at Davidson

By NELLE MCCORKLE

The Computer Services Cen-
ter must sell 50 computers by July
1 to fulfill the college’s contract
with International” Business
Machines (IBM).

The Davidson/IBM volume-
purchase agreement grants a 30%
discount provided that the college
buys 150 new machines annually.
Currently the college retains ap-
proximately 75 new machines per
year and resells 75 at cost. “This
program is called the PC [Personal
Computer] project,” Assistant Di-
rector for Academic Computing
John Savarese said. Davidson be-
came IBM’s first educational af-
filiate at the college rather than
university level.

“Davidson offers a greater dis-
count than many universities
which operate similar programs,”
Savarese said. “We pass on the
exact price we pay,” he said.

Established in March 1984,
the program has sold 331 com-
puters to date. The college uses
129 of those computers; 66 faculty

members, 24 staff members, and
112 students purchased the. other
machines.

Davidson finances the project,
including the salary of a full time
employee who markets the
machines and processes orders.

Last year the program also
sold almost one-third of its quota
at the end of the fiscal year. The
COmputer Services Center resold
30 machines in June 1986 to
guarantee renewal of IBM’s con-
tract. “We didn’t think it [the con-
tract] was going to be renewed,”
Savarese said. The Computer Ser-
vices Center primarily markets the
machines with a mailing to incom-
ing freshmen, SAvarese said. His
office also planned a Computer
fair this past fall and maintains
two Chambers bulletin boards.

The program permits an inter-
est-free loan to faculty and staff
members who buy the college’s
new IBM personal computers.
Applicable to purchases up to
$3,000, this credit system allows
repayment over one, two, and

three years. sixty faculty members
now own personal computers pur-
chased from the college.

No such loan. exists for stu-
dents. “I wish we had a loan for
Students . . . It may happen in the
future, I think it would be an ex-
cellent idea,” he said.

Some technical institutions re-
quire student ownership of com-
puters, but Savarese considers the
computer's role different at a lib-
eral arts college. “We have no
computer science program here.
That’s not the way most of us ap-
proach computing, and I think
that’s appropriate for a liberal arts
college. For us, computing is
something that should be woven
into everything we do. Most of us
are not interested in computers in
themselves, . . . but as tools, and
I think that’s right for a liberal arts
college,” he said.

College ownership of personal
computers increased from 20
machines to the present 138 IBM
models over the past two year.

Savarese advocates college-

wide emphasis on personal com-
puters. “The computer is 90% a
communications tool. In any joint
endeavor — it’s important that,
you speck the same language,” he
said. “It’s like having all railroads
run with the same gauge of track.”

He considers IBM’s latest
model sufficient for Davidson’s
needs and does not anticipate col-
lege sale of IBM-Compatible
products.

Instead, Savarese considers
networks the most important cur-
rent development for Davidson
computing. He foresees joint ac-,
cess to information available at
other colleges.

Davidson’s use of the PRIME
computer involves mainly statisti-
cal study, Savarese said. He
said,““Some things work better on
one system then the other.”
Savarese cited PRIME use of SAS
and SPSS-X statistical software

" packages for economics, political

science, psychology, and sociol-
ogy.

why the House of Representatives
is elected every two years.

Davidsonian: But does
Davidson provide a strong back-
ground in terms of values and
ethics for the public servant?

Fowler: What Davidson does
is expose. It exposes the values in-
herent in our courses. The nuggets
are there for a student to dig out. I
‘often say to graduates, who say,
“You know I would like to go into
politics, but T haven't had any
preparation in political science,”
that that is not the preparation.
That helps, but it is your studies of
history and literature as well as
philosophy and even architecture,
that is the best preparation. And if
you want a crash course in politi-
cal science and political theory,
all you need to know about poli-
tics, all you have to do is read the
tragedies of Shakespeare. And
contained in Macbeth and Othello
and Julius Caesar and King Lear
are just about all you need to know
about politics.

history; two courses in religion
and philosophy (at least one of
which must be religion); one
course in mathematics; two
courses in science (one with a lab-
oratory); and two courses in social
science (anthropology ,
economics, political science, psy-
chology or sociology). Students
additionally would have to take at
least one course designated as a
“nonwestem course.”

For a major a student would
have to complete at least 10 but no
more than 12 courses in his major,
five of which must be at the 300 or
400 level. Students would have to
achieve a grade point average of
2.00 or better in all courses in the
major and receive a B or better in
at least two courses in the major.

Other computer systems used
at Davidson include Apple per-
sonal computers. Psychology Pro-
fessor and Center for Special
Studies Director John Brockway
received an Apple Corporation
and Sloan Foundation grant which
provided Macintosh Plus personal
computers. Ordered in “March,
these machines will arrive May
20. Classical Studies and Music
departments will each use three
computers; the psychology de-
partment will use five, Brockway
said.

College use of differing Apple
and IBM personal computers
caused no conflict, Brockway .
said. “In an administrative sense,
it provides what is known as a
multi-system environment. For a
while Macintosh seemed to be the .
only machine which merged ex-
citing graphics and text in a single
machine now. It?s my understand-
ing that the new IBMs do that, but
I have no experience with that,”
he said.
