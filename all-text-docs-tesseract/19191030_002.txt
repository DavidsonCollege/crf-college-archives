Happenings of the Past Week

The Clemson Tigers continued their
successful season with a victory over the
strong Tennessee aggregation by a score
of 14 to o. Clemson, according to
Heisman, has the best team she has had
in 10 years. Next Thureday at noon
Clemson will play the University of
South Carolina at the State Fair in Co-
lumbia. This will be the big game of
the state.

Furman surprised the Carolina foot-
ball circles by defeating Wake Forest
39-7. By comparative scores of the Da-
vidson-Wake Forest and Carolina-Wake
Forest games it would appear that the
Wildcats will have a very formidable
foe on Thanksgiving day in Furman.

Citadel downed P. C. by a 12 to 7
count.

Glen Warner's Pittsburgh Panthers
defeated the Georgia Tech’s Golden
Tornado 16 to 6. Pittsburgh piled up
her score in the first half, after which
the Southerners rallied and outplayed
the Panthers, but were unable to over-
come the long lead. Tech played a won-
derful game and twice held Pitt on her
one-foot line.

The strong Syracuse team, which ad-
ministered the decisive defeat to Pitts-
burgh, went down in defeat to Washing-
ton and Jefferson by a score of 13 to 0.
Double passes were used by both sides
throughout the first half, but without
result.

The University of North Carolin se-
cured the decision over N. C. State by
a close score of 13 to 12. This was the
first time these two elevens have playe
in several years. From all accounts it
appears that the University was very for-
tunate in securing the victory. The
game was very close and hard fought
with Coach Fetzer’s team having a
slight advantage during most of the
game. Each team made two touch-
downs and on account of the niuddy field
only one goal was kicked. This goal
with its lone tally proved to be. the de-
ciding factor of the game, and Carolina
emerged the victor. Carolina’s substi-
tutions, 12 in all, proved to be an inter-
esting item of the game. Gurley was
the star for N. C. State.

Washington and Lee defeated Roan-
oke College 32 to 0. N. C. State de-
feated this same aggregation by a score
of 78 to o and on a mud-soaked field.

Week’s Play Shows Georgia Pitted
Against Watts for Championship

Watts 26—North Wing Chambers 14.

Watts added another scalp to her belt:
on Wednesday, North Wing Chambers
being the victims, 26-14. The game was
pretty snappy, and Watts piled up her
score by superior team work and pass-
ing, having recovered from her reversal
of form in the Rumple “fight.” It was
a very even contest through the first half,
Watts leading by just three goals, but
they picked up speed in the last session,
putting the game on ice within a very
few minutes. Both Watts and Georgia
are now undefeated, and the student
body is looking forward with glee to
next Thursday, the 3zoth, when they,
clash in the game which will decide the
championship.

Watts again emerged the victor in her
game with South Wing Chambers last
Friday by a score of 67-15. The team
work of Watts was responsible for the
large score. The forwards of S. Wing
were completely baffled, all of the 15
points being scored by the center and
one guard. The game was not very in-
teresting to the spectators on account of

the one-sided score. Line-up:

Georgia retained her lead in the in-
ter-dormitory basketball series by de-
feating Louisiana, 49-8. The game was
harder fought than the score indicates,
but on account of superior passing and
shooting Georgia was able to run up a
large score. The Louisiana team fought
hard and made their opponents extend
themselves, at times, to score. Line-up:

The arrangements are being complet-
ed for taking the entire student body to
Charlotte to see the game on November
8. Manager Frank Hall has made ar-
rangements for extra cars to be placed on
the 11:50 train to carry the students.

Of course the fellows will want to
take in the town after the game, so the
special will not leave Charlotte until
about 11 o'clock that night. This will
allow everyone to be back on the hill
before Sunday.

In regard to fares Mr, Abernathy says
he does not know exactly what has been
planned, but probably there will be a
reduction. In any case it will not be
more than the ordinary fare The only
condition is a guarantee of one hundred
dollars to pay for the special train on
the return trip. This means that every
loyal Davidson man must back up the
proposition. ;

students in cheers, songs and parade are
