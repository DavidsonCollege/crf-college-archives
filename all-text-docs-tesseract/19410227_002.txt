1T WON'T WORK!

In order to eombat the difficult study con-

oe

ditions which sometimes prevail in the dor- |

mitories, it has been suggested by some par-
ties that a_tWhite Flag System” (as it has
been sometimes called) be put into operation
by the students for their own benefit.

It should be said, in all fairness that noise
in the dormitories has not increased noticeably
this year over previous years, and conditions
appear to be about. the same as usual. Dis-
tracting sounds, the number of visiting “bull-
‘artists,” and the other factors which tend to
make coneeniration difiicult vary with the
season, the day of the week; and time of day
Al umes it is weil nigh impossible to work in |

ation—— — ~

Study signs would heiprin oniv one Tespect

a student cowid guarantee himself privacy
in his room (provided a system could be
worked out which would be practical), and
this certainly would be advantageous to all.

‘The major question faciag those who ad-
vocate this plan is whether it will be practical;
whether the plan will function smoothly, or
whether the signs will soon be entirely worth-
tess dicongh discegard and misuse. Ii the
plan is to work there must be some way to
enforce ohedience. Theoretically (and ideal-
istically) it will work through cooperation of
all students. Practically it will -not—heeause,
there will always bz some men who will never
cooperate, and none who will cooperate at all
times. Therefore, there must be some

sanc-
tion. |
——But here again arises the question, what.
will be the means of enforeement?. Honor.

System? Obviously not, without bothering
to go into the taamy reasons against this meth-
od. Srudent body regulations? This might
be one way to deat with the thing.
will enioree these regulations? Not the stu-
dent body, for it is popular befief that that is
the job of the Stndent Council. and the student
body as a whole wilt not take it upon them-
selves to report such violations anymore thani|
they will report other violations of rules. Then,
should the Council deal with it? It might try,
but in the end wouldé fail, because there would
be too many violations for it to handle, along
with its other more important business.. And
then too, why lower the tone of such a re-
spected-body by asking it to deal with such
trite things ?.

Could hall committees handle it? This, on
first thought, might. appear to be the best
method. But on more careful judgment it will
soon be evident that 8ne committee could
hardly discipline a student from another dor-
mitory, mainly because they would have no
such power, and if such committee did have
