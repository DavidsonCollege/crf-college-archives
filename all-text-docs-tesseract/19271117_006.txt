lOne Man Killed and

Five Hurt in Wreck

One man was killed and five others
were seriously injured in an automobile
accident near Davidson last Friday night.
Fred Mayhew, 33, pressing club owner
and operator of Davidson, was fatally in-
jured and died at the Mooresville hospital
with a fractured skull, The injured were
Willie Walley, of Iredell County, with
severe bruises and lacerations; Lewis
Sherrill, also of Iredell County, painful
cuts and. bruises; Mrs. Lewis Sherrill,
reported in a serious condition resulting
from lacerations and shock; and Will
Sherrill, with a broken collarbone, severe
bruises, and possible internal injuries.
Witnesses say that the accident, which
occurred at a point on the old Rock Road,
about two miles from Davidson, came
when the car driven by Mr. Mayhew col-
lided with the one driven by Walley, with
whom the Sherrills were riding. The
Walley car was
force of the inipact and severely injured
the occupants. Mr. Mayhew’s car skid-
ded along the road for a distance and,
leaving the road, turned over three times
and landed on its wheels. The jolt hurled
Mr. Mayhew free of the wreckage, but
his skull was fractured.in the collision.
The survivors were unable to summon
assistance for some time. Passing motor-
ists finally brought word of the wreck to
Davidson, from which point aid was sent
to the victims. Mayhew was taken by

Harvard’s Tutorial
System Discussed

Cambridge, Mass.—(By the New Stu-
dent Service).—Harvard’s tutorial system,
recognized generally as the American
counterpart of the Oxford and Cam-
bridge plans, and the goal toward which
many universities in this country are
working, is not only different from the
British plans, but is not meant to ap-
proximate them.

this was explained in the Crimson by
Professor R. M. Eaton, chairman of the
board of tutors in philosophy, who be-
lieves that the lecture system “must con-
tinue to bear the load of imparting in-
formation, while the tutor integrates this
diverse material and aids the student ‘in
gaining an intelligent grasp of the whole
field.”

In contrast to the function of the Ox-
ford tutor who prepares his student
for examinations, the Harvard plan as-
sumes that his course give the student
sufficient information for that, leaving the
tutor free to unify the knowledge and
humanize it. :

For this reason Prof. Eaton believes
the lecture and tutorial systems inter-
dependent, and regards as bad the pos-
sibility of weakening either. The lecture
system resulted in “written exposition”
whereas the tutorial system permits
“verbal discussion of the field.”

Professor Eaton defines the function of
the tutor as that of discovering the “in-
dividuality of the student, finding his
main interests, and then arousing an ex-
pression of those ideas by which knowl-
edge become a living part of the students’
mental fiber.”

and died without regaining consciousness.

Mr. Mayhew was well known at Da-
vidson among the «student body. He
handled dry cleaning work for a large
number ofthe students, being represented
onthecampusbyJo , ,Lghillgteuin gagaga
on the campus by John T. Emby. He was
always an enthusiastic supporter of ev-
erything that was of interest to Davidson
and helped whenever he could to promote
student projects. He is survived by his
widow and three small children.
