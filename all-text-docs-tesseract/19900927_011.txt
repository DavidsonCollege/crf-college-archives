Mystery Calls Student to
Track Amelia Earhart

By LISA GERRARD

Last yearatthistime, Davidson

College senior Russ Matthews was

' fighting through tropical under-
brush on a South Pacific island, on
the trail of the Amelia Earhart
mystery.

Video camera in hand, Mat-
thews joined an expedition last Sep-
tember to search for clues to the
disappearance of the famed U.S.
aviator during her 1937 globe-cir-
cling flight.

“Tt was a chance to make his-
tory instead of just studying about

it,” says Matthews, a Princeton,~~2,500 miles from New Guinea to—

New Jersey, senior at Davidson
who filmed the trip for The Inter-
national Group for Historical Air-
craft Recovery (TIGHAR) of
Wilmington, Delaware.

The 28-member research team
and crew brought back no aircraft
or human remains to positively
solve the Earhart mystery. But in
the village rubble on the tiny island
of Nikumaroro, they did discover a
possible clue. »

“We brought back a naviga-
tor’s bookcase that appears to have
been mounted in Earhart’s Electra
airplane,” said Matthews. “At first
we thought it was made to go in a
World War II navy plane, but by
the way it was installed and be-
cause of some other, non-standard
features, we knew it was never
mounted in a war-time aircraft.
What we would have, then, is a
pre-war American aircraft part on
a backwater island in the Pacific
Ocean.”

Shortly after TIGHAR’s Sep-

tember expedition, Earhart project :
director Ric Gillespie received.

word of a makeshift water-collec-
tion device found on the island.
The two. pieces of evidence
may indicate Earhart and her navi-
gator, Fred Noonan, survived a
landing on Nikumaroro ‘in July
1937 and waited in vain forrescue.
Matthews said the 1989 expe-
dition was the first scientific effort

toexplain Earhart’ s disappearance.

“Two members of TIGHAR came
up with anavigation theory in 1988
and evidence pointed to the fact

that no one had searched the most

likely place the plane Would be,”
he said.
Earhart was on course to fly

Helen Island when her plane down.
She may have landed in distress or
simply by mistake onthe coral reef
of then-uninhabited Gardener Is-
land, now called Nikumaroro. ,

“With no computers and no
satellites, flying from town to town
in the U.S.-was even a problem at
that time,” Matthews said, “An
island in the vast expanse of the
Pacific Ocean might as well have
been a speck of dust.”

TIGHAR investigators theo-
rizethatEarhartand Noonan landed
at low tide on the island’s coral
reef flat, but that waves and tides
dragged the plane off the side of
the reef to depths of more than
2,000 feet.

The island was not populated
until at least a year after Earhart
and Noonan disappeared, when
Great Britain moved settlers there
to raise coconuts. The island is
now deserted. Only piles ofrubble
from previous settlements and the

Sometimes the best storics are
right in front of your face, or per-
haps up the road a ways on High-
way 150 just outside of
Mooresville. That’s where Kemp
Sherrill has spenta lifetime in our
little corner of Carolina.

This is Mr. Sherrill’s four-
teenth year at Davidson. Officially
retired, he now works part time,
five hours, five nights a week. If
you ever lock your keys in your

look Kemp up. He’ II take care of
you and spin you some mighty
intcresting tales if you’re willing
to stick around.

Born in 1916, Kemp remem-
bers growing op on a farm his
daddy rented near Mooresville.
Healways heard of Davidson and
knew “big things” were happen-
ing afew miles south. “They said
you had to have real high scores
to getin there.” He remembers he
and his father once selling a load
of cut firewood to Davidson for
heating fucl. “They didn’t have
so much electricity back then.”

In 1932 Kemp’s dad died. To
support his five younger brothers
and sisters Kemp’s mom told him
he would have to Ieave school to
run the farm and make ends mect.
He was in the fifth grade. The

Kemp had no great love for farm-
ing. Cotton picking and com
shucking thrilled him not, and he
was once draggeda mile when his
foot caught in the trace of a
spooked mule’s harness. He woke
up the next morning with 135
stitches between him and any

plow.

Like many rural southerners
of that time he looked for work at
the local textile mill. “The boss
down there knowed my dad had
died, and he wanted to help me
out.” Kemp and his mother both
found work.at Moorcsville Mills.
All his brothers and sisters fin-

room or just want apleasantchat, .

affection he may have held forthe .

In 1942 World War II called
Kemp away from Carolina to the
battlefields of Europe. “I got put in
atrucking regiment. They gave that

whole regiment a written test. And _

you know how many guys passed
out of all of ‘em... five. I was onc
of ‘em.”

Kemp made corporal and gotto °

drive a jeep. A certain Coloncl Wil-
liams, an assistant to Gencral Omar
Bradley, naticed Kemp and took
him as his personal driver. “L got to
live in the same house with them
Generals. Slept in a bed.” Beucr
than a foxhole in France by a long
shot.

of the Bulge. The trucks crept
along packed close together “and
then they throwed them buzz
bombs in at us and hit an MP
truck with twenty-one men on it.
Killed ‘cm all. We couldn’t find
no morc than littlc picces of bodics

To avoid the bombs Kemp
and the remaining men climbed
to the top of a nearby hill and hid
in the trees. “I remember there
was this Amcrican Red Cross tent

tain. They had the wounded layin’

Going in to mect with him, I

myself saw Williamson as the
intimidating Biology Chairman.
However, I discovered my best
clue that Williamson isn’t so “big
intimidating, mean and tough,” but
rather truly enjoys helping and

being nice to others on my way
out. On his sccretary’s desk was a

We’ re thinking of having the audi-
ence on stage with the actors,” said
Barber. -

Through direct student partici-

pation and planning in the New
Vagabonds, students will not be
limited by the offerings of the small
theater staff. Its structure allows
for students to create their own

theater expericnce. Whether the »

New Vagabonds becomes onc’s

top priority at Davidson, or whether
itis only participated in as a pass-
ing interest, the group provides an
easy way to get involved. Accord-
ing to Barber, “Students can have
fun as well as feeling the satisfac-
tion of creativity.”
