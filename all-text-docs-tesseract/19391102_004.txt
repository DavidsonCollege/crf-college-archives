Hank Bahnson, 176 pound junior

Cat line all season. Hank, having
played a brilliant game against Fur-
man last week-end, is being counted
on heavily against Citadel Satur-

David Huffines, Sophomore:

I see nothing particularly wrong
with the actual composition except
that it what we need. No
one can truly express the feelings
for and the traditions of an insti-
tution unless he has actually attend-
ed the institution and had these
things instilled into him. This new

easily be tranferred to any other
school in the same way as “College

Two years ago a fine composition
was written by Dr. George M. Max-
well, '96, and was presented to the
student body. Due either to the
method in which is was presented
or to the feeling at that time, it

was rejected. To me it seems that

verses instead of one as this rath-

Bill Sprunt, Sophomore:

that the words

to be used-by Davidson_as an Alma
Mater Hymn, and it would proba-
bly be rather hard for’the student
body as.a whole to sing the tune.
The song certainly sounded fine
when the Waring glee club sang
it, but could the student body sing
it in a way that-they would be
proud of? I don’t blame the author
for this, for a person who has never
been to Davidson could hardly be
expected to have the feeling for it
that those who have been here feel.
I feel that I am opposed to the
adoption of the hymn in its pres-
ent form, but if the words perhaps
might be altered, it would be ac-
ceptable,
