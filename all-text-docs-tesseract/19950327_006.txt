Week in Washington: | |
Controversial issues plague

Republicans in Congress

By ANDREA SHORT
Washington Week correspondant

As last week wore on, Repub-
licans found that issues in Con-
gress have only became more divi-
sive. Wrestling with spending cuts,
tax credits, and welfare programs,
House Republicans found them-
selves at odds with the Democrats,
the Senate, and members of their
own party.

The Senate Finance Commit-
tee and its chairman, the ethically
embroiled Senator Bob Packwood,
grabbed the week’s early head-
lines. After a weekend retreat on
the Chesapeake Bay, committee
members returned to Washington
to announce their bipartisan com-
mitment to cutting the federal defi-
cit. Senator John Breaux (D-
Louisiana) commented that cut-
ting the deficit “is [a problem] big
enough for both of our parties to
work on at the same time.”

The Finance Committee
backed its pledge with details:
Packwood advocates cutting $700
billion in federal spending by 2002.
This weighty promise would ne-
cessitate drastic slashing of feder-
ally funded programs, but the com-
mittee feels that the deficit’s cur-
rent growth demands attention. For
President Clinton and the Republi-
can legislators who promised tax
cuts during their campaigns, com-
mitting to deficit reduction would
involve tremendous political risk;

however, openly opposing deficit-
reducing legislation may also spell
political suicide in a climate where
voters are demanding a halt to the
upward-spiraling deficit.

Prioritizing deficit reduction
puts the Senate committee at odds
with the more conservative mem-
bers of the Republican Party.
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his
followers have already promised
Americans $189 billion in tax cuts.
But the week’s most surprising
development happened when 103
House Republicans banded to-
gether to alter the Contract with
America’s central tax-cutting
promise — the $500 per child tax
credit for families.

The group of dissenting Re-
publicans hopes to modify the
Contract promise, lowering the
maximum income level from
$200,000 to $95,000 per year; this
change approaches President
Clinton’s proposal to give tax credit
to families making $75,000 orless.
Lowering the cut-off level would
align the Republicans with the
middle-class and deflate the Demo-
crats’ political rhetoric; however,
few expect the Republican leader-
ship to compromise on this central
issue. The GOP rebels asked. the
House Rules Committee to amend
the rules of debate so they could
offer an amendment to change the
$200,000 level.

Debate on how to use the
newly saved money may be pre-

mature; no one has decided where
it’s coming from yet. On Thurs-
day, highly controversial welfare
legislation turned the House floor
into aschoolyard screaming match.
This broad-reaching welfare bill
attempts to radically restructure
social programs affecting virtually
every demographic category. The
government would no longeraward
teen mothers cash benefits, give
additional money to mothers al-
ready receiving welfare, or spend

_federal money for abortions. The

Republicans would give states
block grants to run school lunches,
WIC, and AFDC programs.
Groups cut off from all federal
assistance include legal immi-
grants, drug and alcohol addicts,
and a large number of mentally
and physically handicapped chil-
dren.

The fractious bill, although
dividing the House- inciting boos
and personal insults: on the floor-
momentarily linked pro-life and
pro-choice groups who were both
lobbying against the bill. A resolu-
tion prohibiting debate on indi-
vidual amendments passed 217-
211, but the narrow margin re-
vealed the deep rifts that this bill is
causing within the House GOP.

Serbs shell Tuzla,
breaking U.N. cease-fire

By GRAHAM ERNST
Dean Rusk adjunct reporter

Early last week, Bosnian Serb
forces shelled the northern Bosnian
town of Tuzla and looted U.N.
weapons stockpiles stealing mor-
tar equipment, anti-aircraft guns,
and other heavy munitions.

. This Serb attack came in re-
sponse to a Bosnian government
offensive against a Serb commu-
nications tower on Mount Majevica
northeast of Tuzla. This latest
round of fighting in the former
Yugoslavia all but ends the four*
month old U.N. cease-fire.

French U.N. peacekeepers of-
fered no resistance to the Serb in-
vaders as they ravaged through the
U.N. weapons collection site at
Lukavica near Sarajevo. Among
the munitions that the Serbs stole
are the long range mortar equip-
ment that the U.N. confiscated in
February 1994 to prevent expanded
air strikes.

While the U.N. is authorized
to sanction air strikes against the
Serbs for raiding the weapons fa-
cility, it is clear that the interna-
tional community is content with

. simply containing the violence to

Bosnia-Herzegovina and has lost
the will to enforce peace.

As the Serbs and Muslims gear
up for a renewal of all-out warfare,
the commander of the Muslim
Bosnian army General Rasim Delic
boasts that his forces are ready to
take back Serb occupied territories
which include 70 percent of Bosnia.

General Delic has a standing
army of 140,000 soldiers compared
to the 85,000 armed Serb soldiers.
However, the Serbs have a signifi-
cant advantage in equipment be-
cause of its illegal trade with Middle
Eastern countries.

With a U.S. presidential race
on the horizon, G.O.P. front run-
ner Senator Bob Dole has been
outspoken about lifting the arms
embargo on Bosnia and allowing
the two sides to fight the war out on
even terms. Speaker Newt
Gingrich has expressed his full
support for the Senate Majority
Leader on this issue.

Secretary of State Warren
Christopher fears that this “war
strategy” could eventually lead to
the deployment of U.S ground
forces. Many in the press have Iso
criticized Dole for campaigning
early on an issue on which he does

not intend to follow up should he
be elected in 1996.

Regardless, Dole’and the Re-
publican party have sought to de-
crease U.S. funding for U.N. peace-
keeping missions. In addition,
current legislation seeks to decrease
restrictions on presidential powers
to deploy troops set forth in the
War Powers Resolution, which was
passed in the wake of the Vietnam
War.

As the Bosnian conflict nears
its fourth year, Western Europe
and the United States are at a loss
to find a negotiable peace. With
last month’s indictments of Serb
executioners and documented war
crimes by the U.S. State Depart-
ment as early as the summer of

1992, it is becoming painfully ob-
vious that this war will plague our
consciences for many years to
come.

NOTES

Gennifer Flowers says
Clinton certainly did inhale

New York— Gennifer Flowers knew Bill Clinton as an occa-
sional marijuana smoker who carried his own joints and once talked
about getting high on cocaine, according to excerpts from her new
book in New York magazine

“By the way, he most certainly did inhale,” Flowers writes in
Passion & Betrayal.

When asked about the book Saturday, Clinton spokesman Mike
McCurry said, “The White House is not going to comment on any
cash-for-trash stories.” Clinton denies Flowers’ claim that they had
a 12-year affair ending in 1989.

over access to European fishing grounds.

with flour as he returned to his car, which was then blocked by
demonstrators. Police arrestedtwomen.
