Noted as being a hard worker
Pritchett works against adversity

By STAN BROWN
Staff Writer

Davidson’s new head bas-
ketball coach, Dave Pritchett,
is noted for being a hard
worker.

It’s fortunate that he likes
to work because he is faced
with the task of directing a
basketball team that has ta-
ken more than its share of
lumps in the past two years.

When asked if he felt a great
deal of pressure to turn the

Wildcats into a winner over-.

night, Pritchett said, ‘‘No, the
only real pressure I feel is the
pressure I put on myself.’’ He
feels that the team will be
much improved this year, but
each year will get increasingly
better.

The key to getting better is
recruiting. Successful recrui-
ting is dependent on a great

deal of hard work and a
quality product to offer. Prit-
chett’s reputation for the for-
mer is well-established and so
is Davidson’s for the latter.

“Davidson is special. When
you look at the doctors and
successful people that have
played here in the past, you
can offer something with qual-
ity.”

Coach Pritchett has eyes set
right at the top of the recrui-
ting charts. He plans on
signing his share of the top-
notch high school seniors in
the country.

‘For every 20 kids, there
will only be one we can go
after. That means it will take
us a little longer to turn things
around, but we'll do it.”’

Already well on the road in
recruiting for next year, Prit-
chett has a typically attractive
schedule to offer. Notre Dame,

Pifle-team outshoots A&T

during season’s first match

By TOM NIBLOCK
Staff Writer

Davidson’s rifle team open-
ed its season with a win over
North Carolina A&T at
Greensboro last Saturday,
overpowering their opponents
by a score of 1248 to 1068.

Senior Ben Simms and ju-
nior Tom Miller tied for the
high match score with 252 out
of a possible score of 300.
Sophomore Tom Niblock was
close behind with a score of
251.

Forest, Duke, Ohio State, St.
John’s, South Carolina and
Brigham Young are names to
attract any player.

Missing from the starting
ranks of last year’s team are
Tom Dore and Jim Rice. In
playing that impressive sche-
dule their absence will be felt.
Coach Pritchett expressed dis-
appointment at not getting an
opportunity to work with the
7’2” Dore.

“‘T also hated to lose Jim
Rice. He was a positive force
on the team. You can’t meas-
ure the value of a Jim Rice
with statistics. He’s just a
great kid.”

Coming back for the 1976-77
season is last year’s leading
scorer and a member of the

Another sophomore, Bob
Shoulders, posted a 249 while
senior Rob Mitchell rounded
out Davidson's top five with a
244,

Mitchell and Niblock tied
for the match’s high prone
scores with almost-perfect
97s. Tom Miller fired an 88 for
the number one spot kneeling
and Ben Simms’ 78 wa the
high standing score.

Other Wildcat shooters were
sophomore Andrew MacDon-

ald posting a 238, freshman

Robert Kirkendol with a 225,

Southern Conference’s all-
rookie team, John Gerdy.
Kevin Doherty is one of the
few upperclassmen. Pritchett
is looking for him to use some
of the physical tools he showed
as a freshman.

Pat Hickert and Tom Jor-
genson have game experience
from their freshman year and
Marvin Lively and Jerry Stall-
worth will captain the team as
seniors.

The strength of the team is
its commitment and pride.
They work hard and despite a
lack of size, hope to start back
toward the Davidson basket-
ball traditions of the past.
Having Pritchett at the helm
will mean the team stresses
hard work.

sophomore Kathérine Whitney
with a 216, and freshman Mike
Pearson with a 205.

With seven returning letter-
men and many strong fresh-
man prospects, including a
handful of women, Coach Jer-
ry Flannigan looks forward to
a good year.

“We posted a 13-10 winning
season last year with a young
team,’ commented Flannigan.
“This year’s challenging 30-
match schedule should prove
even more successful,’’ he
said.

The Rifle Team competes in
both the Southern Conference
and the Western Carolina
Conference, against such for-
midable schools as the Citadel
and nationally ranked Appa-
lachian State.

“Having a winning rifle
team doesn’t come easy,” says
Flannigan. ‘It requires work
and lots of it. Our team has
worked hard and it’s going to
pay off. We’re going to beat
some teams that aren’t ex-
pecting to be beaten.”

The: Rifle Team’s next
match will be a seven-way
Western Carolina Conference
meet to be held at Davidson on
Friday and Saturday, October
29 and 30. Participating
schools will be Davidson,
Clemson, Wofford, Appalachi-
an State, Presbyterian, Wake
Forest and South Carolina
State.
