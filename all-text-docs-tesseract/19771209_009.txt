Davidson students eating at
Slater use 15,000 plastic cups
a week. Because of the serious
environmental complications
related to production of plas-
tic, as well as those of solid
waste disposal, a group of
concerned students is working

to reduce this huge figure,

Plastic is generally non-bi-
odegradable and thus a pollu-
tant; it may be burned, but in
most cases forms a toxic gas.
Moreover, plastic is a petro-
chemical, very significant in
light of our dwindling energy
supplies.

In 1973, the National
League of Cities declared solid
waste to be the most urgent
issue cities face, and predicted
half the nation’s cities would
exhaust their disposal capaci-

pounds of trash per person per
