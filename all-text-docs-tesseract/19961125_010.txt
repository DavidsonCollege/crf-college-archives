From Rodeo to Rhapsody

Davidson College Symphony Orchestra joins with Chamber Singers to delight audience

By JENNIFER CARLSON
Guest Writer

Thursday, November 21, The
Davidson College Symphony Or-
chestra performed their 1996 Fall
Concert in Love Auditorium. Con-
ducted by Richard Prior, DCSO
masterfully executed four works
of “An American Agenda,” Paul
Creston’s Fantasy for Trombone
and Orchestra, Op. 42, Igor
Stravinsky’ s Symphony of Psalms;
Aaron Copland’s “Hoe-Down”
from Rodeo; and George
Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue.

Applause from the large audi-
ence coupled with the stomping of
feet from DCSO members warmly
welcomed Prior to the podium.
Prior in turn introduced senior
Steven Duncan, the featured trom-
bone soloist in the performance of
the first piece of the evening,
“Creston’s Fantasy.” Creston com-
posed this work in three sections,
the first of which is fast-tempoed
and rhythmic.

The orchestra thus opened

with an initial underlying rhythm °

while Duncan commanded a per-
formance of great technical skill.
During the slower middle section,

the soloist seemed to sustain notes
effortlessly, creating a beautiful
melody which captivated the audi-
ence. The “Fantasy” concluded
with fast, complex rhythms and
melodies introduced in the open-
ing. Duncan maintained remark-
able endurance through the final
measure, continuously distinguish-
ing his notes and rhythmic pattern
from those of the orchestra.

For Prior and the entire or-
chestra, the “Fantasy” was without
a doubt a brilliant performance.
For Duncan, moreover, it proved
to be a successful and appropriate
dedication to a friend of his who

had recently passed away.

The performance of the sec-
ond piece, Stravinsky’s Symphony
of Psalms, combined the talents of.
the Davidson College Chamber

Singers with those of the Sym-
phony Orchestra. The Chamber

Singers, directed by Donna M. Di
Grazia, enveloped the solemn yet
peaceful mood of the work by sing-
ing the Latin texts of three Psalms.

The orchestra complemented
the singing with their own musical
expressions. Of particular interest
were the flute and oboe sections
which performed a pleasing duet
during the first Psalm. The final
movement, however, best exem-
plified the interaction of the or-
chestra and Chamber Singers.
While the instrumentalists per-
formed various rhythmic sections,

_ the Singers echoed with celebratory

“Alleluias” of Psalm 150, thus end-

ing the first half of the evening.

Spirited red bandannas tied to
the cellos and basses set the mood
for the animated “Hoe-Down”
which began the second half.
DCSO’s performance of Copland’s
famous final episode from the bal-
let Rodeo proved to be an uplifting
treat for the whole audience.

A variety of percussion in-
struments, including a wood block,
bass drum, and cymbals, aided in
vibrant rhythmic explosions that
had listeners tapping their feet. By
the end of the performance, one
couldn’t help but hum the square-
dance melodies evoked in the cel-
ebrated work (and at the same time
by reminded of those American
“Beef” commercials).

The evening concluded with
an exceptional performance of
Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. This
work also featured the talents of a

solo artist, Davidson’s Cynthia
Lawing, on piano.

At Prior’s cue, clarinetist Jill
Williams played the memorable
opening notes of this piece. Shortly
thereafter, the orchestra joined in
and Lawing attacked the keyboard.

Rhapsody in Blue incorporates
several rhythmic patterns, demand-
ing the utmost control and persis-
tence of the pianist.

Lawing demonstrated such
ability with her incredible techni-
cal skill and careful focus on dy-
namics. :

Moreover, accurate pedaling
and phrasing enabled Lawing to
successfully command her play-

ing while the orchestra sounded its
own rhythms.

With jazzy interludes from
the wind and brass sections, enthu-
siastic percussion responses, and
superb piano playing, DCSO and
Lawing achieved a highly esti-
mable performance of and Ameri-
can classic.

The Davidson College Sym-
phony Orchestra will perform next
December 11 with organist Jane
Cain in Davidson College Presby-
terian Church.

Congratulations’ to Richard
Prior and all DCSO members for a
truly successful Fall 1996 Con-
cert.

What happened beyond

Poet Jane Mead Reads in the 900 Room

By GeorpDIE SCHIMMEL
Guest Writer

Jane Mead, poet-in-residence
at Wake Forest, read from her po-
ems Friday evening in the 900
Room to a small, informal audi-
ence. Among other accolades,
Mead has received the 1995
Kathryn A. Morton Prize in Po-
etry, given by Philip Levine, for
her book The Lord and General
Din of the World. Philip Levine
wrote that the poet’s language does

‘ not creep across the page to enter-
tain; rather “it prefers to leap out of
its own darkness with the sudden-

‘ness of something wild and catch
us by the throat.”

Butupon hearing Mead speak,
_ it became obvious that the matter

j was. more abqut her, throat...

jours: her voice, at once iate

and subtly sonorous, seemed also
far-off, musically distant, and quiet,
perhaps too quiet for those seated
in the back rows. Her cadences
were sfmilarly unsettling and un-
familiar, Mead’s lines sounded
occasionally fluid and voluble, and
occasionally as though each indi-
vidual word within the phrase were
itself an urgent utterance. Were ...
itself ... an ... urgent ... utterance.
The book is structured some-
what like a triptych, with a sort of
introductory poem or proem set-
ting the tone for the three sections
following, all of which concern the
poet’s drug rehabilitation, father,
home, etc. The sections range in

tone dramatically. The first can be ©

comprised by one word: interro-

gating. Nearly every other poem -

remarks in his introduction to the
book, that the poet is asking the
fundamental question of whether
we should live or not. The poems
in the first section nearly prickle

over with slings and arrows, outra-

geously.

In the second section, the po-
ems begin to assert themselves over
their events, in a manner of speak-
ing. The poems are less to than
they are for. Similarly, the vast
question taken up by the first sec-
tion begins here to find its answer:
we should live, for the detail, for
the music in our own conditions.

The third section is not
jubliant. But it is as jubliant as the

it to be. The poet’s voice becomes
unmuddied and positive, in the
