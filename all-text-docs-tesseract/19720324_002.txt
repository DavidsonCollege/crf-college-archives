SGA Report Suggests
End To Football Aid

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

The Student Government As-
ciation (SGA) Committee on
‘ootball has released its re-
oort, and it recommends that
ividson establish a non-sub-
lized football program.

Under the non-subsidized plan,

» football grants-in-aid per se

ould be given, either through
ne college or the Wildcat Club.

All students, including those
laying football, would then re-

eive aid based on need through
he Financial Aid Office. How-
ever, basketball scholarships
vould continue.

The college would continue to
pay for expenditures in excess
of income for the operating bud-
set, but non-subsidization would
mean that Davidson would have
to probably leave the Southern
Conference in football, while
staying in for other sports.

Non-subsidization would mean
that a new schedule with nen-
subsidized teams would have to
be devised.

Under the present funding
system, Davidson contributes a
certain amount of money for
use as football grants-in-aid
(scholarships) to attract foot
ball players to Davidson. Not
all players receive these grants,
and, as a rule, those who do re-
ceive no aid from the Financial
Aid Office.

In addition to the scholarship
money, the college also picks
up the tab of expenditures in
excess of income for the pro-
gram.

Davidson gives scholarships
for football on a formula which
takes the total amount of gift aid
(scholarships and work study
that the Financial Aid Office
gives) for all students per year,
and divides that total by the
number of students receiving
that aid, this result being the
average gift aid per student re-

ceiving aid.

Only about 30 per cent of Da-
vidson students receive gift aid,
and for 1971-1972 the average
scholarship is $900. According
to the formula, this is multi-
plied by 52 to get the total
amount of college contribution
to grants-in-aid for football. Thus
the college gave $47,000 this
year.

The Wildcat Club was estab
lished to raise funds for foot-
ball scholarships, and its goal is
to raise at least $170,000 or the
equivalent of 52 full scholar-
ships.

The Wildcat Club raised $83.-
000 in 1970 and the college was
forced to donate an extra $40,-
000 to maintain the scholarship
level of previous years. In 1971
$107,000 was raised and the col-
lege kicked in an added $15,000.

The Committee on Football
considered increasing the sub-
sidy to football, decreasing. it,
going to ncu-susidization and
elimination of intercollegiate
football. It found the largest
cost variable, except for the
last, to be the amount of money
given over to scholarships.

The  non-subsidization plan
was adopted because one of the
benefits would be a net financial
savings. The $47,000 college con-
tribution for scholarships would
be eliminated. This would be
partially offset by a $27,000 in-
crease in financial aid based on
need for an anticipated addi-
tional 30 students who would
qualify.

An alumni poll showed that
non-subsidized football would
cause 13.5 per cent of the alum-
ni to give more in unrestricted
funds, 19.3 per cent would give
less, and 67.2 per cent would not
change their giving. A slight
drop in giving initially could be
expected, but with time perhaps
a return to the previous level
would occur as time mellows
any antagonism.

On the other hand, the results
could be interpreted as mean-
ing most alumni would transfer
their giving from football to the
unrestricted category and that
there would thus be a net gain.

Based on cotrespondence with
Washington and Lee, which has
a non-subsidized football pro-
gram, it can be assumed that
no expense items except schol
arships would change.

In a survey of students, 55.3
per cent favored non-subsidiza-
tion and 13.8 per cent favored
the elimination of football.

The present subsidization pro
gram was found unsatisfactory
by some because Davidson can.
not compete successfully in the
Southern Conference. It was
pointed out that Davidson is the
lowest subsidized team in the
conference, and this inhibits Da-
vidson’s comparative ability to
recruit.

The Student Senate will dis-
cuss the report at its next meet-
ing.

NOT EXACTLY SPRING CLEANING

This was the scene at Duke Dormitory last Saturday morning out-
side the room of John McLean and Jim Milsop where a fire
broke out shortly after 8:30 a.m. After summoning the fire de
partment, a group of the dorm residents attempted to put oul the
fire using fire extinguishers from around the halls. However only
two of them worked properly so the fire department had to ex-
tinguish the blaze. Fire officials unofficially attributed the cause
to either a cigarette or match. A preliminary estimate from the
Physical Plant office guesses the room damage to be $1000.09, not

including personal items.

Senate Protests Detention Of
Coeducation Finance Report

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

In the only significant action
of this week's session, the Sen-
ate passed a resolution Wednes-
day protesting the ‘“‘lack of ac-
ticn of the Budget, Building and
Grounds Committee (BBG) to-
wards some constructive recom-
mendations on the feasibility of
coeducation at Davidson Col-
lege.”

The resolution was specifical-
ly directed toward the commit-
ee’s Subcommittee on Coeduca-
tion, stating that ‘“‘this group
appears to be the only holdup in
concrete progress towards co-

education at
year.”

The resolution also stated that
the SGA could find ‘‘no valid ex-
cuse for the delay’, and that
the delay was unnecessary.

The Senate’s action was pre-
cipitated by the failure of the
BBG to present its report of the
financial implications of going
coed next year at the last meet-
ing of the EPC subcommittee
on coeducation.

Earlier in the meeting, EPC
member Dick Clay reported on
the EPC’s actions and express-
ed disappointment that the com-
mittee had failed to prepare the
report in time for the last EPC

The final expenditure will be
for construction of a road be-
hind the gym (cost $1500) to be
used as an entrance to the col-
lege from Concord Street. This
is necessary because the road
behind the Union will no longer
be accessible once construction
of the library begins.

Cornell announced that he had
informed the Admissions Com-
mittee that there must be 1080
students on campus at the start
to the next school year to make
the budget balance. This is tak-
ing into account an _ attrition
loss of 50 throughout the year.)

“This will give us $2.4 million
from students in the form of
the comprehensive fee. We are
planning on this to help keep
the budget in the black next
year,” he said.

Cornell also explained the
breakdown for the tuition in-
crease is $185 for tuition and
fees, $15 for laundry services
and $25 for board.

The $15 laundry increase will

allow the laundry to function on
a break-even proposition instead
of losing money as it has the
past two years. (The laundry
will lose approximately $9,000
this year.)

meeting.

The resolution was placed on
the floor by SGA Vice President
Bob Cunningham. Debate on the
question centered on the effec-
tiveness of the action.

Bob Corlew argued that per
haps the resolution would have
no positive effect, and that
“maybe we shouldn’t antago-
nize them”. He pointed to Pres-
ident Spencer’s assurance that
the report would be presented
in the next meeting.

Bill Rolland countered that
“the effect is not the most im-
portant thing. What is at issue
is whether you agree with the
resolution. The important thing
is that we take a stand on the
problem.”

SGA President Ralph Pee-
ples pointed out that each de-
lay in the coeducation study
creates more difficulty for the
Admissions Office.

The resolution was passed by
a vote of 13-0 with two absten-
tions.
