Wake Forest Secures Close Decision
In Intercollegiate Debate at Raleigh

Lively Debate on Cancellation of United States War Loans to Allies Held at
Meredith College—Davidson Men Put Up Strong Fight

On Friday night, April 15th, at the
Meredith College auditorium in Ral-
eigh, Wake Forest and Davidson met in
the sixth of the series of intercollegiate
debates between the two colleges. Wake
Forest was represented by Messrs. L.
M. Butler and R. S. Averitt, with Mr.
Hugh E. Monteith as alternate and busi-
ness manager. Davidson was represent-
ed by Bitzer and Gamble, with Dwight
Miller as alternate and business man-
ager.

The query was, “Resolved, That the
United States should cancel the loans
made to her allies during the great
war,”
firmative.

Bitzer and Gamble based their con-
tention for the cancellation of the debts,
which total approximately ten billion
dollars, on the moral duty of the United
States to cancel because the Allies had
to bear by far the larger part of the
cost of the war in men and money and
property losses; on the political advis-
ability of cancellation, in that it would
help unite the Allies in requiring full
settlement by Germany, strengthen the
ties between the United States and the
Allies, and restore to the United States
her moral leadership of the world; and
on the economic need and wisdom of

«, cancellation due to the facts that the
Allies need cancellation, the U. S. can-
not afford to cancel, and the U. S. can-
not afford not to cancel for she needs
to have trade resumed to relieve busi-
ness depression in this country.

Messrs. Butler and Averitt contended
that the United States had done her
part, that cancellation was not a proper
way to win the friendship of the Allies,
that it would not furnish proper relief,
and that it would put an undue burden
on the American tax-payer.

The speeches were on the whole well
delivered. The rejoinders were very
spicy and with one exception § the
bell found the debaters anxious to pro-
ceed with the discussion. Each team
made a strong effort to win the ap-
proval of the audience and especially of
the judges, but the Wake Forest stvic
of debate proved to be more “taking.”

The local men report a fine trip. They

Varsity Down Scrubs in

Spring Football
Practice

Brown, Shepard and I and Bethea Do Star
Work—Prospects Good for

Strong Team

The football Scrubs went down in de-
feat before the terrific onslaught of the
Varsity by the score of 35 to o Saturday
afternoon. Although the Kittens put up
a hard and scrappy fight, the game was
the Varsity’s from beginning to end,
the ball seldom staying in their terri-
tory for any length of time and not
once did the Scrubs threaten to score.

First blood was drawn by the Wildcat
machine when “Rooster” McFadden.
dashed across the line for a touchdown
in the first quarter. No other scoring
was done until in the second quarter
Gig Shepherd, stiff-arming right and
left, ran 20 yards for an additional seven
points. The half closed with the ball in
the possession of the Scrubs near the
center of the field.

The second half opened with McFad-
den kicking off to Overton, who return-
ed the ball five yards. However, the
Scrubs were soon forced to punt after
several failures to gain and Leonard
Dick reeled off two long runs in succes-
sion which added another touchdown to
the credit of the Varsity.

The most sensational event of the
game came in the fast quarter when Mc-
Fadden passed 25 yards with the ac-
curacy of a rifle to Schenck, who dash-
ed 35 yards, dodging and twisting at
every step, until he had placed the ball
between the goal posts. After a few |
minutes of play Gig Shepherd scored his
second touchdown of the evening and
the final whistle blew shortly after-
wards.

The success of the Varsity was largely
due to the work of McFadden, Shep-
herd, and Schenck, while Brown and
Moore, W. W., put up the best fight for
the Scrubs.

OFFICERS ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION CHOSEN
FOR COMING YEAR

Last week the officers for the Athletic
Association for next year were elected.
“Rooster” McFadden was elected presi-
dent; Sam Davis, vice-president, and
Elias Faison, secretary. .

McFadden got a majority in the first
ballot, but both the others had to run
the second time. The vice-presidency
lay between Davis and W. S. Sheperd,
while Faison and Cox were high men
in the first ballot for secretary. The
elections were close and there was a
great deal of interest shown. These men
are all wearers of the “D” and it is cer-
tain that our Athletic Association is in
good hands for the ensuing year.

Those nominated for president were:
McFadden and LaFar; for vice-presi-
dent, Davis, Shepard and Ogden; for
secretary, Cox, Faison, Jones, R. R., and
Beaver. .

Pre-Eminent Importance

of Soul Subject of Y
Service---Address

by Chalmers

Students Glad to Hear Their Y. M. C.
A. Secretary and are Great-
ly Benefited

“Tho world on world in myriad myriads
roll

Round us, each with different powers

And other forms of life than ours

What know we greater than our soul?”

These lines express the theme of the
talk by Dwight Chalmers, General Sec-
retary of the Davidson Y. M. C. A, at
the regular Sunday night meeting. Ue
began by pointing out that we could nat
lightly consider our souls because of
their intangibility. Electricity, energy,
gravitation, and our minds are all alike
invisible and intangible, but we kuow
they are.real because of their effects.

Likewise we cannot explain ourselves
without our souls. Man’s longing for
something higher, his instinctive ad-
sniration of goodness, purity, truth,
honor, and his feeling of love can never
be explained in a materialistic or logi-
cal way. Genesis 2:7 gives the only ex-
planation of man that has ever been
satisfactory.

Most of us admit the reality of our
souls, the speaker continued, but we balk
at their supreme importance. There can
be no question as to their importance
because first of all they are immortal.
Then again, to neglect them is to live a
life of failure and disappointment. Many
instances were cited by Dwight of men
who had sought honor, wealth, self-in-
dulgence, or power only to acknowledge
failure later on.

And finally, the life, death and teach-
ings of Jesus prove conclusively the im-
portance of the soul. The speaker told
of a math. professor who asked the
brightest student in his class to solve

Sigma Sigma Up silon Initiates Initiates
New Men by Inter-

esting Stunts

Six Men of Literary Aims Received
Into Blue Pencil Club

The Sigma Upsilon Literary Fraternity
initiated six new members at the meet-
ing held last Wednesday night. Those
initiated at that time were: Ray
Doubles, Roderick Shaw, James Sprunt,
J. C. Bailey, George Cornelson, and R.
R. McIlwaine. These men have all con-
tributed articles of merit for the pages
of the College Magazine as is required
before their election to this order.

In connection with the intiation the
newly elected members performed in
front of White Drug Store for the
amusement of the crowd, each one
dressed to represent some familiar char-
acter. Ray Doubles, dressed in blue
organdy, with broad leghorn hat and
representing the debutante of ten years,
was accompanied by Jim Sprunt, in short
trousers and sailor hat. R. R. McIlwaine
represented the modern “Fop” of the
seashore, while George Cornelson vivid-
ly portrayed the country lass. Rod
Shaw brought back memories of the
militant suffragette of ten years ago.
Demosthenes was represented by J. C.
Bailey in flowing robes of white and
with a laurel crown. This motley crowd
was then taken to the S. A. E. hall and
duly initiated, after which a feed was
enjoyed by all.

Tennis Match With Trin-
ity to be Held
Next Week

Cunningham, Morris, Ormond and
Roberts Win Places On Team.
Through Tournament

The championship in the tennis tour-
nament was won by Ed. Cunningham.
Playing against the best that Davidson
could offer, he came out on top by de-
feating Morris in the finals.

Those men making the team to rep-
resent the Wildcats this spring were:
Cunningham, Morris, Ormond, A. C.,
and Roberts. Due to illness, Bradly, one,
of last year’s representatives, was un-
able to play in the tournament but is to
be used in some of the meets this’ sea-
son, This is a well rounded bunch of
racket swingers, on whom Davidson is
depending for net honors.

A match has been arranged with Trin-
ity for next week. Very little can be
said as to the chance for a Wildcat vic-
tory, still it might be remembered that
Davidson triumphed over the Method-
ist team last year in a hotly fought
battle. However, Trinity took a match
from Wake Forest who in turn won
from Davidson later in the season. This
would make the matter rather com-
plicated. For this reason the match next
week will be watched with unusual in-
terest.

Several other matches have been
scheduled for the next few weeks, in-
cluding the S. I. A. A. tournament in
Atlanta some time in May. With this
outlook the team has gotten to work in
earnest. After a little more practice
great things can be expected from the
1921 tennis team.

RISING JUNIORS AND
SENIORS CHOOSE
CLASS OFFICERS

The rising Junior Class elected its of-
ficers for next year last Thursday morn-
ing after the chapel exercises.

The officers elected were as follows:
President, S. M. Davis; vice-president
R. F. Davidson; secretary and treasurer,
W. T. Elliott; student councilmen, C. D
Tuller, H. H. Smith and F. C. Thames.

At a meeting of the rising Senior Class
last Tuesday, T. M. Lowry was re-elect-
ed to lead the class for the second suc-
cessive year. The other two members
of the reigning trio are E. B. McGukin,
vice-president, and S. D. Story, secre-
tary.

It is certain that the destiny of such
an illustrious class will be guided in a
capable manner by the above named of-
ficers. The five student councilmen
elected were: J. P. Price, J. C. Bailey,
J. I. Knight, E. B. McGukin, and S. H.
Cornelson.

The editor-in-chief and business man-
ager of the 1922 Quips and Cranks were
also elected at this time, they being
Rod K. Shaw and Walter Knox, respec-
tively. .

The Davidson Christian Endeavor So-
ciety enjoyed a social last Friday even-
ing at the Potts home. There were
about 45 young people present. Various
games were enjoyed both indoors and
on the lawn.

The result of the games since the last
issue of The Davidsonian does not look
so well from the percentage standpoint
but with three of the games played on
the road against the strongest teams in
the state, and with a victory over the
University on their home grounds, there
is much room for encouragement. The
batting averages show that the team
has been doing some real clouting, and
with a few less sore arms and a bit
more luck the remaining games should
get on the right side of the ledger.

“Davidson Conquers Carolina in Great
Rally.”

After the Elon game, the Wildcats
went to Chapel Hill with the determina-
tion to “Beat Carolina,” and their de-
termination was fully carried out. When
ten innings of rather loose but desper-
ate playing had gone into the past,
Davidson showed the inhabitants of
Chapel Hill her true worth and ran off
with a nine to five victory which will
remain imprinted on the minds of the
students of the State school for many
days. It was not only meritorious for
our team to defeat the Tar Heels, but.
also to defeat them on their own
grounds, .

At the beginning of the eleventh in-
ning, the Carolina nine cracked under
the strain of Davidson's hitting, and the
victors sent five runs across the plate.
In this inning, Johnson and Ratchford
got on and then Fred Morris’ low throw
let in one run, sacrifice flies by Hodgin
and Cassel sent two more across, and
then Crawford, who was hitting fiercely
all afternoon, drove one through the
hedge in deep center for a home run,
scoring Brown ahead of him.

The proteges of Coach Hengevelt were
off to a flying start in the first when
sheppard’s triple after singles by Cas-
sel and Crawford sent two across. They
picked up two more in the fifth and
sixth, with Brown’s double featuring in
the sixth. Currie was meantime pitch-
ing masterly bail and could not be hit
