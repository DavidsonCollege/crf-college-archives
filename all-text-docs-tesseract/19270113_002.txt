Ushering in the new year with a series of |
victories Davidson athletic teams have en- |
tered upon a period that promises to exceed
even the most exultant hopes of many ardent |
Wildcats. The period of athletic contests is
rudely. broken by the ten-day stretch given
over to examinations the last of this month.

1926-27 basketball season by defeating Salis-

The scoring by the two teams was very
close during the whole game, there being no
big difference at any time in the number of
‘baskets made by the opposing teams.. How-
ever, the Wildcats set the pace during the
whole. game, keeping in the lead until by-ac-
curate shooting the visiting team tied the
score 31-31 in the last minute of play. At
this time, when a basket meant the game,

heartening than it would be otherwise. This
win is the second of the present season, the
strong Salisbury “Y” team falling before the
onslaught of the accurate shooting Captain

margin shortly before the holidays.

finally decided, it is highly probable that the

be the Davidson “Varsity” this season.
