“DAVIDSON GOLF TEAM
DEFEATS SALISBURY
COUNTRY CLUB.

Gastonia to Play Here Wednesday.

“Enthusiastic” describes well the
large gallery of spectators that
were out Saturday afternoon to
witness Davidson’s first golf tourna-
ment with the Salisbury Country
Club, The weather was fine for
golf and the course was in good
shape although in places quite
damp. This did not dampen the
play and interest however, and
evening.

Dr. McConnell and White played
an especially good game for David-
son. The former making the nine
holes in 42, closely followed by
White with a score of 43. The put-
ting of Dr. McConnell was uncanny,
entirely upsetting the visitors by
his play. The driving of White and
Hennesee was remarkable, their
long shots often bring applause
from the gallery.

Wednesday, April 7, the Gastonia
Country Club will send a team to
Davidson to play the local team.
Much interest is being shown in
this match and a large gallery is ex-
pected to attend. Throughout the
spring different teams will be
chosen and many _ interesting
matches are scheduled.

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle officiated very
ably as score keeper. Much credit
is due Dr. Arbuckle for his un-
tiring efforts for the success of the
Davidson Golf Club.

The individual scores follow:

Salisbury: Hennesee, 51; Pickens,
55; Walker, 56; Harding 69.

Davidson: Dr. McConnell, 42;
Prof. Wood, 51; H. White, 43; A. F.
Fricker, 53.

WILDCATS TO BATTLE WITH
FURMAN AND STATE.

The Pick of the Carolinas Will be
Met This Week. Team in
Good Trim.

_ Much interest is being directed
toward the game Thursday after-
noon between the Wildcats and
Furman, on the Davidson diamond.
During the past week the hitting
and fielding of the locals have been
even above the average. This will
be the first real inter-collegiate
game on the hill and one in which a
great deal of spirited rivalry is be-
ing manifested. The Presbyte-
tians hope to completely immerse
the visiting Baptists. With either
Currie or Miley on the mound Fur-
man must put up a good game to
uphold the record they have begun
by winning from Ga. Tech in the
past few days. .
N. C. State-Davidson

On next Saturday the entire stu-
dent body of Davidson is planning
to migrate to Charlotte to witness
the game between N. C. State and
Davidson. This promises to be a
hotly contested battle. North Caro-
lina State has recently beaten Le-
noir by a wide margin and all in-
dications are that-their team is up
to the standard. Comparative
scores this year seemingly have
failed. Davidson’s twirlers for this
game will be either Shepard or Cur-
rie and being backed by the fielding
of the two Cassells, Ratchford, Mc-
Arn, Crawford, Richards and Poe.

Wrenn, the steady Red and Black|pR oO

receiver will be behind the bat.

boxing or shoe pitching. He is a
champion in both.

John Pierpont Price is also a star
in the game, due to long practice
throwing quoits on a ship’s deck
enroute from Hong Kong to Los
Angeles. Besides the already men-
tioned outstanding experts, “Silver ,
Heels” Bradley and “Willie Bert-'
ram” Sullivan deserve honorable,
mention. If you are interested in a
game that is athletic, exciting, |
scientific, healthful and economic,
try horse-shoe pitching and enter.

Second of May.

TRUSTEES PLEASED WITH
R. O. T. C.

Capt. Mueller Congratulated
Splendid Exercises of Battalion.

The R. O. T. C. exercises. includ-
ing a Battalion Review for the in-
spection of the Board of Trustees,
were indeed a great success. The
trustees were so favorably impress-
ed that some of them almost reach-
ed the point of proposing a resolu-
tion that would make it essential
as a four year course for candidates
for degrees.

Rut they were very sensible
about the matter, much as they felt
it would be to the advantage of the
college in some ways. They passed
a resolution appointing Dr. Martin
to write a letter in hehalf of the
Board expressing their appreciation
to Capt. Mueller of his faithful work
and congratulating him on the
evident success of this unit. The
whole stuflent body is to be con-
gratulated also on this success.

These men, experienced in the
life of different professions, realize
the advantages of such training
which they had no opportunity to
receive. The essence oF all the best
in the system is to be had at the

.O. T. C. summer camp. The fel-
lows who want to get it direct can
do so during the six weeks from
June 17, to. Junl 28.

DIAMOND DUST

Only twenty men facer Shepherd
in the six innings he pitched against
Catawba. One visitor reached first
on an error and another reached
second on a double. “Shep” struck
four and walked none.

Miley finished the game, allowing
one hit and fanning five. Bill’s
mystery ball was again acting
queer.

Only three of the losers visited
the bases in the Saturday’s game.
One infield bingle and two doubles
was the extent of their offensive.

Atwell, for Catawba, doubled in
the first, but returned from the bag
a nervous wreck, It’s a shame the
way that Cassell, F., and Ratchford
pester visitors at the midway sta-
tion,

“Coach” Hengeveld’s aggregation
certainly worked the squeeze play
to perfection in the game. A regular
path was made from third to home
via this method as soon as a Wild-
cat perched at the hot corner.

Poe’s clutch at the ‘second has-
sock, in the eighth, after he had
over-slid it, reminded the Edward's
Club of a wet man’s grasp toward
a gin-rickey. Lots of ginger——?

Did you notice the one run chalk-
ed up on the scoreboard in the fifth
inning? Bet the youngster would
have gotten a hundred on his Ro-
man Numbers the next day, if his
teacher saw that.

Crawford had a perfect day at
the bat. The Sumter lad secured a
triple, a single, a walk, and a sacri-
fice in four trips to the plate.

Cassell, E only gets credit for one
official trip to the bat. “Vernon”
drew two passes and sacrificed once.

That we need a wire protection
in front of the bleachers was proven
beyond a doubt Saturday. It is
very embarrasing for the students
who bring members of the fair sex
to the game, to have to protect
them from wild throws.

“Caruso” McArn is surely sing-
ing a brilliant FIRST BASE on the
Wildcat nine.

The bleachers insist that one of
the Catawba substitutes played last
year on the Bloomer Girl’s team.

Where was the Band?
Sunday Ban Lifted.

Athletic equipment at Yale will be
accessible on Sundays as well as on
other days from now on. The ban
which has hitherto existed has been
lifted and students are free to in-
dulge in Sunday athletics.
