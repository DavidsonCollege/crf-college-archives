IMAC flickerball season fully underway

: “ By RICK CASE

The 1986 IMAC Flickerball season is .

now Officially underway, and already the
usual number of rule\ misunderstandings,
referree problems, and great games have
been accounted for.

To all people participating in this sea-
son’s action, here are some things to keep in
-mind to help the season go along a bit more

smoothly: the flickerball fields are desig-

nated non-drinking areas. Please do not
bring any sort of alcoholic beverage up to
the fields, as there has already been one un-
fortunate incident involving this rule. If you
think that alcohol enhances your playing
ability, please drink before the game.

Please go over any misunderstandings
you might have concerning the rules before
the game with your ref. There is an official
IMAC flickerball rulebook with every

equipment ‘bag if you need to check oh
something. Go easy on the referees during
the games, especially on things such as
whistling the play dead and spotting the
ball. These are judgement calls, and if
you're that serious about flickerball any-
way, you've got a problem. Concerning no
shows: if you are scheduled to referee a
game and neglect to show up, your team
loses its eligibility for tournament play. If
you pull a repeat performance, your team is
out of the league. History: Gonzo.

If you are scheduled to play either “I
Wanna Be Someplace Else,” or “Flickin’
Pax,” you will be awarded a ‘forfeit for that
game, as both teams have dropped out of
the league. Both teams, however, will
honor their refereeing responsibilities.

The deadline for roster addition is 4

p.m. Oct. 10. No exeptions will be allowed.

Game action began two weekends ago
with the annual exhibition match between
SAE’s and KA’s number one teams “Drop
and Give” and “KA Gold.” KA took a very
close game by the score of 39-32, with
sophomore Whit Wilkes catching three
touchdown passes for KA. This event was
for the freshmen to come out and see how
the game is played. I’m sure the four that
did show up got alot out of it.

Other league highlights: Sept. 28 —
Stob Session: defeated Red Garage Roof
despite a two-t.d. effort by freshman Tim
Sparks, and Rusk declawed the Crabs of
Warner Hall by the score of 37-0. Ruskies
sophomore -Sarah Whitesides and senior
Caryn Coppedge were game MVPs.

Friday , October a ‘1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

chmen 7. And in one of the best games of
the year so far, Students Against Butt Pi-
rates got rear-ended by the Ragin-Trajans
by the score of 17-13 despite an incredible
effort by senior Fletcher Fairey.

Oct. 5 — Warner Hall’s first team
won their game to remain undefeated, as
junior Trina “The Bear”. Morrison amd
junior Mary Erwin were chosen as out-
standing players. Also, the Ragin’ Trajans
beat the Damned Commanchees II by the
score of 12-0 on two touchdowns by senior
Rob Norman. 2

Please keep in mind the rules and sug-
gestions stated above and try to show up for
games on time and with your whole team. If
your whole team can’t make it, try to play

‘ with as many people as you have. Be nice to

the referees even if they are blind mutes,
and above all have a good season.
