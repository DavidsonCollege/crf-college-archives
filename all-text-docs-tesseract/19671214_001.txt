DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. 28036, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1967

Comparisons No Means
To Justify Vote — Outlaw |

By BOB TRAVERS
Associate Editor

Comparing Davidson to
other liberal arts colleges is
not a valid justification for
Tuesday's faculty action on
ROTC, Col. Frederick B. Oat-
law said Wednesday.

Outlaw, professor of mili-
tary science, declined further
comment on the faculty re-
commendation that ROTC be
made voluntary.

“There is no sense in try-
ing to compare Davidson. for
example, to Pomona on the
issue,”’ he said. “‘As the dean
of the faculty at a large mid-
western university said, ‘each

Library
Receives
$200,000

Davidson's drive to meet
a $1.5 million challenge grant
for a new library received a
substantial boost this week
with a challenge gift of $200
thousand.

The gift, made by the Rich-
ardson Foundation of Greens
boro, was given on the con
dition that Davidson meet
the $1.5 million ‘challenge
made by philanthropist E. H.
Little for the building of a
new library.

Little’s original gift of
$500 thousand was made soon
after the Board of Trustees
accepted the proposal to con-
struct a new library and
learning center for the col-
lege.

The Richardson Founda-
tion’s gift leaves $1.3 million

to be raised hy the college
in order to secure both
grants.

Robert J. Sailetad, direct-
or of public relations and
development. said that the
gift Witi “siact the ball rol-
ling’ in the college's fund
drive

The library, to be named
the E. H. Little Library, will
be built no later than June,
1970, vr as soon as the col-
lege can meet its challenge.

The gift to Davidson was
one of several made to North
Caroina colleges and uni-
versities this month by the
foundation, which also sup-
ports the Richardson Fellows
and Richardson Scholar pro-
gram for foreign students at
Davidson.

continued to grow following
selection of that site two
months ago by the Board of
Trustees.

“I don't like that site main-
ly because it’s too near the
dorms and the fraternity
court,” said Danny Layman,
the only student representa-
tive on the faculty Library
Committee.

The trustees’ decision Oct.
13 had seemingly ended sev-
eral months’ haggling over
the site. Also considered by
the board were sites across
Concord Road, in front of
Little Dormitory, between
the College Union and Duke
dormitory and the Guest
House site.

The Concord Road site had
been openly favored by both
the student body and the lib.
rary staff.

“The trustees selected the
Manor site because of its
proximity to centers of stu-
dent activity, its accessibili-
ty by road and because fu-
ture expansion might go in
that direction,"’ said Bill Bon-
durant, assistant to the Pres
ident.

Layman said, however,
“the site across Concord
Road would have placed the
library far enough away from
the living centers of the cam-
pus—the fraternities, the dor-
mitories—so that an atmos-
phere more conducive to
study could, have been ob-
tained.

“It would have been much
nicer esthetically, too, if it
had been placed across Con-
cord Road,” he added.

President Emeritus John
R. Cunningham, at a time
when the Guest House site
was under consideration, said
in a letter to a member of
the administration, “I would
dislike to see that corner of
the campus crowded with a
large building.”

In explaining why the
(See LIBRARY, Page Four)

school has its own modus
operandi.” *

He said he would not make
his position public until after
the trustees vote Dec. 20 to
confirm or reject the faculty
action.

“I don't want to put my
self in an untenable position
where I might be accused of
trying to influence the trus-
tees’ action."’ he said.

Outlaw answered questions
in a curt manner; he appear:
ed to be tired and in a dis.
gruntled mood.

If the trustees accept the
faculty decision, the college
must notify the Department
of the Army that it wishes to
negotiate a new contract:
the ROTE program will con
tinue to function for as long
as a year, according to the
present contract, unless a
new contract is negotiated,
said Outlaw.

The Army makes certain
requirements of a college
when it establishes a ROTC
program, he said. One of
those requirements is that
“appropriate academic”
credit be offered for the first
and second years of the pro-
gram.

“These are professional
aourses,"' he said, ‘and cer-
tain aspects must be main-
tained to avoid defeating the

purpose. Academic credit is
a necessity.

“I think these courses make
a contribution both to the
student and the college,’ he
said. ‘Of course what David-
son does is Davidson's busi
ness.""

In answer to a question
about ihe proposals to de-
velop a new program for
training potential officers,
Outlaw said, ‘I don't know
what they're talking about.”

Opposition Continues To Grow
In Spat Over Proposed ‘Dump’

Opposition of Davidson
Tesidents to the proposed
Concord Road iandfill and
garbage disposal area has
been increasing this week.

Bill Bondurant, assistant to
the president, is leading the
fight against the proposed
garbage dump location.

He said, ‘‘We have had a
meeting of some of the com-
munity leaders and discussed
our plans for the Town Coun-
cil hearing Friday night.”

“It now appears that we'll
have around 500 names on
the petition,’ said Bondurant,
who lives in the area and
has been circulating a peti-
tion against the Concord
Road site for the garbage
dump.

“Tl am delighted that we've
had such an impressive group
to sign the petition.” said
Bondurant. ‘I feel that if
we havea sizable portion.
of the signers attending the
hearing Friday night, it will
considerably improve our
chances to succeed.”

“It remains incredible to
me that one of the finest
residential areas in North
Mecklenburg County would
be selected for a dump." said
Bondurant. One of his prime
criticisms of the Concord
Road site is that land values
in the area would go down.

However, Dr. Jamcs G.
Martin, associate professor
of chemistry and chairman
of the County Commission.

ers, said that the land values
in the proposed landfill area
were very low anyway.
“There would be a lot of
truth to their fears about the
land values if the dump were
to be left unattended or if
the dump were to be left open
to the air,"’ Martin said.
Martin contends that the
landfill would be covered
over each day with about two

‘feet of soil. ‘There isn't any

development in the area now
and there aren't any plans
for one. This is about as iso-
lated an area as you will
find in the county.”’ Martin
said.

“On the question of this
project's preventing growth
of the town in that direction,”

Martin continued. “I don't
know if anyone should really
offer an opinion on that
question.

“I don't expect any growth
in that direction for the next
six or eight years anyway,
which is the projected time
span of the project,’ he add-
ed.

“I've looked at five other
sites in northern Mecklen
burg County, and so far I
have been unable to buy any
property from their owners,”
said Martin.

“You don't solve the prob-
lem of where to put the land
fill by just wishing if off on
somebody else. and we just
don't have any large ex-

APO gathered information
about each of the families:
the number of children, their
ages, clothing sizes, likes,
dislikes and their needs.

With this information. Seig-
ler said, he hopes to be able
to purchase gifts that will be
needed and wanted.

The money for the project
was raised from the David-
son student body. Seigler
said that he asked each of
the 12 fraternities to sponsor
one family.

The Freshman Class con-
ducted a room-to room drive
and came up with enough

money to sponsor five fam-
ilies, and the Independents’
donations provided for an-
other five.

Seigler said that he hopes
that $15, along with a lot of
economizing, will cover the
cost of the things he wants
to purchase for the families.

“I'm going to use every
trick I know to make this
money last,"’ he said.

He said that he hopes he
can get discounts on the
items he is purchasing. “I'm
depending heavily on the
good will of a lot of busi-
nesses,'' he said.

Student Critics
Mit Constitution

By BILL WARREN
"Staff Writer

Criticism of the draft of the
Student Body Constitution re-
leased last week has centered
around jits court system and
its Bill of Rights, according
to. members of the commit-
tee that prepared it.

Reactions from. students to
the new Constitution, how
ever, are“ generally good.”
said Franklin Anderson. sec.
retary of the Constitution Re
vision Committee.

Anderson said that the Sen
ate and the Executive Com-
mittee have been well re
ceived, and that the only
criticism of them that he
knows of lies in ‘‘the setting
of a definite number of peo
ple as senators representing
the residence halls."

He added that he has not
heard any criticism of Arti-
cle V, which is entitled ‘‘Ref-
erendum, Adoption. Revis-
ion.”

Harrison Higgins, one of
two freshmen on the Consti
tution Revision Committee.
said that although most
freshmen backed the new
Constitution, some have criti-
cized the Court of Appeals
and have wondered “how
much it would be used and
whether its power is justified
since its members are ap-
pointed.”

He added. however, that
most freshmen felt that “the
idea of a student Court of
Appeals was good.”

According to Higgins, many
freshmen “‘criticized the use
of legalistic language” in the
new Constitution and felt
that ‘‘some of the passages
are not necessary nor do
they mean anything.”

The second sentence of Ar-
ticle III, Part 3, Section B
concerning the general the-
ory governing the Honor Sys-
tem has been criticized as
being unnecessary.

This sentence reads, ‘Since
Davidson strives to be a
Christian College. and thus
recognizes a need for under
standing and compassion as
well as for justice and honor.
the Honor Court shall admin
ister the honor system by in
stilling in students an aware
ness of the basic principles of
honor and by enforcing its
decisions as it sees fit in the
light of éach individual case.”

culty, rests with the Board
of Trustees, which will meet
here Dec. 20.

In its final report to the
faculty last month, the Biue
Sky Committee had conclud-
ed that military science ‘‘is
not.compatible with the ideal
of the liberal arts and ought
not to be required of any-
one.”

Its recommendations asked
that:

—Academic credit be limit-
ed to the advanced program.

The basic program be of-
fered on a voluntary basis
and without academic credit.
_—The college exptore the
possibility of completing the
basic program in one term
and offering it as late as the
junior year.

-—Davidson ‘‘take the lead
in exploring the possibilities
of establishing a more effi-
cient method of training of.
ficer potential outside the
curriculum than we now have
in the ROTC program."

All ROTC recommenda
tions were accepted by the
faculty, contingent upon the
assent of the Department of
Defense.

“We'll have to wait and
see if the Defense Depart-
ment will approve of what we
want to do before we can set
it up.’ said Dr. Frontis W.
Johnston, dean of the faculty.

If the proposal is approved
by both the trustees and the
Defense Department, the
ROTC change would go into
effect next fall.

Faculty deliberation on. the
matter Tuesday lasted over
an hour and a half, Johnston
said. The recommendation.
which was the only item on
the faculty agenda, was pre
sented by Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts.

ROTC was established at
Davidson in 1919. when a
“Student Army Training
Corps’ started béfore World
War I was formalized.

The only other compulsory
ROTC program in North
Carolina is at A & T Univer
sity in Greensboro.
