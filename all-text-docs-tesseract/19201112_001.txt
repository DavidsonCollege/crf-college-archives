EU. SOCIETY ELECTS
MID-TERM OFFICERS

The regular fall election of officers
took place in the Eumenean Society last
Saturday night. The attendance was
scanty, there being little more than a
quorum present. Mr. Wade (Ox) Har-
rell was present and between ballots
gave some reminiscences of his career
in the society.

‘Those elected’ were: J. R. Boulware,
Jc. president; P. D. Miller, vice-presi-
dent; H. H. Smith, secretary, and Wm.
P. Cumming, reviewer.

The marshals for the various society
functions were also elected. J. C. Mc-
Caskill was elected chief marshal, with
McGukin, Richards, Lowry and Mitchell
as marshals on his staff.

Boulware made a few remarks about
the future work and aims of the society
under his administration. As the so-
ciety is adjourned until two weeks, no
program for future performances was
read.

‘ Fresh mocecron ne eee id 333 *! De. W. S. Currell, former Davidson

. Seniors oon ee a ; ‘ 000 : professor, president of the University of

South Carolina, delivered an address Jast
Sunday evening on the Yodel Bible
Reader to the local congregation of
town people and college students.

Beginning with the statement that
God had written three great books,
Nature, Conscience, and the Bible, it
was shown the Bible is really the book
for us, the true guide of dur lives, telling
us from whence we have come, whither
we are going, and how we may best
serve God. .

The Bible is the universal book, and
is sufficient for the greatest minds as
well as for those of humbler gifts, for it
is so deep that the profoundest intel-
tects have not been able to plumb its
depths, so lofty that the greatest minds
are unable to attain its wunscalable
heights, and so broad that none have
been able to comprehend it in its en-
tirety.

Every real problem met by the Chris-
tian can be solved by the Bible and
prayer. Are we discouraged, tired of
trying? “Be not discouraged; for in
due season ye shall reap if ye faint not.”
Are we worried over what is before us,
do we fear for the future? “Cast all your
care upon Him, for He careth for you.”
. To really obtain the true good coming
from Bible reading man must read with
an open mind and with his whole soul
intent upon the searching of the Scrip-
tures; he must read carefully and defi-
nitely; he must read daily; and last of
all he must read spiritually, for the
things of the spirit can be only spirit-
ually discerned.

According to Coleridge, there are
three great classes of readers, and hear-
ers may be classified likewise:

Senior-Fresh Game.

The Fresh displayed a complete re-
versal of form against the Seniors Fri-
day night compared with that shown
against the Sophs, and as a result sent
the upperclassmen down in defeat 23 to
21. In the first few minutes of play, the
Fresh opened up an attack that swept
the Seniors off their feet, and it was
with much difficulty that the upperclass-
men succeeded in stopping them. After
the first rush the Seniors settled down
and first half closed, the Fresh leading
with the score 9 to 3. McConnell, of the
Freshmen, made most of the counters.

The second frame opened with an on-
slaught by the Fresh, Pitts having led
the attack. After ringing up three goals
in rapid succession the Fresh took a
rest.

The ‘Seniors, staging a grand come-
back, led by King and Heizer, brought
the score up to 17 all. With five more
minutes to play both teams buckled
down to real basketball. The Fresh then
shot three goals which seemed to startle
the Seniors for a short while.

With about two minutes of play left,
the Seniors began a strong offense, but
were unable to register more than
two goals before the last whistle.

The game was lacking along certain
lines of spectacular play, but in spite of
this, both teams put up a scrappy fight.
Ormond, A. P., led the Senior offensive
and was conspicuous in floor work. Mc-
Connell, for the Fresh, put up the best
exhibition for the winners. The result
could not be determined until the final
blast of the whistle.

The scoring was as follows:

Seniors. Position. Freshmen. (1) The hour-glass readers—those who

When Wildcats Meet
Tarheels
Return of Regulars to Davidson’s

Line-up Brings Added Hopes
to Her Supporters

Coach Fuller’s men from Chapel Hill
will meet Coach Grey’s Wildcats on a
neutral field in Winston-Salem, Satur-
day afternoon.

Both teams are in mid-season shape
and this contest promises to be hard
fought from start to finish, with little
advantage to either side.

Comparative scores show:

Univ. of N.C... 6 Wake Forest_-_-- oO
Univ. of N. C... 7 Univ. of S. C. ----0
Davidson...-... -27. Wake Forest._.-.- 7
Davidson.....--.. 27, Univ. of S. C.....- o

However, we would not be too quick
to jump at conclusions, as we remember
other games a little earlier in the sea-
son which ended:

Univ. of N. C....3 N.C. State........ 13
Davidson._...-_. o N.C. State.......2: 23

As these games were played in the
earlier part of the season when neither
team had reached their stride, and with
N. Shepard, Moore, Schenck and Poe
again back in the game for the Red and
Black, Davidson hopes to be able to
overcome the advantage which this com-
parison gives the North Carolina bunch.

Saturday's line-up will very likely be
sclected from the following men:

For the University of N. C.: Griffith,
Harrell, Pondexter, Jacobi, Pritchard,
Hanby, Morris, McDonald, Lowe, Ten-
ney, Spaugh, Hutchins, Kernodle, Mc-
Gee, Cochrane and Owens.

For Davidson: Hammett, LaFar,
Romefelt, Davis, Douglas, Brady, Poe,
N. Shepard, W. Shepard, Schenck, Fai-
son, McFaden, Cassell, Dant2ler, Clary,
and Carter.

The Red and Black will be backed up
by a large number of the student body
rooters who will likely find some hearty
opposition from a number of the Twin
City’s supporters of the Blue and White,
as well as Carolina students.

You all heard tel! of “Dancin’ Mose?”
No, the minstrel show hasn’t engaged
him, but “Cop” Johnson, “Johnnie” Cur-
rie and “P. D.” Mitler will be mighty
good substitutes. They sure do shake a
syncopated toe. The first call for vol-
unteers was issued in chapel last week
and 50 or more enthusiastic would-like-
to-be-black-faced-performers answered
the summons.

Professor Erwin, who is an experi-
enced director along this line, called for
a meeting of those thusly inclined for
Thursday night to discuss and go over
the general plan for the program to be
followed. The management, however,
dees not wish to make public the series
of talents as yet, so nothing but general
information was available. At any rate
a selected chorus from the Glee Club,
under the direction of Charlie Vance,
will prove to be one of the most enjoy-
able features. Houston White is also
training a violin-guitar orchestra, which
should aid greatly toward making it an
enjoyable occasion. The end men are
already working on their parts, which
will be of the highest order, both of
jokes and other minstrel stunts.

Every indication seems to point toward
a very successful show. The abundant
talent and excellent director insure that
the black-faced performance on the
night of the 29th should be the scream of
the season.

GLEE CLUB PRACTICES HARD.

The Glee Club is going strong this
year with a good line of talent to select
from. Some 50 or 60 ariswered Vance’s
call and after careful consideration,
about 30 were selected to continue work
for a few more days. The final selection
will then be made, and will include 20
or possibly 25 men.

The club is working hard in an effort
to get up their entire program before
Christmas. They are having three re-
hearsals per week and have already
learned about eight songs. It is also
planned to have plenty of instrumental
music in conjunction with the club. A
saxophone quartet has already been or-
ganized and is holding regular rehear-
sals. The first extensive trip for the
club is planned for the first of February,
and will include Winthrop, Converse,
Greenville Womans’
and Agnes Scott.

Four Touchdowns
South Carolinians

The old saying that “You can't beat
brains” was fully justified by the Wild-
cat eleven on Saturday when they pick-
ed the Gamecocks from South Carolina,
letting them down with the short end of
a 27 to o score. Again and again the ,
“Red and Black Machine” did just the
right thing at the right time and moved
steadily toward the last chalk line un-
der the South Carolinians’ goal posts.
The Davidson boys showed their versal-
ity by gaining ground either by the
acrial route, end runs, or line bucks.
Two of our touchdowns came as the re-
sult of forward passes, one from an end
run and one from an off tackle play.

Douglas, a two-letter man, ran the
team from his position at end, and him-
self carried over two touchdowns. The
first one was a pass which he caught on
D. C.’s 45-yard line and then ran the rest
of the way through a broken field with
the speed of a frightened antelope.

The interference of the Davidson men
on end runs was the prettiest that has
been seen in this part of the country for
over a decade. Every time the man
with the ball went around end he had
four or five men in front of him who
swept away all tacklers and gave the
runner a chance to pass over several
white lines. Cassell and Clary were out-
standing in this department of the game,
rarely failing to make first down when
called upon to skirt the flanks. For
line bucking and off tackle plays Mc-
Fadden is the man who pushed the
Gamecocks back.

This win on Sprunt field keeps the
Wildcat record unspotted as far as de-
feats on the home field are concerned.
The team played the best brand of foot-
ball it has put up this year and pre-
sented a driving offense and an impreg-
nable defense to their opponents. Only
once did the boys from Columbia threat-
en and that was right at the beginning
of the game.

Gressette tried a drop kick and missed
and from then on it was our game in
the Gamecocks’ territory.

Hammett, the leader of the winning
team, was the outstanding star on the
