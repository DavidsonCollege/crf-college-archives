PRETTY NEW LAMPS

Not the Champs-Elysées, but a nice walk nonetheless.

Manning
chosen as 1995
distinguished
Humanities prof

By Patricia EvANS
Staff writer

Professor Bob Manning has
already plunged into his new role

as the college’s first E. Craig Wall
Jr. Distinguished Professor of Hu-
manities.

Manning plans to emphasize
cosmology, which he defines as
“any civilization’s attempt to un-
derstand its purpose by understand-
ing nature.”

As a part of his new position,
Manning will give lectures to first
and second year humanities stu-
dents in the 1995-1996 school year
concerning groups throughout
Western Tradition that have exer-
cised cosmology in their cultures.
Manning will leave his current
department, physics, for two years
in order to devote himself totally to
the field of humanities and his stud-
ies in cosmology.

The newly endowed distin-
guished professorship was created
through the generosity of family,
friends, and admirers of E. Craig
Wall, Jr. ‘59, current Chairman of

Dr. Bob Manning.
the Board of Trustees.

Currently, Manning is in the
second year of his five-year ap-
pointment as Director of the Cen-
ter for Interdisciplinary Studies.
He will keep his post in the CIS
throughout his new distinguished
professorship and continue a 23-
year tradition of leadership and
teaching in Humanities.

Manning says, “I will miss
[physics],” but he is excited about
the opportunities that the Humani-
ties Professorship entails.

Application for
trustee comittees are
due Wednesday,
April 5. They are
available in the Dean
of Students Office.

Davidson thrives off
Duke Endowment

By RaAnpy HARTWELL
Staff writer

Davidson’s annual award from
the James B. Duke Endowment
was recently made public. This
year’s gift totals $725,000 and will
be used to help fund scholarships
and campus renovation.

A clause in the late tobacco
baron’s will stipulates the creation
of a foundation to aid four colleges
and universities in the Carolinas:
Davidson College, Duke Univer-
sity, Furman University, and
Johnson C. Smith University. Each
institution has recieved money
from that fund for the past 30 years.

The $725,000 recieved this

year will support the James B. Duke
Merit Scholars program, need-
based scholarships, and new com-
puter equipment. It will also help
pay for remaining balances due on
the Visual Arts Center, the renova-
tion of Phi and Eu Halls, and help
fund the Love of Learning pro-
gram. After Davidson representa-
tives make requests to the Duke
Endowment’s Board of Directors
for various programs in need of
funding, “every year around
Christmastime, we get a special
allocation, usually around
$700,000,” says Director of De-
velopment Kevin McCarthy.

The money Davidson gets
fluctuates depending on the stock

market, but Davidson and Furman
get about the same amount,
Johnson C. Smith gets a little less,
while Duke gets about three times
what we get, because of Mr. Duke’s
will,” he says.

‘ Once the will of James B.
Duke’s daughter Doris Duke (at
one time known as the “richest
little girl in the world”) is settled,
Davidson may stand to get even
more than the almost three-quar-
ters of a million dollars it usually
recieves from the foundation.

But the amount the college
gets now still makes a big impact.
“Davidson would be a lot different
place if it couldn’t count on that
money,” says McCarthy.

Improving Risk Management

While coping with this fiscal
challenge, the PCC is also trying to
improve risk management and
hopefully also reduce cost. Ac-
cording to Holmes, the new risk
management plan will involve
three separate features.

The first component is a po-

__lice_ officer who will be on duty

while the kegs are flowing. This is
usually from 11 p.m. until 2 a.m.
The second part is a trained,
college-age bartender. These bar-
tenders will be trained to spot stu-
dents who are dangerously drunk
and to cut them off. Bartenders

will also be on duty from 11 p.m. .

until 2 a.m.

The third aspect of risk man-
agement will be the risk manager
who will be on duty from 10 p.m.
to 3 a.m. Holmes estimates that
when all three people are working
the risk management cost is $31.50
per hour.

Insurance

No matter how successful the
new risk management program is,
Court houses still have to come to
code with their insurance policies.

INTERNATIONAL
EMPLOYMENT

Make up to $25-$45 per hour
teaching basic conversational English
abroad. Japan, Taiwan, and S.
Korea. Many empléyers provide

As the February 20 issue of The
Davidsonian reported, by having
parties open to the entire student
body, houses violate the terms of
their policies.

Thus, while the special “Court
membership” will help the PCC
raise needed funds, it will create
“closed” parties. Only indepen-
dents who pay the fee will be able
to attend, and a limited list of at-
tendees is the technical definition
of a closed party.

“The philosophy of Davidson
in general is we want to keep par-
ties open to everyone. But [the

houses] are handed downrisk man-
agement guidelines we have to fol-

low. We want to give the opportu-
nity to as many people as possible,
for a fee, to attend Court parties,”
says Shames.

Holmes concurs: “From arisk
management perspective, we can-
not have open parties and maintain
risk management policies.”

Shames recognizes that closed
parties is not the path anyone wants
to take. “I’m sorry that’s the way
it ll have to be,” he says.

Both Holmes and Shames
stated that none of the money from
independents will be used to pur-

chase alcohol. Holmes says, “The
money will go directly into an off-
campus account or a PCC account
through the school.” Since indi-
vidual houses purchase alcohol,
all funds will go to risk manage-
ment.

Shames and Holmes both ex-
pect opposition to this proposal.
Holmes says criticism will come
“from a lot of quarters.” Holmes
expects the faculty, independents,
and even Court members them-
selves to raise objections to the
plan.

But both also feel that every-
one will-warm.up.to the idea once
the formal proposal is made and
some dialogue occurs. Shames
says, “People first need to buy into
the [proposed new] system. Once
you buy into the argument, you can
accept it.” Holmes says, “People
will see the numbers ... it is not
people trying to take advantage of
another.”

Shames described the proposal

s “fair” and. the “most reason-
able” one available. And Holmes
summed up the PCC’s predica-
ment most concisely: “This is
proper risk management in a liti-
gious age.”
