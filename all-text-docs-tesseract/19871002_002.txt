CROP walk

Last Sunday 129 students and professors
joined members of the Davidson communi-
ty to participate in the CROP walk> The
route was 10 kilometers long and went
through the entire Davidson community.
Water stops were provided along the way
for thirsty participants.

The CROP disco held at PAX the night
before the walk raised $101. The total].
amount of funds raised by the walk itself
will not be tabulated until October 9,
though. According to CROP coordinator
for the YSSC, Linda Tatsapaugh ’88, “All
in all it was a good walk.”

CROP is part of the Church World Ser-
vice and initiates projects in the United
States and abroad to aid poverty-stricken
people. CROP activities, such as the CROP
walk, focus on hunger issues.
