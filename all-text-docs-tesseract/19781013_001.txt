A News Analysis

Spencer’s first decade called ‘very successful’

By CHARLES ERWIN
News Editor

When Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr. came to power ten
years ago this autumn, Davidson was a smaller and a
different college.

_In 1968, about the only women on campus were
either secretaries, cooks or made of granite.

ROTC was mandatory ‘for everyone every Tuesday
afternoon.

Students not lucky enough to fit into the mold of a
particular fraternity found themselves socially ostra-
cized.

Beer. was not allowed on campus and many of
Davidson's ‘‘old testament rules’’ were still in effect.

The library, which was located where the Union is
‘today, was inadequate and overcrowed.

No art major was offered.

If the football program did anything but suck op
funds, it certainly did not win consistently.

Professors wanting job securtiy had to become
card—carrying Christians.

There were only six black students on campus and
only a few years before some people were still smugly
predicting none would ever be enrolled here.

In 1978, it is difficult to measure just what effect
Spencer has: had on each of the changes which have
occured in thé last decade.

In some ways, things probably would have been
about the same if he had never been president of the
College. °

In other ways, things might have been better.
Or worse.

Whatever effect Spencer has had, it is clear he has

_ done what he has done because of the type of person he

is, because of the way he thinks, the way he goes about
believing in the things he believes in.

Who is this-man Spencer?

One student was overheard calling him a liar last
week.

Early this week, an deimmigbottator said deine has
more integrity that just about anybody he has ever
met.

“As I see him, one of Dr. Spencer’s strengths is that
when things go wrong he stands and takes the criticism
in good shape. But whén good things happen he is
quick to pass the credit on to other people,” said
Admissions Director H. Edmunds White.

. Because the administration
has already set November 15 as
the deadline for WDAV to play
at least 50 percent classical
music, Spencer decided several

~ weeks ago that the Executive

Meeting needed to be held in
October.

But McDowell said Wednes- .

day that only half of the
Executive members will be able
to attend. ~

She explained that she of-
fered the Trustees a whole series
of alternative dates, but that
only a few could meet at any
time other that October 16.

However, the decision made
by. the remaining five members
will still be binding under
Davidson’s Constitution, ac-
cording to McDowell.

In preparation for the meet-

trustees, and Communications

New form
of racism?

By DENNIS MCLAWHORN
News Editor

Two internationally-ac-
claimed authorities will hold a
public debate on the meaning of
the Bakke decision Monday,
October 16, at 8:00 pm in Love
Auditorium.

The debaters are Philosophy
Professor Carl Cohen of the
University of Michigan and
Jurisprudence Professor Ronald
Dworkin of University College,
Oxford University.

Cohen, a former director of
the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and a former
ACLU National Board member,
argued here last spring that
Bakke legally and morally de-
served to win his case.

Cohen has written books and
articles on civil disobedience,
democracy, medical experimen-
tation on humans, and free
speech for Nazis, among other
topics.

Dworkin has argued that
Bakke had no case, legally or
morally, and that the reasoning
of the Supreme Court: decision
on the matter is flawed.

Dworkin, the second Ameri-
can ever to chair the Jurispru-
dence | Department at Oxford, is
a visiting professor this year at
New York ruahieny ‘Law
School. ca

‘Cohen will also speak on “The
Dilemmas of Affirmative Ac-
tion” in Chambers Gallery at 10
am Monday, and he will be the
guest at an open luncheon at 1
pm in the Morrison Room: -» —
