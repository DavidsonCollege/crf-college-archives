Survey probes dating

By PEGGY NOEL
and MARIA PATTERSON
Staff Writers

An independent survey was distri-
buted to determine the amount and
type of social interaction on the
Davidson campus as reflected by
dating patterns.

The word ‘‘date’’, used in the
questionnaire, was purposely left
undefined so that so that each
respondent could use his or her own
conception of what constitutes a
satisfying social occasion.

AppFfoximately 587 students re-
ceivéd the questionnaire and an
overall return rate of 47 percent was
achieved.

Prior to distribution, the survey
was pre-tested with ten men and
women. Surveys were distributed
randomly to 73 freshman females, 102
freshman males, 60 sophomore fe-
males; 91 sophomore males, 49 junior
females; 91 junior males, 10 senior

females, and 114 senior males.
Responses to the questionnaire

were to reflect the experience of the

75-76 academic year. The percentage
of respondents who do not date is: six
percent, freshman females; 12 percent
freshman males; zero percent sopho-
more females; 19 percent, sophomore
males; 15 percent, junior females; 16
percent junior males; and 14 percent,
senior males.

Except for the sophomore and
junior females, the major percentage
of the student ‘body dates from one to
two times a month. 43 percent of the
sophomore females responding and 54
peftent of the junior females res-
ponding date more than once a week.

The large majority of females would
not like to date more than they do,
whereas a slight majority of the males
would like to date more than they do.
66 percent of the female respondents
dated less in high school than at
Davidson. __

Forty-three percent of upperclass
males dated more in high school while
81 percent of the freshman males did
so. All students were correct in
estimating the dating pattern of the

Perimeter housing facilities
ease dorm overcrowding

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

“T don’t foresee any housing
problem at all for next year,’
said Director of Student
Housing Scotty Nichols.

‘‘For the men, only eight
roommate pairs did not receive
a room in the lottery. And we
have a surplus of dormitory
rooms for the women.”

Nichols credits the favor-
able situation to an expansion
of available housing facilities
as well as an increase in the
popularity of perimeter and
off-campus living.

‘‘The enrollment will in-
crease only by 15 next year.
The College has opened two
eight-person units and the
Oak Hill Apartments are
ready for rental for the first
time. I don’t have exact
figures, but there must be 15
or 16 people planning to live
up there,” said Nichols.

“Students--especially — se-
niors--like the variety of possi-

bilities that we offer. The :
choices between on and off: :,

campus, small units.and large,
and furnished or unfurnished
afford a good balance.

‘‘Even those 16 boys who
didn’t get a room in the
drawing will certainly have a
place next year.

Everyone who has paid their

deposit is guaranteed a room,
but I figure on an attrition
rate of about 30 students
during the summer.

‘*Some of those 30 will be
involved in foreign, experi-
ential, or other off-campus
educational programs, and
some won't return to David-
son for personal or family
reasons. Several rooms will
lose one person, and each of
the 16 remaining will fill in as
those spaces become available.

The ‘luck of the draw’
caused the surplus in women’s
housing, according to Nichols.

“In the past, groups of men
have received most of the
off-campus housing. This year
several women’s groups drew
the rights to those facilities.

With a larger number of girls
living on the perimeter, there
are plenty of rooms in the
dorms,” she said.

**Mr. White in the admis-
sions office is happy to hear
that. He is anxious to get a
number of the women who
have applied as transfer stu-
dents next year, and now there
will be room for them,”’ she
concluded.

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover Meetze stressed
that ‘‘we will conduct a tho-
rough investigation of all the
housing, both on- and off-
campus, to determine what
must be done to repair, imp-
rove, and standardize the faci-
lities. Work will begin this
summer towards those ends.”
