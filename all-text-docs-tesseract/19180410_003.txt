MEETING SATC RDAV, APRIL 0.

In its rerular mecting tast. Saturday
night, the Philanthropic Society debated
the question, “Resolved, ‘Vhat Japan
should intervene in Siberia. “Phe affir-
mative was represented by Storey and F.
L.. Knight. “They advanced many argu-
ments to show that the present status ot
international affairs makes it necessary
that some nation should intervene in Si-
beria, and that Janan is the logical na-
tion to do this. ‘The negative. on the
other hand. which was represented ‘bv
Worth and Neel, contended thar such
a step was wrong in principle and not
expedient, and would not accomplish (he
end for which it was intended. Vhe
judges decided 2 to 1 in favor of the
negative.

‘Ll. H. Spence gaye some interesting
facts on Fresh History in his declama-
tion on Feudalism; while J. 1. Fuwle
proclaimed his membership in the Pln
Society by speaking on “Why [am
Proud of North Carolina.”

Even Synod did not surpass in the
efiectiveness of its oratory, or the utter
irrelevance of its logic. the debate that
was given extemporancously on the sub-
ject, “Resolved. “That Davidson should
become a co-educational instituion.”
Stogner dilated on the arguments of the
aflirmative. while AdcClure presented
the reason for the negative. The indges
decided in favor of the negative.

‘he subject for debate last Saturda:
night in the Eu Society was, “Resolved
That Japan should intervene in Si-
beria.” ‘Uhe affirmative was upheld by
Brand, Cumming and ‘Thomas, who ad
vanced the tollowing arguments: (1;
Japan is the proper nation to intervenc
(2) ut will be a great help to the cause
of the allies: (3) the Germian- are now
in charge of the toawns along the trans
Siberian railread: and (4) it is meces
cary. J. B. Woods. Frierson. L. A
Woods, dedending the negative, contend
ed: (t) Lt is impracticable: (2) Rus

sia has not asked ard: (3) it is detri-,
mental to the Cuuse of the allies; (4) it:

will confiet with Wilson's policy of non
intervention, (5) it will give Japan a
chance to “grab” part of Siberia; and
(6) there is no danger of a German in-
vasion. ‘he judges decided: in favor of

the affirmative; the house also decided in|
favor of the affirmative. The debate was!

full of pep and very interesting, as three
of the debaters were from oriental coun
tries,

After the debate Heiser and Harrell
gave declamations, Heiser gave a sclec-
tion from Webster's Bunker Hill Ora-
tion: Harrell gave a selection from Gar-
field’s Arlington Oration.

The society voted to have a service
flag with a star for cach man who has
been a member of the society for at least
six months and is now in military
service. l

There will be no regular program
next Saturday as it is the regular tine
for the election of officers. Those on
the program for next Saturday will come
off on the following Saturday night.
