Davidson Debaters

Will Meet Florida

Affirmative to Be Supported by
Smith and Stutts

The Davidson College debating team
will meet the University of Florida in
a debate in Chambers Auditorium to-
night, Wednesday, April 11, at 8:00
o'clock,

s

The query will be: “Resolved, that
the powers of the President of the
United States should be substantially
increased as a settled policy.”

Davidson will be represented by R.
H. Smith and A. C. Stutts, who will
uphold the affirmative. The names of
the University of Florida debaters are
not yet known. The presiding officer
will be G, H. Brown, Judges have not
yet been anndtinced.

Davidson has already met the Uni-
versity of Florida once this year in a
debate upon the same question, the
Davidson debaters being G. H. Brown
and Rawling Pratt-Thomas. ;This de-
bate was a non-decision debate, broad-
cast over the radio from Gainesville,
Florida, j

The subject of the debate is one of
great interest and national importance
today and is being debated not only
by colleges, but by outstanding gov-
ernmental authorities. The leaders of
our country are now faced with the
problem of making the decision as to
whether or not the President’s powers
shall be increased.

The subject involves not only that
phase of the question, but it brings
into discussion our whole theory of
national economy. It is also concerned
with whether or not we shall continue
the present policy of government or
whether we must adopt a permanent
new system of planned economy.

Brenizer Named
Handbook Mer.

New Business Manager Selected
by “Y” Cabinet

Addison Brenizer, of Charlotte, was
elected business manager of the 1934-
1935 Wildcat Handbook at a recent
meeting of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet.
Others nominated for this position were
Charles Thompson nad J. B. Goslin.
These two men and Brenizer were ap-
pointed last year by J. A. C. Wads-
worth, business manager of the 1933-
1934 Handbook, to help him with the
business management at that time.

Brenizer is a member of the Beaver
Club, Reporters’ Club, Eta Sigma Phi
classical fraternity, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon social fraternity.

This year the manager was elected
earlier than usual in order to give him
more time for his work.

WRITES REVIEW

The American Oxonian of April,
1934, carries a very interesting review
of Vera Britain’s “Testament of
Youth,” which is an Oxford book by
a woman. Quite fittingly the review
is by Elizabeth Chandler Cumming
(Mrs. W. P. Cumming), and it occupies
the place of honor among the reviews
of the April issue. It is one of the first
reviews by a woman in the American
Oxonian.

President Lingle
Outlines Building
Program For 1937

Total Amount Needed for Cen-
tennial Building Projects Is
$6,755,000

ALUMNI JOURNAL SENT

Many New Departments Will Be
Added to College

The administration and trustees of
Davidson will celebrate the centennial
of the founding of the college by be-
ginning an extensive building program
in 1937,

Dr. W. L. Lingle stated in his ex-
planatory article in the recent Alumni
Journal that “those who have wrought
in the past hundred years have given
us a wonderful foundation on which
to build. Davidson has history, tra-
ditions, and ideals that are unsur-
passed. She has a high rating in the
educational world and high spiritual
ideals. Her material equipment is very
good as far as it goes. But there are
many needs along this line.”

The following are some of the things
that could be accomplished if the col-
lege could be equipped as indicated
in this tentative program:

1. Every department of the college
could be strengthened..

2. Several new departments could
be added, such as sociology, public
speaking, music and fine arts, and so
forth.

3. The department of business and
commerce could be enlarged.

4. The best professors in the coun-
try could be obtained.

5. The college could select its stu-
dents with the greatest of care.

6. The finest type of students would
be drawn to the college.

In the report of the president of the
college to the trustees in February of
this year there is a tabulation of some
of the things that are needed for the
ideal equipment of Davidson.

Buildings:

1. A new infirmary -.---.--- $ 40,000
2. Anew. library <.2-........ 200,000

Alumni clubs throughout the eastern
and southern sections of the nation will
celebrate this event. Definite plans
for these celebrations have already
been made by twelve leading alumni

Gaston County, Greenville, S. C,

their meetings later in April. Grier
Martin, alumni secretary, has urged all
alumni to pick out the meeting near-
est them and attend it.

This first official Founders’ Day was
inaugurated in anticipation of the Cen-
tennial celebration which comes in 1937,

on Richardson Field. The games~are
Newton High School, there, today, and
Gastonia High School, there, Thurs-

Shemwell, ss; Gracey, p; Arrowood,
Corbin, and Woodward, fielders. Coach

The other men who will make the
trips are Knorr, Lanier, McKinney,
McNeil, Parker, and Sommerville.

A. B. McClure Will Succeed
Sam Wiley As “Y’’ Secretary

New Secretary Is Member of
O. D. K. and Graduate of
Union Seminary

TO BEGIN NEXT FALL

Wiley to Enter Seminary for Ad-
vanced Work

Albert B. McClure, class of '31, and
now a senior at Union Theological
Seminary, has been chosen by the Y.
M. C. A. Board of Control to succeed
Samuel S. Wiley, who will enter the
seminary next fall, as general secretary
of Y work at Davidson.

After much very deliberate consid-
eration the Board of Control, which is
an elective body in charge of the finan-
cial matters and dictation of policies to
the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet, decided to
vary from the usual plan in the selec-
tion of a secretary and choose a man,
who has been away from the college
for a while. In former years a man
from the graduating class has been
chosen for this office, because such a
person would have a more intimate
contact with the students. The board,
however, states that they believe in
the case of McClure his qualifications
for the position and acceptability by
the students will be enhanced by his
seminary training.

McClure, better known to his David-
son friends as “Parson,” was quite
popular on thé campus while a student
here, having been a member of O.
D. K., honorary leadership organiza-
tion, a member of the Y. M. C. A.
Cabinet, vice-president of the Senior
class, and active in many other phases
of college life.

He was student pastor of the David-
son Unity Church for two years, dur-
ing which time he won a very warm
place in the hearts of those people in
the Mill Village to whom he minis-
tered. jn view of the untiriag-ettorty
of “Parson” in this capacity, he was~
selected by the faculty to receive the
Algernon Sidney Sullivan medallion.
This is an award given at.commence-
ment every year to one member of
the graduating class and one outsider
as a recognition of their unselfish serv-
ice to mankind, The work of the new-
ly-elected Y secretary at the Davidson
Chapel was very distinctly character-
ized by service for others,

During his three years at Union
Seminary he has won for himself sev-
eral other very distinct honors. He
was chosen president of his class for
the middle year, and this year he was
said to have preached the best senior
sermon ever delivered at that institu-
tion. He has served as assistant pastor
of the Presbyterian Church at Peters-
burg, Va., for a part of this time and is
now temporary pastor of the Presby-
terian Church at Rapidan, Va.

His home is in Rabun Gap, Ga,
where he received his early training®
at Nacootchie School.

Sam Wiley, who has served as “Y”
secretary for the past two years, will
begin training this fall for the min-
istry at Union Theological Seminary
in Richmond, Va. Sam has handled the
work during these two years in a very
able fashion, and his presence will be
missed on the campus, but we wish
for him good success in his life work.

McClure will assume his duties some
time during the summer.

Carlson Will Head
Rising Soph Class

New President to Conduct Re-
maining Elections

In the freshman elections held last
Friday and Saturday, April 6 and 7,
Carl Carlson was elected president of
the rising Sophomore class for the
coming year.

In the nominations, which were held
on Thursday, ten men were nominated
as follows: Jack Branch, C. I. Carl-
son, H. P, Clark, T. G. Corbin, W. S.
Edwards, R. S. Johnson, C. W. Mauze,
W. B. Munson, Maurice Peabody, and
R. B. Stewart.

The final ballot-on Saturday con-
tained the names’ of Carlson, Corbin
and Stewart.

Nominations for secretary and treas-
urer were held yesterday by Carlson,
and voting will take place today and
tomorrow.
