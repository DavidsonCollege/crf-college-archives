President Of Louisville Seminary
Speaks On “‘The Glory Of
The Cross”

“Glory of the Cross” was the subject
chosen by Dr. J. R. Cunningham, presi-
dent of Louisville Theological Seminary,
Louisville, Ky., for his vesper’s talk last
Sunday evening.

“The Glory of the Cross stands out
as Lent approaches,” began Dr. Cun-
ningham. He chose as his text, Gala-
tians 6:14.

Three symbolic words are associated
with the crucifixion of Christ: ‘blood,
Calvary, and cross. Blood is the precious
fluid which Jesus shed while He hung
suspended on the cross.

We Christians of today associate two

Local Literary Society Entertains
Score Of Girls

The Eumenean Literary Society's red
tetter day of the year was celebrated
last Tuesday, March 19, when a dele-
gation from the Queens-Chicora society
had charge of the program. ;

The comely delegation, about 25
strong, arrived just in time to interrupt
a solo by Ex-Secretary Joe Dees. The
president of the visiting society took the
president’s chair during the program.

The presentation of the Queens so-
ciety was varied in nature and was ac-
corded much applause. First on the pro-
gram was an imaginative original short
story.of the Orient.

Following this were a group of son-
nets, ranging from the pensive to the
amorous, written by a member of the
séciety. The high spot of the program
came next when the visiting girls pre-
sented an unusual one-act
French actress and her lover's disillu-
sioned wife.

The meeting was then adjourned to
the Phi Delt house where the trio ren-
dered several selections. Informal en-
tertainment and refreshments followed.

The Queens Society, numbering about
100 girls, is divided into four branches,
the president explained. ‘Fhey are: dra-
matic, literary, musical and poetic. Each
group has about 25 girls.

The local society, headed by Clarence
White, James Salango, and Jim Mor-
ton, plans to give a return program on

Choosing as his subject, “Glass, An
Indispensable Substance in Modern Civil-
ization,” Dr, Silverman explained with
illustrations the mattfacture of glass
and exhibited experiments showing the
remarkable changes in, color which the
introduction of any foreign element will
produce in it.

An example of this latter effect was
found in a sheet of plate glass which
on one side acts as a mirror while ap-
pearing transparent to an observer on
the other side. Of this, Dr. Silverman
predicts, will be made the office doors
of the future.

He also showed an aluminum-backed
mirror. ‘This recently discovered type
surpasses all previously in use and in-
volves an entirely new process in mirror
