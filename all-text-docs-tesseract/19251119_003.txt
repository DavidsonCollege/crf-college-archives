THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 19, 1925

Oh well, there is so much to be said
about that game last Saturday that it
is almost useless to continue lauding the
merits of the Davidson team. Davidson
gained more ground against Carolina in
that game than against any team that the
Wildcats have played this season— with-
out a single exception. How does that

sound for a team that is considered the.

best and strongest team in the state?
Carolina declared state champions
upon the basis of scores, but upon the
basis of actual playing and ground
gained the Wildcats get the honors.

Wifey—"Didn't I hear the clock strike
two as you came in last night?”

Hubby (a quick thinker)—‘*You did,
my dear. It started to strike eleven and
I stopped it so that it wouldn't wake you
up.
