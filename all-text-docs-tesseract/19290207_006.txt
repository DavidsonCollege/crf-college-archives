Anthology of Verse

Sigma Upsilon Hopes to Complete
a Collection Made by Two
Former Members

If certain plans of the Sigma Upsilon
literary fraternity are carried through,
though they are held only tentatively
now, there will soon be placed on sale
the first volume of Anthology of
Davidson Poetry. Finances are holding
up the publication at present; but if suf-
ficient interest is shown by students and
the general public, the book will he pub-
lished shortly.

A first compilation of verses thought to
be of sufficient literary merit to be wor-
thy of publication, was made by P. F.
Jones and H. L. Shelby, both of the class
of 1927. The poetry was chosen from
among that printed in the Davidson Col-
lege Magazine; and magazines covering
a period of about forty years were read
with the purpose of a selection of verses
from their contents. Jones and Shelby
made no attempt to have the poetry which
they collected published, but were content
to have them read in meetings of Sigma
Upsilon.

The present chapter of Sigma Upsilon
hopes, however, to make the anthology
up to date, selecting such poems from the
Chameleons of the past. twa yej
worthy of publication. Its ynated
that there will be in all, some U¥rdred o1
more poems chosen from students’ writ-
ings, from forty years ago to the present
time. No definite statement can be made
at this time as to the probabie date ol
publication, due to the uncertamity of
financial backing.

as seen

Jones and “Shelby, the fathers of the
idea, were both very active along literary
lines while at Davidson. Jones was a
staff member of the Davidsonian, and was
the regular critic of the Magazine, at
which he gained no little reputation here
on the campus. Shelby was the last edi-
tor of the Peanut Parcher, the humorous
section of the tany
years. At his departure, since no one
found who could compare favorably with
hi min ability the department was drop-
ped from the columns of this sheet.

Work from the pens two the
present members. of the college faculty
is said to be in the present cosy of the
Anthology which is yet in manuscript
form. The above mentioned authors are

Politics As Career
For the Collegian

“Politics never used to be considera
a gentleman's game,” says Leo. A. Borah,
“College folk looked down on the whole
business with disdain. They wouldn't
give it a minute’s consideration. But the
attitude of the college student is chang-
ing today; he recognizes politics as a
real force in the country. If the students
who really feel an active interest in gov-
ernment will consider politics as a career
and énroll in the courses intended io pre-
pare them for it, the United States will
be able to mix in world politics without
fear. It will no longer be the tenderfoot
sitting in the other fellow’s game.

“The student who would go in for poli-
tics needs to obtain first a thorough
cultural education. At the same time
he must learn how to put his knowledge
to work, how to get out of the academic
rut and talk in the language of the elec-
torate. A charlatan with a full comple-
ment of campaign tricks can beat the
most brilliant theorist in the world if the
theoorist does not know how to put his
stuff over.

“The trouble with most American col-
lege students today is that they know
nothing about public affairs. In an ex-
amination in current events in a certain
university, one student identified George
Washington English as a famous negro
ediicator. Another thought Maxfield
Parrish was the headquarters of the Ku
Klux Klan. With that sert. of knowledge
how can college students expect to do
anything at politics? Fortunately not all
students are like that. With the com-
ing of professors of practical politics
has come a growing interest of students
in the business of government.

“Politics is not a crowded profession.
It gives you a chance to use your per-
sonality and your education and at the
same time to be a regular human being.’

Ann Arbor, Michigan—(CNA)—The

for three years president of the Univer-

Paul Heuze, writing for Le Journal
recently made a few experiments to
expose some of the tricks of the Hindu
fakirs. He had himself lowered in a
coffin into a lake and found that by
remaining motionless he could stay in
the coffin 65 to 85 minutes without
suffering much discomfort. One of
the Hindu fakir’s favorite tricks is to
permit himself to be buried alive in a
coffin, and then after an hour or so
an accomplice secretly digs him out.
After a few days or weeks he is secret-
ly buried again, and within an hour he
is publicly dug up.

The Boulder Dam bill was passed by
Congress and signed by the president
last month, but before it can be carried
out six of the seven states concerned
must ratify the Colorado River com-
pact which apportions their respective
rights to water from the Colorado.
Five of the states have approved, but
of the remaining two, Arizona is defi-
nitely opposed and the other state is
doubtful.

resignation woud be unanimous.

Dr. Little’s reasons for resigning are
follows as contained in his letter:
“Dear Regent: For some time two
things have been increasingly apparent.
First, that my methods of handling sit-
uations dealing with interests of private
donors, political interests, ‘local’ inter-
ests and alumni interests, are not con-
sistent with policies which the board of
regents deems wise. Second, that I shall,
I hope be more effective in scientific re-
search and teaching than in adminis-
tration.”
