CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

ms,

Two, years ago this fall the Wild-
cats paid their last visit to the
campus of fair Duke, and at that
time the Red and Black was rid-
ing the crest of a victory wave.
Fresh from a 10 to 0 defeat of
U.N. C., the Cats were in line for
the state title and they didn’t
lose much time in putting the skids
on Jimmy Dehart’s men—20 to 0
was the count. This year it is dif-
ferent. Davidson has experienced
a disastrous season, and only the
“superb fighting of the Wildcat
team has given hope to its support-
And that spirit is Davidson’s
hope in Thursday’s game.

ers.

There is no question as to the act-
ual strength of the two elevens.
Duke is admittedly the superior in
manpower. We do not believe, how-
ever, that Duke's reserves’ will cause
as much trouble as did Carolina's.
The teams will be a little more even
in that respect. But that old Wild-
main forte of the Blue Devil camp,
cat poison, a passing attack, is the
titude in breaking up and intercept-
and unless the Cats show new ap-
ing these winged messengers of dis-
aster, the game is likely to be disap-
pointing. We are not worried about
Duke's running attack—any team
that can hold Carolina in check as
the Cats did should be able to stop
the “Devils.

If those passes can be controll-
ed, the Wildcats are in good shape
to WIN Thursday, because any
time seven or eight men take the
field for the last time in their ca-
reers there is going to be a scrap.
It is our opinion that Sam Buie
and Jan Janoskie will need all the
tricks in their bag before that
game is over. When a Davidson
team goes out to fight, anything
can happen.

With the season of all-state
teams in the offing, we are won-
dering whether or not Davidson is
going to step in for one or two
places on the mythical eleven. Cer-
tainly the bad record of the team
as a whole is going to hurt any-
body’s chance of placing. We are
sure though, that at least three
Wildcats are going to get serious
consideration. Brock, Kell, and
Riggs McConnell have shown
themselves to be as good as the
best, and we don’t see how they

can be overlooked.

These facts, taken with the records of

another Duke victory, it seems.

Duke is the only undefeated or un-

in season they handed Wake Forest a
good drubbing and last week nosed
out the strong State bunch 14 to 12.
The only foes left are Davidson and

Sophomores.

State only won by
one touchdown and Carolina came very
near not winning at all. This is en-
couraging to say the least and, with
every man on the squad ready for
action, it is obvious that there will be
a real fight. Injuries have played a
large part in Davidson's defeats so far
this season, but there are none now to
prevent the team of the year
starting against Duke. With Fraley,
Kell, Black and Flinn in the backfield,
the 'Cats will have one that witl come
very near proving a match for the

Wildkittens Threaten Often But
Fail to Register

Coach Buck Miles’ Wildkittens were |

repulsed from the frigid lair of the
Asheville High gridders last Friday
with no blood having been drawn. Al-
though the hard plunging frosh were
threatening to register throughout the
fracus, the contest ended in a nothing
to nothing deadlock,

At the beginning of the game, things
looked for the Kitten eleven.
Captain Goodson received the open-
ing kick-off on his own fifteen yard
line and ran the ball back for \fifty-
five yards before he finally
downed on Asheville’s thirty-five yard
stripe. A first down was quickly reeled
off and the oval placed within thirteen
yards of a touchdown. Here the Ashe-
ville forward wall rallied to arrest the

incomplete over the goal line, and the
ball exchanged hands. Asheville kick-
ed well out of danger, but again Good-

son careened his way back to the
Asheville twenty-seven yard = mark.
Again the Maroons arose to defend

their goal, and no score resulted for
the Kittens. Twice more during the
tilt, Davidson was well within scoring
territory, but on both occasions, failed
to register.

In thé latter portion of the game,
Asheville opened an offensive of their
own, Their fleet backs, led by the re-
doubtable Chakles repeatedly ripped
the Kitten line for good gains. On‘one
occasion, they advanced the ball to the
Freshmen’s thirty-seven yard line, but
failed to gain further.

Dick and J. T, Bradshaw played their
usual stellar brand of football in the
halfback positions of the Wildkittens,
while Captain Godoson provided the
fans many thrills with his long, spec-
tacular runs. In the Davidson line,
Scales at tackle proved a bulwark on
the defense. Chakles, the quarterback
of the Maroon eleven, and Washing-
ton at half, were the bright lights for
