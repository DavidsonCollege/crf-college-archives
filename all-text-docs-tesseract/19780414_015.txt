Basketball recruiting

(Gregg Strader)

Wildcats land four

By JOHN WILLINGHAM
Asst. Sports Editor

Four high school seniors loa-
ded with impressive credentials
have thus far announced their
intention to play basketball for
Davidson next year. Though
handicapped by a late start,
Coach Eddie Biedenbach has
apparently overcome the obsta-
cle and landed four players who
will not only provide the height
absent from recent squads, but
will also add strength to all
areas of the team.

Two of the recruits, Jamie
Hall and Eric Sorenson, are
from the Pittsburgh area, while
Greg Berlacher and Brian
Rowan hail from Toledo, Ohio.

Hall a 6’9” center from Penn
Hills High School, averaged 21
points, 15 rebounds, and seven
blocked shots a game ¢his past
season. A first team all-state
selection, Hall played for the
Pennsylvania All-Stars in the
Dapper Dan Roundball Clasic
two weeks ago and participated
in the All-America games at
Sharon, Penn.

“A big man like Jamie will
help put the pieces together for
us,’’Biedenbach remarked, add-

_ing that Hall “should compli-
ment our existing players well.”

Hall had been contacted by
more than 200 colleges, but nar-
rowed the choices to Davidson,
Michigan, and Virginia before
making his decision.

Assistant Coach Tom Abate-
marco, who was at Iona last
year, aided in the recruting of
Jeff Ruland, who was named
All-American as a freshman at
Iona this year.

“Jeff is a great player for
Iona, but.I feel Jamie has better
natural talent. He is a better
jumper, has more quickness,
and is a better shot blocker.”’

Sorenson, a 65%” forward
from Peters Township High
School, announced his inten-
tions on Tuesday of this week.
The McMurray, Pa. native av-
eraged 18.2 ppg as a senior and
received numerous honors as

well.
He was named to the AAA

All-Section Nine Team and
played on the same Pennsylva-
nia squad as did Hall in the
Dapper Dan Classic.

The two Ohians have not
officially signed yet, but are
expected to do so by the end of
the: week.

Berlacher, a 6’4’’ forward
from St. John’s High School, is
considered to be among the top

20 players in the state. As a
senior, he averaged 16.5 ppg
and led his team in steals during
the season.

He has also been honored
numerous times, having been
chosen for the all-city team for
the past two years as well as
having been selected to the
all-district squad this year.

Rowen attended St. Francis
High School, a _ rival of
Berlacher’s school, and was
highly recruited as well. This
past season he averaged 16.5
ppg, 12 rebounds, and shot a
superior 57 percent from the
field. Rowen is also considered
to be among the elite cagers in
Ohio.

Biedenbach, who watched
Davidson play in the Southern
Conference Tournament, knows
the tough job that he faces
in the upcoming season. He is
confident, however, that there
will be a definite improvement
in the play of the Wildcats next
year.

“T can’t predict how many
wins and losses we will have
next year. But I do think these
additions will make us better
and a more exciting team to
watch.”

Cumberland College won the
19th Annual Davidson Relays,
held April 8th on the Whittle

- ‘Track, edging runner-up Appa-

lachian State, 97-94. Twenty-
five teams comprised what was
certainly the finest field ever
assembled here, as new records
were established in 11 of the 20
events. :

Davidson's Jarry ‘Doren:
Taylor was responsible for one
of the marks as he won the
hammer throw at 150’2'%’’.The
defending champion for the last —
two years, Taylor bettered the
competition by almost 12 feet
and set a new school record on
the process.

Junior Doug Horn, impro-
ving his best time of the season
by almost half a minute, placed
fourth in the steeple chase with
a 9:39.6.

Undoubtedly the most dra-
matic moment for Wildcat fans
was the 10,000 meters, which
pitted senior Coty Pinckney
against Wake Forest’s Jack
Durkin. In the hot, grueling
25-lap race Pinckney & Durkin
were together virtually the en-
tire distance, and after two
miles the two runners were all
alone. On the gun lap, with the
shorter Pinckney ahead by a
stride, Durkin surged but was
held’ off on the back stretch,
Coming off the curve, dead even
with his opponent, Pinckney

suddenly shifted gears and be-

gan a devasting 80-yard sprint.
He-won by 15 yards, arms
raised in triumph.

The Wildcats finished 10th
overall with 24 points. The
Women's team fared somewhat
better, placing 4th with 37
points: Seven _ individuals
placed for the Wildcats. Burk-
ley Mann and Debbie Carlton
were 2nd and 5th respectively,
