Among French Troops.

Dr. T. W. Lingle announced last
week that he had decided to enter the
Y. M. C. A. work among the French
forces. He has left his home in Mon-
treat for New York, on his way to
France.

His decision coming at such a time
necessitates many changes, and for this
reason it is impossible to publish the
schedule of recitations in this issue as
the management had hoped to do. At
a meeting of the executive committee of
Davidson College on the 27th of this
month it was decided to request Dr. C.
R. Harding to teach the German. Prof.
Macon Reed will therefore have charge
of Greek I, IT and ITI, if the present
plans turn out as expected. This will
not result in any loss of efficiency, but
many changes will have to be made in
the schedule before it-can be announced.

Dr. Lingle is well qualified for his
work abroad. He has traveled exten-
sively in several of the foreign countries,
including France and Germany. He
received the degree of Ph.D. from the
University of Leipsic. He speaks both
French and German fluently and under-
stands the characteristics of the French
people. We regret very much to lose
Dr. Lingle from the faculty, but wish
him much success in his newly-chosen
field of endeavor. His address will be
Avenue Montaigne 31,. Paris, France.

Mrs. Lingle has also offered her
services and been accepted. She will
either accompany Dr. Lingle or follow
him in the near future.

MISS MAY WILLIAMS.

Miss May W lliams, for some time a
dean of one ce the hospitals in Char-
lotte, die? ~°'.' | 27th of August in
Davidson, ‘St ye a member of one
of the oldesy ,". gnost respected families
of Davidson, "’

This Week.

Mr. L: S. Bradshaw will complete
his portion of the work by the first of
September. ‘Nhe Gym will measure up
to the full expectation of the old men
and will be a delight to both them
and the new men.

The main floor, which is of maple
scraped to a smooth surface, is large
enough to accommodate two basket ball
games at the same time. A wide hal-
cony extends around three sides of the
Gym, furnishing ample room for the
spectators.

On'the main floor with the Gym are]:

four rooms, which will be used as aux-
iliary gymnasium, director's office, and

physical examination rooms. On_ the
top floor there is a large room for class
room or instruction purposes and two
dormitory rooms for the use of the ath-
letic director.

In the basement. one finds a kitchen-
ette, a store room, a janitor’s room, a
room for the visiting team and faculty,
a Varsity team room, a rubbing

room,
a general shower room, a room fo .|C

ing uniforms and a boiler room.

The building is of the colonial type
and is built of red brick. The equip-
ment is to be modern and up-to-date in
every detail.

You ape-tither returning or coming
for the first time\to Davidson College

under very unusual conditions prevail-
ing in our cowttty and the world at
large.

In the name of the, college I give you
all a most cordial welcome.

College will moye on much as usual,
but with, | hope, a much more serious
undercurrent of devotion to duty on
the part of all connected with the insti-
tution.

Educated men will be at a premium
during the next generation. Grave re-
sponsibilities will rest upon them. The
times call for every man who has the op-
portunity to get an education to seriously
pursue the courses involved in his intel-
lectual training and prepare for the hard.
work of the future.

Splendid physical manhood is called
for. Every one should go into “train-
ing’’ of some proper sort.

Moral and spiritual fibre of the finest
sort must be woven thru and thru the
life ot these future leaders if “Dem-
ocracy is to he made safe for the
world.” .

Davidson offers you the best, it is for
vou to take advantage of it from the
start. Let’s train ourselves to meet every
duty and every responsibility in class
room and on campus in the light of these
things and “quit ourselves like men.”

Captain Lea, of Timmonsville, S. C.,
graduate of the Citadel, in Charleston,
S. C., is to be in charge of the gymnas-
ium and military training. Drill will
be required of Freshmen and Sopho-
mores unless parents object, in which
case equivalent gymnasium work will be
substituted.

Captain Lea was captain of the cadets
at the Citadel and comes highly recom-
mended.
