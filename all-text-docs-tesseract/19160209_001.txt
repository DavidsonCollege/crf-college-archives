Plans Made for a Town Y. M.C. A.
---Banquet Enjoyed.

On Thursday evening at 8 o'clock the
laymen of the local Presbyterian church
held their annual meeting In the Civic
League hall. A committee of ladies of
the church, composed of Mesdames
Brady, Shelton, Arbuckle, H. J. Brown,
J. M. McConnell, Cranford, and Miss
Minnie Scofield. had prepared a banquet
for the occasion and a most enjoyable
evening was spent by the seventy-five
men who attended.

During the evening topics of town im-
provement were discussed and plans
made. Dr. C. R. Harding acted as
toast master, and the speeches of the
occasion were made by Rev. Bolling
Hobson, of Cornelius; Professor Currie,
Drs. Arbuckle. J. M. McConnell, C.
M. Richards. and Messrs. F. L. Jack-
son and C. L. Grey.

Plans for a town Y. M. C. A. were
discussed and a committee appointed to
work on the plan and to ask for the co-
operation of the other denominations of
the town.

The officers elceted for the coming
year are: C. L. Grey, president; Avery
Hobbs, vice-president; W. H. Thomp-
son, treasurer; James Blue, secretary.

W. G. SOMERVILLE
LEAVES COLLEGE

It was with great regret that lasi
week the Y. M. C. A. cabinet received
the resignation of the president, W. G.
Somerville, who was leaving college t
accept, a position as Assistant National
Bank Examiner in the district of Vir-
ginia and West Virginia.

Somerville entered the Sophomore
class in Davidson in the fall of 1913,
and rapidly won his way into the hearts
of the entire student body by his friendly
spirit and ready helpfulness. He has
entered into practically every student
activity and has stood high in his classes
throughout his entire course. He has
always stood for the very best in college
life.

The Y. M. C. A., which has been
built up year by year, has probably pass-
ed the best year of its history under his
administration. Two important things
stand out in this work—the Chapman-
Alexander meetings and the completion
of the Social Center, which has proven
so popular this year. Other things. less
outstanding, but. just as important, have
entered into this work,

It has been with universal regret that
everyone has learned that Somerville has
found it best .to leave at this time.

MISSION STUDY CLASSES
BEGIN SPRING WORK

The enrollment of this year’s Mission
Study classes is 115. It is thought oth-
ers will be added to this number, as sev-
eral were not seen by those canvassing.
These Mission Study classes will take
the place of last fall's Bible Study
classes. Last year the study of missions
proved to be very interesting. and it is
heved that a large number of_ students
will be enrolled within the next: few
weeks.

Exercises Begin on the Afternoon

Two More Victories
For Red and Black

Charlotte ¥. M. C. A. and Guilford
Fall Before Locals’ Attack.

CHARLOTTE GAME.

“Who will make it fifty?” yelled an
enthusiastic fan. as the Davidson quint
rushed the ball down the goal for the
48th point over the Charlotte Y. M,C.
A. But the 50th point was not forth-
coming, and the game ended 49 to 37,
with Davidsen maintaining a strangle-
hold on the long end. ‘The game was
very fast and interesting, and perhaps
the most exciting seen on the Davidson
court this year.

The first half was rather slow, with
Charlotte casily holding the advantage
uatil the last few minutes, when David-
son took a new grip and pulled the score
up to 20-18, D. C's favor.

The second half opened with a rush
which did not cease until the last whistle
blew. ‘The lead see-sawed from one side
to the other for about five nunutes,
when, with a rash like a ternado, the
Davidson rally arrived. Eleven points
were rolled up in about four minutes,
hefore Charlotte could catch hes breath.
In vain the Queen City lads made shifts
in their line up in attempts to stem the
tide, but the tide would not be stemmed.
‘Time was-called out for a moment, and
the Davidson pep was lost. but the
whirhwind floor work of both teams cor-
tinned, with Charlotte gaining a slight
advantage.

Davenport and Howell were the lead-
ings lights for the visitors, with Croak
plaving a splendid defensive game. In-
deed, it) was the air-tight guarding of
Crook and Ross that held the Davidson
team in check during the first half.

King. forward, who seemed to be on
the ball wherever it landed, and who
fought for every inch of ground, was the
star for Davidson. Hengeveld furnish-
ed some of the prettiest scoring work

seen this season, and repeatedly made
seemingly impossible goals. © Walker
plaved the best defensive game of the
locals. The line-up:

Davidson, Position. Char. ¥Y MCA
King.......... Forward . 2... Marsh
Childs......... Forward . . Davenport
Hengeveld......Centre ... . . Howell
Reese (c)...... Guard... . Crook (c)
Younger....... Guard ......., Ross

Substitutions--Walker for Younger
for Childs, Wood for Younger.

Field Goals—Davenport 7, King 3.
Reece 5, Hengeveld 8, Howell 4, Marsh
2, Crank 2, Wood 2, Childs, Younger.
Foul Goals—Craok 5, King 3, Reese 2.

Referee: Booe.

GUILFORD GAME,

The second game of the week also re-
sulted in a victory for Davidson, Guil-
fard being taken inta camp to the tune
of 45 to 18.) The Guilfordians seemed
hewildered by the intricate passes and
plays unwound by the locals, and could
not stem the torrent of Davidson points
that poured through the basket at all
times. T. Seamans, guard, plaved a very
nluckv game and deserves especial credit.
For Davidson, King. Hengeveld and
Reese shared honors. The line-up:

Position, Guilford.
