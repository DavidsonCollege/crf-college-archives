Varsity Sport

By JOHN MOORE
Sports Writer —

The faculty Athletic Com-
mittee Thursday granted sta-
tus as a varsity sport to the
Davidson sailing. team.

After two and a half years
of formal competition in the
S-uth Atlantic Intercollegiate
Sailing -Association (SAISA),
the team will obtain approv-
ed collegiate recognition next

fal..
In the past the idea of var-

sity status had remained at
the talking stage only .but
team captain Tom Kitrley
working with the coach,
French Professor Hallam
Walker, drew up a formal
petition to present to the fae-
ulty committee.

The petition had originat-
ed as a motion in the Fresh-
man Council, but in the last
several weeks the SGA Sen-
ate and the D Club endorsed
it.

Phoenix, Jersey Squads
Pick Knowles In Draft

It appears that Rodney
Knowles will ‘play profes-
sional basketball next year

. somewhere.

The 6-9 senior from Green-
ville has had several offers
from professional clubs and
is currently trying to decide
which one it will be.

Knowles was drafted early
this week by New Jersey of
the American Basketball As-
sociation, and then he was
chosen in the sixth round of
the NBA draft by the newly
formed Phoenix club.

Knowles is traveling to
New Jersey this week to dis-
cuss contract negotiations,
but has other offers to con-
sider beside the American
clubs.

Several European teams
have made offers to Knowles,
including Antwerp and two
Italian clubs.

Knowles indicated that he
would have some ‘decision

up by the Arizona club in the
NBA's expansion draft this
week.

The New Jersey club also
picked up Eddie Biedenbach.
the All-American guard from
North Carolina State and a
close friend of Knowles.

Although Brown has filled
the gap well, the team is not
as effective as the Shaw.
Bailey combination was: Jast
year. Shaw will probably re-
turn to play next. week.

Brown and Bailey had ear
lier defeated the Delt team
of John Passmore and Jan
Postma, the Pika team of
Fred Lowrance and Frank
Spence, and Gary Peklo and
Doug Rhymes of.the Phi
Gamms.

The independents lost two
heartbreakers this week. both
coming in the final game of
the third set. Ewart and
Thebeau defeated. them, and
after an upset victory over
the SAE's, the Indies fell
again to the Nus.

The Pikas played the
Gamms and the ATO’s took
on the Nus today in the quar-
terfinals of the losers brack-
et. The winners of those
games will play Monday to
determine who fill face the
Kappa Sigs in the losers
bracket finals Tuesday.

The sailing team has been
the only team on campus.
without varsity status, but
with faculty approval, all
teams are now represented.

In its two and a half years
in SAISA, the sailors have
been runners-up in the fall
competition several times,
and have been invited to
compete in two intersection
al regattas.

In 1967 the team had 4 full
schedule of ‘14 meets and
was runner-up in the fall
championship.

Bob Murphy, ‘67, served as
president of SAISA last year.
and this year sophomore
James Lee is vice-president
and John Moore is on the
Executive committee. ;

Besides Davidson, Clem-
son, Duke, Old Dominion.

College of Charleston, The ~

Citadel, William and Mary
and the University of South
Carolina are members. of

The ‘Cat fuzzballers re-
turned home from Lexington.

fourth consecutive confer-
ence title.

This week's tournament

was hotly contested. with the.

Wildcats edging The Citadel
and George Washington. the

second place finishers, by a.

single point, 17-15.

Davidson Coach Harry Fo
gleman was extremely pleas ,
ed with the team’s Showing
in Lexington, especially in
light of the tough competi-
tion they faced.

“Tennis in the Southern
Conference has improved 100
per cent in the last two
years,”” he said.

“When I first came to Da-
vidson, George Washington
and The Citadel were the
only good teams in the con-
ference,’ he added. ‘This
year there were five very
good teams at the tourna-
ment beating each other's
brains out.”

George Berner defeated
Tee Hooper of The Citadel
for the conference champion-
ship in the number one sin
gles competition in what Fo-
gleman described as ‘one of
the best college matches I
have ever seen.”

Team captain Sam Hatch.
er received a4 poor draw .in
the second division singles
pairings and lost in the semi-
finals to Randy Heffron of
The Citadel, who went on to
capture the division title.

Dan Hearon took second

place in the number three
division, going all the way to

James Cantrell was also
impressive for the Wildcats.
Cantrell lived. up to his num-
ber..one seeding in the fifth
division. winning every
match in straight sets to
take the singles litle.

David Jennings won his
first match in the number
six singles but lost to the
eventual divisional champ ‘in
the semifinals.

The Wildeats had trouble
in the doubles competition.
failing to win any of the
three divisional titles  al-

the divisions. -

The final match of the
tournament, the number

GW and The Citadel proved

to be the decisive one of the.

entire tournament. George
Washington won it to tie for
second place. ;

The match would have giv

Wildcats if they had won, but

exciting match in three sets.

Golfers’

Charge

Bypasses ECU

With a solid, come-from-
behind effort. the Davidson
golf team rallied Wednesday
to secure its third consecu-

tive Southern Conference
championship.
.The linkmen — scrambled

from eight strokes beliind to
grab the trophy at the tour
nament, held Tuesday and
Wednesday at the Dunes Golf
and Beach Club, in Myrtle
Beach.

Davidson, whose top four
players totaled 633 for 36
holes, had been in fourth
place after completion of
Tuesday's first round.

Senior George Leight led
the Wildcat charge in the
final round as he shot a two-
over par 74 for a two-round
total of 154. His score was
good enough to gain second
place’ individually.

Individual honors for the
tournament went to The Cit-
adel‘s David Joseberry, who
fired a.151 for the two days,
with rounds of 76-75.

The score is based on the
top four golfers from each
school. Davidson sent six
men, and counted the scores
of Leight, John Giles, Cary
Hite, and Tucker Dalton.

Hite finished two strokes
behind Leight. 80-76. 156.
Giles finished with an 83-77,
160, ‘while Dalton finished
83-80, 163. All three played
the best golf they have play-
ed all year over the beach
course. .

The tourney was nothing
but. disappointment for Da‘
vidson's number one player,
Mike Spann. He led Davidson
with a 78 at the end of the
first round, but found numer:
ous problems on the front
nine. during the second round
and could manage but an 86

dividual medalist in last
year’s tournament.

ence championship for Da-
vidson, the fifth under Coach
Tom Scott. Scott said that
he was. ‘well pleased with
the whole tournament.’
