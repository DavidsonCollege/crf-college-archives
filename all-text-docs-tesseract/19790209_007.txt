Parkerson challenges Academy,
Proposes project on cigarettes

By JEAN SORACCO
Asst. Features Editor

John Parkerson, a senior
biology major at Davidson,
recently challenged a roomful of
pipe and cigarette-smoking
scientists: “If any of you as
rational scientists can: sit there
and tell me that smoking is
healthy, please tell me—I’m all
ears.”’

Parkerson said that in reac-
tion to his challenge, ‘Every
face dropped; every cigarette
went out. They all looked at me
like, ‘Who are you?’”

Parkerson, the president of
the Collegiate Academy of the
North Carolina Academy of
Science (NCAS) addressed the
NCAS board of directors on
Jan. 27. At this meeting he
asked that the Academy con-
cern themselves with the issue
of tobacco use in North Caro-
lina.

His proposal -asks that the
Academy: 1) affirm the Surgeon
General's Report, 2) educate the
people of the state concerning
the hazards of smoking and 3)
search for economic alternatives
to tobacco.

According to Parkerson, this -

would be an ideal project by
which NCAS, an organization
of high school, college, and
professional scientists, can fur-
ther its goal of interpreting
scientific issues for the benefit
of lay people in the state. His

(Parks Snead)

concern is shared; the Charlotte
Observer, Parkerson says,
plans to run a series on smoking
during the month of March.

Further action will be taken
at the next meeting of NCAS on
March 30, when Parkerson will
resubmit his proposal as a more
formal resolution.

Despite the possible impact
of his project, Parkerson says
that the Academy’s interest in
public affairs is secondary to its
main function—that of a forum
for presentation of research in
various scientific areas.

At the March meeting, high
school, college and professional
scientists will read their re-
search papers. Carlton Jenkins,
another senior biology major,
will present his paper entitled
‘Gross and Functional Morpho-
logy of the Heart of Amphiuma
means” (the salamander).

Last year, four or five papers
were presented by Davidson
students but, according to
Parkerson, not much research
has been done here this year.

Several other, Davidson stu- ;

dents are closely involved with
the Academy. Senior Beth Du-
Bose is the historian and senior
Fred Weber is the vice-presi-
dent. They are affiliated by way
of the Biology Department, the
only science department at
Davidson which belongs to the
Academy.

‘mented Smith,

Smith “fast catching on” after 26 years

By BILL PEEPLES

“Did you bring a cigars to
share with me?” asked’ College
Union Director C. Shaw Smith
as I seated myself in his
spacious office. I produced a
slender King Edward, a won-
derful device to break the ice.

When asked how long he had
been at his Davidson job, Smith
replied “twenty-six years, and
I’m fast catching on.”

When asked how long he had
been at his Davidson job, Smith
replied: “‘twenty-six years, and
I'm fast catching on.’’ A quar-
ter of a century at Davidson has
provided Smith with an office
that resembles the glass booth
with two-way mirrors like cas-
erators have in the
: from it, Smith can see
j ut anything happening
in the Union.

He sees to it that an awful lot

f things do happen. Consi-
dering the size of the student
body and the overall entertain-
ment budget, one. of Smith’s
biggest problems is bringing
“big name”’ performers to Davi-
dson.

This obstacle is often over-
come by the appeal Davidson
has to various celebrities. John
McKuen, who demands high
fees elsewhere, comes to David-
son for reimbursement of ex-

* penses and nothing more.

“They like the treatment, and
word gets around,” said Smith.

For instance, three years ago-

McKuen tentatively arranged
for fellow banjo player Steve
Martin to come for $600. ‘“‘Back
then of course, we had never
heard of him, and we just
didn’t follow up on it.

“Now he wants $200,000 or
something like that for a single
performance,’’ disclosed Smith,
with tears in his eyes.

Guest speakers are a delight
to bring Davidson, mainly be-
cause Davidson officials de-
mand more for the money.

‘‘Sydney Harris complained‘

that we worked his tail off,”
Smith said, but he is returning
this spring for another rigorous
visit.

For two solid days speakers
drag themselves to eight o’
clock classes, endure the con-
versation pit at ten, eat brown
lett: 1ce and yogurt at Minorities
luncheons, speak in the after-
noon. and evening, and finally
return to the Guest House for
Geritol and some shut eye.

Most seem to enjoy this type
of schedule. ‘‘Sydney Harris
went to one eight o’clock class
and told the students that they
were a bunch of damn fools for
getting up so early. ‘You’re
college studerits and can choose
later classes if you want to’ he
said. The professor didn’t think
it was funny, though, and really
got mad,” Smith’noted.

Buckminster Fuller was
another speaker who took his
Davidson stint seriously. Com-
“He was giving
a lecture up in, what do you call
the Dome Room, Perkins Audi-
torium is it, in a unique stream
of consciousness style that goes
on forever. The bell rang for
eleven o’clock-class, and stu-
dents started to leave.

‘“Sit down,’ he said. He was

just getting warmed up. ‘Why, ”

eee 9, 1979—The Davidecuian—7

you can go to class any day, but
you may never have the chance

. to hear me speak again."’’

Smith has come a long way
since the days. that he and a
secretary ran the College Union
alone. ‘My office used to be
behind the desk, and I worked
the desk myself most of the
time. Anytime someone had the
slightest problem, there I was
caught in the middle. Though I

' didn't realize it at the time, I

just wasn’t getting a bit of work
done."

Now C. Shaw, as he prefers to -

be called, commands an im-
pressive institution with a
sizable staff. ‘I love the in-the-
sky parlour,’’ as he ‘fondly
describes his new office.

Aside from speakers and

‘performers, he discussed some

of the more controversial issues
that surround the Union’s func-
tion. Leading up-to problems
concerning the role and use of
the 900 Room, he talked about
the Davidson of old.

‘Even in the days when the
rules and regs were tight and a
person could be expelled for

students themselves.

When the 900 Room first

The idea of checking 1.D.‘s
arose not as a means of pat-

of protecting their right to use

Asbury Jukes produce emotional,
driving, Jersey-style rock and roll

By JIM VITHA
Staff Correspondent

The advent of disco music as
a veritable American institution
in popular music has left the old
time rock and roller searching
desperately for an outlet for his
pent-up musical energies. Re-
cently, however, there have
been many groups and indivi-
duals who display admirable
efforts at satisfying the needs of

Performers such as Bruce
Springsteen, Bob Seger, Elvis
Costello and the Rolling Stones
have all enjoyed tremendous
popularity with recent albums
and concert tours.

One other group that cer-
tainly fits the mold of the true
rock and roll band is ‘Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes;
their latest album ‘Hearts of
Stone’’ does little to dispel this
image.

Born out of the bar scene at
the New Jersey shore, along
with another Jersey hero Bruce
Springsteen, the Jukes play a
type of music that is hard
driving, filled with gut feelings
and laden with rhythm and
blues. Images of bar-based
blues and Phil Spector’s tri-
umphs fill the Jukes’ music
with much force.

In fact, on the Jukes’ first
album, “I Don’t Want to go
Home,”’ Ronnie Spector, wife of
Phil Spector and former leader
of the Ronnettes, collaborated
with the Jukes on a Bruce
Springsteen song, ‘‘You Mean
So Much to Me,”’ and fre-
quently appears with the Jukes
in concert.

“Hearts of Stone’’ is similar
to the two other Jukes’ albums,
“I Don’t Want to go Home”
and ‘‘This Time It’s For Real”:
the music has the same base,
rhythm and blues, and the
instrumentation is quite simi-
lar.

However, “‘Hearts of Stone”
contains all original songs,
eight written by Steve Van
Zandt, the Jukes’ producer and

Bruce Springsteen’s guitarist,

and two written by: Spriageree
himself.

In the past, the Jukes have
used old standard songs in their
albums as well as new songs.
This fact gives ‘‘Hearts of
Stone”’ a fresh perspective and a
somewhat new direction for the
Jukes.

On the opening tune, ‘‘Got To
Be A Better Way Home” the
Jukes blast out with sure fire
Horns playing as a solid unit,
Southside Johnny singing in his
best style and Billy Rush, the
lead guitarist, coming up with
very solid ‘riffs. This formula —
runs throughout the album with
a couple of ballads added also.

On the ballads, especially the
title track and ‘‘Light Don’t
Shine,’ Southside Johnny dis-
plays his greatest talent. He
has an ability. to reach deep
inside and sing in a style that
cuts across conventional rock
and roll singing and simply puts
forth pure emotion in a capti-
vating way.

Other important features of
this album are the Miami.Horns
and guitarist Billy Rush: The
five Miami Horns distinctively
set off the Jukes with their very
tight melodic lines that are
played with a driving style and
as a single unit.

In the past, Billy Rush has
remained in the background,
being used as an occasional
addition to the Horns and
playing in a rhythm guitar
mold. However, Rush now
plays in a way which proves
that he can be used. to supply
the melodic line himself and
provide solos. of his own.

One-problem with ‘Hearts of
Stone"’ takes the form of a
conflict of interest. The Jukes
are desparately trying to prove
themselves as a solid recording.
unit and this excessive energy
can result in songs that are not
true to the Asbury Jukes’
nature.
