men. He stated that it will not be long
before all the colleges will have such
training, and that every man will prob-
ably be enlisted, or rather, every man
will be on the reserve roll, according to
his capacity for service, be he clerk, phy-
sician, mechanic, or what not. Should
trouble then arise, this reserve could he
called on, and every man will step into
service just in the place for which he is

The new Summer military

wards preparedness. A man mav go to
one of these and receive military instruc-

Summer. They certainly offer an op-

On Thursday night the Scrub basket
hall team was defeated by the fast Win-
ston-Salem High School team by — the
score of 33 to 22. The game ‘was hard
fought, altho Winston kept in the lead
thruout the entire contest. Winston
presented an excellently balanced team.
their passing, shooting and guarding be-
ing worthy of much praise, especially for
a high school team. The Serubs' play-
ine was decidedly off-color altho they
were able to make the count close by
means of pertodic rallies.

The plaving of Whaling and Crute

of the game. For Davidson, McAskill.

the game flourishing as
crowding baseball and track athletics for
vepular favor. Tt was just a quarter of
a century ago, namely, January 1s. 1892,
that the first match game of baskethall
was played. in Springfield, Mass. be-
tween two class teams of the Y. M. C.
A, training school. The sport was in-
vented by Dr. J. A. Naismith, then of
the Soringfield institution, but now of
the University of Kansas. It is esti-
mated that at least a quarter of a mil-
lion persons are plaving basketball as
members of regular clubs, and the. sport
has cpread all over the United States and
Canada, and to Europe. South Africa
and the Far Fast. In the earlv days af
the game there were as many as twenty
men on a side, but since 1896 there have
been five toa team. ‘The rules have been
standardized of late years, and hasketball,
in its improved form. promises to become
