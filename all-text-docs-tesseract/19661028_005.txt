‘CATS GO HOLLYWOOD

Actress Diane McBain, former star of the television series
“Surfside Six,’ visited the Wildcat roundballers’ practice
Tuesday to present the team with a 31 Inch “D”. Coach Lefty
Driesell said the “’D” signified “Diane, Defense and David-
son.” Along with the large D’, she gave each player a smatt
monogramed emblem. Miss McBain was in Charlotte attending
the convention of the North and South Carolina Film Exhibitors
Association. Her visit was also in conjunction with the Char.
lofte opening of her new movie with Elvis Presley tater this
month. Looking on, left to right, are Bob Pickens, Dave Moser,

Smith sees tomorrow's game
as a challenge to the team. ‘‘The

this is a most difficult time
because the boys are badly beat-

toughest game we'ye played.”

The Davidson cross.country

18-39 to East Carolina and 18-

Lexington, Va.

Bast Carolina and VMI each
took the first four spots against
the ‘Cats. Davidson was led by
Mike Moats, whose 23:02 was a

leader. Barry St. Clair, who set
a personal record of 21:54 in
his last outing, became ill dur-
ing the race and finished a dis-

in sixth against East Carolina.
Againsl VMI the top three
Wildcats took the same places.

The harriers’ double defeat

They will next run against High

John Puckett and Alan Pusey

Fogieman thought that’ David-
