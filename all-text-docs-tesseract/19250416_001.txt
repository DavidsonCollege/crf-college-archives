jers from being present. Both handicaps
| were remedied however, by substitutions.
| The Symphony Orchestra gave three
| performances instead of two, and Mack
| Lockhart rendered several guitar solos,
|accompanied by Proxy Thompson, in
|order to make up for the absence of the
Jazz Orchestra. The Earnest Brothers
furnished popular string music during
the intermission.

The stage of Shearer Hall was beau-
| tifully decorated with carly spring flow-
ers. Pots of dog-wood blossoms were
‘arranged across the front of the stage
and behind the foot lights. This was
ithe first feature performance of Junior
Speaking and a large crowd of “Firey”
visitors, as well as townspeople, was
present.

The first number was “The Joy of the
Hunter” by the entire chorus. This was
followed by the “Interrupted Serenade,”
after which Ed Wilson rendered several
| popular solos including “Honest and
| Truly.” After the Symphony Orchestra
|had given two selections the “Wildcat

| noise-making devices going full blast
Davidson students with their sweethearts
| were greeted at the gymnasium for the
‘final and biggest event of Junior Speak-
‘ing on the Hill Saturday night. For
;some days the committee had been hard
|at work, decorating the gym, practicing
| various parts, writing the magazine and
| doing the thousands of little thihgs nec-
|essary before such a circus could be
| put on effectively. On entering the gym
one was impressed by the decorations.
|The place truly resembled the Big Top
lof Barnum and Baileys. Class colors
| were used for carrying out the decora-
tion scheme, great streamers of purple
and gold were draped across the ceiling
and hung from the beams to make a
wall between the carnival proper and
the minstrel section. The southern end
was fixed up for the minstrel with quite
a large stage against one wall and a
section of bleachers for seats.

The fun started when the minstrel
chorus made their appearance with’ the
opening number, “All about Girls.” R.
E, Wilson sang the solo part and accord-
ing to one fair visitor he had the cutest
voice of the evening. With such a be-
ginning each following warbler tried to

In a game in which hitting seemed to

game, played in the new Piedmont Lea-
gue Ball Park in Salisbury. A consider-
able crowd present, overflowing

the score 8-3, Davidson doing all of her
scoring in the last three innings.

Things started off a lot worse than
they ended up. Holshouser, pitching for
Carolina, began by striking out three of
the first six Davidson batters while his
teammates got two doubles and a single
off Laird for a total of two runs in the
first inning, The Wildeats tightened up
in the second frame but Stanton’s double,
Gibson's single, a walk to Coffee, and
Johnson's triple in the third gave the
Winners three more runs, They added
three more tallys in the seventh when
Stanton lifted a long one over left field
fence for a home run, The other twor
came in when Gibson singled and came
in on Coffee's triple. Coffee scored on
Simpson’s wild throw home.

Davidson made two counters in the
seventh, on a walk given Wells and
singles by Wrenn, Laird and Davis, the
latter pinch hitting for Glenn, This ‘ral-
lly was stopped when Simpson tried to
home from second on Laird’s
| single and was caught at the plate by
the catcher, The other run was put
across in the ninth when Wells came in
frony third on Laird'’s long fly to center
| field. In all, Davidson made seven hits,
| none for more than one base. Coving-
jton led the batting with a brace of
singles. The double play, Covington to

the Davidson fielding. Laird made a
