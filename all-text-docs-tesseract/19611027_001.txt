Ninety-two favored extending
the exam period and 51 favored
shortening it. However, the
average number of days favored
by those who would change the
schedule was 8.2, only slightly
above the present 8-day sched-
ule.

Of the seniors voting, 45 fav-
ored continuing the present
policy, while 23 favored exten-
sion and 16 preferred to short-

| schedule for several free days.

“Twelve seniors opposed the

ent exam schedule, while 189
preferred some other system.
Senior Bob Bradford suggested
a supervised open exam per-
iod in which all exams would be
prepared and placed on the pro-
fessor’s desk. The student could
then take his exams in any or-
der he chose, provided that he
take at least one a day, begin-
ning the first day of the exam
period.

Approximately 400 students voted Tuesday in the Academic-Scheduling Poll
by the Student Council and THE DA VIDSONIAN. A majority of 249 favored

the scheduling of classes and
Rush Week at the same time,
and the fact that lest year the
Christmas holidays ended on

One sophomore commented,
“Now that the students have
something to say about the

is not aware will be avoided.”
