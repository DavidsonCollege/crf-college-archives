ALUMNI LUNCHEON.

As the shadows began to lengthen and
the biddies to gather around their mother
the old boys on the Hill Tuesday came
from every part of the town and campus
to assemble at the Y. M. C. A. for
alumni luncheon. Simultaneously began
to peal forth music’s sweet melody, a la
college songs, interrupted here and there
by spasms of yells from classes old and
young. The alumni in the embryonic
state were put to their best to out yell
their fellows of less hair and more whis-
kers. Under circumstances that both
aroused and hespoke the love of one hun-
dred and thirty fellows who are first,
last and all the time for Davidson, their
alma mater.

This was reunion year for all classes
that have graduated every fifth year
back. Hence, it might be said that the
banquet was in honor of the classes of
1916, 1911, 1906, 1901, 1886, 1881,
1876, etc. These were classes most in
evidence, but as the train cannot pass the
station without certain Sophomores being
there, so cannot a commencement be
“pulled off’ without ’93. The represen-
tation from all the intermediate classes
seemed to be larger than usual.

Tt was proven on this occasion that
men, like women, can do two things at
one and the same time. The annual
business meeting of the Alumni Associa-
tion was held while the menu was being
carried out per direction of the caterer
and to the delight of the fellows,

R. M. Miller, '76, Charlotte, N. C.,
was clected president for the ensuing
vear; W. T. Bailey, Greenwood, S. C..
’o6, vice-president: Dr. Jno. Wilson
McConnell, Davidson, N. C.. '02. sec-
retary. Trustees elected by the alumni
were Dr. Walter L. Lingle, Richmond,
Va., and A. L. Mills, Greenville, S. C.

W. T. Bailey, ’06, was toastmaster,
and the speeches were spicy—some witty.
some eloquent, all interesting. From
the time grace was said until the master
of ceremonies called attention to the fact
that the hour for the next number on the
day’s program had arrived. the meeting
was on the gallop. The “hit” of the
evening was a short oration by Dr.
Shearer, entitled “You would scarce ex-
pect one of my age.” Thus ended the
annual meeting of the Alumni Associa-
tion all too soon.

DISTINCTIONS ANNOUNCED | VISITING TRUSTEES

TROPHIES AND MEDALS

Immediately following the Junior
Orations, Dr. T. W. Lingle announced
the distinctions in scholarship for the
year, an account of such distinctions be-
ing found elsewhere in this issue. Judge
Jno. M. Dodge then presented the ath-
letic trophies: the class foot ball cham-
pionship cup to the Freshmen’s team, of
which J, Pickens was captain; the base
ball cup to the Sophomore’s team, of
which R. P. Richardson was captain;
and the track cup to the Sophomore’s
team, of which G. S. Crouch was cap-
tain.

The medals won during the past year
in the two Literary Societies, the Phil-
anthropic and the Eumenean, were pre-
sented by Rev. D. P. McGeachy. Four
inter-collegiate debater’s emblems were
awarded: for the Davidson-Erskine de-
bate to W. H. Neal and J. A. Thames;
for the Emory-Davidson debate to J. G.
Patton, Jr.. and F. H, Smith. The
Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medals to G. C.
Rellingrath in the Eu. and to G. F.
Webber in the Phi.: the Fresh-Soph de-
bater’s medals to G. C. Bellingrath in
the Eu. and to J. L. Fowle in the Phi.;

G. Edgerton in the Eu. and to R, H.
Ratchford in the Phi.:; the Escsayists med-
als to W. Y. Sayad in the Eu., and to
R. H. Ratchford in the Phi.; and the
Fiction medal from both societies to L.
A. Chambliss.

A vrize consisting of a medal and a
set of Shakespeare’s works, given by the
Independent Magazine for excellence in
composition connected with some phase
of Shakespeare’s life or works, was won
by I. A. Chambliss. Only members of
the Senior English class were eligible to
compete for this prize.

OFFICERS ELECTED BY
ATHLETIE ASSOCIATION

The annual meeting of the Athletic
Association for the nurpnse of electing
officers for the ensuing year was held
Thursday afternoon, Mav 25, in Shearer
Hall. At this meeting, characterized by
good order and a systematic dispatch of
business, capable and efficient men were
placed at the helm of the various oth-
letic activities at Davidson,

To the office of president of the asso-
ciation for the coming vear J. P. Laird
was elected by acclamation. Hugh Grey
was elected vice-president, and J. P. Mc-
Neill secretary-treasurer.

apers of foot ball, R. C. Jones and T.
W. Clark. A. S. Tompkins and T. A.
Finlev were elected by the association as

the Athletic Association.

AN INTERESTING FIND.

A very interesting find has recently
been made at Davidson. Some work-
men, while digging a ditch across Main
street, discovered a gold medal, which
proved to be a Fowle Orator’s Prize.
On one side was engraved the name “J.
W. Osborne. Charlotte, N. C.,.” and the
date “1878.” On the other side was the
motto “Bene dicere et recte agere.”” The
medal is round and has a ring in the top.
It is not tarnished in the least, being
practically as perfect as when new. The
owner of the medal is now Hon. James
W. Osborne. a prominent lawyer of
New York. The medal will be return-
ed to him by Mr. Parks, of the Bell
Telephone Co., as soon as his address can
be secured.
