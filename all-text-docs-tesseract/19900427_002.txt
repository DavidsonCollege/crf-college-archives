In its final report issued last
week, Davidson’s Task Force on
Student Life made dozens of rec-
ommendations for actions that
may make this campus a better
place for students to live.

Under the direction of Profes-
sor of Biology Jerry Putnam and
senior student Bill Scouten, the 24-
member task force took seven
months to study the situation on
campus and make its report.

The report was divided into
the areas of academic life and
community life. Community life
comprised social interactions, reli-
gious life, dormitory life, campus
security, Patterson Court and per-
sonal health. Norecommendations
werelisted asa higher priority than
others, butrecommendations were
made in all areas of study.

In academic life, recommen-
dations included: continued spe-
cial efforts to recruit black students,
faculty and administrators; study
of student complaints about the
lack of openings in popular classes;
implementation of gender studies
and African-American studies
courses; and improved advising.

In the field of social interac-
tions, the college should: better
educate students about the Code
of Responsibility; address the con-
cerns of ethnic minorities and inter-
national students; evaluate the
operations of the Dean of Students
office in terms of equal treatment
of men and women; publicize re-
sults of Honor Code and Code of
Responsibility hearings (without
names); hold programs to sensi-
tize students toracism and sexism;
support efforts to establisha tradi-

‘tionally black fraternity on cam-
pus; and hasten to complete reno-
vation of Johnston Gym for the
College Union.

In the field of religious life, the
college should: explore the feasi-
bility of opening a_meditati

chapel in the new College Union;
reinstate an ecumenical council to
coordinate religious activities on

campus; and help integrate stu-
dents into the life of Davidson
College Presbyterian Church.

In the field of dormitory life,
the college should: provide more

quiet study areas; upgrade the ~

quality of lounges;improvesuper-
vision of housekeeping and main-
tenance work; install emergency
lighting; and study theavailability
of student parking, especially
spaces convenient to classrooms.

Inthe field of campussecurity,
the college should: evaluate the
present dorm access system; as-
sure quick response to reports of
defective locks on doors and win-
dows; implement an SGA-sug-
gested lighting proposal; give stu-
dents active security education;and
establish a patrolling routine for
security officers.

In the field of Patterson Court
activity, the college should: hirean
advisor to help houses adhere to
the current alcohol policy and
ensure responsible drinking; insti-
tute a regular program of alcohol
education; establish a special task
force to analyze the role of alcohol
on campus and the study the ap-
propriateness of the present alco-
hol policy; establish a special task
force to study the present self-se-
lection system.

In the field of personal health,
the college should: reorganize the
counseling center to include two
full-time and one part-time coun-
selor; extend services in the infir-
mary; provide more privacy and
accommodations for womens
health problems in the infirmary;
and provide educational programs
through theinfirmary about nutri-
tion, AIDS and sexually transmit-
ted diseases.

Helms, Josh Hickman, Vanessa

Unique Agreement with Carolinas

Tong to Coordinate Program for Medical Humanities

With several Davidson stu-
dents gathered around a male pa-
tient’s bedside, Dr. Ronald Follmer
asked him to speak. The patient's
response was slurred and barely
comprehensible. Outside in the
hallway, Follmer explained to the
students that the neurological
impairment to the patient’s voice
box could be a symptom of Lou
Gehrig’s disease. One way to test
that possibility, Follmer said, was
toruna nerveconductiontest,and
he took the students to his lab and
hooked himself up to a computer-
ized electromyograph to demon-
strate the procedure.

was undoubtedly moreeffectively
learned in the midst of a bustling
hospital than in the quiet of a
campus classroom. That sort of

Med School Discussed

By GEORGE LAFAYE

Last week the Pre-Med Society
presented a talk from Lois Pounds
of the Duke Medical School on the
best strategies for those interested
in progressing to a medical school
after graduation. :

Pounds asserted that. profes-
sor recommendations and type of
activities has a greater importance
than small difference in grade-
pointaverages orstandardized test
scores. This is done to avoid dis-
criminating against students at
challenging schools where a B+
average may mean more than at
other colleges.

Pounds suggested that activi-
ties which show a real concern for
other peoplecount for more thana
large list of activities thatindicatea

student bucking for acceptance to
a post-graduate school.

As for specific numbers,
Pounds said that these were to
limiting and that at Duke they try
to look at the whole person.

She said that students with a
3.0 or better grade-point average

and double digit Medical College -

Admissions Test score stood on
about equal ground with recom-
mendations and personal charac-
teristics making the difference in
all the cases.

She also pointed out that It is
not necessary to bea science major
to be admitted to medical school.

In fact, she believes that an
outside major indicates a person
more willing tolearnand develop.

environment is now available to
Davidson students as a result of a
unique agreement that the college
and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Hospital Authorityrecently signed.
Theagreement pledges that the
twoinstitutions will exchange fac-
ulty and students, share labora-
tory facilities and speakers and
engage in joint research projects
and fund-raising efforts. Theagree-
ment gives a substantial boost to
the college’s new biomedical sci-
encesand medical humanities pro-
s.
Robert Williams, Davidson's
vice president for academic affairs,
said, “The agreement gives us a
connection to real-world medicine
on an organized and ongoing ba-
sis.”
It also essentially formalizes
several years of informal inter-
change between Davidsonand the
Carolinas Medical Center (formerly
Charlotte Memorial Hospital).
Hospital faculty members have
frequently spoken at Davidson to
students in Rosemarie Tong’s
medical ethics classes. Tong is

orthopedics students at the hospi-
tal. The hospital will employ seven

Davidson students as laboratory

assistants this summer.

In addition, the two institu-
tions have co-sponsored lectures
by several notable medical humani-
ties experts, as well as the annual
Speas Colloquium in medical
humanities.

Brockway explained, “The two
institutions havea mutual interest
in education and promoting the
highest quality healthcare. Iteases
and facilitiates thingsif wehavean
arrangement to foster interaction.”

He said this represents a won-
derful opportunity for Davidson
students. “Our students will beable
to see in a very complicated social
milieu many academic disciplines
coming tobearonacommon prob-
lem — human health. There’s eco-
nomics, technology, engineering,
statistics, witicn ss at the heart of
it all is human decision making.
The outcome is the quality of
someone’s life. That exposure is a
wonderful dimension to a liberal
arts education.”

.. According to Dr. Bill Williams,
director of Charlotte Area Health
Center and senior vice president
for medical education and research
atthe hospital, Davidson offers his
group someattractive resources as
well.

Heexplained that the hospital
has a full-time faculty of 55 who
teach 130 residents. There are also
more than 200 medical students,
most of whom attend UNC-Chapel
Hill Medical School. In January the
state designated Carolinas Medi-
cal Center as an academic medical
center teaching hospital, one of only
five statewide. With that has come
a determination to expand its basic
science research. Williams said
Davidson faculty members and
students will help the hospital fac-
ulty with basic research projects.

medical humanities concentration,
Davidsonis taking an unusual step
for an undergraduate school, and
we havea research effort here that
you don’t traditionally find in a
community hospital. It seems to
me that both institutions are step-
ping toward each other with these
non-traditional programs. We be-
lieve the relationship will make
more out of community resources
tharf either could alone. “
Davidson hasarichheritageof
pre-medical training, and the new
medical humanities program up-
dates that emphasis. Tong, who
was national professor of the year
in 1986, said that Davidson is one
ofa handful of undergraduate col-.
leges in the nation with such a
program. Her job is to coordinate
course development, speakers and
thenew agreement with Carolinas
Medical Center into a comprehen-
sive whole that will give Davidson
students an overview of the com-
plex picture of modern medicine.
