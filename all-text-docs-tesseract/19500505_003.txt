‘ Jamerson’s Lads Put Up Good Fight

But Bow To League Leading Pack

By CHARLIE HAWKINS -

Coach Charlie Jamerson’s baseball 'Cats dropped a hard
fonght game to the N. C. State Wolfpack in Raleigh Thursday.
The score was 9-6, and it gave the rampaging Pack their 10th
straight win. They now lead the southern division of the south-
ern conference. State jumped to a 5-run lead in the last half

Thus we move into a year of Cat Tales that you and I must
suffer through alike. I’m just trying to make it easier on you,
dear reader, because I consider the appointment a truo honor
(although I tabbed it ‘‘dubious’’), I never guessed anyone
thought I had the ability. Now all I have to do is keep ‘em
fooled.

There'll be two more Davidsonians this spring after this edi-
tion. I started to write on the forthcoming Southern Conference
tennis tourney here, but decided to save that one for a little
meat to chew on next week end. The big show will be in full
swing by then, and there might be some extra poop we can fur-
nish on the entrants. As Mr. Furman Bisher, past editor of the
Charlotte News and a gentleman of the price whom we have al-
ways held in high esteem, stated in his first column as sports
editor of the Atlanta Constitution, the first column is generally
only a lot of baloney from the orientation market w hieh’ folks
will digest as ‘‘the guy’s first try,””

‘‘WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE...”

We're (haven't decided whether to use ‘“‘we’’ or “T?) inelin-
ed to feel that a statement of policy is forthcoming from the
fellow who has the top spot on the sports page for saying what
ke pleases. That overline line there by copy-boy Honest Abe is
No. 1. We go into this thing absolutely unprejudiced toward
any party, club, frat, or what-have-you. Probably don't know
enough to be prejudiced. At any rate, it is ‘‘with malice toward
none.’’ Let’s hope we'll have guts enough to say what displeas-
es us, but at the same time tact and manners enough to say it in
a constructive fashion. May we go on record that anything said.
in this column for the coming year is not asserted with malicious
intent.

. WITH CHARITY FOR ALL...”

... and there is No. 2. Honor to whom honor is due, in this
ease. Perhaps charity is hardly the word for it. We don't want
to give any one credit unless he’s got it coming. Not that we
want to be stingy with praise. It just seems logical that a pat on
the back means more when the recipient can’t get them tw6-for-
a-nickle at the five-and-dime.

Especially at Davidson where we swear by ‘the Wildeat spirit
do we want to give honor to whom honor is due. Nothing ean
help a club or individual more than recognition. It seems to us
that this thing of recognition of all worthy athletic participants,
varsity, frosh, and intra-mural, is one of the primary functions
of a college sports page. It is the school’s own organ of praise.

Thus, we are ready to continue the fine job which Cordon
and others have accomplished in the past. Particularly in this
yealm would we like to continue ‘‘ Wildeat of the Week,’’ a fea-
ture designed for acclamation of outstanding performers for old
D. C.

‘‘WITH FIRMNESS IN THE RIGHT .

Any baseball or basketball ump or ref can tell you in a second
the first rule of calling either game is to mahe your decision
quickly and then stand by it. That often takes a lot of fortitude
We are going to strive to see them right the first time, and
after we call them stick by them.

It is the privilege and responsibility of the appointee for ex-
pressing his views on the sports world about him to do so. As

A surprisingly strong Washing-
ton and Lee track team, coming
through in the final two events,
edged Davidson's Wildcats 69% to

61% for Coach Heath Whittle's cin-
dermen’s‘ second loss in six starts
at Lexington, Va., ldst Saturday.

The Generals, who completely
blanked Davidson’s crack Ken
Goodpasture on the 100 and kept
the stocky little speedster shoved
back to third on the 220, turned in
a swift 3:31 mile relay and a final
javelin héave of 177 feet in the
day’s last two contests to fashion
the triumph. Partly responsible for
the W&L win on the relay was
quarter-miler Jay Handlan, better
known for his basketballing, who
clicked off a $1-flat on the 440 and
came near equalling that mark on
his lap of the relay.

Pete White, the General's hurd-
ling ace, captured both timber-top-
ping events as well as second in the
broad jump for scoring honors with
13 points. Captain Jim Vann, win-
ning the discus and shot put, paced
Davidson with 10.

innings while the Cats were scor-

inning with 2 runs. Page, the State
pitcher, hit Auburn Lambeth and
Mac Erwin in succession, and sin-
gles by Billy Houck and Charlie

was relieved by Sam Welch, and
the rally was quelled when catcher

Gastonia Tops Frosh;

Gaither, Erwin Win

By JIM SMITH

The Davidson freshmen golf
team dropped another close match
12%—14% to a potent Gastonia
High School team at Meyers Park
in Charlotte Wednesday. There
were, however, some bright points
in the meet as our No. 1 and 2 men
came through with sparkling hon-
ors. Al Gaither and Lawrence
“Red” Ervin won their match by a
lop-sided score of 8%—%. Law-
rence Irvin of Morganton was the
top man of the match being the
medalist with low score of 78. Bill
Bristow and Lewis Barnes almost
managed to gain a split in their

| match. Final score of their match

was in favor of Gastonia 5%—3%.
The last match of the day proved to
be the deciding factor in the final
score. Vernon Clifton and George
Crouch couldn't seem to get going
fand were badly beaten by the score
of 8%—"%. This match gave Gas-
tonia the needed margin for the
win. ,

Sloan Sole Winner
For Cat Linksters
In Durham Rounds

By WOODY McKAY |

Duke University's linksters gave
their Wildcat visitors a warm wel-
come on the Devil’s Hope Valley
course by downing them 23% to
3%.

Jimmy “Slimy” Sloan was the
only Wildcat to gain a victory
against the Blue Devils although
Hill played well to finish with a 71
total.

Duke's No. 1 clubber, Louis Mc-
Lennan, took the honors of the day
by swinging to a.below par 67. His
teammate, Frank Pollock, stepped
into third place with a 73.

The Durhamites were playing in
above average form, and the Wild-
cats couldn't overcome the Blue
Devils except in one pairing. This
is one of the worst losses the un
coached Wildcat linksters have
had this year, and added one more
loss to their conference play.

The summary is as follows:

McLennon (Duke) defeated Hill,
3-0.

Glenn (Duke) defeated McLean,
2-1, ‘°

Duke won best ball, 3-0.

Sloan (Dav.) defeated Reed, 2-1.

Pollock (Duke) defeated Dick-
son, 3-0.

Duke won best ball, 3-0.

Souchak (Duke) defeated Bran-
don, 3-0.

Hanes (Duke) defeated Vernon,

Duke won best ball, 3-0.

men 5-2 on last Monday.

Tech scored first in the second
inning after two were away. Earl
Gunter doubled, and Don Brady
walked. McCaskill then blasted a
double to score both Gunter and
Brady. Tech added single runs in
the third, fourth, and seventh.

With none away for Davidson
in the eighth Jim Farrar walked
and Burt Downs singled to left.
Whisnant popped out and Jetty
Morrow fanned. Smith then singled
Farrar and Downs home. The Wild-
kittens added two more in the
ninth. Jim Smith went the route for
the losers.

"Cats Bow to USC. in Home Finale

By DICK LILES

Tt was a beautiful Saturday af-
ternoon last week when the Wild-
cat baseballers behind the steady
hurling of Dutch Hengeveld romp-
ed on Southern Conference second
placers Clemson by 6-4. Henge-
veld went the route for the Cats
pitching brilliant five-hit ball.

The locals hopped quickly on
the Tigs’ hurler Ford in the first
frame by collecting two runs. The
Clemson nine also pushed across
one in the first inning and one in
the fourth and were tied with the
Cats 4-4 by the big Sth inning.
The deadlock, however, was broken
in the 7th and 8th when the locals
used late inning wildness and er-
rors to collect a run in each of
the two remaining innings. The
Eats collected only five hits just
as Clemson and committed five
errors, but turned them into the
second win of the season, both be-
ing Conference victories.

South Carolina

Tuesday afternoon the U. of

South Carolina Gamecocks defeated
the local nine in their last home
contest of the season 8-5. It was a
return Southern Conference tilt in
which the South Carolinians took
both ends.

Davidson went ahead in the 4th
inning 5-4 on a two-run double,
but the Roosters rallied in the 7th
with 2 runs on 2 singles, an error
by Davidson, and a hit batsman.
Then they added a marker in each
of the last 2 innings of play.

The Cats slugged the ball well
in the contest getting 8 hits. Charlie
Pearson, Bill Bird, and Mac Erwin
each smashed a double and Hal
Mapes slugged a triple. Also to
their credit, Bill Houck pulled a
double play with  firstasacker
Mapes. Craven and Hengeveld
combined to strike out five men,
but giving up 11 hits. The winning
pitcher was Camp, the second Caro-
lina hurler, and Craven is charged

with the loss.

—_, ~|Conference Championship Eludes
Netters By Margin of One Match

By BILL

Davidson’s tennisters fought
William and Mary's powerful In-
dians through four hours of scin-
tillating tennis Thursday afternoon
but just couldn't quite get a firm
enough grip on the victory wreath
and: allowed the Indians to snatch
a 5-4 decision, The match was
supposed to settle the Southern
Conference title but another chance
will come to the Cats for revenge
in the Conference Tournament to
be held at Davidson later:in the
month. This tournament officially
decides the Conference champion.

Thursday’s match was the first
showing made by Derrick’ Barton's
charges on their long northern trek.
Matches with Yale and Haverford
were rained out and even the Wil-
liam and Mary match had to be de-
layed a day.

Possibly the biggest surprise to
Davidson supporters was the de-
feat of both Bo Roddey and Teddy
Keesler, the Cats top two men.
Roddey lost to Indian ace Howie
Atwater in 3 sets and Keesler also
went 3 sets before bowing to Boys.
Whit. Cobb and Allan Fanjoy_ took
straight set wins for Davidson, but
Allan Strand and Rob Palmer both

Tbe

ADAMS

went down in 3 set battles.

| In the doubles, Roddey and Cobb
disposed of Atwater and Chen-
nault, Keesler and Fanjoy beat An-
thony and Boys, but Strand and
Dewey Keesler were beaten by
Woods and Darnes.

All of the matches were close, as
the four hours required tq complete
them verifies. William and Mary
has lost but one match this year and
none in the last three years. They
are the defending team champions
of the Southern Conference but
Davidson’s showing against them
Thursday gave positive proof that
the Indian supremacy is beginning
to totter. A 5-4 team score with 4
of the Cat defeats going 3 sets ,
leaves plenty of room for optimism
and speculation in what might have
been. In reference to the Davidson-
William and Mary tennis rivalry, it
leaves plenty of room for specula-
tion in what might be in the future.

Summaries:

Atwater, WM, defeated Roddey,
6-2, 0-6, 6-3.

Boys, WM, defeated Keesler; 7-5,
4-6, 6-4.

Cobb, D, defeated Anthony, 6-1,
