Colgate aerials deflate Wildcat hopes

By STAN BROWN
Staff Writer

Colgate’s Red Raiders in-
vaded Richardson Field Sat-
urday and handed the Wild-
cats a 17-7 opening game loss.

The first quarter proved to
be the difference as Colgate
rolled up a 10-0 lead.

Davidson had: been unable
to capitalize on two fumbles
by the visitors when Pete
Legler’s second punt attempt
was blocked. The Cats’ de-
fense held fast but Jerry
Andrewlavage found the range
with a 44-yard field goal to
make it 3-0.

The next time Colgate got
the ball a 58-yard scoring
drive increased their lead to
ten points.

In the second quarter Dav-
idson’s offense managed its
initial first down when Legler
scooped an errant snap at his
own five and advanced thirty
yards back for an overall gain
of one.

This effort avoided a prob-
able.Colgate score that could
have put the game out of
range.

After a scoreless second
quarter, the Wildcats got ar-
other break when Mike Pesk-
osky forced a fumble at Col-
gate’s twelve yard line. The
offense took it in on freshman
Craig Pyles’ seven yard run on
a counter play.

Chuck Bohertz converted
and suddenly it was a 10-7 ball
game.

However, Colgate came
back to control the second half
offensively, eventually driving
70 yards to score and put the
contest out of reach. The
Davidson offense continued its
inability to sustain a drive and
it was Colgate’s ball game.

Coach Ed Farrell expressed
optimism after having viewed
the films. Although the pass
defense was pierced 12 of 15
times for 165 yards, the over-
all defense was much im-
proved over last year.

‘‘We’re staying with our
coverage. We always seemed
to be just one step from being
there,” he said.

He cited Jim Nichols and
Paul Andrews for consistent

Coaeh-adds three recruits, -
strenghtens Netter’s depth

By DOUG SCHUESSLER

After a disappointing 5-21
season last year under former
head coach Robert ‘‘Bo”’
Brickels, the future of David-
son basketball is looking up.

Led by new head coach
Dave Pritchett, the Wildcats
seem to have strengthened
many important aspects of
their game.

Although hurt by a late
start in recruiting, Pritchett
still managed to come up with
three fine players: Earnie Rei-
gel (from Michigan), Tim
Bowker (New Jersey) and Rod
Owens (New York). They

“Statistically, Larry Crees

had a good game at tight end
on offense,”’ said Farrell.

The offensive line also drew
praise, allowing just four

tribute additional board
strength, while also giving the
team extra mobility. °

This year’s squad will be a
young one, with only three
juniors or seniors. However,
Pritchett does not look upon
the 1976-77 year as a building

_ one.

‘There is no doubt in:‘my
mind. We are going to win at
Davidson,’’ he said.

Pritchett plans to work for
the “percentage shot’’, while
utilizing the Wildcats’ re-
bounding strength and ball
control. He also plans to ‘‘run
with control.

‘My job is to make them
the best basketball players
humanly possible and to get
the maximum from their tal-
ent,” said Pritchett,

Pritchett has previously
coached at state colleges, Bos-
tori College, where he was
instrumental in turning their
basketball program’ around,
and the University of Mary-
land, where he was a top assis-
tant to Lefty Driesell.
