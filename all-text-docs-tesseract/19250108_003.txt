I realized that I could never become a
great orator like Bob LaFollette (peo-
ple say I look just like him) for my skin
was sallow, had liver spots on it, and
pimples. People did not turn around in
the street to look at me, the babies did
not love to caress my cheeks; something
had to be done, as my life was a failure.
With my youthful hope of becoming an
orator blasted I took up palmistry as I
could wear a turban and veil and peo-
ple could not see my visage. One day |
while gazing into the crystal I saw my-
self in an ad; below my picture was this
slogan, “Keep that School Girl Com-

of youth and the pink of a peach. |
