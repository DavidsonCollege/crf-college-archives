L. B., Gibbs traced the development of the

A. C, Ray, in his speech entitled The Pass-

development of the great civilizations of the
world, the Persian, Old and New Babylonian,
the Greck, the Roman, and finally the Eng-

the final destiny for which they were in-

F. C. Hopkins, speaking on Brotherhood,

Proposed move on accougt of the internal
condition of the country; that self-govern-
ment had been a failure; that the Philinipos
did not have a stable government. The
judges were Messrs. Pharr and Boyd, of
Mooresville, and Hull, of Charlotte. Their
decision was unanimously in favor of the
affirmative.

At Wake Forest, the Davidson team, L.
Williams, L. D. Wharton and E. R. Erwin,
upheld the negative against T. W. Baker, C.
R. Tew and Ralph Carlton. The arguments
advanced were very much the same as those
used at Davidson. The judges in this de-
bate were Messrs. J. A. Livingstone, S. R.
Sygerly and Dr. Thomas D. Harrison, all-of

favor of Wake Forest.

‘Sunrise Service Beneath |
Boughs Easter Morning

Henry Paterson, ’22, Leads Devo-|
tional Services—Many Students
and Visitors Attend |

A group composed of volunteers, min-
isterial students, members of the Chris-|
|tian Endeavor Training Class and visit- |
ing friends met on the golf links Easter
morning for a “sunrise service.”

In spite of the lively time Saturday

night, about 4o students and visiting girls
gathered at 7:30 Easter morning when
Henry Patterson, ’22, now at Union Sem-
jinary led them in a quiet and impressive
service.
| After several hymns and a prayer by
Harry Price, Henry Patterson led the
main devotion. His theme was taken
| from I John 4:8 “God is love.” Attention
was called to the glory of God's creation
in evidence all about bursting ° buds,
caroling birds, spring everywhere, but
God is only the Maker of it all. Patter-
;son urged the group to remember the
| victory of the Cross, to place complete
trust in our risen Lord, remembering
[that in the Cross is perfect love offered
| to a lost world. Sentence prayers were
| offered by almost every member of the
|group followed by “Seal Us Oh Holy
| Spirit,” sung by the entire band.

| While the beauties of new springtime
jand the glories of the wonderful Easter
/morning shone round about, there seem-
| ed to be a new life in the hearts of those
|who worshipped in the glory of the
great out-of-doors. Surely Easter meant
more to those who went to such a quiet
place to meditate upon the true meaning
of our Lord’s day. All went away feeling
that it was good to have been there, to

the Davidson College Magazine. Gallaway
has also shown himself a critic worthy of
note. He is also a member of the track
team, of which he was captain last year.

certain campus activity. He has proven his
worth in required school work as well as
with the publications and literary societies of

tour being denied them by the faculty,
because ofthe extended tri-state tour of
last fall. The faculty also declined to
allow the club to compete for state
honors at the State Glee Club meet in
Durham, because it would have neces-
sitated the loss of a day’s work. The
work of the club this’ spring has been a
thorough success, in spite of restriction,
and the Wildcat musicians still wear the
laurel crown they won on the fall tour.
