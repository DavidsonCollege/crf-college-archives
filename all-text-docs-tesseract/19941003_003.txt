Student nearly arrested as a result of dunking booth fiasco

By Laura Dennis

Although Lunar Luau was a
great success this year, it did not
come off without a hitch. On the
Monday evening following the
event, Geoff Graham, social chair
of Kappa Sigma, received a call
from the Charlotte Police, who said
they had a warrant for his arrest.

Graham had been accused of
stealing the dunking machine used
atLunarLuau. The man whorented
the booth had only Graham’s name
on the invoice,

Surprised and scared at the
prospect of being arrested, Gra-
ham explained to the police that

‘there must

have been a
misunder-
standing and
that he would
return’ the

dunking ma-
chine as soon
as possible.
The police reluctantly backed off,
and Graham set out to resolve the
dilemma.

The dunking machine was
used at the Lunar Luau booth which
represented all of Patterson Court.
The Kappa Sigs rented the ma-

Graham

chine under Graham’s name,
picked it up from an entertainment
company in Charlotte, and set it up
on Friday, The other Patterson
Court houses each had duties, such
as manning the booth during the
event; some—but not all—of the
houses fulfilled their duties. —

At the end of the night, Sig Ep
was assigned to clean out the booth
and then return it to the company
on Monday. However, according
to Sigma Phi Epsilon President
Bill Rodin, he was never notified
of the fraternity’s assigned task.
Therefore, the booth was left on

Bookstore non-scandal
uncovered: students not
ripped off by bookstore

By Matthew Eirich

After purchasing books forthe
upcoming semester, most students
leave feeling shell-shocked and
angry after spending hundreds of
dollars on books. But most stu-
dents blame the profiteering book-
store for the astronomical bill. Such
blame is erroneously placed.

The Operation

The Davidson College book-
store is owned by the college and
managed by Gwen Gardner. But
Gardner explains that the college
does not fund the bookstore to pay
for merchandise, salaries, postage,
and other expenses. Thus, the
bookstore must generate its own
funds for its operating costs.

Pricing policies for the book-
store are determined by many fac-
tors. One year in advance the book-
store must submit a budget which
itestimates will cover its operating
expenses for the next year. After
the budget is determined, a profit
margin is decided upon to meet
that budget. If a miscalculation
was made and the budgets too low
or too high, the profit margin is
similarly altered to reflect the new
calculation.

The actual prices are set by
Gardner, but she says, “The ad-
ministration sets requirements for
the bookstore and determines our
policy, and then it is up to us to
meet whatever guidelines they give
us.”

The profits from the book-
store stay within the college. Prof-
its are pooled into a general fund
administered by the Vice-Presi-
dent for Finance.

Fromthere, profits are shuttled
to various student activities. The

profit margin is in part then an-

activities tax.
Profit Margin
Every textbook has a profit
margin attached to it. Often this is
the suggested retail price, but as
Gardner explains, at times the vari-
ous publications from the univer-

sity presses sell at lower than the
suggested retail price._Addition-
ally, when dealing with more ex-
pensive textbooks, the margin is
lower than average in order to
lessen the cost.

The bookstore tries to “keep a
low margin” on textbooks because
students have no other choice but
to buy from the store, explains
Gardner.

Also, to help defray the cost of
textbooks, the profit margin is in-
creased in other areas of the book-
store. This is because non-text-
book items are not essential and
because much of the merchandise
is not purchased by students but by
alumni and visitors to the campus.
These patrons help to keep the cost
of textbooks down, notes Gardner.

Buy-Back and Used Books

Buy-back and used books are
handled through an independent
wholesale company. Ifthe book is
to be used again at Davidson, the
company pays the student half the
new price at buy-back. If it is not
to be used again, the company is at
liberty to make any offer, which
Gardner noted may only be 30
cents on the dollar.

The bookstore sells used text-
books at 75% of the price of new
textbooks. Gardner stresses that
the bookstore tries to “maximize
used books” since those are the
leastexpensive option for students.

Also, the bookstore has no
control over professors’ textbook
selections for upcoming semesters.
The bookstore tries to predict which
books will be used again-so that
students might maximize their re-
turns when they buy them back;
consequently, the used books will
be less expensive for the following
semester,

Gardner notes that many pro-
fessors make the conscious deci-
sion to use paperback books and
anthologies which are “cheaper”
for the students and keep the
courses more “current.”

the field after the event. Rodin
says, “It was not our fault because
no one-told us anything about it.”

After the-call from the police,
Graham found the dunking booth
leaning against the side of Johnston
Gym and promptly called the man
from whom he had rented the ma-
chine. The owner said that the
reason he called the police instead
of contacting Graham directly was
that he “had trouble with frat boys
before” who destroyed or ran off
with his merchandise, and he just
wanted to let the police handle this
one.

Students purchase books in the bookstore even though they complain about prices.

nary session on Friday. The trust-
ees may then vote on the resolution
at their next session in January.

"We plantokeep working until
we achieve our goal,” says
Rosenbach.

October 10 because the
editors need a break. °

On Tuesday, Rodin receiveda
call from Graham asking him if he
oranother one of the Sig Eps would
take it back to the owner that day.
Because of the late notice, no one
could return it on Tuesday.

Finally, on Wednesday, PCC
President Josh Worsham returned
the machine, Worsham says the
situation “was basically a mix-up
about who was supposed to return
[the booth].”

No charges were filed by the
police, but Patterson Court must
pay two days in late fees, which
amount to three hundred dollars.
