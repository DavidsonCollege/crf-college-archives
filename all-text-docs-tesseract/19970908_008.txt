Taming the Commons beast: The Pulper

A skeptical reaction to the new “environmentally friendly” practices of the Commons

: aste disposal is not a
! pretty topic, but then nei
. ther is war, poverty, or

crime.” So true.
Sq begins a flyer distributed

to be a part of this trend. So to
decrease the amount of waste that
the Commons sends to the landfill, -
they bought the Pulper. The Pulper
grinds paper waste and dehydrates

this week it, thereby
titled, “Re- . pees decreasing
cycling at the Accorpine To Hospice dishroom
Commons.” waste by
I'll tell you Matthew Hobbie | 80%.

what else — But—
isn’t a pretty and here’s

topic among students: recent
changes at Vail Commons. For
those unaware, Vail Commons has
become enslaved to a mythical, yet
very real, beast called “The Pulper.”

Have you heard it—the grum-
bling and roaring deep in the cav-
ernous bowels of the Commons?
It’s waiting, waiting for you! It tells
the managementevil lies about how
wasting more natural resources is
good for the environment and how,
after it weaves it’s magical spell,
more trash becomes less than be-
fore.

The Pulper — capital P — re-
sides in our dishwashing area, right
where that poor guy they fired to
make room for the new machine
used to stand. Actually, after some
investigation, I found that the rea-
son for both the disposable cups
and the silverware tub (another prob-
lem) is because the Pulper ate the
man who used to’ take the silver-
ware off the trays and wash the
glasses. Poor guy, he was a
Davidson grad, too.

Here’s the argument presented
on the widely-read flyer: Although
waste rose by 32 million cubic yards
between 1988 and 1993, the per-
cent that food services contributed
in that time fell by .33%. Because
responsible waste disposal is im-
portant to the Commons, they want

the catch—this voracious beast
needs more trash than we have been
producing to operate properly, so
the Commons says that we need to
use paper cups instead of glass.
What about the paper napkins? They
say that, since they are made of
recycled paper, they are worthless
for the Pulper’s needs.as they “liter-
ally melt when subjected to water.”

That’s true! The other day I

. wiped my face with one and it com-

pletely disappeared! Neat trick.
It’s a good thing, too. You don’t
want the napkins to actually work.
You want them to look good, and
they do!

I’m so glad they printed the
Davidson logo on all of them. Oth-
erwise, most of us would forget
where we go to school and forget

_ one of the reasons why our families

are paying over a tenth of a million
dollars for us to be here. Printed
napkins are an important part of
anyone’s education. .

Anyway, magically, after the
use of the Pulper, the 72 cubic yards
of trash per week at the Commons
fell to the 16 yards of trash excreted
by the Pulper. By my calculations,
this is a truly impressive reduction
of 77%. (Calculus, baby.)

There are a few problems with
our current situation. One, if the
Pulper needs paper cups, why have

we been using Styrofoam for the
last two weeks?

If they “see waste disposal as
(their) social responsibility to pro-
tect our environment,” why are they
wasting even more materials by
using Styrofoam (that, last time I
checked, destroyed the ozone layer)
for ice cream, too?

Two, the Pulper defies the laws
of common sense. Essentially, the
message is that we need to create
more waste to produce less. Huh?

The Commons may be con-

nance, you need to return to the line
multiple times. For those of us who
are in too much of a hurry to get that

fourth thimble-full, we leave the ~

Commons lacking vital fluids.

Also, the cups spill easily.
Before you set your tray down at a
table, you’ ve spilled half your drink,
further increasing your lack of flu-
ids, and have melted your beauti-
fully-printed napkin. How many
students must die from dehydration
before glasses are used?

Money, surprisingly enough,

verware in tubs may not seem like a
big deal, it is wasteful and tacky.
We deserve better, and so does the
Commons. I believe the Commons
wants to serve and help students.
They can help us most by helping to
make Davidson feel more like home
and I, at least, don’t use disposable
cups at home.

The Pulper may make sense at
other institutions, but when one is
forced to create more waste and
decrease the quality of service, it
makes no sense at all.

For these rea-
sons, I, Matthew

“For these reasons, |, Matthew Hobbie, summon all to a
crusade to vanquish this beast. Once again, the students
must act, and quickly. If not, you may soon hear this
phrase: ‘Welcome to beautiful Chez Vail, here’s your

au“

spork.,

Hobbie, summon
all to a crusade to
vanquish this beast.
Once again, the stu-
dents must act, and
quickly! If not, you

cerned about the environment, but
they seem to be going in entirely the
wrong direction. The Pulper may
make sense in terms of the volume
of trash sent to the landfill, but how
is cutting down more trees and cre-
ating more harmful compounds like
Styrofoam for cups good for the
environment?

Is it just me, or do glasses seem
to be a more environmentally-
friendly alternative? Glass is reus-

able and recyclable if necessary (al-

though our recycling service mys-
teriously does not accept glass). As
for the necessary fiber for the Pulper,
we could kill two birds with one
stone by substituting Honor Code
infringers for the cups. That’s fiber
for you!

Thirdly, the disposable cups
are not big enough. To wash down
your delicious Commons. suste-

may also be a factor in this discus-
sion. It’s expensive to have glasses.
You have to pay someone to wash
them and replace them when they
break. At the same time, 100 paper
or Styrofoam cups are probably sold
fora penny. They also have to pay
for fewer drinks, since we’ re drink-
ing them out of a bottle cap.

But you know what? Quality
costs. As far as I know, the price of
meal plans hasn’t gone down this
year, but the quality of the dining
experience has, and students have
noticed.

The Commons staff is as sweet
as ever and has nothing to do with
this problem, unless “The Pulper”
was their idea. If you haven’t said
hello toa friendly Commons worker
today, you’re missing out.

Nevertheless, while using small
disposable cups and putting our sil-

may soon hear this
phrase: “Welcome
to beautiful Chez
Vail, here’s your spork.” I’m tell-
ing you, it is on the way. Students,
we must unite!

After our quest is finished and
we have drunk the sweet nectar of
victory (out of a glass), we can go
celebrate at the Union, a place that
is more an idea than a building,
where our unity can live and grow
until our next challenge appears.
The unifying Union events this week
are: Lunar‘Luau featuring the Hur-
ricane Hugo Juggling Festival with
Mark Nizer (The Bad Boy of Jug-
gling), a Women’s Issues Commit-
tee organizational meeting, two
screenings of the French film, “La
Haine,” and as always, Jumpin’ Java
and Coffee House.

_ Check your calendar for loca-
tions and times.

Fight the good fight, and I'll
see you at the Union!

Buster speaks his mind, plugs his stuff

Ride the Vamanos Van, run for SGA, and make Buster's dreams come true

hope that everyone at Davidson
I got to ride the Vamanos Van
this weekend. If you didn’t get
"a chance to, there’s always next
weekend:
Thursday
through
Saturday,
7:00 p.m.
to 1:00

way anywhere in the greater
Cornelius and Huntersville area.
You can sign up to run for an

office on the SGA or the Honor

Council in the Dean of Students
office through tomorrow by 5 p.m.
There are six positions for the fresh-
man class, six positions for
’ Independant senators, and three po-
sitions open on the Honor Council
for the sophomore, junior, and se-
nior classes. There will be speeches

_this year for those running forthe —

SGA at 4:00 p.m. Sunday on the
Chambers steps. There will be food
and drinks there, andI hope that you
will come cheer on your friends as
they
rattle off
two-
minute
speeches
about
what’s
wrong with the world, and how
they’re going to fix it.

Ann Harriott Fisher. and I went
around to the freshman halls last
week to inform them about the up-
coming elections. I lived ona fresh-
man hall last year, and knew my

hall and their many visitors. But.

this year, as we walked around, I
was much more of an observer of
the ways of the halls than a partici-
pant. Boys hung around the
doorframes, cold-chillin’ in and
outside of the rooms (actually hang-
ing from the door frames so that

girls walked around the halls in
search of that soccer guy from the
facebook or just looked like they
were looking for someone, and ab-
solutely nothing had changed from
when I was a freshman. Everyone
was having fun and looking out for
their friends and their friends-with-
benefits. I’ve always thought it’d
be great to re-live freshman year,
when GPAs and getting a job
weren’t

man year.

People always say that they
“wished (they) were 18, uh-gain”
(Jerry Lee Lewis and my father),
but would they, you, me, want to
relive it, knowing that even the
things that seem most earth-shatter-
ing freshman year or senior year or
whenever, the things that are-the
spice of life at the time, are very
trivial, and even sometimes incon-

ing about meeting the right person
or missing that opportunity? Who
knows? And if I just shaved off
three years of my life to begin
anew, why would I ever want to
live through that again without hav-
ing the foresight of how to live it?
All this stuff really kills me.

I wouldn’t want to know that-I had
