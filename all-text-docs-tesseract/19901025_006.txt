Notes on Calendar Changes
and the Great Towing Controversy

By DAVID SCOTT '92

Proposed changes in the aca-
demic calender and the increasing
tendency for illegally parked cars
to get towed have inspired heated
columns and letters to the editor in
recent issues of the Davidsonian.
This is fine. The Opinions page
should allow students to say what
they feel.

However,much emouonalism
and few facts seem to be fanning
the flames of controversy. As a
public service announcement the
editors would like to presenta few
of the latter for future debate.

First on the legend of the ex-
panding calender. Professor Randy
Nelson of the English Department
serves as secretary of the Execu-
tive Council. Thisbody determines
how the academic calender will be
structured in order to encompass
fifteen weeks of classes along with
vacations, oricntauion, exams, cic.
The calender in question is for the
1992-93 academic year.

Itis a misconception, Dr. Nel-
son emphasized, that this commit-
tec can change the number of aca-
demic weeks in a semester. It is,
however, responsible for the ar-
rangement of the schedule.

Nelson stated that the current
calender “allows eighteen weeks
tocover fifteen weeks of academic
work including holidays,” etc. The
1992 - 93 calender will cover the
same fifeen weeks of class time in
seventeen actual weeks. Among
the benefits would be an extended
summer vacation which has beena
concern expressed by students
especially when sccking summer
employment.

The committee focused on
cutting the ume allotted to cxtra-
academic functions such as orien-
tation and the exam period. At the
behest of students Christmas, Fall,
and Spring breaks will remain
uncul.

To evaluate the proposed
changes in the exam period con-
sider:. in the fall of 1992 classes

will end on Friday, December 11-

Saturday is a rcading day. Exams
begin Monday, December 14 and
end Friday, the eighteenth. This
Fall classes end Monday the tenth.
. Tuesday is a reading day, exams
begin on Wednesday and end on
Wednesday the nineteenth.

Changes in the number of
academic wecks in a semester are
currently under consideration but
notby the Executive Council. Such
decisions fall under the jurisdic-
tion of the Educational Policy
Committee. The committee is cur-

rently considering the possibility

of switching to a thirteen or four-
teen week academic scmesicr
calender. Any proposal from this
committee will go to the floor fora
faculty vote.

Now onto the towing or, more
specifically, Bob Collins contro-
versy. Mr. Collins came to Davi-
son last spring after eleven years at
the Citadel and nine years as their
physical plant director. Collins is
NOT officially in charge of the
towing of illegally parked automo-

bilesonthe Davidson campus. This
is the responsibility of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety under Ray
Thrower. Collins stated that his
only contact with the situation
entailed calling Mr. Thrower ear-

“fier this ycar and saying that some-

thing had to be donc aboutillcgally
parked cars when an emergency
vehicle was unablc to get to adorm
one night because of crowded
roadways.

Collins has already demon-
strated his ability to getthings done
(and reduce the impetus for illegal
parking) by building the new park-
ing lots across from Richardson.
He has also improved the campus
lighting system.

In an interview in his office
Mr. Collins emphasized the need
for basic organizational changes in
the physical plant and facilitics

“management. This need, he ~

stressed, involves everyone from
the physical plant employces to
the administration, students, and
the fraternity houses.

Concerning the physical plant
itsclf, Collins sees too much inef-
ficiency in the management of

labor. Too many people, he feels,
are doing too little. He plans to
institute engineered jorking
schedules and time profiles giving
each cmployec a specitic arca of
responsibility. He admits that this
may cause some tensions with
workers in the near future but fecls
such actions necessary.

Further, Collins fecls that stu-
dents need to take greater respon-
sibility for their actions. Of frater-
nities he stated, “If students are
going to be in control then they
need to contol.” He wants houses
to outine more detailed arcas of
responsibility for members and
fulfill them more thoroughly. He
emphasized cleanup alter partics,
especially outdoor partics as a
particular area in need of improve-
ment. Healso feels that, because of
organizational inconsistencies,
some of the houses are not provid-
ing asanitary environment for food
service, and he feels this must
change.

Collins further admitted that
the college has not lived up to its
own administrative responsibilites
concerning the maintanence of the
houses. Some have structural
weaknesses or need new roofs and
the college has not adequatcly
addressed these issues. Collins
hopes to meet with the officers of
all the houses some time this year
to discuss all these problems and
evaluate current attitudes and ex-
pectations which he feels need
revision. ,

“I’m for democracy.” stated
Collins. “I think a democratic sys-

tcm.can work, and I’m open ‘for

suggestions. But I can be auto-
cratic if the results demand it. If I
have to I can make a decision.
That’s one thing I’m good at.”

Collins recognizes thathe may —

not be a popular man. He stated,
however, that if people think there
is a better way to get things done
they should gather up some facts
and come see him rather than rely
on second hand information.

As he put it, “I’m here to ask

the right questions.” If no one else ~

answers, Mr. Collins seems ready
to fill in the blanks.

David Scott is a junior history
major and the Opinions Editor.
