The Davidsonian

New format unveiled

BB & Billustrate IMAC pertc

By BAD BERNARD
and BONEHEAD

According to the latest
Nielsen ratings the BB&B co-
lumn has dropped precipitous-
ly, and in an attempt to
revitalize our standings we have
adopted a completely new. for-
mat. We promise that it is an
original idea, and is not plaga-
rized like most of our work in
the past.
FACES IN THE CROWD

- Pp

Turley Howard—Sopho-
more with a noted likeness to
John Belushi who bought a new
pair of blue hightop converse
Allstars and kicked a gray-
striped cat 45 yards into the

path of a parked meat grinder.

Profile Dominick—This
young freshman went to three
classes, the post office, the

library, twice to Richards .

House and four times to the
bathroom all in one day.

Tony “Tut” Langley—Led
the King Tuts to the 1978 Frosh
Flickerball championship. In
his team’s nine games this year,
“Tut’’ dropped seven passes,
fumbled twice, and told four
“Mr. Bill’

bs .
Rich Dibenedetto—This 6'7”
New Jersey native once killed a
calf with his bare hands and
then dunked its remains
through a 5-inch steel hoop at
the 1973 Bergenfield rodeo.

Mott Blair—Recently voted
“Preppiest student at Dawid-
son.” This young chemist com-
pleted his gravimetric analysis
experiment in a record overall
time of 23 hours 36 =
28,6534 seconds. ;

Bill Peeples — This 5’8”’ junior
is at best just another face in
the crowd. :

THEY SAID IT

Joan Redding, freshman
coed, on finding out her name
was in the week’s BB&B co-
lumn: ‘They don’t even know
me. Why did they mention my
name?”’

Brad Walker, former David-
son student-athlete, when
asked why he made two F’s and
a D one term last year: ‘I guess
I devoted too much time to one
subject.” :

Robert Monteith, noted Da-
vidson janitor, on how he likes
his job at Davidson: ‘‘hee, hee,
yea, ha, aah, aah, go on now.”

Boa Callcott after Captain
Cohab and Frankies’s Baby
Boas lost to McFleet:
“Chomp!”

Page Walley, senior fullback,
on setting the Davidson career

rushing record, ‘‘I never could

have done it if on all those third
and long passing situations we
hadn’t of given the football to
the fullback up the middle.”

Tom Carrington after WDAV
decided to go to 100 percent
silent music: ‘‘The students
need a sound that is conducive
to studying.”

Coach Jeff Frank, tailback
for the Old Men, on the secret to
his team’s success: ‘We rely
heavily on Geritol and Prepara-
tion H.” .

Fred Goodwin, cheerleader,
on how he got the nickname
Hardware: ‘‘I never really
thought about it. I guess I just
woke up one morning and it was
there.”

~ SCORECARD

Got the Dumps?

In a recent flickerball game,
H.S., freshman standout for the
King Tuts, provided the half-
time entertainment by doing a
squat and drop routine in the

‘nearby woods. Although he~

continyed to stink on offense in
the second half, he made one
spectacular play on defense by

catching a fart in mid-air. He
then ran past a pile of players
and in for the score to wipe

“away the opposing team’s hopes

for victory.

Heard on the Street

The Needle Dix are strong
favorites to repeat as IMAC 3
on 3 champions. . . they will
face a tough challenge from
Danny H. and Andy Mac. . .
David Jones may have one of
the top five on five hoop
teams; he picked up former Cat
cager Kirk Combe (6’5’’) and
6’3”" Rand Malone (1977 all fresh
man team). . .

Eddie Biedenbach may play
hoops with the SAEs (he was an
E at’ NC State) giving them a
stronger team than last year’s
‘squad which won the IMAC
crown. . . Vince Parker (6’6”
leaper) said today that he will
play IMAC roundball with Ke-
vin Doherty. . . Doherty has
already inked 6’1” great Bob
Lapple and 6’2” sharpshooter
Gifford Piercy. . .

Locke White, lightning quick
guard, has narrowed his choices
down to the SAE’ and McFleet.

. Dave Vaughn, 6’2”’ Phi Delt
zone buster, is still holding out,
and reportedly wants to play on
a title contender his senior year.

FEATURE

This week’s feature-article
is on the flickerball tourney,
and when the paper went to the
printers Wednesday night it
appeared that the KAs, Mac-
Fleet, the Old Men, and the
SAEs all had a good chance to
win the title.

1) KAs—Still our favorite
to win the tourney. Easilv the

most disciplined and regi- -

mented team to take the turf
this year. The Gold team makes
up in hustle what they lack in
overall talent, and their play-
book has been successful for the
past two years. The KAs rolled
over 4th Coming 52-0, in their
first game of the tourney, and
the defense did not give up a
first down. The KAs also
downed the King Tuts on
Wednesday ‘to‘make it into the
semis.

2) SAEs—This team has by
far and away the best raw talent
in the tourney, but has still not
smoothed it all out. Richards is
still hurt but will play some-
where. Wheelock has been an
adequate sub at tailback, but
lacks the experience of
Stroud, or a Frank

The E Baggers to be a
little too cocky at times, but if
they settle down and play their
game they might just carry
home the gold after a four year
drought. The Es knocked off a
tough Hurtin’ for Certin’ ball
club after a second half rally
spearheaded by Texas Pete
Johnston's beautiful intercep-
tion and score.

3) MacFleet and Stuff—The ~

big question here is “Can these
prose sit They are
just as experienced as any team

in contention, and have plenty °
of quick -talent-on hand, but —

problem seems to be they never
play enough tough games in
regular season. To win it all
MacFleet must fully exploit
Dave Shi’s talent, and probably
have some luck down the
stretch. MacFleet smashed
Cap’t Cohab, 61-12, and then
nipped the Four Skins to make
it to the semies.

4) The Old Men—The Cinde-
relly team of the final four. We

were really surprised by this’

ball club, but now they have
proven that they have as good
a chance as anyone to win the

crown. The high point in their
