K. A's And Betas |

Pace Frat Loop

By JIM FARRAR and

CHARLIE HAWKINS

K. A. 12; Sigma Chi 2
Last Thursday afternoon the
K.A,’s continued to play good hal:
by rolling over the blue-clad Sig-
ma Chis, 12 to 2, The KAs were
led by their triple-threat back, Bili
Bird, who has been the standout
on their team so far this year. Bird
scooted around end into ‘pay dirt
for the first score and heaved i
nice pass to “Stump” Asbury to
account for the second marker.
The Sema Chis put up ai nice
fight and drove the KA, back
over their goal for a safety and
their outy two points of the game.

Betas 18; SPE 0

In another encounter on Thurs-
day al.crnoon, the Betas lowered
the SI’Es by the large score of
18-0, -In this conflict the sights
of bacl Smith were in perfect line
as he tossed all three touchdowns
for the strong Betas. The gluc-
fingered Hanks was the recipient
of two of the aerials, while Jervis
latched on to the third one to end
the scoring for that day.

Phi Delt 0; SAE, 2 1st Downs

A powerful Phi Delt team lost
one of the’ best-played foptball
games of the 49 titer-Fraternity
Touch Football League to the
strong SAE. The sparkplug of the
SAL team was triple-threat back
Monty Hill, who kept the Phi Delts
in constant fear by his running,
passing, and punting. “Bilbo” Ba-
con led the Phi Delts with his bul-
let-like passing. Neither of these
two strong teams were able to push
across a marker, but the SAE boys
were able to pile up two first. downs
to none for the Phi Delts to give
them the needed margin.

Kappa Sig 6; Pi Kappa Phi 6

In what was perhaps the most
exciting game of the season, the
Kappa Sigs and Pi Kaps battled
to an absolute deadlock. However,
the outset of the game favored
the Pi Kaps all the way as they
pushed across a tally in the first
two minutes of play. The battling
Kappa Sigs were unable to do a
thing until the last forty-five
seconds when Charlie Pearson
hauled in a pass to knot up the
score. Neither team had an ad-
vantage in first downs, so the game
ended all even.

Sigma Chi 18; Campus Club 0

The second week of inter-frat
football began with Sigma Chi
overpowering the Campus Club,
18 0, Kelton was the sparkplug for
the victors, passing for two touch-
downs and running for the third.
The first touchdown came on a
Kelton to Eastman pass, the next
en an agial from Kelton to Mer-
rill. Sigma Chi continued to dis-
play the smooth offense they have
been showing so far this season.

Pikas 14; SPE 6

By virtue of the perennial fa-
vorite, the “sleeper” pass and strong
line play, the Pikas outplayed and
out-scored SPE, 14-6, .on Monday.
Jack Fanjoy scampered over with
the sleeper pass early in the game,
and Collins scored later to give
the pikas the winning margin. The

season. Bill Bird, the KA’s own

After the excitement and jubilant.
yells and screams had died down
in Charlotte and Davidson and
the moaning in Raleigh had
ceased, people began to think
seriously about the 20-14 victory
the Davidson Wildcats had taken
from the Wolfpack of N. C. State.
There were many Davidson stu-
dents who were already linking
the name of scatback Jake Wade
with that of the revered ,Peter
Stuart Ney.

This victory gave the 1949
Wildcat team several firsts. It
was the first time that a Davidson
team bad won a victory irem
a highly-touted “Rig Four” team
since 1936 and it was the first
time a Wildcat team had scored
on one of the “Big Four” teams
since 1941, It was States that the
Wildcats beat in 1936 and it was
State that Davidson scored on in
the fall of 1941. Friends of David-
son aro, and rightfully, can be
proud of their Wildcats. It is hard
for a team of boys who play be.
cause they love the game‘to win
against the boys who “play for
pay,” and that is exactly what
Davidson has heen up against when
they play against any ‘of the “Big
Four” teams.

Speaking of the “Big Four,’’ it
is high time that Davidson was
included in this “select” group and
writers again refer to it: as the
“Big Five” and not the “Big Four.’’
Davidson has held its own in all
sports with these schools, ¢xcept-
ing football and with, the victory
over State, it may be a change of

tide that will show that Davidson
with its “play for play“ boys will
Tbe able to hold its own in football
with the “play for pay” boys. Any-
way it is an indication that: David-
son will again be included in’ the
“Big Five” and no longer will it
be referred to as the “Big Four.”
lf the Wildcats cin continue to
play the brand of football they dis-
player in beating State, they
shouldi’t lose another game this
year, and could give Davidson one

Teams Are Dealt Losses By N. C. State

“By BILL BRADFORD

On Saturday morning, October
8, the Davidson Cross Country
Harriers opened their 1949 season
bv falling before a smooth ronniny
N. C. State team by the score of
16-42. In cross-country, the low
score wins. First place counts }

with each team's final seore being
determined by the © sum of the
points made by its 5 best men.

The team was badly crippled
for the meet Saturday. Blake

slowed by severe stomach cramps;

the boys reached those times

This is not to take any credit
away from the State team, for they
are well on the way to a-good sea-
son and earned their victory. The
win Saturday was their third of
the year, after an early practice
evind starting even before the of-
ficial school year began at the Ra-
institution. They seem to
have already reached their peak,
while the Red and Black squad
has yet to reach it’s peak,

Frats In Favor Of

By WOODY McKAY

Two more events have been add-
ed to the custamary events in: Da-
vidson'’s — interfraternity competi-
tion. These events are hand ball
and swimming, and are made pos-
sible by the excellent facilities of
our new fohnson Gyninastam.
Hand ball, swimming, and wrest-
ling were voted op ‘by all of the
fraternities and the Campus Club,
but wrestling was voted down by
a 6 to 5 vote; however, there may
be further consideration and anoth-
er vote on wrestling

The reason for adding these
events is because of the interest
shown by the students in anticipa-
lion of participating in these sports
which will come with the comple.
tion of the gym, and also to make
a more well rounded field of com-

The physical training will begin
instruction in hand ball, swimming,

early as November if present plans
materialize by ‘that. time. If enough
interest and skill is shown these
activities, there willbe steps taken
t@ put them into intercollegiate
competition.

The new gymnasium is supplied
with three hand ball courts located
on the fitst floor of the backside.
The new pool, expected to be of-
ficially opened on October 22, is
: of official college measurements
and is equipped with ‘u low diving
board.

Rules pertaining to the two ac-
tivities being placed in the interfra-
ternity competition will be drawn
up and presented to the students
at a later date. These additions
should. be an asset to the interfra-
ternity program, and will make pos-
sible more participation and = a
chance to discover new talent.
