F.OW. OP,

Well—is over. bo mean Junior
Speaking. Yes, that terrible bugaboo
ot the juntor’s life has been conquered,
laid in his grave, and nuiny a sermon
preached over the remains. An ine
mense sigh of mingled pain’ and relict
has gone up to the high heavens from
over three hundred manly breasts. A
sigh of rehef from that — big-handed,
shaky-kneed, quavery - voiced, self - con
scious speaker, a sigh of sweet pain
from the tortured breast of the poor
boy who has just ventured upon the
stormy sca of loves Sume ot us can
almost declare in the words of the poet:

‘But the tender yrace of a day that is
dead

Will never come back to me.

Ah, disconsolate lover, take courage. Do
you sigh in vain

... For the touch of a vanished hand

And the sound of a-voice that is still!

Vhere is a remedy for everything.
But turn your listless, love-lorn steps be-
neath the stately, wise old elms, but lis
ten to the soft Southern zephyrs as they
make love to the tender buds.above, but
look at the full orbed splendor ot the
moon, “Phen think that perhaps she,
too, is walking alone ‘thinking of you,
that this same wind which whispers to
you so. softly now has perhaps played
“ring around the roses” with a golden
curl or gently caressed the tender cor
ners of a peach-blossom cheek, that she,
too, is perhaps looking at chat same wise
old man.and telling him something that
vou would like very much to_ hear.
Think of these possibilities, my friend,
and take a little comfort unto yourself.

A DERT OF GRATITUDE,

The world owes a debt of gratitude
to Juror Speaking. Behold within three
short days the problems of ages have
been cleared up and questions that have
bothered the philosophers of every gen-
eration have been definitely decided.
Vhe whole foundation of our govern-
ment has been found wanting and means
have been discussd and apnroved* where-
by this pitiable state of affairs might be
remedied. ‘he future prosperity of our
countrv has been planned. and provided
for. The European war in all its mag-
nitude has been thoroughly analyzed. a
new map of Europe has been outlined
and the final arrangements for world
peace have been made. Oh! if Wood-
row Wilson had only attended, what
original ideas he would have received

for the management of the government,
and how delighted he would have been

to have had this load of responsibil
iv lifted from his shoulders! And i
Kaiser Wilhelm had been present, how |
his bristly imperial would have drooped
at the scathing denunciations he ‘aped
upon his head. No, gentlemen, we have
failed utterly, heretofore, in’ realizing
what a debt of gratitude this care-ridden
old world of ours owes to the Junior
who at one full swoop does away with
all its perplexities. Junior Speaking
forever!

Davivsonian Staff, and the best of

lime. “The editorial below is the second
of this series. }

‘There is one fault that we must find |
with the Davidson students; not a fault
cummon to all the students, to be sure,
but a fault common to a great many ot
them. ‘his fault is the practice ot
catdiness. Six days out of the week we
see the students coming to chapel late.
itis crue that they’ are hardly half a
minute date, nevertheless they are late,
and cause just. as much disturbance as
they would have had they been much}
ater. Many of the students who are
late for the morning prayers are ;
thuse who like to sleep late in the morn-
ings, and to speak more plainly, they
hike to sleep too well. “They wait until
the last moment to get up, and then at
this very moment, in their great hurry,
they forget that there is a limit to the
strength oof their shoe-string. “hen,
almost before they realize it, the string
is broken, they have to step ‘to tie it to-
gether, or replace it with a new one.
While they are doing this, they lose a
little time, and the last bell rings before
they are in their.seat. Some other per-
son may break a collar button, another
anay miscalculate the length of time he

needs, and the resule is chat he is late—

chapel has already begun before he is in
his seat. And again, there are the
tardies at class and church. Why it is
that the students are tardy for these is
more than we can usually understand,
but nevertheleless the professors have
this to contend with, and it is the duty
of every member of the student bedy to
help them stop this practice.

Now why should a student be on time
for chapel? ‘The whole student body is
always ready to eo when chapel is over.
‘The principle reason for this is that all
know that breakfast is waiting for them.
If any large number of students are late,
then chapel is not begun as early as it
should) be, and is therefore not over
until later than it would have been it
all had been on time. | Furthermore,
there are other things that should cause
the students to be more punctual at
chapel, at) church, and at recitations.
‘The person who comes into a room or
assembly hall where other people have
alrendy gathered always causes a dis-
turbance. “Phe attention of nearly every
person present is distracted from what
the speaker or instructor is saying. “he
one who has such a habit as this—that
of being just a few minutes late—is not
held in such high esteem by those dis-
turbed as one who is always on time is.
The habit of being tardy, viewed from
any point of view, is a bad one, In the
above 1 have had reference to unneces-
sary tardies especially; but on the other
hand, it should be remembered that all
tardies, whether unnecessary or unavoid-
able, cause the same evil consequences.
It seems to me that the students of Dav-
idson College should put forth every
every effort to be prompt in everything.
