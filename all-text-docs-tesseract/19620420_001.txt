Faculty Grants Honor Court
More Flexibility Of Power

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The faculty approved two resolutions pertaining to
the new inter-departmental humanities course and to the
Honor Court at its regular meeting April 17.

The faculty approved a reso-
lution granting the Honor Court
the privilege of recommending
that a student who has been dis-
missed for an honor offense be
allowed to apply for readmission
at the end of one year instead
of the usual two. The final de-
cision as to the acceptance of
the Honor Court’s recommenda-
tion would rest with the faculty.

Concerning the _ resolution,
Dean Burts said, “This apparent

Myers, Stowell
Win Drama Prizes

Pete Myers and Don Stowell
received awards at the 39th an-
nual State Drama Festival at-
tended by the Davidson Vaga-
bonds on April 11-14. The festi-
val,
sponsored by the Carolina Dra-
matic Association.

Myers received a distinguish-
ed acting award for his perform-
ance in the leading role in “Aria
Da Capo,” a one-act play by
Edna St. Vincent Millay. Stowell
was awarded the Hubert J. Phil-
pott Award in Theatre Arts for
his work on the set for “Picnic
on a Battlefield”, by Arrabal.

Although other plays were
performed by outstanding col-
lege, high school, and commun-
ity groups throughout Virginia
and the Carolinas, there was no
competition among plays at the
festival.

The Vagabonds were invited
to attend the state festival on
the basis of their performances
in the district festival held at
Davidson on March 23 and 24.
“Aria Da Capo” received a dis-

tinguished rating while “Picnic |)

on a Battlefield” and ‘“Lithuan-
ia” by Rupert Brooke received
excellent ratings at the district
festival.

Among the Vagabonds attend-
ing the festival were Myers,
Stowell, Neal Bushoven, Woody
Danenhower, Gene Adcock, and
Buddy Brauch. They were ac-
companied by John Sneden, di-
rector of dramatics at Davidson
and Vice President of the Caro-
lina Dramatic Association.

Wednesday night the Vaga-
bonds performed “Aria Da
Capo” and “Krapp’s Last Tape”
at Queens College. ‘“Krapp's
Last Tape,” a one-act play by
Samuel Beckett, features Smith

held in Chapel Hill, was|*

Honor Court trial in the first
semester, the Court felt that |}
the violation of the student in

as others; hence, they were re-
luctant to see the same punish- |
ment given to him as to other,
more devious offenders.
said as much to the faculty com-
mittee who heard the student's
appeal. The committee said that
it would be happy to receive
specific suggestions, with the

commended.”

STIPULATIONS ADDED
Burts said that the resolution
in no way insures that a stud-
ent who is allowed to apply for
readmission at the end of a
year would be accepted. It is
“not merely a one year suspen-
sion with assurance of readmis-
on,” he said, but that the ac-
ceptance for admission would be
made by the admission commit:
tee and executive enjoined,
“since the Honor Court cannot
foresee what the student’s con-
dition will be in a year.”
Burts added that two points
which were stressed about the
resolution were (1) that the
Honor Court must make this
recommendation at the time of
the verdict, to avoid pressure
being put on the Court by a
dismissed student appealing to

Lord. “If 1 do not find such

‘Duke, UNC:
Officials

Meet Here

Four officials from Duke}
University and University of
North Carolina graduate schools
visited Davidson Monday: after- |
noon to discuss possible David-

|son cooperation in a “three|
year MA” program at those
schools.

Dean Johnston emphasized
after his meeting with the
visitors that the discussions
held were exploratory, that
no final decisions were reach-
ed. He noted that Washington
and Lee University, Furman,
and Sweetbriar are also dis-
cussing the program with the
two graduate schools.

“The basic idea of the pro-
gram is to attract more people
to graduate school and to ex-
pedite work on their MA,”
Johnston stated. The three year
MA. program includes the last
two years of undergraduate
study and one year of graduate
school. Undergraduates now at
Duke or UNC enrolled in the
program can get graduate credit
for a few of the courses they
take as undergraduates.

“Of course, Duke and the
University of North Carolina
could not give graduate credit
for undergraduate § work
here,” Dean Johnston observ-
ed.

Although any Davidson rela-
tionship to the program is
vague at this time, Johnston
noted a few possibilities it might
include. One would be for Dav-
idson students to begin work in
one of their undergraduate
courses on a topic which they
could pursue further as a grad-
uate student. Professors from
the graduate schools could come
to Davidson to give undergrad-
uates enrolled in such a pro-
gram non-credit guidau.ce.

Another possibility would be
for students to complete their
graduate language requirement
without any study in graduate
school by passing a standardiz-
ed test. Both Duke University
and the University of North
Carolina are presently working
with the Educational Testing

ning.”

Dauntless

Dave’:

y Boy To Crusader

BY LEE KIRBY

Dave Jordan wrote his best editorials when he was angry, not loud-angry but
uiet. He sat down at the typewriter and they poured out—clear, concise, expres-

sive—good prose, good copy.
For Dave was an editor with
principles, and a newspaperman.
He could get upset over a prin-
ciple, and he could put it in
copy. The Honor Court, freedom
of the faculty, possible violation
of student elections procedure,
the honor system, the race ques-
tion, the virtual snubbing of a

visiting scholar—he could be
concerned about them all; he
was always willing to ask, “Can
Davidson Be Sincere?” And he
could get it into copy.

“Yes, it makes a differ-
ence,” he always said. THE
DAVIDSONIAN, not The Dav-
idsonian. Punctuation, spell-

ing, copy, lay-out, style—it
was all important, and Dave

knew it.

That made particularly bad
the tactic of the administration,
Public Relations, faculty, the
opposition—“Yes, boy, you
write some interesting stuff...
of course your facts are all
wrong. " This he resented
the most, this picking to dis-
credit what he wrote. This was
hardest because he is a news.
paperman at heart, a stickler for
fact and for detail. And his
facts weren't wrong—check and
see; nor were his principles—
wait and see.

He is a newspaperman and
a@ true Davidsonian. And he
knows the importance of THE
DAVIDSONIAN. He gave it
four years of devoted ef-
fort—“ THE DAVIDSONIAN
always comes first... “

American publication.

On a campus outstanding for
its apathy, he gave full time to

VOTING TIME CUT

The voting which usually ‘runs
throughout the morning, will be
limited to a brief period immed-
iately following chapel. “The
Student Council has decided to
initiate this shorter period of
voting in an effort to get more
people to vote,” stated Council
President Danny ‘Carrell.

“We feel that the shorter per-
iod of voting as well as this
particular placement of the time
will encourage an increase in
voting. In the past students
either didn't know that elec-
tions were in progress or they
kept putting-off voting during
the morning until it was too
late.”

QUALIFICATIONS CITED

Both nominees for Scripts ‘n
Pranks are members of Sigma
Upsilon national honorary
creative writing fraternity.
Ackerman is a history major
from Louisville, Ky. He is a
member of Sigma Nu fraternity
and Eumanean Literary Society

THE DAVIDSONIAN and
Scripts ‘n Pranks for the past
two years. Last’ year he was
editor of the honoraries section

of Quips and Cranks.

Halyburton is an _ English
major and member of Phi Gam-
ma Delta fraternity. He is a
member of Philanthropic Lit-
erary Society and participates in
both track and wrestling. Haly-
burton has had poetry publish:
ed in The National Anthology.

The Head Cheerleader for
next year will be selected by

the year the APO’s have run
errands for students in the in-
firmary, conducted tours of the
campus, and ushered at con-
certs and other events.

Two college-connected _pro-
jects have been the publishing
of a student directory and work

. this magazine does not pretend to be a cheap

imitation of Playboy. The slicker, more intensive edition |

that magazine in his inner sanctum of higher —.

But not only has the quality
of our magazine declined ap-
preciably in recent years, the
student body has never taken
full advantage of its possibili-
ties.

Scripts ‘n Pranks is one of the
few student publications in the
nation that is not censored in
any way until after it has been
issued. Moreover, the college
exerts no direct control of any
form over it. We have great
freedom to say what we want, in
as sharp terms as we wish, on
any particular aspect.of the
school, the faculty, the adminis-
tration, or even ourselves.

In the past, the contents of
the magazine have swung
from the purely literary to

| the purely satirical. The best

issues have achieved a happy
medium, combining cartoons,
jokes, parody and satire with
more serious poems and short
stories.

And yet there have been many
problems. The reputation of
poor quality has prevented stud-
ent interest and support which
is neeessary to raise the quality.
Finances have not allowed the
extra touches that could make
the magazine more attractive.
Circulation has been confined
to the college, creating an in-
cestuous situation in which out-
side criticism is not readily felt.
Editors have never put in the
effort that the editors of the
newspaper and the annual ex-

pend.

This can be changed. The
new magazine advisory board
will give the editor increased
support and will. assure that
the job is being done. Finan-
cial health can be restored
by selling copies at other
schools, and by an earnest
campaign for subscriptions
and advertising.

The editor must work at his
job the whole year round. Is-
sues that are assembled at the
last minute cannot be anything
but shoddy. The editor . must
fight to raise the quality of
content and layout.

These things I vow to do.
There is enough to be said, and
enough good talent to say it to
fill more than the three issues.
My staff would be open to all
who will be willing to work.

In order for Scripts ‘n Pranks
to regain its position of respect
among college publications and
to become’ a sought-after med-
ium of ‘real creative talent, it
will need an editor who is not
only willing and anxious to work
hard at the actual editing and
layout, but one who. will also
Stimulate and seek out the best
that the Davidson student can
produce.

If I am elected editor of
Scripts ‘n Pranks, I will be this
type of editor.

1 do not propose to let the
magazine become unbalanced
in its contents. It will be a
blend of humorous and ser-
ious types of both literature
and art. Emphasis will be
placed on experimentation
and new ideas. It will not be-
come stagnant and repetitious,
and each issve will contain a
wide variety of entertaining
and quality material.

Humor will be a very import-
ant part of the magazine, but
since this aspect of it has been
somewhat controversial of late,
I make it perfectly clear that
the humor published will not
be of the “bathroom wall” var-
iety.

Material will be welcome
for consideration from any
group or individual in the
student body and | will re-
main unbiased in my judg-
ment of these manuscripts.

In brief, my every effort will
be to make Scripts ‘n Pranks
not only the best Davidson Col-
lege student publication, but to
make it the best humor and lit-
erary magazine amony Southern
colleges.

This, with your cooperation,
can be done.

Army Liberalizes
Grad Study Policy

The Department of the Army
has rescinded its policy of limit-
ing the delays in call to active
} duty for ROTC graduates. The
| initial policy was outlined in the
March 2 issue of the DAVID-
SONIAN.

Under the provisions of the
policy, a delay in call to active
service is now reasonably as-
sured for MS IV’s in all ‘fields
of graduate study. Thus an MS
IV planning graduate study in
any field can probably be grant-
ed a delay.

Any ROTC graduate who has
previously been denied initial
delay has until May 1 to re-
submit his application. Persons
who have already received a
delay need not reapply under
the newest system.

Any MS IV student who de-
sires to reapply should report
to the ROTC Orderly Room for
more information.

tion will be the Male Chorus,
