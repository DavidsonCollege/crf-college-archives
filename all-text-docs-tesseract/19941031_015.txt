first team to defeat the Mountain-
eers at home this season. ‘We
could have given up after they
scored the first goal complaining
that we weren’t used to playing on
turf,” said Coach Hundley, “but the
girls stuck it out.” Junior Heather
Wineberg pulled a hat trick scor-
ing all three of her teams goals.
Sunday’s game opened up
with a goal in the first 27 seconds
by senior Ellen Sprinkle who set
the precedent for the rest of the
game. Upby three at half-time, the
Wildcats didn’t let up. The ball
stayed in the opponents half of the
field most of the second half with
the Paladins getting only two shots
on goal. In a 6-0 shutout victory,
Sprinkle, Claudia Lombard, Jodie

Lewis, Amy Kanoff, LauraChavis,.

and Amy Lindstrom all scored.
Kanoff, Lombard, and Sprinkle
also racked up one assist a piece.

Beginning the season one and
seven, the team has come on strong
to win five of its last six games. As
the team grew healthier, the ball
started to bounce in their direction
and the offense converted goals
that it had not been able score on in
earlier games. “What I am most
proud of is that we sorted out the
problems we were having and the
girls continued to work hard; they
never quit,” says Coach Hundley.
“The slow start and especially the
initial loss to Furman caused me to
grow as a coach, and I believe we
grew as a team.”

By winning on Sunday, the
team not only avenged a loss, but
they maintained their four year
record of winning the senior’s last
home game. This is the first year
the Southern Conference will hold
awomen’s conference tournament.
Only four teams will represent the
conference. Davidson faces Ap-
palachian State in the first round in
Greensboro at 11:00 on Saturday,
November 5. Furman faces Geor-
gia Southern that afternoon. The
championship game will played at
1:30 on Sunday.

The team was ranked pre-

season champions and have been
expected to win their conference
games all season. “We just need to
remain confident and maintain the
work ethic we have had all season
when we go into these tournament
games,”said Kanoff. Sprinkle
agrees: ‘We have really come
together and are now fulfilling our
potential. If we continue to play
confidently, we should come out
ahead in the tournament.”

Sweeney time of 4:45.01 in
the 400 IM would have been good
enough to eclipse the school record
of 5:00.92 had she not reset the
record the evening before with a
