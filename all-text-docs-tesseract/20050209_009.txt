yokstore pricing glitch

leaves students overcharged

In a statement released yesterday, the
Davidson College Campus Bookstore
announced that a pricing glitch has been
affecting all advertised prices for the
past five years.

According to Bookstore manager Joy
Adams, an uncorrected coding
problem related to the Y2K bug
led to the prices being round up
to the next highest prime inte-
ger.

Adams explained the dilem-
ma. “I guess we forgot to update
the software for Y2K, so when
the year switched, our comput-
ers crashed. As part of its auto-

_Matic price-protection feature,
the pricing software tried to
automatically reconfigure the
pricing matrix. Unfortunately,
there was a minor bug in the
softweare. According to our
estimates, the average price of
most items was raised about

The continued ‘sales were a surprise
to the Campus Bookstore leadership.
The pricing glitch had turned from a
major crisis into a major increase in
profits.

Student reaction to this news has

Macintyre ’07, “My dad gives me a
thousand bucks every year on my Cat
Card. It’s not like if I don’t spend the
money, I'll get it. So, I figure that I might
as well spend it wantonly in the campus
bookstore. I’ve already
bought a Davidson watch, a
Davidson rug, a Davidson
chair for my desk, multiple
Davidson Christmas orna-
_Mments, a Davidson golf set, a
lithograph of old Chambers,
a Davidson silver necklace,
and a Davidson wine glass
set. Also, whenever I walk
into the bookstore, I buy two
or three grab bags.”
Members of the adminis-
tration, while apologetic, do
not expect to refund the
money that students were
overcharged. Explained
Dean of Students Michael
Altiere, “We do feel bad that

twenty to twenty-five percent.” Students were overcharged an average of 25 percent for many students, parents, and

Oddly enough, Bookstore
sales have been mostly unaf-
fected by the mistaken price increase,
and in-fact, have even increased.

Said Adams, “We couldn’t have possi-
bly guessed that anything had hap-
pened. Nobody complained about the
increased costs of items, and the stu-
dents were still buying the merchandise,
obviously unaffected by the higher
prices.”

“I was amazed that no one noticed
they were paying two dollars for one
pencil,” she declared, “or 20 bucks for a
DVD. It’s not like they couldn’t go to
Wal Mart and get the same DVD for half
the price.”

Davidson College themed items such as this sweatshirt

been relatively minimal, with many stu-
dents reporting not to have noticed the
increased prices, and most students
claiming indifference.

Sarah Nelson ’08, when asked her
opinion, said, “I don’t really mind pay-
ing the high prices. As long as my
father’s credit card is not rejected, I
could not care less what the bookstore
charges.”

Furthermore, many students report
that they would gladly pay higher prices,
in exchange for convenience, and the
fact that many parents pay for the
charges on Cat Cards. Said Percy

friends of the College were
overcharged for their pur-
chases. But, they still chose to buy items,
even when faced with theinflated prices.
They clearly valued the goods at the
higher price. And, it’s not as if the
money isn’t going to Davidson for stu-
dents’ benefits. To be honest, I doubt
that we would have been able to afford
all of these great new athletic fields if the
Bookstore prices were never raised.”

Others, though, feel cheated. Said
Michael Williams ’07, “Now I really wish
I hadn’t bought eight of those Davidson
Swimming shirts at the inflated prices. I
mean, I don’t even know anyone on the
Swim Team.”

You wanna try filming a “documentary” here?

REX HoLLoway
CEO Cuicks GONE CRAZEE INC.

It pains me to say that my recent visit
to your campus was nothing short of
disappointing. Last weekend I came to
Davidson with my camera crew in hopes
of getting footage for my College Chicks
Gone Crazee: Liberal Arts Ladies DVD
set to release this summer.

We showed up to “Self-Selection
night” last Friday with high expecta-
tions. If I wanted film of guys running
around in jock straps, I would have gone
to a football game or something. I’ve
never been to a party where I had to’
pass out shirts to the guys in hopes that
they would put clothes back on. What’s
next, a Richard Simmons: Sweatin’ to
the Oldies night? Everyone dress up in
your favorite sequin tank top and three
inch long pair of shorts. I’m sure that
would be real entertaining. Or not.

This experience reminds me of the

_last time I came to Davidson, after I
heard about something called “Ladies
Night.” I should sue those bastards for
false advertising. There was no night of
ladies, it was just a sausage fest. What

the hell is that?

Just this week, we came to Davidson
to try filiming at Turner Eating House
for their Mardi Gras Party. Now, I
thought, this has some serious potential.
Where else is their more female nudity
than at Mardi Gras? Surely, this couldn’t
possibly be ruined too. I showed up,
cheap sets of beads in my left hand and
a camera to record all the hot, collegiate,
female nudity I would be seeing that
night in my right hand. But, I hadn’t
counted on what I call the “Davidson
College Factor,” an absolute lack of
female nudity.

Once again Davidson, you failed me.
The only girl-on-girl action I saw was
two girls hugging because they were so
excited that Madonna’s “Like a Prayer”
was being played for the seventh time
that night. The only boob I saw was,
well, nothing at all. Where was the large
mob of horny dudes chanting “Show
your boobs!”? Where were the half-
naked girls dancing around? Where
were the drunken lesbian experiences
that I was supposed to capture on my
video camera and sell for millions of
dollars to many different people?

Davidson College, you disappointed
me and you disappointed the American
public.

What is wrong with Davidson girls?
Do you think that you’re too good to be
exploited for a T-shirt or some plastic
beads or something? These are sup-
posed to be the years that you do regret-
table things like get naked on film that is
mass marketed and sold across the
country. The guys understand this
because they are the ones getting naked
at the parties.

And guys, what the heck’s wrong with

you? These girls have potential. If you
guys knew how to sweet talk therfi, then
you wouldn’t be so bored that you'd
need to run around naked. Let me tell

“| could have
made a killing at
Davidson if peo-

ple were into

buying film of
sweaty, hairy,
naked guys”

you something, if I were at Davidson,
we'd be having strip poker games every
night. The Mardis Gras party would fea-
ture one thing: naked chicks. And ladies
night? Ha! We’d have stripper night
every night at my Frat.

I could have made a killing at
Davidson if people were into buying film
of naked, sweaty, hairy guys. Too bad no
one wants to see that. This crap won't
sell; it’s not even worth a 4am infomer-
cial on UPN. I am debating whether to
file a lawsuit over lost money spent on
film, travel expenses, and the emotional
trauma suffered from seeing so many
naked guys at parties. I'll give a call to
that guy over at College Males Gone
Mad. He'll love your parties. I know I
sure as heck didn’t.

Campus SPOTLIGHT:

viseeeaacuned sation

campus, living in what was formerly the

feirrerctcingsn Pete oh. rte
, Upon returning to

Pp
for RLO. kai athe loss of their com-
mon. space, the rest of ist Sentelle
demanded that they maintain a lounge
of some kind, and the only solution
available to their residential advisor,
according to him, was to continue using
the former lounge as their. lounge and
just try to work around the schedules of
the two residents.
RA Greg Kristofferson '07 explained,

“The hall had really gotten used to that
space as a place.for their relaxation and
bonding. I mean, isn’t that what college
is supposed to be about? Besides, with
Justin and Tim having been gone all fall,
I figured they would appreciate the

chance to get to know their hallmates _

better.”

Summers and Peterson do not share
their residential advisor’s sentiments. “I
don’t see how having the entire hall
invade our room whenever they want is
supposed to be a positive thing,”
Summers said.

Hallmate Josey Maclvers ‘06 dis-
agreed. “I would never have even talked
to Justin and Tim if we weren't still
using the lounge. I’m pre-med, I don’t
have much time to socialize and I prob-
ably would’ve just said hi to each of
them and then gone on with my day.”

Cameron Shannon ’05 said, “I think |

it’s a great idea. What better way for
these two to get back into the Davidson
routine than by having all the hall
events be in their own room? When |

Kristofferson to allow the roommates to
lock the door from 2:00 AM to5:00 AM;
otherwise the room is to be open for use
all day.

“I have to work my homework sched-
ule around everyone’s TV times. If 1

need to do some French before class, I

have to be finished before Regis and
Kelly come on. If I want to get some his-
tory reading done before dinner, I have
to wait until Seinfeld is over. And if The
OC is on, forget it, 1 might as well just
leave,” said Meadows.

Peterson agreed that the room can be
a hassle at times. “I haven't gotten used
to being able to fall asleep while a group
of people are watching CSI: New York in
my room. I'just can’t feel.comfortable in
my own room. The worst was when a
group.of guys held a poker tournament
in my room until two, and then some
girl woke me up at six in the’ morning
because she was watching ‘Good Day
America.”

Kristofferson claimed to be looking
into alternate options, including an out-
door lounge, or perhaps rotating the
lounge through each residential room
on a weekly basis. Both roommates,
however, insist on maintaining their
complaints until something is done to
rectify what both see as a major prob-
lem. : re

Homeless man found living in

old Kappa Sigma House

When Turner Eating House moved
across the street to “Club Zodiac” to free
up the Turner house for a semester of
renovations, not only did they gain a
basement, they gained a friend.

During their inaugural party at the
old Kappa Sigma house, a surprise guest
greeted the women of Turner. Living in
the bar was Bud Hotchkiss, 42, a cur-
rently .unemployed native of
Mooresville, NC. When two Turner jun-
iors ventured downstairs, they discov-
ered a sleeping Hotchkiss in the far cor-
ner. Hotchkiss stirred when the girls
began loading the refrigerator. Needless
to say, all parties were stunned.

“When PIKA moved out last year, the
social chair told me I wouldn’t have to
help clean up anymore, because they
would have a new house, and I wouldn’t
have to commute. I know PIKA and
Turner don’t do much together, but I am
hoping [Turner President] Lisa Croupp
will honor that commitment,” said Bud.

Indeed, Bud explained that after the
PIKA’s discovered his janitorial experi-
ence, they traded bar space in exchange
for Bud’s help in weekly house cleaning.
“The pledges still had to do the [toilet]
work, but I was coerced into a substan-
tial portion of the cleaning,” Bud
explained.

Bud has called the old Kappa Sig
house “home” for more than a year. He
was born in Mooresville, NC, and after
graduating from Mooresville High
School held jobs at both Chik-fil-a and
Vinnie’s. After quite a few taxing weeks,
Hotchkiss decided to call it quits. For
good.

“It just wasn’t the life for me—all that
stress and time devoted to pleasing
other people,” Hotchkiss said, “I decid-
ed to live out on my own. When I read
that Kappa Sig was thrown off campus
because of the whole goose thing, I fig-
ured that would mean that a house
would be unoccupied. Unfortunately, it
wasn’t as big as I imagined, but it’s fine
down in the basement for just me. I’ve
been doing great here, and I’ve really
turned it into a little home with posters
and everything. I live quite well, and eat
nicely from the leftovers of the houses
thrown out on Sundays.”

Some Turner members could not be
happier with Bud’s decision. While the
Turner girls were not expecting a new
“member” from the move, the house’s
administration is still considering
whether or not to contact authorities.
“He’s aclean, nice, helpful guy and we’re
happy to have him around.” replied
Turner house manager Jade Rain ’07.
