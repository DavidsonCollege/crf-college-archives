A Howling Success

Danielle Howle mesmerized Outpost with musical talent

By Katie HALL
Guest Writer

This Thursday, Danielle
Howle blessed the Jumpin’ Java
coffee house with a beautiful mu-
sical experience. An energetic
pixie, Danielle guzzled “naive”
water and told life stories of a
tormented, yet bemused Southern
woman. Hersongs weaved tales of
rednecks, grandma’s cooking,
rusty Camaros, trailer love, and
childhood enemies. There wasn’t
a single seat left in the Union Out-
post, but that didn’t keep listeners
from crowding along the walls and
squatting on the floor. Without
‘any lights.for effects or her regular
back-up band, Danielle mesmer-
ized onlookers with a 90 minute
set of powerful and deeply per-
sonal tunes. Citing Hank Williams
Sr. and the Melvins as her primary

influences, Danielle has created
herowneclectic style which ranges
from Folk to Punk. Do not be
confused, Danielle is not one
caught between the rebellious
worlds of the hippies or the
hardcore. Taking in whatever ele-
ments she chooses her own,
Danielle is an innovative and witty
minstrel, who should not be over-
looked.

Originally from a small town
‘outside of Rock Hill, Danielle has
played her own songs since her
high school days. Since gradua-
tion, she has become a shining star
in the Charlotte and Columbia
music scenes within the past few
years. Formerly in Lay Quiet
Awhile, Danielle now works full-
time with the newly formed group,
the Rugrats. According to Eric
Christensen and Penny Craver, pro-
prietors of the Tremont Music Hall,

“Danielle is the most sensational
musician in the South.”

The Rugrats received top bill-
ing at the Southern Music Show-
case and they soon will be record-

‘ing anew album with Simple Ma-

chines, an independent Arlington
label. Danielle released her very
first full-length album with the help
of the Educational Services at USC,
Live at McKissick Museum, just
this year.

She sold many copies of her
CD to newly found fans at
Davidson. Surrounded by admir-
ers wanting autographs and bits of
homegrown wisdom, Danielle
flushed at the well deserved atten-
tion.

“This is one of the things I like
todo. Actually, it’s my very favor-
ite,” she said. "Thanks so much for
letting me share this part of me
with you.” Thank you, Danielle.

Slow Boat to China:

By DEAVER TRAYWICK
& MEREDITH STRONG
Guess Writers

Surprise, excitement, shock,
anticipation: all these words and

* more could be used to describe our

reactions to Beijing. By the time
we eleven, including Gill “Old

Tyger” Holland, graduate from
Capital Normal University Col-

lege of Foreign Languages in De-
cember, we will have worn out
those words and many others.

- A few of us were immediately
surprised upon arrival to find that
we had been outfitted with Chi-
nese roommates to make our stay
more enriching. However, it was

no sooner than Katy Saldarini had
met her roommate Xanadra, John
Spainhour met Jackie, and Chris
Williams met Xia Lei, a.k.a. Grant
Hill, that they were sold on their
new Chinese friends.

Most of us live in a “Melrose
Place’”’-style courtyard (sans pool
and toilets) where we are frequently
subjected to blaring renditions of
the Beatles, Air Supply, Michael
Jackson, and the Everly Brothers.

So far Randall Lee has been
the only Davidson representative
to successfully challenge a Chi-
nese student in their favorite pas-
time, ping-pong. Apart from Spen-
cer Sword’s beef lung and John’s
broiled scorpion, the food has been

Students ex

excellent. Eating rice three tomes
a day has made us all chopstick
experts.

Some of us have taken full
advantage of ubiquitous Beijing
Five Star beer (twenty-five ounces,
twenty-five cents), while others
spend the weekends exploring dis-
cos such as Nightman, where Katy,
Meredith Strong, and Gill Holland.
Jr. (anunexpected visitor) appeared
on a big-screen television to rave
reviews.

Michael Wang fills us in on
the box scores after watching CNN
from the hot tub at the Shangri-La
Hotel. Brian Parrish, on the other
hand, has become the lead singer
for a chinese band, while Juli

cy has landed a job teaching
English here at the college. You,
too, can easily do both teach and
take classes here in Beijing.

Within a week of our arrival,
we had all purchased new thirty-
dollar Flying Pigeon bicycles, an
essential commodity in this city of
millions of bikes. Bicycle and
automobile traffic simultaneously
is controlled by a uniformed of-
ficer on a pedestal in the center of
every intersection. Nonetheless,
Spencer was unable to avoid ahead-
on collision with a Chinese cyclist
during rush hour.

We are in Beijing this fall,
along with sixty other Americans,
primarily tolearn Chinese language

erience the Orient

and literature, but ourclasses don’t
end there.

‘Many of us are becoming quite
skilled in Chinese cooking, paint-
ing, and Tai Chi. (We are also
becoming fine interpreters of En-
glish language signs which read,
“Please, no smocking in the build-
ing,” or “Please do not urinate on
the monuments,” or even “In case
of fire, ejaculate the building.”’)

If you are planning on study-
ing abroad, know that if youchoose
a third-world country there will be
many demanding obstacles to over-
come. However, ten of your class-
mates and one “Old Tyger” are
proof that adjustment is difficult
but entirely rewarding.

praising the diminutive Milling and
his fellow artists. Davidson’s di-
rector of news & photography Bill
Giduz boasted, “I do some of my
best work in the dark,” and went on
to prove it, demonstrating his dark-
roomskills by spooling film witha
Dover’s grocery bag on his head,
then juggling, all the while manag-
ing not to fall off the stage.
Someone at intermission made
the mistake of loaning M.C. Gor-

professor/ singer/ guitarist John
Wertheimer came to her rescue
with his hilarious “La Di, Da Di
(Kill Them Bugs)”, a hymn to “‘in-
sect infestation” somewhat in line
with the Habitat House theme, and
his modern-day “Silent Night.”
Geordie Schimmel regretted
not indulging in a pre-recitation
drink a la John Montague; still the
junior poet’s voice rendered hand-
somely such dense and rhythmic
poems as his “‘Quotidia of a Quail.”
Lee Burnett, “that bagpipe guy,”
‘paraded about in a kilt playing a
medley of traditional tunes on his
renowned Scottish instrument.

“Rags I Bear’ was Ravi Jain’s en-
ergetic song of cleansing the “so-
lemnity of my mistakes,” and
Davidson chaplin Rob Spach fol-
lowed with a reading of the natural
poetry of Mary Oliver. Conclud-
ing was a vibrant “They Might be
Giants” ditty covered by Moxie —
guitarists James and Nathan and
cellist Angela, the only Davidson
students (besides Fernando) of first
name fame.

The grandest finale was the
fact these talented Davidson folks
in the Variety Show helped to raise
almost $250 dollars for Davidson’s
Habitat House crusade.

allusions contained in the film.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind,
The Shining, Star Trek, The Lion

_ King, and a score of other movies

have various homages devoted to
them planted in the film.

The voices of the various toys
are also well-done. Tom Hanks
continues his streak of hit movies
with an affecting turn as Woody.
Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz, is a

more than worthy counterpart to

Hanks. The supporting cast per-
forms impeccably, lead by Don
Rickles’ turn as Mr. Potato Head.

Before I saw this movie for
the first time I saw a preview for
Disney’s next animated film, The
Hunchback of Notre Dame, and
thought that it was going to be an
astonishing film. When I saw the
preview for Hunchbackthe second
time, however, I couldn’t help but
think how primitive it looked next
to Toy Story. At that point I real-
ized that Toy Story may be the first
film of its kind, but it most defi-
nitely not the last. I have seen the

- future of the animated film, and its

a fantastic sight. (A+)

been a sissy without Johnny Cash.”

My personal favorite is a song
called “Slug” that floats along ona
smooth synth and simple -piano
riff. Bono’s voice, as in many of
‘the songs, is kept low in his regis-
ter giving him an almost lounge act
quality. “Don’t want to over dress/
Den’t want to make a mess/Don’t
want you to confess/I’m not under
duress/Don’t want to be untrue/I
want be with you.”

Like Zooropa, Original
Soundtracks 1 is aconglomeration

of track upon track of sound, The
difference is inZooropa’s overrid-
ing song structure and guitar work
which offers a certain familiarity
to the music and holds the songs
together by giving the listener a
repeated phrase to latch onto.
Original Soundtracks 1 puts the
synthesizer out front and hides the
guitarin the haze, achieving amuch
different effect.

So take this as a warning: un-
less you are adie- hard fan, the new
album probably won’ tinspire more
than disappointed grumblings. On
the other hand, if you’re looking
for something different from a
group that has a pretty solid repu-
tation, this might be listening bliss.
