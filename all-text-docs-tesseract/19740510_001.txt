On May 3 the Board of
Trustees met for the last time
this year. The most important
item at the meeting was a
presentation by Walter F.
Lingle, chairman of the gover-
nance committee, to the draft
of the proposed college con-
stitution and the dicision after
the presentation to put this on
the agenda for consideration
at the next trustee meeting in
October.

The religious policy and
program committee presen-
ted the recommendation that
the trustees give vigorous sup-
port to Davidson’s effort in the
Presbyterian synod to
promote understanding of the
vital importance of Christian
higher education in the
church.

No action. was taken on the
tenure debate, and _ the
question is. still under con-
sideration in the executive
committee of the trustees to
which it has been referred by
the board.

College President Samuel
Spencer Jr. gave the annual
Report of the President. In-
cluded in the report were sum-
maries of the admissions
situation, the college’s finan-
cial status, and academic life.

The statement said, ‘‘We
have had a good year. At a
time when serious problems
beset colleges and universities
across the country, it is
gratifying to be able to report
an upsurge of applications for

admission, a substantial in-
crease in the resouces of the
college, and an apparent
enhancement of Davidson's

. reputation.’’

Among the many issues that
were discussed in the report,
the following were important:
the inflation rate and its effect
on the college, the tenure
situation, the current threats
to academic freedom in the
United States, the status of
coeducation at Davidson, the
Rocky River project, the need
for new computer terminals,
and the projected housing
units.

There were also many

promotions. Associate
Professor of Education
William H. Hight was

promoted to a full professor-
ship. Assistant Professor of
Biology David C. Grant was
promoted to the rank of
associate professor. In-
structor of Music Robert E.
Jackson was promoted to the

Spencer Outlines Issues For Trustees

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

(Ed Note: In his Report to
the Trustees of Davidson
College, President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. outlined several
important matters about
which he thought the Trustees
should be informed and con-
cerned. As we depart for the
summer some of these same
issues are worth our own
thought.)

The first of these concerns is
for ‘‘the preservation of
quality and high standards in
the midst of the ferment and
proliferation of options
growing out of the changes of
the last decade.

“Another is the concern for
liberal learning as contrasted
with purely pre-professional

training, especially in an era
when more than half of our

students go from Davidson to
graduate school.

“A third is the tendency
toward a new provincialism
caused by disillusionment
with the Vietnam wer and a
movement toward the
neoisolationism against which
Dean Rusk has warned us.”’

As Davidson wrestles with

the problem of self-isolation
and the paradox of a liberal
arts versus a pre-graduate
school education, it will
simultaneously have to con-
front a galloping inflation and
its attending implications for
Davidson.

This year, in accordance
with a suggestion coming out
of the Finance Committee, the
college gave every individual
on the payroll an increase of 9
percent of the first $6,000 of
wages or salary, with a
modest amount reserved for
merit increases beyond that
sum.

Although the payroll is the
largest item in the budget by
far, the increases, for the most
part, did little more than keep
salaries even with the rise in
living costs, if that.

Spencer said, ‘‘Having built
into the budget more than half
a million dollars additional
money for salary and wage in-
creases over a two year
period, it is almost inevitable
that we will have to increase
tuition beginning in 1975-76.

“This contributes to a fur-
ther widening of the gap bet-
ween independent college

costs and those of the state
universities, a matter of con-
cern to all of us in the in-
dependent sector lest this give
further impetus to the loss of
students to the state system.”
Spencer went on to say that
one partial solution to the
problem lies in broader fun-
ding of state and federal
scholarship programs.
Another consideration is the
possibility of leveling off the
student body at a population
of 1350 to 1400. Year around
operation is a related subject
for possible implementation.
In his report the President
was also concerned with
threats to academic freedom.
“One is the federal govern-

‘“‘an open forum where ideas
can be expressed without fear
of reprisal."’

In the world of scholastic,
Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan
described this year in terms of
self-study. The Southern
Association of Colleges and
Schools requires such a study
every ten years. However, ac-
cording to Bevan, ‘the ad-
ministrators of the college feel
obliged to recommend to the
Southern Association a change
in format for such studies
because of the time and
energy expended in such an ef-
fi vee

He noted that at present, 12
committees on Standards
meet weekly, departments
meet on a similar schedule to
consider the ramifications for

In addition to self-study,
Bevan explained the ob-
jectives of the Rocky River

Project of the Center for
Honors Study. He called the
project ‘‘an interdisciplinary
study including the _in-
vestigation of the biological,
chemical, social, and political
aspects of the river.”

The project is funded by
various national foundations
and government agencies. —

Pointing out the intensified
scholarly activity of the
faculty and staff, Bevan
revealed that 40 percent of the
Davidson College faculty
presented papers at

professional meetings or
authored papers in journals
this year. Fifty-two percent
attended regional national, or
international meetings of their

profession.
