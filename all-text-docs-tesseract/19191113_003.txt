It is a common sight now-a-days to
see a line of street cars standing still,
“waiting for power.” The like is often
seen in church life. Many churches are
marking time, waiting for power. They
need, above all things, a strong connec-
tion with the dynamo of God.— Method-
ist Protestant.

Dr. Price Addresses “Y” on
“The Lure of : the East”

‘The Bigness of the Job Makes It
the

ttractive — China
Coming Nation
|

—_———9

The student body was fortunate
enough to have the opportunity of hear-
ing Dr. F. P. Price again Tuesday even-
ing at the “Y” service. Dr. Price is one
of the most prominent Christian workers
in the far East today. He holds the
chair of Theology in the Theological
Seminary at Nan Kiang. He is one of
the bese informed men on the Chinese
question and gave a very impressive talk
on the conditions as they exist there to-
day. \
As the theme of his discussion he
chose ‘The Lure of the East.” By res
lating experiences he showed that the
East offered a call of adventure. Many
people who go to China intending to stay
only a year often become so interested
in the work that they stay there a life-
time. Aside from opportunities for
Christian service China has many chances
for business enterprise. '

From another viewpoint China has
its drawbacks. To learn the language
alone requires years’ study on account of
the many characters the alphabet con-
tains. Dr, Price related a number of
amusing incidents which Americans have
had in attempting to talk to the natives.

By going into China in any one of the
many ways of Christian service one does
a great deal toward building up the char-
acter of the Chinese people. It means
the recons:ruction of a nation. The
Chinese are not a backward _ people.
Were China only given a chance she
would stand among the greatest nations,

China looks to America alone for
frieridship. It is America’s duty to ex-
tend it. The East does not understand
the West. By the power of God and
under the shadow of the cross the rwo
may be bound together. Lt is a big job
and it calls for big men. Finally, it de-
inands the ambition 10 do big things and
the willingness to make sacrifices.

Caldwell, Although Handicapped
by Distance, Ranks Among
the Best Sunday Schools

Every man interested in the Sunday
School work of the Y. M. C. A. will
say, if interviewed, that his school is the
best. The six or eight fellows who go
down to Caldwell are no exception to
‘this, for they are very much interested
,and scem to be doing a fine work.

For a number of the years this work
-has been carried on in the Caldwell .
‘school building. However, the fact that
they have no building of their own is no
hindrance to Davidson pep, as is clearly
shown by the fellows who walk the cight
miles down there every Sunday.

Superintendent Cassel teaches a Men’s

The fadies also have a class in which
Askew is doing a good work. The
‘younger members of the school are di-
vided into suitable classes under com-
pttegt teachers from here. In fact the
whcle work is carried on through the ef-
forts of these men. :

The outstanding feature of Caldwell
Sunday Schcol is its music. With the
aid of a good organ, a number of good
singers and plenty of enthusiasm, the
singing does credit to all concerned.

Regardless of the handicaps of dis-
tance and location, it is only two miles
from Huntersville, they have as their
aim an attendance of 100. The present '
attendance is about seventy-five or
cighty. In order to obtain this goal a
number of plans for arousing and main-
taining interest have been devised. One
of these is to have outside speakers to
meke talks or preach for them. Accord-
ing to the attendance records this has
agate n done in vain, for the number

large. ;

MINISTERIAL AND VOL-
UNTEER BANDS HEAR
TALK ON THE
ORIENT.

A joint meeting of the Ministerial and
Volunteer Bands was held Sunday after-
noon. Dr. Price of China, one of the
leading missionaries in the Southern ,
Presbyterian church, made an interest- !
ing talk to the large number of men pres-
ent, on the subject, “The Open Door of
the Orient.” ‘

Dr. Price made a talk of interest to
everyone present by putting it in the
light of being a privilege as well as a
heroic work for a man to do God's work
in these Eastern countries. The latter |
point he illustrated by showing the hard- |
ships and the handicaps under which mis- |
sionaries labor in Korea because of the ;
power which the Japanese officials ”

over this weaker country,

Dr. Priee furthermore showed the
work waiting to be done in the great
field of China, which for centuries lias ,
been closed to Americans and all foreign-
ers, but which is open wide to receive the
