(Sm coor {In Final Conference Tan

You’re always encountering talk around here about
the need for increased subsidization of football and
basketball, and the benefit which good teams in these
sports could accrue to Davidson College.

But why should it be the major sports that
receive all the financial attention? Why should
tennis, swimming, wrestling, golf and track not
be allotted somo of this present financial aid,
plus a portion of whatever future subsidization
may be tendered the Wildcat athletic depart-
ment?

A few short years ago Davidson reigned over South-
ern Conference tennis, and it appears that “Little
Richard” may be singing the number one tune again very
soon. Every now and then the Davidson tankmen come
up with a “great” swimmer, as Davidson swimmers go.
Ditto for the track team. Coming to mind in recent years
are such standouts as Lacy Keesler, Corky Clark, Al
Ormond, Tommy Rivers, Phil Koonce, and Pete. Ash-
craft.

But with a bit of cash behind the qualified coaches
that Davidson has in these fields, the local athletic scene
should benefit greatly from channeling the money in
such direction.

Granted additional subsidization, we must admit that
there is little chance of Davidson ever becoming a big
football or basketball power, unless a tremendous revolu-
tion should be accomplished in these departments, with
regard to scholarships available, scholastic requirements,
coaching salaries, etc.

But with reasonable financial aid, the minor
sports should be able to field teams of champion-
ship calibre. There need be no shame in David-
son’s gaining its athletic significance as a tennis
or track or wrestling power, as Cerolina would
ride its basketball prowess to fame, or Duke its
football strength.

The interest shown by the student turnout at some
of the “minor” athletic events here has proven that
Davidsonians will come to see a good wrestler, a good
swimmer, a good soccer match.

So when we argue that the Davidson athletic program
needs better financial backing, let's not overlook the
