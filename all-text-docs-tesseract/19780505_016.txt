By ROBERT PAYNE

Staff Writer
Michael Murphy exemplifies/the old
adage of keeping at something until
you succeed—no matter how long it
takes. For Murphy, it took four albums
until he had a hit with Wildfire.
Before that he was known primarily
for the songs he wrote that were hits for
other artists: Geronimo’s Cadillac (Re
corded by Cher) and Cosmic Cowboy
(Nitty Gritty Dirt Band).

Murphey’s music is a fine blend of
folk, country, and rock. At times he
can sound like the ‘‘sensitive singer-
songwriter’ of the John Denver mold,
but at others he can rock out like a one
man version of the Eagles.

Murphy tonight

His latest album, Lone Wolf, is a
turn towards rock with the ripping cut,
Nothing is. Your Own which may
furnish him with another hit.

Murphy brings an intelligence to his
lyrics that is rarely found. As Chet
Flippo said in Rolling Stone: ‘‘His
songs are people with believable per-
sonalities. . . thay may not seem
formidable until you try to recall the
last song you heard that dealt with the
human experience."’

To put it succinctly, Murphy is the
rare pertormer that combines good
songwriting with good lyrics and
playing.

He will be at Love Auditorium at
8:00 tonight. Tickets are $3.00 at the
door.
