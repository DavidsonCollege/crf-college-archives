The Wildcat spirit team made the
trip down to Tampa to offer support.

Led by seniors Stephanie Baxter,
Bonner Mead, Sara Jane Spivey, and
Erica Thomas, the cheerleaders braved
the confines of Houlihan’s Stadium and
a rowdy South Florida mascot to cheer
for the Wildcat gridders.

While at the Davidson team hotel,
Thomas described the squad as a “very
talented, integrated group of women
that work well together.”

Cheerleading advisor Jeanette
Scire sees the squad as a family.

“The student population at David-
son is so small,” Scire said.

“It is very difficult to get people to
go out and perform in front of their
peers. And when you find people that
want to do that, they tend to feel a
common bond.”

To pay for its trip to Tampa, the
cheerleading squad sold shirts com-
memorating Davidson’ s centennial foot-
ball season.

“They feel such a strong commit-

" ment to Davidson College and its ath-

letes,” Scire added.

“They wanted to be here for the
football team, and they wanted the team
to know that they had the support of
Davidson with them.”

As the team prepares for the bas-
ketball season, its members hope that

the fans get more involved and come out.

to Belk Arena to back the Wildcats.

“We hope the fans are excited and
ready for some thrilling times,” sopho-

TAMPA, Fla. — Despite the
loss, Saturday's game against
South Florida was a milestone for
the Davidson football program.

The contest against the schol-
arship Bulls marked the first time in
more than 15 years that Davidson
had played a Division I-AA team.

And Davidson will have more
opportunities to play against Divi-
sion |-AA opponents in coming sea-
sons.

. “We usually play an entire Di-

vision Ill schedule,” coach Tim
Landis said. “But we played this
game because they (South Florida)
paid for our trip, and it was a great
experience for the guys.”

These games will definitely
be a new challenge for the Wild-
cats since most of these I-AA
squads give football scholarships
— something Davidson does not
do.

But there is a lot for Davidson
to gain from these contests.

The team will get more expo-
sure and will get a chance to play
in front of large crowds like the
27,000 that attended Saturday's
game.

“Even though we lost,” defen-
sive end Ben Spivey said, “this is
the greatest game | have ever.
played in.”

Bumgarner and Seegers finish stellar careers

By Curis Tutte
Staff Writer

The Southern Conference volley-
ball tournament this weekend marked
the end of two outstanding careers.

L.A. Bumgarner and Cindy
Seegers have both made an indelible
mark on the Davidson volleyball pro-
gram — through their contributions on
and off the court.

“The way our program has pro-
gressed in the last four years is a tribute
to them,” Wildcat coach Lisa Marston
said in a recent interview. “Our steady
rise in the conference is a tribute to their
leadership, for you don’t get to where
we are now without it.”

Over the last four years, the Wild-
cats have finished seventh, seventh,
sixth, and now third in the league stand-
ings.

And although they came up short
this weekend in Statesboro, Ga., the
Wildcats proved through this year’s
regular season that they belonged in the
conference’s first division.

Seegers, a 5-foot-5 setter from
Granville, Ohio, became enough of a
leader to be voted captain by her team-
mates prior to this season.

Last year, she led the team with
assists and aces. Her .352 attack per-
centage was also tops on the squad.

Her total assists placed her eighth
in the Southern last season.

. Even though she missed 10
matches due to injury this year, her total
career assist mark — 1,311 over the last
four seasons — was good enough for
third in the history of Davidson volley-
ball.

“Cindy has opened up and become
a great leader, especially vocally,”
Marston said.

“She is smart, knows the game
well, andis extremely coachable. Cindy
works very hard and pushes other around
her to be better.”

Bumgarner, from Salisbury, N.C.,
was highly recruited coming out of high
school, and chose Davidson over North
Carolina.

She started all four years and be-
came a stable force in the Southern
Conference.

Last year, she led the team in kills,
attempts, aces, and digs. She was fourth
in the conference in digs.

Bumgarner was out for six matches
this season due to an ankle sprain, but
still finished second in the league in digs
per game — behind only fellow Wildcat
Brooke Bentley.

She finishes her career with the
fourth-most kills in school history —
1,079 — and fourth in digs with 1,219.

“Over her career, she has truly
become a seasoned veteran and reacts to
the ball extremely well,” Marston said.

“She is effective in many different
situations.”

In their four years, Seegers. and
Bumgarner have seen the Davidson vol-
leyball program grow from being near
the bottom of the Southern Conference
to a team that consistently competes
with the best.

“They have been great examples to
everyone,” Marston said.

“They show that hard work really
does pay off. They push their team-
mates and keep them accountable.

“They are also always positive and
choose to learn from their mistakes rather
than dwell on them.” ;

“Being a member of this team is
indescribable,” Seegers said. ‘No other
experience compares.

“T have realized this and hope that
the younger girls on the team know it as
well.

“T wish them luck in the future and
I have faith they will continue the hard
work, desire, and commitment in the
years to come as Davidson becomes a
powerhouse in Southern Conference
volleyball.”

STATESBORO, Ga: — After
starting the Southern Conference sea-
son so well, the volleyball team’s
dreams of a league tournament cham-
pionship came to a quick end Friday
in a first round loss to sixth-seeded
Western Carolina.

The No. 3 Wildcats won the
first two games in convincing fash-
ion against the upstart Catamounts,
logging 15-8, 15-6 victories. But a
seven-point advantage in the third

game dis-

inte-

Western 3] grated

loss.

And Western, having seized the
momentum for good, raced to 15-8
and 15-6 wins in the last two games
to pull off the five-game upset,

Sophomore outside hitter Gina
Lawrence starred for the Wildcats,
posting 19 kills and nine digs. David-
son had five players with double-
digit digs, paced by rookie Brooke
Bentley’s 19. ;

Top-seeded Chattanooga, which
dominated the Southern Conference
this year, knocked off Western in the
title bout Sunday to earn the league’s
automatic berth to the NCAA tourna-
ment.

Davidson finished its season at
14-17.

Two Wildcats garnered indi-
vidual postseason honors, as L.A.
Bumgarner and Janet Duncan were
named second-team all-conference.

competing with the nation’s best, you
will attract attention.

And for 27 minutes, the Wildcats
did. After a Stephen Marshall basket
put Davidson within eight with just
over 13 minutes remaining, someone
on press row asked how long McKillop
would remain at Davidson.

It was then when the 8lue Devils
began their 13-1 spurt that iced the

game.

And when the smoke cleared, the
margin was 35. It was a rout.

The game was closer than that. But
to the casual espn2 viewer, this was
another game in which’a powerful ACC
team wore down and dominated a lesser
known school.

To a casual fan who didn’t see the’

game, but found the score in the paper,
Davidson was fodder in Duke's home

opener.

Duke is a top three team and it
played a near-flawless second half. It
was Davidson’s first game and it
showed. They kicked the ball around
all night and never found an offensive
rhythm,

That, combined with the Cameron
crowd, created a downward spiral that
Davidson could not escape.

Still, the Wildcats are better than

the typical small conference team.

With five players in the rotation
that are at least 6-foot-7, the Wildcats
do have the size and depth to compete
with virtually anyone.

Under McKillop’s guidance, the
Wildcats have gone from a four-game
winner to a perennial Southern Confer-
ence power. Now it’s time to take it to
the next level.

There are still opportunities. With

Wake Forest, Massachusetts, UNC
Charlotte, and — potentially, at least
— national champion Arizona remain-
ing on the slate, the Wildcats still have
a chance to attract national attention.

And if all else fails, there are the
NCAAs. Because at some point this
season, Davidson is going to beat some-
one they shouldn't.

It just didn’t happen Thursday
night.
