“Quips and Cranks” — 3
Is About Complete

Several Important Changes Made
in New Yearbook

Although a definite date for the ap-
pearance of- Davidson’s annual, “Quips
and Craaks,” has-not yct-been appoints
ed, the work on the book has been
progressing rapidly, and it shall prob-
ably come out sooner than any an-
nual has, here before.

In the year-book there are pictures
of five hundred men. This, of course,
does not include all the students. The
photographers made several trips to
the college, but still some of the stu-
dents failed to have their pictures
taken. :

The Senior section has already gone
to press. This section consists of six-4
ty pages with the pictures of two men
on each page. A rather unique ar-
rangement was carried out this year, in
this, the most important section. The
trite, habitual write-ups, which have
come to be so usual and meaningless,
have been omitted. The pictures of
the Seniors are placed diagonally on
the page. To the side of his picture,
the man’s name, address, and honors
are given.

The football All
spring sports, however, will necessarily
have to be curtailed somewhat, on ac-
count of the early publication. The an-
nual will probably be in the posession
the students before some the
spring sports have come to a close

Pictures of the fraternities, both so-
cial and honorary, clubs and other or-
ganizations are now in the hands of
the engravers.

In the faculty section, there is to be
a group picture of the faculty. This
feature was omitted last year.

Summarizing, it may be stated that
the proof is expected three-
fourths ‘of the copy is in, and the rest
will. be in this week, and the only mat-
ters left are the spring sports and the
plates for a few fraternities.

A College Degree
Needn’t Cramp Your
Literary Style

“Ex-collegians,” Claude Binyon dis-
covers in the May College Humor, “are
sprinkled throughout shoW business so
indiscriminately as to cause someone
with time on his hands to wonder how
and why they got there. A study of
their academic training reveals that
most of them intended to enter some
other profession, if they intended to
enter any.

“Tim McCoy went to West Point and
then turned into a cowboy actor for
pictures. Ed Gorman studied for the
ministry arid awoke to find himself a
monologist in vaudeville. Paul White-
man, no less, once studied mining at
Boulder. Richard Ringling, whose
dad, John, collected considerable bird-
seed in the circus game, landed in
opera after several years of intensive
preparation as a Student of electrical
engineering at Montana University.

“Richard Dix rested for some time at
the University of Minnesota, not think-
ing of much in particular, and event-
ually slid into pictures where his con-
tract calls for salary even while rest-
ing. :

“Considerable’ choice money and
fame is being garnered in Hollywood
by college graduates wielding the di-
rectorial megaphone, or—in the case
of talking pictures—waving a silent
finger. On the Warner Brothers lot
five of seven directors who once said
‘yes’ to profs now have enough yes-
men surrounding them to start an
anvil chorus. Included are Howard
Bretherton, of Stanford, Lloyd Bacon
of Santa Clara, Archie Mayo, of Co-
lumbia, Bryan Foy, of De La Salle, and

Michael Curtiz all the way from
Budapest U.

Reliance, the third step, was force-

fully illustrated in Abraham's life when
he was commanded to sacrifice his son,
Isaac. Yet when all human resources
were gone, he trusted in God; he rested
on God rather than on God's blessings.

A growing: yearning for God was de-
clared the fourth step in faith, The feel-
ing that you have given all things to God
and that all really satisfying things must
come from Him is the mark of a real
believer. The things of this world grad-
ually lose théir power to satisfy as the

“relation with God deepens.

Finally, a spirit of perseverance is very
essential. The ability to keep on in the
path of faith regardless of obstacles will
at last bring us into the presence of our
father and of those who trod before us
in the path of faith.

ing on March 24, 1927, at which Doctor
Richardson barely escaped with his life,
after spending a whole day concealed
under some straw in a cellar, fed by some
friendly Chinese. He left under the pro-
tection of the United States Government,
but abandoned every possession of him-
self and family to the looters.

Upon his return to the United States
he was elected to the Chair of Christian
Missions of Union Theological Seminary
at Richmond, Ile chose to accept this
chair despite the invitation of the Chinese
for him to return to the Seminary at
Nanking, as he feels that he is more
needed in this country where missions
are on trial, He is just completing his
first year in the Seminary and has won
a high place in the estimation and affec-

turned to Davidson this week after a
successful five-day trip, on which they
won victorie sover the racqueteers of
Wofford, Erskine, Clemson and Fur-

counts, which indicates that the David-
son netmen had an easy time.

team were John T. Roddey, Jr., of
Rock Hill, S. C, captain; Frontis
Johnston, of Greensboro, Ga.; A. L.
Halverstadt; of Atlanta, Ga., and W.

Superb Pitching of
Ball Defeats Cats

Fifteen hundred people saw the
Wildcats lose a fast game to the Tar
Heels from Chapel Hill in their annual
Easter Monday game. Jim Ball was
the big noise from the Carolina camp
pitching a brilliant game backed by
fast fielding. Kugler started the
mound duty for the ’Cats and was re-
lieved by Morrow’ in the seventh
frame. The final score was 4-2 with
the Heels on the big end.

Davidson started the scoring in the
first half of the first inning when
Marks, Goodson, and Proctor all got
singles and Marks scored. The Tar
Heels tied the count in the second
inning, however, when Lufty doubled
to centerfield and scored on a long sac-
rifice fly. Carolina got another run
in the third inning when the bases be-
came well loaded by a double, a single
and a base on balls and when a
double play attempted by Kugler fail-
ed. In the fifth inning, the ’Cats tied
the score when Ratchford was ad-
vanced two bases by sacrifices of
Marks and Goodson. Carolina scored
a run in the sixth due to a single and
a double and in the seventh due to a

single, a sacrifice and an error.

Vesper Programs Announced for
Remaining Services of Year

At “Y” Vespers, April 14, the annual
installation service will take place. This
is perhaps the most important meeting
of the year. At this meeting, the old
“Y" cabinet will retire and the new
cabinet will take its place. After the
formal installation, Dr. Donald W.
Richardson of the Union Theological

Seminary will talk. Dr. Richardson
will be here to conduct a mission in-
stitute. His talk will be an appeal for
Christian ‘service and for the young
men of Davidson to stand behind the
“Y" in its efforts towards this end.
As former vice-president of the Y. M.
C. A. and as cabinet member at David-
son, he well-fitfed to address the
students at this time. _A rich field. of
Christian service constitutes Dr. Rich-
ardson’s life and he has gained a won-
derful experience. His message prom-
ises to be one of the best of thy year.
