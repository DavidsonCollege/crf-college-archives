‘Cat Thinclads Run Last

In Conference Tourney

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer

The Davidson  thinclads,
slowed down by injuries to
two key performers, sputter
ed to a last place finish in
the Southern Conference meet
held last Saturday.

The team managed: to gar-
ner only 10 points, which,
though only one point be-
hind sixth place VIMI, was a
distant 91 behind winner Wil-
liam and Mary.

East Carolina took second
place with 78 and Furman

was third with 68.
Suey Kirley grabbed half

of Davidson points as he
took third place in the shot
put and fourth in the discus.

Other places for the Wild-
cats were a fifth in the 440
yard relay, ‘Rick Lyon's fifth
in the 100 yard dash, and
Ray Swetenburg’s third in
the high ‘hurdles. :

In scoring its comfortable
victory, William and Mary
men set two of three new
records.

Chris Harvey won the pole
vault with 16’1'’ and Ben
Helmandollar the 220 yard
dash in 21.4.

Tom Malik of Furman set
the other with a 14.0 clocking
in the high hurdles.

The Outstanding Athlete
Award went to Furmian’s Lee
Fidler, who won the three
mile run and then the six
miles run'in 29:08, qualify-
ing him for the NCAA meet
to be held in Washington.

Davidson did not qualify
any participants for that
meet.

Though naturally disap-

pointed Coach Heath Whit-
tle said the team performed
well.

The loss of sprinter Tom
Richardson and distance man
George Edwards hurt the
team tremendously.

Tomorrow Whittle is
taking several members of
the team to thé-North Caro
lina state meet at Duke Uni-
versity.

Because of the senior com-

the Southern Conference ten-
nis tournament held here
last weekend.

The Davidson team took
titles in. six of the nine divi-
sions in the’ tournament and
racked up 23 team points.

Furman held second with
18 team points and two in-
dividual wins.

This conference victory
made tennis coach Harry
Fogleman the first coach in
the history of Davidson Col-
lege to win two conference
tiles in one school year.

Fogleman coaches the soc-
cer team in the fall) which
won its first tile this year.

Fogleman is only the sec
ond coach in the conference
to win this honor.

In the tournament the heav-
ily favored Wildcats took five
of the six individual cate
gories, losing only in the
fifth to Johnny Harrison of
Furman.

Four of the other David
son men had to fight off Pal
adins for the winner's spot.

‘Bob Koury defeated How-
ard Hunt of Furman in a
hard fought contest on first
court.

Jeff Dumansky also fought
a three set match with his

prehensive exams, tthe team
once again will not be at
full strength.

Among those making the
trip are Swetenburg, Kirley,
Ted Elile't in the intermedi-
ate hurdles, Howard Boyd in
the mile, Edwards, in the
880 yard run and Keith Ev
erett in the long and triple
jumps.

This will be the final mect
this year for the ‘Cats.
