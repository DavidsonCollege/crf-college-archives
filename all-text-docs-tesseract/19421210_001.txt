Vhe freshmen members of the

S.A.E., Phi Gam, and Beta frater-
nitics will be on campus for an ad-
ditional week. Also there are some
twenty freshmen who are not fra-
ternity members who have been
added to this list.

Ihe reason for this additional
sentence is ‘that these freshmen

were allowedgo go to their functions
which were all held in Charlotte, and
of course, this took a large number

of freshmen who were all on a two

area.
The few other freshmen who are

DEBATE TEAM

The  Brinegar-Tucke? team
placed fourth in the debating
tournament held last week
Charlotte, with the Crane-
Pickard team running near the
top, but»not officially placed.

The subject for debate this
year is “Resolved, that the Unit-
ed Nations Should Establish a
Permanent Federal Union with ‘
Power to Tax and Regulate In-
ternational Commerce, Main-
tain a Police Force, Settle Dis-
putes Among Nations, and En-
force such Settlements, and Pro-

ples of the Union.”
