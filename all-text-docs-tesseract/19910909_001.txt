Project Life Begins Second Drive For Marrow Donors

By Walter Price

With a goal of 500 partici-
pants, the Project Life Committee
at Davidson is preparing for its
second bone marrow drive. The
committee plans to target mem-
bers of the class of 1995 to meet
this year’s goal.

According to committee
member Catherine Turner, the
group hopes to hold this year’s
testing “sometime before Thanks-
giving”. Before the testing can
occur, close to $30,000 has to be
raised to pay for the process. This
money pays for the $60 tests that
have to be given to each partici-
pant.

Presently, the committee is
soliciting donations from the
Davidson College community, as
well as outside sources, to finance
the marrow testing. Fund raising
plans by the committee include
setting up booths at Alumni and

Parents Weekends and auctions .

sponsored by Rusk and PiKA.
According to. Turner, the group
also hopes to pursue more corpo-
rate donations, an outlet that was

The Project 13 Lite Committee.

formed last year following the
experiences of Davidson junior
David Lindsay(see accompanying
story). Freshman year, Lindsay
wentthrougha bone marrow trans-
planttotreathis leukemia. Spurred
by his ordeal, Lindsay and several
other Davidson students formed a
group to test the college commu-

nity and enter them into the na-
tional registry for potential bone
marrow donors.

Last year, working with an
anonymous matching donor , fund
raisers, and solicitation of the col-
lege community, the committee
was able to raise the $30,000
needed to test 476 people. The476
participants in the testing were the
most among North Carolina Bone
Marrow Donor Chapters. This
year, the group’s goal is to test 500
individuals to enroll in the bone
marrow registry.

The testing process involves
the drawing of three tablespoons

. of blood from each potential do-

nor. The blood is then sent to Red
Cross to be tested and entered into
the registry. According to Turner,
ifa blood specimen comes back as
a potential match, the potential
donor undergoes a second blood
sampling.

In last year’s drive, 30 partici-
pants went this far in the process,
with the odds of an individual
getting this far at 1:20,000. Turner
also noted that one student has
advanced to the final testing stage
and should hear within- ten weeks
whether or -not he/she will be a
donor.

The testing that is done by the
Red Cross involves the drawing of

ual's human leukocyte antigen"
(HLA). Since HLA types vary
greatly, there is aneed to have a
large registry of potential. do-

By David Lindsay

Why me? This question is of-
ten asked in the face of life’ s adver-
sity. Life can seem unfair in so
many ways--innocent people are
killed by drunk drivers, an unlucky
bystander gets shot by a stray bul-
let, a woman gets brutally raped,
young children suffer from deadly
diseases, and the list goes on...I
have discovered thata when life is-
sues forth a difficult challenge, the

best course to take is to meet that”

challenge head-on andat full speed.
As Theodore Roosevelt once said,
“Don’t foul, don’t flinch--hit the
line hard.”

My senior-year of high school
was rollingalong quite smoothly at
good ‘ol West Charlotte that win-
ter of 1988. I had somehow finally
finished my “early decision” appli-
cation to Davidson. I was already
mired in the dreaded “senior
slump.” I was enjoying my last
year of school with the typical zest

and excitement that anyone
wouldhave. :

I was anxiously looking for-
ward to my senior season of bas-
ketball hoping that my summer of
running and practicing would earn
me something better than another
year of having that great front row
seaton the bench. Allthe pieces of
my life seemed to be neatly falling
into place. Then, as they say, “the
doo-doo hit the fan.” And, boy,
when that doo-doo hit, it sure hit
hard.

Thad begun to gradually notice
that the level of my play at basket-
ball practice had dropped. I
couldn’t get my outside shots to
fall, I had difficulty getting up and
down the court every time and my
rim-shattering dunks weren’t quite
as rim-shattering. (Okay, so I’ve
never had a rim-shattering dunk
except in my dreams.)

Anyway, I blamed my de-
creased intensity on my nagging
leg pains. My mother guessed that
I had an iron deficiency, so the
afternoon before our first game at
East Mecklenburg, I stopped by
the doctor’s office for what I
thought would be a “routine five-
minute visit.’ That visit would
turn into a year-long saga.

The real nervous anxiety set in
when my doctorrepeated the blood
tests for a third time. The look on
his face when he entered the exam-
ining room was definitely one of
“false confidence.” He sent me
over to the local hospital for some
more “routine” tests. By this time,
I was on the verge of panicking. I
remember sitting fearfully in the

hospital chapel fervently praying
that all would be all right.

The doctor eventually ap-
peared at the end of the hall and
motioned for me to come into‘my
father’s chaplain’s office. He sat
down in front of me, looked me
directly in theeyes, and saidcalmly,
but firmly, those words Ill likely
never forget, “David you have a
form of leukemia.” i remember at
that point I made a feeble attempt
to make a joke, commenting that,
“Gee, I guess I will miss the bas-
ketball game tonight.” Unfortu-
nately, my fake smile could not
hide the absolute absence of hope
that I felt at that moment.

The next four weeks that De-
cember were not exactly my ideal
way of spending Christmas vaca-
tion. Iunderwentarather grueling
series of tests and chemotherapy.
My body was literally bombed with
medication after medication.

Up until this point in my life,
medicines had names like Sudafed
and Robitussin, but now they had
more ominous-sounding names

like L’aspariginase, Cytoxin,
methotrexate, and prednisone. At
the end of this four week barrage,
I had achieved a disease free state
called remission.

’ Over the next five months I
entered the hospital about every
three weeks to receive continuous
drips of chemotherapy for three or
four days at a time.

This medication was designed

New Women's Eating House
Forum To Be Held Monday

By Tom Price

This evening at 8pm a forum
will be held in the gallery of Cham-
bers concerning the formation of a
new eating house for women. After
several years of informal discus-
sion, a group of students have de-
cided to attempt to

women. The women who have
organized the forum havecreateda
questionnaire which will be dis-
tributed to all the women at the
meeting. Responses to the ques-
tions will be carefully studied by
the Dean of Students Office and

any tangible moves toward the
house’s creation will come only
after a significant interest is dem-
onstrated.
