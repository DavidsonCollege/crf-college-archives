Question

of the Week

All there has
been constant agitation in favor of
with the Scripts 'n’
Pranks. Accusations against the
magazine in the ears of the
public as much as the word “com-
bine.” We were able to find but
person who comes to the de-
fense of that publication. Of course,
none of the writers are in any way

Davidsonian :
“What
is your opinion of the Scripts 'n’
Pranks?”

Ken Lawson, Senior:

The American people are noted
for their sense of humor, but even
that is often strained by the things
appearing in the Scripts ’n’ Pranks.
It’s not that the work is so bad—
it just always appears so much like
things which appeared in the Da-
vidsonian at earlier dates. As an
ex-member of the Davidsonian staff,
I realize that the magazine has a
useful place, however; it is a good
spot for things which don’t “rate”
the Davidsonian. (After this I sure-
ly ought to be able to collect my
back wages from manager Lati-
mer.)

Paul Bumbarger, Sophomore:

Without a doubt Scripts ’n’
Pranks is a disgrace to Davidson
College. When it cannot find any
better way to fill up space than to
knock such an outstanding publi-
cation as the Davidsonian, it should
be abolished. There is some excuse
for its jokes not being original, but
when it has to pattern its name
after another campus publication,
that’s the last straw.

“Puffy” McDuffie, Sophomore:

Undoubtedly the college magazine
could play a more useful role in
campus affairs than its present of-
fering shows. Just how this is to
be effected is, of course, another
point. However, the staff is picked
through “weeding out process”
and should be fully capable of put-
ting out almost any kind of publica-
tion they so desire. I think, as a
reader, some of the stories could be
improved and that further
emphasis should be placed on bet-
ter features other than the satirical
publication of the newspaper. Pre-
sentation of more campus snapshots
would undoubtedly improve things.
Glucose, a class to himself:

Why—does Davidson College have
a magazine? Never heard of it. Oh
yes, I do remember a boy named
Mutt Riller feeding me some of
those “tid-bits” in the Stu-store.
Confidentially, . . . But what is all
this “jabber” about? I’m all for
all Davidson College publications
so that includes the
Pranks, I guess.

Bill Marquess, Senior:

Arguments supporting the exist-
ence of Scripts ’n’ Pranks can prob-
ably be found, but I have yet to
hear any worthy of the name.
Merely the backwash of The Da-
vidsonian, it fails to fulfill either
a or literary purpose,
ideas, I understand, were

present in the minds of
its founders. I will say in defense
of the magazine, however, that
we have found it pretty good for

office those cold nights. Hi ya,

Tom Brown, Freshman:

I guess the Scripts ’n’. Pranks
is like all other college magazines
in the country. I think that it
would help if those crude short
stories would be eliminated. The
editors might also print some jokes
which hasn’t been printed in every

other magazine first. We want

more cartoons.

Cam Wilson, Freshman:
Personally, this is not all my

opinion, but after being threaten-

ed and being told that Glucose

liked the Scripts ’n’ Pranks, well

I just can’t see that’ the humor (?)
magazine is so hot. Anyhow, I
believe that. Glucose was bribed
or sump’n. Maybe Rut Miller told
him that the Davidsonian sent out
that Ex-Lax so he would natur-
ally side with the school paper’s
deadly enemy. But after all, some
of those jokes in the last maga-
zine were actually awful; in fact,
if the magazine staff would take
a few lessons from the editors of
U. of K.’s “Sour Mash” or U. N.
C.’s “Bucaneer,” it would be im-
proved a great deal. Of course,
there is the strict censorship of
the Davidson faculty, but brains
could cook up some’ mighty hot
jokes that the faculty couldn’t see
through, but would send the stu-
dent body into hysterics. What
else can I say? After all, I’m on
the staff of the Davidsonian.
Joe Liles, Sophomore:
