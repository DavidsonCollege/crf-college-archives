Broadway musical comes

1776 spots egoistic,
erratic revolutionaries

By BARBARA PAYNE

The musical “1776’’ is not just
another pile of powdered wigs con-
tributing to America’s Bicentennial
Masterpiece. Written by Peter Stone,
with music and lyrics by Sherman
Edwards, ‘‘1776”’ will be performed in
Love Auditorium Wednesday, Dec-
ember 10 at 8:15 p.m.

“1776” depicts the American Revo-
lution as being much more than a
song and dance. Substance is sup-
plied to those powdered wigs by a
responsible play performed by com-
petent actors.

Sam Kressen as Ben Franklin:
a lecher and a clown.

Conservative members of the Contin-
ehtal Congress emphasize a point.

The play focuses on John Adams’
attempts to persuade his cohorts to
declare America’s independence.
With the aid of Benjamin Franklin,
Adams diverts Thomas Jefferson's
attention from his new wife long

enough to get him to write a
declaration of independence. The
three, using something less than

moving rhetoric, ultimately persuade
the more conservative delegates‘ to
sign the document.

Obviously these men were full of
human foibles. Meet Benjamin
Franklin, lecher and clown. Stephen
Hopkins can certainly down a few.
And Thomas Jefferson plays the
violin--but not without a few painful
notes.

Our Founding Fathers were self-in-
terested, often petty and often led
astray.

They were also men of commit-
ment. Procuring 13 signatures was no
easy task. Throughout the play, the
delegates receive disheartening mis-
sives from George Washington who
relates the conditions of real war. It
seems almost miraculous that these
“common’’ men were able to attain
such an idealistic goal as freedom.

And when the play is over, we
blush less at that dirty word, ‘‘pat-
riotism.”’

The production of ‘‘1776”’ to appear
at Davidson is directed by Don

Perkins, who plays the role of John
Adams, Perkins, like Adams, comes
from Boston. Perkins has played 22
Shakespearean roles, 3 contemporary
musical roles and has appeared in a
total of 146 stage attractions, a rare
feat for the American performer.

Benjamin Franklin is played by
Sam Kressen, who is no stranger to
the role. Kressen has been impersona-
ting Franklin legally since 1955, and
played Dr. Franklin in the Original
National Company of ‘'1776.”’

John Almberg plays Thomas Jef-
ferson. A native of Illinois, Almberg
has appeared as Oscar in ‘‘Seesaw”’
and was understudy to Curly in the
New York Lincoln Center’s produc-
tion of ‘‘Oklahoma.”’

Peter Stone, author of the play, has
quite a list of accomplishments,

including an Oscar for his screenplay
‘Father Goose’ and an Emmy for his
contributions to ‘‘The Defenders’
television series. ‘‘1776’’ has: brought
him a Tony Award and the Drama
Critics’ Award for Best Musical.
Most highlights of the musical are,
of course, in its music. Skillfully
adapted by Sherman Edwards, com-
poser-lyricist, the songs successfully
bond 200 years of cultural change.
Particularly moving is ‘‘Mama, Look
Sharp,” a mournful statement on the
not all-glorious Revolutionary War.
