Newcomers

Seven of the following players are
the vaunted recruiting class of 1982.
The eighth is a walk-on who has an ex-
cellent chance of sticking with the team.

They’ re not going to turn Davidson into ~

a Top 20 program tomorrow night or the
next full moon. They won’t even turn it
into that caliber program for Christmas.
By. January, however, they will be con-
tributing enough to really help the team,
and their contribution may well be the
needed boost to get Davidson back into
the NCAA playoffs.

Harold “Pepper” Bego, 6-0, 160

The first thing you notice about Pep-
per Bego is his fluid and smooth-as-silk
movement with the ball. The talent is
there, but Bego, a high school forward,
will have a long transition to the point
guard position.

He penetrates well, and he passes
well, but, as is the case with most fresh-
men, he needs to improve defensively.

His best shot is the baseline jumper, but

he isn’t afraid to take the ball to the hoop
against anyone. He will be a great one.

Gerry Born, 6-7, 210
Born does a lot of things you don’t no-
tice unless you’re watching him specif-
iclaly. He outrebounds two players ona
missed fast-break layup here, he makes
a good pass there, he drives for a left-
handed jumper over there.

Hussey says, “He probably has as
great a nose for, the ball as anyone
you're gonna see. He’s in the top three
inrebounding every day. He can score,
and he passes pretty well.”

Born is versatile as well. He can
play the three or four spot, but can play
the second guard as well.

Rafael Hernandez, 6-6, 200

Rafael Hernandez is an unmined vein of

, talent. Says Hussey, “A player. A talent
» if there’s ever been one.” The problem
.. is all that talent needs refining, but Raf

gi geaially getting the hang of it.

- “He’s had difficulty. picking things
Up, ” explains Hussey. “But when a play
, cbeeaks down, he. gets it-in on sheer tal-

“ent.” Midnight Madness showed that,

DAVIDSONIAN/1982-83

» ‘strong, has great leaping ability, and is
an excellent rebounder. In time, he will

BASKETBALL PREVIEW

Jim McConkey, 6-9, 220

McConkey, betwixt celebration of a
St. Louis World Championship, has
“worked on his weaknesses a great
deal.” He is a fine shooter within his
range and has a wide array of inside
moves. He’ ll play the five spot, but like
the other freshmen he’s having diffi-
culty learning the new systems.

He hits the offensive boards well
and is a very good tap-shooter, but he
will need more strength to compete on
Davidson’s schecule.

Bill Naso, 6-1, 170

Bill Naso is a walk-on point guard
who won’t quit. Hussey marvels, “He’s
a tremendous competitor. He’s a true
point guard. He does a lot of good
things. He’1]1 make somebody else better
if nothing else happens.”

Naso’s_ ballhandling skills have
earned him the nickname “E. T.”, and
he’s a good passer besides. He often
tries to do too much with the ball,
though, a common freshman mistake.
He comes to us from Myers Park High
School in Charlotte.

Ken Niehbur, 6-7, 210

Bluntly, Ken Niehbur is a ball. Ask
anyone who tries to rebound against
him. Niehbur is the sort of player who
doesn’t worry about scoring points—he
wants to rebound. He gets very good po-
sition and then hauls it in. He averaged
17 rebounds per game in high school.

“He’s been a really pleasant sur-
prise ,” says Hussey. “he knows his role.
Ideally he should be a 6-9 center rather
than a 6-7.” Don’t bother telling hmi
that—he’ll play like a 6-9 center any-
way. He’ll play in the four and five

spots.

Bill Pollock, 6-10, 215

Surprisingly, Bill Pollock is playing
at the number three small forward posi-
tion. “We think he’s going to be a very
good shooter,” says Hussey. “He can
run. He needs to learn how to be more
aggressive.”

That, surely, is his biggest weak-
ness, but with time he'll become
stronger and more aggressive. He may
play a little of that number four post po-
sition. He is a talent, though.

' ‘Ted Wolfe, 6-8, 205

Like Franz, Wolfe is a good chemis-
try player. “He understands the impor-
tance of playing as a team,” says Hus-
sey. Wolfe is a rugged player, some-
what reiniscent of a Tribus with a small-
er range.

He is a fairly strong rebounder‘and

hits the offensive boards well. He’ll
' play the number four post position.
