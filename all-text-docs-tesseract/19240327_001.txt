JIM HENDRIX A DELEGATE

Conference Brings Together Repre-
sentatives of Many Educational
Institutions

Davidson College will be represented

by two delegates at the third annual con-
vention of the Southern Federation of
College Students which will convene at
Chapel Hill as guests of the University
of North Carolina on April 10 and 11.
Jim Hendrix, president-elect of the stu-
dent body, will be one of the delegates.
The other representative will be selected
by the student council within the next
few days.
At a meeting of the student body about
month ago, it was decided to enter
Davidson among the number of leading
Southern colleges which at present form
the federation. Davidson the third
college in the state to enter this organ-
ization, North Carolina and N. C. State
already being members. It was through
the combined efforts of A. M. Hillhouse
and P. C. Beatty, of State, that this for-
ward step was taken by the Davidson
student body. It is hoped that every
leading institution of advanced education
in the South will become a member of
this movement.

The Southesn Federation of College
Students was organized at Georgia’ Tech
in 1922. It was the idea of Al Staton, all-
Southern football man from that institu-
tion. The purpose of the association is
to spread student body government over
the South and to extend, through ex-
periences felt at the different colleges,
the benefits of student body government
in handling cases of all types that may

Athletic Association

Baker and Selser Elected Vice-
Presidents—Christian
Secretary-Treasurer

Clayton Covington, of Laurinburg, N.
C., better known to his fellow-students
as Ted, a member of the rising Senior
Class, was elected tothe presidency of
the Athletic Association for 1924-25, on
Tuesday morning. Three ballots were
cast for the office, and the race was ex-

ceedingly close.. Ted has distinguished
himself in various athletic activities for |
the past three years, and the honor is
well-deserved. On the first ballot, only |
the three highest candidates were de-|
termined, these being Covington, Boggs,
and Beall. Neither ofthe three candi-|
dates received a majority onthe second
ballot, but Covington and Boggs received |
the highest number of votes. The last}
ballot was cast to determine which of |
these two men should head the associa- |
tion, and it was in this election that Cov-!
ington received the requisite majority
of votes.

For Vice-President, Baker received a
majority on the second ballot; but the |
second vice-president was not elected un-
til after a third ballot had been cast.
Selser, running against Laird, had a mar-
gin of votes in this ballot and was de-
clared elected tothe second vice-pres-
idency.

For secretary, Botannon, Christian,
and Sapp received the highest number
of votes onthe first ballot, none of the
candidates receiving a majority, however.
Bohannon was eliminated from the race

election, Christian secured the majority

primary was run-off between Appleby

and Lawson.

The Junior Class is entitled to three
representatives on the Student Council
besides its president, and those who had
been nominated by that body for selec-

en a good leader. The corps of officers
elected last Monday are good men, and
will make splendid leaders of the Junior
Class.

Davidson Meets

Emory Team On
Neutral Ground

Queens College has been definitely
decided upon as the scene of the forensic
combat between Davidson and Emory
University. This word battle will be on
April 11th. The team that represents
Davidson is P. J, Story, L. D. Elkins, and
W. M. Cox. The subject of the debate is,
Resolved, That France is justified in her
occupation of the Ruhr.

- Three days later, a team composed of
D. B. Wharton, L. C. Little and D. B.
Walthall, will meet a Trinity team at
Trinity. The subject of this contest will
be the same as the one with Emory.

When the judges selected the six de-
baters who would represent Davidson
they voted for the men by numbers. In
order to show no discrimination as to
what men would meet any particular
team it was decided to use the first,
third and fifth to. meet Emory, and the
others to meet Trinity.

In the six men selected Davidson has

Fraternities Make Plans for Enjoy-
able Celebration of Annual

Only ten days remain beforethe non-

fraternity party on April 5th. Every

preparation has been made to make the}

week-end a success and every indica-
host of the fair sex as guests for the
occasion, Scads of girls is the word, and
see to it that she is present.

The individual chapters have made ar-
rangements for rooms for their visiting
guests and there will be no difficulty. in
arranging places to stay for every girl
who has been invited to visit the hill at
that time.

Each chapted has been shouldering its
share ofthe duties arising in connection
with the week-end and the program will
be carried out without a flaw. At a Pan-
Hellenic meeting last week it was de-
cided that every fraternity man should
write home for a box for the week-end
of the party.

Then Saturday night, after the picture
show a table will be spread on the cam-

pus and heaped high with the pride of
the South’s culinary talent. Of course if
the weather man does tell the truth for!
once and we do have a rainy night the
table can be spread in the gym. But if
not, and he doesn’t make a mistake like
that often, Japanese lanterns will trans-
form the campus to a quaint bit of Japan.

Rows of these lanterns will be hung
irom Elm Row to Oak Row and between
these halls andthe Literary Society build-
ings. There will be light enough too,
around the table to make it appear at its
best.

The program for the week-end will of-
fer Cntertainment every moment Satur-

day. Sunday and Monday the halls will
be at the complete disposal of’ the
guests.

In the afternoon Saturday a baseball
game with Elon will furnish the excite-
ment. After supper at the gym you will
feel the proper atmosphere with Little
Old New York on the screen before you.

For Commencement

ginning to take definite shape. The

vious ones in the variety and attractive-
ness of the program. The events of the
occasion will begin with the baccalau-
reate sermon on Sunday, June tst, and
end with the lowering of the Senior Class
flag on Wednesday, June 4th. Between
the first feature of the program and the

cial class features for the program, the
nature of which will not be disclosed un-
til a later date. The first of these sur-
prise features will be presented on Mon-
day, and the second will take the place

ment.
