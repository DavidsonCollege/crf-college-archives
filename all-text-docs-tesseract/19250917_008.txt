Control—Freshmen Will be
Given Consideration

SERVICE

| With the arrival on the campus of an-
| other crowd of Freshmen, another Court
|of Control begins its stupendous task of
| convincing them that they are Freshmen
|and training them*up in the.way they

| should go.

The court is headed this year by F. R.

| Hudson of the Senior class, who will pre-

side at all meetings of the court and see,

|that each case is given fair and careful
| consideration, Frank is well fitted for
| this position, having been a member of
| the court last year. The other members
lof the court are:

| R. McRae, and P. R. Maulden,
Two and a half years ago when haz-
|ing was voluntarily abolished by the Stu-

Seniors, L. L. Deck, |
L. B. Huie, M. E. Miller; Juniors, C. C. |
| Murchison, R. L. Lincoln; Sophomores, |

ident Body, the Court of Control was |

| established to take care of unruly Fresh-

men, and it has been functioning suc- |

cessfully ever since.

Its duty is to hear, |

of the upper classmen against Fresh- |

|men for any kind of improper conduct, |

| such as jibing, violating Freshman regu-
|lations, or breaking college traditions.
| Several modes of punishment are inflict-
}ed upon those convicted, varying in se-
verity with the gravity of the offense.
Each year the court operates more
|smoothly and efficiently, and it can be

| depended on to handle the Freshmen this |

| year, for the judge has already announc-
ed that they mean business.
