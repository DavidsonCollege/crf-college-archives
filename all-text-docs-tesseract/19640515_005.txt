CAT TALES

BY JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

FOR WHAT IT’S WORTH

_ Another athletic season ends for Davidson with to-
night’s baseball game against UNC. It’s been a pretty
good one.

Davidson's teams combined for 78 wins against 48
losses—not bad for any school—as the soccer, basketball,
and tennis teams combined to give Davidson 49 of their
wins and only 11 of their losses.

At first, I thought I would comment on the season
as a whole and recap it, but there really isn’t much to
say. The annual has a pretty good summary, and I think
little can be added to what Rick Lowery has said about
the individual teams through the year.

However, 1 would like to say a few words about a
few athletes who I think merit some extra recognition
in addition to their awards yesterday. Every year an
Outstanding Freshman Athlete award is given, and I'd
like to give my selections, for whatever they’re worth,
for the outstanding athlete in each of the three upper
classes.

The sophomore class fielded some pretty fair ath-
letes this year, including David Brown, Jim Stokes, Dick
Hurd, and Pack Hindsley (and Sonny Graves). But Dick
Snyder, the “soph sensation,” was undoubtedly the best
in the class and is one of the best all-around athletes
Davidson has ever produced. His basketball heroics,
highlighted by super efforts against Princeton (with All-

America Bill Bradley playing him man-to-man) and Ohio |;

State, are pretty much well known to everybody.

in baseball he has been one of the Wildcats’ top
sluggers all year long, as well as one of the mainstays
of the pitching staff. Participating on the track team
when he had time, he managed several firsts in the broad
jump and the triple jump. It is too bad he doesn’t have
opportunity to play every sport here. I don’t doubt that
he could.

The juniors this year had several standouts, includ-
ng Alan Turner, Steve Heckard, and three sport man
Don Davidson. However, there is.no question but that
Fred Hetzel is the best. The honors bestowed on Hetzel
this year are too numerous to mention, as are all his
great performances, but suffice it to say that Hetzel has
brought more credit to Davidson College than any single
undergraduate in the history of the school.

Selection of the outstanding senior athlete isn't as
clear cut as the other two. Terry Holland, Earl Cole,
Benny Coxton, Billy Mills, and Rick Smyre could all
qualify, but my choice is football co-captain Russ Walls.
Russ’s continuous determination and aggressive action
throughout the football season won him a share of the
LaFar defensive trophy, and he also won the award for
the top academic average on the team. In addition to
playing football, Russ wrestled in the heavyweight brack-
et on the wrestling team and was one of Coach Parker’s
few consistent winners.

A TURNING POINT?

Coach Dol has finished recruiting the freshman
football squad. and it really looks.like this team may be
a turning point in Davidson football. ; ;

Fourteen players are dividing approximately eight
scholarships between them, but Coach Dole seems to
have done a really good job in making use of the money
he has.

Three Shrine Bowlers—Pete Glidewell of Reidsville,
Kim Johnson of Rockingham, and Billy Taylor of Kinston
—head the freshman roster. ;

Perhaps the best known recruit, Taylor quarter-
backed the North Carolinians in the Shrine game, but
Coach Dole reports that he will use Taylor as a halfback
to take full advantage of his running ability. :

Other “name” players among the recruits are Ken
Vogel, an All-State tackle from Connecticut; Chip Scharf-
schwerdt, a Florida quarterback who was sought also by
Georgia Tech; and Lowell Bryan, an All-Conference
tackle from Arlington, Virginia who was accepted at
beth Dartmouth and Harvard and was offered a full
scholarship to an ACC school.

All softball games postponed

were played this week. The final
softball standings were as ex-
pected. with the exception of
the Kappa Sigs’ final record.

The Phi Gams won the soft-
ball race with an 11-1 record.
There would have been a tie for
first place if there had been no
upsets in the final week of play,
but the Kappa Sigs dropped a
game Wednesday afternoon to
the Pikas. This loss dropped
them from a tie for first place
into a tie for second with the

‘To Extend Streak To 9

The ‘Cats waited only until
the fifth frame before putting
the game out of reach in the
second contest. They scored -
eight runs in that inning to

take a practically insurmount-

able 11-2 lead.

Shortstop Rick Smyre with two
singles and three runs batted
in and left fielder Steve Heck-
ard with a single and a triple
and four RBI's led the David-
son attack. Starter Dave John-
son, who seems to pitch only
well enough to win. cruised to
his third win in four decisions
with seventh inning help from
Howard Bryan. Johnson struck
out ten in the 11-5 victory.

Tuesday, the ‘Cats built their
Conference record to 9-5 with
two wins over Citadel at Char-
leston. They beat the Cadets
(and two umpires whom both
sides labeled incompetent) 3-2
and 8-4.

In the opener. Wildcat start-
er Earle Cole bore down when
it counted to pick up ‘his fifth
win in six decisions. With some
help from Davidson's unusually
tight infield defense and a strong
wind blowing toward home

runs barely were enough to win
as Cole retired the last Citadel
batter with tying and winning
runs on base.

In the second encounter, Dav-
idson’s infield made up for its
strong play in the: first game
by allowing Citadel three un-
earned runs, but the Citadel de-
fense was even more pourous,
giving the visitors five unearned
runs and an 8-4 victory.

‘Cat starter Howard Bryan

five hitter. striking out six and
walking only one, Dick Snyder

plate with two hits each,

The Wildcats enter tonight's
