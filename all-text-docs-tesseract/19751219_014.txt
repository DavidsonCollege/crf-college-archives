Conference eyes possible members

By PAUL BANTA
Staff Writer

The
held its annual winter meeting
last week in Charlotte. The
purpose of the meeting was to
discuss internal matters and
to review league policies.

The most important matter
discussed was that of possible
new members to the confe-
rence, which shrinks to seven
schools in June when the
University of Richmond be-
comes an independant.

Commissioner Ken Ger-

Southern Conference:

mann announced that a num-
ber of schools have expressed
interest in joining the confe-
rence, although he admits,
that the degree of interest
varies among the different
schools.

As a result of last week’s
meeting, the member schools
decided to send a committee to
visit interested institutions
during the months of January
and February, and to report
on these schools at the spring
meeting on May 7 in Green-
ville, North Carolina.

The Commissioner empha-

sized that any new school or
schools entering the confe-
«rence must have Division I
football programs. ‘‘Football
is imyportant to the Confe-
rence, and its being strong
keeps the Conference strong,”’
Commissioner Germann
stated.

The winter visits are going
to be centered around three
schools, although others may
be considered. The three
schools to be most strongly
considered in replacing Rich-
mond are Western Carolina,
the University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga, and Marshall
University. The Conference is
hopeful that a decision will be
made at the May 7th meeting.

Commissioner Germann
said that he did not feel that
the loss of Richmond would be
a deathblow to the conference,

and he pointed to a renewed
spirit of unity in the confe-
rerice, the rise in the degree of
competition, and the improve-
ment of the conference’s finan-
cial situation as examples of
the Southern Conference’s sta-
bility.

As a result of the meeting,
the Commissioner announced
that the final game of the
Southern Conference Toura-
ment on March 4th will be
televised regionally by an
independant producer. He also
announced that 13 student
tickets will be available. The
1976 soccer schedule was also
set.

Instead of a division format
as before, the seven teams will
play a six-game round-robin
schedule in which each team
will play three home games
and three away games.

Soos led all scorers with 19

po

ints, followed by Sherrill

with 14. Morrison and Kat
Morton led the Cattes’ board
corps with nine bounds each;
Matheny with eight and Sher-
rill and Soos with seven each
helped considerably. Clark led
Catawba with 12 points and 13
rebounds, and Bradshaw and
Sherry Garner also chipped in
a dozen points.

“The key to the game was

our defense and rebounding,”

commented Janaro.

“Renee

and Donna both played a fine
game.’’ Added Schmader,
“The back line of our 2-1-2

defense

(Matheny, Sherrill,

and Morton) played extremely
well. Matheny played proba-
bly her best defensive game.

“Catawba had several good

outside shooters, and they
never gave up,”’ said Schma-
der. ‘‘We were never able to
put them away, but the vic-
tory is definitely a credit to
our team.”

The win gives the Cattes a
record of 1-2. The team
playing next at Converse on
January 8 and hosts High
Point the following night.
