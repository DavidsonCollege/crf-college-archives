Dad’s Day...

A great deal has been said regarding
Dad's Day elsewhere on this page but
we would like to add our word of wel-
come to the more official ones from the
administration and the sponsors of the
attain.

At press time there was no accurate
indication of the exact number of par-
ents expected, as the majority would not
Know until practically the last moment
Whether it would be possible tor them to

Its sponsors Voiced the hope and the
strong expectation that a large number
would find it possible to surmount the
‘prevailing difficulties and put in their

appearance atthe celebration,

following the success of the Mother's
Day festivities of last spring it would
bea shame it only a small number of the
Dads would be able to enjoy the full and
representative program planned in their

honor,

The importance-of the guests certainty

needs no emphasis: to those who stop to
think of who backs their student ca
reers. Let us all join, therefore, in
showing the most important group of
Davidson supporters the time of their
lives.

Scholarship .. .

The announcement — of fraternity
scholarship averages brings to light an
interesting fact about the school year
1941-42, a fact fraught with a certain
amount of embarrassment,

Records prove that the highest aver-
age. that of the Beta Theta Pi group
(1.587 or an approximate numerical
grade of 83) does not overlap the low-
est average for the year 194041. The
lowest for that period was 1.608.

The drop of the highest last year
from the top mark of the preceding
period was half a literal grade--from
I} to C--or a lowering of .5 according to
the point system--2.005 to 1.587.

The fact is—and we must face the
facts in these days—that Christmas
holidays this year will not be at all
what they used to be. Why? Sim-
ply because almost all girls’ schools
are having extended holidays be-
ginning on the fifteenth of Decem-
ber and ending on the fifteenth of
January.

Have you examined the catastro-

phic implications of this month-long _

holiday? In former years Davidson
studs have arrived home at about
the same time as the ladies—yet,

before students from other men’s

schools. The advantages of such a
situation incalculable. The
girls, tresh their respective
convents, would arrive home hungry
for men and certainly ready for a
rollicking gay time. Who were at
home ta rceeive them with open
arms? Davidson men! Davdgsonians

have the femmes dated up for the
rest of the holidays. Indeed, in their
respective ‘communities Davidson
men during the holidays have been
the declared envy of all other col-
lege men,

But, alas! We are now at war.
During these days of. strife the
male collegian is playing a losing
game to the uniform anyhow. We
are unable to explain it, but at the
mere mention of a uniform a young
lady loses all her sensibilities. Now,
when the uniformed men will have
the jump anyhow, due to the earlier
holidays for girls, Davidson men—
"yea—all college men will be left
completely in the cold,

Usually “By-Lines” has some

With The Staff

By JIM STIMSON

Elsewhere in this paper is an an-
nouncement of the full plans for the
Dads’ Day program. This program
gives a schedule of the week-end
events which our fathers will see
and take part in during their brief
visit to the campus, This program
will enable our dads to revive their
college days in a more modern. and
better developed setting.

Yet the-inauguration of Dads’
Day at Davidson will not mean
much to the sons unless they put
something into this new program.
The program, no matter how well
‘planned, can be monotonous. Ojten
Davidson students have — griped
about a change—or innovation in
the college program, thinking that it
is not worth while. Such incidents
have proved the fact that what we
get out of a thing depends upon
what we put into it. Have we all
made an earnest endeavor to make
our fathers feel that we want them
to be here for the week-end?

Dr. Cunningham has stressed that
the fathers should be invited as
guests of the students themselves,
more than guests of the college in
general, This may be the last op;
portunity that many fathers and
sons will have of being together for
a_yisit of-father to son on the cam-
pus. If this first affair is successful,
it might be an annual affair, but
present world conditions will prob-
ably prohibit a permanent Dads’
Day each year at Davidson. ~

Students are also taking a lead in
this program as well as the college
officials. A committee from the Y.
M.C.A, the
faculty committee in making plans
for the week-end. This student com:

sibility has seen the value of the
new idea ahd are interesting in see-
ing a successful Dads’ Day.

Last’ spring the students and
their mothers respondéd well to the
inauguration of the Mothers’ Day
at Davidson, and this idea proved
to be a Success. Both of these events
are new to the Davidson campus,
but they have been popular annual
events at other colleges and univer-
sities all over the country. A few
years ago an_article—appeared—or
the editorial page of the Davidson-
ian, suggesting that weyhave a Dads’
Day on our campus. Now the answer
to this article has come.

It is the responsibility of all ‘of
us to show our interest in order
to have a successful week-end.
Whether our fathers come or not,
we can help another- boy show his
father a good time. Let us all put
something into this: new event on
our campus, What we get out of it
depends upon what we put into it.
and what, our dads get out of it
depends, upon what we Put into it.
Let us all give dad a big time. He
is the man we love most.
