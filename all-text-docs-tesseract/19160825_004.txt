FACULTY NOTES. BLANKET FEE.

The following letter apropos the
blanket fee was recently mailed the old
as- well as to prospective new students,

Acting on the hearty and practically
unanimous request of the entire. student
body, based on an action taken entirely
on their own initiative, the Trustees re-
cently passed a resolution establishing
a Blanket Fee, payable as other college
fees to the College Treasurer.

This fee covers certain campus activi-
ties of the Student Body, and is in-
tended to stop the repeated canvasses of
the students in the interest of these ac-
tivities,

While the fee increases by a small
sum the fixed charges, it reduces by a
considerable amount the actual cost to
the students. Especially is this true of
the new students who, it is found, almost
invariably subscribe to all these forms
of campus activities.

The Fee is made up as follows:
Ticket to all athletic games on hill $1.75
Y. ML. C. AL ow. ee ec eee
Student Body Fee
Davidsonian (weekly paper) ...
Magazine (quarterly magazine)

The results of this fee are believed to
be in part:

1. Saving of money.

2. Freedom from the annoyance of
canvassers.

3. Better financing and success of
the students’ own activities.

4. Every student interested and par-
ticipating in student activities with con-
sequent increase in college spirit and in
all-round development.

As this fee is solely in the interest of
the students and at their request, the
authorities hope that the parents will
cheerfully agree and conform to the rule.
The fee will be collected in September,
and please remember that the net result
will be the saving of money to the in-
dividual.

This is a Junior or Senior elective,
and is intended for those students who
expect to be interested in church work
of whatever kind, no matter what voca-
tion in life may be chosen. For the pres-
ent this course will not be open to can-
didates for the ministry who expect to
take a full seminary course. Such stu-
dents will get an enlarged course in the
same subjects when they go to the semi-
nary. .

It is a well known fact that laymen
generally are becoming more and more
interested in the church courts and
church activities, but are greatly handi-
capped by ignorance in the fundamentals
of Church Government, Church History
and Presbyterian Doctrine.

After wide conference with many
ministers and church officers this course
is introduced with the hope that a num-
ber of students will find it helpful. It
will be grouped under the History and
Philosophy group and will be taught by
Dr. C. M. Richards.

NEW MEN WELCOMED

fit both to yourself and to those whom
you serve, and will give a better insight

to serve even as He did while here on
earth.

An effort will be made to have some-
thing for every man to do who can give
the time to it during the year, and each
of you is urged to participate in the
work.

With best wishes for a successful
year of college work and again assuring
you of our desire to help you wherever
possible.

THE ALUMNI GYMNASIUM.

1 regret that because of conditions
over which I have had no control, the
new gymnasium has not been started.
It will be begun this fall, however, and
pushed through to completion as rapidly
The delay has enabled us
to mature our plans, and it is expected
that a better building will result. The

two items demanding our first consid-
eration will be a splendid swimming, pool

and the main gymnasium floor large

enough for our needs.
