First married man—‘*Who are you
working for?” :
Second married man—“Same people—
wife and children,”
I lost my canary yesterd 1,
“l flutter soon I heard:
He flew out of my ink bottle,
Bye-bye black bird.

Ist Prof. — “About the same as any
other explorer, enough material for a
lecture.”

Bud Guthery tells us that women and

Street cars are just alike; there'll alw ays |

be another one along, and if you wait

long enough the same one will be coming
back.

“Some people come here to sit and,

think, but I come to meditate and pon-
der.”

Dock Hende rson—“Doctor, my girl has
a slight impedient in her speech. Can't
you suggest some cure?”

Doctor—“Well, when if it most
noticeable?”

Henderson—“She can't say yes.”

Fresh—“Did you know Sam Belk had
to go to the infirmary this morning?”

Soph—“What’s the matter?”

Fresh—“The doctor said he'd be all
right before long: His mustache has just
sapped all his strength.”

Student -golfer—“What are you doing
out on the green this early?”

Prof, Golfer—“Oh, I just came out to!

It doesn’t take a crazy person to play golf,
but it helps.

A light headed cook who likes to spoon
can be expected to stir up things in any
home.

Riled Prof. — “You're worrying me to
death. I’m already wandering in my
min@.” :

Riled wife—“That’s all right, you won’t
go far.”

Fresh Peterson writes home to_ his
high school sweetheart: “Light of my
life, I’ve struck another match.”

The friends of L. D. Wharton, prom-
ising novelist and playwright, realizing
that this is his last year as a student, wish
to suggest a nom de plume for future use
in his literary career. They have unani-
mously agreed upon “Gautemala.”

Museum of Art while you were in Wash-

such pretty blonde locks as mine?”

Wilkerson—"E don't) know, What
did you give?”

She—‘Oh, I feel so flattered! Ronald
dear told me that I reminded him of a
girl on a magazine cover.”

Mother+—"Don't misunderstand him.
He means that he sees you once va

Some inventive genius might do well to
introduce a slicker with extra backs, so
that the wearer might display a new set
of pictures every time it rains.

The stenographer's oath, “By gum.”
Safety First
Compassionate mother—‘Why arc you
beating Willie like that, father? What

has he done now?”

Father—"‘Nothing, but you see he brings
home his report tomorrow, I have to
leave before ‘breakfast in the morning.”

Bradley—“And so you're going with a
salior are your” Don't you know that
they have girls in every port?”

She—"Well that’s no worse than you

One of our graduates of last year's

teaching, replied, “Chair nothing, why

We'll now be dismissed by singing that

familiar anthem, “They called him ton-

. FRESHMAN CAPTAIN

captain for the Freshman basketball team,
C. R. Pritchett was chosen to lead the Wild-
kittens this season. Pritchett, who hails
from Reidsville, played on the team that won
the state high school championship three
years ago. Stationed at forward, he is one |
of the best shots and one of the most ver- |
satile men on the team. At the Wake For-)
est game which the Wildkittens won by a
score of 43-29, Pritchett was high scorer for |
both teams with 18 points to his credit. The |
Freshmen have won both.of their games thus
far and indications are that they will have a
most successful séason.

[Meeting a train in the Union station]

You are an experienced smoker

and you know your brand!

YOU’RE an experienced smoker.
You know good tobaccos. You
know taste and fragrance.

And you insist on the best —
that’s Camels. Only the primest

tobaccos grown are good enough

for you—the experienced smoker.

Whatever you do you are going to
do right, if you know it.

If Camels weren’t the best, they

would not be far and away the
first. If Camels weren’t quality
supreme, they would not be the
overwhelming preference of smok-

ers who have tried every brand.

Your taste tells you the tobacco
difference in cigarettes and you’re
going to smoke the best. Your

advice to others is — “Have a

Camel!”
