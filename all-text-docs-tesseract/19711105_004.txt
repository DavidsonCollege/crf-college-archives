A Four Day Work ‘Week

First we ask that the student compact all of the in-
formation, ideas, and concepts that he has learned into
a single examination. Then we decide that this compact
resume of true knowledge will be worth as much as 40%
of the evaluation of the course. And then we decree that
40%. of the course will be wrapped up in four days.

We do not mean to suggest that students should be
given a two or three week examination period. What we
do suggest is that the examination schedule adopted by
the EPC is unfair to the students.

There is a sizeable number of students involved in
the football program. On one of the four exam days they
will be playing football against The Citadel. Football players
are put in the position of three examinations in three days,
hardly a situation conducive to finding out precisely how
much of the material that halfback thas mastered.

Many other students find themselves faced with a
review and/or a lab practical the final two days of class
and no study days before they begin the four days of ex-
aminations.

We recognize that there are costs involved in keep-
ing the college open for the additional two or three days
required to extend examinations to Monday and Tuesday.

But the value to students which accrues from having
the time to prepare for the examinations far more than
offsets those costs.

The Lizard King

“I am the Lizard King, I can do anything.”

The latest trustee decisions concerning the by-laws
represent either a tremendous extent of unconscious ac-
ceptance or a marked disregard for the concerns of the
college.

Several provisions of the by-laws create essentially
one center of power, the administration and more specifi-
cally, the President. The students and the faculty have been
relegated to the role of advisors to the administration and
the Board of Trustees.

Any faculty member given tenure must be an active
member of a Christian Church.

This is a problem which has been discussed before
among students, faculty and administration. In the search
for excellence in prospective faculty members it would
appear that we are limiting ourselves unnecessarily with
this provision, particularly in South Asian studies.

If a faculty member leads a life which can be con-
sidered worth imitation by the trustees, it does not seeny
that they should be able to shove him into a church each
week as well.

The President shall have the authority either to stay
or to suspend the effectiveness of any action by the Fac-
ulty or by any Faculty or student the cn vee

The initial chartering, and also the continuance, of
any group or organization on the campus shall be subject
to the approval of the President.

These sections of the article concerning Faculty and
Student organizations follow the provision providing for
trustee chartering of the faculty dnd any student organi-
zation dealing with governance.

Although we would be far from identifying Presi-
dent Spencer as the latter day Caesar created the by-laws,
this article has placed all effective power with the Presi-
dent. It has taken the efficacy away from the faculty and
the student body.

If, for example, the senate were to pass a motion con-
cerning open dorms, the President could stay its effective-
ness with no recourse left for the students. Complete pow-
er for organizing campus activity rests with the President.

It is difficult to accept that the trustees have so little
confidence in the students or in the Christian faculty mem-
‘pers whom they have hired.

Morey And Crew Execute

I walked by the Carolina Inn
a couple of nights ago with
Ralph Peeples and noticed that
several people were arriving
for an organizational meeting
of the Davidson Young Repub-
licans. Ralph and I decided
we'd walk into the meeting and
observe what was going on.
When we walked in, of course,
a big hush came across the as-
sembled group, and it seemed
they were sure that either two
Communists or two devils had
appeared on their doorstep.

The Young Republicans meet-
ing was organized by George
Kaneklides, a junior, who in

-the past few years has changed

his views a good bit from pol-
itically conservative to a more
liberal stance. George, like so
many others, has realized the
war in Viet Nam is an inhum-
ane tragedy, he has seen other
examples of human tragedy
around him, and he has begun
to find ways of working for a
more human world.

George worked long and hard
to print announcement sheets
and posters for his meeting and
to arrange for the use of the
Carolina Inn. His stated pur-
pose was just to form a Re-
publican organization which was
more divergent and did not suf-
fer from only having within it
the arch-conservatives.

Ralph and I watched the
meeting carefully, and what I
am about to describe might be
called the ‘political rape of
George Kaneklides.” What hap-
pened was absolutely incredi-
ble.

George opened the meeting by
asking that a constitutional com-
mittee be formed so that fu-
ture procedures for the club
could be set up. All of the sud-
den, from one side of the room,
Bob Morey launched his hand
into the air and screamed, as
though he were Sen. Joe Mc-
Carthy, ‘‘Point of order! Point
of order! You can’t set up
a constitutional committee with-
out electing a Temporary Chair-
man for this organizational
meeting!’

Then, to Ralph and me, the
picture became clear. Bob Mo-
rey was up to his legalistic
tricks, and we knew that he was
getting ready to knife George
in the back.

We looked around the room
and noticed that all of Morey’s
cohorts were there, too: Mark
Deininger, (dressed in coat and
tie), Bill Eskridge, and Danny
Berry. Most of the arch-conserv-
ative national members of Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon were there, and
the ROTC department’s cadets
were wildly represented.

Danny Berry was nominated
for Temporary Chairman by
Mark Deininger, and he beat
George in the election because
the room was packed by Mo-
rey’s henchmen. Berry appoint-
ed Eskridge as parliamentarian,
and then a freshman member
of the SPE pledge class was
elected secretary.

At that point, Raiph and I]

could see that the control of
the new organization was lost
to the arch-conservatives. We
just waited for the next move.

The next move was the final
move for this meeting. and per-
haps the last move for the new
organization.

Bob Morey then darted his
hand up and said, ‘‘I move that
this meeting be adjourned until
a time at which the Temporary
Chairman calls another meet-
ing.” The motion passed when
all the SPE nationals and the
ROTC jocks voted for it.

Ralph and I were amazed.

We saw before us an incredible

legal maneuver. We felt that
this new organization is dead
because in all probability, the
move by Morey, Berry, and
Deininger set a means by which
Danny Berry won't have to call
any more meetings of the or-
ganization. And he_ probably
won't.

The works of this group of
idiots was really incredible. In
a short period of time they
destroyed every bit of the work
done by George Kaneklides. It
was an extremely inhumane
treatment, through legal action,
of another person, and we felt

Blistering Republican Coup

sickened by what we saw.

Particularly repulsive were
Bob Morey’s big, shining teeth
which appeared as he felt he
had defeated his enemy. He had
stalked his prey, attacked, and
left him behind to suffer and
die. The occasion brought back
to mind all the times I’ve heard
Morey talk about bringing peace
in Viet Nam through victory by
bombing the people of North
Viet Nam. I’ve seen him use
legal maneuvers without dis-
cretion or understanding of the
lives involved in the situations
he has been in, and I feel so
very sorry for him.

Beyond that, his cohorts —
Deininger, Berry, and others—
have shown themselves to be
likewise vainly insensitive in
lots of settings. They prey upon
others as though others’ per-
sonal lives do not matter.

Beyond all this, Ralph and I
know that in all such actions.
someone seems happy that he
has won, yet somehow, beneath
it all, there is a loser, too, and
he is the one who is so often
forgotten.

This is another part of the
immense tragedy of which we
are all a part.

Davidson Evils
Reflect Society

We all know that Davidson
is an evil place, Any given day,
any given student can list all
the bad things about Davidson.
So let’s accept this evil nature
as a fact at Davidson.

Everyone knows Davidson is
bad because it isn’t a good
cross-section of society. How
many Blacks do we have in pro-
portion to Whites? How many
students from lower financial
backgrounds do we have? How
many Jews do we have at
Davidson?

Everyone knows Davidson is
foo competitive. Students are
encouraged to compete against
each other for a grade rather
than’ to fearn for the sake of
learning.

Everyone knows Davidson stu-
dents. are too sheltered. They
don't have to be concerned with
food, shelter and money. In
most cases Davidson students
don’t even have to be concern-
ed about learning. Knowledge
is read off a professor's .parch-
ment lecture notes and rewrit-
ten in the student’s spiral note-
book.

Everyone knows that David-
son is a rut for most students.
They don't feel really motivated.
What they are learning doesn’t
seem relevant.

Everyone knows Davidson
pushes a student. There is very
little time for leisure. There is
very little time to meditate.

Everyone knows all these evils
plus many more like them.

So why is if that with so

much dislike for Davidson so
many of the students stay here
to graduate? It’s an easy ques-
tion to answer because every-
one knows that what is outside
of the Davidson environment is
just as evil as Davidson. David-
son reflects our society.

Everyone knows that when
they leave Davidson for a
weekend, or after graduating,
they will find themselves class-
ed within a society. They will
find themselves in a class which
is. anything but a good cross-
section of society.

Everyone knows that when
they leave Davidson they will’
continue to compete against
their co-workers for promotion
or higher salary.

Everyone knows that little in-
dividualism is possbile or ac-
ceptable outside of Davidson.
Life outside of Davidson is gen-
erally sheltered for Davidson
students.

Everyone knows that man’s
measure of worth depends on
how hard he works at his job,
how late he comes:home from
work and by how little free
time he has.

Life outside of Davidson will
be a rut for Davidson students.

1 would be close to last to
excuse Davidson for what it is.

I would be last in excusing
myself and others from leaving
this place upon graduation and
allowing our society to cast the
Same. pattern for Davidson to
follow in years to come,
