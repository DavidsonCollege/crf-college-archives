February 6, 1981—The Davidsonian—7

Deliberate Bulldog offense results in win as Wildcats lose another SC game

By STEVE SOUD

Some days you can’t shoot.
Some days you can’t rebound.
Some days you can’t play
defense. Some days you can’t
play offense. And then, about
once a season, there is the day
when you just can’t do any-—
thing —like last Wednesday.

Nothing went right for the
Wildcats, and a very opportun-
istic Citadel team took it to an
inept Davidson team to win,
72-58. It was the Citadel’s fifth
straight win over the Cats.

Few will deny that Davidson,
being upset for the first time
this season, was at its worst
against the Citadel. ‘‘We
weren't mentally prepared,”’
Coach Carl Clayton said to
explain team’s anemic 38.7%
field goal shooting. Senior Todd
Haynes agreed and added, ‘‘We
expected to win.”

Expectations were problem
number one. The team expected
a cakewalk through The Citadel
en route to victory number ten.
But there is absolutely no basis
for the prevailing attitude that
the Citadel ball club is a
pushover. The Bulldogs lost by
one point in the last ten seconds
against UT-Chattanooga. They
lost by a basket to Furman, and
beat Western Carolina by the
same margin.

The second problem cropped
up the day before the game,
when sophomore point guard
John Carroll sprained his ankle
in practice. Granted that back-
up guards Tom McConnell and
Tom Franz can bring the ball
upcourt and pass well, but

Carroll does so much more for
the offense and defense. ‘‘John
Carroll directs our offense
best,’’ Coach Eddie Biedenbach
said. ‘‘He understands it, and
he has the experience factor
over McConnell and Franz.”’
Gone was the team’s offensive
coordinator, and a player who
defends the opposition’s play-
makers as well as anyone in the
league.

Problem number three oc-
curred a couple of days before
the game, when 6’ 9”’ center
Jamie Hall explained to Bieden-
bach that he had to attend class
instead of going on the road
with the team. Hall walked
into the locker room about
twenty minutes before game
time, and consequently had
only ten minutes to warm up.
It’s hard for anyone, especially
Hall, to play under those con-
ditions. In fact, Biedenbach felt

that Carroll’s injury and Hall’s .

absense contributed to the
team’s poor mental attitude.

Problem number four was the
officiating, as the referees per-
formed more and greater feats
of visual inaccuracy. On two
similar plays at opposite ends of
the court, a Davidson player
would get called for the foul, a
Bulldog wouldn’t. A lot of those
‘‘fouls’”’ were purely judgmental
calls, but when the Citadel was
assessed for only 10 fouls in
forty minutes of basketball, one
can safely say that something
has gone wrong.

‘he Wildcats’ fifth problem
was the Citadel. “The Citadel
caused us to play the way we
did.’’ Biedenbach said. The

Bulldogs packed in a tight 2-3
zone that denied the ball from a
motionless offense. Biedenbach
again complained that his off-
ense wasn’t moving, saying
‘‘When you're not moving
you're not taking good shots.
You're in front of the defense.
You just don’t lunge at the
boards.”

With twelve minutes left in -

the first half, a 10-8 lead and the
ball, the "Dogs spread into a
four corner offense. Haynes
noted, “By delaying it, they cut
it to a 20 minute game,”’ and the
‘Cats didn’t have much of a
chance after that.

The spread offense by the
Citadel didn’t exactly spring
Davidson out of the shooting
doldrums either. ‘‘When we get
behind in a 2-3 zone, we'd like to
put in our shooters, but they
controlled the ball on offense,
and our players became preoc-
cupied with defense. When back
on offense, we weren't pre-
pared,’’ explained Biedenbach.

“The Citadel is a more dis-
ciplined team than we will ever
be, by nature of the student
that goes there,” he continued.
The discipline of the Bulldogs
helped them to slow the pace
down, and they took few bad
shots to put the at a 52.1% field
goal clip for the game. The
control also enabled them to
out-rebound the ’Cats 44-34 for
the game, 28-17 off the Wild-
cats’ offensive boards.

With the Conference race
heating up, Davidson can't
afford to lose any more games.
“We can’t take anyone in our
league lightly,’’ said Bieden-

Rifle team guns down conference opponents

The Wildcat Rifle team got
off to a quick start in December
with its first-ever victory in the
Western Carolina Conference
match.

The team’s season record
stands at 12-5. Being in two
conferences gives the squad
more exposure to competition.
Davidson riflers shoot in the
Southern Conference as well as
the Western Carolina Confer-
ence (WCC), a league composed
of regional rifle schools.

In the WCC, Davidson's
record of 7-0 gives it a good
chance to win the conference
title this year. However, team

captain Pat Stuart said, ‘Our
chances were really good for
winning the WCC. But our
leading shooter, George Hat-
field, left school, so it’s going to
be tough.’’ Stuart said he does
feel that the team will improve
on its third place finish in the
conference last year. ‘‘We’ve
still got a good shot at the
championship if some of the
freshmen come around.”’

Last weekend, the team faced
a tough N.C. State squad.
Davidson shot one of its better
of the year (1550) but was
overwhelmed by the N.C. State
team whose individual scores
average in the mid 500’s. Craig
Rice led Davidson with a 530;

~ Pat Stuart followed with a 522.

George Webster (520), Jim
Mashburn (504), and Steve
Lawrence (496) also shot well.
Two weekends ago, Davidson
shot against Marshall, UT-
Chattanooga, and East Ten-
nessee State, the number two-
ranked rifle team in the nation.
The scholarship-laden ETSU
team beat all comers. David-
son’s four-man score of 1998 left
them in third place, just behing
UT-Chattanooga but ahead of
Marshall.

Stuart said, ‘‘George Web-
ster has really been a surprise
lately. He’s shooting better
than ever. And Craig Rice, who
was away last year, is shooting
pretty well.”

Sophomore Doug Austin
placed well in a match against
VMI on January 17. Though
the team did lose to VMI, it put
forth one of its best scoring
efforts.

Other members of the team
are sophomore Elizabeth Bra-
zell and freshmen Jeff Tilbury,
Chuch Stevenson, Jeff Knud-
son. Obviously a young team,
the riflers are gaining important
experience this year while still

shooting well against stiff com-

petition.

The team is advised by the
ROTC department and coached
by Sergeant Ransom Cooper.

Davidson will compete in an
important WCC match this
weekend.

bach. That statement holds
particularly true with three
essential road games next on
the schedule. Within a one week
span, the team travels to UT-
Chattanooga, VMI, and Fur-
man, and winning two of those
three games could bring David-
son its first Southern Confer-
ence crown since the early 70’s.

That is easier said than done,
however. Since Biedenbach has
been coaching at Davidson, his
teams have won only three
games on the road. This season,
only about 20% of the Southern

(Mike Kehs)

Conference games have been
won away from home.

If the team should go on and
lose the remainder of its games,
fans would be satisfied. The
team ranks second in the NCAA
in free throw percentage
(76.7%), and with a record of
9-10 has already surpassed last
year’s team in the win column.

But the team is still the
conference leader with an ex-
cellent chance of taking it all. If
the team can win a pair of road
games, they can claim a confer-
ence championship.

Lady cagers lose two on
the road, stand at 1-13

Furman and UNC-Greens-
boro handed the Davidson wo-
men’s team a pair of losses to
send the team record to 1-13.

Despite poor team perform-
ance, the Cats have demon-
strated some stunning indiv-
idual play. Sophomores Mike
Frankhouser and Jeanne Wo-
mack are presently leading the
North Carolina Division III
women’s league in rebounding,
with Carol Heppner also among
the top ten. Frankhouser is the
high scorer in the state with an
average of 17 points per game.

The Furman Paladins, coach-
ed by former Davidson coach
Susie Roberts, defeated the
Cats 75-46 in an emotionally
packed game last Wednesday in
Greenville. Roberts took over as
head basketball coach this year.
Captain Kirby Owen said, ‘‘We
were looking forward to playing
our former coach. We hoped
that we would play well against
them.”’

Frankhouser led the scoring
with 18 points followed by
Womack with 12. All five
Davidson starters were coached
by Roberts last year. The Cats
committed only 18 turnovers, a

’ marked improvement in this

troublesome area. Field goal
percentage was low, 27.8%,
with the free throw percentage
slightly better at 41.4%. The
Cats pulled down 46 rebounds
during the contest.

In comparison, Furman shot >

44% from the floor and an
enviable 90% from the line,
while grabbing 50 rebounds.

The Cats were unable to

repeat their fine home perform-
ance against UNC-G earlier this
season as they lost 72-59 Mon-
day in Greensboro. The home-
court advantage was evident as
the red-hot Lady Spartans shot
47% from the field and 60%
from the line.

High scorer for Davidson was
Mike Frankhouser with 18,
followed by Jeanne Womack
with 12, Carol Heppner with 11,
and Kirby Owen with 10. This
was one of the few games where
scoring was well distributed.

Coach Dee Mays said, ‘‘At
times I see really outstanding
play by the team but we are not
consistent enough.” Field goal
percentage was stronger, 35%,
and free throws were notably
high at 64%.

The second half of the UNC-
G game showed impressive
play, especially from Jeanne
Womack. As Davidson's inside
game was revitalized by a spurt
of good play. The Cats were
down by 17 at the half and were
able to cut the deficit to 11
before succumbing to the Lady
Spartan’s outside shooting.

The next five games are
important. in that they are all

‘conference games. If the Cats ca

win some of the next few games,
they could enter the State
Tournament in better shape.
Even if wins continue to elude
them, Coach Mays feels confi-
dent that her team will enter the
State Tournament mentally and
physically prepared for a tough
fight. As captain Kirby Owen
says, ‘Our most important goal
now is to play well in our next
five games against conference
foes."’
