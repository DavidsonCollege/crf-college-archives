By JOHN JOHNSON

The sound of popping shoulder pads on the local football
field has died away for another year, but before the winter
sports of basketball, wrestling, and swimming completely take
over the spotlight let's glance back at the season.

One of the most outstanding features was the individual
performance of Captain Donny McRee

At the completion of the first two interfraternity tourna-
ments, flickerball and wrestling, the Kappa Sigs hold first
place with a 14 point margin over the second place Phi Delts.

ed by only three tenths of a point.

In rushing McRee had a net gain of 464 yards
averaging almost five yards a carry. Paul Barbee, the
sophomore surprise, had the best average at 5.2 but did
not have as high a net gain.

TD JAUNTS

McRee received nine kickoffs and carried them back for

334 yards including the spectacular 98-yard touchdown

jaunt against V.M.I. that electrified the packed homecoming

crowd. He also turned a punt return into a score against the
Citadel. Don Comer was the only other Wildcat to place high
in the punt return yardage.

The same two boys, McRee and Comer,

were the best

punters on the squad with the former again commanding a

sizable lead with a 36.6 yard average.

PITCHING PIGSKIN

Quarterback Dyke Little who fought all season with
Dick Belton for the starting position captured the only re-
maining crown. The Hickory senior
completed 28 passes for a net gain of
462 yards to lead the hurling. Belton,
top passer in the conference his junior
year, pitched the pigskin for less than
one-third of his record-setting totals of
last season.

LINE TOUGH

Lead by tackles Tom Lee and Dave Fagg and center Bill
Price the Wildcat line performed its mission well, under the
watchful eye and booming voice of Coach Pride Ratterree.
On the defense they reached their peak when they three times
held Richmond for downs while the Spiders were within
scoring distance of the goal.

The Cats finished with five wins, three losses and
one tie for a third consecutive winning season. Davidson,
long an underdog that usually had to be content with
“moral” victories, has since 1954 produced better records
than at any time since the 1920's and the credit must go

to Coach Bill Dole.

Hindered by the school's natural emphasis on scholarship |
he has sought out boys that are a credit to the college and}
made them into teams in which the students and alumni can

well be proud.

Before the game two Southern

new rules that have been adopted
for the incoming season. One of}
the most important of the
changes is that “dunking”
is no longer legal.

It was the old rules, how-
ever, and not the new ones
that plagued both squads all

whistles blew for violations

playing in the Richmond affair as
a result of V.P.I.’s decision to en-

NEXT ACTION

The Wildeats take on Catawba
in another home contest on De-
cember 4 and hope that they can
get off to a fast start, enabling
them to better last year’s 11-14
record.

Displaying reluctance to go out
on a limb, Coach Scott praised the
work of the freshman members of
the squad and said, “This is our
first test; it’s really too early to
make any predictions.”

Final Contest, 27-13

While steam-rolling Davidson in-

in Furman scores.

Seven completions netted
the Red and Black 98 yards,
four of which were by
Dyke Little and three by Dick
Belton. Bill Gramley was on
the receiving end of three con-
nections totaling 47 yards.

An effective offense compiled
an average of 4.5 yards per try
in the rushing department to go
with 50 yards via the airways to
give the victors a versatile attack.

With the aid of a 40 yard scor-
ing jaunt, Don McRee covered 63
yards in eight cracks in supplying

,the Wildeats with their only of-

fensive threat on the ground.
