Labor lawsuit against College begins

A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) complaint against
the College will be heard Monday at the Federal Courthouse in

Statesville.

The complaint charges the College with trying to “discourage
concerted activity among. its employees.” Three physical plant
workers claim they were unfairly disciplined by the College after
circulating a petition among other employees.

The NLRB filed the complaint August 7, 1979 after an

investigation by one of its field examiners.

Ken Chiles ’67 is the College’s legal counsel. NLRB lawyer Louis
Lesesne ’67 will represent the plaintiffs.

The hearing is open to the public.

Housing crunch hits many schools

(CPS) Students haps to
the New York Institute of’

Technology this past fall to find .
‘all the dorm rooms full. Event-

ually 27 of the students—all of
whom had dorm: room -reserva-
tions—had to be ‘‘temporarily”
housed in what the student
paper called ‘‘a YMCA-run
dorm in a prostitute-ridden
section of Manhattan,” a two-
hour. commute from campus.

Across the country at the
University of California-Berk-
eley, the situation was just as
bad, though students were

moved to temporary housing a

- relatively-short 20 minutes

away from: classes.

It’s happening between the
coasts, too: college dorm rooms
are filled to capacity and be-
yond. ‘‘Tripling’’— placing ‘
three students in rooms design-
ed for two—has become a
common practice, but still
hasn’t satisfied the surprising
student demand for on-campus
housing.

“Nearly all schools have
100% occupancy, if not more,”
notes Jerry Quick, president of
the Association of Colleges and-
University Housing Officers, a
group representing 550 admini-
strations. Quick says the dorm
shortage is the worst he’s ever
seen. Demand is at record
levels.

Housing officers are conse-
quently scrambling for more
space to accomodate students.
Quick claims one university had
to buy a monastery to convert
into housing, while two schools
in the South—one with too
many students, one with vacant
dorm space—merged because of
housing concerns.

Most housing officers end up
sending students to nearby

Places as dissimilar as the
University of Tennessee, Clem-

State University also counted
on too many dorm cancella-
tions.

Most of them resorted to

renting ‘‘temporary” housing’

for students until study and
storage space in on-campus
buildings could be hastily con-.
verted into living space.

There wasn’t enough study

management complained of

ents.

Housing executive Quick
dwaells on the convenience and
popularity of dorm living as
reasons for the record demand
for on-campus space, but then
readily notes the dramatic in-
crease in the costs of living off
campus may well have driven
students into the dorms.

Jerry Buford at the U.S.
Dept. of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) says
there’s no study of the cost of
off-campus housing, but esti-
mates rentals in ‘“‘communities
with demographics similar to
what you’d expect in university
situations”’ have risen ‘‘more
than 10%” since fall 1978.

Large university towns,
moreover, tend to feel the

political influence of academics, .

and sometimes that leads to

strict zoning and building

standards. Those tough stand-
ards have, according to Nor-
man, Oklahoma City council-

man Charles Schindler, brought
off-campus housing develop- -

ment in Norman to a standstill.
‘Existing housing units can

~thus charge more, and get away

with it.

nances: have also pushed rents

ico °gtudents to° stay in

Yet most administrators
won't build more dorms. “In
one, two, three years, the
enrollment downturn is going to
be significant,’’ Quick explains.
“None of us are rushing out to
build more dorms. We just
won't have the students to jput
in them.

That also means there won't
be students to pay for them. On
Quick’s own Central Michigan
University campus, there are
400 students to whom Quck
could sell dorm space this year. .
“I could fill another dorm this
year. I could get it built in two
years. By then I won’t have
anybody to put in it. Now how
in hell am I going to pay for it?’’

The University of Kentucky
was the only school Quick could
remember that was brave
enough to build a new dorm this
year. Davidson in North Caro-
lina has decided to build two
small dorms—at a modest cost
of $1 million—to open in Fall,
1981. Arizona State is also
applying for a government loan
to build a new residence hall.

Yet the vast majority of
administrations maintain con-
servative housing policies, even
to the point of ignoring a HUD
loan program from campus
housing. A full $69 million is
earmarked for helping colleges
build new or remodel old hous-
ing. Only 400 schools—out. of
some 3400 in the U.S.—have
bothered to apply for the
money. ;

They figure, according to

- Quick, the overcrowding is ‘‘a

short-term problem.” Despite a
threatened student lawsuit

charging Towson State with

breaching its housing contract
with its students, most stu-
dents are coping with the

situation quietly. Quick has
<heard.‘hardly any” complaints
/ from ‘the students in what he
calls’ expanded occupancy

areas.’
“But there may come a point

John McDow says his enroll-
ment looks solid for the next

. few years, but frets the “‘num-

ber may decrease because of the
housing situation.” '
