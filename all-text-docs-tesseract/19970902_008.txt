8 = -_—_, THE DAVIDSONIAN

Iread an article in the Charlotte
Observer the other day about a
young woman who has “grown up
right under our noses.” At the age of
17, Chelsea Clinton is preparing to
venture out of the White House for
the first time on her own. In Sep-
tember she begins classes as a fresh-
man at Stanford

Chelsea made the right choice

how miserable would it have made
us all! Just think, you would have
undercover agents, snipers so to
speak, all over campus. Then the
news shows would come. Hard
Copy and The National Enquirer
would be contacting you on a daily
basis - if not knocking on your door
- to get any piece
of information

pus was that
Davidson had
made Chelsea’s short list. Several
people swear they spotted her dash-
ing across campus ‘one Saturday
morning in the fall. In addition, a
story surfaced about a woman whose
roadside trash container had been
pushed away from the curb of her
Main Street abode as a precaution-
ary measure by the Secret Service.
The truth of the matter remains that
the college never acknowledged an
official visit by the President’ s
daughter.

Regardless, what amazed me
was the excitement surrounding the
possibility. of Chelsea Clinton at-
tending Davidson College. I mean,

to. be having
fun? Does ‘she’
miss Socks? What color is hertooth-
brush? Did she really participate in
the body painting hall mixer?

A worse scenario of course
would occur if Chelsea was actu-
ally your roommate. The FBI would
have an immense file on you before
you graduated, and you would prob-
ably feel quite awkward when her
mom and dad called to see how she
was doing. What if Chelsea was a
downright slob? Do you call RLO
and tell them that you are sick of
having a psycho roommate that
steals all of your cookies and leaves
dirty laundry on the floor, or do you
keep silent and not complain, know-

ing that your conversation is being
recorded and sent directly to impor-
tant people in Washington? Or per-
haps even more awkward, what if
Chelsea brought a boy home to
“sleep over?” Do you excuse your-
self politely or do you pretend to
fall asleep, hoping to discover some
piece of knowledge that you can
sell to A Current Affair for several
million.

Imagine Chelsea Clinton on
Patterson Court. Is that possible?
Could you ever picture Chelsea
going to “Pimp and Ho,” or “Any-
thing For Money.” That scares me.
Try envisioning Chelsea getting into
afight at the Outpost. It just can’t be
done.

I guess I am just trying to say
that Chelsea just didn’t belong at

‘Davidson. This place is too small

and I hate to say it, but in a strange
way too perfect for such a disrup-
tion.

I’m thanking all my lucky stars
that she’s not here, not being my lab
partner, not scoring a touchdown
on the flickerball field, and not run-
ning next to me with her shirt off on
Self-Selection night,

Thank you God.

A salute to the men in brown

In the wake of the recent UPS
strike, I asked myself why strikers
strike.

The drivers made $20 an hour,
they could look forward to a nice
pension, and most of them had great
benefits.

Sull, these 160,000 people de-
cided to simultaneously stop work-
ing, lose their salary for however
long, and risk their standard of liv-
ing for something they believed was
right. They wanted their fellow
part-time workers, who mostly
worked 35-39 hours a week and
were paid eight to nine dollars, to
have better pay and the opportunity
to become full-time.

UPS paid their drivers well but
refused to treat their mail sorters
similarly. Like many other compa-
nies, they would rather hire. many
part-time workers and pay them less
instead of hiring fewer full-time
workers and pay them more. oe

Let’s stop attributing our be-
liefs and behavior to the teachings
of “THE FAITH” and instead call
them what they really are: thoughts
and acts of bigotry. Truly Chris-
tians are acquiring a pompous,
smug, hypocritical stereotype which
is totally the opposite of Jesus’s
teachings.

Fear is the prime motivator—
fear of those who think or appear
different. If everyone were just like
everyone else, we would live in a
stagnant world without new ideas
and inventions.

There would be no one to chal-
lenge our ideas, no one forcing us to

think, no one forcing us to form our

own opinions.

Religion is a volatile issue, as
is sexual preference, and when these
two issues collide, the world be-
comes downright ugly.

In my county of Greenville,

mer of 1996. Unfortunately, asmall-
minded religious interpretation won.

stead of providing better jobs to
more people.
Since the workers know that
‘before agreeing to work, it is only
fair for UPS not to give them raises.

But that question is a secondary
one. :

It does not take away from the
fact that these workers gave up a
very secure life for something they
believed was right.

We should admire that.. The
will to challenge authority is now
notas prevalent as it was in, say, the
1960s. ,

True, things are better now.

In order to understand these
events, an explanation of Greenville

The county is one of paradoxes.

mainly by vocal right-wing reli-

But we do know that even pas-

In the UPS strike, it's nice to «

Council members were threatened
with the loss of votes in the.forth-
coming election, and two of these
members turned their backs on their
beliefs to vote for this resolution.
This is proof that even the least

During the summer of 1996,
both Greenville and Spartanburg
counties drafted an anti-gay resolu-
tion; only the county council of
Greenville was ignorant enough to
pass it.

The county was, and is, com-
pletely divided on the issue, but the
Christian Coalition was unified.

at me and my skimpy summer sal-
ary and how I could not possibly
have gained any valuable experi-
ence for my future career. Well,
you're half-right.

Being a camp counselor this
past summer, I believe, was one of
the best decisions Ihave ever made.

_ TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1997.

~My summer experience

enough to work as a camp counse-"

everyone who had a high-paid in- _

to Eric, I found a camp that fit me
perfectly. Camp Glenkirk employs
what is known as small-group
camping. Two counselors, one
male and one female, lead a small
group of no more than 14 kids.
Instead of the typical summer
camp, where a group breaks up
(some do archery while others play
badminton and others make bead
necklaces), all activities are done
in a group. Glenkirk also keeps it
simple, which leaves room fora lot
of creativity.

also got to be outdoors all summer
and work with over 20 other col-
lege-age students who care about
many of the same things that I do.

Back in February, I thought
along the lines of many other col-
lege students. . I believed that I
needed an internship in my field to
help get a jump on my future. I
thought I'd try to. find’an intern-
ship in Charlotte and live at
Davidson. So I moseyed on over
to the Career Center and attended
a workshop or two and poked
around on their computer. I found
a few which seemed interesting
and wrote down the information. I
figured I’d send out some resumes
and cover letters over spring break.
So, when [left with my apartment-
mate, Eric, for his home in Alex-
andria, I was prepared to find a

summer job.

However, while in Virginia,
Eric needed to speak with the di-
rector of the summer camp at which
he had worked the previous three
summers, and he let me tag along.
Well, I ended upinterviewing with
the director that day and was told I
could work there that summer.

I never ended up sending out
those resumes. I decided that an

truly enjoy and value. And, thanks

dren of all different backgrounds
and helps them to learn to get along
and work with one another. I be-
lieve teaching concepts such as
this to children is much easier than
teaching adults already set in their
ways.

Being a counselor definitely
was not easy. I dealt with a wide
range of problems. My campers
ranged from fourth to 12th grade,
so I had to deal with everything
from a camper who messed his
pants at least once a day to home-
sickness to guys trying to sneak off
to the girls’ cabin.

Now I realize that camp coun-
seling is not for everybody — I
know people who would rather not
work with children or prefer to
stay inside. | don’t think there’s
anything wrong with office intern-

experience and can be very educa-
tional. I do believe, though, that
one can gain just as much experi-
ence and education doing some-
thing such as camp counseling.
Some people blow it off as a non-
serious summer job that is easy
and is of little worth.

But from my experience, I can
promise you thatat the right camp,
being a camp counselor will be, as
Eric once told me,.“‘the toughest
job you'll ever love.”

sion, the religious minority to rid
Greenville County of the sinful gays

growth of our county?

You can’t have your latte and

This resolution is a shot in the
foot, better yet, the head. It is at
least an embarrassment but is at the
most a foreshadowing of the battles
that will be waged during our pro-
fessional lifetime.

This opinion sets a precedent.

for pétentially closed societies and
goes against the Bill of Rights and
the Constitution.

Our society is. working toward
plurality and acceptance, not rejec-
tion. We are trying to bury segrega-
tion—let’s not resurrect it in the
name of sexual preference rather
than skin color. '

- This anti-gay resolution is
merely a thinly-veiled attempt at
segregating the queers and “dykes

too

from the righteously-minded.
Please be aware of the senti-
ments around you and to what those
sentiments may lead. Our country
is trying toend discrimination. Why

must humans feel threatened by the

very quality that makes this world
real and interesting—diversity?

One more word to those who
will call me blasphemous and may
be feeling a rush of smug pity for
me because I do not understand “the
ways of the Lord.”

Turn your finger on yourself.
It’s time to question from where
your beliefs come, the Bible or your
own fear of those who do not fit
your tight little mold.

How can you condemn soine-
one else when you are yourself a
sinner and a hypocrite?

Let’s not close our minds to
ideas and beliefs that may chal-
lenge our image of the world. Lis-
ten while you argue, and allow oth-

_ ers to have opinions that pilter from

your own.
