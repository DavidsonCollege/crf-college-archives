Dibble’s effoets failed and the
Sackett motion eventually re-
ceived the necessary two-thirds
majority required for proposed
constitutional amendments.

Constitutional a m end ments
may also be proposed by a pe-
tition of 50 members of the Stu-
dent Body: to this avenue the
editor turned.

Immediately after the meet-
ing, Dibble drafted his defeat-
ed proposal into a petition and
collected ‘‘about 150°' names.
He informed President Jackson
of the existence of the petition
but withheld formal’ presenta-
tion.

Following a meeting of the
Student-Faculty Conference
Committee Thursday afternoon.
Jackson stated, “I intend to ask
the student body to reject the
proposed amendment to the Stu-
dent Body Constitution with the
stiputation that a new amend-
ment be proposed after Christ-
mas.”

Explaining his dissatisfaction
with the presently proposed
amendment, Jackson pointed
our the “weaknesses in the pres-
ent proposal and the probléms
it presents. The most ob-
vious flaw is that you can sit in
your trunk and do anything.
Other flaws are that the inter.
pretations and implications of
the rule are unclear.”

Both the amendment now be-

fore the student body and the
tentative amendment to be pro-
posed later have the end of al.
lowing liquor in trunks, Jack-
son said, but the new proposal
is much clearer in its wording.
Under the new proposal, ex-
plained Jackson. “possession in
trunks—open or closed—would
be legalized," because the
trunks, acording to the amend.
ment, would not be on campus.
Jackson emphasized, however,
that the new oroposal would
hold “only with regard to pos-
session of liquor: drinking in
trunks would still be illegal.’’

The ambiguities and unclear
wording of the presently pro-
posed amendment will be re.
viewed, Jackson said, and the
proposal for a new definition of
canibus will be presented in as-
sembly Monday.

The new amendment will
have to be proposed in accord-
ance with the procedure stated
in the Student Body Constitu-
tion which provides for a pro:

Applications are now available
for the 1965 newspaper intern-
ship program of The Newspa-
per Fund. Selected applicants
are awarded a $500 scholarship
upon the completion of three
months of full-time newspaper
work.

Last summer four Davidson
students participated in the pro-
gram, which is supported by
grants from The Wall Street
Journal. They are Tom Craig,
Rick von Unwerth, Buck Lawri-
more and Tom Loflin.

Craig, a junior from Spartan-
burg. S.C., worked for the
Spartanburg Journal. He cover-
ed the Republican National Con.
vention for a group of Carolina
papers and is now in France
on the Davidson Junior-Year-
Abroad program.

Lavwrimore, a junior from
Georgetown,.S. C., was a report-
er for The Charleston (S. C.)
Evening Post. He has been a
reporter for THE DAVIDSON-

artist did all the work himself,
exhibiting 37 of his works in
Raney Library in August.

The show drew an unprece-
dented 2700 people and Jackson
put in several weeks of 12
hour days. Aside from the in-
valuable experience, he sold
four paintings for $600. A Dur-

UNC sculpture professor Robert
Howard (story in current Time
magazine) was another winner.

Jaékson reports that he works
in the studio ‘‘about ten hours

man with the intention of study-
ing abroad during his junior
year; hopefully he plans to do
graduate work at Yale and
eventually teach.

Said Herb, ‘‘An artist at Dav-

tain an artist in residence he
might as well live in Dr. Houch-

went on to make the point that

What is Jackson trying to ex-

pressed in the program to his
one-man show.

“Since it is impossible to rep-
resent nature completely. every

. attempt becomes an abstraction.

It is even less possible to seize
essence; one can only hope for:
an intuitive interpretation. Form

Oavidsonian Feature Writer

How would you like to see Europe on $15
a week? Travel from Paris to Copenhagen
for $19 or from London to Istanbul for $40?
This and much. much more is available to
students thanks to Education Travel, Inc., a
subsidiary of the National Student Associa-
tion.

At Open End Wednesday night Larry Han-
del, a director of ETI, was on the campus to
tell us about these and other ‘‘good deals”
ETI provides.

ETI has three main divisions: tours for
American students. tours for foreign students,
and Independent services. It is in this last
division that students can find answers to
their travel problems.

The keys to all those great prices are a
book and a card. The book is Work, Study,
Travel Abroad, written by Handel himself,
and the card is a National Student Associa-
tion I. D. card.

GUIDEBOOK

Work. Study. Travel Abroad is a student's
guidebook to Europe. It lists all the possible
travel plans, ways of financing the trip, and
what to do and where to go in Europe to
meet other students. According to Handel. this
last will be no problem at all. because ‘“‘there
is an international student community. You
don't know about it, because you haven't been
there, but you'll see it when you go.”

The student I. D. card is the real worker
on a student tour. It can save the traveling
student money in the areas of transportation,
room and board. and entertainment. Stated
Handel. ‘Always show the card. You never
know when you'll get a discount."’ Special
charter flights are available to the owner of
a card, which costs a dollar.

In addition, railway travel in most coun-
tries is half-priced. and movies, tneaters,

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1964

museums, etc., give large discounts to card-
holders. In fact here in the United States a
eard-holder can get discounts from certain
hotel chains, night clubs, and travel dormi-
tories.

WORKING ABROAD

Handel proceeded to cover working
abroad. There are. he told his audience, three
main ways. The most commonly used are
work camps, which have no language re-
quirement and require no skills. The other
two are trainee jobs and Government Em-
ployment Agency jobs which require some
training and some knowledge of the language.

Jobs, it seems. are not hard to come by,
but, stated Handel. you can't pay for your
trip that way: “I know. I tried. I'm Jewish.
If I can't do it. you can't!”

STUDY ABROAD

Finally Handel covered study abroad. The
two ways of studying abroad used most.often
by students, he said, were American Univer-
sity programs. and European summer schools.
The work, he said, is easy (no homework, no
exams, the lowest grade is a ‘'C’’), and the
whole thing is wonderful.

In DAVIDSONIAN interviews Handel and
Chuck Matthews, campus coordinator of Na-
tional Student Association projects, explained
Davidson's relationship to these programs.
The Student Council pays $30 a year for Da-
vidson to belong to the NSA. ETI, being an
NSA subsidiary, thus makes itself available
for Davidson student use.

A student travel agency is now being set
up in the Union, where information and copies
of the ETI guidebooks will be available. So
if you're planning on traveling, working, or
studying in Europe. make sure you see what
ETI has to offer. A sample? Four full months,
including England. Scotland, France, Ger-
many, Egypt, Israel, and Scandinavia. The
price? $900.

Local Integration Fuss
Draws College Interest

Twelve residents of north-
ern Mecklenburg County,
including one Davidson Col-
lege professor, appeared
before the Charlotte-Meck-
lenburg Board of Education
Wednesday to discuss pro-
posed plans for relieving
over-crowded conditions at
Torrence-Lytle School, an
all-Negro, 12-grade institu-
tion serving the area be-
tween Davidson and Char-
lotte.

The board had _ reportedly
planned to move the 250 junior
high students out of Torrence-
Lytle to be absorbed the three
other junior high schools serv-
ing the ‘north area”.

“The concern of Davidson
College,” said an administra-
tion official. ‘is with the facul-
ty families and other towns-
people of Davidson. We hope
that the school board will pro-
ceed with due caution and con-
sideration in this matter.”

The group of citizens present
at the Wednesday meeting who
represented Davidson and other
North Mecklenburg communi-
tes asked that high school stu-
dents—not junior high—be given

the fraternity speaker for the
semester. a program initiated
by the Senior Class President.
William McK. Wright, Assist-
ant Dean of Students at DePaul
University, will honor the cam-
pus in that capacity,

Of further concern to the
group was the current fraternity
situation here on campus. They
sought advice to bring back to
the Student Council Social and
Fraternity Committee.

In trying to strengthen the
campus IFC, advice was sought
on what areas needed the most
improvement. One obvious
weakness. according to Sack-
ett, was the lack of a local IFC
publication.

He further opined that the Da-
vidson IFC was one of the
strongest in our classification
(campuses with 15 or fewer fra-
ternities) and stood a chance at
a national award.

The national award. the ‘‘Iron-
man’s Trophy”, is a 400 pound
iron man standing with arms
outstretched. As one observer
noted, “It looks something like
a big Oscar — only different.”

accordance with the spirit of the
student proposal.

The modified rule adopted by
the faculty stipulated that the
Student Council should amend
their rules to bring them into
harmony with the faculty rule,‘
and that they should agree to
support and enforce the amend-
ed rules. This the council has
done in proposing the amend-
ment to the Student Body Con-
stitution and in adopting the
statement of policy on enforce-
ment.

Following the Faculty’s re-
vision of its rules, President
Martin expressed his apprecia-
tion for the “fine spirit of co-
operation which the student body
officers demonstrated in pro-
posing an enforceable rule.”
Jackson also stated that he
wished “‘to thank the faculty
and the administration for
their co-operation and consid-
eration in this matter.”

He presented his request in the
form of petitions which the
board accepted unanimously but
only as information.

The main contention of the
group was that there would be
a severe disciplinary problem
with junior high-age group. “‘A
massive consolidation of the
schools would present great
problems,” Ward said.

Dr. Reginald Hawkins, a
Negro dentist who has been ac-
tive in Civil Rights movements

in Charlotte, objected to the
proposed transfer to West Char-
lotte; however, the board as-
sured both sides that they would
be consulted before any future
action was taken.

““We are very pleased with
the outcome of the meeting,”

said one member of the “North
End" delegation. “I think you
could say that we got what we
went after, that being a mutual
agreement to proceed with cau-
tion in this school situation.”
