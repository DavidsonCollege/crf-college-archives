The Davidson College Ath- _

letic Department recently pur-

chased a new motorboat for

use at the lake campus. ,
The boat, an 18-foot Com-

petition Ski Nautique mar-
keted by the Southeast Cor-

rect Craft, Inc-of Orlando,

Fla., is intended primarily for
use by P.E. classes, but will
probably also receive use from
the Water Ski Club, and the
July Experience program for
high school students.

Since the creation of the
lake campus in 1963, David-
son has offered sailing, canoe-
ing and waterskiing programs

for students. The waterskiing
program has centered around
three boats. One has been a
runabout originally purchased
in 1963. The other two were
sold to the college by former

The Davidson men’s track
squad lost their first meets of
the 1977 season, losing to
Lynchburg 105-57 on March
19 and to Washington and Lee
81-64 on March 12. ~

However, despite the losses,
there were some bright spots
for the team.

Carl McPhail turned in
outstanding performances in
both meets. Against Lynch-
burg, McPhail won the 110m
high hurdles (15.6), the triple
jump (43’ 3/4’’), and the
440m intermediate hurdles
(57.4). Against Washington

and Lee, he again won the
triple jump (42’ 1%"’), the
440m intermediate hurdles
(57:01), and the 120 yd. high
hurdles (15:83).

Doug Horn was another
outstanding performer in the
two meets for the Wildcats.
He won the 1500m run against
Washington and Lee with a
school record of 4:18.51 and
placed second in the grueling
5000m run (16:23). In the
Lynchburg meet, Horn won
the 1500 m run with another
record time of 4:06.5 and
captured the steeplechase’
(9:45.6).

Jarry Taylor easily won the

basketball coach Terry Hol-
land and former lake campus
director Bruce Parker.

Over the years, all three of
these boats have needed re-
pairs from time to time and a

(Irv Wilson)

new boat was needed if the
Athletic Department was to
continue to offer waterskiing
as a P.E. course.

The Athletic Department
became acquainted with the

improve season

Lynchburg with a toss of 122’
3’’ and his younger brother,
David Taylor, placed third in
the discus against Washing-
ton and Lee with a throw of
128’ 4". Coach Sterling Martin
feels the younger Taylor may
be Davidson’s best bet in the
discus this year.

In the Washington and Lee
meet, many old school records
were broken: Pat Jenevein
(4:35) and Sal Caporale
(4:37.2) in the 1500m run; Jim
Douglas (52:36) and John
Stroud (53:08) in the 400m
run; Greg Kunkleman (2:09.5)
and Jenevein (2:12.5) in the
880m run; and Caporale (23:9)
and Phillip Gilbert (23:2) in
the 200m run.

Perhaps the brightest spot
in the week for Davidson was
the women’s track team who
scored a 55-36 victory over
Lynchburg.

Nancy Brown turned in a
good day’s effort with first
place finishes in the 1500m run
5:41.5) and the 800m run

(2:44.5).
Other standouts for the
women included: Kathy

Wilson who captured first

place in the long jump (13’ 10
1/2”’); Susan Curtis who won
the 100m hurdles (18.55); and
Nora McNeill who won the 100
yd. dash (12.3).

Coach Sterling Martin
commented on the women’s
effors: ‘‘They did an outstand-
ing job considering the fact
that their program is in its
infancy and they do not have a
budget to work from.”’

Davidson's next meet will

‘be against Appalachian State

on March 29.

Correct Craft Company asa
result of the efforts of Kevin
Taylor of the Water Ski Club.
The company caters to col-
leges, offering them substan-
tial discounts on the purchase.
In addition, the college will
return the craft each fall to the
company along with $500 and
receive a new boat.

Lake Campus Director Ster-
ling Martin is optimistic that
this feature of the arrange-
ment will save money that

otherwise would be spent on
boat maintenance.

The Ski Nautique is consid-
ered to be one of the top
brands of competition boats
which will be a plus for
Davidson if a competitive

motorboating team is ever
formed. The boat will not be
available for general use by
students. ;

The purchase of the boat is
part of a larger effort by the
Athletic Department to pro-
vide better waterfront facili-
ties for college use and so that
the lake campus will become
more of a selling point for the
college.

As part of this ‘‘rehabili-
tation project’’, the depart-
ment is working closely with
Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver Meetze on the possible
construction of new docking
facilities.

The purchase of the Ski
Nautique was financed by the
sale of the three boats that
were previously at the lake
campus and from the Athletic
Department budget.

An additional source of
revenue will be a hydroplane
regatta which will be held at
the lake campus the last
weekend in July. The Opti-

mists Club of Charlotte has
leased the lake campus for the
regatta and guaranteed at
least $500 to the Athletic
Department which would cov-
er next year’s payment to the
Correct Craft Company.
Athletic Director ‘Thom
Cartmill is pleased with the
purchase and feels that the Ski
Nautique will turn out to be “‘a
very worthwhile program for
all areas of the college.”
