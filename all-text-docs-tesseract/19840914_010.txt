10 Friday, September 14, 1984/The Davidsonian

Welcome, Freshmen. On this page we hope
to give you something to remember Orien-
tation by, for better of worse, and perhaps
get you started on that Davidson safety-
valve â€” Charlotte.

Davidsonian Photo Editor Peggy Pierotti designed
the page, senior Wilson Lowrey drew the map, and
the photo staffs of The Davidsonian and Quips and

Peggy Pierotti
Cranks shot the pictures.
