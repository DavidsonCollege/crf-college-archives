THE DAVIDSONIAN

ATO’s Win Track Meet
Nip Sigma Chis By 4 Points

On Wednesday afternoon the
ATO’s captured the interfrater-
ternity track meet and walked
off with the trophy by massing
24 points, four more than the
Sigma Chis could manage.

The Sigma Chis pulled in a
second place with 20 points and
the Kappa Sigs finished with 18
points, capturing the third spot.

The Phi Delts, defending
champs, had to settle for a sixth
place. It was the first time in
five years that the Delts failed
to claim the trophy.

The outstanding performance
for the afternoon was put on by
Steve Gill, who broke the exist-
ing I-F %4’s mile record dating
from 1949. The old time was
3:31 and Gill posted a 3:29.6.

JUST WAIT

With all the screamin’ and hollerin’ and yellin’ over
with and the tournament hubhub died down for another
season, there’s only one thing left to say—WAIT TILL
NEXT YEAR!

No word is out as yet, but we expect to hear any
day now that “Lefty” Driesell has been named coach of
the year in the Southern Conference. If he fails to show,
you can be sure there is something rotten in Virginia
namely sportswriters and sportscasters.

There’s just no rest for a basketball coach if he wants
to stay ahead of the pack. As soon as Driesell brought the
squad back from the tournament and before the basket-
balls were cold, he was off again to New Jersey to seek
out new prospects for next year's ‘better than ever” frosh
basketball team. He took with him a little more “bait”
in the way of scholarships than he had available for last
year’s recruiting.

We hope he can use the scholarship Bill Jarman is
vacating to pull in somebody big enough to fill Jarman’s
shoes.

THE PROS ENJOYED STAY

Tony Trabert and his touring pros descended on cam-
pus and proved to be as pleasant a diversion as has been
seen around the athletic department in many a day.

Apparently they enjoyed their stay as much as the
students who were able to talk to them and get to know
them. The Spanish and Australian pros atly enjoyed
eating down at the fraternity houses since they were
completely unfamiliar with the fraternity system.

All of them seemed to adjust easily into campus life,
some of them making a couple of trips up the road. This
caused Coach Harry Fogleman a little concern, fearing
that his tennis squad might follow their example. Per-
sonally, we don’t think Fogleman ought to worry too
much—after all, it doesn’t seem to have hurt McKay and
Bucholtz and the rest.

Easily the most impressive of the group was Trabert.
His quick wit and outgoing ity make him seem to
be the perfect type pemeen: promote such a tour.

In enough, Trabert has other claims to
fame ens i emi sl He was a «prety

r ard for a .
aaa Sackett roo a few years back. And playing
for Cincinnati is no easy task. _.

The matches they put on*were excellent and it look-
ed like they were enjoyed by the spectators as much as
anything at Davidson this year (except a couple of the
basketball games). It was interesting to note how le
can take on an entirely different nature when a few
thousand dollars is ri on their playing—and they
were all so good natured Monday afternoon when they
were just fooling around.

All the players said they enjoyed their stay and that
they would like to come back next year. Prospects for
this looks good, too. The half of the student body and
faculty who failed to show at the matches really missed
a top-notch performance. If they are able to make it
back next spring, don’t miss it again.

VPI AND W. VA. IN ACC?

Concerning the recently circulating rumor that VPI
and West Virginia will be leaving the Southern Confer-
ence to throw in with the ACC, we can only say that after
checking several sources, we can find no substantial basis

for the rumor. ;

All we can gather is that VPI, who would jump at
the chance of being in the ACC, couldn't get an invite into
the bigger conference, since they can’t even win in the
Southern Conference. West Virginia, on the other hand,
has never showed much interest in joining the ACC.

indoor meet of the season to-
morrow when they participate in

the meet.

“We've been progressing all

we're hoping for our best per-
formances in this meet. All the
boys have shown fine promise
and I expect lots from them this
year.”

What the team lacks right
now—and always has—is depth.
That they have the individual
stars is shown by the perform
ances turned in at the Southern
Conference meet two weeks ago.

dash, fourth in the 70-yard low

competition from Furman’s Bri-
tish import, Dave Segal, in to-
morrow night's 60-yard dash.
Segal finished first in the South-
ern Conference 60-yards.

And the “Mighty Mite” from
Charleston, W. Va., Sterling

Almost Stole Tournament

BY CHARLIE SHAPARD
Sports Staff. Writer

The Davidson Wildcats returned from Richmond and the Southern Conference |

Tournament with the runner-up trophy and a 20-7 season record, the best in

school’s history.

Although they didn’t take the
SC crown, the ’Cats led by
Senior Captain Bill Jarman and
sophomore sensation Fred Het-
zel, showed SC fans that David-
son is a for-real threat to West

Virginia domination in confer- .

ence action.

After whipping VMI and
VPI, the ‘Cats were given lit-
tle hope of making the game
close with the Mountaineers
who had beaten them 89-63 in
their first meeting at Morgan-
ton, W. Va.

Davidson fans were scarce at
the start of the championship
tilt and those there were over-
shadowed by the WVU mass,
which had followed the Moun-
ties from the hills.

The Mountaineers got off to
a fast start and led 20-9 with
13:19 left inthe half. The lead
went to 13 twice, but the de-
termined ‘Cats fought back

With 3:28 left in the half,
WVU held a 10 point edge
over the ‘Cats. However from
that point on, the underdogs

ran off a 12-2 surge that start-
ed with Holland‘s 2-pointer
and caught the West Virgin-
ians at intermission, 46-46,
with Junior Bill Beerman’s
jump shot with :02 left on the
clock.

The second half found the
score see-sawing back and forth
between the rejuvenated Wild-
cats and the Mountaineers. With
WVU leading 57-54, Holland
stole the ball and scored.

WVU _ backcourt ace Rod
Thorn, attempting to block Hol-
land’s shot off the back board,
injured his ankle and was out
of action for three and one-half
minutes.

Grapplers Competing
In Conference Tourney

BY JOHNNY CLARK
Sports Staff Writer

Davidson’s wrestling team, the best in school history,
began action today in the first round of the Southern
Conference wrestling tournament at Morganton, West

Virginia. The tournament will conclude wi

finals matches.

West Virginia, the host team,
ranks as a co-favorite along with
defending champion Virginia
Tech and the always tough Ci-
tadel grapplers.

Dave Cain in the 123 Ib. divis-
ion, and Jim Jioio in the 157
lb. class, both undefeated this
year, are the outstanding Moun-
taineer representatives in the
matches. Harry Sisler, 167 |b.
winner last year, is fighting this
year for West Virginia in the
heavyweight bracket.

Virginia Tech’s Ernie Ven-
tuvino (123 lbs.), Dave Ellerman
(137 lbs.), and Bob Hatcher (157
Ibs.) are defending their indi-
vidual championships won last
year. VMI has 177 Ib. champ,
Bob Hill, attempting to defend
his crown,

“The tournament is about as
evenly matched as it has been
in years,” comments Wildcat
Coach Charlie Parker. “No one
team is a clear-cut choice to
win.”

Davidson is represented in all

tomorrow’s

weight divisions this year.

“From our team Mike Bisard
(123 Ibs.), a sophomore, and
Billy Mills (167 Ibs.), who placed
third last year, probably have
the best chance of winning,”
relates Parker. “Tommy Wright
(130 Ibs.), Joe Jones (157 Ibs.),
Tom Day (177 Ibs.), and Russ
Walls (heavyweight) all have a
good chance of placing,” he
adds.

Lanier Burns, a 137 pounder,
and Hugh Allen in the 147 Ib.
group round out the entries for
the Wildcats.

“LEFTY” DIESELL
..» Almost

Thorn returned to steady the
Mountaineer attack.

Capitalizing on the loss of
three Davidson starters via
fouls, Holland with 10:14 left,
Davidson at 3:36, and Teague
with :35 left, WVU went on to
eapture their eighth Southern
Conference title 79-74 and the
right to carry the SC banner in-
to the NCAA tournament. They
will meet the University of Con-
necticut, March 11, in Philadel-
phia’s Palestra.

in the championship game
Jarman led both teams in scor-
ing with 23 points; Hetzel
scored 21 to give him 76
points for the three day event
and the tournament scoring
leadership over Thorn who
had 75 points.

Sophomore Barry Teague
proved to be the event's top
foul shooter, hitting 19 for 20,
his only miss coming in the
VPI game.

No definite decision has
been made on the location of
the tournament for next year,
although there was much talk
about a possible change.

The Richmond people have
done a fine job in promoting the
event and putting the tourney
on. However, it was generally
felt that the tournament has out-
grown the Richmond Arena, al-
though Richmond is the ideal
geographic location

Holding 5,200, the Arena lacks
the capacity necessary to hold
an event of this type. Four rows

of seats were added to the pres-!

ent capacity on the same level
with the court. Vision-blocking
posts are found at each end of
the court, which is surrounded
by a cement floor.

Television and press facili-
ties also were inadequate. TV
cameras had little space and
had their vision blocked by
fans when they stood up. The
press box, although more ade-
quate ‘still had much to be
desired,

Outside, parking facilities
were available, but were more
like rice paddies after the rainy
weather that fell over the Rich-
mond area during the three-day
event,

The general concensus is
that the tournament will be
moved from the Arena, either
to Blacksburg, with a seating
capacity of 10,000, or to Char-
lotte in the 12,000 seat Coli-
seum.

Because of the VPI homecourt
advantage, it appears that the
Southern Conference Tourna-
ment will be in Charlotte in
1964. However the tournament
site will not be determined un-
til May 3 when there will be a
Conference meeting at Morgan-

Tony Trabert’s Pros

PAGE THREE

Put On Fine Show

Last Monday night, approximately 1300 spectators
had the distinct pleasure of watching six of the world’s

best tennis players perform

The World Series of Profes-
sional Tennis arrived on the
Davidson College campus on
Sunday, March 3. That after-
noon, several students had an
opportunity to meet. certain
members of the touring tourna-
ment when the players ate
lunch at some of the fraternity
houses.

In chapel the following
morning, the student body
was treated to a short and
humorous address by Series
Director Tony Trabert, prev-
iously a player on the tour.

Trabert, who had formerly
played at the University of Cin-
cinnati under the tutelage of
Davidson's present tennis coach.
Harry Fogleman, remarked,
“Coach Fogleman taught me
how to play tennis, and I taught
him how to eat. You can judge
for yourselves who did the bet
After his address, Tra
bert introduced the members of
the

ter job.’

ur

Although the crowd Monday
night was rather small, the
fans proved to be enthusias-
tic and appreciative. Every-
one appeared to have gotten
his money’s worth of enter-

| tainment.

In the first match rookie Rod

in Johnston Gymnasium.

Laver from Australia demon-
strated the speed, power, and
unusual ability that make him
the likely candidate to become
the next pro champion in de
feating Chilean Luis Ayala, 83.

In the second match another
Aussie, Ken Rosewall, the tour
nament leader, downed Ear)
Buchholz from St. Louis, 85.

The third match was a
doubles contest. The players
hammed it up and Buchholz
and Laver finally won over
Rosewall and Ayala in a crowd
pleaser, 8-5.

The final match between
Dayton, Ohio, native Barry Mac
Kay and Andres Gimeno from
Barcelona, Spain, was the clos
est of the evening. Each player
won his serve until the twelfth

ame when Gimeno broke Mac
Kay's serve and went ahead 7-5
MacKay seemed to give up, and
Gimeno took four straight point
to win the match, 8-5

This ended a night
fantastic and
neanny volleys. Tuesday morn-

g the World Series of Profes
sional Tennis packed up and
left Davidson, but those of us
who were fortunate enough to
see it will not soon forget their
