THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, MARCH 2, 1962

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Our Candidate

Wednesday, in the very first day
of voting, the student body disposed
with what usually takes at least two
or three run-offs. At the close of the
balloting, three men had been given
a clear bid to state their platforms
next Monday.

It is indeed unusual that the
student body narrowed its field to
three so early in the voting. The three
candidates should consider this ser-
ious!y. We hope that they will evi-
dence merit of this distinction Monday
by giving a straight-forward state-
ment of their conception of student
government and their stands on vital
campus issues.

We are constantly concerned by
those students ‘who ask “what can the
student council do?” We want to know
what Messrs. Carrell, Kelley and Kil-
lian feel a student government at
Davidson can and should do.

Three ‘years ago student govern-
ment at Davidson hit rodk& bottom.
The last two years have seen more
determined efforts for an active coun-
cil. We would like to see it go even
further. There is no reason why THE
DAVIDSONIAN should be the sole

active voice of the campus.

We realize it is not “politically”
expedient to take definite stands on
campus issues. That method of cam-
paigning works no ways as success-
fully as the regular 10:30 stud break
and the “good guy” popularity ap-
peal.

But next Monday, the student
body will be looking for some dis-
tinctive differences in three individ-
uals who all pass the “good guy”,
Davidson gentleman test. We hope
they will be able to find them. And
we suggest they begin by looking for
the candidate with a real program in
mind for the student council, with a
vision of what Davidson student gov-
ernment can be with some hard work.
He will get our vote if he is forthcom-
ing.

Wednesday’s kickoff of elections
Saw a little over 500 students voting,
a poor record considering each -fra-
ternitv had its vested interests to
support. We hope this is no indication
of the peak participation. It is hardly
a mandate of support when a winning
candidate is backed by so small a
percentage of the student body.

The Grand Old Tour

As the standard of living of the
average Davidson Gentleman has in-
creased, the Old Southern Custom of
taking a Grand Tour of the Old World
for Cultural Purposes has become
more and more wide-spread. Partic-
ularly in the past few years, many
students have spent summers or even
lounger periods of time in Europe.

The tours which are organized by
Pres. and Mrs. Martin have done a
great deal to encourage this trend.
They have, however, been restricted
in size and restrictive in price. With
the airlines now offering substantial
reductions in the cost of a round-trip
flight to Europe for groups of over
24 persons and even greater bargains
available for a group which is large
enough to charter a plane, we would

What's Ahead For

Twice this past week interested
groups of students and faculty gath-
ered unofficially to discuss the plight
of the campus magazine and its re-
cent attempts at humor. In addition,
The Student Council Wednesday night
devoted its meeting to the problem of
Seripts ‘n Pranks.

It was time for some serious dis-
cussion and evaluation to come forth.
Last fall THE DAVIDSONIAN ex-
pressed its feelings. For the past few
years we have been consistently in
favor of a literary magazine in the
broadest sense of the word. Frankly,
we had expected student discontent to
express itself more vocally after the
appearance of the Midwinters issue.

The history of the magazine at
Davidson is a long involved series of
varied names and varied efforts—The
Davidson College Magazine, the
Chameleon, the Yowl, and most re-
cently Scripts ‘n Pranks. Each indi-
cates an attempt to change the charac-
ter of the magazine.

The Yowl had come in the 1930's
to concentrate on humor. It was a
feeble concentration. Most writers will
admit that good humor is the most
difficult thing to produce in the liter-
ary field. Trustee action created
Scripts ‘n Pranks with the stated pur-
pose that it be a literary magazine.
However, good humor was not to be
excluded.

In the last two decades, however,
we have seen a gradual slipping back
to that which was abolished. The
magazine has become more and more
devoted to humor with the accom-
panying result of more and more
poor humor.

like to suggest that a campus group
organize an European tour for this
following summer.

By reducing the cost of trans-
Atlantic transportation to around
$300 and by taking advantage of fur-
ther group reductions for travel in
Euronc itself as well as living in the
International Youth Hostels, the cost
of the trip could be reduced to rock-
bottom. In addition to an organized
tour, students from Davidson and
other schools who wanted to travel
independently in Europe could take
advantage of the reduced flight costs
by travelling with the group.

The idea is certainly worth in-
vestigation. Our nomination for or-
ganizer—the YMCA.

L.K.

The Magazine?

The Midwinters issue speaks for
itself. It makes no professions of be-
ing literary and any pretenses at hu-
mor are dubious.

_ The main problem of the maga-
zine goes back primarily we feel, to
students. Before a real literary maga-
zine is possible at Davidson there
must be wider student participation
and interest and encouragement.
That is the thought foremost in the
minds of those people actively wrést-
ling with the problem now.

_ In the light of the current dis-
Satisfaction and discussion, we feel
that it is wise to postpone election of
next year’s editor of the magazine. In
all fairness to the candidates and the
students there needs to be a clearer
understanding of the magazine’s fu-

ure.

Student Body President George
Trask is most anxious to see a healthy
literary magazine on campus. We
pledge him our full support and co-
operation in the study of the problem
and working out of a new program.
But we feel most strongly that as the
problem arises from the students, the
solution must likewise be forthcom-
ing from them.

This is impossible unless you ex-
press vour feelings, your suggestions
and your interests about the magazine
which represents you. We want a
magazine we can be proud to claim as
ours.

We welcome your letters to the
paper, or if you prefer more direct
expressions, we encourage you to con-
vey your opinions and ideas to Trask
or the magazine staff or this editor.

University Center Program
Will Supplement Present One

BY GREG GOVAN

Davidsonian Staff Writer

At their last meeting, the
Board of Trustees took permis-
sive action On the proposal for
Davidson to join the Piedmont
University Center.'This was, in
effect, a go-ahead for participa-
tion in the regional consolida-
tion and cooperation program.

Headquarters of the Center is
located in Greensboro, Presi-
dent D. G. Martin said. in an in-
terview. Dr. Harold Hutson of
Greensboro College and Dr.
Dale Gramley of Salem College
have been the leaders of .the
proposed organization.

50 MILE RADIUS

President Martin stated. that
the Center would be comprised
of schools in the Piedmont
area, a very rough designation.
but generally within about a 50
mile radius. Specific refererices
were made to Greensboro,
Salem, Wake Forest, Burlington,
Ashford, Catawba, arid both
Livingston and North Carolina
Agricultural and Technical,
Piedmont Negro institutions.

What exactly does the Center
hope to accomplish? Martin said
that it was an effort to pool
resources for speakers, library
and taboretory facilities, and
cultural activities that the in..
dividual schools might be un.
willing or unable to support

alone.

Another question which was
raised by the trustees’ action is
whether Davidson could not
profit more by associating with
such schools as Duke, Carolina,
State, and Washington and Lee.
Martin said that the reason was
mainly one of proximity. Since
the program is based on sharing
people and things, convenience
of delivery is essential.

To an unasked question, Mar-
tin answered, “I don't believe
that our prestige would be les-
sened.” In addition, it will be
privilege of Davidson to help
out institutions which are less
fortunate in endowments. There
is no competition for applicauts
between Davidson and the other
schools,. Martin added.

COMPETITION MEASURE

This venture in cooperation
is not to be construed as an un-
precedented jump. President
Mertin cited similar programs
in Virginia and Atlanta, Geor-
gia. New Republic, June 19,
1961, mentioned two other co-
operation programs, the Clare-
mont Colleges in southern Cali-
fornia and the Connecticut. Val-
ley of Massachusetts project.

The same article also analyzes
the situation which is leading
to the consolidation movement.
With the wholesale increase of
public colleges and universities,

the private institutions cannot
compete for students without a
“famous brand name.” This
selling point is the possession
of only about one in ten, how-
ever,

The outlook for the smaller
schools, particularly sectarian,
the article states as “very grim
unless consolidation, federation,
or some other curb on institu-
tional nationalism does not
broaden the vistas they offer
their students.”

NEGATIVE SIDE

While some would view with
complacency the demise of the
small college, the majority see
it as disastrous. But what about
the “brand name” schools? New
Republic states that “good col-
leges fear that collaboration
would jeopardize the special
quality of their campus life,
produce a sprawling bureau-
cracy, and undercut local vested
interests which cverybody is
happy to see gratified. Colleges
usually consolidate their efforts
only when on the verge of
bankruptcy.”

Where does Davidson fit in-
to this picture? Is it the liberal
arts Good Samaritan, or is the
judgment of New Republic
dated and invalid? The question
will be answered next Septem-
ber when the program begins
to build.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Race

hlitism Unfounded

For Nazis And America

Frakes

Dear Editor:

One of the most significant
figures of this century has said,
No more than Nature de-
sires the mating of weaker
with stronger individuals,
even less does she desire
the: blending of a higher
with a lower race . . . His-
torical experience shows
with terrifying clarity that
in every mingling of Aryan
blood with that of lower
peoples the result was the
end of the cultured people. |
North America, whose
population consists. in by
far the largest part of Ger-
manic elements who mixed
but little with the lower
colored peoples, shows a
different humanity and cul-
ture from Central and
South America, where the
predominantly Latin im-
migrants often mixed with
the aborigines on a large
seale .. . The Germanic in-
habitant of the American
continent . . . will remain
the master as long as he
does not fall victim to the

defilement of the blood.

who repeats his ideas is a
Fascist—for that would be as
absurd as arguing that a man
is a Communist because he
opposes laissez-faire capital-
ism or nuclear tests—but to
express amazement at the
white racial elitism proclaim-
ed from time to time at Dav-
idson and to raise some ques-
tions about this elitism.

The elitist argument often
runs as follows: Colored peo-
ples are constitutionally and
genetically (not just culturally)
inferior to Aryan peoples. Ming-
ling of white and colored en-
hances the chances of inter-
racial marriages, which if it
occurred widely would destroy
American civilization, reducing
America to the backwardness of
Spain or Latin America. There-
fore, every possible barrier be-
tween white and black in this
country must be preserved.

The questions I would raise
are as follows: Does the convic-
tion that non-Aryans are con-
stitutionally inferior originate
in empirical observation or in
un-examined visceral reactions?
(When IQ tests were adminis-
tered to large numbers of peo-
ple for the first time in World
War I, the average for the IQ's
of Northern Negroes was higher
than the average for the 1Q’s of

WHY NOT LEAVE ITON THE ”

KIND OF NICE LYING THERE... TH
RED COLOR MAKES A NICE
WITH ALL THIS GREEN

mA

Southern whites, which might
suggest that intelligence, as
measured by IQ tests, is as much
a function of culture as it is of
heredity.)

Does the mingling of two
groups necessarily mean wide-
spread inter-marriege? (There
ts relatively little segregation
of Jew from Gentile in this
country and very little inter-
marriage.) In this status-seek-
ing society are many people,
‘white or colored,‘ likely to
marry far below their educa-
tional and cultural levels?
(The only inter-racial coupte
1 know well are equals; he
(white) is a Harvard man and
she (Negro) is a Vassar grad-
vate.)

Does the argument that the
“backwardness” of Spain and
Portugal stems from widespread
inter-marriage of Aryan and
Negro rest upon a circumspect
historical judgment—or upon
the selection of facts in order
to rationalize dogma? Does not
any form of racial elitism—
which twenty years ago was
used to justify some of the most
barbaric acts the world has yet
seen—always lead to cruelty
and injustice?

Vagabonds Have

Overall

BY HARRY WEST
Davidsontan Staff Writer

The Christians were victor-
fous over the lions Tuesday
night and so thwarted the de
sire of the Roman populace to
see a crowd of cranks eaten.
In fact, one of the lions, a
crank himself, joined the Chris-
tians.

A small, but apprecietive aud-
lance watched the Vagsbonds
stage Bernard Shaw's comic se-
tire, Androcles and the Lion.
And it was obvious as they ieft
that the play was to have a suc:
cessful three-night run.

Shaw, who dedicated his
comedies to bursting the bal-
loons of hollow pretentions and
accepted conventions, wished
here to show us what the Rom-
an persecutions and all such
persecutions are: attempts to
suppress movements which
threaten established law and
order. And more particularly,
he wanted to puncture the bal-
loons of conventionalized relig-
ion and philosophy, being blown
bigger by “opportunist Have.
and-Holders.”” His vehicle here
is bufoonery. A group of Chris-
tians, who are, therefore,
cranks, are doomed to die by an
autocratic fool, Caesar, who is
equally amused with killing as
with sparing. Ferrovius, a
Pauline Christian of great
strength, whose business it is
to wrestle for men’s souls, tears
a lion to pieces.

Androcles, our casual hero
and. Mr. Milquetoast in one, hav-
ing extracted a thorn from a
lion’s paw in a forest near
Rome, is finally thrown into
the arena to be eaten. The lion
approaches and recognizes An-
drocies as his saviour and the
two dance off together. And
Caesar’s whole spectacle for that

Success

day is ruined and he will have
to wait for another batch of
lions and Christians.

Costuming, lighting effects,
and sets were excellent. And
for the most part, the acting
was good. Walter Bost and
Louise Hampton, as Androcles
and his wife, turned in excel-
lent performances. Chip Clark,
as Caesar, and Walker Clarke,
as Lentulus, were hilarious. Jan
Papra and Rufus Hallmark were
convincing as Ferrovius and the
Editor. And from Tommy Hamil.
ton’s energetic portrayal - of
Spintho we found out that Rom.
ans wore bermuda shorts under
their tunics.

The weakest, but not neces-
sarily poor, portrayals were
Lavinia, Ellen Winkler, and the
Captain, Walt McNairy. Lavinia
was meant to be a light-hearted
free-thinker and _ represented
Shaw's serious ideas. The Cap.

tain was representative of
Shaw's opponent. And in the
play, they are given long

speeches (and it is therefore
partly Shaw’s fault. they: don’t
go off well). In the middle of
this buffoonery we have tong
serious arguments by ‘Lavinia
and the Captain; and it just
doesn’t fit. Lavinia is supposed
to mock the Captain, not engage
him in serious argument.

Androcles and the Lion was
great fun. We left happy that
we had seen it. And we laughed
about the performances of
Clark and Clarke, Papra and
Bost. In fact, they were so de-
lightful we didn't care what
they said so much as how they
said it. We were sure that both
Christians and Romans had been
satirized; but we were not quite
sure about what they had been
satirized. Shaw is dashingly
witty and we tend to watch his
swords, not his balloons.

Tortured Student Reveals
New Subversive Element

BY JOHN MOREFIELD
Davidsonian Staff Writer

It wasn’t enough that they
turned the Union lounge into a
tropical paradise. No. Now
they've turned the Coke ma-
chines against us. If you have
to ask who “They” is, or are,
you lack a basic awareness of
life. Suffice it to say that
“They” are much too real. Who
is “Us?” “Us” refers to those
of us whom “They” sit around
thinking up ways to torment,
that’s who.

About the coke machines. I
used to like the coke machines,
and I think, humbly, that they
liked me. On nights when I was
up late, like the last night be-
fore classes ended last semes-
ter, when I still had five philo-
sophy papers to do, to be hand.
ed in before noon the next day
... on nights like that, I had
the coke machines to be my
friends. I would leave my type-
writer in the lobby (it disturbs
my roommate), crushing Joad's
Guide to Philosophy in my rag-
ing little hands, and, after sob-
bing quietly into the darkness
outside the front door, I would
remember the coke machines,
one in particular, the one in

. Belk.

WRITER EULOGIZES

She... oops! I mean it, would
always be there, just inside the
back door, humming sensually
in her electrically flashing soli-
tude, just waiting for a kind
caress, always ready with a
comforting click or gurgle (as
the cup was filled with the
soothing juices of early-morning
sustenance). How can I explain
or reproduce what those nights
meant to me? And the sweet
little coke machine? She was too
good. Too good, indeed, to bo
corrupted with the absoluteness
with which her brothers and
sisters were corrupted. For she
gives my money back.

I get no coke, to be sure, no
warmth or comfort any more,
but she, at least, doesn’t take
my money. She must have
stronger character than the
others.

Not so the machine in Watts,

GET OUT OF HERE!

the Monster of Grubby Hall.
It takes the quarter, all right,
and makes change. The cup
tumbles down. But all I get is a
cup of compressed air. A ten-
cent cup of compressed air.

But these are not the worst
of the coke machines on cam-
pus. There’s the one in which
the cup tumbles over to the
side and the coke runs down in-
to and through the little drain
there. There's one that doesn’t
even bother to drop a cup. And
who can forget the little gem
in the union, which squirts the
coke cunningly to the side, a-
round the cup?

SUFFERING UNIQUE

I realize, of course, that I am
not the only one who suffers at
the hands of these diabolical de-
vices. But I think I have suf-
fered more. Have you ever been
dumped on by a’ passionate girl
coke machine?

Something, of course, must be
done. But I cannot say who is
bringing about this slow, cruel
attack on our morales, except
that it is “They.” “They” are
responsible for everything that
happens to “Us.” I must admit
that we cannot rule out the
Possibility of Communist sub-
version. It really makes a great
deal of sense, when you. th
about it. What better way of
robbing Americans of their dol-
lars than a slow, creeping, rath-
ed inconspicuous thing like an
army of dishonest coke ma-
chines?

We could station a
Spy to watch each coke machine
day and night from a telephone
booth, or from the darkness
underneath the staircase, just
to see who comes to empty the
ooin box on each machine.
These persons should be appre-
hended and checked, and if
their social security numbers
don't check out, or if there has
ever been any red hair in their
family, or if they have some
strange, wwild-eyed love for
Tchaikovsky, they should be
locked away in a safe place.

Who knows what might be
eventually brought about by
such a small beginning? I vag-
uely imagine coke being de-
clared subversive by the HUAC,
and Pepsi and Nehi becoming
Suspect in the eyes of all good
God-and-country-fearing Ameri-
cans. And though I hate to see
coke go, I am willing to sacrifice
for the sake of a better and
cleaner America.

I hope only for one thing. I
hope they will go easy on the
little machine in Belk. I am still
quite fond of her, even though
they have taken her face away.
