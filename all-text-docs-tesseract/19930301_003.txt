Sigma Phi

By Mandy Curtis

Since the “road-tripping” in-
cident that inflicted injury on fresh-
man Alfredo Urbino on February
1, the Sig Ep fraternity house has
been put on an educational pro-
gram as punishment for this pledg-
ing violation.

A Review Committee headed
by Patterson Court Advisor Kurt
Holmes, including Patterson Court
Council President Julie Petty, KA
President Rod Carter, Assistant
Dean of Students John Eaves, and
faculty representative, Alex
Pinkston formed to review the situ-
ation.

They then made recommen-
dations to Dean Terry and Presi-
dent Kuykendall as to the actions

the College should take in dealing
with individuals involved and the
fraternity itself.

According to Holmes, the
sanctions
made ___ be-
tween the
College and
the Sig Ep
house are
“program-
matic andnot —
punitive.”
The program, which includes vari-
ous “projects,” is designed to help
the fraternity and the whole court.

Holmes did not release spe-
cifics about the sanctions received
by the individuals and the whole

bers of the house. However, he
feels that it is “time to talk.”

Scott Newnam, president of
Sig Ep, would not commenton the
details of the sanctions. He ex-
plained that the fraternity is “go-
ing beyond what the College is
asking of them.” There will be an
All-Campus Educational Program
sponsored by the Sig Ep fraternity
to help the court and the campus,
according to Newnam.

Because Sig Ep's National or-
ganization responded quickly and
worked with the chapter at

Davidson, the College was able to '

come to decisions quickly, accord-
ing to Holmes. Currently the fra-
ternity is still in good standing
with its national as well as with the

fraternity withrespect for the mem-

Flu Epidemic Sweeps the Campus

By Jennifer Kerns

You know it is cold and flu
season when you can hear cough-
ing and sneezing over the sound of
your professor. Davidson has re-
cently fallen victim to a malevo-
lent virus. The health facility is as
crowdedasthe Union Cafeattimes.

According to the infirmary
records, an average of 40-50 people
visited the infirmary each day this
week. These numbers are not ex-
traordinary, however. Joe Ann

Land, a nurse at the Student Health
Center, comments, “ever since we
came back from break, it has been
bad.”

Most of the students treated
had viral infections with flu-like
symptoms, although there have
been a few cases of .more serious
nature. Unfortunately, there is not
any prescription medication to
solve these problems (the flu shot
isnotavailable). The sufferer must
instead stock up on over-the-

social process of freshman year.
This is an obvious reduction to the
advantages usually given to those
who survived freshman year, and
we feel it is a poor solution to a
problem that has been invented by
the RLO itself.”

Other students feel good about
the change. Leigh Patterson be-
lieves it will have a positive im-
pact. “The concern now is that
students do not care about meeting
new people and are not willing to

reach out to others on their halls. I
think people would feel more com-
fortable about getting to know oth-
ers on the hall better if they were
not living with a cluster of friends.
Students will be more willing to
participate in hall interaction.”

What do you think? Resi-
dence Life encourages students to
read the printed explanation of the
policy and to come by RLO to
discuss their opinions. Terry said
the office hopes to do an exit sur-
vey at the close of next year to
evaluate the results.

counter drugs like the Tylenol,
Sucrets, and Robitussin to allevi-
ate pain and congestion. Some
traditional ways to avoid and ease
flu symptoms include sleeping
(more than eight hours per night),
gargling with salt water to relieve
asore throat, and perhaps buying a
humidifier to help clear conges-
tion.

Most of the students have been
attending class despite theirhealth.
“T cannot afford to miss classes,”
one sick individual declares. While
it is conscientious to go to class
sick, it is also hazardous to every-
one else’s health.

Rima Chakrabati, one of many
flu sufferers, laments that, “one of

the hardest things about recover-
ing is that you think you are getting
better, but when you try to resume
your normal schedule, you find
you are headed towards a relapse.
It hits you very hard at times.”

She insists that her employ-
ers have been very good about
excusing her from work and that
professors have also expressed
concem.

If a student feels ill, he or she
should visit the infirmary. It is as
close as you will get to the treat-
ment of home, fresh chicken soup,
and of course, Mom.

College, explained Holmes. Pledg-
ing has continued.

“As tragic as it was, I think
some good has come out of it,”
stated Holmes. He said that the
incident has helped in making it
easier for others to come forward if
there are any violations of pledg-
ing regulations on campus. “‘We
are constantly encouraging pledges
and fraternity brothers to tell of
any violations.”

However, Holmes also stated
that because the College took
strong actions in dealing with this
situation the message has been sent
that the College is serious. Since
the incident, there have been other
things that Holmes has followed
upon buthe has learned of no other

specific incidents.

Holmes feels that the impact
the Sig Ep incident has had on the
other fraternities has been two-
fold.

They have either “toned down
their programs or have gotten more
discreet; it’s probably a combina-
tion of the two.” He stated, “I'd
like to think that no one has done a
‘road-trip’ since.”

Currently the College has
“pretty good pledging restrictions;
however, next year there will be
more specific guidelines,” accord-
ing to Holmes. “Road-tripping”
and personal servitude will be
among the things tobe specifically
mentioned next year.

Election Results Posted

By Alice Felmlee

Last week the Council on
Campus and Religious Life,- the
Student Conduct Council, and
Reach Outheldtheirelections. All
of these positions run without cam-
paigning except for Reach Out.
The Reach Out candidates for
President and Vice President, Julia
Barnes and freshman, Nicole
Howard, ran unopposed thus. no
banners, flyers or pamphlets lined
the dorm halls, classrooms, or the
Chambers Lawn.

* Because run-offs were re-
quired for both the CCRL and the
SCC elections the winners were
not announced until Wednesday
evening. Joining the CCRL are
Alex Crumbley and Chris
Edmonston; Shaye Benton and
John Harper are now members of
the SCC.

The Reach Outpositions were
pretty much decided on the night
of the candidates meeting as both
were unopposed. “When I went to
the meeting they told me I was
unopposed and then congratulated
me on becoming the new Reach
Out President,” said Julia Barnes.

John Philpott, Chairman of the
Elections Committee, commented,
“In order for a candidate to win
they must have a majority plus
one. Whenever there are a lot of
people running for one or two of-“~
fices the need for run-offs in-
creases.” In addition, he called for
reform tothe tally process. “Count-
ing all of the ballots by hand and
tallying them all by hand takes a
ridiculous amount of time and
leaves itself open to error.” As an
alternative he suggested scan-tron
sheets oreven old voting machines.
