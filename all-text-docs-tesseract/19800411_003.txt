Album Review

The Clash attacks the bloody world

The Clash— London Calling

Change has always been im-
portant in rock music and
anyone expecting the same
chemistry on the new Clash
album, as existed on the first
two power platters will be
surprised. William Carlos Wil-
liams said it best:

“To stop the flames that
destroy the old nest prevents
the rebirth of the bird itself. All
things rot and stink, nothing
more than-an old nest, if not
recreated, this is the essence of
what art is expected to do and
cannot live without doing.”

The Clash have found a new
formula on ‘‘London Calling.”
What is it?

“Hey Joe, you goin’ down to
the market place to find your
soul?”’

“T and I, man.”

“You poured your beer in me
hat, man!”

What is this ska stuff any-
way? In the sixties, the Skin-
head gangs in England picked
up on some of the more plastic
Jamaican reggae, remember
“the Israelites?”” As Bob Mar-
ley has grown in popularity, his
music has deteriorated into a
non-gutsy pop-reggae. What
Marley seems to be losing, the
Clash have most certainly dis-
covered: Joe Strummer is possi-
bly the gutsiest, most raucous
singer in music today and by
God, does he mean it...

The first cut on the album is
the title track in which Strum-
mer makes a plea to the youth
of the world to stop living in the
past (‘‘All that phoney Beatle-
mania has bitten the dust”).
The song warns of the final
Apocalypse that must be recog-
nized if anything is to be done.
The irony of the situation is
cleverly put across in the final
line of the chorus:

‘...A nuclear error, but I
have no fear

London is drowning—And I
live by the river.”

Although the Strummer
stance is heroic, Joe himself has
no time for heroes as the song
‘Death of Glory’’ seems to
prove. Possibly the most power-

ful song on the album, Strum-
mer and Jones attack those rock
‘n roll heroes who sing for the
people with all their hearts and
then laugh all the way to the
bank. No way. Rock ’n roll is a
serious business with a serious
point to make. The Clash are
certainly a very serious band
and should not be dismissed too
lightly. There’s trouble ahead!
‘“Rudie can’t Fail’’ is equally
successful and reveals the
band’s excellent sense of hu-
mor. ‘Jimmy Jazz,’’ which
sounds as:if it was recorded in a
gin-soaked bar, reveals Strum-
mer’s new-found clarity and
range. Sounding at times like
an English Tom Waits, he
brilliantly slurs and spits his
way through this jazzy number.

The drugs that take him
nowhere, pointing the finger at
the man who is always taking
the money. Another superbly
perceptive song is ‘‘Right Pro-
file,’ which describes the de-
mise of Monty Clift, a man who
was never left alone for one
moment, a man who took pills
to soothe the pain of public
attention. But the public gaze
never left him, even when he lay

dead in his car:

“Everybody say ‘What’s’ he
like?’

Everybody say ‘Is he al-
right?’

Everybody say ‘He sure look
funny.’

That's Monty Clift, Honey!""

ness of the modern youth, left
to shop unhappily in a world of
disco albums and special offers.
They’ll even pretend to sell you
‘Personality.’ But its all to
persuade you to work all day for
nothing: ‘‘Working for the
Clampdown.” Perhaps the most
bitter song on the album,
‘‘Clampdown’’ describes the
way people can be twisted by
propaganda into believing any-
thing they’re told. The song is
brutal,*the message is direct
and bullets into the head:

‘“‘And I’ve given away no
secrets.

Who’s barmy now?”’

“The Card Cheat’’ is possibly

my favorite track on this double,

album. Look lads, what’s the
point, of all this cheating. We'll
all end up in the same place
anyway. Death, death, death—
for the sake of King and
Country. Remember ‘‘Tommy
Gun.” ‘‘Whatever he wants,
he’s gonna get it.”’ ‘‘But,’’ says
Joe, ‘Don’t let those toughies
get you down—stand up to the
bastards!”

“I’ve been beat up. I’ve been
thrown out but I’m not down.
I’m not down.”

Four horsemen gonna come

ready! Let’s escape-from this
Babylon! Don’t be fooled now,

Bombs...’

The Clash have entered the
’80s with an album of great
strength and power. This album
seems so relevant in a world fast
collapsing with economic greed
and procratinating politicians. I
hope people will listen to Strum-
mer and Co. who seem dedi-
cated to something better, and
maybe, who knows? ‘‘Music
may still save the world.”

Students live

Davidson does not die in the

summer. The townspeople re-

main, and last year approxi-
mately forty students spent
their summer break in or near
the community. Some of these
students worked, some attend-
ed classes at UNCC, some were
involved with July Experience,
others worked on service pro-
jects and still others remained
to finish accumulated incom-
pletes.

Teri Butler lived in Davidson,
but spent most of her time at
UNCC taking chemistry
courses. She sublet an apart-
ment and said ‘‘housing is
relatively easy to get—it’s just
a question of how cheap.”

Butler enjoyed meeting the
townspeople. ‘‘One of the u-
nique things was that if you ran

_ into anyone in the post office,

you really talked rather than
just saying hello.’’ She was also
surprised at the number of

_graduates and students who

passed through Davidson dur-
ing the summer.

‘“‘All roads seemed to lead to
Davidson. If anyone passing
through knew you were here,
you could count on meeting at
the Peregrine House or at least

on having someone sleep.on:

Davidson.

as a counselor for the July
Experience. During the pro-
gram, he had little opportunity
to see his friends. Before and
after the program, however, he
was able to get to know
townspeople not affiliated with
the college. ‘“‘Most faculty are
gone or busy with their fami-
lies,’’ he explained.

Miller noticed that both the
gym and lake campus were in
constant use, and that on
Thursday nights, ‘‘the Pere-
grine House was jammed. E-
verybody was there.”

He found his Davidson sum-
mers especially fun because he
had time to relax and to just sit
around and ‘talk. ‘It’s one of
those times when kids really get
to know each other.”’

Aida Doss was a house-sitter
last summer. “I paid $45 rent
for two months and had the run
of the whole house.’”’’ She ob-

served that several students did
this because “‘lots of professors
do research and travel.”’

She too enjoyed getting to

“46 I aide ot the

Sallie Summey and Laea
Brown worked ss waitresses at
Ham and Eggs while taking
classes at UNCC. Summey said
hers was ‘‘a quiet summer. You
had to look harder to find things
to do. But, it’s fun,” she added,
‘‘because you~get a whole
different perspective on the
town. It was strange seeing all
of the students come back in the
fall.’’

Brown agrees that Davidson

was quiet, but ‘‘we had the lake

campus and gym.’’ She added
that one of the drawbacks was
that, “Everyone was working
irregular hours, so it was diffi-
cult to get together.’’

The Davidson community
was able to integrate students
in several activities. The David-
son community players put on
two theatrical performances and
invited students to work back-
stage.

Town Day, July 4, was a big
day for everyone in the com-
munity. Butler thought the 4th
of July “the best day of the
whole summer —real small-town
U.S.A.!”’ Activities included a
parade and field day.
