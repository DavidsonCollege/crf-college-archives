personality, character, and habits, but most
important of them was, what can you do?
He said that the manager of the branch
office in New York expressed the wish. that
he had attended instead the
large university where he studied, because
he believed that he would have derived more
real benefit from his education at a smaller
institution.

He advised the students to go out into
the world and fit themselves into their re-
spective niches and be somebody, trying to
do more than just get along. He related the
story of a famous Scotch coach who had his
men train for running the mile by having
them run three-fourths of the way on muscle
and the remainder “on man.”

Mr. Ovens stressed the importance of be
ing upright and looking ahead of the crowd
and refusing to be merely seconders of the
motion. He admitted that the law called the

never before. His narration of a story about
a faithful Eskimo dog who became too old
for further service to the Byrd expedition
was very effective. When the dog’saw them

Movies Taking Place
Of Books in Homes

Philadelphia, Pa—(IP)—Declaring that
popular interest in books is declining, Booth
Tarkington, novelist who is now recovering
his sight, asserts that reading in the home
is about to be replaced by home talking pic-
tures, and that the writer of the future will
have to devote himself to writing script for
the talki¢s if he hopes to continue his trade.

“When one can press a button and turn
on a good play or vocalized movie on the
home screen,” Tarkington said, “there will
be little time for reading. Certainly, there
has been a gradual decline in reading for a
long time. Times are materially changed
from the days when the only diversion of
the pioneer and farmer was a good book.
Editors’ tell me more people than ever read
books because of the increase in population,
but a very much smaller percentage ‘ot the
population reads books than formerly.

Literary Societies

Philanthropic
program scheduled by the Philan-

Artistic Evaluation of Chambers Building.

The program of the Eumanean Literary
