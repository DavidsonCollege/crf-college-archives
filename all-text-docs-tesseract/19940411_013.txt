~ And the freshman writing award winners are. ..

By Scott McLean

‘The creme de la creme of
freshmen writers at Davidson along
with faculty and members of the
community gathered together this
past Thursday night for the an-
nouncement of the annual Fresh-
men Writing Award winners. The
award is given in memory of R.
Windley Hall 63, by his family
and friends to those who show the
most promise in poetry, non-fic-
tion, or fiction.

Judging this year’s entries was
Dannye Romine Powell, a colum-

nist forthe Charlotte Observerwho
_is about to publish a compilation of
her interviews with a number of
renowned Southern authors.
Powell shared with the audience
the advice she had reaped from her
interviews on how a writer can
keep his work from being boring:
Trust your subconscious (Eudora

Welty), write to please yourself.

(T.R. Pierson), a good piece of
writing should be able to be read
aloud and enjoyed (Kay Gibbons),
and a writer should always try to
find follow his own passions (Doug

Marlett);

Commenting that this year’s
entries were anything but boring,
Powell announced the winners.
Honorable mentions went to
Nicholas Marston (fiction), Kristen
Richardson (non-fiction), and
Ashley Wright (poetry). There
was a tie for second place between
Jennifer McGillan for her poem
“The Love Song of Hortense P.
Willard” and John Cowan, who
wrote an essay about his barber
entitled, surprisingly enough,
“More than Just a Barber.” This

year’s first place winner was John
Copenhaver. John wrote a fic-
tional story about a man réturning
to his prep school haunts called
“And Seven to Go On.”

Awards for upperclassmen
will be handed out on April 19
when North Carolina author and
Cornell professor Robert Morgan
will be the guest. All writing en-
thusiasts should attend this event

‘ to hear excerpts from the winning

entries. If the awards were any
indication of the talent here, you
might say, “I knew them when....”

The internationally recognized

Irish poet will speak at 7:30

Kimi continued from page 10

In La Cantatrice Clauve, an
allusion to lonesco’s The Bald So-
prano, the artist exposes the “ab-
surdity of a mechanized, imper-
sonal society.” No Depth Percep-
tion, a lithograph, again comments
on mechanized society, as Kim
portrays an individual whose face
is smashed against a photocopier
by the machine world. Both works
make a powerful statement on the
individual and his/her enslavement
to the machines of modern society.

The exhibit is composed pri-

mprily of still-lifes and self-por-

traits. Much of his work is repre-
sentational in nature.

ality and common still-lifes, Kim
uses his bright colors and bizarre
combinations of objects.

will be on display in the Smith Gallery until April 22.

"Indian Outlaw"remains number one song

Radiocontinued from pagel0

for the truck. But, honestly, who
could imagine my big, blue
Wagoneer with a good stereo?
Currently our only option is to
pack up for the small town Ameri-
can South.! was born in Atlanta,
and Davidson's the only other place
lever really lived. All I knew until
this trip was big city radio. Don’t
get me wrong—I knew good coun-
try existed. I just thought it seldom
made it to the air waves. Well, the
kindly folks of South Georgia,
Middle Alabama, and Northern
Mississippi opened my eyes.

I heard Keith Whitley, old
George Jones, Patsy Cline, great

Dwight Yoakum, and Buck Owens.
I heard the Judds singing “Give a
“Little Love” on the radio for the
first time since Naomi left the music
industry. | heard.Marty Robbins’
“El Paso” for the first time since
my childhood! They even threw in
some Eagles and Allman Brothers
from time to time. No lists gov-
erned these stations’ air waves.
They just played good music.

And if the music wasn’t
enough, the DJs won our hearts. In
between songs we heard announce-
ments of which local teens will be
life-guarding the county pool this
summer and updates on the local
baseball game.

Even though many stations

have ranges extending for about
twenty or so miles, the next town
will invariably have something
similar. Only this time, you’ll be
hearing about the grand opening of
Stella’s beauty salon and Mrs.
Dyer’s pecans for sale—six dol-
lars a grocery bag.

Well, I’m back at Davidson,
and the radio’s still the same. I
think the number-one song in Char-
lotte this week is “Indian Outlaw”
and it makes me sick. The num-
ber-one in Selma right now is prob-
ably “Chill ofan Early Fall.” Alas,
what can I do but pop in George
Strait’s “Greatest Hits Volume
One” and daydream of a happier
time in a happier place?
