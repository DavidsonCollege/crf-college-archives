goes green

The Davidson College Din-
ing Services have been making a
strong push recently toward greater
environmental sustainability. While
several environmentally-minded
policies have been in place for sev-
eral years, “The last year we’ve
made an even bigger push to be
even more sustainable,” Dee Phil-
lips, Director of Dining Services,
said.

A composting center for the
campus is currently the biggest
project being pursued. Accord-
ing to President Tom Ross, all the
waste from the Union Café as well
as the food waste from Vail Com-
mons will be composted once the
center is running.

An exact timetable is uncertain,
due to permit regulations and ma-
chine orders, but “we hope to get
it operating sometime...hopefully
by the end of the [calendar] year,”
Ross said.

Ross mentioned several poten-
tial benefits for the campus. Com-
posting the majority of the waste
will reduce the weight of trash
headed to the landfill, saving Da-
vidson College money and reduc-
ing landfill volume.

There is only one trash dump-

New choco-
late shop in

ster outside of Vail Commons that
is picked up 3 times per week. The
number of dumpsters has been re-
duced over the years by Dining
Services’ efforts to reduce waste
and increase recycling.

“We’re hoping once the com-
posting starts we can actually drop
off one or two pickups,” Phillips
said.

In addition to saving landfill
tonnage, Ross also said that the
composting will eliminate the need
to purchase compost from an out-
side source.

This project will present an
initial cost to the college, but Ross
said that he thinks the project will
ultimately pay for itself through
saving costs in other areas.

No matter the initial cost, “The
environmental savings make it cer-
tainly worth the effort,” Ross said.

While composting is certainly
the biggest project in the works,
Dining Services also uses bio-
degradable disposable products
manufactured from sugar, corn or
potato by-products. Specifically,
the disposable knives, forks, and
spoons are made from potato starch.

gone to using reusable red plastic
baskets for in-house dining, and the

Students were invited to experi-
ence the mind/body connection at
Exhale, last Friday’s event which
promoted stress-relief and relax-
ation. The air of the Alvarez Stu-
dent Union Atrium was perfumed
with essential oils, ipod speakers
played a soothing soundtrack and
the floor was covered with yoga
mats.

FL.Y. (a student group that pro-
motes positive body image and eat-
ing disorder awareness) provided
hot tea for students to sip while they
decided which mode of relaxation
they would partake in; Anusura
Yoga, meditation, massage, Tai Chi
and acupuncture were among the
offerings. Exhale was coordinated
by yoga instructor Kelley Gardner,
Health Advisor Georgia Ringle and
Jamie Brown and Ashley Kaufman
of Lulemon Athletica.

Brown and Kaufman are alum-
ni of Davidson and represented Lu-
lemon Athletica, a yoga and athlet-
ic-wear company which, according
to its promotional materials, aims
to “create components for people

Showing off summer research

Sixty-eight students and their 3

faculty mentors exhibited the fruits
of collaborative summer research

at a symposium in Lilly Family ;
Gallery this past Thursday. Stu- 3

dents and professors alike ex-
plained oversized posters detailing
each group’s research. The event
was the culmination of 70 faculty-
student projects in disciplines rang-
ing from legal history to genetics.
The Davidson Research Initiative
(DRD, a program designed to foster
in-depth study between faculty and
students, supported 20 of the stu-
dents involved with funding from
The Duke Endowment.

“The unique thing about the
Davidson Research Initiative is
that we are encouraging collabora-
tive student-faculty research in the

social sciences and humanities, as :

fun life.”

By giving a goal setting work-
shop, Brown and Kaufman pro-
vided some of these components to
Davidson students and also handed
out posters and bags printed with
lululemon’s manifesto. Kaufman
explained her attraction to the idea
of Exhale, saying that it struck her
as an event that she would have
benefitted from when she was a
Davidson student.

Georgia Ringle commented on
the assortment of services, say-
ing that “all are local resources

The Edmund Center of Corne-
lius provided two masseuses who
massaged students for four hours
straight.

Martin Kestin gave workshops
in partner massage to make mas-
sage a viable stress-relief option
even for students, whose funds and
time are notoriously tight.
