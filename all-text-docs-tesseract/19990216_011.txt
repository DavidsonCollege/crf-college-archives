THE DAVIDSONIAN

L€é& A H Y

The 1998-99 Davidson College Artist Series
will stage its third event of the year on Monday,
February 22 in Love Auditorium.

“Please tell me it’s not going to be another °

drama thing. I mean, Brian Bedford was swell and
all, but mostly just because he appeared on ‘Cheers’
and has probably met Norm. And then ‘Tartuffe’
got cancelled, only to be replaced by ‘Twelfth
Night.’ It’s high time we had one of those new
age, quasi-Celtic abstract performance troupes
that get naked on stage and spit fire and stuff.”

I totally agree with you. That’s why I’m
pleased to announce that the Canadian, quasi-
Celtic band Leahy is coming to Love Auditorium
on Monday, just in time to scratch that Winter
Solstice itch that we’ve all been enduring for
months new.

Although Leahy remains fully clothed and
refrains from use of incendiary devices during
their concerts, they have still nearly climbed to the
apex of the Billboard world music charts - as high
as #4 with their self-titled CD “Leahy.” No small
feat, “Leahy” eclipsed both the pompous Michael
Flatley’s “Lord of the Dance” (#15) and Mandy
“My name is Inigo Montoya. . . You killed my
father. .. Prepare to die” Patinkin’s “Mamaloshen”
(#11).

What makes Leahy so popular? 1.) They’re
Canadian, and their album went platinum in
Canada. 2.) Their fiddler, Donnell Leahy, is
purported to be one of the world’s greatest. He
could probably even pull off “The Devil Went
Down to Georgia” and “Ants Marching.” He is
just that sassy.

The opening track on their current CD sounds
alot like Tori Amos meets your average backbeat-
infested Ceili band, but it quickly turns into a
rosinfest for Donnell, who is clearly the center of
attention of the group.

Said group is comprised of Donnell and eight
of his Leahy brothers and sisters, ranging in age
from 19 to 32. All of them are into stepdancing,
which you will see them do quite a lot of if and
when you head to Love Auditorium on Monday at
8:00 (or is it 8:15) p.m. to see the show. Not only
are they all talented musicians and dancers, but
they all sport the patented Leahy “raven-haired
good looks,” to quote one critic. Bring some
binoculars and judge for yourself.

The band’s immense popularity has allowed
them to tour with the likes of Shania Twain and the
Chieftains, godfathers of Irish folk music.

So for anyone interested in absorbing riotous
stomping of feet and a myriad of piano, fiddle, and
drum strains, head over to Love Auditorium on
Monday. And watch out for the beer cans left over
from the Bela.Fleck concert.

ton elephant . . . using only his
teeth! All of these extraordinary
individuals are sensationally show-
cased in this year’s production of
the Greatest Show on Earth™!

Death-defying displays of
strength, skill, an spirit are ex-
pertly elocuted by Ringmaster Jim
Ragona. The fleet-footed Quiros
of Spain demonstrates unparalleled
balance and bravado atop the
highwire. Precocious pintsize
pachyderms Benjamin and Shirley
amaze and amuse with their remarkable repertoire
of tricks. The three amazing Ayala sisters hang by
only their hair, high above the hippodrome.

Exuberant acrobats from Gabon in central
Africa, a daring duo bravely blasted from colossal
cannon, Olympic silver medal-winning rhythmic
gymnasts from Bulgaria and, of course, awesome
elephants and magnificent tigers. The world fa-
mous Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey clowns
round out the roster of gasps and guffaws.

This all-new Edition of the Greatest Show on
Earth not only invites audiences to see wonders
from around the world, but ticket holders may also
experience the world of the circus up close and
personal, one hour before every performance. Chil-

dren of All Ages are invited down onto the arena ©

Poetry in the Nuyorican style

Continued from previous page

Originally known as Nuyorican Poets, they
named themselves after a poets’ and writers’ hub
in Manhattan’s Lower East Side called the
Nuyorican Poets Cafe. This cafe, which existed
from the mid-’70’s to 1982 was resurrected in
1988 with an adventurous spirit. The atmosphere
of the cafe came to Davidson for the first time two
years ago. It returned at 8:00 p.m. on Friday.

The first of the three performers was
Samantha Coerbell. She calls both New York and
Trinidad & Tobago home. As the youngest of the
poets, her credits include the anthology Aloud!
Voices From the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. Fresh-
man Steven Ballantyne said of Coerbell’s perfor-
mance that, “‘she isn’t afraid to just say what she
feels. She seemed to connect with me.” Her show-
stealing performance of ‘“‘Breezing through J.
Crew” battered the 900 Room with humor while
also exposing the diffi-

performance as soon as he stepped to the micro-
phone when he acted out a poem which relied
‘purely on the sound of words. It did not contain one
coherent statement. Edwin’s work is also found in
Aloud!, and he has published the book J Hear
Things People Haven’t Really Said and the CD
Holy Kid. He has also appeared on MTV’s Spoken
Word Unplugged. He is a poet that must not only
be heard but seen, as his most well received poem
on Friday, the extremely visual “Indian Hand
Poem,” can attest.

Each of the poets also gave their own work-
shop on Friday and dined with students after their
8:00 performance. Almost as soon as they flew in,
they flew back out to destinations unknown. Al-
though gone, if their message continues to be
heard,.we may begin to see and hear poetry echo over
the buildings instead of merely being bound in them.

models they see in cata-
logues.
