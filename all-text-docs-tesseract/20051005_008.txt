The controversy over whether or
not students should be allowed
into science buildings after 1 a.m.
took a new twist last week when
Campus Safety revealed new data
concerning the buildings. In addi-
tion to the cost of keeping the
lights and air conditioning systems
operational during the night
hours, the Martin Chemistry build-
ing is apparently haunted.

Officer Brian Jones thinks it is
unsafe for students to linger in the
building after 1 a.m.

“The ghosts have been mighty
restless as of late with all these stu-
dents trying to stay up late in their
labs,” said Jones. “I’ve seen quite a
few beakers broken and tables
overturned in the last week. If a
student happens to be working at
this time there’s a chance they
might get a sliver of glass in their
eye or their foot smashed by a
table. That’s a risk we don’t want to
run.”

If students leave the building by
one o'clock, however, Campus
Safety doesn’t think there will be
any incidents. “The ghosts don’t
really get to work until after one,”
said officer Leslie O’Donnell. “Like
the students, they put off starting
their work until late at night. So
students should be safe as long as
we can get them out by the set
deadline.”

Some students have also wit-
nessed paranormal activity in the

Recently-shot night-vision photograph of Martin Chemistry Building

building when they tried to finish
their labs. “Once I was finishing up
a chemical analysis lab when I
noticed something odd on the mir-
ror above the safety eye wash foun-
tain,” said Rob West ’07. “It: turns
out that one of the ghosts had tried
to scare me away from the lab by
writing ‘Your GPA is too low for
med school’ in blood.”

Other students are more skepti-
cal of the reports of ghosts in the
science buildings, however. Some
even doubt the existence of ghosts
at all. “I don’t buy all this super-
natural-mumbo-jumbo that the
administration is feeding us,” said
Katherine Barnes ’o6. “I think they
are just coming up with lame
excuses to make it tougher for us
to do our work.”

No one is exactly sure why the
science building is haunted, but
there are several prevalent theo-
ries. Some students think the
ghosts are past Davidson students
that have come back to warn the
present Chemistry majors against
choosing the pre-med track.

“One of the ghosts introduced
himself to me as an alumnus who
wasted his entire life away doing
labs in this building,” said
Elizabeth ings ’08. “He warned
me not to do pre-med because it
would eat up all my free time at
Davidson. He also urged me to
enjoy simple pleasures like breath-
ing and eating, which now, as a
ghost, he realized he took for
granted. Also, his head kept falling
off.”

Some students think the ghosts

-have more sinister intentions.

“The ghost I saw tripped me and
then threw all the lab equipment
into the trashcan,” said Jim
Daughtery ’07. “Then, on top of
that, he shredded my lab report
that I had spent hours working on.
These ghosts clearly are jealous of
our human senses and ability to
tangibly interact with the physical
world.”

While Campus Safety assured
the student body that there would
be no problems as long as they
cleared out of the building by 1
a.m., some students wish for a

‘Your GPA is too

school in blood.”

more long-term solution.

“Sometimes I am so busy that I
can’t even start my homework
until one o’clock,” said Justin
Howard ’08. “Campus Safety
needs to get those ghosts out of
there for good; they aren’t even
paying tuition. I don’t know who
they’re gonna call, but it needs to
be soon.’

RLO demands bribes for better housing lottery numbers

This week several freshmen
reported what they perceive to be
threatening messages from RLO.
The messages came either in e-
mails or in letters delivered to
campus mailboxes, but all of them
contained the same proposition.

“Basically, the letter offered me
the chance to pay RLO 500 dollars
to ensure that I get a lottery num-
ber that will put me up-the-hill
next year,” explained Ted Quincy
09.

At least 12 other freshmen
received such notifications,
although only a few were willing to
give their names.

One of the anonymous students
said, “I’ve heard stories about the
sophomore apartments; I don’t
want to risk RLO getting angry at
me for ratting them out and stick-
ing me with a really bad number.”

The other anonymous students
suggest there may be even more
out there who received this propo-
sition, but will not say so in public
for fear of vindication.

When asked about this issue,
Dean .of Residence Life Jamie
Wilco answered, “Such a situation,
were it to occur, would indeed be a
problem. I am unaware at this time
of any evidence other than some
campus rumors that would sub-
stantiate this claim. For the
moment, RLO has our hands full
with such neverending tasks as

moral turpitude that they repre-

“They will have to fix the air sys-
tems in Irwin, Akers, and Knox

sooner or later, and that will cost
money,” said Anna Roswell ’o7.

Regina Linville ’09 has already
stated that she intends to pay the
five hundred dollars to buy a better

lottery number. “Whether it’s right
or wrong, it’s the system that con-
trols our lives. I’m not about to get
stuck in a moldy, poorly heated
dorm room just because I don’t
want to pay protection money.”

Many students have reported
unfavorable consequences’ to
ignoring the alleged RLO demand
for protection money. ~

Jimmy Newmann ‘og reported
that he caught an RLO employee
in a pinstriped suit shuffling his
class notes around and removing
the staples from his stapler.

Another student, who wished to
remain anonymous, reported that
a suspicious man smoking a cigar
and holding a tommy gun changed
his network password.

Now that the issue is out in the
open, a few upperclassmen have
reported that they received similar
offers during their freshman year.

Bobby Norris ’08 said, “RLO
offered to give me a bigger email
quota and a carpeted floor if I paid
them $700 and signed up for the
19-meal plan. The only problem
was that I didn’t get any bonus
bucks, so I declined.” .

When Davidsonian reporters
tried to find Wilco.to ask him
about this additional piece of evi-
dence, they were told that he was
unavailable and would be engaged
in alumni-related activities for the
two weeks following Homecoming.
