Counselors arrive |

The new year at Davidson

promises. not only new prob-

lems but also new ways of

dealing with these problems.

‘These ‘‘answers’’ come in the

form of Davidson’s new psy-
chological cotitselors Dr. Bar-
bara R. Ballard, director of
Psychological Services at Gas-
ton-Lincoln Area Mental
Health and John Wheeler,
Director of Psychological Ser-
vices at the Center for Human
Development in Mecklenburg
County.

Both counselors attended
the University of South Caro-
lina and, according to Will
Terry, are highly respected by
their professional peers.

Husband. and wife, Ballard
and Wheeler are currently
living and practicing in Char-
lotte. Each plans to be avail-
able on alternate days in the
Davidson Counseling Center,
from Tuesday through Friday.
Services may also be provided
one evening a week.

Wheeler and Terry are both

quick to emphasize that the
psychologists offer an impor-
tant service to Davidson and
they encourage students to
take full advantage of the
service.

As Wheeler expressed, ‘‘I’m
not here to take the place of a
friend or advisor but I am here
to talk to anyone who needs to
straighten out their thoughts’’
or as Terry put it, ‘‘To help us
over the rough spots.”

Wheeler and Ballard have
already spoken to the faculty
advisors and plan to visit with
various student groups in the
next few weeks, introducing
themselves and explaining
their services.

Another addition to the
counseling center is psychol-

‘ogy professor Webster. As a

faculty member, he will serve
as an additional source to
which students may turn for
counseling.

Other new faces in the
medical field this year are the
five doctors who will be on sick
call on weekdays at the In-
firmary.

These are Doctors Alex
Sanchez, Van Stitt, and Wil-
liam Williams, all residents in
family practice in the Char-
lotte-Mecklenburg _hospital;
Dr. Larry Silverburg, present
ly practicing in Charlotte, and
Dr. Lewis Sigmon, director of
the family practice program in
the Charlotte-Mecklenburg

hospital.
Because of their other com-
mitments the doctors’ hours

will be rather irregular, but a
nurse will always be on duty.
During the weekends all Dav
idson students will be referred
to the Mooresville hospital in
cases of emergency.

Terry expects the medical
care to be much more consis-
tent in the future; however.
Next year two former Davids-
on students plan to set up a
practice in the Davidson com-
munity and they cater to
student needs. Until then,
however, the prevailing atti-
tude seems to be that ‘‘the
quality of service will not
suffer—only the continuity of
coverage,”’ said Terry.

Freshman trauma will evaporate

By MERIDETH DURDEN
Staff Writer

College freshmen are now submer-
ged in a period of emotional tran-
sition, according to Davidson’s two
new psychological counselors Mr.
John T. Wheeler and his wife Dr.
Barbara Ballard. As soon as freshmen
feel comfortable with college, their
past personality will reemerge basic-
ally unaltered.

But for the moment apprehension is
a very real problem, said the couple.
“Not only is Davidson unknown to
the student, but the student is
unknown to Davidson,” said Wheel-

er. ‘‘The impact of the situation is
just that—going from the known to
the unknown.”

Dr. Ballard explained that fresh-
men are insecure about their ability to
do college work. They feel that college
will be much more difficult than high
school. “‘In our society there is what
we call the ‘halo effect’. In high school
this effect may manifest itself when a
student exhibits one positive charac-
teristic, like intelligence, as is tended
to be seen as having other good qual-
ities, like creativity and poise,’’ she
said.

The halo effect occurs at college and

in a lot of other situations, but a
freshman may feel that it is unique to
their past and that they really aren’t
prepared for college, she said.

“Once the halo effect is established
a person has some built in alibis. For
example, an established high school
student who performs poorly does not
suffer anyetong-term detrimental ef-
fects. People excuse it as a ‘bad day’.
When a person comes to college they
have to build an entirely new reputa-
tion. There is no sense of ease here,”’
said Mrs. Ballard.

Mr. Wheeler explained that the
chance to change at college is an
exciting prospect to freshmen. ‘‘You
can be anything you want to be and
that is a bit frightening,’’ he said.

Students feel that they don’t
belong when they are thrown into a
campus where upperclassmen seem to
have their niches and fellow freshmen
seem gracefully ready to slide into
their own. A fear of failure is strong
until the student tests himself, said
the couple.

Dr. Ballard talked about another
area which produces anxiety among
freshmen. ‘“‘When we have a fantasy
or goal, we sometimes have a hard
time coping with the fact that we
actually reach it. College is itself a
landmark situation and, as a college,
Davidson has a reputation for being
both selective and demanding.”’

Mr. Wheeler explained how stu-
dents react- when thrown into a stress-
ful situation. ‘‘When people move into
an unknown situation, they tend to
act under ‘security operations’. That
means they act according to the

strategies or patterns that have been
successful with them before,’’ he said.

In that sense the Ciass uwwu of
high school may find himself the
college clown. And the freshman that
uses studying as an escape from other

people is acting in a tried and true

pattern, he said.

There are certain big questions
which are sticking in each freshman’s
mind, said the counselors. ‘‘Will I be
OK here?”’ ‘‘Will the people at college
be receptive like the people in high
school?”

“Tt is a fantasy that freshmen
especially are prone to, the myth that

the world is different from here,’’ said

Mr. Wheeler. In many respects
college is like the real world and in
many more ways it is like high school,
he said.

“Students think that new class-
mates and professors are somehow
different from the people they knew
before. But they’re not,’’ Wheeler
added.

Usually wher a student realizes
that college is a lot like the world
they’ve known before, they relax and
settle in. ‘‘When people first come to
college they expect a big change to
occur, though they know that inside
they are the same. It is an affirmatio
of who you are when you accept
yourself as the same person,’’ said
Wheeler.

Wheeler said that the sense of not
belonging is natural in a new situation
and offered some assurance to fresh-
men. ‘‘Most people who get to
Davidson probably should be here,’
he said.
