Early decision applications surge;

By KEITH FINCH

A 76% increase in the number
of early-decision applicants and a
projected 20% increase in the
number of regular decision appli-
cants could make Davidson one of
the most selective schools in the
nation, according to figures re-
leased by the- Office of Admis-
sions this week.

“There’s a 90% probability that
our total admit rate will drop to
around 24% this year, if we can
keep up our momentum,” said
Robert Gardner, Dean of Admis-
ffons and Financial Aid. “That’s
‘down from 35% last year.”

Gardner attributes the increase
in selectivity mostly to the surge
in applications for early-decision
admission, which increased in
number from 123 last year to 217
this year. By accepting 110 early-
decision applicants (as compared
with 77 last year) Davidson
should be able to reduce the
number of regular-decision ac-
ceptances from 703 to around 550.

Gardner explained that since

only about half of the regular-
decision applicants who are ac-

_cepted actually decide to attend—

mustadmit twice as many regular-
decision applicants as it needs to
fill the freshman class. Since
early-decision applicants are sure
to attend Davidson, however, an
“admit” granted in the fall means
that a place in the freshman class
has been assured of being filled.
This year’s dramatic increase in
early-decision applications al-
lowed Davidson to choose a third
of next year’s class before Christ-
mas, so that the regular-decision
applicants will meet with much
stiffer competition and
Davidson’s “selectivity index”
will jump.

Davidson has also had the op-
portunity this year to be more
choosy in its selection of early-
decision candidates, and the sta-
tistical indicators of the accepted
applicants’ “quality” have risen as
a result. The median combined
SAT score of the entering early-

decision applicants has increased
30 points, to 1220, and their
median class rank has risen 4
percent.

The surge in early-decision
applications has been accompa-
nied by an increase in the number
of regular-decision applications.
Itis expected that the total number
of applications received will

reach 2400 this year, an increase
of 19 percent. Of these less than a
quarter will be accepted, while
last year Davidson accepted more
than a third of the 2013 students
who applied.

The nation’s most selective
schools accept between 15% and
25% of those who apply for ad-
mission, according to authorita-

tive college guides such as
Barron's Profiles of American
Colleges. If Davidson’s total
admit rate (also known as the
applicant-to-space ratio) does
indeed drop to 24%, the college
may move from its current
