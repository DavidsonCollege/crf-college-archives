here are some dark areas: by
Watts, especially right now
yetween Carnegie Hall and
Little Dorm.

“The officers are out on

another, they have no way of

take your stereo while you’re
eating or at a ball game. It’s the
people with idealistic atti-
tude who are going to get
burned. Idealism is fine, but
some people have their heads in
the clouds.”
_ One area where the Senate
security council can serve its
educational function, as
Watford sees it, is in correcting
prevalent student misconcep-
tions concerning rape phones.
He noted that ‘‘most people
think they’re the kind that work
just by knocking the receiver off
the wall. They’re not. It’s hard
to describe a guy’s eye color
over the phone while you’re
being raped.”

Watford favors installation of

the more efficient phones which
demand less than a superhuman
effort on the part of the rapee.

In general, however, Wat-
ford admits that in the area of
changing students’ overtrusting
attitudes toward security his
work is cut out for him.

‘‘Changing the attitudes of
students on, say, locking doors
will be tough in view of the open
campus idea which I personally
feel is one of Davidson’s most
attractive features. We’re not
insulting anyone here. Everyone
knows my door is locked, but
that doesn’t mean it’s closed to
friends.’

Outlining general security
council plans, Watford added,
‘‘we’re going to come up with

some recommendations, talk to
Will Terry, and then present our
recommendations to Grover
Meetze.

“He’s willing to adjust police
finances in order to work our
recommendations, if they’re
good enough, into the budget,
and even to scrap all existing
security programs and start
over. The police are serious
about helping.

“After the recommendation
stage and hopefully some imple-
mentation, we’re going to keep
an eye on the police, evaluate
their effectiveness, and make
sure they’re keeping their prom-
ises. Just knowing that we’re
checking them out ought to
help.

‘We've got to face facts. The
fact is that there is a security
problem on campus. What we
want to do is first find out how
grave a problem we're dealing
with.”’

Still, wary of overdramatize-
tion this early in the Senate’s
investigation, Watford added,
‘‘We don't want to blow it out of
proportion, but neither do we
want to minimize it. We hope to
come up with suggestions and
recommendations to alleviate
these problems and in this
regard we're looking for student
input and ideas.

“The problem isn’t rampant,
but I'll tell you, if we don’t do
something, it soon will be ram-
pant.

Town crime rises;
force expands

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
Asst. News Editor

In spite of a surge of crime
in Davidson over the past six
months, local police officials
are not alarmed.

Break-ins at the Peregrine
House Etcetera, Pika, the
Davidson Bookstore, and an
armed robbery at Parks Diugs
have all occurred since Aug-
ust. °

But Davidson Chief of Pol-
ice R. H. Mills says this crime
wave is simply a phase of a
“cycle’’. He explained, “You
have this rash of break-ins
that seem to run in cycles. In
the last six months, we’ve
been hit harder than ordinar-
ily; but this kind of thing
(crime wave) may not happen
again for a year. You just have
to stay on your toes and do the
very best you can.”

When asked why he thought
Davidson was_ suffering
through such a corrupt period,
Mills replied, ‘‘Well, this is
Christmas holidays; you us-
ually have more of it during
holidays, you might say from
October through January.
You usually have more (crime)
then than you do any other
time of the year. In the spring
of the year they don’t seem to
be as bad.”

The Davidson Police De-
partment, without a detective
division, is forced to hand a
good deal of their investiga
tions over to the Mecklenburg
County Police Department
and other departments in the
surrounding area. In most
cases, the stolen property is
not recovered, especially the
cash.

Nancy Kennédy, store man-
ager of Ecetera, also doubts
that the clothes stolen from
that store on January 5 will be
recovered. She expressed the
reasons. for her doubts, ‘The
police say that when things
like that happen, they (the

thieves) take it out of state.
They don’t sell it locally,
because then maybe they
could get caught. There's a lot
of stores that would carry the
same line, becduse Levi and
Wrangler are brand names,
and also Male. They took a lot
of Male jackets.”’

In that particular case,
there was some confusion as to
whether the alarm had soun-
ded. Kennedy said that the
police had told her that the
alarm didn’t sound when Ece-
tera was broken into. How-
ever, when the crime lab
arrived, they found that the
battery which powers the al-
arm was so hot that it couldn’t
be handled without: gloves,

- indicating that the alarm had

been on for quite some time.
Mills said that the officer
who discovered the break-in
did not hear the alarm at all,
but merely saw the damage in
the rear of the store during a
routine-check about 3:45 am.
When asked for his answer
to the controversy, Mills ex-
plained that the alarm proba-
bly was on, but some malfunc-
tion kept it from ringing. He
could not say whether the
malfunction was tampered
with or just a coincidence.

Opinion

Open eyes needed

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor

The friend of a Davidson student
arrived on campus unexpectedly one
night at 3 am. He searched for 45
minutes to find a security personnel
for directions to the student’s off-
campus, college-owned house. He
finally found security. But the patrol-
man did not even know the location of
the house.

He was trying to find security and
could not. What if he were a thief and
weren’t trying?

Patrolmen relaxing in the snack
bar, in their patrol cars, only contri-
butes to our low-key security atmos-
phere.

But do students want it any other
way? Evidence points to a general
feeling of apathy among the students
toward tightening security measures,

They leave doors open; they fail to
lock windows; they walk alone to the
post office at 2 am; they do not bother
to report thefts. They act in sucha
way as to say, ‘‘We go to Davidson,

the utopia where theft is a joke, rape
is impossible, and the only time we
think about the police is when they
pull us for D.U.I.”

Students are unaware of the possi-
bility that something might happen.
And students will not want more
security until something does happen.

We have options. We could re-ex-
amine the Centrex phone system so
any student could have immediate
access to a phone in case of emer-
gency. We could install a better
security phone system which could be
activated by simply knocking the
receiver off the hook. We could go as
far as setting up a desk-controlled
system whereby non-students would
be checked in the lobby.

These measures seem drastic. Do
we want tq sacrifice our present
relaxed feeling for more intense
security? No. So how do we compro-
mise?

Security can, be tightened without
instituting a prison. Patrolmen could
do more patrolling. Students could
lock their-doors during games. They
could also begin a systemized watch
over the halls during games and other
campus-wide activities.

But first they could become aware.
Before they are raped, robbed, or
ripped off, they should at least think
through what measures they want to
take before measures are implemented
for them. The college cannot protect
its students against their own stupid-

ity.

SOME STUDENTS feel security uses wheels more than feet.
