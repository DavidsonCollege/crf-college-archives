Potential NFL players descended upon
Indianapolis to participate in the annual NFL
Draft Combine last week. The combine
consists of several components that are de-
signed to help scouts determine how effec-
tive a player will be in the NFL. Hundreds
of potential draftees enter the combine after
months of preparation with the hope of im-
proving their draft stock.

Combine week is a veritable heaven for
NFL draft gurus everywhere. Pundits analyze
prospects’ times in the 40-yard dash down to
the hundredth of a second. For example, a
time of 4.59 for a tailback means the prospect
has breakaway speed. A time of 4.60 means
that the prospect might not be fast enough to
run away from linebackers and get into the
second level of a defense. Read that again.
I’m serious. Pundits make a huge deal out of
a guy running a 4.6 versus a 4.59.

Never mind that players do not even wear
pads during the combine drills. Forget the
years of college film that have shown what
they can actually do on the field. The com-
bine has become extremely important, and
no one knows it better than the prospects.

I am here to tell you that the combine
workout should have very little effect on
a player’s draft status. The workout at the
combine is the NFL’s version of the SAT.
Perhaps it used to tell scouts something about
the athleticism and ability of a player. I do

not discount this possibility.

This, however, is no longer the case.
Players spend months now preparing for
these workouts. Like the SAT, combine
workouts have come to indicate mostly how
well a player prepared for the workout and
the types of exercises performed in front of
the scouts. They no longer measure actual
athletic ability, but rather the ability to ma-
nipulate the system.

There are countless stories of “workout
warriors” that struggle in the pros. Last year,
Appalachian State Wide Receiver Dexter
Jackson wowed scouts with a forty time un-
der 4.30. He parlayed that performance into
a second-round selection by the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. Perhaps Jackson should have
remained on the track instead of the field,
however, as he did not catch a single pass and
struggled with running routes in his rookie
season. Make no mistake; the Bucs were not
exactly a team stacked with receiving talent
either.

It does not only work in one direction,
however. Several years ago, Anquan Boldin
of Florida State saw his stock plummet af-
ter running a time of 4.7. What is he doing
now? He’s one of the top receivers in the
league and had the greatest rookie season in
NFL history. He’s not the only success story,
though. Jerry Rice, the greatest Wide Re-
ceiver ever to play the game, also clocked in
at 4.7. What do all these success stories have
in common? They happened in college. Col-
lege performance is still the best indicator of

professional success. If a player struggles
to produce in college, he will likely struggle
even worse at the professional level.

Scouts need to realize that there must be
some reason that a player did not produce in
college and do their best to figure out why.
Maybe the reason is legitimate. Or maybe
the player cannot handle it when the pads
come on and the whistle blows.

I do not believe that all aspects of the
combine are bad. I do think that interviewing
players should be an important component
of any team’s draft board. Personnel men
around the league can often tell if a player
is going to be a problem in the locker room
by observing and questioning him in an in-
terview.

Also, the physical exam is extremely im-
portant. Teams get to have their doctors ex-
amine whether or not a player is an injury risk
at the combine. This is an important practice
as franchises are about to invest millions of
dollars in a player without NFL experience.

While there are some positives, the NFL
Combine is generally overrated, overhyped,
and a poor measure of a prospect’s abilities
on a football field. Teams want to see how a
guy prepares and handles the pressure, but I
believe that they should almost disregard the
actual results of the workout.

College performance means so much
more, and there are countless examples. You
can take your Dexter Jackson and his 4.2. Pll
take a Jerry Rice or Anquan Boldin any day
of the week and twice on Sunday.

Wildcats pin Duquesne in regular season finale

In the final meet of the 2008-2009 wres-
tling regular season, the Wildcats came up
with a hefty 29-14 victory over Duquesne.
The meet was held on Sunday afternoon in
the Palumbo Center outside Pittsburgh, Pa.

The meet began with the 125 pound
match, as Ben Altman ’ 10 took on Duquesne’s
a Chamberlain. Chamberlain got the best

of Altman 10-0, and that gave the Dukes an
early 4-0 lead. That lead would not last for
very long, as the Wildcats won four of the
next five matches, three of which ended in
a pin. In the 133 pound match, Alex Radsky
’11 got the Wildcats on the scoreboard by
pinning Taylor Wilde in 2:24. That put the
Wildcats ahead of the Dukes 6-4. In the 141
pound match, Vitaly Radsky *11 defeated
Jayk Cobbs by a score of 15-9. This win in-

creased the Wildcat lead to 9-4. In the 149

Just when it looked as if the Wildcats
would run away with this match, the Dukes’
Nathan Reinhart defeated Carl Sandercock

The third and final Wildcat pin was accom-
plished by Tyler Mullen ’12 in the 165 pound
weight class. Mullen pinned Matt Gregg in
2:25, and this win pushed the Wildcat lead to
21-7. Duquesne’s Ryan Sula defeated Kevin
Cook ’09 12-3, and the result of that match
cut the Wildcat lead down to 21-11. Cook’s
classmate Sam O’Hair ’09 got the Wildcats
back on track with an 18-3 decision, which
once again pushed their lead to 26-11. In the
197 pound match, the Duke’s got closer to
Wildcats for the final time, as Scott Black de-
feated Jorge Estrada °12 6-3, which cut the
lead to 26-14. Charlie Wolff ’11 finished off
the match for the Wildcats, as he defeated
John Simmons 6-2, which made the final
tally 29-14. This was the final regular season
meet for Sam O’Hair and Kevin Cook, both
of whom had great careers as Wildcat Wres-
tlers.

The Wildcats’ season comes to an end
in two weeks (Mar. 7) when they travel to
Charleston, S.C. for the Southern Confer-
ence Championships.
