PLEASED AT PROSPECTS

Pleasure at returning to Davidson
and hope for a successful Y. M. C, A,
program the coming year was expressed
in an interview today with A. B. Me-
Clure, Davidson’s new secretary of the
“Y") McClure’s personal statement fol-
lows:

“It is:somewhat a strange feeling to
come back to the campus and find that
you know hardly any of the men, but
it is a great feeling to find that the
Davidson spirit is still living on, cher-
ished by the men who are now here.
We are expecting great things from
every man and are seeking the co-
operation of each to make this a good
year in the work of the “Y."” Come by
the office and let's talk things over and
get better acquainted.”

Stronger and more vesper
programs, increasd boys work and more
extensive deputations are the major ob-
jectives in the “Y” program. The ves-
per committee, headed by Bob Smith,
is attempting to bring speakers from
a wider area this year, The music de-
partment will be utilized to the fullest
extent in an effort to make the services
more effective.

A league of junior football teams is

musical

being planned and an assistant who
will take care of the © correspondence
makes 4 wider range of  deputations

possible.

McClure is not a neweomer to David-
son, having graduated here in 1931 after
four years of a prominent campus life.
He stood high in his class in scholarship
and was president of the Y. M. C. A.
his senior year. ‘The erection of the
mill chapel across the tracks is chiefly
due to his efforts. He graduated from
Union Seminary in 1934 and takes the
place of Sam S. Wiley, former secretary
who enters Union Theological Seminary
this fall.

Dr. Arbuckle Victim Of
Serious Heart Attack

The student body will be very sorry to
learn of the illness sustained by Doc-
tor Howard B, Arbuckle, Professor of
chemistry, during the summer. While
at his summer home in West Virginia
he suffered a serious heart attack and
was very sick for more than two weeks.
Later he was removed to the Charlotte
Sanatorium for treatment.

Dr. Arbuckle’s improvement
a great deal more rapid than we
for by his doctors, and he is expected
home on Tuesday. His condition
so much improved that he had planned
to come back Monday the seventeenth
buf unfortunately he exerted himself
too heavily and was forced to forego
his plans and rest for a day.

During the summer Doctor and Mrs.

Arbuckle made a two weeks’ trip
through New England, visiting various
spots of interest, among which were

Johns Hopkins University, which he had
not visited since he received his degree
there. It was just after they returned
that he had the heart attack; until that
time he had been in the best of health,
The summer home of the Arbuckles is
near Louisburg, West Virginia, only a
short distance from the beautiful White
Sulphur Springs. resort.

Since he first arrived at Davidson
College Doctor Arbuckle has been one
of the outstanding members of the fac-
ulty, and his absence is being felt
deeply. Before coming to Davidson he
was professor of chemistry at Agnes
Scott College for some years, during
which time he was instrumental in
founding the Georgia Section of the
American Chemical Society.

F reshmen Start Work
Of Erecting Bleachers

In accordance with the traditions of
Davidson College the first year men be-
gan work last Monday-on the erection
of the bleachers, to enlarge the seat-
ing capacity of the Richardson Memorial
Stadium.

Following a short talk by
Montgomery, the “slave-driver,”
freshman class responded willingly in
spirit, if not in body. In this talk
Montgomery outlined the essential facts
in connection with the work to be done.

To act as assistant, Dick Hayworth
was appointed to help in the manage-
ment of the freshmen.
