Hands Off.
Cecil Burney’s recent statement with the principles which

that the Davidson administration and
personnel are unwelcome and unwant- «
ed in residence halls for the purpose
of search is but another in an ever-
growing list of student grievances
against the college’s “in loco parentis” '
policies.

It is indeed unfortunate that the
administration still finds it necessary
to attempt to control the lives of the
students under some moralistic code
while hypocritically operating under
the Code of Responsibility.

Whai is €ven more unfortunate—is
that itS policies and police actions
are alienating the administraiion more
and’ more fr6m the students that it
desperately needs to be relatin® to at
this time. Already rumors as
those concerning paid, student infor
mers are spreading rapidly through
ihe student body, and. students are
naturally reacting negatively toward
the college.

fven the student ‘silent majority”
is beginning to complain about the’
college’s apparent disregard of stu-
dent rights, a disregard stemming
from an attempt to keep Davidson
in its traditional role and‘ the David-
sonstudent in his traditional place.

~The crux ‘of the problem seems to

» the “in, loco parentis’’, policies:
he-attitude of the administration that
Davidson students still need to be
regulated, managed, ‘‘mothered,”
even though the college last year
agreed to the student freedoms pro-
vided by the Code of Responsibility.
It is this attitude that the students
can’t accept and that Burney is at-
tacking. io

Because of the student®sentjment
developing along these lines,-we agree

such

Burney
has set forth in his letter. It is not
the place of the college to give unex-
pected ‘‘room checks” for whatever

. Teason, nor is it under the’ present

_ expec’
the worth of the Code: when the ad-’

Code of Responsibility the adminis
tration’s duty to administer general
dormitory regulations.

The Code of Responsibility can only
be as good as all elements of David
son allow it to be. Therefore, if -is
necessary that fhe administration a
cept the Code in practice as well as
nominally if it is to operate effective
ly. Otherwise, the student freedoms
which are new to’ Davidson. will
soon be lost.

If the administration does

However, if the administratien in
reality doesn’t care if the (rts slic

well.

When the Code was set up, it was
agreed that it would come up for the
review of the Board of Trusteés. So
on April 24 the trustees will judge
the Code according to its general
acceptance and™~success among the
student body and over the rest of the
campus.

How, then, can the administration

ministration itself is taking the stu-
dents’ initiative? Is the Code doomed
‘to failure simply because certain col-
lege policies and policy-makers re-
fused to take the plunge and try it
out completely? ¢

(We hope not. After all, it’s still
not too late for the administration .to
put the Code into practice.

Court On Trial

After much discussion and com-
plaining from Davidson students, mis
understanding on the part of the col-
lege community and a great deal of
secrecy on the part of the powers
that be, the Davidson judicial system
has considered its process to thé ex-
tent that it has reversed a sentence.

The decision in question was the
one convicting a student of violating
the Code of Responsibility by selling
halluncinatory drugs.

When students first learned of: the
proceedings in this case it was readi-
ly apparent that many were displeas-
ed with the actions of the Regulations
Court in handing down the decision
that it did :

From the

transcripts of the cour

proceedings it was obvious that this
part of the college judiciary did not
operate as many students assumed a

court would act which held
sway over their college careers

Several.students questioned points
peculiar to this one case, bui many
also pointed to broad characteristics
of court operation that they felt were
in conflict with good judicial prac-
tice. And those general objections are
significant.

It is also significant that the de-
fendant involved specifically request-
ed that his retrial should not be con-_
ducted by the Regulations Court. He
-claimed-that-the-court-could-not-give
him a fair trial. And we agree with
him.

In_ fact, leaving the details of this
particular case aside, it is hard to

Nice To Know

Let us not deny that apathy is one
of the chief characteristics of the Da-
vidson student body. =

It is also unfortunate that much of
what passes for activity in the face
of apathy is time spent flying in the
library or elsewhere.

For those reasons it is extremely

such

refreshing to find an attitude such
as.that which has been demonstrated
by the freshmen on second floor Can-

non. Extremely refreshing.

These freshmen, led by Mike Scott,

showed that they were willing to sac-
rifice not only some of their time but
also their money to help one of those
very real but-too often ignored citi-
zens of the “other Davidson.”
. Most important is the fact that
Scott initiated the action and the stu-
dents on his halt participated com-
pletely voluntarily.

This action was not one of those
semi-coerced but highly publicized
acts of good-will that many of the
more -reactionary pledge classes are
‘so fond of doing. - five .

of individual students.

It is something we find very en-
couraging. It is an act»we would like
to see emulated. 2

- ity. is that stu

imagine how the court as it is present-
ly set up could give very many fair
trails at all, original or retrial.

The problem is in court structure
which does not allow the proper sepa-
ration of court interests and the -in-
terests of the defendant.

First there is the problem of the
chairman of the court working be
fore the court is ever brought to ses
sion to try to gather evidence and deé-
cide whether a trial is indeed justi-
fied. By the time the court has ruled
that a necessity for trial-exists, there
is already significant doubt. in’ the
minds of its members as to the in-
nocence of the defendant.

A second problem arises once the
court has begun its, hearings. The
court is forced to act’as its own pro-
secutor. Not only has the court been
biased by its own preliminary proceéd-
ings but also it is forced to adopt a
negative attitude toward the defend
ent in order to bring out supposedly
incriminating evidence. The court is
forced by its very structure to dwell
most intensely from its own point of
view on the negative aspect of the
case.

There aré two dangers in this al-
most inherent negative bias on the
part of court members.

First there—is—the—problem that
this bias will go unnoticed. Court
members could assume that they were
offering the fairest possible trial and
could easily hand down a conviction.
This conviction: might be proper but
there-is-the-too-real-danger~that-it
cone be harsher than the facts justi-

ied.

On the other hand the question of
negative. bias might ‘be entirely un-
justified. The court, evolved out of
the manifest wisdom of the Code of
Responsibility, may be well aware
of the problems inherent in its struc-
ture. ‘In fact it may be too aware of
these weaknesses.

A court wary of its own power and
opinion might -easily be too-weak to
consider properly casts @oing be-
fore it. Such a court might. be too
passive to seek the proper evidence
and all theevidence. It might be too
cautious to reach a valid decision.

The solution to these problems
seems to lie in the area of two new
divisions of power. The first would
be the establishment of a grand jury
system to decide if a trial is really
necessary. Such a system coutd help
free a court of preliminary bias.

A second change could be the cre-
ation of a prosecutor for the. court.
Not only would the court be freed
of some possibilities for prejudice but
the prosecutor would save the court
much work by -bringing ‘all the - per-
tinent evidence for his case without
the court having to dig-it up. .

As it stands now the court is. not
at a, peak of popularity. And a-great
part.of the reason for lack of popular-

and apparently suffering from a gross

misalignment of power. Perhaps with

a few changes in the court student
distrust would disappear.

More than 350 colleges and
universities are planning to
participate in a ‘national
campaign of environmental
education” this spring, ac-
cording to a spokesman for
Environmental Teach - In,
Inc. which is a. group of
graduate and_ professional
students who are co-ordinat-
ing the campaign. I

Most of the activities will
culminate in a national
teach-in on environmental
problems. which is planned
for April 22. Sen. Gaylord
Nelson (D-Wis.) first
posed the teach-in last Sep-
tember.

“Graduation with honors or

“The schools can use the
method that will give the

explained Larry Rowe,

ior majoring in political
science.

“This will work to the stu-

SEMEL SE LA ALLO MLE TEE TAS
And The Changes They Are A-timing

Guess"who said, “‘we want change to come from
within rather than from outside pressure. t

State legislators, local school boards, the presi-
dent of Davidson College, Davidson’s new °C presi-
dent Johnny Bruner, and countless others have voiced
assorted versionsf this pitiful plea successfully arous-
ing sympathetic reactions, but WY? yay ;

What potent emotion-activators lie hidden in the
concept of change “coming from within rather than
without?” ; : ;

I suggest that the various forms of this phrase
tempt one to yield to the animal urge to do what one
pleases, blindly ignoring good reasons not to.

In the’ legislative and school board examples,
the appeal to “let us initiate action rather than be
pressured from without” would often be more fairly
represented as “let us get used to nigras at our own
speed.”

But what did Dr. Spencer
mean ‘when they used similar
something different. foe

Spencer was characterizing the trends indicated
by the Trustee's actions at"their recent meeting when

he question is whether we are going ‘to
change constructively or let college be
hanged by ouiside forces.”

But look at the trustees’ actions: They said they
liked a campus expansion scheme, especially the li-
brarygsite. They said they liked the idea of girl stu-
dents (who doesn’t?) but didn’t have the money for
it (who does?)}, They said they wanted more minoriiy
representation, ie, blacks. And finally they said
football could sink or swim on alumni support.

All that makes great copy for the College News
3ureau and even impresses a few students. But think
about it. These sweeping changes may not take place
for years. ;

Long range planning is essential to the welfare
of the College, to be sure, but why did the trustees
take no action on some of the specific problems which
can be dealt with now?-

Perhaps the trustees could be expected to delay
debate on the makeup of the board itself, but why
was action not taken on other recommendations of
tHe Spencer Commission on Church Relations?

Why was not the proposal to drop the “‘God-rule”
faculty restrictions debated and acted on by the trus-
tees? The College is currently recruiting faculty pros-
pects for next year and surely would have been aided
by dropping this archaic restriction on academic free-
dom

and Johnny Bruner
phrases? Obviously,

1
ne

Why was not the same commission’s proposal to
drop certain intimidating religious-questions from Da-
vidson’s application forms debated? The commission
suggested that these questions alienate potential ap-
plicants; it Seems obvious that an all-male institution
can no longer afford to needlessly alienate capable
applicants.

Examples. from other commission reports are
too numerous to list here, but the technique should
be clear. Gloss changes with the right amount of
rhetoric, stay away from sensitive’ areas, and delay
the effects of your actions; then everybody’s happy.

Finally, what did Bruner mean when he said: he
wants the IFC to initiate action rather than react to
outside pressure? Did he mean that the IFC will ad-
minister next year's anti-rush? (So much for humor.

_ Or does he hope to challenge the College and the stu

dent body to fullfill their responsibility to offer all
the students a modicum of “social life?”

What all this means, I think, is that Spencer and
Bruner (and Coble and Burney, for that matter) can
take advantage of their various authorities and inttiate
the changes needed for the College’s welfare or thes
can delay such change until further delay would
be economically or otherwise disastorous ;

At any ratéMet us not confuse their rhejoric with
their actions. ‘

‘Roshomon’ Recounts Trial:
Moral Question Not Solved

is built around recollections
of a trial based on an an-

Ryunosuke Akutagawa, a
story of murder and seduc-
tion involving a bandit, a
merchant, and the mer-
chant's wife.

complicated by four differ-
