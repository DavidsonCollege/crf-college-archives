CHARLOTTE HIGH SCHOOL
DEFEATS SCRUBS AGAIN

Last Saturday on Wearn field the
Charlotte Highs defeated the Davidson
scrub team by a score of 14 to 12. The
Scrubs were somewhat heavier than the
High School, but this was made up for
by the speed of the Charlotte backs, who
repeatedly ripped off long gains round
the ends. The Scrubs, however, were
impregnable in the line and gained con-
sistently thru the line of their opponents.

The two touchdowns for the David-
son scrubs were made by straight, hard
football, line plays together with short
end runs and one forward pass, out of
about a half dozen attempted with threc
intercepted by the local backfielders.

The two touchdowns for the Highs
were results of lone runs by Captain
Templeton and McDonald. Each one
of them was for 85 yards. McDonald
made his from scrimmage and Wearn
kicked goal, putting the Highs in the
lead by one point. Play was resumed
and Davidson fought hard and_ scored
another touchdown, Captain ‘Cemple
ton requested a kick-off when his team
was last scored on and put behind. When
the kick-off took place Captain ‘Temple-
ton caught the ball and_ side-stepped,
one opponent after another and finally
placed the ball behind the goal posts. As
usual both teams scored an equal num-
her of touchdowns. In this game they
scored two each for 12 points for each
team. ‘The difference in the score was
brought about by the reliable toe of Bill
Wearn, who put both his trials for goals
after touchdowns scored squarely thru
the uprights for one point on each kick,
making the total score for the after-
noon’s victors (4 points.

Offensive stars for the Highs were
Captain ‘Templeton, McDonald and
Nesbit. R. Wearn, Linney and Tem
pleton were the defensive stars for the
Highs. Captain Robson, at quarterback,
and Massey, at fullback, were the stars
for the Davidsonians.

the purpose in the beginning. It was
published for this one time merely as an
experiment with the idea of a future col-
lege newspaper.

This paper is part of Davidson his-
tory. It stands at the beginning of rep-
resentative journalism at Davidson. It
is 2 monument to the class, of which it
should be proud. Indeed it is a credit
and is an invaluable increment to the
collections which we prize and hold dear
and sacred to our collegiate history.
