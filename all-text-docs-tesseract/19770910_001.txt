Zimmerman speaks on newposition

By CATHERINE LANDIS

Dr. Price Zimmerman ar-
rived in Davidson July 5 to
begin work as Vice Presi-
dent of Academic Affairs.

With him he brought educa-
tional experience at Williams,
Oxford, Harvard, and the Univ-
ersity of Florence, thirteen
years of teaching experience,
an expertise in expeditionary
climbing and photography,
and 100 cases of books.

He also came with a unique
eloquence which enables his t
eloquence which enables him
to speak at times like a scho-
lar, at times like a poet.

With characteristic calm he
spoke with The Davidsonian
on his new job, on Davidson,
on himself.

One ot the immediate prob-
lems on his mind is the
development of a standardized
hiring procedure for new facul-
ty..He comments, ‘What we
want is a set of procedures by
which the needs of the college
commitment will be translated
into, procedures of hiring.’

‘‘The end,’’ he continues,
‘‘is the impact the faculty
member will have on the
college. Any teacher must be

judged by both students and
faculty. The most important
aspect is teaching effective-
ness. Whether he is stimulat-
ing and exciting must be
determined by students. What
he teaches must be evaluated
by faculty colleagues.’’

““A good procedure calls for
the combination judgement of
students and faculty.’’

Zimmermanholds a similar
philosophy on the evaluation
of faculty after they have been
hired. ‘‘Faculty evaluation,”
he says, ‘‘calls for some proce-
dure which is judged by
averyone to be fair to all’?

He commented on SGA
President Thom Young’s
concept of a_ dualistic
tvpe of evaluation, where-by a’

course evaluation would be
separated from the evaluation
of professor, competence
which would remain confiden-
tial.

“It sounds like a good
system. The course evaluation
would give a point of view
about the college which would
be helpful for those selecting
courses. At this point it looks
as if such a guide would have
to be student run.”

He added, ‘‘This system
still doesn't solve the problem
of student input on the confi-
dential faculty evaluation.”’

Zimmerman suggested a
third evaluation form be con-
structed which would be given
back to the professors to help
them in designing their

subcommittee to evaluate
Patterson Court regulations

‘By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

A subcommittee of the
Cowncil on Campus and Reli-
wgaous: Life will soon begin its
review of the regulations
whichaguide the operation of
Patterson Court.

Chemistry professor Felix
A. Carroll, chairman of the
Rules Subcommitte, recog-
nizes that most at Davidson
are interested in the future of
the social system on Patterson
Court and knows that many
4 have strong opinions about
)the nt rules under which
the Court operates.

Interested in working for
The Davidsonian?

Positions are open in all
areas of the newspaper--we
need writers, photographers,
typists, proofreaders,
business and administrative
assistants, etc.

No previous newspaper ex-
perience is required to work
with The Davidsonian. If you
want to get involved and are
willing to devote some time to
the newspaper (you determine
how much), come to our
meeting Monday, September
12 at 7 pm in the Conference
{Room on the second floor of
the Union.

He promises that the Rules
Subcommittee will approach
their work in a ‘‘logical, meth-
odical’’ fashion, gathering
facts and information from all
sides before reaching any con-
clusions.

Issues involving Patterson
Court’s rules stirred campus-
wide controversy on several
occasions last school year.

In one instance, a group of
female students and a coed
group of freshmen competed
for the right to establish an
eating club in the then-vacant
Rusk House for this schdol
year.

The Council on Campus and
Religious Life conducted hear-
ings and eventually gave Rusk
House to the women’s group,
but also recommended that
specific guidelines for estab-
lishing a house should be
included in the Court’s regula-
tions to handle similar situa-
tions in the future.

Later in the year Greg
Anders '77, a member of one of
the on-campus national frater-
nities, submitted a proposal
that would allow the on-cam-
pus nationals to operate a tra-
ditional rush, bid, and pledge
system basically independent
from the eating clubs’ self-sel-
ection system.

The Anders’ proposal drew
a flurry of reaction -—7roveizal

students submitted compet-

ing proposals. The Patterson
Court Council (which contains
two members from each house
on the Court) approved the
Anders proposal in a contro-
versial vote derided by some
PCC members as unrepresen-
tative of the opinion of all the
students eating on the Court.

Under current Court rules, a
freshman is allowed to self-sel-

ect into any house on thej

Court. The.rules, however, are

a step from reality, because ]
women seldom self-select into 4
the national fraternities, and 4
no men have signed to eat at }

courses. He says, ‘‘As a
teacher I was always interest-
ed in what was interesting to
the class.”’

About all forms of evalua-
tion Zimmerman commented
“What is important to deter-
mine is if the professor is
successful, excited, and pre-
pared. Teaching requires im-
agination; to imagine what it
is like to be approached by the
material for the first time.”

On the tonic of Extended
Studies, Zimmerman hopes
Tne faculty and EPC will
@arify the situation soon.

His feelings on Extended
Studies, as he puts it, ‘‘are in
the middle.’’ ‘‘I think at a
college like Davidson there
ought to be an opportunity for
individual work. I've given
extended studies and it’s fun.
That’s what it should be. It is
a joint venture where the
professor and student make a
commitment to each other.”’

‘‘On the other side,’’ he
continues, ‘‘I do not think a
course is necessary for any-
thing and everything. Basical-
ly what the college should do
is provide a systematic way
which will enable a student to
study on his own later.’’

As to his feeling about how
Extended Studies should be
run he says, ‘‘I think it was
poor to require them. I think
there should be an element of
flexibility.”’

“‘From my standpoint at
this particular moment what I
am concerned with is faculty
time. You could be teaching 20
students in the hour that you
teach one. The pressures on
the faculty members are al-
ready great.”

He turned from. campus

Rusk House. Another issue is
that some houses “‘encourage”’ 4

or ‘‘discourage’’ potential |
members to a greater degree #

than other houses.

After an organizational

meeting next week, the Sub-

committee will schedule an —
open meeting to give inter- 7
ested students an opportunity
to express their views. Then #
the subcommittee will divide ”
into small work groups to/

study three specific areas.
Those areas are:

1) Writing rules for establi-j

affairs to Zimmerman the
man. Not only is he a teacher,
scholar, and administrator, he
is an expert expeditionary
climber.

'“4he first climb is-an inter-
ebfing- experience On ‘a’ slope
of 40 degrees with a.slope of
a thousand feet of space below
your feet, you wonder what’s
in this for me.

‘‘Some people come down
wad decide they’re not going
‘gack. The others...well, it
ows on you; you get hooked.
‘gs tiring, but you can’t wait:
ct the next climb.”

Speaking like a poet he

continues, illustrating his
words with handiwork from
another hobby, photography.

“Climbing gives rewards no
other sport has in terms of
scenery, the beauty of the
light and sunshine on a gla-
cier, endless space, standing
on a rock and having the
clouds roll in below you,
seeing a sunset above those
clouds.”’

He added, smiling, ““There’s:
a lot of suffering too, so it
appeals to your masochism.”

“Then there’s the compan-
ionship. You learn to work on
a team where your life is
dependent upon the relation-
ship with and skill of your
teammates.

Zimmerman’s academic
specialty is Renaissance His-
tory. He is now doing research
on the 16th-century historian
Paclo Giovio. He visits
Florence frequently ‘‘because
the libraries and archives there
are just what I need.”’
