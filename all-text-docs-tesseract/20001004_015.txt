After’ seven straight home games, the
Davidson College women’s soccer team took
their two-game conference winning streak
on the road, traveling to the College, of
Charleston and
Georgia South-
ern University
over the week-
end. The Cats,
who began the
weekend with a
record of 2-0 in

the Southern Conference (8-2 overall), picked
' up one win and one loss on their trip south.

On Friday, the women defeated the Charles-

ton Cougars (1-7, 0-1 SoCon) 2-1. On Sun-

day however, the Wildcats were handed their
first conference loss by Georgia Southern,
falling 3-2 in regulation.

In Friday’s game, the Wildcats. took the
lead early from a penalty kick taken by Leigh
Anne Hoskins ‘04 in the 12" minute, The
Davidson offense continued to press hard
throughout the first half hoping to net another
goal, while the Cougars made numerous at-
tempts to get the equalizer (outshooting the

- Cats 5-4). Neither team could penetrate the
opposing defense to net a goal, keeping the

score 1-0 going into the locker rooms at the
half.

The second half was dominated by the Cats
who held the Cougars to only five shots.
Unfortunately, one of those shots made it into
the back of the net halfway through the sec-
ond half. With just over 30 minutes remain-
ing, College of Charleston forward Alison
Davies slipped the ball past Corrigan to tie the
game at one all. Yet eight minutes later,
Hoskins saw an opportunity for the Cats to get
back on top off a feed from Heather Maloney
‘03. With a good touch, Hoskins used her
finesse to once again lay the ball in past
Charleston goalkeeper Kelly Sweetingham.

The Cats managed to hold on to capture the
2-1 win over the Cougars and improve to 3-0
in the Southern Conference as they traveled
to. Georgia Southern on Sunday.

Unlike the College of Charleston, the Eagles.

of Georgia Southern appeared to be underes-
timated by many in the Southern Conference.
Not only did the Eagles (10-2, 2-1) snap their
two game losing skid in their 3-2 victory on
Sunday, but they also ended the Cats three
game conference winning streak.

The Wildcats were put in a deep hole early
when they allowed two unanswered goals in
the first six minutes of the game. In a quick
push up the field, Georgia Southern’s Janis
Milne, off an assist from Robin Thirsk, ripped

a shot from 35 sas out that zoomed out of

senior goalkeeper Winnie Corrigan’s reach
and into the back of the goal. Two minutes
later, an aggressive Davidson defense got the
best of themselves when a bad tackle turned

. into a Georgia Southern advantage. Robin

YL ae Lh just six min-
utes into the
game.

Georgia Southern maintained their com-
fortable lead throughout the’ first half, enter-
taining only two shots by the Wildcat of-
fense. This is atypical play from a Davidson
squad which is averaging around nine shots
per half this season. Overall, the first half
belonged to the Eagles, who seemed more
than prepared to garner the glory of ending
the Cats conference win streak.

Yet the second half belonged to the Cats
and the tenacious offensive play of Heather
Maloney. Eight minutes into the half,
Maloney was sideswiped in: the box and
promptly awarded the penalty kick. Maloney
easily placed the ball past Georgia Southern
goalkeeper Kari Gast to get the Cats on the
board. The Wildcats continued to pressure

‘the Eagle defense taking 12 shots on

forcing Gast to make seven big saves to hold —
off the equalizer.

But just when the Cats were feeling the
momentum of the game starting to swing
their way, a Georgia Southern freshman took
it.away from them. Just minutes after
Maloney’s PK, Georgia Southern forward
Genevieve Ward tapped in the game winner
off a corner kick by teammate Amanda Ber-
nard. The Cats did not appear ready to
concede though because they continued to
look for goals. Finally, Heather Maloney got
free of the Eagle defense with 4:31 remaining
in the game to bring the Wildcats to. within
one of the tie.

The Cats scrambled until the final seconds
where Mary Ellen Schaefer and Leigh Anne ..
Hoskins both had opportunities to score.
Mary Ellen Schaefer ‘03 took a shot that
deflected off a Georgia Southern defender
and ended up at Hoskinsi feet. Hoskins who
with less than 5 seconds left took the final
shot of the game which hit just off the top of
the crossbar. And leaving the final score 3-
2 Georgia Southern.

The Cats finish their road series this week-
end over Fall Break where they travel to
Cambridge, MA to face Vermont and
Harvard.

Volleyball picks up big non-conference win over Wake

By MIKE ANDERSON
Editor Emeritus

After Davidson’s men’s hoops squad
stunned Wake Forest on the floor of Belk
Arena last spring, head coach Bob McKillop
told reporters, “This was kind of like getting
your lunch money back from the bully.”

The Wildcat volleyball program got a
taste of that same sweet revenge last Saturday
night, earning their first-ever win over an
ACC opponent with a five-game victory over
the Wake’s
Demon Dea-
cons.

“This
was our big-
gest win of the
season so far,”
, said an elated
head coach Tami Darwin. “It was far and
away the best we’ ve played this year.”

Davidson pounced to a quick 14-8 lead
in the first game and then weathered a Wake
rally before hanging on to earn a 17-15 game
one victory. The teams went on to split the
first four games, but it was all Davidson in
game five to win three games to two.

“Our girls played a great fifth game,”

said Darwin. “So many different people
stepped up at crucial points and made big
plays.”

Senior Mara
Mordini put the
exclamation point
on the win, pound-
ing away an em-
phatic kill for the
match’s final
point. Mordini’s
19-kill/28-dig ef-
fort earned her a
second-consecu-
tive Southern
Conference
Player of the
Week award.

Women’s
basketball coach
John Filar, who’
has also coached
competitive vol-
leyball and. con-
tinues to follow
the sport at the col-
lege level, mar-
veled at Mordini’s
effort. “Mara Mordini “could play for any

team in the ACC,” he said. “No doubt.”

Another key pair of contributors on the
evening were jun-
ior Jennifer
Ortegaand sopho-
more Rebecca
Teichgraeber,
whotallied 16 and
11 kills, respec-
tively.

Wake
Forest’s head
coach Valorie
Baker predicted
that the Davidson
match would be
“an excellent op-
portunity” for her
team to earn an
easy non-confer-
ence win. “Player
for player, I think
we have a stron-
ger lineup,” she
swanked. |

But
Davidson was
more than up for
‘the challenge. “We’ ve had our sights set.on

Wake for a long time,” said Darwin.. “We
knew that beating them would be a big con-
fidence-booster for us.”

The victory was Davidson’s third- '
straight five-game win, but it came on the
heels of a string of less-than-stellar confer-
ence performances. Earlier last week, David-'
son had been pushed to five games by two of
the conference’s weaker teams, Georgia
Southern and UNC Greensboro.

“Wake was a big win for us,” said senior
co-captain Lauren Schultz. “And it came at w
areally good time. A win like this proves a
lot to us.”

Darwin agreed. “This game is a huge
building block for us. We can take this back
to the conference knowing that weive beaten
a strong ACC team.”

The win improved Davidson to 10-6
overall. Their 6-1 record in Southern Confer-
ence action puts them back at the top of
Southern Conference, where they are tied
with ETSU for first-place.

The Wildcats face perhaps their most :
important weekend of Southern Conference %
action thus far, hosting both Appalachian
State (who defeated another ACC power-
house, Clemson, earlier ius senso) aud
ETSU.
