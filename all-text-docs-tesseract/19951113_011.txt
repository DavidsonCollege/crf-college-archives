Other People just other people

By Mary Tow _es ALLISON
Staff Writer

What exactly is there to say
about a band named Other People,
anyway? If they’re just other
people, what good are they? Who
are the people? Guess I was just in
the mood to think irrelevant
thoughts Monday night. Really
though, things sounded a little
sketchy. Upon my arrival to the
concert, my friend pointed out that
two-thirds of the band members
had dreads — quite a diversion
from the other bands we’ve seen.
Bound by our stereotypical soci-
ety, we were expecting a reggae
sound, This face-value judgement
was almost right. Other People
had a mixture of mellow reggae
and rock; I also heard jazz influ-
ences in their music.

I wasn’t completely inspired
by the band, but they really knew
their stuff. The songs were a bit
too long for my taste, and they all
sounded a lot alike so it was hard to
tell if five songs had been played or
if the first song just hadn’t ended
yet. I also couldn’t hear all the
vocals.

Onthe positive side, the sound
was extremely relaxing and had a
great beat that drew the listener in.
The group members were friendly
and seemed excited about playing,
regardless of the fact that there was
only a small handful of people
there, They were having a great
time and were really into their
music. A lot of their songs had
long instrumental interludes,

which, while pleasing to the ear
and a real exhibition of their tal-
ents, got repetitive and took me to
the brink of wondering when and if
they were ever going to sing again.
If Other People is trying to achieve
arelaxing sound good for late night
study breaks and quaint coffee
shops, they’ve reached their goal.
However, it would be in their best
interests to give their music some
diversity. I was impressed, but the
concert didn’t leave me with an
emotional high.

The people I talked with had
similar feelings. One girl agreed
that the music was a little repeti-

tive but said, ““They’re just so good,
though. It’s hard to write songs
that all sound different. They’re
very talented.” These Other People
were definitely worth hearing, but
a whole concert is a little much. A
whole CD would be a little much,
too, mainly because of the similar-
ity of the songs.

The singers were great and it
was obvious that all the band mem-
bers were gifted musicians. They
would be entertaining if coupled
with another band that had a very
different sound, but hearing them

alone left me wishing there was —

some other group.
