While most Davidson stu-
dents returned to class Monday
morning after Spring Break, sev-
eral students were stuck in their
vacation spot after buying into
low-cost travel programs for the
week.

A group of Davidson stu-
dents experienced problems with
their “all-inclusive” tripto Cancun
through a discount travel com-
pany.

The day before their depar-
ture, Dave Christopherson and
eight others were told that their
package was no longer all-inclu-
sive and that they could neither
cancel nor receive refunds for the
trip.

“We've written a iot of let-
ters and made a lot of phone calls,
and we’re prepared to sue,” says
Christopherson.

Senior Rob Kosicki and four
friends ventured to the Bahamas
with Take a Break Student Travel,
the company they used last year
without problems, but this past

week had difficulities leaving.

discount travel programs

“Our flight was supposed to
leave at 1 p.m. Sunday but was
delayed. At 7 p.m. that night the
plane finally came in, but when the
plane pulled in the flight atten-
dants hopped off and caughtacom-
mercial flight home,” says Kosicki.

The group was forced to stay
in the airport that night waiting for
a new flight crew to arrive, who
skipped town as well. upon their
arrival in Nassau.

Many students felt compelled
to purchase tickets on more repu-
table airlines to ensure their depar-
ture, since the program chartered
their own flights.

“Take a Break seems to be a
fly by the night travel agency that
is in the business to make a quick
buck. It’s unfortunate that we got
caught in the middle of it,” says
Aubrey Proud. “They were very
unprofessional, and when we
needed their help in finding some
answers they were nowhere to be
found.”

Take a Break refused to com-
ment and hung up the phone when
The Davidsonian called to inquire
about the problems students had.

Shondell Laclair of Village

Travel coordinated the programs
for the students. “I was very
surprised [with the problems stu-
dents had]. I feel really bad for;
the students. We’ve used these
companies for the past few years,
but I advised them that the pro-
grams were cheap packages and
not to expect much.”

Kristen Richardson, who was
a part of another group traveling
to Nassau, says, “Not only. did
Ms. Laclair neglect to tell us about
previous problems, but she also
assured us. that the travel insur-
ance offered by the company was
unneccesary.”

Village Travel only works
with the companies over spring
break but plans to discontinue
use in the future.

“Tt’s just too much of a head-
ache,” says Laclair.

“Be wary of all these pack-
ages,” Christopherson says, “it
seems like there are a lot of scams
out there.”

If anyone falls prey to the
clutches of discount programs
gone bad, Christopherson advises
students to “raise hell and threaten
to sue.”

Women’s
Study

from page 1

have been seen in recent years.

Since 1990-91, the percentage of —

tenured female faculty has nearly
doubled, rising from 10% of total
tenured faculty in 1990-91 to
19.6 % in 1995-96,

eWomen In Athletics: In

1991-92, 32 % of Davidson ath-

letes were women; yet only 15% of
that year’s total recruiting budget
was allocated to women’s athlet-
ics. However, strides have been
taken to balance such dispropor-
tionate athletic budget allocations,
as evidenced in the spending of
athletic scholarships in 1994-95.
In that year, 51% of all athletic
scholarships were awarded to male
athletes while 49% went to female
athletes.

¢ Women In Administrative
and Leadership Roles: As stated
in the Self-Study document, while
“female representation at different
administrative and academic lev-
els has slowly increased since
1985...Women students at

Davidson are still seriously con-
cerned with the lack of female role
models in positions of authority.”

Since 1985, women have held
positions as Associate Dean of Stu-
dents, Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid, as well as the posi-
tion of co-editor of the Davidsonian
and Union Board President.

¢ Courses On Gender Rela-
tions and Women’s Issues: Over
20 courses are offered concerning
women and gender relations.
Courses such as Women In Ameri-
can History, Women Writers, and
Feminist Thought, Sex, Technol-
ogy, and Morality as well as the
Concentration in Gender Studies
are evidence of the study of women
and gender across the curriculum.

¢ Women’s Health Services:
A number of female counselors,
health educators, and physician
assistants are available to students
through Student Health Services
and the Counselling Center. In
addition, “the Counselling Center
has expanded its scope,” and now
deals with such issues as eating
disorders, sexual harassment, and
acquaintance rape.

Despite these options, the
Study states its findings that

“women students would like to
have additional counselors and
health educators, as well as more
educational programs concerning
such topics as human sexuality,
AIDS, acquaintance rape, sexual
harassment, eating disorders,
stress, and alcohol abuse.”

¢ Women’s Safety Concerns:

The study found that “Confi-
dential reports to counselors and
female faculty” suggest that cases
of acquaintance rape are
underreported. In addition, “sexual
assault and battery are serious is-
sues of concern for Davidson Col-
lege.” The Study recognized that
these issues are of great concern
for many American universities
and colleges at this time.

¢ Sexual Harassment: While
45% of women believe that sexual
harassment is present at Patterson
Court, only 15% of fraternity mem-
bers agreed. Women students,”
states the Study, “are not convinced
that Davidson College takes seri-
ously allegations of sexual harass-
ment.” However, in an effort to
reduce the problem of harassment,
the Code of Responsibility has been
revised to address sexual harass-
ment.
