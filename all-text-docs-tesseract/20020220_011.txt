Despite gusty 10 mph winds and a frigid
temperature in the low 50s, the Davidson
College men’s tennis team prevailed over the
University of North Carolina-Asheville Bull-
dogs with a dramatic 4-3 victory.

In an unusual outdoor February match played
at the Covington Tennis Courts, the Wildcats
found themselves battling the unfavorable con-
ditions and their opponents before emerging
with an exciting win that came down to the last
match.

Using the weather to their advantage, the
mountain-based Bulldogs came out firing
early, easily earning the doubles point with
wins in all three doubles matches.

After being down 6-3, number one doubles
combo Rob Haywood ’04 and Donald Miles
’05 brought the match to a tie-breaker, before
losing 9-8 (7-2).

At number two doubles, Chad Winebarger
*02 and Rob Gould ’04 led their match early,
but fell 8-6.

David Webb ’02 and Jonathan Britt ’04
were defeated 8-3 at the number three doubles
position.

Despite the frustrating start, the Wildcats

regrouped and captured four of the six singles
matches. Winebarger earned the ’Cats’ first
point of the match with a quick 6-2, 6-0 victory
at number one singles. In spite of a formidable
effort, Webb was unable to win at number two
singles, losing in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.

At number three singles, Haywood cap-
tured the first set before dropping the second
and third sets in a 6-2, 5-7, 6-3 loss.

For the Wildcats’ second and third points,
Britt dropped the first set at number four
singles before storming back for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-

4 victory, and, at number five, Miles won in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.

With the match tied at three points each,
Geoff Mullen ’03 stepped into the spotlight
and emerged as the hero of the match with a
thrilling three-set victory at number six
singles.

Plagued by inconsistency in the first set,
Mullen elevated the level of his game, easily
winning the second and third sets, 3-6, 6-3,
6-1. Mullen’s impressive victory captured
the final point of the match, handing the
Cats a 4-3 victory.

Following the match, head coach Jeff
Frank said, “It was one of those character
building matches. I’m really proud of the
kids for hanging tough in unfavorable con-
ditions.”

Earlier in the match, Frank noted that the
team needed to learn to play outside, since
their spring break trip consists entirely of
outdoor matches.

Due to cold winter temperatures, the team
does not usually play an outdoor match until
late February. Nonetheless, the Wildcats
were able to play through the conditions and
defeat the Bulldogs, which made this vic-
tory all the more important for the team’s
development.

With Sunday’s impressive win against
UNC-Asheville, Davidson improves its sea-
son record to 4-2. The Wildcats have a week
and a half off to practice and prepare before
opening up Southern Conference play dur-
ing their spring break trip, which begins on
March 1 against College of Charleston.

During their trip, the Cats will also face
conference rivals the Citadel, Georgia South-
ern University, University of Tennessee-
Chattanooga, and Colonial Athletic Confer-
ence foe James Madison University.
