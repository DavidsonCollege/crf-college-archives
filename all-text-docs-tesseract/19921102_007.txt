A Protest Against Apathy

(We Knew You Wouldn't Read Another Spike Editorial or anything else)

The point we are attempting to make here is that if you have a concer or
criticism, this is one of your major forums to express it. The Davidsonian is an
outlet paid for by you and run by your peers for your use and enjoyment. A few
weeks ago we asked for your opinions on the upcoming visit of Spike Lee. We
solicited in the editorial and with flyers throughout campus for your thoughts.
The response was pitiful. Perhaps we are missing the things you want to see in
your campus newspaper. If so,we can't fix it without your input. So let us hear
what you want to see init. Help us help you address your concems or highlight
your accomplishments. Give us a call or drop us a line, we'd love to hear from
you.

Reilly Attacks Community Apathy

| To the Editor,

I’m writing in regard to
the disappointing turnout by
students and faculty alike at
the October 15 forum fea-

_ | turing two U.S. Representa-

tive candidates from ourarea.
Both Rory Blake , candidate
from North Carolina’s 9th
district and Melvin Watt of
the 12th district attended the
affair, but sadly found only
15 students, one administra-
tor, and no faculty members
in the auditorium.

My first reaction was to
attack the student body and
the faculty for their apparent
apathy. Thus, as I apolo-
gized to the candidates, I
couldn’t help but take a shot
at both groups: However, I
thought it only fair that I
should attempt to understand
why so few people evidenced
any interest Thursday night.

Clearly, the main rea-

son that students gave me
for failing to attend the fo-
rum was that they needed to
study for their mid-term ex-
ams. As a Davidson stu-
dent, I too know the diffi-
culty of thecurriculum. Yet,
many students who were
there said they needed to
study. These over-burdened
students had their priorities
inthe rightorder. My father,
a high school teacher, often
said to his students, “Never
let school get in the way of
your education.” This inci-
dent exemplifies exactly
what he meant.

By nomeans should the
faculty escape my com-
ments. We put a notice in
every faculty ‘mailbox in
Chambers and virtually cov-
ered the halls with signs; we
did not fear redundancy.
And I’m reluctant to accept
the argument that professors

were also distracted by mid-
terms. Professors are busi-
est after mid-terms — while
correcting papers — not dur-
ing the exam period. So
what’s really going on here?
Should I be assuming
that people failed to attend
as aresult of conflicting pri-
orities? Or were they sim-
ply uninterested? _ Maybe
apathy is even devouring
places where political activ-
ity was once an explicit goal:
the college campus. If this is
the case, I challenge each of
you to decide whether apa-
thy benefits both your per-
sonal intellectual develop-
ment and the society as a
whole. Andif you, too, view

“apathy as detrimental, T urge

you to help diminish its
spread on campus or in the
community.

Sincerely,

Mark Reilly ‘95

Students Defend Gullan's Character

To the Editor,

In the last issue of The
Davidsonian, a letter ap-
peared expressing disap-
proval of Bill Gullan’s re-
marks at the Young Demo-
crats vs. Young Republicans
debate. Bill’scomments and
jokes were made only toridi-
cule the alleged promiscuity
of Democratic Presidential
candidate Bill Clinton.
Gullan’s introductory joke
clearly addressed a vital is-
sue — Bill Clinton’s charac-
ter. Bill’s comment was
meant as a denouncement of
Clinton’s questionable
lifestyle, not as “a massive
negative generalization of

the women present”. When
a distraught member of the
audience expressed concern
over his joke, Bill sincerely
apologized for any harm
done. Certainly, to debase
Bill Gullan’s character and
integrity based on the misin-
terpretation of a joke is both
unreasonable and absurd.
Granted, Bill Gullan an-
gered some people in the au-
dience the night of the de-
bate. Bill did not, however.
fuel this resentment through
ad hominemattacks on those
disagreeing with him. Those
that became angry did so be-
cause they forsook reason
and embraced their tender

emotions. This was evident
to any calm observer of the
debate. Those offended be-
came enraged because of
Bill’s joke; instead, they
were confounded by Bill’s
ability to articulate the ben-
efit of the very ideas they
personally abhor. Nota per-
son witnessing the forum
could doubt Gullan’s ex-
traordinary ability to debate.
Bill Gullan should be con-
gratulated rather than con-
demned for his stellar per-
formance that night.

To the Editor,
AsaChristian, it grieves
me to see our nation slowly
deteriorate inits Biblical val-
ues. I know there is nothing
we can do to stop non-Chris-
tians from supporting such
moral abominations as: ho-
mosexuality (Lev. 20:13),
abortion-on-demand (Ps.
139:13-16), and the removal
of Judeo-Christian values

from our Constitution (Lev.

18:26). This painful fact is
truly a disgrace. But what
really perplexes me is that
many Christians are actually
supporting these immoral
actions through their choices
for government officials.
Shouldn’t we ask what
Christian values candidates
hold instead of whether they
are democrats or republi-
cans? After all, isn’t this a
nation “indivisible under

God”? I hear many people
talk about theeconomic situ-

. ation in this election. Does

human life (in the case of
abortion) not take precedent
over money in our pockets?
Ican only pray that the good

people of the country I love

will not make this horrible
mistake when they “pull the
lever” on election day.
Sincerely,
Chris Grubb ‘96
