Two Professors to

- Publish Books Soon

Studies of “Highway Systems” and
“Bear” Are in Hands of
Publishers

Dr. W. P. Cumming and Dr. C. K. Brown
of-the Davidson faculty have recently writ-
ten books which are at present in the hands
of the publishers.

Dr. W. P. Cumming, professor of English
at Davidson, has written a book on the
study of the bear. This particular study of
the animal was made an on island off the
coast of Alaska, during the past summer, and
deals .particularly with the brown and griz-
zly bear that habitate that part of the coun-
try.

The title of the book is, “My Friend the
‘Bear.” It consists of the experiences of the
author, during the past summer, while he
was in Alaska; also stories and anecdotes
gleaned from Mr. Holzworth, one of the

foremost hunters in the United States, and
Mr. Hassalborg, a trapper and prospector,
who has been hunting bears since the days of
98.

The island upon which the hunting was
done is about 140 miles long and 30 miles

in 1921. The modern highway system since
1921 is then thoroughly taken up and dis-
cussed in detail. Doctor Brown states that
there are now nearly nine thousand miles of
improved roads in‘the State, half of which
are. hard-surfaced. The North Carolina State
Highway System started its famous road-
building campaign in 1921 when a $50,000,000
bond was floated for road improvement and
building. Since then the roads of North
Carolina have steadily improved until today,
they rank among the best in the nation. Over
$115,000,000 is now invested in the public
highway of the State.

| America. While most of the hunting -was

done on the island, some time was spent on
the mainland, where the author and_ his
companions hunted the mountain goat.

Besides writing a book on the study of
the bear, a great many photographs in still
life were made, and 3,000 feet of film was
used in the study of moving life. Doctor
Cumming stated that this was one of the
finest and most complete studies of the bear
that has ever been accomplished in North
America. He also stated that he hoped to
have the film brought to Davidson to be
shown to the student body.

The book is still in the hands of the pub-
lisher, and no definite date has been made
for its publication, as yet.

The book was written by Doctor Cum-
ming in his spare moments, while he was
on the expedition. While hunting, he would
take notes, and again on rainy days when
he was confined to his cabin he would write
more extensively,

Dr. C. K. Brown, associate professor of
Economics will have his book, “The His-
tory of the State Highway System of North
Carolina” published in the coming spring.

Doctor Brown's treatise on the highway
system is both historical and analytical. The
first few chapers are devoted to the history
of public roads in North Carolina before the
inauguration of the State Highway System
