Triumph

The Student

Davidsonians

By KNOX ABERNETHY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
“It does strike us very forcibly that something about
this institution (Davidson) is most sadly out of joint,
stated the Chester, S. C., Standard. The paper was dis-
reat student insurrection of 1855, when
{ of the Davidson student body left school

because of a student-Faculty dispute.

cussing the
more than ha

On the night before Christ-
mas vacation, December 21,
1855, a group of students, re-
portedly “angered at the pres-
entation of some problems in
the recitation room, which they
could not solve,” rioted in front
of the College Chapel. Three
professors, Messrs. Rockwell,
Leland, and “old Major” Hill in-
vestigated, but, according to a
student’s account, were met by
a barrage of rocks, one of which
hit Major Hill.

FACULTY RETREATS

The Faculty retreated, ac-
cording to the student legend,
then counterattacked, “When
the insurgents saw in the star-
light the glistening of Major
Hill's Mexican sword, they fled
precipitately and sought con-
cealment in their rooms.”

The Faculty began a search
of the rooms, but, curiously
enough, all the students were
either studying or innocently
sleeping. All, that is, except
one. This student refused to let
the Faculty enter his room.
Finally, his door was broken
down with an ax, and he was
found asleep in bed, fully dress-
ed, even to his boots.

STUDENT SUSPENDED

The next day, he was sus-
pended from college for three
months because of “‘neglect of
his studies, . . . having used dis-
respectful language about a

Professor in a written essay,
and .. . strong circumstantial
evidence to convict him of hav-
ing participated in a Riot .. .”

The students demanded that
he be reinstated, since he had
been expelled on circumstantial |
evidence. The Faculty refused. |
After a great deal of noise, the |
students left for the Christmas |
holidays. |

ONLY THREE RETURN |

But only three students re-|
turned after the vacation. Near- |
ly the entire student body |
stayed away from Davidson in
protest of the Faculty’s action. |
For more than six weeks, col- |
lege activities had to be sus-|
pended simply because there |
were no students. But the Fac- |
ulty still refused to reinstate |
the suspended student.

Of the former 75 students, 31
eventually returned, most of |
whom were Freshmen. How- |
ever, the upper classes were so

severely depleted, that only)
three diplomas were given that |
year.

Rx-president Morrison sum-
marized the incident by writ-
ing, “This is only one result of
the former want of discipline,
and vitiated sentiment becom-
ing traditional with young men.
If the College only gets free |
from lawless and riotous stu-
dents it will do better here-
after.”

This $3200 represents the do-
nations and pledges of 57% of
the faculty and administration,
and 60% of the student body.
Three thousand dollars will pay
for a surgical table and lights.
‘The remaining $200 will be
used for any other equipment
necessary for the operation of

the hospital.
The campaign, which began
December 1, has been under the

A TALE WORKED OVER:

An Education For Alice

|. DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.

Alice went down, and down,
and down.

“How curious!” she thought.
“I cannot remember when first
I started to go down like this!”

Suddenly it ended. Thump!
Thump! Down she came upon
a heap of stick and dry leaves,
and her fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt; in
a moment she jumped up and
looked around.

The White Rabbit had fled.
She was standing in a muddy
wood, apparently on a high hill.
She looked up, but it was dark
overhead; in the distance she
could faintly discern a cluster
of domed and columned build-
ings.

“How exciting!” exclaimed’
Alice, “I may be in ancient

before Alice.
“Is this Rome?” cried Alice
to the Pig.
“Naw, dearie,” moaned the
Pig, “but it’s hell on Christians
all the same.” The Pig began
to ruffle her skirts. “Darn.
Lookit that. My tail is a mess.”
“Why are you running away?
Is this place perilous?” asked
Alice.

queried Alice, “what has been
happening down there?”

“You'll hafta see it to be-
lieve it,” said the Queen,
lumbering off across the hill.
“G'wan down there. But
watch out for the blond guy
in the waistcoat; he’s pretty
raunchy.”

Alice started. The White Rab-

bit!

She began to run down the
hill. “How curious!” she
thought.

il. THE MAD TEA-PARTY

The columned buildings were
deserted. Alice could hear mu-
sic and voices in the distance,
but she knew not where they
were.

She stopped before the larg-
est building. Insciribed above
the columns were some curious
words. “How curious!” exclaim-
ed Alice.

Suddenly she heard a voice:
“Hiya, baby. You unattached?”

The White Rabbit, clad in a
paisley waistcoat, stood behind
her.
“Where—where did you come
from?” Alice cried.

“Beautiful but naive,” mut-
tered the Rabbit—and then to
Alice: “You wanna go to the
party with me? My date—damn
pig—ran off somewhere.”

move forward.

“How extraordinary!”
thought.

Presently they stopped. They
had come to a low hall, hung
outside with lights. From in-

side came shouts and the
thumping of great drums. The
Rabbit led her inside. The hall
was dark, and deserted but for
a cluster of Nubians or Ethio-
pians about the drums.

“Are they Hottentots?”
quired Alice.

“Right,” said the Rabbit, and
began to sing again: “ .. . Get
‘em atta peanut stan, yeah,
yeah, yeah .. .” Alice was sil-
ent.

Presently they walked to
a table upon which rested a
tall bottle. Tied round the

in-

neck of the bottle was a pa-
per label with the words
“DRINK ME” printed in large
letters.

“How curious!" said Alice.

“Aw, g’wan,” said The Rab-
bit. “Live a little.”

“No, I'll look first,” she said,
“and see if it’s marked poison
or not.”

“Christ,” moaned the Rabbit.
“How foggy can a girl get?”

However, this bottle was NOT
marked “poison”, so Alice ven-
tured to taste it, and finding it
very nice, she very soon finish-
ed it off.

“What a curious feeling!”
said Alice; “I must be shutting
up like a telescope!”

“God forbid,” said the Rabbit,
and he took a drink from the
bottle.

Alice felt very queer indeed.

Finally her eyes focussed
again and she looked about
the hall. Many people were
arriving. She looked at the
Rabbit. He was chuckling

‘dents will submit papers for
leriticisms and discussion by
other students from Sewanee,
Emory, Agnes Scott, and the

central theme for this year's
conference is existentialism.
The conference, now in its
eighth year; was originated by
the philosophy departments at
Sewanee and Emory. Davidson
students have participated for
the past five years. An inter-
esting feature of this confer-

allowed to participate in any
of the discussions.
