Hitting

The Trails In Lander, Wyoming

By Julian Cochran

It’s that fantastic and exciting
time in each of our dreams that
begins upon entering the bizarre
and mostly confusing world of
college...JY A! Each year, many of
us at Davidson set off and wander
away from the solid and never-
changing foundations of what we
call college life.

With our hearts filled with grief
over not being able to slave and
stress over papers and exams or
endure the fabled weekend court
parties for a whole semester or
worse, the whole year, we take that
giant leap to begin the process of
what our parents call “finding
yourself,” I’ve been pleased that
The Davidsonian has printed ar-
ticles on what some of my other
classsmates did on their semesters
abroad, beacuse I’ve been wanting
to know if their time off was as
rewarding as mine.

kids would generally be stuck with
old Paul for thirty days. By the
time they returned to the East coast,
well, they had learned just about
everything about wilderness camp-

I think it was the first time I had ever earnestly
given thanks for anything -- the fact that I was
alive and enjoying the beauty around me.

Way back in 1965, even be-
fore Birkenstocks were in vogue, a
good-old farm boy by the name of
|Paul Petzholdtstarted a wilderness
expedition school for East coast,
city-slicker kids just like you and
me! Well, old Paul operated his
schoo out of Lander, Wyoming,
|and used to take these aforemen-
' tioned kids up into the woods near
' the Grand Tetons, close to Jackson
Hole, Wyoming.
Once out in the woods, these

and general: survival that Paul
knew. And, after being the young-
est person ever to climb the Grand
Teton (which he did at age 14, and
he was only the second person to
doso successfully) as well as being
the head of the Colorado Outward
Bound School for many years, he
knew a good deal about wilderness
survival.

Inthe 1980s and 1990s, NOLS
has emerged as being one of the

premier schools of outdoor educa-
tion. So, the whole story of Paul
relates back to a kid from North
Carolina, that would be me, who
decided in the Spring of 1990 that
he would do a Fall Semester in the
Rockies.

My decision to do a ninety-
four day wilderness course was
not an easy one. I had originally
planned to go abroad, and do the
foreign study thing until I decided,
“Hey-if you can’tenjoy the beauty
that your own country has to offer,
how can you enjoy anything?” So
I got a NOLS brochure. And I
applied. And I got in. The whole
thing seemed so far away and
completely foreign to what I was

_used to, that I had no idea of what

I was getting into: intense physical
demands and enviromental haz-
ards. And let me tell you, I was so
nervous flying out to Wyoming
that Icould barely swallow. I think

East escalating, and no hope of a

peaceful solution, some consider
it futile to look back to see what
went wrong. But one issue still
‘| lingers in the minds of many: is
this a war for oil?

Even President Bush admits

in this war, and it would be either
naive or stupidity for any Ameri-
can to think otherwise. Our na-
tion is the nation most dependent
on oil. It is also the most depend-
ent on foreign oil.

- Weareanation obsessed with
consumption, and this realization
| leads many to inquire aboutalter-
| nativeenergy methods. Could our
nation survive without sucha vast
dependency on oil? Do we really
need to be fighting this war for
oil?

‘Whether or not one agrees
that this is a war for oil, one must
inevitably face the grave situation
the United States is in: our de-
pendence on oil has drained our
country’s oil resources and our
unwillingness to change our con-

that oil is a primary consideration”

suming habits may be the greatest
downfall of our future.

The facts are clear. The United
States uses oil halfas efficiently as
Japan. Ourcars get fewer miles per
gallon than any other industrial-
ized nation. Most of our oil is for-
eign oil, since the continental
United States holds less than five
percent of the world’s oil reserves.
Fossil fuels are the cause of a lead-
ing emergency facing our genera-
tion, namely global warming. So
why are we so unwilling as a na-
tion tochange our habits in order to
make our futures brighter and
longer-lasting? Are we simply too
stubborn, comfortable, or set in

~ our ways to try to pull together and

change? Are we willing to sacri-
fice ourselves, our nation, and our

‘ world for the-sake of immediate

gratification? Come on! You andI
together have got to change our
ways so that we have a future, and
so that we don’t take our future
away!

term changes we can all make,
starting right this very moment.

office, walk. When it’s cold out-
side and you would rather take a
ride up the hill, put on a hat.
When you go to buy a new car,
look at its efficiency, not just for.
your wallet, but also for your air.
Make sure that before you tum
up the heat, the windows are
closed. Carpool. Drive the speed
limit. Recycle. Plant a tree. Turn
off the water while you brush
your teeth. Turn out the lights
when you leave your room or a
room in Chambers. Most impor-
tantly, talk about the environ-
ment and reducing consumption
with others. Everyone should be
aware and active in protecting
the environment and our futures.
Knowledge about this nation’s
habits, as well as your own hab-
its, can really make a difference.
Maybe, if we all start to make a
difference, oil will not bea factor
which takes our sons and daugh-
ters away to war. Just think about

The Incredible Ease Of Well Being

By Marlo Cobb

D.A. Thompson showed up
at my door the other day with a
Smith & Wesson. I wasn’t home.
Later he saw me walking across
campus. There was a chase...
After 2 seconds he stopped and
had a coughing fit, so I live to
write another article.

Here’s a fact for you: Right
after New Year’s, the average city
health club signs 20-30 new
members per day. The number
diminishes drastically as the year
rolls on, of course, but January 1
and its resolutions are a large part
of whatkeeps health clubs in busi-
ness. Right about now is when
lack of time and lack of motiva-
tion lead to forgotten New Year’s
resolutions.

Have you given up yet? If you
haveno time to exercise for a
while, don’t despair.

Unlike on-again-off-again
diets, “yo-yo” exercise habits
aren’t harmful. You can always
rebuild muscle; it’s adaptable to
Stress situations after extreme
couch-potato periods.

Obviously, repeated contrac-
tion of muscle fibers against re-
sistance causes muscles to in-
crease in size, as well as in
strength. The strength part is a
more important result of exercise
for women, however, because

are identical to men’s, their gen-
erally smaller body frames and
low levels of testosterone (a
hormone which builds protein)
don’ tallow forthe muscle buildup
which occurs in men.

- Justlike fatcells, you’re born
with all the muscle fibers you'll
ever have. When youare inactive,
these fibers shrink, or atrophy.
Muscular endurance, the ability
that muscles have to turn oxygen
intoenergy, greatly decreases after
3-4 weeks of inactivity, but mus-
cular strength takes longer to dis-
appear -- up to a year of inactivity
should do it.

The more inactive you are,
the faster this will happen. A
worst-case scenario is probably

even though their muscle fibers ©

Than None At All

having tohavea limb in acast for
amonthor so, as anyone who has
brokena leg will understand. And
for astronauts, a no-gravity situ-
ation is another sure way to
weaken muscle tissue.

Metabolism is a factor, too.
Most people think of a high me-
tabolism as something inherently
good; you will burn more calo-
ries per minute at any given ac-
tivity. But with inactivity, your
muscles will atrophy faster, as
well. Metabolism applies to all
bodily functions; when your
metabolism is high, everything
about your system is sped up,
compared to a person with a low
metabolism. This is one explana-
tion for why NASA’sexperimen-
tal rats’ muscles atrophied five
times faster in space than hu-
man’s would.

So, you’re inactive, You’rea
Davidson student, after all, and
there’s no time. Well, if you’re
not working out, you could take
the stairs in Chambers, walk to
your 8:15 instead of driving up
the hill ... anything helps.

In the long run, however,
nothing can take the place of
routinely working out in some
way, SO get back into it, eventu-
ally. Don’t jump back into the
before-couch-potato routine,
though. Work your way back up.
A formerly inactive muscle un-
der too much stress is adamaged
muscle. “No pain, no gain” is
out. |

And it’s never too late -- the
muscular weakness associated
with older folks is due partly toa
less active lifestyle. A study done
involving women in their mid-
60’s to mid-80’s shows ‘that
strength can be regained with
exercise even in later years.

From this and other studies,
it can even be inferred that well-
meaning friends and family who
“help out” elderly acquaintances
by doing their chores (laundry,
cleaning house, etc.) for them
may actually be taking away an
important way for them to keep
in shape.
