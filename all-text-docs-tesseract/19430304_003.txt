PORTS
POTLIGHT

BY JIM JACKSON

Leading sports experts rate Duke and George
Washington as certain finalists in the current Southern
Conference eliminations. From this corner there seem“
to be forces which may or may not break up this
general consensus of opinion One is the fact that the
favorite or favorites rarely come through in the S. C.
tourneys, and another is the Davidson Wildcats. The
former theory is flexible, the latter a matter of
past performance and fighting spirit. Tonight the ’Cats

- meet State. If they win they must tackle, in all prob-
ability, George Washington. Belk is back, though on
probation with regards to his ankle, and if Tommy and
the ’Cats are hot, it’s a right spot for an upset. Here’s

hoping.

There are many things about this year’s cagers you can't
iorget, and many more you won't forget. You-can’t lay aside
that sparkling record of seventeen wins and only five losses,
nor. can you cover up Tommy Peter’s scoring spree. And it
will be plenty hard to lose recollection of ‘ommy’s snake shots
under the basket, George’s backhand passes and uncanny tree
throw accuracy, Wayman’s backhand flips, and Long John’s
iloor work. Nor will Lowry’s five long ones before the game

and all-out performance throughout,

jackie byrd’s speedy

breaks, Johnny Frederick’s and Pat William's ‘spirited and
deadly play, and the entire fighting spirit of the ‘Cats, especially
that of Bob Currie, Shotgun Sutton, Bill Hodgin and Ed White,
be easily forgotten. Win or lose, they were never beaten.

A climax in spirit was attained one week ago Tues-
day night in our gym when the ’Cats came from behind
in the final few moments to top a towering Citadel
quintet, 48-44 Never before has the student body gone
so all-out for victory, and never have they been so
proud of their team’s play and victory. The win not
only inched the ’'Cats a notch higher in the conference
standings but, coupled with the triumph over Clem-
son, gave the locals the third ranking spot in tourna-

ment seedings.

Topping the intramural basketball race at the present
time are the Betas, with a record of four wins and no losses,
Monday night they trounced a strong Fiji five, 36-28, and

Foul Shots

A little-heralded, but all-important factor in the
Wildcat’s drive to 17 victories this year was their
ability to out-average their opponents on the free
throw line. A marked example was the initial clash
with The Citadel, in which they garnered 16 points
by gratis tosses to the Bulldogs 1, and won by

merely 5 tallies.

In. this fracus as in others, George

Peters shone with his foul shots, and maintained a
lofty number of completions per game all season.

Among the numerous post-game announcements by the
publicity departments of losing teams was the_ publication
in the Gamecock, South Carolina’s fine publication;--which

stated that the Gamecock’s key men were sick the night they

lina by a similar margin, and we’ll stack up the ’Cats against

the Birds now or then.

THE OPEN FORUM
(Continued from Page 2)
they were amazingly quiet and sub-
dued considering their age. I have
no idea who they were, but. am
making a plea to all parents if the
community that they not ‘permit
their children to attend such events,
under any circumstances. Children
were made to play and not to go

to concerts.
On the surface, it would seem in

this particular case that the respec-
tive parents found a convenient way
to keep their children occupied,
and yet leave them free to attend
the concert. Note will be taken
that the parents in question were
nowhere near their respective sons.
They were probably in the back
of the auditorium somewhere enjoy-
ing the program. I am glad that
someone did.

Plans for the coming season are
indefinite due to material, oppo-

success on the cinder path if a

Last year the ’Cats had a most
successful season, triumphing easily

South Carolina. Leader of the spiked
