very name, Homecoming Day, is
significant. The alumni who return
on that day are simply coming back
home, back to their Alma Mater.
Your presence will add much to
the good cheer of the day and will
bring us encouragement and in-
spiration for days to come, We al-
ways think of the alemni as the
best friends that a college has.

Je wish also to extend a hearty
welcome to the football squad,
members of the faculty and of the
student body, from Centre College.

Davidson and Center are very
close akin in their history, their
ideals, and their traditions. Not

only so, but the president of Cen-
tre is an®alumnus of Davidson Col-
lege. So, we say to our friends
from Centre, thrice welcome.

We are hoping that it is going
to be a great day, a real red-letter
day in the history of Davidson Col-
lege. One striking feature of the
day will be the return of the foot-

ball squad of 1910.o That was the
team which won the first state
championship in North Carolina.

There were mighty men of valor

in those days. The presence of the’

members of that notable squad will
add much to the day. So, here is a
hearty welcome for them too. They
will be an inspiration to the foot-
ball squad of 1940 and help them
to maintain the fine spirit and tra-
ditions of the Davidson team.

As the program for the day will
be printed in another place, I need
not repeat it here.

plained the method of extending a

member of O.D.K. rose, went into
the student body, and tapped ‘one
of the members to whom a bid was
to be extended. Each man so tapped
signified his acceptance of the hon-
or by following the old member
back to the stage where was
presented with a_ formal
bid.

Addition of these seniors

ship of O.D.K. to 13 students, be-

active faculty members. Old stu-

administration fully aware of
her arbor heritage, and devotes a
great deal of money and attention
to its preservation. Mr. F. D. Ho-
bart, local superintendent of grounds
and buildings, is constantly looking
after the condition of the arbors, In
addition, a special tree surgeon is
brought to the campus every two
or three years to examine and, if
necessary, treat each tree.

Comparatively few of the arbors
are part of the original forest from
which Davidson’s campus was laid
out. Several of these trees, mostly
large, can still be seen near Elm
and Oak rows and the literary so-
ciety halls. But the whole of the
trees here now have been planted

lalmost yearly for over 100 years.
|In the earlier days of the cdllege

/and awarded certain privileges for
Latanttig a tree. President Wilson,
when he was a student here, is said
to have planted one in 1874, and
today that one is called the Wood-
row Wilson Tree. Other memorial
trees include the George Washing-

|ton Tree and the Napoleon Bona-

parte Tree.

In his‘poem, “Trees,” Joyce Kil-
mer has written, “But only God
can make a tree.” One has only to
drink in the autumnal grandeur of
Davidson's arbors to realize what
a wonderful creation they are.

What may prove to be the most
important contribution to racial
drama was launched last Monday
night when the Negro Playwrights
Co. launched-Fheodore Ward's “Big
White Fog.”

A drama of social significance at
ADD the collegian broadway ----
once moving and thoughtful, “Big
White Fog” traces the deteriora-
tion and collapse of a Negro fam-
ily through the futile attempt to
escape race barriers. Mr. Ward
makes it plain that he believes the
one hope for his race is to seek

salvation in Communism.
Sav k ket of
On Friday, “Cabin in the Sky,”
another Negro acted but white

man inspired musical drama (John
LaTouche wrote the words; Ver-
non Duke, the music) was touched
off.

With Ethel Waters balancing
most of the fantasy on her compe-
tent head, the production could not
help but tome off well. Critics were
rather lyric, to which rare mood
Katherine Dunham and her colored
ballet, and Rex Ingram, who played
“De Lawd” in the Movie version of
“Green Pastures,” ntributed.

The Eternal Ballet

If you are within 100 miles of an

invasion point of that organization
called the Monte Carlo Ballet
Russe, for heaven's sake go pay

them a visit. Verily this is Senor
Ponce de Leon's vaunted fountain
of youth. The sight of these airy

creatures making a sap out of
Newton’s law of gravitation — is
something positively out of the

world. Also, if you're disenchanted
with women, it provides an oppor-
tunity for that wonderful agony, a
crush on a. ballerina.

“The New Yorker,” “Nutcracker

class should at least foot the bill
for the painty ;

Gaines Stubbins and Finley Tuck-
er, who actually climbed the lad-
dergand did the painting, say they
got a big scare when they were
about half way\ up and happened
to look down into the enormous
chasm of nothingness below them.
The one on the bottom while
climbing was always insistent that
the one above not fall, if you
please. After they got up and per-
formed their work of. art, they
had a hard time persuading them-
selves that they wanted to come
down at all. The remaining paint
was left up on the tank, perhaps
for the convenience of futu@e paifit-
ers, but more likely so that. they
wouldn't have to lug it down again.

The boys deny vehemently that
they had anything to do with the
later painting and with their paint
being knocked off and spattering
the monuments" in the cemetery.
This deed is now blamed on the
mysterious campus painter who
does his work before football
games. The freshman painters
think that the football boosters at
least could have found another
spot on the tank to do their work
rather than cover their 4D4.
Stubbins wants it
to clearly understood that if
there is to be any more tank paint-
ing, someone else will have to do
it.

History

Homecoming Day as it now ex-
ists was first celebrated on Novem-,
ber 13, 1926. Before this a holiday
known as Davidson College Day
and Armistice Day had been ob-
served every November 11, but
this had none of the features now
enjoyed at Homecoming.

At the first Homecoming Day 14
years ago, Richardson Stadium was
dedicated, and the Davidson foot-
ball team won a 10-0 victory over
the University of North Carolina.
