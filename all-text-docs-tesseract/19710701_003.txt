Admissions Hires Two:
Strong To Recruit Blacks

tg interested black appli
cants.

Miller was an assistant di-
rector of admissions at
Albion College, Albion, Mich..
from 1966-70. He obtained
an A.B. degree from Albion
in 1966 and an M.A. from
Michigan Sbvate University

Broadbent, has been an
admissions counselor’ at
Drury College in Springfield,

been completing work for

Fuller Assists HEW Commissioner

' Assistant Professor of Poii-
tical Science Jon W: ‘Fuller
moved to Washington D.C.
this summer where he will
assume his duties as Special
Assistant to the U.S, Com-
missioner of Education.

Working in the Depart
ment of Health, Education

and Welfare (HDW), Fuller .

will become one of two
special assistants to U.S.
Commissioner of Education
Sydney Marland.

Fuker will perform a num-
ber af tasks including hiason
work between the education
br. of HEW and Con
gress. He will answer ques
tions and write letters to
keep congressmen abreast of
educational problems.
When the commissioner
vestifies before a congres
sional committee, Fuller will
be alongside to handle refer-
ences and files.
Although he may even do
some research work from
time to time, Fuller said that
most of his gutles will be
d'recied toward making the
commissioner of education
more effective.

Fuller had originally con-
twcted “an Oxford buddy" of
his who worked under Pat-
rick Moynihan in the White
House. Since there were no
vacancies there, the political
science professor was direct-

ed to HEW where. he was
hired vo work in the edu-

cation branch.

This job is a political ap-
pointment for Fuller; he has
no civil service rating. ‘‘But
if Nixon doesn't get elected
in ‘72, TH be out looking
for another job,” he said.

Fuller sought this position
because he wanted to have
some administrative and po
tical experience. ‘‘Appar.
ently this is a very desirable
job and is considered a good
credential for olher govern-
ment positions,’’ he said.

He also said he fett he was
getting ‘‘stale’’ in Davidson.
“This was the first year
since I've been ‘here that I
didn feel frightened when
I watked into the class.
room,” he said. ‘This, I felt.
was a bad sign. Things were

Fuller safd that his de
cision to seek the job in gov-
ernment was a matter of
priorities. ‘I was beginning
to spend more and more time
on routine cammittees bere.
and less on more worthwhile
things,”” he said. “I didn’:
feel I was being very ef-
fective.”

After further conversation.
however, Fuller admitted he
wasn’t very happy in David-
son.

“The students were great
vo work with, tthat was the
one great value to being
here,’ he said. ‘“‘But my wife

and I found that small towns
have disadvantages.

“We found that if your life
isn't centered around child-
ren or the church, you don’t
fit in,’ he continued.

“Although it was our
choice to fraternize socially
with the students, it is still
significant that after living
here four years, I gan only
te.l you where half the fa-
cuty live. And I have only
been invited to maybe one
quarter of their homes."

The school was another
tactor in Fuller’s decision to
leave. He said that he was
leaving a little sooner than
he expeeted, but this was
because Davidson is getting
to be an umlappy place.

“The college administra-
tion is faced with a very
serious morale problem,'’ he
said ‘‘And I think much of
this is due to this admini-
siration’s insensitivity to
people's feelings.

“Things are dane so abre
sively around here. Every
thing is in continual turmoil.
You know, you can get alot
of mileage out of consulting
people and letting them talk,
things out. But this doesn't
get done around here.” he
said

The ‘political science pro
iessor said that he had seen
no reduction in the standards

of the Davidson student as
other members of the faculty
have indicated.

“However, this college is
going to have to become coed
in order for it to atiract good
s‘udents,"’ he said.

Fuller emphasized that
vilese were just his criticisms
c’ Davidson in hope that they
may be corrected. He said
he was not bitter toward
‘he college. In fact he indi-
cated he may want to come
back someday.

his masver’s degree. He re-
ceived an A.B. from Drury
in 1965 and did graduate
werk in psychiatric social
work at Syracuse University
during 1965-66.

Miller will concentrate on
financial aid and Broadbent
on admissions.

Miller succeeds Peter
Sterling, who will remain at
Davidson as program coor-
dinator of the College Union,
and Broadbent succeeds Jon
Regen, who will be study-
ing at Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, Va.

Suwrong has already begun
to recruit blacks this sum
mer, ‘and he will continue in
to the school vear on a part-
time basis.

“The competition for qua-
lified black college appli-
cants is very stiff between
colleges across the country."
Strong said.

“It is equally as difficult
lo recruit a black as it is to
recruit a football or basket-
bail player,” he continued.
“This is why Davidson must
concentrate on attracting
blacks to the school.”’

ed one year here. When ap-
proached by the telephone
campaign, he ended up giv-
ing $1,000!"

Corneil said that an organ.
ized campaign in the future
should increase the amount
donated to the fund.

“Of course I'm _ happy
abou: entting up in the black
nis year.” Cornell said.
“Very few schools in the
country enjoy this luxury.

“It used to be that colleges
and universities would hold
campaigns to increase their
endowment,’’ he continued.
“now they have fund drive
campaigns to offset their de-
ficits.

Cornell said that Davidson
had to contend with a num-

ber of fimancia] hazards this
year.

A steady inflationary fac-
tor of four to five per cent
raised prices and overhead.

The economic slump which
set in last year decreased
“he amount of money derived
from the college endowment
along with Duke endowment.
~The minumum wage was
increased and the unemploy.
ment compensation act was
passed which dropped an
additional expense of $17,000
on the college.

“With all these things to
contend with, it is a tribute
not only to ithe business of.
fice, but also to the entire
academic community for try-
ing to conserve funds.”
Cornell said.
