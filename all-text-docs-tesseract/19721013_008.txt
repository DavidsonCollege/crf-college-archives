Furman Team
Reports Virus

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

Monday it was learned that
there was a virus spreading
through the Furman football
camp. Wednesday Furman
Sports Information Director
Charlie Dayton confirmed this
fact.

‘*We had 23 men out Monday,
but yesterday they dressed in
sweats,’’ Dayton explained.
“We do expect them to be ready
to play on Saturday, however."

The extent to which this in-
cident will affect the Paladins
remains a mystery. Dayton
thought that it was a minor oc-
curance, since practice was
‘just hampered."

If there were any key players
on the squad that were out,
there was no mention of it.

Assuming that everyone
returns to practice by Thur-
sday, there will probably be no

reat effect on the conditions
or the game, according to Day-
ton.

The Furman players first
complained of the illness after
returning from their game last
Saturday with Western
Carolina. The nature of the
iliness was undetermined by
spokesmen for the team, other
than to call it *‘a small virus”.

Few students other than foot-
ball players have been affected
by the illness.

drive, the Cat defensive team
gave up only 114 yards the rest
of the game.

Led by Shipp and Ingold, the
Cat offense gained 426 yards.

Ingold, a junior running back
from High Point, had a great
afternoon, picking up 105 yards
on 22 carries.

He also was on the receiving
end of seven Shipp passes, for a
total of 60 yards.

Upon being asked how he felt
about the team's performance,
Ingold replied, ‘‘I felt good a-
bout the team's performance
as a whole, except for the fact

that we didn't win the football

game.

Ingold also said “The of-
fensive line did a fantastic job
and the defense played really
well too."

Shipp also had a fine game,
completing 22 of 35 passes for
247 yards with no interceptions.

The lone Wildcat touchdown
was a 43 yard aerial from Shipp

to flanker Walt Walker.

Walker managed to get
behind a prevent defense
thrown up by the Mountaineers
and took the perfectly thrown
Shipp pass for the score.

Walker proved to be a
menace to the Appalachian
defence all afternoon, catching
5 passes for 100 yards.

The touchdown pass came
with just 24 seconds showing on
the clock in the first half, and
gave the Cats a 7-3 lead during
intermission.

Little did they know that they
would never cross the goal line
again.

Time and time again, the Ap-
palachian defense rose up to
thwart scoring opportunities by
the Cats.

One first half Wildcat drive
was halted when offensive pass

was sacked behind the line after
being pressured by a tremen-

With the score 10-7 in favor of
Appalachian, the Wildcats mar-
ched 80 yards, only to be stop-
ped at the Mountaineer four
yard line.

From there, senoir Woody
Montgomery booted a 21 yard
field goal to knot the score at 10-
10.

After the ensuing Wildcat
kick-off, the Mountaineers
worked their way into Davidson
territory, only to lose the ball on
a fumble.

Then the Wildcats took over.
Shipp, using his backs and tight-
end Mike Harding, moved the
Cats to the Mountaineer 12 yard
line for a first down with just
over a minute left in the game.

After three plays moved the
ball to the six yard line, Mon-
tgomery came in to try for a
game-winning 23 yard field
goal.

His boot was barely wide to
the left, however, and the Cats
settled for a tie, much to the
disappointment of the highly
partisan Wildcat crowd and
team.

Coach Dave Fagg was
pleased with the team's per-
formance, however.

k'agg commented on the Wild-
cat effort by saying, ‘Saturday
was one of the highlights of my
coaching career at Davidson.”

He then characterized the
game as being a “near perfect
game" on the parts of both
teams.

Fagg then singled out Eddie
Womack, Mike Creaseman,
Woody Montgomery. Jim
DeVille. Jimmy Hardison, and
John West as defensive stan-
douts for the Wildcats.

When the Furman Paladins

invade Davidson tomorrow,
there is more at stake than a
football game.
* The Wildcats will be plugging
to regain their pride as a
Southern Conference contender
and end a two-year skid at their
Opponents’ hands.

Head coach Dave Fagg,
jJespite feeling low after the tie
with Appalachian, is impressed
with the offensive and defensive
lisplavs that the Wildcats show-
2d last week.

‘‘We are a good team,” Fagg
sommented. ‘‘We can win. We
ire trying to develop a true
tharacter of winning here at
Javidson."

The Furman team _ will
rovide more opposition than
id the Mountaineers, ac-
ording to Fagg.

Mike Shelton, their fine quar-
terback, has an exceptional
throwing arm and their passing
game should prove to be a big
test for the secondary of the

Womack, a ore, was
later voted “Player of the
Week'’ in the Southern Con-
ference, on defense.

Fagg also praised Ingold,
Shipp, Walker, Alton McAllum,
and Jim Kleinfelder as the keys
to the offensive effort.

Ingold was second in the
voting for the ‘Offensive
Player of the Week"’ in the
Southern Conference.

Wildcats.

“They will definitely throw
more than the Mounties did,”
explained Fagg. *‘I expect them
to be more effective also."’

Fagg is planning a re-
emphasis in the defensive
organization to compensate for
this difference. There will be
no basic structural changes in
the alignment, however.

Fagg feels the team is ready
for the challenge. The unit is
physically healthy and men-
tally ready.

‘“We think the boys can bounce
back,’ he said. ‘‘We are men-
tally up for this one.”’

The Furman passing game
will originate from a com-
bination of the Houston veer
and a pro-type passing set for-
mation.

This will be entirely new to
the Wildcat defense. Fagg
deems it a true test of a team’s
ability to put together an effort
that shows the willingness to
adapt quickly to a new ex-
perience.

Offensively, the Davidson
gridders will be out to do the
same thing they did to Ap-
palachian last week, with one
essential exception. The Wild-
cats are determined to carry
the ball across the goal line.

The line play by both the
defensive and offensive units
was highly praised by Fagg.

Pass protection was a definite
plus in the attack against the
Apps, he said.

Defensively, the Wildcats put
constant pressure on the
passer, while plugging the gaps
with great consistency.

Dave Ingold, who ripped off
207 yards worth of total offense
last week, will be the premier
