Football Team Honored
At Elaborate Banquet
Gaston County Alumni Entertained

for Players and Coaches Last
Thursday Night

Davidson College alumni in Gaston Coun-
ty gave an elaborate banquet to the football
team of Davidson last Thursday at the Ma-
sonic Temple in Gastonia, approximately 45
people being in attendance. Only three cars
of Davidson representatives could be there,
due both to classroom work for some, and
inclement weather for others. It was declared
by practically every one from Davidson to
be one of the best affairs they had ever at-
tended.

Fred L. Smyre, 1900, of Gastonia, presi-
dent of the Gaston County Alumni Associa-
tion, presided at the banquet, and after sev-
eral delicious courses had been served he
introduced Hugh A. Query, ’09, editor of
The Gastonia Gazette, who formally ex-
tended a welcome to the team, coaches and
visitors.

Numerous people were called upon for
short talks, during the evening, including
F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the college; W.
L. Younger, coach; Jos. B. Johnston, '01,
president of Barium Springs Orphanage;
Ralph McMillan, '26, athletic coach at Bar-
ium; Ernest Milton, alumni secretary ; Thad
Brock, 1929 captain of the team; William
Sparrow, '27; R. D. Hall, 19; Rev. R. J.
Hunter, 93; Rev. T. G. Tate, ‘10; D. R.
LaFar, '22; Sam A. Robinson, 99; Coit M.
Robinson, 10; Dr. R. E. Rhyne, ’08, and J.
Lee Robinson, a trustee.

One of the features of the affair was an
impromptu comedy skit by three of the foot-
ball player's, Joe McCall, Hub Covington and
Bill Mason. They had not prepared to give
a rendition of their act, but obliged the in-
sisting people.

At the conclusion of fhe meeting officers
for the coming year were chosen. The nomi-
nating committee of LaFar, Query, and Spar-
row brought in the names of R. D. Hall, of
Belmont, ’19, for president, and W. T. Spen-
cer, ’26, of Gastonia, for secretary-treasurer.
These men were unanimously elected.

The theme of the entire meeting was the
success which the Davidson team and
coaches had enjoyed during the 1929 season,
but the trend of thought deviated, and splen-
