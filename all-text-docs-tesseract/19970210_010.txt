Lyrical slam dancing

New York Poets perform verbal gymnastics

By Erica RIssING
& HEATHER ROOTE
Guest Writers

The New York Poets performed
an array of spoken word pieces to
an enthusiastic audience on Satur-
day night. Members of the troupe
included Emily XYZ, Myers
Bartlett, Everton Sylvester,
Samantha Coerbell, and Hal
Sirowitz. Two students, Jennifer
(Rufus) McGillan and Cintra Pol-
lack each read one of their own
poems which they had shred at the
poets’ workshop earlier in the after-
noon.

Afterrelating her grandfather’ s
statement that poetry was the only
thing worth doing, Pollack read her
poem off of a napkin, adding to the
spontaneity of the evening.

This spirit was manifested in
the audience’s response to the nar-
rative and conversational style,
showing their enthusiasm with open
questions, laughter, and comments.
For example, Sirowitz’s repeated
line “Mother Said” encouraged the
audience to join in and try to predict
exactly when the poet would say it

next. In the workshop, Sirowitz
explained he intended his poems to
reach out to everyone, and most
everyone could relate to the stereo-
typical nagging mother. After call-
‘ing himself a stand-up poet,
Stirowitz revealed timing as the key
to his humor, saying “I work with
silence the way musicians work with
sounds.”

Bartlett and XYZ performed
pieces for two voices, written in is

.in two columns, one for each

speaker, but the works cannot con-
vey in writing the way those two
voices overlap, go solo, or are in
chorus with each other when spo-

- ken, creating a pulsing rhythm. The

power of the work could only be
experienced by hearing it per-
formed; it is not meant as a written
art form, but as part of the new
genre of poetry that is considered
“spoken word.”
XYZ, the author of these pieces,
explained the essence of the works
as sounds and words that are com-
municated to the audience and the
artists, and she considers herself
not a poet but a performer. As she
stated, “Put it this way: this year we
are coming out with a record, not a

Four play in Hodson

The biggest event of the year
for sackbut enthusiasts arrived on
Wednesday night. The much an-
ticipated Davidson College Trom-
bone Quartet recital, as advertised
by a creative and elaborate flyer
campaign masterminded by the per-
formers themselves, featured se-
niors Steve Duncan and Ethan
McCutchen, junior Lewis Hoffman,
and his father David Hoffman. The
ensemble played an eclectic array
of pieces, ranging from music of the
late Renaissance through the rag-

~ time:and swing styles’ of the early
- 20th Century.

The variety of literature, com-
bined with the soothing yet power-

ful sound of the brass, kept the
_ audience enthralled throughout the

performance. The first half was
highlighted by a Gabrieli Sonata
and the Brahms arrangement of “Eis
isteine Roseentsprungen,” although
one member of the audience found
the final resolution of J.S. Bach’s
Contrapunctus IX so moving that
she exclaimed, “That was beauti-
ful!” amid shivers.

The excerpts from Quatre
Pieces by Jean-Michel Defaye, the
sole composition of the ten per-
formed works that was originally
written for four trombones, show-
cased a high level of technical pro-
ficiency from both the students and
from “Papa Naked” Hoffman, a
graduate of the Manhattan Institute
of Music.

Following intermission, the
quartet, dressed in black from head
to foot, demonristrated such an im-
pressive aptitude of stylistic sensi-
tivity that they. were able to bring
even the music of Anton Bruckner
to life (Adiago from his Symphony
No.7). Two works of Mendelssohn
and Debussy were followed by a
couple of ragtime melodies, with
Ethan and Lewis briefly lending
vocals to Joplin’s “Tiger Rag.”

The recital will probably be the
group’s'first and last annual perfor-
mance at Davidson (as Duncan in-
formed the audience). When asked
if they enjoyed performing in
Hodson Hall, however, Lewis re-

sponded for the group, stating, -

“Word.”
The sentiments of the audience
were emphatically similar. cee

book.”

XYZ feels this gives her work
a certain immediacy that written
words don’t have. She is not con-
cerned with pleasing an academic
or future audience; she wants direct
contact with her audience in order
to make poetry alive, accessible and
acceptable for 20th Century Ameri-
cans, The group emphasizes chang-
ing the perception of poetry from
stuffy and academic to its definition
as a democratic experience that is
relevant to society as a whole. The
audience seemed to agree, with one
member stating, “I think it was a
hell of a lot more entertaining than
most people’s conception of a po-
etry reading.”

In addition to their exceptional
performance techniques, the
troupe’s diction, structure, and sub-
ject matter were a hit with the audi-
ence. The poets used vernacule~
language, including slang and ob-
scenities, to create long narratives
that frequently employed the use of
catalogues.

Almost ballad-like, their use of
repeated lines lent power and form
to the pieces. Using their work as a
vehicle for social commentary, the

poems spoke about the issues of
racism, sexism, violence and eco-
nomic inequality by describing
sleazy clubs, hostile city streets,
“f—ed up” love triangles, and ob-
noxious yuppies.

After two hours had mysteri-
ously disappeared, the poets con-
cluded the night with a poem dedi-

cated to people who are afraid of
sharing their inner selves with oth-
ers for fear of being misunderstood.

“If they don’t get it, it’s all
right,” XYZ and Bartlett chanted.
“Don’t be scared of what’s inside,”
sang out Barlett, and XYZ re-
sponded, “Don’t be afraid to blow
your own mind.”

Through“partnerships” within
the Davidson community, the Ada
Jenkins Center is being renovated
to create, in the words of its execu-
tive director Bonnie Brown, what
should be a “safe, welcoming, use-
ful, and fun” community center.
Situated in the northern part of
Mecklenburg County, the town of
Davidson is somewhat isolated
from many governmental services
such as health care, social services
and job skills training. - Ideally,
the Ada Jenkins Center would
house many such programs.

A “Life Skills Room” will of-
fer information and training in ar-
eas such as job hunting, home fi-
nances, high school equivalency
programs, and computer training.
Three major nutrition programs
will share the “Nutrition Coalition
Center”: Loaves and Fishes, which
provides crisis food assistance to
families and pregnant women in
need; N.C. Harvest, which distrib-
utes a variety of surplus foods; and
the Friendship Trays, which deliv-
ers meals for the homebound on
special diets.

A “Social Service Center” will
host a variety of health and social
services programs. A community
mediation program will train me-
diators to help resolve minor dis-
putes peacefully through dialogue.

In addition to
these practical and

dren: “Music and art
teachers are needed to offer ser-
vices.

These resources will be made
available to individuals for either a
nominal fee or through a “sweat
equity plan,” in which one can do-
nate time to the Center in return for
services: “This allows individuals
to think in terms of contributions
rather than need,” explained Brown.

In order for the Ada Jenkins
Center project to continue its suc-
cess, Brown observes it “has to be
community driven.”

As such an integral part of this
community, Davidson College stu-

dents, faculty, and staff are en-
couraged to think about what skills
and interests they can add to the
progress being made.

Presently, volunteers are
needed to help with renovations
Saturday mornings from 9 a.m. -
noon. An afterschool tutoring
program is also in need of volun-
teers every weekday afternoon.

Those interested should con-
tact YuJay Harris (6175) or Latasha
High. Anyone with general ques-
tions about volunteering can call
the Service Coordinator, Catherine
Turner at 892-2460.
