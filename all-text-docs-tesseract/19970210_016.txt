Baseball brings big batsmen, renewed vigor into season

Staff Writer

On Wednesday, the baseball
team will open its 1997 campaign
against South Carolina, a team con-
. Sistently among the nation’s elite.

The challenging debut will be
an indication of what’s ahead for
: the Wildcats,
who face an ex-

lon our non-con-
ference schedule
is bad,” said sev-
enth-year head
" coach Dick Cooke in a recent inter-
view. ‘
Davidson faces three ACC
schools - Wake Forest, Duke and
N.C. State - and two SEC schools -
' Auburn and South Carolina - in
non-league play. And once they
enter conference play, things won’t
get any easier.

“The expectation of our con-
ference is that we can get a team to
the College World Series,” said
Cooke.

Georgia Southern was ranked

Cooke

as high as tenth in the country last
season and again stands as confer-
ence favorite. The other traditional
power teams within the league will
also reload.

“Western Carolina has every-
one ‘back and The Citadel will be
strong again,” added Cooke. But
his year’s team can only benefit
from such rigorous competition.

On the field, Davidson looks to
improve upon last year. Unlike the
rest of its'conference opponents and
most of the teams on their schedule,
the squad is non-funded.

Therefore, it is a tribute to the
team that the Wildcats are even
competitive, let alone entirely ca-
pable of knocking, off Duke and
Wake Forest, something it did last
season.

“Our offense is going to be
awesome this year,” said junior
Luke Goodwin. Indeed. The
Wildcats return senior captain Gus
Quattlebaum and veterans Brad
Edwards and Anderson Marvin, all
of whom should be major threats at
the plate.

Quattlebaum, who played in
the prestitgious Cape Cod (Mass.)
League last summer, will benefit

from moving back to right field
after playing at
third last sea-
son.

The addi-
tion of several
new faces tothe
squad has al-
lowed many
players tomove Q
back to their {debanm
natural positions. Goodwin will
also move from right to center field
where he says he is much more
comfortable.

The offense is not the only rea-
son for the excitement.

“We have a lot of team speed,”
said Quattlebaum. “And we are
also going to be solid defensively.”

The exciting new rookie middle
infield of shortstop Ben Brown and
second baseman Drew Williams has
looked excellent in the pre-season.

“Drew is better defensively
than guys I’ve seen at Wake,” re-
marked Goodwin, who began his
college career as'a Demon Deacon.

With most of the parts in place,
the key to the season will undoubt-
edly be the pitching. The staff will

be anchored by veterans Mordecai ~

Stolk and John Coulombe with the
other starting slots up for grabs.

“We’ll see how we can utilize
people in certain roles,” remarked
Cooke.

Not only is it going to be im-
portant to find a starting rotation,
but also to keep it healthy.

“If the pitching stays healthy,
we’re gonna be good,” added
Goodwin.

The off-season clearly revealed
this team’s commitment to
Davidson baseball. The Wildcats
trained extensively this fall, includ-
ing 6 a.m. workouts.

“I don’t think any other school
in the nation had 6 a.m. workouts,”
said Quattlebaum. “We know we
can compete and be a good baseball
team.”

Despite the non-conference
gauntlet and pitching concerns, this
team clearly boasts potential. “It’s
a legitimate goal to finish .500,”
said Goodwin.

The Wildcats play their home
opener Saturday with a double-
header against Va. Commonwealth,
a 38-game winner last season. The
first game begins at noon.

Heading into the Southern
States meet at Cannon pool this
Thursday through Saturday, the
men’s and women’s swimming and
diving teams both have confidence
that they can bring a championship
to Davidson.

“In the beginning of the year
we hung a list in the locker room
that said beat Charleston, beat Duke,
win Southern States,” Mike
McCabe said about the men’s team.
“We’ vealready checked off the first
two, and the last thing we have to
check off is Southern States.

“‘We’ ve been preparing for this
all year. We beat Georgia Southern
in our dual meet, and they were our
main competition last year (the
Eagles won Southern States,
Davidson finished third). We’ve
accomplished everything we’ve
wanted to all year, and I don’t see
how we won’t overcome this
hurdle.”

After Saturday’s practice, head
coach Rich DeSelm told his team
that they needed to focus on win-
ning each of the six sessions of the
meet. ;
- According to DeSelm, the
psych sheets (seedings for each

event based on this year’s times)
showed that both Davidson teams
could be fighting for the Southern
States crown. The men have won
the title once (1995), but the women
have never finished higher than
fourth (1996).

“If we perform to the level of
our abilities then we shouldbe fight-
ing for the crown,” DeSelm said.

Hart and Soul

Diver Michael Hart has been
a clutch performer for the men’s
team in his final season. He is third
in points on the team (125) behind
Scott Harper (155.25) and Freddy
Schnell (135.5), but that is more
impressive

against East Carolina on Dec. 7
(first - 1m, second - 3m) and UNC-
W on Jan. 18 (second on both
boards). In 1995, he won the 1m
crown at Southern States, but he has
never pulled off a Southern States
double.

“T’d like to have one of my best
meets. That would be anice topping
to my career,” Hart said. “I’ve also
got some more technical goals. I
want to break 400 points on the 3m,
and I'd like to win both boards.

“My dives are not coming to-
gether quite as well as I’d like them
to be. I’m hoping that everything is
going to come together on Thurs-
day and Friday. It’s just a matter of
relaxing and having fun.”

DeSelm to manage Pan-
Pacific games

DeSelm has been selected as
head manager of the United States
team for the seventh Pan-Pacific
games in Fukuoka, Japan this sum-
mer.

The competition will last four
days, but, with a two- to three-day
training camp, getting settled in Ja-
pan, and actually traveling to and
from Fukuoka, DeSelm’s responsi-
bilities will span a two-week pe-
riod.

“My job is to make sure that

everything is pulled off fairly and
equally with
the athletes
foremost in
mind,”
‘DeSelm” said.
1 “We want as
‘| few wrinkles
as possible.”

DeSelm was
selected from
the manager’s
trip list (a group of potential man-
agers) by United States Swimming
(USS). The team itself will be cho-
sen based on performances at the
Phillips 66 Summer National Swim-
ming Championships in Nashville,
Tenn., from July 26 - Aug. 1.
Twenty-six men and 26 women
will make the team, along with four,

two men and two women, open -

water athletes (10 km swim or fur-
ther) and 17 staff people. DeSelm
will have two assistants.

“It will be fun hard work,”
DeSelm said. “It takes away from
my job and my family. But I asked
(Athletic Director) Jim Murphy
for permission in case I was chosen,
andI was selected. It’s a great honor.
I will get to see some of the best
switnming in the world.”

Pacific rim countries will com-
pete in the games, including swim-

ming powers New Zealand, Japan,
and possibly China.

Super-crazy swim fans

The teams’ success has at-
tracted such a following this sea-
son, that fans have started doing
something they’ve never done be-
fore - travel.

In their meet at Duke on Feb. 1,
the swimmers emerged from the
lockerroom to see raucous superfans
Charlie McLaughlin, Will
Hudson, Jason Lina, and Chad
Foster cheering.

“Tt was pretty fun because they
(the swimmers) had noidea we were
coming,” McLaughlin said. “When
we .walked in, they got pretty
pumped, and we were screaming
and yelling and acting like idiots.

“It was fun because there
weren’t that many Duke fans there
and we made our presence known.
We hada good time doing it, and we
think they appreciated it.”

The swimmers certainly did.
Schnell said their presence changed
the feeling of the meet.

“It was nice to see more
Davidson fans than Duke fans
there,” he said. “We have swum
well at home all season, and it was
like a home atmosphere with them
there.”

Rugby falls to UNC Chapel Hill in short-handed opener

By Wit BALDWIN
Staff Writer

In the cold and muck of the
Mooresville First Baptist Church
field, the rugby team’s season got
off to an inauspicious start with a
36-7 trouncing at the hands of UNC
Chapel Hill.

Forced off their home field, the
Wildcats looked uncomfortable and
outmanned. Several turnovers and
poor tackling led to four first-half

Tarheel scores.

“We had several good oppor-
tunities in the first half and could
not manage to convert them, and
then I think their strength and tech-
nique took over the game,” said
coach Blaine Segal.

In the second half, Davidson
came out with a new found inten-
sity and limited the bigger and faster
Tarheels to two scores.

Midway through the second
half, Davidson pushed the ball

downfield on a series of nice back
runs and forward rucks.

Then captain Thayer Long
scooped the ball up and touched the
ball down for Davidson’s lone score.
Matt Burkhardt converted the kick
after.

“Tt would have been really easy
for these guys to just roll over and
give up after all we had been
through,” said Long. “But they
showed a great deal of heart in the
second half and that means a lot.”
