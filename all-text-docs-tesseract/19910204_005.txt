Let's Get Our
Symbols Straight

Symbols surround us. They
testify to our beliefs, they signify
our commitment to those beliefs,
and they inform others of our posi-
tions and preferences. However,
as Derrick Willard thoughtfully

It is a tribute to this nation’s
commitment to the principle of
freedom that we may choose. Like
Mr. Willard, I do not wish to in-
fringe upon that right, nor will I
“deny anyone’s right to do as he

But given
that both

always, as
Mr. Wil-

elucidated in last week’s issue of
The Davidsonian, symbols can
mean different things to different
people. Precisely for this reason
we should take care in how we
display our symbols or undertake
symbolic acts, but we should not,
as Derrick suggests, shelve the
symbol. Rather we should strive to
clarify what meaning we wish to
convey in the symbols we employ.

In his article Derrick refers to

lard says,
“consider
the statement [we] make” when
displaying symbols.

The answer then lies not in
“shelving” the symbol, but rather
in clarifying its meaning. Obvi-
ously, a Confederate flag, when
flown alongside an American one,
cannot truly stand for a Confeder-
ate nation. Rather, the more likely
meaning is that it symbolizes a
region, the South, which has shared
a unique history, and considers

the Confederate flag in particular.
“What is seen as a proud relic to
many Southeners, the Confederate
flag, isa symbol of oppression and
hatred tomany others,” he reminds
us. Yet, we mustacknowledge that
such conflicting perceptions occur
with the American flag as well. As
all of us are but too aware, our
American flag evokes both pride
and scorn here at home. While
some salute it, others burn it, and
still others may do neither.

Foundation For The New World

By Chris Einolf '91

As a war begins in the Middle
East ourcountry faces the certainty
ofcasualties numbering in the thou-
sands, and of expenses in the bil-
lions. While Saddam Hussein’s
actions should definitely be op-
posed, it is unclear whether our
interest in the region merits such a
strong response. President Bush
contends that these sacrifices are
justified because they will bring
results both in the Middle East and
throughout the world; the war will
usher in a New World Order, in
‘which peace and justice will reign
worldwide.

This argument rests on some
dubious assumptions. Bush feels
that with the end of the cold war,
the major cause of world conflict

has disappeared. The world com-

munity agrees on what constitutes

itself in some ways distinct from
the rest of the country to which it
holds ultimate loyalty. Some indi-
viduals feel this distinctiveness of
greater personal pertinence than
do others. I would encourage those
who do feel this need to display the

ajustconflict, and the United States
will lead the world in judging and
prosecuting aggression. The ex-
ample of Iraq will convince other
nations to solve their problems
peacefully, and avoid war.

Any person who is well-in-
formed about the international
politics of this century can see that
the New World Order will never
come about. The roots of world
conflicts go much deeper than the
struggle of the superpowers, and

will continue even now that the |

cold war has ended. The world
community often disagrees on
which conflicts are just, and the
United States often finds itself op-
posed to the decisions of the United
Nations. Making an example of
Iraq will do nothing. to solve the
fundamental causes of conflict in
the Middle East, and will not solve

Why I Do Not Support The War

By Doug Gibson ' 91

The most common topic of
debate in the Davidsonian over the
past few weeks has been the issue
of protest. Those who support this
war insist that its opponents si-
lence their protests in order not to
hurt the war effort. We must stand
behind the world’s forces, they say,
or else we risk their lives and the
stability of the region by lengthen-
ing this conflict; we must resolve
to punish Saddam Hussein, or else
we may have to face his threat
again.

Perhaps. But when I hear these
arguments, I think about Henry
David Thoreau’s essay, “Civil
Disobedience,” in which Thoreau
asks, “How can a man be satisfied
to maintain an opinion merely, and
enjoy it? Action from principle --
the perception and performance of
right -- changes things and rela-
tions; it is essentially revolution-
ary.”

Those who criticize peace
advocates want them to divorce
their ideals from their lives now
that the war has started, but how
can anyone ask this? The idea is
absurd. Those who opposed this
war before it began can do nothing
but oppose it more stridently now
that it has commenced the very
evils they feared all along. If they
did anything else, they would give
up their rights as citizens and --
worse -- their responsibilities as
human beings.

That said, why do! oppose this
war? I have several objections
both to: George Bush’s methods
and reasoning as he led our nation
and our world into this conflict.
First, I feel we cannot afford it.
Ten years of irresponsibility have
made a shambles of efforts to help
our nation’s poor: now, despite
concems over how our economy
will compete in the world for the
next decades, George Bush has
shouldered the responsibility to

‘forge a “new world order.” How

will an nation which has spent so
much on defense and has then ex-
pended its force in the desert pro-
vide the economic clout necessary
to maintain this order? I do not
know. Foradecade now the United
States has ignored the widening
cracks in its economy and yet after

the fundamental causes of conflict
elsewhere in the world.

The conflict in the Middle East
has been going on for centuries;
the end of thecold war will dolittle

- to resolve it. Defeating Iraq will

do nothing to address the region’s
fundamental problems; in fact, past
experience has shown that conflict
only exacerbates tensions. Israel
has fought four wars since its for-
mation as a state forty years ago,
yet the issues that caused these
wars remain completely unsolved.

Likewise, making an example
of Hussein will do nothing to settle
conflicts elsewhere in the world.
The headlines may be about the
Middle East, but violence and
oppression continue elsewhere. A
civil war in Liberia leaves thou-
sands dead, yet the United States,
despite its long history of interven-

this year the money to patch them
will be scarce indeed.

I also oppose Bush’s current
diplomatic policy in the Middle
East because it is sowing the seeds
for future problems. Already we
are destroying a military we built
up in order to provide the region
with stability. For as Iraq weakens
we assist other countries indirectly:
Iran, with its claims on Islamic

thinks this conflict will, like World
War II, require an allied military
presence twenty years after its
conclusion? If so, then who will
pay for such a presence, and who
will supply the troops for it? Ifnot,
then does that mean Bush will tol-
erate Hussein’s survival or the
survival of the Baathists who sup-
porthim? Also, does the fact that
he opposed Iraq’s attempt to link

The main thing we should learn from the ori-
gins of World War II is this: that no peace with-
out the consent of the governed will last.

fundamentalists, will now become
a stronger power. We have also
begun to support another dictator
and sponsor of terrorism: Hafez-
Assad of Syria has opposed us in
Lebanon for many years now, and
he will undoubtedly seize
Hussein’s defeat as an opportunity
to take the lead among militant
Arab nationalists. We have had to
confront both nations in the past,
and if we eliminate Iraq as a con-
tender for the leadership of the
Arab world, we will only find them
stronger opponents in the future.

_ Inaddition to fostering stronger
opponents in Syria and Iran, the
destruction of Hussein for which
Bush hopes can only create an-
other martyr for the Arab world.
Right now, his defiance has given
him many supporters, and his death
at the hands of the United Nations
forces will increase those support-
ers.and perhaps destabilize North-
ern Africa, Jordan, and other coun-
tries in the reqion. His martyrdom
might, in the long run, even desta-
bilize a “liberated” Kuwait, once
the West restores the monarchy
there.

Nevertheless, Bush has insisted
so strongly upon Hussein’s destruc-
tion that one wonders if he now
fears his loss of face should the war
have any other conclusion.

This brings me to the third
reason I oppose the war: the ad-
ministration’s short-sightedness as
itplans for what will happen after-
ward. Bush has compared Hussein
with Hitler, but does that mean he

withdrawal from Kuwait with a
conference on the Palestinian ques-
tion mean that he opposes such a
conference? If not, then why didn’t
he say he supported the idea? If he
would have supported such a con-
ference, will he still support one
now that we owe Israel so much for
its restraint? We must wonder
what will happen after thisconflict
ends, and yet Bush has supplied
only vague answers. In planning
for battle, Bush has so far failed to
producea vision of the peace which
will follow.

This failure to plan for peace
leads me to my fourth and main
reason for opposing our involve-
ment in the conflict. The most
common reason Bush cites for
confronting Saddam Hussein has
been containment, and he uses the
example of World War II to prove
that weare currently fighting a war
for peace, so to speak. Democrats
and Republicans, Liberals and
Conservatives, diplomats and
warriors all agree that just as we
should have contained Hitler be-
fore he attempted to subjugate
Europe, we should now contain
and even destroy Hussein before
heattempts tosubjugate the Middle
East. Not only do I disagree with
this comparison, I feel it is danger-
ously misguided, as itignores other
lessons we should learn from the
events of 1939.

The main thing we should leam
from the origins of World War Il is

tion in Liberian politics, has not
lifted a finger to help. Soviet forces,
with Gorbachev’s approval, vio-
lently suppress the Baltic repub-
lics, yet we refuse to even recog-
nize the Baltic states’ right to self-
determination. In China, four lead-
ers of the Tiananmen square dem-
onstrations go on trial; observers
consider the trials to be test cases
to measure Western response.
That we are so willing to go to
war where oil is concerned, yet so
reluctant to act where we have
nothing 'to gain, points out the
hypocrisy of Bush’s claim that

-moral considerations motivated

this war with Iraq. Furthermore,
the war limits our ability to influ-
ence other countries through eco-
nomic and diplomatic pressure.
How can President Bush condemn
China and the Soviet Union for

their actions, when he needs their
support for his policies in the
Middle East?

Thus we can see that winning a
war against Iraq will do little to
establish a New World Order, and
may actually set back oureffortsto
doso. Yeteven if this New World
Order were possible, what would
qualify the United States to en-
force it? - -

Bush portrays the United States
as the strong arm of the U.N., asthe
leader in enforcing what the inter-
national community agrees is right.
In this particular case, Bush’s por-
trayal is accurate. In the past,
however, the United States has
often found itself opposed to a
unanimous world opinion.

In the years 1981-1986, the
