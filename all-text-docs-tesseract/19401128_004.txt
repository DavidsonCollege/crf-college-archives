Hank Bahnson, center and tackle—a mere strip of a
lad weighing only around 160 pounds, was Hank when
he first walked under the hallowed oaks of Davidson.

Hard work bore results, however, and the battle-scarred

youth from Winston-Salem,

now balances the leads at

180. With this physical growth has also come a fighting
spirit, which makes Bahnson a savage tackler and fierce

blocker. Long will we remember the scrappy play of
“Beacon” here at Davidson.

the headlines and the delighted squeals of feminine fans,
but the kind that people who really know the game ap-

preciate.

Jay is a player, as the saying goés.

Backing

up the line, blocking for others to run, battering through
the center of the line are not spectacular tasks, but ones
that must be performed. To Jay, because he performed

these tasks and performed them well,

goes our vote as

the backbone of the team of 1940.
