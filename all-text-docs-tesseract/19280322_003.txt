exclaimed his father. ‘How is it
that young Jones is always at the

he said'‘kindly, “that Jones has aw-

1928 Track Season
Has Bright Outlook

With the first meet of the 1928 track sea-
son. only two weeks off, elimination time
trials will be held for candidates the latter
part of this week. At the present time, there
are 70 men out. This is only a small num-
ber, according to Coach Tilson, considering
the number of men who are not participating |
in any kind of sports at this time of Rl
and anyone who has any ability in running, |
weights and especially the broad and high |
jumps, is urged to come out.

The outlook for the team this year with |
Captain John Currie back, leading in the 100
and the 220 yard dashes, is fairly bright. The
field events have an especially bright pros-
pect for good showing.

Besides Captain Currie, the men showing
up best in the 220 are Kell and Flynn, both
from last year’s squad. In the 440, Kell,
Brohard, Johnnie Melton, and Buck Jennings
seem to be the most favored candidates
among the upperclassmen. In the hurdles,
Creech, Craig Frye, Melton, Brown, and
Whittle are the mainstays. The weights,
shot put and discus will be held by Leftwich,
Regen, Carson and King.

The schedule for this year, as it now
stands, includes six meets, two of which are
to be held here. The track schedule is:

March 31—State at Davidson.

April 4—Duke at Duke.

April 14—Tech Relays, Ga. Tech.

April 2i—Wake Forest at Wake Forest.

April 28—University of S. C. at Davidson.

May 4, 5—State Meet at Greensboro.

RE-EXAMS

In a previous issue of The David-
sonian a mistake was made in the re-
examinations schedule. The re-exami-
nations will take place on Thursday,
April 5th, at 2:30 p. m.

All students, excepting the Seniors,
will be allowed only one re-examina-
tion. Only by a special permission
from the dean can a student take more
than one re-exam. Those who desire
to take the examinations must pay a
fee of $2.50 and\ maké arrangements
with Mr. Hengeveld and the professor

' in whose course they failed; this must
be done as soon as possible.
