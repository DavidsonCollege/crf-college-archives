Last Saturday marked the end
of the 1994 college football regu-
lar season. Once again, sports fans
can look forward to the holiday
season for the always entertaining
and time consuming bowl games.
Ever since Georgia Tech and Colo-
rado shared the national title four
years ago, there has been an ongo-
ing controversy concerning how to
determine a clear cut champion.

This year is no different than the

past. Two teams remain unde-
feated, ranked number | and 2 re-
spectively, but will not face each
other in the postseason. Penn State
and Nebraska have gone through
their respective schedules with out
a loss or tie.

The Nittany Lions were ranked
first at one time this season, but
lost thier seat on the throne be-
cause Indiana score two late touch-
downs to make a blowout look
seemingly close. Nebraska de-
feated Colorado soundly and hash’t
looked back since. I think what
hapened last year will happen this
year. The best team in college foot-
ball will not get the national cham-
pionship. Notre Dame was the best
team last year, and Penn State is
the best team this year. But the
media holds the fate, and when it
comes down to it, they will favor
poor old Tom Osborne over Bobby
Bowden.

There are 18 bowl games on
tap this Holiday season, and only
two of them involve any sort of
title hopes, so let’s look at some
others. For what it is worth, here’s
what I think will happen, but don’t
be so quick to run to your bookee
these predictions:

Aloha Bowl
Kansas State vs. Boston College
Senior Chad May will wrap up his

brilliant college career with a trip:

to the island state. The Wildcats
have had a strong year, with losses
to the #1 and #5 teams in the coun-
try. They deserve to be in a bowl
with a higher profile, but they will
enjoy roughing up Boston College

for their first 10 win season in my »

memory. They have an explosive
offense with a defense the Eagles
will have trouble moving the ball
against. Boston College will bring
a well coached squad that should
keep the score tight for most of the
game, but not at the end. Kansas
State by 10.

Gator Bowl

Tennessee vs. Virginia Tech

This very well could be one of the
better games during the post-sea-
son. The Volunteers are on a roll
and freshman Peyton Manning
seems to look better and better
each game. The Hokies started
strong, but ended their season in a
tailspin and might not be able to
recover. I like Tennessee in this
one, but it will be a close one and
could go either way, In a game
with a lot of scoring, the Vols by 3.
Holiday Bowl

Colorado St. vs Michigan

Like Utah, Colorado State has been
a pleasant surprise and the main
reason the WAC has had such a
successful season. Michigan has
sputtered once under head coach
Gary Moeller for the second sea-

son in a row, but they have too
much pride to be humiliated once
again. I think Michigan and run-
ning back Tyrone Wheatley can
salvage a difficult season with sea-
son ending victory in the Holiday
Bowl. Take the Woverines and
their running game with a 10 point
victory.

Sun Bowl

Texas vs. North Carolina

Who knows what this game will be
like. If the Tarheels play solid,
they will win. The Longhorns still
haven’t recovered from the disas-
ter in the Cotton Bowl four years
ago and this game probably won’t
help the program too much. North
Carolina hasn’t exactly had all cyl-
inders running too smoothly this
season either, but they want to
avenge last season’s embarrass-
mentin the Gator bowl. I'll go with
the Tarheels by 13.

Peach Bowl

N.C,State vs. Mississippi State
Traditionally a good game, the past
seven have been won late in the
fourth quarter by less than a touch-
down. This year should not fail
with these two squads. Both ended
up strong, especially the Wolfpack
with their surprising win over Vir-
ginia. Mississippi State is a better
team than most people know, with
all three losses coming to top 10
teams. The Pack will keep it tight,
but the Bulldogs will be too much.
Mississippi State by 4.

Orange Bowl

Nebraska vs. Miami

One of the two bowl games that
will play an infuencial role on the
national championship picture. For
Nebraska, a win over Miami in
their back yard will essentially
guarantee Tom Osborne his first

.title. But doing this is something

they have been unble to accom-
plish. Last year, the Cornhuskers
got alevel of respect for their gutty
performance against Florida State.
Unfortunately, I don’t think they
will be able to pull of the victory
over the Hurricanes. The frustra-
tion continues. Miami by 7.

Hall of Fame Bowl

Wisconsin vs. Duke

The Blue Devils had an incredible
season, losing their last two games
by only one point each. Fred Gold-
smith knows how to prepare his
team and the Blue Devils will find
a way to win this one. Wisconsin
has been quite inconsistent after
last year’s dream season, and get-
ting up for this bowl is different
from the Rose Bowl. Duke by 9.
Citrus Bowl

Alabama vs. Ohio State

The Tide lost any hope for a na-
tional championship after losing to
Florida, but that won’t stop them
against the Buckeyes. Beating
Michigan saved John Copper’s job,
but the fans will be grumbling once

again after faltering in their bowl
game. It will be close, because
Alabama doesn’t know any other
way to play a football game, but
the Tide will prevail in teh end.
Alabama by 4.

Fiesta Bowl

Colorado vs. Notre Dame

Brace yourself, because this might
get ugly. Rashad Salaam and his
teamamtes will serve up a big win
for the outgoing head coach Bill
McCartney. Don’t expect the 10-9
thriller these two had in the Orange
Bowl in 1990. Notre Dame might
score only 9 points, but Colorado
won’t. Colorado by 21, at least.
Carquest Bowl

South Carolina vs. West Virginia
The Orange Bowl is the night be-
fore, but this one’s not going to be
quite the same. First year head
coach Brad Scott will try to what
no coach has been able to at South
Carolina, win a bowl game. The
Gamecocks have a good chance to
break the jinx against the Moun-
taineers. West Virginia ended the
season strong, but should have
trouble in the Florida heat. I think
coaching will be the difference, so
I'll go with the Gamecocks. South
Carolina by 6.

Cotton Bowl

Texas Tech vs. Southern Cal

All eyes will not be on this one. To
realize just how bad the final year
of the Southwest Conference has
been, four teams finshed in a tie for
first place with 4-3 records, and
Texas Tech came outof top. Thank
goodness there won’t be another

. year like this. John Robinson will

say he won the Cotton Bowl as
Southern Cal’s head coach, but it
will take at leat ten years before
that means anything. Another po-
tential blowout. Southern cal by
17.

Rose Bowl

Penn State vs. Oregon

Who would of thought that Or-
egon would have won the PAC-
10? Not many and if they did, they
go to the school. They have had a
good season, but their magic car-
pet ride will lose all air against the
Nittany Lions. Penn State is the
best team in college football with
an offense that makes some NFL
teams drool. Penn State will know
its fate when they step on the field,
but they will take care of business
just the same. Just like shooting
Ducks off a pond, Penn State by
14.

Sugar Bowl

Florida vs. Florida State

These teams played toa tie just two
weeks ago, so we have a meaning-
less rematch. If Alabama had won,
this game takes on a whole new
look, but they didn’t, so now we
are stuck. Please boycott this game.
I hope they tie again, but Florida
will prevail. Gators by 3.

ning marginthe team has ever had.
‘Davidson shot 43 percent from

the Ccats were scheduled to face
UNCG in a consolation game at on
