Time For Pros

Most Davidson students seem to be
tired of serving as the panel in a sort
of Social Council Amateur Hour,

which no one wins.

For this reason, and because of our
own indifference to the lineup of
concerts slated for this school year,
we offer some workable alternative A
suggestions regarding the present so-

cial set-up.

It is conceivable that Davidson has
nationally-known
entertainment; but no one seems to
be doing anything more than griping
about it, and in the meantime, some
money
spent annually on entertainment that
fails to raise more than a couple of

problems booking

$23,000 of student

eyebrows.

The Council has noted that large

it’s kerleafing time.

What is kerleafing? It is an activi-
ty requiring only a capacity for am-
bulation (walking around)
abundance of leaves to ambulate on.
There are no rules, no time limita-
gth of Fall),
no ‘points, no competition, and no
opposition. Kerleafing is simply an
experience of pure and positive de-

tions (other than the J

light and gaiety. ,~ :

If humanities, \unified sciente or
life in general gat you depressed, for-
sake the dull, paved’‘walks for the
joys of kerleafing. The sensual swish-

ing and crunching of the _ leaves
soothes the soul and makes merry

the heart.

Kerleafing

Kerleafing season is upon us again.
For the uninitiated, let us explain.

About once each year—usually fol
lowing summer and preceding win-
ter—the local foilage drops its mono-
tone green for a melodious harmony
of golds, yellows, reds, and assorted
other hues. After each leaf has sung
its part, it. wafts its merry way to the
ground. Time passes and, when. a
multitude-of leaves have descended,

in

groups charge considerably and that
to book a bigtime group could well
deplete the social allotment. But they

fail to note that* block-booking with

area schools reduces the cost consid-
erably. The Council could have pur-
sued that course.

number
that one big name per year woultl

of students have said

make the “unknown” concerts more

is being

bearable; in that suggestion lies an-
other alternative. a
The social fee as it now stands is’
inadequate; but most students" seem
to indicate that they would not mind
paying more for better entertainment.
This can be accomplished in two ways:
either by a door charge, or by raising

the social fee.

Of these two, probably the door
charge is the better solution. Well-
known groups, such as Davidson se-
cured until last year, will draw well,

in spite of the price of tickets. If the

entertainment is, good, students will
be willing to pay.

It'is a wallet-saving tradition toybe
able to gain admission by the flip of
a Davidson I.D., but the practice loses
its beauty when one finds himself con
tinually disappointed by the act on
the other side of the door.

The performance last weekend was
good, but the act was extremely am-
ateurish in its lack of color, dialogue

and polish. The union provides good

and an

bands for dances, for “considerably
less; one expects a concert in the full
sense of the word from the Social
Council performers.
Council Chairman Bill Traxler is
“ certainly correct in his statement that
the council will be unable to please
all the people all the time; but at the
same time it is important to note that
it is his job to please most of the
- people, and most students are current-
ly dissatisfied.

We feel that most students would
be willing to cooperate with whatever
alternative social programs the coun-
cil comes up with, but it seems clear

that some change is needed.

To the Editor:

Hi, Ed. I've been wonder-

the college production of
“Don't: Drink the Water" a
couple of weeks ago. What'd
you think? Like it?

Seriously — I know THE
DAVIDSONIAN runs short of

what to write about and what
to forget .. . And I realize
that neglection probably tops
the list of your all-time fa-
vorite reader gripes.

So Ed., in lieu of some
kind of coverage, maybe
you'll consent to running my
own . personal one-sentence

However, the main em-
phasis of the report seems
to be an attempt to ration:
alize the coHege’s failure by
condemning .the fraternities.

Instead of thanking the
fraternities for providing the
social outlets which. the col-
lege has failed to provide,
this obviously biased com-
mission condemns them for
not providing to all what the
college has failed to provide
to any.

But how has the commis
sion proposed to correct the
failures of the college?

(1) Recognizing the separ-
atism created by fraterni-

“poses to reestablish a total

separatism in. housing, eat-
ing, and partying through
their Superdorm, concept.

(2) Instead of providing
the viable alternative which
the college has failed to pro-
vide, the commission recom-
mends an underhanded des-
truction of the option that
now exists for most of the
students, in favor of » requir-
ed group eating, partying,
and living based on selec-
tion (Selection?) by an im-
personalized computer meth-
od. (This might be as effec-
tive as computerized mixer

This Superdorm.: concept
represents not only a destruc-
tion of students’ option, byt
destruction of their individ-
ualism in an attempt to pro-
vide greater control over a
student's activities and goals.
“Residence hall loyalties |

Church Relations

To the Editor:

Two weeks ago THE DA-
VIDSONIAN printed an edi-
torial concerning the Spencer
Commission on Church Re-
lationship. I offer the fol-
lowing points in an effort
to correct the inaccuracies
of the editorial.

1. I do not feel that our re-
port was apologetic (in the
sense of expressing regret
for something in the past).

We explored the past in
order to understand the pre-
sent. It is important that one
distinguish between this ex-
ploration of the past .and
our recommendations for
the future.

The editors obyiously fail-
ed to do this.

There seemed
to. be. a prevalent feeling
within the college commun-

ity la&t year that there were
“just foo many damn minis-
ters on the Board.”

In the ~Com*imission’s at-
tempt to. discover whether
the number of ministers had
anything to do with. the de-
cisions of the Board of
Trustees, the subcommittee
on church relations made an

exhaustive search of the
minutes of most of the
Trustee meetings since the

college's founding.

As could be expected, the
statement about ministers
being détrimental to the
Board proved a classic ex-

ample of rhetorical “over-
kill.”

In our case, the perspec-
tive we gained from our ex-
ploration of the past en-
abled us to be very posi-
tive about our explorations
for the future. To quote the
report:

SOUR PepOle .25 218s
designed to show what we
believe to be _ desirable
means of conserving the
values inherent. in  whole-
some church — college
relations—values that will

be lost if the college separ-
ates from the church-values
that will be jeopardized if
the relationship is less than
wholesome.”

We accepted’ the church
relationship as a working
hypothesis only after length-
y debate, as there were at

least two members of the
commission who felt that
Davidson should not con-
tinue as a _ church-related
school.-

3. Our argument i» the
-continuance of the church

relationship did not rest on
the ‘‘concept of the church's
parenthood over the college
and of the college's grateful
child image.

“One cannot deny the fact
that until, recently, David-
son, as well as most of the

colleges in the U. S., oper
ated under the theory of ‘in
loco parentis.”

But to imply as your edi-
torial does, that our recogn-

_ifion of the fact is the same

as our using this principle
as a basis for our recom-
mendations is a gross mis-
reading of t/:e repor’.

4. There is no su .gestion
anywhere in the
Subcommittee’s

Program
report, that
‘any act of service or good-
will by students shows sup-
port of the church.”

We merély stated that the

local churches and the
Chri$tian_™ organizations._on
campus provide many _ ve-

hicles through which acts of
service may be accomplish-
ed.

Use of these vehicles is not
synonymous to _ support of
the organization which pro-
vides them.

Nor is the subcommittee
vain enough to assume that
Service’ could not .be initiat-
ed by these vehicles.

5. Your statement ‘‘ques-
tionnaires are invalid unless
percentages or numbers re-
sponding are indicated,"’ is
quite true. Unfortunately, it
does not apply to the re-
search of our commission.

6. When the editorial final-
ty gets around to acknow-
ledging the good portions of
our report, it fails to men-
tion our most important
and far-reaching recom-
mendation: the re-shaping of
the Board of Trustees.

\By® implementing this
recommendation Davidson
could take a giant step to-
ward a future of continued
excellence,

7. Finally, it must be men-
tioned that the Commission
Reports were not meant to
be placed against the ideal,
but were meant to be used
as resource materials by Dr.
Spencer, so that he could’
better know how to move
Davidson College into the fu-
ture.

God Bless dou Too, Spiro

Rn 43 3

The purpose of this column is to heap scorn on
the head of likeable, lovable Ted Agnew, a man who
is rapidly becoming a household favorite in American

government and politics.

This is hardly a new idea, as much scorn has
been thrown his way recently, and deservedly so.

Ted, as he was known earlier in his brief politi-
cal career when he was trying to avoid an ethnic
lable, started out in. local politics around Baltimore
with just one campaign slogan: “Téd Agnew — he’s
your kind of man.” Apparently Voters thought this

was true.

By continual. diligent blundering his star has
risen in the Nixon administration, which shows what
sort of benighted heaven it must be.

Spiro Ted has the cardinal virtue of being blunt
and direct, which should be refreshing in-this age
of political doubletalk, but unfortunately he is only
blunt and direct on a few limited subjects, mainly
those he knows nothing about, or those which aren’t
important. Subjects like television-—although he does
have the air of a man who watches a lot of television,
mostly ‘old westerns—and -hippies, ghettoes, etic. He
manages to say next to nothing about national policy,
possibly because he knows next to nothing about it.

He has one function in the administration—ver-

._ bally bludgeoning the opposition. Perhaps worst of all,
many Republicans seem to like him.

Imagine, if you will, that Spiro dutifully serves
Nixon for*éight years, then runs for president on his
own,, and horror of horrors, is elected. Perhaps his
inaugural address would go something like this:

“Eight years ago when I took office as Vice-
President no one would listen to me. I was a voice
crying in the wilderness, spurned by those deluded
minions of the left wing who controlled the media

and the students.

“Yes, there was a left Wing conspiracy against.
me, and against President Nixon. But I am glad to say

we have conquered it.

“Tonight no news casters will carry opposition
to my speech, not any more. Now that the news media
has been brought under control of this great govern-
ment of ours, the liberty of our country is assured.

“And there are no effete hippie protesters mar-
ching out there to oppose us today. Under General
Mitchell our policy of firmness and law and order
has eliminated that menace of the left wing conspiracy.

“Now that J. Edgar Hoover has put some back-
bone in our foreign ‘policy from his post as Secretary
of State, and General Hershey as Commissioner of
Education has knocked some sense into -those kids,
our country is more safe and secure than it has ever

been.

“And having silenced. al] opposition, we now

have a silent’ America.’

EDITED BY Tom WAY AND C.L. CHESHIRE \

To Evaluate Rock Music

By A. D. TRICE -

I sat down and wrote a lit-
tle scholarly deal about the
“criteria for evaluating rock
music, but then I realized
that dead, prose is offensive
to Rock Music in particular,
and generally to’ any art
form, so I tore it up, decid-
ing to_sit down again and
try to express the reasons I
feel Rock music is the most
important artistic experience
of the sixties.

Rock has three elements:
lyrics, music, and perform-
ance, and since I consider
the lyrics the most important
element, I see Rock Music as
a literary movement, revert-
ing back to the Classjcal

‘idea of music and / po-
etry being inseparable.

The music is not as im-
portant because very little

“new ground, except in instru- z

mentation, has been explor-
ed :

Hendrix, for all his insan-
ity, is playing music that is
pre-Mozart in its structure.
Spencer Dryden is about the
only Rock musician I can
-think of who is making mu-
sic that is late Twentieth
Century.

These are exceptions, |!
know, but | dare you to find
, me a tune that is not strictly
diatonic in the whole range
of rock music. (OK, there’s a
raga or two, but not a-far
out raga.)

This is not meant to de-
grade the music. It is to

mean that the music is there ~

for support of the lyrics. A
lot of the success or failure
of a song depends on the fit
of lyrics and words.

Does this imply that Bub-
ble Gum Music is 2 success?

(Both the lyrics and music
are trite and silly.)

No, of course. I could
(maybe) write a perfect nov-
el that would be bad by any
standards except those of
form ‘criticism. But | think
this means that ‘‘The House
at Pooneil Corners’ is bet-

_ ter than “Crystal Blue Per-

suasion.”’

Pooneil is a frightening

sang, both poetically (Somé:,

one stood at a window &
cried/ ‘One tear I thought
that. should stop the war/ but
someone is killing me.) and
the music is loud, irregular,
dissonant.

Talking about Pooneil leads
me to a digression: Aristotle
gave us some criteria for
“judging art; it’s supposed to
heighten emotions (specifi-
cally fear and pity).

Tf it doesn't heighten those
too many people get upset.
But he was talking about
tragic drama.

Why shouldn't Rock Poet-
ry heighten love (or to be
crude, heighten the sexual
drive)? Why shouldn't it
make us hate hatred? Why

_ can't it make us laugh?
‘ Laughter and love seem to
threaten a great number of
people teday.

Well, the plain fact of it is
that rock musie doesn’t give
a damn usually about pleas-
ant) little things that you can
easily forget about when the
record cuts off. It’s art of in-
volvement. It is much more
literal about a purge, be-
cause many 'of its artists
think that people are pretty
full of something.

It is revolutionary — too.
(Tear down the walls, moth-

er +-s, says the Jefferson
Airplane.) It’s created an-
thems and hymns “‘A Day in
the Life,” “Give Peace a
Chance," “We Can “Be To-
gether,’ ‘Volunteers of Am-
erica.')

There are two kinds’ of per-
formers: artists and images.

Laura Nyro and Grace
Slick ‘belong to the first cate-
gory, and Jagger and Morri-
son-belong to the other, and
in groups The Beatles and
the Who belong to the first
and—Phe Mothers and- the
1910. Fruitgum Company to
the second; (I would have
said Fugs, but can I say that
in a paper?)

Like it or not, all of Rock
is influenced by soul. The
Performer gets up and pro-
jects himself, and at its best,
he’s Projecting his own ma-
terial,

Sometimes there is not
much there to project, so he
pulls down: his: pants in pub-
lie and everybody says, OK,
that’s cool, he must be sexy,
and so his music becomes
sexy.

Sometimes there is a lot
there. Grace Slick can en-
tice you, enrage you, scare
you, , because ‘she is sincere.
Judy Collins can sing a song
about her father or her first
love, and you know the way
she must have felt when they
were gone,

Aretha can give you as
many clues about being
black as Cleaver when she
is at her best. (OK, I'm in
dangerous country.)

The performer in Rock is
almost as important as the
material. Nilsson’s songs are
entirely different when some-
one else sings them. (And
what could the CCR do to
‘Hey, Jude’’?)
