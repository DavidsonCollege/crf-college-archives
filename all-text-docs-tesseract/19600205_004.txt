THE DAVIDSONIAN

| THE WHEEL Past Editor Draws

Armfield: He Believed
In Davidson College

“The Wheel” is gone.

Ed Armfield, editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN from
April 1959 until the last of January, graduated at semes-
ter’s end. He’s in Winston-Salem now, training with
Reynolds and Company, stockbrokers—and waiting to
begin graduate study at Harvard Business School.

Editor Armfield guided THE
DAVIDSONIAN through one of
its stormiest periods. In the
face of violent controversy, he
was the spokesman for those
he termed ‘‘the silent -majori-

ty."

He is suspicious of those who
would violate time-tested prac
tice for experimentation. And
his ¢oncern is deep for the fu-
ture of the college where he
will probably send his sons.

Staff, members remember the
editor at. work at the print
shop, putting in type and set-
ting headlines himself when the
gdirig got slow.

He took his stance on a plat-
form of pragmatism and con-
servatism, and he maintained it
despite an unprecedented flood
of “liberal’’ complaint.

They remember the ever-
present cigar (Dutch Masters)
and .spare time gin-rummy

“tt elected, I'll take 8 firm '
games (he was a winner).

stand where necessary,” he
said in his campaign article
last spring. And The Wheel
lived up to his promise.

He was a busy editor. Staff
members cellected stacks. of
memos in the familiar round
scrawl: “Get faaculty opinion
on cuts," or, “Come by my
room tonight—no matter how
late. I'l be up.”

And the visitor to his room
found a clutter of newspapers
and books—Armfield’s working
tools. “Check the WALL
STREET JOURNAL,” he would
tell new staffers, “It's got the!
best news leads of any paper.”

Above his desk he tacked a
feature by Kays Gary of the
CHARLOTTE OBSERVER.
~*Read it,” he told subordinates.
“It’s a masterpiece.” And back
copies of the U. S. NEWS al
WORLD REPORT littered his!

desk. sy

They remember staff meet-
ings, hilarious and disconnect-
ed; and the editor's sharp re-
minder: “Let’s get on the job.
We're stil! hurtin’ for news this
week.”

And now The Wheel is gone.

People don’t ask whether his
shoes can be filled; they know
the answer already.

Ed Armficld was unique.

He studied stacks of news-
papers from other schools.
“Check page two of VIR-
GINIA CAVALIER,” a memo
to s staff member would
read, “Good idea fr- your
page.”

He read voraciously. Some re-
cent spare time material: Wil-
liam Buckley’s UP FROM LIB.
ERALISM, and W. D. Work-
man’s THE CASE FOR THE
SOUTH.

Ed Armfield believed in Dav-
idson. His respect for the Board
of Trustees is deep; he reveres
Grier Martin; his family is
studded with Davidson gradu-
ates—uncles, brothers, cousins.

Dr. Evans was assistant pastor

studied for two years at the

As a college sophomore, you're nearing the mid-point.
Halfway through college—halfway through Army ROTC.
Now you face a major decision: Are the gold bars of a
Second Lieutenant worth two additional years of study
in advanced ROTC?

That question is yours to answer now—before you
register for your junior year. As you explore the facta,
carefully weigh the traditional responsibilities and rewards
of serving as an Army officer... '

1. Traditional responsibitities. To meet the command responai-

bilities of an y officer, you apply the leadership prin-
ciples abeorbed during advanced ROTC training. And your

2. Traditional rewards. In every organization, greater respon-
sibilities mean greater rewards. Thus the traditional respon-
eibilities and prestige of an Army officer are matched by
material advantages. For example, if you plan to marry
soon after graduation—an officer's salary can be a distinct
advantage. A married 2nd Lieutenant earns a minimum of
$3655.68 per month—plus substantial fringe benefits.

Placement Program
Opens For Seniors

The placement office is innovating an experimental
program to help supplement the work of the guidance

department in aiding seniors to choose their occupation.

Representatives from various
companies will come to David-
son for informal meetings with
interested students. These meet-
ings are tentatively scheduled
for four in the afternoon, and
will be quite informal. THE
DAVIDSONIAN will print the
names and dates of the com-
panies to be represented each
week. Students are not required
to sign up for these interviews,
but may be asked to sign an
open book in order to be placed
on a mailing list.

In the meetings, the repre-
sentative will present a five-

Mon. Feb. 8

minute talk on what his com.
pany is looking for and what
it has to offer. The rest of the
time will be a question and an-
swer session and discussion.

C. Shaw Smith stated, “We
think this is a much better way
to work a Careers Day, by hav-
ing it available during the
whole March-May interview sea-
son.”

“We are trying to be helpful
to students who are not ready
for placement,” said Mr. Smith.
He urged that all students, not
just the seniors, take advantage
of this service.
