-Midwinters is here

Midwinters weekend has ar-
rived, filled, as always, with a
variety of events. This year ther
is one change from previous
years. Because of the theme
“Urban Cowboy,”’ the campus-
wide dance will be informal.

The weekend activities begin
Thursday evening at 8 p.m.
with the film Honeysuckle Rose
starring Willie Nelson. At 10
p.m. there will be a disco in the
900 Room. As an alternative to
the disco, a top 40 band, the
Kays, will be at ETC from
9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

Friday’s concert features
Herbie Mann and his Flute and
Percussion Theater. Mann has
established himself as Ameri-
ca’s outstanding jazz flutist and

as an internationally known
concert artist. The performance
is at 8 p.m. in Love auditorium.
Student tickets are $3 in ad-
vance and $5 at the door.

Paula Larke, a black actress
and blues singer, will perform at
9:30 and 11 p.m. in the 900
Room Friday night. A Winston-
Salem native, Larke has a
dynamic voice. Her acting cre-
dits include the national pro-
ductions of for colored girls who
have considered suicide when
the rainbow is enuf, Hair and a
touring company of Two Gentle
men of Verona. Larke’s perfor-
mances are free.

Six hours of non-stop music
are on the bill at the cam-
pus-wide dance Saturday night.

Licad performs Monday

“Here is a major talent, and
this nineteen year old girl will
be no stranger to the concert
halls of the world in the near
future.’’ This is the New York
Times’ opinion of pianist Cecile

ation Gold Medal winner will

perform Monday at 8:15 p.m. in _

Love Auditorium. The concert
is free.

As a winner Licad. received
$10,000, a three year recording
contraet with Columbia Re-
cords, and appearances with the

nation’s leading symphonies,

including the Boston Sympho-
ny, National Symphony, Phila-
delphia Orchestra, and New
York Philharmonic.

Monday’s _ performance
should be a rare opportunity to
hear one of the up-and-coming
greats of the music world.

Two bands will entertain at the
informal dance. Threshold plays
top 40 and Lightnin’ West plays
country rock. Those who feel
daring may ride a mechanical
bull for $1. The dance begins at
