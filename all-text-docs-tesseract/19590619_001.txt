GAMES TOR GCOD-OFS AND GENUISES

Contrary to popular belief, Davidson
College uses its endowment fund, which
is Well over 5,000,000, for things other
than new science halis, library wings,
and dormitories. The studcrt's welfare

is of prime importance to the administration.

This fact is brought home to us, the
chosen few, attending summer school.

Nr. Ce Shav Smith and his staff have
showm this interest by the purchasing
of a multitude of new games.

Listed below are a few of these mental
and physical games which have beer made
available for the student body.

Outside Games: 1) Scoop Ball (know the
vorld over as Hailai) ~ This gime is
played much on the order of hand-ball
except that’a scoop-shaped ‘love is used
and an opponent tekes the place of the
wall.

2) Wiffle Pall ~ This frustrating sport
is played much like baseball except that
the batter is at 2 distinct cisadvantage
because the pitcher is given a ball which
is almost impossible to hit.

3) Thether Ball = This ingenius game is
played by tring to wrap a ball and

string around a pole so that :our
opponent is left with nothing to swing at.

,) Frisbee and Frootball are also offered,
the latter for Dolé's next year hopefuls--=
(Right, Hog?)

If a rainy day should set itself upon
Davidson's fair campus, our athletes may
keep in shape with the following. indoor
sportse

1) A new bouling set which may be set
up in the ball roome
