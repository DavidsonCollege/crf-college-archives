The Upward Look

“Let all bitterness, and
and anger, and clamour, and_ evil
speaking be put away from you,
with all malice, and be ye kind
one to another, tender-hearted, for-
giving each other, even as God for
Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”
So wrote the Apostle Paul in his
letter to the Ephesians, and we as
professing Christians must con-
tinually keep this thought actively
in our hearts and minds if we ex-
pect to find a full and happy life.
By harboring resentments in our
hearts, many of us today are giv-
ing way to one of the most effective
weapons that Evi: has to fight with
—Hate.

It is obvious that to hold resent-
ments in our hearts is to throw a
monkey wrench into the machinery
of our lives, for we were made to

but she met the tragedy with faith,

her husband, although unhurt in the
accident, was wounded deeply in his

he let these resentments. spoil his

'Y Cabinet Provides
Youth Center, Rally

Many Students Lend Their
Time and Talents Willingly

The Davidson Y. M..C. A. Cabi-
net is interested in the welfare of
this community. It has always been
on the alert for an opportunity to
pul“into practice the teachings of
Christ. For this reason, in the or-
ganization of the Y. M. C. A. Cabi-
net, there is a department which is
called Community Work. It has
been the privilege, desire and duty
of the department to seek and pro-

smote projects that are of «benefit

to this community.

Colored Community Center

Among some of the mest recent
projects, there is one which has
had a marked degree of success.
It was felt that a meeting place
for the colored boys and girls of
this community would be of par-
ticular advantage. There were no
facilities available to meet the de-
mands of after-school hours activi-
ties of the children, no facility to
provide wholesome recrea-
tion under capable leadership. i

The Cabinet felt that a recrea-
tion or community center would
solve the problem. Under the aus-
pices of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet,

Committee Formed

second semester came and
goals were set. Instead of
fone student planning all the meet-
ings, a council of four was pro-
vided to plan the programs. This
council consists of Herb Meza in
charge of the part of the program
concerning “Christian Experiences”,
Murphy Williams in charge of
music, Lamar Williamson in charge
of speakers, and Bob Henderson in
charge of prayer and general or-
ganization of the programs. A\l-

presented this semester.

However, the “Fellowship” feels
that its greatest purpose is being
neglected, and that is the encour-
agement toward personal prayer
and Bible study daily for each stu-

dent. New plans are in the mak-
ing for the furtherance of this
purpose,

The “Fellowship” feels that it
lies in Davidson’s hands, not just
to develop successful businessmen,
but to give to the world Christian
leaders who rely upon God and
His Word, and who seek, through
the guidance of the Holy. Spirit,
God's purpose for their lives.

tine Jesus was beginning his work
there, and suppose Jesus had come
to you for advice. He might have
explained the situation to you some-
what like this:

“My intention is to carry out my
Father’s work, which is to launch a

that the

whole world. My time here is very

Kingdom is to inelude

short. I know that already I have

mace enemies; my own family fails
to understand me; my home town
has thrown me out, I have thought
it out. I will not be a miracle
worker first of all; I will not sim-
ply see that people are better fed;
nor will I try to be another Caesar.
But it is growing later every day.
Soon my time here will be over,
and I must see that God’s Kingdom
is well started.”

At this point you might have
nodded your head sagely: “Yes,
yes, all this sounds good and logical.
Of course, you are young and have
plenty of time. But you are only
one person. If you are to start a
Kingdom, don’t you need assist-
ants?”

“That is just it,” Jésus might
have answered. “I do need assist-
ants. I am on the lookout for them
now, men who will understand my
ideas, men who can absorb them
and live by them, men who are
capable of winning others, men of
inflygnce who will be able to carry
on successfully after lam no longer
here.” !

“Very good, a sound plan in-
deed!’ You would have said. “Now
whom do you have in mind?”

“That is just what I came to ask
you,” he might have said, if you
can stertch your imagination so
far.

“H'm ... well... Certainly not

where scholars are plentiful. Go to
Rome, where they understand or-

ganization and propaganda. Go to
Jerusalem at the very least, for
there you will find thegreat Bible
scholars of the world. I will write
to some of my influential friends.”

“No, don’t do that,” the young
Teacher would interpose. “I did
not have in mind anything so elab-
orate as that. I thought I might
pick up some people right here...”

“What? In Caperneum?” you
would roar through your beard.
“You'll never find any one in Caper-
neum worth a shekel! Oh, you
might run across a good Roman
official once ina blue moon, or
maybe a traveling Greek scholar if
you kept watch at the inn~ But

At this point your patience would
blow up... “Nonsense!” you would
shout. “I thought you had more
sense. Docks! Customs office! Do
you mean to tell me_you are think-
ing of picking up common fisher-
men and even tax collectors? You
must be mad. I can predict that
if you persist in any scheme like
that your new movement will. die

from Nazareth, but compared with
the great world—you seem to have

how a man of your caliber could
even think of playing into the hands
of the lowest classes! You are just
putting yourself at the mercy of
the commoh man. If you do that,
the world will! never hear you.”

So you might stalk off, dignity
pricking in every whisker.

And then Jesus might smile. to
himself and turn and go on, down
to the docks, looking for fishermen.
