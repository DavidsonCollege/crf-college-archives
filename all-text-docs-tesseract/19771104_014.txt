Win ends tough season;
Deep South looms ahead

By PERZ

The women’s field hockey
team finished regular season
play Tuesday with a 4-0 win
over Salem Academy.

The game capped off a
tough season, and according
to coach Susie Roberts, ‘‘it
was one of the best team
efforts all year.”

The game’ remained score-
less for a good part of the first
half until Lisa Johnson, com-
ing off an injury-riddled sea-
son, scored her second goal of
the year. Minutes later, she
scored again, this time bang-
ing home a shot from 12 yards
out.

The scoring was completed
in the second half with goals
from co-captain Beth Tanner,
getting her sixth of the year,
and from Lisa Ballantyne.

Last Wednesday, che girls
dropped a tough match to
Appalachian State, 3-0. Later
that same day, they lost an
exhibition game to a visiting
British team 3-1. Tanner
scored the lone goal of the day
for the Wildcats.

This year, the schedule was
increased from six to 12
games, and the 5-7 record
owed to the fact that many
tough teams were added to the
schedule. Duke, UNC, ECU,
and Appalachian State were
among the teams that were
added this year.

“The record is not indicative
of our play. Many games could
have gone either way,’’ said
Tanner as she reflected on the
season.

Roberts was happy with the
pride and team spirit that held
the team together during the

The annual Rea-

November 1

season, which at one point
included a five game losing
streak.

Injuries also plagued the
team this year, with 11 of the
17 players injured at some
point during the season.

This weekend, the team
travels to Greenville, S.C., to
play in the Deep South Tour-
nament. The purpose of the
tournament is to choose the
best individuals in the three
state region of North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia.
Each team plays three games
and the players are judged by
eight officials.

If chosen, the girl advances
to a regional tournament
where the same procedure
occurs. This system of choos-
ing players is used to get the
U.S. National Team, which is
formed next summer.

Last year, co-captain Kirk
Cameron was chosen at the
Deep South Tournament.

After having lost two games
in a row, most football teams
hope for the opportunity to
play an opponent on whom
they can take out their frus-
trations. But the Davidson

scrimmage wil be held in the
Charlotte Coliseum on Thursday,

All students are invited.
There will be no admission Charge.

Wildcats, who find themselves
in this position, will run out on
Richardson Field Saturday af-
ternoon, facing the University
of Delaware--a team that
soundly trounced DC 63-0 last
year.

Delaware enters the game
with a 4-3-1 slate, yet Head
Coach Ed Farrell points out
that they are physically strong
and very challenging on of-
fense as well as defense. This

observation is supported by
DU’s 28-0 shutout of Connec-

ticut last weekend.

Still, Farrell does not antici-
pate a letdown on the squad.
On the contrary, he stated
that ‘‘I know our team is
excited about playing Dela-
ware. We were in awe of them
last year,” he continued “and
we had a very young team.”

Mistakes also led to the
lopsided score.

Farrell believes that this
year’s edition of Davidson
football has a greater amount
of confidence now than it did
at this tame last year. He
declared that the squad is mad
at themselves over the Hamp-
den-Sydney loss of two weeks
ago and that the defeat at
VMI last weekend taught the
squad that they really area
good team.

offense,’’ he noted and added
‘‘T am hoping that we are
developing a genuine respect
for our own ability.”

He expressed the conviction
that to become a really compe-
titive team that an increase in
confidence is ‘The only thing
left to have us completely turn
the corner.”’

With the season nearing its
conclusion, Farrell reacted to
what has occurred thus far.
‘‘We’ve solidified what we
already thought’’--that being
that Davidson had a very
capable team. ‘‘We have at
times not played as well as we
are capable of playing.”

But he added that the only
time that the squad has really
been outmatched was against
Lehigh, and that was due to
the nationally recognized pas-
sing attack of the Engineers.

The fact that most pleases
Farrell has been the consis-
tently good play of the seniors
on the squad. With only six on
the team, they have been
called upon for more leader-
ship than in years past. The
coach noted that the seniors
have survived some rough
seasons, yet their enthusiasm
and dedication has remained
and it is a major reason for the
squad’s improvement.

““Every coach when re-
cruiting players tells them the
same thing,’’ Farrell began
“but it is our seniors who have
sold the school to the re-
cruits.”’

For this reason , Farrell is
optimistic’ about the remain-
der of this season and next
year. ‘‘With the dedication
displayed by these seniors, our
tgam should get better, and.
better.’
