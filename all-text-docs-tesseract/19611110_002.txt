Furtive Spying Reveals
Martin's Secret Avocation

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“It's sort of an unusual avocation,” admitted President D. Grier Martin of David-

son College, wnen questioned about his private sport of “frisbee throwing.”

The questioning centered a-
round President Martin’s: off-
hours preoccupation with a
flying-saucer-like plastic disk
known as a “frisbee.” Gnawing
curiosity about the manifesta-
tions of violent activity in the
Martins’ back yard led first to
furtive spying through hedges,
and finally, to an open interview
with the president.

“Last spring,” said Dr. Mar-
tin, “some of the boys developed
an interest in frisbee throwing.
They would play between Cham-
bers and my house, and |. used
to stop and watch them on my
way home.”

Dr. Martin was asked if he
would like to learn the art of
frisbee throwing. He said he was

—-=

willing, and asked that Joe
Robinson come over and give
him a few lessons.

“Joe was the champ of them
all,” he says. “He could throw
it a mile.”

“A few days later, I was
maneuvered into a game of
throwing it.” However, he was
greatly embarrassed because he
couldn't sail it straight or catch
it. “But one of the boys lent me
one to practice with.” he says.
and he promptly got involved in
another game.

“This time,” he says, “t was
asked if | would like to have
one. It developed that this per-
son had them for sale, large
ones for a dollar, and small ones
for 75 cents. So § got a large

The students seemed almost
to forget Miss Universe as they
tackled their first German

cheese more than anything.”

and no English, went on to com-

Cola! Delicious’!”

“Actually, 1 like Coke best of
all anyway,” she commented.

From her interpreter came a
friendly warning, “Ssh, Marlene,
the enemy may be listening!”

An old German man had push-
ed his way to her side for a pic-
ture. “If you're ever in Char-
lotte again and want to speak
German, just call on me. Heh,
heh.” :

A well-furred and obviously
thick-skinned Charlotte lady
rushed breathlessly up to one of
the Davidson boys. “You don't

ture with your camera. do you?
I want a picture of him with

ians, were greeted at St. Mark’s

details concerning the im-

_ Davidson College’s new 15 year plan.

Dr. Davidson stated that 150.-

ideal library for a school of
about 1.000 students.

At present, the Davidson li-

g5.000 - 90.000 volumes. and

| these sre being increased at the

rate of about 6,000 volumes a
year. This rate of increase will
provide the desired number of
volumes in about 15 years.
MORE SPACE NEEDED
The present library building. ;
Davidson said, will ‘“paek” this
number of books, but more

space will be needed to facili-

tate the handling and shelving

Except for this need for more

but he’s haa some difficulty
lately. For one thing, Joe Rob-
inson hasn’t been by to give
instruction in a long time.

He added, however, that the re-
serve reading room should be
enlarged, possibly into the up-
per floor of the new wing,

“I saw him just recently,” / though this was built to hold the

said Dr. Martin, “and asked him:
why he hadn’t been by, and in
explanation he stuck out his
foot. which unfortunately was '
broken.”

Hence the activity in the Mar-
tin back yard. Lacking a frisbee
mate, he’s forced to play with
it himself, throwing it. picking
it up. and throwing it again. Oc-
casionally he and. one of his
sons wili do battle with it,
throwing the frisbee straight .at
each. othe: at close range till
one of them drops it.

Refuting rumors that he had
an official frisbee throwing out-
fit, Dr. Martin said that he has
played in all sorts of costumes,
from business suits to shorts,
depending on the circumstances.
However, he does wear golf
shoes to avoid the occasional
spills he took as a novice.
‘When you're running and it

ed to enclose with the question-

reference,

Elaborating further on the
college's need for such informa-
tion. particularly the annual
rosters and evaluations, Dean
Burts pointed out that his office
is often asked for the record of
a student who graduated several
years ago.

As it is now, the college has
no way of knowing which stud: |
ents were actually active iny
which organizations during a
given year, nor are there any,
qualitative records on file as to
what kind of year the particular
group had.

Also, as Dean Burts said, this
information will assist students.
“These records will be kept to}

be fixed with shelves and stacks
with wire .in the front. This
room will be used chiefly for
display, though it will also be
open for student use.

The rare book collection has |

been growing; it now includes
an incunabulum (the only one
that Davidson has) given by
Mr. Harry Dalton of Charlotte.
This book is the Opera Omnia
of Seneca, printed in Venice in
1492.

Temporary Workshop
Built For Labs, ROTC

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Yes, the ROTC Department must have moved in about the middle of
the thirties.” Tom Johnson. the college electrician was saving, I was sitting somewhat
uncomfortably on the rim of a trash barrel watching the repairs progress on the
door to 323 Belk and listening to the nostalgia of the maintenance department.

The old: asbestos-clad. .twe- Ares. non parati ergo paci, oc: Cranks.-

| And after stories of the care-

their coal bins unlocked in old
Chambers, the thread of history
was taken up again. The ROTC,
established in 1919, occupied the
temporary building when the
labs moved to the newly com-
pleted south wing of Chambers.
And so it was until Belk dormi-
tory was built.

And when the valiant sons of

mined by Sidney. who started
from one and numbered them

éd each other's memories. “The

Upstairs was storage mostly

authority on the history of the
college is willing to bet came
from Phi Hall when it was re-
stored. There were signs pro-
claiming “NO TRESPASSING”
and “Huntersville Lion’s Club

Back downstairs Gabe and
Sydney were debating the chain
of command of the college em-
ployees.

The conversation was long
past the question and answer
stage by now, but closing time
was coming around, so I ex-
cused myself and thanked every-

Back in my room beneath the

But I got no further than the
paragraph containing the follow-
ing sentence. “The newer build-
ings, thoroughly modern
throughout, preserve the _ tie
with tradition by an adherence
in their exteriors to Classical
Revival forms.” So the squat lit-
tle building that’s older than
Chambers or any of the existing
corms challenges not only its
predestination to be “tempor-
ary.” but also the great and
hoary tradition of Davidson ex-
teriors.

You're needed... just as your father and grandfather
were. It’s an obligation that a lot of qualified college
men have to meet. If we don't... ;

All right. But what can I do for the Air Force?

The Air Force needs college trained men and women’
as officers. This is caused by the rapidly advancing
technology that goes with hypersonic air and space

flight. Your four years of college have equipped you
to handle complex jobs.

Say I was interested... how can I get to be an officer?
You know about Air Force ROTC and the Air Force

Academy. Then there's the navigator training pros
gram. You've probably heard about Officer Training
School...where the Air Force takes certain college
graduates, both men and women, and commissions
them after three months of training.

Starting salary is important. What about that?

Future You:

Add it up. Base pay, tax-free allowances, free medi:
cal and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps
flight pay. You don’t have to be an eco major to see
it adds up to an attractive package.

You:

As an officer you can apply for the Air Force Institute
