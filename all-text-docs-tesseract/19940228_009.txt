THE DAVIDSONIAN

Tis World is not Conclusion.
A species stands beyond -
Invisible, as Music -
But positive, as sound -.”
--Emily Dickinson

When we consider that we
might still exist after death, the
place that we imagine ourselves
going to seems somehow less real
than this world. We conjure up an
image of a somewhat faded, unre-
alistic state of being. In “heaven,”
we commonly think, we just sit
around and don’t have any troubles.

Ironically, the adjectives
“faded” and “unrealistic” are ones
that I would apply to our present
existence. The mystery that lies on
the other side of death, which we
call eternal life, holds what is real.

This eternal life has nothing to
do with time. It has everything to
do with reality. In fact, we should
not focus on the word “eternal,”
but the word “life.” This Life is the

The rich get rich fast because
they have capital at risk. In hard
economictimes they get poor pretty
damn fast, also. I’m sorry, but a

funds of a guy in the subway play-

As long as both of their situations
improve, we should be satisfied.
And it takes time for that.

Kreiling, proposing socialized
housing, talks about how we al-
ready have nationalized education
and transportation, two more of

her “human rights,” and are on the |

verge of socialized medicine.

How is the public school sys-
tem, Kim? Would we want to
pattern anything after the great
bastion of efficiency we call pub-
lic transportation? Why is every
other country in the whole world
moving its economy away from
socialism and toward the free mar-
ket, yet knee-jerk compassionists
and Clinton-style liberals buck the
trend? We have a word for this:
insanity.

But here comes the big one:
Kreiling says that we should res-
cue the homeless from an “unde-
sirable environment” and “subsi-
dize houses of the homeowners
choice.” First of all, there is no
such thing as a “homeowner” if
government subsidizes and pro-
vides the housing, and secondly,
why should taxpayers pay for
homeless people getting the choice
of the real estate litter? If Home-
less Joe says he wants to move into
a Beverly Hills mansion, we would
all now be obliged, according to
Kim, to buy it for him. This is
Frampton-style lunacy, pure and

Homesick in the
Shadowlands.

only reality.

This eternal Life is the Holy
Spirit that filled Christ at his bap-
tism. The same Spirit offers that
life tous. However, we are unable
to experience it fully as long as we
are living in this world.

Where we are living now are
the shadowlands. Our world is a
great shadow of the real life to
come. What, then, must that world
be like?

Imagine a chair and its char-
acteristics of color, texture, and
dimension. Then think of that
chair’s shadow; how plain, empty,
and boring the shadow is com-
pared to the object itself. In the
same way, our “lives” fade in com-

parison to real life.

Now, imagine that every once
in a while, a drop of the chair fell
into its shadow, and the light par-
ticles in the shadow were shown
their source of being. They’d be
blown away by its mystery. They’d
be fascinated by it and want to
know it again. But more impor-
tantly, they would realize their de-
pendence on it for their own exist-
ence,

We are trapped in this world
like little light particles inthe realm
of a shadow, and we belong to a
different world. No wonder we
feel empty, useless, and out of place
at the core of our hearts. Our
“lives,” without eternal life, are

virtual unreality.

C.S. Lewis said that to walk
out of God’s will is to walk no-
where. Here, Lewis has gone to
the extent of saying that this life of
shadows does not really exist. If
we are not “alive unto God” (Ro-
mans 6:9) then we are not alive at
all; we are walking in nothingness.

Similarly, William James said,
“Natural good is not simply insuf-
ficient in amount-and transient,
there lurks a falsity in its very
being.” He, too, is recognizing a
nihilism in any action or feeling
that is derived from our own na-
ture. James calls “natural good”
what we know as “good” here in
the shadowlands. Anything truly

good is of God.

The same relates to all that is
good: love, peace, joy. Alone, we
can only know the shadows of these
things. Real love and real happi-
ness, however, are available to us
now through the Holy Spirit. In
the world to come we will experi-
ence them in fullness. In other
words, we are not now living inthe
fullness of life, though wecanknow .
true life from time to time.

Do you remember the “amaz-
ing grace” that “...will lead me
home”? “Home” is where there
exists the fullness of eternal life.
We can tell when we are not there
by the authentic homesickness we
feel without it. ‘

So often people question the
meaning of life, when Life itself is
what they are missing. People
filled with true life would never
question their purpose. Too great
is the joy of being at home.

simple.

Kreiling ends her treatise say-
ing that her plan would be a “move
in the direction of justice and equal-
ity.” Justice, to me, means fair-
ness, getting what you pay for,
working towards a goal and achiev-
ing it. How is it just to transplant a
homeless person undeservedly into
the house of their dreams? Or do
they deserve it because they are
poor.

Also, when we say equality,
we mean equal rights. We do not
justify equal results, merely equal
opportunity. Kreiling is confused
here.

Kreiling’s subsidies would
endassoonas our homeless friends
are “self-sufficient.” How can they
become self-sufficient without a
job? They wouldn’t be homeless if
they hadone. Movingan untrained,
thus far unsuccessful person into a
castle will not really help the per-
son succeed. That is why the movie
Trading Places is so ironic and
hilarious.

Readers, look back a week
andsee, in black and white, the evil
we defeated in the Cold War. Take
a closer look at a philosophy of
mediocrity, an ideology which
would be happy and satisfied if the
gap between rich and poor were
narrowed so that everyone would
be poor, and nobody succeeded.
Look at this and reread my column
from last week about how we will
all be slaves of the government if
we donotresist this diseased theory
of collective economics.

We need not give the poor
bread, but rather teach them to
bake. In this, a meddling govern-
ment (which is how many home-
less would view Kreiling) has no
part.

Face to face with death

Death. To most people, espe-

cially to those of us still in our
tender youth, this word bears no
real significance.

Death merely represents
some abstract, mysterious idea that
seems far removed from our daily
lives. It’s all part of the invincible
“it can’t happen to me” attitude of
post-adolescents. Except for those
who have seen the face of death.

Anyway, my first indication
that this trip was surely going to
exceed my initial thoughts occurred
only a hundred yards into the cave.
The path seemed to drop abruptly
off into a S0-foot chasm. That was
a pretty short trip, I’m thinking.
Definitely not worth the 20 dollar

I realized what the face of death

Spelunking was something I’d al-

mind, the trip seemed harmless.
Big caverns, some stooping, maybe
a bit of crawling. How loud can

along the rim of the pit. You DO

was shimmying across the ledge,
my back against the cave wall,

any other, it shows us the courage
