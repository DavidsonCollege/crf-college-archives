Readers of this col-
umn uext week will
get an eye-witness ac-
count of the Confer-
ence goings-on and an
expert analysis of the
events narrated, Sam
Ervin, currently edi-
tor of this rag, who
filled this column
with wondrous words
of wisdom, will give
us unfortunates the
benefit of his obser-
vations. It is the first
time in five years that
the Cats have gone to
the tournament. They
stand filth place
among the competing

teams with a record of By MAC HART
10 wins to seven losses nie
in family competition, Six of these losses were to the tom

first teams, two each to State and Carolina, first and third
places respectively, and one apiece to George Washington and
Maryland. The other loss was a fluke to South Carolina who
slipped into the conference by virtue of a three way tie with
Wake Forest and William and Mary for eighth place.

SEASON RECORD GOOD

The Red and Blacks have a record to be proud of this
vear. In addition to the seven conference losses. we only have
one outside loss in 26 starts, Though the team as a whole has
not been as stellar as last year’s machine, Cheek and Williams
have stood out more as individual stars, when compared with
other basketeers of fame and ability.

MORE GAMES, BETTER PERCENTAGE

Last year, we only had six family losses, but our win
column was not any better padded, It only means that Coach
Shepard made sure that his team’s merit would be noticed this
year. Since we are always pretty sure to vet the worst end of
games with State, Carolina and Duke, we added inore conter-

{ sous to Increase our percentage

ence games with lesser foes,
That wav. there is less chance of teams that we have beaten
getting ahead of us in conference standing as South Carolina

did, last season.
CATS IN TOURNAMENT IN ‘43

The last. Davidson quintet to grace a conference fourna-
ment was the Tommy and George Peters—John Belk—Jim
Lowry—Pat Williams crew in “43. This combination beat State
33-30 in the opener before bowing out to George Washington
in the semi-finals, This vear we draw Maryland for the itttrad
encounter, and probably either Duke or George Washington,
if we can down the Terps.

In the Annual Indoor Track meet in Chapel Mill last week:
a couple of Davidson freshmen won some laurels for them-
selves. Blake Bradley, a harrier who first showed Davidson
his stuff against Washington and Lee last fall, placed third
among the collegians in the indoor mile,

CATS COUNTING ON PRICE AND ALEXANDER

As the Cat wrestlers leave Sunday for Lexington where
the conference wrestling finals will be held, they carry hopes
that our season stalwarts, Mott Priee and Bull Alexander, may
make good and maybe bring back conference
crowns., Jimmy Jung, who will make the trip, will probably
not see action since he is still suffering from his shoulder, sepa-
ration, Stubby Evans is another Wildcat who is counted on to
stick in there with the best-of them Stubbs wrestled with
Woodberry Morrest fist vear and was state champion in his
class. Without uch hope for team honors, the Cats never-
theless expect to bring home a nice slice of the cake,

PHI GAM DARK HORSES

Tuesday thetime tals for Coach Whittle’s interfrat track
meet were run off with few or no spectacular results. Certainly
no new ‘Sparky’? was unleased, though the Phi Gams did
come throneh with two dark horses. Freshman Tommy Haller,
Jayvet basketballer, came through with good form and fairly
good time on the low hurdles, and placed high in the broad

showings,

jumping. Kd Newton is not exactly new since he wrecked some
havoe in last year’s meet. Tlowever, like everybody else, his
achievements were thrown into the shadows that day, and

a pulled muscle kept him out of Pete’s hands for the re-
mainder of the season, Even with a wet track, he had the best
time on the 100 and broke the intramural record for the 220.

KAPPA SIGS BEAT BETAS, ALSO TIE ’EM

Wednesday night the final round of intramural basket-
ball was finished leaving only two teams tied invfirst place
where there were six three weeks ago. The Betas and Kappa
Sigs maintained their records of only one lose to tie for first
place. The Kappa Sigs Jost to the Independents and the Betas
lost to the Kappa Sigs. Even tho this would seem to eiye the
Kappa Sigs an edge over the Betas, it is the policy to count
only percentages, even in case of a tie. Of the Independents,
Phi Delts, Phi Gams and Pi Kapps who were all neek and
neck with the league leaders at midseason, the Independents
copped second place and the Phi Delts and Phi Gams wound
up in a third place tie.
