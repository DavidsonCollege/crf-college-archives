If You Build It, They Will Come: A Call For a New Union

By Alex Crumbley

Itis no secret that much of the
faculty and administration want to
dispose of Patterson Court. They
argue that the court is Davidson’s
center of underage drinking, thatit
promotes an unhealthy separation
of the sexes during lunch and din-
ner, and that it segregates much of
the student body into fraternity or
eating house cliques.

Policies like the 40 percent
rule for fraternities on upperclass
halls and the new alcohol policy
are designed in partto diminish the
distractions of alcohol and parties
inour lives and to promotea breadth
of social interaction among
Davidson students.

In many respects, the critics
of Patterson Court are right. Ste-

reotyping, cliques, and distracting
parties do occur around the court,
but the court is a symptom, not the
cause, of such problems. People
tend to find a group and stay in it.
If Patterson Court were removed,
personal stereotyping and cliquing
would still occur, only in a less
definite form. For example, limit-
ing the number of parties on the
court has not ended the problems
of underage drinking. The re-
straints of the alcohol policy have
not stopped students’ parties; it
has only moved them to residence
halls or off campus houses or bars.
The answer to our problems is

not to remove something but to
add something. If students are
going to leave the court, they must
have a reason, a better place to go.

They mustwant to leave.

That is why the idea to build a
new and improved student union
could not have come at a better
time. The Union’s purpose is evi-
dent in its name, and the one we
have now simply does not do the
the task. It is away from the resi-
dential facilities on campus; its
rooms are small, its cafe-
underequipped to handle many stu-
dents. As of now, the Union and
its 900 Room are not viable alter-
natives for students in search of a
social life at Davidson.

If built right, the new union
could add eating facilities to cam-
pus, encouraging house members
to eat lunch together at a central
location. It could house a student-
run radio station which could give

students more of a feeling of to-
getherness and identity. It could
have a bigger place for campus
functions and campuswide parties.
Itcould have gathering placesmuch
more attractive than “‘the pit” which
‘is presently our cool hang-out lo-
‘cation. The possibilities are end-
less,as are theimprovements which
could be made tox student life
through building this new union.
As for professors who think
our money could be better spent, I
encourage you to look at the long-
term benefits of building a new
union. If we could make it fash-
ionable to go to the union, Pattersoh
Court activity would decrease and
people would begin to break
through many barriers ingrained in
our community as it is now.
Better places to congregate
would allow a more diverse and

open exchange of ideas to take
place at a dinner table or in a study
lounge. If we have something to
do besides drinking on Patterson
Court, we may become better stu-
dents all around.

The idea of the women’s
houses eating together in the Com-
mons for lunch is good. Unfortu-
nately, though many men also like
the idea, it will take a long time for
the fraternities to follow the
women’s lead.

But abolition of the fraterni-.
ties is not the answer, and neither is
forcing them to eat in the Com-
mons. If you give us a reason to
venture out of our houses, we will.
If you build anew union with some
good restaurants and recreational
facilities in it, we will eat there and
come together. Until then, don’t
blame us for staying home.

ing which makes the classroom
experience here special.

If a small percentage of
courses is dropped to achieve bal-
ance, the loss iscompensated many
times over by the gain. The hall-
mark of a good education is qual-
ity, not quantity. The number of
different courses a student takes is
less important than the educational
experience within each course.

Thoughtful educators worry
that the “cafeteria” of highly-spe-

cialized courses has already been -

developed too far. The final step
toward institutional excellence will
now be to cultivate a campus at-
mosphere conducive to reading,
study andreflection, anatmosphere
in which the habits of mental disci-
pline can be acquired.

Students Should Be Involved in Changes

munity at this school. The trend to
put less emphasis on classroom
teaching as opposed to research is
paradoxical given our commitment
to the liberal arts. The Davidson
College statement of purpose reads:
"In implementing its purpose
to promote higher learning,
Davidson has chosen to be a col-
lege, to maintain itself as a small
community of learners, to empha-
size the teaching responsibility of
all professors, and to ensure the
opportunity for personal relation-
ships between students and teach-
ers. :
"It is vital that all students,
freshmen as well as upperclass- .
men, know and study under ma-
ture and scholarly teachers who
are able and eager to provide for
each of them stimulus, instruction
and guidance. ...In the selection
of teachers it must seek individu-

als of genuine spirituality who are
outstanding intellectually, who
have the best training available in
their fields of study, and whose
interestinthe students andinteach-
ing is unfeigned and profound."
We perceive that this most
recent policy change is notin keep-
ing with our college’s purpose.
Davidson is not a state university,
and it was not meant to be. The
diminished course selection that

will surely result from this move :

will provide less of an opportunity
for development of “persons of
humane instincts, of discipline and
creative minds, ... of service, and
of self-fulfillment.”

We have chosen Davidson for
our undergraduate studies for many

reasons, none of which includes:

less course breadth or a restrictive
faculty and administration.

In attending Davidson, we
expect to have personal and pro-
ductive relationships with all

school officials. Instead, present
animosity between students and
faculty mars this ideal.

It is time for the administra-
tion to approach the students in
order to preserve the qualities of
Davidson that we cherish before
repl
overdevelopment. An open forum
with observable results based on
student input is especially impor-
tant regarding changes in college
policy directly affecting our aca-
demic and personal futures.

The college exists for the stu-
dents, not to create career opportu-
nities for the faculty and adminis-

_tration. It is the responsibility of

the school to include the students
in important decisions and to re-
spect and act upon their opinions.
We can only be ope for so
long.

Sincerely,

Will Canu &

Sand Castles at the Beach

I have a need to go to the
beach every so often. There’s
something very refreshing and re-
newing about the ocean.

Ihavealways loved the beach.
When | was six, my family went to
Myrtle Beach in South Carolina
for summer vacation. It’s the first
time I can remember being at the
beach. I was amazed. It was the
most water I had ever seen in any
one place before.

My favorite pastimes then

» were-running as fast.as my: little ;
“r~. legs could carry me into the on-

coming surf until I tripped on a
wave and went splashing to the
ground, and building sand castles.

It was my father who intro-
duced me to the concept of build-
ing sand castles. His, as I remem-
ber, _was_very_precise and sym-
metrical; he used those little pre-
fab buckets, a spade, anda level. I
was fascinated by the whole idea -
maybe because of the romantic
aspect of castles, or because it
brought out the budding civil engi-
neer in me, who knows?

My plans were monumental.
I undertook construction, deter-
mined to make something Guiness
(The Book of Records, not the beer)
would have to recognize. I made
numerous inner courtyards, para-
pets, bridges, watch towers, motes.
You name it - this castle had it.
(Except for indoor plumbing. I
figured, hey, the knights could go
while they were taking aswim, just
like me.)

- I accepted no help on the
project. My little sister tried to
assist, but I swatted her away with
a play shovel and threw sand at
her, causing my mother to yell
“Play nice with your sister” and
give me the obligatory slap on the
butt.

Once I had completed all the
living quarters, I started work on
the important parts - the outer walls
and fortifications. I decided three
walls would do the trick. Idug and

_piled and dug and packed. Al-

though the eastern walls would
have to be the thickest and most
fortified, I decided that the walls
should also extend around the en-
tire castle, on the off-chance that
some wave might try a sneak at-

tack from behind.

My project had taken on such
proportions that parents and their
children walking down the beach
would stop to admire the work and
effort and castle of the this sweat-
ing, tan, sand-covered little child.

Yes, as a matter of fact, I have
always been obsessive.

The sun began to fall, and my
mother was calling me to dinner as

I put the final touches on the outer-
most wall. As a finishing touch, I
placed. two. Playmobil knights. on
the towers in the inner courtyard to
watch over the castle while I was
away for the night.

I woke the next moming and
went to see how my castle had
fared the night. I walked out to the
beach, and felt rather disoriented.
There was no castle. I looked back
up to the beachhouse to make sure
that it was, in fact, our house. Yep.
OK, maybe I built the castle either
up- or down-beach. A thorough
combing of the area, however, re-
vealed no castle. Where had it
gone?, my little mind ranged. I
was very upset. I didn’t ask my
parents who had taken the castle,
however, for fear of punishment
for the lost Playmobil guys (who, I
realize now, were on their way to
Morocco.)

Last week during spring break,
I built anothercastle. This one was
smaller, more symmetrical, and
morecynical. Connected beer tabs
served as drawbridge chains.. Li-
quor and cigarette labels adorned
the watch towers and bastions.

And sure enough, when I
awoke the next morning, thiscastle
too was gone. There’s a differ-
ence, though: when I was six, I
built the castle with the intent that
it should stand there forever. This
one I built so thatitcould be washed
away.

I walked on the beach for a
while, looking around, justtomake
sure the castle was gone. It was. I
reached down and picked up a
handful of sandand watched it run
through my fingers and blow away
in the wind, and hoped that some-
day I wouldcome back to the beach,
and build another sand castle.
