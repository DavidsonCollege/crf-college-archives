Paternal Advice

Sky drifting through the eycalypts
Lush oat and blackfaced fields
Kneeing ourWay through bristles
We flush inside our jackets

As a dragon-cloud

Bites the red sky.

A straight-nosed fencepost

You watch mares canter like cheeky ponies.
In your bareheaded, khaki manner
You tell me | can believe in myself

And only myself
You, the persevering one

The blood of success

Drained from your face.

All | want to do

Is believe your assurances

About the worth

Of hard work, scenery, and children.
