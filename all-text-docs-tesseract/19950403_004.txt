This past week the SGA over-
whelmingly voted to support recy-
cling at Davidson, A sum of $200
will be given to campus services
and facilities to support the stu-
dent-led recycling effort. The
money, according to SGA Vice
President Warren Buford, “will be
primarily used to purchase large
recycling bins for the Patterson
Court houses.”

WDAV
holds
spring
member
drive

Although asking WDAV lis-
teners to purchase individual mem-
berships for the radio station may
not be the station’s favorite task,
WDAV’s biannual membership

drives provide crucial funding for -

the station’s budget. From Friday,
March 24 to Sunday, April 2,
WDAV held its Spring Member-
ship Drive.

Program underwriting by busi-
nesses and corporations and single
memberships comprise two-thirds
of WDAV’s budget. Davidson
College provides nine percent of
the station’s budget, while the re-
maining portion comes from fed-
eral support.

Because Congress is consid-
ering a reduction in funds for pub-
lic broadcasting, WDAV’s indi-
vidual membership support is more
important than ever before.

Legislation to decrease pub-
lic broadcasting funds by 15 per-
cent next year and 30 percent in
1997 has already passed the House
of Representatives.

This legislation would cost
WDAV $30,000 next year and
$52,000 per year starting in 1997.
The station’s goal for this mem-
bership drive is 1,700 member-
ships.

Station Manager John Clark
hopes more individuals will want
to purchase memberships at the
end of the drive to help WDAV
reach its goal and continue the

classical music programming that -

many listeners enjoy.

with Patterson Court Council last
Sunday to gauge support. House
leaders at PCC also voted to sup-
port the recycling program. Ac-
cording to Buford, Patterson Court
seems enthusiastic about the stu-
dent-run program.

At SGA, representatives ad-
vised that the bins be large in order
to successfully accommodate the
large volume of recyclables at the
houses. Concern was expressed
over manpower, considering that
the current plan places the respon-
sibility of removing the recyclables

onthe house members themselves: Faas
Other representatives thought the faa
easiest solution would be forhouses Baa

to incorporate removal into their
clean-ups.

After the bins have been suc-
cessfully installed on Patterson
Court, the program plans to branch
out into halls. The effort hopes to
place bins wherever there is sup-
port for campus-wide recycling.

SGA President Bill Gullan
commented that attempts to secure
institutional support for the pro-
gram will continue.

CRIME REPORT

The Night

from page 3

“The first Take Back the Night
at Davidson sprang from the real-
ization [that as a committee] we
had done a lot of good things, but
we hadn’t touched the heart of the
matter. We hadn’t touched the
hearts of survivors of sexual as-
sault,” says Carlson.

When asked what exactly ag-
gravates the problem of rape on
Davidson’s campus, Carlson re-

sponds, “I think that it involves
both communication and alcohol,
for sure. A lot of women at
Davidson are assertive profession-
ally as a student, but in their per-
sonal lives, they aren’t.”

Carlson adds, “We're not say-
ing people should be expected to
reject or withdraw from the social
scene here at Davidson. It’s excit-
ing to see the number of people
who feel that they can integrate
being socially and sexually respon-
sible. But you must take precau-
tions, and most importantly, trust
your instincts.”
