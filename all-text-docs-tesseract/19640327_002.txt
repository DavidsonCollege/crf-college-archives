Selah --- Stitt ...

- If any Grand Finale editorials about
this year are written. they'll be writ--
ten by Charlie Dibble. These two edi-
torials are, contrary to any known
journalistic policies. primarily for the
benefit of the editors writing them.

I wish to express my particular
thanks to Tim Kimrey (Associate Edi-
tor Emeritus), Tom Loflin, and Rick
Lowery for their respective roles this
year in making this newspaper read-
able again. Also to Charles Ramberg,
Jimmy Downey, and John Todd—
these three do the background work
that keeps this thing coming out once
a week. Besides being highly compe-
tent and a pleasure to work with,
above all they've been loyal, and that
has meant an aivfttl lot.

Many people have complimented
us at Jength this vear when we were
on their side on a particular issue.
But as issues changed, things got
mean when the backslappers were
touiched personally.

‘Therefore, I also want to express
much appreciation to some people I
think of in frequent states of mild
paranoia as the Good Guys,

These are the people that are in-
tellectually and spiritually big enough
to accept other people as worthwhile
human beings, even if the “others”
are twenty-year-old college kids pur-

... And Lowery

The past year has been a very
pleasurable one for me. The pleasure

as been the result of an opportunity
to come in contact with a great var-
iety of people. These have been
athletes, coaches, and people.

I’ve had an opportunity to see the
effects (before and after) of a success-
ful athietic team. The effects have
probably done more to foster a gen-
uine interest in Davidson on the part
of students, alumni. and friends than
any other single event in my memory.
In addition, this team has probably
been more successful in fracturing
the semi-isolation effect that the fra-
ternity system has had on this cam-
pus than any other recent event.

I’ve had an opportunity to see ten-
nis and baseball reinstated to posi-

Baseball Team Romps,

porting to have the definitive word on
nearly everything. Although these
people have frequently taken violent
exception to things we’ve written,
they have never taken exception to

us.

Three people ranking high in this
category include two trustees, Dr. J.
McDowell Richards and Dr. Tolly
Thompson, both of whom have a rare
understanding of the Christian ethic
of genuine basic respect for one’s
fellow man. The third is Dr. D. Grier
Martin. who has always been extreme-
ly decent to us even when he has had
more than adequate cause to be other-
wise.

In mentioning those three, we omit
the names of several others who have
helped us this year in keeping atti-
tudes positive, and to those we are
equally indebted. They have written
or called from time to time through-
out the year just to generally wish
us well. The Good Guys have meant
a lot. too.

Finally, my thanks to one Charlie
Dibble, who has put more time and
creative effort into the paper this
year than anyone else on the staff.
including the editor. That he will put
out a fine paper next year is beyond
all doubt. The best of everything to
him and his staff.

DTS

tions of respectability, a chance to see
many fine athletes, and many not so
ine.

But the pleasure of the job has
been provided by the people of the
“little” newspaper world. Such peo-
ple as Charlie Dibble, David Stitt, and
Tom Loflin, to name a few.

Most important; however, is the
man whose title is Assistant Sports
Editor—Bob Strauser. The use of the
term “assistant’’ is misleading. Bob
has been one-half Editor; I, the other
half. To recount the work, laughs, and
Spears experienced would make
pretty maudlin reading for aryone
else, but I thought I’d make my grati-
tude formal to Bob Strauser for the
work and time he’s invested.

It’s been my pleasure.

Tennis Season Young;

It is undoubtedly too early ‘to

ball. The season is young, and
the present 30 record means
very little perhaps.

BY BILL BRIGGS

Davidson sports fans have had an unusual year. First, one of the best soccer teams in the South, then
one of the best basketball teams in the nation, now a new sport to point to has emerged from behind the ivy-
covered walls and intellectual pillars of ‘mighty little Davidson”—tennis.

even though has been of a sub-
stantial nature. After two vic-
tories last week over Cumber-
Jand College and Ohio Wesleyan

Slater Regains ‘A’ Rating;
Rats, Roaches Repelled

The Davidson College Student
Union cafeteria has had its
health-grade notice returned
with a grade of ‘‘A’’ but with a
1.8 per cent decrease in sanita-
tion rating.

Inspector Noah Walters. who
had removed the notice and ad-
vised cafeteria manager H. R.
Bryson to clean up the kitchen.
said in a _ recent interview
that ‘‘just about everything was
improved.’’ He added that he
saw “no evidence of roaches or
rats’ on a recent visit.

Bryson stated that really not
much more than routine clean
ing procedures had been em-
ployed. He did say that he had
“stepped up the pest control
rate." He further emphasized
that the cafeteria would always
strive to improve its rating.

But Slater’s woes have not
been confined to the David-
son campus. The following ap-
peared in a recent issue of the
University of South Carolina

“Foreign particles, so often
found in food prepared by the
Slater Food Service, will soon
be a thing of the past. af

“In an exclusive interview this

quently express dissatisfaction
with the limited choice of veg-
etables, especially concerning

the ever-present green beans:
yet Mr. Troup insists that green
beans remain the biggest sell-
er.”

Spratt Cites Progress
On Two-Way Front

President John Spratt reported to the Student Coun-
‘il this week on the results ot several proposals made to
he Student-Faculty Conference Committee concerning

ne “campusing” restriction

No one on the committee,
which consists of faculty and
student representatives, object-
ed to giving the Honor Court
priority of jurisdiction in cases
involving the campusing penal-
ty and/or overcutting required
exercises.

Spratt said that President D.
G. Martin had asked Dean
Richard C. Burts to submit a
memo to the Faculty Executive
Committee: therefore, nothing
definite will be known until
next month.

The trial system of allowing
morning church attendance in
the town of Davidson to substi-
tute for required vespers at-
tendance will definitely be in
effect again next year, Spratt
said: however the number of
substitutions allowed in town
will probably be limited.

Spratt said that he spoke out
against allowing out-of-town
church attendance to substi-
tute for vespers, ‘‘mainly be-
cause it would defeat the only

‘WELL-KNOWN FAMOUS PEOPLE: No. 1

This is the first in a series of 48 million columns examining the
careers of men who have significantly altered the world we live
in. We begin today with Max Planck.

Max Planck (or The Pearl of the Pacific, os he is often
called) gave to modern physics the law known as Planck’s
Constant. Many people when they first hear of this law, throw
up their hands and exclaim, ‘Golly whiskers, this is too deep
for little old me!”

, Mncidentally, speaking of whiskers, I cannot help but men-
tion Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades. Personna is the
blade for people who can’t shave after every meal. It shaves
you closely, cleanly, and more frequently than any other
stainless steel blade on the market. The makers of Personna
have publicly declared—and do here repeat—that if Personna
Blades don’t give you more luxury shaves than any other
stainless steel blade, they will buy you whatever blade yor
nin is better. Could anything be more fair? I, for one, think
not.

thar Stoned w indicrtor......

But I digress. We were speaking of Planck's Constant, which
is not, as many think, difficult to understand. It simply states
that matter sometimes behaves like waves, and waves some-
times behave like matter. To give you a homely illustration,
pick up your pencil and wave it. Your pencil, you will surely
agree, is matter—yet look at the little rascal wave! Or take
flags. Or Ann-Margret.

Planck’s Constant, uncomplicated as it is, nevertheless pro-
vided science with the key that unlocked the atom, made space
travel possible, and conquered denture slippage. Honors were
heaped upon Mr. Planck (or The City of Brotherly Love, as
he is familiarly known as). He was awarded the Nobel Prize,
the Little Brown Jug, and Disneyland. But the honor that
pleased Mr. Planck most was that plankton were named after

m.
Plankton, as we know, are the floating colonies of one-celled
animals on which fishes feed. Plankton, in their turn, feed
upon one-half celled animals called krill (named, incidentally,
ter Dr. Morris Krill who invented the house cat). Krill, in
their turn, feed upon peanut butter sandwiches mostly—or,
when thoy are in season, cheeseburgers. .

But I digress. Back to Max Planck who, it must be said,
showed no indication of his scientific genius as a youngster.
In fact, for the first six years of his life he did not speak at all
except to pound his spoon on his bow! and shout ‘More gruel P2
Imagine, then, tho surprise of his nts when on his seventh
birthday little Max suddenly cried, “Papa! Mama! Something
is wrong with the Second Law of Thermodynamics !” So aston-
ished were the elder Plancks that they rushed out and dug the

ie .

Meanwhile Maz, constructing a crude Petrie dish out of two
small pieces of petrie and his gruel bowl, began to experiment
with thermodynamics. By dinner time he had discovered
Planck’s Constant. Hungry but happy, he rushed to Heidelberg
University to announce his findings. He arrived, unfortunately,
during the Erich von Stroheim Sesquicentennial, and everyone
was so busy dancing and duelling that young Planck could find
nobody to listen to him. The festival, however, ended after
two years and Planck was finally able to report his discovery.

Well sir, the rest is history. Einstein gaily cried, “E equals
me squared!” Edison invented Marconi. Eli Whitney invented
Georgia Tech, and Michelangelo invented the ceiling. This
later became known as the Humboldt Current.
