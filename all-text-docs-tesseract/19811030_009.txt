_ THE DAVIDSONIAN.

PosT OFFICE Box 218, DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA 28036

Circa 1860 Davidson College commissioned J.W. Orr, a New York engraver, to make a
woodcut of the first Chambers building. Although Orr’s original has been lost, a few |
pieces of stationery on which the woodcut adornéd the letterhead have been preserved.
This facsimile of the Orr letterhead was made from a letter written by J.M. Potts on 1
August 1863. Louis Orr, a descendent of J.W. Orr, made the contemporary series of
etchings of North Carolina scenes that hang on the main floor of the E.H. Little Library.

Subscriptions cost 10. per year within the United States and its possessions;
14. per year elsewhere in North America; 20. in Europe (28. air-speeded). .

Rates for the Far East and Oceania upon request.
