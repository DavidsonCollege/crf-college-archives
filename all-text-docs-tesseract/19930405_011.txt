Men's Tennis Splits Southern Conference Matches

By Brannon Buck

The Davidson Men’s tennis
team played two Southern Confer-
ence matches this weekend, losing
to Furman on Friday but defeating
Western Carolina on Saturday.
Coach Frank was pleased with the
team’s effort and concentration de-
spite the loss.

And the player’s now know
more about where they stand in rela-
tion to the top teams in the confer-
ence.

Albie Varoski stood out both
days, winning the team’s only match
against Furman and playing solidly
in a victory over Western Carolina.

.

rebounded to defeat Western by the
same score. There were several close
matches both days.

The rest of the team dropped

tight matches to Furman, but the
loss was definitely not devastat-
ing. Coach Frank stressed to his
players that they now know ex-
actly what they must do to pre-
pare for the conference tourmna-
ment. He said the first step would
be tocome back and play astrong
match the next day.

And that is exactly whatthey
did by only losing one match toa
good team from Western Caro-
lina.

Varoski defeated Colin
Delany from Furman in three sets
2-6, 6-1, 6-2,.and then won an-
other tight match against James
Gasparini of Western Carolina

Women's

LacrosseTeam

By Mandy Curtis

This past weekend of the third
and fourth of April, the women’s
lacrosse team traveled to Virginia to
play Randolph-Macon College
where they were defeated by a score
of 15-14. With only 36 seconds left
in the game, the opposing team
scored the final goal that decided the
game.

Having been up 6-0 in the first
10 minutes of the game and 10-6 at
the half, the “Cats lost their lead in
the second half.

According to offensive sla
Megan Snyder, the team was upset
by many of the-officials’ ““question-
able” calls. She explained thatin the
second half of the game the officials
took one of the Davidson players out
of the game and into a penalty box
for wearing awatch. However, there
is no such thing as a penalty box in
lacrosse. In the time that the
Davidson player was out of the game,
leaving the ‘Cats numerically disad-
vantaged, Randolph-Macon man-
aged to score.

Despite the loss, Snyder said
the Wildcats “played really well asa
team.” Instead of having a few “su
perstars” who scored all of the goals
as Randolph-Macon had, Davidson
showed strength as a unit, explained
Snyder, “We passed really well...
We left knowing that we played bet-
ter as ateam.” Another disappoint-
ment for the women’s lacrosse team
was the cancellation of Sunday’s
game in Harrisonburg against James
Madison University. Hoping to
schedule a gameagainst another team
in the area, they were not successful
and arrived home early on Saturday
night in time for the KA bam dance.

This Tuesday, April 6, the Wild-
cats will travel to play Greensboro
College for the second time of the
season. The ‘Cats previously de-

feated this team by a score of 18-1”

last Tuesday and hope to do as well
this week. The ‘Cats will be hosting
a lacrosse tournament on the week-
end of the 17th and 18th. They will
be playing 5 games which will be
their last home games of the season.

Freshmen, Seniors
Dominate IMAC Season

Skearies forced freshman 4th Watts
into a grueling two game champi-
onship. However, 4th Watts capi-
talized on Skeary John Hudson’s
unfortunate injury. The five-on-

the 4th Watts victory.

Upper B-League. Green Eggs and
Grits, the athletic dynamos from

Women's Tennis
Comes Down
After Amazing Start

By Robert Lloyd-Still

The Davidson women’s ten-
nis team began Southern Confer-
ence play in perfect fashion. With
victories over Georgia Southem,
App. St, and UT-Chattanooga, the
‘Cats appeared to have a legiti-
mate shot at a perfect conference
season. However things changed
quickly when the ‘Cats faced
Furman, losing 9-0. On Saturday,
the ‘Cats rebounded from this loss
with a 9-0 pouncing of Western
Carolina.

Davidson played hard against
Furman, butthe Paladins were sim-
ply too:tough. The Paladins are
defending champions in the South-
em Conference and they are one of
the South’s foremost teams. Pres-
ently, they have a one game lead
on Davidson. After struggling with
Furman, the ‘Cats played excep-
tionally well against WCU with
great performances out of Nicole
Wilcox, Cynthia-Hess, and Jenni-

fer Beahm. Davidson’srecord now
stands at 6-1 in the conference and
10-3 overall.

Earlier in the week, the ‘Cats
defeated Appalachian St.’by,a 9-0
score. In the three matches previ-
ous to Furman, Jennifer Beahm
and Nicole Wilcox were on an
unbelievable streak. They both
managed to win all three of their
singles matches and when they
teamed up at doubles they swept
three victories there as well. Fresh-
man Sarah Heer has also helped
the ‘Cats of late. At the number
four spot, she has managed a 5-1
mark in the conference and 10-1
for the season.

Davidson only has two more
matches before the Southern Con-
ference Championships on April
16 and 17,

On April 6, the ‘Cats will be at
home to face Winthrop and they
travel to Raleigh on April 13 to
face N.C, State.
