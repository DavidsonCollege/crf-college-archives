Students Answer When
Congress. Declares War

in World Conflict

When war was declared in April, 1917, and
call was sent out to the collegs of the coun-
try to support the country, Davidson answer-
Union. i

The first men to do their part were some
ed the call as did every other college in the
80 students who left the college to help in
food production at their homes. They were
soon followed by other men and between
April 1, 1917, and September 1, 1918, 152
students of the college enlisted. Fifty-five
of these were of the two Senior classes of
the period.

In the summer ‘of 1918 the seriousness of
the situation led to the establishment .of the
Student’s Army Training Corps, which was

lishment of this unit, during the summer of

| 1918, four professors and 33 students went to

Plattsburg to receive instruction that would
| fit them for assisting in teaching military
science,

All men 18 or over who were registered on |

September 12, 1918, and who were physically |

fit and prepared for college work, took the

oath of allegiance on October 1, 1918. They

| thus became regular soldiers on active duty

as members of the’S. A. T..C. These men

The oath of allegiance-was taken just
south of Shearer Hall at noon. This scene,
of 223 young Americans taking the oath of !
fealty to their country, marked the’ beginning
of the S. A. T. C. and also the beginning of
an epidemic of influenza that struck the col-
lege on that: day.

and Georgia,

Nearly one thousand Davidson men enter-
ed the service of their country. About five
hundred and eighty alumni of the college
enlisted and over one hundred and fifty stu-
dents joined the active army. In addition to
the above there were two hundred and twen-
ty-three students in the college who were
members of the S. A. T. C. There were
three hundred and sixty-six commissioned
officers from the Davidson contingent, rang-
ing from a brigadier general to one hundred
and forty-four second lieutenants, with
various lower officials in the navy. Also
from the teaching staff five men volunteered,

‘| of whom two were full professors.

Twenty-one men gave their lives for their
country. On this roll of honor the oldest
class represented is that of 1886, and the
latest that of 1919.

Manager of Paper
to be Chosen Soon
In the next few days, the Board of Pub-
Austin, L. D. Wharton and Professors

Fleagle and Jackson, will meet for the pur-
pose of selecting the business manager of

The Davidsonian, for the coming year. The
business manager this year is V. S. Broyles, |
and he and his staff have taken care of their |
end of the paper admirably, having made The |
Davidsonian of this year the greatest finan- |
cial success it has ever been.

|

Although the Board of Publications meets |
every year to seléct the business manager, |
this year is the first time it has become neces- |
sary to decide between three men, since it |
has happened in the past years that only one |
Junior has been eligible for the position. The |
aspirants for this position are as follows: |
M. L. Crawford, E. L. Douglass, and Julian |
Lake. These men have worked hard and |
faithfully during the years’ they have been
at Davidson, and have done much for The
Davidsonian in the way of securing adver-
tisements and subscriptions.

The new business manager, after he, has
been appointed, will in turn appoint his staff
| for the coming year. ~ These appointments
will be published in the issue of The Da-
vidsonian which is to come out during Junior
Speaking,

D.C. Debaters Meet
Opponents in North

Davidson’s Varsity Debating Team is at
present on its Northern trip, which includes
contests with several leading schools of the
country. The team is composed of L. D.
Wharton and W. H. Branch, who are fore-
most in all types of literary activity pn the
campus, and are well known as excellent de-
baters and speakers. These two are making
their fourth consecutive trip together as
members of the debating team, and in that
time, debating together, they have lost only
one debate, that being the one with Sewance
last year. Such a record is proof of their
efficiency in that line of activity.

The question that the team will debate on
this trip is: “Resolved, That the United
States should cancel the Inter-Allied War
Debts due her.” The Davidson men will de-

the negative once, and the affirmative three
times.

The schools with whom this query will be
debated are as follows: William and Mary,
on April Ist, at Williamsburg, Va.; Bethle-
hem College, at Bethlehem, Pa., will be met

Outside of the commissioned officers Da-

following examples show. Some of these
were cooks, corporals, signalmen, dental
surgeons, sergeants, camp pastors, and Red

| Cross workers.

Current Events

The Cantonese authorities have been in-
formed that the British Cabinet has approved
the demand for reparation for the outrages
at Nanking. Great Britain also demands
that the perpetrators of these outrages be
punished, and apologies be offered to the
governments whose consulates were attacked
and looted. This demand will be announced,
at Washington and Tokyo in the hope that

protest of such outrages. If these nations
will not aid Great Britain, she will act alone.

Orders have been prepared for the dispatch
of two more battalions of marines to San
Diego. There are now two regiments less
two battalions either in China or on their
way. ' These two battalions will be held in
readiness and used to supplement the forces
in China if they are needed.

A windstorm which threatened to become
a cyclone struck Winston-Salem and Dur-
ham last Friday, causing a damage of many
thousands of dollars. Presbyterian College
at Clinton, Spartanburg, Laurens, and other
South Carolina cities were hit by this storm.
Though no deaths have been reported, the
damages will probably amount to several
hundred thousand dollars,

X-Ray pictures reveal the fact that in-
juries received by Henry Ford in an auto-
mobiel wreck last week are not) serious. In
response to his request, the billionaire manu-
facturer has been removed from the hospital
to his home. Doctors say that he will be

the United States and Japan will join in the ,

on April 5th; Gettysburg University follows
on April 6th, at Gettysburg, Pa.; Rutgers
University, at New Brunswick, N. J., is the
last school to be visited and will be met on
April 8th. The team is expected to arrive at
Davidson on April 12th>

As mentioned before, the team will uphold
the negative against William and Mary,
while in all the other contests they will de-
bate on the affirmative side of the question.
While in Washington, they will probably try
to secure interviews with President Coolidge
and Honorable Andrew; W. Mellon, Secre-
tary of Treasury, and discuss the vital sub-
ject with these prominent national officials.
Referring to their past record, it can rea-:
sonably be expected that the team will be
victorious in at least a majority of their de-
bates, and such will no doubt be the result.

The employer called his secretary.

“Here, John, look at this letter. I can't
make out whether it’s from my tailor or my
lawyer. They’re both named Smith.”

And this is what John read: “I have be-
gun your suit. Ready to be tried on Thurs-
day. Smith.”

Ford states that the wreck was the result of
carelessness, and was not an attempt to mur-
der him.

PRITCHETT AND GRADY LOSE

(Contmued from page 1)
were on the Freshman Team which debated
against the University of North Carolina
last year, Pritchett having debated at Chapel
Hill and Grady at Davidson.

The selection of these two men is of spe-
cial interest in that this is only the second
time in nearly ten years that a team rep-
resented Davidson both members of which
were Sophomores. That these men should
make the varsity this year indicates a bright
future for them in the next two years in
this field of college life.
