As the seats of the Black Box
Theatre gradually filled up, the
gentle notes of a guitar and playful
fiddle set the tone for the Davidson
production of Heathen Valley. For
the next couple of hours, the bril-
liant sound and lighting effects
transformed the room into a primi-
tive North Carolina backwoods in
the 1800s. Here in the so-called
“valley that God forgot,” six char-
acters were thrust into the conflict
between backwoods superstition
and civilized religion. The play
follows the personal quest of the
Episcopal Bishop of North Caro-
lina as he attempts to convert a
valley of poor, simple folk into

' civilized disciples of the Episcopal

Church. The complications arise
when the Bishop himself begins to
question his own connections with
God, and his disillusionment
spreads like wildfire through the
newly-converted valley.

Director Ronnie Higdon suc-
ceeded in his attempt to simply tell
the story of Heathen Valley and to
let the audience interpret the mes-

sage behind the play. The show :

was almost worth seeing just for its

Flanagan gives emotional reading

By Krisy Ford

In conjunction with Health/
AIDS awareness week, Dr. Brenda
Flanagan gave a reading of her
fiction on Tuesday, November 8,
in the Morrison Room. Students
from her Caribbean Literature and
African-American Literature
classes as well as members of the
faculty gathered for refreshments
in an informal setting before the
session began.

Flanagan began by giving the
assembly some background infor-
mation on her life and her family.
As.one of fourteen children, she
was very close to her family, and
in particular her brother Earle. At
the age of ten she cried when she

tackled an appropriate theme for
the talent show: AIDS.

Miles Mowry and John
Seebach did spectacular jobs
with their guitar improvisations.
They played both original songs
and covers.Doris Hermann and
Joe Beach closed the organized
part of the:show with a few
interesting covers from Cat
Stevens and an emotional “Tears
in Heaven” from Eric Clapton.

Well, I was wrong in my
preconceived opinions of talent
shows. I have nothing but good
things to say about these students”
who were willing to share their
abilities to benefit a cause as ~
important as AIDS awareness.
The chance to see more of this
talent is something I look
forward to in the future.

heard her mother say that “only the
good die young.” Even as a youth,
she was convinced her brother
would die because he stood out as
an-exceptional person.

She stood by her brother as he
died of AIDS three years ago.
Moved deeply by her own experi-
ence, she wrote the story entitled
“To Die of Old Age in a Foreign
Country,” which she read on Tues-
day. It was told in the voice of
mothers who must experience the
death of child who is somewhere
else in the world. For the Carib-
bean mother in the story, this is a
very strange death.

Flanagan exuded an overall
presence that captivated the entire

audience. Tears could be seen in
the eyes of several listeners as she
began reading in her Trinidadian
accent. Her reading was quite
emotional and filled with gestures,
such as singing her own version of
“Amazing Grace” inthe story. This
displayed the power of song in the
Caribbean and the need for song in
a time of sorrow. Her story spoke
of the strength of women and their
determination to do what they felt
was right. She also emphasized
strong family bonds and the need
for a proper burial.

Those who missed Flanagan
can hear her read on November 20,
at 3:00 p.m. at the BSC.

technical aspects. From the
celebratory dancing tunes in the
first act to the ominous chanting of
the second act, the sound design
captured the shifting tones of the
play. The lighting was simply stun-
ning; various shades and colors
were used to help create the setting
for each scene, switching from
sunny daytime to starry moonlight.
These technical effects, combined
with perfect costumes and makeup,
a minimalist set design, and
Higdon’s creative blocking and
direction, provided the appropri-
ate backdrop as the actors per-
formed the events of the story.
Unfortunately, Wednesday
night’s performance seemed to
suffer somewhat from a case of
opening night nervousness. Atfirst,
Scott Lenhart’s Starns, one of the
central characters of the play,
seemed particularly strained and
uncomfortable. rane
His strongest moments came
in the second act, particularly in
his final speech to the Bishop and
in his difficult death scene. This

' scene also provided one of Heather

Baldwin’s finest moments in the
play as the whimsical matron fig-
ure Juba.

Two of the strongest perfor-
mances came from Josh Buchanan
as the twisted and simple-minded
Harlan and Valerie Whitlock as

his victimized wife Cora. Both of’

these characters received a lot of
stage time and got to really de-
velop — ‘in contrast with the re-
maining two characters. Ian
Buchanan’s Billy served well as a
narrator and provided acouple bril-
liant comic moments, but other-
wise mainly functioned as a by-
stander. The character of the
Bishop, played as well as possible
by Robert Ramsay, suffered most

The valley that God forgot

from a lack of development. He
disappeared almost as soon as he
arrived in the valley at the begin-
ning of the first act. In the second
act, he finally spent some.time on

‘the stage as he struggled with his

sense of spiritual satisfaction and
his calling in the church. But with-

' out any background, this transfor-

mation came across mainly as just
confusing; the Bishop seemed to
waver constantly between smug
self-righteousness and sincere pi-
ety.

Nevertheless, the play suc-
ceeded in examining the many dif-
ferent responses which different
people have to religion and the
many different needs which reli-
gion fills. The three characters left
standing in the starlight together at ”
the end of the first act represented
three major reactions. The Bishop
sought religion as a means of find-
ing God for himself, for his per-
sonal satisfaction. Starns used re-
ligion to connect with the earth,
with the land and its people; he
tried to find a faith that would
work, a faith that would do some-
thing good for the people of the
valley. For the orphan Billy, reli-
gion provided him with the home
and sense of family that he never
had. The people in the valley
seemed to represent the common
folk, who try to embrace Chris-
tianity by turning it into something
they can understand. Atfirst, Chris-
tianity seemed to meet each
character’s jndividual:needs, but
by the end of the play, the audience
was left only with questions and
problems. :

Heathen Valley successfully
examined both sides of the tre-
mendous power of Christianity —
both the good it can bring and the
damage it can cause.
