THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

We have often had the privilege of
having one or two carnest and inspiring
Christian leaders for a week or ten days
on the Hill, bringing us a message. — But
the opportunity which the Davidson
student body will face next week is one
which very few student bodies ever have,
and one which not many of us will
have in the same way again.

For we are young men, and the chal-
lenge of the Laymen’s Convention in
Charlotte next week will come to us as
it never will later, when we are older
and settled in our professions.

Those who hear fohn R. Mott on
Tuesday night will hear a man who is
recognized as the world’ s greatest Chris-
tian stateman and who is considered by
Woodrow Wilson and others to be the
greatest single personality of his age.
He is the founder and general secretary
of the World’s Christian. Student Fed-
eration, and more than any other man
of his age has had direct and vital con
tact with student life and activities in
every part of the world. He has trav-
eled around the: world three times socak
ings to students in every land. He is
intimately acquainted with student life
and work and always has a message for
the college man. At the Convention
he will speak on “Phe Message of the
Hour.” Dr. Mott has recently return-
ed from Europe, where with — special
letters from the President, he was passed
through the lines and held conferences
with the Christian leaders in Bertin,
Paris, London and other centers. He
has a message, we are told, from these
leaders to the Christian manhood of
America. Let us hear it.

Robert FE. Speer is another of the
master spirits of the religious world
who will speak at the Convention. He
is one of the powerful and effective
speakers to college men in America. He
is a Princeton man, graduated — from
there with honors second only to those
of Aaron Burr, and with an enviable
athletic record. His addresses are pow-
erful messages that grip the hearts of
men,

Then there is W. T. Fllis, the “jour-
nalist of missions:” Dr. Campbell
White, the General Secretary of the
Laymen's Movement, a man of spirit-
ual force and energy, and = our own
friends, Dr. Ogden and Dr. Dobyns.

But what shall we more sav? For
time would fail us to tell of the other
great leaders at the Convention.

We owe it to ourselves. as the future
men and laymen of our Church, and to
our college, which needs the inspiration

of this Convention to attend as many
of its meetings as we are able.

The faculty has opened the way; let
us not fail in this opportunity of a life-

time.

The DAVIDSONIAN. Februery 10, 1915

WHAT DO WE READ?

Mr. George Brett, an experienced
publisher, is the writer of an article in
the Atlantic Monthly for November, en-
titled ‘““The Reading of Books Nowa-
days.” Out_of a full and long experi-
ence, Mr. Brett calls attention to the
present-day decadence in book-reading.

Publishing hotises which have flourish-
ed for twenty years and more, have
been brought to the verge of bankruptcy
because of the failure to sell their stand-
ard books. ‘The decadence has even
reached current literature, and = many
magazines formerly much read have
been suspended or are losing
in their circulation.

Mr. Brett traces three causes for this
decadence. Since 1870, interest has
largely been shifted from higher subjects
pertaining to the knowledge of God and
the study of man, and directed toward
physical and natural science, laboratory
and invention work. ‘The book is be-
‘oming more ‘largely a reference. “The
play clement in education, object lessons

vof pictures, and the constant introduc-

tion of features to please and attract,
iis, secondly,
independence of the reading mind, and
has belittled power. of reflection and
thought. A third influence is the super-
abundance nowadays of light — fiction.
The craze for excitement: which — has
called loudly for the theatre, the movies,
the dance, has also demanded the light
and superficial novel.

In addition to these influences, there
is the business strain and mad rush of
our times. The result is that we are
hecoming a non-reading people, or rather
a people of superficial, careless and un-
thing readers. Reading maketh a full
man; conversation a ready man; and
writing an accurate man. But readiness
and accuracy can be of little service to
the empty man, so a man’s full equip-
ment in sound and good literature 1s at
the foundation of real success. Only a
serious, vital and more profound view
of life than we have in this careless and
amusement-loving time can bring — us
back to our point of departure, the read-
ing ard appreciation of the best litera-
ture. If you read one book, you sacri-
fice reading another. And how much
better to store our treasure-house with
the reading of the books that are im-
mortal and the literature of undying
power!

In college are formed the habits of a
lifetime. “The passing novel, the comic
page, and the sporting sheet have their
slaces. but if the college student of to-
day does not learn to think as well as
to real. ta eniov the Atlantic Monthly
as well as “Life.” Scott and Dickens
and the real thinking modern writers
as much as George Barr McCutcheon.
there is little hope of a change for the
better in the American people asa
whole, and we are on the road to far
worse decadence.

But fet us hope that the pendulum
will swing back, and that the coming
college generation will uplift the stand-
ard of reading and thought in our na-
tion. Thus only will we uplift the
ideals of the nation itself.

INFIRMARY NOTES.

Since the beginning of the year, the
hospital has been well filled almost every
week with students sick with la grippe
and tonsilitis. There are at present four
men in the Infirmary, all of whom are
improving. Several milder cases are re-
ported in the dormitories. L. A. Arm-
stead, who has been quite sick with
pneumonia, is convalescing nicely.

L. P. Smith, of the Freshman class.
injured his arm while exercising in the
outdoor gymnasium last week and went
to Charlotte for an X-Ray examination.
A fractured elbow was found to be the
trouble. It is improving rapidly now.

It might be of interest to state that
Mr. Nolen, landscape architect, in his
plans for the improvement and extension
of the Davidson campus recommends
that a new infirmary with accommoda-
tions for twelve men, be built across the
street from the residence of Mr. Jack-
son. This location is quiet, well-drained
and the exposure excellent.
