In this co-ed day and age,
midwinters can either be a time
of excitement or anguish. It can
be a time when one mixes with

the campus, or when one feels.

alienated from the campus. The
problem lies in the acquisition
of a date—take a chance on a
campus date or import? Back in
the good 'ole—er, the pre-co-ed
days, the problem was none-ex-
istent; the dating situation was
simple and straightforward im-
portation. If you had no outside
connections, you conned your
roommate into getting his date
to drag along a few extra
bodies. Simple, easy, no anx-
iety —just a big time to let it all
rip.

The whole purpose of the big
weekend originally was to pro-
-vide an: occasion for girls to
flood the campus, to provide “‘a
time to break the monotony of
asexual life’’ (Quips and

850 boy-hungry females arriv-

Under normal circumstances,

such a massive undertaking to
house 600 girls in Belk and

NooOOO. These were 600 boy-
crazy girls and they were out to
make a hit or strike out swing-
ing. So when they arrived in the
lobby ‘of Belk to check in, they

’ drug behind them three or four

suitcases full of hairdryers,
curlers; make-up, evening wear,
outdoor wear, indoor wear,
something for every possible
occasion. *‘ You'd think,'’ re-

counts Scotty, “they were go-

ing on a world cruise.”

- Apparently all the imported
equipment was justified in that
during these Davidson week-
ends every possible occasion
was likely to,occur. These were
the only ‘three times during the
year that wine; women, and
song converged on Davidson
and it was only natural, says
Shaw, that the students felt
they “had to make use of the
situation."” After the cocktail
parties, the formal dinners, the
concerts, the parties, the after-

parties, the post-after-parties,

came the big fraternity break-

fasts on Patterson Court.
“We'd come in,” says Sue Ross,
“take a shower, take about a

two-hour nap, and start it .

In her college days at Queens,
Sue Ross was herself one of the

imported dates who frequented
the Davidson big weekend
scene. “‘More than anything,”
she recalls, ‘‘it was a frantically
paced weekend.’’ The action
was hardly limited to the Dav-
idson campus because Davidson
was as void of alcohol as it was
of women. There were picnics
out in the country, and the
individual fraternity parties,
distributed throughout the
night, were also distributed
throughout the territory. ‘“They
wer as far away as Statesville,
Concord, and of course, Char-
lotte,” Sue reports. According
to Scotty there were some
soirees all the way into South
Carolina. Sue says that one of
classes. If it was not the guy
who had to drag himself to

class, it was the girl who had to”

be driven back to her school for
a Saturday quiz. Sue remem-
bers a professor who had an
uncanny knack for assigning
quizzes on Davidson weekends.

“We were convinced that she

consulted a Davidson calendar

before scheduling her tests.”
The action was notonly full

and fast paced, but bizarre. The
