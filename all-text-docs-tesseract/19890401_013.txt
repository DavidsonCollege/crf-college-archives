Athletic issues grip
campus in the thirties

Will joining the Southern Conference sacrifice

Davidson's academic integrity? |

YSSC, debate club, fraterni-
ties, chapel, classes, and
athletics crowd the pages of
Davidsonians from the 1930's.
Ornate headlines list the
newest debate club officers.
Interesting speakers for the
mandatory chapel meetings
expand their moralities once
again. Emotional articles
bring the tremendous athletic
victories of the 30’s into the
present.

The 1930's began with a
bang as the June 7 commence-
ment ceremonies saw both the
dedication of the ‘new’
Chambers building in addi-
tion to the inauguration of
President Lingle. The men

who attended Davidson
during this time found their
lives wrapped up in such
issues as whether freshman
were paying proper respect to
upperclassmen and the
formation of Sigma Phi Epsi-
lon from one of the many
social clubs.

Clubs formed a large part of
campus life. The international
relations club, the music club,
the drama club and the debate
club heavily involved stu-
dents. A club existed for
every activity, every talent.
The YSSC, a huge organiza-
tion, had Davidson men
teaching Sunday School and
helping out in the commu-

nity.

Athletics
also played
a large partin

Davidson life dur-
ing the early 30’s. In 1933 bas-
ketball had an exceedingly

‘successful year, coming out

high in the big five ranking
which included Wake, Duke,
State and Carolina. Victories
over State ring through ~
Davidsonian pages, although
beating Duke signified a
special occasion. The fresh-
men were required to see
Davidson sports through thin
and thick.

In the latter
half of the
1930's, athletic

policy became an impor-
tant issue. There was contro-
versy over joining the South-
ern Conference, which offered
Davidson a bid in 1936. Stu-
dents, faculty and administra-
tion divided on whether the
conference would harm
Davidson’s stance on the non-
commercialization of athletes.
Many felt that if Davidson
joined the conference, aca-
demic integrity would be
sacrificed for a place in the
winners’ circle. Equally

* Opposed were those who

insisted that the conference
only held greater opportunity
for Davidson athletics. As a
result of the widely publi-
cized proposals circulated by
Dr. Frank Grahams, Davidson
eventually joined the confer-
ence.

On June 7, 1937, the college

. celebrated its 100th year. The

Centennial pageant spanned
three periods of the school’s

past history. It focused on the’

prehistoric era, the college’s
past, and the future. When

students returned in the fall,
one of the largest controver-

“Two of our
students have been
required to withdraw from
our college for transporting
intoxicating liquor and
another large group of
students has been required to
disband their organization,”
wrote Dr. Sentelle in The
Davidsonian. Due to this
incident the faculty cut the
number of general dances to
four, allowed each fraternity
only one party and cancelled
the costume ball. Students
arose in anger. Finally, a com-
promise was reached with the
formation of a committee of
21 members to enforce
Davidson’s laws concerning
the illegality of alcohol
consumption.

Thé 30’s ended well for The
Davidsonian. For the first time
in 24 years The Davidsonian,
edited by Dick Vowles, won
All-American standing from
the National Scholastic Press.
Only 28 papers in the county
received this honor. The Press
commented on The
Davidsonian’s extraordinary
news coverage as well as their
use of cuts. Throughout the
