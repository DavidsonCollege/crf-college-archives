“He has shown ‘unlimited

patience with his detractors, .

who. have been harsh and

that I haven’t had an. opportu-
‘nity to have my say,’ said
' Physical Plant Director Grover
Meetze.

“I think that he’s not active
enough with the students on
camus. I don’t think he’s very
personal,” said one junior girl.

There are other views, of ©
course, many others. But per- |

hpas a quicker way to learn

about Spencer’s personality”
would be to look at a few -

biographical facts.

The son of a South Carolina
banker, Spencer is 59 years
old—husband to one woman

and father to four children.
' In an age which/often consi-
ders going to church more a
sign of hypocrisy than good-
ness, Spencer still maneges to
find his way to a pew most
Sunday mornings.

He is author of two books,

Decision for War 1917 ‘and.

Booker T. Washington and the
Negro’s Place in American Life,
neither of which has made him
famous.

He graduated from Davidson

himself in 1940, after:serving as.~

Managing Editor of The David-
sonian and President of the
Student Body.

’ Like a lot of other people, he
fought in World War II; unlike
a lot of other people, he not only
got out alive but went on to get

a Ph.D. degree from Harvard.
He was President of Mary
Baldwin, the Presbyterian wo-
men’s college in Staunton, Vir-
ginia, for about 10-years before

coming to Davidson.

He claims to be a very private
man; abhors having flattering
newspaper stories come out
about him; and confinded to a
Charlotte observer reporter a-
bout two years ago that he
never did quite figure out what

he wanted to do with his life.
And, whatever his detractors

might say to the contrary, he is
also an extraordinarily success-

ful Davidson College President.

with one decade of work to
prove it.

‘From traveling around, I
know he is held in high regard
at other liberal arts colleges like

Davidson. Key péoph- toc v-
pon him as a very sucessful

college president,” said Chem-
istry Department Chairman
Nicholas Burnett.

“He’s got a record that will
stand up under scrutiny,’
Burnett added.

Soon after Spéncer took office
in 1968, he set up five commit-
tees to study some of the
college’s lingering problems.

Saying ‘I come to Davidson
not as its chief defender but as
its chief critic,” Spencer set up
a Commission on Co-education.

“Let us once and for all take
it out of the realm of vague
speculation and get the facts
necessary for a decision as to its
desirability and feasibility,’’
Spencer charged the members.

Four years later, in 1972,
Davidson formally became a

- co-educational college.. Just a

few months after the move, The
Davidson Update began brag-
ging that a lot more students
were applying to come to Da-
vidson.

The total number of students
was upped from approximately
1000 to 1300 to incorporate the
new-found women; few com-
plained.

He set up a Commission on
Social Patterns, asking, ‘How

| can the college best fulfill its
. responsibility to offer construc-

tive social outlets and oppor-
tunities on an equal basis to all
its students?

“What is the place of frater-
nities in such a program and a
genuinely critical study cannot
begin with the automatic as-
sumption that they must have a
place.’’

A few years later the self-se-
lection system was set up,
almost everyone complained,
and some fraternities even left
Patterson Court.

Today, Sig Eps still talk with
bitterness about the way Spen-
cer is said to have handled the
matter.

But however the matter was
handled, today there seems to
be a quiet consensus that the
move_was a good one.

Certainly, it is a kinder one.

He set up a Commission on
Church Relationships, saying
“We used to think of church
relations in terms of rules,

regulations about church atten-
—

dences. Students today are for
more interested in the essence of
the Christian faith as a cure for
individual social ills.

“We want to find out how to
gear the church relationship to
that level,’”’ said Spencer.

Colored with anti-semitism,
the story reached as far as the
front page of the Washington
Post. Spencer denied that pre-
judice had anything to do with
the decision, citing insubordi-
nation instead.

Nevertheless, the pressure
resulting from the protest
forced the Board of Trustees to
scrap Davidson’s controversial
tenure requirement —all tenured
professors no longer needed to
be Christian:*(Some say it still
helps.)

In the spring of 1976, a
number of students and profes-
sors boycotted Davidson’s
Spring Convocation in protest
of Spencer’s decision to rescind
a job offer to a Jewish profes-
sor.

Whatever the committee de-
cided, and whatever changes
were made, it was from this area
that-the major crises of Spen-
cer’s first decade arose.

When first asked to comment
on Spencer’s achievements and
failures, the philosophy profes-
sor who had a large part in
engineering the protest said,
“Sure, I’m not chicken.”

But then Dr. Earl MacCor-
mac, often mentioned as the
administration’s most outspo-
ken critic on campus, missed
two appointments he had sche-
duled to talk about Spencer.

Davidson’s Christian Com-
mittment is still a sore spot of
controversy.

In 1968, Spencer also set up a
Commission on Extra-Campus
Responsibilities, saying,
southern colleges ‘‘have been
incredibly myopic is viewing the
specific needs of a region
plagued for a century by prob-
lems of racial discrimination,
economic deprevation, and cul-
tural malnutrition.” ;

On October 12, 1968, exactly
10 years ago today, Spencer
announced in the Charlotte
Observer that he would try to
