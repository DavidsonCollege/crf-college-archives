THE DAVIDSONIAN O PINI O N S MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1994

Pethaps she had always known
she was a lesbian. Perhaps she
fabricated stories of love with all
the handsome guys she dated and
laughed inside herself at all of us
who foolishly believed her. Or
maybe she cried inside each time
she betrayed herself. The crying
seems more likely. If so, we be-
trayed her by making her believe
we wouldn’t accept the truth.

I found out a year after she
moved away. She came back to
visit with her long, beautiful brown
hair cropped into a short page boy.
I was startled by her hair, but even
more startled when I learned that
she was visiting to let us know she
was a lesbian.

Noone wasangry or disgusted,
or perhaps we didn’t dare be angry
or disgusted. Instead, we all sat in
silence, disturbed that we had been
so blind to whom she really was
and perhaps guilty that we had not
helped her to find herself. Words
were carefully chosen when we
spoke of it after she returned to her
new home. Some of us were both-
ered, but none of us dared speak it.

Ignorance can
be betrayal.

We went along our routines, stop-
ping only to cringe when we over-
heard gay jokes or AIDS reports.

There was a desire within all
of us to be fair and accepting.
Maybe we wouldn’t have reacted
this way to another homosexual,
but it hit home now, and it was our
time to learn. Our world had anew
perspective—one that made us feel
odd and uncomfortable at times,
but one that had to be dealt with.

The greatest barrier came this
past New Year’s Eve. AsI sat with
old friends, we recalled the days of
Deborah’s coming out. She was in
San Francisco with her lover, and
perhaps that is why someone fi-
nally spoke these words. My best
friend, Erica, looked at me, and I
could tell she was dying to say
what was on her mind.

“1 don’t. know how you can’t
be bothered by all the overnights

T deSmitel, dott thnk
thy shald be
iven equal ri

that al otters Were

you two had. It’s fine if she’s gay.
But don’t you feel betrayed?”

I shook my head no. We had
come to the unspoken consensus
that the only way to deal with the
news was to accept it. It would be
too difficult for Deborah if we sec-
ond guessed. her; she didn’t de-
serve a trial. +

Deborah’s best friend stared
at Erica, and I could tell that one of
the things we had never dared to
whisper was about to be vocalized.
I sat, wishing I could escape this
politically correct facade that
masked our internal questions. I
couldn’t help but feel we had to
accept it for what it was.

She said, “I guess you don’t
want to know you were the one
who made Deborah realize she was
a lesbian. She had such strong
feelings for you, romantic feel-
ings. She had to accept it. You

changed her life.” Erica stared
straight ahead and the room fell
silent.

I had to speak. “You should
be flattered. She didn’t expect to
date you; she found you attractive
and thought you were fun to be
around. You changed her life. If
you hadn’t, she’d still be strug-
gling. It’s a compliment.”

I left the room in frustration.
Erica’s struggle came from our
ignorance of the issue. We had
chosen to ignore everything ex-
cept that our friend was a lesbian.

Perhaps we are the reason
Deborah is now in San Francisco.
Did we make her feel she had to
run and hide? If so, as her child-
hood friends, we tried too hard to
be tolerant and we failed by alien-
ating her. Now, we can only sec-
ond guess our actions as we pain-
fully realize the correct way to deal
with homosexuality is to under-
stand and accept it, rather than
tolerate it as part of the vastness of
sexuality. And the betrayal of a
friend should never come solely
from ignorance.

"Bathing suit paranoia syndrome" strikes Davidson.

An, yes, spring in Davidson is
returning. I know this not only
because the birds are chirping, the
trees are budding, and the flowers
are blooming, but mostly because
of the talk I’ve been hearing on
campus. Do the two words “spring
break” sound familiar?

How do you feel when you
hear those words—excited with
the anticipation of a great time
away from Davidson, or perhaps
fear of publicly displaying those
few extra pounds you brought back
with you from the Christmas holi-
days?

Personally, Iam not much ofa
calendar or weekly planner fanatic
and, thus, had not been fully aware
of how few weeks we have until
spring vacation.

I became informed about the
return of spring simply by opening-
my ears.

I first heard comments last
week in aerobics when several
freshman girls were moaning about

their newly acquired “beer bellies.”
They all made vows to work extra
hardat toning up their bodies in the
next few weeks.

I have decided to label this
anguish “Bathing Suit Paranoia
Syndrome” (or BSPS). Though
BSPS normally affects only young
women, I was surprised to learn
that some young men on campus
are also suffering from this conta-
gious disease.

In fact, several senior guys
were consoling each other late one
night after a court party about why
they should go to bed rather than
fulfill their cravings for late night
munchies at the Union Outpost.
They, too, expressed their concern
for trimming up those few inches
that were hanging over their belts.
In fact, one of those guys has even
been spotted running daily. Ididn’t
think he even knew where the track
was!

If you haven’t caught BSPS,
you probably will as soon as you

flip your calendar from February
to. March and see the big words
looming at the end of the month.

As a caring individual who
wants to serve the Davidson com-
munity, I thought I would pass on
a few pieces of advice on how to
find relief from this disease—go
some place cold where you don’t
have to wear a bathing suit.

If you have already made res-
ervations down south and feel
BSPS slowly approaching, then
listen up. (Some of this advice is
serious and some is not...you can
take what you want and discard the
rest.)

(1) Skip that tenth beer when
you are partying. Come on, you
don’t really need it.

(2) If you can’t possibly fol-
low step number one and dochoose
to down that 10th beer, dance extra
hard while drinking it with the
intention of burning it off. Just
think, with the right attitude, court
parties have the potential to be as

We should remain intentionally influenced by a tradition.

decreases diversity>»On the one
_hand are fine educational institu-
tionsin which the life of the spirit—
as expressed in any traditional, re-
ligious way—is marginalized. On
the other hand are institutions
where a particular brand of Chris-
tianity has become a straightjacket
that cripples the search for truth
and the development of character.
I wonder to myself: could
Davidson promote genuine diver-
sity in higher education by seeking
to be a place where one can be a
genuine believer or searcher (or
better yet, both) and also be a genu-
ine intellectual, where onecan have

the opportunity to develop one’s
whole self with integrity (i.e., in an
integrated way)? I think that’s a
genuine possibility if we continue
to understand our identity within a
Christian framework, which may
mean requiring that trustees be
members of a Christian church.
To require that trustees be
Christians is symbolically to af-
firm that we value the origin of the
spiritual values and that we intend
to keep them as an integral part of
the life of this institution for gen-
erations to come, for the sake of
all, Christians and non-Christians
alike. {havea feeling that that kind
of symbolism is very important.
Therefore, in this case, it might

seem the best thing to do, both to
others and to ourselves, to remain
intentionally influenced by a tradi-
tion which undergirds spiritual
values, which demands justice,
campassion, and humility.

The downside, of course, is
that those qualified non-Christians
mentioned above are excluded
from the board of trustees. Is that
negative consequence worth ac-
cepting in order to hold on to the
positive possibilities of holding fast
to the guidance that comes from
the Christian tradition? That’s at
least part of the decision before the
trustees as they consider this policy.

strenuous as aerobics or jogging.

(3) Skip the late night
Domino’s delivery or journey to
the Union Outpost. You can save
your money to blow on spring
break!

(4) Hey lazy bums, don’t drive
to class. The walk isn’t that far.
Though I don’t have any data to
back this up, I would imagine on
average, you can burn 20 calories
every time you walk to Chambers.
If you did this twice a day, in four
weeks you could burn 1000 calo-
ries! Not bad for sucha short walk,
huh?

(5) Skip the elevator at Cham-
bers. Unless you have a handicap
or are on crutches, I see no reason
why anyone has to take an elevator
in a three-story building.

I hope that my few tidbits of
advice will help decrease the nega-
tive symptoms of BSPS. I thought
about starting a counseling hot line
to aid those in distress, but I’m
hoping that this article will suffice.

I’ve been at Davidson long
enough to know that the syndrome
will become more obvious in the
next few weeks.. Though the
aerobics classes at present have
plenty of space, a week before
spring break, we will all be elbow
to elbow and drenched in sweat
because of the extra bodies
crammed in one room.

The funny part of it all is that
the week after spring break, most
people will hide themselves under
their clothes again and go back to
their old habits of snacking and
skipping daily exercise.

If you have already been af-
fected by BSPS, my only consola-
tion for you is that all symptoms
will be alleviated in less than one
month.

Reflections on
pride and humility

I love myself. I am the most
unique person in the world. No
one views life in the same way I do.
No one has experienced the same
combination of sorrow and joy
which I have.

Admit it; we have all said
something like this to ourselves at
some point in our lives. We have
either said it consciously or sub-
consciously. Either we take pride
in our accomplishments or we take
pride in the uniqueness of our par-
ticularhuman tragedy. Usually we
do a little of both.

So what is pride? Pride is the
fact that, as I write this article, lam
yearning for people to like it and
compliment me on it. Pride is the
insistence on having my own way
and that my particular subjective
viewpoint is not only unique, but
the correct view. If I thought some-
one else’s viewpoint were correct,
then I would obviously adopt their
view or at least integrate it some-
how with my previously deter-
mined “correct” view of life. Does
this sound familiar? It should,
because we are all guilty of pride-
ful claims such as these.

So what can we say about this
pride which seems to be so intrin-
sic to the human condition? When
I started talking about this subject
with one of my friends, she looked
at me quizzically and said, “Rob,
you really need to relax and get out
a little more!” After a beer, I
started thinking about pride again.

First of all, is pride necessar-
ily a bad thing? C.S. Lewis claims
that pride is the greatest sin be-
cause it is insidious and makes us
turn away from God and rely only
on ourselves. We take the place of
God. Pride can thus turn the holi-
est of saints into the vilest of sin-
ners with the blink of an eye. Oh,
how we loathe the people who are
cocky or self-righteous or, worse
yet, the people whose views are
diametrically opposed to our own.

Pride, however, is alsoused in
conjunction with positive terms like
dignity and self-respect, as the title
of the U2 song written about Mar-
tin Luther King implies. This type
of pride can’t be the same pride
which C.S. Lewis condemns. To
help clear up this mess, please al-
low metoramble onailittle further.

Ihave noticed that whenever I
intentionally try to be humble by
downplaying or underestimating
my own abilities, I end up patting
myself onthe back and saying,
“Good job, Rob! You are soooo
humble!” Such humility is much
worse than the most blatant out-
ward shows of pride.

No, to be truly humble is not
to draw attention to one’s own
“humility.” To be truly humble is
to openly and accurately acknow!l-
edge one's weaknesses and
strengths. We must try toimprove
these weaknesses through honest
introspection, prayer, and a delib-
erate effort on our part. Our
strengths should be used boldly,
and given their due credit, but we
should not dwell on them for too
long. Only through such a balance
can we truly and. humbly stand
with pride.
