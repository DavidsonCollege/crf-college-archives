Don’t Stop Now

With the trustees' favorable roie-
thon to the Blue Skv Conintitiee’s re-
tort, Dean Johnstoa’s aptiniam con:
cerning ihe possibility of reforming
the college's curriculum svems no
longer merely “blue-skying.” The
committee report offers the kind of
liberal edveational outlook which will
enable Davidson ta move itself info
the future with anticipation of better
competition with the best thhernl arts
institutiong.

The committee made sumerous
spovific proposals which are exciting
enough to warrant implementation by
next fall Flawever. there seems to be
a danger that, having met with the
trustees concerning their report on
cerriculum., the Blie Sky Commilt-
we's work may be thought virtually
completed.

The report discussed by the
trustees’ Educational Committee was

submitted last May as a “progress re-
pari” of the Sky Committee, and
while discussing the “main strechurnl
features” of the new curriculum, if
dict not pretend to be the final word
from the committee. The conspicucus
nisence of any comment an the Stu-
ent Life Subcommittee’s report tn-
dicntes that the parent commitico’s
May report should by no means be
considered the comprehensive prer
posal from the committee.

Because of the amount of data the
committee is handling, all subeoin-
mittee reports should be treated and
reporied upon when the commitiee
releases its final recommendatians.

To allow the later reports to die.

Without the examination and pubdlictty
accorded to those released in the first
report would be the exact kind of
fourel-resting from which Davidson is
trying {0 escape.

Dangerous Move

A quick look at the college calendar
for the academic year 1987-2068 re-
veals the startling information that
lasses begin after the Christmas holi-
days on January 2. For those not
grasping the importance of this fact.
this means students must return to
school on New Year’s Day—the day
after New Year's Eve.

For the student returning to Da-
vidson from Mooresville or Concord
or Chariatte, this will not prove too
great a hardship. The thought of re-
turning in the late afternoon or eve-
ning of January 1 is only slightly ag-
pravating.

it is a different story for the student
returning from farther away, some-
one who must spend all day—or more
—traveling, leaving very early on the
first of January. To leave for a tiring
drive of severa) hundred miles after
only a couple af hours sleep following
a New Year's Eve Party is no pleasant
—or safe—prospect,

We urge whoever determines the
official college calendar to exercise
all of his or their efforts to extend
the Chrisimas vacation one day in
order to guarantee a less dangerous
return to Davidson for those students
who must travel a long distance.

Profitable Service

Married students at Davidson arte
not being turned out into the cold
harsh world without a roof over their
heads. The statement by Mrs. Peter
Nicholls, dorm supervisor, that hous:
ing for married students has decreased
does not mean that there is none avail-
able.

Those who are advocating that the
college build housing for married
students are basing their contention
an the fact that, while roofs can be
found by all of the married students,
the places available are often little
more than that—just roofs. Jackson
Heights, the group of apartments that
shelters most of these students, has
earned ihe name “Cardboard Village”
because of ite thrown-together cun-
struction.

President DB. Grier Martin had a
stroke of genius back when he was
serving as trevsurer of the college.
He proposed that the college joan
rooney fram its endowment to facully
members far the purpose of home
construction. This plan enabled fac-
ulty members to create satisfactory
honsing where there was none anil
the Inturest rate on the leans produced
income for the college. Other colleges
across line country have since adopted
thiz plan.

Whon Patterson Fraternity Court

was constructed, a vatiailon af this.

pisn was tsed. Money for tae project
wens taken from the enclowment; sow
it carps more money each year ns cach
frateroity member pave a housing fee
that represents iscame for the en-
dowment,

4 similar approach could be wsed
to provitte housing for married st-
donts. It is more important for this
housing to be functional than luxur-
ious. But the inclusion of some of the
Intier quality would make an gpart-
ment building built by the college
much more attractive to the students
than cramped quarters now avaliable.

It would probably be impossible

far ithe college to charge enough in
rent to pay for the ding in the
next few ‘years. Even sa, such an apart:
ment building would serve ss a long:
range source of income for the col-
lege.

No one can tell whether or not the
present fad of getting married while
in college will conthnue. Therefore,
it would be impossible for the college
to attempt to house all married stu-
dents in such a building. But at least
the project would relieve some of the
pressure for housing among married
students and give many of them a
respectable place to live.

Pacesetter?

Just in case the usual prophecies
of doom from THE DAVIDSONIAN
have convinced anvene that the cal-
lege & hopelessly sunk in the Dark
Ages. an encouraging note has been
heared from the state's hotbed of radi-
calisin at Chapel Hill

Qver at the University of North
Carolina al Chapel Hill, where the
freshmen demonstrate thelr virility
by sprouting beards instead of danning
heanies. the studen! newspaper, The
Paily Tar Heel, has lonked wistfully
upon the liberality of Davidson,

Tr a Bept. 24 edftorial condenming
tactal disvriminatien by fraternities,
The Daily Tar Heel said, “Unfortun-
aely, if a Carolinn fraternity does
take a Negro, it won't be the first
campus in thts state on which this has
happened. Negroes have pledged at
both Wake Forest University and Da-
vidson College.

“Which is maybe even more of a
reason for doing it: ta egich up with
the rest of the 20th Century.”

TE is really too bad that Davidson
cannat olfer some token of sympathy.

Public Utility

A Wildcat Handbook is a Wildeat
Hanribook, Almost anything with 1
few bazice will serve ils purpose-—to

wopercinssmen aud facelty members.
Tt tues something really outstundip

special notice, and thai is what the ‘67
version of the Hondbank is not.

It contains the names, addresses
and pictures of most of the freshinen
talthegl several pictures are miss
ingi and Richardson sebotars (atthough
ane was completely omitted). The Fac-
ulty Regulations appear on ensy-to-
find blue poges. The Student Body

Constitution unfortunalely dacs not:
it was left out.

A few sapects of the pahiiention.
serve ta mark if clearly of the 1967
aiiting., particularly the comment on
enrricnlum revision. The exsssy enti
Ued “Education: ‘Poet’ and ‘Architec-
tore’ ™ alifouph anenymous was also
a positive additinn.

None of this 35 intended tn indicate

ore: they did not, The book would

it remains a good reference soures

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Nationals’ Proposal Best,
Directed To Real Problem

Dear Enlitor:

Perhaps sume of the opin:
jonas in last week"s editorial,
“No Solution.’ can be. viewed
in o different Light.

The statement, which, in
talking about the system pro-
posed by the national frater-
nity offices, sald in part,
“They shrouled their tejec:
tion in a resoiulion that just
fails to accomplish the same
gonls that the fraternity pres-
idents «ere alming for,”’ is
-misheading-

Meat people know thal
tha ‘fgeal” [he presidents
were siming for wos thet
af simply ateying on cam-
pes, When fecod with the
choles of adopting mest ef
the feculty’s proposals or
losing thelr charters, they
chase tho former. Most peo-
ple recognized thie as a
*tehatgun wodding” accept-
ance.

Also, the statement that
lwo nationals “refused to rec:
ognize the status of social at
filiate’ was canfusing. The
nationals imay mat have rec:
ognized the status of n social
avfitiate, bul they scemed ta
be acutely aware of the sta.
tus of what, under the 1m
pending system. will be an
unwanted member. Huw does
a club give a fair ehance to
an unwanted member?

Qur problem must he re-
o¥atunled on a “veaet’’ Dnsia.
Fltihees Jacking bids were
adenply unwanted at dhe tee

by a system based on indi.
viduols’ desires for mutuol
voluntmry association and
brotherhood.

The obvious problems con-
cern the missimpressions of
froternities and rushecs and
the Jack af time to reconcile
these differences.

Tiree proposal by the na-
tionats seemed to be directed
toward the real problem.
That iz, instead of a compul-
sory aystem which arbitrar-

ily naaigns the unbidded boys
to strange housen, let them
have ancther Joo nt pros-
pective Nouses and another
chance at membership.

By this plan, the mutual
need and want of boy for club
will be satisfied,

No rushee will be secepted
by compulsion or will feel
that he has been.

All will be bliss.

Solution Offered

Dest Editor:

Your editorial on Rep.
George Brown wan hesed on
incomplete reporting. At the
coffee hour Brown did offe:
his propased solution in 2
four-step program for peace:

1. “A complete cease-fire—
stopping the bombing and
halting offensive operations
_. 1 Dut continuing defensive
operations,"

2. “For the Peesident of the
United States to ask for an
tmmediate reconvening, of the
Geneva Conferenee, sviuich
would be better than the U.N.
... because the only shred
of international Tow ip that
arey was created by the Ge-
nmeyn Conference,”

3. “Ta go in and necotinte
for ne parpane a condition
innder which the Sadth Viet-

namese people could clect a
truly representative govern
ment,”

4. “An international, en-
ee ‘gon guarantee that the
government would not
overthrown by violence.”*

4 m press conference lat.
er, Brown vowed to “do his
damndest” toe help field a
Callfarnia delegation to the
Democratic Sational Conven-
tion “so committed to using
alt their afforts to change
our Vietnam policy that they
will inke every passible step
to din that—even absteining
from voting Tor Jolhnson or
walking aut and picketing the
cmivention.’

‘Return To Normalcy

1 was lying on my bed Tuesday afternoon, doing
nothing but contemplating my navel, when it sudden-
ly occurred to me that it was the last day that I could

et my annual picture made. Oh boy, thought I, a re-

irn to the glorious traditions of yesteryear, a return
to the good old days when everybody gets to have his
picture made with coat and tie, a return to the good
old tradition of o straight, plastic yearbook.

So thinking, I arose, donned my psychedelic
cravat, plus a suit coat, and set out for the Union,
where the photographs were to be taken. Not finding
any windmills along the way at which to tilt, I arrived
without offending anyone nor rocking any boats.

Upon entering the building, my eyes were met
with a long Hine of Davidson gentlemen, waiting to
have their pictures made. The situation looked grim,
but my state of depression lifted when once again it
occurred to me that this year we weren't going to be
subjected to the kind of hippy, weird Quips and
Cranks that was produced last year.

Last year’s yearhonk didn’t even have any of that
sparkling prese which usually chronicles the year’s
activities. | missed the power, the vitality that usually
informs a college/high school annual, Just think what
we inight be able to get this year, now that we've gone
back to the old-fashioned kind of yearbook:

1967-68 was a year of change for Davidson
College. New committees wero farmed, new clubs
were organized, and the student body, after ask-
ing Deon Burts’ permission, asserted its power.
Controversy reigned: violent arguments arose
over the changod laundry ond finen sarvice, the
rise in Union snack bar prices was passionately
discussed, Bul through It all stolidty stood, as
Glivaltar the tiorm, ready to face the world—the
senior.

Now that's the kiad af thing 1 want to read in an
anooal, | can do without these depressing pictures of
mud puddles and dormitery johas,

My hopes now aroused by the thougat of what the
yearbook could be in this. my senior year, | willingly
picked up the little card you irave to fill out in order
LO get your picture made. | filled in the raquasted En-
formation, cor¢iul not io press my pen too strong
on the card, so as net to bend, fold, or mutilate it. (1
must confess, however, Usat 1 did consider spindling
ihe thing.)

‘Te kill the time, 1 exchanged a coupte of sacrileg-
ious jokes with somebody, but the wait stil! soemed
lengthy. Finally, my turn came. and I had my picture
mane to the jacring ef several onlookers.

Having spent so much time to get the mug shot,
i feel that it is wall within my provinee to suggest o
few changes {rom lust year’s yearbook, in order that
we may effectively return to the tradition of pre
DwelleThelian anouals.

Firat, let's put athletics back in its proper place.
1 suggest full-page photos af Coaches Diesel) and
Smith, preferably ginssy, together with half page pic:
tures of all the olfer nameless mussrs. In ihe new
action P.E. department. Kilge’s pielure in there
wouldn't hurt.

Seeondly, lul/s put fraternities back where the
belong. We ‘nevd pictures of ail the ,brofhera, both
individually and en masse, plus piclures of cach of the
houses. And, of course, it wouldn't be 2 Quips and
Cranks without those cute little enigmatic statements,
{he imeoning of which only the brothers leew fer sure,

1 Finally, all the non-essential elements of the col-
lege really necd no representation in the yearbook, |
suggest that the [acuity be left out entirely, and that
nly ihe clubs which mean something to the Wfe of
the campus be left in. Thus, for example, the Phi
Bales really need no recognition, but it would be nice

to have n picture of ‘
whatever tint is, all the guys in the Beaver Club,
