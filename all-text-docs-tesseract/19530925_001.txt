CONSTRUCTION WORK|"y’

OR BELK DORMITORY
TO BEGIN SHORTLY

Construction on the new $700,-
000 W. H. Belk Hall will begin in
the very near future, according to
a@ recent statement by Dr. Cun-
ningham.

More than three hundred stu-
dents will be able to be housed in
this new dormitory that will be
constructed between Watts and
West in the area which the ROTC
Building now occupies.

Thompson and Street, contrac.
tors of Charlotte, have set a com-
pletion date of late next year for
the building.

Dr. Cunningham said the new
structure would be named the
W. H. Belk Hall in consideration
of the long service of the late
Charlotte business executive as
the senior trustee of Davidson and
of the gifts of his family and busi-
ness associates.

In naming the néw structure the
W. H. Belk Hall, Davidson is rec-
ognizing one of its most faithful
and loyal trustees in its history.

The late W. H. Belk, founder of
the Belk Department Store organ-
ization, served as a trustee at Da-
vidson almost constantly from
1928 until his death last year.

Davidson awarded Mr. Belk an
honorary Doctor of Laws degree
during the 1950 commencement

Cabinet Sponsors
Blood Drive Soon

Blood Drive to be held
October 7 and 8 is being sponsored
for the fall semester on the cam-
pus by the YMCA. Blood is needed
now as always even though the
Korean crisis has subsided. Be-
sides the usual need for routine
transfusions, there is an urgent
need to refill the blood banks
which were drained last summer
during the polio siege.

Now that gamma globulin is be-
Heved to be a temporary immunity
to polio the blood donor program
has an almost unparalleled need
for blood. Last summer the gam-
ma globulin supply was not large
enough to meet demands and only
critical areas could inoculate their
youth.

One of those areas was in Wes-
tern North Carolina. In other less
serious areas there were instances
of picketing in an attempt to get
gamma globulin.

The Davidson student body ‘has
always vigorously supported the
drive. It is held twice each year
with a different campus organiza-
tion sponsoring it.

Definite organizational plans for
the drive will be made this Sun-
day, September 27th, when the
YMCA cabinet retreats to the
Cumberland Presbyterian Lodge

for the day.

term.

A native of Leota, Minn., he re-
ceived the B.S. degree from the
University of Pittsburgh, master’s

NEWELL TO PREACH
AT SUNDAY VESPERS

This week's speaker for the Sun-
day night Vesper Services is a
familiar figure around the David-
son campus. The Rev. Samuel W.
Newell has been a member of the
college faculty since assuming the
duties of the pastor of the College
Church last March.

A former Davidson student, Rev.
Newell came to the Davidson cam-
pus from Mullins, S.C., where he
was pastor of the Mullins Presby-
terian Church. Born in Jackson,
Miss., in 1917, Newell entered Da-
vidson in 1935 and was graduated
in 1989. While at Davidson he was
an outstanding student in the
classroom and in extra-curricular
activities.

In addition to other offices,
Newell was vice president of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, a member of
the YMCA Board of Control, and
president of his senior class.

After graduation from Davidson,

he taught English for two years at
Battleground Academy in Frank-
lin, Tenn. After leaving B.G.A. he
entered Emory University in At-
lanta, Ga., where he received his
Master’s Degree in English in
1942.

From 1943-46 he was in the In-
telligence Service of the Army. In
the fall of 1946 he entered Union
Theological Seminary in  Rich-
mond, Va. While there he estab-
lished an outstanding record, being
chosen president of the Student
Body. He received his Bachelor of
Divinity degree in 1949.

Just recently Rev. Newell com-
pleted his thesis for a Doctor of
Theology Degree at Union. He
will receive the degree in June
of 1954, With the acquisition of
this honor, Newell will have com-
piled the enviable sum of four
degrees, an A.B., M.A., B.D., and
a Th.D.

Freshmen Cringe
As Court Opens

Fred Stowe, judge of the Court
of Control, announced Wednesday
that the court will open 1953 ses-
sions next Friday in chapel with
the issuing of subpoenas to frosh
violators, who will be tried the fol-
lowing Monday night.

The seven stern-faced members
of the court were introduced to
the not-so-humble freshmen Wed-
nesday morning after chapel. In
explaining the court's purposes
and procedures, Stowe told the
freshmen, “You may think the
court is only a joke organization,
but the things the court will en-
force will help to make you a
better Davidson man.”

The Court of Control works un-
der the auspicies of the Student
Council, being established by an
amendment to the Constitution in
1923. Its purpose is to deal with
charges made by upperclassmen
against freshmen.

Those convicted by the court are
sentenced with penalties, usually
flunky-work for student organiza-
tions.

So far, three freshmen have been
reported to the court as a result of
a recent hat check in assembly.

Regular meetings are scheduled
for Friday mornings in assembly
with judgments to be held Mon-
day nights in the Phi Hall court-
room.

Members of this year's court in-
clude Bill Shipley, Bill Nelson, Dan
McCall, Harry Petersen, Frank
Mitchener, Dickie Adams, Jim
Shelton, and Judge Fred Stowe.

Ga.; James G. Martin, Columbia,
S.C.; Alvin P. Perkinson, Jr., Chat-
tanooga, Tenn., and Ernest Taylor,

Spivak, billed as “the man who
plays the sweetest trumpet in the
world,” will play from nine until
one for the formal dance Friday
night. The informal on Saturday
will last from eight to twelve.

Featured vocalists with Spivak’s
orchestra are lovely Eileen Rod-
gers and baritone Joe Tucker.

Spivak, who played for the Mid-
winters Dances here last year, is
the musician whose fresh and
original idiom in trumpet playing
is described as “honey in the.
horn.” He is the leader of a great
all-time band which rocketed to
topflight stature so rapidly that
it now ranks among the kings if
the enteftainment world.

Notches in Spivak’s musical belt
are 20th Century Fox’s “Pin-Up
Girl,” starring Betty Grable, and
“Follow The Boys” for Universal
and a flock of box office records
created at the Paramount in New
York, The Hotel Statler in New
York, the Palladium in. Holly-
wood, and other top spots. Spivak's
‘music-making is so solidly estab-
lished for its individuality that it
ean be identified whenever and
wherever it is played as “indubita-
bly Charlie's.’

Born in New Haven, Connecti-
cut, Spivak got his first trumpet
while still in grade school: a tiny
instrument with the first valve
practically on top of Charlie’s
nose. He went to Hill House
School in New Haven, studying the
trumpet on his own time with
George Hyer, who is a member of
the New Haven Symphony Orches-
tra.

Spivak's family had chartered
out a medical career for him, how-
ever, one of the country’s out-
standing bandleaders offered him
a job, he signed up and remained
with the outfit for five years.

He next joined the Benny Pol-
lock Band, another number one
outfit, and his next step was the
Dorsey Brothers Orchestra, where
he played alongside such musicians
as Glenn Miller, Skeets Herfut and
Bob Crosby. When Ray Noble came
to America, he asked Glenn to help
him organize a band, and the first
musician to be signed was Spivak.

When Spivak left to try his
musical wings on his own, he be-
came the highest paid free lance
trumpeter in radio, playing on the
Ford Symphony Hour, Kate Smith
and Fred Allen broadcast. When
he felt ready to organize his own
band, a lot of encouragement came
from Glenn Miller who told him
he had all the ingredients neces-
