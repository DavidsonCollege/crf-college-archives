orchestra ‘will furnish the music for Spring Frolics on April 27

and 28.

Thornhill! played for Mid-Winter
dances three years ago and proved
to be a popular song stylist witli
the students and dates.

Thornhill has a set up that in-
cludes five reeds, six brass and four
rhythm, paced by the leader’s elo-
quent piano. Most unusual of all

is the fact that in the six brass,
theré is a French horn. The horn,
which is usually identified with
symphonic orchestras, is being used
to blend with the colorfully -har-
monious arrangements of the lead-

Thornhill plays the piano with
casual ease, ‘his fingers gliding over
the ivories with an effortless grace

arrangements. His piano is heard
to telling effect in the beautiful
theme of the Thornhill band,
“Snowfall,” which he composed
and on virtyally all of the distinc-
tive Claude Thornhill arrangements
that have made this band so out-
standing,

Commie Speaker/Brown Chosen

Spurs Invite
To Discussion

The Comnuunists in North Caro-
lina were interested in our forunt
on Communism last weekend! The
chairman of the Communist [arty
in North Carolina, Junius Scales,
wrote three letters, one to Jack
Hunter, one to Pete Kalogridis,
and one to Randy Taylor, -:ffering
his services as a speaker. Part of
his letter appears below.

“However, as far as 1 can dee
termine, there is no one scheduled on
your program who can speak with
the slightest atithority on the his-
tory, ideology or program of the
Communist Party. ln fact, 1 would
venture a guess that if any one of
the ‘honorable gentlemen _ partici:
pating were not anti-Communist,
he would lose his job in view of
the anti-red hysteria currently pre-
vailing. In other words, they
have a stake in showing Conmiun-
ism and Communists in an unfavor-
able and one-sided light.”

“If you students have anything
to say about your. program and
if you are objectively seeking the
truth and want both sides of the
question, let me sugges: that thy
participation as Chairman of che
Communist Party in this state could
prevent this from becoming simply
a war-mongering jam session by
people who profit from the misrep-
resentation of Communism.”

OPS Economist

Dr. C. K. Brown, dean of the
faculty here at Davidson Col-
tege and one of the South's
leading economists, has accept-
ed appointment as the chief

Charlotte office announced Dr.
Brown's appointment on March
31.

Dr. Brown has scheduled
time in order that he may
continue full time work at Da
vidson and still lend a const-
derable amount of time and
cuergy to the Crarlotte OPS
office. His position ix one of
the top assignments on the
Mecklenburg staft. Jn the near
future Dr, Brown will have
assistants to aid in the gath-
ering and comparing of facts
relaied to the economic mat-
ters. of concern to the Char-
lotte office. This information
will be used not only, by the
local authorities but also by
the regional and national OPS
economists,
