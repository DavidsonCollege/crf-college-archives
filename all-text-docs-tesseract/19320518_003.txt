" THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 18, 1932

‘ “DOC” MATHIS

WINS VARSITY
BATTING CROWN

Although Coach Laird’s Wildcat baseball
representatives did not enjoy a very suc-
cessful season, they did bring their season
to a happy close by defeating the Demon
Deacons by a 1-0 score. Little Charlie Pearce
pitched one of the greatest games of his
brifliant athletic career, when he allowed the
Wake Forest sluggers only two singles and
no runs to win Davidson's only Big. Five
victory and hand the Deacons their lone
defeat by a Big Five rival.

Bruce Peabody and Earl Bradsher came
in for their share of honor when they dou-
bled in succession to give Davidson her one
run in the ninth inning. Barnes, of the
losers, had held the ’Cats to one single up
to that period, but the strain was too great
and the two doubles he permitted in the
ninth spelled his defeat.

Coach “Doc” Unger’s Freshman baseball
team scored three impressive victories dur-
ing the week in downing Belmont Abbey
twice and in plastering a one-sided defeat
onto the yearling team from Wake Forest.
We had the fortune (or probably misfor-
tune) of helping umpire one of the ‘Kittens’
games and must say that there are pros-
pects for a great varsity team next year.

Bumgardner, second baseman for the
yearling team, furnished the thrill of the
Belmont Abbey game played here last
Wednesday, when he hit a homer with three
men on bases. The diminutive has a bat-
ting average of only .203, but in gathering
that average he has hit five home runs, one
triple, and six singles.

“Doc” Mathis brought his brilliant col-
legiate athletic career to a close last. Thure-
day when the Wildcats played the Deacons.
Mathis has been a familiar figure on Wildcat
teams for the past three years, starring in

football, basketball and baseball. During his’
three years of varsity eligibility, Mathis has.

earned no less than eight varsity D’s. In
addition, he served ae alternate captain of
football and captain of basketball during the
past season. As a final accomplishment,

Mathis won the Wildcat batting crown by!

leading the varsity in batting averages and
scores, and tieing for stolen bases.

Since the varsity and freshman athletic
program has closed, inter-fraternity baseball,

To Win Batting Honors’

“Doc” Mathis, outfielder, won the batting
lead for the 1932 season when he hit safel
three times in seven trips to the plate in the
Wildcats’ two games during the week. Mathis

ble in seven trips, and Buck Mills, who failed
to hit safely in a tike number of times, Mathis

Wake Forest Freshmen

Downed by Wildkittens

The Davidson College Freshman nine com-
pletely turned the tables on the Baby Deacons
of Wake Forest, when Charlie Harris hurled
the 'Kittens to a smashing“10 to 1 victory on
Richardson Field last Friday. “Harris, a right-

thander, was in fine shape and turned the Little

Baptists back with four scattered hits.

The batting onslaught of the ‘Kittens shelled
two Wake Forest pitchers from the mound, and
sent quite a barrage of hits into the third one.

Hurler Harris contributed, to his cause with a]

double and a triple, thereby moving up to third
place in the batting average list. Morris, David-
son first sacker, had a perfect day at bat with
a single, two doubles, and a triple out of four
trips to the platter. Mackorell and Bumgarner
had four base blows to their credit.

on Richardson Field. The faculty-senior
game will not be played until after the close
of the semester, but in preparation for the
affair the faculty has scheduled a game with
the Sigma Phi Epsilon team to be played
this afternoon on the freshman field.

Ninety-eight Men Try
For Sigma Delta Psi

For the past two weeks competition for mem-
bership in Sigma Delta Psi, athletic fraternity,
and: for the athlictic trophy, has been progress-
ing rapidly. Already ninety-eight men, of which
fifty-five. are Freshmen, have reported to Coach
‘Whittle and have passed off one or more
events either on the track or tn the gym.

Competitors have had chances to try all events
except the hundred-yard swim, which is usually
run off in the pool in Mooresville and which
will be done some time in the near future. There
are at present ten men who have passed all but
the swim and it is expected that these will
pass that event when the time comes and be
taken into the- fraternity. Coach Whittle stated
that he expected that in all there would be about

offerings of the chunky little southpaw. Junie
Barnes, holding the Davidson sluggers in check
until the final canto, pitched a beautiful hall
game, allowing but three bingles. Two of these
were cnough to beat him, as Peabody doubled,
and Bradsher followed with another to score
the former with. the winning run.

Bunting and Hicks got the Dekes’ only two
hits, and Morrison, Peabody and Bradsher made
safetics for the ‘Cats. It was undoubtedly a
pitchers’ duel throughout, with Pearce spiking
the hig guns that had played sugh a large part

in Wake Forest's five previous ywictories over
Big Five teams.
In a previous meeting of the tw) teams the

Deacons trimmed the Wildcats 4 to 1, when a
third-inning bunting spree gave them a three-
run lead. Wake Forest is still leading the race
with six games won and one lost, and a win
over Duke will virtually assure them of the
state championship, but an underdog team from
Davidson College ruined a perfect séason for
them, by taking them into camp 1 te 0.
