Scriptures Differ
With Barth, Brunner

The distinction between the
Scriptures and the “Word of God”
and the experience of the Divine
human encounter, ideas made fa-
mous by Kar! Barth and his some.
times diciple Emite Brunner, were
subjects of discussion at the second
‘YMCA after-vespers discussion
group last Sunday night. The dis-
cussion was led by Dr. L. B.
Schenck and was held in his home.

The group shared in a measure
the great ey perinece o1 Dr. Schenck
whe studied under Barth this past
summer at the University of Base!
in Switzerland and who has brought
back a genuine enthusiasm in the
challenging position of the re.
nowned theologian.

Dr. Schenck answered a question
barrage after he had presented the
distinguishing tenets of Barth and
his variance with Brunner. A ;

eral discussion followed which con-
tmued in increasirg controversy
along the return paths to the dormi-
tories.

When Lake Wiley, below the
present golf course, washed away
in 1897, the Davidson College ma-
gazine reported that we now had
“a broken dam by a lake site but
no lake by a dam site.” (Quoted in
Miss Cornelia Shaw’s History of
Davidson College, P. 226. Censor

please note.)

The duties of the Davidson fa.
culty in the 1840’s were listed as:
“To give faithful instruction.”

“To watch over morals.”

“To maintain wholesome govern.
ment and discipline.”

“To assign rooms.”

“To frequently visit rooms and
observe their condition. . .at any
time of day or night.”

General Kane, a shrewd man of

the political viewpoint of a good
army officer. To him his job is
more important than winning the
war. He acts as the appeaser be.

he attempts to keep an even keel

COLLEGE MAN

(From Wofford College)

Our versatile, humor-loving Dean
Norton has done it again. Wednes-
day morning he presented to the
student body a reading which he
“just scratched off before chapel.”

Following is his definition:

What is a college man? He is a
man who lives in a beautiful park,
surrounded by trees, shrubbery,
birds, squirrels and college profes.
sors—in lovely surroundings. he is
tempted to be a time-wasting loaf-
er but, instead, he goes to the li-
brary and reads thousands of pa.
ges from books which make him
the companion of the great minds
of all ages.

What is a college man? He is a
man who can go past a television
set going full blast in the lobby
of Greene Hall—he can pass it by
knowing that it has four hours of
programs in the offering—and he
can go to his room and study for
four hours.

What is a college man? He is a
man tempted to spend three hours
with one of the most vivacious lit.

Degrade Students

State, College, Pa. (IP)—The
Pennsylvania State College recently
directed the removal of bars from
fraternity houses and other student
quarters and expressly forbid the
possession or use of alcoholic bev-

sweeping regulation announced by
the administraticn.

In a letter addressed to “all stu-
dent organizations,” the college
said that cules have been openly
disregarded. “Actually.” the letter

Noting that teen-agers were re-

ganizations for their active support
in cooperative measures designed to
“assist in the development of en-

The College,said the new order
was prompted in vart by “proof
