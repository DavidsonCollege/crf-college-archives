Reaction To War Sweeps
Over Campuses Of Nation

By The Associated Collegiate Press

Few campuses in the nation have been able to
shut themselves off from the dialogue over the war in
Vietnam. ;

An issue of such immediacy has not hit the campus
in years. And the campus is reacting with a fervor.

While the dissenters are still relatively few, they
seem to have given a war-and-peace orientation to the
entire campus.

The forms of dissent are as diverse as the cam-
puses themselves:

Near the University of North Carolina’s Chapel
Hill campus, students are exposed every Wednesday
to a long line of silent protestors. Among them one
day last month was an 84-year-old retired Episcopal
priest, who had been part of the vigil nearly every
week since January because, he told a “Daily Tar
Heel” reperter, “I want peace for my children.”

At the University of Minnesota, student war dis-
senters gained control of the Democratic-Farmer Labor
Club in Minneapolis’ Sixth Ward by being elected to
the top three posts, The Ward includes the University’s
West Bank campus.

The new chairman, Vance Opperman, a 24-year-
old law student, announced plans to introduce a resolu-
tion at the club’s November meeting calling for an
unconditional end to the war.

At Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., members
of the Students for a Democratic Society planned to
spark the University’s Founder’s Day ceremonies by
picketing one of the men scheduled to receive an hon-
orary degree—Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.

At the University of Nebraska, the student sen-
ate’s Ad Hoc Committee on Vietnam announced plans
for a. series of seminars on the war, followed by an
all-eampus referendum before Thanksgiving, ac-
cording to the “Daily Nebraskan.”

The Stop the Draft Committee at the University
of California at Berkeley, planned a week-long demon-
stration to halt operations at the Oakland Induction
Center. About 116 demonstrators, including folk singer
Joan Baez, were arrested on the first day of demonstra-
ting.

6 Several students and one professor at Utah State
University carried a peace torch. from the campus in
Logan to Salt Lake City as part of a 3,000-mile mara-
thon from San Francisco to Washington, D. C.

Marathon originator Richard Elmore flew from
Japan to San Francisco with live coals from the Hiro-
shima Monument to light. the torch, made partially of
fragments from U.S. bombs used in Vietnam, the
“Student Life” said.

Much of the protest is an outgrowth of Vietnam
Summer, a nation-wide program, according to the
“Student Life,” to “organize all opposition to the war
in Vietnam into a constituency that can exert pres-

sure to end the war.”

It works to “provide educational material on the
war itself, to encourage inclusion of the subject in class-
room studies, to provide information on the draft and
alternatives to the draft, and to conduct referenda in
selected communities across the country.”

Based on the precedent of the Mississippi Freedom
Summer of 1964, it “attracted over 26,000 volunteers
and over $200,000 in contributions at last count this
past summer,” the newspaper reported. Many volun-
teers returned to their campuses to spark local anti-
war action.

While the anti-war movement is becoming more
organized to make the intensity and strength of anti-
war sentiment known at the national level, the real
dilemma concerning the war remains a personal one—
because for the young American male, attitudes on the
war must inevitably be translated into a decision on
the draft—whether or not to accept a 2S deferment,
whether to go if called.

Oct. 16 brought the decisions of dozens of young
men across the country into the open when they turned
in their draft cards and pledged “total non-cooperation
with the Selective Service System.”

Before that, at a Lutheran Labor Day Conference
on War and Peace, 28 young Lutherans, among them
graduate students, signed a ‘We Won't Go” statement,
the Valparaiso University “Torch” reports. The state-
ment declared that “under no circumstances’ would
they fight in Vietnam nor participate in the military
“so long as the present war continues.”

The 2S deferment, held by most college males,
continues to be the target of campus liberals, who de
nounce the Selective Service System for giving the
college student precedence over the poor, the non-
white, the ungifted for whem college is an impossibili-
ty.

Spearheading the attack is the National Student
Association, which last summer pointed to the in-
equities of the system and called for the establish.
ment of a volunteer national army. NSA later called
for reforms of the current system, including the
elimination of universities’ participation in the Selec-
tive Service process. The Congress declared 2S de-
ferments “to be undemocratic and in effect, biased
towards higher socio-economic levels.”

While opposition to the draft seems to be on the
increase, it’s still a fact that most students, even
though they’re not fond of the idea, would serve if
called. The draft resisters hope to change all that.

And even though they may succeed in putting
questions in many minds, there’ll always be a few who
remain undaunted—like a Kansas student who daily

goes through the paces of a grueling physical fitness.

His reason: He wants to be prepared if called to
go to war.

Use Of Flag And Bias Fans Flames
Of Criticism Against War Series

By BOB REID
Managing Editor

Objections to the use
of an American flag in a
display case and the ap-
parent bias in the pro-.
gram format have arous- a
ed criticism of the “Why
War?" series.

Several people recoiled at
what they considered an im-. };
proper use of an American
flag. as it was draped in the
corner of the Why War? dis-
play in the College Union.

" Still others believed the ,

program did not present both a

sides of the question, and -

the subject.

“That committee couldn't
have been more stacked,”
said senlor Joe Beard, ‘‘if it
had been Jayne Mansfield
and Marliyn Monroe. Those
ladies are dead now, and |
believe the committee should
fotlow suit.’”’

“The display puts the flag
in such a light that it is de-
graded in my _ estimation,”
said senior Ron Dougherty.
“I look upon the flag as an
extension of the United

States. The flag never loses
its identity.”

Beard agreed that he

Union president and chair-
man of the “Why War?" se-

the flag.

“I don't think B. A. ever
thought of degrading the flag
and country.” Beard said,
“but that’s the problem—he

One student muttered in
disgust: ‘‘they ought to take
the flag and lynch him (Ai-
ken) with it.”

Aiken, who is also a con-
_ scientious objector, said the
display was a work of art
and not an attempt to de.
grade the flag. But Beard
disagreed: ‘‘It’s not a piece
of art: it's a piece of propa-
ganda.”

ken “in rather strong lan-
guage" that he would forci-

bly remove the flag unless the.

display were changed. But,
Dougherty said. Aiken told
him if the flag were removed
he would charge the remov-
er with thievery and turn
him over to the Honor Court.
Dougherty then gave up
plans for any demonstration
against the display or the
program.

Some faculty and students

also felt the program format
was not presented in the
manner it had been adver-
tised. They said they believ-
ed the program would pre-
sent both sides of the issue
of war as an instrument of
national policy. However,
many felt the planning com-
mittee had scheduled a pro-
gram which presented only
the case for pacifism.

“It seems to me that al

said, Father Minh was sched-

announced.

Of Bias In ‘Why War?’

maintain that the series is
biased by pointing out that
an effort was made to secure
pro-war speakers for the pro
gram.

It was their inabflity to
participate in the program.
rather than prejudice on the
part of the planning commit
tee, that determined the pres
ent program. he said.

When asked if he didn't feel
that the Union was above
bias he answered. ‘It’s not
and neither is anybody else.”

He pointed out that mili.
tury recruiters are brought to
Davidson under the sponsor
ship of the Union. and that
any group wishing to organ.
ize a pro war program, was
free to do so.

Aiken said that the war in
Vietnam had not been plan
ned as the specific topic, but
he realized that the subject
of America’s present involve
ment in Southeast Asia would
inevitably arise.

The program was organiz.
ed, rather, to treat the prob.
tems of war in’ general. For
instance. ‘The Magician"
treats war allegorically, ‘‘The
War Game" deals with ther-
mo-nuclear warfare. and eco
nomics Professor Ernest Pat-
terson will speak on the eco-
nomics of war.

theme of the program was
chosen because of a fortunate
occurrence, Aiken said.

the Union.

The presentation of Dr.
Hans Morgenthau's Reynolds
Lecture and the showing by
the YMCA of “The War
Game’’ within a few days of
each other. plus an express-
ed interest on the part of the
Union and the student gov-
ernment to sponsor a_ pro-
gram dealing with war and
peace led to the planning of
the two-week’ series.

Aiken said that his great-
that even more dialogue
would result from this pro
gram than from a program
involving the invited hawks;
adding that he was pleased
by criticism of the program
for it indicated student inter-

est.

Aiken expressed the belief
est fear was not from hawks
or doves, but rather from the
closed-minded.

When pressed as to wheth-
er he would prefer a closed
minded pacifist to a closed-
minded miltarist, he replied
that he doubted there were
very many closed minded
pacifists: “‘When you enter-
tain minority ideas you pret-
ty well have to be open-
minded.”

The ‘‘Why War?” program
also includes a speech on
chemical warfare by David-
son Political Science Profes-
sor John Fuller, an address
by Dean Philip Secor of Muh-
lenburg College on political
implications of war and a
talk by Dr. Ernest Patterson
on the economic implications
of war.

ROTC Department Refuses
Participation In War Week

Members of the David-
son College Reserve Of-
ficers Training Corps
cadre were invited to par
ticipate in the “Why
War?” programs, but, ac-
cording. to an officer in
the department, they “of
ficially declined the invi-

tation.”
The member of the depart-

ment said Army officers at
Davidson have ‘generally
not participated in any such
programs because of the
compromising position into
which one may be forced as
a member of the United
States Armed Forces.”

He called the Army “an
executor of national policy
and not a debating society.”

CO Spouts. Pacifist

By BILL SEIGLER
Associate Editor

The essence of pacifism

is ‘an objection to war-
fare and violence of all
kind.” according to con-
scientious objector David
Maynard.
In a speech here Tuesday.
Maynard, a former Harvard
student who has been a CO
since he was 14 years old.
said the pacifist believes war
“breeds more antagonism
and hatred than it elimi-
nates.””

Maynard, whose appear-
ance was sponsored by the
“Why War?” committee, said
pacifists base their bellefs on
religious committments and a
vespec? for human life.

“No one has the right to
take a life.” he said.

After showing a film on the
alternatives to military serv-
ice, Maynard led a discus-
sion on the draft status of
conscientious objectors and
the philosophy of pacifism.

He explained there are two
classifications of conscienti-
ous objectors. In the first
classification, 1.A-0, a man
could qualify for non-combat-
ant service in the armed
forces. Under the 1-0 classifi-
cation, a conscientious objec-
tor would be allowed to sub-
stitute two years of civilian
service in branches such as
the Peace Corps for service
in the military.

In discussing the shitoso-

phy of pacifism, Maynard
said pacifists are ‘against
participation in wars of any
form. The CO is not trying to
avoid any duties to the coun-
try, but he feels participation
in killing is not a true serv-
ice to your country.”

“Phere is a difference,” he
added. ‘between being non-
violent and doing nothing and
non-violent and actively re-
sisting.“

Maynard said he was pleas-
ed to see the growth of con-
scientious objection on cam-
Puses around the country. “I
am heartened to see the in-

creasing number of young.

men who are considering the
moral implications of the

He said he was not opposed
to the idea of Davidson con-
ducting such a forum, but
that “it would simply be
awkward for us to partici-
pate in it.”’

Davidson cadre are middle-
rank (captain and above)

Maynard said he left Har-

ed “dissatisfaction.” He tater
