does not worry
Admissions

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

Davidson’s unlucky slide
down 13 places in U.S. News and
World Report did not cause Dean
of Admissions Nancy J. Cable to
presuppose a decline in the num-
ber of prospective students or ap-
plicants.

Contrary to some beliefs,
Davidson’s steady increase of ap-
plicants in recent years was not
soley a result of the school’s top
positioning in the report.

Cable points out that this in-
crease began three years ago, two
years before Davidson was de-
clared the eighth best college in the
nation.

Cable, though stating that she

is “not in a position to say what
effect the report will have,” be-
lieves that the Office of Admission
can still expect to receive as many
or more applications.

“We are in the wonderful po-
sition that ‘just describing
Davidson’s strength is important,”
Cable says.

grass grow too high to mow, so
that he had to use a weed-whacker
instead.

Despite not living up to his
responsibilities as a landlord, resi-
dents claim that he still placed ex-
treme expectations on tenants.

Tenants had to sign leases that
banned kegs from the houses, re-
quired them to register every party
with Case, and subjected residents
to a one dollar fine for every beer
can found on their lawn.

On the other hand, some resi-
dents had few complaints, and said
that though Case detailed unfair
requirements in their leases, “he

Hillary Rodham Clinton speaking at the NGO Foru

would never [enforce] them.”

In fact, some former tenants
held little against Case, describing
him as “an all right guy” who often
came to their parties just to social-
ize.

Other students describe Case
as amicable only when they were
prospective tenants but hard to deal
with when they became residents.

Some claim that though he is a
“good businessman,” he was often
negligent toward his responsibili-
ties as a landlord.

One past tenant said of his
experience with Case, that ‘‘over-
all, it-was- OK butit wasn’t-the
most convenient‘of situations.”

Marshall Case was unavail-
able for comment.

call 911, police officers will be
forced to inform in writing the
students’ landlord on the day after
the party.

Reporting to the landords was
suggested a few years ago by a
group of landlords who wished to
know of student residents’ activi-
ties including any violations of the
law. :

i Some students like Jenn Wil-
liams, who has lived off campus

for several years, feel that students
should be responsible enough to

live in the community without the
harping of community members
who stereotype off-campus stu-
dents as being irresponsible and
disruptive.

“If you are a student and the
police must come to your house to
tell you to quiet down the noise,
then your landlord hears about it
the next day. Whereas the police
don’t report anything to the land-
lords of non-student renters. Isn’t
that kind of discriminating and goes
to show that this town must think
that college students are synony-
mous with loud noise and party-

ing?” said Williams.
McKiernan added that it would

not hurt for students to get to know
their neighbors and even tell them

of the world, we have a responsi-
bility to think globally.

Because we are more educated
than most people will ever be, we
have to work with people who do

‘not have a voice in international

relations.
Dealing with women’s concerns
more locally, could you explain
the purpose of the Women’s Issues
Committee here at Davidson?
The Women’s Issues Com-
mittee is one of the committees on
the Union Board, and it’s the job of
the Women’s Issues Committee to
do programming on issues that
women face at Davidson as well as
national women’s issues.

same way.
My favorite machine was the
shirt presser. Ever wonder how
your shirts get those little rectan-
gular marks in the front? Those are
the marks of this machine, holding
the shirt in place. It holds itin place
on a device roughly shaped like a
torso. They push the button, and
the “torso” moves into a box where
it is pressed, with lots of steam and
hissing. The “torso” then pops back
_ out, looking like a million bucks in

its freshly pressed shirt. As this is
a vague description, I refer those
interested to the scene in The Em-
pire Strikes Back where Han Solo
is frozen in the carbonite pit by
Darth Vader. The parallel is strik-
ing.

The last device of note is an-
other dry cleaning device, affec-
tionately named “Suzie.” “Suzie”
is a device roughly shaped like a
female, used to get the wrinkles
out of dresses. “Suzie” actually
wears the dresses, allowing some-
one to work on them while they are
roughly in the shape of the wearer.
“Suzie” also gets used when

wrinkles need to be removed from
sport jackets. Go to the desk and
demand to see her. The staff will
gladly indulge you.

I hope that you have gained
some insight into the realm of
Davidson laundry. The staff asked
me specifically to make this point,
so if you’ve learned nothing else,
keep this in mind. The staff there
works hard to make sure that ev-
erything you send gets back to you
in the best shape possible. So the
next time you squint for your num-
ber, whip out that pen and write
those digits, because, people, no
one needs to go blind over laundry.

It encourages discussion and
promotes good relationships be-
tween women faculty and students.

This fall we’ re doing two book
discussions on Naomi Wolf’s sec-
ond book, Fight Fire with Fire, an
eating disorders awareness week,
aglobal women’s awareness week,
and a speaker in October to talk
about homosexuality in the church.

If people want to be involved
in women’s issues and how what
we do at Davidson fits in with the
rest of the world, I encourage
people to get involved in the
Women’s Issues Committee.

when a big party is planned. “This
way neighbors can simply come
over and say the party is too loud or
whatever before they end up call-
ing us,” he said.

Although many students were
apprehensive about the meeting,
their reactions were mainly posi-
tive; feelings toward the towns-
people of Davidson were both co-
operative and understanding.

“T really think this meeting
was a great idea because it let ev-
eryone know who the police are,
that they are here to help and gov-

ern. They are not here to break up
the laws and know that we must —
enforce them,” said senior Jonathan
Pieslak.
