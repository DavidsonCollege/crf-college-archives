‘Week of Prayer

for

Christian Unity

During the eight days from Friday, January 18 to Friday, January 25, Christians
all over the world will be praying for peace and unity. On the Davidson campus, we will
join with them, as various groups come together to sponsor a variety of programs, op-
portunities to learn about the Church beyond our community, and worship activities.
Suggested meditations for the week will be available in the Union, Chambers Lobby, the
Library, and the Commons. Following is a schedule of events open to all.
