The Wright Stuff

Photographer of legend talks ebout exhibit aie euperiaice

By AsHER Woop
Guest Writer

On January 30 at Davidson’s
Visual Arts Center, Pedro E.
Guerrero delivered a lecture about
Frank Lloyd Wright, his former em-
ployer and subject of his photo-
graphs now on display in the VAC.
He took a modest approach-to one
of the top architects of this century:
“Don’t expect me to say anything
profound about him ... our conver-
sations were never very profound.”
He discussed many of his own per-
sonal experiences and recollections
as Wright’s photographer.

Early inthe lecture, he informed
us that he would be talking. and
showing slides primarily about the
person of Wright, rather than about
his architecture. Frank Lloyd
Wright, considered the country’s
greatest architect, is well known for
the innovative architecture pro-
duced in his seventy year career,
but most people know very little
about him as a person. Guerrero
gave us, both with his photographs
and lecture, a humble view of a
legend, resulting in our apprecia-
tion of the subject of the photos and
the photographer himself.

After time spent studying pho-
tography in college, Guerrero fol-
lowed the advice of his father and
went to work in Arizona as a pho-
tographer for Frank Lloyd Wright.
“Tf [had known whata great man he

s ... [probably wouldn’t have fit
in and wouldn’} have gone.”

Luckily, he went, and his show
at the Museum of Modern Art en-
sued in 1940. In his 20 years of
service as photographer, he photo-
graphed 27 of Wright’s architec-

tural projects, as well as many sub-
jects in his travels with Wright’s
entourage, including shots of trav-
elling, architecture, model-making,
the surrounding landscape, people
working, picnics, and even some
pictures of Wright. These personal
shots include scenes of Wright play-
ing the piano, carving a pencil, ina
car, on a horse, at his desk, with his
wife at a Halloween party, and many
others.

The exhibition at the Visual
Art Center’s Edward M. Smith Gal-
lery, Frank Lloyd Wright: a per-
sonal view, features twenty-five
black and white images of Wright
taken by Guerrero. Guerrero’s book,
Picturing Wright, an Album from
Frank Lloyd Wright’s Photogra-
pher, is available for purchase at the

Gallery. It is important to see
Guerrero’s work in order to fully
see Frank Lloyd Wright; as he ex-
plained, “you can look up his archi-
tecture in the library,” but people
are rarely able to see who he really
was.

Also on exhibit at the William
H. Van Every Jr. Gallery in the
VAC until February 27 is Robert
Colescott’s Works on Paper. The
first African-American ever to be
selected to represent the U.S. at the
Venice Biennale single-artist exhi-
bition this summer, Colescott’s ca-

reer will be.surveyed by Christo--

pher Wyrick (Davidson, ‘95) on
Feb. 10 at 4:30 p.m. in the VAC
auditorium with a reception follow-
ing in the atrium.

Palatable Pleasures

Put the sauce back in your life

By JEFFERY CROMARTIE
Chef-in-Residence

For some of us, our lives at
Davidson are beginning to wrap up,
and it is time to add the finishing
touches which turn a simple yet
hardy meal into an extravagant work
of art. The entree is steaming; the
side dishes are simmering, and the
cheese has melted on the soup. All
that remains is one final specialty
which will make your meal distinc-
tive and memorable. In the culi-
nary realm, I speak of glazes and
sauces. Beyond the kitchen, I speak
of much more.

Many of my Davidson friends
look back on their college trials and
hardships with a certain level of
bitterness. The job market is as
fierce as ever, and many of us ques-
tion the practicality of a Davidson
education. Our friends at other
school have the same job opportu-
nity and more competitive grades.
They have the same entrees and
sides dishes, yet the sweltering
plague of grade inflation has shel-
tered them from the self-imposed
rigors we as Davidson'students have
shared. Self-imposed?  —

They are far too busy forcing each
other to jump through bureaucratic
and political hoops to have any
power over us. They very much
love us, and they will go to great
lengths to serve us, but they have no
real basis of power. Can they make
a second semester senior really
work? Nobody can. Our teachers
should be loved for their efforts, but
only a fool would fear them. How-

extreme caution. Be very nice to

these people or your apartment could .

flood with sewage, and any record
of your existence at Davidson could
mysteriously disappear. Don’teven
try to tell me they haven’t thought
about it.
So, we are back to questioning
our self-imposed rigor. Why did
we do this to ourselves? Are we
stupid? Well, not all of the time.
Then why? Because everybody else
was working hard. Peer Pressure?
Maybe in high school, but free think-
ing college students are less prone.
Perhaps parental pressure. Come

Our minds and souls require much
more.

Weare here struggling away at
Davidson because plain grilled
chicken, baked potatoes, and peas
are not satisfying. They are filling,
but we yearn for more. Are we
spoiled? Intellectually, yes. Many
of us can never return to our naive
beginnings, where we could have
settled for less. We have tasted the
fruit, and we are paying a very seri-
ous price. The spice has saturated
our blood, and we are very much
addicted. The metaphor you choose
matters little, but the glaze you cre-
ate will be with you forever.

In our years dwelling in the
garden of Davidson, we have by our
own diligence gathered the re-
sources necessary for our own sauce.
Each will be unique in flavor and
zest. It is time to create from which
we have gathered. As gleaming
twilight descends, it is time to feast
with friends and be merry.
Enough dogma, let’s cook:
