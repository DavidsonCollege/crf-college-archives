Miller Reveals Past Life:

SEARCH FOR GOD

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

He had been an egoist and a coward since he
was four years old. Although he had been relativel
successful in love, .in athletics, in business, he still
had an empty feeling. He continually asked himself,
“Why me?”

To illustrate the enigma of the question, “Why
me?,” Keith Miller, Monday’s chapel speaker, de-
scribed an incident on a subway commuter train in
New York. For several minutes, he had been watch-
ing a man down the ai:.e become sicker and sicker
looking.

Finally, as the train made a stop, the man got
up, trying to hold back the inevitable, and staggered
to the door. Outside stood an impeccably dressed
executive. Just as the door opened, “the boy just
barfed all over that man’s blue suit.” As the train
moved on, Miller could make out the words of the
man as he stood there dripping, “Why me?”

DIFFERENT FACES
“That is the exact question.” he said. “that has
been bothering me for years. I have just been wear-
ing faces since I started to college. I've got a church
face, a lockerroom face. and even a face for my

‘parents’ friends.”

He began to wonder.why-he didn’t know “why.”
Two incidents which occurred while he was in col-
lege. Miller continued, changed his understanding
of life.

" “One was the ‘death of his older brother in a
plane crash during World War IL. “I worshipped my
brother.” he added. “and his ‘death nearly broke my
heart.” The tragedy also tore apart the lives of his
parents, who had appeared so stable to him.

His father suffered a heart attack and his mother
a nervous breakdown soon after the accident. “I

southern Texas, “I found none of that security stuff
in the executive level, only ulcers and worries.”
SEMINARY

After a few years of daily routine, Miller decid-
ed to enter theological school, to find his mission in
life. “My wife,” he said, “thought I was crazy, but
said that she would go. too.” They obtained scholar-
ships and away they went to divinity school.

“It wasn’t,” he remembered, “any different from
the world. Everybody was trying to claw his way to
the top.” He did not find God, so he left after four
terms.

The Millers returned to Texas, where he re-
tained his old job. He was not happy, however, be-
cause “everybody looked at me like I was either
queer or not intellectual, just because I left school.”

LONE EXPERIENCE

One day, he just took off to the woods country
where he could be alone. He stopped his car by the
side of the road and began to cry. “Finally.” he con-
tinued. “I said to God, ‘If there is anything in this
stinking soul you want, take it.’ “Immediately,” he
said, “I felt like a burden had been lifted from me.”

This was 10 years ago. Said Miller, ‘I’m still an
egoist and a coward, but, God gives me some days
when I can, live free from. worry.”

He added that God doesn’t want your time, but
your will. “If you’re runnin’ scared, like I was, try
it.”

The first Annual Spring
Convention of the North

| College Council was pro-

nounced a qualified success

factor in the Young Republican

{in every aspect except age.

The convention was also simi-
: lar to those held at regular state
and national party conventions,
{ featuring the traditional mix-
ture of serious politicing and
| equally serious partying:

Friday evening final plans
were made in the conservative
camp, headed by representatives
from U.N.C., State, Duke, and
Davidson, for their actions at
the next day's general business
meeting—the focal point of the
convention.

Coalitions were formed and re-
established on both sides and in-
telligence reports were brought
up and pondered again and again

until early Saturday morning, as

‘poth the rising sun and the dele-

gates gol higher and higher.

NIXON ADDRESSES

Richard M. Nixon addressed
the assembled‘ delegates noon
Saturday at a dinner in his hon-
or g.ven for the benefit of the
party. All agreed as to its suc-
céss In every way. except, per:
haps. for the notable absence of
the flag to which Nixon attempt-
ed to pledge allegiance. The
flag was later found in a room
of. the Davidson delegation.

The business meeting Satur-
day afternoon was marked by
the dominance of the conserva-
tive element of the College Coun-

cil in the adoption of a strong *

conservative platform and the
motion by the Davidson delega-
tion chairman. John Futch, to
