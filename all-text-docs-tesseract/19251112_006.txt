Several plays

| On the night of Tuesday, October 2oth,
| . . .
/the members of the Dramatic Club their

| first meeting ofthe year. The mecting
[was a social gathering at which the reg-

}ular members and all those interested in |

lits activities were present. A number
| of the young ladies and matrons of the

|town, who took part in the plays last |

year, were also in attendance. Fred
|Smith made the first talk of the evening
|asking the co-operation of the members.
Professor Erwin then made a short talk
outlining the plans for the year. He al-
'so announced that a one-act play would
be given on stunt night. The presenta-
tion will be a mystery play, the cast in-
{eluding L. L. Deck, Wood Brown and
| Bud Guthery. The play was rehearsed

| before the club and given its hearty ap- -

|plause. The active members then with-
ldrew to consider the new constitution,
which had been drawn up, and accepted
it in full. At the close of the meeting
sandwiches and punch were served and a
social hour was enjoyed by all those pres-
ent.

The club, under the direction of Pro-
fessor, Erwin, plans to give two presen-
tations during the year. The first of
these will be given on Thanksgiving night
after the Duke game. Three one-act
plays written by Fred Smith, Wood
Brown, and Professor Erwin will be pre-
}sented, It has beenthe policy of the
club during past years to give plays writ-
ten by the students themselves in order
that any latent talent along this line,
which a student may have, may be de-
veloped. Since these plays have been

}exceedingly popular the same policy will

be carried out during the present year.
Under the leadership of Fred Smith, as
president, and Wood Brown, vice-
president, the year will certainly be a
successful one. Any member of the stu-
dent body, who shows talent along this
line. will be given a chance to take part

men and a number of matmen have been
working out optionally. Official practice
however will start next Monday, the 16th,
according to an announcement by Cap-
tain Weems who will again coach the
wrestling team.

A splendid schedule has been arranged
for the matmen by J. C. Frierson, man-
ager of the team, including besides
matches with other colleges in the state, ,
outside matches the biggest of which is
one with the Naval Academy about the
first of March.

The first match will probably be in the
middle of January, giving the candidates
something over two months in which to
train. November 16th will be earliest
| date which a Davidson team has |
started practice and this carly start is
expected to do a great deal in putting
the team in tip-top shape by January.

Four letter men are back from last
year’s squad around which Captain
Weems expects to build his team, al-

though he says the places are open to}
the best man, regardless of whether he |
is a varsity man or not. The men return-
ing who won their “D" last year in
wrestling are Captain W. D. Cox, J. C.
| Frierson, manager, Barrington and Harry

Vance.

Freshmen are cligible for places on the
| varsity team and to represent the school |
in any meets. Captain Weems is espe- |
cially anxious for all freshmen as well.as
other students who are interested in the |
sport to turn out for the team. The
coach says he would like to see several
places on the varsity team filled by the
yearlings as it would help the team for
four years to come. To stimulate Fresh-
man interest in the sport, Captain Weems |
is offering a beautiful and appropriate |
medal to the best wrestler in the fresh- |
man class. To win this he does not nec-
essarily have to be on the varsity team. |
The winner will be picked by the wrest-
ling coach, captain and manager.

Since wrestling is recognized as a bene- |
ficial development of football men, is is
expected that a number of football play- |
ers will come out for wrestling at the
conclusion of the football season.

The boxing class which is being coach-
ed by Captain Elkins is expected to be of
much help to the wrestling candidates as
they will afford cach other mutual work-
outs. If the proper number of candi-
dates turn out and the team is given the
right kind of support, a successful mat
season may well be prophesied for the

Wildeats.

Beauty of Campus

During the past summer many improve-
ments were made on the campus that are
worthy of notice, and at the present time the
campus and the two literary society halls are
undérgoing some important improvements.

On Concord street a stone wall has been

not only greatly improves its appearance but
also prevents it from washing. The woods
behind Chambers have also, been cleaned up
and thinned out. On the front of the cam-
pus, top soil has been put on the strip next
to the strect, and it has been fertilized and

| seeded, and in a short time it should be in}

much better condition. The ground in front
of Chambers is being prepared for seeding,
and it will be done as soon as the weather
permits.

In front of West and Georgia the brick
wall has been extended, and now runs along
part of the road in front of the athletic field.

There is a great deal of slope to thé ground
between Georgia and West and the ground
has been washing badly, but two cement re-|
taining walls have been built there to stop
the washing of the soil. A chain fence has
also been put along the side of the roads on
the campus to keep automobiles off the
grass. |

The improvements on the two literary so-
ciety halls will be the installation of a com-
plete heating plant for each one. These
plants will be large enough to heat not only
the two society halls on the upper floors, but

also the two halls to be built on the lower |

floors which will be occupied by the Pandenic
and Metrophilian Literary Societies. These
improvements will contribute a great deal to
the comfort of the members and are expect-
ed to increase the membership and the at-
tendance at the meetings.

COLLEGE JOURNALISTS

(Continued from page 1)
These meetings are thought by all to be
very helpful and effective. Here the prob-
lems of the journalists are taken up and
freely:discussed. Among these are means of
financing, matters of policy and other kindred
subjects.

Publications Borad, has arranged an attrac- |
tive array of social festivities for the occa-’

The Wildcats are always good for a
comeback. Take 1920 for instance, Geor-
git Tech won 66-0, and the next week

scattered Wake Forest for a
27-7 victory. Take 1917: V. P. I., State,
Georgia Tech, and Navy had won and
the Wildcats pulled an iron-man stunt of
six straight victories over Virginia Mili-

was appointed chairman of the commit-

the class.

At a class meetng last week the report
of the committee was heard, and three

presented for the consideration of the
class, these garments being shown by
students who are campus agents for
clothing concerns. After a discussion by
the class, none of the articles presented
were selected.

Speir and his committee are at work,
getting in contact with clothing con-

future meeting.

While the popular sentiment in the
class seems to be in favor of having
blazers, the class has reached no decision
