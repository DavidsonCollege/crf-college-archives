Heartbreaker

Grid Cats suffer
disapointment in homecoming
game after encouraging win
over Methodist

By Robert Lloyd-Still

On a beautiful day for homecoming with
2,500 fans in attendance, Randolph-Macon
upended Davidson in a nerve wrecker. The
Cats led the entire game until Yellow Jackets
quarterback Andrew Bush and receiver David
Hughes connected on a 21-yard catch. That
completion gave Randolph-Macon a 21-16
victory.

Davidson appeared to have this game
wrapped up with a 16-7 lead and only 3:49 left
to play. The Cats were unable to stop Hughes
and the Randolph-Macon passing game de-
feated Davidson in the end. Special teamsalso
hurt the Cats in this game. After halftime, the
Cats allowed a 98-yard kickoffreturn to Dexter
Hurt.

When the game appeared over with thirty
seconds to play, Quarterback Richard Howell
provided the Cats with a glimmer of hope.

He hooked up with Ike Bailey on a 42-
yard fly pattern. Howell then ran the ball eight
yards to the Yellow Jackets 33. With seven-
teen seconds to try and score a touchdown,
Howell through the ball up to Kelly Shirley in
the endzone.

The pass was close but Randolph-Macon
defensive back Dwayne Elmore intercepted
to end the game.

Howell played another strong game in his
illustrious careef at Davidson. He completed
13 passes out of 24 attempts for 216 yards and

one touchdown. On the ground Howell scam-
pered fora 38 yard touchdown that appeared to
put the Cats up for good.

Davidson really wanted this game espe-
cially for Head Coach Landis who played his
collegiate football at Randolph-Macon.

“The kids played hard and deserved bet-
ter, but that’s not the way it worked out,”
Landis commented. “We had respect for the
passing game, but they did a great job of
making the play when they hadtoso maybe the
law of averages caught up with us.”

The week before this devastating loss,

Davidson handed Methodist a 34-7 beating. The
game was over fall break with few students in
attendance, but the Cats played for pride. The
Cats’ record now stands at 4-3 and they really
want to finish above five hundred this season.
Davidson students are not the only ones who
have recognized a dramatic improvement in the
football team this season. Ron Green of the Char-
lotte Observer wrote two weeks ago that noted the

imprc ‘ovement.

The Cats hope to rebound this coming week

when they face Hamden-Sydney at 1:30 at Rich- °

Women's soccer draws even after weekend of hard Play _

The women’s soccer team
evened its record to 8-8-1 with
losses to the University of Dayton
and Campbell University and an
overtime win over the University
of Louisville.

The Wildcats spent fall break
on the road, first traveling to Day-
ton.

Field conditions were terrible
after asteady rain that continued to
fall throughout most of the game.
The strong Dayton squad, who re-
cently tied powerhouse University
of Virginia, handed Davidson a 4-
2 loss.

The team then traveled to the
University of Louisville. Down 2-
Oatthe half, the Wildcats came out
aggressive in the second and sent
the game to overtime at 3-3. Sopho-
more Claudia Lombard, who had
scored all three of Davidson’s goals
in regulation, also put in the game-
winner during overtime.

“The game against Louisville
was exciting because it was the
only time we’ve come back to win
this season,” said freshman Lucia
Plosser.

The Wildcats then faced
Campbell here at Davidson last
Saturday. Davidson had more shots
on goal than Campbell but couldn’t
put the ball in. Campbell took the
contest 3-1.

“We haven’t won the games
we needed to, like the Campbell
game, to get ranked in the region.
We have the talent, we just haven’t
executed,” said senior Jenny
Satterfield.

' The team will finish up its

season this weekend with a: game
against Virginia Tech, who beat
the Wildcats earlier in the season
2-1.

“They weren’t as skilled as
we were. We weren’tplaying smart
in ourlast game with them, though.
We missed some opportunities in
the last game, and if we play well
we should win this time. It would
be a great way to end the season,”
said Satterfield.

Adding to her comments was
sophomore Katie Schwab. "The
team has really worked hard this
year; we've given all we have. To
finish with a winning season
wouldn't be what we'd hope for
earlier, but it also wouldn't be a
huge disappointment.

Field Hockey ends week with a 1-1 tie

By Nancy Hilles

The field hockey team had a
busy Homecoming Weekend as
they played both Wake Forest and
Radford University.

On Saturday, the Wildcats
traveled to Winston-Salem for their
last game on turf this season.
Davidson played one of the best
turf games they have played all
year, but the Demon Deacons out-
scored the Wildcats winning the
game 3-2.

Sunday afternoon Davidson

‘ faced Radford, one of the team’s

biggest rivals. Once again, the
Wildcats played strongly, but they
could not come up with the win.
The two teams battled through
regulation time plus two overtime

periods, with the final score end-

ing up ina 1-1 tie.

The Wildcat’s loss to Wake
Forest was an especially disap-
pointing one ‘because the team
dominated the first halfof the game.
Davidson was playing extremely
offensively, taking numerous shots
and pouncing on the Wake goalie.
With about ten-minutes left in the
first half, sophomore Holly Kledis
scored with a hard shot on goal.
With this lead, the Wildcats gained
confidence and ended the half with
momentum and enthusiasm.

However, in the second half
Wake caught some of that energy
and scored fairly early. Davidson
Started playing defensively and
with more caution and the Dea-
cons scored two more goals (one
avs | the result of an unfortunate

oversight made by the referee).
The Wildcats did not give up
however, and they turned on the
offensive pressure once again.
With about five minutes left in the
game, Erin Lang scored one of her
picture-perfect penalty strokes,
hitting the upper right-hand corner
of the goal-cage. Davidson con-
tinued to push up offensively, but
they could not get the ball in the
cage, giving Wake a 3-2 victory.
After this loss, Davidson was
more determined than ever to oblit-
erate Radford, a team they have
never beaten. Back on their home
field, the Wildcats played with in-
tensity and aggression, and despite
Radford’s dirty tactics, the Cats

Complaining
& whining
about sports

Imust confess to feeling some-
what bummed, and certainly not
very sportsmanlike, The Davidson
football team just left its heart on
the field versus Randolph-Macon,
only to watch the Yellow Jackets
win on a last-minute touchdown
pass. Rats. Watching Davidson
lose, combined with the fact that
I’m sitting in front of a computer
screen during homecoming week-
end, has left me, well, bitter.

So, while we’re on the subject
of bitterness, its time to talk about
everything that I don’t like about
sports nowadays. When you see
me this week, stop me and let me
know whether you agreed with me
or not, at least that’ Il let me know
whether you read the ole’ “Cat
Nips” section. Here goes:

The NCAA is just doing a
poor job in its governance of col-
lege basketball. Before this season
the NCAA decided to delay the
beginning of the hoops season by
two weeks, so that practice begins
on November 1 instead of October
15. They also voted to cut the num-
ber of basketball scholarships a
school could award from 15 to 13,
and to limit the number of assistant
coaches a program may hire.

Now, granted I don’t know
the whole reasoning behind the
adjustments, but I reckon they’re
trying to pare down the ever-grow-
ing stature of the game, to help
keep college basketball programs
from becoming semi-pro organi-
zations rather than humble partici-
pants in intercollegiate athletics.
The real result is that fewer high
school basketball stars are gonna
able toplay college basketball with-
out the scholarship help, and that
fewer young coaches are gonna be
able to find coaching positions.

Now, if those things don’t
seem like a big deal, consider the
view of many black college
coaches, that fewer A frican-Ameri-
cankids will be able to gotoa good
college at all, due to the cut in
scholarships. Is college basketball
somehow now better because two
fewer kids per school will get a
free education out of basketball? Is
the game better because. fewer
young coaches will get the chance
of a job at the college level?

College basketball is going to
continue to grow, certainly nation-
ally and maybe even internation-
ally. Cutting the allowance of fund-
ing or practice days will accom-
plish nothing, and the NCAA ei-
ther needs to reevaluate its options
or else explain something to me.

Now, onto complaint number
two. Why the heck is Major League
Baseball doing this whole realign-
ment thing? Since my dad was a
kid there have been four divisions,
and the best team from each after
162 games gets to go to the play-
offs. So even though the San Fran-
cisco Giants won the second most
games in baseball this year, they
