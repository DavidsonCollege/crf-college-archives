Davidson Male Chorus to enchant Eastern States.

General Practice

By MIRE T ANNER
Managing Editor

In the past weeks. the college
intirmary has become a place
of fellowship twice daily as
students gather for relief from a
wide variety of flu symptoms
The question though, and one
that many ask themselves as
they dray toward the building.
is who exactly is going to be
there.

College Physician William
Davis is no longer with us and
his absence now is common
knowledge, but what about the

man who has assumed _ his
duties as college physician?
Charles Marshall M.D.. a

Davidson graduate, class of ‘65,
has returned for a brief ex-
perience in general practice
before continuing his
specialization. Marshall, who is
a graduate of the Medical
University of South Carolina,
described his reasons for taking
his present position as a desire
to see the life and work of a
general practicioner more so
than a willingness to become

Chorus Makes Spring Circuit

under the direction of Donald B.
Plott. will head northward for a
six-day tour during spring
break.

The thirty-six members of the
chorus will tour six cities in six
days: Richmond, Washington.
Wilmington. New York.
Philadelphia and Culpepper.
Va.

‘We try to vary the menu and

originally composed for male
chorus, though some tran-
scribed works meant for mixed
groups are also used."

The composers whose works
are emphasized by the chorus
are representative of the diver-
sity of the program. Selections
from Schubert and Brahms, a
Renaissance group, and folk-
oriented pieces are the main-
stay of the bill.

The appearances of the
chorus are arranged in various
ways. Some are by invitation.

some are tied in with alumni
meetings, according to Plott.

The Davidson Male Chorus
has been very successful
through the vears. Plott con-
tinued. because of the
availability of talented students
who are interested in carrying
on the tradition.

The group right now is con-
posed mostly of younger stu-
dents. with few seniors, the
future is bright. he said.

“Freshman classes are im-
portant.” noted Plott. “They
have been fruitful. As long as
this continues, the chorus will
remain laudable.”

says of the music to be per-
formed in the concerts. ‘‘The
music is_ basically work

Others come from personal
contacts by members of the

ticular cities involved, while

trustees and the president three years ago is given a chance to

We need to face the fact that you don't implement coeducation
simply by clearing two floors of Little Dormitory, cleaning up the
bathrooms, and putting 50 women there. For Davidson to become a
truly coeducational institution, more change than that is
necessary.

We need a new Union almost as much as we need a new dor-
mitory.

We need some honest talk about academic standards at David-
son. | am uneasy over the frequency with which blame for the
alleged decline of these standards is placed on students’ shoulders.
After all, other people set admissions policy. devise the
curriculum, determine the educational policy, and improvise the
college budget. Perhaps that is how it should be (1 am certainly not
arguing for student supervision of any of those areas) — but then,
let the blame fall on those with the power to rectify the situation.

We need an evaluation of the premedical program. My hand
trembles as I write these blasphemous words, but I suspect that
Davidson is turning out aspiring doctors who have succeeded in
avoiding a liberal arts education in their four vears at Davidson. It
is hardly a phenomenon confined to the Martin and Dana
Buildings—but nowhere else are some courses more scrupulously
avoided, and other courses more fervently sought, than by our
premeds, caught in the med school grade-point trap.

Those are enough headaches for one year. Who will take the
initiative in responding to those problems? I am not sure. Of one
thing, however, I am quite sure, and that is that things aren‘t going
to get a whole lot better for students around here until we start lear-
ning to care about something more than getting into Bowman Grey
Medical School or Chapel Hill Law School.

Until we as students stop looking at Davidson primarily as a
means—as a prep school, of sorts.—to the time honored end of
graduate school admission, things aren't going to change vers
much. We just won't have the time.

[don't want to end on such a sour note. [have had the privilege of
working with many fine men and women in the faculty, ad-

ministration and student bods this past vear. On the whole, | have

been impressed with what Uhave seen of Davidson in the past vear.

IT have many people to thank, and a lot of fences to mend. That
should keep me occupied until June.

Dramatic Two-Hour Reading

By VAL VAN HORN
Asst. Features Editor

He stands in the center of the
enclosed room, people scattered
in chairs and clustered at his
feet. There is no quiet, lyrical
introduction to the black poet
and playwright) from Los
Angeles, all is:still.

Then suddenly he cries that
he is the devil. The poet con-
tinues haranguing the spec-
tators about his identity and
multi--identities. growing loud-
er and more certaim with his
claims until one finds himself
wondering if it really is Satan.

Sensing this, the convincing,
mocking flow stops. The man
informs his people that they
have just heard the prologue of
“Tambourines to Glory" by
Langston Hughes.

He is indeed Tommy Scott
Young, who appeared at Lingle
Manor on February 6.

Young presented a two-hour
poetry reading on love, drugs,
reflections of mankind, politics
aid sound. His presentation
was dramatic, centered on
bombastic vocal and histrionic
talent softened with song, chan-
ting and quiet lyrics.

All the work was original,
with the exception of ‘‘Tam-
bourines to Glory"’, two poems
by K. Curtis Lyle, one poem by
Luther Keys and a scene from
Ossie Davis’ ‘*Purlie Vic-
torious.”’

Young's love poetry was
mostly soft grass-root, with a
minimum of theatrics. Perhaps
the most poignant was ‘Black
Day’, written about a girl he
worked with in Los Angeles.

His drug poems started with
“Lonely World.” which was a
combination song-chant. His

voice sounded as a primitive
choirboy's, lifting in its plain-
tive mourning.

Three of his six drug poems
were powerfully done, with
Young bombarding his listeners
with shells of cries. ricochet-
ting from the walls and ceiling
to the eardrums.

The rest of his poems were a
mixture of truths, defiance,
cries to his brothers to unite and
an occasional rough beauty.

Marshall. who after his
residency at the Medical
College of Virginia, spent: the
year of 1971 as an Army surgeon
in Vietnam, emphasized the im-
portance of the role of the
family doctor in an age of in-
creased = specialization — in
medical education and prac-
tice. “Before moving into Bill
Davis’ office, I had no idea that
the GP faces the problems that
he does, in terms of both
facilities and the number of
patients that he sees,”’ he said.

According to Marshall, the
family doctor practices what
could best be described as ‘Old
style medicine’, the care of a
physician for his patients and
interest in them, often without
the aid of much of what modern
medical technology has to offer.
“Usually, simply becuase of the
location or because of limited
time, the GP has at his disposal
his head, his hands and his in-
sight and that’s it,’ he pointed
out.

‘Tl think the controversy
going on now in medical schools
over general medical education
as opposed to the extremely
specialized one is significant:
the type of men who will
become doctors in the future.
the variety of their abilities and
number of capacities in which
they will be able to serve will
depend very much on the out-
come of this question,” Mar-
shall said.

‘Too few men these days know
what the career of the small
town doctor is like and too few
are thus able to respect them
for the sacrifices that they
make and which I am now
coming to realize,” he con-
tinued.

‘That's why I'm here. I think
that anyone who now is vaguely
considering medicine should
examine this angle of the
profession if he wants to see it
for what it truly is.”

Marshall will remain until
July of 1974 when he will return
to the Medical College of
Virginia for specialization in
ophthalmology.
