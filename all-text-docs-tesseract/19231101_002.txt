State’s second game this year,

SENIORS DEFEAT SOPHS

In a slow but interesting game last Tues-
day the Seniors defeated the Sophmores in
the first inter-class basketball contest to the
tune of 33 to 19, The game progressed rath-
er languidly, the Seniors getting the jump on
the Sophs right at the start without much ef-
fort. Boushee and Elkins rolled up a large
score before the Sophs could get started,
The only fast part of the game owas in the
last few minutes of play when the ‘Sophs
started a drive too late to get any where but
kept the game from being a runaway.

and shooting far surpassed that of the Sophs
and if the game had been faster on the
whole they would have thrilled the specta-
tors, The Sophs could not seem to pene-
trate the guards of the Seniors but when they
did the ball usually went through the basket,

Sophomores had little team work for some
reason and everyone seemed to be playing
for himself. They made but very few fouls,
however, and played as hard as the warm
night would permit.

The first half the Seniors looked as if
they were going to have a walk away. Bou-
shee, MeByrde and Elkins were all over the
floor all the time, it seemed, and could shoot
as often as they tried. The guarding of Cur-
rie and Ed Brown kept the Soph from get-
ting under the basket, while their forwards
rang ‘em in at the, other goal. There wasn't
very much team work during this period, but
somchow the Seniors were always where the
ball happened to he whether they threw it or
not.

The second half saw the Seniors second
team in action but when the other side start-
ed to some real basketball the first team
came back and for the last of the half both
teams played like houses afire. The Sophs
got some good started and with
“Kelly” Moore blocking the Seniors passing
the other members of the team started
shooting. Most of the Seniors goals were
made from longshots, Paul Story getting
three in about five minutes right in succes-
sion.

For the Seniors Boushee with his eleven
points was high scorer. For the Sophmores,

“The Midget Marvel of Southern Foot-

Black for three years. Though small of sta-

those years in which some of the best gumes
ever played by Davidson teams took place.
Spratt came here from Citadel with a rep-
utation as long as a doctor's bill, and soon
proved himself one of the best backfield men
ever to wear the Red and Black. Rumor
had it that football marvel had come to
Davidson and was then on the sidelines to
