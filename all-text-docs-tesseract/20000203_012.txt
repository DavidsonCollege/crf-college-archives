onds: as it tried to pull off a comeback over
conference leader Appalachian State.

Unfortunately, the Wildcats’ heroics fell
short as the Mountaineers were able to match
Davidson almost shot-for-shot in the closing
seconds and managed to pull out a 77-72 win
Monday night at Belk Arena.

Stephen Marshall led the way for the
Wildcats in the first half, recording 17 points
and nine boards. He finished the night with
his fourth career double-double—24 points
and 11 rebounds.

But his lean second-half performance
reflected the Wildcats’ inability to get the
ball inside, which cost the Wildcats dearly.

“When the guy who scores 17 in the first
half doesn’t touch the ball in the first four
minutes of the second half, something is
wrong,” head coach Bob McKillop said.

By the end of that four-minute stretch,
App State had outscored Davidson 2-11 and
the Mountaineers kept piling wood on the
fire.

“The game was decided in the first four
minutes of the second half,” said an agitated
McKillop.

Mountaineer coach Buzz Patterson, who
notched his first win at Davidson since join-
ing the program in 1994, echoed similar sen-
timents. “At halftime, we emphasized that

period, the deficit
had grown to thir-

when the Wildcat

the net with a 3-

to within 10, 50-60.

Wildcats’ only successful three-point attempts
of the half.

Jeff Bergmann was 0-for-5 on the night
until he landed two threes in the last 20
seconds of the contest, the second of which
pushed the Wildcats to within 4 points of the
Mountaineers. But that was as close as the

The Mountaineers were too quick and
too poised in their transition game to let this
one slip away, even in that last minute when
Davidson refused to let the flame die. With
almost every successful rallying basket by
the Wildcats, the Mountaineers scored one of
their own with tremendous efficiency.

“Our ability to defend the perimeter was
outstanding,” McKillop commented. “Most
of their threes came in transitions.”

An important element of those success-
ful transitions was App State’s Tyson
Patterson, who finished the night with 18
points and five assists.

“Tyson Patterson is the guy who makes
that machine hum,” said McKillop . “He has
great abilities and we gave him some open
looks that he was able to take advantage of
because of his talents.”

The Mountaineer coach returned the com-
pliment. “Landry is one ofthe best rebounders
in college basketball,” Patterson said. “He
just has a knack, and we were really worry
about him getting up there and cleaning the
glass.”

Kosmalksi, who averaged eight rebounds
per game going into Monday night’s contest,
recorded only seven against the Mountain-
eers before fouling out late in clsoing sec-
onds.

The Wildcat Roar was out in full
force at Monday night’s game
against the Mountaineers. The
Roar, usually heckling visitors
from behind the south goal,
doned the body paint and
sported “WILDCATS” from V.I.P.
courtside seats.
