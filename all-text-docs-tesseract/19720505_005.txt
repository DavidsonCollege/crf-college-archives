LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

MaeCormac Ex

To the Editor:

As past president of the
Davidson College chapter of the
AAUP, I feel compelled to re-
ply to the article on the tenure
system by Bill Giduz and Phi!
Bishop, beoause of the number
of inaccuracies found therein
and the misinformation that
the article presents about the
nature of tenure.

In the second paragraph of
your article you state that.
“. . . most institutions acceded
to those guidelines years ago
with no trouble arising watil 10-
cently.” One of the reasons that
the AAUP was founded in 1915
was to protect professors from
administrations ‘and Boards of
Trustees who were firing them
‘because of their beliefs.

A ghance at “The Develop-
ment of Academic Freedom in
the United States” by Hofstadter
and Metzger or at “Academic
Freedom and Tenure” edited by
Louis Joughin or a review of the
“Bulletins of the AAUP” select-
ed on a ten-year basis would re-
veal that during the period
1915-1972, professors have peen
fired because of their beliefs
and the AAUP has bcen waging
a defense of academic freedom-
all during that period.

The article states that “ ‘ade-
quate cause’ means only that

cause cannot be academic in —

nature.” The 1940 Statement of
Principles on Academic Free-
dom and Tenure which is the
basic statement on academic
freedom accepted by most edu-
cational and professional as-
soclations and many colleges
and universities provides that
faculty may be fired for in-
competence. Surely this is an
academic matter. The 1940
Statement reads, “In the hear-
ing of charges for incompetence,
the testimony should include
that of teachers and other
scholars, either from his own o%

from other institutions.”

The article states that ‘‘dur-
ing taeir probationary period,
professors are evaluated ac-
cording to fhe AAUP standards
of research, teaching, and uni-
versity serviee.” The standards
of evaiuation used by various
institutions of higher learning
are their own and not those of
the AAUP. At Davidson, there
is nO eapbe statement on the
precise method of how faculty
are to be evaluated for tenure,
for salary inerease. or for pro-
motion.

The article states ‘‘as a warn-
ing and hint to young profes-
sors, the guidelines assert that
the juvior faculty member must
take special care not to intro-
duce into his teaching contro-
versial matter which has no
felation ‘to his subject.” This
Statement is ineorrect in that
the admonition of the AAUP
Statement on Terure does not
refer specifieaily to junior fa-
ecully but to ati faculty. The
Statement. reads in its entirety,
* Fhe (cachor is entitled to free-
dora in the classroom in dis-
cussinn hi subject but he
Slicuid oe curctul not to intro-
duee into his teachi-g contro-
vers.al matter which has no re-
lation to his subject.”

There is no question. that
tenure has been abused both by
faculty and by administrations.
Junior faculty who have not
had tenure have been coerced
and the AAUP is presently re-
commending a change in Hts
policy foward non-tenured fa-
cuiiy fo protect their academic
freedom more than is now donc.

Administrations that have not
taken fenure seriously have al-
lowed men to go teyond tke
seven-year period and only then
have worried about compet-
ence. Careful and fair evalua-
tion of a faculty member’s

plains A

teaching contribution, his schol-
arship, his competence, and his
general contribution to student
fife through guidance and coun-
seling all should be evaluated
when making a decision as to
whether to retain this man on
@ permanent basis. tf in the
fulure, he becomes irresponsi-
ble and unwilling to keep up in
his field he should be warned
of this, and if he does not re-
spond to the warning he should
be charged with incompetence,
a charge which faculty should
be willing to sustain if proven.

The argument that a man
should not be retained because
he does not get along well with
his colleagues is irrelevant to
the evaluation of his perform-
ance as a teacher and a scho-
lar, Undoubtedly, there will oc-
cur conflicts among men who
are pursuing the truth, as there
is no one truth but a variety of
ways of apprehending ideas,
systems, and principles that
men call ‘'truth.”

When the article suggests that
tenure promotes incompetence,
it should also consider the al-
ternative of a system without
icnure where men could be dis-
missed on the mere whim of a
department chairman, or a
dean, or a vice president, or a
president, who happens not to
like the man or believes that
the man voted the wrong way
in a recent electicn, or espoused
principles that are unpopular in
this particular state. There are
many who, if it were not for
tenure, would have been dis-
mi:sed long ago because of
political, religious amd social
beliefs.

A professor has two primary
purposes, the pursuit of truth
and the education of youth, and
ja carrying out these tasks he
must be free to express his in-
tclectual views wherever they

lead him. This does not give
him license to speak on topics
on which he is not competent
outside his area of specialty
(except as an ordinary citizen
with opinions and attitudes).

1 welcome a series of articles
on tenure but | deplore those
that are factually inaccurate in
their representation of the
views of the AAUP. The docu-
ments are available for all to
see and a. responsible discus-
sion of tenure should take place
on the basis of these facts and
not on misinformation. Tenure
“should be evaluated both in

terms of its strengths and its

weaknesses.” And if the alter-

native of a system without

tenure is worse than a system ©
with tenure, then we should all

work to improve the present

system that we now have which

includes tenure such that in-

competence and stagnation are

not protected and rewarded.

I write this letter as an in-
dividual and make no pretense
of speaking either for the local
chapter of the AAUP or the
national organization.

Attacks

Security System

To the Editor

Firstly, I’d like to protest
the inconsistent mannerisms of
Davidson’s ‘‘nonsecurity” police-
men. Recently I was parked in
the area just above the power
plant building and behind Duke
dorm. My back tires were over
those ridiculously patterned
yellow lines there and my car
was very much abreast of a
sign which reads STUDENT
PARKING. My car was there
for approximately twelve hours
off and on one day.

The next day, Officer Linker
returned with his red hot ticket
book and socked it to the ol
green Vega. I was hacked. I
sought out the old guy and
presented him with my case
(see above). He then presented
me with his case and refused
to eradicate the ticket from his
“‘records.”

He said that my story was a
‘‘gross misrepresentation” of
the situation and that if he had
not been right he would not

Bowles Backed [n Saturday Primary;
Rabil Supports Honor Code, Not Apathy

To The Editor:

The following article appear-
ed in The Daily Tar Heel’s
April 11 issue. It outlines the
position Skipper Bowles has tak-
en in recent years.

If you will be voting in the
May 6 Democratic primary in
North Carolina, you owe it to
yourself to read this statement.

Bo Phillips ‘74
Davidson College

Though it may cost him votes
in the May primary, Bowles has
voted for liberalized abortion
and against capital punishment.
Right now in the legislature, he
is the principal sponsor of the
strong Environmental Bill of
Rights, an amendment to the
state constitution which will fi-
nally provide a constitutional
mandate for restrictions pre-
venting industry from polluting
this state.

Bowles’ primary goal as gov-
ernor of North Carolina will be
to increase the per capita in-
come of all of its people, es-
pecially through expanded voca-
tional education.

Bowles is certain that there
needs to be a drastic oyerhaul

in our insurance laws, He is
proposing a limited no-fault in-
surance plan which will rclieve
the over-crowded court dockets.
He also advoeates revising the
insurance laws which now per-
mit massive discrimination
against both the very young and
the elderly. Bowles fecls it is
wrong for the under-25-year old
male with a peifect driving rec-
ord to be charged a higher rate
than his 35-vear-old neighbor
who has been twice convicted of
drunken driving, simply because
of age.

Another way in which Bowles
has stood up for young people
is his active promotion of the
18-year old vote. In addition, he
fought hard in the General As-
sembly to get the privilege of
absentee ballots for the pri-
mary election on May 6.

Remember his. stances on
abortion, the environment, occu-
pational and vocational educa-
tion, and lowering the voting
age, when you vote in the May
6 primary: with your help, he
can be one of the most effective
governors this state has ever
had.

To the Editor:
This letter is directed to the

high status one achieves at”

Davidson by being apathetic,
and the consequences of this
upon the Honor Code. When I
speak of apathy, do not think
I'm speaking of apathy in an
absolute way. I am speaking of
apathy in a very particular
way apathy towards -the
common interests and well be-
ing of the entire college com-
munity. ,

This area of common com-
munity interest is not like an
athletic team, campus orgamni-
zation, or fraternity / eating
club. It has no special exe-
cutive committee or spokesman
to act as a watchdog for it. The
manner in which we fulfill our
obligations to this area of com-
mon interest determines David-
son’s reputation, liveableness,
and academic life.

The Honor Code is an inher-
ent part of this area of common
community interest. Every stu-
dent at Davidson should have
a deep concern for the Honor
‘Code, because it is up to every
student to make“it work. Break-

down of the Code in any area
could place the entire Code in
jeopardy.

One area in particular in
which the Code is not working
is the library. Everyday, people
remove (steal) books (refer-
ence books, govt. documents,
etc.) from it with little concern
that this is an Honor Code vio-
lation. If the Code is not obser-
ved in matiers as serious as
this, then what is going to pre-
vent the breakdown of the Code
in other areas? The only answer
is a renewal of student aware-
hess and concern for the Code.

This is exactly what £m call-
ing for. Unless we experience
this renewal of concern for this
particular area of commor com-
munity interest, then all ihe
future holds in store for us is
the eventual breakdown. and loss
of the entire Honor Code. Un-
less we as students meet these
and other obligations, we have
no right to complain when
things begin falling apart, and
we will have no one to blame
but ourselves.

have written the ticket. His ex-
planation of the previous day’s
stay of the car was that it was
just overlooked.

And furthermore, when I said
I was going to take the matten
to the administration and asked
him who was in charge of such
matters he admitted that he
didn’t really know himself. I was
forced to laugh one time during
our conversation when he said
something to the effect of how
did I think he had been around
so many years if he didn’t
know when a car was or was
not illegally parked.

But let me get back to the
matter of my car being over-
looked for a day. OVERLOOK:
ED? Sure it was overlooked.
Just like dezens of robberies
have gone overlooked this year,
the most recent and _ serious
being the stealing of a full set
of tires from a student’s car
while it was parked below the
gym.

I for one have noticed no
crackdown by any phase of law
enforcement in this area. And
TI am quick to guess that the
policemen who work the night
shift here on campus do not
miss too many of their favorite
television programs nor do they
lose an enormous amount of
sleep. Something needs to be
done. End of protest number
one.

Protest number two is against
the college’s allocation of spend-
ing as it relates to the parking
problem on campus. Davidson,
although it is a small campus,
Should still have ample park-
ing space for students in the
immediate residence or acade-
mic area. The _ college, .of
course, will be spending a tre-
mendous amount of money on
a new library and hopefully a
new and better student union.
These things are practically
necessities. ,

But I think the college coula
perhaps take half of what it
is spending on landscaping and
planting trees and construct a
parking lot. Where? I would
have to say that the most logi-
cal and convenient place would
be in the area immediately
behind Richardson dorm. A
hundred to two hundred — car
parking lot would. easily fit
there, and it would help solve
the ever-increasing problem of
where to put all the cars.
