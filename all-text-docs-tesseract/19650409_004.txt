PHILOSOPHY OF SORTS...

“e FOOTBALLERS WORK OUT

4Spring Pratice Begins

By NEVILLE PATTERSON

When spring finally comes most peoole are ready to forget about fall and the y-
return of cold weather. Nevertheless, there are exceptions. Last Tuesday Homer |
Smith’s footballers began working out for the coming season.

members comes some sort of switch in philosophies,
ideas, and stands.

Never let it be said that the Sports Department
of the paper is out to buck hallowed tradition. So to
satisfy tradition mainly, and also anyone who could
be remotely interested, I have hastily thrown to-
gether a few of my random ideas on athletics and
formed some sort of something you might call
“Sports Philosophy”—or filler trash, depending on
your mood.

The different objects of athletics are known to
each of us. The emphasis on these objects is where
individual “philosophies” differ.

Sports build a competitive spirit that has advan-
tages far beyond a playing field.

Sports heighten a sense of fair play.

» Sports sharpen the mind and strengthen the
ody.

Sports are an outlet for pent-up energy. They
provide an eseape from pressures that tend to clut-
ter up the mind and cloud mental outlooks on life,
schools, books, etc., etc.

Sports give an unlimited field for fun. They pro.
vide hours of conversation, amusement, and relaxa-
tion for the individual.

Sports also have broader values than those for
the individual. Sports, especially at a place like Da-
vidson, have an important effect on “the Group.”

“The Group” becomes identified with their
school’s athletic teams. Through sports “the Group”
gains a feeling of unity, a spirit that can grow
stronger and deeper and give enthusiasm and pride
where apathy and -pseudo-sophistication once ruled.

A part of this group, I emphasize another side
of sports. Cold and heartless, ruthless and. realistic,
I emphasize—to the disgust of the ‘purist’’—win-
ning.

Now calm down if this upsets you. I don’t mean
that “how you play the game” isn’t important, on
the contrary. All the other benefits of athletics,
which are considered objects of sports—improve-
ment of mind. body. and spirit; relaxation; pleasure;
enjoyment; etc., etc—are important. and 1 don't
want to belittle them. The benefit they give the indi-
vidual undoubtedly outweighs the immediate value
of a victory. No one contests this.

With winning as the main object, the other ben-
efits of sports aren’t necessarily lost. In its right
perspective winning can increase the value of these
other things.

Sportsmanship, relaxation, competitive spirit,
physical strength. health, and all the other men-
tioned objects or benefits of sports should never be
forgotten. Winning must never be so much the ob-
ject that it replaces these things.

But there isn’t yet so much an emphasis on
winning around Davidson that the other sides of
athletics are in danger.

For the group especially and the individual to a
large degree winning is important.

I fee] like my stand isn’t really too controversial.
I don’t expect too much disagreement. Frankly, I
don't expect anybody to have read this far. If win-
ning isn’t the primary object of an athlete, he is
missing the point of keeping score.

POLICY, TOO...

As a postscript 1 might throw out a little state-
ment of Sports Editor policy I plan to follow.

I will give credit where it is due, without hesi-
tation or hedging.

] will compliment when 1 feel I am able to do
so without getting corny.

But I also expect I'll. criticize a little—construc-
tive criticism with a mind for improvement as well
as criticism of things that are wrong, but unchange-
able (e.g. the Southern Conference Tournament).

Hopefully wit, sarcasm, cynicism, satire, cold
facts. and reality will be my weapons .. . not a very
imposing arsenal.

DAVID FAGG PUTS BOYS THROUGH RACES
Part of Last Tuesday’s Drill

Spring football practice
brought gray winter spectres in-
to sharp focus for 53 varsity
players and five coaches. When,
on May 8, the last practice wil!
have been completed, head
coach Homer Smith should know
just where his Wildcats stand.

As any good coach, Smith is
cautious not to draw conclu-
sions from two days of spring
practice. However, he notes,
“The first couple of days were
very encouraging from a coach-
ing standpoint. We will be ready
to play well both offensively and
defensively. Of-course, itis yet
impossible to say bow well we
will do against other teams, but
we will play well.”

Tom Scott’s linkmen extended their season record to 7-3 during a “Good Deais”
sweep through Florida that included victories over Columbia, Patrick Air Base, Or-
lando AFB, and Jacksonville Naval Statioa, and a loss to Florida Southern.

After arriving in Lakeland they
practiced on the local course
through Monday, and on Tues-
day the team played in a 3-way
match with Florida Southern
and Columbia.

Their first and only defeat. of
the week came in the form of a
11-19 loss to Florida Southern.

Columbia bowed to the ‘Cats

The next day the team moved
to Cocoa Beach, where they took
Patrick Air Force Base 13-1.

In the next two days they
swung their way through Or-
lando Air Force Base 1644-132
and wound up their 4-1 week
with an easy 21%-8% victory

Marcon Explains Charge
Made In Winston Paper

By SAM BOYTE
Assistant Sports Editor

“] think this whole matter has been blown up too far. It should never have been

picked up by the AP or even put in the Winston paper for that matter. I’m sorry,

that is the way I feel.”

This ‘was the opinion of Da-
vidson’s Charlie Marcon about
the minor basketball scandal
that broke with an article in a
Winston Salem newspaper last
week.

Steve Clark, a recent David-
son graduate who is now a
sports writer for the Winston-
Salem Journal quoted Marcon to
the effect that conflict between
Fred Hetzel and Don Davidson
had prevented the Wildcats from
imoroving on their season mark.

MARCON
Feud or Not ?

Marcon does not believe that
any conflict between Hetzel and
Davidson was important enough

but

In a letter to the Winston.
Salem paper Marcon said that
he had spoken to Clark as a

tion.

The team had also planned. to
play in a tournament at Cap>
Coral. but scheduling difficu!-
ties prevented it.

Dr. Scott's reaction to the
team's performance was, ‘I
thought they all played real good
golf, extremely good consider-
ing that every match was play-
ed on a course that was new to
them. That’s always tough on
a team.”

The seven. members of the
team wound up their tour on
Saturday by playing on ‘‘one of
the nation's finest courses’’ at
Sea Island. Ga., and returned
Sunday. boasting a 7-3 overall
record,

On Monday the number-one

Smith revealed that he will
not cut the team; as indeed he
could fll afford to do. ‘‘We want
all the boys hitting, hustling.
and playing hard. Under the
present substitution rule, we will
be able to substitute every posi-
tion each time the ball changes
hands. If we have the depth, we
are going to platoon. I think
we'll have to.”

The Wildeats will run from
what Smith calls a ‘‘basic spread
right. or spread left.” This is
simply splitting one end wide
either to the right or left. There
will be variations. There is Ht«
tle chance, however, of trying
anything so romantic:as the in

ovation that Army used in

which Lou Carpenter refused to ©
join the Cadet huddle.

Coach Smith is no romantic. |

He is very much a realist. Yet
he can objectively say, ‘‘I see

no critical weaknesses in any
area of our squad. Some pretty
determined boys are trying out
in all positions. I'm pleased with
the way the boys are competing
for each position.”
