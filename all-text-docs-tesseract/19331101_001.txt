Phi Beta Kappa Issues |
Bids to Six Students

McGeachy, W. M. Thompson,
W. T. Thompson, Casali, Dill,
and Blair Honored

A. G. McGEACHY LEADS

W. M. Thompson and W. T.
Thompson Rank Second and
Third in Average

Six members of the Senior class have
been invited to become members ‘of
Phi Beta Kappa this fall semester, ac-
cording to an announcement made
public by Dr. P. H. Gwynn, secretary
of the Gamma Chapter of North Car-
olina, located here. A. G. McGeachy,
W. M. Thompson, W. T. Thompson,
Odi Casali, J. E. Dill, and J. T. Blair
are qualified for membership in this
honorary fraternity.

All of their grades averaged higher
than 94 per cent, two per cent higher
than the membership requirement of
92, McGeachy has the highest schol-
astic average among the group with
97.44. W. M. Thompson, with 97.18;
W. T. Thompson, 96.10; Dill, 94.54;
Casali, 94.48, and Blair, “4-40 completed
the list.

The qualifications of Phi Beta Kappa
are two-fold. First, the students must
have the three-year highest averages
in the Senior class; and second, they
must’ be of-good moral character.
These qualifications make the Phi
Beta Kappa the most respected and
sought-for of all honorary fraternities
inethe United States.

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and
largest of honorary Greek letter fra-
ternities in America. Founded at Wil-
liam and Mary College, Virginia, in
1776, it had soon established chapters
at Yale, Harvard, and Dartmouth dur-
ing the eighteenth century. Since then,
many chapters have been added until
now there are over 100 chapters in the
best institutions of the United State:
and Canada, and its enrollment has
grown to 60,000 members. It started
as a social fraternity and developed to
an honorary society as a reward for
excellence in scholarship. Its motto is
“Philosophy, the Guide of Life.”

A. G. McGeachy, of Fayetteville,
who has the highest average in the
Senior class, is also a member of the
Y. M. C. A. Cabinet and has been
active in many societies.

W. M. Thompson and W. T. Tombs
son, of Richmond, Va., are probably
the only twins Davidson has ever had
to make Phi Beta Kappa. Both ‘of
them have been exceedingly active in
most all of the school activities. W.
M. Thompson is president of the Y.
M. C. A., while W. T. Thompson is
the editor of the “Wildcat Handbook.”
They belong to several honorary fra-
ternities and are members of the Kap-
pa Sigma social fraternity.

J. E. Dill, of Buchanan, Va., is presi-
dent of Sigma Phi Sigma honorary

er, and Ben Wyche.

The meeting was opened wits a one-
act play, “Cupidon, Dentiste,” which
was presented by four of the newly-
initiated members, Coleman, Glass
Slaughter, and Wyche. After the com-
pletion of the play, the initiation cere-
mony was performed, and the pledges
were accepted into the chapter.

A series of French songs was ren-
dered by Dave.McLain and Frank
Tucker, followed by a reading in
French by Bob Coit. The entire club
then joined in a number of French
games.

After the singing of several chan-
sons, delicious refreshments were
served to the club, and shortly after-
wards the meeting was adjourned.

dents in his recovery.

Fine Showing of
Band is Praised

Many Complimentary Letters Re-
ceived by Professor Pfohl

The Davidson Band, judging by the
letters received by Prof. J. C. Pfohl,
20-year-old director of music here, has
earned a place of distinction by its per-
formance at football games.

An extract from a letter by Robert
Long, section chief for Phi Gamma
Delta social fraternity, reads- as fol-
lows: “I enjoyed the football game
(Davidson-Carolina) but the thing
which interested me most was the
great improvement the Davidson
Band.”

At the same game, Earl Slocum,
head of the University of North Caro-
lina Music Department, wanted to
know “where Davidson got such fine
concert material.”

Mrs. S. D. Jackson, head of Public
School Music at Johnson City, Tenn.,
inquired as to the “catchy little tune
played by the band and which I heard
whistled on the campus while there.”
Needless to say, it was the march
“Cheerio,” by Edmund Franko Gold-
man, the most widely known band di-
rector in the country today.

At a_ supervisors’ conference . at
Greensboro last week, Goldman ex-
pressed interest in the fact that his
marches were so popular on the Da-
vidson campus and promisedsto send
an autographed picture of his band.

“Lost Leaders and Happy Warriors”
was the subject of a lecture delivered
in the Chambers Auditorium last Fri-
day, October 27th, by Dr. Edward
Mims, head of the English Department
of Vanderbilt University. The reputa-
tion that Dr. Mims possesses as a bril-
lant attracted a large audi-
ence.

After being introduced by Dr. Cum-
ming, of the Davidson English Depart-
ment, Dr. Mims explained that the title
of his lecture was a combination of two
the former by Brown-
ing, the latter by Wordsworth, In
writing “Lost Leaders,” Browning had
Wordsworth in mind as a model.

Taking up the first poem in detail,
the speaker named different
types of people who might qualify as
Browning’s “ Lost
There is the young man who, having
great possibilities, dies early in life.
John Keats is an apt example. Then,
Lost Leader is used in the sense
of the man who possesses wealth, po-

fuses to make the effort. “A third Lost

Annual Fall Meeting to Begin
November 19th

The Y. M. C. A, has been very for-
tunate this year in securing, Dr. Ben-
jamin RK. Lacy for the fall services.
These services are an annual institu-

tion, and, since their inauguration a
number of years ago, have played an
important part in the student life on
the campus.

The Y. M. C. A. has always sought
to have one of the outstanding relig-
ious leaders in the South to conduct

these services, and this year it has se-

cured one of the outstanding men in’

the Southern Presbyterian Church.

Dr. Lacy is a graduate of“Davidson,
and, as president of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, is one of the most loyal sup-
porters or the college. In his under-
graduate days he was outstanding as
an athlete and a campus leader, play-
ing on the varsity football team, and
holding many student body offices. He
has been honored by the Omicron
Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa fra-
ternities.

Dr. Lacy, after graduation, won a
Rhodes Scholarship, and continued his
study at Oxford University, He was a
chaplain overseas in the World War,
and it is said that to this day anyone
who speaks against Dr. Lacy in the
presence of any enlisted men is invit-
ing trouble, so great is their love for
him,

For many years a pastor in Atlanta,
Ga., he is now president of Union
Theological Seminary in Richmond,
Va., and is molding the future leaders
of the Southern Presbyterian Church.

The services will be held this year
from November 19th through the 22nd.
There will be two exercises daily, be-
ginning with church on Sunday and
continuing through an evening service
Wednesday night. All students are
urged to set aside these dates so that
they will not miss a great religious

EXERCISES TUESDAY

Prof. Currie Explains History and
Purposes of Circle

Eight prominent members of the
Senior class were tapped for member-
ship into Omicron Delta Kappa, na-
tional leadership fraternity, through its
Delta Cirele in the annual fall Tap
Day exercises held during chapel pe-
riod yesterday morning in Chambers
Auditorium.

William M.

lanta, Ga.; Hugh

Jv, of Gastonia; W. Alexander Kirk-
land, of Durham; Andrew H. Manson,
Jr, of Jacksonville, Fla.; Edward L.
Powell, Mobile... Ala, and = W.
Taliaferro Thompson, Jr., of Richmond,
Va., received invitation for member-
ship in the circle by that group's pe-
culiar method of bidding students.

W. M. Thompson, secretary-treasé
urer of the organization, opened the
exercises with devotional, after which
the speaker of the occasion, Professor
Archibald Currie, was introduced by
Fred Smyre, president of the Delta
Circle, Professor Currie gave the his-
torical background of “the fraternity,
stating that it was founded, at. Wash-
ington and Lee University in 1914 by
a group of the leaders of that college.
Included in that group were two Da-
vidson men, Dr. Henry Louis Smith, a
former president of Davidson College,
and I. P. Davis, well-remembered for
his athletic ability here at Davidson.

“Membership in this fraternity is a
challenge,” said Professor Currie, go-
jing on to state that men were not se-
rected because of whac they had pre-
viously done, but rather because they
possessed those qualities of leadership
which would enable them to do out-
standing work in the future.

After this, the student members of
the circle tapped those men that they
had previously chosen for membership
and the latter signified their accept-
ance by following the student member
to the platform,
orated
and into the
president and secretary.
