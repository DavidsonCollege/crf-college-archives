$700,000 STRUCTURE
HONORS EXECUTIVE

Davidson College will begin con-
struction on a new $700,000 dormi-
tory immediately, President John
R. Cunningham revealed today.

The long-contemplated dormi-
tory will house more than 300
students when completed.

Thompson and Street, contrac-
tors of Charlotte, have set a com-
pletion date of late next year.

Dr. Cunningham said the new
structure would be named the W.
H. Belk Hall in consideration of
the long service of the late Char-
lotte business executive as the
senior trustee of Davidson and of
the gifts of his family and busi-
ness associates.

The new dormitory has been in
the active planning stage since
the mid-forties.

A large, modern dormitory was
given top priority along with a
new gymnasium, church and in-
creased endowment during a 2%
million dollar Development Pro-
gram in the late forties.

Davidson’s gymnasium was dedi-
cated in 1949 and the church in
1952.

In naming the new structure the
W. H. Belk Hall, Davidson is recog-
nizing one of its most faithful and
loyal trustees in history.

The late W. H. Belk, founder of
the Belk Department Store organ-
ization, served es a trustee of Da-
vidson almost constantly from 1928
until his death last year.

Davidson awarded Mr. Belk an
honorary Doctor of Laws degree
during the 1950 Commencement
exercises.

His family and business. asso-
ciates have contributed a substan-
tial portion of the $700,000 re-
quired to build the dormitory.

H. Raymond Weeks of Durham,
architect for the new dormitory,
said the building would feature a
main center hall and two wings.

It will be the central structure
in Dormitory Row and will domi-
nate that end of the campus. It's
total capacity of 304 students will
house more than a third of David-
son’s present student body and
will exceed the total combined ca-
pacity of the two largest dormi-
tories, East and West.

The new hall will also provide
quarters for the ROTC department.
Georgia Dormitory, built in 1910,
will be torn down when the new
structure is completed.

Dr. C. R. Eberhard!
Becomes a F.R.6.5.

Dr. Charles R. Eberhardt, color-
ful Davidson professor of Bible
and authority on Palestine, was
named a Fellow pf the Royal Geo-
graphic Society of London, Eng-
land, during the summer months.

The genial and energetic prof-
fessor was honored principally for
the contributions he has made in
the field of biblical geography.

With his election as a Fellow
of the Society, Dr. Eberhardt
joins a distinguished company.
Among those who have been asso-
ciated with the society are former
President Herbert C. Hoover, the
noted explorers David Livingstone,
Sir Hubert Wilkins and Lincoln
Ellsworth, and the Maharaja of
Nepal and Hogarth of Arabis.

Queen Elizabeth II is patron of
the Royal Geographical Society.

Election to the Society must be
unanimous and follows the per-
sonal recommendation of two Fel-
lows and the careful composition
and subsequent submission of a
candidate's academic and profes-
sional history.

Of particular interest in the rec
ommendation of Dr. Eberhardt’s
membership in the Society was his
extensive color photographs of the
ancient city of Petra, located above
the Jordan Valley of Palestine on
the edge of the Arabian Desert.

The Davidson professor is one
of the few people: who has color-
photographed the entire city,
which was by-passed by Western
civilization for more than a thou-
sand years.

f

lege to the Freshman Class of| :

1953. The Freshman Regulations
will go into operation the first day
the school, and each member of
the Class of 1987 will be expected
to respect them.

Especially important in the
early days of school are regula-
{ions two and nine, regarding the
requirements that freshmen know
the college yells and songs by the
seventh day after school opens and
that freshmen wear their identify-
ing nameplates.

Lists of regulations and fresh-
men caps, required for all fresh-
men, are available at the Student
Store. It is imperative that all
freshmen secure both immediate-
ly,

The regulations as found on
pages 18 and 19 of the Wildest
Handbook are as follows:

1. Freshmen shall show re-
spect to upperclassmen at all
tim

es.

2. Freshmen must know college
yells and songs by the seventh
day after school opens.

3. Freshmen must wear, at all
times, the caps prescribed for
them by the Court of Control.

4 Freshmen shall not walk on
the grass of the Davidson campus.

8. Freshmen shall remain in

Belk Dorm Advances
D. C. Building Program

Belk Dormitory will constitute
the fourth major addition to the
Davidson College campus within
the past five years.

The Johnston Gymnasium, the
new cliurch, and the David Ovens
College Union were all dedicated
between 16948 and 1052. Although
no definite date has been set for
the dedication of the new dormi-
tory it will very likely occur be-
fore the end of 1954, unless un-
forseen difficulties arise.

Davidson is fortunate in having
an excellent college plant, sur-
passed by few comparable schools.
The size and appearance of the
campus and buildings are rather
impressive for a school with a stu-
dent body of 850 or less. For ex-
ample Chambers building, where

most of the classes are held, could | a

easily accommodate an increase of
several hundred above the pres-
ent student body.

Of, course, the construction of
the new gym, church and college
union have greatly enhanced both
the appearance of the campus and
the operation of the college.

The gymnasium, completed in
1949 at a cost of approximately
$750,000 is, for its size, one of the
best-equipped at any college or
university. Naturally, it is smaller
than many, but it is more adequate
for the needs of the Davidson stu-
dent body. It has virtually all types
of facilities that might be found
in any comparable athletic plant
with three regulation basketball
courts, folding stands to accommo-
date over 3,000 apectators when a
varsity game is in progress, a
regulation size swimming pool,

handball courts, a wrestling room,

an exercise room with various
types of exercising apparatus, ete.

The Davidson College Presby-
terian Church, at the southwest
corner of the campus, was com~-
pleted and dedicated in 1952. It
is used by the student botly, but
also has a regular congregation
consisting of residents of the local
community. Vesper services are
held there each Sunday night dur-
ing school. Sunday morning serv-
ices, at which students of all de-
nominations are welcomed, are
also conducted regularly by the
pastor, the Rev. Sam Newell, a
graduate of Davidson himself.

Perhaps the center of attraction
for students, new and old, is the
Ovens Union, which incidentally,
is a “College Union” rather than
“Student Union,” according to
Director Shaw Smith who prefers
the former term because it is in
accord with the recent practice of
identifying the union with the en-
tire college community rather
than with the students alone. This
procedure, says Mr. Smith, will
in no way imply that the students’
use of the building should in any
way be curtailed.

It was dedicated in 1052, but
only this year began full operation
when the cafeteria, snack bar, and
other downstairs facilities were
completed. On the second floor of
the union, which is actually the
third if the cafeteria level is con-
sidered the first, are located meet-
ing rooms and offices of the stu-
dent council, YMCA, and college
publications.

When the new Belk Dormitory
is finished, it will house at least
a third of the student body,

DR. EBERHARDT

An extensive traveler, noted lec-
turer and author of a book on
biblical interpretation, Dr. Eber-
hardt’s most recent trip abroad was
to the Middle East in 1960-51.

A native of Fordham, N.Y., he
performed his undergraduate
work at New York University, re-
ceived both the S.T.B. and S.T.M.
degrees from the Biblicel Semi-
nary in New York, and his Ph. D.
degree from Drew University. He
also performed graduate work at
the University of Edinburg, Scot-
land, and the University of Basel,
Switzerland.

Davidson this fall.
The two are Bruno Eynard of

‘Rome, Htaly, and Erik Ruud of

Oslo, Norway.

Eynard is the son of Bishop Clio
Eynard, President of the Walden-
sian Theological Seminary in
Rome. Rudd comes to Davidson
after having attended the College
International of Cannes, Frances
and the Oslo Commercial College.

As a rule there are two foreign
students on the campus each year.
They are usually classified as spe-
cial students and attend Davidson
only one year. Some, however,
have remained for longer periods.
The college contributes the tuition
and room, while the fraternity con-
cerned supplies meals and neces-

sary expense money.

Schedule; PT Courses

Coach Scott has announced the
schedule of physical fitness and
swimming tests for incoming stu-
dents.

On Tuesday, September 15, the
last day of orientation, all new
men will have swim tests in the
gym.

Physical fitness tests, consisting
of tests in situps, dips, hurdle
runs, shuttle runs, broad jumping
and medicine ball putting, will be
given to new students at thelr
regular gym classes Wednesday
through Saturday.

These physical fitness tests will
determine whether or not new
students must undergo a period
of basic physical training.

Classes in P.T. for upperciass-
men will begin the Monday after
school starts. Fall sports offered
in the classes will be archery, golf,
handball, swimming, tennis, vol-
ley ball and wrestling.

Thirteen Students
From Frosh Class
Get Scholarships

No less than 13 members of the
incoming freshman class are hold-
ers of scholarships whose total
value runs high into the thousands
of dollars. These grants come from
such large scholarship funds as
the Baker and Union Carbide and
from other smaller ones as well.

All the above-mentioned scholar-
ships are non-athletic in nature,
but most are awarded rather on
the basis of all-round achievement,
athletics included.

Perhaps the largest single schol-
arship source outside of athletic
scholarships is the George F.

Dr. Pietenpol Named
Acting Faculty Dean

Dr. C. J. Pietenpol has been

at the close of the 1052-53 term.

A former dean of the faculty
and acting president of Washing-
ton and Jefferson College, Dr.

special assistant to the president
from 1943 until 1945 and was ap-
pointed acting president during
1945-46.

A native of Leota, Minn., he re-
ceived the B.S. degree from the
University of Pittsburg, master’s
degree from the University of
Colorado and his Ph. D. from New
York University.

In addition to Washington and
Jefferson, he also formerly taught
at the University of Wisconsin,
Yale University and Long Island
University.

Dr. Pietenpo! is the author of
the book, “Laboratory Physics,” is
a member of the American Physi-
cal Society, American Association

Baker Trust Fund from which the|:

Baker scholarships are drawn.
Baker scholarships are awarded to
representative colleges and Uni-
versities in the United States.
Those in the South include Van-
derbilt, Sewanee, and, of course,
Davidson.

Baker scholarships are awarded
on the basis of merit in regard to
scholarship, personality, character,
athletic achievement, etc. Usually
about five or six members of each
incoming freshman class have been
Baker scholars since the program
was started in 1948.

Value of awards is determined

by need, the honorary scholarship| :

being the cost of tuition. If, how-
ever, the applicant can show evi-
dence of need, the value of the
scholarship may be upped to as
high as $1200 per year.

The Union Carbide Scholarships
are worth $600 per year and are
annually awarded to two members
of the incoming freshman class
who have the avowed intention
of following a career in business
or industry. They are awarded by
the Union Carbide Company and
are available at many other
schools beside Davidson.

During the course of last year
two Union Carbide scholarships
were also awarded to two members
of the present sophomore class.

Winners of the Baker awards
are: James K. Batten of Holland,
Va.; James C. Bryce of Easley,
8.C.; Carl L. Cooper of Durham,
N.C.; Philip F. Kukura of Deland,
Fla.; and Thomas S. Morgan, Jr.,
of Jackson, Miss.

Union Carbide winners for this
year are William E. Gramley of
Winston-Salem, N.C., and F, Leon
Howell of Copperhill, Tenn.

Honor scholarships given by the
college are held this year by
Michael Fennegan of Fairmont,
N.C.; James G. Martin of Colum-
ble, S.C.; and Alvin P. Perkinson
of Chattanooga, Tenn.

classes Wednesday morning.

HEADS ORIENTATION

MAX DEVANE

According to Dean John C.
Bailey, the major objectives of the
Orientation Program are as fol-
lows:

“1. To give us an opportunity
to give you a physical examination
and certain psychological and sub-
ject matter tests before the col-
lege opens for regular work. The
results of these tests will help us
+o guide you in arranging your
program for the year.

#2, To give us an opportunity
to give you some acquaintance
with the program of the college:
its courses of study, its staff, its
extra-curricular activities, its reg-
ulations, and its traditions.

“3. To give you an opportuni-
ty to become somewhat acquainted
with the buildings and the general
physical setup of the campus, to
select your courses of study, and
to meet some of your advisers be-
fore the upperclassmen return and
work begins.”

The freshman class is divided
into groups of about fifteen men
each. Each of these groups has two
advisers, a faculty adviser, and a
student adviser from one of the
upper classes. The student adviser
will work with his group constantly
throughout the orientation period.
The faculty adviser assists in select-
ing a program of study and will
register students for courses. He
will continue to act as adviser
through the first semester of the
second year. Special advisers are
provided for transfer students.
