I just have two matters of
business to settle before I
start. First I want to tell you
why I am writing for this pa-
per. Well; no I want to tell you
why I’m not writing for this
paper. I’m not writing because
Mark and I are good friends.
Oh, we are friends but that
wouldn’t entice me to write
unless I wanted to which I
don’t. The very thought of
some student reading, relish-

thing. And a favor, I’m doing

should be salmon allowed tn
swim downstream. We are
-luxuries. Our houses should be
‘built for us. And herein lies
my guilt.

I, Larry L. Ligo, A.B.,
B.D. have taken this thing too
far. I suppose all artists have
to look back and take stock
once in a while to see how their
lives are running. It is a
common malady of our species
that we feel from time to time
that we are a drain on the
community. We all feel at one
time or another that we are
swimming downstream too
quickly. I feel this now. I have
accepted too much too gene-
rously and too fast. I do not
lecture in class, J do not make
up my own tests, I did not
build my own house. Students
give oral reports, students
‘make up my tests, students
are still building my house.
My wife Christine cuts my
steak into tiny bites so that I
don’t have a hard time
chewing. My generosity in
accepting these things is...
well, it is Rubenesque! I must
become something. I must do
something. I must write for
this paper.

We are doomed to fail unless
we function as an organic
society. Every man must be
happy .with his work, taking
solace in the fact that he is
getting something done that
contributes to the whole of
society. The lowly swain may
look up from his hog trough

‘and, wiping his face clean with
a tattered sleeve, say, “I am
doing my job the best way I
can. I am irreplacable in the
scheme of totality. I am
useful.” The magnificant mer-
chant, at the pinacle of
haute culture and sparkling
with jewels may say ‘‘I am
rich and I am powerful but
I would not have mutton on
my table if it were not for the
lowly swain, functioning as he
should and.as only he can to
bring about the fully integ-
rated society of labor.”’

We all have our duties, our
abilities, our faults. If we

- could just learn to co-exist in

the truest sense accepting
people for what can do for us
then we will succeed. The
problems. will come when
people are too proud to accept
others’ work.

Wait! What have I stum-
bled upon here? I am a
functioning member of so-
ciety. I accept others work
with real skill. Never congra-
tulatory, never too thankful, I
am the organic man! And
what am I doing? Writing in
this paper and probably step-
ping on the toes of a person
who wants to do this...some-
one with skill for this stuff. I’ll
quit. I hope you enjoyed
finding a Carravaggio in your
attic.

Connors burns track,
Begins calling names

By CHARLES KURALT

In a surprisingly vicious
attack Tuesday, Assistant
Vice President of Develop-
ment Mark Connors called the

WILLIAMS

college ‘‘an institution” and
said that ‘‘a moron could do
Craven’s job.”’ (Craven Will-
iams is Vice President of
Development.)

“‘Craven has done a good
job in his moronic position,
and I speak for everyone when
I say he has helped bring a
little more of Mary Baldwin
down South, but an ape in a
suit would be equally valu-

able. Maybe more so. The

situation is hilarious, Craven
is actually too smart for his
job!,’’ said Connors convul-
sively. tat

Connors’ outburst was re-
corded by The Davidsonian
while Connors was running
around the college track early
Tuesday morning. Williams
had just beaten Connors in a
short race.

I woke up, rolled over and
threw my alarm clock out the
window. She asked me if I was
happy and I said, ‘‘I might be,
but you’ve got something to
do with that.’’ The bitch said,
“I’m following your alarm
clock.”

don’t really know if she
did. I buried my head and
moaned. My sweaty pillow
told me the same story my
head did. I had been to
WHAT A BURGER.

The dead to the world feel-
ing didn’t leave me until mid-
afternoon. I had apparently
thrown up during the night. I
don’t know. It might have
been the bitch. As I began to
realise that life does exist after
death I knew my visit to
What a Burger was over.

‘What a Burger is loca-
ted on Main street in Moores-
ville. For hamburgers it is no
place to go. The milkshakes
are salty. The filet of fish
sandwhiches crunch. You can
blow a bubble with the french
fries. The service is slow and
the plastic straws are clogged.
However, the waitresses make
it all worthwhile, for some. I
have enjoyed many a night
listening to the jukebox play
“Between Lust and the Tele-
vision Set’’ and making my
own urbane choice.

I got out of bed and looked
at my face in the cracked
shaving mirror I stole from
somebody. A sort of crust
surrounded my mouth as if I
had been eating all night. So it
wasn’t the bitch. What a
Burger will do it to you.

My meal the evening before
had consisted of one What A:
Burger and a Sprite that must
have been made to celebrate
the bicentenial of the dis-
covery of carbonation. My

he Joy of Eating

Burger

head became numb, my ton-
gue was loose and I began to
assault the virtues of a wait-
ress. She had seen my type
before and handled me like I
was worthless. I began to
become intrigued and de-

‘manded that she kiss me. She

refused but followed meas I
was leaving.

What A Burger smells like
Lysol and old socks. Even
while I was jawing to the bitch
I could never escape this odor.
It was bad enough to ruin my
appetite but had the qualities
of sensuality that sterile envi-
ronment can’t match. I loved
it, I hated it, and so it was
with the bitch. She intrigued
me.

She knew what she was
doing too. I became aware of
that before I even got to 3rd
gear. She had been around. I
knew. Its just a feeling you
get way down inside that
surfaces in statements like
“Hey, you’re really good, you
know that?”’ ‘‘Yea. I know.
What else is new?”

Nothing was new, and after
that night, nothing would ever
be new again. its not like you
think its going to be, you wake
up with a sweaty pillow after
you went to bed with an angel.
Its the. pits.

The What A Burger decor is
nothing. A juke box provides
entertainment but who needs
the damn thing. The floor is
linoleum and has suffered from
being cleaned semi-weekly
with industrial cleanser.

You may wait in your car,
drive in style if you want to,
but you miss a lot. I didn’t
miss anything. The food made
me ill, but the bitch made me
sick. As I combed my hair and
thought about it. I wasn’t
dead, I was alive, but
changed. As I lick my
wounds, all internal, I ask
that you try What A Burger.
