WRESTLERS
BEGIN SEASON

BACASKIE NONVELL 22.

football season is now
over, and the gridders won't see action
again until next September, when
they'll begin to see plenty of it, meet-
ing Army and Duke in succession.

Right now basketball and wrest-
ling hold sway, and the way the
cagers opened up on Kannapolis
the other ngiht indicates that the
’Cats are headed for a good season.
Coach Unger has been giving his
grapplers plenty to do, and the
boys will get their initial test here
this week against a team from Ap-
palachian College.

Columbia in the Rose Bowl . , ..how
do they get it that way ... look at
Duke, Nebraska, Army, Centenary,
Alabama, and any number . . . we
can’t see it. As Edward V. Mitchell
of “The Greensboro Daily News” so
aptly put it, “Why didn’t dear old
Ypsilanti get the bid?” This column
is still pulling for Oshkosh Normal,
and thinks they deserved the invita-
tion. It doesn’t seem to appear that
Columbia gets to go to the Rose Bowl,
but that they've got to go... stand
by for the slaughter, gang.

We think we have the right of
millions of others, and so here of-
fer our All-America selections, and
don’t expect everyone, or possibly
not anyone, to agree with them.
Here they are: FRIST TEAM:
Ends—Skladany (Pittsburgh) and
Ariall (Auburn), tackles—Ceppi
(Princeton) and Crawford (Duke),
guatds—Huppke (Alabama) and
Corbus (Stanford), center—Ber-
nard (Michigan), quarterback—
Warburton (Southern California),
haflbacks—Purvis (Purdue) and

* Buckler (Army), fullback—Miku-
lak (Oregon). SECOND TEAM:

Ends—Smith (Washington) and

Batchellor (Georgia), tackles—

Schwammel. (Oregon State) and

Krause (Notre Dame), guards—

Jablonsky (Army) and Rosenberg

(Southern California), center—De-

Isola (Fordham), quarterback—

Montgomery (Columbia), half-

backs—Lund (Minnesota) and

Mackorell (Davidson), fullback—

Sauers (Nebraska).

So much then for All-American,
Many other favorites were considered,
and it was hard to leave off men like

Davidson's

“Icehouse” Wilson, of St. Mary’s,
Petroskey, of Michigan, Feathers, of
Tennessee, and Kercheval, of Ken-

tucky, not to mention a host of others.
But there were only 22 positions, and
this writer thinks that Johnny Mack-
orell rates his berth, and the only rea-
son he isn’t on lots of other All-Amer-
icans is that he is in a small college.

Fraternity volleyball was brought
to a close when the K. A. boys
decisively trimmed the Pikas to
take the bunting in this league.
This leaves the Phi Delts in the
lead in the race for the cup, with
the Pikas next in line, followed
by the K. A.’s. Inter-class volley-
ball is beginning this week.

Coach Gene McEver has wired that
he will accept an invitation to coach
the all-star team representing the
southern half of the Southeastern Con-
ference in the charity game with the
northern half to be played in Knox-
ville as a holiday feature. The Da-
vidson mentor, former Tennessee star,
and All-American halfback, will match
wits with a former teammate, also an
All-American, Bobby Dodd, coach at
Georgia Tech, who will be on the staff
to guide the northern eleven.

The players on the varsity foot-
ball team will have a chance to
select the best from the ranks of
their opponents in this issue. We
publish an All-Opponents first and
second team selection, based on a
vote of lettermen, who could be
gotten to turn in teams. This ap-
pears to be the fairest method of
getting such a team chosen, as
the Davidson varsity men have
come up against them in play, and
should know who’s who. There
will be no write-up as to why the
team was chosen, but merely the
list of players, as the editor has
not asked for reasons for choices.

(captain), Pratt, Sprunt, Bowman
Downie, Duff, Johnson and Hutaff.

The following composed the Pika

The match was not completed Mon-

ball teams in the history of Davidson

As yet the Wildcat schedule is in-
complete, but it is thought that it will
be similar to the 1933 card with Army
replacing Wofford. | This is a big as-
signment Davidson's
size, but the ‘Cats will put on eleven
on the field next year that will be no
casy meat for anybody.

At present Coach Newton plans to

Davidson Wrestlers

Open Against W. & L.

Shortly after the Christmas recess,
the Davidson wrestling team, that has

been under the tutelage of Coach
“Doc” Unger for the last several
weeks, will open its season. The sea-

son opens with a two-day invasion of
the Old Dominion, where the Wildcat
grapplers will meet Washington and
Lee, January 12, and Virginia Military
Institute the following night.

Two foes that were not on the sched-
ule last year appear on the ‘Cats’ 1934
eard, namely, V. M. I. and N. C. State.
Franklin and Marshall, who defeated
Davidson last season, does not reap-

Washington and Lee, which was the
only other team to lick the ‘Cats last
season, is again on the card, as are
V. P. I. and Duke, both defeated by
Davidson, and the University of North
Carolina, who wrestled the local grap-
plers to a 14-14 draw in the Tin Can
at Chapel Hill.

Only ones meet, that with the Caro-
lina Tar Heels, is carded for the local
mat, five foes being met on their own
the foe, N. C.,
State, is to be met in a place yet to
be determined. If either Davidson or
