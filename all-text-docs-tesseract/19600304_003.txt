The Southern Conference Wrestling Tournament
will be held here in Johnston Gymnasium tomorrow and
Monday. Originally scheduled for/Friday and Saturday,
the meet was postponed for a day because of bad travel-
ing conditions caused by the snow. The first session will
get under way at 2:00 tomorrow afternoon, with the
semi-finals coming at 8:00 tomorrow night. The consola-
tions will be held at 2:00 on Monday and the finals are

CHARLESTON, S. C. —

THE DAVIDSONIAN itearn-
ed this afternoon thet Davjd-
son stands a distant third af-
ter the two opening day
events. VMI leads with 17
points, followed by VPI with
14 and Davidson with six.
Citadel, a pre-meet favorite
has not scored.

‘Tom Hudgins took fourth
in the 1500 meters and Bar-
ry Eranch was fourth in the
200 yard individual medley.
Both Davidson divers have
made the semi-finals:

Coach Dwight Shoe said
that his team still has an
outside chance to win, David-
son’s strongest events being
, scheduled today. “It alf de-
pends on how we do today,”
Shoe said. “The top three
teams now should be pretty
close.”

The semi.finals are slated
for tonight with the finals
fomorrow.

As Coach Dwight Shoc re-
flected last Saturday after the
Catfish dropped a squeaker at
The Citadel, “Some meets you
win; some you lose; and the
others are rained out.”

iis squad its pitted against
three conference powerhouses:
VMI, Citadel and VPI. Virginia
Military is favored.

Judging from regular season
splashes, however, you would
hesitate to pick a winner. Dav-
idson has been beaten twice, by
VMI and The Citadel. VMI has
Jost only to VPI. And the Wild-
cats hold a win over the Gob-
blers. The Citadel has yet to
face either VMI or VPI.

So the Catfish-Cadet clash in
Charleston last Saturday pro-
vided Citadel’s only proving
ground for the loop meet held
yesterday, today and tomorrow.

The Citadel had been predict-

barrier was to have been the
first event of the evening, the
400 yd. medley relay.

Both coaches figured the rest
of the events would fall into
place with the Wildcats win-
ning half of them.

But a Davidson relay team
of Tom Smith, Slephen Young,
George Gabel and anchorman
Barry Branch failed to stop the
Cadets. Their time of 4:14.5 was
three seconds better than Dav-
idson’s time.

“That lost the mect for us,”
one of the Catfish offered.

The medley upset was such a
blow to Davidson spirits that
the Wildcats were trailing 32-11
after the diving event.

‘It looked Jike a long, up-hill
climb from that point.

But, making a _ desperate
comeback and breaking three
school records, the Wildcats
pulled even with Citadel, 44-44,
with the 400 yd. freestyle relay
remaining.

Records that fell were:

The 100 yd. freestyle by Bar-
ry Branch, a time of 53.7, pass-
ing the 1957 record time of 53.8
by Tommy Rivers.

The 200 yd. backstroke Oy eae brigh week. Thurs-
day was bright and sunny—

Tom Smith, 2:22.7, passing his

2:23.2.

The 200*yd. breaststroke by
Captain John Scott, 2:39.2, pass-
ing his own 1959 record of
2:40.4.

Scott and Stephan Young
were the central cogs in the
comeback wheel. Both swam in
the 200 yd. breaststroke and
the 200 yd. butterfly, and both
took first and second places,
respectively, for 16 points.

ALMOST OVERLOOKED in the bustle of a nearly-
snowbound Southern Conference Wrestling tournament
here this weekend is the conference’s championship
rifle match, which will decide the official title-holder
in the Southern loop. ‘

As far as we know, this is the first time two
co:ference tournaments have been held at the same
school at the same time—at least recently. Students
e371 observe action on the firing line free of charge
from 8:00 tomorrow morning until 4:00 in the after-
noon, when the awards will be made. it should be a
good show.

COACH TED KEESLER’S young tennis team will
play one of the roughest schedules in the South this
spring. The slate includes Miami, perennially one of the
best in the nation, Carolina (twice), Duke, Presbyterian—
consistently the best small college team around, and

conference champion George Washington.

Keesler has had his crew on the courts since the
begining of the semester trying to work up a winning
combination. Whit Cobb, ox-Wildcat star and former
tennis coach at Duke was here early in the week to
help Keesler smooth off some rough edges.

Big Ted doesn’t seem to be too worried about
that nurderous schedule—says itl! do his boys some
good in the long run. But Charlie Parker swears he
was out trying to shovel the snow off the upper courts
last Wednesday morning.

LITTLE HUGH MURRAY took: top honors in the
Big Five Indoor Track Meet in Chapel Hill’s Tin Can
last Saturday afternoon. Hugh won the broad jump over
athletes from Duke, UNC, State and Wake Forest, and
sparked Davidson to a fourth place finish in front of

e Deacons.

Other Davidson scorers were John Chiles—fourth
in the broad jump, Pat Curry, fourth in the 70-yard
high and low hurdles, and the mile relay team, which
finished fourth. This was quite an eccomplishment
for Coach Whittle’s indoor crew, considering the
competition and the fact that the only indoor track
we have here is the main hall in Chambers building.
