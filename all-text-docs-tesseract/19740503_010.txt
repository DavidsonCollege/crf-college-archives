Bas

eballers Split Two

With Tough Foes

By MARK WILENSKY

Davidson’s baseball team
split a pair of games this
week, losing to tough Pfeiffer
12-3 on Saturday before
defeating Southern Con-
ference foe Furman 5-2 on
Tuesday.

Pfeiffer, ranked as one of
the nation’s top 20 small
College teams, had to come
from behind to tag lefty Ross
Manire with the defeat.
Manire started strong, but the
hard hitting Pfeiffer lineup ex-
ploded for 12 runs on 10 hits
over the last six frames.

Manire shut out Pfeiffer on
just one hit over three innings.
He struck out five over this
span allowing only one man to
reach second. He stranded two
runners in the second, and ap-
peared to be in complete con-
trol.

Meanwhile, Davidson’s bat-
ters went to work early. Dave
Ingold led off with a single and

scored on Mitch Stone’s sharp
line triple to right center. In
the third Gary Pomeroy, bat-
ting lefthanded, drove a pitch
just over the fence in right,
running the Cat lead to 3-0.

Manire’s first trouble came
in the fourth. After a walk,
Ross got two quick outs on a
fly to left and strikeout. A
double put men on second and
third, and consecutive errors
by third baseman Dave Year-
wood and Manire himself cost
the Cats their unearned runs.

In the fifth, a single, a
sacrifice, two walks, a wild
pitch and Dave Ingold’s error
kayoed Manire. Dwight Plem-
mons came in and gave up
three singles before stopping
the uprising. Pfeiffer got four
runs on three hits with two Cat
errors in that frame.

A Yearwood error gavé
Pfeiffer an unearned run in
the sixth, and errors by him
and Pomeroy coupled around
a base hit plated two more in
the eighth. The Pfeiffer
scoring was closed out on an

unearned run in the ninth, the
run with the help from Dave
Mayberry’s miscue in the left
field.

The Cats bats, so active in
the first three frames, were
completely muted. Their only
hit over the last five innings
was Ingold’s leadoff double in
the eighth. He was left at third
as Stone struck out and
Pomeroy and George Weicker
went.qut on infield bounces. .

Manire went 4% innings,
with Plemmons finishing up.
Each pitcher allowed six runs,
but only three were earned.
Their control and stuff were
good, but the horrendous play
of the Davidson fielders put
them at an insurmountable
disadvantage.

In Greenville on Tuesday,
Coach Tom Stevens sent ace
Joel Tew out to face the
Paladins. Tew had been ex-
tremely sharp of late, but had
no control on this day. He
walked five men early, and
left with one out in the fourth.

Ingold drew a 3-2 walk to
