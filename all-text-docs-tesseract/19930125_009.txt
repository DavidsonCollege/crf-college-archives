Let's Talk About It

By Marilyn Ambroise

When I arrived at Davidson I
was an idealist. I remember my
first days in the Commons, like I
remember yesterday. Often, at din-
ner my new “friends” called me an
idealist. Soon the term idealist
became synonymous with the term
weird. And later, my sense fo
weirdness was dismissed as a
Northern characteristic.

As the days went by, I began
to realize where I was and what
was happening: I guess you could
say, I had a revelation. I began to
ask myself if I belonged in an insti-
tution compa-

myself. On rare occasions, I would
have profound conversations with
very sincere indivuals. Often these
very sincere indivieduals said,
“Marilyn, if you are not part of the
solution, you are part of the prob-
lem.” -For five semesters, I medi-

tated on those words.’ I began to -

confess them. A good man, by the
name of Kenneth Hagin once re-
minded me, ‘““When you believe a
thing in your heart and confess it
with you mouth—then it becomes
real to you.” Gradually, I cam to

realize what the problem was.
“What problem?”, youare still
asking? Well,

Py.

rable to
Davidson. As
I spoke to sev- -
eral members
of the faculty,

"Well, the problems are too
many to list in this single
article.”

the problems are
too many to list
in this single ar-
ticle. So for the
weeks to come,

staff, and stu-
dent body
about my concerns, I was encour-
aged to transfer. Obviously, I did
not take their advice because, her I
sit, writing this article.

Many of you might be asking
atthis point, “Why didn’t you trans-
fer?” At that time I did not con-
sider transferring an ideal resolu-
tion. “What do I mean by that?”
Well, I didnot havea way of know-
ing for sure if I would bump into
the very things that I was running
from at another college, In other
words, I did not want to escape
from the issues and questions that
I have experienced at Davidson.
For I knew thatif I ever planned to
turn out well in this society, run-
ning away could never be the an-
swer.

So as more days went by, I
decided to keep my opinons to

look for my ar-
ticles in the
Davidsonian. Try not to view me
as a person who does nothing more
than complain. I realize that I
mightbe asking too much from the
majority of you, but please keep an

‘open mind.

“What willl talkabout?” Very
simply, the issues. Whatever you
think could fit under that category,
I will discuss. But, let me warn you
that some will get very offended
by whatI have to say. When some-
one has to say what I have to say,
many do not like it. The truth
hurts. But, someone once said,
“Silence implies approval.” There-
fore, I have to speak. Many of you
will feel the need toretaliate. Great!
Iam notan advocate of trouble, but
of dicussion and communication.
The circumstances demand we talk.
So let’s talk!

Nomenclature Disease

When I first began writing for
The Davidsonian, there were only
two other regular columnists, and
only one of those columns fea-
tured a clever title. Today, there
are many columnists, and none of
them feature clever titles.

Does anyone remember how

one, though in retrospect I can see
that the common denominator was
sheer, unadulterated sex appeal.
But revenge was Mr. Frampton’s.
He gave one of my more serious
columns theheadline “Open Minds
Are Cool.” Thanks, Chris. No
really, thanks.

Reflections: College So Far

Now is an appropriate time to
reflect upon my first semester in
college, where everything changes
and our future takes shape.

Moving into 312 Watts was a
helluva chore. The three ashtrays
Thad brought from home needed to
be strategically placed so that I
could smoke on the phone, in bed,
by the sink, on the floor, and
anywheare else I wanted to. The
good part was that this was basi-
cally all I had to do. My mom set
up the computer, everyone outside
carried our stuff up for us, and
everything else fell into place. I
was a college student.

Davidson is hard, they said.
You'll have to work, they cau-
tioned. All this running through
my head, I almost booted when I
found out I had Humes homework
before class even started. I found
that Davidson is hard.

After the perfunctory (big
word) and expected first month of
hedonism, I worked and learned
more than I expected to. Exam
time was difficult, but rewarding,
as my “I'll study when a gun is at
my head” mentality turned into
“T’ll study now and puta gun tomy

head when my grades come” atti-
tude.

The library was a blast during
this period. The third week of
school I needed directions to get to
the smoking lounge, but by exam
time it was my second home. It
was also neat because I fell down
the stairs and everyone clapped,

"The third week of school
I needed directions to the
smoking lounge, but by
exam time it was my
second home.”

think I had tried to do it on purpose
and wasn’t just a clumsy buffoon.
They must have thought the guy
who did it on purpose later was
either a poser or an uncoordinated
klutz.

Another thing I had heard
about was the Honor Code. It
struck me as naive. But on the
second day when my -professor
gave a quiz and left the room it was
putto the test. Weall stared ateach
other, laughed a little bit, and
looked straight down and took our

Deep Thoughts...
The United States Can Learn

From Other Countries' Problems

This semester I am taking a
seminar on U.S.-Central Ameri-
can Relations. In the first meeting,
Dr. Ralph Levering pointed out
several of the key features that
characterize the tragic region to
our south of which so many of us
know so little. Some of these traits
resemble problems that currently
besiege the United States: endemic
political corruption, a tendency
toward violence, and the lack of
national unity. I believe the latter
element underlies the other two, in
both the countries to our south as
well as our own. Levering pointed
out that the United States is pres-
ently at risk of devolving into a
region similar to Central
America— truly multicultural on
the one hand, but beset by an un-
stable economic system anda gov-
ernment that thrives on milking
the average worker on the other.
This lack of national unity is in-
deed America’s deepest-rooted
ailment and one which deserves
the majority of our attention in the
coming decades.

Aseach year passes, thiscoun-
try becomes increasingly diverse,
with the influx of foreign peoples
and cultures as well as the be-
grudging acceptance (often forced
upon American society by Civil
Rights legislation) of those who
have for centuries been repressed
by white male society. In some
ways this is good because it forces

“us as a society to widen our per-

spective of other cultures and en-
rich our understanding of what
makes us all human. This process,
however, is not without its nega-

tive elements. By forcing estab-
lished societal precepts to change
and become more inclusive, we
often throw out what was ever good
about those precepts to begin with.
Those who benefitted in the estab-

lishment feel at risk of losing their
slice of the pie. They react by grasp-
ing for more than their share, at the
expense of those around them, in
order to regain their former sense
of security. Those who have been
denied any of the pie uptonow feel
justified in taking more than their
share now. Both groups react out
of fear, forgetting their responsi-
bilities and their regard for the
welfare of their neighbors.

We have just witnessed the
fruition of this type of mentality in
the 1980s with the cult of greed

quiz (which I failed).

It was an incredible feeling to
see the code in action and working
like it was supposed to. From then
on, I never doubted it. My folks
thought I was bluffing when they
asked me how Ididonanexam and
couldn’t tell them, but the darn
thing worked after all. I’m proud
to be a part of it.

Another great occurfence was
the Coastal Carolina game. We all
know what it is like and I won’t
cheapen it with my inferior de-
scriptive skills, but it was
ubelievable. As the old song goes,
“We'll have these moments for-
ever but never again.”

All in all it-has been a great
semester. Maybe I should have
done more work, but I plan to getat
least a 3.3 GPA from now on.
Davidson is all it’s cracked up to
be. We have a sensational student
body, acapable faculty, a beautiful
campus, Commons, and excellent
facilities. All we need are cigarette
machines, especially in my dorm
and in the Patterson Court houses.
Hey, you drink, you smoke.

and the glorification of the indi-
vidual consumer. We have also
seen how this type of culture breeds
social problems, as people step
across ethical boundaries in order
to get more than their share. These
instances range from the simple
cheating on one’s taxes to the co-
lossal trend of underhanded busi-
ness dealings and governmentcor-
ruption. All of this was part of the
package that came with the 1980s.
Perhaps now we = are
beginnning to swing away from
this rapacious consumerism, but
many of the symbols of -former
times still remain. This week in
Sports Illustrated, for instance,
Rick Reilly wrote a poignant ar-
ticle on the lack of sportmanship in
today’s athletics. He writes,
“SO, WHO KILLED SPORTS-
MANSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY?
Was it the Atlanta Falcons’ Deion
Sanders, who thinks it’s great fun
to high-step the final 20 yards of a
touchdown run just to embarass
the poor players chasing him? Or
was it his teammate Andre Rison,
who loves to perform his High-
light Zone strut after every touch-
down, no matter what the score?”
Reilly goes on to cite multiple ex-
amples from figures in all facets of
the sporting world (and not neces-
sarily associated with the Falcons)
who promote this same attitude of
me before you, whether friend or

‘foe. Such behavior mirrors on a

small scale the dilemmas facing
Central American countries today.
There each ethnic group is con-
