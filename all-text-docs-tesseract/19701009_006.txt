Davis: Burts Mustn’t See Records

By WINDY MARCH
Staff Writer

Dr. William Dawvis,-coll ge
physician, said Monday 1 at
the present system of handl-
ing student medical records
forces him to violate profes-
sional_ethics, and has _led
the infirmary to neglect stu-

dents with drug problems.

Under the present system,
Davis said, the records,
which are kept on tapes, go
to the office of the dean of
students to be typed, since
there is simply not time for
the infirmary staff to type
the records.

The dean of students has

Publicity Aimed
At Court’s Image

By ALEC HOON
Staff Writer

The Honor Court, react-
ing to recent complaifts
about its methods and ef-
fectiveness of ‘the honor
code, has recently responded
with discussions and par-
phlets aimed at improving
the court’s tarnished image.

Junior John Porter, a
members of the Honor Court,
said, ‘‘To make the honot
system more effective, it
must be givea some publici
ty.” iY

The discussions and pam-
phlets will definé the work-
ings of the Court and Code
and hopefully stimulate
open discussion on the mer-
its and failings of the sys-
tem.

Porter felt that there
could be two worthwhile re
sults of the publicity. The
first would be a more gen-
eral understanding of Honor
Code offenses among mem-
bers of the student body,
hopefully leading to a reduc-
tion in the number of viola-
tions.

Porter also hopes that a
more éffective Honor Code
will result from the consi-
deration of new ideas.

The first discussions were
held in September in each
of the freshmen residence
halls, Moderated by mem-
bers of the court, the dis-
cussions ranged from _ out-
lining the provisions of the
Code to the judicial proces-
ses of the Court itself.

main reasons
for these sessions was to
famillarize freshmen with
the Code early in the year
so that they would not
blunder ito a violation.

One of the

An qpen question and
answer session is now being
tentatively planned to dis-
cuss the honor _ system,
focusing on where it needs
improvement and why.

The Honor. Court hopes
that this session -will pro-
duce: constructive criticism
which can then be used to
evaluate the whole system.

To help the student- under-
stand the feelings of individ-
ual professors on the honor
system, the Honor Court
sent out letters last week to
all teachers urging them to
make their position clear on
testing and) laboratory data.

The letter$ asked that pro-
fessors remind students not
to bring books or notes into

Chass on the day: of a review.

With regard to labs, the
letters asked professors to
make sure that their | indi
vidual lab policies are clear-
ly understood by their stu-
dents. é

A pamphlet is now being

written on the honor sys-

tem with explanations on the
way it works and on trial

procedure,
In addition, the Honor
Court recently has been

meeting to discuss possible
changes in the code. A mock
trial was held last Thurs-
day for the purpose of fa-
riarizing new court mem-
bers with the trial process.

Porter said that full co-
operation of all students is
necessary if the Honor Court
is to ‘“‘function smoothly and
to be a {sitive orce at Da-
vidson. "\ He vited the
‘questions, suggestions, and
criticisms'’ of interested

persons.

. free access to the records,
and: this, said Davis, is a
violation of ethical prac-
tices, by which all récords
should be — strictly confi-
dential.

Davis said he knew of at
least two cases of students
on bad trips: last year who
went to hospitals in Char-

lotte rather than to the in-

fear of having
records exposed.

firmary, for
their

He suggested that there
might be cases of students
who simply do not seek
medical help for drug_ prob-
lems for the same _ reason.

In case of venereal dis-
ease, said Davis, the nurses
in thé office type the re-
cords. To send such records
elsewhere he said would

simply be too great a viola-.

tion of privacy.

A part-time secretary in
his office, Davis said, would
solve the problem. Since he
began- practice at--Davidson
College, he has been trying
to make such, an arrange-
ment.

The principle objection to
this, sald Davis, comes from
Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts Jr.

Davis said Burts wants
access to the files in order
to know if a student will
miss schoolwork as a result
of illness,

A meeting has been
arranged between Davis,
Burts, and college president
