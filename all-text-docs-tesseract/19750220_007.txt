“We have beaten Georgia
Tech, East Carolina University,
and Presbyterian College,
among others. Georgia Tech
was our biggest win of the year.
We scored the most in three
years and won. 1277-1199. Our
worst defeat was to the Citadel,
who beat us 1356 (out of a
possible 1500) to 1198. That is

the second best member (under
Sims) at the Citadel match.
‘‘Ann Bode has shot with us in
three matches, and is scoring in
the low 200s. She is really good
for morale,”’ White enthused.

At the Georgia Tech match
the Davidson team had all five
of its best shooters present.
Predicted White, ‘‘If we can do

cidence to some of you, but I
know better. The whole story
will be revealed at some future
date.

The IMAC tourney started
last week and it has been ex-

elimination for the first two
rounds, but once the quar-
terfinals were attained, it
became a double elimination
tourney.

There were no surprises in

set by IFT 66-62. Ken Schmader
went berserk and scored 27
while the Thi zone kept Marty
Williamson and Chris Young
under control. Undoubtedly,
this upset was the biggest sur-

White declared.

White said that the team has
been greatly strengthened by
the addition of sophomore Ben
Sims, ‘‘Ben shot a good bit in
high school but didn’t join the
team last year. Now he is pro-
bably the best shooter of the
team.
