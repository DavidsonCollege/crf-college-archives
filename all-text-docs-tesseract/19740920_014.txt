Harper Maintains Constanc

Amidst Football Variables

By CHARLES KENNON
Asst. Managing Editor
Much has been said about
the current “new era” in
Davidson athletics, and foot-
ball is the most dramatic
example of the break with the

past.

Head Coach Ed Farrell and
his staff are all new, the
schedule has been mercifully
downgraded, and:the Wildcats
no longer must play the role of
under-suppoited Davids every
Saturday.

Few people could be more
attuned to this change and
what it signifies than Senior
David Harper, the Wildcat

ck. ‘‘We are trying .

to make a clean break with the
past,” Harpersaid.
‘ “Football had been a source
of controversy because of the
scholarship issue, and now
that that isn’t an issue we hope
for much better support from
the faculty and administration
as well as the students, ” he ex-
plained.

Prior to the current season
Davidson had given standard
football scholarships. Now
players may only be awarded
grants based on need in the
same manner that other:
students may receive them.

Harper feels that the new
grant policy is just one
drawing card that the Wild-
cats hold.“‘The new coaching
staff has fit in perfectly here,
and football is no longer
isolated from the rest sid the
community.

_ “They have helped us
realize that we now have a
great winning potential,” he
observed.

Alterations in the recruiting
policy of all NCAA schools will
benefit Davidson’s efforts in
that area, Harper believes.
The new guidelines allow for
only thirty scholarships to be
given for football.

He expects that the big
schools will now-have to be
much more selective in their
recruiting. This would allow
Davidson to choose from a
larger field of good athletes.

“We can pick up boys who

normally would be considered

by Notre Dame or Nebraska,”’
according to Harper.

He added that ‘here they
will get to play whereas

. somewhere else they would
just sit on the bench. And
Davidson stresses academics
so that they'll study too.”

Harper feels that this side of
the athletic program at David-
son is highly commendable
and a plus in recruiting ef-
forts.

Optimism about the new
season is centered on more
thana new coaching staff and
the discontinuation of scholar-
ships. At the end of last season
Harper was third in the nation
in passes completed per
game, for a total of 1885 yards.

The two players above him.

have graduated, leaving Har-
per the country’s ‘‘best’’
returning passer. He warned
against expectations of so fine
a performance this year

“In the second half of last

season we decided to throw
more and our offense clicked. |
We played much better foot-

“Ourline has developed a lot .
this year,’’ he continued.
“Last year it was a weak spot
but now we plan on them

several yards downfield.

“This will make it easier to
get-at least the short yardage
every time, and it gives better
protection for the pass. Last
year our running game didn’t
work until the last bame - with
the Citadel - and we won.
There should be a lot more of
that this year. C

Harper views last year as
something of a basis for lear-
ning.

He said both his ability and
attitude improved. ‘‘Early
last year we didn’t score many
points and our team was sup-
posed to be based on offense.

“I had doubts about my
ability as a player,” he said.
“But you have to forget about
the last game and prepare for
the next. It taught me not to
get wrapped up in worrying.”

Harper indicated that last
year’s style of razzle-dazzle
offense will be absent this
season.

“This team is undergoing a

fresh start. Really, we are °

going back to fundamentaals.
Coach Farrell is meticulous.
He strives for details. He is
aiming for a_ top-notch
program. How soon we. have
one is up to us,”’ Harper feels.

According to Harper, no
hard feelings have come from
the departure of Dave Fagg
and the abrupt shifting of foot-
ball styles at Davidson.

“T want to make this clear -
we love Coach Fagg and are
happy to hear that he is doing
wel at Georgia Tech. He had a
dynamic personality.

“The new situation is
working out well. No one
should judge the team from
the old system,” he em-

Dave Harper almost didn’t
make it to Davidson, because
he didn’t know it wanted him.

“I thought about playing at
VMI, but not for long. David-
son was late in getting in touch
with me, but they did and it
has worked out all right.””

The Wildcats open their
season here Saturday against
Appalachian. Harper says the
team is looking forward to it
with a vangence.

“They have won their first
two games, and they beat us
badly last year: So they are a
good test of our new
program.”

Harper expressed a note of
caution concerning the first
part of the season. -

“But we have a good team,

and we will play sound football
to prove it.”
