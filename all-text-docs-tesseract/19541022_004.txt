Freshman Fellowship
Groups To Organize

The Freshman Council is orga-
nizing Freshman Fellowship
Groups, which will be groups of
from ten to fifteen students each
with one upper class adviser. These
groups will meet once every two
weeks at a place designated by
their upper clas8 adviser. The pur.
pose of these groups is fourfold.

The first purpose is to help in
the betterment of faculty-student
relations. The second purpose is
to provide leadership training for
those who take part. The third,
and probably the most. important,
is to promote fellowship among the
students. The final purpose is to
acquaint the Freshmen with some
of the problems they will face and
try to offer some solutions to
them, through informal discussion
groups on suggested topics. Some
of these topics include; dating,
religion, vocations.

All Freshmen interested in this
program may sign up in the YMCA
Office.

Honor seniors will still be re-

Federal regulations. Proponents
called the measure an incentive
to scholarship in the true sense
of the liberal arts. Scholastically
