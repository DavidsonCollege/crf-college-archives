Ah, shucks...
Wrestler hopes to :
qualify for NCAA tourney

It’s called the shuck.

It is a wrestling move used mostly by
heavyweights, but Davidson junior Jeff
Libersat has used it to overwhelm many of his
opponents this season in the 184- pound weight
class.

Here’s how it works: Libersat will wait for
his opponent to make an aggressive push for
position. When that happens, Libersat side-

Week, Jan. 10 sters Libersat’s

hopes to earn.a
berth in the NCAA tournament, which is

what brought him to Davidson three years
ago.

Libersat, a Jenkinstown, Pennsylvania, na-
tive, began his wrestling career at Chestnut
Hill Academy. He was one of the team’s top
wrestlers, but not quite good enough to com-
pete at a large Division I school. Davidson
was a perfect fit.

“I knew the Southern Conference would be
a good conference to wrestle in to reach the
NCAA tournament,” he said.

As a freshman, he finished in third place in
the conference in the 167-pound weight class
with a 20-8 record.

The next year, he transferred to the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania to wrestle in a better
league and be closer to home. He says he was
overwhelmed by the grueling practice sched-
ule and difficult competition in the Ivy League,
so he transferred back to Davidson, where he
sat out another year due to injury and the loss
of eligibility that comes with transferring
twice.

Having rededicated himself to the sport
and to Davidson, Libersat says he worked
harder than ever this fall and has shed any rust
that might have built up over two years of
inaction.

His routine before matches is low-key.

“] just try to get someplace quiet and think.
I think about winning,” he said. “Inever think
I am going to lose going into a match. You
have to believe that you’re going to win.”

Head coach Tom Oddo is excited about
Libersat’s chances this season, but says he’s
still got some work to do.

“He’s gota shot,” Oddo said. “He will be in
condition physically; it’s just a matter of him
developing a second and third move that he
can pull on the tougher opponents that will be
ready for the ‘shuck.’ Once they realize that
he relies so heavily on this move, they will
shut him down.

“If he can adapt over the next few weeks,
he will be able to beat those tougher oppo-
nents.”

Diving into the CAA

This season marked the Colonial Athletic Association
debut of the Davidson Swimming & Diving teams

By JENN HIGGINs
Staff Writer.

A possibility once considered dead by
Davidson Athletics Director Jim Murphy
was resurrected in part this year when the
Davidson swimming and diving program
became an official member of the Colonial
Athletic Association. ,

After being courted for more than two
years, Davidson athletic officials last spring
decided not to make the move into the CAA.

The final verdict came as the result of
much deliberation over the issues of ex-

talented in the history of Davidson swim-
ming. Its graduation and the departure of
long-time head coach Rich DeSelm left the
swim team with plenty of new challenges to
face this season: Finding a new coach, re-
cruiting new swimmers, attempting to keep
swimmers on the team, the struggles of join-

ing anew conference, problems with facili- |

ties.

Beginning this season one could say that
the Davidson men’s and women’s swim
teams had little to be optimistic about.

A young team. A new conference. A new
coach. This is the true definition of ‘“‘a re-
building year.”

instability within the next
two years. Geographic lo-
cations of the member in-
stitutions as well as the
fact that three of the nine
schools were preparing to
make moves of their own
within the next two years
also influenced the deci-
sion.

And while a move to
the CAA was recognized
as unfavorable for David-
son athletics as a whole,
the men’s and women’s | y
swim teams have been| &
afforded the opportunity
to take their program to
the next level in a legiti- | yy :

The CAA offers anum-
ber of things that will ultimately improve a
blossoming Davidson swimming program.
It is more competitive, more recognized
than the Southern Conference, it allows for
a higher level of recruiting.

The biggest plus is that it finally makes
this Davidson swimming team part of an
official conference.

“We are proud that we are actually in a
conference now and that future teams will
have the ability to become a dominant force
in a competitive Division I conference,”
said senior co-captain Kurt Hirsekorn.

Hirsekorn alludes to the future of David-
son swimming in the CAA with confidence.

competition is something Davidson swim-
ming is ready for.”

This year, for the first time, Wildcats’
swimmers will experience their first confer-
ence championship meet. And unlike other
years, they are not going in as favorites to
win.

Although the roster is small compared to
recent years, Hirsekorn says the team is
proof that strength isn’t necessarily always
in numbers.

It is found, he-says, within those deter-
mined to-make the most of their chance to
grow as a team.

“When you are in a program that is good
and then are forced into a program that is
better,” Hirsekorn says. “How can you ever
complain?”

Change is good. For the Davidson men’s _
swim team, it proved a powerful catalyst
Saturday afternoon as the Wildcats beat Col-
lege of Charleston 115.4-114.5 in Canon
Pool.

“Some folks swam events that they
wouldn’t have usually,” head coach Tom
Conlon said. “But Charleston didn’t have
enough swimmers for some events, soI knew
that we could fill some empty lanes and pick
up extra points.”

The one-point victory marked the first win
of the season for the men’s team, which has
struggled to remain competitive in a season
filled with much larger opponents. But things
evened out Saturday.

“T knew it would be tight,” said Conlon,
referring to Saturday’s outcome. “We (David-
son and College of Charleston) are compa-
rable in talent and in numbers.

It was nice to be on equal footing, so to
speak, after swimming against big schools
like East Carolina and Georgia Tech.”

Going into the final two events of the meet,
the men's score was all even at 97.5. Senior
Kurt Hirsekorn took the penultimate event,
the 200 breast, with a time of 2:06.92 helping
Davidson (1-7) build a 10-point cushion go-
ing into the 400 free relay. Senior Matt
Clifford, juniors Nick Blackwell and Steve
Reece, as well as freshman Robert Koch
secured the men's first victory of the year by
placing second in the relay.

“Tt was very relieving to get the win,” said
Hirsekorn. “Wereally wanted to get a win for
the seniors before we all left.”

Concoln echoed Hirsekorn’s sentiments,
saying that the team considered the victory a
“gift to the seniors.”

The leadership of Hirsekorn, along with
co-captain Graham Gravely, has helped keep
the swimmers focused after a tough fall sea-
son, according to Conlon, but Hirsekorn
doesn’t feel that way.

“The captains and the seniors have known
that it is important to keep things together,
especially early when we didn’t have acoach
or a pool.

“But everybody is swimming so well right
now that our leadership is a complement to
this team rather than any kind of outright
necessity.”

The women’s dominating 155-86 victory
over the Cougars is more evidence in support
of Hirsekorn’s claim. The women clinched
the victory with three events left to swim.

Led by a trio of two-event winners, the
team captured eight of the possible 13 events.
Junior Kendra Berner won the 200 free and
100 free, with the Wildcats (3-6) finishing
second and third in those events too. In the
distance events (500 and 1000 free), fresh-
man Erin Rosintoski came away with first-
place finishes. Freshman Sara Laws earned
victories in the 400 IM and 200 back, while
freshman Carrie Rafer edged out her sister,
Brandy, amember of the Cougars, for second
in the 200 back. Rounding out the individual
victors was freshman Vanessa Witt, as she
won the 200 breaststroke event.

“We had a lot of really good swimmers,”
said Rosintoski, whose victory in the 500-
meter freestyle helped clinch the Wildcats’
victory. “We knew that every point counted
so we tried to remember that every race,
every finish was important.”

The Wildcats now look ahead to their last
meet of the season at Duke, a team both the
men and women beat last year. Following the
Duke meet, Davidson will being preparing
for the Colonial Athletic Association Cham-
pionships Feb. 21-24.
