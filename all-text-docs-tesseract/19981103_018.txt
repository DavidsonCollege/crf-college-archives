Fans of the men’s basketball team
should be very excited about the rapidly
approaching season.

After last year’s amazing run to
the NCAA tournament, the Wildcats
will again play a challenging non-con-
ference schedule, perhaps the toughest
of any Southern Conference team.

The docket features six tourna-
ment teams from last year as well as a
road matchup with ACC power Wake
Forest, which participated in last year’s
National Invitational Tournament.

The Wildcats also have two games
scheduled to be televised nationally on
espn2.

“This schedule is going to chal-
lenge us early,” coach Bob McKillop
said. “It will require us to be ready
earlier in the season than we normally
have to be, but this is the year to do that
because we depend so much on our
juniors and seniors.”

The highlight of the schedule is
the opener against Duke Nov. 17 in the
Charlotte Coliseum.

Duke is picked by many prognos-
ticators to make the Final Four and win
its third national championship this de-
cade.

The Blue Devils will no doubt be a

top three team in the country when they
take the floor to face the Wildcats two
weeks from tonight.

“Tt is a wonderful opportunity for
us, and it immediately gives us national
attention,” McKillop said.

From there, the Wildcats head to
Annapolis, Md., to open the road sea-
son against Navy. The Midshipmen,
last year’s Patriot League champion,
participated in the NCAA tournament
before a first-round loss to North Caro-
lina.

The Wildcats then face Wake For-
est on the road the Saturday after
Thanksgiving.

Wake returns ACC freshman of
the year, Robert O’Kelley, who hurt
Davidson with his deadly shooting in
last year’s contest.

The transfer of seven-footer Loren
Woods to Arizona leaves the Demon
Deacons with 11 of their 12 scholarship
players as first- or second-year players.

The Wildcats have their home
opener Nov. 30 at Belk Arena against
Elon before traveling to Lincoln, Neb.,
for the Ameritas Classic on the first
weekend of December.

McKillop’s bunch will face
Colgate in the first round and, with a
win, host Nebraska in the four-team
tourney finale.

Davidson will return home Dec. 8

to face cross-town rival UNC Char-
lotte. The Wildcats have lost two straight
to the Mecklenburg rival 49ers, but
look to change that this year.

In its last action before shifting
focus to conference action, Davidson
meets UMass for the third straight year
— this season’s clash coming Dec. 29
in Amherst, Mass.

Athlon’s preseason magazine rates
the UMass frontcourt, led by monster
center Lari Ketner, as one of the four
toughest in the country.

The conference schedule begins
with a bang Jan. 2, as the Wildcats
square off with North Division arch-
enemy Appalachian State.

Boone’s Mountaineers will be
looking for revenge after dropping its
only three league games last season to
Davidson — including a conference
tourney title game loss in early March at
the Greensboro Coliseum.

Highlighting the rest of the South-
ern schedule: League newcomer Col-
lege of Charleston’s visit to Belk Jan.
30. Both the Cougars and the Wildcats
were NCAA tournamentteamslast year,
as Charleston nabbed the Trans America
Athletic Conference’s automatic bid.

Most prognosticators pick Charles-
ton to once again go to the tournament.
The Wildcats, however, should have
something to say about that.

Tue Men’s LEADERHSIP_

By Tripp CHERRY
Staff Writer

Senior captains Ben Ebong, Ali
Ton, and Chadd Holmes are poised to
lead the men’s basketball team to an-
other standout season on the hard-
wood.

All three were important leaders

last year. Now it’s official, though,
and their roles have changed a bit.
. “We have to be more vocal to
replace the leadership of (1997-98 cap-
tains) Mark (Donnelly) and Billy
(Amnstrong),” said Holmes, an impor-
tant part: of the Wildcat frontcourt,
rated by many as the best in the South-
ern Conference.

Ton, a proven leader, has been
the Wildcats’ starting point guard since
his sophomore year.

He led the conference — and
finished 14th in the nation — in as-
sists, averaging 6.4 a game. The na-
tive of Turkey is currently coming off
a broken foot but should be ready to
take the court when Davidson faces
off against Duke Nov. 17 at the Char-
lotte Coliseum.

Ebong, last year’s Southern Con-
ference tourney MVP, averaged 9.4
points and 6.2 rebounds per game. He
will be counted on again this year for
his scoring and rebounding, as well as
for his leadership on and off the court.

Ebong emphasized the impor-
tance of being more of a leader off the
court.

“Tt is now our responsibility as
captains to be organizers off the court,”
said Ebong, the league’s best sixth
man last season. “We have to make
sure all the guys know when practices
are and when meetings are. It is our
responsibility to make sure that they
are always where they are supposed to
be.”

Holmes played in all 30 games
last year, averaging 5.2 points and 3.1
rebounds per game. He should again
be akey post player off the bench after
having provided a spark in a number
of contests last season.

road win at Appalachian State in which
he scored 16 points on perfect shoot-
ing.

“Benand Aliare passionate com-
petitors with talkative personalities,
and you can see the transfer of their

Captains give guidance

His biggest game came in a key _

personality down to the rest of the
team,” coach Bob McKillop said.
“Chadd has also become much more
assertive and defiant on the court this
year.”

In addition to the three captains,
fellow senior David Burns — who is
currently nursing a back injury —
brings four years of experience to the
team.

Burns is a player that can score in
bunches. On many occasions last year,
the senior from Winston-Salem gave
the team with necessary bench scor-
ing.

In the Southern Conference final
against Appalachian, he hit three three-
pointers in a five-minute span to give
the Wildcats an important lead going
into halftime.

The Wildcats also have a strong
junior class to count on. Landry
Kosmalski, the 1996-1997 league
freshman of the year, has proven his
leadership capabilities the past two
years and should continue to help this
year’s seniors lead the Wildcats.

The experience and leadership of
Davidson’s seniors should have: the
Wildcats ready to make another excit-
ing run at an NCAA tournament berth.

“Getting to the tournament last
year was big,” Ton said. “But we’re
not-satisfied.”

assists.

Guards Ali Ton and Davor
Halbauer and forwards Landry
Kosmalski and Stephen Marshall are
back, as is Ben Ebong, the league’s top
sixth mana year ago and the conference
tournament MVP. Ebong should enter
a starting role this season.

The Wildcats also return the entire
frontcourt and will look to pound the
ball consistently inside with a balanced
offensive attack. With scoring by com-
mittee, Ebong, Kosmalski, and Marshall
all averaged over nine points a game in
1997-98.

“You'll see the ball consistently in
the paint more,” McKillop said. “We
have tremendous confidence in our in-

terior game with Landry, Ben, Stephen,

and Chadd (Holmes).”

Holmes, one of three senior cap-
tains along with Ebong and Ton, will
log significant minutes in the post. But
as with Marshall, he will not hesitate to
move outside and drain the three-
Also likely to make an impact:

Martin Ides, a 7-foot-2 freshman who

brings tremendous size to the reserve
rotation.

And with added mass to his 6-7
frame, anticipate seeing sharp-shoot-
ing David Burns possibly playing power
forward off the bench.

In addition, Emeka Erege returns
after a season-ending leg fracture. With
regained confidence and proven ath-
letic ability, Erege is healthy enough to
take the court and play his first full
season.

The backcourt will have no prob-
lems passing the basketball inside to the
big men.

Ton returns this year 86 assists shy
of the career record held by Chris Alpert,
who was a senior star when Ton was a
rookie. Despite preseason foot surgery,
the Turk appears ready for the season
opener against Duke Nov. 17 at the
Charlotte Coliseum.

“There are players vital to your
team,” McKillop said. “Ali is one for
us. Ali is a leader in every sense of the
word.”

With a semester of practice under
his belt last spring, frosh Michael Bree
will back up Ton at the point.

A deadly long-range threat,

Halbauer must drive to the basket and
supply a consistent perimeter shot to
help ward against defensive double
teams on the Wildcat post players.

Jeff Bergmann and Brian Turner,
athletic marksmen around the three-
point arc, will provide a quick first step
and energy off the bench,

With a 63-25 overall record over
the past three seasons, including a spec-

tacular 37-6 mark within conference
play, Davidson knows how to win. Such
success leads to confidence — but in
the case of these Wildcats, not overcon-
fidence.

“Teams that have success fall in
love with their success,” McKillop said,
“But our players have not fallen on love
with our success and are looking for
more.”

But one question remains.

Can the 1998-99 edition of
Davidson basketball repeat as Southern
Conference champions like its 1969
and 1970 predecessors.

Deepandexperienced, McKillop’s
corps look ready for another 20-win
campaign, another trip tocollege hoops’
biggest party, and a possible first-round
victory.
