esidence last Friday of a brain

A Reidsville native, Kemp

who knew Kemp during his stud-
ies here was History professor
Malcolm Lester. “I remember
Kemp as a very serious and hard-
working student with a very warm
and outgoing personality,” Lester
said, “His death is a very great loss
to Davidson and his community.”

Kemp went for a Harvard
Business School degree after
Davidson. He began his banking
career at NCNB in 1967, where

While there, Kemp turned
around a division suffering from
malaise, pushed for affirmative
action policies and advocated
family leave and child-care pro-
grams. He became chairman of
NCNB Texas, which was formed
from the remnants of First Repub-
licBank Corporation, in 1988. He
used his skills in strategy and or-
ganization in this position until the
illness led to his early retirement a
year ago. ;

Praised by his friends for his
warmth, energy, motivation and
intelligence, Kemp proved to be an
asset to his many.other endeavors.

tion, Kemp served as co-chairman

fund drive. “He was one of the
greatest people I’ve ever known,”

“He was a great friend to ev-

may be why he was so special,”

Col. Harry Summers, noted
author and current military analyst
| for the Cable News. Network, re-
cently exposed the live-wire issue
of peace or war in the Persian Gulf
in a talk sponsored the Dean Rusk
Program and the History depart-
ment. —

The choices that Congress and
President Bush make as United
Nations forces converge inthe Gulf
will help define the leadership in
the post-Cold War world, said
Summers. “If this happened'a year
ago, we wouldn’thave been able to
do anything about it, because Iraq
would have crept under the skirts
of the Soviet Union. Now we’reon
the edge of a new dirt and we

“This will be a precedent set
| ting incident that we’re going to
live with for a long time.” Sum-

mers asks: Will the precedent be
that aggression pays and you can
ride rough-shod over: your neigh-
bors, or will this incident prove
that the U.N. works?

A guestof the college last year,
Summers returned to a warm
Davidson welcome from a crowd
composed primarily of students,
packed in the 900 Room. His story

‘isintriguing: when he was fifteen

years old, Summers lied to a re-
cruiter in order to join the army. He
became a veteran of the Korean
and Vietnam Wars.

On Strategy, Summers’ s criti-_

cal analysis of the Vietnam War,
has become an influential guide
for military analysis and is required
reading at many military colleges.

“You need to be very clear
about what you’re trying to do;
that was one of the great failings of

better now,” he said. “In Vietnam,
the objective was never established
and neither was the value. With

asking, Is our objective worth it?”
Summers thinks that President
Bush’s actions have been in sync
with his words--the president said
thathe would send in enough forces
to defend and sustain any attack.

Students Stage
Middle East Rally

By JOE MARIS

Davidson students stepped up
to international issues November
15 during a special rally opposing
President Bush’s proposed use of
force in Kuwait. Reflecting the
growing fear in the United States
caused by what many believe to be
Bush’s use of unsound foreign
policy, the rally provided a place
for students and teachers to speak
out against war as well as achance
to ask questions concerning. the
possible alternatives of war.

Davidson seniors Bob Hornsby
and Molly Graver organized the
event held at the College Union.
Graver \circulated a petition that
was later sent to President Bush

with 150 signatures. The petition
stated that the undersigned stu-
dents, teachers and Davidson
community citizens challenged
Bush to reconsider his foreign
policy, and for him to concentrate
on diplomacy rather than aggres-
sion. The petition also reminded
Bush  that-only- Congress could
declare war and that one man
shouldn’t be responsible for a war
that could affect millions of people.
_ Studentsattending the rally had
a similar opportunity to address
the United States government with
the availability of form letters
designed to encourage their con
