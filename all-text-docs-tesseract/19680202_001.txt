Facuity Votes Changes
In Calendar, Cut Policy

One-Fourth
Cut Limit
Established

The faculty voted in its
meeting Tuesday to establish
a new limit for chapel cuts
beginning this semester.

The new plan allows stu-
dents to cut 25 per cent of
the chapel programs. The
schedule this semester calls
for 36 chapel periods and.
therefore, a limit of nine
chapel cuts.

The new system replaces
the previous limitation.
which provided for eight cuts
for freshmen and sophomores
and 12 for juniors and sen-
iors. As a result, underclass-
men will receive an extra
cut this semester and jun-
iors’ and seniors will lose
three.

The faculty made the deci
sion in keeping with the pro
posal to place all classes and
programs, including physical
education, of the college un-
der a 25 per cent cut system.

Final Exercises

Department: Rusk

Not Officially Contacted

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Managing Editor
Secretary of State Dean
Rusk, mentioned as a pos-
sible successor to President
D. Grier -Martin, has not
been approached by the col-
lege about the job, the chief
State Department press offi-

cer said this week.

Robert J. McCloskey. dep-
uty assistant secretary of
state for public affairs, also
said in a telephone interview
that Rusk had at no time
given any indication as to
when he might resign from
the State Department.

Council Selects
Advisory Group

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer
The Student Council Tuesday selected four stu-
dents to serve on a committee to consult with the trus-
tee committee during the process of choosing David-

son’s new president.

Chosen were Tom Earrhardt, Bobby Lane, Joe
Kilpatrick and Rich Cowart. They will serve in an ad-
visory capacity in conjunction with a faculty commit-

tee of six members.

The council formed the
committee in response to a
letter from Walter L. Lingle
Jr.. president of the Board
of Trustees and a member of
the trustee selection commit-
tee. authorizing them to
choose up to four students to
aid the trustee committee in
finding a successor to Dr. D.
Grier Martin, retiring presi-
dent of the college.

Faculty
To Assist
In Selection

The faculty has elected the
six-man advisory committee
to the Trustee Selection Com-
snittee for a new college
president.

The committee members
are Dr. William McGavock,
chairman, and Drs. C. E.
Ratliff. Locke White, John
Kelton, Malcolm Lester and
T. O. Pinkerton.

Dean of the Faculty Fron-
tis W. Johnston said that the
purpose of the faculty advis-
ory committee is ‘‘to sug-
gest names and talk about
the general characteristics
they ought to look for’ in a
new college president.”

To what degree these men
will contribute to the selec-
tion has not yet been speci-
fied. Johnston said.

In addition to Lingle. other
members of the trustee selec-
tion committee, which will
make all final decisions, are
William F. Mulliss of Char-
lotte, secretary; Dr. Warner
Hall of Charlotte: and
Charles F. Myers Jr. of
Greensboro.

Because over 50 students
applied to serve on the com-
mittee. the council first ap-
pointed a nominating com-
mittee of seven students,
both on and off the council.
who interviewed the students
and selected 15 from whom
the final four were chosen by
the council.

Earnhardt and ‘ne are
seniors. Earnhardt has
served as president of the
student body this year, and
Lane was a student member
of the Blue Sky Committee.
which devised major curri-
culum changes for next year.

Kilpatrick is president of
the sophomore class and has
worked with the Student Ex-
change Committee this year.
Cowart is a McConnell Schol-
ar and a member of the
Freshman Council.

The council tried to select
“the four best qualified peo.
ple,” according to Earnhardt,
without paying attention to
the number from each class.

The first action of the stu-
dent committee was to send
a letter to Lingle asking him
to clarify the exact role stu-
dents will play in the selec-
tion.

Rusk, a 1931 Davidson
graduate, is apparently one
of several men on a growing
list of candidates to succeed
Martin, who resigned last
month.

Despite McCloskey’s denial
of any approach to Rusk by
college representatives, it
has been reported in local
newspapers that Rusk is be-
ing considered for the presi-
dency.

Some of the other men that
have been suggested include:

Samuel Reid Spencer Jr.,
‘40, president of Mary Bald
win College and former as-
sistant to the president and
dean of students here: Carle.
ton Burke Chapman, ‘36, a
Rhodes Scholar and dean of
the Dartmouth Medical
School; Frontis W. Johnston,
‘30, dean of the faculty of
Davidson.

Also, Walter L. Lingle, ‘28.
president of the Board of
Trustees and vice-president
of Proctor and Gamble; Rob
ert Currie, ‘47, college treas-
urer and business manager:
and former N. C. Gov. Terry
Sanford.

Rusk:s only previous ex-
perience in the field of edu-
cation was in 1934-40, when
he was associate professor of
government and dean of the
faculty at Mills College. a
woman's college in Oakland.
Calif.

He has held the top post in
the State Department since
1960. Prior to that he held

Grading

System
Altered

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

The faculty voted Tuesday
to accept a series of sweeping
changes in
calendar, cut and grading
systems, chapel programs
and interdisciplinary courses.

The decisions reached cli-
maxed months of study in co
ordination with next year's
implementation of the Blue
Sky ‘curriculum.

After consideration of sev-
eral proposed calendars to
fit the three-term Blue Sky
program, the faculty approv
ed a calendar of three equal
10-week periods. ,

Under the calendar, classes
will begin in late September.
Examinations for the fall
term will be completed prior
to the Christmas vacation.

The winter term will com
mence on Jan. 2, and will be
completed in late March. Dr.
Joseph Drake, professor of
sociology and chairman of
the faculty Academic Sched
uling Committee. said the
faculty realized that the Jan.
2 starting date was the same
date that raised student pro-
tests earlier this year and
was ultimately changed.

After a five-day spring va-
cation, the spring term will
begin late in March and will
be terminated during the first
week of June. Commence.
ment will end the school year
on June 7 and 8.

Several faculty members
said that the vote far accep-
tance of the new calendar
was quite close, but declined
to comment on the reasons
for disagreement.

In another move Tuesday
the faculty voted to replace
the current grading system
with one involving wider
grade ranges and a four point
scale.

Under the new system. a
grade of *‘A” will require an
average of 90-100: a grade
of “B", 80.89: “C', 70-79:
“D", 60-69: and an °F" will
be given for any average be
low 60.

It. was also recommended
and accepted that three types
of reports be made available
on each student's perform.

Elections Ahead For Union,
Social Council, ‘Miscellany’

By BILL WARREN
Staff Writer

Elections will be held next
week to vote on the editor of
president

“The Miscellany,”

As Otts Lecturer

Dr. John B. Cobb Jr., this
year’s Otts Lecturer, will
make a three-day visit to
Davidson Feb. 14-16.

Cobb, who has been teach.
ing since 1950. is currently
Ingraham professor of theol-
ogy at the School of Theol-
ogy. Claremont, Calif.

The theologian has sched-
uled two public lectures and
a chapel speech while he is
on campus. He has selected
the topic “The God Who Has
Died and the God Who
Lives” as the general theme
for his lectures.

Cobb is the author of sev-
eral books, including ‘‘Theol-
ogy as History,” “The Struc-
ture of Christian Experi.
ence,” “Living Options in
Protestant Theology” and “A
Christian Natural Theology.”
The last: work is an interpre-
tation of the thought of Al-
fred North Whitehead.

An ordained Methodist
minister, Cobb studied at
Emory University, the Uni-
versity of Michigan, the Uni-
versity of Chicago and the
Divinity School of the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

of the Union Board and chair-
man of the Social Council.
with another election to be
held in the near future to
vote on several amend-
ments to the constitution.

Candidates for the editor of
“The Miscellany’’ are George
House from  Robersonville
and Fred Lowrance of Ashe-
ville.

The Publications Board will
meet Monday. according to
Sam Boyte. its president. to
approve two more candi-
dates. Al Jasper of Oreland.
Pa.. and Bill Smythe = of
Greensboro.

Ed Embree. now vice-presi-
dent of the Union Board, is
unopposed for the presidency
of the board. while Charles
Cameron, social chairman uf
the Union Board, is unoppos-
ed for chairman of the So-
cial Council.

Tom Earnhardt, president
of the Student Council, has
told Embree that the two

candidates will probably be
allowed to run unopposed in
next week's elections.

When Tom Baker ran un-
opposed for the editor of
“The Wildcat Handbook"’ ear-
lier this year, the Student
Council put off the election
because of insufficient noti-
fication to all students of the
available candidacy.

Elections are tentatively
set for sometime next week.
Because of a new by-law.
polls will be open from 7:50
a.m, to 2:40 p.m.. with four
voting tables set up, one for
each class.

Also, in the near future an
election will be held to vote
on three amendments to the
constitution, all dealing with
the student body regulations
in Article IX.

These amendments will be
presented and explained at
the next chapel, and elections
will be held between five and
10 days afterwards.

Bids will be available to
rushees at 10 a.m. tomorrow
at Hodson Hall; freshmen
accepting bids must return
them by 2 p.m. tomorrow.

The organization of the va-
rious rush parties at ineivid
ual fraternities varied. At
Phi Gamma Delta, rushees
were met by three girls in
colorful muumuus, who gave
out imitation leis and kissed
each boy.

However, one freshman
rushee said, ‘‘That was. the
most sexless kiss I ever got.”

Cochran and Ben Cannon,
who is chairman of the IFC's
rush committee, spoke to the
rushees at a special chapel
Monday morning. Cochran

advised the 276 rushees to be-

themselves. to be relaxed
and courteous, to try to pre-
sent themselves and to use a
firm handshake.

At Sigma Chi, rushees were
shown a short slide presenta.
tion, not without its humor,
on the fraternity’s social life.

Cochran said Wednesday
that there had been no ‘dir-
ty rush'’ violations during
the week.

“These revisions have been
made,”’ he continued, ‘in or
der. to clarify and tighten up
the wording of the first
draft."

Copies of the Constitution
will be distributed to all stu
dents Monday, and a volun
tary meeting of the student
body has been called for
Monday afternoon to fulfill
the requirement for reading
the proposal to the students.

In addition. an open forum
is scheduled for Thursday.
and members of the Consti-
tution Revision Committee
will be available to meet with
any group that wishes to dis-
cuss the constitution. Fresh-
man hall meetings are also
being scheduled for next
week.

In addition to the revisions
in phrasing, the new draft
also contains additions to the
old document. It requires
that the president of the
Student Government Asso-
ciation (SGA) be a_ senior
and that the vice président
be a junior.

Within the Bill of Rights is
a new guarantee that a stu-
dent's activities outside the
classroom will have no ef
fect on any evaluation he
may receive for academic
work. A joint student-facul-
ty committee will be created
to protect students from un-
fair academic evaluation.

A new freedom of privacy
clause guarantees students
the right to keep their aca
demic, personal and political
records in confidence, barred
to ‘specified inquirers.”’

The area dealing with due
process has heen extensively
rewritten and strengthened.
Within this area, the rights
of the student accused of vio
lating the Honor Code are
listed methodically to reduce
confusion.
