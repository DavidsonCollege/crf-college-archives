Master's Thesis Turns Into Blockbuster

By Amy Reynolds (CPS)

When Amanda Silver started
thinking about ideas for her mas-
ter’sthesis, she had no ideait would
turn into a movie, let alone a suc-
cessful one.

Silver, who wrote the screen-
play to Hollywood Pictures’ “The
Hand That Rocks The Cradle,”
graduated with her master’s in

: screenwriting from the University
of Southern California film school
in 1989.

The school requires screen-

writing students to write a scriptas

theit thesis. ; ._. :

“T wanted to write a thriller,”
Silversays. Playing withthe theme
of Shakespeare’s Othello, a play
Silver says she “thought would
make a great thriller,” she decided
to focus her thesis “on how one’s
own doubt could be (his or her)
worst enemy.”

“My husband suggested using
two women. ..and thenanny came

about as a device to get proxim- ©

ity,” Silver says, “to get someone
close enough to. prey on someone
else’s self-doubt.”

“That is the premise to the film,

which features Rebecca DeMor-
nay as the nanny, Peyton Flanders.
After the death of her husband and
miscarriage of her baby, Flanders
tries to starta“‘new” life - a life that
already belongs to Claire Bartel,
played by Annabella Sciorra, a
working woman and devoted
mother and wife.

Silver says the project took her
two semesters to complete - one to
develop the idea and one to write
it. The transformation from thesis
to movie came about “because I

got very lucky,” Silver says.

Her husband, Rick Jaffa, pro-
duced the film and helped her with
the rewriting process, Silver says.
Jaffa, and Silver’s own connec-
tions as a past executive assistant
at Tri-Star Pictures and at Para-
mount Pictures helped her land a
deal to turn the thesis into a film.

“My (success) story is espe-
cially exciting to people struggling
in film school,” Silver says, be-
cause it shows that people can
succeed in “the struggle to become
an artist.”
