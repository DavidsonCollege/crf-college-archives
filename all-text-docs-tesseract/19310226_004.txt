Chattanooga,

Great Alumni Meeting
Held in Chattanooga
Last Wednesday Night

Over One Hundred Former Students
Attend Dinner From Thirteen
States and Two Foreign
Countries

THIRTY-FOUR CLASSES

Dr. W. M. Anderson, of Dallas,
Texas, Thrilled Hearers With
Outside Viewpoint of
Davidson
Over one hundred Davidson College al-
umni, representing 34 different classes, 13
states and two foreign countries, gathered in
the banquet hall of the First Presbyterian
Church at Chattanooga, Tenn., on Wednes-
day, February 18, for what is believed to
have been one of the greatest alumni meet-
ings ever staged, These men were attend-
ing the World Congress on Missions, and
were invited to this meeting to listen to
Davidson students, other, alumni and’ friends
of the college.
Elsewhere on this page, a list of those
who filled out cards is given: Carl R. Pritch-
ett, 30, Y. M. C. A. secretary at Davidson
and toastmaster of the occasion, has also
recounted some observations, and has report-
ed in detail the remarks of Dr. W. M. An-
derson, of Dallas, Texas, who was invited
to give an outsider’s opinion of Davidson.
Every student who attended the dinner has
been talking about the glow ing remarks of
this popular minister.
Wood, of the Senior class,
opened the series of talks by discussing Da-
vidson’s “Perpetual Heritage.” The spirit of
the student body, the work of the Y. M.
C. A., the athletic prestige, and the tradi-
tions which had been handed down were
mentioned, and he also cited some of the
newer traditional institutions that had had
their inception during the past few years.
Charles Norfleet, Sophomore president,
$poke on the subject, “What Davidson Stu-
dents Expect of Davidson Alumni,” He con-
tended that Davidson students expect the al-
umni to send the right kind of student to
Davidson to uphold the standards and ideals
already on the campus, and said that the
students always wanted a continued interest
from the alumni in the affairs of the student
body.

Ferguson

The third student who spoke was J. A.
Jones, of the Senior class. His topic was
“Davidsonian Contacts.” These were obtained
through the attendance of alumni at athletic
contests, through the records of Davidson
students in graduate schools, through the
alumni office, and through the alumni them-
selves in their daily associations in all parts
of the world.

The remarks of Dr, Ben R. Lacy, ’06, and
Dr. Anderson immediately followed, and the
meeting adjourned in time for the night ses-

Observations

Alumni Personals

By Carl R. Pritchett
“Y” Secretary and Toast-
Master

Dr. Bill Anderson of Dallas, Texas, in
a few choice words gave an “Outsider’s
Viewpoint of Davidson” to close the re-
remarks of the evening. He conducted the
spring: services on the campus last spring
and so had an excellent opportunity to
come into contact with the spirit of the
student body. He thrilled those present by
the glowing tribute which h% paid to the
spirit of our school. He said there were
three things which stood out in his mind
as elements upon which our spirit was
based. The real manhood of the student
body which had the stamp of character,
2. The unafraid and unashamed Christian
spirit which pervaded the campus life. 3.
The fact that the leaders in the student
body actively stood out first of all as
Christian gentlemen in the truest sense
of the word and exerted very energy that
the spirit of Christ might dominate the
campus life. After his words the David-
son amen present were proud indeed to
be a part of the spirit of Davidson.

Dr. Ben Lacy spoke for a few minutes
ou “What Davidson alumni expect of Da-
vidson Students” and his stirring words
constituted a real challenge to Davidson
men. He spoke of the crying need for un-
afraid Christian men and particularly was
this true in the wogk of the Church, He
appealed to Davidson men to respond to
this need for he stated, “If this leadership
dloes not come from schools such as ours,
from whence will it come?”

‘Presbyterian College held their alumni
banquet in a hall adjoining the one in
Which the held forth and
the yells and songs reminded one of the
days gridiron rivalry. Though the
heads of some were powdered with grey
and others mirrors of reflected light they
yelled none the less heartily. In keeping
with the spirit of both schools both com-
plimented the other with a yell.

SHIRTS AND SHORTS

Some men say amusing things about color in shirts and shorts
—but no one questions the unusual comfort in this two-piece
underwear as made by HANES. We’ve taken track-athlete free-
dom and enlarged on it a bit for men who’ve dropped their
calisthenics, but who love comfort none the less. We are a little
tickled, too, that we can match the weird colors in your ties, your
shirts, and your socks—though there is pure white, of course.
