fabled them to defeat Wake Forest the fol-

lowing evening. Outclassing
team in all departments, the Wildcats were
able to roll up a 49 to 18 score, although
Coach Younger used substitutions frequently.
From the very first it was Davidson's game,
though it was not until the final period that
the Wildeats did their score-rolling.
Davidson opened the first half with a burst
ot speed and Anderson scored on the third
pass from center. Then they ran the score
to 6-0 before the Quakers scored. Staley
was able to hit the basket with some degree
of accuracy while others were off

Davidson 48, Wake Forest 28

The Wildcats rang down the curtain on
the North Carolina basketball season Satur-
day night with a smashing 48-28 victory over
the Demon Deacons from Wake Forest. It
was without doubt the best game of the sea-
son, as Coach Younger’s men showed their
finest burst of speed and accuracy at goal
shooting. Staley, Laird and Anderson led
the Davidson goal shooting, but Boggs and
McConnell were equally good in floor work
and dribbling, Boggs sending two neat shots
and McConnell one.

Although the victory was one of team
work and passing it was Laird’s great game
as he scored 18 points, playing as well on
defense as offense. At times Staley and An-
derson’s work under the baskets, following a
fast passing attack, was great.

Garrity’s men threw something of a scare
into the ranks of the Davidson students lin-
ing the balcony as they hopped off to an
early lead. But soon Davidson reached her
form and before the middle of the first half
the scoring trio shot Davidson ahead to
22-11.

Early in the second half Davidson went
ahead to 30-13 and following Wake For-
est’s great spurt which reached its climax at
Davidson 32, Baptists 24, the Wildcats were
never again in danger. 3

Greason showed his great speed, playing a
10-point game while Emerson's passing was
good. The line-up and summary follow:
Davidson (48) Position. W. Forest (28)
Staley (13) -. -- -- -- --_-- Ellington (6)
