Davidson’s football team domi-
nated in the second half against
Campbell last Saturday to claim a
well-earned 24-7 victory in their
conference opener.

Kenny Mantuo ’11 led the way
for the Wildcats, carrying the ball
20 times for 135 yards and a touch-
down. The offense was also paced
by the efficient quarterback play of
Michael Blanchard ’11, who passed
for 83 yards on 9-17 passing and
two touchdowns while also rushing
for 91 yards. The Wildcats rushed
for 268 yards as a team. Andrew
Aldrich *10 led the receiving corps
with four receptions for 41 yards
and the game’s first touchdown.

The game was a tale of two
halves, as the first half of action
was scoreless. The Camels man-
aged 91 first-half yards, and the
Wildcats produced 103. Davidson
seemed to be in position to drive for
a score early in the second quarter

Last week the men’s cross
country team opened their season
by destroying the field in route
to winning the Eye Opener. How
would they back up that perfor-
mance? They continued their hot
start to the 2009 season by taking
the top spot in the Winthrop Asics
Fall Classic this past Saturday.

The Wildcats held off Elon
University, which finished only two
points behind the ’Cats. Davidson
finished with 43 points, and round-
ing out the rest of the top-five team
finishers were: Elon (45 points),
Western Carolina (64 points), Win-
throp (92 points), and Wofford (132
points).

Individually, the Wildcats per-
formed exceptionally well. Lance
Harden ’10 finished second overall
with a time of 24:59. Right behind
Harden was Ryan Hopkins ’12 with
a time of 25:14. Finishing second
and third overall meant one and
two points, respectively, since the
top finisher, Matthew Elliott, who
finished in 24:56, was unaffiliated.
Rounding out the top-five individu-
als was a tandem from Western

colina, Tosey Weaver (25:35)
and Stephen Hammond (25:44).

Other Davidson finishers were
Demetrios Paginos’ 13(13th/26:27),
Peter Bruton ’10 (18th/26:37), Greg
Marcil *11 (23rd/26:51), Vincent
Weir 713 (27th/27:06), Wes Reyn-
olds °13 (30th/27:19), Ian Tupper
712 (40th/27:56), Will Mitchell
13 (49th/28:20), Daniel Bush *13
(58th/28:59) and Ehsan Akbari ’13
(69th/29:35).

The Wildcats will look for
their third consecutive victory in
the 2009 season when they travel
to Louisville, KY for the Greater
Louisville Cross Country Classic
on October 3.

The women’s cross country
team put together another impres-
sive performance on Saturday at
the Winthrop Asics Fall Classic.
Just as the men did, the women re-
peated their performance from their
opening meet at the Eye Opener.
For the second consecutive meet,
the women finished runner-up, this
time finishing only behind South
Carolina.

In what turned out to be a three-
team battle for the top spot, the
Wildcats held off Elon for second
place, but were unable to track

down the Gamecocks, finishing
seven points behind. The top-five
team finishers were South Carolina
(46 points), Davidson (53 points),
Elon (56 points), Western Carolina
(100 points), and Winthrop (103
points).

Individually, the Wildcats were
strong. Natalie Atabek 13 paced
the Wildcats, running the 5k in
18:43, which gave her a fifth place
finish. Lauren Childs ’11 continued
her strong start to the 2009 season
with an eighth place finish, running
the Winthrop University track in
18:56.

Other Davidson finishers were
Jane Gay ’12 (10th/19:00), Heather
Connaroe °11 (16th/19:09), Dan-
ielle Ruggieri “11 (19th/19:20),
Sarah Cline ’12 (25th/19:37), Anna
Stockamore ’ 12 (40th/20:10), Caro-
line Gecker ’13 (45th/20:29), Haley
Holway 713 (52nd/20:40), Anna-
marie Armistead °13 (66th/21:53),
Hope Cain *12 (76th/22:46) and
Alyssa Moudy ’13 (84th/23:44).

The Wildcats hope to break
through for their first win when
they also travel to Louisville, KY
for the Greater Louisville Cross
Country Classic on October 3.

Davidson men’s soccer had a
busy week, traveling to both Rad-
ford University on Wednesday and
Presbyterian University on Satur-
day night. With superior defense
and two stellar offensive outings,
Davidson captured two more wins
to improve their record to 4-1, win-
ning their second consecutive road
outing.

Wasting no time at all on
Wednesday, Davidson came out
on fire. Charlie Reiter ’10 scored
quickly when Machel Turner’s ’10
initial attack was deflected by a
Radford defender. Reiter collected
the ball at the top of the penalty box
and fired it in to put Davidson up
1-0 just 21 seconds into the match.
The duo of Turner and Reiter were
far from finished though. At the
55:54 mark, Reiter slid a pass into
Turner who converted putting the
ball inside the left post and giving
Davidson the 2-0 lead.

Davidson would go on to win
by ascore of 2-0. Chip Sanders ’12
registered his second shutout of the
season with two saves in goal. The
Davidson defense did a great job
holding Radford to only nine shots
all night. Reiter leads Davidson

with three goals and one assist on
the season, accumulating a total of
seven points.

On Saturday, Presbyterian got
out to an early lead. In the Ith
minute, Presbyterian’s Davis Or-
ders headed in a free kick cross to

’Cats impress with road wins

put the Blue Hose up 1-0. Pres-
byterian did not hold the momen-
tum or enjoy the lead for too long
though because Davidson struck
back two minutes later. Hunter
Hayes ’12 sent a long pass down-
field to Mark Millard ’12 who fired
in a 15 yard shot to respond to Pres-
byterian’s early score and knot the
game at 1-1. Davidson’s offensive
presence was felt greatly in the first
half as Davidson out shot Presbyte-
rian 10-4.

In the second half, the story was
a bit different as the Blue Hose out
shot Davidson 10-7. Fortunately,
this figure did not matter much.
Towards the end of regulation, it
looked like overtime was imminent
with the score still tied at 1-1. With
1:27 remaining in the match, Allen
Page ’12 volleyed in a corer kick
from Reiter putting Davidson up
2-1 and capturing the victory in an
exciting fashion.

Davidson improved to 5-1 on
the season Tuesday night as they
defeated High Point University 3-2
behind Yannick Pilgrim’s ’11 two
goals.

The attitude of the team is at an
all time high as they enter confer-
ence play in less than two weeks.

“Despite our slight setback
against Coastal Carolina, the mo-
mentum has been building,” said
Page. “We are hoping to carry the
momentum home for our match

against South Carolina”.
The °Cats take on the Game-
cocks at 7 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 25.
