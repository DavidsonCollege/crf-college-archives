“I personally believe that we can do a better job
with a smaller group and do it well,” replied Acting-
President Pietenpol in response to a reporter’s question

about increased enrollment.

The DAVIDSONIAN staff held;
its regularly scneduled news
conference with the College's

Wednesday in the Union.

Dean Pietenpol went on to
add that the endowment pres-

'ently stands at $8.000 per stu-

‘dent, as compared with the $30.-

000 per student that some

Northern liberal arts colleges -

,have. He pointed out that an

|

increase in enrollment would’
mean of course a decrease in
the endownient per student.

COLLEGE TOO LARGE

“Mr. Martin and 1 (referring
to D. Grier Martin, college
treasurer) both think. that Da-
vidson College is too large now:”
But. he added, the increase will
come. There are now 47,000
students in North Carolina now.
by 1967 there will be 89,000.
Therefore Davidson will prob-,
ably have to allow for an in-,
crease.

He emphasized the fact that
there is a diversity of opinion
on this subject among the facul-
ty as well as among the Trus-
tees.

Again using the comparison
with the New England liberal
arts colleges he said that ‘“Da- !
vidson can do a job parallel
to that which is being done by
northern schools that have .de-
librately remained small.”

SMALL CLASSES
Dean Pietenpol reminded the!

ther its goals.

He first became interested in
the college during the great en-
dowment drive after World War
Il. He has implemented and
deepened his concern since. To-

ual instruction could be given.
“When a class gets above 20

‘students it may as well have

200 students.”
Turning to other phases of

College activity the Dean com- +
mended highly. the past meet-} cal fraternity, initiated 24 new

He made answer to the fol-
Towing questions from the DA-
VIDSONIAN:

Do you have any new and

concrete information on whom:

the new president will be?
‘Nothing specific. I ean tell you

that the list has been eonsidera-,

‘bly narrowed. We are deter-
mined to obtain the most out-.
standing man available.

Do you have any personal
feeling on the Trustee’s in:
creased enrollment policy? No
I believe we should give serious
consideration to our responsi-
bility as an institution in this
period of crisis in Ameriean
education.

How do you feel about the
Athletic situation? Questions
will be asked about it.

As a trustee, how do you rank
our problems?

1. faculty salaries

2. the need for a president

3. long-term policy and. de-
velopment

Do you have anything per-
sonal you would like to say? I
am convinced that for its in-

is no other institution that can
match our college. I think we're
just lucky, that’s all.

Keithly Pays Visit
To ROTC Dept.

Col. Thomas G. Keithly, chief
of the North Carolina Military
District, paid a visit today to
the Davidson College ROTC De-
partment for the purpose of an
informal inspection.

During the inspection, which
was required by the commander
of the Third Army, Col. Keithly
looked over the classroom ac-
tivities, the department's fa-
cilities, and discussed with the
college officials pertinent prob-
lems and administrative proce-
dures.

In addition to the above, the
Colone! held a conference with
the Professor of Military Science
and Tactics, Lt. Col. William
Adams, and a briefing session
with the cadet staff, during
which the. cadet officers ex-
plained to Col. Keithly the func-
tions of the staff. .

This marked the second visit
of Col. Keithly to the Davidson
ROTC Department since he as-
sumed the duties of his present
position, on August 13, 1956.

Accompanying him on the in-
spection were several members
of his staff.

Meet With Board

At the ROTC Board of Review
held October 17-18 the forty-
five members of MS IV made
their choices for the branch of
the services that they want to
enter upon graduation from Da-
vidson. They also listed their
choices on the length of active
service and the date when they
will enter the services.

This year the most popular
first choice of the cadets was
Military Intelligence, with 29%
choosing this. Far behind in
second place was Artillery, with
16%. Armored was third with
13%. The remaining choices
were spread out evenly over
the other branches.

Last year the actual assign-
ments bore a strong resemblance
to this pattern. but the choices
were spread out more evenly.
Military Intelligence led with
19%, Artillery was second with
17%, and Armored was third
with 15%.

Twenty-four cadets chose to
serve only six months of active.
service, while twenty-one want
to enlist for two years. -

vespers.

The position of Mr. Thornton H. Brooks:

We are not here to discuss the admitted merits
nor the evident faults of trade unionism, but are here
to examine the union shop.

The Union Shop is wrong, because it is against
American tradition, unnecessary to union security, and
it is morally reprehensible in its compulsory aspects.

The arguments of labor that the Union Shop is
necessary to eliminate the free rider, necessary for its
development, and popular are assailable.

AGAINST CONSTITUTION

The question is as old as America, and it is near-
ly as complex. But it is against the spirit of the Con-
stitution with its emphasis upon the freedom of the
individual.

The Railway Brotherhoods held 97% of the work-
ers in that industry when there were in effect right-
to-work laws prohibiting compulsory membership.
Unions will continue to survive and thrive so long as
they suitably answer the needs of the worker.

YELLOW-DOG CONTRACT

The pendulum has swung from the old days of
the Yellow-Dog Contract when the unions fought com-
pulsory membership to the Union Shop with the very
same unions for compulsory membership. This sort
of compulsion is morally wrong.

The free rider has his individual right to resist
the obligations imposed upon him by compulsory union
membership. No one can be forced to give the United
Appeal (or to join the YMCA).

UNIONS STRONGER

Unions are stronger in North Carolina today than
they were before the right-to-work law was enacted.

The right-to-work laws, according to the Institute
of Public Opinion, is favored by a majority of the
American people, including 33% of the union rank-
and-file.

Labor-Management Debate .. .

The Position of Mr. Carey E. Haigler:

The Union Shop is neeessary to the American
Trade Union. Its popularity with the worker is indi-
cated by the since repealed provision in the Taft- ;
Hartley law which called for referendums in plants
negotiating for union shop contracts. Ninety per cent
of the workers polled favored this provision.

The Union must by law represent all the workers
in a plant where it has collective bargaining powers.
The free-rider hurts the union’s position. Moreover
his dues and membership add strength which is neces-
sary. The dues-dodger is comparable to the draft-
dodger.

NEED PARTICIPATION

All workers must accept the responsibility to par-
ticipate in Union affairs, and the union must be able to
discipline all workers in a plant.

Not all employers oppose the Union shop. Man:
agement has agreed to its inclusion in every instance
where there is union shop. Only those who believe in
the ultimate failure of unions oppose it.

RIGHT-TO-WORK LAW

The right-to-work laws are directly related to low
wages. The South is the heartland of tie right-to-work
legislation (enacted by a total of 18 states), and it is
the lowest wage-earning region of the nation.

_ North Carolina is at the bottom of the heap (47th),
and it is poorly organized for labor. Alabama receives
the highest hourly wage rates in the South, and it is
the most heavily unionized.

(Mr. Brooks suggested that this is due more to
the type of industry than anything else. Alabama has
the most heavy industry of the South, and North Caro-
lina’s manufactures are typically light: cigarettes and
furniture.).
