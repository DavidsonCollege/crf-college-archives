Charlotte. The Blue Devlis will be on their |
way down to the Southern Conference tour- |
nament in Atlanta, which means they should |
be in the peak of condition. It has been two |
years since Davidson has defeated Duke in
a basketball game and the Wildcats will be
out to win that night. |

Both Duke and Davidson were off in their |
last encounter, making the game a slow |
and uninteresting spectacle, but by then tie)
two quints should have returned to proper
form. It has always been an assured scrap |
when Davidson and Duke battle and it will |
be more so Tuesday, as the Wildcats fa
to even the count with the Blue Devils. Last |
year these two traditional rivals battled be- |
fore a crowded house in Charlotte on even |
terms, only to have the Blue Devils forge |
ahead in the last minute and win by three |
points.

Davidson journeyed to Durham earlier in |
the season and were turned back by Duke in
a slow game, 27-18. This was Davidson's
first Big Five defeat, and with it went the
Big Five lead. This was a blow to Davidson
hopes and a blow that needs revenge, as are
many other setbacks received at the hands
of Duke in the past year.

The Blue Devils and Carolina play Sat- |
urday in Chapel Hill in a return engage- |
ment. If Duke wins this game and Davidson
crashes through with two wins tonight and
tomorrow, then Davidson and Duke will |
meet Tuesday for the Big Five champion-
ship, in all .probability, though Davidson |
has a game with Wake Forest here toward |
the end of the season.

State knocked Duke off of the Big Five |
lead Jast week. when they outplayed them
to take a 26-23 decision: Croson, lanky Blue |
Devil center, was off‘his game as were Shaw
and the others.

|

The Athletic Association, according to re-
ports, is going to admit students to this |
game free of charge as they did for the
Carolina game. An effort was made to bring
the game to Davidson.

the Big Five leaders to the tune of 27-18,
in one of the major upsets of the present
basketball season. Feeling keenly the loss
of Captain. Goodson, star Wildcat guard,
the Davidson five played a hurried, wild-

| passing game and muffed numerous chances
| for easy points with poor shooting.

The Red and Black team started off in
creditable fashion, and after six minutes of
play were leading 10 to 5. However, from
this point the Wildcats trod the downward
path ,and were barely ahead at the half,
12-11. ;

During the first half of the second period
the score was knotted three times, 12-all,
15-all, and: 18-all. With four minutes left
to play, the calm Guilford five profited from
the erratic shooting and passing of the des-
perate Davidson quint to run up a com-
fortable lead.
