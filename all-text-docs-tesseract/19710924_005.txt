Plagiarism: Angels Have Dirty Faces

AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Plagiarism is a pretty stupid
thing ata college with such aca-
demic prestige as Davidson. But
‘his doesn’t keep students from
duing it because nine out of ten
times the offense is unintention-
al.

“It's an entirely different
thing when a guy does some-
thing deliberately,” said Duff
Bruce, chairman of the Honor
Court. “But when his infraction
comes from a misunderstand.
ing, it is tragic and senseless.”

Tragic and senseless mistakes
caught up with three Davidson
students in the past two years,
including one student twice. Al-
though plagiarism is usually
committed by freshmen or
sophomores, the honor court has
tried juniors and seniors for the
offense in past years.

Viewing its relationship to the
Honor Court, Bruce commented,
“Plagiarism has been the most
ticklish case to handle. We have

has only come about in the last
fifteen years.

The students registering as
Democrats suggest that this par-

ty provides a more accommo- °

dating ideology to youth than
the Republican party of their
parents. si

The basis for the poll was to
analyze student reaction to the
26th Amendment to the U. S.
Constitution, which gave com-
plete voting rights to young peo-
ple of the ages 18-21.

A national magazine has esti-
mated that 25 million new voters
will be eligible to vote in 1972.
Early nationwide — registration
surveys would indicate that the
Democrats might benefit by as
much as a 3:1 margin from the
newly enfranchised.

The effect that 25 million po-
tential votes could have in an
election is all the more startl-
ing when one considers that
Nixon only received 31.8 mil-
lion votes in 1968. -

One of the problems that per-
plexed those answering the poll
was the fact that registration
practices around the country
Vary greatly.

One Mississippi student com-
nented on the changes in voter
registration which took place
“ith the federal Voting Rights
Act in the sixties.

“There was a time when no-
body in my state could register
without some difficulty. This
was bad. Well, the federal gov-
ernment had a good idea but
they messed it up badly in prac-
tice. Now any fool can register.

“When I went in to register
they asked me for no identifi-
cation whatsoever, and I could
see that they were going out of
their way to bring in other peo-
ble by the carloads to sign their
name without checking.

“Now in Mississippi the vot-
IN€ process is so watered down
‘hat there really is nothing to
vote for. I can vote in both
Primaries if I want to.”

One Florida student express-
ed his dilemma with out-of-state

to deal with people «who have
no concept of what their crime
is. Most of them think that the
language as well as the thought
that they
own,”

Each year the Wildcat Hand-
book includes the Honor Code
for the perusal of every fresh
man, along with a clarification
of plagiarism, calling it “‘liter-
ary dishonesty.”

The dictionary defines plag-
iarism as “copying or imitating
the language, idea s, and
thoughts of another and Passing
off the same as one’s original
work.”

The handbook continues, “‘If,
in a theme, you COPY the lan
Guage of someone else (source
books, another theme, etc.) you
must) put all such language
Within quotation marks, and in-
dicate

The handbook adds that the

registration. ‘In Florida, the
federal government says that |
can register as a college stu-
dent in another state and vote
there. Here in North Carolina
a state law says that | can’t
vote here because |'’m_ from
Florida. And nobody wants to
put up with the hassle of voting
on an absentee ballot.”

In some states up north, re-
gistering for people under 21
has become difficult) in some
sections where the populatign
resents the 26th Amendment.

One New Jersey student. re-
marked, “In my home town |
can register without identifica-
tion, but in other places guys
have to drive 50 miles to an-
other town to register because
of the feeling against young
people who want to register.”

The 26th Amendment may be
law in ‘fact, but’ registration
for some youths is as tricky as
voting in Cooke County.

Although Davidson students
are registered roughly in the
same patterns predicted by ex-
peris when the voting age was
lowered, there are some back-
ground differences between this
college and the national aver-
age which might give a more
honest perspective to the poll.

More than half of the stu-
dents who responded to the poll
are registered to vote, but only
one-fourth of the student body
even bothered to answer the
poll, and a minority of these
answered parts of its incorrect-
ly.

Therefore, the group which
answered the poll does not re-
present a valid sampling of the
student body because it more
than likely includes those who
are the least apathetic at Dav-
idson.

The 250 students who filled
out the poll probably show a
greater interest in politics and
student activism than the other
800 who ignored the poll.-
The Davidson student is a spe-
cial crossection of people also.
The majority of the student

though no quotation marks.

But apparently the handbook
is not popular reading. Most
continue to ignore any warnings
that they might hear in a spe-
cia! hall meeting when an hon-
or court member drops_ by.
They remain in ignorance until
they find themselves before a
jury Stammering — helplessly
While their college education
flies out the window.

Bruce mentioned that crea-
live writing for literary awards
or classes also comes under the
definition of plagiarism. There
nas been one such case in the
past.

“Plagiarism on any kind of
Paper is a serious thing.”’ Bruce
stated. “‘Nitpicking, you could
‘ind a technical violation of
vlagiarism in any research pa-
per, but we have enough trou-
Dle with blatant quotations of
long passages,

“Freshmen come here from
a public school system and know
nothing about an honor code.
It's hard to expect them to

most are the sons of upper class
parents.

Davidson students are sup-
posed to be. better equipped
mentally than the average stu-
dent, and maybe this accounts
for the variety of witty remarks
added to a number of the polls.

But what really bothers us
most is, if Davidson students
are really that smart, how
come 29 of the polls came back
with “yes” marked for the
question, “How are your par-
ents registered?”

know what's going on. When the
work load is dumped on them,
they get pressed for time on
papers, and then you never can
tell what they will do.”

3ruce added, ‘‘We’re not out
to get anybody. We simply want
to get.the facts about plagiar-
ism out so that nobody gets
into trouble because of ignor-
ance.”

Most cases of plagiarism
would not be exposed if the
student himself did not tip off
the professor by listing the
source in the bibliography or
in a footnate.

Unless the professor is fam-
iliar with a_ particular book
from which a student draws his
infoimation or unless the style
is blatantly unlike that of the
student, there is little evidence
to implicate the offender.

Bruce feéls that the  profes-
sor can play a major role in
preventing plagiarism in his
classes. ‘‘First, if a student is
unsure as to what plagiarism
is, he should ask’a professor.

“The professor should, on the
other hand, make it abundantly
clear, and there are some that
do, just what he considers
plagiarism to be in his pa-
pers.”

Problems often arise because
each professor has his own way
of defining and handling plag-
iarism. Bruce remarked, “A
professor might not turn a guy
in, but at the same time he
might flunk a guy in the course.
This has happened in the past.”

A professor is also left with
the option of wielding the sword
of Damocles over any student
whom he suspects of plagiar-
ism, making it extremely dif-
ficult for the student to do well
in the course while not flunking
him outright.

Progress is being made in the
entire area of honor violations,
and Bruce feels that the new
system of governance regula-
tions will aid the student in sev
eral Ways.

Bruce believes that the Stu-
dent Hearing Committee, form-
ed from a combination of the
Honor Court and the regulations
court, will ‘“‘speed up the pro-
cess a great deal, sparing the
student the agony of waiting
for a trial.

“Also, a student-faculty com-
mittee has been created to
make amendments to the Code
of Responsibility, which is a
real plus.”

The faculty is also acting to
update its position on plagia.-
ism. Dean of Students Will H.
Terry pointed out that the Fa-
culty Executive Committee ‘‘has
been instructed by the faculty
to write a definition of plagiar-
ism that will provide a con-
sensus of opinion for all pro-
fessors.”

Terry added, ‘‘The definition
of plagiarism differs a great
deal with course expectations,
and we are searching for a re-
liable definition flexible enough
to be interpreted by the facul-
ty.”

There is one fact that the new
system has not changed. Four
years ago a student was sus-
pended from college for two
years for a conviction of plag-
iarism. The sentence is not as
long anymore, but the punitive
damage for the character of
the victim is just as effective.

Perhaps an earnest effort in
the area of prevention might
frustrate plagiarism as well as
a cure that might rupture the
college education of an individ-
ual that is suffering only ‘from
an overdose of ignorance.
