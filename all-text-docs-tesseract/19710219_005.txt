LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
nvitation Sparks Reactions -

Davis I

To The Editor: ;

Rennie: Dayis should not
appear on this campus. The
reason is very simple. It is
financial.

‘The t¥fustees, alumni, and
some. students have been
very’ upset with some of the

recent changes that have.

been made at Davidson, such
as the allowing of alcohol
on campus, the abolishment
of fraternities from Patter-
son Court, and now the ap-
pearance of Davis as a
speaker.

(Much of Davidson's gifts
come from _ businessmen,
doctors, etc. who represent
a somewhat conservative
class in America. These re-
cent changes, including af-
filiation with NSA, have dis-
turbed these people so that
they have reduced their
gifts to the college.

In. North Carolina, almost
onethalf of the private col-

leges, including Queens, are ;

running deficits in their bud-
gets. Davidson is nearing
this. point, for it_is raising
tuition so much that it is
pricing itself out of the njar-

- ket. Since I have been here,

tuition and board have gone
up over $600.

It. is time: for the students
of Davidson to recognize
that their noble projects and
ideas have hurt the amount
of gifts given to Davidson.

_ I am sure that ‘the expen-
diture of $1000 for Davis
could have. been used for
better means, and hopefully
for means that would not
further alienate our alumni,
who are the true lifeblood
of the continued existence of
this eollege.

The ‘Impossible Dream?

DuRant Move Criticized

To The Editor:

“'The results of Chip Du-
Rant’s crusade against the
appearance of Rennie Davis
here at Davidson could prove
to be very interesting for
the future of this college.

The; only legitimate issue
in the whole mess is that
of the $1,000 which Mr.
Davis is to receive for his
contribution to our academic
community. The Administra-
tion felt compelled to say
that there is nothing actual-
ly illegal about having Mr.
Davis appear here, but that
such a choice at such a price
would probably be in poor
taste, according to the Ad-
ministration.

(Mr. DuRant has simplified
the problem somewhat by
removing the debate from
the area of real issues. He
is concerned with the effect
on Davidson's *‘image”’ the
presence of ‘‘a convicted
criminal’’ on campus will
have. :

‘By the very nature of his
position, it appears that Mr.
DuRant will not be much
impressed by some diehard
who might point out to him
that the way to support
America and ‘its institutions,

“such as freedom of speech, ~

06)

may not necessarily lie in
refusing to listen to certain
people who elect to use, or
even abuse, their freedom of
expression, or seeking to
deny them a public hearing.

It can be hoped, however,
that students who are con-
fronted with Mr. DuRant’s
petition will consider that
there is still a draft, that
the war in Asia has continu-
ed its wierd growth seeming-
ly beyond anyone’s control
or purpose, and that even at
pastoral Davidson there is
some real disagreement
about the details of our com-
munity’s functioning. Mr.
Davis has personally com-
mitted himself to. his own
answers to these sorts of
problems.

I am not sure what effect
on Wavidson’s image Mr.
Davis’ speech will have. It

does seem, though, that ap- |

plications for admission here
are way off this year, al-
though Mr. H. £. White
seems to feel that a basket-
ball. team with a national
ranking is all that we will
need to get those applica-
tions rolling again.

The cancellation of. Mr.
Davis’ scheduled appearance
would further typify this in-

e

al Mr. Rennie. Davis, I won-
der if Davidson men have
matured past the proposed
country-club state. | -

To me, education always
meant learning to differen-
tiate between those ideas
which one could accept and
those which prove untrue.

n a ‘‘well-reputed’’ cam-
pus completely closes its
ears to a viewpoint it does
not share, it fails in its edu-
cating process. _

To The Editor:

If you've kept up with re-
cent .,feature-editorial —arti-
cles in several national
news media. you've proba-
bly heard of one of the new

“est movements underway,

ay

stitution’s image as a_ pro-
vincial, parochial finishing
school with delusions of
grandeur, run primarily for
the benefit of those who have
come and gone rather than
for those who are here.

Granted, Mr. Davis will
make his plea through ~a
whirlwind of sensationalism
and promote grossly anta-
gonistic suggestions, especi-
ally if he perceives they are
having their desired effect,

What would fluster him
the,most would be to have
emotionally calm: students on
hand to pick apart the logic
of his statements or at least
to tear them away from the
created emotion which

Jesus Movement

supposedly beginning in Cali-
fornia, known as the Jesus
Movement,

The ‘astounding fact is,
however, -that this revival is
not confined to the west
coast, Tt has already begun
all over the nation . . . and,
on our campus! —

Six students from Davidson
attended a conference in THi-
nois over Christmas at which
12,300 young people from all
over the nation and world
spent four and a half days
praising, singing, learning,
and living together as
Christian brothers and_ sist
ers,

On our campus, right now,
there are weekly prayer

meetings, weekly — student
services (through the chap-
lain Seott Woodmansee and
students), daily group pray-
er, Bible-studies — several
times .a week at different
locations, groups ‘that go
around to nearby churches

to sing and sptead ‘the Good
News, and groups set up to

undertake certain projects
which they feel called to
work on,

The Jesus Movement is not
only coming, .. . it’s here!
And, if you want to give it a
chance, discuss it, or argue
against it, you shouldn't have
{oo much trouble finding a
proponent of the movement
near you.

clouds them.

If questioned either as to
whether or not he is worth
one thousand of thosé. hard-
earned green things or as to
what punpose ‘“‘our’’ money
will be used for, I could only
hazard a meaningless guess.

‘But in terms of value to
the Pavidson community's
education in our growing
sphere of existence, I see
our exposure to him as a
necessity. Bar we now the
door, it will close much
easier the next time.

To The Editor:

The latest ‘controversy on
campus concerning the com-
ing of Rennie Davis prompt-
ed me to pay closer attention
to a recently read passage.
It goes:

“Nothing is more embar-
rassing, in the. ordinary in-
tercourse of life, than this
irritable patriotism of the
Americans,

“A stranger may be well’
inclined to praise many. of
the institutions of their coun-
try, but he begs permission
to blame some things in it

a permission which is in-
exorably refused,

“America is therefore a
free country, in which, lest
anybody should be hurt’ by
your remarks, you are not
allowed to speak freely of
private individuals, or of the
state; of the citizens, or of
the authorities; of “public or
of private undertakings; or,
in short, of anything at all
; Alexis de Toque-
ville.

Does this have any bear-
ing on the free speech move-
ment of Mr. DuRant? I think

-it' doés most definitely, for

he is attempting to deprive
me of my right to hear
another side of an important
issue. |
I feel.'the coming of Ren-

nie Davis to our campus will
provide an education experi-
ence to all those who hear
him, whether they agree with
what he says or not, and this
to me is what our speaker
program is all about.

Fu Manchu Plot Exposed

To the Editor:

(Mr. Burney’s expose of our
rampant. nepotism was
enough in its way, but it
failed to turn the searchlight
of rigorous inquiry upon the
powers~behind this shocking
abuse of sound academic
personnel policy. This I now
shall do. :

The hidden hand behind the
insidious plot to plunge Da-
vidson into idiocy and men-
tal retardation is none other
than that .of the notorious
Dr. Fu Manchu.

His local agents, cleverly
disguised as grammar-grad-
ers, under-skinkers, Raleigh
men, asbsociate professors,
and campus dogs, have al-
ready set up numbered
Swiss bank accounts to re-
ceive the golden harvest

their guileful master expects.

This will have two sources:
the first from the idiots and
retardees, whose services,
after they have been turned
into human vegetables, the
plotters will farm out to the
military-industrial-labor com-

* plex, always in need of disc

jockeys, customer's men,
pickets, quiz-show audiences,
roller-derby stars,, generals
and chairmen of the board.

The second, far richer, will
come from, the exploitation
of the colossal Eskimo Pie
mines which undergird this
entire Campus. (These were
discovered, .and their exist-
ence concealed, by agents: of

the Doctor’s in the guise of |

tree-trimmers - and _power-
and-light men.) You have
been warned; sauve qui peut.

Fortunately, I am in a
position to assure the trans-
fer of any interested David-
son student into an institu-
tion of higher learning
where he and he alone will
determine his choice of stud-
ies, of teachers, of hours,
and of life-style and asso
ciates.°

Its alumni include , some
of the world’s most famous
men and. women, and its his-
tory is most impressive.

I am serious, so help me
Eli Yale; and I await the
inguiries of any and all who
feel themselves menaced by
idiocy or Eskimo Pies. Na,
turally, Mr. Burney has the
first priority for my recom-
mendation.
