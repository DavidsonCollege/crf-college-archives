ROTH PRESENTS
AN ILLUSTRATED
TALK ON ALAGKA

First Lecture Of School Year
Presented January 28 By Dr.
Robert E. Roth

LECTURE WELL ATTENDED

Talk Illustrated With Natural
Color Photographs

The first lecture offered by the school
this year was delivered in Chambers
Auditorium last Monday night, January
28, at seven o'clock when Dr. Robert E.
Roth delivered an illustrated address on
Alaska.

The lecture was enjoyable and en-
lightening due to the fact that Dr. Roth
is a man with a great deal of experience
in lecturing, and he has also visited
Alaska several times. He lectured as his
pictures were being shown and described
in detail each picture.

Dr. Roth had an unusually good type
of stereopticon, as compared to the one
usually seen. The pictures were not
changed by slides, but were character-
ized by a more continuous form of pro-
jection, the pictures fading into each
other, thus producing more of a similari-
ty to moving pictures. This is the first
time that a lecturer has used this type of
machine in a lecture at Davidson. The
pictures were arranged in their proper
sequence, and through the aid of the new
type stereopticon, Dr. Roth was able to
proceed in a very interesting manner
with his lecture.

This is the second time that the speak-
er has lectured at Davidson, and both
times he has been received by a large and
an appreciative audience. The attend-
ance Monday night was very pleasing to

Celebration Instituted As Annual
Event On Ninety-Seventh
Anniversary

The second annual celebration of
Founders’ Day will be held here on. April
9, There will be several speakers for
the occasion and the students will be
given a half holiday.

This Founders’ Day will celebrate the
ninety-eighth anniversary of the found-
ing of the college. Founders’ Day was
instituted as an annual event in the col-
lege year on the ninety-seventh anni-
versary of the founding of the college
last year.

In connection with the celebration of
the occasion, there will be Alumni meet-
ings held in many parts of the country
and speakers will be sent from ‘the col-
lege to as many of these meetings as is
possible.

It is expected that there will be a base-
base game here on the afternoon of this
day, but as yet plans for the game and
the other exercises of the day are not
yet definite. °

Last year, Dr. Ben Geer, President of
Furman, delivered. the lecture of the day
and in the afternoon the Wildcats made
a rally in the last inning of the game
with the Duke Blue Devils and won 5-4.

FEATURED PIANIST. WILL
PRESENT CONCERT HERE

Second Concert Of Series Will Be
Given By Joseph Brinkman
On February 12

IS PRAISED BY PAPERS

Artist Has Played With Chicago
Symphony

Joseph Brinkman, one of few entire-
ly American-trained pianists who have
attained distinction, will present the sec-
ond concert of the Davidson series on
Tuesday, February 12.

Mr. Brinkman, a youthful pianist,
made his debut’ with the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra. The Chicago Tribune
Says concerning his concerts: “The most
spontaneous, the most hearty, and the
longest continued applause given to any
soloist of the season fell to Joseph
Brinkman, when he appeared with the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Orches-
tra Hall... Fireworks started from all
over the keyboard under his fingers, it
is true. But he has more than virtuosi-
ty.”

The Chicago Evening American states:
“One is immediately convinced of his
remarkable musical sincerity, of the as-
surance, the superb assurance of his
technical powers, of the clarity and puri-
ty of his tone, and, above all, of the dis-
tinction, the refinement of his art. He
is a most likeable as well as a most ad-
mirable young painist.”

The Herald and Examiner adds: “He
is admirably gifted musically and has ac-
quired an enviable technical equipment. A
most brilliant player.”

The Chicago Daily News: “His gifts
as a pianist were displayed not only
through an exhaustive technical endow-
ment but also by a musical knowledge of
profound depths. He. showed here a
decided_brilliance of the quality of our
noted virtuosos.”

Pan-Hellenic Mid-Winters To

Feature Paul Sabin’s Music

With the contracting of Paul Sabin
and his orchestra with Patricia Gail,
torch singer plenipotentiary, Pan-Hellen-
ic Council officials are elated over the
Prospects for the best and least expen-
sive Mid-Winter dances yet held.

Due to a, misunderstanding with the
Music Corporation of America and a
mixup in dates with the Pan-Hellenic
Council of the University of North Car-
olina, Kay Kyser will not play at David-
son, as announced in the last issues of
The Davidsonian.

The soft style of Sabin’s music is ex-
pected to blend well with the valentine
scheme of decoration selected by the
Council, The! Charlotte Armory has
been engaged for all three dances and
it will be decorated, according to the
‘Council, at the most expensive cost yet
placed in a Pan-Hellenic budget for dec-
orations.

“The Council,” stated Mims Rogers,
president, “wishes to reiterate its an-
nounced purpose of not intending to

make any profit from these Mid-Winter
dances. Its only aim is to provide an
enjoyable set of dances that will ap-
proach those held at larger colleges.”

After much effort to obtain the best
orchestra which would fit its determined
budget, Rogers stated that the Council
felt confident as it expressed the opinion
that the music for these dances is the
finest possible and will prove thoroughly
enjoyable in every respect.

Featured with Sabin’s band are Miss
Patricia Gail, Bob Carter and Paul Sabin
himself. ,Carter;~ formerly with Paul
Whiteman, sings in the “Skinny Ennis”
style of vocalizing and Sabin himself is
an accomplished master of ceremonies,
having been with Publix Theatres and
made several short subjects with Uni-
versal ‘and Metro-Goldwin Mayer.

“The music of Sabin’s Band,” reads
his commercial advance, “is a charming
potpourri of distinctive arrangements of
rhumbas and tangos, diversified with

Faculty Members
Attend Convention

Assemble With Presidents And
Deans Of Church-Related
Colleges In Atlanta

At a recent meeting of the National
Conference of Church-Related Colleges,
held in Atlanta, Ga., on January 16-18,

three members of the administration
here represented Davidson College.
President W. L. Lingle, Dr. T. W.

Lingle, and Mr. F. L,. Jackson took leave
of their duties on the campus to meet
with five hundred college presidents and
deans at their twenty-fourth annual con-
vention.

The general theme for the three-day
conference was, “The Church-Related
College in American Education,” and
starting with the meeting on Wednes-
day, addresses were delivered by promi-
nent figures in the field of education,
following the general theme. The most
enlightening address of this nature was
delivered by Colonel Frank Knox, editor
and publisher of The Chicago Daily
News. He took for his subject “The
Church-Related College in a Changing
Social Order,” in which he gave his im-
pressions of the educational and religious
situation in Russia and Germany today.

As was brought out during the con-
ference, which includes Church-related
colleges of all: denominations, the finan-
cial problem proved to be the most signi-
ficant and the one worthy of most con-
sideration by the representatives. Mr.
Jackson, treasurer of Davidson and
chairman of the committee on Perma-
nent and Trust Funds, submitted an ex-
cellent report before the conference on
Thursday.

The meetings on Thursday and Fri-
day were open to the university repre-
sentatives as well as those of the col-
leges. The guests in the city were very
much pleased with the musical renditions
offered by the Emory University Glee
Club on Thursday. This organization
has won prominence in music circles over
the entire country.

Most important of the activities to-
ward the close of the conference were

tilage had locked his knee in a bent
position one morning about a month
ago.

Fred McPhail underwent an ap-
pendicitis operation last Thursday
night in Charlotte, following a fairly
acute attack suffered during a

Dr. Arbuckle Resumes

His Duties As Teacher

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, professor of
Chemistry, resumed his duties with the
Chemistry department at the beginning
of the new semester last Monday, after
an of several months due
illness.

Dr. Arbuckle was taken seriously ill
last summer while on a vacation trip.
He spent several weeks in a_ hospital
and was removed to his home at David-
son just after the start of the first
semester in September.

Although his condition was very criti-
cal for a while, his recovery was swift.
He has recovered enough to take up part
of his regular work this semester. At
present he is teaching only one hour a
day, but he plans to take over another
class in the immediate future.

| Announces Definite Refusal Of
Coaching Post At His Old
Alma Mater

FORMER ALL-AMERICAN

Popular Coach’s Decision Hailed
With Great Satisfaction

The Davidson Coaching Staff will in
all probability remain intact for the 1935
football’ season since Coach Gene Mc-
Ever, All-American halfback and David-
son’s backfield coach, announced his in-
tention to remain at Davidson for 1935.

It had been known for sometime that
the University of Tennessee, McEver’s
Alma Mater, had been considering him
for a position, and McEver’s decision to
remain with the Wildcats was received
with deep satisfaction on the hill, among
officials and students alif.

McEver received the first definite offer
shortly after Christmas, and was con-
sidering it seriously, since it offered a
much better financial arrangement than
did Davidson College. About two weeks
ago he received a visit from Major W.
H. Britton, now head coach of the Ten-
nessece Vols, and Col. P. V. Parker, di-
rector of athletics. For a while it look-
ed as if the popular and successful
Davidson coach was about to leave.

Shortly afterwards, faculty and stu-
dents were pleased by the announcement
of his decision to remain, and in an in-
terview this morning he stated that he
was completely satisfied with arrange-
ments for next year.

McEver was picked for the official
All-American football team of 1929 and
although he was out the following year,
in 1931 he received places on numerous
selections: and was one of the nations
high scorers.

Major Bob Neyland, who just rounded
out a nine-year hitch as head coach at
the University of ‘Tennessee, rated Mc-
Ever above the great back, Beattie
Feathers, now with the Professional
Chicago Bears.

McEver's backfields at Davidson have
been fast and smart and have won for
him’ popularity throughout the State.

Account Of Hauptmann’s Trial

By Jack WILLIAMS, Jr., ’34
(Special to The Davidsonian)

Flemington, N. J., January 15, 1935.—
Of all people in the world Fleming-
tonians are perhaps least interested in
the “Trial of a Century” which is now
in progress in their County Court house.
They are calmly indifferent for two
reasons. They have peen Col. Lindbergh
and Mrs. Hauptmann and it would do
little good to get excited because there
are only 127 seats available to spectators
and try and get one. Outsiders will drive
all day and stand in line from 12:00
o’clock midnight until 10:00 o’clock the
next morning for one of these seats.
Flemington citizens are not that much
interested. However, it does make some
of them mad not to be able to attend a
trial-in their own Court House. After
all they are paying for it. So when

trial which is going on across the street
it buys a New York paper or. tunes in
on the radio.

They have only sympathy for Haupt-
mann, ‘They do not feel resentful of
his presence but regard him as a char-
acter in a play who has changed the
whole drama of the community. The
manager of the Union Hotel, of 27
rooms was greatly upset on hearing that
the wihter snugness of Flemington was
to be disturbed. “I’ve got my paying
customers,” he said, “and I don’t want
to run the risk of disatisfying ’em by all
these foreigners coming in.” However,
the jury of eight men and four women
are being fed three meals a day at his
hotel and the jingle of the cash register
should in a measure make up for this
discomfort. “Foreigners” have so com-
pletely taken charge of the hotel that

Flemington wants to know about the
