Davidson focusing attention on date rape

By Jessica GooDsoN
News Editor

The 900 Room was so crowded
for Take Back the Night in March
that Health Educator Georgia Ringle
feared we were in violation of the
fire code.

Although she is always pleased
to see such a large turnout, Ringle
says it
“upsets”
her that,
despite
the fact
that numerous women present per-
sonal accounts, very few cases of
acquaintance — or date — rape are
actually reported to campus police.
No incidents of sexual assault were
reported during the 1996-97 school
year.

She believes that, more often

than not, “individuals are told pri-
vately of incidents,” and that pro-
grams such as Take Back the Night
are more representative than police
reports of the estimated one in five
students who are victims of some
form of sexual assault. Experts
estimate that as many as 90 percent
of all rapes are never reported. Of
those reported, approximately 60
percent of the victims

know their assailants.

Because they

compromise one’s

ability to make respon-

sible decisions, alcohol and drugs
are often a significant factor in ac-
quaintance rape. Many victims say
later that they drank too much or
took too many drugs to realize what
was going on; by the time they
realized their predicament, it was

too late. Ringle cites heavy drink-.

ing as a particular problem that
causes confusion over what is con-
sensual.

According to the CORE Alco-
hol and Drug Survey, 38 percent of
Davidson students reported engag-
ing in sexual intercourse within the
past year, 48 percent of which used
alcohol or drugs the last time they
had intercourse. Ringle says she
doesn’t have total confidence in
these figures. She believes that
guilt prevents many students from
indicating that they are sexually
active.

CORE also reports that of 134
women surveyed, 11 percent felt
they had been taken advantage of
sexually. Of 105 men surveyed, a
shocking 27 percent felt that they
had they had been taken advantage
of sexually. Fourteen percent of the
men surveyed admitted to taking

advantage of a sexual partner, but
only 1.5 percent of women reported
they had done the same.

Incidents of sexual assault usu-
ally go unreported due to feelings of
ambiguity, overwhelming guilt,
embarrassment, and shame. There
is often a sense of wanting to get on
with life and put the experience in
the past. But, as one woman pointed
out at Take Back the Night, this puts
one in the awkward position of en-
countering their assailant in the fu-
ture. This is especially true of a
small campus like Davidson.

In her P.E. 101 presentations,
Ringle has made it clear that sexual
assault will not be tolerated at
Davidson.
issue up to a cadre of students who
can be first responders and rape
awareness educators,” she added.

“Issues cycle through Davidson

‘We want to open this. '

about every four years,” Ringle said.

And sexual assault is no exception.

In past years, Davidson has worked

ona women’s support program and

formed a group of faculty, staff, and

students who could be “safe people” :
for victims to tell anonymously.

Although figures would indi-
cate that there is little need for a
rape prevention program at
Davidson, Take Back the Night, the
CORE report, and her counseling
experience lead Ringle to believe
otherwise.

In an attempt to make rape re-
sponse a permanent fixture and a
visible option, Davidson will train
resident advisors, who are already
in a position of authority, to re-_
spond to rape situations.

Katie Koestner’s visit marks
the first time training of this kind
has been available at Davidson.

President Clinton nominates Davidson graduate as next
chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities

By David KANG
Staff Writer

William R. Ferris, Class of “64,
has been selected to lead the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humani-
ties into the 21st century.

President Clinton recently
nominated the expert on Southern
culture and folklore, with prompt
confirmation from the Senate ex-
pected.

Ferris, a native of Vicksburg,
Miss., has always had a fascination

- with folklore.

“From the time I can first re-
member I was sitting at my
granddad’s knee listening to stories
from the Old Testament and about
Ali Baba and the 40 thieves,” said
Ferris.

“I guess growing up ona farm .

in Mississippi and having a grand-
father who is a storyteller put me in

touch with things that were very
basic to my world, and I was never
really able to leave after I grew up.”

Ferris pursued his love of the
humanities at Davidson, where he
gained many experiences that would
shape his future work.

“One of the things I remem-
bered was a black man who was a
janitor in our dorm, who played
guitar,” reflected Ferris.

“T used to listen to his finger

picking style

and try toemu-
late it in my

own basic way
with a little
guitar that I
had. I can stll

A lifetime

efforts

Ferris
had originally
hoped to be.a
writer. He won
several writing
awards at
Davidson
while produc-
ing poetry, fic-
tion, and a one-
act play.

“That
was a very im-
portant experi-
ence at
Davidson,”
said Ferris,

lore grew out
of it.

“T think
Davidson was
an important
crucible for
change in my
life, and it re-

ally opened -

opportunities for me that were truly
important in a fundamental, kind of
profound way. I think the quality of
teaching, the calibre of students that
I was privileged to know there were
the very best in the nation, and still
are,” he added.

Ferris’ writing ability is evi-
denced in his 13 documentary films
and 10 books. U.S. News & World
Report recognized the Encyclope-
dia of Southern Culture, co-edited
by Ferris, as “the first attempt ever
to describe every aspect of aregion’s
life and thought, the impact of its
history and politics, music and lit-
erature, manners and myths, even
the iced tea that washed down cat-
fish and cornbread.”

The work won the American
Library Association’s Dartmouth
Medal.

A Love for the South

After earning his B.A. in En-
glish Literature, Ferris went on to
obtain an M.A. from Northwestern
and a Ph.D. in folklore from the
University of Pennsylvania. He
taught English at Jackson State
University before moving on to
teach Afro-American and Ameri-
can studies at Yale.

Ferris found his true calling in
1979, when he founded the Center
for the Study of Southern Culture at
the University of Mississippi.

During his tenure, the Center
has gained national recognition as a
preeminent source of Southern in-
formation. It offers both B.A. and
M.A. degrees in Southern Studies,
and has hosted conferences on ev-
erything from the works of William
Faulkner to “In Search of Elvis:
Music, Race, Religion, Art, Perfor-
mance.” Ferris’ recent nomination
to chair the N.E.H. comes as the
greatest honor of his life.

“Tt is something I have never
dreamed would happen to me,” said
Ferris, “and still believe it is some-
thing unreal. It is so different from
anything I have experienced.

The N.E.H. provides grants to
support research in the humanities,
educational opportunities for teach-
ers, and preservation of texts and
materials, among other things.

These grants work to support our
national heritage and promote life-
long learning.

Ferris certainly has his work
cut out for him. Certain Republi-
cans in Congress have been mount-
ing a drive to eliminate both the
N.E.H. and its sister organization,
the National Endowment for ‘the
Arts.

But Ferris has strong support
from key Republicans. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and
Senator Thad Cochran, both from
Mississippi, wrote Clinton a letter
of endorsement upon hearing of
Ferris’ consideration. Ferris, an
independent, is “honored to have
their support.”

“In many ways this nomina-
tion is a recognition of our state and
our region, and I feel a strong re-
sponsibility to do the very best I
can.

New Vision

Intaking the helm ofthe N.E.H.,
Ferris will utilize his years of expe-
rience at the Center. His work has
been instrumental in preserving
knowledge about the South. The
position at the humanities endow-
ment will require this on a larger
scale.

Regarding his overall goals,
Ferris said, “I would like to
strengthen and build on the out-
standing programs that are already
there and be as sensitive as possible
to the interests of the President, of
Congress, and of the American
people, and try to make the endow-
ment, to the fullest extent possible,
areflection of the American experi-
ence and all that it implies for edu-
cation.”
