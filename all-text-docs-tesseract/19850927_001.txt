ersonel Shifts Fill Student’s Office

Harriette Root

By KELLY DIXON

Anyone who has been in the
Dean of Students office this year
noticed some changes. Apart from
the cosmetic differences, two new
assistant deans of students now in-
habit the office. Paula Moore Mil-
ler and Harriette Root are familiar
faces on the Davidson College
campus, Miller having served ona
divided-time basis as assistant
dean of students, and Root work-
ing in the Career’s office as assis-
tant director.

Becoming a full-time dean of
students allows Miller the in-
creased availability she desired.
Serving in the admissions office,

she was often out of town when
students needed her. Miller has re-
cently moved to Davidson from
Charlotte, a move she hopes will
enable her to be on hand for the
frequent “after hours” activities of
the dean of Students office.
Harriet Root moved into her
new admissions office in July.
Counseling is a large part of her
background. Apart from her train-
ing from UNCC, she did quite a
bit of counseling while working in
the Career’s office. Relating her
Career’s office work to her new
position, Root said most of her
projects before dealt with off-
campus interests, whereas this job

involves more immediate atten-
tion to on-campus problems. She
also feels that Dean Terry has al-
lowed the two new assistant deans
free reign to develop their posi-
tions as they see fit.

“There is a good, fluid, work-
ing relationship between the two
(Root and Miller’s) offices,” Root
says. “If a student sees one of us
one time and the other the next
time, that’s no problem.” And
earth-shattering changes for DC
or the dean’s office? Root says she
will primarily act as “facilitator”
for changes initiated by students.

Faculty Dean’s Resignation Effective In Spring

‘By ANDREA DIEDRICH ~ ”

T.C. Price Zimmermann,
Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs and Dean of the Faculty, sub-
mitted his resignation to President
John Kuykendall on Monday,
September 23. He requested to be
relieved of his current duties at the
end of this school year.

Kuykendall accepted Zim-
mermann’s resignation on the
same day. In a memorandum to
the faculty and administrative
staff Kuykendall said, “his in-
tended retirement at the end of this
academic year from the Office of
Vice President for Academic Af-
fairs and Dean of the Faculty is
news which I can accept only with
the greatest reluctance.” In the
same memorandum Kuykendall
requested that the Executive Cim-
mitte of the Faculty serve as a
Search Committee for Zimmer-
mann’s successor. He also re-
quested that Professor Ben Klein,
vice chairman pro temof the facul-
ty serve as Chairman of the search
process. The Search Committee
met for the first time on Wednes-
day, September 25.

In his letter to members of the

faculty and administrative staff
officer, Zimmermann, who is be-
ginning his ninth year at his cur-
rent position, write, “Now I feel
the time has come to return to
teaching and scholarship.” Zim-
mermann plans to go on sebatical
at the end of this school year and
then return to Davidson the fol-
lowing year to teach history.

“T can’t imagine any group of
students I would rather teach,” he
said.

In his letter Zimmermann
wrote, “I am looking forward . . .
to completing long-range scholar-
ly projects laid aside at the time of
assuming administrative office.”
One of those projects is to com-
plete a book about a 16th century
Italian historian he said.

Zimmermann emphasized in
his letter his confidence in
Kuykendall's presidency and the
steady growth of Davidson “as a
leader among liberal arts col-
leges” as two reasons why he feels
comfortable in submitting his res-
ignation at this time.

Zimmermann said he has had
offers from the institutions but has
chosen to stay at Davidson. “I’ve

invested a great deal of myself in
Davidson, and I am very attached
to it,” he said. “My wife and I
want to remain a part of this com-
munity.”

In his letter Zimmermann also
pledged “every assistance possi-
ble” to Kuykendall and to his suc-
cessor. When asked what qualities
he hoped for in his successor he
said, “One always hopes one’s
successor will be a brilliant indi-
vidual who will accomplish ev-
erything one hoped to do and
didn’t.”

According to Klein, the
Search Committee plans to begin
advertising right away for Zim-
mermann’s successor. They plan
to conduct a national search
through The Chronicle of Higher
Education.

At the meeting on Wednesday
the Committee laid out general
plans for the search. They plan to
process all received applications
with the strictest confidentiality,
Klein said. This means they will
not release the names of anyone
who has applied until they begin
conducting interviews on campus.
“When applicants do visit the

campus we hope to involve facul-
ty, administration and students in
the selection,” he said. They hope
to be able to start interviewing by
January.

The search committee did not
make any specific criteria for
Zimmermann’s successor accord-
ing to Klein. “I think it would be a
serious mistake to get rigid
guidelines,” he said. Klein felt
that the only guideline that is
likely to be imposed is that who-
ever holds the position has their

Paula Moore Miller

doctorate. Gender, race and age
should have no effect on the selec-
tion he said.

The next official meeting of
the Executive Committee is
Wednesday, October 9, although
Klein said it is possible the Search
Committee will meet before then.
The Executive Committee is com-
posed of members of the faculty
who are elected to three year
terms; Kuykendall, Zimmermann
and Dean of Stydents Will Terry.
