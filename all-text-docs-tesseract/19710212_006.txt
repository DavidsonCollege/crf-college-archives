The Ravidsontan

Trussell Authors ‘Loving Book’

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

One of every six brides in
the United States is pregant
on her wedding day.

Between one million and
two million induced abor-
tions occur in the United
States each year at an an-
nual cost that has been esti-
mated at $350,000,000.

Six per cent of all unmar-
ried women in the United
States who had coitus have
been pregnant by the age
of 15,

The substantial lack of in-

formation concerning contra-,<?

ception and birth control,
which these statistics re-
flect, provided the mo iva-
tion for senior James Trus-
sell. to ‘write ‘‘The Loving
Book,’’ a pamphlet dealing
with various methods of
birth control.

“Almost all the literature
on birth control which ts
available, is directed toward
indigent populations. The
more | read on the subject,
the more | began to feel
that students are neglected.

“Sex editcation is poor, and
it is hard for students to se-
cure methods of birth con-
trol. It is also hard for them
‘to get abortions ‘unless
they're rich,”’ Trussell said.

Consequently, Trussell
wrote ‘The Loving Book’’
which discusses _—- various
methods of birth control and
how effective each method
is. But the book also con-
tains a section in which in-
formation is given concern-
ing where a person would
go in his local area to re-
ceive information on abor-
tions. or get prescriptions
for birth control pills.

Trussell became interest-
ed in this field of study
after working two summers
In established family plan-
ning programs. —

“T've been interested in
birth control and population
control since high school, In
work'ng in this area I found
that the greatest problem is
that information was not
getting to the people.”’ Trus-
sell said.

“Either the information
was given in comic book
form where everthing was
too simpl:fied, or it appear-
ed in scientific journals

Davis Gives Views On Birth

By DOUGLAS BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

“In general, Davidson stu-
dents are probably not well
informed on birth control
methods,”’ said Dr. William
Davis, college physician,
‘during an ihterview this
week, The vast majority are
aware of the pill and the
condom, Davis believes, but
he does not feel that most
have a very broad knowledge
of birth control methods.

‘In a sense, we are just
emerging from -the Victor-
ian Era,’’ commented Davis.
According to him,  ‘‘nice
péople’” did not “talk about

birth control publicly in. SOF

past.
- Davis has no idea wai

where the = could not
understand it.’’ he continu-
ed,

Last summer Trussell par-
ticlpated in an_ internship
on population education
which was offered by the In-
stitute for the Study of
Health and Society.

His purppse was to deve-
lop a- model pamphlet on
birth control which could be
adapted to all areas with
the addition of information
about local referral agencies
for abortions or .birth con-
trol prescriptions.

The Charlotte Planned
ed Parenthood organization,
which sponsored the printing
of this pamphlet in this area,
was responsible for under-
writing the. 11,000 copies
which are being distributed
at area colleges including
Central Piedmont, Davidson,
Johnson C. Smith, Queens;
and the University of North

' Carolina at Charlotte.

Each student at these col-
leges receives one free copy.
If they desire additional
ones, copies will be sold for
$.50 each.

Steve Chandler, a student
at Florida Presbyterian Col-
lege, assisted Trussell in the
compilation of information.
Chandler also participated in
the population internship.

On’ the: subject of abor-
tions, Trussell said, ‘‘Under
no circumstances should a
woman undergo a compul-
pregnancy. Although
this situation involves the re-
lationship between the man
and the woman, the ultimate
decision should be_ that of
the woman.

“There is really one objec-
tion to abortion — that it
is murder. My contention is
that life is a process, a con-
tinuum. The fetus is only one
stage in the process.

‘Whether the fetus is a hu-
man or not is a theological
question which can be .argu-
ed from now, til eternity
without an answer being
found. The fetus is more
than an appendix but less
than a human being; there-
fore the rights of the moth-
er come prior to the rights
of the fetus.”

‘In reference to abortion
laws, Trussell noted that
most abortion laws on the

student body has engaged in
pre-marital sex. He pointed
out that surveys have shown
that sexual activity among
college students is on the in-
crease, but he does not be-

. Heve that the incerase is a

much as many think.

‘A girl does not necessari-
ly lose her virginity at col-
lege,’’ commented Davis.

He continued by saying; ‘‘I
have seen a change in _atti-
tude. Many of the young de-
cide not to engage ‘in sexual
-activities: Jt is important
to realize that there are
more open discussions on
this subject than in the past.

red years old. At the time
they were made abortions
were very dangerous. Today
the conditions have changed
but the laws have not, ac-
cording to Trussell.

Commenting .on. North
Carolina’s abortion laws,
Trussell said these laws are
unconstitutional, since the
same law was ruled uncon-
stitutional in Georgia. .

“Art Jones, however, is
planning to introduce legi-
slation which would in ef-
fect silow for the woman
and her physician to deter-
mine the efficacy of an
abortion,’ said Tryssell. ‘’!
think this is a better route
to change these laws than
going through the courts.”

Concerning. college _infir-
maries in general, Trussell
said he felt they should ac-
cept the responsibility of
distributing contraceptives
as a part of the health needs
of the students.

“If Davidson continues
the program of allowing
coeds to attend this school,
the infirmary should | take
the responsibility for them,”
he said.

“The availability of con-
traceptives in no way en-
courages promiscuity. In al-
most every case I know, a
couple decided to use a con-
traceptive after initial’ sex-
ual intercourse.”

Davis Views Sex Book

A REVIEW
By WILLIAM A. DAVIS Jr.

M.D.
College Physician

(Having known for nearly
a year that Jimmy Trussell
was working on this, I have
awaited its appearance with
a good deal of anticipation.
Now after a proper period
of pregnancy, Jimmy has
labored and delivered his
child which, on exantination,
is found to be a beautiful
healthy. baby.

‘He begins by making cer-
tain assumptions regarding
the need for such a book. If
one accepts these conditions,
there can be no objection to
the publication.

In the preface, he states
the purpose of the book is
not to offer moral judg-

talk about this does not
mean that sexual promis-
cuity has increased drama-
tically.”

When’ judging which birth
control methods are best,
Davis believes they should
be judged according to their
effectiveness - and satisfac-
tion. “The most effective
method of birth control is

' abstinance, ‘but this -is- not

very. satisfying,’’ said. Dr.

Davis.

Abstinance aside, the birth
control pill is the most
effective birth control met-
hod according to Davis. Its
drawbacks are that it is usb-

_ ject to human error such as

the girl forgetting to take it.
The pill is also the most
satisfying method, both in

items.

ments but ‘‘to elise int basic
information about biology
and contraceptive care, of
which every college student
should be aware.”’

The book is divided into ON
Anatomy,

four sections;
Physiology (female), Birth
Control, and Venereal Dis-
ease. -

The anatomy section is
well done, with good ilustra-
tion and written in.non-tech-
nical (although technically
correct) language.

The portion dealing with
the female physiology (men-
strual cycle) is somewhat
more technical -and could be
abbreviated without sacrific-
ing the basic context.

However, the thoughtful
reader would prefer, I
think, to. know ‘‘why,” rath-

the art of sexual intercourse.

Of course if one is mar-
ried and has about five
children and no desire: for
more, the best method is

Birth’ contro] pills require
a prescription, and Davis
thinks that most students
would be able to. get them.

er than have to accept the
facts without any  know-
ledge of the relationships
which produce these facts.

The greatest portion of the
book is- devoted to the vari-
aus methods of birth con-
trol. A factual discussion of
each is given, followed in
each instance by a list of
the advantages and disad-
vantages.

Quite properly, no attempt
is made to push.one method
over another. However they
are compared. according to
statistical effectiveness. An
important point which is in-
cluded is the approximate
price of each method.

The final section of the
book deals with venereal
disease. The descriptions ‘of
the symptoms are sufficient-
ly clear to alert anyone to
the possibility of these infec-
tions and to seek Pane
treatment. :

The “last few pages may
be the most important of the
entire book, particularly to
students in the Piedmont
area. of North Carolina.
These list various persons
who have indicated a _will-
ingness to__counsel, treat,
prescribe, and - otherwise
help the student who has a

; problem.

There is one feature: which
puts the icing on an already
great cake. These are’ the
photographs, found through-
out the book, of the magni-
fitient Vigeland sculptures
which are obviously intend-
ed to show the natural beau-
ty. of the human body.

In summary, must read-
ing for some, recommended
for’all.
