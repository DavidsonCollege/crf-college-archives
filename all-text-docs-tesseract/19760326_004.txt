A

College seeks to purchase
rare lands on Rocky River

By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor

Davidson College officials
are currently involved in nego-
tiations concerning’ the
possible purchase of a 15 acre
tract of land along the Rocky
River, according to Craven E.
Williams, Vice President for
Development.

“The land is of special
interest because of the unusual
amount of rare plants growing
there, most notably the fern
Pellea wrightena, there being
only one other small colony
east of Oklahoma. This site, in
Stanly county, is also geolog-
ically exciting; it is the only
area in the state with 100 foot
tall slate cliffs,’ Professor of
Biology Tom Daggy stated.

He said that Tom Hatley,
class of 1974, and several
classmates had come across
the area while hiking. The
location had not been prev-
iously reported and the
Davidson College Biology
department quickly notified
other schools about the find.

Williams explained that
‘The place is mostly owned by
a.lawyer who owns the sur-
rounding land and is selling it
to contractors for develop-
ment. The various people from
different schools who have
become involved with this
have acted to preserve the
bluff and its flora.”

In a meeting Tuesday night
in Albemarle (in Stanly
County) Hattey, Woody
Connette '74, representatives
from UNCC, the “Botanical
Gardens, Daggy, Business
Manager Robert Currie, and
Biology Professor David C.
Grant, discussed with the
owner the feasibility of pur-
chasing the land.

At the meeting a Dr. Liby
from.Albemarle, a retired Air
Force colonel described by
Daggy as “‘interested in con-
servation,’’ made a $1000
deposit in good faith toward
the raising of the remaining

funds.

_ “We're very sympathetic to
this cause,’’ Williams said,
continuing, ‘‘and we aren’t
thinking about contributing a
set amount. We'll give our fair
share, a modest amount in
conjunction with the other
schools.”’

The area has been proposed
for registration as a national
Natural Landmark, with ‘the
highest priority in North
Carolina,’’ according to
Williams.

The conservationists have
now been granted a limited
time to obtaining sufficient
funds and Daggy indicated
that they will soon meet with
the Stanly County Commis-
sions to seek a_ sizable
contribution. ‘‘If they help us
it will be one of the few times
in the country a county has
contributed like this,’’ he
noted.

Grant stated that there are
several different ways in which
Biology Department personnel
are attempting to raise money.
“Getting funds from college is
one of our ideas, and another
is contacting alumni who
majored in biology. Individ-
ual contributions will be
warmly welcomed,’’ he hinted.

The richness and outstand-
ing variety of the botanical
wonders found around the
cliffs excited Daggy. He said
that botany experts from as
far away as the University of
Michigan have become inter-
ested in the site and will help
to preserve it.

“This area is interesting for
more reasons than the excep-
tional fern. A professor from
UNCC, and he’s very exper-
ienced in this field, said that it
contained probably the best
community of chalk maple,
hop cornbeam, and leather-
wood trees that he’s seen.
None of them are common in
this state,’’ Daggy explained.
He added that there was a rare
species of mustard there also;

Arabis laevigata Missour-

‘The potentials for field
studies in botany and ecology
are too valuable to waste.
There are varieties of plant life
unmatched in the eastern
United States, and we’re
grateful for the opportunity to
preserve them,”’ he continued.

Daggy concluded by prais-
ing Hatley for ‘‘his selfless
efforts in organizing the
attempt to save this land. He
has put in in much time and
effort, all at his own expense,
in stirring up interest.’’

THIEF! The athletic department is

they will in all reality come
from the Wildcat Club
program.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. explained any
possible increases in monies
allocated to the basketball
program.

“If you are committed to a
national level program you’ve
got to be willing to spend at
least what is required in
comparison to other private
institutions involved,’’ he
said.

“The money  wouldn’t
come out of the College’s
regular budget,’’ continued
Spencer, ‘‘nor would it be a
capital funds ‘:program.”’

“The pool of basketball
players we have to choose
from is much smaller than it
would be at a less demanding
institution, however,’’ said
Spencer, ‘‘the new coach is
going to have to work very
hard to find players, black or
white, that are qualified aca-
demically.”’

“We'll constantly search for
the Bill Bradley’s,’’ he
continued.

There is a certain amount of
faculty and student pressure

against Davidson’s attempt to
return into the national bas-
ketball limelight. Professor of
Religion Max E. Polley is
“generally against financial
aid for athletes.’’

“You’re talking about
buying an athlete,”’ he said.

POLLEY

Polley maintains that the
‘price’ paid by the students,
specifically athletes, who find

themselves put in the position -

of playing NCAA division I
basketball at a school with
high academic standards is far
too high.

“T believe that if the alumni
and student body knew the
price you pay for national
prominence, it would not be
desired,’’ said Polley.

“T just don’t think it’s good
for Davidson,’’ he continued.
Having a nationally ranked
basketball team is ‘‘a source of
embarassment to a faculty
member. You have to explain
you’re not letting academic
standards fall,’ said Polley.
‘I believe that athletics
ought to be extracurricular
activities,” said Polley.
Spencer reiterated the
explanation that a nationally
ranked basketball team would
greatly aid the college, mostly
through national publicity.

According to him the sports
media found Davidson ‘‘a
phenomenon. Here’s a small
school with high academic
standards which made people
sit up.”’

Associate Editor of The
Davidsonian, Tony Snow
concurred with Spencer to a
degree.

‘The faculty hated Driesell,
said Snow. ‘But if you look at
the records, the sixties were
when Davidson had more-of its
fellowships and more of its
Rhodes scholarships than
ever.”’

“People go to school for the
wrong reasons,” he concluded.
