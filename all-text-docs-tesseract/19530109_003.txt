lege every year about this time.

If Charlie, an amiable guy in his middle thirties, had been
clobbered over the head with a sledgehammer he ‘would hardly
had any worse headaches than he had when his rassling squad
all but fell apart just before the Yule season. Charlie had enough
to worry about early in the year when he found out that Bobby
Joe Key, his big little man in the 123-pound class, was in-
eligible for scholastic reasons. But that was only a starter.

Headache No. 2 came to Packer when Gene Craven,
the guy who handles the work in the 147-pound class so
well got a shoulder hurt in the Four-Way meet which
opened the season for the Cat wrestlers. It wasn't hurt
badly, and Gene would have been able to wrestle again in
a few weeks. So what happens? Craven wrenches the
shoulder again during Christmas vacation doing some mov-
ing. so he won’t be in top shape. for some time.

Now take the case of Morley Vail. All see for a great sea-
son and a diploma at the end of the year, Vail got the news
before Christmas .from his draft board that they’d like to see
him around at the first of the year. Exit Vail. Exit also more
chances of success for Charlie Parker and the Davidson Wrestling
team.

(During the holidays, Morley found he'd have until Jan-
uary 22 before the Army wanted him. He'll finish the semester
but will of course miss the biggest part of the wrestling season.)

The next blow to Patker & Company came when Don
Reid hurt a foot up at Chapel Hill when the Cat groaners tangled
with the matmen from UNC. Reid, a promising newcomer in
the 137-pound class, is O.K. now, but his injury didn’t do
anything to dispel the cloud of gloom over the team’s prospects
for the season.

Take finally the case of Roy White, the versatile ath-
lete who was shaping up well in the 177-pound class. Roy,
a senior, has decided he would prefer Navy Blues to Army
OD's, so he’s planning to join up in the near future.

That, in something more than a nutshell, is the plight of
Parker & Co. Charlie's not thinking of slipping any ringers in
yet (the Jungle Boy, we hear, may be interested if the price is
right), but this situation is the kind which is calculated to make
coaches do rash things.

Parker's still got some good men on his team, including
John Buxton, Charlie Murray, Bill Coe, Bill McElveen and
Nabby Armfield, who will continue to turn in good per-
formances on the mats for D.C. But with such men as Vail,
Craven, and Key out of action or hurt for important meets, the
Cat grapplers will hardly burn up the Conference this year.

For Cat Matmen

Coach Charlie Parker's Wild-
cat Wrestling team will tangle
with the untested N. C. State
Grodaners Monday night on the
Wolfpack’s home mat at Ral-
eigh. in the Cats’ second dual
meet of the early season.

Little is known of the State
squad, as this will be their first
match of the season, but pre-sea-
son ratings have led Coach Parker
and the squad to believe that they
will have quite a job on their hands
Monday night.

Adding to the imminent trouble,
Parkers points out that 147-pound-
er Captain Morley Vail and Bobby
Joe Key, the 123-pound man, will
miss the State mect. Géne Craven
and Don Reid, both of whom will
probably see action Monday night,
are hindered by injuries. ©

Anybody Got a BC Handy?

In the Wildcats’ first meet of
the season they were defeated
by a very strong UNC team,
17-11, at Chapel Hill, Morley
Vail and Charlie Murray
showed up very well for Da-
vidson in their matches.

Coach Parker will have four
wrestlers battling it out for the
167 and 177-pound classes and
the heavyweight division, the
weakest points of the team. The
squad is expected to round into
top’ shape by midseason, and by
then Coach Parker expects to have
the usually strong Davidson team
in top shape.

The probable starters for Da-
vidson: David Jones or Don
Craig, 123 Ibs.; Charlie Mur-
ray, 130 ‘lbs.; Don Reid, 137
Ibs.; Gene Craven, 147 Ibs;
John Buxton, 157 Ibs.; Bill Coe

‘Coach Hambright reports his
team is in poor condition now with
a lot of hard work being needed
to bring them around to winning

for Tuesday’s action.

Sophomore Al Ormond, _ in-

freshman Jeff Smith in that

Clemson was the weakest team
Davidson faces this season, and
going into the last event the score
was 38-39: the men from South

Fast Start In Week's Action

The long interfraternity basket-
ball season got under way Monday
night, and games have been played
every night in the week since then.
Following are reports of games
played through Wednesday night:

, KA 43; Betas 37

The Betas tasted defeat at the
hands of-a consistently scoring KA
team led by Lefty Vance with 14
points. The Betas’ Charlie Hasty
was the individual high scorer with
17 points, but his teammates were
unable to follow his lead.

SPE 32; SAE 30

This very close game was won
for the SPEs by Fred Stowe who
turned in a total of 16 points. The
SAEs‘ chief asset was Bud Dun-
can who garnered 7 points.

Phi. Delts 73; Sigma Chis 71

The Phi Delts were able to sneak
by the Sigma Chis due to Ted
Oldenberg’s whopping total of 24
points. The Sigma Chi team played
a well balanced game with Tyler
Berry Collecting 21 points.

With freshman Doug Oldenburg

points, the Phi Delts rolled to an
impressive 48 to 32 victory over
the Betas. Bill Bivins also con-
tributed 15 points to the Phi Delt
cause while George Thomas was
high for the losers with ten points.

Pikas 36; Pi Kapps 34

With a third period rally that
netted 18 points, the Pikas were
able to squeeze out a 36 to 34 vic-
tory over the strong I'i Kapps.

center, scored 15 points to lead the

meets with such teams as N. C.
State and North Carolina staring
them in the face. State has twelve
men on scholarships, while UNC
has long reigned as a power in
Southern Conference pools.

Having their first three mects
away is, of course, no advantage
for the locals.

Hambright, who will never gain
the reputation of being over-opti-
mist, stated, “If we can’t beat
Clemson, I don't know whether we
can beat anybody.” However, clos-
ing with a more encouraging word
and emphasizing that the team had
shown a willingness to work hard,
he noted, “If hard work in’ the
right direction results in improve-
ment, we'll improve.”

Joe Dudley now leads the
Wildcats in scoring after six
games with 109 points and a
sparkling 18.1 average. Jerry
King is close behind with 101
and a 17.point average.

Miller also had words of praise
for the “team of the future,” Coach
Tom Fetzer’s JV's. Although drop-

gave the State JV’s a much better

good ball for the JV’s.
