THE DAVIDSONIAN

Slants
Sports

By JOHN JOHNSON

Tennis coach Bill Lufler, who guided Davidson to its first
undefeated tennis season back in 1946, signed a five-year
contract this month with the Swedish Tennis Association for
$14,000 annually.

Lufler will be in charge of expanding the tennis
program in that country on a nation-wide basis.

He has been directing the University of Miami team since
1948 with a record of 127 matches won, one lost and one tied.
His current 71-match winning streak could be extended this
spring to break William & Mary’s all-time collegiate record of
86 straight.

NOT INTERESTED |

Lufler wanted to put the Wildcats on the Hurricane
schedule this year, but the local sports department was not)
interested.

Three more spring sports—baseball, golf, and tennis—|
begin workouts this week. With the advent of the golf season, |
heavily-worked Coach Tom Scott takes on another responsi-|
bility. He is currently filling the triple capacity of varsity
basketball coach, freshman basketball coach and athletic di-
rector. All this work falls in the period of scheduling and
basketball recruiting, too.

MONDAY AFTERNOON

Baseball officially begins on Monday afternoon, but new
Coach Tom Stevens will not be able to personally direct
practice until about March 12 because of spring football
practice.. Until that time Captain Donny McRee will super-
vise the workouts. Four pitchers—‘“Dee” Lide, Dave Page,
Allen Moore and Don Hendry—of last year’s squad have been
limbering up their arms for the past two weeks.

Since the diamond is being worked on and the back-
stop is down, the team will conduct early drills strictly on
fundamentals and exercises.

Ace first baseman Dyke Little will probably not get
to play this spring due to a knee operation scheduled for
that period. His vacancy may be filled by freshman
George Hart, formerly of Charlotte's Harding High.

Tennis practice also starts on Monday, but Coach Richard
McKee is not extending an open invitation to all hopefuls, at
least not at this time. Since he anticipates the return of all of
last year’s team, he will devote the drill time to intense work

non-conference division.

Pete Ashcraft and Al Elder won
three firsts between them, and
Bill Gramley, Scott Woodmansee,
Ross Mallory, and the mile relay
team. also placed among the lead-
ers.
Ashcraft, who could have
his best season this year, won
an easy victory in the 880
yard run, clocking 2:02.5, and
came back in the mile race to
defeat Conley of Florida
State by a narrow margin,

turning in a 4:33.2.

He had the race under full con-
trol, although winning by only
one tenth of a second.

Al Elder, the versatile Rich-

Dick Weeks

ing tilts of the season to provide
Wildcat fans with some thrilling
fare on several occasions. One of
the key men in this late season
splurge has been captain Dick
Weeks, who ,has performed ad-
mirably in leading the ‘Cats.

The 5’ 9” guard from Savannah,
Ga., has long been a familiar sight
to Davidson partisans, splitting
the nets from the outside with
his high arching set shot. This
year, his third as a starter, he has
combined this weapon with a
jumping one hand push shot.

AGAINST CITADEL

Perhaps no finer example of
his value to the team can be
cited than his recent performance
against The Citadel. In the nar-
row 60-57 Davidson win, Weeks
pumped in 24 points to pace
lthe locals’ offense, in- addition to
playing an alert defensive game.

In the

closing seconds his
clutch shooting from the free
|throw line added the finishing
touches to a great performance
jand boosted his mates into the
|winner’s circle.

| Dick, majoring in history with
|his eye on a coaching career, was

Cobb and Ray Harding, with a

Sigma Chi’s Close In
With only three rounds of in-

| Sigma Chi’s are apparently well
on their way to the championship.

Although three teams, the

| their shot at the Sigma Chi's and

|the leaders.

Next week the Betas and ATO’s
|elash, with the losers dropping
into third place. Both teams have
succeeded in downing the Kappa
Sigs, which is the only team the
league leading Sigma Chi's have
failed to beat so far.

Sharing fifth place, at the mo-
ment, are the Phi Delts, SAE’s, and
