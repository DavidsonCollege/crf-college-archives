MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1993

First off, we got overwhelm-
ingly positive responses—and even
aletter— to ourarticles on interra-
cial dating. We wouldlike to thank

“everyone for their comments and
support. It’s nice to know that
someone oiat there is breathing.

We decided to take a break
from the normal routine this week
and discuss men and women at
Davidson, Dom"t worry, we'll re-
turn to our normal berating of ev-
eryone about racism next week.

Few peopllé at Davidson have
productive and healthy relation-
ships. Those tlaatdoare the excep-
tion rather than the mule. This is
due, atleast partially, to two things:
the way Davidson men and women
expect each other to act, and lack
of self-esteem-

Let’s take, for example, the
double standards that men here
(and society mn gemeral) set for
women. Ifaguy goes eden hook-

ing with lots of girls he’s consid:
ereda stud and gets respect, but a
girl who does the same thing is
considered a slut. We don’t want
to speak out against hooking,
‘We’re certainly not moral ex:
amples tothe campus, and it’s re-
ally noneofour business who wants
to procreate and who doesn’t.
Whatwe do want to speak ou!

-agaimst is the way people think
“about hooking. What bothers usis

the fact that guys who hook fre-
quently are thought of as cool, and
girlswho doare thought ofas sluts,
If people want to hook, it’s not our
dutytostopthem. But let’s lookat
it for what it is. Too many people

-here look at it for what it is not: 2

because a guy hooks with girls
doesn’t make him cool. On the
same note, just because a girl hooks
with guys doesn’t make her any

Defending Bad Habits

OK, everyone.

Clear your mind of everything
that your mamma said was bad
manners. You have been ruth-
lessly socialized ,amd need to fight

I want to bring so-called bad
habits into the Mimetight. I’m tired
of having to restrain myself when-
ever I really need todo something
that isn’t socially acceptable.

Take nose picking, for in-

the same rules togirls thal we do to

Butthe rules weapply to guys
are wrong. We can think of few
things more shallow than judging
the quality of a guy by the number

illusionis reinforced byback-slap-,

about the way Davidson men treat

Davidson women need to look

among their own gender (and, in
some cases, in the mirror) to find
some of the reasons why guys act
this way. We’re not talking about
serious cases like rape or abuse.

Nor are we suggesting that this is

the only reason guys act this way
(it’s not). All we're saying is that
when guys act in a certain way to
fill acertain image, and thataction
receives positive reimforcement,
guys respond (like Pavlov’s dog)

by repeating the action.

A lotof this is due to lack of
self-esteem. People who can’trely
on thernselves for support look to
others forit, and these others often
have no self-esteem, either. If you
think that people who move into
the 24-hour room the day after
freshman orientation, only to

emerge with a pale green tint and_

sunken eyes on May -14 are the
only ones with mo self-esteem, think
again. People who look like the
biggeststudsomcampusoften have
little self-esteem. The stud image
is justthat, an image. It’s-an image
they create of themselves and one
they thinkthey must conform to in
order for people to like them.
When thisenters into relation-
ships between men and women, it
is anything buthealthy. People are
afraid of being themselves, because
if they don’t live up to the image,
others will stop liking them. Butif

Double Standard

you can’t be yourself around your
boyfriend or girlfriend, when can
you be yourself?

People at Davidson need to
crack the illusion of the impor-
tance of the stud image. It’s fine
for people to drink entire kegs at
one sitting, dip in their sleep and
hook with ten people anda Trustee
in one evening, if they do it for no
other reason than because they want
to.

Butto do anything, especially
to hook with someone, to. bolster
yourown image and convince your-
self and others that you’ re cool, is
shallow and manipulative. On the
same token; we can’t look at girls
who hook as frequently as many
guys claim to as sluts, This re-
duces them to objects with func- ‘
tions. Let’s look at peopleas people
and judge each other for what we
are, not what petty images we live
up to.

Don't Forget Your Mittens

By Sean Lind

I was reading Robert
Fulghum on the toiled the other
day, and I guess his neat-o
allegory-ish style must have
mbbed off.

I never dress right for the
weather.

When I wake up, J Jook out the
window and see the day and judge
from that: A cloudless blue day
with sunshine. OA good. 7 il wear
4 t-shirt.

I walk outside and it’s like
“Antarctica - that crisp cold that
makes your nipples so hard you
think they'll tear your shit.

Ormaybe it’scloudyand rain-
ing. So I bundle up and walk
outside. And it’s like monsoon
season in the tropics, Every pore
in my body opens at omce and
begins to sweat.

The thing is, I hardly ever go
back inside and change. Maybe

~ I'm stubborn or just plain stupid,
but I usually stick with what I’ve -

got-on.

I don’t listen to weather re-
portseither. Meteorologists are on
the same level aspalmreaders and
economists. (Remember last
week’s “snow” fiasco? - Thesky is
Fays!! The sky is falling?!)

I have the same problem with

people as I have with the weather.
I look at them, try to gauge: the
climate, and prepare myself only
torealize “Oops, smart guy, you’ ve
done itagain.” From comfortable
and confident to icy cold in one
easy step.

When [ was a junior in high
school, laskedagirl friend of mine
to homecoming. Because it was
high school, I think I asked her
about 3 months in advance.

Well,imtheinterim period be-
tween the asking and the date, this
friendof mine started seeing some-

one. No problem,| thought, /’Il let-

her go with him. We talked about
it, but she imsisted that she and 1
go. I had asked her first; I was her
“pal” and she could talk to me and
feel comfortable. Or something
along those lines.

So it’s themight of homecom-
ing and I’m dressed tokill. AsI’m

driving to pick her up, it starts ©
raining. Great. I, of course, have «

no umbrella.

I get to her house, jog to the
front door. Ring. Her father an-
swers. “Is Sue in?” Her father
looks confused. “‘Why no, son. I
believeshe leftto goto dinner with
another fella.” “Thank you,” I
said.

It started to rain harder. I

stood there stunned, holding the
corsage, which was enjoying the
watering. I sat on the hood of my
car for a while after that as the
sprinkle becamea downpour, won-
dering what the hell went wrong.

_ The rain wet my hair, which
had been drying from the shower I
had taken about 30 minutes before,
and began to soak throughmy wool
sportcoat.

I remember thinking that I
smelled oddly like-a freshly sham-
pooed sheep.

I caught up with Sueat school.
on Monday. We talked. She said
I was too close a friend, her
“soulmate,” and she didn’t want to

_ Screw it up with sex.

I said I had no idea sex was
mandatory on a\homecoming date,
t that I was glad she thought so
uch-of me, especially in com-
ison with the meathead she was
ing. She tried to explain, but all
she could come up with were more
lame excuses.
So I shot her.
Just kidding. I didn’t shoot
her. I just turned up my collar and
braced myself, promising to be
more careful in the future.
Have anice day. Don’t forget
your mittens. It’s probably colder
out there than you think.
