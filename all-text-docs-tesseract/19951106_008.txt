David Aycock

as _ And the home of the Braves

OK. I’ve tried to deny it long
enough. After countless hours of
trying to convince myself that I
don’t really care, I can finally see
the futility of my labor. I will
admit it. I am a-Major League
Baseball fan. Why do] feel guilty

about admitting that? I know that .

last year’s player strike caused a
lot of problems for the game in
general. I mean they canceled the
World Series, which really pissed
off a lot of die hard baseball fans
‘like myself. But the point remains:
I am a junkie who finally has
enough guts to say that I still love
baseball. I love it so much that I
actually sat down to write this ar-
ticle.

There ‘is a point to this piece,
though. It is time that someone
wrote an article-that was not criti-
cal of the great American game,
lauding some of its greatest char-
acteristics instead. Namely, the
newly crowned World Champi-
ons, the Atlanta Braves. (Say this
to yourself before you continue

reading: “World Champion Atlanta
Braves.” Doesn’t it feel good?).
For lifelong fans of the South’s
only major pro baseball team, vic-
tory has never been sweeter... I
know that some of you probably
gconsider the Florida Marlins to be
southern, but they aren’t. They
play in Miami. Mi-

I literally grew up in Atlanta’s
Fulton County Stadium. Being
from western North Carolina, you
learn to love the Braves early, a
difficult task in. my youth since
100 loss seasons were accepted as
business as usual. In all the Braves
games I went to as a child (and I

your little brother.

Just suffering all these losing
seasons wasn’t enough, though.
Then, miraculously, the Braves got
to be good. In 1990, they finished
last in their division. In 1991, they
lost the World Series in seven
games to the Minnesota Twins. It
hurt to lose, but hey,

ami is not part of the
South. . Southern
Florida in general is
not the South. It is
merely New York City
on a very muggy day.
However, I digress.
Quite a few
people have accused
me of being a band-

Basically, what we have here is the
oppotunity for Braves fans and
Southerners in general to bask in
the glow of victory for the first
time since Fredericksburg ...

the Braves were
good! Thenthey went
to the series again n
‘92, only to lose in six
to Toronto. Istill have
problems accepting
the fact that a team

went to a lot), I think I saw them
win once, and that was against the
Houston Astros who were basi-
cally a minor league team anyway.
As bad as we were, they were
worse. It was almost like getting
beat up at school by the big kids
and then going home to pound on

work that way. In ‘93
the Braves lost the pennant to the
Phillies. In ‘94 the players and
owners took a break from playing
to count their money (I’m still a bit
bitter about that). But 1995 came
and saved the day. The Braves
played the Cleveland Indians in
the least politically correct sport-

ing event of all time, and the good
guys won their first championship
since the team played in Milwau-
kee and featured players like Hank
Aaron, Eddie Mathews, and War-
ren Spahn.

It was also the first major
sports title to ever be held south of
the fabled Mason-Dixon Line. I
guess you could say that the Super
Bowls won by the Cowboys count
inthis category, but I hate the Cow-
boys, and every person I have ever
met from Texas is a little sketchy
anyway (Casey and Stan Boyd toa
name a couple).

Basically, what we have here
is the opportunity for Braves fans
and Southerners in general to bask
in the glow of victory for the first
time since Fredericksburg,
Chancellorsville, and Monassas.
And although Jéfe really wants to
be Mexican, he is actually from
Atlanta, so I know he’ll run this.
Keep doin’ that Tomahawk Chop,
because the Atlanta Braves are
World Champs.

Rachael
“= to hate the library
Ever since I saw_ tion of air. It’s been a whole 30

“Ghostbusters” for the first time
libraries have given me the creeps,
but in my time at Davidson my fear
has evolved into outright animos-
ity. While my extended list of
grievances with the library could
fillimmense volumes, thereby pro-
viding hours of fun-filled reading,
I realize that Davidson students
have acornucopia of work to com-
plete. Therefore, I am providing
‘“Rachel’s Special Edition
Abridged List of Six Excellent
Reasons to Hate the Library” for
your reading enjoyment.
1)The Carpet- This one’s almost
too obvious to mention, but I can’t
help myself. I realize that E.H.
Little Library was designed and
built many a year ago, but come
on. Has that nasty, color-of-baby-
doo-doo carpet ever been stylish?
I don’t think so. I also realize that
building projects are expensive and
that costs must be cut wherever
possible, but I’m thinking that
maybe hiring a colorblind interior
decorator wasn’t such a great idea.
2)E-mail- I sit there with my nose
in a book, trying to look studious,
trying to ignore its call, but its
voice gets louder and louder: “log
on, Rachel. You know you don’t
want to study the role of anaerobic

decay bacteria in the denitrifica-

minutes since you last checked. -

Come on, Rachel. Just because
you didn’t have any new mail last
time doesn’t mean that 14 of your
best friends haven’t written you in
the last half hour.” How evil to put
such technology within spitting
distance of my carrel.
3)The Stairs- This is more a piece
of friendly advice than a means of
engendering malevolence: you
know those steps up to the second
floor that are to the right when you
walk in the front door? Well, be
careful when you walk up those
stairs because it would be really
embarrassing if you were to trip on
one of them and fall on your face
right in front of that big study group
posse that always sits on the floor
there. Not that I know this from
experience or anything, but... um
. . it just seems like that could be
a potentially embarrassing thing to
do.
4)The Basement (AKA...The
Quiet Floor)- I can understand
that, for some people, it is neces-
sary to have a silent place to study,
but this Quiet Floor business has
gotten a little out of hand. I mean,
you feel guilty for coughing down
there. Lighten-up, Quiet Floor
People. There’s more to life than
studying, after all. And besides,

when you gotta cough, you gotta
cough. |

5)The Closing-Time Bell- If
you’ve ever experienced it, you
know. If you haven’t, you will,
and all I can say is when you do, I
hope you don’t wet your britches.
6)The Bathrooms- Now, I don’t

know if you members of the male -

population here at Davidson will
be able to identify with this one or
not, for I have never ventured into
the library’s men’s room, butas for
the ladies’ room... What’s up with
the signs on the stall doors? To
clue in you blissfully ignorant fel-
lows—one of these little gems of
wisdom taped to the doors began,
“to whoever is throwing-up in this
bathroom... “ While I do realize
that bulimia is a serious illness,
that’s still just a little more infor-
mation than I needed. And what
about the one with the little ants
crawling around the border remind-
ing you to wash your hands? Give
me a break. “Hi. I’m still in
kindergarten. Will you wipe my
nose for me, too?”

If you need more reasons to
abhor Davidson, why not start by
reviewing this list daily? Feel free
to pencil in your own personal
reasons for hating the library and

remember—expressing disdain.

soothes the soul.

~The scarlet |

Recently I came upon a fasci-
nating realization concerning the
students at Davidson College.
Apparently, the burdensome intel-
lectual experience imposes a trau-
matic feeling on the consciences
of many. Accordingly, the popu-
lace has developed a lack of self-
confidence in their academic en-
deavors. Personal experience dic-
tates that a few Cs and Ds and Fs
don’t exactly hold the ingredients
for a likable disposition. Now, this
is a horrible thing—certainly a so-
lution must be contrived to save
those of us who are less fortunate
of the mind. Well, I’ve got a solu-
tion for everything, and this, of
course, is no exception. The heart
of all our troubles (as I have so
dutifully researched) dwells in the
grading system itself. Students at
Davidson are forced to use a scale
that discourages diligence and ap-
plauds occasional effort. Here,
then is my proposed amendment to
the grading scale:

A: A pretty good try
B: Basically a decent try
C: Captivating try

D: Damn good try
F: Fine try

As opposed to the present scale:
A: Alright, but you can do better
B: Betcha feel stupid, don’t you
C: Can’t do anything right
D: Don’t get upset, it’s only 35%
of your final grade
F: Find a tutor or embrace alcohol-
ism

I’msure my proposed changes
appear much more attractive. Sulk-
ing heads and dreary souls, eman-
cipated from self-pity and disgust,
will alter their gaits from gimp to
pimp, flaunting newfound accep-
tance and approval of their inher-
entintellectual abilities. The imple-
mentation of my suggested alter-
ation will ignite significant and
profound changes in student life.
Stress, bad tempers, and even sui-
cidal tendencies will reduce intime.
Everyone will be happy. However
far fetched this idea seems, it’s
time we downplay the significance
of grades and begin to stress the
importance of college as a learning
experience in general.
