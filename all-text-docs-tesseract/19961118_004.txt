Hess and Ross churn out second text

By Ann CuLp

Staff Writer

Sixteen years of class notes
created the second textbook in three
years by Davidson economics pro-
fessors Peter Hess and Clark Ross.
They say their latest book, entitled
Economic Development: Theories,
Evidence, and Policies, is a rever-
sal of the current tendency toward
diluting the content of textbooks.

“Unfortunately, there has been
a trend in the last two or three
decades to dumb down texts,” says
Hess.

“But we have a very high opin-

ion of students, and we think that
they deserve a rigorous and ana-
lytical text. We Delieve iat can
reach that standard.

“We need to present the ma-
terial in a concise, challenging
fashion and students will be en-
gaged by it,” says Hess.

The book offers an agenda
for global development including
greater cooperation among na-
tions, demilitarization, increased
attention to the environment, freer
trade, and more effective foreign
assistance.

Hess says, “The goal of study-
ing economic development is en-
lightened policy— what to do and

how to improve socioeconomic
conditions. That’s the excitement
of teaching economics.”

He and Ross describe the need
for sustainable development in
which present needs are met with-
out compromising the ability to
meet future needs.

Economic Developmentiscur-
rently being used in the course
called Economic Development
taught by Hess.

The earlier textbook, Prin-
ciples of Economics: An Analyti-
calApproach (West 1993) has been
used in several classes, including
Davidson’s Economics 101, since
its publication.

Health Center
hopes to Smoke
Out students

By ANDREW PRESTON

Davidson will hold its first

‘Great American Smoke Out on

Thursday, November 21, as a step
toward smoking awareness.

The smokeout will include the
chance for students and faculty to
measure their lung capacity and to
trade old packs of cigarettes for
bagels.

The event will be held from
9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Union
and Chamber Lobby.

Sponsors include the Ameri-
can Cancer Society, Iredell Me-
morial Hospital, the Pre-Medical
Society at Davidson College, and
Davidson College Health Educa-
tion.

Georgia Ringle, the coordina-
tor of the event and Student Health
Educator, says the Smoke Out is
important because “many students
start smoking in college due to the
stress, especially at a school like
Davidson, and aren’t able to quit
later.”

Ringle adds that although the
Smoke Outis only a one day aware-
ness event, the health office is avail-
able all year to help students who
want to quit smoking.

The Great American Smoke
Out was started twenty years ago
by the American Cancer Society.
It primarily attempts to spread
awareness in high school age stu-

‘dents, but also hopes to reduce

smoking in college students.

The Smoke Out’s goal is to
help lead smokers on the path to
quitting, since, as the Society points
out, “smoking is the most prevent-
able cause of death in our society.
Tobacco use is responsible for
nearly one in five deaths in the
United States.”

The Smoke Out doesn’t just
concern smokers, though.

Smokeless tobacco and sec-
ondhand smoke are also major con-
cems.

According toa 1986 statement
by the Surgeon General, smoke-
less tobacco “is not a safe substi-
tute for smoking. ..itcan cause can-
cer and nicotine addiction.”

Secondhand. smoke also has
serious consequences. According
to the American Cancer Society,
lung cancer from secondhand
smoke kills 3,000 people every
year.

Secondhand smoke contains
essentially all the carcinogens and
toxic agents inhaled by smokers.
