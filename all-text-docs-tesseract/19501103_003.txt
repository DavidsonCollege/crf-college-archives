Wildcats Catch Keydets For Final Home Showing

Pete Whittle ‘was
a worried man Wednes-
day night, and his
brow furrows weren’t
planted with concern
over his cross country
team chances in Mon-
day’s State meet. Mr.
- Whittle's splendid in-
; tra-mural sports pro-
gram, after picking up
where it had left off at
the end of a banner
year last spring, was
bringing frowns as well
as furrows. Wednesday
night, Louis Owen was
in’ a hospital in Win-
ton-salem, Barnyard Thompson and Jim Carr wore their arms
in slings, big Ed Sutton was still limping. Fog Horne had a
healthy cut over his eye, and numerous others were nursing
minor hurts from the week’s wrath wrought on the field of
friendly strife.

Touch football, rivaled only by basketball for dominance
in the field of fraternity competition, was getting too rock-em
and soek-em for a lot of guys’ good. In short, touch football
was becoming tough football.

No tougher than usual, you remind us. True, but it is
becoming too much of a bad thing. One or two injuries now and
then were understandable and thus excusable, but the in-
firmary’s running low on band aids and the Greeks are getting
short on gladiators.

This year’s injuries have ranged from Owen’s possible
skull fracture to the dislocated shoulders, with chipped teeth,
broken hands, sore jaws, ete,, interspersed. The average college
coach would have grabbed a sponge instead of a erving towel.

Conceded: It is bad. We are against the injuries. What to
do about it? By Monday’s play you may be playing under a
different set-up. Don’t worry too much about rumor that you
won’t be playing at all. Whittle feels that this year’s schedule
will be completed, but some changes are definitely going to be
made.

‘‘When we started the season,’’ the intra-mural director
recalled, ‘‘I asked the sports managers what they thought about
switching from two-hand touch to one-hand tag. They wouldn’t
hear of it. The titles don’t impart too much difference in the
games, and actually the rules are just about the same. But two-
hand touch is bringing on a lot of these injuries—partiewlarly
shoulder injuries—that we wouldn't have with one-hand tag.
You can shove a lot harder and push a man to the ground a
lot easier with twohands than you ean with one.”’

An injection here on our part is that one hand would also
tend to make the teams take to the air more, getting away from
n running attack where rugged contact blocking is a pre-
requisite.

‘“‘Most of the schools,”’ Mr. Whittle continued, ‘‘are going
over to tag football, and they report that it is not quite so
rough. There is just so much spirit out there that vou ean’t hold
them down. They are actually ready to die, if necessary, for
dear old fraternity!

‘It has me worried, seriously. I tried to see Mr. Scott today,
but he was busy. Before (Monday I am going to have a meeting
with him and the sports managers to arrive at some decision on
the matter. I would be willing to make a change no matter how
slight or how sweeping, so long as it will prevent just one injury.

‘*We may have to play ‘sissy’ football if that’s what they
want to call it. And even that may not solve the problem.’’

There has been much talk batted around the last week
about cutting football from the intra-mural. program, replacing
it with volley ball from an already crowded spring schedule.
There has even been talk that the powers that be have already
spiked football’s future. That isn’t so. At least it wasn’t as we
went to press. To us, and the cat calls are coming, abolishment
of the game looks like the answer. Because:

1. Issuing equipment would only be the green light for
rougher stuff.

2. Limiting play to boys who have never been out at any
time for college football would still leave a loop hole for a lot

Wildcat of the Week: Johnny Guiton

By DICK ROPER

Add one scatback.

On the basts of a performance
that won't soon be forgotten by
Erskine College’s Flying Fleet, lit-
tle Johnny Guiton made a place all
his own in the select circle of ‘Cat
stars. Anyone who saw small John’s
brilliant running in last Saturday's
44.0 win will not dispute the fact
that he belongs right up there with
the rest of the Wildcats of Re-
known—Auburn Lambeth, C.  L.
Runyan, A. C. Gregg, Roy White,
et al.

The Fayetteville boy who weighs
every ounce of 150 pounds couldn't
be stopped as he tore through Er.

for a total of 69 yards in ten trips

Guiton came near scoring an-
other TD for the Cats late in the
fourth quarter when he scooped an
Erskine pass off his shoetops and
ran through the boys in Maroon
for more than fifty yards before
a longer-legged Erskine back over-
took him on the visitors 35. Al-

Kittens At Raleigh
For Tough Battle
'With Frosh Pack

Coach Boyd Raird this week
faced the unenviable task of pre-
paring his twice-beaten frosh grid-
ders for a game wich may possibly
be the toughest of the season. The
Wildkittens will meet an N. C.
State frosh team tonight which,
although it has won but a single
game, is being drummed by the
press as the most powerful in re-
cent years.

Kickoff ¢ime is 8:00 p. m. in
Raleigh's Riddick Stadium.

After the crushing 47.0 defeat
which the Kittens suffered at Fur-
man last Saturday, one could have
cut the gloom in their dressing
room with a knife. And, although
they may be able to turn the tables
with some breaks and improvement
of their attack, they will meet a
team heavily favored to trounce
them again tonight.

Coach Baird has not had much
time to work on improving his
club this week. The freshmen have
been working with the varsity in
preparation for the Cats’: contest
tomorrow afternoon with V M. L,
running the Virginians’ plays and
setting up the Keydets’ offenses in
full and dummy scrimmages.

The frosh coach has other trou.
bles, too. His starting fullback, Pres-
ton Whitfield, has been out of action
all week with a leg injury, and
Julian Weinberg, Nabby Armfield,
and Bob Patton have also been
sidelined with minor hurts. How-
ever, all of these boys are expect-
ed to see at least limited action in
tonight's contest.

In what little time the freshmen
have had to themselves, Coach
Baird has stvessed the potentiali-
ties of their passing attack. Four
boys have been working from the
1 quarterback slot and all have done
a little of the throwing. Hershel
Allen, Tim Gilley, Sid Cutts, and
Johnny Gray have shared that po-
sition

Sig Chi's, K-Sigs,
Betas Lead Chase

The intramural race was narrowed once more when the
KA’s were defented twice during the week. Three teams are
now tied for the lead. They are the Kappa Sigs, Betas and Sigma
Chis. However, it certainly cannot be said that these teams will
be first when the season end. There are far too many upsets
seored each week to attempt to pick a winner. The leaders still
haven't clashed so these contests will be awaited by everyone.

Phi Gams 6-Pikas 0

The Phi Gams and Pikas_ re-
mained in a scoreless deadlock un
until the last 45 seconds of play,
when Ed Chipman completed a long
pass to Wallace Abbott for a touch.
down, It was a hard fought game
in which the Phi Gams threatened
to score several times. For the Pikas
Grover Martin was outstanding,
both offensively and defensively.

Sigma Chi's 6-KA’s 0

The Sigma Chi's‘ scored one of
the most important of their seasons
victories, when they edged the KA’s
6-0. Their lone touchdown was
scored early in the game when they
blocked a KA punt. Johnny Kel-
ton then ran the ball over. Tt was
a close, hotly contested battle all
the way through. T. W. Aldred did
some fine passing while leroy Mims
did a fine job in the line for the
KA’s,

SAE's 12-SPE’'s 0
The SAE’s ‘had little trouble in

defeating the SPE’s in their game,;

the score being 12-0. As usual the
SAE’s relied on passing with Jay
Roberts doing the tossing. On: the
receiving end of the touchdown pas-
ses were Bruce Ballenger and
Monty Hill. Jimmy Miller and Jack
Wilson carried the SPE's through
the game with their outstanding
play.

Kappa Sigs 18-Pi Kapps 0

“Slimy” Sloan’s passing and the
line play of Seemore Simmons once
more carried the Kappa Sigs to
victory. Sloan passed for all 3
touchdowns, the receivers being
Williams, Spach and Torrence. The
injury of Jim Carr somewhat ham-
pered the Pi Kapps chances as he
was playing a fine game. Winston
Wright also looked good for the
Pi Kapps.

Betas 24.Pikas 0

The Beta attack was far too pow-
erful for the Pikas to stop and
they rolled to a comparatively easy
victory. Pika passes were being
constantly intercepted by the Betas,
which held down their attack. The
Betas looked very good on passes,
but the Pikas were able to fairly
well halt their running attack. The
victory was a costly one, however
to the Betas, due to the injury of
Louis Owen.

Sigma Chi’s 20-ATO’s 6

Although both teams lost several
Opportunities to score, the game
did show a number of fine plays
which resulted in TD's. For the
ATO's John Whitfield looked good
as a pass receiver. The Sigma Chi
passing attack was led again by
Tyler Berry. Johnny Kelton did
most of the receiving.

Phi Gams 6.SPE's 0
In the only overtime game so
far this season the Phi Gams were
able to eke out a close victory
over the SPE’s. The Phi Gams
scored their lone touchdown on a
long pass to Bill Christopher in the

closing mintes of the overtime per-
iod The regular game ended in a
22 first down tie. For the SPE’s
Horace Ball stood out as a passer
and “Chick” Howe as a receiver.
SAE’s 12-KA's 6

With the loss of Bill Bird from
their attack the KA‘’s were able
to do very little in their gaine with
the SAE's. The SAE line proved to
be the difference in the contest,
Both SAE touchdowns were on
passes by Jay Roberts. Monty Hilt
caught one touchdown pass while
Bob Bennett caught the other. The
KA’s scored on a pass to Bill
Adams.

Cats Swamp Erskine
In Best Offensive
Show of the Season

By DICK. LILES

The bot and cold Wildcats of
Davidson College turned “red hot”
Saturday night and = scuttled the
Flying Fleet from Due West by
44.0, as a whole slew of newcomers
ran their posts with perfection. It
was little Johnny Guiton who car-
tied the spark (and the ball) for
the spirited Cats by completely
Overwhelming the  awe-stricken
spectators with his classy show of
running and driving power.

Along with Guiton, Roy White
and C. L. Runyan also turned in
their best performances of the sea-
son. Roy showed the pep and fire
that won him acclaim as a frosh
star while picking up 116 yards in
17 hauls. Runyan produced ‘the’ io-
comotion that pile-drove the ball
for 109 yards. Runyan's display re-
minded everyone of the wonderful
showing against State last year.
It was this kind of power and
drive that averaged him better than
10 yards per try in the fray Satur-
day night.

Erskine put up a scrappy defense,
but wholly inadequate to the pound-
ing legs of White, Runyan, and
Guiton, nor to the flitting of passes
in thé air. Jack Ruth piloted the
“Whiz Kids” in the sinking of the
Fleet with the greatest of ease and
like the true skipper that he was
subbing for. While Lambeth sat
out the game with an injured and
sore hip, Ruth completed 4 out of
8 passes for 76 yards.

Bill Freeman continued his ruth-
less ways in the opposition’s back-
field by tearing into the Fleet's
ranks and rendering destruction to
the running game. Jim Fasul and
Jerry Kiser also were outstanding
in the forward wall on offense.
These boys played most of the
game and played exceptionally well.
Dave Williams also continued his
pass-snatching ways by sparkling
on offense, while “Sturdy” Oakes
tore ‘em open on defense in the
flank,

[Foes In Southern Conference Go
At Charlotte Tomorrow Afternoon

By CHARLIE HASSELL
Tomorrow afternoon, the Wildcats meet the Keydets of
V.M.I. on the turf of Charlotte’s Memorial Stadium in their
lust home game and the first in a series of three Southern Con-
ference games. The Cats will be seeking their first conference
win since their upset over North Carolina State last season.

Up to this game, Davidson has
met all five of its opponents on the
rebound. V. M. I. follows the rule,
having been defeated by an under-
dog Catawba last week, 14-13.

The Cats .go into tomorrow's
game practically at =o maximum
strength. Captain Auburn Lambeth
will return to the lineup as_ will
Jack Branch, who suffered only a
minor reinjury in the Erskine
game. Also joining the ranks for
the first time in several weeks will
be Big Bill McNeely. Jack Ruth
though tast week he played a game
that merited him “Wildcat of the
Week,” will be in better shape this
week. Only Henry Wilson, still out
with a broken wrist, is expected to
miss the scrap.

The brunt of the aerial offensive
will. probably rest on Lambeth and
his two principal receivers, Dave
Williams and Bob Turk. These
two ends have proved their abilities
as snaggers this year, gathering
in most of the 43 aerials Lambeth
has completed. C. L. Runyan ané
Ham Wade will also be taking reg-
ular cracks at the V. M. 1. forward
wall. A. C. Gregg, Roy White, and
speedy Johnny Guiton are being
counted on for heavy ground work.

All three of these. average better

than six yards per trv.

In spite of a poor record last
year and a tough slate this year,
Coach Tom Nugent is optimistic
about his V, M. I. players.

The Keydets boast the first Vir-
ginia tean’ to beat Willian and
Mary, their intra-state foe, since
1939; they gave the Indians a 25-
19 belting in their season opener.

Coach Ray Rrown, who has seen
the Keydets play their past two
games, . believes they Jost to Ca-
tawba last week because of a lack
of spirit. “They were just flat, like
we were against W. & 1... They'll
probably have it this week.” says
Brown. They gave the University of

Virginia a terrific battle! losing by |

13-26.
The Keydets have a_ host of
sophomore runners chief among

them being George Chumbley. The
running offense, however, is built
around Joe Stump, a 6° 2", 21 year
old senior from Norton, Virginia.
“Jumping Joe" ranks fourteenth in
the nation on yards gained rushing,
holding a net gain of 573 yards, as
of this week. Brown believes Stump
“is the best runner we'll play against
all year.” Another sparkplug in the
Keydet squad is quarterback Jimmy
Coley, eighteenth in. the land on
total offense. He has completed 39
out of 97 attempted passes for a
net gain of 592 yards. In the line,
the Cadets average 192 pounds on
offense, which gives them an edge
on the Cat wall.

Memorial stadium may see a
formation that is completely new
to it tomorrow afternoon. The V.
M. I. men use their coach's inven-
tion, the “I-T" formation. It is
merely a split T line with all the
backs aligned directly behind one
another straight back from the cen-
ter. From this formation, they shift
a great deal, moving into the con.
ventional T. The Keydets also em-
ploy a double wing formation,
sometimes split the ends, have a
man in motion, or put. flankers way
out.

WOODY LEACH

Offensively or defensively,
Woody Leach has proved his
worth as a back to be reckoned
with when a team runs into the

is a back-racking defensive ace,

It's State Meet
For Cats Monday

Riding high after a 38-19 win
over the University of Georgia last
Saturday, Coach Pete Whittle’s
varsity harriers will take to the
road again when they enter the
Big Five cross-country meet at
Raleigh Monday. The meet will be
run on the N C. State course.

The Cats will enter the meet
seeded not higher than fourth,
since they have lost to Duke, State,
and Carolina. They have not run
against the Wake Forest harriers
this season.

After the Big Five meet, the
Cats’ next contest will be a tri-
angle with Virginia and William
and Mary at Charlottesville, Va.,
on November 10. The season’s
closer will be with the State har-
riers at Raleigh on the 13th.

Coach Whittle’s club will go into
the Big Five meet with a 2-3 won-
lost record. Tom and Dick Stock.
ton, outstanding in every meet so
far this season, will carry the
Wildcats’ hopes for a State champ-
ionship, with Bill Lee and sopho-
more Bob Henry in close support.
