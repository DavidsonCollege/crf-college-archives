Friday, April 11, 1986. THE DAVIDSONIAN

Lady Cats come from behind to win tourney

By PAM HARMANN -°

Despite the unfortunate predi-
cament of NCAA Division III in-
eligibility, shattering hopes of
another Division III national
championship, the women’s ten-
nis team is proving its worth with
a 10-4 record and seven victories’
in the last seven matches. On
Tuesday, April 8, the Lady Cats
defeated Appalachian State Uni-
versity 6-3 and over the weekend
they won the Emory Invitational
Tournament in Atlanta, the sec-
ond year in a row.

The Second Annual Emory In-

vitational is an NCAA Division III -

tournament comprised of twelve
of the strongest teams along the
easter seaboard. This tourna-
ment provides a great deal of in-
formation to aid in evaluation for
NCAA bids. In winning this tour-
nament, Davidson proved itself as

the top Division III school in the
area.

In the quarterfinals, Davidson
had no trouble with Millsaps Col-
lege, winning 9-0. All the singles
matches were won easily in only
two sets each. The semi-finals
against Mary Washington College
proved a bit tougher, yet David-
son again came out on top 6-3.
The team won all the singles
matches without too much diffi-
culty, then dropped three straight
doubles matches. This was defi-
nitely a disappointment with the
team obviously looking ahead to
the evening’s matches knowing
they had already won this one.

The most exciting matches
were certainly against Emory Uni-
versity in the finals. Thirty mi-
nutes into singles play, sopho-
more Amy McNelis at number
one, senior captain Lolly Johnson

at number three, freshman Martha
Johnson at number five had each
dropped their first set. Freshman
Jane Price at number six was hav-
ing some problems as well. Thus
Davidson was starting off having
difficulty in four spots.

McNelis came back and won
2-6, 6-3, 6-0. Freshman Marion
Stone had no difficulty at number
two singles, winning 6-2, 6-1.
Johnson won 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. Junior
Debbie Podolin at number four
also won without difficulty 6-1, 6-
2. Finally, Price hung in to win 6-
4, 7-5. The number two doubles
team of Johnson and freshman
Alice Stubbs won 7-5, 6-1 and the
number three team of Podolin and
Johnson also won 6-3, 6-4.

The comeback enabled the
team to win the match 7-2, prov-
ing that Davidson has the ability to
win tough matches under pres-

sure. Coach Caroline Brown feels
that this match showed that this
year’s women’s tennis team is the
best Davidson has ever had.
According to Lolly Johnson,
“The tournament strengthened our
team. Not only were we all faced
with difficult matches, but the
tournament also brought us to-
gether ‘emotionally. When any
one team member was faced with
a difficult match, we would all
ban together on the side line to
provide emotional support.”

On Tuesday, the Lady Cats
defeated Appalachian State Uni-
versity 6-3 in their first Southern
Conference match of the season.
Davidson lost numbers one and
two singles and number one dou-
bles, revealing ASU’s strength at
the top of the ladder. The remain-
ing matches were easily won by
Davidson. Lolly Johnson won 6-

Men’s tennis serves exciting matches

Scientists say that heart at-
tacks are causd by high levels of
cholesteral, not enough exercise
avd poor eating habits. Not at
1 avidson. At Davidson, heart at-
tacks occur while watching the
men’s tennis team play. And un-
like most heart attacks, these
heart-stoppers leave you begging
for more. Winning two and losing
two, Davidson's men’s tennis
team has played exciting tennis
this past week, bringing their re-
cord to 14-7.

The Cats did not start their
week with heart-stopping tennis;
they began by blowing away The
Citadel 9-0 in their Southern Con-
ference opener. They followed
this with another easy victory over
UNCC. winning 8-1. Junior
Hayes Dallas gave spectators a
hint of the gutsy tennis to come in
his -ree set loss.

luesday, psyched up by coach
Jeff Frank's showing of Rambo,
the Wildcats proceded to give
Wake Forest a scare. Although
Wake Forest is not the tennis pow-
erhouse that UNC is, they are a
strong team; several of their
players have experience playing
in Europe. Davidson lost the
match 7-2, but played very well.

Rain delayed the Cats start and
consequently one singles match
was played indoors while the rest
were held on the outdoor hard
courts — a faster surface than the
clay Davidson normally plays on.

Sophomore Jim Thompson
played tough his first set after fal-
ling behind two games to John
Vincent, a power tennis player.
Thompson won the third game,
lost the fourth, won the fifth by
serving spectacularly (his final
serve in the fifth game was an
ace), split the next two games,
broke Vincent's serve to pull even
at 4-4, was broken back in the next

game, and lost the set 6-4 in the
next game. After the first set, Vin-
cent’s overpowering serves and
quick play at the net were too
much for Thompson. He lost 6-1.

Meanwhile, outdoors David-
son was putting the fear of God
into. Wake Forest. Freshman
Sebastian Koch and sophomore
Bill Young both won easily, both
winning 6-1, 6-2. Junior Michael
Meyer lost to Wake’s usual
number one player (playing at the
fifth position because of an injury)
6-1, 6-3. Senior Craig Hall, after
dropping the first set 6-2, pulled
back into the match, leading in the
second set 5-2 before losing that
set 7-6.

The real heartbreaker in this
match occurred at Davidson's
number two position. Dallas won
his first set against his opponent 7-
5. He kept playing tough in the
second set, at times causing his
opponent, Stefan Dallwitz, to
scream in frustration and disbelief
at the sweet shots Dallas hit.
Dallwitz was not prepared to roll
over and die, however. He over-
came Dallas’ superb net play to
win the second set 7-6 (7-4 in the
tiebreaker). The match then
moved indoors because of dark-
ness. Inside, Dallas continued to
play well, but Dallwitz toughened
up mentally and won the third set
6-3.

Davidson needed to sweep the
doubles’ matches to beat Wake
Forest and although they did not
do it, they certainly tried. Junior
Trip Caldwell teamed with
Thompson at the number two
spot, combining aces with sharp
returns to almost upset the Wake
team. They lost 6-4, 7-6 (7-5 in
the tiebreaker.) Hall and Meyer
played another thrilling match at
the number three position, even
though they lost 6-4, 7-5. The
number one doubles was stopped
after the first set because Wake

Forest had already won the match.

Wednesday, Davidson hosted
Appalachian State University.
Appalachian is 4-1 in the Southern
Confernece and although repu-
tedly not strong down the line,
they looked it on Wednesday,
beating Davidson 5-4. Davidson
and ASU split the — singles
matches. The Wildcats won easily
at numbers three, five and six.
Young beat his man 6-2, 6-4,
while Meyer won his first set
quickly 6-0 and proceded to drag
out the second set before putting it
away 6-4. Koch looked strong,
beating his opponent 6-1, 6-2 with
blistering forehands and burning
serves.

Thompson played a gutsy first

set, losing 7-5 to an opponent

whose serve and volley game was
‘“‘He-man” strong. He dropped the
second set 6-2. Dallas lost his
match 6-3, 6-0; he looked tired
and was bothered by a sore elbow.
Sophomre Carlos Ortega substi-
tuted at the number four spot for
Hall, who was out with a shoulder
injured in the Wake Forest match.
Ortega fought through a tough
first set, losing 7-5, before losing
the second 6-0.

In doubles, Young and Dallas
were overpowered by the ASU
team and lost 6-4, 6-3. Davidson
had to win both of the remaining
doubles matches to eke out a vic-
tory over the Mountaineers.

Meyer and Koch won the first
match of doubles 6-4, 6-4.
Caldwell and Thompson led the

.3, 6-0, Podolin won 6-2, 6-1,

Martha Johnson won 6-1, 6-0 and
Price won 6-1, 6-1. The number
two doubles team of L. Johnson/
Stubbs won 6-1, 6-2 and the
number threeiteam of Podolin/M.
Johnson won 6-0, 6-0.

The women’s tennis team now
hopes to be able to go to the South-
em Conference Championship.
They will try to get ineven though

- they play only two other Southern

Conference teams. They. hope to
be able to compete here since they
are unable to go to the Division III
National Championship. The
Lady Cats are looking forward to
the match at Furman University
next Wednesday, April 15, be-
cause Furman leads the Southern
Conference. This match will be a
real challenge and will show how
competitive the Lady Cats can ex-

pect to be in the Southern Confer-
ence.

other set 6-3, 5-4. At this point the
ASU players picked up their play
and tied the second set at 5-5 and
then pulled ahead 6-5. Caldwell
and Thompson held service and
forced the set into a tiebreaker.
The two teams traded points in the
tiebreaker before Davidson fal-
tered, losing 7-5. The third set
was also close. The Cats took a 5-
4 lead because of the superb serv-
ing of Caldwell and the fine net
play of both. Davidson had one
match point, but could not pull it
out. They lost the match 6-3, 6-7
(7-5), 5-7.

The Wildcats play several
conference matches away this
weekend, playing ETSU, VMI
and Western Carolina. Their next
home match is Monday against
Pfeiffer College at 2 p.m.
