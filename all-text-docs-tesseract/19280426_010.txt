Somewhat timidly, yet hopefully, the
aspiring freshman approached the editor
of the “Cham” and submitted his contri-
bution. “Are you quite sure this is an
original story?” asked the editor.

“Yes indeed,” replied the fresh, “all ex-
cept the punctuation—I changed that in
places.”

Julius Caesar killed in

(Special to The Davidsonian)
Rome, April 26—Julius Caesar was night
clerk at the Coliseum. His Girl Friend,
Desdemona, was a telephone operator over
at the Tower of Pisa. Things looked pretty
bright for Julius until Brutus, the villain,

came into his life. Now Brutus, being a radio
announcer, would stop at nothing, and fre-
quently did. He determiried to win Desde-
mona by fair means or foul, preferably foul.
Enmity grew between the two until the

Cynicism Versus Romance

When Junior speaking comes the thoughts
of Mr. Joe Davidson lightly turns to
thoughts of love and also of house parties.

The date of the house party settled, the next
problem is to choose the right girl to grace
the campus with Joe, himself, as her escort.
With girl problem aside, the next move of
the student’s mind is to wander out upon the
campus, with the main center of revolution
being about the china-berry tree.

In the past the chief center of romanticism
on the campus is the china-berry tree, and it
seems likely to revolve about this famous

breaking point was inevitably on hand.
Here’s where Desmonda comes into the
story. Her alert womanly brain told her

j that the proper thing for her to do was to

bring the rivals together and try to make
peace. She invited them to call at her house
on the same evening at the same time. She
stopped at Othello’s Bakery on the way home
and purchased three lovely doughnuts. The
boys arrived at her home at the appointed
hour. J. Caesar was unmistakably nervous.
He saw the doughnuts on the table and ate
one of them to quell his nervousness. Des-
demona shyly nibbled at one of them and
tried to make conversation. Now Othello
slung a mean piece of dough—his doughnui.
were irresistible. J. Caesar loosened his
girdle and reached for the last one. Brutus
watched him with the cunning of a fox un-

'|til he finished. Then he charged, “Julius

Quintus Pubius Caesar, how many of. them
doughnuts did you eat?” Julius rose to his
feet and replied: “Et tu, Brutus!” The
lights went out and when the gendarmes ar-
rived it was morning.

figure until cruel time and weather removes
this figurehead from our midst. It has been
contended by some of the campus cynics that
no one frequents the china-berry tree any
way, that the whole»tradition is a fable un-
based upon fact. This seems wrong—there
are at least three or four facts that bear di-
rectly upon the use of the china-berry tree
as a trysting place. Exhibit Number One.
Last year after the Junior Speaking week-
end, one of the Juniors got up in chapel to
announce the following: “Lost, somewhere
between the China-berry tree and the X. X.
X. house, one X. X. X. fraternity pin.”
Exhibit Number Two. Although this is
purely circumstantial, it seems to bear
weight, recently, and you will notice just be-
fore a house party, the china-berry tree was
wired off from the rest of the campus. What
was the purpose of this, it is left to your
imagination and judgment. Exhibit Number
Three. So potent is the compelling force
of the tree that the following tale js told by
the alumni as regards this center of life.
That one night a young and bashful profes-
sor even went so far as to take his lady fair
and show her the tree when the moon had
risen and the powers of Cupid were at their
strongest. Exhibit Four. During the sum-
mer, when summer conferences are in vogue,

much complaint has been registered, caused
by the breaking limbs when the too amorous
and ambitious ladies climbed up in the tree.
Cause untold, but left to the imagination.

Now will the campus cynic hush. As re-
ported by Uncle Dinwiddie.
