to morning and afternoon sessions for

cies of the organization discussed, and
plans were made for the future. In ad-
dition to this an election was held which
resulted in the seletcion of Dr. W. M.
Brown, of Washington and‘ Lee Uni-
versity, as president. The retiring presi-
dent was Dr. John C. French, of Johns-
Hopkins.

The night session was given over toa
banquet, with the University of Pitts-
hurg Circle as host. An especially en-
joyable time was passed by all, because
of the courtesy and hospitality of the
Gamma Circle.

The purposes of the O. D. K. fratern-
ities are to honor those men who have
been of service to their respective stu-
dent bodies and colleges and to do con-
structive work at the institutions at
which! they are located. The organiza-
tion was founded at Washington and Lee
in 1914 and now embraces seven colleges
and universities: W. and L., Johns -Hop-
kins, U. of Pitt., Davidson, U. of Rich-
mond, Centre, and William and Mary.
