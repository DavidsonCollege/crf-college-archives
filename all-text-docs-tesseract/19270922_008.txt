campus singing. By using traditional David-
son songs, fraternity songs and popular col-
lege melodies he hopes to make it one of the
most popular pastimes on the campus. How
about on Home-Coming Day when the battle
is over a “college song” around the columns
of Old Chambers. The practice will not be
confined to Home-Coming Day but will be
encouraged all during\ the year.

If you are careless of your influences
you are careless of your character.

| “Y” Column

Having gotten off to a good start this
year, the Y will continue to bring. the
best available speakers to Davidson, and
following this idea will have for the lead-
er next Sunday Col. Kirkpatrick, Presi-
dent of the Charlotte Chamber of Com-
merce. This prominent lawyer has al-
ways been a very loyal supporter of the

college, and is a man who will bring a}

practical message. He is one of Char-
lotte’s leading business men and will have
a talk that ought to be of a great interest
to all the student body. Remember the
time and place—6:15, Shearer.

AP Scah Ae Tees:

The Y is enlarging its. field of work
constantly, and-most- especially in Sun-
day School activity around Davidson and
nearby vicinities, Those who are inter-
ested in work of that sort are asked to
see Leo Pritchett, Cabinet member who
is. in charge of Sunday Schools. In a
like manner, another phase of work has
steadily grown, and anyone who would
like to get into.Boys’ Work of any sort
is asked to see John Melton, in charge
of that particular activity.

pELDGEN, | acaath

The Y feels fortunate in being able to
announce that during the fall both O.
Max Gardner, of Shelby, and Bishop
Penick, of Charlotte, will be here as
speakers. These men are -both very
well-known and are leaders in their
chosen work. More specific notice will
be made later, }
ce

A part of the Y. M. C. A. that is given
very little thought by students in general is
that of World Evangelism, We have a
living example of the great work that is
being done on that direction in the case
of the Hangchow Fund, which is used in
the advancement of the Master’s work
far across the world. It is a credit to
Davidson that we are doing our part in
world evangelism, but there still is a
great field left for valuable work along
that line.

The Y is starting a class, to be con-
ducted by Prof. Cullum, for all those
who are interested in leading singing in
any sort of welfare clubs or organiza-
tions, as boys’ clubs, evangelistic meet-
ings, etc. In connection with this the Y
is sponsoring a Y quartet, which will be
used for special music at Vesper services,
and will also be sent on various deputa-
tions. This is just one of the new fea-
tures the Y has added to better perform
its work,

An extensive trip is being planned for the
Glee Club to take later in the year. As last
year, this trip will include stops at many of
the North Carolina schools and cities, as
well as several Virginia cities. Professor
Cullum plans to introduce several new num-
bers this year and to train the club on slight-
ly different lines from those which have for-
merly been followed. Some of the numbers
he plans for the club to work on are: Some
Twelfth and Seventeenth Century Hymns,
They include the “Crucifix” of Alotti, taken
from the famous Nicene Creed (A. D. 225),
an arrangement of the Twenty-Third Psalm
by Schubert, “Ave Maria,” as taken from the
Repertoire Chanteurs di Saint Gervais, “The
Brownies,” ‘by Leoni, “The Sheriff of Not-
tingham Song,” by DeKoven (taken from the
famous DeKoven opera “Robin Hood”).
These and others will form the large number
of compositions upon which the club will
direct their work and study. Professor Cul-
lum has already formed a practice schedule
and hopes to have the Glee Club in shape for
a public appearance during the fall.

This is the first year in which Davidson
has had a director who has been here at Da-
vidson and devoted all of his time to the
work of the Glee Club. In addition to this
work, the R. O. T. C. is also under the direc-
tion of Professor Cullum. Professor Culltm
is well known in. North Carolina and has
been invited to speak before the North Caro-
lina State Teachers’ Association at the an-
nual meeting on the 15th of October, in
Asheville, N. C,

The whole student body, more espe-
cially the old men, were glad to see for a
few days Bill Covington and Bill Chris-
tian. These two were very prominent
on the campus and were actively en-
gaged in Y work. Covington was for
two years a Cabinet member in charge
of personnel, and also vice-president of
the Y. Christian was a Cabinet member
for one year in charge of attendance, and
his last year was president of the Y. The
Y was very glad to see these men agairi,
for they did a great work while here, and

IDEAL MODERN COLLEGE

(Continued from page one)

| leges and the college man as formed in mod-
lern novels and newspapers. He then stated
that he does not wish to criticize the average
college but to analyze it to see what it of-
fers the individual for future enjoyment of
| life.

Dr. Mims sounded a warning against ex-
treme specialization, that it might not take
the place of a training of an appreciation of
all phases of life while one is preparing him-
self for the future. Among men who are
| considered eminently successful by the world
such as Henry Ford, Rockefeller, Darwin,
Charles Spurgeon, Wm. J. Bryan, and others
who have devoted every ounce of their en-
ergy to the development of one phase of their
life, there is a distinct loss of the appreciation
of things that make life more interesting, in-
vigorating, and livable. On the other. hand,
men like Pasteur, Martin Luther, John Wes-
ley, Thomas Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Wood-
row Wilson, who have been intensely inter-
ested in their business but who have learned
to. enjoy the artistic in life, always find new
thrills and pleasures in their associations with
fine things, and stay spiritually young until
their death:

An ideal education in a college of liberal
arts has two fundamental results, he said.
The first, the power to think rightly, is the
primary end of all culture. Independent
thinking is the glory and power of the col-
legiate world, however, there are dangers in
the failure to discriminate between the ex-
tremes in lines of thought. To learn to
swing from one extreme without going to the
other is a fair test of whether or not a man’s
education has given him the power to think
rightly. Specialization hinders somewhat
proper thinking in that it destroys our per-
spective, making us see all things in the light
of one, rather than one thing in the light of
all.

The second result of an ideal education is
the development of a love of beauty. Love
of beauty is not an aesthetic glow, but it must
be developed, and to fail to do this is to sig-
nally fail in life. It is a man’s religious duty
to develop his sense of the beautiful. Life is
more than body, raiment, and food. It is the
proper use and enjoyment of all those things
with which God has endowed the human
spirit.

In conclusion, Dr. Mims quoted Wilson
again as he said that English literature is the
birthright of every man and woman who
speaks the language of Shakespeare, and he
who fails to use it, and enjoy it, is missing
one of his richest heritages.

Dr. E. F. Shewmake, chairman of the
faculty committee on public lectures, an-
nounced that the next lecture will be offered
on October 12th. The speaker will be Dr.
M. H. H. Joachim, an eminent authority .pf
India, who will deliver one of his many in-
teresting lectures on that great unknown
country. Dr. Joachim has been studying con-
ditions there for many years and his lecture
should prove profitable to all those who wish
to take advantage of his coming.

prayer meeting on the top floor of one of the

austere dormitories, which was conducted,
ithe prayer meeting and not the dormitory, by
the Privy Council of the Royal Order of
Highn’mity Oatfeeling Sophomores.

From this meeting he emerged much sad-
der and very much wiser, with an enlarged
group of acquaintances. Among the latter
were those whose names were strangely
familiar, yet forbidden because of their un-
usual motivation to paddle-provoking activi-
ties. He located his habitat, and purchased
his laundry ticket and chapel seat. He re-
fused to buy radiator privileges because,’ as
he said to the solesman, he had been used to
rising and attiring himsef in the most rig-
orous temperature without discomfort.

Under the patronizing guidance of Only-
a mere Junior, he was conducted about the
quadrangle, familiarizing himself with the
locations of the important class. buildings,
laboratories, drinking fountains and avenues
of escape. He showed great interest in the
tiled swimming pool in the basement of
Watts dormitory, and inspected with genuine
admiration the quaintly designed individual
boxes at the local mail distribution depot.

When the stately trees began to cast their
shadows eastward, and the deepening twilight
spread a mantle of oblivion over the familiar
landmarks of the grounds, he followed the
example of the domestic fowls, and betook
himself to his lofty roost, and there, on the
downy bosom of the magnificent old four-
poster, he sank into a tranquil slumber, while
the subtle beams of a waning moon cast
grotesque shadows over his recumbent form.
Mr. Average Frosh was acclimated, thor-
oughly orientated, and at home.
