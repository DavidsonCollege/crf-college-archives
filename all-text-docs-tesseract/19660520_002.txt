An Evaluation

The year, for all practical pur-
oses, is over. In light of a proposal
y Dean of Students Richard C. Burts,

calling for a reorganization of student
government, we are prompted to ex-
amine the Student Council’s role in
influencing campus policies during
the past year.

There were two major issues this
year which the Council could have
strongly asserted its leadership: the
abolition of Vespers and changes in
the structure of the Honor System
and Student Body Regulations. Yet
the Council contributed little more
than docile “endorsements” of plans
submitted by other campus organiza-
tions.

In the Vespers question, student
opinion played a major part in de-
liberations by the faculty’s Religious
Life Committee, the Trustees and the
faculty. But the student opinions were
those of a small number of concerned
students, not student-elected repre.
sentatives.

The same can be said of the alter-
ations in the Student Body Regula-
tions: The changes came out of study
and work by several individual mem-
bers of the Honor Court. The Coun-
cil’s main claim to fame in the issue
was its two aborted attempts at refer-
dums that ended up in the trash can.

Both issues are significant, and

while the ultimate results will not be.

known for several years, the student
body deserved to be represented. The
Council exists for no other reason.
We believe that the changes.made this
year are good, but they were made
without the Council’s explaining or
representing the student point of
view. ,

In September the Council passed a
platform of 16 goals. compiled from
a number of planks from candidates’
platforms issued in the spring. Sev-
eral of the ideas, such as changes in

Grow Up

It’s always been a college tradition,
and deservedly so, we think, that
freshmen should prove to be the most
immature class. It’s just come to be
expected. And they have gone a long
wav towards proving it recently, with
their water bombs which make it im-
possible to walk within 30 feet of a
freshman dorm without keeping an
upward eye.

But the residents of Belk have out-
done even the freshman pranksters.
The water bombs are admittedly a
nuisance, but they don’t begin to com-

On Lectures

Burns and Mead have come and
gone, and with them the 1965-66
Reynolds Lectureship. While none
would argue that both of this year’s
speakers were a compliment to the
program, the administration and plan-
ning have left something to be desired.

Since the program was instituted in
1960, there has been an average of
more than three speakers a year, This
year there were two, both ill-timed
to fit into the college calendar.

Eight months went by without a
Reynolds Lecturer, and then within
two weeks, less than a month before
exams, both James MacGregor Burns
and Margaret Mead were here. Such
late visits would obviously not draw
crowds as easily as would a mid- or
early-semester visit, when there was
less activity to interfere.

Their visits would have also been
much better received had they been
better spaced and given more pub-

Vespers and additional dorm phones,
were implemented, but with no help
from the Council.

The only plank carried out suc-
cessfully was that calling for a re-
duced number of chapels by reducing
the number of Monday chapels, a feat
accomplished by simply doing nothing,
since the Council is responsible for
supplying speakers on that day.

The most promising idea was that
of establishing a course evaluation
program, an idea that has been dis-
cussed for years. But in the eight
months since the platform was
adopted, the Council has not taken the
first concrete step towards accom-
plishing this goal.

We could go on, commenting on
each of the other individual failures.
But hopefully the examples cited al-
ready will point up the need for a
more effective and potent Student
Council.

We think Dean Burts’ “campus gov-
ernment” plan has promise for such
effectiveness. Rather than having 15
students voting on all matters, with
no intimate knowledge of the issues
presented, there would be joint fac-
ulty-student committees with students
eligible to vote on matters of policy,
much like the present arrangement
of the Faculty Religious Life Com-
mittee, on which three students sit
and vote.

Such a structure would allow stu-
dents to become familiar with the par-
ticulars of a particular area of college
life, rather than being expected to
be conversant with policy matters in
general. The new system could also
serve to bring the faculty’s procedures
into line with recommendations of the
Self-Study, with its call for more com-
mittee action and less deliberation by
the faculty as a 75-to-80 member
body.

pare with the spectacle of cherry
bombs being catapulted from Belk
towards Cannon dorm.

With the window screen in the
freshman dorm gone (it makes for
easier water throwing). the coast is
clear for one of the firecrackers to
sai] into Cannon in the midst of the
taunting freshmen, with the possibil-
ity of serious injury or worse. .

Come on, sophomores (and juniors
and seniors), we expect it from the
freshmen, but after two years?

licity. Hopefully students will do at
least a small amount of preparation
for each lecturer in order to be slight-
ly familiar with a speaker’s back-
ground. But if one planned on doing
so, he would have little time to pre-
pare for Miss Mead’s visit, coming
ard on the heels of Dr. Burns.

The speakers’ ineffectiveness was
heightened by their short visits. Miss
Mead was hardly here for a day, ar-
riving in the afternoon and giving
her last lecture the next night. Dr
Burns’ visit was somewhat longer,
lasting slightly less than two days.
Both speakers held informal discus-
sions soon after arriving on campus,
but few people seemed to be aware
of them, except as they learned of
them by word of mouth.

The Reynolds Lectureship has been
Davidson’s primary means of draw-
ing top-flight speakers. It’s a shame
for it not to be administered any
more efficiently.

We have seen the end of required Vespers serv-
ices, at least for a trial period of two years. No one
is jumping for joy, and a few people are even shed-
ding some tears.

The question goes beyond that of compulsory
worship services. I]t is at the heart of Davidson and
all the college stands for. Granted that you can’t
force religion upon people and that it is even incon-
sistent with the Christian ideal to compel people to
worship. Still there is something beneath all this.

CONCRETE DECISION

The faculty has once again made a “concrete”
decision without really attempting to deal with the
situation and .arrive at a satisfactory solution. True

it may be that the Board of Trustees left our adminis- ©

trators “holding the bag.” Still, the faculty was in
no way required to act in such a hurried manner.
___,, Vespers is gone. 0.K. But why do away with this
institution before providing a viable alternative
through which the College will be able to express
its Christian commitment?
_. DEFINITE PLAN

A committee will study the possibilities and will
present alternatives to the faculty for action, prob-
ably sometime early in the coming academic year.
But it seems that the action of the faculty should
have, been carried out with some definite plan in

__ Faculty meetings get long and discussion drags.

It is no doubt easier to come to a decision of some
sort than to see what lies behind the problem in-
volved. Behind the decision of the faculty is the en-
tire problem of the purpose of Davidson College.
The act remains that we are floundering at present,
and things like this make it more difficult than ever.

It is obvious that the problem will bear much
deeper study. In the interim why not just do away

The march began from the

abreast, the marchers walked to
the White House, marched in

to the monument on the other
side of the President's home.
At the monument, signs and
flags were discarded, and every-

banner. North Carolina was an
exception in that the majority
of its marchers were students.
Most of the others were from
Duke or Chapel Hill, with a cou-
ple from State.

Our group was larger than
the one from Chape! Hill and al-
most as large as Duke's. Sev-
eral people expressed surprise
that anybody from a conserva;
tive bastion like Davidson would
show up. During the march,
we could occasionally hear
(from sympathetic observers)
statements of surprise that Dav-
idson was represented.

COPS EVERYWHERE

Cops were everywhere: There
must have been one every three
yards along the march route.
Gordon Ball ‘snapped pictures
of every cop along the route,
including one who was making
an obscene gesture.

We were restricted to the
sidewalk, but traffic was closed
in alt but one street that we had
to cross,

We made sure that people
knew where we were from. On
one sign were hand-lettered the

. words ‘Davidson College, N. C.”

and then right below (which we
hoped, would be taken in the
tongue-in-cheek spirit with which
it was written), ‘Dean Rusk,
Class of °36.°° Nobody knew if
that were the right year, but it
sounded good enough.
SPECIAL DETAIL

a piece of tape around his left
arm. We figured it was prob-
ably for the purpose of taping

hold them voluntarily at least until some better solu-

There is no

way to know what kind of attendance the service
would receive until it is tried.
MOTIVES NECESSARY

We have shown ourselves prepared to move for-
ward in a constructive manner and to compete favor-
ably. But to make important moves without first
clearly having in mind just what we are trying to
accomplish is not to provide many answers.

All I ask is that we be certain of just what we
are trying to do and that we don’t move out of des-
peration under pressure of students or any other

group.

someone’s mouth shut, in case
of any trouble.

Joe Dial asked one of the
cops, a smiling Negro, what the
tape was for. The cop answer-
ed that he couldn't think of an
answer. A little later we asked
another cop, who replied that he
was a member of ‘‘a special de.
tall."

Just. before we reached the
White House, a lady across the
street yelled, ‘Are you all from
Duke?*’ Some of the Duke peo-
ple answered in the affirnia-
tive. She yelled back, ‘Weil,
I think y'all are a disgrace.”

LITTLE HECKLING

Other than that I heard very
little heckling. Most people just
looked. Across from the White
House, a group of about 20 peo
ple counter-picketed, carrying
signs which identified them as
members of the Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom. I got a kick
out of some of their signs: one
explained, ‘‘We Are for Peace,
Not Surrender” and the one. next
to it urged. ‘‘Bomb Hanoi."

Jack Woodall claimed he saw
Bill Moyers standing in the
White House yard. Nobody
claimed to see the President.

LARGE CROWD

When we got back to the
monument. the last of the parad-
ers had not yet left the reflect-
ing pool. Crowd estimates
ranged from. 7,000 to 12,000, and
it seemed to me the higher fig-
ure was closer to the actual
number.

The crowd was very orderly
(it made Vespers look like the
Democratic National conven.
tion). A Newport News news-
paper called it a mob in the
headline for their story on the
march. If it was a mob, then
it was a mob only in the sense
that any large group of people
is a mob.

FAR LEFT ELEMENT

There was some of the really
far left element present. Copies
of The Worker were being hawk. |
ed, but more in evidence were
vendors selling buttons with slo-
gans like ‘Make Love, Not
War."’ ‘God Is Alive — in the
White House,” and ‘Draft Beer.
Not Boys.’ Copies of the news-
papers of the Socialist Labor
party and the Youth Against
War and Fascism were being
handed out free. but few paid
much attention to them.

Speakers at the rally includ.
ed Norman Thomas, newspaper-
man 1. F. Stone, Irving Howe,
pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Sock .
(who marched at the. head of
the procession around the White
House), and cartoonist Jules
Feiffer.

HOLIDAY MOOD

The mood of the marchers
was generally a holiday onc, al-
though everyone was genuinely

f angry.

But occasionally during ‘the
rally even the holiday atmos-
phere was forgotten, as Norman
Thomas, his voice strained, be-
wailed the killing of American
troops, Viet Cong and Vietna
mese civilians, and as J. F.
Stone, crying at the end, prophe-
sied that .we are ‘‘marching to-
ward a bottomless pit of de-
Struction and devastation.”

CANNED CREDIBILITY

Feiffer ended the rally on a
comic (though no less serious)
note, Pointing out that televis-
ion producers use canned laugh-
ter to make funny those pro-
grams that are unfunny, Feiffer
suggested that the President use
canned credibility comments to
make credible those speeches
which are unbelievable.

During every public appear-
ance, comments like “He has
access to information we don’t
know,” or “He certainly doesn’t
have the face of someone who
wants a nuclear confrontation
with China’ could be run over
a “canned credibility track."

Then everyone got up, pick-
ed up the litter of Coke cups
and cigarettes, heard Pete See-
ger sing a folk song and went
