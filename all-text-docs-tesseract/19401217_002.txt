As the Year Ends

Christmas—.1940. Another vear almost
gone, a year which has seen sweeping
changes in the politieal and cconomie world;

a year in which blood has deeply stained:

the soti of the carth; a ycar whieh will not
soon be forgot.

This Christmas is 'not too ditierent. in
some respeets, trom last Christmas. }.ast
year there were bombers over Europe. but
-not so many. Last year there was a food
shortage in the war-stricken countries. but
not so bad. l.ast year there. were griei-
stricken parents, and dead boys, but not so
many,

Then there was no dratt. There is now.
Then we were determined (o szay owt of war
at all costs. Now we are not so sure. Then
we were bitterly debating the advisabtlity
of giving Mr. Roosevelt a third term. Now
we have done it, and the country ts solidly
henind him. Then we had fitth clumniszs

l -retiwe urovr vital industries. New it appears —

that these same persans, or others like them,
are SUIL here.

Not so long ago France was supposedly 2
thriving republic, But that has changed.
Not so long ago Italy was a non belligerent

,. partner in the Axis. That also bas changed.

"

Not so long agd only a few European natioss

_ were at war. That, too, is ditierent.

Vast and almost unbelievable changes
these are in some cases. Dut in most the
new ones come directly out of the old, and
‘gradually enough for all €6 foresce the fu
ture for a little. And no one expects changes
to stop now. In another year there will
probably ‘be morc. ditieresce in the world
and, national situation. or crisis (or better
vet, series of crises), than there has /veen
dunng the past three hundred and sixiy-
five days. That, too, is already foreseen by
our various commentators.

To what does it all lead? Armageddon? ~
- A better and more stable world condition ?

Who knows? Who could? Certainly no
humes.

So many analyses of the world situation
and its events have already been made thai
it is rather useless to attempt to find any
‘passible sollutién to. the “mess”- and in is

a “mess.”

3ut when all things are stripped of any
outward camouilage, the cntire situation
resolves into a struggle between bad and
worse: for wwe can hardly call the system
which we sirive to maintain good in its pres-
ent form, although we believe that it is
good as an ideal, and are sure it at least is

And 'so it was, thatf while they were there,
the davs were accomplished that she showid
be delivered. —

And she brought tort: her firstborn son: —|-

and wrapped him in swaddling clothes. and
jaid him in a manger: because there was no
room for them in the inn.

Aad there were in the saie country shep-
herds abiding in the ticlds, keeping watch
over their tlock by night

And, lo. the angel of the Lord came upon.
them. and the glory of the Lord shone round ~
ealiaut them: and they were sore afraid.

And the angel said unto them, Fear not:
ior, behold. U bring to. you good tidings of
great ioy which. shall he to all people.

For unto voiris born this day in the city
of David-a Saviour, whichris Christ the
Lord.

And this shall he a sign unto_youw. ve shall
find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
lying in a manger:

And suddenly there was with the angel a
inuititude of the heavenly host praising God..-
and saying,
—— Glorr— God in the highest. and on carth
“Peace. good will toward men.

—— And it came to pass, as the angels were—
gore away from (them into heaver; the

__shepherds. said one to another, Let us vow
go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing
which is come to pass, which the Lord hath
masle known unte us.” —

And they came with haste, and found
Mary, and Joseph. and the babe lying in [a
manger. .

And when they had. scen it, they made
known abroad the saying which was told
them conezrning the child.

And all that heard it wondered at those
things which were told them by the shep- -
herds. .

_But Mary kept all these things, and pon-
dered them in her heart.

_And, the shepherds returned, glorifying..
and praising God for all the things that they
had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

4 So

Just why is there the firm conviction in
the hearts of most of us that the Axis forees
cannot win the war? Our newsmen te)! us
that it is entirely possible. But do they really
. defieve that? Does our nation as a whole
‘think that Fitlér’s might will _ eventually
rule? Nol! ~

And why “tio”? Tg it beeanse we helieve
the Allies (what is TeTt of tiem) Have the
muhtary power tc avercome Mitler and Co.
or have more “stickadility ?” Is it because

@ think that America will back Britain up
to such a large extent that the Axis will. be
finally defeated? [s it bechuse we are con-
vineed that several other powers wiil join
the Enitish against Germany and italy? {s it
in the final analysis, because of any tangible
reason?

We do not believe that it is. It is our opin-

ion that the main reason Americans deep
inside tenaciously cling to the belief Gat
our system of government and that of the
English and other nations will survive ‘is a
spiritual one. We are convineed that “right
will triumph,” although we do not express
our conviction any more in this age of so-

phistication and woridliness. But that is the

fecling inside our hearts and minds. buried

there nevertheless.

Our nation is called “Christian,”
it is only nominally so. But it always has
been true, and will continuc to be so, when

reach out for us, it is to God that we turn.

Far beneath any false exterior, our souls
recognize our Maker, and depend on Him
for strength in times of crisis. This cannot
be denied, for it is even true at so hardened
a place as college: ~,

And now as the ycar passes, we need Him
to help us through the difficult days which
lie ahead. Why do we in America not rec-
ognize this need, and confess our Lord
openly? For when the outlook is dark, He
remains with us, through all things.

Congratulation to the Council on

for us. .

Recause Will Bradley can. play

The ‘band. #40 strong, features
Ray McKinley on drums, _Frediie

ruses. Saxes blend neatly and-cxe-

their selection for our

While capable of oulswinging al-
host any of today’s bands, Bradley
and McKinley's crew furnish an
amazing tlexible brand of dance-
time.- With Will's trombone leading
the melodic procession, the boys do
well by the sweetest ballad and can
also turn out a creditable rhumba.

McKinley is one of the -best drum
men iv the country. Possessing a
technique that, rivals Krupa’scin its
erystat clarity, it seems to this col-
umn that his ideas are more original
