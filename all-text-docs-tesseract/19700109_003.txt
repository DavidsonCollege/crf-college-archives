Dana Foundation Grants

Davidson and Queens cola

lege have each received a
Christmas gift of $100,000
from the Charles A. Dana
Foundation.

Since 1960-61 the founda-
tion has provided financial
aid and recognition for as
many as 20 students’ each
year. in each of the three
upper classes at Davidson
and Queens. In recent years
that has amounted to some
$40,000 annually to each in-
stitution.

“The investment income
from the $1000,000 gifts. will
provide each college at least
$5,000 a year for the scholar-
ships,” the presidents of the
two colleges noted in a joint
statement. ‘‘We hope to add
to the Dana Scholarship pro-
gram funds from other
sources as well.”

Smylie and Spencer prais-
ed the foiindation’s program
of support to higher educa-

tion as. ‘one of the country’s
finest. At both Queens and
Davidson it’ has ‘provided
generous subsidization for
faculty .salaries, substantial
financial aid to deserving
students, and thousands of

dollars in building programs
as well.”

The presidents estimated
that the foundation has given

Davidson some~™ $3 _ million
in the last 15 years.

Dand Scholars ‘are select
ed on the basis of "
demic proficiency, charact-
er and good citizenship, evi-
dence of leadership poten-
tial, and effectivé participa-
tion in the activities of the
college community.”

-At Davidson and Queens
the actual amount of each
grant depends primarily on
the student's financial need.

The scholarships are not
awarded to freshmen. But
“if during his first year a
student proves: tltat he has
the qualities and abilities of
a Dana Scholar, he will then
be eligible for substantial
scholarship help in the form
of a- Dana Scholarship § for
his last three years in Col-
lege.”

The Dana Foundation has
also provided an endowment
at both colleges for supple-
ments to salaries of several
professors.

Gifts for
Davidson have included
funds for the Dana Science
Laboratories, Richard-
son Hall (a dormitory), re
novation of the college union
and cafeteria, and the de-
velopment: of a recreation
area on Lake Norman.

At Queens funds have been
