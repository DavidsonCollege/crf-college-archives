A Change In The Weather

We find the housing predicament that many David-
son students are now faced with to be totally amazing.
No one seems to know exactly what is going to happen
to the hundred or so freshmen present!y without
rooms.

It is debatable whether 100 upperclassmen are
going to be willing to give up their rooms to face the
uncertainty of finding off-campus housing

Yet no contingency plans seem to have been drawn
up to face this eventuality. We suppose that the housing
officials will just play it by ear. which ts certainly not
acceptable to the student bodv

This latest crisis is just one in a series of blunders
made by the administration with regard to student
housing.

Last vear when the final report on coeducation was
made. there was ample warning given of the need tor
more housing At the time.evervone seemed to teel
that this need «ould be met

In this regard. we have been deceived Not anly has
the deadiine for the completion o: new dorms been
moved back another vear. but the administration lost
a good chance to get federal money 1n the winter ata
low interest rate. because of delays

What this all means 1s that much more monev must
now be raised to pay for any new housing. However.
the college has not even completed the fund raising
for the new library. It's anvbodv’s guess when the
money for the housing can be raised.

The effects of these complications can only mean
two things for Davidson students

First many students will have to live in the new
apartments being planned for Lake Norman. In this
regard we can only hope that the apartments will be
ready for occupation in the fall and suitable in price
and accomodations for students.

And secondly. as Director of Student Housing Scot-
tv Nicholls indicated. the enroliment will have to be
trozen tor next vear. which probably means that in-
creases.in the number of coeds will also have to wait

However. bx now students have gotten used to this
Kind of treatment There 1s notming we can do now but

Merited Recognition

The turnout and reception given Senator Sam Ervin
when he appeared on campus Wednesday was a
welcome change from the normal student reaction of
apathy and indifference to visiting lecturers.

The standing ovations signify well-merited
recognition of a man who has done much to preserve
the integrity of the Constitution. and who finally made
Richard Nixon capitulate. allowing his aides to testify
on the Watergate affair.

Our appreciation goes out to the Philanthropic
Society who brought the Senator to our campus.

Finally. we would urge students to attend more of
the lecturers. who although they might not be as
prominent as Senator Ervin. also have much to offer
if students would only give them the chance.
