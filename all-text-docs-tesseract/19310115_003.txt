State and Carolina Fall Before On-
slaught of Wildcats as Season
Opens in Charlotte

The characteristic fight and spirit of the
Davidson Wildcats enabled them to stage
a sensational rally to nose out the Univer-
sity of North Carolina Tar Heels in the
Armory at Charlotte on Saturday. night.
Over a thousand basketball fans were pres-
ent to see the Wildcats jump into the lead
of the State title race by their 18 to 17
victory over Carolina’s lanky basketeers.
The game started off slowly with the Tar
Heeels showing marked superiority but to-
wards the end of the game, with the out-
come hanging on any counter, every spec-
tator was on his feet shouting with excite-
ment.

The slick floor and height of their oppo-
nents so hampered the Wildcats that they
were able to score but one field goal in the
first half, and the rangy Carolina five came
off the court at half-time leading, 13 to 6.
Wilmer Hines, forward, and “Sandy” Dam-
eron were the Carolina stars of the first
half, each making some beautiful shots from
the floor/ )

“At the eginning of the second half, -the
forerunner \of the rally-to-be showed itself.
Captain Goodson made good a foul shot and
then sank 4 beautiful shot from mid-court.
This was: immediately“followed by a pretty
under-the-basket shot by Pierce. Alexander
and Dameron, however, offset these goals by
sinking floor shots and made the score 17
to 11. At this point “Doc” Mathis entered
the game and put his team in the running
by sinking two beautiful shots from the
floor. Proctor made good a foul to put the
fighting Wildcats one point behind the Tar
Heels. With everyone aroused to the high-
est pitch of excitement, the game continued
at top speed. It was left to Captain “Sleepy”
Goodson ‘to slip under the Tar Heel goal
and sink one to give the Davidson team
its one-point lead and subsequent victory.
With the closing gun ready to fire, the Uni-
versity team strove frenziedly to score, but
each attempt rolled harmlessly off the basket
or bounded from the backboard. Just as the
closing gun was fired, Rusk sank a long
one for the Wildcats, which was a hair too
late to be counted. :

Goodson, Mathis, and Rusk were the out-
standing men in the Davidson line-up, while
Marpet, Alexander, and Dameron shone for
Carolina.

Davidson 26—N. C. State 19

The widely-heralded Red Terrors of North
Carolina State found Captain Goodson and
his 1931 basketball cohorts more than a
match for their fast triple passes and were
forced to take the short end of a 26 to 19
score. The game was played in the Char-
lotte High School gymnasium before a good
crowd.

The State team started off in fine style
and seemed to be in complete control of
the game even before the ending of the first
half. A bewildexing short pass attack got
the State team through the defense of the
Wildcats time after time in the opening pe-
riod, while a great man-to-man defense kept
the Davidson score down. However, shortly
before the ending of the half, Captain Bill
Goodson made three beautiful counters in
quick succession to tie the score as the half
ended.

The Wildcats came on the floor in the sec-
ond half in a fighting mood. So close was
their guarding of the Red Terror threats
in the last half that the State five could
only register five points. At the same time,
Martin ard Pierce, playing their first year
as regulars on the Davidson varsity, be-
gan running up the Wildcat score with
some beautiful floor shots. As the Wildcats
forged ahead, the game increased in speed
with the State five striving desperately to
make some of their shots good and still hold
back the onrush of the Davidson counters.
With only a few minutes left to play, the
Wildcats put on a beautiful exhibition of
guarding to hold in~check-the-raging Ter-
rors. Shortly before the end of the game,
Pierce and Rusk added field goals to swell
the Davidson advantage.

Grier Martin was high point man of the
game and put up a beautiful floor game.
Captain Goodson was a power of strength

Student Body Adopts
Sportsmanship Code

Coach Younger and Capt. Pritchett
Formulate Rules to Better
Athletic Relations

At a meeting of the student body on Tues-
day after chapel exercises, a code of sports-
manship, the joint work of Captain Nor-
ton G. Pritchett, of the physical education
department, and Coach W. L. Younger, was
voted on and adopted. The purpose of the
code is to formulate better sportsmanship
for basketball at,Davidson.

Similar codes, it was stated, will be drawn
up for the other athletic sports here at Da-
vidson College. This is the first time in the
college history that such a -policy has been
adopted.

The document as passed by the student
body follows:

“In an attempt to formulate a definite
policy or code of sportsmanship for basket-
ball at Davidson College, I suggest that the
student body adopt the following code:

1. I shall consider my athletic opponents
as my guests,

2. I will always cheer the opposing team
when it appears upon the floor.

3. I will clap for the opponent who makes
a good play.

4. I will remain quiet while opponents
are making free throws.

5. .1 will cheeran opponent who is injured
in the game.

6. I will give the opponents a yell after
the game.

7. I will never deride any official.

8. I will be courteous to all visitors.
9. I will remain until the game is over.
10. I will play fair and hard until the last

whistle blows, or the gun is fired.

11. I will remember that the reputation
of the collége depends upon my conduct dur-
ing the game and after it.

12. 1 will give opposing rooters fair op-
portunity for their yells.

13. 1 will applaud good cheering by my
opponents.

14. I shall not indulge in personal re-
marks—whistling, hissing, or any other form
of poor sportsmanship.

15. I believe that good sportsmanship
means the application of the Golden Rule.

16. I will endeavor to make Davidson
College known for its good sportsmanship.

Signed: W. L. Younger.”

"EM OVER

Two of the best basketball games that
have been seen in a long, long time were
staged in Charlotte last week. And by
their wins in these contests, the David-
Wildcats. established themselves as
one of the strongest teams in the state.
Both N. C. State and Carolina were
strong; both had overcome strong op-
position in preseason games; and these
facts made Davidson's victories over them
all the more impressive and important.

It is hardly likely that a Davidsn bas-
ketball team has had as strong opposition
in its first week of play before. Meeting
two of the leading teams of North Caro-
lina and one of the most powerful of
South Carolina within a week is a pretty
big assignment for any group of players.
And ‘when it all comes in their first week
of work, their good showing in those
games is all the more to be marveled at.

This column was written before the

son

not know the outcome of that
game. However, we are confident that it
was as much of a thriller as either of the
Rig Five contests last week.

And while on the subject, the last five
minutes of the Carolina engagement pro-
duced as fast and as nerve-tingling bas-

we do

ketball as we have ever seen. 9
Monk Younger's problem of finding a
forward to work with Rusk seems to have
been solved. In fact, he has uncovered
two men, either of whom can be put in
the game with no weakening whatsoever
of the squad. Martin and Mathis have
played heads-up ball throughout and the
battle which should develop between the
two for the first string berth will be. well
worth watching. Martin seems to have a
slight edge because of his greater height.

However, Mathis’ entry into the Caro-
|lina game in the second half seemed to
mark the beginning of the rally and his

Fresh Elect Evans
Basketball Captain

R. H. “Bob” Evans, star forward and lead-
ing scorer of the Freshman basketball team,
was elected captain of the Wildkitten five
at a meeting held last Friday, January 8.
He had served .as captain in the Frosh’s
first three games.

Prior to coming to Davidson, Evans had
played amateur basketball in Youngstown,
Ohio, his home, for six years. He also saw
service in the class games held during De-
cember. Playing with the Freshman entry,
Evans was outstanding in his floor work and
goal shooting. He is a pledge in the Theta
Upsilon Omega fraternity.

feated Phi Gamma Delta in a close, hard-
fought game, 18-17, and Kappa Alpha put
out Pi Kappa Phi, 23-8. S. A. E. received
a bye to the semi-finals.

Kappa Sigma is now in the finals by vir-
tue of a bye and awaits the winner of the
S. A. E. and Kappa Alpha game. The finals
will be played after the exams. The date
has not as yet been set.

I'rskine game last night and so of course |,

two long, arching shots evened things up
end put Davidson once more within strik-
ing distance of the then fast-moving Tar
Heels. We don’t know what caused it but
the game certainly moved much faster
after he went in. Davidson showed much
more fight and faster passing then they
had at any time before.

Rawson, referee of the game, was de-
rided more than any official at a David-
son game in a long time. We won't go into
the rights or wrongs of the booing at that
particular time, but certainly it was very
unsportsmanlike. Much of the crowd
Was not made up of Davidson students,
but nevertheless, a number of students
joined in. It is very hard for one man to
call a game as fast as basketball on a
court the size of the Armory pfaying
floor. The Athletic Association would have
done well to use the two-official system
in Saturday’s game which met with such
success in the State affray. It would make
the task of both officials much easier and
would have given a much better game.

But why wasn’t that last goal counted?
It looked like the ball was in the air
When the gun shot.

We think the student. body owes the._
Athletics Association a great debt of
thanks for the. way they treated the stu-
dents at the two games last week. It meant
a larger sacrifice in the coin of the realm
for them to let the student body in free
to one game and at half-price to the
other. We thank them.

Before passing on, what about that
Duke game? We have had several com-
ments on that suggestion that it be play-
ed here if possible. Most of those whom
we have talked to have been more than
willing to pay to see the game on the
home court. If it has not been placed, we
would like to see it come to Davidson.

For the next ten days athletics go into
their coma whilst the profs have their
semi-annual sports holiday called “shoot-
ing the students.” No interscholastic
events are carded from last night until
Siturday week when V. P. I. plays here
at the close of exams.

However, with the close of the scholas-
tic tryouts, things begin to pick up ap-
preciably. Four or five events are billed
for the last week in January, and Feb-
ruary shows 25 or more in its meagre 28
days.

Coach Unger says that a few more grap-
plers have reported but that there’s still
room on the mat for as many as want to
come out. And pitchers won't be so very
scarce if we haye many more snows. A
swimming team wouldn't need a pool to
practice in, Just try to go down town on
some rainy day. Just try. The freshmen
basketball team evidently had a Merry
Christmas and has come back to do big
things. They looked much improved in
their lone home appearance after the holi-
days. No paper next week.
