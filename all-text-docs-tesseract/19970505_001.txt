Robert F. Vagt was announced
as Davidson’s 16th president on

Friday. He will succeed John W. :

Kuykendall on July 1.

Renowned for his leadership,
diligence, vision, and creativity,
Bobby Vagt promises to embody
the Davidson spirit as its future
president.

Vagt, a student from Connecti-
cut, arrived at Davidson in 1965 and
became active on- and off-campus
immediately. Working an assort-
ment of jobs throughout his four
years to pay his tuition, he also
managed to swim on the varsity
swim team, hold an ROTC schol-
arship, win the Agnes Sentelle
Brown Award, participate as a
brother in Pi Kappa Alpha, serve as
a hall counselor and become elected
president of the Interfraternity
Council. In 1969, he graduated
with a major in psychology and was
later clinically: certified.

Vagt has diligently maintained
his affiliation with Davidson in the
years since his graduation. In 1996

. he received Davidson’s Alumni Ser-
vice Award for numerous volunteer
leadership roles in college
fundraising, including two years as
national leader of the Annual Fund
from 1993-1995. He has been a
member of the college’s Board of
Visitors since 1992 and is a mem-
ber of the Ne Ul-

the minimum-security
McLeansville Correctional
Facility from 1969-1973.

From 1975-1979 he
worked in New York State’s
Division, of the Budget and
its Housing, Medical Care
Facilities, and Project fi-
nance agencies to help the
City avert a series of finan-
cial crises and potential
bankruptcy. He furthered
this career in public finance
through 1980 as executive
director for the Municipal
Assistance Corporation, the
state agency designed to
keep New York City afloat
during the mid1970s when
the City was in dire eco-
nomic straits.

Since. 1980 Vagt has
directed operations for three
international oil and gas
companies in New York
City and Houston. Initially
he helped to create Adobe
Resources, where he served
as president and chief oper-
ating officer. When that

“Bobby is admired and re-
spected by our employees,” says
Janet Hughes, his Executive Assis-
tant of the past five years. “He is
always approachable, honest and
down to earth. Many of us have
leaned on him as a mentor. His
management style is the kind which
inspires loyalty and a desire to ex-
cel. Bobby provides goals and ob-
jectives for his people, and apart
from periodic informal meetings to
‘touch base,’ one is trusted to do the
job in a self-paced environment.”

Vagt, during his enrollment at
Davidson, taught Sunday school at
DCPC and decided during his jun-
ior year to study for the ministry.
He carried out this plan initially as
pastor of a church in Wilkesboro for
$20 a week. Vagt went on to earn a
Master’s of Divinity degree from
Duke University and was subse-
quently ordained by Concord
Presbytery.

Though he chose not to pastor
a church he has maintained his or-
dination and consistently minis-
tered to the Presbyterian churches
where he lived as a parish associ-
ate, with a primary responsibility
for youth programs. He also gives
occasional sermons and regularly
presides over weddings and funer-
als. As a parish associate he holds
a full-time secular position, but
spends countless volunteer hours
leading youth groups and teaching
Sunday school.

Dr. Fair, “Fairfax,” pastor of St.
Phillip Church in Houston where
Vagt attends, says she has “never
known a kid who didn’t like him
immediately.- He interacts great
with all age groups, making every-
thing relevant and insightful.” As a
testament to his warmth and vigor,

she relates the story of how Vagt
once phoned a youngster in his con-
gregation long distance from Rus-

group. “He comes with a great ea-
gerness to pitch in any way he can.”
His wife Ruth Anne and daughter
Lindsey are also known for their
participation with the missions
committee and missions to Merida,
Mexico each year.

Vagt married Ruth Anne Max-
well midway through his senior
year at Davidson, and the couple
has remained happily married for
twenty-nine years. They have two
daughters. Ashley is a 1995 gradu-
ate of Davidson College working at

Lynchburg College for her master’s
degree in education. Lindsey is a
high school senior who will enroll
at Davidson in the fall.

When Vagt was a student at
Davidson, he promised to “work
until I find the very best job that
exists in this world. Here I am.”

Trustees, faculty, administra-
tion, and students solicited thou-
sands of nominations, reviewing
about 150 of them and then inter-
viewing around 12.

The biggest task is still ahead,
according to Presidential Search
Committee chair Larry Dagenhart.
“After selecting a president, we’ve
got to nurture a president,” he says.
