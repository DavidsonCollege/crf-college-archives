The Davidsonian

POOR actin

IN A Castle scent from “The White Cat”, by Davidson professor Rupert T.

Barber, Prince Treeble [ Kriss Childress] completes the first of three quests in
his rise to the throne of the Kingdom of Troate. Prince Treeble graciously
receives “the most beautiful little dog in the world’’ from his newfound love,

Princess Blanchette [ Karen’ Weir].

Studies ruffle memories

Two weeks have passed since the
end of the Christmas holidays and in
that time my professors have man-

paged to shovel on its memory seven-
teen homework assignments, three
daily writs, two major tests, and a
novel.

The question ‘‘Whud juh do over
break?’’ has long since been replaced
by ‘‘How’d your test come out?’’ and
other even less worthy standbys.

What seemed so important to me
two weeks ago has shriveled in
significance and I now remember
something that I never even thought
to tell about.

I remember the Barn Owls.

Two nights before I rode back to
college everything which I had plan-
ned for the holidays had been either
done or abandoned. I was ready to
pack my suitcase and settle down
with a few books.

Then an old friend called. He said
that he had just come in from a walk
through the decayed downtown sec-
tion of my hometown. He said that he
had discovered a family of Barn Owls.

It wasn’t long before I met him,
along with his brother and nephew, on
a sidewalk in tront ot an old deserted
Victorian house. That’s atmosphere

‘Hear um,”’ he said

‘Hear what?”’ I said.

But by then I didn’t need an
answer. An almost continuous raspy
screeching, like the sound of a metal
raking broom being whisked across

cement, was coming from a large oak ’

tree across the street.

We stood in the dark and listened
for a while. People walked by, talking
loudly and occasionally laughing.Cars

with their windows down and radios
whining loud songs.

Not one of these noises sounded so
obnoxious as the birds.

Window

Suddenly there was a pallid waver
in the sky and one of the young owls
landed on a limb behind us. We shot
the flashlight on it. An adult bird
passed over and tossed down a
chestnut ball of fur.

The pale-bellied, cat-sized owl rip-
ped into the flesh, threw up its
monkey-face, arched its golden wigs
and swallowed.

“It’s a turtle. It’s'a turtle,’’ yelled a
little girl in a dark coat who had snuck
up behind us on the sidewalk. ‘‘It’s a
turtle isn’t it?”’

She stared up intently.

‘No. It’s an owl,” said my friend

Her expression did not change
Eventually she became either fright
ened or bored and left. Not wanting to
frighten the owls from the area, so did
we.

Just before I got in my car to go
home, I paused.

Drama

Barber deligh [Ss

with cnilaren’s play

(Editor's note: The first play ever
written by Drama Professor Barber
was so successful that an extra
performance had to be added. The
Charlotte Observer even hawked it as
last weekend's best entertainment bet
for the area. In spite of its reception
there are no plans for future perfor-
mances. So we decided to break our
rule about stressing past events in
order to print this review.)

“A New Play for Children,’’ reads
the program cover of The White Cat.
Nothing could be farther from the
truth, for Rupert T. Barber’s recent
stage creation is an event for every-
one. If Walt Disney Studios had first
conceived the notion of this play, it
would soon be appearing on marquees
across the land as a major motion
picture.

Mr. Barber has found for himself a
wonderfully simplified creation that
would rival Alice in Wonderland in
imagination, but along lines that a
two-year-old can follow.

Here the audience discovers a fairy
tale set in unheard kingdoms of old,
with a senile king, a lovely princess, a
daring prince, and a villain so
hysterically amusing that his evil
magic is anything but threatening.

The audience is first confronted by
King Trosston of Troatt (Paul Schlei-
fer) and Lord Triski, the Lord Most
Helpful (Joel Shirk). One soon dis-
covers how Triski acquiggd his guard-
ian angel title, for he and the king
engage in a fruitless search for the
blind king’s glasses amongst the
audience.

Audience participation is essential,
especially among the children pre-
sent, for the king and Triski question
many youngsters as to the wherea-
bouts of the ‘royal glasses.”’

Trosston fails to retrieve them,
accusing a boy in the crowd of sitting
on them, and another boy of conceal-
ing the ‘‘royal sceptor.”’

The controlling idea of the play is a
matter of great concern to the king,
when he can remember it. With
Triski’s assistance, he comes to the
realization that he has quite a ‘‘few

iy MOR

LOyS In the attic,’’ and must choose a
successor among his three sons before
the kingdom is lost.

He decides to have a contest in
three parts, the winner to become the
next monarch. The princes depart on
their first mission, to find ‘‘the most
beautiful little dog in the world.”

~ The next scene takes us t6 the

enchanted Two Kingdoms of Kats-
holm, where we find Princess Blanch-
ette (Karen Weir) and her Lady-in-
waiting, Lady Minnue (Hilary Clou-
ser).

Princess Blanchette is in a very
distressed state, for she has been
turned into a white cat by the sinister
Purple Fairy (Tom Bessellieu). This is
Mr. Bessellieu’s finest role ever at
Davidson, and he alone is worth going
to see.

Prince Treeble, the Youngest (Kriss
Childress) soon makes his way to the
castle of Princess Blanchette, where
they are inevitable ‘tombe amour-
eux.’’ The princess produces ‘‘the
beautiful little dog in the
“which is so small that it lives

most
world,
inside an acorn.

Treeble takes the dog to Troatt,
winning the first contest.

The second contest sends Prince
Triski (Ted Jones), Prince Trinlynn
(Michael Garrett), and Treeble in
search of ‘‘the finest cloth in the
world.”’

Once again, Princess Blanchette
produces the goods for the love of her
life, a cloth so fine that it cannot be
seen with the ‘‘royal magnifying
glass,’’ only. felt. :

Upon announcing Treeble as the
winner of the second contest, the king
reveals that the cloth shall be used to
make curtains in Pipsqueak’s room
(the smallest, most beautiful dog in

The third contest sends the three
princes off on a year-long adventure,
to find ‘‘the most beautiful princess in
the world.’’ Of course, Treeble leaves
once again for Katzholm, retrieving
Princess Blanchette. The other two
princes venture into a far away
kingdom, returning with the daugh-
