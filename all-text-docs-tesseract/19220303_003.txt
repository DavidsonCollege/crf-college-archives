STUDENTS TO SPEAK AT THE
Y. M. C. A. NEXT SUNDAY.

The “Y” program on Sunday will in-
clude four student speakers: Pat Craw-
ford, of the Junior class; Doc LaFar, Jim
Sprunt, and Mac Richards, of the Senior
class. These men are leaders in the
campus life and their messages will be
well worth hearing. It is good to hear
the men who are within the student
circle and the speakers secured will in-
sure a worthwhile program for all who
attend the “Y” meeting next Sunday.

DR. W. H. FRAZER SPEAKS AT
“Y” ON HAVING BACKBONE

An evidence of the impression made
by Doctor Frazer, President of Queens
College, in an address to the Y. M. C. A.
last Sunday, was given in the large num-
ber of those who went up to speak to
him after the service. In a fiery, inter-
esting address he appealed for uncondi-
tional loyalty to that which is right, re-
gardless of all consequences. Constant
reference was made to the three Israel-
ites, Shadrach, Meshach,and Abednego,
in all trying times. The address was
well begun by suitable humorous
marks.

When Nebuchadnezzar, with his ideas
of world-conquest, set up the jgolden
image and ordered all to worship _ it,
three men were bold eriough to resist.
To bow before the image was an easy
thing to do, and yet to refuse meant
death, according to the word of the
king. Still, in spite of this, these men
put their trust in God and showed their
manhood by living up to their convic-
tions in this and all other trying cases.

_The speaker then showed that the ma-
jority of people today still follow the
example .of the multitudes who bowed
before the image. They set aside the
power of conviction and follow the ex-
ample of the great common herd. They
consider their own interests and ad-
vancement rather than take the initiat-
ive in standing up for the right, a thing
which requires true manhood.

It was also pointed out that these
three men formed their decision regard-
less of what was the consequence of it.
They also did it immediately and with-
out argument, just as Abraham obeyed
when: God ordered him to sacrifice Isaac.
They put no “if” in their contract with
God. And because they’ exercised this
faith, God protected them when they
were cast into the fiery furnace.

The closing thought was that we
should also step out four-square on an
unconditional religion, forsake evil re-
gardless of consequences, and thus find
our Helper waiting. Doctor Frazer
closed the service with a prayer.

MINISTERIAL BAND PLANS
FOR A CLOSER
FELLOWSHIP

At the usual meeting of the Ministerial
Band on Sunday, February 26th, there
was no special speaker or program. Aft-
er a brief talk by the president, the meet-
ing was thrown open for talks by any
one present. T. H. Patterson, the pres-
ident, spoke on Christian fellowship, tak-
ing incidents in Christ’s life for his ex-
amples. He told of the danger of sub-
stituting “like” for “love” in our devo-
tion to Christ, and advocated the closest
fellowship possible among the followers

‘of Christ and between them and Christ.

Using the passage, “Feed my sheep,”
he said that we should show Christ to
others/as a testimony of our love for
Him. After this Taylor, Summers, Wal-
thall, H-D. Brown and Fraser made
short talks on the methods of securing

the fellowship advocated by the presi-
dent, The meeting was very helpful be-
cause of these heart-to-heart talks.

The Band is planning for more de-
velopment along social lines. To this
end a social committee, composed of
Fraser, Gamble, and White, was ap-
pointed. In order to bring the members
of the Band closer together, the nick-
names of all the members have been
gathered together. These, along with
the real names, will be mimeographed
and distributed among the Band. Then
thére will be a contest to see who can
learn them all the quickest. The Band
believes that actions speak louder than
words and so is doing more than merely
talking about “fellowship.”

VOLUNTEER BAND STAGES A
FINE FEED AND TALK FEST

Last Saturday night, immediately after
the movies, the Volunteer Band gave a
feed, having as its guests those interest-
ed in the Band and the things for which
it stands, and Drs. Arbuckle and Porter
as honor guests and special speakers.

Upon the doors being thrown open,
the hungry guests beheld the witching
sight of long tables groaning under the
weight of heaps of succulent edibles of
every description. The kind hosts,
knowing that the craving “inner man”
is wont to be impatient, insisted that
all lose no time in satisfying their long-
ings, which request was vigorously com-
pitied with,

After all had eaten until they would
have been ashamed to look an honest,
law-abiding chicken-salad sandwich in
the face, a joke-telling contest was held.

Those entering the contest were some
comical, some pathetic. Among these
was “Chef” McAlpine, who, being
spurred on by his recent success on the
stage, entered, thirsting for the laurels
of victory and emerged wearing the
crown of triumph, which proved to be
an Eskimo pie. Not to be outdone by
him, “Junebug” Price and Wallace Purdy
also won coveted Eskimo pies.

Had there been enough pies left, prob-
ably all in the contest would have re-
ceived them, But as there were only
five left, two of which had to go to the

judges, Doctor Arbuckle and Doctor
Porter, who refused to render their
services unless pie were forthcoming,

only three remained to go to the three
best jokers.

When the Contest, which was thor-
oughly enjoyed by all, was ended, a more
serious side was turned to.

Doctor Porter told of his experiences
in India and why he answered the call
to go. Doctor Arbuckle followed him,
giving an inspiring and helpful talk. The
Band was very fortunate in having these
two members of the faculty with them

and it is certain that their talks were

enjoyed by all.

Ed Cunningham spoke for the Band,
welcoming the guests and explaining
briefly the purpose of the feed. Walter
Knox responded in behalf of the guests,
thanking. the Band for their hospitality
and assuring them-of the appreciation

\of the guests.

The feed will live long in the memory
of those present as one of the best and
most successful of the year, in which
there was just the right proportion of
mirth and seriousness.

R. D. Hall, ’20, “Prep” Hall, ’20, and E.
P. Hall, ’20, of Belmont were on the hill
for the game Saturday. “Prep” Hall, an
old Wildcat guard, is coach of the Bel-
mont team.

D.
H. M. DeLorme, ex-’24, and Dyer
Barnum, ex-'24, of Sumter, S. C., spent
Sunday on the hill with friends.

At the regular meeting of the Volun- |

Hoye revealed some of the startling re- |

ing in our Mexican mission fields. His |
talk was introduced by’a brief geograph- |

showed that the country was not such |
a wilderness as is generally supposed.
Hoye stated that Roman Catholicism is

A brief summary of his speech}
will show that many of the priests of}
the Catholic Chutch in Mexico are un-|
scrupulous and immoral. By their vows?
they are forbidden to marry, but they |
openly have children just the same.
Their fees for marrying the natives are
so high that they cannot be paid in many |
cases and thus among the lower classes |
cf people that institution almost |
abandoned, It is easily seen what the)
moral conditions of the poor people are. |
The priests practice intolerance and at |
frequent intervals send authoritative |
persons throughout the country who |
collect all the Bibles distributed by our
missionaries and have a Bible burning. |
This is a great hindrance to the Chris- |
tian work and in fact is one of the most)

ent-day missionary there. On account

of these great obstacles less progress has |
been made in Mexico than in any other |

On account of the recent revolution |
in Mexico our missionaries were com- |
pelled to come back to the United States |
for a period, but have returned. |
However, the revolution seemed to work
cut for the good of the Presbyterian
missionaries, for when they returned if
was to a new field located just south of
Mexico City. Here they seem to have
better results as hard-

THE MICROBE OF LOVE

(Continued from page 1)
dress to the bachelors by Jeremiah Hen-
peck (P. H. MeAlpine), the star actor of
the evening. In an eloquent speech he
showed the folly of married life and be- |
sought the bachelors never to let women
inveigle them into matrimony. Finally
his flow of oratory was cut short by ‘the
arrival of Mrs. Henpeck (Miss Margaret
Davidson) who pulled him back to his)
domicile by one ear. |

The final act was a garden party ar-|
ranged by Madame Cupid at which the}
microbe was injected :into the bachelors |
with telling effect. A feature of this)
act was the song and dance performance |
of Miss Martha Gibbs and Flop Beaver :|
“I'm Looking for a Sweetheart.” After
each of the spinsters had obtained the)
consummation of her heart's desire in the,
person of a bachelor, the wedding of |
Madame Cupid and Billie Bachelor took |
place as the grande finale.

The chorus, composed of Misses Gibbs, |
White, Christenbury, Hood,. Johnson, |
Shelton, Potts, Goodrum, Porter, and|
Helper contributed a large share to the |
enjoyment with their
graceful dancing, bewitching appearance |
and melodious song. :
