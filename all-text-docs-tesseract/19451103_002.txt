‘ourselves what we would.

Are We Wrong? -

There has been a great deal of talk
lately about dances, especially those which
are supposed to be held off campus. Last
year the faculty changed the regulations
so that dancés could be held on the cam-
pus, which was the first time in the his-
tory of the school such a thing has oc-
cured. The first campus dance was Mid-

winters and it was a joyous occasion. The,,

gym was decorated to an nth degree, the
music was good, and one of the most im-
portant things is that the girls had a place
to stay, Duke dormitory. The following
dance was just as much a success, as
doubtlessly the rest of them will. be, but
we are forgetting one thing. These dances
are put on by the entire student body.

When the faculty decided these mea-
sures they apparently made another rule
which was the abolishment of all dances
off campus. This is a drastic step from
the student’s point.of view, for I do not
believe that they wanted a complete nulli-
fication of off-campus dances. it seems
plausible that the faculty would have
thought of fraternities and other organi-
zations when they imposed this regulation.
Everyone knows what the gym looks
and the price of decorating it would
well over any small” ofganization’s
budget. Also the usual run of a social
night for a fraternity is to have a banquet
before the dance, but there is no suitable
place in Davidson to have a formal dinner.
Fraternities make up a great part of the
college life and when you curtail the social
life of a fraternity, you have no fraterni-
ties.

There is also another reason in this
case. When our parents sent us off to col-
lege, along with the farewell kisses, they
were trying to impress upon us that this

was the time in our life when we would
become men, if we were not already. They
also ‘said that we were masgers of our-
selves and it was up to us to make of
By this we are
not saying that we are not trusted, but
merely that’ we should be allowed to be on
our own once ina while, The men_return-
ing from the wars will find it difficult to
live under rules with no exceptions, for
they are masters of themselves and the
rest of the student body is quickly ap-
proaching, that point. We are not high
school students.

We realize the position it would put
the faculty if they backed down, but sure-
ly an amendment to the rule would not be
too much. If small dances were to be held
in Charlotte, the rest of the rule would
apply. The girls would stay in Duke, ex-
cept those who reside in Charlotte, certain
hours would be observed, and the proper
chaperons would be appointed. Nothing
would be changed except the place, and as
any playwright could tell you, if you
don’t like the players you can always look
at the scenery.

We do not believe it is asking too
much for these things. That is why we
ask you, are we wrong?

U

Compulsory Military
Training
PRO .

After the last war there was a com-
plete state of demobilization, we all know
that, and we all know that it led to our
unpreparedness in this one. If we are go-
ing to police the world as we planned then
it is necessary for us to keep a large stand-
ing-army-on hand at-alltimes. No-doubt
there will be another war, in spite of the
threats of the atom bomb. That same
kind of threat was used by some distant
cousin of ours when he invented the bow
and arrow. Manpower has been becoming
increasingly important through the years,
and it is necessary for us to be equal if
not more powerful than the others. :

CONT.

Compulsory military training would
tend to extinguish from our great nation
that democracy which our forefathers
fought so valiantly to obtain. It is not to
be overlooked that a peacetime army and
navy composed of. volunteers would serve
more effectively. To snatch a boy up just
after his graduation from high school
would greatly interrupt his plans for at-
tending college or engaging in any other
occupation,

Now that we've won the war let’s
win the peace. But to do this we must pre-
pare ourselves for leadership and secure
And
how can this possibly be when our lives
would be so agitatedly interrupted by com-
pulsory military training?
