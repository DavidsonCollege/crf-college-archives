Thursday, November 16 — Take a

Chance

Another of the popular musical com-
cdies of the present day, and more
luxuriant than the majority of these.
James Dunn and Cliff Edwards play
the comedy roles, with June Knight,
Suddy Rogers, Lillian Roth and Lil-
lian Bond. Some very good songs are
presented, and the picture is very en-
tertaining. Among the songs are
“Eadie Was a Lady,” and “I’m a
Night Owl.” The trio of Dunn, Ed-
wards and June Knight are shown in
their trip from carnival shows to the
stage,

Friday,, November 17—My Lips Betray

Lilian Harvey is back again in one
of the shows which presents her to
the best advantage, in a singing role.
John Boles is in the lead and El Bren-
del is also in the cast. John Boles
sings very good, and the picture is
very good, and should not be missed.
18 — White

Saturday, November

Woman

Carole Lombard takes the lead, in
the part of the White Woman, and
Charles Laughton gives another fine
characterization. Kent Taylor and
Charles Bickford are also in the cast,
which is good. The show is very new,
having been released in the past few
days, and consequently there is no in-
formation concerning it.

Monday and Tuesday, November 20
and 21—Olsen’s Big Moment

Another one of the most recently re-
leased pictures, starring in a comedy
role, and his come-back to the screen
in this and in “My Lips Betray” is
very good. Barbara Weeks takes the
feminine lead,

Dr. Richards Speaks
To Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band held its regu-
lar meeting Thursday night at nine,
in the Y. M. C. A. building. After
listening to the Scripture as read by
Herbert Lucas, and being led in pray-

er by Don Brandon and Woody
Thrower, the band enjoyed a very
helpful and interesting talk by Dr.

C. M. Richards. :

Dr. Richards began by warning
those present that his message might
prove discouraging to some in view
of the fact that approximately twenty
thousand ministers throughout the
land are without churches, and that
many entered the ministry because it
presented itself to them as a_profes-
sion which practically guaranteed a
comfortable living. However, he made
a plea to the candidates for the min-
istry to enter the work of the church,
accepting their call as a divine privil-
ege rather than assuming the attitude
of the professional man, “ Now,” said
Dr. Richards, “is the time to learn to
do hard, intellectual and faithful study-
ing—a characteristic of good minis-
ters.”

On Sunday evening, November 5,
Herbert Lucas, president of the band,
led the service of the Pineville Pres-
byterian Church, the pastor of which
is a Davidson alumnus, the Rev. W. A.
Nicholson. Woody Thrower, a mem-
ber of the church, introduced the
speaker and read the Scripture for
the service.

Tucker and McClain
Entertain at Chapel

The student body was favored at the
chapel exercises last Friday by sev-
eral numbers rendered by Frank Tuck-
er and Dave McLain, members of the
Davidson Glee Club.

Tucker opened the program by sing-
ing “Old Man River.” Called back
by applause for two songs he sang
“River Stay "Way From My Door”
and “Roses of Picardy.” Tucker’s en-
tertainment was received) with much
enthusiasm by the students, as shown
by round after round of applause.

Dave McLain, accompanied at the
piano by Professor James Pfohl, sang
two numbers, “The Jolly Roger,” and
“Run, Mary, Run,” which were re-
ceived with equal appreciation.

Church Attendance
Is Topic of Debate

“ Resolved: That Church Attendance
3e Compulsory at Davidson College,”
was the topic of debate at the Eu-
menean Literary Society meeting
Tuesday night. E. F. Horine defend-

ed the affirmative and E. L. Bivens
assumed the negative.
The crux of the argument was

whether better Christian results would
be obtained through compulsion or
with the students being allowed to fol-
low their own conscience.

The negative maintained that com-
pulsion often put the student in such
a frame of mind that he got no ben-
efits from the service, and that after
being compelled to go to church for
four years, upon graduation he would
be so relieved that he would not at-
tend services at all.

The affirmative, on the other hand,
maintained that compulsion would put
the student in the habit of attending
church and that after all, sacrifice was
part of religion. A true Christian,

contended the affirmative, would at-
tend services for the sheer love of it,
and regardless of how boring the
service was, some beneficial effects
were to be found in it.

Davidson Student Body
Gives Repeal Majority

The Davidson student body favored
repeal of the 18th amendment by a
majority of 25, a straw vote poll con-
ducted last week revealed. The result
was 255 favoring and 230 against re-
peal.

The Freshman class favored reten-
tion of the prohibition law, being the

only one to do so. They cast 106
against and 66 for. repeal. The other
classes gave majorities for repeal: the
seniors, 41 to 28; juniors, 67 to 44, and
the sophomores, 81 to 52.

Band Plays Popular
Marches Over Radio

The Davidson College radio program
Was again presented last Wednesday
night when twenty-five members of
the concert band played several very
popular marches, Grier Martin, alumni
secretary, announced the program, and
Mr. James C. Pfohl conducted the

band.

The program was opened with the
playing of “O Davidson,” and this was
followed *by “ Hall of Fame,” a concert

march by Olivadoti. The band then
played “Men of Ohio,” by Fillmore,
and “ Cheerio,” Edmund Franko Gold-
man’s latest march which has been so
popular at the football games.

Miss Angelia Morrison of the Jun-
ior League of Charlotte then made a
short talk on the Citadel-Davidson
game which was to be played last Sat-
urday on Richardson Field, which was
sponsored by the Junior League.

Following this, the band played “ El
Capitan” by Sousa, and the “ Chicago
World's Fair Centennial March,” by
Mader. At the conclusion of the last
piece the time limit was up, and the
band was unable to close with “O Da-
vidson.”

Tonight the program will consist of
several selections by the college
quartet, composed of Dave McLain,
Hubert Morris, Buddy Robinson, and
Frank Tucker.

Dr. A. Currie Speaks
On Peace Possibility

Dr. Archibald Currie, head of the
Political Science Department, was the
principal speaker at the Armistice Day
chapel program, which was sponsored
by the International Relations Club.
The subject of Dr. Currie’s talk was
“The Outlook of World Peace Today.”

Dr. J. M. McConnell, faculty advisor

to the club, gave a brief history of the
Relations Club, and
stated that there are at present about

International

six hundred clubs in the various col-

leges and universities. Lyman Clardy,

president of the Davidson Chapter of
the I. R. C.,, read appropriate selections
from different portions of the Bible

commanding the world to peace.

“The mental attitude of war among
nations is the most essential factor to
the future peace of the world,” was
the key statement in Dr. Currie’s talk,
He began by describing that famous
Armistice fifteen years ago, which
came like a bolt out of the blue to
a startled world. Since then, however,
there has been an unusual amount of
pessimism in regard to the future of
world peace. The nations are more
highly armed today than in 1916, but
optimism for the preservance of peace
is based throughout on man’s change
in his mental attitude toward war.

Since 1922 there have been sixty-four
states of the world which have as-
sembled to discuss reduction of arma-
ments, and, although these meetings
have largely failed, they may be taken
as an indication that man is pre-occu-
pying himself about the maintenance
of peace. A new note was sounded
when the leaders of the nations sub-
scribed to the doctrine that moral dis-
armament must take precedent to ma-
terial disarmament. And upon these
encouraging signs, Professor Currie
based his optimism for future peace.
