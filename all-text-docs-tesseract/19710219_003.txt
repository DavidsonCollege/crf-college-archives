Script Shackles ‘A Case Of Libel’

A REVIEW

“A Case of Libel,’’ now

It did not take Loughridge
long to distinguish himself

grinning smugly.

‘Miscellany’ Achieves High Quality

By DICK ANDERSON
Associate Editor

“Miscellany’’ is a noun
that well describes the con-
tents of the Davidson. liter
ary,review, but its adjecti-
val. form.is by no means ap
plicable to their quality: in
this issue. '

Perhaps the least effective
parts of the magazine are
the last two articles, by Ro-
bert S. Lennox, Instructor of
Humanities and Education,
and J. G. Holland, assistant
professor of English, both at
Davidson.

The first part of Len-
nox’ two-part “essay on
“‘Synergetic Man’’ (the se-
cond part is to appear in
the Spring issue) is slightly
incomprehensible, if erudite.
And Holland's two poetry re-
views are less reviews than
annotated quotations from
his subjects’ works.

It is a measure of 'the high
quality of the entire maga-
zine that even the weakest
selections are interesting,
though a little confusing,
‘and once one has read the
second part of Lennox’ es-

say it should become clear- |

er.

Asseciate Professor of
Music Wilmer WH. Welsh
handles with poignant sen-
sitivity and skill the tale of
a serious modern composer
who feels himself supersed-
ed by the popular music of
today, and in so doing points
up his personal dilemma a&
a composer.

Seamus Finn and Ronald
Jones, .both Californian
writers, succeed brilliantly
in the O. Henry genre. Their

surprise endings fit superb-
ly into the story lines yet
have all the impact of the
best such ‘‘short shorts."

The dialect written by. the
latter in his ‘‘The One Peso
Slut” combines | plausibility
with easy readability. The
West Indies dialect in ‘'Sey-
mour Martin’s ‘‘Obeah"’ is
more dificult to figure out
but rewards study (I have
yet to decipher ‘‘oono rass,”’
though).

Seniors V. Cullum Rogers’
satite on Thomas Wolfe, by
content a re-telling of the
episode of ‘Brer Rabbit and
the. brier patch from. the
Uncle Remus cycle, juxta-
poses that earthy story with
Wolfe's cloud-borne style so
effectively as to reduce both
to hilarious absurdity.

Pakistani Mobashir Gala-
huddin and Michael W. Febb
both catch glimpses of more
tragic existences; impres-
sionistic brush strokes by the

former depict a death in the
desert delicately, while the
latter whips the undead horse
of religious fantaticism in
“If Thy Right Hand Offend
Thee...” >

Bill Rolland imitates the
Pensees of Pasc in four
‘Daily Meditations, ' but the
imitation is not unworthy,
for he provides deft insights
in a variety of modes. |

The poetry in the magazine
is rather -more difficult to
evaluate. Certainly Emilie
Glen in ,‘Broth for the Bro-
thel’’ and Terry Stokes in
“The Answer" juggle words
well. I also especially liked
the first poem, ‘‘Test Pat-
tern'’ by O. Howard ‘Winn,
which deals immediately
with Mr. Universe and more
subtly with. Marshall McLu-
han {I think).

The poetry selections do
seem characterized by a
certain sameness, however.

Finally there is a photo-

Loughridge- was the only
player to show any traces of

. character transition over the

year or so that the plot cov-
ers. Kind, but businesslike,
his first scenes have about
them the delicate touch of
lost youth and a life gone
sterile. He is last night's
campfire. He is a withered
grapefruit. He is terrific.
Gradually, the Corcoran
case gets the blood (citric
acid?) flowing. Lough-
ridge’s Sloane hits his stride
early, and never loses the
pace,

Wright's handling of. the
villain's attorney suffered
by comparison. His conclud-
ing remarks to the jury —
his last real lines — were
exceptionally well handled.
Wright captured the smooth,
used-car selling technique
demanded by the lines. His
ability so demonstrated, it
was disappointing to see

_Wright make so much less

use of ‘it in the early going.

Dave Bradley gave the au-
dience a believable Dennis
Corcoran—no small accomp-
lishment, given the melo-
dramatic tendencies of the
script.

Added use of Bradley's
nicely done ‘frustrated
strength’’ might have help-
ed. The scenes with Corco

tures of the very old. Unfor-
tunately I fear that this stu-
dy tells more about Higgins
than about Ireland, but it is
nonetheless well done.

were often adequate, but
the” Corcoran couple was
hampered by a relationship
that might as well have been
nephew—maiden aunt. —

Carl Nordstrom appeared
as \Blackhearted Boyd Ben-
dix, a phrase turning Agnew
of other days. His interpre-
tation of the character was
from the first exactly what
it should be in only the last
couple of scenes.

It would be better for the
play if the audience could
gradually realize what a
pathetic, though dangerous
man this Bendix is. Nord-
strom's ‘Bendix, however,
began and ended just a lit-
tle too ludicrously.

Predictably, the stage ac-
tion picked up with the
short-role appearances of
Peter Lutken and Cullum
Rogers, as a Scottish colonel
and editor Fred Alston, re-
spectively. (Lutken,  parti-
cularly, was a breath of
fresh air when -a dragging
play most needed it. The
other cast members could,

possibly his best physical
performance since ‘Don't

production). Rogers as (Als-

George WMraughon, as
Sloane's major partner in
the firm, ran into too many
obstacles for his perform-
ance to ever pick up a dra-
matic rhythm. ‘Foremost of
these obstacles was a set of
lines including all the worst
of a poor melodramatic lot.
