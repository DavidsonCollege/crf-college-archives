One afternoon several months
ago, Mr. DeWitt Wallace and
Mr. Edward H. Little were hav-
ing a quiet lunch together when
the topic of conversation turned
to colleges in which both men
were interested. They agreed
that each one would give $1,000
to the college of the other's
choice.

Mr. Little chose Davidson Col-
lege to receive Mr. Wallace’s
gift, and Mr. Wallace chose
Macalester College in St. Paul,
Minnesota. to receive Mr. Lit-
tle’s gift.

A short time after the gifts
had been made, Mr. Little
learned that Mr. Wallace was
going to add the necessary
amount to establish a $5.000
scholarship at Macalester in the
name of Edward H. Little.

Mr. Little then. proceeded to

a devoted and true friend of
the college.

Mr. Wallace is the man who
in 1822 chanced his all on a
magazine designed to present a
variety of articles condensed
from leading magazines—THE
READER'S DIGEST.

It is understandable that this
sixty-one year old founder. edi-
tor, and publisher of the world’s
largest magazine should choose
Macalester College to receive
Mr. Little's gift. Mr. Wallace's
father taught Greek and Old
English there and was later
honored with the presidency of
the co-educational institution
founded in 1853. Wallace him-
self attended Macalester for two
years before going to the Uni-
versity of California.

‘Mr. Little's name has long
been familiar here at Davidson.
This seventy-seven year old na-
tive of Mecklenburg County was
given an honorary doctorate in
1953 and is Honorary Vice-

| John Nix, a rising senior
from Tucker, Georgia, was ap-
pointed judge of the Court of
Control for next year by the
student council at their most
recent meeting. John succeeds
Phil Lewis as judge.

Also selected to serve as
Court members were Pat
Henderson, Harold Westervelt,
and Craig Wall, rising seniors;
George Hart and Larry McNeil,
rising juniors; and Scott Lacy
and Jerry Cole, rising sopho-
mores. Wall, Hart, and McNeil
have had previous experience
serving on the Court of Control.

lection as judge, said that “i

further the excellent work done

trol.

vision and improvement will be
among the many questions

‘Couldn't Believe’

(Continued From Page One)

t am deeply grateful to
the Trustees of Davidson
College for the confidence
they have expressed in me
by selecting me as presi-
dent of the college. | shall
do everything in my power
to justify their faith in mé.

Davidson ranks high as a
tiberal arts college for men.
There is every reason to
believe that it will continue
to improve its service in
this area by providing quali-
ty education in a Christian
environment to its students.

This objective can be ac-
complished only through a
dedicated and competent
faculty and staff which is
adequately compensated
and provided with the
necessary equipment and fa-
cilities.

it will be my purpose to
see that these essential
needs of the college are
provided and that David:

cational world is main-
tained and strengthened.
