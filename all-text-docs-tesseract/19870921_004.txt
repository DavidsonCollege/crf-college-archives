Davidson student arrested in drug bust

By ED PATTE

During the waning days of the
‘1987 spring term, officials from
the Mecklenburg County Police
Department and the State Bureau
of Investigations arrested and
charged Davidson College’
freshman John Brinkman with
two counts of possession of illegal
substances and one count of sale
and delivery of marijuana to an
undercover officer. .

- Earlier during the spring term
an undercover State Bureau of In-
vestigations Officer, posing as the

hometown boyfriend of a David-
son student, approached and pur-
chased marijuana from Brinkman.

Beyond Davidson

With this evidence in hand S.B.1
and Mecklenburg County officers
obtained a-search warrant that
later led to Brinkman’s charges of
possession.

Brinkman’s problems with the
use of controlled substances dur-
ing the fall and winter terms of
1986-1987 were _ originally
brought to the attention of his hall
counselors Bob Boyd and Jim
Earle. Brinkman was advised to

attend counseling sessions pro-

vided by Davidson College, but
did not comply. .

When Brinkman’s soliciting
of illegal substances was disco-
vered during spring term, the mat-
ter was brought directly to Dean of

Students Will Terry. In com-
pliance with his drug policy, Dean
Terry alerted the Mecklenburg
County Police Department.

The arrest of Brinkman for
selling marijuana demonstrates
the distinction Terry makes in
dealing with drug pushers as op-
posed to drug users.

“In a conversation with the
Mecklenburg County District At-
torney I have his assurance that he
will press felony charges against
any individual found selling drugs
on this campus. I have also con-
tacted the Mecklenburg County
Police and asked them to cooper-
ate with any agency to seek out
any person selling drugs on this

campus. I will not hesitate to re-
port any suspected pushers on
campus or in the town.”

Terry’s drug policy follows a
different track when confronted
with drug users.

“We will still seek to deal with
the user therapeutically rather
than punitively, if the user will
take the matter seriously. The
measures we are taking have the
explicit endorsement of the Board
of Trustees and the President.”

After spending a night in jail,
Brinkman was released on bond.
Although originally charged with
three felony counts for his sale and
possession of illegal substances,
Brinkman agreed to serve time at a

Brinkman is now serving pro-
bation for the sale and delivery of
marijuana to an undercover of-
ficer, but if at any time during his
probationary period heé> violates
his parole he will have to serve out
his two year sentence.

Brinkman currently resides in
Milwaukee and is applying for en-
trance to the University of Wis-
consin. According to the Dean of
Students’ Office he is under inde-
finite suspension and for one year
is completely ineligible for read-
mission to Davidson.

Aquino orders cabinet resignation; spotlight on Bork

By KATHERINE PRICE
Headlining events Sept. 10-17:

Around the world — Phil-
lipine President Aquino dismissed
Finance Secretary Ongpin on Fri-
day. Aquino also accepted the res-
ignation of Vice-President Laurel
as Foreign Affairs Secretary. The
departures of these two men fol-
low earlier dismissals by Aquino
of her 26-member cabinet in the
wake of an unsuccessful coup at-
tempt led by Col. Gregorio Hon-

Amid tensions in the Persian
Gulf, United Nations Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar
traveled first to Iran and then to
Iraq in efforts to persuade the na-
tions’ leaders to participate in a
cease-fire. Iran and Iraq have been
at war for 7 years. Secretary-Gen-
eral de Cuellar’s visit produced
few, if any, immediate results.

Recent tanker wars in the Per-
sian Gulf threaten to escalate into

worldwide conflict if the fighting
continues. The U.S. began escort-
ing Kuwaiti ships in July to pro-
tect Persian Gulf shipping inter-
ests. The reflagging of Kuwaiti
ships under the American flag has
been interpreted as U.S. support
for Iraq in its war against Iran.
Other nations, such as Britain and
France, have also become in-
volved in the Persian Gulf by
helping to detect mines allegedly
planted by Iran.

At a meeting in Montreal this
week, twenty-four nations signed

an international accord this week -

in an effort to protect the earth’s
ozone layer. The montreal meet-
ing focused on the dangerous ef-
fects fluorocarbons have upon tlie
earth’s atmosphere.

Across the nation — U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz
and Soviet Foreign Minister
Edouard Shevardnadze met in
Washington this week, generating

hopes that the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. may be moving closer
to a ban on medium-range nuclear
weapons in Europe. While U.S.
officials continue to state that a
summit meeting between U.S.
President Reagan and Soviet
Leader Gorbachev has not been
set, reporters seem optimistic that
a superpower summit will occur.
Soviet news sources reported that
a timetable for Soviet withdrawal
of troops from Afghanistan also
was discussed.

Senate Republicans ended
their 4-month filibuster of major
arms control legislation on Fri-
day, as the Democrat-controlled
Senate seemed assured of victory.
Senate members anxiously await!
the results of negotiations be-
tween U.S. Secretary of State
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minis-
ter Shevardnadze on arms control
matters.

Supreme Court nominee
Robert Bork becomes the focus of

congressional attention this week
as his nomination goes before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
Bork, who was nominated by
President Reagan, is well-known
for his controversial views of
court decisions involving abor-
tion, women’s rights, and civil
rights. Bork’s critics cite his op-
position to the court’s decision in
Roe v. Wade (which legalized
abortion) as an example of how
his constitutional interpretations
will affect U.S. law. Bork’s nomi-
nation could be a victory for
Reagan as his presidential term
nears its end.

Leading the opposition to
Bork’s nomination is Democratic
presidential candidate Joseph
Biden of Delaware. As Judicial
Committee chairman Biden will
be enjoying national visibility,
which will put pressure upon him
to perform well in the hearings.
Biden has recently been accused
of plagiarizing in his political

speeches, and he tried to dismiss
such claims in a news conference
on Thursday.

Another. Reagan nominee, .
William Sessions of Texas, was
unanimously approved by the

_Senate Judiciary Committee for

the position of FBI Director. Ses-
sions was nominated to replace
William Webster, who left the
FBI position to become head of
the CIA.

An agreement was reached by
House leaders to give Nicaraguan
rebels $3.5 million in nonlethal -
aid. The proposal is expected to be
approved by the Senate, but to be
vetoed by President Reagan.

Pope John Paul II paid his sec-
ond visit to the U.S. this week.

_ The pope toured the southern

U.S., delivering impassioned
pleas for faith and commitment.
The pope remained firm in his op-
position to female Catholic
priests, divorce, and homosexual-
ity.

cattmeed from page |
Court houses with] initial equip-
_ment and furnishings.”
__ Nevertheless, most of the
. items Emanon auctioned are
found under the heading of Frater-
nity Responsibility, and therefore
Stephens and others apparently
believed the kitchen equipment
was theirs to sell. Stephens con-
sulted both the Business Office
and Comptroller’s office before
the auction to determine the own-
ership of property.
According to Gail Hoke,
Business Office Staff Secretary,
Stephens approached her about
-the-auction-and she provided him
with the written guidelines which:
she stated were very clear about
the ownership of house property.
Stephens concluded from these
guidelines that Emanon owned the
kitchen supplies. Stephens said
that before the auction he tried to
contact Doenges several times to
inquire if Kappa Sigma would like
to purchase any of the kitchen
equipment -but he was unsuccess-
ful.
‘The money raised by Ema-
_ non’s auction paid for a weekend

beach ine to Kiawah Island for the
house and a “very sizable” dona-
tion to Hollis Moore, the house’s
cook. The remaining funds are
being contributed to the Christian
Children’s Fund. |

The most obvious conse-
quence of Emanon’s actions was
to force a delay in the opening of
Kappa Sigma’s kitchen until the
fraternity was able to restock the
auctioned equipment.

The second consequence,
which is more serious, is that the
school will have to replace the
kitchen equipment, a costDoenges

estimated at $10,000.00. The fact |

that Kappa Sig had to delay its
meals was simply a minor incon-
venience, according to Doenges.
Emanon was the third house in re-
cent years to fail and change hands
and the first one to have this type
of problem.

Dean Terry is confident that:

this will not happen again as the
guidelines for Patterson Court
houses are being revised and made
more clear, and because he will

“padlock any house from now on

that closes.”

Fee Continued from page 1

recalls that there were “approxi-
mately 200 cars on campus
throughout last year that were not
properly registered.”

' Furthermore campus security
had a problem last year with unre-
gistered, run-down automobiles.
In one case a car with no engine
was simply left on campus after
the end of the school year. This
car had to be towed away and the
cost was absorbed by the school
since the owner’s identity was un-
known.

A second reason behind the
new fee was the issue of fairness
to the Davidson students who do

not keep a car on campus. As Sut- _

ton points out; “the cost of parking
should be placed on the shoulders
of those students who keep cars on
campus, not simply every stu-
dent.”

Finally, both Hughes and Sut- -
ton, state that Davidson College

was one of the few colleges in the
country, if not the only one, that
did not charge a parking registra-
tion fee.

Although many students think
that the $30 fee is too high, Sutton
and Hughes maintain that the fig-
ure is the lower average from a

survey they conducted of parking
fees at private schools around the
country.

Students, as may be expected,
are upset about the initiation of the
registration fee. As one junior
pointed out, it was another rising
cost of Davidson College similar
to the significant increases in tui-
tion for the past two years.

Many students, however, see
no problem with having to pay for
parking as long as the funds gener-
ated are used to improve the park-
ing situation. Even so, they were
angered that there has yet to be an
explanation of how this new reve-
nue is to be spent.

____ Junior David Ray states,—“T
think it is a large sum especially
since there was no reason given
for the increase, and I don’t know

. where it is going.”

Some members of the SGA
Senate also seemed distressed
concerning the revenue appropri-

ations. One SGA member stated

that last spring, when the Senate
reluctantly passed’ the resolution
for a flat parking fee, they were

- told the money would be appropri-
-ated to the development of park-

ing on campus. Yet the money

placed in the general funds, a
budget area which, the SGA
member states, “is not earmarked
for any specific item.”

When questioned about this
situation, Hughes noted that in
years past all revenue generated
from parking and security has
been placed into general funds.
Sutton also confirmed that the
money is going into the general
funds, but said that it would be ap-"
propriated to parking develop-
ment when it begins. Unfortu-
nately, due to the complexity of
the building plans for the new dor-
mitories and the sports complex,
specific action to improve parking
at-Davidson_is uncertain at this.
time.

Sutton emphasized that he is .
sympathetic to the students’ needs
and complaints and indicated that
he will meet this week with the Di-
rector of Facilities Planning,
Grover Meetze, to discuss plans
for using the registration fee reve-
nue for much-needed parking irn-
provements.

For frustrated students, how-
ever, the new parking fee appears
to mark a seemingly unending and
escalating trend towards a more
