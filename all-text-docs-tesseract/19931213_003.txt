THE DAVIDSONIAN

Carols, candles &
Mrs. Claus

By Court McBryde ~

Davidson Students gathered
on the lawn in front of Chambers
under a starry sky, on a cold De-
cember 7 at 10:00 p.m., for a Christ-
mas celebration sponsored by the
Union.

Some students started their
celebrating early with old time fa-
vorite showings of “You’rea Good
Man, Charlie Brown” and “The
Grinch that Stole Christmas,”
which were shown in the 900 Room
of the Union.

Hot apple cider and cookies
welcomed students as they flocked
to the lawn. Elves handed out
candles to students who took their
position in the horse-shoe shaped
ring facing Chambers.

The Davidson Choir led ev-
eryone in Christmas carols after
Davidson’s Chaplin, Robert Spach,
read the Christmas story.

Santa repelled down Cham-
bers, avoiding last year’s run in
with the tree. However, this year
Davidson’s Christmas was graced
with the presence of Mrs. Claus.
Decked out in her attire, Mrs. Claus
followed Santa Claus down Cham-
bers as students yelled andcheered.

Mrs. Claus’s appearance celebrates
the 20 years of womenat Davidson.

One female sophomore
thought Mrs. Claus’s appearance
showed “good representation of
the females at Davidson.”

The singing began to wind
down, and on the last verse of
“Silent Night, Holy Night,” the
two trees on either side of Cham-
bers lit up full of lights while
DCPC’s bells rang in the back-
ground.

On Friday afternoon, the F-
Crew went down to Davidson EI-
ementary school and sang Christ-
mas songs and visited with the
children.

Christmas with the Unioncon-
tinued through the weekend. The
Union Outpost hosted a Blue Grass
Christmas, featuring Charlotte’s
own Peppercorn Lane on Friday
from 9 p.m.-12 a.m.

On Saturday, December 12,
the Union held a Campus Commu-
nity Christmas Party. From 2p.m.-
4 p.m., the community gathered to
see Santa and the Grinch, sing car-
ols, make ornaments, play games,
and enjoy Christmas cheer. Each
room in the Union had a particular

Christmas at Davidson.

theme of Christmas.

Sophomore F-Crew Chair
Rosie Molinary commented the
party “was a way for the commu-
nity and students to bond before
the holidays. It is something posi-
tive Davidson can do for the com-
munity.”

The Christmas festivities con-
cluded with Vespers on Sunday
night at 7:15.

Program bridges Davidson and J.C Smith

By Susan Warren

This semester Davidson and
Johnson C. Smith College created
a joint seminar, “Community
Building: Charlotte,” involving
students from both colleges.

The seminar enrolled 13 stu-
dents from Davidson and 8 from
Johnson C. Smith and was created
by Davidson professors Clark Ross

and Janet Shannon and Johnson C.
Smith professors Bob Sulek and
Maxine Moore.

The course was designed to
provide the enrolled students “with
perspective and understanding of
urban issues.”

The seminar consisted of lec-
tures led by professors of both
schools. Due to discussion groups

as well as the lectures, the students
from both schools have developed
friendships.

Janet Shannon, assistant pro-
fessor of sociology spoke of the

program: “Students, through ob- -

servation have opportunities to see
what is going on, and learn from
their readings the theories and poli-
cies behind the reality.”

Ramp makes treasures of VAC aecessibie

By Katherine Hash

Aramp across the street from
the Visual Arts Center will soon
make its treasures more accessible
to the handicapped and disabled.
Physical Plant is currently in the
process of building the ramp which
is located next to Cunningham to
be completed over the holiday
break. The project was initiated
by the Facilities Planning Com-
mittee which is responsible for
recognizing needs on campus and
establishing priorities for projects.

According to committee
member John Kelton, the authori-
zation for the construction of the
ramp is indicative of the high pri-
ority which the committee has as-
signed to improving accessibility
on Davidson’s campus, not just
for Davidson’s own handicapped
students but for alumni and other
visitors.

Other recent projects have in-
cluded the installation of electric
doors--which can be opened by
remote control in Little, Watts,
Cannon, and Sentelle--and the con-
struction of ramps.

These enable those in wheel-
chairs to cross streets on the cam-
pus side of Concord road near the
Union and on Main Street across
from UCB.

cant progress which has been made

but realizes that it will be a long

time before Davidson is as an at-
tractive an option for handicapped
students. Unlike St. Andrews Col-
lege in Larinburg, Davidson does
not recruit handicapped students
on the basis of the school’s acces-
sibility and academic programs
designed to meet specific handi-
cap needs.

While handicap recruitment
programs are not a part of the
college’s plans at this point, the
college does want to make itself an
attractive option for all qualified
students who are interested.

Davidson sophomore Cynthia
Luckie and senior Stephen Faller
both feel that the college has been
evely cooperative in accommodat-

ing there special needs” but agree
that there is still a lot which could
be done.

Luckie met with Kelton just
last week to propose the construc-
tion of a ramp for Chambers, a
project which has not yet been
approved due to concerns about
disrupting the aesthetic beauty of
Chambers. She currently uses the
inconvenient and time-consuming
lift in the back of Chambers.

Faller identified the dorms
“down the hill” and the Patterson

‘Court houses, except the Union

Outpost, asinaccessible. He would
like to see changes in these build-
ings, additional banisters in Cham-
bers, and wheelchair space in Love.
