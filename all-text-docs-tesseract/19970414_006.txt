Proposition 209 to be upheld

A federal appeals court panel,
siding with opponents of affirma-
tive action, upheld California’s
voter-approved ban on preferences
based on gender and race last week.

The decision overturned a
lower court’s ruling of the law as
being unconstitutional.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, a three-judge panel, de-
clared there was “no doubt” the law
was constitutional.

The initiative was passed last
December by 54% of California’s
voters. It bars preferential treat-
ment in public hiring, contracting,
and education.

The new decision is set to take
effect in three weeks, but affirma-
tive action supporters plan to ask it
be delayed while an appeal is being
processed.

President Clinton did not sup-
port Proposition 209 and stated that
if states are precluded from taking
special measures to help disadvan-
taged people, “I think it will be a
mistake.”

He says, “I think we’ ll all have
to regroup and find new ways to
achieve the same objective.”

The judges emphasized that the

equal protection clause in the 14th
amendment was intended to end
government discrimination based
on race. They said it would be para-
doxical if California voters had vio-
lated the clause by requiring all
people to be treated equally and
barring any preference based on
race or sex.

“After all,” the ruling said, “the
goal of the 14th Amendment, to
which the nation continues to as-
pire, is a political system in which
race no longer matters.”

ACLU Legal Director Mark
Rosenbaum called the decision a
“grave disappointment,” saying it
is “obviously and dramatically in-
compatible with decades of main-
stream Supreme Court decisions
guaranteeing women and minori-
ties equal participation in the politi-
cal process.”

The new decision is likely to
help anti-affirmative action cam-
paigns in other states.

Washington, Florida, Arizona,
Colorado, Ohio, and Michigan all
have started or are ready to put
similar amendments on their bal-
lots.

California governor Pete Wil-

son (R) said the appeals court had
“flatly rejected the Orwellian rea-
soning that says a ban on discrimi-
nation is an act of discrimination.”

California state universities
will have to start reassessing their
policies of admission soon, how-
ever.

The governor has indicated
higher education as a specific area
that needs to be corrected soon.

Most legal analysts believe that
this case will not stop until it reaches
the Supreme Court.

The first judge who blocked
implementation of the law was ap-
pointed by President Jimmy Carter.

The three judges who said it
should stand were appointed by
Presidents Reagan and Bush.

Both sides of the issue are pas-
sionate, wealthy, and organized.
They spent millions in an advertis-
ing war during last year’s elections.

Garret Epps, a University of
Oregon law professor says, “We
will soon find out where the Su-
preme Court stands on this whole
issue, whether the equal protection
clause will be read to some color
blind commandment.”

Opposing sides talk, fight in Zaire

The opposing sides of the six month civil war in Zaire talked in South
Africa last week to discuss how to end the rebel uprising that has
threatened to topple the one party state of President Mobutu. The two
sides did not agree to a cease-fire but issued acommunique that would
have to be negotiated before any settlement could be reached. They
also indicated that severe problems in the governmental structures
would need to be addressed. Both sides agree that Zaire’s territorial
sovereignty should be kept intact. But, both the sides have set up
different capitals. The rebels are in Goma and the government is in
Kinshasa, effectively dividing the country.

3 Palestinians killed in Hebron

Another round of ferocious clashes broke out in the West Bank last

week, leaving three Palestinians dead and adding to growing evidence:
that a violent uprising has resumed aside the deadlocked Israeli-

Palestinian peace talks. Israeli soldiers fired some of the shots once a

Jewish settler started throwing rocks after he said a Palestinian had

attacked him. Political contact grows less and less between the sides

as the optimism from the 1993 Oslo accords wanes. Many are calling

on increased American and international pressure to get the peace

talks moving again.

I.R.S. thought to loose billions each year

As the tax deadline looms closer and closer many independent
analysts believe the Internal Revenue Service looses up to $200 billion
each year. Some blame the inefficiency of the bureaucracy, which has
yet to update most of its computers. Others say it is due to a complex

and long 9,000 page tax code that should be simplified and rid of
loopholes.

Helms allows CW treaty to move closer to ratification

Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has moved to allow U.S. ratification of
an international treaty that would ban chemical weapons. He still
thinks, “It is not global, it is not verifiable, it is not constitutional, and
it will not work.” But, he is bowing to pressure from international
organizations and within his own party to at least let the ban have a
try. Supporters of the bill say the U.S. could easily manufacture
chemical weapons quickly if needed, and that the treaty would
decrease the amounts made in times of peace and reduce the environ-
mental risks of having the chemicals stored in warehouses.
