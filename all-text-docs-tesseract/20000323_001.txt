College hauled to court

By Micuaet J. Kruse
Editor Emeritus

Davidson is fighting for its way of lifé in
a court of law.

Junior John Powell and his parents filed
a law suit against the college last November
after a pair of late-night scuffles on Oct. 14
led to Code of Responsibility sanctions.

The Powells are charging Davidson with
improper application of its own Code, bias
due to a previous incident, and overly severe
sanctions — in the words of the Powells’
attorneys, the failure “to provide a fair and
impartial judicial and review mechanism.”

A Judicial Committee chaired by
Assoicate Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano
levied four sanctions following a hearing on
Oct. 21 — suspension for the remainder of the
fall semester, social probation this spring,
required alcohol and anger management coun-
seling, and restitution for any medical costs
resulting from the incidents.

Powell has or is currently in the process
of satisfying all sanctions — all of them, that

is, except the suspension.

The Powells’ attorneys, Lynwood P.
Evans and John M. Martin based in the
family’s hometown of Greenville, N.C.,
fought fora temporary restraining order—and
got one from Superior Court Judge Clifton
W. Everett of Pitt County — allowing Powell
to remain on campus and in class through the
end of last semester.

I don’t want to see other people get stepped
on by a system that’s not fair.”

Davidson’s administrators and attorneys
are trying to uphold that system.

“We fight this because this is the Honor
Code and Code of Responsibility,” Dean of
Students Tom Shandley said in his office last
week. “It’s absolutely essential to what this
institution is about.

At stake at this point are Powell’s grades
from the fall. He wants them. Davidson has
them and will not release them.

For both sides, though, there’s also the
matter of principle.

“T’m sure there are people out there that
think what I’m doing isn’t the right thing, that
I’m attacking the institution,” Powell said in
arecent interview. “But this isn’t just for me.

“To have a court come into what is
typically a college-run procedure and some-
how instruct us how we should run our disci-
plinary procedures would be ahuge change in
precedent.”

The current legal battle stems from two
separate physical altercations in and outside
the Kappa Alpha fraternity house on Patterson
Court in the wee hours of Oct. 14.

According to police reports, witness state-
ments, and court documents obtained by The
Davidsonian, Powell broke senior Robert
Lindenberg’s ankle by pushing him to the
floor at approximately 2:00'a.m. Some 90
minutes later Powell joined sophomore Nick
Grainger in a fight against sophomore
Schuyler Hoffman.

Neither Lindenberg nor Hoffman pressed
charges, although Hoffman filed a police
report shortly after 4:30 that morning

Powell contacted both Lindenberg and
Hoffman the next day and offered to pay for
Lindenberg’s medical expenses.

“Don’t worry about compensating me
more,” Lindenberg wrote in an Oct. 25 e-mail
to Powell. “This will help enough. Anyways,
I hope you work out your sanctions with the
school and I will see you around soon.”

“He’s friendly,” Lindenberg said of
Powell when contacted last week. “I don’t

enjoy talking to him. But it’s not a big deal.”
