Shorter shows enhanced maturity

By JEFFREY BROWN
Wayne Shorter: Adam’ s Apple
BLUE NOTE 84232

Wayne Shorter stands as a pivotal fig-
ure in the history of contemporary Amer-
ican music. His work with trumpeter
Miles Davis during the 1960's led to the
birth of jazz fusion, a controversial at-
tempt to broaden the scope of mainstream
jazz through the introduction of electrical
instruments and rock rhythms. The
Davis/Shorter collaboration produced the
famous (or infamous if you prefer)
Bitches Brew in the late 60’s. This work
set the stage for the entire jazz fusion
movement.

Shorter, along with keyboardist Joe
Zawinal co-founded Weather Report in
the early seventies, at its time the premier
voice of fusion jazz. One should not,
however, blame Shorter for the prolifera-
tion of mediocre fusion that tainted the
jazz market during the 1970's. Shorter

has remained a consummate, engaging
jazz artist since his early work with Art
Blakely’s Jazz Messengers, and never
more convincingly than on his solo re-
leases for the Blue Note label. One of the
more notable of these releases is the 1964
Adam's Apple.

Recently re-issued by the re-or-
ganized Blue Note label, Adam's Apple
displays all of the qualities for which
Shorter is justly famous: leanness of
playing and an inspired compositional
sensibility.

‘“Adam’s Apple,” the title selection
bobs and weaves lightheartedly, recal-
ling the honk-tonk nature of the most
identifiable blues melodies. Shorter’s
tenor solo darts and jabs playfully reveal! -
ing an understated sense of humor.

“502 Blues (Drinkin’ and Driven)” is
the only song on the album not composed
by Shorter. The piece opens with the lyri-
cal, flowing lines of pianist Herbie Han-

cock, followed by Shorter’s moody,
haunting expression of the melody. Com-
poser Jimmy Rowles has created the per-
fect vehicle for Shorter’s unique improvi-
sational ability.

“El Goucho,” a wonderful Shorter
original, makes extensive use of the do-
rian mode. “El Goucho,” like so many
Shorter compositions reveals the artist’s
affinity for modal structures, a form in
which he excels. The tune recalls a bossa
nova, though its unique chord progres-
sions elevate the tune above the tried and
proven bossa nova formula.

Side two opens with “Footprints,” a
stunning display of elegant simplicity,
and one of Shorter’s most popular modal
efforts. Reggie Worman’s clean, crisp
bass line adds to the lean yet haunted feel
of the work. Shorter’s fascination with
moody, dark themes was to continue,
reaching a plateau on his Night Dreamer
album, and the now classic Speak No

“Teru,” an interesting if not outstand-
ing ballad, displays Shorter’s ability to
create rich tonal textures through the use
of lush, dense chromaticism. The song
fails, however, to move or inspire the lis-
tener in the profound way that most of
Shorter’s ballads do.

The album ends with “Chief Crazy
Horse,” a driving, energetic piece that
finds drummer Joe Chambers at the top of
his form. Shorter and Chambers seem to
echo one another, each feeding off of the
other’s intensity. The song reaches its
climax in a fury of saxophone runs and
pulsating drum beats, creating a vivid
sense of perpetual motion.

Adam’ s Apple represents an indispen-
sible addition to any Shorter collection.
one can find in the work an enhanced
maturity on the artist’s part, both com-
positionally and instrumentally.
