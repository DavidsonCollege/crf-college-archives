11: 12 a.m. The first witness the
prosection called was the defen-
dant. Schmozowsky was asked to
explain the events of April 14. Joe
said that he was leaving class in
good spirits. He started down the
stairs when the person in front of
him, Jass, stopped to talk to some-
one further down the stairs. Joe
said that he asked Jass to move and
when ‘he did not, he called Jass
“fatso”, then walked around him.
Joe said that he was angry with
Jass for blocking the stairwell, but
did not intend the “Move it” to be
interpreted as a threat. If Jass did
not move, Schmozowsky said that
he certainly would have done no
harm to Jass. The prosecution
_ asked Schmozowsky if he was
aware of Hugh’s weight.
Schmozowsky said that he was.
Patton deftly asked if Schmozow-
sky had called Jass a “fatso” or a
“lard ass.” The defendant claimed
to have uttered the former slur.
The prosecution then called Hugh
Jass to the stand. Jass was asked to
recount the events as he saw them
on April 14. Jass said that he was

walking down the stairs of Cham-
bers on his way to Wendy’s to take
advantage of the Superbar. He was
walking slowly, he said, because
his doctor had advised him that
with his current weight he should
take stairs slowly. Jass said he
could feel the anger and resent-
ment behind him because
Schmozowsky was very close to
him, cursing under his breath. Jass
said that he then “stopped for a
breather” and to talk to a girl who
had said “hi” to him. “Schmozow-
sky then became enraged and vio-
lent”, testified Jass. “He screamed
at me like a mad man to move my
‘lard ass’, and when I, in shock,
didn’t move, he stormed around
me and threw me the most horrible
threatening glance. If we had not
been in Chambers, then I think he
might have whipped out a bowie
knife and scalped me.” The prose-
cuuion asked Jass if he had felt
threatened by being told to “move
it.” Jass responded that the words
were inflected like a question, so
he had been afraid to respond for
fear of incurring Schmozowsky’s
“wrath.” “How did it feel to be
called ‘lard ass’”, asked Plauché?
“It made me feel simply awful,
like my ass was different than eve-

but he maintained that marijuana is clearly the lesser of the two evils. He
referred io how marijuana has been a positive and disorganizing in-
flunece on Davidson athletics. As we all know, Davidson’s hackey
sackers and frisbee golfers have put the college on the athletic map. No
one will ever forgethow Sports [Illustrated captured the calm expression
on hacker Rob Ukrop’s face in mid twist and toke.

As for Belk Arcna, Kuykendall noted that it has finally been put to
good use. The Grateful Dead along with many other hip bands play there
on a regular basis. And with Davidson being a marijuana free campus
in the truc sense of the word free now, all sorts of “heads” pack the arena
in search of miracles and then the school store. Once the school colors
were changed to any color of tic dye, the school store was no longer just
a markct for marijuana, but for dyes as well. “And the store is making
better moncy than ever!” Kukyendall shouted with a televangclical
smile. The majority of the profits from the marijuana market have natu-
rally been invested into the Davidson art department, which is also
flourisihing.

But Kuykendall was also right when he said, “we still have a ways
to go.” Although students are no longer spaced out and nauscous during
their classes, they are sull spaced out.

And the old infir- mary has had to
become a shelter for those, like John

rybody else’s, like being fat was a
bad thing to be”, responded a tear-
ful Jass. The prosecution rested its
case.
After four hours of delibera-
tion, the Honor Council returned
with guilty verdicts on two counts
and severe sanctions. Joe
Schmozowsky was found guilty of
perjury for claiming to have called
Hugh Jass “‘fatso” rather than “lard
ass.” For this he was sentenced to
a one semester suspension effec-
tive immediately. Schmozowsky
was also found guilty for violating
Section IV of the Code of Respon-
sibility by insulting and threaten-
ing another student. For this viola-
tion he received the following
sanctions: upon his return to
Davidson the defendant must en-
roll in a Weight Watcher’s pro-
gram, he must not consume Ben
and Jerry’ s on campus or come on
campus after having consumed said
icecream, he must serve 200 hours
of community service under a fat
guy named Barry in the Davidson
housckeeping department, and
finally he must consume over
12,000 calories every day for two
months and keep arunning journal
of his meals. The Honor Council
regressed after announcing the
sanctions.
