in the Twin-city. “Flagpole” Ed-
monson strengthened his lock again
at W. C,-and claims he’s all set for
the Spring Frolics now. The Chaney

“Hackback” Dudley were seen
grazing in the palors of the same
with Betty Jean and Ruth. Davis
and Behrman attempted to light
up the “old flames” at Winthrop.
The Reverend Knox was operat-
ing but won't release any dope.

that four-day weekend with Flora
MacDonald’s own Mary.

The biggest deal pulled by the

carried away with the evenings en-
tertainment.

Grand Secretary, was the guest
of the chapter Thursday night.

According to some of the “deal-

Davidson College is a cross between
a concentration camp and a Tues-
day evening sewing circle, but if
they would delve into the records
and old statutes of our institution
they would uncover some facts
which would undoubtedly cause the

God, and that Christ is the only
possible saviour for the world”. Dr.
Barbour pointed out that Christ
takes our personalities and by his
power makes them an image of his
own. The communion service which
was officiated by. Dr. Barbour and
Mr. Carl Pritchett, climaxed the
Spring Services.
Tuesday morning, Dr. Barbour
spoke for the first time at the
chapel exercise choosing as his
subject “What kind of a religion
do you have?”. In discussing his
topic he raised the following—ques-

tions: First, “Is your religion
academic or activating?,” Second,
“Is it occasional or continual”,

Third. “Is it private or public”, and
Fourth, “Is it comfortable or is it
commanding.

For the evening service Tuesday,
Barbour spoke om ‘What shall I
do with my life.” His advice was
“To chose the things in life that
last. Trade your life for something
that’s worth jt~Christ.” What
Christ does to those who associate
with him,” continued Dr. Barbour,
