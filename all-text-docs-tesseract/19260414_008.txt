Davidson College Has
Unsurpassed Facilities
for Military Training

| Davidson Has Ideal Drill Grounds |
and Rifle Courses

IS WELL EQUIPPED

‘National Guard Officers Witnessed
Combat Problems

i

Of the 40 R. O. T. C. units in the Fourth
Corps Area there are few if any with facili-
ties for military training that equals those at
Davidson. Besides ample drill area for close
order drill, and a modern rifle range conven-
iently located, the R. O. T. C. unit atDavid-
son has easy access to the finest sort of com-
bat manuever terrain. The golf course and.
the terrain along Concord road afford ample
space for platoon, company, and battalion
combat problems.

Last year aftéf an afternoon’s practice
march, the Davidson unit launched into a,
‘series of combat problems, Every Wednes-
day afternoon there were four problems, one
for each company, going on at the same time.
While one company was having a problem in
outpost at the end of Academy avenue an-
other company was having a problem in or-
' ganization of the ground for a company in
defense across from the golf course. At the
same time the other two companies were
having problems in advance guard and com-
pany attack along Concord road. In these
latter problems blank ammunition was used.
About 30 National Guard officers from
North and South Carolina visited Davidson
in order to witness these problems. A high
ranking officer in the North Carolina Guard
pronounced the work done in the company in
attack as comparable to that given at the
Fort Benning Infantry School, where he had
| made a close study of the latest methods of
infantry in the attack.

The Davidson College armory, which was
remodeled last summer, is centrally located
on the campus. It affords ample space down-
stairs for rifles and other government equip-
ment, while the up-stairs is divided into four’
| class rooms which are used only by the Mili-
| tary department of the college. These class
| rooms are equipped with a sand table, relief
| map, and landscape targets. From a military
| point of view they are the best on the campus.

‘Many Officers Are
_ Leaders On Campus

Each year since the founding of the R. O.
T. C. unit at Davidson it has been officered |
by cadet officers chosen from among David-
,son’s most prominent juniors and_ seniors.
| During the past four years three student body
{presidents have been among this number,
[two of them being commanders of “B"”
| Company. Among the ranks of Advanced
| Course students are found from one-third to
| one-half of the members of Omicron Delta
| Kappa, Davidson's highest ranking honorary
fraternity, recognizing all-round campus
} leadership. Membership in this body is in-

deed enhanced by high rank in the Cadet ,

Corps. Among the Phi Beta Kappa men
, also are found a full share of cadet officers.
For the past two years Davidson’s two
