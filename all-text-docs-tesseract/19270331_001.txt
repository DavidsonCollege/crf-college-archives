the question, “Resolved; That’ the United
States should adopt a uniform marriage and

Davidson debaters upheld the negative side
of ‘the question.

Henry Powetl and Leo Pritchett repre-
sented Davidson, while Eugene O'Dunne, Jr.,
and Donald C. Niles represented Johns

His speech took on the reli-
gious hue for a while as he declared that the
child should be taught the true Christian
manner of living, a thing that is too often
left to the Sunday School.

Eugene O’Duune, Jr., of Johns Hopkins,
stated as refutation to Powell's arguments
that he believed people could not be taught

The affirmative declared that the evil
which resulted from diversityvof laws were
caused by laxity of divorce laws.

O’Dunne caused quite a titter throughout

the rich can go to Parjs and get their di-
vorces, while the poor have to stay at home
and bear the burden.”

The debate was held in the chapel of
