Program Presénted

By High School Band

J. C. Harper, = Davidson Trustee,
Directs Lenoir Band

A concert Thursday night by the
sixty-eight-piece Lenoir High School
Band, directed by James C. Harper,
an alumnus of Davidson, was the mu-
sical event of the week.

The concert was well received by an
audience which nearly filled Chambers
auditorium. The program included
several very difficult numbers and the
applause from the audience brought
forth several encores. Prominent
numbers on the program were
’“Echoes From the Metropolitan Opera
House,” by Tobani; “Selections From
the Red Mill,” by Herbert, and “Selec-
tions From II Trovatore,” by Verdi.

In the “Red, Mill” selection was fea-
tured a large lighted red mill at the
rear of the stage, the blades of which
turned in time to the music.

The soloists, Jake Martin on the
cornet and Ralph Martin, clarinetist,
were called back several times for en-
cores, as were the brass. quartet and
the woodwind quintet. James C. Pfohl,
director of the Davidson Band which
played at Lenoir the previous week,
directed the Lenoir Band in “March
From the Peers of Iolanthe,” by Sul-
livan.

Ninety-Eight Will
Receive Diplomas

Last Issue Erroneously Stated 62
Would Graduate

Ninety-eight, and not sixty-two,
students, as was stated in last
week's edition of “The Davidson-
ian,” are eligible for graduation
from Davidson College this spring.

Last week’s issue carried a list
of ninety-eight seniors who are
candidates for graduation, but in a
lead to the story it was erroneously
stated that only sixty-two mem-
bers of the class of ’34 would re-
ceive diplomas.

Fifty-eight of the total number
will receive Bachelor of Science
degrees, while forty will get Bach-
elor of Arts degrees.

According to F. W. Hengeveld,
registrar, diplomas for the ninety-
eight seniors will be ordered soon.

Dr. McConnell Not

Dean of Faculty Unable to Com-

Dr. John Moore McConnell, head of
the history department and dean of
the faculty, who has been urged for
the last several weeks to be a candi-
date for the General Assembly, said
the latter part of last.week he felt it
would be impossible for him to run,

issues, and is considered one of the
county’s best informed men. Numer-
ous citizens have urged him to consent
to make the race, either for the Senate
or for the House of Representatives.

The latter part of last week he said
he would be delighted to serve in the
General Assembly but felt that he
could not spare the time from his work
here in event of his election. The fact
that the General Assembly frequently
remains in session until late in the
spring was pointed out as a reason for
his belief that he should not offer for
the Legislature. If he should be elect-
ed, he would be forced to obtain a
leave of absence from his duties here,
and this would necessitate a rearrange-
ment of his work,

Jackson Attends Meet
Of College Treasurers

Mr. F. L. Jackson left Monday for
Princeton for a two-day session with
the members of the National Commit-
tee on Standard Reports for Institu-
tions of Higher Learning.

This committee has been in existence
for four years. “Their meeting at
Prinéeton,” said Mr. Jackson, “is to
go over the final draft of reports of
suggested forms for the National Com-
mittee on Standard Reports for Insti:
tutions of Higher Learning.

“The eight or- nine pamphlets cov-
ering the work, which have already
been printed and distributed, are to
be combined into one volume which
will be the most comprehensive and
complete work on accounting and re-
porting for college finances that has
yet been published.”

The other two members of the com-
mittee are Mr. Mills, bursar and assist-
ant treasurer of Princeton, and Mr.
Hungate, auditor of Teachers College,
Columbia University.

Glasgow Talks To
Students In Third
Of Lecture Series

Charlotte Business Man Delivers
Vocational Guidance Message
to Record Gathering

RECOMMENDS HONESTY

Stresses Importance of Energy,
Brains and Willingness"

The third of a series of vocational
guidance lectures was delivered in Phi
Hall Friday night by Mr. Thomas Glas-
gow, prominent business man of Char-
lotte and an official of the NRA. Mr.
Glasgow spoke on Business to one of
the largest crowds ever to attend a
vocational guidance lecture.-

As a beginning to his address the
speaker stated that he looked upon
business as the greatest trade from
the standpoint of. intricacies that he
knew anything about. “Do fot feel
that business is the lowest profession,”
he urged. “It has not been and never
will be. Business is worthy of the in-
telligence of young men.”

In answering the question, “What
is the most important thing a business
man wants when he hires a young
man?” Mr. Glasgow stated that “com-
mon, ordinary honesty” is the most
important quality that business men}
require. He warned his listeners not

“Do not let others set your standard
of honesty. You set it.”

After honesty, the speaker added
that energy, brains, and the willingness
to learn are the next essentials of the
young business man’s character. “Do
all you are paid to do and more. Learn
the job above you so that when pro-
motion comes, you will be prepared for
it.”

When asked, “Should the young
business man have intimate friends?”
Mr. Glasgow replied that it was best
to be intimate with none and friendly
with all. The speaker also stated that
a college degree is, of course, fine, but
the employer does not consider that
only. Although many college gradu-
ates are good business men, there are

Dean of Davidson Faculty Be-
lieves President’s Policies Will
Restore Economic Prosper-
ity to United States

“Yes, I am very much in favor of
the new deal,” said Dr. J. M. McCon-
nell, dean of faculty, in an interview
Monday afternoon. “I think it is an
honest effort on the part of President
Roosevelt and his associates to restore
economic prosperity in this country.

“Though I see some things to criti-
cize in their program, in the main it
seems to me that they are adopting
excellent plans, and that in the end
their efforts will lead to the restora-
tion of prosperity in the United States.

“Of course, there are many other
agencies at work to help toward the
return of good times, but I believe that
the President and his associates are
doing a great deal to speed up the re-
turn of prosperity.

“The three things most needed when
President Roosevelt came into office,
to bring about a return of prosperity,
were, first, the re-establishment of con-
fidence. Our banks especially were in
a deplorable condition with their re-
sources running low and the depositing
public determined to secure cash on all
their accounts in the banks. By clos-
ing the banks and giving the people
an opportunity to recover from their
fear, and then by taking measures to
convince the people that the re-opened

banks were sound, the government was

able, after a few months, to re-estab-
lish confidence in its financial institu-
tions.

“The second important undertaking
of the President was to restore pur-
chasing power on the part of the gen-
eral public, and especially to the labor-
ing classes. With twelve million peo-
ple out of employment, and with the
price of farm products lower than they
had been for decades, there were not
many people in this country who could
buy the goods they needed. The NRA
was the agency established to bring in-
dustrial workers back into employ-
ment, and to give them higher wages.

“The reduction of hours of work per
week and an increase in the wages
given to working. people, not only cre-
ated the demand for more workers,
but also gave all the workers more
money so that they could begin to
buy food and clothing, and other nec-
essary commodities.

“The third important step was the
agricultural adjustment act. The main
purpose of this act was to restore
prices to a higher level for agricultural
products. ‘This plan was to be worked
in close conjunction with the NRA. The
processing tax charged manufacturers
was to give a-fund from which higher
prices could be guaranteed to farm-
ers. The farmers would then be able
to purchase more goods, and this
would enable the manufacturers to sell
