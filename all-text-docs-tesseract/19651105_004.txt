The Hard- Working Four Preps To Stop At Davidson

Davidson Debate Team
Journeys To Atlanta

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Four varsity and four fresh-
man members of the Davidson
debate team left yesterday for
Atlanta to compete in the Emory
Peachtree Tournament.

-Sponsored .by the Barkeley
Forum, this tournament will last
from Thursday until} Saturday.
Each team will debate ejght
rounds and. if they reach the
finals, will debate several more
rounds. This is. considered one,
of the better tournaments in

the South. |

Both the varsity and the. no-
vice teams have already shown
signs of achieving their first suc- ;

Ivy at the University of North.
Carolina the varsity won five
out of twelve rounds and, ac-
cording to Tom Earnhardt,
“learned a great deal about col-
lege debating.’ The competi-
tion included teams from West
Point, Princeton, Georgetown,
Illinois, Emory, Duke and Wake
Forest.

For three of the four mem-
bers of the varsity team, Mike

Tt was also the first time
that the team members had had
to debate both the affirmative
and negative sides of the ques-
tion, which this year reads, “‘Re-

agencies should be given great-
er freedom in the investigation
and prosecution of crime.”

program and its new coach Ray
MeMillin, the first semester will
more than likely be a trial and
error period in which they can
gain experience by debating
teams which have been together
for three or four years.

The debaters get their. infor-
‘mation from the Davidson li-
brary and from outside sources.
The reading necessary to pre-
pare for a debate seems, ac-
cording to Earnhardt, *‘almost
like another humanities course"

In the near future the team
will compete in the James Madi-
son Invitational at Princeton,
the Dixie Classic at Wake For-
est and several other tourna-
ments.

On Dec. 1 the Cambridge team
will come to Davidson for a
debate on the Viet Nam crisis.
In addition, there will soon be
debates men to the student body
which will include both inter-
Squad debates and exchange de-
bates with. neighboring schools.
