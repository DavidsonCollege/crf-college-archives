Falconi Sparks Cats,
Hopes For Best Year

By MARK CONNORS
Asst. Sports Ed.

A two-time first team All-
Southern conference selec-
tion, John Falconi has ‘‘con-
sistently worked to be better”
and hopes to help Davidson to
its best season ever.

A first team all-city selec-
tion his senior year in high
school, Falconi was offered
scholarships at several
schools including Duke, Clem-
son, Wake Forest, Holy Cross,
and Boston College.

Recruited late in his senior
year by Neil McGeachy
(presently head coach at
Duke), Falconi was very im-
pressed with the Davidson
campus and matriculated in
the fall of 1970. ;

According to head coach
Terry Holland, ‘John had a
very good freshman year. He

Gerdy Puts Skills To Work
In Philippine Cage Clinic

(Ed. Note: Former David-
son student and basketball
player Greg Gerdy is presen-
tly working with the Peace
Corps in the Philippines. He
still finds time for basketball,
however, and recently filed
the following report of his har-
dwood experiences in the
exotic lands.)

The best thrill for me so far
in the Phillipines has been my
role in a recently concluded
sports clinic for out of school
youths and club members.

I was the basketball skills
instructor, and whether my
past efforts at the game come
anywhere close to being called
a skill, I don’t know.

But somewhere along the
line I have picked up a few
ideas which could help these
fledgling stars.

Before the clinic began I sat
down at my desk and prepared
an elaborate schedule
drawing ideas from all the
basketball sources I’ve been
exposed to.

Included were all the Pete
Maravich drills which I’ve
never been able to perfect, the
power drive move adopted by
the Davidson coaches last
year which no one ever used,
and even time for a defensive
game which would have had
Bo Brickles teasing Terry
Holland for weeks.

My preparation didn’t end
there. I drew poster size
diagrams of defensive and of-
fensive strategies plus lists of
drills for self-improvement.
The office of the Manila YM-
CA Community Service staff
was beginning to look like a
coaches’ office.

The big first day finally
arrived. I bounced up the
Stairs to the gyn feeling con-
fident that I would now
distribute my vast storehouse
of basketball knowledge to the
50 or so participants and
thereby change the course of
basketball in the Phillipines.

This was, at that moment, a
not.too unreasonable goal...

Filipinos are usually ex-
cellent shooters, but come up
lacking in defensive prowess.

They are usually quick and
run a nice fast break, but
come up lacking in defensive
prowess.

Thus I was prepared to run
them through a series of
defensive drills which would
inspire them to gems which
would make Walt Frazier
proud.

As has now become the ex-
pected here in the Phillipines,
I ran into the unexpected. I
walked into the gym and
gazed at a_ veritable
madhouse.

The youths were playing
half-court games, volleyball
and badminton, and for the
most part, giving their efforts
to the game with no rules, hor-

y.
Immediately sensing a
pivotal point in my debut as a
coach, I decided that my
schedule was going to have to
be abandoned. I chose
the two tallest players to pick
teams and let them play.

I slipped off into a corner to
figure out which approach was
going to be the best. The
choice was relatively easy as I
noticed that we'd have to
review fundamentals and put
them to use immediately.

After 10 minutes of ob-
servation, I called the group
together and ran them
through passing, shooting, and
ball-handling drills, and
mixed them up with a number
of contests to keep their en-
thusiasm up.

After an hour it became ap-
parent that they were tiring,
so I let them scrimmage until
they had used up their last
ounces of energy.

This emergency schedule
proved to be a success the next
four days of the clinic. It was a
minor victory considering the
difficulties inherent in such a

program.
The youths were out-of-

_ school boys and girls, with lit- .

tle experience using English. I
had been studying my Tagalog
diligently and was able to han-
prompted me to consult my
co-worker to translate the dif-
ficult phrases.

It speaks well for basketball
that it is a game without a
significant language barrier.

Other difficulties included
the normal restlessness of the
youths and their consistency
inmissing layups and failingto
pass the ball. But this is no dif-
ferent than elsewhere.

It was a learning experience
for me. I found that en-
thusiasm is the vital factor in
teaching the youths regar-

diess of the cross-cultural dif- °

ferences.

What me was my
own enthusiasm. The lectures
became more animated than I
had anticipated while the low
points became springboards
to new ways of sparking their
enthusiasm.

My vote for the top coach
will go to one of the two girls
who participated in the clinic.
She coached one of the boys
teams to a 30 point victory
margin the final day of the
clinic.

was a very good shooter and
moved well without the ball.”’

‘‘John had to learn to handle
the ball better and take the
ball to the basket,’’ according
to Holland.

However, he emphasized
the consistent hard work of
Falconi and by concentrating
on his weak points, Falconi
has improved greatly over the
past two years.

‘John still needs to move
without the ball better but
overall, John has consistently
worked to be better and should
have a very good year.”’

A very unique quality of
Falconi’s is his concept of
team play. Always concerned
about playing as a team,
Falconi will not let an in-
terview by without making
mention of the team effort,
even if his performance was
singled out.

This strong dedication for
the team is accentuated in
Falconi's predictions for the
year. He said, ‘‘This is the best
team l’ve played on, it will

just take some time to see.

‘‘Tonight’s game against
Brown will be a good test to
see where we stand.”’

A two time first team All-
Southern conference selec-
tion, Falconi hopes to repeat
again this year. According to
Holland, Falconi's individual
recognition depends a great
deal on how well the team does
this year.

However, his chances of
repeating All Southern Con-
ference is quite good because
of the past two years
recognition.

As far as All-American is
concerned, Falconi said that it
really isn’t that important.

The play of John Falconi
was summed up by Holland
when he stated, ‘‘John was a
good player when he came to
Davidson, has consistently
worked hard, both during the
season and after, has consis-
tently become better, and most
important of all, had provided
consistent leadership for the
Wildcat Basketball squad. ’
