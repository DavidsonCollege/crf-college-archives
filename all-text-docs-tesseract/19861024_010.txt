By MIKE ADAMS

The Lafayette Leopards bar-
taged the Davidson football team
with seven consecutive scores in
the second and third quarters to
beat the Wildcats 51-14 at
Richardson Stadium last Satur-
day’~

The Cats started the game with
a strong showing. They forced
punts on each of the Leopards first
two possessions.

Lafayette came close to a
score on their third possession. A
33-yard run (6 the Davidson 11-
yard line would have gone for a
touchdown except for a diving
tackle from behind by junior
linebacker Howard Humphries.
The Cats defense kept the
Leopards out of the end zone and
blocked a 36-yard field goal at-
tempt on fourth down.

Davidson's offense was not
able to play up to the level of the
defense in the first quarter. The
Cats managed just one first down
and punted on all three of their
first quarter possessions.

Lafayette got its. offense in
gear in the second quarter, scoring
on all six possessions. Mean-
while, Davidson punted three
times and turned the ball over
twice.

Lafayette scored first on an

_83-yard drive capped by a three-

yard touchdown pass. Two short
Wildcat punts on their next two
possessions set up field goals of
28 and 36 yards for the Leopards
to make the score 13-0.

Lafayette score next after
freshman quarterback _ Peter
Hughes fumbled at the Davidson
22-yard line. It took the Leopards
only three plays to raise the score
to 20-0.

Less than two minutes later,
after yet amother short punt,
Lafayette scored again on a 19-
yard touchdown pass.

Davidson's next possession
ended after just one play: an inter-
ception thrown by senior quarter-
back Steve Bradley at the David-
son 24-yard line, Four plays later
Lafayette kicked a 38- yard field
goal to make the score 30-0 at the
half.

Lafayette completed i its string
of seven consecutive scores on its
first second half possession.

The Leopards got the ball on
their own 47-yard line after a
Davidson punt. Four straight run-
ning plays carried them to the
Davidson 16, where a Lafayette
halfback threw a touchdown pass
on an option play to make the
score 37-0,

The Wildcats finally got on
the board late in the third quarter:
Senior defensive end Marcus
Allen recovered a Lafayette fum-
ble at the 31-yard line.

Hughes opened the Wildcat
drive with an incomplete pass be-
fore throwing a‘six-yard comple-
tion to freshman receiver Shan
Teel. The Cats used a little tric-
kery on their third down play.
Junior wide receiver Charlie Win-
bore, a quarterback at times last
season, took the ball on a pitch
from Hughes and threw a 25-yard
touchdown to Teel in the end
zone.

Hughes led the Cats to another
score On their next possession
with a 99-yard drive.

The Cats started at their own
one-yard line after a Lafayette
punt. Pass completions of 17 and
12 yards, along with two Leopard
penalties, brought the Cats to the
Lafayette 38-yard line. On first
down, Hughes lofted a 38-yard
touchdown to sophomore receiver
Mike Gross, who made a leaping
catch as he fell in the end zone.

Saphomore Katherine Malory pleys the bail

By PAM HARMANN
The field hockey team’s re-
cord took a turn for the better this
week, as did their quality of play.
They tied Salem College on Tues-
day in Winston Salem, 3-3, and

lost to a strong Wake Forest team

3-0 at home on Thursday to bring
their record to 1-10-1.

Davidson played very well
against Salem, especially during
the first half when they “could do
no wrong” according to coach
Betsey Pryor. Offensively they
put a lot of pressure on the Salem
defense resulting in several pen-
alty corners. The Cats stayed
within Salem's 35-yard line 80

percent of the time. By halftime it °

was 2-0 in Davidson's favor.

In the second half, Salem
came out fired up. Their star
player, an exchange student from

Holland, dominated the game,
scoring immediately after
halftime, and again a few minutes
later. Davidson seemed very con-

forced to mark her all over the:

Davidson's three goals wete
scored by senior captain Heather
McKee, and sophomores Suzanne
Mauze and Katherine Mallory.

The loss against Wake Forest

time Davidson faced the Deacons

As against Salem, Davidson
was not quite as strong after inter-
mission, During the second half,
play covered the entire field and
both teams took more shots on
goal. Wake Forest was more suc-
cessful with their shots, however.
Davidson goalie senior Nana Lay
saved eight of 10 shots on goal.

Coach Pryor feels her team is
much more aggressive offensively
now than at the start of the season.
They are pressuring well in the
circle, and working better as a.
team. This takes time, but luckily
Davidson has a young team.
Many individual strengths are
starting to shine, thus helping the

Place on Wednesday against High
