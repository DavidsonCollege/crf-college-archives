Little dots o’ powder, little daubs of

Make the little vampire look like what
she aint. F
Little bit of snake oil, kind o’ slovenly
way

Makes a first-class tea-hound out of any
country jay.

After.

But when the vamp and tea-hound,
What e’er they were before,

Get together near a jazzy band
They sure do rock the floor.

Tinkle, Tinkle, Little Bell.

‘Linkle, tinkle, little bell!

Never yegg in prison cell

Never soul in blackest—(Well,
No one, we think—none can tell)
Suffered torment like that bell.

When they rang the little bell,

Out the students ran pell-mell;

Took one pained look—(‘Tis sad to tell!)
And set up such an awful yell

You'd think they’d ring its funeral knell;
Vhis inoffensive litte bell.

“YDo you feel bad, little bell

That you creak, and squeak, and yell,

And imitate a cracked cow-bell

When we thought you’d sound so well?

Don’t you know a proper bell

Gives round sweet notes that swell and
swell

Till every echo of the dell

Rings back a tribute to the bell?

Why can’t you do it, little bell?

Dear profs and trusteés; you who dwell
Beyond the sound of this new bell—
We love our whistle blast so well
We fain would keep it. But tell
Of this new bell

Engenders madness! Let us sell
Please Ict us sell this awful bell.

The other day I had the good fortune
to come upon the well known maker of
Eskimo Pies. To my_horror it is a very
cruel process. The maker of these pies
has several cold cows, which shiver con-
stently, grazing as they do entirely on
hundred pound blocks of ice, per cow.
Several men sit with pails of chocolate
on one side, and the cows on the other.
They milk the ice cream which the cows
give into small forms, and then drop
them one by one into the chocolate and
they come out Eskimo pies.

The Fiercest Fight of All.
I’ve landed on the rugged strands
Of many a foreign country
And failures more than eight score
Have happened all to me.

I’ve suffered the pangs of hunger’s fangs.
My throat parched from thirst,
I’ve ached and I've bled till I wished I
were dead
As I quietly moaned and cursed.

The sickening gore of the bloody war
I had to endure on the seas,

And I've tried to pass thru liquid gas
With a squad of S. A. T. C's.

I've been aflroat in an open boat—
Adrift for days and days
kought hand to hand with

a savage

And scorched in a forest blaze.

In the bitter cold I've dug for gold
On a little Yukon creek
But the only bout that
me out

ever knocked

Was a Davidson Junior Speaking

FAR ENOUGH.

A young man had called upon his best
girl the night before. As a result he
had but poorly prepared his Virgil les-
son. In spite of this fact he translated
fairly well for a short time but after
reading “and IT put my arms around her”
he suddenly stopped, unable to translate
farther, and said:| “That is as far as I

got, Professor.” The instructor's reply
was, “That is far enough, young man.”

And now we have artificial lightning. One million
volts of electricity—approximately one fiftieth of the
voltage in a lightning flash—have been sent success-
fully over a transmission line in the General Engineer-
ing Laboratory of the General Electric Company.
This is nearly five times the voltage ever before
placed on a transmission line.

Man-Made Lightning

RRANKLIN removed some of the mystery. But
only recently has science really explained the
electrical phenomena of the thunderstorm.

Dr. C. P. Steinmetz expounds this theory. Rain-
drops retain on their surfaces electrical charges,
given off by the sun and other incandescent bodies.
In falling, raindrops combine, but their surfaces do
not increase in proportion.
pressure grows rapidly, Finally it reaches the limit
the air can stand and the lightning flash results.

Hence, the electrical

Much valuable knowledge of high voltage phenom-
ena—essential for extending long distance trans-
mission—was acquired from these tests. Engineers
now see the potential power in remote mountain
streams serving in industries hundreds of miles away.

Man-made lightning was the result of ungrudging
and patient experimentation by the same engineers
who first sent 15,000 volts over a long distance
thirty years ago.

“Keeping everlastingly at it brings success.”
It ‘is difficult to forecast what the results of the next
thirty years may be.
