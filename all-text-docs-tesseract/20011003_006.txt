Wild court parties, talk radio, Jack Welch
and quesadillas. Meet Kells Hetherington.

Well, responses to my announcement in
the last paper haven’t been too numerous, so
it remains a mystery as to whether or not this
will be the last of the interviews. If you have
no idea what I’m talking about, pull out last
week’s Davidsonian and scan the A&L sec-
tion to find out what’s up. Then read this
week’s interview, and tell us what you think.
I am very excited to bring you an interview
which has been a long time in the making.
Kells Hetherington, by allreports, isalegend
in his own time. He graciously agreed to
answer my inane questions. If you don’t
know him, now’s your chance! Consider it a
sort of literary version of shaking hands. Be
sure to wave hello when you see him at
Commons, or elsewhere on this intellectual
sod. If you are privileged enough to have
rubbed shoulders with this Davidson icon,
then read on for more of your favorite manon
campus.

MH: So Kells, where are you from?

KH: Martha, Lam from New Canaan, Con-
necticut.

MH: Is that home for you, or...

KH: Oh I would definitely describe it as
home—we have lived
there for 20-plus years
now.

MH: Wow. Sonow, tell
me: I thought for some
reason that you were a
senior, but seeing that you
live in the sophomore
apartments, I’m not so
sure. What class are you
in?

KH: (smiles) Good
question. Technically, I
am member of the class
of 2002. The reason I live
“down the hill” is, umm,
because I forgot to go to
RLO’s lottery night.

MH: Are you a member of a fraternity? °
KH: No, I just wasn’t oriented toward

Patterson Court freshman year, which is when
the selection process happens.

Ketts HETHERINGTON ‘02. The
man with a plan.

MH: How do you like living so close to
Patterson Court?

KH: (laughs) I like
it.

MH: Why?

KH: Well, I guess,
like every GREAT
American, I too love
wild Saturday night
parties.

MH: Let me
change the subject
and ask you some-

people want to know:
what happened be-
tween you and the
Davidsonian?

KH: Well, I just

didn’t see eye-to-eye with the paper’s man-
agement. (smiles).

MH: Kells, letme be more specific. Wasn’t

there an incident after the paper ran a particu-

thing that a lot of’

lar story you wrote about admissions in the
spring of 1999?

KH: Yes, there was. The Admissions Of-
fice said that I had over analyzed the informa- .
tion with which they had provided me. Now
maybe that happened, but I don’t think so;
nevertheless, people are entitled to have their
own opinion. However, I wouldn’t take their
complaints completely at face value. (Gives
a deep sigh — aaaaahhh) I think the real
problem with that article was that it didn’t
sing the praises of the Admissions Office.
And to conclude, I hope that we can move
past this disagreement. So there you go.

MH: What is your major?
KH: I’m a Political science major.

MH: Have you focused on a particular
region in your studies?

KH: Yes. I began with a heavy emphasis
on American politics. Then after a trip to
South Africa, I became fascinated sub-Sa-
haran Africa and have sort of made that my
focus. Now I feel a little funny saying that

Three Kings offers haunting, ironic perspectives on America

By Derek Lou
Arts and Living Co-Editor

I returned to one of my favorites of recent
movies this weekend. And I realized, with
some surprise, that after September 11, it
emerged as a film greater than the one I first
saw two years ago.

[had always feared that David O. Russell’s
Three Kings would become dated. When I
saw it for the first time on October 3, 1999, it
was a film that criticized our Americentric
attitudes towards just about everything. I
feared, however, that in time these- attitudes
would change and that Three Kings would
become
just an-
other a
time cap-
sule. Sure,
its ideas of
friendship
and jour-
nalism |
would re-
main in-
tact, but
what about °
its at-
tempts to
resensitize
us to vio-
lence,- to Clooney
remind us that we are, as a whole, an ignorant
country, to show us that we are not the great,
world police we think we are? As oureconomy
flourished, as our prominence in the world
only grew, Three Kings would become a
silly, sensitive, liberal, ironic, almost anti-
American film.

And then September 11. Now, it seems
that nothing is sensitive enough.

The film still retains its power as a screw-
ball comedy. All the jokes remain unharmed,
and its examinations of gunshots still work.
George Clooney and Ice Cube are still strong
and powerful, and Nora Dunn’s reporter still
carries the film. (She has one of the smaller
speaking roles, but probably the most impor-
tant.)

What’s different this time around are
Conrad (Spike Jonze) and Troy (Mark
Wahlberg). I don’t laugh at Conrad’s stupid-
ity or feel bad for him; I now understand from
where Conrad is coming, and his comment,
“Whites
make bet-
ter quar-
terbacks
t han
blacks,” is
probably
the sim-

truest line
in the film.
(No, I
most cer-
tainly
don’t be-
lieve that
whites or
blacks
make better quarterbacks based on their race.
But in a movie with so many contradictory
ideas, this one is the most clear. And by
“truest”, I mean only that Conrad truly: be-
lieves what he is saying; he is a man un-
clouded by ideas of political correctness, and
he is free to speak his mind.)

‘believe his com-

“self-centered

plest and’

Then there’s
Troy, whose po-
litical ignorance
and ___ bravery
made him the
hero of the movie
two years ago.
Now, I see him’
as amore pathetic
character than
Conrad. If there
is a character in
Three Kings that
represents our so-
ciety as a whole,
it is Troy. He’s
stupid enough to

plicated, illegal,
plan will work. He’s ignorant enough to

believe that Operation Desert Storm was a
mission simply to liberate Kuwait. But luck-

‘ily, an Iraqi character gives him a quick

lesson in politics and selfishness in a scene
that used to evoke sympathy for Troy. Now

‘it makes me feel ashamed.

Three Kings is as rich in symbolism as a
film can be. From its easy-to-miss back-
wards American flags to its explosive foot-
balls, from Bach to the Beach Boys to Bart
Simpson, its both the harshest and warmest
cinematic look at the United States of which
I can think. And there’s the wonderful con-
fusion between ally and enemy. Who’s the
bad guy? Who’s the good guy? By the end
of the film we know who is playing on what
team, but are we really sure for whom we
should be rooting?

Ice Cube and Wahlberg

If [learned anything while rewatching Three
Kings, it is that the film cannot be contained
in a simple article or discussion. I ama silly,
little film nerd, and thus, please do not take
me seriously when I say that watching Three
Kings this weekend was one of the most
profound cinematic experiences I have had. I
realized something very important about the
nature of film, or any form of art: that our
reactions to a piece depend entirely on the
context in which we experience them. That
said, watching Three Kings sometime soon

_ will surprise those who have seen the film

more than those who have not.
