The ‘new revised edition

of the library handbook will

soon be pubiished, according to Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson, di-
rector of the College Library. Dr. Davidson said that the new
book had been revised in accordance with modern language and
the Association of Bibliographical Standards.

Several infelicitous styles have
been eliminated, and an effort has
been made to clarify and simplify
the directions for the student.

Of local interest is a new
section of examples on foot-
note forms used by the publica-
tions of Davidson College
which faculty and alumni have.
written.

This new little book will contain
most of the information contained
in the previous ones, and the pic-
tures that illustrated the other book
are used in this one. .

Professor H. T. Villy has been
added to the staff of writers for the
book. The staff is now composed of
Dr. Cumming, Professor Lilly, Dr.
C. G. Davidson, and Mr. Gordon
Wood, now of the University of
Chattanooga.

Dr. Davidson said that he re-
gretted that the manuscript went to
the printer too tate to include the
name of Mr. Ken Boyer, who is now
serving as head of circulation for
the library.

The new booklet is being printed
in the town at the Davidson Print-
ing Co., the same firm which prints
The Davidsonian.

Stud Alone Carries
Senior Rings Now

The Student Store will this year
he the sole representative for the
sale of the senior rings, Doug Rice
has announced.

Herff Jones and Jenkiits rings
will be sold for the next year or
two and by the end of that time
the company that has proved the
most popular in sales will be the
exclusive ring of the college.

The principal reason for the
change in procedure in the sale of
the rings which was previously car-
ried on by students selected by the
‘companies, is economy. Doug ex-
plained that some cut in price is
now possible. and that the constant
aim of the student store in general
is that of lower prices to students,

When the student store began
operation in 1923, in the basement
of Watts dorm, the rings were sold
ouly there. In that era, when the
store was run by student managers,
the honor system was in full ef-
fect, but after the war huge losses
caused the change to the present
organization.

Under the old set-up the student

managers didn't have time to ap--
ply in taking the orders for rings,
so the various. jewelry companies
persuaded = the college authorities
to have a limited number of stu-
dents outside the student store sell
their sings.

Cost of the rings varies from
twenty-eight to forty dollars, de-
pending on the weight, fraternity
seal, and some other. special pro-
cesses that are available. The
twenty per cent federal and three
per cent state taxes are added to the
selling price.

The hours during which the stu-
dent store will be open from Mon-
day to Friday for first semester are
as follows: 8:15-1:00 in the morn-
ing (closed for chapel); 1:30-5:30
in the afternoon; 7:00 to 12:00 at
night. On Saturday the hours are
from 8:15-12:30 in the day and 9:00-
12:00 at night. The Stud will be
closed during the afternoon of all
home games.

Students To Note
Rules, Regulations
Conceming Church

With Vespers being held each
Sunday in the new church, there
are some new rules and regulations
that students should notice. One of
the most important of these is that
Students get a white card for the
absence check from a monitor at
one of the doors and turn it back
in with their names signed at the
end of the serviee.

Dean Bailey calls attention to the
fact that the cards don't have to
be returned to the same monitor
and also that they can only issue
one card to aystudent.

If a student comes in after
the prelude he is given a blue
card which signifies that he is
tardy; there will be no admis-
sion of any student after the
sermon begins.

As for the seating arrangements
the students may sit anywhere on
the main floor, and if the pews are
properly filled no one will have to
sit behind a column and there will
be room for all the students. Only
a limited number of guests are per-
mitted to sit on the main floor, but
if a student has a visitor, he may
be invited to sit on the main floor.

Dean Bailey expressed the desire
that everyone will remember these
rules and follow them, so that the
rough edges evidenced along these
lines in the opening vespers will
soon be smoothed out.

Buddy Morrow To Play

For Homecoming Dances

By MOODY SMITH

Court Of

Control

Swings Into Action

The Court of Control for this year will get into action late
next week, according to Ernest Barry, Judge of the court this
year. Judge Barry stated that he and his court would be ready to
try freshmen for offenses to upperclassmen probably Wednesday

or Sater.

Such, offenses as walking on the
grass, not speaking to upperclass-
men, disobeying their rules, and gen-
cral ohnoxiousness are a faw of the
charges that will spell a rough life
for any misguided frosh.

Judge Barry stated that he
planned to have Recorder Gene
Craven give the Davidsonian a
complete list of boys tried,
their offenses, and their punish-
ments for the paper every Fri-
day. Thus, any freshman who
is judged will be surveyed after
his first offense and watched
carefully until the end of the
first semester, Barry explained.

Other members of the court this
year are: seniors Arnold Whisnant
and Dick Perkins; juniors Fred
Stowe and Bill Shipley; and sop-
homores Isham Benneit and Dick
Davis.

New Identification
Policy Introduced

The College has adopted a new
policy in identifying students at
football games and other student
activities. For the first time stu-
dents are being furnished with
identification cards bearing their
name and photograph.

This card will not be used for
gaining entrance to football games
alone, but will serve as an admis-
sion ticket to all other athletic
events, to the Artist Series to the
Concert Series, and to certain activ-
ities to be held in the Student
Union.

Athletic Director Paul K. Scott
stated that this new system has
been adopted in order to create
greater efficiency in the various

fields it will affect. For instance, |

whereas a different card has pre-
viously been printed for cach stu-
dent activity, one will now serve
the purpose.
Numerals will be printed
around the card’s edge and will

be punched out upon attending

certain activities. Often. how-

ever, simply the preeentation of
the card will be sufficient to
gain entrance to an event.

These pictures have been printed
in quadruplet so that one will ap-
pear on the ID card, one on physi-
cal education files, one on the files
in the Dean of Men's office, and
one on the files in the Alumni of-
fice.

Students will be notified on
the bulletin board when they
are to pick up the cards. They
are expected to arrive at least
by the end of next week.

In case a student loses his card,
a new one can be procurred for
him at a cost of about fifteen cents.
It is hoped that this new system
of identification will prove to be
as economical and as efficient at
Davidson as it has at many other
colleges and universities.

booking at the Stee! Pier in Atlan-
tic City during the. Miss America
Contest. This is generally con-
sidered by band men as one of the
top bookings in the business.

Since Morrow’s band is compara-
tively new this will be one of his
first trips below the Mason-Dixon
line. He ‘has, however, gained con-
siderable following throughout the
nation by virtue of his recent RCA
Victor recordings which include:
“Got You On My Mind,” “One Mint
Julep.” and “Night Train."

Furnishing the femate interest
with Morrow’s band will be pretty
Joan Hovis. .

The formal homecoming dance is
slated to begin on, October 21 ‘at 9
p.m, and continue until 1 pm,
while the informal affair the follow-
ing night will be from 8 p.m., til
12 midnight. Hours for a concert or
a tea dance have. not as yet been
set.

Morrow madc his professional de-
but as a trombonist, which he still
is, playing for hjgh school dances in
his home town of. New Haven,
Conn. Later he studied at the Jul-
liard, School of Music in New York
City after which he joined Paul
Whiteman's band. After an eight-
month stay with Whiteman, Mor-
row hooked up with the orchestra
of the late Eddy Duchin .

Morrow then played with Artie
Shaw. Vincent Lopez, and Tommy
Dorsey until World War II inter-
rupted hig career.

Returning to the music world
after three years it the Navy, he

first played with Jimmy Dorsey °

as the featured trombone artist.

Buddy then organized a recording
band of his own in 1950 for RCA
Victor. His first record was “Rio
Rita” followed shortly by four other
waxings, the most successful of
which was “Solo.”

From that moment on Morrow's
band became recognized as one of
the most promising dance aggrega-
tions around, though paradoxically
enough, it had not yet played a
dance, having concentrated on re-
cordings.

Buddy's first engagement with
the band was at the Steel Pier at
Atlantic City in August, 1951, where
he also played last summer. In
March of this year the band played
at the world famous Hollywood
Palladium.

The success of the Morrow band
was authoritatively recognized in
the 1951 annual Billboard magazine
Dise Jockey Poll when over 2,000
disc jockeys voted him the most
promising band in the country.

The trombone that Buddy Mor-
row plays today is a custom made
job which cannot be duplicated by
any commercial manufacturer. It is
insured for $10,000 and is «kept
under constant wtach at all times
when he is playing a job.
