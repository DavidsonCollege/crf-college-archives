Why must sexual abuse persist?

By Brett Simpson

In regard to the male/female dynamic of
sexual abuse, I can’t write empathetic words of
wisdom. From my perspective, though, much still
needs to be done to rid ourselves of it. We all know
the power that “NO!” must assume in sexual
situations. We know about the power struggle at
the root of sexual abuse, the insidious male idea of
women’s rape fantasies, women allowing them-
selves to slide into dangerous situations, and the
permanent damage sexual abuse can leave on both
attacker and victim. But for all the information we
collectively know, commiserating understanding
is still lacking, leading to personal catastrophes for
an unlucky few. .

Female victims of sexual abuse greet every
new sexual relationship with emotional scars and
gnawing nightmares. Male perpetrators of sexual
abuse (if brought to legal justice) must endure
incarceration, ruined hopes of a professional ca-
reer, and—TI hope—a lifelong heavy conscience.
Although all of the general public has attained
clear knowledge of all the possible damages, sexual

abuse still occurs. This truly boggles my mind.

I can’t even come to a conclusive opinion
about why it still occurs. Does genetic barbarity
factor in? Does the alcohgl-quickened sexual
tingle overcome reason when a woman looks too
appealing, or is that only a precursor to the inner-
driven power struggle. soon ensuing?

Where the lines are drawn, and where they
fade... I can’t tell. And I’m sorry to all women
for the fact that people can only logically under-
stand the pain of sexual abuse, and that male
empathy for (female oriented) sexual abuse can-
not be gained. These are permanent handicaps
women must work against when educating men
about sexual abuse.

I have neither answers nor advice. If only to
reiterate, I'm in no position to use this article to

jockey a delineated viewpoint on this matter. I

guess I’m merely concluding with the rather sad-
dening opinion that even though we have been
educated and socialized against such behavior,
sexual abuse remains a germane issue to everyone,
AllI can suggest is to keep talking, to keep voicing
your views and your thoughts. Silence about the
issues seems the most grave injustice of all.
