An embarrassing release from the Thrill Kill Kult

“So you wanna do something
that’s a little bit not too afro-cen-
tric-erotic-space-groove-jazz-
funk-acid-punk?”

My Life with the Thrill Kill
Kult calls their music “a
psychomatik expressionism in
sound and beat.”

I prefer to think of it as the
kind of unlistenable, pseudo-artsy
vomit that tarnishes the image of
legitimate dance groups like New
Order and Nine Inch Nails.

Possibly the most overly pre-
tentious musical project since the
Bee Gees’ box set, the Thrill Kill
Kult’s new album 13 Above the
Night is the brainchild of singer
“Groovie Mann” and musician
“Buzz” McCoy.

It appears that the point of
their music is to incorporate all the
seedy, underworldly elements of

sampling b-movies, documenta-
ries, and the like.

Sound bites of people saying
“You worship Satan!” and “I al-
ways wanted to be a movie star...
decorate a rhythm section of key-
boards, bass, and a drum machine.
Sound effects—screams, police
sirens, and crunchy guitar riffs in

.particular—add to the sonic

jumble. The beats themselves are
standard house fare.

Anything that strays from the
90’s dance formula sounds more
like an accident or a broken drum
machine than an attempt at non-
conformity. On top of all this
sound is the vocals, divided be-
tween Groovie Mann and the host
of female singers in the group’s
periphery. Groovie growls and
moans tunelessly throughout.

Fortunately, the backing sing-
ers, nicknamed the “Bomb Gang
Girlz,” are decent and make the
songs nearly tolerable.

The key to surviving the vo-
cals is to ignore Groovie’s words,
which should be a textbook ex-
ample of poorly written lyrics.

“Delicate Terror” is an example of
the tedious drivel that must be en-
dured throughout: “Hypnotic
mouth talks on fantasy phone/
Sanitarium borderline/ Gone to-
day and here tomorrow/ Killed his
taste for switchblades.”

Rarely has someone ever said
so little with so many words.

Compared to the few decent
groups (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry)
who also incorporate noise and

chaos into powerful rhythms, My |

Life With the Thrill Kill Kult em-
barrass themselves.

Their sound has no focus and
comes off as a pointless mishmash
of annoying sounds. i

The lyrics are similarly er-
ratic, tiresomely describing places
like “The Velvet Edge” and “the
temple of the Expanded Mind” but
never explaining to me why I
should care about them. 13 Above
The Night and its creators defi-
nitely belong somewhere far away
from any decent CD collection.

To quote the song “Electrical
Soul Wish:” “A place beyond
shame is where we belong.”

DRUNK DRIVING DOESN'T JUST KILL DRUNK DRIVERS.

Nicholas Esposito, killed Oct. 13, 1989 at 8:25 pm.

Next time your friend insists on driving drunk, do whatever it takes to stop him.
Because if he kills innocent people, how will you live with yourself?

Video rentals at the Union —

Feel like watching a movie
but don’t want to drive to Corne-
lius to rent one or don’t have a
car? The game room in the Union
provides a video rental within
walking distance.

Students can rent movies for
one dollar a night, or VCRs for
two dollars a night. Monday
through Thursday rentals are over-
night only, but Friday rentals are
due by Sunday.

The 125 movies available
provide a range wide enough to
satisfy any mood. One can rent a
Disney movie likeThe Little Mer-
maid, or arecent release such as
JFK. For aretro- 80s feel there is
Flashdance, and for romantics the
rental provides Casablanca or
Gone With The Wind.

Die-hard fans can rent the
Star Wars trilogy or The Godfa-
ther saga. Women with a ven-
geance can check out Thelma and
Louise for a night of viewing plea-

The game room rents out ap-
proximately 3 to 4 movies a day,
and there are 120 members of the
rental service. :

When astudent rents a movie
or VCR, he or she is required to
sign a contract promising that they
will return it. This has to be done
now because of problems in the
past.

“There is supposed to be an
honor code here, but people take
the videos and never return them,”
says Lulu Srinavasan, a game
room worker. She claims that the
workers call and pester people
who don’t return the videos, but
some still do not come back.

Despite these problems, the
video rental offers students a con-
venient alternative to Blockbuster.
The game room is open from
12:00-6:00 p.m. and 7:00-10:00
p.m. on weekdays, and 3:00-6:00
p.m. and 7:00-10:00 p.m. on
weekends.
