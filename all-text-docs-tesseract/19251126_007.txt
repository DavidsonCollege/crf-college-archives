- |! deavors,

While the mass of the students clammered
out of the picture show Saturday night cry-|
ing for their quarters, ill-spent on the “Beb-
gar On Horseback,” the intelligentia of the
college nodded cynical smiles of approval
over what seemed to them one of the best
pictures ever shown at Davidson.

However, far from approbation were the
words of one of the highest literary elites, H.
L. Shaw, Jr., editor of the Quips and Cranks.

in the student store that drove the writer into
a position psychologically (but not common-
sensically) ) known as “defense complex.”

as the student abode of such men as Gallo-

NEW HANDBALL COURTS

The hand ball court, which has been under
construction for the past few days, is to be;
completed by the end of this weck, according
to present plans.

This court will be used by the boxing team |
a great deal because the game of hand ball,
while simple, is one of the best for develop- |
ing quickness of eye and Captain |

| Elkins wants it to be distinctly understood |
|that this court is not to be simply the prop- |
erty of the boxers, but of every student
,on the campus.

Hand ball courts are not limited to exact
| dimensions, the only requirement being that |
‘there is room enough. This particular ‘court
| will accommodate easily four men, or two
teams. A large backboard will be placed
| at each end and serving {ines marked out.
| A volley ball court will also\be com-
| pleted this week and another next week.
| These three courts will provide room for
many more students to get in some exercise.
Captain Elkins is to be commended for his
efforts in this line, for these improvements
have been obtained largely through his en-

foot.

In fact it was such an attack on the merits |
