Court Convenes In Moronia

“Bootle indicated that only the fresh-
men who had already been convicted
of violations would be called up in
front of chapel. They would be tried

the night before the .

. « chapel.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN. May 13, 1960

Jim Bootle's promise of “reform”
was made last spring, when the Court
of Control was threatened with ex-
tinction. But Monday’s chapel session,
true to every barbaric tradition of the
Court, confirmed our _ suspicion:
Bootle’s promise was no more than a
pious gesture.

The Court, we are told, exists to
aid inexperienced freshmen in ad-
justing to college life. It’s all good,
clean fun.

The titter which runs through thé
mob when an ugly freshman stands

up: this is good. clean fun.
When an effeminate freshman is

indicted. the roars which follow him
down the aisle are uttered to ease his

adjustment to college life.

The jeering, the catcalls are offered
in a spirit of mature brotherly con-
cern for freshman welfare.

Actually, we're just counseling the

fellas.

Hogwash.

The Court of Control exists be-
cause stupid people have a vested in-
terest in stupidity.

It exists because good sense can al-
ways be voted down by yahoos and
Ssadists.

It exists because cruelty has been
disguised in the trappings of good,
clean fun.

The Court of Control acts tough
because toughness is the only resort
of those who are dead wrong, and the
bullies jeer so loudly because they’re
hidden in the mob.

We don’t believe in “reforming”
the Court. of Control. That would be
like trying to cure a leper with Band-
Aids.

The Court should. be abolished—the
sooner the better.

A Step For Academic Excellence

Comprehensive examinations are
not a panacea for every school’s acad-
emic problems, but reports of. suc-
cess from so many good colleges and
universities indicate that the system
is certainly worth thorough investi-
gation and probable application.

It is evident that a student can now
graduate from Davidson by cramming
for his semester examinations and
never having to synthesize the knowl-
edge he has acquired during his four
years at Davidson. We feel that the
purpose of a liberal arts education is
not being realized when students are
unable to relate or recall the majority
of the work they have been examined
on. Only in the honors program is a
student even required to review the
work done in his major subject.

In a DAVIDSONIAN interview earl-
ier this week Dean Johnston said,
“Comprehensive examinations can be
good for Davidson College if properly
administered.” We agree with Dean
Johnston and feel that it is up to the
faculty and administration to see that
the comprehensive examinations are
properly administered.

Proof that it is possible to admin-
ister effective comprehensive exami-
nations is exemplified by the state-
ments of officials from outstanding
colleges and universities which have

tried the system. An official of a well-
known seuthern university has stat-
ed, “We have had comprehensive ex-
aminations for so long a time that it
is almost impossible to determine the
effect of the examination on our acad-
emic tone. We consider that our pro-
gram has merit . , . Both faculty and
student body take the comprehensive
for granted. It is simply a part of the
program that must be successfully
mastered.”

An official of one of the leading
Ivy League colleges has stated, “I
think without any question the exis-
tence of the comprehensive examina-
tions quickens the whole intellectual
tone of the college. . . If we did not
have such a program here, I would
strongly urge its adoption.”

We hope that the curriculum com-
mittee will appoint a special commit-
tee to investigate comprehensives
and take action as soon as possible.
We feel the adoption of such examin-
ations will be a definite step toward
student maturity and academic excel-
lence.

In following weeks THE DAVID-
SONIAN will investigate the issue of
comprehensive examinations in more
detail and offer specific suggestions
for their introduction at Davidson.

Normality And The Fantastic Idea

Everything is back to normal, now.

The freshman, who a week ago was
wined and dined with shrimp, fruit
‘punch, cold cuts and hot bull, is back
down to the level of first year college
boy.

The rush week veneer is beginning
‘to crack, and the sharp guy you gave
the house to is carrying your laundry.
He'll probably begin to run stud next
week, and before long he’ll have to
sing for his supper and then give up

is dessert to a sophomore. He’ll make

three 100’s in a row on the pledge
manual tests, then take grilling from

the brothers because he got a ‘“‘D”’ on
Polley's bible.

It's going to be different next year
—sophomore rush, you know. No
pledges. But this sophomore rush {it’s
supposed to give the freshman more
time to get an education, strengthen
interest in extra-curriculars) is on
shaky ground right now. Most of the

over their spur-of-the-moment deci-
sion of last May. It can be brought up
at any future faculty meeting and vot-
ed upon again. And maybe they might
just vote the whole ugly idea right
back out.

We doubt it.

Unless. . . Well, heck, it’s too fan-
tastic to think about.

But what if pledges suddenly had
more time to spend on Polley’s bible
and debating and the newspaper and
the freshman basketball team?

Why, fraternities could cut out
stud-running and _ laundry-carrying
and paddle-signing. They could sub-
stitute a point system under which the
pledges earn that pin with decent
grades and participation in extra-cur-
ricular activities and intercollegiate
sports.

Well, heck, it's too fantistic to think
about. Everybody knows you’ve got
to harrass those boys to pull 'em to-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Court’s Use Of Chapel,
lts Methods Draw Scorn

Forrest Roles

Dear Editor:

In my short stay at David-
son, I am most disturbed by
the Court of Control. I have
made an investigation into ‘it
and here are my findings and
conclusions.

The three most commonly
stated purposes of the Court

“lare: (1) to Davidsonize fresh-

: trembling fingers, I

men to keep the “hallowed
traditions" of the college; (2)
to remove the cockiness by hu-
‘miliation;. and (3) to unite the
freshman class. These are wor-
thy aims, but they would
hardly justify the means, even
if they were accomplished.

in its efforts, the Court ig-
nores the first purpose, con.
centrates on the second, and
accomplishes the third. 1 is
impractical to hope to enforce
Davidson's traditions by force,
withouf a good policing system.
The Court simply does not
have this.

It can at most hope to pick
out the “cocky” freshmen and
humiliate them; however this
tends only to challenge the
freshmen to defy the Court,
thus encouraging cockiness.
But they need to unify for.
strength, and thus the fresh-
man class is unfied.

If the Court does unify the
freshman class, what's wrong

THE DAVIDSONIAN wel-

with it? The answer Is
means. I sec nbthing benefi-
cial in dragging an unlucky
freshman, whose only crime is
forgetting his beanie and hav-
ing an enemy among the up-
perclassmen, before the whole
student body to be_ hissed,
booed, and ridiculed for an
offence he has not been tried
for.

The Court’s Gestapo tactics
make a mockery of justice and
‘the Davidson Gentlemen.”
These tactics sre obnoxious
and degrade a college that ig
trying to be Christian.

Finally, I challenge the
Court of Control, and the Stu-
dent Council to justify this
hazing of freshmen either mor-
ally, legally, or practically.

It Just Doesn't Pay
To Try For Breakfast

By BILL ARMSYRONG

Some days it just doesn’t pay
to get up. Take last Tuesday
for example. Go on, don’t be a
coward, take it! I managed to
sleep through the alloted break-
fast hour at my fraternity
house, as usual, and so I had to
groggily make my way to the
College Union.

Here, I thought, here, In this
sanctuary for all men, here I
would find refreshment for my
famished body and soul, and
perhaps get something to cat,
too.

dropped my nickel into the slot.
“Glug-urk,
machine.
Frantically, I pulled a kneb,
ao particular knob, just any
knob, I hate breakfast anyway.
“Gugga, guggs,” moaned the
machine as it vibrated with ef-
fort. “Clank,” it west, “clank,

clink,” went the

elank.”

That was all. No candy, no
nothing. I pushed the coin re-
turn. “Ssss," hissed the ma-
chine in displeasure. No coin,
no candy, no nothing.

BIG GYP

Getting down on my knees,
I pushed my hand up into the
candy slot and wiggled my
fingers. “Grrr,” the machine
warned, and I beat a hasty re-
treat. “So, what's a nickel?” I
philosophied, counting my fing-
ers as I weakly approached the
coke machine.

With a bit of apprehension,
1 dropped my penny in the
coke machine. “Clash, Grunch,”
gurgled the machine. Next,
the nickel followed, “Blub-up,”
welcomed the machine as the
mechanism went to work.
Wheelo turned, bells rang,
gears meshed, and slowly, ma-
jestically o cup dropped into
view.

Joe Eifort

Dear Editor:

A week or so before I came
back to school, I got a letter
from the college concerning, in
part, chapel conduct.

I quote from this document:
“It is our conviction that our
proper procedure is not to elim-
inate these assembles but to
try to make them. better and
more meaningful.”

Last Monday, in the second
assembly of the year, we wit-
nessed a procedure in which
the purpose apparently was to
humiliate and intimidate sev-
eral members of the freshman
class. 1€ this was not the avowed
purpose, it was at least what
was accomplished in several
cases. Does it not seem that
there is some inconsistency?

Possibly the freshman regula-

tions serve a good purpose—
that is not my concern. How-
ever, it does seem that the Col-
lege readily permits activity in
chapel that is not in accord
with the word and spirit. of
that contained in the letter
which I received.
_ I quote again: “It is the be-
lief of the writer that miscon-
duct at these services is based
to a large extent upon bad hab-
its—. . :” It is unlikely that a
bad habit will be broken if it
is condoned.

CONS

Wide eyed with wonder, I
watched the machine as a light
flashed’ on and off. “Hiss,” the
machine urged, “hiss, hiss.”
That was all, just a cup and a
hiss, no coke, no coin, nothing.

Broken in mind and spirit, I
stumbled back to the snack bar.
But there, as in a dream, my
wildest hopes were realized.
For there, behind the counter,
stood a crew-cut young man,
eager and willing to serve my
every wish.

LAST STRAW

With one valiant effort, I
threw myself on the counter in
front of him and gasped out
my request, “A milk shake,
quick!"

A frown crossed his hand-
some face. “Vat est dast, shook
milk?” he asked. “How est dast
made?”

Like I said, some days it just
doesn’t pay.

By JIM TANNER

To beante, or not to beanie
... that is the question.

These memorable words, in-
spited by the presence of one
of said beanies on said writer's
head, might be called the topic
sentence in the paragraph of
this week's freshmen activities.

TOP CASTRO

These innocuous little ob-
jects have inspired more dis-
cussion, aroused more spirit,
kindled more rebellion, and
generally created more mental
and physical turmoil than the
Castro regime.

If such as these can arouse
young America’s blood to the
boiling point, think of the fever
pitch that could be reached
over something of real import-
ance—the banning of Bardot,
to cite one nightmarish possi-
bility.

Who says America has no
spirit or unity? How can any-
one say that the South will
never rise again, if the limp red
form of a beanie can bring forth
such waves of rebellion? Amer-
ica, take heart!

HEIL, HITLER!

The class of '64 is at hand—
out of hand for the moment,
perhaps—absorbing the knowl-

edge to be gained by riots,
beanie burns, and other forms
of higher education.

The implications of this re-
bellious freshman spirit are
tremendous and __ far-reaching.
Imagine the consequences if
Hitler had had such beanies to
arouse his troops! These little
felt fedoras obviously affect the
logic and emotional stability of
the wearer.

Who knows jJow many -un-
moulded young minds have
been led astray, how much po-
tentially useful brain tissue is
now ruined, squeezed into a
rumpled, twisted wreck by the
confines of a beanie?

BOOTLE OF PILLS

There is only one effective
cure for this rebelliousness to-
ward beanies: a bootle—pardon,
bottle—of bitter pills, which
are usually handed out free of
charge in assembly. These boot
. .. bottles are distributed by
a funereal group of Davidson
upperclassmen whose heads
apparently are so hard that
their freshman year beanie
wearing left them unaffected.
Regrettably.

Davidson .. . land of beanies,
forbidden pastures, and hi ya
education.

Editor’s Note: Dr. Aubrey N.

DR. AUBREY N. BROWN,

(} The

Jr.

Brown Jr., class of 1929, is the
editor of The Presbyterian Outlook. Through the years he has
maintained e@ continued interest in Davidson, and especially in
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

The years I spent at Davidson shook my world. No
class or professor or person can account for it. Nobody,
so far as I know, tried to give me a set of new ideas. It
was a time of upheaval in many ways, not the least of
which included implications of the Scopes evolution
trial in Dayton, Tenn., and the apparent downfall of my,
to then, hero, William Jennings Bryan, with his literal-
istic interpretation of the Bible.

At Davidson I came to understand something of the
unity of truth: truth in one sphere will never cancel out
other truth. This was liberating.

Unless we have our worlds shaken in some such way
we collect a strange assortment of habits of thought
and behavior, social conformities, reflections of our
environment. We may settle down with them for the
rest of our lives. in fact, we may do so anyway.

Today’s social revolution makes it almost impossible.
to keep the lid on the box of familiar ways we have
known and loved. We are being challenged to come to
terms with the status of people, the place of privileged
groups, and to look with penetration at all human rela-

tionships.

F. Scott Fitzgerald left the plot of an unwritten play:
Five widely separated members of a family inherit a
great house—if they can live in it ¢ogether!

This is a parable of our

world. We have to learn to

live with each other or this rich and wonderful world will

belong to none of us.

| congratulate this generation of Davidson students
on being realists. They know enough about history and
social change to understand that they must come to
terms with the new demands of our day.

They wisely want Davidson to be great in ways that
cannot be so easily described. They know that Davidson's
resources—traditions, money and solid families in its
connection—are not so much to be praised in our home
circle as cast in the balance in the demanding struggle

ahead of us.

These realistic students, it seems to me, are calling
for more intensive emphases along such lines as:

—rising above the regional and secular culture to
pioneer in fulfillment of our academic traditions,
Christian concern and domestic ideals;

--deeper student involvement in domestic and world

affairs;

—a sports policy, devoted basically to participation
and development of every student, and subservient

to sound academic goals;

— democratic expressions of campus living that will
become as famous as Davidson's traditional campus

friendliness.

Students see that rather than suffering for blazing
new trails, a college like Davidson lifts a standard that
will inspire many others. There are students, parents and
generous givers who are eagerly waiting to be challenged

y a college of such dedication.

I am gratefu: to Davidson. I am also convinced that
Davidsgn must be unique in its service to this generation

—not in some superf

cial, trival or commonplace man-

ner, but in the quality of its dedication to the highest.
