Kruse's Cubby:

Mascot
madness

By MIcHAEL KRusE
Assistant Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcats.

We’ve been dubbed such
since the 1920’s, when Charlotte
sportswriter Albert Potts, a 1919
Davidson graduate who thought
his alma mater’s quasi-nickname
of “the Preachers” left some-
thing to be desired, began calling
the teams‘‘the Wildcats” in his
stories.

The name stuck.

But that was then and this is
now. Weare currently immersed
in times of revolutionary turmoil
on our generally painfully con-
servative campus.

The Libertas reports a new
earthshaking controversy every
other week, such as the shocker
that people here smoke the weed.
Three wooden crosses are met
with a tirade of student opposi-
tion. Guys and girls don’t know
how to talk to each other. Throw
in drugs, alcohol, and raging one-
night stands to the typical middle
school social scene, and you have
Davidson. The only apparent
solution to this enigma is to form
a progressive co-ed eating house.
Co-ed halls? Nah.

Our mascot should not be
left out of this sweeping change
at the Big D. When we became
the Wildcats, our football team!
played Georgia Tech and Auburn.
Enough said. °

It’s time for a change. We
complain of national anonymity-
both academically and athleti-
cally-yet, we are one of 29 Ameri-
can colleges or universities who
call its mascot the Wildcats.

name for ourselves. No, not by
routinely producing Rhodes
Scholars and CEO’s, not by win-
ning 25 basketball games, not by
making it to NCAA soccer Final
Four which we are hosting. But
by creating a flashy nickname.
Unorthodox mascots can be ve-
hicles of creativity, PR gems-
waiting-to-happen. Household]
names, if you will.

Take these otherwise un-
known institutions: the Presbyte-
rian Blue Hose, the UC-Santa]
Cruz Fightin’ Banana Slugs, the
Western Maryland Green Terror,
And get this one: the Rhode Is-
land School of Design Nads.
Yesiree. Go Nads.

We, too, could be Vonwal
worldwide. We, too, could be
famous.

And unless you’re a Ken-
tucky or an Arizona, you cannot
hope to garner any sort of recog-

Now, if you’re the Nads, that's a]
different story.

So what should our new mas-
cot be? You make the call..

E-mail me with your brain-
children. I'll print some of the
best in the fall.

I say that we can make a}.

Signing off, til next year....

Lacrosse falls to Duke in final battle

Returning players, new recruits anticipate breakthrough year next spring

Sports Editor

Eight unanswered Duke goals
changed Davidson’s 8-7 second
half lead into a seven-goal deficit,

at a first-ever .50) season.

But the loss ‘didn’t dampen
their high hopes for the future.

“Ever since we [junior tri-cap-
tains Rebecca MacLean, Sarah
Hogan, and Allison Rhoads] were
freshmen we’ ve gotten better and
better,” Hogan said. “Next year
we’re going to continue [ improv-
ing] and have a winning season.”

The Wildcats went up 8-7
when Amanda Fleck beat the Blue
Devil keeper for her third of four
goals on the day with 23:48 to
play.

But Davidson didn’t score
again until 4:29 remained in the
contest, with Duke holding onto a
commanding 15-8 advantage.

“Today we could have beat
this team, There was a ten-minute
spurt in the second half where we
lost it,” Coach Mary Schwartz said.

“This is a young team, and
that will change. Our intensity and
focus has been lost a couple times
throughout the season. A couple
times we’ ve even pulled out wins,
but that’s not going to happen

against the better teams [like
Duke].”

MacLean, Hogan, Rhoads,
Erin Floyd, and Lisa Dorson all

‘mentioned fleeting focus as one of

the team’s problem areas.

“T don’t think we were tired.
Just about every game we have a
stretch of time like that [where
concentration is lost],” Floyd said.

“There was a little bit of a lull
and then we had to play catch up.
There was not enough time, and
we had few subs, but next year
we'll have subs,” MacLean said.

The Wildcats lose no one to
graduation next month and four-
teen recruits will join the squad
next year, providing the increased
depth to which MacLean referred.

“We’re going tobe really good
next year,” said Lisa Dorson.
“We’re getting a lot of good re-
cruits, losing no seniors, and our
coach is staying. I’m a junior and
we’ ve had a different coach every
year. I’m very happy with the
coaching, and I’m glad she made
the commitment. Everyone’s ex-
cited.”

Baseball makes early exit from league tourney

By Kevift’ ZVARGULIS

A season that began in Febru-
ary with high expectations, but
sputtered throughout, ended with
an appropriate thud on Friday af-
ternoon at the Southern Confer-
ence tournament in Charleston, SC.

The upset-minded Wildcats
(14-33) traveled to Charleston to

face Georgia Southern (37-9), the
league’s most dominating team and
top seed.The Eagles have soared
into the nation’s Top 25 recently,
going from unranked obscurity just
three weeks ago to the tenth ranked
team in the nation.

The game, pitting Davidson
senior ace Chris Pollard against
Southern Conference Pitcher of the
Year Julio Ayala, was never really

in question, as GSU won handily,
8-2.

Although Pollard pitched well,
the- Wildcats provided little sup-
port, producing as many hits (four)
as errors.

On the heels of Thursday’s
defeat, Davidson plunged into the
loser’s bracket and a Friday elimi-
nation contest with App. St. (27-
18), and Mountaineer hurler Dan

To make room for the NCAA soccer Final Four, Richardson Field devoured the
first three lanes of what used to be the track. Four years later, the plush turf is
surrounded by a pathetic pock-marked excuse for running space.

Stutzman, who entered the week-
endas conference ERA (2.24) king.

App. St. struck first, scoring
in the second on a Brett Berier RBI
double.

The Wildcats answered in the
fifth, when Anderson Marvin
stroked a two-out double and then
scored onaDom Talvacchio single.

Through the first six innings,
John Coulombe and Stutzman were
locked in a pitcher’s duel. In the
seventh though, App. St. took a 2-
1 lead. and had the bases loaded
with no outs, poised to have a big
inning.

Coulombe then struck out the
next two batters and appeared on
the verge of making a great escape.
But Brent Payton dealt the Wild-
cats a staggering blow, a bases
clearing double that sealed
Davidson’s demise. Davidson
never recovered on its way to a 5-
2 loss.

Talvacchio and Marvin each
had two hits in the losing effort.

The Wildcats had one all-con-
ference selection in right fielder
Luke Goodwin, who entered the
tournament with a .351 batting clip.

But the committee of head
coaches apparently overlooked
hard-hitting third baseman Gus
Quattlebaum, who ended the sea-
son with a .315 batting average
and 12 home runs.

Davidson plays two non-con-
ference contests this week, travel-
ing to UNC-Asheville on Wednes-
day and hosting Wofford on Fri-
day.
