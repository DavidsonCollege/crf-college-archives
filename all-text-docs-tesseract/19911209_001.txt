Croatia in frontof Chambers Build-

in a villagé just a few miles from
the Croatian capital of Zagreb, held
the vigil with about fifty other
Davidson students forabout twenty
minutes in an effort to show his
concern about the fighting in his
homeland.

“The goal is to express con-
cern and make people aware of
what’s going on,” he said. “I feel
-I should help my country as much

as I can while I’m here, and this is -

what I can do.”

some of their frustrations and
weren’t necessarily designed to
find solutions, but to let the com-
munity becomeaware of the prob-
lems on campus. Richard Terry
said that the administration “didn’t
want to pretend that from a dis-
tance we could understand every-
thing perfectly.”

The first forum was attended
by approximately 50 people, many
of whom were women and minor-
ity students, The second forum at-

tracted about 150-200 people and ”

resulted in numerous ideas for the
future. From now on these discus-

The civil war between the
Yugoslavian republics of Serbia
and Croatia began in late June, and
since that time, some 6,000 people
have died. Theconflictstems from
Croatia’s recent declaration of
independence from Yugoslavia
and from Serbia’s goal to recreate
the medieval “Greater Serbia” (a
geographical region that once in-
cluded parts of modern Croatia).

Serbia’s large, well-equipped
army holds the edge over Croatia’s
lightly armed militia forces, but
the growing number of casualties
are hurting both sides. ~

By Kevin Miller
The Davidson administration
recently announced the beginning
of a new fundraising campaign in
honor of the college’s most fa-
mous chemistry professor, current
North Carolina Governor James

~ G, Martin,

The campaign, The James G.

Martin Fund for Science Educa-

tion, will raise $1 million for the
new James G. Martin Professor-
ship in Chemistry and will also
raise additional money for the
creation of a science enrichment
fund for chemistry, biology and
physics.
Davidson President John W.

Kuykendall said, “The James G.

Martin Fund will fulfill two vital
purposes. It will help us keep pace
with the advance of knowledge

and technology to prepare our stu-_

dents for science careers, and it
will honor a most distinguished

public servantand Davidson alum-
~nus.”

receipt of his Ph.D, from Prince-

Davidson to teach from 1960-1972.
During his-years at Davidson he

next focus” and that there has also
been talk of a “lunch and dinner
series,” where students, staff, and
faculty could meet over a meal to
talk about campus issues.

solve the conflict since, “it’s not
the governments that suffer, it’s
the people. The European commu-
nity is working hard, but they’re
not getting a whole lot of under-
standing from either side, so more
diplomatic pressure is needed.”

The Croatians are especially
hurting. With the implementation
of Western economic sanctions,
depleting store shelves are hitting ...
the people hard. Also, Klenovic
said, the civilians are in imminent
danger of air raids. His home vil-
lage was lightly bombed twice by
Serbian aircraft.

said that the forum was successful
in that it “opened dialogue” and

“informed people about what has
been going on.”

The faculty passed a resolu-
tion this past week echoing their
concern for civility on campus.
The proposal was submitted by
Professor William Mahony of the
Religion Department, and was
approved unanimously. Before the
meeting, the faculty was addressed
by President Kuykendall on the
issue of campus tension. Kuyken-
dall expressed his dismay at the
recent incidents on campus, but

stressed the need to focus on the

positive.

“For many of us,” Kuykendall
said, “the current mood on campus
is particularly troubling against the
backdrop of a Statement of Pur-
pose and a generally accepted
mission for this College which
intends, a far nobler life together
than these episodes and sentiments
seem to express.” He went on to
say, however, “The point to focus
on just now, it seems to me, is that
we mean to: do better and to be
better; and we shall.” Kuykendall
also praised “‘student leadership in
general” in its effortto workagainst

Economics Professor .
Charles Ratliff to Retire

By Tom Koonce

“Dr. Ratliff symbolizes the
essence of what a Davidson pro-
fessor ought to be: scholarly,
compassionate, entertaining and
concerned about students; a per-
son who has high standards for
students and yet does not let those

~ highstandards get in the way ofhis

love for them as people,” saidDean
of Students Will Terry.

Atthe end of this month Char-
les E, Ratliff, Jr., the William R.
Kenan Jr. Professor of Economics,
will retire from his active teaching
at Davidson College. For a man
who has taught here for almost

forty-five years, his retirement is,
in his words, “traumatic.” ,

In 1947Ratliff graduated from
Davidson and was asked by the
college to teach accounting and
introductory economics that fol-

lowing fall. As his love for teach-
_ing developed, Ratliff went to Duke

University graduate school to earn
the credentials for teaching aca-
demicsat the college-level: He at-
tended Duke between 1949-1951
and 1953-1954 and received his
Ph.D. in 1955.

Besides absences for graduate
school, regular sabbaticals and
