Dr. Cunning ham Tells Students
Of Annual "Trustees Meeting

President States Tuition Increase
Necessary To Carry On

Dr. Cunningham delivered an

informal, within-the-family-talk

Tuesday morning after the chapel devotions. The fire-side chat
ineluded reports on a critical coal shortage, progress in building
the new church and the dormitory, possibility of a student union

building. inerease in tuition and room rent, and a raise

faculty salaries. _

“The most immediate problem of
the college,” Dr. Cunningham said.
“is that of a critical coal shortage.”
No more than a week's supply was
at that time available. It was hoped
that Mr. Jackson would be able to
find a car-load somewhere, but in
the meantime it was requested that
every effort be made to.conserve
heat in the dormitories:

A meeting of the Board of Trus-
tees concluded Monday, giving Dr.
Cunningham an occasion to speak
of their election, duties, and current
report.

The Trustees of Davidson Col-
lege, composed of 51 men, is the
largest board of Trustees of any
college of comparable size. The six
Presbyteries of North Carolina and
Florida elects a majority of the
Trustees; the alumni furnish twelve.

FINANCIAL SHORTAGE
Faced with an operating shortage
of $80,000. Davidson College will
raise its tuition $75 and dormitory
rent $25 next September, the Presi-
dent announced. The Trustees of
the college who authorized the, in-
creased rates, stipulated that 20 per
cent—approximately $15, 000 — of
the new revenue be used to help
needy,, worthy students obtain edu-
cation. This year the college paid
approximately $43,000 in scholar-
ship aids and $11,000 more for part
time jobs.
The $25 boost in room rent’ is
the first clfange in dormitory fees
in approximately 15 years. During
this time maintenance costs on
buildings have more than doubled.
Tuition charges have been raised
in the past ten years from $200 to
$300, a 50 per cent increase, while
the cost of educating each student
has jumped 180 per cent.
Despite the increases, Davidson's
fees are still Jow in comparison with
other, southern colleges. Tn announc-
ing the changes, President Cun-
ningham said that “even with the
new rates our tuition and fees will
be as low as any college controlled

by the * Southern Presbyterian
Church.”
New salary raises for faculty

members were quoted’ as being $2,-
500-—$3,100 for assistant professors,
$3,250—-$4,250 for assaciate profes-
sors, and $4,000—-$5,500 for full

After the Fire!

SABBATH BLAZE LEVELS HOME:
CLOTHES REQUEST ANSWERED

Sunday morning services were
interrupted last week by the un-
timely wail of a fire siren. When
the flames had finally been quench-
ed, John Lowery, his wife, and two
small children were feft homeless,
losing practically everything they
owned,

Mr. Lowery had arizen earlier
to build a. fire in the stove and had

gone back to bed. He apparently |-

fell asleep, for he was suddenly
awakened by an excited neighbor
who had seen smoke from across
the street, and realizing that Mr.
Lowery’s house was on fire, had
gone to investigate.

The response of the fire depast-.

ment was excellent, for although
the Towery home was destroyed,
the Davidson Volunteers arrived

soon enough to save the home of,

marked the first joint gathering of
the three fraternities composing the
Miami Triad, Phi Delta Theta, Beta
Theta Pi, and Sigma Chi, ever to
be held on the Davidson Campus.

The banquet, which was attend-
ed by Dr. and Mrs. Cunningham,
featured an unusual and interesting
program.

Bob Hollister, President of Phi
Delta Theta, opened the program
with a welcome to all alumni and
faculty brothers and all the dates
present. George Adams, President
of Beta Theta Pi, ‘next presented a
‘short review of the history of the

Effect of Radiation
Explained to Students

At two o'clock in the Seience,
Building lecture room, Dr. Alexan-
der Hollander, director of the Bio-
logical Laboratories of Oak Ridge.
spoke on radiation and its affects
on living organisms.

Dr. Hollander, born of .German
parents, did both his sundergradu-
ate and graduate work at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin. For ten years
prior to the war he was associated
with the National Health Institi-
tion in Washington.

The main question with which

‘Dr. Hollander dealt was, how much,

‘can man safely be exposed to
atomic energy. This work has been
going on through the usage of rats,
mice and of rabbits, with particu-
lar emphasis being placed’ on the
percentage of surviving aitimals.

Dr. Hollander brought uot the
following points .in his lecture.

Before the war man knew noth
ing of the effects of radiation of.
living cells, so special laboratories
were set up to study these effects.
Radiation can be judged in measure
by amount and in wave length. This
information was alinost all they
had at the beginning.

The biological division of Oak
Ridge is a part of the National
Laboratories Commission set up by
the government to experiment in
atomic rgsearch throughout =the
country. Many scientists were
brought in who were especially in-
terested in the subject of radiation
and its effects.

The Biological Laboratories at
Oak Ridge are faced by three ma-
jor problems, these being:

1. Cytogenetics.

2. Biochemical change.

3. Pathology.

Little is known in the way of ex-
periment concerning the higher an-
imals, man included. Due to the risk
of danger to human beings as well

as the time element involved (500
years would be required for the
study of this cycle in man in con.
trast to only ten years in nrice},

mice have been used for most of

Students from Carolina Inn have
been moved to the dormitories and
to the cardboard village as several
dormitory spaces and several
apartments in the village were va.
cated at mid-semester by students
who either graduated, transferred
or failed out of school.

spaces left vacant in the dormito-
ries at mid-semester, and in view of
the coal shortage, Carolina Inn
would be closed the rest of — this
year. However, when the enroll-
