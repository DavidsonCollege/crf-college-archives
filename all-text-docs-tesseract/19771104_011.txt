Dr.Erich Wruck wonders why more
americans do not use graphology and
lend credence to its conclusions. ‘I
didn’t take it seriously like Ameri-
cans, but once you see an expert, it is
amazing what you can see in your
handwriting. It is almost like going
to see a psychiatrist.

In Europe, handwriting analysis is
used not only for detection of for-
geries, but also for employmnet
purposes, particularly in the hiring of
managerial and executive personnel.

Wruck, a self-avowed non-human-
ist, recognizes that all people are
sinners, however, a large corporation
will look at “‘not whether the appli-
cant is a sinner, but how well he
controls his sins.’’

Thus in Europe when one is asked
to submit a hand written curriculum
vitae when applying for a position,
one may surmise that the application
will be evaluated by a graphologist.

The corporation will not act solely
on the basis of a recommendation
said Wruck, “‘because someone might
just want to get rid of him.’’ The
graphologist can even detect whether
the applicant is trying to make a good
impression with his application.

Training in graphology, u thd the
Ph. D, level is available in Germany.
But not everyone can do the grapho-
logy, concedes Wruck. ‘‘It takes
talent that you either have or don’t
have.”

The graphologist must put himself
in the shoes of the letter writer. ‘‘He
must almost start perspiring as that
person did when he wrote it.”

Klages, a Munich graphologist
even used the art to diagnose disease.
He saw disease as a matter of the
mind and not the body, therefore, the
written expression would reveal such
mental breaks.

Wruck was exposed to grapholo-
gical techniques in the 50’s when he
translated German graphological
texts for a professor of handwriting
analysis at the New School in New

York. Aside from teaching grapholo-
gy and consulting court cases, the
graphologist verifies signatures on
college board tests.

The man’s evaluation of Wruck’s
handwriting proved ‘‘so doggone
right, it was almost embarrassing,”
chuckled Wruck.

Although admittedly not an expert
graphologist, Wruck agreed to point
out some of the salient characteristics
that the analyst observes.

The graphologist prefers to draw
his analyses from a letter written with
a fountain pen on unlined paper. He
would also like to know the age and

whether the writer is left or right-
handed.

Wruck noted that printing, rather
than writing in script is usually
considered a sign of weakness. ‘‘This
person hasn’t left his’ Palmer-script
days.’’ The amount of margin left
about the page is indicative of the
person’s aesthetic tendencies.

If the lines have a tendency to
droop toward the bottom of the page,
the person is probably a pessimist,
whereas lines slanting up the page
indicate optimism.

On one sample, Wruck noted the
broadness and length of the portions
of the g’s extending below the line.
“If this person were a boy, I would be
concerned about my daughter,”’ he
said. The loops below the line as in
lower case f’s, g’s and p’s are
indicative of the sensual aspect of the
individual whereas, the loops of
letters above the line, such as | reveal
something about the materialistic
tendencies of individuals.

Slumber party slated for friday

‘We are a completely unstructured
group of nuts devoted to mischief,
magic, and madness,”’ said Emilie
Bryan.

Bryan, organizer of the Uncom-
‘ mitted Committee, a conglomeration

of free spirits different from any other

Union committee in its total lack of

structure, talks with enthusiasm a-
‘ bout the group.

The members feel that this freedom
contributes to the creativity they
desire.

So far this year the Uncommitted
Committee has bee responsible for
several events ranging from anony-
mous stunts and a Homecoming
Rendevous service to the recent
marshmallow roast.

Many students studying in the
livrary on the night of the roast
witnessed a committee caper when
someone ran through the building in
hot pursuit of 2 giant marshmallow.

the marshmallow roast itself, but also
to brighten the atmosphere in the
library. This ‘“‘mood-setting” is the
purpose of the committee.

A major Uncommitted Committee
event is coming up timorrow night.
They have planned a slumber party to
be held in the Morrison Room of the
Union. The crazy excapade will begin
at midnight...the witching hour.

They will have a myriad of games
and activities and will serve refresh-
ments such as hot chocolate, popcorn
and perhaps homemade cookies.

Those who attend may also watch

TV in the downstairs room or the
video tapes which the committee
hopes to get. :
' Seances and levitations are among
the many activities planned. They
man do such things as tell ghost
stories, give bakc massages, and play
“spin the bottle.”

Students who come should bring a
sleeping bag, a pillow, and any
records they want.

Although many of their projects,
such as_this slumber party, are

that is not always the case.

Bryan explains, ‘‘We want to make
the Union a place where people will go
»to see what is happening, rather than
go to because there is a planned
event.”

While they get the small funds
needed for their antics from the Union
President’s contengency fund, they
are not an official Union committee.
This is how the mestibers want it.

‘‘We want to maintain complete

flexibility and spontaneity to carry

out many little, uncostly activities
that will bring a smile to people’s lips
or a chuckle to their silence.”

On one occasion they promised a
ticket to the first person who could
sing the Alma Mater. Although no
one could do this, a girl stood on her
chair and sang Row, Row, Row
Your Boat to win the prize.

Each time they pull one of these
surprises, they have left the prople
laughing. This is what they are
seeking. “‘Atmosphere,”’ says Bryan,
“a warm, crazy, people-oriented one,
is our goal.”’

Nervousness of some degree may be
detected in how well the subject stays
on the line.

‘Oversized capital letters reveal
superiority complexes. Wruck finds
the ‘capi Jetter'I expecially re-
vealing.

Horizontal marks such as the lines
crossing t’s are indicative of drive or
motivation. Smoothly curved m’s and
n’s are characteristic of people who
are not outgoing, and-who are with-
holding from their environment. Con-
versely, jerky, peaked ones show a
more outgoing, extroverted tendency.

However, the graphologist is not

infallible. From one sample he gath-
ered the impression that the writer
was obese. In actuality, she was a
lithe, slender Freshman.

“Some even say that you can see
intelligence by how the person's
handwriting differs from the taught
pattern,”’ said Wruck. A great deal of
creativity would produce a style
greatly different from second grade,
triple dotted line cursive.

‘You should never analyse your
relative’s handwriting. You lose your
objectivity,’’ Wruck said.

Wruck’s chief concern about
graphology is that Americans recog-
nize it as a valid source of information
about an.individual when performed
by a competent graphologist.

“The Americans have this trait of
committing themselves in black and-
white. They would rather say some-
thing over the phone, because a letter
is evidence, a phone call is not.’’

The interest is obviously here; over
the years Wruck has loaned his
graphology texts to students, and
none have found their way back to his
office shelves.
