Popular Speaker Will Hold Two
Services Daily

Rev. Peter Marshall, of Atlanta, Geor-
gia, will conduct the annual fall Vesper
services to be held here during the week
of Oct. 29.

These services will begin on Tuesday,
ay twenty-ninth and extend through

iursday of that week. The meetings
are not being held, as has been customary,
from Sunday through Wednesday, due
to Marshall’s inability to leave his church
at such time,

During three days, Rev. Marshall will
conduct the regular morning chapel ser-
vices and special meetings held at seven
P. M,, the usual Vesper hour. If there
are any individual problems to be brought
to Mr. Marshall, special appointments
may be arranged with Albert McClure.
‘There is a possibility that fireside discus-
sion groups will be held at the “Y” after
the Vesper services, but no delinite plans
have been made to date.

Peter Marshall, a native Scot, gradu-
ated-from the—University of Glasgow,
Scotland, and came to this country about
eleven years ago. After studying at Co-
lumbia Seminary, in Decatur, Ga., Mar-
shall was called to his first pastorate in
Covington, Ga. At the present time, he is
pastor of Westminster Presbyterian
Church, in Atlanta, At his church, the
members of the congregation find it al-
most impossible to obtain a seat without
arriving a half-hour early. This past sum-
mer, Rey. Marshall spent nine weeks in
Scotland, his native country. This fall,
Marshall is conducting three other groups
of fall Vesper services similar to this
one,

HOMECOMING GRADS
WILL ENJOY MUSIC
OF J. POYNER BAND

The Pan-Hellenic Council is sponsoring
a set of Home-coming Dances to be held
on the eighth and ninth of November,
at the Charlotte Hotel in Charlotte.

The music will be furnished by Jimmy
Poyner and his band, who played at Vir-
ginia and Myrtle beaches this summer.
This orchestra played last year at the
Davidson Bowery Ball. Three new men
have been added to the orchestra and
Key “giles will be the featured vocalist.

The set wilf consist of a Friday night
formal dance held in the ballroom of the
Hotel Charlotte and will last from ten
until two. Due to the fact that there will
be a football game on Saturday after-
noon, there will be no tea dance. The Sat-
urday night dance will be informal and
will held from until
twelve, in the main dining room of the
Hotel Charlotte.

As usual there will be four no breaks
at each dance.

Honorary Fraternity Council
Adopts a Constitution At
First Meeting

———--

be nine o'clock

The Honorary Fraternity Council met
last Friday, October 18, Chambers
Building to consider the organization and
beginning of their plans for this year.
Previous Councils have not had a con-

in

stitution so the adoption of a set of by-
laws during the session was welcomed as
an important step forward.

Two seniors, A. A. Kuhn and Harvey
Glass, were elected vice-president and
secretary respectively of the Council at
the meeting. They were chosen from the
group of men representing every hono-
rary fraternity on the Hill.

The by-laws drawn up by
Carleton Chapman, Harvey Ross, and Al
Kuhn previously. In accepting them the
Council felt that its control would be ex-
tended to the benefit of the various fra-

ternities affected. The tendency in past

were

years has been for some of the groups
to become inactive, and the Council is en-
deavoring to help the situation with the
by-laws that are printed below.

Yow! To Make
Debut On First

Students Warned To Stay Away
From Post Office Boxes

The College humor magazine will make
its debut this year on the first of Novem-
The first will concern itself
with the lowly Freshman; and the
features depict various aspects of the life
of the unhappy Frosh.

The artistic decorations of the “Yow1”
will be made under the watchful eye of
“Hal” Overton, art editor of the publi-
cation this year.

The “Tunes” section will be the work
of R. B. “Dick” Vowles and his. staff.
Editor Downie was very, emphatic in re-
peating the desire of the staff to have
all freshmen who are in the least inter-
ested in coming out for the “Yowl” to
do so immediately. There is an oppor-
tunity for anyone-who will come and try.

More issues this year is the aim of
Editor Downie and his staff. It was an-
nounced that the second issue would prob-
ably come out just before the Christmas
Holidays, and that after the holidays an
attempt would be made to bring forth
the magazine more frequently than has
been the custom in the past. Downie
stated that in order to do this it will be
necessary to secure a stronger support
than ever before. |

An effort will be made to combine the
literary with the humorous in the Yowl
this year. The staff in following this
idea will print essays and articles con-
tributed by the student body as a whole.
In doing this the staff will be trying to
put the “Yowl” on the same plane as any
