By DAVID REICH

Davidson’s tennis team
opened its season during spring
break and is off to what coach
Jeff Frank terms ‘‘a great
start.’’ Frank’s optimism is
justified, for Davidson's 7-2
record. includes wins over Pen
- State and Swarthmore whom
the Wildcat netters had not
defeated ir four years. Thes
two victories also indicate a pro
mising outlook for the season
since Davidson defeated both o
these teams through aggressiv

singles matches 3-3.
Davidson’s recent match with

powerful North Carolina is an-

other basis for Frank’s opti-

mism. Although the Wildcat’

netters lost to Carolina 8-1,

several singles matches were

close and Davidson won its first
individual match against Caro-
lina under the direction of Jeff
Frank. Harry Griffith captured
the lone victory. defeating Cliff
Skakle 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 at the
number three singles spot.

team is to continue their winning ways.

Track team tallies two straight *

The Davidson track team
chalked.up its second win of the
season without a loss on Tues-
day by defeating undermanned
High Point College 92-53. The
Wildcats displayed great depth
in the weights and sprints,
Sweeping the discuss and shot
as well as the 100 and 200.

Sophomore Phil Gilbert en-
joyed a superb day by winning
three individual events (100,
200, and long jump) and run-
ning a leg of the victorious 400
relay team.

Other highlights included Co-
ty Pinckney’s school record
time of 16:16 in the 5000, Carl.
MacPhail’s 15% points in five
seperate events, and freshman
Dick Jones’ narrow win over
High Point’s Bill McCown in
the 110 meter high hurdles.

The most startling perfor-
mance of the day, though, was
undoubtedly senior Steve Jus-
tus’ astonishing triumph in the
400.

Justus, who joined the team a
few hours before the meet began
had not run extensively since
his final flickerball outing some-
time back in October. He never-
the-less managed to electrify
the crowd by surging to a
decisive lead in the first 200
meters and holding on down the
home stretch to win in 51.6.

Davidson had defeated stub-
born Washington and Lee in its
opening meet on the previous
Saturday. The contest was ex-
tremely close, but Pinckney’s
business-like victory in the
3-mile in 15:06 clinched the win,

[Gregg Strader]

and the Wildcats eventually
won, 73-72.

Doug Horn’s double victory
(mile and 880) was noteworthy,
but the day was primarily a
showcase for the versatile talent
of MacPhail, certainly one of
the school’s finest all-round
athletes.

The 5’11”’ junior took first in
the intermediate hurdles, se-
cond in the high hurdles, the
high jump, and the triple jump,
and ran on both the 440 and
mile relay teams.

Coach Karl Kremser is opti-
mistic about his team’s future.
The formidable Jarry Taylor
(hammerthrow) heads an emer-
ging weight corps, Gilbert and

—

man, and Appalachian as the
teams to beat. Fortunately,
Davidson has the advantage of
playing Appalachian and Fur-
man at home. Although David-
son has already lost an early
match to U.T.C., Frank feels
the loss ‘‘may prove to be
advantageous because we now
know exactly how hard we have
to work.’

Needless to say, Frank is
extremely pleased with the
team’s play. At number one
singles, Mike Barnhill has a 5-4
record with only three matches
being played on his stronger
surface, clay. Chip Bondurant
is tremendously solid at the
number two singles spot with a
8-1 record. At the number three
spot, Griffith has gained several
important wins while building a
7-2 record. At number four
singles, Jeff Lyle boasts a
successful 6-2 record. John
Trout at number five singles
has a 5-2 record, while Brian
Cooper and, Steve Holman alter-
nating at number six are both
winning consistently.

Frank describes his present
position as ‘‘being plagued with
the pleasant dilemma of having
at ieast ten solid people I’ can
confidently put in the singles
lineup.”

Frank is also impressed with
the doubles play of Bondurant
and Jay Gepfert at number one,

sophomore Terrazzo Wallace
lead the sprinters, Pinckney
and Horn provide solidarity in
the distance events and the
ever-present MacPhail handles
almost everything else.

An intriguing possibility is
Jones, who was nationally
ranked in the hurdles in high
school and has immense poten-
tial. With a few more weeks of
training, the Wildcats could
become a very respectable
team.

Davidson next opposes
Lynchburg College in a home
meet on Saturday, March 25,
the field events beginning at
11:00 am. Anyone interested in
judging or timing is invited to

come out end Jed, a hand.

NEWCOMER Terrazzo Wallace is a versatile. esa who broad
jumps and runs aprints for the undefeated Davidson track team.

SOPHOMORE Harry Griffith is currently playing number three
for the Cats and has only two losses so far. One of his eight wins
includes an impressive win over Cliff Skakle of highly ranked North

Carolina.
Barnhill and Gil Kayton at
number two, and Lyle and Rick
Johnston at number three. He
feels strong doubles play is the
key to winning close matches,
and he adds, ‘I have tremen-

doubles this year.”

Frank credits this early suc-
cess to the hard work the team
has put in since September. He
