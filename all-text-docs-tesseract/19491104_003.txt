FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1949

Among The Greeks

BETA THETA PI

Although gore for ever, Home-
coming of 1949 will long be re-
membered as a great one for Phi
Alpha’s sons of Wooglin. At 7:30
p. m., Friday, the week-end was
ushered in at a fine open house at
the home of Dr. and Mrs. Oren
Moore in Charlotte. After an hour
or so of delicious food and de-
lightful chatter, new faces and new
names had been associated and
old acquaintances renewed and the
stage was set for an enjoyable holi.
day. During intermission, hot cof-
fee and cocoa were dished out down
5 the house along with cold

inks, sandwiches, and everything
necessary to make intermission
party a success. After the dances,
with only the glow of cigarettes to
distinguish man from furniture,
Phi Alpha’s beautiful girls were
serenaded until heads began to nod
and a gratifying day was brought
to a close. That is, excepting stags
and pledges. The stags had long
since been in bed and the pledges’
work was just beginning.

right. aad early Saturday morn-
ing. Davidson had another theater
—in the forn: of .a large wildcat
whose insides revealed the inside
story of the DDP. Following the
dedication of the gy:n, the flam-
ing red ensign of Phi Alpha in the
capable hands of Brother J. B.
Stroud, assisted by Brother Gant
Carlton, led a remarkably large
and cheerful group of Betas in the
colorful Parade gf Progress. Short-
ly before, Brother Dave Anderson
had gladdened the hearts of all
by é¢oming in third against Ran-
dolph.Macon in the cross-country
meet. After the game, in which
Rrother Cliff Turner threw the
pass for our single tally, the chap-
ter met at Erwin Lodge for a
splendid buffet supper, featuring
hot fried chicken with all of the
trimmings. This again was the
work of Brother Anderson, board-
ing house manager superb. Sat-
urday night’s intermission was
complete with fun, food and fel-
lowship, and was highlighted by
the presentation of favors. All.
including many alumni and friends
whom we were delighted to have
with us, agreed that the week end
was a complete succss.

Since homecoming, the Beta
footbail team has continued unde-
feated, sparked by the brilliant pass-
ing of Brother Earl Smith and the
fine blocking of Brother Sam Joy-
ner and the rest of the squad. A
word of praise, 1 believe, is in

program this year with regards to
the good sportsmanship shown by
all concerned. This could be, and
so far this year, is one of the pri-
mary funciions of the program.
With the broadening of the scope
of activities, it will play an in-
creasingly important part in our
college lives and it is up to us to
take advantage of the opportunity
provided.

Along this same line, we as a
student body would do well to as-

similate criticism offered us and be’

the better for it. Phi Alpha sig-
nifies her willingness and looks for-
ward to taking part in the life of
an improved Davidson.

There weren't many new femi-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

PROFESSOR IAIN WILSON

Dunkirk Veteran Is
On Davidson Faculty

1 wonder how many of the
Davidsun student body know that
we have on our tacullty a professor
who is a veteran of Dunkirk and
D-day and who was also a Ger-
man hostage during the last war,
and a fornier’ officer on the staff
of Field Marshall Montgomery.

Professor lain, Wilson, associate
professor of Bihle is from Oban,

Argyle.. Scotland. He studied at
Marburg University in’ Germany

burgh in Scotland. From Ediu-
burgh, he reccived the Master of
Arts degree and the
Divinity degrec.

ter of Slamannan, a mining parish
in central Scotland.
In September, 1939, Prof, Wilson
joined the Britsh Army and for al-
niost all of his seven‘years in the
army, he was chaplain to the Ist
Battalion, the King’s Own Scottish
Borderers. It was while he was a
chaplain that he experienced the;

At the close of ‘the war, Prof.
Wilson was appointed to the staff
of Field) Marshal Bernard Mont-
goiftery as liaison officer with the
Evangelical churches in Germany.
Upon discharge from the army in
1946, he served for a year as head

In November, 1948, Prof. Wilson
left the Départment of Reconstruc.
tion to join his wife and children
in Lynchburg, Virginia. Mrs. Wil-
son is originally from Lynchburg,
They have a son, age 5, and a
daughter, age 2. Their son had the
unusual “distinction” of being born
during au air raid in London. Their
daughter was born in Germany.
During the early part of 1949,
Prof. Wilson lectured in the United
States. Davidson offers him his first
teaching experience.

When asked what his opinion of
Davidson was, Prof. Wilson said
that it was impossible for. him to
have an opinion as yet, because a
college sich as Davidson was en-
tirely new to hith, He said that
there were no small liberal arts
colleges in Scotland. He did say
that he was not accustomed to so

United States was the interest that
was shown in other people. In
Scotland it was entirely unheard of
for a person to be interested enough
in you to talk to you about where
you were from, what you had done
and where you had been; and he
said that even in an interview he
was just a little embarrassed to
talk so much about himself.

is as gross an assumption as that
of* Southerners who believe that
there was no America before the
establishment of the C. S. of A.
There were indeed several. publica-
tions antedating to 1884 and 1895,
which gave much local cotoring
of the pasi, These publications,
on the permandént reserve shelf in
the library, were established, rose
and receded long before the initial
issue of the Davidsonian was in
print.

The earliest of these papers
evolved from The Weekly Enter-
prise. This publication was edited
in 1883 by R. G. Sparrow ('88)
and was entirely independent of the
college concerning the representa-
tion or financial aid thereof. This
want-ad and train-schedule three-
colunmed almanac later became
“The Davidson College Enterprise,”
which maintained its independence,
but gave the student a literary out-
let. This paper was a three-column,
four-page, twelve-inch sheet con-
taining receipts, local news, college
notes, weather reports, and adver.
tisements. The Davidson College
Enterprise remained at Davidson
from 1883 to 1888, the length of
the college. career of Editor Spar-
row. To be noted in the first is-
sues ave articles on a new livery
stable. winter weather, horse
thieves, and the building, of the
neiy church. From this last article
we reprint:

“Refore the new church is
built we wish to recommend
one thing which we think is
essential to the comfort of the
congregation, and that is that
the church be heated by a fur-
nace.”

Undoubtedly, preachers of hell.
fire and damnation held this task
hitherto. Typical of Editor Spar.
row's local column is the follow-

ing:

“A gentleman who lives just

modeled after the Charlotte ObB-
server, having six  six.columned
pages. This publication, printed on
June 7, 1895, represented the
Davidsonian in its prenatal form
since it was ‘the first attempt at
journalism at Davidson with a com.
posite authorship and being rep-
resentative of a body. It was edited
by the sophomore class of 1895,
under the supervision of Dr. W. 5.
Currell, their English professor.
Even in '95 the publications did
hot escape the bitter sting of con-
structive criticism. The Southern
Railway, it was understood,
threatened to sue this “Weekly
Journal of Current Events” for its
completely naturalistic expose of
C. T. Hagan on an “Awful Col-
lision”’ of trains Numbers 102 and
38 near Greensboro on June 7,
1898. This headliner story is an
(imaginary?) eyewitness account
of the collision followed by “the
continuous awful hissing of escap-
ing steam, the hideous shrieks of
women, and the hopeless agoniz.
ing groans of the dying,” and a
description of the holocaust:

“From the midst of this were
issuing the most awful groans
and here and there would be
seen the bodies partly exposed,
some dead, some writhing in
agony, pinned down between
the timbers.”

However, this imaginative, creative
writer, along with his newspaper,
laid all journalistic precautions
aside by stating: “Timely Topics
is modelled upon the Charlotte Ob-
server. If anything is amiss in it,
readers are requested to blame the
model,”

Sprinkled thronghout the pub-
lication are social, political, and re- |
ligious discussions ‘on state, na.
tional, scientific, historical and local
affairs: An article dedicated to an
interview of Thomas A. Edison
produced an introspective question
and answer column on contempor-
ary situations arising from Edison’s
inventions:

“Will electric boats he used
to cross the Atlantic? Will we
ever be able to telephone across
the ocean?”

And oddly enough the question:

“Will the electric light ever

SEVEN SENIORS TAKE
GRADUATE EXAMS

The Graduate Record Examina-
tion, which is required by all the
leading graduate schools as a pre-
requisite for admission, was given
by Professor
Abernathy to seven members of the
senior class.

These seven students were R. W.
Clapp, Jr.. €. ‘VF. Davis, J. C. Cal-
houn, R. G. McLcod, C. A. Bur-
rows, G, Newton and HH. FE. Cof-
fin.

administer this examination in the
early pact of February to all seniors
desiring to take it.

A reflection of '95 spirit might
well be heeded by present-day
cheerleaders who could advan.
tageously add the following sopho-
more yell to their repertoire:

“Hoop la hil Hoop la hil

Rah zoo! Bah zoo! Rah zip!
pang

Let her go! 97! Boom! yah!
Bang!”

Likewise mirrowed in this paper
under “Davidson Doings” was the
stock punishment for students on
all peculiar holidays or homecom-
ings:

“April 27 was set apart for
field day, but early in the
morning it appeared as if. it
would set in raining and rain
all day. Consequently, the stu- .
dents were dejected.”

Too, an article, of interest was
one on a member of the faculty:

“The famous. speaker, Dr. A.
Currie, delivered an oration at
the Lyceum on Monday eve-
ning. At one time both orator
and audience were entirely ov-
ercome with emotion.”

F.ooking back into the article,
“In the Gloaming” of the ninth
issue of Volume V of The David-
sonian, one may read this cloquent
eulogy on Timely Topics:

“This paper is part of David.
