Gozinyas Get It

Well, there are two weeks
left in school, the volleyball
tourney just started, tennis
has not been run yet, and soft-
ball is only into the semis of
the double-elimination
tourney.

So with our computer-type
logic, we have decided to
cover the softball tourney.
(They're the only facts we
have.)

The heroes of the tourney so
far are those lovable drunken
misfits the amazing Gozinyas.
In the words of Alec (the
human double) Hoon the
Gozinyas are ‘‘getting it on’’.

No thanks to Alec who has
the uncanny ability to turn a
grounder hit to him at third in-
to a double. The Gozinyas
have whooped on the ATOs
behind the seven hit pitching
of Dave “Bong Ball” Kittrell
and the hitting of the kid.

The ‘ATOs then finished
their season on about as down
a happening as could be as
the 4th Richardson Beavers
crushed the turnovers 22-2. A
good season for the usually
“‘ocre”’ Zeroes.

The Delts were the other
early exit team in the eight
team tourney. Pre-tourney
favorite Q-12 was the first to
deal death to the Delts as they
crushed the footballers 13-7
while starting the game with

seven guys. The Delts obvious-

ly didn’t need that defeat for
an ego boost as they dropped
their last chance to advanta-
geous Arcadia 12-2 behind the
centerfield play of Tom ‘‘Jop
Pepitone” Tornee, and the
kneeless Jim Lowry.

Before that game the KA’s
had rebelled against supposed
Arcadia authority by dumping

on the playful independents 17-

7 with your basic 10 run rule.
Anchored by seniors John
Brandon and Frank Smith, the
KA’s are a slight threat to Q-
12.

Don’t tell Q-12 that, as a
matter of fact, I don’t think
anybody told them last week
end as they crushed the rebel
yells in a 13-0 whitewash as
Bruno the Wop twirled a sixhit
shutout.

Falcon, Jonesy and the
Beachball led the hitting
attack. The miraculous MG’s
managed a good draw despite
some incredulous worthless
play by former jai lai player
turned Jewish, Mark Wilensky
and were able to nip an eager
Beaver crew 3-2, destroying
the spirit of the Richardson
wimps.

However, Miles Glorious
ran into a couple of mobile
kegs of beer (i.e., the Gozin-
yas) on Thursday as Jim
Prince and Richard Drix Hen-
drix led a Gozinya romp in a
12-1 fashion.

But the MG’s are still in it
along with Arcadia, KA#1 and
