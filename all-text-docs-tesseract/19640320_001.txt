OfY’s Goal

Because contributions to the
Easter Gift Fund have fallen
short of the $2300 goal, the
YMCA is unofficially extend-
ing the period of solocitation
until spring recess. The goal
was expected te be surpassed,
considering that the Fund
collected $2800 in ‘62 and $3300
In ‘61.

Jeff Wampler, Gift Fund
chalrman, reported that those
who have contributed to date
have given generously but that
only a very small percentage
of the student body has par-
ticipated in the drive. The
emphasis during the remain-
der of the drive will be for a
small contribution by every-
one rather than large amounts
by a few.

The money will be donated
to Nevin’s Vocational Train-
ing School, thereby enabling
this school to build and equip
a new workshop. The school
provides training in manual
skills leading to partial and to-

Two Vie For Paper Editorship

Charles Dibble, from
Sumter, S. C., is a managing
editor of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN. Dibble is president of

the Conservative Club and a ©

past president of Philan-
thropic Literary Society. He
was a Wall Street Journal
scholarship winner last sum-
mer.

* * *

During the past year report-
ers have labored over stories
that never were set in type
while ideas for other articles
have lain undisturbed for lack
of space in the paper.

Four of this year’s issues have
had six pages, and in each in-
stance the paper was superior
to our usual issues. I am con-
vinced that a six-page DAVID-
SONIAN would be a more com-
prehensive and_ stimulating
newspaper. Moreover, for THE
DAVIDSONIAN to be published
continuously as a six-page paper
is feasible:

The budget will permit adjust-
ments. Increased revenue would
come from additional advertis-
ing space provided by the two
new pages. from a_ stight in-
crease in the mail subscription
rate, and from abolishing the
traditional $350 convention trip
for staff members.

One of the new pages would
carry general news, similar to
the first and fourth pages of the
present paper, while the other
page would handle editorial ma-
terial and sports copy on alter-
nate weeks.

News coverage of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN should include, of
course, all facets of campus life
in an objective and thorough
manner. But the interests of
members of the Davidson com-
munity stretch beyond the town

DIBBLE

limits of Davidson: THE DA-
VIDSONIAN should provide a
calendar of both forums and so-
cial functions on other cam-
puses.

The recent political insert
evoked praise from a number of
students, evidence that many
would like to see THE DAVID-
SONIAN peck out of its little
Piedmont shell. An enlarged DA-
VIDSONIAN would facilitate
an increase in commentaries on
national and state as well as
campus affairs.

Editorially, I would encourage
individual freedom coupled with
individual discretion and respon-
sibility both on the campus and
in the nation. THE DAVIDSON-
IAN should not serve merely as
the editor's sounding block:
rather the editorial page through
letters and articles should serve
as a forum of all campus opin-
ion.

My three summers of profes-
sional experience as well as
eight years on school papers
would enable me to edit a DA-
VIDSONIAN with firm, con-
structive editorials, objective
news stories, and entertaining
and informative features.

Charles Ramberg, a man-
aging editor of THE DAVID-
SONIAN, is from Highwood,
Ill. A Dana scholar, Ram-
berg is an economics major
and a member of Phi Eta
Sigma, freshman scholastic
honorary. He is assistant so-
cial chairman of Sigma Nu.

* * *

As a candidate for DAVID.

SONIAN editor, I offer both a .
program and an attitude to .

make the paper a more respect-
ed editorial voice.

Admittedly, the first function
of a newspaper is to supply
news. I have no complaint with
the present DAVIDSONIAN's
fulfillment of that role. I will do
my best to continue providing
readers with the fruits of re-
sponsible investigative reporting
as well as the basic news all
expect.

A newspaper's second func-
tion is to be a responsible edi-
torial voice. In that role THE
DAVIDSONIAN has failed to
live up to its potential under
recent editors.

Under the present system, edi-
tors speak on many subjects, but
seldom persist with one long
enough to effectively shape opin-
ions or stimulate action by stu-
dent groups.

This year’s best example of
the current haphazard approach
to editorial policy was the cam-
paign. to improve the library
that burst into full bloom in the
Nov, 15 DAVIDSONIAN and wilt-
ed after the Nov. 22 issue.

_ My program to make THE
DAVIDSONIAN more respected
editorially is to establish goals
which would be pursued with a
diligence now lacking. Such a
program would include ample
news coverage of problems and

RAMBERG

topics involved as well as edi-
torial comment.

When editorial campaigns be-
gin to be pursued methodically
and coherently, adjusting to the
disclosure of new facts, then
readers may begin to be con-
vinced that THE DAVIDSON.
IAN is truly a responsible edi-
torial voice at Davidson College.

The attitude I would bring to
the editor’s chair is significant-
ly different from that of the oth-
er candidate. The voter is con-
fronted with the clear alterna-
tives of a political liberal and a
conservative,

I believe this factor should be
considered for at least one ma-
jor reason. Continued intensified
efforts by the local civil rights
committee will without doubt
merit editorial comment. My op-
ponent stood in the forefront of:
opposition to the rights march
as author of the anti-march pe-
tition. My views are directly op-
posed to his.

If elected editor, I would bring
a liberal attitude to THE DA-
VIDSONIAN and an intensive
program to make jit a stronger
editorial voice.

WET BUT UNDAUNTED, THEY MARCH THROUGH CHARLOTTE

Marchers Meet Rain, Irain,
But Carry Out Rights Walk

The drenching rain poured down on Joe Howell and the civil rights marchers as
they paraded through Charlotte’s streets Saturday. For fifteen frenzied minutes, a

train, appropriately on the Southern Railroad. divided the

ers much more wetness and Howell much more worry.’

But while the train was an an-
noyance, the rain was .an im-
pediment to hecklers who might
have found it interesting sport
to hinder a demonstration on
behalf of civil rights.

The organizers of the march
feel that it was — despite the
train, raix, and pressure the
week before to call it off—a suc-
cess. And yet they did not get
the national publicity they de-
sired. Both Charlotte officials
and marchers agree that the
walk may have little effect on
the city's race relations.

What then did last Saturday's
uneventful march by nearly 700
college students and other civil
rights proponents accomplish?

In the words of two of the
march's organizers, it helped
build “a sense of community
and belonging for those who par-
ticipated."

“It was the closest thing to a
religious experience I've ever
had,"* commented one of the Da-
vidson professors.

Both Joe Howell, the David-
son senior who organized the
march that attracted delegates
from nine colleges, and Dr. Phil-
ip B. Secor, a political science
professor who helped plan the
walk, agreed this week that the
greatest impact will be on those
whose cheers shook the walls of

Coming For Y Forum

BY BRITT SNIDER
Dr. William R. Mueller, chairman of the English

department of Goucher College in Baltimore, Md., will
speak on “The Arts as a Challenge to the Christian
Faith” on Monday as the sixth lecturer in the current
series of YMCA forums on contemporary religious chal-

lenges.

The schedule for Dr. Mueller
will be identical to those of the
preceding speakers. He will first
address the student body at the
Monday morning chapel. This
will be followed by a coffee hour
and an informal discussion at 3
p.m. in the Morrison Room. The
forum will conclude that eve-
ning with an address by Dr.
Mueller at 8:15 in the Morrison
Room.

Prior to assuming his duties
at Goucher, Mueller served on
the faculties of the United States
Naval Academy, Williams Col-
lege, Santa Barbara College,
and the Woman's College of
UNC. He also has been recipient
of several fellowships. including
a Ford Foundation Fellowship
in 1953 and a Guggenheim Fel-
lowship in 1958.

Also he has written numerous
essays, articles, and reviews for
such publications as The Chris-

tian Century. the Christian
Scholar. Journal of English Lit-
erary History, Social Forces,
College English and Johns Hop
kins Magazine.

He has had published five
books, including The Prophetic
Voice in Modern Fiction, John
Donne: Preacher, and Spenser's
Critics: Changing Currents in
Literary Taste.

Mueller holds his AB degree
from Princeton University, his
masters degree from Harvard
University and Union Theolog
ical Seminary. and ‘his doctor's
degree from Harvard Univer-
sity.

His visit will mark the sixth
in the series of eight scheduled
forums. Dr. Will Herberg,
speaking on secularization, will
follow on April 21, and the se-
ries will conclude on April 30
with Dr. Ernest Lefever on pol-
itics.

and who trudged the soaking
mile to the Main Post Office on
West Trade Street.

“The deepest and most im-
portant part of the march was
the terrific amount. of under-
standing that was gained,’’
Howell commented. “Those
who walked are different peo-
ple as a result of having com-
mitted themselves this time.
Next time It will be easier.”
Apprehensive Friday night be

fore the march, Howell was
grinning broadly Saturday af-
ternoon as Biddle Hall's 450-
seat auditorium jammed to
overflowing. ‘‘This is great!‘ he
exulted.

A few minutes later, the stu-
dents gave Howell a-noisy. spon-
taneous standing ovation for
what Professor Ernest F. Pat-
terson afterwards termed his
“courage in the face of almost
insurmountable obstacles.”

Davidson, Johnson C. Smith,
Livingstone, Lenoir Rhyne, Ca-
tawba, Belmont Abbey, Queens,
Pfeiffer and Charlotte College
students participated. They

brought petitions signed by 8.300 |
urging President Lyndon John- {|

son to ptess for enactment of
the civil rights bill now before
the Senate.

in the Davidson contingent
were about 15 Negroes from
the community, eight profes-
sors and over 75 students in-
cluding nearly all the Rich-
ardson Scholars.

Demonstrating professors were
Secor, Max E. Polley, E. F.
Patterson. W. Brown Patterson,
J. V. Applewhite, Norman John-
son, W. H. Welsh and John D.
Kelton. Professor W. G. Work-
man, who said last week he
would march, changed his mind
when he learned of the position
of the Charlotte mayor, who op-
posed a march but favored a
rally. ‘

Davidson student and faculty
signatures on the petition num-
bered 338, nearly 100 more than
the anti-march petition picked
up on the campus.

Secor called the walk to the
post office to mail the petitions
**a Southern middle-class walk,”
with nearly all the placard-car-
rying marchers well-dressed and
well-behaved. ‘In this way, it
was really marked by the Da-
vidson character.” Secor ob-
served.

About the only evidences a
march of nearly 700 spirited
civil rights supporters was un-
der way were the bobbing line
of black umbrellas, occasional
strains of ‘‘We Shall Overcome”
heard above the noise of traffic
on busy Trade Street, and the
ubiquitous Charlotte Police
squad cars, their cherry-tops

parade, giving the march-

flashing.

After the. walk, the marchers
had plenty of praise for the
quiet. efficient way the police
kept the marchers moving with
minimum interference with
downtown traffic.

They had less praise for the
scanty coverage the Charlotte
news media gave the demon-
stration. ‘| would suspect
there was some desire to get
the thing over with as quickly
and as quietly as possible,”
Secor commented.

Monday afternoon one of the
obstacles to the march, Char-
lotte mayor Stanford Brook-
shire, breathed a sigh of relief
that there was no violence. ‘“My
only concern was in the action of
somebody throwing brickbats.
and that didn’t happen,’ he
said.

Dr. John R. Cunningham, Da-
vidson president-emeritus and
head of the Mayor's Community
Relations Committee in Char-
lotte, seconded Brookshire's

statement and added tha: he

thought the march ‘didn't make
any difference one way or the
other on Charlotte race rela-
tions.”

Jay Federman, who man-
aged the march, estimated
that Brookshire’s pre-march
public statements about poten-
tial violencs cost the march
the participation of ‘at least
300 students from white and
Negro high schools in the
area”

For at ‘least one marcher, the
march was a long - awaited
event: One white-haired. white
marcher told Howell, ‘I've been
waiting 18 years for something
like this ard now you've made
my life complete.”

For another demonstrator, the
walk was as exhausting as sat-
isfying. Said Secor. “I don't
care if I don't hear about civil
rights for the next six weeks.”
