The alumni will only have
one practice. session, laté
this afternoon, in which they
will be whipped into shape
to tackle the varsity.

Steye Heckard, executive
director: of the Wildcat Club,
is coordinator for the alumni
team, and is pleased with
the response so far.

sityalumni game at David-
son, replacing the tradition-
al red-white Spring conflict.

54 old-timers to play tomor-
row, including only 11 play-
ers from last year’s varsity
team.

35 of the -54 would be what
he termed ‘‘able-bodied.”

include Davidson Freshman
grid’ coach Gene McEver,
Bill Story, Croll Little, and
Heckard,

“Red” Wilson, the head
football Coach and Athletic
Director at Elon College, will
serve as assistant coach,

Heckard expressed con-
fidence in the team.

“T feel sure that we can
fill every position on the
offense with able-bodied play:
ers,” he said, ‘hut we may
rely on the varsity to help
out with the defensive posi-
tions.” :

Heckard discussed the re-
turn of several offensive
stars, citing especially Dan-
ny House (’61), who held the
all-time Davidson receiving

son, pulled a muscle ~jump-

ting in shape for the contest
tomorrow, Heckard said.

The repercussions of the
alumni game are intended to
last beyond tmagorrow atter-
noon.

“The primary purpose of
the game is to have fun,”
Heckard said, ‘‘but we also
hope to help get alumni in-
volved in Davidson.

Also the game will help

the Wildcat Club raise alumni

interest.

The Wildcat Club raises
money through aiumni do-
nations to pay for football

scholarships.

Working -during last year
the Club fell short of their
goal for scholarships for 1971,
and the trustees agreéd- last
week to pay the difference.

The Club has been raising
capital for the’ 1972 season
since January.

“We have roughly $50,000
out of a needed $160,000,”
Heckard said,” so we are
very pleased.”

The trustees felt that the
(Club should be allowed a
full year of fundmaising be-
fore any analysis of the pto-
gram. is instituted.

‘Next fail they avill review
the system to determine if
the Club’s funds should be
supplimented by the college
during the next four years.
