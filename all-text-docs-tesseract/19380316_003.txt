Professor Patton cited the dis
covery of the anesthetic properties
of cyclopropane, a gas derived from
petroleum products, by research
students of Purdue University in
1930. Since its discovery, this new
steep-producing gas has risen rap

be learned about this powerful new

\‘knockout drop’ but so far all ex

periments have demonstrated it to
be better in many respects than
either the well known ether or
ethylene gas

Professor Patton devoted the ma
jor part of his lecture to the tech
nical discussion of the imethods ot
preparation of the dpesthetic “and

]

the difficulties encountered in the

separation of the gas from its many
impurities. Many interesting point
in the chemistry of the various re
