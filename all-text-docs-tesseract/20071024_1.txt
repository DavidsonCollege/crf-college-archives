Protest lecture hits home | Officer to |

Tuesday evening’s lecture, led
by two 1960s civil rights activists,
drew a diverse crowd consisting of
a contemporary generation seeking
to learn and an older one hoping to
reminisce. The speakers engaged
the audience with vivid descrip-
tions and lots of interaction.

Former civil rights activist
Aubrey Brown pushed through
tears to recount tales of his experi-
ences with protests during the
1960s.

During his time at Union
Theological Seminary in New York
City, Brown first encountered
protesting when several students
decided that they were going to
picket outside a local restaurant in
an effort to integrate the lunch
counter. Brown also acknowledged
his less glamorous protest experi-
ences, recalling people spitting on
him and the gradual disintegration

of support from students and pro-
fessors.

“There was a quiet counter pres-
sure to the picketing—after a week
or two, there were only two of us to
carry on,” Brown said.

Persistence did lead to success,
however; the following fall the
lunch counters were integrated.

The experience taught Brown
that he was not meant to stay in
seminary, and a.few months later
he became one of the first Peace
Corps volunteers to teach in
Nigeria. After Brown’s experience
in Africa, he continued to pursue
graduate work in sociology at
Columbia University, also in New
York City. It was his time in NYC
that introduced him to the many
large-scale demonstrations in
which he participated. While there,
Brown protested against
Vietnam War and apartheid in
South Africa.

Last Thursday the Lake Norman
Chamber of Commerce, an associ-
ation of businesses, held the Town
of Davidson’s second election
forum. The forum took place in
Town Hall and featured both may-
oral and Town Board candidates.
Jerry Hancock, host of Charlotte’s
WTVI’s current events program
Final Edition, moderated the
debate.

Around 75 people, mostly mid-
dle-aged and older, showed up to
the event and were invited to write
questions for the candidates on
notecards. Hancock then relayed

the questions to the candidates.
The forum’s first section fea-
tured mayoral candidates John
Woods and William “Bill” E.
Jackson Jr. °57. Jackson was an
Economics-Political Science dou-
ble major, who later served as a
professor of Political Science at the
College. He also enjoyed a long
career in Washington which includ-
ed stints under two presidents,
John F. Kennedy and Jimmy
Carter. Recently, Jackson has
worked as a journalist, writing for
Editorial & Publisher and
Huffington Post (Arianna
Huffington’s website). Just this
year, the College awarded Jackson
its “Distinguished Alumnus

Award.”

Jackson has long opposed devel-
opment in Davidson and has said
that he is only running for mayor
because no other candidates
espousing his views decided to run.
His campaign slogan, founded
upon preserving what Jackson con-
siders the threats against
Davidson’s small-town character,
is “Keep Davidson special.”

A U.S. Army veteran and
Davidson native, Woods completed
his undergraduate education in
Business Administration from
Presbyterian College, received a
M.B.A. from the University of
South Carolina and attended the
Louisiana State University School
of Banking. Woods has more than
30 years of experience in banking
and is now the Senior Vice
President of Peoples Bank. Woods
worked on the Davidson Land Plan
Task Force. In 1994 he has served
on the Town Board since 1997 and
has been the mayor pro-tem since

2001. In the community, Woods

Chief Fountain Walker is running for Town Board.

has been involved with Habitat for
Humanity, the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church, Habitat for
Humanity and the - Davidson
Housing Coalition.

The debate took no time in get-
ting to the town’s major issue:
development.

“We want to keep Davidson a
small town,” Woods said in his
opening statement. “We also want
to make Davidson a self-sustaining
town.”

Conversely, in his opening state-
ment, Jackson said that he did not
recognize the Lake Norman
Chamber of Commerce as a legiti-
mate host of the debate, asserting
that “they don’t represent the peo-
ple.” Jackson also stressed the neg-
ative effects of development for
Davidson and the community’s
unawareness of these effects.

“T submit that you are in denial
if you live in this region,” Jackson
told the crowd.

seek office

By Curis Moore
News Editor

Fountain Walker, Chief of
Campus Police at Davidson
College, has dedicated much of
his adult life to public service as
a United States Marine, Police
Officer and Police
Administrator.

On Nov. 6 he will continue
| along this path by placing his
name on the ballot for Town
Commissioner.

Walker sees his candidacy as
“a continuation of [his] efforts
| to represent all citizens, regard-
less of economic standing or
historical boundaries.”

Walker sat down with News
Editor Chris Moore to discuss
, some of the prominent issues
facing the Town of Davidson.

Chris Moore: You oppose the
Davidson-Mooresville plan to
buy a local cable TV system. |
Can you explain why you are
not in favor of this idea?

Fountain: What we know is
very limited. We have had the
opportunity to attend a few
meetings and they have an
agreement that was signed by
the municipalities involved. The
issue is that when you’re talking
about acquiring something like
a cable company, for whatever
reason, you need to be able to
spell out to the people of the
community why and what the
true benefit is. Don’t tell me it’s
just better service. Tell me how
this revenue is going to impact
us in a positive way. Don’t tell
me you’re going to provide a
better service when you have
another entity managing the
system from Virginia. :

M: So will the cable company
not in fact be local?

F: The town itself will have a |
governing body that will com-
municate with the company in
Virginia but, ultimately, we
won’t have any control. So,
we're kind of backing the same
thing we’ve already got. We at
least know Time-Warner has the
resources and the equipment to
come out here. If I had the
opportunity to take a stand and
' get more community input and
the community speaks and says,
“No”, then that’s the direction
I’m going to go in. We need to
get the community more
involved. If you’re going to do
something that’s going to affect
the whole entire town, then you
really need to spell it out. A lay-
man should look at it and be
able to understand what’s going
on.
