~ “We have increased, but we
have not increased the number
of courses we're offering,” said

Terry was quick to. point out
that the fall term add-drop

; period, which ended Tuesday

with an estimated 2500 course
transactions having been made,
actually went much smoother
than last spring’s. -

He explained that many pro-

fessors take their sabbaticals in:

the spring and others take small
groups of Davidson students
-abroad as part of the College's
This reduces the number of
available courses even further,
of course, and visits chaos upon
the Registrar’s office during
add-drop, according to Terry.
Zimmermann said he wants
to avert a possible bottleneck
this spring but is not yet sure
what actions he will take. _
“We're still studying the
problems,” he said.

. Some of the things which he
has already done include mo-
ment classes to 1 p.m., when
most upperclassmen are cating,
so that the rest of the class day
will be less crowded by courses.

A computer print-out in

Burts’ office clearly shows that

many students do not get the
courses they want, not because
‘the courses are filled up, but
because there are time conflicts
with another class the student
has already received.

To Burts this is both one of |

the major problems in the
system and potentially the easi-
est to correct.

To prove his point Burts cited

a recent building utilization
study done among North Caro-
lina colleges which showed Da-
vidson getting the least good
from its facilities.
- Inreeent'years, he said, most
-classes have met at 9 and 11
a.m. and their rooms have often
been_left empty the rest of the
day.

To remedy the situation,
Burts said he has asked, in
writing all department chair-
men to hold some of their

classes_in the afternoon

Burts said traditionally there
has been an unwritten rule
against scheduling classes in
the afternoon, due to possible
conflicts with science labs, and
that for this and other reasons,
many department chairmen
failed to comply.

But he argued that now
two-thirds of the students do
not everi have.labs during 4
given term.

“There’s an attitude that
says.you have to keep the
afternoon free for labs. For
one-third of the students that’s
true; for two-thirds of the
students it’s not true,’’ said
Burts.

More courses are scheduled in
the afternoon this term, accor-
ding to the registration print
out, but Burts said only one is
scheduled in such a way that it
‘is still possible for its students
to take a lab course.

Terry calls for more courses to ease crowding

days a week in the afternoon, an
hour-and-a-half at a stretch
each session. Conceivably, his
students can"take a science
course with a Monday lab.

Although he originally de-
scribed the course to yapeier "
“an experiment,” Ratliff
has begun to see real advan-

in it.

In the first place, he said it
allows students to have more
time for his material to sink in
and, secondly, they have longer
to take his tests.

Burts said he hoped other
professors would adopt similar
schedules.

But even if they do, there will
still be a big registration pro-
blem left unsolved.

It is a matter of flippant
student attitudes, he observed.

Burts said some students get

A plea for aid

The first issue of Davidson’s nascent literary magazine, which}
has yet to be named, will hit the dormroom doorsteps in late] }
October or early November if its three editors have their way. .

Lyman Collins, Amanda Hall, and Greg Hankins said they
encourage everyone who is interested in writing poetry or short
stories, taking pictures or drawing, designing magazine layout, or
even writing book reviews and editorials to come to,.their meeting
this Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Morrison Room.

“Our magazine seeks to give exposure to the Davidson writer

who might not otherwise “get published,” said Collins.

status offenders. é

Status -offenders, according to Davidson PIRG Chairman
Chuck Gaddy, are children guilty of violating laws inapplicable
to adults. Running away, truancy, and disobedience are
example of status offenses.

The report was written in response to North Carolina House |
Bill 456 which provided funds for. . . “the development of
community-based alternatives to training school commitment.”
The law became effective July 1, 1978.

PIRG’s analysis, published in June and available nationwide,
- forwarded several suggestions outlining methods of treatment
proven to aid in the rehabilitation of status offenders. The
‘suggestions included: One to One Programs, Group Homes,
Emergency Shelter Care, Camping and Recreation Activities,
and School-Based Programs. Each modality is explained in
detail and already existing programs are cited.

The report, according to Gaddy, also includes statistics about
status offenders in North Carolina gathered from juvenile
courts, and evaluations of 3500 status offenders.

The Mecklenburg County Juvenile Services Division has
jurisdiction in the Davidson area.

Gaddy commented that results will not be expected for
some time due to the bill’s recent date of enactment.
