Cooke prepares for fourth year as baseball head coach

By Will Cobb

Now that baseball is officially
back with
spring training
beginning last
Monday,
Coach Dick
Cooke finds
himself going
into his fourth
, ear at
Davidson. Af-
ter his first
three years,
Cooke feels he has found the right
place to be. A long windy road has
found it’s way to Davidson for
“ooke, and very few will argue
how pleased the school and com-
munity is to have him here.

Cooke

A graduate from the Univer- .

sity of Richmond in 1978, Cooke
was selected in the summer draft
by the Boston Red Sox.

That fall he was sent to the
rookie league and played in Win-
ston Salem, NC. After working
himself up to AA ball at
Winterhaven, CT, he was released
in the spring of 1983 by the Red
Sox.

Following his run at “The Big
Show” in the minor leagues, he
returned to his alma mater in Rich-
mond as an assistant baseball
coach. He remained with the Rich-
mond Spiders for the next five
years, leaving to rejuvenate a dead
program at Belmont Abbey Col-
lege. Baseball at Belmont had been

dead for almost 20 years. Cooke
spent the fall of 1988 and the spring
of 1989 organizing, recruiting and
scheduling so that competition
could begin on the NCAA level in
1990. All of the hard work came
through and baseball returned once
again. The program still exists,
growing more and more competi-
tive each year.

Though Cooke worked hard
to bring baseball back to Belmont
Abbey, he accepted an offer from
Davidson in the summer of 1990.
Cooke describes Davidson as “a
great place to live and raise a fam-
ily.” Cooke adds, “There’s a lot of
great things about being here, deal-
ing with true student athletes, and
working fora college witha strong

commitment to academics.

Final season records do not
reflect the talent and success of the
baseball program.

Davidson plays an extremely
demanding schedule. Of this year’s
50 games scheduled, 12 are against
the ACC (the nation’s highest rated
conference), along with 24 confer-
ence games. “Southern Conference
baseball really stacks up, there have
been 2 representatives to the Col-
lege World Series in the last five
years (The Citadel and Georgia
Southern) and one other came as
close as you get (Western Caro-
lina) last year. There is no one in
our conference or on our schedule
that is a guaranteed win,” notes
Cooke.

Cooke is very optimistic about
this coming year as there are 6
probable returning senior starters
in the field to offset a pitching staff
that lacks experience, but at least
he only has to worry about his
players when they are under his
supervision. “There’s a lot to be
said about having players focussed
academically, and not having to
worry about them off the field.”
Believe it or not, baseball is back
again at Davidson, and Coach Dick
Cooke is ready. ;

With an experienced team and
, the Wildcats are set to play a
prominent role inthe southeast this
season. Coach Cooke is certainly
the man to lead them to that im-
proved role.

Manning ready to bring in new era of women's lacrosse

“I love Davidson and
I love my players. I
expect a lot out of
them this year and
they know it.”

By Will Cobb

For those students who spend
any amount of time in the Baker
Sports Complex, an unfamiliar at-
tractive young female blond may
have caught your eye. Her name is
Kerstin Manning, and she is no
ordinary blond as she has taken
over the head coaching position
for women’s lacrosse.

She stands as the only new
head coach at the helm among the
additions to Davidson’s coaching
staffs for spring sports. A graduate
from Maryland University in 1993
in Speech Communications, she
has wasted little time, moving to
the south last July after living in
the north for her whole life. Man-
ningcomments, "The transition has
not been difficult Coming from
Maryland and Philadelphia, it is
nice to be in a community like
this.”

After growing up in Philadel-
phia, she decided to play college
lacrosse at Maryland, a perennial
powerhouse. As a four year mem-
ber of the varsity squad, Manning
enjoyed unparalleled success,
reaching the Final Four every year.
In 1990 and 1991, the Terrapins
finished in the runner-up position,
but in 1992 they achieved the ulti-
mate, capturing a National Cham-
pionship. 1993 was a tough year by
comparison for Manning’s final
season, as the Terps finished third.

Along with the team honors,
Manning tallied a slew of indi-
vidual honors that is absolutely
incredible. She was named to the
NCAA All-Tournament team in
’92 and as a first team All-Ameri-
can in ’92 and ’93. Last spring,
Manning was given the prestigious
honor of being named the NCAA
Division I Defensive Player of the
Year. In addition to these colle-
giate honors, she has been a mem-
ber of the United States Women’s
Lacrosse Squad since 1991 and
this year was selected to the U.S.
World Cup Training Squad and
the U.S. Women’s Lacrosse Elite
Squad.

After playing at a national
powerhouse, one may find it
strange that she has moved out of
region to coach at the smallest Di-
vision I school in America. “I’ve
coached at a lot of lacrosse camps
during the summer. I got a lot of
satisfaction from taking a bunch of
strangers, having them get together
as a team and then becoming suc-
cessful. In these experiences, I felt

extremely comfortable in coach-
ing positions,” said Manning. An-
other important reason she is liv-
ing in North Carolina has to do
with her fiance Jack Kimel, who
livesnear Winston Salem and plays
minor league baseball for the
Charleston Rainbows in the Texas
Ranger organization in Charles-
ton, SC.

Under the warm smile and

pretty face is a serious competitor
that is strictly business when it
comes to lacrosse. Not often does
Davidson enjoy the pleasure of
having an All-American among
us, so the next time you see that
unfamiliar pretty blond in Baker,
approach her and make her feel
welcome.

She has to get used to being
called “Coach” Manning.

Victory over UTC more than hard-fought

Mens continued from page 17

throws at 11:45, the Moccasins

_had turned a 7-7 tie into a 23-7

lead. Several missed shots and
turnovers by Davidson led to tran-
sition baskets, mostly 3-pointers.
During that run, the Moccasins
threw down four long shots to put
the Wildcats on their heels.

But after the break, the Wild-
cats executed better on offense,
which in turn strengthened the de-
fense by not allowing fast-break
opportunities for UTC. The big
spurt for Davidson was a 14-2 run
four minutes into the second pe-
riod that erased a 13 point lead to 1.

Tarheels are great, but we go to Davidson

ably playing some top-20 team on
national TV. If it doesn’t happen
this year, it certainly could within
the next several. That’s not too
much to hope for.

Nouldn’t that just be unbe-
lievaole? Maybe not quite as re-
markable as ascholarship-less soc-
cer team going to the Final Four,
but pretty neat nonetheless. Its the
guts and hard work of Davidson’s
coaches and athletes that make its
programs successful, and when
success comes its a joy to behold.

If there’s anybody who per-
sonifies the spirit of Davidson ath-
letics, its sophomore point guard
Chris Alpert. The guy hits a game-
winner the other night, then nails
the clutch three-pointer to knock
UTC out on Saturday. Alpert is the
kind of player every coach wants
on his team - he’s a leader, a hus-
tler, a solid defensive player and
he’s got ice water in his veins.

I’m sure a lot of folks have
had fantasies about walking on to
o their college team, becoming a

starter and hitting winning shots in
big games. Alpert, the walk-on and
former non-scholarship player, has
done all that in making himself an
integral part of a blossoming pro-
gram.

There’s no way that he’s satis-
fied though, he wants to keep on
winning.

That’s what it takes to be a
college point guard on a competi-
tive team: the desire to compete,
the ability to lead, and the willing-
ness to scratch, claw and fight for
every minute ofa game. Ibet Coach
McKillopis tickled when he thinks
of how spoiled he is to have a guy
with those kind of characteristics
on his team.

I wonder if the Davidson stu-
dent body realizes how spoiled it is
to have a team like this to pull for.
It may not be the Atlantic Coast
Conference, but these players are
just students like us who happen to
be winning some pretty impres-
sive ballgames. They’re making
believers out ofa lot of people, and
if you’ve seen ‘em play you’re
probably one too.

So here’s a message'to that school
over in Durha . we’ve got our
own 678” forward from Reston,
VA and our own gutsy point guard
from up north. To that school in
Chapel Hill: we’ve got a guard
who can put the ball in the basket
too, and we’ ve got a small forward
who can jump through the roof,
too, just like you do.

And let me do alittle tinkering
with the Transitive Rule of Bas-
ketball here. Davidson beat
Clemson, which beat Wake For-
est, which beat Duke. Davidson
also beat N.C. State, which beat
Georgia Tech, which beat North
Carolina.

If Carolina is fourth in the
country and Duke is second, does
that make Davidson the nation’s
best team? Probably so.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the
Carolina-Duke game on Thursday
night, it should be a doosy. Re-
gardless of which shade of biue
you prefer, remember that nobody
on this campus should be a true
Duke or Carolina fan. We should
be Davidson fans. :

A big factor in the run was Will-
iams, who scored 10 points during
the 4 minute span. But the biggest
difference in the second half was
the Wildcats’ defense.

“Our defense really picked up
in the 2nd‘half,” McKillop said,
“But part of it was we executed
better on offense, which slowed
them down and they didn’t have
many transition shots.” The teams
went back and forth until the Wild-
cats had the lead at 69-68 with 1:08
to play. A UTC time-out with 43
seconds left set the stage for the
final frantic minute. _

The play was designed for
Alpert to dribble time off the clock

outside before finally passing into
Narat at the post. In the event of a
double team, Narat was to kick the
ball out to Alpert for the open
jumper. And that’s exactly what
happened, as Alpert drained a three-
pointer to take a 4 point lead. Born
hit a 3-pointer
from way out, but then Alpert
dribbled out the game.
Saturday’s game came after
Davidson came back froma 19-
point deficit to win at Georgia
Southern Wenesday. “We got
down a little bit early on and we
cameback,” Alpert said, “But, man,
we’ve gotto stop getting down like
that.”
