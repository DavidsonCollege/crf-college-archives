In the debate last Saturday night in
the Eu Society the affirmative was up-
held by Brown, Bellingrath and F. M.
Mitchell. The negative was upheld by
Harwood, Hobson, Hollandsworth and
Humphrey. The debate was more spir-
ited than usual, yet, as several of th:
speakers were appointed on, it lacked
preparation, which the Reviewer
brought out in his criticism.

On Monday morning Love gave a
declamation, ‘'The Farewell Address of
Jefferson Davis in the Senate.” ‘Those
giving orations were: F. M. Mitchell
“The Submarine Nets;” D. V. Hudson
“A Startling Discovery ;” S. R. Keesler,
“The Military Camps;” <A. Brown,
“Home Rule for Ireland.”

In the Phi Society on last Saturday
night the regular weekly debate was
held, the subject being, “Resolved, Thai
the United States should abandon the

Monroe Doctrine.” The affirmative
was upheld by Murray, Robinson,
Campbell and Cumming, while the

negative was presented by W. C. Neel.
H. T. Lilly, Mann, Ratchford and R.
H. Stone.

The affirmative upheld their argu-
ment on the grounds that the Monroe
Doctrine is founded on false principle-
and has made South America unfriend-
ly; it is no longer necessary; and a Pan-
American League would result in a bet-
ter policy.

The negative opposed them on the
grounds that changed conditions make
the Monroe Doctrine as necessary as
ever; the South American Republics arc
not yet able to withstand European ag
gression; it has been the basis of our for-
eign relations; and entangling alliances
should not be made. *

On Monday morning Murray gave
an oration on “The Use of the Armored
Tractor in Modern Warfare.” Decla-
mations were given by Query on ‘“Ad-
dress to the Confederacy,” and by Men-
zies on “The Leading Nation.”

HON. W. H. TAFT SPEAKS
TO N.C. PEACE SOCIETY

Dr. Martin was in Greensboro, N.
C., last Thursday as a delegate, appoint-
ed by Governor Bickett, to hear ex-Pres-
ident Taft discuss the principles of the
League.to Enforce Peace, of which so-
ciety Mr. Taft is President. Dr. Mar-
tin had the pleasure of dining with Mr.
Taft at the home of Mr. E. P. Whar-
ton, the President of the North Caro-
lina Peace Society.

Mr. Taft lived up to his reputation
both as a genial gentleman and a most
interesting platform speaker. At the
dinner he talked delightfully of his past
experiences of Governor of the Philip-
pines, and of his work as conciliation in
Cuba, as well as his present work as
professor in Yale University.

His public address dealt first with the
present world situation and our relation
thereto, and then with the League to
inforce Peace. He believes we will
have war, and considers this «most
rious and solemn time in our coun-
try's history. It is a time when every-
one should face the duties of the hour
most seriously.

Mr. Taft believes in universal mili-
tary training. both to insure a reserve of
trained men, which can be called on
when needed, thus preventing the neces-
sity of using untrained bodies of men
with resultant heavy slaughter, and to
increase the all-around manhood of our
young men. The distinguished speaker
was never more in earnest as when he
spoke of the lack of respect of the young
men of our nation for constituted law
and authority, and evidently viewed
this and the lack of patriotism and wil-
lingness to sacrifice for the government
with alarm.

His exposition of the League was
clear and convincing. “If.” said he,
“America takes the lead in this, it will
be established after this war, but if
America does not, the other nations will
not, probably can not, because of mut-
ual suspicion.”

The large hall was packed and the
great audience in hearty sympathy with
the speaker.

PROFESSOR CURRIE SPEAKS
AT Y. M.C. A. MEETING

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting ‘on last
Thursday night Prof. A. Currie was
the speaker, the subject being ‘The
Plan of Salvation Viewed from a Hu-
man Standpoint.”

Professor Currie began by saying that
the way of salvation was a subject that
we should not shrink from discussing or
speaking to each other about because it
vitally affects our present life and im-
mortal existence.

The speaker next compared the way
of salvation to a contract, and defined
the contract as a mutual: agreement be-
tween two competent persons, whether
sealed by word or sign. Many examples
were given of the means by which « con-
tract might be made and agreed to. ‘The
two kinds of contracts were emphasized
—the bilateral and the unilateral. In
the bilateral each party agrees to do
something for the other. In the uni-
lateral one party promised something to
another as soon as the other has done a
specific thing.

God's plan of salvation, he pointed
out, was simply a unilateral contract in
which God promises to give eternal life
to anv man as soon as he shall believe
on His Son. Ratified by the seal of
God, there is no change in this contract.

In closing Professor Currie urged the
value and the necessity of every man ac-
cepting this contract which God offered
by which we might obtain eternal life.

Rev. W. L. Walker, pastor of the
Presbyterian Church at Cornelius, will
conduct the prayer meeting service of
the local church tonight.

COLLEGE RIFLE CLUB
MEETS FOR ORGANIZATION

Ac a meeting Saturday afternoen of
about one hundred and fifty member:

of the student body, together with a few

citizens of the town, in the moving pic-

ture building, the organization of a
Davidson College Rifle Club was
effected. Dr. J. W. McConnell was

present and presided over the meeting.
B. 1). Roddey was called on to state the
object of the meeting, and said that the
club was in no sense to be a military or-
tanization, and was simply to promote
good markmanship, It was emphasized
that members of such a club would bi
in no way under obligation to the gov-
ernment in case of war. Dr. McCon
nell also stated that there would be an
organization of a Civilian’s Rifle Club
with about twenty-five members.

‘The students present decided to or-
panize a College Club, and officers were
President, A. C.
Wood; Secretary, B. D. Roddey ; ‘Preas-
urer, L. M. Currie; Captain, H. B.
Fraser. ‘The duties of the officers are t
be the same as for any other organiza-
tion except that the captain is to have
charge of the shooting and of the gen-
eral management of the range. “The gov-
ernment is to furnish cach five men a
rifle and six hundred rounds of ammuni-
tion, the privilege being given to secure
further supplies at cost. [It was an-
nounced that Captain Morrison, of
Mooresville, would coach the club and
act as judge in the meets that would be
held.

It is not known definitely how many
men will join this club, but possibly a
conservative estimate will be between
fifty and seventy-five.

While as yet no definite arrangements
have been made by the college for the
return of Professor Fulbright next year,
it is to be hoped such plans can be com-
pleted. The need of the college stu-
dents for assistance along lines of pub-
lic speaking has been more and more re-
alized of late, and the increased efficiency
of the students has justified «a further
course in this work.

HIGH SCHOOL TRACK MEET
HAS BEEN CALLED OFF

It is with much regret that the stu-
dent body learns that the high schools of
Western North Carolina will not hold
their annual mect at Davidson this year.
Much interest was taken in the meet
last year bv the students and all hoped it
would be held again. Ie seems that
these contests are under the supervision
of a committee at the University of
North Carolina, and for some reason
they have called off the meet in: West-
ern North Carolina.
