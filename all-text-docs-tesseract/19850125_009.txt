IMAC Basketball: A-Teams Match Up Evenly

By HUNTER GOURLEY
and SCOTT HUIE

The A-league, though small in
number (only nine teams), is big on com-
petitiveness. Post-Christmas play leaves
everything up for grabs: no teams remain
undefeated, no teams winless.

On the first school day of the new

year, SAE’s second team, the Far Side,’

earned its first mark in the win column in
a 42-37 squeaker over Basket Case, a
Pax team of renowned volleyballers.
They aren’t bad at hoops either. Far Side
used its well-balanced attack against the
Cases whose big gun was Bill Bigger,
with a 14-point performance. Mean-
while, amongst other E-baggers, the Hod

Squad kept its win streak intact, wearing
out the Old Men, 53-34. Senior Scott
Brandon banged for 17 points and Dr.
Tom Kazee was held to four buckets by
the Hoddy D.

PiKA’s sophomore team, Three Sec-
onds, held its own in the lane against the
Satterwhite-less defending champs, the
Supreme Court of KA, 56-47. J.D.
Fleenor and Rob Ellison combined for 29
points to close the case. The brothers of
Cool Breeze grabbed their first victory of
the season, toppling Far Side 43-38 be-
hind Keith Ellis’ 10 points.

In other action, Death by Ru-Ru, a
fearless contingent of freshmen, de-
feated Becca and the Huts, 59-50. The
contest featured former Wildcat Billy

Naso, who hit for 15 points, and Jim
Sowerby, who drove the lane for 19

points in a losing cause.

A week later, it took four O.T.’s for

the Hoddy Squady to dispose of Ru-Ru,
50-48. The E’s were missing Brandon,
but Tony Cabrales filled the void, sink-
ing two clutch free throws in the waning
seconds.

The Court was Supreme over the Old
Men, 56-41, behind Michael Holt’s 17
points. Bill Giduz juggled his way to 10
points for the Old Men.

This month’s upset belonged to Pax’s
Basket Case which nipped previously
unbeaten Three Seconds, 37-36. Losing
his breakdance ability, Rick Greene
found his J, tossing in 11 for the winners.

The Old Men bowed to Becca’s Huts,
60-59. Will Cardwell’s picture-perfect
jumpshot accounted for 18 points for the
PiKAs. The Huts also disposed of the Far
Side, 52-39.

Elsewhere, the Old Men rebounded
wtih a 40-30 trouncing of Basket Case,
with Kazee banking in 16. Three Sec-
onds downed Cool Breeze, 68-53, be-
hind Alan Futral’s 23 points. Ru-Ru
fought off Far Side, 47-45, in a well-ba-
lanced attack.

And finally, the KA-SAE rivalry was
as intense as ever, but the Milk Drinkers
prevailed, 41-40, behind Stephen Doc-
kery’s 14 points.

Yes, ladies and gents, A-League
means satisfaction!

Women’s Basketball
Breaks Streak With Win

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson's women’s basketball team
has some good news and bad news for the
rest of the school. The good news is the
team ended a 30-game losing streak with
an 88-81 win over Meredith. The bad
news is the women are 3-7, including
two forfeit wins over Converse, and have
a long way to go before winning becomes
the rule instead of the exception.

“I’m pleased with the effort and im-
provement by the team,” said Coach
Patty Daley. “Our turnover rate has im-
proved amazingly and we are scoring a
lot more points. Our scoring is higher be-
cause everyone is contributing and we're
moving the ball up the court better.”

Sophomore Heather McKee has been
one of the Wildcats’ strengths. McKee is
averaging 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds
per game, both team highs. Junior co-
captain Amy Hartman is averaging 12.1

points and leads the team in assists with
57 over eight games. Sophomore Mary
Griffith is the other player averaging in
double figures. Griffith is scoring 10.3
points a game for the Lady Cats.

On Tuesday night, Davidson hosted
Coker College. Unfortunately, Davidson
was inconsistent offensively and its por-
ous defense allowed Coker to prevail,
90-80. McKee led Davidson with a stun-
ning 35-point, nine rebound effort. Grif-
fith added 14, mostly from long-range.

The Lady Cats’ main problem is re-
bounding or, to be more specific, block-
ing out under the boards. Coker was dif-
ficult to stop because it generally got two
or three shots when it needed them.

“| thought we could have played
much better,” Daley said. “We were
rushing on offense and not getting the
shots we wanted to get. It looked like we
were going through the motions.”
