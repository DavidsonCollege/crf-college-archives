Williams discusses future o

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Since last July Dr. Robert C.
Williams has served Davidson
College as Dean of the Faculty,
Vice President of Academic Af-
fairs, and Professor of History. A
native of Boston and a graduate of
Wesleyan University, Williams,
who holds a Ph.D. in History from
Harvard University, has written
‘and edited a dozen books and

nearly seventy articles on various -

topics such as nuclear power,
Russian art and history, and linear
algebra. Before coming to David-

son, Williams was Professor of
History at Washington University
in St. Louis for sixteen years and
served as Chairman of the History
Department and Dean of Univer-
sity College at Washington Uni-
versity.

In his nine months at David-
son Williams has already underta-

ken an active role in the develop-
ment of the academic environ-
ment of the college. As chairman

of the Educational Policy Com-—

mittee, Williams has coordinated
the faculty’s efforts to propose an
extensive overhaul of the calendar
and the curriculum. Williams has

T
-

also substantially upgraded the re-
view process for faculty tenure.

I asked Williams to reflect
upon his experiences of Davidson
since his arrival nine months ago
and to:comment on the future of
academic life at Davidson over the
next few years.

Davidsonian: What made you
decide to come to Davidson?

- Williams: I come out of the
liberal arts tradition, having done
my undergraduate work at Wes-
leyan and having taught for five
years at Williams College, and I
felt that the liberal arts were in-
creasingly taking a back seat at
Washington University in St.
Louis where I was before I came
to Davidson. I was increasingly
disappointed in a large research
university which was really be-
coming a medical research corpo-

ration, with what appeared to be a
diminishing emphasis on good

teaching «andthe liberal arts. So -
the chance to play a leadership -

role at a good small liberal arts
college really appealed to me.

Davidsonian: What im-
pressed you most about Davidson
on your first visit?

Williams: I came down here

and literally fell in love with the —

place last February, mainly. be-
cause of the people. Both my wife
and I were struck by the fact that
we remembered people’s names.
Normally that’s difficult for us.
Yet everybody we met at David-

. son we liked.

Another thing that struck me is
that Davidson has a Statement of
Purpose. A lot of colleges don’t.
The sense of mission is an inheri-
tance from the Presbyterian tradi-
tion, which is really just abso-
lutely invaluable for Davidson.
This is an era when a lot of col-
leges have gone in for the latest
fad, in terms of technology or
profit-making. It struck me from

the very beginning that Davidson ).
was quite clear about what it ~

wanted to do and what it didn’t
want to do. It wanted to be a very
fine. liberal arts college. It didn’t
want to be ‘pre-professional,

graduate, or market driven. I re-.
ally liked that, realizing the im-

portance of the liberal arts in a
civilized society.
Davidsonian: What do you

believe is the importance of the:

Recent actions by the anti-

apartheid group Students Against
Apartheid have caused the issue of
the college’s policy toward South
Africa to become one of concern
for many students. The real re-
sponsibility for Davidson’s in-
vestment policy falls to the Trus-
tees, whom group members feel

- have been very vague in their

dealings with the problem.
However, according to Presi-

-dent’s Office spokesman Rick -

Love, S.A.A. has not been suc-
cessful in communicating any of
its views, except “Divest!”,to the
Trustees. In addition, he says, the
issue is “not that simple;” there are
many people who believe that di-
vestment is the wrong solution to
the problem.

_ In the past few weeks, mem-
bers of S.A.A.-have been very ac-
tive in calling attention to the issue
of apartheid and school policy to-
ward the divestment question.
Each day for the past four weeks,

S.A.A. members have held Signs
in front of Chambers with slogans
such as “Apartheid Subsidizes
Our Education,” or “Our Educa-
tion Benefits From the Slaughter
of Children.” This week also
marks the second week of the Red
Ribbon Campaign, meant to en-
courage solidarity among students
who feel strongly about apartheid.
Other activities have included cir-
culating petitions asking the Trus-

“tees to take action and a vigil dur-

ing a Trustees’ reception and dur-
ing the Fall Convocation.

For the upcoming Alumni
Weekend, they plan to pass out
lists of Trustees’ addresses and
encourage students to write letters
asking the Trustees to take action.
The group meets every Friday at
2:00 p.m. in Assistant Chaplain
Brenda Tapia’s office to discuss
their efforts to educate themselves
as well as the rest of the campus
about the effects of any proposed
actions toward South Africa.
