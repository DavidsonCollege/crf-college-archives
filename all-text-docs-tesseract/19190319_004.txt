IDENTIVY DISCLOSED

curiosity may have been aroused over the
actions of a gentleman who seemed to be
diagnosing the campus for the past few
days, it is stated that this was Mr. Ben-
son, of the W. A. Daniels Co., who has
been on the Hill getting a bird’s-cye-view

on display in the book. .rooni, will be
used in the new catalogs which are now
being printed. Plans are under consid-
eration for the getting up of attractive
advertising matter to be sent’ te pros-
pective new students in order that they
may get a fairly accurate idea of what
Davidson is and of what is going on at
this institution, but as yet nothing deti-
nite has been determined,
