Smith Specifies Means to Increase College Diversity

Alden Smith was inaugurated as
SGA President Feb. 9. Excerpts
from his inauguration speech are
reprinted here.

Over the Christmas break, I
had an interesting conversation on
an airplane with a young woman
from Minnesota. I was explaining
to her that - No, Davidson is nota

junior college, but actually a fine °

liberal arts school with an out-
standing academic reputation. She
said - Oh, itmustbe like Washing-
ton and Lee University, which she
then explained is much too conser-
vative for her blood.

Now I happen to be of the
school of thought that Davidson is
a better college than W & L, and it
concerns me that the image of
Davidson is often being compared
toother conservative institutions. .

. Today’s implications of the
word “conservative” are many —
traditional, exclusive, hesitant to
change, single-minded,
homophobic, etc. Some of these
words may indeed apply to
Davidson,

If an institution’ is only as
strong as its weakest link, Imay be
justified in fecling concerned about
this school I love so much.
Davidson . . . has a weak link.
There may or may not be gencral
agreement that one cause of our
relative lack of cultural diversity
on this campus is Davidson’s ap-
peal to a certain type of student. .

vative more often than not?

Recruiting Diversity

One reality that looms over
any liberal arts college in the South
1s that diversity is expensive. Ex-
tensive financial aid, merit schol-
arships, and other financial re-
sources are essential for attracting
high-caliber students of diverse cul-
tures. These are resources that the
Admissions Office must have suf-
ficient access to.

Sometimes! think of Davidson
as a good college with great inten-
tions. We intend to recruit diver-
sity, but the trustees put a cap on
the amount of financial aid we can
give just last Spring. I believe that
the Admissions Office (now under
new leadership) is doing all it can
to recruit minority students to

_Davidson: Ialso believe that effort
and vision are not enough. The

Statement of Purpose is an exclu-
sive document, especially to non-
Christian students and faculty.
Among other things, it says that
one of Davidson’s primary pur-
poses is to develop students of
“Christian character.” This state-
ment is simply no longer true.
Although we still maintain a close
and positive relationship with the

Admissions Office musthave more
financial resources. It’s up to the
students to voice this concern to

diversity in the academic curricu-
lum — the need for more social
options (namely a new student
union where we all feel comfort-
able hanging out together) . .
These are examples of the kinds of
issues that the SGA will make a*
stand on this year.
Making a Stand
I have made a heavy assump-

share my dream of diversifying
Davidson, but I refuse to attempt to
represent absolutely everyone. I
am not a politician. Sometimes
you’ ve just got to make a stand.

I also realize that diversity at
Davidson is not a new issue. Di-
versity is my personal focus for the
SGA because I want to mobilize
student government to be a cata-

Presbyterian Church, the curricu-
lum does not seek to make students
more “Christian.” We need to
modify the Davidson’s Statement

tion in this speech that most stu-
dents at Davidson want more di-
versity. I realize that there is a
minority of students who do not

lyst for less talking, less Task Force
Reports, and more action. I’m not
offering any promises. Just my
best.

of Purpose, so as to include every-
one in the college family.
Non-Discriminatory Clause

Purpose is the college’s Nondis-
crimination Policy. Adding sexual
orientation to this policy would
not change the atmosphere of
Davidson, but it is a long overdue
step towards inclusiveness.

This trustee cap on financial
aid — this exclusive nondiscrimi-
nation policy and: Statement of
Purpose — the relative lack of
