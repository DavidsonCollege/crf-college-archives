THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 17, 1925

Fresh-Soph Finals
to be Held Monday

In the semi-finals of last week the team
from the Pandeinic Society decisively de-
feated the Metrophilian team, while the
Philanthropic bunch nosed out the Eu-
meneans. These two victors, the Pan-
denic team upholding the affirmative with
the Philanthropic team defending the
negative, will wind up the fall debating
season Monday night, the twenty-first,
each in a desperate try for honor. The
Pandeinic representatives are J. R. Gra-
ham, K. Pritchett and W. M.-Regan, all
Freshmen, while those representing the
Philanthropic Society are F, A. Phillips,
L. K. Pritchett and R. B. Walters. The
question to be argued, which is the one
that has been used throughout the pre-
liminaries, is, Resolved: That the United
States should cancel her Inter-Allied
War Debts. Members of the faculty will
act as judges. From the six debaters the
best speaker will be selected who will re-
ceive the Fresh-Soph award.

The idea of having the tryouts in the
fall instead of the early spring, as has
been the rule, has met with general ap-
proval of all. The Forensic Council
especially has been well pleased with the
debating material discovered, for these
debates have ben a way of gtting a line
on prospective varsity men, and some
promising candidates have been found.

SIGMA UPSILON MEETS

Accordance With Yuletide
Spirit

The Y vespers next Sunday will be
somewhat out ofthe ordinary. The en-
tire service will be in the nature of a
song service with appropriate Christ-
mas music. The Glee Club has arranged
for several choruses and also selections
by the Glee Club quartette. In addition
to.this there will be music by the Glee
Club-orchestra. Additional selections will
be given by a mandolin and guitar trio.
This is the first time a program like this
has been tried but with the co-operation
of the students it should prove an inspir-
ing service.

The chapel will be decorated with dec-
orations appropriate for the season.
There will be no speaker for the occas-
sion and the entire time will be given to
the singing of Christmas hymns. This
is the last Sunday before Christmas and
it is hoped that this last service of the
year will be the best of all. A special
invitation is given to all the students to
come and take part in the meeting.

Three All-State Players Will Grad-
uate—Prospects Bright

Prospects for the Wildcat team of
1926 appear more brilliantly than ever
, before now that sixteen lettermen have
announced their definite intentions of
returning. Only five of the members of
the Wildcat team of last season will not
be present at the initial practice next
fall. These are Hendrix, Baker, Vance,
'Laird and McComb. These five are some
of the best and strongest of the Wildcat
players, and their loss will be a severe
blow to the Davidson machine. Ander-
son is as yet undecided but it is very
probable that he will take his place
along with the rest ofthe linemen next
If he does not return, it will be a
severe blow to the middle portion of the
line, since it will mean that only one out
of the four tackles receiving their letters
this year will return.

All three of the Davidson men mak-
ing the mythical all-state team will be
lost to the team next year. Baker and
Vance, two of the best linemen in the
state will not return, and Hendrix, the
fleetest back in the Carolinas, has al-
ready played his allotted four years. |
| Laird, who has been starring in David-
son games ever since that famous run of
his against V. P. I. back in 1922, will never
again don the old red jersey ofthe Wild- |
cats. The red head of McComb will not
|flash through the opponents for neat |
gains during the season of 1926 as it has |
/in former years. |
| Although many of the star players will
{not be in school next year, there will be,
‘many members of this year’s squad at
early practice next fall. Captain Black,
| Captain-elect Wells, Dick Grey, Harri-
son, Nisbet, Hewlette, and Leggette will |
| be the nucleus around which Coach Monk |
| will build his back-field next year. The
three varsity ends will all be back and
the wing positions will be well taken |
care of. The tackle positions will be!
nicely taken care of, if Anderson returns, |
since Ritchie, the other letterman will |
also return to fill the position left vacant
by Baker. The guard and center posi-
tions will be filled by McConnell, Grey
and Melton,

year,

Besides the members of this year’s var-
sity squad, there will be the fresh team
of this year to draw from. Two star |
players of the fresh team of '24 have also |
; anounced their intentions of returning |
and should make strong bids for berths |
on next year’s eleven. These men are |
Robert McMillan and Ed Wilson, both |
| of Charlotte. |

| Although it would be foolish to pre- |
dict a successful season at this time of |
'the year, one cannot help but see that |
| Davidson will have a great deal of good |
| material back next year and should pro- |
duce a smooth-running and efficient ma- |
chine. And with Coach Monk behind a |
team it is safe to predict that the ag- |

gregation will fight to their last breath. |

(Continued from page 1) |

The following are the high spots in the
colorful athletic career of the captain-elect : |

1922—Did not go out for fresh football. |

Exchanges

The students of the College ofthe City
of New York voted by an overwhelming
majority for the removal of compulsory
military training. The final vote was
2,092 in favor of the petition and 349
against.

The undergraduates at Yale College, af-

‘ter a week’s open discussion, voted over-

whelmingly in favor of abolishing com-
pulsory attendance to all religious serv-
ices, including chapel. Two days of bal-
loting resulted in a vote of 1,681 for and
241 against. They have. petitioned the
faculty to take this matter up and settle
it for all time. Following this the Penn.
College Collegian is also carrying on a
compulsory chapel campaign. It states
that the desire is first to get the opinion
of all the students and then if they want
it abolished a petition will be sent to the
authorities.

A new social club, “The Baronets,” has
been founded at the University of Flori-
The formation of this club shows that
the University has realized and is meet-
ing a need, evolved from the tendency to-
ward fraternity, or group isolation. The
object ofthe club is to promote cordial
relations between the respective mem-
ber fraternities which belong to the or-
ganization, and through this to foster
Florida spirit and tradition.

Columbia students, according to Pro-
fessor Moore of Dartmouth, who made a
nation-wide survey of student views, are
the most radical in the United States.

DAVIDSON DELEGATES

except the finances of the student body. It
was decided that it would be impracticable
and Mr. Sprunt was asked to serve.

“How about twenty bucks, Dad?”
“No thank you, son, you’d better keep
it, you'll be broke next week.”

“You get out of a mirror just

what you put into it.”
Good logic, we'll say.

Same way about a suit or over-
coat. If you put enough into
it you get fine, all-wool fabrics,
correct style and expert tailor-
ing. Although we’ve never been
accused of being the highest
priced place in the world, we
do admit that our clothes cost
a little more than the ordinary
kind. But our clothes are not
ordinary, and you get one dol-
lar’s worth of service and good
looks for every dollar you put

into them.
