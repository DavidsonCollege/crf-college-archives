Honors College House
Receives Little Support

By DICK ANDERSON
Associate Editor

The college proposal to
transform the Carolina Inn
into a place.for the Honors
College, presently located in
the Eumanean Hall, arouses
little passion among Honors
College members.

“Tf they're going to reno-
vate the building, I have no
strong feelings one way or
another abéut who gets it,"
said Dr. Earl R. MacCor-
mac, Professor of Philoso-
phy and Honors College Fa-
culty member.

“We don't need it. We

would like kitchen  facili-
ties and more _ space,
though,’’ said MacCormac,

implying that these would
be provided by the renova-
tion scheme.

‘Honors College Dean Fron-

tis W. Johnston said that
the honors group was aware
of some questions which
had been raised in connec-
tion with the proposal and
had discussed them.

According to him some
persons are concerned With

the ‘psychological effect. of °

removing the Honors College
from the campus proper,
which might create an” im-
pression of purposeful separ-
ation. ;

-‘We have no desire to be
an elite group,’’ he said.
“I'd like to see them do
something with the” build-
ing,’ Johnston added: ‘“‘I
am--very. pleased with the

plan that has been drawn.— ©

T have no further suggestions

whatever.”

Recently, the Carolina’ Inn
has been used by a group of
‘young townspeople as a

a

“teen-canteen” for social ac-
tivities.

Johnston said he would
like some more space, a

The trustees also directed
that Queens College be
studied as a possible ave-
nue for the implementation
of co-edycation. Davidson
and Queens appointed a
joint committee to consider
such a proposal, but the com-
mittee, according to Spen-
cer; has not been active be-
cause “we were caught in
other things in the fall.”

Spencer emphasized that
the committee will be more

active in the future, how-

dining room, kitchen facili-
ties and seminar room,
which the ‘Carolina Inn_re-

novation would provide.

Unlikely

ever,

Spencer also said that he
felt the present coed ex-
change program, which
brought 10 women from four
Virginia schools to David-

son in the fall, has been suc- .

cessful.

The present renovation of
Gray House on Main Street
is ‘primarily for the pre-
sent co-ed exchange pro-
gram,” Spencer said, and
should not indicate any im-
mediate plans by the col-
lege to go coed:

in the form of summer in-
ternship in business, govern-
ment, or institutional activi-
ty.

The Fellows will indicate
the type of summer activity
they hope to pursue, and the

Institute seeks to place them’

in such positions.

posed to a vere of other

Spring Studies.
Offer Options

By DAVID HANIG
Copy Editor ;

Writing an one-act play,
flyfishing, going on an ar-
cheological dig in Palestine
or the U.S., a log of readings
in science and mathematics,
and working with a trade
union are all possibilities for
fulfilling the Extended Stu-
dies requirement listed in a
guideline released to stu-
dents yesterday.

Over 200 projects are list-
ed in ‘‘Extended Studies 1
and 2: Guidline II,’’ prepar-
ed by the Office of the Vice-
President for Academic. Af-
fairs. Included in the guide-
line are the regulations af-
fecting Extended Studies.

(Most Extended Studies
options are more convention-
al than those above.: The
student may still take an
«area examination, a regular
course, or do a project of
his choosing.

Typical topics are a study
-Of the impact of new sci-
ence on 7th century cul-
ture, war and the Christian
conscience, allied interven-
tion in Russia, and the east-
west cleavage of Charlotte.

Another Extended Studies
option will be a project or
examination based on the

scripts of the Clark ** Civili-
zation’’ series, which will be
shown at Davidson from
April 14 to May 26. :

Extended Studies will be
considered the equivalent of
regular courses in quantity,
quality, and content,  usual-
ly taking 150 hours to com-
plete.

Extended Studies ‘nave
been designed for comple-
tion in the spring term. A
student may, with the. per-
mission of the appropriate.
area, committee, complete
the Extended Studies during
any other term if there is
sufficient .reason to do so.

3 is

Extended Studies projects
will be graded on a pass-
fail basis by whatever
means the student, the
sponsoring professor, and
the area committee agree is
appropriate to the nature of
the project.
