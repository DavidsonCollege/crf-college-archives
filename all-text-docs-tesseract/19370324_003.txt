RECALLS ‘D’ INVITATIONS

Baseball Used to Be Most
Popular Sport

“Life’ on the Davidson College
campus has greatly changed since
I was a student here,” stated the
Rev. A. L. “Buck” Currie, who con-
ducted the spring Y. M. C. A. sery-
ices last week.

“When I was a student,” contin-
ued Mr, Currie, who graduated in
the class of 1921, ‘a number of boys
were still living in old Chambers
and in Old Louisiana, a dormitory
which had from Dr,
Shearer's house, which was located
just across the $freet from Shearer
Hall and which is now torn down.”

During Mr. Currie’s college ca-
reer the “D"” Club was a very active
organization and_ inflicted
and harsh initiations. After “giv-
ing the works” to the new men, the
members the club rushed the
dormitories and hazed whoever they
might find, Mr. Currie states that
he remembers that during his sen-
ior year, he went with several mem-
bers of the “D” Club into the room
of Prof. E. A. Beatty, who was
his class-mate, and made him get
on top of the table and dance and
sing.

“Baseball,” he continued, “was
the most popular sport on the cam-
pus. Football was also» popular,
though it was not played on the
large scale that it is now. During
my sophomore year Davidson had
three representatives on the All-
America football team.”

Mr. Currie held the
rate at the First Presbyterian
Church Huntington, West Vir-
ginia, for the past four years. Be-
fore accepting this charge he was
pastor of a church in Kentucky, and
later in Nashville, Tenn.

“The flood waters from the surg-
ing Ohio just .missed my church
about fifty yards,” stated Mr. Cur-
rie. “However, nine-tenths of the
city was inundated. My church was
turned into an emergency hospital,
and it was not until Sunday before
last that we had been able to use

been made

ot

has pasto-

the Sunday School department since
the first of January, since sick ref-
ugees were still quartered in it.”

“When asked about the coming

centennial, Mr. Currie said he
thought it would be one of the
greatest events in the history of

the college. “You can rest assured
that I'm going to do my best to get
here to it,” he added.

Ever since he entered the ministry
Mr. Currie has been active in young
people’s work. “I haven't missed a
young people’s conference in the
last twelve years,” he commented;
“and at many conferences I have

taught classes or led the vesper
services.”
While a student at the college

Mr. Currie was a star pitcher on
the baseball team. After he grad-
uated he played professional base-
ball for two then returned
to the college and served one year
as “Y” secretary and one year as
baseball coach. Afterwards he went
to the Louisville Seminary for his
training for the ministry.

Spring Issue of Magazine
Appears in Bright Cover

Poll of Campus Opinion and
Beauty Contest Results
Are Reported

The long-awaited spring issue of
Scrips 'n Pranks, Davidson's well-
liked magazine, has at last shown
itself, and has been received quite
well by the student body. An attrac-
tive front cover by none other than
that talented artist, Sam Ryburn,
adorns the new edition and depicts
a young spring birdie in his bright
yellow suit sitting on a limb emit-
ing his shrill notes.

Upon turning the page we find a
tribute to spring and going further
we read a little

, This contained voting for the most

popular girls school, radio program,
comedian, orchestra, magazine and
many other interesting subjects. As
was expected, the Briarhopper Boys
completely annihilated all competi-
tion for the ‘Most unpopular radio

dents expressed their desire for the
quarter system instead of the pres-
ent semester system and they also
opposed President Roosevelt's pro-
posed judiciary change. Other re-
sults from this poll of 442 signed
questionnaires may be found in the
magazine.

Al Cade, the snoopy snooper sup-
er sleuth of “Sweeping the Cam-

ticle in the form of “The Wish of

but they received a lot of attention.

Editor Hal Overton and his boys
have done a great job on this last
issue and we are anxiously waiting
for the Centennial Issue, which is
to be published later on, and they
hope to make it a forty or fifty-
page edition. Overton says it should
be the best of all, and are looking
forward to it.

BRYANT ADDRESSES

Draws Morals From Lives of
Dwight L. Moody and
Gipsy-Smith
On last Sunday afternoon, March
21, Marion
“Y" cabinet in charge of boys’ work
went to the Charlotte Y. M. C. A.
to the combined
younger and older boys’ groups on
“The Life of Dwight L. Moody.”?
His audience was composed of boys
from six to eighteen years of age.

where he spoke

Using as his example the evan-
gelist whose 100th anniversary
being celebrated this year, Bryant
drew conclusions about
and fruitful living for his hearers.
Moody, as he pointed out, started
life as a business man,

is

mature
rather successful in a financial way,
but lacking direction in his work.
After he was converted he became
one of the greatest preachers Chris-
tianity has ever known.

Bryant pointed that that a man’s
Christianity, if just thought about
and not actually applied, does him
little good and serves to influence
no one for Christ. Intellec-
tual religion led to intellectual
skepticism, he said in effect.

else

Finally, comparing Moody to the
evangelist of today, Gipsy Smith,
who was then holding a series of
services in Charlotte, Bryant urged
his hearers to emulate those lead-
ers of Christianity and to convert
their convictions into strong Chris-
tian lives.

This group meets every week at
the “Y” to hold devotional services.
The work is supervised by men vi-
tally interested in boys’ work.

BRADLEY WIN

Will Enable Him to Continue
Chemistry at University
of Virginia

Harris Bradley,

the University Virginia. This
fellowship amounts to $600, and it
will enable him continue his
work in the field of chemistry, next
fall; senanetaoanbniseenerte

However, the fellowship is not
for work in chemistry, but for mus-
ical work. Bradley will act as an
assistant to the director of the band
at the University, and his study of
chemistry will be done on the side.
His band duties really allow more |
time for study than ordinary
assistantship in chemistry or some

other subject.

Bradley obtained this fellowship |
through a member of the Univer-
sity of Virginia faculty, Dr. Rob-
ert E. Lutz, professor of Chemis-
try, and-director of their band. An
application for an assistantship in
chemistry was first submitted, but
when Dr. Lutz of Brad-

Miriam Hopkins says:

“My throat welcomes Luckies—my favorite

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women-—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Hopkins verifies the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many, of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process

*Luckies have been my favorite cigarette
for about 5 years. They’re a light smoke
that sensitive throats welcome. Of the
many trends that sweep through Holly-
wood, one of the longest lasting has been
the preference for Luckies. I once asked
a ‘property’ man—who supplies ciga-
rettes to the actors—what the favorite is.
He answered by opening up a box con-
taining cigarettes. They were all Luckies.”
