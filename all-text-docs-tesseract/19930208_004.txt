Davidson Student Selected as
Posssible Bone Marrow Donor

By Alice Felmlee

Thanks to the miracles of
modem medicine and technology
many diseases are now curable.
While researchers and doctors hold
many keys to life, they cannot do it
allalone. Organ and bone marrow
donors too may give the gift of life.
If all goes well between now and
April, sophomore Megan Snyder
will be doing just that.

More than one year after hav-
ing her bone marrow typed at
Davidson’s Annual Bone Marrow
Drive, Snyder has been selected as
adonor. In order to reach this stage
of the process, she underwent two
additional blood tests, one last
spring and second in November.
The second test which involved
giving nine small tubes of blood
had to be performed twice because
of complications. The prospective
recipient of Snyder’s bone marrow
underwent the same test on the
same day. The doctors believe he
might have been ill on this day thus
causing complications,

Now that everything suggests
Snyder is a perfect match for the
recipient, she anticipates the day
on which she will donate her bone
marrow. How does she feel about
the whole procedure? “Of course

its alittle scary, but mainly its very
emotional-and exciting.” After
facing her own initial reservations
and dealing with her parents natu-
ral concem for possible healthrisks,
Snyder alone made the final deci-
sion.

The opcration which is sched-
uled for the weck of April first at
Wake Forest's Bowman Gray Hos-
pital involves a team of two doc-
tors using syringes to extract bone
marrow from her pelvic bone. The
only realrisk comes with the use of
anesthesia— and Snyder wasquick |
to point out that this is now acom-
mon practice. “Everyone gets an-
esthesia when having their wis-
dom teeth out so that doesn’treally
bother me.” Pain for the donor is
also limited to “slight discomfort.”

Although Snyder, a member
of the field hockey team, is the
bone marrow donor she knows litule
about the recipient and he knows
little about her. “AIL I know is that
he is a forty-four year old man with
chronic leukemia. I don’t even
know where he lives.” Amidst all
of this secrecy one. thing; however,
is for sure. Within twelve hours of
Snyder’s surgery a forty-four year
old man will be entering another
operating room in a fight for his

life.

Not for another year will
Snyderbe given the chance to meet
therecipient, and thatdepends upon
his willingness to do so. Until then
she plans to check on his progress
by corresponding through a third
party. es 4

Although Snyder’s perspec-
tive on dife*hasn’t changed since
becoming a donor she has become
more aware. “It’s hard for me to
imagine what he is going through
as I live my daily life.” Although
there is only a 50-50 chance for the
operation’s success, the whole
thing is very inspiring.”

This story should prove to be
inspiring for the Davidson College
family as well. Since bone marrow
testing began in 1987 there have
been only 2000 matches of unre-
lated people. Make that 2001.
Thanks to Davidson that number
includes Megan Snyder and she
admitted, “‘a lot of credit goes to
the people who organized the Bone
Marrow Drive —they madc iteasy
for this to be possible.” And fi-
nally she said, “I encourage every-
one to sign up for the bone marrow
drive next year.”

Norwood Flies Relief to U.S.
Troops Stationed in Somalia

By Shaye Benton

Turmoil of Somalia: it perme-
ates the media, filters into class
discussions, and proves itself in
pictures of starving children. Yet
what’s happening half-way across
the world still scems so distant...

Tom Norwood, Davidson As-
sistant Director of Corporate and
Foundation Relations, expericnced
Somalia first-hand when he flew
30 tons of food and equipment to
the Mogadishu Somalian Airport
on a 15 1/2 hour non-stop flight
during Christmas break.

The “Pony Express” system
in which Norwood participated
involved the transport of badly
necded cargo to U.S. troops from
Amcrican Air Bases in California
and Saudi Arabia. The American
troops, sheltered in airplane hang-
ers with little water, food, and utili-
lics, greatly appreciated the sup-
plies and even took advantage of
the plane’s bathrooms and air con-
ditioning.

A major in the U.S. Air Force
Reserve, Norwood has been flying
for over 20 years and spends 2-3
weekends per month staying cur-
rent with the proficiency require-
ments for pilots. By staying cur-
rent Norwood explained that Re-
serve pilots can “step right in and
go” whenever and wherever they
are needed.

Norwood, a KC-10 Aircraft
Commander, was needed Decem-
ber 28 - January 5 when he flew
from the Scymour-Johnson base to
the West Coast for assignment toa
cargo plane. He then flew a KC-
10, an aircraft used as a tanker in
the Persian Gulf War, following a

course from California to Massa-
chusetts, on to Spain, over the
Mediterranean, between Italy and
Sicily, through the south of Greece
to Egypt, and finally to Saudi
Arabia where the crew had a short
layover before arriving at
Mogadishu. Since the flight was
non-stop the plane had to be refu-
eled twice while in mid-air.
Norwood explained that in order
to refuel while in flight the plane
must decrease its speed to meet the
fueling craft at a certain location.
The two planes then fly surpris-
ingly close, one behind the other,
until the refueling is completed.

Once having arrived the relicf
crew delivered the 30-ton cargo. It
consisting of necessary food and
equipment but also of beloved
Doritoes, pizza, Cokes, and other
junk food and was given directly to
the troops instead of torclief agen-
cies.

While in Somalia,Norwood
decided to stay at the airport in-
stead of exploring the area because
of reported shooting in the streets
the day before. The return trip
took only 14 1/2 hours because of

a tail wind to the plane’s advan-

tage.
One of the biggest challenges,
Norwood said, was to stay ori-
ented amidst the enormous time
changes. Passing through two
“days” and two “nights” in 15 1/2
hours could become somewhat
confusing, especially while con-
centrating so intensely for twice
the hours ina normal working day.
‘As for the condition of the
area Norwood remarked that it
made “Saudi Arabia look like a

Hilton.” The day before Norwood
arrived, President Bush had flown

into Somalia and visited the troops -

to meet and talk with them.

Norwood said the “morale of the .

troops was pretty upbeat; they were

‘up because they knew the world
was paying some attention to
them.”

As Norwood commented, itis
assuring to know that the U.S. has
the capability to sustain operations
like this one thousands of miles
away in Somalia. “‘An experience
like this,” he said, “makes you

’ grateful for life in America,”

betan religion, politics, and other aspects of their unique Himalayan
culture. They will also perform the “vocal and instrumental music,” that,
according to Stasack “they incorporate in ritual practice as a means of
effecting spiritual alignment and transcendence.” The monks’ visit is
possible due to the support of the Dean Rusk Program and the Music
Department.

‘The Tibetan monks are in townas part of the celebration of Tibetan
Cultural Awareness Month in Charlotte. In proclaiming February as
Tibetan Cultural Awareness Month, Mayor Vinroot cited the awarding
of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize to His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama
and the fact that 1992 was the International Year Of Tibet.

All of this recognition stems from the thirty-three ycars that Tibet
has been occupied and ruled by Communist China. Since 1959, the
Tibetan government and many of its citizens have becn in exile through-
out the world, mostly in India and Nepal. Although the occupation is
horrible, comparable to the Holocaust in its genocidal efforts, it has
brought the rich, unique, and very mysterious culture of Tibet to the
outside world. Do not miss this opportunity to learn about one of the
most beautiful and peaceful societies in the cosmos.
