OUR DEBATERS,

Day after tomorrow night Davidson
and Roanoke will clash in a forensic bat-
tle in Shestrer Hall, probably the first
intercollegiate debate that has ever been
held on the Hill, or at least for a num-
ber of years. Our representatives, Cou-
sar and Bellingrath, will prove to the
Roanoke delegation that the government
should own and operate all interestate
railroads, and we feel confident that
these two veteran speakers will leave the
platform with the palms securely tucked
under their arms.

Davidson men will turn out in force
and with all kinds of pep for a football
or baseball game. Debating is just as
much a college activity, tho not of the
same kind, and deserves the hearty sup-
port of the whole student. body. Our
debaters work as hard as any other team
on the Hill. ‘There has been hardly a
night for the last two months when the
lights haven’t been burning till late in
the magazine room of the library, and
countless hours have been spent in prep-
aration of main debates, and in study of
the opposing side, to find all possible
points to be torn down. These men are
working for Davidson; for its prestige
and reputation. Roanoke won from us
last. vear, and Friday night is when we
get our revenge. ‘Three weeks ago our
other team defeated by a four to one
vote LaFayette College, who the night
previous had won unanimously from
George Washington University. Go up
Friday night and hear Cousar and Bel-
lingrath repeat the performance.  Re-
member, the fewer empty benches the
better will be the debate. Let's resurrect
that old Davidson pep and turn out en
masse to cheer our debaters to victory.

THE LAST LAP.

Only a month and the spring exams
will be on us—and it will be a month
that would try the patience of Job—
should he try to stay indoors and study.
The campus is becoming beautiful and
the weather fine. Spring fever is abroad
and loafing is without doubt the most
attractive “activity” on the Hill. And
it is the irony of fate that during this
very month we should do our best work.

That final sprint of the race decides the
outcome, tho it comes at the time when
the runner is worn out and almost ready
to give up. Four weeks of hard work
will carry many a man over that danger-
ous dividing line and give him that
coveted pass. Look ahead and sce if

you wouldn’t much rather work just a

little harder this spring and put a year’s
course behind you, rather than have to
go over it all again next year, or, in the
cast of the seniors, lose your “dip.” It’s
time for that final spurt to begin now,
and let’s put a “punch” in this last month
that will carry everyone over the mark.

SINGING.

Please don’t shy at this heading, as
this article is not an exhortation to sing
in chapel, tho such a phenomenon would
no doubt follow the application of the
following suggestion:

Four years ago a renowned quartet
every fine spring night would sit on a
bench under the trees and furnish the
campus with all manner of agony. Even
now a crowd here and there ventures to
raise its voice in song. But there’s not
enough of that kind of singing on the
campus. Some would say that study
would be seriouly interfered with by any
such after-supper singing. But, frankly,
when, you sit in your room on a hot

Tspring night, out of humor and blue, and

the sound of a song, with tenor, base,
and air, in harmony, comes — floating
across the lawn, does it have the tend-
ency to disturb you? Rather doesn’t it
give you a kind of pleasing and satisfy-
ing sensation? “This may sound poetic
and seem to have the tendency toward—
(the bovine expression commonly used
by college students), and such a state-
ment made thotlessly is open to ridicule;
vet stop and think for a moment serious-
ly, without prejudice and with an open
mind. We believe that such group sing-
ing will do two things: promote a close
spirit of fellowship among the boys sing-
ing together, and increase and foster
general college spirit or pep, Philosoph-
ers have said that singing is one of the
strongest factors in the world toward
bindin and knitting hearts in friendship:
and the fact that the authorities have
put singing on the schedules of regular
daily duties in every training camp goes
to prove its power to, keep up morale,
good humor; contentedness and spirit.
Many a fellow’s life on the campus
would be made happier by © singing.
Think over it and see if the absence of
singing at Davidson is not entirely a
matter of habit. It cannot be gotten by
compulsion or organization, but only by
a change of attitude on the part of each
individual man. Very few students are
unable to carry a tune, and if only this
thing could be made a habit, we cannot
estimate the value it would be to our
college. “Think about it.

TILE QUADRANGLE.

The center of beauty on the Hill
promises soon to be what Mr. Nolen, in
his plan of the campus, named the quad-
rangle—the space between Chambers
building and the gymnasium, His sur-
vey provides also for four buildings,
two on each side, facing the quadrangle;
but of course these are out of the ques-
tion till well after the war. However,
this spring many improvements are un-
der way. The- Seniors, as their class
gift. are financing the terracing of the
ground about two-thirds of the way from
Chambers to the gym, the construction
of a broad flight of concrete steps lead-
ing down this terrace, and the erection
of two handsome light standards, which
will illuminate the walk from one build-
ing to the other. The undergrowth will
be cleared out from the woods, leaving
only the larger trees standing, the old
coal shack will be demolished, and sod
will be laid from Chambers to the gym-
nasium, When all this is done and the
outside of Chambers is put under the

care of carpenters and painters for a day
or so, this part of the campus promises
in truth to be the prettiest spot on the
college grounds.

DR. WHALING PREACHES
AT PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

Dr. Thornton Whaling, president of
Columbia Theological Seminary, filled
Dr. Richards’ pulpit at both services on

April 7. The subject of the morning
sermon was, “The Highest Steward-
ship.” His text was: “But first gave

their own selves.” II Cor. 8:5. At the
evening service, Dr. Whaling took for
his text: ‘‘He was angry and would not
goin.” Luke 15:28. He gave a picture
of the father, the younger and the elder
son, as representing God the Father, the
bold and open sinner and the Pharasaic
sinner. At a joint meeting of the Col-
lege Christian Endeavor, the Ministerial
Band and the Volunteer Band at 7 p.
m., Dr. Whaling presented “The Claims
of the Ministry in the ‘'wentieth Cen-
tury on University and College. Men.”

GERMAN GOV’M’T, TOPIC
OF BOOK LOVERS’ CLUB

The Book Lovers’ Club met last Fri-
day afternoon with Mrs. W. W. Wood.
Mrs. J. L. Currie had charge of the
program, the subject of which was the
effect of the present war on the German
Government. “Two very interesting pa-
pers were read by Mrs. Grey and Miss
Ellinwood. ‘The program committee
suggested as the outline for next year
the study of “France.” which was im-
mediately adopted. Mrs. Woolsey, of
New York, was the guest of the after-
noon. Later a delicious salad course was
served,
