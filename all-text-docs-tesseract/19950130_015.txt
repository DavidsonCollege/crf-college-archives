Swimming continues success with win over Ga. Tech >

By Mike Guggenheimer

In his second year as head
coach of Davidson’s swimming
and diving teams, Rich DeSelm
has been very pleased with what
he’s seen.

“This year has been more dif-
ficult for me,” DeSelm says. His
first year was tough, but he held
back some to get a feel for the
team. “I’m tightening the screws
again this year,” he says,

And his swimmers have re-
sponded very well. In addition to
both the men’s and women’s teams
boasting Academic All-American
accolades with team GPAs over
3.0, they are doing well in the pool.

“No one thinks Davidson will
do well, but we have high expecta-

tions,” DeSelm says. They repeat-
edly surprise bigger and more es-
tablished programs with their per-
formances,

That was the case Sunday as
the men faced Georgia Tech in a
meet at home.

Last year, the Yellow Jackets
took the meet by winning the final
relay by 33 hundredths of a sec-
ond, This year, the Wildcats won
the meet’s opening relay and did
not look back, going on to demol-
ish their opponent.

“You can tell that the training
is paying off and the focus is there,”
DeSelm said.

Freddy Schnell, Matt Buck,
Corey Bean, and Timothy Lim
combined on that first relay - the

200 medley relay - to set a record
and set the tone for the event:

Reflecting on the season as a
whole, DeSelm cites Parents’
Weekend at one of the highlights,
when the teams combined for three
victories over two days.

The only loss that weekend
was a three-point loss by the
women to a good College of
Charleston squad. He said that
after that weekend, the team real-
ized that they could be successful
and gained enthusiasm.

Another important time for
the team was the Florida training
trip over Christmas break.

“We went down there for 10
days and trained hard,” says
DeSelm. “The team really began

to pull together.”

For the second year in a row,
the team has a great group of fresh-
men. The men are led by Buck,
who has a chance to qualify for the
NCAAs, and veteran leader, junior
Churchill Hooff.

“Churchill is swimming very,
very well right now,” DeSelm says.
Co-captain Bean: and freshman
Schnell have also been important
contributors for the Wildcats.

The women are led by sopho-
more Susanne Herring and three
freshmen: Heather Sweeny, Kelly
Bolterstein, and Allison Beebe.
Michael Hart, Jonathan Frost, and
Meg Bentley have been the top
performers so far for the divers.

While they usually aim to peak

at the end of the season, DeSelm
says that many of the swimmers

are already recording personal

bests. The team works hard and a
few of the swimmers seem to be
improving “every time they step
into the pool,” says DeSelm.

The Wildcats next face Duke
and Richmond Saturday in a meet
at Duke.

DeSelm has high hopes for
the conclusion of the season at the
Southern States meet in three
weeks.

He is very proud of his team
and what it has accomplished; and
with such a young and determined
team, the future certainly looks
bright.

16. Narcisse Ewodo came off the
bench to contribute 14 points, in-
cluding a couple high-flying
dunks, crowd-pleasing blocks and
all-around great hustle. Also giv-
ing big performances off the bench
were Ray Minlend and Billy
Armstrong, who both filled the
point guard spot when starter Chris
Alpert was saddled on the bench
with four fouls for more than 11
minutes of the second half.

“J couldn’t have been more
pleased with Ray and Billy,” coach
Bob McKillop said. “The bench
stepped up and gave us a great lift
tonight.”

Now the Wildcats are-sitting» «

in good position in the conference
with a two-game lead on the Herd
and already having beaten ETSU
on the road. Davidson travels to
Georgia Southern tonight before
coming home Saturday to face
Western Carolina, which before
Saturday’s loss to The Citadel was
the only undefeated in the league.

“It hasn’t mattered to us what
everyone else is doing,” Williams
said. “‘What decides where we’ re
going is us.”

Davidson started the game
strong, scoring the first four points
and jumping out to leads of 11-3
and 18-8, capped by a three-pointer
by Alpert at the 10:46 mark and
fueled by a dunk from Williams.

The Wildcats were beating
Marshall at its own game, running
the fast-break well, handling the
Herd’s pressure defense and get-
ting hands on many passes on de-
fense. That continued for most of
the first half, as every time
Marshall would creep closer, the
Wildcats would respond with a
mini-run to increase the margin
again to the halftime score of 43-
30.

“We are a team that’s com-
fortable playing both an up-tempo
game and the half-court game,”
McKillop said. “‘We can be very
effective at both, which is part of
our success.”

After a Spain putback to start
the second half, Marshall appeared
to rattle Davidson a little bit and

went on an 18-4 run to close to 49-
48. Tink Brown (11 points) had
two three-pointers in the run, and
Shawn Moore (22 points) added a
three-pointer and a dunk.

But the Wildcats responded
impressively, going on a 22-7 run
to up the lead to 16 points, basi-
cally ending the game. The spurt
was started by the clutch play of
Minlend, who converted a pass
from Quinn Harwood perfectly and
then turned around and forced a
Marshall turnover.

“Ray sparked all of that,”
Minlend said. “All of a sudden
that one-point lead is five points.”

Ewodo had all nine of his
second-half points in the run, in-
cluding a show-stopping, author-
ity baseline slam, drawing a foul
from Malik Hightower.

“We’re working on develop-
ing akillerinstinct,” Williams said.
“We were alittle complacent with
that little cushion we had... .
We’ re working on putting people
away.”
