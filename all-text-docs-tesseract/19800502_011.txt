Dittman said his leaving
would’ “‘undeniably cause an
interruption in the momentum”
of the 1987 Program, adding,
‘but there are enough people
working on it that I hope
Davidson will not be hurt.’

“Tt’s been an agonizing deci-
sion to leave ‘since I' love
Davidson and have invested a
piece of my life in it,” Dittman
said, ‘‘but the offer and the
opportunity (at William and
Mary) were just too good to
resist.”

Because the administration
decided to make Cartmill a
physical education professor
after he stepped down as Ath-
letic Director effective in Au-
gust, he and Martin worked out
a reshuffling of their responsi-
bilities.

Cartmill will help develop the
new sports complex and direct
the movement of the riding
program to the lake campus.

Essential to the dias tenets
of the Trustees is a strong
Christian commitment. The
Trustee by-laws ask each Trus-
tee whether he approves of the
purpose of Davidson College as
outlined by the College Consti-
tutuion: ‘‘The primary loyalty
of the College extends beyond
the bounds of denomination to
the Christian community as a
whole, through which medium
it would seek to serve the
world.’’ The Trustees are also

asked to increase the effective- .

ness of Davidson as an “institu-
tion of Christian learning.”

aspect of college life that Eglin
said is i improving due to meas-
ures taken by the College is

overcrowding, Eglin said it is

important to encourage more
people to “‘get out and exper-
ience aspects of Davidson other
than academics.”

we're both* native Charlot-
teans.’

Although he was ‘‘not even
looking for a new job,’’ Lee
added, the Queens offer was

“too good an opportunity to
pass up.’

At Queens Lee will replace
Davidson alumnus Joe Martin
who unexpectedly resigned to
work at North Carolina Nation-
al’ Bank.

Covington, who has worked
at Davidson since December
1978, said he always knew he
would eventually go to semin-
ary ‘somewhere down the line.”

Dittman said his biggest
satisfaction from working at
Davidson came from getting the
1987 Program ‘‘on track.’’ ‘To
be able to count almost 14%
million dollars in commitments
and gifts in 3 years, and to pull
together and trdin a staff has
been a personal satisfaction for
me.”

“Every job has frustrations,”
Dittman added, ‘‘but my
Davidson experience was a hap-
py one.’

If he could change pitiathing
about Davidson, Dittman said,

he would perhaps enlarge the .

administrative staff. ‘Davidson
is understaffed administrative-
ly —the staffing is incredibly
thin in comparison to our
ambitions,” he said, pointing
out the Deans’ offices as parti-
cularly overworked.

His major concern,’ however,
Dittman said, is for the David-
son community. “It grieves me
when people are unkind to each
other in this community,’ he
said, ‘‘creating factions of the
Trustees, faculty, administra-
tion, and students. At a time
when higher education is sus-

pect in the outside world such’

factions ought to pull togeth-

er.

Trustees

tutions in this decade will put
demands. upon small private
colleges like Davidson. How-
ever, the Trustees are commit-
ted to maintaining Davidson as
a ‘“‘small community of learn-
ers.”’ The Trustees have also
elected to ‘‘emphasize the teach-
ing responsibility of all profes-
sors, and to ensure the oppor-
tunity for personal relationships
between students and teach-

rs."’ Cunningham noted that
the Trustees are generally
Davidson graduates or are peo-
ple with an ‘educational inter-
est.”

The Trustees are also com-
mitted to maintaining David-
son’s status as a college of
liberal arts. They have the
responsibility of “building an
institution which, with increas-

who will remain here next year
is to “‘balance academics with
other activities,’ not limiting
yourself to ‘‘one phase’’ of the
experiences Davidson has to
offer.

Plans for next year are for
Eglin somewhat uncertain. She
said she plans to return home to
Atlanta in June to ‘sponge off”
her parents for a while and then
take the time to find an enjoy-
able career.

ing effectiveness, can serve
students today and tomorrow,”
according to the Danforth Com-
mission report: It is the task of
Davidson Trustees to create a
liberal arts institution which
fulfills this role. The College
should seek to “teach students
to think clearly and accurately,
to make relevant and valid
judgments, to discriminate a-
mong values, and to communi-
cate freely with others in the
realm of ideas.”’

Until ten years ago, the
average Trustee did not have a
large role in decisionmaking,
according to Spencer. The Exe-
cutive Committee used to meet
in advance and present their
recommendations to the general
Trustee body, Spencer said.
“The whole Board would then
rubberstamp (the decision) the
next day,”’ Spencer said.

The Trustees then adopted a
policy whereby a group of
committees would report ‘‘di-
rectly to the whole board,
Spencer said. ‘‘Some of the

current committees are the Ex-
ecutive Committee, Athletics
and Physical tion, Build-
ing and Grounds, Development
and Alumni , Education,

Finance and Management, Re-..

ligious Policy and Program,

Davidson’s athletic program are

ahtletic: directors came to Da-
vidson in April to evaluate
College athletic policy.) ‘‘We
can’t say much about what
(physical education) is
going to do until we know what
the other 95% (of the athletics
department) is going to do,”
Physics Professor Lawrence
Cain said.

However, Maydole said, ‘‘We
ought to be defining parameters
—not waiting (for someone else
to do it).””

“We haven’t been asked to
advise on anything,’’ Maydole
added. ‘‘I seem to be the only
one on the committee who
thought there was something to
do.”

Zimmermann said it was
“natural”’ for the Council to be
inactive for long periods of
time. He likened the Council to

bringing their charges on cam-

- pus and into dorms.

MacCormac said the town is
“on the verge”’ of choosing what
facilities it wants and can pay
for. James Raeford, who has
just finished serving on the
Park and Recreation Commit-
tee, said in reference to a
proposed park, ‘‘We need more
facilities, but where are you
going ‘to put it?’’ He said the
basic problem comes back to
land, to trying to find a
centrally located place for facili-
ties that can be developed
permanently.

Role in Town Govt.

Along with Davidson Col-
lege’s important role in land
development, housing, employ-
ment, and recreation, it has
been prominent in town govern-
ment.

MacCormac said that though
the town tries to balance the
various communities in the
area, it values the cooperation
and relationship with the Col-
lege.’’ She said the area as a
whole tends to balance the town
board on its own. Traditionally;
the College has had two repre-
sentatives on the Board, but
now it has only one—Econom-
ics Professor Randy Kincaid.

However, Salinda Mayhew,
Annie Mildred Lowry, and oth-
ers all echoed Daisy Raeford,
who said, ‘‘I still say that
whatever they want they go
ahead and get it;’’ though
she said communication has
improved between the: College
and the black community. Low-
ry attributes apathy in the

black community to too much.

affairs.
“Too many college professors

and their wives are, taking. the ;

town over.... They come and do
it their way. without under-

standing what's gone before.
On all the committees, it’s

James Raeford acknowledged”
the College’s power, but he
didn’t think it was unusual.
“look at it like this: in any

powerful, because it means a lot
to the town and to the commu-
nity.”

Though the black community
has some representation and.
organization, the Delburg
Street area has been ‘‘more
placid,’ according to Mayhew.
She said they have no power

_and “just aren’t motivated to

take part.” She felt there is.
little or no communication
between the College and Del-
burg Street residents. ‘‘We’re
on the wrong side of the tracks
for the College, I. think that’s
the way people feel.”
Traditionally, the College has
been active in providing ser-

. vices to the whole community.

Mayhew recalled the years
when Davidson College pro-
vided food and madecine to
needy families in the Mill
Village. Now ‘“‘you have Medi-
care, Medicaid, government
programs, there’s not the need
for college support.

In fact, the College has in
recent years been withdrawing
from the town and its previous
dominant role. One example is.
the separation of the campus
security force that occured three
years ago. The College and the
town are both more satisfied
now according to Cook, Mac-
Cormac, and Lowry.
