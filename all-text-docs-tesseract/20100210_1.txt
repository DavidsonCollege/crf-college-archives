Special Report: SGA election miscues bring reform

Brian Park
Managing Editor

Last week, students voted for a
new administration of the Student
Government Association. Amid the
celebrations for the newly elected
officers was a controversy that
exposed the short-comings of the
SGA bylaws. Two candidates in the
race were disqualified, much to the
ignorance of the student body. Of
these two candidates, one has gone
public with his situation, Faheem
Rathore ’12. His specific case has
demonstrated the flaws of SGA’s
constitution.

Rathore was running for the
position of SGA vice-president.
Prior to an all-candidates meeting,
he contacted the presidents of two
eating houses to ask for permis-
sion to speak at those houses. Later
in the day, Rathore attended the
mandatory all-candidates meeting,
and learned that any campaigning
prior to that meeting is forbidden.
Rathore informed the Elections
Council, composed of Billy Hack-
enson °13, John Merrill °13, and
current SGA President Meikaela
Zwieryznski °09, of his actions.
He also contacted the presidents of
the eating houses to inform them to
disregard his previous email. Upon
notifying the Elections Council of
his offence, the Chairperson ruled,
without consulting the other Coun-
cil members, that Rathore’s pun-
ishment would be a 24 hour proba-
tion from campaigning, effectively

giving him a day less to campaign.
Rathore agreed to the ruling, and
waited until the next day to resume
campaigning.

On February 1, the first round
of voting for the vice-presidency
of SGA occurred. Rathore cam-
paigned vigorously and built a
strong following. The polls closed
at 10:00 p.m., but after 11:00 p.m.
Rathore received an email inform-
ing him that he could potentially
be disqualified. The SGA bylaws
clearly state, “Violation of any
campaign regulation results in
disqualification,” and Rathore’s
email to the presidents of two eat-

ing houses was being considered
as campaigning. After 12:50 a.m.,
Rathore received an email inform-
ing him of his disqualification.
This incident has exposed many
faults in the current SGA bylaws.
The first problem is the definition of
campaigning. What constitutes as
“campaigning?” Rathore emailed
the eating house presidents for per-
mission to speak with them later,
but he did not explicitly promote
his candidacy. The rules of SGA do
not explicitly answer what is to be
considered campaigning, making
the very nature of Rathore’s of-

fence subjective.

Another controversy is why
Rathore was punished twice. He
was first given the 24 hour proba-
tion, and then later disqualified.
“I would rather have just been
disqualified,” Rathore said of his
two punishments. SGA President
Meikaela Zwieryznski explained,
“The probation was not allowed in
the SGA bylaws,” thus making the
probation nothing more than an ar-
bitrary and unofficial punishment.

adviser to the SGA further elabo-

Harmon ’10 deliberates ethics of Wal-Mart

KELLY WiLSON
Staff Writer

Last Thursday, an Ethics Fo-
rum sponsored by Davidson’s Vann
Center for Ethics hosted Marjie
Harmon ’10, who presented a con-
densed version of her senior the-
sis entitled “Sam Walton’s Gospel
Meets the Christian Gospel: Theo-
logical Analysis of Wal-Mart’s Re-
muneration Practices.”

The paper is this year’s winner
of the Religion Department’s pres-
tigious Maloney Prize. Harmon
also presented her research at the
North Carolina Religious Studies
Association, and they will publish
it this year.

““Wal-Mart has become a light-
ening rod of societal conflict and
debate, with poll results indicat-
ing that the American people have
deeply divided attitudes toward this
multi-national retailer,” Harmon
said. “Yet responsible citizens, and
in particular, responsible Christians
cannot simply resign themselves
to an ambivalent attitude given the
unfathomable magnitude and influ-

ence this corporate giant has.”

Not only is Wal-Mart the
world’s largest corporation, but it
is also the largest private employer.
Harmon cited one statistic which
noted that one third of Americans
shop at Wal-Mart each week, and
in 2003, 82 percent of households
purchased merchandise from this
retailer.

“To some degree, the economic
health of the entire economy hing-
es upon the success of its largest
retailer,” Harmon said. “Its sales
volumes for a single day last fall
came in ahead of the GDPs of 36
countries.

“A Christian-based analysis of
this company requires a theological
examination of the way in which
Wal-Mart’s conduct affects the
well-being of God’s creation and
God’s creatures,” she continued.
“The level at which Wal-Mart com-
pensates its workforce influences
its other business practices.”

Citing several theologians
including John A. Ryan, Walter
Rauschenbusch, Judith Brady and
Christine Hinze, Harmon pointed

out that in general these thinkers
“insisted that every laborer has the
right to at least a decent livelihood.
For Rauschenbusch, fair wages
constituted a manifestation of jus-
tice on the personal level. Unjust
pay practices ‘break down workers’
nerves, their mental buoyancy and
their character. A truly just remu-
neration practice requires a wage
that allows workers to live a healthy
existence. Modern-day theologians
have more explicitly defined a liv-
ing wage as the salary that ensures
adequate healthcare coverage for
the laborer.”

Brady and Hinze argued that
“any wage that fails to secure ad-
equate healthcare coverage for the
laborer falls short of the Christian
justice standard.”

Despite these philosophies that
focus on the necessity for a fair
wage earned by individuals, Har-
mon illustrated that a fair analysis
of Wal-Mart’s payment policies
must also include a consideration
of the overall social benefit the
company provides to society.

“Wal-Mart delivers substantial

overall social benefits in the form
of lower prices,” she said. “The
Bureau of Economic Research now
credits Wal-Mart with driving down
the inflation rate by upwards of 15
percent, meaning that all Ameri-
cans substantially profit from its
low pricing commitment.”

In particular, the main benefi-
ciaries of Wal-Mart’s low prices are
the poor, without whom Wal-Mart
would not be able to afford many of
the products it stocks. Wal-Mart’s
growth has caused an increase in
the standard of living for many
people.

This is the basis of Harmon’s
central question. “Wal-Mart marks
up its products by mere pennies
and passes those savings along to
the consumer in the form of lower
prices,” Harmon explained. “Given
the social good Wal-Mart achieves
on behalf of the poor, and it’s re-
distribution of gains in the form of
lower prices, the question remains,
‘How do Christian based ethics
sort through this myriad of compet-
