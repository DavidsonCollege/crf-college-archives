6—The Davidsonian— May 1, 1981

Inside IMAC

The regular season is coming to a close this week with final.
games on Wednesday and Thursday. Tournament play will
begin next week.

As I said last week, Eddie Searchers is the only softball team
still undefeated. They posted a close victory over the Hosebag
Hunters Tuesday (7-6). The Hosebag Hunters hit well, but their
defense allowed 4 undeserved runs past them in bottom of the
fourth. - Going into the bottom of the seventh with a 6-4 lead and

with 2 outs on, Eddie Searchers
took advantage of an infield
error to score the game’s win-
ning run.

Although they are undefeat-
ed, Eddie Searchers is not my
pick to win the tournament. My
hunch is the winner will be
Bone. First of all, Bone has by

George
Murrell

far the best athletes and the longest ball hitters of any of the
teams. This could come into play if some of their critical
tournament games are scheduled on short fields two or three.
Rip Singer, Joe Palasak, Gifford Piercy and others have no
problem hitting into the woods on these fields.

Eddie Searchers plays consistently and obviously could win
the tournament — but some of the other teams have more talent.

There are four sleeper teams capable of winning the
championship: Perpetual Perpetrators, Phi Delt, Hosebag
Hunters, and Skoal Brothers. The Perpetual Perpetrators really
shouldn’t be called a sleeper team. They’ve played well all
season. If they have a good day, they could upset Bone. Phi
Delt has played well in recent games and should be primed for
the tournament, especially if they can field their better players.
I don’t know much about Skoal Brothers, but they have beaten
some good teams, earlier in the season. Finally, I have to give
the Hosebag Hunters a sleeper’s chance of winning. They played
well against Eddie Searchers, and IJ think if they play better
defense they could go all the way.

Volleyball was dormant this past week so there are no scores
to report. Here is the final Regular Season Top Ten:
1) & 2) Bone, Eddie Searchers
3) Perpetual Perpetrators
4)Phi Delt
5) Skoal thers
6) Hosebee Hunters
7) Weakling #1

Wildcats win doubleheader over ASU

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

The Wildcat baseball team
had a disappointing 2-3 week
but was able to finish on a high’
note with a surprising double-
header sweep over Appalachian
State.

The two wins gave the
Wildcats a final Southern Con-
ference record of 7-9, which will
probably leave them in sixth
place in the conference.

The week’s command perfor-
mance was Monday, high in the
mountains of Boone, when the
Wildcats took on a 31-32 ASU
team that was vying for South-
ern Conference laurels. The
lowlanders knocked the Apps
out of the race with 10-5, 3-0
sweep.

A thirteen-hit Davidson
attack gave the Wildcats an.
early 10-2 lead in the first game.
The Apps came back with three
runs in the sixth, but the Cats
soon stemmed the rally. Senior
Joby Merten led the offense as
he lashed out. a triple and
bunted in a suicide squeeze play
of the sixth and winning run.

In the second game, junior
Rusty Colechia pitched master-
fully, only issuing one walk in
his 3-0 shutout effort. Colechia
had eight hits behind him to
keep the lead padded.

Hitting in the twin-bill was
extraordinary. Junior Allen
Griffin pounded out seven hits
that included a triple and his
first homer of the season. His
performance pulled his batting

Southern Conferénce track meet
held at Davidson last weekend.
VMI finished the meet with 161
points, outscoring second place.
team Appalachian State Uni-
versity by 55 points. Davidson
managed to score nine points to
secure an eighth-place finish
just ahead of last place team
University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga which scored only
one point. This year’s Davidson
finish was an improvement over
the three point last place finish
in 1980, yet it was still far below
the team’s expectations.

Senior Captain Dick Jones
finished fourth in the 400 meter
intermediate hurdles. Jones
won the qualifying heat on
Friday afternoon, but his time
in the finals on Saturday did not
match his best time for the
year. Junior Lance Sisco man-
aged to place sixth in the -110

‘meter high hurdles in his first

competition since a hamstring
pull earlier this season. Coach
Steve Frank said he feels con-
fident that when Sisco is in top
condition he will be one of the
very best hurdlers in the South-
ern Conference.

Senior John Davis finished
his Davidson track cateer with a
sixth place finish and’a personal
record of 9:40.2 in the 3000
meter steeple chabe
pected finish, sophomore Stan
Klinger placed fifth in the
javelin with a 185 foot throw.

_ Despite the anticlimactic fin-

. In an unex-

average to .406. If he keeps
that mark up he will become
only the second Wildcat to bat
.400. The record-holder is Greg
Weicker, who batted .448 in
1975. Senior Eddie Haskell
went 3-for-6 with two doubles
as his doubles count went to 15,
a Davidson record. Earl Ran-
som also hit well. going
4-for-7 with a triple.

The week began in a rather
lackluster fashion however.
First Winthrop, ranked eighth
in the National Association of
Collegiate Athletics (NAIA),
shelled the Cats 13-3. Then on
Friday. the team hosted Camp-

meet, the track team finished
with a 3-1 dual meet record,
their best in recent years.
Davidson also placed second
out of five teams in the ASU
Invitational Track Meet and
third out of eight teams in the
Appalachian Track Classics.
Next year, it will be hard to
cover for the loss of seniors Dick

Saturday. the team held a 4-0
lead over Methodist, but two
costly errors allowed Methodist
to come back and win, 9-4.

It has been the same story
all season—deficient pitching
and defense. The only two
steady pitchers have been fresh-
man Scott Redding (4-3), and
Colechia (5-6).

The team’s overall record now
stands as 16-25. Tonight the

second in the ACC. Tuesday,

last game of the season.

Klinger, Clark Carter, and John
Hoots (who will be returning
from JYA in Germany), should
help to carry the load, he added.

Frank’s gaol is to continue to ©

improve the team’s standing in
the SouthernConference. New

freshmen-will hopefully help to
round out the team of returning
tracksters, he said. Frank noted
that Davidson’s non-scholar-
ship track team always faces a
tough challenge in competing
against teams that award track
scholarships, but that Davidson
is able to attract enough quality
athletes to be a tough competi-
tor in the Southern Conference.

Point in state championship

By KATIE DAGENHART
Staff Writer

The women’s tennis team
squeaked by defending state
champion High Point College
54-52 in the North Carolina
Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women
(NCAIAW) state tournament
last week. .

Coach Pat Miller said the
team was surprised and very
happy about the title.

Junior Emmy Knobloch cap-

‘tured the championship for the

number one singles position.
Senior Hope McArn was the
champion in the number two

position, and sophomore
Catherine Smith won in the
fourth singles spot. Smith and
Junior Adleaide Wilcox were
the best third doubles team in
the state, while Knobloch: and
McArn were runners-up in com-
petition among doubles teams
in the number one spot.

The top five teams were
Davidson, High Point College,

Guilford College, UNCC, and

East Carolina University.

The Cats will now advance to
the Regionals to be held May
14-16 in Charlotte. Miller said
that she hopes a lot of students
will be able to come and support
the team.
