Some thoughts on baseball,
political correctness, and insensi-
tivity:

The World Series is over by
now, but I want everyone to take
away something else from it other
than knowing that if you properly
parlay your corporate wealth into
your baseball team you can win a
World Series, or that Gregg
Maddux would have been the
Greek god of pitching.

After the millionaires went on
strike, I decided to stay away from
baseball until 1998, when my
hometown’s expansion team be-
gins play. I, like much of America,
was disgusted by the greed, arro-
gance, and disrespect the players
and owners showed the fans. And,
the canceling of last year’s World
Series practically pulled the trig-
ger on my love of baseball. But,
last night, I found out the game
does have its good points, other
than letting you use cool meta-
phoric cliches like “pulled the trig-
ger.” After watching game three
of the World Series, I know now
baseball’s prime use is to let you
think.

Here’s why: The pitcher looks
at the batter. The batter looks at the
pitcher. The catcher signals. The
pitcher agrees. The batter gets out
of the batter’s box to try some

there was a Native American who

Indians would sign him. It’s just

To see why Chief Wahoo is an
offensive image, put yourself in
the place of a Native American. A

and a half hour mara-

thon that was game three and came
to the following point: The Cleve-
land Indians’ mascot is racist.
Now you might be shaking
your head and thinking “oh no,
here’s another one of those people
that 60 Minutes interviews who
marches in front of the stadium
protesting a silly baseball mascot.”
Well, frankly, I would. But, hear

that people can not always identify
racist images and situations be-
cause it does not offend them. For
instance, ‘and on a more serious
level, 40 years ago there were prob-
ably many non-racists who thought
“separate but equal” laws were not
a form of racism. They just ac-
cepted it as the way things were.
Something like “they’re not worse,

teams in the country.
And, you’ re representative is Chief
Wahoo. Look at him. His biggest
problem is not his massive over-
bite. He looks like a grinning fool,
like something out of aBugs Bunny
cartoon. I can easily understand
why Native Americans find that
offensive. Simply, it reinforces a
19thcentury stereotype of “Injuns”
as an inferior people who deserved

to be killed. It would be like nam-
ing a team the Rabbis and design-
ing their mascot as the main char-
acter from Fiddler on the Roof
with more hair and big Kosher
pickle sticking out of his mouth. If
a team were to do that, wouldn’t
popular conception of the Jewish
people f falsely and unfairly change
completely for the worse?

Overall, my point is that de-
spite the best intentions people
might have, insensitivity will be
felt when not considering all the
varied targets of their message,
Different people see things differ-
ently.

_I don’t understand why we
maintain and cherish these sym-
bols when one group of people
overwhelmingly finds it cruel and
ignorant to do so. Names like the
Redskins (noexplanation required)
and cruel caricatures like Chief
Wahoo serve no positive purpose.
Perhaps clever Cleveland fans
could not come up with signs like,
“WINdians!,” but would it take
away from the excitement of the
game ifthe team name was changed
tothe Flaming Rivers or some other
civic symbol? No, it would not.
The fans would still have cheered
just as wildly after Eddie Murray’s
game winning single, along with
some Native Americans,

Bonfires are fun

First of all, I’d like to start
with a juicy tidbit of knowledge
for all you faithful readers. Ac-
cording to a couple professors that
have approached me, Jefe does not
have an accent. Apparently, the
first syllable in Spanish words is
never accented because the accent
is understood. I suppose I should
trust these professors type because
they did attend school for about
half as long as I have been alive,
but Ican’thelp but be disappointed.
El Jéfe just looks so cool. Whén
you just put Jefe, people come up
and ask me who Geef is. That’s
annoying, so I’m gonna leave the
accent. Sorry, Spanish speakers,
but I cater to those who prefer to
wallow in comfortable ignorance

and those who: value surface ap-
pearances over truth. ‘Uhh, those
of you who like my articles, disre-
gard that last sentence.

Now down to the nitty gritty.
Thad a request from a student and
occasional writer that we-not run a
story about beer this week. First of
all, I cannot understand anyone’s
motivation for not wanting to read
more about the Nectar of Life. It’s
tasty, it provides fantastic art in the
form of cool beer commercials,
and it leads energetic young pyros
to do things like light a huge bon-
fire in the middle of the court. But
since this guy is a friend and be-
cause I can’t afford to alienate any
prospective Opinions writers, I
won’t mention beer anymore.

Now back to that fire. Who-
ever, those young bucks were who
triggered off that baby, I applaud
you. That fire on Saturday night
was fun, warm, areal campus bond-
ing point, and most importantly, it
pissed off the authorities. Good
work.

I don’t understand why any-
one would be upset by a contained
fire in the middle of Patterson
Court. I mean, you have a huge
pile of wood and kindling in a dug
out patch just waiting to burn away.
The wood was originally put there
to have a bonfire, so darnit, burn
baby burn. A bonfire unburned is
like a feast uneaten. It’s not like it
was a serious safety hazard or any-
thing. From what I hear, bonfires

do get freny hot =: tend to burn
people who stick body parts in
them. But come on, give us stu-
dents a little credit.

What kind of a moron would
intentionally enter a bonfire? The
police will probably make extrava-
gant claims about the fire's danger-
ousness, butdon'tlisten. Icanjust
see two studly frat boys: “hey
Chaz, dude, I bet I can like hangin
the fire, longer than you, man Loser
hasta shotgun this Schaefers
Light.”

Well, that’s not a good ex-
ample. I would most likely opt for
self-incineration over drinking a
Schaefers. For those of you who
don’t know, Schaefers is often re-
ferred to as “the chewable beer.”

Winos won't touch this one—Red
Bull, though taken from animal
excrement, outsells Schaefers.
Oops, sorry Dom. I mentioned
beer again. I failed. Shucks.

On that note I’m gonna close
this baby. I leave you with this
message: spontaneous igniting of
enormous, potentially deadly fires
is not necessarily a bad thing.
Relax, the self-mutilation factor at
Davidson is fairly low right now.
You’d have to be really stupid and
really intoxicated to injure your-
self at a bonfire, and I know only
two or three people on campus that
normally fall into both those cat-
egories (unfortunately, they all live
with me). Bonfires are fun. We
want more bonfires.

The

art of being bold

I’ve been here a long time, |

and I mean that. Some of you met
me when you were prospectives--
juniors in high school type
prospectives. And] like that. You
know why? Because it means I am
cooler than you.

Not just because I was a lousy
student but also because I know
what the bold type face format is.
Here is an example, giving you
some of my lessons learned.

Ceiling tiles: These tempting,
juicy little obscure polymer fila-
ments in the ceiling just beg to be
broken. They practicaly scream
“Tear me out of the ceiling, you
drunk pudger budger.” And who
can resist. Like the sirens to the
sailors, lonely men, date on lonely
nights, will pull these things right
out of the ceiling. Do net do this.
You know why?’ Because RLO

does not like it when you do and
will make you rearrange the furni-
ture in storage. Not because it
needs it but because they do not

Globe: You all know what a
globe is. (It’s a ball

you might as well not even bother.
None of it is going to work.
Bold face format: Basically
this is a lazy way to write an article.
Coffee: OK. You all know
what this is, but we just

really fast and put your
finger: on a random
spot.) There is also a

got this new Caribou
Coffee shop thing and I
thought I would talk
about it. Caribou will be
popular at Davidson.
You know why? Be-
cause we are all a bunch
of dorks who think we
are older than we actu-

where Chambers is.

Anyway, sometimes, if you are
sneaky, you can get on top of the
globe. Don’t do this, either. The
cops will not like you. When they
don’t like you they stop giving you
rides in their fancy cars. ‘

ou like to go somewhere quiet and
talk about it? Yes. How about my

sitting and discussing Paradise

know you do.

Brueger’s Bagels: Well, it is
official. We are getting one which
officially makes the Davidson
metropolitan area a college town.

a Brueger’s.

Look out Chapel Hill, we are
going to start our own music scene
next and then its all official, you
still have a cooler college town
than we do. (Although ours is much
prettier and the people are much
nicer.)

Kuykendall: No, this does not
spell Kurkendall, but lethim worry
about it.

I will stop boring you now. Yau
can flush the toilet and go do some-
thing productive like watch
"Melrose Place" or maybe drink a
beer.
