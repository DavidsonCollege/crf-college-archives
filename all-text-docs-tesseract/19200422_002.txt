THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 22, 1920.

CLASS BASEBALL GETS
U WAY
SOPHS WINS FIRST GAME
Seniors Defeated in Uninteresting
e. e Commissary Star
8.

Class ball on the Hill opened with
a rush last week, when the Sophs
trimmed the Seniors in one of those
hair-raising exhibitions. The final
count was 4 to 3, it being anyones
game until the ninth when the
Sophs pushed across the necessary

tally.

The batteries of the day were: for
the Seniors, Matthews and Brady.
The “business manager” had plenty
of smoke—(like a Virginia Cheroot)
and Sam was catching like small-
pox. For the Sophs, “Bill? Roberts
was on the mound, with “Winch”
Nash doing the receiving.

The Sophs scores came in the
third, fourth, seventh and ninth.
The Seniors tallies came with a
brace in the seventh and the last
one in the ninth. In the Senior’s
“Lucky Seventh,” Friend Wilson
took one in the slats and got a free
tide to first. Douglas produced a
single, and Matthews slammed one
out for a double. Brady, followed
suit but “Bill” tightened up and re-
tired the side with no more damage.
The ninth inning score for the Sen-
iors resulted from a hit by Mat-
thews, Brady’s sacrifice and a brace
of errors on the Soph infields part.
The Sophs winning run came in the
ninth, when with one man down,
Irwin, M. reached first and then
traveled to second as the sphere
rolled through “Carl’s” legs. He
scored a moment later on an error,
winning the game.

The features of the game were
the hitting of Brady for the Seniors,
and the all-around playing of Irwin,
M. for the winners.

The score:
Seniors -....-_.- 2 000 000 201—3
Sophomores ~------' 001 100 101—4
atteries: Matthews and Brady;

Roberts and Nash.

GOLF CLUB SUFFERS
DEFEAT AT
HAND OF CHARLOTTE

On last Saturday afternoon the
Davidson Golf Club went down in
defeat before the excellent Char-
lotte Club. The Charlotte men play-
ed an excellent game, but the David-
son fellows easily out-drove them.
Thrice Dr. McConnell proved that
you can’t beat brains. The great-
est thrill of the game was enjoyed
when he dropped one in the cup
from the “small” distance of fifty
yards. Mr. Dowd was also good, he
did the starring for Charlotte, and
it was only thru his good playing
that Davidson was defeated.

Dr. McConnell, Prof. Wood,
White and Fricker composed the
Davidson team, while Dowd,
Pharr, Gibbon, and Oldham were
the players for Charlotte. The
score was, Davidson 205, Charlotte

TENNIS TEAM TO
MEET CAROLINA

Tennis enthusiasts will be glad to
hear that Manager Spence has
scheduled a match with the team
from Carolina to’ he held on April
30. The place has not been decided
but there is a good chance of hav-
ing these games on the Hill. There
will be two sets of singles and one
of doubles.

The .students are assured by
Spence that if the games are held
on the Hill, there will be no admis-
sion fee as the tournament last fall

that will show Carolina what real
tennis is. .

off the runner. This allowed two
men to score. Then with Poe at
bat the squeeze play was worked

bunt by Poe, both Shepard and
Richards scored, Richards coming

DIAMOND DUST

With the averages compiled for
the seven games played so far by
the Wildcats, statistics show that
the clan is fielding the old pill for
an average of 939.

Seven of the aggregation are
fielding perfectly. Four others are
in the .900 class while two are just
above .875.

Individual averages find the ball
artists lined up as follows:

Team 189 88 18 939

The infield composed of McArn,
Ratchford, Cassell, F., and Cassell,
E., have accepted 169 chances with
only 9 errors and are fielding the
sphere at .946.

The outfield composed of Craw-
ford, Richards, Shepherd and Poe
have gathered in 28, only one error
having been committeed. That one
occured in last Saturday’s game
with Wake Forest when “Shep” let
one get lost in the sun. This gives
the Wildcat gardeners an average
of .964.

As only one game was played last
week, the position of the leading
four batters did not change mate-
tially. All lost a few points with
the exception of Richards, who
boosted his average 29 points. The
four who are wielding Old Betsy
with the best results are Cassell, E.,
350; Shepard .333; Richards .305;
fend Poe .263.

Wake Forest had the bases
drunk in three innings; had two on
in three other innings; and one on
in two more instances and yet the
best that this delegation, which has
eight .300 batters could do—was to
across a lone Tally.
