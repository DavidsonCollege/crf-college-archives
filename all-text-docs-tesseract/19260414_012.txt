DAVIDSON R.O.T.C. AIDS
IN COLLEGE ACTIVITIES,

The password of PR eeal military men is
“Service.”

Instances without number could be cited
where the Regular Army, National Guard,
and Reserve Corps have rendered valuable
assistance to communities in time of peace,
istance extending in its scope from
maintaining law and. order to providing help-
less women and children with shelter, food
and clothing. Wherever a local emergency
may exist military men stand ready in time
of peace to be of service to those requiring it.

It is not even necessary for an emergency
to exist in order to procure the co-operation
of military men in this country. They are
interested in bettering local conditions wher-
ever they may be at all Davidson
College’s R. O. T. C. is no exception to this
military tradition.

Members of the R. O. T. C. constitute the
Davidson College Band, an organization very
much in at football and baseball
games and one that plays a prominent part
in maintaining college spirit on a high plane.
The desirability of having a band at all out-
door athletic events is undisputed and the Da-
vidson Band is playing its part, metaphori-
cally (7) and actually, toward making Da
vidson College a better college.

There is no municipal fire department in
the town of Davidson,

true that the fire-fighting equipment is not

Parking space for visiting automobiles at
football and baseball games is somewhat lim-
ited. With proper parking of cars there js
room enough for almost any crowd that may
be present but, unfortunately, all car owners
will take more ordinarily, than thes
actually require for parking purposes. In
addition to this they, in the massedo not have
a clear conception of traffic regulations,

Both of these features of handling crowds
are part of the accepted duties of the R. ©,

Due to unavoidable lack of athletic facili-
ties it has not always been possible for every
member of the student body to get the}
amount of physical exercise required for the
best physical and mental development. This
fact was recognized in the past by one mem-

Not over 25 per cent of the colleges and

When an institution is placed on this list
it means that the young manhood in that

assigned him, It means that the youth in
that school has seen the vision of his nation
and has prepared himself to defend it from

Mounted Service School.

Major Johnson was manager of the War
Department polo team last year and team
captain of the polo team that won the cham-
pionship of the District of Washington last
fall. This year he is again team captain of
the War Department polo team and is con-
sidered an authority on this game around
Washington. In addition to polo he is in-
terested in horse shows and usually has sev-
eral entries in the numerous shows held in
Washington.

Aside from horsemanship Major Johnson
is interested in athletics generally and he is
reported to have been the author of the recent
| War Department order putting army ath-
letics on an amateur basis. This action
enables army teams to compete with collegi-
teams under various amateur athletic
rules,

The Davidson R. O. T. C. is very glad
to have Major Stockton and Major Johnson
visit us. Aside from the fact that this is an
official inspection the unit feels that both
gentlemen are our guests in a social way dur-
ing their stay and we hope to make them {cel

and was then detailed to come to Davidson,

Captain Weems’ achievements in army life
have been notable. He is a leading authority
on machine gun work and was designated to
review that part of the first R. O. T. C. text-
book dealing with that subject. He was chief
review of the latest edition
of that publication,

Since coming to Davidson Captain Weems
has come one the college’s most
ardent supporters. Moreover, he has. aided
the school in large measure by his outside
work, He has coached the wrestling team of
the college ior the past three seasons and
turned out one of the best aggregations in
the South this year. In recognition of his
services in this capacity, the “D” Club re-
cently clected him to honorary membership
in that organization, being one of the four
men upon whom this honor has ever been be-
stowed, Captain Weems is still an athlete of
no mean ability, being a star polo player. He

The present Armory building was erected
in 1890 as a Y. M. C. A. building. It served
in this capacity for several years, and had
a gymnasium and basketball court. Monk
Younger, head athletic coach for Davidson,
played basketball on this floor when he was
a student here.

Later the first floor was given over to the
R. O. T. C. department, and the second floor
iw fitted out, the Retest d eres In

rooms, and the R. O. T. C. now uses the
