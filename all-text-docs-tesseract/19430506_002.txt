As we put this last issue of the
“Davidsonian” for the year to bed,
we are well aware of the fact it may
be the last for the duration. We can
think of several dramatic things to

say in the light of this fact, but we
would rather close more simply.
First, we regret that we will not
have the opportunity of carrying on
next fall with the bare beginnings
made this spring. After a shaky start

While on the subject of the staff
we-would express our appreciation

to a few faithful workers who have

stuck by the paper through these last
few, difficult months and made pos-
sible its continued publication: To
George Worth,. who, although the
only regular managing editor re-
maining on the staff, tackled the
mammoth task of getting out assign-
ments, page make-up, and writing
stories week after week without hope
of reward other than the satisfac-
tion of seeing the job done as well as
possible; to Ed Erwin and Bill Ly-
man, who rallied to the cause after
their jobs were supposedly finished
and gave invaluable assistance; to all
the junior associate editors who vol-
unteered their services under simi-
lar circumstances; and to all the
freshmen reporters who gathered the
news.

We canont predict the immediate
future for the “Davidsonian,” but
we earnestly hope that some effort
will be made by those remaining in
college to continue publication of
some kind of newspaper. If this
should be impossible, we shall look
forward to the day when the war is
over. that many of us will return to
Davidson and the “Davidsonian” wills
again exert its voice in the interest
of. a better Davidson.

Based on the startling and shocking best-seller,
Education for Death, this amazing film about
the cruelty of Nazi Germany, and the control the
state has over even that country’s motherhood,
comes to. the local theatre Loday und tomorrow.
