16 THE DAVIDSONIAN BACK PAGE INTERVIEW WONDAY JANUARED9; 1096

Just after announcing
his resignation to the faculty,

President Kuykendall reflects on his
tenure at Davidson.

January 16, 19960

How would you describe your ten-
ure here?

The greatest privilege of my life. It
is gratifying to be ina vocation and
to be invited back to a place where
you began that pilgrimage. I’m
almost maudlin about Davidson. I
just think it’s a great place: Not
that it is perfect and not it that can’t
be improved, and not that it doesn’t
take a lot of hard work to keep it on
track. But thisis home to me ina
very profound sense — so it’s been
very gratifying.

What do you think were the high-
lights of your time at Davidson?

That’s hard to answer. It’s been a
time filled with wonderful experi-
ences that I would not otherwise
have had in terms of meeting people
and working together in good
causes. I’m not sure I can label
“highlights.” I mentioned to one
reporter that some of your prede-

cessors, three or four years ago, .

got wind of a rumor that I was
supposed to be leaving to go some-
where else (which lacked any sub-
stance in fact), but they wrote a
very gratifying editorial encourag-
ing me not to go. That was a
humorous highlight.

Apart from that, I’m glad that
we have successfully completed
the Campaign for Davidson, which
was a very constant personal pre-
occupation for about five and a
half, six years ... I wouldn’t call it
so much a highlight as just a won-
derful experience throughout. I
really never got tired of the Cam-
paign because it was so diverse ...
and because of the worthiness of
what we were trying to accom-
plish.

In what ways do you think the
student body has changed during
your stay at Davidson?

It is in some respects more diverse.
It’s certainly more diverse geo-
graphically. In terms of what they
refer to in the trade as “spike tal-
ents” it is more diverse — special
gifts in music, in drama, in creative
writing, things like that. I think
there’s probably a more self-con-
scious effort on the college’s part
to promote diversity as we recruit
and select the incoming class. In
terms of racial-ethic minorities it
is probably a little more diverse
now. It is not, in my own personal
judgment, satisfactorily diverse in
that respect. There has not been
the kind of growth in that area that
we have expected or desired. One
wonders what can be done that we
haven’t been doing.

On another front; regarding
matters of the stydent body, I’d say

that it is still rather nonpolitical.
And I don’t mean that in-terms of
campus politics: A lot of things are
going on in that regard. We have
real issues to deal with in terms of
our community, responsibilities to
each other, and the things we do
and don’t do. But in terms of the
national and international scene,
this is a generation akin to my own
college cohort ... Students are not,
just now, very much motivated to
become engaged. in politics. It
really is very reminiscent of the
fifties in that respect ... I think the
rank and file of the Davidson stu-
dent community is not actively in-
volved in the political issues of the
day.

In the statement of purpose it says
that the college intends that the
“vital relationship” between the

meaningful and intimate relation-
ship with the college — not just
Davidson but all the colleges.

What changes do you wish could
have happened during your term
as president?

Well, I’ve already mentioned one,
and that is the enhancement of the
racial/ethnic minority presence on
campus . . . The presence of a
critical mass of racial/ethnic mi-
nority students, especially African
American students, has eluded us.
That’s still before us to be done.
Iwould also have liked to have
raised substantially more money
for Davidson’s endowment. One
of the things that has been most
evident in terms of comparisons
between Davidson and other insti-
tutions has been the fact that we are

younger! And again, they seem
more diverse. They come from a
variety of backgrounds, and many

church and the college will re-
main strong. Do you feel ties were
as strong as they were when you
began?

Yes, at least on the college’s part.
But somewhat different because of
the changing nature of American
religious life in the later part of the
twentieth century and especially
the changing nature of denomina-
tional strength and continuity. As
far as the Presbyterian Church is
concerned there does not seem to
be the interest or the engagement
that was present ten years ago. In
some ways it’s a function of the
fact that the denomination itself
has more concerns than it can say
grace over right now ... The most
significant story in American reli-
gion in this last third of the twenti-
eth century has been the demise of
the strength of the mainline de-
nominations. The Presbyterian
Church at one time was giving
money, was sending students, was
doing all sort of things for the
institutions it claimed. It is now
unable to give money and prob-
ably, for different reasons, unable
to give the kind of focused encour-
agement to Presbyterians to go to
Davidson or other Presbyterian
related colleges ... But one won-
ders what the future holds: in terms
of the denominational ability to
maintain contact and to maintain a

under endowed. We make up forit
with other virtues: ... Hard work,
frugality, all those things that you
like to talk about, but in fact we
have to do more with less and keep
on doing it. I would certainly love
to have seen the endowment grow,
and that’s a statement that needs to
be said in context, because when I
came here my recollection is that
the endowment was plus or minus
fifty million dollars. It’s now one
hundred and sixty ona good day. It
ought to be twice that in terms of
our needs and aspirations, I think
... But it’s always going to be a
very demanding job to accumulate
the necessary resources.

A third thing that I would love
to see is athletics at Davidson as a
source of cohesiveness rather than
controversy. We live with a kind
of hand-to-mouth, we’ll-look-at-
it-in-two-years mentality, and
that’s probably not to the college’s
benefit. It is no comfort, but it is
probably accurate to say that were
there an easy answer to this, it
would have long since been dis-
covered and implemented. But
there is no easy answer.

I asked you about changes you
had seen in students. What
changes have you seen in fac-

ulty?

Well, the new ones have gotten

come to a new part of the country
and to anew sort of institution. But
they come to Davidson knowing
they want to teach and knowing
that they have to teach well. They
also come with the additional per-
sonal goal of intending to be a
productive scholar in a particular
field of specialization, where few
(if any) share that particular subset
of knowledge. You can't go find
the “team” of six or eighth people
in your specialty because you're it
you are the person responsible for
this particular subject. You have
to find community here of an intel-
lectual sort, despite the fact that the
people here may not “understand
you” in your living area of special-
ization.

What kind of qualities would you
like to see in your successor?

Well, first of all I would like to see
someone who cares as much about
the institution as I do. Then I
would like to see someone who is

more capable than I in matters ad-
ministrative, but who generally
cares about people and generally
treasures all of the virtues of com-
munity life here.

I hope for someone who is
willing to speak of Davidson as
“family,” not in the sense that we

‘ agree oneverything but in the sense

that we belong together, we share
acommon experience, we’ re stuck
with each other. This is what we’ ve

‘got, and we are going to live to-

gether, and we are going to make it
a meaningful experience of the
whole.

I would like that person to be
an educator, not necessarily in the
specific sense of one who has had
teaching experience, but someone
who understands almost intuitively
the missions and aspirations of the
College and can be college to the
faculty with an appreciation for
the particular demands of their job,
can have either a real or vicarious
enjoyment of the growth of
Davidson students during their four
years, perhaps by going into the
classroom (which has been as great
a single joy as I’ ve had in my years
here) I think that he or she should
take the heritage of the place seri-
ously.

It would be counterproduc-
tive for a person to come who
didn’t understand why those wha
love Davidson do so, at the same
time acknowledging that “‘new oc-
casions take new duties.” Thus we
shape the future in such a way that
it has compatibility with the good
things that come out of the past,
and we strive to move beyond the
liabilities of the past.
