HARVARD GIVES
EXTRA SESSION

Mid-Year Entrance For College
‘Graduates And Experienced
Business Men

Cambridge, Mass., October 25: The
Harvard Graduate School of Business
Administration announced today that an
Extra Session designed both for recent
college graduates and men with some
business experience would begin on Jan-
uary'28, The Extra Session will be open
to students with degrees from accredited
colleges. In addition, well-recommended
men who do not hold: college degrees
but who have had adequate business ex-
perience will be admitted under the reg-
ular provisions governing special stu-
dents. s

Students in the Extra Session will
have the same instruction under the same
faculty as those in the regular first year
class and will be entitled to full academic
credit. The Session will continue until
August 14, thus enabling the students to
enter the regular second-year class in
September, 1935. By the elimination of
vacations, the normal two-year course
is consequently compressed into a period
of only one year and four months.

The shorter period of time of the
Extra Session permits a reduction of
about 25% in room and board expense,
thus making an approximate cost of
$1,000 for room, board, tuition and books
for the seven months of school from
January to August. A limited amount
of financial assistance will be available
to those men who-are unable to defray
all expenses from their own resources.
This assistance includes various jobs
about the School, in the Dining Halls
and on the grounds, as well as the School
Loan Fund which is available to properly
qualified students.

Decision to hold an Extra Session in
January will make available an oppor-
tunity to begin training for business
openings without waiting until the
September term. That such openings
are available is evidenced by the place-
ment of the 1934 graduating class, over
90% of whom had been: placed by the
first of October,

Selected Papers Of
Phineas Spoon

Continued from Page 2
tutional “Bill of Rights”, no matter how
hoary, is Jeffersonian. ‘The balance of
power between State and Federal govern-
ments is immutably fixed by the Consti-
tution. And neither Mr. Roosevelt nor
anyofie else can expect that their eco-
nomic innovations will find either con-
templation or sanction in that instru-
ment.of “political liberty”.

Let’s quit the pretense. Mr. Roosevelt
can’t forever get by with being univefSal-
ly pleasing. His suggestion that eco-
‘nomic security and political liberty can
exist together is balderdash.

The Declaration of Independence and
the Constitution were framed by men
who put political liberty above all other
considerations. The guarantee of popu-
lar freedom against the tyranny of cen-
tralized authority was their triumph. It
may be that economic security is the
insistent popular demand today. If it is,
let’s face it. Let’s stand four-square
and call it by its name. Above all, let’s
s<ount the cost.

YPhere may be nothing wrong with Mr.
Roosevelt's far-seeing, far-reaching
pseudo collectivism. We don’t mind
your bringing a perfect stranger into the
house, Franklin, but for heaven’s sake
don’t try to persuade us that he is dear
old Uncle Samuel!

The unpredictable factor in this in-
tegrated economic system is the psycho-
logical factor. If the “Security” of Ad-
ministration doggerel is to be really ef-
fected, then this hitherto capricious ele-
ment must be frozen. This involves the
regimentation, the standardization of
opinion. Without this totalitarian psy-
chology, “economic security” is political
claptrap. i

Economic security and political liber-

-ty are as impossible of co-existence as
;the immovable body and the irresistible

’ force.

Mammoth Pep Meeting
Set For Friday Night

A colorful shirt-tail parade, one of
Davidson’s better known methods of ex-
hibiting school spirit, will be the feature
of a mammoth pep meeting to be held in
Shearer Hall Friday night. This as-
sembly will precede the game with the
Catawba College Indians which will be
played on Richardson field Saturday.

Paul Warren, cheer leader, says he
expects all freshmen to be present at the
meeting which will begin at seven
o'clock. Upperclassmen will probably be
there in their usual number to cheer and
jeer the freshmen in their snake-like
formation.

trek across the campus.

Newspaper Account Of
Offer To McEver False

Last Friday an article appeared in The
Charlotte News stating that Assistant
Coach Gene McEver of Davidson had
been prominently mentioned for a coach-
ing position at the University of Ten-
nessee, his Alma Mater. When inter-
viewed, McEver stated that he knew
nothing of the rumored offer.

The newspaper account stated that
McEver had been mentioned for
coaching place as a result of the an-
nouncement that Major Bob Neyland,
veteran ‘Tennessee coach, would be
transferred next year. It was under
the tutelage of Coach Neyland that Mc-
Ever achieved All-American fame as a
halfback.

DR. BELK CLOSES
YMCA oERVICES

Successful Fall Program Is Com-
pleted Under Leadership
Of Dr. Belk

Dr. J. Blanton Belk, guest speaker
from Richmond, Va., will close the Y.
M. C. A. Fall Services here tonight with
a talk on “Putting Away Childish
Things”. The program will be held in
Chambers Auditorium at 7:00 P.M.

Dr. Belk is pastor of the Grace Cove-
nant Presbyterian Church of Richmond
and came to Davidson highly recom-
mendéd. He is an outstanding leader in
young people’s work and conducts a
Young People’s Forum in Richmond. His
services on the Davidson campus have
brought forth much favordble comment
from the student body and townsfolk.

The Fall Services were opened at the
Sunday morning church hour with Dr.
Belk using as his subject, “The Quest
for Religious Experience.” ‘This  ser-
mon was based on the eleventh chapter.
of Luke and the text was “Seek and ye
shall find”. In the course of his sermon
he made it plain that “An experience
of God comes only to those who believe
in God. Three definite attitudes are re-
quired of those who make this quest.
First, an attitude toward God that in-
volves reverence, dedication, and trust.
Jesus has embedded this in the Lord’s
Prayer. Second, an attitude of undis-
courageable good-will toward our fel-
lowmen, ‘Third, an attitude of morality
toward ourselves.”

In his other morning services, held at
the chapel hour, Dr. Belk used as his
themes “Storing Up Reserves”, “The
Beast of Sin”, and “Finding ‘Thrills in
Religion”. These talks were especially
directed to the student body.

At Vespers Sunday Dr. Belk spoke on
“The Path of the Just”. His other eve-
ning services were on “Ilerod, the Prince
of Galilee’, “Calvary,” and tonight,
“Putting Away Childish Things.”

Campus Dance Problem
Is Debated By Society

Featuring the meeting of the Euma-
nean Titerary Society last week was an
extemporaneous debate on whether or
not Davidson dances should be held on
the campus. Those taking the affirma-
tive side of this debate were J. A. C.
Andrews and J. L. Shirey; W. M. Wick-
er, R. B. Stewart, and E. F. Horine up-
held the negative side.

During this meeting Horine also gave
a book report on “The Black God”.

The annual election of officers was
held by this society last night. How-
ever, the results of this election have
not yet been obtained.

First Official Parade Of
R. O. T. C. Unit Is Held
The first R. OF T. C. parade of the

year for the Davidson battalion was held

at 3:30 last Monday afternoon, October
29th on the Freshman field.

This was the first official parade for
the local unit, under the leadership of
the newly chosen officers, headed by A.
J. Potter, battalion major.

This parade came as the result of six
weeks of steady drilling and from now
on will be a weekly event. Quite a dif-
ference was noted by the officers in the
snappy appearance of the battalion last
Monday and its straggling appearance
in mid-September,
