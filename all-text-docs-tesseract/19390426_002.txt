Return To Fame
One of the greatest inroads upon college
traditions inflicted by the ‘mad twenties”
Was the retirement the
literary magazine in favor of the contemp-

from campuses of

orary humor publication, Where 30 years
ago nearly every college had at least one
periodical to which students could submit
essays, good poems, and other outstanding
literary writings, we find today only a het-
erogeneous combination of clipped jokes,
cartoons, contemporary columns, and short
“funny” stories—a humorous magazine,
which
would treasure in the future for its display
of promising literary talent. The blame isn’t
to be laid much and
tisers as itis on the present student desires.
Knowing that the’majority of readers prefer
the “Scripts and Pranks” type, the publish-

perhaps, but hardly a volume one

so on editors adver-

ers are loath to accept any of the old style
articles, and the result is that literary tal-
ents of many student writers are stifled for
lack of an opening.

Soon, however, Davidson may expect a
new deal in writing. In a bid to regain their
former positions as literary leaders of the
the
societies are working out a plan to restore
the old-time interest in student literary ef-
forts outside of the English class. Although
the idea is still in an embryo stage the gen-

campus Philanthropic and Eumenean

eral plan will be to gather each year an an-
thology of the best writings on the campus.
These will be bound and placed in the li-
brary, and every few years the best articles
from this anthology will be published. In
addition the two groups will also offer a
substantial prize at commencement for the
best student literary work of the year, to
be selected by a committee of students and
faculty.

Nothing definite has been decided yet.
These are only general gleanings from com-

mittee discussions, and no one can tell
whether there are enough members of the
student body interested in pushing this

drive for good original composition. Regard-
less of this, The Davidsonian congratulates
the societies in taking the first steps for-
ward in the direction of better literary
fruits. If they don’t succeed the campus
will nevertheless know that these organiza-
tions are attempting to live up to their
original ideals. If they do win, they will
have achieved one of the greatest goals ever
sought after on the Davidson campus, and
their shaken prestige will boom sky-high.

Apology
We apologize. In last week’s issue, the
Question of the Week carried an account
of what the Davidsonian staff thqught about
our college magazine. Of course it was all
in fun and no harm was meant, We merely
tried to stage a comeback at the magazine
for their “funny” presentation of a mock
Davidsonian in their last issue. Even though
it was meant in fun, some of the boys felt
that they had been personally attacked. And
The Davidsonian would like to offer apol-
ogies to those hurt. Anyway—it was all in
fun and no harm whatsoever was meant by
it.

Congratulations

Again The Davidsonian has been awarded
a high rating by the National Scholastic
Press. First Class Honor Rating, second
only to the Coveted All-Americna position,
carries with it the title of excellent. Con-
should offered to Editor

on the fine way in which they worked to
attain such a rating. To the old staff goes
much credit but the efforts of a hard-work-
ing editor and business manager was the
margin between a good and an excellent
sheet. Few collegiate papers in the Caro-
linas can boast of such a record.

Help!

The Davidsonian has been edited for the
past three issues by the new staff. Of course,
as these new men take over the duties of
the editors,
their job will be hard. Mistakes will be fre-
quent issues but the staff will
soon be able to measure up to higher stand-
ards with a few weeks’ experience behind
them.

So, are urged to look over these

is our aim and aid from other sources rath-

Quotable Quotes

“An appreciation, acknowledgement and
encouragement on the part of men every-
where of the irresistible, irrespressible urge
to know is needed in these days of 1939.
If collectivism and dictatorship kill the urge
to know, it would be an unspeakable calam-
ity. There would be no superiority, no ad-
vancement, only mediocrity.” Union Col-
lege’s Dr. Edward Ellery believes that col-
leges and universities should foster and en-
courage more than ever thought and knowl-
edge,

“Education within the state is so intri-
cately interwoven with human welfare and
the success of man in business, on the farm
and in industry that one cannot view edu-
cation in a state university without recog-
nizing that it likewise must take its place
within this orbit and contribute within its
scope and function unselfishly to the wel-
fare of all.” Dr. Fred Engelhardt, presi-
dent of the University of New Hampshire,
effectively re-states the place*of the state-
supported institution of higher learning in
modern democratic society.

“Scholarly work is by no means confined
to studying: it necessarily includes writ-
ing. Knowledge isolated in -a_scholar’s
mind is useless unless it. is disseminated.
The only way that dissemination may be-ac-
complished is through the use of language,
and the student must therefore know how
to use English idiomatically and correctly.”
Columbia University’s Dr. C. J. H. Hayes
urges Ph.D,’s to take more English so they
can write better reports and theses.

1-MINUTE SAFETY TALKS

By Don Herold

Motoring Humility

The hardest thing in this world to
“sell” is humility.

I mean the hardest thing to impart
to anybody else is humility.

The very act of trying to give some-
body else humility about anything
arouses everything else in him BUT
HUMILITY.

We are all inclined to shun HUMIL-
ITY because it is a virtue that is so
close to the weaknesses of cowardice
and craven submissiveness. We are
all so scared somebody will get a little
the better of us, if we give them an
inch,

Yet HUMILITY is exactly the
quality that humans need a whole lot
of, to solve a whole lot of their problems.

We have it in golf and in other
sports. We yield. We give the other
player the benefit of doubts. We
praise his poor shots and discount our
own good shots. In other words, we
are not scared to be gentlemen.

But when we climb into an auto-
mobile, we put a chip on our shoulder
anda edad in oe flay, We ie
going to let anybody slip anything
over on us on the road. Pwell, whe

does that so-and-so think he is, trying
to beat me to the crossing!"

Nor do we admit for a minute that
we may have our driving faults. Nor
do we concede that there is a possi-
bility that we MIGHT some day be
the cause of an accident.

No, we are the exception to the rule. '
We are the person who drives fast
but drives well. Only dumbbells have
smashes.

The sooner we all realize that
humbleness and deference and courtesy
at the steering wheel are sporting
qualities, and the sooner we admit
that, even in our hands, an automobile
is an instrument capable of dealing
out death and disaster if we handle it
carelessly or cockily, even for an
instant, the sooner we shall learn
humility towards other drivers, to-
wards Fate, and towards laws of mo-
mentum and centrifugal force, and the
sooner will we cut down the motor |
car's annual American toll which
according to The Travelers Insurance
Company, is 36,800 killed and 967,84
injured,

The automobile is a blessing—but a
dangerous one. rive it with great '

humility in your heart.

Parade of Opinion

POLITICS With another nation-

less are giving serious thought and
action to what is going to happen

more are just speculating on the

subject. students in at least two
universities have organized to the
support of favored candidate.

Most collegians feel that Demo-

cratic politics must wait on some
definite word from President Roose-
velt before definite action can be
taken or definite predictions made.
The dilemma that faces the presi-
dent in the months of practical poli-
tics to come is aptly stated by the
Kansas Daily Kan-
san: Sede

“President Roosevelt is caught be-
tween opposing viewpoints. He
wants business recovery to justify
the but
he is unwilling, nevertheless, to dis-
card the reforms he has brought
about. Whatever course he takes, it
is admitted not only by his friends,
but enemies that he
will continue be a compelling
factor in the political life of the
country for many years.”

The current drive to force Vice-
President Garner into the nomina-

reforms he has_ initiated,

also by his

tion spotlight is one of the moves
being made to dispel the fog that

hides the inner thoughts of the

President and the inner workings
of the Democratic party. Comment-
ing on the Garner drive, the Syra-
cuse University Daily Orange as-
serts: “While conservatives urging
the candidacy of Garner in 1940
say that he is not in the field as an
opponent of the President they be-
the third-term tradition will
stop Roosevelt and they hope that
Garner's popularity will continue to
grow so that by June, 1940, he will
beyaccepted by the President. Cer-
tainly Garner cannot be termed just
another one of the silent partners.
He has madg several good ‘catches’
on his fishing trips and has been
good political bait.”

nesota Daily maintains that “there

Returning prosperity, especially in
the Middle West farm region, would
virtually insure a Democratic vic-
tory. The early Dewey boom, too,
may hinder the G. O. P. plans. Plac-
ing Dewey so prominently in the
limelight will make him and his fae-
tion of the party the target of both
New Deal and rival Republican op-
position. Future rather than past
events will swing the election and
decide the outcome of the 1940. poli-
tical battle.”

Movie Musings

By BOB WILLIAMS

_* *

“LOVE AFFATIR"—Irene Dunne,
Charles Boyer, Maria Ouspenskaya,
Lee Bowman, Astrid Allwyn, and
Maurice Moscovich.

At last these two great screen
personalities have been brought to-
gether to present to us one of the
hit pietures of the day. A Park
Avenue girl, Terry McKay, por-
trayed by Irene Dunne, and Michel
Marnay, international heartbreaker,
by Charles Boyer, combine to give
us an ideal romance, one for which
we have often longed. Lightly they
met, but very deeply did they love,
these two who thought that they
knew life but actually found it in
each other’s arms.

“SOCIETY LAWYER”—Walter
Pidgeon and Virginia Bruce.

The part of the lawyer is played
by Walter Pidgeon, and that of his
client-sweetheart by Virginia Bruce.
The plot is not very unusual, but
is the usual secret love beset by
many difficulties. Virginia Bruce
performs exceedingly well to make
the picture well worth seeing.

“THE > MYSTERIOUS DER”

Not much dope tengindtprostd
loose on this picture, but undoubt-

edly it is a cowboy picture, with
the hero rescuing his true-love
from the hands of the villain. The
new serial “Dick Tracy” is thrill-
ing, but it is certain that Tracy
will get out of the burning plane
that we left him in last week, al-
though it seems impossible.

“12 CROWDED HOURS’—Rich-
ard Dix, Lucille Ball, and John
Arledge.

Richard Dix, of “Cimarron” fame,
plays the role of a newspaper re-
porter who cleans up, single-hand-
ed, a sort of numbers racket, and
a great deal of trouble he has do-
ing it too. This film is recommend-
ed heartily, or even more urgently,
to all reporters. It will make them
realize that they are not even be-
ginning to take advantage of their
opportunities.

This story is well-knit, the love
interest is furnished by Lucille Ball,
and the corhedy by John Arledge.

It is rather sad however to see
| Richard Dix performing in this
| role of newspaper-reporter-vs.-the-
rackets idea.

. The College has provided 14
courts for the tennis players, but
of these 14 at the present time,
approximately five or maybe six
are in presentable shape. The re-

or the surface is poor. Their nets
are a disgrace, and to quote Mischa
Auer, “Confidential, they stink!”
The varsity courts are splendid, but
they are reserved’ for them alone,

STUDENT ART EXHIBIT...
A great many students paid a vis-
it to the exhibition of student art
in Eu hall last week, and_ their
time was rewarded certainly. One
couldn't help but notice the re-
markable likeness of Dave Colvin
on the far wall as one entered. Sur-
realisms, portraitures, landscapes,
still life, and sketches were shown,
but most people had to stand in
line to see a “Davidsonian’s Dream”

- and what a dream!

the Question of the Week of last
issue, he hasn’t succeeded. To those
who aren't so biased in our opin-
ions, he does a splendid job; and
one more item, he has been ac-
cused of courting very heavily in
the vicinity of the local - kinder-
garten.
