The Dean Rusk Program

Ambassador Brynn speaks on Africa

By Graham Ernst

Last Thursday, U.S. Principal
Deputy Secretary of State for Afri-
can Affairs Edward Brynn spoke
in the 900 Room upon invitation
from the Dean Rusk Program.

Ambassador Brynn began by
outlining a series of foursyndromes
that characterize many of the
Africa’s current problems. Com-
pounded with a growing AIDS
epidemic and the likelihood of a
severe drought in the next few
years, Brynn was less than opti-
mistic about the future of this
“deeply, deeply troubled conti-
nent.”

Ina historical perspective, the
’ ambassador compared contempo-
rary Africa’s reallocation of re-
sources and progress of nation
building with Europe during the
Thirty Years War of the seven-
teenth century. The change to a
free market economy and the de-
velopmentof democratic states will
evolve. However, this process will
not come without the bloodshed
evident today.

Brynn’s “Marginalization

Syndrome”. cites the end of the
Cold War as.a source of chaos in
Africa. Without Soviet funding or
strategic importance to the United
States, several governments, in-
cluding Somalia, have fallen to
viscous tribal warfare.

Brynn also referred to the
United States’ inability to under-
stand Africa’s pace in explaining
the development of democracy on
the continent. While the U.S.
should have ambitious goals in
Africa, it is necessary to under-
stand that democracy is a “plant of
slow growth.” Angola is a clear
example, where an election was
forced upon the people late in 1992
in the name of progress, and the
outcome was not accepted by the
losing leader, Jonas Savimbi, and
his party, UNITA. As a result, the
country’s civil war continues with
1000 deaths per day.

The “Somali Syndrome” is
largely responsible for the U.S.’s
inability to keep the slow pace of
African culture. This syndrome
refers to the whimsical U.S. poli-
cies driven by CNN news cameras

and nightly headlines. Pictures of
starving Somali children forced the
Bush Administration to deploy
troops in a humanitarian effort.
Less than a year later, the same
CNN cameras captured gruesome
photos of dead U.S. soldiers being
dragged through the streets ‘of
Mogadishu. As the American
public’s support rapidly waned,
Clinton gave orders to pull thé
troops out.

Despite the negative images
that come out of Africa through the
news wires and on CNN cameras,
Brynn did point out that countries
such as Aratria and Uganda have
stable governments and have prom-
ise for economic growth in the
future. Also, the recent Population
Conference in Cairo showed opti-
mism for the empowerment of
African women as predominant
figures in the next century.

Finally, having served in six
different countries across sub-Sa-
haran Africa, Brynn gave a per-
sonal account of the awesome “‘pu-
rity of life” that the landscape of-
fers.

The Week in Washington
Clinton commits to policy: Invasion of Haiti is imminent

By Andrea Short

Last week, the drama of U.S.-
Haiti relations reached a climax,
and the stage is set fora U.S. inva-
sion. On Thursday, President
Clinton argued his case for invad-
ing Haiti in.a nationally televised
press conference. According to
various polls citing high public
disapproval rates, Clinton faced an
extremely hostile jury.

In an attempt to justify the
invasion and clarify its objective,
the State Department released a
human rights violation report last
week stating that the Haitian mili-
tary regime condones and encour-
ages the murder, rape, assault, and
torture of innocent civilians as a
means of political repression and
social control. The report refutes
the American Ambassador to
Haiti’s April cablegram to Secre-
tary of State Warren Christopher,
which reported that ousted Presi-
dent Jean-Bertrand Aristide and
his supporters had embellished and
invented the existence of wide-
spread human rights violations.
Administration officials claim the
military regime has murdered at
least 4,000 civilians and that sys-
tematic civilian abuse has skyrock-
eted in recent months.

Administration officials hope
to restore the ousted president to
power and maintain his position
until he completes his term in 1995.
President Clinton denies that U.S.
forces will seek out the top three
engineers of the military over-
throw, Lieutenant General Cedras,
police commander Colonel
Francois, and army chief of staff
General Biamby.

Clinton faces strong Congres-
sional opposition as well as public
skepticism. The Haitian military

appears to be the only group un-
concerned with the approaching
U.S. invasion. Poorly trained and
lacking supplies, Haiti’s military

has deteriorated into more of a
joke than anarmy. The army boasts
one ship with a working engine,
one working plane, one helicopter,
and 7,000 uniformed soldiers.
Many Haitians predict their sol-
diers will flee rather than fight
U.S. forces while U.S. sources hope
the men will turn on their own
leaders. Both predictions rely more
on wild guesses than calculated
odds since the clash between U.S.
and Haitian forces will mark Haiti’s
only warexperience in recent years.

Anticipating an embarrassing

liamentary procedure to block a
Republican attempt to force a vote
on the Haiti invasion, later assert-
ing with Speaker of the House
Tom Foley on Clinton’s right to
proceed without Senate approval.
Opposition stems from both sides
of the aisle, and many Democrats
seeking re-election phoned Clinton
last week trying to convince him
to reconsider the invasion.

In the press conference and
throughout the week, Clinton and
his officials tried to define the U.S.
interest clearly and persuasively.
President Clinton stated that to
“protect its interests: to stop the
brutal atrocities that threaten tens
of thousands of Haitians; to secure
our borders and preserve stability

ity of our commitment around the
world,” America has no choice but
to. invade. Many remain
unconvinced by the
administration’s argument which
has touched issues ranging from
stopping human rights abuses to
protecting America’s economic
self-interest. However, the skep-
tics have not lessened Clinton’s
resolve; last week he stated: “I
know the timing is unpopular. I
know the whole thing is unpopular.
But I believe it is the right thing.”

Much of the invasion’s oppo-
sition stems from fear that the U.S.
will become a permanent presence
in Haiti after the initial invasion.

Christopher claims that the U.S.
has no intention to involve itself in
nation building and that the U.S.

will withdraw all forces by Febru-
ary 1996. Most of the invading

force will be U.S. troops, but offi-
cials report that 17 nations have
created a small multi-national force
that will participate in the inva-
sion. After the approximately
20,000 U.S. troops invade, the
multi-national force will enter
Haiti. Once the forces return
Aristide to power, a 6,000 troop
U.N. peacemaking force will re-
place the U.S. forces.
