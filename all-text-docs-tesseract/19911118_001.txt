Student Government Association Grants F.L.A.G. Charter

By Walter Price

The Student Government As-
sociation voted Tuesday, Novem-
ber 12 to grant an SGA charter to
Friends of Lesbians and Gays
(F.L.A.G.). The charter passed the
SGA Senate with 28 officers or
senators voting “yes”, 1 voting
“no”, and 3 abstentions.

Representatives from
F.L.A.G., who attended the Senate
vote were satisfied with the out-
come. “I am extremely pleased
with the outcome and with the
acceptance and understanding that

this campus has shown,” Jennifer
Williams, F.L.A.G. co-chair said.

For the group, their next step
involves the procuring of funds
through the Activities Tax Coun-
cil, to be approved by the Senate,
according to Williams. “Although
we can technically support our-
selves, we need financial support
to pay for membership and public-
ity fees,” Williams said.

In addition, Williams said the
group wanted to begin to further
educate the Davidson campus
about homosexuality through

speakers and open forums.

The Senate discussion of the
proposed charter een with Lee
Hamrick’s recommendation from
the Charter and Bylaws Commit-
tee that F.L.A.G be granted a char-
ter, although Hamrick noted that
the committee’s decision was not
unanimous.

“T’ve felt and others have felt
torn over the issue of granting a
charter. We do not approve of the
harassment and discrimination
faced by many students. For this
reason, we hesitate to vote against

the charter. By granting a charter
many feel we are condoning or
encouraging the homosexual
lifesyle. This is some of the feeling
expressed within the committee,”
Hamrick said.

Hamrick’s report was followed
by F.L.A.G. ‘s presentation of their
proposed charter, which outlined
their purposes in forming this
group. Included in this purpose
were: to protect the rights of lesbi-
ansand gays, to further understand-
ing about homosexuality, to pro-
vide support for the gay commu-

the problems of acquaintance rape
because they “feltit was important
to be in there.”

Terry said, “There was no
logical way to put acquaintance
rape in there, so anew section was
written to deal with rights of per-
sons.” The section also states that

Concern has arisen among

how the money must be spent. The
fact that there are no stipulations
concerns some faculty members.
Many have the opinion that the
_ money ought to be somehow des-

nity, to educate the public about
AIDS, to promote equal rights for
all and finally, to combat homo-
phobia.

ter’s presentation, discussion be-
