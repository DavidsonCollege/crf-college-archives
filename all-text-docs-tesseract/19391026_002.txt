the inquiry, “Do’ you think steps ‘should

in chapel?”

This ie’a unique question in that only one |
scasidle answer can be given --Yes. Li steps
are not taken to prevent this pastime, the
practice will continue until someone is in-
iured, perhaps seriously. Then of course it
will be stopped, but too late.

We suggest that if the student body as a

should take a hand, !!owever, general senti-_

It is intelligent and safe, théreforé, to do’ -

When walking, walk on the left side of the

| A new! word, “turnability,”
has been coined by The Travel~
ers Insurance Company in an ef-
fort to picture for drivers just
what happens in the higher
brackets of speed. A page of the
company’s new highway safety
booklet entitled “Death Begins
at 40” is headed “A Lesson in
Physics for Drivers’ and makes
use of this term for the first time.

“The first law of motion,” the
booklet states, “is that a mov-

. °

ing body tends to continue in uni-
form motion in a straight line,

in proportion to the square of its
speed.

“At 25 miles an hour, how-
ever, youcan makea fairly sharp
turn. At 50 miles an hour, you
ean make only one-fourth as
sharp a turn as you could make
at 25. This explains ‘many acci-
dents in turning and passing at
higher speeds. —--)

So we, the Class of ‘41. put up with a
crowded library of glaring lights, a chemis-
try Jab of antiquated design. and a gvmnas-
ium too small for both dastetihat- gam

_these things would be changed—and soon!

similar comments about other out-of-date
and_inadequate campus structures which are
now playing a vital part in the school life.
Of course, we don’t know whom to blame
for-this delay. The administration has de-
clared both officially and unofficially that
-beautiful plans have already been drawn up;
everything is all set to begin construction on
the new library immediately—if and when
