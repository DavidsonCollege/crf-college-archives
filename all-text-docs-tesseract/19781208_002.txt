The Davidsonian

THE LONE combatant: Kim.

Quips & Cranks:

Three groups fight |
for annual ealitorshig

By MARK BARRETT
Staff Writer

The teams of Diane Odom
and Lucy Phillips, Lisa Brown
and Martha MacGill, and Huk
Kim, who is running indivi-
dually, will give voters three
possibilities in next week’s elec-
tion of editor(s) of Davidson’s
yearbook Quips and Cranks.

In other publications races,
however, Sue Dehoney and
Merideth Durden have no op-
ponents for Miscellany co-edi-
tors, and Taine Alison and
Andy Miller are running un-
contested for co-editorship of
the Wildcat Handbook.

Brown, a sophomore, and
MacGill, a junior are running
because, ‘‘We think we will
enjoy putting a yearbook to-
gether and also think the year-
book will be a good medium for
us to serve the College com-
munity.”

Brown said, ‘‘We have a
great deal of experience, love of
our work, and,..because we are
not in the same class, a broader
perspective on Davidson.‘

‘We hope to greatly improve
the photography, include more
copy, and include a wider
variety of pictures. We will try
to increase sales, and improve
the unity of the yearbook staff.
We will take ideas and input

Two teams line up for Advisor position

By MIKE COOPER .
Staff Writer ..

Anne Eglin and John Wil-
lingham, and Mike McGrady
and Bunny Horine are the two
pairs of Hall Advisors vying for
the position of Freshman Ad-
visor in next Tuesday’s elec-
tion.

Freshman Advisors must
work with the Dean of Students
Office in helping to select and
train Hall Advisors, communi-
cate with incoming freshmen
di gz the summer, work with

Hall Advisors through the year,
and coordinate the Freshman
Hall Council.

According to Horine, “The
present-program will conti-

nue if we're elected.’’ Horine
and McGrady intend to add to

the program such things as a

.new emphasis on community

interaction, a revision of the
orientation schedule to allow
freshmen some relief in the nor-
mally hectic first week, possible
extension of the Big Sister
program to include the whole
year and possibly the creation
of a similar program for fresh-
men men.

This “Big Brother’ program
is also a plank in the platform of
Eglin and Willingham who wish

o *‘provide ail freshmen the

3 opportunity to meet upperclass-

men.”’

Another goal held in common
by both teams of candidates is
the institution of a correspon:
dence program in which inco-
ming freshmen receive letters
from upperclassmen as a further
introduction to Davidson.

“This program would provide
freshmen the chance to get
answers to particular’ questions
about Davidson,”’ said Eglin

_ and Willingham.

‘In order to make the Fresh-
man Hall Council more respon-
sive to the needs of the fresh-
men,’ Eglin and Willingham
suggest, “having each hall elect
two representatives to the coun-
cil and having the upperclass-
men on the council assume an
advisory position.”’

¢

Both pairs of candidates de-
sire to work more closely with
the freshmen particularly>by
spending more time on the
freshman halls.

When asked why they were
seeking this position Eglin and
Willingham responded,
‘Through our experiences as
Hall Advisors, we have been

reininded of some facets of

freshman life which can be
improved.

“We are aware of the respon-
sibilities associated with the
position of Freshman Advisor
and have discussed them, as
well as our plans, with the Dean
of Students Office and the
current Freshman Advisors,”
they added.

Said McGrady and Horine,

‘‘We are excited about the
prospect of taking on the job of
Freshman’ Advisor because we
believe in the Hall Advisor
system as it stands.

‘We would like to accentuate
some of the subtleties of the
freshman year which we feel
could be meaningful .”’

‘In comparison with other
colleges in our AAUP category,
Davidson has declined slightly
in some areas and maintained.
its position in others. Apart
from a strong effort to bring up
faculty salaries, we cannot con-
tinue to recruit the very best.

guished in salary we could
become more competitive in

order to increase her knowledge
of that field.

book together.
‘I have been in photography
since my freshman year
Davidson. I was a staff photo-
grapher for the Update.”
‘‘A yearbook is essentially
pictures, although these pic-
tures should combine to form a

coherent theme. I plan to work ~
on having vary good and inagi ll

native photography in Quips

and Cranks, and to ensure that

this photography tells a story. I
plan to work hard to make

Quips and Cranks a yearbook of —
good quality, and one that ©
clearly reflects the character of ©

next year’s college community,

particularly the senior class.”
Odom and Phillips, both of

whom are freshmen, point to ~

their enjoyment«of yearbook al &

work and experience as factors ~

in their decision to run.
Phillips said, ““‘We hope to -

improve Quips and Cranks

quite a bit, and employ many
new ideas in its composition.

We plan to include more copy, ©

to try to put the staff in good

communication with itself and ~

to begin work earlier in the
year.”

Odom added, ‘‘Above all, we
want to make the yearbook not
a picture book, but an artiney °
one.’

Odom spent three years on
her high school yearbook staff,
the last as editor-in-chief. Phil-

lips worked two years for her ~

high school yearbook, and was

co-editor-in-chief during her —

senior year. Both are staff
members of this year’s Quips
and Cranks, !
The two said they are running
as freshmen because, “Enough
changes can’t be made in only
one year and we have many new
ideas which we would like to
institute right away.”
