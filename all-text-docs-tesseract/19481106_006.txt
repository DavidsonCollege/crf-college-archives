“A week from now and Home-
coming will be over for a whole
year.” A remark optimistically drop-
ped by.a_bedraggled member of the
house committte. To his immaculate
eye a state of pandimonium does
exist at the Fraternity house. And
to this esteemed, brother we rever-
ently, dolf our chapeaux, for the
house has been a bit turbulant with
extensive preparations for a big
Homecoming splash.

To the majority of brothers, how-
ever, a state of expectancy exists,
and in a short time academic pur-
suits will move into a insignificant
secondary place in the sense of val-
ues of the Phi Delt brothers and
pledges. “Two Victories to Win”
has been adopted as the theme of
the occasion; but the third front,
will more than likely prove to be the
most préssing and demand _ the
most from the large store of tricks
of. the Phi generals. Come on girls
we are ready.

The forthcoming, festivities have
most of the fellows counting the
hours, and fighting smirks at ‘the
mention of Homecoming, but as the
old saying goes there is a dark
cloud with every silver lining.

The current mystery around the
Phi Delt house is what has happen-
ed to Bobby (Caruso) Patton's pin.
It just vanished after an extended
stay on the Stetson U. campus. He
was preceeded back to the campus
by numerous rumors which he at-
tempted to discredit. But in the ab-
sence of any substantial evidence,
namely his pin, he does not have a
leg to stand on. (He says his room-
mates hid the pin to play a joke
on him, Yeah!)
