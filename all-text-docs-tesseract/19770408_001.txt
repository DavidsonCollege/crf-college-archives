Return on evaluations disappointing

Students fail to assess courses

By CHARLES ERWIN
Asst. Features Editor

SGA _ President Thom
Young’s efforts to achieve a
valid student course evalua-
tion system have suffered a
serious setback.

In the face of widespread
criticism that the fall term
evaluation results were totally
meaningless due to poor re-
sponse, the winter term re-
sponse has proven even lower.

Dana English, who is in
charge of the SGA Evaluation
project, reported that 1465
forms were completed and
returned to the SGA for winter
courses.

two-part series

This is 62 less than the 1527
forms which were turned in for
fall term courses. .

“IT do not know whether the
decrease is due to the Sena-
tors’ laziness or the people just
not filling the forms out,” said
English.

Young was expecting
a big rise in returns. One
month ago, before the dorm

the winter course forms, he
projected the rate of return
would be much greater due to
student interest in the fall
term results.

Young has been pushing for
the administration to take on
the project so that students
will either have to fill out the
forms or signify they don’t
want to respond.

In this way, he said that the
low return problem would
disappear.

However, for the adminis-
tration to accept responsibility
for the programythe Faculty
Professional Affairs Commit-
tee (PAC) will have to support
the idea.

The College Constitution
states that all faculty evalua-
tion procedures must be form-
ulated by the college president
“in conjunction with the fac-
ulty’’.

Professor David Kaylor,
present PAC chairman, said in
reaction to the low rate of
return, ‘‘If the students have
that low an interest, it makes
one wonder about the real
value of it (the evaluation).”’

Professors ‘‘have the same
anxiety about having themsel-
ves évaluated in public as

students would if their grades
were published,” said Kaylor.

PAC has flatly come out
against having official admini-
stration evaluation forms re-
leased to students.

Young, on the other hand,
insisted that any evaluation
form would have to be made
public ‘‘as long as I’m in
office.’’ He refused to compro-
mise on the issue.

Although it is unclear what
position the new academic
vice-president will taken on
the matter, it appears the two
viewpoints are irreconcilable.

Thom Young has said, “If
the evaluation forms can’t be
institutionalized within the
administration, then they will
be institutionalized within the
SGA.”

But this proposal was
hinged on a higher rate of
voluntary student coopera-

tion.

Young has stated that the
present results are statistical-
ly inaccurate. It is uncertain
whether or not the SGA can
come up with a means of
achieving higher response.

It will be unclear for some
time, perhaps until the SGA
evaluation booklet is distribu-
ted, whether the whole stu-
dent evaluation program is in
jeopardy.

Faculty attempts to estab-
lish evaluation policy reached
a similar standstill in 1973
when the Board of Trustees
rejected the PAC plan for
evaluation.

Kaylor said that at no
time did PAC receive a full
account of why the plan was.
rejected, although they were
able to get a general idea.

U.S. District Court upholds
State tuition grant program

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor

A U.S.district court recen-
tly ruled to uphold. tuition
grants from the state of North
Carolina to church-related col-
leges.

The case pertained to Bel-
mont Abbey College and Pfeif-
fer College, but the implica-
tions extend to all 38 of North
Carolina’s private institu-
tions.

If the grant program had
been ruled unconstitutional,
aid to all 38 private church-
related North Carolina colle-
ges could have been disconti-
nued. Both the state and
private colleges argued that
tuitions of private institutions
have risen to the point that
state schools would be over-
burdened with students if the
state does not help pay the
private tuitions.

The judges reasoned that

the tuition grants do not®

violate the first amendment

provisions for separation of
church and state. The court
felt that the colleges in ques-
tion are not “‘pervasively sec-
tarian,’’ or functioning in a
manner solely to promote reli-
gion.

The judges overruled Pfeif-
fer College Professor Michael
Smith who maintained that
state aid was unconstitutional,

“It encourages students to
attend colleges where they will
be influenced to become or
remain religious,” he said.

Last year the state provided
$8.6 million in tuition aid for
23,000 private college stu-
dents last year.

North Carolina has three
separate programs which
channel state funds into pri-
vate education. Under the first
program funds are granted to
private colleges in the state on
the basis of the number of
North Ca:ciuua resident stu-
dents enrolled in them on a

full-time basis.

The second program grants
$200 for each academic year to
each North Carolina resident
attending college full-time.
The college then allocates that
money to those students
needing financial aid.

The third program consists
of $650,000 in state funds
appropriated for scholarship
grants to post-secondary
school undergraduate stu-
dents on the basis of financial
need.

The decision was handed
down by U.S. District Judges
Jame McMillan, Woodrow
Wilson Jones, and Clement
Hanesworth.

McMillan warned the col-
leges that by accepting state
aid they may become subject
to state control. If stat
subsidies become too large,
“the power to withdraw them
will bethe.powsr to control the
private schools they benefit.’’

Pitcher sales will cease at

ted to leave the 900 Room by

No non-students under 18
(except dates) will be admitted
to the Union unless accompan-
ied at all times by an author-
ized student or adult, or unless
granted permission from Un-
ion Director C. Shaw Smith.

The board expressed its
pleasure with students’ con-
duct in the Union during the
recent Spring Frolics activi-
ties. Last week the board was
considering drastic measures
to eliminate increased vandal-
ism and abuse of the Union’s
rules.

“T continue to be amazed at
what good things students can

do if they want to,’’ said
Director C. Shaw Smith.

“It’s up to the students
themselves to make things
work, and when they decide
to, there is nothing that can
compare. During this last
weekend, the whole direction
seemed to be changing.

Plans are being made for a
public relations campaign:
manned by students, to in-
form their peers of the rules
and responsibilities stemming
from use of Union facilities,
Also, a letter has been sent to

taining to vandalism in the

The admissions staff has
completed evaluation of the
folders of over 1500 applicants
and has accepted 600 candi-
dates for admission to the
class of 1981.

Forty percent of those who
applied were accepted, down
from last year’s acceptance
rate of fifty-three percent.

‘‘The percentage that we
accepted is /lower because the

and the size of next year’s
freshman class was cut
down,” said Dean of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid H.
Edmunds White.

600 earn admission

‘‘The competition for the
103 places for women was the
toughest I’ve seen in my 22
years of admissions work.
Just unbelievably tough.

‘We had to put some really
great- women applicants on the
waiting list,’’ said White.
Only 180 of almost 400 wo-
men’s applicants were
accepted.

“For men, much the same
factors were involved, but not
to such an extent,”’ he said.

“There was a slight increase
in men’s applicants from last
year (980 to 1110); the quality
was at least as good, and we
