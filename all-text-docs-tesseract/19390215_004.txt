DAVIDSON SPORTS

February 15, 1938

THE: .DAVIDSONIAN

Page Four

For the first time Davidson is practically assured of being represented
in the Southern Conference tournament at Raleigh in early March.
Last year great things were expected, but dfter the ‘Cats lost several
games by one and two point margins they were out of the running. This
year it.has been different. Although the Wildcats haven’t won so many
close decisions, they have had more for them than against, and have
gone on, to beat practically every team in the conference at least once,
Needing only one more victory berth in the tourney, the
"Cats meet Citadel as favorites in a Saturday night game which should
just about fix things up for the Raleigh affair. Wake Forest will un-
doubtedly enter the competition as favorite, but the ‘Cats will have
their say about that before the playing is over.

Not pre-tourney favorites last year, Duke’s Blue Devils came
through to take the title. The ’Cats appear to be in the same spot
this time and there are 664 Davidson students pulling for them.
But of course this is presuming (and we have good reason to pre-

to cinch a

sume) that Davidson will win one more game.

Hard luck seems to hit the Cats all at the same time. First
J. D. Hicks came down with a bad cold, and then John Tice hurt
his side. However, J. D. came back with a bang as he led the
team to two victories last week with his high-scoring immediately
after leaving the infirmary. John will be all right soon too, it is

hoped, and able to perform up to his usual standard. :

Much praise is due to the spring football boys who are training
for the campaign next fall. With most of the first team gone, Coach
Gene McEver is faced with the problem “of filling’ big holes in the
line-up caused by graduation next June. the members of
this year’s freshman team are being counted on to do duty next year,
along with the To brighten
the prospect there are several of last year’s team back. Marvin Pen-
nington, George Richmond, Footsie Cowan, Gales McClinto¢ék, Horace
McCall, Poss McLean, Tubby Hand and Bill Bolin will be back to lend
their experience to the team

Several of

“Beesters” and reserves from this year.

The gang out practicing daily on the
freshman field doesn’t have the usual Saturday games that furnish a
break for fall training and relieve the monotony, but they are faithfully
drilling on the fundamentals that make or break a team.

With the spotlight on basketball we step aside for a time to
take a shot at baseball. With spring on deck the sluggers and
flychasers will soon be out chasing the pill around. Two or three
of the pitchers are already limbering up their arms for the coming
season. Eddie Steere and J. D. Hicks are ready to twirl as old
hands, and with “Diz” McLean working on his control Davidson
should be well-fixed for pitchers. “Hayseed” will be out there cut-
ting the corners with the others.

through school by consistently racking down high score at the local
bowling alleys ... The Phi Gams and Pi Kapps will fight it out for

“Able Defender”

Johnny Tice, diminutive little guard from Blacky, Ky., has been

guarding the big boys all season.

Used by Coach Shepard to cover

against their rivals’ high-point men, John has constantly played an
alert floor game in holding his men to low score while racking up

quite a few points himself.

This is Johnny’s second year as a starter

and he has become recognized as one of the best guards in the con-

ference.

Campus grapevine channels have
recently cast it abroad that David-

colorful stalwarts in the Carolina
Golden Gloves Meet in Charlotte.

Heading the list is “Battling Bob”
McClelland, the “Tennessee Tiger,”
who will fight in the novice heavy-
weight class. “Press Box” McLean,
the Morganton Terror, will vie as
a light-heavy, while “Bounding Bill”
Ross rounds out the entries as a
featherweight. Although these boys
are not veterans of the squared cir-
cle, all are known to be aggressive
and clever battlers.
