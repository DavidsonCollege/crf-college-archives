Tooo- piritaal Journeys dering the mouth of Ramadan

Discovering spiritual identity through fasting

By LEANDRA RICE
Special Contributor

A time: for fasting, reflection, and an
opportunity to become closer to God,
Ramadan is the holiest month in the Islam.

The Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet
= Muhammad during the
' month of Ramadan, and
_ Muslims commemorate
; this event by fasting for
an entire sacred month.

From sunrise to sun-
set a fasting Muslim
may not eat or drink
anything.

‘Fasting serves a
number of purposes. It
Rice ’07 is an opportunity to
practice self-control and to cleanse the body
and mind.

But most importantly, fasting allows
Muslims to feel the peace that comes from
spiritual devotion while also strengthening
kinship ties with fellow believers.

So why would I, a Christian student raised
in an evangelical, Protestant, and extremely
religious family choose to participate in this
decidedly different tradition?

I have always been interested in Islam,

ever since I took a comparative religion class
in high school that focused on the six’ major
religions of the world.

My teacher encouraged us to examine
each faith from a his-
torical and theologi-
cal perspective,
while challenging us
to step outside of our
current belief sys-
tems and to embrace
new ways of think-
ing about God.

I began to have
conflicting feelings
about my religious
beliefs and how I
experienced God in
my daily life. At one
point I even consid-
ered converting to
Islam.

When I came to
Davidson I took a
class called “The
Trials of Jesus,”
which really challenged me to think about
how the Bible is structured and shaped the
way Christianity is practiced today.

However, I began seriously considering

Islam again when I took an “Introduction to
Islam” class at Spelman College last semes-

ter.

I learned a lot about the history, intricacy,
and beauty of Islam
and was encouraged
to reexamine my
faith and the way that
I want to live my life.

After much reflec-
tion, studying and
soul-searching, I
decided that I wanted
to actively expand
my understanding of
Islam.

I study the Qur’an
and the Bible daily,
which has not only
increased my knowl-
edge of both faiths,
but has also chal-
lenged me to think
about my future path.

Keeping the fast
this month has been a
part of my y exploration and has strengthened
my relationship with God.

Participating in Ramadan this month has
been an unexpected blessing.

It has given me further incentive to study
the Qur’an and to contemplate what it means
to be a Muslim.

Fasting from sunrise until sunset is a
tremendous sacrifice which requires constant
self-control and continuous self-reflection.

There are times when I’m so hungry that I
can only whisper a prayer to God, asking
Him.to help me make it through the last hour
of sunlight.

This month has allowed me to discover the
true meaning of Islam, while encouraging
me to apply these concepts to my daily life.

Although fasting has been difficult, I have
a wonderful support system of Christians
and Muslims here at Davidson who are
encouraging me to learn more about myself
and who help me to understand my beliefs.

I have not officially converted to Islam
because I believe that this is an important,
life-changing decision that should not be
taken lightly.

However, the question of conversion is
less important to me at the moment than the
exploration of the relationship between the

‘tradition I have been reared in and the tradi-

tion that I am coming to as an adult.

My Ramadan experience, with all of its
trials and triumphs, has been one that I will
cherish for a lifetime.

Practicing faith to appreciate the gifts of God

By Faris AL MAZRUI

People start talking about Ramadan a
month before it comes.

“Ohhh it has come back to us!” slip into
conversations all the time as the sacred
month approaches.

People go out to
- see the crescent at
.sunset the night
_ before to observe the
beginning of
Ramadan.

Families rush to
the supermarket the
day Ramadan begins
so they can get all
Al Mazrui ’07 the ingredients need-
ed for the creative meals they will be mak-
ing.

Television channels have cooking pro-
grams in the afternoon so people can cook as
they watch. And so the fasting begins...

We follow the Prophet’s tradition of wak-
ing up before the break of dawn to eat a meal
before the fasting begins.

Fasting is a very unique experience. We
never appreciate God’s gift of food until we
abstain from it.

Only then do we really get a glimpse of
what people who suffer from famine and
starvation go through.

Hence charity and contributions to the
poor go up.

Family ties strengthen as we go through
the challenge of waking up before dawn and
being steadfast during the day.

I cannot thank my mom enough for wak-
ing us up and insisting we put something in
our stomach to sustain us throughout the day.
She would be the one to wake up first out of
care for all of us: my dad, my two sisters, and
my younger brother.

Community bonds strengthen as well.
Men usually gather around at the mosque at
sunset to break fast on a light meal of dates
and water and then pray together.

This creates an opportunity for people

who do not know each other to get acquaint-
ed and gives them a sense of unity under one
society, one God.

After the sunset prayer, people invite dis-

tant and close relatives and friends to feast,

together, bringing families together and
enhancing communal ties.

Working hours change during Ramadan.
Work and school begin on average an hour
later than normal and end either at normal
times or even earlier; class times get com-
pressed.

The companies that end earlier have their
employees return at night after the last
prayer (which is after breaking the fast by
about two hours) to work a little more.
People in general stay up late in Ramadan
either to get in the many calories they need
in one day or pray and recite Qur’an.

The last 10 days of Ramadan are believed
to be the holiest.

People do more good deeds and remem-
ber God more.

They pray more at night, recite more
Qur’an and give more to charity. Some even
go to Mecca to perform the “umra,” which is
a one-day pilgrimage. This is not to be mis-
taken with the once-in-lifetime five-day Hajj
that is one of the five basic requirements of
Islam; mandatory for those physically and
financially able.

The end of Ramadan is capped off by
commemorating the month-long fast on a big
day at the beginning of the next month of
Shawwal called Eid Al-Fitr; direct transla-
tion: celebration of breaking the fast, in
which people are forbidden to fast.

Eid Al-Fitr is a very joyful day where we
start the day by praying the special Eid
prayer just after the dawn prayer, the first
prayer of the day.

- After that, we visit friends and relatives
all day and exchange good wishes. Children

‘come along and collect the Eidiyyah, small

gifts, candy, or money.

Fasting here at Davidson College works
nicely for me by clearing up my schedule of
lunches and early dinners that interrupt work
time.

That sway I can have most of my work
done before sunset.

Granted as the sun gets closer to the hori-
zon I do get more tired and tempted to take a
nap until sunset, but I resist from time to
time.

It is very thrilling when the clock strikes
an.hour before sunset. I have something to
look forward to every day.

So no matter what I go through during the
day from stresses and pains, there is always
something exciting and happy at the
evening, which makes life for me much more
pleasant at Davidson.

I remember fasting Ramadan during my
freshman year was quite difficult at the start.
I was not used to fasting while being sur-
rounded by non-fasting, very active, and
stressed-about-work people.

But now I have acclimatized, and having
the group of Muslims on campus helps.

I cannot help. but remember good times
when I think of Ramadan.

Though it may be surprising for non-

Muslims, we Muslims indeed feel a sense of
loss as Ramadan passes by.

Some of us remember times where we
could have prayed more or thanked God a
little more.

‘This is because Ramadan is the holiest
month in the Islamic calendar and good
deeds are rewarded seven times more than
normal, while sins are still counted the same.
The Prophet Muhammad once said, “Those
of you who are physically and financially
able to get married, should get married. And
those who can’t are highly advised to fast.”

Indeed fasting is a form of self-discipline.
Not only in the physical sense but mentally
too.

I go through the rigorous day avoiding
thoughts of food and fatigue from low ener-
gy; I remember that I am doing this for God,
and so whenever a sinful thought invades my
mind I repel it with more conviction and
determination. I would tell myself, I am not
abstaining from food just to end up commit-
ting sin.
