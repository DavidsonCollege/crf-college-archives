“V’M NOT A FOLK SINGER’
Leonda wows ‘em at the d.

Leonda: Skilled,
Highly Informal

By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer

“Are they enjoying it?” Leonda asked, as it be-
came time for her to return to the stage at the Hungry

d Wednesday night.

The statement characterized her highly informal,
audience-oriented performance at the Hungry d.

Leonda wore a blue tent dress and white stock-
ings, with a blue ribbon in her shoulder-length black

hair and a curious horse-
chestnut necklace.

Leonda sang in a_ sure,
powerful voice. frequently
flashing a broad smile. She
played the guitar skillfully in
keeping with the adept na-
ture of the entire perform-
ance.

“I picked up playing the
guitar from listening to rec-
ords of blues and Indian sing-
ers and from just fooling
around with it.’ Leonda said.

“I listened to a lot of
blues singers like John Lee
Hooker and Muddy Waters,
and [{ wanted to express my-
self. I think if you're in a
medium, like music or art,
it will naturally come out and
you'll start performing.” Le-
onda said, explaining how
she started singing.

“I'm a contemporary sing

er: I'm not a folk singer.”
she added.

Leonda, who is a Cherokee
Indian born in North Caro-
lina, said that she does not
particularly like to be publi-
cized as an Indian.

“IT don't like this whole
business of being a Negro,
or a white or an Indian: I
mean, after all, we're all
people.”’ said Leonda.

Describing her perform-
ance. Leonda said they are
mostly spontaneous. ‘‘Some-
times I do the same songs.
but you never know. It all
depends on how I feel. and
how the audience reacts.”
she said.

“IT try to sing about groovy
things, yesterday, today and
tomorrow.” she said. pro-
nouncing “‘groovy” in three
syllables, *‘ga-roov-vee.”

After the tapping ceremony,
Will Terry. minister of the
Davidson College Presbyter-.
jan Church, gave the keynote
address.

He said that while a ma
jority of Davidson students
were accustomed to assum
ing positions of leadership
before coming here. only rela
tively few are actually able
to demonstrate their poten
tial.

Therefore, he- continued.
the students who hope to at-
tain positions of leadership
must be willing to accept cer
tain sacrifices and assume. a
constructive attitude toward
life at Davidson. He said that
leaders must seek respect
before popularity.

Terry concluded that the
position of the college in fu-
ture years depends on the
initiative taken by student
leaders, because they, more
than the faculty or adminis-
tration, will influence the de
velopment and improvement
of the school.

cil members and several
members selected from the
student body at Jarge. The
problems it will deal with aré
those of fires. dormitory
damage. open. dormitories
open to women visitors, the
drinking question and other
related issues. :

Council President Tem
Earnhardt. who initially pro
posed the committee. sug
gested that two faculty mem
bers be appointed to serve
on. the committee and that
the committee hand in its
final report to the Faculty
Disciplinary Committee for
examination.

Earnhardt said he felt pun
ishment in many. cases. is
just a_rap on the knuckles.”
especially in the cases for
which campusing is the pun.
ishment. He said he hoped the
committee can find a form of
punishment which is “more
corrective.”

Junior Joe Murphy accused
Earnhardt “of taking the ad
ministration’s side.’ and
senior Mike May said most.of
the dormitory damage was
harmless and “all of us do it
at one time or another.” ~

Earnhardt said one matter
that concerned him is fires
in the dormitories and that
such fires are not harmless.
“TI think students causing
most of the dormitory dam-
age are acting like high
schoo! kids and ought to stop
it."" he added.

“A study of existing pun
ishments may bring forth
some more realistic ap
proaches to stopping need
less destruction of dormitory
property,’' he said.

The council discussion fin-
ally centered on the realm
of student responsibility, and
the council decided such a
committee would be helpful.

bers appointed to serve on
the committee.

Bill Watson urged the mem
bers of the committee to
finish their report within a
month so that the Constitu
tion Revision Committee
could have the benefit of their
findings.

Earnhardt pointed. out. that
it would be advantageous to
add faculty members to other
student council committees
and perhaps various commit
lees of the YMCA. College
Union Board and Interfrater
nity Council. ‘so that they
might give these committees
the advantage of their know
ledge and interest in parti.
cular areas."

Bud Cousar reported that
his investigation concerning
cuts in physical education
was incomplete. but he. said
that there is a possibility of
additional cuts.

ed to the N. C. Superior Court
