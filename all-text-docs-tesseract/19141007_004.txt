Newberry Coming to Get CLE

Revenge Oct. 10.

Newberry Has Good Prospects For
a Strong Team.

On this Saturday, October 10. New-
berry, College will play here “on the].
Hill” Last Fall they puc up a game,
plucky, gritty fight against the “Red and
Black Machine.” Of over half a dozen
games played last season the game to
Davidson was the only one lost, With
practically every one of last year's Var-
sity men back, ‘and with about a dozen
strong new men, they will have a good,
strong team. Parrish, a former star foot
hall plaver, is coaching Newberry, and|*
for several weeks has been getting his
team in preparation for Davidson on
October to. In the write-up to several
dailies the report says: — “Newberry ts
looking forward to their Davidson game
with a view and determination to pet-
ting revenge for last season's defeat.
Much interest and lots of * Pep is being
manifested in daily foot ball scrim-
mages here.”

Newberry College has a student body
thar will compare in numbers favorably

“with Diwidson. ‘Vhe game Saturday,
judging from advanced “dope.” should
he an interesting and good game. New-

berry teams always have the “rep” of
being game and hard tighters.

Newherry defeated the strong Porter's
Military Academy of Charleston last
Saturday 20 to 0, and Porter's always
puts vut a strong team.

* Newherry's line up: Among the new
men showing up well are: Ashbaugis.

WEARERS OF “FHE °D.”

Last night the Wearers of the "1D"
met in their reom under “Eu” hall.
Many matters of interest were discussed,
During the remainder of this vear cer-
tain magazines, periodicals and — daily
newspapers will be kept on the cable in
this room, and any member can go in at
any time.

The room since last Spring has been
improved considerably in looks. On the
walls of this room hang the pictures of
various foat ball, base ball and track
teams for the past decade. A scrap-book
in which an account of every game for
the past year or so, and other athletic

“dope” on teams, kodak pictures, etc.,
is kept in this room. ‘The old members
at the meeting were: Howell, Anderson,
Gilchrist. Johnson, Crayton, Kluttz,
McKinnon. Glover. Stough, Brown,
Somerville, Walker and Coach Fetzer.

CRAWFORD WINS SINGLES.

In the semi-finals in singles, Norman
Johnson defeated Tom Finley: score,

6-4. 6-3, 6-1; Dave Crawford defeated} L

Reese by default.

In the finals the two members of the
Varsity Doubles team battled for the
Singles Tennis Championship. In a hard
fought match Crawford defeated John-
son, 8-6. 6-0, 6-4, winning the Singles
championship.

The first set was probably the hardest
fought and most exciting match seen on
the Hill. Johnson weakened perceptivelv
after the first set, and Crawford plaved
his usual steady game, so fatal to his
opponents.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN. October 7, 1914

MSON POWERLESS  BE-

FORE RED AND BLACKS.

. (Concluded from page 1)
White. Howell, Laird and Anderson all

played great ball, but every man on the]

team fought hard. The team worked
together like an giled — machine, and
showed splendid early season form.

For Clemson, Captain Schilliter, Ma-
jor, James and Webb played well.

Davidson was penalized more than
Clemson, but during the fray gained
almost twice as much ground, 195 yards
to the opponets’ 115. The ‘Tigers had
22 yards on Davidson in the first half,
but Davidson's total of 124 yards in the
last half to Clemson's 30, tells the tale
of the powerful onslaught at the end, of
the Red and Blacks, against “the best
team that Clemson has had in six years.’

The game was a credit to the college,
to the coaches, and to the fine team it-
self, and every Davidsonian, far and
near, not «aver-confidently, but in very
truth proud of it. The line-up follows:

Davidson. Position. Clemson.

PEDEN ‘TO ASSIST.

“Jack” Peden wilt assist Coach Fet-
zer and Harris with the toot ball squad
for several weeks. Peden is a valuable
man and will be a big addition to the
present strong staff. He played at Dav-
idson several. vears, and last year made
his letter on Pennsylvania’s star team.
We are glad to have him here.

TRACK PROSPECTS GOOD.

Coach Fetzer called a meeting of the
track men and a goodly number re-
sponded to the first call. Davidson
should put out a good team this vear.
Gilchrist can be counted on as usual for
100 and 220-vard dashes, also low hur-
dies; “Preacher” Morrison and Kluttz
are also on the job for these two entries;
Ives, a new man, is fast, and should
make a valuable man. Johnson, N.. the
record-breaker jumper, will do his share.
Perry is hurdling even better than last

year. “Slim” Glover, and Anderson,
H., will toss the weight. Kluttz
also runs 440 and broad jumps. There

are many others who will make valuable
men for this team, and Coach Fetzer,
who has much experience in track coach-
ing, wants every available man who is
not playing foot ball to come out at once.

Mr. N. A. Watt, of Thomasville,
Ga., is to be married to Miss Mary
Lindsay, October 15.

Mr. Arthur Laird. brother. of -J. P.
Laird, was on the Hill last Saturday.
