Wildcats fall in Colonial opener to Lehigh 43-20

By BRUCE NEWSOME

The Davidson football team
was unable to put everything to- ”
gether Saturday as it lost its Colo-
nial League opener to the Lehigh
Brown and White 43-20. The of-
fense was unable to get on track in
the Ist half, while the defense
played well, and in the 2nd half
the offense got in gear, but the
defense struggled.

In the first half Davidson was
only able to gain 36 yards total
offense. Twice when it appeared
that the Cats might be starting a
drive, quarterback Peter Hughes
had perfect passes dropped by his
receivers. On the other 5 series,
Hughes was scrambling for his
life as the Brown and White de-
fensive line spent much of the half
in the Davidson backfield.

Lehigh drew 1st blood midway
through the Ist quarter. The
Brown and White utilized their
short passing attack to drive 67
yards for a touchdown. The
holder fumbled the extra-point
snap to leave the score 6-0.

However, disaster struck with
1:52 left in the second quarter.
The week before against Presby-

din’s punt at the Davidson 10 yard
line. Another Lehigh player re-
covered the blocked kick and ran
it in for a touchdown to increase

In the second half Davidson’s
offense awoke and gained. 291
yards total offense and 20 points; an impressive 92 yard drive in 15
however, Lehigh scored 24 points \, Plays for their 1st touchdown.

Midway through the third quar-
ter, the Davidson offense went on

The big play on the drive was a
25 yard completion from Hughes
to Horace Hamm which gave the
Cats 1st and goal at the Lehigh 4.

However, the defense was.un-
able to stop the Brown and White
on their next drive. The touch-
down was scored on anice 30 yard

Davidson’s punting woes con-
tinued on the next series when the
Lehigh kick réturner took Har-
din’s punt 64 yards for a touch-
down to make the scre 36-7.

Despite being down by so
much, the Wildcats did not quit.
On first and ten from the
Davidson 38, Hamm burned the
Lehigh secondary and Hughes hit
him with a 62 yard touchdown
pass.

Both teams scored touchdowns
on their next possession to round

Two possessions later Lehigh
again used their quarterback’s
sprint-out passes to add another
touchdown, but the 2 point con-
version attempt failed so the score
remained 12-0.

Although the defense gave up
two touchdowns, it played pretty
well since the offense did not give

terian, the Cats had punting prob-
lems as the Blue Hose almost
blocked 2 kicks. In spite of a
change in punters this week, the
punting game had problems as
Lehigh’s Jim Benson came from
the left end to block Chris Har-

the Brown and White’ s lead to 19-
0 at the half.

Head Coach Vic Gatto said af-
ter the game: “We wanted to go in
down 12-0, but there is a big dif-
ference in being down 12-0 and
19-0.”

several opportunities for each side, but no goals.

The second half remained tied until the fifteen minute
mark, when the Paladins, playing a man down, broke the
scoring drought. Furman later added an insurance goal to
seal the 2-0 victory.

Slagle noted that the team played hard in the match, but.
was gililty of too many unforced errors. The simple things,
such as passing and trapping, were not properly executed.
Slagle felt that lack of concentration was a major problem
in the contest.

Tuesday Belmont Abbey came to town and handed the
Cats their worst loss in several years.

The visitors got the first goal with about twenty-two
minutes to go in the half. The dam then broke, as four more
scores were added to give Bemont
Abbey a commanding 5-0

- Davidson faced some tough competition and played
some close games, but they came up short Friday night,
losing to East Carolina (15-11, 16-14, 15-13).

On Saturday the Wildcats played a strong team from
UNC-Wilmington who played together in the USVBA last
winter. Although the score was 15-4, 15-10, 15-8 in favor
of the Seahawks, Coach Rebecca Hawkins felt that her
squad had held tough against a powerful opponent.

Davidson closed out the tournament matches by taking
UNC-Asheville to five games, losing 15-8 in the fifth.
Leading the ‘Cats were Maria Douglas, Michelle Plauche,
and Holt Hathaway.

halftime advantage.

In the second half some order
was restored, as Belmont .was
held to only one goal while the
Cats got scores from Friedlander
and Peter Cobb.

The 6-2 final was most disap-
pointing, as this was a contest the
Cats had expected, and needed, to
win.

The season is still young, and
the team has played a difficult

practice, hoping to prevent their opponents from jumping
out to an early lead. In previous matches, the ‘Cats have
started out behind and have been forced to play catch-up,
largely due to a lack of confidence.

The Davidson varsity volleyball program is still young
and has not yet established a winning tradition. But,
according to Hawkins, “this team is much better than last
year’s, and we hope to continue improving.”

The Wildcats will play this weekend at the ECU tourna-
mentin Greenville. They will then play Gardner-Webb on
Tuesday and will return home Thursday to take on Coastal
Carolina at 7:00 in Johnston Gym.
