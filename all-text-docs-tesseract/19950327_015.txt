The women’s lacrosse team
faced three tough matches this
week, dropping two but beating
Longwood Saturday on Parent’s
Day.

WOMEN'S

LACROSSE

The Wildcats lost 9-5 Tues-

day against Roanoke. But fresh-
man Katie Nelson said, “The score
does not reflect how well we played
in the game.”

Davidson next fell 15-4 to
Bucknell on Wednesday. But the
squad finished the week on a good
note with their first victory of the
season against Longwood.

After the game, the team and
families celebrated the win with a
tailgate party.

The team’s record now stands
at 1-6. The Wildcats next game is
at Richmond Saturday.

Men’s lax loses
tough game

Ashorthanded men’s lacrosse
team suffered a tough 3-2 defeat
Sunday afternoon at home, losing
when Appalachian State scored
with about 30 seconds left in the
game.

MEN'S

LACROSSE

The Wildcats (0-2) played
with just 10 players in the first half,
which didn’t allow them any sub-
stitutions. When Jeff Scherer
pulled muscles in his shoulder, the
squad was forced to play a man

down for the entire second half.

The biggest losses included
starters Cart deBrux and Will
Chung. Sean O’Neill;husband of
Classics Professor Jeanne O’ Neill,
has been playing with the team
much of the spring and helped pick
up some of the slack.

Scherer and Anthony
Mackaronis scored in the first pe-
riod and Davidson held a 2-1 lead
at halftime. But the Mountaineers
came back and tied the game, then
won on it off a good play on the
fastbreak.

The Wildcats had a chance to
tie it again but missed a shot with
10 seconds left..

Sarah Hogan leads women’s charge.

Fishing in the calm of a
_ rushing river

By JoHN RoE
Sports columnist

As I walked along the bluff on
my farm in Montgomery County
in Tennessee, I looked down only
to see the raging, muddy, over-
flowing Red River.

I kept on walking, my tackle
box and fishing pole in hand, hop-
ing I might come upon a calm spot
to fish. It was a warm afternoon in
early March, and I knew the fish
‘would be hungry. But with the
conditions of the river, it wasn’t
likely that I would catch a spare
tire — much less a fish.

I finally came upon a small
feeder creek where I often fish in
the summer, but I had never had
much success in early spring. Nev-
ertheless, I walked to the shore-
line, tied on a floating Rapala and
casted to the adjacent bank.

I started to retrieve the lure
across the middle of the creek when
BANG, a fish hit it. After a re-
spectable fight, I had a one-and-a-
half pound largemouth bass in my
hands.

This was the first of about 30

largemouth and striped bass I
caught that afternoon. Because of
the river’s flooded conditions, the
fish had moved up into the calm
creeks where they could feed with-
out using too much energy.

Also, because the creek was
shallower than the river, it warmed
much more quickly in the sun. The
majority of the fish I caught were
suspended in the back-water area
of the creek, where the muddy
water meets with the clear water.

This situation brings food right
to the fish’s nose, kind of like room
service. Now you tell me, if you
were a hungry fish, where would
you rather be — in the swift mov-
ing river or in the creek?

All of these factors contrib-

“uted to the full stringer of fish I

carried home that night. On a day
that did not look promising, I acci-
dentally stumbled into a great fish-
ing situation.

Now that I know the condi-
tions that caused that exciting
spring afternoon of fishing, the next
time I fill a stringer of bass in that
creek, it will not be by accident.

Whenever you havea success-

ful day on the water or in the field,
note the conditions and try to fig-
ure out what contributed to your
success.

Learning from successful or
unsuccessful outings will help you
plan your trip for the nexttime, and

_you will spend much more of your
time actually catching fish than
cursing the weather or your rod
and reel.

Although this particular trip

was in Tennessee, the same condi-
tions and fishing tactics can be

used on rivers in North Carolina.

The only thing you have to do is be
observant and try out that fishing
hole you have been waiting to fish
all winter.
