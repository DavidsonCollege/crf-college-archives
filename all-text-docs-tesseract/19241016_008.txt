Among the books which have recently been
jadded to the Library are the following: |
Seven Ages—By A Gentleman With a Duster. |

In his new book, the author of The Mir-
‘rors of Downing Street traces the main cur-

jrent of human thought from the age of
| Socrates down to the present time. The
book is written with great simplicity. The

author's purpose is.to help the plain man to
junderstand how it is he holds his opinions, |
to trace, as it were, the pedigree of his ideas,
to dig down to the roots of his thoughts.
Heirs Apparent—By Philip Gibbs.

The story all begins over the innocent mis-
jhap of pulling a crystal chandelier from its
moorings. Whereupon the two guilty ones
were expelled from Oxford, and set out to
walk to London with no thought of the con-
sequences. Here is a story of youngsters
‘born just too late for active participation in
the Great War but profoundly affected by
jits aftermath, conscious’ and critical
{themselves and the world they live in,
spite of their surface indifference.
Croatai—By Mary Johnston.

story about that band of English settlers

J. P. WILLIAMS DISCUSSES
VALUES OF AN EDUCATION |
TO THE MINISTERIAL BAND |

In addressing the Ministerial Band at
its regular meeting last Sunday after-
noon, Mr. J. P. Williams, general secre-
tary of the Y. M. C. A, spoke on the}
True Values of an Education. Mr. Wil-.
liams said that it would be foolish to
try to reatize what the true values really
are because they are so numerous and so|
varied but by putting first things first |
and using Christ as an example one could !
approach nearer to finding. what they
are than in any other way. Much stress
was laid upon the physical, as well as
the mental and moral side of an educa-
tion. He said that a good physique is as
much of a true education as the grades
that one earns. Men don't realize the
effect on society they have by going out
in its midst with a strong body as well as |
a well-developed mind.

}

In discussing the true values in con-
tact with fellowmen, three relationships
were brought out. . First, the personal;
second, the people around; and lastly,
those outside of personal relationship.
“Friendship,” Mr. Williams said, “can be
easily scarred by some hasty word or

education. ~ Cultivate

and
ihrough life.”

The last part of the talk was an ap-
to get aside and think things
through for oneself. Most men do very
little original thinking, preferring to let
the other fellow it for them. The
test of an education lies in looking at
things with an inquiring mind, for an
mquiring mind certainly thinking.
The final point was the value of putting
first things first.
