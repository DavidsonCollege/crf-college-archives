Amram diversifies 900 Room music.

Spring Frolics night activities will
begin this Thursday at 9:30, when
David Amram will present a_perfor-
mance of his style of music. Amram is a
musician who is, to put it mildly, quite
unique.

A native of Philadelphia, Amram
studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of
Music and the Manhattan School of
Music. He has written a great deal of
film music, and was the first composer
in residence with the New York
Philharmonic. He has also guest con-
ducted some of the world’s major
symphonies.

In 1977, Amram went to Havana
with Jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Stan
Getz, and Earl ‘‘Fatha’’ Hines. This
was the first time that American
musicians had performed in Cuba since
1961.

This man is definitely a multifaceted
personality. Attempting to break down
the walls between categories of music,
Amram utilizes Latin music, African
music, American Indian, jazz forms,
traditional music, and folk music from
around the world.

He likewise plays the instruments
of all of these various types of music;
guitar, piano, recorder; many kinds of

native flutes from many countries;
xylophone, dumbek, and drums. He
-was also the first to utilize French Horn
as a jazz instrument.

One of his favorite techniques—one
might say it is his trademark—is his
playing of two small flutes simulta-
neously.

This man has an aura, one of
communication, of really being at home
with the music. The State Department
has utilized this gift to send him to
Central America to study native music,
and he has just returned from a similar
trip to the Middle East.

Such a gift of communication and
absorption must come out in a perfor-
mance. One must not go to an Amram
concert and expect to sit back and
listen to the music. Amram involves
the audience, making them partici-
pants of what goes on. He believes that
music is a universal element that
should be shared.

Just as folk music is a community
event, so should a performance of
Amram’s interpretations involve ever-
yone. Amram will dance around the
room, leading the audience in clapping
their hands and tapping their feet:

Yet, he believes in total involvement
of music. He recalls hearing a Stokom-

ski Children’s. Concert at age 6, and

what an impression it had on him.
Sometimes when he gives a concert, he
will bring in local people who know =

regional traditional music.

Folk music is played because people
love it. It has shown proof of its own
validity. Both jazz and classical music
have their roots in folk music; Amram
uses this historical fact as a take-off
point for his own works. However, his
pieces are dynamic utilizations of an
entire spectrum of folk music.

Can his style of music be described?
It is, and yet is not, “folk,” “jazz,” and

so forth. He utilizes too great a cross
section of numerous cultures to be
pinned down. This is reflected by the

incredibly diverse use of instruments .

involved, also reflecting, no doubt, the
composer’s own incredibly wide range
of musical experiences, as well as his
own diversability.

It must be stressed that his music is
not a ‘‘performance,’’ but an “‘involve-
ment.’’ The audience is not to only
hear, but to participate and also be
spoken to. (Amram utilizes Indian
medicine songs that supposedly will
make one feel healthy.)

If we pigeonhole his music into any

sort of classification at all, let. it be
“Amram.”

DAVID AMRAM, a diverse musician of
many talents, will appear in the 900
Room for Spring Frolics.

Students find curiosity and friendship in Spain

Editor’s note: This is the first in a
series of open letters to the .campus
from Meredith Durden '80, who is in
Spain this term. Other Davidson
students in Spain this term are junior
Kevin White, sophomores Bill Coward,
Belle Erdman, Eugene Heath, Beth
‘Milano, Tom Phillips, Jim Prappa,
Ann Tutwiler, freshmen Robert Freir-
son and Helen White. The group’s
resident advisor is Professor of Spanish
Lois Kemp.

The conversation Belle Erdman and
I had on a street in Valencia was
typical. A Spanish girl asked what time
it was. Belle answered with three

Spanish words. The girl’s eyes lit up.
“You are a North American?”’ she
asked.

Her friends gathered around and
began firing questions. Where did we

we seen Starsky and Hutch in person?
What did our boyfriend look like? Had
we ever met Robert Redford?

The girls’ questions reflect the
prevailing attitude of Spaniards to-
wards Americans. It is not animosity,

but curiosity. We are used to being
stared at and talked to; at first we took
it personally. But as one of the Spanish
girls travelling with us pointed out, a
lot of the people here are isolated. Few
of the Spaniards we’ve met have ever
been to the States and few plan to go.
It is understandable, then, that the
sight of fourteen Americans with
bright backpacks turns a lot of heads.

We are travelling around Spain by
train for two weeks... We climbed a
mountain up to a modern art museum
in Cuenca and explored the palace and
gardens of the Alhambra in Granada.

composition for plucked instruments.
Vivaldi, himself, may have provided a
valuable key. In publication, a quartet
of sonnets with one for each correspon-
ding concerto was attached. They
provide a guide to the imagery within
the piece, to which the plucking adds a
new dimension. The thunderstorms,
birds and other illusions created by the
kotos are extraordinary.

The above is a brief description of
one variance of the classical tradition,
namely, giving original scores a new
flavor. Still another began in the early
1900’s which was playing relatively
new music in an old style. TRe Early
Music Consort of London has recently
recorded an album which does just this.

Intent on reviving the ‘‘Golden Age’”’
of English music, they have recorded
pieces whose dates of composition
‘range over a 400-year period. The
“Golden Age’’ ran from Elizabethan
times through the seventeenth century.
The recorder was a predominant instru-
ment, and so the recording is enhanced
by only an occasional harpsichord or

In Valencia we pushed our way through
the crowded ‘‘Fallas’” festival by day
and slept: in a huge seminary at night.

For three days we were mystified by
the Holy Week processions in Sevilla.
Ornate floats in honor of the Virgin are
carried alongside men wearing what
appears to be Ku Klux Klan robes. The
men, often barefoot, carry heavy
crosses and lighted torches for miles to
show their piety. In cordoba we gaped
at the Great Mosque and then visited
an ancient palace that had served as a
prison for the Inquisition for three
hundred and thirty one years.

After another week of travelling we
will return to Madrid. There most of us
will live with a family for twe months.

Many of their pieces have been

transcribed for the recorder.
Contemporary composers, Edmund

Rubbra, Peter Warlock and Clive
Richardson are well represented. Rich-

large amount of music for radio and
films. ‘‘Beachcomber”’ was originally

The eating habits, for example, begin
with coffee and hard bread in the
morning and end with a three course
meal at midnight. In between there are
lots of snacks, usually eaten at bars.

A ‘‘bar’’ to a Spaniard is a lot
different than the American conception
of a bar. Spanish bars are everywhere
amd are always attended. Most of
these bars have chairs and tables
outside, too. fn the afternoons people
sit and sip and watch other people pass
by. We have been watched for weeks.

Eugene Heath was in a crowded bar
and needed a knife. He urgently
flagged down the waiter and loudly
said, ‘‘Una cuchilla, por favor."’ As the
waiter nodded and hurried off, Eugene
leaned over and whispered, ‘‘I hope
that means a knife.’’

Japanese musicians discover new Vivaldi

The two recordings mentioned are
only a part of WDAV’s collection of
‘new classical’ music. Frances Wilson,
the Classical Programmer for the
station, welcomes any request for
music and extends an invitation to
anyone to visit WDAV in the after-
noon. Frances is quite familiar with the
albums along this line, which are
constantly coming to the station, and
is willing to answer possible questions.
