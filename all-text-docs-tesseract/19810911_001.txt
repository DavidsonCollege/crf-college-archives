Endowment crashes 99.99 percent

Davidson’s Endowment has
fallen from approximately $23
million to $127.13.

College President Samuel
Spencer said the college lost
$22.5 million on Confederate
war bonds purchased in April
by College Archivist Chalmers ==
Davidson. Another $49,000 is
missing in English Professor
Gill Holland’s office.

Spencer said he had given
Davidson control of the money
because Davidson ‘‘told me he
knew about a little bitty cheap
stock that was going to get
bigger quick. It sounded like a
good deal to me.”

Davidson defended the bond
purchase, saying, “‘it’s still a
good cause.”’

The paper bonds are worth
about $27.13 as collecter’s
items.

Spencer said ‘‘I hate to say
this, but Chalmers did a dumb
thing.”’

Spencer said he gave English
Professor Gil Holland $49,900
cash in late April ‘‘to keep it in
his office where inflation
wouldn’t get it.”’ :

me clean a place off for you to
sit over there so I can look for
it.”

Holland is still looking.

Spencer said he gave them to
Holland because ‘‘nobody even
goes up on the third floor next
to a couple of sociology pro-
fessors.”’

A task force of library work-
ers is being organized to search
Holland’s office.

Task force leader Weezie
Mann said the group will search
for the money in German Pro-
fessor Julius Winkler’s office as
well.

“We can’t let them be messy
just because they drink to-
gether every afternoon at the
Anchor Tavern,”’ she explained.

Spencer denied the loss would
prevent construction of the
proposed athletic complex.

Spencer added, ‘‘if things are

Pres. Spencer censors non-lvy League films

President Samuel Spencer in-

when he prohibited the showing
of Ball State University grad-

American Scribbles. The issue
arose once again in 1970, when
the administration blocked the
showing of Woody Goody’s

Herrin said he was ‘‘disap-

of the most influential films he
had ever seen, The Under-

a Jersey City State graduate.

Union Director Shaw Smith,

policy ‘‘does not keep people

When College President Sam-
uel Spencer came to Davidson
in 1968, the faculty was all
white and middle-aged. Spencer
said at the time that he wanted
to change all that.

Today, largely because of
Spencer’s leadership, younger
professors in their 20’s and 30's
make up about 40% of the
faculty.

. But no minor professors have
been hired as yet. Only two

The Trustees recently ap-
proved a new tactic in the
search for minor professors
when they passed Spencer’s
proposal to seek and hite
minors, regardless of their eth-

only white minors from Meck-

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann said

In this era of shrinking endowments, niggardly
alumni, and drafty dormitories, small colleges will have

long-term revitalization program which he called ‘The
Ultimate Weapon.’

Davidson’s College Bowl program experienced
yet another contortion yesterday when Head
Coach Hansford Epes unexpectedly resigned.
Epes, who had held his position for almost a year,
announced his resignation during the 10 o’clock
hour before a somber crowd in the Snack Bar.

Epes declined to comment on the reason for his
resignation. It appears, however, that the courtly
facade of the Davidson College Bowl program has
been concealing a not-so-rosy state of affairs.
Indeed, the program could be called a festering
mess. Sources say Epes’ resignation followed
accusations of mishandling players, situations,
and assistant coaches.

Two disgruntled team members, Bob ‘‘Twit”’
Evans and Edward ‘‘Ed”’ Trumbull, approached
College President Samuel Spencer last Wednes-
day to air their grievances.

“They were obviously at the point of nausea,”’

Spencer told the Devoidsonian yesterday, ‘‘Bob
told me he’d had it up to here, and if something
wasn’t done about it he was going back to

(Georgia) Tech to be an engineer. So, I asked .

Hans (Epes) to resign.”

‘However, the players’ complaints had nothing
to do with the resignation,’’ Spencer added.

But what had Evans, the 5 foot 5 inch, 10 inch
cerebral diameter (CD) starter, in such a
tizzy?

“I’m a star, the-star of the team,” Evans said,
“T mean, my IQ’s 330 and I’m Social Chairman of
MENSA. I'm hot stuff. I wanna go professional.
Epes knew this, and he kept getting in my way.
He bad-mouthed me all over the Union—tried to
ruin my chances. I’m great, I make this team, but’
he wouldn’t let me do my stuff.”’

Evans was not the only disgruntled College
