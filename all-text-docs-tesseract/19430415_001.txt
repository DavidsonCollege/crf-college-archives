case last year on account of the

“It is hoped,” said Mr. Payne, “that
many alumni will find it possible
to return to the college at least
for this one day. We believe, as
indicated last year by our splen-
did attendance, that a large num-
ber of our friends and former
graduates who could not be ab-
sent from their business and, in
many cases, from War work for
the duration of the customary
commencement period, will be able
to spend at least Saturday, May
29, on the campus.

Baccalaureate
The baccalaureate sermon will
be preached on Sunday morning,
May 30, by the Rev. P. D. Miller,
D.D., pastor of the First Presby-
terian Church, San Antonio, Texas.
Until recently Dr. Miller was pas-

tor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Raleigh, N. C. and was
intimately related to the affairs

of the Synod of North Carolina.
He was also a member of the Board
of Trustees of Davidson College.
An alumnus of Davidson of the
class of 1922, Dr. Miller is a broth-
er of Dr. O. L. Miller, eminent bone
specialist of Charlotte, N. C.

It would be rank heresay to say

that the representatives from
Queens and Salem this week-end
especially the blind dates, were at
all attractive. But we, being in an
heretical and blesphemous state of
mind, are prepared to make that
unhallowed* statement. Entirely
adverse to the deep-rooted tradi-
tion of the wretched martyrdom of
on-campus functions, we can safe-
ly say that the occasion of late
was most enjoyable.

Spring

Contrary to week-end precedent,
Saturday was a_ glorious day.
Spring was in the air, the earth-
worms began to turn, and Rumple
creaked childishly in the . April
sunshine. Evidently all was right
with the world. The only blot upon
this idyllic scene was a frumpish,
glowering group of thwarted
“flushees’” who huddled malevol-
ently at the threshold of the Y,
brooding over their appalling fate,
and making nasty cracks at the
blissful couples who slithered down
the walk toward the athletic field.
Rejoicing and gaiety, though,
were the order of the day, and all
_gloom was obscured in the ensuing
festivities. The track meet with
VPI was the first on the after-
-noon’s program, and the effects
upon the fairer members of the
spectators were something for a
psychologist’s notebook. Complete-

ly deranged emotionally, the girls
simultaneously babbled in delight
and shrieked in dismay, irregard-
less of Who won. what. Of course
it was all unintentionally, and
their apparent ignorance regard-
ing loyalty to the right team was
quickly excused.

Basketball Game

Following the meet a basketball
game was staged between the Dav-
idson Intramural All-Stars and the
Air Corps Cadets Champeens. The
game greatly enjoyed by
everyone but the players, who
found the down-court blocking on
both sides a mite bit too rough.
After the brawl in the gym, the
guests and escorts retired to the
stadium for supper. Needless to
say, the food was excellent, even
with Taylor and Hobbie making a
spectacle of themselves by consum-
ing voraciously everything in sight.

Three Plays
But the keynote of the whole af-
fair was struck with the three-
way drama presented by the three
schools. Salem led off on the boards

was

with a lachrymose, woeful bur-
lesque entitled “Diamonds or
Roses,” starring Barbara Humbert,

as Talliaferro Truelove, the hero,
and Joyce Wooten as the damsel
in the foul clutches of a viper. The
audience survived long enough to
endure an even more woebegone
tragedy “The Mean Queens Dean,”
which laborousl?~ portrayed the
carefree life of Queen College. As
an anticlimax, Bill Lyman’s “Look
What Liquor Done, Gra’maw” was
presented, the Georgia Theater
Guild outdooing itself in an ex-
tremely moral morality play. This
dejected melodrama had to do with
one Fanny, her incurably oiled

father, and an assorted group of
