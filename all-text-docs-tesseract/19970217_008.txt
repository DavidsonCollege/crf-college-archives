OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1997 .

Dr. Ortmayer, one of my fa-
vorite professors, stresses that your
thesis should always be at the be-
ginning of a paper and very easy to
find. So here it is: Martin Luther
King Jr. was one of the most re-
markable men in the history of this
nation. Here comes the develop-
ment: the fundamental reason why
I say this is because, in my opinion,
King was one of the few men in the
history of the world to truly follow
the teachings of Jesus Christ. Yup,
there’s areligious side to this article
as well. But it’s not going to be a
fundamentalist tirade. My final
point: as a society, we have strayed
from several of Dr. King’s teach-
ings, and that is one of the funda-
mental reasons for the rise of racial
tensions in this country.

As most educated people know
(whether they are Christian or not),
Jesus taught to love your neighbor
and to turn the other cheek. Christ
was the Prince of Peace because
that was how He taught us to re-
solve all conflicts. Jesus taught that
we should live lives of love and
forgiveness for our fellow man (and
woman). As most educated people
also know, the Church has not ex-
actly been perfect in following the
man whom it claims was God. Just
read about the Inquisition or Cru-
sades if you have any questions
about this point.

The reason the Church has
strayed is quite simply because it is
very difficult to follow the example
of Christ. It is much easier to lash

out in revenge than it is to forgive.
What made Martin Luther King so
exceptional was that he was strong
enough to follow Christ’s example,
‘even in the face of the racist society
in which he lived. And when you
look at it, that is also what made him
so successful.

The best way to beat racism is
to make it come out into the open.
King’s leadership left no loopholes
or instances for racists to point to

to heart. He began a non-violent
protest movement that taught to turn
the other cheek. Protesters quietly
sat and let themselves be beaten by
police and sprayed with fire hoses
in sub-freezing weather so that their
message would be heard.

It was. White people through-
out the country saw blacks peace-
fully sitting and refusing to fight
back against their oppressors.
People saw the courage of the pro-
testers. But what was most impor-
tant was that it became very clear
who was in the right. When the
protesters did not fight back, the
police had no excuse for the beat-
ings. And when the protesters filed

ones. The reason that the civil rights
movement succeeded was because
it crossed racial boundaries. De-
segregation and real equality of
rights (if not of opportunity) would
not have happened if whites, who
had a monopoly on power; had not
recognized the validity of Dr. King’s
message. King’s tactics were the
reason so many whites who had
previously been against, or at least
impartial to, equality between races
changed their colors (so to speak).

Sadly, the teachings of the man
who had the greatest impact on race
relations in this country have gone
largely overlooked in recent years.
This is not to say that they have

made racial
slurs against Jews. Furthermore, he
strongly supports and defends the
government of one of the few na-
tions remaining in the world with a
thriving slave trade, the Sudan.
Farrakhan and his supporters
preach a philosophy that stands in
total opposition to the one King
followed. They want power and
revenge. They encourage segrega-
tion of the races and for blacks to
trust only blacks. They organize
racists events like Black Monday
(after all, what else would you call
an event that boycotts businesses of
people simply because of the color
of their skin). And they brand those
who stand against them as traitors

to their race.

What was Dr. King’s dream?
It was not revenge or separatism,
but rather that his kids would be
able to play with white children
and that neither would see the other
as different. After all, why should
skin color distinguish people any
more than hair or eye color does?
We cannot have it both ways. We
cannot emphasize our differences
at the same time as we expect people
not to notice them. We should
follow the example of Dr. King and
look beyond color and see each
other as people, not as races.

As asociety, we need to return.
to the teachings of Martin Luther
King Jr. And this time, whites
should take the initiative and learn
to love their neighbors and to turn
the other cheek.

We even need to love and for-
give the Farrakhans of this world.
And we need to refuse to give in to
anger and not to lash out at things
we feel are reverse racism.

No one benefits from racism,
no matter what form it takes. If
things are ever going to get better,
people of all races need to trust
their fellow human beings. Dr.
King did that by working within
the system and trusting that Ameri-
cans of all races would see beyond
the color of a person’s skin if they
were given the chance.

I pray that America can follow
Dr. King’s dream. Maybe one day
he’ll look down from heaven and
see that it has come true.

A Different Look at America

I have read with interest the
articles written on these pages about
the experiences of those in other
countries. As one who has left
America only once and had a brief
taste of a different culture, tales
from places I have only seen in
pictures are fascinating.

Like others at Davidson, last
semester I studied in England for
three months. However, this article
is not about England

through the check-out line, offering
to help customers with questions,
or checking to make sure that water
glasses were full on the table. Clerks
at supermarkets simply rang up to-
tals—there was usually no effort at
“apurchased smile” or a friendly
“have a nice day” when leaving.
Transactions were polite and busi-
nesslike, yet the whole concept of
service, of being waited upon when

huge lines (queues) for bus service,
andelectronic gadgets are not nearly
as plentiful. I wondered how some

Americans would react to such situ- .

ations.

Another thing that struck me
after being in England is the relative
provinciality of Americans. While
half of the news section of a British
paper is devoted to news outside of
Britain, it is fortunate if the Char-
lotte Observer

prints two pages or
a few short articles
on world news. Per-
haps this is a prod-

first time was this: be-
ing abroad taught me as much about
Americaas about England. Ithought
more about American assumptions
and values from a distance than I
had ever done before. Even in an
English-speaking, first-world, in-
dustrialized nation whose colonies
eventually formed the United States,
American attitudes stood in stark
relief in many ways.

I never realized the premium
Americans place on friendly, atten-
tive service until I experienced En-
glish grocery stores and restaurants.
Often, the only difference between
the employees and the customers
was that the employees happened to
work there. There was generally
little effort at making pleasantries

entering, was almost non-existent
at times.

I also came to appreciate how
dependent we are on conveniences.
In Britain there are only four televi-
sion channels, the telephone is ex-
tremely expensive to use, movies
are often a year behind American
theaters, supermarkets are notnearly
as well-stocked, and a car larger
than a Honda Civic is a luxury.
Necessities of economy and En-
glish ideas about what one needs to
live comfortably are radically dif-
ferent from America. There is sim-
ply not the same emphasis on per-
sonal convenience.

For example, stores are not
open nearly as long, there are often

uct of our geogra-
phy; after all, Americans cannot

travel in 300 miles in any direction —

and be confronted with a myriad of
languages, as many Europeans do.
Perhaps it is because America is the
only superpower remaining that
many Americans do not feel the
need to worry about what is hap-
pening in the rest of the world.
Regardless, when I returned to the
States I was immediately aware of
the contrast in global awareness.

People often say that travel
broadens one’s mind, and I would
have to agree. I learned not only
about Britain and about myself, but
I discovered that perhaps the best
way to learn about America is to
leave it for a while.
