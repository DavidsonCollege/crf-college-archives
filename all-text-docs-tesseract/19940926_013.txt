of the season, the men’s soccer
team has found a rhythm. The 6-2
Wildcats streaked to 3-0 in the
Southern Conference with a 2-1
victory over the Appalachian State
Mountaineers last friday night in
Boone, NC.

“That was a big win for us,
especially with for our conference
standing,” said goelkeeper Alex
Deegan. ‘

The victory avenged a bitter
loss last season and sets up a big
match tommorrow against the
Furman Paladins in Greenville, SC.
Davidson will take an impressive
4-1 road record for their biggest
conference game of the year. The
winner will most likely win the
regular season title along with the

#1 seed for the conference tourna-
ment in November.

The previous Sunday the
Wildcats shutout Marshall 3-0 de-

Andrews who will still be out an-

Cats succomb to big plays; esis . Scale wins 34- 3

By Matt Pitzer

The men’s football team Sat-
urday again fell victim to big plays,
much as they did the week before,
and lost to Emory & Henry 34-7 in
the Homecoming game.

A week ago, the Wildcats fell
victim to Maryville, Tenn., because

of three long scoring drives, but.

basically outplayed their opponent.

Saturday, however, the Wasps
took advantage of the big plays to
take a 21-7 halftime lead and then
grinded out the game in the second
half, racking up some big num-
bers.

Bruce Bannister was one of
the offensive highlights for the
Wildcats, picking up 49 yards on
18 carries. Quarterback Kevin
Holzworth looked impressive at
times, completing 13 of 24 passes
for 161 yards. ©

But Emory & Henry managed
to gain 250 yards on the ground
and 226 yards through the air. Most
of those came on acouple first-half
big plays and in the second half,

when the Wasps were trying to run
off time.
The Wasps scored the first

touchdown in the first quarterona

third-down, 58-yard pass from
quarterback Jason Strange to Aaron
Fuller. .Fuller made a medium-
length reception, but found him-
self behind most of the secondary
and scampered in for the score.
Davidson, however, bounced
right back and drove 69 yards on

nine plays to tie game. Bruce Ban- -
nister capped the drive with a 3-.

yard plunge off to the left side. On
the possession, the Cats were able
to mix up both rushing and passing
plays to march down the field.

' In the second quarter, the
Wasps scored on a 38-yard drive,
of which 34 yards came onasingle
pass play.

Just before halftime, though,
Davidson was hurt again by the big
play. Strange found Fuller wide
open again, this time down the left
sideline. Fuller had made several
shorter receptions on both that and

Fuller scored on another re-
ception in the second half. Charles

Cole rushed for the Wasps’ other
two touchdowns.

Sailing takes third in first North Points Regatta at Clemson

This fall’s first North Points
regatta was hosted by Clemson
University. In a 0-3 knot breeze,
Clemson jumped to an early lead
with wo first place finishes in A
division.

Davidson was a solid third
with two third place finishes. But
in the first set of B division races,
Davidson answered with two first
places totake the lead as Clemson’s
B division flustered.

When racing resumed after a
break, the wind was still ight, and
the committee switched from atwo-
race rotation to a one-race rotation.
Davidson scored another third, and
Clemson won again to pull within
one point of Davidson. When the
B division went back out for the
third race, Davidson’s B again an-

swered Clemson’s A with another ’

first.
Clemson, still not getting it
together in B fell to five points

behind Davidson. In the final race
of the day, both Clemson and
Davidson’s A divisions started
aggressively, and both were over
the starting line early. After re-
turning to the line. to restart,
Davidson and Clemson were in

seventh and eight places overall.
Fighting back through the fleet,
Davidson ended up fourth, with
Clemson third. Each had a com-
manding lead in one fleet, but when
the points were totaled, Davidson’s
consistency paid off as they won

by four points. Clemson claimed
second place, followed by Citadel,
College of Charleston, Savannah
College of Art and Design, UNC
Wilmington, NC State, and Duke.

Sailing for Davidson this
weekend were Lara Onkey, An-

drew Cole, Graham Ernst, and Thu
Thieu. The sailing team races at
home next weekend for the second
North Points Regatta of the sea-
son. The racing will run from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Lake Campus.

our alumni through our newslet-
ter,” says Andrew. “This race also
allows the alumni to associate with
our current team members.”

The race is purposely held on .

Homecoming weekend in aneffort
to attract the most participants. The
participants started and ended on
the hockey field. The men ran an
8K race consisting of the short as
well as the long cross country loop.
The men started out at 8:45 am.
Eight team members and thirteen
alumni participated. The first run-
ners began coming in around 9:13.
The pack was led by Josh Cookson
‘98 and following him were Erik

McMichael ‘95 and John Moss
‘91. Other classes represented by
the men were ‘63, ‘67, ‘68, ‘75,
“84, ‘92, and ‘93.

Upon the finish of the last
male runner at approximately 9:35,
the women began their 5k race

The rain that.began to fall as the.
