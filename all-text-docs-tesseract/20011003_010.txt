The Davidson’s women’s volleyball team
continued its past domination of opponents
UNC-Greensboro and Wofford this past
week, but ran into a roadblock against South-
ern Conference leader Georgia Southern.

The Wildcats (6-7, 3-3) defeated the UNCG
Spartans at home, 28-30, 30-27, 30-24, 22-
30, 15-12. It was the Cats’ tenth straight win
over UNCG.

In the hard-fought, five-game battle, jun-
ior middle blocker Roberta Quis led the team
with a double-double of 16 kills and 12 digs.
Sophomore outside hitter Latisha Chapman
provided 13 powefful kills while classmate
Nicole Tonelli, setter, impressed fans once
again with 44 assists.

After Chapman put the match away witha
blistering spike, assistant coach Amber Grahn
remarked, “I’m proud of the way we pulled
together as a team at the end of the match.”

Indeed, the Wildcats fought to sustain mo-
mentum the entire game. After losing the
first game, the Wildcats were down 27-26,
when two consecutive aces from junior
Kaitlyn Martin saved the game.

After dropping the fourth game, Davidson
worked through seven ties in the fifth. Three
straight points off of Tonelli’s serve pro-
pelled the ’Cats to victory.

Two days after the triumph over UNCG,
the Wildcats traveled to Spartanburg, S.C. to
take on Wofford, against whom Davidson
now boasts a 13-1 all-time record.

The Wildcats won the match in 4 games, —

30-20, 30-26, 27-30, 30-25.
Coach Tami Darwin commented,
“Wofford is a strong team this year, and we

knew not to take them lightly.”

Darwin was also pleased with that, for the
first time in seven matches, her team won
match’s fourth game. Leading 29-25 in the
fourth game, senior Jacqueline Ortega put the
game and match away with her team-high
21st kill.

In addition to her 22 digs, Tonelli distrib-
uted 39 assists to her teammates. As a team,
the ’Cats registered 10 blocks.

On Saturday, the team faced its toughest
opponent yet, Georgia Southern.

Jim Davidson complimented the blue liners,
“Any night that we limit the other team to less.
than twenty shots we are going to win the
game. We don’t really trust our goalie, so the
fewer the shots the better. I was impressed
with our defensive performance.”

out of the next three, the squad is guaranteed
