THE DAVIDSONIAN

A LOOK AT...
By Bill Godwin

The Real McCoy—Or Is It?

THE NEWS is out by now. Davidson fullback Graham
Allison has transferred to Haavaad. And all along I

HOWCUM they played a soccer game tonight be-
tween halves at the Davidson-Catawba opener? Truth of
the matter is, they needed something for entertainment,
found the band a little scimpy in numbers for marching,

decided Charlotte could stand a bit of soccer for a change. |

Soccer man Joe Kelly (a Charlottean) suggested it to
Coach Marrotte, who leaped at the idea.

Campaign

Who said a team’s best
defense is a good offense?

We're not sure but we
know it wasn’t Coach Bill
Dole. More accurate with
him would be to say a
team’s best offense is a good
defense.

Finally, this year, the big “D”

thing—Defense.

PARKER HIMSELF looks quite the part of a Golden
Greek these days, sporting a deep-set suntan.

DAVIDSON'S soccer team is awaiting the ar-
rival of a German lad who participated in the Rome
Olympics. An exchange student, he was one of 300 Ger-
man youths sent by his government to watch the interna-
tional tussle—not to kick. Incidentally, Davidson's
foreign student total is unusually high this year—16.

BERT KAMM, a Wildcat harrier, is Argentinian by
birth but German by blood. His Jewish parents fled the
Hitler purges in 1938, three years before Bert came

along.

THE SOUTHERN Conference has a fulltime commis-
sioner for the first time since 1953. He’s Lloyd P. Jordan
and his office is in Richmond.

He Likes Davidson Better

A DAVIDSON freshman footballer, Benny Coxton of
Raven, Va., turned down a $50,000 bonus from the Pitts-
burgh Pirates to come here. Duke also tried to get him.
“He’s ready for the varsity right now,” says Dole.

CATAWBA PLAYED two freshmen in_ its starting
line-up last weekend—to no avail. Western Carolina clob-
bered the Indians 35-0, outrushed them 259 yards to 86.

LOOK FOR a big, coaching change to be announced in
January. Involves a name well-known in these parts.

Eckbert Out?

on September 30.

That dark cloud emerges with
the the possibility that Bill Eck-
bert, who paced the 1959 team
and ran third in the conference
meet, may be forced to trans-
fer from Davidson. This blow
to the Wildcats, who graduated
only two men from a 1959 team
that won 9 while losing only 2,
will certainly be felt.

Coach Heath Whittle lost
Larry McNeill and Charley
Bridges by graduation, while
Mac Brownlee and Bill Cof-
fey are not returning to Da-
vidson this year.

The loss of Eckbert would
leave Captain Bob Thompson,
Dave Gilmour, and Tom Mar-
tin as the principal returnees
from last year. Gilmour placed
ninth in the conference meet
last year and was consistently
among the top runners in Da-
vidson’s meets.

Coach Whittle is also count-
‘ing heavily on aid from those

from the split-T, but that's)
about all that remains the same.

Offensively, the Wildcats will
run and not pass. This was
shown when Dole moved Dan-|
ny House, leading Southern!
