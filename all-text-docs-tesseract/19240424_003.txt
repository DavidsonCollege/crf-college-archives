Extract from a Freshman’s letter home:

“x x x x x—lI've been eating at the Trough
lately. The other day we got tired of eating
food that was a cross between fish and de-
lirium tremens, and asked for a menu, so
we'd sort of know what to expect, like a
forecast of bad weather.

“So the next day we had a menu for sup-
per. First, there was a jellied boullion,
which looked all right in print, but tasted
like something that had defeated the cat, but
had been killed in the struggle. Hopkins
said he liked his soup hot enough to steri-
lize his mustache. But jellied boullion was

The mornings will be consumed with
\classes, conferences on student problems, ap-
plicable to students on their. own campuses.
| During the afternoons recreation and rest
‘will be allowed the delegates, and in the
|evenings outdoor service will be held and
‘lectures given on student problems.

Blue Ridge is situated 20 miles from

“Dapper Dan” Keels—"Foree of habit.”

Bill—"There goes Mabel.”
Will—"T think a lot of her.”
Bill—"I_ know—a lot you shouldn't.”

Mother—‘‘Are you entertaining a young
man today ?”

Daughter—"No, mother, I just met him
today,”

“Where are you going in such a hurry?”
“Nowhere.”

“Then what's your hurry?”

“T gotta ‘get there.”

Some girls aren't really bad, they're just

At the close of the first week of the Ugly
Man’s Contest we take pleasure in announc-
ing that “Chick” McCrary is leading the field
with 97 votes. Irving Johnson and Nappy |

votes each, and Dick McMillan is a close |
third with 67. |

known at Blue Ridge, girls from Southern |
Colleges, serve as waitresses in the beautiful |
dining halls. The dining halls are also en- |
livened by the pep that prevails within the |
halls. College delegations vie with each |
other in college yells and songs, and the |
waitresses will also be given yells by their
respective tables.

There will be intercollegiate matches in|

swimming, tennis, baseball, basketball and |
| wrestling, Hikes and other forms of out-
|door exercise will also be enjoyed by the |
| delegates. Davidson hopes to have at the |
| conference strong teams in these sports, and
| will be a strong contender for honors along |
{athletic lines.

! Another feature of the conference is the
| Stunt Night event, when each of: the college
| delegations stage an original stunt. ,

University of North Carolina, Georgia
Tech, Mississippi A. & M., Washington and
Lee, and Davidson are among the schools
which have the Jargest delegations at Blue
Ridge. Davidson's delegation this year is
unlimited,

Those who have attended conferences at
Blue Ridge report that the inspiration re-|
ceived at these conferences is hard to get
elsewhere. The fact that the conferences are
smaller_than-such-as the recent Indianapolis |
Conference affords a spirit which cannot be
found in larger conferences. |

AW students interested in “attending the |
conference may obtain further particulars |
from Mr. Williams, at the “Y” office, or |
from members of the “Y"” Cabinet.

LIBRARY NEWS

During the past few weeks six valuable
‘books on widely different subjects have been

purchased and placed in the Library.

In-

|cluded in the list is The Life of Woodrow:
| Wilson, by Josephus Daniels, the former Sec- |

played for the verdict of history.”

The other books are Richmond, Its People |
and Its Story, by Mary Newton Stanard, a}
book containing 83 illustrations; The Bible,
Its Origin, Its Significance and Its Abiding
Worth, by Arthur S. Peake, professor at}
Bible in the University of Manchester. The |
Methodist Review, criticising it, says: “It is |
a fair and exhaustive treatment of all issues |
involved. The preacher has here just the |
kind of material which will enable him to}
help people who have difficult questions |
which must be answered for the strengthen- |
ing of faith.” This is the sixth edition of |
the book. |

Also The Highway, by Caroline Atwater |
Mason; The New Capitalism, by S. A. Bal- |
dus, and the Cause and Character of Ue
