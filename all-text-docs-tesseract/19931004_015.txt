The Davidson football team
took a short road trip for a big road
victory behind senior quarterback
Richard Howell’s three rushing
touchdowns and two big blocked
punts by the special teams. This
victory. was Davidson’s first at
Guilford in over 11 years and
brought the team’s record to .500
for the second time this season.
The Cats upped their-series record
dominance to 18-6-1 with an im-
pressive victory. Davidson bit
early, opening a 14-0 lead in the
first quarter on two 1 yard runs by
Howell. The second touchdown
was set up by a big special teams
play when sophomore Bo
Bartholomew gangbusted through
the Quaker line for his first career
blocked punt. Though he is the
quarterback, Howell is an effec-

tive runner as well, gathering 60
yards on 22 carries. He picked up
his other rushing touchdown late
in the second quarter on a 7 yard
trot for his third touchdown of the
day.

Though Howell did the scor-
ing, junior Bruce Bannister did the
running, rolling up 117 yardson 20

carries to lead Davidson on the~™

day. Behind .the three rushing
touchdowns by Howell, Davidson
took a 21-11 lead into halftime.
The only scoring in the third quar-
ter.came behind another big spe-
cial teams play. Following the
second blocked punt of the day by
the Cats, Mike Warrick picked up
the loose ball for a 25 yard return
and a touchdown for a 28-11 lead.
The score would be all that the
Cats would need. Uncharacteristi-
cally, the defense allowed the

Guilford squad to run at will, giv-
ing up 356 yards on 54 carries for
the day. This total almost equalled
what Davidson has given up all
year long.

After a Guilford touchdown,
the Cats answered with a fifth
touchdown, when Howell con-
nected with senior Kelly Shirley
for a three yard touchdown pass in
the fourth quarter to put the game
away. Shirley ended up as the
leading receiver with 3 catches for
79 yards, Howell ended up with
impressive stats again through the
air, completing 10 of 18 passes for
168 yards with one interception
and one touchdown. For the day,
Howell was involved in 63% of the
Wildcat’s offense. The Cats will
next travel to Washington & Lee
this weekend and will then face
Methodist here.

Sniffing around the kitty litter for tidbits

By Robert Lloyd-Still

eIt’s that time of year again
when the fair- weather Atlanta
Braves fans come out of the wood-
work. Here they are wearing their
brand new t-shirts and Braves caps
which still aren’t broken in. They
allclaimto have been watching the
Braves on TBS when Bob Horner
played third and Chief Nakahoma
cheered from his teepee in
centerfield. In reality, they’vebeen

- fans for three seasons and a season

tothemis the NLCS and the World
Series.

°We are really upset with the
situation at the lake campus. As
freshmen we never payed five dol-
lars an hour to take out the sail-
boats. We understand a five dollar
fee on gas if waterskiing, but pay-
ing to sail is ridiculous. The sail-
boats. are already payed for. We
would like to see the policy re-
versed. And why aren’t the facili-
ties ever open under their supposed
hours?

¢Where the heck is intramural
street hockey? Wehadsome of our
fondest memories playing this sport
on the outdoor basketball courts. If

you see Rogers King, please con-
sole him because this was one of
the highlights of his life.

¢We have some problems with
the overtime system in flickerball.
As it presently stands, each team
has four plays in which to gain as
much yardage as possible. The
problem is that if the first team
loses yardage, then the second team
only has to down the ball four
times. Let’s implement a five
minute overtime or let the teams
see who can score first from the
