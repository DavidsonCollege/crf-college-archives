Students Excited
by Burning Field

Shortly after supper (the evening meal
at Davidson) on last Monday evening, a
red haze seemed to spread across the sky

over the buildings beyond the railroad
tracks. Immediately there began a reg-

ular barrage of alarms as calls of “fire’
went back and forth on the campus
(please do nat mistake this for “Fii-yo,”
as it has an entirely different pronuncia-
tion) and soon the fire apparatus, includ-
ing buckets, hose-carts, extinguishers and
non-coms, was making a rapid progress in
the direction of the (supposed) blaze.
The more skeptical of the student body,
remembering the disappointing alarm of
last fall, lingered behind, while the more
adventurous and daring souls rushed pell-
mell toward the excitement. The blaze

was mounting higher and higher; the
cloud of smoke, reflecting the flames be-
neath it, covered the city and. illumined
it as if it were brightest noon-day. Hoarse
calls of “hurry,
first,”

women and children

and “stand back” hastened the

The semester is now started and much
is to be done in the months to come. The
student body. will settle down to its rou-
tine once more, after the reaction to ex-
ams has passed. The time to make the
most of your work is now, when the new
work is just starting, and when there will

,| be much that is important i nthe studies

at hand. Make the most of your time,
and then with the course started off in
the right way, there will not be that fear-
fulness and shakiness that so often is
present when exam time rolls around
again. Plan now to be ready for them
when they do come once more, and they
will see much less fearful than- they
have before.
ESS OE
The Y service this week will be led by
Dr. Oren Moore, a Davidson alumnus, a
famous football player while here, and
one of the most prominent physicians in
the state. He has spoken here before,
and always has made inspiring and help-
ful talks. Don’t miss this service—it’ll be
one of the best of the year.

TRUSTEES MEET

According ‘to an announcement
-made here last week, the sub-com-
mittee appointed to consider the
fraternity-housing situation at Da-
vidson will report to a committee of
the board of trustees on Monday,
February 13:

The report will be made at a joint
meeting of the committees in Char-
lotte on that date.

ABDICATION

Student Government at the University
of Wisconsin is no more, The faculty has
accepted the self-deposed student senate’s
recommendation that its charter be con-
sidered defunct, and thereby has seconded
the opinion of student leaders that there
is no reason for maintaining an unim-
portant and unnecessary institution. Since
1916 the men’s student senate has been
the highest council in student affairs. In
October, the members voted to disband,
after deciding that their actual powers
were few and of little import. Self-gov-
ernment will be administered by five ad-
ministrative boards. Centralization will
be had by the union of the chairmen of
these five bodies in the supervision of stu-
dent elections. Otherwise, there will be
no central board of control.

The cobra is deaf to all sounds, its hear-
ing apparatus consisting of a delicate
membrane which receives only ground
vibrations. Indian charmers knowing
|this, tap the box or basket in which the |
reptile is kept, partly stunning the crea- |
ture by the force of the vibrations. It
jis thus rendered thractable so it can be

| handled.

| veloped a method of treating sawdust ye

| food for cattle and sheep.
