Men's Victories Over
VMI and Citadel Put
Team in Conference Race |

By Bruce Balestier

Entering an afternoon contest
with league foe Marshall yester-
day at Belk Arena, the Davidson
basketball team’s record stood at
6-7. Their 3-3 mark in Southern
Conference play, boosted by con-
secutive home wins over VMI and
The Citadel, had earned them fifth
place in the league standings
through Saturday’s action. What
follows is a review of the games
which have taken place since
Christmas Break began.

Clemson 93

Davidson 77

December 21 in Clemson,
S.C., the Tigers broke open aclose
game late in the first half with
pressure defense. Clemson took a
40-29 halftime lead and coasted in
behind athletic forward Devin Gray
(20 points). Despite some tum-
overs against the Clemson press,
Wildcat freshman walk-on point
guard Chris Alpert, in just his sec-
ond start, turnedina poised perfor-
mance (eight points, six rebounds,
four assists). Janko Narat_ led
Davidson (3-1) with 16 points.

Wake Forest 71

Davidson 52

In the first game of the Coca
Cola Classic doubleheader at Char-
lotte Coliseum December 28,
Davidson held future NBA Lot-
tery pick Rodney Rogers of Wake
to just 10 points and fouled him
out, butnever recovered froma 14-
2 Deacon run that started the game.
Jason Zimmerman’s steal and
three-point play midway through
the second half drew the ‘Cats
within 49-39, but three straight dry
possessions after that sealed their
fate. Zimmerman had 13 points.
UNC-Charlotte 95
Davidson DT hase
After taking a6-3 leadon three
hoops by center Detlef Musch,
Davidson simply fell apart against
the 49ers January 3 at the Coli-
seum. The Wildcats shot 30.6%
for the game, and the UNCC lead
grew and grew and grew. Even
49er coach Jeff Mullins admitted
that the game was an aberration.
“They’re better than that, and we
know that the next time we play
[February 10 at Davidson] they’ ll
be a different team,” he said.

By Pete Hurtado

The women’s track and field
team began its winter campaign
with strong efforts from the entire
squad, including two new school
records at the Lynchburg Invita-
tional and the Comfort Inn Invita-
tional at Virginia Tech. “The
women are performing great, es-
pecially for this early in the sea-
son,” claimedcoach Beth Manson.

Sophomore Elizabeth Bishop
led the Wildcats with a school
record performance of 18:42.3 in
the 5000m, placing second. Bishop
also recorded an outstanding
3000m time of 11:21.8.

The 4x100m relay squad of
Maria Whitehead, Sarah Orsbon,
Heather Tarpley, and Helisse
Hoffman posted a school-record
time of 57.55 at Lynchburg, plac-
ing fourth.

Sophomore Carolyn Mead-
ows clocked an impressive 3000m
time of 11:13.2, more than 10 sec-
onds faster than her previous best.

Sophomre Maria Whitehead

jump (13' 5") and the triple jump.

(33' 7"). Whitehead also had the

fastest 400m time on the team at
66.3.

Senior captain Heather
Tarpley ran an impressive 500m

Wrestling Places 4th
in Home Tournament

By Steve Krause

Davidson wrestling can be
characterized as both young and
restless. While starting seven fresh-
men and three sophomores, the
Wildcats have shown steady im-
provement with each match and
they enthusiastically perservere
into the future.

Last weekend, Davidson
hosted a five-way dual meet with
Pensacola, The Citadel, Longwood
and Carson Newman. The Wild-
cats finished fourth but showed
improvement from previous
matches. The Wildcat victory was
a 45-9 trouncing of Pensacola.
Davidson received excellent per-
formances from Bo Bartholomew,
Miller Cary and Jared Glick.

Against Carson Newman and
The Citadel, coach Tom Oddocited
inexperience for the losses. “We're
a very young team,” he said. “We
were beaten by inexperience and
size. Their wrestlers in the higher
weight classes were bigger, more
mature and were able to control the
matches.”

However, against Longwood,
Davidson was beaten in the last
matchup and lost 30-22. Oddo
called the defeat “‘a good indica-
tion of the development of our
team.” In December, Davidson
wrestled Longwood and lost 9 of
10 matches.

Oddo singles out perfor-
mances such as freshman Jason
Deaton’s as examples of
Davidson’s rapid improvement.
“Jason lost to the Longwood kid in
December in his first dual match.
Last weekend, he absolutely con-
trolled the match neth och hata ie

or ee

Oddo said.

A luxury which Coach Oddo
enjoys is the enthusiastic attitude
of his wrestlers. “I find as tough
competition as possible,” he said.
“Our wrestlers understand the only
way they’ll improve is to get as
much mat time as possible. For
example, freshman Miller Cary is
willing to wrestle anyone who will
step on to the mat with him in any
weight class.”

The Davidson wrestling team
is excited about its future. With
each match, the Wildcats continue
togain experience and maturity. In
store for the remainder of the sea-
son are three more tournaments, a
variety of dual matches, and an
anticipated rematch with
Longwood. This weekend, the
Wildcats were at Washington and
Lee for a tournament with such
teams as VMI, W&L, Longwood,
Washington and Jefferson, John

Roos’ Buzzer-
Beating

Shot Tops
Winthrop

By Chris Hood

Jennifer Roos couldn’t have
picked a better time to hit her first
three-pointer of the season.

Davidson called time out with
six seconds remaining «Saturday
evening and Winthrop’s Revonda
Whitley heading to the line fortwo
attempts. She made the second to
give the Eagles a62-61 advantage,
only their second lead of the con-
test.

“Coach Filar worked some-
thing up during the time out, but
wedidn’trunit,” the senior grinned.
“Iwas going to push it up and dish
off to a wing, butI didn’t sce them,
and I saw the clock.”

Roos’ shot rattled around be-
fore falling through the hoop as
time expired, sparking hysterics
among mostofthecrowd. Anelated
Davidson team and a stunned
Winthrop club looked to the
scoreboard, which read 64-62, with
no time remaining. The victory
raised Davidson’s record to 5-8.

“They dida fantastic job down
the stretch,” Davidson head coach
John Filar said after the game. “I
couldn’t have asked them to have
done better.” .

Though the “Cats Iead nearly
the entire match, rebounds nearly
cost them the victory. Winthrop
eameda 53-25 bulge onthe boards,
constantly outmuscling the home
team.

As has been the case through-
out the season, freshmen domi-
nated nearly every statistical cat-
egory for Davidson. Erin Butcher
continued her offensive assault;
racking up 28 points. Without
Kristen Ferrucci, Lisa Lyons and
Katrina O’Neal, all out with inju-
ries, Davidson has found its go-to
force in Butcher.
