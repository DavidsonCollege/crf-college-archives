. Thanx.

At the suggestion of Harry Elliott a
list of the points to the jokes in this col-
umn will be found at another place in
the paper.

You Said It!
The Seniors, at any rate, have some-
thing to be thankful for this fall.

What Shall it Be?

As December 1st draws nigh so does
Christmas. But what we started out to
say was that it was high time for the
Seniors to start scratching their heads
in an effort to induce those ornaments
to produce subjects for their Theses. To
prevent such characters as*Dave Rob-
erts from scratching out all the hair
which remains on their spinat-chord
stabilizers we submit the following sub-
jects by way of suggestion. Of course
any other subject which nobody knows
anything about will do as well.

A New View of the Obvious.

Infinity Brought to Light.

Slang—Ain't It Awful?

Table Manners on Mars.

syllable).

Erratum. a

Jim Boulware requests us to make a
correction—a thing which we are always
pleased to do. Jim says that it is Louis
Schenck, pres. of the Y. M. C. A. and
not he, who has the defective eyesight.
The Peanut Parcher regrets deeply the
occurrence of this most lamentable er-
ror.

This Week's Bone.

Bobbie Long tells the law class that
Annette Kellerman is blind, deaf and
dumb. Our heart goes out in sympathy
to Annette in her affliction.

A Ballad of Every-Day Things.
By J. W. C.

I want to go home, the student ‘said,
I want to go home to “her.”

My spirit pines for her sweet voice
Of tend’rest devotion dear.

You durst not go, his room-mate said,
You durst not leave this place

To wander fair fields o’er with her
And set her heart a-pace.

For you've no buttons on your clothes;
Your socks are torn and stained.

Down at the laundry the deed was done,
Done, forsooth, in high disdain.

Has’t leave been granted you, my boy
. By your grandad's only son?
Tf not, ‘tis no use to think of her

For here you stay anon.

In sorrow the student agreed
To all that had been said.

His wandering mind to earth he brought
And thought of beans and bread.

FOOTBALL STAR GIVES
LATEST DOPE ON GAME

Montague Clarke Picke C. M. Clark for
All-Southern Honors.

In an interview with a prominent busi-
ness man on the train en route to Pine-
hurst for the Scrub-Freshman game,
young Clark gave out the following
startling information: The Davidson
second team is really composed of bet-
ter players than the varsity. In fact it
generally comes out ahead in all con-
tests between the two teams. However
the varsity players were here and play-
ed last year and for the sake of senti-
ment they are allowed to play again this
year. Possibly they will all graduate in
time for the Scrubs to show their real
ability, however, and it is hoped that
Mr. Clark will then be able to mect
some players of his own caliber and
meke a name for himself.

The star guard went on to explain
that the Scrubs would not think of low-
ering itself by playing a freshmen team
were it not for the financial remunera-
tions expected.

The Davidsonian reporter was on the
job as usual, and it is through his good
work that the paper is able to print this
inside information.

Caution.
The Peanut Parcher has had its life
insured and we now sing the refrain to
“Hail, Hail, the gang’s all here.”

Why Not?
When everything else on the Hill has

had a collection taken up in its honor,

we wonder if some altruistic gentleman
couldn't start raising a fund for the
Davidsonian staff. «

Our Philosophy.
‘Tis better to have loved and lost,
Than win—and evermore be bossed;
And he who never loved a one,
Has far more sense than Solomon.

Hew! Haw!

Martin Foil says he takes the Concord
paper so he can read the weather re-
port today and see what the weather
was going to be yesterday.

A Natural Man.
A wee girl strolled across our Campus,
With all her might she tried to lampus,
But we were too wise
To flop for her eyes,
So she gave up all hope for to vampus.

The Barrack Boulevard was not meant
for wet weather—let alone Davidson
rains.

Sam Brady hasn’t anything to say this
week.

Sam Story said——but we can't repeat
it here.

Sounde Like Him.

J. E. Cassell—I say you are pretty dar-
ling.

She—But you would say I pretty
whether you thought so or not.

J. E—And I know that you would
know you were pretty whether I told you
or not.

He's Not So Far Wrong After All.
Sam Burgess (writing to girl)—“
yes, it rains up here nine days in every
week.”

An Ounce of Prevention is Worth a
Pound of Cure.
(We'll say it happened in 1929.)

A. P. Ormand was visiting in the home
of his old friend John Gaston. Mrs. Gas-
ton had left the room, but it seems that
her spirit remained after her.

A. P—And I say John old man, were
you all nerves when you proposed to
your wife?

J. G—No, I wasn't, but if I could have
foreseen the future I should have been.

Fresh 28; Seniors 25.

In a close but rather slow game Wed-
nesday night the Freshmen defeated the
Seniors. The game was marked through-
out by the close guarding of both teams.
Although in the main the game was list-
lessly played, the players at times show-
ed flashes of real form.

One of these periods came in the clos-
ing moments of play. With the count
24-14 against them, the Seniors staged a
rally that threatened to pull the game
out of the fire. In the last five minutes
the Seniors shot five field goals and a
foyl, while the Fresh were able to cage
only two field goals. But the whistle
blew with the Fresh three points in the
Icad. In the last encounter between
these two quintettes the game ended in
a tie. In the play-off the Fresh won by
one point.

The work of Ormond, A. P., at for-
ward, and Johnson were the redeeming
features of the Seniors’ play. McCon-
nel and Palmer were the high point get-
ters for the Fresh, each getting eight

points. Line-up:

Sophs 33; Seniors 2.
In a hard fought game, marred by

many fouls on both sides, the Sophs de-
feated the Seniors 33-24. In the first half
the passing of both team was off form,
and that together with close guarding,
kept the score down. This half ended
g to § in the Sophs’ favor.

Ormond, A. P., showed up best for the
Seniors. Besides making 10 points he
played a beautiful floor game. Six of
his points were due to his uncanny abil-
ity to cage free shots. He shot five
straight, and after missing one by a
hair’s breath, he rang up another.

For the Sophs the shooting of Brake
and Mauze featured. Mauze played a
consistent game throughout and collect-
ed 10 points. Brake, who entered the
game at the beginning of the second
half, led his team in scoring by making
The work of McLaurin at
guard must not be overlooked. Time and
again he broke up the Seniors’ passes
and sent the ball flying down the floor.
Crawford played his usual splendid floor
game.

The game was hard fought, but was
delayed by the numerous fouls. The
Sophs made seven and the Seniors six.

The line-up follows:

Juniors 30; Fresh 13.

The Junior five won the last game of
the series on’ Monday night, winning
once more the class championship in
basketball. In the first half, the game
was fast and hard fought on both sides.
The period ended with the tally 14 to 9
in favor of the Juniors. In the second
half, the vanquished Freshmen seemed
unable to work together. They still
fought gamely though vainly and they
