Last Number of Junior Program

Last Thursday night the Piedmont Ly-

of the season in Shearer Hall, The Frazer
Duo appeared in a snappy and: varied pro-
gram of character sketches, dialogues, and
music. ‘Ten’ standard characters were pre-
sented in an able and entertaining manner.

The Swedish sketch was particularly good,

‘as was the sailor dialogue, which included a

was the most

gram. Mr. Frazer, with his rapid costume
changes and large fund of jokes, never al-
lowed the interest to flag. Tis baritone

solos were good, and his yodeling occupied
entirely too small a place on the program
Mrs. Frazer's accordion solos, particularly
the medly of Trish airs and the popular
songs, were thoroughly enjoyed.

The number was undoubtedly one of the

best of the season, and above the level of

at Davidson. keen humor

Dr. Gillespie To
Speak to Students

Dr. Richard T. Gillespie, class of ’04,
will be the speaker at the “Y” services
Sunday evening. Dr. Gillespie is presi-
dent of the “The Columbia Theological
Seminary. The Seminary is now mov-
ing to Decatur, Ga., where it is putting
on a large building program. Since this
move to its new home Dr. Gillespie has
been instrumental in the greater part of
the work and will probably make_ the
seminary one of the largest in the south!
by the opening which will come in the
fall of 1927.

Dr. Gillespie has just completed con-
ducting a series of services at the First
Presbyterian Church, of Atlanta, Ga., of
which Dr. J. S. Lyons is pastor. These
services followed a week of services held
by Dr. Harry I. Vance, noted
of Nashville.

Dr. Gillespie is well known among the
students of Davidson, having: visited us
last year, and all will welcome him back
He is a comparatively young |
man and his talks are especially devoted
to the men of college age. Dr. Gillespie's
coming to Davidson is considered a for-
tune and the “Y” is to be congratulated |
upon securing his return to the hill, Ev-
eryone who heard Dr. Gillespie last year
will not need an invitation to “Y” serv-
ives, but those men who have not had the
opportunity, will be on the right road if
they direct themselves to Shearer Hall on
Sunday evening.

Coach Younger Will Assist Tex
Tilson in Remaining Spring
Football Practice

Under the combined efforts of Coach
Monk Younger ‘and Coach Monk Mattox,
the varsity baseball team is gradually round-
ing into form, Coach Younger was with the
team last week for the first time and then
only for a day or two. Captain Alford was
still in charge and Coach Younger. told him
to go ahead and he would observe for a day
or two.

Evidently the coach was well impressed
with the way Coach-Captain Alford has been
putting his men through their paces, for he
made few criticisms. Several times during
the week the “possible varsity’ was sent
against a team of the scrubs for a tWwo or
three-inning game. Few good plays were
pulled while errors and “boners” were in
constant evidence.

Coach Younger has intimated that Coach
Mattox will have charge of the varsity for
the next two wecks, and probably longer.
During this time Coach Younger will be
working with Coach Tilson on the spring
football practice.

Coach Mattox should be able to coach base-
ball well. He plays minor league baseball in
the summer and knows the game. He plays
several positions and can no doubt greatly
assist Coach Younger with the team this
The team needs base runninginstruc-
tion, as well as fielding and hitting experi-
ence and it is too great a task for one man
to coach pitchers, catchers and fielders.

The same line-up is being used as was
given last week in this column with the ex-
ception of first base. Joe McConnell has
emerged as a kind of “dark horse” and is
working out pretty regularly at the initial
McConnell is a left-hand hitter and
was used some last year as a pinch hitter.
His greatest asset, however, is a cool and
steady head, a thing many of Davidson's
players needed last year to curb their excite-
ment and cagerness,

According to Captain Alford, the axe is
due to fall this week and the squad will be
cut down in order for the various men to
get more attention and practice.
