Ten days before classes began,
Patsy Ds ‘was approached by
Edmunds on the tennis courts
at Montreat, N.C. ‘White, Director of
Admissions, had heard Patsy, then a
rising junior at Kings College, dis-
cussing how she would like to transfer
out of the Tennessee college.

“‘White asked me if I’d thought
about transferring to Davidson,”

u Patsy said. Then she explained what

she felt like replying. ‘‘Sure, and I’ve
also thought about buying a Rolls
Royce.”

Patsy was admitted, granted finan-
cil aid, and placed into a work-study
position before she ever set foot on the
campus. Everything was done by
mail with the help of Mr. White.

said. “But I
had built it up in my mind to be a very
tough school, so I never applied. But
when I was given the chance to come,

Patsy knew it’ was going to be
tough, as after she was accepted she
got a letter comparing Davidson and
its workload with other colleges. ‘‘I
don’t know exactly who sent it, but it

Vassar and Dartmouth when it came
to workload. It told about the
all-night study room. Then it asked if
I was sure I wanted to come. ~~

Was she swallowed up by the
academics? Patsy’ answers, ‘‘I've
learned what its like to work hard
here. It was a big adjustment at first.
Sometimes I thought I was going to
pack up and leave. I was used to~
cutting corners at school, and you
just can’t do it here. For example I -
took some 21 courses, as I had heard
that they were the easy ones. But I
really had to work. The crib courses at
Davidson may be crib for somebody
like Einstein, but they weren’t crib for
me.” .

Patsy finds the academic ‘rigor
motivating. ‘‘I had no idea I could do
some of the things I’m doing. I’m
used to sort of resting on my laurels.
That was the situation at King—a big
fish in a little sea.’

King College has about 300 stu-
dents and several one man depart-
ments. Patsy knew she could get a
wider variety of courses here. When
pressed about why she went to King
originally, Patsy cites ‘‘political rea-
sons.” “But I honestly feel like after
you’ve gone here, you can go any-
where,” Patsy said. ‘‘These are the
years when you find out you have to
work.”

Nancy Northcott, a transfer stu-
dent from the University of Rich-
mond, also considers the social sys-
tem at Davidson better than the one
she came from. She describes Rich-
mond as a “suitcase college, and very
fraternity oriented. If you oe ond

pits.” She enjoys the casualness of
the Davidson frat system, the open
parties, and the frequent campus
movies. cet
Nancy talked about an initial
adjustment problem that most all
transfers to Davidson’mentioned.
“This is a clique oriented place. We.
transfers aren't intentionally ignored;
it’s just that people see us for the first
time and assume we're someone who

had bad ie all aise on that ey
_just never met. They assume we have
our own clique,”

Nancy is a pre-law student who
cites Davidson’s reputation as an
attraction to transfer.. But an impor-
tant factor in her transferring was the
disagreeable social situation at her
first college.

Bob Sherbecoe has been working
hard for three years, but he will work
another two before he graduates from
college. Bob transferred to Davidson
this year after three years at the
University of Southern California.
Davidson stipulates that a graduate
must attend for at least two
years.

“College should be more than just a
place where you go to classes,” said
Bob. As a pre-med student at USC,
he was disheartened by biology class
with 800 students. ‘‘You had to make
an appointment to see a teacher and
the appointments only lasted ten
minutes.”

Bob was ‘‘not encouraged’’ by the
pre-med committee at USC. “Their
purpose was to weed people out,” he
said. So he _talked to a school

school and mentioned Davidson.

Bob came as a pre-med student;
now he is certain that he wants a
health related career, but not: neces-
sarily the life of a doctor.

Bob responds to the small size of
Davidson as ‘‘it allows for more
interaction on all sides.”

Perry Bartelt is a pre-med transfer
who did not come to Davidson
because of its small size. ‘‘I’d like to
see this place get bigger,”’ said Perry.
_ Perry, now a hall counselor on third

shall in Pennsylvania for a year.
“There were constant feelings of

Perry was attracted by Davidson’s
good reputation. Franklin and: Mar-
shall also has an excellent reputation,
but Perry objected to the atmosphere
there. “If I had a question, I’d have
to ask about five people before I’d get
the right answer,’’ Perry said.

“But I never really thought about
transferring until I heard about
Davidson,’’ Perry said. “‘It was more
