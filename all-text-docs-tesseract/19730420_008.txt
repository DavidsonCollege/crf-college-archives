Netters Clip Apps 5-4. In Cluteh Match

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Playing with all the finese of a
clutch team, the Davidson ten-
nis squad captured a narrow 5-4
win over Appalachian Wed-
nesday to virtually assure the
Wildcats of the regular season
conference title for 1973.

“I thought we played very,
very well considering the ad-
verse conditions we had to
face,’ praised head coach Jeff
Frank.

Those conditions included
several new experiences for the
team this year. For instance,
they had to play under a dome
vecause of the rain which fell all

ay.

This took an extra drive to
reach the ‘Bubble’, as the
domed courts are called,
following the two-hour trip to
Boone. ‘

Secondly, the match did not
begin until 5:30 p.m., even
though it was scheduled to com-
mence at 2:00.

Adding even more pressure
was the element of not being
able to play but three matches
at a time, due to the lack of
court space. The Bubble has
only three courts.

Fourthly, the matches were
played on hard courts. The
Cat neeters are not at all used to
this type of composition, since
they play the vast majority of
their matches on clay courts.

Above and beyond all these
problems, the Mountaineers
had the team that many said
should beat Davidson for the
title this season.

Defying all these odds, the
Cats fought hard. It paid off as
they grabbed the victory.

Keith Richardson took the
win in the number one singles
position, defeating David
Weaver by a score of 6-0, 7-5.

Frank emphasized that he
thought Weaver would have had
a much better chance to win
had the match been outside and
on clay courts, which will be the
case during the conference
tournament next weekend at
Furman.

Rick Keller continued the
Mountaineer winning ways as
he stopped Kevin Menton in
three sets, 3-6. 64, 6-4.

The Cats swiped the ensuing
three singles matches begin-
ning with Bill Allen's win over
Roger Neely. It took Allen three
sets to finish the tough App net-
ter, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

Maarten Ruys took another
three set victory as he topped
David Rouse, 4-6,6-2, 6-2.

Hi Lankenau completed the
Cat string of wins with a 6-2, 6-2
smashing of David Richardson
in straight sets.

Don Eason defeated Rick
Quinby, 6-4, 7-6 to give the Apps
a tie at three-all going into the
doubles events.

In the opening doubles match,
Weaver and Ruys combined to
whip Richardson and Keller by
a tally of 6-2, 6-4. It was the first
loss this season for the Moun-
taineer number one doubles
team. Weaver and Ruys pushed
their season mark up to 16-1.

“I thought it was the best
doubles team we have met the
entire season except for UNC's
number one duo,’’ commented
the 28-year old Frank. ‘I was
especially pleased with this
win.” 7

The number three doubles
match was played next,
Davidson lost this one as Jim
Dorsett and Gary Bressler fell
to Nelly and Richardson. 6-4, 6-
4.

In the clutch match of the
evening, Allen and Menton took
a straight set victory over
Rouse and Eason, 7-5, 6-1 to

secure the win for the Cats.
Frank especially praised the
play of Allen and Lankenau in
the singles and the Weaver-
Ruys doubles combination.

‘I thought it would be a close
match when we left,’ said
Frank. ‘I think that we would
have a much better chance on
clay courts out-of-doors,
though.’ Davidson is looking
very good for the upcoming
tournament. \

Weaver should be one of the
top four seeds at the top
position, while Menton will be
either first or second at the
number two seed, if he wins his
match against William and
Mary.

Allen, Ruys and Lankenau
should all have the top seeds at
their spots. while Quinby will
prohably go in seeded third.

Weaver and Ruys will hold
number one doubles seed while
the Allen-Menton and Dorsett-
Bressler teams will be seeded
second at the number two and
three doubles slots, respec-
tively.

Davidson's baseball team is
in a dismal slump, and is
looking for a way out. The team
has lost its last seven games
and in the last four games have
been outscored 26-4 by their op-
ponents.

First year coach Jack Burris
is not exactly sure what is
causing this slump. His team

Willets Regains Form For Cats

By BOB WETZEL
Staff Writer
Athletes often have trouble
coming back from knee _ in-

juries. A change of position can:

also present problems for a.
sports performer. Senior Jack
Willits, the captain of
year's Davidson baseball

this -

these problems.

An all-star performer in high
school, Willits was an_all-
Southern Conference and _all-
North Carolina selection at
shortstop for the Cats during
his sophomore year.

However, last season his bat-
ting average dropped from .354

squad, has had to face both of to .283 and fielding errors en-

sued as Willits was hampered
by torn,knee cartilage. He still
managed to lead the Davidson
team in home runs for the
second consecutive year, but
overall it was a disappointing
season for a player who had
never previously hit below .300.

This season Willits is in cen-
ter field for the Cats and is hit-
ting a hefty 380 thus far. “I was
worried after last year,”’ he ad-
mitted. “I'd never played cen-
ter betore. but (George)
Weicker and (Bill) Todd (the
other Davidson outfielders)
have been a big help.”’

Willits noted that his tran-
sition has been made easier by
this year’s better team attitude.
“This is the most relaxed team
that I've played on at David-

’ gon,’ he commented.

Willits gives most of thecredit
for the squad's improved mon,
tai sue to first-year coach
Jack Burris and “his (7,
assistants.” Jim ‘assiter and
Maior * D. Allen. “We are
very fortunate to have three
men like them coaching,”’ he
noted.

Willits rates this edition of the
Davidson diamondmen as
potentially the strongest he's
seen here. “We're strong at
every position, and I think
we're coming closer to realizing
our potential than we've done
previously.” he stated. He ad-
ded that the Cats will be even
stronger if Ross Manire and
Marshall Case can overcome
the injury jinx.

Conference Chances Dimmed

As Diamonders Fall In Slump

seemed headed for one of
Davidson's best records when
the team was 8-2, but now the
record is at 8-9.

When asked about the team's
problem, Burris said ‘‘I can't
find out what is wrong, but I
wish I knew.”’

He indicated that the big
problem seemed to be the
team's inability to get hits when
men are on base. The team
seems to be ‘‘too tight’’ and
‘‘pressing’’ according to Burris.

East Carolina came to David-
son last Friday with a team
which has been nationally
ranked at times this season.
The first game showed E.C.U.'s
power as the Pirates ripped
through the Cats for a 12-0 vic-
tory. Joe Duncan pitched for the
Cats and had a rare bad game.

In the second game of the
twin-bill the Cats seemed
headed for a big upset as they
led 1-0 going into the fifth in-
ning. East Carolina with the aid
of one Davidson error was able
to pick up three runs in the fifth.

Freshman Joel Tew pitched
another good game for the Cats.
His pitching has bolstered the
team all year long.

The téam travelled to the
Citadel last Sunday for another
conference game against the
Citadel. The Bulldogs beat the
Cats 6-3, although starter
Dwight Plemmons went all the
way.

Gary Pomeroy was the hit-
ting star for the Cats as he ham-
mered a double and a triple.

In the final game last week
against Pfeiffer on Tuesday, the
Cats’ hitting failed them as they
were shutout 5-0.

Burris stated his hope that the
team can get back on track in
this week's games. ‘‘After one
win I hope the team can return
to the form they had achieved
earlier in the year,” he said.
