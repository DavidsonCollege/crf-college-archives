AAUP Looks At
Faculty Salaries

By JULE YOUNG
Stat Writer

Davidson's chapter of the
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors is an tn-
frequently mentioned group
on campus. Nevertheless. a
number of faculty members
are active members of the
association, an independent.
national organization of col-

lege teaching personnel.

According to local AAUP
vice-president Dr. Alan
Brinkley. the Dacidson chap-
ter is fairly active. ‘We've
had about five or six mect-
ings this year other than
business ones.” Brinkley
said.

He observed that in the
past the chapter had joined
professors at other institu-
tions in urging the repeal of
North Carolina's speaker ban
law.

“The chapter has endorsed
the effort to add several
black members to the facul-
ty, and we are working on
a possible proposal under.
which Davidson professors
would be placed on loan by
the college to black institu-
tions such as Johnson C.
Smith, with salaries paid by
Davidson in order to free the
black institutions to finance
more graduate study by their
professors,” Brinkley said.

The members of the local
chapter usually prefer to
work for their goals as indi-
viduals on commissions or
faculty committees rather
than as using the AAUP as
a group.

Brinkley speculated that
the group might atempt to
engage in collective recom.
mendations after the Spen-
cer commissions’ investigat-
ing tarious aspects of cam:
pus life release their find:
ings. The group may also ex-
amine the cath of Christian
belief required by Davidson’s
hiring policy, considering 1t

in tight of 9 1940 AAUP state-
ment eon academic freedora
at church-related institutions,
Brinkley said...

One of the important func.
tions of the chapter is the
gathering of data on faculty
salaries at Davidson. These
are submitted to the national
AAUP organization which
publishes reports on faculty
remuneration.

“These reports are very
important when the college
is trying to recruit top-notch
faculty personnel, particular:
ly since they have wide cir-
culation among many in the
teaching professions,"” said
Brinkley. “Unfortunately, we
have studies which show that
last year for the first time in
several years Davidson's fac-
ulty compensation did not
grow as fast as did the cost
of living. “But we show up
very well in the reports, as
Davidson's salaries are
among the highest for small,
non-public institutions."

The fact that salaries at
Davidson are relatively high
appears to be one reason for
a lack of more activity
among the AAUP. Most peo-
ple feel the situation here is
foudd, so the chapter has little
dissatisfaction with money
matters.”

cement, a somewhat
clumsey media, Mrs. Shew:
make abstracts the human
body. over-emphasizing the
minor parts while placing no
emphasis on the -more im-
portant areas of interest such
as the head. The result is an
unexpected freshness and in-
terest in the work.

_Mrs. Shewmake also em-
ploys relief sculpture in her
part of the show. In the
“Cocktail Party’’ and ‘’Con-
versation” she re-enforces
her broad planes and simple
lines with Egyptian figure
poses. The employment of
classic poses endows the
shapes with the rigid quali-
ties common to that period.

Some of her work can also
be interpreted as social com-
ment, such as “The Preach-
er’ and “The Doctor,”’ but
the final decision must be
left up Lo the viewer.

Mr. Shewmake is predom-
inately a painter. although
his better works are his
three etchings “Trees,”
“Wedding” and “Flowers.”
“Trees’ employs successfully
a man-made texture to cre-
ate a scene in nature. ‘‘Wed-
ding” carries the gloom and
pomposity of that infamous
institution, marriage.

Probably the best of all his
works in the show is “Flow-
ers.” This etching shows
Spirits of Spring coming
down to become flowers on
waiting stems. Many of Mr.
