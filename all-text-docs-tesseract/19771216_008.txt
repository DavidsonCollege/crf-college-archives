Nativity

It was Christmas Eve,

And raining.

Stockings hanging.

Limp.

Waiting to be filled.
Outside on a hill
Cars droned
In lonely exploration

Every object

Always waiting--

(Waiting now and evermore Amen)

There is no end to empty stockings;
Things filled
In the passion of amoment.
Ravaged.
Left limp.
And more threadbare
Than ever they were before.
Windshields and things wiped clean.
Spattered again with rain
And the blood of God

If
It were not for the grabbing
There would be no plastic manger.

Patsy Daniels

No Samsonite for Me, Please

The reason gators ‘hate suitcases
Ain't because they don’t go places.
