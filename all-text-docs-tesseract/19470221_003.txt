Westminster Fellowship Now
Discussing Religions

The Westminster Fellowship
Group is one of the newer religious
organizations on the campus, In
the fall of 19388 Dr. Joseph Garri-
son, an alumnus of Davidson, was
appointed director of Student Work
in the Presbyterian Church. When
he visited Davidson some months
later he held a conference with Dr.
Pritchett in regard to the organiza-
tion of some type of church spon-
sored group that would ten@ to
encourage the practice of attend-
ing Young Peoples meetings on the
part-of-these-whe-came—to-coHege
from churches that had such organi-
zations, and to introduce this type
of meeting to others. When all the
smoke of verbal controversy had

cleared, the present organization
was evolved.
The basis for the existence of

such a group is in the assumption
that the student of today has his
own ideas concerning religion and,
being true to human nature, would
like to express them, at the same
time sharing in the knowledge and
opinions of others. This then is
the purpose of the Westminster Fel-
lowship Group, to broaden—the-in-
dividual students perspective along
lines in which he is interested, and
to encourage him to share his own
ideas and experiences with his fel-
low students.
Discussions Frequent

The programs are arranged in
such a way as.to present a topic
on one Sunday and hold a discus-
sion on. the same subject the next
Week. For the first Sunday’s pro-
gram an attempt is made to present
a speaker who is somewhat of an
authority on the subject. He pre-
sents the subject as he sees it and
possibly some other opinions. Then
on the next Sunday one of the
students presents in brief the points
that the speaker has made and leads
the discussion.

The rich Christian fellowship and
worship is there for all students.
Although the group is sponsored by
the local Presbyterian Church, its
membership is not limited to mem-
bers of that denomination. ~The
meetings are held each Sunday eve-
ning at 6:30 in the. Quadrangle
Room of the Chambers Building. It
is hoped that every student will
feel that these are his meetings and
will become a part of them.

Other Religions

During the coming month the
Fellowship is taking up a series of
programs in the study of other re-
ligions. On next Sunday evening
Rev. Murphy Williams will present
a talk on the Seventh Day Advent-
ist religion and its practices. On
March 2, 1947, John Miller will
lead the discussion on this subject.

On March 9, 1947, Dr. K. J.
Foreman will speak to the group
on the Christian Science Religion,
bringing his wide experience and
knowledge on this subject. On the
following Sunday Buford Goodman
will lead the discussion.

Town. Observes
Day of Prayer

This evening at eight o’clock, the

‘Davidson community will gather

at the A. M. E. Zion “Methodist
Church to observe the “World Day
of Prayer.” During the service,
Charlie Elyea will present to the
Methodist congregation, jin behalf
of the College Sunday School class,
a pulpit Bible. The Bible was pur-
chased with funds acquired during
the first semester of this school
year.

Observance of the “World Day of

, Prayer,” which had its beginning

with the Protestant women organi-
zations .of this country: and the
world, has come to be a tradition.
On February 21, of each year, peo-
ples of every color and nationality
pause to offer their prayers of
thanks.

The Zion Methodist church~is
located across the railroad tracks
near the asbestos plant. “Its loca-
tion can be checked on the map in

Change Location

Last year the college Sunday
School class met at the Guest
House; but with the enlarged stu-
dent body of ’46-’47, it was thought
feasible to locate ourselves in Phi
Hall. This- location also became a
problem during the cold months
when there was no heat in the
building. After a long discussion
of whether to build a fire ourselves
or pay someone else; and, whether
to pay the high school for the use
of coal or furnish it ourselves, we
decided to move to the third floor
chambers.

Come over and see us!

the past several aveeks in
Tuesday morning chapel you have
been hearing’ an announcement
about some “Davidson Christian
Fellowship” and wondering to your-
self, “Well, what the world is
the Davidson Christian Fellow-
ship?”

Tteal began the spetre of pd
when several of the students were
wondering how would be pos-
sible to provide to the student body
a working plan for more zealous
and informal. Christian living, and
the result was the basic idea’ for
the Davidson Christian  Fellow-
ship. Feeling the power of defi-
nite prayer, sincere regular Bible
study and Christian “bull sessions,”
they laid plans. The idea was to
begin the Fall Term with a big rally
and to present to the students the
plan for daily Bible study, prayer
and “bull sessions’
rooms.

Rally Held
The Fall came, the rally was held,
and a great number
attended,

to begin immediately and to invite
those men in the reoms around
them to join them and then pray
for the Holy Spirit to work in their
lives. Immediately four daily hall
prayer meetings sprang up. There
was a spontaneous request for those
rallys to go on every Tuesday night,
and so they did.

With the Tuesday night mectings
went great suce Students and
outside speakers gave stirring mes-
sages. The “old time” hymns and
lively music were very popular.

spirit-filled meeting of this sort.

Dr. Cunningham Reports on
New York Meeting of
American Leaders

By David Hamilton
“Congratulations, Davidson, for

a job well done!” was the message
of Dr. Cunningham in Chapel last
week. “On January 21 of this year,
Mr. Henry Luce, editor of Time,
Life, and Fortune magazines, in-
vited a group of fifty men and
women representing various busi-
ness, professional, educational, and
religious groups to meet him in his
home in New York, and I had the
privilege of being present. The
meeting was called to outline pro-
posals for assisting the thirteen
Christian colleges of China. At this
meeting, the Y Gift-fund project
of Davidson College was cited as
a splendid example of what Amer-
ican colleges can do. I couldn’t help
At the Nash-
ville convention too, and at other
places, this contribution of David-
son has been very favorably men-
tioned. The final count on the Gift-
fund was $5,550.00.)

“As a result of Mr. Luce’s meet-
ing, an organization was formed
known as The Associated Boards
for Christian Colleges in China, and
Dr. Robert J, McMullen, former
president of Centre College, and
earlier one of the most prominent
of Presbyterian missionaries to
China and educators in China, has
been appointed the executive sec-
retary. This~organization is em-
barking on a broad program for
the rehabilitation of the Chinese
Christian colleges.
