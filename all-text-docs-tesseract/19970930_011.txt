Do you remember the story of the
blind man who tried to describe an
elephant?

He describes the trunk, legs, tail,
and ears, but he never describes the
elephant. In that sense, Danielle Howle
and The Tantrums are a musical el-
ephant and I am a blind man.

They invent music that exists at
the lunatic fringe of any true genre, so
I am forced to create my own —
FolkRockPost-PunkCountryT wang-
core. That is the best way to describe
Howle and the Tantrums’ sound be-
cause it flirts with each of these styles,
but never becomes comfortable in any
single one.

“Yeah, but what do they sound
like?”

Easy references can be made to
Joni Mitchell, Ani DiFranco, or any
number of female singer-songwriters,
but none of those comparisons accu-
rately describe Howle’s particular style.

Her songs slide effortlessly among
current genres. The songs tell stories
that pluck little bits of truth from ev-
eryday occurrences. Howle’s particu-
lar gift is that she glimpses into the
moments of our lives and sees the tiny
plum of truth.

“So it’s Danielle Howle and she’s
got this back-up band?”

Blasphemy.

Danielle and the Tantrums are a
unit, a crack-team of sound comman-
dos, specially trained in the art of rock

sings — and plays guitar, Troy Tague

We're back with another install-
ment of The Student Body!

We’ ve had a great week talking to
PE 101 classes about date rape, and we
really appreciate the warm reception
that we’ve received from both faculty
and students.

This week, the column is going to
deal with something that we all love:
FOOD! Some hall counselors and resi-
dent advisors have approached us about
their concerns for people on their halls
and their eating habits.

We're going to discuss both ex-
tremes — eating too much and eating
too little.

Overall good nutrition includes
both quality and quantity. Too often
people think of Coke and a microwave
pizza as a complete meal. While this
may’ provide them with enough sub-
stance, it is definitely not a healthy diet.

A well-balanced meal means go-

ing back to first grade and remembering
the four food groups: dairy, grain, meat,
and fruits and vegetables. A micro-
wave pizza does not have the protein
that an equal amount of lean meat would
contain.

Similarly, soda may provide the
energy that you are looking for to stay
awake in your next class, but it does not
have the nutritional value of carbohy-
drates.

While we know that society places
an emphasis on appearance and that the
“Freshman 15” is a formidable threat, it
is crucial that people find a balance
between calories burned and calories
consumed.

Exercising three or four times a
week is enough to regulate your me-
tabolism and stay fit. It is not necessary
to work out two or more times a day. In
fact, it is actually detrimental to work
the same muscle groups two consecu-
tive days.

People who work out regularly
should replenish their energy supply by
eating carbohydrates daily as well as
eating several servings of iron-rich food

me -

such as red meat or green vegetables.

Your body image and perception
of food is just as important as a healthy
diet. If you feel that you have a handle
on this whole issue, maybe you should
watch what you say around others — in
other words, use some tact and be sen-
sitive.

At Davidson, our conversations
are often focused around food. Moving
talk away from food and eating is one
easy way to help others who may be
struggling. & a

If you suspect you or someone you
know may have an eating disorder, we
urge you to talk to someone — a friend,
a roommate, a professor, one of us, a
person at the Student Health Center, or
someone else you trust.

We received a question concern-
ing healthy physical and psychological
sexual relationships on Davidson’ s cam-
pus. This is an issue we would like to
explore in the future.

If you have any comments con-
cerning this topic, or any other ques-
tions, please send them to: The Student

English seminar pulls all-nighter
Class sets new record in Ulysses reading

By HAWEE ROSE
Staff Writer

You may have been doing one of
several things on Friday night.

Going to some unknown destina-
tion, partying on the Court, ‘enjoying

the Charlotte music festival, or maybe
even studying — all viable options.
Whatever it was, you probably did

not know ‘that at 8:00 p.m. Professor
Kuzmanovich’s English Seminar on
James Joyce and Vladimir Nabokov
was carrying out an old Irish tradition.

The members of the class were
each taking turns reading aloud from
James Joyce’s Ulysses in the third floor
lounge of Martin Court F.

This entire process takes about 24
hours.

This year, the class broke the
Davidson record of 25 hours and 45
minutes, completing the reading at a
new record time of 24:50:40.

The seminar read from 8:00 p.m.
Friday night, well into the night and
early morning, finishing the next day.

Why did they do this?

Not only is it a College tradition,
but Kuzmanovich points to literary rea-
sons when explaining why he incorpo-
rated the practice into his seminar for
the seventh time.

The actions of the novel take place
in a 24-hour time period, and Joyce
intended for it to be read orally.

In general, the class members each
took turns reading chapters.

But when the text became more
difficult, each person would read a page
or so.

Joyce is known for his complex
syntax.

Most of the students read in an
American accent, but Vic Brand report-
edly read in an Irish accent.
