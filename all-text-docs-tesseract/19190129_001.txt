Lt. Morrison Wins D. 8. C. Twice.

Lieut. Julian K. Morrison, ex-'16.
of Statesville. N. C.. has been twice
awarded the Distinguished Service Cross
for bravery in action overseas, His name
and service appear in General Order
No, 24, General Headquarters ‘Tank
Corps, American Expeditionary Forces,
December 17, 1918, as follows:

“The  commander-in-chief of — the
American Expeditionary Forces. in the
name of the President, has. awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross to Lieut.
Julian K. Morrison, Tank Corps, No.
1903. for extraordinary heroism in’ ac-
tion in the Bois Quart de Reserve.
France, 12 September, 1918. Preceding
his tank on foot, Lieutenant Morrison
captured a machine gun nest. “Though
he was twice wounded, this officer con-
tinued in action for two days thereafter.”

The order also reads: “For extraor-
dinary heroism in action near Very,
France, 28 September, 1918, Lieutenant
Morrison is awarded a Bar to be worn
with the Distinguished Service Cross.
During the attack on Charpentry, and
Bois de Montrebeau, Lieutenant Morri-
son led a platoon of..five tanks, directing
his tank on foot s00 yards in advance
of the infantry under intense fire. Three
of his tanks were put out of action by
artillery fire, but he continued in action
with the remaining two until dark, when
he directed the work of rescuing the
crews,”

Lieutenant Morrison was the only
man in the Tank Corps to be awarded
the bar. or bronze oak leaf as it is some-
times called. Instead of being awarded
a second Service Cross, a bar is added to
the cross previously given. Lieutenant
Morrison is the second Davidson alum-
nus to win such a distinguished honor.

Captain McCoy, ex-'17, known on
the Davidson football field as “Butch.”
won the Croix de Guerre some time ago.
It is probable that other Davidson men
have won high distinction of whom The
Davidsonian has heard nothing. The
editor-in-chief and staff men will receive
gladly news of such instances, if there
be such.

Rev. C. B. Craig. ‘tt. has recently
been installed as pastor of the Presby-
terian Church at Laurinburg. N. C.

Around McAskill, last year's star

man, is due back in the near future, but
it is a question as ta what position he
will play.

It will be an.interesting fight for the
remaining positions. Davenport, a last
year's sub, is in mid-season form and will
bid. strong for -one of the forward posi-
tions. Dave Hall and Alexander seem
to be the choice of the remaining for-
ward candidates, but the dope may be
upset by Harrington, Denny or the Or-

Sophomores Champs.
Defeat Fast Seniors

Title Holders For Two Years Lose to
Second Year Men.

The Sophs win the the series. | In one
of the closest contested series ever held
on the hill the second year men won the
class basketball championship for 191g.

“Who's going ta win the champion
ship?” was the question that everyone
was asking last week. and there were
speculations from the Fresh team on up.
But no one really knew untel Ormand,
of the Sophs, shot a ficld yoal in the
extra session of the game Saturday
night.

Junior-Soph Game.

On "Tuesday night the third game of
the series was played between the Ju
niors and Sophs. This, hard fought
game was featured by the close guarding
of both teams. Jt was hard fought
thruout, and it was doubtful who would
be the winners until the timekeeper blew
his whistle. At the end of the first half
the Sophs were leading, but the Juniors
came into their own in the second period,
forging ahead in the last few minutes.
The leading feature of the game was
MecAlister’s guarding. Brice and Schenck
by their splendid guarding held the Ju-
nior's score down to ten. points, Final
score, 10-7, in favor of the Juniors,

Wanted For R QO. T. C.

Drilling May Start Soon For Militarists.

The biggest “crip” on the hill at pres-
ent may soon become our hardest ticket.
Vho the plans tor the R.O. ‘1.

C. are
progressing, slowly they are progressing
surely,

Capt. John W. Moore, an old Daiid-

son man, whe since his graduation has
been teaching at Winston-Salem, — has
heen asked by Dr. Miirtin to came and
be our Commanding Officer. He has
gladly consented and-has sent in his ap-
plication tf Washington, «to be trans-
ferred here, ‘Vhe last: word from Con-
gressman Webb is that they are working
hard to have him assigned to Davidson.

The povernment shows chat it is in
earnest, for it has appointed Mr. Jack-
son as the officer to attend to the gov-
croment yoo serty at Davidson College.

WAR GCLEPPINGS.
ARE CLA SiFEED

Miss Shaw has arcinged and tixed up
in the library a fle of pamphlets and
newspaper clippings on subjects relative
tothe war. “Vhese have been. classified
and put under different headings which
make it very easy to get almost any in-
formation of this particular kind desired.
The file tnchides ainong many others a
number of clippings on, the diplomatic
negotiations: preceding the war which are
as vet unclassified, the different phases of
the war itself. and) President Wilson's
trip te Murepe.

Phis file is valuable because most. of
the information would) otherwise have
heen destroyed te a short time and then
it would have heen necessary to. doa
great deal of restding before getting at
the facts. ‘Thanks to Miss Shaw's ef-
forts, such work is now simplilied and
shortened.

The January shipment of hanks for
the library has not arrived yet. | Chey
were shipped the first of the month but
owing to the congested traffic they have
not been delivered.
