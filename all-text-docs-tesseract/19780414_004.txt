Difficult weeks

The past two weeks have been difficult
for this newspaper. And more difficult
days may be ahead. It'is inappropriate to
comment fully in this space on the
proceedings involving The Davidsonian
until those proceedings are completed.
But it is equally inappropriate for the
senior staff of this newspaper to disregard
the proceedings as if they did not exist.

As a viable institution on this campus,
The Davidsonian demands high standards
from everyone associated with the Col-
fege: Likewise, you have the right to
demand those same standards from us.
We goofed and we’re sorry.

We ask no one to justify the recent
incident. This newspaper will not claim
special exemptions from the rules of
Davidson College. In fact, we claim to
have an extra burden placed upon us
because of our essential function: it is our
unique responsibility to focus attention
upon events that demand consideration by
the College community. And, sometimes,
that responsibility is not pleasant.

In January and February, charges of
“vindictive” and “dispicable” action were
levelled against the College administration
after a professor was dismissed. At a
recent faculty meeting, “intimidation” by
the administration was discussed.

The Davidsonian is committed to “the
opportunity for creative scholarship which
is fundamental to the best teaching,” as
the Statement of Purpose says. But there
is presently an air of suspicion among the
faculty. Never should professors feel
obligated to accuse the administration of
intimidation at a school of Davidson’s
Stature.

After waiting over a year for the
Administration to set down codified
procedures for faculty hiring and evalua-
tion, a proposal has finally been drafted
and submitted to the faculty through its
Professional Affairs Committee.

Although we applaud this action, the
delay in the release of a statement has not
been without cost.

A Jewish professor’s job offer was
rescinded last year because the College’s
hiring procedure and demands for “Chris-
tain commitment” in its faculty had not
been clearly outlined.

The contract of Professor of South
Asian Studies Tonia Devon was terminated
this year. Concern has been raised over
the subjectivity of the Administration’s
evaluation of her. ;

Because the evaluation criteria and
procedure have been unwritten, some
untenured faculty members have been
uncertain of the standards by which they
are judged.

We wish that the Professional Affairs

The proposed code of evaluation could
soothe the fears of young professors. And
we believe that it is essential to the
well-being of Davidson that those fears be
soothed immediately. So The Davidsonian
attempted to secure a copy of the code.
Our obligation to Davidson demands no
less.

This newspaper has no special rights.
Those rights belong to the College
community—the right of freedom of
expression. But we went after the code in
a manner that was very wrong. We admit
our guilt, and we're sorry that we let you
down.

Perhaps columnist Anthony Lewis best
expresses our feelings:

“The American press is often wrong and
unfair and silly; but it is also, often, the
only’ protection there is. James Madison
said 200 years ago that we must suffer its
‘abuse’ because of its essential function.
Judge Murray Gurfein put it: ‘A cantanker-
ous press, an obstinate press, a ubiqui-
tous press must be suffered by those in
authority in order to preserve the even
greater values of freedom of expression
and the right of the people to know.’ ”

The rights of free expression and of the
people to know are important here also.
Perhaps they are even more important in a
small academic community where a
Statement of ‘Purpose calls upon us to
continue our “‘ceaseless effort” to improve
the College.

The Davidsonian will continue to strug-
gle for those goals. But we promise to
struggle within the rules from here on out.

—Harry Greyard

At last, the Code

Committee had worked from the outset
with Zimmermann, that they had partici-
pated more actively in the actual writing of
the Code. Instead, the committee chose to
stand by until Zimmermann handed his
ideas to them.

The time has now come for faculty
members to carefully consider the pro-
posed Code and decide whether or not it
fulfills their expectations.

For example, there is still a very strong
emphasis on the Christian approach to
teaching and a faculty member's active
commitment as a Christian. Does this
mean, in practical terms, the exclusion of .
non-Christian approaches?

The faculty, and indeed, the entire Col-
lege community, must actively participate
in determining the nature of this Code
of Evaluation, for it will influence the
calibre of the Davidson faculty and the
quality of a Davidson Education for years
to come.

Why do Davidson students
take four years of Army ROTC?
This is the question I set out to
answer, hoping to inform the
student body that ROTC at
Davidson is pursued by energe-
tic, patriotic young men and
women seeking to do their
country a service.

Such was not the case, al-
though there were some excep-
tions. In fact, the very make-up
of the program at Davidson
discourages the development of
a regimented career man. So is
the Davidson ROTC program a
joke?

Not quite, but almost. Sa-
ving graces include one junior
who explained the reasons for
the College’s relaxed program.
Apparently, regional headquar-
ters at Fort Bragg recognizes a
need for well-rounded, well-edu-
cated officers from Davidson.
Too many recruits nowadays
romanticize war and enjoy the
rough, crew-cut image of VMI
and The Citadel. Davidson pro-
vides a necessary exception.

Also, there are Davidson
students involved in ROTC for
truly bizarre reasons, or at least
imaginative. One student in the
program is a physics major.
He signed on because he wants
to go to the moon. Happy
landing!

One junior gave a very com-
mon-sensical approach. He is on
a four year scholarship which
pays for tuition and books, plus
$100 a month. However, he
contends that financial aid is
not the.main attraction, for the
program offers a physically
challenging routine that is a
constructive respite from the
academically oriented plight of
many a Davidson student.

One fellow took the stereo-
typed viewpoint that many a
casual observer would expect.
The Army, he says, builds men,
bringing out in a cadet a latent
potential for action and manli-
ness. Adventure is the rule of
the day. The Boy Scouts put
the same thing on their recrui-
ting posters.

That is not to say that the
program at Davidson is without
merit. All the instructors have
combat experience under their
belts. Program participants ad-
dress the officers as ‘‘Professor
so-and-so,’’ not as ‘‘Colones
Ledford”’ or ‘‘Captain Kotula.’’
Salutes are unnecessary except

in formal ceremonies.

The regimen required by the
program is no doubt challen-
ging and educational. In class-
room sessions, cadets learn
military history in detail. Stu-
dents report that the instruc-
tors give lectures that are not
“sleepers,” the instructors be.
ing well-versed in their respec-
tive disciplines.

Field activities include rapel-
ling, orienteering, scuba diving,
and formal marching. Marks-
manship is stressed in the Belk
rifle range. Participants learn to
use effectively a various assort-
ment of modern weaponry.
Most dramatic of all, ROTC
cadets go through Army
maneuvers, including mock
battle strategies.

In short, the program itself is
not lacking. The problem with
Davidson ROTC is the partici-
pants’ motives for joining the
program. Of over a dozen cadets
interviewed, the vast majority
reported that they would not
be in the program if they did not
have a four year scholarship.
Such a scholarship pays for
everything except board fees.

Cadets’ patriotic leanings are
almost non-existent. A great
many describe themselves as
pacifists, arguing that all war is
wrong. In the event of another
Viet Nam type situation, all
reported that they would be
reluctant to fight but would be
obligated to do so.

In fact, only one student said
he plans to go into Combat
Arms following graduation,
which included infantry, artille-
ry, and armor. The rest seek
positions that involve anything
but combat duty.

For instance, a great number
want the Army to foot the bill
for medical school, Although
such plans would include up to
an eight year obligation of
active duty, they see no dif-
ference between doing their
internship and residency as
civilian or soldier.Davidson
seems to be producing
*M*A*S*H* units! Alan Alda,
eat your heart out.

Still others want the Army to
put them through law, dental,
or graduate school. But each
one argues that he is not ripping
off the Army. After all, the
Army offers this program, so
they would be foolish not to
take advantage of it. The Army
must know what it is doing,
they say.
