“Do you think Davidson’ s football program should
continue to compete in Division I athletics?”

Alan Hunter, class of ‘90

“Football in Division I? J don’t think it
would be a good idea. Being as academi-
cally inclined as we are--our football

program that is--I don’t think that we can.
physically compete with the bigger, less’

intellectual types from bigger schools. I
don’t think we should [be in Division I]
football but basketball-wise? Yes, be-
cause I’m what? A basketball player.”

Mary Erwin, class of ‘88

“I don’t know much about football, but if
it is going to hurt the other sports then I
don’t think we should change divisions.”

Charlie Winborne, class of ‘88

“That’s a touchy subject there. I think if
Davidson is going to compete in Division
I we’re going to have to give scholarships
to compete. . . I think the program is
getting better with bigger recruiting
classes but the problem is getting the
athletes in [because of academic stan-
dards].”

““We’ve got good talent now, and we
seem to be picking up a little in the last
couple of years. Even so we have got to
get moving or else we should move down
to Division III. . .if that wouldn’t mess up
basketball.”

Headlining the news October 22-
November 5:

to discuss a superpower summit
meeting. Plans. for a summit
meeting in “Washington were
made for December 7. President
Reagan and Soviet leader Gor-
bachev are expected to sign a
treaty eliminating medium-range
nuclear missiles at that time.
Gorbachev surprised U.S. Secre-
tary of State Shultz in Moscow
two weeks ago, and raised doubts
about the chances for a summit
meeting, by announcing that re-
strictions on the U.S. space weap-
ons system be part of the treaty.
Gorbachev seemed to have sof-
tened his demands in the past
week.

President Reagan announced a
U.S. trade embargo on Iran last
Monday, in response to Persian
Gulf hostilities. Iranian President
Ali Khamenei threatened closure
of the Strait of Hormuz if the ban

is implemented. On Wednesday,

’ November 4, Iran reported public

demonstrations, with masses of
people chanting anti-American
slogans. _ Wednesday was the
eighth anniversary of the capture
of the American Embassy-and the
taking of American hostages.

In a related issue, the U.S. ac-
cused China of selling military
weapons to Iran, a charge China
has denied.

In the Philippines, two Ameri-
cans were killed near the U.S.
Clark Air Base. A communist

group claimed responsibility and

threatened further American as-
sassinations. The U.S. has re-
stricted the movements of Ameri-
can personnel in the Philippines,
and warned American travelers of
danger.

ingly approved anew constitution
last Tuesday. The new
constitution decreases presiden-
tial power while increasing legis-
lative and judicial power. The

follows a summer of protest and

ment. South Korean President

Fébrivaty 25. The’ new
constitution establishes a system.
for direct presidential elections.

Japan’s next prime minister
will be Noburu Takeshita, a con-
sensus-building politician. Take-
shita, who was handpicked by
current Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, will face tough prob-
lems such as the U.S./Japan trade
imbalance.

Across the Nation -- White
House and congressional negotia-
tors met last Tuesday to discuss
ways in which to trim the U.S.
budget deficit. The recent stock
market crash added a sense of
urgency to the meeting.

The Senate voted 86-11 in favor
of a health insurance bill that
would increase medicare benefits.
The increased costs would be
funded by raising premiums.

In another vote the Senate ap-
proved, 93-0, appropriations of
$8.5 billion for military construc-

tion projects. The House ap-
proved similar appropriations in
July.

News reports indicate that the
Reagan Administration may be
reconsidering making a Novem-
ber request to Congress for $270
million in Nicaraguan contra aid.
The request may be postponed
until January, to.avoid disrupting
the regional peace plan which was
signed by Central American lead-
ers in August. Reagan Admini-
stration officials fear that an early
vote on contra funding would
provide the ruling Sandinista
Government of Nicaragua with an
excuse not to honor regional
peace plan commitments.

The nomination of Robert Bork
for Supreme Court justice was
defeated by a 58-42 Senate vote.
Federal appeals Judge Anthony
Kennedy of Sacremento has been
mentioned as a non-controversial
possibility for the next nominee.

place Carluccias national security
