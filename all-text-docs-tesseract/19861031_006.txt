The Hi unger, Nosferatu scare at movie fest.

By JOHN GILLIKIN
Our generation has seen the
demise of the horror film; true
horror has become, unfortunately,
the most abused and misun-
derstood medium in cinematic art.
It is either revoltingly misrep-
resented through the gruesome
guise of the “slasher” film or it is
so poorly directed that it inevita-
bly becomes a parody _of itself.
The Hunger, however, is a
powerfully disturbing yet dis-
cretely directed piece of cinematic
horror, which reassures the con-
noisseur that the true fright film
still exists.

The movie begins with David
Bowie dying of an unusual disease

which deprives the body of sleep’

and ages the tissue cells at a pre-
ternatural rate. Within days

twisted with extreme old age.
Catherine Deneuve is Bowie’s
wife and the film’s femme fatale.
She is actually an ancient Egyp-
tian queen who has remained
young for hundreds, of years
through sorcery and cannibalism.
Apparently the two shared a pact
throughout the ages, yet Bowie ul-
timately dies, succumbing to the
bizarre aging disease.

The Hunger does not depend
on frequent or graphic violence
for its frightening power; the im-
ages which shock are dark and
erotically bizarre. They. are dis-
turbing through implication, yet
will linger long in one’s mind.
The mood of the film is intense-
and unsettling; the use of light and .
shadow contrasts as well as vary-
ing cinematic speeds produce in
the film a surreal, symbolic at-
mosphere. Though he. is a well-

worn touchstone, Hitchcock is the
most obvious comparison. Like a
Hitchcock thriller, The Hunger al-
lows the monsters of our imagina-
tion to create the fear.

This is not a film for those who
seek only prettiness, convention
and resolution in a film. The
Hunger is a brilliant film, but
neither conventional nor pretty. It
is darkly sensual and unusual. It
will rivet you and unsettle you; but
if weldone horror is to your
taste, it will fascinate and delight
you.

Because this is a somewhat
different film from what the mod-
em movie audience may be accus-
tomed to, one must critically ap-
proach Nosferatu from a some-
what different angle. Nosferatu is
the original cinematic interpreta-

tion of the dracula story. This is
the silent 1921 version, and so
may seem unusual to those not ac-
quainted with movies from the si-
lent era. Yet this should not pre-
vent one from discerning its qual-
ity. Nosferatu, should be viewed
with the awareness of its historic-
ity and significance. It is the first
real vampire film and, except for
possibly The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari, the most eerily effective
of the early German expressionist
films.

The black and white film is
often considered inferior to
cinema shown in color, yet I con-
tend that when the atmosphere is
somber or unusual and the mood
macabre and dark, color somehow
weakens the willing suspension of
disbelief. Nosferatu’s horror re-
sults indirectly from this mood,

yet directly from the evil pro-
tagonist himself.

Nosferatu is a classic cinema-
tic fiend. His body is hideously
emaciated and his pallor a sicken-
ing paste-color. His eyes distend
grotesquely from their sockets, -
threatening to fall from a face that
has no skin. Yet the most frighten-
ing aspect of the vampire is his
hands. Obscenely large, they
like fat white spiders
threatening to suck the life from
the living.

~~

Nosferatu is a fine movie, yet
one may become anxious watch-
ing a full 90 minutes of a silent
film. I must admit that I-did not
view the movie in complete si-
lence; I played Pink Floyd’s “The
Wall” for background music,
which was powerfully conducive.
