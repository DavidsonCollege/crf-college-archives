BOOKS BY VACHEL LINDSAY
ADDED TO LIBRARY SHELVES

In the past few days several new ad-
ditions have been made to the library.
There are several interesting books by
one of America’s modern writers, Vachel
Lindsay. Among them are “General
William Booth Enters Into Heaven,”
“The Golden Whales of California,”
“The Golden Book of Springfield,”
“Adventures While Preaching the Gos-
pel of Beauty,” “The Chinese Nightin-
gale,” and several others.

The Davidson students and the public

Lindsay deliver several lectures at Shear-
er Hall, on April 26th. This will be one
of the greatest treats of the year.

FRESH-SOPH DEBATERS ARE
SLINGING THE OLD TAURUS

As is usual at this time of the year,
the Freshmen and Sophomores of the
Literary Societies are getting ready for
the big scrap, the Fresh-Soph debate.
Much interest has been displayed by
some of the members, and although there
has not been an ovdit-abundance ‘of
aspirants, there has not been a lack of

them. From each of the two societies
which have chosen their teams, there
were four men out, and the contests

were hot and scrappy.

From the Metrophilians, Wharton, W.
Z. Bradford and J. M. Carr wete chosen
to represent the society. From the
Pandeinics, Cox, Walthall and H. B.
Price, with McIlwane as alternate, were
chosen. The Eumeneans selected their
team on the night of March 13th, as fol-
lows: L. D, Elkins, Ralph Smith, H M.
Moss, with ‘A. M. Martin as alternate,
but the Phi’s have not yet decided on
their representatives.

To the best debater in each society,
a medal is to be given, and the two
societies who win out in the prelimi-
naries will debate for the inter-society
championship.

WILLIAM S. HART STARS IN
_..“TRAVELING ON” PICTURE

Williani?S. Hart, in “Traveling -On,”
was shown recently. This picture shows
the struggle of a missionary ‘and his
wife in a little Arizona town of the good
old days before fences came in style.

This preacher was a reformed knight
of the road and in desperation over lack
of funds for his church building went
back to his old tricks and held up a stage.
He took the money of. Dandy McGee, his
bitterest enemy. Dandy was already de-
termined to run him out of town in or-
der to iiave the preacher’s wife in his
power. He now decided to have the
preagher hung on suspicion of robbery.
This left things up to J. B. (Bill Hart).
J. B. wanted the preacher’s wife also,
but he was so touched by her pleading
for her husband that he took the blame
for the robbery himself. Of course, such
a consummate master of a .44 could not
e taken, but after killing McGee he rode
way on his spotted horse. The last
sdene shows him riding along reading
the Testament the preacher’s little .girl
taught him to read.
his was a fairly good picture as a
whole, but much of it was supposed to
take place at night during an awful
storm. This storm was very realistic,
but also straining on the eyes.

Next Saturday’s picture is to be Betty
Compson in “The Law and the Woman.”

GLEE CLUB HAD GREAT TRIP
TO GASTONIA MARCH TENTH

Last Friday, through torrents of rain
and. a sea of mud the Glee Club went to
Gastonia, where they gave a program at
the Central High School.

Although handicapped through the
illness of several of its members’ the
club gave a splendid program. Thecon-
cert had been well advertised and de-
spite the rainy weather a large crowd
was in attendance and responded most
graciously to each number.

The work of McLeod, Bogart, and Mc-
Geachy was outstanding, while the work
of Francis Northrop at the piano could
scarcely have been surpassed by Pade-
rewski himself. The numbers by the
chorus were rendered in fine style, be-
ing full of harmony and “pep.” The
vocal selections by McGeachy, McLeod,
and Jones did not fail to make a de-
cided hit and called for repeated en-
cores. Mention must also be made here
of the fine renditions of “old break-
downs,” etc., by the mandolin and guitar
group. This feature of the program was
received most enthusiastically of all.

At the conclusion of the concert a
reception was given the Glee Club by
the Ladies Auxiliary of the First Pres-
byterian Church, delicious rrefreshments
consisting of icé cream and cake being
served. Bob McLeod says the first six
plates of cream were fine!

The club left Gastonia on its home-
ward journey about 11 o'clock, arriving
on the hill in the wee sma’ hours of
Saturday morning.

DOCTOR PORTER PREPARING
VALUABLE ROCK COLLECTION

With the burning of Chambers there
went to destruction a most complete and
valuable collection of minerals, rocks,
and fossils. This, combined with the
revival of the Geology course, made
necessary a new collection ‘of rocks for
a geological laboratory. Dr. Porter, of
this department, brought with him a
small but complete collection of Texas
cretaceous minerals. He has, also, ob-
tained a systematic collection of rocks
and fossils from many parts of the world.
Those studying Geology know how com-
plete and interesting are these collec-
tions. Dr. Porter is now working to
complete a collection of the minerals
and rocks of North Carolina, The cost
of the laboratory will be great as the
specimens are of the most valuable and
instructive type available.

A complete set of geological maps
would enable the students to locate the
rock divisions more readily and would
be appreciated very much by the Geology
department. Here is one suggestion
for the Seniors in making their gift to
the college.

GAMMA SIGMA EPSILON HAS
AN INITIATION AND A FEED

On last Friday night, the Gamma Sig-
ma Epsilon Chemical Fraternity held its
Spring initiations. Three men of the
Junior class were duly revealed the
mysteries, and initiated into the rites of
the order. The trio to receive this dis-
tinction were H, H. Smith, N. R. Currie,
and C. F. Wildman. All three ‘men are
industrious and enthusiastic chemists,
having high scholastic standing for two
and a half years.

The initiation ceremony was followed
by a “feed” given in honor of the
neophytes.

At the next meeting of the organiza-
tion, the’ second paper of the series on
the interesting bio-chemical topic of
Vitamin will be delivered. Also the
biography of some great chemist’s life
will be presented.

and Pleasants look good for infield posi-
tions, but there are a host of others who
may develop into first-class men. For
the outfield positions, W. J. Richards,

SENIOR CLASS MAKES PLANS
AT FEED FOR
COMMENCEMENT

After the show last Saturday night, 80
Seniors gathered in the Physics room in
the gymnasium for one of the most en-
joyable meetings in the history of the
class. The evening began by a riotous
attack upon the refreshments provided,
and was prolonged until a late hour by
jokes, speeches, and word battles of
every description,

A part of the plans made for Com-
mencement will be of interest to all, as
many new features will be introduced
this year The Seniors decided to give a
play on Wednesday night, the proceeds
to go on the class gift fund. After the
play a big bonfire will be lighted in front
of Chambers each member of the class
contributing, with all due solemnity and
ceremony, the book which he hates most.
The crowd will then go on down to the
reception in the gymnasium.

There was:much discussion of a num-
ber of other stunts for Commencement,
and plans were formed to establish
distinctive customs and styles for Sen-
iors. Six or seven proposals were made
for the class gift, and those which were
deemed most practical were referred to
a committee for further investigation.

The occasion was a thoroughly enjoy-
able one throughout. The discussion
was animated by jibes and horseplay
between the rival factions, in which
Miller, McLeod, and Knox showed up as
shining lights.

METROPHILIAN SOCIETY IS

GETTING BUSINESS SETTLED

Since the Metrophilians left the Phi’s
they have found that there are many
things necessary for a society which
they had always been taken for granted
before. Plans for all these things were
made last Thursday evening in Phi Hall.

Every item was discussed at length
and barely had one thing been settled
when a new need would arise. Motions
and amendments flew thick and fast.

The Fresh-Soph debate preliminaries
were arranged, and plans for the so-
ciety commencement were drawn up. A
committee was appointed to select all
the medals, since it has been decided to
give four this year:. These are: Fresh-
Soph declaimer’s, Fresh-Soph debater’s,
Junior-Senior debater’s, and the Essay-
ist’s,

The regular program was postponed
for one week in order to give time for
the business. The men who were on for
this meeting will be on next weck.

SPRING BRINGS REVIVAL OF
HORSESHOE PITCHING GAME

With the warm spring weather horse-
shoe pitching once more reigns supreme.
John Keith started things off by de-

positing a couple of pegs between the

barracks. Keith is master of this sport,
vieing with the famous Jackson of Kan-
sas City for scoring honors.

Others were quick to follow his ex-
ample and now in whatever direction
one may look the conventional pegs
loom up on the horizon. The student
body now reverts to the time of Soc-
rates and Euripides when they used to
pitch quoits at the noon hour long, long
ago.

Pitching horseshoes is rightly a fay-
orite sport, for it is a man’s game with
an ancient lineage of an aged and dem-
ocratic nature. So proficient have the
various members of the student body be-
come that they might be termed the
“pitchinest boys in these parts.” There
is no doubt that in an intercollegiate
contest the Wildcat team could walk
away with the honors of the peg world,
defeating their opponents as slick and
clean as Willie’s Sunday School face.

Behold the agility of McCallum! See
him drop the shoes around the peg with
the unerring certainty of a hungry boy
connecting up with a piece of apple pie.
Then look, if you will, with favor on the
form of Guthrie. His is the perfect
horseshoe pitching form. Heel touching
the peg, his knee slightly bent, slowly
he advances th@right hand, raising the
shoe until it is ova level with the right
eye. Through the aperture he sights
the peg, flexes the wrist and—Presto!
another ringer. All this is done while
the spectators gaze in awe and admira-
tion.

To the famous William the Conqueror
we offer profound thanks for ‘instituting
such an honorable and exhilirating sport,
for was it not he who first invented
horseshoes?

ATHLETIC NEWS.

COACH HENGEVELD
VALUABLE AND HIGHLY-
REGARDED MAN

Fred W. (Dutch) Hengeveld graduated
from Davidson in 1918, having had the
honor of captaining two teams, winning
his monogram for three years in basket-
ball, and four years in baseball. He was
known throughout the South as a won-
derful athlete and a clean sportsman.

Three years ago the college authori-
ties wisely chose him to come back to
his alma mater and coach both the quint
and the nine. Since his return both
these branches of sport have attained
higher levels than ever “before, due to
his untiring efforts to produce teams
which are imbued with the old-time
Wildcat fighting spirit, of which he him-
self is so great a representative.

Coach Hengeveld’s ready smile and
his unfailing good humor and courtesy
have won for him a place in the heart
of every Davidson man.

Here’s to a true gentleman and man!

WILDCAT BALL TOSSERS
' TO LOCK HORNS
WITH ALL-STARS

Coach Hengeveld’s frolicking Wildcats
will make their debut Saturday after-
noon when they cross bats with the
Mecklenburg County League All-Stars.
This will be a battle royal between the
clean fielding, hard hitting, Red and
, Black Machine and a picked bunch of
cld-timers who handle a bat like it was
a toothpick, and who can still show the
way to many a younger aggregation.

.The admission, which will be 25 and 15
cents, will go to benefit the Davidson-
Cornelius Post of the American Legion.
Surely. no one will begrudge the two
bits they will have to put out when it
goes to such a worthy organization, and
they will see a ball game which gives
promise of being a thrilling, hard-fought
contest. :

Several old Davidson stars will do
battle against their alma mater on Sat-
urday. Among those appearing on the
line-up of the All-Stars are Currie, Bar-
nette, and Caldwell,

Probable line-ups for Saturday are as
follows:

All-Stars. Position. Davidson.
Barnhardt ~~ ..:-- -. -. -- -. McMillan
Catcher
Barnette -- -- -. -. -. -. -. Crawford
