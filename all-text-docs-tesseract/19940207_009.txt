THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS

“The mass of mankind will
‘never have any ardent zeal for see-
ing things as they are; very inad-
equate ideas will always satisfy
them." -Matthew Arnold

I am living in a dream world,

~-and-my-guess is that-you-probably—

are, too.
Every once in a while, do you
get really depressed? Maybe it’s
ewhen something triggers amemory
of rejection or when you get into a
situation that makes you feel vul-
nerable and alone. Perhaps you
remember the number of people
who will spend every day of their
lives in a prison cell or you try to
conceptualize the fact that hun-
dreds of thousands of people in our
country today do not have a place
to call home.
The grim reality of life lies
just below the surface. We avoid

Reality is tough, but why fake it?

it, we conceal it, and we lie about
it, even to ourselves, Our times of

depression-occur-when-we-fait-at—

attempts to escape and we actually
see the truth.

Let’s look at an example. jane
Campion’s film The Piano con-
veyed many examples of injustice
in our world. Scott McLean’s re-
view of the movie in the Davidso-
nian represented his and our ten-
dency to avoid dealing with the
truth.

In the movie, amute woman is
boughtas a mail-order bride. Later,
she agrees to give sexual favors to
astranger in exchange for the own-
ership of her piano. Her young
daughter, whom she locks outside

the house, observes her naked
mother being molested through a
‘crack inthe door:Eventually, the
woman’s husband chops off her
finger with an axe in a fit of jeal-
ousy. And Scott “found it difficult
to feel anything but apathy for any
of the characters.”

McLean’s blatantly apathetic
reaction to the offenses of sexual
abuse, domestic violence, devalu-
ation of women, child abuse, adul-
tery, and prostitution reflects the
numbness of our culture. We do
anything not to have to deal with
facing pain. In efforts to avoid the
truth, we have created a world of
escapism.

But neither the truth, nor the

painful effects of the truth will just
go away.

——Another——example:——In
McLean’s review of Philadelphia,
amovie about the tragedy of AIDS,
he shares his feelings only about
the movie’s camera techniques and
the actors’ abilities to “pull off”
close-in shots.

We also pull off concealing
many social catastrophes in our
society. We tuck our elderly away
in “homes” where they won’t
bother us. The wealthy conglom-
erate in their own neighborhoods
so they won’t have to look at poor
people. Addicts drown themselves
in entertainment, fashion, and abu-
sive substances in order to allevi-

ate the reality of pain they feel.
Many people at Davidson laugh at
their problems to escape from them.
What they don’t realize is that their
laughter prevents them from expe-
riencing true joy.

___—Reality hurts, but hope is real
I think we need to prove Matthew

Arnold wrong, and develop a zeal
for seeing things as they really are.
Only when we have faced the truth
will we be able to alleviate the pain
that harbors below the surface,
within ourselves and in our envi-
ronment.

The next time you feel de-
pressed about the painful truths in
your life, let yourself feel the pain.
Be true to yourself and to God.
Bring your wounded spirit before
your Creator and become a new
creation. Only then will your hope
become reality.

Rob King

The yin of human
relationships.

Before I get started with my
“serious” article, I would like to
make one humorous observation.
Doesn’t the picture of Tom Bavis
with those headphones on look sort
of like Princess Leia? (If you have
seen the movie Spaceballs, then
you know what I mean.) Anyway,
here’s the serious stuff (and by the
way, Tom, please do not take of-
fense to my humorous observa-
tion).

Alittle half-naked brown man
bringing the mighty British empire
to its knees . . . A black Baptist
preacher from Atlanta ending seg-
‘Tegation in the southern United
States . .. A twenty-two year old
college student from St. Peters-
burg, Florida, saving a budding
friendship from going down the
tubes. So what do these three
people all have in common you
may ask? All three of us have
experienced in some way the true
effectiveness of the nonviolent
method. (In case you haven’t
guessed it already, the two other
people I have mentioned are
Mohandas K. Gandhi and Martin
Luther King, Jr.)

So where is the connection?
I’m not really interested in leading
some massive social movement or
conducting sit-ins at the Union
Outpost.

Tobe honest, when I first heard
about nonviolent resistance (no-
tice the word “resistance,” which
means the method does confront
the opposing party) I thought that
it represented a great method for
massive social change, but in my
relations with other people I still
adhered to my mother’s militant
Catholic outlook of just war.

From an early age, I was
taught that if someone hits me or
insults me, then I am justified in
returning the bloody nose or caus-
tic word with a similar counterat-
tack, and even a little bit extra for
good measure.

Even though we live in the
refined and sophisticated Davidson
College community where disputes
are usually not settled with physi-
cal violence, I still think that we
are all guilty of psychological vio-
lence in relationships. Countless
times I have exchanged an angry
word or insult with an even more
cutting word or insult. I’ll show
him (or her)! No one can get the
best of me.

Recently—Idon’ tasally know
why I handled this situation differ-
ently—I handled a dispute with a
newly found friend in a different
way. Every time she would lash
out at me or hurl an angry word my
way, I would just smile and make

an even bigger, more deliberate
effort to be nice toher. At first, she
thought I was stupid (or some-
thing), and then she eventually
became so infuriated with my con-
stant niceness that the attacks grew
more severe, and I started thinking
about throwing in the towel and
ending the relationship.

Right at this time, when I was
ready to give up, a truly miracu-
lous thing happened—we sat down
and talked, were finally completely
honest with each other, and we
both ended up saving our budding
friendship.

Wow, meeting belligerent
force with the divine power of
God’s love. What a radical con-
cept! And the best part of the
whole experience was that the end
result was extremely constructive.
We are now able to become much
better friends than we were ca-
pable of before the dispute.

So, what the hell does this
have to do with the Chinese notion
of yin? In order to answer this
question, I will sign off with a
single image.

Lao Tzu once described the
awesome power ofa tiny stream in
relation to a huge boulder. The
boulder looks extremely strong and
durable, yet when a stream en-
counters. such an obstacle in its
path, the stream does not try to go
through the boulder, but rather gen-
tly flows around the boulder.

Give this little stream a thou-
sand years or so and the boulder
will be nothing more than particles
of sand flowing down the riverbed.
This is yin. This is the true power
of nonviolence.

Aftermath of drunk driving accident lingers

Mark continued from page 8

= faces. The funeral procession was
‘ miles long. Police officers escorted
us across town to bury our dear
friend. And as I said my last good-
bye, I choked at the thought of
never seeing him again, of burying
another friend, of not making it
glaringly clear when I loved some-
one.
My life changed that day. He
died, and part of me died also. A
part of him was in each of us, but
the memory of the tragedy was
blatant as we thought of a friend
who lay in acoma just miles away,
a victim of the same drinking and
driving accident. He would awake
weeks later with memories of a

_ Mustang and, vaguely, a close

friend. He would never wrestle
again, walk without a limp, talk
without a slur, or look through
uncrossed eyes. All of this for a

‘ couple of beers before trying to

make curfew.

| Tost two friends that night in
a car wreck caused solely from
ignorance—the belief of being in-
vincible when you are young and
beautiful and everyone loves you.
One I will never see again; I will
never laugh with him again or
bicker with him anymore. The other
friend I will never be able to truly
speak to again. I will not be able to
look at him and think of anything
else—he is something different to
me now, almost a walking lesson

rather than a person.

More importantly, Mark died
without knowing how much I re-
ally loved him, how much he meant
to me, how much I appreciated his.
friendship. That is by far the most

painful thing I have done to my-

self.

I realize now how uncertain
tomorrow is, how important it is’
for people to know they are loved,
and how I never want to make that
mistake again.

And “The Greatest American
Hero” plays oninmy mind. Mark
will live within me forever since
his time to-be with us has passed.
And the thoughts keep bringing
him back. If only something else
could.

The drug i image continues s to sell

Drugs continued from page 8

able to most high school students
because of the expense, but
Phoenix’s timely death does re-
flect the increasingly open attitude
that the youth in America are tak-
ing toward illicit substances.

Much more now than a few
years ago, but certainly much less
than in the 1970s, the members of
this generation are making mind
alteration a central part of their
social life. .

The thing | find so catching
about this development is the fact
that it is taking place among the
most environmentally and health
conscious, politically correct group
of young people to ever exist in
this country.

Kennedy points out that, in
Hollywood, it is much more ac-
ceptable to take heroin than to eat
red meat, forexample. River Phoe-
nix was an avid vegetarian and a
spokesperson for an animal rights
group, while slowly becoming a
kind of animal himself.

Many of the figurelieads of
this culture actually and:blatantly
condone drugs. The, most media-
happy example is the ‘group Cy-
press Hill, whose songs such as
“Legalize It” don’t mince words.

And then the pop culture icons
that try to send.a different message
are so hypocritical one can do nath-
ing butlaugh. Beverly Hills, 90210,
a literal mainstay of American
youth, is now running its second
drug plot since that messy busi-
ness with Emily Valentine. That is
very commendable from.a socio-
logical standpoint, but it is hard to
take social messages seriously
when they come from Shannen
Doherty. It’s like hearing a public
service announcement from Ma-
donna exalting the mys of mo-
nogamy.

Drugs never disappeared,

though. For the last twenty years,
The Grateful Dead has been one of
the most money-making musical
groups in the world. One reason is
they tour year-round, Another rea-
son is they sell drugs.

I doubt Jerry Garcia runs a

» drug ring from backstage, but The

Grateful Dead certainly sells the
image.

And it has sold well. Mari-
juana and LSD paraphernalia can
be seen on cars, on walls, around
necks and fingers, almost any-
where.

But does this necessarily mean
that drugs, especially illegal ones,
are on the return?. Of course not, it
just means that drugs are coming
out of the closet—again.

After the drug culture of the

* 1960s lost its velocity, drugs went

underground. Actually, they went
above ground.

The late 70s and early 80s
were the time of closed cocaine
parties hosted and paid for by the
ultra-chic and ultra-rich.

Now, according to Blonston’s
data, these parties are opening.
Taboos inthis culture have a way
of losing their unattractiveness over
time, anditis happening with drugs.

', Proponents of the freedom of
the 60s and 70s.and the support of .
bands like Cypress Hill are being
heard, it seems. :

_ And this may not be a bad
thing. Only when drugs are brought
out into the open will the truth be
clear,

Perhaps we will discover that
drugs are a relatively healthy pas-
time compared with some of our
other habits. Then again, we may
discover the opposite.

What will be the outcome un-
til then? Like Amy, a 22-year old
club hopper, says in Kennedy’s
article, “You could end up like
River Phoenix or you could end up
in the White House.”
