Emanon Edges SAE In Key Game

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
And
NO BUCKY

In the suspenseful ending of
the regular flickerball season
Emanon whipped SAE No. 1 in
an overtime decision. _

With a fourth down and 9
yards to go for a victory,
Calvin Allen threw a pass to
Larry Ruddell. Ruddell
managed to get one stride
across the line to secure the
Emanon victory.

Prior to the clutch pass, the
regulation game had expired
with the score tied 26-26. The
SAEs drove 27 yards in their
four downs and then Emanon
came right back to win it.
Hopefully, these two fine
teams will make it to the finals
for a rematch.

CA and No Buck are in no
mood to individually highlight
each game, so if we don’t talk
about your game this week,
go complain to Calvin Allen
for scheduling so many games
this week.

Last Thursday R-2 beat
PDT 25-7, SPE crushed S-4, 31-
7, and the Tennis Bums nipped
ATO, 19-18.

Wednesday, Emanon
defeated the KA's, 18-12 in.a
hard fought battle and the
Cleveland Indians won an im-

league battle as they
edged out the North Main

Gozinyas, 32-24. SAE crushed
past the MG’s 39-7 and PAX
destroyed R-2, 46-12.

After Wednesday comes
Thursday, and S4, R-3, and
the MG's all collected easy
forfeit wins over the AA, C-3,
and the SIFs, disrespectively.
The only real game saw the
KA’s nip C-1, 26-14.

Monday, Emanon had the
biggie with SAE. PGDfired the
ATOs 50-12. The Tennis Bums
rocketted past the AAs 50-19,
and the SIFs came through
with another forfeit, this one
to the KA’s.

At 4:00 on Monday (Calvin
had to get the games in
quickly), the PKAs sobered up
the Gozinyas 40-19. The Tribe
smashed PAX, 48-32, and SAE
No. 2 was shacked by R-3, 44-
12.

Tuesday, C-1 whooshed by
the MGs 13-0, the Pikas rum-
bled past R-2, 51-7, the
Gozinyas nipped the leaky
Delts 28-20, and SAE-2 tiptoed
past the Plus 7-0.
What a defensive battle. Well
anyways, it must have been a
battle.

On Sunday, against all

FINE FLICK
Marty Williamson initiates a flick against ATO. Williamson
and Chris Young led PGD to an easy 50-12 victory despite the
defensive efforts of John Stanfield.

VMI placed substantial doubt
in those minds. The Citadel
contest represents the future
prospects for Davidson in SC
football.

They will, most assuredly, be
out to end the season on a win-

into their grid program
for the future years.

It should indeed be in-
teresting to see which team
will be able to shake off their
frustrations and dissap-

ts in order to come
through with a clutch per-
formance in the final af-
ternoon of gridiron action for
each club this year.

SCTE Eee eee tet

and C-II] nipped the turkeys of
C-IV, 27-25.

Don’t worry, though. If we
can go into class on Good
Friday, we sure as hell can
play flickerball on Sunday.

Alright, a quick note on how
the three-on-three basketball
tournament is coming. It is
about halfway through at this
time.

Starting with 63 teams, the
si ination affair has
dwindled down to the final 16
squads. Play should end next
Monday or Thursday. We
refuse to give all the scores
because of the nose pickings

above that just plowed
through.

Now CA and No Buck have
been confronted by a serious
issue.

Some turkeys over in C-IV
(we are not sure exactly who,
so we will blame the whole
hall) have accused us of some
lack of talent in assessing the
ability of a certain team. You
guessed it. The team is C-IV.

Those fowl claim
that they are 4-1 in the gar-
bage league due to their
superior athletic ability.

CA and No Buck call
bullshit. Young Buck has a

gathering of syphletic geese
that could crush these
aerodynamically-inferior,
lice infected birds in less than
a half of a regular flicker-
ball game.

Some of the teams in that
semblance of a league can not
even find the fields, let alone
play the game, which ac-
counts for half of C-IVs wins
coming on forfeits. Enough

verge of freeing Young Buck
from the clutches of the
hideous ax man. Look for him
to return in a couple of weeks.
Captain America tilts again.
