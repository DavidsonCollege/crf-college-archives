. . . Governor reviews Davidson education

(Continued from page 2)

to bring into the Adminis-
tration in Raleigh.”

In an interview coriducted
earlier this year at Davidson,
the Governor remarked that
his Davidson education helped
to prepare him for his career in
politics. i

“Well, it’s hard to say about

specific things..One thing I
can look back at Davidson and
see in that it taught me to
have respect for other people.

And it taught me to try to
reason out a problem in a sane
and reasonable way. That’s
pretty important in govern-
ment because there are always
many alternatives to prob-
lems.”

- Before attending the School
of Law at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Holshouser attended David-
son College (Class of 56).

While at Davidson, he
majored in history and was
sports editor of both The
Davidsonian and The Quips
and Cranks. He kept the
basketball team’s scoreboards

will cater to rural needs,

ality and malnutrition. I hope
our work will reawaken the
AMA.”

“In our proposed work, we
will obtain an incredible
amount of data. The project
has real potential. It is not a
lark; not just a trip to Eng-
land, but will require a tre-
mendous amount of work,”
said Petrowski.

Murphey and Petrowski

have no idea whether they will
recieve these grants, and the
SOS grant winners will not be
announced until March. If
they recieve this grant, they
will need four other students
to help carry out the research.

“In writing the grant pro-
posals alone we have spent
countless hours,’’ said
Murphey.

Murphey hopes to attend
medical school upon gradua-
tion and Petrowski has not
decided between medical
school and K-Mart clerkship.
