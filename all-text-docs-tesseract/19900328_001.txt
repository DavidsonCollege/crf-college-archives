Faculty passes proposal instituting minus
grades; SGA to sponsor student poll

By JOE MARIS

Last week the much contested pro-
posal to implementa system of minuses
into the present grading system of
Davidson College was called to vote
and passed in the monthly faculty
meeting.

Introduced last year, the proposed
addition of minuses would break each
letter grade into three segments. The
lower segment would become the mi-
nus grade, the middle segment would
become the regular gradeand the upper
segment would become the plus grade.
A “B-” would approximate 2.7 grade
points, a B would equal 3.0 grade points
and a B+ would approximate 3.5 grade
points.

The system was proposed to the
Educational Policy Committee last
year. Last fall, a forum was held to en-
courage student input on the subject.

The Educational Policy Committee dis-

cussed the pros and cons mentioned in
the forum, and recommended that the

proposal be brought to a vote at the

faculty meeting. Voting was held and
the proposal was passed.

Tony Abbott, chairman of the English
Department, cites many advantages for
the minus system. He says, many teach-
ers whose courses are not graded nu-

merically are forced to give students.

with a lower ended grade the same

grade as students with a higher ended

grade. To make up for this many teach-

he says, would give teachers a less arti-
ficial grading system to work with re-
sulting in higher grades for many of the

He adds that while the minus system

might hurt some straight A students it
would most likely benefit the straight
B+ students.

Abbott says that no other college
studied by the committee hasa grading
system similar to Davidson’s.

He maintains that graduate schools
will take this into consideration, and
will most likely adjust the grade points
accordingly.

Many of the science and mathematics
professors believe that the new grading
system will have little effect on their
classes. Donald Kimmel, professor of
biology, said, “It would be easy to set
our numbersin the system.” The grades
won't change, hé.says, but the grade
points will, resulting in a decline in
GPA’s for many science students.

The proposal is reversible and might

be changed if students raise concern
about the new system. SGA President
Doug Jobe encourages. all students to
discuss the new system with the faculty
and to attend an open forum on March
28.

Following the April 3rd SGA poll on
this subject, if enough concern is ex-
pressed concerning the new system the
faculty will reconsider the proposal and
revote. If the plan remains unchanged,
it will be implemented by the college
next fall.
