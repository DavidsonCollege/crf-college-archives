Faculty Vote Continues Honors College

By BOB HOWELL
Managing Editor

The faculty voted this week to
continue the Honors College for
a three-year trial period, by a
vote of 38-37 with one ab-
stention.

“After a lot of debate, the
faculty voted to accept in prin-
ciple a report written by Drs.
Johnston, MacCormac and
Bevan,” said College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

“It is recommended,” reads
the report, “that the Honors
College be continued at David-
son College for a period of three
years, to be reviewed during the
third year of its operation (1975-
76) by the Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) of the
Faculty.”

The recommendation
cluded suggestions

proving the operation of the
Honors College as it now exists.

At the faculty meeting
previous to the one Tuesday, the
faculty had referred to the EPC
a proposal to abolish the Honors
College as a separate institution
and incorporate honors level
studies into the college's
regular curriculum.

The EPC met again with the
Committe for Evaluation of the
Honors College and with John-
ston, MacCormac and Bevan to
discuss with them their set of

recommendations.
Tuesday the EPC _ brought
back to the faculty both

proposals for discussion. Also
submitted were a_ petition
signed by 591 students in
fvaoring of continuing the
Honors College for a three vear
trial period and a_ letter
protesting the petition.

Steve Dodd and Miles Ward.
student members uf the EPC.
were allowed to speak on the
question.

Bevan said the recom-
mendations were distillations of
discussion on the Honors
College's weaknesses that he.
Johnston and MacCormac had
held since last spring.

He was _ disappointed.
however. that a_ formal
evaluation of the Honors
College had been conducted so
early.

“The proposal will be
reworked in light of the
faculty's discussion and will
come back to the faculty for
final approval.” Spencer ex-
plained.

“You can almost always find
bases for discontinuing a very
young program.” he observed.

FOOTBALL AT OPEN END
The debate continues on subsidization.

Open End Covers Subsidized
Athletics Benefits And Woes

By HARRIETT HODGES
News Editor

Davidson football coach Dave
Fagg said that Davidson had
“no business being a part of the
Southern Conference if we
stand for what we say we do™ in
an Open End _ discussion
Tuesday night.

“Do you realize that the
Southern conference is one of
the few without any academic
regulations? I've got a real

ion about the Southern
ference and our business in
it,’ Fagg said.

As an alternative to Southern
Conference affiliation, David-
son could play. non-subsidized
football. according to Fagg.

**But I think there are a lot of
misconceptions about non-
subsidized football.’ Fagg said.
“It still costs a lot of money,
and it’s still hard work."

Biology Professer David
Grant, representing the Faculty

, Committee on Athletics. con-

curred saying, **Non-subsidized
football might be more ex-
pensive because there are no

non-subsidized opponents
in the area, and this would
necessitate traveling long
distances to play.”

Fagg said that he had heard a
lot of talk about the lack of suc-
cess of the football team.

I think so much of the time
we relate this lack of success to
basketball success. If you'd
give the football team the same
opportunity for success as the
basketball team has I'd leave
after four years if we didn't give
you what you'd consider a suc-
cess,”’ he said.

**It sounds like the students,
faculty, and administration are
not behind subsidizing foot-
ball,’ Fagg said.

“Whatever we do with our
athletic program, we need your
100 percent support,"’ he added.

Grant reported on the Mon-
treat conference on athletics.
Members of the faculty, ad-
ministration, student body and
trustees met to discuss the
future of subsidized athletics.

“No conclusions came from
that meeting."" Grant said.
“Lots of alternatives were
discussed. but no recom-

mendations were made.

“There are lots of ways of
looking at the question of sub-
sidization,” he said.

“A personal viewpoint of
mine is that it may not be
possible to keep all programs,
both athletic and academic,
that we would like. While
athletics are important, we
should maintain a priority on
academics, * he continued.

Grant said that the ultimate
question was which system
would be the best for Davidson.
“I'm not sure under what cir-
cumstances Davidson should
play athletics,‘ Grant said.

“I like the idea of people
playing sports because they en-
joy doing it," he said.

The debate among the ap-
proximately 80 students present
and the panel members raged
on for two and one-half hours
without any conclusions being
reached.

A variety of viewpoints were
expressed and contested by
others present.

The panel consisted of Fagg.
Grant, SGA President Bo
Phillips. and former football
plaver Mike Creasman.
