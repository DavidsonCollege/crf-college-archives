Smoking Will Kill Your Butt

This is a harder article to write
for me than one on alcohol or caf-
feine. You see, at the risk of sound-
ing “holier-than-thou”, I’ve never
smoked. Therefore,-I-don’t know
what the attraction is to-a lighted
cigarette, and I can’t understand
how hard smoking is to quit, al-
though I’ve read and heard quite a
bit about it. 1 know how important
it is to quit, however, and lately it
seems that more and more people
around me are smoking, so -- what
to do‘about it?

--Smoking causes headaches,
ulcers, gum disease and tooth
decay, cancers of the mouth,
esophagus, bladder and lungs,
and poor circulation. It can lead
to stroke, emphysema, bronchi-
tis, and heart attack.

--Smoking is the cause of death
for 400,000 people a year in the
United States.

---Non-smokers are endangered
by the smokers around them. On
the average, non-smoking spouses
of smokers die four years younger
than non-smoking spouses of non-
smokers.

--Children are more likely to
smoke if their parents smoke.

--There is no evidence that
“low tar” cigarettes reduce the risk
of smoking-induced cancer and
heart disease. This is because being

“low tar” doesn’t effect the carbon
monoxide in a cigarette which
deprives the blood of oxygen.

Why do you,. personally,
smoke? The US. Public- Health
Service identifies six categorics of
justification for smoking: stimula-
tion, handling, relaxation, tension
reduction, craving, and habit.

A stimulation smoker enjoys
the physiological effects of nico-
tine. Smoking gives her a needed
boostof energy, much like a morn-
ing cup of coffee might do. The
actual smoking ritual is of impor-
tance for those who smoke for han-
dling. They enjoy the feel of the
cigarette between their fingers,
lighting up ‘and watching the
smoke.

Smoke can be both calming
and stimulating. Relaxation smok-
ers enjoy smoking when they are
most relaxed. For them it is simply
a pleasant pastime.

On the other hand, a tension
reduction smoker needs a ciga-
rette when he is angry or upset.
Cigarettes have a calming effect,
and are used as a psychological
“crutch” to help deal, with stress.
For craving smokers, the physical
addiction to cigarettes is very real,
and they cannot bear to be without
a cigarette for any length of time.

Habit smokers may light up a

The men whocreated the genre
of Southern rock whipped up a big
batch of legend tarnishing cream
with this album. I was all pumped
to hear it after reading Mikal

Let me begin by telling you
about my late brother. :

As I boarded the big ol’ jet
airliner that was to take me to
Europe for the summer the last
thing I said to anyone in my family
was to my brother. “Ward,” I said
looking the innocent little trooper
straight in his rapidly moistening
eyes,”go see the Allmans’ when
they hit Adanta.”

He didn’t and on my return I
dismembered him.

Now I think ‘he, might have

couldn’ trightly recountthe spooky.

history of one of the best five bands
ever and then turn around and say
that Seven Turns is a wrong turn. I

- And although I love this band -

as much as anyone, their new al-
bum reminds me of when the Great-
est, Mohammed Ali, tried to make

knocked out of him. The saddest
part is that I got the impression

asong onthe album half asgoodas ~~ fo

cigarette without remembering the
one they already have in their
mouths, or they may notremember
lighting up the one they are smok-
ing. Smoking for them is an auto-
matic response, something they do
without even thinking about it.

You probably enjoy smoking
for some combination of these
reasons. If so, smoking will be
harder for you to quit than if you
have one simple reason for smok-
ing. Here are some ideas for break-
ing the habit:

Depending upon your reasons
for smoking, try other substitutes
for what smoking provides you.
Watch out for situations which
might be conducive to smoking.

-Substitute orange juice for coffee,

since citrus juices reduce the crav-
ing for cigarettes. *

It has been proven that smok-
ers who quit ‘‘cold turkey” are much
more likely to quit for good than
those who try to gradually wean
themselves from smoking.

Remember that. withdrawal
symptoms such as dry mouth and
thirst, upset stomach, irritability
and mood swings are all positive
signs that the body is cleaning it-
self out, and these side effects will

from Gilmore’s article that they
think they did a great job.

Allman says,” It’s a good rec-
ord; I’m proud of it.”

- Not.

Dicky Betts says, "It would
have been a shame to have put this
band back together just to be an
embarrassment.” See Ali remi-

I really’ don’t want to com-

too bad-- but I’ll say this, hear the

If you like them, have at it but,

there are a few other Allmans’ -

Hubbeli, who often fights with her
husband; a Mexican woman who
sells flowers; and a nurse.

These roles tend often towards
stereotypical. female and ethnic
roles.

The male roles are also “tradi-
tional”; Stanley is a workingman,
a poker player and amember of a

bowling team. His buddies, Steve
Hubbell, Harold Mitchell and Pablo

Gonzales are less aggressive, and

“Mitch” is devoted to taking care
of his dying mother.
The other males in the play are
a collector for the newspaper, and
a doctor.
The actors performed welland
: the production was one of quality.

I chose to review this play without
previous knowledgeofit,and found

I did not like the play itself for
its abuse of women by men and its

overall stereotypes. .

McMillen is McActive

By BENNET WATERS

If there is one word that de-
scribes Davidson history profcs-
sor Sally McMillen, ACTIVE is
definitely that word.

But, McMillen doesn’t sitgply
participate in a wide range of ac-
tivities; she is truly enthusiastic
about all of them.

McMillen was born and raised
in Laguna Beach, California. She
attended Wellesley College, and
was married soon after graduation.

After working as a librarian
for a short time, and raising two
children, McMillen decided to
pursue her Masters degree in his-
tory.

In 1985, McMillen received a
PhD in history from Duke, after

are~-commuting—from-Charlot

nights a week to complet the
program.

McMillen came to Davidson
after a short time at Middle Ten-
nessee State. “I always wanted
something more, and I had always
dreamed of a liberal arts school,”
she recalls.

When Davidson advertised for
a history position, McMillen re-
turned to the Charlotte area, bring-
ing aspecialty in Southern History
and Women’s History with her.

Since then, McMillen has pub-
lished one book (Motherhood in
the Old South,) and she has another
work being published now.

McMillen believes strongly in
pushing her students, and she
expects a lot from them. “TI really
believe ,in climbing mouniains...
_always pushing harder,” she says.

McMillen’s - students. are
“asked todomore than they thought
they could.”

Versatility is one of McMillen’s
strong points, and she prides her-
self on her activitics: “I love the
outdoors... backpacking, bike trips,
downhill skiing... anything in the
out-of-doors.”

McMillen also enjoys going to
movies, reading, listening to clas-
sical music and cooking. (During
exams, she brings home-made
chocolate chip cookies to her stu-
dents.)

o.describe hersclf

as a breakfast cercal, McMillen

chose Raisin Bran. “It’s fairly
wholesome,” she said, “but some-
what sweet... sort of energizing but
certainly not boring.”

When pushed further, and
asked to pick a part of a car that
describes her, she. quickly chose
the radio. “It provides entertain-
ment... it’s soothing, yetstill stimu-
lating... and its essential in a car.”

McMillen is extremely enthu-
siastic, and that enthusiasm carries
over to everything she does.

» She demands a lot from those
around her, but only because she ©
demands so much from herself first.
