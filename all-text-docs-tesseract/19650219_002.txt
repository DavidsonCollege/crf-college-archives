The Question

After drifting in the doldrums for
three months, the fraternity question
is again demanding the attention of
the Davidson community.

Due by March 1 is the report of
the Fraternity Evaluation Committee,
3 report which is almost sure to recom-
mend changes in the present system.

The committee, instituted in De-
cember by Student Council, has met
frequently and at length. Neverthe-
less, attendance of members has been
commendably regular at the sessions
where a spectrum of ideas— ranging
from maintaining the status quo to
abolishing fraternities — has been
tossed around the conference table.

Whatever the committee recom-
mends will be the product of serious
thought and intensive examination
over an extended period of time. That
there will be objections to the report
is inevitable: there are too many di-
vergent views for any sane person
to anticipate a concensus. __

Rather we can hope for a positive, a
constructive attitude from those who
take issue with the report. To merely
attack will not be sufficient; the an-
tagonists must be prepared to suggest
acceptable alternatives.

That the fraternities fulfill a neces-
sary function as the centers of social

Council Counsel

Apparently they were mostly con-
cerned with their own Lilliputian
political positions. But such a con-
clusion might be unfair. Perhaps they
envision Davidson as that sleepy lit-
tle Southern college described by a
modern-day Romantic on Sports l-
lustrated’s glossy pages last year, vig-
orous political campaigns might ruf-
fle the leaves on those neatly trimmed
shrubberies. Indeed, there might even
be a poster on the ivy-covered, old-
brick walls.

The reason is unimportant; the ac-
tion is not. Student Council has ex-
pressed its willingness to be satisfied
with a voting turnout which in all
probability will not surpass 65 per-
cent.

Many schools would be delighted
with such a high turnout. But must we
be satisfied and complacent while at
least one out of every three students
fails to cast the ballot which is right-
fully his?

This, in effect, is the attitude con-

veyed by the action—or, more prop-
arly, inaction—of Council Monday
right.
Representative Fred Sackett, who
has carefully studied the elections
procedure at Davidson, presented a
number of proposals at the group’s
meeting Monday night, proposals
aimed at improving the Davidson elec-
Too Vindictive

In newly independent countries of
Africa, where there is no tradition
of nationhood, the “father” of inde-
pendence easily becomes the embodi-
ment of sovereignty. Any threat to his
person or position after independence
gan therefore seem treacherous or
attempted subversion of the state.
This, of course, explains why newly
independent countries bequeathed a
constitution providing for parliamen-
tary opposition often lose little time
in reorganizing themselves into one-
party states.

This should be remembered and
understood whenever there is an urge
in the West to criticize such leaders
as President Nkrumah of Ghana. But

even having recalled such basic facts
about political development in Africa,
it is still painful and distressing to
see the outcome of the four-month
political trial which ended in Ghana
this week with five Ghanaians getting
capital sentences. Dr Nkrumah is a
civilized man. Since there is no ap-
peal from the court’s decision, men
of goodwill everywhere must hope
that he will intervene at least to pre-
vent what would be political execu-
tions.

The Ghanaian President seems to
nave been determined to secure the
conviction of the five men—two of

ever, would

Davidson student. That is, unless a
suitable substitute to the fraternity
system can be found.

Will modification of the present ar-
rangement—such as the initiating sop-
homore rush—be the answer? Or will
the problems best be answered by
more sweeping changes, perhaps even
in the basic organization of social life?

At first glance these appear to be
the essential. questions; that they are
of great import cannot be denied.
But even more basic is an intensive
look at the college itself. What is the
goal of Davidson College? And does
the present social organization pro-
mote—or inhibit—this goal?

This is the question which must
first be answered.Then—and only
then, can we examine the current sys-
tem and proposed changes in the
proper perspective.

tions. The representatives rejected a
majority of the proposals.

Sackett has ‘been criticized for the
means he utilized in drafting the pro-
posals and in presenting them to Coun-
cil. But these criticisms are certainly
not valid objections to the proposals
themselves. ;

The suggested changes merit re-
consideration. Some students fear un-
ruly campaigns. Far more real to us
is the possibility of overly sedate elec-
tions.

Still posted in the Union, are min-
utes of Council’s meeting on Decem-
ber 9. Has the fact that these have
not been replaced by more up-to.
date minutes indicate that Council
has done nothing since two-and-a-half
months ago? —

We have always had the impression
that sessions of Student Council were
intended to be open meetings. More-
over, we have understood that meet-
ings were scheduled for 7 p. m. on
Mondays. This was certainly true last
Monday—even the Union calendar
said the meeting would be on Feb.
15 at 7 p. m. in the Blue Room. But
the meeting did not take place, at
least not then. The “public” meet-
ing was quietly moved to 10 p. m.
without any public notice.

whom were former Cabinet Minis-
ters—regardless of normal court pro-
cedures. They had all stood trial in
Ghana in 1963, before the Chief Jus-
tice, Sir Arku Korsah. Two were then
found guilty and given capital sen-
tences. The other three (including the
two former Cabinet Ministers) were
acquitted. Dr. Nkrumah thereupon
dismissed the Chief Justice, declared
the trial before the latter null and
void, and ordered a retrial. Now have
come the capital sentences for all five.

In fairness to the new Chief Jus-
tice, Mr. Justice Sargode-Adoo, who
presided over the retrial, it should be
said that once the jury had found
the five accused guilty of the charges
brought against them, he had no al-
ternative to passing capital sentences.
Such is the law.

Ghaaa has the honor of being the
harbinger of independence for black
Africa—at least for that part of it
under colonial rule at the end of
World) War II. Kwame Nkrumah’s
name will ever be associated with
Ghana’s role in Africa during the past
decade. He should remember that
compassion enhances a reputation
much more lastingly than can savage
vindictiveness.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

I see no way, nor have I heard

it defended for this reason.
How does this law hurt higher

education in North Carolina?

. There are several obvious el-

fects:

(1) It indicates and fosters

a lack of confidence in edu-
cators and administrators of
our colleges and universities.

(2) It makes North Caro-
lina's colleges and univer-
sities unattractive to many
top-flite teachers and re-
searchers who might other-
wise accept employment in
North Carolina.

(3) It reduces the number

Soph Urges Great Change:
‘Abolish Dance Weekends'

Dear Editor:

It. has been pointed out re-
peatedly in most of the David-
son publications that the ‘dance
weekends” are times of wanton
abandonment of responsibility
and morality.

One could scarcely deny that
such an accusation applies to
the majority of Davidson ‘‘gen-
tlemen.” How can a Christian
college with avowed Christian
instructors allow such behavior
to be associated with its good
name?

OUTLET NEEDED

Now there is an obvious need
for an outlet of the tensions and
frustrations which confound the
student of the most demanding
school in the South, namely
Davidson. The Davidson student
gets sick and tired of studying
and of wandering about this iso-
lated campus.

Until the present, probably the
main source of getting rid of
academic stagnation-has been
the dance, weekends with their
Tevelry and drunkenness. But
now it is time to ré-evaluate our
means of blowing off steam just
as athletics, fraternities, etc. are
being scrutinized.

The society in which the Da-
vidson gentleman lives is far

from the ideal of freedom and
equality, and to the contrary is
afflicted with many cancerous
social problems. One of the chief
sores is the treatment which the
American Negro receives in re-
gard to his legal rights.

Being both Christians and cit-
izens of this nation, the students
of Davidson have an unquestion-
able responsibility to help solve
‘these problems, especially that
of the Negroes in Davidson's
own part of the country.

A PROPOSAL

I have a proposal to solve
both problems. A racial change
should be brought about in which
“dance weekends” would be
abolished and replaced with
“demonstration weekends.” Un-
der this system the Davidson
gentleman could remain a model
of responsible Chrisianity in-
stead of periodically losing ail
restraint and falling headlong in-
to sin and corruption .

However, his needs to release
his tensions and escape confines
of a closed academic society
would be met as he fought the
good fight for equality of all
American Christians. Banners
nd signs would be much cheap-
er than combos and Julie Lon-
don anyway.

FROM THE BACK OF THE BUS

‘They Are Professionals
Hired To Play Basketball’

By CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

The game is called basketball, and we all love

it.

It has carried the name of our little college to
newspaper readers across the breadth of this na-
tion. (Were it not for basketball, New York Times
readers would know of our schoo! only because of
the anachronistic faculty vow.)

Twice each week we students have followed
our hired hardwood heroes to brightly-lit amphi-

theaters to watch them take apart

lesser bands of

hired hardwood heroes—and shout and scream—
and abuse referees—and sweat when games were
close—and share the glory of one of the nation’s

better basketball teams.

They are professionals in all but the size of the

salaries they are paid to play the game. If we see
the basketball players as professionals, it is easier
to understand, though not condone, the action of
of one when he rebuffs a hero-worshipping young-
Ster asking for an autograph.

In a recent column in the Charlotte News, John
Kilgo took to task an unnamed Wildcat who harshly
turned down a young fan twice during a Coliseum
appearance. It is unfortunate that every athlete can-
not live up to his sportswriter-concocted reputation
as a nice guy.

In a month, perhaps sooner, it will all be done,
the good and the bad, The sports page glory will
also slip swiftly away; we will once again be stu-
dents at a small, southern, church-related college
for men and they will edge a bit closer to the ranks
of ordinary mortals. Which is as it should be at an
institution whose business is education and not bas-
ketball.

_ We wonder whose interest Col. Outlaw had in
mind when he advised seniors in the advanced-
ROTC program not to talk to sophomores about the
advanced program unless they could speak well of
it.
_ In the next few weeks, the sophomores enrolled
in the basic program will be deciding whether to
sign up for the advanced program and commit them-
selves to a brief career as a reserve army officer.

We would think it in the best interests of both
the sophomores and the army to have this decision
made with all the facts available, facts that will
best be drawn out from a frank discussion over the
merits of the program, facts that may be undiscov-
ered until too late if sophomores are presented
with the facts only by an army that needs capable
leaders.

A banishing of Col. Outlaw’s rush-week attitude
toward the advanced program recruiting would prob-
ably result in fewer men nearing army duty with the
sinking feeling that they were unfairly trapped,
and fewer poorly-motivated army officers.

Perhaps Queens and Johnson
C. Smith students could be in-
vited to join in glorious marches
hrough nearby cities, and those
who really have strong tensions
could fight heartless police and
their vicious dogs.

On those weekends which have
no Saturdy classes, the IFC
funds (if such still exist) could
be, used to charter buses and

trains for freedom rides through
Alabama and Mississippi. The
possibilities are endless and af-
ter the race problem—disarma-

of speakers who will come
to North Carolina campuses;
speakers who are not com-
munist, but who protest this
means of fighting commun-
ism by destroying democ-
ratic principles, and

(4) It reduces, for the
same reason as in (3), the
number of learned societies
which will be willing to hold
their meetings on campuses
in North Carolina.

Other effects could be cited,
but these ought to make clear
the fact that this law lowers the
quality of higher education in
North Carolina.

NO HELP

Now. how does this law pro-
mote democratic principles and
deter communisni? Again, I see
to way in which the law ac-
complishes such goals. On the
surface it may appear to do so,
but a closer look suggests that
it really has no such effect.

It adds nothing to existing
laws which prevent communist
teachers in North. Carolina's
schools. It does nothing to pre-
vent formation of communist
cells on campus.

It does nothing to cope with
communists who are not recog-
nized as such; those who work
“‘tinderground’ and disguise
their purposes. It does nothing
to improve social, economic and
political conditions which make
communism attractive to some.

BAN “TEARS DOWN”

In fact, the law tears down
democratic principles and ac-
tually aids communism in sev-
eral ways:

(1) It says, in effect, that
communism is so appealing,

e on at least two major ob-

so superior to democracy
that our young people will
be “‘converted” if allowed
to Msten to its exponents.

(2) It shelters our young
people and prevents their
having first-hand experience
with avowed communists;
its leaves our young people
unprepared for the day when
they will meet such people
in Chicago, New York, Ko-
rea, Vietnam, Paris, Rio de
Janerio or Mexico City.

(3) It leaves communistic
ideas unexposed to the criti-
cism, the refutation. the
pointing out of weaknesses
which they typically receive
at the hands of college audi-
ences.

(4) It enhances the ap-
peal of communism; com-
munism is made to seem at-
tractive because it is ‘‘for-
bidden”’.

(5) It suggests that the
democratic process really
can't cope with communism;
that we must adopt com-
munistic tactics if we are
to win, and, in the process,

(6) It destroys a large
part of what we are trying
to protect: freedom of
thought and speech.

Perhaps I have overlooked
valid arguments in favor of the
Speaker-ban law: perhaps there
are ways in which it improves
the quality of higher education
in North Carolina, promotes
democratic principles and deters
communism.

If so, I would like to know
about it. In the meantime, I urge
everyone who reads this to act
in all honorable ways to bring
about the repeal of this law.

SOUFFLE STILL FALLS FLAT

‘Carnival’ Production Uses
Top Quality Ingredients

BY HANSFORD EPES
A Davidsonian Review

Jean Anouilh’s Thieves’ Carnival has been described as a “souffle”’—appar-
ently because it is light, airy, enjoyable and not particularly nourishing.

Last night, in Hodson Hall,
the recipe for a souffle was fol-
lowed to the letter, and nearly
all of the ingredients were of
top quality. Costumes were
striking, with the colors well
combined for stage ensemble;
the sets were excellent. The
Drama Department even built
its own furniture—narrow, to
conserve space, but with the
skillful illusion of more ordi-
nary size.

The music composed for the
comedy made a great contri-
bution to its atmosphere. One
does wonder why the stage wa-
gon was used, since its small
size often cramped the action
(to the point that the people run-
ning off stage occasionally had
to pause at the edge, waiting to
be stopped). The wagon’s echo-
ing response to every footstep
also tends to be most distracting.

Acting was, for the most part,
very good—though a few actors
gave the distinct impression of
having memorized their inflec-
tions as well as their lines,
without really knowing what they
were saying or why. Those in
major roles were, however, con-
vincing: Jon Miller's flawless

representation of senility as
Lord Edgard, Ellen Winkler’s
bored but regal bearing—and
her mastery of British accent—
as Lady Hurf, Pete Myers’
stage presence and comic skill
as Hector.

Sylvia Campbell started slow-
ly as the young Juliette, but
picked up markedly after inter.
mission: and Laura Ann Stev-
ens (Eva) certainly has a way
with a scarf.

Dennis Phillips, as Peterbono,
had several good moments but
tended to be uneven: and the
Dupont-Duforts (Rawley Turi
ner and Marvin Sparrow) al-
lowed an old vaudeville routine
—funny the first dozen or so
times — to get in the way of
otherwise good acting.

Sometimes, bowever, the re-
cipe can be followed and the
souffle can still fall flat. Very
few actors really seemed to
have their hearts in the whole
affair. The tempo dragged, often
painfully.

The comedy in the situation
was usually lacking: an audi-
ence that should have been con-
sistently enjoying itself merely

chuckled appreciatively from
time to time at incidents, not -
at the comedy itself. Most of
the farcial ‘‘business’* was over-
done; for example, Hector’s at-
tempt, through gestures, to help
Peterbono out of a tight spot,
or the accidental baby-snatch-
ing routine in Act One—a suc-
cessful attempt to get one ex-
tra giggle which Anouilh hadn't
thought of.

In short: overacting or, more
properly, memorized fun can-
not substitute in comedy for the
real thing: well-done details
cannot cover ‘up for a lack of
unity in a production.

Anouilh says it well himself
(via his translator): “It's only
for those who have played it
with zest that the comedy is a
success.”

Much of the dragging. many
of the faults, could be the nor-
mal hazards of the first night—
but other things are not. Per-
haps the next farce—The Bald
Soprano—will be a different
story. At any rate, there is an-
other performance of Thieves’
Carnival on Saturday afternoon
—see it for yourself. It's amus-
ing.
