Red and Black Freshmen
Finish Successful Year

Hewleté and Anderson Lead Team
in Scoring

The Davidson Freshmen finished their

1924 season successfuly, having won nine and_

lost two games.

This being the first Fresh basketball team
that the college has had, its progress was
watched with interest and everyone féels sat-
isfied with this year’s showing. Although
there was some doubt in a few minds as to
whether a Fresh team would be a liability
or not, the receipts of this season have com-
fortably covered all the expenses incurred.

The ‘scores of the games are as follows:

Davidson___----- 62 Greensboro High- 18

Red and Black Cagers
End Season With Wins

Belmont and Statesville Go Down
Before Wildcats

Coach Younger’s Red and Black quint
wound up its 1923 season by defeating Bel-
mont and Statesville.

Belmont Game

The Davidson Wildcats, playing their next
to the last game of the basketball season
Monday night, February 25th, in Belmont,
defeated the snappy aggregation from that
city, the score being 33 to 28. The Belmont
defenders got off to a good start, outplaying
the Davidson boys in the first half, which
ended 14-10 in their favor. This half was
slow and void of interest, but Coach Monk
sent the Wildcats back fighting mad, and
business began to pick up for the Davidson
contenders in the second half. Davidson
made 23 points during this period, while Bel-
mont was chalking up 14, the final score end-
ing 33-28 in the Wildcats’ favor.

Staley played a better game in this contest
than he had for several games past, making
16 points, while Laird was a runner-up with
eight. The,Belmont players divided honors,
T. Leper making eight points, while Aber-
nathy made six and P. Leper made seven.

Statesville Game

Davidson’s cage season ended last Thurs-
day night with a decisive victory over the
Statesville Athletic Association, 44 to 13.
Playing on their home floor, the Wildcats
dazzled Statesville with a brilliant display of
team work, and hit the basket with unerring
accuracy.

Led by Staley, who piled up 16 points to
his credit, the Red and Black machine gain-
ed an early lead, and the outcome was never
in doubt after a few minutes of play. The
first half ended with the scoreboard reading
22 to 10.

For the Association quint the work of
Hartness and Sipley was outstanding. Hart-
ness scored six markers and Sipley four, and
both played an excellent game on defence.
Statesville fought stubbornly, and at times
showed flashes of splendid team work, but
failed to hit the basket when opportunity
was presented.

The Dope Fiend

By W. F. Galloway

The Fresh romp off with the state cham-
pionship. Sounds good for the years to
come.

The Court of Control isn’t functioning
much if they can’t hold the Freshmen down.

a |
The Fresh ran up 304 points—not bad for |
the games they played.

V. M. IL, 21; Davidson, 0, sounds
enough, but the V. M. I. beat Army.

It was the defeat at Carolina that hurt.

bad

Carolina looks like they are going: good in
Atlanta. By the time the old paper rolls off
the press they will have either won or lost.

Cobb, of Carolina, is the big gun. How
does 292 this year to date sound—72 were
fouls and 110 field goals. Sounds good.

Wake Forest has 110 men out for base-
ball. The Wildcats don’t usually need but
nine.

“T. F.” Staley leads off the team in scor-
ing—176 points.

Time to pull out the tennis rackets, too.
Reports are that a meet with Colgate is on
tap for the hill.

“Jethro” Koenig is back on the hill in
time to limber up for track. Koenig has
been” home for a rest cure.

Too bad the State basketball meet fell
through. ‘

D. Benton Wharton asked us to announce
that Smithfield beat New Bern 24-12. It is
rather unusual.

It's good-bye basketball, so long wrestling,
how-de-do baseball, hello track, good morn-
ing tennis.

After the game Friday night between
the Concord and Davidson girls, a ban-
quet was served at Mrs. Shelton’s for
the two teams. The members of the
Davidson freshman team were also the
guests of Mrs, Shelton

Freshmen Win Final
Games By Wide Margins

Wofford and Mooresville Fall Before
Yearling Onslaught

Coach Rawson’s Wildkittens wound up
their schedule last week, winning the final
contests from the Wofford Fresh and
Mooresville High by topheavy scores.

Wofford Game

Last Friday night the Davidson Freshman
team snowed the Wofford Freshmen under
to the tune of 41-18, in a somewhat slow and
listless game. During the first half every-
thing was Davidson, but during the last part
of the second half the visitors picked up as
they became better accustomed to the floor
and Lady Luck smiled for a time on their
efforts to cage the ball. The result of the
game was never in doubt, Davidson seeming
to score almost at will. Davidson’s offense
was working to perfection and their capable
pair of guards held the scoring of the op-
posing team down very well.

Anderson was the best player for David-
son, as high-score man contributing 21 points
to the victory, and playing a fine floor game.
Also, Simpson did some stellar work at guard
for the home team. For Wofford the honors
go to Habel, captain, playing at forward.

Mooresville Game

Monday night the Davidson Freshman
team won over Mooresville High School, 47
to 30.

The game was played at Mooresville and
was characterized throughout by fast, speedy
playing. The Davidson team led by a small
score in the first half, but gained a decided
advantage in the last period.

Sapp was high-point man for Davidson,
but both Simpson and Anderson showed good
work, Hudgins at center played a reliable
game, although not scoring but twice. For
Mooresville, Captain Hartness showed good
form as well as Evans and Mills.

the team well. He was ever fighting and ac-
counted for 65 of the Davidson points.
Boggs, one of the best guards in the state,
only shot 30 points, but his guarding cut off
many sure shots by opposing forwards and
prevented several victories being turned into
defeats. McConnell and Sapp divided hon-
ors for the position of running guard; the
former showing up exceptionally well in his
second year of basketball at Davidson, and
caged 55 points; the latter found the ring
for 56 tallies. Beall, Mallory and Hewlett
divided the remaining 23 points.
