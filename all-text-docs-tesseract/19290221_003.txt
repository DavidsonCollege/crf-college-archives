Lynchburg Hornets No Match for
Red and Black Team

In the final game of their northern
invasion the Davidson Wildcats downed
the «Lynchburg College Hornets at
Lynchburg, 33-17.

The Wildcats had won two and lost
three games on their trip until the
Lynchburg game which sérved to even
things up and make it an even split
with the Northerners.

Davidson opened the
rush, piling up 15 points before Lynch-
burg registered. This was practically
the margin by which the Wildcats won.
The but was
closely guarded on both sides. After
Lynchburg started to score the contest
was on more even terms, but the Wild-
cat's lead was too big for the Hornets

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Here's hoping that the varsity got all its losses
out of its’system during those three successive
nights in Virginia. This week is going to be
the final thrust of the Wildcats at the state
title, and though most of the newspapers al-
ready assign the laurels to Carolina, there is
no dodging the fact that Davidson is still a most
dangerous team, and one which can very easily
throw a crip into the works,

The Cats had a schedule which was un-
favorable to a steady drive for the state
title. Most of their games are coming right
now when all other Big Five teams have met
and the race is considered over by most
authorities. If Davidson had been allowed
to meet her Big Five competitors earlier in
the season, we believe that the state race
would be in a vastly different situation now,
and that the Wildcats would be in a very
threatening position.

It was mighty hard to drop that game with

V. M. IL. by acsingle oint. Just goes to show
what a whale of a difference a point or so
makes. You can’t see a season through without
some bad breaks, though, and so there’s not

much use lamentjng the loss... The Washing-
ton andLee Generals were victors by the in-
disputable right of the strongest. The
als are stirring up all sorts of trouble in the
Southern Conference this year, and are favored
by many to cop the title. We attribute the loss
to Virginia more to the weariness of the team
than anything else, and we hardly think that

The various classes seem to be responding well to Captain Pritchett’s

call for boxing aspirants, and before many moons, the thud of gloves will be

heard as the boys struggle for class honors.

There is not an abundance of

material here for boxing, but there are several very good men who give

promise of future development.
