The Second Century...

Davidson College can now look back with

—~a great deal of Satisiaction over its tirst one
hundred years of servite. Still more can it
look forward to one hundred years of even
greater service. .

Innumerable advantages stand out—more
directly applicable to the 1937-38 year. Dav-
idson College now has the largest enroll-
ment in the history of the school. Nor is it
a mere mouey array of students. The pres-
ent freshman class is the best by actual sta-
tisties in ate History of freshmati classes.
Thus the College has a better type of men
with which to start this second century.

Davidson College has an even greater en-
dowment than ever before. Without some
form of backing capital, any such institution
is ineapable of maintenance. Campaigning
is rapidly taluag care of all wants and needs
in the way of building funds.

With an ecxcelient administration and
iaculty, augmented by much needed new
men, Davidson College has the backbone

/ necessary to carry on with excellent teach- ,
ing and maintenance.

But#even more than these things of a
material nature, the spit oi Davidson will
continue to grow and thrive with every
added vear. Davidson can well look back
with pride mpon the past century and look
forward to a century of stil! greater

?
progress! . -

Our Policies...
As the first issue of the 1937-38 David-
sonian comes off the press, we think -ie
“ appropos that our readers know something
oi the editerial plans and policies of this
newsoapert.
Incorporated iw the mast head are the
words “Published weekly ‘For a Better Dav-
idson’.” We can tind no betrer general aim,
but there stil remain otaer factors jn this
poliey, We of the stafi wish to do two
things during the year. First, we wish to
publish a paper thai will interest and please
the students, faculty and others affiliated
with the College. Second, we hope to put
~out a weekly that will rate well in the na-
tion. The Davidsonian in the past has done
both of these to some extent, but there is,
always room for improvement-—
A member of last year’s graduating class
made this ail too true statement: “it seems
to me that the true worth and interest of
The Davidsonian OUGHT to lie in the edi-
torial page. The rest of the paper merely
serves as a record for events.” And that
senior was absolutely correct in his state-
ment. It is difficult to fill a weekly with a
great deal of real “news.” Not that the
paper should not eke out every bit oi news
available. We are not trying to excuse our=
selves irom giving you the news. In the,
future, we want to cut the stories of past
events as much as possible and ‘give you
news and lots of it.

But evidently the greatest intérest in the
paper lies in the editorial side. During the
coming year, we hope to give you a suc-

cessor to “Sweeping the Campus” that will
satisfy the most avid keyhole fiends on the
campus. Your gossip column will’ not be
mud-slinging by any means but on the other
hand we expect to cover the social activi-
ties and inclinations on the hill.

Your movie cotumn will continue. >with
improvements, sports editor Marquess, will
carry on with his weekiy column, and
“Among the Grecks” wit! continue ta report
the news of the fraternities.

Replacing “Campus Comments.” we offer
a stati column conducted weckly by the va-
rious editors on The Davidsonian. Not only
will this give you varied opinions on local
and national happenings. but the staffers

will have an additional opportunity to show:

their worth as newspaper men. To gather
even more diverse opinions into the editorial
sheet, open. torum letters will be welcomed
and a greater number published aceording
io the diseretion of the editor.

The Davidsonian ‘nas often been criticized
ior being too iignt in nature. For that rea-
son and to seitle any complaints, we intend
to use More editorials that deal seriously
with campus events and as much as possible
events of state and national interest.

The Davidsonian is planning to put every
bit into the paper that is humanly possible.
And we expect the student body to do the
same. The paper means nothing without
the co-operation of each individual student.
Any suggestions are welcomed. Let's use

our paper to°“make a better Davidson.”

students have trekked to the Infirmary tp
have her treat evervthing irom athlete’s foot
to streptoeoccic throats.

Upperclassmen will remember with pleas-
ure the great help she has been, rendering
unseltish service at all times. For such
service as this she was awarded the Alger-
non Sullivan Sydney Award some years ago.

For years she has dreamed oi new in-
tirmary., adequately equipped to meet the
aeeds of the students. Now that that in-

tirmafy nears completion, she has decided
to step out of the picture. But she will be
missed by her patients. the students with
whom she would joke as they awaited the
doctor’s visit to make them forget how aw-
iull¥ sick they thought they were.

But she has grown to tove Davidson as
we all do. and she will stay here in our midst
to watch young boys come to college and
young men go out into the world.

With The Staff —

The nine social, iraternities here on the
campus have jast come through the most
strenuons and hectie part of the whole sehool

year.. Rushing season has come and gone.
and ‘one glanee at any fraternity man tells
a story of long nights when he sat with his
brothers and weighed the merits of the
prospective pledges.

But that is all a thing o7 the past now, and
every one breathes.a sigh of relief as he set-
tles down to the normal serenity of life on
the cloistered Datidson campus. Now that
age-old question of a fraternity’s value
arises again.

It has been said time and again that a
man can get out of a Iraternity only as much
as he puts into it. The sayinig still holds
true. The association with one's brothers
ean do much to deveiop. his qualities of lead-
ership. broadmindedness, and poise. Through
a iraternity can be made contacts which will
prove useful and enjoyable as long as the
man lives, It provides a common ground
on which lasting iciendships can be formed.

Thus it'can be seen that a iraternity man
has some advantage over others, not be-
cause of the pin that he wears on his vest
but because of the many things his lodge has
déne for him in his four years in college.

There is one charge often made against
fraternities and iraternity men, that oi
snobbishness. Every one of these men nat-
urally thinks that his lodge is the best on
the campus, in the country, and even in the
whole world, else he would not have joined
it. That is what is known as iraternity
spirit. But this can be carried so far and
then it becomes snobbishness, When a man
comes to the point where he looks down on
another because he wears no pin or a dif-
ierent badge on his chest, he has lost the
spirit of the thing. In other words, a ira-
ternity cannot make men — it takes men to
build a fraternity—-OVID BELL.

Our social life has always been

difficulties, Davidson dances have,
nevertheless, always set high stand-

in which students have held them
are witnessed by the large number
of sisters and cousins who come to
every weck-end. Many parents and
faculty members have been welcome
guests at these functions. While
