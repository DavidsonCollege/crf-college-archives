and difficult. And every year, tudents
go out from Davidson better prepared
to grapple with the moral prol‘ems of
life because they have taken the courses
in Philosophy under him.

It is due to the efforts of Dr. Sentelle
that the absence system works. And
though almost any student would be glad
if he personally could escape the results
of this work, all realize that this system
and its rigid enforcement play a large
part in the discipline that makes Da-
vidson what it is.

At every point at which he touches
the life of the college, Dr. Sentelle is
a force for the good of the whole struc-
ture. His careful, accurate fairness. in
marking his students has made an im-
pression upon all who have taken courses
under him; his willingness to help has
made for him an enduring place in the
hearts of all who have known him.

The other night

I came home

And it was late
And the place
Was very dark
With lots of trees
And shadows too.
I ran against
Something white
And then it moved
And I saw

That it was

A large white dog.
Very soon

You will be
Rambling along
And run against
A large white sheet
With lots of names
And I hope

That your name
Will be absent
From that fateful
Word above for
All those names
Spelled “Deficient”
So now is when
To start aright

A genial golfer on being admitted to
heaven greeted St. Peter with the ques-
tion: “I suppose you have the best of
links here and that | will now be able
to play to my heart's content?”

Said Mr. Peter: ‘I'm awfully sorry,
sir, but we have none. Our guests do
not indulge in such idle pastime. How-
ever, you probably can find ‘suitable
links down below where most of the
sports go.”

Down went the genial golfer to Old
Nick, who showed hiny a most wonder-
ful course and a noble club house. Sa-
tan even went so far as to provide the
lacking outfit of clubs, It was not many
minutes before our geod friend, the golf-
er, felt he could drive a ball two hun-
dred and fifty yards or more with the
perfect drive that had been handed him.
So he asked the caddy for balis. To his
suprise the latter shook his head.

Turning to Old Nick the new comer
ejaculated: ‘What! no balls?”

Sadly the “Old Boy” replied, “No;
that’s the hell of ie!’—The Sphinx
Talks.

THINK WHAT HE MISSED!

“When I told her I killed a German
with one hand, she grabbed it and kissed
it all over.”

“You're an idiot,” said his pal. “Why
didn’t you tell her you bit the Hun to
death?”
