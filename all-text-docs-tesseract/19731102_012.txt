Senate Endorses Checkpoint
For New E. H. Little Library

By HARRIETT HODGES
News Editor

The student Senate voted to

of a checkpoint in the
new Little Library in Tuesday’s
meeting

This would mean that there
would be someone to check
books as they are taken out of
the library, according to the
Senate recommendation.

Chairman of the Committee
on Co-Education Sue Cun-
ningham reported on the work
She is doing to get the com-
mittee started.

“I’ve been talking to people in
the P. E. department about
proficiency requirements. Also,
I've talked to Dr. Bevan about
the number of women
professors,’’ she said.

Cunningham said that she
was also talking to members of
the administration about the
possibility of more women’s
studies. This would include
courses such as women in
history and women in
literature.

The Senate heard a report
from Lee Grogan on his
meeting with Director of Ad-
missions H. Edmunds White.
‘‘Mr. White said that ad-
missions are up a great deal
this year. It will be about the
hardest that it ever was to get in
Davidson this year,"’ Grogan
said.

Grogan added that White was
afraid that the toughness of
competition for places in next
year’s freshman class would
lower the number of ap-
plications in following years.

Blain Butner discussed the
work he is doing to set up
faculty advisory committees.

free form brush stroke at the edge of an otherwise open field, much
as Newman did with the hard-edge line.

X radiates out from the center. The effect is

There are no longer any limitations. In the ‘Target’ paintings by
Kenneth Noland, the corners become an issue because of the
relationship of the circle to the square support, but in paintings bo
Jackson Pollock and Mark Tobey there is an all over movement
that defies the usual directional analysis.

I do not wish to offer the Roman numerals as.a set scheme for
looking at pictures, nor to suggest that pictures are made in a
direct response to it; however, I am suggesting that they are one of
the early systems we all have in common, and that exploring their
visual aspects may lead to a training of the eye, which for the pain-
ter is learning to see.

... Free Speech

(Continued from page 7)

trial was necessary to determine the acceptability of each item.

Criteria were established: (1) freedom of the press was protec-
ted by the first amendment to the constitution, and that (2) an ex-
pert may attempt to convince a jury that the accused item has
some form of ‘‘redeeming social value’’.

This gave local areas the responsibility to establish the
guidelines, but it gave the “literature’’ a chance to be defended by
experts.

On June 2ist of this past summer, the new Berger Supreme
Court ruled on five obscenity/pornography cases .

In these decisions (which are available in the Government
Documents Section of the College Library) an entirely new set of
guidelines was established.

The first major change was the fact that no longer did the court
consider obscene material protected by the First Amendment.
Also, a work may be subject to state regulation where the work
“‘taken as a whole, appeals to the purient interest in sex or appeals
to sex in a pattently offensive way."’

No expert will be allowed to testify about the relative merits of
the work, a local jury will decide just by perusing the text and pic-
tures.

The jury may decide the item is obscene, then, if in their opinion
it does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
values.

Furthermore, if the state law is written on these basic guidelines,
any decisions by a jury may not be appealed to a higher court!

On the face of it, the high moral tone of the decision sounds wor-
thy of commendation. But on further examination you will find the
contrary.

' In recent days, reports are coming in that local areas are
requiring book stores to rid their shelves of materials jurors con-
sider not appropriate for local citizens, their fellow citizens, to see.

But the consequences go further still. The public library presents
the greatest initial concern. The lawyers for the Los Angeles Public
Library said that they could not offer any consolation or legal com-
fort to the staff.

A library who checked-out to a patron a book which is con-
judged obscene by a local jury could be cited in violoation of the law
and prosecuted!

Similarly, if a citizen takes a book off-the-shelves which is con-
sidered obscene (a book which might have been added to the
library collection before the court’s decision or a jury’s rulings)
and reads it in the library, then the library administration could be
held guilty of providing obscene material and be prosecuted!

As citizens of an academic institution and citizens of a city at
home, we have a responsibility to stand up for freedom of speech,
inquiry, and opinion - to support educated selection, not censorship.

An academic community has a responsibility to investigate all
ideas, i.e. not to censor but to select from those ideas, theories, and
opinions which are available for consideration.
