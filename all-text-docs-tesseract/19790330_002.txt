2 Davidsonian— March 30, 1979

"By PETE HUX
+ Staff Writer

Only eight students attended
an open forum held in Chambers
Gallery Tuesday to discuss the
pros and cons of switching to a
semester system at Davidson.

The day before, a faculty
committee established to weigh
the differences ‘between the
current trimester system and a
possible semester system, spon-
sored an open forum for profes-
sors. About.35 to 40 were
present.

Religion professor David
Kaylor, chairman of the com-
mittee, emphasized, ‘‘The esta-
blishment of this committee is
not in response to any overri-
ding crisis.” He indicated that
those faculty members present
favored a move to a semester
system. However, he noted it
was natural for faculty mem-
bers in favor of the present
system.to miss the meeting.

Kaylor was careful.to point
out that both the systems in
question have attendant advan-
tages and disadvantages. Gra-
duation requirements stand to
be affected by a possible change
to semesters. Currently 36
course credits -are required for
graduation, but a change to
semesters woule require either a
decrease to 32 course credits or
an increase to 40. This results
from the fact that a semester
system would require students
to be enrolled in either four or
five courses per fifteen-week
semester.

However, a change to a
semester hour program could
require students to earn a
certain. number of semester
hours to be eligible for gradua-
tion. Kaylor mentioned,
though, that there was not
much faculty endorsement of
this idea.

The chief argument for the:
semester system was that there
would be more time for thé
curriculum to sink into the
students’ heads. It was argued
that the present system does
not allow the “percolation ef-
fect’’ to occur.

Brown grant to endow professorship

By JOHN SIMAN
Staff Correspondent

The College has received a $375,000 challenge grant from the
Brown Foundation of Houston to help endow a professorship. The
College must match the Foundation’s grant by November 1983 to
establish the Herman Brown Chair in Natural Science with an
endowment of $750,000. The announcement was made through the
Office of Development.

The Brown Foundation is among the 30 largest philanthropic
organizations in the nation. Its founders, present Foundation
President George Brown and the late Herman Brown founded the
large Brown 9 Root Construction Company in’Texas.

Development officer Allan Lee said that the work of several
Davidson alumni living in the Houston area was instrumental in
convincing the Foundation to consider making a large endowment
to Davidson, since the Foundation usually makes grants within
Texas.

Foundation officials and College President Samuel Spencer then
met in May 1978 to discuss possible endowments. After College
representatives submitted a formal proposal for use of an
endowment in late September, the Foundation informed the
College of its $375,000 challenge grant on Novermber 30.

The endowment was given as part of the fundraising efforts of
the Davidson 1987 Program.

Lee explained the importance of endowments, which become
College assets providing long term constant income: ‘‘There is no
doubt that endowments will be a make or break factor for many
private colleges and universities.”” Though Lee emphasized that
Davidson is quite sound financially, he pointed out that as prices
rise, it becomes more and more difficult to count on student fees
and annual alumni gifts to cover expenditures. Endowments can
provide the funds to allow private colleges to keep their costs to
students competitive with those of public colleges.

Davidson presently has an endowment of $20 million and hopes
to increase it to $39 million by 1987. Thus $19 million of the
Davidson 1987 Program’s $35 million target is expected to come
from endowments in general and there is a $6.5 million target

specificially for faculty endowments, such as the one made by the

Brown Foundation.
