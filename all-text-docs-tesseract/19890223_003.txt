Thursday, February 23, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

FORUM, from page 1

Davidson College.’ No one believes you
until they see this ID. That’s ridiculous to
me. There’s no excuse in my mind for that
type of problem.”

Miller “left town” in the fall of 1985
when the Ku Klux Klan marched through
downtown Davidson. “I guess it’s so easy
to forget that there are racial problems here
because you’re studying all the time--until
it’s put in your face.”

Black students also asserted that subtle
racism persists in their rapport with whites.
According to Bynum, “Needless to say, a
‘large percentage of our white student popu-
lation has never had to greatly interact with
a black person on meaningful level, so
needless to say, unfortunately our students

are clinging to a lot of stereotypes which

again is only natural that they would be
there,”

According to professor of philosophy
Julio Ramirez, the minority has a dual role
as student and educator. “There will -be
stereotypes--therefore it requires a break-
ing of barriers.”

Bruce resents being asked if he is an
athlete upon first meeting someone. One
black female remembers when:a hallmate
asked to ‘use her white “toommate’s”
microwave, assuming that it belonged to
the latter. The black student. graciously
replied, “Yes, you can use my microwave.”

What about qualifications? Joy Gray, a
freshman from Long Island, NY, says she
does not feel.as if she has to prove her
merits: “I walk out of my room with my
head up high because I know that I deserve
to be here as well as anyone else.”

At the same time, some white students
stated that they were unaware of the sensi-
tivities which blacks perceive, and as far as
making friends outside of the classroom

_ wasconcerned, that they did not know how:

to approach black people. As one student in
the documentary stated, “How can I be
friendly without offending someone? I
have a fear of saying something which may
be perceived as prejudiced.”

Senior Maureen Harris responded to the
statement of how to meet blacks. “I don’t
want someone to make friends with me
because I’m black. I want them to like me
because of who I am--Maureen Harris--and
what I’ve done. Just respect me.”

Donna Peters, a senior from Birming-
ham, AL, stated that she felt she had not
“been granted the opportunity” to get to
know black students, adding that the forum
exposed her to experiences of which she

was unaware.

Several black students also discussed
their reasons for not belonging to eating
houses, citing discomfort as the primary
reason. Yet there were other experiences.
Although sophomore Ingrid Page is a for-
mer member of a girl’s eating house, she
stated, “‘I still love the people at Spencer.”

Page says she is able to economize by
eating selective meals at the Commons and
the Union Cafe. A non-drinker, she
strongly believes that her money should not.
support the purchase of beer, which the
majority of the Patterson Court serves.

Jana Player, a freshman, is a member of
Spencer eating house and feels “very wel-
come” there. “Each student has their
proper perspective,” she stated. Respond-
ing to one student who said that they did not
feel welcome, she asserted that generaliza-
tions cannot be made of the experiences of
all black students.

Other students expressed their discom-
fort at Court parties, where the majority of
time
amounts of alcohol, and where they knew

The discussion continued as a white stu-
dent asked Bruce if he knew what Davidson
would be like before enrolling. Said Bruce,
“When I came here I didn’t really come in
contact with white students.” His hosts
were black.

Parker responded by saying that the
mistake of Bruce’s visit was the format--
the now extinct Minority Weekend. All
accepted students are now invited to visit

the college on SGA weekend in order to
perceive Davidson exactly as it is.

The forum ended, although groups of
black and white students lingered to ask
each other--’Well, what do I do when
someone, (usually drunk) tells a racist
joke?”--"I feel as if all eyes are on me when
I’m the only black in the class.”--”’Whites
don’t talk about black heritage. It seems as
if blacks are separating themselves when
they say it’s so important.”
