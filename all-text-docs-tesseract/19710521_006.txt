LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

Last Thursday afternoon
(May 13), representatives of
those fraternities desiring to
set up eating and/or living
facilities off-campus met with
the Student Life Committee
of the Trustees in hopes that
the trustees might be con-
vinced to delete Article Seven
from the new social plan in-
stituted last fall, which for-
bids such action.

The argument did not in
volve the issue of the inher-
ent good or evil of selectivi-
ty. Rather, the represent-
atives assumed. that there
were different. beliefs con-
cerning se'ectiyity due to
personal ideals, and argued
instead about their rights as
Davidson College Students.

It seems only fair and just
that fraternity members be
granted the same rights as
any other students regarding
where they are going to
eat or live.

College regulations require
that freshmen eat in the col-
lege union cafeteria, but levy
no restrictions whatsoever on
where or with whom upper-
classmen eat.

In regards to where a stu-
dent is to live, it has been
the practice in the past to
grant upperclassmen special
permission to live , off-cam-
pus according to whether or
not they have places to live
and according to how many
dormitory spaces are avail-
' able.

To deny. these rights, to
fraternity . members _ solely
because they are fraternity
members is blatantly dis-
criminatory.

It is logical and justifiable
for the college to discontinue
subsidizing a_ selective so-
cial system. when it has de

cided to direct its policy
against selectivity. Certainly
the college would be foolish
to do otherwise. Fraternity
members understand _ the
reasoning behind this action,
and do not wish to reverse
the college’s decision.

The fraternity representa
tives found the SLC to be
absolutely intolerant to the
fraternities’ side of the is-
sue. Between childish elbow
nig and snickering between
two of the trustees and muf-
fled reminders that fratern-
ity.men did have to gnaduate,
it became evident that the
trustees had made up their
minds,

That same evening frat-
ernity members showed up

To the Editor:

Last January, the installa-
tion of a Black government
in Greene County, Alabama,
was celebrated as the begin
ning hope and substance for
an authentic’ social and po-
litical movement in - the
South. Before that time,
Black people there had strug-
gled for years to gain a fair
“application of laws and a
peaceful, decent life for their
community.

Now, these basic aspira-
tions have a reality and a
chance to- grow. Still, the
task of continuing this free
way of life and ‘opening up
possibilities in other Black
Belt counties has only begun.

Although the elections are
a year away, in 1972, there
can be no delay in the work
that is necessary to win. Re-
gistration drives, mass
meetings, voter education
projects, canvassing, and
trouble - shooting (prevent-
ing intimidation) are only
the outward, visible kinds of
Activiites that require much
time, people, and funds. In
some Black counties, Sum-
ter’°and Marengo, the spirit

of hope that gives people a
vigilance to go must be re-
kindled.

Friends of Greene County
is an organization which is
designed to raise the re-
sources by which electoral
politics in South Alabama
can improve the lives of peo-
ple.

So that the people of this
region may begin to de
termine their own destiny, I
hope you will aid us in this
cause.

in substantial numbers for
the trustees-student recep-
tion, only to find that the
pitifully few trustees that
bothered to show were gen-
erally close-minded about the
whole fraternity issue.

It was no surprise, then,
when the trustees voted to
reaffirm their former stand
against eating and
facilities for off-campus frat-
ernities.

Neither was the econdmic
situation considered. An off
canypus fraternity system
would create’ no cost pro
blems for the college.

Nor did they consider the
current philosophy of admin-
istrative - student relations,
for such tight controt of stu-

those persons who could en-
danger his leadership. Sev
eral hundred thousand lead
ing persons were killed.

“The development of com-
munism after World War II
showed two opposite faces

a completely closed society
in ‘Russia, and at the same
time the resumption of tthe
original world-wide revolu-
tionary drive."

Once students and other
citizens understand that what
happened in Korea, and what
is happening in Vietnam, are
a part of this conspiracy as
dealt with in perhaps the
most neutral of authorities,

“the Encyclopedia Brittanica,
each current incident will be

seen as a part of an histori-
cal event of great magnitude.

Actually, in Vietnam, A-
merica is fighting Russia,
and China. Now, one other
point. Nixon fell heir to a
nasty wan. If he followed the
party, Rennie Davis (now in
jail for conspiracy to violate
the rights of others), Jerry
Rubin, Hugh Hester, and Pro-
fessor Patterson, he would
act tragically, The conse-
quences may best be pictured
by reducing the war to this

You are fighting a crimi-
nal assassin, because a weak
neighbor called for help.
You have been struggling
with this man im the neigh-
bor’s yard. Other people
come to the scene and waitch.
Some of them say to you
(but not the assassin) ‘‘Tell
this crimnal that you will,
in five minutes, drop your
guard, turn your back, and
walk off—he wont hurt you.”

Would you trust the crim-
nal? Nixon is wise enough
not to. He knows the neigh-

living .

. dént social life is a definite

lapse back to an ‘“‘in loco par-
entis’’ stand,

It is inconceivable that the
college should thus try to
impose its new social sy-
stem on all students. Admit-
tedly, fraternities were not
a viable social, altrenative
for all students. But, like-
Wise, the new social system

will not suit everyone's tastes’

or needs.

Those of Us who are in
fraternities that ~ desire to
move off campus simply do
not feel that we can become
a part of such a system. We
believe that ‘the fraternity
system has been, and will
continue to be, the best one
for us.

stise Trustee Action

We desire only to perpetu-
ate the organizations that
have played very important
parts in our college lives.
Hence, the trustees’ refusal
to show interest in student
opinion or reasoning has
made us become disillusion-
ed, angered, and alienated.

One would think that the
rights of students would fare
better in such a citadel of ©
benevolent liberation. David-
hardly the
place traces of authoritarian
ism should be found, and
fraternity members, accord-
ing to the popular sterotype,
are the last people who
should have to work against
the administration to gain
their rights.

Something is
wrong.
