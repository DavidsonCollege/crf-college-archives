Nomad's Horoscopes

If today is your birthday, so
what.

* *

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19):
If you were an animal you would
bereptilian orsomething that bur-
rows through dirt. Be ready for a
man named Eddy. Taurus would
beincluded ifhe didn’t have better
things to do.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18):
Person will say, “Youhaveacne.”
Focus on benzoyl peroxide and
staying home. If you read your
cards right, you just might be
able to-market your face as a

pizza. |
Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20):
The stars don’t like you. What
- you thought was rain was actu-
ally several constellations wee-
weeing on your head. Jackie
gonna be a football star.
Aries (March 21-April 19):
Diane’s debutante backseat of
Jackie’scar. Spotlighton Zamfir,
master of the pan flute. High-
lighters highlighted.
Taurus (April 20-May 20):
Ifyouhadahammer, you’dham-
mer it inthe moming. You'd

hammer it in the evening. All over
this world.

Gemini (May 21-June 20):
Worms will crawl in your ears
while you sleep, eat your brain,
and bore through your skull by

ry

moming. Don’t worry, they’reonly

worms and need to eat, too. Tin
and noble gases in the picture.
Cancer (June 21-July 22):

I’ve gota héadache this big and it’s
got Excedrin written all over it.
Concentrate on why you are here,
what your career plans are, why
you are here, and what your career
plansare. Rosesare red and bruises
areablack-purplishcolor, Scorpio
is a collection of stars in the sky
and you are not.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22):

Today is your day. Expect the best
of all worlds. But today you will
also vanish from this earth or, at
least, be in an accident involving
garbanzo beans (also known as

‘chick peas), so enjoy it while you

can, Which won't be for long I can
tell you right now.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22):

A booger will sit under your nose
between your nostrils where you
won’ tbe able to see it until you are

getting ready for bed in the eve-
ning at which point, itis too dry to
remove, so you have to wear it for
the rest of your life or get it re-
moved with the risk of also losing
your nose, which would be good
since you’d lose eleven pounds
since you have a big nose.
Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22):
There’s really not much to say
except that what you are doing
right now is stupid and anything
else you do today, tomorrow, or
any day is also stupid. Dentures
in the picture.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov:21):
Islands in the stream, that is what
weare. Nothing in between. How
can we be wrong. Sail away with
me. To another world. And we
rely oneachother. Aa-aa. Islands

-in the stream, that is what we are.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21):
The worldisan egg in your hands.

‘You put the egg in some water in

order to make a hard-boiled egg.

You cook the egg too long. Be-
cause of what you did and be-

cause the world is an egg; you,

therefore, cooked the world too

long. Way to go. Hope you’re
