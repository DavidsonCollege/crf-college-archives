Eating houses

By DAVE SCHMIDT
Staff Writer

With self-selection rapidly app-
roaching, many freshpeople will be
making a decision that will affect
their eating and social habits for the
next three years.

The following is by no means
intended to be a guide to the houses
on Patterson Court. It is simply an
expression by members of each of the
houses about the type of image their
respective houses possess. The state-
ment proceeding the quotes is my
impression of each house that I have
gathered from listening to people talk
about other houses. It’s amazing how
some of these differ from what people
in the houses think.

ATO: Franz Fanon said it best:
“The Wretched of the Earth” (M. F.
Leopold), ‘‘A mixture of secular and
religious. As far as the culinary
aspect is concerned, the food is ‘great,
we have a beer machine, and we cater
to our health-food fanatics. Altruism
through overindulgence.’’ (Jack Gol-
den and Bruce Hoster), ‘‘Our house is
a puppet regime of the CIA, and we
have as our duty to propagate the
teachings of George Bush. We are
also dedicated to the sellout of the
Third World to the Multinational
Corporations.”

PAX: Any house that has daiquiri
parties can’t be all bad. (Mary Hay),
“PAX has a pretty comfortable
atmosphere due to the diverse per-
sonalities and large number of person-
alities. I feel that just about anyone
could fit in.” (Sykes McCord), “PAX

has many varied personalities as any ©

house on campus, but I think there is
a tendency to be more academically
oriented than socially.”’

SAE: Khakis, Topsiders, sand, and
the Beachboys, (Stuart Sanders), ‘‘A
variegated group of guys who are
bound together by an active social life
and a strong national fraternity
brotherhood. Only twelve people in
the house own khakis.’ (Mark Mel-
endy), ‘‘A highly active and con-
cerned group of people with great
participation in community service
projects, and a great desire for
fraternal brotherhood...

F & M: Predominantly Fiji, with a
propensity to party. (Mary Amos),
“Despite the large number of people
at our house, I believe we are closer as
a group than most of the other eating
houses. Our active social life may be
one reason for this, but it is not the
only one.” (Holt Foushee), “F & M is
the only house on the court that
combines a strong national fraternity
(Fiji) along with a large number of
coeds. It is definitely the most social
oriented of the coed houses.”’

. Phi Delta Theta: The Phi Delt
Four, football players, and BEER.
(Bob Hayman), ‘‘There are a lot of
popular misconceptions about the Phi
Delt house that need to be changed.
Many people seem to think our house
consists of nothing but a bunch of
football players who do nothing but
get high, get drunk, and raise hell
together. Well, that’s not true: not
everyone’s a football player.”’ (Frank
Cebul), ‘‘Our house consists of a
diverse group of guys organized
around an active social life and
participation in sports. There has
been a strengthening of the fraternal
brotherhood in the past few years.”’

All this happens with every cigarette you smoke.

ETC: Does this place really exist?
Stronghold of the SPE’s. (B. A.
Summerell), ‘The fraternity members
eating at our house add a dimension
to our house character that many of
the eating houses lack. People down
here feel that ETC is more than just
an eating house; it is their house.’’
(Chuck Jones), ‘‘I think that the
personality of the house is more
low-key than those of many houses on
the court. The food is better than at
many of the houses, and I appreciate
the fact that people don’t throw
food.”’

KA: Grits, fried chicken, and
Robert E. Lee. (Bill Pitman), ‘‘We
don’t feel that the KA’s have. a
stereotype, and because of this we
attract a very open and diverse
membership. During the past year
we've been strengthening our house
ties with the national fraternity.’’
(Dave Thomas), ‘‘I believe the KA’s

present the most diverse group of.

guys in any of the national fraterni-

ties. We don’t conform to any stereo-.

‘type because of this diversity: We are

united: by athletics, an active social |i}

life, and the fraternal bond.”

Emanon: Stronghold of WAD and
the ERA. (Debbie Davis), ‘‘I feel that
having a large number of girls makes
for a more relaxed atmosphere. We
have two cooks who are not afraid to
experiment, and a big plus is our hot
breakfast. While we have the usual
open band parties, our social activi-
ties are centered in the house.” (Al
Edmonds), “‘Emanon has a diverse
spectrum ranging from both AC to
DC, giving its members the option of
joining one group and laughing at the
other. This allows us to be the only
house on the court to compete with
both the library rats and the FUBAR
Club.”

PIKA: Isn’t that some kind of fish?
(Toy Fountain), ‘‘While there is a
diversity to our group, we are willing
to tolerate each other's: idiosyncra-
cies. The menu plan is adjusted to
accomodate both the males and
females in our house. There has been a
movement back to the ties with the
national fraternity, but I hope that
this will not sway girls away. from our
house.”’ (John Ratliff), ‘‘While our
house is a fraternity, the thing I like
best about it is that you can eat down
there with no pressure to join the
fraternity.”
