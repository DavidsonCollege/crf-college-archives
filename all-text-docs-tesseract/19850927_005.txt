PE Grades To Appear On Student Records

By NELLE McCORKLE

For the first time, failing
grades in Physical’ Education
courses will appear on students”
permanent records, according to
Registrar Sue Ross. ’

For the past two years, stu-
dents have been required to com-
plete the PE requirements before
beginning the seventh term at
Davidson, Ross said. Eighty
members of the class of 1987 who
had not completed the require-
ment at the end of spring term
1985 were required to participate
in summer contract courses,
camps, classes in _ their
hometowns, and other approved

activities before they were permit-
ted to return to Davidson. “We felt
ample notification had been given

‘throughout the year,” said PE Di-

rector Sterling Martin, referring to
the letters his office had sent regu-
larly to those students whose re-
quirements were incomplete.

Five of those eighty students
did not complete their remaining
requirements, and Ross said that
although those’ students were
planning to transfer or otherwise
withdraw none of them is eligible
to return because of PE deficien-
cies. She said, “One. of the five
students wrote me that he was
transferring, but he promised to

swim every day during the sum-
mer! I wrote him back that he'd
have to take -acontract course,”

‘but never heard’ from the student.

in reply.

Ross said students failing to
fulfill PE requirements by the
seventh term are subject to the
Faculty Executive Committee’s
conditions for readmission. She
said, “It would be helpful if
freshman/sophomore faculty ad-
visors would remind students each

term of PE requirements.”

Of the over forty courses the
PE department offers, Ross said,
“They (the department) have
worked diligently to provide var-

ied activities to accomodate stu-
dents’ needs, and to promote the
philosdphy of a healthy body as
part of the total healthy student.”

Ross said the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee and Student Gov-
emment Association endorsed a
PE department recommendation
that failing grades be recorded
permanently. The Faculty Execu-
tive Committee, an elected group
of professors, voted to make this
recommendation a regulation, ef-
fective this term. Under the new
ruling, a student who does not
complete a PE course for which he
or she is registered will receive an
“F” on his or her record. Prior to

Campus Police Sport New Look, Image

By ANDY BALL

With the fall term now barely
inching into its third week, most
students are beginning to be come
readjusted to the sights and sounds
of campus life. One difference is
the new Davidson College Police
Officers’ uniforms.

“They’re the official David-
son Police uniforms instead of the
blue, Campus Security ones we
had last year,” says Campus
Police Chief Jackie Hughes, cit-
ing one of the ways the Depart-
ment is changing its image.
“We’ re just trying to get across the

idea that we are Police officers -

and not Security Guards:
Chief Hughes has good reason

to concern himself with image.

He’s been on the force here for the
last thirteen years, seven of which
were spent as Chief Director of
Public Safety for the college, as
well as assistant Chief of Police
for the town of Davidson.

“A security guard isn’t re-
quired to have any kind of train-
ing,” Hughes said. “All you need
to do is pick any guy off the street

and hire him. A police officer
must go through a lot more
specialization.”

Jackie Hughes should know.
After serving in the army from
1948-72 and retiring as a Master
Sergeant, he began qualifying for
his Associate’s Degree in Law En-
forcement at CPCC in Charlotte.
In addition to the two years of
classes he completed, he was also
required to complete minimum of
360 hours of Police service and
training.

In 1972, Chief Hughes bought
a house near the college, joined
the Davidson Police Department,
and in 1973, was assigned to the
campus (precinct 2). He was
rapidly promoted to Lieutenant
and then to Captain in 1974. By
1978 he had become Chief Direc-
tor of Public Safety and was work-
ing on requirement sot recieve his
Advanced Law Enforcement Cer-
tificate. “It’s quite hard to get,”
stated Hughes. “There are a lot of
service and training hours in-
volved, as well as a requirement
of nine years experience in the

field.” Hughes completed the nine
years and received his certifica-
tion in 1981. Issued by the Justice
Department and signed by the At-
torney General, the certificate is
not only wholly impressive, but
also, as Hughes put it, “really nice
to have.”

But why the need to distin-
guish between security guard and
police officer? “It’s mostly in
cases where we have to deal with
backup from the outside that it’s
most important.” When working
in conjuction with the ERS
(emergency rescue service), the

" fire department and the rest of the

Davidson Police Department, in-
stant recognition as a certified
police officer is vital to communi-
cation between the involved agen-
cies. “Before, it was sometimes
hard to perform adequately,”
Hughes admitted.

Along with the new look of the
department, Hughes reports that it
is also continuing to arrange meet-
ings with freshmen Hall Coun-
selors and Resident Advisors in

Police Chief Jackie Hughes

order to develop better crime pre-
vention techniques. “With only
two officers on duty at a time, stu-
dents need to be aware that
they’ve got to watch out for them-

this term, only a “P” or passing
grade appeared on a student’ 8 per-
manent record.

Davidson’s PE requirements,
which must be completed before
beginning the junior year, consist
of participation in one team sport
(on the intramural, club, or varsity
level) and a. proficiency or com-
pletion of a course in one water
and two lifetime sports. Ross
explained the two lifetime sports
requirement as an emphasis on
“things people will be able to
enjoy for a long time.”

Originally from Ohio, Hughes
has lived with his wife in David-
son for fourteen years and has four
children and five grandchildren.
