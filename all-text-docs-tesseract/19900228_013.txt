add to today’s thesis:

1) Iceberg lettuce, according to Ricky
Ricardo, “has some ’splainin to do.”

2) Bacon bits are actually ground up
Japanese beetles.

3) Croutons, literally “hardened
melba toast of the occult,” originated in
the southern Chinese rain forests-and
taste like salty Captain Crunch.

- Takealookat what Dr. Ruskin Vale-
tudinarian, author of Croutons—Why

the Funny Name? and There's a Salad
Dressing in my Fridge, says about sal-
ads: “People who try to makea meal of
a salad--girls especially--are eating for
attention. A girl wantsother girls to see
that she is ona dietor eating light. This
display is all very unfortu-
nate since most lettuce, ice-
berg especially, has little or
no nutritional value--it is
mere roughage, a simple
filler.”

Dr. Valetudinarianadds,
“Tt’snota substantial meal.
Oh sure, some of the
greener lettuce has good
vitamins and maybe alittle
iron, and, yes, other vege-
tables that accompany a salad, such as
cucumbers, radishes, carrots, etc, are
good sources of fiber, but the fact is
that a salad does not a meal make.
Your body needs a variety of foods.”

SUGGESTIONS ABOUT SALADS
1) Eat a salad with meal, not as a meal.
2) If you must eat a salad for lunch or

Nota salad.

Cease her salad and give her a real meal

supper, add a small portion of beans,
meat (turkey, chicken, ham even) or
pasta. Make it substantial.
3) 86 the dressing (in the army “86”
means “get rid of”). If you can’t “86”
the dressing, then at least cut down or
substitute it with
low-fat cottage
cheese or something.
4) The greener the
lettuce; the more
nutritional value.
5) Eat more broccoli,
cauliflower, carrots,
tomatoes, canta-
loupe (if it’s avail-
able), beans, etc.
6) Easy on thecheese.
7) Stay away from fruit in heavy
juices.
8) Easy on the artificial bacon bits and
croutons.
9) Be aware.of chicken salad, ham
salad, tuna salad--remember, mayon-
naise can kill you ona hot day.
