jn Cornelius. No statement was
made as to what capacity he was
expected to assume. Nation
Crowell indicated that the dances
were a complete success in his mind
except for the fact that his date
was a little upset by the fact that
her application for membership in
the Wrightsville Yacht Club had
been refused on the grounds that
she had no yacht. Crowell admit-
ted that she was a member of the
Lexington Country Club.

Bill “Russian Incident” Camp-
bell remained in retirement most
of the week end. In his single ap-
pearance from behind the bleachers
during the decoration of the Arm-

ory, he stated, “What a lot of
crepe!” before. returning to his
work.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON

Midwinters has come and gone
but is’ not forgotten. The banquet
Friday night at the Ship Ahoy was
au good one, but it seemed to get
the best of Thatcher and he was
called on his eagerness. Brothers
Gregg, Plonk, Haynes, and Willard
really deserve a hand for their pro-
gram. Ed Lilly’s date was rather
perplexed; it seems every time she
axkedl jerk Hel
changed the subject and color. Why
don’t you draw her a picture, Ed?
“Flop,” as usual, made a couple
of short appearances aft ‘the dances.
Apparently just to be seen there
once a night. Boys your
women when T. W. comes around

. ask Hurd*Bradford. It seems
that White had some trouble with
a short one Saturday night and
would have choked to death but
for Hugh andJule._Hay_really
looked as though he enjoyed thrill-
ing the girls Saturday night, but
George Thomason really had a hard
time making the rounds. No re-
ports on the “Wart’s” actions after
the dances has come in. Is that good
ov bad, “Wart’’? Congratulations
to Christopher for a neat recoup
after a late flush. Blind date hon-
ors go to White and Richard Lilly.
They must have been living right.
Many, many, interesting incidents
occurred over the week end, but
yours truly was very much like
Winchester (M. C. at the banquet)
... full Friday night, but out of
gas Saturday.

KAPPA ALPHA

The pledges of Sigma chapter are
all saying “This is it.” They mean
that this is the week for which
they have been waiting, the week
in which they are to be formally
initiated into the Kappa Alpha
Order. The event will take place
this Saturday and Sunday after-
noons.

Brother Jeffries came through
again and I think we must admit
that the Mid-Winters Set excelled
previous standards. Mac led the
Pan-Hell figure Friday night with
Miss Virginia Owens, and Brother
Jackson was in there with Miss Vir-
