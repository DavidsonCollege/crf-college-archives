GERMAN STUDENT 10 EXPRESS

VIEWS ON LIFE IN HOMELAND

Sinee I am a new ‘student at Davidson College, | first of all

would like to introduee myself :

my name is Kurt Hans Bieden-

kopf, my hometown is Weisbaden (near trankfurt), Germany.
I have the great opportunity to spend the school year 1949-
1950 as an exchange student at this college. Let me take this

chance to thank Davidson College*

and li Kappa Phi for making this
year of study in the U.S.A. possible.

A very important, if not the
most important part of the work
an exchanche-student is supposed
to do is to tell the people as. much
ashe can about his homeland, its
people, their way of living and
thinking and in exchanche learn
as much as he can about the coun-
try, he is now-in. It is very true
that many of the conflicts between
the nations of the world were and
still_ are caused by fatal distrusts
and unnecessary misunderstandings
that could have been avoided if
people would only have known
each other better. In order to
help in creating good will, under-
standing and friendship among’ the
nations of the world, young men
and women of all parts of Europe
and America, Asia and Africa are
sent all over the world, and 1 am
very happy to be one of those.
} shall do my best to tell you
everything you want to know a-
Lowt Germany and the olq world.

Maybe you are interested in how
] happened to be selected as an
e:change student. Well — here
is the story: In February ‘48 some
friend: of mine and I started to
publish a school newspaper at our
high school, the editor in chief !

The Davidsonian is happy to
announce that Kurt Biedenkoph
has consented to write a column
in chis space each week. Kurt,
late from Germany, is studying
political science at Davidson un-

have been until 1 left Germany.
We used to have meetings of the
editors in chief of all German
schoo] newspapers every 3 or 4
months and to invite officials of
the educational branch of Military.
Government. It was one of these
officials who gave me the idea
to miake an application for a scho-
farship in the U. S., and so I did
in May 1948. lor a long time
nothing happened. The project
seemed to have been disappeared
in the tong channels of bureau-
cracy. Until then in December
1948 it happened. I had to start
doing a lot of paperwork and to
go through several examinations.
In February it seemed that I was
considered to be alright for the

job and I was full of joy. Then
again for a long time nothing
was to be heard. At last in

July I received a letter from Odell

Court of Control
Swings Into Action

Ata meeting of the student hody
Wednesday morning, the Honorable
Douglas Rice (otherwise known as
Ruthless Rice) introduced — the
members of the Court of Control
to the freshman class and stated
charges against violators of the
freshman regulations. The court
is composed of Judge Rice, Re-
corder Jim Vann and the Honora-
bles Richards, leach, Kelton,
Acker and Wade.

The first action of the court

‘man class for a. week because of

three charges served against them.

|The charges were painting a red

53 on the water tower, painting
over it in silver, and then not hav-
ing enough pride in the class of
*53° to leave it on the tower.

Those obnoxious freshmen who
yot off to an early start in the
race. for the yellow cap and attended
the couft’s first meeting are as
follows: :

1. Bennett, Joha: No hat, not
speaking, absent at pep rally, not
carrying laundry.

2. Blatt, Phil: Gross obnoxious-
ness, disrespect for school and up-
perclassmen.

3. Crymes, Bill: Disturbance,
loud talking, generally obnoxious.

4. Davis, Vhil: Laughing at up-
perclassmen.

5. Hobson, Jack: In league with
Crymes to cause disturbance.

6. Jameson, J. L.: Absent
Queens dance.

7. Kepler, M.: Disrespect, disap-
proval. and disregard for student
yovernment. oo

8. Mauze, H.: Acting like he is
heaven sent to Davidson College.

9 Moylan, D.: not wearing hat.

10. Garrison, R: Extremely in-
considefate, inactive and  unco-
operative,

11, Herndon, W.: Worst sort of
obnoxiousness, no hat in chapel
and swearing.

12. Myers, M.: No hat.

_13. Nelson, L.; Not speaking, no
hat.

14. Sellars, P.; Smith, R.; and
Stuart, A: Absent at Queens dance.

15. Swan, H.: No cap, general
disturbance and trouble making.

16. Tolbert H.: Absent
Queens.

17. Thoinason, G.: Walking on
grass, refusing to give name.

It is hoped that the first actions
of the court will influence the
freshmen to stay in line and fol-
low the freshmen regulations to
the letter.

The court has appealed to the
upperclassmen to continue their
support of the court.

Again this year the responsibility

Only two of last years cheer-

has had two years of experience
behind him, and Cassels, who has
one year to his credit. But around
this nucleus a live-wire’ group has
been formed. From the Sopho:

who hails from Charlotte, N. C.
In the springtime Bruce spends
his time on the track with Coach
Pete Whittle and his crew. From
the Junior Class somebody talked
Monty Hill into giving his time
and vocal cords to the cause.
Monty, whose home is Greensboro,
N. C., is a natural in more ways
than one. In. golf he has piled
up an cetstanding record and is
expected to shine even more this
year. From the Senior Class came
Bo Roddey, Grady Spires, and
Billy Houck. Bo is widely known
for his excellent performance at

Obnoxious Oddities Commit Atrocities

Unparalleled In History Of Davidson

PETE KALOGR

A. startling announcement was
flashed throughout the campus dur-
ing the past week. Members of
the freshmen class, in complete
and utter disregard for the college
and city ordinances, painted their
numeral, upon the water tower.

The announcement, of course,
caused a wave of excitement on
the campus. Many  upperclass-
men -sadly shook their heads and
entered into deliberations in an at-
tempt to reach some sort of solu;
tion for the problem presented by
the obnoxiousness of the freshman
class.

But just as the. deliberations
were getting underway and some
peaceful solution was being saught
for the freshman problem, these
very deliberations were brought to
an abrupf halt by another outra-
geous act on the part of the fresh.
men.

upperclassmen,

The problem was now attacked
with renewed vigor. Kor now all
the upperclassmen had risen as a

body and demanded the punish-
ment of the cuipeits. Not only
lating the watertower — ordinance

were the freshnien guilty of vio-
twice ‘in a row, but they were also
guilty of the much more serious
charge of showing a definite lack
of spirit through painting out their
numerals.

The Court of Control promptly
swung into action. Judge Doug
Rice announced to the freshmen
that unless those directly respon-
sible for the ‘painting turned ‘them-
selves jn, the entire freshman class
would be campused.

But the threat was to no avail.

‘

In chapel! Wednesday morning
Judge Rice proclaimed a one-week
campus, but since those guilty had
not yet reported themselves, the
upperclassmen clamored for a two,
three, or even four week campus
instead of the one.

However, Judge Rice was mo-
mentarily able to satisfy the de-
mands of the upperclassmen by
assuring them that justice\yould
be brought about and the fr
men would soon learn’ that it was
wise to obey all rules, regulations,
and ordinances.

Indeed, it seems to be the gen-
eral consensus of opinion among
the upperclassmen that the class
of '53 is entirely too obnoxious.
Rumors are circulating throughout

the campus to the effect that there

will soon be some desirable
changes made.
