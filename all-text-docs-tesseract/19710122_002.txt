tion. The NSA, sometimes
linked with radical causes,
has incurred large debts
which many senators felt
Davidson College could be
held responsible for at some
later time. ‘After assurances
were given that the college
would not be _ responsible
for debts, the Senate voted
to join the NSA and voted
to approve the $25 a year
membership fee.

For the past year the
school has been on a trial
membership basis with par-
tial benefits from NSA.

In other action Wednesday

provement.”

They stressed the possbile
importance of events off
campus to this end and said
of their plans,» ‘‘We. don’t
intend to get involved in
misty platitudes about mor-
ality.”

Grissett saw the major
thrust of his plans besides
the fraternity issue to be ‘‘to
enable students to get the
news and see varying
opinions on it so they can
better formulate their own
ideas concerning these hap-
penings and how they affect
their life at Davidson.”

Grissett said he ‘‘would

view other issues as to how
I_ think they would or would
not benefit the Davidson stu-
dent,”

The number of people ap-
plying to Davidson this year
is down. As of January 18,
only 618 people had applied
for admission to the fresh-
man class.

“It must be realized that
this a different crop of high
school seniors,’ said H. Ed-

SGA President Ran Coble
announced that Admissions
Director H. Edmunds White
had agreed to student parti-
cipation in policy decisions
of his committee, and would

« Support the proposal in fa-

culty meetings.

Continued publication of a
school ahnual received at-
tention, with a committee be-
ing set up to study alterna-
tives and to conduct a stu-
dent opinion poll to deter-
mine student attitudes to-
ward the annual.

It was recommended that
all students running for the
office of Editor of the An-
nual be informed that such
an office may not exist, de-
pending upon the actions of
the committee .

The matter of thé continu-
ed publication of the annual
had ‘been discussed by the
Publications Board, which

, . Voted to turn the study over

to the Senate.

In asking the senate to do
the study the board request-
ed that the president of the
publications board and the
editor of the annual be al-
lowed to participate. The
final decision on the con-
tinuation .of the “‘Quips and
Cranks” will rest with the
publication board.

Applicant To

munds White, director of
admissions. The major rea-
‘son cited by White was the
rising costs which have hit
Davidson as they have other
private institutions.

He pointed out that other
“private colleges have had a
decreasing number of appli-
cations in the last two or
three years, and this has

hit Davidson this particular
year.

“The general economy of
the country is in a_ reces-
sion. Tuition and other re-
lated costs are substantial,
and - the public | is more
hesistant to apply ‘to inde-
pendent institutions,” com-
mented White.

According to White, peo-
ple may be applying to col-
lege later this year, and he
has heard talk of this. ‘‘Stu-
dents may not panic about
college applications the way
they did in past. years,” said
White.

It may be that students
are not putting ‘in as many
multiple applications as they
formerly did, Last year, 61%
of those accepted enrolled
at Davidson, and he beliey-

ed he might get a ‘higher per- ©

centage to accept David.

“Although I think the
basketball team is doing
well this year, it has not

matched: the performance of _
past~ years, and this might |

have some effect on the

number = applying,” White
theorized, '

He pointed out that it

Editor’s Note: The following
interview with Collége Pre-
sident. Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. was conducted by Assist-
ant Managing Editor Rich-
rd Wilson in order that
the President could clarify
his/_ position on different
pects of the report by the
Committee of Eighteen.

Were you surprised at the
number of freshmen that
went out for rush? .

Not particularly, I think
it’s perfectly understandable.

I realize there was strong
sentiment in this direction
in the freshman class.

lf freshmen do not want
to eat down at the house to
which they are assigned, will
they be forced to anyway?

The freshmen do not have
to eat at their house, but
this is where their meal is
paid for.

Out of which fund will the
money come from to imple-
ment the social system?

We will get that-from the
Contingency Fund. This fund
covers unforseen expenses
which come up during the
year. There is approximate-
ly $100,000 in this fund. The
money for the freshmen so-
cial expenses and the money
‘to buy the fraternity furni-
ture will come out of this
fund. We hope there will be
enough to cover these ex-
penses.

How will you enforce the
sevénth’ guideline of the
trustee’s proposal,—the one

college is in the national
limelight, for favorable pub-
licity always helps. ‘

For the last three or
four years there have been
major economic pressures
against private colleges, and

_ pus?

I don’t know. We'll deal
with this if it comes up.
We hoped this would not
take place. We are hoping
the students will stay on
campus and* contribute’ ty
the sense of community.

lf it appeared that frater-
nities are going off-campus
successfully, would you com.
prémise on the social sy.
stem?

There is no intention to
compromise on_ it.

Is the Committee of Ejigh-
teen still in existence?

The Committee of Eighteen
was_-dissolved—when- they is.
sued their report. The com.
mittee will not be redctivat
ed.

Do you have any com.
ment on the harassment
freshmen are experiencing
at some of the houses to
which they are assigned?

I am not surprised there
are problems, In any sy
stem where there has been
major change, difficulties
will . occur.

If a majority of a house
voted to reject the college
plan but a sizeable minor-
ity want to remain on cam-
pus, will they be allowed to
keep the house they are in?

There is’ no definite plan
for the assignment of vacant
houses. We. will have to
work it out. I ‘suggest that
they put in their written re-
quest for a house. -

although White sees an
improvement in the present
national economic situation
easing this pressure some-
what, he does not believe
the » general pattern is go-
ing to change.
