Baseball Team Clobbers Furman, The Citadel

By EDWIN PAGE

Last weekend the Davidson
baseball team attained the goal
they have been striving for all sea-
son. By sweeping three games
from -Furman, while Western
Carolina did the same to The
Citadel, the Cats assured them-
selves of having one of the four
conference playoff spots. While
this was wonderful news for the
Cats, perhaps just as wonderful
was the manner in which the
sweep was accomplished.

For the first time in the confer-
ence season, Davidson’s pitchers
emerged from the shadows of the

Cats’ big bats to lead the team.
Junior Scott Weaver, freshman
David Fitzgerald and sophomore
Steve Condon all pitched com-
plete games and yielded only one,
two and three runs respectively.
‘While the Cats have been pound-
ing out hits and pushing across
multitudes of runs this season, the
Pitching has been less than spec-
tacular. But against Furman, that
changed. Weaver dominated The
Paladins, yielding the lone run
without surrendering a hit in the
inning. In the nightcap, Fitzgerald
used the whole ball park, includ-
ing the warning track to retire the

Furman hitters. Over the seven in-
nings Fitzgerald allowed only five
hits en route to the victory.

On Sunday, Condon worked

the first complete game of his col-
lege career tO collect his fourth
win and even his record for the
season.
While the pitching came alive,
the hitters continued producing
runs. Sophomore Mark
Thompson had a homerun and a
double and freshman Bill Masse
had three hits as the Cats collected
nine runs to back Weaver.

In the second game the Cats
were the beneficiaries of some

Furman gratuitites, collecting five
runs on only four hits. Weaver put
Davidson ahead to stay in the sec-
ond when, following two Furman
errors, delivered a two-nun

single. On Sunday, it was Weaver -

again who keyed the Cats. He
drilled a three-run homer in the
first to stake the team to a 4-0 lead
as the Cats rolled to the 10-3 win.

The sweep put the Cats at 8-5
in the conference and __ this
weekend they face first-place
Western Carolina (11-3) at home
for a three-game series. A bit of
simple math will show that if
Davidson can manage a sweep

they will finish ahead of Western.
Not only would a first-place finish
put a great cap on the dramatic tur-
naround from last year’s 5-12 con-
ference record, but it would allow
the Cats to bypass Appalachian
‘State in the first round of the
playoffs. Team coach George
Greer rates ASU as one of the best
teams in the conference, but feels
that the rest of the Northern Divi-
sion teams are a notch down. A
sweep will not be easy, but ac-
cording to Weaver, “If we play the
way we've been playing and get
the kind of pitching we got this
weekend, we'll win three.”

Tennis Regroups In Preparation For Tournament

The men’s tennis tearn gener-

Coach Frank is “probably the

number four team in the confer-

By STEVE MACMILLAN

After getting off to a slow start
this season, the men’s golf team
had two impressive finishes last
week. On Wednesday the team
grabbed sixth place out of 19
teams in the Belmont Abbey invi-
tational. Senior co-captain Steve
MacMillan paced the team with a
75 and finished fifth individually.
Sophomore Tom Davis shot 78.

On Friday the team faced
Catawba, Gardner Webb, and
Western Carolina at Charlotte

Country Club. Davis led the field
with a fine 77, and MacMillan,

junior Bob Carr, and sophomore

Tyler Long supplemented the at-
tack as Davidson won by six
strokes. The match marked the
first time this spring that Davidson
has defeated conference rival
Western.

Earlier in the season the team
travelled to Charleston, SC to play
in the Citadel Invitational. Al-
though the team played well, suff
competition dropped them to an

eighth-place finish out of 12
teams. Davis and senior co-cap-
tain Todd Wiebusch led the team
with identical scores of 81-78.

In the Elon Tournament in
Burlington, Carr shot 80-76 and
Davis shot 79-80 to lead Davidson
to a disappointing — 1 7th-place
finish in the 22-team tournament.

The team ts now preparing for
the Southern Conference tourna-
ment which runs Monday through
Wednesday of this week

Frisbee Golfers Tee Off In Annual Tournament

By SCOTT HUIE
Frisbee golf is booming across
America, and now you members
of the Davidson community have
an opportunity to take part in this
sports phenomenon. Named after
one of Davidson’s most illustrious
presidents and most avid frisbee
enthusiastsgL. Grier Martin, the
3rd Annual Davidson Frisbee
Golf Tournament will be held to-
morrow on the grounds of David-
son College from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. It promises to challenge and
entertain all participants, regard-
less of past frisbee experience.
Frisbee golf is played like reg-
ular golf, only a frisbee is thrown
at a target rather than a ball hit into
acup. Already some of the touring
pros are engaged in intense prepa-
ration, polishing ‘up on their put-
ting and working on their chip
shots as well. Some are even par-
taking in verbal warfare. Here are
some excerpts:
—Dr. David Shi: “Ortmayer,
Slagle and Kazee have long been
' bragging about their golf game,
but put a frisbee in their hands and

they quickly reveal the wimps that
they truly are. While the rest of us
in the 60s were doing something
significant, i.e. throwing frisbees,
they were drinking beer and chas-
ing women. Now the results of
their depravity will be brought to
light.”

—Dr. Peter Krentz:
“Ortmayer has been working on

_his bulk to get more behind his

frisbee golf drive. It’s ruined his
volleyball game, but we hope it
will pay off this weekend.”

—Dr. Tom Kazee: “In real
golf, the problem with Ortmayer’s
game is that he can’t see the tee
anymore. Maybe he’ Il have better
luck in frisbee golf. Concerning
Lewis, someone from Ohio State
ought to be good at this sport.
That’s all they did. Maybe we
could paint a peace sign on her
frisbee to get her to play.”

—Dr. Cynthia Lewis: “A
peace sign, huh, well you'll have
to check Kazee’s I.D. to make
sure he’s old enough to play.”

—Mr. Matt Merrill: “Down
here in admissions, we all are

athletes—except for maybe Steve ~———~_

Soud—so we’re gonna win that
tournament.”

—Coach Charlie Slagle:
“Kazee worked at Tulane before
he came here. So I think he’s try-
ing to fix this tournament.”

—Dr. Lou Ortmayer: ‘Krentz
can’t spike in frisbee golf; he’s
just a loser. Kazee’s frisbee golf
could be pretty good if he could
keep it in play. As for Shi, keep-
ing it simple is not a philosophy of
life, it’s an athletic mandate.”

—Dr. Karl Plank: “The apos-
tle Paul invented frisbee golf.”

—Dr. Trent Foley: “I don’t
have tenure yet, so I’m reluctant
to say that McKelway couldn’t hit
the broad side of a barn from three
feet with a frisbee.”

—Dr. Charles Ratliff: “Our
Eco. majors will beat the religion
majors regardless of who they
may think are on their side.”

—Dr. Price Zimmermann:
“Kuykendall is a pretty good fris-
bee golf player, to hear him talk.”

—Kazee: “If Kuykendall
plays frisbee golf like he plays

John Kuykendall: “I will win this frisbee golf tournament—period .”

softball, then he’s gonna trip over
the first tee.”

—Dr. John Kuykendall: “I
will win this frisbee golf tourna-
ment—period.”

There you have it folks: the

jabs, the challenges, the freshly
cut greens, the media, the fris
bees. All the elements are in place
for the major frisbee golf tourna-
ment of the year. And the winner
is...
