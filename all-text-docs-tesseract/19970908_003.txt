The preliminary results of the
“Core Drug and Alcohol Survey,”
which 253 randomly-selected stu-
dents filled out last spring, have
been tabulated. They are a sum-
mary of the raw data from the Core

Problematic Experiences as a Result of Alcohol and Drug Use

Davidson stacks up against other
small colleges, defined as private
four-year institutions with student
populations of 2,500 or less.

The survey revealed that 86
percent of Davidson students had
consumed alcohol within the past
year. Seventy-four percent of un-
derage students consumed alcohol
in the 30 days prior to the survey.

“binge” is defined as consuming
five or more drinks in one sitting.
The national average is 39 percent.

As for the use of illegal drugs,
32 percent of the students admitted
to using marijuana in the past year
and 15 percent admitted to using
regularly. Thirteen percent used an
illegal drug other than marijuana in
the past year. Almost four percent
of students reportedly
use illegal drugs other
than marijuana.

11,884 from small colleges and
42,735 from colleges and universi-
ties nation-wide. Although ran-

comprises only about one-sixth of
the student population.

The general figures show how

These figures are typical of small
liberal arts colleges, but are higher
than the figures at national univer-
sities.

About 90 percent of students
believe drinking is central to a
students’ social life.

Practically half (49 percent) of
the students admitted to binge drink-

‘ing in the previous two weeks. A

of the pack for small
liberal arts colleges.
But the school should take little
pride in its mediocrity. Davidson
does not differ noticeably from na-
tional averages in most of the re-
sults.

Regarding alcohol, the num-
bers are high, but they. are high for
most other colleges and universi-
ties.

Thirty-day Prevalence of Substance Use for Davidson Students

Davidson

Every school knows that it can-
not eliminate underage alcohol use
on campus, but can only-do its best
to manage it and make sure it does
not become excessive.

The results indicate that
Davidson does rather well in ac-
complishing that goal.

Only 19 percent of students
reported driving under the influ-
ence of alcohol, 15 percent below
the national average.

The numbers indicate that keeping
parties on the Court and under the
security of police and risk manag-
ers deters students from driving off-
campus to get alcohol, ultimately
decreasing the chance that students

-will drink and drive.

The figures regarding the use
of illegal drugs should receive fur-

ther examination.

They require that the following
questions be answered:

Do patterns of drug use ‘at
Davidson deviate significantly from
national patterns?

Why is it that the smart, well-
educated students of Davidson do
not have a notably lower rate of
illegal drug use compared to stu-
dents elsewhere?

Does this campus need stricter
penalties or extra prevention pro-
grams to combat a drug problem?

The stricter drug policy and
greater focus on education are the
most visible steps. Davidson has
taken to decrease illegal drug use on
campus.

Only time will tell if these
changes will lessen drug use.

Until then, the college commu-
nity should read the accompanying
charts and figure out for themselves
if the results are appropriate for
what we.all think Davidson is or
should be.

Ethnic conflict threatens education in Burundi

stacles that arose from the ethnic
conflict.

Ethnic violence between the
underclass Hutus — at 85 percent
of Burundi’s population, the vast
majority — and the upperclass
Tutsis erupted in October 1993 when
the country’s first democratically-
elected Hutu president was assassi-
nated in a failed coup by the Tutsi-
run military.

The Hutus’ main grievance is
their lack of access to power, while
the Tutsis are concerned about their
survival as an ethnic group if the
Hutus were to gain power.

After the conflict began, many
Hutus could not finish school be-
cause of terrorist dangers. Safety is
not guaranteed for Hutus because
the Tutsis control the army.

In 1995, a Tutsi-led ethnic
cleansing program sought to rid the
campus of Hutus. Grenades were
thrown into Hutu rooms and the
armed militia came on campus.

The Yoders helped 15 Hutus
continue their education by renting
a house in the city from which they
could commute.

Educational access was further
limited to Hutus in January when
the government closed the univer-
sity to first- and second-year stu-
dents and required them to serve
one year in the army before they
could return. Because the army
was Tutsi-controlled, Hutus did not
feel safe there and could not com-
plete the government requirement.
The new law denied Hutus univer-
sity access.

One female Hutu medical stu-
dent, Suzy remembered, was tall
and, therefore, looked Tutsi.

“Most Tutsi are taller than
hutus,” Suzy said. “This student
was real scared on campus, so she
passed as a Tutsi. When the Tutsi
found out she was a Hutu, she had to
flee. Security guards had to go back
and get her bags. She only finished

would stay in the room with the
Hutu students while they took their
exams. This was part of an experi-
ment to determine whether having
outsiders present would modify the
behavior of rebels and reduce the
level of conflict.

her third year of medical school.”

“The morale of students was
low,” Suzy continued, noting the
high percentage of them with AIDS.
“They are irresponsible with life,

drinking and having sex. It really -

saddened and surprised me. All
wars bring morale down.”

The paranoia and mistrust in
Burundi made concentrating and
studying difficult. Many Hutu stu-
dents kept a.duffel bag packed and
moved each night to a different
sleeping place. ‘

Once Hutus did not feel safe

enough to take final exams. Col- :

Suzy, who has a background in
counseling and is currently research-
ing and preparing presentations on
forgiveness, frequently met with
groups of women to give them a
chance to tell their stories and work
through their grief.

The Yoders found it especially
hard because they heard both sides

_of the story. “Each side was so
convincing,” Lauren said. .“The
people were sharp, articulate, pol-
ished, but were imprisoned in their
ethnicity. Their interpretations of
history reflected their ethnicity.”

The Yoders tried to remain
impartial by mixing With people

from both ethnic groups. This kept
them from being targeted as for-
eigners sympathetic to'the Hutu or
Tutsi cause.

“The violence was amazing,”
Lauren said, “especially since ev-
eryone was gracious. Even the sol-

Will Bradshaw

diers were generally pleasant with
us.”

Traveling by road was danger-
ous in a countryside controlled by
rebel soldiers. Ambushes and ve-
hicle burnings were common. Only
abouta third of the country was safe
in‘ which to travel. The Yoders
would check with the United Na-.
tions security office or with U.S.
embassy officials before traveling
to find out the latest danger spots.

The Yoders recall rebel sol-
diers who ambushed vehicles,
forced passengers to strip, and dis-
played them at the_local«market-
place. :

To ensure their own safety dur-
ing their road trips and to avoid
attracting bandits, the Yoders drove
an old beat-up Toyota. On one trip,
they encountered a military check-
point every 10 miles.

During their two years, the
Yoders were involved in numerous
peace projects: development of a
so-called peace soap opera for
Burundi radio which showed Hutu
and Tutsi families living side by
side, overhearing each other’s pain
and fear across a bamboo hedge
between them; reforestation projects
in Zaire; refugee assistance in
Rwanda; community and church
leader meetings in the “Great Lakes”
region of Africa to present a united
front to the government and rebels .
in support of negotiations; and news
transmittal from those inside
Burundi to those in exile.

Through peace committees
with Hutu, Tutsi, soldiers, and the
general population, the Yoders felt
trust was slowly being established.
But peace may prove longerincom-
ing. A peace meeting scheduled for
Aug. 25 was canceled because the
government felt the mediator was
no longer impartial.

When asked whether the
Yoders planned to write a book on ~
their experiences, they said they
would never want to benefit from
the suffering of the Burundians.

“IT would see it as an invasion of
privacy,” Lauren said.

Suzy described her experience
as “heartrendeing.” Lauren called
his “challenging.”

He said he hopes to return to
Burundi in two or three years. But
his bigger hope is that it will be to a
Burundi at peace.
