THE DAVIDSONIAN

Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson, its drive for
~ national prominence am-
bushed by successive losses
in the enemy camps of
Wake Forest and West Vir-
ginia, now faces two stern
tests of its championship
mettle.

Within the next five days the
Wildcats will meet challenges
hurled at them by eastern pow-
ers NYU and St. Joseph's and
' within these days Davidson's
true strength will be exposed.

’Cats To Meet

Stan McKenzie, though, has
been the real workhorse—tally-
ing 22.5 points while picking off
12.8 rebounds per contest. Bruce
Kaplan and Richard Dyer are
also averaging in double figures
while a pair of sophs—Charlie
Silen and Gary Witrock—share
the pivot position. Although the
Violets’ report card shows fail-
ures in seven games, three were
decided by a total of six points.
They defeated West Virginia 104-
91.

Everyone is back from that
team, and this year they have
blasted their way to a 15-4 rec-
ord, paced by a relentless pres-
sure defense. They are led by
Matt Guokas, a 6-5 playmaker
with tremendous talent, and Cliff
Anderson, a 64 center who con-
sistently outrebounds taller foes.
Other starters have been Tom
Duff, Billy Oakes, and either
Marty Ford or Chuck McKenna.

team in the land before consecu-
tive road losses to Brigham

Freshmen Roundballers Beat Duke,
Scare Carolina In Hectic Week

By YATES FAISON
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Putting forth their great-

est effort of the season, the
Wildkittens came close to
pulling off back-to-back up-
set victories. Brilliant team
play beat Duke’s Imps Sat-
urday, 87-84. and threaten-
ed to catch undefeated
UNC, before bowing, 80-76.
“The boys did a real great
job."" commented Coach Terry
Holland. ‘In the Duke game.
we played well in the clutch
down 'to the wire. We made the
free throws and got :the ball
when we needed it. We got the
second shofs and hit the boards
well. It was a team effort.”
“Against UNC, we played a
good game despite a few costly
mistakes. We did well rebound.
ing despite their tremendous
height advantage. Our defense

did an excellent job. Although .

they got 80. points, ‘most came
from foul shots at:the end. Our
scoring attack was again bal-
anced.”

Holland poinied out that no
single plaver was respons:ble
for the great team spirit and
that. spirit had been high
throughout practice. He praised
individually all the boys who
played in the two games.

“Rocky Crosswhite did a great
job defensively on Steve Vanden-
burg and Rusty Clark. Dave
Moser contributed a steady floor u

game. Wayne Huckel helped in
the scoring and on defense. Mike
Spann worked inside. drawing a
jot of fouls, Mike O'Neill did a
good job on the boards and in
scoring. Mike Dickens did a

good job when Crosswhite got
EF

into foul trouble ”

O'Neill paced the Wildkittens ji

over Duke with 25 points and
contributed 16 against Carolina.
Wayne. Huekel pumped in 22 |
versus Duke and 18 in the UNC
game. Spann and Moser each
had 16 against UNC. Spann add-
ing 19 against Duke..

losing streak, the longest
since 1962, by beating a
quick, hustling VMI quintet,
97-84, Saturday.

The game was close until the
last few-minutes, but the ‘Cats,
having a day to lick their West
Virginia wounds, played a loose,
relaxed style of ball. Davidson
led by only five a the half, but
midway in the second period
Dick Snyder hit six points in 95
seconds to break open the game.
After that the game was never
really in doubt. although the
Keydets managed to pull within
three before the gun sounded.

Although Snyder hit 14 of 22 ©

from the floor and had a total
of 33 points for the night, it
was his teammates that carried
much of the load, something
that did not happen in the West
Virginia game. Rod Knowles,
Tom Youngdale, and Bobby

’ Lane all scored in double fig-
with Knowles and Lane ;

ures,
scoring 19 while Youngdale add-

t ed 16.

Not to be forgotten were Phil
Squier and Pinky Hatcher. Both
controlled the ball well, and both
played excellent defense. Hatch-
er did a particularly good job.
as he came from the bench to
replace Squier, who sustained a

bruised shoulder in the rough ~

action under the boards.
The Keydets’ Charlie Schmaus,

! who scored 31 points for sec-

ond honors. with the aid of
guards Jack Kemper and Robin
18 and 23 points re-
spectively, kept the game ‘‘inter-
esting.””

After the game Coach Lefty
Driesel!l, visibly relieved, said.

through the second-half effort of
Squier that the evening was
saved. Squier accumulated 18
points with most of them com-
ing in the second stanza.

The ‘Cats are now 15-4 for
the season and are 10-1 in' the
family, while Richmond is 8-10
overall and 6-7 in the confer-
ence.

have to go to Ronnie Stone.”

Although not a starter, the 6-3 senior from Ker-
nersville has lettered every year so far in his varsity
career. As a sophomore he alternated at the guard
spot on Davidson's nationally-ranked team, scoring
73 points and snagging 33 rebounds. Last season
Stone accounted for 71 points and 41 rebounds.

“Ronnie has been one of our top reserves for the
past three years,” remarked Driesell. “He is a de-
pendable ball handler with good height, speed, and
a good shooting eye. And he’s tough on the boards.
We can always count on him for a good performance
