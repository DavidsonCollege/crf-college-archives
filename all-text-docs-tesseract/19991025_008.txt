IdnEgo — Relationship advice for
friends and family, foes and lovers

AskIDNEGo@ HormaiL.Com

IdnEgo are Freud’s psychoanalytic voices
that influence all relationship decisions. Id, who
represents the unconscious and licentiousness in
all of us, rarely agrees with Ego, who touts the
conscious and morally-aware course of action.
Tune in each week to hear them face off against
each other as they analyze your relationship and
provide counsel.

Want to hear what IdnEgo have to say about
your relationship dilemma? Or have any com-
ments about their advice? Send your questions
and thoughts to: AskIdnEgo@ hotmail.com. All
inquiries will be kept confidential. (Please note:
All advice offered in this column is purely for
entertainment purposes and should not be con-
sidered professional clinical advice.)

Dear IdnEgo,

I can’t believe that I’m actually writing into
this column, but you were the first one I thought
of when I began having this problem. What do I
have to lose? You see, I am fighting an inner
battle within myself: I believe that I have feelings
for someone significantly older than I, and I
immaturely sent this person an anonymous gift as
a way of showing my affection. Should I come
clean and let this person know everything that I
would like to do to them (sic) behind closed
doors, or should I remain silent, in fear of ridi-
cule?

Signed, Anonymous

Dear “Anonymous,”

OK, you've gotten in the game by sending
the mystery gift. Nice move, but-a little too
conservative for Id. Now, just get on with it—it’s
time to expose yourself (if you know what I
mean). This person probably can’t wait to find

out who sent the gift — enough already building up
the anticipation. Foreplay is over—putt through.
Behind the door, in front of the door, on top of the
door, underneath the door—just don’t keep staring
at the door. Go through it.

Id only has one warning. Do NOT go through
the door if this person is married (especially if the
last name ends in a vowel). Listen to Id on this one
— Id once had to move halfway across the country
and take the alias Ed for six months. Those few
good memories — ok, GREAT memories — just
weren't worth the form-fitting cement shoes.

In your best interest, Id
2K KK

Dear “Anonymous,”

Forget anonymity! It’s time to put your ego
on the line. Look, what’s the worst that’s going to
happen if you “come clean?” Rejection? Let’s be
honest here — rejection is not that bad. On the
other hand, the best thing that could happen is that
the two of you will get together and live happily
ever after (cue the sunset and the music). There
are, of course, a whole range of other possibilities
between these two scenarios. The point is — by
remaining silent, you'll never know what could
have happened with this other person. (Before you
come clean, though, you might want to ask your-
self a few questions: Does this person know you
exist? Is this person married? Does this person
have a significant other? Ego agrees with Id on this
one—it’s not a good idea to pursue this if this
person is married, vowel or no vowel.) Otherwise,
Ego says go for it! Be bold: Take a risk. You'll
never know if you don't.

Your friend, Ego
