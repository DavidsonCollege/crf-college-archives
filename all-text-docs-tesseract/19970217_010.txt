Movie Review

Small
wonders
astound

By ANNE STANCI

Guest Writer

Our hero struggles with the
weight ofan object twice his size.
When it seems as though he suc-
ceeds in this arduous task, the
massive sphere becomes trapped
by an evil protrusion in the earth.
Struggling to free his prize, our
hero once again tries to push the
object over the rocky terrain.
Sound like a new Sylvester
Stallone flick? Actually, I just
described a scene from Micro-
cosmos where a dung beetle tries
to push a ball of dirt to his abode.

Microcosmos is anew film
about the hidden world of bugs.
A movie all about bugs? Sounds
like a banal biology video or Sun-
day night National Geographic
special. Actually, the film is the
first in a series of art and indepen-
dent films cosponsored by the
Mint Museum of of Art, WFAE,
and the Carolina Pavilion AMC
22 Theaters. Students get into
these shows for only $3! Micro-
cosmos centers entirely on in-
sects and arachnids. When I first

stomach turned at the notion. This
bug-phobic would rather watch
Harrison Ford save the universe.
Still, I was intrigued with this
movie and decided to see the bugs
for myself.

This film took years to cre-
ate because of the minute pho-
tography — photography so pre-
cise that the individual feet of a
caterpillar can be seen gripping a
twig. Insects and arachnids of all
sorts are the stars of Microcos-
mos; the only human interference
is brief narration. The red of the
ladybugs and green of the grass-
hoppers have such a mesmeriz-
ing power that I forgot I was
supposed to be squeamish around
creepy-crawly creatures. Surpris-
ingly, like any of its Hollywood
counterparts, Microcosmos offers
adventure, violence, and even sex
for the movie going crowd.
Memorable scenes include the
climax of a snail love affair anda
fight between two beetles dis-
playing their machismo.

These small but beautiful
creatures were generous to let
humans catch a glimpse into their
exciting world. This film taught
me a great lesson (aside from the
would-be-cliche “bugs are beau-
tiful’”). Our world is filled with
miracles that never noticed: the
birth of a honeybee or the meta-
morphosis of a caterpillar into a
butterfly are incredible, spiritual
occurrences. Microcosmos
teaches us to stop and look around
at our world. Perhaps now when
I see a six-legged creature scur-
rying across the floor, I will think
twice before snuffing out its vastly
significant life, greatly dispro-

learned about Microcosmos, my |,

Mud flies on stage

Actors emerge clean from messy script

By SARAH ZOGBY
Guest Writer

Walking into the Black Box
Theater last Thursday evening to
watch Mud, I was met by the sounds
of a distorted animal kingdom.

The play by Maria Irene Fornes
was directed by Ann Marie Costa
and starred Mike Miga, Kay
Walraven, and Jose Ruiz with the
set, lighting, and sound designed by
Ronnie Higdon.

And what a set it was. The
stage slanted at a near 40 degree
angle reflecting the unstable world
in which the characters in Mud live.
Splattered in browns and reds and
appearing to be caked in dirt, the set
reminded me of a pig pen as record-
ings of grunting animals played in
the background.

The play was divided into short
clips that were woven together to
tell the tale of a lonely woman try-
ing desperately to dig herself out of
a wold of animalness in which she
found herself. Each short scene
ended with a dramatic lighting
change freezing the characters in
stilled snapshot poses and proving
very dramatic and effective.

In an extremely strong perfor-

mance, Mike Miga played Lloyd, a
mentally stunted young man who
exhibited infantile and animal-like

behavior. Mike seemed to be prac-

tically living inside of the body of
his character.

In fact, Mike’s constant nose
picking, nail-biting and dog-crawl-
ing seemed to look second nature
(hmm?).

Kay’s Mae provided the piv-
otal drama of the play; a woman
trapped between two men who com-
pletely suck the life out of her. Kay
was able to portray the Mae’s con-
flicting dual nature, a woman des-
perately needing to escape versus a
woman intensely fearful of separat-
ing from all she ever known and
loved.

In Henry, José found a man
who became entirely unmasked and
revealed to his core. Henry’s piv-
otal masturbation scene was acted
with grace. What could have’been
portrayed as a ‘vulgar and porno-
graphic scene was, through José’s
performance, a scene revealing the
depths of loneliness to which Henry
had sunk.

Despite the strong performance
of the actors, I found the script a
little weak in places. The hermit

crab and starfish analogies were too
cliché to be powerful. Even so, I
found myself almost moved to tears
on a few occasions, a mark to me of
a good performance (though, I must

admit, I am a crier.).

All in all, I think the combined
efforts of Ann Marie’s directing, «
Ronnie’s set and lighting, and a
great cast of actors made Mud work.

Frosted with flare and fired with fury

Mint Museum shows glass and ceramic artwork

By Amy CLEMMONS
Guest Writer

As the popularity of contem-
porary glass continues torise, works
of artists like Richard Jolley, now
exhibiting at the Mint Museum,
become increasing more complex
and visually enriched. His show of
frosted glass sculptures combines
the medium’ s infinite range of color
in three-dimensional form with en-
ticing tactile surfaces. By etching
the glass in a hydrochloric acid,
Jolley’s milky surfaces sensually
entice the eye and beg for further
explanation. The sculptures subjects
range from the comical of dogs and
heads with baseball caps to issues
dealing with race and feminism.

One particularly poignant
piece, Same Skin, Different Color,
involves two heads of transparent
glass, one filled with salt and the
other with pepper. Here Jolley por-
trays the theme of transparent skin
while also suggesting that the sub-
stance of a person lies within.

In works like Circling
Thoughts, Jolley begins with ahead
surmounted by a transparent orb
with a pair of frosted birds. The
engaging use of circular patterns
‘replays itself throughout the show
andinvokes more psychological and
fantastical interpretations.

Jolley, as a master of his me-
dium, is uniquely aware of the al-

formed glass with salt and

luring properties of glass. He often
uses its sensual beauty as a play
against the more mundane subject
matter. Jolley also understands the
possibilities of a medium just be-
ginning to receive proper critical
attention and his sculptures are carry
forceful messages within their fro-
zen, lavish textures.

The main show playing the at
the Mint Museum is required for
anyone with a slight interest in pot-
tery. “The Ceramic Art of North
Carolina” includes over 250 pieces
from two centuries of potters work-
ing in three main areas of the state.

The most prolific area,
Seagrove, is located just south of
Ashboro, amere75 miles from here.
Over 100 pottery shops fill this area,
providing a unique day trip for any-
one willing to talk with the artists
and find great treasures for small
prices.

The show itself incorporates
families of potters who have been
throwing clay in North Carolina
since the early. 1700s and moves
through the evolution of the tradi-
tion. While remaining functional,
the pots have changed forms, ac-
quired faces, moved into more deco-

rative uses, and been sought out by
many faithful supporters.

Subject matter varies as well,
and the history of a state tied to red
clay emerges as an overall theme.
The presentation of the show is quite
excellent and the immense amount
of material is organized expertly.

The Mint is open from 10 a.m.
Until 10 p.m. on Tuesdays, 10 a.m.
until 5 a.m. Wednesdays thru Sun-
days. Its only $2 to get in and well
worth the trip. Guides to the
Seagrove area can be found in the

library. Go check out the glass and
clay! :
