TAR HEELS OVERCOME

(Continued on page 6)

However, Peabody fumbled after being tackled
hard, and Gilbreath recovered for Carolina.
After a series of line bucks, a pass, and an end
run, Croom faked to Chandler and sprinted 30
yards for the first score of the game. The sec-
ond score came after Pearce had kicked 61
yards deep in Carolina’s territory. Slusser made
15 yards, and, on the next play Ferebee slipped
through tackle and raced 65 yards for the sec-
ond touchdown. .

The Wildcats threatened in the first and last
quarters, but were held on the 20-yard line
the first time, and were unable to make any

passes good in a desperate attempt to score in |

the last minutes of the game.

Gardner, blond Davidson center, was out-
standing for the Wildcats and broke through
time and again to break up the Tar Heel forma-
tion ‘before it could get under way. Wagner
and Johnson also had a hand in many plays,

playing the best defensive games for the ’Cats.

will be done away with, and because of that,
we will be able to crucify the evil in our own
hearts. When wickedness is driven out, natur-

that we will be able to help others and assist

“They keep tasting better
and better to me!”’

Every Chesterfield is like every other one.
No matter how many you smoke, the last
Chesterfield of the day.is just as smooth and
sweet—as cool and comfortable—as the first.

They’re milder, too! Chesterfield uses
only mild, ripe, sweet tobaccos—the smooth-
est and ripest that grow.

Notice, too, how whité and fine the paper
is. It’s the purest that money can buy.

All this care...to make Chesterfields taste
better—to make them milder. And millions
of Chesterfield smokers say it in their own
way—‘‘ They Satisfy !”’

GOOD... .they’ve got to be good!
