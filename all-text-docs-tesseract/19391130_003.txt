re

of the Week Unity. Christmas Plans

_. After_a_long and heated discus-_
sich As tor who would play the. an-
nual Turkey Day ‘classic in Char-

lotte. Wake Forest has a. 15-year
contract. in) —Memorial Stadium.
Since that was announced there
dias been much discussion as to
what

future for her Thanksgiving ODay
game. —

Here are a few of the popular ,
opinions as to what team and where _
Davidson should play on Turkey
Day in future years:

Charlie Mashburn, Senior:

My choice is Washington and. Lee
to-be played either=in Winston: -
Salem or Greetisboro, The big thing
is to gel a selol about the same!
size -as Davidson and a_ location
which is about equidistant from
the two schools.

Jim Morgan, Sophomore:
——Hll-take- State-in—\Vinston- Salem_!
It is alwavs a good ganic and the |.
Ww i nstan people seem to support
Davidson after a large fashion. |
Bill Squires, Sophomore: ‘
State vs.
boro would be a real classic. Their
teams and ours are usually well: |
matched and Greensboro is an ¢x-"
cellent location because of the
abundance of girls’ schools to
iurnish dates for the gate.

Rhea Tenney, Senior:

What Davidson needs is a big
Thanksgiving celebration here on
the campus. 1 would favor playing,
Washington and Lee here in years
to come on Thanksgiving. We don't
have dances on the campus to draw
crowds and there are few concerts
or other programs given) whith
bring visitors to the campus; why
not make the W. and 1. game the
biggest celtbration of the year next
to homecoming.

John McGee, Freshman:

yame that the Citadel |
game would make an exeéllent Tur-
key Day claésic. [1 would be best
td play it here (and. 1 believe offi-

—einh—ot-the GCitudel—weouldtke
to have it here), because of
fact that Citadel games draw com-
paratively small crowds Char-
leston.

It seems

the
in

Dave Spencer, Sophomore:

Winston-Salem is my choice by
far for the location of our Thanks-
giving Day game, regardless of who
we play. 1 would like to play V.4
M. -. there, 1 believe. The people ;
it seems to be excellent Davidson
supportersyand it's a big help to the
tea to have that sort of a. crowd.
Charlie Luther, (Senior: |

Davidson should try to schedule
either W. and-L., Vs-M.-L. or Center
for the Thanksgiving Day game.;
_If_it.could be arranged we should
try: to play the game here on the
campus every year. Davidson needs
some other annual celebration to
bring visitors and old grads to thed

campus besides homecoming.
Dan Gilliam, Senior:
It would be fine if we could!

“$chedule an annual game with the!
_ Citadel, Hampton-Sidney, or Se='
wanee dor Thanksgiving Day. 1
would like to see it played in Char- |
lotte, but since that is out, I think }
a—-we-should_ alternate. and play on:

fo

our own campus every other year.' Riker and Mrs. Thomas Byrd, of: Gales McClintock, -Marvin_Pennitig-;!
Poss dee —eeturned to his alma mater as foot.

Gene ‘Shannon, Sophomore:

I'd like to play V. M. Lin Win-
ston-Salem. That, game is always?

a fight for both tcams and Win-
ston surely is a Davidson town. |
—— Geddie—Herring;—_Sophomore:
I'd like to see us play V. M. L:
in Winston. That would be neutral _
——#round-and-it_would-be a4 real game.

“Hot play thet ainital classic there |
Ed Watson, Junior: '
1 would favor playing thé Cita-'
-del—here—on—Thanksgiving._L_be-
lieve that that game-will always

be~a ‘close one_because the_ two"
schools are about the same. size |
iand.- neither one, seems anxious to!
start a big subsidizing: program.
Paul Bumbarger, Junior:

Although few people seem to
agree with me, I would like to see
us play either Hanipton. Sidney,
Vv. M. L. or V. P. I. Naturally it
would be easier to schedule that
game for some location between
the two schools so my vote goes to
Greensboro., Our games there have
drawn good crowds.

Ralph Williams, Sophomore:

I think that Winston-Salem is the
logical spdt for the game. The
ches Davidson alumni there have always
i been strong Davidson supporters.
