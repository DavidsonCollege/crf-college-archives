Chris Wyrick
exhibits himself

By Jonathan Brooks

Rushing to the Union cafe for
that quick break between classes,
students may have noticed a col-
lection of self-portraits in the Union
lobby. Taking the time to observe
the works, you’ll find Chris
Wyrick’s senior honors exhibit.
This show is one of two shows that
constitute part of Wyrick’s honors
program, the second of which will
appear in the Smith Gallery in the
VAC during the spring.

Although Wyrick was inter-
ested in artwork throughout high
school, he felt that he did not gain
his perspective on art as a vocation
rather than a hobby until college.
He attributes his change in attitude
to his work here and the facilities
provided by the new art building.
Wyrick has now been painting for
three years and is currently en-
rolled in an independent study for
his senior honors program.

The senior honors for studio
art requires the completion of 100

works over the course of the se-:

mester. Wyrick’s independent
study with Herb Jackson focuses
on works on paper, and he decided
to concentrate more specifically
on the self-portrait as the subject

for these works. Much of his ear-
lier work has been purely abstract
or formal in nature, but Wyrick felt
that spending this past summer in
Italy had some influence on his
decision to paint figurative works.

Someone walking through the
show might be curious as to why
Wyrick chose to focus on the self-
portrait for his exhibition. Ac-
cording to him, “‘Self-portraits are
a way to work figuratively, di-
rectly. When you want to deal
with the human form, there you
are, There’s no real narcissism or
complex involved here.” There
are some paintings which reduce
the self-portraits to small parts of
the compositions, while the larger
part of the paintings concentrates
on abstract design. Wyrick says
that these paintings are an investi-
gation of what he was doing before
this year.

According to Wyrick, some
of the works in the'show definitely
exude phallic references. He ex-
plains that this first came about
naturally since the way in which
the images were framed tends to
suggest this phallic reference. He

particularly acknowledges this ten-

dency in Onomatopoeia and Self-

Wyrick’s paintings cover a
wide variety of styles, media, and
techniques. Some of the works are
monochromatic and minimal in
their use of paint while others are
polychromatic and focus on the
build-up of paint. He explains that
in some of the paintings he decided
to center on the reduction of the
paint, which he accomplished ei-
ther through water or turpentine.
Wyrick took advantage of this ex-
perimental aspect of the show to
work with different media, such as
tempera, oil, pencil, oil crayon,
and etching.

Chris Wyrick’s show runs in
the Union gallery through Novem-
ber 6.

Do we fit the new national statistics, or do we deviate ?

have let sexual freedom and ex-
pressiveness slip away with the
60’s and 70’s, and have adopted a
new code of restraint and mo-
nogamy.

We at The Davidsonian won-
der, though, has the low, romantic
lighting totally disappeared, oris it
just being outshone by the Baby
Boomers who have gotten tired?
A survey circulated last week
among seniors has given us our
Own results to compare to
Chicago’s, relative to the experi-
ences of those enrolled at Davidson.
What they reveal is that, yes, the
mattress is no longer put to the test
as much as in former decades, but
the bedroom is still a titillating
place to be.

Virginity

Itstarted with giggles and dirty
pictures in 6th grade, and evolved
into empty gestures of machismo
and womanly maturity in junior
high. Youknew kids in high school
who had done it, and you were
impressed, jealous, and intimi-
dated. You talked about it in the
bathroom as if you knew anything
about what you were saying, and

bragged about that guy from Camp ~

Muskogee or that girl from Niagara
Falls. But it was still.a mystery.
Then all of a sudden you ended up
on Pat’s couch and there was this
thing in front of you that you used
to draw pictures of in 6th grade.
For some, that moment came
very early. The Chicago report
says that by 15, half of black males
have lost their virginity, and two
years later half the white males
take the plunge. Here at Davidson,
14% of males lose their virginity at
15 or before. The largest group,

18%, wait until they are 17, sow-
ing that first wild oat while still in
high school, and 27% do it within
the first two years of college.

For women, 18 is the most
popular age, with 24% having sex
for the first time as they register to
vote, and 28% doing it sometime
in ‘college. 10% got a jump on
everyone else and lost it at 15,
while 20% figured they had better
get it out of the way before high
school graduation.

Chicago states that the rea-
sons for having sex the first time
vary greatly, from 4% of males
saying they felt significant peer

pressure to do it to 24% of women
saying they were curious. The
most prevalent answers at
Davidson go along with Chicago’s
results, but the percentages are
higher in most categories. 62% of
women lost their virginity in an
embrace of affection, 26% were
curious, and 16% just wanted to
feel good. The men said the fol-
lowing: 32% for affection, 27%
for curiosity, and 36% for plea-
sure.

There are some of us who are
still waiting for Pat, however.
