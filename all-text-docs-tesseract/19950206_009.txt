THE DAVIDSONIAN:

OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1995 9

Anger is defined as:“‘a feeling
of extreme displeasure, hostility,
_ indignation, or exasperation toward
someone or something; rage;
wrath; ire.” In any arena where
conflict is prevalent, anger plays a
major role. Expression is difficult
because a delicate balance has to
be established.
The expression of too much
anger breaks down lines of com-
munication and creates a hostile

environment. It creates more an- ;

ger. If left unexpressed, it builds
and eventually evolves into vio-
lence. In order to understand race
relations, we need to understand
anger. So, what is the most effec-
tive way to express anger and still
achieve progress?

Many African-Americans feel
and express anger—some through
words, some through a passive-
aggressive stance, some through

forgetting. Others, unfortunately,
through violence. When African-
Americans vent any form of anger,
they open themselves up to several
stereotypes. Some will see it as
proof of the “violent, animal-like”
stereotype. Some will see the lazy
stereotype (they’ re just looking for
a hand-out!). Some will certainly:
see those particular individuals as
“trouble-makers,”

When we see such a large
group of people expressing anger,
however, we must also see legiti-
mate causes, The anger being ex-
pressed is notshown to create sym-
pathy. This expression fights in-

justices. This expression comes
from a desire to no longer be an-
gry. No one wants to constantly
defend himself against other
people’s fears. No one wants to be
viewed as a trouble-maker. No
one wants to be angry!

But the truth remains, we are
angry. We are angry because of
past events and present discrimi-
nation. Weare angry because of
our lack of recognition as true first-
class citizens. We are angry be-
cause of unfair treatment and inhu-
mane biases. We are angry be-
cause we have no other choice.
Unmistakenly, we are angry.

This is where the difficulty
begins. When we express this an-
ger, we create more fear, which in
turn creates more anger. When I
express anger in my articles, [know
the tension and apprehension it
may create. Yet, if [did notexpress
this anger, there would be no
progress. I would be adding to the
already false belief of the perfect
world.

Anger needs to be expressed
in a constructive, straightforward

‘manner. A lack of anger in these

writings would show a lack of hon-
esty. The expression of anger is
important because it allows truth.

But to focus on the anger being
expressed is shallow. The focus
has to be on the cause of that anger.
Why are they discontented? What
can be done to change these feel-
ings? Who does this anger affect?
Where did it originate?

Expecting an African-Ameri-
can to be perfectly content in this
society is unrealistic. Expecting
him to vent his anger in aconstruc-
tive, non-obtrusive way has to be
expected because there is no
“middle-ground” with anger. Ei-
ther it makes you stronger, or it
tears you down. And too many
African-Americans have been torn
down because of it. It’s time to be
realistic. If we don’t, I believe we
all know what happens to bottled-
up ension

| have to sit where?

I guess it’s true — I’m grow-
ing into a grumpy old man. There
are some things that seem to set me
off, no matter how seemingly in-
significant: deodorant that doesn’t
deodorize, people who sit in the
turn lane and don’ tturn, and people
who wear their shorts so long that
they look like knickers. But these
will have to wait. Although these
issues concern us all, they make

Where I have a problem is in
the arbitrary assignment of seat
locations in the student section.
When the student enters the arena,
the nice ticket lady or man just
hands the student the next ticket on
the stack. :

Last game I was early — one
of the first 30 students there (I had
to get a good seat for the Daredev-
ils). My ticket stub said row I, seat

Sorry, I’m getting emotional.
Let me just say that if the Davidson
ticket people are going to hand out
tickets to students without asking
them where they want to Sit, then
the student section should be open
seating. I was one of the first
people there! Why dol get a worse
seat than the guy who gets there
five minutes before tip off? Maybe
there’s something here I don’t un-

for rather dull Opinions ar-
ticles, and we don’t need any
more of those.

To cut to the chase, I’m
most irritated by the goings-
on in the John Belk Arena —
specifically how the student
section is run at the men’s
varsity basketball games (as
Ihave unfortunately made it

derstand.

Another problem with the
student section (I empha-
size the student part of that
phrase) is the Crazy (oh, so
crazy) CatClub. Youknow
the ones — about a dozen
students who paid $10 for
a red T-shirt and a front
row seat in our section. At

to only a few of the women’s
games, I am not an authority on
their student section).

For those of you who have
never made it to a guy’s basketball
game, letme give you the lowdown.
You walk in, show your Cat Card,
and receive a ticket (the locals buy
their tickets at the window). Now,
each ticket has a seat location, but
students get seats in the student
section, and locals get tickets for
seats elsewhere.

10. Unfamiliar with that seat? Oh,
it’s in the student section, but the
last row with a total of two seats in
that row. Sure, I only have one
friend, but I suckered a few others’
to “hang out” with me. So we sat

down a few rows closer to the .

court. The place began filling up,

-and of course, five minutes before
tip off, the ticket holders for our
seats butted us out. I was ticked off
to say the least.

one game, row three was
entirely vacant within a minute
before the game started.

I sat there, only to have Burt,
leader of the oh-so-Crazy Cats, ask
me ever so politely tomove. “These
seats are reserved,” he said. Three
rows? A dozen or so active mem-
bers, andthree rows? Again, maybe
there is something I’m missing.
Do most schools have the students
pay to sit in the student section? I
honestly don’t know. Why not

rhe

have the Crazy Cats sit in the front
row of the end zone? Or, better
yet, why not row I?

Anyway, inconclusionI think
the increasing popularity of
Davidson basketball has caught
those in charge a bit off guard. The

student section should be open and
remain free to those of us who pay
$20,000. Once the game starts, It
anyone should be allowed to sit in
the designated Crazy Cat Club
rows, or else have the club move to
another section and go wild there.

Thank you from the
bottom of our lungs.

Finally. We can all. breath
easier knowing that our school has
removed a huge health hazard from
our everyday lives. The number
one cause of cancer and several

‘dozen other diseases is no longer

present in the place we go to learn.
NO SMOKING IN CHAMBERS.

It is a great first step taken by
the college, and it needs to be heart-
ily congratulated for looking out
for the well-being of the students.
It would be so easy to just continue
to look the other way (especially in
a state whose Senator has decided
that because he was paid off by the
tobacco lords he will stop U.S.
research into tobacco).

I thought at a time of joy like
this, it would be beneficial to point
out to the student body just what
President Kuykendall has saved us
from.

Approximately 3,000 inno-
cent people die from cancer caused
by second-hand smoke each year.
An estimated 419,000 people die
each year from diseases caused by
smoking. Smoking is responsible
for an estimated one in five U.S.
deaths and costs the U.S. atleast 65
billion dollars in health care ex-
penses and lost productivity per

year, Cigarette smoke contains 43

distinct cancer-causing chemicals
and is responsible for 87% of lung
cancer cases and most cases of
emphysema and bronchitis. It is
also one of the leading causes of
heart disease and strokes (accord-
ing to studies done by the Ameri- +
can Lung Association and Surgeon
General). Guys, that cigarette af-
ter sex takes on a whole new mean-
ing, since male smokers are 50%
more likely to be impotent than
non-smokers.

Cigarettes are one of a few
legal substances sold in the U.S,
that, if taken correctly, will accel-
erate death. This is allowed in part
because of the “generous contri-
butions” to government officials,
by the tobacco industry and be-
cause of an advertising campaign
in excess of four-billion dollars a
year (which can conveniently be
deducted from their taxes).

Thank you, Dr. Kuykendall,*
for saving us from these risks and
putting the welfare of the students
above all else in making your deci-
sion. We are looking forward to
the time when you make the place
where “smoking has [the greatest]
potential impact on those nearby”
(the dorms) free “from the hazards
of passive smoke" as well.
