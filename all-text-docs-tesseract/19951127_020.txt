On a life-long»

mission to expose the abuses |

in Chinese prisons, Harry Wu has
become “the voice of China’s conscience.”

November 13, 1995

While you were growing up, who
particularly influenced your later
political involvement?

Most Chinese families are not in-
volved in politics. But I received
two different influences. The first
was my father. My father is a
banker. He could have left China
to become a rich man in Hong
Kong. But he said, “This is my
homeland, and I will stay.” That
was one very basic influence to
me, to love your country and work
hard by yourself. The second one
was a Catholic priest. He was
Italian. We had become very good
friends. He took care of me a lot
when I was in middle school, in
1949 or 1950. He was an old man,
and he was very kind. I learned to
love and learned about God from
him.

What were the circumstances that
led to your initial arrest in 1960?

I was a so-called “‘counterrevolu-
tionary” for about 2 1/2 years. I
had no liberty. I could continue
my study, but I was under the
party’s surveillance. Until 1960
the whole country had a big prob-
lem—starvation. Many people
died and left their hometown and
their family to seek food and travel
around the country. There was a
very serious political crisis. The
party tried to control the situation.
They set up lots of labor camps. I
was arrested under this back-
ground.

Were you given a trial?

No, it was just an arrest, so-called
re-educational labor. I was taken
directly from the school to the de-
tention center.

Describe the living conditions at
' the prison.

I was subject to hard labor. We
_ were in dormitories one by one,
everybody had two-foot-wide
spaces. Ten people were orga-
nized and became a squadron.
There were 10 or 15 squadrons
together as acompany. There were
three to five policemen controlling
each company. Each squadron
selected one prisoner as a leader to
control the other prisoners and the
labor. So every day we would go
to the fields to work on the farm. If
you worked in a factory you had
your shift to go to work. It was
seven daysa week, 30daysa month.

Were there any experiences in .

your nineteen years of prison that

particularly stand out?

They took my former inmate’s
body to the graveyard. He was
Chen Ming, a very nice guy. I
found out that the graveyard was
huge. All of [the graves] were
unmarked and unrecognized. We
don’t know how many people were
dead. And felt, “Does life mean
nothing, just like a cigarette ash?”
If lives mean nothing, the society
means nothing. If society means
nothing, the country means noth-
ing. This political system has to be
changed.

Did you suffer any physical harm

while imprisoned?

Yes, every day, because we did not
have enough food. We hada ration
of cornmeal, and the ration related
to your labor and political perfor-
mance. There was a basic daily

problem because of the food. We:

didn’t have sugar, milk, or cook-
ing oil. Maybe two days a month
we had two pieces of pork meat.

How did your imprisonment af-
fect your religious beliefs?

There were no religious beliefs

I tried to get my Chinese passport
for about four years.

You returned to China twice in
1991 and once in 1994. How were
you able to return?

I got a visa from the Chinese gov-
ernment and legally went. But
when I travel in China I have a
different position according to the
situation. I pose as a businessman,
a tourist, a common person, a
prisoner’s family member, or a
policeman.

How do you gather information?

First of all we have to identify how
many prison camps there are and
their population. Then we inter-
view many survivors. We inter-
view policemen, judges, doctors,
and patients. They come: from
different camps, different posi-
tions, different ages, and different
times. If you put these people’s
stories together, you get the whole
picture. I learned from the
Tianamen Square incident that TV
had a very important role in expos-
ing the movement. SoI want touse

Harry Wu, 58, has dedicated
his life to raising awareness of
conditions in Chinese prisons. Wu
was born in 1937 in Shanghai, the
son of a wealthy banker. After
attending a Jesuit boys school,
Wu studied geology at Beijing’s
Geology Institute. During a pe-
riod of political openness, Wu
criticized government policies.
He was arrested in 1960 without

discussed in China, particularly in
the camps. This was a reactionary
thought. No one talked about reli-
gion in the prison camps. I was
baptized when I was 11 years old
as a Catholic. Religion was totally
destroyed in China after I was four-
teen years old. Once I was in the
camp, there was a point in the
disaster I tried to seek something
to support myself spiritually. I did
some praying, but later I felt kind
of guilty because I shouted to God,
“You told me you are universal,
you love me, you’re concerned
about me, you bless me. Where are
you now? I’minnocent. How can
you help me?”

Why were you released in 1979?

The party had a new leadership
and new policies. I became a
teacher in a university in geology.
I was the head of the laboratory at
the China geoscience university.

How were you allowed to come to
the United States?

I got a release in 1979. It was a
very dangerous political situation
for me. They taught me that I had
a big tail and that you had to grab
your tail between two legs. I gotan
invitation from UC-Berkeley, and

TV as a weapon and a tool. If
you’re writing, that’s pretty easy.
If you want to film something, it’s
more difficult, and you’re seen
more by police.

What abuses did you discover in
the prisons?

The prisoners are forced to labor,
and the Chinese police are forced
to cover it up and try to sell the
products indirectly. Once I posed
as a businessman in the negotia-
tion and they determined that the
products are exported to the United
States. I obtained Chinese docu-
ments in print how to extract or-
gans from the executed prisoners.

How were you captured on your
mostrecent trip to China last July?

By computer. They dialed in my
passport number and they got me.
I was taken away by the secret
police. I traveled around in China
and was finally locked up in a
police guest house. I had a nice
view and good conditions. Police-
men served me and took care of
me. The physical conditions were
okay, but mentally it was horrible.

years, Wu was imprisoned in vari-
ous Chinese detention centers,
learning from others how to sur-
vive meager rations and grueling
labor.

Because of a change in po-

student. After obtaining a teach-
ing position, Wu became deter-
mined to tell the world about the
conditions in Chinese prisons.
Twice in 1991, once in 1994, and
again in 1995, Wu returned to
China, disguising himself to docu-
ment conditions in the prisons,

CBS, the BBC, and60 Minutes,
Wu produced several documen-
taries on the horrifying conditions
he had known while a prisoner.
They show prisoners malnour-
ished in filthy cells, forced to per-
form hard labor in mines and
fields, and compelled to manu-
facture goods exported to the
West. Wu, posing as a business-
man, uncovered evidence that
prisoners’ organs were sold at
immense profits.

Wuis the founder and execu-
tive director of the Laogai Re-
search Foundation in Milpitas,
California, which is dedicated to
exposing Chinese forced-labor
camps. He is also a fellow at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford
University. Wu, a United States
citizen, lives in California with
his wife, Ching-Lee.

No, they spied on me and told me
I would die. They never issued an
arrest warrant. That means they
want to eliminate you. Finally
after 20 days’ they issued an offi-
cial warrant and then condemned
me to 15 years.

How were you treated while you
awaited trial?

The conditions were okay, but three
young lieutenants stayed with me
for24hours. Noradio, no newspa-
per, you cannot make phone calls.
Nobody can call you. My family’s
letter, they were not allowed to
give it to me.

When I wanted to buy. a Chi-
nese law book, I was not allowed.
I was interrogated, but there was

nothing really interesting. They
only took the BBC and CBS re-
ports as the evidence to charge
me—public documentaries.

What motivates you to continue
your work?

I came over here as a scholar at
UC-Berkeley in civil engineering.

I want to forget about the past,
have a good life, turn the page
over, but I can’t.

I cannot forget the past. I
cannot turn my back to these
people. I have to do something for
them.So I became a research fel-
low at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University, and I focused
on exposing Chinese gulags.
