Students, Is Directed

By Miss Hood

SHAW SMITH TO STAR

Play To Be Presented

In Chambers On

Tuesday Night

Red and Black Masquers

are hustling with their pre-
parations for curtain time of

that spine-tingling mystery
drama, “The Blue Ghost,”
which they will present in

Chambers Auditorium on Tues-
day evening, December 10, at
8:00 P. M.

Elaborate Lights

It revealed that
elaborate lighting effects are being
prepared, which will‘add to the eery
atmosphere of the setting. Pro-
fessor Erwin of the English de-
partment has been hard’ at work
planning and constructing the scen-
_ery. Assisting him and_ especially

has been some

interested in the new lighting ex-
periments are Paul Welch and John
Fite Robertson. These improved
background effects are expected
to add much to the attractiveness of
the play.

“Miss Hood Is Directing

Miss Kalista Hood, daughter of
Professor Hood of the faculty, is
director of the play. Her dramatic
experience has been wide, in¢élud-
ing appearances in “You Can't Take
{t With You” and with a Shakes-
peare company for six months,

The Cast

“Colin” Shaw Smythe in the title
role of “The Blue Ghost” will be
supported by an able cast. John
Northcross_will appear_as_Dr. De-
Former, a nevrous, middle-aged man,
who speaks in a sort of off tone.
Doug Swink takes the part of a
half-maniac dope addict.

Jasper, the negro servant upon
whom much of the comedy of the
show depends, will be played by
Tom Milliken: Miss Clara Smith
of Davidson will be a woman news-
paper woman. Ernie Webster will
play the part of a heavy-set, hard-
boiled policeman, Inspector Wise.
Frank Mebane will pose as an ex-
convict, Frank Holt, and Tony Dar-
by will be a stranger.

The plot of the play is-developed
from a situation in which the char-
acters find themselves together in
a -castled house owned by Dr. De-
Former in which a murder has been
committed and which is supposedly
haunted. There are several con-
tacts with the Blue Ghost, who
threatens them over a radio hookup,
not to mention the fact that the
castle is mined with a charge of
TNT. Inspector Wise sets out to
solve the mystery with very comic
results.

Latin’s Fate
Is Extinction

Dr. C. R. Harding, of the ancient
language department at Davidson
College, is asking the social or-
ganizations of North Carolina to
aid in helping promote Latin in
the public schools of the -state.

In a recent letter to the editor
of one of the state’s largest news-
“papers, Dr. Harding tells of the way
in which the Latin language is
rapidly losing ground in the cur-
ricula of the schools. He stated
that the modern languages, French,
Spanish, and German, are competing
with Latin and more students are
choosing these instead~of’ Latin.

The Latin professor puts the
blame jointly on the parents of the
students who are, ignorant of the
value of Latin, and on the neglect
or indifference of the state school
officials. He says that these of-
fiicials should know what is best

Military Frat
May Have To
Be Disbanded

Constitution Provides For
Its Inactivity In Time Of
Conflict.

Since the outbreak of the
present struggle between the
United States and Japan,
rumors have been circulating
around the campus concerning
the disbandment of the Scab-
bard and Blade.

In the constitution of the hon-
orary military fraternity there
a section providing for the organi-
zation’s inactivity in time of nat-
tional confiict. It not certain
whether this will apply to the pres-
ent situation.

World War I

Inthe last World War, the
Scabbard and Blade was disbanded
because all’ the cadet officers who

is

is

composed the organization were
immediately inducted into active
service,

The war in which we are now in-
volved is of such a nature that our
navy and air force will be the main

participants. This being true, the

army will probably not be called
on to any large extent unless the
situation becomes more compli-
cated,
Walter Wooten

Walter Wooten, lieutenant-col-
onel of the Davidson R. O. T. C.
Batallion, said that “now is the
time that this organization should
be active. Not only does it create

an interest in military, but it is an
incentive for the men in R. O. T. C.
to strive to bé better officers. In
these ways it is thought that the
Scabbard and Blade will be a help
instead of a hindrance to our gov-
ernment.

“In view of these facts it is
hoped that the national hedquar-
ters might revoke this section of
the constitution and allow the
Scabbard and Blade to remain an
active organization.”

At present the local chapter has
already tapped new members “and
will continue as usual until further
orders have been received from
headquarters.

Freshman Is

Badly Burned

Jack Horschel burned
iously Thursday afternoon, Decem-
ber 4, by the explosion of potassium
nitrate, red phosphorus, and sulfur
while mixing them in his room.

Seated at his desk, Horschel be-
gan to slowly stir the chemicals
with his fingers. The friction of
this action caused the highly com-
bustable phosphorus to explode.

The sudden explosion and flar-
ing up of the chemicals burned
Horschel’s chest and face badly,
blowing off the front of his shirt
and sweater. Realizing his body
was on fire, he grabbed a coat and
extinguished the sulfer bubbles
which were all over him. After
putting out the flame on his bed
he went to the infirmary where he
received medical attention. An
was applied to his face
to prevent, if possible, scar tissués.

An ambulance was called from
Mooresville which carried him to
the Charlotte Memorial Hospital,
where an eye specialist as well as
cther doctors “were “consulted” to
determine his condition. His eyes
are all right, the doctors think.

Horschel said, “I didn’t sleep at
all the first night. Seeing the gray-
nes of dawn, I though I had lost
my eyesight. After waiting a
couple of hours I saw the sun-
light and was greatly. relieved.”

U.S.S. NORTH CAROLINA RECEIVES BIBLES

The following letter was received
this morning from Captain O. C.

Commanding Officer of
the: U. S.. S, North Carolina, ex-
pressing his appreciation to the
student body for the Bibles given
to his ship as a part of the Christjan
Gift Fund. !

Jadger,

The Davidson Student Body:

Through the courtesy of Rev.
Gilbert Darlington, Treasurer of

the American Bible Society, we

have now received a total of 350
copies of the King James transla-
tion of the ‘Bible, which were the
gift of the young men of Davidson
Coltege to the men of the U. S. S.
North Carolina.

Such evidence of Christian fel-
lowship on the part of civilian
friends is greatly appreciated by
service men; and, in the North
Carolina, we particularly appreci-
ate this generous and timely action
by the student body of Davidson

College.

There is no measuring the good
these Bibles may do, nor the com-
fort and encouragement they may
bring to our men in the months to
come.

With personal thanks, I am,

Sincerely yours,
