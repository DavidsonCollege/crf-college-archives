-Hash House Harriers

Old “Hound And Hare’
Game Gains Popularity

By ANDY BARRON

They trot forward in a small pack
of about ten runners calling out mean-
ingless sets of words like “on on” and
“on up.” They are dressed as mild-
mannered joggers except for the exces-
sive stains of mud on their clothes.
Every now and then one of them will
sound a bugle and the whole pack will
come together and move forward.
Ever witnessed this sight? Ever won-
dered who those people were?

Well, the answer is Davidson’s
youngest, craziest, and most disor-
ganized outdoor activity, the Hash
House Harriers and Harriettes. Estab-
lished February 5, 1983 by a handful
of novices led by one experienced
“hasher,”’
the club has attracted new members
this year. Now over 30 Davidson stu-
dents have participated in at least one
“hash.” .

“Hashing is more than a sport,”
commented Harbert. “Hashing more
like a philosophy, that is, you have to
be laid back and enjoy going crazy and
having a good time. Hashing isn’t
competitive, it’s just a release.”

The Hash House Harriers is actu-
ally an international organization with
a proud history. It was originated by
British colonials who had nothing else
to do, the activity acquired its name
from the Selangor Club Chambers, af-
fectionately called the “Hash House”
due to the quality of food served. After
World War II, the activity spread and
now boasts clubs across the world.

Hashing migrated from Malaysia
to Davidson in the form of Harbert,
who lived in Indonesia for 13 years and
has run over 250 hashes. Harbert intro-
duced sophomores Frank Roberts ‘and
Griff Elder to hashing last year and the
three have been prime movers. of the
Davidson club.

Hashes are based on the old
“hound and hare” game. They are gen-
erally three to five miles long and start
in front of Chambers. Before the hash
begins, two members, called hares,
must go out and set the course. The
course is marked by handfuls of flour
approximately every 30 yards. The ob-
ject is to follow the marks wherever
they may lead. Woods and creeks are
favored obstacles, but other obstruc-
tions have been known to come into
play.

.“P’ve run in everything from small
canyons in Malaysia to kudzu in North
Carolina,” said Harbert. “A great hash

sophomore John Harbert,

we ran here was when we crossed a big
creek on a wire bridge. The better the
hare, the better the hash.”

In addition to the obstacles of na-
ture, human ingenuity and deception
make a hash more like a safari than a
jog through the park. The infamous
false trail, the bane of the hasher, is
what turns three-mile trails into five-
mile trails. Yet it is this that makes
hashing what it is.

The way a hash works is something
like this: the group follows spots of
flour until it arrives at a checkpoint and
the trail goes in several directions. The
group must then fan out and determine
the correct trail. This is where the sys-
tem of calls comes in. “Checking”
means searching for the trail. “Onup”
means the trail is up ahead and “on on”
means the trail has been found. The
final call is the dreaded “‘falsie” or “on-
back” which means the group has fol-:

lowed the wrong trail and must now go —

back and find the right one.

False trails also make it unneces-
sary to be a good runner. The runners
in better condition tend to run faster
but do all the work finding trails. The
slower runners thus cover a shorter dis-
tance since they very rarely stray from
the correct path.

‘When the run is finished, the hash
is only 50 percent complete. The post
run fellowship is an equally important
part of hashing. It is here that new run-
ners are initiated. A “downdown’-
serves both of the functions. A “down
down” involves chugging a beer from
the club’s pewter cup to the following
song:

“Here’s to Andy, he’s true blue,

He’s a hasher through and through

He’s a pisspot, so they say,

Tried to go to heaven but he went the other
way.

Drink it down, down, down, . . .”

Some violations include running
silently, short cutting, training specif-
ically for hashing, and not having done
a downdown in a while.

“There are a few things that make a
good hash,” said Harbert. “One, the
group stays together. Two, lots of mud
and a little barbed wire. Third, and
most important, not t running out of
beer.”

Hashing, for all its hazards and
craziness, is virtually an injury-free
sport. This is due to. cautious running
and the loose attitude involved. Seri-
ous. runners are only allowed if they
can show a relaxed side and go. crazy
with those that never run.

Davidson sophomore Janice Evans
will represent the one-year-old Davidson
equestrian team in the Division I Na-
tional Championships this weekend in
Harrisburg, PA. Evans will compete in
the walk and trot categories.

“Going to nationals is both exciting
and unexpected,” Evans said. “Nationals
has been a distant thought since Sep-
tember, when we started. However, |
never expected to go. I’m really looking
forward to it.”

Evans qualified for the nationals
three weekends ago by winning first
place in the advanced walk-trot class at
the Region IX Intercollegiate Champion-
ship Horse Show held in Columbia, SC.

Nevertheless, freshman powerhouse
Greg Foreman performed impressively
in the 800-meter run. Setting a new |
a “Davidson record of 1:56.2, he edged the”
previous record of 1:56.8 set PY Frank.

Evans To Compete In
National Championships

The regular season, which stretched
from tryouts in September to the David-
son Classic in April, served as the qual-
ifying standard for regionals. Evans
earned enough points during the season
to qualify for the regionals.

“At team meetings all year long we
were constantly reminded that regionals
were coming up,” said Evans, “but I
never seriously thought I’d wind up at
Nationals. I’m excited about the caliber
of competition and I’m hoping to do
well.”

Evans has served as the equestrian
team secretary for the 1983-84 season
and has been riding under the direction of
coach Nancy Hoffman since the fall of
1983.

breaking the old record of 44.1 set in
1978.

Both the men’s and the women’s
teams will race tomorrow at the Johnson
