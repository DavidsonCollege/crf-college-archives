nature of The Davidsonian, we’ve
taken the liberty of selectively

wrong, Masculin, Feminin did

themes: politics and whoopiec.
Both are treated in
scenes that let us observe the lives
of these frustrated and impas-
sioned characters without the
added hindrance of making any
point whatsoever. The voyeur tac-
tics employed in this obviously
low-budget feature give us such
treats as numerous 10 to 15 minute
dialogue sequences with no
change in the unassuming camera
angle. Some people might call this
art; we call it dull.

While the film does ee
some interesting points about Fr-
ance and the 1960s change in so-
cial attitudes, its bizarre incom-
prehensible style makes it impos-
sible to enjoy. Outside of such
classic lines‘as “I like the way you

and discussed alternate behavior~
research therapist on the screen

every 10 minutes, and a woman in

one scene modeling a bra who
bears a striking resemblance to an
acquaintance of ours named
Doris, the film leaves little worth
recommending.

Those of you who thioowe to
attend, be it to practice your
French or merely your ability to
read subtitles, are in for the most
relaxing two hours of your
lives — unless you stay awake.
You have been warned.

Masculin, Feminin will be
shown in Love Auditorium on Fri-
day, October 2 and Saturday, Oc-
tober 3. Both showings are at 8
p.m.
