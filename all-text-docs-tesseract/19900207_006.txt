( In Good Health 2 2)
It's hard to know what to believe these days

By MARK D. PUCKETT

Just when the health people up in
Washington had us believing that
Oat Bran was the miracle cure for
everything from constipation to can-
cer, we find out recently that Oat
Branisno better for us than Rice Bran
or Potato Bran or even Lamb Bran for
that matter. In addition to this hoax,
I read in a famous magazine that
fluoridated water may cause cancer.
Our prostates and kidneys and ova-
ries may wither away, but at least we
won't have a lot of plaque build-up
or cavities WHEN THEREST OF US
DISINTEGRATES.

To top off this rotten rhubarb pie
with a piece of warm melted blue-
berry ice cream, it seems that the air
teems with other pernicious half-
truths and baneful fabrications and
noxious prevarications and outright

Ne

deleterious lies about the health world.
Take a gander at the following:

1. Smoking is bad for you. WRONG.
There have been a lot of smart scientists
recently who have been doing a lot of

research in the field of smoking who |
' because lip cancer’s not that bad any-

say, “Itis actually beneficial tocharbroil
your lungs and annoy other people
with choking fumes of death. And even
if smoking does cause cancer, it doesn’t
matter because cancer’s not that bad
anyway.”

These same scientists also confuted
the theory that people who smoke are
social cripples with oral fixations:
“These people aren’t social cripples
with oral fixations. Instead, they are
actually very confident people with
anal fixations.”

2. Dipping is bad for you. WRONG
AGAIN. The same scientists who did
research on smoking in the previous

paragraphs have brothers who are also
smart and who have researched a
bunch of stuff about dipping. Here’s
what they found out: “It: [dipping]
doesn’t cause lip cancer or rotten teeth.
And even if it doesn’t, it doesn’t matter

way. Besides, dippers don’t care what
they look like--they stuff half a can of
dip in their lower lip at one time and

look stupid; why should it bother them.

that they might look stupid when their
lips fall off and their teeth fall out?”

3. Exercise is good for you. FOOLED
YOU. It turns out that aerobic exercise
such as running, biking, jumping, sex,
and hunting is a big waste of time.

Said one fraternity member of Patter-
son Court, “Yeah, exercising bothers
me. I run and lift weights once a week
and I’m still a fat loser. I mean, I drink
some on Thursday, Friday and Satur-

day and a little on Wednesday and
Monday and maybe some on Tues-
day, but I hardly ever drink on Sun-
da

Sia also one member of the befit-
tingly named Patterson Court Fe-
male Eating Troughs--uhh, Houses:
“I don’t get it. 1 went jogging last
month and did aerobics once when I
was eleven, but I still gain weight. I
never go to meals because I have a
supply of good food in my room that
Mommy sends me--fudge, brownies,
potato chips, jelly doughnuts. -

Ican’t figure it out: why am I such
an insipid superflyous anti-pulchri-
tudinous pork-bellied minx?”

Yeah, I was surprised too.
I guess you have to keep an open
mind and expectanything i it this day
and age.
