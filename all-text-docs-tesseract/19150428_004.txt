own expressive words, he finds himself
“so unnecessary.

The play as a whole was much above
the average amateur production; and the
lack of adequate scenery and stage facili-
ties were more than made up by the ex-
cellent acting of the entire cast. There
was not a single weak part, and the
company as a whole deserve much credit
for the way in which each role was han-
died. In addition to those already
named, Misses Payne and Thomson
should be mentioned. together with
Messrs. Morrison. McKee. and Wil-
liamson. fos the creditable showing
which thev made.

G. Morrison; Tad Cheseldine. a college

Wake Forest Game.

On Saturday, April .24, the Red and
Black was defeated by Wake Forest, the
score being 6 to 2. The game was in-
teresting from the start to the finish, and
at one time it looked as if the locals
would be the victors, but the hoodoo ap-
peared in the seventh inning, when the

japtists made four runs.

Davidson scored first. Christenbury,
the first man up, singled and_ was sacri-
ficed to second. by Somerville, scoring
when Alford singled.

Wake Forest eased in a couple in their
half of the fourth. Carlyle, the first
man up, was hit by Lawson, was sacri-
ficed to second, and scored when Hold-
ing hit to right field fence for three
bases. Holding was able to count later
on an infield hit.

The Presbyterians, came back in their
half of the fourth and courited one more,
evening up the score. Austin hit to the
ence for a triple and scored on Saund-
ers’ bingle.

Then came the disastrous seventh.
Two men were down and Hensley was
on second. Moore hit the umpire with
a ground ball and was safe; an instant
after this a steal was attempted and Al-
ford pegged to Somerville; then Hensley
started home and was safe because Som-
erville held the ball until it was too late
to catch the runner at the plate. On an
error and two singles the visitors were
able to register three more runs.

The feature of the game was a catch
made by Groome in deep center field and
robbing Holding of another hit, which
seemed to be good for three bases.

Both Lawson and Moore pitched fine
ball. The former struck out seven and
walked only one. while the latter struck
out four and walked two.

The DAVIDSONIAN. April 28, 1915

SOPHS HOLD BIG “FEED.”

Last Frida night at 9 o'clock practi-
cally every Soph/on the Hill gathered
in the Commencement hall for a big in-
formal “feed.” It was successful ‘in
every way—the speeches were snapp
and full of wit, and it seemed as thoug
everybody came determined to throw off
all reserve and have a good time. Toast-
master McKay ran things in fine fashion
and kept up continual pep.

A feature of thé occasion was the but-
lers, Oskeegum and Maud, two mem-
bers of the local colored contingent who
are a familiar Sight on the campus, dress-
ed in white. They welcomed each guest
at the door with a “Lord Chesterheld”
bow and ushered him to his seat. en
the guests were each handed a souvenir
of the occasion. The tables were over-
loaded with all kinds of appetizing food.
Oskeegum and Maud served drinks and
ice cream. ,

After everyone had eaten and was
smoking his cigar. Toastmaster McKay
started the ball rolling with a few intro-
ductorv remarks, after which he called

T.Jon “Al” Reese, the president of the class,

who welcomed the guests and extended
thanks to Hampton, the manager,’ and
McKay. iv hehalf of the class for their
efforts. ‘Eddie’ Hampton next thank-
ed those who ‘had helped him in prepar-
ing the feed. “Long boy” Jolinson, the
Senior representative. in a verv happy
manner told. of his appreciation in being
able to attend. “Shorty Williams,” the
Tunior representative, next spoke, call-
ing attention to the association of the
classes in the past and the hopes for
better co-operation in the future. Next
came “Judas Iscariot” Black, the Fresh
representative, who heartily thanked the
class for their invitation and hospitality.
“Red” Nisbet in a clever speech spoke of
how much the absent ones were. missing,
and made several hits at the toastmaster.
Jack Paisley gave a good talk on the
spirit of 17. Next the toastmaster call-
ed on Reese Jenkins to address the crowd
in his native Charlestonian brogue. Sam
Keesler next gave a good speech on the
“Athletes of °17.° He compared the
Soph foot ball representatives on the
"Varsity to the American flag, for “when
‘Red’ Laird skirted the end with White
in the line, the opposing side began to
look blue.” “Bennie” Hagood then
spoke on the pleasing subject, “The
Ladies.” Next was “Billy” Sayad, from
far-away Persia, who gave one of the
most enjoyable talks of the night. He
spoke of how much at home the David-
son men and the Americans in general
made the foreigners feel when they come
over to this country for an education,
and helped them. He said that some
dav the Orient would develop into great
nations, and all credit would be due to
the United States. “Shine’’ Mcl.ead
gave an enjovable discourse on “Colones
Scofield.” “Mike” Anslev gave — the
prophecies in regard to various members
of the class, Andy” Brown spoke on
the “Faculty.” “Long” Faison “pulled”
an excellent ioke on the Ford. There
were manv other good short ‘specches.

After the two butlers had entertained
the crowd with clog dancing the class
vell was given and fifteen far “Eddie”
and “Butch” and straight wav proceed-
ed ta bed(?). Too much credit cannot
be given to “Eddie” Hampton for his
splendid management of the affair and to
McKav for the pleasing way in which
he handled the feed.

DR. LAFFERTY DELIVERS
FORCEFUL SERMONS

Rev. Mr. Lafferty addressed the con-
gregation here Sunday. Mr, Lafferty is
a forceful speaker, and not a few spoke
of benefit derived from his two sermons.

At the morning service he chose as his
text the distinctions between the narrow
and broad ways to eternal_life, showing
the difficulties and perplexities of the
Christian who would follow aright.

In the evening the sermon was taken
from the 15th chapter of St. John, the
relationship between the Father and His
children, through Jesus Christ, the Son.
The picture was most beautifully pre-
sented and one could not help but feel
deeply henefited by listening.
