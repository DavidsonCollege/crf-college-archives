The Davidson Wildcats of-
ficially began the post-Stephen
Curry era on Saturday, putting up
a mighty struggle before falling on
the road to No. 10 Butler 73-62.

The Wildcats balanced offen-
sive attack was led by post player
Ben Allison ’12 who poured in a
career-high 13 points and hauled in
seven rebounds, Point guard Bren-
dan McKillop ’11 added 11 points
on 3-6 shooting from beyond the
arc to go with five rebounds and
three assists. Steve Rossiter 10
and JP Kuhlman °13 each scored
nine (Kuhlman also had a game-
high six assists) and Jake Cohen
°13 produced eight points.

McKillop and Kuhlman drilled
three-pointers to cap a 10-2 run and
gave Davidson a 58-56 advantage
with nine minutes to play in the
game. The Wildcats proceeded
to go on a seven-minute scoring
drought, however, and by the time
Kuhlman canned a jumper with
two minutes to play, the Wildcats
were already down 68-60 and on
their way to defeat.

Playing in his first collegiate game, JP Kuhiman 43 added nine
points off the bench and led the team with six assists in the Wild-
cats’ 72-63 loss to #10 Butler on Saturday afternoon.

Davidson burst out of the gate
and took command early, using a
15-4 run to claim a 20-10 lead haif-
way through the first half. McKil-

lop ignited the spurt with consecu-
tive triples, and Will Archambault

Davidson. women’s _ basket-
ball opened their season on Friday
night in Lincoln, Nebraska against
the University of Nebraska Com-
huskers. Davidson fell 86-62 but
showed many positives against a
strong Nebraska squad.

Davidson continued its sea-
son against Creighton on Sunday
at the D.J. Sokol Arena in Omaha,
Nebraska, dropping their second
game of the season 77-58. Julie
Paquette ’10 would not let David-
son go down without a fight though
and registered a double-double.

On Friday night, Davidson
came out to play. The scoreboard
does not do the Wildcats justice as
four of the Davidson squad finished
in double figures.

Alex Thompson ’10 led all

nine shooting and Monica Laune

Nebraska shot 45.6 percent from

Davidson as eight of Nebraska’s

# 8 Gamecocks finally tame
’Cats in NCAA Tournament

JOHN MorGAN
Staff Writer

Even before last Friday’s game,
the dynamics of the season had
changed. After winning the SoCon
Tournament and advancing to the
program’s first NCAA Tournament,
it was all about fun — the icing on
the cake of a sweet season. And
though the team fell 4-0 to 2-seed
South Carolina, the legacy of this
team won’t be shutout anytime
soon.

The Gamecocks entered the
NCAA tournament as champions of
the SEC, one of the perennial pow-
erhouses in women’s soccer. The
Cats had just blown away every-
one with their first SoCon champi-
onship in 13 years, and for the pro-
gram, that win against Charleston
was worth the whole season.

But in the first half, Davidson
still came out on fire, showing they
could hang with the feisty Cocks
as equals. For the throng of Wild-
cat faithful in the stands, the open-
ing minutes offered plenty to shout
about.

Though the home team domi-
nated in shooting, 11 to 1, the ’Cats
owned a solid amount of posses-
sion, working the ball down for a
few offensive strikes. Two Allison
Drutchas ’1] comer kicks offered
the most thrilling chances for a
Davidson score, but the forwards
couldn’t find clear shots at the net.

After South Carolina snagged
its first goal of the game in the 30th
minute off an unstoppable shot
from outside the box, both David-
son fans and players braced for the
onslaught. But for the next 20 min-
utes, at least, it never came. Much
credit is due to keeper Jessie Baxa
”12, who posted a slew of six saves
in the half. As the first buzzer
sounded, the ’Cats held tight down
1-0.

Within a few fleeting minutes
of the second half, the Cocks’ com-
petitive edge came out in full force.
With the Davidson D halting their
advances at the box, they ripped
impressive shots from 30 yards out.
Between minutes 52 and 56, South
Carolina notched 3 goals to put the
game away.

Even in those trying moments,
the "Cats looked like they were
playing the game with passion.
Down a daunting tally of goals,
they maintained the tenacity and
intensity of the first 10 minutes
and gave the crowd a show for all
it was worth. In doing so, David-
son earned the program a load of
respect from one of the country’s
top teams.

At the closing whistle, the play-
ers had no reason to complain. It
was a hard-fought game, for sure,
but it merely capped off the hard-
est fought season of their careers.
