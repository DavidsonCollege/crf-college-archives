Construction began last week
at Davidson College on two new
‘apartment-style student residence
halls that will be ready for occu-
pancy next school year. the total
cost of both buildings is $2.3 mil-
lion, and an additional $180,000 is
budgeted for their furnishings. The
contractor is Rogers Builders of
Charlotte.

Richard Terry, director of resi-
dence life, said the buildings are
using floor plans virtually identi-
cal to three residence halls con-
structed in the same northeast area
of campus three years ago. The
area is now designated as D. Grier
Martin Court in honor of a former
Davidson President. However,
unlike the other buildings, the new
ones will each include two eleva-
tor shafts to meetnew handicapped
access codes.

The basic floor plan calls for

three-story buildings with two
apartments on each end for a total
of 12 apartments. Each apartment
will house four students. They
will have individual sleeping
rooms, butsharea bath-and-a-half,
a kitchen, living room and bal-
cony. One building, however, is

- being constructed on ahillside and

will include a basement allowing
for two additional apartments, as
well as a laundry, vending and
meeting space.

The residence halls, which are
unnamed at this point, were. ap-
proved by Davidson’s board of
Trustees at its February meeting to
relieve overcrowding of on-cam-
pus housing. Terry said that with
the new residence halls Davidson
will have 1,403 beds on campus
for its 1,500 students. Construc-
tion is expected to be finished by

Pew Award Assists Women and
Minorities in Science and Math

_ By Lisa Gerrard

Davidson College, Duke Uni-
versity, Furman University and five
Ohio schools will share a $1.3
million grant from the Pew Sci-
ence Program in Undergraduate
Education for aresearch and men-
toring program for femaleand black
students in science and math.

The Pew Science Program will
awarda total of $7.3 million to five
clusters of colleges and universi-
ties, with 49 schools involved na-
tionwide. The grants continue sup-
port of teaching and research to
recruit more science and math
scholars.

-The awards should help offset
enormous :shortages of scientists
andengineers expected by the year
2010. The Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics reports that faculty retirements
over the next 20 years will outstrip
the number of available new
Ph.D.’s, resulting in fewer schol-
ars at a time when more jobs than
ever will require scientific back-
ground and expertise.

“Those statistics are rather dis-
turbing,” said John. Williamson,
chairman of the Davidson College
biology department. “The United
Statesis not training enough people
to replace those who are moving
out. And 50 percent of those who

are being trained are not Ameri-

cans but foreign nationals who may

or may not stay in the country. We
should be training more. The thrust
of the Pew projectis to increase the
participation of under-represented
groups in science and math. The
interest is there, we just have to
cultivate it.”

Three years ago, the Pew Sci-
ence Program awarded grants to
eight clusters of schools, involv-
ing 72 private colleges and research
universities selected for their lead-
ing role in the education of scien-
tists and mathematicians.
Davidson was among them.

After careful monitoring, the

program chose the most promising :

projects forcontinued support. The
grants now awarded will fund these
efforts for another three years.
The strongest and most pro-
ductive projects cited by the Pew
Science program involve faculty
and curriculum development. The
Carolina/Ohio cluster program in-
cludes peer groups, mentoring by
successful female and black scien-
tists, career conferences, summer

_ réSearch and fieldwork. It begins

the freshman year and continues

through a first teaching appoint-

ment. ;
Williamson says several

Davidson College students in the
program will complete research
projects at Duke University this
summer, while students from other
schools will come to work with
Davidson professors.

“All of the funded projects
involve collaborative efforts be-
cause such efforts provide institu-
tions with capabilities that even
the best institutions could not at-
tain individually,” said John Gir-
gus, Pew Science Program direc-
tor and Princeton University psy-
chology professor.

“These Collaborative pro-
grams enable schools to take ad-
vantage of their complementary
projects,” said Thomas Langfitt,
president of Pew Charitable Trusts,
the organization that funds the
program.

The Pew Charitable Trusts,:a
national philanthropy based: in
Philadelphia, support nonprofit or-
ganizations dedicated to improv-
ing the quality of life for individu-
als and communities and encour-
aging personal growth and self-
sufficiency. Grants are awarded in
the areas of conservatioenviron-
ment, culture, education,health and
human services, public policy and
religion.
