Still Whistlin' Dixie: Geoff Graham

Country stars sing the
Eagles in Common CD

For those of us still blindly
hoping for an Eagles reunion, Don
Henley and his crew at the Walden
Woods Project have tossed out a
teasing morsel. Common Thread:
The Songs of the Eaglesjust hit the
record stores last week. Thirteen
leading country artists joined hands
to pay tribute to the greatest band
of the 1970s while helping to pre-
serve “environmentally sensitive
and historically significant forest-
land near Henry David Thoreau’s
famed retreat at Walden Pond.”

I know what a lot of you are
thinking. “Oh, great. A bunch of
yahoos out there butchering my
favorite tunes. That’s just what I
need,” I’ll be the first to admit a
few of these songs don’t quite hit
the mark, but for the most part they
are refreshing interpretations
tinged with just enough originality
to remain loyal to their progeni-
tors.

Before you scoff, keepin mind
that the Eagles are rumored to have
begun their careér, not with a lead
guitar, but with a lead banjo. They

‘ got their start, supposedly, as a
Bluegrass band. If you don’t be-
lieve me, slip in “Seven Bridges
Road” or “Take it Easy.” Can you
hear that rolling flatpicking and
the echo of a banjo in the back-
ground?

You’ll hear it again on Com-
mon Thread. You won’ t like it all,
but you’ll hear it again.

Travis Tritt opens the album
with his creative version of “Take
It Easy.” Surprisingly, Travis
sounds pretty good. However, the
tasteless arrangement lacks el-
egance. An insane guitar refuses
to stay quiet and ruins the song.
Little Texas, on the other hand,
does justice to my all time favorite
guitar solo on “Peaceful Easy Feel-
ing.” If Dwayne O’Brien had only
kept his mouth shut it would have
been a great tune.

I have only one thing to say
about “Heartache Tonight:” John
Anderson can’tsing. Tanya Tucker
makes the last mistake on the al-
bum with “Already Gone.” I had
hoped for something of the calibre
of “Two Sparrows in a Hurricane”

and ended up with another Delbert
McClinton duet.

With those out of the way, I’ll
move on. The rest of the album
would make Henry himself proud.
Clint Black doesn’t change a thing
for “Desperado,” and I’m not sure

I’ve ever heard him sing with more ~

heart. Alan Jackson, the greatest
voice in Country today, can do no
wrong. “Tequila Sunrise” was
originally a country song, but with
that voice and that steel guitar it
becomes pure Country. “Saturday
Night,” Billy Dean style, made my
heart melt. There’s nothing more
heart wrenching than lost love her-
alded with a crying fiddle.

The final six songs were pleas-
antsurprises. Vince Gill’s “ICan’t
Tell You Why” is one of the
album’s best. Brooks & Dunn sing
with startling ability on “Best Of
My Love.” The boys from Dia-
mond Rio, being the incredible
musicians they are, do wondrous
things with “Lying Eyes.” Some-
how, they manage toshow off with-
out making it obvious.

With the exception of Tanya
Tucker, the women on the album
are fantastic. Suzy Bogguss sings
“Take it to the Limit,” (she twists a
word or two to keep it from sound-
ing kinda funky) with her patented
enthusiasm, Trisha Yearwood
(who enlisted Don Henley’s aid
last summer for “Walkaway Joe”)
performs “New Kidin Town” faith-
fully and superbly.

Common Thread ends with
Lorrie Morgan singing “The Sad
Cafe.” I couldn’t help but think of
her late husband, Keith Whitley,
and his suicide. I couldn’t pick a
better Country artist, man or
woman, to sing this one.

We may rant and rave about
one genre being better than an-
other, but in the end, it’s all music.
Albums like Common Thread and
bands like the Eagles make that
point stronger than I ever could in
words. Country, Rock, Blues, ev-
erything—they all have their ties
to one another. I think that’s what
Don Henley tried to say with the
title. We all have our common
threads.

The Brentano String Quartet practices Thursday night before their Friday night performance in

which they premiered Milton Babbitt's String Quartet No. 6.

Babbitt "wows" Davidson audience

By Carrie Blackburn

Milton Babbitt, the world re-
nowned composer, offered a
Davidson audience a special treat
Friday night when the Brentano
String Quartet performed the world
debut of Babbitt's String Quartet
No. 6.

The piece represents Babbitt’s
12-tone system which he revolu-
tionized in America. Part of the
special nature of this technique
involves its technical aspect which
can best be explained arithmeti-
cally.

In an interview in the Novem-
ber 14th issue of Zhe Charlotte
Observer, Babbitt cautions, how-
ever, “that to assert that you could
begin with some mathematical tau-
tology and end up with music is
absurd.”

In his lecture in which he dis-
cussed “Music in Our Time,” Bab-
bitt emphasized how misrepre-
sented the 12-tone system contin-
ues to be. He cautioned that it does
not entail having to use each tone
once until one is repeated, but
within it “the ordering is constantly,
vividly present.”

Babbitt alluded to the musical
revolution which he witnessed first-
hand in New York when compos-
ers such as Schoenberg and Berg
escaped the Nazi wrath in Ger-

many. He said that the “materials
were always there; the organiza-
tion of music changed.”

Babbitt’s heavy involvement
with the schooling side of music
has influenced his opinion of pub-
lic education in music. He “wor-
ries about the disappearance of
formal conditioning in our
schools...[because] there is no dis-
cipline for music...in,most public
schools.”

To truly appreciate great mu-
sic, a listener must be discerning
enough torelate current pieces with
ones previously heard, Babbitt be-
lieves.

Another concern of Babbitt’s
involves the lack of performers
willing to play new music today.
Most performers simply want to
gain fame by re-creating older
music rather than risking new
styles.

Fortunately, through the help
of universities, musicians like the
Brentano String Quartet and Rob-
ert Taub are still willing to perform
Babbitt’s innovative style.

Taub, an old friend of
Babbitt’s, truly understands the
complexity of the 12-tone method
which was apparent in his dra-
matic performance.

Apress release sights Taub as
“an internationally acclaimed

leader in the new generation of
virtuoso pianists.”

A festival headlined by Milton
Babbitt, featuring the Brentano
String Quartet and Robert Taub is”
an impressive assemblage any-
where, but especially when it oc-
curs right in our own backyard.

The festival began Thursday
evening with a public lecture by
Babbitt entitled “A Composer of a
Certain Age” and continued on
Friday mornifig with another lec-
ture for music majors on “My Life
with Twelve Pitch Classes.” Also
on Friday, Babbitt and pianist Rob-
ert Taub participated in a lecture/
rehearsal in the afternoon and a
pre-concert roundtable with
Claudio Spies that evening.

Friday night featured the
Brentano String Quartet comprised
of Mark Steinberg and Serena
Canin (violins), Misha Amory
(viola), and Michael Kannen
(cello). The final event of the
weekend on Saturday evening wit-
nessed Robert Taub in concert as
part of the Artist Series. ES

Music professor Dr. Mauro
Botelho summed up the event:
"Getting this is a major coup for
Davidson."

(Note: Due to Babbitt’s press-
ing time schedule, he was unavail-
able for an interview.)

Don't spend the Remains of your day at this bombshell

This week, in search of cul-
ture I suppose, I ventured into the
theater to see The Remains of the
Day. This is the latest collabora-
tion from the same team that
brought us Howard’s End and A
Room Witha View--director James
Ivory working with his long time
colleagues Ismail Merchant (pro-
ducer) and Ruth Jabvala (writer).
Again they adapt from a novel
(this time by Kazuo Ishiguro and
not E.M. Forster) which serves to
reunite Howard’s End stars An-
thony Hopkins and Emma Thomp-
son.

Now, Isaw Howard’s End for

the first time a couple of weeks
ago, and I must say that I was less
than impressed with it. I was then
a little skeptical about seeing The
Remains of the Day because of my
disastrous experience with
Howard’s End, but having read
such good things about it, I de-
cided to give it a chance. Child, I
should have left giving stuff a
chance to John Lennon because
this was one lemon I could have
done without seeing. It also goes
to show what passes for “culture”
these days, but that’s a discussion
for another day.

Anyway, the story centers on

Mr. Stevens (Hopkins), the head
butler at Darlington Hall. Stevens
is dedicated to serving his master,
d Darlington, to the best of his
ability and then some.

elping him to run the estate
is Miss Kenton (Thompson), head
of housekeeping and his would-be
love interest. Their lives at
Darlington Hall are recounted in a
series of flashbacks as Stevens
drives to the English coast to visit
Miss Kenton, whom he has not
seen intwenty years. Intermingled
with the tale of their thwarted ro-
mance as a backdrop is the story of
Lord Darlington, a Nazi sympa-

thizer whose political involvement
attracts great diplomats to
Darlington Hall.

As for the actors in this film,
they really did a great job. Both
Hopkins and Thompson were con-
vincing in their roles and to watch
theromantic tension between them
in their scenes together was magi-
cal. Unfortunately forboth ofthem,
they were ina story that went abso-
lutely nowhere. For the five min-
utes of intense passion and great
acting, there was an extremely dull
two and a half hours of so-called
political intrigue and preparing for
dinner parties. In addition to this,

the story is told so inconsistently
that I did not know if I was watch-
ing a love story or receiving a
history lesson.

If you’re brave enough to ac-
tually see this one, remember to
bring your pillow because I guar-
antee youll be asleep after the first
hour. The final word: The Re-
mains of the Day should have
remained a novel.

This movie has been rated PG by
the Motion Picture Association

of America. Although it contains

no nudity or violence, the subject
matter is for mature audiences. |
