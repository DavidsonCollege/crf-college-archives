DAVIDSON WINS FROM
BAPTISTS.

catcher. McKirinon started out to
catch, that being the first time he had
received Bill Osteen’s benders. Bill
had so much stuff that afternoon that
McKinnon, never having caught him
before. was handicapped.

Davidson scored one in the first, also
another in the second. In the fourth
a flue must have blown out of the “ma-
chine’ —Wake Forest got three men on
and two of these scored on pass balls by
the catcher. Two others scored on
bunts, which should easily have been
fielded, and Cuthrell drove the fifth run
in on a three-baeger to the right garden.
In the fifth Wake Forest scored one
more. In Davidson's half of the eighth
it looked for a while as if the lead would
be overcome when two men were reg-
istered, and there were more in sight,
but one: of the Baptists broke up a hit.
In the ninth Trust, of the Baptists, hit
one to center field for four bases which
Stough could easily have pulled down
had not the wind carried it about three
feet over his head. For Davidson
Christy started the last of the ninth off
with a three-baeger, and the chances of
still winning the game looked — very
prosperous. Kluttz, next up, hit one
over the right fielder’s head, . Christy
scored, and the umpire called Kluttz
out on a close decision at third. The
next two un popped out.

The final score was 7 to 3 in favor of
Wake Forest. Osteen pitched a good
game, and if the, infield had not had an
“off dav” in just one inning the victory
would have been .different. However,
such an inning w ill happen to the best
of teams. for even the “Giants” and
“Athletics” have them sometimes. The
result is not blamed on the umpire, but
several times he “stung” the “Red and
Blacks,” and very much off on_ balls
and strikes.

The feature of the game ‘for Wake
Forest was the stabbing of a hit of |w
Christenburv's by Trust in center field
which was good for three sacks. String-
field at third plaved a good game.

Special mention should be made of the

Messrs. Tohnston and McGregor. which

was consistent throughout, and of Mor-
rison, who was at his best in the Ex-
amination scene.

No opportunity was overlooked to in-
troduce well directed local hits. which
were received by the audience with keen
appreciation.

Sumimarizing in one_ brief sentence, it
can well be said that in recent years at
least, this is by far the best play of its
tind that has ever been presented to a
Davidson audience.
