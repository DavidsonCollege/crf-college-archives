Pretty Woman Is Pretty Mindless

I guess it was inevitable. After
the massive success at the box
office, it had to happen. I was
hoping it would just flutter away
into the darker reaches of the
American memory, never to dis-
turb again, but, no. Sadly enough
Pretty Woman has been released
on videocassette.

Now, once again, we must be
bombarded by a barrage of belit-
tling advertisements, celebrating
this fantastic love story, this Cin-
derella romance, this filthy load of
senseless and sexist drivel. (Why,
yes, as a matter of fact, I did have
a litle trouble finding an idea for
this week’s installment.)

Anyway, I knew the very first
time I saw an ad for this little flick
that I would hate it. Anytimea film
is billed as the “feel good movie of
the year” I do my best to avoid it.

Unfortunately, my best wasn’t
good enough in thiscase. While in
Cambridge last summer, a certain,
and still unforgiven, Ms. Caroline
Buxton, ‘90, talked me into escort-
ing her to see this abomination
because she didn’t wantto be alone
at the theater. Inexplicably, no-
body else felt like going.

After an utterly unsuccessful
attempt to talk the night manager
of the movie theater into refunding
my money and throwing ina little
extra for the suffering endured, I
vowed to use any means at my
disposal to promote the boycott of
this crap. Pretty Woman is noth-
ing less than an Communist plot to
support the subjugation of Ameri-
can women and keep Jesse Helms
in office. (So I’m a wee tiny bit
paranoid, sue me.)

The Macintosh Classic

With Apple's introduction of three new
Macintosh* computers, meeting the challenges of college
life just got a whole lot easier. Because now, everybody

can afford a Macintosh.

affordable model, yet it comes with everything you need—
including a hard disk drive. The EXQGGSH
combines color capabilities with affordability. And the
Miss is perfect for students who need a
computer with extra power and expandability.

No matter which Macintosh you choose, you'll
have a computer that lightens your work load without

giving you another tough subject to leam. Every Macintosh
computer is easy to set up and even easier to master. And
when you've learned one program, you're well on your
way to learning them all. That’s because thousands of avail-
able programs all work in the same, consistent manner.
You can even share information with someone who uses a
different type of computer—thanks to Apple's versatile
SuperDrive™ which reads from and writes to Macintosh,
MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple® II floppy disks.

of rectal residue makes my skin
absolutely crawl. The worst of itis
that Pretty Woman is actually a
popular film with women. I have
to ask myself how much sexism is
just tolerable and how much is
nothing less than a selling point.

Remember Fatal Attraction?
Have Glenn Close boil a bunny or
two and the film is labelled as
supportive of female stereotypes.
If Julia Roberts, however, is por-
trayed as a gold digging slut to be
saved from the streets by Prince
Charming, you get the most popu-
larand financially successful waste
of time in recent history.

Does this mean that if women
are exploited heinously enough
they’ll bag all their equal rights
businessand lay themselves outon
a piano for the first rich white man
to have at his whim? I would hope

not.

Inall seriousness, Pretty Woman
is a disgrace to any thinking per-
son. Please don’t waste your
money renting or buying this in-
sult. I have been told not to take
such drivel so seriously, that the
movie is just harmless fantasy.
Well, if this is fantasy, then the
fantasy evokes contempt. Preity
Woman is just a stupid script with
pathetic jokes, large breasts and
cheap innuendo; but its over-
whelming popularity is an indict-
ment of our rapidly crumbling
culture.
