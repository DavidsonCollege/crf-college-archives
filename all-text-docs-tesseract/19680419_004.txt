FAR FROM GOOD

Non-Academic Job Picture Improving

By NORWOOD POLAND
Staff Writer

Wages and working conditions of
Davidson College’s 90 non-academic
employees are improving, but the 1965
self study report stated ‘conditions
are far from good for this group of
(non-academic) employees at Davidson
College.”

Most non-academic employees do
not earn up to the $1.60 per
hour Federal minimum in industry.
This rate will not be required of the
College until 1971.

Following the College policy of
keeping wages competitive with those
in area industry. hourly rates for
janitors and maintenace workers have
risen above the $1.15 minimum set by
law. In addition, the work week has
been shortened from 45 hours three
vears ago to 40 hours in the past year.
two years ahead of the standard
schedule.

Robert A. Currie, college business
manager, said the faculty-administra-

tion self-study committee made an in-
tensive investigation of the College’s
employment policy and pay structure.
This group called for shortening the
work week. increasing wages to at
least the federal minimums, and pay-
ing a 50 percent overtime premium.
“These recommendaitons were car-
ried out before the College came under
the federal labor requirements, and
we have continued to stay ahead. The
50 percent overtime premium, for
example, will not be mandatory until
February, 1969,” Currie said.

However, assistant history professor
N. M. Johnson said that he
believed that the College “pays as
little as it can,” but he added that
federal Jaws and increased competition
in the area have helped the employ-
ment picture at Davidson.

“There are more alternatives for
employment in Davidson now” he

said.
“Increased fringe benefits and liber-

alized vacation privileges do add con-

siderably to the employees’ remuner-
ation,” said Robert Stephenson, as-
sistant business manager. “The Col-
lege contributes to hospitalization and
retirement insurance, and employees
are kept on the payroll year round.”

“We are proud of the progress be-
ing made in this area,” Stephenson
said. “We have come a long way in the
past few years, and we hope to con-
tinue to move ahead.”

The pay scale for non-academic
employees at Davidson is not unlike
that at Duke University until recently.
Students at that institution have been
actively supporting striking workers
through massive sit-ins and boycotts
which have received nationwide pub-
licity in the past week. Students and
labor union leaders there joined in
demanding a minimum hourly wage
of $1.60 for all employees and Univer-
sity recognition of the union.

The current minimum wage for
janitors and maintenance workers at
Duke is the required $1.15. Cafeteria

employees there receive a base pay
of $1.25 an hour, ten cents above the
government-set minimum.

At Davidson, all 19 cafeteria em-
ployees are hired and paid according
to a rate schedule dictated by the
caterer, Slater Food Service. Klaus
Kleeburg, Union Cafeteria Manager,
said the minimum wage paid is $1.15,
as required throughout the restaurant
industry. “I can’t disclose specific
rates, but pay varies upward from the
minimum, depending on job classifica-
tion and seniority,” Kleeburg said.

Cafeteria workers are employed all
year, and they also receive uniforms,
standard paid vacations, and voluntary
medical insurance.

The 38 students employed in the
Union Cafeteria under the work-study
plan, however, are paid $1.40 per
hour. This program is subsidized by
the federal government.

There are no labor unions either in
the cafeteria or among College em-
ployees.

The Residence Hall Coun

On Lingle Manor

The question as to what

ing to College Union Board .

President Ed Embree. Em-
bree said that although the
faculty committee on the
College Union, Fraternities.
and Clubs recommended that
the College Union get con-
trol of the Lingle Manor
building, the final decision
‘rests with the college treas-
urer, Robert Currie.

Several groups have re-
recently claimed control of
Lingle Manor, which is on
the site of the projected col-
lege library. When the group
that used the building dis-
banded last fall, they gave
contro! of the structure to
the student council who in
turn passed it on to the
Freshman Council. The orig-
inal group, however, did not
have the authority to desig-
nate control, and the College
Union expressed a desire to
use the building.

The concert will be 8-10

Room or on the patio of the
College Union.

“David, della Rosa, and
Brooks’ are a_ versatile
group, with a musical pres-
entation ranging from stand-
ard songs and current hits to
traditional folk ballads.

The group performed here
last year at one of the mid-
night concerts of Homecom
ing and also appeared at the
Block Booking Conference in
Charlotte last February.

Charlie ‘Cameron, chair.
man of the Social Council.
said that the Saturday per-
formance will be ‘‘more or
less an informal concert”

other activities planned for
the week-end.

Currie might decide to
turn the building over to

Freshman Council but use it

dean of students and the di-
rector of student housing. At
the Wednesday meeting of
the Student Life Committee,
Hobbie presented the idea to
sample their reaction.

According to Hobbie. there
was no objection made and
no action was taken since
approval is required from
only Mrs. Peter Nichols, di-
rector of student housing.
and Dean of Students Rich-
ard Burts.

Meeting. last Monday, the
council began a study of the
parts of the Residence Hall
Association Constitution and
the CRAP report that deal
with open dorms. Their plan
is to hold one or more open
houses to evaluate the pro-
posals in the constitution and
the CRAP report.

Screaming Color

A REVIEW
By DON HOYT

FeRini‘'s ‘Juliet of the
“Spirits” is color: color
screams in Suzy's Pleasure
Palace, the house of deprav
ity next door, and murmurs
in Jutiet’s secluded sea-side
villa, white . washed, green-
shuttered and candle-lit.

It is not the color found in
“Dr. Zhivago."’ Fellini dees
not reproduce nature: rath-
er. he creates a nature of his
own, and he is so deliberate,
imaginative. and consistent
within his own world that he
gets away with it.

“Juliet” has little plot,
much as Fellini believes life
has little plot; it deals with
the emotions, desires and
frustrations of a middle-aged
woman, Caught up in the re-
alization that the world is
leaving ker behind.

She is of one world; those
around her are of another.
They live in a world that is

perverted—sexually, intellec-
tually and spiritually. Theirs
is the world of “The Gradu-
ate’s Mrs. Robinson: Juli.
et’s is that of Elaine.

Fellini desires that we re-
treat from the Gothic horror
of Suzy’s Palace to the tran-
quil beauty of the pristine
forest. For two hours he

takes the audience on this
fantastical odyssey back to
the halcyon days of circuses
and biplanes, joy and love.
Fellini pictures a world that
is lost, but still regainable.

pointed to study the rules
which should apply to open
dorms. According to Hobbie,
their aim is to provide rules
the students will enforce so
as to prevent outside regula
tion of the open dorms.

A second committee of
Jim Hinshaw, Tom Opie. and
Steve Page was chosen to
evolve a method to pick
which dorms will participate
in the first open dorm ex-
periment. Hobbie said he ex-
pects the dorm or dorms for
the first open house to be
chosen next week.

Frank Bass, James Bryce
and Ray Stringfield compose
a third committee which. will
select the date fur the open
dorm session. They are try-
ing to place it sometime in
May.

Hobbie said that he has
great confidence these open
dorm sessions wil! succeed.
He stressed, however, that
these are actually trials to
evaluate rules and student
body participation.

The new: Activities Grant

grants so far, according to
Union President Ed Em.-
bree.

According to Embree, sev-
eral grants have already
been awarded to students
who will bring people to Da-
vidson who are authorities
in the fields in which these
students are interested.

“We've made one grant to
Buddy Newsom to bring in a

are going to bring down Jim
Bradley, a graduate student
in economics at UNC.CH,
and Mr. Peyton Woodson,
the president of Occidental

Embree said that these
men will discuss how a busi-
ness man can make a con-
tribution to society.

Embree stressed that ap-
plications for the grants must
include a well-organized pro-
gram and a proposed budget.

Rescue Squad Practice:
Scaling Cannon Dorm

and members of the rescue
squad were lowered from
the third floor of Cannon
dormitory by means of a
safety belt and by a rope
sling.

The rescue squad is able
to handle any foreseeable
accidents which may occur
on campus. according to Os
car Gant, head of the squad.
Gant said that the squad.
which was not formed until
three years ago, is solely for
college use, although the col-
lege will let other organiza-
tions use the squad's equip-
ment if necessary.

Gant explained that the
squad consists of eight men
who work on the college
campus. The members of the
squad have undergone 32
hours of training in addition
to a recent review course.

Gant feels that the squad
is capable of handling all
emergencies and added that
bi-weekly practices will be
held regularly in the future.

The practice drills attract
considerable student atten-
tion as curiosity seekers
gather to see hom or what
is being lowered out of the
upper stories of Cannon.
