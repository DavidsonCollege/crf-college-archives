Presidential Contenders Discuss Views

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

The seven candidates running
for the Presidency of the SGA
expressed this week their
opinions of Davidson's
problems and what could be
done about them.

John Branigan said he is run-
ning ‘‘just because I care about
Davidson. I don't care about
having this office on my record
because I don’t have any plans
for graduate school."

He observed that ‘‘too many
people are concerned about
their reputation with the Ad-
ministration. I don't feel loyalty
to anyone in the Ad-
ministration.

‘We've got to let them know
how far they can go and stop let-
ting them ramrod policies
through the SGA.” Branigan
said.

“Davidson is becoming im-
personal losing sight of the
quality that gave it its reputa-
tion,” he continued. “We've got
to make sure the student body 1s
informed about what's going
on.

Doug Brown, who has served
on the Senate, the Senate
Executive Committee, the
Educational Policy Committee,
and as Managing Editor of the
THE DAVIDSONIAN, sees one
of the problems of the Senate as
“not working in conjunction
with other student

organizations and through
faculty committees.”

To improve coordination,
Brown proposes a Campus
Council composed of such
organizations as the SGA. the
Patterson Court Council. and
the Union Board

“After working on THE
DAVIDSONIAN I think Ive
seen how to and how not to bring
about change.” he
Student government has con
tracted: my whole idea is to
widen it. to make ot more
representative and more tum
tional.”

John MeCartney said. “I'm

the resources to make Davidson
one of the finest liberal arts
colleges. but the Administration
is moving away from. this
goal.”

McCartney is in favor of
“disbanding the SGA Senate.
Instead, we need a College
Governance Council composed
of faculty, Administration and
students.

“The Administration has lost
the idea of service to the studen-
ts. The student body and faculty
are rarely consulted on
questions when they should be."’

He sees the SGA as ‘‘taking a
militant role, organizing protest
activities. I'll encourage
senators to talk more to their
constituents."’

lite should be directed away
from the Administration to the
Residence Hall Council and the
Patterson Court Council, Me-
Cartney said.

Steve Morris qualifies him-
self as a candidate by being “‘in
ciose touch with students. I
haven't spent too much time on
grades, but have concentrated
on enjoying myself at Davidson,
gearing away from organized
activities.”

Concerning the Senate, he
said, “An organization can
become sterile, until someone
comes in with a new, un-
structured plan, or at least a
willingness to listen to what's
going on, to get a little life into
it.”

Morris said he has ‘‘no
relations with people in the Ad-
ministration I need to protect,
so I don't feel any need to cater

to their influence."
Davidson students as a whole
don't see anything exciting

going on, Morris contends,
“but senators have the respon-
sibility of letting people know
what's happening.

“‘What I'd like to see is a more
open Davidson where people
start talking about problems
and what needs to be done,’’ he
concluded.

Bo Phillips said, ‘‘The main
point I'm running on is that, of
all the candidates, I've had the
most experience in the Senate,
so I think I can best get the job
done.

“It's a matter of who has the
best perspective as to what
direction the school can move in

the next five years,” he said.

“Not all the work in the
Senate is fun,’ Phillips noted.
“Some is exciting, some of it's
petty, but I've enjoyed it, as a
whole.”

“There's nothing too exciting
coming up, but what's im-
portant is to keep up the
momentum” in such areas as
coeducation, governance and
new dormitories.

He also proposes student
representation on the Budget,
Building and Grounds Com-
mittee and a comprehensive
study of subsidized athletics.

Sam Upchurch views his can-
didacy as ‘‘an attempt,
someone stepping out of the
apathy of Davidson.”

‘Student government needs a
change in policy concerning the
relationships of students,
faculty and Administration,"’ he
said. ‘‘I didn’t see any change in
the other people who were run-
ning.”’

As he sees it, ‘‘Pettiness has
been controlling the Senate.
Some of this is necessary, but it
shouldn't be the main issue.

“There ought to be a state of
mind in the Senate of almost at-
tacking the Administration -
not at every point -- but students
need and deserve to have more
power than they have now.”

“To make things move,
Students have to get behind the
Senate, and the Senate’s got to
take stands and force issues,”
Upchurch said.

All candidates for the SGA
Presidency will speak in an
Open End this Sunday at 8 p.m.

Connette Assumes

YMCA Presidency

By Bruce Maloy
Asst. Managing Editor

Junior Woody Connette has
been elected without opposition
as the president of the YMCA.

Connette said the immediate
plans for the Y are to finish up
the renovation of the old depot
and to get a study group
organized to utilize the depot to
its fullest extend.

“It was supposed to be
finished by Christmas,"’ said
Connette, ‘‘but we haven't been
able to come through with the
student workers which we
promised would help the work-
men with some of the labor.”

“What we need now,” Con-
nette continued, ‘‘is more
student input for ideas for new
programs. I'd like to see the
YMCA gear more of its
programs to the kids and the
older people in the com-
munity.”

‘Wilson Gunn came up with the
‘Adopt-A-Grandmother’ _ pro-
Bram. The idea is for students

togotalkto people whoare shut-
in and take them to the grocery
store or wherever they need to
go,”’ said Connette.

Connette encouraged studen-
ts who are interested in working
on the depot or who have ideas
for new programs to come by to
see him.
