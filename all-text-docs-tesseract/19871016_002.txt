Pena joins Spanish department

By AMY GOODE

Dr. L. H. Pena brings a
touch of Mexican pizazz to the
Davidson campus this year. A
“freshman” faculty member,
Dr. Pena hails from Monterrey,
Mexico. There he attended the
University of Monterrey for
four years and also the National
University of Mexico for one

year. Dr. Pena earned his PhD °

in contemporary Latin Ameri-
can novels at Arizona State Uni-
versity in Tempe, Arizona.

While he was at ASU he was a
research assistant in the Center
of Latin American Studies. His
other credentials include Chair-
man of the Spanish Department
at the University of Monterrey
and two year stints at Agnes
Scott College and the Univer-
sity of Minnesota-Minneapolis.

Dr. Pena teaches Spanish 20
and 100 and will lead a seminar
on Mexico in the Spring. He
will also be taking a group of

students over spring break to
Guadalajara. —

When asked what he enjoys
most about his new home, Dr.
Pena was quick to answer, “the
students.” He claims we have
taught him about our culture
and society through intelligent
dialogues. When not drilling
the essentials of the Spanish
novel, Dr. Pena enjoys walking
and the the occasional class of
tae kwan do.

arts colleges. Rigby pointed out
that with the VAX it is “easier for
the professors to share data, and it
is more powerful and faster than
the PRIME.”

The. VAX will also support
many more users than the PRIME.
Savarese joked that “many more

[users] can be doing a project at
the same time without bringing
the computer to its knees.”
Savarese also said that the
VAX offers students an important
practical advantage for their post-
college days, noting that “one is
more likely to find a VAX system

than a PRIME system in the real :

world.”

Our 75th Year

Savarese is clearly pleased’

with new computer and is en-
thusiastic about the potential it of-
fers. “For a college our size,” he
said, “the DEC VAX is a great
system to have. We don’t need an
enormous mainframe computer
like a large university would. The
enormous availability that the
VAX offers is exciting.”

‘Greene speaks

By MARGARET CARROLL
On Wednesday the Dean Rusk
Program in International Studies
hosted Tom Greene from the State
Department Office Concerning
Refugees, who spoke to an inter-
ested group of Davidson students
about Afghanistan’s present situa-
tion and its future prospects.
After his talk on Afghanistan,
students raised questions regard-
ing the Soviet Union’s role in
educating Afghan youth, India’s
position in the Afghan situation,

‘and Pakistan’s internal problems

as a result of hosting Afghan re-
fugees. :

Essential to understanding Af-
ghanistan’s present situation,, Mr.
Greene explained, is a knowledge
of the tribalism that exists in Af-
ghanistan. With the.aid of a map,
Mr. Greene showed the diverse’
and numerous groups that share
tribal loyalties and are bonded
through their own languages, reli-
gion, and cultures. Afghanistanis

- display their loyalties to their tribe

first and to their country second.
Mr. Greene has been in for-
eign service for many years in
Iran, India, Pakistan, and Af-
ghanistan and explained that the
Afghan conflict is also linked with
the balance of powers in the mid-
dle east and Afghanistan’s history
as a buffer state. From 1929-1978

(Behind Frame Gallery)

the Mohammedzai family ruled
Afghanistan, which was stable,
during that time and which also re-.
mained neutral in World War II
and acted as a buffer state in the
cold war.

In April of 1979, the leaders of
the Afghannational Communist
Party led a coup and established
themselves as rulers. In December
1979, the Soviets entered, claim-
ing to “preserve the gains of the
revolution.”” Upon Soviet en-
trance, many Afghan refugees
fled to Iran and Pakistan.

Today the Soviets have be-
tween 100,000 and 200,000
troops in Afghanistan, and there
are about’ 5 million refugees,
many’ stationed ‘in camps along
Afghan borders hoping, in the
UN’s words “someday to be able
to return to their homeland in free-
dom and dignity.” However Af-
ghans are continuing to bomb
Pakistan, trying to irritate the
Pakistani government and thus
force them to be less willing to
house refugees. ;

Mr. Greene feels that Af-
ghanistan’s future must be viewed

_ with “cautious optimism.” The

United States supports Pakistan
multi-laterally and searches for a
diplomatic solution to the Afghan
conflict. Some important de-
velopments have occurred fe-
cently that hint at lessened politi-
cal tension within Afghanistan.
For example, a coalition of the
seven political parties has been
formed and recognized by the
communist party (the PDPA).

‘ Also the government: declared a

cease-fire earlier this year, estab- ,
lished 4 new constitution, and has
given government positions to op-
position parties. -

The next few months, with the .
upcoming summit and UN meet-
ing, will be important in determin-
ing Afghanistan’s future. How-
ever, the pressing question is:
what will the Soviets be willing to
settle for in Afghanistan? Gor-
bachev claims that he will accept
Afghan neutrality if the Afghan
people make the choice, but the
Soviets have also talked about set-
ting up an interim government in

-Afghanistan.-If the UN continues

to receive support for its call for
neutralization and withdrawal of
arms, however, hopefully tension
will force the afghans to stop the
war and the refugees will be able
to return.
