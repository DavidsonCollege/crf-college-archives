Of the 30 colleges in the South that are
on the approved list it will be observed
that five are located in Virginia, four in
Missouri, three each in North Carolina
and Tennessee, two each in Maryland,
Washington City, Georgia, and Kentucky,
and one in each of seven states. There
is no institution of any kind on the ap-
proved list in the states of Deleware,
South Carolina, and Mississippi.

There are other institutions in the
South that are doing excellent work and
making steady progress year by year,
and we have little doubt but that three
or four others may properly claim ad-
mission to the approved list in the next
year or two.

Davidson College students formerly
had to walk to Mount Mourne for their
mail. At that time the receiver paid the
postage, the charge for a letter being
25 cents.

Until 1841 the students of Davidson
College not only had to keep their rooms
in order and cut their own wood, but
they Avere compelled to work cither
on the college farm or at some trade for
a certain period of time cach day.

Morrison Hall, now occupied by the
Biology and R. O. T. C. departments was
the first building to be erected on the
campus of a southern college for the
use of the Y. M.-C. A. The first floor
of the’ building, which is now used as
the armory was a gymnasium. There
was also a reading room and a parlor,
which were furnished by Mrs. Shearer.

3aseball was once forbidden at David-
son on the ground that it “involved a de-

In 1900-01, the first year Davidson had’
an outside coach seven out of eight foot-
ball games were won, among them being
a 36-6 victory over Georgia Tech.

The original colors of Davidson were
pink and blue until 1885 when the present
colors; red and black were adopted.

The Eumenean Literary Society, when
it was first organized, in 1837, was called
the Polemic Debating Society. The fol-
lowing year its name was changed. The
movement for society buildings was
started in 1842 by a member of the
Eumenean Society, but it was several
years before the consent of the faculty
could be obtained to take this step.’

Our night watchmen are not the first
our college has had. From 1845 to 1856

dent doing this work was paid fifty
cents for each night he worked.

The brick which were used in building
the original Chambers Building were
made of clay on the college land, the
stone used came from a quarry near
Concord.
