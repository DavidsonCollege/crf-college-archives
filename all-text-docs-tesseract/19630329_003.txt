A FEW SUGGESTIONS

_ Since this will be.my last column, I feel that I have
a right to drop the editorial “we” for a change and re-
sume my identity. First of all 1 would like to thank all
the boys who have written for me during the past year. |
They’ve caused a lot of headaches, but they’ve done a.
good job.

There are several observations that I would like to
make on the athletic program here at Davidson. These
observations have been made during the past year in my

contact with the sports program here. These are entirely -

personal opinions and should be regarded as such.

First, there should be an increase in scholarships, '
mainly to give such sports as tennis, track, wrestling, and ;
swimming one or two scholarships. This is not because
I believe in athletic scholarships in principle, but simply |

because we are in a conference where we have to com-;.

= schools who grant a few scholarships in most
sports.

score was Davidson 84, Lenoir
Rhyne 62, and Catawba 30.

Bill Rhyne of Lenoir Rhyne
was the meet’s highpoint man.
Although winning no events, he
placed in six—the 100, 220,
broad jump, high jump, pole
valut, and a leg on the winning
mile relay team—to rack up
15% points. Captain Bob Cordle
was Davidson's high-point man
with 11 points—placing first in
the broad jump, triple jump,
and fourth in the 100.

Alan Turner, Davidson's top
sprinter, won the 100, 220, and
ran anchor leg on the second-
place mile relay team. He finish-
ed with 10% points.

This is not to say that all, or even most, conference; ~~

schools subsidize these spot
disadvantage to most other schools in that we have rela-
tively fewer people to draw our teams. Compare the size
of our student body to that of The Citadel or VPI.

An added advantage in giving a few scholarships in
minor sports is that it takes much less to see the results.

Also, I would like to see an extra basketball scholar-|'
mar each year to give Coach Driesell a little more to work} °
with. i

I wish that the athletic department would take bet-

ter care of the cinder track and the tennis courts. I know
that the tennis courts are difficult to take care of proper- |

ly, but since the school chose to build that t court
they should also take the responsibility of taking good
care of them.

Another change I would really like to see made is
the opening of the gym at night several nights a week
— the basketball season for those who don’t get
enough opportunities to play in the afternoon.

Perhaps the thing that I would like to see most is the
building of a brand new gym that would be completely
adequate for our needs. Since this will not be forthcoming
any time in the near future, I would definitely like to see
an enlargement of the present gym to seat larger crowds.

In closing I would like to say that it’s been hectic,
at times and always time consuming but I've really en-
joyed my year as sports editor. The people I’ve gotten to
know and work with in the athletic department are really

a good group.
RANDOM THOUGHTS

Lefty Driesell was sporting a brand new flashy watch
and assistant coach Joe Hunt was eating over a fancy
piece of new luggage Tuesday morning after they were
wined and dined at an alumni affair Monday night.
Another alumni to-do is in the cards with Lefty once
more guest of honor. Word was on Monday's fling that
more old grads were on hand than at any other time for
any kind of event . . . so it just goes to show how im-
portant the old grads think sports are at the alma mater.

Joe and Lefty are busy recruiting now. Hoping to

but Davidson is at an added |

line up some more talent for:next s team. ue

Ronnie Ritter Signs
Basketball Scholarship

Basketball coach Lefty Drie-
sell has announced the signing
of Ronnie Ritter, high school
basketballer from Cranford, N.
J., to a grant-in-aid athletic
scholarship at Davidson College.

Ritter, 6'3" and a 20 point per

game high school star at Cran-
ford High School, is the first
basketballer signed in by the
Wildcats this spring for their
basketball program.

“Ritter is a great outside
shooter and floorman. We con-
sider him to be a very fine pros-
pect for college basketball,”
said assistant basketball coach
Joe Hunt.

The 'Cat linksters received
setbacks on Monday and Tues-

Dole Says Spring F ootball
Is ‘Very Good’ This Year

BY ROGER DAVID

Sports Steff Writer
Today marks the 13th session of spring practice for

the Wildcat football team, a
it to be ‘very good.”

The greatest problem facing
the team now is the conflict of
labs. Every day there are at
least eight boys who cannot

|make practice because of lab.

This necessitates reviewing
much each day for the boys who
missed the day before, and con-
centrating on the individual
player. Because of these con-
flicts, there will be no spring
scrimmage this year.

Up to this time Dole has been
spending a great deal of time

-|working on the offense and

kicking game. After spring vaca-
tion there will be only eight
more days of practice for the
Wildcats to polish up their
game.

Dole seems to be especially
pleased with the development
of some key rising sophomores.

nd Coach Bill Dole considers |

Sid. Thompkins, a quarterback, |
was described as “well-skilled |
and fast.”

Guards Woody Hill and Jerry
Blackstock, and tackles Stu!
Perry and Steve Simmons will
add much needed depth to the
line. Phil Hightower and Jim)
Rollins are developing well at,
end, while halfbacks Pack Hind-
sley; John Little, and Steve
Smith will deepen the backfield. |

Benny Coxton, who was laid
off last season because of a
shoulder injury is participating
in spring practice with a clean
bill of health from Duke Hospi-
tal. Dole feels that he is showing
his old form and that the Wild-
cats are better set at quarter-
back this year than ever, with
Coxton, Earl Cole, and Thomp-
kins in this position.

‘Net Team Starts

After losing to a strong Cita-
del team, the Davidson College
Tennis Team begins a week-long
southern tour tomorrow with a
match with Furman at Green-
ville.

Following the Furman match,
the Cat netters continue their
trip southward to meet five
other teams in a like number of
days. The netmen will meet
Valdosta State, Rollins, Florida
Southern, Stetson and close the

tona on April 5.

mark is team captain Number 1

or two of the matches.”

‘In the Citadel match, Austell

The ‘Cats played their third
game of the season yesterday
Sunday they
will start on their own southern
trip visiting Georgia Southern
and Mercer before returning
home April 6 to start confer-
ence play.

After two games with the sur-
prisingly strong Pfeiffer Col-
lege squad the 'Cats have a 0-2
record, losing 11-1 and 84. The
latar loss was inflicted last
Friday at Pfeiffer in a game
characterized by sloppy play on
both sides.

The ’Cats’ starter Dave John
son hurled 6 good innings giving
up only an unearned run in the
first and an equally sketchy one
in the third on a walk, a stolen
base, and a scratch single. By
the sixth he had been staked to
a 2 run lead by third baseman
Tommy Whitley’s 400 ft. 2 run
homer.

But in the seventh the roof
fell in on the by-then tired
Johnson. He gave up four sin-
gles sandwiched around two in-
field errors without getting any
one out. By the time Jim Moore
could put out the fire Pfeiffer
had scored five runs and vir-
tually sewed up the game. Ron-

U. S. Wrestling Team
To Train Under Parke

BY JOHNNY CLARK

Sports Staff Writer

Davidson will temporarily become the collegiate
wrestling center of the United States on April 9 when
members of the United States wrestling team arrive 0”
campus for a week long training session with their team

coach, Charlie Parker.

Parker, who is also Davidson's wrestling coach, re-
ports that the team will leave Miami for Sao Paulo,
Brazil, on April 17 to participate in the Pan American
Games which begin on April 20.

“The United States won all eight wrestling gold
medals in the 1959 games,” relates Parker. “We are
definitely favored to capture the team championship
again, but I doubt that we will match our 1959 perform-
ance.”

Team members are former NCAA cham Andy |
Fitch of the New York Athletic Club; Bill Riddle from
Hazel Park, Mic ; former NCAA champ Ron Finley
of Oregon State; Gregg Ruth of the U. S. 'y; Dennis

from San Francisco; and heavyweight Joe James of
Oklahoma State. _ ; :
