Netters F: ‘nish 21 2.
Enter SC Tournament

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Favored by most to win the
tournament title, the Davidson
Wildcats. regular season cham-
pions this year, advance to the
Southern Conference Tour-
nament this weekend.

Finishing the season with con-
vincing wins over conference
foes Richmond, William and
Mary and The Citadel, the Cats
will face major challenges from
Appalachian and Furman in the
tourney.

Head Coach Jeff Frank
thought that the team was
“really up for the tournament
and in good shape both
physically and mentally.

‘We will be in the best shape
for titles in both the number
three singles and the number
one doubles,” explained Frank.

The Wildcats swept through
their regular season matches
with conference members
without a mark against their
record. They finished on top of
the standings with a 7-0 con-
ference mark and 21-2 overall.

In the drawing tor seeds held
Wednesday night by the eight
coaches, Davidson came out as
well as could be expected in
seven of the nine divisions.

David Weaver was placed
second in the number one
singles division. This turned out
to be very advantageous as the
top plyers from both Ap-
palachian and Furman are in
the same semifinal bracket.
Weaver will not have to face
either of them until the final
round.

In the number two singles,
Kevin Menton was seeded first.
Once again the Mountaineer
and Paladin entries in this
secion are paired in the same
second round bracket.

The same holds true for Bill
Allen in the number .three
singles division. He was seeded
first in the drawing.

In the fourth singles position,
Maarten Ruys got the bid for
second seed. The Furman net-
ter in the section was picked
first, but he is in the same
semifinal biacket with his Ap-

palachian Counterpart

The number one doubles team
of Weaver and Ruys was seeded
first in the same semifinal
bracket with a tough team from
William and Mary. Once again.
though. the representatives
from Furman and Appalachian
found themselves in the same
semis slot.

Furman got the first seed in
the number two doubles
position, while Menton and
Allen captured the number two
seeding. However. they face the
duo from Appalachian in the
opening round

What this means, according
to Frank. ts that “one of us « Ap-
palachian or Davidson) will be
hurt badly in the first) round
since the loser will be knocked
completely out of a= division
without scoring any points.”

The Davidson tennis
program, although very decent
in its own right, relies on the
talents of two of this year's ex-
change students, Kevin Menton
and Maartin Ruys. Both have
played key roles in the success
of the Wildcat netters.

Ruys, a native of the
Netherlands, found out about
Davidson through a contact
with the late Coach Harry
Fogleman.

‘An old Davis Cup player got
in contact with my parents and
I ended up writing Coach
Fogleman, eventually going
through the application
procedures to Davidson,’’ com-
mented Ruys.

Having been here for almost a
year, Ruys has “throughly en-
joyed”’ his stay and has found
the changes quite interesting.

“I've been very pleased. It is
a very nice country,’ com-
mented Ruys.

However, the Hollander has
found the treatment of tennis to
be quite dirrerent from that of
his homeland.

sett got the second seed in the
number three doubles slot. But
their counterparts from
William and = Mary. Ap-
palachian and Furman are all
in the same halt of the pairings.
leaving this Davidson com-
bination in great position.

It is important to remember
that points are awarded to a
team for each victory by one of
its entries

The advantage that the Cats
have ts that in seven of the nine
Furman and Appalachian meet
betore the final round. Thus
they will be able to eliminate
each other
Davidson

“Hopetully they (Furman
and Appalachian) will split vie-
tories so that neither of them
can amass very many team
points going into the finals.”
Frank expressed

“The game is played in
classes, but you always play
with someone better or just as
good as yourself,”’ he said. ‘‘In
addition, there is not that much
emphasis placed on conference
championships and records as
there is here."

Ruys found the treatment of
tennis at Davidson to be quite
unique.

While being impressed with
the fine facilities, Ruys is
somewhat displeased with the
importance of tennis with
respect ot other sports at David-
son.

‘He commented, ‘I think as
compared to the two big sports,
tennis is probably not the best
sport here but we don't get
enough attention.

Eyeing the conference meet
with optimism, Ruys, playing in
the number four singles
position, feels the team has a
good chance to winning the
tournament title.

Upon completion of this year,
Ruys_ will return to the
Netherlands and enter medical
school.

Sailors Make Bid For Nationals

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

Davidson sailors will par-
ticipate in their last regatta of
the South Atlantic In-
tercollegiate Sailing
Association's regular season
this weekend.

Last weekend the team fought

“puffy and shifty winds up to 30
knots’ in the Ohio State In-
tersectional Regatta. There
were 11 other schools of the
Midwest College Sailing
Association participating.

Daryl Douglas commented to
the fact that ‘strong winds

made it a real mess’ when
people tried to sail.
The sailing continued

throughout the first day until
one boat's mast broke. At that
point, the regatta was discon-
tinued.

“We had sailed reasonably
well,’ noted Douglas. ‘It was
not our best regatta, though.”

After the first races, David-
‘son was situated in sixth place.

“The third through seventh
place teams were. only
separated by nine points,”
Douglas was quick to point out.
‘We had a good chance to move

up, but we never got the op-
portunity."

Notre Dame eventually won
the match.

Davidson will be! given one
more opportunity to go to the
National Championships.
Douglas will represent the Cats
in the SAISA’s single hand
championships.

‘‘We've been sailing our Jets
cat-rigged (with just the main-
sail) this week during practice,
since I will be sailing this way
at Clemson," said Douglas.

The top two skippers in this
meet will go to the nationals.
Last year Jimmy Hunter won

this intercollegiate regatta,
thus being able to go to the
national finals.

TREMENDOUS CONCENTRATION
Maarten Ruys hits another return for Davidson.

Cats ‘Import’ Aid For Tennis Program

ternational duo, and very much
an asset to the Wildcat tennis
team, is Kevin Menton, now
playing in the second singles
position and the number two
doubles with Bill Allen.

A native of Dublin, Ireland
and presently an exchange
student from Trinity University
of Dublin, Menton was also
referred to Davidson by a con-
tact of Fogleman.

Menton explained, ‘I had been
interested in coming to the
States and it was very fortunate
that I was able to have a
scholarship arranged for me to
come to the States and David-

Menton is also here solely for
this year and will return to
Trinity to complete his studies
in economics. ‘I have been
especially impressed with the
friendly nature of Davidson,
most especially with the guys
on the tennis team," he said.

In evaluating the Davidson
tennis program, Menton con-
sidered the facilities to be ‘first
class" and the most impressive
part of the program here.

“Tennis is just taken for gran-
ted here,’’ Menton stressed.
‘‘People expect us to win the
conference title.

*‘With many of the schools in
this area now giving several
scholarships, it is making it
more and more difficult for a
team like Davidson tosucceed."

“I really think that in years to
come Davidson tennis will be in
trouble and encounter dif-
ficulties unless some scholar-

ships are started,’ he con-
cluded.
Also optimistic about the con-

ference title, Menton will play
at the number two slot relying
on his powerful forehand and
steadiness.
