Innocent Black Students Stopped by Campus Police

Some Question Officers' Motives; Do Racial Biases Cause Harrassment of African-Americans?

‘By Mandy Curtis

Two black students, Cedric
Westand Chris Leak, were stopped
by the Davidson police on Mon-
day, March 22. West and Leak
were walking back from Baker at
nightbetween 10:00and 11:00 and
were stopped in front of the Sig Ep
house on their way to their dorm.
The police questioned who they
»wvere and asked to see their

Davidson identification.
Leak explained that he saw
- thepolice maninhiscushman twice
before he stopped them: once as

they came out of Baker and the
second time when he passed them
in front of the Pika house. Accord-
ing to West and Leak, they were
not doing anything wrong, causing
any trouble, or bothering anyone
that would warrant reason for the
police to stop them.

West said that this was not the
first time this has happened to him
or Leak. Westhas been stopped by
the campus police and asked to
identify himself five times since
he arrived at Davidson as a fresh-
man last year.

Leak added that he has also been
stopped by the police on campus
twice this school year.

According to West, he and
Leak were stopped first semester
upon leaving a KA party. He ex-
plained that they arrived at the
party in a car, parked, went in for
about five minutes, left the party,
and drove to Irwin. The same
police they had seen outside of the
KA house followed them to the
dorm. When they parked their car
the officer asked who they were
and to show him their Davidson

identification. »

On both of the two occasions
this year West and Leak said that
they did not say anything to the
officers but simply showed them
their IDs “I just bit my tongue and
left it at that because I didn’t want
to start any trouble that might lead
to something else,” explained
West.

West said, “I don’t like it and
I don’t understand why they con-
tinue to doit.” Leak added, “There
aren’t but a handful of us; it’s not
hard to know our faces." Rick

Moore of the campus police ex-
plained that it is “procedure for an
officer to question the identity” of
a person whom they do not recog-
nize oncampus. He says that there
is “nothing to take offense to” but
that students should appreciate the
fact that the officers are out on
campus looking after the safety of
the student body. .

Moore stated that he does not
know why these two students
looked suspicious when the police

Discusses
Sexual
Orientation

Students have not always felt
comfortable being gay or lesbian
at Davidson. Students may still
not feel comfortable, but they have
had an opportunity to relate their
feelings of discomfort’-ant: diffie
culty in a campus-wide forum
which drew an audience of over
300.

The forum held the eveningof

March 7 in the 900 Room featured
three college students and two pro-
fessionals. The students included
a current Davidson senior and a
former Davidson student who
transferred last year. The panel
discussed, “Being Gay and Les-
bian in the Real World,” specify-
_ ing personal examples.

“I’ve wanted to do this forum
for four years,” started senior pan-
elist Meg Jones, “and until this
moment I’ve always thought noth-
ing made me more nervous than

talking in class!” Union commit- -

Seeing little on the current text-
book market that served their stu-
dents well, professors Peter Hess
and Clark Ross decided to write a
‘thinking student’s” introductory
economics textbook.

- The result, Principles of Eco-
nomics: An Analytical, Approach,
was published this month by West
Publishing Company of St. Paul,
Minnesota. Instead of following
the popular graphics-laden format,
the book focuses on econom ic rea-

soning and the relevance of eco-
nomic theories. At 650 pages, the
book is about one third shorter
than most economic textbooks.
Hess and Ross explained the
reasoning behind these changes in

the books preface, “The current -

attention to excellence in educa-
tion, the renewed interest in math
and science in the curriculum, and
the challenge to compete in the
international marketplace all sug-
gest that the time is right for a
streamlined, analytical text in eco-

Because their primary activ-
ity formore than ten years has been
classroom teaching, they. have
strong beliefs about what students
“T don’t

from undergraduate teaching can
write an effective text, “ said Ross.
“T’ve learned as much over the
years from what students have got-
ten wrong as what they’ve gotten

Davidson
Accepts
Strongest
Class Ever

By Rachel Dunifon
Hours of diligent work by
Davidson’s Admissions staff paid
off this year in the acceptance of

“what Deborah” Hogg, Assistant

Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid, calls “the strongest profile we
have ever accepted at Davidson.”
The accepted students, numbering
about 900, have an average rank in

the top third percentile of their

high schools, and a mean SAT

score of 1300. “We are really

skimming off of the top with this

class,” says Hogg.

162 of the accepted students
received early acceptance notifi-
cation, wiifle the other decision
letters were issued on March 15.
The deadline for the students to
commit to Davidson is May 1, and «
the Admissions office hopes to
yield a minimum of 420 students
out of this group by then.

The accepted profile consists
of a roughly even ‘split between
males and females, from 44 states
and 22 foreign countries. The eth-
nic groups represented include 31
African-Americans, 2 Africans, 39
Asian-Anfericans, 3 Native-
Americans, and 19 Hispanic-
Americans.

According to Hogg, the high
quality of this year’s acceptance
