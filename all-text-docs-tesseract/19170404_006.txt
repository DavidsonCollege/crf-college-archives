DAVIDSON SPLITS SERIES

(Continued from page \)
pitchers’ battle between Worth and Pe
gram, neither side tbeing able to score.
Withers replaced Worth in the sixth,
and pitched good ball for the next threc
innings, striking out five men and walk-
ing but one. However, the Davidson
infield went up in the seventh inning,
and this fact, coupled with the four hit.
parnered by Oak Ridge off Withers,
gave the visitors seven runs and the
game. Garrison went in the box fo:
Davidson in the last inning, and showed
up well.

One of the chief reasons for Oak
Ridge’s victory was the pitching ot Pe-
gram. Fle struck out 13 men and only
walked two. Mayberry also played a
yood game for Oak Ridge. getting four

hits and scoring one run, Line-up:

the company meet three times cach week

on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
night-, in the Gymnasium,
Increased interest is manifested a!

every drill. Starting with only a few
the number has steadily enlarged until
now nearly one hundred students are en-
rolled. ‘hose that have had previow
training in military schools are directing

Much of the success and interest in

leadership and help of B. D. Reddey,
W. D. Lawson and “Bob” Walker.
