Wait Until Dark combines diverse elements

¢ By MARK CHEN.

Wait Until Dark is anumber of
fine movies put together. Part of it
is a look at how the blindStruggle

with drag smugglers and their
sleazy world. Yet another part is
unbridled violence. The strong
men.in this movie are either pow-
erless or evil. The weak, cringing
heroine must fend for herself.
Elaborate deceptions come on top

of other deceptions. It is asmystery’

same time it breaks out with sud-
den, cruel violence, something
which would have been distasteful
to Ms. Christie. The movie-is a
bundle of contradictions and sur-
prises which somehow work all
together,
The movie begins with an old

Now, I’d been on vacation for a
week or so, and hadn’t been
exactly caught up on my STAR
newspaper, but it still surprised
me to hear that that Cher actress
person had gotten married again. I
knew she’d been married to some
little Sonny Eyetalian fellow, then
got it up with Gregg Allman, but I
didn’t even hear about Cher
foolin’ around with no Noble per-
son. Being a curious sort of guy, I
decided to head over to the 900

takes the doll and goes to the air-
port. She catches a plane for New
York and arrives there, still carry-
ing the doll in her arms. But then
she sees a fairly sinister figure
waiting for her at the terminal.
She hands the doll to a stranger
she met on the plane, and then
goes to meet the man waiting ‘for
her. The movie then makes a sud-
den switch to a nice New York
neighborhood.

Two men are looking for a
particular apartment in the neigh-
borhood. Mike Talman, played by

Richard Crenna, is a partner with -

the woman on the plane. Carlino,
played by Jack Weston, is also
part of the gang. They come to the
right apartment but find no one
there. Just as they are about to
leave, the Sinister man from the
airport enters the apartment. He is

when he told us all that he was

yet another person. enters the
apartment. Susy Hendrix, played
by Audrey Hepburn, walks past
them standing in full view without
seeing them. She turns out to be
married to Sam, the stranger who
received the doll. She also hap-

what he had to say next. As Dr. .

produces more power than six
Chrysler 440 engines, melt right
down to the core and let out a
whole lotta steam. If that weren’t
trouble enough, the steam was
radio-active and coulda cooked up
several rolls of Jimmy Dean pork
sausage. To make it into an even
bigger dog, the Russians ‘didn’t
tell anybody about this lil’ acci-
dent, and didn’t even mention it
until some Swedes noticed that
their lettuce was glowing in the
dark. The leader of the Russians,
Gorbachev, got in hot water for
keeping quiet for so long, because
just a couple weeks before he had
announced to everybody that the
Russians were going to get mod-
ern and start having more infor-
mation given out.

come and go. They are always
present in her apartment or across
the street. Not only is she without
sight, but she is also without
knowledge of the deceits sur-
rounding her. The tension grows
until it is released in a fashion as
bloody as any mad slasher movie.

The performances are all good
in this movie and are reason
enough to-see Wait Until Dark. As
Mike Talman, Crenna works well
as the handsome hero who seems
too good to be true, thé strong man
to save the helpless victim. But
Hollywood stereotypes have no
place in this movie. He is also the
deceiver who\ must be around
Susy all the tite in order to play
his double-game. His character
grows more complex as the movie
progresses. Weston plays a kind
of bumbling sidekick, not a large
“role but one which he performs
well. Arkin has a-difficult role at:

the ultimate creep. At first Arkin

Dr. Williams thinks that infor-
mation is at the center of the entire
Russian conflict. Not the type of
information you dial when you
don’t know somebodies’ phone
number, but the kind that persons
who are real smart give to each
other. To give this information to
each other, the Russians need lots
of computers, but if they get all
these computers, then Gorbachev
and his buddies are going to lose
total control of their people,
which they’re not exactly hanker-
ing to do. sf)

Another question the Russian
got is with this Star Wars plan. I
didn’t see how sending plenty of
copes of that kiddie movie over
there would cause a ruckus, but
Dr. Williams said that Star Wars
is really a defense plan to keep the
U.S. safe from atom bombs by
using computers and missles.
Gorbachev kinda likes Star Wars
because it makes the Russians all

comes across as a joke, a carica- -
ture of evil. But he grows more
sinister as the plot develops, until
he becomes frightening to the au-

dience. The best performance is
by Hepburn as Susy Hendrix. She
is very believable as a blind per-
son who must take on the world.
Vulnerable and nearly helpless at
the beginning of the movie, she
grows stronger until she faces all
three men on héf own. Her role ‘is
at the heart of this movie, helping
all its other. parts through the
strength of her performance.

shocks where the others startle.

scared so they’ll learn how to use
those computers, but at the same
time Star Wars might make for a
technology war, where they’d
finish second in a two-horse race.

Last problem Dr. Williams
talked about is a reporter named
Daniloff, who the Russians threw
in jail for getting them riled. once
again we got two sides of the Rus-
sian picture. Gorbachev goes tel-
ling people that he wants more
common-sense levels of produc-
tion, elimination of waste and laz-
iness as well as a national chain of
computers, then he throws a high-
speaking reporter in jail just for
doing what he’d get an award for
back here. ‘As far as I'can figure,
this is an example of Russia in a
nutshell. On one side of their
mouth, they’ re talking all progres-
sive and computers, but onpthe
other side they-stilt want the old
ways and have their old fears.
