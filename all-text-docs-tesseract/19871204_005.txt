Faculty discuss human rights on AI panel

By MARGARET CARROLL

On Wednesday night Amnesty
International and the Dean Rusk
Program sponsored a panel dis-
cussion on human rights in four
regions. Dr. Lafayette Diggs, Dr.
Grant Jones, Dr. Jack Perry, and
Dr. Lakhi Sabaratnam discussed
Liberia, Guatemala, Eastern Eu-
rope, and Sri Lanka, respectively.
After each of the professors
spoke, the audience asked ques-
tions about the media’s role in the
area Of human\ rights and the

improvement in the various coun--

tries. In beginning the panel dis-
cussion Sabaratnam explained the
purpose of Amnesty Interna-
tional, which speaks for the re-
lease of prisoners of conscience
and hopes to eliminate the tortur-
ing of all prisoners.

‘ Diggs began the talk by discuss-
ing the limitations upon human
rights which exist in Liberia. He
explained that much conflict in
Africa is a result of African goals
to eradicate racial conflict and to
correct the imbalance between the
rich and the poor. He said that

Davidson’s chapter of Omicron
Delta Kappa (ODK) tapped its
new members this week. Mem-
bers chosen this fall are seniors
Lauren Brooke Adams, James
Edwin Earle, Laura Olivia Fan-
nin, Gaulden Reed Herrero, Wil-
liam Van. Dorn Young, Amy
Lynne Cheek, and juniors Harry
Smoak Bryant,Jr., Ronald Craig
Carlock Jr.,. Molly Maude Co-
chran, Samuel Thomas Cutting,
Julia Sneade McCrory, and Sarah
Louise Whitesides.

ODK is a national leadership
honor society, founded on the
ideals and leadership of George
Washington and Robert E. Lee.
ODK was founded at Washington
and Lee University in 1914, and
Davidson’s chapter was founded
in 1917. ODK was founded upon
“the idea that leadership of excep-
tional quality and versatility in
college should be recognized, that

representatives in all phases of.

college life should cooperate in a
worth-while endeavor, and that

outstanding students, faculty, and
administration members should
meet on a basis of mutual interest,
understanding and helpfulness.”

Members of ODK are chosen as
juniors and seniors twice a year, in
the fall and spring; and they must
be in the upper 35% of their class.
Members must also have dis-
played leadership in one or more
of five areas: scholarship; athlet-
ics; social, service, and religious
activities, and campus govern-
ment; journalism, speech, and the
mass media; and creative and per-
forming arts.

ODK carries out two: major
projects each year: practice job
and graduate school interviews
for seniors in January, and the
ODK outstanding teacher award
each spring.

ODK members are president
Andy Bright, Karen Coppedge,
Vincent Knight, Sarah Payne,
Mike - Poulos, Derek Rucker,
Gretchen Schoel, Holly Sparks,
Todd Wallenius, Eric Whytsell,
and Rob Zimmerman.

‘neither goal will ever be realized

until peace and stability are also
achieved.

Because the two types of gov-
ernment in Africa are military and
authoritarian, decisions are. al-
ways made from the highest level
and sent down, Diggs said. Libe-
rians cannot even joke about their
leader or a member of their
laeder’s family, and if they do,
they will be beaten and tortured.

In Liberia human rights viola-
tions occur in several forms: dis-

appearances, imprisonment,and—

torture, “Pumping the tire” and
“letting the tree fall” are two
common tortures: a prisoner who
“pumps the tire” must put his fin-
gers in his ears and do deep knee
bends continuously, while a pris-
oner who “lets the tree fall” must
fall onto the ground, face forward,
without using any part of his body
to stop himself. Liberian prisons

are overcrowded and do not pro-
vide food or toilet facilities. They
are called “horror chambers,” and
many never return from them.
Next, Perry spoke on Eastern

Europe and explained that the”

human rights situation is different
in every Eastern European coun-
try. Albania forbids religion to
exist at all; Bulgaria represses its
Turkish minority; Czechoslova-
kia attempts to supress the
Church. In general, however,
each of the communist regimes
restricts human rights by holding —
political prisoners and sur-
pressing religion.

The Soviet Union seems to have
been improving its human rights
record since Gorbachev’s ascen-
sion to power, but many still ques-
tion the freedom of the religious
Soviets. Because 1988 will be the
thousandth anniversary of the
Orthodox Church’s entry into

Russia, more attention may soon
be focused on the fate of religious
believers in the USSR.

Speaking on Guatemala, Jones
noted that common forms of
human rights abuses are disap-
pearances, open village mas-
sacres, and torture. Between 1978
and 1986 over 100,000 Guatema-
lans have died as a result of non-
war violence. From 1956 to 1986
the militaryregime brought some
of the worst violence imaginable
to Guatemala as it sought to de-
~stroy all opposition. ~~ .

In each of these countries the
media has not reported human
rights abuses for several reasons,
the most important one being that
it is too dangerous. Each of the

“professors agreed that Amnesty

International makes government
leaders aware of world opinion,
which must always be one of a
leader’s mostimportant concerns.
