College Remains
Financially Sound

Through June 30

By RICH WILSON

Scoring his finst triumph
since he became Vice Presi-
dent for Finance and De-
lopment, C. Daviid (Cornell
has announced that David-
son College remained finan-
cially in the black during the
fiscal year ending June 30,
1971.

Although the final figures
have not been tabulated, the
auditors, who presently are
scrutinizing budget figures,
have stated thiat they believe
the college will not suffer a

“Just how much we will
have left over will be deter-
mined in September when
the auditors submit their
final report, but it won't be
much,"’ said Cornell.

“Back in May the financial
situation looked pretty
bleak,"’ the said. ‘‘The way
expenses were going we
thought sure we would end
up én the red.”

At that time a memo which
was sent to ail departments,
in effect froze ‘all funds from
being spent unless adminis-
trative approval was given.

“This was done so that a
department wouldn't fool-
ishly spend any money they
might thave left over from
the year’s expenses,’ Cor-
nell said.

“Although freezing funds
was not a popular decision
with the faculty, I do believe
it was the primary factor
which put us over into the
biack,’’ he said.

Cornell also mentioned
that the faculty and admin-
istration were ‘asked “not to

make long distance phone
calls or trips unless it was
absolutely necessary.
Another factor which added
ithe college's financial situ-
avion was that the Annual
Fund Drive netted $180,000.

maved ito ‘the college by

of the college. Since these
funds are not earmarked for
any special project, they are
often used to balance the
budget.

Cornell said that the lea-
dership conference held
March 27, gave the biggest
boost to the Annual Fund.

‘We inviited the key men
in the alumni to visit the
college so that they could
ask questions concerning
many of the practicies and
potllicies here,”’ he said.

“We also intensified the
telephone campaign. For in-
stance from tthe class of '58,
about 23° fellows sat down
one Sunday afternoon and
tried ito call most of the

‘class members,"’ he contin-

ued.

“One guy they called had
never given to the college
before, ‘and had only attend-

C. David Cornell breathes a sigh of relief as college remains financially in the black.

Workshops May Replace
Sagging Summer School

The summer: school which
ended last week may be the
last regular summer session
held att Davidson.

College officials are be-
ginning to openly discuss the
possibility of abolishing the
regular summer school in
favor of workshops and. in-
stitutes which would attract
more enrolles ‘and thus more
effectively use college facili-
ties.

Previously it has been aca-

demic policy that any stu-
dent who faills a course dur-
‘ng. {the regular academic
year must make up the de-
ficiency at the Davidson
summer school.

‘But when the new aca-
demic regulations were pass-
ed in June, the faculty abo-
lished this restriction.

Now, ‘any student who fails
a course or for any reason
doesn't complete a course
may ‘attend an accredited

giving, coordinator of student
activities, and director of
career service are filled.
Greg Scott, who graduated
in June and received the Al-
gernon Sydney award.,. will
succeed Peter Hobbie as
Assistant to the President.

Scott, a former president
of the YMCA, hall counselor,
and honors college veteran,
will represent the presi-
dent's office in various col-
lege activities, and organize
programs for special. events
including convocations and
trustee meetings.

“In addition to being an
outstanding person, Greg has
had good organizational ex-
perience and will help make
the president's office more
efficient and effective,”’ said
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

“Since Greg is the general
age ievel of the student
body, I hope we will develop
strong relationships with the
siudents and student organi-
zations,’’ Spencer said.

In other changes, lan end
of an era has come in David-
son’s food service as Klaus
Kleeburg departs to work for
ARA Slater's dining service

at the University of South
Carolina.

“‘Kilaus has been here a
long time and has had to
contend with high food costs
and better quality demiands
from ‘the siudents,"’ said Vice
President for ‘Finance and
Development C. David Cor-
nell.

“IT have great respect for
Mr. Kleeburg,"’ he continued.
“It is extremely difficult to
run a food service when you
have such a smaill volume of
meals to prepare as is the
case here.”

Kleeburg will be replaced
by Ronald Scott who worked
previously as the dining ser-
vice manager of The Citadel
for ARA Slater.

Ronald Nordeen, currently
director of estate planning at
Pomona College, has been
named director of deferred
giving at Davidson, ‘accord-
ing to Cornell.

Nordeen, 38, hias been on
the Pomona College develop-
ment staff since 1965 and
has been in his present po-
sition since 1968.

college or university nea
his home during tthe summer.

The college has found that
students would rather take
summer courses at home,
since by doing so they would
cut down room iand board
expenses.

And many students have
found that they can take a
summer course lat a nearby
university for approximately
$40 or $50, whereas a sum-
mer course at Davidson
costs $200.

“I think it's basically fi-
nances,” said Richard C.
Burts Jr., registrar. ‘‘Since
students are no longer re-
quired to make up ‘a credit-
ed course here, it certainly
is financially cheaper to
make it up at a unievrsity
near the student's home."

While the financial consi-
deration is important, Burts
also mentioned that many
students realize courses at
Davidson are oftentimes
more difficult than those. at a
university . ‘Consequently,
most students aren't going
to walk into the buzz saw to
inake up a deficiency,”’ Burts
said.

During ‘the first term of
summer school this year 10
courses were offered, but

- only seven materialized. And

of the eight courses offered
second term only four were
actually taught.

Approximately 65 students
attended the first session
and 36, the second, accord-
ing to Burts.

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David
Cornell said that summer
school is mot necessarily a
financial liability, ‘but he
felt that the college facili-
ties could be used in ‘a more
effective manner.
