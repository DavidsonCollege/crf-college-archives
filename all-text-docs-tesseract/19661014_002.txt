Hasty Decision

You can say what you want, David-
son is not bound by tradition, and the
place certainly isn't reluctant to un-
deriake change, As a matter of fact,
it appears that on ocuasion change
mov be undertaken simply far
chaonge's sake,

The faculty open house system has
Ppeen changed again, aiter only one
venture into the firs! altersalive
adopted, The faculty’s “Religious Com-
mittee,” os the pro tempore group
has Been dubbed for lack of a better
name, has determined that affer the
last Sunday in October. faculty mem-
bers will no longer open thei hames.
to students in general.

Instead, professors will be ancour-
‘aged to invite students encountered in
classes and in other activities to thelr
homes at s time specified by the pro-
fessors. The progrum be tried
through the months of November,
December and January,

Not only are there a number of
nbjections lo the projected framework
— there is some doubt as ta the wis
dom of undertaking it without giving
the current scheme an opportunity to
prove itself. Prospects for the campus-
wide open houses, something like the
old after-vespers open houses, ware
encouraging: 47 faculty and adminis-
tration members agreed to hold open
house daring October.

Overextension

There are evidences that excesses in
Davidson's social) life may be running
toward extremes. Admitted deficien-
eles in the availability of on-campus
activities on weekends forced in 1965
the formation of the Social Council to
take over entertainment functions pre-
viously udministered by the Intefra-
terternity Cuunefl. The Social Council,
using funds from the newly eztablish-
ed student soctal fee, was 10 fashion a
more complete framework of soctal ac-
tivities for the entire campus.

But last weekend's activities, cam-
plete with two bands, indleates the
campus may be reaching a saturation
point in planned activities. There were
searcely 50 dates at all Saturday's ac-
tivities, s ridiculously jow number,
The planning and effort, in say noth-
ing of the money, that accompany such
aativities. are not justified when the
student hady demonstrates no more
interest than this.

The concept of 2 suitcase college

One justification for the naw system
of inviting only certain students to an
open house is that the professor can

ain more direet contact with studants
e wants to know better. But what of
the students who wanls to know 2
professor better, but has no direat
contact with the professor? Unless the
student already has an “in” with the
rofessor, he's unlikely to be invited
o on open house.

The committee also expects the naw
Pian to got a hetter student response,
as undoubtedly it will. But just a5 cer-
tain is the fact that a number of stu-
denis will go, not heeauce of any in-
{erest in visiting the professor, but
from a Seeling of obligation.

A pumber of professors have also
voiced some discontent with the cant
pus-wide open house system, stom-
ming from an inability to predict the
number of students who will respond
to the visiting privilege. Admittedly
it's somewhat frustraung for a wife
to fix elaborate refreshments for 20
and be greeted by five stadents, hut
few students visit a professor for the
goodies he serves. Cokes and cookies
are as good 9s cake and parfalt.

We feel the campus-wide open hause
plan far superior to the restricted in-
Vilntion idea, but it seems that even
those that can't share our eathusissm
would be willing to give the plan a
chance to prove itself,

has its positive aspects. To wish for
lis opposite extreme lz ahsurd—no one
should be expected to stay within the
confines of Davidson every weekend,
when few students have any better
time to get away. Nor should the So-
ial Counci] try to encourage such a
development.

Ovcasions such as last weekend cre-
ate a somewhal awkward sitvation:
There's not enough activity to justify
a stuclent’s bringing a date from any
plave farther than Charlotta (not that
we have any objection to any of the
numerous institutions for ladles from
which Davidson gentlemen ordinarily
date In Charlotte). But such medium-
sized weekends result in limitations on
an ambdtlous student's social life.

The Social Couneil occupies an in
fegral place on ihe campus. But by
stepping info an over-ambitious pro-

ram and attempting to sponsor enter-
ainment for every weekend, it could
possitly restrict its very effectiveness.

Deferred Opportunity

Ata school where 70 per cent of the
raduates go on to grad school, and
fhe remainder ordinarily immediately
enter one of ihe arnied services. {1's
sometimes difficult for seniars to ac-
knowledge the fact that one day school
will be out and they'll be faced with
the unattractive prospect of looking
for a job.

Davidson offer: one of the best
placement services of any school in
the country, yet it faces more than its
share of problems, caased primarily
by most seniors’ lack of any immediate
interest in work, The number of stu-
Gents who have signed up for place-
jent tke session is pitifully Jow.

Few students are aware of the ben
efits that may eventually accrue to
those taking advantage of the place-
ment service now. When a man, oul

uf college for several yeors, begins
sentching for wark, his praspects will
be hevsted immensely should he al-
ready have a record on file, begun
during his undergraduate years.

Nol only ts taking advantage of the
service benefictal to the indlvidual, it
will also help to Improve the quality of
the service a5 a whole. Having a large
number of seniors going through

Jacement makes the service more at-
ractive to prospective employers and
consequently widen the range of avail-
able jobs.

Personne! connected with the place-
ment service. hoth in the Coltege Un-
joo and Student Counseling Office,
are wiltting to go to any length to
make the program effective. Prospec-
live graduates should shake off the
robe of Hstlessness and do the same.

Religion, 1966 Style

The perlod of public maurning over
the death of God seems to hove pass-
ed: a biz thing in religious symbols is
pow a Yellow Submarine, the Holy
Trinity has become a quartet, and the
Alleluia Chorus requires an electric

guitar.

Needless to sav this is the Year of
Our Lord—1068, B.C—B.C, being, of
course, Bestie Century. The Western
world ls hearing the first cries of wor-
ship thie week: ‘John not Jesus.” And
as is true of most deftics, the popalar-
ity of the current idols ke suddenly du-
bious.

Obviously when John Lennon—the
Beatle sitting highest an Mount Olym-
pus—announced gome weeks age that
“the Bentles are more popular thon
Jesus,” he undoubtedly thought that
he was merely stating fact. It seems,
however. that at that point he had in-
Histed a cull.

Long worshinped bul wever official-
ly sanctified, the Beatles began same-
what unobtrusively in a place called
the Cavera in Liverpoo!, England. The
whole set-up was not much unlike the
manger steno where Christ made his
first appearance 2.00 years before.
People came and kind of stared—bolth
at the Infant Christ nnd Ioter al the
ainpters.

Other similaritles cannot be easily

overlooked ither. Both Christ and the
Beatles were fated for destinies with
the stars, both performed miracles
(the Beatles being able to Gurn docile,
apathetic, teenage girls into screaming
bensts), both experienced surging pop-
wlarity and lacge follawings only to
find themselves eventually called biss-

phemers,
Both Christ ani the Beatles knew
they were doomed . .. rock and roll

und religian are fickle. The Beatles
have been waiting for “their downfall"
for several months now Both have wit-
nessed angry mobs It may not be lon
before fanatics are throwing rocks 2
the Beatles instead of kisses.

Sigaificantly, ihe Beatles evan have
a Eospel of their own. Twentleth cen-
titty communication has enabled the
singers Io reach thousands without the
aid of loaves and fishes Their words
are immortally inscribed on dines .. -
Lyrics such a6 those af Nowhere Man
and Eleanor Righy are as cidactical
and though!-provoking as the sermons
of Christ.

And why shouldn't the Beatles be-
come the suecessorz to Christ? They're
olive, enthusiastic, currant, and pal-
ptnble. Besides it's Just as casy to say
“Tohn, Paul, George and Hingo'' as
it is to say “Father, Son and Holy

Ghost."

On Being Small Time

__ My Jast column, on September 30, was on the
Subject of student participation In the determination
of college pollcy; basically I am in favor of increased
student representation, with voting privileges. an all
of the major committees of the faculty. The only
major commitice which 1 exciude fs the Executive
Committee far it only meets on demand, and a stu-
dent niay appeal to it whenever necessary.

There was more included in the column but
through a vicious goof which no ane will acknowl-
edge, the last two paragraphs were omitted when the
columm was finally printed. Therefore, I want to
point out that 1] am in agreement with Lewis S. Feu-
or’s statement that “no matter how much respon-
Sible student self-government emerges, it still re-
mains true that a modern university (college) cannot
be 2 republic of equals. It is based on one essential
presupposition — that knowledge and wisdom are
oross-generational, that the elders have samething to
transmit." T quoted Feuer in order to appease the ap-
prehended vensure of the faculty and administration;

ut at the same Hime I ask my fellow students: Shall
we overcome?

- * 2

In the ten days since that column was published,
T have not personally heard ene word of comment,
pro or con, on the proposals contained in tt—not
from students or faculty. There are several conelu-
sions which one might draw from itis sort of reac-
tion: Nobotly read the column; these people who did
Tead it did not think it worth commenting on; the
readers are not concerned with the subject gener-

ly.

For a yariely of reasons, 1 hesitate to draw any
of the specific conclusions above, but I tend to Jean
toward the last one. Why? Because it seems ta me
that most peopte at Davidson just don‘! think it will
ever happen; voting student representation on these
committees is simply not within the realm of the
possible for most of the members of this community.

This limited conception of the possibilities abead
reminds me of a similar problem which many social
workers encounter when working with children from
underprivilered environments: The children do not
think in terms of becoming anything more than a
mil} worker or a janitor becouse they bave never
personally known anyone who has risen above this
socio-economic level; the social workers flod that
they must remove the alilld's limited conception of
possibie life goals before they can ever get the child
Io strive foward more ambilious goots; [t is a matter
of learning.

In some ways it seems to me that we of the Da-
vidson College community suffer {rom the problem
of kaving impoverished goals in certain areas. | am
coostantly reminded that we seek to be the best so
and £o or to have the best such and such in the South.
We seem unwilling to recognize the progress being
made in vorious areas of the higher education scone
in this countrys we appear to be trying to remain un-
touched by the massive socio-economic revalution
swirling around us; we have never personally known
anyone who has achieved higher gorts than our pres-
ent statis, and thus we do not alm any higher.

. a ~* * , a r 3

Surely zomeone will inalal that ) be more spe-
cific as lo what areas we have lmpoverished goals in
or in whol area we are Ealllng to recognize educa-
tional progress. It Is not my purpose al this paint to
be specific; perhaps before 1 can be more specific in
auch an aron as Increased student participation in

olicy decision making, we must try to remove our
imited conceplion of possible gouls. I don’t think
that there is any particolar process necessary to re-
move these timited conceptions; there are many
ways: Widespread awareness of the problem will
help. We must learn to think in new ways with dif-
ferent quantities, 1 will welcome any comments any
of you might have.

Finally, for those people—faculty and students
—who need a aecinet statement, of precedin 8,1
offer the following: DONT BE §& TIME —
THINIC BIG!
