Graham Reviews Past Annuals, Asks
Prospective Editors To State Esthetic Plans

A REVIEW
By Dan Graham

“We find that our needs
are the same as they have
always been. We continue
in our haphazard way. of
existence, flying from one
trapeze to another, seldom
stopping long enough to ask
what is beneath appear-
ances.”

“Meanwhile, the parties,
firm handshakes, smiles,
and guys with no socks go
on forever. Somehow you

make a few friends you
won't forget, tolerate’ the
rest, and rush in spite of
yourself.” .

These two passages illus-
trate what is wrong with
Davidson annuals. One is
taken from a 1964 year book,
and one from a 1968, but no
difference is discernible.

This is not to say that the
yearbook has not changed
radically in the past two de-

cades. It has come a long
way from the rogues’ gal-
*lery of serried photographs

students here at Davidson,”
tackson commented.

“A major part of my or-
ganization is to be staffed
by politically -savvied — stu-
dents. I am very impress
ed with the real sharpness
and political insight in some

‘people in my courses.

These fellows can handle
anything -—— partly because
they keep believing in the
possibility of change.

Jackson forsées no inter-
ruption of his classes be-
cause of political work this
year, unless a_ tough pri-
mary race develops.

“Once the primary is over
in May, though, and untill
November,"’ he said, life
will be very busy, so I
would not anticipate teach-
ing a full load in the fall
term.”'

chronicled by an aggregate
of sérried facts.

The yearbook has chang
ed radically because of two
important discoveries “made
between 1950 and 1960: 1)
photography and °2) copy.
The development of these
discoveries has made it pos-
sible to now” review the
yearbook as art.

But all too often the photo
graphers have been unimag-
inative and the copy trite
and platitudinous, and the
yearbook has remained sim-
ply a yearbook. And the only
thing to distinguish one year-
book from another for the
student has been the class
in which his photograph was
to be found.

The heights to which a
yearbook can rise has only
once been seen in Davidson
history, in 1967. Ed Dwelle’s
yearbook was, controversial
for any number of reasons,
but it is time to take it out,
dust it off and re-evaluate
it.

It was controversial be-
cause 1) It was a_ parody
of yearbooks, including such
devices as a page of “big
men” on campus. 2) It had
no copy, not a Word, and it,
made you think to figure
out why the collection of
pictures on a page of a
few succeeding pages were
there.

This is an important
question, one ~-that seems
not to have been considered
by the editors of pages 58:
59 of the 1968* yearbook, who
laid out beside some _irrel-
event copy, the photographs
of an _ elephant's. derriere,
a close - up of some photo
graphs of some magnolia

buds, some ice glazed
branches, “and a summer
view of the fountain near

Elm Row,

Finally, the 1967 yearbook
was controversial because it
did not follow the neat

Gay,

_ toeach other...

If you don't like the way people talk
we'll pay you to:

We're in the communications business.

And during the next 30 years we're going to upgrade all the equip-

ment we now have in order to provide even better ‘service to-our 6 million
existing customers.

As if that weren't enough we're also going to have to come up with,

enough new equipment to provide telephone service to about 26 million,
more people. As well as equipment for a much more extensive data com
munications program.

We need enough,people (electrical, civil, mechanical and industrial

engineers, designers, accountants and economists) to plan, design, build
and operate a company that will be four times bigger than we are today.
Wealso need engineers, researchers and scientists to develop electronic
‘switching equipment, laser and other communications systems we'll be
using 10, 25 and 50 years from now.

But this is only one part of our communications business.
Our Sylvania people, for example, are involved in other types of

communications. Like color television sets, satellite tracking stations
and educational television systems.

Automatic Electric, Lenkurt, Ultrpnic Systems and some of our other

companies, subsidiaries and divisions are working on advanced types of
integrated circuitry, electro-opti icals.and communications. systems be-'
tween people and computers and between computers.and computers.!

’ Soif you think you have something to say-about the way people talk:

we’ 're ready to listen. °
