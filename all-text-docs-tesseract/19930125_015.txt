tor, and we’ve realized that we’ve
got to come together,” Butcher
explained. ‘“We’re really focused
rightnow, and we’ ve been coming
together as a team.”

Butcher’s 20 points and ca-
reer-high 19 rebounds guided
Davidson in a 62-49 home victory
over Pfeifferon Monday. The ‘Cats
played their most solid all-around
game of the season, avoiding pro-
longed offensive lapses which have
cost them in other contests and
holding Pfeiffer to 23.3% shooting
from the floor in the second half.
Burke, with six, and Crosswhite,
with 14, combined for 20 points in
keeping a formidable front. Roos
kept Davidson steady on the floor,
and Sharpe (13 points) and
Crosswhite dove aggressively af-
ter balls throughout.

The previous Saturday,
Davidson fell, 73-63, at Wofford;
the defeat was the club’s third
straight. Butcher scored 21 points,
and Tonya Sharpe added 12, but
Davidson could not overcome a
seven-point halftime deficit.

At home for the first time in
nearly a month on January 13,
Davidson held off Western Caro-
lina for 20 minutes, taking a 34-29
advantage at the half. The Cata-
mounts, the first Southern Confer-
ence foe of the season, returned to
overpower the ‘Cats as the game
continued, earning a76-52 victory;
Ferrucci sustained her broken leg
in the second half. Butcher con-
nected for 14 points and her sec-
ond consecutive nine-rebound
game; Sharpe and Maggie Young
each scored 13 for Davidson, which
saw its shooting percentage from
the floor drop from 57.7% in the
first half to 30.4% in the second.

On January 9, Davidson fin-
isheda five-game road trip by drop-
ping a 74-59 decision to Carnegie
Mellon, despite a 19-point, 10-re-
bound performance from Butcher
and 16 points from Young. The
previous evening, the ‘Cats raised
their record to 3-5 by defeating

Philadelphia Pharmacy, 84-60.
Young led Davidson with 17
points, followed by Sharpe’s 13,
Butcher’s 12 (and 13 rebounds)
and Ferrucci’s 11.

Davidson playedatight match
at Franklin & Marshall on January
6 before succumbing, 56-51.
Sharpeand Butcher paced the ‘Cats
with 17 and 14 points, respectively.

A January 2-3 tournament at
UNC Wilmington ushered in the
New Year for the ‘Cats, who were
topped, 91-53, by New Hampshire
in the second game. Young was the
lone Davidson member in double
figures, scoring 15 points.
Davidson fell, 78-70, to the host
school in the first round; Sharpe
led all scorers with 22 points, as
the club tried to come back from a
16-point halftime deficit. “The key

was that we scored points when the .

clock was stopped,” Filar said.
Sharpe hit eight of nine from the
free throw line, andRoos connected
on seven of eight.

Sharpe also scored 22 against
Lenoir-Rhyne at home on Decem-
ber 18 in an 84-71 defeat. Ferrucci
added 21 and Butcher 15, along
with 12 rebounds, to provide the
‘Cats with a balanced inside-out-
side attack. Six days earlier,
Davidson hit only 25% of its first-
half shots in losing, 71-40, at Lib-
erty. Ferrucci’s 15 points were high
for the club.

Davidson earned its second
victory of the year December 9 at
UNC-Asheville, notching a 62-48
win over the home squad. Ferrucci
and Sharpe each burned the Bull-
dogs for 18 points, followed by
Roos’ 11. Ferrucci pulled down 12
rebounds, and Butcher 11, to guide
the ‘Cats inside.

Assistant coach Claire Gardin
acknowledges that the team has
progressed rapidly since the sea-
son commenced, but insists her
goals remain the same. “We still
expect nothing but effort and in-
tensity; that’s all we’re asking for.”
