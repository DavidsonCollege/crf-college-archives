4 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Dave Love
Staff Writer

Students, administrators and health-
workers gathered last Tuesday to discuss
current issues of learning disabilities.

The talk was the brainchild of Davidson
College junior, Paul Gravel, who wants to
educate students and demystify the treatable
neuropsychological disorders that affect doz-
ens of Davidson’s students.

The talk included a seven-speaker panel

abilities from all possible angles. Two stu-

Some of the most common learning dis- : ee 2 ;
abilities are attention-deficit disorder (ADD) the d
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). Currently, ADHD is defined as
observable behavioral features that include a
short attention span, distractibility, impulsiv-
ity, and overactivity.

In taking the good with the bad, many
ADD people are privy to positive affects
from their learning disability. Edward M.
Hallowell, M.D. states, “Individuals with
ADD have visionary imaginations. They
think big thoughts and dream big dreams.
They can take the smallest opportunity and
imagine turning it into a major break. They
can take a chance encounter and turn it into a
grand evening out. They thrive on dreams, One
and they need organizing methods to make
sense of things and keep them on track.”

The steps to conquering a learning dis-
ability are diagnosing the condition, educa-
tion, structure and support, various forms of Prot
psychotherapy, and medication. The learn-
ing disability forum also stressed self-confi-
dence and knowing one’s strengths and weak-
nesses.

Students with learning disabilities can cannot smo!
be frustrated with the discrepancy between
what they are capable of and their ultimate illegal
performance. This dichotomy leads to con- Weal Student
siderable stress and frustrations.

Marsicano encourages students to speak
with their professors to discuss ways in which
the disability can be handled. She explained
that a blind student would not be expected to
perform a science lab with the same profi- verv had to balan
ciency as a student with sight. Learning :
disabilities can be just as hindering to a stu- the individu
dent and should be dealt with in a reasonable the

Rennick urges students with learning
disabilities to “not be ashamed of the help you
deserve.”
