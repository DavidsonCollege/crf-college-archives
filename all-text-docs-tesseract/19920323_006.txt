on the hall? (2) Do you feel that
noise is a problem on the hall? (3)
How many times this school year
has a student expressed concern
about noise on the hall to you? (4)
Do you feel that the current policy
for addressing excessive noise on
the hall is appropriate and ade-
quate?

Cook and Harkness found that
“the results of our survey deem
further resolutions about quiet
hours/dorms unwarranted and
unnecessary.” He said: “We (Cook

ing quiet dorms would be detri-
mental to renewing the ‘spirit of
community’ alluded to by Dr.
Kuykendall in his recent letter to
the college community. Quiet

“dorms would also avoid the root

problem: disrespect and intoler-
ance for others.”

A second survey was distrib-
uted to the entire student body on
March 10 by Residence Life Di-
rector Richard Terry. 48% of the
student body completed the sur-
vey. Terry concluded from the
survey that “the number of stu-
dents saying they would opt for a
quiet dorm/floor is so small [7%]
as to make setting up quiet halls
impractical. 49% of those com-
pleting the survey took the time to
make comments and over 90% of

those saw the issue as overblown,
a non-issue, misdirected energy,
the faculty nosing in on students’
lives, etc. Terry also proposed a
“better advised. strategy for deal-
ing with noise in residence halls.”
Dr. Alexander McKelway, a
member of the Faculty Executive
Council, asserted that “students
have the fundamental right to live
under the conditions they want.
- Students have the belief that the
faculty is forcing quiet halls on
them. Thisconceptioncouldn’tbe
farther from the truth. You would
always have to offer fewer spots
{on a quiet hall] than there are
requests for, so that no one would
have to live on a quiet hall without
wanting to.”
When asked if the faculty will

ever vote on the quiet dorm/hall
issue, McKelway responded that
the faculty will not vote on the
issue because, constitutionally they
do not have any power over stu-
dent life. Ultimately, McKelway
believes that the faculty’s goal is
being misrepresented. McKelway
explained that “we [FEC] are urg-
ing that those students that want to
live on aquiet hall be allowed todo
so.” McKelway believes that there

are more students than were shown
in Richard Terry’s survey that
would like to live on a quiet hall.
He also suggested that if quiet halls
were established that the students
living on them should make their
ownset of rules concerning noise.

The unrest over the quiet dorms/
halls issue seems to have arisen
through a lack of communication
between the students, faculty, and
administration,
