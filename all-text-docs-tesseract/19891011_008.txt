Freshmen on Patterson Court: “It's so big

By CURT BICKERS

Although the “crunch” of
scholastic endeavors has re-
turned to freshmen, the first
weekend (September 14) on
Patterson Court will hardly be
forgotten. Saturated with
mud, sweat and beer, a good
number of freshmen’s clothes
contain living proof of the ac-
tivities that occurred on the
Court.

Freshmen were given many
opportunities to indulge them-
selves. From barbecues to
band parties, hanging out to

hooking, freshmen were
dazzled, doused, beer-
goggled and numbedat Patter-

son Court. Freshmen learned,
among other things, how hard
it was to balance a cup. Patter-
son Court became, throughout

the weekend, a “hotbed of sin
and iniquity” for everyone
involved.

Since freshman impressions
of Patterson Court interest the
readers most, many _ inter-
views were conducted to gain
a clearer picture of what these
impressions were. The halls
‘selected for interviews were
Fourth Cannon, First
Richardson and Second East
Belk.

The first question asked was,
“What were your,impressions
of Patterson Court before your
first weekend down?” The
general consensus among
those interviewed was that the
Court was going to be a lot of
fun. They thought it was going
to be one huge party.

One freshman guy went so

What can you do to help?
’ CROP is an answer. CROP
is the name given to educa-

events for hunger sponsored

far as to say, “I thought it wasa

mystical, haunted place.” It
seemed as if excitement had
been building from the first
moment freshmen had heard
of the Court.

The second question was a
general polling question: “Do
you prefer beer or punch?”
The male population polled
responded overwhelmingly
with the first choice. The
women, in direct contrast,
voted for the second choice.

The third question evoked a
chuckle from each of the fresh-
men interviewees. In response
to “How messed up did you
get?,” one freshman male an-
swered, “Friday afternoon I
was a little overanxious and
consumed great quantities (of
alcohol) before 7 p.m. Need-
less to say, I slept through the
rest of the night's activities.”
Most freshmen did make it to
all of the functions but became
“comfortably numb” as the
weekend progressed.

When asked what the high-
light of their first weekend
was, several freshmen had in-

triguing replies. One girl said,
“I loved dancing in the rain
outside of KA to the Heebie
Jeebies.”

Dancing seemed to arouse
everyone's interest as several
First-Rich girls said, “We had
the best time dancing on the
tables at SAE.”

One guy remarked, “I was
confused--It was all a blur to
me.” One can sympathize with
this inebriated freshman due
to the poor campus lighting
alone.

The fifth question asked
was, “What are your impres-
sions of Patterson Court
now?” One female gave a sus-
picious reply: “It was sooo
big!”

A general response was that
freshmen were very excited
about being able to join houses.
An interesting response made
by one girl was, “You know,
it’s funny. With all of the
drinking going onat the Court,
there really was no pressure to
drink if one did not feel like it.”

Another girl said, “Itis going
to be hard for me not to spend

"7

all of my time down there.”

The sleep deficits incurred
by the freshmen interviewees
turned out to be quite small, as
napping by day seems to be a
common practice among
freshmen. One girl said about
the nights, “We were all in
drunken comas.” Partying
until dawn definitely requires
rest. In fact, First Rich and
Fourth Cannon had a flicker-
bali game Sunday. Conse-
quently, First Rich lost with a
score of 27-0.

The final, dreaded question
was, “How much work did
you accomplish?” One fresh-
man male jokingly said, “Not
enough to self-select.” The
midnight oil definitely burned
the next night. There has to be
a sacrifice made in order to
have unending bliss for two
full days and nights.

Overall, one might say that
freshmen received very favor-
able impressions of Patterson
Court. Although it may not

The Stones still satisfy a

BY MATT GOAD

The hype surrounding the
Rolling Stones is incredible.
The group hasbeen called “the
world’s greatest rock n’ roll
band.” Stones fans say that
“lots of bands have played
rock n’ roll, but only one band
is rock n’ roll.” This band sells
out shows instantly whenever
and wherever they play. They
are also my favorite rock band
of all time.

Consequently, I was expect-
ing a lot of lead singer Mick
Jagger, guitarists Keith
Richards and Ron Wood, bas-
sist Bill Wyman and drummer
Charlie Watts when the
brought their Steel Wheels
tour to Raleigh’s Carter-Finley

Stadium. They performed in
front of 58,500 fans on last Sat-
urday.

“Start Me Up” started off the
show, and for the most part,
the first several songs were
relatively new ones, including
“Sad, Sad, Sad,” “Between a
Rock and a Hard Place” and
“Mixed Emotions,” all from
their most recent album, Steel
Wheels.

Slim Whitman could have
been on stage for all I could tell
from where I was sitting, but
with the aid of giant television
screens and binoculars I could
get an idea of what was going
on up there. Jagger did his
usual antics--prancing around
the stage in tight black pants

and an overcoat with tails. He
also ‘played’ guitar on a few
numbers early in'the show.
After they got through the
newer songs the band turned
to some older classics from the
‘67 to '69 era. As Richards
nonchalantly strummed_ the
opening chords of “Honky
Tonk Women,” two giant in-
flatable women of the type
mentioned in the song’s title
were blown up on either side
of the stage, and the’ crowd
went wild, clearly showing
that they had come to hear
such oldies. Other classics fol-
lowed, including “You Can’t
