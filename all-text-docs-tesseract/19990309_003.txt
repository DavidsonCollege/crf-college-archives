THE DAVIDSONIAN

Before he was Dr. Evil

“So I Married an Axe Murderer’ reviewed

By Kye Erikson
Staff Writer

Do you think you have a rough life? Are the
tests and the papers starting to get to you? Well if
they are, I have something to say—it could be
worse. Your Dad. could be a verbally abusive
drunk who does nothing but walk around without
pants, glorifying Scotland. Then there are the
possibilities that your mother could hit on your
best friend, your brother could have a head the size
of an orange on a toothpick, and you could be
engaged to an axe murderer.

Of course this is not the lifestyle of the
average Davidson student, but if you have no idea
what I am talking about yet you have some home-
work to do. It is time to bone up on your knowl-
edge of classic films. I am talking about Mike
Myers break-through film “So I Married an Axe
Murderer.” This slapstick comedy recounts the
relationship between Charlie (Myers) and Harriet
(Nancy Travis), the apple of his eye. However,
these two have no ordinary relationship. Charlie
has problem—he compulsively breaks up with his
girlfriends for reasons ranging from kleptomania

to an overpowering odor of beef and vegetable. It

seems as though Charlie might finally be getting
over his fear of relationships as he grows closer to
Harriet. Unfortunately Charlie’s paranoia reaches
a new level when he visits the washroom and

to see in the Weekly World News an article which
his mother mentioned earlier about a woman who

married men and then murdered them on her
honeymoon. There were a total of three former

husbands. They all lived in various places and had
various professions from a lounge singer in Atlan-

tic City to a Russian Martial Arts expert in Miami.
Charlie immediately thinks that Harriet is the
honeymoon killer by putting the pieces of her life
together with the article. He tries to break off the
relationship.

When Charlie finally breaks up with Harriot
he regrets his decision. He makes it up to her with

awindow-side poem. On their honeymoon Charlie

begins to get suspicious and the plot reaches its
peak. What follows is a rooftop scuffle and
surprise ending.

I highly recommend this film. It is not only
a classic, but the roots of newer Mike Myers

characters can be
seen init. Itis easy
to perceive Wayne
in Charlie’s sarcas-
tic remarks to a
waitress in acoffee
shop. Dr. Evil also
surfaces in this
movie in facial ex-
pressions of
Charlie as he lis-
tens to his father’s
drunken rambling
about a head with
its own solar sys-
tem or about his ha-
tred of the one and
only Colonel.

If you
have not seen “So I
Married an Axe
Murderer,” go out
and watch it today.
Putaside those silly
problem sets, and
forget about those
papers. Most im-
portantly don’t
worry about any
remaining mid-
terms, there is one
more after it. Go
out and rent it to-
day.
