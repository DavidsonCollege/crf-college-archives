grueling, boxing-style workout that
has since taken on legendary status
in its own right — provided a mo-
ment to which players still point as
one of the season’s countless defin-
ing junctures.

After nearly four hours in op-
pressive humidity, Slagle ordered
his troops to complete one last 600-
yard run before they called it a day.
And coming down. the stretch,

as the starting center midfielder and

acaptain, the fiery leader was widely —

known as one of the team’s fittest
players — literally coughed up some
inspiration.

“That first day of practice was
the hardest we’d ever done,” Slagle
said earlier this month. “As he’s
doing this run, he’s leading the pack,
and instead of stopping to toss his
lunch” — a classic Slagle-ism for
vomiting — “he did it on the run
and finished first. They proved to
me at that point that they were ready
to play.”

Yet the Wildcats opened up their
typically demanding slate with a 4-

2 loss at Wake Forest Spt. 5 — a

relatively lackluster and inauspi-
cious way to begin what would ul-
timately become the most success-
ful season in the history of Division
I athletics at Davidson.

But it was virtually immediately
thereafter that Davidson gave the
local soccer boosters, a group that
grew exponentially as the season
progressed, a glimpse of what was
to come.

Forty-eight hours after the sea-
son-opening loss to the Demon Dea-
‘cons, the Wildcats knocked off
tenth-ranked Carolina 4-3. In the
home opener, they battled new No.
10 South Carolina to a 2-2 stale-
mate, as Ukrop’s 50th career goal
with 28 seconds left in overtime
gave Davidson the dramatic tie.

But it was another week until the
team first captured national atten-

tion. With a scoreless tie versus |

Duke Sept. 16in Durham, the Wild-
cats vaulted to No. 16 in the polls.

And exactly a month later, they
registered the biggest win in the
history of the program —the first of
many victories labeled as such that
year — by knocking off highly-

The Bruins were led by goalie
Brad Friedel, who started in net for
the U.S. that summer at the
Barcelona Olympics, and featured
two other starting national teamers.
In UCLA’s first 11 games, Friedel
— the eventual national player of
the year — had allowed just two
goals.

But Davidson put the ball past
him three times in a 3-1 upset.

“Homeward Bound,” the video that
recaps the Wildcats’ march to
prominence. “That’s something I'll
never forget. He knew we were
good, and we knew we were good.”

And the pollsters agreed, upping
Davidson to No. 9 in the nation.

But two straight losses in late
October — 3-0 at Coastal Carolina
and 3-2 at Furman — threatened to
end the festivities before they ever
really began.

Knowing full well the NCAA’s
stinginess when it came to handing
out at-large bids to relative no-
names suchas Davidson — the 1990
Wildcats were denied an opportu-
nity after finishing the season ranked
fifth regionally — Slagle jolted his
team with this eye-opening scenario:
Win the last five games or plan on
staying home come tournament
time.

And the all-or-nothing ultima-
tum worked to perfection; as the
Wildcats won their final five con-
tests by a combined score of 25-4.

With the last three — 9-1 over

With the tourney brackets set to
be announced Nov. 9 at 1:15 p.m.,
players and coaches gathered in the
basketball office — the soccer of-
fice didn’t have speakerphone —to
listen to the NCAA matchups and
learn their postseason fate.

“T was concerned,” Slagle said.
“And when we heard (we were in),
we almost didn’t hear who we were
going to play because we were
screaming so loud.”

UNC Charlotte — whether the
team knew it immediately or not —
was the opponent, setting up a show-
down the local media began billing
as the Battle of Mecklenburg
County.

And the two teams — the
county’s only two Division I soccer
programs — did not disappoint.
Playing in front of a raucous crowd
4,500 strong, the Wildcats and 49ers
battled to a 1-1 tie after regulation,

periods — Davidson’s overtime

“These guys achieved to their

And still are.

No, the 1992 Wildcats didn’t win
the national championship, falling
to San Diego in the semifinals. But

-it hardly even mattered.

Because they were not so much
playing the game of soccer as they
were preparing for the game of life.

And perhaps that’s why this com-

And they did it with energy, in-
