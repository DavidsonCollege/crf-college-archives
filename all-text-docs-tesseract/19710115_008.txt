Coble Talks About Term

sWith elections drawing
nigh andthe frantic pace of
his administration somewhat
slowed .by an_after-Christ-
mas lull, SGA President Ran
Coble agreed to sit down
with THE DAVIDSONIAN
and review the past year
politically.

Relaxing over coffee in
the Hub, Coble confided that
he saw the last year as one
of consolidation for the still
young SGA.

“We turned in new direc-
tions,’’ Coble said, ‘‘and as
4 result the Senate was able
to take far more meaningful
action than ever before.

“By avoiding off-campus
and national issues we were
able to circumvent much of
the controversy and hbicker-
ing of past years. Similarly,
by avoiding on-campus _is-
sues we cleared the Senate
floor of debate to make way
for action,’’ Coble said.

When asked about his or
rather the SGA’s greatest
accomplishment over the
past year, Coble remarked
that it had to be the exten-

“sion of the ‘“‘course drop”
period from ‘one to two

“Of course I had to be dis
appointed that the proposed
five week period was reject-
ed,’ he said .“‘T would have
compromised with a period
of one lunar month in length,
but apparently the faculty
decided to be more cautious
than that.”’

Astute
Davidson _ political scene
have long. speculated on the
long-range effects of Coble’s
victory last year over Tom
Opie and Lyman Parrigin in
the SGA election.

Giving his own views on
that campaign, Coble said,
“Tom was certainly a good
candidate for the position
but perhaps it's just as well
that he lost. I hear he is at
work in the Honors College
synthesizing some sort of
drug for the chentistry de-
partment.

‘Personally I would not
like to see that word (drug)
mentioned in the Senate be-
cause it might cause a need-
less consideration of cam
issues: First
drugs then sex, really the
Senate should not bother it-

‘“‘Also,’’ Smith said, ‘‘with
the extra money we can now

be possible to have at least

Relics Saat Noah’s Ark

According to the prelimin-
ary findings released yester-

~ day by a special archeolo-

gical investigative. team, the
artifacts discovered last_
summer by Davidson reli-
Max E.
Polley are in all probability
relics from ‘Noah's Ark.

The investigative team,
which has been intensely
analyzing and evaluating
Poley’s findings, drew spe-
cial attention’ to three, arti-
cles discovered by Polley
during his archeological dig
near ‘Mount Ararat in the
Middle East last summer.

First, the archeologists
cited a large earthen oven,
believed to have served the
dual purpose of heating the
living quarters of the Noah
family ‘and cooking the food
for the ship's human occu-
pants. 2!

It was also pa! inted out by
the investigators that such

an object would serve to
fy

self with student affairs.
“As for Lyman, well 7 he
certainly was a late bloom-
er, wasn’t he? I am referr-
ing to his active role in the
fraternity issue, of course.

“Really, a man with such
strong views should not be
in the Senate because he
might disrupt the stagna-
tion, perhaps stability is a
better word, we have work-
ed so hard to develop.”

In conclusion Coble refus:
ed to speculate on the up-
coming SGA -elections. ‘I
can only say,"’ he said,
“that I am sure. as in the
past the best man will win.”

Cohen Lectures

Alonzo Q...Cohen, noted
(Paraguayan philosopher, will
speak on Chinese semantical
structures at 7:15 a.m. Wed-
nesday in Love Auditorium.

Cohen, a personal friend
of Davidson professor Earl
MacCormac, is making one
of his rare personal appear-
ances as the first Spencer
(Memorial lecturer.

Among the many honors
accored the prolific Para-
guayan have been the
French Medal of .Honor, a
peerage from King George
VI and second runner-up as
the ‘‘Mecklenburg  Gazet-
te’s’’ intellectual of the year
for 1963, :

Cohen has written 12 books
including bestsellers ‘‘Syn-
tactical Structures in Primi-
tive Rainforest Cultures’
and —““Lust Story.”*

carnivores that shared the
Ark’s quarters. .

A small bronze nail was
also described by the arche-
ologist as being a ‘‘very
significant find.’ The nail
was very rusty and appear-
ed to have been put through
much use.

Furthermore, inscribed on
the side of the mail were the
remaining etchings of an
ancient Hebrew- phrase
which scholars have loosely
translated as ‘‘in Yahweh
we trust.”

Finally, and most signifi-
cantly, the archeologists not-
ed a much - decayed axe -
hewn plank of wood.
Through chemical analysis
the wood was determined to
be from the cedar forests
of the fertile crescent of the
Middle East, used primarily
for boats.

The fact that the plank
had been gnawed from the
inside greatly impressed
the investigating team, es-
pecially since the teeth-
markings appear to have
been made by at least five
different species of animals.

Through Carbon-l4 dating

procedures tthe archeologists |

have determined that the
relics are dated from 4021
to 4033 BrC., around the
same period of time when
Bibical scholars have tradi-
tionally placed the Great
Flood.

The three artifacts, along
with Polley's other findings,
have recently been’ placed
on dsiplay for the general
public in the Stowe Gallaries
of the’ Cunningham ‘Fine
Arts Building.

‘Abraham Goldstein, lead-
ing Hebrew archeologist re-

presenting the, Universi-
ty of Upper Brooklyn, con-
firmed the findings as being
authentic during his recent
visit to the Davidson cam-
pus.

“This is possibly the
greatest archeological dis-
covery since Napoleon's men
unearthed the Rosetta stone
in Egypt,"’ he said. ‘‘The
significance of such a find
is staggering. We may now
actually have within our
grasp the key to discover-
ing the missing link.”’

Goldstein would not Lied
ornate, hdwever.

‘Religious . leaders through-
out the world have reacted
to the discovery in varied
ways.Christian and Jewish
leaders, however have been
most enthusiastic.

The Rev. - William Gra
ham, noted Biblical experts
and friend. of God, when in-
formed of the conclusions
of the investigative team;
said that Polley’s discovery
“simply proves what » God
has been telling me for
years, that He does work in
mysterious -ways,even = to
the extent of using human
science and technology.

“This just all goes to
show that science’ does
prove-the authenticity, of the
Bible and the existence -of
God.”

Pope Paul VI, notified of
the discovery in his Vatican
headquarters, went immed-
iately into seclusion for
“prayer, mediatation, and
celebration,’’ according to
Vatican sources.

‘However, it has been re-
ported that he plans to
make a pilgrimage to Da-
vidson to view the artifacts,
after which he will’ retire
from public life.
