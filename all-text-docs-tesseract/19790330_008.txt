shots. Senior Joe Davis carded
a fine 74 tliat included four
consecutive birdies on the back

Baird who turned in a five over

Lady tennis team wins 5

This year’s women’s tennis
team, which coach Pat Miller
calls “definitely the strongest
team ever at Davidson,” prom-
ises.to have an excellent year
after beginning the season in
fine fashion. Following Tues-
day’s victory over UNC-Ashe-
ville, the Lady Cats are now 5-1
with other wins over Campbell,
Converse, Queens and Pfeiffer.
players from last year—Hope
McArn, Kirk Cameron, and
Anne, Stanback—and has been
greatly improved by the addi-
tion of two freshmen— Emmy
Knobloch and Adelaide Wilcox.
Knobloch has moved into the
top position on the team.

Junior Tanda Witherspoon
rounds out the top six (playing
in the 5th spot), and Miller
comments that ‘‘she has done
more work than anyone all year
for her place on the team.” The
team looks to do well in their
Division II matches and will be

a top contender in the state.

division tournament, which will
be hosted by Davidson April
19-21.

Still, there will be some tough
challenges between now and
then. Outside of the division,

they play schools with scholar-.

shipped players such as N.C.

State, Peace (which accounted.

for the only Davidson loss), and
Furman. Miller sees these
matches as giving her players
good regular season competi-
tion to prepare for post-season
tournament play..‘‘We haven’t
played great as a team yet so
these matches against tough
teams will be. a good test of our

ability.”’

highlighted by home contests
with High Point, Furman, and
Peace.

Tuesday’s victory was a good
example of the team’s potential.
They won 9-0 over UNC-Ashe-
ville and none of the sets were
even close. Kirk Cameron, the
team’s number three player,
commented, ‘‘Next’ week’s
matches will be tough, but we
have a lot of depth and everyone
is working hard, so we have a
good chance to do well.’’

Prior to the Western Carolina
victory, the Wildcats went to
battle with UNCC expecting a
tight match. Past encounters
had resulted in no more than a
two shot advantage for either
team. This match proved to be
no exception. After the final
putt was holed, Davidson and
UNCC were deadlocked at 390
shots apiece.

Jim Heard led all Wildcat
golfers, firing a superb 73 over
the tough Charlotte Country
Club layout. Sollie Foy, who
continued to play steadily this
spring, finished with a 76. A
pair of 79’s from L.D. Simmons
and Brett Storm and an 83 from
Mike Kennedy rounded out the
scores.

Early next week the squad
will head to Burlington NC, to
compete in the Elon Invitation-
al. The rapidly improving Wild-
cats appear primed for a strong
showing at Elon.

Men’s and women’s track teams
fall to Lynchburg in Saturday meet

By ROB GILLISON
Asst. Sports Editor

As first year sports go,
women’s track at Davidson is
very healthy. Althongh the
team will only participate in
three meets this year (Lynch-
burg last Saturday, Winston-
Salem this Saturday and the
Davidson Relays on April 7),
the team consists of 25 girls
with a strong crop of freshmen.

The two biggest contributors
are freshman Barbara Kelley,
who took second place in both
the long jump and 100 meter,
and freshman Diane Downing
who took first place in both the
200 and 400 meter races.

The girls were beaten by
Lynchburg 68-50, but coach
Dee Dee Mayes looked at the
loss rationally by saying, “The
girls all ran their best times or
went their greatest distances so
I have to be pleased with that.”

She also praised the girls for

* their dedication and enthusiasm

and is looking forward to the
rest of their short season.

The men’s track team also
competed against Lynchburg
Saturday unfortunately with
the same results; they lost
83-71. In a close meet the Cats
were able to sweep both weight
events and take first place in
several events.

Senior Doug Horn took first
place in the steeplechase. Ano-
ther senior, Dave Jones, took
first in the 400 meter hurdles.
Juniors Philip Gilbert and
Michael Heinig took firsts in
the long jump and javelin,
respectively. Sophomore)
Charles Landess captured the
5000 meter race, and freshman
Lance Sisco took firsts in both
the 110 meter high hurdles and
the high jump.

“We're working to improve
individually now,” said Coach
Karl Kremser. ‘‘We’ll only be
losing two seniors to graduation
and a good group of young kids
will be back.”’
