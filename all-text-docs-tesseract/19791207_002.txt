Barrett assumes editorship

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer
Sophomore Mark Barrett will
be the editor of The Davidsoni-
an starting in January. He was
the only person who filed for
candidacy.
Barrett will be the Davidsoni-
an’s first sophomore editor in
-many years. He is taking the
post as a sophomore because, he
said, “Ieam the best person for
the job; I would like to have
tmore experience, but the oppor-

tunity is here now.” Barrett .

said that to his knowledge he
fisthe only: high level staff
= member interested in the job.
The paper has been hurt by a
lack of continuity recently. be-
cause there have been five
since fall term of lest
year Barrett said: He. wants to
‘be careful to preserve the pa-
‘per’s stability. Therefore, he
will institute changés gradu-
ally, as he feels the paper
becomes ready. Barrett stressed
‘that these changes will be made
in conjunction with the staff. “I
want to be. an editor, not a
dictator, ” he said. .

“The paper can be a very
progressive force here,” Barrett
said, through effective editori-
als and through news coverage.
' He said that now the Davidson-
ian’s editorials simply present
an issue and its several sides
without taking a stand. “I feel
that the Davidsonian needs .to
‘take close looks at the issues
and definite stands on these
issues, including positive. pro-
posals.” _
‘Barrett said before the Dav-
idsonian can achieve its. poten-
tial, it must have more staft
members. ‘The people on the
staff now are dedicated, hard
working, and know their jobs
well, but they are overworked.”
He believes that a larger work
force will ultimately improve
the paper’s. quality because
“once we spread the workload
around, people will be less
pressured and will be able to do
their jobs better.”’

Barrett plans to go door to

door asking students what they
like and dislike about the paper,
asking for suggestions, and
recruiting contributors. He add-
ed that anyone interested in
working for The Davidsonian in
any capacity should contact
him

Barrett will increase the
length of most issues from eight
to twelve pages as soon as the
staff has grown enough. Great-
er length will provide room for
in-depth news analyses, invest-
igative reporting, news from the

Davidson area, items from the
College Press Service, and a
“better paper in general,’’ he
said.

Twelve page issues will also
allow the features department

'to expand coverage: to include

cultural events in Davidson and
Charlotte and to do more hum-
an interest stories, Barrett said.

Barrett would like to see the

sports department continue a .

trend toward more reporting on
upcoming contests and less

rehashing of past games and —

seasons.
He plans an ad program
based on that of former editor

Charles Erwin. By giving ad-  §

‘vertisers discounts for reserving
space in several future issues at
@ time, Barrett hopes to reduce

the workload: on. the business C
department and:achieve a more *:”
reasoned balance between ad-., ;

vertisements and copy.

‘Barrett's interést in journal-"
iom started in high schoo! where

he was a sports writer. He
started writing for The David-

sonian the first week of his’
freshman year. From January -

to May of this year Barrett
served as assistant news editor,
and he has been news editor
since September. He is consid-

“ering a career in journalism.

Union presidency and social veep are only are only contested posts

Julie Holding and Kevin
Wheelock will be vying for the
position of Union President in
next Tuesday’s campus-wide

elections. ,
Juniors David McLean and
Ben McCall will be running for
the Union’s Social Vice-
presidency. Both candidates
were allowed to file candidacies
late Wednesday night, after
the Tuesday deadline. As a

There will be no election next
week for any of the four Y

Student Service Corps posi-

tions, because only one can-

didate filed for each office.
Minor Sinclair is running

unopposed for the presidency;

Elizabeth Medlin for the vice- _

presidency; Katherine Allen for
the office of Secretary; and Chip
Legerton for the office of Trea-
surer.

Sinclair, a junior, has worked
with the Y off and on since his
freshman year. He has been a
STEP tutor, a North Mecklen-
burg YMCA basketball coach,
and the leader of the prison
visitation program.

Sinclair sees the Y’s major
problems as a for ‘‘greater
involvement by students in the
Y’s activities” and a need to
alleviate the Y's ‘‘separation
from campus life."’

Elizabeth Medlin, also a jun-
ior, has been a STEP tutor, a
worker in the Depot Lunch
program, and the Treasurer of
the Y for 1979.

Along with all the other

result, The Davidsonian was
unable to contact either of them
before press time.

Sophomore Carol Impara is
the only candidate for Union
Co-Curricular Vice-President.
She will be in charge of cultural
and educational programs.

Holding, a junior, said she is
running for President because,
“The Union needs strong stud-
ent leadership. Student: leader-
ship is needed not only in
representing the Union as a

Junior Allen has been a
STEP tutor and a member of
the step coordinating commit-

Allen plans to begin posting
the minutes of Y meetings to
make students more aware of
the Y and its programs.

Sophomore Legerton has
been involved with the Y for a
year and has worked on the
Energy Conservation Block and
with the Fall Fund Drive.

whole but in the ‘behind the
scenes’ work that makes Union
programs possible.”

“As Chairman of the Minor-
ities Committee this past year,
I feel I have gained a strong
background in Union affairs
and programs. Serving as a
Union Board member and
attending the Associated Col-

lege Unions International Re-
gional Conference has provided

good experience for..me,”’ she,
said.

In defining her goals for the
Union, Holding stated, ‘‘The
Union needs to be responsive to
student needs and reevaluate

types and numbers of commit-

tees which compose the Union
Board. Some money that is
spent is not distributed in
proportion with actual student
interests. I plan to find these
interests by conducting a
campus-wide survey in which
students will rate the Union
program. tad

“There needs to be stronger
student leadership and decision
making within the Union. This

can be done by encouraging |

increased decision making from
thevarious program committee
members as well as the commit-
tee chairmen.”

When asked his reasons for
running for Union President,
Wheelock, also a junior, said,
“T like to work with people and
motivate them to do the jobs
they need to do. The President

can’t do all the work, but should
be able to delegate his authority
to other individuals‘and oversee
the fact that they do their jobs.
The President needs to be
dynamic and concerned with the
needs of the school and the
interests of the students.”
main ete stated that his
is “to have participe-
tion in the Union from all areas

and factions of campus life.
The Student Union should serve
the diversity of the students.
Without it, campus life would
become a mindless academic
quagmire.”

«Wheelock plans to innovate
Union programs through dele-
gation of authority, to coordi-
nate Patterson Court and Union
activities to the fullest advan-
tage of Davidson students, and
to develop a_ promotional
brochure about the Union.

Wheelock has not worked in
the Union, but feels his lack of
experience will not hurt because
he would ‘‘have time to get
acquainted with the aspects of
the job in the 7 weeks between
Christmas and the start of the
new term.”” He went on to cite
the fact that current President
Jim Robertson, who “‘has filled
his position well,’’ held no
Union position prior to his term
of office.
